1
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,690
<i>This is the world. There are
almost six billion people on it.</i>

2
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,683
<i>When I was a kid there were three.
It's hard to keep up.</i>

3
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,250
<i>There, that's better. That's America.</i>

4
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,768
<i>America still sets
the tone for the world.</i>

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,805
<i>In Indiana, Clark Hodd.
The country's best point guard.</i>

6
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,404
<i>Last week he scored 100 points
in a single game.</i>

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,804
<i>Erica Sorgi.
You'll see her in the next Olympics.</i>

8
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,764
<i>In Seattle, Dallas Malloy, 16.</i>

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,163
<i>Her lawsuit paved the way
for women boxers.</i>

10
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,486
<i>She's picturing her ex-boyfriend.</i>

11
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,164
<i>In Indio, California. Art Stallings.</i>

12
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,966
<i>Check out what pure joy looks like.</i>

13
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:36,087
<i>In Odessa, Texas.
The great Frank Cushman.</i>

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,884
<i>This April, 26 teams will be falling
over themselves to sign him.</i>

15
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,601
<i>He's my most important client.</i>

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,724
When are you gonna try
and concentrate?!

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,006
<i>There's genius everywhere.
It's like popcorn. Some pop...</i>

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,249
Coach, you don't know
diddly about golf!

19
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,805
<i>...some don't.</i>

20
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:02,121
<i>I'm the guy you don't usually see.</i>

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,728
<i>I'm behind the scenes.
I'm the sports agent.</i>

22
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,651
I'm gonna hurt you this year.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,209
My door's always open if you
want to get a real agent.

24
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,204
You're welcome, Johnny.

25
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,764
I'll go to a meeting now to talk
about you. I'd kill for you.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:22,725
- We've gotta win.
- I hail you.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,925
Jerry, how are you doing?

28
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,763
- How much is this going to cost?
- We both know what you can afford.

29
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,327
I'll just write it down.

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,010
- I can't afford that.
- Winning isn't cheap.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,566
<i>You know the photos of
the new player with the owner?</i>

32
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,683
<i>That's me on the left.</i>

33
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,761
<i>This is where I work. SMI.
Sports Management International.</i>

34
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,131
<i>Thirty-three agents
guiding the careers...</i>

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,161
<i>...of 1685 of the most
finely tuned athletes alive.</i>

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,767
<i>I handle the lives and dreams...</i>

37
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,806
<i>...of 72 clients and get
264 phone calls a day.</i>

38
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,328
I will not rest until
you hold a Coke...

39
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,524
...in a new commercial
starring you...

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,526
...broadcast during a Super Bowl
game you're winning.

41
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,121
<i>It's what I do best.</i>

42
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,201
<i>I noticed a few years ago,
and didn't say a word.</i>

43
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,807
Was the girl 16 or 17?

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,924
<i>Wanting the big dollar,
things went wrong.</i>

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:35,530
There's no proof of anything.
This guy is a sensational athlete.

46
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,131
Are you Calvin Nack?
Can you sign my card?

47
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:44,528
I'm sorry, fella, I can't sign this.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,727
- Only Pro-Jam Blue Dot cards.
- Just wanted an autograph.

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,844
<i>Lately, it's gotten worse.</i>

50
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,606
<i>Oh, he goes down!</i>

51
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,887
Hi, baby.

52
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,084
Do you know your name?

53
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,967
Wait, it's coming.
My name is Steve Remo.

54
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,966
I play for Chicago.
This lady here is my wife.

55
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,206
Hi, baby.

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,962
This is my boy. And this is...

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,365
Wait.

58
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,567
My agent. My agent.

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,845
I gotta play this weekend.
If I play at 65 percent...

60
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,562
...I get a bonus.
I gotta get the bonus.

61
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,002
- Okay, Jesse. Take care, little guy.
- Mr. Maguire?

62
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,768
This is his fourth concussion.
Shouldn't he stop?

63
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,123
It would take a tank
to stop your dad.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,362
It would take all five...

65
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,481
...Super Trooper VR Warriors
to stop your dad.

66
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,881
Right?

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,246
Right?

68
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,564
Fuck you!

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,047
<i>Who had I become?
Just another shark in a suit?</i>

70
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:38,081
<i>- -skyrocketing salaries, and you
are one of the guys responsible.</i>

71
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,290
<i>He's a sensational athlete.</i>

72
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,490
<i>Two days later, at our Miami
conference, a breakthrough.</i>

73
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,648
<i>I have $18 million...</i>

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,764
<i>Breakdown? Breakthrough.</i>

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,641
<i>- I just wanted an autograph.
- Do you know your name?</i>

76
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,961
<i>I couldn't escape one simple thought:</i>

77
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,643
<i>I hated myself.</i>

78
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,970
<i>No, here's what it was:</i>

79
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,169
<i>I hated my place in the world.</i>

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,289
<i>I had so much to say,
no one to listen.</i>

81
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,323
<i>And then it happened.</i>

82
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,048
<i>It was the oddest,
most unexpected thing.</i>

83
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,087
<i>I began writing what they call
a mission statement, not a memo.</i>

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,767
<i>A suggestion
for the future of our company.</i>

85
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,842
<i>A night like this doesn't
come along often. I seized it.</i>

86
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:53,606
<i>What started out as one page
became 25.</i>

87
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,003
<i>Suddenly, I was
my father's son again.</i>

88
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,364
<i>I was remembering
the simple pleasures of this job.</i>

89
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,889
<i>The way a stadium sounds
when my player performs well.</i>

90
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,603
<i>The way we're meant to protect them,
in health and in injury.</i>

91
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,004
<i>With so many clients,
we had forgotten what was important.</i>

92
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,287
<i>I wrote and wrote and wrote.
And I'm not even a writer.</i>

93
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,401
<i>I was remembering my mentor's
words, Dicky Fox, who said:</i>

94
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,690
The key to this business
is personal relationships.

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,410
<i>Suddenly, it was all pretty clear.
The answer was fewer clients.</i>

96
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,961
<i>Less money. More attention.</i>

97
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,243
<i>Caring for them,
caring for ourselves.</i>

98
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,131
<i>Just starting our lives really!</i>

99
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,406
<i>I'll be the first to admit,
what I was writing was touchy-feely.</i>

100
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,042
<i>I didn't care.
I've lost the ability to bullshit.</i>

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,080
<i>It was the me I'd always
wanted to be.</i>

102
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,440
<i>I took it to a Copymat
and printed up 110 copies.</i>

103
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,127
<i>The cover looked like
Catcher in the</i> Rye.

104
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,082
<i>I</i> entitled it,
The Things We Think and Do Not Say:

105
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,561
The Future of Our Business.

106
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,326
That's how you become great, man.

107
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,322
Hang your balls out there.

108
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,970
Thanks.

109
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:29,849
<i>- Everybody got one.
- Some animals walk on two feet.</i>

110
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,128
<i>They don't want peace.</i>

111
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:37,609
<i>Society needs protection
from these warped minds.</i>

112
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,327
<i>Boom!</i>

113
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,690
This is Jerry Maguire.
Did those manuscripts...?

114
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,161
<i>- They've all gone out.
- They did?</i>

115
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,290
No, that's fine.

116
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,130
Thank you.

117
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,807
Finally, somebody said it.

118
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,209
- Good work, Maguire.
- Yeah, yeah!

119
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,403
<i>I was 35.</i>

120
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,240
<i>I'd started my life.</i>

121
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,283
- How long do you give him?
- About a week.

122
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,842
- You're with the sports people?
- Jerry Maguire, SMI.

123
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:27,130
Bobbi Fallon, BPI.
I'm producing the Coke commercials.

124
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,283
Well, good luck with that.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,722
Hi, my son is allergic
to the blankets. I was wondering...

126
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,491
That's all we have, okay?

127
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:48,090
- I'm sorry if I was rude just now.
- That's okay. We're in it together now.

128
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,285
Why is it so easy to talk with you?
Tell me about your fiancée.

129
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,888
- We're not at your pitch yet.
- Tell me how you proposed.

130
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,323
Honey, are you all right?
Do you want some juice?

131
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,561
Thank you.
We're hiking up through the pools.

132
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,970
Got the ring in my pocket.
I'm a little nervous.

133
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,087
I'm lagging. She says to me...

134
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,483
...get this:
"Hurry up, klutz."

135
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:21,447
It bothered me somewhat.
I got quiet. Then she got quiet.

136
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,322
I decide I'm not gonna propose.
The mood is not right.

137
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,084
At this point I know she knows
that I was gonna propose.

138
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,367
She knows I know.

139
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,370
- So we check back into the hotel.
- How sad.

140
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:42,323
Little do I know that my assistant
assumed that I've now proposed.

141
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,282
She's got a band to play "Here Comes
The Bride" when we walk in.

142
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:51,042
- I love it.
- All the football guys are watching.

143
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,886
There's even an ESPN crew.

144
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,567
So I turn to her, sort of grandly say:

145
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,565
"This is me, klutz, asking you...

146
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,486
...goddess of rock climbing,
to marry me."

147
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:10,130
I took out the ring. I mean,
I don't much like big scenes...

148
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,566
...but she said yes right there.

149
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,804
Some of the toughest men
in football wept.

150
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:23,770
- We're getting married in February.
- You'll be married forever.

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:34,930
- What's wrong, Mom?
- First class is what's wrong, honey.

152
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,002
It used to be a better meal,
now it's a better life.

153
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,730
Ray?

154
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,850
Ray?!

155
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,207
Come on, buddy!

156
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,528
- High five!
- Ray!

157
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,721
- Oh, God. Ray!
- Excuse me, can I help you?

158
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,529
Jerry Maguire.

159
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,289
I work in your office.
I was on a junket.

160
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,131
I know, Dorothy Boyd in Accounts.

161
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,446
You have this poster of Einstein's
face on Shaquille O'Neal's body.

162
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,724
That's pretty good.

163
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,566
- What did you lose?
- My son, my mind.

164
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,121
Ray! Ray!

165
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,967
Listen, Dorothy. Dorothy?

166
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,647
While I go look for him,
grab this gentleman here.

167
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,050
You scared me. You scared me!

168
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,687
- Don't do that again, ever!
- Okay, Mommy.

169
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,685
Ever, ever, ever! Okay? Ever!

170
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,251
Dorothy?

171
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,960
- Take care.
- Thank you so much.

172
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,607
I loved your memo, by the way.

173
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,802
- You did?
- Yeah.

174
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,284
Thanks. Actually, it was
just a mission statement.

175
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,842
In this age,
optimism is a revolutionary act.

176
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,284
- You think so?
- Yeah.

177
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,530
I appreciate that.
I didn't know if I should write it.

178
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,170
It was 2:00 in the morning.
Some of the stuff I just, you know...

179
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,203
No. That part about
embracing what is virginal...

180
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,044
Just a second.

181
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,690
...and force commerce to give
a little back for the greater good.

182
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:46,808
God, I was inspired,
and I'm an accountant, you know?

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,562
I mean, to respect yourself
enough to say it out loud.

184
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,203
To put yourself out there
like that, so nakedly.

185
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,404
I don't know. It got me.

186
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,131
Is this bothering you?

187
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,842
No, this is great.

188
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,808
- It's great.
- One, two, three!

189
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,681
Do you need a ride? You okay?

190
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,331
- What?
- Need a lift?

191
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,768
Oh, no! Yeah, I'm sure
that would just make your day.

192
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,925
To drive us out to Manhattan Beach.
Little tiny streets.

193
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,603
Playing chicken with traffic.
Your life flashing before you.

194
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,367
- I've obviously had too much coffee.
- No problem.

195
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,527
Oh, there's my sister, Laurel,
to pick us up.

196
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,365
Ray...

197
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,040
...Dorothy.

198
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,085
Pleasure.

199
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,565
Bye.

200
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,683
Hey, Ray, hey you.
I'm double-parked, let's go.

201
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,764
Sorry, honey. Is this everything?

202
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,243
- Come here.
- Dorothy?

203
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,648
Man, whoever snagged him
must be some classy babe.

204
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,362
Don't ever stop fucking me!

205
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,088
Sooner or later we'll have to stop!

206
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,841
Never been better! Never better!

207
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,651
Never better!

208
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,764
Open your eyes.

209
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,404
If you want me to be with another
woman for you, I would do it.

210
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,525
I'm not interested in it.
At a time it felt normal.

211
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,884
But it was a phase. A college thing.

212
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:57,602
Like torn Levi's
or law school for you.

213
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,888
Want anything from the kitchen?

214
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,726
You don't have to tell me everything.

215
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,128
This is what intimacy is.

216
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,604
We have dinner
with Wade Cooksy tomorrow.

217
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,882
I know about the party.

218
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,329
Your buddy worked
his ass off for this.

219
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,962
All the guys from the office
are coming.

220
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,650
Calm down, relax, act surprised,
and have an amazing time.

221
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,169
- Oh, my God. You! You!
- Sorry.

222
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,209
Jerry!

223
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,724
Got you!

224
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,446
- Hey, college buddy. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

225
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,288
- For you.
- Thank you.

226
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,884
And this is for you.
Finest cigar my club has to offer.

227
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,049
This is what it's all about, man.

228
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,330
Everybody loves you.

229
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,449
Pisses me off!

230
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,842
<i>Whether you're country,
redneck or a freak...</i>

231
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,250
<i>...young or old, from Moscow,
London or Memphis...</i>

232
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,565
<i>...Jerry Maguire will still
be the king of rock 'n' roll.</i>

233
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:36,084
<i>- Little black book.
- When I think of him, my heart pounds.</i>

234
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,445
<i>- I know Jerry pretty well.
- Hi, Jerry, remember me?</i>

235
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,445
We still on for lunch?

236
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,722
<i>He was no slouch in bed.</i>

237
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,123
This is the funniest thing.
See you later.

238
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:52,763
<i>- -Good idea that Jerry get married.
He won't be alone.</i>

239
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,406
<i>- He cannot be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

240
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,840
<i>He's almost phobic.</i>

241
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,602
<i>Jerry is great at friendship,
he's just bad at intimacy.</i>

242
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,929
<i>- He can't be alone.
- He can't be alone.</i>

243
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:10,291
<i>- He can't say, "I love you."
- He's an agent. He lies.</i>

244
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,962
<i>- I love you too.
- Hey, love you too.</i>

245
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,731
<i>- Love you too.
- Love you.</i>

246
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,087
I love you, man.

247
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,001
<i>- I love you.
- I love you.</i>

248
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,565
- Morning, Jenny.
- Sorry I missed the party.

249
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,366
Good morning, Jerry. Marcee's here.

250
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,524
She's late for her plane to Phoenix.

251
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,808
- Marcee.
- You finally made it.

252
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,287
Rod is very, very upset.

253
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,051
- Tyson, no!
- Okay, Mommy.

254
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,489
- Tyson, hello.
- Long time no see!

255
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,206
- Tyson!
- How can I help?

256
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,525
Jerry, I'm pregnant,
and I'm incapable of bullshit.

257
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,404
Where is our offer?

258
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,968
- Cronin's for lunch?
- This is Bob Sugar.

259
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,730
- Knock.
- Pleasure.

260
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,802
- You've called our house.
- Sorry to interrupt.

261
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,801
I don't know what you do,
but my husband has an image.

262
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,006
Putting him in a waterbed commercial?
You're making him common.

263
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,007
He deserves the big four:
Shoe, car, clothing, soft drink.

264
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,891
I know about the four
endorsement jewels.

265
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,570
- Wow.
- He and I majored in marketing.

266
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,966
We came to play!

267
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,009
The dirty man is back!

268
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,167
- Hey.
'Hey!

269
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,170
You Okay?

270
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,449
- Fine. What's up?
- Came here to let you go.

271
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,082
- Pardon me?
- Came here to fire you, Jerry.

272
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,841
It's real.
You should say something.

273
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:24,525
Shit.

274
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,081
A crowded restaurant
so there won't be a scene.

275
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,007
- You ungrateful...
- You need to see yourself.

276
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,762
You said fewer clients,
you put it on paper.

277
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,641
You know what I went through?
Fire my mentor?

278
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,010
Carrying that for a week?
Could you get past yourself?

279
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,609
- You'll lose.
- You want smaller.

280
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,242
Now I want all my clients
and yours too.

281
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,841
Whatever.

282
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,527
Wendy, bring me my numbers.

283
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,644
- Cush.
<i>- Cush, it's Sugar.</i>

284
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,081
<i>Look, you're the most important guy
in sports. How does that feel?</i>

285
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,330
I just wanna play football.
Dad, one of the agents.

286
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,610
Wendy, Cushman's line is busy!
Call till you get through.

287
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,689
And bring me my numbers!

288
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,680
J.J., what's up?
Have you talked to Maguire?

289
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,885
He had a meltdown.
I've talked to Doritos about you.

290
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,566
They're interested. Talk to Rick.

291
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,484
Martinez...

292
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,526
Carlo, right now you
pay 25 percent to SMI.

293
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,240
I'd cut my commission by 7 percent.

294
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,121
I don't know if it was drugs,
but the guy freaked.

295
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,365
Do you want him representing you?
How's your mom?

296
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,564
I'm gonna make this easy for you.

297
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,730
Just what does your heart tell you?

298
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,331
Sorry to hear that.

299
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,321
- Hey, what's going on?
- They've fired Jerry Maguire.

300
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,445
SMI, this is Cleo. Hey!

301
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,248
You're making a mistake.

302
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:05,242
I'm concerned about your family
and your future.

303
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,808
I have a long relationship with SMI.

304
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,646
Does he know what it's like
to be black?

305
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,326
Bob Sugar? He's...

306
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,040
He's entertaining, funny.

307
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,165
I don't know what it's like
to be black? I'm Mr. Black People!

308
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,886
Don't make it harder than it is.

309
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:28,569
I've got to be honest,
this is very distressing for me.

310
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,691
Remember that stripper's name?
I do, it was April.

311
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,324
That's my job. It's not about
the money, I do it all for you.

312
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,884
- Still holding for Katarina.
- I'm talking about money.

313
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,600
It's been a great day.

314
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,963
Are you in or out? It's show business.

315
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,084
You are in.

316
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:57,451
- That's good.
- I wanna cry for what they did to you.

317
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,848
<i>If it wasn't for the Acura deal,
you know I'd go with you.</i>

318
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:07,688
Oh, Jerry. Oh, God!

319
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,525
Call waiting.
Who could be calling me now?

320
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,087
- Hi, Kathy Sanders.
- Still me.

321
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,607
Kathy, why are you crying?
Oh. So you're in?

322
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,730
Rod, Jerry Maguire.
How are you doing?

323
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,925
Jerry Maguire! How am I doing?

324
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:36,607
I'll tell you.
I'm sweating my contract.

325
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,640
Bob Sugar says
I'm missing out by being with you.

326
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:45,044
- That's how I'm doing.
- That's why I'm calling.

327
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:49,404
No, I hear that.
But do you truly hear what I'm saying?

328
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,646
- I heard you say it, Daddy.
- The best thing is getting together.

329
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:59,243
<i>- Would you mind holding?
- Didn't you say more attention?</i>

330
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:05,530
- Didn't you tell my wife that?
- I said more personal attention.

331
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:11,045
<i>Good! We're just getting started
on the things you need to know.</i>

332
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,005
I will kill for you.
I will maim for you.

333
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,323
I am a valuable commodity!

334
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:23,010
I see a dude out to kill me,
I tell myself, "Catch the ball."

335
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,084
Touchdown! I make miracles happen.

336
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,163
Are you in or out?

337
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,927
<i>I'm from Arizona.
I broke Arizona records.</i>

338
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,403
I went to Arizona State!
I'm a Sun Devil!

339
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,922
- And now you want Arizona dollars.
- Exactly.

340
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,808
Jerry, I'm sitting here
with an ant problem. I got ants.

341
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,526
My brother's room is flooded.

342
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,843
- Rod.
- We got a flood in his room.

343
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,690
Say hello to Maguire.

344
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,491
- Hello, brother Maguire.
- Hello, Tee Pee.

345
00:26:54,680 --> 00:27:00,130
My house is falling apart!
Nobody's looking out for Rod Tidwell.

346
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,881
And I'm supposed to be a superstar.

347
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,367
I need a decision. In or out?

348
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,286
You're gonna be so happy
you stayed with Bob Sugar!

349
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:15,521
<i>I am a role model.
I have a family to support! Hear me?</i>

350
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,445
I want my contract in Arizona!

351
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,564
<i>But I like you. Yes, I like you.</i>

352
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:25,725
My wife likes you.
You're good to my wife.

353
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:29,083
- I will stay with you.
- That's great.

354
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,560
<i>- Are you listening?
- Yes.</i>

355
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,889
<i>That's what I'm gonna do for you.
God bless.</i>

356
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,641
<i>This is what you'll do for me...
Are you listening?</i>

357
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:41,845
What can I do for you?
Just tell me, what can I do?

358
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,005
It's a very personal,
very important thing.

359
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,969
It's a family motto.

360
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,571
- You <i>ready?</i>
- Ready.

361
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,848
<i>Making sure you are, brother.</i>

362
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,085
Here it is:

363
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,644
Show me the money.

364
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,121
Show...

365
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,288
<i>...me the...</i>

366
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,289
...money!

367
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,362
Doesn't that make you feel good?

368
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,327
<i>- Say it with me, Jerry.
Show you the money.</i>

369
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,769
You can do better than that! Say it!

370
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,090
<i>- Bob Sugar's on the other line.
- Show you the money.</i>

371
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:26,808
- No, not you, show me the money.
- Show me the money.

372
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,002
- Louder!
- Show me the money.

373
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,044
<i>- You got to</i> yell!
<i>- Show me the money!</i>

374
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,921
- I need to feel you.
- Show me the money!

375
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,805
Show me the money!

376
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:42,642
Show me the money!

377
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,083
- You love this black man.
- I love the black man!

378
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,449
- Show me the money!
- I love black people!

379
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,324
I love black people!

380
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,326
- Who's your motherfucker?
- You're my motherfucker!

381
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:59,849
- What you gonna do, Jerry?
- Show me the money!

382
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,846
Congratulations,
you're still my agent.

383
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,846
Well, don't worry.

384
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,206
I won't do what you think I will...

385
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,488
...which is just flip out!

386
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,648
Let me just say...

387
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,290
...as I ease out
of the office I helped build.

388
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:59,245
I'm sorry, but it's a fact...

389
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:03,730
...that there's such a thing
as manners.

390
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,687
A way of treating people.

391
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,402
These fish have manners.

392
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,291
These fish have manners.

393
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,402
In fact, I'm starting a new company...

394
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,610
...and the fish will come with me.

395
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,844
Call me sentimental...

396
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,044
...but the fish are coming with me.

397
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,010
Okay.

398
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,330
If anybody else
wants to come with me...

399
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,689
...this will be a moment
of something...

400
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:54,129
...real and fun and inspiring...

401
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,130
...in this godforsaken business...

402
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,840
...and we will do it together.

403
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,449
Who's coming with me?

404
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,290
Who's coming with me?

405
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,442
Who's coming with me?!

406
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,165
Who's coming with me
besides Flipper here?

407
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,802
This is embarrassing.

408
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,565
All right.

409
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,609
Wendy.

410
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,731
- Shall we?
- Oh, Jerry...

411
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,322
...I'm three months away
from the pay increase.

412
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,406
Okay.

413
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,924
Okay.

414
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,211
I will go with you.

415
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,684
Dorothy Boyd, thank you.

416
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,642
Right now?

417
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,803
Don't do it.

418
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,724
Bye.

419
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,885
We'll see you all again.
Sleep tight.

420
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,685
Let's see how they do without us.

421
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,885
Thank you.

422
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,924
You will have
a medical program, right?

423
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,567
Sure, yes, medical.

424
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,484
I don't know.

425
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,606
When you think about
what you did, don't panic.

426
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,087
We're gonna be great.

427
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,961
We're gonna be great!

428
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,202
I wonder what he said.

429
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,251
My favorite aunt is hearing-impaired.

430
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,848
He just said, "You complete me."

431
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,644
That's a good point.
We come to support each other...

432
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,690
...but we don't listen to one another.

433
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,448
Women are taught not to
see each other as good people.

434
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,850
We see each other as enemies.
We compete over men, jobs...

435
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:45,166
- It's true, we compete.
- I used to really hate women.

436
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,570
And then I met you guys,
and you're like me.

437
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,481
It's important because
I know you can be my friends.

438
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,924
- What about medical?
- Of course.

439
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,686
A single mother can't be frivolous.

440
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,250
If you read what he wrote, you'd have
left too. And there are other jobs.

441
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,445
- Do you know the cost of child exams?
- Yes, $150.

442
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,489
And that's when he's well.

443
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:15,401
- Where is Ray?
- Asleep in the living room.

444
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,682
Next time you lecture me...

445
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,323
...don't leave my boy alone
with that divorced women's group.

446
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:26,764
So I finally, finally
got in touch with my anger.

447
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,207
What did I do?

448
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,247
Function, function.
Forward motion is everything.

449
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
Cush saves all.

450
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,609
You go to Texas. Keep one superstar,
and they'll all follow.

451
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,490
There's no loyalty.

452
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,042
The first person
who told me that was you.

453
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,961
- I was trying to sleep with you.
- Well, it worked.

454
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,371
And I will not let you fail.
You are Jerry Ma-fucking-guire!

455
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:08,365
- That's right.
- King of the house calls!

456
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,530
- Master of the living room.
- Okay, okay.

457
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,243
- Okay, this is working.
- You are not a loser.

458
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,485
- Who said anything about "loser"?
- Mistake. Wrong word! Let's leave.

459
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,404
I'm in the back den, Jerry.

460
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,610
- Would you like a bloody beer?
- I'm fine.

461
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,047
Beer and tomato juice.

462
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,125
I'm fine.

463
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,205
We've spent a lot
of time together, Matt.

464
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,966
You know I care about you
and your son.

465
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:14,245
You know I'm a straight shooter.
If you stay with SMI...

466
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,364
We decided to stay with you.

467
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,488
I'm not really a hugger.

468
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,209
I can't let go.

469
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,531
I told myself, "if he shows up,
we stick with him."

470
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,607
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Cush.

471
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,604
How are you?

472
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,568
- You remember Keith?
- Yeah.

473
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,368
I want him to go number one
in the draft, and I want him to play.

474
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,127
It'll either be Denver or San Diego.
He'll go first.

475
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,567
I'll either surf or ski.

476
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,401
- Denver's where he should be.
<i>- I'll</i> give it everything.

477
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:04,527
You know I don't do contracts,
but what you do have is my word.

478
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,806
And it's stronger than oak.

479
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:02,603
- Hello.
- Dorothy? Jerry Maguire.

480
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,283
- Is Avery there?
- She had an NFL meeting in Atlanta.

481
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,841
- Jerry.
- Hello? Hello?

482
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,841
Sorry, that was my son and the nanny.

483
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:21,802
- They're in our office?
- Nanny? I prefer child technician.

484
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:26,807
I had the calls transferred
to my house so I could work here.

485
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,480
<i>That's fine. Dorothy, we are back.</i>

486
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,883
We are so very, very back.

487
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,202
I re-signed Cush. We're set.

488
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,887
- I am so happy for you.
- Happy for us.

489
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,408
Happy for us. Okay, happy for us.

490
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,246
Rod, being at the draft is good.

491
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:49,769
No, Rod, just get on the plane
and meet us at the gate.

492
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,645
- Good. See you there.
- God <i>bless.</i>

493
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,327
Avery will meet you
at the B-gate at 4:15.

494
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,485
Do you know the human head
weighs eight pounds?

495
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:07,050
Did you know Troy Aikman, in six
years, has passed for 16,303 yards?

496
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,001
- Bees and dogs can smell fear.
- I booked Tidwell at the Marriott.

497
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,641
- Does he smoke?
- I don't know.

498
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,205
Did you know Pete Rose has 4256 hits
and he's not in the Hall of Fame?

499
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,730
Do you know that my neighbor
has three rabbits?

500
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,602
I can't compete with that.

501
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:34,250
- So did we go over everything? Yes?
- Yep.

502
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,888
- Back on Tuesday, right?
- Yeah.

503
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:43,084
Ray, have fun at school. Wish me luck.

504
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,408
Luck!

505
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,928
- Hey, Rod.
- Hey, Jerry...

506
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,565
Cush, how are you, man?

507
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,564
Jerry, we should be selling these.

508
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,327
This is my agent,
you might want his autograph.

509
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,244
My hand's getting tired.

510
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,330
- Excuse me.
- What's happening?

511
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,324
Are you Hootie?

512
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,565
No, I am not Hootie.

513
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,009
What is it gonna be,
San Diego or Denver?

514
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,124
I'll surf or ski.

515
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,607
He'll either surf or ski.

516
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:58,930
Rod, at last I find you.

517
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,210
Why am I here? It's like I'm
five years late for the prom.

518
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,611
- Nobody gives a damn about me.
- Let's walk through this lobby.

519
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:14,250
I want all the media and player reps
to see you for what you are:

520
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:17,489
The best-kept secret in the NFL.

521
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:23,686
The most commanding wide receiver.
You're fast, fierce, charismatic.

522
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,645
You're the man.
You are the man! Ready?

523
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:27,801
Let's go.

524
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,689
Let's walk.

525
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,883
The fiercest. You are the man.

526
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:38,523
- Let's do it.
- Hi, Mel. Hi, Torn.

527
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,921
Where's Cush?

528
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,205
Good thing you held onto Cushman.
San Diego or Denver?

529
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:49,844
I want you to meet Rod Tidwell,
110 catches, 1550 yards last year.

530
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:13,447
Now I wanna talk about Rod Tidwell.
A fierce receiver.

531
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,686
I came all that way
just to walk the lobby.

532
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,004
It might have even worked.

533
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,926
Yeah? Let's do that shit again.

534
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,403
Shooting a Reebok ad down there.
Where are my endorsements?

535
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,003
I didn't get no love from Chevy,
no love from Pepsi.

536
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,801
I didn't get no love from
that Energizer Bunny or Nike.

537
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,771
Obviously, I didn't get
love from Reebok.

538
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,369
- Did I tell you my Reebok story?
- I gotta get back to Cush.

539
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,845
Oh, your golden paycheck.
But wait, I'll boil it down for you.

540
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,769
Fuck Reebok!

541
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,844
All they do is ignore me.
Always have.

542
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,929
Always have.

543
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:14,161
You know what was great down there?
You unloaded that large chip...

544
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,044
...on your shoulder.

545
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,726
And you let people in.

546
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,243
You were brilliant.

547
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,765
- Brilliant?
- Brilliant.

548
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,442
- Really?
- Take care, I'll see you tomorrow.

549
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,606
- You love me now?
- I'm about showing you the money!

550
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,811
I was just testing you,
but to hear you say that...

551
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,408
...makes me love you, baby.
You know?

552
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,762
Jerry, come back!

553
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,964
- How was your flight?
- Good.

554
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,282
- What size are you?
- 12 and a half.

555
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:54,166
Grab a couple pairs
of them new shoes by the door.

556
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,451
Cush, Matt, we have
a decision to make.

557
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,402
San Diego just came in with
a last-minute scenario. It's big.

558
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,603
He's got to go number one.

559
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,601
San Diego wants to trade up
with Denver. They want him bad.

560
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,169
- What about Denver?
- This stuff happens before a draft.

561
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,845
San Diego, Matt...

562
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:29,722
...they're offering seven years
for 30. Signing bonus of 8.

563
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,606
- Should I unplug the phone?
- Reporters keep calling.

564
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,247
You just be friendly
and say, "No comment."

565
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,243
I'm no good at talking
and saying nothing.

566
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:45,201
Well, let me...

567
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,490
For you, it's a pleasure.
This is Cush.

568
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:54,681
<i>It's Sugar. Is Maguire there?
Sniff if he is.</i>

569
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,441
Remember, you're in
with the big boys now.

570
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,690
<i>Let your dad talk,
and know that I got you the deal.</i>

571
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:06,447
<i>This is business, not friendship.
Be strong...</i>

572
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,001
<i>...because you're global now.</i>

573
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,165
Okay, buddy? See you later.

574
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,130
No comment.

575
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,924
- He's got it wrong.
- You're on TV again.

576
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:31,891
I'm sick of me, already.

577
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:48,522
Before I go back to Denver,
we should put something on paper.

578
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,331
Something that says you're with me.

579
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,961
Not right now, Jerry.

580
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,921
Do I know everything
there is to know here, Matt?

581
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:10,563
You're not talking
with Bob Sugar, are you?

582
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,966
Apparently, Denver would only
deal with him.

583
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,690
Said who? Sugar?

584
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,085
I'm learning as I go.

585
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,846
So you empowered him
to deal with Denver behind my back?

586
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,202
I'm sorry...

587
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,003
- I love my son.
- I love your son!

588
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:39,282
I brought Denver to 20 million.
They always deal with me.

589
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,684
You listened to Sugar.
Bob Sugar, Matt, is a child.

590
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,601
You let that snake in the door?

591
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:55,724
Listen, rookie mistake.
I'll fix this Denver thing for you.

592
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:59,009
You didn't sign anything
with Sugar, right?

593
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:05,843
Matt? Tell me you didn't sign.

594
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,611
Because I'm still sort of
moved by your...

595
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,765
..."my word is stronger
than oak" thing.

596
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,324
We signed an hour ago.

597
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,091
You were in the lobby
with the black fella.

598
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,607
Sorry, Jerry.
I just want to play football.

599
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:37,242
- What do I do? How do I spin it?
- Honey, it's spun.

600
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,881
What did I do to you?

601
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,929
It's all about you, isn't it?

602
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:47,160
"Soothe me, save me, love me."
I have to finish my job.

603
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:49,442
Everything's on the run.

604
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:53,241
You and I are sales people.
We sell.

605
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,240
It's not "Love me"
or "Trust my handshake"...

606
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,569
...it's "Make the sale!
Get it signed."

607
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:03,445
Jump right into my nightmare.

608
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:06,086
So now I can't be honest?

609
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:11,320
- I'd prefer loyalty.
- What'd we say when we got together?

610
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,443
Brutal truth. Remember?

611
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,846
I think you added the "brutal."

612
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:22,484
There's a sensitivity thing that some
people have. I don't have it.

613
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,849
I don't cry at movies,
or gush over babies...

614
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,048
...I don't do Christmas early...

615
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:31,921
...and I don't tell a man who
screwed up our lives:

616
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:35,806
"Oh, poor baby."
That's me, for better or worse.

617
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,849
But I do love you.

618
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,327
- Avery, it's over.
- I didn't hear it.

619
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,887
- Something is missing.
- You've never been alone.

620
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,003
- Listen.
- You can't be alone.

621
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,885
It's over.

622
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,730
No one has ever dumped me.

623
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,087
I'm not trying to make history.

624
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,527
I climbed to the top of El Capitan...

625
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,004
...in 18 hours and 23 minutes.
I can make this work.

626
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,843
No.

627
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,961
Oh, Jerry.

628
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:32,251
I didn't ever want to hurt you.

629
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:47,244
I won't let you hurt me, Jerry.
I'm too strong for you. Loser!

630
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,928
Roll with the punches.
Tomorrow's another day.

631
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:59,125
Taxi!

632
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:02,040
You're loving me now, aren't you?

633
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,445
Very much. Taxi!

634
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,162
Is it my imagination?
Didn't we arrive in a limo?

635
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:14,810
<i>The question is... I hope I don't
sound like a shrink here, but...</i>

636
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:20,567
<i>- ...what's wrong?
- Man, I'm just a big disappointment.</i>

637
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,169
Jerry, everybody cries on this show.

638
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:28,211
If you tested positive,
quit doing blow.

639
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:32,651
Upset about your baby?
Why'd you leave her mother?

640
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,165
I knew her, she's okay.

641
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,486
<i>The media don't understand
the pressures $54 million comes with.</i>

642
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:44,408
- This is some bullshit.
- What are you doing with me, Rod?

643
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:50,246
- What?
- Don't you even see? I'm finished.

644
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,365
I am fucked!

645
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:56,684
Twenty-four hours ago I was hot!

646
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:58,570
Now...

647
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,322
...I'm a cautionary tale.

648
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:07,010
I don't need this jacket,
because I'm cloaked in failure!

649
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,403
I lost him the night before the draft.

650
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,608
Why? Let's recap.

651
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,442
Because a hockey player's kid
made me feel superficial.

652
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,770
I ate some bad pizza, went to bed
and grew a conscience!

653
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:26,450
Well, boo-fucking-hoo!

654
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:31,166
I got a shelf life of 10 years.

655
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:36,645
My next contract has to bring
the dollars that'll last a long time.

656
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,321
I'm done in five years.

657
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:41,961
What's my family gonna live on?

658
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,244
Huh? What you get me.

659
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,408
So I won't hear your shit.

660
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,607
"Oh, I lost Cush and Avery..."

661
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,446
Could I have another drink, please?

662
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,684
Anybody else would have
left you by now...

663
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,288
...but I'm sticking with you.
I said I would.

664
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,366
If I gotta ride your ass,
you gonna show me the money.

665
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,080
You gonna show me the money.

666
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:16,162
We together on this. You know
what I'm saying? We gonna be one.

667
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,885
The both of us! You know?!

668
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,441
Oh, my God.

669
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:30,570
You have no messages.

670
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,327
He's coming. He just lost his
best client. I invited the guy over.

671
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:06,930
This is not a guy. It's a syndrome.
"Early midlife, hanging by a thread...

672
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:12,001
...I can't be alone, I'll call
my long-suffering assistant" syndrome.

673
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:16,649
- But if that's what you want...
- Honey, he's engaged.

674
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,408
And for the first time,
I'm part of something I believe in.

675
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,850
Okay. But he better not
be good-looking!

676
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,769
I'm Jerry Maguire.

677
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:38,688
Hello. You're just the way
I pictured you.

678
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,130
- I'm her disapproving sister, Laurel.
- Honesty.

679
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,927
Thank you.

680
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,966
Thank you. Dorothy!

681
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:56,880
Dorothy, your boss is here.

682
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:58,725
Hello.

683
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,405
Hey, you.

684
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,285
- Thanks for inviting me over.
- Sure.

685
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,002
Where's the little guy?

686
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,089
- He's sleeping.
- Sleeping.

687
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,770
I'm so glad you're home.
That alone thing is not my specialty.

688
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,761
Oh, my God!

689
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,211
Well, I broke up with Avery.

690
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,767
- Gosh, you know, that's too bad.
- No, it's better...

691
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,642
...because we'll still be friends.
It's better now than later.

692
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,327
- I'm dying here, aren't I?
- It's a really bad cut.

693
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,842
Just think if I got her
the ring she really wanted.

694
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,201
Why don't you have a seat?

695
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,885
I'll get some aloe vera for the cut.

696
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,444
- Do you have something to drink?
- Sure.

697
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,727
I heard.

698
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,090
No kidding. I saw the shadow
of curious shoes under the door.

699
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:30,484
He'd go home with a gardening tool
if it showed interest.

700
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,687
Use the frosted glasses.

701
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,689
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

702
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,885
- I warmed up some chicken.
- That's the girl I love!

703
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:44,688
I'll only say this: You've always
been responsible with Ray.

704
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,607
He shouldn't hear
a strange man's voice here.

705
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,811
- Some drunken stranger.
- As opposed to 10 angry women?

706
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,404
Lean forward. Okay, I've got it.

707
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:00,524
It's still edible. Change your shirt.

708
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,044
Hi, Jerry.

709
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:15,761
Hi, Ray. Aren't you
supposed to be in bed?

710
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,240
Yeah.

711
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,370
Don't worry, I won't tell.

712
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,762
The human head weighs eight pounds.

713
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:40,690
- Jerry Maguire.
- I think it's this one.

714
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:48,041
<i>You should dream about me.
I should be on your mind constantly.</i>

715
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:52,404
<i>That's when the dollars will flow.
The kwan will appear.</i>

716
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:56,650
- Who is this?
- Who is this? This is the Rod Tidwell.

717
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,167
I need to speak with my agent.

718
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:02,443
- We should be one.
- You a football player?

719
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:07,244
<i>A football player? I'm a teacher
about to whomp your ass!</i>

720
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,169
Put Jerry on the phone!

721
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,921
You just can't fall
for some drowning man.

722
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,969
- Be practical.
- Practical?

723
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:18,767
Turtleneck, sensible.
V-neck, sexy. Turtleneck.

724
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,807
Don't say that. What are other women
my age doing right now?

725
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:27,368
They're out partying,
trying to get a man.

726
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,650
Trying to keep a man.
Not me, I'm trying to raise a man.

727
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,450
This one. I've got a 24-hour-a-day
reminder of Roger for my whole life.

728
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,123
- I've had three lovers in four years.
- That's not bad.

729
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:47,048
All of them ran a distant second
to a good book and a warm bath.

730
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,450
Look at me. I'm the oldest
26-year-old in the world.

731
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:53,808
- Now, how do I look?
- Good.

732
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,851
Yeah? Thanks.

733
00:58:56,040 --> 00:59:00,489
<i>72% of new buyers are
African-American. That's what I am.</i>

734
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,044
- You talk too much.
- Talking is primitive communication.

735
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:08,642
- It was fun talking to you. Bye.
- Jerry...!

736
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:13,201
<i>- I'll</i> make a ham sandwich.
- I wanna say one thing.

737
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,570
- You do listen to me.
- Well, I love you. Mayo?

738
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,565
...Repression, as a religion.

739
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:24,845
When my daddy retired from
the United Way after 38 years...

740
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:30,087
...he said, "I wish they'd given me
a more comfortable chair."

741
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,970
And then my dad died.

742
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:36,569
My mom took me to the zoo,
and I loved the zoo. And...

743
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:37,926
Wait.

744
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:42,967
- I want to tell you more about my dad.
- No, let's go to the zoo.

745
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,765
You're right.

746
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:52,409
It's just my whole life,
I've been trying to talk.

747
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,081
I mean, really talk.

748
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:59,160
But no one wants to listen.
You know that feeling?

749
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:03,450
- They just look at you...
- Let's go to the zoo, right now.

750
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:08,402
The zoo, you know...
The fucking zoo's closed.

751
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,408
You said "fuck."

752
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,522
Yeah, I did.

753
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,281
- Is that...?
- I won't tell.

754
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,201
Well, then I'm gonna
have to take you to the zoo.

755
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:33,481
- I gotta go to bed, my mom's coming.
- Oh, wait...

756
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:37,530
I hear my mom. I gotta go to bed.

757
01:00:38,040 --> 01:00:40,930
- Thanks for listening.
- Sure.

758
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:47,402
Okay. Drinks, food,
and I called you a cab.

759
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:53,766
- Good idea.
- Quiet, I have a little boy asleep.

760
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,087
Right.

761
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,047
Our company.

762
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:08,241
Look. A little...
A little speech before I go.

763
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:18,407
Do not worry about your future.

764
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:23,687
You and your son,
we, are just fine.

765
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,763
You still have a job.

766
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:31,400
But let me tell you something
about Jerry Maguire, okay?

767
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:35,804
You come after me, and you will lose.

768
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:41,282
No, because I am a survivor.
I'm a survivor!

769
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:47,324
Dorothy Boyd, you are
with the Lord of the Living Room.

770
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,650
The King of the Kingdom!

771
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:53,087
And I am...

772
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,201
...drunk.

773
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,564
We meet again.

774
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:25,087
Here.

775
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:36,685
Truth?

776
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:43,128
- Sure.
- I care about the job, of course.

777
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:46,762
But mostly,
I just want to be inspired.

778
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:52,367
- Me too.
- What you wrote inspired me.

779
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,047
I'm working with you
because of that memo.

780
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,689
I loved that memo.

781
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:08,608
It's a mission statement.

782
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:23,610
Well...

783
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:26,931
Sorry about the hand.

784
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,611
You know that feeling?

785
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:37,566
You're not completely
embarrassed yet...

786
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:41,009
...but you glimpse
tomorrow's embarrassment?

787
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,249
Don't worry about it, boss.

788
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:47,127
Oh, shit. You said "boss."

789
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,767
- Yeah, I did.
- Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.

790
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,443
- No, don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
- I do. I feel like him.

791
01:03:55,680 --> 01:04:00,447
- I'm, like, harassing you right now.
- Well, I may not sue.

792
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:15,647
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

793
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:21,684
Look, don't worry, okay?
I mean, don't...

794
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,681
We'll be okay because
I am gonna take my one client...

795
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:32,005
...and we are gonna go all the way.

796
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:37,287
Because, hey...
I'm back.

797
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,001
Don't worry.

798
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:01,609
- Way to go, Rod. Good catch.
- You can't...

799
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:05,008
All right, good job.

800
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:13,006
- Gotta talk about his contract, Dennis.
- Meet me at The Crocodile, 8:00.

801
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,365
You bet.

802
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:36,686
Thank you.

803
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,646
<i>Tell me you got lost.
I thought I was your friend.</i>

804
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:45,209
- Something came up.
- Okay. $10 <i>million</i> for four years.

805
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:48,529
- You're dreaming.
- Ten for four. It's a deal.

806
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:54,888
- He's got an attitude problem.
- He listens to me. I can help you.

807
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:59,529
- He's a shrimp.
- He broke all the records last year.

808
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,810
I want a prototypical
wide receiver who's 6'3", 220.

809
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,249
<i>Not some guy who's 5'10" and bitches.</i>

810
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,848
Dennis, I'm asking you...

811
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:13,607
...for a favor.

812
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:19,446
<i>I introduced you to your wife.
We've spent Christmases together.</i>

813
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:23,770
- Holiday cheer.
- Jerry, you're reaching.

814
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:28,608
I'm asking for a favor.
Don't do this to me. We have history.

815
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:33,647
We got history, all right.
You drove the prices up for years.

816
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:39,284
- It's your turn at the end of the line.
- Dennis, don't...

817
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,363
I talked with Dennis Wilburn
about your renegotiation.

818
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,006
Talking?

819
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,884
Jerry Rice, Andre Reed, Chris Carter.
I smoked all these fools!

820
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,691
Yet they're making the big dollars.

821
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:08,608
They are making the kwan.
And you're talking.

822
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,800
- Kwan? That's your word?
- Hell yeah, that's my word.

823
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,971
Some dudes might have coin,
but they'll never have kwan.

824
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,286
What is...?

825
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:26,930
It means love, respect, community
and dollars. The entire package.

826
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,121
The kwan.

827
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,406
Great word.

828
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:37,404
- Towel?
- No, I air-dry.

829
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:44,370
Listen, Rod. I say this
with great respect for you.

830
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:49,406
But those players you mentioned
are marquee players.

831
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:55,005
- And this deal where, you know, we...
- Marquee?

832
01:07:55,200 --> 01:07:58,886
This is a renegotiation.
We want more from them.

833
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,527
Show them your pure joy of the game.

834
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,604
Bury the attitude a bit,
and show them...

835
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,205
Wait.

836
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,366
- You're telling me to dance.
- No. I'm saying...

837
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,051
...to get back to the guy
who first started playing.

838
01:08:16,240 --> 01:08:21,201
Way back when you were a kid, it
wasn't just about the money, was it?

839
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:23,485
Was it?

840
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:25,726
Was it?

841
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:31,441
Do your job.
Don't you tell me to dance!

842
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:33,489
- Fine.
- Hey. Hey!

843
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:35,409
I am an athlete.

844
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:38,081
- I am not an entertainer!
- Fine!

845
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:43,730
I do not dance, and I do not start
pre-season without a contract!

846
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:47,926
- Fine, fine, fine!
- Jerry, talk to me.

847
01:08:49,080 --> 01:08:51,845
Breathe! Breathe, Jerry.

848
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:56,766
I am out here for you.

849
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,643
You don't know
what it's like to be me.

850
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:04,970
It is an up-at-dawn,
pride-swallowing siege...

851
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:08,926
...that I will never fully
tell you about, okay?!

852
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,725
God. Help me!

853
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,923
Help me, Rod. Help me help you.

854
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,881
Help me help you.

855
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:26,444
Help me help you.

856
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,010
I'm sorry.

857
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,250
You are hanging on
by a very thin thread.

858
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:43,362
And I dig that about you!

859
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,444
No contract? I'll help me,
I'll help you, help everybody!

860
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,368
- That's my man.
- Hey, I'm happy to entertain you.

861
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,847
Help me! Help me!

862
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:02,809
- See you in Los Angeles.
- Jerry. Come on, man.

863
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:06,010
See, that's the difference between us.

864
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:10,000
You think we're fighting.
I think we're talking.

865
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:18,850
Unless you love everybody,
you can't sell anybody.

866
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,681
Dennis Wilburn is faxing his offer
for Tidwell on Thursday morning.

867
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,726
- He said you'd be happy... Glad.
- He say happy or glad?

868
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,130
Glad. He said glad. Glad.

869
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:47,962
- Glad is good.
- We could sure use that commission.

870
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,165
Here. I did a rundown
on where you stand financially.

871
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:00,327
- My condo was devalued.
- You don't have to explain.

872
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,607
The other night, I wanna apologize.

873
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:06,763
What happened there?

874
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:10,248
We're coworkers.
We can't have atmosphere.

875
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,841
I'm very relieved you said that.

876
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,402
You know, the other night,
I was lonely.

877
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,967
I felt you understood something.

878
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:22,770
We've got a company to think about.

879
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,049
I'll never take advantage
of you again.

880
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:29,603
- Good.
- You walked out on a job for me.

881
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,882
Can this be right?

882
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:34,041
Exactly.

883
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:39,371
I know you need to be alone
with your thoughts.

884
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,689
Think about what's wrong
and how to fix it.

885
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,571
And, you know, just be alone.

886
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,884
Alone.

887
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,521
- You wanna go out to dinner?
- I know a great place.

888
01:11:57,720 --> 01:12:02,248
I broke up with that loser,
and then he started stalking me.

889
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:06,843
- What do you mean by stalking?
- Coming over uninvited.

890
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:12,042
"Coming over uninvited"? So Romeo
on your balcony is a stalker?

891
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:25,161
Excuse me. Ladies?

892
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,248
Good evening,
I'm looking for Dorothy Boyd.

893
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:36,442
- She's in the kitchen.
- Laurel. Hello.

894
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,243
- Where are you taking her tonight?
- You're the nanny?

895
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:45,601
- Au pair.
- Au pair? I see.

896
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,446
He likes you.

897
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:57,163
My goodness.
I've got some gifts for you.

898
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:01,682
Do you like presents?
Good, all right.

899
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:06,365
Arizona Cardinals.
It's the team Rod plays for.

900
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,042
- Dropping your laundry off?
- Want a Steelers hat?

901
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:12,806
- For me?
- I got some things.

902
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,571
- I've got it in gray too.
- Thanks.

903
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,486
You're very welcome.
Look what I've got here.

904
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,002
An energy bar.
It'll keep you up all night.

905
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:27,484
That's not a good idea.
Aunt Laurel will eat that.

906
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:33,165
It looks like you've got a fan.

907
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:39,365
That's more than a dress,
that's an Audrey Hepburn movie.

908
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:43,810
I got revved up at the thought
of an evening among adults.

909
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,004
- No offense, buddy.
- Jerry, you meet Chad?

910
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,522
Am I dressed okay? I didn't realize...

911
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,207
Don't let him stay up too late.

912
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,849
Tonight, I'm gonna teach
Ray about jazz.

913
01:14:02,080 --> 01:14:04,321
That'll put him to sleep early.

914
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:07,883
I want to go too.

915
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,405
No, sweetheart, you stay here
with Chad and be good. Kiss me.

916
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:15,925
Let's go.

917
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,970
- Good night.
- Good night.

918
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,162
Give me a hug.

919
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:07,449
<i>- I'll</i> meet you at the car.
- Okay.

920
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:09,682
You forgot your keys.

921
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:14,124
I've never seen him kiss a man
just like a dad!

922
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:18,969
Wasn't that thrilling?
He must have been needing that.

923
01:15:19,200 --> 01:15:23,683
Don't cry at the start of a date.
Cry at the end, like I do.

924
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:28,128
Don't be a shoulder
for him to cry on either.

925
01:15:28,360 --> 01:15:31,011
- Keys.
- Oh, keys.

926
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,124
Oh, dear.

927
01:15:59,720 --> 01:16:03,520
Ever since you've met me, I've been...

928
01:16:08,440 --> 01:16:12,889
It was laziness, my breakup
with Avery. You know that saying?

929
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:17,768
"It's nobody's fault." It's a lie.
Somebody is always to blame.

930
01:16:17,960 --> 01:16:21,965
You go for it like you do a job.
You work at it.

931
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:26,370
But maybe love shouldn't be
such hard work.

932
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,807
Yeah, maybe so.

933
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:35,847
But it's not every day
you say goodbye to a woman like that.

934
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:41,368
- A song for the lovers?
- No, thank you.

935
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:46,964
- No, no, we work together.
- This is like an office meeting.

936
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,808
But I know what you mean.

937
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,850
It wasn't like my marriage to Roger
was any good, even before...

938
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:00,049
Before...?

939
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,321
- Jerry?
- What?

940
01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:08,369
Let's not tell our sad stories.

941
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,567
I'll be back in just a second, okay?

942
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,646
They sting. Let Chad
catch the bee in the glass.

943
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,880
He won't hurt him. You've got such
a good heart, buddy. I love you.

944
01:18:23,200 --> 01:18:26,568
Well, this would be good night.

945
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,691
Good night.

946
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,410
I'll see you tomorrow.
It's a big day.

947
01:18:58,800 --> 01:18:59,881
Good night.

948
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,090
Good night.

949
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,287
Oops.

950
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:44,811
- Let me fix this.
- Good idea.

951
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,931
I think you should not come in.

952
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,086
Or come in.

953
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:53,446
- Depending on how you feel.
- The same to you.

954
01:20:55,960 --> 01:20:58,201
I have to go in.

955
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,522
I live here.

956
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,970
Right.

957
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,164
I'll come in.

958
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:21,124
Good.

959
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:32,805
Are you sure we want to do this?

960
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,849
Oh, hell, yes.

961
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:51,888
- Did he have a good night?
- Yeah, he's asleep.

962
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:56,165
- How did it go with sport-boy?
- Still going.

963
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,802
All right.

964
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:06,404
How are you?

965
01:22:09,080 --> 01:22:10,525
Treat her right.

966
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:16,809
She's great.

967
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:26,531
I know this might be a bit awkward,
but I want you to use this.

968
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,163
No, look.
God...

969
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,727
This is Miles Davis and John Coltrane.

970
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:38,811
Stockholm 1963.

971
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:43,888
Two masters of freedom, playing
before their art was corrupted...

972
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:46,970
...by cocktail-lounge performers...

973
01:22:47,160 --> 01:22:52,610
...who destroyed the legacy
of the only American art form:

974
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,209
Jazz.

975
01:22:57,640 --> 01:23:00,405
I've put some Mingus on there too.

976
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:13,211
- No barriers, no boundaries.
- Chad, I got it.

977
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,970
Come here.

978
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:10,048
You know this is gonna
change everything.

979
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:14,844
Promise?

980
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,645
What is this music?

981
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:01,486
I love getting up in the morning!
I clap and say:

982
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,489
"This will be a great day!"

983
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:10,251
Great!
Did you really need to do this?

984
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,965
I'm getting him up, so don't worry.

985
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:29,927
What? I'm just waiting for coffee.
I don't care.

986
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,211
- Just tell me one thing.
- No.

987
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:37,881
- Why...?
- I'm worried...

988
01:25:38,080 --> 01:25:43,530
...you'll believe in a guy who may not
have an emotional marble in his head.

989
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,371
- Please, if I start talking...
- You "please."

990
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,803
What am I for taking the opportunity?

991
01:25:50,040 --> 01:25:55,331
- This guy's on the bottom rung.
- Maybe I am taking advantage.

992
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,729
Does that make me a bad person?
Huh?

993
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:04,324
I found someone popular and charming
and not so nice to me, and he died.

994
01:26:04,600 --> 01:26:06,807
Why should I let this guy go...

995
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,767
...when everything in my body
says that this one is the one?

996
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:15,049
Take it easy.
I just wanted a few fun details.

997
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:18,288
Why didn't you say so?

998
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,089
Well, you might be interested
in this one little detail.

999
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,800
I was just about to tell you...

1000
01:26:27,440 --> 01:26:29,761
...that I love him.

1001
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:35,483
I do! I love him,
and I don't care what you think.

1002
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,763
I love him for the man
he wants to be...

1003
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:42,203
...and for the man that he almost is.

1004
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,609
I love him, Laurel. I love him.

1005
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:49,362
- I love him!
- Hi, Jerry.

1006
01:26:51,960 --> 01:26:53,610
Act natural.

1007
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:02,528
- Tell me he's not there.
- He's not there.

1008
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,609
Oh, God.

1009
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:07,923
- Easy, ladies, easy.
- Coffee?

1010
01:27:08,840 --> 01:27:13,164
No, thanks. We bottom-feeders
prefer cereal first.

1011
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:18,362
- Let's have Apple Jacks.
- Apple Jacks it is.

1012
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,724
Good morning, darling.

1013
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:26,641
Morning.

1014
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,567
- What's going on?
- A lot, actually.

1015
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,640
We've got a big fax today.
We need this commission.

1016
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,082
Need this commission. Milk?

1017
01:27:38,440 --> 01:27:40,044
Cheers.

1018
01:27:47,160 --> 01:27:50,289
That was really great
of you this morning.

1019
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:56,366
Let's just root for a big offer
so we can move out of this room...

1020
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,046
...into a real office.

1021
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,971
Would you mind? Thanks a lot.

1022
01:28:10,360 --> 01:28:11,964
Shit.

1023
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,010
1.7 for three years?
Man, we owe more than that!

1024
01:28:22,200 --> 01:28:25,124
This is the game.
I'll get back to them.

1025
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:29,121
And say what? "Please remove
your dick from my ass"?

1026
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:32,688
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little pregnant right now.

1027
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:38,046
- I feel like crying.
- Let's not take this emotionally.

1028
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:42,450
- We'll roll with the problem.
- Why are you so calm?

1029
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:46,326
Roll with this problem?
Don't take it emotionally?

1030
01:28:46,520 --> 01:28:49,922
You haven't gotten emotional
enough over him!

1031
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,084
- Get me Bob Sugar on the phone.
- Marcee...

1032
01:28:55,920 --> 01:29:00,687
- You wanna leave me?
- A lot of agents say a lot of shit.

1033
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,922
What do you stand for?!

1034
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:08,331
How about integrity?
There's so much greed in the world...

1035
01:29:08,520 --> 01:29:11,490
...I don't know what to tell my son!

1036
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:15,002
This guy isn't yelling,
"Show me the money!"

1037
01:29:15,240 --> 01:29:20,246
Do you know he's broke
and working for you for free?

1038
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:24,523
Broke! Broke, broke, broke.

1039
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,688
- I'm not as good at insults as she is.
- That was pretty good.

1040
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:31,849
No shit.

1041
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:35,566
Let me show you something.

1042
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:43,961
- Here. Rod, read this.
- No, no, no, no.

1043
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:48,326
I just think that...
I think it's important.

1044
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:50,961
I appreciate this, but...

1045
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:54,562
You should be proud.
They should read it.

1046
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:00,525
Tell me what to do. Tell me to eat
lima beans, I'll eat lima beans.

1047
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,564
You say this is the best,
all we can get...

1048
01:30:04,760 --> 01:30:08,162
- All we can get?
- I'm talking with my agent.

1049
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:13,810
This is what you're gonna do. You're
gonna reject that shitty contract.

1050
01:30:14,240 --> 01:30:19,690
Play out your existing shitty contract,
and next year, you're a free agent.

1051
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:25,850
Baby, this is us. You and me.
We determine our worth.

1052
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:28,441
You are a strong, proud...

1053
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:32,326
...surviving, splendid black man.

1054
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,325
Marcee...

1055
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,602
...you are the shit.

1056
01:30:42,760 --> 01:30:44,603
On, baby.

1057
01:30:47,160 --> 01:30:52,291
- If you get injured, you get zero.
- Won't happen. I'm strong in mind.

1058
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:00,607
- It's a risk.
- You bet on me, like I bet on you.

1059
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:09,844
You know? My man!

1060
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:15,562
You know, baby?

1061
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,880
- You're so crazy.
- I love you, baby.

1062
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:25,084
- Let me kiss that head.
- Thank you.

1063
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:38,402
- I'm taking that job in San Diego.
- Don't talk about that yet.

1064
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:44,164
- You can't afford me.
<i>- I'll</i> find something fast for Tidwell.

1065
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:48,280
- I refuse to be a drain.
- We'll stay afloat.

1066
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,969
We'll stay afloat. Don't leave.

1067
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:56,960
- Get on the camel.
- You've been on my ass all day.

1068
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,970
- He's my client.
- Get him on the camel.

1069
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,885
- I will.
- We don't need a camel.

1070
01:32:03,120 --> 01:32:07,489
- It's Camel Chevrolet.
- You see that? That's how I feel.

1071
01:32:07,680 --> 01:32:10,684
- He's feeling my pain!
- Get on the camel!

1072
01:32:10,920 --> 01:32:15,847
- I'm pulling him from this.
- It's okay. Just get rid of the camel.

1073
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:19,726
- This isn't what I had in mind.
- You're pulling him?

1074
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:21,809
Right, let's bounce.

1075
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:27,044
Pulling him? Then you shouldn't
have begged me to hire him.

1076
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:32,289
I know you needed that commission,
but we won't get Reebok...

1077
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:35,364
...with no regional Camel ad.
Excuse me.

1078
01:32:35,640 --> 01:32:40,771
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- Are we gonna be friends now?

1079
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,480
What do you know
about single moms?

1080
01:32:43,640 --> 01:32:45,961
I was raised by one.

1081
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:51,570
Tell me. Because after this, she'll
have to take that job in San Diego.

1082
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,084
First of all, single mothers
don't date. Watch yourself.

1083
01:32:56,280 --> 01:33:00,808
They've been to the circus.
You know what I mean?

1084
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,800
They've been to the puppet show
and seen the strings.

1085
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,571
- You love her?
- How do I know?

1086
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:09,967
You know when you know.

1087
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:14,882
I don't want her to go. I've been
hanging out at her place a lot.

1088
01:33:15,080 --> 01:33:19,051
That right there is bullshit!
You gotta be fair to her.

1089
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:23,763
Single mothers are a sacred thing.
You gotta have the talk.

1090
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,606
She loves you. If you don't love her,
you have got to tell her.

1091
01:33:33,560 --> 01:33:37,281
The kid's amazing. He...

1092
01:33:39,680 --> 01:33:42,286
I feel you. I feel you, dog.

1093
01:33:42,480 --> 01:33:47,088
But a real man wouldn't shoplift
the pootie from a single mother.

1094
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:51,363
I didn't shoplift the pootie.

1095
01:33:56,720 --> 01:34:01,089
All right. I shoplifted the pootie.

1096
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:14,847
You know, John Coltrane
once said to Miles Davis...

1097
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,606
When you say goodbye to him, just
be cool. What's meant to be will be.

1098
01:34:20,840 --> 01:34:26,165
You'll see each other. I'm losing
the only person who listens to me.

1099
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:30,001
- Quit making me laugh.
- You're doing the right thing.

1100
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:33,687
Start your life.
Don't cushion the fall for him.

1101
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:37,123
Check out Exhibit A on the front lawn.

1102
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,566
- I'm almost sympathetic to the guy.
- Goodbye.

1103
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,649
All right. Goodbye.

1104
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,290
Bye.

1105
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:59,881
Listen, you're gonna
like it in San Diego.

1106
01:35:04,360 --> 01:35:08,684
It's gonna be great there.
You'll make a lot of friends.

1107
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:14,048
- I'm gonna see you this weekend.
- Go ahead and go.

1108
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,807
Go ahead and go.

1109
01:35:32,640 --> 01:35:36,804
- Sure you're okay to drive this?
- This rig? No problem.

1110
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:42,040
<i>- I'll</i> see you this weekend.
- Get in the car. Get in the car.

1111
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:46,928
I'll see you in a couple of days,
and I love you.

1112
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:50,322
I love you too.

1113
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,843
- What?
- Nothing.

1114
01:35:54,320 --> 01:35:56,368
I'll see you soon.

1115
01:35:57,320 --> 01:36:01,882
Look, if this weekend
should turn into next month...

1116
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:07,484
...and next month turns into whenever,
don't make a joke of your life.

1117
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,843
Go back and read what you wrote.

1118
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:16,450
You're better than the Bob Sugars.
Don't forget that.

1119
01:36:33,720 --> 01:36:37,406
- Wait! Wait a second.
- No, no! Oh, God.

1120
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:44,127
- We can save on medical, rent...
- Don't listen to him.

1121
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:48,086
What if we stay together?
What if we got married?

1122
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:54,890
- If I said that, would you stay?
- Don't do that. Don't say that unless...

1123
01:36:55,120 --> 01:36:58,329
Well, say it if you want to.

1124
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,210
Will you marry me?

1125
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,329
What are you thinking?

1126
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:50,247
We're getting married.

1127
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:56,127
Do you, Jerry Maguire,
take this woman to be your wife?

1128
01:37:56,520 --> 01:37:57,601
Not yet.

1129
01:37:57,800 --> 01:38:03,204
And do you, Dorothy Boyd,
take this man to be your husband?

1130
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,521
Almost.

1131
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:08,246
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1132
01:38:08,520 --> 01:38:10,966
- Okay, sweetie.
- Oh, yeah.

1133
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,809
I should go.

1134
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:57,648
Come on, brother. Talk to me, brother.

1135
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:13,089
We did it.

1136
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:16,204
We sure did.

1137
01:39:35,840 --> 01:39:38,446
You fuck this up, I'll kill you.

1138
01:39:44,920 --> 01:39:47,287
I'm glad we had this talk.

1139
01:39:49,440 --> 01:39:51,568
Oh, look at them.

1140
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:57,084
She is so beautiful.

1141
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:16,288
I do not believe
they have this on tape.

1142
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:19,807
Hey, that's my bro.

1143
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:26,686
See, now I'm gonna
release this to ESPN.

1144
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:33,765
- You think I'm joking.
- No, it's okay. I know where you live.

1145
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,404
You didn't have the talk, did you?

1146
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:43,361
No.

1147
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,963
Well, this definitely
was another way to go.

1148
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:52,842
Hey, Dorothy, come here.

1149
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:56,726
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. and Mrs. Maguire.

1150
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,045
We're gonna have a great season!

1151
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,246
Scotty, Tidwell did four for 36.

1152
01:41:14,440 --> 01:41:16,283
- Jerry.
- Dennis.

1153
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:18,921
- He's having a good game. So far.
- He is.

1154
01:41:19,320 --> 01:41:21,527
You're gonna miss him next year.

1155
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,730
<i>Loser.</i>

1156
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:31,006
<i>I've got a great team behind me
and I'm loving it.</i>

1157
01:41:37,800 --> 01:41:39,529
That's my mo'fo!

1158
01:41:40,960 --> 01:41:42,007
Come here.

1159
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,960
Why don't you be the first man
in your family not to use that word?

1160
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,245
And we'll let you live.
Now go kiss Daddy, quick.

1161
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:57,361
Come on, now!

1162
01:41:58,320 --> 01:42:00,527
Come on, Rod!

1163
01:42:03,760 --> 01:42:06,764
I saw you limping
after the first quarter.

1164
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:08,724
Yeah, I...

1165
01:42:11,120 --> 01:42:15,125
I sprained my ankle on the ice
out there. It was cold.

1166
01:42:15,320 --> 01:42:16,845
All right. Thanks.

1167
01:42:17,040 --> 01:42:21,762
That went well.
Anybody else worth talking to? No.

1168
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:23,724
Let's get out of here.

1169
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,045
- How's your head?
- Bubblicious.

1170
01:42:29,400 --> 01:42:31,528
- How are you?
- Hey, Rod.

1171
01:42:31,720 --> 01:42:34,849
- How you doing, man?
- Hanging in there.

1172
01:42:38,280 --> 01:42:42,604
That quarterback sucks.
He's gonna get me killed.

1173
01:42:42,840 --> 01:42:46,322
He's throwing high
and across the middle.

1174
01:42:46,520 --> 01:42:50,320
My brain's blown because
you weren't asshole enough...

1175
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:53,763
...to get me my 10 million
three months ago.

1176
01:42:56,040 --> 01:43:00,602
Take care of yourself on that field.
You're my entire client roster.

1177
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,010
Don't I know this.
Now go home to your wife.

1178
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:08,204
- What's that mean?
- What are you doing here?

1179
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:12,883
- You could've told me on the phone.
- How about personal attention?

1180
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:16,522
- You don't want to go home.
- What are you saying?

1181
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,129
I'm just trying to talk to you.
How's your marriage?

1182
01:43:21,320 --> 01:43:24,369
The husband and wife thing,
how is that?

1183
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:36,488
- Not everyone has what you have.
- Why did you get married?

1184
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:41,285
- I'm just asking as a friend.
- You want an answer?

1185
01:43:41,560 --> 01:43:43,130
Loyalty-.

1186
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,850
She was loyal.

1187
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:54,803
I mean, you know,
everything grew from there.

1188
01:43:55,240 --> 01:43:57,163
It just...

1189
01:43:58,200 --> 01:43:59,804
...grew from there.

1190
01:44:01,120 --> 01:44:05,250
- That's an answer.
- That's the answer.

1191
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:10,321
It's not sexy. Shit!
But that's an answer.

1192
01:44:10,480 --> 01:44:15,042
"Tell him what he's won, Bob."
"A beautiful marriage!"

1193
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,050
Shit!

1194
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:22,121
Well, I'm happy to entertain you,
as always, Rod.

1195
01:44:25,480 --> 01:44:27,608
I have a question for you.

1196
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:29,842
- Are we really friends?
- Why not?

1197
01:44:30,080 --> 01:44:35,086
Friends can tell each other anything
if we have our friends hats on, right?

1198
01:44:35,280 --> 01:44:36,884
- I think so.
- All right.

1199
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:41,363
Here's why you don't
have your $10 million.

1200
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:46,401
You're a paycheck player. You play
with your head, not your heart.

1201
01:44:46,600 --> 01:44:48,921
In your personal life? Heart.

1202
01:44:49,120 --> 01:44:52,488
On the field,
it's about what you didn't get.

1203
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:55,121
Who's to blame, who underthrew...

1204
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,570
...who has the contract you don't,
who's not giving you love!

1205
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:04,766
That is not what inspires people!
That is not what inspires people!

1206
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:09,010
Just shut up!
Play the game from your heart.

1207
01:45:09,240 --> 01:45:13,529
Then I'll show you the kwan.
And that's the truth!

1208
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:18,647
Can you handle it? It's just
a question from a friend. You know?

1209
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:24,566
When they call you shrimp,
I'm the one who defends you!

1210
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:27,610
- I don't wanna be friends no more.
- Fine.

1211
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,242
Quit using that word "kwan."
That's my word!

1212
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:34,125
<i>- I'll</i> see you in L.A.
- No heart?!

1213
01:45:35,240 --> 01:45:38,050
I'm all heart, motherfucker!

1214
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:20,567
- How many concussions has he had?
- I can't get no respect.

1215
01:46:20,760 --> 01:46:22,728
I'm making miracles happen.

1216
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:45,489
I went to see this so-called
black film the other day.

1217
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,163
No more salt.
Your biggest game is coming up.

1218
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:53,126
I don't want you dehydrated
for Monday <i>Night</i> Football.

1219
01:46:55,240 --> 01:47:00,531
Twenty minutes of coming attractions.
All black films, all violent.

1220
01:47:00,760 --> 01:47:05,926
- Brothers shooting brothers.
- I hate you seeing movies alone.

1221
01:47:06,120 --> 01:47:10,444
- Baby.
- My Pisces queen.

1222
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,526
I hate seeing movies without you.

1223
01:47:18,440 --> 01:47:21,284
I won't do it anymore, okay?

1224
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:33,160
15355;

1225
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,891
- Now?
- Baby now!

1226
01:47:40,520 --> 01:47:44,570
- Ray, it's time to go.
- You got them?

1227
01:47:44,720 --> 01:47:47,564
Do you take Visa? Take it!

1228
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,161
What were you thinking tonight...

1229
01:47:51,400 --> 01:47:56,361
...watching them go through the entire
human emotional experience?

1230
01:47:56,600 --> 01:47:59,570
"I hope he doesn't get injured."

1231
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:03,569
I felt responsible.

1232
01:48:05,240 --> 01:48:09,848
Sometimes I can't tell at all
what's going on in your head.

1233
01:48:15,960 --> 01:48:19,248
And I don't know your noises yet.

1234
01:48:20,080 --> 01:48:25,484
- Well, when you wonder, ask me.
- Okay, I will.

1235
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:29,081
I thought I just did.

1236
01:48:34,240 --> 01:48:37,084
- Why do you love me?
- Why do you love me?

1237
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,243
Can I come and watch TV?

1238
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:43,251
- In just a minute.
- For a few minutes.

1239
01:49:02,600 --> 01:49:04,728
<i>Hang in there.
He's not going anywhere.</i>

1240
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:06,810
I know.

1241
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,161
- Can we talk about something else?
- I don't think so.

1242
01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:16,400
I'm incapable of small talk.
But that's why you love me, right?

1243
01:49:29,800 --> 01:49:33,327
I'm about personal attention.
This is my life.

1244
01:49:33,560 --> 01:49:36,245
I'm available to you 24 hours a day.

1245
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:40,451
I'll <i>be in Phoenix tomorrow
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1246
01:49:40,640 --> 01:49:44,201
I can be in Indiana
by 11:30 Tuesday morning.

1247
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,402
Just give me 20 minutes.

1248
01:49:47,040 --> 01:49:49,964
I'm not asking for an answer now.

1249
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:54,324
I'll call you tomorrow.
Just enjoy your day. Tell Doug hi.

1250
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:58,162
All right, thank you.
Same to you, Marilee.

1251
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:05,201
Indiana, Tuesday. I'll be there.

1252
01:50:09,400 --> 01:50:10,686
It's my fault.

1253
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:14,526
What?

1254
01:50:14,720 --> 01:50:17,690
It's not fair to you,
this whole thing.

1255
01:50:21,400 --> 01:50:22,686
Come here.

1256
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:26,884
Tell me. Let me help.

1257
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:31,211
I took advantage of you.
Worst of all, I'm not alone.

1258
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,971
I did this With a kid.

1259
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:39,286
I was just on some wild ride
where I thought that...

1260
01:50:39,560 --> 01:50:44,248
...I was in love enough
for both of us.

1261
01:50:45,480 --> 01:50:48,245
I pretended your proposal was real...

1262
01:50:48,440 --> 01:50:51,728
...when it might have been
a hypothetical.

1263
01:50:54,280 --> 01:50:56,282
I did this.

1264
01:50:56,720 --> 01:51:00,042
At least I can do something
about it now.

1265
01:51:00,920 --> 01:51:03,605
I'm not a guy who runs.

1266
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:05,644
I stick.

1267
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,883
Well, I don't need you to stick.

1268
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:14,569
What do you want?
My soul or something?

1269
01:51:14,760 --> 01:51:20,164
- Why not? I deserve that.
- What if I'm not built that way?

1270
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,531
- I think we made a mistake.
- What if it's true?

1271
01:51:28,840 --> 01:51:32,208
"Great at friendship,
bad at intimacy."

1272
01:51:32,400 --> 01:51:36,371
It's the theme of my bachelor film,
for God's sake.

1273
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:41,361
I know, I watched it.
I sort of know it by heart.

1274
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:48,208
- I don't like to give up.
- Please.

1275
01:51:49,840 --> 01:51:54,880
My need to make the best of things,
and your need to be responsible...

1276
01:51:55,080 --> 01:51:59,881
If we don't say something about
it now, we could lose 10 years...

1277
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,969
...being polite.

1278
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:08,648
Let's just call this next road trip
what it really is:

1279
01:52:09,840 --> 01:52:12,207
A nice long break.

1280
01:52:20,600 --> 01:52:22,409
What about Ray?

1281
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:28,891
Well, you'll be friends.

1282
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:31,570
Friends?

1283
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:40,609
- Of course you'll be friends.
<i>- I'll</i> take him to the zoo.

1284
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:47,889
So this break is a breakup? That's...

1285
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:52,642
Come on, Jerry.
You know this isn't easy for me.

1286
01:52:53,560 --> 01:52:56,404
On the surface,
everything looks fine.

1287
01:52:57,280 --> 01:53:00,363
I've got this great guy.

1288
01:53:01,200 --> 01:53:04,124
And he loves my kid.

1289
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:09,364
And he sure does like me a lot.

1290
01:53:15,880 --> 01:53:18,724
And I can't live like that.

1291
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:24,564
It's not how I'm built.

1292
01:53:57,160 --> 01:54:01,927
If this is empty,
this doesn't matter.

1293
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,480
It was just a mission statement.

1294
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,648
Put your arms up, please.

1295
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:02,685
Hey, buddy. I wondered
where you were. How's it going?

1296
01:55:02,960 --> 01:55:04,849
Get out of here. Go.

1297
01:55:07,520 --> 01:55:10,922
- Where's your agent?
- I don't know.

1298
01:55:11,480 --> 01:55:16,202
You belong with the big boys.
You belong with the big money.

1299
01:55:16,400 --> 01:55:20,803
- You're fucking Rod Tidwell!
- Get away from my guy.

1300
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:25,130
- I was just telling...
- Just go. Flee.

1301
01:55:25,320 --> 01:55:29,689
This is a nice moment for you.
I'm gonna let you have it.

1302
01:55:31,800 --> 01:55:34,849
Give me a call, Rod.
Say hi to Marcee.

1303
01:55:42,600 --> 01:55:45,444
- Thanks for coming.
- I missed you.

1304
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,766
What can I say?
You're all I've got.

1305
01:55:54,080 --> 01:55:59,530
Frank Gifford with Al Michaels and
Dan Dierdorf at the Sun Devil Stadium.

1306
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:04,288
<i>The story is the Cardinals
are still alive for a playoff spot.</i>

1307
01:56:04,560 --> 01:56:09,248
<i>The reason for that is
the outstanding play of Rod Tidwell.</i>

1308
01:56:09,480 --> 01:56:11,562
<i>We'll talk about that too.</i>

1309
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:15,401
The Dallas Cowboys
know they're in the playoffs.

1310
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:18,649
<i>Going for a consecutive Super Bowl.</i>

1311
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:22,362
If Arizona wins tonight
and next week...

1312
01:56:22,560 --> 01:56:28,010
<i>...they'll make the playoffs
for the first time in 21 years.</i>

1313
01:56:28,720 --> 01:56:32,406
<i>Better not mess up
for Monday Night Football.</i>

1314
01:56:32,960 --> 01:56:37,170
What did I say? He's always
nervous for televised games.

1315
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:42,161
<i>The Cowboys continue their mission
on Monday</i> Night <i>Football.</i>

1316
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:52,087
- Hey, Shannon.
- Hi, good game.

1317
01:56:52,280 --> 01:56:55,409
- Great column this morning.
- Thanks.

1318
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,211
Fuck you, punk!

1319
01:57:09,440 --> 01:57:11,807
It's a real bruiser out there.

1320
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:16,284
<i>The Cardinals refuse to go
quietly into the desert night...</i>

1321
01:57:16,480 --> 01:57:21,327
...as the interminable season winds
down. Just trying to be poetic.

1322
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:23,522
<i>Wax on, AI. Wax on.</i>

1323
01:57:25,680 --> 01:57:27,682
<i>A tough hit on Tidwell.</i>

1324
01:57:27,880 --> 01:57:29,291
Nothing poetic about that.

1325
01:57:29,440 --> 01:57:34,002
<i>- I'd have made that</i> a <i>touchdown.
- That's his sixth catch tonight.</i>

1326
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,044
<i>Split to the right. Swenson looks.</i>

1327
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:39,846
<i>A first down at the 19-yard line.</i>

1328
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:45,444
<i>Another savage hit
across the middle on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1329
01:57:45,640 --> 01:57:48,325
<i>They're working Tidwell, aren't they?</i>

1330
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:53,367
- What does Daddy always say?
- It looks worse than it really is.

1331
01:57:54,160 --> 01:57:56,640
He's gonna kill himself.

1332
01:57:56,840 --> 01:57:58,808
- Be quiet.
- What did I say?

1333
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:02,322
Two minutes to play.
Dallas leading by three.

1334
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:07,048
<i>Second down and one now
at the Dallas 11-yard line.</i>

1335
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:10,722
<i>Swenson backs to pass. A blitz!</i>

1336
01:58:10,920 --> 01:58:13,844
<i>Down he goes!
Sacked for a six-yard loss.</i>

1337
01:58:14,040 --> 01:58:17,283
<i>Good move coming with a blitz
after Swenson.</i>

1338
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:22,321
<i>He had too many men in that pattern.
They couldn't pick up the blitz.</i>

1339
01:58:24,240 --> 01:58:27,369
90 razor, X-out on one, ready?

1340
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:30,724
Here we go!

1341
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,890
<i>He had a chance to get rid of it.</i>

1342
01:58:34,120 --> 01:58:37,442
<i>They've now gone to third and seven.</i>

1343
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:42,686
<i>In the waning moments of this game,
Dallas 17, Arizona 14.</i>

1344
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:47,046
<i>Tidwell in motion.
Moving back to his left now.</i>

1345
01:58:47,240 --> 01:58:52,121
<i>Play fake. Swenson, protected well,
lofts one into the end zone.</i>

1346
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,891
<i>Tidwell! Touchdown, Cardinals!</i>

1347
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:58,801
<i>- Did you see him go up on that ball?
- He held onto it.</i>

1348
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:03,642
<i>He's still down. Tidwell, upside down,
hits the ground hard.</i>

1349
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:08,323
<i>- He maintains control of the football.
- He's hurt too.</i>

1350
01:59:08,520 --> 01:59:10,249
<i>He's not getting up.</i>

1351
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:15,327
<i>- Concerned look on the players' faces.
- Get up,</i> baby.

1352
01:59:16,640 --> 01:59:20,087
<i>The trainer out.
It's Tidwell's ninth catch.</i>

1353
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:23,887
- Oh, my <i>God.
- He gives Arizona the lead.</i>

1354
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:35,971
- Can you hear me?
- Blink! Come on, blink!

1355
01:59:43,480 --> 01:59:47,007
Commercial! Show me
what's wrong with my husband.

1356
01:59:47,280 --> 01:59:50,409
- I said he was too small for the NFL.
- Shut up.

1357
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:55,401
- It's the truth. I'm keeping it real!
- Tee Pee, shut up!

1358
01:59:55,600 --> 02:00:01,004
Can't you be loyal to your brother?
Get the hell out of my house!

1359
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:05,082
Hello? Hold on.
It's Jerry Maguire.

1360
02:00:06,080 --> 02:00:07,445
Punk!

1361
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:13,088
Jerry? Oh, my God,
I am freaking out.

1362
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,851
Marcee, he's unconscious.

1363
02:00:16,040 --> 02:00:20,807
Just stay calm. Keep the lines open,
I will call you back.

1364
02:00:20,960 --> 02:00:23,645
There are good doctors. Stay calm.

1365
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:27,640
You have to tell me something.
I am freaking here.

1366
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:32,482
We gotta stay calm.
Your family needs you to stay calm.

1367
02:00:32,960 --> 02:00:36,931
I know, but my whole life
is this family...

1368
02:00:37,160 --> 02:00:40,209
...and it does not work without him!

1369
02:00:40,920 --> 02:00:45,323
<i>All eyes at Sun Devil Stadium
are focused on Rod Tidwell.</i>

1370
02:00:45,480 --> 02:00:49,371
I am so sorry about
everything I said about your job.

1371
02:00:49,560 --> 02:00:53,326
Just do whatever you can
to get Rod to me, please.

1372
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,844
Just do whatever you can.
Please, Jerry.

1373
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:03,321
<i>At a time like this, you just hope
his family is not watching this.</i>

1374
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:07,723
It could be his neck.
It could be his back.

1375
02:01:11,720 --> 02:01:14,849
Blink, baby! Come on, wake up!

1376
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,127
We love you, Rod!

1377
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:30,882
Can you hear me?

1378
02:01:31,480 --> 02:01:33,209
Can you hear me?

1379
02:01:33,400 --> 02:01:35,880
Do you know where you are?

1380
02:01:36,080 --> 02:01:39,084
<i>The trainer's still trying
to revive him.</i>

1381
02:01:39,280 --> 02:01:41,647
We'd love to see some movement.

1382
02:01:41,880 --> 02:01:45,123
- Rod?
- Let's get him off the field.

1383
02:01:45,400 --> 02:01:48,483
- No.
- Get the gurney. Get him off the field.

1384
02:01:48,680 --> 02:01:53,402
Wait, wait. Just let me
enjoy this for a minute.

1385
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:57,969
<i>We're looking for some movement.
Is that his head coming up?</i>

1386
02:01:58,720 --> 02:02:00,768
<i>He's trying to get UP-</i>

1387
02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:04,050
<i>He is getting up.</i>

1388
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:15,689
Look at him! Oh, Mommy, he's okay.

1389
02:02:19,680 --> 02:02:22,570
<i>The whole stadium is standing.</i>

1390
02:02:22,760 --> 02:02:25,445
He's up on his feet
and the crowd loves it.

1391
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:59,244
Here's a guy who's normally very
truculent with the media, aloof...

1392
02:03:14,680 --> 02:03:18,241
<i>- We're happy for you.
- He'll get a flag on this.</i>

1393
02:03:18,480 --> 02:03:20,289
<i>Who cares!</i>

1394
02:03:35,720 --> 02:03:38,803
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Helluva game.

1395
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,723
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1396
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,127
<i>You are gonna pay.</i>

1397
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:55,045
I know. I know.

1398
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:16,962
Where's Jerry?

1399
02:04:36,840 --> 02:04:38,649
You did it.

1400
02:04:39,040 --> 02:04:40,724
You did.

1401
02:04:42,440 --> 02:04:45,569
Why don't we have
that kind of relationship?

1402
02:04:54,440 --> 02:04:56,807
Is that your porty or mine?

1403
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,570
Dorothy?

1404
02:05:02,840 --> 02:05:05,969
Marcee. No, he's right here.

1405
02:05:06,200 --> 02:05:09,921
It's Marcee. She couldn't
get through on your phone.

1406
02:05:12,280 --> 02:05:16,842
We did it. I love you.
I love you so much!

1407
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,282
I love you!

1408
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:31,688
I love you, Tyson.
I love you, baby.

1409
02:05:31,880 --> 02:05:34,531
How's the baby? How's Katie?

1410
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:38,130
Oh, I love you so much.

1411
02:05:39,640 --> 02:05:42,883
You know ain't nothing
gonna happen to me.

1412
02:05:51,240 --> 02:05:56,246
The problem is, like you were
saying earlier, the biorhythms.

1413
02:05:57,680 --> 02:06:00,809
I was saying
the neural pathways are set.

1414
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:05,847
That's why it's hard
for people to change.

1415
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:14,208
I'm sorry, these stupid holidays
make me feel more divorced.

1416
02:06:14,640 --> 02:06:19,362
You know? With the songs,
the constant chocolate-eating...

1417
02:06:35,360 --> 02:06:38,364
I have a confession to make.

1418
02:06:38,840 --> 02:06:43,721
I've listened to you all
tell a thousand sob stories.

1419
02:06:43,920 --> 02:06:46,321
I've been very judgmental.

1420
02:06:46,520 --> 02:06:50,809
Maybe you're all correct.
Men are the enemy.

1421
02:06:51,040 --> 02:06:54,601
No, they're not the enemy.

1422
02:06:54,840 --> 02:06:58,208
But I still love the enemy.

1423
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:13,366
Hello.

1424
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:18,207
I'm looking for my wife.

1425
02:07:30,720 --> 02:07:31,881
Wait.

1426
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:46,768
If this is where it has to happen,
then it's where it happens.

1427
02:07:47,880 --> 02:07:52,807
I'm not letting you get rid of me.
How about that?

1428
02:07:58,360 --> 02:08:02,570
This used to be my specialty.
I was good in a living room.

1429
02:08:02,760 --> 02:08:04,410
I'd do it alone.

1430
02:08:05,160 --> 02:08:07,208
And now, I just...

1431
02:08:13,280 --> 02:08:14,691
I don't know.

1432
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:22,009
But tonight...

1433
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:28,290
...our little project, our company
had a very big night.

1434
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:33,044
A very, very big night.

1435
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,048
But it wasn't complete.

1436
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:46,169
It wasn't nearly close to being
in the same vicinity as complete...

1437
02:08:46,640 --> 02:08:49,325
...because I couldn't
share it with you.

1438
02:08:50,640 --> 02:08:52,688
I couldn't hear your voice...

1439
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:57,651
...or laugh about it with you.

1440
02:09:00,040 --> 02:09:03,203
I missed my... I missed my wife.

1441
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:24,771
We live in a cynical world.
A cynical world.

1442
02:09:25,240 --> 02:09:29,962
And we work in a business
of tough competitors.

1443
02:09:39,640 --> 02:09:41,449
I love you.

1444
02:09:41,680 --> 02:09:43,125
You...

1445
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:46,644
...complete me.

1446
02:09:48,080 --> 02:09:50,162
- And I just...
- Shut up.

1447
02:09:51,520 --> 02:09:53,124
Just shut up.

1448
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:56,042
You had me at "hello."

1449
02:09:57,240 --> 02:09:59,607
You had me at "hello."

1450
02:10:12,160 --> 02:10:14,891
This is my best discussion group.

1451
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:19,802
Your father leaves home on Christmas
Eve, abandoning your family.

1452
02:10:20,040 --> 02:10:24,489
Your mother had to sweep up
at the prison to pay your tuition.

1453
02:10:24,920 --> 02:10:28,288
Your brother lost a leg
in a fishing accident.

1454
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:32,565
You've had a list of horrific
things happen in your life.

1455
02:10:32,800 --> 02:10:36,441
- I'm not gonna cry, Roy.
- I've got some good news.

1456
02:10:36,680 --> 02:10:39,570
I've just been handed a signed memo.

1457
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:43,970
It's a contract.
Arizona Cardinals. Four years.

1458
02:10:44,160 --> 02:10:49,326
$11.2 million and you'll play
in your home state, where it started.

1459
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:51,488
What do you think of that?

1460
02:11:11,560 --> 02:11:16,202
I love everybody.
I love my wife! Marcee!

1461
02:11:17,440 --> 02:11:21,570
I love my kids!
Tyson and my new baby, Katie.

1462
02:11:21,760 --> 02:11:26,891
My older brother, who got one leg,
and my younger brother, Tee Pee.

1463
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:30,846
You're militant, but I ain't
mad at you. I love you.

1464
02:11:31,040 --> 02:11:34,169
I love my teammates.
I'm omitting someone.

1465
02:11:34,480 --> 02:11:39,691
- We only have a half-hour show.
- I send love to my offensive line.

1466
02:11:40,680 --> 02:11:44,890
Nice to see you. Congratulations.
Good for you.

1467
02:11:45,560 --> 02:11:48,769
You remember Troy
from the Super Bowl?

1468
02:11:48,960 --> 02:11:50,007
We met in '93.

1469
02:11:50,160 --> 02:11:53,482
- That's right. I enjoyed your memo.
- Thank you.

1470
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:58,846
- A little slow but you come around.
- We're out of time.

1471
02:11:59,040 --> 02:12:01,008
I'm forgetting somebody.

1472
02:12:02,680 --> 02:12:04,728
Jerry Maguire...

1473
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:07,209
...my agent.

1474
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:13,529
You are my ambassador of kwan, man.

1475
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:19,085
Thank you. Congratulations.
We'll be right back.

1476
02:12:22,920 --> 02:12:27,448
- How did you like the zoo, buddy?
- It was great!

1477
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:29,722
One, two, three.

1478
02:12:33,240 --> 02:12:35,447
Hey, kid, throw the ball.

1479
02:12:45,600 --> 02:12:46,931
Good throw, man.

1480
02:12:49,960 --> 02:12:51,644
Did you see?

1481
02:12:52,280 --> 02:12:54,965
Oh, no. Let's go.

1482
02:12:55,400 --> 02:13:00,406
What? I'm not saying we'll throw him
into the major leagues tomorrow...

1483
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:03,410
...but he's got natural talent.

1484
02:13:03,600 --> 02:13:08,128
I know the right people
that'll help develop his talent.

1485
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:24,169
Hey, I don't have all the answers.

1486
02:13:24,400 --> 02:13:29,850
In life, to be honest, I've failed
as much as I've succeeded.

1487
02:13:30,160 --> 02:13:33,721
But I love my wife,
I love my life...

1488
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:36,764
...and I wish you my kind of success.
