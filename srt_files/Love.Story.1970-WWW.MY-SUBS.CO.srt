1
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,053
What can you say
about a 25-year-old girl who died?

2
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,891
That she was beautiful and brilliant?

3
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,645
That she loved Mozart and Bach?

4
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,231
The Beatles?

5
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:09,193
And me?

6
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:28,462
Do you have
The Waning of the Middle Ages?

7
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,963
You have your own library, preppie.

8
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,965
Would you answer my question, please?

9
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:33,884
Would you answer mine first?

10
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,470
Look, we're allowed to use
the Radcliffe Library.

11
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:39,556
I am not talking legality, preppie.
I'm talking ethics.

12
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,767
I mean, Harvard's got
five million books,

13
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,644
and Radcliffe's got
a few lousy thousand.

14
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,814
All I want is one. I've got
an hour exam tomorrow, damn it.

15
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,149
Please watch your
profanity, preppie.

16
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,071
What makes you so sure
I went to prep school?

17
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,907
You look stupid and rich.

18
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:58,951
Actually, I'm smart and poor.

19
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,080
- I'm smart and poor.
- What makes you so smart?

20
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,374
I wouldn't go for coffee with you.

21
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:09,545
- Well, I wouldn't ask you.
- Well, that's what makes you stupid.

22
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,676
Comp. Lit. 105, not bad.

23
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,304
Music 150, not bad.

24
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,975
Music 201.
That's a graduate course.

25
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,769
- Renaissance Polyphony.
- What's polyphony?

26
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:27,563
Nothing sexual, preppie.

27
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:31,567
Look, Miss Cavalleri,
I told you, my name Is Oliver.

28
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,902
- First or last?
- First.

29
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,156
- Oliver what?
- Barrett.

30
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,908
Barrett like the poet?

31
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:41,785
Yeah. No relation.

32
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,331
- Barrett like the hall?
- Yes.

33
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,959
Hey, I'm having coffee
with a real Harvard building.

34
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,836
- You're Barrett Hall.
- No, I'm not Barrett Hall.

35
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,881
My great-grandfather happened
to give the thing to Harvard.

36
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:56,884
So his not-so-great grandson
would be able to get in.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,803
If you're so convinced
I'm a loser,

38
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,347
Why did you bulldoze me
into buying you coffee?

39
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,435
I like your body.

40
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,321
- I major in Social Studies.
- It doesn't show.

41
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:18,906
It's an honors program.

42
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,575
Listen, preppie, I know
you've got at least a few brains.

43
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,035
Really?

44
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,704
Yeah. You're hung up on me, aren't you?

45
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,086
- Jenny!
- Yeah?

46
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,839
Listen, you conceited Radcliffe bitch,

47
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,841
Friday night's the
Dartmouth hockey game.

48
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,135
- So?
- So I want you to come.

49
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,889
Why the hell should I want to go
to a lousy hockey game?

50
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:48,727
- Because I'm playing.
- For which side?

51
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:30,143
Two minutes, number seven. Holding.

52
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,233
Barrett, two minutes, holding.

53
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,996
Why are you sitting here when
all your friends are out there playing?

54
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,415
- I'm in the penalty box.
- What?

55
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,834
- The penalty box.
- What did you do wrong?

56
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,586
- I tried too hard.
- Is that a big disgrace?

57
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,339
- Come on, I'm trying to concentrate.
- On what?

58
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,466
How I'm going to total
that Dartmouth bastard!

59
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,971
- Come on, Arthur, let's go!
- Are you a dirty player?

60
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,390
Would you ever total me?

61
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,142
Yeah, I will right now
if you don't shut up.

62
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,686
I'm leaving. Good-bye.

63
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:26,158
Barrett's back in the game.
Harvard's at full strength.

64
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,126
Go, team, go!
Go, team, go!

65
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:03,862
Harvard goal.
Hackman on the assist, Barrett.

66
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:07,949
- So now I've seen a hockey game.
- What'd you like best?

67
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,578
- When you were on your ass.
- Thanks for coming.

68
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,747
- Did I say you could?
- What?

69
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,291
- Kiss me.
- I was carried away.

70
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,126
I wasn't.

71
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,174
Jenny, I may not call you
for a few months.

72
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,842
- Why?
- Then again, I might call you

73
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,012
- as soon as I get back to my room.
- Bastard.

74
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:32,099
See, you dish it out,
but you can't take it.

75
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,983
- Hello, animals.
- Hey, Ollie.

76
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,903
- What'd you get tonight, Ollie?
- An assist on the last goal.

77
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,947
Off Cavalleri?

78
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,533
- None of your business.
- I'm your roommate!

79
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,077
- Who's this?
- Hey, hey, Barrett got a new goody?

80
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,746
- Yeah, Jenny Cavalleri.
- Who?

81
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,165
Some music type
from Rhode Island somewhere.

82
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,334
Yeah, I know the one.
Real tight-ass.

83
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,421
Yeah, plays piano for The Bach society.

84
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,297
What does she play with Barrett?

85
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,425
Probably hard-to-get.

86
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:09,302
- Simpson.
- Yeah?

87
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,096
Up yours.

88
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,598
That proves it.

89
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,951
Hello, Jen?

90
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,454
What would you say if I told you...

91
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,040
...I think I'm in love with you?

92
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,501
Never say love if you
don't really mean it.

93
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,503
What makes you think I don't mean it?

94
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:47,591
- You're a known quantity, Barrett.
- Meaning?

95
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,384
You're known for quantity.

96
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,512
I mean at Radcliffe,
every hall is Barrett Hall.

97
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,266
You've been checking up
on me, haven't you?

98
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:59,269
I don't dine outdoors
with just anybody.

99
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:05,150
- Am I just anybody?
- What do you think, preppie?

100
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,908
Listen, you're going to have to
fend for yourself this weekend.

101
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,038
See, I'm going to be mixing it up
with Francis Lapierre.

102
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,667
- Very funny.
- Are you jealous?

103
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:26,463
Francis Lapierre is the captain
of the Cornell hockey team.

104
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,091
Oh, you've been
reading the sports page, huh?

105
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,726
You know, I wouldn't mind watching you
play hockey with Cornell this weekend.

106
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,147
No. I'll be involved.

107
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:46,900
Oh, yeah. The All-Ivy title.

108
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:57,619
- More than the All-Ivy title?
- Hell of a lot more.

109
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,043
Cornell goal, Cashay.

110
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,796
Score tied, 3-3.

111
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,096
Come on, Barrett!
Break it up!

112
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,607
I'll kick your ass
all the way back to Montreal.

113
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,942
Break it up! Come on!

114
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,486
All right! Break it up, you guys!

115
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,282
Come on! Get up!

116
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,911
You're out of the game, Barrett!
Come on!

117
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,960
I'll break yours
before you break mine!

118
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,920
Come on, Barrett!
Get off the ice.

119
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,714
Get off the ice!

120
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:57,846
- You chicken-shit!
- You Montreal faggots!

121
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,601
What are you talking about?
Lapierre started the fight!

122
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,936
- Get in there!
- Oh, come on!

123
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,564
Five minutes
for number seven. Fight.

124
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:13,153
Penalty, Barrett of Harvard,
five minutes for fighting.

125
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,937
Probably want a steak, son.

126
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,981
Thank you, father,
but the doctor took care of it.

127
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,776
I meant for your stomach, Oliver.

128
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,738
I think I'm supposed
to eat with the team, sir.

129
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,282
Oh, well, that's fine.

130
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:45,245
- Does your face hurt?
- No, sir.

131
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,333
I'd like Jack Wells
to take a look at it Monday.

132
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:53,545
- It's not necessary, sir.
- Jack's a specialist, you know.

133
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,505
It's not... nothing special.

134
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,801
My car's over there.
Can I give you a lift somewhere?

135
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,594
I'll walk you to your car.

136
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,724
Tell me, Oliver, have you
heard from the law school?

137
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:10,353
Father, I haven't... I haven't exactly
decided on the law school.

138
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,274
I was merely asking whether
the law school had decided on you.

139
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,737
- No, sir.
- There really isn't any doubt.

140
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,488
About what, sir?

141
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,866
The law school needs good men like you.

142
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:28,288
- They haven't got a hockey team.
- You have other qualities, Oliver.

143
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,793
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way up here to see Harvard lose.

144
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,129
I came to see you play.

145
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,968
You know, Oliver, the dean
of the law school is an old classmate...

146
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:44,304
That's very nice, sir.

147
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,477
- Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye, sir.

148
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,359
- Give my best to mother.
- Yes, I will.

149
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,552
Briggs Hall. Sandy Davidson!

150
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,264
- Jennifer Cavalleri.
- You have a call on two.

151
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,892
- She's in the downstairs phone booth.
- Where is that?

152
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,977
Around the corner.

153
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,231
Briggs Hall.

154
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,316
Would you please,
would you please...

155
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,944
For god's sake, Phil!

156
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,614
Yes. Yeah, yeah.

157
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,950
For the million and oneth time, yeah.

158
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,785
Absolutely.

159
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,955
Oh, I love you, too, Phil.

160
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,790
Yeah. I love you, too.

161
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,501
Good-bye.

162
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:58,795
Hi.

163
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,005
Hey, what happened to you?
You look terrible.

164
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,465
I'm injured.

165
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:05,677
Did you at least make
the other guy look worse?

166
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,387
I always make the other guy look worse.

167
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,933
- Jenny...
- Yeah?

168
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:15,520
- Who's Phil?
- My father.

169
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,025
You call your father Phil?

170
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:23,570
That's his name.
What do you call your father?

171
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,739
- Son of a bitch.
- To his face?

172
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,993
- I never see his face.
- Why? Does he wear a mask?

173
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:33,580
- In a way.
- Come on, he must be proud as hell.

174
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,958
- Here you are, this big Harvard jock.
- So was he.

175
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,586
Bigger than All-Ivy?

176
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:43,006
He rowed single sculls
in the 1928 Olympics.

177
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,967
- Oh. Did he win?
- No.

178
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,261
Then why is he a son of a bitch?

179
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:51,973
Because he leans on me.
Because he makes me do the right things.

180
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,808
What's wrong with
doing the right things?

181
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,935
I don't like to be programmed
in the Barrett tradition.

182
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:59,647
I don't like to have to put out
"X" amount of achievement every term.

183
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:03,026
Yeah, I've noticed you hate
making dean's list and being All-Ivy.

184
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,778
What I hate is that he expects no less,
and when I do come through,

185
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:08,740
He's so incredibly
blasé and indifferent.

186
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,701
- That's ridiculous.
- You know all he said after the game?

187
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,495
He went all the way up
to Ithaca to watch you play hockey?

188
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,247
After we blew the title

189
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:20,627
and after I was nearly massacred
by the wild Canadian hordes,

190
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:23,296
do you know what the big banker
Harvard man said to his son?

191
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,923
Hordes in Ithaca?

192
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,926
"You know, Oliver, the dean of
the law school was a classmate of mine."

193
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,387
What did you expect him to say?
"How's your sex life?"

194
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,266
- Whose side are you on, Jenny?
- I didn't know it was a war.

195
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:38,728
You don't understand.

196
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:41,689
Oh, I think I understand
quite a bit more than you wish I did.

197
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,983
Did your father...
Excuse me...

198
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,235
Did the son of a bitch
at least get lousy grades?

199
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:50,198
- He was a Rhodes Scholar.
- I think I notice a little problem

200
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:51,991
of overachievement
in the Barrett family.

201
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,285
Listen. let's forget about it.
There's no problem, OK?

202
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:58,373
- Right. No problem.
- Hey, do I call my father on the phone?

203
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,084
Do I bill and coo and say,
"I love you, Phil?"

204
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,170
- No.
- There you are.

205
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,923
- And do you know why?
- Why?

206
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,258
Because his name is Oliver.

207
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:15,515
The great Barrett Hall. Don't you
at least salute when you pass it?

208
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,726
Ugliest building on campus.
Do you know I've never even been inside?

209
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,269
Now, that's a very mature attitude.

210
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,398
It's not easy to live with history
staring you in the face.

211
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,150
How many people do you know
have to cope with a Barrett Hall?

212
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,697
- Well, I could name two.
- Thanks.

213
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,211
Cavalleri, I've got
nothing against music,

214
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,088
but must you play it while we study?

215
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:51,300
I'm studying the music, preppie.
It's called Analysis of Form.

216
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,927
Yeah.

217
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,805
You're going to flunk out if you
just sit there watching me study.

218
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,932
I'm not watching you study.
I'm studying.

219
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,393
Bullshit. You're looking at my legs.

220
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,311
Listen, Cavalleri,
you're not that great-looking.

221
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,814
I know, but can I help it
if you think so?

222
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,400
Let's change
the subject, huh?

223
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,277
I wasn't aware that
there was a subject.

224
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:12,280
You're under the mistaken impression
that I wanted to make love to you.

225
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,365
- Was I?
- But I'm not interested.

226
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,659
Definitely. Not interested.

227
00:17:16,827 --> 00:17:19,037
Good. At least we've got
one thing in common.

228
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,457
Look, Cavalleri, I know your game,
and I'm tired of playing it.

229
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,752
You are the supreme Radcliffe smart-ass.

230
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,379
The best.
You put down anything in pants.

231
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,841
But verbal volleyball
is not my idea of a relationship.

232
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:34,177
And if that's what
you think it's all about,

233
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:37,513
why don't you just go back to
your music wonks, and good luck.

234
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,309
See, I think you're scared.

235
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:45,688
You put up a big, glass wall
to keep from getting hurt,

236
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:48,524
but it also keeps you
from getting touched.

237
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,528
It's a risk, isn't it, Jenny?

238
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,451
At least I had the guts
to admit what I felt.

239
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,582
Someday, you're gonna have to come up
with the courage to admit you care.

240
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,588
I care.

241
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,939
Do you think your priest
would like this?

242
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,567
I don't have one.

243
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,445
Aren't you a good Catholic girl?

244
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,241
Well, I'm a girl...

245
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,120
And I'm good, right?

246
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,749
So, that's two out of three.

247
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,713
- Why do you wear it?
- It was my mother's.

248
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,466
- Why'd you leave?
- What?

249
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,136
Why'd you leave the Church?

250
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:44,682
I don't know.
I never really joined.

251
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,394
I mean, I guess I never thought

252
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,063
there was another world
better than this one.

253
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:56,068
I mean, what could be
better than Mozart...

254
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,905
Or Bach...

255
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,657
Or you?

256
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,411
Jenny?

257
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,583
I'm up there with Bach and Mozart?

258
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,421
And The Beatles.

259
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,517
Hey, Simpson, let me
sack on your couch.

260
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,062
- How come?
- Barrett.

261
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,815
- Who's the guest of honor?
- Cavalleri.

262
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,277
Again? Still?
Barrett's slipping.

263
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,215
It's amazing.

264
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,930
I'm studying.
I'm really studying.

265
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,975
I'm studying.

266
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,686
Sorry. Sorry.

267
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,277
Oliver?

268
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,199
I love you.

269
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,516
I can't believe
how great you were.

270
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,518
Yeah, that tells me how much
you know about music.

271
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,020
I know enough.

272
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:44,690
Wise up, would you please, Barrett?
I was not great. I was not even All-Ivy.

273
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,901
I was just OK, OK?

274
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,612
OK.

275
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,989
But I mean, you should
always keep at it.

276
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:54,241
Who said I'm not gonna
keep at it, for God's sake?

277
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,828
I'm going to study
with Nadia Boulanger, aren't I?

278
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,580
Who?

279
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,875
Next year.
I have a scholarship in Paris.

280
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,170
Paris?

281
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,506
Yeah. I've never been to Europe.
I can hardly wait.

282
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,800
Hey. How long have you
known about this?

283
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,845
Come on, Ollie, don't be stupid,
would you please? It's inevitable.

284
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,263
What is?

285
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,265
That we're gonna graduate
and go our separate ways,

286
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:19,725
and that you're going
to go on to law school.

287
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:21,644
What are you talking about?

288
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,647
You're a preppie millionaire,
and I'm a social zero.

289
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,982
What does that have to do
with going our separate ways?

290
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,026
We're together now, aren't we?
We're happy.

291
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:33,614
Look, Harvard is like this big Santa
Claus bag stuffed full of crazy toys,

292
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,700
- but when the holiday's over...
- This has been more than a holiday.

293
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,327
You've got to go back
where you belong.

294
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,247
You're going back to Cranston,
Rhode Island, to bake cookies?

295
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,207
Pastries! And don't
make fun of my father.

296
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,376
Then don't leave me, Jenny!

297
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,549
Please.

298
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,011
Yeah, but what about my scholarship,
and what about Paris,

299
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,930
that I've never seen
in my whole goddamn life?

300
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:00,182
And what about our marriage?

301
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,101
Who said anything about marriage?

302
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,396
I'm saying it now.

303
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,190
You want to marry me?

304
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:14,572
- Yeah.
- Why?

305
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:22,663
Because.

306
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,544
That's a good reason.

307
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,690
- You're driving like a maniac.
- This is Boston.

308
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,859
Everybody drives like a maniac.

309
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,695
You're gonna kill us
before your parents can murder us.

310
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,156
Jenny, my parents
are gonna fall in love with you.

311
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:01,118
- Even the son of a bitch?
- Of course. Absolutely.

312
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,621
Hey, where's the old
Radcliffe confidence?

313
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,832
- Back at Radcliffe.
- It's going to be OK, Jenny.

314
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:11,754
- What did you say on the phone?
- Just that I'd drop in to visit.

315
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,215
- Very casual, huh?
- Yeah, right.

316
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,551
How often do you visit
during the term?

317
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:22,681
- Never.
- Oh, that's casual.

318
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,215
Holy shit!

319
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:04,890
Hey, stop, Oliver.
No kidding. Stop the car.

320
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,151
I didn't think
it would be like this.

321
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:20,155
- Like what?
- I mean, like, this rich.

322
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,658
This is too much for me.

323
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,703
Don't worry, Jenny. It'll be a breeze.

324
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,831
Yeah, but why is it that
I suddenly wish my name

325
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,584
were Abigail Adams
or Wendy Wasp?

326
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:39,550
- Don't be scared.
- Aren't you?

327
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,136
No.

328
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,282
- So far, so good.
- That's not saying much.

329
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,618
- Your hand is cold.
- So is yours.

330
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,328
Let's get away from here
while we still got a chance.

331
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:11,373
Master Oliver! Hello!

332
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,792
Hello, Florence. This is Jenny.

333
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,588
Master? I always knew you had slaves.

334
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,844
Let me take your wrap.

335
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,139
Your parents are in the drawing room.

336
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,352
Thank you, Florence.

337
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,484
Wow, I see half the buildings
of Harvard hanging on that wall.

338
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,652
Oh, it's nothing.

339
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,364
Hey, you didn't tell me you were
related to the Sewell Boathouse.

340
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,910
Yes, I come from a long line
of wood and stone.

341
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,005
Hello there!

342
00:30:02,091 --> 00:30:04,593
I'd like you to meet
Jennifer Calaveri.

343
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:08,639
- Cavalleri.
- As in Cavalleria Rusticana?

344
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,391
- Right. No relation.
- Hello, Mom.

345
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,352
Hello, darling.

346
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,271
So nice to meet you.
How are you, son?

347
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,858
Fine. Fine, sir. Fine.

348
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,487
Please sit down
and make yourself at home.

349
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:39,837
We'll have to be going soon.

350
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,090
Why are you so uncomfortable
with your parents?

351
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,967
What gave you that impression?

352
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,135
Why did you want to leave
the minute we got there?

353
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,012
Because I didn't like the way
they were treating you.

354
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,180
Like what?

355
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,266
"What is it your parents
are in, Jennifer?"

356
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:54,351
What is it your people
are in, Jennifer?

357
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,228
My father bakes cookies.

358
00:30:56,396 --> 00:31:00,357
- Oh? What's the name of his firm?
- Phil's Bake Shop.

359
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:04,987
- Of Cranston, Rhode Island.
- How interesting.

360
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,281
So your people come
from Cranston, Jenny.

361
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:10,534
Well, mostly. Actually, my mother
came from Fall River.

362
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,870
The Barretts have mills in Fall River.

363
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,706
Where they exploited
the New England poor for generations.

364
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,918
- In the 19th century.
- When you inherit, Oliver,

365
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,129
you can give all our money
back as reparations.

366
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,841
Well, that's exactly what the
philosopher, Saint-Simon advocated.

367
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,218
In the 18th century.

368
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,973
- It's getting late.
- For what?

369
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,641
But you're staying
for dinner, aren't you?

370
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,352
- Yes.
- No. I've got to get back.

371
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,355
Nonsense. You're staying
for dinner, and that's an order.

372
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,526
Everything is an order,
a directive, a command.

373
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,362
Where is your sense of humor?

374
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:51,199
You know, when I was in school,
he used to send me memos. Memos!

375
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,744
I mean, don't you find that rather odd?

376
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,954
I find it rather cute.

377
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,709
Tell me, Oliver,
have you heard from law school?

378
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,629
No, sir, not yet.

379
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,881
He'll get in. Who've they got
better than Oliver?

380
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,509
I quite agree. He's bound
to be graduated with honors.

381
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:11,637
Oliver has always
done well in school.

382
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,180
Even at Exeter, he was the very...

383
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,933
Mother, it doesn't mean a thing.
There are a lot of guys trying

384
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,310
to get into law school.
I just happen to be one of them.

385
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:22,773
- I could give Price Zimmerman a ring...
- No!

386
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,942
I mean, please don't, sir.

387
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,111
Merely to find out if he knows.

388
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,906
I want to get my letter
with everyone else, please.

389
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:36,036
He was only trying to be helpful.

390
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,165
But, Jenny,
I don't need that kind of help.

391
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,251
- OK.
- No, it's not OK!

392
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,546
He's not going to be satisfied
till he cuts them off.

393
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:48,757
What?

394
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,218
What you wouldn't like
to be cut off.

395
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,056
Oh... Well, we've got
to take care of those.

396
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,893
- Take care, you two!
- Drive with caution, Oliver.

397
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,187
Get there a minute later,
but get there.

398
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,279
You really like
to bug your father, don't you?

399
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,782
The feeling's mutual,
or haven't you noticed?

400
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,536
I mean, I didn't think you'd stop at
anything just to get to your old man.

401
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,622
It's impossible to get
to Oliver Barrett III.

402
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:26,712
Unless maybe...
if you marry Jennifer Cavalleri?

403
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:36,722
- Is that what you think?
- Yes, I think it's part of it.

404
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,183
Jenny, you don't believe I love you?

405
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,312
Yes, but in a crazy sort of way,
I think you also love

406
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,898
- my negative social status.
- No!

407
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:52,154
Listen, I can't pass judgment, Oliver.
I just think so.

408
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:55,949
I mean... I know
that I love not only you,

409
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,702
but your name and your numeral.

410
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,538
After all, it's part of what you are.

411
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,917
- Oh, how can you do it?
- What?

412
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,213
How can you see me and still love me?

413
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,925
That's what it's about, preppie.

414
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:47,542
- How are you, son?
- Oh, I'm OK. OK, sir.

415
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:53,256
- Did you hear from law school?
- Yes. I called you, remember?

416
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:55,675
Oh, yes, yes. Congratulations.

417
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,303
You'll be the first Barrett
on the Supreme Court.

418
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,514
Oh, I may just chase
ambulances instead.

419
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,517
Yes, fine. How's Raymond?

420
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:06,812
He's fine. Got into OCS.

421
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,897
Army?

422
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,109
- That's good.
- That's bad.

423
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:18,782
- You haven't mentioned Jennifer.
- What's there to say?

424
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,077
You're presenting us
with a fait accompli, are you not?

425
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,123
- But what did you think?
- I think she's absolutely charming,

426
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,292
And I think for a girl
from her background

427
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,129
- to get all the way to Radcliffe is...
- Get to the point.

428
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,173
The point doesn't concern
the young lady. It concerns you.

429
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:38,385
Your rebellion.

430
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,762
- And you are rebelling, Oliver.
- I fail...

431
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:45,392
I fail to see how marrying
a beautiful and brilliant

432
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:49,146
Radcliffe girl constitutes rebellion.

433
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,189
I mean, she's not
some crazy hippie.

434
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,109
She's not many things.

435
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,905
What irks you most, Father?
That she's Catholic or that she's poor?

436
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:02,325
- What attracts you most?
- I'm leaving.

437
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,911
Don't go off half-cocked, damn it!

438
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,874
I would only ask that you...
wait a bit.

439
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,378
- Define "bit."
- Finish law school.

440
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,922
If this thing is real,
it will stand the test of time.

441
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,384
It is real, but I don't see why
I have to put it to some arbitrary test.

442
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,179
- Because I'm asking you to.
- You're commanding me!

443
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:28,810
Oliver, if you marry her now,
I'll not give you the time of day.

444
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,731
Father, you don't know the time of day.

445
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,885
We're... looking forward
to having you with us next year.

446
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:06,348
Me, too, Dean Thompson.
Something's come up.

447
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:11,269
- Not a change of heart, I hope.
- No, I'm still set on law school,

448
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:15,106
But... I'm going to need
a scholarship.

449
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,528
- Really?
- That's why I'm here.

450
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:25,784
That's... Well, that's rather curious,
considering your background.

451
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,997
- I'm not his son anymore.
- I beg your pardon?

452
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,920
We have had a...
a misunderstanding.

453
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,047
It's a parting of the ways.

454
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:44,219
This is...
very unfortunate, Mr. Barrett.

455
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,638
I am not exactly jumping for joy.

456
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:51,768
Yet... we have many entering students
in far worse straits than you.

457
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,312
What's worse than
the straits of destitution?

458
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,148
Dean Thompson,
I'm getting married next month.

459
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,276
Now, we're both going
to work all summer,

460
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,321
and then Jenny's going to take
a job in a private school, teaching.

461
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,075
That's a living, but it's not tuition.
Your tuition is pretty steep.

462
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,786
Yes.

463
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,207
Dean Thompson, I need a scholarship.

464
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,501
Now, I'm a Harvard magna,
and I've already been accepted.

465
00:38:16,669 --> 00:38:21,047
- I don't have any money in the bank.
- You have a millionaire father.

466
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,383
Had, dean, had.

467
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,886
Why should I be penalized because
I was once related to a rich man?

468
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:32,225
Mr. Barrett, I really
don't think that this office

469
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:34,894
should enter into a...
family quarrel?

470
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:37,314
A rather distressing one, at that.

471
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:40,483
I see. Thank you.

472
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,697
Perhaps... at midyear...

473
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,910
Thank you. You've been
very generous with your time.

474
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,170
We just passed
my junior high school!

475
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,922
Jenny, I can't believe
he liked my instant poverty.

476
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,843
He did, I swear. I mean, at least now
you've got something in common.

477
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:10,430
God, when I first
told him Oliver Barrett...

478
00:39:10,598 --> 00:39:12,349
Yeah? Yeah?

479
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,059
I mean, he just couldn't believe it.

480
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:17,187
He kept reminding me
of the 11th Commandment.

481
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:20,940
- Eleventh?
- "Do not bullshit thy father."

482
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:24,569
Any other commandments
I ought to know about?

483
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:26,321
Yeah. "Stay loose."

484
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,680
- So, is he for it? Does he approve?
- What do you think?

485
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,517
I won't allow it!
I will not allow it!

486
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:57,602
- Do you get me?
- You're tilting at windmills, Phil!

487
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,563
Will you stop referring
to his father as a windmill?

488
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,358
He's a distinguished citizen of Boston,
who I'm gonna call up...

489
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,402
- Mr. Cavalleri...
- Phil. My name is Phil.

490
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,029
I'm gonna call his goddamn father.
I'll go to Boston, even!

491
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,240
It's not gonna do any good, goddamn it!

492
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,118
Would you please not use
profanity in this house, Jennifer?

493
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,953
- You do.
- What the hell is he gonna think?

494
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,955
He's gonna think
you've lost your marbles.

495
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,208
Why, because I won't allow
a parent to reject a child?

496
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:23,002
- Mr. Cavalleri...
- Phil.

497
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,258
- Phil.
- Phil, sir... I reject him, too.

498
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:30,135
Now, don't talk like that, Oliver.

499
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,054
A father's love is something
to cherish and respect.

500
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:36,474
- It's a rare thing.
- Especially in my family.

501
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,476
Let's get him on the phone.

502
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,855
No, you see, my father
and I have installed this cold line.

503
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,983
He'll thaw, Oliver.
He'll thaw, and he'll melt.

504
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:47,193
Believe me, when
it's time to go to church...

505
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:49,279
Come on, let's
get him on the phone.

506
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,824
- Wait. Phil.
- What?

507
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,286
About the church bit.

508
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,414
Well, we're kind of negative on it.

509
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:07,130
Well, I... I didn't necessarily
mean the Catholic Church.

510
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,631
I...

511
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,137
You... you know that
Jennifer is Catholic.

512
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,431
She may have told you that.

513
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:21,436
And her... sainted mother
always dreamed of a...

514
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:25,356
Well, the whole mass
rigmarole, but you're...

515
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,236
Well, God would
bless this union in any church.

516
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:33,114
- Phil...
- Yeah.

517
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,825
- About the God bit.
- Yeah?

518
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,369
Well, we're sort of
negative about that, too.

519
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:40,121
About God?

520
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,668
- About anybody's god?
- See...

521
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,046
We neither one of us believe...

522
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,758
- And we won't be hypocrites.
- Well...

523
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,510
Well...

524
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,846
If that's what you wish,

525
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,474
Just tell me who performs the wedding.

526
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,351
We do.

527
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,106
You mean, do-it-yourself?

528
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,280
That's... that's wonderful.

529
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:20,119
I know I'm...
I mean, that's...

530
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,373
Just... just wonderful.

531
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:30,213
Do it yourself, huh?
I think that's...

532
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,714
...just wonderful.

533
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,554
But... tell me. Is it...
What's the word?

534
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,140
- You mean legal?
- Legal. Is that it? Is it?

535
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:45,520
Yes. I mean... one
of the college chaplains just sort of...

536
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,649
No, I mean
he sort of presides over it,

537
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,318
and then the man and the woman
address each other.

538
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,070
You mean the bride speaks, too?

539
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:00,493
- It's a new world, Philip.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

540
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,122
It's... it's new, all right.

541
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,346
- You two ready?
- Amen.

542
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,308
They haven't started yet.

543
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,143
- Friends...
- How would I know?

544
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,395
I've never been
to a do-it-yourself.

545
00:43:27,563 --> 00:43:30,273
Let us listen to the words,
which they have chosen to read

546
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,859
- on this sacred occasion.
- Amen.

547
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,696
He said "sacred." The priest.

548
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,200
- He's not a priest.
- He is to me.

549
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:56,007
When our two souls
stand up erect and strong,

550
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,176
face to face,

551
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,054
silent, drawing nigh and nigher,

552
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:05,183
until the lengthening wings break
into fire at either curved point...

553
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,935
...what bitter wrong
can the earth do to us

554
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:10,813
that we should not long
be here contented?

555
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:15,568
Think. In mounting higher,
the angels would press on us

556
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,238
and aspire to drop some
golden orb of perfect song

557
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,366
into our deep, dear silence.

558
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,828
Let us stay, rather, on earth beloved,

559
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:29,040
Where the unfit,
contrarious moods of men

560
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:30,833
recoil away...

561
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:33,795
...and isolate pure spirits,

562
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:37,715
and permit a place to stand
and love in for a day,

563
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,635
with darkness
and the death-hour rounding it.

564
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,597
I give you my hand.

565
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,936
I give you my love,
more precious than money.

566
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:55,274
I give you myself,
before preaching or law.

567
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,820
Will you give me yourself?

568
00:45:00,614 --> 00:45:02,657
Will you come travel with me?

569
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:07,203
Shall we stick by each other
as long as we live?

570
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,880
I, Oliver Barrett,
take you, Jennifer Cavalleri,

571
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,592
to be my wedded wife
from this day forward...

572
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:27,557
...to love and to cherish,
till death do us part.

573
00:45:28,976 --> 00:45:32,562
I, Jennifer Cavalleri,
take you, Oliver Barrett,

574
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,941
as my wedded husband,
from this day forward,

575
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,528
to love and to cherish,
till death do us part.

576
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:57,503
By the authority vested in me
by the commonwealth of Massachusetts,

577
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:59,797
I pronounce you man and wife.

578
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,680
So now I'm being kept by a woman.

579
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,183
- You won't like it.
- I already do.

580
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:13,853
Oliver, the Shady Lane School
is only paying me three thou a year.

581
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:16,439
- Why?
- Because my goddamn name

582
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,026
- is Mrs. Barrett.
- Well, couldn't you be Ms. Cavalleri?

583
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,696
If I was Ms. Cavalleri,
I'd be the queen of Paris.

584
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:28,117
- I tell you, it's a great bargain.
- Oliver, four rooms for $82.50 a month

585
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,870
is absolutely impossible
this side of Mongolia.

586
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,915
But this is the Mongolian
section of Cambridge.

587
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,887
I have to admit that it's...
even worse than I expected.

588
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,766
- Yeah, but it's home.
- Yeah.

589
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:55,311
- Well?
- Well what?

590
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,063
There's the threshold.
Carry me over it.

591
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:59,649
Oh, come on, you don't believe
in that sort of nonsense, do you?

592
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,609
Carry me, and I'll tell you later.

593
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,569
You know, we're almost
at the top floor?

594
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,572
OK, I'll be a young
and beautiful divorcée.

595
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:11,494
Hey, what is this, Barrett?
Oh, what is this?

596
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:13,704
I'll tell you after we cross
the threshold.

597
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:20,920
- OK?
- This is not a threshold.

598
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,421
Well, I see our name by the bell.

599
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,507
Look, it's not an official
goddamn threshold.

600
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,467
Now, upstairs, you preppie.

601
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,391
Why are you so heavy?

602
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,476
Did you ever think
I might be pregnant?

603
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,104
- Are you?
- Scared you, didn't I?

604
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:41,023
- No, I...
- Don't bullshit me.

605
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,485
Well, yeah,
for a second, I clutched.

606
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:47,738
- Now, is this the official threshold?
- What do you think?

607
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:51,200
- I think if you don't say yes, I'll...
- Yes! Yes!

608
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:58,142
- Hey, is there a Barrett in the house?
- Hey, where are the kids?

609
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,353
Asleep, thank God!

610
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,689
It's siesta time. I've got 45 minutes.

611
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:05,900
That's more than they give me.

612
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:21,207
Oh, damn it. I don't know
what's wrong with this engine.

613
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,585
- You're a Harvard magna.
- Not in mechanics.

614
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:27,964
- Welcome to the world, preppie.
- Listen, Cavalleri...

615
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:32,510
- The name's Barrett, Barrett.
- Sometimes you are really a bitch.

616
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:44,271
- How are they treating you?
- Fine, except for the Rittenhouse brat.

617
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:47,066
You know, I swear he'll be breaking
and entering before he's ten.

618
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,777
- Oh, yeah? What now?
- He tried to pinch me.

619
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,864
- I don't blame him.
- Next time he does,

620
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,033
- I'm going to wallop him.
- Jesus, no!

621
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,827
Not until you get his parents' tip.

622
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:02,373
Damn it.

623
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:08,838
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- Hey, don't touch me, Oliver.

624
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,132
What a thing to say
to your husband.

625
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,259
Wash, and you can
touch me afterwards.

626
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:17,596
- I will.
- Hey, I had another salary hassle today

627
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,057
with Ms. Anne Miller Whitman.

628
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:22,226
Well, I hope you
laid it on thick this time.

629
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,645
I told her how very proud I was
to be a member

630
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:27,606
of the faculty
of the Shady Lane School.

631
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:31,694
I said, "You know, Ms. Whitman,
even Barretts have to pay their rent."

632
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:35,239
- To which, she retorted?
- "Ho, Ho, Ho."

633
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,702
Define "Ho, Ho, Ho."

634
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,954
Thirty-five hundred for the year.

635
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,915
- That's ridiculous!
- How would you like to support me

636
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:48,294
while I take the courses necessary
to teach in public school?

637
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,674
Would you please say something?

638
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,676
Ho, ho, ho.

639
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,433
I thought you were gonna call
when the meeting broke.

640
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:48,020
Yeah, but I wanted you to study.
Did you have anything to eat?

641
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,523
- I waited for you.
- But you're a growing boy.

642
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,901
- Not anymore.
- Yes, you are, in mind.

643
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,071
- Did you check the mail?
- Just one second, Jenny.

644
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,948
This is a crucial precedent.

645
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:10,709
- Did you check the mail?
- No, I didn't. Anything vital?

646
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:14,213
- We are cordially invited...
- To pay the light bill.

647
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,675
...to a dinner.

648
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:20,594
Your father's 60th birthday.

649
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:26,392
- Did you hear me?
- Yes.

650
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:30,688
- RSVP.
- You even have to ask?

651
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,731
Oliver, I think it's about time.

652
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,942
- For what?
- You know very well what.

653
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,027
Does he have to crawl here
on his hands and knees?

654
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:38,529
- Negative.
- He's reaching out to you.

655
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,072
My mother addressed it.

656
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:45,077
Oliver, think. Sixty years old.
Nothing says he's still gonna be around

657
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,829
when you're finally ready
for a reconciliation.

658
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,747
There's not going
to be a reconciliation.

659
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,125
Someday when you're
being bugged by Oliver V...

660
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,420
- He won't be Oliver V!
- He can be Bozo the Clown,

661
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:57,256
and he'll still going to resent you
because you were a Harvard jock!

662
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,800
by the time he's a freshman, you'll
probably be on the Supreme Court.

663
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,802
- He won't resent me!
- Why not?

664
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,304
Because...

665
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,808
Your father loves you, too, Oliver,
just the way you're gonna love Bozo,

666
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,686
but you Barretts are
so goddamn proud and competitive

667
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,980
that you'll go through your whole life
thinking you hate each other.

668
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:14,899
- If it weren't for you!
- Yes!

669
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,359
The case is closed!

670
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,366
There's still the matter
of the RSVP.

671
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,703
I think you can handle it.

672
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,457
In my whole life, I have never
deliberately hurt anyone,

673
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:33,125
and I just don't think I could.

674
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:37,463
Jennifer... just answer "no."

675
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:42,051
OK, what's the number?

676
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,969
Can't you just write a note?

677
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:47,139
In a few minutes, I'm gonna
lose my nerve. What is the number?

678
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:51,227
338-3434, and dial one first.

679
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,620
Good evening.
This is Jennifer Barrett.

680
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,415
Oh, Mr. Barrett.
Good evening, sir.

681
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:16,085
Fine, thank you.

682
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,129
Yes, we did.
That's why I'm calling.

683
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,049
I'm terribly sorry, sir. I mean...

684
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:26,595
We're terribly sorry,
but no, we can't.

685
00:54:28,556 --> 00:54:30,224
I'm sorry.

686
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:34,937
Oliver, please talk to him.
Just say hello.

687
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,859
- I will never talk to him.
- Please, can't you just do it for me?

688
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:44,196
I've never asked you
to do anything in my whole life.

689
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,534
- Please, Oliver, just for me.
- No.

690
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,872
You're a heartless bastard.

691
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,920
Mr. Barrett, Oliver
would like you to know

692
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:03,924
that in his own special way,
he loves you very much.

693
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:07,136
Just get the hell out of my life!

694
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,443
I forgot my key.

695
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:56,114
Jenny, I... I'm sorry.

696
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,034
Don't.

697
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,829
Love means never
having to say you're sorry.

698
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,771
Paul, would you pay
more attention to blending

699
01:02:14,939 --> 01:02:17,107
and a little less to showing us
your beautiful voice?

700
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,985
- But I wasn't!
- Yes, you were.

701
01:02:20,903 --> 01:02:23,321
Paul, don't bullshit me.
You were showing off.

702
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:25,991
- Sorry, Jenny.
- OK, one last time,

703
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:28,493
And this time, I want crisp diction.

704
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:21,379
That was really,
incredibly, absolutely...

705
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:25,342
-...not bad.
- Oh, Jenny, come on!

706
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,261
- Come on, Jenny!
- Oh, come on.

707
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:31,932
- Tomorrow at 8:30 sharp, OK?
- I'll see you tomorrow at 8:30.

708
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:35,268
- Bye, Jenny.
- Bye, Jenny.

709
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,395
- See you.
- Bye, Jenny.

710
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:53,453
Well, Barrett,
what brings you to church?

711
01:03:54,622 --> 01:03:56,456
The saloons closed early.

712
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:00,961
Did you get us a tree?

713
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:05,465
Don't worry about it,
we'll get one on the way home.

714
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,805
What are you doing New Year's Eve?

715
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:15,725
Sleeping.

716
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,732
I thought you wanted
to spend it with me.

717
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:28,113
- What are you doing?
- Sleeping.

718
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:37,956
Someday we're going
to look back on these days.

719
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,959
The sooner, the better.

720
01:04:47,341 --> 01:04:50,594
Keep running!
Go! Really run! Come on!

721
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:54,264
Keep going!
Come on! Come on!

722
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:57,142
- Come on, Dan. Come on.
- Hey, Jennifer, Come here!

723
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,477
I'm with children.
Can't it wait?

724
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:02,606
Jennifer, I said come here.

725
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:04,983
What? Come on!

726
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,068
Start it over again.

727
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:08,778
What the hell is it?

728
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:11,239
I've got something important
I want to tell you.

729
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,991
Couldn't you just
tell me over there?

730
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:16,536
- No, I want to be alone with you.
- OK.

731
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:18,622
Fantastic news. Here, read.

732
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,668
Harvard Law School?
You got kicked out.

733
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,588
Read it, will you please?
It's great news.

734
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,175
- You were first in the class?
- Not quite.

735
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:34,054
- Third.
- Only third, huh?

736
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:37,307
Hey, but that means
I make the law review.

737
01:05:40,061 --> 01:05:42,312
Well, say something,
will you, please?

738
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:46,316
Not until I've met
numbers one and two.

739
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:04,834
And the William de Jersey
Memorial Award

740
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:09,464
for the finest senior essay,
to Oliver Barrett IV.

741
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,146
The family of Mark Howells...

742
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:29,025
- On your feet.
- How much?

743
01:06:29,193 --> 01:06:32,904
- Five hundred big ones.
- Holy sh...

744
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,614
Get up.

745
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:38,868
- Quiet!
- Come on, come on.

746
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:45,542
The Jennifer Barrett Maternity award.

747
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:04,728
Well, it was a good apartment
for 80 bucks.

748
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:06,938
Yeah, now our garage
will cost that much.

749
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,774
I don't see why you'll
need your car in New York.

750
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:11,443
House calls, Jenny.

751
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:15,530
Come on, fancy lawyers for Jonas
and Marsh don't make house calls.

752
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,283
They do to the houses
of Mr. Jonas and Mr. Marsh.

753
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,287
- They are both close enough to walk.
- Jenny, rich people ride.

754
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:25,498
- Nouveau riche people.
- That's us.

755
01:07:26,208 --> 01:07:27,959
- Hey, Jenny, you won't laugh.
- What?

756
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,962
I'm actually getting
to like the name Bozo.

757
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:33,465
- For what?
- For our kid, damn it.

758
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:37,635
- Our huge and bruising All-Ivy tackle.
- Bozo Barrett?

759
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:40,388
Jen, it's the name
of a real Harvard super jock.

760
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:44,976
You would actually call our
soon-to-be-conceived offspring "Bozo?"

761
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:47,228
Only if he's a boy.

762
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:02,410
We have finally crossed
the poverty line.

763
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:04,204
- Not quite.
- What do you mean?

764
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,414
Not till you carry me
over the goddamn threshold.

765
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:08,208
Again? I thought
we had run that gamut.

766
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,835
Yeah, but you weren't
a lawyer, so it wasn't legal.

767
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:14,255
- We live on the 10th floor!
- You can carry me in the elevator.

768
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,049
Thank God for that.

769
01:08:18,010 --> 01:08:19,511
Can I help you folks?

770
01:08:19,678 --> 01:08:21,805
Barrett. 10-H.
We've got bags in the car.

771
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,098
Is the lady all right?

772
01:08:23,265 --> 01:08:25,308
I will be when he
carries me over the threshold.

773
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:28,686
- I see, newlyweds, huh?
- Eternally.

774
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,731
Move your ass, preppie.

775
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,618
You've got it made,
you bastard.

776
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:46,121
Made in the shade.

777
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,500
Snug as a bug in a rug.

778
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,627
Cut the crap and play.

779
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:56,506
Working for Jonas and Marsh,
pulling in the coin.

780
01:08:56,674 --> 01:08:59,300
- Play, damn it.
- I can't help it.

781
01:09:02,721 --> 01:09:05,598
Married to foul-mouth angel-face.

782
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:07,934
Pay attention, will you?

783
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:12,438
- Why should you have all the luck?
- Hey, man, it was a long, hard drag.

784
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,399
This is the first week
in our entire marriage

785
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:17,026
that Jenny hasn't had to work.

786
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,736
So, what's she going to do?

787
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:22,198
Well, I want her to study at Julliard,
and she wants to have a baby,

788
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:25,451
- So?
- So we're making babies.

789
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,373
Do you need any help, old buddy?

790
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,750
I'll call you if I need you.

791
01:10:02,406 --> 01:10:07,619
- Do you know whose fault it is?
- I wouldn't use the word fault, Oliver.

792
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:12,081
OK, we'll put it your way.

793
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:16,169
Two 24-year-olds
can't seem to make a baby.

794
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,213
Obviously, one of us is malfunctioning.

795
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:21,090
- Who?
- Jenny.

796
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:26,221
All right, then, we'll adopt kids.

797
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:30,058
Oliver, the problem's
more serious than that.

798
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,976
Jenny is very sick.

799
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,356
Define "very sick."

800
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,485
She's dying.

801
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:49,244
That's impossible.

802
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,913
I'm sorry to have to tell you this.

803
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:56,292
That's impossible.

804
01:10:58,545 --> 01:11:01,464
Well, it's a mistake.
It has to be.

805
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:03,883
We've repeated her
blood test three times.

806
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:06,344
There's no question about the diagnosis.

807
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,848
She'll have to be told soon.

808
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:15,144
We can withhold treatment
for a little while, but not for long.

809
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:20,650
We'll have to begin therapy
sometime during the next few weeks.

810
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,695
She's only 24.

811
01:11:28,867 --> 01:11:31,494
- Will it be painful?
- Hopefully not.

812
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:34,247
You'll of course want to speak
to a hematologist.

813
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,375
I can refer you to Dr. Addison.

814
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:41,087
Yeah.

815
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:46,551
What do I do?
What can I do for Jenny?

816
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,846
Act as normal as possible...

817
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:52,598
...for as long as possible.

818
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:56,394
That's really the best thing.

819
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,565
Normal.

820
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,154
Normal. OK, I'll be as normal as hell.

821
01:13:35,077 --> 01:13:36,411
Jen?

822
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:40,873
Jenny, I'm home.

823
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:44,919
- Hey, I need a lawyer.
- I'm a lawyer.

824
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,840
- I need you.
- I need you, too.

825
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,342
Why? I'm not a lawyer.

826
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,720
No, but you're a nut,
and I happen to need a nut.

827
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:59,559
- You look lovely, Jenny.
- Bullshit.

828
01:14:00,227 --> 01:14:03,688
- OK. OK, you look terrible.
- No, I do not look terrible.

829
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:07,150
I never look terrible.
I look OK for Thursday evening, OK?

830
01:14:07,317 --> 01:14:10,695
- There's no poetry in OK.
- Screw poetry, Oliver.

831
01:14:10,863 --> 01:14:14,657
- Just tell me what you see.
- I see you.

832
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,201
That's poetry.

833
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,787
Hey, Dr. Shapeley
said we both checked out.

834
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:23,207
- That's what he told you, too, right?
- Yeah.

835
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,003
So we just have to keep trying, right?

836
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:32,049
- Yeah. Let's try now.
- Right this very minute?

837
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:35,011
Even sooner.

838
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:58,159
Jenny?

839
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:00,995
Jenny! Jenny!

840
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:03,831
Get up, you lazy preppie,
would you please,

841
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:08,127
and get out and support me in the manner
to which I plan to become accustomed.

842
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:10,087
Come on. Get up.

843
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,551
- You meeting Stratton today?
- Who?

844
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:20,348
Ray Stratton, your best friend.
Your roommate before me.

845
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:25,019
Yeah. We're supposed to play,
but I think I'll cancel it.

846
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:28,064
- The hell you will.
- Why not?

847
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:31,359
Listen, I don't want a flabby husband.
Stay in shape, would you, please?

848
01:15:31,527 --> 01:15:33,486
All right, but I'll
take you out to dinner.

849
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:34,987
Why?

850
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:38,741
What do you mean, why? Can't I take my
goddamn wife out to dinner if I want to?

851
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:41,202
OK, Barrett. Who is she?
What's her name?

852
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,746
What?

853
01:15:43,914 --> 01:15:46,374
If you have to take your wife to dinner
in the middle of the week,

854
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,084
you must be screwing somebody.

855
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:09,105
- Hey, what's the matter, Ollie?
- Off day, that's all.

856
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:12,942
Off day? You've been having
an off day for two weeks now.

857
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:16,362
Old man Jonas wanted me to go
to Chicago on a big case.

858
01:16:16,530 --> 01:16:17,822
Oh, yeah?

859
01:16:19,074 --> 01:16:21,826
You know that newscaster
that got beat up by the cops?

860
01:16:21,994 --> 01:16:25,705
Fantastic. You on the other side
of a punch-out rap.

861
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:28,040
- I turned him down.
- Why?

862
01:16:29,001 --> 01:16:32,253
I don't know. I just
couldn't see living in some hotel.

863
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:35,298
Boy, you're really married.

864
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,010
Your time will come.

865
01:17:40,155 --> 01:17:43,366
- Hey, Mrs. Barrett.
- I'm in the kitchen, where I belong.

866
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:46,285
- Get the hell in here, preppie.
- Mrs. Barrett, guess what?

867
01:17:47,287 --> 01:17:50,539
- You got fired.
- I got fired up, and guess where to.

868
01:17:51,750 --> 01:17:53,626
- Reno, Nevada.
- Paris, France.

869
01:17:53,794 --> 01:17:55,795
We'll be there Christmas Day.

870
01:17:57,589 --> 01:17:59,507
No, that's not the way
we're gonna do it.

871
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:03,636
- Do what?
- I don't want Paris.

872
01:18:03,804 --> 01:18:06,806
I don't need Paris.
I just want you.

873
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:09,850
Well, that you've got, baby.

874
01:18:11,645 --> 01:18:14,689
And I want time,
which you can't give me.

875
01:18:21,154 --> 01:18:22,822
You saw Dr. Shapeley?

876
01:18:24,908 --> 01:18:28,452
And his buddy, too.
He's a very nice guy.

877
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:33,958
- Who?
- Dr. Addison.

878
01:18:34,126 --> 01:18:36,836
He's a Yalie. College and med school.

879
01:18:37,462 --> 01:18:38,963
But I said you wouldn't mind.

880
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:43,259
No, not if he's a nice guy.

881
01:18:43,427 --> 01:18:47,096
He's a nice guy, all right. He didn't
bullshit me, and that's what I wanted.

882
01:18:50,726 --> 01:18:55,604
- OK, then, for the Yalie doctor.
- OK.

883
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:11,454
I'm counting on you to be strong,
you goddamn hockey jock.

884
01:19:13,665 --> 01:19:16,709
I will, baby. I will.

885
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,757
No. I mean for Phil.
It's going to be hardest on him.

886
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,720
You, after all,
You're going to be the merry widower.

887
01:19:31,725 --> 01:19:34,727
- I won't be merry.
- Yes, you will be.

888
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,645
I want you to be merry.

889
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:39,523
You'll be merry, OK?

890
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:47,072
OK.

891
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:20,541
- Enough?
- Not for me.

892
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,751
I love watching you
dodge and weave.

893
01:21:22,919 --> 01:21:27,006
- The old hockey fake-out.
- I know, that's you all right,

894
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:28,757
the old hockey fake-out.

895
01:21:28,925 --> 01:21:30,843
Can we get a cup
of hot chocolate?

896
01:21:31,011 --> 01:21:34,597
- Sure. I'll even pay.
- Very gracious of you.

897
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:38,142
I told you I liked it best
when I supported you.

898
01:21:39,185 --> 01:21:43,480
You always supported me.
I mean, after all, what's money?

899
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,317
I don't know.

900
01:21:54,326 --> 01:21:56,619
- Hey, could we afford a taxi?
- Sure.

901
01:21:56,786 --> 01:21:58,245
Where do you want to go?

902
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:01,999
The hospital.

903
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:34,299
She's getting white cells and platelets,
which, at the moment,

904
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:36,844
is the most
important thing she needs.

905
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:39,430
She doesn't want
antimetabolites at all.

906
01:23:39,597 --> 01:23:41,056
What does that mean?

907
01:23:41,224 --> 01:23:44,435
That's a treatment
that slows cell destruction,

908
01:23:44,602 --> 01:23:46,895
but there are
unpleasant side effects.

909
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,356
Jenny's the boss.
Whatever she wants.

910
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,611
You fellows do everything you can to
make sure it doesn't hurt. Everything.

911
01:23:54,779 --> 01:23:57,948
- You can be sure of that.
- I don't care what it costs.

912
01:23:58,116 --> 01:24:00,534
- It could take weeks and months.
- Screw the cost.

913
01:24:01,619 --> 01:24:05,581
I was saying that there's no way
of knowing how long she'll linger.

914
01:24:06,207 --> 01:24:08,375
I want her to have
the very best.

915
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:12,880
I'm wealthy.
I'm rich, really.

916
01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:15,591
Really, I'm like a millionaire.

917
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:57,049
- How have you been, Oliver?
- Fine, sir.

918
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:01,261
- And how is Jennifer?
- She's fine, sir.

919
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:09,770
I need to borrow $5,000
for a very good reason.

920
01:25:14,984 --> 01:25:16,485
Well?

921
01:25:18,404 --> 01:25:21,740
- Sir?
- May I know the reason?

922
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:26,078
I can't tell you.
Just lend me the money, please.

923
01:25:27,664 --> 01:25:29,456
Don't they pay you
at Jonas and Marsh?

924
01:25:29,624 --> 01:25:32,835
- Yes, sir.
- And doesn't she teach?

925
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:35,129
Don't call her "she."

926
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,049
- Doesn't Jennifer teach?
- Let's leave her out of this.

927
01:25:39,217 --> 01:25:41,343
Just write out a check, father.
It's a personal matter.

928
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,012
A very important personal matter.

929
01:25:45,390 --> 01:25:46,974
You got some girl in trouble?

930
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:52,855
Yeah. Yeah. That's it.

931
01:25:58,444 --> 01:26:00,279
Please lend me the money.

932
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:45,240
Thank you, father.

933
01:27:52,892 --> 01:27:54,351
How is she?

934
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,354
She wants the troops
home for Christmas.

935
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:00,649
- Always running the show.
- She may succeed.

936
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:05,028
- That fast?
- Yes.

937
01:28:23,256 --> 01:28:26,425
Hello, baby. Phil.

938
01:28:27,593 --> 01:28:29,136
How's it going, Mrs. B?

939
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:34,725
It's going, preppie.
The troops will be home for Christmas.

940
01:28:34,892 --> 01:28:37,602
- That's a little trite.
- It's the goddamn truth.

941
01:28:39,188 --> 01:28:42,107
Hey, watch your language.
There's a grownup present.

942
01:28:43,276 --> 01:28:46,987
I hope so.
I mean, Phil made a few promises.

943
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,281
Don't worry, Jenny.

944
01:28:52,160 --> 01:28:54,077
Maybe I ought to let you guys...

945
01:28:55,371 --> 01:28:57,164
I'll be nearby.

946
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,968
It doesn't hurt, Ollie.
Really, it doesn't.

947
01:29:12,013 --> 01:29:14,890
It's like falling off a cliff
in slow motion, you know?

948
01:29:17,101 --> 01:29:20,062
Only after a while, you wish
you'd hit the ground, you know?

949
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:23,440
Yeah.

950
01:29:24,317 --> 01:29:26,985
Bullshit. You never fell off a cliff
in your whole life.

951
01:29:28,488 --> 01:29:31,198
Yes, I did... When I met you.

952
01:29:33,868 --> 01:29:37,954
Yeah.
"What a falling off was there."

953
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:43,126
- Who said that?
- I don't know... Shakespeare.

954
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,420
Yeah, but who?

955
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,757
I mean, what play?

956
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:52,469
I went to Radcliffe.
I'm supposed to remember those things.

957
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:01,395
I once knew all
The Mozart Köchel listings.

958
01:30:02,855 --> 01:30:06,316
- Big deal.
- You bet it was.

959
01:30:08,611 --> 01:30:11,947
What number
is the A-major concerto?

960
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:15,742
I don't know. I'll look it up.

961
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,327
No, but I used to know
all those things.

962
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,579
I really did.
I used to know all those things.

963
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,542
You want to talk music?

964
01:30:24,419 --> 01:30:26,461
What do you want to talk, funerals?

965
01:30:31,008 --> 01:30:32,759
No, I don't.

966
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,475
Ollie?

967
01:30:42,103 --> 01:30:46,690
I told Phil you could have
a Catholic service

968
01:30:46,858 --> 01:30:50,360
and you'd say OK. OK?

969
01:30:53,614 --> 01:30:56,283
It will really help him a lot, you know?

970
01:30:59,245 --> 01:31:01,079
OK.

971
01:31:03,541 --> 01:31:07,919
- Now you got to stop being sick.
- Me?

972
01:31:09,922 --> 01:31:12,883
That guilty look on your face...
It's sick.

973
01:31:20,391 --> 01:31:23,393
Would you stop blaming yourself,
you goddamn stupid preppie?

974
01:31:23,561 --> 01:31:25,353
It's nobody's fault.

975
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:33,737
It's not your fault.

976
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,120
That's the only thing
I'm going to ask you.

977
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,997
Otherwise, I know you'll be OK.

978
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:04,434
Screw Paris.

979
01:32:07,146 --> 01:32:08,688
What?

980
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:14,569
Screw Paris and music and all that stuff
you thought you stole from me.

981
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,448
I don't care,
don't you believe that?

982
01:32:29,252 --> 01:32:33,380
Then get the hell out of here.
I don't want you at my goddamn deathbed.

983
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:43,223
I believe you. I really do.

984
01:32:46,435 --> 01:32:48,019
That's better.

985
01:32:52,858 --> 01:32:55,485
Would you please do
something for me, Ollie?

986
01:33:02,994 --> 01:33:04,744
Would you please hold me?

987
01:33:16,549 --> 01:33:20,760
No. I mean, really hold me...
next to me.

988
01:34:33,417 --> 01:34:34,918
Philip.

989
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,224
I wish...

990
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:56,981
I wish I hadn't promised Jenny...

991
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:07,325
I wish I hadn't promised Jenny
to be strong for you.

992
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:52,912
Oliver.

993
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:57,375
Why didn't you tell me?
I made a couple of calls,

994
01:35:57,543 --> 01:36:00,962
and as soon as I found out,
I jumped right in the car.

995
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:02,756
Oliver, I want to help.

996
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:06,676
Jenny's dead.

997
01:36:09,638 --> 01:36:11,514
- I'm sorry...
- Love...

998
01:36:14,477 --> 01:36:17,562
Love means never
having to say you're sorry.
