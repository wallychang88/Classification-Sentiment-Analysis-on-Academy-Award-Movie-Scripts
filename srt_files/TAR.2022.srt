 <i>specializing in</i>

 <i>among the Shipibo-Konibo people.</i> 

45

 <i>at our own</i>
 <i>New York Philharmonic.</i> 

54
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,472

00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:11,098
 <i>"These composers</i>
 <i>are having a conversation</i> 

65
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,934

 <i>(audience laughing)</i> 

75
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,601
GOPNIK: In 2010, with
the support of Eliot Kaplan,

76
00:07:47,635 --> 00:07:50,771
she founded the Accordion
Conducting Fellowship,

77
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,674
which fosters entrepreneurship
and performance opportunities

78
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:57,044
for female conductors,
allowing them residencies

79
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:59,780
with major orchestras
around the world.

80
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:05,118
In 2013, Berlin elected Tár
as its principal conductor,

81
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,521
in succession to Andris Davis,

82
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:10,457
and she's remained there
ever since.

83
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,526
Like her mentor,
Leonard Bernstein,

84
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,495
Tár has a particular
affinity for Mahler,

85
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,831
whose nine symphonies
she recorded

86
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:19,900
during her Big Five stints.

87
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:22,636
However, she never managed
to complete

88
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:26,173
the so-called "cycle" with
a single orchestra until now.

89
00:08:26,206 --> 00:08:27,608
Under her direction,

90
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,643
Berlin has recorded eight
of the Mahler symphonies,

91
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:32,512
saving the big one,
Symphony No. 5, for last.

92
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,782
Due to the pandemic,
that performance,

93
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:37,350
which was scheduled for
last year, had to be canceled.

94
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,352
But I'm told that next month,

95
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:42,055
she'll make a live recording
of Mahler's Fifth,

96
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,724
which will complete the cycle

97
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:47,360
and will be issued in a box set
by Deutsche Grammophon

98
00:08:47,394 --> 00:08:49,529
just in time
for Mahler's birthday.

99
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:53,433
As if that's not enough,
her new book, <i>Tár on Tár,</i> 

100
00:08:53,466 --> 00:08:56,970
will be published by Nan
Talese's imprint at Doubleday,

101
00:08:57,004 --> 00:09:00,407
just in time for Christmas,
a perfect stocking stuffer,

102
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,810
especially if you have
a very large stocking.

108
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,488
Lydia, I couldn't...

109
00:09:15,522 --> 00:09:18,859
I couldn't help but see you
flinch just a little bit

110
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,493
as I was reading your bio.

111
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,562
Was it because I forgot
some other amazing achievement?

112
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:25,065
Or do you have
a slight self-consciousness

113
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:27,234
about the incredibly
varied things

114
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,102
that you've accomplished?

115
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:34,441
Well, in today's world,
"varied," it-it's a dirty word.

116
00:09:34,474 --> 00:09:36,543
I mean,
our era is one of specialists,

117
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,479
and if you're trying to do
more than one thing,

118
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,248
it's, you know,
it's often frowned upon.

119
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:42,850
Every artist gets typecast.

120
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:44,384
Oh, yes. Aggressively so.

121
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,119
Well, do you think there'll be
a moment, though,

122
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,321
when the classical music
community,

123
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:51,792
uh, decides not to use
sexual distinctions

124
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,761
to differentiate artists?

125
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:56,163
I'm probably
the wrong person to ask

126
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,398
since I don't, uh,
read reviews.

127
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,000
-Never, really?
-No.

128
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:04,404
But it is odd, I-I think,
that anyone ever felt compelled

129
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,374
to substitute
"maestro" with "maestra."

130
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,711
I mean, we don't call women
astronauts "astronettes."

131
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,479
-GOPNIK: Mm-hmm. Right.
-(audience chuckling)

132
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:16,249
But as to the question
of, uh, gender bias,

133
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:18,819
I really have nothing
to complain about.

134
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:21,789
Nor, for that matter, should
Marin Alsop, JoAnn Falletta,

135
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:24,257
uh, Laurence Equilbey
and Nathalie Stutzmann.

136
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,994
I mean, there's so many
incredible women

137
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:28,461
who came before us.

138
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,931
You know, women who did
the-the real lifting.

139
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,132
That-that's fascinating.

140
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,101
Can you... Who, for instance?

141
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:35,402
Uh, okay, sure.

142
00:10:35,435 --> 00:10:37,604
Uh, first and foremost,
Nadia Boulanger.

143
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,573
I mean, that would be
the, uh, happy example.

144
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,777
Uh, the sad one would be
Antonia Brico,

145
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:46,747
who by all accounts
was an incredible conductor

146
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:50,117
but was ghettoized
into the nonglamorous status

147
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,185
of a "guest conductor"

148
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:55,088
and essentially
treated as a dog act.

149
00:10:55,122 --> 00:10:57,290
A dog...
Uh, she never got the chance

150
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,525
to lead a major orchestra?

151
00:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,593
Well, yes.
Yes, she did, uh, conduct

152
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:02,763
the, uh, Berlin Philharmonic,
as well as the Met,

153
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:05,966
but, again,
only as a guest conductor.

154
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,001
You know, at, I mean,
at that time it was...

155
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:10,303
it was all gender spectacle.

156
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,739
But fortunately, times change,

157
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:13,707
and-and the Pauline
conversion is...

158
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:15,475
-(chuckling): "Pauline..."
-... if not complete,

159
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,977
then it's-it's evolving nicely.

160
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,646
N-No less, um,
having fallen off its horse.

161
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,149
Um, Lydia, could we talk
a little bit

162
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:24,284
-about, uh, translation?
-Mm-hmm.

163
00:11:24,317 --> 00:11:25,919
'Cause I think
there's still people

164
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:29,289
who think of the conductor
as a kind of human metronome.

165
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:33,326
Well, yeah,
that's-that's partly true.

166
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,128
-Yeah, but it's...
-But keeping time,

167
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,730
it's-it's no small thing.

168
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,732
But I suspect there's
a lot more to it than that.

169
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,433
Yeah, well,
I-I would hope so, yes.

170
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,003
-But time is the thing.
-Uh-huh.

171
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:47,440
Time is-is the essential piece
of, uh, interpretation.

172
00:11:47,474 --> 00:11:49,209
You cannot start without me.

173
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,278
See, I start the clock.

174
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:54,748
Now, my left hand shapes,
but my right hand,

175
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:59,019
the second hand, marks time
and moves it forward.

176
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,090
However, unlike a clock,
sometimes my second hand stops,

177
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:06,226
which means that time stops.

178
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:09,396
Now, the illusion is that,
like you,

179
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:11,664
I'm responding to
the orchestra in real time...

180
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,700
-Right, right. -... making the
decision about the right moment

181
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,402
to restart the thing,
or reset it,

182
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:18,005
or throw time out
the window altogether.

183
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,441
The reality is that right
from the very beginning,

184
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:23,543
I know precisely
what time it is...

185
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,278
-Really? That's...
-... and the exact moment

186
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:28,481
that you and I will arrive
at our destination together.

187
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:32,119
You know, the only real,
uh, discovery for me

188
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,854
is in rehearsal.

189
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,956
It's never,
never in performance.

190
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:39,793
Hard question, I know, but
if you could define one thing

191
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:42,863
that Bernstein gave you,
what would it be?

192
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:46,233
Kavvanah.

193
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,567
Yeah, it's-it's the Hebrew word

194
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,503
for attention to meaning
or-or intent.

195
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,172
You know, what are
the composer's priorities,

196
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:54,607
and what are yours, and how do
they complement one another?

197
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,609
Right, kavvanah. I think
that's a word that will have

198
00:12:56,643 --> 00:12:58,846
a slightly different meaning
for many in our audience.

199
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,915
-Well, yes, yes, I imagine so.
-(audience murmuring)

200
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:03,550
Am I right in thinking
that a conductor

201
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,286
was not always, uh,
an onstage presence

202
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:07,754
-in classical music?
-No, that's right.

203
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,789
I-I think I read someplace
that it actually was

204
00:13:09,823 --> 00:13:11,892
the first violin, for a long
time, who was responsible.

205
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:14,494
Yes, the first violinist,
whether they had any interest

206
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,129
or-or skill in it or not.

207
00:13:16,163 --> 00:13:18,932
Wh-When did that change,
and-and who changed it?

208
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:22,102
With the French composer,
Jean-Baptiste Lully,

209
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:26,106
who reportedly, uh,
used a, uh, rather enormous,

210
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:30,343
rather pointy staff to pound
the tempi into the floor.

211
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,611
It's not something I imagine

212
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,081
the players particularly,
uh, appreciated.

213
00:13:34,114 --> 00:13:37,951
Uh, anyway, uh, that technique
ended during a performance

214
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:39,953
when Lully accidentally

215
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:42,155
stabbed himself in the foot
with the thing and died.

216
00:13:42,189 --> 00:13:45,158
-(audience laughter)
-Yeah, of-of-of gangrene.

217
00:13:45,192 --> 00:13:47,060
But anyway...

218
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,930
-(applause)
-Yeah.

219
00:13:49,963 --> 00:13:53,133
Anyway, but the conductor

220
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:56,904
really becomes essential
as the ensembles get bigger.

221
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,639
And once again,
we go back to Beethoven.

222
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,575
* Buh, buh, buh, bum,
buh, buh, buh, bum. *

223
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,777
Now, that doesn't start
with the eighth note.

224
00:14:04,811 --> 00:14:07,314
The downbeat--
* Buh, buh, buh --

225
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,916
it's silent, right?

226
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:11,618
So someone had to start
that clock.

227
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,621
Someone had to, uh,
plant their flag in the sand

228
00:14:14,654 --> 00:14:17,090
and say, "Follow me," you know?

229
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,660
And when that someone was
Lenny, the orchestra was led

230
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:24,864
on the most extraordinary
tour of pleasures.

231
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:27,767
'Cause he knew the music,
Mahler especially,

232
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,903
as well or better than anyone.

233
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:33,406
And he would often play
with the form.

234
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,807
'Cause he wanted an orchestra
to feel

235
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,876
that they had never seen,
let alone heard

236
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,879
or-or performed
any of that music.

237
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:42,115
So he-he would do
radical things,

238
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,584
like, uh, disregarding
the tempo primo

239
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:46,954
or-or ending this phrase
molto ritardando,

240
00:14:46,987 --> 00:14:49,589
even though
it had no such marking.

241
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,124
Was he over-egging it?

242
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,625
Oh, no, no, no. Not at all.

243
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:56,429
He, he, he celebrated the joy
of his discovery.

244
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,998
You just told us a moment ago

245
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,467
that your discovery
takes place in rehearsal.

246
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,003
When will that process
begin again for you?

247
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,372
We start on Monday.

248
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,340
-Immediately?
-Mm.

249
00:15:07,374 --> 00:15:09,776
With this one,
it really is about

250
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:14,114
trying to read the tea leaves
of-of Mahler's intention.

251
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:15,715
I mean, we know a great deal
about this

252
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,417
with his other symphonies.

253
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,852
You know, he was so inspired
by the poetry of Rückert

254
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:22,055
that for years he didn't set
another author to music.

255
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:25,258
But all of this changes
with the Five.

256
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,560
The Five is a mystery.

257
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,163
And the only clue he leaves us

258
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:32,199
is on the cover
of the manuscript itself.

259
00:15:32,232 --> 00:15:36,469
Yes, the-the dedication
to his new wife, Alma.

260
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:38,471
So if you're gonna partner
with Mahler

261
00:15:38,505 --> 00:15:41,274
on his, uh, fifth symphony,

262
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,842
the first thing you must do

263
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:47,280
is try to understand
that very complex marriage.

264
00:15:47,314 --> 00:15:49,983
And would you say that you have
a different interpretation

265
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:52,452
of that marriage
than Bernstein did?

266
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:58,591
You mentioned my ethnographic
fieldwork in the Amazon.

267
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,394
Well, Adam, the Shipibo-Konibo

268
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,963
only receive an <i>icaro,</i> or song,

269
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:05,898
if the singer is there, right?

270
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:09,736
On the same side of the-the
spirit that-that created it.

271
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:13,173
And in that way, the past
and the present converge.

272
00:16:13,206 --> 00:16:16,843
It's the flip sides
of the same cosmic coin.

273
00:16:16,876 --> 00:16:19,879
That definition of fidelity
makes sense to me.

274
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,215
But Lenny,
he believed in <i>teshuvah.</i> 

275
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:24,817
The Talmudic power
to reach back into time

276
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:27,620
and-and transform
the, uh, significance

277
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:29,322
of one's past deeds.

278
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:33,560
So when he played the Adagietto
at Robert Kennedy's funeral,

279
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,695
it ran for 12 minutes.

280
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,198
-He treated it as a mass.
-(agreeing murmur)

281
00:16:38,231 --> 00:16:39,999
And, you know, if you listen
to a recording of it,

282
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,803
you will no doubt feel
the tragedy and-and the pathos.

283
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,439
And of course
that, uh, interpretation

284
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,608
was very true for Mahler
later in life,

285
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:50,677
after the professional bottom
dropped out

286
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:52,779
and Alma had left him
for Gropius.

287
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:58,017
But, as I said before,
we are dealing with time.

288
00:16:58,051 --> 00:17:02,522
And this piece was not born
into aching tragedy.

289
00:17:02,555 --> 00:17:04,857
It was born into young love.

290
00:17:04,891 --> 00:17:07,294
And so you chose...

291
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,895
Love.

292
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,731
-(audience murmuring)
-Right, but precisely how long?

293
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,300
(quietly):
Well...

294
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,402
seven minutes.

295
00:17:15,435 --> 00:17:17,670
(laughter)

296
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:22,409
WOMAN: I was so taken
by what you said to Adam

297
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,745
about, um, interpretation

298
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,182
and specifically about feelings,

299
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,351
and that you chose love.

300
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,787
And I know it's said
that you should leave the tears

301
00:17:34,821 --> 00:17:37,056
for the audience, but...

302
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,859
do you ever find yourself
overwhelmed by emotion

303
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,561
when you're up there
at the podium?

304
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:43,463
-TÁR: Yes.
-(sighs)

305
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,265
Yes, that does happen.

306
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:48,568
There's an...
an expectation-reward cycle

307
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,503
with some works
and the spots in them

308
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:53,640
that I find so incredible,
that when I'm conducting,

309
00:17:53,673 --> 00:17:56,042
it's not that
I'm rushing exactly,

310
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,745
but, oh, I just can't wait
to get to that spot,

311
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:01,214
and, yeah, it does it.
It does it every time.

312
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:02,682
(laughs softly)

313
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:04,751
So it's physical
as well as emotional.

314
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:06,786
-Hmm. Hmm.
-God, it must take hours

315
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,021
to come back down to earth.

316
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:12,492
You say things after others
remember, but you won't.

317
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:14,727
And sleep, it's impossible.

318
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,663
It's like my freshman year
at Smith.

319
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,598
(Tár chuckles)

320
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:19,932
(sighs)

321
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,701
Which piece does that to you?

322
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,203
Oh, I saw you.

323
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:25,672
I saw you conduct, uh,
 <i>The Rite of Spring</i> 

324
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,174
at the Met last year.

325
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,075
It was so powerful.

326
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,244
TÁR:
Thank you. Thank you.

327
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:34,447
It's...
It's the 11 pistol shots--

328
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:35,848
it's a prime number--

329
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:38,151
that strike you as both victim
and perpetrator.

330
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,919
You know, it's not until
I conducted it

331
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,423
that I became convinced
we're all capable of murder.

332
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,226
That is a fantastic handbag,
by the way.

333
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:48,761
Thank you.
I'm glad you like it.

334
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,397
Oh, I do. I do.

335
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:52,465
(quietly): Sorry.
Your lunch with Mr. Kaplan.

336
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:54,234
His driver is waiting.

337
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:55,302
All right.

338
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,636
I-I'm sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

339
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:58,205
-Whitney. Whitney Reese.
-Whitney.

340
00:18:58,238 --> 00:18:59,406
Whitney, of course.

341
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:00,907
I'm, I'm so sorry,

342
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,342
and unfortunately
I've left things a bit late

343
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,743
-and there's something
I can't get out of. -Oh.

344
00:19:03,776 --> 00:19:05,144
I understand.

345
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,380
Can I text you?

346
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:28,901
It's perfect, Aldo.

347
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:33,840
Oh. I was hoping
we could celebrate.

348
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:36,008
No. So was I.

349
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,644
I've got a class at Juilliard.

350
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,811
Oh, good.

351
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,480
I promised Ben.

352
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,016
I'm sure you'll have a few
elbowing for an Accordion slot.

353
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:47,720
We should open up
the fellowship.

354
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:50,022
-What, expand our numbers?
-No, our sex.

355
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:53,360
I mean, it feels quaint
to keep things single-gender.

356
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:54,694
We've made our point.

357
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,296
And, honestly,
we've had no real trouble

358
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:58,431
successfully placing
any of them.

359
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,333
Except one.

360
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:01,968
Oh, well.

361
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:04,271
She had issues.

362
00:20:04,304 --> 00:20:05,905
So I've heard.

363
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:07,807
The topic comes up
in every Citibank meeting

364
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,443
with her father.

365
00:20:10,477 --> 00:20:11,811
I'm sorry about that.

366
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,079
It's fine.

367
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:15,515
It's nothing I can't handle.

368
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:20,787
So, you want to torpedo
Accordion's founding principle?

369
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,822
We'd likely lose donors.

370
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:25,224
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

371
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,494
M-Maybe it's something
we revisit

372
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:29,296
-down the line.
-Sure.

373
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:31,998
Now, Bryant Park's locked
for the 25th.

374
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:34,066
Nan asked me
to help fill the place,

375
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,835
so the Kaplan Fund
is gonna buy some radio

376
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,870
and outdoor advertising.

377
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,006
And claqueurs.

378
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:41,374
It's too big, Eliot.

379
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,109
She should have booked
the Strand.

380
00:20:43,142 --> 00:20:44,477
Relax.

381
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,679
It'll be great.

382
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,081
And it almost falls
on your birthday.

383
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:53,520
I was, uh, I was sorry
you weren't able to make it

384
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,388
to my Mahler Three in London.

385
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:58,157
Me, too.

386
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:01,961
Uh, Petra had a school thing.

387
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:06,399
Uh, and I promised Sharon
I'd be there.

388
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,769
Of course.

389
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:13,039
I was just hoping
for your honest opinion.

390
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:15,908
My player rating sheets
were off the charts.

391
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:17,877
Those are confidential, Eliot.

392
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,179
Well, the principal oboist
is a big fan.

393
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:22,582
On the way back,

394
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,451
I was listening to yours
with the Israeli Phil,

395
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,453
and I was struck
by what you managed to pull

396
00:21:26,486 --> 00:21:28,955
from the strings
in the last movement.

397
00:21:28,988 --> 00:21:32,559
I mean, how did you
get them there?

398
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,926
Was it the hall?

399
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,562
Was it the players?

400
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:38,798
(scoffs) The players weren't
very obliging.

401
00:21:38,831 --> 00:21:40,533
The principal violinist
came up to me

402
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,801
after the first rehearsal

403
00:21:41,834 --> 00:21:43,803
-and asked if I was a Jew.
-What?

404
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,706
It seemed to him unusual, if
not suspicious, that a non-Jew

405
00:21:46,739 --> 00:21:50,042
would be interested
in conducting Jewish music.

406
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:53,012
-(Eliot chuckles)
-Felt like Max Bruch.

407
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:56,282
Well, big Jew that I am,
the Kaplan Fund has, uh,

408
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,250
committed a sizable
amount to them

409
00:21:58,284 --> 00:22:00,119
-for a klezmer commission.
-Mm-hmm.

410
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,121
Uh, maybe they'll invite me
to guest conduct.

411
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,990
Oh, well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

412
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:05,858
Oh, please.

413
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:08,027
I know my place.

414
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,497
Money can't always
buy you everything.

415
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,700
You don't really believe that.

416
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:16,035
I'll have you know
I tried to bribe Francesca

417
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,704
to let me look at your notation.

418
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,271
She sent me packing.

419
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,707
Good girl.

420
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:23,376
That gentleman sitting
over there with the gnome

421
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,945
is urgently focused
on our table.

422
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:29,181
At first, I thought
he was looking at me,

423
00:22:29,215 --> 00:22:31,283
but I think he's got
his eye on you.

424
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,319
Please try and ignore him.

425
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,622
I can excuse myself
and go wash my hands

426
00:22:35,655 --> 00:22:37,156
if you'd like to be alone.

427
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,226
And I would never forgive you.

428
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,261
The last thing I need
is to be buttonholed in here

429
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,431
by someone exactly like me.

430
00:22:45,998 --> 00:22:47,767
Uh, what time are you
leaving tomorrow?

431
00:22:48,568 --> 00:22:51,103
Francesca's looking
into flights.

432
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:52,639
Well, call her off.

433
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,240
Leave when you like.

434
00:22:54,273 --> 00:22:56,242
You don't have to do that.

435
00:22:56,275 --> 00:23:00,079
My motives are not entirely
altruistic.

436
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,582
Just one peek. One peek
at your performing score.

437
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:05,351
(Tár chuckles)

438
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,853
Fine.

439
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:09,789
-Would 5:15 be okay?
-Sure.

440
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,959
Okay, I mean, I do... I have
to get turned around fast.

441
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:15,294
We're filling a vacant position.

442
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,464
Oh, please tell me
it's Sebastian.

443
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,798
Now, be fair, Eliot.

444
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,067
Sebastian has decent technique.

445
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,502
He has baton.

446
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:24,203
A month ago,
I dropped into Bunkamura

447
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,406
to watch the Turing machine
trot out Chopin One.

448
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,977
Ol' Sebastian really
is Mr. Tempo Rubato.

449
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:32,679
Robot-o is more like it.

450
00:23:32,712 --> 00:23:33,980
Why do you keep him on?

451
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,348
Oh, he's Andris's man,
you know that.

452
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,917
Exactly. You inherited
that decision.

453
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,086
Seven years is a long time
to pretend you respect it.

454
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:42,421
They have different
labor contracts over there.

455
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,794
He's a... he's a strange guy.

456
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:49,095
Who? Andris?

457
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,097
No, Sebastian.

458
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,766
He has, uh, fetishes.

459
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,602
Fetishes? Like what?

460
00:23:55,635 --> 00:23:59,305
Nostalgia for prewar Kalmus
miniature scores,

461
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:01,207
dead-stock pencils he's seen

462
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,309
von Karajan hold in photographs.

463
00:24:03,342 --> 00:24:05,211
You know, that sort of thing.

464
00:24:05,244 --> 00:24:07,614
(scoffs)
That's just sad.

465
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:14,453
Yeah, but you're not wrong.

466
00:24:14,487 --> 00:24:17,490
I am gonna have to rotate him
at some point.

467
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,128
For who?

468
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,067
 <i>What Love Teaches Me.</i> 

469
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,336
That string notation.

470
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:34,006
Mahler gives it to you himself.

471
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,777
-Come on.
-Trust me.

472
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:39,345
You do not want to go to school

473
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:41,848
on someone else's
red and blue pencil.

474
00:24:41,881 --> 00:24:43,516
Least of all, mine.

475
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,784
Oh, but I do.

476
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,385
(sighs) All right.
Will you quit pestering me?

477
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,487
Yes.

478
00:24:48,521 --> 00:24:50,489
Free bowing.

479
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:54,393
It's not pretty
for an audience to look at,

480
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:56,028
but if you can manage
to keep your players

481
00:24:56,062 --> 00:24:57,697
out of the weeds...

482
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,733
... the sound's ferocious.

483
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,436
Oh.

484
00:25:07,707 --> 00:25:10,710
There's no glory
for a robot, Eliot.

485
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,549
Do your own thing.

486
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:20,720
Hmm.

487
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:26,392
(piano plays deep chord)

488
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,661
(playing "Ró"
by Anna Thorvaldsdóttir)

489
00:25:32,164 --> 00:25:34,366
-(hollow thump)
-(soft knock)

490
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:38,838
-(soft knock)
-(hollow thump)

491
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,240
-All right, um...
-(playing stops)

492
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:44,076
Let's... stop here.

493
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,712
-Thank you, Max. Very good.
-Thanks.

494
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:50,850
Um, just for my own
edification...

495
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:53,052
why did you come to Juilliard?

496
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,121
(Max clicks tongue)

497
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:58,658
Uh, it's the best music
conservatory in the country?

498
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,594
People from Curtis, Eastman,
and others may beg to differ.

499
00:26:01,628 --> 00:26:04,230
I mean,
Juilliard's a brand, right?

500
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,066
So, did you come to study
with a brand?

501
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,368
-No. -No, right.
So there's a teacher

502
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,604
or graduate somewhere
down the line who, you know,

503
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:13,305
conjured something
in your imagination.

504
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:15,675
-Someone you aspire
to be yourself. -Mm-hmm.

505
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:17,243
So, who was that?

506
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,911
Sarah Chang.

507
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,813
Hmm. So you're a violinist?

508
00:26:20,847 --> 00:26:22,348
-Yeah.
-All right, okay.

509
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:24,216
Well, I can see why

510
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,719
you would choose to conduct
a piece like this.

511
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:29,321
Must be a familiar pleasure
in presiding over

512
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,191
a bed of strings that behave
as if they're tuning.

513
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:34,160
-(scattered laughter)
-Now...

514
00:26:34,193 --> 00:26:38,597
this piece is very au courant.

515
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,300
I mean, here,
the composer tells us

516
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,469
to begin with "back-and-forth
tremolo strokes

517
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:47,506
with wire brush and slowly
sliding crotales over skin."

518
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,042
Sounds like René Redzepi's
recipe for reindeer.

519
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:51,678
(sighs heavily)

520
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:54,280
It's exciting to play
new music, isn't it?

521
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,748
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

522
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:59,118
Great. All right, please,
join the other fellows.

523
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,890
Now, I know you're all
conducting students

524
00:27:03,923 --> 00:27:06,859
of, uh, Mr. Wolfe's,
but how many of you

525
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:10,029
are also studying composition?

526
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:11,630
Right, what's your name?

527
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:13,099
Olive Kerr.

528
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,668
All right, Olive. Uh...

529
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:18,170
What do you make of what
we've just been listening to?

530
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:19,972
It's pretty awesome.

531
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:23,242
I mean, there's incredible
atonal tension.

532
00:27:23,275 --> 00:27:25,544
I agree about the tension part.

533
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:29,448
Now, you can intellectually
contemplate, or masturbate,

534
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,185
about the felicity
of the so-called "atonal,"

535
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:39,058
but the important question here
is: What are you conducting?

536
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:40,326
What is the effect?

537
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,329
What is it actually doing to me?

538
00:27:43,362 --> 00:27:47,199
Good music can be
as ornate as a cathedral

539
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:49,468
or bare as a potting shed

540
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:52,972
so long as it allows you to
answer both those questions.

541
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,174
-(claps hands)
-Max.

542
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,543
Come on, what do you think?

543
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:05,351
When... Anna Thorvaldsdóttir
gave her master class,

544
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:09,221
she said she was often
influenced by the form

545
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:14,693
and structure of landscapes
and nature she grew up within.

546
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:17,296
But I'm not sure
she was interested per se

547
00:28:17,329 --> 00:28:20,432
in, uh, describing
those actual sounds.

548
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:23,169
Very <i>Punkt Kontra Punkt.</i> 

549
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,805
Yes.

550
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:30,709
The intent of her composition
is vague, to say the least.

551
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:35,647
So, if her intent is vague,
how do you, as a conductor,

552
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,185
have a point of view
about anything?

553
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,820
Now, to be fair, I mean,

554
00:28:40,853 --> 00:28:43,155
there are times when you will
simply have no choice.

555
00:28:43,189 --> 00:28:45,858
And you will be made to stand
in front of an orchestra

556
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:49,128
and pretend that there are
these invisible structures.

557
00:28:49,161 --> 00:28:52,264
But my prayer for you

558
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,433
is that you will be spared
the embarrassment

559
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:56,735
of standing on the podium
with a 4'33",

560
00:28:56,769 --> 00:28:59,371
trying to sell a car
without an engine.

561
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,507
Because now, my friends,

562
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,777
now is the time to conduct music

563
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:08,314
that actually requires
something of you.

564
00:29:08,347 --> 00:29:09,949
You know,
music that everybody knows

565
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:14,620
but will hear differently
when you interpret it for them.

566
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:18,290
For instance, Max,
why not a Kyrie?

567
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:23,495
You know, like, uh, something
like Bach's <i>Mass in B minor.</i> 

568
00:29:23,529 --> 00:29:25,197
(chuckles nervously)

569
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:27,166
I'm not really into Bach.

570
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,969
-You're not into Bach?
-Mm-hmm.

571
00:29:30,002 --> 00:29:31,804
Oh, Max.

572
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:34,907
Have you read
the Schweitzer book?

573
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,442
No.

574
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:38,110
Well, you should.

575
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:40,446
It's an important text.

576
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,882
Now, Antonia Brico thought so.

577
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:45,784
So much so that she shipped
herself to Equatorial Africa

578
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,654
and canoed up the Congo River
to track Schweitzer down

579
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:51,790
and ask him to teach her
what he knew about Bach.

580
00:29:51,824 --> 00:29:53,559
I mean, somewhere,
I've got a picture of her

581
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:56,062
in a, in a pith helmet.

582
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:57,529
I mean, have you...

583
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:01,567
have you ever played
or-or conducted Bach?

584
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:07,239
Honestly, as a BIPOC,
pangender person,

585
00:30:07,273 --> 00:30:08,941
I would say Bach's
misogynistic life

586
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:12,144
makes it kind of impossible
for me

587
00:30:12,178 --> 00:30:14,580
to take his music seriously.

588
00:30:15,982 --> 00:30:17,749
Come on.

589
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:20,719
What do... what do...
what do you mean by that?

590
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,656
Well, didn't he sire,
like, 20 kids?

591
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,859
Yes, that's documented.

592
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:30,629
Along with a considerable
amount of music.

593
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,999
But I'm sorry,
I'm... I'm unclear

594
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,667
as to what his prodigious
skills in the marital bed

595
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,005
have to do with B minor.

596
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:40,472
Sure.

597
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:43,142
All right, whatever.
That's-that's your choice.

598
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:46,045
I mean, after all, "a soul
selects her own society."

599
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,881
But remember, the flip side
of that selection

600
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,850
closes the valves
of one's attention.

601
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:56,188
Now, of course,
siloing what is acceptable

602
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:59,591
or not acceptable
is a basic construct of many,

603
00:30:59,625 --> 00:31:01,994
if not most,
symphony orchestras today,

604
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:04,096
who see it
as their imperial right

605
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,697
to curate for the cretins.

606
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:07,699
So, slippery as it is,

607
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:11,337
there is some merit
in examining Max's allergy.

608
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:14,806
Can classical music
written by a bunch of straight,

609
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,010
Austro-German, churchgoing
white guys exalt us,

610
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,612
individually
as-as well as collectively,

611
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:24,650
and who, may I ask,
gets to decide that?

612
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:28,087
(sighs)
You know, what about Beethoven?

613
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,888
You into him?

614
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:32,758
Because for me,
as a U-Haul lesbian,

615
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:35,995
I'm... I'm not too sure
about old Ludwig.

616
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:40,499
But then, I face him.

617
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,734
And I find myself nose-to-nose

618
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:47,139
with his magnitude
and inevitability.

619
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,544
Come on, Max. Indulge me.

620
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:56,048
Let's allow Bach a similar gaze.

621
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,316
(inhales deeply)

622
00:31:57,349 --> 00:32:00,719
(playing Bach's Präludium
und Fuge C-Dur. BWV 846)

623
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,054
Sit.

624
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:07,960
Now, this is all
filigree, right?

625
00:32:07,994 --> 00:32:12,764
I mean, it could be
a first-year piano student.

626
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:17,436
* Or Schroeder playing
for Lucy. *

627
00:32:19,405 --> 00:32:21,807
Or Glenn Gould, for that matter.

628
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,880
Now, it's not until
it changes...

629
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,483
... when you get inside it,

630
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,085
that you hear what it really is.

631
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:34,853
It's a question.

632
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,158
And an answer.

633
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:43,595
Which begs another question.

634
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,000
There's a humility in Bach.

635
00:32:48,034 --> 00:32:51,937
He's not pretending
he's certain about anything.

636
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,906
'Cause he knows
that it's always the question

637
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,943
that involves the listener.

638
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,080
It's never the answer, right?

639
00:33:01,113 --> 00:33:04,783
Now, the big question
for you is:

640
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,119
(growling):
What do you think, Max?

641
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,125
(exhales)

642
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:15,194
You play really well.

643
00:33:15,227 --> 00:33:21,467
But nowadays, white, male, cis
composers, just not my thing.

644
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,737
Don't be so eager
to be offended.

645
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,906
The narcissism
of small differences

646
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:30,676
leads to the most boring
conformity.

647
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,744
I guess Edgard Varèse is okay.

648
00:33:32,778 --> 00:33:34,713
I mean, I like "Arcana," anyway.

649
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:37,749
Oh, well, then you must be
aware that Varèse

650
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:40,052
once famously stated that jazz

651
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:44,323
was "a Negro product
exploited by the Jews."

652
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:47,025
Didn't stop Jerry Goldsmith
from ripping him off

653
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,195
for his
 <i>Planet of the Apes</i> score.

654
00:33:49,228 --> 00:33:51,830
It's kind of a perfect insult,
don't you think?

655
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,601
But you see, the problem
with enrolling yourself

656
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,104
as an ultrasonic epistemic
dissident

657
00:33:58,137 --> 00:34:01,807
is that if Bach's talent
can be reduced to his gender,

658
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,843
birth country, religion,
sexuality, and so on,

659
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,479
then so can yours.

660
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:11,083
Now, someday, Max,
when you go out into the world

661
00:34:11,117 --> 00:34:14,620
and you guest conduct
for a major or minor orchestra,

662
00:34:14,653 --> 00:34:17,789
you may notice that the players
have more than light bulbs

663
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:20,292
and music on their stands.

664
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:23,695
They will also have been
handed rating sheets,

665
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,665
the purpose of which
is to rate you.

666
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:29,034
Now, what kind of criteria

667
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:31,570
would you hope that they would
use to do this?

668
00:34:31,603 --> 00:34:35,006
Your score reading and stick
technique, or something else?

669
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,480
All right, everyone,
using Max's criteria,

670
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:44,082
let's consider Max's thing.

671
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,918
In this case,
Anna Thorvaldsdóttir.

672
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:50,722
Now, can we agree on two pieces
of observation?

673
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,225
One, that Anna was born
in Iceland.

674
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,561
And two, that she is,
in a, I don't know,

675
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,330
Waldorf teacher kinda way,
a superhot young woman.

676
00:34:58,364 --> 00:35:00,166
Show of hands.

677
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:02,501
All right,
now let's turn our gaze

678
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:04,436
back to the piano bench up there

679
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,839
and see if we can square
how any of those things

680
00:35:07,873 --> 00:35:12,178
possibly relate to the person
we see seated before us.

681
00:35:12,211 --> 00:35:14,079
(lid slams shut)

682
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,750
Oh, where are you going?

683
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:23,789
You're a fucking bitch.

684
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,324
(Tár grunts)

685
00:35:25,357 --> 00:35:27,326
And you are a robot.

686
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,928
I mean, unfortunately,
the architect of your soul

687
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:32,598
appears to be social media.

688
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,967
You want to dance the mask,
you must service the composer.

689
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:37,303
You gotta sublimate yourself,

690
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:40,372
your ego, and, yes,
your identity.

691
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,974
You must, in fact, stand
in front of the public and God

692
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,844
and obliterate yourself.

693
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:49,615
(sighs):
All right.

694
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,317
ALEC BALDWIN (over computer):
During the lockdown,

695
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,685
you did something
I thought remarkable.

696
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,321
You made music for free.

697
00:35:55,354 --> 00:35:58,023
Anyone at all could stream
Berlin performances

698
00:35:58,056 --> 00:36:00,592
without ever paying a dime.

699
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,528
TÁR:
Well, that-that was a...

700
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,897
it's a democratically made
decision by the players.

701
00:36:05,931 --> 00:36:10,135
And though I-I wish I could
claim the idea was mine,

702
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,705
it really did spring from
the heart of Sharon Goodnow.

703
00:36:13,739 --> 00:36:15,073
BALDWIN:
Sharon is your partner.

704
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:16,442
You have a child together,

705
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:19,177
and she's also the
concertmaster for Berlin.

706
00:36:19,211 --> 00:36:21,146
-Does that ever...
-Yes, that's right.

707
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,981
... complicate things for you?

708
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,950
Your work getting into your
home or the other way ar...?

709
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,219
(indistinct chatter)

710
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,198
FRANCESCA:
Jake said he was certain

711
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,000
you'd be happy with the drape
of the seat.

712
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,502
I will be... (sighs)

713
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,037
... if I can keep the fat off
until next month.

714
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,907
(laughs):
You never gain weight.

715
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,443
(laughs softly)

716
00:36:52,244 --> 00:36:54,413
Your... your mother texted me.

717
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:56,915
She knows you're busy
but is hoping to drop by.

718
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,450
(clears throat nervously)

719
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:00,085
Next trip.

720
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,454
What are you thinking
for dinner?

721
00:37:02,488 --> 00:37:04,055
Uh, no.

722
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,958
No, I'm-I'm gonna stay in
and put this piano to good use.

723
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:10,562
I'm suspicious of the E natural
in the cello line.

724
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,832
Doesn't it sound like
warmed-over Charles Ives to you?

725
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,834
Not-not at all.

726
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,836
But don't worry,
I'll call Houston.

727
00:37:17,869 --> 00:37:19,271
They'll be flexible.

728
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:21,873
(sighs) You must have
some New Haven friends

729
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:24,042
you want to see tonight?

730
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,378
(chuckles):
No. Not really.

731
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,013
(Tár sighs, sniffs)

732
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:31,082
Should I stop by later
for notes?

733
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,218
No, that won't be necessary.

734
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,087
-(playing dramatic melody)
-(quietly): Okay.

735
00:37:38,524 --> 00:37:43,995
Oh, I, I-I almost forgot, but...

736
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:46,798
this was left for you
at the front desk.

737
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:47,933
By who?

738
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:49,935
They didn't say.

739
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,803
Wh-What, no card?

740
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,071
No.

741
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,206
Okay, just, just leave it
over there.

742
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,408
Thanks.

743
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,477

744
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,420
Good night.

745
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:10,021
Night.

Over the next few weeks,

we'll be hearing poems

When were you informed of this?

761
00:38:56,968 --> 00:38:59,638
FRANCESCA:
Just this morning.

762
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,907
Mr. Kaplan was very apologetic.

763
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,341
I was able to get us on

764
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,976
the 7:00 a.m. you like,
through Munich.

765
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,211
The connection's short,

766
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,113
but special services
are standing by.

767
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:10,181
Where are things with DG?

768
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,818
Please tell me they've finally
woken up to see the wisdom

769
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,186
of honest-to-God LPs
for this release?

770
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,288
-(Tár sighs)
-No movement there yet.

771
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:19,057
Have you looked at the email
I drafted for you?

772
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,459
-Sent it last night.
-Mm-hmm.

773
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:23,261
-Well, just forward me
their response. -Mm-hmm.

774
00:39:24,229 --> 00:39:27,265
What's your take
on <i>The New Yorker</i> talk?

775
00:39:28,634 --> 00:39:29,968
It went well, I thought.

776
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,703
Oh. You're hedging.

777
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:32,904
(Francesca chuckles softly)

778
00:39:32,938 --> 00:39:34,272
I was garrulous.

779
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,641
-No.
-(chuckles)

780
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,876
No, not at all.
You, you were fabulous.

781
00:39:37,909 --> 00:39:40,311
(laughs):
Francesca.

782
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,981
If you have any real interest
in conducting,

783
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:44,916
you need to be able
to speak your mind.

784
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:46,785
Okay. Perhaps you...

785
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:49,455
You could've made less
of the relationship with...

786
00:39:49,488 --> 00:39:50,956
-Lenny?
-No.

787
00:39:50,989 --> 00:39:53,358
I-I was thinking
about Mahler and Alma's.

788
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,260
-Oh. Huh. -You implied
that she betrayed him.

789
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:58,497
I'm not, I'm not sure
I agree with that.

790
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,931
Oh, really?

791
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,467
Alma was a composer, too,

792
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,835
but he insisted
she stop writing music.

793
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,504
He said there was
only room for...

794
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,739
-One asshole in the house?
-One asshole in the house. Yes.

795
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,374
And she agreed to those rules.

796
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,810
No one made that decision
for her.

797
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:14,880
#RulesOfTheGame.

798
00:40:18,183 --> 00:40:20,552

800
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,160
How was your evening?

801
00:40:29,194 --> 00:40:31,630
Yeah, was uneventful.

802
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,199
Are there any
of Sharon's pills left?

803
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,135
No, but Dr. Korovin
called these in.

804
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,638
Ah, thanks.

805
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:44,375
(exhales heavily)

806
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:50,081
I received another weird email
from Krista.

807
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:53,685
-Mm-hmm.
-How should I reply?

808
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,386
Don't.

809
00:40:56,788 --> 00:41:00,191
Well, this one felt
especially desperate.

810
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:02,260

837
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:42,387
Is this the right one?

838
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:45,390
Yeah.

839
00:43:50,195 --> 00:43:52,297
Thank you.

840
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,402
Is that a new bag?

841
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,038
Oh, it's just a gift from Eliot.

842
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:01,439

You want it?

843
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,774
No.

844
00:44:04,009 --> 00:44:05,443

TÁR:
Hmm.

856
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:51,289
And again at the hotel.

857
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,725
Must've been asleep.

858
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,494
You never sleep that deeply.

859
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,764
No, no, don't be a scold.

860
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:02,667

00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:12,911
I'm worried about Petra.

863
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,649
She's starting to disappear
into herself.

864
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:21,652
Be specific.

865
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:28,026
She keeps coming home
with bruises on her shins.

866
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,463
And then when I ask her
about it, she gets quiet.

867
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,734
I mean, I hope
it's just playground football

868
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:39,570
and not some <i>Biodeutsche</i> thing.

869
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:42,507
Hmm, we talked about this.

870
00:45:43,809 --> 00:45:46,945
But maybe we just need
to put more effort

871
00:45:46,978 --> 00:45:49,881
into finding her a friend.

872
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:51,783
Last year was really hard

873
00:45:51,817 --> 00:45:55,320
to be locked up alone
with two old ladies like us.

874
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,692
She's old enough to learn piano.

875
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:05,430
I'll teach her.

876
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,433
(Sharon laughs softly)

877
00:46:10,168 --> 00:46:12,337
Yeah.

878
00:46:12,370 --> 00:46:14,772
That might be good.

879
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:18,243
How's your heart?

880
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:21,412
Better now.

881
00:46:22,547 --> 00:46:24,782
(song continues playing)

882
00:46:38,296 --> 00:46:41,900
(Symphony No. 5 in D Minor,
Op. 47: IV. Finale over radio)

883
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,304
(sighs):
Knock, knock. Who's there?

884
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:48,974
Lenny?

885
00:46:49,007 --> 00:46:51,309
Walter?

886
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:54,245
Oh, it's you, MTT.

887
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:57,448
Why do you insist on holding
things up like that?

888
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,050
Your business here is rejoicing,

889
00:46:59,084 --> 00:47:02,888
not screaming
like a fucking porn star.

890
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,023
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Michael Tilson
Thomas... (speaks German)

891
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:07,292
(toothbrush buzzing)

892
00:47:13,531 --> 00:47:15,666
Hello, Petra.

893
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:20,705
Why are you lurking? Hmm?

894
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:23,841
Tell me and I'll help.

895
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:26,211
-TÁR: Sharon?
-Hmm?

896
00:47:26,244 --> 00:47:28,346
Uh, I'm taking Petra to school.

897
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:29,847
Oh, okay.

898
00:47:29,881 --> 00:47:32,583
-Come on.
 <i>-Tschüss.</i> 

899
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,406
TÁR:
Who'll bear the pall?

900
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,075
"We," said the wren,

901
00:47:57,108 --> 00:48:00,245
-"both the cock and the hen."
-The hen.

902
00:48:00,278 --> 00:48:01,947
"I'll..." (sputters)

903
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,449
BOTH:
"We'll bear the pall."

904
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:06,151
And who'll sing a psalm?

905
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:10,655
"I," said the thrush
as she sat on a bush.

906
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:12,723
"I'll sing a song."

907
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,993
"Who'll toll the bell?"

908
00:48:15,026 --> 00:48:16,394
"I," said the bull,

909
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:19,030
"because I can pull.

910
00:48:19,064 --> 00:48:20,431
I'll toll the bell."

911
00:48:20,465 --> 00:48:23,301
BOTH:
All the birds of the air

912
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:26,371
fell a-sighing and a-sobbing

913
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,374
when they heard the bell toll

914
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:33,411
for poor Cock Robin!

915
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:39,917
(children chattering)

916
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:42,387
TÁR:
It's gonna be okay.

917
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,060
All right.
Okay, which one is she?

918
00:48:49,094 --> 00:48:51,062
The red one.

919
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:56,001
-Bye.
-Go on.

920
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,540
(children continue chattering)

921
00:49:06,911 --> 00:49:08,879
TÁR:
 <i>Hallo,</i> Johanna.

922
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:05,536
TÁR:
Hello. Hi.

923
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:14,179
They're all in the chamber hall?

924
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,081
Yes.

925
00:50:16,114 --> 00:50:18,149
No.

926
00:50:19,317 --> 00:50:21,552
(Tár sighs)

927
00:50:41,339 --> 00:50:43,608
(latch clicks)

928
00:50:52,183 --> 00:50:54,252
(urinating)

929
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,625
(sniffs)
Good morning.

930
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,961
Oh, I'm sorry, Maestro.

931
00:51:03,994 --> 00:51:05,996
We weren't sure you were coming.

932
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:09,267
We were told there might be,
um, a scheduling conflict.

933
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,369
-Would you like me
to take notes? -(clicking pen)

934
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:12,670
No, thank you, Sebastian.

935
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:14,004
-That won't be necessary.
-(clicking stops)

936
00:51:14,038 --> 00:51:15,840
Do we all have
our rating sheets?

937
00:51:15,873 --> 00:51:17,508
-We narrowed it down to three.
-Mm-hmm.

938
00:51:17,542 --> 00:51:19,910
So, unless anyone has
other business to discuss,

939
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:22,012
let's bring in number one.

940
00:51:23,681 --> 00:51:27,118
(cello playing <i>Tannhäuser und</i>
 <i>der Sängerkrieg auf Wartburg)</i> 

941
00:51:37,562 --> 00:51:40,998
(cello playing <i>Verdi Messa</i>
 <i>da Requiem</i> (Offertorio))

942
00:51:57,415 --> 00:52:00,851
(cello playing <i>Pathétique</i>
(Allegro con graza))

943
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,366
(playing stops)

944
00:52:18,836 --> 00:52:21,071
(footsteps)

945
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,755
(low chattering)

946
00:52:39,056 --> 00:52:41,859
Goossens stands, sounds his A.

947
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:44,795
And of course, uh, Léon
was rather famous

948
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:49,099
-for his, um, rather wide
vibrato, huh? -Hmm.

949
00:52:49,133 --> 00:52:52,670
Beecham looks up and says,
"Gentlemen, take your pick."

950
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:55,473
(both chuckling)

951
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,308
How's the writing going?

952
00:52:57,342 --> 00:53:00,545
Ah, I never know how
to answer that question.

953
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:01,912
No.

954
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:04,515
Makes it sound like
a physical act.

955
00:53:04,549 --> 00:53:06,551
Like, how's the shitting going?

956
00:53:06,584 --> 00:53:08,253
(laughing)

957
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,520
Okay.

958
00:53:09,554 --> 00:53:11,489
How's the thinking going?

959
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,924
Yeah, not so well.

960
00:53:13,958 --> 00:53:16,327
I keep hearing something
and getting excited

961
00:53:16,361 --> 00:53:20,097
only to catch myself
in pastiche.

962
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:21,599
Hmm.

963
00:53:21,632 --> 00:53:23,901
Uh, it's all pastiche.

964
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,404
We all have the same
musical grammar.

965
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:29,206
Uh, just look at Beethoven Five.

966
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:32,443
The third movement's theme has
the same sequence of intervals

967
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:36,146
as the opening theme of the
final movement of Mozart Forty.

968
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:38,583
Mm, th-that could've been
a coincidence.

969
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:40,418
No. Not in this case.

970
00:53:40,451 --> 00:53:43,254
If you examine
the sketchbooks he used,

971
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:47,492
29 bars of Mozart's
finale appear.

972
00:53:47,525 --> 00:53:49,627
Copied out by Beethoven.

973
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,064
Oh, my God. I find that
extremely depressing.

974
00:53:54,098 --> 00:53:55,866
I finished reading
your manuscript.

975
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,635
It's very good, Lydia.

976
00:53:57,668 --> 00:53:59,737
One for the ages.

977
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:02,039
And, I dare say,
will be available

978
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:03,708
long after my book
has been forgotten.

979
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,242
Oh, yes, you're right.

980
00:54:05,276 --> 00:54:08,779
The entire first printing
will always be available.

981
00:54:08,813 --> 00:54:11,048
Too modest, as usual.

982
00:54:19,724 --> 00:54:21,792
Thank you, Andris.

983
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:24,562
I'll cherish this.

984
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:26,797
You may use it.

985
00:54:26,831 --> 00:54:29,166
A-a blurb for the covers.

986
00:54:30,468 --> 00:54:33,003
Oh, thank you.

987
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:35,005
I'll send it to the publisher.

988
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:36,974
Hopefully, there's still time.

989
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:39,209
I'm proud to call you my pupil,

990
00:54:39,243 --> 00:54:40,745
uh, even though there was really

991
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,979
nothing I could teach you.

992
00:54:42,012 --> 00:54:43,514
Now, that's not true.

993
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:46,283
I'd never have the position
here were it not for you.

994
00:54:46,317 --> 00:54:48,886
Then you'd be in London,
New York.

995
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:50,888
They're not Berlin.

996
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:54,492
Besides, I'm not sure
what Sharon would do,

997
00:54:54,525 --> 00:54:55,726
were we ever to leave.

998
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,562
She's so close with her family.

999
00:54:57,595 --> 00:55:01,131
Ah, yeah, the Goodnow sisters.

1000
00:55:01,165 --> 00:55:03,801
I remember the elder one
being an absolute ball-breaker

1001
00:55:03,834 --> 00:55:06,937
while she still held sway at DG.

1002
00:55:06,971 --> 00:55:10,875
-Heike is a woman
of many opinions. -Oh.

1003
00:55:10,908 --> 00:55:12,142
And that voice.

1004
00:55:12,176 --> 00:55:13,611
I mean, the signal-to-noise
ratio,

1005
00:55:13,644 --> 00:55:15,580
-it's unbearable.
-(chuckles)

1006
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:17,948
I've had to bolt-hole
at my old place in town

1007
00:55:17,982 --> 00:55:20,451
to get any writing done.

1008
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,052
Schopenhauer measured
a man's intelligence

1009
00:55:22,086 --> 00:55:24,321
against his sensitivity
to noise.

1010
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:25,723
(chuckles)

1011
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,793
Didn't he once also throw
a woman down a flight of stairs

1012
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:30,461
who later sued him?

1013
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:31,662
(chuckles):
Yes.

1014
00:55:31,696 --> 00:55:33,230
Although, it's unclear

1015
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,832
this private
and personal failing

1016
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,635
is at all relevant to his work.

1017
00:55:37,668 --> 00:55:39,904
(both chuckling)

1018
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,172
(tires squeal)

1019
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,077
You're late.

1020
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:48,646
(driver speaking German)

1021
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:49,847
Here, give me your stick.

1022
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,616
-Thank you.
-I've got it.

1023
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:54,885
(distant siren wailing)

1024
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,927
(meditative breaths)

1025
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,315

(Tár mimicking chiming)

1031
00:57:10,861 --> 00:57:12,830
(plays two notes
matching bell chime)

1032
00:57:12,863 --> 00:57:15,399
(Tár mimics chiming)

1033
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,648
(exhales)

1034

1042
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:28,272
(sighs)

1043
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:46,523
(sighs)

Symphony No. 5 Trauermarsch)

1047

(tempo slows)

1048
00:59:38,008 --> 00:59:40,277
Okay. Uh...

1049
00:59:41,779 --> 00:59:43,013
 <i>Gut, gut.</i> 

1050
00:59:43,047 --> 00:59:45,015

... Christian...
(continues speaking German)

1052
00:59:52,189 --> 00:59:53,891
Okay?

1053
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:56,026
Uh, but it's also...

1054
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,227
It's like we're hearing it

1055
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,864
from a very, very great
distance.

1056
00:59:59,897 --> 01:00:05,269
So it's... (vocalizing)

1057
01:00:05,302 --> 01:00:06,503
Ju... Uh...

1058
01:00:06,536 --> 01:00:08,205
Sorry. <i>Ist</i> Harald <i>da?</i> 

1059
01:00:08,238 --> 01:00:09,606
(Harald speaks German)

1060

(speaks German)

1061
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:13,110
Harald? I was just wondering
if you might, um,

1062
01:00:13,143 --> 01:00:15,713
uh, quickly rig something up
for us?

1063
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:18,749

(cymbals crash,
orchestra ends with flourish)

1067
01:00:46,677 --> 01:00:48,645
 <i>Gut, gut, gut.</i> (speaks German)

1068
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,915
-Harald?
-(Harald speaks German)

1069
01:00:50,948 --> 01:00:52,850
Uh, we'll want the same
backstage setup

1070
01:00:52,883 --> 01:00:54,051
for the live recording.

1071
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,953
(quietly):
One, two, one.

01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:58,789

jaunty classical music)

1073

(speaking German)

1075
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:26,483
Okay? Looks great, but...
(clears throat)

1076
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,985
... we need to hear it.

1077
01:01:28,018 --> 01:01:30,755
Okay? It's not...
(vocalizing)

1078
01:01:30,788 --> 01:01:32,089
(vocalizing intensifies)

1079
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:33,323
Hey.

1080
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:34,725
-(speaking low)
-(snaps fingers)

1081
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,626

 <i>Ja?</i> (whooshes)

1083
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:44,401
Okay? (puffing)

1084
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:47,805

1086

No. (speaks German)

1087

Bah! (exhales)

1088
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:03,587
It's-it's much too slow.

1089
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:06,490
(speaking German)

1090
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,129
(plays sharp chords)

1091
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:13,798
Mm-hmm.

1092
01:02:13,831 --> 01:02:16,000
Okay.

1093
01:02:16,033 --> 01:02:17,701
Okay, tutti.

1094
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,203
Uh...

1095
01:02:19,236 --> 01:02:21,205
(speaking German)

1096
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,407
How are things feeling up here?

1097
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,641
Fine, yeah.

1098
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:26,443
Yeah, actually great, but, uh,

1099
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:28,745
it's a shame we don't record
this one direct-to-disk.

1100
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:31,681
(groans): Oh. It's criminal,
is more like it.

1101
01:02:32,716 --> 01:02:34,451
Will you shoot me the MP3s?

1102
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,286
Yeah, sure,
but don't you want WAV files?

1103
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:39,924
No, just think what people
will actually be streaming.

1104
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,225
Uh, what about video?

1105
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:43,193
Yes, yes.
Uh, stage left A camera.

1106
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:44,661
-Okay.
-All right. Thanks, guys.

1107
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,330
Okay. Uh, bye.
You're quite welcome.

1108
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:48,632
(speaking German)

1109
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:50,100
-SHARON: There?
-TÁR: Yeah.

1110
01:02:50,134 --> 01:02:51,936
You want us to come,
to come in stronger there?

1111
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,437
-FRANCESCA: Okay, then yeah.
-TÁR: Yeah.

1112
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,939
Here, 'cause the reigning
dynamic is forte,

1113
01:02:54,972 --> 01:02:56,540
-which is not good.
-(Sebastian clears throat)

1114
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:58,075
-FRANCESCA: Hmm.
-TÁR: Yeah?

1115
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,378
(whispering): Yeah. Um, just
one small thing, Maestro.

1116
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:04,048
During the scherzo, um,

1117
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:07,417
th-th-the clarinet solo's
still a bit too loud.

1118
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:09,453
It should really be
an accompanying figure

1119
01:03:09,486 --> 01:03:12,522
-to the first violins.
-TÁR: Hmm.

1120
01:03:12,556 --> 01:03:16,026
But apart from that, I'd say
we're in very good shape.

1121
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,694
Thank you, Sebastian.

1122
01:03:17,727 --> 01:03:19,930
Thank you. (clears throat)

1123
01:03:25,235 --> 01:03:26,904
Accurate assessment?

1124
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:28,705
I don't think so.

1125
01:03:28,738 --> 01:03:31,976
The clarinet is marked piano,
and we are marked pianissimo.

1126
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:34,078
Sebastian likes to sit
in the stalls,

1127
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:37,581
but there's no problem
with the balance in the circle.

1128
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:39,583
TÁR:
Mm-hmm.

1129
01:03:40,784 --> 01:03:42,252
Mm-hmm.

1130
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:44,321
Something a bit more playful.

1131
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:45,856
Mm-hmm.

1132
01:03:49,793 --> 01:03:52,129
Oh, and here's something
Tanya and I did with Gustavo.

1133
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:53,730
I think it's very powerful.

1134
01:03:53,763 --> 01:03:55,933
Yes, it's-it's really wonderful
work, uh, Karl.

1135
01:03:55,966 --> 01:03:57,767
I'm just wondering
if we might try something

1136
01:03:57,801 --> 01:04:00,905
a little less, uh, considered.

1137
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,010
Something simple like this?

1138
01:04:06,043 --> 01:04:07,377
Hmm?

1139
01:04:07,411 --> 01:04:09,813
I'm not sure how you would
want to light it.

1140
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:12,716
Have Harald dim
the houselights to half.

1141
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:16,320
Houselights down half, please.

1142
01:04:19,957 --> 01:04:21,791
KARL:
I mean, we could make it work,

1143
01:04:21,825 --> 01:04:23,493
but we'd have to bring in
some lights.

1144
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:25,562
TANYA:
Mm-hmm.

1145
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:30,134
KARL: If we want to do
something like this,

1146
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,469
uh, we'll have to bring
the hot lights

1147
01:04:32,502 --> 01:04:34,538
next week, Tanya--
forget about the strobes.

1148
01:04:34,571 --> 01:04:36,840
-TANYA: Hmm.
-(departing footsteps)

1149
01:04:37,641 --> 01:04:39,109
TÁR:
Thank you for waiting.

1150
01:04:39,143 --> 01:04:40,710
Of course, Maestro.

1151
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:43,813
How are we feeling
about today's rehearsal?

1152
01:04:43,847 --> 01:04:47,517
Well, Sebastian thinks
your solo in the scherzo

1153
01:04:47,551 --> 01:04:49,853
is, uh, a bit loud.

1154
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,055
It's possible.

1155
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:52,923
Hmm. I don't agree.

1156
01:04:52,957 --> 01:04:56,193
Your dynamic marking is higher
than that of the first violin.

1157
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,627
Yes, that's true.

1158
01:04:57,661 --> 01:04:59,429
(sighs heavily) Look.

1159
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:03,200
Sebastian's getting old, Knut.

1160
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,834
I'm rotating him out.

1161
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:07,871
You're the first to know.

1162
01:05:10,941 --> 01:05:13,110
Well...

1163
01:05:14,979 --> 01:05:18,315
Then I will organize a caucus,
and we'll take a vote.

1164
01:05:18,348 --> 01:05:21,285
No. No, you won't.

1165
01:05:21,318 --> 01:05:23,753
A vote must be taken.

1166
01:05:23,787 --> 01:05:25,922
I am familiar with
the electoral conclave.

1167
01:05:25,956 --> 01:05:28,192
But the appointment
of the assistant conductor

1168
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,694
is entirely my decision.

1169
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:32,296
(Knut inhales deeply)

1170
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:33,730
Yes.

1171
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:37,001
So, I can count on your
support with the others?

1172
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:38,935
(chuckles softly)

1173
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,204
Yes.

1174
01:05:40,237 --> 01:05:41,571
Good.

1175
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:42,806
Who will you replace him with?

1176
01:05:42,839 --> 01:05:44,841
Oh. I'm considering a few names,

1177
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:47,911
but the main thing is we
proceed with this immediately.

1178
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:50,247
KNUT:
I understand.

1179
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,682
Maestro, uh, the other players
would like to know

1180
01:05:52,716 --> 01:05:54,318
if you have chosen
the companion piece.

1181
01:05:54,351 --> 01:05:56,120
 <i>Ach!</i> 

1182
01:05:58,255 --> 01:05:59,956
KNUT:
Okay. <i>Danke.</i> 

1183
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,771
(panting)

1184
01:06:24,248 --> 01:06:25,949
(short whistle)

1185
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:27,751
Oh.

1186
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:30,220
-I...
-It's okay.

1187
01:06:30,254 --> 01:06:31,888
 <i>Danke.</i> 

1188
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,573
(playing simple melody)

1189
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:56,613
(light knocking)

1190
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:03,220
* Changing major to minor.

1191
01:07:04,488 --> 01:07:06,490
(Francesca clears her throat)

1192
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,792
Uh, I'm sorry, I knocked.

1193
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:13,130
I knew you wanted your keys
back as quickly as possible.

1194
01:07:13,163 --> 01:07:14,464
Yes, thanks.

1195
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:16,200
Did you use the company card?

1196
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:17,367
Yeah.

1197
01:07:17,401 --> 01:07:18,868
We can use it for your, um...

1198
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,937
(clears throat)
... your taxi home.

1199
01:07:25,242 --> 01:07:27,077
Yeah. It's all right.

1200
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:28,978
You can go.

1201
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:33,650
Uh, it wasn't just the keys.

1202
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:39,256
I-I need someone to hold me.

1203
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:43,927
This isn't the place, Francesca.

1204
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:47,597
You're... (stammers)
That's not about...

1205
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,032
(sniffles)

1206
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:50,967
I just...

1207
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:54,238
I just got this from someone
over at Accordion.

1208
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:58,608
(breath trembling)

1209
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:07,784
Oh, no.

1210
01:08:07,817 --> 01:08:10,086
(Francesca's breath trembles)

1211
01:08:10,120 --> 01:08:11,955
(sighs):
When did this happen?

1212
01:08:11,988 --> 01:08:14,090
Day before yesterday.

1213
01:08:15,859 --> 01:08:19,263
That email she sent you,
it felt like she was already...

1214
01:08:19,296 --> 01:08:22,266
Delete it. And the rest.

1215
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:25,569
There's no reason to get
caught up in any intrigue.

1216
01:08:26,603 --> 01:08:29,206
(sniffles)

1217
01:08:29,239 --> 01:08:30,574
(crying)

1218
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,342
Now, now.

1219
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:38,782
Come on. There's nothing
we could have done to stop her.

1220
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:41,485
She wasn't one of us.

1221
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:43,753
(crying continues)

1222
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:54,864
(sniffles)

1223
01:08:56,833 --> 01:09:00,504
I can't stop thinking about
our trip up the Ucayali.

1224
01:09:00,537 --> 01:09:01,938
TÁR:
Hmm.

1225
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,973
-The three of us were so close.
-Yes.

1226
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:07,311
But that was before
she started making demands.

1227
01:09:09,179 --> 01:09:14,218
There was just something
not quite right about her.

1228
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,720
She had so much promise.

1229
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:18,522
She did.

1230
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,524
Yes.

1231
01:09:20,557 --> 01:09:22,892
Almost as much as you.

1232
01:09:26,896 --> 01:09:30,133
Now, we have to forget
about her.

1233
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,705
You understand?

1234
01:09:40,577 --> 01:09:42,679
-Right?
-(sniffles)

1235
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,583
-I'm sorry.
-No.

1236
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:47,984
I know you're working.

1237
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,619
-Oh.
-(sniffles)

1238
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:50,987
Your... (sniffles)

1239
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,990
Your keys are on
the kitchen table.

1240
01:10:35,365 --> 01:10:37,166
(inhales sharply)

1241
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:57,421
(gentle melody plays)

1242
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:00,256
SHARON:
She went straight to sleep.

1243
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,826
(liquid pouring)

1244
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:05,228
Didn't even have
to hold her foot.

1245
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:13,269
And she came home
in a much better mood.

1246
01:11:13,303 --> 01:11:15,171
Oh, attagirl.

1247
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,240
*

1248
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:22,145
(Sharon sighs)

1249
01:11:24,681 --> 01:11:26,683
Met the new cellist today.

1250
01:11:26,716 --> 01:11:29,353
Oh, what was that like?

1251
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:31,655
Olga Metkina.

1252
01:11:31,688 --> 01:11:33,423
Russian.

1253
01:11:33,457 --> 01:11:35,525
Strong player.

1254
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,794
Good.

1255
01:11:37,827 --> 01:11:40,997
Her facial posture
is a bit much.

1256
01:11:41,030 --> 01:11:42,466
(chuckles):
How so?

1257
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:44,067
Her legato.

1258
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,536
Looks like she's on
the verge of climaxing.

1259
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48,104
(both laughing)

1260
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,042
She is young.

1261
01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54,978
Ah, so you've met her.

1262
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:58,448
No, no.

1263
01:11:58,482 --> 01:12:01,050
Uh, Francesca
mentioned something.

1264
01:12:01,084 --> 01:12:03,887
I think she's arranging
a welcome lunch.

1265
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:08,925
You may want to hold off
on that.

1266
01:12:08,958 --> 01:12:11,828
Her invitation is conditional.

1267
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:17,467
You have reservations?

1268
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:19,403
No.

1269
01:12:19,436 --> 01:12:21,871
Not really.

1270
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:24,474
We need to see if she fits in.

1271
01:12:28,244 --> 01:12:30,514
Did you take your pill?

1272
01:12:31,548 --> 01:12:34,050
No.

1273
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:37,020
Thank you for reminding me.

1274
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:45,895
(distant, rhythmic ticking)

1275
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:10,019
(ticking grows louder)

1276
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,066
(ticking continues
to grow louder)

1277
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,919
(ticking loudly)

1278
01:14:04,207 --> 01:14:06,710
How was Johanna yesterday?

1279
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:09,212
She stays away now.

1280
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,548
You let me know if that changes.

1281
01:14:14,784 --> 01:14:18,522
Petra, last night, you weren't,
by any chance, in my study?

1282
01:14:19,489 --> 01:14:21,324
-No, Lydia.
-Because you do know

1283
01:14:21,357 --> 01:14:23,660
you're not supposed to be
in there without me.

1284
01:14:23,693 --> 01:14:25,194
I know.

1285
01:14:27,063 --> 01:14:28,998
TÁR:
That's right.

1286
01:14:29,933 --> 01:14:32,268
(quiet rattling)

1287
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,538
(rattling continues)

1288
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,610
(sighs)

1289
01:14:40,644 --> 01:14:43,079
 <i>(orchestra playing</i>
 <i>classical music)</i> 

1290
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:03,867
S...

1291
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:06,102
-It's not so simple.
-(music stops)

1292
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,771
It's got...
it's got to be messier.

01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:10,039
(speaking German)

1294
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:13,409
Okay?

1295
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,679
(continues speaking German)

1296
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,654
A lot of pressure. Okay?

1297
01:15:24,688 --> 01:15:27,423
(speaking German)

1298
01:15:27,456 --> 01:15:28,992
-Okay?
-(musicians chuckling)

1299
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,694
S-So familiar to everyone here.

1300
01:15:30,727 --> 01:15:33,663
It really doesn't help you to
know this piece so well. Okay.

1301
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:36,733
Same place.

1302
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,469
(classical music resumes)

1303
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:52,181
(speaking German)

1304
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:07,363
Please.

1305
01:16:07,396 --> 01:16:09,699
-Please, please, please.
-(music stops)

1306
01:16:09,733 --> 01:16:11,768
You must watch.

1307
01:16:13,002 --> 01:16:15,238
(speaking German)

1308
01:16:16,039 --> 01:16:17,841
Okay?

1309
01:16:17,874 --> 01:16:19,208
It's got to be like, uh,

1310
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:22,646
just one person
singing their heart out.

1311
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:27,150
And...

1312
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:29,418
(speaking German)

1313
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,357
Okay.

1314
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,626
(continues speaking German)

1315
01:16:42,999 --> 01:16:44,500
(sighs):
Okay.

1316
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,272
SEBASTIAN:
(grunts) Maestro.

1317
01:16:49,305 --> 01:16:50,640
What a surprise.

1318
01:16:50,674 --> 01:16:52,408
-I was just having
a spot of lunch. -Hmm.

1319
01:16:52,441 --> 01:16:53,777
C-Can I offer you anything?

1320
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:55,611
-Uh, no, thank you.
-(pen clicking)

1321
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:58,247
-Mm, well, some tea, perhaps?
-No, thank you, Sebastian.

1322
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:02,185
You know, I forget sometimes
just how impressive

1323
01:17:02,218 --> 01:17:04,020
your collection is here.

1324
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,122
Is that Kalinnikov?

1325
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:07,824
-Yes. (chuckles)
-Ah.

1326
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:09,693
Isn't he marvelous?

1327
01:17:09,726 --> 01:17:13,096
(laughs)
He belongs in a museum.

1328
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:15,564
I rescued him
for a hundred rubles

1329
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:18,101
-from a Kyiv street fair
back in '90. -Huh.

1330
01:17:18,134 --> 01:17:19,903
Right after the Wall came down.

1331
01:17:19,936 --> 01:17:22,371
(sighs) That must really
have been something.

1332
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,541
-Oh, incredible to have
lived through it. -Hmm.

1333
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:27,911
I'd only just arrived here
with Andris,

1334
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:31,514
and suddenly the impossible
was possible.

1335
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:33,116
Yeah.

1336
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,753
I'd like to talk about that.

1337
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:38,855
-The reunification?
-Uh, no, no.

1338
01:17:38,888 --> 01:17:40,890
But please, sit down.

1339
01:17:40,924 --> 01:17:44,160
No, uh, about the possibility

1340
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:47,663
of you fronting
a subscription orchestra.

1341
01:17:47,697 --> 01:17:49,132
(chuckles):
But I already do.

1342
01:17:49,165 --> 01:17:51,768
Yes, but not as Kapellmeister.

1343
01:17:53,136 --> 01:17:56,439
If not now,
then when, Sebastian?

1344
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,408
You mean leave Berlin?

1345
01:17:59,442 --> 01:18:02,511
Well, rotate somewhere, yes.

1346
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:04,948
But this is my home.

1347
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:08,151
Our only home is the podium.

1348
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:10,453
We all live out of a suitcase.

1349
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:12,722
You know that as well as anyone.

1350
01:18:18,928 --> 01:18:21,530
Just think about it.

1351
01:18:21,564 --> 01:18:23,967
Take your time. Mm?

1352
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,236
It's not something
we need to decide now.

1353
01:18:29,973 --> 01:18:31,540
It's the girl, isn't it?

1354
01:18:31,574 --> 01:18:33,276
I'm sorry, what girl?

1355
01:18:33,309 --> 01:18:35,812
Y-You're not asking.

1356
01:18:35,845 --> 01:18:37,646
You're telling.

1357
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:42,085
I knew as soon as she showed up
that my days here were numbered.

1358
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:44,954
Andris told me not to worry,
but... (scoffs)

1359
01:18:44,988 --> 01:18:46,622
... I knew.

1360
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:50,226
I'm sure I don't know
what you're talking about.

1361
01:18:50,259 --> 01:18:51,627
Oh, please.

1362
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:53,629
Just because
nobody dares breathe it.

1363
01:18:53,662 --> 01:18:55,965
We know the things you do.

1364
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:58,968
The little favors you grant.

1365
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:00,403
I'm...

1366
01:19:00,436 --> 01:19:03,606
I really don't know
what to say, Sebastian.

1367
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:05,875
I mean, you of all people

1368
01:19:05,909 --> 01:19:08,344
have the temerity
to question my integrity?

1369
01:19:08,377 --> 01:19:09,712
No, no.
I-I'm-I'm sorry, Maestro.

1370
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:11,614
I don't, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1371
01:19:11,647 --> 01:19:14,117
No, no, no, it's clear you know
exactly what you're saying.

1372
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:16,419
I mean, if that's how
you really feel about me,

1373
01:19:16,452 --> 01:19:18,287
then wouldn't you say
that staying is

1374
01:19:18,321 --> 01:19:19,622
entirely out of the question?

1375
01:19:19,655 --> 01:19:21,724
No, no, please, Maestro.
Please forgive me.

1376
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:23,059
(sighs) For what?

1377
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:26,662
Your obsequiousness,
your hypocrisy, your misogamy?

1378
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:29,665
-I'm not a misogynist!
-Misogamy.

1379
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,301
It's a hatred of marriage.

1380
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:36,906
Andris is still
very much married.

1381
01:19:37,907 --> 01:19:42,778
And you occupy an apartment
on the same floor, don't you?

1382
01:19:42,812 --> 01:19:46,215
I just don't like
what he's implying.

1383
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:50,253
It could lead to more than
Chinese whispers.

1384
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:52,088
I know.

1385
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:53,589
We barely survived <i>Der Spiegel</i> 

1386
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,859
when you and I
came out together.

1387
01:19:57,260 --> 01:20:01,831
But with Francesca, no one
could point their finger.

1388
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:04,333
It's not like you two are
in a relationship.

1389
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:05,701
Yeah, that's true.

1390
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:08,037
I just...
Turns my stomach to think

1391
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:10,874
the old robot will be right
about something.

1392
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:16,545
He's probably already run
to Andris. (scoffs)

1393
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:20,116
Well, is there someone
other than Francesca

1394
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:22,385
you feel is more qualified?

1395
01:20:24,988 --> 01:20:27,690
There are others
equal to the task.

1396
01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:32,328
Hmm?

1397
01:20:32,361 --> 01:20:34,630
Maybe wait to decide.

1398
01:20:43,706 --> 01:20:45,408
Where are we at with DG?

1399
01:20:45,441 --> 01:20:49,112
-Uh, I spoke to an assistant
in Boyd Muir's office... -Hmm.

1400
01:20:49,145 --> 01:20:51,915
... who said they weren't sure
why they decided

1401
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:55,718
on a digital-only set,
what the criteria were.

1402
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:57,586
-(sighs)
-But I do know they just did

1403
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,255
a full-vinyl pressing
for Long Yu.

1404
01:20:59,288 --> 01:21:01,057
Of course they did.

1405
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:03,292
The Chinese market's incredible.

1406
01:21:03,326 --> 01:21:05,294
All right. Gloves off.

1407
01:21:05,328 --> 01:21:06,662
I'm going straight to Lucian.

1408
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:08,031
Maybe he needs to be reminded of

1409
01:21:08,064 --> 01:21:09,999
his Annenberg
Inclusion Initiative.

1410
01:21:10,033 --> 01:21:11,567
(chuckles)

1411
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,002
You've got
his contact details, right?

1412
01:21:13,036 --> 01:21:16,405
Mm-hmm.
I'll send it to you right now.

1413
01:21:17,506 --> 01:21:21,610
(groans)
My machine's misbehaving again.

1414
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,579
I've already spoken to I.T.

1415
01:21:23,612 --> 01:21:25,848
Just here-- let me borrow yours.

1416
01:21:32,956 --> 01:21:34,790
Thank you.

1417
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:39,662
Where's the matcha?

1418
01:21:47,103 --> 01:21:48,938
(door closes)

1419
01:21:59,182 --> 01:22:01,417
(Tár exhales softly)

1420
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:15,731
(grunting)

1421
01:22:24,040 --> 01:22:26,175
Ah, I wasn't sure
where you were.

1422
01:22:26,209 --> 01:22:27,977
Was working out a kink.

1423
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:30,413
The-the matcha's cold.
I-I'll get another.

1424
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:31,647
It's all right.
I don't need it.

1425
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:33,916
Let's just keep working.

1426
01:22:35,351 --> 01:22:37,420
(Tár clears throat)

1427
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,292
Francesca, you did as I asked

1428
01:22:43,326 --> 01:22:47,163
and deleted any and all
correspondence with Krista,

1429
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:48,797
correct?

1430
01:22:50,433 --> 01:22:53,536
Um, I'm not sure.

1431
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:56,205
Uh, I'm-I'm... I'm not sure.

1432
01:22:56,239 --> 01:22:58,541
I-I'll double-check.

1433
01:23:05,581 --> 01:23:08,551
You know,
Sebastian's leaving us,

1434
01:23:08,584 --> 01:23:10,119
and I wondered if you might, uh,

1435
01:23:10,153 --> 01:23:14,123
compile a list
of suitable replacements.

1436
01:23:18,961 --> 01:23:22,131
Uh, of course, feel free
to add your own name.

1437
01:23:25,234 --> 01:23:27,770
-Thank you.
-(cell phone vibrates)

1438
01:23:29,072 --> 01:23:33,008
Oh, your-your lunch
with the new cellist.

1439
01:23:33,042 --> 01:23:34,110
Oh.

1440
01:23:34,143 --> 01:23:35,544
Meant to have you
reschedule that

1441
01:23:35,578 --> 01:23:37,380
'til after the orchestra votes.

1442
01:23:37,413 --> 01:23:39,482
I'll text her now.

1443
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:43,286
No, wait. (scoffs)

1444
01:23:43,319 --> 01:23:46,322
Might as well
see what she's made of.

1445
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:48,057
(Tár sniffles)

1446
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:52,495
(dishes clinking quietly)

1447
01:23:54,597 --> 01:23:56,832
This food. (chuckles)

1448
01:23:58,267 --> 01:24:02,405
The cucumber salad's,
uh, very good.

1449
01:24:02,438 --> 01:24:04,607
It's kind of the only
real option in this place

1450
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,242
if you're vegetarian.

1451
01:24:06,275 --> 01:24:08,077
Uh, do you eat fish?

1452
01:24:08,111 --> 01:24:09,878
Not really.

1453
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:15,818
You know, we can go
somewhere else.

1454
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:17,553
L-Like the Store Kitchen.

1455
01:24:17,586 --> 01:24:20,989
I mean, it's... uh, it's kind
of a silly tradition really

1456
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:23,126
that new members
are brought here

1457
01:24:23,159 --> 01:24:26,262
to sup with the ghosts
of the past.

1458
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:29,298
I mean, at some point,
everyone from... from Napoleon

1459
01:24:29,332 --> 01:24:33,302
to Beethoven tucked in for
a meal at one of these tables.

1460
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:35,671
Yes, and Clara Zetkin.

1461
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:37,173
I wonder which one.

1462
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:40,209
Who's that?
It's a, uh, musician?

1463
01:24:40,243 --> 01:24:42,010
No. She helped found

1464
01:24:42,044 --> 01:24:45,013
Social Democratic
women's movement in Germany

1465
01:24:45,047 --> 01:24:48,451
and KPD until
Hitler came to power

1466
01:24:48,484 --> 01:24:51,287
and she was exiled
to Soviet Union.

1467
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:52,621
Clara Zetkin?

1468
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:54,056
Yes.

1469
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:56,592
Every March 8th, we place
flowers at her plaque

1470
01:24:56,625 --> 01:24:59,228
in Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

1471
01:24:59,262 --> 01:25:00,729
Her birthday?

1472
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:02,865
No, International Women's Day.

1473
01:25:02,898 --> 01:25:04,933
(Olga chuckles)

1474
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:08,871
-Are you ready, Maestro?
-(pen clicks)

1475
01:25:08,904 --> 01:25:13,209
-Yes, uh... -Yes,
first shashlik, then veal.

1476
01:25:14,042 --> 01:25:16,645
-For you?
-Cucumber salad.

1477
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:18,046
-Thank you.
-Good choice.

1478
01:25:21,317 --> 01:25:23,386
Some more bread?

1479
01:25:23,419 --> 01:25:25,188
Hmm.

1480
01:25:30,259 --> 01:25:32,127
It's good.
Would you like a bite?

1481
01:25:32,161 --> 01:25:33,829
Oh, no.

1482
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:35,798
No. Thank you.

1483
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,601
Have you lived in Berlin long?

1484
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:40,569
No, not at all.

1485
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:42,104
I have friends in Wicker I visit

1486
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,707
-until I know decision
of orchestra. -Hmm.

1487
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:47,510
Simonov will hold your place?

1488
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:50,313
Yes, I think so.
He is my uncle.

1489
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,182
Oh.

1490
01:25:53,216 --> 01:25:55,818
But my dream has always been
to play with Berlin.

1491
01:25:55,851 --> 01:25:57,853
Oh, me, too.

1492
01:25:57,886 --> 01:26:00,122
There's nowhere like it.

1493
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:07,296
I imagine, uh, Rostropovich
is a hero of yours.

1494
01:26:08,531 --> 01:26:10,766
Well, of course, he was great.

1495
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:12,901
We study him
at Moscow Conservatory,

1496
01:26:12,935 --> 01:26:17,005
but growing up, my favorite
is Jacqueline du Pré.

1497
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:19,775
She made me want to play cello.

1498
01:26:19,808 --> 01:26:21,277
Which record was it?

1499
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:23,812
Not record. YouTube.

1500
01:26:23,846 --> 01:26:25,848
Elgar Concerto.

1501
01:26:27,616 --> 01:26:28,917
Oh, of course.

1502
01:26:28,951 --> 01:26:31,654
With Barenboim conducting
the London Phil.

1503
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:34,590
I don't know who was conducting.

1504
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:37,326
But she did something to me.

1505
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:39,194
That's when I decide
to learn piece

1506
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:41,864
and play it
with youth orchestra.

1507
01:26:41,897 --> 01:26:43,766
Quite a challenge.
How old were you?

1508
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:45,701
Thirteen.

1509
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,737
Wow.

1510
01:26:48,771 --> 01:26:50,673
I'd love to hear it.

1511
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,342
They make video.
I will text to you.

1512
01:26:55,478 --> 01:26:58,914
(ensemble playing Elgar's Cello
Concerto in E minor, Op. 85)

1513
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,006
*

1514
01:27:39,855 --> 01:27:41,990
(knocking on door)

1515
01:27:49,932 --> 01:27:52,167
(knocking on door)

1516
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:55,938
-(pounding on door)
-(music stops)

1517
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:16,825
(quiet high-pitched tone
in distance)

1518
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,552
(high-pitched tone continues)

1519
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:55,998
(high-pitched tone stops)

1520
01:29:00,302 --> 01:29:02,337
(panting)

1521
01:29:10,446 --> 01:29:12,881
(orchestra playing
classical music)

1522
01:29:42,244 --> 01:29:44,480
(final note fades slowly)

1523
01:30:01,664 --> 01:30:03,365
Beautiful.

1524
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:09,371
(speaking German)

1525
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:16,111
Now, um, just before we break,

1526
01:30:16,144 --> 01:30:18,180
I know many of you are wondering

1527
01:30:18,213 --> 01:30:21,183
what the companion piece
will be.

1528
01:30:21,216 --> 01:30:23,619
And I have been
thinking quite a bit about it

1529
01:30:23,652 --> 01:30:25,588
and was wondering
if we could just take

1530
01:30:25,621 --> 01:30:29,224
an informal poll about
possibly pairing the Five

1531
01:30:29,257 --> 01:30:32,327
with Elgar's Cello Concerto.

1532
01:30:34,096 --> 01:30:37,099
(quiet murmuring)

1533
01:30:48,076 --> 01:30:50,312
(bows tapping)

1534
01:30:54,583 --> 01:30:57,352
(speaks German)

1535
01:30:58,220 --> 01:31:02,891
Oh, and, uh, given what
we've all been through,

1536
01:31:02,925 --> 01:31:04,627
what we're still going through,

1537
01:31:04,660 --> 01:31:09,197
and we're finally back
together as a family, I-I...

1538
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,400
... I feel that
maybe the soloist

1539
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:15,170
should come from
within our own ranks.

1540
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:16,572
-(excited chatter)
-MAN: Yeah.

1541
01:31:16,605 --> 01:31:17,973
(bows tapping)

1542
01:31:18,006 --> 01:31:19,407
TÁR:
Good. Okay, good.

1543
01:31:19,441 --> 01:31:22,244
Just... Sorry. (chuckles)
One more question.

1544
01:31:22,277 --> 01:31:24,513
And this really is
just for you, Gosia.

1545
01:31:24,547 --> 01:31:26,148
I mean... (sighs)

1546
01:31:26,181 --> 01:31:28,884
... as a practical matter,
I mean, this would

1547
01:31:28,917 --> 01:31:30,886
normally fall to you.

1548
01:31:30,919 --> 01:31:33,589
But given how much is gonna be
asked of you with the Mahler,

1549
01:31:33,622 --> 01:31:35,724
I-I wondered if you'd be
at all bothered

1550
01:31:35,758 --> 01:31:38,326
if we were to hold auditions?

1551
01:31:47,169 --> 01:31:50,606
(chuckling):
Well, that's a bit unorthodox.

1552
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:56,612
But, in theory,
I have no objection.

1553
01:31:56,645 --> 01:31:58,280
My only hesitation
will depend on

1554
01:31:58,313 --> 01:31:59,882
when these auditions
might take place.

1555
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,349
I wouldn't want them in any way

1556
01:32:01,383 --> 01:32:02,585
to interfere with
our sectionals.

1557
01:32:02,618 --> 01:32:04,486
No, no, no.
That's a good point.

1558
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:06,188
I mean, it is gonna
have to be a... (laughs)

1559
01:32:06,221 --> 01:32:07,756
It's gonna have to be a sprint.

1560
01:32:07,790 --> 01:32:09,357
Um...

1561
01:32:10,826 --> 01:32:12,595
How about Monday?

1562
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:18,300
All right.

1563
01:32:21,403 --> 01:32:22,738
TÁR:
Okay, good.

1564
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:26,008
Knut, would you assemble
a quorum for Monday?

1565
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,442
(speaks quietly)

1566
01:32:31,814 --> 01:32:34,583
(quiet murmuring)

1567
01:32:40,923 --> 01:32:43,191
WOMAN:
Let me see what she says.

1568
01:32:43,225 --> 01:32:45,160
Okay, I got, I gotta go.

1569
01:32:46,261 --> 01:32:47,996
Britta, hi.

1570
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:49,231
Lydia.

1571
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:50,899
-Just caught the end.
-Ah!

1572
01:32:50,933 --> 01:32:53,001
What'd you think? How's it, uh,
how's it sounding?

1573
01:32:53,035 --> 01:32:55,303
Oh, it's fantastic.

1574
01:32:55,337 --> 01:32:57,439
I can't wait
until the live recording.

1575
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,307
-Yes, well.
-(kissing)

1576
01:32:59,341 --> 01:33:01,844
I'll be happy when it's over.

1577
01:33:01,877 --> 01:33:03,646
It's always that way.

1578
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,882
I know you're busy, and I don't
want to add to your load,

1579
01:33:06,915 --> 01:33:09,051
but...

1580
01:33:09,084 --> 01:33:11,253
Andris Davis called.

1581
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:14,322
Look, he's upset
I'm rotating Sebastian.

1582
01:33:14,356 --> 01:33:15,891
No, no, no, no, no.

1583
01:33:15,924 --> 01:33:17,259
Something else.

1584
01:33:17,292 --> 01:33:18,661
But you will please
let Laura know

1585
01:33:18,694 --> 01:33:20,062
as soon as you have chosen
his replacement

1586
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:21,263
so she can prepare
a press release.

1587
01:33:21,296 --> 01:33:22,831
Yeah, of course.

1588
01:33:22,865 --> 01:33:24,667
Uh, so what did he want?

1589
01:33:24,700 --> 01:33:26,869
To complain about
the punctuality of a driver

1590
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:29,972
he seems to believe
the board supplies him with.

1591
01:33:30,005 --> 01:33:31,974
Do you know anything about this?

1592
01:33:32,007 --> 01:33:33,441
Yes.

1593
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:36,478
No, it's just... it's just
something I pay for.

1594
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:39,214
Then why does he believe
it's the board?

1595
01:33:39,247 --> 01:33:42,350
Because he needs
to believe that.

1596
01:33:42,384 --> 01:33:44,386
H-He needs to b...

1597
01:33:44,419 --> 01:33:46,755
needs to believe he hasn't
been forgotten, Britta.

1598
01:33:46,789 --> 01:33:49,692
Uh, the academy
has von Karajan's name on it,

1599
01:33:49,725 --> 01:33:52,127
and there are love shrines
to Abbado all over this place.

1600
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:56,732
But the name of Davis, it's
essentially nowhere to be seen.

1601
01:33:56,765 --> 01:33:58,166
All right.

1602
01:33:58,200 --> 01:34:01,837
Then perhaps Francesca could
have a word with the driver.

1603
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:04,106
Of course.

1604
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:06,108
One other thing.

1605
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,976
It's unpleasant.

1606
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:09,344
Oh, is it?

1607
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:11,446
Operational shortfall?

1608
01:34:11,479 --> 01:34:13,849
Must I take Mrs. Sewing
out to drinks again?

1609
01:34:13,882 --> 01:34:15,851
No, no, no, nothing to do
with the orchestra.

1610
01:34:15,884 --> 01:34:18,220
Do you remember
an Accordion Academy fellow

1611
01:34:18,253 --> 01:34:20,723
named Krista Taylor?

1612
01:34:23,892 --> 01:34:25,861
Yes. Why?

1613
01:34:25,894 --> 01:34:28,463
Apparently,
she committed suicide.

1614
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:31,800
Oh, God. Poor thing.

1615
01:34:31,834 --> 01:34:33,869
Her parents mu...

1616
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:37,472
Wait, sorry,
I'm... I'm confused, Britta.

1617
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,607
Why, why were you put
in the position

1618
01:34:39,641 --> 01:34:40,976
to deliver this terrible news?

1619
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:43,278
Why didn't Accordion
contact me directly?

1620
01:34:43,311 --> 01:34:45,280
It's delicate, Lydia.

1621
01:34:45,313 --> 01:34:46,882
Mr. Kaplan thought
it might be best

1622
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:48,283
if you contacted a lawyer

1623
01:34:48,316 --> 01:34:50,853
before speaking with anyone
at Accordion.

1624
01:34:50,886 --> 01:34:54,256
Well, presumably, that anyone
includes Eliot himself.

1625
01:34:56,091 --> 01:34:59,627
I'm, I'm sorry, why-why
would I need to do that?

1626
01:34:59,661 --> 01:35:03,832
Apparently, some accusations
have been made.

1627
01:35:05,667 --> 01:35:07,669
Accusations?
What kind of accusations?

1628
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:09,337
He didn't say.

1629
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:11,706
But they were brought
to Accordion's counsel.

1630
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:14,609
Mr. Kaplan said he's certain
nothing will come of it,

1631
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:17,379
but one can't be too careful.

1632
01:35:24,486 --> 01:35:26,855
(sighs heavily)

1633
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:33,528
(sniffs)

1634
01:35:35,931 --> 01:35:38,500
I'm sorry about the hour.
It's Lydia Tár calling.

1635
01:35:38,533 --> 01:35:41,703
I need to speak to Mr. Singer
immediately.

1636
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,138
Yes.

1637
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:44,940
Yes, it's urgent.

1638
01:36:09,131 --> 01:36:11,366
(low, quiet conversations)

1639
01:36:14,136 --> 01:36:15,971
Tired?

1640
01:36:19,241 --> 01:36:21,743
Sleep's elusive.

1641
01:36:22,544 --> 01:36:24,947
I was the same
before a recording date.

1642
01:36:26,882 --> 01:36:28,650
Lydia...

1643
01:36:28,683 --> 01:36:32,387
are-are you absolutely
certain about Sebastian?

1644
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:34,656
TÁR:
Mm-hmm.

1645
01:36:34,689 --> 01:36:37,459
Who will you replace him with?

1646
01:36:37,492 --> 01:36:39,995
Possibly Andrew Crust.

1647
01:36:40,795 --> 01:36:44,232
He's been assisting
Otto Tausk at the VSO.

1648
01:36:44,266 --> 01:36:46,701
Not the girl?

1649
01:36:52,007 --> 01:36:54,042
(Tár sighs)

1650
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:57,612
Andris...

1651
01:37:00,682 --> 01:37:03,618
... have you ever had an issue

1652
01:37:03,651 --> 01:37:06,188
with a, a student or colleague,

1653
01:37:06,221 --> 01:37:08,490
where that person may have
misinterpreted your intention?

1654
01:37:08,523 --> 01:37:10,058
Has someone been complaining
about me?

1655
01:37:10,092 --> 01:37:12,127
-No, no, no, of course not.
-Because at this point,

1656
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:13,661
they've missed their chance.

1657
01:37:13,695 --> 01:37:15,864
-I'm out of the game.
-Yes, yes, I know, I know.

1658
01:37:15,898 --> 01:37:17,099
Course you are.

1659
01:37:17,132 --> 01:37:19,234
Thank God I was never pulled
from the podium

1660
01:37:19,267 --> 01:37:21,303
like Jimmy Levine.

1661
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:24,940
Or-or hunted
like Charles Dutoit.

1662
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,742
I take it you're asking
for a reason.

1663
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,545
Well, there's just been
so much of this sort of thing

1664
01:37:30,578 --> 01:37:32,214
in the news lately.

1665
01:37:32,247 --> 01:37:35,783
Well, nowadays, to be accused
is the same as being guilty.

1666
01:37:36,584 --> 01:37:38,086
But I suppose
that was also the case

1667
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:41,423
all those years ago
with Furtwängler.

1668
01:37:41,456 --> 01:37:44,526
A bit with Karajan, too.

1669
01:37:47,162 --> 01:37:49,864
Who was the better conductor?

1670
01:37:50,665 --> 01:37:53,068
I never played
under Furtwängler.

1671
01:37:53,101 --> 01:37:55,637
Yeah, when I first arrived here,
the older members

1672
01:37:55,670 --> 01:37:58,941
had, uh, hmm, hushed opinions.

1673
01:37:58,974 --> 01:38:02,344
At the same time, they wanted
to leave that era behind.

1674
01:38:02,377 --> 01:38:03,745
What, the war?

1675
01:38:03,778 --> 01:38:05,247
-No, postwar.
-Ah.

1676
01:38:05,280 --> 01:38:07,415
Denazification.

1677
01:38:07,449 --> 01:38:09,184
Someone pointed a finger at you,

1678
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,319
process started all over again.

1679
01:38:11,353 --> 01:38:13,788
Furtwängler never joined
the Party.

1680
01:38:13,821 --> 01:38:15,390
Refused to give the salute

1681
01:38:15,423 --> 01:38:17,559
or to conduct the
"Horst-Wessel-Lied."

1682
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:20,395
Or to sign his letters,
"Heil, Hitler."

1683
01:38:20,428 --> 01:38:23,431
Even those he wrote to Hitler.

1684
01:38:23,465 --> 01:38:27,936
But he was obliged
to be denazified.

1685
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:30,939
Until then, he was semiretired,

1686
01:38:30,973 --> 01:38:33,475
playing corpses.

1687
01:38:34,276 --> 01:38:36,444
Playing corpses?

1688
01:38:36,478 --> 01:38:39,781
Secretly performing
in a graveyard.

1689
01:38:41,149 --> 01:38:43,618
You're not equating
sexual impropriety

1690
01:38:43,651 --> 01:38:45,887
with being an accused Nazi?

1691
01:38:46,721 --> 01:38:48,390
Either way, you had to be ready.

1692
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:51,359
For years, I made sure
all the hangers in my closet

1693
01:38:51,393 --> 01:38:53,595
were facing the same direction.

1694
01:39:04,006 --> 01:39:07,042
How many are auditioning
on Monday?

1695
01:39:11,313 --> 01:39:12,847
No one.

1696
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:15,450
No one?

1697
01:39:17,019 --> 01:39:19,487
Maybe Martin.

1698
01:39:19,521 --> 01:39:21,156
He's never gotten along
with Gosia.

1699
01:39:21,189 --> 01:39:23,958
He would love to sit downstage
for once.

1700
01:39:25,493 --> 01:39:27,962
Well...

1701
01:39:27,996 --> 01:39:30,465
he's still gonna
have to audition.

1702
01:39:32,267 --> 01:39:34,236
Of course.

1703
01:39:34,269 --> 01:39:36,504
Have to follow the rules.

1704
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:40,808
TÁR: Aren't we being
a bit formal, Francesca?

1705
01:39:40,842 --> 01:39:43,478
From what I understand,
there's only one player, right?

1706
01:39:43,511 --> 01:39:46,214
FRANCESCA:
No, Maestro, there are two.

1707
01:39:47,782 --> 01:39:51,019
(cello and piano playing
dramatic classical music)

1708
01:40:09,171 --> 01:40:12,607
(cello playing Elgar's Cello
Concerto in E minor, Op. 85)

1709
01:40:41,669 --> 01:40:44,139
(cello holding final note)

1710
01:40:48,610 --> 01:40:50,612
SHARON:
Well, it's unanimous.

1711
01:40:50,645 --> 01:40:53,281
-Number two.
-TÁR: Mm-hmm.

1712
01:40:53,315 --> 01:40:54,716
And we have a problem.

1713
01:40:54,749 --> 01:40:56,017
She's not officially
been invited

1714
01:40:56,050 --> 01:40:58,186
to become a member
of the orchestra.

1715
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:03,024
Well, she wouldn't need to be
to solo for us.

1716
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:05,227
KNUT: I believe the criteria
of the audition

1717
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:07,495
was all section members?

1718
01:41:07,529 --> 01:41:10,132
-(grunts) Then her audition
gets thrown out. -SHARON: No.

1719
01:41:10,165 --> 01:41:12,634
Francesca, please ask Martin
to come back in

1720
01:41:12,667 --> 01:41:14,736
so we can give him the news.

1721
01:41:14,769 --> 01:41:16,971
Wait. Gosia, let's talk.

1722
01:41:19,341 --> 01:41:21,676
Shit! (laughing)

1723
01:41:21,709 --> 01:41:23,077
(whooping loudly)

1724
01:41:23,111 --> 01:41:25,547
Yeah! (continues laughing
and whooping)

1725
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:30,385
I'll confirm solo rehearsal
dates with her.

1726
01:41:30,418 --> 01:41:32,354
Thank you.

1727
01:41:32,387 --> 01:41:34,556
Have a seat.

1728
01:41:38,826 --> 01:41:40,862
(sighs):
I have made a decision

1729
01:41:40,895 --> 01:41:43,665
regarding Sebastian's
replacement.

1730
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:48,336
And I want you to know
it wasn't an easy one.

1731
01:41:49,871 --> 01:41:54,342
Uh, this position brings with it
enormous responsibility,

1732
01:41:54,376 --> 01:41:57,545
-and my personal affection
for you aside... -(scoffs)

1733
01:41:57,579 --> 01:42:02,684
... I will have to go with
someone more, more experienced.

1734
01:42:17,765 --> 01:42:20,001
(quiet high-pitched tone)

1735
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:27,074
(tone stops)

1736
01:42:42,857 --> 01:42:45,092
(playing simple melody)

1737
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,237
(bell chiming in distance)

1738
01:42:59,307 --> 01:43:02,477
-(knocking on door)
-(plays note)

1739
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:04,512
Oh, leave me alone.

1740
01:43:04,546 --> 01:43:06,914
I don't have your paper.

1741
01:43:07,715 --> 01:43:09,717
I've told you before, I...

1742
01:43:09,751 --> 01:43:11,953
Oh, I'm sorry. Please come in.

1743
01:43:16,691 --> 01:43:18,092
(sighs)

1744
01:43:18,125 --> 01:43:20,362
(playing gentle melody)

1745
01:43:57,799 --> 01:43:59,267
Good. Good.

1746
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:02,136
I-I think the contrast is,
it's much better now.

1747
01:44:02,169 --> 01:44:03,871
-Don't you think?
-Hmm.

1748
01:44:03,905 --> 01:44:05,740
(sighs)
How do you take your coffee?

1749
01:44:05,773 --> 01:44:08,009
Black. Strong.

1750
01:44:09,677 --> 01:44:11,346
Is all right if I play?

1751
01:44:11,379 --> 01:44:14,115
Hmm? Oh, yes,
of course, of course.

1752
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:26,328
(playing gentle melody)

1753
01:45:02,597 --> 01:45:04,999
That's as far as I've gotten.

1754
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:07,034
But it's good.

1755
01:45:07,068 --> 01:45:09,904
Um, this part here.

1756
01:45:13,641 --> 01:45:16,043
Maybe change A to B-flat?

1757
01:45:19,781 --> 01:45:22,216
That's better.
I like that sound.

1758
01:45:23,851 --> 01:45:25,987
Come on. Take a break.

1759
01:45:26,020 --> 01:45:28,155
Okay. (chuckles)

1760
01:45:28,923 --> 01:45:30,858
(door closes)

1761
01:45:40,602 --> 01:45:42,069
TÁR:
 <i>Sharon?</i> 

1762
01:45:45,373 --> 01:45:47,241
Hello.

1763
01:46:02,857 --> 01:46:04,892
Petra.

1764
01:46:16,904 --> 01:46:19,140
(Petra humming rhythmically)

1765
01:46:23,177 --> 01:46:25,480
(rhythmic humming continues)

1766
01:46:27,915 --> 01:46:29,517
(humming)

1767
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:32,420
What are you doing in here?

1768
01:46:32,454 --> 01:46:35,657
(whispering):
I'm hiding from her.

1769
01:46:35,690 --> 01:46:37,124
(whispers):
Why?

1770
01:46:37,158 --> 01:46:40,127
Because she told me
to put my things in order,

1771
01:46:40,161 --> 01:46:43,164
but they already are.

1772
01:46:45,933 --> 01:46:48,135
I can see that.

1773
01:46:48,936 --> 01:46:50,204
Come on.

1774
01:46:50,237 --> 01:46:52,373
They're all waiting for you.

1775
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:55,777
PETRA: I'm going to give
everyone a pencil.

1776
01:46:55,810 --> 01:46:57,078
TÁR:
All of them?

1777
01:46:57,111 --> 01:46:58,546
They can't all conduct, honey.

1778
01:46:58,580 --> 01:47:02,316
(chuckles): It's not a,
it's not a democracy.

1779
01:47:03,985 --> 01:47:06,220
*

1780
01:47:07,955 --> 01:47:10,191

1781
01:47:15,062 --> 01:47:17,298
*

1782
01:47:43,558 --> 01:47:45,593
*

1783
01:48:01,676 --> 01:48:03,110
(Tár sighs)

1784
01:48:06,013 --> 01:48:07,849
(speaking German)

1785
01:48:07,882 --> 01:48:09,651
Okay, uh...

1786
01:48:09,684 --> 01:48:11,719
(speaking German)

1787
01:48:14,088 --> 01:48:15,557
(speaks German)

1788
01:48:15,590 --> 01:48:18,359
-Hey, that's good.
-Yeah. Good.

1789
01:48:18,392 --> 01:48:19,794
-You happy?
-(laughs softly)

1790
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,063
(Tár speaking quietly)

1791
01:48:23,264 --> 01:48:26,167
How long were you acquainted
with Miss Taylor?

1792
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:30,304
Oh, I'd have to double-check
with my assistant,

1793
01:48:30,337 --> 01:48:33,240
but cumulatively speaking,
I'd say

1794
01:48:33,274 --> 01:48:35,743
-not more than a few months.
-Hmm.

1795
01:48:35,777 --> 01:48:38,580
-Thank you for your time,
Maestro. -Not at all.

1796
01:48:39,547 --> 01:48:41,883
-This recording will exist on
a protected server... -Mm-hmm.

1797
01:48:41,916 --> 01:48:44,385
... under attorney-client
privilege with Mr. Singer.

1798
01:48:44,418 --> 01:48:46,087
-Great.
-He will follow up with you

1799
01:48:46,120 --> 01:48:47,989
to help prepare
for the deposition.

1800
01:48:51,125 --> 01:48:52,994
Deposition?

1801
01:48:53,027 --> 01:48:54,662
Yes.

1802
01:48:54,696 --> 01:48:56,530
I assumed you were aware.

1803
01:48:56,564 --> 01:48:58,700
Mr. Singer's office said
they'd been coordinating

1804
01:48:58,733 --> 01:49:00,768
with your assistant.

1805
01:49:00,802 --> 01:49:03,104
Francesca, you'd better get
your pretty little ass to work

1806
01:49:03,137 --> 01:49:04,939
right now.

1807
01:49:04,972 --> 01:49:06,507
(man and woman speaking German)

1808
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,442
The only communication
we've received from Francesca

1809
01:49:08,475 --> 01:49:10,612
was an email to my assistant
in the middle of the night

1810
01:49:10,645 --> 01:49:12,279
tendering her immediate
resignation,

1811
01:49:12,313 --> 01:49:14,048
stating she would be in contact

1812
01:49:14,081 --> 01:49:16,317
when she had more details
to provide.

1813
01:49:16,350 --> 01:49:18,052
What kind of details?

1814
01:49:18,085 --> 01:49:19,654
A new address, I suppose.

1815
01:49:19,687 --> 01:49:21,989
In the meantime,
we've been trying all morning

1816
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:23,725
to find someone suitable
to assist you

1817
01:49:23,758 --> 01:49:25,092
on a temporary basis.

1818
01:49:25,126 --> 01:49:26,861
For now, perhaps
your new assistant conductor

1819
01:49:26,894 --> 01:49:28,495
would be the right fit.

1820
01:49:28,529 --> 01:49:30,965
No. No. He's not available
'til after the live Five date.

1821
01:49:30,998 --> 01:49:33,067
Yes, I'm ready. Let's go.

1822
01:49:37,138 --> 01:49:38,973
I know how much
you depended on her.

1823
01:49:39,006 --> 01:49:40,307
TÁR:
Two-faced little bitch.

1824
01:49:40,341 --> 01:49:41,843
Imagine her hurt, Tár.

1825
01:49:41,876 --> 01:49:44,345
-Don't you dare try to
defend her. -God, slow down!

1826
01:49:44,378 --> 01:49:46,013
She'll come galumphing back.

1827
01:49:46,047 --> 01:49:48,249
-I mean, I've got a dumb phone
like every robot. -Tár, s...

1828
01:49:48,282 --> 01:49:50,484
-How hard can it be to text
all day? -(horn blaring)

1829
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:53,020
-(screams) Slow down!
-(tires screech, horn honks)

1830
01:49:53,054 --> 01:49:55,356
Or let me out!

1831
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:06,668
(seat belt unfastens)

1832
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:15,176

1833
01:50:16,277 --> 01:50:18,479
-Francesca!

-WOMAN: Fräulein?

1842
01:51:43,731 --> 01:51:45,099
Come.

01:53:21,262 --> 01:53:22,964
OLGA:
Sorry I'm late again.

1865
01:53:22,997 --> 01:53:25,232
TÁR:
Oh.

1866
01:53:25,266 --> 01:53:27,501
(door closes)

1867
01:53:29,603 --> 01:53:32,439
D-Do you live here?

1868
01:53:32,473 --> 01:53:34,976
Not normally, no.

1869
01:53:35,009 --> 01:53:36,510
Uh, make yourself at home.

1870
01:53:36,543 --> 01:53:37,945
I'm just gonna put something on.

1871
01:53:37,979 --> 01:53:39,413
Do you have a towel?

1872
01:53:41,515 --> 01:53:43,885
-(quietly): Yes.
-Thank you.

1873
01:53:48,990 --> 01:53:51,758
I got caught in the rain.

1874
01:53:57,498 --> 01:54:00,601
(both chuckling)

1875
01:54:02,937 --> 01:54:05,406
There is small concert
with musician friends.

1876
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:07,008
You should come.

-You have child, yes?
-Mm-hmm.

1879
01:54:14,648 --> 01:54:16,583
I will not do that.

1880
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,721
Pets are better for some people.

-Oh. (laughs)

1882

Oh, Olga!

1906
01:57:10,924 --> 01:57:12,959
Why didn't you go to the police?

1907
01:57:12,993 --> 01:57:16,029
I fought. He ran.
What's to tell?

1908
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:20,867
Oh, God.

1909
01:57:20,901 --> 01:57:21,968
I'm gonna get you something
for the pain.

1910
01:57:22,002 --> 01:57:23,003
No, I don't need anything.

1911
01:57:23,036 --> 01:57:25,406
No, I'm gonna get you something.

What is it?

01:58:04,511 --> 01:58:06,613
Hold my foot.

1921
01:58:14,755 --> 01:58:16,390
Is that better?

1922
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,024
Yes.

1923
01:58:23,397 --> 01:58:25,632
(Petra whimpering)

1924
01:58:30,704 --> 01:58:33,106
(instruments warming up)

1925
01:58:51,192 --> 01:58:53,194
-(instruments stop)
-(quiet murmuring)

1926
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:01,134
Okay.

1927
01:59:01,168 --> 01:59:03,837
Let's, uh, shoo the elephant
from the room.

1928
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:07,708
"What the hell happened
to her face?"

1929
01:59:07,741 --> 01:59:10,177
"Did she, uh, schedule
a nose and eye job

1930
01:59:10,211 --> 01:59:12,713
and bail before the surgeon
finished the other half?"

1931
01:59:12,746 --> 01:59:14,080
(quiet chuckling)

1932
01:59:18,051 --> 01:59:19,853
No.

1933
01:59:19,886 --> 01:59:21,555
I was, uh, I was attacked.

1934
01:59:21,588 --> 01:59:23,857
Thank you.

1935
01:59:23,890 --> 01:59:26,059
I'm fine. Really.

1936
01:59:26,092 --> 01:59:27,828
-Should've seen the other guy.
-(quiet laughter)

1937
01:59:27,861 --> 01:59:28,829
All right.

1938
01:59:28,862 --> 01:59:31,097
(speaking German)

1939
01:59:35,001 --> 01:59:36,102
(coughs)

1940
01:59:37,271 --> 01:59:38,772
(exhales sharply)

1941
01:59:40,307 --> 01:59:43,277
(orchestra begins playing
light classical music)

1942
01:59:59,125 --> 02:00:00,894
-(grunts)
-(orchestra plays deep note)

1943
02:00:02,363 --> 02:00:03,397
(grunts fiercely)

1944
02:00:03,430 --> 02:00:06,132
(orchestra playing
dramatic music)

1945
02:00:14,241 --> 02:00:15,642
(gasps) Don't.

1946
02:00:15,676 --> 02:00:17,544
It burns.

1947
02:00:17,578 --> 02:00:19,713
You must see the doctor.

1948
02:00:19,746 --> 02:00:21,648
He's booked 'til next week.

1949
02:00:21,682 --> 02:00:22,983
(scoffs) I'll call them again

1950
02:00:23,016 --> 02:00:24,451
and tell them how much pain
you're in.

1951
02:00:24,485 --> 02:00:27,153
No, no, let's just,
let's just finish up here.

1952
02:00:27,187 --> 02:00:28,722
Okay?

1953
02:00:28,755 --> 02:00:30,791
Overall, the balance
feels right.

1954
02:00:30,824 --> 02:00:32,158
Other than a quick brushup,

1955
02:00:32,192 --> 02:00:34,661
we should concentrate
on the Elgar.

1956
02:00:34,695 --> 02:00:37,464
You're certain of that?

1957
02:00:37,498 --> 02:00:39,933
I think so. Yes.

1958
02:00:39,966 --> 02:00:41,602
TÁR: <i>We're absolutely</i>
 <i>rock-solid there,</i> 

1959
02:00:41,635 --> 02:00:46,440
but I am going to try
to hold them back here.

1960
02:00:46,473 --> 02:00:48,442
Uh, they're just
getting caught up in the power

1961
02:00:48,475 --> 02:00:52,379
of your, uh, glissando
in there, trying to match it.

1962
02:00:52,413 --> 02:00:55,282
Um, probably...

1963
02:00:55,316 --> 02:00:57,851
Where were you attacked,
Maestro?

1964
02:00:57,884 --> 02:01:00,954
Oh, doesn't matter.

1965
02:01:00,987 --> 02:01:02,756
(chuckles) Here.

1966
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:05,859
(chuckles) Thank you.

1967
02:01:05,892 --> 02:01:07,628
There you are.

1968
02:01:08,395 --> 02:01:10,864
-When did this fall happen?
-Uh, it's all a blur.

1969
02:01:10,897 --> 02:01:13,667
Three, four days ago.

1970
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:15,201
It's just my shoulder. Yeah.

1971
02:01:15,235 --> 02:01:18,872
It kind of burns,
like I fell asleep by the pool.

1972
02:01:20,040 --> 02:01:23,076
Okay, you can
put your shirt back on.

1973
02:01:23,109 --> 02:01:24,445
You've damaged some nerves.

1974
02:01:24,478 --> 02:01:25,946
The burning sensation
you're feeling

1975
02:01:25,979 --> 02:01:27,614
is called notalgia paresthetica.

1976
02:01:27,648 --> 02:01:28,882
Nostalgia?

1977
02:01:28,915 --> 02:01:31,217
"Notalgia." No "S."

1978
02:01:31,251 --> 02:01:33,720
-Well, how do we treat it?
-You don't.

1979
02:01:33,754 --> 02:01:35,221
Eventually, it goes away.

1980
02:01:35,255 --> 02:01:38,459
An adjustment might help.
You're somewhat crooked.

1981
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,094
(chuckles)

1982
02:01:43,997 --> 02:01:46,232
(piano playing gentle melody)

1983
02:01:56,377 --> 02:01:58,412
(music stops)

1984
02:02:14,461 --> 02:02:16,497
(phone chimes)

1985
02:02:27,040 --> 02:02:29,009
TÁR (over video):
Oh, well, then you must be

1986
02:02:29,042 --> 02:02:32,446
a Negro product
exploited by the Jews.

1987
02:02:33,747 --> 02:02:36,850
Now let's turn our gaze back
to the piano bench up there

1988
02:02:36,883 --> 02:02:39,119
to a superhot young woman.

1989
02:02:40,253 --> 02:02:42,155
That's-that's...
th-that was very good.

1990
02:02:42,188 --> 02:02:44,324
Now, you could masturbate,

1991
02:02:44,357 --> 02:02:48,161
but what are you
actually doing to me?

1992
02:02:48,929 --> 02:02:51,164
(phone chiming)

1993
02:02:53,767 --> 02:02:55,235
-Britta.
-BRITTA: Hi, hi.

1994
02:02:55,268 --> 02:02:58,138
-Have you seen it?
-Yes, yes. I've just seen it.

1995
02:02:58,171 --> 02:03:01,207
... gathering this afternoon.

1996
02:03:01,241 --> 02:03:03,276
-This afternoon?
-Is that a problem?

1997
02:03:03,309 --> 02:03:05,479
No, just...
No, it's no problem.

1998
02:03:08,415 --> 02:03:10,316
(sighs)

1999
02:03:38,879 --> 02:03:44,518
First of all, that class was
conducted in a tech-free zone.

2000
02:03:44,551 --> 02:03:48,522
And second,
whoever violated that rule

2001
02:03:48,555 --> 02:03:51,892
edited what we've all seen
to create linguistic traps

2002
02:03:51,925 --> 02:03:53,494
to completely redefine my words.

2003
02:03:53,527 --> 02:03:55,562
I mean, look at the
reverse shots on the students.

2004
02:03:55,596 --> 02:03:57,631
There's no way that was done
in real time.

2005
02:03:57,664 --> 02:03:59,032
It's a hatchet job.

2006
02:03:59,065 --> 02:04:00,967
I'm sure that's true, Lydia.

2007
02:04:01,001 --> 02:04:04,771
And were it just this video,
we would not be sitting here.

2008
02:04:04,805 --> 02:04:06,640
Unfortunately,
it's linked to an article in

2009
02:04:06,673 --> 02:04:09,109
the <i>New York Post</i> regarding
Krista Taylor's suicide,

2010
02:04:09,142 --> 02:04:12,078
which alludes to
other Accordion fellows

2011
02:04:12,112 --> 02:04:14,080
they claim to have interviewed.

2012
02:04:14,114 --> 02:04:16,082
Laura, can you tell us
about your conversations?

2013
02:04:16,116 --> 02:04:17,417
We haven't had any.

2014
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:19,285
Obviously, we gave no response

2015
02:04:19,319 --> 02:04:21,955
-as we first wanted to meet
to discuss strategy. -Mm-hmm.

2016
02:04:21,988 --> 02:04:24,324
-Here's the article.
-Thank you, Laura.

2017
02:04:26,192 --> 02:04:28,529
(reading quietly)

2018
02:04:28,562 --> 02:04:32,098
"Enticed and groomed
multiple young women

2019
02:04:32,132 --> 02:04:34,901
"to engage in sex acts
for professional favors.

2020
02:04:34,935 --> 02:04:37,704
Blocked opportunities
to those who didn't comply."

2021
02:04:37,738 --> 02:04:40,140
This is total fiction.

2022
02:04:40,173 --> 02:04:42,408
And the <i>Post</i> is
a how-de-do scandal rag.

2023
02:04:42,442 --> 02:04:45,345
No serious person reads it.

2024
02:04:48,181 --> 02:04:51,952
And so far as
Krista Taylor goes,

2025
02:04:51,985 --> 02:04:53,286
she was disturbed.

2026
02:04:53,319 --> 02:04:55,622
I mean, she fixated on me.

2027
02:04:55,656 --> 02:04:57,323
In what way?

2028
02:04:57,357 --> 02:04:58,959
She sent me weird gifts.

2029
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,627
She trolled me online.

2030
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:03,530
-She tried to send me signals.
-Well, what kind of signals?

2031
02:05:03,564 --> 02:05:06,633
She vandalized my Wikipedia
page to say she was my muse.

2032
02:05:06,667 --> 02:05:09,169
I mean,
that's easily checked, right?

2033
02:05:09,202 --> 02:05:12,673
And did you ever report this
or file a complaint?

2034
02:05:14,440 --> 02:05:15,809
No.

2035
02:05:15,842 --> 02:05:18,712
No. And I... Look, I probably,
I probably should have.

2036
02:05:18,745 --> 02:05:21,214
I... I felt sorry for her.

2037
02:05:21,247 --> 02:05:22,749
Is this something
you shared with Sharon?

2038
02:05:22,783 --> 02:05:24,651
No. I didn't want
to burden her with it.

2039
02:05:24,685 --> 02:05:26,887
-Don't you think
you should have? -Yes. Yes.

2040
02:05:26,920 --> 02:05:28,589
Well, what-what do you advise?

2041
02:05:28,622 --> 02:05:30,957
Well, for now, it hasn't gotten
all that much traction.

2042
02:05:30,991 --> 02:05:33,727
None of the trades have linked
to it or called for comment.

2043
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:36,062
-So I say let's see
what happens. -Mm-hmm.

2044
02:05:37,130 --> 02:05:41,034
We wanted to give you as much
warning as possible, Lydia,

2045
02:05:41,067 --> 02:05:43,103
before this Friday's
donor meeting.

2046
02:05:43,136 --> 02:05:45,071
Well, unfortunately,
I won't be there.

2047
02:05:45,105 --> 02:05:47,407
Well, I very much advise
that you are.

2048
02:05:47,440 --> 02:05:49,209
I have the book launch
in New York

2049
02:05:49,242 --> 02:05:51,745
and apparently a deposition.

2050
02:05:52,979 --> 02:05:56,182
Well, we'll fill you in
upon your return, then.

2051
02:05:58,785 --> 02:06:00,520
Enjoy your weekend.

2052
02:06:02,723 --> 02:06:04,925
Starving.

2053
02:06:04,958 --> 02:06:06,693
Finished my thing today.

2054
02:06:06,727 --> 02:06:09,663
SHARON: Congratulations.
We should go out and celebrate.

2055
02:06:09,696 --> 02:06:11,464
I can't. I gotta pack.

2056
02:06:11,497 --> 02:06:13,399
-Hi!
-PETRA: Hi, Lydia.

2057
02:06:18,872 --> 02:06:20,807
TÁR:
Sharon?

2058
02:06:20,841 --> 02:06:22,843
SHARON:
Yeah?

2059
02:06:22,876 --> 02:06:24,745
TÁR:
You seen my performance score?

2060
02:06:24,778 --> 02:06:27,313
SHARON: No. Why?
Isn't it with the other ones?

2061
02:06:27,347 --> 02:06:29,349
TÁR:
No. No, it's not.

2062
02:06:29,382 --> 02:06:32,052
Are you sure
it's not in my office?

2063
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:37,157
Yeah, what about
the orchestra library?

2064
02:06:38,625 --> 02:06:41,327
Yeah, can you
check again, please?

2065
02:06:44,097 --> 02:06:46,599
I don't know. Yes, exactly.

2066
02:07:03,449 --> 02:07:05,919
(whispering):
Lydia?

2067
02:07:05,952 --> 02:07:08,121
(Tár sighs)

2068
02:07:08,154 --> 02:07:09,856
Yes?

2069
02:07:09,890 --> 02:07:12,525
When will you be back?

2070
02:07:12,558 --> 02:07:15,028
The day after tomorrow.

2071
02:07:15,061 --> 02:07:16,897
Will you promise?

2072
02:07:16,930 --> 02:07:19,265
Yes, I promise.

2073
02:07:29,475 --> 02:07:31,878
-Good night.
-Good night.

2074
02:07:46,259 --> 02:07:48,594
Thanks.
Do you have any bottles?

2075
02:07:48,628 --> 02:07:49,996
Of course.

2076
02:07:50,831 --> 02:07:53,199
Do you need anything else
before I close the cabin door?

2077
02:07:53,233 --> 02:07:56,269
Uh, yes.
Uh, we're waiting on one more.

2078
02:08:02,642 --> 02:08:04,310
WOMAN:
 <i>To all my questions</i> 

2079
02:08:04,344 --> 02:08:06,112
pertaining to
your communications

2080
02:08:06,146 --> 02:08:08,648
with Krista Taylor and others,

2081
02:08:08,681 --> 02:08:11,417
your answers have always been

2082
02:08:11,451 --> 02:08:16,222
"I don't know"
or "I don't remember."

2083
02:08:18,391 --> 02:08:19,860
Is there anything
I could show you

2084
02:08:19,893 --> 02:08:22,863
that might help refresh
your recollection?

2085
02:08:22,896 --> 02:08:25,665
Any documents,
such as emails from you

2086
02:08:25,698 --> 02:08:28,068
or your personal assistant,
Miss Lentini,

2087
02:08:28,101 --> 02:08:32,272
that might help you recall
what you did and didn't say?

2088
02:08:40,346 --> 02:08:41,948
I guess you heard by now.

2089
02:08:41,982 --> 02:08:44,918
Bryant Park bumped you
to 53rd Street.

2090
02:08:48,054 --> 02:08:51,291
This is the Kaplan Fund's
prepared statement.

2091
02:08:53,326 --> 02:08:54,795
I'm sorry to say this is likely

2092
02:08:54,828 --> 02:08:56,496
the last time
we'll see each other.

2093
02:08:56,529 --> 02:08:58,664
Well, now I can buy
my own plane tickets.

2094
02:08:58,698 --> 02:09:00,400
And you can bother someone else

2095
02:09:00,433 --> 02:09:04,004
to try and teach you
to crawl to the podium.

2096
02:09:04,037 --> 02:09:06,272
(car horns honking)

2097
02:09:09,943 --> 02:09:11,978
(crowd chanting faintly)

2098
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,218
(chanting continues)

2099
02:09:18,251 --> 02:09:20,486
(car horn blaring outside)

2100
02:09:21,387 --> 02:09:23,857
Is there a back entrance?

2101
02:09:23,890 --> 02:09:28,194
"Indeed, the common metaphors
used to explain music

2102
02:09:28,228 --> 02:09:30,396
"are based on
the idea that music

2103
02:09:30,430 --> 02:09:34,868
"is a language,
albeit a secret one.

2104
02:09:34,901 --> 02:09:40,006
"And in this way,
holy and unknowable.

2105
02:09:41,875 --> 02:09:45,545
"These joyful noises we make
being the closest thing

2106
02:09:45,578 --> 02:09:49,549
"any of us might ever
experience to the divine...

2107
02:09:50,817 --> 02:09:55,788
"... yet something born by
the mere act of moving air.

2108
02:09:57,790 --> 02:10:00,593
No different than birdsong."

2109
02:10:03,396 --> 02:10:05,565
(bell dings)

2110
02:10:09,202 --> 02:10:11,804
So, meet downstairs
in half an hour for dinner?

2111
02:10:11,838 --> 02:10:14,640
Thank you, but I am jet-lagged.
I go to sleep now.

2112
02:10:14,674 --> 02:10:18,744
Yeah, me, too.
I'll... probably do the same.

2113
02:10:38,064 --> 02:10:40,300
(crowd clamoring)

2114
02:10:44,570 --> 02:10:46,806
(phone chiming)

2115
02:10:52,078 --> 02:10:54,314
(phone continues chiming)

2116
02:11:01,487 --> 02:11:03,423
(chiming stops)

2117
02:11:13,433 --> 02:11:15,668
(phone chiming)

2118
02:11:17,503 --> 02:11:18,972
TÁR:
Yes, hello.

2119
02:11:19,005 --> 02:11:21,807
Yes, there's no water
in my room.

2120
02:11:21,841 --> 02:11:24,010
Yes, I've checked the minibar.

2121
02:11:24,044 --> 02:11:26,679
How long would it take
to get a bottle of water?

2122
02:11:26,712 --> 02:11:29,449
Uh, don't worry.
I'll just come down.

2123
02:11:30,583 --> 02:11:32,352
(elevator bell dings)

2124
02:11:32,385 --> 02:11:33,954
OLGA:
Lobby, please.

2125
02:12:00,646 --> 02:12:03,549
(gasps) Oh, Jesus.

2126
02:12:03,583 --> 02:12:05,818
(Tár panting)

2127
02:12:10,590 --> 02:12:12,458
(shudders)

2128
02:12:15,761 --> 02:12:18,431
(sighs) It was Britta.

2129
02:12:19,332 --> 02:12:21,001
Right?

2130
02:12:21,034 --> 02:12:22,935
I mean, that is
how you heard about

2131
02:12:22,969 --> 02:12:25,805
these millennial robots
trading in lies.

2132
02:12:25,838 --> 02:12:28,641
I couldn't care less about
the Juilliard thing.

2133
02:12:28,674 --> 02:12:30,576
TÁR:
Too much time on her hands.

2134
02:12:30,610 --> 02:12:32,145
She's fringe.

2135
02:12:32,178 --> 02:12:34,514
The worst kind.

2136
02:12:34,547 --> 02:12:36,716
Every time
I walk out of this house,

2137
02:12:36,749 --> 02:12:40,286
she's in your ear with intrigue
or she's asking me about

2138
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:43,756
some other piece of fringe,
like Samantha Hankey.

2139
02:12:43,789 --> 02:12:46,859
God, a nobody
who has nothing better to do

2140
02:12:46,892 --> 02:12:51,297
than drop my name at lunch
and imply things.

2141
02:12:51,331 --> 02:12:53,033
I feel sorry for you.

2142
02:12:53,066 --> 02:12:55,068
(scoffs) Save it.

2143
02:12:55,901 --> 02:12:58,438
I tried calling you last night.

2144
02:13:00,373 --> 02:13:03,109
Did you have fun with her?

2145
02:13:03,143 --> 02:13:06,112
My back is killing me.

2146
02:13:06,146 --> 02:13:07,313
Francesca left,

2147
02:13:07,347 --> 02:13:09,849
and I simply needed someone
to carry my bags.

2148
02:13:09,882 --> 02:13:12,085
I mean, who was I
supposed to ask?

2149
02:13:12,118 --> 02:13:15,188
To go with me? Hmm? Knut?

2150
02:13:15,221 --> 02:13:16,722
(sighs):
Jesus fucking...

2151
02:13:16,756 --> 02:13:18,891
SHARON: There are many things
I accept about you.

2152
02:13:18,924 --> 02:13:20,593
-(Tár scoffs)
-And in the end,

2153
02:13:20,626 --> 02:13:24,264
I'm sure I could get over
something like this.

2154
02:13:24,297 --> 02:13:27,200
But that's not what
we're talking about, is it?

2155
02:13:29,669 --> 02:13:31,104
These accusations

2156
02:13:31,137 --> 02:13:34,240
from the parents of the girl
who suicided?

2157
02:13:39,312 --> 02:13:42,082
You honestly believe
what they're saying?

2158
02:13:46,286 --> 02:13:47,920
They're lies.

2159
02:13:49,655 --> 02:13:51,491
Do you understand
what it was like

2160
02:13:51,524 --> 02:13:53,626
to walk into
my sectional yesterday

2161
02:13:53,659 --> 02:13:56,429
and to see everybody
whispering about me?

2162
02:13:56,462 --> 02:14:01,234
It's got nothing to do with
what they're accusing you of.

2163
02:14:01,267 --> 02:14:03,169
It's a simple matter

2164
02:14:03,203 --> 02:14:06,806
of not warning me
that our family is in danger.

2165
02:14:07,573 --> 02:14:09,809
And what good
would that have done?

2166
02:14:09,842 --> 02:14:12,978
I mean, what could you possibly
do to make things better?

2167
02:14:13,012 --> 02:14:15,281
(sighs)

2168
02:14:15,315 --> 02:14:17,650
Because I deserve that.

2169
02:14:17,683 --> 02:14:19,819
Those are the rules.

2170
02:14:20,686 --> 02:14:23,289
You are to ask
for my fucking counsel,

2171
02:14:23,323 --> 02:14:25,225
the way you always have.

2172
02:14:25,258 --> 02:14:27,227
The way you did
when you first arrived here

2173
02:14:27,260 --> 02:14:30,062
as a guest conductor looking
for a permanent position.

2174
02:14:30,096 --> 02:14:32,665
You asked me
what were the politics,

2175
02:14:32,698 --> 02:14:35,568
what were the moves,
how could we swing it.

2176
02:14:35,601 --> 02:14:37,170
(sighs)

2177
02:14:38,304 --> 02:14:40,072
Of course...

2178
02:14:40,106 --> 02:14:43,643
these conversations
took place in another bed.

2179
02:14:43,676 --> 02:14:46,279
Or rather, the couch

2180
02:14:46,312 --> 02:14:48,714
of that horrible place
you still can't let go of.

2181
02:14:48,748 --> 02:14:51,617
Old sorrow blows in.

2182
02:14:53,186 --> 02:14:57,623
How cruel of you to define our
relationship as transactional.

2183
02:14:58,658 --> 02:15:00,593
(sighs)

2184
02:15:00,626 --> 02:15:04,930
There's only one relationship
you've ever had that wasn't.

2185
02:15:04,964 --> 02:15:08,033
And she is sleeping
in the room next door.

2186
02:15:08,067 --> 02:15:11,137
Apparently, this hasn't even
crossed your mind.

2187
02:15:32,225 --> 02:15:34,960
(electronic beeping)

2188
02:15:38,631 --> 02:15:40,866
(quiet chatter)

2189
02:15:48,341 --> 02:15:50,075
(chatter stops)

2190
02:15:54,847 --> 02:15:57,683
(woman laughs in distance)

2191
02:16:12,565 --> 02:16:15,368
(panting)

2192
02:16:16,369 --> 02:16:18,404
(meditative breaths)

2193
02:16:39,759 --> 02:16:41,627
(gasps)

2194
02:16:41,661 --> 02:16:43,363
(exhales sharply)

2195
02:16:44,464 --> 02:16:46,699
(grunting)

2196
02:17:00,680 --> 02:17:02,915
(train rumbling)

2197
02:17:22,134 --> 02:17:23,703

2198
02:17:23,736 --> 02:17:25,805
TÁR:
Petra!

2199
02:17:28,408 --> 02:17:30,042
Come here, darling.

2200
02:17:32,445 --> 02:17:33,779
-It was good.
-Was it?

2201
02:17:33,813 --> 02:17:36,048
-Yeah.
-You want to go to the park?

2202
02:17:36,949 --> 02:17:38,984
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

2203
02:17:39,018 --> 02:17:40,820
Please don't.

2204
02:17:46,258 --> 02:17:48,294
(panting softly)

2205
02:17:56,101 --> 02:17:58,904
(inhales deeply,
whispers indistinctly)

2206
02:18:02,375 --> 02:18:04,076
-(loud knock on door)
-(gasps)

2207
02:18:06,846 --> 02:18:09,281
Hello. I am Anna Franzen.

2208
02:18:09,315 --> 02:18:12,284
This is
my late mother's apartment.

2209
02:18:13,553 --> 02:18:17,222
Oh, yeah, I'm so sorry
about your mother.

2210
02:18:17,256 --> 02:18:19,492
Thank you.

2211
02:18:19,525 --> 02:18:21,427
How's your sister doing?

2212
02:18:21,461 --> 02:18:24,830
Eleanor lives now
in a facility in Neukölln.

2213
02:18:24,864 --> 02:18:26,499
I'm sorry to trouble you,

2214
02:18:26,532 --> 02:18:30,002
but my husband and I
are selling the place

2215
02:18:30,035 --> 02:18:34,206
and couldn't help
hearing the music.

2216
02:18:34,239 --> 02:18:35,307
Oh.

2217
02:18:35,341 --> 02:18:37,009
I'm glad you enjoyed it.
(sniffles)

2218
02:18:37,042 --> 02:18:38,711
MAN:
We were wondering if there are

2219
02:18:38,744 --> 02:18:40,413
specific hours you rehearse,

2220
02:18:40,446 --> 02:18:43,349
so we can schedule showings
around them.

2221
02:18:44,350 --> 02:18:47,119
We don't want to scare
potential buyers off

2222
02:18:47,152 --> 02:18:49,822
with all the noise.

2223
02:18:49,855 --> 02:18:52,425
(laughs):
Oh, no.

2224
02:18:52,458 --> 02:18:53,593
No.

2225
02:18:53,626 --> 02:18:55,661
(laughing)

2226
02:18:55,695 --> 02:18:57,730
No, we wouldn't want that.

2227
02:18:57,763 --> 02:18:59,399

2228
02:19:00,400 --> 02:19:02,435

discordant music)

2230
02:19:11,076 --> 02:19:14,079

* Apartment for sale

2231
02:19:14,113 --> 02:19:17,216
(laughs):
* Apartment for sale

2232
02:19:17,249 --> 02:19:20,052
* Your mother's buried deep

2233
02:19:20,085 --> 02:19:22,622

* Her apartment for sale

* Your sister's in jail

2236
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:30,996
* You put your sister in jail

2237
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:33,232
* You're all going to hell

2238
02:19:33,265 --> 02:19:36,436
* Your apartment's for sale!

Okay.

2254

(speaking German)

2255
02:21:33,919 --> 02:21:35,454
Give me some eyes.

ELIOT:
Lydia.

2259
02:21:48,834 --> 02:21:51,537
This is my score.

-Lydia, you're confused.
-(grunts)

2261

-It's my score!
-(crowd gasping, murmuring)

02:22:08,888 --> 02:22:11,123
(crowd continues murmuring)

2267
02:22:11,957 --> 02:22:14,493
(Tár panting)

2268
02:22:38,417 --> 02:22:41,153
DRIVER:
You sign CAMI voucher.

2269
02:22:41,186 --> 02:22:43,422
(driver speaking into phone
in Tamil)

2270
02:22:52,331 --> 02:22:54,566
(pile driver rattling
and thumping)

2271
02:23:01,841 --> 02:23:03,008
(phone rings in distance)

2272
02:23:03,042 --> 02:23:05,577
MAN:
Good afternoon. CAMI.

2273
02:23:05,611 --> 02:23:07,179
Hold on.

2274
02:23:08,147 --> 02:23:09,749
CORY:
Normally, I'd think Lisa Rich

2275
02:23:09,782 --> 02:23:12,384
in our booking department
would be a great fit for you,

2276
02:23:12,417 --> 02:23:14,620
but she's just got
too much on her plate.

2277
02:23:14,654 --> 02:23:18,257
So, I'd like to team you
with Jake here.

2278
02:23:18,290 --> 02:23:20,826
Jake, you want to,
you want to show Lydia

2279
02:23:20,860 --> 02:23:22,227
what you've prepared for her?

2280
02:23:22,261 --> 02:23:24,797
Well...

2281
02:23:24,830 --> 02:23:27,199
right now it's a reset.

2282
02:23:27,232 --> 02:23:29,001
What we're after is less,
not more.

2283
02:23:29,034 --> 02:23:30,235
We want to be selective

2284
02:23:30,269 --> 02:23:32,271
and rebuild this
from the ground up.

2285
02:23:32,304 --> 02:23:34,273
That means we need a new story.

2286
02:23:38,844 --> 02:23:40,646
TÁR:
Just here.

2287
02:23:40,680 --> 02:23:42,347
Here. Thank you.

2288
02:23:42,381 --> 02:23:44,216
(clears throat) Make it 40.

2289
02:23:44,249 --> 02:23:45,851
Thank you.

2290
02:23:53,893 --> 02:23:56,128
(sighs)

2291
02:24:05,070 --> 02:24:07,306
(piano plays note)

2292
02:24:08,307 --> 02:24:10,542
(piano playing discordant notes)

2293
02:24:14,646 --> 02:24:16,682
(music stops)

2294
02:24:53,318 --> 02:24:55,554
(sighs)

2295
02:25:00,826 --> 02:25:03,262
(orchestra playing
lively classical music over TV)

2296
02:25:18,110 --> 02:25:19,511
(music ends)

2297
02:25:19,544 --> 02:25:21,313
(over TV):
Didn't you feel triumphant?

2298
02:25:21,346 --> 02:25:23,582
(applause over TV)

2299
02:25:24,984 --> 02:25:28,720
Now we can really understand
what the meaning of music is.

2300
02:25:28,754 --> 02:25:32,825
It's the way it makes you feel
when you hear it.

2301
02:25:32,858 --> 02:25:35,928
Finally, we've taken
that last giant step.

2302
02:25:35,961 --> 02:25:38,630
And we're there.
We know what music means now.

2303
02:25:38,663 --> 02:25:41,466
And we don't have to know
a lot of stuff about sharps

2304
02:25:41,500 --> 02:25:43,936
and flats and chords
and all that business

2305
02:25:43,969 --> 02:25:48,874
in order to understand music
if it tells us something.

2306
02:25:48,908 --> 02:25:52,244
And the most wonderful thing of
all is that there's no limit to

2307
02:25:52,277 --> 02:25:56,681
the different kinds of feelings
music can make you have.

2308
02:25:56,715 --> 02:26:00,619
And some of those feelings
are so special and so deep

2309
02:26:00,652 --> 02:26:03,088
that they can't even be
described in words.

2310
02:26:03,122 --> 02:26:04,456
You see, we can't always name

2311
02:26:04,489 --> 02:26:05,858
-the things we feel.
-(sobs softly)

2312
02:26:05,891 --> 02:26:06,926
Sometimes we can.

2313
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:08,460
We can say we feel joy,

2314
02:26:08,493 --> 02:26:12,231
pleasure, peacefulness,
whatever, love, hate.

2315
02:26:12,264 --> 02:26:14,499
But every once in a while,

2316
02:26:14,533 --> 02:26:17,336
we have feelings that are
so deep and so special

2317
02:26:17,369 --> 02:26:18,904
that we have no words for them.

2318
02:26:18,938 --> 02:26:22,107
And that's where music
is so marvelous,

2319
02:26:22,141 --> 02:26:24,409
because music names them for us,

2320
02:26:24,443 --> 02:26:27,279
only in notes
instead of in words.

2321
02:26:27,312 --> 02:26:28,881
It's all in the way music moves.

2322
02:26:28,914 --> 02:26:31,616
You must never forget
that music is movement,

2323
02:26:31,650 --> 02:26:34,453
always going somewhere,
shifting and changing

2324
02:26:34,486 --> 02:26:38,290
and flowing
from one note to another.

2325
02:26:38,323 --> 02:26:39,791
-(crying)
-And that movement can tell us

2326
02:26:39,825 --> 02:26:42,895
more about the way we feel
than a million words can.

2327
02:26:42,928 --> 02:26:44,629
And here we're going
to play you a...

2328
02:26:44,663 --> 02:26:46,999
-(VCR clicks)
-(whimpers)

2329
02:26:49,668 --> 02:26:51,703
(door opens in distance)

2330
02:26:51,736 --> 02:26:53,738
(exhales sharply, sniffles)

2331
02:26:59,211 --> 02:27:00,880
Tony.

2332
02:27:02,181 --> 02:27:03,849
Oh.

2333
02:27:03,883 --> 02:27:05,084
Hi, Linda.

2334
02:27:05,117 --> 02:27:06,318
Sorry.

2335
02:27:06,351 --> 02:27:08,553
Lydia.

2336
02:27:08,587 --> 02:27:11,090
Ma said you'd be over.

2337
02:27:11,123 --> 02:27:13,458
You must be hiding out.

2338
02:27:14,259 --> 02:27:16,661
Why would I be hiding out?

2339
02:27:16,695 --> 02:27:19,064
Beats the hell out of me.

2340
02:27:19,098 --> 02:27:21,333
None of my business anyhow.

2341
02:27:22,467 --> 02:27:24,937
Lot of loose ends,
you got to admit.

2342
02:27:26,471 --> 02:27:27,940
What do you mean?

2343
02:27:27,973 --> 02:27:30,275
Well, like I said,
it ain't my business.

2344
02:27:31,276 --> 02:27:33,645
But you don't seem to know
where the hell you came from

2345
02:27:33,678 --> 02:27:35,547
or where you're going.

2346
02:27:40,419 --> 02:27:42,654
(woman speaking Thai over P.A.)

2347
02:27:48,360 --> 02:27:50,595
(water runs, stops)

2348
02:28:10,382 --> 02:28:12,617
(traffic passing)

2349
02:28:18,323 --> 02:28:21,060
(rooster crowing)

2350
02:28:21,093 --> 02:28:22,962
(car horn honking)

2351
02:28:27,666 --> 02:28:29,601
May I come inside?

2352
02:28:30,869 --> 02:28:32,504
Thank you.

2353
02:28:34,173 --> 02:28:37,409
(conversing in Tagalog)

2354
02:28:44,449 --> 02:28:46,118
Um, I'm so sorry.

2355
02:28:46,151 --> 02:28:48,753
Uh, we just wanted to confirm
that the composer was in fact

2356
02:28:48,787 --> 02:28:50,822
not flying in from Osaka
to attend the concert.

2357
02:28:50,855 --> 02:28:52,257
Oh.

2358
02:28:52,291 --> 02:28:55,394
I-I must tell you that I-I
looked in the music libraries,

2359
02:28:55,427 --> 02:28:59,364
uh, for her score,
but I-I couldn't find anything.

2360
02:28:59,398 --> 02:29:01,566
-This just arrived.
-Ah.

2361
02:29:01,600 --> 02:29:03,835
That's great. Thank you.

2362
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:07,606
Shirley and Cirio will be
most happy to show you

2363
02:29:07,639 --> 02:29:09,674
-the sights of our beautiful
country. -Oh. Thank you.

2364
02:29:09,708 --> 02:29:11,510
Thank you so much.

2365
02:29:11,543 --> 02:29:13,645
Oh, goodness.

2366
02:29:13,678 --> 02:29:15,547
Thank-thank you.

2367
02:29:21,320 --> 02:29:24,056
(man howls)

2368
02:29:39,371 --> 02:29:41,606
(motor rattling quietly)

2369
02:29:46,711 --> 02:29:50,682
Maybe we could stop somewhere
and take a swim.

2370
02:29:50,715 --> 02:29:52,484
Yeah, at the waterfall.

2371
02:29:52,517 --> 02:29:54,386
But, mm, not in the river.

2372
02:29:54,419 --> 02:29:57,189
Why? Is there something wrong
with the water?

2373
02:29:57,222 --> 02:29:59,891
N-No. There are crocodiles.

2374
02:29:59,924 --> 02:30:01,893
Oh.

2375
02:30:01,926 --> 02:30:04,496
I didn't think
they'd be this far inland.

2376
02:30:04,529 --> 02:30:07,399
They escaped from
Marlon Brando movie.

2377
02:30:07,432 --> 02:30:09,168
Wow.

2378
02:30:09,201 --> 02:30:12,104
That was a long time ago.

2379
02:30:12,137 --> 02:30:13,905
They survive.

2380
02:30:19,911 --> 02:30:22,147
(playful screaming, laughter)

2381
02:30:28,587 --> 02:30:30,822
(Shirley whoops)

2382
02:30:30,855 --> 02:30:33,092
(Shirley and Cirio laughing)

2383
02:30:40,565 --> 02:30:43,802
(men speaking Tagalog, kissing)

2384
02:30:48,173 --> 02:30:50,609
-Lady. Lady.
-(chatter continues) -(kissing)

2385
02:30:52,611 --> 02:30:53,945
Here is prescription.

2386
02:30:53,978 --> 02:30:55,647
-Ten dollars.
-Oh. Thank you.

2387
02:30:55,680 --> 02:30:57,082
(pills rattle)

2388
02:30:57,116 --> 02:31:01,386
Uh, is there somewhere
around here-- thank you--

2389
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:03,288
where I could get a massage?

2390
02:31:03,322 --> 02:31:06,057
Was hoping it might help me
with this jet lag.

2391
02:31:06,091 --> 02:31:08,059
(sighs)

2392
02:31:08,093 --> 02:31:10,061
Hmm.

2393
02:31:10,095 --> 02:31:11,163
Yes.

2394
02:31:11,196 --> 02:31:14,133
There is
the very nice place I know.

2395
02:31:14,166 --> 02:31:15,934
Thank you.

2396
02:31:15,967 --> 02:31:18,203
(relaxing music playing
over speakers)

2397
02:31:29,013 --> 02:31:30,115
Thank you.

2398
02:31:30,149 --> 02:31:32,184
Please step over
to the fishbowl.

2399
02:31:32,217 --> 02:31:34,052
The... the fishbowl?

2400
02:31:34,085 --> 02:31:35,787
Yes, over there.

2401
02:31:41,092 --> 02:31:42,661
Um, I'm sorry, I'm confused.

2402
02:31:42,694 --> 02:31:44,863
H-How does this...
how does it work?

2403
02:31:45,697 --> 02:31:47,899
You just pick a number here.

2404
02:31:49,268 --> 02:31:51,370
I pick a number?

2405
02:31:51,403 --> 02:31:53,004
Yes.

2406
02:31:53,037 --> 02:31:54,606
(chuckles)

2407
02:32:03,915 --> 02:32:06,151
RECEPTIONIST:
Number five?

2408
02:32:11,590 --> 02:32:13,658
(gasps)

2409
02:32:18,663 --> 02:32:20,565
(gagging)

2410
02:32:20,599 --> 02:32:22,834
(retching)

2411
02:32:25,003 --> 02:32:26,371
(groans)

2412
02:32:26,405 --> 02:32:27,972
(panting)

2413
02:32:34,579 --> 02:32:36,815
(music playing quietly over TV)

2414
02:32:43,655 --> 02:32:45,890
(woman speaking Tagalog)

2415
02:32:49,561 --> 02:32:51,129
Good morning.

2416
02:32:51,162 --> 02:32:52,864
MUSICIANS:
Good morning.

2417
02:32:52,897 --> 02:32:55,267
Now, before we begin,
let's-let's talk a bit about

2418
02:32:55,300 --> 02:32:59,003
the composer's intent
with this piece.

2419
02:33:00,171 --> 02:33:02,374
And what she might be after.

2420
02:33:02,407 --> 02:33:04,175
(busy chatter)

2421
02:33:04,209 --> 02:33:06,645
(pop music playing
over speakers)

2422
02:33:21,159 --> 02:33:23,194
-(sighs)
-MAN: Five minutes.

2423
02:33:24,729 --> 02:33:26,965
(instruments warming up
in distance)

2424
02:33:31,503 --> 02:33:33,738
(panting softly)

2425
02:33:35,507 --> 02:33:37,175
(gasps)

2426
02:33:37,208 --> 02:33:38,543
(exhales sharply)

2427
02:33:38,577 --> 02:33:40,812
(applause)

2428
02:33:49,554 --> 02:33:51,790
(applause swells)

2429
02:33:54,759 --> 02:33:56,761
-Thank you.
-(applause fades)

2430
02:34:04,636 --> 02:34:06,471
(mechanical whirring)

2431
02:34:10,875 --> 02:34:12,444
(whirring stops)

2432
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:18,750
(fabric rustling over speakers)

2433
02:34:18,783 --> 02:34:20,552
(orchestra playing gentle music)

2434
02:34:20,585 --> 02:34:24,689
ANNOUNCER: Sisters and brothers
of the Fifth Fleet, it's time.

2435
02:34:24,723 --> 02:34:27,091
I'll keep my farewell brief.

2436
02:34:27,125 --> 02:34:29,861
Never was much with words.

2437
02:34:29,894 --> 02:34:33,832
Once you board this ship,
there's no turning back.

2438
02:34:33,865 --> 02:34:38,303
The next ground your feet touch
will be that of the New World.

2439
02:34:38,337 --> 02:34:40,772
(music building)

2440
02:34:40,805 --> 02:34:42,807
If any of you
have lost your nerve,

2441
02:34:42,841 --> 02:34:46,978
then step away now
