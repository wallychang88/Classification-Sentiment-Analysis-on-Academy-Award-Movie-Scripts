1
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:23,305
'I had dropped out of
law school when I met Eve.

2
00:02:23,937 --> 00:02:26,567
'She was very beautiful.

3
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,990
'Very pale and cool in her black dress,

4
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:33,360
'with never anything more
than a single strand of pearls.

5
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,159
'And distant. Always poised and distant.

6
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:44,421
'By the time the girls were born,
it was all so perfect, so ordered.

7
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,460
'Looking back, of course, it was rigid.

8
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:51,971
'The truth is

9
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:55,720
'she'd created a world
around us that we existed in,

10
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:59,564
'where everything had its place, where
there was always a kind of harmony.

11
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:03,599
'Great dignity.

12
00:03:03,727 --> 00:03:07,557
'I will say... it was like an ice palace.

13
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:14,401
'Then suddenly one day, out of nowhere,

14
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:19,623
'an enormous abyss
opened up beneath our feet

15
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:24,372
'and I was staring into
a face I didn't recognise.'

16
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:33,215
"The basic popularity and appeal of Mao
for so-called American Marxists."

17
00:03:33,882 --> 00:03:36,382
This is supposed to go in the sequence...

18
00:03:36,509 --> 00:03:40,349
in under the sequence
in reel two about South Africa.

19
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:44,232
Um... what we wanna
do is get two examples.

20
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:47,693
But the idea is
his style was Marxist-Leninist...

21
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:49,272
Mao's style was Marxist-Leninist...

22
00:03:49,397 --> 00:03:54,147
but that he was accessible to the lower
classes because of his use of homilies.

23
00:03:54,277 --> 00:03:55,527
An example would be:

24
00:03:55,654 --> 00:04:00,244
"The hardest thing is to act properly
throughout one's whole life."

25
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:04,327
What the hell does that mean?
Or, even worse...

26
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:21,433
Eve, I wasn't expecting you.

27
00:04:21,554 --> 00:04:26,104
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- No, I just couldn't imagine who it was.

28
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:29,096
- Is Joey here? Where's Joey?
- Joey's in the shower.

29
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:32,979
- Can I get you anything?
- Oh, just some coffee, if you don't mind.

30
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,528
No, it's no trouble at all.

31
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:39,362
I think I've found a very
nice vase for the foyer.

32
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:40,659
Uh-huh.

33
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:47,712
You'll probably think it's an extravagance,
but it's not, all things considered.

34
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:52,172
These pieces are
becoming increasingly rare.

35
00:04:54,546 --> 00:04:56,256
Isn't that exquisite?

36
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:01,176
I hope you like it, because it's perfect
for what I have in mind for the foyer.

37
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:04,263
We already have a vase in the foyer, Eve.

38
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,019
Yes, but this will never look right
when we redo the floors.

39
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:10,693
I've never understood
why the floors have to be redone.

40
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:15,112
What? We discussed all that, Michael.
Don't you remember? You agreed.

41
00:05:16,026 --> 00:05:17,486
You know, it costs money

42
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:20,740
to have these things done and redone
two and three times over.

43
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:24,284
But the... It's such a large floor space.

44
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:28,079
That's why we agreed to the paler tones
to make a more subtle statement.

45
00:05:28,204 --> 00:05:29,584
Pale woods would be lovely.

46
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:32,076
I never agreed about anything,
I'm always being told.

47
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:35,594
- I wouldn't put it that way.
- How would you put it, Eve?

48
00:05:35,712 --> 00:05:38,172
First the living room was finished,
then it wasn't.

49
00:05:38,298 --> 00:05:42,048
Then the bedroom needed more work.
Now the floors have to be stripped again.

50
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:45,757
- You picked the sofa, then you hated it.
- It was a lovely piece.

51
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,809
It just was the wrong scale.
This is not an exact science.

52
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:54,064
Sometimes you just have to see it,
then you get the feel of it.

53
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:59,241
- You didn't like that in the bedroom?
- I knew you were gonna say something.

54
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:00,821
I get better use out of it here.

55
00:06:00,945 --> 00:06:04,315
Well, if you utilised it in here,
that's fine. It's meant to be used.

56
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,289
It's just that it was part of what
we were trying to do in the bedroom.

57
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:10,460
It's the shade and the bedspread,
they set each other off so nicely.

58
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:12,710
I thought...

59
00:06:12,832 --> 00:06:16,672
- How much is the vase?
- They're asking $400.

60
00:06:16,795 --> 00:06:20,505
- Give me a break, Eve.
- All right, Michael. I'll return it.

61
00:06:24,928 --> 00:06:29,268
Would you mind closing the window?
The street noises are just unnerving.

62
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:31,431
I hope you two aren't
having another argument.

63
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:32,809
Not at all.

64
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:35,646
Oh, I love that suit. Unique colour.

65
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:37,732
Renata calls it "ice grey".

66
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:41,437
It makes you look very beautiful.
Isn't she beautiful, Michael?

67
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:43,739
- Very lovely.
- I don't feel lovely.

68
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,083
I'm exhausted. I've been running
up and down Second Avenue all day.

69
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:51,160
Oh, wow. Is this for us? It's exquisite.

70
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:54,827
- No, I was just showing it to Michael.
- It's too expensive, Joey.

71
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:57,788
Really? Well, that's too bad.

72
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:02,218
- Eve, let's keep it.
- No, no.

73
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:05,640
Yeah, let's keep it. It's very beautiful.
We'll work something out.

74
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,430
No, I was just carried away by it.
I don't know why.

75
00:07:10,557 --> 00:07:15,057
Guess it's because it's so unique.
But it is an extravagance.

76
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:19,016
I'll just look for something along
the same lines at a better price.

77
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,989
But I have to point out one thing.
This really belongs in the bedroom

78
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,610
because it's too insignificant
a piece for in here.

79
00:07:25,738 --> 00:07:29,118
The shade is just wrong
against all these slick surfaces.

80
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:31,081
- I'll put it back.
- No, I'll do it.

81
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:33,121
I just want to try it in a different spot.

82
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:38,706
I can fix something for you,
something more inexpensive.

83
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:43,005
I've seen some nice pewters.
Um, maybe gunmetal.

84
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:46,591
And I can make the shade
in a smoother fabric, if you prefer.

85
00:07:46,718 --> 00:07:50,758
But we should stick with
my beiges and my earth tones.

86
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:53,099
- "My beiges and my earth tones".
- Stop picking on her.

87
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,774
- Nobody's picking on her.
- She's a sick woman.

88
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,647
- That's great.
- Yes, it's nice.

89
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:07,533
So how do you feel?

90
00:08:07,655 --> 00:08:10,695
I'm fine.
I'm just a little tired, that's all.

91
00:08:11,618 --> 00:08:13,408
- Coffee.
- Oh, thank you.

92
00:08:21,044 --> 00:08:24,054
Oh, I tell you, so many jobs.
It's just exhausting.

93
00:08:24,172 --> 00:08:28,842
Yeah, I know. I can't get over how
you sort of jump right in and do it.

94
00:08:29,344 --> 00:08:32,934
Well, I like it. I like to be busy.

95
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,309
And I think by now
I can say that my comeback

96
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:40,516
is over the shaky period.
Wouldn't you say?

97
00:08:40,647 --> 00:08:44,647
I think so, I think your work is better,
in fact, than it's ever been.

98
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:47,066
- Do you?
- Yeah.

99
00:08:47,195 --> 00:08:51,865
Well, I have to admit that I have received
some rather special compliments lately.

100
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,081
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

101
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:59,292
Yes. Well, my spirits are high.
I'm feeling good about myself.

102
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,498
Not to say that I don't run
into an occasional setback,

103
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:08,419
but I haven't really felt
so confident in a long time.

104
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,010
I can see it. I mean,
you look better than you have in ages.

105
00:09:11,135 --> 00:09:16,635
- Oh. Have you talked to Dad lately?
- No. He's still in Greece.

106
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:20,436
When he comes back, I hope you'll
corroborate the state of my wellbeing.

107
00:09:20,562 --> 00:09:22,442
Of course.

108
00:09:23,273 --> 00:09:26,903
I've certainly pulled myself together
in a way that he never thought possible.

109
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:31,236
- I mean, you're really impressive.
- Oh...

110
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:35,794
Well, maybe a reconciliation
could finally be discussed.

111
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:37,750
Think so?

112
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,040
Well, it hasn't been that much time.

113
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,293
I really don't... I don't know.

114
00:09:50,133 --> 00:09:52,593
Why are you always so negative about it?

115
00:09:52,719 --> 00:09:54,219
I don't think that was negative.

116
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:58,305
Oh, you're always reluctant to
encourage me. I don't know why.

117
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,603
Mother, I know that you're optimistic,

118
00:10:00,727 --> 00:10:03,057
but it's really important
for you to be realistic, too.

119
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,187
Is there something you know
that you're not saying?

120
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:09,065
- No.
- Dr Lobel doesn't think it's unrealistic

121
00:10:09,193 --> 00:10:11,823
to hope that your father and I
might reconcile.

122
00:10:11,946 --> 00:10:13,156
It's just a goal. That's all.

123
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:16,701
Fine, I didn't say anything
to get in the way of that.

124
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,752
You always make it sound
as though it's impossible.

125
00:10:21,873 --> 00:10:26,713
- Mother, I didn't say it was impossible.
- Yes, you did. You imply that a lot.

126
00:10:28,338 --> 00:10:31,088
Renata thinks it's going to happen.

127
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:34,045
- I'm sure she didn't say that.
- She did. She implied that.

128
00:10:34,177 --> 00:10:36,017
- Well, maybe you read into it.
- No, I didn't.

129
00:10:36,137 --> 00:10:38,217
She's just a person
who looks on the bright side.

130
00:10:38,348 --> 00:10:40,678
Oh, great. I think that's wonderful.

131
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,938
I just don't think
you should delude yourself either.

132
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,817
You don't think there's any chance
your father will ever live with me again?

133
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,607
- I didn't say that.
- Renata thinks there's a good chance.

134
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:49,903
Just wait and see.

135
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:51,896
You just refuse to encourage me,
don't you?

136
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:55,448
- Why don't you discuss it with Renata?
- I will, thank you. I will.

137
00:11:28,898 --> 00:11:31,528
Mother paced all the time.

138
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:33,191
She...

139
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,996
She was an insomniac.

140
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:50,344
You could always hear her upstairs,

141
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:55,008
pacing in the middle of the night.

142
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:59,723
But that was more when she...
got back from the hospital.

143
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:08,098
I, uh...

144
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,730
I saw her...

145
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:16,198
the first day that they
brought her back. Um...

146
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,910
She'd had all this...

147
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:24,581
electric shock therapy
and... her hair looked grey

148
00:12:24,704 --> 00:12:28,374
and I couldn't believe it.
It was... It was like...

149
00:12:30,293 --> 00:12:32,753
she was a stranger.

150
00:12:35,006 --> 00:12:38,256
'After that, she was always sort of, um...

151
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:42,604
'coming in and... going out.

152
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,772
'I guess you...

153
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,847
'you never knew.

154
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,691
'Before her breakdown,
she was a very successful woman.

155
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:55,105
'She was very demanding.

156
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,454
'She, uh...

157
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,070
'she put Dad through law school
and she financed the start of his practice.

158
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,449
'So in a sense,
it was like he was her creation.'

159
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,036
We kept getting shuffled
around to aunts and cousins

160
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,377
and I guess
Joey had the worst of it, 'cause...

161
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:21,090
As a kid, Joey was very high-strung.
She was a bright kid, you know? She...

162
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,259
She was very sensitive.

163
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:28,103
'We'd spend some time with Dad,
mostly long Sunday breakfasts.

164
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:31,193
'I always resented
his relationship to her, you know.

165
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,562
'I always felt that he favoured Joey.'

166
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:37,439
It just seemed that they were
very close and that I was left out.

167
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,532
I like Frederick.

168
00:13:40,655 --> 00:13:44,775
He has dignity and promise as a writer.

169
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:48,754
My own strength is visual.

170
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,424
Your images are visual, Renata.

171
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,796
And in all candour,

172
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,510
- I much prefer Frederick to Mike.
- Mike's fine, Mother.

173
00:13:59,632 --> 00:14:03,222
Well, he uses a very strong aftershave.

174
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:07,144
- It permeates the house.
- I don't wanna talk about it.

175
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:11,102
Do you think that if I bought him
another kind of cologne he would switch?

176
00:14:11,853 --> 00:14:15,983
- Can we talk about something else?
- Well, let me give him some.

177
00:14:16,107 --> 00:14:19,107
Then we won't have to talk about it.
It'll just be my gift.

178
00:14:19,235 --> 00:14:21,945
Could we please talk about something else?

179
00:14:22,071 --> 00:14:24,871
Look, I wanna say something,
I'm gonna be very direct.

180
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:28,869
I think the occasion calls for it.

181
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,669
I've done a lot of
thinking about this matter

182
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,882
and a great deal of soul-searching.

183
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:42,552
Now that the girls are all on their own,
I feel that for my own self,

184
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:47,894
I must come to this decision,
though I don't take it lightly.

185
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:55,059
I feel I've been a dedicated husband
and a responsible father,

186
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:59,067
and I haven't regretted anything
I've been called upon to do.

187
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,570
Now I feel I want to be
by myself for a while.

188
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:11,331
And consequently,
I've decided to move out of the house.

189
00:15:11,454 --> 00:15:16,044
I don't know how I'll feel about it when
I finally do it, and it's not irrevocable,

190
00:15:17,084 --> 00:15:19,714
but I feel it's something I have to try.

191
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:26,763
Now, as I say,
it's not an irrevocable situation.

192
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,136
It's a separation.

193
00:15:29,513 --> 00:15:32,813
It may be for the best. It may not.

194
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,267
But I wanted to lay it on the table,
in front of everyone,

195
00:15:37,396 --> 00:15:41,526
so that everything is open
and as direct as possible.

196
00:15:53,204 --> 00:15:55,504
Will you please not breathe in so hard?

197
00:16:02,546 --> 00:16:04,876
- I'll move out.
- What does that mean?

198
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,510
- I don't want to live in this house anymore.
- Eve, think about it.

199
00:16:09,637 --> 00:16:13,137
- I'll move out!
- Look, it's not irrevocable.

200
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,555
It's a trial separation.

201
00:16:16,978 --> 00:16:19,478
I can't be alone.

202
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:24,068
- Eve...
- I don't wanna discuss the details now.

203
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,525
It's a very bad time for me.

204
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,212
My impotence set in a year ago.

205
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:45,973
My paralysis.

206
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,473
I suddenly found I couldn't bring
myself to write any more.

207
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:56,385
Rather, I mean, I shouldn't say suddenly.
Actually, it started happening last winter.

208
00:17:01,856 --> 00:17:06,276
Increasing thoughts about death
just seemed to come over me.

209
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:08,532
Um, these, uh...

210
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,827
A preoccupation with my own mortality.

211
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:22,495
These... feelings of futility
in relation to my work.

212
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:26,166
I mean, just what am I
striving to create anyway?

213
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:29,757
I mean, to what end?
For what purpose, what goal?

214
00:17:32,595 --> 00:17:34,135
I mean...

215
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:40,015
Do I really care if a handful of my poems
are read after I'm gone forever?

216
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:43,154
Is that supposed to be
some sort of compensation?

217
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:48,491
I used to think it was, but...

218
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,700
now, for some reason...

219
00:17:56,827 --> 00:18:00,537
I can't. I can't seem to...

220
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:08,795
I can't seem to shake
the real implication of dying.

221
00:18:11,467 --> 00:18:13,507
It's terrifying.

222
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:22,812
The intimacy of it embarrasses me.

223
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:31,815
What's the matter?
You still thinking about your mother?

224
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:37,492
I can't believe Renata encourages her.
She fills her full of false hope.

225
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:39,828
She's just trying to keep her spirits up.

226
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,752
I wanna quit my job.

227
00:18:49,004 --> 00:18:50,634
Oh, Joey!

228
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:53,796
I can't keep my mind on it.
I can't concentrate.

229
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,506
I sit there all day,
reading other people's manuscripts,

230
00:18:56,637 --> 00:18:58,597
and half-way through I lose interest.

231
00:18:58,722 --> 00:19:00,432
I get headaches from the words.

232
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:02,688
Then I'm supposed to sit down
and write an opinion.

233
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:04,310
It's not fair to the authors.

234
00:19:04,436 --> 00:19:07,566
A month ago you said you finally
found something you enjoyed.

235
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,070
Well, I was wrong.

236
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:13,491
I think about going back to acting.

237
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,953
I'm not an actress.

238
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:21,164
Can't do that again.
Flyn's the actress in this family.

239
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,245
Why don't you work with me?

240
00:19:24,874 --> 00:19:28,134
Because political activity
is not my interest.

241
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,053
I'm too self-centred for that.

242
00:19:31,172 --> 00:19:34,882
That's my whole point.
It would get you off yourself.

243
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:37,549
Sometimes I think if we had a child...

244
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:41,018
Oh, God.

245
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:46,060
I mean, that really makes me anxious.
I mean... it's totally irrevocable.

246
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:50,015
Whatever happened to your photography?

247
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:52,739
You have so much potential.
You used to be so hot on that.

248
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,320
I hate it. It's stupid.

249
00:19:56,113 --> 00:19:58,703
I feel a real need to express something

250
00:19:58,824 --> 00:20:02,794
but I don't know what it is I want
to express or how to express it.

251
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:11,342
It's always so difficult getting Mother
a birthday present. It's impossible.

252
00:20:11,462 --> 00:20:13,592
Please, let's not stay forever at the party.

253
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,224
I really wanna get home
and finish proofreading those galleys.

254
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:20,262
Oh, come on, Frederick, really?
I really... I hardly ever see Mother.

255
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:22,677
I hardly ever spend any time
with her at all.

256
00:20:22,806 --> 00:20:25,246
Besides, it's not going to be so terrible.
Flyn will be there.

257
00:20:25,351 --> 00:20:28,651
Terrific. We get caught up on
the latest Hollywood gossip.

258
00:20:28,771 --> 00:20:32,521
Oh, come on, Frederick.
You know Flyn likes you.

259
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,070
And don't behave condescendingly,

260
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:36,493
because I think she sort of senses
you talk down to her.

261
00:20:36,612 --> 00:20:39,912
No, I don't talk down to Flyn. I love
hearing about her hair and her weight

262
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,952
and the latest piece
of TV junk she's done.

263
00:20:43,077 --> 00:20:45,997
Well, that's her life.

264
00:20:46,622 --> 00:20:49,582
And anyway, you have to admit
she is a sexy little girl.

265
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,338
No, Flyn is the opposite of sexy.

266
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,631
Hey, what about a scarf?

267
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:57,835
Flyn suffers from the same thing
my last book suffered from.

268
00:20:57,967 --> 00:21:02,447
She's a perfect example of form
without any content.

269
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:07,595
That's very profound.
And you haven't even started drinking yet.

270
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,516
I am profound.
But I'm not the award-winning writer.

271
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,936
You're supposed to be
giving me insights into sex

272
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:14,935
and other world-shattering phenomena.

273
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,660
- Really?
- Really. C'mon, let's go, Frederick.

274
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,202
You look fabulous, Mother.

275
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,334
But the main thing
is that you're feeling well.

276
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,674
Yes, but I tire so easily.

277
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,420
Can I help you with something?

278
00:21:31,542 --> 00:21:33,542
Joey tells me that you're thinking about

279
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,749
taking on some decorating
projects again, Mother.

280
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:40,429
Yes, Joey pushes me.
But I'm not going to accept anything

281
00:21:40,551 --> 00:21:44,311
until I'm sure I can maintain
the level that I expect of myself.

282
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,767
Mother, I can't believe this view.
It's just beautiful.

283
00:21:49,893 --> 00:21:52,403
I'm getting used to it.

284
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:55,020
- I miss the sea.
- Yeah.

285
00:21:55,149 --> 00:21:58,569
I can't get over how sexy Flyn got.

286
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,534
Yeah. She looks beautiful, doesn't she?

287
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:05,325
- Your new film is in Arizona?
- No. It's in Denver.

288
00:22:05,451 --> 00:22:08,701
I leave tomorrow morning.
I have to be ready to shoot on Monday.

289
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:12,419
I have so many lines to learn.
But it's just a television movie.

290
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,292
Did you speak to Dad?

291
00:22:14,418 --> 00:22:17,088
Yeah, I've spoken to him
on the phone once.

292
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,760
- Did he mention anything?
- He said he visits you.

293
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:26,261
Just now and then.

294
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,019
Mum?

295
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:35,978
Nothing to live for any more.

296
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:38,936
- Mum, don't say that.
- It's true.

297
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:42,398
You know that's not true.
Mother, look... It's all right, Mum.

298
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:44,949
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. She's fine.

299
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:47,164
C'mon Mum. Mum, it's a trial separation.

300
00:22:47,284 --> 00:22:49,804
Of course it is, Mother.
I mean, we've been through this before.

301
00:22:49,912 --> 00:22:52,042
It just takes time.
Everything'll work out.

302
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,174
Renata.

303
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:58,999
It's her birthday, let her enjoy it.

304
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:01,669
No, I don't think
that's exactly the right way.

305
00:23:03,217 --> 00:23:05,837
- Ah!
- Do you like it?

306
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:08,179
Oh, now, that's lovely. That's lovely.

307
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,465
- That's pretty.
- It's exactly like yours.

308
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,810
Very nice. Thanks.

309
00:23:13,936 --> 00:23:15,936
- Lovely.
- I'm so glad.

310
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:19,903
I hope it fits, I think...
I'm pretty positive it will.

311
00:23:20,025 --> 00:23:24,105
Frederick has finished what I've
already told him is his best work by far.

312
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:25,947
That's what you said about the last one.

313
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:28,913
No, but I really feel
that this one comes off.

314
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:32,874
- I mean, it's terribly concise.
- You said the same thing.

315
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:35,956
- Concise. Spare, you said.
- Well...

316
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,463
You couldn't think of anything
you really liked about it,

317
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:42,545
so you had to call it something.
Concise. Spare. Pithy. Lean.

318
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:45,933
OK. OK. Well, you just can't
handle a compliment, that's all.

319
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:47,971
Guess I can't.

320
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,350
- We gotta go.
- Oh, really?

321
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,432
We hardly had any chance to speak.

322
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,178
I know.

323
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:58,148
So how are you doing?
You seem... You look OK.

324
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:00,322
I'm good.

325
00:24:00,441 --> 00:24:03,821
I read something of yours
in a magazine. "New Yorker", I think.

326
00:24:03,944 --> 00:24:06,534
Poem called "Wondering".

327
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:10,452
- Was very beautiful.
- It's an old poem.

328
00:24:10,576 --> 00:24:15,036
I redid it. And now when I reread it,
I find it much too ambiguous.

329
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,791
Nah, I may redo it again.

330
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:22,963
We're starting our drive back.
Can we drop you someplace?

331
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:26,218
I have to catch a plane
really early tomorrow morning.

332
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:30,891
Oh, right. I heard you're shooting a movie
in the cold Rocky Mountains of Colorado.

333
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:35,643
Couldn't be some place like Acapulco.
That's my idea of fantasy.

334
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:40,063
Lie around on the beach.
Get waited on hand and foot.

335
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:42,979
Really? I can't take Mexico.

336
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:45,858
I always think I'm gonna get shot
just walking down the street.

337
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:48,526
What was that?

338
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:54,241
"Happy birthday. Love, Arthur."

339
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,409
They're beautiful.

340
00:24:57,748 --> 00:25:00,748
I like white roses better than
any other flower on earth.

341
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:03,336
There you are, Mother.
I knew he wouldn't forget.

342
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:05,882
Mum. And you were worried?

343
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:08,756
They're a good sign. Don't you think?

344
00:25:15,933 --> 00:25:18,983
Well? Are you getting dressed or what?

345
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,975
Frederick, are you talking to me?

346
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:26,358
We said everything.

347
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:30,315
Don't blame me.
I've been nothing but understanding.

348
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:34,159
- You don't help by patronising me.
- I wasn't patronising you.

349
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,414
Your work is great.
Who cares what the critics think?

350
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:41,418
That's easy for you to say.
You get nothing but encouragement.

351
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:43,042
You're just their little darling.

352
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,418
They're lenient with me,
obviously, because I'm a woman.

353
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:48,127
No.

354
00:25:48,757 --> 00:25:51,587
- It's because you're so damn good.
- So are you.

355
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,298
All right. I mean, the book didn't get
the response it deserved.

356
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:57,139
I hate to tell you how often
they've missed the boat.

357
00:25:57,266 --> 00:26:00,726
Stop lying to me. I count on you
for honesty, not flattery.

358
00:26:00,852 --> 00:26:04,482
I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
And who cares what anybody thinks?

359
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:05,816
They think what I think.

360
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:09,321
My work once showed promise
and I haven't delivered, as simple as that.

361
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:11,574
Your work's not fashionable, Frederick.

362
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,617
You should be thankful for that,
for God's sakes.

363
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:16,490
I mean, what are you after?
The superficial acclaim

364
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:19,578
of some little book reviewer
in some room somewhere?

365
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:23,915
We've always talked about fine work
that means something in the long run.

366
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,462
I don't care about fine work!

367
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,877
I don't wanna wait 25 years
to be appreciated.

368
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,006
I wanna be able to
knock somebody over now!

369
00:26:31,133 --> 00:26:33,223
They're stricter with you
because you attempt more.

370
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:36,223
Don't you understand that?
They refuse to take that into consideration.

371
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:39,186
Stop looking for excuses, all right?
I'm not writing for a time capsule.

372
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:40,388
They won't give me an inch.

373
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:44,395
And half the stuff that's written,
it's garbage, they praise sky-high.

374
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,950
The baby-sitter will be here in a minute.

375
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,369
I told you, I'm not going.

376
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,577
We can't not go.
What is the matter with you?

377
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:08,049
I'm not in the mood
for your lesbian friends

378
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:11,090
and a lot of vacuous gossip
about New York poetesses.

379
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,184
You stop pitying yourself so much?
It's nauseating. I'm going.

380
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:18,721
Look, why can't you just once in a while
consider my feelings and my needs?

381
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:22,927
I'm sick of your needs! I'm tired of
your idiosyncrasy and competitiveness.

382
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,770
I have my own problems!

383
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,895
Then we have a superficial chitchat
about the nature of poetry,

384
00:27:30,025 --> 00:27:33,025
your symbolism, your imagery,
your contribution to whatever.

385
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:36,993
We never see Marion and Gail.
I don't understand. You used to like them.

386
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:41,865
I can't stand them. They're so enthusiastic.
College kids. I get embarrassed.

387
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,325
Oh, well, don't get embarrassed.
Don't come.

388
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,376
Stay home and drink yourself unconscious.

389
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
That's one of the clichés of being
a novelist you have no problem with.

390
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:51,668
Yeah, I sure can drink.

391
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:54,257
Yes, you're fine as long as
I keep everything going.

392
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,883
What you mean, keep everything going?

393
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:58,640
You're talking about that cheque
that arrives from Daddy every month

394
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,640
so that you can write yourself
into immortality?

395
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:04,354
I also raise the family that you wanted.
Or the family you thought you wanted.

396
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,686
Hey, you made some noises
about experiencing motherhood.

397
00:28:07,813 --> 00:28:10,443
I'm sure you thought
it was great potential raw material.

398
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,775
Well, now you got another human being.
Three of us.

399
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,741
It wasn't my idea, and I'm not
ashamed to be subsidised either.

400
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,913
I turn things out.

401
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,454
Yeah, you do.

402
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,332
You turn things out. You're incredible.

403
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:38,635
Frederick...

404
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:42,223
Frederick, you have so much to offer.

405
00:28:42,347 --> 00:28:45,307
I wanna help, not hurt.

406
00:28:47,728 --> 00:28:52,268
I can't go out. I'm not in the mood.
I'm liable to kill somebody.

407
00:28:56,737 --> 00:28:59,317
I'm going. Bye.

408
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,206
You look as good
as I've seen you in a long time.

409
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:14,335
And in no time at all you've turned
this place into a lovely home.

410
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,295
I saw Joey last week.

411
00:29:17,424 --> 00:29:20,184
I may be working on her apartment.

412
00:29:20,302 --> 00:29:24,932
Mike seems amenable.
He isn't really what I had in mind for Joey.

413
00:29:25,056 --> 00:29:26,806
But I'm getting more used to him.

414
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:30,853
She has no direction.

415
00:29:32,063 --> 00:29:34,613
I expected such great things from her.

416
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:38,198
She was an extraordinary child.

417
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:43,330
And how are you getting along, Arthur?

418
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:46,660
Fine. I'm fine.

419
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:50,667
Busy. It's important to keep busy.

420
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,875
Did you like the Matisse drawing?
It was on sale at Parke-Bernet.

421
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:58,674
Oh, yes. It's lovely.

422
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,429
So delicate.

423
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,062
Well...

424
00:30:09,226 --> 00:30:11,096
We'll talk, Eve.

425
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:14,900
Good night.

426
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:40,246
She's got to go back to the sanatorium,
for a while at least.

427
00:32:40,377 --> 00:32:43,047
Oh, poor Joey. Poor Joey.

428
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:49,089
She spent so much time with her,
and... I don't know. What's the point?

429
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,599
We can't watch her constantly.

430
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,060
There's no way
you can be with her all the time.

431
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,729
How is Joey?

432
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:02,153
I worry about her.
She seems to be floundering.

433
00:33:02,273 --> 00:33:05,443
I don't know.
I guess she hasn't found herself yet.

434
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,738
Couldn't you help her?
She looks up to you.

435
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:13,163
I do, Dad. I try. I try to be supportive.
I try to encourage her.

436
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,004
I'm not criticising,

437
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,130
but it just seems to me there's always
been an antagonism between you two.

438
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,670
Well, you know Joey.
She tends to be competitive with me.

439
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:27,804
Well, you're very successful.
I think you kind of hold that over her.

440
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:32,224
- Come on, Dad, That's not true.
- No, Renata. I'm not blind.

441
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:36,595
I see what's going on.
You seclude yourself in Connecticut,

442
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:39,725
acting out the part of the aloof artist,
and no one can get near you.

443
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,653
I don't wanna discuss this
right now, Dad. OK?

444
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:45,481
Can we just avoid the subject.
I'm upset. You're upset.

445
00:33:47,318 --> 00:33:50,988
Joey had such potential.
And now it's come to nothing.

446
00:33:51,114 --> 00:33:53,244
It's so typical. It's so typical.

447
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:56,406
As usual, you're obsessed with Joey
while Mother is lying in a hospital room.

448
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:00,206
Now, don't blame me for that.
That's nobody's fault.

449
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:08,129
- How's Frederick?
- Oh, fine.

450
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,506
- He's going to be teaching at Barnard.
- Oh, how nice.

451
00:34:11,634 --> 00:34:15,474
I read something he wrote recently
in a "Sunday Times" review, I think.

452
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:18,387
It was very nasty, but very funny.

453
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:24,524
It's a giraffe. Enormous.
Cory would love it.

454
00:34:24,647 --> 00:34:27,897
It's probably way too much money
but I'd really like to buy her one.

455
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:30,196
She's so cute.

456
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,030
She sits and has conversations
with the television set.

457
00:34:34,157 --> 00:34:37,327
She's such a pretty thing.

458
00:34:38,661 --> 00:34:40,911
- How's Mike?
- Fine.

459
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,499
We'd love to get together
with you and Frederick.

460
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:48,045
Oh, well, that'd be great, but it's
been sort of a rough week for me.

461
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,131
It doesn't necessarily
have to be this week.

462
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:54,256
I gotta give Frederick a chance
to get settled in at Barnard.

463
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,770
Renny, why do you keep pushing me away?

464
00:34:59,891 --> 00:35:02,351
- Well, I don't.
- Yeah. Yeah, you do.

465
00:35:02,477 --> 00:35:05,227
- It's like you don't even want me near you.
- Oh, Joey, come on.

466
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:08,028
You know, I mean. You know that
I've been having some work problems.

467
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:10,188
I need isolation, I need to be alone.

468
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:12,528
The creative thing, it's very delicate.

469
00:35:12,654 --> 00:35:15,664
That's great. You hide behind your work.

470
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:17,492
Flyn's never here, and I inherited Mother.

471
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:19,787
I see Mother too. I phone her.

472
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:23,331
Yeah. But you're in Connecticut,
and I end up with all the dirty work.

473
00:35:23,456 --> 00:35:27,206
Look, Joey. I can't help it if you feel guilty
about your feelings toward Mother.

474
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:29,915
I mean, you can't seem to do enough
to make up for it.

475
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:32,876
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You know what it means.

476
00:35:33,007 --> 00:35:35,177
You could never stand her.

477
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:38,641
I don't believe this. My whole life,
I've only wanted to be her.

478
00:35:38,763 --> 00:35:41,773
Yeah. Well, for a while there,
you were her, weren't you?

479
00:35:41,891 --> 00:35:43,451
I don't know what you're talking about.

480
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,650
Oh, Joey, you know what I'm talking about.

481
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,400
All those headaches every time
she'd come home from the hospital.

482
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,023
You never wanted her to come home.

483
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,530
This is incredible. I mean,
you twist everything I say. I give up.

484
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:21,507
You OK?

485
00:38:23,261 --> 00:38:26,141
I just experienced
the strangest sensation.

486
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:30,062
Well, you look kind of pale.

487
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:33,725
It was as if I had a sudden...

488
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:38,403
clear vision where everything seems...

489
00:38:39,068 --> 00:38:41,898
sort of awful and predatory.

490
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:48,704
It was like... It was like I was here

491
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:53,418
and the world was out there,
and I couldn't bring us together.

492
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,464
Could you maybe have dozed off
and had one of those dreams?

493
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:59,047
No.

494
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:05,052
No, because the same thing happened
last week when I was reading upstairs.

495
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,601
I suddenly became hyper aware of my body.

496
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,767
And I could feel my heart beating,

497
00:39:14,896 --> 00:39:17,476
and I began to imagine that...

498
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:21,985
I could feel the blood sort of
coursing through my veins

499
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:26,871
and my hands
and in the back of my... neck.

500
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:32,036
I felt precarious, like I was
a machine that was functioning

501
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,963
but I could just conk out at any second.

502
00:39:36,626 --> 00:39:38,496
You're not gonna conk out.

503
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:41,128
You gotta put those kind of thoughts
out of your head.

504
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,375
Yeah. It frightens me too,
you know, because...

505
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:48,854
I'm not that far from the age when
Mother began showing signs of strain.

506
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:51,561
You're not your mother.
You're not. You're not.

507
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:54,602
You've been under some kind of stress
and you haven't been sleeping well.

508
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:56,847
Things like that. That's all.

509
00:40:06,322 --> 00:40:09,832
What are these?
Are these Joey's photographs, these?

510
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,501
- Oh, yeah.
- Let me see.

511
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:14,580
They're not very good, I'm afraid.

512
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:18,375
No. She doesn't really have an eye.

513
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:22,672
She's gonna wanna know what you think,
so you'd better get ready.

514
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,837
Poor Joey.

515
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:29,928
She has all the anguish and anxiety

516
00:40:30,054 --> 00:40:33,644
of the artistic personality
without any of the talent.

517
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:37,896
And naturally, I'm put in the position
of having to encourage her.

518
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:40,860
No, tell her the truth.
Get it over with. Don't lead her on.

519
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:43,992
I don't lead her on, but I mean,
God, I can't break her heart.

520
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,110
And you know how
competitive she is with me.

521
00:40:49,365 --> 00:40:52,615
I always think it's better
to level with a person.

522
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:55,463
- Wish you'd done that with me more often.
- I did.

523
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,750
No, you didn't.
You flattered me, and I liked it.

524
00:40:57,874 --> 00:41:00,884
Frederick, you're good,
and I've never hesitated to say it.

525
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:04,342
There's something missing from my work.

526
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:09,894
I don't know. I don't know if I've lost it
or I never had it, or what.

527
00:41:10,887 --> 00:41:14,137
You're capable of being extraordinary
and you've stopped for spite.

528
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:17,643
No, not for spite!

529
00:41:22,773 --> 00:41:25,113
I'll get back to it someday.

530
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:28,114
You throw everything away to spite me.

531
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:29,737
Let's not talk about it, OK?

532
00:41:31,157 --> 00:41:33,077
Fine.

533
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,133
What are you gonna say to Joey?

534
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:43,746
She should just marry Michael

535
00:41:43,878 --> 00:41:46,668
and stop her obsessive worrying
about being so damn creative.

536
00:41:46,797 --> 00:41:49,257
Sometimes she just annoys me.

537
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,289
'Oh, Jimmy's getting excited. Isn't he?

538
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,246
'It's an exciting thing to be a Christian,

539
00:42:24,377 --> 00:42:27,087
'and I have a gentleman
who's a friend of mine,

540
00:42:27,213 --> 00:42:31,683
'a fairly new friend, but our friendship
goes way back to the cross of Calvary.

541
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:35,051
'Roy Schwartz, it's a delight
to have you here today.

542
00:42:35,179 --> 00:42:39,229
'Now, Roy, you are
by birth what nationality?'

543
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:42,269
- 'A Hebrew.'
- 'A Hebrew.

544
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:45,105
'When I was talking about
God's chosen people...

545
00:42:45,231 --> 00:42:48,281
'you're probably very aware,
you've studied your history,

546
00:42:48,401 --> 00:42:50,401
'you're involved in this...

547
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:53,988
'what part did the Jewish people
and the nation of Israel

548
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,825
'have in God's timepiece today?'

549
00:43:01,914 --> 00:43:03,924
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

550
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,841
It's 45 minutes.

551
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,420
The traffic was unbearable, I'm sorry.

552
00:43:08,546 --> 00:43:12,676
- You should take that into account.
- Could we drop this? My head is splitting.

553
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,180
- What's the matter?
- What do you think? I'm pregnant.

554
00:43:16,304 --> 00:43:19,394
- Thought you might be.
- I'm goddamned annoyed!

555
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:21,812
- We'll take care of it.
- Naturally, we'll take care of it.

556
00:43:21,892 --> 00:43:24,649
- You don't think I'm gonna have a kid.
- I said we'll take care of it.

557
00:43:24,729 --> 00:43:26,109
It's nothing.

558
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm so stupid! How can I be so careless?

559
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:30,566
All right, it happens.

560
00:43:30,693 --> 00:43:33,324
You know, we could have the kid.
It wouldn't be the end of the world.

561
00:43:33,404 --> 00:43:35,368
For you maybe. For me,
it'd be the end of the world.

562
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:39,118
- I'm sorry you feel that way.
- Oh, Michael, I've thought about it.

563
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:43,373
It's absurd. How could we have a kid?
I don't even know where my life is going.

564
00:43:43,497 --> 00:43:46,787
- Maybe it's not such a great idea.
- You don't think so either?

565
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,957
I guess not.

566
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:56,260
- Well, what happened to you?
- Nothing. I'm sorry.

567
00:43:56,385 --> 00:43:58,385
We found something wonderful
for the bedroom.

568
00:43:58,512 --> 00:44:01,972
- This won't be too expensive, I hope.
- It's a little more than we planned.

569
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,099
- We had this discussion already.
- Can we not get into a financial dispute?

570
00:44:05,227 --> 00:44:07,767
It's right over here.
I think you'll like it.

571
00:44:11,776 --> 00:44:14,646
- Your father's back from Greece.
- Is he?

572
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:16,319
You know he's back from Greece.

573
00:44:16,447 --> 00:44:18,567
You're having dinner
with him tomorrow at Renata's.

574
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:20,619
Renata told me.
Were you not going to tell me?

575
00:44:20,743 --> 00:44:22,793
Yes, I just know how you are
on that whole subject.

576
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:25,162
Will you talk to him, Joey?
He listens to you.

577
00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:27,789
He's a grown man.
He makes his own decisions.

578
00:44:27,917 --> 00:44:30,417
Yeah, but he puts great store
by what you have to say.

579
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:34,594
If he wants to move back in with you,
he will. If he doesn't, he won't.

580
00:44:34,715 --> 00:44:39,385
- Why are you so reluctant to help me?
- Reluctant? I do nothing but cater to you.

581
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:42,101
Joey, it's as though you don't care
if we get back together or not.

582
00:44:42,181 --> 00:44:44,311
You're crazy.
Why wouldn't I want you to be happy?

583
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:46,233
I just think you shouldn't delude yourself.

584
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:48,062
Will you tell him
how well I've been doing?

585
00:44:48,187 --> 00:44:50,767
That my work is finally flourishing again?

586
00:44:50,898 --> 00:44:53,528
- That my mood swings are less rapid?
- He doesn't care.

587
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:56,071
He just wants to know
that I'm on an even keel, that's all.

588
00:44:56,195 --> 00:44:58,485
- I'm having an inner tranquillity.
- Leave me alone.

589
00:44:58,614 --> 00:45:00,374
- Joey...
- Just leave me out of this!

590
00:45:00,491 --> 00:45:02,331
Where are you going?

591
00:45:06,288 --> 00:45:08,544
Joey, maybe it wouldn't be
such a bad idea to have a child.

592
00:45:08,624 --> 00:45:11,134
- Oh, please.
- I mean, sometimes just taking...

593
00:45:11,252 --> 00:45:13,502
- I can't, OK?
- You mean you won't.

594
00:45:13,629 --> 00:45:16,049
Why do you stay with me?
I don't understand you.

595
00:45:16,173 --> 00:45:18,843
I give you nothing but grief.

596
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:24,971
I think, you should take the job
at the advertising agency,

597
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,309
and we should maybe
think about getting settled.

598
00:45:27,435 --> 00:45:29,305
Yeah, right! That's all I need.

599
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,984
If I start writing copy and having kids,
I'd never get out of it.

600
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:34,534
I'd be swallowed up
in some anonymous lifestyle.

601
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:37,150
I wanna do something with my life.

602
00:45:41,615 --> 00:45:43,775
Now I'm guilty 'cause I left
my mother standing.

603
00:45:43,909 --> 00:45:45,489
- She'll be fine.
- Oh, a lot you care.

604
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:48,789
It's your mother that can't stand me.

605
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:24,953
- Well...
- I hope the cat isn't in the kitchen.

606
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,290
Cory's gonna go upstairs
and play for a while. OK, Cory?

607
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:33,294
I'll see you later, all right?
All right. Bye.

608
00:46:34,168 --> 00:46:37,174
I mean, I'll be getting them all out
in about a month and a half.

609
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:40,404
Then you wouldn't have
anything left to say. Right?

610
00:46:41,527 --> 00:46:42,764
Dad.

611
00:46:42,885 --> 00:46:45,175
He was so excited when I spoke to him.

612
00:46:45,304 --> 00:46:48,104
He saw that terrible movie
that Flyn was in on the plane.

613
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:50,984
- Come in. Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

614
00:46:51,101 --> 00:46:54,191
The traffic in this town
is getting impossible.

615
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:56,113
Hi.

616
00:46:56,232 --> 00:46:57,612
Mike.

617
00:46:58,567 --> 00:47:00,567
- Hi, Joey.
- Hi, Daddy.

618
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:01,864
- Renata.
- Hello, Dad.

619
00:47:01,987 --> 00:47:05,527
- Hi. This is Pearl.
- Hello.

620
00:47:05,658 --> 00:47:08,288
- Hi.
- I'm Mike. This is Joey.

621
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,500
- Glad to meet you. Hi.
- Hello.

622
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,121
- Frederick.
- Hi.

623
00:47:12,248 --> 00:47:14,668
Um, would you like anything to drink?

624
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:18,093
Whatever Arthur's having's fine.

625
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,712
Here. Why don't you sit down there?

626
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:22,049
It's probably the only
comfortable place in the house.

627
00:47:25,553 --> 00:47:28,263
It's good to be back.

628
00:47:28,973 --> 00:47:31,313
Well, I'm sure
you must have enjoyed Athens.

629
00:47:31,433 --> 00:47:33,983
You can't beat Greece islands
for sand and blue water.

630
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:37,313
And the food!
I could eat lamb six times a day.

631
00:47:37,439 --> 00:47:38,769
And this one and his ouzo.

632
00:47:38,899 --> 00:47:41,859
The only problem I had
was nobody spoke English.

633
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:44,736
Oh, it didn't matter. Everybody
understood what was important.

634
00:47:44,864 --> 00:47:48,084
Did you get a chance to see
any of the temples, architecture?

635
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,160
Oh, yes. It's so wonderful.
You're steeped in history.

636
00:47:52,288 --> 00:47:55,118
We saw some great examples
from the fifth century BC.

637
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:58,249
Remember that little island
with the temple? Beautifully preserved.

638
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:02,507
- To tell you the truth, I prefer the beaches.
- She could sit in the sun all day.

639
00:48:02,631 --> 00:48:05,551
That's enough ruins.
How many ruins can you see?

640
00:48:05,676 --> 00:48:08,346
But that hot sand,
that blue water... that's for me.

641
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:09,760
I don't wanna rush anyone

642
00:48:09,889 --> 00:48:12,929
but maybe we should continue
this conversation in the other room.

643
00:48:14,018 --> 00:48:16,228
First time I went to Europe,
with my first husband,

644
00:48:16,353 --> 00:48:19,023
many years ago, all we saw was churches.

645
00:48:19,148 --> 00:48:20,608
One cathedral led to another.

646
00:48:20,733 --> 00:48:22,863
Don't misunderstand me,
they were beautiful but...

647
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:26,155
you see two or three,
then enough already. All the day...

648
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,160
- Did you know he was bringing someone?
- Yes. Didn't I mention it?

649
00:48:33,037 --> 00:48:35,327
Give me a good sirloin anytime.

650
00:48:36,582 --> 00:48:40,672
Charcoal. They talk about
club steaks and porterhouse?

651
00:48:40,794 --> 00:48:43,094
Sirloin, charcoal and blood rare.

652
00:48:44,006 --> 00:48:45,836
Pearl's husband was something of a chef.

653
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,100
He was an amateur chef.

654
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,430
Actually, he was in the jewellery business,
my first husband, may he rest in peace.

655
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:58,148
- Adam, my second, was an orthodontist.
- How many have you had?

656
00:48:58,938 --> 00:49:02,728
Two. Adam had a massive coronary.
Rudy was an alcoholic.

657
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:05,818
- Would you like some more gravy?
- No, no, no. It's too heavy.

658
00:49:05,945 --> 00:49:09,315
Ah, what are you worried about?
It's delicious. Try it.

659
00:49:09,907 --> 00:49:12,447
- Where are you from, Pearl?
- Florida.

660
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,746
Oh, we lived all over the place
when I was younger,

661
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,250
but I prefer a warm climate.

662
00:49:18,374 --> 00:49:21,004
I even lived in Australia for a year.

663
00:49:21,126 --> 00:49:23,746
With my sister Fay, when Adam died.

664
00:49:23,879 --> 00:49:26,219
I went nuts. It's dead there.

665
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:29,336
I was in Sydney, Australia, once.

666
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:33,258
Oh. Was I lying? Did you like it?

667
00:49:33,389 --> 00:49:36,519
It was just a vacation.
I was only there a couple of days.

668
00:49:36,642 --> 00:49:39,442
Lucky. It's like a morgue.

669
00:49:39,561 --> 00:49:42,311
Nothing to do at night, no pizzazz.
I couldn't take that.

670
00:49:42,939 --> 00:49:45,319
Here's a woman
who could go dancing every night.

671
00:49:46,485 --> 00:49:51,315
You know what I say: You only live once,
but once is enough if you play it right.

672
00:49:51,448 --> 00:49:55,368
- Do you have any children, Pearl?
- Oh, yes. I have two sons.

673
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:57,504
Lewis and John.

674
00:49:57,621 --> 00:50:00,711
Lewis is in real estate.
John runs an art gallery.

675
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:02,633
Oh?

676
00:50:02,751 --> 00:50:05,421
In the lobby in Caesars Palace
in Las Vegas.

677
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:09,796
It's not exactly a gallery,
it's more a concession.

678
00:50:10,384 --> 00:50:14,104
- Paintings of clowns on black velvet?
- That's right, junk.

679
00:50:14,221 --> 00:50:17,351
Oh, I tell you, it's pure junk,
but people like it.

680
00:50:17,474 --> 00:50:20,314
They get a kick out of it.
He does very nicely.

681
00:50:20,436 --> 00:50:25,396
- Pearl collects African art.
- Oh. Oh, I love black ebony.

682
00:50:25,524 --> 00:50:28,694
I own some statues.
Actually, they're from Trinidad.

683
00:50:28,819 --> 00:50:33,529
Oh, I love those real primitive statues
with the big hips and the big breasts.

684
00:50:33,657 --> 00:50:38,287
Oh, I even have some voodoo masks.
I believe in that stuff.

685
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:41,502
I could tell your fortune,
but I need cards. Later, maybe.

686
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:43,923
This couple we met were raving about it,

687
00:50:44,043 --> 00:50:46,553
so I cabled right away
from the office to get two tickets.

688
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:48,090
I'm glad I did. It was fabulous.

689
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:50,593
I know. We thought
it was very interesting too.

690
00:50:50,716 --> 00:50:54,716
But depressing as hell. I mean,
it was pessimistic to the point of futility.

691
00:50:54,845 --> 00:50:57,175
Fashionable pessimism
is all the rage nowadays.

692
00:50:57,306 --> 00:50:59,136
When they sentenced
those Algerians to death,

693
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:01,186
I thought it was a good ending.

694
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:04,270
I don't know. You call that fashionable,
but it's hard to argue

695
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:07,396
that in the face of death,
life loses real meaning.

696
00:51:07,524 --> 00:51:11,614
- It is?
- Well. I mean, I can't argue it succinctly,

697
00:51:11,737 --> 00:51:13,817
but I suppose if you've read
Socrates or Buddha,

698
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:18,157
Schopenhauer, even Ecclesiastes,
they're very convincing.

699
00:51:18,285 --> 00:51:21,785
Well, they should know.
I don't read that much.

700
00:51:21,914 --> 00:51:24,334
What struck me was the way the terrorists

701
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:26,168
only killed if they absolutely had to.

702
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:29,553
Never wantonly, just if they had to,
to achieve their own aims.

703
00:51:29,671 --> 00:51:34,341
I was very moved when that Algerian boy
said he killed in the name of freedom.

704
00:51:34,468 --> 00:51:38,058
- It gave me chills.
- It's still killing for an abstraction.

705
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:43,060
Why? You value the life of a single person
over the lives of thousands of others?

706
00:51:43,143 --> 00:51:45,483
I don't know.
I mean, who are those thousands?

707
00:51:45,604 --> 00:51:47,364
It's another abstraction.

708
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:51,071
To me, the conflict over
the giving of the information

709
00:51:51,193 --> 00:51:55,453
between the French doctor and
the Algerian was the best part of the play.

710
00:51:55,572 --> 00:52:00,082
I know. The writer argued both sides so
brilliantly you didn't know who was right.

711
00:52:00,202 --> 00:52:05,672
I didn't get that. I mean, to me,
it wasn't such a big deal.

712
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,711
One guy was a squealer.
The other guy wasn't.

713
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:09,165
I liked the guy that wasn't.

714
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:12,134
It's a little more complex than that,
don't you think?

715
00:52:12,256 --> 00:52:15,836
Why? You liked the squealer?
Did I miss something?

716
00:52:15,968 --> 00:52:18,638
That's what made me anxious
about the play, I mean,

717
00:52:18,762 --> 00:52:21,432
how do you figure out
the right thing to do?

718
00:52:21,557 --> 00:52:23,677
How do you know?

719
00:52:23,809 --> 00:52:28,979
How do you know? I don't know.
You just know, you feel it. I mean...

720
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:31,476
You just don't squeal. I don't know.

721
00:52:33,068 --> 00:52:35,528
Anyway, it was a good evening
in the theatre for a change.

722
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:38,698
I'd love another piece
of cheesecake but...

723
00:52:38,824 --> 00:52:42,664
Well, have it. What are you worried about?

724
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:46,916
You'll live to be 100 if you give up
all the things that make you want to.

725
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:57,046
Am I the only one or is it hot in here?

726
00:52:58,010 --> 00:53:00,100
Can we open a window?

727
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:02,470
OK. Ready?

728
00:53:02,598 --> 00:53:05,098
- Uh-huh.
- OK. Pick a card.

729
00:53:06,268 --> 00:53:08,268
- Anyone.
- There you go.

730
00:53:08,395 --> 00:53:09,733
- OK. Put it back.
- Let me see it.

731
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:13,483
Any place, any place.
All right. OK. Watch.

732
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:15,689
- I'm ready.
- All right.

733
00:53:16,486 --> 00:53:18,986
Now we shuffle.

734
00:53:19,114 --> 00:53:20,494
Now you... All right.

735
00:53:20,616 --> 00:53:23,326
- What?
- No, nothing. Just go ahead.

736
00:53:23,452 --> 00:53:25,202
- Is it that?
- No.

737
00:53:25,329 --> 00:53:26,329
- That?
- No.

738
00:53:26,455 --> 00:53:28,205
- That?
- Wrong.

739
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:30,832
- It's none of those three.
- None of those three.

740
00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:32,379
Not that one.

741
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:36,257
- Not that one.
- No.

742
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,431
- That one.
- Jesus, that's fantastic.

743
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,930
- How did you do that?
- Oh, what's the difference?

744
00:53:43,055 --> 00:53:45,215
That is a miraculous card trick.

745
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:48,809
And I was watching really closely.
Where did you learn that?

746
00:53:48,936 --> 00:53:52,726
I'm a gal that's been around.
I've picked up a lot of useless information.

747
00:53:52,856 --> 00:53:56,606
You tell fortunes. You do card tricks.
You do séances, too?

748
00:53:56,735 --> 00:54:01,105
Nuh-uh. Not me. I figure
whatever's out there, it's their business.

749
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:04,270
Besides, you think I wanna
bring back my ex-husband?

750
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,829
As soon as possible,
Pearl and I are gonna get married.

751
00:54:09,665 --> 00:54:11,495
Oh, God.

752
00:54:12,751 --> 00:54:14,541
That's gonna sink Mother.

753
00:54:14,670 --> 00:54:16,842
She'll have a hard time at first
but she'll get over it.

754
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:18,842
- Easy for you to say.
- It's not easy.

755
00:54:18,966 --> 00:54:22,046
- How long have you known her, Dad?
- Now, a month.

756
00:54:22,177 --> 00:54:25,307
A month? Isn't that a little hasty?

757
00:54:25,430 --> 00:54:28,890
- We've spent a lot of time together.
- That's a lot of time, four weeks?

758
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:31,227
I expect you all at the wedding.

759
00:54:31,353 --> 00:54:34,863
Flyn, too, I insist that Flyn fly in and meet
Pearl and be there when we're married.

760
00:54:34,982 --> 00:54:37,112
I must admit that the whole thing
does seem a bit fast.

761
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:38,572
It's gonna be fine.

762
00:54:38,694 --> 00:54:42,534
She's a nice woman.
She's kind. She's affectionate.

763
00:54:42,656 --> 00:54:45,826
Christ, I'm 63 years old. I wanna relax.

764
00:54:45,951 --> 00:54:48,251
I'm happy just to lie
on the beach with her.

765
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:51,870
I like it that she's full of energy
and demonstrative and open.

766
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:55,709
You just met her. She's a widow,
and you're a wealthy man.

767
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:57,916
What's that supposed to mean?
She's after my money?

768
00:54:58,046 --> 00:55:00,336
- She's not saying that.
- Why? Is that so far-fetched?

769
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:01,715
I won't dignify that.

770
00:55:01,842 --> 00:55:05,302
Don't get upset. It's just, a man
in your position has to be careful.

771
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:08,769
You don't know her yet.
She's a fine woman, and I love her.

772
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:12,940
OK. All right but it's going to be the worst
possible thing that could happen to Mother.

773
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:16,191
I can't believe she still imagines
we'll get back together after all this time.

774
00:55:16,315 --> 00:55:18,975
Of course, she imagines it because
everyone except me leads her on.

775
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:21,609
- I don't wanna hear that old story.
- It's true.

776
00:55:21,737 --> 00:55:24,987
And from the day you moved out,
all that talk about a trial separation.

777
00:55:25,115 --> 00:55:28,285
- You were never coming back.
- I wanted to let her down easily.

778
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:31,460
- She's such a fragile thing.
- She is not a thing.

779
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:34,830
I mean, we all treat her like a patient
in a hospital. She's a human being.

780
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,538
Your idea of treating her
like a human being

781
00:55:37,669 --> 00:55:39,909
is always to throw cold water
on her hopes all the times.

782
00:55:40,005 --> 00:55:41,625
What hopes? Now, look what's happening.

783
00:55:41,757 --> 00:55:43,547
It was bound to happen
sooner or later, Joey.

784
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,925
The most that we could do
was postpone it a little bit.

785
00:55:46,053 --> 00:55:49,063
- You're all she lives for.
- Don't give me that...

786
00:55:49,181 --> 00:55:53,811
- Now you're abandoning her for this...
- Joey, don't you go any further.

787
00:55:53,935 --> 00:55:56,225
All right, Dad. Don't get upset.
Don't get all riled up.

788
00:55:56,355 --> 00:55:58,694
And don't think I don't notice
the both of you looking at her

789
00:55:58,774 --> 00:56:00,574
in a very judgmental, superior way.

790
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:02,612
Now, you're imagining things.

791
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:05,196
We knew about your affairs
when Mother was in the hospital,

792
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:07,532
but your choices
were just a little more discreet!

793
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:10,697
Joey, shut up! Dad, she's upset.

794
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:12,067
Joey, why do you do this to me?

795
00:56:12,162 --> 00:56:13,872
You know how much
your opinion means to me.

796
00:56:13,997 --> 00:56:16,787
- She's a vulgarian.
- Joey, be quiet!

797
00:56:16,917 --> 00:56:18,627
I don't wanna discuss this.

798
00:56:18,752 --> 00:56:21,592
I think you should do as you feel,
with our blessing.

799
00:56:21,713 --> 00:56:26,553
- Joey, I count on you.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

800
00:56:26,676 --> 00:56:30,756
Will you tell him it's OK?
Obviously, it's your approval he needs.

801
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:33,139
He certainly had no trouble getting yours.

802
00:56:33,266 --> 00:56:34,771
Clearly, it doesn't mean as much as yours.

803
00:56:34,851 --> 00:56:38,021
I want the support of all my daughters!

804
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:41,066
I'm not just here to make
sacrifices and foot the bills.

805
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:44,651
It's time you thought of me!

806
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:09,088
I'm sorry to have hurried you
through lunch,

807
00:57:09,219 --> 00:57:11,259
but I wanted you to get here and see this

808
00:57:11,388 --> 00:57:14,718
before the place gets
cluttered up with people.

809
00:57:14,850 --> 00:57:17,890
When you wrote from Greece
you were telling me about

810
00:57:18,019 --> 00:57:21,519
the mosaics in the Orthodox churches.

811
00:57:21,648 --> 00:57:25,648
But look at this, all these mosaics.
There, behind the altar.

812
00:57:25,777 --> 00:57:29,527
And in a Romanesque church.
Isn't that amazing?

813
00:57:29,656 --> 00:57:33,906
And look at that. And here
in New York. It's really incredible.

814
00:57:34,035 --> 00:57:35,905
Quite surprising.

815
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:39,287
It makes me homesick for our trips.

816
00:57:39,416 --> 00:57:42,626
All those churches, you must have
seen a lot when you were there.

817
00:57:42,752 --> 00:57:43,962
Yes.

818
00:57:44,087 --> 00:57:51,217
Be so marvellous to forget everything
and take a nice slow trip to the Far East.

819
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:55,274
It might get us back on the right track.

820
00:57:55,390 --> 00:57:59,310
Eve, I said I had something
I wanted to say to you.

821
00:57:59,436 --> 00:58:01,226
What?

822
00:58:01,897 --> 00:58:04,977
I think we should finalise our divorce.

823
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,187
You do?

824
00:58:07,319 --> 00:58:10,409
Yeah. Sooner or later
we've got to face reality

825
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:13,580
and try to make new lives for ourselves.

826
00:58:15,035 --> 00:58:16,195
You know, it's very funny,

827
00:58:16,328 --> 00:58:19,368
because I thought that's
what might be on your mind.

828
00:58:19,498 --> 00:58:22,538
- It's not the end of the world.
- It's not?

829
00:58:22,667 --> 00:58:24,877
I think it's pretty goddamn terrible!

830
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:28,973
Eve, everything's going to be just fine.

831
00:58:29,090 --> 00:58:34,640
Oh, I know that it's a little... soon
perhaps to talk about a reconciliation,

832
00:58:34,763 --> 00:58:37,523
but I don't see why
we have to finalise our divorce.

833
00:58:37,641 --> 00:58:41,271
I don't see why we can't
just go on the way we are.

834
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:44,109
- We should be free to make other plans.
- Like what? What kind of plan?

835
00:58:44,189 --> 00:58:48,689
Well, in the event that we meet
other people. To become involved.

836
00:58:48,818 --> 00:58:50,948
What are you saying?
You wanna remarry? Is that it?

837
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:53,571
- I'm not discussing that.
- Have you met someone?

838
00:58:53,698 --> 00:58:55,158
- No.
- Oh, you're lying.

839
00:58:55,283 --> 00:58:58,163
Of course you've met someone.
Why don't you be honest about it?

840
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,116
Yes, I have.
But if you're gonna make much...

841
00:59:00,247 --> 00:59:05,127
Oh, never mind. Just don't talk about it.
Don't wanna hear any more.

842
00:59:05,252 --> 00:59:07,452
I talked with your doctor.
He feels you can handle this.

843
00:59:07,546 --> 00:59:12,586
- You talked to Dr Lobel behind my back?
- Not behind your back. Discreetly.

844
00:59:12,717 --> 00:59:17,257
You've discussed this with Dr Lobel
behind my back. It's so humiliating.

845
00:59:17,389 --> 00:59:20,979
Eve, it's your doctor and myself.
Now, how private can one be?

846
00:59:21,901 --> 00:59:24,101
And he assured you that I can handle it.

847
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:28,939
- Is that right? How humiliating!
- You're not humiliated.

848
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:31,697
Oh, I just wanna die.

849
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,910
Now stop that.

850
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,580
I just hate my life!

851
00:59:47,168 --> 00:59:50,008
Oh, I can't... I can't breathe!

852
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:16,741
Flyn!

853
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:18,365
Hi.

854
01:00:18,491 --> 01:00:22,041
Oh. Ahh. Oh, God, it's good to see you.

855
01:00:22,162 --> 01:00:25,922
- No, it's good to see you.
- You look terrific.

856
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:28,421
You really do. That's a great sweater.

857
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,173
- Oh, no.
- It really is. It's nice.

858
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:34,375
- You've seen this sweater before.
- No, I haven't. It's terrific.

859
01:00:34,507 --> 01:00:37,757
Are you tanned, Renny? You been somewhere?

860
01:00:37,886 --> 01:00:40,306
Why? Do I have on too much make-up?

861
01:00:40,430 --> 01:00:42,220
You're the one that looks great, Flyn.

862
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,889
Oh, no. I don't. I'm heavy.

863
01:00:44,017 --> 01:00:46,017
No. I've gained weight.

864
01:00:46,144 --> 01:00:49,774
My plane flight was so bumpy,
I thought I was gonna die.

865
01:00:49,898 --> 01:00:53,858
I made such a fool of myself
with the man next to me. Really did.

866
01:00:53,985 --> 01:00:58,655
- Have you met Pearl?
- Yes. She's not what I expected.

867
01:00:58,782 --> 01:01:03,042
No, God, God, isn't it strange
being back in the house again?

868
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,371
- Yeah.
- Have you spoken with Mother?

869
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:08,457
Oh, yes. We're gonna have
dinner one night this week.

870
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:12,547
- How's she holding up?
- I don't know. Better than we all expected.

871
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:16,761
- Isn't that right, Joey?
- She took it very badly at first.

872
01:01:16,883 --> 01:01:20,053
But after the initial shock,
she seemed to come out of it.

873
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:23,968
Joey feels that all of her Jesus Christ
nonsense is actually somewhat of a help.

874
01:01:24,099 --> 01:01:26,099
- Whatever works.
- Hello, Flyn.

875
01:01:26,226 --> 01:01:28,726
- Michael. Gosh, hi.
- Nice to see you.

876
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:30,773
It's good to see you, too.

877
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:33,187
Joey, you have to tell me
what you're up to.

878
01:01:33,316 --> 01:01:35,936
Yet another job. At an ad agency.

879
01:01:36,069 --> 01:01:39,029
- That's fabulous.
- No. But it's temporary.

880
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:42,775
Here we are. I made some
cocktail franks and meatballs.

881
01:01:42,909 --> 01:01:44,539
About time too. I'm starved.

882
01:01:44,661 --> 01:01:47,411
There's plenty. We have everything
your little heart desires.

883
01:01:47,539 --> 01:01:49,039
Good. Thanks.

884
01:01:49,165 --> 01:01:52,415
Are you and Dad gonna be staying on here
or are you gonna take a place in town?

885
01:01:52,544 --> 01:01:55,554
Well, it's a little quiet out here,
but Arthur loves it.

886
01:01:55,672 --> 01:01:57,762
Of course, it means redoing
so much of the house.

887
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:59,132
In what way?

888
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:04,470
Oh, I don't know. There's just
the two of us and it's kind of pale.

889
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:07,357
Besides, I have so much furniture I own
and pictures and knick-knacks.

890
01:02:07,475 --> 01:02:09,095
This place'd look like a warehouse.

891
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:11,767
Would you like to hear some music?

892
01:02:14,149 --> 01:02:16,359
Do I look older?

893
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,534
Older?

894
01:02:18,653 --> 01:02:21,243
Yeah, I mean it.
Do you think I look older?

895
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:24,280
No. Why would you think that?

896
01:02:24,409 --> 01:02:26,869
I don't know, I don't know. I...

897
01:02:27,912 --> 01:02:30,332
I look in the mirror every day
and I feel discouraged.

898
01:02:30,457 --> 01:02:32,997
Now I see you and you don't change at all.

899
01:02:33,126 --> 01:02:36,416
No, you don't change. Your skin,
it's like cream. Look at your skin.

900
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:38,716
I work at it.

901
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,180
No, I don't think that's it.

902
01:02:41,301 --> 01:02:47,101
I have a few good years, then my youth
will be frozen on celluloid for TV movies.

903
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:49,143
Come on, Flyn.
You're more than just beautiful.

904
01:02:49,267 --> 01:02:51,307
You know you have talent.

905
01:02:51,436 --> 01:02:54,106
- Don't pump me up, Renny.
- Why do you say that?

906
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,980
I know what I am.
Look, I'm not treated seriously.

907
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:02,660
When really classy projects
come along I get passed over.

908
01:03:02,781 --> 01:03:05,741
If it wasn't for the stupid
television industry...

909
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,327
You have always been
so self-deprecating, Flyn.

910
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:10,913
- You know that.
- No.

911
01:03:14,125 --> 01:03:18,875
No, you're the gifted one
in this family, Renny. I'm proud of you.

912
01:03:23,051 --> 01:03:27,351
I wish you lived here, I really do.
Every time I see you, I...

913
01:03:27,472 --> 01:03:30,392
It just reminds me how much I do miss you.

914
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:37,728
How's Frederick?

915
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:44,359
He's angry. He's teaching
when he really wants to be writing.

916
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,623
Teaching's something
that can't be taught anyway.

917
01:03:47,742 --> 01:03:50,502
Now, he's taking his rage
out in these critical pieces

918
01:03:50,620 --> 01:03:53,620
under the guise of high standards.

919
01:03:55,041 --> 01:03:57,501
I don't know. I guess I...

920
01:03:58,419 --> 01:04:03,549
- I don't think I've been very good for him.
- Oh, Renny, he idolises you.

921
01:04:06,511 --> 01:04:08,271
What time is it? We ought to get back.

922
01:04:08,388 --> 01:04:11,678
No, I think I'm gonna stay a while longer.

923
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:14,268
OK, I'll see you back there.

924
01:04:37,417 --> 01:04:38,957
Hi.

925
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:48,335
You know I want you to be happy.
I want you both to be happy.

926
01:04:51,806 --> 01:04:53,846
Tell her.

927
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:56,475
Tell Pearl.

928
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:04,650
I know she puts on a gay facade,
but... she knows how you feel.

929
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:08,663
Tell her.

930
01:05:09,282 --> 01:05:11,332
Will you?

931
01:05:12,368 --> 01:05:13,788
OK.

932
01:05:58,456 --> 01:06:00,456
You look deep in thought.

933
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:04,433
I'm deep in vodka.

934
01:06:05,964 --> 01:06:08,554
Would you help me get my boots off?

935
01:06:09,801 --> 01:06:12,391
That's the best offer I had all year.

936
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:18,225
I paid 200 bucks for these boots
and they kill my feet.

937
01:06:28,569 --> 01:06:31,109
I did a terrible thing last week.

938
01:06:32,365 --> 01:06:35,735
I wrote about this friend's book.
Not a very good book.

939
01:06:35,868 --> 01:06:39,828
I pointed that out.
Which is what I was getting paid to do.

940
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:45,340
But I was extremely cruel about it.

941
01:06:47,088 --> 01:06:49,588
And I took great pleasure in my cruelty.

942
01:06:52,135 --> 01:06:54,465
My anger scares me.

943
01:06:56,472 --> 01:06:58,982
I don't like what I'm becoming.

944
01:07:00,727 --> 01:07:04,107
I happen to think you're
a very impressive person.

945
01:07:04,772 --> 01:07:07,902
Oh, I think you have very impressive feet.

946
01:07:09,610 --> 01:07:12,610
And I happen to think you're very drunk.

947
01:07:12,739 --> 01:07:16,779
- Come on, not yet.
- Yes. Thank you.

948
01:07:55,782 --> 01:07:59,622
We are gathered together here
in the presence of this company

949
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:04,424
to join this man and this woman
in the bonds of matrimony.

950
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:08,420
Arthur, will you have this woman
as your wedded wife,

951
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:12,304
to live together in the ordinances
and estate of matrimony?

952
01:08:12,423 --> 01:08:15,133
Will you love her, comfort her,

953
01:08:15,259 --> 01:08:18,349
honour and keep her
in sickness and in health,

954
01:08:18,471 --> 01:08:23,681
and, forsaking all others, keep you only
unto her so long as you both do live?

955
01:08:24,477 --> 01:08:26,227
I will.

956
01:08:26,354 --> 01:08:30,574
Pearl, will you have this man
as your wedded husband,

957
01:08:30,691 --> 01:08:34,111
to live together in the ordinances
and estate of matrimony?

958
01:08:34,237 --> 01:08:36,607
Will you love him, comfort him,

959
01:08:36,739 --> 01:08:40,279
honour and keep him
in sickness and in health,

960
01:08:40,409 --> 01:08:46,169
and, forsaking all others, keep you only
unto him so long as you both do live?

961
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:48,460
I will.

962
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:52,384
In as much as Arthur and Pearl
have consented together in wedlock,

963
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:54,915
and have witnessed the same
before this company,

964
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:57,679
and thereto have pledged
each to the other,

965
01:08:57,802 --> 01:09:00,852
and have declared the same
by joining of hands,

966
01:09:00,972 --> 01:09:03,472
I, in accordance with
the authority invested in me

967
01:09:03,599 --> 01:09:05,559
by the law of the State of New York,

968
01:09:05,685 --> 01:09:09,395
do announce that they
are husband and wife.

969
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:13,819
You may kiss the bride.

970
01:09:15,820 --> 01:09:18,360
Well, Arthur, friends...

971
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:22,865
Congratulations.

972
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:37,590
Jesus, I don't think I've ever
seen him dance before in his life.

973
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,694
OK. Don't forget.

974
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:08,869
- Let me get you some champagne.
- That would be perfect.

975
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:11,543
Come on, baby.

976
01:10:13,669 --> 01:10:15,299
All right.

977
01:10:18,883 --> 01:10:20,723
Oh, my!

978
01:12:32,850 --> 01:12:35,060
Jesus Christ, be careful!

979
01:12:37,229 --> 01:12:40,649
- You've had too much to drink.
- Just because I don't act like an animal!

980
01:12:40,775 --> 01:12:44,945
- That's enough!
- Oh, please! Just leave me alone!

981
01:14:27,673 --> 01:14:29,183
What?

982
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:45,151
Oh, Frederick, you're drunk.

983
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:54,277
C'mon. You're always flirting with me.

984
01:14:55,493 --> 01:14:56,793
No.

985
01:14:56,911 --> 01:15:00,331
Yes. You flirt. You like to be looked at.

986
01:15:00,998 --> 01:15:05,788
Otherwise you don't exist,
except in somebody else's eyes.

987
01:15:07,838 --> 01:15:10,668
Stop it, Frederick. You're drunk.

988
01:15:10,799 --> 01:15:15,969
No, I'm celebrating. You got
a new mother. She's a hot number.

989
01:15:16,996 --> 01:15:19,476
Can't you feel the heat?

990
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:21,600
No.

991
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:25,185
C'mon. It's been such a long time

992
01:15:25,314 --> 01:15:28,984
since I made love to a woman
that I didn't feel inferior to.

993
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:31,649
Or am I being tactless?

994
01:17:21,180 --> 01:17:22,970
Mother?

995
01:17:25,017 --> 01:17:26,977
Is that you?

996
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:36,321
You shouldn't be here.

997
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:40,872
Not tonight.

998
01:17:46,789 --> 01:17:48,579
I'll take you home.

999
01:17:52,753 --> 01:17:55,263
You look so strange and tired.

1000
01:17:59,843 --> 01:18:02,303
I feel like we're in a dream together.

1001
01:18:07,309 --> 01:18:09,899
Please don't look so sad.

1002
01:18:15,984 --> 01:18:18,534
It makes me feel so guilty.

1003
01:18:21,281 --> 01:18:24,031
I'm so consumed with guilt.

1004
01:18:29,707 --> 01:18:31,537
It's ironic

1005
01:18:33,293 --> 01:18:36,963
because, uh... I've cared for you so...

1006
01:18:39,466 --> 01:18:44,216
And you have nothing but
disdain for me, and yet I feel guilty.

1007
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:57,900
I think you're... really too perfect
to live in this world.

1008
01:18:58,026 --> 01:19:03,316
I mean, all the...
beautifully furnished rooms,

1009
01:19:04,533 --> 01:19:09,123
carefully-designed interiors,
everything's so controlled.

1010
01:19:11,039 --> 01:19:15,379
There wasn't any room
for any real feelings.

1011
01:19:17,463 --> 01:19:19,053
None.

1012
01:19:20,382 --> 01:19:22,892
Between any of us.

1013
01:19:23,594 --> 01:19:25,474
Except Renata,

1014
01:19:30,851 --> 01:19:33,731
who never gave you the time of day.

1015
01:19:37,357 --> 01:19:39,397
You worship Renata.

1016
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:44,160
You worship talent.

1017
01:19:46,074 --> 01:19:49,584
Well, what happens to
those of us who can't create?

1018
01:19:51,121 --> 01:19:56,751
What do we do? What do I do, when
I'm overwhelmed with feelings about life?

1019
01:19:58,629 --> 01:20:01,169
How do I get them out?

1020
01:20:02,674 --> 01:20:05,514
I feel such rage toward you!

1021
01:20:09,264 --> 01:20:13,564
Oh, Mother. Don't you see?

1022
01:20:16,939 --> 01:20:21,149
You're... not just a sick woman.

1023
01:20:23,487 --> 01:20:26,027
That would be too easy.

1024
01:20:30,077 --> 01:20:32,157
The truth is...

1025
01:20:33,956 --> 01:20:37,626
there's been perverseness

1026
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:41,051
and wilfulness of attitude

1027
01:20:41,171 --> 01:20:44,051
in many of the things you've done.

1028
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:50,927
At the centre of a sick psyche
there is a sick spirit.

1029
01:20:58,605 --> 01:21:01,145
But I love you.

1030
01:21:04,444 --> 01:21:08,034
And we have no other choice
but to forgive each other.

1031
01:21:08,782 --> 01:21:11,332
- Are you talking to someone?
- Yes, uh...

1032
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:13,121
I thought I heard voices.

1033
01:21:13,787 --> 01:21:15,827
- Mother?
- Yes?

1034
01:21:15,956 --> 01:21:17,286
What?

1035
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:20,128
You said "mother" and I said "yes".

1036
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:23,009
Mother?

1037
01:21:50,949 --> 01:21:52,619
Mother!

1038
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,710
Mother!

1039
01:28:17,127 --> 01:28:21,797
'After the funeral service,
we all returned to the beach house.

1040
01:28:23,758 --> 01:28:27,888
'I couldn't help experiencing
some very nostalgic memories.

1041
01:28:29,472 --> 01:28:31,892
'Naturally, of my mother

1042
01:28:32,684 --> 01:28:36,904
'and, pleasantly, of the few
warmer moments we'd known.

1043
01:28:38,857 --> 01:28:40,857
'I recalled how beautiful she was,

1044
01:28:40,984 --> 01:28:44,074
'dressing to go out
for the evening with my father.

1045
01:28:46,614 --> 01:28:51,244
'And of how Renata looked up to her,
and her ideas about art.

1046
01:28:54,205 --> 01:28:57,825
'And how Flyn was
so impressed as a tiny girl

1047
01:28:57,959 --> 01:29:00,669
'when Mother decorated a Christmas tree.

1048
01:29:03,256 --> 01:29:07,216
'I felt compelled to write
these thoughts down.

1049
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:11,971
'They seemed very powerful to me.'

1050
01:29:32,369 --> 01:29:34,449
Water's so calm.

1051
01:29:36,748 --> 01:29:38,300
Yes.

1052
01:29:40,192 --> 01:29:42,052
It's very peaceful.
