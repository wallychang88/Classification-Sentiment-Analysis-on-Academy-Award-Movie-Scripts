1
00:00:36,363 --> 00:00:41,535
TALK TO HER

2
00:03:29,578 --> 00:03:32,873
The stage is full of wooden
chairs and tables.

3
00:03:33,916 --> 00:03:37,294
Two women come out with robes.

4
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:41,257
Their eyes are closed.
Like two sleepwalkers.

5
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:45,803
You get scared...They trip
on everything, poor them.

6
00:03:46,136 --> 00:03:49,640
But suddenly, a man appears.

7
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:54,562
With a very sad face, the
saddest I have ever seen.

8
00:03:55,062 --> 00:03:58,691
He pushes tables and chairs
out of their way.

9
00:04:00,568 --> 00:04:03,612
You can't imagine how touching
it was.

10
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:08,659
Someone was sitting next to me.
In his 40s, handsome.

11
00:04:09,743 --> 00:04:13,038
He cried with emotion,
lots of times.

12
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,209
I don't understand why...
It was very beautiful!

13
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:20,880
I have a surprise for you!

14
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:32,057
I have an autograph of
Rina Baus for you.

15
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:34,810
I had to buy the photo.

16
00:04:37,187 --> 00:04:39,523
It is in english and says:

17
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:42,902
I hope you surpass all
the obstacles...

18
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,696
... and start dancing.

19
00:05:10,387 --> 00:05:13,140
-She has her period.
-It's early.

20
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,252
Good evening.

21
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:31,802
Benigno, can you
stay tonight?

22
00:06:32,136 --> 00:06:35,389
My sister can't,
and I don't have anyone else.

23
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:38,475
Why did you come?
You should have called.

24
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:42,104
I am not taking advantage of you.
This week you did 3 nights.

25
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:46,191
Don't worry. A free afternoon
is enough for me.

26
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:50,029
I have to see the house
workers. It's a mess.

27
00:06:51,822 --> 00:06:54,325
And to frame a photo.

28
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:58,662
My condition is not improving.
The hospital will decide.

29
00:06:59,121 --> 00:07:02,124
Your husband left you
and the children.

30
00:07:02,374 --> 00:07:06,003
Just come the nights you can.
We will be ok.

31
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:10,674
Thanks a lot.

32
00:07:11,884 --> 00:07:15,262
-You cut off the intestinal food.
-She couldn't take it.

33
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:18,641
-We will try again tomorrow.
-Yes, go now.

34
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:21,852
And keep the spirits up!

35
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:33,572
Six bulls and a woman.
Wednesday at Briuega.

36
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,369
Lydia P Gonzales will
fight six bulls.

37
00:07:40,162 --> 00:07:42,831
Why such a drastic decision?

38
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:46,502
It's my job. 2 bulls, or 6.
Whatever they say.

39
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:50,130
People say a lot of bullfighters
won't fight with you...

40
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,049
...because you are a woman.

41
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:54,677
People can say what they want.

42
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:58,389
Too much chauvinism in bullfighting,
but there are exceptions.

43
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:03,561
Nino Valencia was happy to share
billing with you for several months.

44
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:09,483
Do you think he did it
to promote himself?

45
00:08:09,858 --> 00:08:12,069
And when he succeeded that,
he abandoned you?

46
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:15,281
I told you, I don't want
to talk about this!

47
00:08:15,614 --> 00:08:18,867
But by talking about
certain problems...

48
00:08:18,867 --> 00:08:21,370
...is the first step
towards their solution.

49
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:23,956
-Nino Valencia...
-Enough!

50
00:08:24,331 --> 00:08:28,294
My dear Lydia, let me
finish the question.

51
00:08:28,294 --> 00:08:31,505
I am not discussing this.
I told you earlier.

52
00:08:31,672 --> 00:08:35,885
You didn't say anything earlier!
It's bad what you are saying!

53
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,971
They will think
it's a fixed interview.

54
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:42,766
And I am on of the few who
dare say the truth...

55
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,936
...and you should dare accept

56
00:08:45,936 --> 00:08:49,148
...that Nino Valencia
took advantage of you.

57
00:08:49,523 --> 00:08:54,028
He shared with you not only
the fame, but sex as well.

58
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:57,448
And he left you when
time was right.

59
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:01,869
Juan Luis, Marco here...
How are you?

60
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:04,622
I want to ask you something.

61
00:09:05,289 --> 00:09:08,709
I would like to do an article
about Lydia Gonzales.

62
00:09:09,668 --> 00:09:11,837
Yes, I see it too...

63
00:09:14,506 --> 00:09:17,259
I would like to do something
deep.

64
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:22,306
For the Sunday issue?
Great...

65
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:20,155
-The woman has gone crazy!
-She dedicates it to you.

66
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:24,243
She would let the bull injure
her, just so that you see it.

67
00:10:24,785 --> 00:10:27,746
You shouldn't have come,
especially you.

68
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,673
Don't tell me anything.
I know what I am doing.

69
00:11:20,132 --> 00:11:24,053
Nino should concentrate.
He doesn't want any more worries.

70
00:11:24,428 --> 00:11:28,307
Nothing to worry about. He should
just come to pick up his stuff.

71
00:11:29,016 --> 00:11:32,478
-Or tell me where to send them.
-Send them at my place.

72
00:11:32,478 --> 00:11:36,440
He, himself, should say so.
This is nothing to do with you.

73
00:11:38,901 --> 00:11:41,278
You can leave whenever you want.

74
00:11:41,612 --> 00:11:44,365
-Good evening.
-Scotch on the rocks, please.

75
00:11:44,365 --> 00:11:47,618
-What glass do you prefer?
-A tall one.

76
00:11:52,206 --> 00:11:55,209
Can I talk to you for
a minute, please?

77
00:11:56,877 --> 00:12:00,047
Forget it. When something is
over, it's over.

78
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:05,219
-What are you saying?
-Can I talk to you?

79
00:12:08,013 --> 00:12:11,475
If you take me to Madrid,
we can talk on the way.

80
00:12:11,475 --> 00:12:13,602
It will be my pleasure.

81
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:29,535
-Who named you Lydia;
-My father.

82
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:32,872
It's as if he sealed your destiny.

83
00:12:32,997 --> 00:12:37,293
He always wanted to be a bullfighter,
but stayed a banderillero.

84
00:12:38,002 --> 00:12:41,672
He is the one that was there
for me, more than anyone else.

85
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:44,425
But he died last year.

86
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:47,678
I am sorry.

87
00:12:48,304 --> 00:12:51,682
'El Pais' wants me to do a profile
on you for their Sunday issue.

88
00:12:51,932 --> 00:12:55,269
Do you write on bullfighting?
I don't know your name.

89
00:12:55,477 --> 00:12:58,689
To be honest,
I know nothing of it.

90
00:12:59,899 --> 00:13:03,569
But I know a lot about
desperate women.

91
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:07,239
And who told you I am
desperate?

92
00:13:07,573 --> 00:13:10,993
-This is the impression I have.
-Bullfighting doesn't interest you.

93
00:13:10,993 --> 00:13:14,079
You are interested in my
relationship with Nino Valencia.

94
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:17,416
Tell EI Pais to leave me alone!

95
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:57,748
-Take me from here!
-What's going on?

96
00:13:57,831 --> 00:14:01,502
Take me from here! There is
a snake in the kitchen.

97
00:14:01,794 --> 00:14:04,838
-Give me the keys.
-The door is open.

98
00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:07,341
Calm down.
And stay there.

99
00:15:37,473 --> 00:15:39,475
My purse.

100
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:43,771
Take me to a hotel.

101
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,815
I am never coming back to
this house.

102
00:15:47,524 --> 00:15:51,153
-To which hotel?
-To Eurobuilding, lets say.

103
00:16:19,765 --> 00:16:22,977
Don't tell anyone about
the snake, please.

104
00:16:23,852 --> 00:16:26,480
Only my family knows.

105
00:16:26,605 --> 00:16:29,858
I always respect other
people's phobias.

106
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:34,321
After what you have done, how
can I say no to to the profile?

107
00:16:35,114 --> 00:16:39,034
Think about it again. I will
call tomorrow, tell me then.

108
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:42,121
Thanks for everything.

109
00:17:04,393 --> 00:17:08,147
Do you want me to stay? I can
sleep in the sofa.

110
00:17:08,355 --> 00:17:11,525
No, I need to get used to
being alone.

111
00:17:52,441 --> 00:17:54,318
Do you wash her?

112
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,487
What do you think?

113
00:17:57,154 --> 00:17:59,823
-How was the night?
-normal.

114
00:18:00,199 --> 00:18:03,744
-Give it to me. I will do it.
-I am going now.

115
00:18:03,953 --> 00:18:06,247
-Good bye.
-Bye, Matilde.

116
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,585
It's so hot!

117
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:15,589
-Lets cut her hair.
-short, it's more practical.

118
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:19,552
We will leave it as it was
when she came here...

119
00:18:19,843 --> 00:18:22,721
...so that she is not surprised
when she wakes up.

120
00:18:22,721 --> 00:18:25,724
After 4 years, it will be great.

121
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:28,310
I believe in miracles.
So should you.

122
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,272
-Why me?
-Because you need them.

123
00:18:31,522 --> 00:18:35,568
One might happen to you,
and you will not know.

124
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:38,320
So hot!

125
00:18:38,571 --> 00:18:40,656
I took something from the
drugstore...

126
00:18:40,656 --> 00:18:43,659
...to help stop the perspiration
stains on my uniform.

127
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:47,496
My armpits are ok,
but look at my face.

128
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:49,832
-What's it called?
-Perspirex.

129
00:18:58,257 --> 00:19:00,718
It's Marco...
Remember me?

130
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,929
-How are you?
-Naked.

131
00:19:09,184 --> 00:19:12,062
I need to buy some clothes.
That's all I've got.

132
00:19:12,521 --> 00:19:14,982
I can bring you some
from your place.

133
00:19:15,357 --> 00:19:18,444
I don't want anything from there.
Maybe another time.

134
00:19:18,777 --> 00:19:20,905
-Where are we going?
-To Sybilla.

135
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:23,616
-You think I am crazy.
-Why?

136
00:19:23,866 --> 00:19:27,328
-Because I don't want to go home.
-No, I understand.

137
00:19:27,786 --> 00:19:31,874
When I separated, I couldn't
sleep in the same bed...

138
00:19:32,249 --> 00:19:35,294
I was sleeping in the sofa,
in the living room.

139
00:19:35,502 --> 00:19:39,673
For a week. Until I finally
bought a new bed.

140
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:42,218
So, you are separated.

141
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,845
I am alone.

142
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:49,391
AFTER A FEW MONTHS

143
00:20:06,575 --> 00:20:09,245
Marco, we should
talk afterwards.

144
00:20:09,578 --> 00:20:13,040
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

145
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:15,960
Indeed.

146
00:20:43,529 --> 00:20:47,908
Did you read about the nuns
that got raped by the missionaries?

147
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,289
Priests, themselves!
It's horrible!

148
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,667
Yeah, they've gone bad too!
Where are we heading to?

149
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:59,169
First they raped the locals.

150
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:02,882
Then, due to AIDS, they started
raping nuns.

151
00:21:03,757 --> 00:21:06,427
And I admired them so much!

152
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,430
Not all of them are rapists,
for sure.

153
00:21:09,722 --> 00:21:12,474
No, some of them are
pedophiles.

154
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:16,478
-What's that? Everyone loves fucking.
-Antonio, you are an animal!

155
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:21,233
-How do the bulls look?
-Good, but fat.

156
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,820
-How much do you think?
-Over 500 kilos.

157
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:29,283
I am going to the bar. And don't
forget, we are eating home.

158
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:32,870
If the kids don't see their aunt,
there'll be hell to pay.

159
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,982
Don't cry, my love.

160
00:24:57,491 --> 00:25:00,369
-How is it?
-Very bad.

161
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:02,162
It tore her apart.

162
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:04,790
The father will be happy now!

163
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:08,961
'Not the little one!', we kept
telling him, my mother and I.

164
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:14,216
And yet, she became like him.

165
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:16,427
Don't be upset.

166
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:19,471
What time is it?

167
00:25:19,722 --> 00:25:21,807
It has been four hours.

168
00:25:23,142 --> 00:25:25,978
AFTER THREE WEEKS

169
00:25:27,313 --> 00:25:29,398
Are you going to Cordoba?

170
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:33,027
Yes...I would like to stay,
but I can't.

171
00:25:33,152 --> 00:25:36,572
We can't do anything extra.

172
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:39,074
The bar's been closed for 20 days.

173
00:25:39,074 --> 00:25:42,536
The kids are with the neighbour,
and I've neglected the other one.

174
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:46,207
If something happens, can
you be here in 2 hours?

175
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:50,628
-Rest assured for that.
-We have to have faith.

176
00:25:52,713 --> 00:25:55,341
I light some candles...

177
00:25:55,341 --> 00:25:58,260
...but I find it very
difficult to have faith.

178
00:25:58,928 --> 00:26:02,056
When can we put her medals
back on her?

179
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:04,934
Not yet.

180
00:26:04,934 --> 00:26:09,063
With all these...
wounds, the tracheotomy...

181
00:26:11,982 --> 00:26:14,151
She never took them off.

182
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:29,833
I will get a vase.

183
00:26:48,852 --> 00:26:51,981
I have to go to the US
for three months.

184
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:55,526
It is very important,
says my agent.

185
00:26:55,859 --> 00:26:59,738
And yet...the way things
stand here...

186
00:27:02,533 --> 00:27:04,952
...I don't want to go.

187
00:27:17,631 --> 00:27:20,676
Can you get out for
a moment, please?

188
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:32,813
No smoking here.

189
00:27:35,274 --> 00:27:37,484
Did she talk to you that day?

190
00:27:39,236 --> 00:27:42,573
-Or rather, I talked.
-And what did you say?

191
00:27:43,908 --> 00:27:45,951
Things that concern me.

192
00:27:46,744 --> 00:27:49,622
Did she tell you anything
about me?

193
00:27:49,622 --> 00:27:53,584
Honestly, Lydia hadn't talked
about you for a long time.

194
00:27:54,418 --> 00:27:58,756
-It's my fault for what happened.
-No, it's my fault.

195
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:58,996
Caetano made me
freak out.

196
00:32:02,249 --> 00:32:05,753
Marco, I've always wanted
to ask you something.

197
00:32:06,003 --> 00:32:09,673
Why did you cry that night,
after you killed the snake?

198
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:13,802
It brought me lots of memories.

199
00:32:15,512 --> 00:32:18,974
Years ago, I had to
kill another snake.

200
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,435
We were in Africa.

201
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:24,897
She had the same phobia as you.

202
00:32:24,897 --> 00:32:29,902
She was waiting outside the tent,
terrified, defenseless...

203
00:32:31,237 --> 00:32:33,489
...and totally naked...

204
00:32:35,115 --> 00:32:38,410
...because she had seen the snake,
while we were asleep.

205
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:41,914
Was it the same one who made
you sleep in the living room?

206
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:46,627
I hate that woman.

207
00:32:47,044 --> 00:32:50,589
-I haven't seen her for years.
-Even worse.

208
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:53,551
What can I do to make you
forget her?

209
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,136
Exactly what you are doing now.

210
00:33:25,708 --> 00:33:29,461
You were sound asleep. We didn't
want to wake you up.

211
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:34,925
-Is Dr Vega here?
-He is in his office.

212
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:18,385
Rosa, close the door.
There's a draft.

213
00:34:19,136 --> 00:34:22,264
-She opened her eyes.
-That gives me the creeps!

214
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:25,559
-And when she yawns?
-I shit myself!

215
00:34:27,394 --> 00:34:30,522
Good morning, doctor.
I want to talk to you.

216
00:34:31,106 --> 00:34:33,359
How are you? Did you sleep well?

217
00:34:34,276 --> 00:34:35,903
I will buy you coffee.

218
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:40,783
How long for might Lydia
stay like that?

219
00:34:41,033 --> 00:34:44,703
Months... years...
maybe for the rest of her life...

220
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:47,998
There is no hope?

221
00:34:49,416 --> 00:34:52,836
As a doctor, I have to say
no... However...

222
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:55,130
RESUSCITATION

223
00:34:55,506 --> 00:34:58,842
Meryl Moon wakes up after
15 years in a coma.

224
00:34:59,176 --> 00:35:02,304
She went into a coma during
childbirth.

225
00:35:02,304 --> 00:35:06,600
Meryl was a PVS, persistent
vegetative state, like Lydia, for life.

226
00:35:07,393 --> 00:35:10,563
Her recovery contradicts
everything I am about to say.

227
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:12,523
That is, that there is hope.

228
00:35:12,898 --> 00:35:15,276
I insist. Scientifically, no.

229
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:18,445
But if you want to have faith,
OK.

230
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:22,032
Is she opening her eyes?
Or I imagine this?

231
00:35:22,032 --> 00:35:26,495
She does, but that doesn't mean
she is aware of anything.

232
00:35:26,954 --> 00:35:30,875
Her brain cell has been
completely destroyed.

233
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:36,005
However, it can control
the automatic functions...

234
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:40,759
such as breathing, sleeping,
waking up and intestinal functions.

235
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:43,554
She opens her eyes,
but mechanically.

236
00:35:43,554 --> 00:35:46,849
Her brain is dead. She has
no ideas and feelings.

237
00:36:01,155 --> 00:36:03,574
Come in, please.

238
00:36:14,835 --> 00:36:17,838
-My name is Benigno.
-Marco Zuloaga

239
00:36:18,005 --> 00:36:20,090
This is Alicia.

240
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:27,264
Was it your first night here?

241
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:30,226
The first one is the worst.
Then you get used to it.

242
00:36:30,226 --> 00:36:32,269
Why these boots?

243
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:35,648
They prevent her feet from
twisting or falling.

244
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:40,194
-They look like 'Ibiza' boots.
-I've never been to Ibiza.

245
00:36:40,569 --> 00:36:43,864
-I know you.
-From my books?

246
00:36:45,366 --> 00:36:49,411
It was in Cafe Muller...
We happened to be sitting together.

247
00:36:51,747 --> 00:36:55,709
And at some stage,
you started crying.

248
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:02,216
I told you about him.
He cried watching "Café Muller".

249
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,803
I have to go.

250
00:37:07,054 --> 00:37:10,182
That fast?
We barely talked.

251
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:13,394
-Maybe another time.
-Will you come in the afternoon?

252
00:37:13,769 --> 00:37:17,273
Come to see us. I am always here,
even during the night.

253
00:37:17,648 --> 00:37:20,651
I am a 'veteran' here.
If you need something...

254
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:47,803
-Should I call Dr Vega;
-Carry on with what you are doing.

255
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:05,154
The other day, while browsing
my notes...

256
00:38:06,113 --> 00:38:10,868
...I found some
from your visit.

257
00:38:11,368 --> 00:38:15,664
I wrote a topic to be discussed
during the second visit...

258
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:18,292
...that never took place.

259
00:38:18,584 --> 00:38:22,046
-What about?
-Your sexual orientation.

260
00:38:23,923 --> 00:38:28,260
-My sexual orientation?
-yes, your sexuality.

261
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:32,514
Whether you like men or women.

262
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:38,562
During your visit, you said
you were still a virgin.

263
00:38:38,938 --> 00:38:42,733
Answering your question
somehow...

264
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:48,239
... I think I look for men,
mostly.

265
00:38:49,615 --> 00:38:53,661
-Is this why you came to see me?
-I can't remember now.

266
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:58,916
I guess that's it...
But I am very well now.

267
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,043
Do you have a partner?

268
00:39:01,293 --> 00:39:06,590
More or less. I am not alone
anymore. I don't have a problem.

269
00:39:07,258 --> 00:39:10,135
I hope you were not offended
by my question.

270
00:39:15,766 --> 00:39:17,851
Was her father here?

271
00:39:18,936 --> 00:39:21,272
He asked me if I am a fag.

272
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:24,942
He used an american expression,
more subtle.

273
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:28,070
-What is my orientation?
-And what did you say?

274
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,656
-That I like men.
-Really?

275
00:39:31,198 --> 00:39:33,701
No, you fool. I lied.

276
00:39:33,993 --> 00:39:37,288
How can he dare ask whether
I like men or women?

277
00:39:37,538 --> 00:39:40,541
-What does he care?
-I am glad I found out.

278
00:39:40,875 --> 00:39:45,629
Did he ask the head nurse or you
if you like bestiality or coprophagy?

279
00:39:45,963 --> 00:39:49,592
No, you are right. They don't
ask such things.

280
00:39:56,974 --> 00:40:01,520
I might go on a trip, and I won't
be able to come and see you.

281
00:40:02,313 --> 00:40:06,066
But, in Geneva, they've
offered me a creation...

282
00:40:06,066 --> 00:40:09,153
...a choreography
that thrills me.

283
00:40:09,153 --> 00:40:12,823
An old idea for a ballet.
I call it 'Trenches'.

284
00:40:12,948 --> 00:40:15,993
It is about the first
world war.

285
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:18,871
I will need a lot of dancers...

286
00:40:18,954 --> 00:40:22,875
...because in the war there
are a lot of soldiers.

287
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:27,713
But everyone dances in Geneva.
It is great.

288
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:32,635
I want female dancers too, because
the soldier when dying...

289
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:36,472
...lets his soul
get out of his body...

290
00:40:36,764 --> 00:40:40,434
...the ghost of which
will be a female dancer.

291
00:40:41,101 --> 00:40:44,480
With a white classic skirt
like 'Giselle'...

292
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,234
...but with red stains of blood.

293
00:40:48,234 --> 00:40:49,652
Very good!

294
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,695
Alicia loved it.

295
00:40:51,695 --> 00:40:55,741
It's good because life emerges
out of death.

296
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:59,662
the female emerges from
the male.

297
00:41:00,162 --> 00:41:02,957
And from the earthly emerges the...

298
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:08,754
The beach?

299
00:41:10,422 --> 00:41:13,217
And from the earthly emerges the...

300
00:41:13,717 --> 00:41:15,719
The water?

301
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:18,430
The ethereal.

302
00:41:19,056 --> 00:41:22,601
The ethereal...
the imperceptible, the ghost.

303
00:41:23,477 --> 00:41:27,523
I have the music. It is from
Kristof Penderesky.

304
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:31,777
It was written for the victims
of Hiroshima, but it's OK.

305
00:41:32,027 --> 00:41:34,989
Of course. Alicia remembers
it perfectly well.

306
00:41:35,322 --> 00:41:39,493
It's music for the battle.
It's wild and beastly.

307
00:41:39,785 --> 00:41:43,497
And regarding the music during deaths
I have a masterpiece...

308
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:46,959
...which you will listen to,
right now.

309
00:41:49,253 --> 00:41:51,755
It will drive you crazy.

310
00:41:58,053 --> 00:42:00,431
Alicia, my dear.

311
00:42:00,848 --> 00:42:03,309
Good bye, my dear.

312
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,321
Good bye, Katerina.
And you look beautiful.

313
00:42:15,446 --> 00:42:18,699
-You should go ahead with 'Trenches'.
-I will.

314
00:42:32,713 --> 00:42:36,050
Look...We will place you
next to the window.

315
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:40,721
You will be able to see your
friends dancing.

316
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:48,229
I love this room.

317
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:51,482
I will order everything.

318
00:42:57,279 --> 00:43:00,241
Come in and shut the door...

319
00:43:05,996 --> 00:43:08,666
How are you?...Shit down.

320
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:11,669
Alicia, look who's here.

321
00:43:11,669 --> 00:43:14,505
We're just getting some air,
reading magazines...

322
00:43:16,382 --> 00:43:19,468
Who was the lady that just left?

323
00:43:19,468 --> 00:43:22,179
Katerina, Alicia's teacher.

324
00:43:23,222 --> 00:43:25,683
Dancing teacher.

325
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:28,185
Nice character, Katerina.

326
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:31,689
She has a dancing school somewhere
here. Alicia was her student.

327
00:43:31,939 --> 00:43:35,025
And Katerina loves her like
her daughter.

328
00:43:42,908 --> 00:43:45,786
FOUR YEARS AGO

329
00:44:17,526 --> 00:44:20,738
Benigno, You are by the window
for half an hour.

330
00:44:20,905 --> 00:44:22,865
I am coming, mum.

331
00:45:09,912 --> 00:45:12,039
What's the matter? Are you
following me?

332
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:20,172
This is yours, I think.
It must have dropped you.

333
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:25,928
is everything there?...
I didn't touch anything...

334
00:45:27,721 --> 00:45:30,432
-Where are you going?
-Home.

335
00:45:30,432 --> 00:45:33,811
Can I accompany you?
I have nothing else to do.

336
00:45:33,811 --> 00:45:37,898
-Yes, but I am going home.
-Of course...It will do me good.

337
00:45:38,148 --> 00:45:41,902
Dancing is my life.
I love dancing shows.

338
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:44,446
-Do you like dancing?
-Yes, of course

339
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:46,782
But I don't follow it.

340
00:45:46,782 --> 00:45:49,410
What else do you do,
besides dancing?

341
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,205
I travel and watch old movies.

342
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:57,376
Silent Cinema is attractive
to me, in particular.

343
00:45:59,128 --> 00:46:02,006
-Where do you go when you go out?
-I don't.

344
00:46:02,089 --> 00:46:04,174
You should go out.

345
00:46:04,174 --> 00:46:07,469
I was taking care of my mother,
but she passed away 2 months ago.

346
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,265
I am sorry. Mine died too,
years ago though.

347
00:46:12,641 --> 00:46:16,228
Here we are...
Thanks for the wallet.

348
00:46:43,464 --> 00:46:46,759
Dr Roncero, psychiatrist.
7th left.

349
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,847
Twenty three.

350
00:46:53,724 --> 00:46:57,353
I was waiting for her by the window,
but that day she didn't come.

351
00:46:58,103 --> 00:47:02,066
But I knew her address and that
her father was a psychiatrist.

352
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:12,201
Dr Roncero's office.

353
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,871
I would like to make an
appointment.

354
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:19,833
-Is it tomorrow at 5 OK?
-Isn't earlier possible?

355
00:47:20,125 --> 00:47:22,336
No, tomorrow at 5.

356
00:47:22,628 --> 00:47:24,505
Your name?

357
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:44,775
-What do you want?
-I have an appointment at 5.

358
00:47:53,534 --> 00:47:56,036
Come in. Don't stand there.

359
00:48:02,293 --> 00:48:05,921
Benigno Martin?...
I need some proof.

360
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:11,969
I just wanted to see Alicia,
but I was there, in a psychiatrist.

361
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:15,222
I decided to tell him I missed
my mother.

362
00:48:17,683 --> 00:48:20,811
I started when I was little.

363
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:25,482
And all those 15 years
you took care of your mother?

364
00:48:26,442 --> 00:48:30,863
I was always next to her...
I was studying to be a nurse.

365
00:48:31,238 --> 00:48:34,533
I was only going out to the
classes.

366
00:48:34,617 --> 00:48:38,787
I was also studying aesthetics,
make-up and hairdressing.

367
00:48:38,787 --> 00:48:41,248
But those by post.

368
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:45,127
So you did those on your mother?

369
00:48:45,502 --> 00:48:49,006
Of course, and I cut her hair,
dyed it, did her nails.

370
00:48:49,006 --> 00:48:52,092
And I scrubbed her down well,
front and back.

371
00:48:52,468 --> 00:48:55,554
My mother wasn't disabled, or mad.

372
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:58,182
She was only a bit lazy.

373
00:48:59,141 --> 00:49:02,937
She was a beautiful woman
and I didn't want to let herself go.

374
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:06,982
-What did your father say?
-Nothing. What could he?

375
00:49:07,233 --> 00:49:10,110
-Is he dead?
-God, no.

376
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:15,157
He is in Sweden, I guess.
I haven't heard of him for years.

377
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:17,952
Doesn't he come to see you?

378
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:23,290
He has his own family there,
after he left my mother.

379
00:49:25,793 --> 00:49:28,420
We are not in touch.

380
00:49:28,712 --> 00:49:31,757
Why did you come to see me,
Benigno?

381
00:49:32,967 --> 00:49:36,011
-What's your problem?
-Me? Nothing.

382
00:49:36,011 --> 00:49:40,182
You must have since you came
to see a psychiatrist.

383
00:49:42,726 --> 00:49:45,312
Loneliness, I guess.

384
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:51,151
Did you have a sexual
relationship with a woman?

385
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:55,823
-With a man?
-No, neither.

386
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:00,911
I will see you in a week.

387
00:50:01,203 --> 00:50:04,248
-Am I not well doctor?
-That's not it...

388
00:50:04,248 --> 00:50:08,294
However, your adolescence was
kind of special.

389
00:50:08,294 --> 00:50:11,881
-It wasn't special.
-It was. Very special.

390
00:50:13,215 --> 00:50:16,093
And we must analyze it in depth.

391
00:50:16,093 --> 00:50:18,220
Yes, lets analyze it.

392
00:50:22,933 --> 00:50:26,061
-Should I come in a week?
-Very well.

393
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:28,856
I am glad.

394
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:01,282
-What are you doing here?
-I was just going. Don't be angry.

395
00:52:01,782 --> 00:52:05,828
I just wanted to see you...
But I am harmless.

396
00:52:22,177 --> 00:52:25,806
Dr Roncero's office...
Hi, Lola...

397
00:52:26,181 --> 00:52:30,019
I just had a shit of
huge dimensions.

398
00:53:16,232 --> 00:53:18,859
Can you be in charge?

399
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:38,462
Alicia never came back. I
didn't want to scare her again.

400
00:53:38,796 --> 00:53:42,424
After a week I went to her
place, to see her father.

401
00:53:43,342 --> 00:53:46,011
It was raining during that
whole week.

402
00:53:52,268 --> 00:53:55,229
Next time I saw her was here.

403
00:53:55,229 --> 00:53:56,939
What happened to her?

404
00:53:57,022 --> 00:54:00,067
A car accident,
during a rainy day.

405
00:54:01,402 --> 00:54:05,406
Her father didn't want her to
be alone, not even for a moment.

406
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:07,992
He asked for the best nurses.

407
00:54:08,158 --> 00:54:12,788
And I have a good reputation here...
So they suggested me...

408
00:54:13,163 --> 00:54:18,085
And when he saw me, he remembered
me, and hesitated for a moment.

409
00:54:18,502 --> 00:54:22,047
But in the end, he took
Matilde and me, exclusively.

410
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:26,093
And this was four years ago...
And here we are now...

411
00:54:26,343 --> 00:54:28,012
Right, Alicia?

412
00:54:32,391 --> 00:54:35,728
I started going to the ballet,
when I had a day-off.

413
00:54:35,728 --> 00:54:39,315
And to the film library to watch
silent movies.

414
00:54:39,481 --> 00:54:42,818
German, american, italian
films, everything.

415
00:54:43,110 --> 00:54:46,113
And afterwards I would tell her
about all that she had seen.

416
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:50,743
The four most complete years
of my life.

417
00:54:50,743 --> 00:54:52,953
I take care of Alicia...

418
00:54:52,953 --> 00:54:56,707
I do what she would, except
the trips, of course.

419
00:54:56,916 --> 00:54:59,919
With me and Lydia
it's the opposite.

420
00:55:01,921 --> 00:55:04,256
I can't touch her.

421
00:55:06,592 --> 00:55:09,470
I don't recognize her body.

422
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:13,515
Neither can I help the nurses
turn her around.

423
00:55:14,225 --> 00:55:17,269
And I feel I am lousy.

424
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:20,231
Talk to her. Tell her that.

425
00:55:20,231 --> 00:55:22,525
I would like to,
but she can't hear me.

426
00:55:22,775 --> 00:55:25,361
How are you so certain
about this?

427
00:55:25,444 --> 00:55:28,572
Her brain is dead, Benigno.

428
00:55:28,948 --> 00:55:32,785
The woman's mind is a mystery,
especially in such sickness.

429
00:55:33,202 --> 00:55:36,997
You must look after the woman,
talk to her...

430
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:41,001
...don't forget that she's alive
and that you love her.

431
00:55:41,001 --> 00:55:45,130
This is the only therapy.
I know from experience.

432
00:55:46,674 --> 00:55:49,593
And what do you know
about women?

433
00:55:50,094 --> 00:55:53,931
Benigno, what do you know
about women?

434
00:55:58,227 --> 00:56:01,313
What do you know about women?

435
00:56:01,313 --> 00:56:05,860
A lot. 20 years next to one,
4 with another.

436
00:56:07,778 --> 00:56:11,782
I like the bullfighter's boyfriend.
He has style.

437
00:56:11,782 --> 00:56:14,743
How do you know? You saw him?

438
00:56:14,743 --> 00:56:18,831
Of course not, but I can tell
from his face.

439
00:56:19,248 --> 00:56:22,167
And his bulging trousers.

440
00:56:25,004 --> 00:56:27,631
He is a good friend of
Benigno, right;

441
00:56:29,425 --> 00:56:34,013
-Is he gay too?
-No way. What are you saying now?

442
00:56:34,305 --> 00:56:38,225
-Is Benigno, you think?
-Rumours say so!

443
00:56:38,475 --> 00:56:41,687
-You are wrong.
-Dr Vega told me so as well.

444
00:56:41,687 --> 00:56:45,482
-And where did he find out?
-From Alicia's father.

445
00:56:45,482 --> 00:56:48,777
I don't like the intimacy
he has with the patient...

446
00:56:48,777 --> 00:56:52,406
...but Vega told me not to
worry, because he is gay.

447
00:56:53,115 --> 00:56:56,827
I am going and I'll let you
carry on talking crap about him.

448
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:04,501
-She likes Benigno.
-She is not with her senses.

449
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:13,469
I have the day off.
I am going to the film library.

450
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:16,555
-Are you coming?
-I will see my publisher tonight.

451
00:57:16,555 --> 00:57:19,433
I have to go back to work soon.

452
00:57:20,226 --> 00:57:22,978
This woman is not well.

453
00:57:24,146 --> 00:57:28,526
You know what I mean.
Her skin is dry.

454
00:57:29,193 --> 00:57:31,946
lets see... Here...

455
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:39,036
-Did you talk to her?
-No, and don't insist.

456
00:57:44,166 --> 00:57:47,962
Hi, Lydia. You must be
patient with him.

457
00:57:51,423 --> 00:57:53,384
Have a good time at work.

458
00:58:07,273 --> 00:58:09,733
'Shrinked lover'.

459
00:58:21,829 --> 00:58:25,791
Rosa has the flu.
I hope you didn't get it from her.

460
00:58:28,711 --> 00:58:32,423
I am glad you feel well,
but I will massage you...

461
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:35,467
...and I will rub you with
a rosemary lotion.

462
00:58:58,365 --> 00:59:01,368
No, nothing is happening to me.

463
00:59:03,078 --> 00:59:07,833
Last night I saw a movie that
shook me a lot.

464
00:59:10,294 --> 00:59:13,297
It was the love story...

465
00:59:13,297 --> 00:59:17,635
...of Alfredo, a nice young
guy, but a bit fat...

466
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:22,139
...and Amparo, his fiance
who is a scientist.

467
00:59:22,848 --> 00:59:25,935
Amparo prepares a new
experimental diet...

468
00:59:26,268 --> 00:59:29,230
...that will revolutionize
the food industry.

469
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:33,108
What egoism! You only
think of yourself!

470
00:59:59,385 --> 01:00:00,970
I found it!

471
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:12,439
It might be dangerous. I never
gave it to a human before.

472
01:00:20,573 --> 01:00:22,992
You still think I act
with selfishness?

473
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,442
It has done miracles for you!

474
01:01:07,828 --> 01:01:11,373
Don't worry, my love!
I will find the antidote!

475
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:21,258
Time was passing by...

476
01:01:21,258 --> 01:01:24,220
...but Amparo couldn't find
the antidote...

477
01:01:24,553 --> 01:01:27,932
...and poor Alfredo,
day by day, shrank in misery.

478
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,980
I will always love you.

479
01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:38,734
So that Amparo doesn't suffer...

480
01:01:38,734 --> 01:01:42,446
...Alfredo leaves and goes
to find his mother.

481
01:01:42,571 --> 01:01:45,741
He hadn't seen her for 10 years,
because he was lousy.

482
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:49,828
He hadn't told Amparo
where his mother lived.

483
01:01:50,079 --> 01:01:53,499
Lots of things going on
in this movie.

484
01:01:53,916 --> 01:01:56,669
But the most important
thing is...

485
01:01:57,336 --> 01:02:01,590
...after years full of
regrets and studies...

486
01:02:02,758 --> 01:02:07,012
...Amparo finds the address
of his mother.

487
01:02:09,098 --> 01:02:11,642
And goes there.

488
01:02:55,978 --> 01:02:59,106
Hotel Youkali.
Room 15.

489
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:29,094
-Sleep, my darling.
-And what if I be a burden by mistake?

490
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:56,867
And Alfredo...

491
01:05:59,286 --> 01:06:02,122
...stays inside her...

492
01:06:04,833 --> 01:06:07,169
...for ever.

493
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:31,569
AFTER ONE MONTH

494
01:06:32,611 --> 01:06:36,615
Come on, put your hands
correctly ... This way...

495
01:06:42,162 --> 01:06:45,291
It's quite cool...
It's great...

496
01:06:45,708 --> 01:06:48,669
It's nice here by
the balcony, right?

497
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:52,006
Lydia likes to sit by
the balcony as well.

498
01:06:52,756 --> 01:06:55,301
Did you hear that? She likes
it a lot.

499
01:06:55,968 --> 01:07:00,097
Look at them... It's as if
they are talking about us.

500
01:07:02,183 --> 01:07:04,476
What do you think they say?

501
01:07:05,227 --> 01:07:07,771
They have no shame.

502
01:07:07,771 --> 01:07:11,150
Women talk about everything
with each other.

503
01:07:12,401 --> 01:07:16,363
Lydia would tell her she has
completed two months sick.

504
01:07:51,815 --> 01:07:54,151
Benjamin and Angela...

505
01:07:54,151 --> 01:07:58,239
...will you bond in marriage,
with your own will?

506
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:04,995
Join your hands together...

507
01:08:05,371 --> 01:08:09,500
...and declare your wish
in front of God.

508
01:08:13,712 --> 01:08:16,715
I, Angela,
take you, Benjamin...

509
01:08:17,216 --> 01:08:20,344
...to be my lawful husband...

510
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:24,348
I will love you
in happiness and in sickness...

511
01:08:24,849 --> 01:08:28,936
...so long as we shall both live.

512
01:08:30,187 --> 01:08:33,357
The Lord that joined you in love...

513
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:37,862
...let him accept your declaration
of love today.

514
01:08:38,237 --> 01:08:41,907
May your love last eternally.

515
01:08:42,491 --> 01:08:45,744
What are you doing here? We
were gonna meet at the hotel.

516
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:49,832
I changed my mind.
I've always liked weddings.

517
01:08:50,124 --> 01:08:53,419
Weren't you gonna see
your sister before the game?

518
01:08:53,669 --> 01:08:56,630
I called her.
She will come to the hotel.

519
01:08:56,630 --> 01:08:59,800
I promised her we will eat at
the restaurant tonight.

520
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:01,719
As you wish.

521
01:09:06,473 --> 01:09:10,227
-Nice ceremony, right?
-Excellent.

522
01:09:13,314 --> 01:09:17,318
-I didn't expect her so young.
-You don't trust me right?

523
01:09:18,235 --> 01:09:21,614
We can't have another day
passing by without talking.

524
01:09:21,989 --> 01:09:26,076
Don't worry. Finish with Angela,
I have proof.

525
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:30,539
For example, at the ceremony
I didn't cry, you did.

526
01:09:30,539 --> 01:09:33,375
-Right.
-And you shouldn't have.

527
01:09:33,542 --> 01:09:35,586
Don't you believe me?

528
01:09:35,836 --> 01:09:40,007
I needed 10 years to get over
it. I finally made it.

529
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:45,179
Lydia, trust me,
it's over.

530
01:09:45,888 --> 01:09:48,349
I traveled with Angela.

531
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:51,894
The excuse was to write
a travel guide.

532
01:09:52,228 --> 01:09:56,565
In reality, I wanted her
out of Madrid and drugs.

533
01:09:56,982 --> 01:10:01,195
Madrid is hell. Our relationship
functioned outside it.

534
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:05,574
After five trips,
I brought her to her parents...

535
01:10:05,574 --> 01:10:09,662
...who kept her away
from drugs and from me.

536
01:10:10,246 --> 01:10:12,331
Did you still love her?

537
01:10:13,874 --> 01:10:17,878
I cried not being able to share
things with her.

538
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:22,841
It's terrible to leave
a person you love so much.

539
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:25,719
What a sad story!

540
01:10:26,345 --> 01:10:29,807
Love is a sad thing when
it ends...

541
01:10:29,807 --> 01:10:32,268
...as the song says.

542
01:10:32,601 --> 01:10:35,271
Marco, we need to talk afterwards.

543
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:39,400
-We've been talking for an hour.
-You have, not me.

544
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:42,111
You're right.

545
01:11:07,553 --> 01:11:10,723
My leg needs two months of therapy,
said the doctor.

546
01:11:11,056 --> 01:11:14,059
But you know what? I am glad
that bull hit me.

547
01:11:14,435 --> 01:11:17,688
Now I can stay with you until
you wake up.

548
01:11:17,688 --> 01:11:20,149
No one will take me away from you.

549
01:11:21,775 --> 01:11:25,029
We got back together,
a month ago...

550
01:11:26,322 --> 01:11:30,159
Lydia would tell you at the
wedding. She didn't in the end.

551
01:11:32,870 --> 01:11:35,581
It was you she cried for.

552
01:11:37,791 --> 01:11:42,171
She called me to tell me
she cried for me.

553
01:11:43,547 --> 01:11:46,300
Last time we spoke.

554
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,678
Now that I don't fight
due to injury...

555
01:11:49,803 --> 01:11:52,848
...I would like to stay
near her during the night.

556
01:11:52,848 --> 01:11:55,142
Like at your place.

557
01:12:31,428 --> 01:12:33,806
I am alone again.

558
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:40,437
You were looking at her breasts.

559
01:12:40,437 --> 01:12:43,524
Difficult to avoid it.
They grow by the day.

560
01:12:43,858 --> 01:12:48,320
Benigno, I am thinking of taking
a trip... I have to work.

561
01:12:48,779 --> 01:12:50,823
And Lydia?

562
01:12:51,323 --> 01:12:53,742
She doesn't need me anymore.

563
01:12:55,661 --> 01:12:57,663
Did you break up?

564
01:12:58,581 --> 01:13:01,500
You can call it that way.

565
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:05,462
I expected this, Marco.
Don't ask why, I just did.

566
01:13:06,964 --> 01:13:11,468
There was something in your
relationship that didn't function right.

567
01:13:11,802 --> 01:13:13,846
When are you going?

568
01:13:13,846 --> 01:13:16,724
Soon, but I'll see you before
I go.

569
01:13:17,016 --> 01:13:19,351
I am so sorry you are going.

570
01:13:24,148 --> 01:13:27,109
I am leaving, Benigno.
I'll see you soon.

571
01:13:29,361 --> 01:13:32,907
She didn't have her period yet?

572
01:13:34,366 --> 01:13:38,329
I am looking at the month's report.
She should have had it.

573
01:13:39,663 --> 01:13:41,999
Yes, it's a bit late.

574
01:13:53,761 --> 01:13:57,640
Two weeks. That's a lot.
Are you sure she had it last month?

575
01:13:58,307 --> 01:14:02,394
I personally dealt with it.
It was when you had the flu.

576
01:14:03,562 --> 01:14:05,856
She seems a bit swollen.

577
01:14:06,273 --> 01:14:08,692
They often have abnormalities.

578
01:14:08,692 --> 01:14:11,987
For example, Lydia
doesn't have a period anymore.

579
01:14:12,446 --> 01:14:16,033
Anyway, we should tell Dr Vega.

580
01:14:33,884 --> 01:14:37,471
I brought some of my guides
for Alicia and you.

581
01:14:39,181 --> 01:14:41,475
I said goodbye to Lydia.

582
01:14:43,018 --> 01:14:47,231
I went to see Alicia, but they
didn't let me enter the room.

583
01:14:49,149 --> 01:14:51,277
Is there something wrong?

584
01:14:51,694 --> 01:14:54,655
No. Just some infection
that Alicia got.

585
01:14:54,864 --> 01:14:57,825
Can you drive me home?
I am done with work.

586
01:14:57,825 --> 01:15:00,911
-It's not serious, I hope.
-I don't know.

587
01:15:00,911 --> 01:15:04,790
They do some medical exams,
but they haven't told me anything.

588
01:15:05,833 --> 01:15:08,836
Brazil...

589
01:15:08,836 --> 01:15:11,088
...Turkey, Cuba.

590
01:15:11,922 --> 01:15:15,009
-I will read them to Alicia.
-They are guides.

591
01:15:15,467 --> 01:15:18,304
Yours. They must be good.

592
01:15:18,304 --> 01:15:20,806
-Are you traveling alone?
-Yes.

593
01:15:21,098 --> 01:15:24,143
I would like to talk to you
about this before you go.

594
01:15:24,435 --> 01:15:27,605
-About what?
-loneliness.

595
01:15:27,771 --> 01:15:30,065
I want to get married.

596
01:15:32,568 --> 01:15:35,613
-Alicia, of course!
-Benigno, you are nuts!

597
01:15:35,613 --> 01:15:38,657
We will get along better than
most couples.

598
01:15:38,657 --> 01:15:41,869
-Why shouldn't I marry her?
-Because she is in a coma!

599
01:15:43,579 --> 01:15:47,124
Because she can't say 'yes'
in the church!

600
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:51,086
Because, she is virtually dead!

601
01:15:51,086 --> 01:15:52,922
Get in the car!

602
01:15:52,922 --> 01:15:55,382
-What are you talking about?
-Get in the car!

603
01:16:01,388 --> 01:16:04,808
Your relationship with Alicia
is a crazy monologue!

604
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:08,604
We often talk to PVS,
but we don't marry them.

605
01:16:09,188 --> 01:16:13,025
Incredible what you are saying.
I had a different opinion of you.

606
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:16,820
Don't say or think about it
ever again!

607
01:16:17,363 --> 01:16:21,951
Promise!...If you say that to
anyone else, you will be in trouble!

608
01:16:24,036 --> 01:16:26,997
If that calms you down,
then I promise.

609
01:16:27,248 --> 01:16:30,292
-Regardless of how much you like her...
-You like her too, right?

610
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:32,378
Of course I like her.

611
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:36,632
-She likes you too.
-She is virtually dead!

612
01:16:36,632 --> 01:16:40,511
She has no feelings about me,
you, or herself!

613
01:16:40,511 --> 01:16:43,013
Understand that!

614
01:16:48,018 --> 01:16:51,814
Our patient Alicia Roncero
was raped and is pregnant.

615
01:16:51,814 --> 01:16:55,109
Before I tell her father
I want you to tell me...

616
01:16:55,109 --> 01:16:58,153
...which bastard did it!

617
01:16:58,153 --> 01:17:00,489
Everyone is upset.

618
01:17:00,489 --> 01:17:04,201
You are responsible. Alicia
was on your floor.

619
01:17:04,451 --> 01:17:07,621
Then allow me to explain the
situation.

620
01:17:08,205 --> 01:17:10,416
Rosa, please.

621
01:17:11,584 --> 01:17:15,337
Alicia's period stopped
two months ago.

622
01:17:15,713 --> 01:17:19,675
I thought it was one month
initially, but I was wrong.

623
01:17:19,884 --> 01:17:22,928
It wasn't in last month's report.

624
01:17:23,137 --> 01:17:26,140
It says it was dealt with normally.

625
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,560
I was down with flu
during that week.

626
01:17:30,519 --> 01:17:33,480
You wrote that.
Right, Benigno?

627
01:17:33,731 --> 01:17:36,775
-It is your typewriting.
-Yes, it was me.

628
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:39,820
Why did you lie?

629
01:17:40,321 --> 01:17:42,781
I didn't want it to become a problem.

630
01:17:42,781 --> 01:17:46,202
On other occasions, the patients'
periods have also stopped.

631
01:17:47,453 --> 01:17:51,415
How come no one noticed?
Where is the night person?

632
01:17:51,624 --> 01:17:54,793
She can't come today.
She phoned.

633
01:17:54,877 --> 01:17:57,046
Didn't see notice anything strange?

634
01:17:57,046 --> 01:18:01,300
She has problems at home.
A lot of nights she doesn't come.

635
01:18:01,509 --> 01:18:04,053
And who replaces her?

636
01:18:07,556 --> 01:18:10,643
I will tell Roncero
that his daughter...

637
01:18:10,976 --> 01:18:13,771
...is day and night with
a nutter?

638
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:16,065
Lets calm down for a bit.

639
01:18:17,650 --> 01:18:22,738
Benigno, do you realize you
are the prime suspect?

640
01:18:23,572 --> 01:18:26,659
Why did you hide the first delay?

641
01:18:26,659 --> 01:18:30,871
What explanation do you have?
Would you ever harm Alicia?

642
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:32,998
Definitely not!

643
01:18:38,379 --> 01:18:41,131
Last night I was
at the parking lot...

644
01:18:41,131 --> 01:18:44,969
...and overheard a discussion
between Benigno and Marco.

645
01:18:45,052 --> 01:18:48,430
Benigno said he wanted to
marry Alicia.

646
01:18:48,806 --> 01:18:52,643
Marco tried to change his mind,
but in vain.

647
01:18:55,396 --> 01:18:57,773
Lots of couples, he said...

648
01:18:57,773 --> 01:19:01,110
...don’t get along
as well as him and Alicia.

649
01:19:03,195 --> 01:19:06,699
AFTER EIGHT MONTHS

650
01:19:22,423 --> 01:19:26,343
It was Lydia Gonzales' funeral
yesterday, at Almudena.

651
01:19:27,511 --> 01:19:32,725
The thirty-year old bullfighter
was in a coma since...

652
01:19:35,769 --> 01:19:38,689
Can I speak with
Benigno Martin?

653
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:40,774
He doesn't work here anymore.

654
01:19:41,859 --> 01:19:44,069
-Are you sure?
-Positive.

655
01:19:44,445 --> 01:19:46,947
-And sister Rosa Lazaga;
-Who are you?

656
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:49,491
-Marco Zuloaga.
-I will put you through.

657
01:19:53,829 --> 01:19:56,790
-Who is it?
-Marco Zuloaga.

658
01:19:57,666 --> 01:20:00,711
I am calling from Jordan.
I found out about Lydia.

659
01:20:00,711 --> 01:20:03,130
I am sorry, Marco.

660
01:20:03,756 --> 01:20:06,133
You should have called me.

661
01:20:07,551 --> 01:20:09,929
We had a lot of problems here.

662
01:20:10,179 --> 01:20:13,307
What happened? Benigno isn't
there anymore, I was told.

663
01:20:13,724 --> 01:20:16,769
Benigno is in jail.

664
01:20:19,605 --> 01:20:23,234
He is accused of raping Alicia.

665
01:20:25,694 --> 01:20:28,739
Help him. He has no one
the poor guy.

666
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:30,783
Did you go see him?

667
01:20:30,783 --> 01:20:33,577
After what he did, I can't.

668
01:20:33,827 --> 01:20:36,956
However he does need help,
and you are his friend.

669
01:20:37,164 --> 01:20:40,543
-What prison is he in?
-In Zegovia.

670
01:21:29,383 --> 01:21:31,886
Wait for me here.

671
01:21:46,692 --> 01:21:50,070
-I want to see a prisoner.
-In the visiting section.

672
01:21:50,070 --> 01:21:52,489
Through this door, on the left.

673
01:22:03,334 --> 01:22:06,337
I want prisoner Benigno Martin.

674
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:09,340
It isn't a visiting day,
but I will see whether...

675
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,467
I am sorry, I can't hear you.

676
01:22:12,593 --> 01:22:14,970
It isn't a visiting day.

677
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:18,766
And the lodger didn't ask
for a visit.

678
01:22:19,266 --> 01:22:22,353
He doesn't know I am in Madrid.
I came today.

679
01:22:22,770 --> 01:22:26,023
-Are you a relative?
-A friend.

680
01:22:26,148 --> 01:22:29,818
-Marco Zuloaga is my name.
-Can I see your I.D.?

681
01:22:32,571 --> 01:22:36,367
-Can I call him?
-He will call you.

682
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:40,120
I have changed number. Can you
give him the new one?

683
01:22:49,046 --> 01:22:51,090
And remember.

684
01:22:51,090 --> 01:22:54,385
Visiting days are Saturday
and Sunday.

685
01:22:54,677 --> 01:22:58,472
But the lodger should ask for
the visit.

686
01:22:58,764 --> 01:23:01,892
If he doesn't want to see you,
there is nothing we can do.

687
01:23:03,394 --> 01:23:07,314
And something else. We don't
have prisoners here...

688
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:12,611
We don't have prisoners here,
we have lodgers.

689
01:23:48,063 --> 01:23:50,316
Marco, is that you?

690
01:23:51,233 --> 01:23:55,404
I am glad to hear your voice.
I asked your visit on Saturday.

691
01:23:57,781 --> 01:23:59,992
-Where are you?
-Outside the clinique.

692
01:24:02,077 --> 01:24:05,998
Dr Vega told me everything.
How could you do it?

693
01:24:06,665 --> 01:24:09,752
Did you come back to Spain
to get on my back?

694
01:24:11,045 --> 01:24:14,006
Do you need anything?
What should I bring you on Saturday?

695
01:24:14,089 --> 01:24:17,593
I need information.
What do you know about Alicia?

696
01:24:17,593 --> 01:24:19,845
They wouldn't say anything
from the clinique.

697
01:24:20,179 --> 01:24:22,306
She is in a different one.
They don't know where.

698
01:24:22,431 --> 01:24:25,184
-I don't believe this.
-Neither do I.

699
01:24:25,184 --> 01:24:27,978
But I am not surprised they
won't tell us.

700
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:31,690
-Are you still my friend?
-Of course. Since I am here.

701
01:24:31,899 --> 01:24:34,109
Then find out about Alicia.

702
01:24:34,485 --> 01:24:37,780
Whether she's alive, whether she gave
birth, whether the baby is alive...

703
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:41,700
I need to know, Marco...
You understand, right?

704
01:24:44,078 --> 01:24:48,541
I will try to...
Talk to you on Saturday...

705
01:24:50,543 --> 01:24:54,046
-Did you find out anything?
-I will. Be patient.

706
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:59,510
I was, until the day she would
give birth. One month ago.

707
01:25:00,177 --> 01:25:02,429
You must wait.

708
01:25:08,394 --> 01:25:12,606
-What do you do during the day here?
-I work in the recovery room.

709
01:25:13,315 --> 01:25:17,820
It's a new prison, few people.
It's quiet in here.

710
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:21,740
-It doesn't look like a prison from outside.
-The problem is elsewhere!

711
01:25:22,157 --> 01:25:25,035
That I don't see Alicia.

712
01:25:25,744 --> 01:25:29,707
The doctor of psychiatry, Dr Roncero
says I am a psychopath.

713
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:36,839
This is good for the trial, they say,
but I don't care about the trial.

714
01:25:37,214 --> 01:25:41,093
I need to see Alicia,
to find out how everything went.

715
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:45,806
If this goes on, I don't
know what I am capable of doing!

716
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:48,184
I am a psychopath, they say?
Then I will act like one!

717
01:25:48,184 --> 01:25:50,144
Don't say that, Benigno!

718
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:55,482
And find me another lawyer.
The one I have despises me.

719
01:25:57,985 --> 01:26:02,031
I will rent my place so that
I can pay him.

720
01:26:02,448 --> 01:26:05,492
I will rent it.
I am currently homeless.

721
01:26:05,492 --> 01:26:08,787
Great. I am glad you will be
my tenant.

722
01:26:09,538 --> 01:26:13,459
I was thinking about you a lot,
especially during the nights.

723
01:26:14,210 --> 01:26:17,588
-Why during the nights?
-Because I study during the nights.

724
01:26:17,796 --> 01:26:20,466
I read all your guides.

725
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:24,220
Like traveling with you
next to me...

726
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:26,597
...telling me things.

727
01:26:26,889 --> 01:26:29,934
I liked Avan's the most.

728
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:32,394
I became one with those people...

729
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:35,523
...that have nothing
and invent everything.

730
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:39,652
And you describing
the Cuban girl...

731
01:26:39,652 --> 01:26:42,571
...in front of her window
by the sea...

732
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:44,615
...waiting in vain...

733
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:48,160
...for something that will
never happen.

734
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:51,747
I was thinking that woman is me.

735
01:27:09,723 --> 01:27:12,893
Good morning. I am Benigno's
friend.

736
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:16,146
You are Marco, the Argentinian?

737
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:21,110
Benigno called me.
Will you take his apartment?

738
01:27:21,944 --> 01:27:26,156
It will be dirty. He wouldn't
let me in to clean it.

739
01:27:27,616 --> 01:27:31,579
-And I didn't want any money...
-It's OK, I will take care of it.

740
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:35,499
Shall I give you the key?...
I will go look for it...

741
01:27:41,964 --> 01:27:43,966
Did you see him?

742
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:47,803
-How is he?
-Well.

743
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:52,933
Poor guy, he wasn't even lucky
during his imprisonment.

744
01:27:52,933 --> 01:27:55,144
No publicity!

745
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:59,231
No TV, no reporters.
No one came here.

746
01:27:59,732 --> 01:28:02,902
They didn't condescend!
And they show such garbage!

747
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:04,945
I would give them an interview!

748
01:28:05,196 --> 01:28:07,740
The media is shit in this country!

749
01:28:07,907 --> 01:28:09,783
You are right.

750
01:28:10,284 --> 01:28:12,328
The keys...

751
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:17,291
Anyway...Do you know why
Benigno is in prison?

752
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:21,837
He is very quiet. He didn't say
a word last time he came.

753
01:28:22,421 --> 01:28:25,382
-Benigno is innocent.
-Yes, I know.

754
01:28:25,633 --> 01:28:28,511
-Innocent about what?
-I don't know.

755
01:28:28,886 --> 01:28:32,014
You do, but you don't want
to tell me.

756
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:40,356
If you need something,
you know where I am.

757
01:30:33,969 --> 01:30:37,765
I was glad you stepped in
by yourself today, without crutches.

758
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:42,978
-How did the exercise go today?
-Very well.

759
01:30:42,978 --> 01:30:45,147
-Were you tired?
-A lot.

760
01:30:45,147 --> 01:30:48,609
It doesn't matter. We will
do some extra exercises.

761
01:30:49,860 --> 01:30:52,530
We will do some stretches.

762
01:30:52,863 --> 01:30:56,534
-But I already did 100.
-We'll do a few more.

763
01:31:32,111 --> 01:31:34,780
I have an appointment with
Mr. Sainz.

764
01:31:39,076 --> 01:31:41,912
The boy was born dead.

765
01:31:42,037 --> 01:31:45,124
Alicia recovered.
Benigno hasn't found out.

766
01:31:45,124 --> 01:31:48,377
In his condition,
he could do something crazy.

767
01:31:48,752 --> 01:31:52,464
I can't lie to him.
He is my only friend.

768
01:31:52,923 --> 01:31:56,385
I will tell him.
I have no problem.

769
01:31:56,385 --> 01:31:59,930
Alicia is still in coma and
the baby dead, I will say.

770
01:32:00,097 --> 01:32:02,933
But you don't tell him anything.

771
01:32:02,933 --> 01:32:07,521
-Can he bail out?
-Very difficult, and expensive.

772
01:32:35,049 --> 01:32:37,718
-You are wet.
-A little.

773
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:42,389
Be careful not to catch a cold.
Drink hot milk with honey.

774
01:32:53,567 --> 01:32:57,363
Since I am here,
I like rainy days.

775
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:02,409
Did you see the new lawyer?

776
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:09,124
He was here...
he told me everything...

777
01:33:11,460 --> 01:33:15,089
-I will loose, right?
-Frankly, yes, you will.

778
01:33:15,089 --> 01:33:18,509
At least nothing happened to
Alicia during birth.

779
01:33:18,926 --> 01:33:23,097
It's the only thing that consoles
me and gives me hope.

780
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:27,017
Are you ok, Benigno?

781
01:33:30,771 --> 01:33:34,233
I would like to hug you
so much, Marco.

782
01:33:35,693 --> 01:33:39,238
But I have to ask for a meeting
face to face.

783
01:33:39,238 --> 01:33:41,282
I tried.

784
01:33:42,783 --> 01:33:45,744
They asked me whether you are
my lover.

785
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:49,915
I didn't dare say 'yes' since
that would annoy you.

786
01:33:50,165 --> 01:33:54,503
It wouldn't annoy me at all.
You can say whatever you want.

787
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:58,299
I have hugged very few people
in my life.

788
01:34:51,393 --> 01:34:53,187
Message!

789
01:34:57,191 --> 01:35:00,945
I was very happy to see you
and say goodbye today.

790
01:35:01,779 --> 01:35:04,323
They won't let me get
out of here...

791
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:07,243
...or they will put me
somewhere else

792
01:35:07,535 --> 01:35:10,162
I don't want to live
without Alicia...

793
01:35:10,162 --> 01:35:13,791
...without being able to hold
not one pin of hers.

794
01:35:14,416 --> 01:35:16,710
Therefore I will escape.

795
01:35:17,002 --> 01:35:20,714
I didn't tell you so that you
won't stop me.

796
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:23,425
I hug you firmly, Marco.

797
01:35:40,526 --> 01:35:43,445
In Zegovia...
Yes, in prison...

798
01:36:02,715 --> 01:36:06,051
I urgently need to see Benigno Martin.

799
01:36:06,343 --> 01:36:09,305
It's a matter of life and death.

800
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:12,600
The warden is waiting for you
in his office.

801
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,227
Me? Where is his office?

802
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:18,189
The guard will accompany you.

803
01:36:25,237 --> 01:36:27,823
Empty your pockets, please.

804
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:43,214
Wait, don't run.

805
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,055
In there at the end.

806
01:36:52,515 --> 01:36:55,559
Good morning. I am
Marco Zuloaga.

807
01:36:56,227 --> 01:36:59,480
Benigno Martin left this
letter for you.

808
01:37:06,695 --> 01:37:08,906
Dear Marco...

809
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:12,868
It's still raining, and this
is a good sign.

810
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:17,706
When Alicia had the accident,
it was raining too.

811
01:37:18,207 --> 01:37:21,877
I am writing to you a few
minutes before I escape.

812
01:37:21,877 --> 01:37:25,422
I hope, with all these,
to fall in a coma as well...

813
01:37:25,422 --> 01:37:27,591
...and to be near her.

814
01:37:28,342 --> 01:37:30,803
You are my only friend.

815
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:35,057
I am leaving you the house
I prepared for me and her.

816
01:37:36,892 --> 01:37:41,188
Wherever they take me, come to
see me and talk to me.

817
01:37:41,772 --> 01:37:45,484
Tell me everything, without
hiding anything.

818
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,487
Goodbye, my friend.

819
01:38:05,713 --> 01:38:09,466
I took these from him and these
I found at his cell.

820
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:20,269
You must sign here.

821
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,447
Benigno, it's me.

822
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:38,245
Alicia is alive...
You woke her up.

823
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:46,003
I got your message and ran
immediately to tell you...

824
01:38:46,253 --> 01:38:48,672
...but it was too late.

825
01:38:48,797 --> 01:38:52,259
I put a pin of Alicia
in your pocket.

826
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:56,764
And a photo of hers.

827
01:38:57,515 --> 01:39:00,518
And a photo of your mother.

828
01:39:01,393 --> 01:39:04,647
So that they can be with you
in eternity.

829
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:29,940
Like wild waves. The male on top,
the female below.

830
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:31,901
I will bring some water.

831
01:41:00,012 --> 01:41:01,931
Are you ok?

832
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:06,727
I don't know...

833
01:41:09,146 --> 01:41:11,482
I am much better now.

834
01:41:24,245 --> 01:41:26,705
Come on, lets go inside.

835
01:41:31,710 --> 01:41:33,671
You tremble.

836
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:36,757
Why?

837
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:50,062
-What did you tell her?
-Nothing.

838
01:41:50,062 --> 01:41:52,064
I saw you talking.

839
01:41:52,064 --> 01:41:55,401
She asked if I am ok, and I
thanked her.

840
01:41:57,236 --> 01:42:01,699
You will see me around.
I live near the dancing school.

841
01:42:02,408 --> 01:42:05,244
In Benigno's place?

842
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:09,248
-Why do you stay there?
-Benigno is dead.

843
01:42:14,295 --> 01:42:17,464
One day, we should talk.

844
01:42:17,756 --> 01:42:21,218
Yes, and it will be simpler
