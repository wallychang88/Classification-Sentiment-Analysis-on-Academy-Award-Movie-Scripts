00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:12,779
Don't just stand there.
Give me a hand with the canopy.

5
00:01:34,468 --> 00:01:37,164
- Mary? Merriman? Are you ready?
- Mary?

6
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,206
[Mary]
yes, Mr. Burkett.

7
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,603

00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,518
- I think she's knocking.
- Well, see what she wants.

11
00:03:33,554 --> 00:03:36,148
I can't open
this wretched thing.

12
00:03:37,658 --> 00:03:39,592
I suppose we better stop.

13
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:01,340
I can't get
this top off.

14
00:04:22,903 --> 00:04:25,269
Hello.
Is everything all right?

15
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:27,170
Are-Are you okay?

16
00:04:27,241 --> 00:04:30,301
- Am I what?
- We're all right, thank you.

17
00:04:30,377 --> 00:04:33,278
Is that Lady Trentham?
Lady Trentham.

18
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:36,976
It's, uh...
I'm William McCordle's cousin, Ivor.

19
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,143
Ivor Novello.

20
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,483
Yes, of course.

21
00:04:41,555 --> 00:04:43,989
May I introduce
a friend of mine from California?

22
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:46,582
- Mr. Morris Weissman.
- Hello.

23
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:49,390
Hi.

24
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:53,160
Uh, we were just wondering if
we were headed in the same direction.

25
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,167
I dare say we might be.

26
00:04:57,237 --> 00:05:00,798
Well, if-If everything
seems to be all right...

27
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:06,412
Bye.

28
00:05:07,548 --> 00:05:10,642
Could we get on
before I freeze to death?

29
00:05:12,453 --> 00:05:15,513
- Was that really Ivor Novello?
- Yes. Could we get on?

30
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:03,194
[Weissman]
Oh, hello. Nice house. I like it.

31
00:06:08,442 --> 00:06:11,536
- [Man] Hello, Ivor.
- Welcome back, your Ladyship.

32
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:13,546
Constance, welcome.

33
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:18,208
Hello, dear. If he has to call me
by my Christian name,

34
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:20,219
Why can't he make it
"Aunt Constance"?

35
00:06:20,287 --> 00:06:22,551
- I'm not the upstairs maid.
- [Whispering, Indistinct]

36
00:06:22,623 --> 00:06:24,750
He's still got that vile
little dog, I see.

37
00:06:24,825 --> 00:06:27,316
Yes, the ones we hate last forever.
Did you have a horrid journey?

38
00:06:27,394 --> 00:06:29,328
Yes, fairly horrid.

39
00:06:30,998 --> 00:06:33,660
Take the car around the back
to unload it.

40
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:41,165
You better follow him.
Mrs. Wilson will look after you.

41
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:47,006
Your Ladyship.

42
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,014
- Your Lordship.
- Mm-Hmm.

43
00:06:54,321 --> 00:06:56,255
- Louisa.
- William.

44
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:58,985
- Raymond. Lots of good shooting coming.
- William.

45
00:06:59,059 --> 00:07:01,926
That's what
we're here for.

46
00:07:01,995 --> 00:07:05,089
Just leave everything in one pile
around the corner there.

47
00:07:05,165 --> 00:07:07,599
Make sure it's properly labeled.
It'll go up in the luggage lift.

48
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:09,898
These are the guns.
Where's the gun room?

49
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,428
Down there on the right.
Find Mr. Strutt, the keeper.
He'll show you what to do.

50
00:07:13,507 --> 00:07:16,601
- I know what to do.
- [Woman] Ellen, what do you
think you’re doing over there?

51
00:07:16,677 --> 00:07:20,044
Take that rain off those cases
before you take them up.

52
00:07:20,113 --> 00:07:22,843
[Woman #2]
Those are Mr. Novello's bags.

53
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:25,885
- Who are you?
- I'm Mr. Weissman’s man.

54
00:07:25,953 --> 00:07:27,887
- The Countess of Trentham.
- Yes.

55
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,889
Make sure they're properly labeled.
Put them down there.

56
00:07:29,957 --> 00:07:32,551
- Where am I?
- You're in the stable block
with the grooms.

57
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:36,027
Her Ladyship is in the Chinese room.
Elsie! Elsie!

58
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:38,997
You'll be sharing
with the head housemaid.
She'll show you where everything is.

59
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,057
Elsie,
this is Miss Trentham.

60
00:07:41,134 --> 00:07:43,466
- Mrs. Wilson... Excuse me, ma'am...
- Take care of her, will you?

61
00:07:43,537 --> 00:07:46,802
My name's Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

62
00:07:46,873 --> 00:07:49,467
Not here it's not.
It's Trentham.

Lord Stockbridge.
Guns.

64
00:07:51,545 --> 00:07:56,073
- Down there on the right.
- The name's Parks. Robert Parks.

65
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:58,549
Mr. Parks?

66
00:07:58,619 --> 00:08:01,486
Mr. Parks, below stairs
you'll be known as Mr. Stockbridge.

67
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:04,922
- There's three more outside.
- I knew a Mr. Parks
who was in service in Norwich.

68
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,926
Is he any relation
of yours?

69
00:08:06,994 --> 00:08:08,928
No.
London born and bred.

70
00:08:08,996 --> 00:08:11,123
What should I do
with Her Ladyship's jewels?

71
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:13,860
It's this way.
George is in charge of the safe.

72
00:08:13,934 --> 00:08:16,698
He's the first footman, and you
wanna watch where he puts his hands.

73
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,204
[Bell Dinging]

74
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,044
She's new.

75
00:08:32,252 --> 00:08:34,311
[Elsie]
Have you got the ones for tonight?

76
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,322
Oh, sorry.

77
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:43,362
Always bring a separate box
for the first night. It saves bother.

78
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:51,403
[Closes Case]

79
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:05,149
- [Chattering, Indistinct]
- Freddie, do wait.

80
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:07,914
For goodness sakes, Mabel.
What is it this time?

81
00:09:07,988 --> 00:09:11,219
- Does my hair look all right?
- It looks fine.
Where the hell were you?

82
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:16,251
We're not late.
Freddie, do please stop going on.

83
00:09:16,329 --> 00:09:18,263
Isobel?

84
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,265
- Hello.
- Hello, Isobel.

85
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:23,791
Darling, I'll see you in there.
There's been something
I've been meaning to say to you.

86
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:31,906
- Have you, uh...
Have you spoken to your father?
- No.

87
00:09:31,978 --> 00:09:35,470
What do you mean, no?
Hey, you promised.

88
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,143
I never promised.
I said I'd do my best.

89
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:40,743
- You're so beautiful
when you resist me.
- Stop it.

90
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:42,880
I'll ask him tonight.

91
00:09:42,956 --> 00:09:45,481
- Well, you bloody well better.
- [Footsteps]

92
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,288
- You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.
- Don't worry. It's nobody.

93
00:09:50,363 --> 00:09:52,593
Sorry, Miss Isobel.

94
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,760
Do you really think you'll have
a chance to speak to him tonight?

95
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,327
- Would you stop going on about it?
- Izzy, that's all very well...

96
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:00,669
I think it's ridiculous.
I'm here to shoot.

97
00:10:00,741 --> 00:10:05,201
Darling, it's a relief to me to sit next
to someone who isn't deaf in one ear.

98
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:07,610
I'm sorry?

99
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:09,615
[Chattering]

100
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:15,076
Darling, what do you mean,
"leave it"?

101
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:17,385
Well, I just meant
let it come naturally.

102
00:10:17,457 --> 00:10:19,755
Don't try and steer
the conversation.

103
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:23,262
- It makes you sound so desperate.
- Well, I am fucking desperate.

104
00:10:25,732 --> 00:10:28,530
Hello, Raymond. This is
my brother-In-Law, Lord Stockbridge.

105
00:10:28,602 --> 00:10:30,536
Hello.
I'm Morris Weissman.

106
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:33,198
- Who?
- Morris Weissman.

107
00:10:33,273 --> 00:10:36,037
- Weissman, yes.
- Hello.

108
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:39,408
Oh, Elsie? Elsie,
this is Lord Stockbridge's valet.

109
00:10:39,479 --> 00:10:41,879
He's new to the house,
so show him around, will you?

110
00:10:41,948 --> 00:10:44,348
You'll be sharing with
Mr. Weissman’s man.

111
00:10:44,417 --> 00:10:46,977
- Has His Lordship's luggage gone up?
- Supposedly.

112
00:10:47,053 --> 00:10:50,022
He's in the Tapestry room,
wherever that is.

113
00:10:50,090 --> 00:10:52,456
Oh, well,
here we go again.

114
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:56,121
[Mary] That's just it. I've never
done a house party before, not properly.

115
00:10:56,196 --> 00:10:58,130
[Elsie] How come you got
taken on as a countess lady's maid...

116
00:10:58,198 --> 00:11:00,894
- if you’ve got no experience?
- She wants to train me.

117
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:02,901
She said she didn't care
about experience.

118
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:05,403
She didn't want
to pay for it, you mean.

119
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,174
It's cold in here.

120
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,733
You should know to pack your woolies
when you come to this house.

121
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:14,940
Here we are.

122
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:17,347
- Is everything all right, Elsie?
- Fine, Miss Lewis. Thanks.

123
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:20,181
That's your bed there.

124
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,949
- That good? Yeah, that's tasty.
- Very tasty.

125
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:25,958
I think I'll...
I shall go in the library.

126
00:11:36,169 --> 00:11:38,603
Here you are, Pip, Pip.

127
00:11:38,672 --> 00:11:41,140
I beg your pardon, sir. I thought
I'd just take the Times up with me...

128
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:45,110
- in case you'd like to read it
when you're dressing.
- Thank you, Probert.

129
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,578
- Look after Pip for me. Good boy.
- Of course, sir.

130
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:50,172
I have to make a telephone call
to California in a couple of hours.

131
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,548
- I can't find a telephone.
- Well, there's a telephone
just here on the left.

132
00:11:52,619 --> 00:11:55,747
Oh, wonderful. Thank you. You know,
of course, I'll reverse the charges.

133
00:11:55,822 --> 00:11:57,756
Yes.

134
00:11:57,824 --> 00:12:00,349
There's a new restaurant in the Strand.
It's an automatic restaurant.

135
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:04,420
It's open 24 hours a day.
You can go in any time day or night.

136
00:12:04,497 --> 00:12:06,465
So who's the funny
little American?

137
00:12:06,533 --> 00:12:09,058
- Morris Weissman.
He's a friend of Ivor.
- Oh.

138
00:12:09,135 --> 00:12:11,126
He makes films in Hollywood.

139
00:12:11,204 --> 00:12:13,900
Ivor asked if he could bring him along.
Didn't see why not.

140
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:16,772
I thought he might be interested
in guns and shooting.

141
00:12:16,843 --> 00:12:19,903
Oh, well, never mind.
He adds to the glamor of the gathering.

142
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,107
I didn't expect anything
half as exotic.

143
00:12:22,182 --> 00:12:25,083
Oh, no, not for me.
You know that I hate drinking whiskey.

144
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:27,085
Go on, drink it.
Do you good.

145
00:12:27,153 --> 00:12:29,212
- Go on.
- [Sighs]

146
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,223
Oh, really, Bill.

147
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,919
You are such
a bad influence.

148
00:12:33,994 --> 00:12:37,452
Well, don't blame me
if I start misbehaving.

149
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,193
[McCordle] I don't know how impressed
your husband is with our Hollywood folk.

150
00:12:41,268 --> 00:12:43,429
Well,
you know Raymond.

151
00:12:43,503 --> 00:12:45,835
He only feels safe
with his own kind.

152
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,965
Bill!
[Chuckles]

153
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:54,112
I thought ladies' maids
never wore aprons.

154
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,172
Her Ladyship used to have a French maid
who wore a black one like this.

155
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:59,241
She thinks it's got
a bit of style.

156
00:12:59,319 --> 00:13:02,379
I bet she does, and I bet
she took it out of your wages too.

157
00:13:02,455 --> 00:13:05,288
She likes to have
everything just so.

158
00:13:05,358 --> 00:13:07,292
Mmm.
Don't they all.

159
00:13:08,828 --> 00:13:11,228
- That's him.
- Who?

160
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:13,232
Ivor Novello.

161
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:16,633
He passed us on the road today
on his way here, and he spoke to me.

162
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:20,161
Well, he spoke to Her Ladyship,
but I answered.

163
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,175
I only cut it out for Garbo.
I prefer the American stars.

164
00:13:23,243 --> 00:13:25,404
I think they've got
more oomph.

165
00:13:25,478 --> 00:13:27,844
Go on!

166
00:13:27,914 --> 00:13:30,747
- Is he really Sir William’s cousin?
- Yep.

167
00:13:30,817 --> 00:13:33,081
Imagine having a film star
in the family.

168
00:13:33,153 --> 00:13:36,748
- Lady Sylvia must be thrilled.
- Oh, I don't think.

169
00:13:36,823 --> 00:13:38,757
Why wouldn’t she be?

170
00:13:38,825 --> 00:13:40,793
'Cause she's a snobbish cow.
'Cause she...

171
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,227
she looks down on anyone who got
to the top with brains and hard work.

172
00:13:44,297 --> 00:13:47,027
Just like she looks down on her husband,
except when it's time to foot the bills.

173
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,125
And then she's got
her hand out, all right.

174
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:52,262
- What was her family, then?
- What'd you expect, really?

175
00:13:52,339 --> 00:13:54,671
Toffee-Nosed and useless.

176
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:56,675
Her father was
the Earl of Carton.

177
00:13:56,743 --> 00:13:58,904
Sounds good, except
he didn't have a pot to piss in.

178
00:13:58,979 --> 00:14:01,277
What's she like
to work for?

179
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:04,875
She's horrible.
But he's...

180
00:14:04,951 --> 00:14:07,146
He's okay. Come on.
We better get cracking.

181
00:14:10,323 --> 00:14:13,121
- Hello, I'm Ivor.
- I know who you are.

182
00:14:13,193 --> 00:14:15,957
- Mabel Nesbitt.
- Hello, Mabel.

183
00:14:16,029 --> 00:14:19,055
- [Mabel] How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

184
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,397
Oh! I don't smoke.
Thank you.

185
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:26,735
[Elsie] Mrs. Nesbitt's
only got one dress with her.

186
00:14:26,806 --> 00:14:29,172
Says her husband rushed her
when she was packing.

187
00:14:29,242 --> 00:14:31,733
Do you always look after visitors
if they haven't got a maid?

188
00:14:31,811 --> 00:14:33,745
Sometimes Dorothy helps,
though why Mrs. Wilson...

189
00:14:33,813 --> 00:14:36,213
makes the still room maid
do it beats me.

190
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:38,307
I think she only does it
to annoy Mrs. Croft.

191
00:14:38,385 --> 00:14:41,912
- Which one does Dorothy answer to?
- Both. That's the problem.

192
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:44,149
She's rushed off her feet as it is.
Are you nearly done there?

193
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:47,057
- Yes.
- Here she is... Miss Bossy.

194
00:14:47,127 --> 00:14:49,095
Tell me, what was Greta Garbo
really like?

195
00:14:49,162 --> 00:14:52,757
- Did you get to know her?
- [Novello] yes, I did, actually.

196
00:14:52,832 --> 00:14:55,562
She's coming to stay
with me next month.

197
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:58,365
[Gasps]

198
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:02,340
Tell me, how much longer are you
going to go on... making films?

199
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,311
I suppose that rather depends
on how much longer the public
want to see me in them.

200
00:15:07,547 --> 00:15:09,481
Yes, it must be hard
to know...

201
00:15:09,549 --> 00:15:12,143
when it's time
to throw in the towel.

202
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:15,779
What a pity about
that last one of yours.

203
00:15:15,855 --> 00:15:18,289
What-What was it called?

204
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:21,521
- The Dodger.
- The Lodger.

205
00:15:21,594 --> 00:15:23,960
The Lodger.

206
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,595
And it must be
so disappointing...

207
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:30,500
when something just, you know,
flops like that.

208
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,164
Yes, it is...

209
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:35,673
rather disappointing.

210
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:38,575
Look at this.
Machine-Made lace.

211
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,079
- Hark at her.
- Well, I hate cheap clothes.

212
00:15:41,147 --> 00:15:44,082
They're twice the work,
and they never look as good.

213
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,109
I'll murder that dog one day.
Look at that. All over his waistcoat.

214
00:15:48,188 --> 00:15:51,021
What do you expect from a woman
without her own maid?

215
00:15:51,091 --> 00:15:55,323
Lady Lavinia says a woman who travels
with no maid has lost her self-Respect.

216
00:15:55,395 --> 00:15:59,229
- She calls it "giving in."
- I don't have a maid.
I haven't given in.

217
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:01,563
- [Sarah] That's different.
- [Elsie] why?

218
00:16:01,634 --> 00:16:05,297
- What's your name?
- I think here I'm called Trentham.

219
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:08,135
No, I meant your real name.

220
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:12,042
Oh. Mary.
Mary Maceachran.

221
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:15,240
Blimey. What does
Her Ladyship call you?

222
00:16:15,315 --> 00:16:18,716
Well, she should call me Maceachran,
now I'm a lady's maid.

223
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:20,719
That's what my mother says.

224
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:23,881
But Her Ladyship can't pronounce it,
so she calls me Mary.

225
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,891
I don't blame her.

226
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,161
Sylvia.

227
00:16:32,665 --> 00:16:34,724
I'm serious.
There mustn't be anymore nonsense.

228
00:16:34,801 --> 00:16:36,769
I don't know what
you're talking about.

229
00:16:36,836 --> 00:16:39,270
[Clock Chiming]

230
00:16:40,673 --> 00:16:42,607
Done much shooting
this year?

231
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:45,235
[Stockbridge]
Quite a lot.

232
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,371
- Hello.
- Does Louisa always go out with you?

233
00:16:48,448 --> 00:16:50,882
- Usually.
- It's very good of her.

234
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,180
- Do you have a minute?
- Don't do that! That's bad for him!

235
00:16:53,253 --> 00:16:55,585
Put him down.

236
00:16:55,655 --> 00:16:58,954
- [Pip whimpers]
- Yeah. Bores me stiff.

237
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,959
- All right, Pip.
- I just wondered...

238
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:02,961
[Sylvia]
William’s such a rotten shot.

239
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:05,520
I usually try and duck out of it,
particularly in Scotland.

240
00:17:05,598 --> 00:17:07,566
I'm rather fond
of Scotland.

241
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:11,367
All right,
get on with your work. Yes?

242
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:14,565
- Ah, Mr. Weissman. There you are.
- I'm dealing with this.

243
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:18,873
- What is it, Mr. Weissman?
- Well, to start with,
my name is Denton.

244
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,846
- Henry Denton.
- You're here as valet to Mr. Weissman.

245
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:26,011
That means you'll be known
as Mr. Weissman below stairs
for the duration of your stay.

246
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:29,816
We stick to the old customs here.
It saves confusion.

247
00:17:29,889 --> 00:17:31,982
- It's about Mr. Weissman’s diet.
- Yes?

248
00:17:33,326 --> 00:17:35,658
He's a vegetarian.

249
00:17:35,728 --> 00:17:38,219
- A what?
- A vegetarian.

250
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:42,428
He doesn't eat meat.
He eats fish, but not meat.

251
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:47,228
Well, I never!
Doesn't eat meat?

252
00:17:47,307 --> 00:17:50,071
He's coming for a shooting party,
and he doesn't eat meat.

253
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:52,668
Mr. Weissman doesn't
intend to shoot.

254
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:56,272
I think he just wants to walk
out with them, get a bit of air.

255
00:17:56,349 --> 00:17:58,283
Get a bit of air?

256
00:17:58,351 --> 00:18:00,649
Yes, thank you.
We'll make the necessary arrangements.

257
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,247
Now I suggest you get one of
the servants to take you upstairs.

258
00:18:04,324 --> 00:18:06,258
Mr. Weissman is in
the Green bedroom,

259
00:18:06,326 --> 00:18:08,317
And you'll be sharing with
Lord Stockbridge’s valet...

260
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:10,328
Robert Parks.

261
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:15,566
[Women Chuckling]

262
00:18:17,103 --> 00:18:20,436
He's very full of himself, I must say.
"Doesn't eat meat."

263
00:18:20,506 --> 00:18:23,942
Now, now, Mrs. Croft. We don't want
to be thought unsophisticated, do we?

264
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,174
Mr. Weissman’s an American.
They do things differently there.

265
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,384
Good boy, now.
Give Louisa a kiss from me.

266
00:18:32,452 --> 00:18:34,386
[Novello]
Darling, I'm sorry about that.

267
00:18:34,454 --> 00:18:37,514
- I should have made it clear
that Morris just doesn't shoot.
- [Sylvia] Don't worry.

268
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,717
William’s just making a fuss.
He has this ridiculous idea...

269
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,056
that Americans all sleep
with guns under their pillows.

270
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,961
They do, but they're more for
each other than for killing birds.

271
00:18:45,031 --> 00:18:48,728
[Clears Throat] Remind me.
How are you related to William exactly?

272
00:18:48,801 --> 00:18:52,362
[Novello]
Our mothers were first cousins.

273
00:18:52,438 --> 00:18:54,372
[Stockbridge] Don't believe
I ever met William’s mother.

274
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:57,375
Didn't she do something
rather original?

275
00:18:57,443 --> 00:19:00,674
Well, she was a teacher.

276
00:19:00,747 --> 00:19:03,215
And so was mine.

277
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:06,446
- That's marvelous, isn't it?
- [Constance]Sylvia is so clever.

278
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,750
She always finds
such wonderful servants.

279
00:19:09,822 --> 00:19:11,881
I don't know how she manages.

280
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,892
I'm breaking in
a new maid.

281
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,019
I'm simply worn out
with it.

282
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,859
Actually, there's nothing
more exhausting, is there?

283
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:22,662
- I don't have a lady's maid.
- Oh. Hello.

284
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:25,704
I was just telling dear Mabel here
about my new maid.

285
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:29,333
Honestly, the amount I have to do
for her, she should be paying me.

286
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,468
She does seem
rather young.

287
00:19:31,544 --> 00:19:35,173
Well, of course, what she is,
my dear, is wonderfully cheap.

288
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:37,375
You've no right to pull me away
in mid-Conversation.

289
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,146
Mabel, where are you going?
The room's this way.

290
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,312
Why the hell did you have to mention
you don't have a maid?

291
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,084
Why would you mention you didn't
have a maid, for God's sake?

292
00:19:56,135 --> 00:19:59,730
You'd find it a lot easier to clean
them if you put the trees in first.

293
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:01,740
I was just about
to do that.

294
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:05,968
Are these
Mr. Novello's shoes?

295
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:07,979
Yes.

296
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:19,290
- Do you really live in Hollywood?
- I do.

297
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:22,351
Hmm. How did you get there?
Where did you start from?

298
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:25,625
Where else do you think?
Scotland.

299
00:20:25,698 --> 00:20:27,632
Were you always
in service?

300
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,931
Did you ever think of trying to
get into films while you were there?

301
00:20:31,003 --> 00:20:34,632
I wanted to be an actor once...
when I was little.

302
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:38,837
I suppose
old Mother Trentham...

303
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:41,471
will have her begging bowl out
while she's here.

304
00:20:41,547 --> 00:20:44,015
She won't be bothering
your employers, that's certain.

305
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,847
- Why not?
- [Elsie]
Because Lady Lavinia Meredith...

306
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:49,945
- hasn't got a penny
to bless herself with.
- And whose fault is that?

307
00:20:50,022 --> 00:20:51,990
There's nothing wrong
with the commander.

308
00:20:52,058 --> 00:20:54,151
He's just been a bit
unfortunate.

309
00:20:54,227 --> 00:20:56,957
I'll say.
I think he's pathetic.

310
00:20:57,029 --> 00:20:59,623
Then why don't you
hand in your notice?

311
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:02,133
Well, the other two sisters
fell on their feet.

312
00:21:02,201 --> 00:21:04,135
Of course, it helps
that they're both good-Looking.

313
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,671
- [Mary] Lady Sylvia's lovely.
- You think so?

314
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,640
- She might have done a bit
better for herself, really.
- [Elsie] I beg your pardon.

315
00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:12,735
Lord Carton was determined to have sir
William for either of the two eldest.

316
00:21:12,812 --> 00:21:14,746
I was told he could have
had his pick.

317
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:17,783
- Why was Lord Carton so keen?
- Why do you think?

318
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:22,082
Who do you suppose pays
for him to swan around Biarritz
for six months of the year?

319
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,716
Come to that, who keeps Ma Trentham
in stockings and gin?

320
00:21:25,792 --> 00:21:29,853
- Old money bags, that's who.
- I think it's disgusting
the way they all use him.

321
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:33,092
None of the rest of them
have got the brains to make
the price of a packet of tea.

322
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,135
- Are you finished, Elsie?
- Yes, Mrs. Wilson.

323
00:21:36,202 --> 00:21:39,069
- I've just got this hem to do.
- What's Lord Stockbridge like?

324
00:21:39,138 --> 00:21:41,629
He thinks
he's God Almighty.

325
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:43,641
They all do.

326
00:22:00,126 --> 00:22:03,653
- Why does this fork go on the right?
- [Chuckles]

327
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:06,664
Because they eat the fish
with two of them.

328
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:10,361
- One in each hand.
- Why is that, then?

329
00:22:10,436 --> 00:22:13,599
- Search me.
- [George] what are you doing here?

330
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:17,404
- Just looking around.
- Mr. Jennings will be up in a minute.

331
00:22:17,477 --> 00:22:20,412
If I were you,
I'd go and look around somewhere else.

332
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,916
- Is that what you'd do?
- That's exactly what I would do.

333
00:22:23,983 --> 00:22:25,917
Then that's what
I'll do.

334
00:22:28,588 --> 00:22:31,421
- Something funny about that bloke.
- His accent for a start.

335
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:33,755
- What do you think his game is?
- I don't know.

336
00:22:33,826 --> 00:22:38,320
Are you finished? What about
Lord Rupert Standish and Mr. Blond?

337
00:22:38,397 --> 00:22:41,264
Her Ladyship said
not to wait for them.

338
00:22:41,334 --> 00:22:43,268
The stuffs all ready
if they turn up on time.

339
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:45,566
We can stick on
two extra places in a jiffy.

340
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:49,540
When they arrive, you'll be
dressing Mr. Blond, Arthur.

341
00:22:49,609 --> 00:22:52,043
- Mr. Blond?
- Yes, Mr. Blond.

342
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:54,545
George, you'll have
Lord Rupert.

343
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,946
If they're very late,
they can change by themselves,

344
00:22:57,016 --> 00:22:58,984
And you can tidy up
when they're downstairs.

345
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:00,985
Is Mr. Nesbitt
settled?

346
00:23:01,053 --> 00:23:03,078
I'll go and finish
him off now, sir.

347
00:23:03,155 --> 00:23:07,615
- And Mr. Novello?
- Mr. Weissman’s man will attend to him.

348
00:23:08,928 --> 00:23:11,556
Right.
After you're finished,

349
00:23:11,631 --> 00:23:13,724
Join me in the drawing room
with the drinks.

350
00:23:17,537 --> 00:23:20,233
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

351
00:23:21,674 --> 00:23:24,370
Only I thought I'd be doing
Mr. Novello, that's all.

352
00:23:24,443 --> 00:23:26,604
Now you won't get to see him
in his under drawers.

353
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,045
Never mind.
Better luck next time.

354
00:23:33,986 --> 00:23:36,250
They're rather
a mixed bunch.

355
00:23:36,322 --> 00:23:38,290
That Mr. Weissman’s
very odd.

356
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:40,848
Apparently, he produces
motion pictures.

357
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:44,590
The Charlie Chan mysteries.
Or does he direct them?

358
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:46,928
I never know the difference.

359
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:49,991
Really?
I enjoy those, milady.

360
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:52,003
Ye... Mary.

361
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,301
I suppose it's fun
having a film star staying.

362
00:23:54,373 --> 00:23:59,902
There's always so little to talk about
after the first flush of recognition.

363
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:03,813
And why has Freddie Nesbitt brought
that awful, common little wife of his?

364
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:07,319
I mean, Isobel only asked him
because a gun dropped out.

365
00:24:07,386 --> 00:24:10,048
That's no excuse
to inflict her on us all.

366
00:24:10,122 --> 00:24:12,852
Mary!
[Sighs]

367
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:15,359
So what's the gossip
in the servants' hall?

368
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:18,989
- Um, nothing, milady.
- Hmm?

369
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:21,295
Nonsense.
Come on. Out with it.

370
00:24:22,568 --> 00:24:24,866
Well, is it true
that Sir William...

371
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:28,395
could have married Lady Stockbridge
if he'd wanted to?

372
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:32,439
Is that what
they're saying?

373
00:24:32,511 --> 00:24:35,969
Only that Lord Carton was
after Sir William for one of them,

374
00:24:36,048 --> 00:24:37,982
But he didn't care which.

375
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,247
What would you say
if I told you...

376
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,618
they cut cards for him?

377
00:24:44,824 --> 00:24:47,258
William, Lewis said
you wanted me.

378
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:49,521
- Who's next to me at dinner?
- Oh, you know.

379
00:24:49,595 --> 00:24:51,529
Aunt Constance
and Lavinia.

380
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:53,792
Why do I have to have
that bloody old trout all the time?

381
00:24:53,866 --> 00:24:57,597
- I want Louisa.
- Do I have to explain
the table of precedence again?

382
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:00,503
- I don't give a shit about precedence.
- Well, you always complain...

383
00:25:00,573 --> 00:25:02,905
that people look down on you,
and then you behave like a peasant.

384
00:25:02,975 --> 00:25:05,443
Now, tomorrow morning,
I'll...

385
00:25:05,511 --> 00:25:08,275
I'll breakfast in bed,

386
00:25:08,347 --> 00:25:10,281
And then get straight up
into the tweeds.

387
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:12,283
What shirt
have you brought?

388
00:25:12,351 --> 00:25:14,979
Um, the green
with the pink stripe.

389
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:17,887
Oh, no, dear. No.
That's quite wrong.

390
00:25:17,957 --> 00:25:20,619
No, always something
very plain for country sports.

391
00:25:20,693 --> 00:25:23,594
The one I had on today
will do.

392
00:25:23,663 --> 00:25:27,292
- But it's soiled.
- Yeah, well, you can wash it,
can’t you?

393
00:25:29,502 --> 00:25:32,130
God. I hate shooting.

394
00:25:33,906 --> 00:25:36,568
Why does one
have to do these things?

395
00:25:36,642 --> 00:25:38,906
[McCordle]
Has Constance asked for money yet?

396
00:25:38,978 --> 00:25:40,912
- No.
- Raymond tells me...

397
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,074
she's been complaining that
her allowance isn't big enough.

398
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,050
Good mind to stop it
completely.

399
00:25:46,118 --> 00:25:48,746
- I thought it was for her lifetime.
- [Laughs]

400
00:25:48,821 --> 00:25:50,789
No, no.

401
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:56,051
- Will that be all, sir?
- Mmm.

402
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:58,426
I do wish that Anthony
wasn't here.

403
00:25:58,497 --> 00:26:00,431
Make sure I'm not
left alone with him, will you?

404
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:03,161
- [Sylvia] why?
- I'm pulling out of his scheme.

405
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:05,499
Oh.
Have you told him?

406
00:26:05,571 --> 00:26:07,505
No, and I'm not
going to either.

407
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:10,508
Louisa said I should leave it
till next week.

408
00:26:10,576 --> 00:26:12,840
Let him sob in private.

409
00:26:12,912 --> 00:26:15,813
Go. Say hello to your mommy.
Go on.

410
00:26:15,881 --> 00:26:17,974
Far be it from me
to contradict Louisa.

411
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:21,349
[Whimpers]

412
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,184
- Will there be anything else?
- Just get Pip.
He might fall down the stairs.

413
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:26,816
Hey, hey, come here.
Come here.

414
00:26:26,892 --> 00:26:29,952
Thank you, Elsie.
You keep hold of him.

415
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:32,327
- Is everything all right?
- Cheap dress, wrong shoes.

416
00:26:32,398 --> 00:26:35,333
I'm making bricks without straw,
Mr. Probert, really.

417
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:38,802
- You don't have any
spare hairpins, do you?
- Yeah.

418
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:41,863
I'm trying to get back to the room
for a second, and I can't find it.

419
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:43,875
It's the staircase
at the end of the corridor.

420
00:26:43,943 --> 00:26:46,571
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah.

421
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:48,806
Oh, Pip.
Oh, thank you, Elsie.

422
00:26:48,881 --> 00:26:51,406
Thank you. Oh!
You've got some hair on your dress.

423
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,543
- Thank you, sir.
- Yes.

424
00:27:02,161 --> 00:27:05,358
[Nesbitt] Shut up, Mabel! There is
nothing going on between me and Isobel.

425
00:27:05,431 --> 00:27:07,763
Can't you just tell me the truth?
You're a liar, Freddie.

426
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:09,767
- There is nothing...
- You are a liar!

427
00:27:09,835 --> 00:27:12,395
- Don't you call me a liar!
- [Knocking On Door]

428
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,903
I found some pins, madam,
from Lady Trentham's maid.

429
00:27:19,979 --> 00:27:22,573
Right.

430
00:27:22,648 --> 00:27:24,582
We're supposed to be
downstairs already.

431
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,118
Well, you go on.
[Sniffles]

432
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:29,120
I'll be down
in a minute.

433
00:27:33,325 --> 00:27:37,489
- [Door Opens]
- Try and make her look respectable.

434
00:27:39,665 --> 00:27:41,599
[Door Closes]

435
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,360
Oh, thank you.

436
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:52,076
Well... there's no harm
in trying.

437
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:03,053
[Weissman]
well, thank you very much, Mr. Jennings.

438
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:05,647
- Just Jennings, sir.
- All right.

439
00:28:05,724 --> 00:28:07,658
Just Jennings.
[Chuckles]

440
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:10,661
Oh, by the way, I've booked
a telephone call to California,

441
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:14,426
And I'd appreciate it if you would
get me as soon as it comes through.

442
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,434
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you, Jennings.

443
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:28,206
You're not gonna provide
entertainment?

444
00:28:30,182 --> 00:28:32,275
That's how you got
your invitation.

445
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,715
- [Stops]
- Oh, no, don't get up.

446
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:39,952
- Please, go on.
- You look lovely in that dress,
if I may say so.

447
00:28:40,025 --> 00:28:43,722
- [Resumes]
- What is it? I don't recognize it.

448
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:46,264
[Novello]
A little something I'm working on.

449
00:28:46,332 --> 00:28:50,132
I can't imagine how one
ever goes about inventing a tune.

450
00:28:50,202 --> 00:28:52,466
Where do you start?

451
00:28:52,538 --> 00:28:54,506
It's rather difficult
to say.

452
00:28:56,408 --> 00:28:58,433
Well, I think
you're too clever for words.

453
00:28:58,510 --> 00:29:00,444
- Good evening.
- Hello.

454
00:29:00,512 --> 00:29:02,810
- Lovely dress.
- Thank you.

455
00:29:06,018 --> 00:29:07,952
Hi.

456
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,520
How do you manage
to put up with these people?

457
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,583
Well, you forget I earn my living
by impersonating them.

458
00:29:22,334 --> 00:29:24,768
Can I help you?

459
00:29:24,837 --> 00:29:29,774
You know, I really enjoy the way
you do things, Mr. Jennings.

460
00:29:29,842 --> 00:29:32,538
I beg your pardon?

461
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:34,545
- What is it, Henry?
- Nothing.

462
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:38,947
I just wanted to be sure
you had everything you need, sir.

463
00:29:40,185 --> 00:29:42,210
Yes, I do.
Thank you.

464
00:29:45,457 --> 00:29:48,824
It's wonderful to find a servant
these days who really shows
an interest, don’t you think?

465
00:29:48,894 --> 00:29:50,828
Sir.

466
00:29:51,897 --> 00:29:53,831
[Chattering, Indistinct]

467
00:30:01,206 --> 00:30:05,040
Come on, girls. Sit down.
Tuck in. We've got 20 minutes.

468
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,044
[Chattering Continues]

469
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:15,446
[George]
Shuffle along. Here he comes.

470
00:30:17,022 --> 00:30:19,957
- Everything satisfactory, Mr. Jennings?
- Yes, thank you, Dorothy.

471
00:30:20,025 --> 00:30:24,018
They have their drinks.
I think we can all take
our leisure for half an hour or so.

472
00:30:24,096 --> 00:30:26,030
What's this?

473
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:28,862
- I believe this is my place,
Mr. Jennings.
- Oh.

474
00:30:28,934 --> 00:30:31,562
And since when did a baroness
outrank a countess?

475
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:36,740
Miss Trentham, would you
take the place of honor, please?

476
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,936
- Miss Trentham?
- [Clears Throat]

477
00:30:39,011 --> 00:30:41,445
I'm all right here,
Mr. Jennings. Thank you.

478
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:43,606
Go on.
Don't keep him waiting.

479
00:30:45,951 --> 00:30:47,885
[Jennings]
Ah, Miss Meredith.

480
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:50,786
Would you come and sit
on my left?

481
00:30:50,856 --> 00:30:52,847
Naturally, I'm nothing when
there are visitors in the house.

482
00:30:52,925 --> 00:30:54,859
- Never mind. I'm used to it.
- Good evening, Mrs. Wilson.

483
00:30:54,927 --> 00:30:56,792
Good evening.

484
00:30:59,498 --> 00:31:01,591
[All]
For what we are about to receive,

485
00:31:01,667 --> 00:31:03,601
May the Lord make us
truly grateful.

486
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:05,796
[Jennings] Right.
Start when you get it.

487
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:07,805
No time for loitering.

488
00:31:10,876 --> 00:31:13,276
I'm not serving tonight,
Mr. Jennings, am I?

489
00:31:13,345 --> 00:31:16,143
Not tonight, Elsie,
but probably tomorrow.

490
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,509
Where is Mrs. Croft?

491
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:21,519
Always eats
with her own staff.

492
00:31:21,587 --> 00:31:25,023
Does she take her pudding to
Mrs. Wilson’s room? Our cook does that.

493
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,116
Fat chance.
They hate each other.

494
00:31:28,193 --> 00:31:31,492
- Can I ask a question?
- Certainly, Mr. Weissman.

495
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:33,497
How can we help you?

496
00:31:33,565 --> 00:31:37,831
I just wondered, how many people here
had parents in service?

497
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:40,929
And was that why
they chose to go into it?

498
00:31:41,006 --> 00:31:45,841
What an interesting question,
and one to which, I'm afraid,
I cannot provide the answer.

499
00:31:45,911 --> 00:31:50,405
All of you whose parents
were in service, raise your hand.

500
00:31:50,482 --> 00:31:53,076
- My father was.
- Both... nanny and groom.

501
00:31:53,152 --> 00:31:56,246
- Not you, Dorothy?
- My father was a farmer, Mr. Jennings.

502
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:58,915
A tenant of Lord Carton's.

503
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:01,789
- Mr. Meredith?
- Factory hands, both of them.

504
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,192
- And if you ask me,
they were better off.
- [Chuckles]

505
00:32:04,263 --> 00:32:08,597
What about you,
Mr. Stockbridge?

506
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,726
[George]
what's the matter? Don’t you know?

507
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,930
Yeah, I know
what they did.

508
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:16,532
But it didn't have any effect
on me or my choice of work.

509
00:32:16,608 --> 00:32:19,509
- And why's that?
- Because I grew up in an orphanage.

510
00:32:25,551 --> 00:32:27,485
[Jennings]
Thank you, Mr. Weissman,

511
00:32:27,553 --> 00:32:30,249
For giving us all
a little something to think about.

512
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,364
Oh, Her Ladyship.

513
00:32:47,439 --> 00:32:51,034
[Sylvia]
Oh, I'm so sorry to disturb you.

514
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,011
Please, do sit down
and finish your supper.

515
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:56,343
Mrs. Wilson, a major crisis has arisen.
I have just found out...

516
00:32:56,415 --> 00:32:59,282
that Mr. Weissman won't eat meat,
and I don't know what to do.

517
00:32:59,351 --> 00:33:01,478
I can't tell Mrs. Croft.
I simply don't dare.

518
00:33:01,553 --> 00:33:03,487
Everything's under control,
your Ladyship.

519
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:05,523
Mr. Weissman’s valet informed us
as soon as he arrived,

520
00:33:05,591 --> 00:33:07,684
So we've prepared
a special version of the soup.

521
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:09,750
He can eat the fish
and the hors d'oeuvres,

522
00:33:09,828 --> 00:33:11,762
And we'll have a welsh rarebit
for the game course.

523
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:15,527
I don't know what we're going
to do about the entree,
but we'll think of something.

524
00:33:15,601 --> 00:33:18,729
Thank you, Mrs. Wilson.
Ten steps ahead as usual.

525
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:21,432
Which one of you
is Mr. Weissman’s valet?

526
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:24,032
I am, your Ladyship.

527
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:27,611
Are you, indeed?
Yes, heavens.

528
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,514
Um, thank you for your...
efficiency.

529
00:33:38,056 --> 00:33:40,616
- You're all set, then.
- [Jennings] yes, George?

530
00:33:40,692 --> 00:33:42,626
Nothing, sir.

531
00:33:42,694 --> 00:33:45,754
I should hope not.
I'm very hungry.

532
00:33:45,831 --> 00:33:47,765
[Chattering]

533
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:02,171
I was, uh,
wondering, William,

534
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:04,875
If I could have a word
with you alone after dinner.

535
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,884
I can't leave my guests,
can I?

536
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,354
You'll make that dog sick.

537
00:34:10,422 --> 00:34:12,390
Isobel, did you know
that William and I...

538
00:34:12,457 --> 00:34:14,584
are going into business
together in the Sudan?

539
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,458
- No, I didn't know that.
- It's quite exciting.

540
00:34:17,529 --> 00:34:19,463
What's happened is
apparently,

541
00:34:19,531 --> 00:34:22,125
There are hundreds and hundreds
of Sudanese native soldiers,

542
00:34:22,201 --> 00:34:24,635
Entire regiments
wandering around the desert,

543
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:27,433
Willy-Nilly, without
anything on their feet,

544
00:34:27,506 --> 00:34:30,100
Which causes some hardship,
I imagine.

545
00:34:30,175 --> 00:34:32,973
No, I grew up
in Leicester.

546
00:34:33,045 --> 00:34:36,208
- My father had a glove factory.
- Really?

547
00:34:36,281 --> 00:34:39,273
One thing I do know is
how a glove should fit.

548
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:42,343
Really, darling. You're boring
poor Mr. Novello to death.

549
00:34:42,421 --> 00:34:44,355
[Mouthing words]

550
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:48,086
- [Novello] No!
- [Weissman] I think he's going
to explain everything to me...

551
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,526
and kind of show me
how it all works.

552
00:34:50,596 --> 00:34:53,827
There's gonna be a pheasant hunt
in my picture.

553
00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:57,300
There's a large market in modernizing
the armies in the Sudan...

554
00:34:57,369 --> 00:34:59,303
and providing them
with boots.

555
00:34:59,371 --> 00:35:02,568
[Woman]And then the old bag
Just served it to all the servants.

556
00:35:02,641 --> 00:35:04,575
I couldn't believe it.

557
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:06,838
Aren't you cold?

558
00:35:06,912 --> 00:35:09,005
It's better
than that kitchen.

559
00:35:12,584 --> 00:35:14,984
Here. I thought
you could do with this.

560
00:35:15,053 --> 00:35:17,283
- Oh, that's kind, love.
- [Vehicle Approaching]

561
00:35:22,594 --> 00:35:24,528
[Man]
Elsie, hello.

562
00:35:24,596 --> 00:35:27,827
- Good evening, your Lordship.
- We've got bags and guns
and everything and no man.

563
00:35:27,899 --> 00:35:29,833
If I give you the keys,
will you sort it out for me?

564
00:35:29,901 --> 00:35:31,835
- Of course, your Lordship.
- Thank you.

565
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:34,064
- We'll get your bags, sir.
- Thank you. That's very kind of you.

566
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:36,073
Good evening.

567
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:39,176
Right.
In the boot, is it?

568
00:35:42,514 --> 00:35:45,005
Sorry, can I trouble you
for a light, please?

569
00:35:45,083 --> 00:35:47,017
- You got that bag?
- Yeah.

570
00:35:52,991 --> 00:35:54,925
Thank you.
Good evening.

571
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:59,430
[Meredith] you mean you think he's
losing interest in that sort of thing?

572
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:01,693
Well, not just that.
The whole Empire.

573
00:36:01,767 --> 00:36:03,792
I think he said
the steam's gone out of it.

574
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:07,066
[Chuckles]
William?

575
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:09,903
That's not true, is it...
that you think the Empire's finished?

576
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:12,034
I've been what?

577
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:14,044
Well, the Empire was
finished after the war.

578
00:36:14,112 --> 00:36:16,945
Well, because of the war.
It changed everything.

579
00:36:17,015 --> 00:36:20,576
- Empire Leicester square?
- Well, I don't care
what's changed or not changed.

580
00:36:20,652 --> 00:36:23,314
As long as our sons are spared
what you all went through.

581
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:26,619
Oh, not all.
You didn't fight, did you, William?

582
00:36:26,692 --> 00:36:28,751
I did my bit.

583
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:30,886
[Sylvia]
well, you made a lot of money,

584
00:36:30,962 --> 00:36:35,262
But it's not quite the same thing as
charging into the cannon's mouth, is it?

585
00:36:35,334 --> 00:36:37,268
Thank God for Raymond.
At least the family...

586
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:39,896
had one representative
in the front line.

587
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:44,169
Raymond, tell them how many times
you were mentioned in the dispatches.

588
00:36:44,242 --> 00:36:46,608
- I forget.
- No, you don't. Come on.

589
00:36:46,678 --> 00:36:49,579
- [Nesbitt] Is he being modest?
- Yes, he's being very modest.

590
00:36:50,982 --> 00:36:53,416
What do you think
you're doing here?

591
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:56,113
Mrs. Wilson asked me to tell you
that the others have arrived.

592
00:36:56,188 --> 00:36:58,554
[Jennings]
Good.

593
00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:09,824
Lord Rupert Standish
and Mr. Blond are here, milady.

594
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,062
No, they're too late. They can
have a tray in the billiard room.

595
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:14,765
- They can join us later.
- Very good, milady.

596
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:18,332
- Is Rupert here?
Shall I go and say hello?
- [Sylvia] yes.

597
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:21,072
No, I don't think so.

598
00:37:24,816 --> 00:37:26,784
[Blond]
Face it. You're a younger son...

599
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:31,312
with the taste of marquess
and the income of a vicar.

600
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,826
Her mother likes you.
She does too.

601
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:36,952
Now, I know she's not
exactly a show-Stopper...

602
00:37:37,028 --> 00:37:39,826
- Her father's not keen on the idea.
- He'll come around.

603
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:44,335
"Have you met my daughter,
Lady Rupert Standish?"

604
00:37:44,403 --> 00:37:46,530
He thinks I'm in it
for the money.

605
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:49,768
Of course he does.
But you can't let that put you off.

606
00:37:49,841 --> 00:37:52,105
He's much more ofan obstacle
than you think.

607
00:37:52,177 --> 00:37:55,544
Then you must overcome that,
mustn't you?

608
00:37:55,614 --> 00:37:59,380
Her Ladyship asked if you would
join her in the drawing room
when you've finished.

609
00:37:59,451 --> 00:38:01,385
[McCordle]
All right, ladies, off you go.

610
00:38:01,453 --> 00:38:03,387
[Chattering]

611
00:38:03,455 --> 00:38:05,355
Gentlemen.

612
00:38:05,424 --> 00:38:07,415
Gents, move down.
Move down.

613
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:10,290
Louisa, look after Pip
for me, will you?

614
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:13,763
I wonder if we could have
a word or two later on, William?

615
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:16,528
Do you think so?

616
00:38:16,601 --> 00:38:18,967
Ah, good, good.

617
00:38:19,037 --> 00:38:21,369
- Jennings, could l...
- Certainly, sir.

618
00:38:23,809 --> 00:38:26,539
[Bertha] There's more in here.
I'm just getting them.

619
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,806
I need all the knives there.
All the knives.

620
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,246
Come on, Maude.
Let's go and get the fish kettle.

621
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:39,049
Fred? Albert?
Ready?

622
00:38:41,126 --> 00:38:43,060
- There he is.
- Who?

623
00:38:43,128 --> 00:38:47,360
Lord Stockbridge's valet.
Apparently, he grew up in an orphanage.

624
00:38:47,432 --> 00:38:49,923
Arthur said they made him
shout it down the table.

625
00:38:50,001 --> 00:38:51,935
Makes you feel
sorry for him, really.

626
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:53,937
[Mrs. Croft] It's nothing to be
ashamed of. It's not his fault.

627
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:57,998
Would you like me to ask Lord Rupert
and Mr. Blond to join you, sir?

628
00:38:58,076 --> 00:39:00,408
No, leave them be.
They can entertain the ladies.

629
00:39:00,479 --> 00:39:02,413
Give Mr. Novello a rest.

630
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:04,813
Anthony, did I overhear you
at dinner saying...

631
00:39:04,883 --> 00:39:07,147
- you were going into business
with Sir William?
- I beg your pardon?

632
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,187
- Is it very old?
- Possibly, possibly.

633
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:12,382
Lf you need an expert
in changing money,

634
00:39:12,457 --> 00:39:14,721
Especially Africa,
I'm your man... expert.

635
00:39:14,793 --> 00:39:16,761
Yes, the expert.

636
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:20,059
No, it's not here.

637
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:22,065
And Mr. Jennings is certain
he hasn't got it?

638
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,067
Oh, so he says.

639
00:39:24,135 --> 00:39:26,695
But if it's a silver carving knife,
he must have it.

640
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:29,296
It's just gone in the wrong drawer
in the silver pantry.

641
00:39:29,374 --> 00:39:32,138
- It wouldn't have been put in here.
- Well, that's what I told him.

642
00:39:33,945 --> 00:39:37,472
How old would you say
that Mr. Stockbridge was?

643
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:42,009
Don't know.
About 31, 32.

644
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:44,385
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

645
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:47,391
I think I'll turn in.
We got an early start.

646
00:39:47,459 --> 00:39:50,053
You can tell Mr. Jennings
we haven't got that knife.

647
00:40:00,705 --> 00:40:03,037
Pleasant evening, milady?

648
00:40:03,108 --> 00:40:05,042
Not really, no.

649
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,511
Had Lord Stockbridge on one side
boring for Britain,

650
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,811
And Freddie Nesbitt
on the other sucking up.

651
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:16,619
Oh, I'm worn out.
Is there any more chocolate in that pot?

652
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:20,722
I'll go down and
make some more, milady.

653
00:40:23,528 --> 00:40:25,462
[Thunder Rumbling]

654
00:40:27,999 --> 00:40:30,524
[Door Opens, Closes]

655
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,939
Lewis?

656
00:40:39,711 --> 00:40:42,475
Lewis?

657
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:45,038
I was looking
for my maid.

658
00:40:45,116 --> 00:40:47,050
She's just gone downstairs.

659
00:40:47,118 --> 00:40:49,678
Can I help?

660
00:40:49,754 --> 00:40:53,952
She's going to fetch me some chocolate,
but now I wonder whether
I wouldn't prefer milk.

661
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:56,550
Would that be hot milk
or cold?

662
00:40:56,628 --> 00:40:59,290
You decide.

663
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:02,128
I couldn't say, milady.

664
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,566
Hot then, with something
to make it sweet.

665
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:07,503
You have your hands
in your pockets.

666
00:41:07,572 --> 00:41:11,064
- Otherwise, I'll never sleep.
- Why?

667
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,372
Do you have trouble sleeping,
milady?

668
00:41:13,445 --> 00:41:16,778
I have a feeling
I might have trouble tonight.

669
00:41:16,848 --> 00:41:21,581
I'll be wide awake at 1:00 a.M.,
bored to sobs.

670
00:41:22,921 --> 00:41:25,856
Then we must try and think
of something to amuse you.

671
00:41:38,703 --> 00:41:42,400
- Barnes. It's all right.
- Oh, I'm so sorry, sir.

672
00:41:42,474 --> 00:41:44,408
No, I knew it. I knew William
would try something like this.

673
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:46,410
- Well, of course he would. Fuck him!
- [Door Slams Shut]

674
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:49,709
- Short arse.
- And fuck this room!

675
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,820
I think you should
come with me tomorrow.

676
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,823
I'll just say
I need you.

677
00:42:02,093 --> 00:42:04,027
Oh, I got through
to the coast tonight.

678
00:42:04,095 --> 00:42:06,325
Finally.
Is that clock right?

679
00:42:09,467 --> 00:42:11,935
We got turned down
by Una Merkel,

680
00:42:12,003 --> 00:42:15,461
So... sheehan's
pushing for a rewrite.

681
00:42:17,308 --> 00:42:19,242
He thinks the part's
too small.

682
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:26,611
It's a fucking Charlie Chan picture,
not a movie about a socialite.

683
00:42:28,453 --> 00:42:31,479
So...
[Clears Throat]

684
00:42:31,556 --> 00:42:33,490
Will I see you later?

685
00:42:35,226 --> 00:42:38,161
I don't think I should risk it.
Do you?

686
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:42,933
Good night, sir.

687
00:42:43,001 --> 00:42:45,265
- [Door Opens]
- Henry.

688
00:42:47,305 --> 00:42:50,240
Don't forget those.
They'll think you don't care.

689
00:43:33,051 --> 00:43:35,952
Oh. I must've taken
the wrong stairs.

690
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,954
You better not
be seen up here.

691
00:43:42,861 --> 00:43:45,386
- I'd better go down.
- Why?

692
00:43:45,463 --> 00:43:47,397
There's no rush.

693
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:52,061
Since you're here now,
what about a drink?

694
00:43:55,974 --> 00:43:58,340
[Gasps]
what are you doing?

695
00:43:58,409 --> 00:44:02,175
[Grunting]
No!

696
00:44:02,247 --> 00:44:06,081
Get off me!
[Yelling]

697
00:44:06,151 --> 00:44:09,245
Get off me!
Get off...

698
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:11,550
what?

699
00:44:12,824 --> 00:44:16,191
What's this?
What are you doing here?

700
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:19,628
I came up the wrong staircase. I was
just waiting till the coast was clear.

701
00:44:21,432 --> 00:44:23,900
Well, you better go down again
before anyone catches you.

702
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:25,902
Just a minute.

703
00:44:38,883 --> 00:44:41,351
- What?
- Nothing.

704
00:44:45,924 --> 00:44:48,290
- Do you want a drink?
- Sure.

705
00:44:50,595 --> 00:44:53,393
So what do you make
of the place?

706
00:44:53,464 --> 00:44:56,262
Is this a well-Run house,
would you say?

707
00:44:56,334 --> 00:44:58,802
Do you think Sir William
would be good to work for?

708
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,304
No.

709
00:45:01,372 --> 00:45:03,533
How long you been
doing this?

710
00:45:03,608 --> 00:45:05,769
- What?
- Valeting?

711
00:45:05,844 --> 00:45:10,577
About seven years.
I was a footman before that.

712
00:45:10,648 --> 00:45:13,640
And working for Lord Stockbridge...
is that a promotion?

713
00:45:13,718 --> 00:45:15,652
No.

714
00:45:18,523 --> 00:45:20,457
I used to be with
the Earl of Flintshire.

715
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:23,627
Then why did you move?

716
00:45:23,695 --> 00:45:25,629
'Cause I felt like it.

717
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:29,530
Who's that?

718
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:32,092
- That's my mother.
- Where's she live?

719
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,434
She doesn't. That's why
they put me in an orphanage.

720
00:45:35,707 --> 00:45:39,165
That's right. Sorry.

721
00:45:39,244 --> 00:45:41,178
What happened to her?

722
00:45:42,547 --> 00:45:44,481
What do you mean?

723
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:47,677
I mean, why did she die?
Was she young?

724
00:45:47,752 --> 00:45:50,585
Was it in childbirth?

725
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:53,055
You're not very curious,
are you?

726
00:45:56,261 --> 00:45:59,196
Yeah, she was young.
She worked in a factory.

727
00:45:59,264 --> 00:46:01,357
She had me.
A little while later, she died.

728
00:46:01,432 --> 00:46:03,832
End of story.

729
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:06,496
Then why didn't you say
she was a factory worker at dinner?

730
00:46:06,571 --> 00:46:10,632
'Cause I didn't fancy discussing
my private life
with a table full of strangers.

731
00:46:12,777 --> 00:46:15,211
I'm sorry if I spoke
out of turn, mate.

732
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,214
Didn't mean to offend you.

733
00:46:17,282 --> 00:46:19,341
I'm not offended.

734
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,351
And don't call me "mate."

735
00:46:23,454 --> 00:46:27,390
Well, I'll see you later.

736
00:46:27,458 --> 00:46:29,892
I've got a date
with a hot glass of milk.

[Door Opens, Closes]

738
00:46:32,797 --> 00:46:37,200
[Elsie] I shouldn't worry about it.
It goes with the territory.

739
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:42,135
Oh, look.
It's Mr. Novello.

740
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:50,009
Just think of him
sleeping downstairs.

741
00:46:50,081 --> 00:46:53,539
I'm gonna have to watch you, my girl.
I can see that.

742
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:56,746
Her Ladyship says Mr. Weissman's
a Hollywood producer.

743
00:46:56,821 --> 00:46:58,755
He does
the Charlie Chan films.

744
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:01,553
Yeah, I like those. I like
a bit of a fright in the cinema.

745
00:47:01,626 --> 00:47:04,288
You could go with his valet.
He'd give you a fright.

746
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:10,627
You'd better keep your eye on him.
I think he's a queer one.

747
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:13,364
He's not from Scotland,
for a start.

748
00:47:13,438 --> 00:47:15,804
At least not any part of it
that I know.

749
00:47:19,744 --> 00:47:23,111
- What's Mrs. Nesbitt like?
- She's all right.

750
00:47:23,181 --> 00:47:25,581
I feel a bit sorry
for her, really.

751
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:28,414
- Of course, it never works.
- What never works?

752
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:30,545
Well, when a man like that
marries beneath him,

753
00:47:30,621 --> 00:47:33,112
He hasn't got the brains
to carry it off.

754
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:35,989
I think it's romantic
to marry for love.

755
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,460
Love? Not him.

756
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:40,554
He's a nasty piece
of work.

757
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:43,600
The Honorable
Freddie Nesbitt.

758
00:47:43,668 --> 00:47:45,602
That's a laugh.

759
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,763
No, it was her father's money
he was after.

760
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:50,501
It was less than he thought,
and now it's all spent,

761
00:47:50,575 --> 00:47:54,136
All he's got to show for it
is a wife he's ashamed of.

762
00:47:54,212 --> 00:47:56,442
And he's lost his job.

with Sir William.

Do you think
I could do it now?

768
00:48:08,793 --> 00:48:12,058
- Do you want me to go with you?
- No.

769
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:15,065
I'll be all right.

770
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:50,767
What are you doing
down here?

771
00:48:50,835 --> 00:48:54,601
I'm supposed to wash
Lady Trentham's shirt for tomorrow.

What are you doing here?

777
00:50:23,294 --> 00:50:25,819
I just had to rinse
this shirt out.

778
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,544
Should've knocked,
shouldn't you?

779
00:50:55,626 --> 00:50:57,560
Miss Trentham?

780
00:50:57,628 --> 00:51:00,426
I was just washing a shirt
of Her Ladyship's.

781
00:51:00,498 --> 00:51:03,592
I hope you found everything
you required.

782
00:51:03,668 --> 00:51:06,466
Does she have to have
marmalade?

783
00:51:06,537 --> 00:51:10,564
Only Dorothy made
too little of it last January,
and we've run out of the homemade.

784
00:51:10,641 --> 00:51:13,735
I don't suppose she'd care
for strawberry jam instead?

00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:18,414
- No, I thought not.
- [Footsteps]

Oh, I was rather hoping for
a word with Mrs. Wilson.

Mrs. Wilson,
will you tell Jennings...

788
00:51:28,326 --> 00:51:30,954
that we'll have the soup
after the fourth drive tomorrow.

789
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:34,520
And-And tell Mrs. Croft
to make sure it's hot.

790
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:37,966
It's been cold the last few weeks.
And more pepper in it.

[Sylvia]
Is that you?

792
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:56,386

[Man #2]
well, lads, don't coach your guns,

796
00:52:10,034 --> 00:52:11,968
Even if they can't hit
a barn door.

797
00:52:12,036 --> 00:52:16,666
- Don't tell them where
they're missing unless they ask.
- [McCordle] Lovely day.

- Jennings.
- I hope it holds for you, sir.

799
00:52:20,378 --> 00:52:23,279
- Enjoy the shoot.
- Can a pheasant ever be dangerous?

800
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:25,907
- Dangerous?
- Do I have to worry about it attacking?

801
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,679
- Good morning, sir.
- Right, draw your pegs.

- Morning, Jennings.
- Are you shooting today, sir?

805
00:52:35,993 --> 00:52:37,927
- I never shoot.
- Oh.

806
00:52:37,995 --> 00:52:41,624
You see,
I'm-I'm starving.

807
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:44,497
Where have you been?

808
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:46,502
Sorry.

a good breakfast here.

I'll say that for Sylvia.

811

She's not at all mean
in that way.

Oh, dear.

00:53:00,851 --> 00:53:03,251
Well, I suppose
one can't have everything.

815
00:53:03,321 --> 00:53:06,154
Mary, I don't think
I'll wear that shirt after all.

816
00:53:06,223 --> 00:53:08,691
The other one's warmer.
That's all I care about.

817
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:13,123
Ooh, yum my.

818
00:53:13,197 --> 00:53:15,131
Yum my, yum my, yum my.

819
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,866
What do you mean,
you're going shooting?

820
00:53:18,936 --> 00:53:22,838
Mr. Weissman wants me to accompany him.
Nothing wrong in that.

821
00:53:22,907 --> 00:53:26,206
But what for? You're not loading.
He hasn't got a gun.

822
00:53:26,277 --> 00:53:30,077
- He might need something.
- What could he need?

823
00:53:30,147 --> 00:53:35,141
Yeah, we know the very idea of service
is offensive to you, George.

824
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:37,881
But there's no need
to take it out on the rest of us.

825
00:53:37,955 --> 00:53:40,617
Please forgive our ill manners,
Mr. Weissman.

826
00:53:44,862 --> 00:53:47,763
I think he's got
something to hide, that one.

827
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:52,132
We all have something to hide,
Mr. Meredith.

828
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,117
Would you like to
get changed now, miss?

829
00:54:16,227 --> 00:54:19,287
- He won't do it.
- Who won't do what?

830
00:54:19,363 --> 00:54:23,197
My father.
He won't give Freddie a job.

831
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:26,065
I spoke to him last night,
and he said he'd think about it.

832
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,766
But this morning, he says it isn't
up to him, when, of course, it is.

833
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,206
- Why not?
- I don't know.

834
00:54:32,276 --> 00:54:34,767
Something to do with
why Freddie was sacked.

835
00:54:34,845 --> 00:54:37,609
But I can't get a straight answer
out of either of them.

836
00:54:37,681 --> 00:54:42,015
Well, you've done your best.
Mr. Nesbitt can't ask
for more than that now, can he?

837
00:54:42,086 --> 00:54:44,077
But he can, much more!

838
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,089
He says he's going
to tell him.

839
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,388
- [Opening Drawer]
- Do you think he will?

840
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,453
I don't know. He says Daddy
will give him a job to keep him quiet.

841
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:58,868
Will you say something?

842
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:00,870
To Mr. Nesbitt?

843
00:55:02,773 --> 00:55:04,707
To Daddy.

844
00:55:07,611 --> 00:55:10,671
Really, miss, why do you think
I can make a difference?

845
00:55:11,882 --> 00:55:14,715
Will you?

846
00:55:14,785 --> 00:55:17,515
I think you should wear
your warm underwear today.

847
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:22,492
[Horn sounding]

848
00:55:31,168 --> 00:55:33,762
[Gunshots]

849
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:46,416
Nearly.

850
00:55:51,956 --> 00:55:54,891
- [Gunshots Continue]
- That's mine.

851
00:55:57,094 --> 00:55:59,562
Oh, God!
It's on its way.

852
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:02,793
- [Barking]
- [Whistling]

853
00:56:05,970 --> 00:56:08,598
Damn!
Bloody gun's no good.

854
00:56:08,672 --> 00:56:12,130
[McCordle]
I told you not to bring this one.

855
00:56:12,209 --> 00:56:14,507
[Gunshot]

856
00:56:16,547 --> 00:56:18,481
[Gunshot]

857
00:56:21,418 --> 00:56:24,683
- [Gunshots Continue]
- [McCordle] Blast.

858
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:28,191
I think I pricked that one.
I -I'm pretty sure I pricked it.

859
00:56:29,827 --> 00:56:32,091
[McCordle]
Bugger!

860
00:56:35,032 --> 00:56:36,863
Ohh! Oh!

861
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:40,369
Blast it!

862
00:56:46,043 --> 00:56:48,170
- [Gunshot]
- Oh, damn!

863
00:56:48,245 --> 00:56:50,338
- [Man]Are you all right, sir?
- No, I'm not!

864
00:56:50,414 --> 00:56:53,349
God, where the bloody hell
did that come from?

865
00:56:53,417 --> 00:56:56,818
- It's nicked you, sir.
- [Groans] It's nicked me.

866
00:56:56,887 --> 00:56:58,980
- What cretin did that?
- I don't know, sir.

867
00:56:59,056 --> 00:57:02,617
Find Strutt. Ask him
if he knows who's responsible.

868
00:57:02,693 --> 00:57:06,322
And if he knows, tell him to send
the gun back to the bloody house.

869
00:57:06,397 --> 00:57:09,855
Everybody knows the desperate situation
we're in, but nobody seems to care.

870
00:57:09,934 --> 00:57:12,368
Oh, there you are.
Did you find one?

871
00:57:12,436 --> 00:57:14,370
- Well?
- Don't look at me.

872
00:57:14,438 --> 00:57:18,340
If I so much as open my mouth on
the subject, it'll make things worse.

873
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:22,573
- I've already tried.
- Jennings says the car's ready.

874
00:57:22,646 --> 00:57:25,171
Oh, goody. I'm starving.
I do love...

875
00:57:25,249 --> 00:57:28,377
- what are you wearing?
- Why? Don't you like it?

876
00:57:30,154 --> 00:57:33,282
- You bought it.
- Did I?

877
00:57:33,357 --> 00:57:35,723
Oh, how extraordinary
of me.

878
00:57:35,793 --> 00:57:38,227
Come on.
Better get going.

879
00:57:38,295 --> 00:57:41,230
- Where's that wretched Mabel?
- [Constance]
Has anyone checked her outfit?

880
00:57:41,298 --> 00:57:44,233
She's probably in black velvet
with a feather in her hair.

881
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:47,236
[Lavinia] she's in the morning room
looking perfectly normal.

882
00:57:47,304 --> 00:57:49,738
- Don't be such a snob, Aunt Constance.
- Me?

883
00:57:49,807 --> 00:57:52,241
I haven't a snobbish bone
in my body.

884
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,184
Oh, Mr. Meredith.

885
00:58:02,252 --> 00:58:05,016
- Is Mr. Stockbridge in?
- Search me.

886
00:58:10,995 --> 00:58:12,929
Oh.
Mr. Stockbridge.

887
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:14,931
I'm sorry to disturb you.

888
00:58:14,999 --> 00:58:17,229
I was just making
my routine inspection.

889
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,307
So, uh, how are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

890
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,645
I'm sorry?

891
00:58:30,914 --> 00:58:33,382
How are you settling in
with Lord Stockbridge?

892
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,886
I know that you haven't
been with him for long.

893
00:58:36,954 --> 00:58:39,388
Not long, no.

894
00:58:40,624 --> 00:58:43,218
I'm afraid smoking
isn't allowed up here.

895
00:58:58,142 --> 00:59:01,908
I hope you're finding everything to make
His Lordship's stay more comfortable.

896
00:59:01,979 --> 00:59:04,311
I hope we haven't
forgotten anything.

897
00:59:04,381 --> 00:59:08,477
I can't believe you forget much,
Mrs. Wilson.

898
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:10,486
No.

899
00:59:10,554 --> 00:59:12,954
Not much.

900
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:15,457
Well, I'll leave you
to your book.

901
00:59:17,528 --> 00:59:19,462
[Door Closes]

902
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:36,278
[McCordle]
you know... Bang! Whoof!

903
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:39,281
[Stockbridge] you should be more
selective about the people you invite.

904
00:59:39,349 --> 00:59:41,283
Well, I've got
a good appetite.

905
00:59:41,351 --> 00:59:43,342
Yes.

906
00:59:54,131 --> 00:59:56,691
[Women Conversing]

907
00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:01,504
[Weissman] It's very muddy,
so watch where you step.

908
01:00:01,572 --> 01:00:04,006
[Sylvia]
Terribly muddy here. Do watch.

909
01:00:04,074 --> 01:00:07,009
Do you see what I'm saying?
I've been noticing it.

910
01:00:07,077 --> 01:00:10,513
Doesn't this look lovely?
They really have done well.

911
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:13,049
Now do go in
and have a drink.

912
01:00:13,117 --> 01:00:16,678
I can tell you, Raymond, it's
a bloody awful thing to have happened.

913
01:00:16,754 --> 01:00:19,689
- [McCordle] Oh, God, Louisa.
- Oh! Oh, I say.

914
01:00:19,757 --> 01:00:22,692
Two inches to my right I'd have
been dead. I've just been shot.

915
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,523
- What?
- Yes, that's right.

916
01:00:24,595 --> 01:00:26,529
[Constance]
Oh, yes, please.

917
01:00:26,597 --> 01:00:29,862
- What happened to your ear?
- Some idiot shot me.

918
01:00:29,933 --> 01:00:32,868
- I was a terrible shot.
- Did you have fun?

919
01:00:32,936 --> 01:00:36,372
- I don't think you realize
how serious this is.
- [Lavinia] Of course I do.

920
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,874
Why can't you get
your sisters to help?

921
01:00:38,942 --> 01:00:42,173
Darling, do you think I haven't tried?
You know what they're like.

922
01:00:42,246 --> 01:00:45,181
Well, I know they couldn't care less
if we go under.

923
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:49,447
Why should they care,
as long as their dressmakers are busy
and their dinners are on time?

924
01:00:52,523 --> 01:00:55,458
- Wait a minute. There's a queue here.
- Shh. Shh.

925
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,462
Ohh!

926
01:00:59,530 --> 01:01:01,464
Shut the door,
for heaven's sake.

927
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,966
Don't worry.
It's only Lewis and Dorothy.

928
01:01:04,034 --> 01:01:07,470
If any of the men get found up here,
they get sacked on the spot.

929
01:01:07,538 --> 01:01:09,472
Worse luck.

930
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:12,703
So don't tell me,
you're a convent girl.

931
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:15,210
Or is that
Presbyterian modesty?

932
01:01:17,614 --> 01:01:20,048
- Is the water hot?
- Not really.

933
01:01:21,618 --> 01:01:24,883
No, it won't be
till the guns get back.

934
01:01:24,955 --> 01:01:27,890
I'd better
get in yours.

935
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:30,893
Her Ladyship says that Sir William
loves his shooting.

936
01:01:30,961 --> 01:01:34,397
Yeah, he does. Can't hit a barn door,
but he does love it.

937
01:01:34,464 --> 01:01:36,398
It's quite sweet,
really.

938
01:01:37,968 --> 01:01:40,402
- Elsie.
- Yeah?

939
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:42,404
Last night...

940
01:01:43,507 --> 01:01:45,441
what?

941
01:01:45,509 --> 01:01:47,443
No, I shouldn't say.

942
01:01:47,511 --> 01:01:49,445
Yes, you should.
What?

943
01:01:51,448 --> 01:01:53,382
Well,

944
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:55,884
When I went down
to wash that shirt,

945
01:01:55,953 --> 01:01:58,888
I think I saw him
in the ironing room.

946
01:01:58,956 --> 01:02:01,390
[Whispers] He was with
one of the kitchen maids.

947
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,653
- No, that wouldn't have been him.
- I think it was.

948
01:02:03,727 --> 01:02:06,161
He came down the passage
a minute later,

949
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,164
And I don't see how...

950
01:02:08,232 --> 01:02:10,166
No, it wasn't him.

951
01:02:10,234 --> 01:02:12,168
You weren't serious
last night, wereyou?

952
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:14,170
I'm afraid I was,
old boy.

953
01:02:14,238 --> 01:02:17,173
I was going to tell you next week,
but sinceyou mentioned it...

954
01:02:17,241 --> 01:02:20,176
I don't thinkyou've grasped quite
what it'll do to the whole project,

955
01:02:20,244 --> 01:02:22,678
And in particular
what it'll do to me.

956
01:02:22,746 --> 01:02:25,681
- It can't be as black
as all that, can it?
- Yes, it bloodywell is.

957
01:02:25,749 --> 01:02:28,684
I'm sorry to hearthat,
but business is business.

958
01:02:28,752 --> 01:02:31,312
- I'm not a charity commissioner,
you know.
- William, I'm begging you.

959
01:02:31,388 --> 01:02:32,821
[McCordle Gasps]

960
01:02:33,891 --> 01:02:35,552
Damn it!

961
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,560
[Constance]
Oh, dear.

962
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:39,562
- [Jennings] I'll clearthat up.
- I'm sorry.

963
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:42,030
[Jennings]
Arthur, go andget a bucket.

964
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:44,033
- Have you a cloth?
- Under the table.

965
01:02:44,101 --> 01:02:46,035
[Man]
Seems verynervous.

966
01:02:46,103 --> 01:02:48,970
[Jennings] we'll have that
cleaned for you at the house.

967
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:51,974
- I do like gathering nuts in May
- Terrified the life out of me.

968
01:02:52,042 --> 01:02:55,478
- I borrowed it from Lewis.
- Lf you've a dimple
it's very simple

969
01:02:55,545 --> 01:02:58,981
- All you need is a smile
that's sweet and shy
- Shot, frightened to death.

970
01:02:59,049 --> 01:03:01,210
And sort of
a twinkle in your eye

971
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:03,412
Here I come
gathering nuts in May

972
01:03:03,487 --> 01:03:05,978
When I detect 'em
I soon collect 'em

973
01:03:06,056 --> 01:03:09,048
- I think it's left me deaf.
- They stand around me
simply waiting to be picked

974
01:03:09,126 --> 01:03:12,584
You know how you said Sir William
could've had his pick...

975
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,597
between Lady Sylvia
and Lady Stockbridge?

976
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:18,101
- Aye.
- Well, I asked Her Ladyship about it.

977
01:03:18,168 --> 01:03:20,762
She said
they cut cards for him.

978
01:03:22,272 --> 01:03:24,399
- No!
- I know.

979
01:03:24,474 --> 01:03:26,408
I can't believe it
either.

980
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:28,910
Do you suppose
it was a joke?

981
01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:31,914
Well, I wouldn't
be too sure.

982
01:03:31,982 --> 01:03:34,246
You know what I heard?

983
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:36,252
Oh, just listen to me.

984
01:03:36,320 --> 01:03:39,756
- What?
- Why do we spend our lives
living through them?

985
01:03:40,824 --> 01:03:42,758
I mean,
look at poor old Lewis.

986
01:03:42,826 --> 01:03:45,556
Lf her own mother
had a heart attack,

987
01:03:45,629 --> 01:03:48,564
She'd think it was less important
than one of Lady Sylvia's farts.

988
01:03:48,632 --> 01:03:51,692
You must know.
You can't fool me.

989
01:03:51,768 --> 01:03:54,601
Lf there's one thing I don't
look for in a maid, it's discretion.

990
01:03:54,671 --> 01:03:57,105
Except with my own secrets,
of course.

991
01:03:57,174 --> 01:03:59,472
Well, I don't know much,
milady,

992
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:02,808
But apparently he was counting
on Sir William for an investment...

993
01:04:02,879 --> 01:04:06,371
and had guaranteed his interest,
whatever that means.

994
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,816
Anyway, Mr. Barnes,
the commander's valet,

995
01:04:08,885 --> 01:04:11,319
He said he wanted
to leave at once,

996
01:04:11,388 --> 01:04:15,324
But Lady Lavinia's persuaded him
to stay until tomorrow
to make less of a thing of it.

997
01:04:15,392 --> 01:04:17,326
- [Door Opens]
- [Sylvia] Oh, thank heavens.

998
01:04:17,394 --> 01:04:19,658
Lewis told me
you were wearing white.

999
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,665
White? She must be mad.
I never wear white.

1000
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,667
I thought
it was a little odd.

1001
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:28,068
By the way, for God's sake,
don't rub him up tonight.

1002
01:04:28,138 --> 01:04:31,073
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know exactly what I mean.

1003
01:04:31,141 --> 01:04:33,575
He's in a filthy mood
with everyone.

1004
01:04:33,643 --> 01:04:35,736
He's talking about
stopping your allowance.

1005
01:04:37,147 --> 01:04:40,583
But it's for life.
That was settled. He can't do that.

1006
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:44,416
Just you watch him.
He's absolutely spoiling for a fight.

1007
01:04:44,488 --> 01:04:47,423
So if you'll take my advice,
you won't give him one.

1008
01:04:47,491 --> 01:04:49,425
[Door Closes]

1009
01:04:49,493 --> 01:04:51,927
Now, that you can be
discreet about.

1010
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:58,267
Thank you.

1011
01:05:01,004 --> 01:05:03,199
[Lavinia]
Goodness, isn't it pretty here?

1012
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:06,367
The house has
such lovely position.

1013
01:05:06,443 --> 01:05:09,037
The best view's
from the old water tower.

1014
01:05:09,112 --> 01:05:11,546
You might well
walk up there tomorrow.

1015
01:05:12,949 --> 01:05:15,884
Do you really have to
go back to London?

1016
01:05:15,952 --> 01:05:17,886
I am afraid so,
Raymond.

1017
01:05:17,954 --> 01:05:20,821
When you're ruined,
there's so much to do.

1018
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:24,393
Yes, there is,
isn't there?

1019
01:05:24,461 --> 01:05:26,395
Moan, moan, moan.

1020
01:05:26,463 --> 01:05:28,795
[Whispering]

1021
01:05:34,371 --> 01:05:37,807
Would anybody care for
a game of bridge after dinner?

1022
01:05:37,874 --> 01:05:39,808
[Nesbitt]
Oh, yes, I wouldn't mind.

1023
01:05:40,877 --> 01:05:43,641
Who else?
Louisa, how about you?

1024
01:05:43,713 --> 01:05:48,343
Oh, I don't think so.
I've rather gone off cards.

1025
01:05:48,418 --> 01:05:50,648
I've never been very lucky
with them.

1026
01:05:51,721 --> 01:05:53,484
Me too.

1027
01:05:57,561 --> 01:06:01,190
Mr. Weissman, tell us about
the film you're going to make.

1028
01:06:01,264 --> 01:06:04,700
Oh, sure. It's called Charlie Chan
in London. It's a detective story.

1029
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:08,260
- Set in London?
- Well, not really.

1030
01:06:08,338 --> 01:06:11,603
Most of it takes place at
a shooting party in a country house,

1031
01:06:11,675 --> 01:06:14,109
Sort of like this one,
actually.

1032
01:06:14,177 --> 01:06:17,408
A murder in the middle of the night.
A lot of guests for the weekend.

1033
01:06:17,481 --> 01:06:19,915
Everyone's a suspect.
That sort of thing.

1034
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:23,452
How horrid.

1035
01:06:23,520 --> 01:06:25,784
And who turns out
to have done it?

1036
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:29,087
I couldn't tell you that.
It would spoil it for you.

1037
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:32,094
- Oh, but none of us will see it.
- [Gasps, Chuckles]

1038
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:35,762
Are you thinking of
making it here, Mr. Weissman?

1039
01:06:35,832 --> 01:06:40,098
Uh, no, we're going to shoot it
in Hollywood, on the back lot.

1040
01:06:40,170 --> 01:06:44,698
But since I was in England,
I thought I would do
a little research on country living...

1041
01:06:44,774 --> 01:06:49,711
and Ivor was kind enough
to arrange it for me.

1042
01:06:49,779 --> 01:06:52,407
Mm m, no.
William arranged it for you.

1043
01:06:52,482 --> 01:06:56,213
- [Weissman]
Are you interested in films, sir?
- [Scoffs] Not likely.

1044
01:06:56,286 --> 01:06:59,119
Why shouldn't I
be interested in films?

1045
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:01,089
You don't know
what I'm interested in.

1046
01:07:01,158 --> 01:07:04,491
Well, I know you're interested in money
and fiddling with your guns,

1047
01:07:04,561 --> 01:07:06,495
But when it comes to anything else,
I'm stumped.

1048
01:07:06,563 --> 01:07:08,497
That is not fair.
Bill is...

1049
01:07:10,634 --> 01:07:12,568
[Laughs]

1050
01:07:58,348 --> 01:08:00,282
Elsie.

1051
01:08:01,851 --> 01:08:03,785
Elsie, what's...

1052
01:08:07,023 --> 01:08:09,457
It's not as if
I didn't know.

1053
01:08:09,526 --> 01:08:12,723
- [Chuckling]
- So we can all play bridge.

1054
01:08:12,796 --> 01:08:17,733
- All playing?
- Who's going to play bridge?
Are they going to play?

1055
01:08:17,801 --> 01:08:19,894
Where's Rupert?

1056
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,131
- Rupert!
- [Standish] Coming.

1057
01:08:22,205 --> 01:08:24,139
[Whispering]

1058
01:08:24,207 --> 01:08:28,507
- I heard Lady Sylvia spoke out of turn.
- You didn't actually see?

1059
01:08:33,316 --> 01:08:35,750
So what's going to
happen to Elsie?

1060
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:39,915
- She'll be lucky if they don't
boot her out before morning.
- You should've seen it.

1061
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:42,424
[Sarah]
She has been here a long time.

1062
01:08:42,492 --> 01:08:45,655
[Barnes] Shall I tell you
what that means to them? Bugger all.

1063
01:08:45,729 --> 01:08:49,165
Please, Mr. Meredith.
There are ladies present.

1064
01:08:49,232 --> 01:08:51,257
Where, exactly,
is Sir William now?

1065
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:53,825
He's still in the library.
He won't be out again tonight.

1066
01:08:53,903 --> 01:08:56,337
[Lewis Sighs]
oh, Dorothy.

1067
01:08:56,406 --> 01:09:01,070
- Mr. Meredith,
may I ask what is going on?
- Uh, we were just...

1068
01:09:01,144 --> 01:09:04,511
George, will you please join me in
the drawing room as soon as possible.

1069
01:09:04,581 --> 01:09:07,414
- Mr. Probert, kindly
take everybody back downstairs.
- Certainly.

1070
01:09:07,484 --> 01:09:09,418
Dorothy, I'm especially
surprised at you.

1071
01:09:09,486 --> 01:09:12,216
[Probert]
Come along, ladies. Come along.

1072
01:09:14,758 --> 01:09:18,285
Is it true, then?
Has Elsie really been sacked?

1073
01:09:20,864 --> 01:09:23,128
- Lady Trentham.
- Well, luck of the draw.

1074
01:09:24,868 --> 01:09:26,802
- Freddie, I'd like to...
- Darling, we've just cut.

1075
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,735
- [Sylvia] Ivor, darling.
- Thank you.

1076
01:09:28,805 --> 01:09:31,740
Would it be awful of me
to ask you to play something...

1077
01:09:31,808 --> 01:09:33,742
to cheer us all up a bit?

1078
01:09:33,810 --> 01:09:35,744
- Of course not.
- Thank you.

1079
01:09:35,812 --> 01:09:38,542
- So sweet.
- [Weissman]
I've booked the first passage home.

1080
01:09:38,615 --> 01:09:42,051
I'll be living on the phone till I set
sail. I have to be in London tomorrow.

1081
01:09:42,118 --> 01:09:45,053
Lf you prefer to stay,
I can take a train.

1082
01:09:45,121 --> 01:09:48,056
- I'll give you a lift in my car.
- Oh, thank you.

1083
01:09:48,124 --> 01:09:51,059
You're providing a lot
of entertainment for nothing.

1084
01:09:51,127 --> 01:09:53,061
Morris,
I'm used to it.

1085
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:55,723
Excuse me.

1086
01:09:55,799 --> 01:09:59,235
- [Nesbitt] Music moves on.
- [Sylvia] Funny old evening, hmm?

1087
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:03,498
Somewhere
there's another land

1088
01:10:03,573 --> 01:10:05,507
- Oh!
- Different from this one

1089
01:10:05,575 --> 01:10:08,510
You're not going to stand over
my shoulder and watch me, please.

1090
01:10:08,578 --> 01:10:10,671
- Far more mercifully planned
- You'll put me off.

1091
01:10:10,747 --> 01:10:13,910
- [Constance]
He's rather a big success, isn't he?
- Than the cruel Place we know

1092
01:10:13,983 --> 01:10:15,917
[Nesbitt]
Huge. It's absolutely ridiculous.

1093
01:10:15,985 --> 01:10:18,146
Innocence and Peace
are there

1094
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:20,655
Do you think he'll be as long
as he usually is?

1095
01:10:20,724 --> 01:10:23,659
- All is good that is desired
- I think he's rather wonderful.

1096
01:10:23,727 --> 01:10:25,661
- Hmm?
- I think he's rather wonderful.

1097
01:10:25,729 --> 01:10:27,458
Faces there
are always fair

1098
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:31,057
Love grows never old

1099
01:10:31,134 --> 01:10:34,661
- Nor tired
- [Constance]
Well, I have only seen one.

1100
01:10:35,739 --> 01:10:38,674
We shall never find

1101
01:10:38,742 --> 01:10:41,210
That lovely land

1102
01:10:41,277 --> 01:10:44,906
Of Might-Have-Been

1103
01:10:44,981 --> 01:10:48,644
- I shall never be your king
- [Sylvia] I thought
you weren't drinking anymore.

1104
01:10:48,718 --> 01:10:52,984
Nor you
shall be my queen

1105
01:10:53,056 --> 01:10:56,321
Days may pass
and years may pass

1106
01:10:56,393 --> 01:11:01,524
And seas
may lie between

1107
01:11:01,598 --> 01:11:03,998
- We shall never find
- I don't think we should be doing this.

1108
01:11:04,067 --> 01:11:06,092
- That lovely land
- Oh, come on.

1109
01:11:06,169 --> 01:11:08,603
Of Might-Have-Been

1110
01:11:10,673 --> 01:11:14,302
Sometimes
on the rarest nights

1111
01:11:14,377 --> 01:11:15,901
Comes the vision

1112
01:11:15,979 --> 01:11:18,243
- Calm and clear
- I don't know. It's just...

1113
01:11:18,314 --> 01:11:21,044
- [Continues]
- I mean, how could she
let him touch her?

1114
01:11:21,117 --> 01:11:24,712
- You sound as if you don't like him.
- You'd be surprised.

1115
01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:26,983
- All right, surprise me.
- Maybe I will.

1116
01:11:27,056 --> 01:11:29,786
Winds from that far land
are blown

1117
01:11:29,859 --> 01:11:31,486
I saw him in The Lodger.

1118
01:11:31,561 --> 01:11:34,826
- Whispering with secret breath
- But I've never heard him sing.

1119
01:11:34,898 --> 01:11:39,631
Hope that Plays
her tune alone

1120
01:11:39,702 --> 01:11:43,069
Love that conquers Pain

1121
01:11:43,139 --> 01:11:46,108
And death

1122
01:11:46,176 --> 01:11:49,976
- Will you, um, excuse me for a minute?
- Shall we ever find

1123
01:11:50,046 --> 01:11:51,980
- You don't need my help?
- No, we're fine.

1124
01:11:52,048 --> 01:11:55,347
That lovely land
of Might-Have-Been

1125
01:11:56,586 --> 01:12:00,283
Shall I ever be
your king

1126
01:12:00,356 --> 01:12:03,120
- Or you at last my queen
- Oh, my Lord.

1127
01:12:04,427 --> 01:12:07,487
Days may pass
oryears may pass

1128
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:10,863
The seas
may lie between

1129
01:12:12,268 --> 01:12:15,394
Shall we ever find

1130
01:12:15,472 --> 01:12:17,770
Our lovely land

1131
01:12:17,841 --> 01:12:21,106
- It seems to be much more
than just background music,
- Of Might-Have-Been

1132
01:12:21,177 --> 01:12:23,111
- Somehow or other.
- [Smattering of applause]

1133
01:12:23,179 --> 01:12:25,113
[Sylvia]
Ivor, darling, it was lovely.

1134
01:12:25,181 --> 01:12:27,809
[Sylvia Giggles]

1135
01:12:28,985 --> 01:12:30,919
- [Sylvia] Thank you.

I seem to be the victim

1137
01:12:33,923 --> 01:12:36,414
Of a cruel jest

1138
01:12:36,493 --> 01:12:40,987

She simply
can't take a snub

1157

I go and sulk about

1158
01:13:30,346 --> 01:13:32,644
And take a bath
at the club

01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:16,075
[Screaming Continues]

1305
01:21:16,145 --> 01:21:18,079
[Sylvia]
Louisa!

1306
01:21:18,147 --> 01:21:22,345
- Isobel? Isobel?
- [Louisa Sobbing]

1307
01:21:22,418 --> 01:21:25,319
[Jennings]
George. Excuse me, sir.

1308
01:21:30,159 --> 01:21:32,093
Jennings.

1309
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:41,632
- [Gasps]
- Oh, my dear.

1310
01:21:41,704 --> 01:21:45,504
[All Murmuring]

1311
01:21:45,574 --> 01:21:49,135
Darling? Darling?
Could you ask Jennings about the salts?

1312
01:21:50,479 --> 01:21:52,606
Could somebody get
a glass of water, Please?

1313
01:21:52,681 --> 01:21:55,616
- Keep everybody out of this room.
- Yes, sir, certainly.

1314
01:21:55,684 --> 01:21:58,619
- Over here. Louisa.
- Bill.

1315
01:21:58,687 --> 01:22:02,282
- Louisa, just sit and be quiet.
- But...

1316
01:22:02,358 --> 01:22:04,292
Mummy?
Mummy?

1317
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,794
- Is she all right?
- Everything's fine.

1318
01:22:06,862 --> 01:22:08,796
Sylvia.

1319
01:22:11,767 --> 01:22:15,203
- Well, tell Mr. Warner...
- Excuse me. I need that telephone.

1320
01:22:15,271 --> 01:22:17,205
Excuse me.
I'm on the telephone.

1321
01:22:17,273 --> 01:22:20,208
I'm on a call
to California.

1322
01:22:20,276 --> 01:22:24,440
[Stockbridge] Hello? Yes, would you
connect me with the police station?

1323
01:22:40,629 --> 01:22:44,065
[Weissman] I'm looking for a kind
of realistic Charlie Chan movie.

1324
01:22:44,133 --> 01:22:47,068
This isn't out of the question.
We should try to do this.

1325
01:22:47,136 --> 01:22:51,095
It has to be better. We can't do
the same old shit over and over again.

1326
01:22:51,173 --> 01:22:54,108
Alan Mowbray... I like that.
I mean, that's a butler.

1327
01:22:54,176 --> 01:22:56,406
These people here
look like Alan Mowbray.

1328
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:59,937
I mean, they're sort of tall,
and they don't say too much.

1329
01:23:00,015 --> 01:23:02,950
And they have fucking
British accents, right?

1330
01:23:03,018 --> 01:23:04,952
They talk
like they're from England.

1331
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,454
- Good evening.
We've been expecting you.
- Is Ray Milland British?

1332
01:23:07,523 --> 01:23:10,458
- Yes, good evening.
This is Constable Dexter...
- You must be the police.

1333
01:23:10,526 --> 01:23:13,461
- Yes. How do you do, ma'am?
I'm Inspector Thom...
- I'm Lady Sylvia McCordle.

1334
01:23:13,529 --> 01:23:16,464
We haven't moved him. I've gathered
everyone. Come straight through.

1335
01:23:16,532 --> 01:23:18,466
- [Weissman Continues]
- Certainly, ma'am, yes.

1336
01:23:18,534 --> 01:23:21,469
Oh, don't worry about him.
He's just an American staying with us.

1337
01:23:21,537 --> 01:23:26,406
I'll tell you who we all are.
Then we can all go to bed
and leave you with poor William.

1338
01:23:26,475 --> 01:23:29,410
Yes, indeed. Shall I introduce myself?
I'm Inspector Thom...

1339
01:23:29,478 --> 01:23:31,742
- This is my aunt, Lady Trentham.
- Ah, yes, the Countess of Trentham.

1340
01:23:31,814 --> 01:23:34,009
I served with your husband on a...

1341
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:37,018
My brother-In-Law Lord Stockbridge.
Lady Stockbridge.

1342
01:23:37,086 --> 01:23:40,522
- Jennings, Please,
would you remove that vile animal?
- Certainly, milady.

1343
01:23:40,589 --> 01:23:43,524
Uh, Mrs. Nesbitt.
Mr. Nesbitt.

1344
01:23:43,592 --> 01:23:46,925
- Ivor Novello, who I'm sure
needs no introduction.
- Of course. Mr. Novello, a...

1345
01:23:46,996 --> 01:23:50,397
No, wait. Would you like to speak
to the servants tonight, Inspector?

1346
01:23:50,466 --> 01:23:52,900
- Inspector Thom...
- He ought to speak to Probert,
my husband's valet.

1347
01:23:52,968 --> 01:23:55,334
Tell him to come up.
Now, where was I?

1348
01:23:55,404 --> 01:23:57,838
- Isobel McCordle, my daughter.
- Charlie Chan is in London.

1349
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,841
He's not in California.

1350
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:03,345
They're talking to me about rewrites
about the Part of the Cockney maid,

1351
01:24:03,412 --> 01:24:06,347
And she's running in
and saying all these things.

1352
01:24:06,415 --> 01:24:08,349
Look, I'm here.
They don't talk.

1353
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:11,250
The butlers and maids,
they stand, they watch.

1354
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:13,254
They serve.
They do things.

1355
01:24:13,322 --> 01:24:17,258
What about Claudette Colbert? She's
British, isn't she? She sounds British.

1356
01:24:17,326 --> 01:24:19,851
Is she, like, affected,
or is she British?

1357
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:23,865
[People Chattering]

1358
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:28,870
Oh, Dorothy,
would you take...

1359
01:24:30,739 --> 01:24:34,140
[Coughs, Clears Throat]
Um, well, l...

1360
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,144
Go on, spit it out.

1361
01:24:36,212 --> 01:24:39,147
- The police would like
to see you for a moment.
- Me?

1362
01:24:39,215 --> 01:24:41,911
No, Mrs. Croft.
Mr. Probert.

1363
01:24:41,984 --> 01:24:43,918
Me?

1364
01:24:43,986 --> 01:24:46,250
Why?

1365
01:24:46,322 --> 01:24:48,256
Oh, well,

1366
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,758
L-I don't know
what I can tell them.

1367
01:24:53,128 --> 01:24:56,564
George, would you go and see
if anything more is required
in the red drawing room?

1368
01:24:56,632 --> 01:24:58,964
[George]
yes, sir.

1369
01:24:59,034 --> 01:25:01,969
[Jennings] I don't see the point
in the rest of you waiting up.

1370
01:25:02,037 --> 01:25:03,971
What about me,
Mr. Jennings?

1371
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:06,837
You can go as soon as
the police release you.

1372
01:25:06,909 --> 01:25:08,843
That'll be sometime
tomorrow.

1373
01:25:10,212 --> 01:25:12,646
Until then,
you can stay in your room.

1374
01:25:12,715 --> 01:25:14,649
I'm not contagious,
you know.

1375
01:25:14,717 --> 01:25:16,651
[Jennings]
Nobody's going anywhere.

1376
01:25:17,853 --> 01:25:19,684
Those of you
with remaining duties,

1377
01:25:19,755 --> 01:25:21,689
See to them
as quickly as you can.

1378
01:25:21,757 --> 01:25:24,920
Otherwise...
good night, everyone.

1379
01:25:24,994 --> 01:25:27,428
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

1380
01:25:28,764 --> 01:25:30,698
- Mr. Jennings.
- Yes, Mr. Weissman?

1381
01:25:30,766 --> 01:25:32,700
I have a confession
to make.

1382
01:25:38,641 --> 01:25:42,099
[Weissman] Right, but I think
it's clear it's the valet who did it.

1383
01:25:43,512 --> 01:25:46,447
No, because the valet
has access to everybody.

1384
01:25:46,515 --> 01:25:48,449
No, the valet
isn't the butler.

1385
01:25:48,517 --> 01:25:52,544
No, there's one butler, and there's lots
of valets running all over the Place.

1386
01:25:52,621 --> 01:25:55,556
He takes care of people.
He's in their rooms at night.

1387
01:25:55,624 --> 01:25:58,593
He could do it. I mean,
the valet easily could have done it.

1388
01:25:58,661 --> 01:26:01,095
[Probert Sobbing]

1389
01:26:02,431 --> 01:26:04,865
Pull yourself together,
Mr. Probert.

1390
01:26:04,933 --> 01:26:07,959
Try and be a bit patient.
They'll be along in a minute.

1391
01:26:08,037 --> 01:26:12,736
[Continues Sobbing] Couldn't I just
make him a little more comfortable, sir?

1392
01:26:12,808 --> 01:26:15,106
- Please?
- Have a heart, Inspector.

1393
01:26:15,177 --> 01:26:18,635
No, it wouldn't be wise, sir.
We shouldn't have to wait
too much longer now.

1394
01:26:18,714 --> 01:26:21,046
Oh, I don't think
it'd do any harm.

1395
01:26:25,154 --> 01:26:27,384
Ohh!

1396
01:26:27,456 --> 01:26:31,324
Well, you see, this is why we have
rules and regulations, isn't it?

1397
01:26:31,393 --> 01:26:33,327
What is it, Dexter?

1398
01:26:33,395 --> 01:26:36,330
Well, only that there doesn't seem
to be much blood, sir.

1399
01:26:36,398 --> 01:26:37,922
[Whimpers]

1400
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,434
[Sobbing]

1401
01:26:43,305 --> 01:26:45,739
- Is that everything, mi lord?
- Yes, thank you, Parks.

1402
01:26:45,808 --> 01:26:49,244
- I think perhaps
you should try and get some sleep.
- [Sobbing] It's so unfair!

1403
01:26:49,311 --> 01:26:52,303
[Continues Sobbing]
Nobody liked him.

1404
01:26:57,519 --> 01:26:59,453
- It's terrible.
- [Stockbridge] oh, do stop sniveling.

1405
01:26:59,521 --> 01:27:01,455
Anyone would think
you were Italian.

1406
01:27:01,523 --> 01:27:03,457
[Sobbing Intensifies]

1407
01:27:04,593 --> 01:27:06,527
[Mutters]
Christ.

1408
01:27:12,401 --> 01:27:15,336
Will you not let me help you
with your frock, milady?

1409
01:27:15,404 --> 01:27:17,338
No, I can manage.

1410
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:19,806
- Then I'll say good night, milady.
- Wait, wait.

1411
01:27:23,178 --> 01:27:25,112
Thank you, milady.

1412
01:27:28,517 --> 01:27:31,452
- [Door opens]
- [Sighs]

1413
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:33,454
[Door Closes]

1414
01:27:44,867 --> 01:27:46,892
- [Knock on Door]
- [Door opens]

1415
01:27:46,969 --> 01:27:48,903
What is it?

1416
01:27:58,881 --> 01:28:01,975
Please tell me you haven't
come with condolences.

1417
01:28:02,050 --> 01:28:03,813
[Without Scottish Accent]
No.

1418
01:28:03,886 --> 01:28:06,377
- I was just wondering
if you wanted some com...
- What?

1419
01:28:06,455 --> 01:28:11,654
[With Accent] I said, I was just
wondering if you wanted some company.

1420
01:28:17,399 --> 01:28:20,061
Well, I suppose
life must go on.

1421
01:28:20,135 --> 01:28:22,069
Unhook me.

1422
01:28:30,646 --> 01:28:34,707
No, there's another one.
You'll never get it off like that.

1423
01:28:38,587 --> 01:28:42,023
[Mary]
I'm really sorry about everything.

1424
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:44,024
Don't feel sorry for me.

1425
01:28:44,092 --> 01:28:46,026
Pity that Poor Dorothy.

1426
01:28:46,094 --> 01:28:49,029
She's got all
the early morning teas to do,

1427
01:28:49,097 --> 01:28:51,031
And the breakfast trays.

1428
01:28:51,099 --> 01:28:56,036
And she's got to get Miss Isobel
to the dining room and see
if she can find anything in black.

1429
01:28:57,739 --> 01:29:01,436
She's the one who needs your sympathy.
I'm well out of it.

1430
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:06,281
I would think Miss Isobel
might stay in bed tomorrow.

1431
01:29:07,816 --> 01:29:11,343
Unmarried girls don't have breakfast
trays. Not in this house.

1432
01:29:14,957 --> 01:29:16,891
I wish I could help.

1433
01:29:18,827 --> 01:29:20,761
You can't.

1434
01:29:36,645 --> 01:29:39,580
[Bertha]
George says Mr. Novello was in on it.

1435
01:29:39,648 --> 01:29:42,139
- And Sir William.
- [Woman Gasps]

1436
01:29:42,217 --> 01:29:45,152
The point is, that Henry Denton,
he's an actor.

1437
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:47,154
An actor?

1438
01:29:47,222 --> 01:29:50,658
He's playing a butler
in the next Charlie Chan.
Wanted to make it authentic.

1439
01:29:50,726 --> 01:29:53,661
[Mrs. Croft]
I'd say the joke was on Lady Sylvia.

1440
01:29:53,729 --> 01:29:56,163
I hope he don't model
his performance on Mr. Jennings,

1441
01:29:56,231 --> 01:29:59,166
Or he'll be too squiffy
to remember his lines.

1442
01:29:59,234 --> 01:30:02,670
Ah, Mrs. Croft, isn't it?
I wonder if I could...

1443
01:30:02,738 --> 01:30:05,172
Ah, yes.
Have a few words with you.

1444
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:08,175
- I'm Inspector Thom...
- Oh, I haven't got time for this now.

1445
01:30:08,243 --> 01:30:10,177
I'm doing
the breakfast.

1446
01:30:10,245 --> 01:30:13,840
It wouldn't take much time. Perhaps
you have a room where we could speak.

1447
01:30:13,916 --> 01:30:16,350
Oh, I suppose
you'd better come to my room.

1448
01:30:16,418 --> 01:30:18,352
Bertha, I'm leaving you
in charge.

1449
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:21,355
Dorothy, make sure those menus
go up on Her Ladyship's tray.

1450
01:30:21,423 --> 01:30:24,290
And get that filthy dog
out of here.

1451
01:30:26,361 --> 01:30:31,799
Honestly, these days the countryside's
getting more dangerous than Piccadilly.

1452
01:30:31,867 --> 01:30:35,303
But why one of the knives
from the silver pantry?

1453
01:30:35,370 --> 01:30:37,304
Doesn't make sense.

1454
01:30:37,372 --> 01:30:39,966
He must have forgotten
to bring one.

1455
01:30:40,042 --> 01:30:42,977
When you think of
what they have to carry about...

1456
01:30:43,045 --> 01:30:46,845
all those jemmies and torches
and skeleton keys...

1457
01:30:46,915 --> 01:30:49,850
it's a miracle anyone
ever gets burgled at all.

1458
01:30:49,918 --> 01:30:51,852
Oh, it's glacial in here.

1459
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,854
Get my fur, will you?

1460
01:30:53,922 --> 01:30:55,856
[Sighs]

1461
01:30:55,924 --> 01:30:58,085
Anyway, it wasn't in
the silver pantry.

1462
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,651
It's been missing
since yesterday.

1463
01:31:00,729 --> 01:31:02,663
Obviously
William had it.

1464
01:31:02,731 --> 01:31:05,165
And when the fellow surprised him
there it was,

1465
01:31:05,233 --> 01:31:08,669
On the table
as handy as you like.

1466
01:31:08,737 --> 01:31:12,833
Are any of the others getting up
for breakfast? The women, I mean.

1467
01:31:12,908 --> 01:31:15,342
I think Lady Lavinia
may be.

1468
01:31:15,410 --> 01:31:19,847
That settles it. Come back
at half past 8:00. I'll get dressed.

1469
01:31:19,915 --> 01:31:22,349
It's the greatest bore,
of course,

1470
01:31:22,417 --> 01:31:24,851
But I don't want
to miss anything.

1471
01:31:24,920 --> 01:31:26,854
[Sighs]

1472
01:31:28,156 --> 01:31:30,090
When I came back
last night,

1473
01:31:31,326 --> 01:31:33,760
I found this
on my dressing table.

1474
01:31:33,829 --> 01:31:35,763
What is it?

1475
01:31:38,767 --> 01:31:41,031
"This is your final warning.

1476
01:31:41,103 --> 01:31:43,196
If I've not
received an offer..."

1477
01:31:44,539 --> 01:31:46,973
Freddie.
What a stupid idiot.

1478
01:31:47,042 --> 01:31:50,307
Well, at least he's off your back now.
There's no one to tell.

1479
01:31:50,379 --> 01:31:53,109
At least no one's who's gonna
give him a job to shut him up.

1480
01:31:53,181 --> 01:31:55,547
[Door Closes]

1481
01:31:55,617 --> 01:32:00,384
[Laughs] oh, now,
he's quite the bonny lad, isn't he?

1482
01:32:00,455 --> 01:32:02,616
What's he up to these days,
this one, eh?

1483
01:32:02,691 --> 01:32:05,125
He's dead.

1484
01:32:05,193 --> 01:32:07,627
I don't know
what I can tell you.

1485
01:32:07,696 --> 01:32:10,631
Shouldn't you be looking
for signs of a break-In?

1486
01:32:10,699 --> 01:32:15,796
Mrs. Croft, I understand
no one has served Sir William
longer than you have. Is that true?

1487
01:32:15,871 --> 01:32:17,805
I'd better be off.

1488
01:32:17,873 --> 01:32:19,807
Might not see you again.

1489
01:32:21,076 --> 01:32:24,011
I'm only staying till
the police give the nod.

1490
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:26,013
But, Elsie,

1491
01:32:27,816 --> 01:32:31,252
You're not in any difficulty,
are you?

1492
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:34,254
What, apart from having
no home and no job?

1493
01:32:34,322 --> 01:32:36,313
Nah.
There's no worries there.

1494
01:32:37,392 --> 01:32:39,326
Yes, I was forgetting.

1495
01:32:39,394 --> 01:32:41,328
You were much cleverer
than I was.

1496
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:43,330
You'll be fine.

1497
01:32:47,202 --> 01:32:50,137
I wonder what Lady Sylvia
will do now.

1498
01:32:50,205 --> 01:32:53,641
If I were her, I'd set up
in London as a glamorous widow...

1499
01:32:53,709 --> 01:32:56,507
with all the gentlemen
chasin' me for my money.

1500
01:32:56,578 --> 01:32:59,069
I wouldn't.
I grew up in London.

1501
01:32:59,147 --> 01:33:02,275
- Is that where the orphanage was?
- On the edge. Isleworth.

1502
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:06,047
- And you don't get homesick?
- I don't think you get homesick
if you’ve never had a home.

1503
01:33:06,121 --> 01:33:09,386
You heard about Mr. Weissman's valet?
Turns out he's a fraud.

1504
01:33:09,458 --> 01:33:11,858
- He isn't Scottish at all.
- No!

1505
01:33:11,927 --> 01:33:13,861
I could've told you that.

1506
01:33:13,929 --> 01:33:15,863
Who is he, then?

1507
01:33:15,931 --> 01:33:17,865
Do you think
he's the murderer?

1508
01:33:17,933 --> 01:33:20,367
It's worse than that.
He's an actor.

1509
01:33:22,037 --> 01:33:24,471
[Weissman]
yes, I want you to wake him up.

1510
01:33:24,539 --> 01:33:26,973
How else do you suggest
I talk to him?

1511
01:33:27,042 --> 01:33:29,476
Yes. Right.
Well, what'd he say?

1512
01:33:29,544 --> 01:33:31,978
What, he's talking about
Clara Bow again?

1513
01:33:32,047 --> 01:33:35,483
Listen, you tell Sheehan I think
Clara Bow is a really nice person,

1514
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:38,485
And she's not coming within
ten miles of my picture.

1515
01:33:38,553 --> 01:33:41,044
I don't want her
in the fucking movie.

1516
01:33:41,123 --> 01:33:45,059
There is one thing. The bastard's
death may have saved my bacon.

1517
01:33:45,127 --> 01:33:48,563
For God's sake, be quiet.
What's the matter with you?

1518
01:33:51,399 --> 01:33:53,333
[Jennings]
Arthur.

1519
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:56,596
- Oh, are these tomatoes?
- Yes, milady.

1520
01:33:56,671 --> 01:33:58,605
That's exactly
what I want.

1521
01:34:00,075 --> 01:34:02,509
- Good morning.
- Good morning, dear.

1522
01:34:02,577 --> 01:34:04,511
[Gasps]
Have you heard?

1523
01:34:04,579 --> 01:34:08,777
It's too tiresome. That frightful
inspector won’t let anyone leave.

1524
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:13,787
So we're to be treated
to another day of Mr. Weissman
shouting down the telephone.

1525
01:34:13,855 --> 01:34:17,689
He has some problems with his work
in Los Angeles, I'm afraid.

1526
01:34:17,759 --> 01:34:21,217
Well, I must say,
he conducts his affairs very oddly.

1527
01:34:21,296 --> 01:34:24,697
Coming downstairs just now,
I thought I'd been transported
to a bar in Marseilles.

1528
01:34:24,766 --> 01:34:26,700
[Weissman]
Jennings? Excuse me. I'm sorry.

1529
01:34:26,768 --> 01:34:29,703
I'm expecting
a really important telephone call.

1530
01:34:29,771 --> 01:34:32,706
- Will you get me
the second it comes through?
- Very good, sir.

1531
01:34:32,774 --> 01:34:35,800
And I'd like, uh, oh,
tomato and eggs. Thank you.

1532
01:34:35,877 --> 01:34:38,141
[Jennings]
of course, sir, but...

1533
01:34:38,213 --> 01:34:41,649
perhaps you would prefer to
choose for yourself, sir?

1534
01:34:41,716 --> 01:34:44,947
What do you mean,
like cafeteria style?

1535
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:48,387
The Englishman is never
waited on at breakfast.

1536
01:34:48,456 --> 01:34:50,390
Really?
Well, that's interesting.

1537
01:34:50,458 --> 01:34:52,426
Because an American is.
Wow.

1538
01:34:52,494 --> 01:34:54,428
I'm going to
make a note of that.

1539
01:34:57,799 --> 01:34:59,733
Good morning.

1540
01:34:59,801 --> 01:35:01,735
Good morning.

1541
01:35:06,575 --> 01:35:09,510
I'd like some coffee,
Jennings.

1542
01:35:09,578 --> 01:35:11,671
There it is.

1543
01:35:11,746 --> 01:35:14,613
- [Weissman]
you haven't made a lot of friends.
- Ah.

1544
01:35:14,683 --> 01:35:18,744
Good. Good morning, ladies, gents.
[Clears Throat]

1545
01:35:18,820 --> 01:35:21,482
Um, I wonder...
Excuse me.

1546
01:35:21,556 --> 01:35:25,048
Uh, will Lady Sylvia
be coming down soon?

1547
01:35:25,126 --> 01:35:28,061
I shouldn't think so.
She has breakfast in her room.

1548
01:35:28,129 --> 01:35:30,654
Then she usually goes
for a ride.

1549
01:35:30,732 --> 01:35:33,667
Yes, but she won't be doing that
this morning, will she?

1550
01:35:35,203 --> 01:35:37,137
Well, I see.

1551
01:35:38,573 --> 01:35:42,600
Well, in that case,
I wonder, Lady Trentham,

1552
01:35:42,677 --> 01:35:46,773
If you would be kind enough
to join us for some questions.

1553
01:35:46,848 --> 01:35:48,782
If you wish, Inspector.

1554
01:35:48,850 --> 01:35:51,785
I'm afraid I won't be
much help,

1555
01:35:51,853 --> 01:35:55,220
But I suppose on a day like this
we all have to pull our weight.

1556
01:35:55,290 --> 01:35:57,724
[Ellen]Mr. Denton made
a right chump out of Mr. Jennings.

1557
01:35:57,792 --> 01:36:00,226
[Bertha]
Never mind that.

1558
01:36:00,295 --> 01:36:03,992
Did you hear about Sir William?
Apparently he wasn't stabbed after all.

1559
01:36:04,065 --> 01:36:07,000
Well, I mean, he was,
but that's not why he died.

1560
01:36:07,068 --> 01:36:09,002
He was poisoned.

1561
01:36:09,070 --> 01:36:11,004
That's what killed him.

1562
01:36:11,072 --> 01:36:13,006
The inspector
told Mrs. Croft.

1563
01:36:13,074 --> 01:36:17,135
They don't know why the killer
stabbed him as well,
but he must've been dead already.

1564
01:36:17,212 --> 01:36:19,646
That's why
there was no blood.

1565
01:36:19,714 --> 01:36:21,807
Dead bodies don't bleed,
you know.

1566
01:36:21,883 --> 01:36:24,818
Trust Sir William
to be murdered twice.

1567
01:36:24,886 --> 01:36:27,013
[Bertha Laughing]

1568
01:36:27,088 --> 01:36:29,022
Of course
he wasn't murdered.

1569
01:36:29,090 --> 01:36:31,524
Not that sort of murder.

1570
01:36:31,593 --> 01:36:33,720
Some ruffian broke in...

1571
01:36:33,795 --> 01:36:36,229
thinking the library
was empty.

1572
01:36:36,298 --> 01:36:39,859
Sir William surprised him
and paid the price for it.

1573
01:36:39,935 --> 01:36:41,869
And very tragic it is too.

1574
01:36:41,937 --> 01:36:43,871
I can't see that,
Mr. Jennings.

1575
01:36:43,939 --> 01:36:47,705
I don't think ruffians
go about poisoning people
and then stabbing the corpses.

1576
01:36:47,776 --> 01:36:49,539
Apart from
anything else,

1577
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:52,045
They're usually in a hurry
to get away, aren't they?

1578
01:36:52,113 --> 01:36:53,876
What are you suggesting?

1579
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:56,679
- I'm not suggesting anything.
It's just...
- Just what?

1580
01:36:56,751 --> 01:37:01,245
Well, it looks to me like Sir William
was killed deliberately, that's all.

1581
01:37:01,323 --> 01:37:04,258
No wonder they're not
letting any of us go.

1582
01:37:04,326 --> 01:37:07,261
Tough luck on whoever's
got any secrets to hide.

1583
01:37:10,665 --> 01:37:12,599
Now they've canceled
the shooting,

1584
01:37:12,667 --> 01:37:16,103
Muggins here has got to pull a luncheon
for God knows how many out of the hat.

1585
01:37:16,171 --> 01:37:18,105
- Is Her Ladyship back yet?
- No.

1586
01:37:18,173 --> 01:37:20,767
Then she'll have to take
what she gets.

1587
01:37:20,842 --> 01:37:22,776
[Ethel] Why would anyone
want to kill Sir William?

1588
01:37:22,844 --> 01:37:25,642
Well, he wasn't exactly
Father Christmas.

1589
01:37:25,714 --> 01:37:27,648
Get on with your work.

1590
01:37:27,716 --> 01:37:30,150
And take that filthy dog
out of here.

1591
01:37:31,353 --> 01:37:34,049
He made a few enemies
in his time, that's all.

1592
01:37:34,122 --> 01:37:36,056
What do you mean, enemies?
When?

1593
01:37:36,124 --> 01:37:40,117
Is this before the war, Mrs. Croft,
when you were a factory worker?

1594
01:37:40,195 --> 01:37:43,631
I was not a factory worker.
I was never a factory worker.

1595
01:37:43,698 --> 01:37:46,132
I was a cook
in one of his factories.

1596
01:37:46,201 --> 01:37:49,637
He had two in Isleworth and two
in Twickenham, and all full of girls.

1597
01:37:49,704 --> 01:37:51,638
So you can imagine.

1598
01:37:51,706 --> 01:37:54,334
Wasn't that risky with factory girls?
Suppose they complained?

1599
01:37:54,409 --> 01:37:56,343
Who to, exactly?

1600
01:37:56,411 --> 01:37:58,641
But what if they got,
you know, in trouble?

1601
01:37:58,713 --> 01:38:03,013
- What sort of trouble?
- Here, take these.
Whites only, all right?

1602
01:38:03,084 --> 01:38:05,018
Didn't happen
very often.

1603
01:38:05,086 --> 01:38:08,487
When it did, he arranged
to have it adopted.

1604
01:38:08,556 --> 01:38:11,116
But what if you didn't
want it adopted?

1605
01:38:11,192 --> 01:38:14,628
- Say you wanted to keep it.
- Then you got kicked out,
lost your job.

1606
01:38:14,696 --> 01:38:19,156
You can take my word for it,
he was a hard-Hearted, randy old sod.

1607
01:38:20,235 --> 01:38:23,534
Ah, come in, Miss Maceach...

1608
01:38:23,605 --> 01:38:26,904
- I'm Inspector Thom...
- [Constance]
This is all too tiresome and absurd.

1609
01:38:26,975 --> 01:38:28,909
He's making
the most dreadful fuss.

1610
01:38:28,977 --> 01:38:32,140
If you don't mind, I would like
to ask the young lady some questions.

1611
01:38:32,213 --> 01:38:35,740
Well, I'm not leaving,
if that's what you think.

1612
01:38:35,817 --> 01:38:38,752
Well, does it bother you
if Lady Trentham stays?

1613
01:38:38,820 --> 01:38:40,845
Why should it?

1614
01:38:40,922 --> 01:38:44,323
- Sir, someone's traipsed
a load of mud in down here.
- Not now, Dexter, please.

1615
01:38:45,393 --> 01:38:47,122
I understood
there was some...

1616
01:38:47,195 --> 01:38:50,460
difficulty between the late
Sir William McCordle and your employer.

1617
01:38:50,532 --> 01:38:52,966
This is too vulgar
to be believed.

1618
01:38:53,034 --> 01:38:56,526
I wasn't aware of that, sir.
They got on well as far as I could see.

1619
01:38:56,604 --> 01:39:00,165
- You were not conscious...
- Inspector, there's
a broken coffee cup down here.

1620
01:39:00,241 --> 01:39:03,836
Dexter, they have people to clear these
things up. You get on with your own job.

1621
01:39:03,912 --> 01:39:06,642
So you were not aware
of any trouble...

1622
01:39:06,714 --> 01:39:09,239
over the matter
of an allowance?

1623
01:39:09,317 --> 01:39:13,811
An allowance, I might add, that
Sir William's death has now made secure.

1624
01:39:15,723 --> 01:39:18,658
What sort of an allowance
would that be, sir?

1625
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:29,403
Ah, there you are.
[Chuckles]

1626
01:39:29,471 --> 01:39:31,803
Have you got
enough light?

1627
01:39:31,873 --> 01:39:35,809
Black on black? We don't want you
going blind on top of everything else.

1628
01:39:35,877 --> 01:39:37,811
They've got to be done,
Mr. Jennings,

1629
01:39:37,879 --> 01:39:41,315
But the outside staff
need them for the funeral.

1630
01:39:41,382 --> 01:39:46,012
I'm sorry that this business with Elsie
has landed you with so much work.

1631
01:39:46,087 --> 01:39:49,022
That's what comes
of being so reliable.

1632
01:39:49,090 --> 01:39:51,024
- Never mind me.
- Hmm.

1633
01:39:51,092 --> 01:39:55,688
Mr. Jennings, have you...
have you spoken to the police again?

1634
01:39:56,998 --> 01:39:59,057
Not yet, no.

1635
01:39:59,134 --> 01:40:03,571
I suppose they have to ask
their questions, don't they have to?

1636
01:40:03,638 --> 01:40:05,572
Well, yes.

1637
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:09,041
Will they be talking
to all of us?

1638
01:40:11,112 --> 01:40:13,046
I shouldn't think so, no.

1639
01:40:13,114 --> 01:40:15,309
Well, I'll leave you
to it, then.

1640
01:40:15,383 --> 01:40:18,147
Mr. Jennings.

1641
01:40:18,219 --> 01:40:22,656
You know... You know
I'd say anything you want me to.

1642
01:40:24,826 --> 01:40:26,794
- What?
- Anything at all.

1643
01:40:26,861 --> 01:40:30,490
I don't care what I tell them, if it'll
help you. Y-Y-You know that, don't you?

1644
01:40:30,565 --> 01:40:32,499
You've only to ask.

1645
01:40:39,140 --> 01:40:41,074
[Clears Throat]

1646
01:40:49,384 --> 01:40:52,319
So, let me, uh, let me pour you
a cup of tea, eh?

1647
01:40:52,387 --> 01:40:56,255
Yes, thank you. Would you mind
putting the milk in afterwards?

1648
01:40:57,392 --> 01:40:59,326
Of course.
Of course.

1649
01:40:59,394 --> 01:41:02,420
Don't know what came over me.
I usually put the milk in after,
but on that occasion...

1650
01:41:02,497 --> 01:41:04,931
- Sir.
- Not now, thank you.

1651
01:41:04,999 --> 01:41:06,933
So sorry.

1652
01:41:07,001 --> 01:41:11,097
Mrs. Inspector Thompson
prefers the milk in first,
so I get used to pouring it for her.

1653
01:41:11,172 --> 01:41:14,608
I don't know why. Some nonsense about
bacteria. You know what women are like...

1654
01:41:14,676 --> 01:41:17,110
Well, what wives are like.
[Chuckles]

1655
01:41:17,178 --> 01:41:19,203
No, she's a funny old...
Sugar?

1656
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:21,009
No, thank you.

1657
01:41:21,082 --> 01:41:23,016
Of course they'll give her
a good reference.

1658
01:41:23,084 --> 01:41:26,019
Otherwise they'd have to explain
why they're giving her a bad one.

1659
01:41:27,855 --> 01:41:30,016
- Mr. Parks.
- Robert.

1660
01:41:31,125 --> 01:41:33,059
Robert, then.

1661
01:41:33,127 --> 01:41:35,061
It's just...

1662
01:41:35,129 --> 01:41:38,565
last night when you said
you'd surprise me,

1663
01:41:38,633 --> 01:41:41,898
You didn't mean anything by it,
did you?

1664
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:44,404
Why?
Don't you like surprises?

1665
01:41:44,472 --> 01:41:46,633
[Jennings]
Where shall we begin? Yes, now...

1666
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:48,642
Oh, Mr. Stockbridge.

1667
01:41:48,710 --> 01:41:51,645
By now I assume
you are all aware...

1668
01:41:51,713 --> 01:41:55,149
that, uh, Mr. Denton has
been playing a trick on us...

1669
01:41:55,216 --> 01:41:57,650
by posing as a valet.

1670
01:41:57,719 --> 01:42:00,654
Since Sir William
was aware of the plan,

1671
01:42:00,722 --> 01:42:04,317
It is not for me
or anyone else to criticize it.

1672
01:42:04,392 --> 01:42:07,190
However, it does leave us with some
adjustments to make for this evening.

1673
01:42:07,262 --> 01:42:11,699
Um, Arthur, you will take over
dressing Mr. Weissman.

1674
01:42:11,766 --> 01:42:16,100
That leaves us the problem
of Mr. Novello, and I really
don't want to ask you, Mr. Probert.

1675
01:42:16,170 --> 01:42:19,230
- I don't mind, Mr. Jennings.
- Oh, no, no.
You've got enough on your plate.

1676
01:42:19,307 --> 01:42:21,241
I'll do him,
if you like.

1677
01:42:21,309 --> 01:42:24,244
Oh, that's very generous of you,
Mr. Stockbridge.

1678
01:42:24,312 --> 01:42:27,748
I suppose I could always
do it myself, of course.

1679
01:42:27,815 --> 01:42:30,181
It's no trouble.
It's only for a night or two.

1680
01:42:30,251 --> 01:42:32,116
Good. Splendid.
That's settled, then.

1681
01:42:32,186 --> 01:42:37,351
And I think we can leave Mr. Denton
to dress himself. [Laughs]

1682
01:42:37,425 --> 01:42:41,691
"The bastard's death
may have saved my bacon."

1683
01:42:41,763 --> 01:42:45,893
- What do you think he meant by that?
- Isn't it obvious?

1684
01:42:45,967 --> 01:42:47,901
Is it?

1685
01:42:47,969 --> 01:42:50,904
Well, perhaps he meant
that the investment
that Sir William had agreed...

1686
01:42:50,972 --> 01:42:53,770
would probably have to
be paid now... Sir.

1687
01:42:53,841 --> 01:42:57,607
What about that low shot that nearly
killed him that morning they were out?

1688
01:42:57,679 --> 01:42:59,613
- Sir.
- What is it?

1689
01:42:59,681 --> 01:43:02,616
We haven't dusted those things
for fingerprints yet.

1690
01:43:02,684 --> 01:43:04,652
Good.

1691
01:43:04,719 --> 01:43:07,654
Do you think that shot might have
been intended for Sir William?

1692
01:43:07,722 --> 01:43:10,418
- Well, it nearly took his ear off.
- Hmm.

1693
01:43:10,491 --> 01:43:13,927
Mm-Hmm. Well, thank you, Mr. Barnes.
You've been most helpful.

1694
01:43:13,995 --> 01:43:17,431
Perhaps you'd be good enough to ask
Commander Meredith to join us just now.

1695
01:43:17,498 --> 01:43:22,128
You-You won't tell him what I said,
will you, Inspector Thomas?

1696
01:43:22,203 --> 01:43:24,194
Thompson.
It's Inspector Thom...

1697
01:43:24,272 --> 01:43:27,207
Never mind.
Just go and fetch him up, please.

1698
01:43:28,309 --> 01:43:30,243
[Clears Throat]

1699
01:43:30,311 --> 01:43:32,245
- Sir.
- [Door Closes]

1700
01:43:34,315 --> 01:43:36,249
[Bell Ringing]

1701
01:43:36,317 --> 01:43:40,754
- We've only got this.
- I don't think mine's bothered.
She hasn't got any black here.

1702
01:43:40,822 --> 01:43:42,915
We've got
some new ones.

1703
01:43:42,990 --> 01:43:44,924
[Arthur]
you're a leech. You know that?

1704
01:43:44,992 --> 01:43:47,426
- George?
- They're coming in a minute.

1705
01:43:47,495 --> 01:43:49,429
The dressing bell's
just gone.

1706
01:43:49,497 --> 01:43:52,432
I'm going out of my mind.
I've read all my magazines twice.

1707
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:55,435
You couldn't pinch something
out of the library for me?

1708
01:43:55,503 --> 01:43:58,995
I don't care if it's Horse and Hound,
as long as I haven't read it.

1709
01:44:02,076 --> 01:44:04,010
Well, we are honored.

1710
01:44:04,078 --> 01:44:07,013
In case you've forgotten,
this is the servants area, sir.

1711
01:44:07,081 --> 01:44:10,517
Yours is at the top of the stairs
behind that door, sir.

1712
01:44:10,585 --> 01:44:12,519
Barnes, it was just a...
[Sighs]

1713
01:44:12,587 --> 01:44:15,522
- I wanted to explain.
- No explanation necessary, Mr. Denton.

1714
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:19,526
If you'll excuse us, some of us have
got real work to do. Come on, Arthur.

1715
01:44:19,594 --> 01:44:22,529
The accent was a dead giveaway,
you know. We all knew.

1716
01:44:22,597 --> 01:44:24,531
Robert,
I was just having fun.

1717
01:44:24,599 --> 01:44:28,000
Well, then perhaps you'd better enjoy
your fun in the drawing room, sir.

1718
01:44:29,337 --> 01:44:32,272
They're afraid you'll repeat things,
be indiscreet.

1719
01:44:32,340 --> 01:44:34,274
But I'm very discreet.

1720
01:44:34,342 --> 01:44:38,278
In Hollywood, that's what
I'm known for... my discretion.

1721
01:44:41,315 --> 01:44:44,250
[Isobel] Tell Rupert if you like.
He won't give you any money.

1722
01:44:44,318 --> 01:44:46,252
[Nesbitt] No, you're
completely misunderstanding me.

1723
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:49,255
And Mummy wouldn't pay
five pounds to save me...

1724
01:44:49,323 --> 01:44:53,089
Oh, my poor darling.
Come here. Come on.

1725
01:44:53,161 --> 01:44:58,292
Look, please don't think that I'm
enjoying this. All I wanted was a job.

1726
01:44:58,366 --> 01:45:00,300
My checkbook's
downstairs.

1727
01:45:00,368 --> 01:45:02,802
I'll give you a check
after dinner.

1728
01:45:07,909 --> 01:45:10,844
I'm trying to find my man Parks.
Have you seen him?

1729
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,846
Uh, no.
I've been with the police.

1730
01:45:12,914 --> 01:45:15,849
You look as if
you've had rather a pasting.

1731
01:45:15,917 --> 01:45:18,852
They kept on and on
about that low shot yesterday.

1732
01:45:18,920 --> 01:45:20,854
They wouldn't let it go.

1733
01:45:20,922 --> 01:45:23,857
- I told them it was
nothing to do with me.
- I'm sure you did.

1734
01:45:23,925 --> 01:45:28,362
- But another time, Anthony,
try to be less greedy. Parks!
- What?

1735
01:45:28,429 --> 01:45:31,364
Attend to Mr. Novello first.
I want a word with Her Ladyship.

1736
01:45:31,432 --> 01:45:33,366
Very well, mi lord.

1737
01:45:33,434 --> 01:45:35,868
- What?
- I saw you.

1738
01:45:35,937 --> 01:45:38,201
Of course
it was an accident.

1739
01:45:38,272 --> 01:45:42,868
When a man is as short as you,
it must be very difficult
to gauge the height of the birds.

1740
01:45:48,449 --> 01:45:50,383
- [Jennings] Mr. Meredith.
- Hmm?

1741
01:45:50,451 --> 01:45:52,885
You haven't seen Commander Meredith
anywhere, have you?

1742
01:45:52,954 --> 01:45:55,889
- No.
- He never came down stairs
and he's not in his room.

1743
01:45:55,957 --> 01:45:58,391
Mr. Jennings,
I've washed him and dressed him.

1744
01:45:58,459 --> 01:46:01,485
If he can't find his way to
the drawing room, it isn't my fault.

1745
01:46:01,562 --> 01:46:04,497
[Man] lf you've finished with that,
go and see Mrs. Croft.

1746
01:46:08,769 --> 01:46:10,703
[Gasps]

1747
01:46:10,771 --> 01:46:14,104
Oh, l-I'm so sorry, sir.
I didn't mean to disturb you.

1748
01:46:14,175 --> 01:46:18,271
No, no, no, Please.
I'm just trying some of your jam.

1749
01:46:19,514 --> 01:46:21,448
I must be in your way.

1750
01:46:21,516 --> 01:46:24,815
No, no. No, no.
No bother.

1751
01:46:24,886 --> 01:46:26,820
What one is that, sir?

1752
01:46:27,889 --> 01:46:29,823
Um, it's raspberry.

1753
01:46:29,891 --> 01:46:31,825
October 31.

1754
01:46:31,893 --> 01:46:34,327
You might like to try
the, um...

1755
01:46:35,396 --> 01:46:37,330
strawberry one.

1756
01:46:37,398 --> 01:46:39,332
Oh, is that strawberry?

1757
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:41,334
Let's see.
Ah, yes.

1758
01:46:41,402 --> 01:46:43,461
Mmm.

1759
01:46:43,538 --> 01:46:45,972
You all right, sir?

1760
01:46:46,040 --> 01:46:49,532
Just been with
the inspector and...

1761
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:51,544
I feel
a little bruised.

1762
01:46:55,082 --> 01:46:57,016
Mmm.

1763
01:47:03,524 --> 01:47:08,621
Why is it, would you say,
that some people seem to get
whatever they want in life?

1764
01:47:10,064 --> 01:47:12,498
Everything they touch
turns to gold.

1765
01:47:14,201 --> 01:47:17,796
Whereas others
can strive and strive...

1766
01:47:17,872 --> 01:47:19,806
and have nothing.

1767
01:47:21,709 --> 01:47:24,143
I wonder,
do you believe in luck?

1768
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:30,083
Do you think some men
are lucky and...

1769
01:47:30,151 --> 01:47:32,346
some men just aren't and...

1770
01:47:32,420 --> 01:47:34,752
nothing they can do about it?

1771
01:47:34,822 --> 01:47:36,756
I believe in love.

1772
01:47:36,824 --> 01:47:39,554
Not just getting it.
Giving it.

1773
01:47:39,627 --> 01:47:43,324
I think as long as you can love
somebody, whether or not they love you,

1774
01:47:43,397 --> 01:47:45,558
Then it's worth it, and...

1775
01:47:54,642 --> 01:47:56,576
That's a good answer.

1776
01:47:58,346 --> 01:48:00,280
Uh, I think
I've got to go.

1777
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:02,282
Must have finished dinner
by now.

1778
01:48:04,785 --> 01:48:06,719
Thank you.

1779
01:48:08,255 --> 01:48:11,189
[Constance] I thought the wine
was frightful tonight. Vile.

1780
01:48:11,258 --> 01:48:15,194
Jennings, old boy,
I'll have a bourbon.

1781
01:48:15,262 --> 01:48:19,028
We don't have bourbon.
We have ordinary Scotch or single malt.

1782
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:22,035
Ordinary for me.
I'm just an American.

1783
01:48:22,103 --> 01:48:24,037
[Constance]
Who cares? We know you here.

1784
01:48:24,105 --> 01:48:26,801
[Clears Throat]

1785
01:48:26,874 --> 01:48:31,311
Look, I understand that
this is not an ideal time,
but I would like to see you again.

1786
01:48:31,379 --> 01:48:34,576
Mabel is so clever
to travel light.

1787
01:48:34,649 --> 01:48:38,085
Why should one wear
a different frock every evening?

1788
01:48:38,152 --> 01:48:40,313
We're not
in a fashion parade.

1789
01:48:40,388 --> 01:48:43,983
No, and I wouldn't want to be.
Excuse me.

1790
01:48:44,058 --> 01:48:45,992
Difficult color,
green.

1791
01:48:46,060 --> 01:48:49,086
- What did she say?
- Mmm. Very tricky.

1792
01:48:49,163 --> 01:48:51,097
- Isobel.
- Excuse me.

1793
01:48:51,165 --> 01:48:54,157
- [Sighs]
- [Constance] It sort of draws you.

1794
01:48:56,237 --> 01:48:58,899
[Constance]
I'll have another look at it.

1795
01:48:58,973 --> 01:49:01,908
Oh, how this tune
used to make me cry.

1796
01:49:01,976 --> 01:49:04,945
- [Jennings] Certainly, sir.
- [Conversations Continue]

1797
01:49:08,683 --> 01:49:10,617
Very good.

1798
01:49:10,685 --> 01:49:14,781
- I promise you
I can pay back every penny.
- Just take it.

1799
01:49:14,855 --> 01:49:17,153
- [Constance] your bid.
- [Denton] I must say,

1800
01:49:17,224 --> 01:49:21,854
Your guests sleep in much more
comfortable beds than your servants.

1801
01:49:21,929 --> 01:49:24,864
- [Continues]

1802
01:49:24,932 --> 01:49:27,366
Excuse me.

1803
01:49:27,435 --> 01:49:31,872
- What did Isobel give to you?
What did Isobel give to you?
- Don't make a scene here.

1804
01:49:31,939 --> 01:49:34,032
- Ivor dear.
- [Mabel] No more lies, Freddie.

1805
01:49:34,108 --> 01:49:37,600
Would it be possible to play
something more cheerful?

1806
01:49:37,678 --> 01:49:40,613
We're all quite emotional enough
as it is.

1807
01:49:40,681 --> 01:49:42,615
- [Mabel Whispering] Give it to me.
- [Nesbitt] What?

1808
01:49:42,683 --> 01:49:44,275
Excuse me.

1809
01:49:44,351 --> 01:49:46,285
Freddie,
stop all your lies.

1810
01:49:46,353 --> 01:49:50,619
If you don't give it to me,
I will scream this house down.

1811
01:49:50,691 --> 01:49:52,784
- You don't believe me, try me.
- Anthony, there you are.

1812
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:54,953
- Where have you been?
- L...

1813
01:49:55,029 --> 01:49:58,123
- You know, you've missed dinner.
We can organize a tray for you.
- I don't want anything.

1814
01:50:01,035 --> 01:50:03,970
Try buying yourself
a new frock with that.

1815
01:50:06,540 --> 01:50:08,974
- We gave up, Louisa dear.
- Oh. Right.

1816
01:50:09,043 --> 01:50:10,806
[Meredith]
I'm so, so sorry.

1817
01:50:10,878 --> 01:50:12,846
Mmm, no coffee, George,
but I'll have a...

1818
01:50:12,913 --> 01:50:15,848
- Aah!
- I do apologize, sir.
Can't imagine how that happened.

1819
01:50:15,916 --> 01:50:18,510
You son of a bitch.
You did that on purpose!

1820
01:50:18,586 --> 01:50:20,520
Shall I fetch you
a towel, sir?

1821
01:50:20,588 --> 01:50:22,522
[Giggling]

1822
01:50:29,396 --> 01:50:31,330
- [Whispering]
- [Giggling] Oh!

1823
01:50:31,398 --> 01:50:33,662
- [Jennings]Arthur.
- Oh, dear!

1824
01:50:33,734 --> 01:50:35,668
Clean this up,
will you.

1825
01:50:35,736 --> 01:50:37,704
[Continues Giggling]

1826
01:50:37,772 --> 01:50:41,868
[Dexter] They were fishin'
Parts of her body out the Thames
from Richmond to Rotherhithe.

1827
01:50:41,942 --> 01:50:44,376
...- [Woman Singing]
- [Bertha] Some more tea, Constable?

1828
01:50:44,445 --> 01:50:46,879
I'll take that.
Thank you, Bertha.

1829
01:50:46,947 --> 01:50:49,177
No head.
No hands.

1830
01:50:49,250 --> 01:50:52,185
- Unfortunately, the body
had no distinguishing marks.
- What's the point in that?

1831
01:50:52,253 --> 01:50:55,689
- Won't it all be chucked out?
- I'll know I've left everything
in good order.

1832
01:50:55,756 --> 01:50:57,690
That's all I can do
for him now.

1833
01:50:57,758 --> 01:51:00,556
- Yeah, but he won't...
- Hey, leave him alone.

1834
01:51:00,628 --> 01:51:04,086
George has had his revenge on
Mr. Denton... hot coffee in the lap.

1835
01:51:04,165 --> 01:51:06,656
- [Gasping] Oh!
- Poor Mr. Denton.

1836
01:51:06,734 --> 01:51:09,100
Constable,
I'm glad I caught you.

1837
01:51:09,170 --> 01:51:14,039
I assume the inspector
won't keep everyone beyond tomorrow,
but I thought I'd better check.

1838
01:51:14,108 --> 01:51:17,544
- Well, we haven't spoke
to all the servants yet, so...
- Ah, there you are, Dexter.

1839
01:51:17,611 --> 01:51:20,808
- Come on, we're going home.
- I was just asking how long
our guests will be staying.

1840
01:51:20,881 --> 01:51:24,874
Mrs. Croft has meals to arrange,
and I know one of the housemaids
is anxious to get away.

1841
01:51:24,952 --> 01:51:28,888
I don't think there's any need
to worry about that.
I'm not interested in the servants.

1842
01:51:28,956 --> 01:51:31,891
Only people with a real connection
with the dead man.

1843
01:51:31,959 --> 01:51:33,893
I see.
Thank you.

1844
01:51:33,961 --> 01:51:37,294
- Do you have a light, Inspector?
- Yes.

1845
01:51:38,666 --> 01:51:41,601
Yes, I think we can let them
all go home, to be honest.

1846
01:51:41,669 --> 01:51:43,603
I've got their addresses,
after all.

1847
01:51:43,671 --> 01:51:46,606
Constable Dexter will be here
tomorrow morning to confirm that.

1848
01:51:46,674 --> 01:51:49,609
Don't you worry.
It doesn't end here. Oh, no.

1849
01:51:49,677 --> 01:51:52,111
Whoever he is,
I'll find him.

1850
01:51:52,179 --> 01:51:54,113
I always do.

1851
01:51:54,181 --> 01:51:56,615
Inspector.
Your matches.

1852
01:51:56,684 --> 01:51:58,618
Yes.
Thank you.

1853
01:51:58,686 --> 01:52:01,154
[Woman Continues]
- Life was so gay-

1854
01:52:01,222 --> 01:52:04,157
Uh, sir, I think
you'll find it's this way.

1855
01:52:04,225 --> 01:52:06,318
Well, yes,
we could use this one.

1856
01:52:06,393 --> 01:52:10,921
There is, I think, a way out that way,
but, yeah, we'll take your way.

1857
01:52:24,245 --> 01:52:26,679
Ohh!
Beg your pardon, sir.

1858
01:52:26,747 --> 01:52:29,341
Just collecting
Mr. Nesbitt's shoes, sir.

1859
01:52:39,927 --> 01:52:42,862
I think you'll find these stairs
are the easiest way up, sir.

1860
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:45,364
- Thank you, uh...
- George, sir.

1861
01:52:45,432 --> 01:52:47,366
George.

1862
01:52:52,406 --> 01:52:54,670
You naughty,
naughty girl.

1863
01:52:54,742 --> 01:52:56,676
[Giggling]

1864
01:52:58,579 --> 01:53:00,513
Poor bloke.

1865
01:53:00,581 --> 01:53:04,711
We were in the ironing room
the other night and one of
the visiting maids walked in.

1866
01:53:04,785 --> 01:53:07,219
Must think I did it
on purpose.

1867
01:53:07,288 --> 01:53:09,848
- You won't tell, will ya?
- I won't tell.

1868
01:53:09,924 --> 01:53:12,950
But you're lucky you're in the kitchen
and not under Mrs. Wilson.

1869
01:53:13,027 --> 01:53:15,962
She'd have sniffed you out
without any help from me.

1870
01:53:28,776 --> 01:53:31,711
[Mary] Do you think
Sir William was in love with you?

1871
01:53:31,779 --> 01:53:34,213
Nah. I was a bit of fun,
that's all.

1872
01:53:36,984 --> 01:53:38,918
And you?

1873
01:53:40,321 --> 01:53:42,255
I didn't love him.

1874
01:53:42,323 --> 01:53:44,257
I didn't mind him,
but...

1875
01:53:45,626 --> 01:53:47,560
I liked the way
he'd talk.

1876
01:53:47,628 --> 01:53:51,223
He'd only talk to me because
he was sick of her, but I liked it.

1877
01:53:51,298 --> 01:53:56,201
He used to say to me I could be anything
I wanted as long as I wanted it enough.

1878
01:53:58,339 --> 01:54:01,797
You're not sorry, then? Even after
the way things have turned out?

1879
01:54:01,875 --> 01:54:03,809
Nah, I'm not sorry.

1880
01:54:04,878 --> 01:54:06,812
It's time
for a change.

1881
01:54:06,880 --> 01:54:09,041
Who knows?
Could be the makin' of me.

1882
01:54:09,116 --> 01:54:13,109
What did he used to say?
Carpe diem. Seize the day.

1883
01:54:19,193 --> 01:54:21,218
What's up?

1884
01:54:21,295 --> 01:54:24,230
What did I say?
Where are you going?

1885
01:54:25,332 --> 01:54:28,768

1887
01:54:32,906 --> 01:54:34,840

1888
01:54:34,908 --> 01:54:38,469
- [Door opens]
- What are you doing?

1889
01:54:46,053 --> 01:54:47,987
You'd better go back
to your room.

1890
01:54:48,055 --> 01:54:50,489
You don't want to
get caught in here.

1891
01:54:52,726 --> 01:54:55,661
You didn't really dislike him,
did you?

1892
01:54:57,064 --> 01:54:59,328
Not really.

1893
01:54:59,400 --> 01:55:01,834
At least not enough
to kill him.

1894
01:55:09,910 --> 01:55:12,344
[Quavering]
You can't have.

1895
01:55:12,413 --> 01:55:14,677
You didn't know him.

1896
01:55:14,748 --> 01:55:17,683
You'd have to hate him.
And why would you?

1897
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:22,789
Can't a man
hate his own father?

1898
01:55:28,929 --> 01:55:30,897
Sir William McCordle...

1899
01:55:32,066 --> 01:55:34,000
was my father.

1900
01:55:35,803 --> 01:55:37,737
He didn't know it,

1901
01:55:38,806 --> 01:55:40,740
But he was.

1902
01:55:42,943 --> 01:55:44,877
You said
you were an orphan.

1903
01:55:44,945 --> 01:55:48,346
- No, I didn't.
I said I grew up in an orphanage.
- [Match Strikes]

1904
01:55:55,055 --> 01:55:58,491
Not long before I left,
a group of us broke in
to the warden's office one night...

1905
01:55:58,559 --> 01:56:00,493
and took out our files.

1906
01:56:01,829 --> 01:56:03,763
I found
my birth certificate.

1907
01:56:03,831 --> 01:56:05,765
Mother's name,
father unknown.

1908
01:56:05,833 --> 01:56:08,393
Found this photograph.

1909
01:56:08,469 --> 01:56:10,664
And they had
my admission form.

1910
01:56:10,737 --> 01:56:14,173
I was two days old.
Guess who brought me to the door.

1911
01:56:15,476 --> 01:56:18,707
- Robert, that doesn't mean that he...
- Yes, it does.

1912
01:56:20,447 --> 01:56:23,382
After that, I found out
she worked in one of his factories.

1913
01:56:25,319 --> 01:56:27,253
She wasn't the only one,
apparently.

1914
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:31,991
Either the authorities didn't know,
or they didn't want to know.

1915
01:56:32,059 --> 01:56:33,993
They took his babies...

1916
01:56:34,061 --> 01:56:35,995
and they took his money.

1917
01:56:37,965 --> 01:56:39,899
What happened
to your mother?

1918
01:56:41,502 --> 01:56:43,436
She died.

1919
01:56:47,674 --> 01:56:50,609
Is that why you took the job
with Lord Stockbridge?

1920
01:56:51,678 --> 01:56:54,112
To get to Sir William?

1921
01:56:54,181 --> 01:56:56,115
To poison him?

1922
01:56:56,183 --> 01:56:58,242
I didn't poison him.

1923
01:56:59,386 --> 01:57:01,320
What?

1924
01:57:01,388 --> 01:57:03,322
I didn't poison him.

1925
01:57:05,125 --> 01:57:07,059
But then you didn't
kill him.

1926
01:57:08,128 --> 01:57:10,062
Did you stab him?

1927
01:57:11,698 --> 01:57:14,690
Even if you did,
he was already dead.

1928
01:57:14,768 --> 01:57:19,171
And whoever did it must have
known that. No one could
stab a corpse and not know it.

1929
01:57:19,239 --> 01:57:22,402
Really? When was the last time
you stabbed a corpse?

1930
01:57:25,879 --> 01:57:28,347
You really murdered him, then.

1931
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:31,684
I don't know.

1932
01:57:34,354 --> 01:57:36,288
I don't care.

1933
01:57:53,106 --> 01:57:55,040
Ooh.

1934
01:57:57,511 --> 01:58:00,947
I've been wanting to do that
ever since I first set eyes on you.

01:58:37,784 --> 01:58:40,218
- [Continues]

1942
01:58:41,788 --> 01:58:44,222
Dorothy.
I need your help.

1943
01:58:44,291 --> 01:58:47,226
Of course, Mrs. Wilson.
Are you all right?

1944
01:58:49,296 --> 01:58:51,730
- No one must see him like this.
- Ohh.

1945
01:58:51,798 --> 01:58:53,732
Help me.

1946
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,734
- Mr. Jennings?
- Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1947
01:58:55,802 --> 01:58:58,737
- Come on. Bedtime.
- [Jennings Chuckling, Grunting]

1948
01:58:58,805 --> 01:59:02,502
- All right, bedtime.
- No, this way. Come on, Mr. Jennings.

1949
01:59:02,576 --> 01:59:05,511
Bedtime, Mr. Jennings.
Bedtime now. Come on.

1950
01:59:05,579 --> 01:59:08,013
[Jennings]
Where is r-R...

1951
01:59:08,081 --> 01:59:11,539
[Groaning]
Where is my reference?

1952
01:59:11,618 --> 01:59:15,054
[Mrs. Wilson]
You'll get your reference. Into bed now.

1953
01:59:15,122 --> 01:59:17,056
Into bed.

1954
01:59:17,124 --> 01:59:19,058
- Aah!
- Watch him. Watch him.

1955
01:59:19,126 --> 01:59:22,562
- [Continues Groaning]
- Take his trousers off, Dorothy.

1956
01:59:22,629 --> 01:59:26,065
I couldn't do that, Mrs. Wilson.
I couldn't do that.

1957
01:59:26,133 --> 01:59:28,567
Take his trousers off.
Come on.

1958
01:59:28,635 --> 01:59:30,899
- Come on.
- [Slurred] Dorothy.

1959
01:59:30,971 --> 01:59:33,439
[Incoherent Mumbling]

1960
01:59:42,182 --> 01:59:44,116
Who is it?

1961
01:59:44,184 --> 01:59:46,618
- Oh, I'm ever so sorry, sir.
- Sorry for what?

1962
01:59:46,687 --> 01:59:49,622
I'm supposed to get the fire lit
without waking you.

1963
01:59:49,690 --> 01:59:53,126
Why does everyone treat me as if
I were one of these stupid snobs?

1964
01:59:53,193 --> 01:59:56,128
I spent half the week
downstairs with all of you.

1965
01:59:56,196 --> 01:59:58,926
You can't be on both teams
at once, sir.

1966
01:59:58,999 --> 02:00:00,933
[Door Closes]

1967
02:00:01,001 --> 02:00:02,935
[Knock on Door]

1968
02:00:03,003 --> 02:00:04,937
It's official.
They're off after breakfast.

1969
02:00:05,005 --> 02:00:07,439
Thank God for that.
What about him?

1970
02:00:07,507 --> 02:00:10,943
He's going too,
as soon as he's seen Mr. Jennings.

1971
02:00:11,011 --> 02:00:14,105
Are you all right, Mrs. Croft?
You sound a bit funny.

1972
02:00:14,181 --> 02:00:16,615
Oh, just too many fags,
that's all.

1973
02:00:16,683 --> 02:00:20,141
They'll be the death of me.
Here, you finish it.

1974
02:00:20,220 --> 02:00:23,656
- Did you tell the police
any of that stuff in the end?
- I did not.

1975
02:00:23,724 --> 02:00:27,660
I'm sorry if I shock you, but the plain
fact is, he only got what he deserved.

1976
02:00:28,729 --> 02:00:30,663
There.
I've said it.

1977
02:00:31,798 --> 02:00:34,733
I can't stop thinkin'
about those girls.

1978
02:00:34,801 --> 02:00:39,465
- The ones that got, you know...
- Well, I'm not surprised,
the way you carry on.

1979
02:00:39,539 --> 02:00:41,973
Just see it never happens
to you, that's all.

1980
02:00:42,042 --> 02:00:43,976
It won't.

1981
02:00:44,044 --> 02:00:47,980
And even if it did, I know
I couldn't part with my baby,
not just to hang on to a job.

1982
02:00:48,048 --> 02:00:50,175
Well, I'm very glad
to hear it.

1983
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:53,185
- [Knock on Door]
- [Slurred] Who is it?

1984
02:00:53,253 --> 02:00:55,687
No, don't mind me,
Mr. Jennings.

1985
02:00:55,756 --> 02:00:58,691
Inspector Thompson's just asked me
to take one last look around.

1986
02:00:58,759 --> 02:01:02,695
- Is the inspector with you?
- No, we're working from
the station from now on.

1987
02:01:02,763 --> 02:01:05,698
See if we can't manage things
better from there.

1988
02:01:05,766 --> 02:01:08,963
What about the poison?
Have you traced that at least?

1989
02:01:09,035 --> 02:01:11,469
Hardly.

1990
02:01:11,538 --> 02:01:15,167
This house is a poisoner's paradise.

1991
02:01:15,242 --> 02:01:17,176
We found the stuff...

1992
02:01:17,244 --> 02:01:19,178
in practically ev...

1993
02:01:21,481 --> 02:01:23,415
every room.

1994
02:01:23,483 --> 02:01:27,886
Unfortunately, no one's
got a Police record.

1995
02:01:28,955 --> 02:01:30,889
Well, except you,
of course.

1996
02:01:30,957 --> 02:01:33,255
Perhaps the butler did it.

1997
02:01:44,805 --> 02:01:48,172
I had a brother who was
a conscientious objector.

1998
02:01:49,242 --> 02:01:51,608
He did a bit of time too.

1999
02:01:53,246 --> 02:01:57,182
Did they know upstairs you refused
to fight and were sent to prison?

2000
02:01:59,586 --> 02:02:02,020
I'd forget about it
if I were you.

2001
02:02:02,088 --> 02:02:04,522
Not everyone's cut out
to be a soldier.

2002
02:02:29,049 --> 02:02:32,485
- Did you remember the other boxes?
- Everything's in the car, milady.

2003
02:02:32,552 --> 02:02:34,486
Wonderful.
Good.

2004
02:02:34,554 --> 02:02:36,488
Darling,
here I come.

2005
02:02:36,556 --> 02:02:39,491
- Do you know,
I can't wait to leave this place.
- Let's go.

2006
02:02:39,559 --> 02:02:42,494
Christ, what are we
supposed to do now?

2007
02:02:42,562 --> 02:02:47,465
Freddie, do try to stop
being so frightened all the time.

2008
02:02:47,534 --> 02:02:50,469
- Darling, have I made the most
terrible fool of myself?
- Maybe.

2009
02:02:50,537 --> 02:02:52,471
- [Whispers] Bye.
- [Nesbitt] Anthony.

2010
02:02:52,539 --> 02:02:54,473
- Um, Anthony...
- [Whispers] Oh, God.

2011
02:02:54,541 --> 02:02:57,977
I wanted to remind you
of the conversation we had
at dinner the other night.

2012
02:02:58,044 --> 02:03:01,309
Um, perhaps this is not
the most appropriate moment,

2013
02:03:01,381 --> 02:03:07,286
But when you get to the Sudan
you're going to need an expert,
and I'm your man.

2014
02:03:07,354 --> 02:03:10,255
- Well, I want to know...
- Did you ask her?

2015
02:03:10,323 --> 02:03:13,156
- No, I didn't.
- I think, on reflection,
that's a good thing.

2016
02:03:13,226 --> 02:03:15,160
According to
the servants’ hall gossip,

2017
02:03:15,228 --> 02:03:18,163
She won't get any of her estate
till her mother dies.

2018
02:03:18,231 --> 02:03:22,292
- Honestly, Jeremy...
- Lf that's the case,
it's too long to wait.

2019
02:03:22,369 --> 02:03:24,303
You can do better.

2020
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:29,574
H-Have you
checked your room?

2021
02:03:29,643 --> 02:03:32,077
You mustn't
leave anything behind.

2022
02:03:32,145 --> 02:03:34,579
I'm sure Mummy's
going to sell the house.

2023
02:03:34,648 --> 02:03:37,481
Isobel.
Isobel. Isobel!

2024
02:03:38,685 --> 02:03:41,119
Sidney Kent's
taking over the studio.

2025
02:03:41,187 --> 02:03:44,122
He loves Charlie Chan
and he hates Winfield Sheehan.

2026
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:47,159
- Sir.
- No more rewrites,
and I can cast whoever I like.

2027
02:03:47,227 --> 02:03:49,161
Well, that was painless,
wasn't it?

2028
02:03:49,229 --> 02:03:51,163
No, it wasn't.

2029
02:03:51,231 --> 02:03:53,563
- Hmm.
- Not for me, anyway.

2030
02:03:54,901 --> 02:03:56,835
Careful, careful.
Watch yourself.

2031
02:03:56,903 --> 02:03:58,495
Whoa!

2032
02:04:04,144 --> 02:04:06,078
[Mary]
Do they know?

2033
02:04:06,146 --> 02:04:08,580
- No.
- Don't you think they might notice?

2034
02:04:08,648 --> 02:04:11,310
I don't care.

2035
02:04:11,384 --> 02:04:13,716
Hey, you there.
Where you going?

2036
02:04:13,787 --> 02:04:15,914
To the station.

2037
02:04:15,989 --> 02:04:18,389
Hey, you want a ride
to London?

2038
02:04:21,461 --> 02:04:23,395
Sure. Why not?

2039
02:04:24,731 --> 02:04:26,892
- Hop in.
- Thank you.

2040
02:04:30,437 --> 02:04:32,371
There you go.

2041
02:04:32,439 --> 02:04:34,373
Well, good luck.

2042
02:04:34,441 --> 02:04:36,375
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

2043
02:04:36,443 --> 02:04:39,378
At least I know that gives me
room for maneuver.

2044
02:04:42,816 --> 02:04:45,250
No, keep your hands
to yourself.

2045
02:04:45,318 --> 02:04:48,253
You Brits really don't have
a sense of humor, do you?

2046
02:04:48,321 --> 02:04:50,255
[Elsie]
We do if something's funny, sir.

2047
02:04:50,323 --> 02:04:52,757
- Mr. Jennings, can...
- Be quick about it.

2048
02:04:52,826 --> 02:04:55,761
Honestly,
it's getting so expensive,

2049
02:04:55,829 --> 02:04:58,923
By the time one does Jennings
and leave something for the housemaids,

2050
02:04:58,999 --> 02:05:02,435
One might as well
have taken a suite at the Ritz.

2051
02:05:02,502 --> 02:05:05,437
Tell me, what happened
to William's little maid?

2052
02:05:05,505 --> 02:05:07,939
I never saw her again
after that dinner.

2053
02:05:08,008 --> 02:05:09,942
- Elsie?
- Mmm.

2054
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:12,444
- She's gone.
- Ohh. That's a pity, really.

2055
02:05:12,512 --> 02:05:16,414
Thought it was a good idea
to have someone in the house
who's actually sorry he's dead.

2056
02:05:17,717 --> 02:05:20,652
Oh, there you are, dear.
Did you have a nice ride?

2057
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:24,554
I'm feeling rather guilty.
Apparently everyone's gone,
apart from you and Louisa.

2058
02:05:24,624 --> 02:05:27,889
- Why don't you stay for lunch?
- No, I must be off.

2059
02:05:27,961 --> 02:05:29,895
Leave you in peace.

2060
02:05:30,964 --> 02:05:33,228
Now, you will...
you will telephone...

2061
02:05:33,299 --> 02:05:35,893
about the funeral plans,
mmm?

2062
02:05:35,969 --> 02:05:39,735
- You don't have to come if it's a bore.
- Nonsense. Of course I'm coming.

2063
02:05:39,806 --> 02:05:42,741
Have you decided what you're going
to do about this Place?

2064
02:05:42,809 --> 02:05:44,743
[Sylvia]
oh, I don't know.

2065
02:05:44,811 --> 02:05:47,109
[Constance]
Will you keep it?

2066
02:05:47,180 --> 02:05:49,114
It's so difficult.

2067
02:05:49,182 --> 02:05:52,618
- I mean, does one really want
the bother nowadays?
- Mmm.

2068
02:05:53,987 --> 02:05:56,751
[Sighs]
I suppose I could shut it up...

2069
02:05:56,823 --> 02:06:00,122
and make a decision
when my head stops spinning.

2070
02:06:00,193 --> 02:06:02,684
Mrs. Wilson could manage
till you're ready.

2071
02:06:02,762 --> 02:06:06,027
Oh, yes, she could manage, all right.
Let's not worry about that.

2072
02:06:06,099 --> 02:06:10,365
No doubt she'll seize the opportunity
to get rid of the wretched Mrs. Croft.

2073
02:06:10,437 --> 02:06:13,668
- Why are those two such enemies?
- I don't know.

2074
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:17,039
Something to do with when they were both
workers in one of William's sweatshops.

2075
02:06:17,110 --> 02:06:20,045
Mrs. Croft was the senior then.
She was the cook.

2076
02:06:20,113 --> 02:06:22,877
And Mrs. Wilson
a lowly factory worker.

2077
02:06:22,949 --> 02:06:26,009
Now that she's got up in the world,
poor old Croftie can't abide it.

2078
02:06:26,086 --> 02:06:28,020
The usual rubbish.

2079
02:06:28,088 --> 02:06:33,025
- Was there ever a Mr. Wilson?
I can't imagine it.
- [Gasps] Nor could I.

2080
02:06:33,093 --> 02:06:36,529
Although, funnily enough,
I think there must have been.

2081
02:06:36,596 --> 02:06:38,530
Really?
You amaze me.

2082
02:06:38,598 --> 02:06:40,532
She might have
changed her name,

2083
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:44,764
But when she was working
with William she was called
something quite different...

2084
02:06:44,838 --> 02:06:49,298
Parks or Parker or Parkinson
or something like that.

2085
02:06:52,112 --> 02:06:54,046
- [Knock on Door]
- Come in.

2086
02:06:57,283 --> 02:07:00,218
- You're busy.
- No, no, I was just
checking the linen rotation.

2087
02:07:00,286 --> 02:07:02,720
If I'd have left it
to the maids,

2088
02:07:02,789 --> 02:07:05,724
The same 20 sheets would be used
till they fell into rags.

2089
02:07:14,801 --> 02:07:16,735
Why did you do it?

2090
02:07:23,810 --> 02:07:26,677
How did you know
it was him?

2091
02:07:26,746 --> 02:07:29,681
Was it the name, or did you
see the photograph in his room?

2092
02:07:29,749 --> 02:07:31,683
Ah, yes,
the photograph.

2093
02:07:32,752 --> 02:07:34,413
It's a miracle
that survived.

2094
02:07:34,487 --> 02:07:37,422
I remember his mother
putting it into his blanket.

2095
02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:40,425
I suppose she wanted him
to have something of hers.

2096
02:07:40,493 --> 02:07:42,688
Does he know
what happened to her?

2097
02:07:42,762 --> 02:07:47,290
They said she died
just after he was born.

2098
02:07:47,367 --> 02:07:49,801
Well, she didn't die.
She gave him away.

2099
02:07:53,373 --> 02:07:56,809
He Promised the boy would be adopted.
He said he knew the family.

2100
02:07:56,876 --> 02:07:59,811
Turns out we all
clung to that dream,

2101
02:07:59,879 --> 02:08:01,813
All us girls.

2102
02:08:01,881 --> 02:08:05,044
A better start in life
for our children.

2103
02:08:05,118 --> 02:08:08,383
And all the time he was dumping them,
his own children,

2104
02:08:08,454 --> 02:08:10,547
In some godforsaken Place.

2105
02:08:11,691 --> 02:08:13,625
And I believed him.

2106
02:08:14,694 --> 02:08:16,628
I suppose
it was easier that way.

2107
02:08:16,696 --> 02:08:19,995
My sister certainly
never forgave me for it.

2108
02:08:20,066 --> 02:08:21,795
Your sister?

2109
02:08:21,868 --> 02:08:24,803
Yes, Mrs. Croft.
She's my sister. Didn't you know?

2110
02:08:24,871 --> 02:08:26,805
She kept hers, you see.

2111
02:08:26,873 --> 02:08:30,331
It was very hard for her. She lost
her job, and then the baby died anyway.

2112
02:08:30,410 --> 02:08:32,844
Scarlet fever.

2113
02:08:32,912 --> 02:08:37,349
I made him take her back.
She never forgave me for that either.

2114
02:08:37,417 --> 02:08:39,851
But even if
Robert is your son,

2115
02:08:39,919 --> 02:08:42,854
How did you know that
he meant to harm his father?

2116
02:08:44,924 --> 02:08:49,361
What gift do you think a good servant
has that separates them from the others?

2117
02:08:49,429 --> 02:08:52,125
It's the gift
of anticipation.

2118
02:08:52,198 --> 02:08:55,690
And I'm a good servant.
I'm better than good. I'm the best.

2119
02:08:55,768 --> 02:08:57,702
I'm the perfect servant.

2120
02:08:57,770 --> 02:09:00,204
I know when they'll be hungry
and the food is ready.

2121
02:09:00,273 --> 02:09:03,208
I know when they'll be tired
and the bed is turned down.

2122
02:09:03,276 --> 02:09:06,439
I know it before
they know it themselves.

2123
02:09:09,415 --> 02:09:11,815
Are you going to tell him?

2124
02:09:13,419 --> 02:09:16,855
Why? What purpose
would it possibly serve?

2125
02:09:21,261 --> 02:09:23,661
What if they find out
what happened?

2126
02:09:23,730 --> 02:09:27,166
Not much of a crime
to stab a dead man, is it?

2127
02:09:27,233 --> 02:09:31,727
They can never touch him.
That's what's important... his life.

2128
02:09:32,805 --> 02:09:34,796
And your life?

2129
02:09:34,874 --> 02:09:37,809
Didn't you hear me?
I'm the perfect servant.

2130
02:09:37,877 --> 02:09:39,811
I have no life.

2131
02:09:41,381 --> 02:09:43,315
[Knock on Door]

2132
02:09:44,617 --> 02:09:46,551
Her Ladyship's
leaving now, miss.

2133
02:09:46,619 --> 02:09:49,019
[Mrs. Wilson]
Thank you, George.

2134
02:09:53,593 --> 02:09:56,027
Well, you should go now,
Miss Trentham.

2135
02:10:12,178 --> 02:10:14,442
- Here you are, Jennings.
- Well, good-Bye, Sylvia.

2136
02:10:14,514 --> 02:10:16,709
- Good-Bye. For you.
- Thank you.

2137
02:10:16,783 --> 02:10:20,776
Do let us know if there's anything...
anything we can do to help.

2138
02:10:20,853 --> 02:10:22,787
[Sylvia]
Are you going away?

2139
02:10:22,855 --> 02:10:24,789
[Louisa] No, not once
the shooting's finished.

2140
02:10:24,857 --> 02:10:26,791
Thank you for your help
last night.

2141
02:10:26,859 --> 02:10:28,793
You don't have to
thank me.

2142
02:10:28,861 --> 02:10:31,796
You know I'd kill
for Mr. Jennings if I had to.

2143
02:10:44,344 --> 02:10:46,778
[Mrs. Wilson Sobbing]

2144
02:10:48,147 --> 02:10:50,581
[Gasps,
Continues Sobbing]

2145
02:10:57,190 --> 02:10:59,124
Don't cry, Jane.
They'll hear you.

2146
02:10:59,192 --> 02:11:01,126
[Stifles Sob]

2147
02:11:04,597 --> 02:11:06,531
Come on.

2148
02:11:07,867 --> 02:11:12,304
You did what you felt
was best for him at the time.

2149
02:11:12,372 --> 02:11:14,306
I see that now.

2150
02:11:15,875 --> 02:11:18,309
[Whispers]
Lizzie.

2151
02:11:18,378 --> 02:11:20,312
I've lost him.

2152
02:11:21,514 --> 02:11:23,948
I've lost him.
He'll never know me now.

2153
02:11:24,017 --> 02:11:25,951
My boy.
[Sobbing Intensifies]

2154
02:11:26,019 --> 02:11:27,953
Oh, my boy.

2155
02:11:28,021 --> 02:11:30,455
Well, at least
your boy is alive.

2156
02:11:31,991 --> 02:11:34,425
He's alive.

2157
02:11:34,494 --> 02:11:36,428
That's what matters.

2158
02:11:52,912 --> 02:11:54,846
So, you're leaving.

2159
02:11:54,914 --> 02:11:57,474
Yes.

2160
02:11:59,318 --> 02:12:01,809
Good-Bye then.

2161
02:12:03,256 --> 02:12:05,520
- Good-Bye.
- [Stockbridge] parks.

2162
02:12:08,628 --> 02:12:10,562
- Good-Bye, my dear.
- [Stockbridge] Get in, Bennett.

2163
02:12:10,630 --> 02:12:12,564
[Constance]
Chin up, chin up.

2164
02:12:12,632 --> 02:12:14,566
[Engine Starts]

2165
02:12:14,634 --> 02:12:17,626
- [Constance Mutters]
What a relief to be going.
- What time is it, Jennings?

2166
02:12:17,703 --> 02:12:20,137
It'll take me a month
to recover.

2167
02:12:20,206 --> 02:12:22,140
- Oh, Mary.
- [Jennings] 12:35, milady.

2168
02:12:22,208 --> 02:12:27,145
Do you think if there's a trial
I might have to testify in court?

2169
02:12:27,213 --> 02:12:29,147
Or you?

2170
02:12:29,215 --> 02:12:31,649
I can't think of
anything worse.

2171
02:12:31,717 --> 02:12:36,347
Imagine a person being hanged
because of something one said in court.

2172
02:12:36,422 --> 02:12:38,356
I know.

2173
02:12:38,424 --> 02:12:41,359
And what purpose
could it possibly serve anyway?

2174
02:12:49,102 --> 02:12:51,036
[Sylvia]
Good-Bye.

2175
02:13:04,250 --> 02:13:07,185
- [Piano]

2176
02:13:15,161 --> 02:13:19,063
[Novello]
- Somewhere there's another land-

2177
02:13:19,132 --> 02:13:22,863
- Different
from this world below -

2178
02:13:22,935 --> 02:13:26,427
- Far more mercifully Planned-

2179
02:13:26,506 --> 02:13:31,170
- Than the cruel Place we know -

2180
02:13:31,244 --> 02:13:35,908
- Innocence and Peace
are there -

2181
02:13:35,982 --> 02:13:40,612
- All is good
that is desired-

2182
02:13:40,686 --> 02:13:46,454
- Faces there are always fair -

2183
02:13:46,526 --> 02:13:51,987
- Love grows never old
nor tired-

2184
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:56,727
- We shall never find-

2185
02:13:56,802 --> 02:13:58,827
- That lovely land-

2186
02:13:58,905 --> 02:14:02,272
- Of Might-Have-Been -

2187
02:14:02,341 --> 02:14:05,936
- I can never be your king -

2188
02:14:06,012 --> 02:14:10,415
- Nor you can be my queen -

2189
02:14:10,483 --> 02:14:14,715
- Days may Pass
and years may Pass -

2190
02:14:14,787 --> 02:14:20,089
- And seas may lie between -

2191
02:14:20,159 --> 02:14:23,185
[Echoing, Fading]
- We shall never find-

2192
02:14:23,262 --> 02:14:25,526
- That lovely land-

2193
02:14:25,598 --> 02:14:29,034
- Of Might-Have-Been...
