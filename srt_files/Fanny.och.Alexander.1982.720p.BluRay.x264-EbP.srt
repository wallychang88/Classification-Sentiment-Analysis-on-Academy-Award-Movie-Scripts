1
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,993
NOT FOR PLEASURE ALONE

2
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,090
Fanny.

3
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,054
Mother.

4
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,531
Siri.

5
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,453
Maj.

6
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:30,126
Grandma.

7
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:48,144
I am king of 17 lands.

8
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,230
Ηeed my command.

9
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,416
Alexander.

10
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,919
Ηow are things?

11
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,848
Would you like to play cards
before dinner?

12
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:12,241
THE FIRST ACT

13
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:23,377
THE EKDAHL FAMILY
CELEBRATES CHRISTMAS

14
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,922
It takes longer every year.

15
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,127
Worthy Joseph, do not fear

16
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:13,797
Thy angel is thee ever near

17
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:18,135
I come in haste to bring thee word

18
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:21,430
From thy creator and thy God

19
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:25,559
Mary and the child now wake

20
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,687
And quickly into safety take

21
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,149
Herod with his murdering hand

22
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,819
Threatens every man-child in this land

23
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:41,325
All this I have noted well

24
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,995
And shall do as you foretell

25
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:48,332
Praised be God upon his throne

26
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,127
Who thus protects my only son

27
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,188
Thus, good people, ends our play

28
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,525
It all ends well this holy day

29
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,278
The son of God, saved from the sword

30
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,281
Is our savior, Christ the Lord

31
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:24,660
We know that in his mercy mild

32
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:31,041
He guards every woman, man and child

33
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,545
Though far from Bethlehem we roam

34
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:37,714
The star in the east leads us home

35
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,802
Merrily may every light

36
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:45,806
Shed its radiance clear and bright

37
00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:49,017
A time of joyous Christmas cheer

38
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:52,312
We wish to all, both far and near

39
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:55,482
Let no one into darkness fall

40
00:12:55,608 --> 00:13:00,446
A Merry Christmas one and all

41
00:13:46,618 --> 00:13:51,622
Traditionally the Ekdahls give a party
for the theater staff down on the stage.

42
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,626
The guests are what you'd call
a rather mixed lot.

43
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:59,171
Quite different from what we're used to
here in the theater restaurant.

44
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,549
Nevertheless, I don't want to see
any supercilious glances,

45
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,594
snootiness, or raised eyebrows.

46
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,391
I want to see generosity,
warmth and kindness. Is that clear?

47
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,143
- Yes, sir.
- That's the spirit!

48
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:15,020
Alma and Petra,
take the Christmas basket.

49
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,647
I'll take the punch bowl.

50
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,320
- Are we ready?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,822
Forward march!

52
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,288
Come along, Carlchen.

53
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:17,708
We mustn't be late
to your mother's like last year.

54
00:15:21,212 --> 00:15:23,213
Come along.

55
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,215
Hurry up.

56
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,422
Merry Christmas!

57
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,595
Merry Christmas, Oscar.

58
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:18,935
Help yourselves, everybody!

59
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:23,940
Step forward, step forward.
Don't be shy.

60
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,737
When you've given Ismael his dinner,

61
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,991
turn off the lights in the shop
and lock up.

62
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,162
I have the key.

63
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,297
Good night, Aron.

64
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:49,466
Good night, Uncle Isak.

65
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,744
This is the 43rd Christmas
we're celebrating together.

66
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,746
My dear Ester, is it possible?

67
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,582
Yes, the 43rd.

68
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,876
Well, well, who'd have thought it?

69
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,420
Yes, it's odd.

70
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,381
Dear Ester.

71
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:37,908
Good evening, Mrs. Ekdahl.

72
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,743
Good evening, girls.

73
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:05,602
- Alida, you may join the other girls.
- Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

74
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,565
- Why are you so sullen?
- I'm not sullen.

75
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,192
I can see you are.

76
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,152
You're always sullen
on Christmas Eve.

77
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:17,948
- I don't know what you mean.
- You heard me. You're sullen.

78
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:23,620
Old hag.

79
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,803
My dear friends.

80
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,349
For 22 years...

81
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,730
in the capacity of theater manager,

82
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,275
I've stood here and made a speech...

83
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,323
without really having any talent...

84
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,245
for that sort of thing.

85
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:53,793
Especially if you think of my father,

86
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,132
who was brilliant at speeches.

87
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:11,436
My only talent,
if you can call it that in my case...

88
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,399
is that I love this little world...

89
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,112
inside the thick walls
of this playhouse.

90
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,994
And I'm fond of the people
who work in this little world.

91
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,921
Outside is the big world,

92
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:40,715
and sometimes
the little world succeeds...

93
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,720
in reflecting the big one...

94
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,601
so that we understand it better.

95
00:21:54,397 --> 00:21:58,316
Or perhaps we give the people
who come here

96
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:05,281
a chance to forget for a while...

97
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:18,503
for a few short moments...

98
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:25,010
the harsh world outside.

99
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:33,727
Our theater is...

100
00:22:37,648 --> 00:22:39,399
a little room...

101
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,486
of orderliness, routine, care...

102
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,116
and love.

103
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,456
I don't know why I feel...

104
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,672
so comically solemn... this evening.

105
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:08,845
I can't explain how I feel,
so I'd best be brief.

106
00:23:11,474 --> 00:23:13,391
My wife and I...

107
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,687
and the rest of the Ekdahl family,

108
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:21,149
my brother Carl -
I think Carl is here.

109
00:23:23,778 --> 00:23:27,447
We wish you all
a happy and joyous Christmas.

110
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:33,828
I hope we meet again on St. Stephen's Day,
strengthened in body and soul.

111
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,289
Merry Christmas.

112
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,402
Isak!

113
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,242
Merry Christmas.

114
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,637
I can't think where they all are.

115
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,348
They should have been here
a long time ago.

116
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:40,562
I expect Oscar is making
a long, dull speech.

117
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,438
I think I hear them
down in the street.

118
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:44,899
Ester, bring me my fur.

119
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,009
There comes my family.

120
00:25:28,986 --> 00:25:30,111
Merry Christmas.

121
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,197
Merry Christmas, Grandma.

122
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,991
Merry Christmas, Aunt.

123
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,079
Mama, you look so beautiful.

124
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,135
What is it, darling?

125
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,018
Aunt Emma, how nice to see you.

126
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:49,148
Aunt Emma, how nice. Welcome.

127
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,570
What time is it?

128
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:04,789
The only question is:
Where are Carl and Lydia?

129
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,000
Perhaps they got the wrong time.

130
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:11,045
Christmas dinner is always at 4:30.

131
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:16,509
Alexander, run down
and ring Uncle Carl's doorbell.

132
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,394
- Carlchen, please hurry.
- Shut up!

133
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,979
- We're so late.
- Shut up!

134
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:30,231
We arrive late every year.

135
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:36,154
- I'm doing this for your sake.
- No more, mein Carlchen.

136
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:45,038
- Mama.
- Well, Carl.

137
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:47,248
Merry Christmas, Aunt.

138
00:27:48,042 --> 00:27:50,793
Well, at last we can have dinner.

139
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,026
Now for the first
Sing hop faderallan lallan lay

140
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:18,905
And those who don't the first one take
will also number two forsake

141
00:28:19,156 --> 00:28:22,408
Now for the first

142
00:28:26,038 --> 00:28:30,208
Sing hop faderallan lallan lay

143
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:46,349
Cheers, Isak and Miss Alida.

144
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:55,691
I've got terrible heartburn.
I have to take a pill.

145
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,444
Mr. Jacobi, how awful!

146
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,446
The Ekdahls will be the death of me.

147
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:06,327
After last Christmas, I was in bed
for three weeks with kidney pains.

148
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:10,039
- You don't say.
- Worse than childbirth.

149
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,874
Does Miss Alida have children?

150
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:18,256
Good heavens, no.
Why do you ask?

151
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,843
I'm in need of a housekeeper,
Miss Alida.

152
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:28,391
Thank you, sir, but I like it
with the Ekdahl family.

153
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:32,145
Let's discuss it after the New Year.

154
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,065
Well, there's no harm in discussing it.

155
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:46,659
So you see,
my brother Gustav Adolf Ekdahl

156
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:50,746
is a magnificent human being.

157
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:56,419
Then you brown the breasts,
but use plenty of butter in the pan,

158
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,089
and fry some prime pork
at the same time.

159
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:03,926
Then you put the ground meat
on top of the breast,

160
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:05,803
and the pork on top of that.

161
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:10,099
Finally, you pour the port sauce
with mushrooms on top of everything.

162
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:15,062
Hey, Christmas gnomes
Let's raise our glasses and be merry

163
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:23,946
Our time on earth is brief
Full of toil and grief

164
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:28,784
Hey, Christmas gnomes
Let's raise our glasses and be merry

165
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,004
No appetite, Miss Ester?

166
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,424
Miss Vega, you're not eating
anything yourself.

167
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:45,468
It's not easy, I must say.

168
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:49,764
No, it's not easy. You're right.

169
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,976
It's unseemly,
all of us sitting together like this.

170
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,647
I agree with you.
It's unseemly.

171
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:01,192
Sitting together in the kitchen.

172
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,319
It was the old master who decided -

173
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:07,198
Be that as it may.
It's awkward nonetheless.

174
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,659
Yes, it is. It's awkward.

175
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:15,164
Well, Fanny, we're having
a pleasant time, aren't we?

176
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,959
I think dinner is taking too long.

177
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:22,046
You're wondering what
you'll get for Christmas, of course.

178
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,048
Aren't you, Uncle Gusten?

179
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:28,302
You're absolutely right, my dear.

180
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:32,348
I'm quite curious
as to what the evening will bring.

181
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,351
Frau von Bahlen.

182
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:42,942
My dear husband has implored me
to sing something after dinner.

183
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,989
I said I couldn't,
but he's so persistent.

184
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:54,203
He says my singing reminds him

185
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:57,707
of our youthful days in Munich.

186
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:02,378
My husband is so touching,
Frau von Bahlen.

187
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,006
Sometimes he's like a child.

188
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:09,802
Your father
is a magnificent human being.

189
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,722
You think I'm being sarcastic.

190
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:19,061
I'm never sarcastic
when I'm in good spirits.

191
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:24,442
So believe me, Petra, when I say...

192
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:29,572
Then you add carrots, sprouts,
red cabbage and cauliflower,

193
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:35,202
and then you pour cognac
over the whole thing.

194
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:40,082
We'II have to try it on Twelfth Night -
if we're still alive, of course.

195
00:32:57,017 --> 00:33:02,229
Dear friends,
I would like to make a speech.

196
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,858
But I'm not going to.

197
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:12,573
Cheers, Carl.
Short and sweet!

198
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:16,702
This is the 24th Christmas
I've celebrated with the family.

199
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:19,955
My dear Emma, is it really possible?

200
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:23,834
Yes, my Karl-Henrik died in '79.

201
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,170
Was it that long ago?

202
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:30,091
He'd be 98 years old
if he were living today.

203
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:33,260
My dear Emma, imagine that.

204
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,722
I was 19 when we got married.

205
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,433
You were only 19?

206
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,354
A great age difference.

207
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,899
There's no denying that.
But you were fond of -

208
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,777
My sister also married an older man.

209
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,488
Yes, I remember.
It was a magnificent wedding.

210
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:58,119
He died three months later,
leaving a fortune behind.

211
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,162
Karl-Henrik did no such thing.

212
00:34:00,330 --> 00:34:02,039
No, he certainly didn't.

213
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,713
Putte!

214
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,675
Try sitting up properly for once.

215
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:18,139
Elbows down and back straight.
You really have awful table manners.

216
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:22,351
Berta, since you're sitting
next to my father,

217
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,604
could you ask him for me
if I may be spared

218
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:28,023
being taught manners
on Christmas Eve?

219
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:33,070
- Siri.
- What is it, Jenny?

220
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:35,281
Are you mad about something?

221
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,118
Not at all.
Why do you ask?

222
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,371
You're not laughing
like everybody else.

223
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:46,167
Some people find it hard to laugh.

224
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,710
Why?

225
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:54,425
Some people bear a great sorrow,
for instance.

226
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,803
And it grows larger and larger
when others are happy?

227
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,391
For some people,
Christmas is a bit difficult.

228
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:04,852
Why?

229
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,898
Well, Jenny,
there are so many memories.

230
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:11,609
Maybe you'll be happy
by next Christmas.

231
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,570
Maybe.

232
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:16,906
Aunt Anna?

233
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:18,741
Yes, Alexander?

234
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,911
Since you're so rich,
you could get any man you please.

235
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:25,748
- You think so, Alexander?
- That's what Father says, anyway.

236
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,583
That's nice to hear.

237
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:31,253
So, you're leaving us
to get married, Miss Berta.

238
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,757
Yes, sir, I am.

239
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:38,260
Well, it's going to be
damned Ionely without you.

240
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:40,054
Both my wife and I -

241
00:35:41,348 --> 00:35:43,599
It looks like you'II have
some consolation.

242
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:50,689
Here's to old times, Miss Berta.

243
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:52,817
Cheers, sir...

244
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,568
and good luck.

245
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,578
A rhyme for the porridge.

246
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,708
"Our porridge is our strength and stay

247
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,879
It is our staple food

248
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,633
In joy, in grief, both night and day

249
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,178
It always does us good"

250
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,903
Look! I found the almond!

251
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:43,659
Four cheers for the coming year's
little bride-to-be!

252
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,502
Now it's Yule again, now it's Yule again
and Yule will last until it's Easter

253
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,838
That's not true of course
No, that's not true of course

254
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,882
For in between comes
Lent and fasting

255
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:46,388
What would Maj say to a little visit
in her room this evening?

256
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,766
The master must be joking.

257
00:38:03,573 --> 00:38:05,199
Are you all right, sir?

258
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,243
I'm fine.

259
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,398
I must help the girls with the tree.

260
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,780
Have you noticed that my old man
has begun to court Maj?

261
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,631
- Aren't you angry?
- Angry?

262
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:04,675
I think it's sweet.

263
00:39:18,148 --> 00:39:19,565
Children, come.

264
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:27,489
Uncle Carl is going to treat you
to one helluva fireworks show.

265
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,318
Stay here.

266
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:33,305
Ready?

267
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,032
Number one.

268
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,496
Now comes number two.

269
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,757
Now comes number three.

270
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,595
Bring the candle.

271
00:41:24,274 --> 00:41:26,733
"And it came to pass in those days

272
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,195
that there went out a decree
from Caesar Augustus

273
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,907
that all the world should be taxed.

274
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,203
And this taxing was first made

275
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:42,291
when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.

276
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:49,590
And all went to be taxed,
every one into his own city.

277
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,969
And Joseph also went up from Galilee

278
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:58,974
out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judea...

279
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:03,687
unto the city of David,
which is called Bethlehem...

280
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:08,108
because he was of the house
and lineage of David,

281
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:14,281
to be taxed with Mary his wife,

282
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,325
who was great with child.

283
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:21,538
And so it was
that while they were there,

284
00:42:21,915 --> 00:42:27,169
the days were accomplished
that she should be delivered.

285
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:32,716
And she brought forth her firstborn son
and wrapped him in swaddling clothes

286
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,886
and laid him in a manger,

287
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,514
because there was
no room for them in the inn."

288
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:07,417
- Give up?
- No!

289
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,616
I'm sorry.
It's a terrible mess in here.

290
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,206
Come see us later
and you'll get a Christmas present.

291
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,459
Thank you, Mrs. Ekdahl.

292
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,255
Now then, children, into bed.

293
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:02,222
Hurry up, Alexander.

294
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,433
To bed now, children.

295
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,504
Now say your prayers.

296
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:38,008
Thank you God for this day.
Please make me good.

297
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,093
May your angel stay by me
through the night.

298
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,929
God bless Papa and Mama,
Grandpapa and Grandmama,

299
00:44:43,056 --> 00:44:46,641
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

300
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:52,230
Vega, Ester, Maj, Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen
and Uncle Isak and everybody else.

301
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,440
Amen.

302
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:56,526
- Good night, Alexander.
- Good night, sweetheart.

303
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,825
Good night. Sleep well.

304
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,124
Putte kisses like a real man.

305
00:48:39,709 --> 00:48:42,043
Look at my Christmas present.

306
00:48:46,090 --> 00:48:48,383
Look what Mrs. Ekdahl gave me.

307
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:53,263
Aren't I beautiful?
Don't I look lovely?

308
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,473
I look like a real lady.

309
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:58,101
Don't you think?

310
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:05,025
Tonight you can't sleep in Maj's bed
because Maj will have a visitor.

311
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,157
And I can't just have
any number of men in my bed.

312
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:20,040
But you're Maj's sweetheart.
You know that.

313
00:49:43,773 --> 00:49:45,607
I think Mama should recite something.

314
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:47,275
No, my dear.

315
00:49:47,568 --> 00:49:49,778
Calm down, now.

316
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:53,239
Don't be shy.
You give wonderful recitations.

317
00:49:54,283 --> 00:49:58,536
No, I don't know.
I'll have to fortify myself.

318
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:01,539
I don't know what to read.

319
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,419
Well, you asked for it.

320
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:17,931
Alone I advance on my course

321
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:22,227
Farther and farther stretches the road

322
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:27,649
Alas, in the distance my goal is hidden

323
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:34,614
Dusk is falling, night fills the sky

324
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,703
Soon the everlasting stars are all I see

325
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,250
But I do not lament the fleeting day

326
00:50:46,335 --> 00:50:49,921
The coming night does not appall me

327
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:57,095
For of the love
that shines through the world

328
00:50:58,389 --> 00:51:03,101
A gleam has entered my soul

329
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:06,938
How beautiful.

330
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,582
Well, my dear ones,
it's time to say good night.

331
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,292
We're getting up early.

332
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:00,343
Carlchen! Wake up.

333
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,136
We're going home.

334
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:09,310
Good night, Mama.
Carl's a bit tired. I'II give him a hand.

335
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,855
Come along now.
We're going home.

336
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,323
Good night.

337
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,201
Good night, Mama.

338
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:39,674
- I stayed behind.
- So I noticed.

339
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:36,522
There she lies, the beautiful girl,
poor Arabella.

340
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,401
Little does she know what awaits her.

341
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:45,615
She's alone in the whole house.

342
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:53,748
Her mother is dead, and her father
is carousing with loose companions.

343
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:59,212
Who comes there as the clock
strikes 12:00 in the castle tower?

344
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:00,922
"Fear seizes me.

345
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:07,428
What is that terrifying white figure

346
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:12,350
floating on the moonbeams
and drawing near my bed?

347
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:19,565
It is my dead mother.
My mother's ghost."

348
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:29,158
No more noise in here now!

349
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:33,121
Go to sleep, children.
Good night.

350
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,962
I thought I smelled
kerosene in the nursery.

351
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:43,798
- Kerosene?
- Yes, kerosene.

352
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:48,302
There's no kerosene lamp
in the nursery.

353
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,471
Well, it smells like it anyway.

354
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,685
I'll go see what it could be.

355
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,486
It really does smell of kerosene.

356
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,325
Are you sleeping, you brats?

357
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,797
What have you been up to?

358
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,185
That's strange.

359
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:45,860
Yes, very strange.

360
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,368
This is a chair.

361
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,206
But not just any chair.

362
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:02,335
It might look like
an ordinary nursery chair,

363
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:07,465
made of wood,
humble and rather worn...

364
00:57:09,093 --> 00:57:12,762
but looks can be deceiving.

365
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:17,475
It's actually the most
valuable chair in the world.

366
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,270
It belonged to the emperor of China

367
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:26,567
and has by strange paths
ended up in the Ekdahl nursery.

368
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,737
But pay attention,
ladies and gentlemen.

369
00:57:31,573 --> 00:57:33,074
Look closely.

370
00:57:33,909 --> 00:57:37,411
Keep your eyes open.

371
00:57:38,205 --> 00:57:39,455
Look there.

372
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:44,127
Do you see the mysterious light

373
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:47,088
that radiates from that little chair?

374
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,551
That's right.
It glows from within.

375
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,095
Look how it shines.

376
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:57,181
Now I ask you, my children:

377
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:00,268
Why does the chair shine?

378
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:04,021
Why does it shimmer in the dark?

379
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,275
I'll tell you, but remember:

380
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:10,403
It's a secret.

381
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:15,283
Whoever reveals it will perish.

382
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:19,328
Do you swear to keep quiet?
- We swear.

383
00:58:20,289 --> 00:58:23,332
Not so loud.
Mother could hear us.

384
00:58:25,085 --> 00:58:27,545
And that would be the end
of the performance.

385
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:43,019
This is the most valuable chair
in the world.

386
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:50,276
It's made of a metal found
40 miles beneath the earth,

387
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:52,111
and only in China.

388
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,866
Though it appears
encrusted with diamonds,

389
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,454
it's much finer and more costly.

390
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:06,250
The chair was built 3,000 years ago

391
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,836
by the emperor's master jeweler

392
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:12,173
as a birthday present for the empress.

393
00:59:13,008 --> 00:59:17,803
She was very small in stature,
not much bigger than Fanny,

394
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,723
but she was the world's
most beautiful woman.

395
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:26,187
Her entire life she sat on this chair.

396
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,273
Two servants accompanied her
wherever she went,

397
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,859
carrying the chair between them.

398
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:37,531
When the empress died,
she was buried sitting on this chair.

399
00:59:40,619 --> 00:59:45,498
For 2,000 years
she sat in her burial chamber.

400
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:51,420
The chair shimmered in the dark,
its light shining right through

401
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,382
the empress's little figure.

402
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:59,220
But then a band of robbers came

403
01:00:00,055 --> 01:00:01,889
and broke into the tomb.

404
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:04,225
They knocked
the empress off the chair,

405
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:06,894
and she turned to powder and dust.

406
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,606
Then they made off with the chair.

407
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,904
Now it belongs to you.

408
01:00:19,074 --> 01:00:23,160
The most precious chair in the world
belongs to you.

409
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:26,998
Take care of it, for it's very fragile.

410
01:00:27,666 --> 01:00:29,417
It might easily fall to pieces.

411
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:33,879
Touch it gently.

412
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,552
Sit on it very carefully.

413
01:00:40,929 --> 01:00:42,263
Talk to it.

414
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:48,519
And at least twice a day
breathe on it.

415
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:24,472
What an idiotic little chair!

416
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:30,728
So worn and ridiculous!

417
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,649
And ugly, to boot!

418
01:01:39,654 --> 01:01:41,655
I'II be damned!

419
01:01:41,865 --> 01:01:46,243
I think the confounded chair
is trying to bite my rear end!

420
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,661
I'll show it!

421
01:01:47,788 --> 01:01:49,538
Don't do that!

422
01:02:17,609 --> 01:02:19,860
Have you all gone mad?
It's 3:00 in the morning!

423
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:22,363
We have to get up for church
in two hours!

424
01:02:22,489 --> 01:02:25,199
- Can we be in Hamlet?
- Please.

425
01:02:25,367 --> 01:02:29,412
I know you've spoken with Mr. Landahl,
but this is a matter for Father to decide.

426
01:02:29,538 --> 01:02:30,871
It's for Mother to decide.

427
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,707
It's much too late for children
who have school the next day.

428
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:34,834
No, it's not.

429
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:36,377
We can be pages in the first act.

430
01:02:36,545 --> 01:02:39,380
Who's not in the last act
can't be in the first.

431
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:43,092
It has to be different pages
in the last act anyway.

432
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:45,803
Good night, kids.

433
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:50,766
On the condition
that you do your homework...

434
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,981
and come straight home
after the court scenes.

435
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,861
And absolutely no whining
about getting up the next morning.

436
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:14,832
Here we go, Isak.
I've made some nice strong coffee.

437
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,960
Much better than Vega's
awful dishwater.

438
01:03:19,087 --> 01:03:20,754
Give this a try.

439
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,301
What can the time be?
Ten past 3:00.

440
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:27,720
We can sit for two hours,

441
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:30,473
and then I must change
for early service.

442
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:35,436
How good it is to have you here!

443
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,440
You're my best friend.

444
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:42,818
Whatever would I do without you?

445
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,124
Last year I enjoyed Christmas.

446
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,294
This year all I wanted to do was cry.

447
01:04:03,632 --> 01:04:05,925
I suppose I'm getting old.

448
01:04:07,302 --> 01:04:09,136
Do you think I've aged?

449
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,930
You've grown older, yes.

450
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,682
I thought so.

451
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,480
Yes, I just wanted to cry.

452
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:23,317
Though I love having
the grandchildren, of course.

453
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,696
I didn't think Oscar looked well.

454
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,991
He wears himself out
with that theater.

455
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:34,828
And the idea of him playing
the ghost.

456
01:04:34,955 --> 01:04:36,705
He should take it easy.

457
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,292
Besides, he's an awfully bad actor.

458
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,926
I wonder if Emilie realizes
that he's weak and needs rest.

459
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:53,347
I think I'II have a word with her.

460
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:01,230
He's capable, of course.
Capable and conscientious.

461
01:05:01,356 --> 01:05:06,110
Can you believe the theater
even makes a small profit?

462
01:05:06,236 --> 01:05:07,653
Isn't that splendid?

463
01:05:07,779 --> 01:05:11,699
A few years ago I contributed
a minimum of 50,000 kronor per year.

464
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,703
I didn't care, but Oscar felt
so awkward asking me for money.

465
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,206
Not like Carl.

466
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,752
He asked me for a new loan,
but I refused.

467
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:29,383
If he comes to you for money,
you must say no too.

468
01:05:29,509 --> 01:05:31,510
Promise me that.
- Yes, yes.

469
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,554
I don't understand it.

470
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,849
Time and again
I clear everything up for him.

471
01:05:36,975 --> 01:05:39,351
After a year, he's in dire straits again.

472
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:47,026
He says he doesn't go to moneylenders.

473
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,445
Do you know?
- No.

474
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:53,198
And that poor German woman
he's married to.

475
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:55,868
How could he have fallen for her?

476
01:05:56,911 --> 01:05:59,705
It must be something erotic.

477
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:02,166
What do you think?

478
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:05,544
Erotic? Yes, perhaps.

479
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,880
- You're not listening.
- Yes, I am.

480
01:06:08,006 --> 01:06:12,259
Never mind. The main thing is
that you keep me company.

481
01:06:20,435 --> 01:06:24,021
Carl and Gustav Adolf are oversexed.

482
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:27,149
They take after their father.
He was oversexed.

483
01:06:28,193 --> 01:06:31,362
At times I thought
it was too much of a good thing,

484
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:33,155
but I never refused.

485
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,283
Gustav Adolf is incorrigible.

486
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:40,746
I've spoken with Alma, and she wisely says
she doesn't mind his philandering,

487
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:45,000
because he's the kindest husband
in the world.

488
01:06:45,794 --> 01:06:48,921
It's fortunate that Alma
is so understanding.

489
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:56,553
Perhaps I ought to warn that nursemaid Maj,
or whatever her name is.

490
01:06:58,807 --> 01:07:01,767
I must say she's very pretty,
and good with the children.

491
01:07:02,185 --> 01:07:04,770
Beautiful coloring and a nice figure.

492
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,649
Pity she limps, the poor thing.

493
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:13,320
What you don't poke your nose into

494
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,323
you don't have to pull it out of,
as Grandma used to say.

495
01:07:19,327 --> 01:07:20,994
Are you asleep?
- No, no.

496
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:27,918
Carl and Gustav Adolf got too much,
and Oscar got nothing.

497
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:32,923
Imagine the tragedy for Emilie,
who's such a warm-blooded young woman.

498
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:37,511
When she was pregnant with Fanny,
she told me all about it.

499
01:07:39,222 --> 01:07:40,889
Poor girl.

500
01:07:41,641 --> 01:07:47,438
I have to say she's handled
her affairs in a most tactful manner.

501
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:52,526
Oscar and Emilie
are enormously fond of each other.

502
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:56,613
A happy marriage
in spite of everything.

503
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:02,369
Are you sad
because you've grown old?

504
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:07,124
I'm certainly not.
Everything's getting worse.

505
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:11,962
Worse people,
worse machines, worse wars...

506
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:14,131
and worse weather.

507
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,883
I'm glad I'II soon be dead.

508
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:21,013
You're an incorrigible old misanthrope
and always have been.

509
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:24,975
I don't agree with you.
- I thought as much.

510
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:28,562
That doesn't stop me from crying.

511
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,400
Would you mind if I cry a while?

512
01:08:47,874 --> 01:08:51,752
No, upon my soul, I can't.
The tears won't come.

513
01:08:52,754 --> 01:08:54,922
I'll have to have some more cognac.

514
01:09:07,435 --> 01:09:10,103
What are you laughing at?

515
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:15,651
Do you remember when we sat there
on the sofa kissing madly?

516
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:17,861
You had unbuttoned my blouse,

517
01:09:17,987 --> 01:09:20,906
and something else too.

518
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,659
Then suddenly the curtain
was drawn aside,

519
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,787
and there stood my dear husband.

520
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,041
It was just like a play by Feydeau.

521
01:09:32,377 --> 01:09:36,213
I screamed and you made for the door.

522
01:09:36,631 --> 01:09:42,511
He rushed off to get his pistol,
with me hanging on his leg.

523
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:48,600
You became friends for life.

524
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,144
Your husband was a greathearted man.

525
01:09:55,567 --> 01:09:57,818
Now I'm weeping.

526
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,114
The happy, splendid life is over,

527
01:10:02,782 --> 01:10:07,995
and the horrible,
dirty life engulfs us.

528
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:11,540
That's the way it is.

529
01:10:20,133 --> 01:10:24,052
This won't do.

530
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:26,263
I must wash up
and redo my makeup,

531
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:31,810
do my hair and put on
my corset and silk dress.

532
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:39,526
A weepy, lovesick woman turns
into a self-possessed grandmother.

533
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,613
We all play our parts.

534
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:47,159
Some play them negligently,
others with great care.

535
01:10:47,285 --> 01:10:49,453
I'm one of the latter.

536
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:55,334
Good night, my lovely Helena.

537
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,254
You were a sweet lover.

538
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,840
Like strawberries.

539
01:11:05,053 --> 01:11:08,055
You wanted me to help you
with your morning toilet, Mrs. Ekdahl.

540
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,349
The time is ten to 5:00.

541
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:16,521
A café on Castle Street.

542
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:22,527
Your own cakes and pastries,

543
01:11:22,654 --> 01:11:25,656
tarts and confections.

544
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:32,120
What do you say to that, little Maj?

545
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:37,209
You'd be in charge of it.

546
01:11:39,587 --> 01:11:42,047
Just yesterday I said to Alma,

547
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:46,385
"Look at Maj. She's a princess."

548
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:50,472
What breasts you have, my girl.

549
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:53,558
Let me see properly.

550
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,269
You drive me crazy.

551
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:58,897
Don't be afraid, child.

552
01:11:59,107 --> 01:12:02,401
I'm a wonderful lover.
All the women say so.

553
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:06,947
Once you get me on my back,
you'II forget about the café.

554
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,157
I swear.

555
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,118
Give me something to write on.

556
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:13,620
Come. Come over here.

557
01:12:16,457 --> 01:12:17,916
Here's a pen.

558
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,254
Now I'll write:

559
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,632
"Maja Kling...

560
01:12:29,554 --> 01:12:33,432
is the proprietress of my café."

561
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:37,144
Signed, Gustav Adolf Ekdahl.

562
01:12:40,815 --> 01:12:44,860
Christmas night, 1907.

563
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:49,281
There! That's a contract.

564
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:53,326
Stick it under a lawyer's nose
if I forget my promise.

565
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:09,843
Be careful not to put me
in the family way.

566
01:13:13,473 --> 01:13:17,642
Well, what do you say?
Aren't I nice?

567
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,812
Ever felt such a wooden leg?

568
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:25,192
Damnation!
The rocket went off too soon.

569
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:34,201
Oh, well, it happens.
Wasn't it wonderful?

570
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:38,205
You're a real billy goat, sir.

571
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:41,500
And you're my little lamb.

572
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:46,004
I must lie on my back.
I'm all in a sweat.

573
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:49,800
I ate and drank too much.
- You're not ill?

574
01:13:49,926 --> 01:13:52,969
Not me!
I feel like a bakery ablaze.

575
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:55,430
Or should I say café?

576
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:01,770
III? When I'm with
such a tasty little morsel?

577
01:14:01,896 --> 01:14:04,064
Sit on top of me.

578
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,359
Oh, you're impossible, sir!

579
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:15,075
Ride a rocking horse to Banbury Cross

580
01:14:15,201 --> 01:14:18,036
To see a fine lady on a white steed

581
01:14:18,162 --> 01:14:24,084
What a glorious time we're having!

582
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:44,271
- My goodness, how your heart's pounding.
- I've got a splendid heart.

583
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:47,983
Now you'll have to give me a new bed.

584
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:51,653
You'll have a café,
an apartment,

585
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:54,823
beautiful furniture, and a big bed.

586
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:58,493
- And pretty clothes.
- No one will be prettier.

587
01:14:58,619 --> 01:15:01,538
You will be Gustav Adolf's mistress,

588
01:15:01,664 --> 01:15:05,458
and I'II come see you
every Wednesday and Saturday at 3:00.

589
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:09,629
How silly you are.

590
01:15:09,797 --> 01:15:11,506
- What?
- I said you're silly.

591
01:15:11,632 --> 01:15:14,843
- Silly, am I?
- You're a real numbskull.

592
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:20,182
I'm not a numbskull!

593
01:15:21,434 --> 01:15:24,311
You are, for imagining
I'd want anything from you.

594
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:26,146
Don't you want anything?

595
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,815
Don't you see I was joking?

596
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:32,861
Joking?

597
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,491
In what way?

598
01:15:38,618 --> 01:15:40,327
Don't be angry.

599
01:15:40,453 --> 01:15:44,623
I'm not, but I don't like
being treated like an idiot.

600
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:51,087
Stop laughing.
- I think you're so funny.

601
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,522
I don't like being laughed at.

602
01:16:30,044 --> 01:16:31,878
I can feel a cold coming on.

603
01:16:32,672 --> 01:16:34,506
My throat hurts when I swallow.

604
01:16:36,384 --> 01:16:38,093
My teeth are tingling.

605
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,557
It's freezing in here.
Why isn't there any heat?

606
01:16:44,684 --> 01:16:48,311
We don't have any credit
with the wood merchant.

607
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,731
We owe 150 kronor.
Das weißt Du doch.

608
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,985
You haven't learned
a damn bit of Swedish in 23 years.

609
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:56,820
Speak Swedish!

610
01:16:56,946 --> 01:16:58,822
I do my best.

611
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:02,742
Last Tuesday I asked Mama
for ten thousand to sort out my affairs.

612
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:07,747
She took out a paper
that said I owed her 37,000.

613
01:17:08,749 --> 01:17:10,166
It's incredible.

614
01:17:10,543 --> 01:17:13,586
- You'II have to go to the Jew.
- I've already been.

615
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:16,923
I'm paying one hell
of an exorbitant interest rate,

616
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:19,592
and if I don't pay on time,
he'll show the IOU to Mama.

617
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:22,262
I have some jewelry.

618
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:24,431
Idiot.

619
01:17:24,849 --> 01:17:27,934
That would be nice. Professor Ekdahl
running to the pawnbroker.

620
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:32,230
Aren't you coming to bed?

621
01:17:40,114 --> 01:17:41,448
I feel ill.

622
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:45,660
There was something wrong
with the herring salad.

623
01:17:46,537 --> 01:17:48,288
It tasted stale.

624
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:54,127
I'm sure Mama saved it
from Easter, the stingy hag.

625
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,588
You don't serve herring salad
for Christmas, damn it.

626
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:03,845
Why did I marry you?

627
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:07,140
You're ugly, poor and barren.

628
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:10,643
You couldn't even give me a child.

629
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:14,522
You never make love to me.

630
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:17,859
Ich sage aber nichts.
- Speak Swedish.

631
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:23,198
Poor Carl.
You're so unhappy.

632
01:18:24,116 --> 01:18:25,825
If you weren't so anxious -

633
01:18:25,993 --> 01:18:30,163
The dean scolded me.
Said I'm neglecting my lectures.

634
01:18:31,916 --> 01:18:33,375
I'm a scientist,

635
01:18:33,501 --> 01:18:38,713
the only real scientist
in the whole damn university.

636
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,383
But nobody cares.

637
01:18:42,259 --> 01:18:43,718
Oh, my head.

638
01:18:45,262 --> 01:18:47,263
I have a terrible headache.

639
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:51,101
And we have to go
to that damn early service!

640
01:18:51,227 --> 01:18:53,812
Coercion at every turn!

641
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,565
No, Carlchen!

642
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:01,694
Then you have to smile matter-of-factly,
"Dear Mama, how beautiful you are.

643
01:19:01,821 --> 01:19:03,279
You look like a young woman."

644
01:19:03,406 --> 01:19:07,158
"Dear Emilie, I've never seen you play
the Christmas angel so wonderfully."

645
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:10,036
"How is it, Oscar,

646
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,831
that you succeed
in everything you do?"

647
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:17,710
How do you do that?

648
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:25,260
Come, Carlchen.
Come and sit by me.

649
01:19:33,936 --> 01:19:35,311
You smell bad.

650
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:40,108
Have you given up washing,
or are you starting to rot?

651
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:45,738
No. I don't smell bad at all.

652
01:19:47,074 --> 01:19:49,701
You have olfactory hallucinations.

653
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,633
It's bleeding.

654
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,516
- Shall I bandage it up?
- No.

655
01:20:17,188 --> 01:20:20,940
- Won't you try and get some sleep?
- Yes.

656
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:25,820
I feel sorry for you, mein Carlchen.

657
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,991
How is it one becomes second-rate?

658
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:36,039
Can you tell me that?

659
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,751
How does the dust fall?

660
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:43,129
When has one lost?

661
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:48,134
First I'm a prince,
heir to the kingdom.

662
01:20:53,474 --> 01:20:57,519
Suddenly, before I know it...

663
01:20:59,313 --> 01:21:00,980
I'm deposed.

664
01:21:04,193 --> 01:21:06,444
Death taps me on the shoulder.

665
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:11,157
The room is cold...

666
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:16,204
and we can't pay for kindling.

667
01:21:24,505 --> 01:21:26,339
I'm stupid and unkind.

668
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,510
And I'm most unkind...

669
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:35,181
to the only person who cares for me.

670
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,352
You can never forgive me.

671
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:42,021
I'm a shit and a cad.

672
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,860
If you'd like,
I'll make you a hot toddy.

673
01:21:47,987 --> 01:21:52,031
Don't be so damned servile!

674
01:21:53,867 --> 01:21:56,369
Wipe your mouth.
Your lips are always wet. It's disgusting!

675
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:01,916
I don't mean to be unkind.

676
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:07,213
Iknow that, mein Liebling.

677
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,760
Oh, life!

678
01:22:20,603 --> 01:22:25,481
Insomnia, poverty and humiliation.

679
01:22:28,694 --> 01:22:32,238
Stretch out your hand
and you grope in the emptiness.

680
01:22:33,616 --> 01:22:39,370
Why am I such a bloody coward?

681
01:22:55,721 --> 01:22:57,347
You have your amusements.

682
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:01,267
- That's enough, mein Liebling.
- Nothing troubles you.

683
01:23:01,435 --> 01:23:03,311
I strike you and you kiss my hand.

684
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:06,606
I spit on you and you forgive me.
You're repulsive!

685
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:09,275
I can't stand your love.
I have to get away from you.

686
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:12,153
You'II have to go back to Munich.
We're getting a divorce.

687
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:16,282
I want to finally be
spared seeing you,

688
01:23:17,242 --> 01:23:21,412
smelling you, listening
to your damned gibberish.

689
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:24,957
I'll be spared your solicitude,
your anxious eyes,

690
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,294
your cloying love.

691
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:33,132
When you're sad and unhappy,
you always talk like this.

692
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:35,718
I don't care anymore.
You know that.

693
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:37,428
I want to sleep.

694
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:42,141
Maybe I'll dream
of a sweet-smelling female body...

695
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,812
with small breasts and narrow hips,

696
01:23:46,730 --> 01:23:48,272
long legs...

697
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,984
dark hair and cheerful personality.

698
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,655
Her legs and arms
are wrapped around me,

699
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:58,574
pressing herself against me.

700
01:24:00,661 --> 01:24:02,328
We make love.

701
01:24:04,164 --> 01:24:06,666
Her flesh is firm and generous.

702
01:24:09,002 --> 01:24:12,255
Damnation!

703
01:24:13,924 --> 01:24:17,427
Old age, prison, disgust!

704
01:24:18,846 --> 01:24:21,055
No, Carlchen!

705
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:23,015
Stop! Stop it!

706
01:24:23,142 --> 01:24:26,352
Don't touch me, damn it!

707
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:45,872
You know why I hate you so,
mein Liebchen?

708
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,751
You're a mirror image.

709
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:54,046
Kindness reflects kindness.

710
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:56,215
Mediocrity reflects mediocrity.

711
01:24:56,383 --> 01:25:01,053
I see it contorting your face.
You suffer, but you endure it.

712
01:25:04,224 --> 01:25:06,559
That's the big difference,

713
01:25:07,394 --> 01:25:10,521
I will never endure it.

714
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:34,212
Good night.

715
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:02,824
Well, Gustav Adolf.

716
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:25,972
- Good morning, Papa.
- Good morning, Petra.

717
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:29,642
Don't I get a kiss?

718
01:26:34,147 --> 01:26:36,607
- Good morning, Gustav Adolf.
- Good morning, Alma.

719
01:26:40,654 --> 01:26:42,655
Go and fry three eggs
and some ham for Papa,

720
01:26:42,781 --> 01:26:45,533
and make two cheese sandwiches.

721
01:26:46,076 --> 01:26:48,286
What will you drink?
- Beer.

722
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:52,748
Petra, you know
where the beer crate is.

723
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:56,168
No, wait, I think there's some stout
in the cupboard.

724
01:26:57,754 --> 01:27:00,172
Would you rather have stout?
- Yes.

725
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:05,511
Don't stand there staring.
We have to be at Grandma's in an hour.

726
01:27:12,519 --> 01:27:15,021
- How do you feel?
- Cognac.

727
01:27:17,024 --> 01:27:19,650
- I've put out your clothes.
- Thank you.

728
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,404
And there's hot water
if you want a bath.

729
01:27:23,530 --> 01:27:25,114
That would be nice.

730
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:30,578
Hurry up now.

731
01:27:52,225 --> 01:27:55,603
You're a damned handsome woman.

732
01:27:56,063 --> 01:27:58,105
And you're a big shit.

733
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:12,286
- Come to bed.
- I just did my hair.

734
01:28:12,913 --> 01:28:16,666
We'II have a quick one standing up.

735
01:28:16,792 --> 01:28:21,087
- Petra's coming with breakfast.
- We'II lock the door.

736
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:25,424
Come on then, but make it quick.

737
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,471
- I don't think I can.
- You can't?

738
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,057
No. There must be something wrong.

739
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:21,814
- You're not sick, are you?
- I'm fit as a fiddle.

740
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:26,986
- Lie down on the bed.
- Yes, I guess I could do that.

741
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:35,703
- Shall I bring in the breakfast tray?
- Yes, please.

742
01:29:37,330 --> 01:29:39,206
To think that I haven't killed you.

743
01:29:49,342 --> 01:29:51,093
Now what do you say?

744
01:30:16,828 --> 01:30:19,038
I wonder if it will be a cold day.

745
01:30:20,207 --> 01:30:22,166
I think it'll be very cold.

746
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,127
My thermometer says 4º below.

747
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,778
Don't yawn at the table, Alexander.

748
01:30:55,992 --> 01:30:58,077
Cheers, brother Carl.

749
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,426
I heard the bishop
will be saying the service today.

750
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:15,928
Really?

751
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:22,309
I can't help it.
Your father's a bit nutty.

752
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:24,270
Excuse me.

753
01:31:33,071 --> 01:31:36,282
Well, my friends, it's time.

754
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:41,253
THE SECOND ACT

755
01:36:42,755 --> 01:36:46,300
THE GHOST REHEARSAL

756
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:15,537
My hour is almost come

757
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:19,875
when I to sulph'rous
and tormenting flames

758
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:22,544
must render up myself.

759
01:37:22,670 --> 01:37:24,838
Alas, poor ghost.

760
01:37:25,548 --> 01:37:27,257
Pity me not,

761
01:37:27,592 --> 01:37:31,470
but lend thy serious hearing
to what I shall unfold.

762
01:37:31,596 --> 01:37:33,722
Speak. I am bound to hear.

763
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:38,560
So art thou to revenge,
when thou shalt hear -

764
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:39,937
What?

765
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:43,357
I am thy father's spirit.

766
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:47,361
Doomed for a certain term
to walk the night,

767
01:37:48,112 --> 01:37:51,323
and for the day confined
to fast in fires

768
01:37:52,158 --> 01:37:56,411
till the foul crimes done
in my days of nature

769
01:37:56,996 --> 01:37:59,706
are burnt and purged away.

770
01:38:01,584 --> 01:38:04,044
But that I am forbid to tell

771
01:38:04,587 --> 01:38:08,423
the secrets of my prison house

772
01:38:08,549 --> 01:38:12,803
I could a tale unfold
whose lightest word

773
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:17,307
would harrow up thy soul,

774
01:38:18,309 --> 01:38:22,020
freeze thy young blood,

775
01:38:22,605 --> 01:38:27,859
make thy two eyes like stars
start from their spheres.

776
01:38:28,778 --> 01:38:31,405
But this eternal blazon

777
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:35,117
must not be
to ears of flesh and blood.

778
01:38:42,834 --> 01:38:44,626
List, O list!

779
01:38:45,003 --> 01:38:49,006
If thou didst ever
thy dear father love...

780
01:38:49,132 --> 01:38:50,424
O God!

781
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:55,846
Revenge his foul
and most unnatural murder.

782
01:38:55,972 --> 01:38:57,264
Murder!

783
01:38:57,390 --> 01:38:58,640
Yes, murder!

784
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:03,812
Murder most foul, as in the best it is.

785
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,440
But this most foul...

786
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,526
strange -

787
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:12,154
- And unnatural.
- Huh?

788
01:39:12,322 --> 01:39:13,864
And unnatural.

789
01:39:18,077 --> 01:39:22,080
Haste me to know't, that I,
with wings as swift as meditation

790
01:39:22,206 --> 01:39:24,833
or the thoughts of love,
may sweep to my revenge.

791
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:26,918
Now, Hamlet, hear.

792
01:39:27,295 --> 01:39:30,881
'Tis given out,
that sleeping in my orchard,

793
01:39:31,257 --> 01:39:34,009
a serpent stung me.

794
01:39:34,260 --> 01:39:37,179
So the whole ear of Denmark

795
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:42,601
is by a forged process
of my death rankly abused.

796
01:39:43,019 --> 01:39:47,189
But know, thou noble youth -

797
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,776
The serpent that did sting
thy father's life.

798
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:53,028
Huh? Did sting?

799
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:55,947
Thy father's life.

800
01:39:56,074 --> 01:40:00,035
Did sting thy father's life

801
01:40:00,495 --> 01:40:03,205
now wears his crown.

802
01:40:03,331 --> 01:40:06,124
O my prophetic soul! My uncle?

803
01:40:06,250 --> 01:40:09,920
Ay, that incestuous,
that adulterate beast,

804
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:13,090
with witchcraft of his wit,

805
01:40:13,216 --> 01:40:16,968
with traitorous gifts -

806
01:40:17,887 --> 01:40:22,391
O wicked wit and gifts,
that have the power so to seduce -

807
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:25,310
won to his shameful lust the will

808
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:30,899
of my most seeming-virtuous queen.

809
01:40:37,615 --> 01:40:39,199
But soft!

810
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:45,747
Methinks I scent the morning air.

811
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:53,713
Mr. Landahl,
shouldn't there be steps here?

812
01:40:55,258 --> 01:40:58,009
Can somebody help Mr. Ekdahl down.

813
01:40:59,137 --> 01:41:00,720
The steps were forgotten today.

814
01:41:06,894 --> 01:41:09,479
Brief let me be.

815
01:41:10,481 --> 01:41:15,902
Sleeping within my orchard
my custom always of the afternoon

816
01:41:16,904 --> 01:41:21,283
upon my secure hour thy uncle stole

817
01:41:21,784 --> 01:41:25,871
with juice of cursed hebenon in a vial

818
01:41:26,164 --> 01:41:32,002
and in the porches of my ears
did pour the leperous distilment,

819
01:41:32,670 --> 01:41:38,383
whose effect holds
such an enmity with blood of man

820
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,803
that swift as quicksilver
it courses through

821
01:41:41,929 --> 01:41:44,973
the natural gates and alleys
of the body

822
01:41:45,266 --> 01:41:48,894
and with a sudden vigor
it doth possess and curd,

823
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:54,483
like eager droppings into milk,
the thin and wholesome blood:

824
01:41:55,485 --> 01:42:01,531
So did it mine and a most
instant tetter bark'd about

825
01:42:01,824 --> 01:42:06,953
most lazar-like,
with vile and loathsome crust

826
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:09,706
all my smooth body.

827
01:42:13,336 --> 01:42:18,465
Thus was I, sleeping,
by a brother's hand...

828
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:25,680
of life, of crown, of queen,
at once dispatched.

829
01:42:26,516 --> 01:42:31,311
Cut off even
in the blossoms of my sin,

830
01:42:31,437 --> 01:42:37,359
unhousel'd, disappointed,
unanel'd, no reckoning made

831
01:42:37,777 --> 01:42:43,698
but sent to my account
with all my imperfections on my head.

832
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:48,662
Oh, horrible, most horrible!

833
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:51,998
If thou hast nature in thee,
bear it not.

834
01:42:52,375 --> 01:42:56,044
Let not the royal bed of Denmark be

835
01:42:56,212 --> 01:43:02,592
a couch for luxury and damned incest.

836
01:43:11,102 --> 01:43:13,436
I've forgotten what I am to do.

837
01:43:14,105 --> 01:43:16,356
You get up and exit upstage center.

838
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:41,381
- Where am I?
- Here... at the theater.

839
01:44:06,657 --> 01:44:08,658
Let's go home and rest.

840
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:15,790
What's happened?

841
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:18,460
You're tired, that's all.

842
01:44:19,003 --> 01:44:20,754
Shall I call for the ambulance?

843
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:27,510
What am I doing here?

844
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,848
You were acting.

845
01:44:34,644 --> 01:44:36,269
I was acting?

846
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:40,690
Why was I acting?

847
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,276
Come along, Oscar.
Let's go home.

848
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,576
Am I going to die now?

849
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:54,704
Please help me.

850
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:58,667
I'll get a carriage.

851
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:03,755
He needs his overcoat.

852
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:25,652
Alexander, come along.

853
01:45:46,382 --> 01:45:47,757
Come on.

854
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,358
Stop!

855
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:10,196
I said stop! Hey, you!

856
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:17,579
Take the cart behind you!

857
01:47:33,489 --> 01:47:35,114
Come along, Alexander.

858
01:47:44,041 --> 01:47:48,253
No.

859
01:47:49,839 --> 01:47:51,506
We know nothing yet.

860
01:47:53,175 --> 01:47:57,178
Yes, let's hope so.
Thank you for calling.

861
01:48:09,900 --> 01:48:13,486
- How is our dear Oscar?
- We can only hope.

862
01:48:43,559 --> 01:48:47,437
- How is he?
- It's a matter of hours.

863
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:50,899
- Is he in pain?
- He sleeps most of the time.

864
01:49:05,748 --> 01:49:08,875
Go see Ester and Vega
for hot chocolate and sandwiches.

865
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:21,054
I was over at the Gustavssons'
and I met Mr. Albrektsson.

866
01:49:21,430 --> 01:49:23,139
Just imagine, children.

867
01:49:23,223 --> 01:49:28,186
This letter will go all the way
to a mission in China.

868
01:49:29,396 --> 01:49:32,774
Mr. Albrektsson told me
his poodle had four puppies.

869
01:49:32,942 --> 01:49:37,445
A friend of mine
has lived there for 50 years.

870
01:49:39,949 --> 01:49:43,785
He wondered
if you'd like a puppy.

871
01:49:44,370 --> 01:49:46,746
Mama won't let us
have dogs or cats.

872
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:49,123
- We could keep it here.
- Really?

873
01:49:49,249 --> 01:49:50,667
- Yes.
- Splendid.

874
01:49:50,793 --> 01:49:52,752
Otherwise it'll be sold.

875
01:49:52,878 --> 01:49:57,590
When I was in China,
working in the fields with my friend,

876
01:49:57,841 --> 01:50:00,885
we had a dog and three cats.

877
01:50:03,305 --> 01:50:06,724
- Want to play again?
- You take red, then.

878
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:12,480
Mr. Albrektsson
makes lots of money on his dogs,

879
01:50:12,606 --> 01:50:14,565
but he wants to give this puppy away.

880
01:50:14,692 --> 01:50:16,359
He's wealthy in his own right.

881
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:20,321
It's his wife's money, dear Ester.

882
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:30,039
Would you two like
a molasses sandwich?

883
01:50:30,666 --> 01:50:32,750
Yes, please, Miss Vega.

884
01:50:35,254 --> 01:50:37,588
There, the letter's finished.

885
01:50:38,048 --> 01:50:40,508
Come, Fanny,
and I'll let you lick the envelope.

886
01:50:46,515 --> 01:50:49,767
- Would you like to borrow the flute?
- No, thank you.

887
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:54,272
- You want to lick the stamp?
- No, thank you.

888
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,442
You lick the stamp, then.

889
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:04,198
Thank you, sweetheart.

890
01:51:07,703 --> 01:51:09,120
Leave me alone.

891
01:51:24,970 --> 01:51:26,220
Come in.

892
01:51:36,774 --> 01:51:38,691
Your mama asked me to come get you.

893
01:51:40,069 --> 01:51:41,944
Let's put down the sandwiches.

894
01:51:59,171 --> 01:52:00,922
Hurry up, Alexander.

895
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:02,066
Come, Alexander.
Don't be afraid.

896
01:53:12,828 --> 01:53:14,495
Come here, Alexander.

897
01:53:19,168 --> 01:53:20,626
Come on.

898
01:54:12,554 --> 01:54:14,305
I'II wait outside.

899
01:54:18,435 --> 01:54:19,769
Come here, Fanny.

900
01:54:35,619 --> 01:54:38,746
Tell Alexander
there's nothing to be afraid of.

901
01:54:38,872 --> 01:54:40,915
I'II tell him.

902
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:51,509
You needn't be afraid.

903
01:54:53,887 --> 01:54:56,013
This is nothing to worry about.

904
01:54:58,267 --> 01:55:00,059
I feel no pain.

905
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:08,401
I actually feel better
than I have in a long time.

906
01:55:12,489 --> 01:55:17,118
Don't be alarmed
if I keep my eyes closed.

907
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:22,707
The light seems rather bright.

908
01:55:25,294 --> 01:55:30,089
It doesn't matter if I close my eyes.

909
01:55:40,684 --> 01:55:45,604
I could play the ghost now...

910
01:55:48,233 --> 01:55:49,608
really well.

911
01:55:58,827 --> 01:55:59,910
Nothing.

912
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:05,374
Nothing...

913
01:56:07,336 --> 01:56:09,253
separates me from all of you.

914
01:56:09,880 --> 01:56:11,339
Not now...

915
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:14,133
and not later.

916
01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:18,846
I know that.

917
01:56:24,186 --> 01:56:25,644
I see it...

918
01:56:28,231 --> 01:56:30,858
quite clearly.

919
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:35,196
I'll be closer to you now...

920
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:39,200
than when I lived.

921
01:56:45,040 --> 01:56:47,249
Now I'd like to look at Alexander.

922
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:03,349
Father says there's nothing
to be afraid of.

923
01:57:13,944 --> 01:57:15,945
Don't be childish now.

924
01:57:16,238 --> 01:57:19,281
Try to be a good boy.

925
01:58:09,958 --> 01:58:12,334
Take care of the theater.

926
01:58:13,795 --> 01:58:19,467
Mr. Sandblad will explain
the business side.

927
01:58:21,803 --> 01:58:26,307
Artistic matters
you'll decide on your own...

928
01:58:29,144 --> 01:58:30,728
as usual.

929
01:58:36,026 --> 01:58:38,110
A simple funeral.

930
01:58:39,237 --> 01:58:40,529
Don't forget.

931
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:46,160
Nothing majestic in the cathedral...

932
01:58:47,996 --> 01:58:50,080
with Chopin's "Funeral March."

933
01:58:53,585 --> 01:58:54,960
Promise me that.

934
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:16,649
Everything must go on as usual.

935
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:23,239
I'll soon be dead.

936
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,744
Will you hold my hand?

937
01:59:32,624 --> 01:59:35,501
Eternity, Emilie.

938
01:59:37,045 --> 01:59:38,504
Eternity.

939
02:01:43,213 --> 02:01:45,506
Fanny, wake up.
You hear that?

940
02:03:44,501 --> 02:03:46,043
My condolences.

941
02:03:51,716 --> 02:03:54,676
Allow me to assure you

942
02:03:55,303 --> 02:03:59,014
that my family and I
feel the very greatest sympathy

943
02:03:59,474 --> 02:04:04,061
in this difficult hour that has befallen
you and your esteemed family.

944
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:08,816
It is our regiment's duty and honor,

945
02:04:09,317 --> 02:04:12,569
in keeping with our proud tradition,

946
02:04:12,695 --> 02:04:17,616
to be allowed to express
our sympathy at the funeral service.

947
02:04:19,285 --> 02:04:24,498
Allow me to kiss your hand
in veneration and affection...

948
02:04:26,167 --> 02:04:31,463
and venture so boldly as to offer
all the support an imperfect mortal can.

949
02:04:43,351 --> 02:04:46,186
Alexander, come out.
The bishop will be here any moment.

950
02:04:46,312 --> 02:04:47,437
I don't give a damn!

951
02:04:47,522 --> 02:04:49,481
Come out now.
Don't be stupid.

952
02:05:28,938 --> 02:05:30,939
My deepest sympathy.

953
02:06:14,484 --> 02:06:16,610
My dear Emilie Ekdahl...

954
02:06:18,947 --> 02:06:20,739
words are so inadequate.

955
02:06:45,348 --> 02:06:47,224
Let's gather together.

956
02:06:52,480 --> 02:06:53,730
Right foot.

957
02:07:11,582 --> 02:07:17,129
It is with dismay that we gather
around Oscar's bier.

958
02:07:18,506 --> 02:07:24,302
A close friend has been taken,
and we're left in distress.

959
02:07:26,889 --> 02:07:32,310
We actors, who daily play
with life and death,

960
02:07:32,937 --> 02:07:35,439
should not be so upset,

961
02:07:36,232 --> 02:07:41,028
but oddly enough,
our dismay is greater -

962
02:07:42,530 --> 02:07:44,031
greater than others'.

963
02:08:17,065 --> 02:08:19,691
The hour before he died,
he was conscious.

964
02:08:20,401 --> 02:08:22,069
He even laughed.

965
02:08:24,906 --> 02:08:27,074
We spoke of practical things...

966
02:08:28,409 --> 02:08:30,160
the children's future

967
02:08:31,496 --> 02:08:33,538
and business matters.

968
02:08:47,345 --> 02:08:49,429
We also spoke of our theater.

969
02:08:50,848 --> 02:08:52,265
Oscar said,

970
02:08:53,476 --> 02:08:56,770
"Everything must go on
as usual, Emilie."

971
02:09:00,608 --> 02:09:02,734
So we'll carry on as usual.

972
02:09:04,195 --> 02:09:07,280
At Oscar's request, I'll take over
management of the theater.

973
02:09:08,783 --> 02:09:10,909
We resume rehearsals tomorrow.

974
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:15,622
The premiere of Hamlet
will proceed as announced.

975
02:09:18,626 --> 02:09:20,168
That's everything.

976
02:09:21,295 --> 02:09:23,672
We'll all do our best.

977
02:09:25,007 --> 02:09:26,925
Thank you.

978
02:09:28,136 --> 02:09:29,803
Dear Emilie.

979
02:09:38,312 --> 02:09:39,938
Oscar will be proud.

980
02:09:46,529 --> 02:09:49,656
I'm so happy for your sake,
dear Emilie.

981
02:11:04,941 --> 02:11:08,026
Cock, piss, shit, fart,

982
02:11:08,152 --> 02:11:11,029
piss, hell, shit,

983
02:11:11,155 --> 02:11:14,366
cock, fart, shit, piss,

984
02:11:14,492 --> 02:11:18,411
fart, cock, cunt, damn, hell,

985
02:11:18,579 --> 02:11:22,749
crap, ass, piss, cock, butt, pussy.

986
02:12:09,463 --> 02:12:12,757
Siri, tell the children
they may leave the table.

987
02:12:12,883 --> 02:12:14,217
Yes, ma'am.

988
02:13:16,489 --> 02:13:18,114
Did you hear something?

989
02:13:36,217 --> 02:13:38,051
Alexander, wake up!

990
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:40,303
There's something out there.

991
02:14:41,949 --> 02:14:44,826
THE THIRD ACT

992
02:14:46,537 --> 02:14:49,581
BREAKUP

993
02:14:55,004 --> 02:14:58,715
When that I was and a little tiny boy

994
02:14:58,841 --> 02:15:03,178
With a hey, ho, the wind and the rain

995
02:15:03,304 --> 02:15:07,807
A foolish thing was but a toy

996
02:15:08,142 --> 02:15:12,145
For the rain it raineth every day

997
02:15:12,313 --> 02:15:15,940
Did you hear Emilie wants to talk
to us after the performance?

998
02:15:17,151 --> 02:15:18,818
Doesn't sound good.

999
02:15:19,904 --> 02:15:21,321
No.

1000
02:15:21,447 --> 02:15:25,492
But when I came to man's estate

1001
02:15:25,618 --> 02:15:30,121
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain

1002
02:15:30,247 --> 02:15:34,792
'Gainst knaves and thieves
men shut their gate

1003
02:15:35,169 --> 02:15:39,506
For the rain it raineth every day

1004
02:15:53,229 --> 02:15:57,023
But when I came, alas, to wive

1005
02:15:57,191 --> 02:16:01,444
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain

1006
02:16:01,570 --> 02:16:05,907
By swaggering could I never thrive

1007
02:16:06,325 --> 02:16:10,286
For the rain it raineth every day

1008
02:16:11,330 --> 02:16:14,749
Emilie, you want
to speak with us afterwards?

1009
02:16:17,169 --> 02:16:18,836
What is it about?

1010
02:16:22,925 --> 02:16:26,261
But when I came unto my beds

1011
02:16:26,387 --> 02:16:30,640
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain

1012
02:16:30,766 --> 02:16:35,019
With tosspots still had drunken heads

1013
02:16:35,563 --> 02:16:40,233
For the rain it raineth every day

1014
02:16:41,694 --> 02:16:45,572
A great while ago the world begun

1015
02:16:45,739 --> 02:16:50,493
With hey, ho, the wind and the rain

1016
02:16:51,870 --> 02:16:57,125
But that's all one, our play is done

1017
02:16:58,002 --> 02:17:00,628
And we'll strive to please you every day

1018
02:17:11,849 --> 02:17:13,266
Well, that's that.

1019
02:17:14,602 --> 02:17:18,521
Better hurry up, you old ghost.

1020
02:17:19,106 --> 02:17:20,982
It's all a bunch of crap.

1021
02:18:43,649 --> 02:18:46,526
If you'd please sit down,
I'd like to talk to you.

1022
02:18:58,789 --> 02:19:01,040
My husband died a year ago today.

1023
02:19:01,959 --> 02:19:04,544
He wanted us to go on as usual,

1024
02:19:05,129 --> 02:19:06,963
and we have gone on as usual,

1025
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:10,216
though everything has been different.

1026
02:19:13,637 --> 02:19:17,265
We draw the theater over our heads
like a security blanket.

1027
02:19:18,267 --> 02:19:20,268
Our dressing rooms
are bright and warm.

1028
02:19:21,019 --> 02:19:23,938
The stage enfolds us
in friendly shadows.

1029
02:19:24,565 --> 02:19:27,900
Playwrights tell us
what to say and think.

1030
02:19:28,068 --> 02:19:30,570
We laugh, cry and rage.

1031
02:19:30,696 --> 02:19:33,740
People sit there in the dark,
kindly disposed towards us.

1032
02:19:33,907 --> 02:19:35,742
They're remarkably loyal,

1033
02:19:36,618 --> 02:19:39,287
though we often give them stones
instead of bread.

1034
02:19:39,413 --> 02:19:41,497
Most of the time
we're simply playing.

1035
02:19:42,750 --> 02:19:44,208
Almost always.

1036
02:19:44,752 --> 02:19:47,378
We play because we enjoy it.

1037
02:19:47,796 --> 02:19:51,466
And if we don't enjoy it,
we sulk and blame the circumstances...

1038
02:19:52,634 --> 02:19:54,177
never ourselves.

1039
02:19:58,390 --> 02:19:59,932
That's how it is.

1040
02:20:05,606 --> 02:20:08,983
So I pass my life
in wonderful self-deception,

1041
02:20:09,902 --> 02:20:14,238
with a keen eye for others' faults
while glossing over my own.

1042
02:20:15,115 --> 02:20:16,949
I don't know what I really am,

1043
02:20:17,493 --> 02:20:20,536
as I never cared
to find out the truth about myself.

1044
02:20:22,247 --> 02:20:23,873
But I do care about myself,

1045
02:20:23,999 --> 02:20:25,750
which is something different.

1046
02:20:28,962 --> 02:20:31,005
And I don't care
about reality, either.

1047
02:20:31,465 --> 02:20:33,382
It's drab and uninteresting.

1048
02:20:34,218 --> 02:20:35,802
It doesn't concern me,

1049
02:20:36,178 --> 02:20:40,473
unless, in one way or another,
it concerns the part I'm playing.

1050
02:20:43,811 --> 02:20:45,686
Are you tired of the theater?

1051
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:48,147
I think so.

1052
02:20:49,066 --> 02:20:52,443
- You want to quit?
- Perhaps, and for good.

1053
02:20:54,738 --> 02:20:56,697
What will happen to us if you quit?

1054
02:20:56,824 --> 02:20:59,992
Even if I quit,
everything will go on as before.

1055
02:21:00,494 --> 02:21:02,161
Who will be our manager?

1056
02:21:02,329 --> 02:21:05,122
We'II all decide that together
when the day comes,

1057
02:21:05,332 --> 02:21:06,916
if it comes.

1058
02:21:07,167 --> 02:21:09,085
I haven't yet made up my mind.

1059
02:21:09,753 --> 02:21:12,046
Now I suggest we say good night.

1060
02:21:12,172 --> 02:21:14,048
Good night.

1061
02:21:14,174 --> 02:21:15,925
Come, children. Let's change.

1062
02:21:23,767 --> 02:21:26,018
I need a drink and a sandwich.

1063
02:21:27,354 --> 02:21:28,980
Anyone care to join me?

1064
02:21:30,399 --> 02:21:32,692
I've received an offer
from the Lindberg troupe,

1065
02:21:32,860 --> 02:21:34,527
so it's all the same to me.

1066
02:21:38,156 --> 02:21:39,740
What did I tell you?

1067
02:21:43,579 --> 02:21:45,663
I think there's something behind this.

1068
02:21:46,039 --> 02:21:48,541
- Haven't you heard?
- You mean it's true?

1069
02:21:53,755 --> 02:21:55,298
Well, I'II be damned.

1070
02:22:32,336 --> 02:22:37,006
If music be the food of love, play on.

1071
02:22:37,966 --> 02:22:42,428
Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting -

1072
02:22:42,596 --> 02:22:45,306
Come, Alexander.
Stop fooling around.

1073
02:22:45,724 --> 02:22:46,974
Come on.

1074
02:23:34,314 --> 02:23:36,232
Good day, Alexander.

1075
02:23:36,525 --> 02:23:38,484
Please give my regards
to your mother.

1076
02:23:55,168 --> 02:23:57,837
- You're gonna be sorry.
- What do you mean?

1077
02:23:57,963 --> 02:24:00,089
You'll soon find out.

1078
02:24:11,518 --> 02:24:12,601
Hi.

1079
02:24:27,325 --> 02:24:28,743
What's wrong?

1080
02:24:52,392 --> 02:24:54,226
Someone wishes to talk to you.

1081
02:24:54,394 --> 02:24:56,228
The hot chocolate will have to wait.

1082
02:25:04,362 --> 02:25:06,405
- What have I done?
- You know quite well.

1083
02:25:20,629 --> 02:25:22,505
- Good day, Alexander.
- Good day.

1084
02:25:24,049 --> 02:25:26,050
We met once before.

1085
02:25:26,176 --> 02:25:29,220
Under sadder circumstances,
when I officiated at your father's funeral.

1086
02:25:30,972 --> 02:25:35,601
Since then, your mother has turned to me
with her worries, as is only natural.

1087
02:25:36,937 --> 02:25:39,772
I am a close friend
of your grandmother.

1088
02:25:40,857 --> 02:25:42,942
I'm the spiritual guide of the parish.

1089
02:25:43,110 --> 02:25:47,321
The bishop has been very good to me
during this difficult time.

1090
02:25:47,447 --> 02:25:50,533
We've also spoken of you, my son.

1091
02:25:50,659 --> 02:25:53,828
I've told the bishop how proud I am
of my well-behaved children.

1092
02:25:54,121 --> 02:25:56,705
You and your sister
are doing well at school, I'm told.

1093
02:25:56,832 --> 02:25:59,333
Diligent and attentive,
and earning good grades.

1094
02:25:59,626 --> 02:26:01,627
Isn't that so, Alexander?

1095
02:26:02,129 --> 02:26:05,172
Don't be afraid.
I'm your friend and wish you well.

1096
02:26:05,924 --> 02:26:07,466
You believe me, don't you?

1097
02:26:09,136 --> 02:26:12,972
But diligence and good grades
are not everything in this world.

1098
02:26:13,140 --> 02:26:14,682
Blow your nose, Alexander.

1099
02:26:20,147 --> 02:26:23,983
That's filthy!
Didn't Maj give you a clean handkerchief?

1100
02:26:24,484 --> 02:26:25,568
Yes.

1101
02:26:25,694 --> 02:26:27,027
Goddamn it all!

1102
02:26:31,324 --> 02:26:35,161
As I said, diligence and good grades
aren't everything in this world.

1103
02:26:35,287 --> 02:26:37,371
Listen to the bishop, Alexander.

1104
02:26:37,497 --> 02:26:39,081
I'm sure he is.

1105
02:26:40,500 --> 02:26:41,876
Isn't that so, Alexander?

1106
02:26:42,335 --> 02:26:44,753
You're anxious to know
what I'm going to say.

1107
02:26:46,464 --> 02:26:48,215
You're a big boy now.

1108
02:26:48,341 --> 02:26:51,886
So I'II talk to you man to man.

1109
02:26:54,681 --> 02:26:56,348
Can you tell me -

1110
02:26:56,933 --> 02:27:00,352
Can you explain to me

1111
02:27:01,146 --> 02:27:02,938
what a lie is

1112
02:27:03,356 --> 02:27:05,524
and what the truth is?

1113
02:27:10,614 --> 02:27:13,365
You think that was a stupid question,
and it probably was.

1114
02:27:13,533 --> 02:27:15,409
I was just kidding with you.

1115
02:27:15,535 --> 02:27:18,913
Of course you know what a lie is
and what the truth is, don't you?

1116
02:27:20,540 --> 02:27:21,707
Splendid.

1117
02:27:23,293 --> 02:27:24,668
Splendid, my boy.

1118
02:27:26,630 --> 02:27:30,090
You also know why one lies.

1119
02:27:33,220 --> 02:27:39,725
Why does one lie?

1120
02:27:40,060 --> 02:27:43,479
Can you explain to me why one lies?

1121
02:27:45,357 --> 02:27:47,233
Because you don't
want to tell the truth.

1122
02:27:51,947 --> 02:27:54,323
A very sly answer, my young friend.

1123
02:27:55,742 --> 02:27:58,535
But you won't get off so easily.

1124
02:27:58,787 --> 02:28:00,996
I asked you...

1125
02:28:04,251 --> 02:28:06,502
why does one not tell the truth?

1126
02:28:07,045 --> 02:28:08,462
I don't know.

1127
02:28:10,674 --> 02:28:12,549
We have plenty of time, Alexander,

1128
02:28:12,676 --> 02:28:14,760
and I'm so interested in your answer

1129
02:28:14,886 --> 02:28:16,845
that I'm prepared to wait indefinitely.

1130
02:28:18,556 --> 02:28:21,433
You may not believe that,
but it's true.

1131
02:28:23,353 --> 02:28:25,271
One lies to gain an advantage.

1132
02:28:25,772 --> 02:28:28,274
Good answer, my boy.

1133
02:28:29,067 --> 02:28:30,901
Good and concise.

1134
02:28:32,570 --> 02:28:36,365
Forgive me if I ask another question,
a bit more personal this time.

1135
02:28:38,868 --> 02:28:42,621
Can you explain to your mother and me
why you lied at school?

1136
02:28:42,998 --> 02:28:44,039
What?

1137
02:28:44,165 --> 02:28:47,668
Your teacher has written to me,

1138
02:28:47,794 --> 02:28:50,629
saying that you've been spreading
the most incredible lies.

1139
02:28:50,755 --> 02:28:51,839
Like what?

1140
02:28:51,965 --> 02:28:54,049
Sold to a circus!

1141
02:28:54,718 --> 02:28:57,803
Do you deny
that you told your classmates

1142
02:28:57,929 --> 02:29:01,515
that I sold you to a traveling circus,

1143
02:29:02,309 --> 02:29:04,852
and that at the end of the semester

1144
02:29:04,978 --> 02:29:07,438
they're coming to get you?

1145
02:29:08,273 --> 02:29:12,151
You are to train
as an acrobat and circus rider,

1146
02:29:12,277 --> 02:29:16,238
together with a gypsy
your age named Tamara.

1147
02:29:20,910 --> 02:29:24,455
Your mother was both terrified
and upset when she read the letter.

1148
02:29:25,790 --> 02:29:27,374
She didn't know what to do.

1149
02:29:28,793 --> 02:29:30,544
So I suggested I come over

1150
02:29:30,670 --> 02:29:32,755
and discuss these unpleasant
problems with you.

1151
02:29:35,175 --> 02:29:36,675
And here I am.

1152
02:29:36,801 --> 02:29:39,428
You should be grateful
to the bishop for taking the time.

1153
02:29:39,554 --> 02:29:41,180
Do you understand, Alexander?

1154
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:48,604
We've agreed that he who lies
does so to gain an advantage.

1155
02:29:50,065 --> 02:29:52,191
So I ask, quite logically,

1156
02:29:53,068 --> 02:29:57,237
what advantage did you gain by stating
your mother had sold you to a circus?

1157
02:29:58,531 --> 02:29:59,907
I don't know.

1158
02:30:01,368 --> 02:30:04,995
I think you do know...

1159
02:30:06,623 --> 02:30:08,540
but you're ashamed to answer.

1160
02:30:12,670 --> 02:30:14,880
You're ashamed, aren't you?

1161
02:30:15,757 --> 02:30:18,759
That's good, my son.
Very good.

1162
02:30:20,387 --> 02:30:22,971
It shows you'll be on your guard

1163
02:30:23,098 --> 02:30:25,099
against further fabrications
in the future.

1164
02:30:26,768 --> 02:30:30,062
Go to your mother
and ask her forgiveness

1165
02:30:30,188 --> 02:30:32,981
for all the sorrow and worry
you've caused her.

1166
02:30:36,152 --> 02:30:38,445
Go to your mother
and ask her to forgive you.

1167
02:30:42,409 --> 02:30:44,910
You hear what I say, don't you?

1168
02:30:51,835 --> 02:30:55,254
I ask Mother's forgiveness for lying,
and I promise never to do it again.

1169
02:30:55,880 --> 02:30:57,005
Good, Alexander.

1170
02:30:57,132 --> 02:30:59,800
The matter is resolved
and need never be mentioned again.

1171
02:31:01,428 --> 02:31:04,847
Imagination is a splendid thing,

1172
02:31:05,682 --> 02:31:07,766
a mighty force, a gift from God.

1173
02:31:11,187 --> 02:31:15,149
It's held in trust for us
by the great artists,

1174
02:31:15,650 --> 02:31:17,443
writers and musicians.

1175
02:31:27,287 --> 02:31:28,829
I'II get Fanny.

1176
02:31:46,473 --> 02:31:47,931
Come, Alexander.

1177
02:31:49,684 --> 02:31:51,643
I have something important
to tell you.

1178
02:31:54,564 --> 02:31:57,232
Edvard has asked if I will marry him.

1179
02:31:57,942 --> 02:32:00,694
I've accepted with gratitude and joy.

1180
02:32:01,446 --> 02:32:04,156
I've been alone for a long time,

1181
02:32:05,116 --> 02:32:08,160
and my children need a firm hand.

1182
02:32:08,578 --> 02:32:09,912
A father.

1183
02:32:12,332 --> 02:32:14,917
Of course, a great deal will be -

1184
02:32:21,007 --> 02:32:24,843
May God in his mercy
take care of our little family.

1185
02:32:27,764 --> 02:32:32,684
Let us kneel down
and unite in a heartfelt prayer.

1186
02:32:42,695 --> 02:32:47,783
May God our father in his mercy
take care of our little family

1187
02:32:48,618 --> 02:32:52,538
and bless us and keep us from evil
all the days of our life.

1188
02:32:55,083 --> 02:32:59,169
God give me strength

1189
02:33:00,088 --> 02:33:03,590
to be a guardian and a worthy example
to these little fatherless ones.

1190
02:33:05,385 --> 02:33:09,638
Give me strength as well
to be a support

1191
02:33:11,432 --> 02:33:13,725
to this Ionely young woman.

1192
02:33:23,027 --> 02:33:25,404
In the 15th century,
when this house was built,

1193
02:33:25,530 --> 02:33:27,781
they didn't bother much about comfort.

1194
02:33:29,409 --> 02:33:34,037
My predecessors kept it all as it was,
and I follow the tradition.

1195
02:33:36,165 --> 02:33:39,960
These old rooms have
an imperishable beauty.

1196
02:33:42,088 --> 02:33:46,883
We should be grateful that we may live
in an atmosphere of purity and austerity.

1197
02:33:47,510 --> 02:33:50,137
Ah, here come my mother and sister.

1198
02:33:50,263 --> 02:33:51,847
You're already here.

1199
02:33:52,974 --> 02:33:55,142
Welcome, Mrs. Ekdahl.

1200
02:33:55,435 --> 02:33:56,310
Thank you.

1201
02:33:57,103 --> 02:33:59,271
This is my sister Henrietta.

1202
02:33:59,939 --> 02:34:02,691
- Welcome to the bishop's palace.
- Thank you.

1203
02:34:04,193 --> 02:34:06,111
Come and say hello, children.

1204
02:34:11,075 --> 02:34:14,119
This is Mrs. Tander,
our capable cook,

1205
02:34:14,287 --> 02:34:16,371
who's been with our family
for 30 years.

1206
02:34:16,497 --> 02:34:19,583
This is my future wife,
Mrs. Emilie Ekdahl.

1207
02:34:19,709 --> 02:34:22,294
Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl. Welcome.

1208
02:34:23,296 --> 02:34:28,467
These are our capable helpers:
Karna, Selma and little Justina.

1209
02:34:28,968 --> 02:34:32,220
Now we'll go see my aunt,
who, alas, is sick and bedridden.

1210
02:34:56,996 --> 02:34:59,164
How are you today, Aunt Elsa?

1211
02:35:00,458 --> 02:35:03,001
We have a visitor.

1212
02:35:03,127 --> 02:35:05,170
Don't be afraid, children.
Come and say hello.

1213
02:35:05,296 --> 02:35:10,175
My future wife, Mrs. Emilie Ekdahl,
the famous actress.

1214
02:35:11,511 --> 02:35:12,844
Hello, Miss Bergius.

1215
02:35:49,424 --> 02:35:51,466
The children have fallen asleep.

1216
02:35:51,592 --> 02:35:53,343
It's late and we must go home.

1217
02:35:53,469 --> 02:35:56,221
- Not yet.
- What is it, Edvard?

1218
02:35:56,848 --> 02:35:58,724
I have a wish.

1219
02:35:59,475 --> 02:36:01,393
A single wish, but an important one.

1220
02:36:01,519 --> 02:36:05,355
You may change your mind
if you find it impossible.

1221
02:36:05,481 --> 02:36:07,065
Tell me your wish.

1222
02:36:07,734 --> 02:36:11,903
I want you to come to my house
without possessions.

1223
02:36:13,072 --> 02:36:14,656
What do you mean?

1224
02:36:18,453 --> 02:36:20,412
I want you to leave your home...

1225
02:36:22,206 --> 02:36:25,584
your clothes, jewels, furniture...

1226
02:36:26,919 --> 02:36:28,170
your valuables...

1227
02:36:29,589 --> 02:36:32,841
your friends, habits and thoughts.

1228
02:36:34,761 --> 02:36:37,763
I want you to leave
your former life entirely.

1229
02:36:39,474 --> 02:36:41,266
Am I to come naked?

1230
02:36:42,435 --> 02:36:44,227
I'm serious, my dear.

1231
02:36:45,062 --> 02:36:48,273
I want you to come
to your new life as if newly born.

1232
02:36:48,900 --> 02:36:50,650
- And the children?
- The children also.

1233
02:36:50,777 --> 02:36:54,279
- Their toys, dolls, books -
- Nothing.

1234
02:36:58,367 --> 02:37:01,119
- I must talk to them.
- It's your decision.

1235
02:37:01,245 --> 02:37:04,331
I can decide for myself,
but not for the children.

1236
02:37:05,458 --> 02:37:06,958
I must ask them.

1237
02:37:07,126 --> 02:37:09,461
They must sacrifice something
for their mother's happiness.

1238
02:37:09,629 --> 02:37:11,463
You're angry.

1239
02:37:13,007 --> 02:37:14,382
Kiss me.

1240
02:37:22,016 --> 02:37:23,975
I'm not angry, not in the least.

1241
02:37:24,143 --> 02:37:25,644
I'll win them over.

1242
02:37:25,895 --> 02:37:28,313
Think it over, Emilie.

1243
02:37:29,565 --> 02:37:31,608
I've already thought it over.

1244
02:37:32,777 --> 02:37:35,695
For me it's not hard
to grant your wish.

1245
02:37:37,990 --> 02:37:40,575
I've never cared for anything
very seriously.

1246
02:37:42,370 --> 02:37:44,079
I've sometimes wondered

1247
02:37:44,330 --> 02:37:47,499
if there wasn't something
very wrong with my feelings.

1248
02:37:48,835 --> 02:37:51,670
I couldn't understand
why nothing really hurt...

1249
02:37:52,839 --> 02:37:55,173
why I never felt really happy.

1250
02:37:58,010 --> 02:38:00,470
I know now that
the crucial moment has come.

1251
02:38:02,306 --> 02:38:05,809
I know that we'll hurt each other,

1252
02:38:06,227 --> 02:38:08,311
but I'm not afraid.

1253
02:38:08,521 --> 02:38:11,147
I also know that we will
make each other happy.

1254
02:38:12,191 --> 02:38:16,194
And I sometimes weep from fear,
because time is so short,

1255
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:19,030
the days pass so quickly,
and nothing lasts forever.

1256
02:38:20,324 --> 02:38:22,784
You say your God is the God of love.

1257
02:38:24,328 --> 02:38:25,996
It sounds so beautiful...

1258
02:38:28,374 --> 02:38:30,834
and I wish I could believe as you do.

1259
02:38:32,753 --> 02:38:34,629
Perhaps one day I will.

1260
02:38:37,049 --> 02:38:39,217
My God is so different, Edvard.

1261
02:38:40,553 --> 02:38:42,053
He's like myself,

1262
02:38:43,264 --> 02:38:46,600
amorphous and intangible.

1263
02:38:48,144 --> 02:38:52,272
I'm an actress.
I'm used to wearing masks.

1264
02:38:54,150 --> 02:38:56,359
My God wears a thousand masks.

1265
02:38:57,403 --> 02:38:59,988
He's never shown me his real face,

1266
02:39:00,990 --> 02:39:04,284
just as I can't show
you or him my real face.

1267
02:39:08,039 --> 02:39:12,918
Through you I'II come to know
God's true nature.

1268
02:39:14,420 --> 02:39:16,087
Kiss me, now,

1269
02:39:16,213 --> 02:39:19,424
and hold me in your arms,
as only you can.

1270
02:39:26,766 --> 02:39:30,602
I, Olof Henrik Edvard Vergérus...

1271
02:39:35,650 --> 02:39:40,111
take thee,
Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

1272
02:39:45,076 --> 02:39:47,619
to be my wedded wife...

1273
02:39:51,290 --> 02:39:54,125
to love you for better and for worse...

1274
02:39:58,255 --> 02:40:02,801
and as a symbol of this love
I give you this ring.

1275
02:40:11,852 --> 02:40:16,356
I, Elisabet Emilie Josefin Ekdahl...

1276
02:40:20,653 --> 02:40:24,823
take thee,
Olof Henrik Edvard Vergérus,

1277
02:40:28,869 --> 02:40:31,454
to be my wedded husband...

1278
02:40:33,958 --> 02:40:36,835
to love you for better and for worse...

1279
02:40:39,880 --> 02:40:43,883
and as a symbol of this love
I take this ring.

1280
02:40:52,393 --> 02:40:58,398
In the name of God the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost.

1281
02:40:58,524 --> 02:41:00,150
Amen.

1282
02:41:02,695 --> 02:41:06,865
For as much as you have consented
in holy wedlock

1283
02:41:07,116 --> 02:41:13,913
and have witnessed the same
before God and this Christian gathering,

1284
02:41:15,541 --> 02:41:21,212
I hereby confirm, as Christ's servant,

1285
02:41:21,338 --> 02:41:24,090
this holy union.

1286
02:41:30,306 --> 02:41:32,348
I wonder if this is a good thing.

1287
02:41:32,641 --> 02:41:35,518
You saw how happy she was.

1288
02:41:35,936 --> 02:41:39,230
- I'm thinking of the children.
- They'II get used to it, dear Mama.

1289
02:41:42,735 --> 02:41:45,904
He's a devil of a lady killer,
the bishop is.

1290
02:41:46,072 --> 02:41:48,073
You don't know that for sure, Carl.

1291
02:41:49,241 --> 02:41:51,910
I don't know
why I just want to cry.

1292
02:41:52,244 --> 02:41:55,288
They should have taken a honeymoon.

1293
02:41:55,414 --> 02:41:59,292
I invited them to our house in Provence,
but Emilie refused.

1294
02:41:59,418 --> 02:42:01,419
That's not so strange.

1295
02:42:01,545 --> 02:42:04,005
She has great respect
for her new husband.

1296
02:42:04,757 --> 02:42:07,425
He's a handsome man,
whatever you say.

1297
02:42:07,593 --> 02:42:11,346
- I expect he has false teeth.
- Petra, don't be silly.

1298
02:42:11,764 --> 02:42:14,224
His mother was nice.

1299
02:42:14,475 --> 02:42:16,935
They say the sister's a bitch.

1300
02:42:17,061 --> 02:42:20,271
I've a feeling we'll have Emilie back...

1301
02:42:22,108 --> 02:42:23,942
quite soon.

1302
02:42:24,944 --> 02:42:27,904
CLOSED

1303
02:43:43,063 --> 02:43:45,607
The children don't appear
to have an appetite.

1304
02:43:45,983 --> 02:43:49,861
Everything's new and strange to them.
You must understand, Henrietta.

1305
02:43:50,029 --> 02:43:53,573
Perhaps they're turning up
their noses at the food.

1306
02:43:55,743 --> 02:43:58,244
Let's be happy
on our first evening together.

1307
02:43:59,288 --> 02:44:01,664
I have no desire to spoil it,

1308
02:44:02,374 --> 02:44:05,251
but in the future -

1309
02:44:06,128 --> 02:44:08,796
Yes, I might as well mention it now.

1310
02:44:09,298 --> 02:44:12,383
In the future no one may leave the table
without having eaten up -

1311
02:44:12,509 --> 02:44:16,888
Dearest Henrietta,
I'll tell my children what to do.

1312
02:44:17,056 --> 02:44:21,392
There's a basic rule in this house
which no one must break,

1313
02:44:21,810 --> 02:44:24,020
not even you, dear Emilie,

1314
02:44:24,647 --> 02:44:28,066
and that is respect
for the temporal gifts.

1315
02:44:28,234 --> 02:44:31,486
I think you've misunderstood
an essential point, dearest Henrietta.

1316
02:44:32,738 --> 02:44:36,032
But I suggest we postpone this discussion
to a more suitable time.

1317
02:44:36,158 --> 02:44:39,744
Forgive me, dear Emilie.
I am forgetting myself.

1318
02:44:40,079 --> 02:44:42,538
I'm sure you're a more capable
housewife than I.

1319
02:44:42,831 --> 02:44:44,958
I'll ask your advice in all things.

1320
02:44:45,334 --> 02:44:48,169
Edvard has admonished me
a hundred times.

1321
02:44:49,588 --> 02:44:52,423
It's not easy to realize

1322
02:44:52,591 --> 02:44:55,510
one has become superfluous!

1323
02:44:55,636 --> 02:44:56,803
That will do, Henrietta.

1324
02:45:22,329 --> 02:45:24,497
Perhaps I may be allowed to share

1325
02:45:24,790 --> 02:45:28,918
that we are early risers in this house,
both weekdays and Sundays.

1326
02:45:29,586 --> 02:45:32,839
At 6:00 we gather
for morning prayers in Edvard's study.

1327
02:45:34,466 --> 02:45:37,635
I'd also like to mention that we make
our own beds and tidy our rooms.

1328
02:45:38,721 --> 02:45:42,432
In this house, punctuality,
cleanliness and order are the rule.

1329
02:45:43,309 --> 02:45:44,976
Don't be alarmed, children.

1330
02:45:45,144 --> 02:45:47,854
My daughter makes it sound
worse than it actually is.

1331
02:45:48,147 --> 02:45:49,897
We'II start out very gently.

1332
02:45:50,024 --> 02:45:52,358
I'm not sure I understand.

1333
02:45:52,609 --> 02:45:55,236
If you mean to apply
a new method of upbringing -

1334
02:45:55,362 --> 02:45:58,156
Not at all, dear Emilie.

1335
02:45:58,657 --> 02:46:02,076
I'm convinced that the children
will soon realize

1336
02:46:02,202 --> 02:46:05,163
how fun it is to perform
one's duties conscientiously.

1337
02:46:05,622 --> 02:46:08,416
It's all to be like a game.

1338
02:46:08,542 --> 02:46:12,086
My children don't care
for that sort of game,

1339
02:46:12,212 --> 02:46:13,504
and neither do I.

1340
02:46:13,630 --> 02:46:15,548
Time will tell, dear Emilie.

1341
02:46:20,721 --> 02:46:23,389
Let us bring our hands together
and thank God for this meal.

1342
02:46:25,517 --> 02:46:29,020
Thank you, dear Lord,
for what we have received,

1343
02:46:29,146 --> 02:46:31,939
and may we with generous hearts
share our abundance

1344
02:46:32,066 --> 02:46:34,108
with those who hunger
and thirst. Amen.

1345
02:46:35,861 --> 02:46:38,488
Justina, please show
Fanny and Alexander to the nursery.

1346
02:46:39,323 --> 02:46:43,326
It's late and high time
for young people to go to rest.

1347
02:47:05,224 --> 02:47:09,268
They're coming now.
Into bed, both of you!

1348
02:47:16,819 --> 02:47:18,611
Now we'II say our prayers.

1349
02:47:23,158 --> 02:47:26,077
Thank you, God, for this day.
Please make me good.

1350
02:47:26,245 --> 02:47:27,995
May your angel stay by me
through the night.

1351
02:47:28,122 --> 02:47:30,123
God bless Papa and Mama
and Grandpapa and Grand -

1352
02:47:30,249 --> 02:47:31,749
And Uncle Edvard.

1353
02:47:32,793 --> 02:47:34,085
And Uncle Edvard,

1354
02:47:34,294 --> 02:47:36,963
myself and my brothers and sisters
and cousins, uncles and aunts,

1355
02:47:37,089 --> 02:47:40,174
Vega, Ester, Maj,
Siri, Berta, Alida, Lisen,

1356
02:47:40,300 --> 02:47:42,552
and Uncle Isak
and everybody else. Amen.

1357
02:47:46,265 --> 02:47:47,723
Good night, Alexander.

1358
02:47:48,392 --> 02:47:51,811
Justina, I'd like to speak to you
about tomorrow.

1359
02:48:01,155 --> 02:48:20,798
What's that book you're reading,
Alexander?

1360
02:48:29,433 --> 02:48:31,392
Good night, my boy.

1361
02:48:47,659 --> 02:48:49,619
Good night, my child.
God bless you.

1362
02:48:50,579 --> 02:48:52,121
Good night, Uncle Edvard.

1363
02:48:59,755 --> 02:49:02,924
My dearest wish is for us to live
at peace with one another.

1364
02:49:07,179 --> 02:49:09,180
Love cannot be commanded,

1365
02:49:10,682 --> 02:49:13,017
but we can show respect
and consideration.

1366
02:49:18,273 --> 02:49:20,316
You go ahead, my dear.
I'll come later.

1367
02:49:30,536 --> 02:49:32,161
Whose dollhouse is this?

1368
02:49:32,955 --> 02:49:36,040
Fifteen years ago,
two little girls lived in this room.

1369
02:49:36,708 --> 02:49:39,418
They drowned in the river
with their mother.

1370
02:49:40,212 --> 02:49:44,423
- Perhaps the house is haunted.
- There are no such things as ghosts.

1371
02:49:46,552 --> 02:49:49,637
- Did they live in this room?
- I think this was the nursery.

1372
02:49:49,930 --> 02:49:51,681
Good night. Sleep well.

1373
02:49:52,099 --> 02:49:54,475
I think we've got
a terrible stepfather.

1374
02:49:54,601 --> 02:49:56,894
And the sister is crazy.

1375
02:49:57,020 --> 02:49:59,939
And that tub of lard
that has to be fed.

1376
02:50:00,065 --> 02:50:01,440
I don't want to live here.

1377
02:50:12,578 --> 02:50:14,745
You have to give me time.

1378
02:50:15,414 --> 02:50:17,248
Much has to be changed.

1379
02:50:18,083 --> 02:50:21,502
Some things will go quickly,
others will take time.

1380
02:50:22,421 --> 02:50:24,755
The main thing is not to lose heart.

1381
02:50:25,090 --> 02:50:27,383
Why did you marry the bishop?

1382
02:50:27,759 --> 02:50:31,387
Because I love him.

1383
02:50:32,222 --> 02:50:36,934
Now let us sleep. Things will seem
better when we're not so tired.

1384
02:50:43,191 --> 02:50:45,610
Don't play Hamlet, my son.

1385
02:50:46,153 --> 02:50:47,945
I'm not Queen Gertrude,

1386
02:50:48,113 --> 02:50:50,489
your kind stepfather
isn't the King of Denmark,

1387
02:50:50,741 --> 02:50:52,575
and this is not Elsinore Castle,

1388
02:50:52,951 --> 02:50:55,328
even if it does look rather gloomy.

1389
02:51:06,340 --> 02:51:08,633
Hell and damnation.

1390
02:51:12,638 --> 02:51:14,430
Come, Fanny.
I'll show you something.

1391
02:51:25,984 --> 02:51:27,985
The windows are barred.

1392
02:51:28,820 --> 02:51:30,404
They can't be opened.

1393
02:54:57,946 --> 02:55:01,073
THE FOURTH ACT

1394
02:55:02,158 --> 02:55:07,121
EVENTS OF SUMMER

1395
02:56:20,403 --> 02:56:23,197
Is that you, old Isak?

1396
02:56:23,615 --> 02:56:25,324
How nice of you to call.

1397
02:56:26,284 --> 02:56:29,745
No, you're not disturbing me.
I was just sitting with my eyes closed.

1398
02:56:31,247 --> 02:56:33,874
Sleeping? You know I never sleep.

1399
02:56:36,044 --> 02:56:38,003
Everyone's abandoned me.

1400
02:56:38,171 --> 02:56:41,006
It's the annual excursion
to the outer cliffs.

1401
02:56:41,716 --> 02:56:45,427
Gustav Adolf doesn't change plans,
even if it's raining cats and dogs.

1402
02:56:46,888 --> 02:56:50,391
When they left at 10:00,
the weather was fine,

1403
02:56:50,558 --> 02:56:52,935
but clouds have gathered
over the mainland.

1404
02:56:54,062 --> 02:56:55,980
There's not a soul here.

1405
02:56:57,649 --> 02:57:01,068
Won't you come out here for once?

1406
02:57:02,612 --> 02:57:04,989
Come now, don't be so stubborn.

1407
02:57:05,407 --> 02:57:07,992
You can't sit in your awful shop
the whole summer.

1408
02:57:09,911 --> 02:57:11,662
You want me to come to you?

1409
02:57:11,788 --> 02:57:15,749
I've sat here three days
with a sprained ankle.

1410
02:57:16,835 --> 02:57:20,004
I was playing hopscotch with Jenny,
so I've only myself to blame.

1411
02:57:20,588 --> 02:57:22,756
I'm not complaining.
I'm very comfortable.

1412
02:57:24,509 --> 02:57:26,135
What did you say?

1413
02:57:26,261 --> 02:57:29,179
There's such static on the line,
I can't hear what you're saying.

1414
02:57:29,764 --> 02:57:33,559
It's thundering somewhere,
but it doesn't seem to be coming this way.

1415
02:57:35,854 --> 02:57:39,023
Yes, exactly, my friend.

1416
02:57:40,108 --> 02:57:43,444
Actually I'm very worried.

1417
02:57:45,238 --> 02:57:47,197
No, we haven't heard anything.

1418
02:57:47,323 --> 02:57:50,451
Emilie only told us she'd be staying
in town all summer.

1419
02:57:51,995 --> 02:57:54,163
This isn't good, Isak.

1420
02:57:54,289 --> 02:57:57,791
I feel sick when I think
of that big house with its thick walls.

1421
02:57:57,959 --> 02:57:59,960
It's no place for children
in the summer.

1422
02:58:02,547 --> 02:58:05,174
I can't hear a word you're saying.

1423
02:58:11,139 --> 02:58:12,890
It's hopeless.

1424
02:58:13,683 --> 02:58:18,270
Isak, can you hear me?
You sound very far away.

1425
02:58:19,314 --> 02:58:23,567
I'm going to hang up now.
I'll call you back in an hour.

1426
02:58:35,663 --> 02:58:38,832
I wonder if it isn't time
for a little cognac.

1427
02:58:39,542 --> 02:58:41,085
Yes, I think it is.

1428
02:58:42,378 --> 02:58:45,714
- Good day, Mrs. Ekdahl.
- Why, it's Maj! How nice.

1429
02:58:46,049 --> 02:58:47,382
Come in, dear child.

1430
02:58:52,180 --> 02:58:53,597
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

1431
02:58:53,848 --> 02:58:56,892
Not at all.
Give me a kiss.

1432
02:58:57,852 --> 02:58:59,478
That's nice.

1433
02:59:00,688 --> 02:59:03,857
Very pretty.
Did you make it yourself?

1434
02:59:03,983 --> 02:59:05,192
Yes.

1435
02:59:05,527 --> 02:59:07,402
A pretty pattern.

1436
02:59:08,780 --> 02:59:10,447
So you didn't go on the excursion?

1437
02:59:10,573 --> 02:59:12,825
No, I wouldn't fit in the boat
with my big belly.

1438
02:59:12,951 --> 02:59:14,701
Nonsense.

1439
02:59:16,079 --> 02:59:19,373
Is something wrong?
- I'm silly to worry.

1440
02:59:19,874 --> 02:59:21,667
Let's sit here.

1441
02:59:24,629 --> 02:59:26,213
You're worried about the children?

1442
02:59:28,133 --> 02:59:30,968
Alexander and I agreed to write.

1443
02:59:31,386 --> 02:59:33,178
I've written seven letters.

1444
02:59:33,596 --> 02:59:35,222
And you've received no reply?

1445
02:59:35,390 --> 02:59:37,391
One postcard three weeks ago.

1446
02:59:39,060 --> 02:59:41,228
"Dear Maj. We are well.

1447
02:59:41,604 --> 02:59:45,315
Uncle Edvard took us to..."

1448
02:59:45,441 --> 02:59:46,900
The botanical gardens.

1449
02:59:47,026 --> 02:59:52,489
"We learned about rare flowers."

1450
02:59:53,741 --> 02:59:57,494
"Thank you for your letters.
I'll write when I get some time.

1451
02:59:58,037 --> 03:00:00,497
Love from Alexander.

1452
03:00:01,082 --> 03:00:02,749
Fanny sends her love."

1453
03:00:11,843 --> 03:00:13,635
We mustn't underestimate Emilie.

1454
03:00:13,887 --> 03:00:16,513
She's perfectly capable
of looking after her children.

1455
03:00:17,390 --> 03:00:19,850
We're worrying for no reason.

1456
03:00:20,393 --> 03:00:22,477
I came to the family
before Fanny was born.

1457
03:00:22,604 --> 03:00:24,229
They're my children too.

1458
03:00:24,355 --> 03:00:25,689
You're going already?

1459
03:00:25,815 --> 03:00:29,276
I wanted to speak with you,
since I knew you were alone.

1460
03:00:29,402 --> 03:00:30,986
Stay a moment.

1461
03:00:31,112 --> 03:00:33,447
Thank you for your kindness,

1462
03:00:33,573 --> 03:00:36,283
but I promised to have dinner ready
when they came home.

1463
03:00:36,701 --> 03:00:39,036
I haven't put the steak
in the oven yet.

1464
03:00:39,162 --> 03:00:42,664
Dear child, are things that bad?

1465
03:00:43,249 --> 03:00:44,458
Yes.

1466
03:00:45,126 --> 03:00:48,295
- Is it the café?
- That too.

1467
03:00:49,297 --> 03:00:51,673
Has Gustav Adolf been pestering you?

1468
03:00:52,634 --> 03:00:54,843
I don't want to hurt him.
He's so kind.

1469
03:00:57,096 --> 03:00:59,514
What worries me most
is the children.

1470
03:01:03,436 --> 03:01:07,147
I'm sorry to be crying.
I'm behaving badly.

1471
03:01:07,899 --> 03:01:09,900
Forgive me.

1472
03:01:31,256 --> 03:01:32,547
Supper time.

1473
03:01:42,475 --> 03:01:44,518
Then you are to go straight to bed.

1474
03:01:46,562 --> 03:01:48,438
The tray can be left until tomorrow.

1475
03:01:51,901 --> 03:01:54,194
Mrs. Tander sent some cookies for you.

1476
03:01:54,821 --> 03:01:58,865
I'II be upset if Miss Vergérus
finds out I gave these to you.

1477
03:01:58,992 --> 03:02:00,575
Hasn't Mother returned?

1478
03:02:00,702 --> 03:02:03,704
No, your mother has not returned.

1479
03:02:03,830 --> 03:02:05,831
She said she'd be back this evening.

1480
03:02:06,457 --> 03:02:09,418
Oh, dear, I don't know what to say.

1481
03:02:09,794 --> 03:02:11,920
Why do you keep sighing like that?

1482
03:02:14,048 --> 03:02:16,383
I haven't been in this house long,
thank goodness...

1483
03:02:18,052 --> 03:02:21,346
but Mrs. Tander,
who's been here since the first wife,

1484
03:02:21,472 --> 03:02:23,348
could tell you a thing or two.

1485
03:02:24,225 --> 03:02:26,143
Would you like a cookie?

1486
03:02:29,314 --> 03:02:31,732
- Yes, thank you.
- What does Mrs. Tander say?

1487
03:02:32,525 --> 03:02:35,902
That it was the same
in the first wife's day.

1488
03:02:38,031 --> 03:02:39,239
Only worse.

1489
03:02:43,703 --> 03:02:45,996
Poor children.
- You mean us?

1490
03:02:47,206 --> 03:02:49,791
No, I don't mean you.

1491
03:02:51,377 --> 03:02:55,839
I mean the poor little ones who found
their grave in the dark river outside.

1492
03:02:57,759 --> 03:02:59,509
Their mother tried to save them,

1493
03:02:59,927 --> 03:03:01,970
but she was pulled down
by the current.

1494
03:03:03,556 --> 03:03:05,932
They found them later by the bridge.

1495
03:03:08,603 --> 03:03:10,771
They clung tightly to each other

1496
03:03:10,897 --> 03:03:13,815
as if they were one big body.

1497
03:03:17,195 --> 03:03:20,906
The arms had to be sawn off
to get the bodies into separate coffins.

1498
03:03:22,450 --> 03:03:26,286
Mrs. Tander says that since then,
it has never been quiet in this house.

1499
03:03:26,621 --> 03:03:28,455
There are no ghosts.

1500
03:03:28,748 --> 03:03:31,625
I don't mean to frighten you...

1501
03:03:33,878 --> 03:03:37,005
but this house
does funny things to you.

1502
03:03:37,673 --> 03:03:39,132
Look at my hand.

1503
03:03:39,592 --> 03:03:43,637
Skin's been completely ripped off,
stripped down to the flesh.

1504
03:03:47,100 --> 03:03:49,518
I was taking His Grace his coffee.

1505
03:03:50,645 --> 03:03:53,647
When I grabbed the doorknob,
the skin stuck and ripped off.

1506
03:03:56,234 --> 03:03:58,819
Someone laughed behind me.

1507
03:03:59,821 --> 03:04:02,364
I heard it clearly and turned around.

1508
03:04:05,785 --> 03:04:08,328
But there was no one there.

1509
03:04:10,832 --> 03:04:12,749
I feel sorry for anyone who -

1510
03:04:14,168 --> 03:04:16,503
I shouldn't chatter on like this.

1511
03:04:17,046 --> 03:04:18,588
I'll keep quiet.

1512
03:04:20,174 --> 03:04:21,758
I'll close the door now.

1513
03:04:28,182 --> 03:04:29,850
Don't worry.

1514
03:04:30,810 --> 03:04:32,727
Your mother will probably
be back tomorrow,

1515
03:04:32,854 --> 03:04:37,691
and His Grace will personally
release you from captivity.

1516
03:04:39,735 --> 03:04:42,487
- I've seen them.
- Who?

1517
03:04:43,114 --> 03:04:44,656
The woman and the children.

1518
03:04:45,700 --> 03:04:47,242
Is that the truth?

1519
03:04:47,952 --> 03:04:50,245
Are you telling the truth, Alexander?

1520
03:04:50,371 --> 03:04:52,706
Word of honor as a Swedish citizen.

1521
03:04:52,832 --> 03:04:54,583
Where did you see them?

1522
03:04:54,876 --> 03:04:58,712
I had been in the library
with that man who married my mother.

1523
03:04:58,838 --> 03:05:00,714
He'd been lecturing me.

1524
03:05:01,841 --> 03:05:03,842
I don't remember why.

1525
03:05:05,386 --> 03:05:07,512
I was passing through
the dining room...

1526
03:05:08,681 --> 03:05:11,183
and it was unusually bright.

1527
03:05:12,101 --> 03:05:15,479
Then I saw a little girl
in the doorway.

1528
03:05:15,813 --> 03:05:19,316
She ran past me without a sound.

1529
03:05:21,194 --> 03:05:23,904
Then I saw the older girl,

1530
03:05:24,030 --> 03:05:27,157
with the dark hair and big eyes.

1531
03:05:29,744 --> 03:05:32,204
She stopped and looked at me

1532
03:05:32,330 --> 03:05:36,249
and motioned to me to turn around.

1533
03:05:38,920 --> 03:05:43,673
And there in the bright sunlight...

1534
03:05:44,884 --> 03:05:49,387
stood the woman in her black dress.

1535
03:05:52,600 --> 03:05:56,728
She said in a faint,
almost inaudible voice...

1536
03:05:58,689 --> 03:06:00,315
not to be afraid,

1537
03:06:00,691 --> 03:06:02,484
that she had something to tell me.

1538
03:06:03,528 --> 03:06:04,945
What did she say?

1539
03:06:05,112 --> 03:06:07,113
I don't want to frighten anyone,

1540
03:06:08,032 --> 03:06:10,575
but these were her very words:

1541
03:06:13,496 --> 03:06:16,540
"I want you to know our secret.

1542
03:06:18,918 --> 03:06:22,379
Your stepfather, my husband,

1543
03:06:23,422 --> 03:06:26,925
locked me and my children
in the bedchamber.

1544
03:06:29,387 --> 03:06:33,390
For five days and nights

1545
03:06:34,016 --> 03:06:36,476
he kept us without food and water.

1546
03:06:38,813 --> 03:06:41,815
In our misery

1547
03:06:41,983 --> 03:06:43,567
we decided to escape.

1548
03:06:44,318 --> 03:06:49,155
We tied sheets together
and tried to climb down

1549
03:06:49,615 --> 03:06:54,244
to the finger of land sticking out
into the deep, swirling water.

1550
03:06:56,247 --> 03:06:58,665
My daughters went first,

1551
03:06:59,166 --> 03:07:02,294
but they fell headfirst into the water

1552
03:07:02,670 --> 03:07:04,879
and were dragged under.

1553
03:07:06,716 --> 03:07:08,466
I tried to save them

1554
03:07:08,843 --> 03:07:13,763
but was sucked down into a black whirlpool
that grabbed my clothes.

1555
03:07:15,766 --> 03:07:19,603
Underwater I grasped
my children's hands

1556
03:07:20,396 --> 03:07:22,856
and drew them to me."

1557
03:07:23,774 --> 03:07:25,191
That's devilish.

1558
03:07:27,069 --> 03:07:28,194
Get to bed.

1559
03:07:29,864 --> 03:07:31,406
I said get to bed.

1560
03:07:32,658 --> 03:07:34,075
What time is it?

1561
03:07:34,201 --> 03:07:36,244
His Grace has forbidden me
to speak to you.

1562
03:07:37,330 --> 03:07:40,081
I'll be angry
if you don't keep quiet.

1563
03:07:42,918 --> 03:07:45,378
Him and his stories!

1564
03:07:48,883 --> 03:07:50,383
Did you see that?

1565
03:07:53,929 --> 03:07:56,890
The lightning struck.
- It was nearby.

1566
03:07:57,642 --> 03:07:59,809
I hope the damn cathedral
went to hell.

1567
03:07:59,935 --> 03:08:02,979
What if God punishes you
for saying that?

1568
03:08:03,230 --> 03:08:07,400
If a big know-it-all like him
punishes a runt like me for so little,

1569
03:08:07,943 --> 03:08:10,779
then he's just the dirty bastard
I suspect he is.

1570
03:08:11,864 --> 03:08:14,157
Listen, he's playing the flute.

1571
03:08:14,950 --> 03:08:19,579
If we concentrate on him dying,
then he will.

1572
03:08:19,705 --> 03:08:21,706
But we have to start together.

1573
03:08:23,084 --> 03:08:25,251
One, two, three:

1574
03:08:25,461 --> 03:08:27,587
Die, you devil!

1575
03:08:31,217 --> 03:08:34,260
- He's still playing.
- Let's try again.

1576
03:08:35,596 --> 03:08:37,514
One, two, three:

1577
03:08:38,224 --> 03:08:40,600
Die, you devil!

1578
03:08:59,036 --> 03:09:04,791
Mrs. Tander wants to know
if Your Grace will have supper alone.

1579
03:09:05,626 --> 03:09:08,086
Tell her I don't want any supper.

1580
03:09:08,212 --> 03:09:10,964
A glass of milk and a sandwich
in my room will be sufficient.

1581
03:09:11,132 --> 03:09:13,299
Thank you, sir. I'll tell her.

1582
03:09:16,846 --> 03:09:18,304
Was there something else?

1583
03:09:19,640 --> 03:09:21,099
I don't know.

1584
03:09:23,644 --> 03:09:27,355
I don't know how to say it.
It's so unpleasant. It might seem -

1585
03:09:27,481 --> 03:09:28,857
Well?

1586
03:09:29,483 --> 03:09:31,651
Sir, I can't stand here
in the doorway.

1587
03:09:33,279 --> 03:09:34,988
Come in, then, and close the door.

1588
03:09:39,702 --> 03:09:42,537
You said I was to keep an eye
on the children,

1589
03:09:43,330 --> 03:09:47,625
listen to their conversation
and tell you of anything unusual.

1590
03:09:47,752 --> 03:09:48,960
Well?

1591
03:09:50,421 --> 03:09:53,089
Alexander made up a terrible story.

1592
03:09:53,382 --> 03:09:54,591
Really?

1593
03:09:55,176 --> 03:09:56,634
It was about -

1594
03:09:57,845 --> 03:10:00,847
Oh, it's so awful
I don't know how to get it out.

1595
03:10:04,268 --> 03:10:08,229
He says you locked
your first wife up,

1596
03:10:08,355 --> 03:10:12,609
and she was drowned with her children
when they tried to escape.

1597
03:10:23,579 --> 03:10:27,040
- That's all, sir.
- You can go.

1598
03:12:19,111 --> 03:12:23,197
Yes, Oscar, that's how it is.

1599
03:12:23,866 --> 03:12:27,243
One is old and a child
at the same time.

1600
03:12:29,747 --> 03:12:33,750
What became
of those long years in between

1601
03:12:34,668 --> 03:12:37,128
that seemed so important
at the time?

1602
03:12:41,425 --> 03:12:44,052
I sit here growing melancholy,

1603
03:12:44,178 --> 03:12:47,722
thinking time was all too short.

1604
03:12:54,188 --> 03:12:57,190
Your father used to say
I was sentimental.

1605
03:12:57,608 --> 03:13:00,818
He wasn't known
as a particularly sensitive man.

1606
03:13:01,946 --> 03:13:04,822
He was both angry
and indignant when he died.

1607
03:13:07,368 --> 03:13:09,744
He never thought life was cruel

1608
03:13:10,245 --> 03:13:11,871
or unfair

1609
03:13:12,498 --> 03:13:13,873
or beautiful.

1610
03:13:15,584 --> 03:13:20,296
He just lived and didn't care to comment.
He left that to me.

1611
03:13:21,048 --> 03:13:23,633
And when I went on about life,

1612
03:13:23,759 --> 03:13:26,803
he laughed and called me sentimental.

1613
03:13:31,141 --> 03:13:33,017
But I was an artist.

1614
03:13:34,311 --> 03:13:37,563
As an artist,
I had a right to be emotional.

1615
03:13:45,739 --> 03:13:47,949
Oscar, my dear boy.

1616
03:13:50,244 --> 03:13:52,787
I may be worrying for no reason,

1617
03:13:53,497 --> 03:13:55,748
but when you have nothing
to occupy your thoughts,

1618
03:13:55,916 --> 03:13:57,834
you immediately start worrying.

1619
03:14:06,510 --> 03:14:08,094
May I take your hand?

1620
03:14:13,976 --> 03:14:16,602
I remember your hand as a child.

1621
03:14:16,770 --> 03:14:20,440
It was small and firm and dry.

1622
03:14:23,652 --> 03:14:27,071
And your wrist
was so awfully slender.

1623
03:14:30,701 --> 03:14:32,660
I enjoyed being a mother.

1624
03:14:33,078 --> 03:14:36,581
I enjoyed being an actress, too,
but I preferred being a mother.

1625
03:14:38,459 --> 03:14:41,002
I liked having a big belly,

1626
03:14:41,503 --> 03:14:44,464
and I didn't give two shakes
about the theater then.

1627
03:14:48,677 --> 03:14:51,012
It's all acting anyway.

1628
03:14:51,430 --> 03:14:53,681
Some roles are nice,
others not so nice.

1629
03:14:54,975 --> 03:14:57,477
I played a mother.

1630
03:14:57,603 --> 03:14:59,771
I played Juliet and Margareta.

1631
03:15:00,898 --> 03:15:04,025
Then suddenly I played a widow
or a grandmother.

1632
03:15:04,693 --> 03:15:06,861
One role follows the other.

1633
03:15:08,280 --> 03:15:10,782
The thing is
not to shrink from them.

1634
03:15:13,202 --> 03:15:16,454
But what became of it all?

1635
03:15:17,790 --> 03:15:20,166
Can you tell me that, my boy?

1636
03:15:23,545 --> 03:15:25,088
You're a good boy

1637
03:15:25,214 --> 03:15:30,718
to listen to your old mother's soliloquies,
as Isak calls them.

1638
03:15:35,349 --> 03:15:38,184
Yes, you're a good boy, Oscar...

1639
03:15:40,604 --> 03:15:43,064
and I grieved terribly
when you passed away.

1640
03:15:46,693 --> 03:15:49,487
That was a strange role to play.

1641
03:15:50,739 --> 03:15:53,407
My feelings came
from deep in my body.

1642
03:15:55,202 --> 03:15:56,994
Even though I could control them...

1643
03:15:59,081 --> 03:16:03,876
they shattered reality,
if you know what I mean.

1644
03:16:07,965 --> 03:16:10,716
Reality has remained broken
ever since...

1645
03:16:11,885 --> 03:16:14,929
and, oddly enough,
it feels more real that way.

1646
03:16:18,475 --> 03:16:21,602
So I don't bother to mend it.

1647
03:16:22,563 --> 03:16:25,940
I just don't care anymore
if nothing makes sense.

1648
03:16:31,572 --> 03:16:33,865
Oscar, my dear boy?

1649
03:16:33,991 --> 03:16:36,450
- Yes, Mama.
- Are you sad?

1650
03:16:37,828 --> 03:16:39,036
I'm worried.

1651
03:16:39,163 --> 03:16:41,080
About the children?

1652
03:16:46,795 --> 03:16:48,171
Yes.

1653
03:16:51,884 --> 03:16:54,510
Get up. Your stepfather
wants to talk to you.

1654
03:16:57,931 --> 03:17:00,266
Get dressed.
Your stepfather wants to talk to you.

1655
03:17:04,688 --> 03:17:05,771
Hurry up!

1656
03:17:12,279 --> 03:17:13,696
Who's there?

1657
03:17:14,740 --> 03:17:16,073
It's just me.

1658
03:17:30,797 --> 03:17:32,673
Alexander, my boy.

1659
03:17:34,384 --> 03:17:37,303
In the presence of your sister
and Justina you have accused me

1660
03:17:37,429 --> 03:17:39,472
of having murdered
my wife and children.

1661
03:17:39,598 --> 03:17:40,598
What?

1662
03:17:41,767 --> 03:17:43,976
Justina, please repeat
what you told me.

1663
03:17:45,646 --> 03:17:49,523
Alexander said he had seen
your first wife and children.

1664
03:17:50,234 --> 03:17:55,154
She spoke to him
and said that the bishop

1665
03:17:55,280 --> 03:18:00,409
had locked them all up
without food and water.

1666
03:18:01,036 --> 03:18:04,038
On the fifth day they tried to escape

1667
03:18:04,623 --> 03:18:06,832
but drowned in the attempt.

1668
03:18:08,335 --> 03:18:11,462
- Do you recognize the story?
- No.

1669
03:18:14,633 --> 03:18:19,011
- So Justina has given false testimony?
- She could have dreamt it.

1670
03:18:21,932 --> 03:18:25,268
Justina, are you prepared to confirm
your statement under oath?

1671
03:18:25,394 --> 03:18:26,769
Yes, Your Grace.

1672
03:18:27,020 --> 03:18:28,521
Good, Justina.

1673
03:18:28,689 --> 03:18:32,775
Fanny, did you hear
Alexander's story?

1674
03:18:32,901 --> 03:18:33,859
No.

1675
03:18:39,616 --> 03:18:43,202
So you maintain that Justina

1676
03:18:43,996 --> 03:18:47,331
was either lying or dreaming?

1677
03:18:47,624 --> 03:18:48,624
Yes.

1678
03:18:56,091 --> 03:18:58,092
Please come here, Alexander.

1679
03:18:58,885 --> 03:19:02,013
Are you prepared to swear to it?

1680
03:19:02,139 --> 03:19:03,472
Of course.

1681
03:19:03,598 --> 03:19:05,933
It's a mortal sin to swear falsely.

1682
03:19:07,477 --> 03:19:10,980
It's called perjury
and is severely punished.

1683
03:19:12,024 --> 03:19:13,274
Really?

1684
03:19:15,319 --> 03:19:17,862
Lay your hand on the Bible
and say after me:

1685
03:19:20,574 --> 03:19:22,241
"I, Alexander Ekdahl...

1686
03:19:24,703 --> 03:19:28,289
swear by Holy Writ
and by the living God...

1687
03:19:32,419 --> 03:19:37,006
that all I have said,
say and will say...

1688
03:19:41,887 --> 03:19:44,555
is the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

1689
03:19:52,522 --> 03:19:54,398
Alexander, my boy.

1690
03:19:56,443 --> 03:19:58,361
You remember that the two of us

1691
03:19:58,945 --> 03:20:02,615
had an important conversation
about a year ago.

1692
03:20:02,783 --> 03:20:04,700
It concerned certain moral questions.

1693
03:20:05,285 --> 03:20:07,411
It wasn't really a conversation.

1694
03:20:10,624 --> 03:20:12,124
What do you mean?

1695
03:20:12,250 --> 03:20:14,877
The bishop spoke
and Alexander said nothing.

1696
03:20:16,463 --> 03:20:19,590
And felt ashamed, perhaps,
on account of your lies.

1697
03:20:20,675 --> 03:20:22,635
I've grown wiser since then.

1698
03:20:24,179 --> 03:20:26,097
You mean you lie better.

1699
03:20:26,473 --> 03:20:27,723
More or less.

1700
03:20:36,149 --> 03:20:37,983
I don't know what you imagine.

1701
03:20:38,110 --> 03:20:44,156
Do you think you can besmirch
another person's honor with impunity?

1702
03:20:46,243 --> 03:20:48,494
Do you think you can lie

1703
03:20:48,620 --> 03:20:51,163
and get away with perjury
without consequence?

1704
03:20:55,001 --> 03:20:58,170
Do you think this is a game,
Alexander?

1705
03:20:58,296 --> 03:21:01,757
Or a play in which the children
get to make up their lines?

1706
03:21:02,509 --> 03:21:06,929
I think the bishop hates Alexander.
That's what I think.

1707
03:21:09,599 --> 03:21:12,017
Oh, so that's what you think.

1708
03:21:14,855 --> 03:21:16,772
I'll tell you something

1709
03:21:18,024 --> 03:21:20,192
that may come as a surprise.

1710
03:21:22,487 --> 03:21:24,113
I don't hate you.

1711
03:21:26,992 --> 03:21:28,534
I love you.

1712
03:21:29,703 --> 03:21:34,707
But the love I feel for you

1713
03:21:35,625 --> 03:21:37,710
and your mother and sister

1714
03:21:38,003 --> 03:21:40,171
is not blind and sloppy.

1715
03:21:40,881 --> 03:21:43,966
It is strong and harsh.

1716
03:21:48,388 --> 03:21:50,848
Do you hear what I say?
- No.

1717
03:21:57,397 --> 03:21:59,231
You're hardening your heart.

1718
03:22:01,067 --> 03:22:03,527
Moreover, you misjudge the situation.

1719
03:22:04,905 --> 03:22:10,201
I am much stronger than you are.
- I don't doubt it.

1720
03:22:10,327 --> 03:22:12,369
I mean stronger spiritually.

1721
03:22:13,830 --> 03:22:16,540
Because I have truth and justice

1722
03:22:16,666 --> 03:22:18,083
on my side.

1723
03:22:27,052 --> 03:22:30,971
I know you'll confess
in a little while.

1724
03:22:31,473 --> 03:22:36,435
Your confession and punishment
will be a relief to you.

1725
03:22:39,022 --> 03:22:40,940
You're a wise little man, Alexander.

1726
03:22:41,066 --> 03:22:43,442
You realize that the game is up...

1727
03:22:44,611 --> 03:22:48,906
but you are proud and stubborn...

1728
03:22:50,825 --> 03:22:53,035
and of course you are ashamed.

1729
03:22:53,161 --> 03:22:55,287
I've forgotten what I'm to confess.

1730
03:22:56,122 --> 03:22:57,456
Have you now.

1731
03:22:58,250 --> 03:23:00,376
What does the bishop want
Alexander to confess?

1732
03:23:00,502 --> 03:23:02,836
You know I have means at my disposal.

1733
03:23:02,963 --> 03:23:04,630
I didn't, but I do now.

1734
03:23:06,299 --> 03:23:08,801
In my childhood,
parents were not so softhearted.

1735
03:23:10,136 --> 03:23:12,930
They had the cane.
I have one too.

1736
03:23:13,056 --> 03:23:16,892
It's an ordinary carpet beater,
but it can dance a fine step!

1737
03:23:18,395 --> 03:23:22,982
If that didn't work, we had other
effective means, namely castor oil.

1738
03:23:23,149 --> 03:23:25,693
There you see the bottle and a glass.

1739
03:23:26,528 --> 03:23:30,489
A few mouthfuls of this
and you're more docile.

1740
03:23:31,992 --> 03:23:37,037
If that didn't help,
there was a dark and cold cubbyhole

1741
03:23:37,998 --> 03:23:41,584
where you sat for a few hours until
the rats started sniffing at your face.

1742
03:23:43,128 --> 03:23:44,753
Why must I be punished?

1743
03:23:46,673 --> 03:23:49,008
That is obvious, my boy.

1744
03:23:50,010 --> 03:23:52,428
You have a weakness in your character.

1745
03:23:52,554 --> 03:23:54,388
You can't distinguish lies from truth.

1746
03:23:54,514 --> 03:23:59,518
So far they are just child's lies,
however dreadful they may be.

1747
03:24:01,646 --> 03:24:05,274
But soon you will be
a grown man, Alexander,

1748
03:24:06,359 --> 03:24:09,403
and life punishes liars
ruthlessly and indiscriminately.

1749
03:24:12,365 --> 03:24:16,827
The punishment is to teach you

1750
03:24:16,953 --> 03:24:18,454
a love of truth.

1751
03:24:20,624 --> 03:24:24,877
I confess I made it up about locking
your wife and children in.

1752
03:24:27,047 --> 03:24:31,133
- Do you also confess to perjury?
- I suppose so.

1753
03:24:31,885 --> 03:24:36,221
Now you've won a great victory.

1754
03:24:38,558 --> 03:24:40,517
A victory over yourself.

1755
03:24:47,400 --> 03:24:49,026
Which punishment do you choose?

1756
03:24:49,152 --> 03:24:51,904
Cane, castor oil
or the dark cubbyhole?

1757
03:24:53,323 --> 03:24:55,949
- How many strokes of the cane?
- Ten.

1758
03:24:56,076 --> 03:24:57,701
Then I choose the cane.

1759
03:25:02,374 --> 03:25:05,918
Take two cushions
and put them on the table.

1760
03:25:09,923 --> 03:25:11,924
Pull your pants down.

1761
03:25:16,596 --> 03:25:17,638
Bend over.

1762
03:25:55,969 --> 03:25:57,636
Stand up.

1763
03:25:58,805 --> 03:26:01,014
- You have something to say to me.
- No.

1764
03:26:02,600 --> 03:26:04,643
You must ask my forgiveness.

1765
03:26:05,353 --> 03:26:07,020
I won't.

1766
03:26:08,356 --> 03:26:11,066
Then I must cane you
until you think better of it.

1767
03:26:11,192 --> 03:26:13,902
Can't you spare us both
that unpleasant experience?

1768
03:26:14,028 --> 03:26:15,904
I'll never apologize.

1769
03:26:17,532 --> 03:26:20,492
You won't apologize?

1770
03:26:20,952 --> 03:26:21,910
No.

1771
03:26:23,204 --> 03:26:24,872
Bend over.

1772
03:26:28,585 --> 03:26:30,002
No more, please!

1773
03:26:31,880 --> 03:26:34,173
Will you ask forgiveness now?

1774
03:26:34,507 --> 03:26:35,507
Yes.

1775
03:26:37,677 --> 03:26:41,805
Button your pants and blow your nose.
Lend him a handkerchief, Justina.

1776
03:26:46,394 --> 03:26:49,188
What do you have to say now?

1777
03:26:51,483 --> 03:26:53,609
Alexander asks the bishop
for forgiveness.

1778
03:26:53,735 --> 03:26:57,154
Speak up.
I want everyone to hear your regret.

1779
03:26:57,906 --> 03:27:00,532
Alexander asks the bishop
for forgiveness.

1780
03:27:00,700 --> 03:27:02,785
For the lies and the perjury.

1781
03:27:07,665 --> 03:27:10,876
You do understand
that I punished you out of love?

1782
03:27:11,002 --> 03:27:12,377
Yes!

1783
03:27:13,880 --> 03:27:15,464
Kiss my hand, Alexander.

1784
03:27:16,216 --> 03:27:18,342
- May I go to bed now?
- Yes, you may.

1785
03:27:20,470 --> 03:27:26,391
But so that you may contemplate
the day's events in peace and quiet...

1786
03:27:27,644 --> 03:27:29,436
you're to sleep in the attic.

1787
03:27:29,979 --> 03:27:32,856
Justina will provide
a mattress and a blanket.

1788
03:27:33,483 --> 03:27:38,403
At 6:00 in the morning
you will be let out. Understood?

1789
03:27:38,571 --> 03:27:40,197
Yes, Your Grace!

1790
03:27:57,549 --> 03:27:59,967
Helena, it's hardest on the children.

1791
03:28:02,095 --> 03:28:04,263
They're punished
for the slightest misdeed.

1792
03:28:04,806 --> 03:28:08,809
His mother locks them up,
puts them to bed in the middle of the day.

1793
03:28:09,269 --> 03:28:12,104
A week ago, Fanny refused
to finish her porridge.

1794
03:28:13,439 --> 03:28:15,232
She had to sit there all night.

1795
03:28:15,567 --> 03:28:17,693
She threw up on the plate.
At last she finished it.

1796
03:28:19,988 --> 03:28:24,283
He's mad with jealousy
but doesn't realize it's mutual.

1797
03:28:24,993 --> 03:28:26,743
My poor Emilie.

1798
03:28:26,870 --> 03:28:28,954
How could I be so blind?

1799
03:28:30,582 --> 03:28:32,541
How could I feel
compassion for that man?

1800
03:28:33,334 --> 03:28:36,628
I'm an actress. I should have
seen through his pretense.

1801
03:28:37,964 --> 03:28:40,883
But I had lived practically alone
since Fanny was born.

1802
03:28:42,260 --> 03:28:44,887
I hated my occasional
emotional storms.

1803
03:28:49,267 --> 03:28:51,101
Oscar was my best friend.

1804
03:28:51,895 --> 03:28:53,562
You know that, Helena.

1805
03:28:55,148 --> 03:28:57,190
You know how fond I was of him,

1806
03:28:57,984 --> 03:28:59,610
how sincere my grief was

1807
03:28:59,736 --> 03:29:01,320
when he left us.

1808
03:29:01,946 --> 03:29:03,405
I don't blame you for anything.

1809
03:29:03,531 --> 03:29:05,908
I saw nothing, understood nothing.

1810
03:29:07,410 --> 03:29:09,828
He spoke to me of another life.

1811
03:29:10,538 --> 03:29:12,122
A life of demands,

1812
03:29:12,624 --> 03:29:15,500
of purity, of joy
in the performance of duty.

1813
03:29:15,668 --> 03:29:17,461
I'd never heard such words.

1814
03:29:18,254 --> 03:29:21,214
There seemed to be a light around him
when he spoke to me.

1815
03:29:23,343 --> 03:29:27,012
At the same time,
I could tell he was Ionely, unhappy...

1816
03:29:28,056 --> 03:29:30,140
haunted by fear and bad dreams.

1817
03:29:36,731 --> 03:29:39,191
He assured me I would save him.

1818
03:29:41,194 --> 03:29:45,155
He said together with the children
we'd live in nearness to God.

1819
03:29:46,532 --> 03:29:47,866
In the truth.

1820
03:29:50,662 --> 03:29:54,414
The truth -
that was the most important part.

1821
03:29:56,209 --> 03:29:58,001
I was so thirsty.

1822
03:29:58,544 --> 03:30:01,004
I know it sounds dramatic
and overstrung, Helena...

1823
03:30:02,256 --> 03:30:06,426
but I thirsted for truth
and felt I'd been living a lie.

1824
03:30:07,971 --> 03:30:11,056
I must go.
A carriage is waiting at the gate.

1825
03:30:11,224 --> 03:30:13,225
I'm afraid something might have
happened while I've been here.

1826
03:30:14,352 --> 03:30:17,562
I'm in constant fear that Alexander
will say something to displease him.

1827
03:30:17,730 --> 03:30:20,399
Alexander is so foolhardy.
I've tried to warn him,

1828
03:30:20,566 --> 03:30:23,527
but he can't see that his stepfather
is a dangerous opponent

1829
03:30:23,653 --> 03:30:26,029
who's just waiting
for the right opportunity to crush him.

1830
03:30:26,155 --> 03:30:28,323
You must leave him, Emilie.

1831
03:30:29,784 --> 03:30:31,535
I'm pregnant.

1832
03:30:35,748 --> 03:30:37,332
Nevertheless, you must -

1833
03:30:37,458 --> 03:30:39,126
Forgive me for interrupting.

1834
03:30:40,253 --> 03:30:42,254
I've asked him for a divorce.

1835
03:30:43,464 --> 03:30:44,923
He refuses.

1836
03:30:46,259 --> 03:30:48,510
I tell him that I'll leave
just the same.

1837
03:30:50,221 --> 03:30:53,348
Then he explains in detail
what will happen.

1838
03:30:55,018 --> 03:30:58,937
In a court of law, I'll lose on grounds
of "desertion," as it's called.

1839
03:31:01,524 --> 03:31:05,110
The children will be taken from me,
to be brought up by him.

1840
03:31:11,743 --> 03:31:15,287
I've written in secret
to a friend of mine who's a lawyer.

1841
03:31:17,790 --> 03:31:20,542
He's confirmed what Edvard says.

1842
03:31:21,544 --> 03:31:23,253
I am shut in

1843
03:31:24,213 --> 03:31:26,465
and can no longer breathe.

1844
03:31:29,510 --> 03:31:31,178
I'm dying, Helena!

1845
03:31:34,265 --> 03:31:36,892
I hate that man so violently

1846
03:31:37,727 --> 03:31:39,186
that I could -

1847
03:31:51,240 --> 03:31:53,325
Don't mention that I've been here.

1848
03:31:54,285 --> 03:31:55,827
To anybody.

1849
03:32:41,290 --> 03:32:42,415
Mother.

1850
03:32:54,512 --> 03:32:55,470
Father.

1851
03:32:58,599 --> 03:33:00,433
If you're coming to visit...

1852
03:33:01,727 --> 03:33:03,895
please remember
I'm scared of ghosts...

1853
03:33:05,231 --> 03:33:06,898
and that you're actually dead.

1854
03:33:11,237 --> 03:33:13,238
Don't sneak up on me from behind.

1855
03:33:17,034 --> 03:33:20,704
I might go mad from fear.
You wouldn't want that, right?

1856
03:33:26,169 --> 03:33:29,588
I don't understand
why I always have to see dead people

1857
03:33:30,256 --> 03:33:31,965
when it makes me sick.

1858
03:33:38,014 --> 03:33:39,598
Damn it!

1859
03:33:42,476 --> 03:33:44,102
Ah, hell!

1860
03:33:45,813 --> 03:33:47,314
My name's Pauline.

1861
03:33:48,399 --> 03:33:51,109
My sister Esmeralda
is over by the crucifix.

1862
03:33:53,112 --> 03:33:55,572
She's mad at you, Alexander.
- Why?

1863
03:33:55,698 --> 03:33:57,490
She wants us to punish you.

1864
03:33:59,702 --> 03:34:01,369
Why do you look so surprised?

1865
03:34:01,954 --> 03:34:04,998
You know very well why we're mad.
- No, I don't.

1866
03:34:06,042 --> 03:34:08,251
You lied about our father.

1867
03:34:08,377 --> 03:34:11,296
You said he locked us up.
That's not true.

1868
03:34:13,257 --> 03:34:15,508
The floodgates had been closed
for several weeks,

1869
03:34:15,635 --> 03:34:17,385
and the river had frozen over.

1870
03:34:18,137 --> 03:34:20,263
We'd gotten new skates for Christmas.

1871
03:34:20,556 --> 03:34:23,308
But the ice broke,
and we fell into the water.

1872
03:34:24,435 --> 03:34:29,022
Mother tried to save us,
but the current dragged us under the ice.

1873
03:34:30,233 --> 03:34:32,525
Now you know the truth, wretched boy.

1874
03:34:33,653 --> 03:34:38,156
My sister and I thought we'd free
our father from you and your hatred.

1875
03:34:38,699 --> 03:34:41,493
We'II scare the wits out of you
so you end up in the hospital,

1876
03:34:41,619 --> 03:34:43,912
locked in a cell,
chained hand and foot.

1877
03:34:44,038 --> 03:34:45,664
Please, don't frighten me!

1878
03:34:51,462 --> 03:34:53,713
- Give me the key!
- Edvard has forbidden it.

1879
03:34:53,839 --> 03:34:55,340
Give me the key now!

1880
03:34:55,508 --> 03:34:57,592
Edvard has forbidden it!

1881
03:34:59,595 --> 03:35:01,179
You're hurting me!

1882
03:35:07,311 --> 03:35:08,853
Emilie, you can't!

1883
03:36:00,656 --> 03:36:03,575
Carl, don't forget the cognac.

1884
03:36:03,743 --> 03:36:05,910
There's none left.

1885
03:36:16,172 --> 03:36:18,923
Take your damn paint box!

1886
03:36:23,763 --> 03:36:25,388
Listen to me.

1887
03:36:25,514 --> 03:36:29,100
I told you, there's none left.

1888
03:36:32,605 --> 03:36:36,316
- Alma, we're to go up to see Grandmama.
- What are you shouting about?

1889
03:36:37,401 --> 03:36:39,069
I'm just shouting!

1890
03:36:40,571 --> 03:36:43,406
Punch will do just as well!

1891
03:36:56,420 --> 03:36:58,630
The old girl's not here.

1892
03:36:59,382 --> 03:37:01,216
She's probably in the dining room.

1893
03:37:02,093 --> 03:37:04,552
Good evening, Mama.
We came to see how you are.

1894
03:37:04,678 --> 03:37:06,262
I'm splendid.

1895
03:37:06,389 --> 03:37:07,972
I hope you aren't Ionely.

1896
03:37:08,224 --> 03:37:11,184
Lonely? I love being alone.

1897
03:37:11,310 --> 03:37:13,269
Vega was bitten by a wasp.

1898
03:37:13,396 --> 03:37:15,647
A wasp stings, my dear.

1899
03:37:15,773 --> 03:37:17,816
It has a stinger
just like your old man.

1900
03:37:17,983 --> 03:37:19,734
Don't pinch me.

1901
03:37:20,444 --> 03:37:22,821
And Petra fell in the lake
and got soaked.

1902
03:37:22,947 --> 03:37:25,657
Where shall I serve supper?

1903
03:37:25,866 --> 03:37:27,492
I don't want any.

1904
03:37:27,618 --> 03:37:31,079
- How's the wasp sting?
- Not worth talking about.

1905
03:37:34,166 --> 03:37:36,334
And Mama is busy
with the old man's photographs.

1906
03:37:36,460 --> 03:37:39,421
How many thousands
have you sorted by now?

1907
03:37:39,713 --> 03:37:42,298
Here's one of you and your brothers.

1908
03:37:42,466 --> 03:37:44,676
You couldn't have been
more than five years old.

1909
03:37:44,844 --> 03:37:48,555
- You can already tell which brother -
- Who is this beautiful woman?

1910
03:37:48,681 --> 03:37:50,723
Did it rain on you the whole time?

1911
03:37:50,850 --> 03:37:52,809
No, not at all, dearest Mama.

1912
03:37:52,935 --> 03:37:55,103
Not a cloud over the outer islands,

1913
03:37:55,229 --> 03:37:58,231
but we saw the rain over the mainland,
and heard the thunder.

1914
03:37:58,357 --> 03:37:59,858
It's rained all day here.

1915
03:37:59,984 --> 03:38:04,696
This woman with the low neckline
was one of Papa's lady friends.

1916
03:38:05,072 --> 03:38:07,699
You're mistaken.
We were at school together.

1917
03:38:07,867 --> 03:38:11,578
She married a count, had 12 children
and became as big as a house.

1918
03:38:11,704 --> 03:38:16,749
I always admired your skillful way
of handling Papa's little adventures.

1919
03:38:17,460 --> 03:38:18,877
We must be going.

1920
03:38:19,003 --> 03:38:22,338
Mr. Öhman and his lovely wife
are going to stop by.

1921
03:38:22,465 --> 03:38:25,383
I'm going into town tomorrow.
Anything I can do for you?

1922
03:38:25,509 --> 03:38:28,011
Thank you, Gusten.
I don't need anything.

1923
03:38:28,137 --> 03:38:30,805
But I'd like to talk
to you about Maj.

1924
03:38:31,599 --> 03:38:34,225
What the hell is it now?
She's got it good.

1925
03:38:34,727 --> 03:38:37,395
Now I'm damned angry -
if you'll excuse me, Mama.

1926
03:38:37,563 --> 03:38:39,022
Calm down, Gusten!

1927
03:38:43,277 --> 03:38:45,612
He loses his temper
at the mention of Maj's name.

1928
03:38:45,738 --> 03:38:47,322
I just want to say -

1929
03:38:47,448 --> 03:38:51,826
You have to realize
Maj is not your private plaything.

1930
03:38:52,328 --> 03:38:55,580
Thanks to Alma's broad-mindedness,
she's a member of our family,

1931
03:38:55,748 --> 03:38:58,416
and she's expecting my grandchild.

1932
03:38:59,335 --> 03:39:02,879
In your dictatorial way,
you've decided her future.

1933
03:39:03,589 --> 03:39:04,839
I don't give a damn -

1934
03:39:04,965 --> 03:39:07,592
I don't like it when you swear
in your mother's presence.

1935
03:39:07,760 --> 03:39:09,761
You hear me, Gusten?

1936
03:39:20,272 --> 03:39:22,857
I like the girl. I wish her well.

1937
03:39:23,567 --> 03:39:25,443
I want to ensure her future.

1938
03:39:25,569 --> 03:39:28,780
I don't want her to be dependent
on the family's benevolence if I die.

1939
03:39:28,906 --> 03:39:30,657
She's accepted my suggestions.

1940
03:39:30,783 --> 03:39:34,786
She doesn't need any protectors,
especially against me.

1941
03:39:34,954 --> 03:39:36,704
Stop your twaddle!

1942
03:39:38,332 --> 03:39:42,043
Don't make me out as a dictator!
Maj has decided it all herself!

1943
03:39:45,297 --> 03:39:46,631
I like her.

1944
03:39:48,592 --> 03:39:50,969
I'm kind to her.
Alma's kind to her.

1945
03:39:51,136 --> 03:39:54,472
Now I'm hurt, let me tell you.
Damned hurt!

1946
03:39:56,976 --> 03:39:59,978
There's no reason
to side with Maj against me!

1947
03:40:05,150 --> 03:40:07,777
I'm fond of her.
Alma's fond of her.

1948
03:40:07,903 --> 03:40:10,780
She is loved in the same way
as Jenny, Petra and Putte.

1949
03:40:10,906 --> 03:40:14,325
Well, not exactly in the same way,
but almost.

1950
03:40:18,247 --> 03:40:19,789
She's good to me.

1951
03:40:20,040 --> 03:40:22,458
She doesn't think
I'm fat and old and disgusting.

1952
03:40:22,585 --> 03:40:25,086
Nobody thinks that, by the -

1953
03:40:25,212 --> 03:40:28,506
I've a soft spot for the ladies.
What's to be done about it?

1954
03:40:29,174 --> 03:40:30,675
That's nothing to giggle at.

1955
03:40:30,968 --> 03:40:33,177
Maj is to go her own way through life,

1956
03:40:33,304 --> 03:40:35,305
and I'm going to give her
solid ground to stand on.

1957
03:40:35,431 --> 03:40:37,015
That's enough said about that.

1958
03:40:37,182 --> 03:40:41,102
The opera singer said he would stop by
with his wife and children. Come now.

1959
03:40:42,104 --> 03:40:44,689
Good-bye, Mama. Give me a kiss.

1960
03:40:46,358 --> 03:40:51,988
I don't want you and Alma
to sit gossiping about Maj's future.

1961
03:40:52,573 --> 03:40:54,574
I'll see to that!

1962
03:40:55,159 --> 03:40:56,909
Or rather, she will.

1963
03:40:58,454 --> 03:41:00,038
Good night, Mama.
Come, Alma.

1964
03:41:00,205 --> 03:41:04,417
- I'll be back in a couple of hours.
- Like hell you will! Come on!

1965
03:41:04,918 --> 03:41:08,046
Calm down or you'II have a stroke.

1966
03:41:08,213 --> 03:41:11,841
I am calm.
You're the one who's shouting.

1967
03:41:11,967 --> 03:41:15,219
I want an end to all that gossip
between you and Mama!

1968
03:41:48,128 --> 03:41:51,714
Carlchen, you can't demand
that I ask her.

1969
03:41:51,840 --> 03:41:56,594
Mama distrusts me and it's your fault.
Therefore I can't ask her.

1970
03:41:56,720 --> 03:41:59,430
I don't see how I can say anything.

1971
03:41:59,556 --> 03:42:03,101
- Tell her I'm desperate.
- You can tell her better yourself.

1972
03:42:03,268 --> 03:42:05,603
Make it clear
I've been contemplating suicide.

1973
03:42:08,607 --> 03:42:10,441
Is that really true?

1974
03:42:13,612 --> 03:42:16,030
We can be poor together.

1975
03:42:16,907 --> 03:42:18,616
I will to work.

1976
03:42:20,828 --> 03:42:24,330
Idiot. Bonehead. Fool.

1977
03:42:24,456 --> 03:42:26,207
"I will work."

1978
03:42:26,291 --> 03:42:28,543
I'm sorry. I will work.

1979
03:42:30,295 --> 03:42:33,005
What do you want me to say,
mein Carlchen?

1980
03:42:33,090 --> 03:42:35,758
Don't you have
any imagination, you imbecile?

1981
03:42:36,510 --> 03:42:40,722
Say I look unhappy,
that I've stopped eating,

1982
03:42:41,056 --> 03:42:42,598
that I lie awake at night.

1983
03:42:42,725 --> 03:42:45,810
Yes, you do lie awake with insomnia.

1984
03:42:45,936 --> 03:42:47,645
It damn well is insomnia!

1985
03:42:48,564 --> 03:42:51,774
Say that I've grown quiet,
that I never laugh,

1986
03:42:51,900 --> 03:42:55,236
and when I do, it sounds dreadful.
Understand?

1987
03:42:56,572 --> 03:42:58,698
Don't just come
right out with it, damn it.

1988
03:42:59,700 --> 03:43:02,994
Lead her to suspect
I've spoken of suicide.

1989
03:43:03,120 --> 03:43:07,749
Don't say that terrible word,
or I'll start crying.

1990
03:43:07,875 --> 03:43:09,709
Stupid slut.

1991
03:43:11,795 --> 03:43:13,755
Do you think of suicide, mein Schatz?

1992
03:43:14,006 --> 03:43:15,798
Only when I look at you.

1993
03:43:16,341 --> 03:43:18,926
Why are you so cruel?

1994
03:43:21,680 --> 03:43:23,681
Don't go, goddamn it!

1995
03:43:25,517 --> 03:43:27,059
Where are you going?

1996
03:43:28,520 --> 03:43:30,104
Why the hell are you leaving?

1997
03:43:30,230 --> 03:43:32,482
I won't talk to your mother.

1998
03:43:32,691 --> 03:43:35,026
I'm going home.
Du bist böse.

1999
03:43:35,944 --> 03:43:37,528
I have to cry.

2000
03:43:38,989 --> 03:43:41,365
You don't understand that I love you.

2001
03:43:42,201 --> 03:43:45,703
Now I'm crying,
and I won't be able to stop.

2002
03:43:45,954 --> 03:43:47,789
Dear God, my creator,

2003
03:43:47,915 --> 03:43:52,835
why must I go on acting
in this wretched farce?

2004
03:43:52,961 --> 03:43:54,337
Lydia, stop!

2005
03:44:00,969 --> 03:44:03,221
Let me help you.

2006
03:44:03,764 --> 03:44:05,264
Oh, goddamn it!

2007
03:44:05,474 --> 03:44:07,600
Just look at this.

2008
03:44:13,315 --> 03:44:14,732
Pick up your shawl.

2009
03:44:15,234 --> 03:44:17,527
Damn it all! My leg!

2010
03:44:32,125 --> 03:44:33,084
Grandma.

2011
03:44:37,798 --> 03:44:42,093
- Shouldn't you be in bed?
- We sneaked out.

2012
03:44:42,928 --> 03:44:44,595
What will your mother say?

2013
03:44:44,763 --> 03:44:47,473
She won't find out.
Unless Grandma tattles, of course.

2014
03:44:47,599 --> 03:44:49,684
What do you want
from your old grandma?

2015
03:45:10,372 --> 03:45:11,914
Welcome home, Emilie.

2016
03:45:13,458 --> 03:45:15,042
You were gone a long time.

2017
03:45:18,380 --> 03:45:20,506
We almost began to worry.

2018
03:45:23,969 --> 03:45:26,178
Mrs. Tander wonders
if you'd like something to eat.

2019
03:45:26,305 --> 03:45:27,805
I'm not hungry.

2020
03:45:29,600 --> 03:45:31,183
I'll let her know.

2021
03:45:34,104 --> 03:45:36,981
Will you be coming to bed soon?
- When the children are asleep.

2022
03:45:40,277 --> 03:45:43,696
I'll be reading in the library.
Please don't be long.

2023
03:45:43,780 --> 03:45:44,989
Good night, children.

2024
03:45:52,706 --> 03:45:55,666
We had actually decided

2025
03:45:55,834 --> 03:45:57,501
Alexander would sleep
in the attic tonight.

2026
03:45:57,669 --> 03:45:59,712
But I understand
that decision has changed.

2027
03:45:59,838 --> 03:46:00,838
Yes, it has.

2028
03:46:02,883 --> 03:46:06,093
Very well. Perhaps it's best.

2029
03:46:08,931 --> 03:46:11,265
Good night, Fanny.
- Good night, Uncle Edvard.

2030
03:46:11,850 --> 03:46:13,142
Good night, Alexander.

2031
03:46:17,439 --> 03:46:18,522
Is he asleep?

2032
03:46:18,690 --> 03:46:20,149
No, I'm not.

2033
03:46:20,275 --> 03:46:23,194
Then you can also answer me
when I bid you good night.

2034
03:46:23,320 --> 03:46:24,362
I can't.

2035
03:46:24,488 --> 03:46:28,950
You can't?
What nonsense is that?

2036
03:46:29,952 --> 03:46:32,745
Alexander doesn't wish
the bishop a good night.

2037
03:46:39,336 --> 03:46:41,545
You have a sense of humor.
I like that.

2038
03:47:26,174 --> 03:47:29,093
Well, did you see
your mother-in-law and relatives?

2039
03:47:30,595 --> 03:47:32,263
Was it a nice visit?

2040
03:47:34,016 --> 03:47:36,684
Did it rain? It rained
and thundered here all day.

2041
03:47:38,937 --> 03:47:42,064
Well, a little moisture's good,
at least for the farmers.

2042
03:47:45,360 --> 03:47:48,988
Alexander and I had
a little review this afternoon.

2043
03:47:50,282 --> 03:47:53,325
The usual: He couldn't distinguish
fantasy from reality.

2044
03:47:53,618 --> 03:47:55,911
But we clarified the concepts.

2045
03:47:57,956 --> 03:48:00,124
He's not stupid, that Alexander.

2046
03:48:02,335 --> 03:48:04,462
He's not stupid,
but he's very unforgiving.

2047
03:48:06,882 --> 03:48:10,843
"Alexander doesn't wish
the bishop a good night."

2048
03:48:12,345 --> 03:48:14,305
That's really priceless.

2049
03:48:19,561 --> 03:48:21,979
You're not saying anything.
Are you mad about something?

2050
03:48:22,147 --> 03:48:23,606
You locked up the children.

2051
03:48:25,484 --> 03:48:29,695
A safety measure, Emilie.
I wanted to guarantee you would return.

2052
03:48:29,821 --> 03:48:31,489
You abused Alexander.

2053
03:48:32,991 --> 03:48:35,785
You're so dramatic.

2054
03:48:35,911 --> 03:48:37,995
I punished him.

2055
03:48:39,164 --> 03:48:41,165
That's my duty as his guardian.

2056
03:48:41,291 --> 03:48:44,043
Besides, the punishment was mild
in comparison to the offense.

2057
03:48:44,878 --> 03:48:47,338
He's bleeding,
and the skin is broken.

2058
03:48:47,422 --> 03:48:49,173
I gave him a few lashes.

2059
03:48:49,674 --> 03:48:53,010
His buttocks will sting for a few days,
but it's a healthy sting.

2060
03:48:53,345 --> 03:48:56,889
He'll think twice
before fabricating new lies,

2061
03:48:57,140 --> 03:49:00,518
or fantasies,
if that's the term you prefer.

2062
03:49:00,644 --> 03:49:01,977
And the humiliation?

2063
03:49:03,021 --> 03:49:07,566
Punishment given out of love
can never be humiliating

2064
03:49:07,692 --> 03:49:09,360
in the deeper sense.

2065
03:49:10,612 --> 03:49:12,571
Love and respect
have nothing in common,

2066
03:49:12,823 --> 03:49:14,865
and the language of love...

2067
03:49:15,992 --> 03:49:18,035
can be rather harsh.

2068
03:49:18,203 --> 03:49:19,703
You're one to speak of love.

2069
03:49:25,293 --> 03:49:27,378
You allow yourself
to be contemptuous.

2070
03:49:31,341 --> 03:49:33,717
Shall we end this conversation

2071
03:49:33,885 --> 03:49:35,052
and go to bed?

2072
03:49:35,220 --> 03:49:36,637
You locked him in the attic.

2073
03:49:36,763 --> 03:49:39,390
Of course.
He needed to be alone.

2074
03:49:39,558 --> 03:49:40,850
You know he's afraid of the dark.

2075
03:49:40,976 --> 03:49:43,727
The nights are bright
this time of year,

2076
03:49:43,854 --> 03:49:46,397
and those with a clear conscience
have nothing to fear.

2077
03:49:52,070 --> 03:49:54,071
I could kill you.

2078
03:50:00,245 --> 03:50:02,580
You'll harm the baby
with thoughts like that.

2079
03:50:04,791 --> 03:50:07,084
Our baby will never be born.

2080
03:50:09,337 --> 03:50:12,464
Be careful of what you say.

2081
03:50:15,010 --> 03:50:16,760
You don't frighten me.

2082
03:50:21,099 --> 03:50:23,267
I must frighten you, Emilie.

2083
03:50:24,269 --> 03:50:26,937
But I do so with a heavy heart,

2084
03:50:27,105 --> 03:50:29,607
since I love you in spite of everything.

2085
03:50:31,818 --> 03:50:34,111
You're not strong, Emilie.

2086
03:50:34,237 --> 03:50:36,363
The pregnancy is draining your strength.

2087
03:50:37,908 --> 03:50:39,366
From now on you'II stay in a room

2088
03:50:39,492 --> 03:50:41,410
that we'II make
as comfortable as possible.

2089
03:50:42,287 --> 03:50:44,622
Henrietta and my mother
will take turns looking after you.

2090
03:50:45,665 --> 03:50:48,417
For the time being,
your freedom will be somewhat limited.

2091
03:50:49,711 --> 03:50:53,214
But we must be very careful.

2092
03:50:59,596 --> 03:51:03,140
You should also know
that the slightest attempt to rebel

2093
03:51:03,558 --> 03:51:05,809
or contact the outside world

2094
03:51:05,936 --> 03:51:08,938
will affect your children's welfare.

2095
03:51:11,900 --> 03:51:16,487
By being irresponsible,
you've forced me to take responsibility,

2096
03:51:16,613 --> 03:51:18,822
not only for your children,
but also for you.

2097
03:51:19,824 --> 03:51:21,325
It's a heavy burden.

2098
03:51:22,661 --> 03:51:25,371
I feel a terrible Ioneliness.

2099
03:51:29,459 --> 03:51:31,502
I'm an ordinary man
with great faults,

2100
03:51:32,337 --> 03:51:34,922
but I exercise a powerful office

2101
03:51:35,674 --> 03:51:37,758
that always overshadows
the person holding it.

2102
03:51:37,884 --> 03:51:43,013
A man becomes a slave to such an office,
with no right to opinions of his own.

2103
03:55:11,306 --> 03:55:14,975
THE FIFTH ACT

2104
03:55:16,978 --> 03:55:20,814
DEMONS

2105
03:57:20,101 --> 03:57:22,311
Good day, Mr. Jacobi.

2106
03:57:23,104 --> 03:57:24,730
Good day, Miss Vergérus.

2107
03:57:24,939 --> 03:57:26,106
What is it?

2108
03:57:26,316 --> 03:57:28,400
Is His Grace -

2109
03:57:28,735 --> 03:57:30,610
He is not to be disturbed.

2110
03:57:31,112 --> 03:57:33,280
May I speak to his wife?

2111
03:57:33,489 --> 03:57:35,782
She is indisposed,
resting in her room -

2112
03:57:35,950 --> 03:57:37,326
And not to be disturbed.

2113
03:57:37,452 --> 03:57:39,536
My mother is out and I am busy.

2114
03:57:39,662 --> 03:57:42,789
His Grace might be annoyed if -

2115
03:57:42,957 --> 03:57:44,624
What is this concerning?

2116
03:57:45,376 --> 03:57:50,630
Some months ago,
His Grace proposed a business deal.

2117
03:57:51,924 --> 03:57:54,468
Really? I don't recall.

2118
03:57:54,635 --> 03:57:56,428
Of course not, Miss Vergérus.

2119
03:57:56,554 --> 03:58:00,432
His Grace is careful to spare
his family such trivial worries.

2120
03:58:00,558 --> 03:58:03,101
What worries of his
could concern you?

2121
03:58:03,978 --> 03:58:06,188
Please don't force me to be vulgar.

2122
03:58:06,647 --> 03:58:10,442
To be candid, Mr. Jacobi,
I find you unpleasant.

2123
03:58:10,735 --> 03:58:13,528
I've neither the time
nor the inclination to speak with you.

2124
03:58:14,030 --> 03:58:16,740
Good-bye, Mr. Jacobi.
- A pecuniary predicament.

2125
03:58:18,117 --> 03:58:19,368
I beg your pardon?

2126
03:58:19,494 --> 03:58:23,622
Your brother, His Grace,
was in a pecuniary predicament.

2127
03:58:23,748 --> 03:58:26,750
May I sit down?
- Not there! There.

2128
03:58:27,502 --> 03:58:29,669
In a peculiar way -
I don't know why -

2129
03:58:30,171 --> 03:58:32,130
I appreciate your straightforwardness.

2130
03:58:32,924 --> 03:58:35,717
And I do not appreciate
your fawning.

2131
03:58:36,969 --> 03:58:39,763
What business do you have
with my brother?

2132
03:58:40,431 --> 03:58:42,307
None at all, as far as I know.

2133
03:58:42,642 --> 03:58:44,434
I'm tired of your riddles.

2134
03:58:44,560 --> 03:58:46,269
Tell me what's on your mind and go.

2135
03:58:46,396 --> 03:58:50,232
I must speak to His Grace first.
It's a matter of money.

2136
03:58:51,192 --> 03:58:52,859
A lot of money.

2137
03:58:53,820 --> 03:58:55,695
Does my brother owe you money?

2138
03:58:55,905 --> 03:58:59,449
On the contrary.
It's like this:

2139
03:58:59,951 --> 03:59:02,327
In November
His Grace wanted to borrow money.

2140
03:59:02,453 --> 03:59:06,623
Regrettably, Jews have certain principles,
like never lending money to the clergy.

2141
03:59:06,749 --> 03:59:11,878
He suggested I should buy that chest
for a reasonable sum.

2142
03:59:12,171 --> 03:59:13,588
I declined.

2143
03:59:14,090 --> 03:59:16,007
So you declined.

2144
03:59:16,384 --> 03:59:19,886
Foolishly so,
since I've now changed my mind.

2145
03:59:20,012 --> 03:59:24,850
I'd like to buy that chest,
and at almost any price.

2146
03:59:25,560 --> 03:59:26,810
Almost.

2147
03:59:29,647 --> 03:59:31,440
I will get my brother.

2148
03:59:40,074 --> 03:59:42,409
I told you not to disturb me.

2149
03:59:42,535 --> 03:59:44,828
Mr. Jacobi wants to buy the chest.

2150
03:59:44,954 --> 03:59:47,038
That man hangs on like vermin!

2151
04:00:05,600 --> 04:00:08,518
Stay where you are.
I'll come get you in a few minutes.

2152
04:00:08,644 --> 04:00:10,312
Take your shoes off.

2153
04:00:17,904 --> 04:00:22,782
Forgive an old man's
unfortunate weakness, Your Grace.

2154
04:00:25,536 --> 04:00:28,705
- You wish to buy the chest?
- Yes.

2155
04:00:28,956 --> 04:00:30,624
For how much?

2156
04:00:30,875 --> 04:00:32,667
Here is the sum.

2157
04:00:40,635 --> 04:00:42,802
It seems you've changed your mind.

2158
04:00:42,970 --> 04:00:44,971
I may have an interested buyer.

2159
04:00:48,476 --> 04:00:52,938
- I'm being cheated, of course.
- You're free to say no.

2160
04:00:54,106 --> 04:00:56,566
- Do you have the money with you?
- The money?

2161
04:00:56,817 --> 04:00:59,819
The money!
Of course, Your Grace.

2162
04:00:59,987 --> 04:01:01,863
I have large bills right here.

2163
04:01:02,448 --> 04:01:04,157
Let me see.

2164
04:01:05,868 --> 04:01:09,579
Yes, here they are.

2165
04:01:11,749 --> 04:01:14,501
- Give me the money.
- Of course.

2166
04:01:15,378 --> 04:01:19,422
If I may have Your Grace's name
on the contract?

2167
04:01:22,635 --> 04:01:24,886
Forgive me if I retire.

2168
04:01:25,012 --> 04:01:27,180
I shall miss you, Miss Vergérus.

2169
04:01:27,348 --> 04:01:30,433
Do not take anything
that is not your due.

2170
04:01:31,477 --> 04:01:34,604
Suspicions recoil
on those who harbor them.

2171
04:02:21,235 --> 04:02:25,363
Your Grace will want to ensure
that I'm not taking more than my due.

2172
04:02:25,489 --> 04:02:26,906
That's quite all right.

2173
04:02:27,074 --> 04:02:30,994
I just wanted to return
the signed contract.

2174
04:02:31,787 --> 04:02:33,413
Please have a seat.

2175
04:02:34,165 --> 04:02:37,000
What would you say
about that painting?

2176
04:02:37,501 --> 04:02:39,294
A beautiful and valuable work.

2177
04:02:39,420 --> 04:02:41,463
Would it interest you?

2178
04:02:41,589 --> 04:02:44,382
My resources are regrettably
a bit strained at present.

2179
04:02:45,968 --> 04:02:49,054
How is your wife?
- It's kind of you to inquire.

2180
04:02:49,597 --> 04:02:53,516
She is indisposed.
This sudden heat disagrees with her.

2181
04:02:54,018 --> 04:02:57,479
- May I pay my respects?
- Unfortunately not.

2182
04:02:57,772 --> 04:02:59,105
I understand.

2183
04:02:59,273 --> 04:03:02,067
Here is a letter for her
from old Mrs. Ekdahl.

2184
04:03:03,110 --> 04:03:05,487
- I shall give it to her.
- You're too kind.

2185
04:03:05,613 --> 04:03:09,658
Filthy Jewish swine!
You damned, filthy Jewish swine!

2186
04:03:09,784 --> 04:03:11,660
You thought you could cheat me.

2187
04:03:11,786 --> 04:03:17,749
You'll regret this,
you repulsive, hooknosed bastard!

2188
04:03:18,334 --> 04:03:19,542
Calm down!

2189
04:03:19,669 --> 04:03:21,961
That swine is trying
to steal my children!

2190
04:03:22,088 --> 04:03:25,340
He can't.
I have the key to the nursery.

2191
04:03:47,738 --> 04:03:49,447
Don't touch them!

2192
04:04:10,136 --> 04:04:11,678
Come on, quickly!

2193
04:05:00,436 --> 04:05:01,895
Come here.

2194
04:05:03,898 --> 04:05:06,149
First and foremost,
let's have something to eat.

2195
04:05:08,194 --> 04:05:09,861
This is my nephew, Aron.

2196
04:05:12,823 --> 04:05:14,324
Let's go to the table.

2197
04:05:17,077 --> 04:05:18,745
I'd like to sleep.

2198
04:05:22,249 --> 04:05:24,125
Our guests are tired.

2199
04:05:25,085 --> 04:05:28,087
Have you tidied the room
and made the beds?

2200
04:05:28,214 --> 04:05:30,423
I've done all you asked, Uncle.

2201
04:05:52,947 --> 04:05:56,115
This is Aron's puppet theater.

2202
04:05:57,701 --> 04:06:00,620
If you ask him nicely,
he may give a performance.

2203
04:06:11,465 --> 04:06:15,635
Behind this door lives
my nephew Ismael. He's sick.

2204
04:06:16,345 --> 04:06:20,890
The door must always be kept shut.
Remember that, both of you.

2205
04:06:21,600 --> 04:06:24,060
Sometimes he sings, even at night.

2206
04:06:24,854 --> 04:06:28,398
It's nothing to worry about.
You'II get used to it.

2207
04:06:30,317 --> 04:06:34,028
Mind the steps, Fanny,
so you don't trip.

2208
04:06:34,780 --> 04:06:36,573
Now down this hallway.

2209
04:06:36,699 --> 04:06:38,741
It's a bit cold and damp,

2210
04:06:38,868 --> 04:06:42,453
because we don't dare light a fire
or open the windows.

2211
04:06:43,122 --> 04:06:45,748
Straight ahead,

2212
04:06:45,875 --> 04:06:49,002
and then through that little door.

2213
04:06:49,670 --> 04:06:51,170
It's not so unusual.

2214
04:06:53,841 --> 04:06:56,384
This will be your home
for the time being.

2215
04:06:56,510 --> 04:06:58,177
I hope you'll like it.

2216
04:06:58,470 --> 04:07:00,013
Go to bed now.

2217
04:07:00,598 --> 04:07:02,056
Good night, Fanny.

2218
04:07:02,892 --> 04:07:04,350
Good night, Alexander.

2219
04:07:05,686 --> 04:07:08,730
Lock the door at night
and don't open it for anyone.

2220
04:07:09,732 --> 04:07:11,983
Don't forget to say your prayers.
- Don't go.

2221
04:07:13,861 --> 04:07:16,613
You want me to stay?
Then I'II sit here.

2222
04:07:23,495 --> 04:07:25,246
I'll go and see to Ismael.

2223
04:07:30,502 --> 04:07:33,588
My name is Aron.
Ismael is my brother.

2224
04:07:33,714 --> 04:07:35,673
Our parents died
when we were small.

2225
04:07:38,218 --> 04:07:39,427
Good night.

2226
04:07:50,773 --> 04:07:52,523
What kind of book is that?

2227
04:07:52,650 --> 04:07:58,279
It's a book of stories, thoughts,
words of wisdom and prayers.

2228
04:07:59,907 --> 04:08:01,574
It's written in Hebrew.

2229
04:08:01,742 --> 04:08:03,159
You understand that language?

2230
04:08:07,331 --> 04:08:09,374
- Shall I read you something?
- Yes, please.

2231
04:08:09,667 --> 04:08:11,250
Uncle Isak?

2232
04:08:12,753 --> 04:08:15,630
Are you sure His Grace
can't come and get us?

2233
04:08:16,131 --> 04:08:18,257
You can put your mind at ease.

2234
04:08:18,425 --> 04:08:19,592
Come on, read.

2235
04:08:19,760 --> 04:08:22,470
It may be a bit choppy,
since I have to translate.

2236
04:08:26,308 --> 04:08:30,478
A young man journeys
down an endless road

2237
04:08:30,604 --> 04:08:32,897
in the company of many others.

2238
04:08:35,109 --> 04:08:39,696
The road leads across a rocky plain
where nothing grows.

2239
04:08:41,699 --> 04:08:45,034
The sun's fire burns
from morning to evening.

2240
04:08:45,619 --> 04:08:49,664
They can't find shade
or coolness anywhere.

2241
04:08:51,291 --> 04:08:55,628
A harrowing wind stirs up
huge dust clouds.

2242
04:08:58,465 --> 04:09:03,011
The youth is driven forward
by an incomprehensible anxiety...

2243
04:09:04,471 --> 04:09:07,223
and tormented by a scorching thirst.

2244
04:09:10,185 --> 04:09:13,771
Sometimes he asks himself
or one of his traveling companions

2245
04:09:14,523 --> 04:09:17,066
about the goal of their pilgrimage.

2246
04:09:18,861 --> 04:09:21,988
But the answer
is uncertain and tentative.

2247
04:09:24,324 --> 04:09:30,038
He himself has forgotten
why he ever set out on his journey.

2248
04:09:32,124 --> 04:09:34,751
He's also forgotten his native land...

2249
04:09:36,211 --> 04:09:38,588
and the journey's final destination.

2250
04:09:41,592 --> 04:09:45,136
Suddenly, one evening
he finds himself standing in a forest.

2251
04:09:46,638 --> 04:09:48,681
Dusk sets in and all is quiet.

2252
04:09:48,807 --> 04:09:52,143
Perhaps the evening wind
sighs through the tall trees.

2253
04:09:54,396 --> 04:09:56,439
He stands amazed...

2254
04:09:57,691 --> 04:09:59,942
but also anxious and suspicious.

2255
04:10:02,029 --> 04:10:03,529
He's all alone...

2256
04:10:05,074 --> 04:10:07,283
and he discovers
his hearing is weak,

2257
04:10:08,535 --> 04:10:13,623
since his ears are inflamed
from the merciless light of day.

2258
04:10:15,667 --> 04:10:19,295
His mouth and throat are parched
from the long pilgrimage.

2259
04:10:21,340 --> 04:10:23,299
His lips are cracked,

2260
04:10:23,425 --> 04:10:27,345
pressed together
around curses and harsh words.

2261
04:10:30,224 --> 04:10:34,352
So he doesn't hear
the ripple of flowing water

2262
04:10:36,146 --> 04:10:39,774
and doesn't notice
its reflection in the dusk.

2263
04:10:42,277 --> 04:10:46,864
He stands deaf and blind
at the edge of the spring...

2264
04:10:48,659 --> 04:10:51,536
unaware of its existence.

2265
04:10:54,248 --> 04:10:57,917
Like a sleepwalker he wanders unaware
between the sparkling pools.

2266
04:10:59,670 --> 04:11:05,591
His blind skill is remarkable,
and soon he's back onto the road...

2267
04:11:06,802 --> 04:11:10,221
in the burning, shadowless light.

2268
04:11:14,643 --> 04:11:18,938
One night by the campfire
he's seated near an old man

2269
04:11:19,648 --> 04:11:23,025
who's telling some children
about the forests and springs.

2270
04:11:25,863 --> 04:11:28,865
The youth recalls
what he's been through,

2271
04:11:29,908 --> 04:11:32,618
but faintly and indistinctly...

2272
04:11:34,121 --> 04:11:35,454
as in a dream.

2273
04:11:37,457 --> 04:11:41,169
He turns to the old man,
skeptical yet courteous, and asks,

2274
04:11:42,296 --> 04:11:44,547
"Where does all this water come from?"

2275
04:11:46,300 --> 04:11:51,179
"It comes from a mountain whose peak
is covered by a mighty cloud."

2276
04:11:52,806 --> 04:11:54,974
"What kind of cloud?" the youth asks.

2277
04:11:57,561 --> 04:11:59,312
The old man answers,

2278
04:12:01,231 --> 04:12:07,069
"Every man carries within him
hopes, fears and longings.

2279
04:12:09,031 --> 04:12:13,409
Every man shouts out his despair
or bears it in his mind.

2280
04:12:15,412 --> 04:12:18,331
Some pray to a particular god.

2281
04:12:20,292 --> 04:12:23,377
Others address their cries to the void.

2282
04:12:26,423 --> 04:12:30,885
This despair, this hope...

2283
04:12:32,554 --> 04:12:36,098
this dream of deliverance,
all these cries, all these tears

2284
04:12:36,225 --> 04:12:39,393
are gathered over thousands
and thousands of years...

2285
04:12:41,063 --> 04:12:46,025
and condense into an unmeasurable cloud
around a high mountain.

2286
04:12:48,612 --> 04:12:51,989
Out of the cloud
rain flows down the mountain...

2287
04:12:54,368 --> 04:12:59,538
forming the streams and rivers
that flow through the great forests.

2288
04:13:02,167 --> 04:13:06,212
That's how the springs are formed
where you can quench your thirst...

2289
04:13:07,756 --> 04:13:10,883
wash your badly burnt face...

2290
04:13:12,844 --> 04:13:15,680
cool your blistered feet.

2291
04:13:18,642 --> 04:13:23,229
Everybody has at some time heard of
the mountain, the cloud and the springs...

2292
04:13:25,399 --> 04:13:31,570
but most people anxiously remain
on the dusty road in the blazing light."

2293
04:13:33,573 --> 04:13:37,910
"Why do they stay there?"
Asks the youth in great astonishment.

2294
04:13:40,247 --> 04:13:42,415
"I certainly don't know,"
replies the old man.

2295
04:13:44,584 --> 04:13:46,961
"Perhaps they've convinced
themselves and each other

2296
04:13:47,087 --> 04:13:50,172
that they'II reach
their unknown destination by evening."

2297
04:13:53,135 --> 04:13:57,346
"What unknown destination?"
Asks the young man.

2298
04:14:00,434 --> 04:14:02,476
The old man shrugs his shoulders.

2299
04:14:05,105 --> 04:14:08,274
"In all probability
the destination does not exist.

2300
04:14:09,776 --> 04:14:12,403
It's deception or imagination.

2301
04:14:15,449 --> 04:14:18,868
I myself am on my way
to the forests and the springs.

2302
04:14:21,288 --> 04:14:23,956
I was there once when I was young...

2303
04:14:25,625 --> 04:14:28,127
and now I'm trying
to find my way back.

2304
04:14:30,672 --> 04:14:32,715
It's not easy, let me tell you."

2305
04:14:37,304 --> 04:14:40,431
The next morning
the youth set out with the old man

2306
04:14:40,557 --> 04:14:46,354
to seek the mountain, the cloud,
the forests and the rippling springs.

2307
04:16:14,860 --> 04:16:16,735
Shall we have a seat?

2308
04:16:19,239 --> 04:16:21,323
May I tempt you with a glass of sherry?
- No, thank you.

2309
04:16:21,450 --> 04:16:22,575
No.

2310
04:16:23,743 --> 04:16:27,455
- An almond cookie? My sister's specialty.
- No, thank you.

2311
04:16:28,206 --> 04:16:29,457
Not that either.

2312
04:16:39,468 --> 04:16:41,260
I want the children back.

2313
04:16:41,386 --> 04:16:44,263
This is a small town,
and tongues will soon be wagging.

2314
04:16:46,308 --> 04:16:51,187
I fear you've misunderstood
the reason for our visit.

2315
04:16:52,939 --> 04:16:56,275
We're here on behalf of the family

2316
04:16:56,401 --> 04:16:58,903
to ask that you set
Emilie and the children free.

2317
04:17:00,238 --> 04:17:03,657
We can't say with certainty
that we know what has occurred.

2318
04:17:04,659 --> 04:17:07,578
We only know that our dear Emilie
is extremely unhappy

2319
04:17:08,205 --> 04:17:10,122
and that the children hate
the bishop's palace.

2320
04:17:10,290 --> 04:17:13,167
We certainly understand

2321
04:17:14,211 --> 04:17:17,588
that divorce is a painful step

2322
04:17:17,714 --> 04:17:20,549
for a highly placed servant
of the church,

2323
04:17:21,801 --> 04:17:24,678
and we'd like to make
appropriate compensation

2324
04:17:24,804 --> 04:17:26,555
for your painful loss.

2325
04:17:27,641 --> 04:17:29,517
I've spoken with my mother,

2326
04:17:29,643 --> 04:17:34,855
and we're ready to place
a considerable sum at your disposal,

2327
04:17:34,981 --> 04:17:38,317
which you may, of course, use...

2328
04:17:40,820 --> 04:17:43,531
for charity, a foundation,

2329
04:17:44,157 --> 04:17:46,909
or some other purpose
close to your heart.

2330
04:17:48,078 --> 04:17:53,541
We agree that everything must be
handled with utmost discretion,

2331
04:17:54,000 --> 04:17:58,337
and my mother is willing to take
Emilie and the children to Italy

2332
04:17:59,381 --> 04:18:01,465
and remain there for at least a year.

2333
04:18:03,176 --> 04:18:06,345
Let me first say
that I fully appreciate

2334
04:18:06,930 --> 04:18:11,267
the respect and generosity the Ekdahls
extend to me in this difficult hour.

2335
04:18:12,227 --> 04:18:15,563
At the same time,
it's necessary, though painful,

2336
04:18:16,815 --> 04:18:18,857
for me to speak very clearly.

2337
04:18:20,735 --> 04:18:23,279
The children have been abducted
from their home.

2338
04:18:24,239 --> 04:18:27,700
They must unconditionally and without
delay be returned to their legal parents.

2339
04:18:27,826 --> 04:18:30,995
Every delay will cause all of us -

2340
04:18:31,538 --> 04:18:33,789
not least their mother -

2341
04:18:33,915 --> 04:18:35,791
unspeakable suffering.

2342
04:18:37,877 --> 04:18:41,046
When the children are returned,
I'll be prepared to listen

2343
04:18:41,214 --> 04:18:43,382
to any proposals
the Ekdahl family may have.

2344
04:18:44,009 --> 04:18:46,719
But to avoid
any further misunderstandings...

2345
04:18:48,013 --> 04:18:50,723
I must make it clear that a divorce...

2346
04:18:52,642 --> 04:18:54,935
is absolutely out of the question.

2347
04:18:56,229 --> 04:19:01,609
I'm very grateful
for your precise and clear standpoint.

2348
04:19:03,570 --> 04:19:07,197
But I'm obliged to mention
that the children will never...

2349
04:19:08,408 --> 04:19:12,745
be returned to the bishop's palace
to be subjected to the suffering

2350
04:19:13,330 --> 04:19:15,247
that up till now has befallen them.

2351
04:19:15,999 --> 04:19:21,378
Perhaps I should add that on this point
the Ekdahls are in complete agreement.

2352
04:19:22,047 --> 04:19:24,381
The matter is therefore
not open to discussion.

2353
04:19:25,550 --> 04:19:27,509
The children are part of our family,

2354
04:19:28,178 --> 04:19:31,221
and we therefore consider ourselves
responsible for their well-being...

2355
04:19:32,390 --> 04:19:33,766
and development.

2356
04:19:35,935 --> 04:19:37,436
It grieves me...

2357
04:19:38,897 --> 04:19:41,565
that the Ekdahl family
should be dictating conditions.

2358
04:19:42,942 --> 04:19:45,944
Especially since, as their stepfather,
I have the law on my side.

2359
04:19:47,280 --> 04:19:49,490
And furthermore,
as a representative of the church,

2360
04:19:50,533 --> 04:19:52,660
I have the moral advantage.

2361
04:19:55,288 --> 04:19:58,957
But we have the children,
my dear brother.

2362
04:19:59,501 --> 04:20:03,379
I'm glad you're able to laugh
in this awkward situation.

2363
04:20:07,342 --> 04:20:10,844
Perhaps legal proceedings
and police action will be unavoidable.

2364
04:20:10,970 --> 04:20:14,014
I doubt it, my dear Edvard.

2365
04:20:14,891 --> 04:20:17,559
You'd rather shit in your pants
than suffer the disgrace

2366
04:20:17,686 --> 04:20:20,854
of the parish hags
whistling through their false teeth.

2367
04:20:21,147 --> 04:20:25,693
You may well have morality and the law
on your side, old man,

2368
04:20:25,819 --> 04:20:28,320
but bear in mind
that I'm in league with immorality,

2369
04:20:28,613 --> 04:20:31,031
and even were you to win in court,

2370
04:20:31,324 --> 04:20:33,033
we who side with immorality

2371
04:20:33,159 --> 04:20:37,496
will have spread so many
credible rumors about your person,

2372
04:20:37,789 --> 04:20:40,124
your way of life, your household,

2373
04:20:40,250 --> 04:20:41,875
your sister, your servants,

2374
04:20:42,001 --> 04:20:45,170
your sanity, your sexual excesses,

2375
04:20:45,338 --> 04:20:48,799
your phony hair, your hypocrisy,
your hypochondria,

2376
04:20:49,008 --> 04:20:53,262
and your lack of decency
that you'll be forever forced to preach

2377
04:20:53,638 --> 04:20:57,433
to Huguenots, hooligans and Eskimos!

2378
04:20:58,184 --> 04:21:00,769
I'm not saying this to frighten you,
my esteemed friend.

2379
04:21:02,355 --> 04:21:04,940
I only wish to lay
all the cards on the table.

2380
04:21:07,193 --> 04:21:09,445
So let me see you listen to reason.

2381
04:21:09,571 --> 04:21:11,196
If you have any, that is.

2382
04:21:13,324 --> 04:21:15,784
Your clownish antics are amusing.

2383
04:21:15,910 --> 04:21:18,537
I'd be inclined to laugh
if your babble didn't contain

2384
04:21:18,705 --> 04:21:22,124
what I would call
a real and material threat.

2385
04:21:22,250 --> 04:21:25,169
Let me tell you something,

2386
04:21:25,378 --> 04:21:28,630
my fine lord bishop,

2387
04:21:29,215 --> 04:21:30,966
something you might not understand.

2388
04:21:31,092 --> 04:21:33,594
I can see through you.

2389
04:21:34,012 --> 04:21:36,221
You're a cad
of monumental proportions!

2390
04:21:36,389 --> 04:21:40,058
Shut up, Gustav Adolf!
Think of your blood pressure!

2391
04:21:43,730 --> 04:21:45,856
I must apologize, my dear Edvard.

2392
04:21:46,483 --> 04:21:50,152
Even if we have differing views
in what seems to be an irresolvable conflict,

2393
04:21:50,278 --> 04:21:53,071
we must behave like civilized beings.

2394
04:21:54,616 --> 04:21:57,201
I disassociate myself entirely from
Gustav Adolf's expressions and attitudes

2395
04:21:57,327 --> 04:22:01,663
and assure you that he represents
no one but himself.

2396
04:22:02,290 --> 04:22:06,084
He certainly does not voice
the family's opinion.

2397
04:22:18,139 --> 04:22:20,432
My esteemed brother must forgive me.

2398
04:22:21,518 --> 04:22:23,101
A thousand apologies.

2399
04:22:23,269 --> 04:22:26,396
I'm a boor -
at least that's what my wife says.

2400
04:22:27,440 --> 04:22:30,776
I have no eye
for people's inner qualities.

2401
04:22:32,278 --> 04:22:35,405
I drink too much.
I'm embarrassed. I apologize.

2402
04:22:35,532 --> 04:22:37,908
We'II say no more about it.

2403
04:22:38,576 --> 04:22:42,120
I'm prepared to listen
to an honest man's honest opinion,

2404
04:22:42,247 --> 04:22:44,790
even if he is a bit...

2405
04:22:45,583 --> 04:22:47,084
brusque.

2406
04:22:49,671 --> 04:22:52,881
A glass of sherry?
I assure you it's quite good.

2407
04:22:58,137 --> 04:22:59,471
Thank you very much.

2408
04:23:07,146 --> 04:23:08,564
I'm awfully sorry.

2409
04:23:10,149 --> 04:23:14,945
I'm so fond of that silly Emilie,
that silly little creature.

2410
04:23:15,738 --> 04:23:19,616
We love her. The whole family loves her.
Isn't that so, Carl?

2411
04:23:20,285 --> 04:23:24,496
And when our brother Oscar died,
we didn't care for her sufficiently.

2412
04:23:25,373 --> 04:23:27,833
We have much to blame ourselves for.

2413
04:23:29,502 --> 04:23:32,796
One can be so damned slack
and self-centered.

2414
04:23:32,922 --> 04:23:34,673
I said that to Alma this morning.

2415
04:23:34,799 --> 04:23:37,342
If we hadn't been so slack
and self-centered,

2416
04:23:37,468 --> 04:23:40,679
this would never have -

2417
04:23:52,692 --> 04:23:57,154
I don't think we can reach an agreement
under present circumstances.

2418
04:24:01,200 --> 04:24:06,538
Let us consider our confidential
and frank conversation

2419
04:24:06,706 --> 04:24:08,290
as a cautious exploration.

2420
04:24:08,541 --> 04:24:12,920
I fear I do not share
your cautious optimism.

2421
04:24:15,757 --> 04:24:17,591
I consider
our negotiations terminated...

2422
04:24:19,385 --> 04:24:23,388
and feel compelled to make
my standpoint quite clear.

2423
04:24:25,892 --> 04:24:28,560
The children must be returned
to their home within 12 hours.

2424
04:24:29,228 --> 04:24:32,648
Otherwise I'll be forced,
though it conflicts with my principles,

2425
04:24:33,900 --> 04:24:36,610
to report the matter to the police
and the public prosecutor.

2426
04:24:39,489 --> 04:24:42,866
Is it conceivable
that if the children were returned,

2427
04:24:44,077 --> 04:24:49,247
we could begin informal talks
about their future relations with us?

2428
04:24:49,415 --> 04:24:54,419
I'm a believer
in firm rules and principles...

2429
04:24:56,214 --> 04:24:58,131
a fact that in no way conflicts

2430
04:24:58,257 --> 04:25:00,384
with my sincere
and passionate love of freedom.

2431
04:25:01,928 --> 04:25:04,930
May I understand your statement

2432
04:25:05,056 --> 04:25:09,267
as an indirect promise
of future discussions

2433
04:25:09,435 --> 04:25:12,604
regarding the sensitive question
of Emilie's and the children's

2434
04:25:12,730 --> 04:25:14,272
freedom of movement?

2435
04:25:21,698 --> 04:25:23,615
Disintegration in our lives...

2436
04:25:26,244 --> 04:25:30,330
is due in large part
to broken ties between people...

2437
04:25:31,666 --> 04:25:35,961
who otherwise have the capacity
to respect and love each other.

2438
04:25:40,341 --> 04:25:42,718
A cruel
and incomprehensible mystery.

2439
04:25:42,844 --> 04:25:44,469
To think that a man like me,

2440
04:25:44,595 --> 04:25:46,972
almost 220 pounds,

2441
04:25:47,098 --> 04:25:49,933
with a fully grown beard
and a developed mind...

2442
04:25:51,185 --> 04:25:54,271
should have to sit here
on this silly, uncomfortable chair

2443
04:25:54,397 --> 04:25:57,149
and listen
to this unmitigated hypocrite.

2444
04:25:57,275 --> 04:25:59,860
"Disintegration in our lives!"

2445
04:25:59,986 --> 04:26:01,987
Kiss me where my back
changes its name!

2446
04:26:02,155 --> 04:26:04,322
You shut up, Carl -
Shut up! -

2447
04:26:04,490 --> 04:26:08,160
while I tell this spiritual masturbator
what we have up our sleeves.

2448
04:26:08,411 --> 04:26:09,703
Listen to me!

2449
04:26:10,329 --> 04:26:13,665
I'll tell you something,
Edvard Vergérus.

2450
04:26:15,168 --> 04:26:18,503
I've acquired your promissory notes.

2451
04:26:19,839 --> 04:26:21,506
You didn't know that, did you?

2452
04:26:22,341 --> 04:26:23,592
Yes, my friend.

2453
04:26:24,677 --> 04:26:28,513
110,000 kronor in debts.

2454
04:26:30,266 --> 04:26:32,851
So I'II be dictating conditions now.

2455
04:26:34,854 --> 04:26:36,271
Turning pale now, are you?

2456
04:26:37,356 --> 04:26:41,026
The holy man's looking pale, eh, Carl?

2457
04:26:41,736 --> 04:26:44,362
I'd say his nose even grew a bit too.

2458
04:26:48,868 --> 04:26:53,789
You're a special kind of bully,
Edvard Vergérus.

2459
04:26:53,915 --> 04:26:58,877
One thing I've learned in my profession
is to recognize the smell of a bully,

2460
04:26:59,545 --> 04:27:01,588
even if he wears a cassock.

2461
04:27:04,050 --> 04:27:06,301
And I know how bullies
should be treated.

2462
04:27:06,719 --> 04:27:08,261
They must be bullied!

2463
04:27:08,387 --> 04:27:10,847
Emilie is to have her divorce,

2464
04:27:11,224 --> 04:27:15,143
or I'll declare His Holiness bankrupt!

2465
04:27:42,672 --> 04:27:43,880
Idiot.

2466
04:27:44,006 --> 04:27:45,090
What?

2467
04:27:45,258 --> 04:27:47,717
I said idiot. You're an idiot.

2468
04:27:48,511 --> 04:27:51,471
I thought it honorable to tell him
he doesn't have a chance.

2469
04:27:51,597 --> 04:27:54,057
I get so tired of you sometimes,
Gustav Adolf.

2470
04:27:54,433 --> 04:27:56,977
Really? What stupid thing
have I done now?

2471
04:27:57,562 --> 04:27:58,895
You'll soon see.

2472
04:28:00,106 --> 04:28:04,151
A moment ago we spoke of the advantage
of putting our cards on the table.

2473
04:28:05,862 --> 04:28:08,572
I beg to return
to that metaphor shortly.

2474
04:28:09,407 --> 04:28:11,616
To Mr. Ekdahl I'd like to say...

2475
04:28:13,494 --> 04:28:15,245
that I pity him.

2476
04:28:16,956 --> 04:28:21,251
He has a poor opinion of the world
and a simplistic view of people.

2477
04:28:22,795 --> 04:28:24,838
He suffers from
the widespread misconception

2478
04:28:24,922 --> 04:28:27,048
that man is ruled by his needs.

2479
04:28:27,925 --> 04:28:32,220
He believes that everything
can be bought and sold.

2480
04:28:35,266 --> 04:28:39,644
Mr. Ekdahl is the son of one
of the country's greatest artists.

2481
04:28:40,771 --> 04:28:44,691
Despite this he has grasped
little or nothing...

2482
04:28:45,568 --> 04:28:48,904
of the spirit's unlimited power

2483
04:28:50,031 --> 04:28:51,489
over matter.

2484
04:28:54,952 --> 04:28:56,703
He is a wretched Caliban,

2485
04:28:57,246 --> 04:28:59,998
groping with clumsy hands
for his dull tools.

2486
04:29:00,416 --> 04:29:04,085
I pity him and feel
sincere compassion for him.

2487
04:29:06,714 --> 04:29:10,675
My esteemed Carl, I thank you for
a respectful and dignified conversation.

2488
04:29:12,845 --> 04:29:15,013
I regret we have not
come to an agreement.

2489
04:29:16,849 --> 04:29:19,517
Try sometime to tell your brother -

2490
04:29:22,480 --> 04:29:25,023
No, he would never understand...

2491
04:29:26,275 --> 04:29:29,361
that there are people
who have no needs...

2492
04:29:30,529 --> 04:29:32,697
who are indifferent to money...

2493
04:29:34,283 --> 04:29:36,201
who dismiss the world's luxuries,

2494
04:29:36,369 --> 04:29:38,328
who happily allow themselves
to be slandered

2495
04:29:38,454 --> 04:29:42,457
because their conscience is clear

2496
04:29:43,292 --> 04:29:45,377
before God the Almighty.

2497
04:29:49,048 --> 04:29:53,927
Now, to return to our game of cards,
which Mr. Ekdahl spoke of so wittily.

2498
04:29:54,470 --> 04:29:59,224
Allow me to play the last card.

2499
04:30:00,226 --> 04:30:01,726
Excuse me for a moment.

2500
04:30:07,733 --> 04:30:11,778
That man is the devil himself!

2501
04:30:11,904 --> 04:30:14,739
Have you ever seen
such a cold-blooded scoundrel?

2502
04:30:14,865 --> 04:30:17,200
- If you hadn't behaved like -
- An idiot.

2503
04:30:17,326 --> 04:30:20,036
I admit it, and I'm sick about it.

2504
04:30:20,162 --> 04:30:22,539
No, that's not the word.
I'm terribly sorry.

2505
04:30:22,665 --> 04:30:25,083
- Be quiet, he's coming. Shut up!
- I'll shut up.

2506
04:30:28,462 --> 04:30:30,255
Dear, dear Gustav Adolf.

2507
04:30:30,423 --> 04:30:31,589
Dear Carl.

2508
04:30:32,258 --> 04:30:35,802
I can't begin to express my gratitude
for your care and affection,

2509
04:30:36,304 --> 04:30:38,596
but unfortunately
you've misunderstood.

2510
04:30:39,307 --> 04:30:42,392
Isak Jacobi took it upon himself
to abduct the children.

2511
04:30:43,185 --> 04:30:45,103
It's terrible and unbelievable.

2512
04:30:46,647 --> 04:30:48,648
It's nice and safe here.

2513
04:30:49,150 --> 04:30:51,985
Edvard is good to us,
and we're very happy.

2514
04:30:53,362 --> 04:30:55,572
I implore you with all my heart

2515
04:30:55,698 --> 04:30:57,282
to bring back my children.

2516
04:30:58,367 --> 04:31:00,452
It's true that I've been
anxious and unhappy.

2517
04:31:01,203 --> 04:31:03,955
It's true that I went
and talked to Helena.

2518
04:31:04,665 --> 04:31:08,418
It's true the children had difficulty
adjusting to their new surroundings.

2519
04:31:08,753 --> 04:31:12,422
It's true we live a stricter
and more serious life than at home.

2520
04:31:15,176 --> 04:31:16,801
But I'm happy and safe.

2521
04:31:17,470 --> 04:31:19,387
Edvard is goodness itself.

2522
04:31:21,223 --> 04:31:22,724
You must believe me.

2523
04:31:24,018 --> 04:31:26,269
I implore you with all my heart:

2524
04:31:27,605 --> 04:31:29,856
Bring back my children!

2525
04:31:30,358 --> 04:31:32,817
I cannot live without them!

2526
04:31:34,987 --> 04:31:38,740
Dear friends, do as I say.

2527
04:31:40,076 --> 04:31:43,328
It's all a terrible misunderstanding.

2528
04:31:56,592 --> 04:31:58,009
Farewell, gentlemen.

2529
04:32:04,683 --> 04:32:06,518
I have to pee.

2530
04:32:11,774 --> 04:32:14,025
Damn, there's no chamber pot.

2531
04:32:17,321 --> 04:32:19,948
It won't be easy
to find the toilet in the dark.

2532
04:32:32,628 --> 04:32:34,712
I hope there aren't any ghosts.

2533
04:33:22,094 --> 04:33:24,512
Damn, I think I've lost my way.

2534
04:33:53,584 --> 04:33:56,461
Now I'm lost for sure.

2535
04:34:20,861 --> 04:34:24,030
It's not my fault
it's all gone wrong.

2536
04:34:25,658 --> 04:34:29,202
I can't leave you.
I just can't.

2537
04:34:29,328 --> 04:34:32,038
It would be better
if you'd take off for heaven.

2538
04:34:32,164 --> 04:34:33,831
You can't help us anyway.

2539
04:34:46,679 --> 04:34:51,266
I lived my whole life
with you children and Emilie.

2540
04:34:52,726 --> 04:34:54,894
Death makes no difference.

2541
04:34:59,984 --> 04:35:02,193
What is it, Alexander?

2542
04:35:03,737 --> 04:35:07,407
Why can't you go to God
and tell him to kill the bishop?

2543
04:35:09,368 --> 04:35:13,454
Or doesn't God give a damn about you,
or any of us?

2544
04:35:15,332 --> 04:35:18,418
Have you even seen God
on the other side?

2545
04:35:20,379 --> 04:35:23,673
Not a bastard
has a thought in his head.

2546
04:35:26,010 --> 04:35:27,844
Idiots, the whole bunch of 'em.

2547
04:35:35,060 --> 04:35:38,605
You must be gentle with people.

2548
04:36:00,419 --> 04:36:02,253
Aren't you coming to bed?

2549
04:36:04,256 --> 04:36:06,257
The clock has struck 4:00.

2550
04:36:06,508 --> 04:36:08,051
I can't sleep.

2551
04:36:11,013 --> 04:36:12,388
Neither can I.

2552
04:36:12,514 --> 04:36:17,393
Elsa's very sick.
We ought to send for the doctor.

2553
04:36:17,519 --> 04:36:19,437
He's coming in the morning.

2554
04:36:19,605 --> 04:36:21,773
What are you drinking?
- Hot broth.

2555
04:36:21,940 --> 04:36:24,108
It helps against insomnia.
- May I?

2556
04:36:32,618 --> 04:36:34,077
Be my guest.

2557
04:36:35,287 --> 04:36:37,246
Can't you forgive me?

2558
04:36:37,748 --> 04:36:41,668
I'm staying with you, aren't I?

2559
04:36:45,339 --> 04:36:47,799
I don't understand
this sudden yielding.

2560
04:36:48,175 --> 04:36:49,967
Drink while it's hot.

2561
04:36:58,477 --> 04:37:01,521
- You insist that the children return?
- Yes.

2562
04:37:01,647 --> 04:37:03,648
In that case, it's hopeless.

2563
04:37:03,774 --> 04:37:06,984
I don't care if it's hopeless.
I care only for what is right.

2564
04:37:08,237 --> 04:37:10,071
Isn't that Elsa calling?

2565
04:37:13,909 --> 04:37:16,828
Stay here. I'll see to her.

2566
04:37:31,593 --> 04:37:33,219
Can I help you, Aunt?

2567
04:37:33,470 --> 04:37:35,221
It's so dark.

2568
04:38:05,085 --> 04:38:06,878
What time is it?

2569
04:38:08,338 --> 04:38:10,214
Almost half past 4:00.

2570
04:38:10,382 --> 04:38:11,799
It's been a long night.

2571
04:38:12,760 --> 04:38:14,635
Try to get some sleep.

2572
04:38:14,928 --> 04:38:16,721
My legs hurt.

2573
04:38:18,557 --> 04:38:20,308
They're swollen and aching.

2574
04:38:33,155 --> 04:38:35,782
I've heard the universe is expanding.

2575
04:38:37,659 --> 04:38:40,870
Heavenly bodies are hurtling away
from each other at a bewildering rate.

2576
04:38:42,039 --> 04:38:44,207
The universe is exploding,

2577
04:38:44,333 --> 04:38:47,251
and we find ourselves
at the very moment of explosion.

2578
04:38:49,630 --> 04:38:54,926
You once said
you were always changing masks...

2579
04:38:56,678 --> 04:38:58,971
until finally
you didn't know who you were.

2580
04:39:03,310 --> 04:39:06,020
I have only one mask.

2581
04:39:07,523 --> 04:39:10,274
But it's branded into my flesh.

2582
04:39:15,072 --> 04:39:17,156
If I tried to tear it off -

2583
04:39:27,543 --> 04:39:29,919
I always thought people liked me.

2584
04:39:33,131 --> 04:39:36,175
I saw myself as wise,
broad-minded and fair.

2585
04:39:38,387 --> 04:39:40,137
I had no idea...

2586
04:39:41,974 --> 04:39:44,725
that anyone could hate me.

2587
04:39:45,644 --> 04:39:47,311
I don't hate you.

2588
04:39:49,606 --> 04:39:52,191
No, but your son does.

2589
04:39:56,321 --> 04:39:57,822
I'm afraid of him.

2590
04:40:24,808 --> 04:40:26,517
Who's behind the door?

2591
04:40:27,686 --> 04:40:30,146
It is God behind the door.

2592
04:40:33,442 --> 04:40:38,195
- Can't you come out?
- No living being may see God's face.

2593
04:40:40,866 --> 04:40:44,869
- What do you want?
- To prove that I exist.

2594
04:40:49,458 --> 04:40:50,833
This is the end of me.

2595
04:40:50,959 --> 04:40:54,962
Shall I show myself?

2596
04:40:55,088 --> 04:40:56,714
Now you will see me.

2597
04:40:58,050 --> 04:41:00,843
Here I come, Alexander.

2598
04:41:27,329 --> 04:41:30,331
- Admit you were scared.
- I wasn't a damned bit scared.

2599
04:41:31,917 --> 04:41:33,751
"This is the end of me."

2600
04:41:37,839 --> 04:41:39,548
Ouch! That hurts.

2601
04:41:40,592 --> 04:41:42,093
Don't cry.

2602
04:41:43,095 --> 04:41:46,764
I didn't mean to scare you.
At least not that much.

2603
04:41:52,771 --> 04:41:55,189
I've been working all night
on this puppet.

2604
04:41:56,817 --> 04:42:00,861
A rich circus owner in England
is mad about our puppets.

2605
04:42:01,613 --> 04:42:03,823
I heard you tiptoeing around.

2606
04:42:06,451 --> 04:42:09,620
Hear that?
My brother Ismael is awake.

2607
04:42:10,580 --> 04:42:11,831
He's singing.

2608
04:42:19,506 --> 04:42:20,965
Poor Ismael.

2609
04:42:21,216 --> 04:42:23,384
Human beings are more
than he can bear.

2610
04:42:23,885 --> 04:42:26,303
Sometimes he gets furious.
Then he's dangerous.

2611
04:42:27,472 --> 04:42:30,641
Doctors say his intelligence
is light-years beyond normal.

2612
04:42:31,810 --> 04:42:33,394
He reads continuously.

2613
04:42:33,520 --> 04:42:36,313
He's incredibly learned
and knows everything by heart.

2614
04:42:36,565 --> 04:42:40,985
You said you'd been up all night,
but I saw you asleep.

2615
04:42:41,111 --> 04:42:43,696
There are many strange things
that can't be explained.

2616
04:42:44,489 --> 04:42:46,824
You realize that
when you dabble in magic.

2617
04:42:47,951 --> 04:42:50,661
Have you seen our mummy?
- No.

2618
04:42:52,039 --> 04:42:53,122
Come.

2619
04:43:38,835 --> 04:43:40,711
Look carefully, Alexander.

2620
04:43:41,880 --> 04:43:44,006
Can you see it breathing?

2621
04:43:44,883 --> 04:43:48,511
It's been dead 4,000 years,
but it breathes.

2622
04:43:50,222 --> 04:43:52,223
I'll make the room dark.

2623
04:43:58,647 --> 04:44:00,898
- What do you see?
- It's shining.

2624
04:44:01,566 --> 04:44:02,983
Exactly.

2625
04:44:04,027 --> 04:44:06,445
No one knows why it's luminous.

2626
04:44:07,739 --> 04:44:09,532
No one can explain why.

2627
04:44:11,910 --> 04:44:14,829
The unknown makes people angry.

2628
04:44:15,664 --> 04:44:19,083
It's better to blame it on mirrors,
machines and projections.

2629
04:44:19,543 --> 04:44:21,043
Then people laugh,

2630
04:44:21,419 --> 04:44:25,005
and that's healthier from all viewpoints,
especially financially.

2631
04:44:26,424 --> 04:44:27,967
Watch carefully now.

2632
04:44:56,830 --> 04:45:00,624
My father and mother ran
a magic theater in St. Petersburg.

2633
04:45:01,668 --> 04:45:04,461
One evening,
in the middle of a performance...

2634
04:45:05,672 --> 04:45:07,298
a real ghost appeared.

2635
04:45:09,009 --> 04:45:12,469
It was my father's aunt,
who had died two days earlier.

2636
04:45:13,680 --> 04:45:17,308
The ghost lost her way
among the machines and projectors.

2637
04:45:18,310 --> 04:45:21,729
It was a fiasco,
and Father had to refund the tickets.

2638
04:45:23,148 --> 04:45:25,816
- I know quite a bit about ghosts.
- Do you?

2639
04:45:27,485 --> 04:45:30,654
Uncle Isak says we're surrounded
by different realities,

2640
04:45:30,780 --> 04:45:32,406
one on top of the other.

2641
04:45:33,241 --> 04:45:35,993
There are swarms
of ghosts, spirits, phantoms,

2642
04:45:36,661 --> 04:45:39,496
souls, poltergeists,
angels and demons.

2643
04:45:41,499 --> 04:45:44,835
He says the smallest pebble
has a life of its own.

2644
04:45:45,545 --> 04:45:47,504
More coffee?
- Yes, please.

2645
04:45:49,257 --> 04:45:51,008
Everything is alive,

2646
04:45:51,676 --> 04:45:54,011
and everything
is God or God's thought.

2647
04:45:54,512 --> 04:45:57,056
Not only good things,
but the cruelest too.

2648
04:45:58,683 --> 04:46:00,309
What do you think?

2649
04:46:01,478 --> 04:46:02,937
If there is a God,

2650
04:46:03,146 --> 04:46:06,315
then he's a shit,
and I'd like to kick him in the butt.

2651
04:46:06,441 --> 04:46:08,817
Your theory is very interesting

2652
04:46:08,944 --> 04:46:11,737
and appears to be justified.

2653
04:46:13,073 --> 04:46:15,032
Shall we take Ismael his breakfast?

2654
04:46:19,120 --> 04:46:21,121
For my part, I'm an atheist.

2655
04:46:21,748 --> 04:46:25,668
If you've been raised as a magician
and learned all the tricks since childhood,

2656
04:46:25,794 --> 04:46:28,128
then you can do without
supernatural interference.

2657
04:46:28,672 --> 04:46:31,548
As a magician,
I create the believable.

2658
04:46:31,675 --> 04:46:34,468
The audience provides
the unbelievable.

2659
04:46:43,061 --> 04:46:46,897
You're definitely no idiot, Alexander,
especially considering you're only nine.

2660
04:46:47,315 --> 04:46:49,275
- I'll be eleven in November.
- Here.

2661
04:46:58,243 --> 04:47:00,077
I've brought your breakfast.

2662
04:47:16,219 --> 04:47:19,930
Your sister gave me sleeping pills
for my insomnia.

2663
04:47:20,932 --> 04:47:23,100
I had put three in the broth.

2664
04:47:23,268 --> 04:47:26,103
I didn't mean for you to drink it.

2665
04:47:26,855 --> 04:47:31,275
When you went to see Elsa,
I put in three more.

2666
04:47:35,071 --> 04:47:37,031
You will sleep soundly.

2667
04:47:39,868 --> 04:47:41,910
When you wake up, I will be gone.

2668
04:47:43,621 --> 04:47:45,664
I'm going back to my children...

2669
04:47:47,208 --> 04:47:48,625
to my home...

2670
04:47:50,795 --> 04:47:52,421
and my family.

2671
04:48:15,153 --> 04:48:17,988
I'll change and you'll come back.

2672
04:48:18,490 --> 04:48:20,699
I'll never come back!

2673
04:48:20,825 --> 04:48:22,826
I'll poison your life!

2674
04:48:22,952 --> 04:48:24,620
I'll follow you from town to town!

2675
04:48:24,746 --> 04:48:26,747
I'll ruin your children's future!

2676
04:48:26,873 --> 04:48:29,833
Poor Edvard, you don't know
what you're saying!

2677
04:48:30,001 --> 04:48:31,502
I am awake!

2678
04:48:32,420 --> 04:48:34,463
I'm horribly awake.

2679
04:48:39,344 --> 04:48:42,012
Help me into bed at least.

2680
04:48:43,848 --> 04:48:46,058
I can't see anymore...

2681
04:48:47,185 --> 04:48:48,769
and I feel dizzy.

2682
04:48:53,024 --> 04:48:57,194
Are you there? I can't see.

2683
04:49:05,620 --> 04:49:08,080
Ismael, I've brought your breakfast.

2684
04:49:25,265 --> 04:49:26,890
Good morning, Ismael.

2685
04:49:29,853 --> 04:49:32,855
This is Alexander Ekdahl, a friend.

2686
04:49:34,190 --> 04:49:35,816
Leave us alone, Aron.

2687
04:49:37,610 --> 04:49:40,070
Don't worry. I won't eat him...

2688
04:49:41,239 --> 04:49:43,407
even if he does look appetizing.

2689
04:49:46,411 --> 04:49:48,328
You can come back in half an hour.

2690
04:49:49,539 --> 04:49:51,582
Go now, Aron.
- Uncle Isak -

2691
04:49:51,749 --> 04:49:54,960
Uncle Isak is an old goat
and needn't know of Alexander's visit.

2692
04:49:56,379 --> 04:49:57,671
Go now.

2693
04:50:18,276 --> 04:50:19,610
No, thank you.

2694
04:50:21,446 --> 04:50:23,947
My name is Ismael,
but you already know that.

2695
04:50:27,202 --> 04:50:29,620
"And he will be a wild man.

2696
04:50:30,580 --> 04:50:33,957
His hand will be against every man,

2697
04:50:34,626 --> 04:50:37,252
and every man's hand against him."

2698
04:50:40,256 --> 04:50:43,675
I'm considered dangerous.
That's why I'm locked up.

2699
04:50:43,801 --> 04:50:45,344
Dangerous in what way?

2700
04:50:47,972 --> 04:50:49,598
Write your name here.

2701
04:50:51,476 --> 04:50:54,645
The pencil's pretty dull,
but it should still serve.

2702
04:50:57,649 --> 04:51:00,984
There, Alexander Ekdahl.

2703
04:51:01,611 --> 04:51:03,237
Now read what you've written.

2704
04:51:05,573 --> 04:51:09,034
It says "Ismael Retzinsky."

2705
04:51:15,667 --> 04:51:19,461
Perhaps we're the same person,
with no boundaries.

2706
04:51:20,672 --> 04:51:22,589
Perhaps we flow through each other,

2707
04:51:22,924 --> 04:51:26,426
stream through each other
boundlessly and magnificently.

2708
04:51:30,682 --> 04:51:33,016
You bear such terrible thoughts...

2709
04:51:34,727 --> 04:51:37,396
it's almost painful to be near you.

2710
04:51:40,024 --> 04:51:41,525
Yet it's also enticing.

2711
04:51:43,027 --> 04:51:46,321
Do you know why?
- I don't think I want to know.

2712
04:51:51,619 --> 04:51:55,122
You've heard of making an image
of someone you dislike

2713
04:51:55,248 --> 04:51:57,249
and sticking pins in it?

2714
04:51:59,335 --> 04:52:00,877
It's a rather clumsy method

2715
04:52:01,004 --> 04:52:04,590
when you think of the swift paths
an evil thought can travel.

2716
04:52:10,096 --> 04:52:12,556
You're a strange little person.

2717
04:52:14,559 --> 04:52:18,645
You won't speak of that
which is constantly in your thoughts.

2718
04:52:26,988 --> 04:52:29,197
You're thinking of a man's death.

2719
04:52:30,116 --> 04:52:31,408
Wait a moment.

2720
04:52:32,076 --> 04:52:34,036
I know who you're thinking of:

2721
04:52:39,459 --> 04:52:42,252
A tall man with fair, graying hair.

2722
04:52:42,420 --> 04:52:43,962
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2723
04:52:44,172 --> 04:52:48,175
He has clear blue eyes
and a boyish face.

2724
04:52:48,301 --> 04:52:49,926
Correct me if I'm wrong.

2725
04:52:50,928 --> 04:52:55,057
He's asleep and dreams
he's kneeling at the altar.

2726
04:52:55,850 --> 04:52:58,602
Above the altar
hangs the crucified prophet.

2727
04:52:59,854 --> 04:53:02,022
In his dream he gets up
and cries out,

2728
04:53:03,191 --> 04:53:07,611
"My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me?"

2729
04:53:09,656 --> 04:53:11,490
There is no answer,

2730
04:53:11,908 --> 04:53:13,492
not even a laugh.

2731
04:53:13,993 --> 04:53:15,952
Don't talk like that.

2732
04:53:16,913 --> 04:53:18,455
It is not I talking.

2733
04:53:20,500 --> 04:53:22,000
It is yourself.

2734
04:53:26,422 --> 04:53:28,131
You are not to hesitate.

2735
04:53:31,135 --> 04:53:35,722
He's sound asleep,
plagued by nightmares.

2736
04:53:38,518 --> 04:53:40,394
Give me your hands.

2737
04:53:41,396 --> 04:53:45,023
It isn't really necessary,
but it's safer.

2738
04:53:48,820 --> 04:53:50,779
The doors will be thrown open.

2739
04:53:51,072 --> 04:53:53,407
A scream will echo through the house.

2740
04:53:54,325 --> 04:53:56,451
- I don't want to.
- It's too late.

2741
04:53:57,578 --> 04:54:00,497
You have only one way to go,
and I am with you.

2742
04:54:01,040 --> 04:54:02,958
I obliterate myself.

2743
04:54:03,209 --> 04:54:05,168
I merge into you, my child.

2744
04:54:05,503 --> 04:54:07,754
Don't be afraid.
I am with you.

2745
04:54:07,964 --> 04:54:10,048
I'm your guardian angel.

2746
04:54:14,178 --> 04:54:17,723
It is 5:00 in the morning,
and the sun has just risen.

2747
04:54:18,558 --> 04:54:20,350
The doors are thrown open.

2748
04:54:20,893 --> 04:54:22,436
No, wait.

2749
04:54:22,812 --> 04:54:27,607
First a horrible scream
echoes through the house.

2750
04:54:29,026 --> 04:54:33,530
A shapeless burning figure
moves across the floor,

2751
04:54:34,115 --> 04:54:35,198
screaming.

2752
04:54:35,324 --> 04:54:36,575
I don't want to.

2753
04:54:36,701 --> 04:54:38,702
Let me go! Let me go!

2754
04:55:17,533 --> 04:55:20,827
The police are here
and insist on speaking to you.

2755
04:55:36,093 --> 04:55:38,094
Honored, Mrs. Vergérus.

2756
04:55:38,221 --> 04:55:40,764
It is my painful duty,

2757
04:55:40,932 --> 04:55:44,726
as the town's ranking
administrator of justice,

2758
04:55:45,019 --> 04:55:48,855
to have to inform you
of the terrible circumstances

2759
04:55:48,981 --> 04:55:51,483
surrounding your husband's
horrible death.

2760
04:55:51,984 --> 04:55:55,070
Furthermore,
according to the law of the land,

2761
04:55:55,196 --> 04:55:59,115
and in the presence of this witness,
Chief Inspector Jespersson,

2762
04:55:59,367 --> 04:56:03,954
I must conduct a short and, I assure you,
in all respects formal interrogation,

2763
04:56:04,163 --> 04:56:07,165
for which I beg your forgiveness.

2764
04:56:09,335 --> 04:56:10,627
Your husband,

2765
04:56:11,087 --> 04:56:12,671
His Grace the bishop,

2766
04:56:13,464 --> 04:56:18,093
lost his life this morning
under terrible circumstances.

2767
04:56:20,555 --> 04:56:21,972
May I, madam?

2768
04:56:25,268 --> 04:56:28,812
We think we've been able to determine
the course of events.

2769
04:56:30,398 --> 04:56:34,150
Miss Elsa Bergius,
who was gravely ill, lay in bed.

2770
04:56:34,485 --> 04:56:36,820
On her bedside table stood a lamp.

2771
04:56:37,321 --> 04:56:39,823
By some unfortunate accident,
the lamp fell on the bed

2772
04:56:39,991 --> 04:56:44,578
igniting her nightgown,
hair and bed linens.

2773
04:56:44,704 --> 04:56:48,832
Blazing like a torch,
she ran through the house

2774
04:56:49,083 --> 04:56:53,837
and by chance made it
into the bishop's bedchamber.

2775
04:56:56,048 --> 04:57:01,344
According to His Grace's sister,
Miss Henrietta Vergérus,

2776
04:57:01,929 --> 04:57:05,432
he was in a heavy sleep

2777
04:57:05,558 --> 04:57:07,142
from a soporific

2778
04:57:07,518 --> 04:57:11,605
you had given him earlier that night.

2779
04:57:12,481 --> 04:57:15,358
After a heated quarrel
with your husband,

2780
04:57:15,484 --> 04:57:18,278
you left the house

2781
04:57:18,404 --> 04:57:20,030
at 4:20 a.m.

2782
04:57:21,908 --> 04:57:24,618
Miss Bergius flung herself on him,

2783
04:57:24,744 --> 04:57:27,746
igniting his bedclothes
and nightshirt.

2784
04:57:28,205 --> 04:57:30,415
His Grace woke up
and succeeded in freeing himself

2785
04:57:30,541 --> 04:57:33,043
from the dying woman
who was still ablaze.

2786
04:57:34,712 --> 04:57:38,131
But he could not
extinguish the flames

2787
04:57:38,799 --> 04:57:40,425
that were now engulfing him.

2788
04:57:42,053 --> 04:57:45,680
Old Mrs. Vergérus found her son

2789
04:57:46,390 --> 04:57:50,143
with his body burnt
and face charred.

2790
04:57:51,771 --> 04:57:56,608
He showed faint signs of life
and said he was in unbearable agony.

2791
04:57:57,860 --> 04:58:00,612
Ten minutes later, the doctor
and ambulance arrived on the scene,

2792
04:58:01,280 --> 04:58:05,241
but by then His Grace had already
been released from his suffering

2793
04:58:06,160 --> 04:58:08,495
and had taken his last breath.

2794
04:58:12,667 --> 04:58:16,086
Although I can't overlook the fact

2795
04:58:16,212 --> 04:58:21,424
that the sleeping aid you gave him
possibly made the disaster worse,

2796
04:58:21,550 --> 04:58:24,886
I also cannot attach
any serious importance to it.

2797
04:58:25,221 --> 04:58:28,932
Therefore, I must characterize the event
as an ill-fated coincidence

2798
04:58:29,100 --> 04:58:32,185
of extremely unfortunate
circumstances.

2799
04:58:33,896 --> 04:58:36,982
Therefore I beg

2800
04:58:37,817 --> 04:58:39,234
to extend to you

2801
04:58:39,986 --> 04:58:43,279
my deepest, most sincere condolences.

2802
04:58:46,200 --> 04:58:47,659
Come, Jespersson.

2803
04:59:03,467 --> 04:59:06,302
Madame, I had the honor
to wait upon you yesterday,

2804
04:59:06,470 --> 04:59:10,140
but your maid showed me the door
with an offensive message.

2805
04:59:11,642 --> 04:59:15,145
Monsieur le marquis,
I blush at your presumption

2806
04:59:15,229 --> 04:59:18,815
and can only deplore the fact
that my servants this morning

2807
04:59:19,108 --> 04:59:21,651
were unable to show you
the door once again.

2808
04:59:23,154 --> 04:59:25,321
You say that you love me, sir.

2809
04:59:25,823 --> 04:59:29,200
In that case, be so kind
as to spare me your presence,

2810
04:59:29,285 --> 04:59:32,954
because, frankly,
it does me only harm,

2811
04:59:33,039 --> 04:59:37,000
not to mention the anger
over the embarrassment you caused me

2812
04:59:37,376 --> 04:59:39,377
in the presence
of her Majesty the Queen.

2813
04:59:41,839 --> 04:59:45,300
Marquis, to what do we owe
the honor of such an early visit?

2814
04:59:45,384 --> 04:59:47,469
- Count!
- Marquis!

2815
04:59:47,595 --> 04:59:52,348
Only the thought of the blood
you have shed for your king, sir,

2816
04:59:52,683 --> 04:59:57,187
prevents me from instantly
and with all my power

2817
04:59:57,605 --> 05:00:00,648
throwing back in your face...

2818
05:00:01,192 --> 05:00:03,902
The infamy you have committed
against the marquise -

2819
05:00:04,028 --> 05:00:08,823
The infamy you have committed
against the marquise.

2820
05:00:10,201 --> 05:00:13,953
It's not enough this is the worst rubbish
ever written in the French language.

2821
05:00:14,080 --> 05:00:18,249
In addition, the translation
is terrible, Mr. Landahl.

2822
05:00:18,751 --> 05:00:22,170
I'm telling you honestly, even though
I know you've gone to great trouble.

2823
05:00:22,296 --> 05:00:24,714
I know it was done in haste,
Mr. Morsing,

2824
05:00:25,549 --> 05:00:27,467
but we find ourselves in a crisis.

2825
05:00:27,593 --> 05:00:31,888
In the past we performed Shakespeare
and the great Molière.

2826
05:00:32,473 --> 05:00:36,684
We were even so bold as to let
Henrik Ibsen's voice be heard.

2827
05:00:36,977 --> 05:00:39,062
Public taste, Mr. Morsing.

2828
05:00:40,147 --> 05:00:42,774
They no longer wish to hear
the songs of giants.

2829
05:00:42,900 --> 05:00:45,068
They're content
with the tunes of dwarfs.

2830
05:00:45,736 --> 05:00:50,240
No one cares about our theater,
neither the public nor the Ekdahl family.

2831
05:00:50,574 --> 05:00:52,242
Funds are running dry.

2832
05:00:53,410 --> 05:00:55,370
Our actors fare badly.

2833
05:00:56,205 --> 05:00:57,163
Hanna.

2834
05:00:59,208 --> 05:01:00,875
Emilie dear.

2835
05:01:16,600 --> 05:01:18,601
Now you'll stay with us, won't you?

2836
05:01:20,062 --> 05:01:22,313
I don't know
why I'm so damned moved.

2837
05:01:24,483 --> 05:01:26,109
Dear Mrs. Ekdahl.

2838
05:01:34,660 --> 05:01:36,911
I'm at a loss for words.

2839
05:01:44,086 --> 05:01:45,920
Now everything will be right again.

2840
05:01:50,885 --> 05:01:52,302
Dearest Emilie.

2841
05:01:56,932 --> 05:01:58,266
Welcome back.

2842
05:01:59,768 --> 05:02:01,102
Thank you.

2843
05:02:43,938 --> 05:02:49,108
My dear, dear friends.

2844
05:02:51,195 --> 05:02:53,655
I am more moved than I can say.

2845
05:02:56,533 --> 05:02:58,159
Dear friends...

2846
05:02:59,954 --> 05:03:01,204
dearest Mama...

2847
05:03:01,914 --> 05:03:04,332
my most beloved wife, Alma...

2848
05:03:05,709 --> 05:03:10,838
my darling Emilie,
more beautiful than ever.

2849
05:03:11,632 --> 05:03:14,092
My wonderful children, Petra,

2850
05:03:14,218 --> 05:03:16,052
Jenny and Putte,

2851
05:03:16,220 --> 05:03:20,598
and little Miss Helena Viktoria,

2852
05:03:20,724 --> 05:03:23,851
lying so peacefully in her bed.

2853
05:03:26,313 --> 05:03:28,064
And dear Maj...

2854
05:03:29,984 --> 05:03:31,985
of whom I'm very fond.

2855
05:03:35,406 --> 05:03:39,325
And not forgetting
my incomparable brother Carl,

2856
05:03:40,202 --> 05:03:42,245
and his sweet wife.

2857
05:03:42,413 --> 05:03:45,832
My most honored friend,

2858
05:03:45,958 --> 05:03:47,292
Isak Jacobi,

2859
05:03:48,002 --> 05:03:52,839
who has rendered immeasurable
service to this family.

2860
05:03:52,923 --> 05:03:54,507
Dear Vega and Ester,

2861
05:03:54,633 --> 05:03:59,846
and you good friends who faithfully
help us up the hill of life.

2862
05:04:01,682 --> 05:04:03,599
Last, but not least

2863
05:04:03,726 --> 05:04:05,935
dear and admired,

2864
05:04:06,645 --> 05:04:10,273
greatly talented and brilliant artists,

2865
05:04:10,441 --> 05:04:15,111
if I could I would encompass
you all in one big embrace

2866
05:04:15,195 --> 05:04:18,323
and plant a kiss on your brows.

2867
05:04:18,449 --> 05:04:21,617
A kiss which, more than words,

2868
05:04:21,744 --> 05:04:25,038
would tell you
of my happiness and love.

2869
05:04:25,873 --> 05:04:27,248
Cheers, everyone!

2870
05:04:34,381 --> 05:04:37,383
Just imagine:
We're all together again!

2871
05:04:38,135 --> 05:04:42,138
Our little world
has closed around us in safety,

2872
05:04:42,264 --> 05:04:44,807
wisdom and order.

2873
05:04:45,684 --> 05:04:48,061
After a period of fear and confusion...

2874
05:04:49,480 --> 05:04:53,232
death's shadows have been routed,

2875
05:04:54,318 --> 05:04:59,989
winter has been put to flight,
and joy has returned to our hearts.

2876
05:05:01,033 --> 05:05:03,701
Now I must have a look
at little Helena Viktoria.

2877
05:05:08,832 --> 05:05:12,710
She's laughing at me,
my daughter Helena Viktoria.

2878
05:05:13,379 --> 05:05:14,670
Now for a speech.

2879
05:05:17,216 --> 05:05:19,300
Go on, laugh at your old father.

2880
05:05:19,426 --> 05:05:22,178
Never mind what he says.
It's only nonsense.

2881
05:05:28,519 --> 05:05:31,521
My wisdom is simple.

2882
05:05:32,439 --> 05:05:36,651
There are those who despise it,
but I don't give a damn -

2883
05:05:37,194 --> 05:05:39,862
Forgive me, Mama.
I noticed you raised your right eyebrow.

2884
05:05:40,030 --> 05:05:43,199
You think your son is talking too much.
Don't worry. I will be brief.

2885
05:05:43,575 --> 05:05:46,744
Therefore... and consequently...

2886
05:05:49,206 --> 05:05:53,376
we Ekdahls have not come
into the world to see through it.

2887
05:05:53,544 --> 05:05:54,627
Never think that.

2888
05:05:55,462 --> 05:06:00,550
We are not equipped
for such excursions.

2889
05:06:01,385 --> 05:06:05,221
We might just as well ignore
the big things.

2890
05:06:06,682 --> 05:06:12,228
We must live in the little world.

2891
05:06:14,314 --> 05:06:16,357
We will be content with that

2892
05:06:17,276 --> 05:06:21,362
and cultivate it
and make the best of it.

2893
05:06:25,492 --> 05:06:27,118
Suddenly death strikes.

2894
05:06:28,912 --> 05:06:32,665
Suddenly the abyss opens.

2895
05:06:34,293 --> 05:06:37,587
Suddenly the storm howls,
and disaster is upon us.

2896
05:06:38,213 --> 05:06:40,047
All that we know.

2897
05:06:40,716 --> 05:06:44,343
But let us not think
of all that unpleasantness.

2898
05:06:44,803 --> 05:06:47,763
We Ekdahls love our subterfuges.

2899
05:06:48,432 --> 05:06:54,103
Rob a man of his subterfuges
and he goes mad and begins lashing out.

2900
05:06:54,229 --> 05:06:58,399
Damn it all,
people must be intelligible!

2901
05:07:00,110 --> 05:07:03,279
Otherwise we don't dare to love them
or speak ill of them.

2902
05:07:04,448 --> 05:07:08,701
We must be able to grasp
the world and reality

2903
05:07:09,453 --> 05:07:14,123
so we can complain of their monotony
with a clear conscience.

2904
05:07:15,876 --> 05:07:20,796
Don't be sad, dear splendid artists.

2905
05:07:22,716 --> 05:07:27,637
Actors and actresses,
we need you all the same.

2906
05:07:28,639 --> 05:07:33,809
It is you who must give us
our supernatural shivers,

2907
05:07:34,645 --> 05:07:37,980
or better yet,
our innermost diversions.

2908
05:07:42,069 --> 05:07:46,239
The world is a den of thieves
and night is falling.

2909
05:07:48,408 --> 05:07:52,078
Evil breaks its chains
and runs through the world like a mad dog.

2910
05:07:54,331 --> 05:07:56,249
The poison affects us all,

2911
05:07:56,959 --> 05:07:59,669
us Ekdahls and everyone else.

2912
05:07:59,836 --> 05:08:01,504
No one escapes,

2913
05:08:02,714 --> 05:08:08,386
not even Helena Viktoria
or little Aurora.

2914
05:08:11,640 --> 05:08:13,182
So it shall be.

2915
05:08:15,435 --> 05:08:20,856
Therefore let us be happy
while we are happy.

2916
05:08:22,109 --> 05:08:26,487
Let us be kind, generous,
affectionate and good.

2917
05:08:27,781 --> 05:08:31,701
It is necessary,
and not at all shameful...

2918
05:08:33,161 --> 05:08:36,872
to take pleasure in the little world.

2919
05:08:38,959 --> 05:08:40,585
Good food...

2920
05:08:41,628 --> 05:08:43,629
gentle smiles...

2921
05:08:45,299 --> 05:08:49,552
fruit trees in bloom, waltzes.

2922
05:08:50,596 --> 05:08:55,766
My dearest friends,
I'm done talking,

2923
05:08:55,892 --> 05:08:57,893
and you can take it as you like:

2924
05:08:58,061 --> 05:09:02,607
The sentimental ramblings
of an uneducated restaurateur

2925
05:09:02,733 --> 05:09:05,109
or the pitiful babbling of an old man.

2926
05:09:05,235 --> 05:09:07,236
I don't care.

2927
05:09:21,960 --> 05:09:25,087
I hold a little empress in my arms.

2928
05:09:28,258 --> 05:09:32,637
It's tangible yet immeasurable.

2929
05:09:35,265 --> 05:09:38,976
One day she will prove
everything I just said wrong.

2930
05:09:40,437 --> 05:09:43,814
One day she will not only rule
the little world,

2931
05:09:44,816 --> 05:09:46,776
but everything.

2932
05:09:48,362 --> 05:09:49,904
Everything.

2933
05:10:11,635 --> 05:10:13,552
You still sitting there?

2934
05:10:15,263 --> 05:10:17,139
Aren't you going to bed?

2935
05:10:17,307 --> 05:10:19,308
Now we'II have champagne.

2936
05:10:19,810 --> 05:10:23,062
We will, will we?

2937
05:10:25,440 --> 05:10:27,525
Well, I'm going to bed.

2938
05:10:28,151 --> 05:10:31,529
- We're supposed to have champagne.
- Don't forget your jacket.

2939
05:10:31,822 --> 05:10:33,989
Yes, Colonel!

2940
05:10:34,157 --> 05:10:35,950
There, there, my child.

2941
05:10:36,076 --> 05:10:39,203
Be a good girl now,
so that Mama can go to bed.

2942
05:10:40,330 --> 05:10:42,832
I think you've finished eating,
in any case.

2943
05:10:43,166 --> 05:10:45,960
- I'll take her.
- Thank you, Rosa.

2944
05:10:49,172 --> 05:10:51,674
- How do you like it here?
- Everyone's so kind.

2945
05:10:52,259 --> 05:10:54,176
Especially Mr. Ekdahl.

2946
05:10:54,511 --> 05:10:56,429
He must be a real friend of humanity.

2947
05:10:56,680 --> 05:10:58,556
That he certainly is.

2948
05:10:58,849 --> 05:11:02,935
He's particularly kind to young girls,
so you watch out, Rosa.

2949
05:11:03,061 --> 05:11:04,603
Oh, my!

2950
05:11:09,985 --> 05:11:11,861
- Good night, madam.
- Good night, Rosa.

2951
05:11:34,384 --> 05:11:36,135
We're going to have champagne.

2952
05:11:36,261 --> 05:11:40,181
If you're a good boy, I'II bring you
a beer and sandwich in bed.

2953
05:11:44,936 --> 05:11:48,189
I'm sure Emilie will want
a glass of champagne.

2954
05:11:48,315 --> 05:11:51,567
We'II raise a toast to our daughters.

2955
05:11:52,027 --> 05:11:53,903
Go to bed now, Gusten.

2956
05:11:54,029 --> 05:11:57,448
I'm so damned happy!

2957
05:11:59,284 --> 05:12:02,870
That's nice, Gusten,
but you'll have a headache tomorrow.

2958
05:12:03,246 --> 05:12:06,081
Imagine: We're together again.

2959
05:12:12,506 --> 05:12:15,883
I'm going to the country tomorrow
to speak with the workmen.

2960
05:12:16,259 --> 05:12:17,927
Do you need anything taken care of?

2961
05:12:18,094 --> 05:12:21,055
I'll be there until Thursday.
- I'II come on Tuesday.

2962
05:12:21,181 --> 05:12:24,975
Don't you think I have
the best wife in the world?

2963
05:12:25,101 --> 05:12:27,102
Much better than you deserve.

2964
05:12:28,647 --> 05:12:31,774
And the world's
prettiest little mistress.

2965
05:12:32,067 --> 05:12:34,443
A real darling.

2966
05:12:35,153 --> 05:12:37,363
- Are you going in the morning?
- Not until 2:00.

2967
05:12:39,950 --> 05:12:44,829
When I see you,
I want to weep with joy.

2968
05:12:44,955 --> 05:12:48,624
To think you're back with us again!

2969
05:12:51,711 --> 05:12:54,129
- Good night, Gusten.
- Good night.

2970
05:12:55,215 --> 05:12:57,967
Be a good boy now, and remember
that Alma needs her sleep.

2971
05:13:00,804 --> 05:13:03,597
I know what Alma needs.

2972
05:13:31,376 --> 05:13:32,543
Aunt Emilie.

2973
05:13:33,086 --> 05:13:37,089
- What do you two want at this hour?
- We want to move to Stockholm.

2974
05:13:37,215 --> 05:13:40,801
Marianne Egerman is opening
a boutique and wants us to help.

2975
05:13:41,177 --> 05:13:43,929
- And we'd like to.
- We'd very much like to.

2976
05:13:45,432 --> 05:13:47,266
But we have a big problem.

2977
05:13:47,392 --> 05:13:49,935
Papa insists on that café for Maj.

2978
05:13:50,061 --> 05:13:51,645
He's so kind.

2979
05:13:53,690 --> 05:13:57,443
- Maj's had enough of his tutelage.
- He's so kind.

2980
05:13:57,569 --> 05:14:01,280
She wants to live her own life
and decide for herself and her baby.

2981
05:14:01,656 --> 05:14:03,490
I don't know what to do.

2982
05:14:03,617 --> 05:14:05,117
We've spoken to Mama.

2983
05:14:05,368 --> 05:14:08,954
She was awfully upset at first
and said we couldn't do that to Papa.

2984
05:14:09,539 --> 05:14:13,751
Then she calmed down and said
that life must take its course...

2985
05:14:14,878 --> 05:14:17,212
and that one shouldn't force
one's children.

2986
05:14:17,881 --> 05:14:20,090
Though she felt sorry
for Papa's sake.

2987
05:14:21,343 --> 05:14:23,093
It's awful.

2988
05:14:23,219 --> 05:14:25,346
You must think of yourself.

2989
05:14:25,889 --> 05:14:29,475
After all, Papa's an old man.
Isn't that true, Aunt Emilie?

2990
05:14:29,935 --> 05:14:32,394
Go to bed now.
I'll have a word with Grandmama.

2991
05:15:40,672 --> 05:15:43,465
Emilie, how nice to see you!
Welcome!

2992
05:15:43,800 --> 05:15:45,467
I need to speak with you.

2993
05:15:45,635 --> 05:15:47,553
- Would you like a cognac?
- No, thank you.

2994
05:15:47,679 --> 05:15:49,304
Is it anything serious?

2995
05:15:49,806 --> 05:15:53,017
Oh, yes. Maj and Petra
want to move to Stockholm.

2996
05:15:53,727 --> 05:15:54,977
What do you think?

2997
05:16:21,004 --> 05:16:22,838
You can't escape me.

2998
05:16:28,845 --> 05:16:30,345
One other thing.

2999
05:16:30,513 --> 05:16:32,473
You're right.

3000
05:16:32,974 --> 05:16:36,560
On his deathbed, Oscar asked you
to take charge of the theater.

3001
05:16:37,395 --> 05:16:39,521
I was there.
I remember it well.

3002
05:16:39,939 --> 05:16:41,774
Gustav Adolf will be awfully hurt.

3003
05:16:42,025 --> 05:16:44,943
Why all this concern
for Gustav Adolf?

3004
05:16:45,862 --> 05:16:47,821
He has a good head for business,

3005
05:16:48,031 --> 05:16:50,866
but he doesn't know
a thing about theater.

3006
05:16:51,367 --> 05:16:53,577
It's your theater, my dear Emilie.

3007
05:16:55,246 --> 05:16:57,748
It's about time we explain
to our backwoods Napoleon

3008
05:16:57,957 --> 05:16:59,708
that he's facing his Waterloo.

3009
05:17:00,877 --> 05:17:04,254
I'd like you to read a new play
by August Strindberg.

3010
05:17:05,173 --> 05:17:07,466
That nasty misogynist!

3011
05:17:07,717 --> 05:17:08,717
No, thank you.

3012
05:17:08,885 --> 05:17:10,803
It's called A Dream Play.

3013
05:17:12,889 --> 05:17:14,890
I thought we'd both perform in it.

3014
05:17:15,767 --> 05:17:18,560
Not on your life.
I haven't appeared on stage in -

3015
05:17:18,686 --> 05:17:22,523
All the more reason.
I won't disturb you any longer.

3016
05:17:23,608 --> 05:17:26,401
You never disturb me.

3017
05:17:32,492 --> 05:17:34,409
What are you laughing at?

3018
05:17:34,661 --> 05:17:37,287
Now we're the ones in charge,
aren't we?

3019
05:17:37,747 --> 05:17:38,914
Do you think so?

3020
05:17:41,042 --> 05:17:44,086
- Good night, dearest.
- Good night, my dear.

3021
05:18:26,129 --> 05:18:31,758
"Everything can happen.
Everything is possible and probable.

3022
05:18:32,594 --> 05:18:35,345
Time and space do not exist.

3023
05:18:36,014 --> 05:18:39,308
On a flimsy framework of reality,

3024
05:18:39,809 --> 05:18:45,147
the imagination spins,
weaving new patterns."
