1
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,447
Come on.

2
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:47,749
- Ta-ta.
- Ta-ta.

3
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,340
Don't forget the checkie.
Can't produce plays without checkies.

4
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:56,554
You can count on me,
you dirty young man.

5
00:00:57,808 --> 00:00:59,800
Oh...! Oh!

6
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:01,801
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

7
00:01:01,937 --> 00:01:03,678
Goodbye. Bye.

8
00:01:03,814 --> 00:01:06,431
Bye... bye. Bye-bye.

9
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,274
Old buzzard.

10
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:22,238
Hold me, touch me.

11
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,458
Hold me, touch me.
Hold me, touch me.

12
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,919
Hold me, touch me. Ah!

13
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,038
Hold me, touch me!

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,461
Uh!

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,807
Darling.

16
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,018
Hold me. Touch me.

17
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:45,227
Not in the hall.

18
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,438
Ooh!

19
00:01:57,826 --> 00:02:01,319
I know she's in here.
I wonder where she's hiding.

20
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:03,117
Where are you?

21
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:05,581
Where are you, devil woman?

22
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:13,832
Finders keepers...

23
00:02:16,595 --> 00:02:19,303
Here I come, ready or not.

24
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,144
There you are, you little flirt.

25
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,517
Argh!

26
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:00,670
What's the matter?

27
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,765
Papa no want to play with baby?

28
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,009
I think Papa's neck is broken.

29
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,932
What a sissy!

30
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,312
Miaow!

31
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,523
Miaow!

32
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:21,024
I wonder where old Tom is tonight?

33
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,777
I...

34
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,912
Oh... oh!

35
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:16,871
Oh, Bialy, Bialy, darling.
Did I hurt you?

36
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:20,466
- It's only a flesh wound, lamb chop.
- Oh, don't...

37
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,551
Don't worry, darling.

38
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,685
I'll kiss it and make it well.

39
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,554
Mmh...

40
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,852
Mr Bialystock. Mr Bialystock?

41
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,022
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, my God.

42
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,486
I mean...

43
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,197
I mean, excuse me.

44
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,163
You mean "oops", don't you?
Just say "oops" and get out!

45
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,953
Ah-ah-ah-ah...

46
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:55,371
Not "ah-ah-ah-ah".
"Oops!"

47
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,040
Oops!

48
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,542
I can't abide a peeping Tom.

49
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:08,218
There's one in the apartment
just opposite my bedroom window.

50
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,391
I swear, that man never takes
his field glasses off me,

51
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,263
not for a minute.

52
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,357
- Feeling better?
- Yes.

53
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,692
Good.

54
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,948
Let's fool around.

55
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,259
Now...

56
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,505
I'll be the innocent little milkmaid,

57
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,223
and you be the naughty stable boy.

58
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,764
Ooh!

59
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,058
This milk is so heavy.

60
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,557
I'll never reach the house.

61
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:03,277
Help... Help me.
Will someone help me?

62
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,863
- Help me!
- Wait! Wait! We can't play today.

63
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:08,608
- I have too many appointments.
- We can't play today?

64
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,201
Thursday! Thursday!
We'll play on Thursday.

65
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,288
We'll play "The Contessa
and the Chauffeur".

66
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:59,459
- Oh, the best one!
- Until Thursday then, <i>Contessa mia.</i>

67
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,452
<i>Contessa mia.</i>

68
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:04,789
Oh, no, Bialy, Bialy,
please, just a little.

69
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,336
Just a little.

70
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,836
Money. I need money.

71
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,555
All right. All right. All right.

72
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,970
The Contessa and the Chauffeur.

73
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,269
So the Count hired you this morning,
Rudolfo?

74
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,517
Watch the road. Watch the road.

75
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:26,360
I can't take my eyes off you.

76
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,481
How can I drive
when you drive me mad? Mad!

77
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,949
Rudolfo, you dirty pig.

78
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:34,244
Pull over.

79
00:07:59,646 --> 00:08:01,683
That's enough. Good. Good.

80
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:05,058
We'll do the rest on Thursday.
Now, that's a good girl. That's a good...

81
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:08,186
I'll get you your purse
and your gloves. Till Thursday...

82
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,031
Thursday.

83
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,616
Until Thursday, then,
you bawdy wench.

84
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:18,579
- Oh, hold me. Touch me.
- Thursday. Thursday.

85
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,075
And then we'll finish playing
the Contessa and Rudolfo?

86
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,167
First thing on Thursday.

87
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,332
Oh! And after that,

88
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,878
we'll play "The Abduction
and the Cruel Rape of Lucretia",

89
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,797
and I'll be Lucretia.

90
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,841
And I'll be Rape.
On Thursday. That's wonderful.

91
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:40,514
Lucretia, you forgot the checkie.
Can't produce plays without checkies.

92
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,392
Of course.
Well, I had it with me all the time.

93
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:50,027
Is it all right? I made it out to "cash",
you didn't tell me the name of the play.

94
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,397
Fine. Fine. Good. Good.

95
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,818
Thursday. Thursday.

96
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,987
Goodbye, my powder pigeon.

97
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,031
- Goodbye,
- Bye-bye.

98
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,780
- Ta-ta.
- Ta-ta.

99
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,031
Goodbye.

100
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,085
He who signs the lease,
must pay rent.

101
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,044
That's the law.

102
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,757
Why, you're a thief! How can you take
the last penny out of a poor man's pocket?

103
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,547
I have to.

104
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,340
I'm a landlord.

105
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,088
O Lord, hear my plea.

106
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,466
Destroy him.
He maketh a blight on the land.

107
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,218
Don't listen to him.
He's crazy.

108
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,642
That hurt.
I must make another call.

109
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,414
Oops?

110
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,333
Who are you?
What do you want?

111
00:09:50,465 --> 00:09:52,548
Why are you loitering in my hallway?

112
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,507
Speak, dummy! Speak!

113
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:57,504
- Why don't you speak?
- Scared. Can't talk.

114
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,218
All right.

115
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,100
Get a hold of yourself.

116
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:05,436
Take a deep breath.

117
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,099
Let it out slowly.

118
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,225
And tell me, who are you?

119
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,943
I'm Leo Bloom.
I am an accountant.

120
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,235
I'm from Whitehall and Marx.
I was sent here to do your books,

121
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,200
and I'm terribly sorry
I caught you with the old lady.

122
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,035
"Caught you with the old lady"?

123
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,450
Come in, Mr Tact.

124
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:42,886
So, you're an accountant, huh?

125
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,929
- Yes, I am.
- Then account for yourself!

126
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,893
Do you believe in God?
Do you believe in gold?

127
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,013
Why are you looking up
old ladies' dresses?

128
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,391
- Bit of a pervert, eh?
- Uh!

129
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:54,815
Never mind, never mind. Do the books.
They're over there in that desk.

130
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,403
Top drawer.

131
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,277
I'll take your coat.

132
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:01,651
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

133
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,078
How dare you condemn me
without knowing all the facts!

134
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:13,420
- Mr Bialystock...
- Shut up!

135
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,507
I'm having a rhetorical conversation!

136
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,546
How humiliating.

137
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,510
Max Bialystock.

138
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,134
Max Bialystock.

139
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,636
You know who I used to be?

140
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:32,890
Max Bialystock, King of Broadway!
Six shows running at once!

141
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,272
Lunch at Delmonico's.

142
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,236
$200 suits.

143
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,441
You see this?

144
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,910
This once held a pearl
as big as your eye!

145
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,621
Look at me now. Look at me now!

146
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,617
I'm wearing a cardboard belt.

147
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,675
I used to have thousands of investors
begging, pleading

148
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,641
to put their money
in a Max Bialystock production.

149
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,056
Look at my investors now.

150
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:19,446
<i>Vo il Ã </i>! Hundreds of little old ladies
stopping off at Max Bialystock's office

151
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:23,407
to grab a last thrill
on the way to the cemetery.

152
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:38,130
You have exactly ten seconds
to change that look of disgusting pity

153
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,375
into one of enormous respect.

154
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,968
One, two...

155
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,679
Do the books, do the books.

156
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,509
I appreciate that, sir.

157
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,239
Window's so filthy,
can't tell whether it's day or night out there.

158
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:20,293
That's it, baby!
When you got it, flaunt it! Flaunt it!

159
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,544
Cough... cough.

160
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,884
Cough!

161
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,480
I assume you're making those cartoon noises
to attract my attention.

162
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,062
Am I correct in my assumption,
you fish-faced enemy of the people?

163
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,108
Oh, I hurt your feelings.

164
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,152
Good! What is it?

165
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,446
May I speak to you for a minute?

166
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,321
Go. You have 58 seconds.

167
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:55,297
Well, in glancing at your books,
I noticed that in the columns marked...

168
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,292
You have 48 seconds left.
Hurry, hurry.

169
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:01,505
- Oh, I glanced at your books, I noticed...
- 28 seconds. You're running out of time.

170
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:03,544
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...

171
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,589
Mr Bialystock, I cannot function
under these conditions!

172
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:09,304
You're making me extremely nervous!

173
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:13,013
- What is that, a handkerchief?
- What? Nothing. That's nothing.

174
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:16,387
- If it's nothing, why can't I see it?
- Argh!

175
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,481
My blanket! My blue blanket!
Give me my blue blanket!

176
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:23,148
Oh, you... No! You...

177
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,612
Shh! Here.

178
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,356
Don't panic, don't panic.

179
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:30,576
Mmh... mmh. Ah...

180
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,624
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,868
I don't like people
touching my blue blanket.

182
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:43,293
It's not important. It's a minor compulsion.
I can deal with it if I want to.

183
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,633
It's just that I've had it
ever since I was a baby, and...

184
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:48,548
I find it very comforting.

185
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:58,812
They come here.
They all come here.

186
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,024
- How do they find me?
- May I speak to you?

187
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,983
Yes, Prince Mishkin.

188
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,024
What can we do for you?

189
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:08,317
This is hardly a time for levity.

190
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:12,068
Mr Bialystock, I've discovered a serious
error here in the accounts of your last play.

191
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:13,319
Where? What?

192
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,197
Well, according to the backers list,
you raised $60,000,

193
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,699
but the play that you produced
only cost $58,000.

194
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,701
That's $2,000 unaccounted for.

195
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:24,126
I went to a Turkish bath.
Who cares? The play was a flop!

196
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,417
What difference does it make?

197
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,091
"What difference does it make"?
That's fraud!

198
00:15:28,219 --> 00:15:29,859
If they found out,
you could go to prison.

199
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,924
Who's gonna find out?
It's only $2,000.

200
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,469
Bloom, do me a favour.
Move a few decimal points around.

201
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,200
You can do it. You're an accountant.
You're in a noble profession.

202
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:39,724
The word "count" is part of your title.

203
00:15:39,856 --> 00:15:42,439
- That's cheating.
- It's not cheating!

204
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,603
It's charity.

205
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,526
Bloom, look at me.

206
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,190
Look at me, Bloom!

207
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,239
Bloom, I'm drowning.

208
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:56,278
Other men sail through life.
Bialystock has struck a reef.

209
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,206
Bloom, I'm going under.

210
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm being sunk by a society
that demands success,

211
00:16:04,255 --> 00:16:05,996
when all I can offer is failure.

212
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:09,546
Bloom, I'm reaching out to you.

213
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,628
Don't send me to prison.

214
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,597
Help!

215
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:21,136
Help me. Help me, Bloom.

216
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,934
Help me.

217
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,726
Yeah, I'll do it! I'll do it! I'll do it!

218
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:29,604
- Thank you. I knew I could con you.
- That's all right. What?

219
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:32,072
Nothing. Nothing. Do it. Do it.

220
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,238
Right. Let's see. $2,000.

221
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,905
$2,000.

222
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,119
Well, that isn't much.
I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.

223
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,453
After all, the Internal Revenue Service
isn't interested in a show that flopped.

224
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:48,296
Yes, right. Good thinking.
You figure it out.

225
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,259
I'm tired. I'm gonna take a little nap.
Wake me if there's a fire.

226
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,173
Let's see.

227
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:58,265
If we add these, we get ten, four...

228
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,136
Hmm...

229
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,183
Amazing.

230
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,432
It's absolutely amazing.

231
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,024
Under the right circumstances,

232
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:11,065
a producer could make more money
with a flop than he could with a hit.

233
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,031
Hmm...

234
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,324
Yes, it's quite possible.

235
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,570
If he were certain that the show would fail,
a man could make a fortune!

236
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,947
- Yes?
- Yes what?

237
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,621
- What you were saying, keep talking.
- What was I saying?

238
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,960
You were saying that
under the right circumstances,

239
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:30,581
a producer could make more money
with a flop than he could with a hit.

240
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,457
Yes, it's quite possible.

241
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,336
You keep saying that,
but you don't tell me how.

242
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:38,714
How can a producer make more money
with a flop than he could with a hit?

243
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,967
Well, it's simply a matter
of creative accounting.

244
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:45,437
Let's assume, just for the moment,
that you are a dishonest man.

245
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:47,181
- Assume away.
- It's very easy.

246
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,184
- You raise more money than you need.
- What do you mean?

247
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,027
Well, you did it yourself,
only you did it on a very small scale.

248
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,236
What'd I do?

249
00:17:54,365 --> 00:17:57,654
You raised $2,000 more than you needed
to produce your last play.

250
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:00,277
So? What did it get me?
I'm wearing a cardboard belt!

251
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,849
That's where you made your mistake.
You didn't go all the way.

252
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:06,833
You see, if you were really a bold criminal,
you could have raised $1 million.

253
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,294
But the play cost me only
$60,000 to produce.

254
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:10,422
And how long did it run?

255
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,039
- One night.
- You see?

256
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,756
Do you see what I'm trying to tell you?

257
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:17,298
You could have raised $1 million,
put on a $60,000 flop and kept the rest.

258
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,950
- But what if the play was a hit?
- Well, then you'd go to jail.

259
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,577
See, once the play's a hit,
you have to pay off all the backers,

260
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:26,016
and with so many backers, there could
never be enough profits to go around. Get it?

261
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,685
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

262
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,058
Ah-ha! So in order
for this scheme to work,

263
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,810
we'd have to find a sure-fire flop.

264
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:36,154
- What scheme?
- "What scheme"?

265
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:38,615
Your scheme, you bloody little genius!

266
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,279
I meant no scheme.

267
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:43,620
I merely posed a little academic
accounting theory. It was just a thought.

268
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:48,242
Bloom, worlds are turned
on such thoughts.

269
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:53,164
Don't you see, Bloom?
Darling Bloom. Glorious Bloom.

270
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:54,585
It's so simple.

271
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,801
Step one, we find the worst play in the world.
A sure-fire flop.

272
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:01,092
Step two, I raise $1 million.
There's a lot of old ladies in the world.

273
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,055
Step three, you go back
to work on the books,

274
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:05,597
phony list of backers,
one for the government, one for us.

275
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,594
You can do it, Bloom.
You're a wizard.

276
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,187
Step four, we open on Broadway.

277
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:12,274
And before you can say "step five",
we close on Broadway.

278
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:16,065
Step six, we take our $1 million,
we fly to Rio de Janeiro!

279
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,990
I'm an honest man.
You don't understand.

280
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,707
No, Bloom, <i>you</i> don't understand!

281
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,543
This is fate! This is destiny!
This is kismet!

282
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,129
There's no avoiding it.

283
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,169
Mr Bialystock, not more than
five minutes ago, I doctored your books!

284
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,339
That, sir, is the ultimate extent
of my criminal life!

285
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:43,305
Oh...

286
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,264
I want that money!

287
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:48,181
I fell on my keys.

288
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,810
You miserable, cowardly,
wretched, little caterpillar.

289
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,059
Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?

290
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:59,188
Don't you want to spread your wings
and flap your way to glory?

291
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,064
- You're gonna jump on me.
- Huh?

292
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,988
You're gonna jump on me!
I know you're gonna jump on me!

293
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,861
Like Nero jumped on Poppaea.

294
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:07,737
- Who?
- Poppaea!

295
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,910
She was his wife,
and she was unfaithful to him,

296
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,501
so he got mad and jumped on her
up and down, up and down,

297
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,040
until he squashed her like a bug!

298
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:18,503
- Please don't jump on me!
- I'm not gonna jump on you!

299
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,377
I'm not gonna jump on you!

300
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:24,846
- Will you get a hold of yourself?
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

301
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,591
Oh, my God, no, no...
Oh, no, no, no...

302
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,810
I'm not gonna hurt you.
What's the matter with you?

303
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:33,772
I'm hysterical!
I'm having hysterics. I'm hysterical.

304
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,358
I can't stop when I get like this.
I can't stop. I'm hysterical.

305
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,696
I'm wet! I'm wet!

306
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,989
I'm hysterical, and I'm wet!

307
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,909
I'm in pain!

308
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,123
And I'm wet!

309
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,913
And I'm still hysterical!

310
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:57,663
No, no, don't hit, don't hit. It doesn't help.
It only increases my sense of danger.

311
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,791
What can I do? What can I do?
You're getting me hysterical.

312
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,509
- Go away, go away. You frighten me.
- Where shall I go?

313
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,004
- Sit over there.
- OK.

314
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,507
OK.

315
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:11,100
OK. I'm over here.

316
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,515
- This better?
- That's better.

317
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,728
But you still look angry.

318
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,059
How's this?

319
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,525
Good.
That's good.

320
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,440
That's very nice.

321
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:29,612
I think I'm coming out of it now.

322
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,784
Ah.. yes.

323
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,782
I'm definitely coming out of it.

324
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,167
Ah...

325
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,912
Thank you for smiling.
That helped a great deal.

326
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:40,630
You know what they say:

327
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:45,048
"Smile and the world smiles with you."

328
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:47,671
This man should be in a straitjacket.

329
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:48,807
Feeling better?

330
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:52,722
Oh, much, thank you,
but I am a little lightheaded.

331
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,015
Maybe I should eat something.

332
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,811
Hysterical attacks have a way of severely
depleting one's blood sugar, you know?

333
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,560
They certainly do. They certainly do.

334
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,903
Come.
Let me take you to lunch.

335
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:15,787
You know, it's very nice of you
to take me to lunch, Mr Bialystock.

336
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:19,036
Call me Max. You know,
I don't let everybody call me Max.

337
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,755
- It's only those people I like.
- OK, Max.

338
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,751
- And you can call me Leo.
- I already have.

339
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,922
Oh.

340
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:30,297
Well, where shall we go for lunch?

341
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:35,302
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.
What do you think, Max?

342
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,850
Well, Leo,
it's such a beautiful day,

343
00:22:37,982 --> 00:22:40,440
why go to a dark, stuffy restaurant?

344
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:42,309
Let's dine al fresco.

345
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:45,187
- This is al fresco?
- The finest.

346
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,234
Thank you.

347
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,985
Mmh, excellent.
Please tender our compliments to the chef.

348
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,739
- Please tender half a buck.
- Of course. Here you are, my good man.

349
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:57,958
I'm not your good man.
I happen to own this establishment.

350
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,747
Give me the change.

351
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,501
Everybody's a big shot.

352
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,089
Well, Leo, what say
we promenade through the park?

353
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,463
I'd love to, but it's nearly two o'clock.
I should get back to Whitehall and Marx.

354
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:14,216
Nonsense!
As far as Whitehall and Marx is concerned,

355
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,139
- you're working with Max Bialystock, right?
- Right.

356
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,596
Then stick with Bialystock.

357
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:40,625
Lovely out here, isn't it?

358
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:44,212
I wish I could enjoy it.
I'm so nervous.

359
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,297
What if someone from the office
should see me?

360
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,589
Then you'd see them,
and why aren't they at the office?

361
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,922
That's right.

362
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,266
That's it, Leo. You're learning.

363
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:59,310
Having a good time?

364
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,397
I don't know.
I feel so strange.

365
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,607
Maybe you're happy.

366
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,522
That's it. I'm happy.

367
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:12,449
What do you know
about that?

368
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:13,908
I'm happy!

369
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:16,536
I'm happy!

370
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,661
There it is, Bloom.

371
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:24,582
The most exciting city in the world.

372
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,127
Thrills, adventure, romance.

373
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:32,093
Everything you ever dreamed of
is down there.

374
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,133
Big black limousines.

375
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,051
Gold cigarette cases.

376
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:39,426
Elegant ladies with long legs.

377
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,520
All you need is money, Bloom.

378
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,392
Money is honey. Money is honey.

379
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,650
- Leo, he who hesitates is poor.
- Mmh...

380
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,067
Don't let me influence you.
It's your decision.

381
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,239
But if we get caught,
we'll go to prison.

382
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,704
You think you're not in prison now?

383
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,245
Living in a grey, little room?

384
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:07,462
Going to a grey, little job?
Leading a grey, little life?

385
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:09,080
That's right.

386
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,378
I'm a nothing.

387
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,094
I spend my life counting
other people's money.

388
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,339
People I'm smarter than.

389
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,056
Better than.

390
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:21,885
Where's my share?

391
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,725
Where's Leo Bloom's share?

392
00:25:25,983 --> 00:25:27,474
I want...

393
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:29,859
I want...

394
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,650
I want everything I've ever seen
in the movies!

395
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,239
Leo, say you'll join me!

396
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,903
I'll do it!

397
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:41,117
- By God, I'll do it!
- He'll do it!

398
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,534
He'll do it!

399
00:25:45,836 --> 00:25:47,327
I'm Leo Bloom!

400
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,254
I'm me!

401
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,624
I can do whatever I want!

402
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,422
It doesn't matter!

403
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,010
I'm Leo Bloom!

404
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,077
Max, let's call it a night.

405
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,949
It's two in the morning.
I don't know what I'm reading anymore.

406
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:28,202
Read, read. We've got to find
the worst play ever written.

407
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,415
Ah!

408
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:36,213
"Gregor Samsa woke one morning

409
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:41,841
"to discover that he had been transformed
into a giant cockroach."

410
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,426
It's too good.

411
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,022
Wait a minute.

412
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:52,312
Wait a minute.

413
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,982
I've read this play.

414
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,607
I'm reading plays I read this morning.

415
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,450
I can't go on.

416
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:03,365
It's too much.

417
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:07,407
Max, let's face it, we'll never find it.

418
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,125
"We'll never find it", huh?

419
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:14,748
"We'll never find it",
huh?

420
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,419
"We'll never find it", huh?

421
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:19,295
"We'll never find it", huh?
"We'll never find..."

422
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:27,844
Leo...

423
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,308
Smell it.

424
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,306
See it?
Touch it, touch it.

425
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,185
- What is it?
- "What is it"? We've struck gold.

426
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,357
Not fool's gold, but real gold.

427
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,606
The mother lode, the mother lode.

428
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,316
The mother of them all.

429
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,193
Kiss it, kiss it.

430
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,164
- You found a flop.
- "A flop"! That's putting it mildly.

431
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,579
We've found a disaster,
a catastrophe, an outrage!

432
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:54,170
- A guaranteed-to-close-in-one-night beauty.
- Let's see it.

433
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,416
This is freedom from want forever.
This is a house in the country.

434
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:59,417
This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley.

435
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:02,466
This is wine, women,
and song... and women.

436
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,556
"Springtime for Hitler.

437
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,598
"A gay romp with Adolf and Eva
at Berchtesgaden."

438
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,392
- Wow!
- Wow!

439
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,766
It's practically a love letter to Hitler.

440
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:17,986
- This won't run a week.
- A week? Are you kidding?

441
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:21,402
This play has got to close on page four.

442
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:24,947
- Who wrote it?
- Who? Read, read. Right there. Read, read.

443
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,194
- "Franz..."
- Franz.

444
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,571
- "...Liebkind."
- Liebkind.

445
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,787
- "100..."
- 100.

446
00:28:28,916 --> 00:28:29,916
- "...West..."
- West.

447
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,269
- "...Jane Street."
- Jane Street.

448
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,409
Franz Liebkind.

449
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,911
100 West Jane Street.

450
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:46,677
- Who do you want?
- I beg your pardon?

451
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:47,844
Who do you want?

452
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,764
No one gets in the building
unless I know who they want.

453
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,478
I'm the concierge.

454
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:56,316
My husband used to be the concierge,
but he's dead.

455
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,355
Now I'm the concierge.

456
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,733
We are seeking Franz Liebkind.

457
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:04,153
Oh, the kraut!

458
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,617
He's on the top floor, apartment 23.

459
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,911
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

460
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,701
But you won't find him there.

461
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:14,075
He's up on the roof with his birds.

462
00:29:14,211 --> 00:29:16,453
He keeps birds.

463
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:21,708
Dirty, disgusting, filthy,
lice-ridden birds.

464
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,589
You used to be able to sit out
on the stoop like a person.

465
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:29,056
Not anymore. No, sir.

466
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,936
Birds!
You get my drift?

467
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:37,232
We get it. We get your drift.
Thank you, madam.

468
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,360
I'm not a madam!
I'm a concierge!

469
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,116
- He's wearing a German helmet.
- Shh!

470
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,790
Don't say anything to offend him.
We need that play.

471
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:11,933
- Franz Liebkind?
- I was never a member of the Nazi party!

472
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:15,053
I'm not responsible!
I only followed orders!

473
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,931
Who are you?
Why do you persecute me?

474
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,685
My papers are in order.
I love my adopted country.

475
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,785
What do you want?

476
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,653
Relax! Relax, Mr Liebkind.

477
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,577
We're not from the government.
We came here to talk about your play.

478
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,371
My play?

479
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,370
You mean, "Springtime for...
You-know-who"?

480
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,712
- Yes.
- What about it?

481
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:46,301
We love it. We think it's a masterpiece.
That's why we're here.

482
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,044
We wish to produce it on Broadway.

483
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,426
Broadway.

484
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:54,096
Oh... Oh, joy of joys!

485
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,936
Oh, dream of dreams.

486
00:30:57,064 --> 00:31:00,182
I can't believe it.
I must tell the birds.

487
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:03,151
Birds! Birds!
Birds, do you hear?

488
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,737
Otto! Berthe!
Heinz! Hans! Wolfgang!

489
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,905
Do you hear?
We are going to clear the FÃ¼hrer's name.

490
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,668
Mr Liebkind, Mr Liebkind, please.
People can hear.

491
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:34,387
This is not a place to talk.
Come, we'll go to my flat.

492
00:31:34,518 --> 00:31:38,512
An occasion like this
calls for schnapps!

493
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,413
You know, not many people knew it...

494
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,618
but the FÃ¼hrer was a terrific dancer.

495
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,835
Really? I never dreamed that...

496
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,085
That is because that you were taken in

497
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,678
by that <i>Verdammte</i> Allied propaganda!

498
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:14,843
Such filthy lies! They told lies!

499
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,601
But nobody ever said a bad word
about Winston Churchill, did they?

500
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,472
No! "Win with Winnie!"

501
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,022
Churchill!

502
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:29,612
With his cigars. With his brandy.

503
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,856
And his rotten painting, rotten!

504
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:34,029
Hitler, there was a painter.

505
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:38,030
He could paint an entire apartment
in one afternoon! Two coats!

506
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,910
Churchill.
He couldn't even say "Nazi".

507
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,584
He would say, "Noses. Noses."

508
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:50,504
It wasn't "Noses"! It was "Nazis"!

509
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,339
Churchill!

510
00:32:56,475 --> 00:33:00,845
- Exactly why...
- Let me tell you this!

511
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,517
And you're hearing this
straight from the horse!

512
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,231
Hitler was better-looking than Churchill.

513
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,692
He was a better dresser than Churchill.

514
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,277
He had more hair!

515
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:14,649
He told funnier jokes, and he could dance
the pants off of Churchill!

516
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,447
- Exactly why...
- Churchill!

517
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,413
Yes... yes. Churchill!

518
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:23,829
That's exactly why
we want to produce this play -

519
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,670
to show the world the true Hitler,
the Hitler you loved,

520
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,413
the Hitler you knew,

521
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:32,713
the Hitler with a song in his heart.

522
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,485
Here, Franz Liebkind, sign here,

523
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,781
and make your dream a reality.

524
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:03,623
Here it is! "Springtime for Hitler",
signed, sealed, and delivered.

525
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,083
- What's the matter?
- I'm not wearing this armband.

526
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,373
I don't care how big the deal is.
I won't wear it.

527
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,168
OK. Take it off, take it off.

528
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,929
Taxi!

529
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,430
The Blue Gypsy.

530
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,929
Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?

531
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,306
We are not going to the Blue Gypsy.

532
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,353
I am going to the Blue Gypsy.

533
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:33,148
I have a rendezvous
with a lady of some means.

534
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:41,323
You see, my dear Bloom,
phase one is complete.

535
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,615
The play is ours.

536
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:46,366
We are now entering phase two -
the raising of the money.

537
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:49,209
In the days to come,
you will see very little of me,

538
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:53,627
for Max Bialystock is launching himself
into little-old-lady land.

539
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,715
<i>A dieu. A Vanti!</i>

540
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,847
You're incorrigible, Bialy.

541
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:12,600
Here's to the success of your new play.

542
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,023
- Our new play, my love.
- Oh...

543
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:19,490
Oh, Bialy, I'm so sorry.

544
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:22,611
- Did I wet you?
- Think nothing of it, my dear.

545
00:35:22,746 --> 00:35:25,614
A mere trifle, a mere trifle.

546
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,706
Did you bring the checkie?

547
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,998
Oh, yes,
I have it right here in my purse.

548
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,214
And I made it out just like you told me.
To "cash".

549
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,959
That's a funny name for a play.

550
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,302
Think nothing of it, my dear.

551
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,550
- Thank you, my dear.
- Say it again, Bialy.

552
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,221
And I swear to you on my life,
you don't look a day over 65.

553
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,845
There you are.

554
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,103
- I love you.
- What?

555
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:37,560
I love you.

556
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,403
What?

557
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,568
- I love you!
- Oh!

558
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,200
Go, Bialy-baby, go!

559
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:03,173
'Who is it?'

560
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,170
It's Max Bialystock.

561
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,391
'Oh, good.
I thought it was a burglar.

562
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:11,636
'Wait. I'll let you in.'

563
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,393
Mrs Sarah Cathcart.

564
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,683
She owns 50 per cent of the profits.

565
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,316
Mrs Virginia Resnick.

566
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,982
She also owns 50 per cent of the profits.

567
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:06,195
Mrs Eleanor Biddlecomb.

568
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:08,659
She also owns 50 per cent of the profits.

569
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,037
Mrs Alma Wentworth.

570
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:14,703
She owns 100 per cent of the profits.

571
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,998
Leo, how much percentage of a play
can there be altogether?

572
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:21,213
Max, you can only sell
100 per cent of anything.

573
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:25,130
And how much of
"Springtime for Hitler" have we sold?

574
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,218
25,000 per cent.

575
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:30,761
25,000 per cent!

576
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,558
Give me that blue thing.

577
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:41,038
Max, where are you going?
We haven't finished signing the contracts.

578
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,067
I have to see that money.

579
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,538
Hello, boys.

580
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,041
If you only knew
what I went through for you.

581
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:04,461
- Max, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna buy myself a toy.

582
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,460
I worked very, very hard,
and I think I deserve a toy.

583
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,836
A toy?

584
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,088
A toy!

585
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,592
That's a toy?

586
00:39:14,727 --> 00:39:17,014
She happens to be
our new receptionist.

587
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,889
She goes with our new surroundings.

588
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,811
Ulla?

589
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,565
Ulla...

590
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,282
Ulla, I want you to meet my associate
and partner, Mr Leo Bloom.

591
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,901
<i>God dag pÃ¥ deg.</i>

592
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,870
- I beg your pardon?
<i>- God dag pÃ¥ deg.</i>

593
00:39:34,998 --> 00:39:37,866
Oh, <i>god dagen...</i>

594
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:41,369
Max, have you gone mad?
A receptionist that can't speak English?

595
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,961
What will people say?

596
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,673
They'll say, "Ah-woo-ah
wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha-wha."

597
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,293
- What is she going to do here?
- Shh!

598
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,011
I'll show you.

599
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:54,632
Ulla, go to work.

600
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,429
"Go to work."

601
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:24,078
Ulla, OK.

602
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:26,122
OK, Ulla.

603
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:30,877
Cream puff,
sweetie pie, pussycat, OK.

604
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,298
Ulla!

605
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:34,843
Stop work!

606
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:44,265
Would you believe it?
I met her at the public library.

607
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,852
Ulla.

608
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,239
Go to desk.
Answer telephone.

609
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,860
"Bialystock and Bloom.
Bialystock and Bloom."

610
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,284
Bialystock and Bloom.
Bialystock and Bloom.

611
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:00,701
<i>God dag pÃ¥ deg.</i>

612
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,496
Bialystock and Bloom.
<i>God dag pÃ¥ deg.</i>

613
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:05,210
Bialystock and Bloom.

614
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,000
<i>God dag pÃ¥ deg.</i>

615
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,838
Nice girl.

616
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,296
Hey, Bloom.

617
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,009
Take a cigar.

618
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,299
Max, maybe we should both...

619
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:18,595
- What's that?
- Nothing, nothing. Go on, go on.

620
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,852
Smart as a whip.

621
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,118
No, no, no, no...

622
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:44,829
No, no, no, no!

623
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,872
You Swedish tease.

624
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,791
<i>Min Bialystock.</i>

625
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:54,714
You'll bury me.

626
00:42:02,812 --> 00:42:04,804
Leo, what were you saying?

627
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,226
What? Oh, Max...

628
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,771
Maybe we should go
a little easier on the spending.

629
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:13,862
- I mean, these offices and all.
- Why? Take it when you can get it.

630
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,731
Flaunt it, baby! Flaunt it!

631
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,859
But if something should,
God forbid, go wrong,

632
00:42:17,994 --> 00:42:19,794
at least we could give back
some of the money.

633
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,453
I mean,
it would look better in court.

634
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:24,540
Stop talking like that,
you white mouse.

635
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,078
Nothing is gonna go wrong.

636
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,123
As a matter of fact, today,
I have taken steps to make sure

637
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,419
that "Springtime for Hitler"
will be a total disaster.

638
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:36,635
At two o'clock, we have an appointment
with none other than Roger de Bris.

639
00:42:36,763 --> 00:42:38,379
Roger de Bris?

640
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,177
What? Oh, the director.
Is he good?

641
00:42:41,309 --> 00:42:43,801
- I mean, is he bad?
- He stinks.

642
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,553
He's perhaps the worst director
that ever lived.

643
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:50,774
He's the only director whose plays
close on the first day of rehearsal.

644
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:55,237
- Do you think he'll take the job?
- Only if we ask him.

645
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,357
It's late. I'll get the car.

646
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,611
<i>Ja?</i>

647
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,114
Call chauffeur. Get car.

648
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,582
Good, good. We go to motel?

649
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,702
No, no, no. We go.

650
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:13,547
You and Mr Bloom go to motel?

651
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:15,791
No. No motel.

652
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,634
Get car. Get car.

653
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:21,506
Get car, get car.

654
00:43:21,641 --> 00:43:23,223
Get car.

655
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,564
Thank you, Rudolfo.

656
00:43:44,122 --> 00:43:46,580
Now, don't let anything
he says or does upset you.

657
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,289
He's a little peculiar.

658
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:51,376
- What do you mean?
- Yes?

659
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:57,292
I am Max Bialystock.
This is my associate, Mr Bloom.

660
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,668
We have an appointment
with Mr de Bris.

661
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:03,138
Oh, yes, you are expected.
Please do come in.

662
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:14,809
How do you do?

663
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,028
I'm Carmen Giya,
Monsieur de Bris' private secretary.

664
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:19,772
Would you please remove your shoes?

665
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:26,160
White, white, white
is the colour of our carpet.

666
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,742
Will you please follow me?

667
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,068
Oh.

668
00:45:25,223 --> 00:45:26,589
Please.

669
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,520
We're not alone!

670
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,402
Please sit down.

671
00:45:41,364 --> 00:45:43,276
Roger?

672
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:47,196
Ah! Messrs Bialystock and Bloom,
I presume?

673
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:48,864
Forgive the pun.

674
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,453
- What pun?
- Shut up. He thinks he's witty.

675
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,084
Good to see you again, Roger.

676
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,955
Did you get a chance to read
"Springtime for Hitler"?

677
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,090
Remarkable.

678
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:02,169
Remarkable!

679
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,344
A stunning piece of work.

680
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,597
Max, he's wearing a dress.

681
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:11,675
No kidding.

682
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:16,181
I, for one, think
it is a very important play.

683
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:23,813
Do you know, I never realised
that the Third Reich meant Germany!

684
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:28,067
I mean, it's drenched
with historical goodies like that.

685
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,537
Oh, dear...
You're staring at my dress.

686
00:46:33,374 --> 00:46:35,115
I should explain.

687
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:37,709
I'm going to the
choreographer's ball tonight.

688
00:46:37,837 --> 00:46:41,626
- There is a prize for the best costume.
- And we always win.

689
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,714
I'm not so sure about tonight.

690
00:46:43,843 --> 00:46:47,007
I'm supposed to be
the Grand Duchess Anastasia,

691
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:49,972
but I think I look more like Tugboat Annie.
What do you think?

692
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:51,761
- Well...
- Now, be cruel.

693
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,852
Be brutal. Be brutal!
Because, heaven knows, they will.

694
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,848
Well? What do you think,
Mr Bloom?

695
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,237
Where do you keep your wallet?

696
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:10,029
It's gorgeous. It's gorgeous.
You couldn't have picked a better colour.

697
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:15,281
It brings out your eyes.
Let's face it, Roger, that dress is you.

698
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:19,626
- Do you really think it brings out my eyes?
- We can't tell a thing without your wig.

699
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,747
As far as I'm concerned,
you're only half-dressed.

700
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,919
Well, if you're so worried
about the wig, get it,

701
00:47:25,051 --> 00:47:27,759
O Wicked Witch of the West.

702
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,342
- He likes you.
- I don't want to...

703
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,026
Didn't I meet you on a summer cruise?

704
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,536
Mmh...

705
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,997
I've never been on a summer cruise.

706
00:48:01,128 --> 00:48:03,871
<i>A h! Quel dommage.</i>

707
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,634
Oh, I see we're getting acquainted.

708
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:11,845
How would you like to go back
to teasing hair, big mouth?

709
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,554
Later, Roger.

710
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:17,016
Roger, do you mind
if we talk a little business?

711
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:21,388
Oh, please, please.
That is what we are here for.

712
00:48:21,524 --> 00:48:25,859
I think this would be
a marvellous opportunity for you, Roger.

713
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,353
Be careful. That hurt!

714
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,027
Up to now, you've always
been associated with musicals.

715
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,447
Yes! Dopey showgirls with gooey gowns.

716
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,787
"Two, three, kick, turn.
Turn, turn, kick, turn!"

717
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:39,406
It's enough to make you puke.

718
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:40,874
Roger.

719
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,585
But now, at last,
a chance to do straight drama.

720
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:48,210
Roger de Bris presents history.

721
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:53,678
Of course,
I think we should add a little music,

722
00:48:53,806 --> 00:48:56,219
and that whole third act has got to go.

723
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,226
They're losing the war.
It's too depressing.

724
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,435
We shall have to put something in there.

725
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,101
What?

726
00:49:07,236 --> 00:49:09,319
I see it! I see it!

727
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:13,657
A line of beautiful girls
dressed as storm troopers,

728
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,616
black patent leather boots,

729
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,110
- S-M.
- Love it.

730
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:19,408
All marching together!

731
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:22,203
"Two, three, kick, turn.
Turn, turn, kick, turn..."

732
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,666
It will work!

733
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,707
That is genius! Genius!

734
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,331
I think I speak for Mr Bloom
and myself when I say

735
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:33,336
you're the only man in the world
who can do justice to "Springtime for Hitler".

736
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,929
Wait a minute.
This is a very big decision.

737
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:38,969
It might affect the course of my entire life.

738
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,593
I shall have to think about it.

739
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:44,597
- I'll do it.
- Congratulations and thank you.

740
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:47,270
Get on the phone!
Send out a casting call!

741
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:51,566
Call every agent in town!
I want to see everybody, everybody!

742
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,711
Heil!

743
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,811
This is bedlam! Bedlam!

744
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,768
We must have some order!

745
00:50:29,485 --> 00:50:32,649
Whoa, whoa... whoa!

746
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,319
Will the dancing Hitlers
please wait in the wings?

747
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,407
We are only seeing singing Hitlers.

748
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:49,002
Arthur Packard.

749
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:56,422
Hello, Arthur.
Tell us something about yourself.

750
00:50:56,554 --> 00:51:00,548
I was the lead tenor
of the Albuquerque Opera Company

751
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:02,470
for the last two seasons.

752
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,514
I just finished the road tour of "Lilac Time",

753
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,347
and last season,
I was up for the lead

754
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,600
in the Broadway production
of "The Gypsy Lover".

755
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,021
What happened?

756
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,610
I didn't get it.

757
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:16,900
Well, Arthur, what are you going
to sing for us?

758
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:21,117
I would like to sing
"A Wandering Minstrel I".

759
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:22,745
Verywell.

760
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,713
Next, please!

761
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:41,213
Jason Green. Please.

762
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:47,268
Well, Jason, and what
have you been up to lately?

763
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,815
For the last 16 years,
I have been touring with the USO.

764
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:52,942
Well...

765
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,213
And what are you going to sing for us?

766
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:57,775
"Have You Ever Heard
The German Band?"

767
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,272
No.

768
00:51:59,408 --> 00:52:02,742
That's the name of the song
I am going to sing.

769
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,327
Oh...

770
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,781
You will play it!

771
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:40,071
"The Little Wooden Boy".

772
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:56,789
- Oh! Does that mean that I don't get...
- I'm sorry.

773
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,790
You're sorry?

774
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,186
Well, that's it.

775
00:53:18,654 --> 00:53:21,067
- Hey, man.
- I beg your pardon?

776
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:25,113
Is this where they're auditioning
"Boomerang", baby?

777
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,203
I'm afraid you wandered
into the wrong theatre.

778
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:33,792
Oh, man, not again!
Freaked out again.

779
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,455
Wait! Wait!

780
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,954
This is "Boomerang", this is "Boomerang".

781
00:53:38,090 --> 00:53:41,049
- What are you saying?
- Let's hear him. What have we got to lose?

782
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,758
All right.

783
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,627
- Young man...
- Yes, man?

784
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,299
What is your name?

785
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,433
Oh, man. My name?

786
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,554
I know my...

787
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,228
Lorenzo! Lorenzo, baby.

788
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:01,273
Lorenzo St. Dubois,
but my friends call me LSD.

789
00:54:01,405 --> 00:54:04,773
- And what have you done, LSD?
- Man, about six months.

790
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,028
But I'm on probation,
and I'm cool, man. I'm straight.

791
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:09,494
I mean, what do you do best?

792
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,988
Hey, man, I can't do that here.

793
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,615
That's why they put me away, baby.

794
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:15,788
Oh, sing, sing.

795
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,605
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so very much.

796
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:18,836
We're gonna sing.

797
00:54:18,964 --> 00:54:22,082
If I may, I'd like to call on my group.
They kind of help me a little.

798
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,129
Group! Come on, fellas.

799
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,423
I would like to sing this song.

800
00:54:26,555 --> 00:54:29,969
It's about love... and hate.

801
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,935
Psychedelically speaking,
I am talking about "the power".

802
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,896
That's our Hitler!

803
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,388
Your Highness.

804
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:13,730
There's <i>The Times '</i> drama critic.

805
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:18,530
Watch closely as Max Bialystock
puts the last nail into the coffin.

806
00:58:18,662 --> 00:58:21,621
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

807
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,832
Always delighted to greet
the gentlemen of the press.

808
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,292
Here you are, sir.

809
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:29,379
Two on the aisle,
compliments of the management.

810
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,838
Thank you.

811
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:34,835
Wait, wait... Wait a moment.
There seems to be some mistake.

812
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:38,134
There's a $100-bill
wrapped around these tickets.

813
00:58:38,265 --> 00:58:40,131
That's no mistake.

814
00:58:40,267 --> 00:58:42,304
Enjoy the show.

815
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:45,975
Mr Bialystock,
just what do you think you're doing?

816
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:48,063
I'm bribing you.

817
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,855
Just play ball,
there's a lot more where that came from.

818
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,961
Fix this button.

819
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:22,302
Straight! Up! Up! Always up!

820
00:59:26,188 --> 00:59:30,523
Gentlemen, it is magic time.
Good luck.

821
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,357
Good luck.

822
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:36,984
Tonight, Broadway, tomorrow...

823
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,612
So much for Nazi failure.

824
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,834
He'll kill us.

825
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,758
Max, come on, the overture's started.

826
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:06,597
Well, Max...

827
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,979
This is it!

828
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,940
Sorry. I'm a little nervous.

829
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:16,027
Relax. In two hours,
our worries will be over.

830
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,700
Well!

831
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:15,698
Talk about bad taste!

832
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:49,277
Yeah!

833
01:03:54,873 --> 01:03:56,865
Come, let us repair
to the bar across the street.

834
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,040
We don't want to be caught here
during intermission.

835
01:03:59,169 --> 01:04:01,331
They'll stone us to death.

836
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,094
<i>Er liebt mich, er liebt mich nicht.</i>

837
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:13,259
<i>Er liebt mich, er liebt mich nicht.</i>

838
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,057
<i>Er liebt mich nicht!</i>

839
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,430
Hey, man...

840
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:25,105
I <i>lieb</i> you. I <i>lieb</i> you, baby.
I <i>lieb</i> you!

841
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,647
Now <i>lieb</i> me alone.

842
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,864
Harry, he's funny.

843
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:33,200
Hey, Maureen, come!

844
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:38,079
If you <i>lieb</i> me so much,

845
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:41,372
why don't you pay attention to me,
you big dictator?

846
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:45,295
Oh, you chicks!
Oh, you chicks! You're all alike!

847
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:48,666
All you think about is
<i>lieben, lieben, lieben, lieben!</i>

848
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:51,465
Don't you forget, baby,
I took an oath.

849
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,758
<i>Deutschland Ã¼ber alles!</i>

850
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:56,344
- Ah.
- So, cool it,

851
01:04:56,476 --> 01:04:58,388
while I map out my campaign.

852
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:37,514
<i>Heil!</i>

853
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,687
Did you see the look
on that woman's face?

854
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:48,730
When the guy started to sing...

855
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:57,989
Shh!

856
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:02,582
Here's to the one and only performance
of "Springtime for Hitler".

857
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,746
May it rest in peace.

858
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:11,965
Innkeeper! Innkeeper!

859
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:14,005
Another round of drinks here.

860
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,882
As a matter of fact, a round of drinks
for everybody in the place.

861
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:24,766
Just think...

862
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:28,482
Yesterday,
I was a meaningless little accountant,

863
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:31,774
and today I'm the producer
of a Broadway flop!

864
01:06:31,905 --> 01:06:35,740
Well, here's to failure.

865
01:06:35,867 --> 01:06:37,233
To failure.

866
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:40,736
Oh, thank you.
It's very kind of you.

867
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:54,546
<i>BitteschÃ¶n, mein FÃ¼hrer.</i>

868
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:58,094
Hey, man, you're a German!

869
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:01,215
We're all Germans!

870
01:07:02,769 --> 01:07:04,601
That's right!

871
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:07,767
That means we cannot attack Germany.

872
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,356
I mean, I got all my friends here,
you know?

873
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:17,231
And what about me?

874
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,951
And then there's the country club
and the laughs every night...

875
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,911
We got to do something.
I got it!

876
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,908
I've got it! I've got it! I've got it!
I've got it!

877
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:31,037
- What have you got?
- A medal. It fell down my pants, man.

878
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,629
Get it out, baby.

879
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,881
<i>DankeschÃ¶n,</i> baby.

880
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:38,423
"Baby. Baby."

881
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,091
Why does he say this "baby"?

882
01:07:40,223 --> 01:07:43,432
The FÃ¼hrer has never said "baby".
I did not write "baby".

883
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,643
What is it with this "baby"?

884
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,432
Will you please shut up?

885
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:50,227
You shut up.
You are the audience.

886
01:07:50,358 --> 01:07:53,351
I am the author. I outrank you!

887
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,777
Barkeep! Barkeep!

888
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,238
Another drink for myself...

889
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:00,358
my associate, Mr Bloom...

890
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:07,448
And don't forget
our good-natured inebriate over here.

891
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,541
Eternally grateful.

892
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:21,632
- A toast!
- A toast!

893
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:23,471
A toast!

894
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,424
To what?

895
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:26,801
To...

896
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:31,309
To toast. I love toast.

897
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:33,854
- To toast.
- To toast.

898
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,067
I'll take the lead,

899
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:48,618
and I want you right behind
me all the way!

900
01:09:26,204 --> 01:09:27,866
Bye!

901
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,083
It's intermission! Quick!

902
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:39,878
Hide your faces.
They'll tear us to pieces.

903
01:09:43,513 --> 01:09:46,005
- Give us a couple of Manhattans.
- I'll have a Manhattan.

904
01:09:47,058 --> 01:09:49,471
- Here you go, Frank.
- You getting it? Good boy!

905
01:09:49,602 --> 01:09:51,468
Two whisky sours, please.

906
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:55,143
Well, so far, that's about one of the
funniest things I've ever seen on Broadway.

907
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:58,893
- I never laughed so much in my life.
- Absolutely hysterical!

908
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:01,736
I thought I'd split my sides!

909
01:10:03,366 --> 01:10:05,528
Take it easy. Don't panic.

910
01:10:05,660 --> 01:10:07,276
There are a lot of plays on this street.

911
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:10,120
They aren't necessarily
talking about "Springtime for Hitler".

912
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:14,492
Would you ever believe you'd love
a show called "Springtime for Hitler"?

913
01:10:16,671 --> 01:10:18,253
Hey, come on, let's get back!

914
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:21,340
If the second act is anything like the first,
this'll run for five years!

915
01:10:27,932 --> 01:10:30,424
Gotta think. Gotta think.

916
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:33,845
Mrs Cathcart, 50 per cent.

917
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,097
Mrs Resnick, 50 per cent.

918
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:37,768
Gotta think.

919
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,938
- Mrs Biddlecomb, 50 per cent.
- Gotta think. Gotta think.

920
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,813
Mrs Wentworth, 100 per cent.

921
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:51,950
- Leo.
- No way out.

922
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:53,242
- Leo.
- No way...

923
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:54,455
Leo.

924
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,084
- No way...
- Leo, listen.

925
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:00,499
Let's go to the theatre
and see what's really happening.

926
01:11:00,631 --> 01:11:03,874
After all, we only heard from
a small portion of the audience.

927
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:07,549
Let's hear what the majority thinks.

928
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:11,720
- The majority?
- The majority.

929
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,184
- Let's hear from the majority.
- Yeah, the majority.

930
01:11:14,312 --> 01:11:16,053
- Where's the majority?
- Majority.

931
01:11:16,189 --> 01:11:18,306
- Let's hear the majority.
- The majority.

932
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:20,148
- See the majority?
- The majority.

933
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,796
- Where's the majority?
- The majority.

934
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:50,929
Excuse me. Excuse me.

935
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,891
The play here is in progress!
You must be quiet!

936
01:11:54,018 --> 01:11:55,930
Swine! Swine!

937
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,517
Oh, man, we're losing everything!
Everything!

938
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,485
Where's my Goebbels?
Where's my Goebbels?

939
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:08,401
Where's my Goebbels?
Get me my little Joe!

940
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:09,899
Send for Goebbels!

941
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:14,404
- Send for Goebbels!
- Send for Goebbels!

942
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,161
- Heil, baby!
- Hey, baby!

943
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,296
What's happening?

944
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,085
I just laid the morning propaganda
programmes on the people.

945
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:28,459
You're putting me on!
What did they say?

946
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,052
I told the people we invaded England!

947
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:34,093
Hey, that's a groove, daddy!
How did we come out?

948
01:12:34,225 --> 01:12:35,932
We beat 'em, baby!

949
01:12:36,060 --> 01:12:38,097
Groovy! That's my Joe!
That's my little Joe.

950
01:12:38,229 --> 01:12:40,141
I love my little Joe.

951
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:42,223
Joseph?

952
01:12:42,358 --> 01:12:45,066
You are smoking
in the presence of the FÃ¼hrer.

953
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:46,935
I'm sorry, big daddy.

954
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:51,568
They try.

955
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:53,818
Man, how they try.

956
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,449
<i>- Ja!</i>
- Hey, what can I do for you?

957
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:59,869
You will please be unconscious.

958
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,122
This is an outrage.
It must stop.

959
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,120
It makes me so mad what they do.

960
01:13:05,256 --> 01:13:06,872
Curtain must go down! Down!

961
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,420
Hey, what's happening?

962
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,265
I am the author of this play!

963
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,350
You are the victims of a hoax!

964
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:23,017
These are not my words!
The FÃ¼hrer has never said this "baby"!

965
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:26,358
The FÃ¼hrer was sweet!
The FÃ¼hrer was kind!

966
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:28,351
The FÃ¼hrer was good!

967
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:32,731
Oh, he loved me!
Often, often he would say to me,

968
01:13:32,867 --> 01:13:35,200
"Franz... Ow!"

969
01:14:05,316 --> 01:14:06,773
Boo-boo?

970
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:08,900
Boo-boo?

971
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,522
- Yeah?
- We make love?

972
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:17,446
No. We don't make love.

973
01:14:17,578 --> 01:14:19,240
Go to work.

974
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:47,438
"Congratulations.

975
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:49,853
"It's the biggest hit on Broadway."

976
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:53,270
"Congratulations.

977
01:14:53,406 --> 01:14:55,568
"Hitler will run forever."

978
01:14:57,368 --> 01:14:58,825
"Congratulations."

979
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,616
"Congratulations." "Congratulations."

980
01:15:01,747 --> 01:15:03,613
"Congratulations."

981
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,287
Congratulations!

982
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:09,253
Have you seen the lines
at the box office?

983
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:11,372
It's a torrent!
It's an avalanche!

984
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,339
It's the biggest hit on Broadway!

985
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,460
You lousy fruit! You ruined me!

986
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:21,465
You're crazy! He's gonna kill me!
Call the police! Call the police!

987
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,434
Help! Help!
Murder! Murder! Rape!

988
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,348
Don't let anybody in.

989
01:15:30,484 --> 01:15:32,567
Got to think.

990
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:34,027
I got to think.

991
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:39,991
How could this happen?

992
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:43,070
I was so careful.

993
01:15:43,205 --> 01:15:45,538
I picked the wrong play,

994
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:48,204
the wrong director, the wrong cast.

995
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,827
Where did I go right?

996
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:57,918
What are you doing?

997
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,795
Don't try to stop me.
I've made up my mind.

998
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:01,867
What are you doing with the books?
Where are you going?

999
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:03,723
I'm turning myself in.
It's the only way.

1000
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,412
I'm gonna cooperate with the authorities.

1001
01:16:05,436 --> 01:16:07,456
They'll reduce my sentence,
there's time off for good behaviour,

1002
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,097
and maybe I'll get a job
in the prison library. So long.

1003
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:11,939
Leo. Leo...

1004
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:13,275
Leo, Leo, Leo...

1005
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,110
Leo, Leo, take it easy. Relax.

1006
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:18,525
You're overwrought.
You don't know what you're doing.

1007
01:16:18,657 --> 01:16:21,400
You're acting out of panic.
Give me those books!

1008
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,242
I never should have listened to you!

1009
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:24,986
I never should have
listened to you!

1010
01:16:25,122 --> 01:16:28,786
- Oh, how I hate you!
- Double, double, double!

1011
01:16:36,342 --> 01:16:40,677
Fat! Fat!

1012
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,512
You fatty!

1013
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,597
Give me those books, you fat walrus!

1014
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,887
- Never!
- Give 'em quick!

1015
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:51,480
- You fat fatty, give me those fat books!
- No! No!

1016
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:57,069
You have broken the sacred oath!
You must die!

1017
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:08,200
This is not good here.

1018
01:17:08,332 --> 01:17:10,119
I am not killing you.

1019
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:13,244
Don't you understand?
You must die.

1020
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,837
Will you cooperate?

1021
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:17,831
- Come in!
- Come in!

1022
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,797
I hear noise. You call?

1023
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,670
Where are y...

1024
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:27,466
Boo!

1025
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:29,388
I see you.

1026
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:32,058
You like something? Coffee?

1027
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,805
Coffee.

1028
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,649
Yes! Good idea.

1029
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:39,190
Ask the gentleman with the gun...

1030
01:17:40,573 --> 01:17:45,113
the gentleman who is shooting at us
and trying to kill us,

1031
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:47,076
what he will have.

1032
01:17:49,874 --> 01:17:51,991
You like coffee?

1033
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,622
<i>Kaffee? Ja.</i>

1034
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,210
Black, two sugars.

1035
01:17:56,338 --> 01:18:00,503
Two regular,
one black, two sugar. Good.

1036
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:11,969
- Champagne?
- No, thanks. I have just ordered <i>Kaffee.</i>

1037
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,104
Argh!

1038
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,901
Are you coming out
from behind this desk or not?

1039
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:22,021
- Not!
- Cowards!

1040
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,944
Miserable, cringing cowards!

1041
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:27,616
Clinging to life! Watch!

1042
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,408
Watch and remember!

1043
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,079
Franz Liebkind
will show you how to die like a man!

1044
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:48,718
Soon I will be with <i>mein FÃ¼hrer.</i>

1045
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:51,432
And GÃ¶ring! And Goebbels!

1046
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:52,892
And Himmler!

1047
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,387
I'm coming, boys!

1048
01:18:57,524 --> 01:18:59,231
Ugh!

1049
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:01,898
Boy, when things go wrong...

1050
01:19:07,243 --> 01:19:11,658
Wasted a whole day
playing hide-and-seek with a crazy kraut!

1051
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:13,325
Ow!

1052
01:19:14,875 --> 01:19:18,243
- There, there.
- Where? Where?

1053
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:22,084
You crazy lunatic,
what are you shooting at us for?

1054
01:19:22,216 --> 01:19:24,096
Why don't you use this
where it'll do some good?

1055
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:25,494
Why don't you shoot at the actors?

1056
01:19:29,473 --> 01:19:31,180
Franz...

1057
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,641
Have I ever steered you wrong?

1058
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,101
Always.

1059
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:37,562
Never mind. Listen.

1060
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:41,559
Every night, people are laughing
at your beloved FÃ¼hrer. Why?

1061
01:19:41,694 --> 01:19:44,732
It is... It is that LSD.

1062
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,980
<i>Und</i> his <i>Verdammte</i> "babies"!

1063
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,651
Here. Here!

1064
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:53,160
Buy bullets.

1065
01:19:53,289 --> 01:19:56,373
Go. Kill.
Kill the actors.

1066
01:19:56,959 --> 01:19:58,951
- What?
- Shut up!

1067
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:02,750
The actors.
I must destroy the actors.

1068
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,920
Stop! This is insanity!
Have you lost your mind?

1069
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,612
How can you kill the actors?
What do you mean, "kill the actors"?

1070
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:11,630
Actors are not animals.
They're human beings.

1071
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,927
They are?
Have you ever eaten with one?

1072
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,676
Go! Go, kill! Forward!

1073
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:20,055
- No!
- Make up your minds!

1074
01:20:20,190 --> 01:20:23,274
What are you doing? We're trapped!
It's either the show or us!

1075
01:20:23,402 --> 01:20:27,112
There's no way out!
What can we do, blow up the theatre?

1076
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,913
- Dynamite.
- Dynamite.

1077
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,335
Dynamite.

1078
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,220
- Fuse.
- Fuse.

1079
01:20:52,348 --> 01:20:53,384
Fuse.

1080
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,188
Right.

1081
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,603
And now for the master connection.

1082
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:49,561
Don't shoot! It's the dynamite.

1083
01:21:49,696 --> 01:21:53,781
If you shoot it,
it will get mad at us and blow us all up.

1084
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,901
That is good thinking.

1085
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:57,823
I will put this dynamite back.

1086
01:21:57,955 --> 01:21:59,071
Good.

1087
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,742
Next time I produce a play, no author.

1088
01:22:08,715 --> 01:22:10,957
- Max?
- What is it?

1089
01:22:11,093 --> 01:22:13,005
- Max?
- What?

1090
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:15,800
Remember yesterday
in the office when we were fighting?

1091
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:17,092
So?

1092
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:20,850
I'm sorry I called you "fat, fat, fat".

1093
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,442
Gentlemen.

1094
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:34,190
We have here a technical problem.

1095
01:22:34,324 --> 01:22:40,821
I do not know whether this little devil
here is the quick fuse or the slow fuse.

1096
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,289
I must find this out.

1097
01:22:54,928 --> 01:22:56,510
This is critical.

1098
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:09,599
<i>A h, ja, ja</i>. You see this?

1099
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,603
You see this?
Hear what I have told you?

1100
01:23:12,738 --> 01:23:15,776
<i>Ja</i>. This is an example
of smartness here.

1101
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:20,653
I have said that this is the quick fuse,
and this is the quick fuse.

1102
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:24,118
The quick fuse!

1103
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,724
Has the jury reached a verdict?

1104
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,181
We have, Your Honour.

1105
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:47,770
How does the jury find?

1106
01:23:48,524 --> 01:23:51,437
We find the defendants incredibly guilty.

1107
01:23:51,568 --> 01:23:54,606
Do the defendants
have anything to say in their behalf

1108
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,025
before the court pronounces sentence?

1109
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:01,075
I would like to say something,
Your Honour.

1110
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:04,913
Not on my behalf, but in reference
to my partner, Mr Bialystock.

1111
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:06,910
Proceed.

1112
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,658
Your Honour,

1113
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:11,745
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

1114
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:16,750
Max Bialystock is the most...

1115
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:22,263
selfish man I ever met in my life.

1116
01:24:22,391 --> 01:24:23,927
Don't help me.

1117
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,096
Not only is he a liar...

1118
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,595
and a cheat...

1119
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,728
and a scoundrel and a crook...

1120
01:24:33,694 --> 01:24:37,187
who has taken money
from little old ladies,

1121
01:24:37,322 --> 01:24:42,317
but he's also talked people
into doing things, especially me,

1122
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:47,743
that they would never in a thousand years
have dreamed of doing.

1123
01:24:49,167 --> 01:24:51,580
But, Your Honour,

1124
01:24:51,712 --> 01:24:53,704
as I understand it,

1125
01:24:54,756 --> 01:25:01,720
the law was created
to protect people from being wronged.

1126
01:25:03,890 --> 01:25:06,132
Your Honour,

1127
01:25:06,268 --> 01:25:10,603
whom has Max Bialystock wronged?

1128
01:25:10,731 --> 01:25:12,472
I mean,

1129
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,600
whom has he really hurt?

1130
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:16,351
Not me.

1131
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:18,940
Not me.

1132
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,688
I was...

1133
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,234
This man...

1134
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:29,789
No one ever called me Leo before.

1135
01:25:29,916 --> 01:25:32,283
I mean,
I know it's not a big legal point,

1136
01:25:32,419 --> 01:25:36,459
but even in kindergarten,
they used to call me Bloom.

1137
01:25:37,341 --> 01:25:40,084
I never sang a song before.
I mean with someone else.

1138
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:42,585
I never sang a song
with someone else before.

1139
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:45,049
This man...

1140
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:47,761
This man...

1141
01:25:48,894 --> 01:25:50,931
This is a wonderful man.

1142
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:54,689
He made me what I am today.

1143
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,983
He did.

1144
01:25:59,613 --> 01:26:01,570
And what of the dear ladies?

1145
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:06,283
What would their lives have been
without Max Bialystock?

1146
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,407
Max Bialystock...

1147
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:13,207
who made them feel young...

1148
01:26:14,378 --> 01:26:16,335
and attractive...

1149
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,921
and wanted again.

1150
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:25,177
That's all that I have to say.

1151
01:26:30,435 --> 01:26:32,518
Order. Order.

1152
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:39,859
And may I humbly add, Your Honour,
that we've learned our lesson,

1153
01:26:39,986 --> 01:26:42,069
and that we'll never do it again.

1154
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:48,109
<i>Eins, zwei, drei, Vier.</i>

1155
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:09,547
Now, come on, guys,
let's put a little life in it.

1156
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,195
You now own 20 per cent of
"Prisoners of Love". Congratulations.

1157
01:27:28,326 --> 01:27:29,658
Yes, sir?

1158
01:27:35,542 --> 01:27:38,785
You now own 30 per cent of
"Prisoners of Love". Congratulations.

1159
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,536
Yes, sir?

1160
01:27:40,672 --> 01:27:45,918
Erm, the warden would like to make
a little investment in your production.

1161
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,381
Er...

1162
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:53,382
Tell him he owns 50 per cent of the show.

1163
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:54,804
- Thanks!
- My pleasure.

1164
01:27:55,437 --> 01:27:57,144
From the top, Franz. Once more.

1165
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,059
<i>Eins, zwei, drei, und...</i>

1166
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:16,122
We open in Leavenworth Saturday night!
