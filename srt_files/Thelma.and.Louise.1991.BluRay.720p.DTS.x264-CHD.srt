1
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:19,179
<i>Little honey,</i>
<i>are you goin' out tonight?</i>

2
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,890
Sonny,
you wanna hit me up
with some syrup?

3
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,101
Thank you, darling.

4
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:27,938
Ma'am?
Yeah, I'll be
right with you.

5
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,569
Here you go.
You got the sausage,
pancakes for you,

6
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,903
and there's your syrup.

7
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,613
He's over there.
Uh-huh.

8
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,618
Decaf or regular?

9
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,370
Regular, please.

10
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,873
You girls are kind of
young to be smoking,
don't you think?

11
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,499
It ruins
your sex drive.

12
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,221
I'll get it!

13
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,726
I got it! Hello?

14
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:08,478
Hey, how you doing,
little housewife?
You all packed?

15
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,855
We're out
of here tonight.

16
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,691
Well, wait now.
I still have to ask
Darryl if I can go.

17
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,776
You mean you haven't
asked him, yet?

18
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,154
Thelma,
for Christ's sake!

19
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,907
Thelma,
is he your husband
or your father?

20
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,367
It is just two days,
for God's sake.

21
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,454
Don't be a child.
Tell him
you're going with me.

22
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,539
Tell him I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

23
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,249
That don't carry much
weight with Darryl.

24
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,460
He already thinks
you're out of your mind.

25
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:33,086
Are you at work?

26
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,796
<i>No, I'm calling from</i>
<i>the Playboy Mansion.</i>

27
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,548
I'll call you right back.

28
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,884
Darryl?

29
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:41,929
Darryl!

30
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,264
Honey,
you better
hurry up!

31
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,146
God damn it, Thelma.

32
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,649
Don't holler like that.

33
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,196
Haven't I told you
I can't stand it

34
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,614
when you holler
in the morning?

35
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:03,951
I'm sorry, doll.
I just didn't
want you to be late.

36
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,661
Thank you.

37
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,125
Hon?
What?

38
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,462
Uh...

39
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,006
Have a good day
at work today.

40
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,424
Uh-huh.

41
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,052
Jesus.

42
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,054
Thank you, no.

43
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:28,558
Hon?

44
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:30,519
What?

45
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:33,855
You want anything special
for dinner tonight?

46
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,735
No, Thelma,
I don't give a shit
what we have for dinner.

47
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,447
I may not even
make it home for dinner.
You know how Fridays are.

48
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:48,036
Yeah, funny how
so many people want to buy
a carpet on a Friday night.

49
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:52,124
You'd almost think
they'd want to forget
about it for the weekend.

50
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:56,795
Well, then it's a good thing
you're not regional manager

51
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,548
and I am.

52
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,555
For Christ's sake,
I got to get
the hell out of here.

53
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:08,181
Jesus!

54
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,227
God damn it, Homer!
Christ, I gotta
get to work!

55
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,980
Don't need this
bullshit in the morning!

56
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:17,190
Just leave them.
I'll get them,
thank you.

57
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,860
For Christ's sakes.

58
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:25,866
And I want you
out of here by 5:00.
No, 3:00.

59
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,826
Get out of here
by 3:00 today.

60
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,500
Good morning.

61
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,336
Morning,
<i>is Louise there?</i>

62
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,795
Why, yes, she is.

63
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,090
Is this Thelma?
Thelma, when are you
gonna run away with me?

64
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,925
Not this weekend, sweetie,
she's running away with me.

65
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,218
Hey, what'd he say?

66
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,803
What time are you
picking me up?

67
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:49,765
<i>All right! I'll be there</i>
<i>around 2:00 or 3:00.</i>

68
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:53,101
Okay. Say, what kind
of stuff do I bring?

69
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,520
I don't know.
Warm stuff, I guess.

70
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:57,439
It's the mountains.
I guess it gets
cold at night.

71
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:58,899
I don't know.
I'm just gonna
bring everything.

72
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,443
Okay, I will,
too, then.

73
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,528
<i>And steal</i>
<i>Darryl's fishing stuff.</i>

74
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,405
Louise, I don't
know how to fish.

75
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,200
Neither do I, Thelma,
but Darryl does it.
How hard can it be?

76
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,369
All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

77
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,454
Okay. All right, bye.

78
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,313
<i>As you brush your shoes</i>

79
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:42,901
<i>And stand before the mirror</i>

80
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,320
<i>And you comb your hair</i>

81
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,783
<i>And grab your coat and out</i>

82
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,035
<i>And you walk the wet streets</i>

83
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,163
<i>Trying to remember</i>

84
00:06:56,666 --> 00:07:02,045
<i>All the wild night breezes</i>
<i>in your memory ever</i>

85
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,341
<i>And everything</i>
<i>looks so complete</i>

86
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,428
<i>When you're walkin'</i>
<i>out on the street</i>

87
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:13,348
Hey,
<i>this is Jimmy.</i>
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

88
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,227
<i>And sends you flyin', cryin'</i>

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:23,191
Ooh-wee

90
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:29,531
<i>The wild night is callin'</i>

91
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,541
<i>And all the girls walk by</i>

92
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,710
Hey.
Hey.

93
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,299
No, Thelma,
we don't need the lantern.
The place has electricity.

94
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,759
Okay. No, I want
to take it anyway,
just in case.

95
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:51,052
In case of what?

96
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:54,347
In case there's some
escaped psycho killer
on the loose

97
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,475
who cuts
the electricity off

98
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:58,393
and tries to
come in and kill us.

99
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,022
Sure, Thelma.
Well, then that lantern'll
come in real handy.

100
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:05,108
Maybe we should
just tow your car
behind, too,

101
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,152
in case he steals
the spark plugs.

102
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,571
We'd have to.
That thing barely makes it
down the driveway.

103
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,466
Careful. Careful.

104
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,260
All right,
everything in?
Yeah.

105
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:33,762
Careful.

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,764
Here you go.
Be careful.
All right.

107
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,434
Smile.

108
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,567
Sit down!

109
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,112
Oh, Louise?
Uh-huh.

110
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,697
Will you take care
of this gun?

111
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,449
What in hell did
you bring that for?

112
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,619
Come on.
Psycho killers or
bears or snakes.

113
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:59,871
I just don't know
how to use it.
Will you take care of it?

114
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,624
Put it away. Just...
Here, put it in my purse.

115
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:05,210
Thelma, good Lord.

116
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:12,342
So, whose place
is this again?

117
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,095
It's Bob's,
the day manager's.

118
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,180
He's getting a divorce,
so his wife's getting
this place.

119
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,932
So he's letting all
his friends use it

120
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,850
till he's got to
turn over the keys.

121
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,314
I've never been out
of town without Darryl.

122
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,401
How come
Darryl let you go?

123
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,111
'Cause I didn't ask him.

124
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,821
Shit, Thelma!

125
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,116
He's gonna kill you!

126
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,285
Well, he'd never
let me go.

127
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,038
He never lets me do
one goddamn thing
that's any fun.

128
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,125
All he wants me to do
is hang around the house
the whole time

129
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,460
while he's out doing
God only knows what.

130
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,838
Well, you get
what you settle for.

131
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,257
I left him a note.

132
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,844
I left him stuff
to microwave.

133
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,432
<i>Children laugh,</i>
<i>children cry</i>

134
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,184
<i>They're the ones</i>
<i>who will survive</i>

135
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:06,187
<i>Will they know</i>
<i>what we've sold?</i>

136
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,149
<i>Nature's gift</i>
<i>we turn for gold</i>

137
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:12,277
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>what I see now</i>

138
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,113
<i>In my life,</i>
<i>what I see now</i>

139
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,949
<i>I don't like</i>
<i>where we're goin'</i>

140
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,744
<i>I don't like it, no</i>

141
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:22,495
Thelma.
What?

142
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,375
<i>You and I,</i>
<i>we're getting older now</i>

143
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,628
<i>You and I

144
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,548
<i>Who will show them</i>
<i>if we don't show them how?</i>

145
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,303
<i>I wanna know, is it true?</i>

146
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:44,059
<i>Is there a house of hope</i>
<i>for me and you?</i>

147
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,269
Thelma,
what are you doing?

148
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,562
Smoking.

149
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:52,275
Hey, I'm Louise.

150
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,945
<i>House of hope</i>
<i>for me and you</i>

151
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,701
I'll never make it.
Can't we just stop
somewhere for a minute?

152
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,913
Thelma, we're not gonna
get to the cabin until
after dark as it is.

153
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,374
Then what difference
would it make
if we stopped?

154
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,168
Come on,
I never get to do
stuff like this.

155
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,504
Okay. But it's gonna
be a quick stop.

156
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:13,588
Fine, okay.

157
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,705
<i>I'm still waiting here,</i>
<i>and it's half past two</i>

158
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:52,001
<i>And I don't wanna</i>
<i>love you, but I do</i>

159
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,421
I haven't seen
a place like this
since I left Texas.

160
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,047
Isn't this fun?

161
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,677
<i>That place with</i>
<i>a little dance floor</i>

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,517
<i>Said you'd never</i>
<i>been in there before</i>

163
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,937
Y'all want a drink?

164
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,063
No, thanks.

165
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,108
I'll have a Wild Turkey
straight up and
a Coke back, please.

166
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,568
Thelma?

167
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,902
Oh, what?
Tell me something.

168
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,779
Is this my vacation
or isn't it?

169
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,323
I mean, God,
you're as bad as Darryl.

170
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,410
I'm sorry, it's just
I'm just not used to
seeing you this way.

171
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,872
I... I haven't seen you
this way in a while.
You're usually so sedate.

172
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,750
Well, I've had it
up to my ass with sedate.

173
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,502
You said you and me
is gonna get out of town,

174
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:36,963
and for once,
just really let
our hair down.

175
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:40,258
Well, darling, look out,
'cause my hair
is coming down.

176
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,635
All right.
I've changed my mind.

177
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,599
I'm gonna have a margarita
and a shot of Cuervo
on the side.

178
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,268
All right!
Get me another one.

179
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:53,062
<i>I don't want to</i>
<i>love you, but I do</i>

180
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,355
Hey.

181
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:58,568
Now, what are a couple
of Kewpie dolls like you
doing in a place like this?

182
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:00,445
We left town
for the weekend...
Minding our own business.

183
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,488
Why don't you try?

184
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,031
...'cause we wanted to
try and have some fun.

185
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,284
And 'cause Louise here
is mad at her boyfriend
'cause...

186
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:09,329
We just wanted to
get something to eat.

187
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,997
Well, you come
to the right place.

188
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,625
Do you like chili?
They got good chili.

189
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,378
Harlan, you bothering
these poor girls?

190
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,297
Hell, no, I was
just being friendly.

191
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,050
It's a good thing
they're not all
as friendly as you.

192
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,638
Hey, your name's
Harlan? I got
an uncle named Harlan.

193
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:27,972
You do?
Uh-huh.

194
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,432
Is he a funny uncle?

195
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:32,393
'Cause if he is,
then he and I got
something in common.

196
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,983
I don't mean
to be rude,

197
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,153
but I got something
I got to talk to my friend
about in private.

198
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,031
I... I understand.
I didn't mean
to bother you.

199
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,868
It's just hard not to
notice two such pretty
ladies as yourselves.

200
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,708
You better dance with me
before you leave,
or I will never forgive you.

201
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,752
Sure, that'd be fun.

202
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,758
Jeez, Louise,
that wasn't very nice.

203
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,052
Can't you tell
when somebody's
hitting on you?

204
00:14:06,136 --> 00:14:07,846
So what if he was?

205
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,057
It's all your years of
waiting tables has made
you jaded, that's all.

206
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,393
Maybe.

207
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,563
Well, just relax, will you?
You're making me nervous.

208
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,772
All right!

209
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,041
<i>I woke up in a hotel</i>
<i>I didn't know what to do</i>

210
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,127
<i>I turned the TV on</i>
<i>and wrote a letter to you</i>

211
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:40,545
That's a good band.

212
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,715
<i>The news was talking</i>
<i>about a dragnet</i>
<i>up on the interstate</i>

213
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,219
<i>Seems they were looking</i>
<i>for a Cadillac</i>
<i>with Tennessee plates</i>

214
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,637
Wonder if Darryl's home yet.

215
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,055
Wonder if Jimmy's
got back.

216
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,058
Why don't you just
tell him to get lost
once and for all?

217
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,477
Why don't you ditch that
no-good husband of yours?

218
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,771
Huh? Huh?

219
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,648
This one's on Harlan.

220
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:03,818
Thanks.

221
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:09,908
Well, look, Jimmy'll
come in off the road
and you won't be there.

222
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,994
He'll freak out
and call you
100,000 times.

223
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:14,537
Sunday night,
you'll call him back,

224
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,915
and by Monday,
he'll be kissing
the ground you walk on.

225
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,249
Exactly.

226
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:20,585
In the meantime,
you said we was
gonna have some fun,

227
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,337
so let's have some!

228
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,589
All right.
Okay.

229
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,180
<i>If they knew</i>
<i>what we were up to,</i>
<i>they wouldn't let us in</i>

230
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:34,974
<i>Landed in Memphis</i>
<i>like original sin</i>

231
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,687
<i>Up Elvis Presley Boulevard</i>

232
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,774
<i>Yeah, see, we were</i>

233
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,734
Let's dance.
All right!

234

00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:03,044
Thelma.
That's your name? Thelma?
That's a lovely name.

238
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,088
I don't know
what I'm doing.

239
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,464
Just follow me, Thelma.

240
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,548
I don't know what...

241
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,427
Ma'am, you wanna
dance a little?
Sure.

242
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:15,264
<i>Since I left California, baby</i>
<i>Things have gotten worse</i>

243
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:18,476

244
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,896

248
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,284
You got some
great moves, honey.

249

<i>I was never king of nothing</i>

250
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,164

251
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,294
All right! Here we go!
Here we go! Here we go!

252
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,657
Hey, hey, Thelma!
Oh, Louise.

253
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,827
I'm hitting the little
girls' room and then
we're out of here.

254
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,663
I'm ready
when you are.

255
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,335
Wait, Louise,
I want to come
with you.

256
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,796
Turn around.

257
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:14,342
I don't feel so good.
What's wrong? Come on.

258
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:18,096
Shit. Stop!
What's wrong?

259
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,390
I'm spinning.

260
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,769
Oopsy-doopsy.

261
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,396
We need to get you
some fresh air,
little lady.

262
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,856
Uh-huh.

263
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,465
Look, have you
seen my friend?

264
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,675
Your friend?

265
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,554
Uh... Yeah. Yeah.
She was out there
dancing. Dancing.

266
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,684
How you
feeling now, darling?

267
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,561
Oh. Thanks.

268
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:09,730
I think I'm starting
to feel a little better.

269
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:13,693
You're starting to feel
pretty good to me, too.
You know that?

270
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,154
I think I need
to keep walking.

271
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,573
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

272
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,158
Where do you think
you're going, huh?

273
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:21,409
I'm going back inside.

274
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:22,577
Oh, no, no.

275
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,203
Harlan.

276
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,329
What?

277
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,248
Hey, quit it.
Stop it. Stop it.

278
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,584
Thelma, Thelma,
listen to me.
Listen to me.

279
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,087
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I just wanna kiss you.

280
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,755
All right?
No. No.

281
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,924
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.

282
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,846
Goddamn, you are gorgeous.

283
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,014
All right, let me
go now. Come on.

284
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:45,057
Let me go!
I mean, I'm married!

285
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,143
Come on.
That's okay,
I'm married, too.

286
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:49,312
I don't feel good.
I've been sick.

287
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:50,563
<i>Aw.</i>

288
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:54,483
Listen to me,
I said I'm not gonna
hurt you. All right?

289
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,653
Relax.
Harlan, stop it,
please! I mean it!

290
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:01,782
Wait, don't! I mean it!
Louise is gonna wonder
where I am!

291
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,826
Fuck Louise! Fuck...

292
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,994
Hey!

293
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,749
Don't ever
fucking hit me!
Fucking bitch!

294
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:13,669
Harlan, please!
Harlan, please!
Do you hear me?

295
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:16,214
Don't hurt me,
Harlan, please!
Shut up!

296
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,049
Shut the fuck up!
You hear me?

297
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,842
Shut up!
Please.

298
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:21,719
Please don't
hurt me, Harlan!

299
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,012
Goddamn bitch!

300
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,513
Don't hurt me, Harlan!

301
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,808
Let her go!
Louise!

302
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,352
Get the fuck
out of here.

303
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,314
Louise!

304
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,733
You let her go,
you fucking asshole,

305
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,778
or I'm gonna
splatter your ugly face
all over this nice car.

306
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,250
All right, hey, hey,
hey, just calm down.

307
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,543
We were just having
a little fun, that's all.

308
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,672
Looks like you got
a real fucked-up
idea of fun.

309
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,509
Come on.
Come on.

310
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,682
Turn around.

311
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,063
In the future,

312
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,024
when a woman's
crying like that,

313
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,860
she isn't having any fun!

314
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:29,078
Bitch!
I should've gone ahead
and fucked her!

315
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,457
What did you say?

316
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,543
I said,
"Suck my cock."

317
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:44,343
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

318
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,554
Get the car.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

319
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,431
Louise, you shot him.

320
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,725
Oh, my God.
Get the car.

321
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,403
You watch your mouth, buddy.

322
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,619
Louise, come on!

323
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:28,304
Watch it,
you fucking asshole!

324
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:42,860
Louise?

325
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,911
Louise, where
are we going?

326
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,373
I don't know. I don't know.
Just shut up so I can think.

327
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,293
Shouldn't we go
to the cops?

328
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,129
I mean, I think
we ought to tell
the police.

329
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:03,255
Tell them what, Thelma?

330
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,299
Just what do you think
we should tell them, huh?

331
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,676
I don't know.
Just tell them
what happened.

332
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,095
Which part?

333
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,848
All of it. That... That...
That he was raping me.

334
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:15,142
Jeez, about a hundred
goddamn people
saw you dancing

335
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,727
cheek to cheek
with him all night!

336
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:17,895
Who's gonna believe that?

337
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:20,147
We don't live in
that kind of a world,
Thelma.

338
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,982
God damn it, pull over!

339
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,857
All right.

340
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,905
Thelma?

341
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,992
Thelma.

342
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,577
Huh?

343
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,624
Thelma, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna...

344
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:25,671
I'm gonna stop someplace
for a cup of coffee
and then...

345
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:29,383
Just for a second,
and then I'm gonna
get it together.

346
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,553
And we'll figure out
then what to do.

347
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,515
And everything's gonna
be fine, all right?

348
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,976
Everything's gonna be...
All right?

349
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Uh-huh.

350
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,332
Now is not
the time to panic.

351
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,125
If we panic now,
we're done for.

352
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:08,547
Nobody saw it.
Nobody knows it was us.

353
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:09,840
Okay.

354
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,467
So we're still okay.

355
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:16,347
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do next.

356
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:20,226
We just have to figure out
what we're gonna do.

357
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:27,399
I'll say one thing.
This is some vacation.

358
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,445
I sure am
having a good time.
This is real fun.

359
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,659
If you weren't concerned
with having so much fun,
we wouldn't be here right now.

360
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,161
Just what is that
supposed to mean?

361
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,704
It just means
shut up, Thelma.

362
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,333
So this is all
my fault, is it?

363
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,676
<i>I don't wanna play house</i>

364
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:59,473
<i>I know it can't be fun</i>

365
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,400
I have to go
to the bathroom.

366
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,780
Sorry.

367
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,202
Can I get you
anything else?

368
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,620
Just the check, please.

369
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,803
Thanks,
I'll try again later.

370
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,182
Move back,
people.

371
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,852
Stand away from
the line, please.

372
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,981
No, it's secured
until further notice.

373
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,070
Could you identify them
if you saw them again?

374
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,614
Hell, I told you 50 times.

375
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,074
Yeah, I could identify them,
but neither one of those two

376
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,243
was the type to pull
something like this.

377
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:05,247
Well, you're not
exactly an expert witness,
but what makes you so sure?

378
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:08,917
If waiting tables in a bar
don't make you an expert
on human nature,

379
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,085
nothing will.

380
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,921
I could've told you
Harlan Puckett was
gonna end up

381
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,506
buying it in
a parking lot.

382
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,426
I'm just surprised
it didn't happen
sooner than this.

383
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,594
Who do you think did it?

384
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,137
Has anybody
asked his wife?

385
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,847
She's the one
I hope did it.

386
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,309
Lena, do you have
any ideas or don't you?

387
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:29,980
Well, if I had to guess,
I'd say it was some old gal,
some old gal's husband.

388
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,733
But it wasn't neither
one of those two.

389
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,402
The smaller one,
the one with
the tidy hairdo,

390
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,988
she left me
a huge tip.

391
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:40,407
Well.
What?

392
00:27:40,784 --> 00:27:44,411
You didn't happen
to notice what kind of car
they were driving, did you?

393
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,915
It's a nightclub, Hal,
not a drive-in.

394
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:51,377
I don't follow
the customers out
to the parking lot.

395
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,337
All right.
Lena, go on home.

396
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,382
Oh! You kept me here
all night to ask me

397
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:58,550
the same old question
over and over again.

398
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:03,764
Ain't you gonna offer me
some teeny-weeny,
witty-bitty little drink?

399
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,475
Behave yourself.
Oh!

400
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,355
Neither of those two
was the murdering type, Hal.

401
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,074
<i>Hi, this is Jimmy.</i>

402
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,252
Thelma, you in there?

403
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,628
Uh-huh.

404
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:47,391
Thelma, come on,
we're out of here!
Thelma, come on.

405
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,318
We're gonna need money.

406
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,904
Thelma, how much money
you have on you?

407
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,990
What?

408
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,578
I'm gonna stop
at the next town.
We'll get a motel room.

409
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,414
I can rest for a little bit
and then I'll figure out
what to do.

410
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:11,707
Okay.

411
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,001
Wait, I'm looking.

412
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,131
$61.

413
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:21,842
Shit.

414
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,387
$41.

415
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,099
We're gonna need
more money.

416
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,394
What are you doing?
Why are you unpacking?

417
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,148
You said we was just
gonna take a nap.

418
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,150
I'm trying
to figure out
what to do.

419
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,116
When you figure it out,
just wake me up.

420
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,913
What the hell's
wrong with you?

421
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,457
What's that
supposed to mean?

422
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,958
I mean, why are you
acting like this?

423
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,086
Acting like what?
How am I supposed
to act?

424
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,299
Excuse me for not knowing
how to act when you blow
somebody away!

425
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,510
You could help me
try to figure out
what to do, all right?

426
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:07,179
I'm trying to
figure out what to do.
But you could try...

427
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,933
I did! I had a suggestion
that we go to the police,

428
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,644
but you didn't like that,
so frankly, Louise,
I'm out of ideas.

429
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,145
What's the big rush,
Thelma?

430
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,856
I mean, if we
give them enough time,
they'll come to us.

431
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,789
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,416
I'm just not ready
to go to jail yet, okay?

433
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,214
Why don't you... Um...

434
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,135
Why don't you go out
to the pool and take a swim
or something, all right?

435
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,680
Now, I'll figure out
what to do.

436
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,893
Jimmy, this is Louise.
Look, I've been
trying to call you.

437
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,229
Louise?
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

438
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,772
Hi.

439
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,276
<i>Where the hell are you at?</i>
<i>Are you all right?</i>

440
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:06,280
Yeah, I'm fine.
How are you?
Long time no see.

441
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,448
<i>You sound kind</i>
<i>of funny, Louise.</i>

442
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,617
I am funny.
Real funny.

443
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,370
<i>Are you in town?</i>
<i>It sounds long-distance.</i>

444
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,540
No, I'm out of town.
I'm in...

445
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,128
I'm in deep shit, Jimmy.
Deep Shit, Arkansas.

446
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:26,383
Louise,
now you just tell me what
the hell's going on here.

447
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,636
I come back,
nobody knows
where you are.

448
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,514
Is Thelma with you?

449
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,682
<i>Listen, Jimmy.</i>

450
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:37,269
I have about $6,700
in the bank.

451
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:42,816
Now, I know
you can't get it out,
but I need that money.

452
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:47,738
Can you wire me the $6,700
and I'll pay you back?

453
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:50,032
What the fuck is going
on here, Louise?

454
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,159
Listen,

455
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,163
something real bad
has happened.

456
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,626
And I can't
tell you what.

457
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:06,965
Just that I did it
and I can't undo it.

458
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,304
<i>Will you help me, please?</i>

459
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,349
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
baby, of course I can.

460
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,976
<i>Where? Why can't</i>
<i>I bring it to you?</i>

461
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,153
Jimmy.

462
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,742
Do you love me?

463
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,499
<i>Yeah.</i>

464
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,001
Never mind.
Never mind.
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

465
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,336
Look, just...

466
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:50,008
Just wire it to Western Union
in Oklahoma City, okay?

467
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,094
<i>So that's</i>
<i>where you're at,</i>
<i>Oklahoma, huh?</i>

468
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,345
Not yet.

469
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,473
You call me back
and I'll tell you
which office to go to.

470
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,141
All right. All right.

471
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,310
I'll call you back
in an hour.

472
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,565
Thelma!

473
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:11,655
<i>I can feel it when I hear</i>
<i>that lonesome highway</i>

474
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:14,825
Thelma!

475
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,244
<i>So many miles to go</i>
<i>before I die</i>

476
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,704
Thelma!

477
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,080
What?
Get in the car!

478
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,248
Okay.

479
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:26,211
<i>We can never know</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

480
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,427
<i>But still we have to choose</i>
<i>which way to go</i>

481
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:41,101
<i>You and I are standing</i>
<i>at the crossroads</i>

482
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,980
Even if they didn't do it,
it turns out they most
likely witnessed it,

483
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:46,690
so somebody
better talk
to them.

484
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,277
Put out an APB and
see what we get back.
All right.

485
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,780
Any reason to believe
they've left the state?

486
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,576
That's certainly possible.

487
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,787
<i>Hal, why don't</i>
<i>we go ahead and let</i>
<i>the Bureau in on this?</i>

488
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:16,219
Louise, don't get mad, okay?
But where are we going?

489
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,763
Oklahoma City.

490
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,474
Jimmy's gonna
wire me some money
and then we're gonna...

491
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,142
Jimmy? Did you
talk to him?

492
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,478
Did you tell him?
What did he say?
Is he mad?

493
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,563
No, I didn't tell him,
and that's what we
gotta get straight now.

494
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,067
Darryl's been calling,
mad as a hornet,
making all kinds of noise.

495
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,322
When you call him,
you gotta not tell him
anything about this.

496
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,824
You gotta just make sure
everything sounds
real normal.

497
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,078
You know,
I called the asshole
at 4:00 in the morning.

498
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,579
He wasn't even home.

499
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:45,749
I don't know what
he's got to be mad about.

500
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,626
I'm the one that
should be mad.

501
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:51,254
Thelma.

502
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,549
I'm going to Mexico.

503
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,968
Now, I figure I can make it
in two and a half days,

504
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,845
but I'm gonna
have to haul ass.

505
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:04,351
Are you up to this?
I mean, I gotta know.
This isn't a game.

506
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:08,271
I'm in deep shit
and I gotta know
what you're gonna do.

507
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,152
I don't know.
I don't know, Louise.

508
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,113
I mean, I don't know
what you're asking.

509
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,406
Now, don't you...
Don't you start
flaking out on me!

510
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,826
God damn it, Thelma,
every time that
we get in trouble,

511
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:25,580
you just get blank or...
Or plead insanity
or some such shit.

512
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:29,126
Not this time.
I mean, this time
things have changed.

513
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,836
Everything's changed.

514
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,550
But I'm going to Mexico.

515
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:38,885
I'm going.

516
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,844
Louise?
<i>Is that the way</i>
<i>you answer the phone?</i>

517
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,597
I was afraid
I'd missed you.

518
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,144
I... I... I got it.
I was afraid I couldn't get
a check cashed on Saturday.

519
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:30,520
Who did it?

520
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,148
<i>A friend of mine</i>
<i>who owns a club.</i>
<i>Doug Randall.</i>

521
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,941
You didn't tell him
what it's for, did you?

522
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,986
No, I didn't say what
it was for. I told him
I was buying a car.

523
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:41,281
Good. That's real good.
Listen, where do I go?

524
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,450
It's a place called
the Vagabond Motel.

525
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,996
It's at
1921 North East 23rd.

526
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,790
It's under "Peaches."

527
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,250
What?

528
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:59,299
That's the code word.
I miss you, Peaches.

529
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,844
Thanks, Jimmy.
I appreciate it.

530
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,944
Ma'am, you sure
you wouldn't rather have
a large economy size?

531
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,906
No, no, that's okay.

532
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,660
What are you looking at?

533
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,245
Hey.
Hey.

534
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,913
I want you to call Darryl.

535
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,790
Call him?
Mmm-hmm.

536
00:37:31,874 --> 00:37:35,293
Tell him you're having
a wonderful time and
you'll be home tomorrow night.

537
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:36,378
Will I be?

538
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,380
I don't know.

539
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,298
I won't.

540
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,385
Ah! The newspaper.

541
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,651
This is Darryl.

542
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:02,529
I have
<i>a collect call from Thelma.</i>
<i>Will you accept?</i>

543
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,948
Why, yes,
I will, operator.

544
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,744
Thelma, where in
the Sam Hill are you?

545
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,914
Um, I'm with Louise.

546
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,959
We're...
We're in the mountains,
we're fishing.

547
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,628
Have you lost
your mind?
Is that it?

548
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:22,090
Now I leave for work,
and you take complete
leave of your senses?

549
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,676
Darryl,
calm down, please.

550
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,679
Don't get so mad.
I can explain, okay?

551
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,556
See, Louise...

552
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,391
Hold on! Hold on!

553
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,686
Come on, Kurt, kick it.

554
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,813
Kurt
<i>knocks the ball loose.</i>
Kick it.

555
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,274
Shit! God!
<i>Kurt's got it.</i>
<i>He ends up with the ball.</i>

556
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,652
Christ.

557
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:44,321
We're just gonna stay
there and, you know,

558
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,156
fish and hang out and stuff.

559
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,782
We'll just be gone
one more day

560
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:48,908
and then we'll be
home tomorrow night.

561
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:51,202
No, you won't.
You'll be back today.

562
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,622
You get your butt
back here, Thelma, now.

563
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:56,166
God damn it!

564
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:58,501
Darryl.

565
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,422
Darryl?

566
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,091
You're my husband,
not my father.

567
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,593
Oh! Now, that does it.

568
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,262
That Louise is nothing
but a bad influence!

569
00:39:10,306 --> 00:39:12,390
If you're not
back here by tonight,

570
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,936
Thelma,

571
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:21,191
well, then I just
don't wanna say.

572
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,402
Darryl.

573
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,279
Thelma.

574
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,823
Go fuck yourself.

575
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,871
Oh, that's good,
that's just sweet.

576
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,877
Shit!
Sorry.

577
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,879
Darling, you all right?
Are you okay?

578
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,798
Did I cause that?
No, I'm sorry.

579
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,549
No? You're okay?
Uh-huh.

580
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,219
All right.
Is there something
I can do for you?

581
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,637
No, it's okay.
Hmm?

582
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,977
Crazy.

583
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,272
Excuse me, ma'am.

584
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,607
Uh... May I ask which
direction you're heading?

585
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,694
See, I'm trying
to get back to school.
My ride fell through.

586
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,280
Well, I'm kind of
stuck here like
stink on stink.

587
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,032
So I was thinking
that if you're going my way

588
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,285
or if I'm going
your way...

589
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,704
I think we're going
to Oklahoma City,

590
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,330
but I'm not sure.
Perfect.

591
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:02,000
Yeah. Well,
I'd appreciate it much.

592
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:03,751
Mmm.

593
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,963
Well, see,
it's really not up to me.
It's not my car.

594
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,465
Um...

595
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,050
We'd have to ask my friend.

596
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:14,596
But she'd probably say no.
She's a little bit uptight.

597
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,639
Maybe it's not
such a good idea.

598
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,142
But I'll tell you what,
I thank you for your time.

599
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,144
But, you know,
I mean, I can ask,
you know.

600
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,228
It wouldn't hurt nothing.

601
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,689
Well, no,
it wouldn't hurt.

602
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:26,566
Hey.

603
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,569
Louise. Hey, Louise.

604
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:32,697
This young man here's
on his way back to school

605
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,617
and I thought
since we're going in
the same direction,

606
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,785
you know, we could
give him a ride, huh?

607
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:43,208
It's probably
not a good idea.

608
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:45,502
Louise...

609
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,795
No, probably not,
but I appreciate your time.

610
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,423
You all have a good day,
all right? Drive safe.

611
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,716
Louise?

612
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,475
Did you see
how polite he is?
He was real sweet.

613
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:01,935
Thelma.
What?

614
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,605
Take care of
yourself, now.

615
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,535
Fill her up.

616
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,538
Sure wish we could have
brought him with us.

617
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,290
What did Darryl
have to say?

618
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:29,170
He said, "Okay, Thelma,
I just wanted to make
sure you was all right.

619
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:31,381
"I sure hope
you're having fun.

620
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,716
"You deserve it.
After all,
you put up with me.

621
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,301
"I love you, honey."

622
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:45,103
So, how long before
we're in goddamn Mexico?

623
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,168
I just didn't
think it would hurt to
give somebody a ride.

624
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,546
Did you see his butt?

625
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,257
Darryl don't have
a cute butt.

626
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,385
You could park a car
in the shadow of his ass.

627
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,972
I'm sorry.
I'm just not in the mood
for company right now.

628
00:43:24,852 --> 00:43:28,104
Here, take this map.
I need you to find
all the secondary roads

629
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:30,481
to Mexico from
Oklahoma City.

630
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,234
I think we should
stay off the interstate.
We're too conspicuous.

631
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,615
Looks like we could get
on this Road 81 here

632
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,575
and head down towards Dallas.

633
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,243
No, I don't want
to go through Texas.

634
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,370
Find some way
we don't have to
go through there.

635
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,540
Wait.

636
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:52,545
What? You want
to go to Mexico
from Oklahoma,

637
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,422
but you don't wanna
go through Texas?

638
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:58,551
Thelma, you know
how I feel about Texas!
We're not going that way!

639
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:01,971
Yeah, I know, Louise,
but we're running
for our lives.

640
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,765
I mean, can't you
make an exception?

641
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,475
I mean, look at this map!

642
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,728
The only thing between
Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas.

643
00:44:08,812 --> 00:44:09,854
Look!

644
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,689
Thelma, I'm not
gonna talk about this!

645
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,984
Now, you either find
another way or give me
the goddamn map and I will!

646
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,444
Do you understand?

647
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:17,904
No, Louise, I don't.

648
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,824
Now, how come
you never told me what
happened to you there?

649
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,583
Look, you shoot off
a guy's head
with his pants down,

650
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,461
believe me,
Texas is not the place
you wanna get caught.

651
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:35,380
Now, trust me.

652
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,174
Now, I've told you,
I'm not gonna talk
about this anymore.

653
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,131
Happy birthday, lady.

654
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:23,094
<i>You know, you could</i>
<i>have been a cuckoo</i>

655
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:26,222
<i>And, baby, you're so smart</i>

656
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,059
<i>You know you could</i>
<i>have been a schoolbook</i>

657
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:35,648
<i>Well, you could have been</i>
<i>anything that you wanted to</i>

658
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,568
<i>And I can tell</i>

659
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:44,615
<i>The way you do</i>
<i>the things you do</i>

660
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,384
Is the manager in?

661
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,596
Marian, there's
a police officer here.

662
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,412
All right. All right,
Thelma. All right.

663
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,040
Okay.

664
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:08,574
The other night
there was a murder out
at the Silver Bullet.

665
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:10,743
A man was shot.

666
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,996
And we have some
witnesses that saw

667
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,125
a 1966 T-Bird convertible
leaving the scene,

668
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,254
sort of speeding out
of the driveway there.

669
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:24,924
And that vehicle
is registered
to one Louise Sawyer.

670
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:28,886
And we have
reason to believe
that your wife was

671
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,848
the other occupant
of that car.

672
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:41,107
What?

673
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,067
Excuse me.

674
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:45,444
You're standing
in your pizza.

675
00:47:46,238 --> 00:47:47,363
Shit!

676
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,701
So, tell me something,
Ms. Thelma. How is it
you ain't got any kids?

677
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,160
I mean, God gives you
something special,

678
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,954
I think you ought
to pass it on.

679
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:59,333
Well, Darryl,
that's my husband...
Darryl?

680
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,544
Yeah. He says
he's not ready yet.

681
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:04,046
He says he's still
too much of a kid himself.

682
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,507
Kind of prides himself
on being infantile.

683
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,050
He's got a lot
to be proud of.

684
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:09,552
Louise and him
don't get along.

685
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,137
That's
putting it mildly.

686
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,221
She thinks he's a pig.

687
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,806
I know he's a pig.

688
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:17,310
Did you get married
real young, Ms. Thelma?

689
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,104
Well, I guess
18's kind of young.

690
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:26,152
But we'd already been
going out four years
when we got married.

691
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:28,654
Out for how long?
Four years.

692
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,782
I never been with
anybody but Darryl.

693
00:48:32,492 --> 00:48:33,743
Oh, I'm sorry.

694
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,954
Well, if you don't
mind me saying so,

695
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,831
he sounds like
a real asshole.

696
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,001
It's okay.

697
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:45,838
He is an asshole.
Most of the time,
I just let it slide.

698
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:51,677
You better slow down
there, Ms. Louise.
That's a cop up ahead.

699
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:53,679
Shit.

700
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:32,301
Maybe you got a few
too many parking tickets.

701
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,095
We'll take you
to Oklahoma City,

702
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:35,805
then you best be
on your way, all right?

703
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,223
All right.

704
00:49:44,606 --> 00:49:48,067
Prints on the trunk
of the car match those
of Thelma Dickinson.

705
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,569
I'll be damned.
Isn't that strange?

706
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,863
And the husband says
a gun is missing.

707
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,366
She took a lot of stuff.

708
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,412
It looks like
she may be planning on
being gone a while.

709
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,122
The strange thing is

710
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:04,750
her husband said
she would never
touch that gun.

711
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,546
He got it for her
'cause he's out late a lot,

712
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,883
but he said
she'd never touch it,
wouldn't learn to shoot it.

713
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,677
Just kept it in
a drawer for years.

714
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,053
What kind of gun was it?

715
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,263
.38.

716
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,015
Right. Where are they?

717
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:22,810
They were on their way
to some guy's cabin
and they never showed up.

718
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,691
All right. Now,
I'm gonna go and...

719
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,193
Listen up, you two.
I'm gonna go in. It's
just gonna take a minute.

720
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:34,071
You two better
say your goodbyes,
you understand?

721
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,448
Okay.

722
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:41,871
Hi.
Hi.

723
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:44,623
I'm here to pick up
a money order
for Louise Sawyer.

724
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:49,336
There's nothing.

725
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:53,799
How about "Peaches"?
Could you try
code word "Peaches"?

726
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:56,635
Did I hear somebody
say "Peaches"?

727
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,637
Oh, my God. Jimmy.

728
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:00,681
That's the secret word.

729
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,517
Show the lady
what she's won, Don.

730
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,480
What are you doing here?

731
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,565
I just came
to see you, baby.

732
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,444
Can I have
another room, please?

733
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:15,488
Put it on
my credit card.

734
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,041
Thelma? Thelma,
get your foot down.

735
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,751
Thelma, look who's here.

736
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,254
Oh! Shit! Jimmy.
Hi, stranger.

737
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,256
What in the world
are you doing here?

738
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,176
Ask me no questions
and I'll tell you no lies.

739
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:40,179
Good answer.
Same goes
double for me.

740
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:42,098
Who's the cowboy?

741
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,350
This here...
This is J. D.
How'd do?

742
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,143
He's a student.
He's gone.

743
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:49,230
We're just giving him
a ride to here, then he...

744
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:51,774
Louise said that
he would have to go, so...
He's gone.

745
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,192
I guess that's
what he's doing.

746
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,693
Yeah, I reckon
that's what I'm doing.

747
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:56,153
He's gone.
Like the wind.

748
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,239
Have a good trip.
Thank you.

749
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,782
Nice meeting you.

750
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,660
Yep.

751
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,122
Yep, that's him going.
I love watching him go.

752
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,957
Thelma kind of
took to him.

753
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,793
Yeah, well,
I got you a room there,
Thelma.

754
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,379
You can go on in
and take yourself
a nice cold shower.

755
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,382
Well,
you know me, Jimmy,
I'm just a wild woman.

756
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:30,813
It's our future.

757
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,324
What are you
gonna tell him?

758
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,743
Nothing.

759
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,538
I'm not gonna
tell him a thing.

760
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:50,499
The least I can do
is not make him
any more of an accessory

761
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,959
than he already is.

762
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,296
You are so sweet to that guy.
You know, you really are.

763
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,673
Imagine not wanting
to drag him into this.

764
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,425
I didn't ask him to come.

765
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,552
It's like I said,
he's no different
than any other guy.

766
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:02,761
He just loves
the chase is all.

767
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:07,224
Well, he sure got
his work cut out
for him now, don't he?

768
00:53:07,309 --> 00:53:08,976
Thelma, just
put a lid on it!

769
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:13,022
Now...

770
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:17,193
I want you to just...
You guard that money.

771
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,153
Okay.

772
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:23,490
And if there's any problem,
then you call me in Room 211.

773
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:25,993
Okay.

774
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,495
I won't wait up.

775
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,474
You want a drink?
No.

776
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,645
Why don't you tell me
what's going on?

777
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:57,066
I'm not gonna tell you
what's going on.

778
00:53:57,150 --> 00:53:59,068
Someday soon
you'll understand
why I can't,

779
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,861
but I'm not going to,
so don't ask me.

780
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:07,701
Can I ask you
one thing?
Maybe.

781
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,162
Are you in love
with somebody else?

782
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:13,666
Does this
have something to do
with another man?

783
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,168
No, it's not
anything like that.

784
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:21,048
Then what is it,
God damn it?

785
00:54:22,008 --> 00:54:24,218
Are you just gonna leave
for fucking ever?

786
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,805
What, did you fucking
kill somebody?

787
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,515
You start this shit,
I'm out of here!

788
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:35,854
I'm sorry.

789
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:40,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

790
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,612
You wanna come
back over there
and sit down?

791
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:45,489
I wanna give you something.

792
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:46,949
I'm fine right here.

793
00:54:47,033 --> 00:54:48,117
I wanna
give you something.

794
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,702
Give it to me here.

795
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:55,874
Here.

796
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,138
Why don't you try it on?

797
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:14,727
You didn't see
that one coming,
did you?

798
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:17,229
Why, Jimmy?

799
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,191
Why now?

800
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,612
Try not to get
too excited, Louise.

801
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:30,284
I just flew across
two states with that ring
in my fucking hand and...

802
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,621
You know I hate to fly.

803
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,045
You came all this way
because you thought
I was with somebody else.

804
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:46,008
No, that's not
why I came.

805
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:52,723
Because, you know, I...
I don't want to lose you.

806
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,227
And I get the feeling
like you're gonna,
like, split permanently.

807
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,396
That's not a good
reason to get married.

808
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:02,941
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted.

809
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,819
I did,

810
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:08,947
but not like this.

811
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,658
Cooking methods.
<i>Questions are encouraged.</i>

812

815
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,001
Louise?

816
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,878
No, Thelma,
it's me.

817
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,547
Surprise.

818
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:29,968
I was just out there
and I was thinking that...

819
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:33,138
Well, I know I'm supposed
to be gone and all, but...

820
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:34,932
You know.

821
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,688
And I'm not having
a turd's luck getting
a ride out in this rain.

822
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,025
I was just
thinking about you.

823
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,156
This... This is crazy.

824
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,575
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get out of
your hair, all right?

825
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,660
I'm gonna...

826
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:57,162
Well, wait, wait.

827
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,665
Where you going?

828
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:06,213
Ah, I don't know.
You know, nowhere.

829
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,092
You think I'm happy
playing my one-night gigs
in Ramada Inn lounges?

830
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,845
You know, you think
you're the only one with
dreams that don't work out?

831
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,055
We both got
what we settled for.

832
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:18,100
I think maybe you just
don't love me anymore.

833
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,643
No, I do love you.

834
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,567
But I think
it's time to just

835
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,737
let go of
the old mistakes.

836
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,950
Just chalk it up to

837
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,287
bad timing.

838
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:42,374
I think it's time
to let go.

839
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:47,254
Look out. Look out.
Don't... Don't do it.

840
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:48,922
Oh! Oh! Oh!

841
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,466
Come on.

842
00:57:50,842 --> 00:57:51,967
You're too easy.
Come on. Here.

843
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,093
All right, all right.
I'll do it.

844
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,303
Your turn.

845
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,513
Come on.

846
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,391
Well, don't leave it...
Just don't leave them there.

847
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,476
All right, all right.

848
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:04,146
Gosh, what are you...

849
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,398
You see, this is
an unfair advantage.

850
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,401
You got...
You got too much
metal going here.

851
00:58:10,236 --> 00:58:13,113
You want to lighten
the load a little bit?
Yeah?

852
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:16,492
Yeah.

853
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,620
I think that's better.
What do you think?

854
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,371
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.

855
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,210
Take me, break me,
make me a man!
You're gonna hit your head!

856
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,836
Watch your head! Careful.

857
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,338
My head's fine.

858
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,256
Who are you, anyway?

859
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:36,678
I'm the great
and powerful Oz.
Who do you want to be?

860
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:39,848
Come on, tell me.
I know you're not
just some schoolboy.

861
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,391
Nobody ever
tells me shit.
Tell me.

862
00:58:41,476 --> 00:58:43,268
Oh, I'm just some guy.

863
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:47,564
A guy whose parole officer
is probably having
a shit fit right about now.

864
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,775
What do you mean,
parole officer?

865
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,277
What? Are you a criminal?

866
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,780
No. No,
not no more, Thelma.

867
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:56,949
Let's see.

868
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:59,076
Besides busting parole,
I haven't done
one wrong thing.

869
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,537
What'd you do?

870
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:02,704
I'm a robber.

871
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,873
You're a bank robber?

872
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,375
No. No.

873
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,794
I don't rob no banks.
Come on.

874
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,754
What'd you rob?

875
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,257
Hmm.

876
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,842
Well, let's see.

877
00:59:15,927 --> 00:59:17,553
Let's add it up here,

878
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,597
I robbed a gas station,

879
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:23,850
a couple of
convenience stores,
liquor stores.

880
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,979
Oh, my God.

881
00:59:28,773 --> 00:59:29,856
How?

882
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,527
Come on.

883
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,736
Okay.

884
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:37,239
Well, see, first you pick
your place, all right?

885
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,533
Then I just sit back
and watch it
for a little while.

886
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,286
Wait for that right moment
to make my move, see?

887
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,956
That's something
you gotta know up here.
That shit cannot be taught.

888
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,043
Yeah, then...
Shit, I don't want
to talk about this.

889
00:59:50,128 --> 00:59:51,920
Come on, I do.

890
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,048
All right.

891
00:59:55,675 --> 00:59:59,094
Then I'd waltz right in.

892
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,596
Yeah.

893
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:03,640
And I'd just kind of
waltz on in and I'd say,

894
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:07,102
"Ladies, gentlemen,
let's see who wins a prize
for keeping their cool.

895
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:09,438
"Simon says,
'Everybody down
on the floor.'

896
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:12,608
"Now, nobody loses
their head, then
nobody loses their head.

897
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,986
"Uh... You, sir. Yeah,
you do the honors.

898
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,363
"Take that cash
and put it into
that bag right there.

899
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,407
"You've got an amazing story
to tell your friends.

900
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:23,201
"If not, well,
you got a tag on your toe.
You decide."

901
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,371
Simple as that.

902
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:29,124
Then I'd just slip on out.

903
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:33,670
And get the hell
out of Dodge, yeah.

904
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,089
Mmm-hmm.

905
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:39,718
My goodness.
You were sure
gentlemanly about it.

906
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,679
Well, now,
I've always believed
that, done properly,

907
01:00:42,764 --> 01:00:46,308
armed robbery doesn't
have to be a totally
unpleasant experience.

908
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,896
What?
You're a real live
outlaw, aren't you?

909
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:56,276
Well, I may be an outlaw,
darling, but you're the one
who's stealing my heart.

910
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:59,696
You're smooth.
Oh. Yeah. Oh.

911
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,491
Isn't he? Isn't he?
You're smooth. Yeah.

912
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:03,575
That's right.

913
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,951
Keep it that way.

914
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,703
I'll pin you.

915
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,086
Remember when
we first met?

916
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,130
Yeah.

917
01:01:18,966 --> 01:01:20,926
What happened?
Tell me what you said.

918
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,220
I said you had
a nice pair of eyes.

919
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:28,308
And what'd I say?
Do you remember?

920
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:36,108
Yeah, you shut them.
Asked me if I knew
what color they were.

921
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:39,277
And what'd you say?

922
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,781
I didn't know.

923
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:49,371
Jimmy, what color
are my eyes?

924
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:55,168
They're brown.

925
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,336
Wait. Wait.

926
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:41,298
<i>Night upon the rocks</i>

927
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,717
<i>I'm over by the roadhouse</i>

928
01:02:43,801 --> 01:02:46,428
<i>With them rusted</i>
<i>engine blocks</i>

929
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,805
<i>A ghost town</i>
<i>with a gold mine</i>

930
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,016
<i>A pick axe in my head</i>

931
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,643
<i>I'm beggin'</i>
<i>mama please move over</i>

932
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:56,855
<i>Kick the stones</i>
<i>out of my bed</i>

933
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:09,159
<i>Met my sister Sandra</i>

934
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:12,245
<i>With them jewels</i>
<i>and the cross</i>

935
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,456
<i>Eyes on my lever now</i>

936
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,625
<i>She paint with chili sauce</i>

937
01:03:16,709 --> 01:03:19,294
<i>I cannot do no business</i>

938
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:21,630
<i>With your candle lit in red</i>

939
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:24,466
<i>I'm beggin'</i>
<i>mama please move over</i>

940
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:29,888
<i>Kick them stones</i>
<i>out of my bed</i>

941
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,220
Y'all want
some more coffee?

942
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,556
Thank you.

943
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,860
Look, I don't know
what's going on with you,
or what happened

944
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:27,195
or what you all did,

945
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:30,699
but I'm not gonna tell
anybody anything,

946
01:04:30,783 --> 01:04:33,410
and I'm not gonna say
that I even saw you.

947
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:37,455
Okay?

948
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:38,874
Damn, Jimmy,
what did you do,

949
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:41,918
take some kind of pill
that makes you say
all the right stuff?

950
01:04:45,172 --> 01:04:47,591
Yeah, I'm choking on it.

951
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:54,139
You sure you don't
want me to go with you?

952
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,894
I think it's probably not
a real good idea right now.

953
01:04:59,812 --> 01:05:04,733
But I'll catch up
with you later
on down the road.

954
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:08,278
Yeah.

955
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,159
Well,

956
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,703
my taxi's here.

957
01:05:20,833 --> 01:05:24,002
So, why don't you
just keep that?

958
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,756
Okay?
Thanks.

959
01:05:30,092 --> 01:05:31,843
I just want you
to be happy.

960
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,765
I am happy, sweetie.
Happy as I can be.

961
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:40,685
All right.

962
01:05:42,313 --> 01:05:43,688
All right.

963
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,442
Well, why don't you give
old Jimmy a kiss goodbye?

964
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,820
And I'll be getting
out of here.

965
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,242
Come here,
old Jimmy.

966
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,030
I'll be seeing you,
Louise.
Mmm-hmm.

967
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,246
Okay, have a safe trip.

968
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:57,679
It's a good thing
he left when he did.

969
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:00,682
We thought we were gonna
have to put out a fire.

970
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,321
Hi.

971
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,365
What happened
to your hair?

972
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:19,617
Nothing.
Got messed up.

973
01:07:21,412 --> 01:07:22,996
Thelma, what's
wrong with you?

974
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:27,292
Nothing. Why,
do I seem different?

975
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,712
Well, now that
you mention it, yeah.

976
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:34,340
You seem like you're crazy
or you're on drugs.

977
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:39,804
Well, I'm not on drugs,
but I might be crazy!

978
01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:46,686
Thelma, what happened?

979
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,275
What happened?
J. D. Came back.

980
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:54,069
Oh, my God, Louise.
Oh, my God.

981
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:55,278
Oh, no!
I can't believe it.

982
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:58,031
I mean, I just
can't believe it!
No!

983
01:07:58,115 --> 01:07:59,991
Oh, my God, it's like...

984
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:03,787
I finally understand
what all the fuss is about!

985
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:06,581
Now it's just like
a whole other ball game.

986
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:10,960
Darling, I'm so happy for you.
That's great. I really am.

987
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,172
You finally
got laid properly.
That's so sweet.

988
01:08:16,509 --> 01:08:17,592
Where is he now?

989
01:08:17,676 --> 01:08:19,177
He's taking a shower.

990
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,765
Thelma, you left him
alone in the room?

991
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,436
Where's the money?
Oh, my God.

992
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:29,771
Thelma, where's the money?

993
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,689
It's on the bed table.

994
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:33,399
It's okay.

995
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,988
It's on the nightstand!
It's okay.

996
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,330
Oh, God damn it!

997
01:08:48,165 --> 01:08:50,834
I've never been lucky!
Not one time!

998
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:53,878
Shit!

999
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:57,382
That son of a bitch
burned me.
I don't believe it.

1000
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,384
I don't believe it.

1001
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,347
Louise?

1002
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:07,725
You okay?

1003
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,021
Louise.

1004
01:09:14,942 --> 01:09:16,484
I'm sorry, I mean it.

1005
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:25,034
Louise, it's okay.

1006
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:27,954
It's okay.

1007
01:09:28,038 --> 01:09:30,248
No, Thelma,
it's not okay.

1008
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,750
It's definitely not okay.

1009
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,880
None of this is okay.

1010
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:41,759
I mean,
what are we gonna
do for money, huh?

1011
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,848
How we gonna get gas?
I mean, trading
on our good looks?

1012
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:53,313
I mean, oh, God damn it,
Thelma, it's not okay.

1013
01:09:58,736 --> 01:09:59,861
Louise.

1014
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,447
Hey, now you listen to me.

1015
01:10:03,782 --> 01:10:04,782
Don't you worry about it.

1016
01:10:05,826 --> 01:10:09,704
You hear me?
Come on, stand up!

1017
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:15,960
Louise, just don't you
worry about it. You hear?

1018
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:17,754
Come on.

1019
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,966
Come on, damn it!

1020
01:10:22,051 --> 01:10:24,135
Get your stuff
and let's get out
of here.

1021
01:10:25,638 --> 01:10:28,306
Move! Jesus Christ,
come on.

1022
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:30,183
Come on.

1023
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:35,271
Take your damn time.
Come on, here we go.

1024
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,003
Damn, damn.

1025
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,135
Afraid of a little
rain, Max?

1026
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:07,595
Phew!

1027
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,268
Well, come on in.
Wipe your feet.

1028
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:31,202
As you know,
we've tapped your phone in
the event that she calls in.

1029
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:34,205
Is that gonna cost me?

1030
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:35,623
Excuse me, may I?

1031
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:38,418
Hey, live it up.
That's what
it's there for.

1032
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:41,296
We're going to have
someone here at the house

1033
01:11:41,380 --> 01:11:43,423
on the phones
until we find them.

1034
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:47,302
The important thing is
not to let on that
you know anything.

1035
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,470
We want to try
and find out
where they are.

1036
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:50,596
Uh-huh.

1037
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,432
I don't want to
get too personal,

1038
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:55,435
but do you have
a good relationship
with your wife?

1039
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,855
I... I love Thelma.

1040
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,692
I don't intend
anything by that, sir.

1041
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:06,070
It's just a question
I have to ask.
Are you close with her?

1042
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,323
Yeah. I guess.

1043
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:12,702
I mean, I'm about
as close as I can be
to a nutcase like that.

1044
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:21,836
Yeah, well,
if she calls,
just be gentle.

1045
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:25,631
You know, like
you're really happy
to hear from her.

1046
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,259
Like you really miss her.

1047
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:29,886
Women love that shit.

1048
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,516
Okay, if you say so.

1049
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,523
- "Women love that shit."
- I'm sorry, it's just...

1050
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:58,498
Cool. Can I
wear these?

1051
01:13:06,131 --> 01:13:07,423
Want anything?

1052
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,319
Drive, Louise!

1053
01:14:10,612 --> 01:14:12,530
Drive! Drive the car!

1054
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:18,494
Go! Go!

1055
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,079
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1056
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,459
What happened?

1057
01:14:25,752 --> 01:14:27,086
You robbed the store?

1058
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:29,380
You robbed
the goddamn store?

1059
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:30,923
Well, we needed the money.

1060
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:33,676
It's not like
I killed anybody,
for God's sake.

1061
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,760
Thelma!

1062
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,054
I'm sorry.
We needed the money,
now we have it.

1063
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,308
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
Oh, shit, Thelma!

1064
01:14:40,392 --> 01:14:41,559
Louise. Louise.
Oh, shit!

1065
01:14:41,643 --> 01:14:44,604
Come on, get a grip.
Drive us to goddamn
Mexico, will you?

1066
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:45,771
Okay.

1067
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,982
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1068
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:52,862
Well, how... How'd you...
I mean, what'd you say?

1069
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,491
Well, I just waltzed on
in there and I said...

1070
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:58,951
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>
<i>This is a robbery.</i>

1071
01:14:59,036 --> 01:15:01,537
<i>Now,</i>
<i>if nobody loses their head,</i>
<i>nobody'll lose their head.</i>

1072
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,665
<i>Simon says, "Y'all lie down</i>
<i>on the floor, please,</i>
<i>right away."</i>

1073
01:15:04,750 --> 01:15:07,502
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Ma'am, would you get</i>
<i>down? Not you, sir.</i>

1074
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,837
<i>Let's see who'll win a prize</i>
<i>for keeping their cool.</i>

1075
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,255
<i>Sir, would you</i>
<i>do the honors?</i>

1076
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,299
<i>Take all the cash</i>
<i>out of the drawer,</i>
<i>put it in a paper bag.</i>

1077
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:14,342
Yes, ma'am.

1078
01:15:14,426 --> 01:15:16,761
<i>You're gonna have</i>
<i>an amazing story</i>
<i>to tell all your friends.</i>

1079
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:19,347
<i>If not, you'll have</i>
<i>a tag on your toe.</i>
<i>You decide.</i>

1080
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,308
<i>Hurry up. Let's go.</i>

1081
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,394
<i>Ma'am, would you be quiet?</i>
<i>Sir, get down, please.</i>

1082
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:27,021
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Just stay there.</i>

1083
01:15:27,523 --> 01:15:29,398
<i>Just get real comfortable.</i>

1084
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,653
<i>Hey, throw in some</i>
<i>bottles of Wild Turkey,</i>
<i>too, will you?</i>

1085
01:15:33,737 --> 01:15:34,820
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1086
01:15:36,698 --> 01:15:38,991
<i>Thank you. Now,</i>
<i>you get down, too.</i>
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

1087
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,578
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>I want to thank you all</i>
<i>for your cooperation.</i>

1088
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:45,790
<i>Now, stay down</i>
<i>on the floor till I'm gone.</i>
<i>Have a good day.</i>

1089
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,127
Jesus Christ!

1090
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:51,879
Good God.

1091
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,089
My Lord.

1092
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:06,435
Hey, Louise,
better slow down.

1093
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:09,397
I'd just die
if we get caught over
a speeding ticket.

1094
01:16:09,481 --> 01:16:12,733
You know, for the
first time in my life,
I wish this car wasn't green.

1095
01:16:14,820 --> 01:16:16,112
You sure we should
be driving like this?

1096
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:17,321
I mean,
in broad daylight
and everything?

1097
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:19,907
No, we shouldn't,
but I want to put
some distance between us

1098
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,577
and the scene of
our last goddamn crime!

1099
01:16:26,498 --> 01:16:29,584
Oh, man!
You wouldn't
have believed it.

1100
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:31,794
It was like I'd been
doing it all my life.

1101
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:33,671
I mean, nobody
would believe it.

1102
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,924
Think you found
your calling?

1103
01:16:37,009 --> 01:16:38,884
Maybe. Maybe.

1104
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,428
The call of the wild!

1105
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:45,474
You are disturbed!

1106
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:47,351
Yeah, I believe I am.

1107
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:48,894
Whoo!

1108
01:17:02,326 --> 01:17:04,535
Thelma, don't you litter.

1109
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,040
Wait a minute. Shoot.

1110
01:17:09,124 --> 01:17:12,209
God, I hate when you...
This always happens
when you're in a hurry.

1111
01:17:13,253 --> 01:17:16,464
Damn. What are you gonna do?
Just stay drunk all day?

1112
01:17:18,133 --> 01:17:19,383
Try to.

1113
01:17:24,765 --> 01:17:27,767
Oh. Isn't that nice?
Truck drivers
are always so nice.

1114
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,352
Best drivers on the road.

1115
01:17:34,107 --> 01:17:37,401
Oh, Lord.
How original.

1116
01:17:47,454 --> 01:17:48,704
Thank you.

1117
01:17:50,248 --> 01:17:52,333
Oh, man!
That's disgusting!

1118
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,627
You pig!
Just a fucking pig!

1119
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,045
That's gross!
What's he gotta do
that for, anyway?

1120
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:57,463
I don't know.

1121
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,424
They think we like it.

1122
01:18:00,509 --> 01:18:03,052
They think it turns us on
is what they think.

1123
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:04,261
Shut up!

1124
01:18:42,008 --> 01:18:43,300
James Lennox?

1125
01:18:44,428 --> 01:18:45,553
Yeah, who wants to know?

1126
01:18:45,637 --> 01:18:46,929
Arkansas State Police.

1127
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:23,340
Hi.

1128
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:04,173
Thelma.

1129
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:08,594
What?

1130
01:20:08,762 --> 01:20:10,054
I want you to call Darryl.

1131
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:12,807
What for?

1132
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,855
I want you to find out
if he knows anything.

1133
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:22,566
If you think he does,
you gotta hang up the phone,

1134
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,235
'cause that means
the police have told him,

1135
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,529
and the phone's
probably tapped.

1136
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:29,865
Tapped the phone?
What are you
talking about?

1137
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:32,910
Come on, Thelma,
murder one
and armed robbery?

1138
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:35,579
Murder one?
We can't even say
it was self-defense?

1139
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,665
Well, it wasn't.
We were walking away.
We got away.

1140
01:20:37,749 --> 01:20:39,250
Yeah, but they
don't know that.

1141
01:20:39,334 --> 01:20:41,085
It was just you
and me there.

1142
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:42,586
I'll say he raped me
and you had to shoot him.

1143
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:44,213
That's almost the truth.

1144
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:46,549
It won't work.
Why not?

1145
01:20:46,633 --> 01:20:49,552
Because there's
no physical evidence.
We can't prove he did it.

1146
01:20:49,636 --> 01:20:52,805
We can't even
probably prove by now
that he touched you.

1147
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,432
God.

1148
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,811
Law is some tricky
shit, isn't it?

1149
01:21:02,732 --> 01:21:04,358
Hey, how do you know
about all this stuff
anyway?

1150
01:21:04,442 --> 01:21:06,402
Besides,
what're we gonna say
about the robbery?

1151
01:21:06,486 --> 01:21:07,695
There's no excuse for that.

1152
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:10,030
There's no such thing
as justifiable robbery.

1153
01:21:10,115 --> 01:21:13,117
All right, Louise,
will you?
Where'd you get this?

1154
01:21:14,452 --> 01:21:15,619
Stole it.

1155
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,008
Hi.

1156
01:21:29,801 --> 01:21:30,926
Hi!

1157
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:32,720
Huh!

1158
01:21:34,681 --> 01:21:36,223
Who's the nut?

1159
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,808
That's Mrs. Dickinson's
husband.

1160
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:38,934
Excuse me.

1161
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,812
Well, shit twice
and fall back in it.

1162
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:43,480
God.

1163
01:21:45,901 --> 01:21:48,402
Where'd you get
the $6,600 in cash?

1164
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:51,864
A friend.

1165
01:21:52,324 --> 01:21:54,742
We spoke
with a gentleman today
who says he delivered

1166
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:57,328
very close
to that same amount to
a Ms. Louise Sawyer.

1167
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,913
Do you know her, too?

1168
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:01,498
Yes, sir.

1169
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:04,543
Yeah, I believe
she's the woman
driving the car.

1170
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,923
He said he took it
to a motel
in Oklahoma City.

1171
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,634
He also says
that at that time
he met a man.

1172
01:22:12,218 --> 01:22:14,345
He identified you
through a series
of mug shots.

1173
01:22:15,555 --> 01:22:18,933
He also told us that
you and Mrs. Dickinson
seemed close.

1174
01:22:19,392 --> 01:22:20,809
Is that true?

1175
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:23,187
Well, sir,

1176
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26,941
you might say
we had a meeting of
the minds, yeah.

1177
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,694
Are you aware
that Mrs. Dickinson
and Ms. Sawyer

1178
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,571
are wanted
in connection
with a murder?

1179
01:22:32,656 --> 01:22:35,532
Murder? What,
Thelma? Damn!

1180
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,535
Did they ever indicate
that they might be
on the run from the law?

1181
01:22:40,413 --> 01:22:42,289
You know, sir,
now that you mention it,

1182
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:43,958
they might have
seemed a little bit jumpy.

1183
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:47,336
You know what?
What?

1184
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:49,964
You're starting
to irritate me.

1185
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,382
Yeah, me, too.

1186
01:22:52,092 --> 01:22:53,384
That'll happen.

1187
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:55,761
Say, you two boys
have a lot in common.

1188
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,180
Maybe I should
just step out
of the room for a sec.

1189
01:23:01,518 --> 01:23:02,726
I got a better idea.

1190
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,147
Do you mind if
I speak to him alone
for a minute?

1191
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:29,169
What? What'd I do?
Nothing, that's what.

1192
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:33,507
Tell you something,
this is a crock of shit,
Mr. John fucking Law.

1193
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,600
Son, I got a feeling
about something and...

1194
01:23:43,685 --> 01:23:44,685
Yeah?

1195
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,687
...I just wanna
ask your opinion.

1196
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:51,608
Do you think Thelma Dickinson
would have committed
armed robbery

1197
01:23:51,693 --> 01:23:53,610
if you hadn't taken
all their money?

1198
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:57,740
Get your foot
off that table.

1199
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:04,538
Cat got your tongue?

1200
01:24:04,622 --> 01:24:05,664
No.

1201
01:24:06,624 --> 01:24:08,083
Well, how... How do
you know I took it?

1202
01:24:08,668 --> 01:24:10,169
How do you know
they didn't...

1203
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:13,213
Don't you fucking
lie to me!

1204
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,093
There's two girls out there
that had a chance.
They had a chance.

1205
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,763
And now you've
screwed it up for them.
No.

1206
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,890
And now they're in
some serious trouble.

1207
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:25,142
And I'm gonna hold you
personally responsible

1208
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:27,311
for at least part of it
if anything happens to them.

1209
01:24:28,146 --> 01:24:30,147
I got no feeling for you.

1210
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:33,233
Now, you're either
gonna tell me every
damn thing you know,

1211
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:36,070
so there's a small chance
that I can actually
do them some good,

1212
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:40,991
or I'm gonna be all over you
like a fly on shit for the
rest of your natural life.

1213
01:24:41,326 --> 01:24:43,827
Your miseries will be
my goddamn mission in life.

1214
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:45,704
Yes, sir.

1215
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,542
Okay?
Yeah. Yeah.
That's right.

1216
01:24:50,627 --> 01:24:51,752
We understand each other?

1217
01:24:51,836 --> 01:24:53,170
Yeah.
Okay.

1218
01:24:58,093 --> 01:24:59,343
Mr. Dickinson?
Yeah?

1219
01:24:59,886 --> 01:25:02,304
If you'd just hang on,
I want a word with you.

1220
01:25:02,847 --> 01:25:04,515
I like your wife.

1221
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:07,518
Come back here!

1222
01:25:07,727 --> 01:25:08,769
Hey, hey!

1223
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,854
Come back here,
you little shit!

1224
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:14,149
Come here! Come here!
All right, all right,
all right.

1225
01:25:14,234 --> 01:25:16,610
Come here!
Come here!
Come on!

1226
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:18,320
Come on, now.
I'll kill him!

1227
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,114
Let's
go home now.
I'll kill you!

1228
01:25:43,263 --> 01:25:44,805
What will it be,
ladies?

1229
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:46,557
Fill her up.
There you go.

1230
01:25:47,225 --> 01:25:48,559
Um...

1231
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:52,604
Excuse me,
do you have a phone?

1232
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,817
Thank you.

1233
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,318
Thelma,
listen up, now.

1234
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,988
If you even think
he knows, I mean,
even if you're not sure,

1235
01:26:01,364 --> 01:26:03,157
I want you to hang up,
you understand?

1236
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,324
Yeah.

1237
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:43,447
Hello.

1238
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:45,282
Darryl, it's me.

1239
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:46,700
Thelma, hello!

1240
01:26:49,954 --> 01:26:50,996
He knows.
Shit.

1241
01:26:51,456 --> 01:26:52,831
I need more time.

1242
01:26:55,668 --> 01:26:58,503
What? All I said
was "hello."

1243
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:23,695
Yep?

1244
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,031
Darryl,
<i>this is Louise.</i>
<i>Let me talk to the police.</i>

1245
01:27:26,115 --> 01:27:27,866
Hey, Louise.
<i>Hi.</i>

1246
01:27:29,118 --> 01:27:31,161
<i>Let me talk to the police.</i>

1247
01:27:32,372 --> 01:27:34,706
What do you mean?
There's no police here.

1248
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,209
Hey, where
are you girls anyway?

1249
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:40,087
<i>Just wait... Darryl,</i>
<i>will you let me talk to</i>
<i>whoever's in charge there?</i>

1250
01:27:40,171 --> 01:27:41,880
How do you know
there's...

1251
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:44,341
Hello, Ms. Sawyer?

1252
01:27:45,009 --> 01:27:48,887
I'm Investigator Hal Slocumb,
Arkansas State Police.

1253
01:27:48,972 --> 01:27:50,013
How are you?

1254
01:27:50,348 --> 01:27:52,099
Well, I've been better.

1255
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:55,310
<i>Be careful with that gun.</i>

1256
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:56,520
Yes, I know.

1257
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,147
<i>You girls are in</i>
<i>some hot water.</i>

1258
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,941
<i>You both okay?</i>
<i>Neither one of you hurt?</i>

1259
01:28:01,025 --> 01:28:03,610
Yes, sir, we're...
We're fine.
We're both fine.

1260
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:04,903
Good.

1261
01:28:05,405 --> 01:28:07,114
<i>You want to tell me</i>
<i>what happened?</i>

1262
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:09,950
Sure, over coffee,
sometime. I'll buy.

1263
01:28:10,034 --> 01:28:14,162
I want you to know
neither one of you are
charged with murder yet.

1264
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,332
You're just still
wanted for questioning.

1265
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:22,004
Although now,
Mrs. Dickinson's wanted in
Oklahoma for armed robbery.

1266
01:28:24,549 --> 01:28:27,843
No kidding? Look,
we gotta go. I'll
call you back, all right?

1267
01:28:27,927 --> 01:28:30,053
Ms. Sawyer,
I don't think you all are
gonna make it to Mexico.

1268
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:34,725
<i>We should talk. Please,</i>
<i>I want to help you.</i>

1269
01:28:35,727 --> 01:28:36,893
Shit.

1270
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:41,064
God, that J. D. Kid
is a little shit.

1271
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:44,276
What? What?

1272
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,739
Thelma, how did they know
we're going to Mexico, huh?

1273
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:49,990
How did they know that?

1274
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:55,037
You told that
thieving little shit
where we were going?

1275
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,372
Oh.

1276
01:28:57,957 --> 01:29:02,753
I just... I just told him
if he ever got to Mexico,
he should look us up.

1277
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,048
But I... I asked him
not to tell.

1278
01:29:06,132 --> 01:29:08,383
I mean, I...

1279
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,886
I thought he would
not tell anybody,
you know.

1280
01:29:11,012 --> 01:29:12,512
Why?
I didn't think
he'd tell anybody.

1281
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,182
Why? What's he got to lose?
Except my life savings,
of course.

1282
01:29:15,266 --> 01:29:16,350
Oh, shit!

1283
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:17,893
Thelma, God damn it!

1284
01:29:19,103 --> 01:29:21,229
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean...

1285
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:23,065
Oh, God damn it, Thelma!

1286
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:25,609
Look, up until now,
we had only two things
going for us,

1287
01:29:25,693 --> 01:29:27,194
one, nobody knew
where we were,
and two,

1288
01:29:27,278 --> 01:29:28,570
no one knew where
we were going.

1289
01:29:28,654 --> 01:29:30,697
Now one of the things
we had going for us is gone!

1290
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:43,210
Look, Thelma,
you just gotta stop
talking to people.

1291
01:29:43,294 --> 01:29:45,212
You gotta stop
being so open.

1292
01:29:45,296 --> 01:29:47,381
We're fugitives now,
all right?

1293
01:29:48,299 --> 01:29:50,550
Let's start
behaving like that.

1294
01:29:50,802 --> 01:29:51,843
You're right.

1295
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,345
Thank you.
Okay.

1296
01:29:56,099 --> 01:29:57,516
<i>I was wondering...</i>

1297
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,936
<i>Listen, little boy,</i>
<i>of course I want you to go.</i>

1298
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:04,231
<i>If that's</i>
<i>what's worrying you,</i>
<i>please don't think...</i>

1299
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:06,983
<i>No, I wasn't</i>
<i>worrying about that.</i>

1300
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:10,153
<i>I knew you'd want me</i>
<i>to take the job, sure,</i>
<i>but...</i>

1301
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,491
Sorry.

1302
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:17,035
Judy,
<i>let's get married.</i>

1303
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:28,380
My God,
this is beautiful.

1304
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,174
It surely is.

1305
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:35,512
I always wanted to travel,
I just never got
the opportunity.

1306
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:38,890
You got it now.

1307
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,321
<i>The morning sun</i>

1308
01:30:53,406 --> 01:30:59,119
<i>Touched lightly on</i>
<i>the eyes of Lucy Jordan</i>

1309
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:02,789
<i>In a white suburban bedroom</i>

1310
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:06,835
<i>In a white suburban town</i>

1311
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:10,714
<i>As she lay there</i>
<i>beneath the covers</i>

1312
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:14,718
<i>Dreaming of</i>
<i>a thousand lovers</i>

1313
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:18,805
<i>Till the world</i>
<i>turned to orange</i>

1314
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:24,060
<i>And the room</i>
<i>went spinning round</i>

1315
01:31:25,062 --> 01:31:28,064
<i>At the age of thirty-seven</i>

1316
01:31:29,066 --> 01:31:30,859
<i>She realized</i>

1317
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:36,698
<i>She'd never ride through</i>
<i>Paris in a sports car</i>

1318
01:31:36,782 --> 01:31:41,786
<i>With the warm wind</i>
<i>in her hair</i>

1319
01:31:42,747 --> 01:31:46,625
<i>So she let</i>
<i>the phone keep ringing</i>

1320
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:50,670
<i>And she sat there</i>
<i>softly singing</i>

1321
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:52,964
<i>Little nursery rhymes</i>

1322
01:31:53,049 --> 01:31:58,595
<i>She'd memorized in</i>
<i>her daddy's easy chair</i>

1323
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,975
<i>At the age of thirty-seven</i>

1324
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:08,230
<i>She knew she'd found forever</i>

1325
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:12,234
<i>As she rode along</i>
<i>through Paris</i>

1326
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:15,612
<i>With the warm wind</i>
<i>in her hair</i>

1327
01:32:49,105 --> 01:32:50,647
What's going on?

1328
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:55,694
Nothing.

1329
01:33:09,125 --> 01:33:12,419
Shit. Well, we don't need
the East Coast anymore.

1330
01:33:16,757 --> 01:33:19,843
Hey, look!
Look who it is,
it's that guy.

1331
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:21,761
I'll be darned.
Just ignore him.

1332
01:33:24,265 --> 01:33:28,351
Hey, baby!
I'm your Captain
Muff-Diver!

1333
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,063
Your storm trooper
of love!

1334
01:33:38,362 --> 01:33:39,904
I ignored him.

1335
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:21,821
What?

1336
01:34:22,365 --> 01:34:24,449
What?
Harlan.

1337
01:34:27,036 --> 01:34:28,953
What about it?
Nothing.

1338
01:34:29,955 --> 01:34:31,539
Just...

1339
01:34:32,416 --> 01:34:35,752
Just the look
on his face when...

1340
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:37,462
What?

1341
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:41,216
He sure wasn't
expecting that.

1342
01:34:45,262 --> 01:34:46,638
"Suck my dick."

1343
01:34:50,059 --> 01:34:51,226
Thelma, it's not funny.

1344
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:54,396
I know.

1345
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:04,322
It happened to you,
didn't it?

1346
01:35:06,617 --> 01:35:08,451
What? What are you
talking about?

1347
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:10,578
In Texas.

1348
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:13,957
I mean, that's what...
That's what happened,
isn't it?

1349
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,710
You was raped.

1350
01:35:21,590 --> 01:35:24,426
Hey, now, look.
I'm warning you.
Just drop it.

1351
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,553
I'm not gonna
talk about that.

1352
01:35:28,097 --> 01:35:29,597
You understand?
Yeah.

1353
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,558
I'm not talking about it.
Okay.

1354
01:35:31,642 --> 01:35:33,226
You understand?
Yeah.

1355
01:35:33,477 --> 01:35:34,936
Okay, Louise.

1356
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:47,157
It's okay.

1357
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:23,818
Oh, shit!

1358
01:36:23,903 --> 01:36:25,987
Thelma, we're getting
pulled over.
All right.

1359
01:36:27,406 --> 01:36:28,698
Shit! Shit!

1360
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,742
What'd you wanna do?
What should we do?

1361
01:36:30,826 --> 01:36:32,494
I don't know.
I don't know.

1362
01:36:32,578 --> 01:36:33,870
All right, we'll just
go play it by ear.

1363
01:36:33,954 --> 01:36:36,289
Maybe he doesn't know.
Maybe he's just gonna
give me a ticket.

1364
01:36:36,373 --> 01:36:39,125
Oh, God.
Oh, God, please don't
let us get caught.

1365
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:41,294
God, please, please, God.
Don't let us get caught.

1366
01:36:41,378 --> 01:36:42,712
All right, I'm just
gonna pull over.

1367
01:37:01,023 --> 01:37:02,398
<i>Turn off your engine.</i>

1368
01:37:09,073 --> 01:37:10,490
He's putting on his hat.

1369
01:37:22,419 --> 01:37:23,878
Oh, my God,
he's a Nazi.

1370
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,339
What's he doing?
He's kind of
walking this way.

1371
01:37:33,889 --> 01:37:35,139
Hello, Officer.

1372
01:37:36,058 --> 01:37:37,308
Is there a problem?

1373
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,769
You want to let me
see your license, please?

1374
01:37:40,938 --> 01:37:42,105
Right.

1375
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:44,607
Here it is.

1376
01:37:45,484 --> 01:37:47,026
You wanna take it
out of your wallet,
please?

1377
01:37:47,653 --> 01:37:48,820
All right.

1378
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:52,866
I told you to slow down.
Officer, I told her
to slow down.

1379
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:55,243
She did.
How fast was I going?

1380
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:57,370
About 110.
Oh.

1381
01:37:57,830 --> 01:37:59,706
You want to get out
of the car, please?

1382
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,207
Yes, sir. Sure.

1383
01:38:05,671 --> 01:38:07,046
Come with me, please.

1384
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:08,298
Yes, sir.

1385
01:38:11,385 --> 01:38:13,094
This your vehicle?

1386
01:38:13,178 --> 01:38:14,470
Yes, sir, that is.

1387
01:38:17,766 --> 01:38:19,934
You want to get in
the car, please?

1388
01:38:20,019 --> 01:38:21,102
Yes, sir.

1389
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:24,314
Front or the back?

1390
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:25,481
Front.

1391
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,487
Do you want to take off
your eyewear, please?

1392
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:32,697
Yes, sir.

1393
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,912
Am I in trouble,
Officer?

1394
01:38:38,996 --> 01:38:41,831
As far as I'm concerned,
yes, ma'am, you're in
a lot of trouble.

1395
01:38:43,375 --> 01:38:45,126
Hello, this is 9-8...

1396
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:48,421
You want to step back
and get in your car
again, please?

1397
01:38:48,505 --> 01:38:51,925
Officer, I am so
sorry about this,

1398
01:38:52,009 --> 01:38:53,676
but would you
let go of that?

1399
01:38:55,012 --> 01:38:57,221
Now, I really,
really apologize,

1400
01:38:57,306 --> 01:39:00,183
but would you put your hands
on the steering wheel?

1401
01:39:00,267 --> 01:39:01,976
See, if you get
on that radio,

1402
01:39:02,061 --> 01:39:04,687
you're gonna find out that
we're wanted in two states

1403
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:07,941
and probably considered
armed and dangerous,
at least I am,

1404
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:11,194
and then our whole plan's
just gonna be
all shot to hell.

1405
01:39:11,278 --> 01:39:13,363
Louise, take his gun.

1406
01:39:14,782 --> 01:39:16,950
Take his gun,
Louise.
Right there.

1407
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:19,827
Right.
I'm real sorry.
Excuse me.

1408
01:39:19,912 --> 01:39:21,996
You want to step out
of the car, please?

1409
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:27,085
I swear,
three days ago,

1410
01:39:27,169 --> 01:39:29,170
neither one of us
would've ever pulled
a stunt like this,

1411
01:39:29,254 --> 01:39:32,215
but if you was ever
to meet my husband,
you'd understand why.

1412
01:39:33,217 --> 01:39:35,677
You want to put your hands
on your head, please?

1413
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:37,553
Louise.
What?

1414
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:39,597
Shoot the radio.
Right.

1415
01:39:44,103 --> 01:39:46,646
The police radio,
Louise.

1416
01:39:46,730 --> 01:39:48,064
Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.

1417
01:39:51,860 --> 01:39:53,861
Got it.
Okay. All right.

1418
01:39:53,946 --> 01:39:56,447
You want to step to
the back of the car,
please?

1419
01:39:57,825 --> 01:39:59,325
Louise, get the keys.

1420
01:40:05,666 --> 01:40:07,875
Thelma, what is it?
What's wrong?

1421
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:09,002
Air holes.

1422
01:40:09,253 --> 01:40:10,586
Open the trunk.

1423
01:40:12,756 --> 01:40:15,675
Shit, Thelma.
Who would've
thought it?

1424
01:40:16,051 --> 01:40:17,427
You want to step
into the trunk,
please?

1425
01:40:19,346 --> 01:40:22,807
Please, I have
a wife and kids.
Please!

1426
01:40:23,475 --> 01:40:25,643
You do? Well,
you're lucky.

1427
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:28,271
You be sweet to them,
especially your wife.

1428
01:40:28,355 --> 01:40:31,190
My husband
wasn't sweet to me,
look how I turned out.

1429
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,317
Now, go on.
Get in there.

1430
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:36,487
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a second.
Wait a second. Excuse me.

1431
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:40,450
Oh. Wait a minute.
Officer, could I have
your belt, please?

1432
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:43,870
Extra ammo.
Good idea.

1433
01:40:43,954 --> 01:40:47,331
And... And could I
trade glasses
with you, maybe?

1434
01:40:49,460 --> 01:40:50,877
Thanks. Okay.

1435
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,295
- Is that it?
- Uh-huh.

1436
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:54,005
Right.

1437
01:40:54,798 --> 01:40:57,050
Officer, I'm real
sorry about this.

1438
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:58,468
I apologize, also.

1439
01:41:00,763 --> 01:41:01,763
Go.

1440
01:41:07,936 --> 01:41:09,812
You ready?
Hit it.

1441
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:16,152
Now, I know it's crazy,

1442
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:19,822
but I just feel like
I got a knack for this shit.

1443
01:41:19,907 --> 01:41:21,324
I believe you do.

1444
01:41:24,286 --> 01:41:25,453
Drive like hell.

1445
01:41:32,377 --> 01:41:34,754
The one thing
I can't figure out is
whether these girls are

1446
01:41:34,838 --> 01:41:37,465
real smart
or just real,
real lucky.

1447
01:41:38,175 --> 01:41:39,675
It don't matter.

1448
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:43,638
Brains'll only get you
so far and luck
always runs out.

1449
01:41:46,642 --> 01:41:48,267
Louise,
we still going to Mexico?

1450
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,393
Yeah.

1451
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:53,022
Then aren't we going
in the wrong direction?

1452
01:41:53,565 --> 01:41:56,442
Well, I figure if you
take a state policeman,
shoot off his car,

1453
01:41:56,527 --> 01:41:58,194
take his gun
and lock him
in the trunk,

1454
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:00,613
it's best just to get on
out of the state if you can.

1455
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:01,739
I heard that.

1456
01:42:02,699 --> 01:42:03,699
Hey!

1457
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:06,702
Don't dent my car!

1458
01:42:11,834 --> 01:42:13,334
I think I fucked up.

1459
01:42:16,004 --> 01:42:18,548
I think I got us
in a situation where
we both could get killed.

1460
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:23,302
Damn, I don't know
why I just didn't go
to the police right away.

1461
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,680
You know why.
You already said.

1462
01:42:26,974 --> 01:42:27,974
What'd I say again?

1463
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:29,684
Nobody'd believe us.

1464
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:33,312
We'd still get in trouble,
we'd still have
our lives ruined.

1465
01:42:34,731 --> 01:42:36,357
You know what else?
What?

1466
01:42:37,526 --> 01:42:39,152
That guy was hurting me.

1467
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:42,989
If you hadn't come out
when you did, he would've
hurt me a lot worse.

1468
01:42:43,073 --> 01:42:44,824
And probably nothing
would've happened to him

1469
01:42:44,908 --> 01:42:46,742
'cause everybody did see me
dancing with him all night.

1470
01:42:46,952 --> 01:42:49,370
They would've made out
like I'd asked for it.

1471
01:42:50,914 --> 01:42:53,791
My life would've been
ruined a whole lot
worse than it is now.

1472
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:56,085
At least now
I'm having some fun.

1473
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,423
And I'm not sorry
that son of a bitch
is dead.

1474
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:03,301
I'm just sorry
it was you that
did it and not me.

1475
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:21,944
Hello?

1476
01:43:22,279 --> 01:43:23,696
Let me talk to Slocumb.

1477
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:26,449
She wants to talk to you.

1478
01:43:32,289 --> 01:43:33,289
Hello, Louise.

1479
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:34,373
Hi.

1480
01:43:34,458 --> 01:43:36,209
<i>How are things</i>
<i>going out there?</i>

1481
01:43:36,293 --> 01:43:39,962
Weird. We got some kind of
a snowball effect happening
here or something.

1482
01:43:40,047 --> 01:43:41,380
You're still
with us, though.

1483
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,506
Mmm-hmm.

1484
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:44,342
<i>You're somewhere on</i>
<i>the face of the earth.</i>

1485
01:43:44,426 --> 01:43:47,094
Well, we're not
in the middle of nowhere,
but we can see it from here.

1486
01:43:48,972 --> 01:43:50,306
I swear.

1487
01:43:50,891 --> 01:43:52,850
Louise, I almost feel
like I know you.

1488
01:43:53,018 --> 01:43:54,227
Well, you don't.

1489
01:43:54,311 --> 01:43:56,604
You're getting in deeper
every moment you're gone.

1490
01:43:56,688 --> 01:43:59,232
Would you believe me
if I told you this whole
thing was an accident?

1491
01:43:59,316 --> 01:44:01,192
I do believe you.

1492
01:44:01,276 --> 01:44:04,111
That's what I want
everybody to believe.

1493
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:06,864
Trouble is,
it doesn't look
like an accident.

1494
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,076
And you're not here
to tell me about it.

1495
01:44:10,661 --> 01:44:13,079
I need your help here.
Did Harlan Puckett...

1496
01:44:13,163 --> 01:44:14,372
<i>I don't wanna</i>
<i>talk about it.</i>

1497
01:44:14,456 --> 01:44:16,749
You wanna come on in?

1498
01:44:16,833 --> 01:44:18,042
<i>Don't think so.</i>

1499
01:44:19,086 --> 01:44:22,338
Then I'm sorry.
We're gonna have to
charge you with murder.

1500
01:44:23,006 --> 01:44:24,924
<i>Now, do you want to</i>
<i>come out of this alive?</i>

1501
01:44:25,008 --> 01:44:29,303
You know, certain words
and phrases just keep
drifting through my mind.

1502
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:33,599
Things like "incarceration,"
"cavity search,"
"death by electrocution,"

1503
01:44:33,684 --> 01:44:36,394
"life imprisonment,"
shit like that.
You know what I'm saying?

1504
01:44:36,478 --> 01:44:38,479
So do I want to
come out alive?

1505
01:44:39,189 --> 01:44:40,982
I don't know, I...

1506
01:44:46,154 --> 01:44:49,490
I don't know. I think
we're gonna have
to think about that.

1507
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:53,536
Louise, I'll do anything.

1508
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:58,541
I know what's
making you run.

1509
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:01,961
I know what happened
to you in Texas.

1510
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,802
Come on, Louise.

1511
01:45:11,179 --> 01:45:12,722
Don't blow it.

1512
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:14,223
We got it!

1513
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:16,809
Give it to me.

1514
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:26,152
Max, you gotta
take me there.

1515
01:45:26,236 --> 01:45:27,570
No, Hal, cannot do.

1516
01:45:27,696 --> 01:45:29,989
I'm the only one
she's ever spoken to.
You've done a good job.

1517
01:45:30,073 --> 01:45:31,699
You're no good to me now.
You're no good to me.

1518
01:45:31,783 --> 01:45:33,159
There's nothing
you can do
for me now.

1519
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:35,786
I don't want anybody
losing their heads!

1520
01:45:35,871 --> 01:45:37,204
You know what happens.

1521
01:45:37,289 --> 01:45:38,664
The volume gets
turned way up,

1522
01:45:38,749 --> 01:45:40,958
and the next thing you know,
these girls are
gonna get shot!

1523
01:45:53,263 --> 01:45:54,472
What?

1524
01:45:56,266 --> 01:45:59,018
You're not gonna
give up on me,
are you?

1525
01:45:59,102 --> 01:46:00,144
What do you mean?

1526
01:46:01,480 --> 01:46:03,397
You're not gonna
make a deal
with that guy?

1527
01:46:04,274 --> 01:46:06,609
I mean,
I just want to know.

1528
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,404
Thelma, I'm not
making any deals.

1529
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:17,912
I mean, I'd understand
if you was thinking about it.

1530
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:22,249
In a way, you got
something to go back for,
Jimmy and all.

1531
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:23,667
Jimmy's not an option.

1532
01:46:26,755 --> 01:46:27,922
But...

1533
01:46:29,299 --> 01:46:35,679
I don't know, you know,
something's, like,
crossed over in me.

1534
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:38,766
And I can't go back.

1535
01:46:40,185 --> 01:46:43,604
I mean, I just
couldn't live.

1536
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:47,316
I know. I know
what you mean.

1537
01:46:49,653 --> 01:46:53,280
Anyway, we don't
want to end up on
the damn Geraldo show.

1538
01:46:54,533 --> 01:46:55,825
Yeah.

1539
01:47:03,625 --> 01:47:06,127
They're charging us
with murder.

1540
01:47:07,379 --> 01:47:08,504
Ooh.

1541
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:11,090
Yeah, they say that
we gotta figure out

1542
01:47:11,174 --> 01:47:12,675
if we want to come in
dead or alive.

1543
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:17,513
Gosh, didn't he say
anything positive at all?

1544
01:47:44,791 --> 01:47:45,791
You awake?

1545
01:47:47,294 --> 01:47:49,253
Guess you could
call it that.
My eyes are open.

1546
01:47:50,505 --> 01:47:53,215
Me, too.
I feel awake.

1547
01:47:53,467 --> 01:47:54,550
Good.

1548
01:47:55,510 --> 01:47:56,635
Wide-awake.

1549
01:47:57,345 --> 01:48:00,639
I don't remember ever
feeling this awake.
You know what I mean?

1550
01:48:02,434 --> 01:48:04,059
Everything looks different.

1551
01:48:05,604 --> 01:48:08,898
You feel like that, too,
like you got something
to look forward to?

1552
01:48:11,651 --> 01:48:14,236
We'll be drinking margaritas
by the sea, mamacita.

1553
01:48:15,071 --> 01:48:16,238
Hey, we could
change our names.

1554
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:17,823
We could live
in a hacienda.

1555
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:20,868
I'm gonna get a job.
I'm gonna work at Club Med.

1556
01:48:21,244 --> 01:48:22,411
Yeah.

1557
01:48:23,872 --> 01:48:27,082
Now what kind of a deal
is that cop gonna have
to come up with to beat that?

1558
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,877
Have to be pretty good.
Have to be pretty
damn good.

1559

01:49:08,917 --> 01:49:09,917
See if that's him.

1566
01:49:11,753 --> 01:49:14,088
It's him.
It's definitely him.

1567
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:16,298
Pass him.

Great!

You girls about

1577
01:50:02,637 --> 01:50:03,721

Fresno.

1590
01:51:08,578 --> 01:51:10,245
We've been seeing you
all over the place.

1591
01:51:10,830 --> 01:51:13,749
Why don't you take
off those shades?
I want to see your eyes.

01:51:15,168 --> 01:51:17,378
Yeah, I been
seeing you, too.

1593
01:51:17,754 --> 01:51:19,797
Yeah, we think
you have really
bad manners.

1594
01:51:19,881 --> 01:51:21,507
Yeah.

1595
01:51:21,591 --> 01:51:25,302
Yeah, where do you get off
behaving like that with
women you don't even know?

1596
01:51:25,887 --> 01:51:26,887
Huh?

1597
01:51:29,349 --> 01:51:31,308
How'd you feel if somebody
did that to your mother?

1598
01:51:31,976 --> 01:51:34,311
Or your sister?
Or your wife?

talking about?

1601
01:51:38,525 --> 01:51:40,442
You know good and damn well
what I'm talking about.

1602
01:51:40,902 --> 01:51:43,404
I mean, really.
That business
with your tongue.

1603
01:51:43,488 --> 01:51:45,406
What is that?
That is disgusting!

1604
01:51:45,490 --> 01:51:47,533
And, oh, my God,
that other shit of
pointing to your lap.

1605
01:51:47,617 --> 01:51:49,827
I mean, what is that
supposed to mean
exactly, huh?

1606
01:51:49,911 --> 01:51:53,288
Does that mean "Pull over.
I wanna show you what
a big, fat slob I am"?

1607
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:55,124
Yeah, or does that mean,
"Suck my dick"?

1608
01:51:56,042 --> 01:51:58,127
You women are crazy!
You got that right.

1609
01:51:58,545 --> 01:52:00,796
We think
you should apologize.

1610
01:52:00,880 --> 01:52:03,048
I ain't apologizing
for shit!

1611
01:52:03,133 --> 01:52:04,633
You say you're sorry.

1612
01:52:06,261 --> 01:52:07,761
Fuck that!

1613
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:17,771
You say you're sorry,
or I'm gonna make you
fucking sorry.

1614
01:52:18,231 --> 01:52:19,690
Oh, Jesus.

1615
01:52:20,316 --> 01:52:23,110
I'll bet you even called us
"beavers" on your CB radio,
didn't you?

1616
01:52:23,319 --> 01:52:24,987
Yeah. Sure did!

1617
01:52:25,655 --> 01:52:28,907

I hate being called
a beaver, don't you?

1618
01:52:28,992 --> 01:52:30,200

apologize or what?

you bitch!

1622

I don't think he is
gonna apologize.

1623
01:52:50,555 --> 01:52:51,889
Nah, I don't think so.

1624

God damn it!

1626

to pay for this!

to pay for that!

1628

01:57:15,319 --> 01:57:17,404
<i>of green Thunderbird.</i>
<i>Requesting assistance.</i>

1669
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:22,075
Shit.

1670
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:28,957
We have
the suspects in sight.
Continuing pursuit.

1671
01:57:34,756 --> 01:57:35,756
Remain in position!

1672
01:57:42,638 --> 01:57:44,598
I know this whole thing
was my fault. I know it.

1673
01:57:44,682 --> 01:57:46,600
Damn it, Thelma,
if there's one thing
you should know by now,

1674
01:57:46,684 --> 01:57:47,684
this wasn't your fault!

1675
01:57:49,145 --> 01:57:52,814
Louise,
no matter what happens,
I'm glad I came with you.

1676
01:57:53,649 --> 01:57:54,775
Shit.

1677
01:58:00,948 --> 01:58:02,657
Oh, shit.

1678
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:08,497
Did you see that guy?
He was right in
the middle of the road!

1679
01:58:22,553 --> 01:58:24,012
Hold on!

1680
01:58:47,036 --> 01:58:49,079
I guess everything
from here on in is
gonna be pretty shitty.

1681
01:58:49,163 --> 01:58:50,580
Unbearable, I'd imagine.

1682
01:58:50,665 --> 01:58:52,624
Look, everything
we got to lose
is already gone anyway.

1683
01:58:52,708 --> 01:58:54,334
Oh, God. How do you
stay so positive?

1684
01:59:07,181 --> 01:59:09,474
Come on, let's go!

1685
02:00:00,026 --> 02:00:01,276
You're a good friend.

1686
02:00:01,777 --> 02:00:02,944
You, too, sweetie,
the best.

1687
02:00:06,073 --> 02:00:08,450
How do you like
the vacation so far?

1688
02:00:13,873 --> 02:00:15,790
I guess I went
a little crazy, huh?

1689
02:00:16,542 --> 02:00:18,627
No, you've always
been crazy.

1690
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:20,295
This is just the first
chance you've ever had

1691
02:00:20,379 --> 02:00:21,504
to really express yourself.

1692
02:00:27,470 --> 02:00:28,470
Good driving.

1693
02:00:31,432 --> 02:00:32,641
Thanks.

1694
02:01:44,964 --> 02:01:46,881
Oh, my God.

1695
02:01:47,883 --> 02:01:49,134
What in the hell is this?

1696
02:01:50,553 --> 02:01:51,928
I don't know.
I think...

1697
02:01:52,805 --> 02:01:55,015
I think it's the goddamn
Grand Canyon.

1698
02:01:57,601 --> 02:01:59,227
Isn't it beautiful?

1699
02:02:00,271 --> 02:02:03,648
Yeah. It's something
else, all right.

1700
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:10,256
Oh, my God.

1701
02:03:10,966 --> 02:03:11,966
It looks like the Army.

1702
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:13,259
All this for us?

1703
02:03:13,761 --> 02:03:16,221
Hey, don't let them
shoot those girls!

1704
02:03:17,139 --> 02:03:19,349
This is too much.
They got guns
pointing at them!

1705
02:03:19,433 --> 02:03:21,810
These women are armed,
Hal. This is standard.

1706
02:03:21,894 --> 02:03:24,187
Now, calm down.
These boys know
what they're doing.

1707
02:03:25,898 --> 02:03:28,191
<i>Place your hands</i>
<i>in plain view.</i>

1708
02:03:28,275 --> 02:03:30,902
<i>Any failure to obey</i>
<i>that command</i>

1709
02:03:30,986 --> 02:03:34,656
<i>will be considered</i>
<i>an act of aggression</i>
<i>against us.</i>

1710
02:03:37,910 --> 02:03:41,162
<i>I repeat,</i>
<i>turn your engine off</i>

1711
02:03:41,247 --> 02:03:43,706
<i>and place your hands</i>
<i>in plain view.</i>

1712
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:49,879
What are you doing?

1713
02:03:50,840 --> 02:03:52,090
I'm not giving up.

1714
02:03:52,508 --> 02:03:55,969
Max, you gotta do something!
How many times, Max?

1715
02:03:56,053 --> 02:03:58,471
How many times
has that woman got
to be fucked over?

1716
02:03:58,556 --> 02:04:02,016
Hey, listen! Will you
pull yourself together?
Now, listen to me!

1717
02:04:02,101 --> 02:04:04,185
You calm down.
Don't make me
sorry I brought you.

1718
02:04:04,520 --> 02:04:05,645
Damn it!

1719
02:04:05,729 --> 02:04:06,855
I repeat,

1720
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:11,568
<i>cut your engine off</i>
<i>and place your hands</i>
<i>in plain view!</i>

1721
02:04:18,451 --> 02:04:21,494
Okay, then, listen.
Let's not get caught.

1722
02:04:23,247 --> 02:04:24,414
What are you
talking about?

1723
02:04:27,376 --> 02:04:28,585
Let's keep going.

1724
02:04:30,087 --> 02:04:31,171
What do you mean?

1725
02:04:35,176 --> 02:04:36,217
Go!

1726
02:04:42,057 --> 02:04:43,183
You sure?

1727
02:04:46,061 --> 02:04:49,272
Yeah.

1728
02:05:05,539 --> 02:05:06,539
Hey!

1729
02:06:32,918 --> 02:06:37,672
<i>I felt it when the sun</i>
<i>came up this morning</i>

1730
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:44,929
<i>I knew that I could not</i>
<i>wait another day</i>

1731
02:06:47,933 --> 02:06:52,937
<i>Darling, there is something</i>
<i>I must tell you</i>

1732
02:06:55,649 --> 02:06:59,902
<i>A distant voice</i>
<i>is calling me away</i>

1733
02:07:02,865 --> 02:07:07,827
<i>Until we find the bridge</i>
<i>across forever</i>

1734
02:07:10,539 --> 02:07:14,792
<i>Until this grand illusion</i>
<i>brings us home</i>

1735
02:07:18,130 --> 02:07:22,884
<i>You and I will</i>
<i>always be together</i>

1736
02:07:25,304 --> 02:07:30,058
<i>From this day on</i>
<i>you'll never walk alone</i>

1737
02:07:33,312 --> 02:07:36,064
<i>You're a part of me</i>

1738
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:39,567
<i>I'm a part of you</i>

1739
02:07:40,527 --> 02:07:43,571
<i>Wherever we may travel</i>

1740
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:47,033
<i>Whatever we go through</i>

1741
02:07:48,077 --> 02:07:51,746
<i>Whatever time may take away</i>

1742
02:07:52,081 --> 02:07:55,416
<i>It cannot change</i>
<i>the way we feel today</i>

1743
02:07:55,918 --> 02:08:00,171
<i>So hold me close</i>
<i>and say you feel it too</i>

1744
02:08:03,175 --> 02:08:07,845
<i>You're a part of me</i>
<i>and I'm a part of you</i>

1745
02:08:14,144 --> 02:08:19,232
<i>I can hear it</i>
<i>when I stand</i>
<i>beside the river</i>

1746
02:08:21,860 --> 02:08:26,572
<i>I can see it</i>
<i>when I look up</i>
<i>in the sky</i>

1747
02:08:29,410 --> 02:08:35,123
<i>I can feel it when I hear</i>
<i>that lonesome highway</i>

1748
02:08:37,167 --> 02:08:41,754
<i>So many miles</i>
<i>to go before I die</i>

1749
02:08:44,967 --> 02:08:49,470
<i>We can never know</i>
<i>about tomorrow</i>

1750
02:08:52,349 --> 02:08:56,978
<i>Still we have to choose</i>
<i>which way to go</i>

1751
02:08:59,982 --> 02:09:04,819
<i>You and I are standing</i>
<i>at the crossroads</i>

1752
02:09:07,656 --> 02:09:12,660
<i>Darling, there is one thing</i>
<i>you should know</i>

1753
02:09:15,164 --> 02:09:17,331
<i>You're a part of me</i>

1754
02:09:18,876 --> 02:09:21,502
<i>I'm a part of you</i>

1755
02:09:22,463 --> 02:09:25,214
<i>Wherever we may travel</i>
