1
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,230
Fire department Is anyone home?

2
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,238
Wait outside, please.

3
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,038
Whats the date on the mail?

4
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,069
The 9th.

5
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,553
The door's open.

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,310
They had a nurse
but I haven't seen her recently.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,068
- Are you the one who opened the windows?
- No

8
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,432
Welcome to the
Theatre des Champs-Elysées.

9
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,751
Please kindly turn off your mobile phones

10
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:21,158
and we remind you
that audio orvideo tap ng is forbidden.

11
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,829
We wish you a wonderful show.

12
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,679
They used a screwdriver or something.

13
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,911
It doesn't look very professional.

14
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,753
- Who'd do a thing like that?
- I've no idea.

15
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,356
Why does anyone try to break in?
To steal something.

16
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,475
From us?

17
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,635
Why not?

18
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:39,278
If I tried, I could think of three or four people
we know who've been burgled.

19
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,436
Can't we call the concierge?

20
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,559
In the morning.
Don't et this spoil your good mood.

21
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,994
Orthe police?

22
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,071
Come on give me your coat.

23
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:04,390
Imag ne if we're in bed
and someone bursts in.

24
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,148
Why should I imagine such a thing?

25
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:10,232
It's horrible. I think I'd die of fright.

26
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,839
Me too.

27
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,833
Another drink?

28
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,672
I'm tired.

29
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,515
I feel like another drink.

30
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,632
Do as you wish.

31
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,869
Mathilde said that in her building,

32
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,316
the top-storey flat was burgled via the attic.

33
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,311
They made a hole in the wall,

34
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,155
cut the most valuable paintings
out of their frames

35
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,676
and disappeared wthout a trace.

36
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,194
That's a professional job.

37
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,112
Did I mention
you looked very pretty tonight?

38
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,031
What's come overyou?

39
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,988
Incredible semiquavers in the presto.

40
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,474
Such finesse!

41
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,152
Don't you think?

42
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,433
He did you proud?

43
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,479
What's wrong?

44
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,834
Nothing.

45
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,472
And next week?

46
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,192
No, but I'd like it fixed as soon as possible.

47
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,234
It might give other people ideas

48
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,477
and it looks pretty awful.

49
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,479
At what time?

50
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,909
Yes.

51
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,189
OK.

52
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,954
Will you bring varnish for the door?

53
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,191
A little primer, at least.

54
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,878
OK, fine.

55
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,148
Yes.

56
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,916
OK, thanks. Goodbye.

57
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,313
We can rely on him.

58
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,748
Let's hope so.

59
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,389
Last time, he kept us waiting,

60
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,715
if you remember.

61
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,996
Yes, he did. Thanks.

62
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,753
If I call a contractor though,
we'll wait at least two months.

63
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,235
You think?

64
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,398
The Frodons waited three days
when their toilet was blocked.

65
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,637
Not exacty pleasant.

66
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,917
The saltcellar's empty.

67
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,916
I don't know if he'll br ng the CD today.

68
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,591
Perhaps he won't come at all.

69
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,953
We could go to Virgin this afternoon

70
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,479
and buy it.

71
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,354
What do you say?

72
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,599
What's going on?

73
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,348
What's wrong?

74
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,475
Anne!

75
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,829
It's me.

76
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,435
Anne?

77
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,753
What's going on?

78
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,759
What's wrong?

79
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,991
Sweetheart, please...

80
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,233
Anne, look at me.

81
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,231
What's wrong?

82
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,829
What are you doing?

83
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,477
You had left the water running.

84
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,830
Whats going on? Are you completely mad?

85
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,679
Is this a joke?

86
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,749
Sorry?

87
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,678
Is this some kind of prank?

88
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,756
Are you playing a prank on me?

89
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,308
What prank? I dont understand.

90
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,273
Why that tone of voice?
What's gotten into you?

91
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,669
Stop playing games, Anne. Its not funny.

92
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,519
What game forgoodness' sake?
What's going on?

93
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,792
Why didn't you react?

94
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,035
To what?

95
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,599
To anything, to me...

96
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,870
- When?
- Just a moment ago.

97
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,199
Please tell me what's wrong.

98
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,038
I don't know what to say.

99
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,954
Are you sure you don't remember
what just happened?

100
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,029
What just happened?

101
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,676
You were sitting there

102
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,478
starting into space

103
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,552
and you didn't answer
when I asked what was going on.

104
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,512
I used this dish-cloth to dab your face
and you didn't react

105
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,399
Look, there are stil stains on your collar.

106
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,989
When was this?

107
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,833
Just now, two minutes ago.

108
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:55,715
And?

109
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,399
Don't give me "And?"

110
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,989
I went to the bedroom to get dressed

111
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,878
and go get some help.

112
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,439
- Help?
- Yes

113
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,911
Then you turned off the tap.

114
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,715
Yes, because you'd left the water running.

115
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,239
I don't understand.

116
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,953
Neither do I.

117
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,077
I should call Dr. Bertier.

118
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,519
Why? What can he do?

119
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,953
I don't know. Examine you.

120
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,395
I'm fine. Nothing's wrong with me.

121
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,751
Listen, Anne,

122
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,555
this is absurd.
We can't pretend nothing happened.

123
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,279
But what happened in actual fact?

124
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:40,119
I'm here, having my breakfast

125
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,033
and you're telling me things
I don't understand.

126
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,757
Can you explain how the dishcloth got here?

127
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,955
No.

128
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,953
- Who turned the tap on?
- You.

129
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,158
So you remember?

130
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,309
No.

131
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,472
You're trying to torture me.

132
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,798
Leave me a one!

133
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,909
Wouldn't it be better to call Dr Bertier?

134
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,115
No.

135
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,717
You know him.
He always has to see an idea through.

136
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,035
In the end, everybody was happy.

137
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,556
And it's a boost for ourfnances.

138
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,029
Were performing till the 28th,
then we break for 10 days,

139
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,231
then to Stockholm for four days,

140
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,834
then on to Kuhmo in Finland,

141
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,514
whereverthat is.

142
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,954
In the North Pole.

143
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,229
Geoff's been there before and oves it.

144
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,234
There, we'll play arrangements of Dowland.

145
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,230
And then t's back to London.

146
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,313
And the children?

147
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,919
Liz is at her boarding school and John...

148
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,075
He's doing his thing. He's 26.

149
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,592
Whats he doing now?

150
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,074
He works.

151
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,159
He's very independent.

152
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,832
We hardly ever see him.

153
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,592
A bit like Geoff.

154
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,035
They don't get along well.

155
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,229
Geoff's always trying to give him advice

156
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,398
and that annoys John.

157
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,034
Is he good?

158
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,954
I think so.

159
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,357
He's less impulsive

160
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,113
but conscentious.

161
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,792
That sounds almost pejorative.

162
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,235
Not at all. He's different than Geoff.

163
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,949
He's...

164
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,471
Calm but persevering.

165
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,631
I can see him making it.

166
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:31,194
The other day, he played the solo part

167
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,597
In Haydn's concerto
at the last Conservatory concert.

168
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,954
It was very good.

169
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,032
Geoff was there
and congratulated him at the end.

170
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,949
What about you?

171
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,149
What about me?

172
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,117
Have you reconciled?

173
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,833
You know what he's like.

174
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,669
In September,
he suddenly fell in love with a viola player

175
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,229
who'd been in our ensemble for years.

176
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,234
What can I say? It caused a huge drama.

177
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,351
She tried to kill herself.

178
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,954
He got scared and came back to me

179
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,473
riddled with remorse.

180
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,914
Over the years, I've got used to it.

181
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,193
What bothers me is that
the whole ensemble knows.

182
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,189
Do you love him?

183
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,033
Yes, I think so.

184
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,317
What was this operation for?

185
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,270
What do you want me to say?

186
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:51,473
They ran tests that revealed
an obstruction of the carotid

187
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,152
which required an operation.

188
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,392
She was frightened.

189
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,838
She was confused and frightened.

190
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,152
Shes always been scared of doctors,
you know

191
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,552
They said the surgical risks were very low

192
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,231
and that without an operation,
she'd have a more serious attack.

193
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,070
What do they say now?

194
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,558
That it didn't work.

195
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,754
That's all.

196
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,600
The 5% failure rate.

197
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,355
It's all terribly exciting.

198
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,353
Normaly, at this time, I'm asleep.

199
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,592
My blood sugar evel

200
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,512
is subterranean.

201
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,511
I'm really sorry.

202
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,755
Yes.

203
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,439
What can I do to help?

204
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,749
Nothing.

205
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,432
It's sweet of you to have come
with all the stress you have.

206
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,870
Seriously, you can t do anything.

207
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,439
We'll see what happens
when she comes back home.

208
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,312
We'll manage all right.

209
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:22,119
Perhaps I'll hire a nurse

210
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,472
or maybe I can care for her myself.

211
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,629
We'll see.

212
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:31,477
Weve always coped, your mother and I.

213
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,160
All this is stll a bit new.

214
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,309
It's funny.

215
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,470
Sorry if this embarrasses you,

216
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,312
but when I came in earlier,

217
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,314
I remembered listening to you two
making love when I was little.

218
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,592
For me it was reassuring.

219
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,996
It made me feel you loved each other

220
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,833
and that we'd always be together.

221
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,638
Mind your fingers.

222
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,880
Put those down near the window.

223
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,389
Sorry.

224
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,989
- For both of you.
- Thanks you

225
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,229
Goodbye then.

226
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,355
Thank you, Mr. Mery.

227
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,830
If you need anything just call down.

228
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,228
If we can help...

229
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,235
Everything's fine for now,
but I'll call your wife if we need help.

230
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,914
Were glad to have you back, Mrs. Laurent.

231
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,036
Yes, thanks you, Mr. Mery.

232
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,831
If you need anything...

233
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,228
Yes. Thank you.

234
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,229
Goodbye Madam.

235
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,431
And once again, we come home.

236
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,909
Goodbye, Sir.

237
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,190
Goodbye Mr.Mery. Thank you.

238
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,518
Where do you want to...

239
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,593
The living room.

240
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,232
Shall I make some tea?

241
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,914
Come and sit with me first.

242
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,597
Could you help me into the chair?

243
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,193
Yes, of course.

244
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,799
Come as close as you can,

245
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,590
put your knees against mine so I don't slip,

246
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:07,034
wrap your right arm around me

247
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,636
and lift me up.

248
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:03,074
I'm so happy that you're back.

249
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,873
Me too.

250
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,599
Promise me something.

251
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,715
What?

252
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,032
Please dont evertake me
back to the hospital.

253
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,109
What?

254
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,352
Do you promise?

255
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,270
- Anne...
- Do you promise?

256
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:36,034
Don't speak.

257
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,439
Don't explain.

258
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,589
Please.

259
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,032
What can I say?

260
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,475
Nothing.

261
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,392
Say nothing.

262
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,435
OK?

263
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,959
Thanks.

264
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,118
Thanks, Sweetheart.

265
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,828
Everything OK?

266
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,479
Everything's OK.

267
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,753
You don't have to hold my hand all the time.

268
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,520
I can look after myself, you know.

269
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,352
And don't feel guilty.

270
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,988
It would be absurd and oppressive.

271
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,639
For me too.

272
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,158
I don't feel guilty.

273
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,469
Good.

274
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,592
Go back in there now.

275
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,991
I'm not a cripple.

276
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,639
You can leave me alone for a minute.
I won't fall to pieces.

277
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,839
OK.

278
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,031
Did you buy the new book on Harnoncourt?

279
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,474
I've already read it.

280
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,709
And?

281
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,189
You want it? I'll get it for you.

282
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,714
Please.

283
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,231
I don't know where I put it.

284
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,631
It doesn't matter. It's not important.

285
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,028
It does matter.

286
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,915
Hold on...

287
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,515
I think I left it...

288
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,914
Here it is!

289
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,393
There's nothing keannfalible memory.

290
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,433
I thought I'd left it in the spare room,

291
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,595
when in fact I'd a ready put it away.

292
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,990
Tidy is as tidy does.

293
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,749
Thank you.

294
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,669
Right...

295
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,876
Now find yourself something to do.

296
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,597
Don't stand there to see how I hold the book.

297
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,829
OK?

298
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,109
OK.

299
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,271
I'll leave the dooropen.

300
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,354
Unfortunately
the strawberres were a ready mushy

301
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:36,669
but I'll get you some fresh ones
at the market tomorrow.

302
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,678
My husband will bring up the Evian later.

303
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,509
It's too heavy for me, with my back.

304
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,948
No problem.

305
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,439
It was 7640 euros.

306
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,631
Here's the receipt

307
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,199
and 23.60 back.

308
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,396
No, keep the change.

309
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,198
Thank you, Sir.

310
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,357
Right I'll be going.

311
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,556
Call me if you need anything.

312
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,709
I will.

313
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,879
Is yourwife feeling better?

314
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,469
Yes, she's recovering.

315
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,709
Good.

316
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,717
Give her my regards.

317
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,753
My husband and I are glad to have her back.

318
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,229
Yes, we are too.

319
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,232
Goodbye Mrs. Mery. Thank you.

320
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,753
Goodbye, Sir.

321
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,832
I'll bring you the strawberries
tomorrow noon if thats OK.

322
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,911
That's fine thank you.

323
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,272
Can you come please?

324
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,395
Yes.

325
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,552
A schmaltzy romance

326
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,713
between a nobleman
and a commoner's daughter

327
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,030
who can't marry and so,

328
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,391
through generosity of spirit,
they renounce each other.

329
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,791
Actualy, I'm not sure of the story any more.

330
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,395
I remember being overcome with emotion
when I came out of the film

331
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,990
and it took me a while to calm down.

332
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,229
Thanks you.

333
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,753
In the courtyard of Grandma's building,

334
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,152
there was a young man at his window
who asked me where I'd been.

335
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,915
He was a few years older than me,
one of those flashy types

336
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,992
and of course he intimidated me.

337
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,071
"At the cinema," I had said.

338
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,910
Because I was very proud that Grandma
had given me the money to go a one.

339
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,271
"What did you see?"

340
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,590
I started telling him the story

341
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,273
and, as I did so,
the emotion bubbled up again.

342
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,953
I couldnt very well cry in front of him

343
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,511
but I couldn't help myself.

344
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,956
I stood there in tears in the courtyard

345
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,515
and told him the whole damn story.

346
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,554
And?

347
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,949
What did he do?

348
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,959
I've no idea.

349
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,111
He made fun of me, no doubt.

350
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,471
I don't remember.

351
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,791
I don't remember the film either.

352
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,473
But I remember

353
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,119
those emotions.

354
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,471
I was ashamed about crying

355
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,158
and yet, telling the story,
the emotions and tears welled up again,

356
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,312
even stronger than during the film perhaps.

357
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,271
I couldn't stop crying.

358
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,629
That's sweet.

359
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,752
Why didn't you ever tell me?

360
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,833
There are still many stories
I've nevertold you.

361
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,836
You're not going to ruin your image
in old age, are you?

362
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,991
I'd rather not.

363
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,353
What's my image?

364
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,991
You can be a monster sometmes

365
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,269
but you are kind.

366
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,271
Can I get you another drink?

367
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,193
Five,

368
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,678
six,

369
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,199
seven,

370
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,952
eight,

371
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,632
nine,

372
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,713
ten.

373
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,119
We'll do fifteen.

374
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,713
Eleven,

375
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,028
twelve,

376
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,959
thirteen,

377
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,879
fourteen,

378
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,073
and fifteen!

379
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,235
- OK?
- Yes, fine.

380
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,593
Listen.

381
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,399
My horoscope.

382
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,389
"Motto...

383
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,755
"Vivacious but serious.

384
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,435
"Love...

385
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,229
"Superior distractions are what you need.

"Work...

387

"Your motivation's back,

"Fitness...

00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,919
"Shake off the rust with a ttle exercise

00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,838
"to get your momentum back. "

391
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,749
You'll only have yourself to blame
you read that nonsense

392
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,953
Tomorrow afternoon's Pierres funeral.

393
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,439
You must go.

394
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,793
Yes, I think so.

395
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,191
But I really don't want to.

396
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,793
It's rare to want to attend a funeral.

397
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:55,793
I know some exceptions.

398
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,553
Annette can't wait to get dolled up.

399
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,315
- And that imbecle Francois...
- That's mean.

400
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,878
What would you say if no one came to yours?

401
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,391
Probably nothing.

402
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,399
Have you spoken

403
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,315
to Jeanne since I was taken to the hospital?

404
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,637
Does she know that I can't go?

405
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,829
Yes, of course.

406
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,388
What did she say?

407
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,988
She was shocked.

408
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,513
What do you mean?

409
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,955
I don't know.

410
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,674
What's anyone like when theyre shocked?

411
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,356
She was speechless she couldn't believe it.

412
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,149
I don't know.

413
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,430
I mean, not precisely.

414
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,274
You know I spoke to a lot of people.

415
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,675
I'm sorry.

416
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,997
I should be the one apologising.
I didn't mean it nastily.

417
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:02,515
But what's the point
constantly going on about it?

418
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,032
I constantly go on about it?

419
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,715
No.

420
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,948
I apologise.

421
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,955
What the...

422
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,909
How come you're home already?

423
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,759
What time is it?

424
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,069
Forgive me.

425
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,798
I was too slow.

426
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,598
Could you push me into the living room?

427
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,189
Yes.

428
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,953
You always were good at surprises.

429
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,755
Yes.

430
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,596
Why did you come back early?

431
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,320
I didn't come back eary. I caught a cab.

432
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,509
There's not much traffic on Saturdays.

433
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,189
True.

434
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,117
How was the funeral?

435
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,313
How did it go?

436
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,788
Tell me.

437
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,911
It was pretty strange.

438
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,755
The priest was an idiot.

439
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,394
A former co-worker of Pierre's

440
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:45,595
stood up and gave a terribly pathetic speech.

441
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,439
His old secretary brought a long
a tape player, a mini-tape player,

442
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:55,239
and put on Yesterday by The Beatles.

443
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,079
You can't imagine.

444
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,395
Everybody turned to look at her.

445
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,915
Apparently, it was unplanned.

446
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:06,115
Pierre's grandchildren were there.

447
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,512
Of course, they started giggling
when the music began.

448
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,235
And then,

449
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,558
the turn was placed on a huge gurney

450
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,429
that was clearly designed to carry a coffin

451
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,951
and out we went into the rain.

452
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,396
They placed the turn on a small electric cart

453
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,068
that crawled along for an eternity

454
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,879
until it reached the small hole theyd dug.

455
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,791
A lot of people were laughing hard.

456
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,311
It must have been awful for Jeanne.

457
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,119
There's no reason to go on iving.

458
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,435
I know it can only get worse.

459
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,596
Why must I inflict that on us?

460
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,112
On you and on me.

461
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,431
You're inflicting nothing on me.

462
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,313
You don't have to ie Georges.

463
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,310
Put yourself in my shoes.

464
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,989
Haven't you ever thought
it could happen to me, too?

465
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:18,519
Of course I have.

466
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,115
But imagination and reality
have very Itte in common.

467
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,838
It's improving every day.

468
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,598
I don't want to go on.

469
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,673
Everything you're doing
to make it bearable is touching

470
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:33,876
but I don't want to go on.

471
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,796
For my sake Not yours.

472
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,199
I don't believe you.

473
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,359
I know you.

474
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,508
You think you're a burden on me.

475
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:46,879
But if you were in my shoes,
what would you do?

476
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,035
I've no idea.

477
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:51,033
I don't want to think about what I'd do.

478
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,153
I'm tired.

479
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,199
I want to go to bed.

480
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:16,708
Hello there!

481
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,552
What a nice surprse!

482
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:22,759
Forgive the intrusion I tried calling
several times, but got no answer.

483
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,635
Sorry, I only pick up
when the number's in the memory

484
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,438
and I know who's calling.

485
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,794
Come on in.

486
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,078
I'm terribly sorry
I couldn't drop by after the concert.

487
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,548
I was so glad you could make it.

488
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,474
Come in.

489
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:42,230
Yesterday, my agent called me

490
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,391
because I'm making a record in June

491
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,317
and I had to choose a studio a piano...

492
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,832
So I caught the morning flight to Paris

493
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:55,392
and when I got to my hotel,
I decided to drop by

494
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:56,635
It's nearby.

495
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,988
It's nice of you.

496
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,238
These are for your wife.

497
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,509
Thanks you.

498
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:03,989
Is she in?

499
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:06,509
She is. I'll go and get her.

500
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,999
Please have a seat.

501
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:09,508
I hope this isn't a bad time?

502
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,511
Not at all. It's good to see you.

503
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:12,829
Have a seat.

504
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:19,358
We were so thrilled by your concert,
my wife and I.

505
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,519
We were looking forward
to seeing you again.

506
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,513
Can I get you something to drink?

507
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:28,030
- Tea?
- No, thank you.

508
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:33,715
I'll just put the flowers in water
and tell her that you're here.

509
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,513
I won't be a moment.

510
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,433
Alexandre!

511
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,114
How delightful It's overly to see you.

512
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,439
Mrs Laurent,

513
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,399
the pleasures mine.

514
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,754
Have a seat.

515
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:47,789
Go on have a seat

516
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,271
and don't look so a armed.

517
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,631
I'm extremely proud of you.

518
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,480
We were in raptures after your concert.

519
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:15,633
The very next morning
Georges said he wanted to buy your new CD.

520
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,153
Oh dear.

521
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:19,916
I meant to bring you one and totally forgot.

522
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:22,475
I left in such a haste.

523
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:26,593
- I'll try to find one today and...
- No, please.

524
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,309
Let us contribute to your success,

525
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,630
even fit's only 20 euros.

526
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,990
You've already made a great contribution.

527
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:36,835
I owe you a lot.

528
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,319
You owe it to your hard work and talent.

529
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,788
You rememberthe first time
you asked me to play Bagatelles?

530
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,509
I was 12.

531
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:54,632
With my youthful arrogance I asked,
'Why some Bagatelles?"

532
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,989
Remember?

533
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,668
You realy chewed me out that day.

534
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,151
What happened to you?

535
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,350
I'm paralysed down my right side.

536
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,351
It happens with age.

537
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:12,829
How?

538
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,509
Let's change the subject, shall we?

539
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,869
Sure.

540
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,199
Don't be offended,

541
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:23,195
but I want to make the most
of your lovely surprise visit.

542
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,992
Of course.

543
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:32,555
You still haven't told us all that's happened
since your concert in Paris.

544
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,512
I've been in London most of the time,

545
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,713
except two concerts in Copenhagen,

546
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,350
Schubert again
The Impromptus and Moments Musicaux.

547
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,554
My life revolves around Schubert right now.

548
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:50,710
Ideally I'd like to record a the sonatas.

549
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,759
But the last ones can wait a few years.

550
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,911
Will you do me a favour?

551
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,069
Yes.

552
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,878
Would you play the Bagatelle in G Minor?

553
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,917
I haven't played tin ages.

554
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,757
I'm not sure I remember it.

555
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:15,071
If you want, I can try but...

556
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,395
Try.

557
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,153
What's wrong?

558
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:00,313
What are you doing?

559
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:06,155
Have you lost your mind?

560
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,477
I don't believe it.

561
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,671
Look what you've done.

562
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:35,676
Can't you call me
when you need something?

563
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:38,316
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

564
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,319
Me too.

565
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,874
Sorry.

566
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,794
The amp's broken, too.

567
00:55:18,080 --> 00:55:19,069
Yes?

568
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,354
Who's there?

569
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,032
What's going on?

570
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,268
Who's it?

571
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,233
Is anyone there?

572
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,274
Georges? What's going on?

573
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,431
What's wrong?

574
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,279
Calm down.

575
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,678
What was it?

576
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:10,989
Eva.

577
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,672
They'I be here on the 12th.

578
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,478
How come?

579
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,318
Don't ask me.

580
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,359
Apparently, shes coming with Geoff.

581
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:23,633
When?

582
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,197
I don't know exactly Whats today s date?

583
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,159
I'll check.

584
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,472
I don't want that.

585
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,355
- What?
- For Geoff to come. It's not necessary.

586
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,034
I don't need any comments on my state.

587
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,870
His Brtsh humour
is bearable only in small doses.

588
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,957
"Dear Mrs Laurent and Mr Laurent,

00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,478
'I spent a beautiful
and sad moment with you.

00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,156
I hope with all my heart
that everything works out.

00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:34,278
With the deep affection

593
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,158
Turn the music off.

594
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,196
Where are the photo albums?

595
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,639
The photo albums?

596
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,074
I don't know.

597
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,551
In the spare room, I think.

598
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,069
Why?

599
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,231
Can you bring them?

600
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,319
Now?

601
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,832
Why now?

602
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,752
I'd like to look at them.

603
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,033
Please.

604
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:42,589
Thank you.

605
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:44,788
You're welcome.

606
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,518
It's beautiful.

607
01:02:55,160 --> 01:02:56,354
What?

608
01:02:56,680 --> 01:02:57,999
Life.

609
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,519
So long.

610
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,952
Long life.

611
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:18,677
Stop observing me.

612
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,031
I'm not observing you.

613
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:25,718
Of course you are.

614
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,634
I'm not that stupid just yet.

615
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:33,668
'... from the twin angles

You're soaking wet.

623
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:50,438
How come?

624
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:51,794
Hold on.

625
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:11,077
It's no big deal.

626
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:33,639
Come on.

627
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:50,078
Don't get annoyed.

628
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,119
Calm down.

629
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:00,753
Perhaps it's better to invest the money
in buildings to rent

630
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:06,436
If inflation takes off again
property is the safest option.

631
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,433
At the moment,

632
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,115
savings accounts pay 1.75%.

633
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:14,236
That's a good rate.

634
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:16,269
Four years ago,

635
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,952
Geoff bought some stock
with a little nest egg

636
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:22,473
and everything collapsed.

637
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:26,309
So now we're worred, obviously.

638
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:29,959
At the same time,

639
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,959
other people had the same idea.
House prices are booming.

640
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,471
Since I got back from Scandinavia,
I've become addicted to the classifieds.

641
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,188
We'll see.

642
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:01,152
It takes time. We'll find something eventually.

643
01:08:14,120 --> 01:08:15,678
I've...

644
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,359
Grandmother...

645
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,718
Woman with house...

646
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:28,235
Not...

647
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,669
House...

648
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,354
After...

649
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,199
Money...

650
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:50,312
I'm sorry, Mummy, I don't understand.

651
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,990
I don't understand what you're saying.

652
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,077
Right away...

653
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,395
That's all...

654
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:09,713
House sale...

655
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:17,709
Not...

656
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:20,272
In a snap...

657
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,392
So fast...

658
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,599
God its hard...

659
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,234
To say...

660
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,113
House sold...

661
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:48,113
Money gone...

662
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,158
Gone...

663
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,953
As well as...

664
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:01,593
The house...

665
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:08,279
What house?

666
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,675
The house...

667
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,279
As we I...

668
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,471
Grandmother...

669
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,790
Three tmes a week.

670
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,629
I have no experience with it.
We'll see if t's enough

671
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,439
How much is she asking?

672
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:55,553
It's paid by the hour.

673
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:57,959
We'll see.

674
01:10:59,000 --> 01:10:59,989
What about her?

675
01:11:01,280 --> 01:11:02,395
Anne?

676
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:05,359
It's hard to explain.

677
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,036
Sometimes it's as if
she's totaly unaware of herstate.

678
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:12,629
A moment ater, it's the opposite.

679
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,151
What does the doctor say?

680
01:11:21,400 --> 01:11:23,470
She's talking gibberish.

681
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,992
What's going on?

682
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:39,720
We can't leave her lying there like that.

683
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,195
She's unrecognisable. It's mad.

684
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,152
We can't do anything for now.

685
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:47,352
She's under treatment, she has medication.

686
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:50,715
There's nothing else we can do.

687
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:54,037
Nothing else we can do?
Why not hosp talise her?

688
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,271
She had a second stroke.

689
01:11:58,200 --> 01:11:59,679
Bertier examined her

690
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:03,674
and thanks we can spare her
the battery of routine hospital tests.

691
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,190
They wouldn't keep her anyway.

692
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,437
They'd send her to a hospice.

693
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,078
What they do there, we can do here.

694
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:17,269
She's not going into a home.

695
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:20,357
I promised her that.

696
01:12:21,560 --> 01:12:24,393
Don't you think you're taking on too much?

697
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:26,438
Do you have a better idea?

698
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:36,156
I can't believe that these days
there aren't more effective treatments.

699
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,795
Nothing's stopping you from finding out.

700
01:12:41,080 --> 01:12:44,914
I presume you understand
that I love your mother as much as you.

701
01:12:45,080 --> 01:12:47,719
So please don't treat me like a moron

702
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,071
who can't even do the sensible thing.

703
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:52,753
I didn't say that.

704
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,477
I simply wonder if this

705
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:57,152
is the best solution.

706
01:12:58,120 --> 01:12:59,917
How about a second opinion?

707
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:02,636
OK, stop it both of you.

708
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:06,271
Another doctor came by.
He agreed with Bertier.

709
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:09,956
Starting Monday, a nurse will come
three times a week.

710
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,314
Happy?

711
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:14,359
Can we talk about something else now?

712
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:19,354
Such as?

713
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:56,635
...behind the shoulder
and push on her buttocks.

714
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,836
Hold her like that with the elbow

715
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,672
and put the nappy on.

716
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:05,549
You have to push behind her.

717
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,073
Push hard.

718
01:14:07,720 --> 01:14:11,076
And then slowly back.

719
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:13,397
Stretch her leg out.

720
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,193
There we are.

721
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:21,079
Now can you grab the sheet? I'll help.

722
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:22,878
Pull...

723
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:26,909
Now, pull the nappy

724
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,718
like this.

725
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:31,192
That's right.

726
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,190
And now on our back again.

727
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,034
Put the nappy on
and attach it with the little straps.

728
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:52,674
Here you go, Sweetheart. I hope you'll like it.

729
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,514
I added a little peach juice.

730
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,351
It tastes quite good.

731
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:49,236
Come on, Sweetheart,
you only ate three mouthfuls.

732
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:51,589
Come on.

733
01:18:16,280 --> 01:18:17,599
Sorry.

734
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:50,959
Mummy...

735
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,477
At concert...

736
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,513
No dress.

737
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,189
No dress Mummy at the concert?

738
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,315
Hurts!

739
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:26,875
Hurts!

740
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:30,234
Let's do the other side.

741
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,629
Hurts!

742
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,476
We're done Let's rinse you off.

743
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,389
Is the temperature OK?

744
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,232
I'm going to top you forward.

745
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,311
Don't be scared, I'm here.

746
01:19:57,600 --> 01:19:58,749
Very good.

747
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,436
She could do 8:00-12:00
and I'd do 2:00-6:00 in the afternoon.

748
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,113
Or 300-700.

749
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:16,679
Let me think about it.

750
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,751
Shell need some notice.

751
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,559
Of course.
I'll let you know in the next few days.

752
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:22,755
Very well.

753
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,393
I'd better be going.

754
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,919
Thanks for the coffee.

755
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:29,354
My pleasure.

756
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,113
I'll see you out.

757
01:20:44,240 --> 01:20:45,878
Don't take it to heart.

758
01:20:46,040 --> 01:20:48,270
Generally they always say something.

759
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:51,113
She cou d just as easiy
be saying, "Mum, mum mum!"

760
01:20:51,320 --> 01:20:52,878
It's a reflex.

761
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,314
I know.

762
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,233
Goodbye, Sir.

763
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:02,437
I'd like to hire another nurse.

764
01:22:03,560 --> 01:22:05,835
They could work in shifts.

765
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:09,190
That would simplify things.

766
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,472
What do you think?

767
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,835
Hurts.

768
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,151
Would you put them in the kitchen?

769
01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:40,473
I'm home!

770
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:52,873
Thank you very much.

771
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:00,913
Can I do anything else Sir?

772
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,838
No, thanks you. You've been a big help.

773
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,514
It's nothing. Thanks you very much.

774
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:07,751
I'll call you if necessary.

775
01:23:07,960 --> 01:23:09,598
With pleasure, Sir.

776
01:23:10,600 --> 01:23:11,669
Goodbye.

777
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:16,951
May I make a remark?

778
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,189
Yes.

779
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:20,078
My wife and I...

780
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:23,950
We're very impressed
by the way you're coping.

781
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:25,909
Hats off to you.

782
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,918
That's very kind. Thank you.

783
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,549
See you soon.

784
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:35,871
- Give my regards to your wife.
- I certainly will.

785
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,880
Hello Eva, how are you?

786
01:23:50,240 --> 01:23:51,719
Were fine.

787
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:08,308
There you go.

788
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:17,072
You want to look your very best

789
01:25:17,720 --> 01:25:19,836
so everybody can admire you.

790
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:21,993
There.

791
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:24,909
You want a look?

792
01:25:25,080 --> 01:25:26,149
Hold on.

793
01:25:29,480 --> 01:25:30,913
Well?

794
01:25:32,200 --> 01:25:33,713
Isn't she beautiful?

795
01:26:18,760 --> 01:26:20,034
Get out!

796
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:48,992
Whatever you say, Sir.

797
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:53,994
I don't know if you realise,

798
01:26:54,400 --> 01:26:57,153
I gave up another job to work here.

799
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,674
You should've thought through
if you needed a second nurse.

800
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:05,276
Then, I had no idea
how incompetent you are.

801
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,475
What does that mean?

802
01:27:07,640 --> 01:27:10,996
I won't discuss t with you
and you wouldn't understand anyway.

803
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:13,831
Nobody has ever
complained about me before.

804
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,634
Good for you. How much do I owe you?

805
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,475
780 euros.

806
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:26,515
This has never happened to me.

807
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:31,715
Who do you think you are?
I've been doing this for years.

808
01:27:31,880 --> 01:27:33,996
I don't need you to teach me my job.

809
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,155
Do you have 20 euros?

810
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:46,474
- No.
- Take the 800 and leave.

811
01:27:52,720 --> 01:27:54,836
You're a mean old man.

812
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,669
I pity you.

813
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:04,076
I sincerely hope that one day somebody
treats you like you treat your patients

814
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:07,394
and that you have no way to defend yourself.

815
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:09,831
Now get out of my sight.

816
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,832
Get out Go.

817
01:28:14,920 --> 01:28:17,514
Fuck you, you old prick!

818
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,118
Open your mouth.

819
01:29:03,960 --> 01:29:05,029
Come on...

820
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,113
Open your mouth.

821
01:29:12,760 --> 01:29:14,239
Please!

822
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,913
Please...

823
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:29,719
Stop that.

824
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:32,151
If you don't drink, you'll die.

825
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:34,795
Is that what you want?

826
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,399
Please.

827
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:54,911
For Chrst's sake.

828
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,838
You can't force me to let you die of thirst.

829
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:06,355
If you keep this up,
Bertier will hospitalise you.

830
01:30:07,960 --> 01:30:10,520
They'll feed you artf cially there.

831
01:30:10,680 --> 01:30:12,193
Is that what you want?

832
01:30:15,360 --> 01:30:18,511
I promised to spare you that,
but I need your help.

833
01:30:20,720 --> 01:30:22,358
It's too much for me.

834
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:26,675
Come on, Anne.

835
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,795
Drink it now.

836
01:30:42,720 --> 01:30:44,312
There you go.

837
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,675
That's good.

838
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,079
Go on drink it!

839
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:22,919
I'm sorry.

840
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,274
Forgive me.

841
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:41,957
- Who's there?
- It's me.

842
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,195
Eva?

843
01:32:43,200 --> 01:32:44,269
Yes.

844
01:32:46,200 --> 01:32:47,428
Just a moment.

845
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:44,479
What was the problem?

846
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:46,916
Nothing, I was in the toilet.

847
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:49,999
No come in.

848
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:02,759
Why the surprise visit?

849
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:04,831
Whats going on with Mum?

850
01:34:05,240 --> 01:34:06,275
Nothing.

851
01:34:06,920 --> 01:34:08,433
Should something be?

852
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:13,751
Wont you sit down first?

853
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:22,439
How come you're in Paris?

854
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:26,229
What's going on with Mum?
Why dont you ever answerthe phone?

855
01:34:27,280 --> 01:34:31,353
Since we spoke, I've left four messages.
Why haven't you called me back?

856
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,109
I'm sorry, I don't sten to the messages.

857
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:38,109
Doesn't it occur to you that were concerned?

858
01:34:40,280 --> 01:34:42,714
Your concern is of no use to me.

859
01:34:43,320 --> 01:34:45,470
Don't take it personally.

860
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,471
I'm not crit cising you.

861
01:34:48,640 --> 01:34:51,438
I don't have time to deal with your concern.

862
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:52,629
Dad!

863
01:34:52,640 --> 01:34:55,279
No, let's stop this conversation.

864
01:34:56,480 --> 01:35:00,234
As was to be expected,
your mothers in a bad way.

865
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:05,389
Shes increasingly like a defenceless child.

866
01:35:06,160 --> 01:35:09,232
It's sad and humiliating for both her and me.

867
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:11,789
She doesn't want anyone to see her like this.

868
01:35:12,240 --> 01:35:15,949
When you both came last time,
she didn't want you here.

869
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:19,831
You two have your Ife and that's fine.
Leave us ours.

870
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,117
- OK?
- Dad, whats gotten into you?

871
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:27,356
Nothing I'm just surprised by your visit

872
01:35:27,520 --> 01:35:30,193
and it annoys me to see you breeze in here

873
01:35:30,360 --> 01:35:32,351
saying what's right.

874
01:35:32,920 --> 01:35:35,036
Who do you think you are?

875
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,752
Stay here please.

876
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:46,989
Please.

877
01:35:58,520 --> 01:35:59,714
Mum?

878
01:36:13,800 --> 01:36:15,358
Are you out of your mind?

879
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:19,189
- Sit down.
- I don't want to see What's going on here?

880
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,069
Nothings going on.
I just want to avoid unnecessary drama.

881
01:36:23,800 --> 01:36:27,031
I imagine your mother's asleep.
She sleeps all day.

882
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,873
She wakes up at night though.

883
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:33,474
If you insist, we'll look in on her later.

884
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,353
Now, come and sit down.

885
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:53,358
Every day, we do our speech exercises

886
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:56,398
or we sing together.

887
01:36:58,120 --> 01:37:00,839
I usually wake up around 5:00.

888
01:37:01,360 --> 01:37:03,669
At that time, she's not asleep yet.

889
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,956
We change her nappy.

890
01:37:06,360 --> 01:37:08,715
I put cream on herto avoid bed sores

891
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:15,119
and around 7:00, I try to conv nce her
to have something to eat and drink.

892
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:18,794
Sometimes I succeed sometimes I don t.

893
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:22,277
Sometimes she talks about her ch dhood

894
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,194
or she calls for help for hours on end.

895
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:29,791
Suddenly, she'll burst out aughing

896
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,473
or she'll start weeping.

897
01:37:36,720 --> 01:37:39,792
None of all that deserves to be shown.

898
01:37:44,160 --> 01:37:46,549
You can't ban me from seeing her.

899
01:37:49,960 --> 01:37:51,109
No.

900
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,479
It's me Mum.

901
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,070
Can I do anything foryou?

902
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,759
The tea's not very hot

903
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:49,792
but it warms you up.

904
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:02,919
Thanks.

905
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:20,628
It was silly of me to lock the door.

906
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,429
I'm sorry.

907
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,115
I was surprised.

908
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,672
I'm sorry.

909
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:31,799
What happens now?

910
01:41:34,040 --> 01:41:35,553
What happens?

911
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,670
The nurse comes three times a week.

912
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:44,715
Every two weeks,
Dr Bertierand the hairdresser come.

913
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,710
Is that what you wanted to know?

914
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:53,232
What happens now
is what's happened until now.

915
01:41:54,520 --> 01:41:58,638
It wll go steadily downhill
for a while and then one day it'll be over.

916
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:02,231
You can't go on ke th 's Dad.

917
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:03,833
- I cant?
- No.

918
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,072
What do you suggest?

919
01:42:06,840 --> 01:42:09,035
Can't we have a serious talk about it?

920
01:42:10,080 --> 01:42:12,594
What do you ca I a serious talk?

921
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:15,870
You want Mum to live with you?

922
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:20,229
You want to pack her off to a home?
Is that what you want?

923
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:23,589
Go on,

924
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:26,396
talk seriously with me.

925
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,111
Really long...

926
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,120
Yes, swinging back and forth.

927
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:44,512
Back Forth...

928
01:42:44,720 --> 01:42:45,789
You.

929
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,192
Very serious...

930
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:50,713
Like that...

931
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:54,439
Like that...

932
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:57,233
Serious...

933
01:42:57,960 --> 01:43:00,190
Yes, I was very uptight.

934
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:04,472
Yes... Uptight...

935
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,229
It was...

936
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,235
Nice.

937
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:31,834
Hurts!

938
01:43:54,760 --> 01:43:56,159
What's wrong?

939
01:43:56,840 --> 01:43:58,432
Where does it hurt?

940
01:44:03,280 --> 01:44:04,952
What's the matter?

941
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:06,828
Is it the nappy?

942
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:09,273
Is it full?

943
01:44:10,440 --> 01:44:11,475
No.

944
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:13,799
Where does it hurt?

945
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:21,029
It's all right.

946
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:24,199
I'm here.

947
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:29,833
Everything's all right.

948
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:35,628
Let's...

949
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,791
Shall I tell you a story?

950
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:44,313
But you have to stay quiet
because I can't talk too loudly.

951
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,831
It tires me out.

952
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:54,031
When I was very young...

953
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:57,752
Actually, I wasn't that young.

954
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:00,196
I think it was

955
01:45:01,240 --> 01:45:03,196
at the end of primary school.

956
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,516
So I must have been about ten.

957
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:11,599
Mum and Dad sent me to a summer camp.

958
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:16,710
They thought it'd do me good
to be wth children my age.

959
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,391
The camp was based in an old castle

960
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,957
in the middle of a forest in Auvergne I think.

961
01:45:28,120 --> 01:45:29,951
No, I can t remember.

962
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:34,593
In any case, it was the oppos te
of what I'd expected.

963
01:45:38,040 --> 01:45:40,270
We had to get up at 6:00 in the morning

964
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:42,630
to go fora swim in a lake.

965
01:45:42,800 --> 01:45:44,358
It was a little lake

966
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,039
near the castle

967
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:50,433
that was fed by an ice-cold mountain stream.

968
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:55,279
We had to run and jump into tin pairs.

969
01:45:57,320 --> 01:46:00,392
You know I was never very sporty.

970
01:46:01,880 --> 01:46:05,395
The whole programme was designed

971
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:09,633
to keep us on the move all day long.

972
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,995
It was probaby intended to

973
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,234
nip in the bud

974
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:21,797
any potentia pubescent impulses.

975
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:24,511
The food was the worst part.

976
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:28,956
The th rd day afterwe arrived,

977
01:46:29,120 --> 01:46:30,599
for lunch,

978
01:46:30,760 --> 01:46:32,990
we were g ven rce pudding.

979
01:46:33,120 --> 01:46:34,838
I hate rice pudding.

980
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:39,957
We were sitting at long tables

981
01:46:40,120 --> 01:46:42,315
in an immense hall.

982
01:46:42,320 --> 01:46:44,595
I didn't want to eat the stuff.

983
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:49,511
A counselor

984
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,159
sad to me

985
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:53,310
You're not leaving

986
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:55,632
until you finish your plate.

987
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:00,710
Afterthe meal, everybody got up and left

988
01:47:01,280 --> 01:47:03,191
and I was left alone

989
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:04,634
in tears.

990
01:47:07,200 --> 01:47:11,193
Mum and I had made a secret pact.

991
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,830
I was to write her every week.

992
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:17,313
I was to send her a postcard.

993
01:47:17,480 --> 01:47:20,552
If I was enjoying camp,

994
01:47:20,560 --> 01:47:23,472
I was to draw flowers on it

995
01:47:23,720 --> 01:47:24,869
and if I wasn't,

996
01:47:25,200 --> 01:47:26,519
stars.

997
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:28,839
She kept that card.

998
01:47:29,320 --> 01:47:30,389
It was

999
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:32,718
covered in stars.

1000
01:47:35,160 --> 01:47:39,039
Afterthree hours,
I was fnally allowed to leave.

1001
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:42,311
I went up to my room

1002
01:47:42,600 --> 01:47:44,033
and got into bed.

1003
01:47:44,840 --> 01:47:47,195
I was runn ng a feverof over40.

1004
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:49,319
It was diphtheria.

1005
01:47:50,600 --> 01:47:52,591
They took me

1006
01:47:53,680 --> 01:47:55,557
to the nearest hosp tal

1007
01:47:56,080 --> 01:47:58,514
where I was kept in isolation.

1008
01:47:58,920 --> 01:48:02,435
So when Mum came to see me

1009
01:48:03,040 --> 01:48:05,918
she could only wave to me through the glass.

1010
01:48:11,560 --> 01:48:14,279
Somewhere a ong the line, I ost the card.

1011
01:48:16,120 --> 01:48:17,599
It's a shame.

1012
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,072
I'm a most done.

1013
02:01:28,400 --> 02:01:30,550
You can put your shoes on f you want.

1014
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:41,194
Thank you.

1015
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,031
You're not taking a coat?
