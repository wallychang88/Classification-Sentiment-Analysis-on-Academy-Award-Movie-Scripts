Are you asking me out?

Yes.

How old are you?

34
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:46,649
You're not supposed to ask that.

35
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:50,444
You're not supposed to ask a girl
how old she is. Annoying.

36
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,989
You're right. It doesn't matter to me.

37
00:01:54,907 --> 00:01:56,951
How are you gonna pay for dinner?

38
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,079
If I say yes and we go on a date
for dinner, how are you gonna pay?

00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,706
- You say everything twice.

- I don't say everything twice.
- You do.

41
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,544
What is this "say everything twice"?

42
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,338
Come on. How are you gonna pay?

43
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:12,842
Do you go to the movies?

You're looking at Tony.

There's, like, a million kids
in that movie. I don't know a Tony.

48
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,148
I want you to have dinner with me,
not my work.

49
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,109
I'm not trying to brag, but you did ask
how I was gonna pay for dinner.

50
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:34,572
Mmm, you're such an actor.
You're such an actor.

- Two beds, two baths.
- Mm-mmm.

54
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:42,413
I've done three sketches
on the merv grifiin show.

55
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,873
- Did you see me on...
- All right.

56
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:47,168
Don't list your whole resume. It's braggy.
I'm not going on a date with you, man.

57
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,252
You're 15.

58
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,545
"Man."

00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:54,508
"Kid." how about that?

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,720
I'm not going on a date
with you, kid. You're 15.

62
00:02:57,803 --> 00:03:02,183
Don't call it a date. It's not a date.
Just come say hello.

63
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:03,309
I like the way you look.

They're working. Just come say hi.

73
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:28,084
[Alana] Just shut up.

00:03:29,502 --> 00:03:30,961
[Gary] I'll tell you what I'm doing.

75
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:34,882
I take my brother Greg to tastee-freez
around 6:30. He's in bed by 7:30.

76
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,802

00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:46,143
I slip around the corner
to tail o' the cock for my dinner.

00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,896
That's where I'll be.
I'm not trying to pressure you.

81
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,399
You are pressuring me. You are.
That's what you're doing.

82
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:54,243
If you wanna come and say hello,
if it's convenient within your plans,

- I'd love to see you.

Convenient within my plans?
Wait, you leave your brother alone?

- [Cindy] Should I get an autograph?
- Don't bother.

I've been right here the whole time.

I get this feeling
I was meant to know you, Alana.

100
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,651
You know I'm 25, right?

101
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,945
I could be your friend,
but I can't be your girlfriend.

102
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:40,698
- That's illegal.
- You give me hope.

103

- Is that bad?
- Stop that.

108
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,044
Turn your legs around. Not too down.
Look up, look up.

109
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:56,505
Uh, close your mouth just a little bit.

110

Just see a little bit of teeth.
Little bit of teeth. Go on, like a tiger.

And off it. Go on. Next. Next.

112

How have I never seen you before?
How have we never met?

113
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:07,892
Stop talking so much, slimy.

114
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,395
We'll see. I doubt it, but we'll see.

115
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,981
Now I gotta get back to work
and you have to get back to class.

116
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,734
Stop using time as an excuse, Alana.
Our roads took us here.

117
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:21,071
Stop sounding like a philosophy guy,
Albert Einstein. Maybe I'll see you later.

118
00:05:21,155 --> 00:05:22,907
I'm not gonna see you later.

119
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:30,789
Just get your chin up just a little bit
like that, darling.

[Chuckles] Chin up, chin up.

- You should start your own business.
- [Alana chuckles]

152

- I'm a showman. It's my calling.
- Ugh.

159
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,500
I don't know how to do anything else.
It's what I'm meant to do.

00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,094
Are you joking?

172
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,431
Well, no, I'm not.

173
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,057
That's a lot.

174
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:18,684
It gets complicated.

175
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:22,604
I'm sure. And all that math homework
you have to do after everything.

176
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:27,818
My mom's in Las Vegas right now
taking care of the hacienda hotel,

177
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,611
which leaves me back here.

178
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,488
We do PR for tail o' the cock
and chadney's.

179
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:33,133
- I like chadney's.
- You like chadney's?

180
00:09:33,157 --> 00:09:34,997
- [Chuckles] Yeah.
- Do you like Japanese food?

181
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,287
- I don't really know what that is.
- The mikado?

182
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:41,999
- I'm taking you to the mikado next time.
- Next time?

183
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,834
- Yeah.
- [Alana chuckles]

184
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:46,253
The food's magnificent.

185
00:09:49,757 --> 00:09:51,216
You're sweet, Gary.

186
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:59,475
You're gonna be rich in a mansion
by the time you're 16.

187
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:02,019
[Chuckles] I'm gonna be here,

188
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:05,606
taking photos of kids
for their yearbooks when I'm 30.

189
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:08,692
You're never gonna remember me.

190
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,029
I'm not gonna forget you.

191
00:10:13,489 --> 00:10:15,449
Just like you're not gonna forget me.

192
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,804
If I ask for your phone number,
would you give it to me?

193
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,890
Why should I give you my phone number?

194
00:10:40,516 --> 00:10:42,351
So I can call you. [Chuckles]

195
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,939
- I don't know, Gary.
- Why not?

196
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,399
How are you gonna remember it?

197
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:51,026
It's only seven numbers.

198
00:10:53,904 --> 00:10:55,322
[Sighs]

199
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,409
758-4686.

200
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,204
- 756-4686.
- You already got it wrong.

201
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:05,415
758-4686.

202
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,044
- All right, Don rickles.
- [Chuckles]

203
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,715
Don't call me all the time, okay?

204
00:11:14,716 --> 00:11:17,427
We're not boyfriend and girlfriend.
Remember that.

205
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,098
Well, you know.

206
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:23,976
I know.

207
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,651
[Chuckles]

208
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,284
[Alana] Hi, dad.

209
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,203
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What's up?

210
00:11:43,287 --> 00:11:44,288
What?

211
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,414
What's going on?

212
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,833
Nothing.

213
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:49,126
What time is it now?

214
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,377
10:00.

215
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,713
What'd you do?

216
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,516
I told you what I was gonna do
this morning.

217
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,717
- What?
- Go to dinner with Lisa.

218
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:57,801
- Lisa?
- Yeah.

219
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,219
Who the fuck is Lisa?

220
00:11:59,303 --> 00:12:00,971
Dad, you know Lisa.

221
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:04,308
- Lisa? I don't know Lisa.
- Yeah, she works with me at tiny toes.

222
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,184
- What?
- Yes.

223
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,062
[TV playing]

224
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:16,904
[Door shuts]

225
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,534
Where were you?
Why are you dressed like that?

226
00:12:22,618 --> 00:12:24,870
Were you on a date?
Looks like it was a long date.

227
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:26,371
[Sighs] Get out of my room, este.

228
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:27,497
[Door closes]

229
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,544
[Anita] "His name is Jerome i-i. Frick.

230
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:37,758
His friends know him simply as Jerry,
and his attractive young wife as mioko.

231
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,217
Their new restaurant mikado

232
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:42,387
is a delightful dinery
featuring foods of Japan

233
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:43,972
and it should be quite authentic,

234
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:47,559
for Jerry had a restaurant
some 15 years in Tokyo.

235
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:51,438
The entire staff,
with the exception of Jerry, is Japanese

236
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:56,735
and those "little doll" waitresses
are dressed fittingly in colorful kimonos.

237
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:59,488
Give it a try.
We think you'll be delighted."

238
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:02,449
Oh, that's wonderful, Anita.

239
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:03,533
Oh, fantastic.

240
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:06,328
Oh, of course. It's just wonderful.

241
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,704
- Thank you.
- [Anita] Of course.

242
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:10,958
Uh, do you think we should mention
something about the Serenity, though?

243
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,669
The, uh... the pleasant quiet?

244
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:16,380
Yes, and I wish that we had space
to include everything,

245
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:20,217
because it's such a beautiful restaurant,
but if we choose one thing...

246
00:13:21,593 --> 00:13:25,180
Right. Okay. Let's just...

247
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:29,559
[Thick Japanese accent]
Oh, mioko, how you think of this?

248
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,270
What you think of item for newspaper?

249
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:35,524
[Speaking Japanese]

250
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,159
Oh! Oh, yoko-San.

251
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:49,496
[Normal voice] I think the cuisine
is not mentioned.

252
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:51,748
She's wondering
if we mentioned the cuisine.

253
00:13:51,832 --> 00:13:53,000
Of... uh...

254
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,918
- The cuisine?
- [Jerry] Mm-hmm.

255
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,504
I think we did talk about that, didn't we?

256
00:13:57,587 --> 00:14:00,632
- I... I might... I have an earlier draft.
- [Papers rustling]

257
00:14:00,716 --> 00:14:02,175
[Anita clears throat]

258
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:07,055
Here it is. "There is a complete roster
of Japanese appetizers available

259
00:14:07,139 --> 00:14:09,516
while sipping American
or Japanese spirits.

260
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,227
For the daring, sashimi is offered.

261
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,022
But don't worry,
there are many American dishes too.

262
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:18,817
Mikado is for the gourmet
and the non-gourmet alike."

263
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:21,653
[Thick Japanese accent]
What you think of that?

264
00:14:21,737 --> 00:14:22,988
[Speaking Japanese]

265
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,262
[Normal voice] Much better talking about
the cuisine than the waitresses.

266
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:30,638
- Thank you.
- [Anita] Oh, fantastic.

267
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,164
- I will make a note of that.
- Sure.

268
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,459
That's what we'll send to the paper.

269
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,794
Thank you so much
for coming in to g and g agency.

270
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:40,714
Really appreciate it, Anita.
Thank you so much.

271
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:42,007
- Arigato.
- [Anita] Of course.

272
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,217
[Thick Japanese accent] Oh!

273
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,887
[Radio announcer] 7:20 with Charlie.

274
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:49,347
Ill make that call
to the girl selected by the computer...

275
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:55,437
I'm afraid you're gonna be upset with me.

276
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,690
I can't take you to New York
for the Jerry best show.

277
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,525
I have to go to Las Vegas.

278
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,445
- I'm not upset.
- No?

279
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,363
No. Why is that bad?

280
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,660
Well, you can't go to New York
without a parent or a guardian.

281
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,455
They're not gonna let you
do the press tour without a chaperone.

I beg your pardon?

292
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,118
Can I get you something else to drink?

293

That's my friend. Don't think about that.

Oh, man, are you kidding?

321
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:09,446
My mind's racing,
doing circles around that track.

322
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,491
Hello, boys.

00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:14,951

What's that? What is that? V?
Is that for vagina?

332
00:17:32,886 --> 00:17:35,096
Why are you doing that?
Why do people keep doing that?

333
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,431
It's peace and love, baby.

334
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,849
Aw, shut it, you little shit.

335
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,060

00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:44,740
What did you do?

683
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,076
Did you murder someone, huh?

684
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,412
What, do you have drugs on you?

685
00:38:51,246 --> 00:38:52,831
What did you do, Gary?

692
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:43,966
Hey, "soggy bottom" sounds like
someone shit their pants.

[Laughs]

- That's not good.
- I know.

696
00:39:52,057 --> 00:39:54,893
That's only funny to you guys.
But when someone wants to buy a bed,

697
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,939
they don't wanna think about shitting,
or shitty diapers, or shit in pants.

698
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,607
A bed's not just for sleeping, Alana.

699
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:05,028
Well, if it's not just for sleeping,
I think you mean it's for sex.

700
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,531
"Soggy bottom"
isn't making anyone hot or horny.

701
00:40:07,614 --> 00:40:10,534
- It doesn't make you hot?
- No.

[Mitch] ”everybody's talking about
waterbeds these days, right?

And it's with good reason,

704
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,961
because the waterbed
is the greatest thing to happen to sleep

705
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,644
since the invention of the innerspring."

706

and I wanna do anything for you.

But I just don't really think
these fit in my restaurant.

is strictly American.

I don't speak Japanese.

Gary, I wanna help,

797
00:44:53,483 --> 00:44:57,112
but can I help without putting these out
inside everywhere?

Oh, hey, Alana.

How do you know him?

807
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,853
He's in here all the time.
He's a friend of Jerry's.

808
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:30,979
Yeah.

809
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:32,522
He's cute for a little hustler.

810
00:45:34,566 --> 00:45:37,402
He's also really smart
and a good businessman.

811
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:38,528
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, he's asking all the time.

817
00:45:55,003 --> 00:45:57,339
Good. I'll pass the Baton off to you.

818
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:04,220
Okay, I'll see you later, frisbee.

819
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:07,098
Okay. Say hi to your sisters for me.

[Sighs]

821
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:19,402
[Alana] I could describe the sensation

822
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:24,157
as a soft, spongy, slow-motion trampoline
without the great bounce.

823
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,702
Sexier. Sexier. Make it sexier.

824
00:46:27,786 --> 00:46:31,039
[Ted on phone] There's no... I can't...
There is no floor model for me to fly?

825
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,332
No, but you can get the bed

826
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,685
and if you don't like it,
we can do a money-back guarantee.

827
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,829
Alana, you have to be sexier
or he's not gonna buy it.

828
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:39,148
- /'i/ give you a call back.
- Don't let him get off the phone.

829
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:40,590
What's your name?

830
00:46:40,674 --> 00:46:41,800
Uh, Ted

831
00:46:42,634 --> 00:46:44,469
- Ted.
- Yeah.

832
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,263
Ah, Ted, I love that name.

833
00:46:47,347 --> 00:46:48,556
Okay

834
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,559
- my name's Alana.
- Hi; Alana.

835
00:46:51,643 --> 00:46:53,561
Can I come and install the bed for you?

836
00:46:53,645 --> 00:46:54,646
What?

837
00:46:54,729 --> 00:46:57,899
I'd lay it down and show you how it works.

838
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:00,193
It moves in a similar way to the ocean,

839
00:47:01,403 --> 00:47:03,363
wet inside.

840
00:47:04,197 --> 00:47:07,659
And it takes some getting used to,
but once you're in there, ah, Ted,

841
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:11,162
I don't think you're gonna be
asking any questions.

842
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:13,289
Sounds like you just sold
a waterbed, Alana.

843
00:47:13,373 --> 00:47:15,500
Tell me, what time can you be over
with that bed?

844
00:47:15,583 --> 00:47:18,795
Oh, well. Eager. [Chuckles]

845
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:20,505
I have to wait until my work is done.

846
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:22,298
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

847
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:25,552
I have a mean, old boss
that makes me work all day.

848
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,097
Why don't you tell fat Bernie
you have work to do and get out of there?

849
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,058
Oh. Fat Bernie is so mean, Ted.

850
00:47:32,142 --> 00:47:33,143
Sounds like it.

851
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,437
He keeps me locked up inside.

852
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:37,856
But you know what, Ted?

853
00:47:37,939 --> 00:47:39,065
What's that?

854
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:43,153
I know you're gonna love our wet beds.

855
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,715
- You know what they come with?
- What's that?

856
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,323
A wood headboard.

857
00:47:47,407 --> 00:47:51,828
And that wood is strong
and sticks straight up against the wall.

858
00:47:51,911 --> 00:47:52,912
That sounds great.

859
00:47:52,996 --> 00:47:54,956
We don't have wood headboards.

860
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,083
I'm gonna hand you off
to my associate kirk

861
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:59,252
and he's gonna take down
all your information

862
00:47:59,335 --> 00:48:01,421
and I'm gonna be at your place later, Ted.

863
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:04,049
Thank you for calling fat Bernie's.
Have a nice day.

864
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,925
What are you doing? We don't have beds.

865
00:48:06,009 --> 00:48:09,220
Well, we better get some, because water
in a plastic bag is a water balloon.

866
00:48:09,304 --> 00:48:11,585
With a frame, it's a bed.
Let's go to northridge lumber...

867
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:13,641
I wrote good dialogue.
You're improvising too much.

868
00:48:13,725 --> 00:48:15,045
You told me to make it more sexy.

869
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:16,394
I told you to make it more sexy.

870
00:48:16,478 --> 00:48:19,081
I didn't tell you, "go over
to the guy's house and get in his bed."

871
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,691
I told you I'm a good actress,
Gary. I told you.

872
00:48:21,775 --> 00:48:23,485
Don't tell me to make it more sexy, man.

873
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:26,446
If you want it more sexy,
I'll make it fucking horny.

874
00:48:26,529 --> 00:48:31,493
J” oh, woman, / can feel your warm face j”

875
00:48:32,869 --> 00:48:36,039
so, just say yes.
To whatever she asks you, just say yes.

876
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:38,625
Let's say, if she asks you
if you can sing, say yes.

877
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,228
If she asks if you can dance, say yes.

878
00:48:40,293 --> 00:48:41,503
I can sing, and I can dance.

879
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,546
No, I know. I know. I know.

880
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,883
I'm just saying that if she asks you
if you can do something

881
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:49,302
that you might not know how to do,
just say yes.

882
00:48:49,385 --> 00:48:51,265
Because you can always learn
how to do something

883
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:52,555
once you get the part.

884
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:56,601
So just say yes to whatever she asks.

885
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,478
Whatever she asks, just say yes.

886
00:48:58,561 --> 00:48:59,938
- Just say yes.
- Okay, I got it.

887
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:02,148
Okay. Hi, Janice.

888
00:49:02,232 --> 00:49:03,358
[Janice] Hi, Gary.

889
00:49:04,234 --> 00:49:06,402
- [Gary] Mary.
- Oh, darling.

890
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:13,118
80, Gary tells me
that you've been studying

891
00:49:13,201 --> 00:49:15,495
at everywoman's village
with Milton farmer.

892
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,746
[Alana] Yes.

893
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:21,126
I love his work with young actors.
He is a miracle worker.

894
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,335
[Alana chuckles]

895
00:49:26,548 --> 00:49:28,091
You have a warm smile,

896
00:49:29,384 --> 00:49:32,595
which is very powerful.

897
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:37,559
And you have a very Jewish nose...

898
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:41,855
[Laughs] ...Which is becoming
very fashionable.

899
00:49:41,938 --> 00:49:45,191
I am getting a lot more requests
for Jewish girls.

900
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,111
[Alana] Really? That's great.

901
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:50,572
[Phone rings]

902
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:12,260
[Laughing] No.

903
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:18,141
Love to Tatum.

904
00:50:19,809 --> 00:50:20,810
Are you athletic?

905
00:50:21,394 --> 00:50:22,896
You seem to have a very firm body.

906
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:24,022
Yes.

907
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,608
Do you know how to horseback-ride?

908
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,026
Yes.

909
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:30,445
Uh, do you know how to do fencing?

910
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:31,529
Yes, I can fence.

911
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:35,158
- Basketball?
- [Alana] Yes.

912
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:36,492
- Baseball?
- [Alana] Yes.

913
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,869
- Soccer?
- [Alana] Yes.

914
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:43,666
Any other sports or special skills
that I should know about?

915
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:46,711
I studied krav maga.

916
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,463
[Scribbling]

917
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,341
Well, I don't know what that is.
What is quick draw ll/lcgravi/p

918
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,969
[Alana] It's martial arts from Israel.
It's used in combat.

919
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:57,847
My dad was in the Israeli army.
We all know it. [Chuckles]

920
00:50:59,891 --> 00:51:03,937
So it's a form of karate, let's say.

921
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:08,107
It's more like, "how to use a pen
to stab someone's eye out."

922
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:14,405
You're a goddamn fucking fighter,
aren't you?

923
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:15,698
I like that.

924
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:18,701
I can see that.

925
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:24,290
You come here
trying to be all pretty for me,

926
00:51:24,374 --> 00:51:26,459
but really, you remind me...

927
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:30,838
Of a dog.

928
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,634
Of an English pit bull dog...

929
00:51:36,552 --> 00:51:40,515
With sex appeal and...

930
00:51:42,517 --> 00:51:45,186
A very Jewish nose. [Laughs]

931
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:46,729
[Laughing]

932
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:51,609
Uh, do you know any other languages,
besides English?

933
00:51:51,693 --> 00:51:52,735
Hebrew.

934
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,529
Besides Hebrew.

935
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:57,824
[Alana] Oh, I'm so sorry. Um, Spanish.

936
00:51:58,408 --> 00:51:59,534
[Mary] Oh.

937
00:52:00,285 --> 00:52:01,995
- French.
- [Mary] Oh.

938
00:52:04,289 --> 00:52:05,415
Latin.

939
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,253
And Portuguese.

940
00:52:13,923 --> 00:52:15,049
Bueno...

941
00:52:17,844 --> 00:52:19,804
Fantastico. [Laughs]

942
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:22,098
[Scribbling]

943
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:25,518
Would you be willing to work topless?

944
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:26,769
Yes.

945
00:52:32,692 --> 00:52:36,821
You will lose out on work
if you're not willing to do nudity.

946
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,326
So you'd be naked in a movie,
but you wouldn't make out with me?

947
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:44,009
You'd show the whole world your boobs,
but I'm not allowed to see?

948
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:45,558
You told me to say yes to everything.

949
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:46,831
I told you to say no to that.

950
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,208
- Well, I didn't know what to say.
- Say no!

951
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,880
I would get naked in a movie
if it gave me the part.

952
00:52:53,963 --> 00:52:55,643
Actresses get naked in movies
all the time.

953
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:56,924
What's wrong with that, Gary?

954
00:52:57,008 --> 00:52:59,177
Because there's too much nudity
in pictures right now.

955
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,971
- Oh, come on.
- And you're my friend. We're friends.

956
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:04,515
And you'd do it in a movie,
you'd show your boobs in a movie,

957
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:05,933
but you wouldn't show them to me!

958
00:53:06,017 --> 00:53:08,603
Why won't you ask someone your age
to see their boobs?

959
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:09,687
Because I'm asking you!

960
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:11,898
[Tires screeching]

961
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,218
[Knocking on door]

962
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:46,474
Do you really wanna see my boobs?

963
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,642
Yes.

964
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:52,146
- Where's Greg?
- He's in his room.

965
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:12,583
Can I touch them?

966
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:20,758
If you ever say anything to anyone,
I'm never speaking to you ever again.

967
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:23,177
I'll see you tomorrow.

968
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:38,484
Do you think it's weird I hang out
with Gary and his friends all the time?

969
00:54:50,121 --> 00:54:51,414
I think it's weird.

970
00:54:58,087 --> 00:54:59,964
It is whatever you think it is.

971
00:55:04,385 --> 00:55:06,262
I think it's weird
that I hang out with Gary

972
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,055
and his 15-year-old friends all the time.

973
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:20,860
["Lisa, listen to me" playing]

974
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:24,822
Are you happy?

975
00:55:24,906 --> 00:55:27,408
Yes, I'm happy. Are you happy?

976
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:29,118
If you're happy, I'm happy.

977
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:32,788
Of course I'm happy! You look so great.

978
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:33,956
Really?

979
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:48,387
Like "land ho," as it says on the sign.

980
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:50,681
- You can just float away on it.
- Riverboat.

981
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:53,351
Great for your back and your neck.

982
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,103
And arabian vinyl
is the best kind of vinyl.

983
00:55:56,187 --> 00:56:01,400
Nothing will puncture it. We've tested it
under, like, the worst conditions.

984
00:56:01,484 --> 00:56:05,154
This is our "big Bernie."
It's the "serious sleeper."

985
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:06,322
That right?

986
00:56:06,405 --> 00:56:09,951
"It's the classic design
copied by all the others."

987
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:13,162
Guys, calm down.
Don't wrestle on the bed, okay?

988
00:56:13,246 --> 00:56:15,957
I know she likes the bean bag,
but you need the big Bernie.

989
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:20,294
J” you've been silent for too long j”

990
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,759
j” once another man

991
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,594
sue pomerantz.

992
00:56:28,678 --> 00:56:29,845
[Sue] Gary Valentine.

993
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:31,430
[Laughs]

994
00:56:32,265 --> 00:56:36,352
This is our "arabian night,"
our highest-end model,

995
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,272
and also made from 100% arabian vinyl.

996
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:42,149
This is fat Bernie's
personal king-size mattress.

997
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:46,779
He has the heater, the headboard,
the side ashtrays, and the lamp fixtures.

998
00:56:46,862 --> 00:56:51,867
Hmm. And what happens if fat Bernie falls
asleep while he's smoking in his waterbed?

999
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:53,369
That is a great question.

1000
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:56,789
Actually, the water is too cold
to allow the cigarette to burn through.

1001
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:58,249
- Oh, that's smart.
- Uh-huh.

1002
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,333
So, it's cold?

1003
00:56:59,417 --> 00:57:02,086
Well, in the summer, it is,
and in the winter, it isn't.

1004
00:57:02,169 --> 00:57:04,672
Let me take you over here,
"land ho, the riverboat,"

1005
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:06,966
made with, also, arabian vinyl...

1006
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:08,884
[All chattering]

1007
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,764
Fat Bernie's waterbeds
and bean bag chairs.

1008
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,100
Hi, welcome to fat Bernie's.

1009
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:20,563
Welcome to fat Bernie's.

1010
00:57:22,898 --> 00:57:25,985
Hi. And who is this, Gary?

1011
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,278
- Gary.
- [Sue] Hi.

1012
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:30,281
I'm the manager here. I'm Alana.

1013
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,783
[Gary] Alana, sue. Sue, Alana.

1014
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,036
[Sue] Hello, it's nice to meet you.

1015
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:36,829
Hey, Gary, can I steal you for a second?

1016
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:40,166
I just wanna see
how you want these orders written out.

1017
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:41,417
[Gary] I'll be right there.

1018
00:57:42,293 --> 00:57:43,836
Well, I really need to know soon,

1019
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,963
because I really want
the papennork to be correct.

1020
00:57:46,047 --> 00:57:48,132
We don't wanna get it wrong
on the first day, do we?

1021
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,383
I'll be right there.

1022
00:57:54,013 --> 00:57:55,264
Is everything okay?

1023
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:56,474
Yes, of course.

1024
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,600
Is that your girlfriend?

1025
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,018
No, that is not my girlfriend.

1026
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:00,978
Does it seem like she's my girlfriend?

1027
00:58:01,062 --> 00:58:02,438
Kind of. [Scoffs]

1028
00:58:02,521 --> 00:58:06,776
No. I mean, no. She works for me.
She used to be my babysitter.

1029
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:33,678
Oof!

1030
00:58:34,804 --> 00:58:38,391
I'm so high. Kirk got me stoned.

1031
00:58:38,474 --> 00:58:40,267
[Liquid pouring]

1032
00:58:41,018 --> 00:58:42,019
Okay.

1033
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,688
I'm very happy, Gary.

1034
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:45,064
Mm-hmm.

1035
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:46,982
Congratulations.

1036
00:58:47,566 --> 00:58:50,194
- We did this together, didn't we?
- Uh-huh.

1037
00:58:50,277 --> 00:58:51,570
- We did it.
- We did it.

1038
00:58:51,654 --> 00:58:52,905
Are you happy?

some of the most outstanding feature films
in motion picture history.

1044
01:01:15,256 --> 01:01:17,967
Excuse me. What the fuck?

1045
01:01:23,848 --> 01:01:25,057
[Knocking on door]

1046
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,142
[Moti] Alana.

1047
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:30,479
[Jack] You know, rainbow,
you're a complete mystery to me.

1048
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:32,481
I don't know a word about you.

1049
01:01:33,148 --> 01:01:36,068
I don't know who your friends are,
if you've got parents.

1050
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:37,194
[Moti] Alana!

1051
01:01:37,278 --> 01:01:38,904
If you're in some kind of trouble,

1052
01:01:40,739 --> 01:01:42,241
you can tell me, you know.

1053
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,995
[Alana] There's no mystery here, Frankie.

1054
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:51,041
I come from intercourse, Pennsylvania.

1055
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,877
I know, I've heard all the jokes.

1056
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,461
[Chuckles] I didn't say a word.

1057
01:01:55,296 --> 01:01:57,006
It gets better.

1058
01:01:57,089 --> 01:01:59,425
You have to pass through faithful
to get there.

1059
01:02:00,175 --> 01:02:02,177
That must be quite some cross to bear.

1060
01:02:02,261 --> 01:02:03,387
[Chuckles]

1061
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,474
My parents are dead.

1062
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:12,646
They were killed in an automobile accident
five years ago.

1063
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:14,398
They were nice people.

1064
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,735
Nothing really happens
in intercourse, you know.

1065
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:21,906
So, as soon as I graduated high school,

1066
01:02:21,989 --> 01:02:25,492
I grabbed my bag and my guitar
and I came to California.

1067
01:02:28,495 --> 01:02:30,205
And cut-a-rooski.

1068
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:31,290
That was wonderful.

1069
01:02:31,373 --> 01:02:32,875
Thank you, Alana.

1070
01:02:33,834 --> 01:02:36,045
This says you know how to ride a horse.

1071
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:37,546
Yes.

1072
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:39,840
[Sam] And you speak Portuguese.

1073
01:02:39,924 --> 01:02:40,966
Mm-hmm.

1074
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:46,221
Rainbow loves horses and archery.
That's a subplot we've been developing.

1075
01:02:46,305 --> 01:02:49,016
We would wanna make sure
that actresses under consideration

1076
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,935
are capable of doing these things.

1077
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:52,519
Yes, I can do both.

1078
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:57,024
Thank you, Alana. Thank you for coming.

1079
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:59,360
I feel like I've been with rainbow
for ten minutes.

1080
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:00,694
Don't you, Jack?

1081
01:03:01,612 --> 01:03:02,905
Absolutely.

[Alana] Thank you, Mr. Holden.

1083
01:03:09,495 --> 01:03:10,621
You know,

1084
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:14,917
you remind me of grace.

1085
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,463

[Waiter] Mr. Holden, another Martini, sir?

1090
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:38,691
Yes, please. Another?

1091
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:40,442
Sure.

1092
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,236
Make it three.

1093
01:03:43,529 --> 01:03:45,906
I've never had a Martini before.

1094
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,200
They're good.

1095
01:03:49,618 --> 01:03:51,120
[Piano playing]

1096
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:53,080
The jungle.

1097
01:03:54,248 --> 01:03:55,833
That's where I'm most myself.

1098
01:03:57,418 --> 01:03:58,752
Not this jungle.

1099
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,714
Africa.

1100
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:05,551
Oh. Yes, Africa.

1101
01:04:05,634 --> 01:04:10,139
I saw two of my best black friends
beheaded in the Congo.

1102
01:04:11,807 --> 01:04:14,935
I'll tell you intimacies
I've shared with no one.

1103
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:20,566
But don't ask me about Kuala Lumpur.

1104
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:27,740
Is this lines or is this real?

1105
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:32,828
You're such a delicate creature.

1106
01:04:34,747 --> 01:04:36,248
You are rainbow.

- [Coughing]
- It's true.

1110

Is that Rex damn blau?

1111
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,347

1122
01:05:21,502 --> 01:05:23,462
- [Gary] Think of any six numbers.
- Okay.

1123
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,297
- I can guess them.
- Okay.

1124
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:28,842
You're thinking six, three, four, five.

A wonderful desert sled.
It's out there for you, Jack.

between two targets.

They're the most important targets
in all of Korea.

1184
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:23,892
Consequently,
they're fortified accordingly.

Although we're only over the targets
30 seconds, it's a lifetime.

We're going to Korea?

I don't understand. But I'm sexy, right?

1188
01:08:38,073 --> 01:08:42,995
Every gun imaginable
is hidden in those mountainsides.

1189
01:08:43,078 --> 01:08:46,290
- And the men behind the guns...

from occupied territories.

If the arab countries keep that pledge,

it would reduce their production
by almost 50% in one year.

01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,451
- "Sand."
- "sand." Yeah, like "sands."

1361
01:20:30,535 --> 01:20:32,513
- Like the ocean, like beaches.
- Barbra "seisand."

1362
01:20:32,537 --> 01:20:34,372
[Sighs] No. It's "Streisand."

1363
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:35,790
"Sand."

1364
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,542
- Streisand.
- Streisand.

1365
01:20:40,169 --> 01:20:41,421
Barbra Streisand.

1366
01:20:43,006 --> 01:20:44,590
Barbra "streizand."

1367
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:49,012
[Jon] Are you fucking with me?
All right, let's get past that.

1368
01:20:49,095 --> 01:20:51,295
Hopefully, you never fucking meet her.
She'll fucking...

1369
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:54,851
You think I'm bad.
We're going to the movies right now

1370
01:20:54,934 --> 01:20:57,204
and I'm on my way to pick her up,
so I'm gonna leave you here,

1371
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,873
but I wouldn't normally leave somebody
in my house when I'm not there,

1372
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,774
but I have to,
because you guys are so late.

1373
01:21:01,858 --> 01:21:02,984
I'm sorry. There was no gas.

1374
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:06,070
That's an excuse I'm gonna shove up
your fucking penis hole, man.

1375
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,490
- [Sighs] What's your name?
- Gary.

1376
01:21:09,574 --> 01:21:12,201
Gary. Gary. How big is your penis hole?

1377
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:13,703
It's regular-sized.

1378
01:21:13,786 --> 01:21:15,371
Hmm. How would you know?

1379
01:21:15,455 --> 01:21:18,541
Imagine what that would feel like,
if I shoved that excuse up there.

1380
01:21:18,624 --> 01:21:20,251
- That would hurt a lot, right?
- Yeah.

1381
01:21:21,002 --> 01:21:22,795
[Jon] But that's what I'd like to do.

1382
01:21:22,879 --> 01:21:25,107
I'm sorry. I don't wanna make you
any more late than you are.

1383
01:21:25,131 --> 01:21:26,132
You can leave.

1384
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:29,052
Look at you, you cocky motherfucker.

1385
01:21:30,803 --> 01:21:31,888
I like it.

1386
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,438
We speak the same language.
We're both from the streets.

1387
01:21:40,521 --> 01:21:41,522
Yeah.

1388
01:21:41,606 --> 01:21:43,816
I didn't see it before. That's... wow.

1389
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,527
Wow, you get right in there and you do it.

1390
01:21:46,611 --> 01:21:48,529
Wow. You have a little, um...

1391
01:21:48,613 --> 01:21:51,657
You have a tincture in your left eye.
It means you're deficient in vitamin k.

1392
01:21:51,741 --> 01:21:53,534
I'm like a fucking doctor.

1393
01:21:53,618 --> 01:21:56,746
You need to take more vitamin d
and COD liver oil.

1394
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,122
You see that Daytona Ferrari?

1395
01:21:58,206 --> 01:21:59,999
- [Gary] Yeah.
- Yeah, that's mine.

1396
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:05,046
Gary, that's filled with gas.
That's gonna get me to the movies on time.

1397
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:07,632
'Cause I'm not a shithead, idiot fuck-up.
I'm Jon Peters.

1398
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:09,884
My only problem in life
is that I love tail too much.

1399
01:22:10,426 --> 01:22:12,303
I love it. I love it so much.

1400
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,931
I love it so much. Is that your sister?

1401
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:17,767
- It's your girlfriend?
- No.

1402
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:24,482
I love it so much,
it's gonna kill me one day.

1403
01:22:25,066 --> 01:22:27,151
- You know how much tail I get?
- [Gary] No.

1404
01:22:27,235 --> 01:22:28,277
[Jon] All of it.

1405
01:22:29,195 --> 01:22:30,655
It's all mine.

1406
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:32,782
- You like Barbra Streisand?
- [Gary] Yeah.

1407
01:22:32,865 --> 01:22:34,492
- [Jon] You do?
- [Gary] Mm-hmm.

1408
01:22:34,575 --> 01:22:35,910
[Jon] Do you?

1409
01:22:35,993 --> 01:22:37,036
Yeah.

1410
01:22:39,288 --> 01:22:42,208
I do, too. Gets boring, but, you know.

1411
01:22:43,167 --> 01:22:44,168
Yeah.

1412
01:22:45,086 --> 01:22:48,673
I'm gonna kill you and your family
if you fuck up my house.

1413
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,218
- Okay? Do you have a cat?
- [Gary] No.

1414
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:53,362
- You got a dog?
- [Gary] No.

1415
01:22:53,386 --> 01:22:55,197
- You have a brother and sister...
- [Gary] Brother.

1416
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:58,266
Yeah. Your brother? I'm gonna choke
your brother out in front of you, okay?

1417
01:22:58,349 --> 01:23:00,101
Steve's gonna look after you
while I'm gone.

1418
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:03,521
It's a pleasure to meet you, Gary.
I want you to be horrified.

1419
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:05,398
- [Gary] Okay.
- Your life's on the line.

1420
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:08,401
But you know from that, right?
It's the way of the streets.

1421
01:23:09,694 --> 01:23:11,195
[Engine revving]

1422
01:23:12,405 --> 01:23:13,698
[Honking]

1423
01:23:17,869 --> 01:23:21,706
Ms. Streisand? Hi, it's Steve. Mm-hmm.

1424
01:23:22,331 --> 01:23:23,833
Yes, he just left.

1425
01:23:25,918 --> 01:23:29,380
I also thought you might wanna know
that he ordered a waterbed this evening.

1426
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:31,883
Right now. Mm-hmm.

1427
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:35,178
Four small children
and a girl or a young woman.

1428
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,430
To be honest, I don't know what she is.

1429
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:39,932
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.

1430
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:46,272
Yes. Uh-huh. Sure will.
Thanks, Ms. Streisand. Uh-huh. Bye.

1431
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:48,107
Okay.

1432
01:23:53,905 --> 01:23:55,531
[Water gurgling]

1433
01:24:06,667 --> 01:24:08,794
I used to work with Julie Andrews.

1434
01:24:08,878 --> 01:24:11,339
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

1435
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:15,551
She was difficult.

1436
01:24:16,802 --> 01:24:17,887
Mm-hmm.

1437
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,514
[Water gurgling]

1438
01:24:27,480 --> 01:24:29,148
He said he was gonna kill Greg.

1439
01:24:58,427 --> 01:24:59,845
[Water splashing]

1440
01:25:08,896 --> 01:25:10,064
We're done. Let's go.

1441
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,200
[Kids laughing]

1442
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,663
[Laughing, chattering]

1443
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:30,918
- "I'm gonna choke your brother."
- Uh-huh.

1444
01:25:32,169 --> 01:25:34,255
I kept it inside,
but what I wanted to say was,

1445
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:36,299
"no, I'm gonna choke you."

1446
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:37,651
- Oh, yeah?
- I would've said it.

1447
01:25:37,675 --> 01:25:40,594
I was trying to stay cool, though.
I was trying to stay...

1448
01:25:40,678 --> 01:25:42,013
[Tires screech]

1449
01:25:56,485 --> 01:25:57,570
Scooch over.

1450
01:25:59,447 --> 01:26:03,993
Oh! Back it up. Oh, fuck.

1451
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:07,580
Oh! Oh!

1452
01:26:08,122 --> 01:26:09,623
We're going back up the hill, okay?

1453
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:10,958
Okay.

1454
01:26:12,418 --> 01:26:14,420
Oh! How'd it turn out?

1455
01:26:14,503 --> 01:26:15,880
It was good. It went well.

1456
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:17,443
You didn't fuck up my house, did you?

1457
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:20,760
You okay? Can you see okay?

1458
01:26:20,843 --> 01:26:22,303
- Yeah.
- Well, why don't you just...

1459
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,147
Why don't you just back in the driveway,
and then you can go straight.

1460
01:26:28,059 --> 01:26:30,478
Steve. Steve.

1461
01:26:42,615 --> 01:26:44,742
You blew it, man. You blew it.

1462
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,035
Did she call?

1463
01:26:46,118 --> 01:26:47,203
[Steve] No.

1464
01:26:47,286 --> 01:26:48,537
Goddamn it, Steve.

1465
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:54,210
Where the fuck is the...

1466
01:26:56,045 --> 01:26:59,465
There's no gas-o
in the goddamn car-o, Steve-O.

1467
01:26:59,548 --> 01:27:00,591
Motherfucker.

1468
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:10,559
How long you guys been together?

1469
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:13,562
- Me and her?
- Yeah.

1470
01:27:13,646 --> 01:27:15,439
- We're not together.
- We're not together.

1471
01:27:15,523 --> 01:27:16,649
Why not?

1472
01:27:17,316 --> 01:27:18,401
I don't know.

1473
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,114
I'm 28.

1474
01:27:23,197 --> 01:27:24,824
- What's that?
- I'm 25.

1475
01:27:25,491 --> 01:27:27,159
You're 25? When's your birthday?

1476
01:27:28,285 --> 01:27:29,537
- December.
- December.

1477
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,580
Are you a capricorn? Sagittarius?

1478
01:27:31,664 --> 01:27:32,873
- Sagittarius.
- Sagittarius.

1479
01:27:32,957 --> 01:27:34,291
December what, 13th?

1480
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:36,210
- Fifteenth.
- Fifteenth.

1481
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:39,755
I was only two off. [Laughs]

1482
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:42,551
What do you wanna do
if you're not gonna do hair?

1483
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:45,052
Do you have sisters or brothers
or anything?

1484
01:27:45,136 --> 01:27:46,262
Sisters.

1485
01:27:46,345 --> 01:27:47,721
Are they older or younger?

1486
01:27:47,805 --> 01:27:48,848
Older.

1487
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,141
So you're the youngest?

1488
01:27:53,269 --> 01:27:56,272
How about your dad? Do you have
a good relationship with your dad?

1489
01:27:56,355 --> 01:27:57,982
- Yeah.
- What's he do?

1490
01:27:59,525 --> 01:28:01,444
- Real estate.
- Oh, yeah?

1491
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:03,696
Did he teach you how to drive?

1492
01:28:04,405 --> 01:28:05,656
You're really good at it.

1493
01:28:05,739 --> 01:28:07,116
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1494
01:28:07,908 --> 01:28:10,744
It's not easy. Gary can't do it.

1495
01:28:19,545 --> 01:28:21,797
All right. Just slow it down now, okay?
There she is.

1496
01:28:23,299 --> 01:28:25,342
Okay, do you have enough room? Yeah?

1497
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:26,552
[Alana] Mm-hmm.

1498
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:28,679
- You sure?
- I think so.

1499
01:28:28,762 --> 01:28:30,598
I parked on the side
so no one would hit it.

1500
01:28:30,681 --> 01:28:33,684
Here. I don't want you to have to
bear the burden in case we hit it.

1501
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,019
Why don't I take the wheel

1502
01:28:35,102 --> 01:28:38,105
and then you just put your foot
on the clutch and just feather the brake.

1503
01:28:38,189 --> 01:28:40,107
That's it. We'll do it together, okay?

1504
01:28:40,191 --> 01:28:42,067
Yeah, we'll do it together, okay?

1505
01:28:42,151 --> 01:28:47,072
Here we go. Oh, yeah. Smooth.
Smooth, yeah. Just breathe.

1506
01:28:47,156 --> 01:28:50,451
We got it. Yeah, we got it.
I think we got it.

1507
01:28:50,534 --> 01:28:54,538
Look. Look, look. Over there.
You see? We got it.

1508
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:58,834
We did it. That's so good, Alana.

1509
01:28:58,918 --> 01:29:01,670
Oh. [Laughs]

1510
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,794
- [Alana] Yeah. No.
- [Jon] We didn't hit it at all.

1511
01:29:03,839 --> 01:29:06,509
- [Alana] I...
- Oh, you smell so good.

1512
01:29:07,092 --> 01:29:08,219
Vvhoo!

1513
01:29:08,761 --> 01:29:11,764
Oh, Gary. Gary, Gary, Gary.

1514
01:29:12,890 --> 01:29:14,892
Get some gas and I'll be on my way.

1515
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:16,185
[Rumbling]

1516
01:29:17,895 --> 01:29:21,357
Oh, shit. Look at this line, man.

1517
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,816
[Horns honking]

1518
01:29:23,943 --> 01:29:26,946
Fucking sardines packed in.
Okay. Go, just make a left here.

1519
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:28,572
I'm not waiting in this motherfucker.

1520
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:31,325
All right, let that carjust go past.
There you go.

1521
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:34,537
Okay, now stop it.
They'll move out of the way.

1522
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:37,081
Yeah, yeah, okay. Okay, stop the car.

1523
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:38,707
[Tires screech]

1524
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:44,547
God. Fuck. Son of a bitch. Fucking shit!

1525

Go. Let's go. Let's go.

- Okay. Relax.

[Gary chuckles] Want some gas, Jon?
I got your gas.

1536
01:30:22,793 --> 01:30:25,129
I got your gas right here, Jon.

Where are we?

1545
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,005
I don't know.

1546
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:11,884
No, no, no, we ran out of gas.
You have to push the truck.

1547
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,767
Why the fuck are you staring at me?
Push the truck. What are you doing?

I can make a right

the mobil station's closer.

- [Woman] I like it a bit nutty.

No, you have the serve.
You have a bigger serve.

1606
01:36:06,178 --> 01:36:07,387
Not much.

1607
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:12,351
I was calling to see
if you still work for Joel wachs?

1608
01:36:13,185 --> 01:36:15,062
Yes, lsure do.

1609
01:36:15,145 --> 01:36:16,939
Well, do you need volunteers?

1610
01:36:17,648 --> 01:36:19,107
We always do.

1611
01:36:20,067 --> 01:36:21,234
Do you mean you?

1612
01:36:22,653 --> 01:36:23,779
Yes.

1613
01:36:25,155 --> 01:36:28,909
Alana, please come and work with us.
We need you.

1614
01:36:29,618 --> 01:36:31,036
I've seen how you do your homework.

1615

Oh, my god, you remember that?

1629
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,759
Joel, you're the youngest
councilman in the city.

1630
01:37:27,843 --> 01:37:29,928
- You're also its only bachelor.
- [Joel] Yes.

1631
01:37:30,012 --> 01:37:32,180
How do you find time for a social life?

1632
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:34,141
Being single means
I have more time to work,

1633
01:37:34,224 --> 01:37:37,978
and a councilman's schedule pretty much
ruins a social life anyway, so...

1634
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:39,980
What do your dates say about that?

1635
01:37:40,063 --> 01:37:43,275
They're not saying anything.
I'm not going on any dates, so...

1636
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,569
As you can imagine,
it's probably pretty difficult

1637
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:47,612
for somebody to be
a part of all the social events

1638
01:37:47,696 --> 01:37:49,740
that I'm a part of,
keep up with my busy schedule.

1639
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:53,326
But I imagine someday soon,
somebody's gonna come along

1640
01:37:53,410 --> 01:37:55,579
who'll wanna share that with me, so...

1641
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:57,706
Certainly you have some prospects?

1642
01:37:57,789 --> 01:38:00,917
I can't tell you how many times I've
heard, "boy, have I got the girl for you."

1643
01:38:01,001 --> 01:38:04,046
And I've met some pretty magnificent women
through my district residents.

1644
01:38:04,129 --> 01:38:06,506
But I'll tell you what I tell them,
and that's:

1645
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,633
"I'm sorry, but my time is spoken for."

1646
01:38:09,551 --> 01:38:11,344

No, I'm honored to meet you.
Thank you for coming on board.

01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:41,500
- I have integrity.
- [Chuckles] Me too.

1659
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,001
- I know.
- Honest.

1660
01:38:43,085 --> 01:38:45,128
- Mm-hmm. I'm that too.
- Okay. [Chuckles]

1661
01:38:46,004 --> 01:38:50,675
This is public land
which the state bought for $34, 000

1662
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,928
when everyone knew it was worth millions.

1663
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,347
Sam yorty and his cronies
would gladly destroy

1664
01:38:55,430 --> 01:38:59,184
this beautiful 225, 000-square-acre
mountain chain

1665
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:03,563
for fa vors, pa yofi's, and ugly houses
that only their friends can afford

1666
01:39:04,314 --> 01:39:06,817
but it needn't be that way, you see.

1667
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,902
I understand it's crazy,

1668
01:39:08,985 --> 01:39:11,029
and everybody's talking about
a revolution,

1669
01:39:11,113 --> 01:39:13,031
but it doesn't have to be that.

1670
01:39:13,115 --> 01:39:16,535
All that we need
are people in positions of power

1671
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:19,538
to remember to be who they were
when they were voted in.

1672
01:39:20,288 --> 01:39:21,998
And cut. That was great.

1673
01:39:22,082 --> 01:39:23,810
- I think that was the one.
- That felt good.

1674
01:39:23,834 --> 01:39:26,461
- Yeah, that was terrific, Joel.
- It did.

- You ready? We good?
- [Camera whirring]

01:39:43,436 --> 01:39:45,188
What would you say
to the people that think

1678
01:39:45,272 --> 01:39:47,524
you're too young
and don't have enough experience?

1679
01:39:47,607 --> 01:39:50,110
I would say, "thank you very much
for the compliment."

1680
01:39:50,193 --> 01:39:52,904
[Gary] Sorry, just... can you
say that again? We didn't get that.

1681
01:39:54,656 --> 01:39:56,825
- Really?
- [Gary] Yeah. Yeah.

1682
01:39:57,492 --> 01:39:59,578
[Alana] Sorry, councilman. [Clears throat]

1684
01:40:02,622 --> 01:40:03,748
One more time.

1685
01:40:05,125 --> 01:40:08,128
So, councilman, what would you say
to the people that say

1686
01:40:08,211 --> 01:40:10,672
you're too young
and don't have enough experience?

1687
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,091
I would say, "thank you very much
for the compliment."

1688
01:40:13,842 --> 01:40:15,051
The way I look at it...

1689
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:17,971
I'm sorry. Are you rolling?
Are you rolling?

1690
01:40:18,054 --> 01:40:19,431
I think we rolled out.

1691
01:40:19,514 --> 01:40:20,932
[Camera stops]

1692
01:40:21,016 --> 01:40:24,227
- We're gonna need to take five. I'm sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1693
01:40:24,936 --> 01:40:27,248
[Staffer] So, Joel, don't forget.
Tomorrow, you've got that

1694
01:40:27,272 --> 01:40:29,167
- toluca lake neighborhood council thing.
- [Joel] Yeah.

1695
01:40:29,191 --> 01:40:30,585
[Staffer] They'd love you there at 10:00.

1696
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,879
[Joel] What's been going on
with the pinball? Art's calling me.

1697
01:40:32,903 --> 01:40:34,547
- [Staffer] You hear about judge sachs?
- [Joel] I did.

1698
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:36,841
[Staffer] It's over. He lost five games
to nothing, so that's done.

1699
01:40:36,865 --> 01:40:37,908
[Joel] That's it?

1700
01:40:37,991 --> 01:40:40,469
[Staffer] Pinball will be legal again
in la for the first time since...

1701
01:40:40,493 --> 01:40:42,305
- [Joel] Wow.
- [Staffer] It's been illegal since 1939.

1702
01:40:42,329 --> 01:40:43,890
- Can you believe it?
- I can believe it.

1703
01:40:43,914 --> 01:40:46,166
It's an outmoded discriminatory law
in the first place,

1704
01:40:46,249 --> 01:40:47,542
so of course it took this long.

1705
01:40:47,626 --> 01:40:50,795
If I'm gonna call art, I need to know 100%
that this thing is passing.

1706
01:40:50,879 --> 01:40:53,423
It's passing. It's done.
I talked to all my people at the court.

1707
01:40:53,506 --> 01:40:55,926
It's over. It's...
Decision comes out tomorrow.

1708
01:40:57,802 --> 01:40:59,638
[Gary] Yes, it's Gary Valentine.

1709
01:41:00,472 --> 01:41:04,351
I started a new company
and I'm looking for some pinball machines.

1710
01:41:04,434 --> 01:41:06,061
[Chattering on TV]

1711
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:10,982
No? Okay.

1712
01:41:12,359 --> 01:41:14,653
Thank you for picking up my call.
Have a good day, Jimmy.

1713
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:16,029
[Hangs up phone]

1714
01:41:16,112 --> 01:41:17,280
[Cup clatters]

1715
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:21,284
Are you doing what I think you're doing?

1716
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,497
What do you think I'm doing?

1717
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,582
[Alana] Calling people
about pinball machines.

1718
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:30,335
That's what I'm doing.

1719
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:33,797
Because?

1720
01:41:35,048 --> 01:41:37,801
Because we could be
the first place open that has them.

1721
01:41:37,884 --> 01:41:40,595
Because we could start
"fat Bernie's pinball palace."

1722
01:41:41,763 --> 01:41:43,515
You know, we spent the day
with a great man

1723
01:41:43,598 --> 01:41:46,059
who's really trying to make a change
in how this city runs

1724
01:41:46,142 --> 01:41:49,729
and the only thing you fucking heard was,
"pinball machines are about to be legal."

1725
01:41:49,813 --> 01:41:51,523
I heard other things, too.

1726
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,358
[Phone ringing]

1727
01:41:58,071 --> 01:42:00,365
Yello. Gary Valentine here.

1728
01:42:01,283 --> 01:42:03,576
Don, thank you
for calling me back so swiftly.

1729
01:42:03,660 --> 01:42:05,870
"Swiftly"? Who are you?

1730
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:07,956
Yes. Yes.

1731
01:42:09,082 --> 01:42:11,418
Is there a time that's convenient for you
within your plans

1732
01:42:11,501 --> 01:42:13,503
that I could come lay some eyes
on the equipment?

1733
01:42:13,586 --> 01:42:16,506
- [Scoffs] Give me a fucking break, Gary.
- Great. Great.

1734
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:21,136
I'm ten minutes away. I'll be right over.
Thank you so much, Don.

1735
01:42:21,845 --> 01:42:22,971
I'm not driving you.

1736
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:25,265
That's great news,
'cause I can drive myself.

1737
01:42:25,348 --> 01:42:28,143
Mmm. You're gonna go on your own?

1738
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:30,061
- Big man.
- Yes, I am.

1739
01:42:34,899 --> 01:42:38,695
You smoke those cigarettes,
you're gonna throw up like a little bitch.

1740
01:42:42,407 --> 01:42:45,243
These cigarettes? These ones right here?

1741
01:42:46,703 --> 01:42:48,204
King-size mayburn.

1742
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:55,378
You don't have the balls.

1743
01:43:19,778 --> 01:43:23,573
I'm cooler than you. Don't forget it.

1744
01:43:24,282 --> 01:43:27,035
I don't need you to tell me
whether I'm cool or not, old lady.

1745
01:43:27,118 --> 01:43:29,037
- What was that?
- I said, "milady."

1746
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,514
- What was that?
- I said, "milady."

1747
01:43:30,538 --> 01:43:31,873
- What was that?
- "My lady."

1748
01:43:31,956 --> 01:43:34,751
I don't need you to tell me
whether I'm cool or not.

1749
01:43:36,211 --> 01:43:39,339
You're not cool, and your breath smells.

1750
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:44,594
Says you. And you're old.

1751
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:47,931
I'm old?

1752
01:43:48,973 --> 01:43:50,433
I don't know what's cool?

1753
01:43:51,184 --> 01:43:53,353
Changing the world isn't cool?

1754
01:43:54,396 --> 01:43:55,688
Go ask Brian if you're cool.

1755
01:43:55,772 --> 01:44:01,611
I will. Who thinks you're cool, Gary?
Your waterbed fans?

1756
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:04,531
Sue, kirk, and Mark? [Scoffs]

1757
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:07,117
I hang out with more people than that.

1758
01:44:07,200 --> 01:44:09,411
You don't even know
what's going on in the world.

1759
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:12,956
You think that the world
revolves around Gary Valentine

1760
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:14,719
and whatever stupid shit you come up with.

1761
01:44:14,749 --> 01:44:15,834
- It does.
- It doesn't.

1762
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:17,877
- It does.
- It doesn't. It's about more.

1763
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:19,254
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1764
01:44:19,337 --> 01:44:20,505
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

1765
01:44:20,588 --> 01:44:24,050
Alana, you would still be taking pictures
at my high school of children

1766
01:44:24,134 --> 01:44:25,635
if it wasn't for me.

1767
01:44:30,682 --> 01:44:33,059
You're talking about pinball machines.

1768
01:44:33,810 --> 01:44:35,437
I'm a politician.

1769
01:44:39,023 --> 01:44:40,733
I need to get my life together.

1770
01:44:44,237 --> 01:44:46,030
So, get it together.

1771
01:44:46,114 --> 01:44:47,866
Where are you going?

1772
01:44:47,949 --> 01:44:49,200
I'm going out.

1773
01:44:49,909 --> 01:44:51,619
Okay, I'll take you.

1774
01:44:54,289 --> 01:44:57,250
Come on, you wanna go see
these stupid pinball machines or what?

1775
01:44:59,252 --> 01:45:01,713
Gary, I'm gonna take you. It's fine.

1776
01:45:02,338 --> 01:45:03,423
Gary.

1777
01:45:04,841 --> 01:45:08,845
What is your problem?
Don't you get in that car.

1778
01:45:08,928 --> 01:45:10,889
Don't you fucking get in that car.

1779
01:45:12,474 --> 01:45:15,310
Gary fucking Valentine,
if you get in that car,

1780
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:17,270
I will never speak to you ever again.

1781
01:45:17,353 --> 01:45:19,105

good morning. This is Alana Kane calling
from councilman Joel wachs' office.

1794
01:46:00,063 --> 01:46:01,606
Am I catching you at a good time?

1795
01:46:03,650 --> 01:46:06,110
I'm calling to ask if you've heard
of the councilman's efforts

1796
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,654
to reduce corruption in our local...

1797
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:10,573
Well, fuck you, then.

1798
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:17,539
So, what's going on with the analysis?

1799
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:19,165
- That's len barton's thing.
- Mm-hmm.

1800
01:46:19,249 --> 01:46:21,084
They're small, but...

1801
01:46:21,167 --> 01:46:24,212
Good morning, this is Alana Kane calling
from councilman Joel wachs' office.

1802
01:46:24,295 --> 01:46:25,672

Yes, I'm calling...

01:46:29,968 --> 01:46:31,553
- Alana.
- I'm so sorry, I have to go.

1805
01:46:31,636 --> 01:46:33,763
- Oh, sorry about that.
- Sorry.

1806
01:46:33,846 --> 01:46:35,807
- Is it okay if I tell you something?
- Yeah.

1807
01:46:35,890 --> 01:46:41,479
Um, I've been known to be
a little forgetful, absentminded, and...

1808
01:46:42,355 --> 01:46:44,440
Look at me,
I can't even remember what I'm saying.

1809
01:46:44,524 --> 01:46:46,442
But ever since you've gotten here,

1810
01:46:46,526 --> 01:46:50,738
I've been very organized, capable,
andinspved.

1811
01:46:50,822 --> 01:46:53,658
So, thank you for that.

1812
01:46:54,325 --> 01:46:55,660
Thank you, councilman.

1813
01:46:56,411 --> 01:46:57,453
That's it.

1814
01:47:16,306 --> 01:47:17,599

1816
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:20,685
Am I catching you at a good time?

1817
01:47:21,352 --> 01:47:23,855
I'm calling to ask if you've heard
of the councilman's efforts

1818
01:47:23,938 --> 01:47:25,378
to reduce corruption in our local...

1819
01:47:27,650 --> 01:47:28,818
Well, fuck you, then.

1820
01:47:31,821 --> 01:47:33,740
[Phone ringing]

1821
01:47:34,616 --> 01:47:37,493
Councilman Joel wachs' office.
This is Alana. How may I help you?

1822
01:47:37,577 --> 01:47:39,746
- [Danielle on phone] Hey, it's me.
- Oh, hey.

1823
01:47:39,829 --> 01:47:41,080
What are you doing?

1824
01:47:41,164 --> 01:47:42,707
Working. What are you doing?

1825
01:47:43,666 --> 01:47:48,338
Gary just came by and dropped ofi'
a fl yer for his pinball palace.

1826
01:47:48,421 --> 01:47:50,131
What did he say?

1827
01:47:50,214 --> 01:47:52,467
Well, he wanted to see if we would go.

1828
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,677
And he wanted to make sure
you knew about it.

1829
01:47:55,386 --> 01:47:56,721
What else did he say?

1830
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:59,557
Well, I think he misses you.

1831
01:47:59,641 --> 01:48:01,309
He said that?

1832
01:48:01,392 --> 01:48:04,937
No, but he looked really sad.

1833
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:06,189
And sweet.

1834
01:48:07,357 --> 01:48:08,941
He asked about Brian.

1835
01:48:10,443 --> 01:48:11,694
Mmm.

1836
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:15,865
You should just go to his pinball store.

1837
01:48:15,948 --> 01:48:17,241
I can't. I'm working.

1838
01:48:17,325 --> 01:48:19,327
But they have free Pepsi.

1839
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:22,163
And it's open till midnight.

1840
01:48:22,914 --> 01:48:24,082
Pepsl_

1841
01:48:24,165 --> 01:48:25,667
- There's a band.
- Free Pepsi.

1842
01:48:25,750 --> 01:48:28,419
Danielle, I'm eliminating
state property tax for the elderly

1843
01:48:28,503 --> 01:48:30,922
and saving the mountains
and you're talking about free Pepsi.

1844
01:48:32,090 --> 01:48:34,676
Brian, do you see that guy over there?

1845
01:48:37,929 --> 01:48:39,180
Number 12 guy?

1846
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,849
[Alana] Yeah. I think he's spying on us.

1847
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:43,851
He keeps looking over here like a creep.

1848
01:48:45,812 --> 01:48:47,271
He doesn't look weird to you?

1849
01:48:49,899 --> 01:48:51,192
He does, a little.

1850
01:48:51,275 --> 01:48:55,071
He's been there all morning.
Go say something to him.

1851
01:48:56,072 --> 01:48:57,657
[Brian] Just leave him.

1852
01:48:57,740 --> 01:49:00,159
If he stays there too long,
I'll say something.

1853
01:49:06,708 --> 01:49:08,000
Can I help you?

1854
01:49:08,876 --> 01:49:10,128
I don't know.

1855
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:12,588
You're staring at our office.

1856
01:49:13,589 --> 01:49:16,759
Yeah, my eyes need some place to go.

1857
