1
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,386
Well, Miss Timberlake, back again
for a little of the taxpayers' money, hmm?

2
00:03:15,146 --> 00:03:17,441
- So did you work last week?
- No.

3
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,571
- Are you available for work?
- Yes.

4
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:21,701
- Did you turn down any jobs?
- No.

5
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,706
- Are you busy tonight?
- Yes.

6
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:28,213
If, in our opinion,
the applicant hasn't exercised

7
00:03:28,298 --> 00:03:31,179
proper diligence in seeking employment,

8
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:33,725
we can withhold payment of cheques.

9
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:35,855
Perhaps tomorrow night?

10
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:40,655
There's a wonderful little diner
round the corner from where I live

11
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:43,620
and after dinner we could, uh, well...

12
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:48,464
...perhaps...
- Go up to your apartment?

13
00:03:51,093 --> 00:03:54,976
- Well, I, uh...
- If you want me to go up to your apartment

14
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:59,736
come out and ask. That way I can
think about it and make a decision.

15
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:03,410
Would you like to stop off at my place?

16
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,877
- May I have my cheque?
- Oh. Of course.

17
00:04:18,316 --> 00:04:20,195
Well?

18
00:04:20,278 --> 00:04:23,368
I would enjoy going out with you,
Mr Beasley,

19
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:26,666
if I didn't find you so personally distasteful.

20
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:31,676
You're a sneaky, crude, offensive man.

21
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,805
That's just how I feel.

22
00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,273
I'm sure there are hundreds of girls
who admire those qualities.

23
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:42,156
I circled the entire area, sir.

24
00:04:42,239 --> 00:04:45,495
- There's no sign of her.
- Darn. Thank you, Collins.

25
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:52,509
Hit and run's a dangerous sport, Mr Shayne,
even for the privileged class.

26
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:56,518
Even if this victim survives,
what can she do? Sue you?

27
00:04:56,602 --> 00:05:01,528
With your money, you can run down half
the girls in New York and still be solvent.

28
00:05:01,612 --> 00:05:03,824
We hit a puddle, splashed the girl.

29
00:05:03,908 --> 00:05:06,664
Would you have me stop, tie up the traffic,

30
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:09,921
crawl through the rain
and beg forgiveness?

31
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:13,511
A decent gesture like that
would never occur to you.

32
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:17,310
So I'll set up a foundation
for waterlogged girls.

33
00:05:17,394 --> 00:05:20,024
Isn't it a little early for cocktails?

34
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,655
I'm perfectly aware of what I'm doing.

35
00:05:22,738 --> 00:05:25,369
- I have an analyst. Dr Gruber.
- I know.

36
00:05:25,452 --> 00:05:30,212
A distinguished analyst. I know exactly
what started me drinking at this hour.

37
00:05:30,295 --> 00:05:33,260
- What?
- Dr Gruber, he's a lush.

38
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:36,057
Seven years of treating you could do it.

39
00:05:36,141 --> 00:05:38,186
- Yeah.
- Look out.

40
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,610
- He's a brilliant man. Brilliant.
- Brilliant.

41
00:05:41,693 --> 00:05:45,827
He put his finger right on my problem -
my lack of integrity.

42
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:50,169
You were a humble but respected
professor of economics at Princeton.

43
00:05:50,253 --> 00:05:53,342
Students sat at my feet
absorbing my wisdom.

44
00:05:53,426 --> 00:05:55,680
The lvy League Socrates.

45
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:59,480
Then you came along
dangling $50,000 a year under my nose

46
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:02,277
and, to my everlasting shame, I sold out.

47
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:06,242
And every year you further humiliate me
by raising my salary.

48
00:06:06,327 --> 00:06:09,667
Inexcusable.
Like rubbing salt in the wounds.

49
00:06:09,751 --> 00:06:13,007
And at Christmas
you gave me stock in the company.

50
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:16,597
- Why are you trying to destroy me?
- Just my natural hostility.

51
00:06:16,682 --> 00:06:20,439
Excuse me.
Benson's attorneys say he still won't sell.

52
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:23,696
Roger, you researched that company.
What's it worth?

53
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:25,950
General Electronics? Six million.

54
00:06:26,033 --> 00:06:29,164
Offer six and a quarter,
tell him it's top dollar.

55
00:06:29,249 --> 00:06:30,668
Yes, sir.

56
00:06:30,751 --> 00:06:34,509
Roger, if that deal goes through,
you're in for a bonus.

57
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,263
Bonus?

58
00:06:36,346 --> 00:06:39,144
- Haven't you any conscience?
- What?

59
00:06:39,227 --> 00:06:44,612
Just when I'm reaching a point where I'll
have the courage to go back to Princeton.

60
00:06:44,697 --> 00:06:47,035
- Would it help if I fired you?
- No!

61
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:50,542
Dr Gruber said this would be
the worst time for that.

62
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:52,671
- Why?
- I owe him quite a bit of money.

63
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,218
He's brilliant!

64
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:57,347
Wait a minute. Yes?

65
00:06:57,431 --> 00:07:02,609
- 'Mrs Haskell and Mrs Farnum are here.'
- I'll see them in a moment.

66
00:07:02,692 --> 00:07:04,737
- There she is!
- Who?

67
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,867
- That girl I splashed.
- Where?

68
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:11,042
Just went into the automat.
Roger, go and apologise for me.

69
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:14,423
She's a blonde in a raincoat
with a leather collar.

70
00:07:14,507 --> 00:07:17,138
This is in case I damaged her clothes.

71
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:20,728
I'm a highly paid executive,
not a messenger boy.

72
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:24,193
OK, I'll go.

73
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:27,785
You hired me as your financial adviser.

74
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:31,834
Wouldn't send Bernard Baruch out
to pay off a girl for you.

75
00:07:33,045 --> 00:07:34,715
Oh, yes, you would.

76
00:07:48,243 --> 00:07:50,079
Connie?

77
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:52,418
Connie! Yoo-hoo!

78
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:55,382
- Where are you?
- In the cucumbers.

79
00:07:57,970 --> 00:07:59,474
Hi.

80
00:07:59,558 --> 00:08:03,106
That's the first smiling face today.
I only get hungry ones.

81
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,862
What'll it be? Chicken pie or turkey leg?

82
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,364
Chicken.

83
00:08:11,999 --> 00:08:14,046
How'd it go today? Any luck?

84
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:19,139
All bad. Some idiot splashed me
with his car, practically ruined my dress.

85
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:22,144
You should see me. He never even stopped.

86
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:25,276
- Then I had to face Beasley.
- What a parlay!

87
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:28,992
How is the playboy
of the 8th Avenue unemployment office?

88
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,833
He asked me to his apartment.
I told him what I thought of him.

89
00:08:32,916 --> 00:08:35,506
- Au gratin or baked potato?
- Baked.

90
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:41,852
He's not worth the trouble.
Does a snake know he's a snake?

91
00:08:41,935 --> 00:08:44,774
He crawls on his stomach
and thinks he's a king.

92
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,365
Right. You know, you're a philosopher.

93
00:08:48,448 --> 00:08:52,957
When a girl of my age still isn't married,
you either philosophise or get arrested.

94
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,878
- Carrots or peas?
- Carrots.

95
00:08:57,885 --> 00:09:02,351
Cathy, your problem is how to keep
your honour AND your job.

96
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:06,067
Men see you and suddenly their wives
just don't understand them.

97
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:08,740
I've never done anything to encourage them.

98
00:09:08,823 --> 00:09:11,454
You don't have to, nature did it for you.

99
00:09:11,537 --> 00:09:13,958
- Jell-o?
- Yeah.

100
00:09:14,042 --> 00:09:19,428
Now, there are just so many jobs for girls
who can operate computing machines.

101
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:22,685
The next job you get, you'll listen to me.

102
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:24,813
You don't comb your hair, no make-up,

103
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:28,613
wear military heels,
you remind them of their wives.

104
00:09:28,697 --> 00:09:32,539
They figure this they can get at home
so they leave you alone.

105
00:09:32,621 --> 00:09:37,047
Have some cake, it might make your
skin break out. See you later, honey.

106
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:40,012
OK. Hey, I have an interview after lunch

107
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,850
- so I'll call you when it's over.
- Good.

108
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,646
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

109
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,988
Mr Miller.

110
00:09:49,071 --> 00:09:51,118
Miss Emerson.

111
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:54,959
Are you familiar with company policy
on giving away free food?

112
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,923
No, sir. Are we for it or against it?

113
00:09:58,007 --> 00:10:01,305
That will cost you
one dollar and twelve cents.

114
00:10:01,389 --> 00:10:05,104
However, I might be willing
to overlook the incident

115
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,943
if you, uh, introduce me to your friend.

116
00:10:08,028 --> 00:10:11,659
- How is Mrs Miller?
- She doesn't understand me.

117
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:14,205
I could've made book on that answer.

118
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:26,899
Excuse me,
were you struck by a car this morning?

119
00:10:26,982 --> 00:10:29,821
- What?
- Splattered by a limousine?

120
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,992
Oh. Yes, I certainly was.

121
00:10:32,076 --> 00:10:36,209
The gentleman who owns the car
has offices across the street.

122
00:10:36,292 --> 00:10:40,843
He saw you from his window
and sent me to convey his regrets.

123
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,518
I should think a gentleman
would apologise himself.

124
00:10:44,601 --> 00:10:48,317
- Well, Mr Shayne's a very busy man.
- Oh, really?

125
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:52,951
Is that why he didn't stop?
That's leaving the scene of an accident.

126
00:10:53,035 --> 00:10:55,164
If there was any damage done...

127
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:59,382
My raincoat was practically ruined.
And look at this dress.

128
00:10:59,464 --> 00:11:03,390
I've been authorised to compensate you
for any damage done.

129
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:06,103
- Well, you just tell Mr...
- Shayne.

130
00:11:06,186 --> 00:11:09,318
...Shayne, that money
does not buy good manners.

131
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,448
I wish I could tell him that myself.

132
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:14,329
- Do you? Really?
- I certainly do.

133
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,248
You're right!

134
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:20,090
How would you feel?
Here I am, he practically runs me down

135
00:11:20,174 --> 00:11:22,219
and then drives right away!

136
00:11:22,303 --> 00:11:25,560
And doesn't have the decency
to apologise himself.

137
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:29,150
Furthermore I have a job interview
and have to go like this.

138
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:31,739
- He doesn't care.
- Ohhh.

139
00:11:33,409 --> 00:11:36,666
- You know what I'd like to do?
- Throw the money in his face?

140
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,586
Exactly!

141
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,676
I'd like to throw that money right in his face.

142
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:43,805
- Would you?
- Yes, I would.

143
00:11:43,888 --> 00:11:46,686
I've waited seven years for this moment.

144
00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:48,816
You come with me.

145
00:11:52,949 --> 00:11:56,248
Say, Connie,
there's a man dragging Cathy out.

146
00:11:56,331 --> 00:11:59,963
Gee. They don't even
give her a chance to eat.

147
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:10,400
She's gonna spend the rest of her life
saying, "I'm not that kind of a girl."

148
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:14,952
I'm only afraid that some day,
before she can finish saying it, she will be.

149
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,962
There you are.

150
00:12:20,046 --> 00:12:25,097
The Manhattan Home for Young Women
thanks you for your generous donation

151
00:12:25,181 --> 00:12:27,351
and for permitting us to use your name

152
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:30,817
- in our fundraising drive.
- Well, it's a worthy cause.

153
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:36,037
There's a great need to provide
an atmosphere of care and understanding

154
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:38,166
during this critical period.

155
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:41,381
You'd be shocked
that the rate of unwed mothers...

156
00:12:41,464 --> 00:12:44,553
Charlotte, we don't
call them unwed mothers.

157
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:48,854
...that the rate of unfortunate girls
has tripled in five years.

158
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:51,693
- It's a deplorable situation.
- Yes, yes.

159
00:12:51,777 --> 00:12:54,407
There's one consolation, Mrs Farnum -

160
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:57,747
for every unwed mother,
there's an unwed father.

161
00:12:58,874 --> 00:13:00,920
I never thought of it that way.

162
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:03,676
Well, thank you again, Mr Shayne.

163
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:06,013
- Goodbye, Mr Shayne.
- Goodbye.

164
00:13:08,309 --> 00:13:12,527
Wasn't it sweet of him
to contribute so generously?

165
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:16,785
Mr Shayne doesn't deny he's responsible
for what happened to me?

166
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,915
- No.
- The least he could've done

167
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:23,508
was come to see me himself instead
of sending someone over with money.

168
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,306
Some men have no sense
of moral obligation.

169
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,898
Same thing happened to my friend Connie.
He never even told her his name.

170
00:13:30,981 --> 00:13:33,027
No. Have a seat.

171
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,157
I'll tell him you're here.

172
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:40,626
My dear, when the time comes,
call this number.

173
00:13:41,796 --> 00:13:43,840
Psst! Miss Timberlake.

174
00:13:49,185 --> 00:13:53,987
No wonder he donated so generously.
Guilt feelings.

175
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,449
Now, Evelyn, we must be realistic.

176
00:13:56,534 --> 00:14:01,544
When a man donates $200,000,
he's entitled to use the facilities.

177
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,138
He's in there, he'll be right out.
Don't forget what you're gonna say -

178
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:10,436
reckless driving,
leaving the scene of an accident,

179
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,942
bad manners, then the money in the face!

180
00:14:13,025 --> 00:14:16,658
There are few other things I'd do
if I weren't a lady.

181
00:14:16,741 --> 00:14:20,206
This is no time to think of sex. Now, go!

182
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,753
Mr Shayne, Miss Timberlake.

183
00:14:26,469 --> 00:14:28,098
Miss Timberlake?

184
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:31,395
Go get him.
Miss Timberlake has something to say.

185
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:35,947
Yes?

186
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,577
I- I'd like to apologise

187
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:41,918
uh, for getting in your way this morning.

188
00:14:42,001 --> 00:14:45,300
- It was entirely my fault.
- I was practically jaywalking.

189
00:14:45,382 --> 00:14:49,224
- You had a perfect right to be on the curb.
- I was leaning over.

190
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:55,194
I'm sorry I couldn't stop. My driver circled
the block but when we got back you'd gone.

191
00:14:55,277 --> 00:14:58,075
- Leaving the scene of an accident.
- Oh.

192
00:14:58,158 --> 00:15:01,708
I don't know why I left.
I must have gotten panicky.

193
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:03,378
Him, not you!

194
00:15:03,461 --> 00:15:06,718
Roger, don't you have a letter
to get off to Princeton?

195
00:15:09,181 --> 00:15:14,358
I should've come down to the restaurant
to apologise but I had some people here.

196
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:18,826
Knowing how busy you are, I'm surprised
you found time to send anyone.

197
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:22,291
If I've damaged anything in any way...

198
00:15:22,374 --> 00:15:24,421
Oh, not really.

199
00:15:24,504 --> 00:15:29,598
Water's good for raincoats,
and there's just a few spots on my dress.

200
00:15:29,682 --> 00:15:32,729
- I'll be glad to pay for a new dress.
- No, thank you.

201
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,818
I was going on an interview,
it wasn't important.

202
00:15:35,902 --> 00:15:39,535
You can't go on an interview like that.
Come with me.

203
00:15:41,163 --> 00:15:44,252
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne? '
- Send up the valet.

204
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:48,887
You can have your things back
in 20 minutes. You can change in there.

205
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:53,688
There's a bathroom on your right and in that
closet there's a topcoat you can wear.

206
00:15:55,441 --> 00:15:57,488
Well, go on, do as I tell you.

207
00:15:57,571 --> 00:15:59,576
That's right.

208
00:16:00,619 --> 00:16:03,500
- Connie, it's for you.
- Oh. Thanks.

209
00:16:04,628 --> 00:16:06,840
Hello? Cathy?

210
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,097
- Where'd you go?
- Across the street in Mr Shayne's office.

211
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,978
- What about your lunch?
- Once I get my dress back.

212
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:15,733
What floor are you on?
Millie, get the cleaver!

213
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,696
Honey, we'll be right over.

214
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:23,165
Connie, I'm all right. He sent my dress out
to have it cleaned.

215
00:16:23,249 --> 00:16:25,169
See you later.

216
00:16:27,132 --> 00:16:29,177
Sent it out to have it cleaned?

217
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:34,062
I have heard of sneaky ways
to undress a girl but...

218
00:16:38,112 --> 00:16:41,161
Isn't that the man
who took Cathy out of here?

219
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:42,913
Let me see.

220
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,961
That's the one.

221
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:02,829
The tractor division should show
an increase in earnings.

222
00:17:02,913 --> 00:17:06,461
Fine. Now we're back
to General Electronics.

223
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:10,302
Still no breakthrough.

224
00:17:10,387 --> 00:17:12,432
Come in.

225
00:17:12,515 --> 00:17:15,814
- Ooh, I'm sorry.
- Wait a minute, whoa.

226
00:17:16,941 --> 00:17:20,406
- Come on in.
- Mr Shayne, I thought you were alone.

227
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:25,375
Um, it didn't come back yet
and I have an appointment.

228
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,504
All right, I'll check on it.

229
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:30,928
Wait a minute.
Gentlemen, this is Miss Timberlake.

230
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:33,350
- How do you do?
- Come on in.

231
00:17:33,434 --> 00:17:37,232
- Oh, I didn't want to interrupt.
- You're not interrupting.

232
00:17:39,611 --> 00:17:43,203
Miss Timberlake, we need to know
why a man won't sell a company

233
00:17:43,286 --> 00:17:46,752
when we've offered him
more than it's worth. Go ahead.

234
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,509
Well, we've tried everyone.

235
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:55,227
We talked to Benson's lawyers,
his directors and his executive assistant.

236
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:58,734
Now, who else is there to talk to?

237
00:17:58,817 --> 00:18:00,864
There, you see.

238
00:18:02,993 --> 00:18:06,918
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?
- Have you talked to Mr Benson?

239
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,047
Well...

240
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,802
no.

241
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,681
No, they haven't talked to Mr Benson.

242
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,191
Well, the same thing happened
to my Aunt Rachel.

243
00:18:18,273 --> 00:18:23,869
Um, this man she knows in the next town
kept sending her letters proposing to her,

244
00:18:23,952 --> 00:18:26,416
and she just kept turning him down.

245
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:32,469
Now, she wanted to get married but
she felt that he should've asked in person.

246
00:18:34,141 --> 00:18:36,185
There, you see, gentlemen.

247
00:18:36,269 --> 00:18:41,195
Perhaps Mr Benson is eager to become
a bride but has never been asked.

248
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,536
How would your Aunt Rachel have felt
about a phone call?

249
00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:48,252
Oh, no. She wouldn't say yes
till he came to the house.

250
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,381
They have eight children now.

251
00:18:50,466 --> 00:18:53,763
Well, that couldn't have happened
over the phone.

252
00:18:53,846 --> 00:18:56,478
Miss Timberlake,

253
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,984
how would you like to go for a ride with me?
Come on.

254
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,448
What are you doing in Baltimore?

255
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:05,453
I'm here with Mr Shayne. We...

256
00:19:05,536 --> 00:19:08,000
Well, of course I've got my clothes on.

257
00:19:08,084 --> 00:19:11,048
Connie, we flew here in his private plane.

258
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:15,557
Gosh, you should see it,
it's completely furnished. Even has a bar.

259
00:19:15,642 --> 00:19:19,315
Honey, this time
you've run into a shrewd one.

260
00:19:19,398 --> 00:19:22,321
Once he gets you up there, you can't argue.

261
00:19:22,404 --> 00:19:24,451
It's hit the silk or else.

262
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:29,920
Connie, he's here to buy a company and
he brought me along as a good luck charm.

263
00:19:31,631 --> 00:19:33,678
I'll call you back. Bye.

264
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:38,186
- What happened?
- Well, Aunt Rachel said yes.

265
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:41,277
- Good.
- And I owe it all to you.

266
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,867
Miss Timberlake,
I'm glad I almost ran you down this
morning.

267
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,996
I am too.

268
00:19:47,079 --> 00:19:50,629
Let's go and toast that puddle
that brought us together.

269
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:53,844
- Do you care for Italian food?
- Oh, I love it.

270
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:57,475
Good, I know a little place,
if you like fettucine?

271
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,649
- Er, yes.
- This is the only place to have it.

272
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:12,131
- Hello?
- 'Hi.'

273
00:20:12,214 --> 00:20:14,219
Cathy? Where are you?

274
00:20:14,302 --> 00:20:17,517
- In Philadelphia.
- 'What are you doing there? '

275
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,105
It's the only place to have fettucine.

276
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:25,575
I should've thought of that. I thought he took
you there to buy you the Liberty Bell.

277
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:30,501
Get off that merry-go-round. He's just
another Beasley with a flying bedroom.

278
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:35,387
Oh, Connie, he's not like anyone.
You've never met a man like this.

279
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,516
That's the problem, neither have you.

280
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,189
- I have so much to tell you when I get back.
- 'If you get back.'

281
00:20:41,274 --> 00:20:44,238
We're leaving, I'll talk to you later. Bye.

282
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:50,959
- Well, did you get your roommate?
- Yes. She said to be sure and say hello.

283
00:20:51,043 --> 00:20:56,012
You'll have to pay the piper for dinner by
sitting through a report I'm due to deliver.

284
00:20:56,095 --> 00:20:57,765
I don't mind.

285
00:20:57,849 --> 00:21:03,402
How do you feel about untapped natural
resources of underdeveloped countries?

286
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,992
I think they ought to be tapped.

287
00:21:07,076 --> 00:21:11,376
Hmm. You've condensed
a 40-minute speech into one sentence.

288
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:18,808
The wealth of a nation
is in the wellbeing of its people,

289
00:21:18,892 --> 00:21:21,898
both spiritually and materialistically.

290
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,112
It's not a question of lowering our standards

291
00:21:25,196 --> 00:21:28,035
but of helping others to raise theirs.

292
00:21:28,118 --> 00:21:31,000
If all people everywhere could be content

293
00:21:31,084 --> 00:21:35,299
and their living standards even
and compatible with ours,

294
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:37,429
there would be no envy in the world

295
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:40,853
and, therefore, less provocation of war.

296
00:21:42,022 --> 00:21:46,364
When you encourage and help people
to develop their own natural resources,

297
00:21:46,448 --> 00:21:48,868
you do more than put bread in their mouths,

298
00:21:48,953 --> 00:21:50,999
you put dignity in their hearts.

299
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:59,057
Even the Russians are applauding.

300
00:22:03,691 --> 00:22:06,154
- Isn't he magnificent?
- Yeah.

301
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:09,995
- His car nearly ran me down this morning.
- Ooh!

302
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:12,543
- Yeah.
- What a delightful way to go.

303
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:18,429
Now we've discussed
the world's natural resources,

304
00:22:18,513 --> 00:22:20,559
let's explore some of our own.

305
00:22:20,642 --> 00:22:25,318
Miss Timberlake, New York's a wonderful
city, what would you like to do with it?

306
00:22:25,401 --> 00:22:29,117
I don't know.
I've never been offered a city before.

307
00:22:29,202 --> 00:22:32,458
That doesn't speak well
for the boys back home.

308
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:37,885
It's really not their fault. "Miss Timberlake,
I offer you Upper Sandusky."

309
00:22:37,968 --> 00:22:41,685
- You see?
- It doesn't have the same ring.

310
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:45,318
What is a pretty girl offered
in Upper Sandusky?

311
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:48,156
Baseball.

312
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,328
I went to a lot of baseball games.

313
00:22:50,412 --> 00:22:53,668
A friend of mine has a box
behind the third base dugout.

314
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,300
- Oh, that's nice.
- Cougars won the pennant in '58.

315
00:22:57,384 --> 00:23:00,473
If you like baseball we've got a local team.

316
00:23:00,557 --> 00:23:03,981
Oh, the Yankees. Oh.

317
00:23:04,063 --> 00:23:06,944
The Cougars they are not but they try hard.

318
00:23:15,754 --> 00:23:18,009
Strike!

319
00:23:18,092 --> 00:23:23,854
Strike? Hey, ump! Shake your head,
your eyeballs are stuck!

320
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:26,943
It was a ball! It was that far from the plate.

321
00:23:28,906 --> 00:23:33,916
Little lady, will you let me umpire this game?
You've been on my back all night.

322
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:37,632
- Mickey, you saw that pitch. It was a ball.
- It looked like it.

323
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,677
You're out of the game, Mantle.

324
00:23:39,762 --> 00:23:42,100
What? Roger, how'd that pitch look?

325
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:45,106
- It could've missed the corner.
- You're out, Maris.

326
00:23:47,068 --> 00:23:50,992
- Yogi.
- It's a perfect strike, the ump was right.

327
00:23:51,077 --> 00:23:54,667
I don't like sarcasm, Berra.
You're out of the game too!

328
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,796
You can't do that!

329
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,926
Lady...

330
00:23:59,009 --> 00:24:02,391
- Where's the manager?
- I think he's hiding.

331
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:05,397
Oh! Ooh...

332
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,570
I didn't mean to get
all those men thrown out.

333
00:24:08,653 --> 00:24:11,451
It proved they could win
without their starting line-up.

334
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:15,000
I always get that way at ball games.
I lose control.

335
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,129
Well, it's over now, we won.

336
00:24:17,213 --> 00:24:20,511
I know just the place
where you could calm down.

337
00:24:20,594 --> 00:24:22,892
- Where?
- My apartment.

338
00:24:41,303 --> 00:24:44,811
It's not ready for a housewarming
but how do you like it?

339
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:49,320
- It's beautiful up here.
- I might put in some walls over there.

340
00:24:49,403 --> 00:24:54,121
And perhaps a ceiling,
just to give it that traditional touch.

341
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:56,251
That would be nice.

342
00:24:58,338 --> 00:25:01,511
The, er, the living room will be there,

343
00:25:01,595 --> 00:25:03,640
and the bedroom there.

344
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:06,104
I think the bedroom should be there.

345
00:25:06,187 --> 00:25:08,233
Wherever you say.

346
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:10,363
And I love fireplaces.

347
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:14,788
There'll be one in every room.
And bookcases, I like books everywhere.

348
00:25:14,872 --> 00:25:17,920
- And good reading lamps.
- That's the idea.

349
00:25:18,003 --> 00:25:21,135
- Plenty of paintings.
- Mmm. And a built-in oven.

350
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:25,100
- And a sunken bathtub.
- Oh, I love taking sunken baths.

351
00:25:25,185 --> 00:25:27,230
You'd always find me in it.

352
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:32,657
I didn't mean it that way, I...

353
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:36,207
I know you didn't.
But let's not abandon the idea.

354
00:25:37,375 --> 00:25:39,046
Cathy...

355
00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:41,760
I've got to go to Bermuda for a few days.

356
00:25:41,843 --> 00:25:44,223
How would you like to join me there?

357
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:46,353
Then we could go on to Paris.

358
00:25:46,436 --> 00:25:49,776
- Have you ever been to Paris?
- No.

359
00:25:49,859 --> 00:25:53,242
That's the best way to see it,
for the first time.

360
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:59,045
I know a restaurant in Paris where you can
get some marvellous French food.

361
00:25:59,127 --> 00:26:01,174
Then we'll go to Monte Carlo,

362
00:26:01,258 --> 00:26:05,724
where I can get a friend to take us
for a cruise around the Greek islands.

363
00:26:05,809 --> 00:26:09,233
That's the only way to see them -
slowly, by boat.

364
00:26:09,316 --> 00:26:13,032
They're like fine paintings -
you mustn't rush up to them.

365
00:26:13,115 --> 00:26:18,000
We'll continue around the world, get back,
and this building will be finished.

366
00:26:18,084 --> 00:26:23,136
If you don't like this apartment
you can have one of the others.

367
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:25,682
- May I ask one question?
- Go on.

368
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,104
Did you just ask me to marry you?

369
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:29,899
No.

370
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:36,622
- Oh.
- I didn't mean to mislead you.

371
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,751
Oh, you didn't.

372
00:26:40,087 --> 00:26:43,176
You're very honest and I admire you for that.

373
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,223
- Then you're not offended.
- No.

374
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:49,397
Well, then what is it?

375
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,030
I'm a little frightened of you.

376
00:26:54,282 --> 00:26:57,163
Oh, I know many people
who can't stand me.

377
00:26:57,246 --> 00:26:59,293
I can stand you all right.

378
00:26:59,376 --> 00:27:02,215
Now, Cathy, if this presents a problem...

379
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:07,476
You know, Mr Shayne, I feel I can trust you.

380
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,604
What would you advise me to do?

381
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:13,238
Oh, please, I'm hardly in a position
to give advice.

382
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,033
But I respect your opinion.

383
00:27:15,117 --> 00:27:19,208
That's like asking a man
to testify against himself.

384
00:27:19,292 --> 00:27:24,218
Cathy, you have rare qualities.
You're direct, sincere, uncomplicated,

385
00:27:24,302 --> 00:27:28,268
the type of woman who brings out
the worst in a man - his conscience.

386
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh, I didn't mean
to make you uncomfortable.

387
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,528
It's rather disturbing.

388
00:27:33,612 --> 00:27:38,831
See, a man's conscience is generally
in direct opposition to his best interests.

389
00:27:38,915 --> 00:27:42,839
And, in your best interests,
I'd better disqualify myself.

390
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:45,135
So this has to be your decision.

391
00:27:48,601 --> 00:27:49,895
There's only one decision.

392
00:27:50,855 --> 00:27:55,531
Get a lawyer, blackmail him, get a potful of
money and go to Bermuda without him.

393
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:59,791
You're condemning him
without even knowing him. You really are.

394
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:03,548
You should've heard
him speak to the United Nations.

395
00:28:03,632 --> 00:28:07,598
Khrushchev spoke there too!
Would I let you go to Bermuda with him?

396
00:28:07,682 --> 00:28:10,061
Connie, how can you compare them?

397
00:28:10,145 --> 00:28:14,737
All I know is this, he did not try to lure me
to Bermuda or anywhere else.

398
00:28:14,822 --> 00:28:18,328
He was completely honest,
a perfect gentleman.

399
00:28:18,412 --> 00:28:22,754
A man meets you and in the same day
asks you to live with him?

400
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:26,554
I met a guy with a diamond stick pin
and a waxed moustache

401
00:28:26,636 --> 00:28:29,100
and even he waited until the second date.

402
00:28:29,183 --> 00:28:32,441
If he's a perfect gentleman,
waxed moustache is Albert Schweitzer.

403
00:28:32,524 --> 00:28:37,785
OK, answer me this - why didn't he try to
influence me when I asked for his advice?

404
00:28:37,868 --> 00:28:40,205
Because that's the way he operates.

405
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,423
Some guys ride the subways pinching girls,
he works out of a limousine.

406
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:45,925
But a pincher is a pincher.

407
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:49,768
Connie, I don't wanna hear
another word against him.

408
00:28:49,851 --> 00:28:52,814
OK, if that's the way you feel about it.

409
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,406
I tried.

410
00:28:58,327 --> 00:29:00,371
What's this?

411
00:29:02,376 --> 00:29:05,633
Some woman
in Mr Shayne's office gave it to me.

412
00:29:05,716 --> 00:29:08,347
Boy, has this guy got an organisation.

413
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,311
He even has a medical plan for his victims!

414
00:29:15,111 --> 00:29:17,156
Not another word.

415
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:46,966
Connie.

416
00:29:49,222 --> 00:29:51,477
- Connie.
- Hmm? Huh?

417
00:29:53,146 --> 00:29:54,775
What?

418
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:56,904
I think I'm in love.

419
00:29:57,614 --> 00:30:02,080
Try to get some sleep, honey,
you'll feel better in the morning.

420
00:30:17,445 --> 00:30:19,282
Connie?

421
00:30:20,034 --> 00:30:22,497
- Mmm?
- You sleeping?

422
00:30:28,802 --> 00:30:30,848
It's four o'clock.

423
00:30:30,931 --> 00:30:33,269
Why would I be sleeping?

424
00:30:35,148 --> 00:30:37,903
I've made a decision.

425
00:30:37,987 --> 00:30:40,033
I'm not gonna go with him.

426
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:42,163
It's for the best.

427
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:49,302
- Connie?
- Mmm?

428
00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,938
When he calls, how do I tell him no
without hurting his feelings?

429
00:30:59,573 --> 00:31:03,289
Call this number,
you'll get some good suggestions.

430
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:15,564
I wonder what shade of hair
I ought to wear this week.

431
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:18,654
I didn't do too well as a blonde.

432
00:31:18,737 --> 00:31:21,325
Raven. That wasn't bad.

433
00:31:21,408 --> 00:31:23,455
I got whistled at by a bird.

434
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:27,880
Grey. Maybe they'll feel sorry for me.

435
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:42,285
Look, if you don't know how to tell him,
when he calls I'll talk to him.

436
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:44,414
I'll talk to him.

437
00:31:44,498 --> 00:31:50,552
But I just want to say it in a way that he won't
think it any personal reflection on him.

438
00:31:50,634 --> 00:31:52,681
You're worried about him?

439
00:31:52,764 --> 00:31:55,478
Oh, boy, men really have this game beat.

440
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,361
For 2,000 years we have had their children,

441
00:31:59,445 --> 00:32:03,578
washed their clothes, cooked their meals
and cleaned their houses.

442
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:07,586
What do they give us in return?
The right to smoke in public.

443
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:09,716
We sold out for a cigarette.

444
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:11,845
And you don't even smoke.

445
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:16,145
Good morning, good morning!

446
00:32:16,229 --> 00:32:19,318
- It's a great day out.
- You're very happy, Roger.

447
00:32:19,402 --> 00:32:21,907
Check that with Dr Gruber,
it might be serious.

448
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:26,165
I had a wonderful night's rest.
I've solved the trouble I have sleeping.

449
00:32:26,248 --> 00:32:30,759
Just before you go to bed, put three
tranquillisers in a jigger of brandy.

450
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:34,349
You still can't sleep
but you're so relaxed you don't care.

451
00:32:34,432 --> 00:32:38,482
Fancy that. People who sleep
don't know what they're missing.

452
00:32:38,566 --> 00:32:42,366
Here's your chance to analyse
the Harrington report.

453
00:32:43,242 --> 00:32:46,457
- 'Yes, Mr Shayne? '
- Did you call Miss Timberlake yet?

454
00:32:46,541 --> 00:32:48,585
- 'No, sir.'
- Cancel it.

455
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:52,511
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yeah, the young lady from the automat.

456
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:54,849
- What happened with her?
- Nothing.

457
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:58,231
I've been wrestling
with my conscience all morning.

458
00:32:58,315 --> 00:33:00,360
- And I lost.
- That's an upset.

459
00:33:00,444 --> 00:33:02,990
Her mother's a teacher,
father's a druggist,

460
00:33:03,073 --> 00:33:05,955
brother's an eagle scout
and she sang in the church choir.

461
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:10,757
To take her to Bermuda is a desecration
of everything the Minutemen fought for.

462
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,053
- You asked her to go away with you?
- Yes.

463
00:33:13,136 --> 00:33:15,265
- But you're not gonna take her.
- No.

464
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:18,939
What a terrible thing to do to me.

465
00:33:19,023 --> 00:33:21,612
- To you?
- I've built this image of a man,

466
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:24,409
cold, ruthless, predatory,

467
00:33:24,492 --> 00:33:29,002
now you go do a decent thing like this
to destroy that image.

468
00:33:29,086 --> 00:33:31,800
You've set me back years in my analysis.

469
00:33:31,883 --> 00:33:33,720
Oh, I'm ashamed of myself.

470
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:39,272
Well, Roger, if I've done anything human,
I'll make it up to you.

471
00:33:40,483 --> 00:33:43,782
Would it help if I fired
every employee over 60?

472
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:45,912
No.

473
00:33:45,994 --> 00:33:50,379
Hey, wait a minute, take the wrapper off.
It's better that way.

474
00:33:52,048 --> 00:33:55,304
11:30. He said he'd call
first thing in the morning.

475
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:59,397
Well, now you don't have to worry
about not hurting his feelings.

476
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,822
At least he should give me the courtesy
of hurting his feelings.

477
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:07,413
A man picks you up off the street,
takes you to his office,

478
00:34:07,496 --> 00:34:11,171
makes you take your clothes off
and propositions you.

479
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:14,845
- What can you expect from a man like that?
- Respect.

480
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:18,728
Respect.
On that note of logic, I'll go to work.

481
00:34:18,811 --> 00:34:22,611
He should've had the decency to call
and get my answer.

482
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,111
Well, I'm not paying for you just to sit there.
Do something! Ring!

483
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,086
Hello?

484
00:34:51,169 --> 00:34:54,426
Yes, I'll talk to her. Hello, Cathy.

485
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:57,013
Weren't you supposed to call this morning?

486
00:34:57,098 --> 00:35:01,022
I'm sorry, I didn't think I should
under the circumstances.

487
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:03,444
What circumstances?

488
00:35:03,527 --> 00:35:05,574
Cathy, I came to a decision.

489
00:35:05,657 --> 00:35:08,955
I thought I was supposed
to make this decision.

490
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:11,586
Yes, but considering the situation.

491
00:35:11,669 --> 00:35:13,714
What situation?

492
00:35:13,798 --> 00:35:17,306
Well, I'm sure Upper Sandusky
is a delightful town

493
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:21,271
but it hardly prepares a girl
for this kind of situation.

494
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:24,945
I can see you don't know the girls
in Upper Sandusky.

495
00:35:25,029 --> 00:35:28,328
- They're always prepared.
- I'm sure they are.

496
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:30,958
We're not unsophisticated rustics.

497
00:35:31,042 --> 00:35:35,468
I'm not attacking you culturally. I'm sure
you have fine libraries and museums.

498
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:37,596
We also have a home for girls.

499
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,272
We may not be as large as New York
but we're just as progressive.

500
00:35:42,356 --> 00:35:44,778
Last year we had a scandal
at the country club...

501
00:35:44,861 --> 00:35:49,162
- I'm sure it's a zippy little community.
- Things are hoppin' up there!

502
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:54,089
I apologise. I should have called you
and given you the opportunity of saying no.

503
00:35:54,172 --> 00:35:58,389
- You certainly should have.
- And I respect that decision.

504
00:35:58,473 --> 00:36:00,893
- What decision?
- Not to go.

505
00:36:02,397 --> 00:36:06,447
I hate to disappoint you, Mr Shayne,
but the answer is yes!

506
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:09,620
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure!

507
00:36:09,704 --> 00:36:12,418
- Unless you're thinking of backing...
- No.

508
00:36:12,501 --> 00:36:16,008
I just suddenly see Upper Sandusky
in a new light.

509
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,599
- Will I be hearing from you?
- As soon as I make the arrangements.

510
00:36:19,682 --> 00:36:21,936
- Thank you.
- Thank you for calling.

511
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:25,736
Well, you heard. I tried to talk her out of it.

512
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,582
No, I brought her to throw money in your
face. I delivered the sparrow to the hawk.

513
00:36:31,665 --> 00:36:35,798
The sparrow's flying south. She'll need
clothes so make the arrangements.

514
00:36:35,882 --> 00:36:39,180
No. I will not dress the victim for sacrifice.

515
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:43,396
Bergdorf Goodman have a new line
of sacrificial evening gowns.

516
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:47,364
I have waited years to tell you
what you can do with your job,

517
00:36:47,447 --> 00:36:50,203
your salary, bonuses and fringe benefits.

518
00:36:50,286 --> 00:36:52,749
- Yes, Roger?
- I've waited this long.

519
00:36:52,832 --> 00:36:57,635
- And I can wait a little longer.
- Good. Wait over there, do it quietly.

520
00:36:58,595 --> 00:37:02,353
So he insulted Upper Sandusky,
this is no way to get even.

521
00:37:03,479 --> 00:37:06,026
You're carrying civic pride too far.

522
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,829
OK, if your mind's made up, fine.

523
00:37:10,911 --> 00:37:12,957
Send postcards.

524
00:37:14,627 --> 00:37:16,673
Well, he did it.

525
00:37:16,756 --> 00:37:18,803
Rasputin talked her into it.

526
00:37:22,853 --> 00:37:24,898
Connie, look.

527
00:37:47,903 --> 00:37:49,740
- Miss Timberlake?
- Yes.

528
00:37:49,823 --> 00:37:53,039
They're waiting for you
at Bergdorf Goodman.

529
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:56,546
- Who are you?
- Leonard. I'm assigned as coordinator.

530
00:37:58,007 --> 00:38:00,680
Oh? What do you coordinate?

531
00:38:00,763 --> 00:38:02,600
You.

532
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:06,143
Thank you very much.

533
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:11,445
Oh, Connie, please stop crying.

534
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,742
I'm only going around the world.

535
00:40:14,535 --> 00:40:16,581
I know.

536
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:21,424
Oh, Cathy, you look so beautiful.

537
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,806
Just like a bride.

538
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:26,936
Oh, I'm sorry!

539
00:40:27,018 --> 00:40:29,899
Oh, Connie, I'm all right, really I am.

540
00:40:31,069 --> 00:40:34,325
What can happen to me?

541
00:40:35,703 --> 00:40:37,748
Oh, Connie, please, stop.

542
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,546
Connie.

543
00:40:40,629 --> 00:40:42,676
Please?

544
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:47,643
I'm all right now.

545
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:50,942
Oh, Cathy, have a good trip.

546
00:40:51,026 --> 00:40:54,825
Oh, I will. I'll write to you
as soon as I get to Bermuda.

547
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,209
Oh, Cathy, you look lovely in that coat.

548
00:41:00,086 --> 00:41:02,633
You mother would be so proud of you...

549
00:41:02,716 --> 00:41:04,970
Oh, I'm so sorry!

550
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:11,567
- Bye.
- Bye.

551
00:41:13,948 --> 00:41:15,993
Enjoy yourself.

552
00:41:17,246 --> 00:41:19,291
I think.

553
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,536
When she said she'd throw that money
in his face she became a symbol of hope.

554
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:38,665
Look at her.

555
00:41:38,748 --> 00:41:42,506
It's like watching Joan of Arc
on her way to the fire.

556
00:41:47,266 --> 00:41:50,397
'Good morning, welcome aboard flight 603.

557
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,908
'This is your pilot, Captain Miller.
Your copilot is Captain Saunders.

558
00:41:55,992 --> 00:42:00,667
'We will be cruising at 31,000 feet
at an average speed of 500 miles an hour.

559
00:42:00,752 --> 00:42:03,298
'We hope you will have a pleasant trip.'

560
00:42:07,264 --> 00:42:10,146
- Are you comfortable, Miss Timberlake?
- Yes, thank you.

561
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:14,362
Is this the off season for Bermuda.
No, we're booked solid.

562
00:42:14,445 --> 00:42:16,492
Mr Shayne bought every seat.

563
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:21,919
Oh! It's all right.

564
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:02,711
Cathy, you're too much.
Here, let me take this.

565
00:43:02,794 --> 00:43:05,382
Mr Shayne, everything was so expensive.

566
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:08,681
I told Leonard not to spend so much
but he insisted.

567
00:43:08,765 --> 00:43:11,520
- Who's Leonard?
- He works for you.

568
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:13,942
- Oh, he does?
- He coordinated me.

569
00:43:14,026 --> 00:43:16,488
You know, he sort of put me together.

570
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:21,290
Well, no reflection on Leonard
but he merely put a frame on a Renoir.

571
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,740
Here's your key, Mr Shayne.

572
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,497
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

573
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:07,213
Come along.

574
00:45:19,322 --> 00:45:21,367
Stand there.

575
00:45:21,451 --> 00:45:23,497
Don't move, don't go away.

576
00:45:29,175 --> 00:45:33,308
Nowhere else in the world can you see
beaches with pink sand.

577
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:36,189
Pirate ships used to anchor in that cove.

578
00:45:36,272 --> 00:45:41,575
Only pirates from the best families,
naturally. The others couldn't afford it.

579
00:45:51,888 --> 00:45:55,437
There's the kitchen
in case you get hungry in the night.

580
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:58,444
Oh, no. Once I get in bed I'm through.

581
00:45:58,526 --> 00:46:00,573
I sleep like a rock.

582
00:46:00,656 --> 00:46:04,372
I wish I had that faculty.
Takes me hours to get to sleep.

583
00:46:04,456 --> 00:46:06,836
Have you tried hot milk and butter?

584
00:46:06,918 --> 00:46:09,214
No, I'm not that anxious to sleep.

585
00:46:17,815 --> 00:46:20,822
I want you to look at something.

586
00:46:20,905 --> 00:46:23,661
Have you ever seen anything like that?

587
00:46:24,914 --> 00:46:26,333
No.

588
00:46:26,417 --> 00:46:30,299
It means so much more
when you can share it with someone.

589
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:34,558
How long will it take you to get ready?

590
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:36,687
- For what?
- A swim.

591
00:46:36,771 --> 00:46:39,234
Shall we go to the pool? Can you swim?

592
00:46:39,318 --> 00:46:41,989
Oh, swim! That I can do.

593
00:46:42,074 --> 00:46:45,038
If you'd like to change,
I'll wait on the balcony.

594
00:46:45,121 --> 00:46:49,631
No. A gentleman always allows
the lady to undress first.

595
00:47:12,427 --> 00:47:14,472
'She knows.'

596
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:40,192
'They know.'

597
00:48:00,817 --> 00:48:02,862
'Everybody knows! '

598
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:24,115
I want to thank you for a wonderful day.

599
00:48:24,197 --> 00:48:27,371
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.
- Will I see you tomorrow?

600
00:48:27,454 --> 00:48:29,291
I imagine so.

601
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,421
Good. Good night.

602
00:48:38,978 --> 00:48:41,066
I think I'm registered here.

603
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:43,403
Oh.

604
00:49:05,323 --> 00:49:07,369
Is there anything you'd like?

605
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:10,083
How about a late movie?

606
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:13,339
All the theatres are closed.

607
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:17,974
- We can watch one on television.
- There is no television.

608
00:49:20,938 --> 00:49:23,777
What do people do here at night?

609
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:28,997
I mean, um, for entertainment.

610
00:49:29,956 --> 00:49:31,668
I mean, um...

611
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,886
to... pass the time.

612
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:39,351
They make up games, Cathy.

613
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,772
Simple, fun games.

614
00:49:45,196 --> 00:49:47,241
Come over here.

615
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:52,586
Sit down.

616
00:49:54,715 --> 00:49:57,512
Cathy, this is a very special place to me.

617
00:49:57,596 --> 00:50:00,227
I've never brought a girl here before.

618
00:50:00,309 --> 00:50:02,690
You're not sorry you came, are you?

619
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:09,538
What are you doing?

620
00:50:09,621 --> 00:50:11,666
I'm kissing you. Do you mind?

621
00:50:12,377 --> 00:50:14,422
Not if you don't.

622
00:50:15,257 --> 00:50:18,973
Well, relax. I'll keep you informed
of my every move.

623
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:23,399
You have a beautiful back.

624
00:50:23,482 --> 00:50:26,112
My mother always made me sit up straight.

625
00:50:26,196 --> 00:50:28,242
I'm grateful to your mother.

626
00:50:28,324 --> 00:50:30,538
And such attractive shoulders.

627
00:50:31,205 --> 00:50:34,087
Swimming was compulsory at high school.

628
00:50:34,171 --> 00:50:37,052
I'm grateful to the public school system.

629
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:40,183
There's so much to be grateful for.

630
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:42,563
And so little time to be grateful.

631
00:51:06,946 --> 00:51:11,705
Oh, I just remembered - I forgot
my toothbrush. I'd better go back for it.

632
00:51:12,457 --> 00:51:14,503
I always carry a spare.

633
00:51:14,585 --> 00:51:17,466
But it takes me months
to break in a new one.

634
00:51:17,551 --> 00:51:21,935
The Hindus use twigs,
they break them off the trees. We'll try that.

635
00:51:22,017 --> 00:51:25,233
- I'm going for a short walk.
- I'll go with you!

636
00:51:25,315 --> 00:51:27,529
Stay here. Make yourself comfortable.

637
00:51:27,612 --> 00:51:31,203
Philip! There's something
you should know about me.

638
00:51:31,287 --> 00:51:33,584
I have an uncle who's a socialist.

639
00:51:33,666 --> 00:51:38,635
I respect you for telling me
but what we have transcends all politics.

640
00:52:02,141 --> 00:52:05,147
- Hi.
- Hello.

641
00:52:05,231 --> 00:52:08,196
Er, my name's Harry Clark.

642
00:52:09,322 --> 00:52:11,576
Philip Shayne.

643
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,794
I just got married this afternoon.

644
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:18,967
Congratulations.
How do you like married life?

645
00:52:19,050 --> 00:52:20,805
I don't know yet.

646
00:52:25,272 --> 00:52:27,317
I, er, came out for a smoke.

647
00:52:28,696 --> 00:52:32,286
I thought I'd give Marie-Anne
some time to, er...

648
00:52:34,248 --> 00:52:38,382
Well, what is a decent interval
for a fella to stay away?

649
00:52:38,465 --> 00:52:40,636
How long have you been out here?

650
00:52:41,763 --> 00:52:44,979
- Two hours.
- That's as decent as you can get.

651
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:48,194
Marie-Anne's kinda shy.

652
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:54,247
I mean, psychologically,
I want her to feel secure.

653
00:52:55,124 --> 00:52:57,170
Harry?

654
00:52:58,632 --> 00:53:00,802
She sounds secure.

655
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:04,227
Well, awfully nice to have met you.
G- Good night.

656
00:53:22,596 --> 00:53:24,726
Oh, good evening.

657
00:53:24,809 --> 00:53:26,855
Good evening.

658
00:53:29,903 --> 00:53:34,538
- Do we know each other?
- I'm Dr Richardson, the hotel physician.

659
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:36,959
- Oh.
- I wouldn't go in just yet.

660
00:53:37,042 --> 00:53:41,093
- What happened?
- The lady called to ask if we'd any sedatives

661
00:53:41,175 --> 00:53:43,806
and she sounded agitated so I came up.

662
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:47,772
- Is she all right?
- Nothing serious, just a case of nerves.

663
00:53:48,984 --> 00:53:52,032
May I ask a personal question, Mr Shayne?

664
00:53:52,115 --> 00:53:55,413
- Sure, go ahead.
- Is that Mrs Shayne in there?

665
00:53:55,497 --> 00:53:57,208
Er...

666
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:58,962
no.

667
00:53:59,046 --> 00:54:03,847
That's strange, this reaction
is more common amongst married women.

668
00:54:10,402 --> 00:54:12,615
- Is he back yet?
- Yes.

669
00:54:12,698 --> 00:54:16,456
Don't let him come in!
I don't want him to see me like this.

670
00:54:16,539 --> 00:54:18,251
I won't.

671
00:54:18,335 --> 00:54:21,049
All of a sudden I started breaking out.

672
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,641
I always get rashes when I'm nervous.

673
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:28,146
The ointment will take care of that.

674
00:54:28,231 --> 00:54:30,275
Here, take this.

675
00:54:35,077 --> 00:54:38,208
And get some sleep.
I'll stop by in the morning.

676
00:54:38,292 --> 00:54:41,841
Thank you. Oh, Doctor!
Don't tell him about the rash.

677
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:46,309
- Tell him I had a stroke or something.
- I'll be discreet.

678
00:54:47,227 --> 00:54:48,731
Oh!

679
00:54:52,321 --> 00:54:55,703
- How is she?
- Fine. Needs a good night's rest.

680
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:57,665
Uninterrupted.

681
00:54:57,748 --> 00:54:59,209
Naturally.

682
00:54:59,293 --> 00:55:02,675
Had a case in 207 last week,
honeymoon couple.

683
00:55:02,759 --> 00:55:06,058
Lovely girl, barricaded herself
in the bathroom.

684
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,356
Claimed her husband
was making advances toward her.

685
00:55:09,438 --> 00:55:13,697
- The man should be horsewhipped.
- They're just not prepared.

686
00:55:13,781 --> 00:55:16,828
We give them one semester
of home economics

687
00:55:16,912 --> 00:55:19,376
and expect Madame DuBarry.

688
00:55:32,235 --> 00:55:34,280
Mr Shayne?

689
00:55:36,536 --> 00:55:38,080
Yes, Cathy?

690
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:41,504
- Mr Shayne, I'm sorry.
- You couldn't help it.

691
00:55:41,587 --> 00:55:45,846
But I don't want to ruin your evening.
You go out without me.

692
00:55:45,929 --> 00:55:47,851
It wouldn't be the same.

693
00:55:47,934 --> 00:55:51,065
Don't worry. We'll go back
to New York in the morning.

694
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:53,654
I know you've gone to great expense.

695
00:55:53,737 --> 00:55:57,035
Plane, hotels, meals, tips...

696
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,126
If you add it all up,
I'll be glad to pay half of it.

697
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:02,588
We'll figure it out in the morning.

698
00:56:02,672 --> 00:56:06,221
Now, you get a good night's sleep,
I'll be on the couch.

699
00:56:06,305 --> 00:56:09,102
If you wake up and need anything,
just call me.

700
00:56:09,185 --> 00:56:12,192
I won't wake up.
Once I get in bed, I'm through.

701
00:56:12,275 --> 00:56:13,987
Yes, I know.

702
00:56:14,071 --> 00:56:16,951
- Will you be all right on the couch?
- Fine!

703
00:56:17,035 --> 00:56:22,171
If you have trouble falling asleep,
don't forget the hot milk and butter.

704
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,299
This may be the night for it.

705
00:56:25,677 --> 00:56:28,265
- Good night.
- Good night.

706
00:56:29,477 --> 00:56:32,233
- Oh, Mr Shayne!
- Yes, Cathy?

707
00:56:33,693 --> 00:56:37,368
I just want you to know that, sick as I am,

708
00:56:37,451 --> 00:56:40,792
this has been
the most wonderful day of my life.

709
00:56:40,874 --> 00:56:42,712
I'll never forget it.

710
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:45,885
Neither will I.

711
00:57:18,284 --> 00:57:20,371
Having trouble, too, huh?

712
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:21,750
Well...

713
00:57:21,833 --> 00:57:25,883
Before you give them the mink coat
they all talk a big game.

714
00:57:25,966 --> 00:57:29,724
Now the lady gets headaches,
she prefers to be alone.

715
00:57:30,935 --> 00:57:33,857
- What did you do?
- I belted her.

716
00:57:33,942 --> 00:57:35,986
How about you?

717
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,116
Right across the chops.

718
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,082
- We got a lot in common.
- We could pass for brothers.

719
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,338
Deal the cards.

720
00:57:46,676 --> 00:57:48,930
- Watch it, I cheat.
- So do I.

721
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:56,528
And in view of its growth potential, I strongly
recommend purchase of said stock.

722
00:57:56,612 --> 00:58:00,537
Send a copy to Mr Shayne,
Victoria Hotel, Bermuda.

723
00:58:00,620 --> 00:58:03,376
- Yes, sir.
- Just a moment, Miss Jones.

724
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:08,678
I've been very curious about
something for years.

725
00:58:08,761 --> 00:58:11,559
- Would you let your hair down?
- What?

726
00:58:11,642 --> 00:58:13,689
Let your hair down.

727
00:58:22,039 --> 00:58:24,294
Now take your glasses off.

728
00:58:27,550 --> 00:58:30,806
Strange, always seems to work
in the movies.

729
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:37,028
- Miss Jones, do you see what I see?
- Where?

730
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:40,868
It's a miracle. Joan of Arc put out the fire.

731
00:58:50,931 --> 00:58:53,812
- Things went pretty badly?
- Pretty badly.

732
00:58:53,896 --> 00:58:57,193
- It was a disaster?
- That's what I like about you,

733
00:58:57,277 --> 00:59:01,327
no matter what calamity befalls others,
you can still laugh about it.

734
00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:06,421
It's a victory for the little people. How often
does the sparrow down the hawk?

735
00:59:06,505 --> 00:59:09,594
The baron of the boudoir
shot down over Bermuda.

736
00:59:09,678 --> 00:59:13,853
- It had to happen sooner or later.
- I knew she was no ordinary woman.

737
00:59:13,936 --> 00:59:17,401
- She proved that all right.
- Something about her,

738
00:59:17,485 --> 00:59:19,489
purity, innocence, honour.

739
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:24,082
- All virtues that drive a man to drink.
- What a lift this is for me.

740
00:59:24,166 --> 00:59:27,672
There'll be dancing in
Dr Gruber's office today.

741
00:59:29,176 --> 00:59:33,852
Excuse me, sir. Miss Timberlake
asked me to return these things to you.

742
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:35,939
Thank you, Collins.

743
00:59:36,022 --> 00:59:38,527
Why do that?
Why didn't she just keep them?

744
00:59:38,612 --> 00:59:40,406
It upsets you, doesn't it?

745
00:59:40,491 --> 00:59:45,626
The puppet master ran across a puppet who
won't perform and then cuts all his strings.

746
00:59:45,709 --> 00:59:50,386
She's become a symbol of hope to
all of us who sold out for that touch of mink.

747
00:59:50,468 --> 00:59:51,846
Roger!

748
00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,354
You give us good salaries,
paid vacations, insurance,

749
00:59:55,437 --> 00:59:59,153
you take away our problems
and act like you've done us a favour.

750
00:59:59,237 --> 01:00:02,494
Well, you haven't
and some day there'll be an uprising

751
01:00:02,576 --> 01:00:06,167
and the masses will regain
the misery they're entitled to.

752
01:00:06,252 --> 01:00:10,802
Neurotics of the world unite. You have
nothing to lose but your psychiatrist.

753
01:00:10,885 --> 01:00:15,145
Roger, I flew 800 miles
to a tropical paradise

754
01:00:15,227 --> 01:00:17,274
to drink hot milk and butter.

755
01:00:17,357 --> 01:00:22,409
I spent half the night playing gin rummy
with a bookie. Not a memorable evening.

756
01:00:22,492 --> 01:00:25,415
If you don't leave now, I'll raise your salary.

757
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,712
You're sadistic enough to do that.

758
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:31,092
If Miss Timberlake is your hope,
you get together with her.

759
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:34,601
You, she and Dr Gruber
will make a lovely couple.

760
01:00:48,419 --> 01:00:53,305
You go back home for a few days
and see your family, you'll feel better.

761
01:00:54,265 --> 01:00:57,564
I don't want to feel better. I don't deserve it.

762
01:00:58,691 --> 01:01:03,492
I was afraid of him.
I thought I wasn't good enough for him.

763
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,747
Afraid I'd disappoint him.

764
01:01:05,831 --> 01:01:09,504
So? You weren't asking for
a letter of recommendation.

765
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:13,430
The minute he bolted that door I got panicky.

766
01:01:13,512 --> 01:01:17,479
Of course. You're alone in a hotel room
with a strange man,

767
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:19,817
what would the average girl do?

768
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:25,287
Forget about the average girl, somebody as
sensitive as you are is bound to get nervous.

769
01:01:25,370 --> 01:01:29,086
Nervous? I broke out in a rash.

770
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:31,048
I know, I know.

771
01:01:31,132 --> 01:01:33,888
I had exactly the same experience once.

772
01:01:33,971 --> 01:01:39,023
This fellow and I stopped off
at a roadside inn - never forget it.

773
01:01:39,107 --> 01:01:42,280
Started shaking like a leaf,
broke out in boils.

774
01:01:42,363 --> 01:01:46,204
He was so sick I had to drive him home.
It happens to everybody.

775
01:01:47,332 --> 01:01:49,544
He was so understanding about it.

776
01:01:49,628 --> 01:01:51,673
He didn't even get upset.

777
01:01:52,801 --> 01:01:54,847
He just smiled.

778
01:01:54,931 --> 01:01:57,394
It was so awful!

779
01:01:57,477 --> 01:02:00,274
If only he'd got mad or yelled or hit me.

780
01:02:00,358 --> 01:02:04,491
- Men are so inconsiderate.
- And all that money he spent on me,

781
01:02:04,574 --> 01:02:07,498
he can't even deduct it, it's humiliating.

782
01:02:07,581 --> 01:02:08,917
What is?

783
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:13,008
I'm not even important enough
to be a tax loss.

784
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:21,860
- Good morning, Roger.
- Morning, Doctor.

785
01:02:25,534 --> 01:02:27,455
It's good to be home.

786
01:02:27,538 --> 01:02:30,962
How are things in the investment world?
Any good tips?

787
01:02:31,045 --> 01:02:35,680
A new stock issue, Consolidated Wire.
It's a great buy if you get in fast.

788
01:02:35,763 --> 01:02:41,442
I still haven't heard from my mother, not that
it bothers me but it has been two days.

789
01:02:41,525 --> 01:02:45,742
I know what's wrong, she's in a snit.
I forgot Grandpa's birthday.

790
01:02:45,825 --> 01:02:48,456
She has a real problem with her father.

791
01:02:48,539 --> 01:02:50,752
Let her analyst worry about that.

792
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:56,223
Doc, an exciting thing happened,
I think I'm about to make a breakthrough.

793
01:02:57,475 --> 01:03:01,316
I made a great discovery,
Philip Shayne is just a man!

794
01:03:01,398 --> 01:03:03,444
It took a woman to prove it.

795
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:08,580
There's this girl, let's call her...
Cathy Timberlake...

796
01:03:08,664 --> 01:03:13,047
Walter? Dr Gruber.
What's Consolidated Wire?

797
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:16,303
12 and a half.

798
01:03:16,388 --> 01:03:18,517
Buy me... 500 shares.

799
01:03:19,644 --> 01:03:21,940
Yes, I got it from the usual source.

800
01:03:22,024 --> 01:03:24,989
The way she stood up to him was inspiring.

801
01:03:25,072 --> 01:03:29,290
I kept thinking what would I have done
if I were in her shoes.

802
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:31,418
Unemployed, no money.

803
01:03:33,756 --> 01:03:38,056
This very wealthy man
sees me walking down the street,

804
01:03:38,141 --> 01:03:40,645
he's terribly attracted to me.

805
01:03:40,729 --> 01:03:45,447
Had me brought up to his office,
I have to admit he's quite charming.

806
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:49,121
After the usual preliminaries -
dinner and dancing -

807
01:03:49,205 --> 01:03:52,629
- he invites me to Bermuda.
- Just like that?

808
01:03:52,712 --> 01:03:56,887
This is a forceful man,
accustomed to getting his own way.

809
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,557
Uh-huh.

810
01:03:58,641 --> 01:04:02,023
Get given a complete wardrobe,
including a mink coat,

811
01:04:02,105 --> 01:04:06,949
flown to Bermuda, taken to the best suite,
this man offers everything.

812
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:09,329
Excitement, comfort, security.

813
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:13,212
Believe me, Doc, it's not easy
to turn down an offer like that.

814
01:04:13,294 --> 01:04:15,341
No, it's not.

815
01:04:15,424 --> 01:04:18,305
Roger, something
quite urgent has come up.

816
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:21,562
- Would you mind cutting the session short?
- No.

817
01:04:21,646 --> 01:04:25,486
I want to see you in the morning.
We should examine this new development.

818
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:28,535
- Exciting, isn't it?
- Yes, that's...

819
01:04:28,618 --> 01:04:30,957
quite a breakthrough you've made.

820
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:35,799
Walter, Dr Gruber.
Cancel that order for Consolidated Wire.

821
01:04:35,882 --> 01:04:41,268
My informant has developed instabilities
which make his judgement questionable.

822
01:04:43,188 --> 01:04:45,652
Tell me when you're coming back
and I'll meet you.

823
01:04:45,736 --> 01:04:51,205
- I will. Better hurry, you'll be late for work.
- I know. Have a good trip. Bye.

824
01:04:59,013 --> 01:05:01,017
Bye.

825
01:05:02,145 --> 01:05:05,567
Cathy! How did you miss the bus?
You were on it.

826
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,530
I've changed my mind.

827
01:05:07,614 --> 01:05:10,955
- We can still catch it.
- I've got to go back there.

828
01:05:11,038 --> 01:05:15,714
You are the husband, four children
and a cottage type, this isn't you.

829
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:18,804
You got lucky once,
it may not be a rash this time.

830
01:05:18,887 --> 01:05:23,981
I can't let him think of me as I was last night.
I want him to remember me as a woman.

831
01:05:24,064 --> 01:05:27,780
It's important to me,
I've got to prove to him I'm a woman.

832
01:05:27,863 --> 01:05:30,536
There are easier ways to prove it.

833
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:32,665
Send him your birth certificate.

834
01:05:36,631 --> 01:05:41,391
Mr Shayne, a long-distance phone call.
It came through from your office.

835
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:43,813
- Who is it? Do you know?
- No, sir.

836
01:05:43,895 --> 01:05:45,984
All right. Thank you, Mario.

837
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:50,576
- Hello?
- Philip, this is Cathy.

838
01:05:51,746 --> 01:05:53,791
'Guess where I am.'

839
01:05:53,875 --> 01:05:55,378
Disneyland?

840
01:05:55,462 --> 01:05:59,010
Bermuda. At the hotel.

841
01:05:59,094 --> 01:06:00,889
What are you doing there?

842
01:06:00,973 --> 01:06:03,311
Waiting for you.

843
01:06:04,521 --> 01:06:09,281
I already have plans for the evening.
I have a few things to catch up on.

844
01:06:09,365 --> 01:06:12,496
You could be here in two hours.

845
01:06:12,579 --> 01:06:16,087
And I have a board meeting early tomorrow.

846
01:06:20,303 --> 01:06:23,852
Is that what you'd rather see
first thing in the morning?

847
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:29,656
That is something to think about.

848
01:06:29,739 --> 01:06:33,080
And it's all just two hours away.

849
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,208
Er, just a minute.

850
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:39,592
Isabella, I have
a hypothetical question to ask you.

851
01:06:39,676 --> 01:06:43,977
Darling, what would you do
if the situation were reversed?

852
01:06:44,059 --> 01:06:45,856
Grazie.

853
01:06:45,938 --> 01:06:47,817
I'm on my way.

854
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:06,647
Sorry to keep you this late
but just one more letter.

855
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:10,489
To the Dean of Economics Department,
Princeton University.

856
01:07:10,573 --> 01:07:13,328
Dear Arnold, after an absence of six years

857
01:07:13,412 --> 01:07:17,796
I'm happy to announce I will soon be
returning to the academic world.

858
01:07:17,879 --> 01:07:22,263
It is my intention to fill the void
created by my leaving...

859
01:07:22,346 --> 01:07:24,434
- Oh, Collins.
- Yes, sir?

860
01:07:24,518 --> 01:07:27,816
- Taking everything back?
- Oh, no, the airport.

861
01:07:27,900 --> 01:07:32,576
Mr Shayne is flying to Bermuda.
He's meeting Miss Timberlake.

862
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:34,496
Oh.

863
01:07:34,579 --> 01:07:36,625
Thank you.

864
01:07:45,894 --> 01:07:50,027
Thank you, Miss Jones.
We'll finish in the morning.

865
01:07:50,111 --> 01:07:52,365
- Good night.
- Good night.

866
01:07:56,624 --> 01:08:01,384
Dr Gruber? Roger. I hate to bother you
but something's come up.

867
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:04,683
- Remember what I told you this morning?
- 'Yes.'

868
01:08:04,766 --> 01:08:07,939
- It's happening again.
- 'A trip to Bermuda? '

869
01:08:08,023 --> 01:08:09,860
Yes, tonight.

870
01:08:22,134 --> 01:08:24,389
You don't scare me.

871
01:08:56,538 --> 01:08:59,544
- Good evening, Mr Shayne.
- Good evening.

872
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:16,954
Cathy.

873
01:09:24,762 --> 01:09:26,265
Cathy?

874
01:09:26,807 --> 01:09:28,186
Cathy.

875
01:09:33,571 --> 01:09:35,617
Cathy!

876
01:09:37,162 --> 01:09:39,208
Hi!

877
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:49,521
See... no rash.

878
01:09:52,443 --> 01:09:54,489
Well, that's something.

879
01:10:01,504 --> 01:10:03,967
Cathy. Cathy...

880
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:07,265
Cathy! Did you drink this whole bottle?

881
01:10:07,348 --> 01:10:09,437
Beats hot milk and butter.

882
01:10:09,519 --> 01:10:11,733
Oh, for...

883
01:10:11,815 --> 01:10:13,862
Come on, girl. Come on.

884
01:10:13,945 --> 01:10:15,992
Come on, let's sit up.

885
01:10:16,074 --> 01:10:18,913
There's a good girl. Sit up. That's right.

886
01:10:20,042 --> 01:10:23,548
- Are you glad you came here?
- Delighted. Come on.

887
01:10:23,632 --> 01:10:26,554
I bet you never expected
to hear from me again.

888
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,767
Oh, I had a premonition.

889
01:10:28,851 --> 01:10:30,897
- Can you stand up?
- Yeah!

890
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:32,984
Good.

891
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:38,119
- I'm a real woman, huh?
- Yeah, irresistible.

892
01:10:38,203 --> 01:10:40,249
Now, try to walk.

893
01:10:40,332 --> 01:10:42,462
That's the idea.

894
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:44,841
There you are, that's right.

895
01:10:46,094 --> 01:10:48,516
Do you like the way I walk?

896
01:10:48,599 --> 01:10:50,770
You're poetry in motion.

897
01:10:50,854 --> 01:10:53,234
- I learned when I was a baby.
- Uh-huh.

898
01:10:53,317 --> 01:10:55,656
- I been walking for years.
- Oh.

899
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,995
Oh, dear.

900
01:11:00,873 --> 01:11:04,131
- Have you been drinking?
- Not yet.

901
01:11:04,214 --> 01:11:06,636
Right, come on.

902
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:11,270
There. Now, just stand there, don't move.

903
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:14,443
Are you nervous?

904
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:17,366
Petrified.

905
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:21,624
Now, take a breath of fresh air.
Come on, take a deep breath.

906
01:11:24,255 --> 01:11:26,802
Is that good? Fine... Oop!

907
01:11:26,886 --> 01:11:29,474
Now, just stand there. That's right.

908
01:11:30,977 --> 01:11:33,775
I'll call down and get some coffee.

909
01:11:33,858 --> 01:11:35,945
Room service, please. Hurry.

910
01:11:37,073 --> 01:11:41,498
Hello, this is Philip Shayne.
Send up some hot coffee right away.

911
01:11:41,582 --> 01:11:43,628
As much as you can carry.

912
01:11:43,711 --> 01:11:46,885
I need a chaser for a fifth of Scotch. Yes, I...

913
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,782
Don't move! Lie there.

914
01:11:57,864 --> 01:11:59,743
Oh, dear.

915
01:12:05,046 --> 01:12:08,972
I fell out of Mr Shayne's suite.
See that I'm returned.

916
01:12:09,054 --> 01:12:13,731
Luckily, the canopy broke her fall.
Nothing but a sprained wrist.

917
01:12:13,814 --> 01:12:17,697
- Where's Mr Shayne?
- Wandered off. Seems to be in shock.

918
01:12:17,781 --> 01:12:21,621
Can't say I blame him,
the girl's hysterical one evening

919
01:12:21,705 --> 01:12:24,169
and plunges off his balcony the next.

920
01:12:24,252 --> 01:12:28,218
Their relationship does
leave something to be desired.

921
01:12:30,724 --> 01:12:32,978
- Hi.
- Hi.

922
01:12:36,568 --> 01:12:40,118
- I thought you left this morning.
- I did. Flew back.

923
01:12:40,202 --> 01:12:42,414
How's the little lady?

924
01:12:42,498 --> 01:12:44,920
Got another headache. How's yours?

925
01:12:45,002 --> 01:12:47,007
Got loaded. Fell off the balcony.

926
01:12:47,091 --> 01:12:50,848
I'm glad I book horses.
Who can handicap women?

927
01:12:50,932 --> 01:12:53,771
- Can't win.
- Why do we keep betting on them?

928
01:12:53,853 --> 01:12:58,321
It's like Adam said about Eve -
"It's better than apples."

929
01:12:58,405 --> 01:13:00,576
- Isn't it?
- Yeah.

930
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,704
Deal the cards.

931
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:11,139
Thank you. Miss Jones, look!

932
01:13:14,896 --> 01:13:17,110
The hawk has crashed again.

933
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:23,330
Call Dr Gruber. Cancel my appointment.
Tell him things worked out well in Bermuda.

934
01:13:23,414 --> 01:13:28,550
You can't just sit there for
the rest of your life staring out the window.

935
01:13:29,844 --> 01:13:34,312
Catherine, darling, look.
I've baked you a kugel. Eat.

936
01:13:34,395 --> 01:13:36,398
You need strength to suffer.

937
01:13:36,483 --> 01:13:39,237
Believe me, no man is worth it.

938
01:13:39,322 --> 01:13:43,580
You'll see, you'll get a job, work for 20 years

939
01:13:43,664 --> 01:13:46,669
and then you'll get a pension,
who needs him?

940
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:50,637
Well, say something.

941
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:53,183
I just wanna die.

942
01:13:54,478 --> 01:13:59,654
- Did you hear that? She wants to die.
- Maybe it'll make her feel better.

943
01:14:01,952 --> 01:14:03,996
No, no. Don't call one.

944
01:14:05,332 --> 01:14:10,635
We better wait. I had a traumatic experience
driving in the rain the other day.

945
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,519
- Anything serious?
- No, just left me a little puddle-shy.

946
01:14:14,601 --> 01:14:16,647
Let me ask you a question.

947
01:14:16,731 --> 01:14:20,071
If you saw a stray kitten,
helpless but very appealing,

948
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:24,330
and every time you tried to pet it
you got scratched, would you avoid it?

949
01:14:24,413 --> 01:14:27,545
- Naturally.
- Yet you can't leave it to starve,

950
01:14:27,628 --> 01:14:30,926
you've got a moral obligation
to help it survive.

951
01:14:31,010 --> 01:14:34,893
- What does this kitten do?
- Works a computing machine.

952
01:14:34,977 --> 01:14:38,776
We own American Credit Card,
they use those machines.

953
01:14:38,859 --> 01:14:41,740
Arrange for a job but keep my name out of it.

954
01:14:41,823 --> 01:14:45,790
- How do we contact this kitten?
- With extreme caution.

955
01:14:47,252 --> 01:14:52,053
Don't worry, you go to work.
I'll check and see that she's all right.

956
01:14:52,136 --> 01:14:54,725
Boy, if I ever run across him again.

957
01:15:10,048 --> 01:15:13,471
- Excuse me, could you tell me...
- With pleasure.

958
01:15:24,869 --> 01:15:27,082
- What's wrong?
- It's him.

959
01:15:27,165 --> 01:15:29,212
You...!

960
01:15:37,938 --> 01:15:39,608
What happened?

961
01:15:39,691 --> 01:15:42,238
Don't ask, get Herman.

962
01:15:42,323 --> 01:15:44,952
Herman. Herman!

963
01:15:45,036 --> 01:15:47,165
Herman, come here.

964
01:15:47,248 --> 01:15:48,668
Get him!

965
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:05,035
What happened?

966
01:16:05,118 --> 01:16:09,251
I was knocked down two flights of stairs
and attacked by a dog.

967
01:16:10,587 --> 01:16:13,677
This has been the
most satisfying day of my life.

968
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:15,514
What started it?

969
01:16:15,597 --> 01:16:19,564
When the cab crashed and
the women started hitting me, I found out.

970
01:16:19,648 --> 01:16:23,572
They had nothing against me,
they thought they were hitting you.

971
01:16:23,656 --> 01:16:28,082
Before I go to the hospital I wanted you
to see what people think of you.

972
01:16:28,164 --> 01:16:30,586
And you deserved everything I got.

973
01:16:35,471 --> 01:16:37,517
I wonder what I've done.

974
01:16:39,271 --> 01:16:41,191
The whole world's on credit

975
01:16:41,275 --> 01:16:46,076
and I'm going with a man who won't
get married till he can pay for it in cash.

976
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:50,919
I told him people charge everything -
hotels, department stores.

977
01:16:51,003 --> 01:16:53,424
Some places won't even take money.

978
01:16:53,508 --> 01:16:57,767
One of these days they'll even
charge funerals - die now, pay later.

979
01:17:03,529 --> 01:17:07,828
Stanley's cousin's in town.
We could make it a foursome tonight.

980
01:17:07,912 --> 01:17:12,422
Thanks, but I have to start billing
the New England area tomorrow.

981
01:17:12,505 --> 01:17:15,135
I need to memorise these code numbers.

982
01:17:15,220 --> 01:17:19,436
Well, that'll be more interesting
than Stanley's cousin.

983
01:17:19,519 --> 01:17:21,816
- See you in the morning.
- Night.

984
01:17:24,738 --> 01:17:27,744
How do you like working here,
Miss Timberlake?

985
01:17:27,829 --> 01:17:30,375
Fine, thank you. I just hope I do well.

986
01:17:30,458 --> 01:17:35,427
And if you don't, who's going to fire you?
My friend works in personnel.

987
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:40,520
When the call came from Mr Shayne's
office to hire you it was like panicsville.

988
01:17:40,603 --> 01:17:44,111
Have you ever seen
a herd of vice presidents stampede?

989
01:17:44,195 --> 01:17:46,783
Mr Shayne recommended me for this job?

990
01:17:46,867 --> 01:17:51,501
Recommended? Honey, you are in
for a labour-management relationship

991
01:17:51,585 --> 01:17:53,797
Walter Reuther never dreamed of.

992
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:57,764
If you sneeze, they tear out
the air conditioning system.

993
01:17:57,847 --> 01:18:00,520
Well, that's life.

994
01:18:00,603 --> 01:18:02,858
I'm glad one of us girls made it.

995
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:14,799
You don't have to
feel sorry for me, Mr Shayne.

996
01:18:14,882 --> 01:18:17,721
I'll get my own job. I don't need your help.

997
01:18:18,848 --> 01:18:22,773
If I never work again,
at least I've done it on my own.

998
01:18:22,857 --> 01:18:26,197
I'm not like these machines
where you push a button

999
01:18:26,279 --> 01:18:28,451
and it does what you want it to do.

1000
01:18:28,536 --> 01:18:31,667
Push all you want,
you're not gonna push my buttons.

1001
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,088
I'm not a robot, I'm people.

1002
01:18:35,215 --> 01:18:36,802
And I quit!

1003
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,817
- Telephone, Mr Shayne.
- Thank you, Mario.

1004
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:08,617
Hello?

1005
01:19:10,161 --> 01:19:12,291
She did what to the machines?

1006
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:15,254
I'll be right there.

1007
01:19:16,256 --> 01:19:19,890
This is how I found it
when the night watchman called me.

1008
01:19:19,972 --> 01:19:24,482
It's awful. Buffalo gone.
Hartford, Connecticut almost wiped out.

1009
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:26,611
31,000 accounts.

1010
01:19:27,905 --> 01:19:31,621
This man had breakfast
at a Howard Johnson drive-in,

1011
01:19:31,704 --> 01:19:34,001
he's being billed for $128,000.

1012
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:37,383
Hm, it's that second cup of coffee
that gets you.

1013
01:19:37,467 --> 01:19:40,013
It'll take weeks to straighten out.

1014
01:19:40,097 --> 01:19:42,310
Do the best you can.

1015
01:19:42,393 --> 01:19:46,234
It's sabotage! She's an undercover agent
for the Diners Club.

1016
01:19:46,318 --> 01:19:49,575
No. No, I'm the one who placed
this atom bomb here.

1017
01:19:49,658 --> 01:19:52,582
I should have dropped her over the desert.

1018
01:19:54,543 --> 01:19:56,673
I've no one to blame but myself.

1019
01:19:56,756 --> 01:20:02,852
I felt sorry for this helpless kitten. Helpless?
She ought to be declared a disaster area.

1020
01:20:02,935 --> 01:20:08,029
- She's not the run-of-the-mill girl, is she?
- No. Even Darwin never figured on her.

1021
01:20:08,112 --> 01:20:11,285
The Four Horsemen
now have a riding companion.

1022
01:20:11,368 --> 01:20:16,045
There's War, Famine, Death,
Pestilence and Miss Timberlake.

1023
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:19,929
Sir, this special delivery letter
just came for you.

1024
01:20:20,012 --> 01:20:21,849
Thank you.

1025
01:20:21,933 --> 01:20:24,562
- It's from her.
- Open it.

1026
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:29,448
- I should put it in a tub of water.
- Go on, open it.

1027
01:20:30,574 --> 01:20:33,121
Calm down, I'm opening it.

1028
01:20:35,292 --> 01:20:37,421
"Dear sir,

1029
01:20:37,505 --> 01:20:43,141
"Enclosed is an itemised statement of
all expenses incurred by you on my behalf.

1030
01:20:43,226 --> 01:20:47,986
"This includes plane fare, hotel,
meals, tips and doctor's bills,

1031
01:20:48,069 --> 01:20:51,242
"which comes to a total of $729.40.

1032
01:20:51,325 --> 01:20:56,043
"It is only an estimate.
If your figure differs, please let me know.

1033
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:59,508
"Enclosed is money order
covering first payment."

1034
01:20:59,593 --> 01:21:02,473
- Three dollars?
- That's integrity.

1035
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:06,565
"You will receive a money order
for a similar amount each week

1036
01:21:06,648 --> 01:21:09,613
"until the entire obligation is discharged.

1037
01:21:09,696 --> 01:21:14,456
"With best wishes for
your continued success, Cathy Timberlake."

1038
01:21:14,539 --> 01:21:17,295
What a future, three dollars a week for life.

1039
01:21:17,378 --> 01:21:21,428
- I think it's touching. She has character.
- She's a menace.

1040
01:21:21,511 --> 01:21:25,227
Roger, I'm a man who leads
an orderly life, you know that.

1041
01:21:25,311 --> 01:21:27,941
I close doors and tighten bottle tops.

1042
01:21:28,025 --> 01:21:31,949
Miss Timberlake is a bottle
wandering around with a loose top.

1043
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:35,791
She can't hold a job,
she destroys everything she touches.

1044
01:21:35,874 --> 01:21:39,715
She should get married. Only a husband
is equipped for such a beating.

1045
01:21:39,799 --> 01:21:43,723
That's it. Roger, you have plenty of friends,
find her a husband.

1046
01:21:43,807 --> 01:21:46,103
A simple, dull, unimaginative man

1047
01:21:46,187 --> 01:21:51,114
who will smile tolerantly when he learns
she's misplaced the children.

1048
01:21:51,197 --> 01:21:53,869
Return it, mark it address unknown.

1049
01:22:08,983 --> 01:22:11,739
Dr Gruber? Roger.
I hope I'm not interrupting.

1050
01:22:11,822 --> 01:22:17,500
Not at all. I received your message.
Things worked out well in Bermuda?

1051
01:22:17,584 --> 01:22:21,342
There's been a fantastic development!
He's mentioned marriage.

1052
01:22:21,426 --> 01:22:24,181
And how do you feel about this?

1053
01:22:24,265 --> 01:22:28,899
Naturally, I'm delighted. He just left me
and I tell you this is the real thing.

1054
01:22:28,983 --> 01:22:31,028
I see.

1055
01:22:32,239 --> 01:22:35,287
Roger, I'll be away for a while.

1056
01:22:36,706 --> 01:22:40,924
I think I'd better go back to Vienna
for a refresher course.

1057
01:22:43,470 --> 01:22:46,267
He doesn't love me,
he just feels sorry for me.

1058
01:22:46,351 --> 01:22:49,232
Doesn't love you?
He compared you to the plague.

1059
01:22:49,315 --> 01:22:53,199
- What else could it be?
- He wants me to marry another man.

1060
01:22:53,281 --> 01:22:58,125
I drew up a list of 20 eligible bachelors
and turned he them all down. Why?

1061
01:22:59,878 --> 01:23:04,346
This one had a low hairline
and this one graduated from Purdue.

1062
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:06,934
- He even turned him down.
- Rock Hudson?

1063
01:23:07,017 --> 01:23:09,983
He said you'd have to live in California.

1064
01:23:10,066 --> 01:23:14,993
When he talks about a simple, dull,
unimaginative husband, he means himself.

1065
01:23:15,076 --> 01:23:17,247
He didn't say he was in love.

1066
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:21,214
It's like having a baby,
the man is always the last one to know.

1067
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:25,431
And how do we awaken him?
Not with a kiss but with a sledgehammer.

1068
01:23:25,513 --> 01:23:29,189
- But I'm going away with Beasley.
- It has to be a Beasley.

1069
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:32,068
- If he's as repulsive as you say.
- Worse.

1070
01:23:32,152 --> 01:23:36,411
- How about running away with you?
- No, he'd admire your choice.

1071
01:23:36,495 --> 01:23:38,582
It has to be someone inferior.

1072
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:43,509
To shatter Philip's ego you have go off
with the lowest human you can find.

1073
01:23:43,593 --> 01:23:48,060
That's Beasley. He's so low
when they bury him they'll have to dig up.

1074
01:23:48,143 --> 01:23:51,859
- Mr Beasley, please.
- We're doing this for Philip,

1075
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:54,239
it's for his own good, and yours too.

1076
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:57,078
He's a very nice man
and I'm the last one to admit it.

1077
01:23:57,162 --> 01:24:01,546
Even if it worked, it wouldn't be honest.
I'd be tricking him.

1078
01:24:01,629 --> 01:24:04,593
- It's a terrible way to get a man.
- Let's re-examine...

1079
01:24:04,678 --> 01:24:06,347
Stop pressing her.

1080
01:24:06,430 --> 01:24:11,566
You have now arrived at the crossroads
that every woman eventually arrives at,

1081
01:24:11,650 --> 01:24:15,783
you can either be an honest old maid
or a happy liar.

1082
01:24:19,624 --> 01:24:22,004
- 'Hello? '
- Hello.

1083
01:24:24,301 --> 01:24:26,345
This is Catherine Timberlake.

1084
01:24:28,267 --> 01:24:30,103
Well, hello there.

1085
01:24:33,486 --> 01:24:35,406
Come on.

1086
01:24:35,491 --> 01:24:38,162
I've been thinking about you.

1087
01:24:38,245 --> 01:24:44,342
'I wonder if I could, er,
reconsider your invitation, Everett.'

1088
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:46,638
I'm not one to hold grudges.

1089
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:49,978
Tonight?

1090
01:24:50,061 --> 01:24:53,193
We could have a TV dinner
at my apartment.

1091
01:24:53,275 --> 01:24:54,862
Asbury Park.

1092
01:24:54,946 --> 01:25:00,457
Er, I've heard of this charming place
in, er Asbury Park.

1093
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,713
It's, er...

1094
01:25:03,797 --> 01:25:05,425
Al's Motel.

1095
01:25:07,262 --> 01:25:11,019
That's a long drive.
What time do you have to be home?

1096
01:25:11,104 --> 01:25:13,441
Oh...

1097
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:15,404
it all depends.

1098
01:25:16,448 --> 01:25:17,868
On what?

1099
01:25:17,951 --> 01:25:21,250
Oh... Everett.

1100
01:25:25,090 --> 01:25:29,223
- I'll borrow my brother-in-law's car.
- Pick me up at five.

1101
01:25:30,310 --> 01:25:32,606
And I'll be waiting... Everett.

1102
01:25:34,943 --> 01:25:38,869
Ooh! He's like a snake.
When he smiles, he rattles.

1103
01:25:38,952 --> 01:25:42,208
He'll pick you up at five
and at one minute past five

1104
01:25:42,292 --> 01:25:45,089
I'll drop the bombshell on Mr Shayne's lap.

1105
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:50,476
- What if he doesn't follow us?
- We're dealing with a monumental ego.

1106
01:25:50,559 --> 01:25:53,147
You'll never get halfway to Asbury Park.

1107
01:25:55,945 --> 01:26:00,119
My brother-in-law's car is
being repaired but he let me have this.

1108
01:26:05,924 --> 01:26:10,057
On the way back we have to make
a delivery for him in Hoboken.

1109
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:41,370
- You've got to follow her.
- Why?

1110
01:26:41,455 --> 01:26:46,423
She's going away with another man.
She's lost her confidence with you.

1111
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:49,262
OK, send her a box of confidence.

1112
01:26:49,346 --> 01:26:52,059
Don't you realise what will happen?

1113
01:26:52,143 --> 01:26:56,234
Nothing will happen, I speak as a veteran
of two Bermuda campaigns.

1114
01:26:56,318 --> 01:26:58,364
But she's in love with you.

1115
01:26:58,447 --> 01:27:02,080
- She has a fine way of showing it.
- She's afraid of you.

1116
01:27:02,163 --> 01:27:05,461
- What does that mean?
- She's not afraid of him.

1117
01:27:05,544 --> 01:27:09,095
She doesn't care what he thinks.
That's how it happens.

1118
01:27:11,014 --> 01:27:13,060
Get my clothes.

1119
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:17,235
Get me a hairbrush, a comb,
get me everything.

1120
01:27:21,996 --> 01:27:25,042
- Where's my driver?
- He went out to eat, sir.

1121
01:27:25,126 --> 01:27:27,338
- Who sent him to eat?
- You did.

1122
01:27:27,423 --> 01:27:29,260
Cab!

1123
01:27:33,811 --> 01:27:36,733
Asbury Park. Al's Motel.

1124
01:27:36,817 --> 01:27:38,863
This girl I've gotta see.

1125
01:27:41,994 --> 01:27:44,041
Go on, hurry.

1126
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:49,176
- Who is this man?
- He's a clerk at the unemployment office.

1127
01:27:49,259 --> 01:27:51,137
How naive can she be?

1128
01:27:51,220 --> 01:27:55,104
What does she think
he's taking her there for? An aptitude test?

1129
01:27:55,188 --> 01:27:59,279
Haven't you ever seen a man dress before?
Give me my shirt.

1130
01:27:59,363 --> 01:28:04,540
Al's Motel! Sounds like a place
where you bring your own light bulbs.

1131
01:28:04,624 --> 01:28:09,007
- Why would she do that?
- He's a man and she's a woman.

1132
01:28:09,091 --> 01:28:13,517
That's the most dangerous combination
to turn loose in a motel.

1133
01:28:17,274 --> 01:28:19,236
Please, keep your eye on the road.

1134
01:28:26,877 --> 01:28:30,969
When I called for the reservation
I talked to the proprietor.

1135
01:28:31,052 --> 01:28:35,645
He said we could use the burner
in his kitchen to heat up the TV dinners.

1136
01:28:35,729 --> 01:28:37,774
We're having haddock.

1137
01:28:38,860 --> 01:28:41,281
Would you like a drink?

1138
01:28:41,365 --> 01:28:44,163
Oh, yes. That'd be fine. Let's stop for one.

1139
01:28:44,246 --> 01:28:47,586
No need to. I thought of everything.

1140
01:28:47,669 --> 01:28:50,258
Muscatel. For my lady's pleasure.

1141
01:28:52,722 --> 01:28:56,645
There's some paper cups
in the glove compartment.

1142
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:02,992
Would you mind stopping at
the service station for a minute?

1143
01:29:03,075 --> 01:29:05,163
Oh, of course.

1144
01:29:23,116 --> 01:29:27,500
- Can't you go any faster?
- This cab's got 300,000 miles on her.

1145
01:29:27,584 --> 01:29:31,258
Would you ask your grandmother
to run the high hurdles?

1146
01:29:31,341 --> 01:29:34,682
Why am I chasing her?
I should be grateful to the man.

1147
01:29:34,765 --> 01:29:36,561
Freud had a theory about that.

1148
01:29:36,644 --> 01:29:41,027
If he'd ever met this girl,
he'd have opened a delicatessen.

1149
01:29:41,112 --> 01:29:42,447
Yes.

1150
01:29:42,531 --> 01:29:44,785
Freud's Famous Frankfurters.

1151
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:56,726
Would you mind pulling into that station?

1152
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,772
Sure.

1153
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:23,698
- That convertible ahead, catch up to it.
- I'm doing 70 now.

1154
01:30:23,782 --> 01:30:25,827
I'll burn out a bearing.

1155
01:30:25,911 --> 01:30:28,290
Maybe they'll stop off for dinner.

1156
01:30:28,375 --> 01:30:33,510
When a girl's taken to a place called
Al's Motel, she better not count on dinner.

1157
01:31:02,527 --> 01:31:04,573
Amazing.

1158
01:31:10,376 --> 01:31:13,633
I told you she wouldn't make it. She's gone.

1159
01:31:13,717 --> 01:31:18,184
We'll see that she gets a decent burial.
Roger, give him a cheque.

1160
01:31:18,267 --> 01:31:21,566
First phone for another cab.
He'll be right back.

1161
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:32,255
- Do you know Asbury Park?
- Yeah.

1162
01:31:32,338 --> 01:31:35,260
- A place called Al's Motel?
- Yeah.

1163
01:31:35,343 --> 01:31:37,682
50 bucks if you get me there.

1164
01:31:37,765 --> 01:31:39,978
Well, it's a little out of my way.

1165
01:31:41,064 --> 01:31:42,651
Here.

1166
01:31:42,733 --> 01:31:45,406
- Hop in the back.
- Right. In the...? Oh.

1167
01:32:11,250 --> 01:32:13,086
Oh!

1168
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:28,577
But there's the motel,
we'll be in in a few minutes.

1169
01:32:28,661 --> 01:32:31,249
You register and I'll meet you inside.

1170
01:32:31,332 --> 01:32:35,341
OK. But when you get back to New York,
you ought to have a checkup.

1171
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:50,246
- This is it.
- Thank you.

1172
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:52,750
A man spends an entire lifetime

1173
01:32:52,835 --> 01:32:58,638
trying to lead a civilised, dignified,
orderly existence and then he meets a girl,

1174
01:32:58,722 --> 01:33:02,186
five days later he's running round
New York in a bath towel,

1175
01:33:02,271 --> 01:33:05,318
riding in a truck filled with dead chickens,

1176
01:33:05,402 --> 01:33:08,616
tracking her down to
this beaverboard Taj Mahal.

1177
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:11,832
And poets call it love.
No wonder they starve.

1178
01:33:11,914 --> 01:33:14,546
Oh, the nuts you pick up on the road.

1179
01:33:15,714 --> 01:33:17,551
- Hi.
- How do you do?

1180
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:21,560
Did a couple just register here?
A blonde about so high?

1181
01:33:21,643 --> 01:33:24,565
Yeah! About ten minutes ago.
Mr and Mrs Smith.

1182
01:33:24,649 --> 01:33:28,031
- That's them.
- Are you a friend of the happy couple?

1183
01:33:28,115 --> 01:33:30,078
I gave the bride away.

1184
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:35,129
- They're in the bridal suite. I'll ring them.
- No. Let me surprise them.

1185
01:33:42,853 --> 01:33:44,816
Oh. All right, where is she?

1186
01:33:44,899 --> 01:33:46,778
- Who?
- Mrs Smith.

1187
01:33:46,861 --> 01:33:49,659
- She's in there, changing.
- Into what?

1188
01:33:51,955 --> 01:33:53,876
Now just a moment.

1189
01:33:53,959 --> 01:33:55,879
What she ever saw in you...

1190
01:33:55,963 --> 01:33:58,552
- Come out of there!
- What right have you got?

1191
01:33:58,635 --> 01:34:02,435
Every right. I least I took her to a hotel,
not a rabbit hutch.

1192
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:06,192
- She went to a hotel with you?
- She collects hotel keys.

1193
01:34:06,276 --> 01:34:08,321
Are you coming out?

1194
01:34:12,539 --> 01:34:17,215
Congratulations, my friend.
You've got a great little girl there.

1195
01:34:20,013 --> 01:34:22,141
Who was that man?

1196
01:34:22,225 --> 01:34:24,938
You librarians live it up pretty good.

1197
01:34:25,899 --> 01:34:29,490
He didn't follow me and Beasley's
checking in. What shall I do?

1198
01:34:29,573 --> 01:34:31,911
Don't fall apart, keep your head.

1199
01:34:31,995 --> 01:34:34,208
Remember your girl scout training.

1200
01:34:34,291 --> 01:34:36,838
We never covered a situation like this.

1201
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:39,426
Stall for time. Go to the ladies' room.

1202
01:34:39,511 --> 01:34:43,977
I already hit every gas station
between Newark and Asbury Park.

1203
01:34:44,061 --> 01:34:46,608
Oh, what made me think it would work?

1204
01:34:46,690 --> 01:34:49,614
Why should he follow me?
He doesn't love me.

1205
01:34:49,697 --> 01:34:54,874
Oh, Connie, if only he'd show up.
I'd fall on the ground and kiss his feet...

1206
01:34:58,005 --> 01:35:00,094
Oh, Mr Shayne.

1207
01:35:00,177 --> 01:35:02,306
What a pleasant surprise.

1208
01:35:02,390 --> 01:35:05,437
Erm, are you stopping at
the same motel we are?

1209
01:35:05,521 --> 01:35:08,945
Don't press your luck. Kiss his feet!

1210
01:35:09,028 --> 01:35:10,948
Did you drive up with anyone?

1211
01:35:11,032 --> 01:35:12,786
Yes, a plucked chicken.

1212
01:35:12,870 --> 01:35:17,296
Oh. Maybe the four of us
can get together later for a drink.

1213
01:35:17,379 --> 01:35:21,387
Oh, honey. You're blowing the whole thing.

1214
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:24,100
- Hang up the phone.
- I will not.

1215
01:35:24,185 --> 01:35:26,230
Hang up that phone.

1216
01:35:26,314 --> 01:35:30,823
This is no time to argue.
Get married first, then fight.

1217
01:35:30,907 --> 01:35:32,744
Hello?

1218
01:35:33,870 --> 01:35:36,000
My lover's waiting for me.

1219
01:35:36,083 --> 01:35:39,048
After we're married, I'll invite him over.

1220
01:35:39,131 --> 01:35:43,557
- We can't get married, I have problems.
- We'll work on them.

1221
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:47,022
I'm unstable.
What kind of mother would I make?

1222
01:35:47,105 --> 01:35:49,778
If you fail, we can breed poodles.

1223
01:35:49,861 --> 01:35:54,913
I also lie. And I can't stand Beasley.
It was a trap to get you to follow me.

1224
01:35:54,996 --> 01:35:57,252
And don't forget the rashes.

1225
01:35:57,335 --> 01:35:59,422
Put your hands in.

1226
01:35:59,506 --> 01:36:01,593
Hey!

1227
01:36:08,858 --> 01:36:12,366
Hey, come back!
I've already paid for the room!

1228
01:36:23,889 --> 01:36:27,856
Did a couple just check in?
Blonde woman about this high?

1229
01:36:27,939 --> 01:36:29,985
Yeah. Number 9.

1230
01:36:30,987 --> 01:36:33,074
But what was I to think when...

1231
01:36:33,158 --> 01:36:37,374
You believe I never cared for
another man till you walked into the library?

1232
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,172
- Of course!
- I won't be long.

1233
01:36:51,862 --> 01:36:53,909
All right, where is she?

1234
01:36:55,328 --> 01:37:00,380
You're even more repulsive than she said.
No wonder she begged me to come.

1235
01:37:02,385 --> 01:37:04,888
It's me, Roger.

1236
01:37:04,973 --> 01:37:06,977
Hello?

1237
01:37:07,060 --> 01:37:09,857
Mother! You were right about women.

1238
01:37:11,569 --> 01:37:13,991
Yes, Momma. I'll wait outside.

1239
01:37:14,075 --> 01:37:16,120
Come and get me.

1240
01:37:20,754 --> 01:37:25,264
Nothing serious, just another rash.
Quite common on honeymoons.

1241
01:37:25,347 --> 01:37:28,687
I would recommend
an uninterrupted night's sleep.

1242
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:30,608
Naturally.

1243
01:37:30,691 --> 01:37:32,278
Cathy!

1244
01:37:32,362 --> 01:37:35,075
- Yes, darling?
- I'm so sorry.

1245
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,204
You couldn't help it.

1246
01:37:37,288 --> 01:37:39,918
But it never happened before.

1247
01:37:40,002 --> 01:37:43,258
You've never been in
this situation before - married.

1248
01:37:43,343 --> 01:37:45,388
Hmm, that could be it.

1249
01:37:46,307 --> 01:37:49,939
- I just had a horrible thought.
- What?

1250
01:37:50,023 --> 01:37:54,573
You break out when we're not married, I do
when we are, we may never get together.

1251
01:37:54,658 --> 01:37:59,376
If that's what you think, you don't know
the girls in Upper Sandusky.

1252
01:38:11,650 --> 01:38:16,451
Roger, take care of the baby, will you?
I want to take a picture of Cathy.

1253
01:38:16,535 --> 01:38:18,581
Come along, dear.

1254
01:38:25,386 --> 01:38:27,223
Dr Gruber!

1255
01:38:27,306 --> 01:38:29,811
Roger.

1256
01:38:29,895 --> 01:38:32,233
- How was Vienna?
- I just got back.

1257
01:38:32,316 --> 01:38:34,279
I've been meaning to call you.

1258
01:38:34,363 --> 01:38:36,701
What happened with that friend of yours?

1259
01:38:36,784 --> 01:38:38,663
The wedding was last July.

1260
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,880
- How did it work out?
- Take a look.
