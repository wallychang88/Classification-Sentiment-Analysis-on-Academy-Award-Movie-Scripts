1
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,696
Since ancient times,

2
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,990
there have been
three great changes

3
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,117
in man's idea of himself.

4
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,580
Three major blows
dealt us in our vanity.

5
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:05,959
Before Copernicus, we thought we
were the center of the universe,

6
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,422
that all the heavenly bodies
revolved around our Earth.

7
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,468
But the great astronomer
shattered that conceit,

8
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,596
and we were forced
to admit our planet

9
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,891
is but one of many
which swing around the Sun.

10
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,686
That there are other systems
beyond our solar system

11
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,105
in myriad worlds.

12
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,566
Before Charles Darwin,

13
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,486
man believed he was
a species unto himself,

14
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,364
separate and apart
from the animal kingdom.

15
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,535
But the great biologist made us
see that our physical organism

16
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,830
is the product
of a vast evolutionary process

17
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,083
whose laws
are no different for us

18
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,377
than for any other form
of animal life.

19
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,797
Before Sigmund Freud,
man believed that what he said

20
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:55,592
and did were the products
of his conscious will alone.

21
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,261
But the great psychologist,

22
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,764
demonstrated the existence
of another part of our mind.

23
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,642
Which functions
in darkest secrecy

24
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:06,770
and can even rule our lives.

25
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:10,732
This is the story of Freud's
descent into a region

26
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,985
almost as black as hell itself.

27
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,115
Man's unconscious,
and how he let in the light.

28
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,849
A new patient, Herr Professor.

29
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,561
Hysteria.
Who admitted this patient?

30
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,813
| did, Herr Professor.

31
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:34,191
Are you ignorant of my rule

32
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:36,318
barring so-called hysterics
from my department?

33
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:39,946
| am blind, Herr Professor!
| can't move my leg!

34
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:45,786
| know the rules, Professor
Meynert, but this woman is sick.

35
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,039
With your permission
| would like to make some tests.

36
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:51,041
Tests? By all means
let us conduct tests

37
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,292
here and now, Herr Freud.

38
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,920
| shall use this occasion
to enlighten you

39
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,421
as the true nature of hysteria.

40
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,256
Be quiet.

41
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,258
This woman claims
to be suffering

42
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,551
from paralysis of the left leg.

43
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,054
In a genuine spastic paralysis,

44
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,806
the leg wouldn't be
so inflexibly rigid.

45
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,892
Gentlemen, our paralytic
is putting on an exhibition

46
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,519
more suited to the Volks theater

47
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,062
than to a bed in my ward!

48
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:15,649
Her symptoms have been
assumed with the purpose

49
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:18,109
of attracting attention,
gaining pity,

50
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:20,570
and escaping
the responsibilities of life.

51
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:24,074
As for her claim to blindness...

52
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,742
A match.

53
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,410
Light it.

54
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,213
- What do you see?
- Her pupils are contracting.

55
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:44,135
Do you believe this is
a genuine case of blindness?

56
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,428
No.

57
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,429
Ah, uh...

58
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:49,891
Herr Professor, will you
permit me to make a test?

59
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,562
By all means.

60
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:13,915
No reaction.

61
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,585
Is this pretending?

62
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,463
Anesthesia induced by
deliberately maintaining the leg

63
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,965
in a cramped
and unnatural position.

64
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:24,634
Hysteria is another
name for lying.

65
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,052
Pity there's no therapy
for that.

66
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:28,805
You'll see to it personally,
Herr Freud,

67
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:30,724
that this bed
is vacated at once.

68
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,609
Mother, what should I do?

69
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,945
Leave the hospital.
Go somewhere else.

70
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,741
That would mean
starting all over again.

71
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,121
| know how you and father have
slaved to put me where I am.

72
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,957
How my sisters went without.

73
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,877
We wanted the honor of having
a doctor in the family.

74
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,005
And Martha?
| can't ask her to wait forever.

75
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,842
Before you and Martha
were engaged,

76
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,762
you thought of applying
for a Traveling Grant.

77
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,263
Could you still get one?

78
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:13,683
Yes, yes.

79
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,144
That might be the answer.

80
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,356
Maybe.

81
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,028
How long would you be away?

82
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,323
Six months, a year.
| don't know.

83
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,534
Where would you go?

84
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:36,414
Oh... Berlin,
perhaps to Charcot.

85
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,001
Is Charcot a city or a man?

86
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,587
A man, a genius.

87
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,716
He's in Paris conducting
experiments in hysteria.

88
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,261
There are certain
mental phenomena

89
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:53,556
which defy all
the rules of science.

90
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,935
Most of us refuse to admit
they exist, not Charcot.

91
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,938
He's had the courage
to break with the axiom

92
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,190
that thought and consciousness
are one and the same.

93
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:07,362
He has proven that the mind
can think in a state of sleep,

94
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,447
artificial sleep
induced by hypnosis.

95
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,077
Yes, he dares to use hypnosis,
a heresy in science.

96
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,247
Of course you're
going to Charcot.

97
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,290
| am? How do you know?

98
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,710
By your voice,
when you talk about him.

99
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,337
Oh.

100
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:29,551
| think it was decided before
your disagreement with Meynert.

101
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,474
Frau So far away, Paris.
A day, a night and a day.

102
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:38,059
And trains run after dark now.

103
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,894
- Have a nice trip.
- Goodbye.

104
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:43,481
- Good luck.
- Goodbye. Thank you.

105
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,983
Frau and Sigi cried the whole...

106
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,651
You won't forget me, Sigi?

107
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,364
- All Aboard!
- Goodbye.

108
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,826
- Mama...
- All Aboard!

109
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,286
To keep you warm this winter.

110
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:58,163
- Thank you.
- Papa.

111
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:02,417
Sigmund, this watch belonged
to my father, Alev Ashalom.

112
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:05,628
Now, it's time for you to depart
from your loved ones,

113
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,589
- I present it to you...
- Thank you.

114
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,216
- As a symbol. Bye.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

115
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,156
Oh, what an unhappy accident!

116
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,661
Thank you.

117
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,167
The word "hysteria"

118
00:09:44,167 --> 00:09:48,797
is from the Greek word
"hysteron", meaning "womb".

119
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,593
To this day,
doctors believe the disease

120
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,262
only exists in women if

121
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:59,390
that is, they admit
its existence at all.

122
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:03,478
There are many who would
deny it a place

123
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,814
in the pages of the
Encyclopedia Medica.

124
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:10,193
Excellent description of
hysteria may be found

125
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:13,530
in the records of witchcraft
trials in former times.

126
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:18,451
Its victims were supposed
to be possessed by the Devil.

127
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,248
There were veritable epidemics
of this delusion.

128
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:25,166
Whole communities were infected.

129
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:30,004
Yes, it was infectious,
yet it had no germ.

130
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,383
Hysteria violates
the medical tenet

131
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:36,928
that all bodily symptoms
must be of organic origin,

132
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,764
and the psychological tenet

133
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,351
that the mind is capable
of only one thought at a time.

134
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,939
But the facts do not cease
to exist because they are

135
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:50,233
in contradiction to
our beloved theories.

136
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,236
| intend to prove here,
by demonstration,

137
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,697
that hysteria
is a purely mental malady

138
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:58,616
and that the mind
can be divided against itself

139
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:01,786
so that it pursues two lines
of thought simultaneously.

140
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,467
- What do you see?
- Paralysis.

141
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,136
Flaccid paralysis.

142
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:25,852
My dear Jeanne, how long
have you been unable to walk?

143
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,898
- Since 1880.
- Six years ago.

144
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,608
Did anything happen
to you at that time

145
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,860
which might have brought on
your illness?

146
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,653
No.

147
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,032
Here is one of the most
characteristic facts

148
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,283
of hysteria.

149
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,202
The patient remembers nothing.

150
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,787
Yet we've learned
from her relatives

151
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,456
that the appearance
of her symptoms

152
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,791
followed immediately
upon a railway crash.

153
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,586
She wasn't injured physically.

154
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:55,673
Her condition is due solely
to psychological trauma.

155
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:05,308
And here, we have,
to all appearances,

156
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,562
a classical example
of paralysis agitans.

157
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,110
Servais, when was it
that you first began to tremble?

158
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,071
A... About a month ago.

159
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,240
Servais was a
woodcutter by profession.

160
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:23,576
A cabin, in which he had taken
refuge from a thunderstorm,

161
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,911
was struck by lightning.

162
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,456
The incident,
of which Servais has no memory,

163
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:31,084
took place, not a month,
but over a year ago.

164
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,962
Following the accident,

165
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:36,839
he went into a state which is
typical for victims of trauma:

166
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:40,593
His color became leaden,
his eyes vacant,

167
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,637
his movements were mechanical.

168
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:46,182
He behaved as though he were
in a state of hypnotic trance!

169
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,143
By means of hypnosis,

170
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,522
a practice that science has
but recently freed from

171
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:53,648
the service of black magic,

172
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:58,027
we are able to produce
a mental state in the patient

173
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,531
similar to that in which
his symptoms were conceived.

174
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,120
I'm going to put you to sleep.

175
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,707
Look straight into the flame
with both your eyes.

176
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:12,417
Straight into the flame.

177
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,627
Now you're going to sleep.

178
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,255
A very deep sleep.

179
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,883
You're going
deeper and deeper into sleep.

180
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,219
A deep and peaceful sleep.

181
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:27,390
You're sleeping. Deeply, deeply.

182
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,729
You're now on rapport
with Professor Charcot.

183
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,440
He'll give you orders
and you'll obey them.

184
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,943
| now propose to demonstrate
to you gentlemen

185
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:44,240
that these two patients are not
suffering from organic disease,

186
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,035
but that their symptoms

187
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,664
are the result of ideas
holding sway in their minds.

188
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,834
- Do you hear me, Servais?
- Yes.

189
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:59,881
You're quite safe.
You have no fear at all.

190
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,634
You're growing calm. Quiet.

191
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,220
Completely quiet.

192
00:14:08,139 --> 00:14:12,143
When I clap my hands,
you won't shake anymore.

193
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,024
Good, Servais. Very good.

194
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:23,488
We've eliminated the hysterical
symptom by a spoken command,

195
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,367
thereby demonstrating
that his affliction

196
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,410
is not of organic origin.

197
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,248
Jeanne.

198
00:14:37,627 --> 00:14:38,836
Sleep, Jeanne.

199
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:40,630
Sleep.

200
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,591
Deeper and deeper into sleep.

201
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,678
A gentle and restful sleep.

202
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:53,976
A sweet, peaceful sleep.
Deeper, deeper.

203
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,312
Sleep.

204
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:03,444
Jeanne, now I give
you over to Professor Charcot.

205
00:15:04,654 --> 00:15:06,030
Do you hear me, Jeanne?

206
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,826
Yes.

207
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:15,373
Your legs.
Sensation is returning to them.

208
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:21,629
Yes.

209
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,801
You can feel the blood
flowing through them.

210
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,973
You are cured, cured!

211
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,726
You can move your legs.

212
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,567
Go ahead and move them.

213
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,654
Good, Jeanne. Very good.

214
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,491
You can even stand upon them.

215
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,535
Yes, you can stand.

216
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:56,122
Rise up and
stand upon your legs.

217
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,723
Splendid, Jeanne. Splendid.

218
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,268
Open your eyes, open your eyes!

219
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,813
Walk, now. Don't be afraid.

220
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,315
Walk around the room.

221
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,860
And now, having demonstrated

222
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,321
that we can remove symptoms
by suggestion,

223
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:32,366
let's see if we're able
to create them as well.

224
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,828
When I clap my hands,

225
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:38,414
your legs will go to sleep.

226
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,750
They will no longer support you.

227
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,505
They will be paralyzed.
Immovable, without feeling.

228
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:56,974
Stand still, Jeanne.

229
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:01,020
Do you see Servais over there?

230
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,692
Remember how he shook?

231
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,363
Do you, Jeanne?

232
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,283
Like that.

233
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,119
Wasn't it, Jeanne?

234
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:24,168
And now, your arm is shaking
like his did.

235
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,593
Now both your arms.

236
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,597
Shaking, shaking.

237
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,643
And your legs.
You can't stop, can you?

238
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,688
You shake, shake.

239
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:49,443
Gentlemen, you've witnessed the
birth of a hysterical symptom.

240
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:55,950
Now my assistants are going to
awaken our patients.

241
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:58,452
They will remember nothing.

242
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,830
Servais will regain
the use of his legs,

243
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,707
but his tremor
will set in again.

244
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:06,919
And Jeanne will cease trembling
only to be paralyzed as before.

245
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,715
The hypnotic state
is a counterfeit, alas.

246
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,301
It enables us to understand,
but not to cure.

247
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,732
- Mazeltov!
- Mazeltov!

248
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:30,901
Magzeltov, son.

249
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:39,368
Your daughter, and mine now,
is very beautiful.

250
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:43,539
As beautiful almost as my own
Amalia was on our wedding day.

251
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:45,916
But Martha is luckier.

252
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,419
All Amalia got
was a humble cloth merchant.

253
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,796
But Martha has here a genius,

254
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,757
and soon the
whole world will know it.

255
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,426
Whether these alien ideas

256
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:57,219
spring from the subject's
own mind,

257
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,848
as in auto-suggestion following
a traumatic experience,

258
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:03,476
or by hetero-suggestion
as in hypnosis,

259
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,438
or by the Devil himself,
as our forefathers thought,

260
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,106
is relatively unimportant.

261
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:15,738
Important is that these ideas
remain unknown to the patient,

262
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,074
that is to say
they are unconscious.

263
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,994
There is much talk nowadays
about the unconscious.

264
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,706
So far, it has only been
a philosophical abstraction,

265
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,876
but Professor Charchot
has enabled us

266
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,294
to reach out and touch it.

267
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,047
We must now accept the fact that

268
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,550
there can be thinking that
is not on a conscious level.

269
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,720
Are these unconscious thoughts

270
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,139
the wild products of
a shattered mind,

271
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,977
or are they connected to
the trauma by a chain of logic

272
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,647
whose links we have
yet to discover?

273
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,454
Thank you, Dr. Freud.

274
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,834
| believe I reflect the
sentiments of my colleagues

275
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,713
when I assure you of our
appreciation of your report.

276
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:16,298
It is my personal opinion,
however,

277
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,384
that there's nothing
in what we've heard

278
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:21,137
that is new to
Viennese physicians.

279
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,013
I'll say a few words.

280
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,392
| beg to disagree
with our esteemed chairman,

281
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:31,147
for I've found in what we've
been told some new ideas,

282
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,523
and some ideas that are true.

283
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,026
But the ideas that are true,
are not new,

284
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,572
and those that are new,
are not true.

285
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,451
Some patients
show nervous disorders

286
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,077
similar to those
presented to us.

287
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,579
But that's not new.

288
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,457
None of us is unaware
that violent emotions

289
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,000
can affect the
central nervous system.

290
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,296
But why this talk of diabolic
ideas and the unconscious?

291
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,466
Are we theologians
or physicians?

292
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,719
Again, when our colleague
feels obliged

293
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:05,097
to instruct and enlighten his
seniors about hypnotism,

294
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,640
he forgets in his enthusiasm

295
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:08,517
that he's telling
us nothing new.

296
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:12,521
It's not true that hypnotism
is a scientific method.

297
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:17,568
| consider a hypnotist and his
subject a pair of sick people,

298
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,737
of whom the more seriously sick

299
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,572
is certainly not
the one hypnotized.

300
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,785
Viennese doctors are satisfied

301
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:28,537
to leave metaphysical
speculation to the Parisians,

302
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,207
and heed humbly and patiently

303
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,250
the lessons of
physiological experiment.

304
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,008
Do you wish to reply,
Dr. Freud?

305
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,052
Thank you, no.

306
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:48,808
| believe Professor Meynert
has expressed our sentiments.

307
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:52,061
With your permission,
| hereby adjourn the meeting.

308
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,665
Herr colleague, I congratulate
you on a fascinating paper.

309
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,793
You're not afraid to touch
the leper?

310
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:18,963
The man who read that paper is
too intelligent to be affected

311
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,381
by the reception it got.

312
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,510
If I won the approval of
the eminent Dr. Breuer,

313
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,553
it's reward enough.

314
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,264
I'd have joined the debate,

315
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,682
but that would have
required a confession

316
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,600
I'm not prepared to
make quite yet.

317
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,728
| too have been dabbling
in the Black Art.

318
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,022
Hypnosis?

319
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,985
A young woman who had
a nervous breakdown

320
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:42,945
after her father's death.

321
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:46,824
When I took the case, she was
suffering from some disorders,

322
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,242
including insomnia.

323
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,327
The first time I hypnotized her,

324
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,830
my thought was to get her
to sleep without drugs.

325
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,084
But on entering trance
she began to talk in random,

326
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,794
disconnected phrases.

327
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,423
But presently I sensed a meaning
behind her words

328
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,757
and began asking questions.

329
00:23:04,258 --> 00:23:07,469
Before long, I discovered
the reason for her insomnia.

330
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,723
She was terrified of
a recurrent dream

331
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:13,851
in which she saw
her father's body

332
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:15,895
being devoured
by the cats of Naples

333
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:17,229
where his death had occurred.

334
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,650
Telling me about it seemed
to relieve her of its horror.

335
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:25,696
She quieted and passed from
trance into restful sleep.

336
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,241
It occurred to me that if one
symptom could be relieved

337
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,744
by such procedure,
another might.

338
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:35,664
I've been hypnotizing her
regularly these last few months.

339
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,709
| trace back from the symptom
to its source,

340
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,377
make her remember

341
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,796
and the act of remembering
the incident,

342
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,049
causes the symptom to disappear.

343
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,760
- Surely it comes back.
- No.

344
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,555
- Not one has come back.
- She's still very ill.

345
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,099
Her vision's disturbed,
she's semi-paralyzed.

346
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,518
At the moment I'm working
on her inability

347
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,187
to drink water from a glass.

348
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:00,522
Water is dirty.

349
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,443
It looks so pure, so clear.

350
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,820
But it is full of vileness.

351
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,241
What makes you think
water is dirty?

352
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,869
My father told me so in Naples.

353
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:18,374
In Naples, perhaps,
but now you're back in Vienna.

354
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,585
You drank water here
until a few days ago.

355
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,171
Why did you stop drinking water?

356
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,300
The animal!

357
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,301
What animal?

358
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,886
Filthy!

359
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:35,099
Long black tongue, black nose!

360
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,977
Horrible!

361
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,022
Cecily, remember.

362
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,817
What kind of animal was it?

363
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,153
It was a dog. My dog.

364
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,239
Your dachshund, Schnapp?

365
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,365
Yes.

366
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:55,244
What did Schnapp do? Tell me.

367
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,205
You can see it happening now.

368
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:02,001
Schnapp is on my bed.
At my tray.

369
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:06,296
He is drinking from my golden
cup. Schnapp is defiling it.

370
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:09,216
The one that father gave me.

371
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:15,264
That nurse, mean, vicious
creature, she let him do it.

372
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:17,599
| hate all nurses!

373
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:27,985
I'm thirsty.

374
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,447
So thirsty.

375
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,954
Sit up, Cecily. Sit up.

376
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,749
You can drink now.

377
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:46,170
Drink, Cecily.
You will wake up drinking.

378
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:50,007
As you awaken,
you will be drinking

379
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,717
and you will remember
everything.

380
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,095
Wake up, Cecily.

381
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,485
Drink, my dear, drink.

382
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,199
Do you remember your dog
drinking from your cup?

383
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,869
And I was so angry
with the nurse.

384
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:21,747
Is that all there is to it?

385
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,971
Yes, Mama. I can drink again.

386
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,978
How do you reconcile this
with Charcot's theory?

387
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,148
If her mind had been divided,

388
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:51,151
why would remembering
the traumatic incident

389
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:55,155
relieve a symptom? The darkened
part would produce wild ideas.

390
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,658
No. Charcot is mistaken.

391
00:26:57,658 --> 00:27:01,245
Trauma doesn't divide the mind
as an axe splits a log.

392
00:27:01,245 --> 00:27:03,872
It only causes the memory
of the incident

393
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,666
to be struck off
from consciousness.

394
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,709
But how can unconscious memories
create symptoms?

395
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,587
Because they are surrounded
by emotions

396
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,966
that cannot find their natural
outlet through consciousness.

397
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,970
If you are overcome by grief,
you shed tears.

398
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,264
Angry, you strike a blow.
Frightened, you run.

399
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,684
The emotion aroused in you is
discharged in physical action.

400
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,480
But, what happens if the emotion
is dammed up, strangulated?

401
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:32,442
There's fire in the fireplace,
but the chimney is blocked.

402
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,028
The fire doesn't go out.
It smolders,

403
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,865
and smoke fills the room,
the entire house.

404
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:41,076
And finally, it leaks out
through a pantry window.

405
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,080
A morbid symptom is only
emotional energy

406
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,248
coming out the wrong place.

407
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,669
Freud, what do you think?

408
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,464
| think a door has been opened.

409
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:58,177
You've made a discovery
as important as Pasteur's.

410
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:02,764
He isolated the germ, you've
isolated the pathogenic memory.

411
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,058
Cecily's may be a unique case.

412
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,187
I'm rather inclined to think
she's a classic case.

413
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:11,982
Would it be possible for you

414
00:28:11,982 --> 00:28:13,984
to try out this method
in the hospital?

415
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,487
Yes.

416
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,158
You row to the
middle of the lake,

417
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,161
what happens then?

418
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,918
- I stand up.
-Yes?

419
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,839
The boat rocks. I'm falling.

420
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,511
The boat turns over.
I'm in the water.

421
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:43,096
My brother calls for help.

422
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:47,476
| swim around the boat,
but I can't find him.

423
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,396
- My brother is gone.
- Where is he?

424
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,522
Drowned.

425
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:55,776
The boat sinks!

426
00:28:57,361 --> 00:28:59,696
- I swim for the shore.
- You swim?

427
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,282
| swim.

428
00:29:06,536 --> 00:29:08,038
What are you doing, Dr. Freud?

429
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,916
| order you to
stop this at once.

430
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,293
Quiet, you fool.

431
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:16,964
In Professor Meynert's absence,
| am in charge here.

432
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:20,008
- He doesn't approve hypnosis.
- Damn you both.

433
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,554
| shall tell Meynert
what you said.

434
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,015
I'll tell him myself.

435
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,953
What can I do for you,
Herr Freud?

436
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,539
Professor Meynert,

437
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,750
did you give anyone authority
to stop me practicing hypnosis?

438
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:56,670
Of course.

439
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,715
But the patient was
from the general ward.

440
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,133
He wasn't from your department.

441
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:02,634
You are, Freud.

442
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,221
You realize you're forcing me to
resign my post at the hospital.

443
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,808
You renounced science completely

444
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,935
the day you rejected my offer
and went to Paris.

445
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,479
Paris, the path
to fame and fortune.

446
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,190
Six easy lessons...
A la Charcot.

447
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:19,693
How dare you say that?

448
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:23,196
How will you prevent it?
You'll hypnotize me?

449
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,407
At my command, everyone asleep!

450
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:28,618
The blind at attention!
You are ordered to see!

451
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:32,205
Paralytics, about turn!

452
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,624
Quick march one-two, one-two!

453
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:39,004
Heil, Sigmund Freud,
the conquering here of neurosis.

454
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,923
As if you knew
what a neurosis is.

455
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,301
As if your Charcot knew.

456
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,096
It's a way of making life
possible and you rob them of it!

457
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,266
You would bring the
light of understanding

458
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,226
into their poor benighted souls.

459
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,396
And the evil spirits will fly
away when the cock crows.

460
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:58,982
Look.

461
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,619
Yes, scorpions.
The fatal kind, from Mexico.

462
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,662
I'm testing the effects
of their poison

463
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,748
on the nervous system
of higher animals.

464
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:16,833
Charming little fellows.

465
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:19,086
Here's the sun test.

466
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,048
Well, Freud,

467
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,842
do you think light kills
evil spirits?

468
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,053
| rather think it revives them.

469
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,681
If the box remains open,
they'll run about everywhere.

470
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,227
The room... the world will be
alive with them.

471
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:40,482
Back into darkness.

472
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:43,151
There you are.

473
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,862
Leave to the night
what belongs to the night.

474
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,199
- Schnapps?
- Thank you, I don't drink.

475
00:31:49,825 --> 00:31:53,412
You don't drink. You'd be too
afraid of letting yourself go.

476
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,705
What would let slip
if you got drunk?

477
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:59,835
One takes every precaution.
One walls oneself in.

478
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:04,089
| know what you are. I've been
observing you for a long time.

479
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,217
| am certain that neurosis
is lying in wait for you.

480
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:08,677
| know the symptoms.

481
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:11,555
| know why you're attracted
by other people's madness,

482
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,014
because it makes you
forget your own.

483
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,225
How would you like
your old master

484
00:32:15,225 --> 00:32:16,893
to be sick of hysteria
a la Charcot?

485
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,020
How well you'd take care of him.

486
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,692
No luck.
I'm as sound as an apple.

487
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,612
Goodbye, Freud.
Leave and don't come back.

488
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,033
- How old are you?
- 30.

489
00:32:34,161 --> 00:32:36,788
| was the same age
when I made my choice

490
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,166
between research
and practicing medicine.

491
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:44,629
In time, you too could become
a very successful practitioner.

492
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,467
Have your own carriage,
vintage wines,

493
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,135
a brightly lighted house.

494
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,305
Not that I have any complaints.

495
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,474
I'm a better physician than |
would have been a scientist.

496
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,893
Your paper on the vagus nerve
is a classic.

497
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,562
And for that,
unimportant as it is,

498
00:33:00,562 --> 00:33:03,982
rather than for my powers
as a healer I may be remembered.

499
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,029
That and my association
with you,

500
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:12,073
perhaps, if you choose
to devote yourself

501
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:14,034
to the study of hysteria.

502
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:16,995
How? I'll be lucky to eke out
a living in general practice?

503
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,206
Hear me out.

504
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:23,668
This is my opportunity to put
back into the bank of science

505
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:26,421
something more than
the sum of talent I withdraw.

506
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,550
Let me endow us.
Say 200 guilders a month,

507
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,428
and I'll send you
my hysterical patients.

508
00:33:34,638 --> 00:33:36,681
When the time comes,
we'll publish our findings.

509
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,519
Studies on Hysteria,
by Freud and Breuer.

510
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,774
Breuer and Freud.

511
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:47,400
And my wife said:

512
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,154
"I'm not jealous
in the slightest,”

513
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,034
but I would like to know
how you have the nerve

514
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:00,455
to play the ladies' man with
other women in front of me

515
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,835
who knows from bitter experience
that you're not a man at all...

516
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,424
It was like a slap in my face.

517
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,351
When you wake up,

518
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,563
you'll remember everything
you've told me.

519
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,566
Everything.

520
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,027
Wake up.

521
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,033
Father has had his heart attack.

522
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:40,412
I'm sitting at his bedside.

523
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:43,790
It's a warm summer evening.

524
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:46,876
Window is open.

525
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,422
| hear music.

526
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,258
Dance music.

527
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,638
It's coming from a house
across the street.

528
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,726
They are dancing on the terrace.

529
00:35:04,686 --> 00:35:06,062
| love to dance.

530
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,356
| long to be with them.

531
00:35:10,483 --> 00:35:13,612
How wicked of me when
my poor father may be dying.

532
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,407
I'm a bad daughter.

533
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:21,536
| close the window to keep
the music out.

534
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,331
Room becomes stifling.

535
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,917
| can't breathe.

536
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,546
| am going to wake you.

537
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:33,965
And when I do,

538
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,677
you'll be able to breathe
normally again.

539
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:40,221
Wake up.

540
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,350
You'll remember
everything you said.

541
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,810
Wake up.

542
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,782
Music coming through a window.

543
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:00,825
A wife's scornful words,

544
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,913
not cataclysms like railroad
crashes and lightning bolts.

545
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,291
Yet all memory of them, too,
was struck from consciousness.

546
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,796
Could there be
a psychic mechanism

547
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:15,924
which defends the mind
against intolerable memories

548
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:20,136
as lymph glands do the body
against infection?

549
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:22,806
A mechanism of repression

550
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:26,267
which banishes such memories
to the unconscious?

551
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:29,270
And locks the door.

552
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,906
Dr. Freud.

553
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,220
How do you do,
Herr von Schlosser?

554
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,639
How do you do?

555
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,708
Heine, Beaudelaire, Rambeau.

556
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
You like poetry?

557
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,213
Yes, very much.

558
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:40,592
Do you write verse yourself?

559
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:43,762
| try.

560
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:49,434
| cannot find the rhymes.

561
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,520
Thank you.

562
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:56,900
Your tunic?

563
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,404
No. It was my father's
when he was my age.

564
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,573
A captain in the Hussars.

565
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:09,913
You can see the rent from a
saber at the Battle of Custoza.

566
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,917
Why do you have it on display?

567
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,714
- I'm proud of my father.
- And yet you attacked him.

568
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:24,844
Yes.

569
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:27,806
And without reason.

570
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,643
| must be going mad.

571
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:36,356
Are you going to put me
in an asylum?

572
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,234
Because...

573
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:42,779
Because I shall
kill myself first.

574
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,243
Sit down, would you?

575
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,788
There's nothing to be afraid of.
I'm here to help you.

576
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,374
Sit down.

577
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:04,801
Herr Von Schlosser,

578
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,429
| want to concentrate
all your attention

579
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,014
on the end of this cigarette.

580
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,559
Relax.

581
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,144
That's it.

582
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:18,398
I'm going to put you to sleep.

583
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,110
Your eyelids are getting heavy.

584
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:29,117
I'm going to count from five to
one and your eyes will close.

585
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,870
Five, four,

586
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,414
three, two,

587
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,918
one.

588
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,128
You're asleep.

589
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:44,132
You're going into a deep,
deep sleep.

590
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:52,056
It's the day of the incident.

591
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,350
You and your
father are at a table.

592
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,895
What are you doing?

593
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,281
I'm... watching his hands.

594
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,328
- He is carving meat.
-Yes?

595
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:17,123
The knife flashes.

596
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,379
He looks with hatred
at me across the table.

597
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,216
His eyes flash like the knife.

598
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:32,096
He would like to draw the knife
across my throat.

599
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:38,645
| stare back at him,
holding his eyes.

600
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:45,485
My look is a challenge.

601
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,489
It enrages him.

602
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:54,953
He's going to strike.

603
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,748
It is he or I.

604
00:41:03,753 --> 00:41:06,047
| strike first.

605
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,681
I'll bleed you,
you filthy swine!

606
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,392
Why do you call
your father a swine?

607
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,021
He raped a young girl.

608
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:25,483
He? Your father?

609
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:30,530
- A girl of 17. Every night.
- What girl?

610
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,201
My mother.

611
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,073
Mother.

612
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,923
You'll remember nothing of this
when you wake.

613
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,676
Nothing, I'm going to wake you.

614
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,180
One, two, three, four, five.
Wake up!

615
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:40,433
<i>Eyes open! Wide awake!</i>

616
00:42:46,189 --> 00:42:47,231
Dr. Freud!

617
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,192
Dr. Freud!

618
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,121
Mother.

619
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,874
Mother.

620
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:12,668
No, dear, it's Martha.
Your wife.

621
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:23,346
Sigi?

622
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:27,016
Sigi. Dr. Breuer is here.

623
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:28,684
Breuer.

624
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,146
This is an honor.

625
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,690
| was making a call nearby
and thought I'd stop in.

626
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,150
What've you been doing
with yourself?

627
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,612
Between patients
and chess problems,

628
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:41,614
another article
for the Neurological Journal.

629
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:47,995
"On the Origin
of the Acoustic Nerve".

630
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,122
But this is pure anatomy.

631
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:54,293
It's good to be back with
experimentally proven facts.

632
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:57,922
| was homesick for neurology
and I didn't know it.

633
00:45:58,631 --> 00:46:00,633
What about Studies on Hysteria?

634
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,303
The discovery is yours.
| contributed nothing.

635
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,097
There's no reason
you should share the credit.

636
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,895
You look a bit peaked.
How's his appetite, Martha?

637
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,563
He eats hardly anything.

638
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,024
Sleeping properly?

639
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,484
Tosses all night, and cries out.

640
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,781
I'm going to examine him
here and now.

641
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,452
- Sit down. Open your shirt.
- No.

642
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,249
No. There's nothing wrong
with me, I assure you.

643
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,089
What is it then?

644
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:43,467
| understand you gave up
Fraulein Wolf's case.

645
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,677
Yes.

646
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,262
And Herr Brenner and Frau Jonas.

647
00:46:46,262 --> 00:46:49,098
- Yes.
- Surely they weren't all cured?

648
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:54,729
| couldn't go on prescribing
cold baths and massage.

649
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,733
I'm surprised
at your prescribing them at all.

650
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:02,278
- What else is there?
- Need you ask?

651
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,031
You should see
the Koertner girl.

652
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:06,991
She's living proof
of the effectiveness

653
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,409
of our hypnotic method.

654
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:11,037
Tell me, Freud,

655
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:14,665
when was the last time
you hypnotized a patient?

656
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,212
I... I don't remember.

657
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,506
Which case was it?

658
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,134
Eh... Which...?

659
00:47:27,094 --> 00:47:28,095
| know. It was...

660
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,515
It was the son of a general.
His name escapes me.

661
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:35,519
- You never told me about him.
- There's a little to tell.

662
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,313
| saw him once.
He was psychotic.

663
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,689
| was forced to commit him.

664
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,985
I'd like to know, why did you
stop in the middle of our work?

665
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:45,237
Meynert said,

666
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:48,282
"It's better to keep scorpions
locked up in darkness."

667
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,534
I'm forced to agree with him.

668
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:58,084
You were making such strides
forward, giant strides.

669
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:03,422
Did you know Meynert
had a heart attack?

670
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,384
| was called in yesterday
on consultation.

671
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,057
Will he recover?

672
00:48:14,183 --> 00:48:15,351
Matter of weeks or days.

673
00:48:16,811 --> 00:48:19,772
- Should I give him any message?
- No.

674
00:48:23,109 --> 00:48:26,570
Well, I must be on my way.
I've calls to make.

675
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:27,571
Martha.

676
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:33,619
There's nothing wrong
with him physically.

677
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:34,703
Thank heaven.

678
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,581
- How is Mathilda?
- Very well, thank you.

679
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,584
She's been after me
to take a holiday.

680
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:43,879
| can't even get Sigmund away
for an afternoon in the country.

681
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,132
That's the penalty for being
a doctor's wife.

682
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,592
Let me hear from you.

683
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:59,186
You sent for him, didn't you?

684
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,188
Didn't you?

685
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,400
Yes. I thought you might be ill.

686
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:09,155
What is it? I can't bear
to see you so unhappy.

687
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:11,407
- Won't you tell me?
- There's nothing wrong with me.

688
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:18,414
For Dr. Freud.

689
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:25,254
Sigi, a coachman is waiting.

690
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,185
Professor Meynert.
What does he want?

691
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,147
He's critically ill.
Breuer just told me.

692
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,526
The arrogance of the man.
"Come immediately".

693
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,904
He's dying, Sigi.

694
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,867
How amazed he must be
at the thought.

695
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,163
He always took himself
for Jehovah.

696
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,090
Freud?

697
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,259
Come in.

698
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,265
Closer.

699
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,100
Come closer.

700
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,272
I've read all your pieces
in the Neurological Journal.

701
00:50:26,315 --> 00:50:29,568
Your style has become
more sober, less belligerent.

702
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,113
You've learned how
to set forth your views

703
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:34,240
without wounding anyone.

704
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,536
In short, they're fit
for the waste basket.

705
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,455
- If you asked me here...
- Spare a dying man.

706
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,210
Breuer says that you've
given up the idea

707
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,295
of proving the
existence of hysteria.

708
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:50,214
A pity.

709
00:50:50,631 --> 00:50:52,424
| could have settled
the question

710
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:54,593
by presenting you with
a classic case.

711
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,596
Who?

712
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:00,182
Myself.

713
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,269
| have a whole complex
of symptoms.

714
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:08,732
Migraines, night terrors,
even paralysis.

715
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:12,111
Remember how I carried my right
hand-thumb

716
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,946
hooked around a waistcoat button

717
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,323
as though I was having
my portrait painted?

718
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,034
You never suspected, did you?

719
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,081
Did you know this when you
drove me away from your clinic?

720
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:28,502
| knew it before Charcot.
I've known it for 20 years.

721
00:51:29,003 --> 00:51:33,424
And yet you held me up to
ridicule before our colleagues?

722
00:51:35,009 --> 00:51:37,553
Ham was accursed by his father
for seeing him naked.

723
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,766
You're my spiritual son.

724
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:49,315
I'm not sleeping.
I'm gathering my energies.

725
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,277
Sit down. Don't interrupt.

726
00:52:01,285 --> 00:52:02,703
Neurotics form a brotherhood.

727
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,956
They learn to recognize each
other as I did you.

728
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,586
They have only one rule: Silence
in the presence of the enemy.

729
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:12,755
Our common enemy,

730
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,508
the normal people who would
knock our deformities,

731
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:17,509
torment and degrade us.

732
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,429
You belong to the brotherhood.

733
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,058
| feared you because you seemed
determined to betray us.

734
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:27,019
So I did what I could
to discredit you.

735
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:29,938
My life has been a sham.

736
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:32,650
| misused my talents,

737
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:35,069
hiding the truth
even from myself.

738
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,821
| suppressed my real being.

739
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,115
The result,

740
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,953
I'm dying in a state of pride
and ignorance.

741
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,456
| don't know who I am.

742
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:50,918
It's not I who lived my life,
but another,

743
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,837
the creation of my vanity.

744
00:52:56,382 --> 00:52:59,510
Break the silence.
Do what you set out to do.

745
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,971
Betray us. We need a traitor.

746
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:07,434
Go to the heart of our darkness.
Hunt out the dragon.

747
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:13,816
Angels and saints slay dragons.
| am neither.

748
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,860
If you lack the strength,
make a pact with the Devil.

749
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:19,780
What a splendid thing
to descend to hell

750
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,490
and light your torch
from its fires?

751
00:53:23,242 --> 00:53:24,326
Farewell.

752
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,622
Farewell.

753
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,426
Yes? What is it?

754
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:08,347
| would like to speak
to His Excellency, the General.

755
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:10,557
This house is closed.

756
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:13,519
His Excellency is living
in Salzburg now.

757
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:15,687
And his son Carl?

758
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:19,024
Herr Carl is dead.

759
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:22,653
He's dead?

760
00:55:24,488 --> 00:55:28,659
Yes, he died of
pneumonia six months ago.

761
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:35,874
- Did he die here?
- No.

762
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,668
Where?

763
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,295
In an asylum?

764
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:44,424
Yes, if it's
any business of yours.

765
00:55:52,808 --> 00:55:54,142
God, no...

766
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:03,193
Forgive me, Carl.

767
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,001
What an unpredictable fellow
you are.

768
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,838
You divorce yourself from
psychology for an entire year,

769
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,465
then, two weeks
after taking it up again.

770
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,801
You formulate a general
theory of neurosis.

771
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:31,972
That on the basis of a single
experience, your own.

772
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:36,143
No, Breuer. On the basis
of all the cases we've observed.

773
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,105
For instance,
about Greta Hubner?

774
00:56:41,565 --> 00:56:44,693
Music come through the window
of her dying father's room.

775
00:56:45,444 --> 00:56:48,697
She longs to be moving
to its rhythm in a man's arms.

776
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,158
Certainly sexual associations

777
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:52,868
can be found in almost
every case,

778
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,621
if you look for them
hard enough.

779
00:56:56,121 --> 00:57:00,250
I'm not denying the importance
of sexuality in all our lives

780
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,586
as a contributing factor,
but you'll never convince me

781
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:04,338
it's the one
and only cause of neurosis.

782
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,550
This theory is based on facts.

783
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,136
We pursued it together.

784
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:14,139
Now when you see where it's
leading, you shrink from it.

785
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:19,478
I've been practicing medicine
for over 15 years.

786
00:57:19,478 --> 00:57:22,272
Listening to secrets of the
bedchamber is a routine chore.

787
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,523
Don't take me for a prude.

788
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,984
Repression works
in the unconscious.

789
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,236
Against what?

790
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,155
Against an instinct
that nature has given us?

791
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:32,074
Is nature at war with herself?

792
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:36,662
At war with our society
which would collapse in a day

793
00:57:36,662 --> 00:57:38,705
if sexuality were allowed
free expression.

794
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:42,376
My concern is not
with the mores of society.

795
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:44,044
I'm a physician.

796
00:57:44,044 --> 00:57:45,837
In my mind, facts take
precedence over theory.

797
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,216
The emotional conflicts
of many of my patients

798
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,343
are not sexual in origin.
That's that.

799
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:53,512
Which patients?

800
00:57:55,347 --> 00:57:56,431
Cecily, for one.

801
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,185
You'd be hard put to unearth
an erotic element in her case.

802
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,689
Maybe you haven't
gone far enough.

803
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,441
She's completely unaware of
herself as a woman.

804
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:07,484
Her body's asleep.

805
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:13,407
If this is your challenge to my
theory, could I see her again?

806
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,828
| don't suppose
it would do any harm.

807
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:21,581
Cecily, I want you to try again.

808
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:25,752
Think back to the first time you
had trouble with your vision.

809
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:27,796
When was it?

810
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,173
| don't remember.

811
00:58:31,675 --> 00:58:32,676
You angry with me?

812
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,429
Never, Cecily.

813
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:38,807
How could I be? Now...

814
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:41,435
Where were you when
you had trouble seeing

815
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:42,436
for the first time?

816
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,648
Italy, Naples.

817
00:58:48,567 --> 00:58:49,735
In that place.

818
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:51,737
Which place?

819
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:58,577
- Hospital, they took me there.
- What for?

820
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,039
To identify...

821
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:04,875
his body.

822
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,336
What time did your father die?

823
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:10,589
One o'clock in the morning.

824
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,632
Where were you then?

825
00:59:13,175 --> 00:59:15,844
| was in my hotel room, alone.

826
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,767
They woke me
with their knocking on the door.

827
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,227
Louder. Louder.

828
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,691
| thought they'd break down
the door!

829
00:59:29,691 --> 00:59:30,692
Who, Cecily?

830
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:34,488
The doctors.

831
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:38,784
They came to tell me
about my father.

832
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,623
Breuer...

833
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:47,125
Doctors leaving the hospital
to report a death?

834
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,505
Go on, my child.

835
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:54,382
They told me they came
to take me to the hospital.

836
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:27,582
They took me down
the hall to his room.

837
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:32,963
They were playing music
for the patients.

838
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,090
| couldn't bear it!

839
01:00:38,218 --> 01:00:39,845
There were other doctors there.

840
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:46,476
One of them said that
my father was dead.

841
01:00:53,525 --> 01:00:55,610
There were nurses
who were staring at me.

842
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:58,238
They looked so funny.

843
01:00:59,239 --> 01:01:01,116
The other doctors
were staring too.

844
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,202
“Look at him", they said.

845
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,663
"Is this your father?"

846
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:09,541
I couldn't look.

847
01:01:11,501 --> 01:01:12,627
| couldn't.

848
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:19,426
Cecily...

849
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:21,553
I'm going to wake you.

850
01:01:23,972 --> 01:01:26,766
You'll remember everything
you told me.

851
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:28,935
When you are awake,

852
01:01:29,728 --> 01:01:31,938
your lovely eyes will be able
to see clearly again.

853
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:37,652
Wake up, Cecily. Wake up. Now.

854
01:01:44,868 --> 01:01:46,786
You remember
what happened in the hospital.

855
01:01:48,496 --> 01:01:49,915
Now you can see, can't you?

856
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,183
There, there, Cecily.

857
01:02:09,392 --> 01:02:12,896
It all... takes time.

858
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:15,982
We'll try again another day.

859
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,071
I'll just put you back to sleep
to calm you.

860
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:23,406
Sleep, Cecily.

861
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,785
You are deeply asleep now.

862
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:28,662
At peace.

863
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:36,044
Breuer, I'd like to ask her
a few questions.

864
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:40,090
These sessions are very tiring.
We mustn't overdo it.

865
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,342
But she's so close
to the memory.

866
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:47,305
- Very well.
- Thank you.

867
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,934
Cecily,

868
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,853
you'll be able to hear
Dr. Freud.

869
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,146
He's going to question you.

870
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,485
Because I ask you to,
you'll answer Dr. Freud.

871
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:06,241
Cecily,
you're going back in time.

872
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,159
Back in time.

873
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:12,914
You're in Naples,
in your room, at the hotel.

874
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,791
It's night time.

875
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,961
There's a knock at the door.

876
01:03:19,546 --> 01:03:20,547
What do you do?

877
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,217
| get up. I light the lamp.

878
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,261
I open the door.

879
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,848
You open the door,
without knowing who's outside?

880
01:03:30,390 --> 01:03:31,850
But I know they're doctors.

881
01:03:32,309 --> 01:03:35,895
How do you know? Are you sure?

882
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:38,356
- Are they saying anything?
- Yes.

883
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:42,152
- Yes!
- What are they saying?

884
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:46,865
- Police! Open the door!
- What happens now?

885
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:48,325
Gently, Freud.

886
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,535
What happened?

887
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,621
They take me to the hospital.

888
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:56,374
Tell me about the nurses.
You said they were strange.

889
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,461
Their dresses...

890
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,214
In Italian hospitals,
nuns take care of the patients.

891
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:07,385
- It's a protestant hospital.
- In Naples?

892
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:10,555
- Yes.
- And they play music?

893
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,266
Yes, and it's horrible!

894
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,893
In a protestant hospital

895
01:04:14,893 --> 01:04:16,770
they played music
after midnight?

896
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,980
Yes, to insult my father!

897
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,734
You're not in a hospital.
Where are you?

898
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:24,194
| told you.

899
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:26,321
You're not in a hospital,
where are you?

900
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:30,158
It's a brothel! It's a brothel!

901
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,713
- My child, you can't...
- What happens then?

902
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:46,424
What happens?

903
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,551
They take me to the room...

904
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,395
where woman
are standing around the bed.

905
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:03,817
| hate them! I can see
the one who killed him!

906
01:05:04,818 --> 01:05:07,529
- How did she kill him?
- With lust.

907
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:10,490
He died in her arms.

908
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:16,955
They are forcing me
to look at him.

909
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:21,793
"Is this your father?
Do you recognize him?"

910
01:05:24,838 --> 01:05:25,839
| won't look.

911
01:05:27,006 --> 01:05:28,216
They force me.

912
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:34,347
There's lipstick on his mouth.

913
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,891
That's enough.
I'm going to awake you.

914
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,769
- Just a minute.
- She is still my patient.

915
01:05:39,769 --> 01:05:40,812
| know.

916
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:44,899
You are in Vienna now.

917
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,779
And when you awake, you'll
remember what you've said.

918
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,284
Cecily, wake up.

919
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:10,758
| can see!

920
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,929
| can see!

921
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:19,017
Clearly! Clearly!

922
01:06:23,188 --> 01:06:24,272
What have I said?

923
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:26,941
Go away!

924
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:30,153
You'd better leave us now.

925
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,407
In any case, Fraulein Koertner,

926
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,785
your vision will be normal
from now on.

927
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:39,621
Get out!

928
01:06:55,178 --> 01:06:57,639
Venice must be lovely
in the spring.

929
01:06:58,181 --> 01:07:00,517
| do envy Mathilda.

930
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:04,312
We haven't had a vacation in
two years. I kept promising her.

931
01:07:04,312 --> 01:07:06,523
Mathilda finally
put her foot down.

932
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,858
- When are you leaving?
- Tonight.

933
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,693
Tonight?

934
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:15,281
Could you to take over
my practice for me?

935
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:17,742
Of course, yes.

936
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,453
Come with me on my calls,

937
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,747
I'll introduce you to the ones
who need regular attention.

938
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:26,960
Is Fraulein Koertner among them?

939
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,378
No.

940
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,006
Cecily is cured.
You'll see for yourself.

941
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,550
What a magnificent recovery.

942
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:37,262
The last symptom disappeared
March 7th, five weeks ago.

943
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:40,932
Now she moves as freely
and gracefully as a young deer.

944
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:44,852
Thank you, Freud.
I'll pick you up at two o'clock.

945
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:45,937
Fine.

946
01:07:54,821 --> 01:07:55,863
Strange.

947
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,157
What's strange?

948
01:07:59,409 --> 01:08:01,452
It's not like Breuer
this sudden departure.

949
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:04,539
He always plans so far ahead.

950
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:09,586
Did you notice the carnation
in his buttonhole?

951
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:14,382
Mathilda tells me that he gets
flowers every other day

952
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,592
from one of his patients.

953
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:19,971
- Well?
- Her name is Cecily.

954
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:23,600
- So?
- Mathilda's no fool.

955
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:11,606
Bravo, Cecily! Magnificent!

956
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:13,024
Thank you, Dr. Breuer.

957
01:09:14,776 --> 01:09:16,861
Dr. Freud,
how nice to see you again.

958
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:19,447
My behavior was unforgivable
the last time we met.

959
01:09:19,447 --> 01:09:22,867
- Not at all.
- That was before I was cured.

960
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,038
Is this your knitting, Cecily?

961
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,915
To keep some
poor baby's feet warm.

962
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,085
- One of your charities?
- Such a cold word, charity.

963
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:35,755
You didn't tell me
where you were going on holiday.

964
01:09:37,465 --> 01:09:40,468
- I'm going to Venice.
- Alone?

965
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:44,514
- My wife and |I.
- Venice? You'll love it.

966
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:45,973
My poor father took me there.

967
01:09:46,599 --> 01:09:48,059
It will be like a
second honeymoon.

968
01:09:49,894 --> 01:09:53,231
Who knows, doctor,
for whom these may be.

969
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:03,282
We must be on our way. I only
stopped in to say goodbye.

970
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,910
| wish you happiness
with all my heart.

971
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:08,663
You have a heart?

972
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,166
I'm talking nonsense, Doctor.

973
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:14,585
| know how devotedly
you took care of me.

974
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:17,755
Won't you kiss me goodbye?

975
01:10:58,171 --> 01:10:59,172
Dr. Breuer?

976
01:11:12,894 --> 01:11:13,978
Freud...

977
01:11:34,499 --> 01:11:36,793
- I'm Dr. Torsch.
- Breuer.

978
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:40,546
Most unusual. She has
all the symptoms of labor.

979
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:45,259
She herself believes it.

980
01:11:45,301 --> 01:11:48,763
Yet she's not pregnant,
nor could she be.

981
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:56,938
Cecily.

982
01:11:57,688 --> 01:12:01,567
- Cecily, Cecily.
- I knew you'd come. Help me!

983
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:05,071
Yes, Cecily. Sleep, sleep.

984
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:07,824
Close your eyes,
close your eyes.

985
01:12:08,658 --> 01:12:12,578
You're falling asleep.
Deeply asleep.

986
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:13,579
A very deep sleep.

987
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:19,293
Cecily, do you know
what's happening to you?

988
01:12:21,629 --> 01:12:25,675
- I'm having a baby.
- You're not. You couldn't be!

989
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:29,387
| order you to stop thinking
these false thoughts.

990
01:12:30,304 --> 01:12:33,933
You're going to wake, and when
you do, they will be gone.

991
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:34,934
Forgotten.

992
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,188
Wake up, Cecily. Open your eyes.

993
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,509
Breuer...

994
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:12,054
- You can't leave her like this.
- I must.

995
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,472
Must?

996
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:14,765
You're her doctor.
She needs you.

997
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,059
It's Mathilda.

998
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,978
She imagines there's something
between Cecily and me.

999
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,605
That I'm in love with the girl.

1000
01:13:20,605 --> 01:13:22,273
| must go to preserve
my marriage!

1001
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,372
Martha.

1002
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,633
What are you doing, dear?

1003
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,302
| was reading
one of your manuscripts.

1004
01:13:53,054 --> 01:13:54,639
Is there any reason
why I shouldn't?

1005
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:56,933
I'd rather you didn't.

1006
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,226
Why?

1007
01:13:59,852 --> 01:14:01,854
Because of the nature
of the material.

1008
01:14:02,605 --> 01:14:04,774
It's for physicians to read.
Not one's wife.

1009
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,401
Your friends' wives
know all about it.

1010
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,820
| seem to be the only
one who doesn't.

1011
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:13,574
What are they saying?

1012
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,411
It's not so much what they say
as how they say it.

1013
01:14:18,329 --> 01:14:19,330
Slyly, in whispers.

1014
01:14:21,207 --> 01:14:22,792
Patients have left you, I know.

1015
01:14:24,752 --> 01:14:28,464
Is it because of the kind of
questions you put to them?

1016
01:14:29,674 --> 01:14:30,675
Maybe.

1017
01:14:31,801 --> 01:14:33,678
They say you're the
only doctor in Vienna

1018
01:14:33,678 --> 01:14:34,679
who asks such questions.

1019
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:37,139
In the world, perhaps.

1020
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,451
Martha, this is not
for your eyes.

1021
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:04,875
How can you, you of all men...

1022
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:10,172
be interested in such... things?

1023
01:15:13,467 --> 01:15:16,345
Dear, I know it's hard
to understand,

1024
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:18,889
but you must trust me.

1025
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:20,641
| need your trust.

1026
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:25,730
My friends and their wives
only whisper about me today.

1027
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:27,898
Tomorrow they may stone me
in the streets.

1028
01:15:36,615 --> 01:15:37,616
| trust you.

1029
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,210
What is it, dear?

1030
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,046
Martha, papa had a stroke!

1031
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:53,466
He fell down in the street.

1032
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,842
They brought
him home unconscious.

1033
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,761
I think he's dying.

1034
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,305
- Sigi, your father.
- He's very bad.

1035
01:15:59,305 --> 01:16:00,890
He's been calling for you.
Hurry!

1036
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,435
| think papa is dying.

1037
01:16:10,649 --> 01:16:13,152
- Dr. Breuer...
- Yes, Herr. Freud?

1038
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:16,822
Breuer, I'm giving you my son.

1039
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:20,326
| want you to do for him,

1040
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:23,079
as I myself would like
to have done.

1041
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:28,626
With your help,
he has nothing to fear.

1042
01:18:13,814 --> 01:18:16,400
Sigi, what is it?

1043
01:18:17,193 --> 01:18:19,862
I... I couldn't go through
the gate.

1044
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:24,783
| wasn't... allowed.

1045
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,912
Darling, you were dreaming.

1046
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:31,665
Dreaming.

1047
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,796
Dr. Breuer is here.

1048
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:43,969
How are you feeling?

1049
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,764
| feel...

1050
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:52,853
| was in the midst of a dream.

1051
01:18:55,481 --> 01:18:57,066
"The eyes shall be closed".

1052
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,401
What does that mean?

1053
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,820
Mean?

1054
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,657
Nothing, I suppose,
if it was in a dream.

1055
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,160
Except dreams have a meaning.

1056
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,162
For whom?

1057
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:12,581
For the dreamer.

1058
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,000
To himself about himself.

1059
01:19:17,711 --> 01:19:18,796
But they speak in riddles.

1060
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:25,344
Could it be dreams are ideas
escaping from repression...

1061
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:27,930
in disguise?

1062
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,768
Everyone was mourning.

1063
01:19:33,477 --> 01:19:34,645
Everyone but me.

1064
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,690
| was in shirtsleeves
at my father's funeral.

1065
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,442
Why could I not mourn?
| loved him.

1066
01:19:42,987 --> 01:19:43,988
Or did I?

1067
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,574
The dream says I didn't.

1068
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:52,246
Stop torturing yourself.
Your father died happy.

1069
01:19:52,246 --> 01:19:54,498
You honored him.
You were a good son.

1070
01:19:54,498 --> 01:19:58,502
That's not what the sign says.
"The eyes shall be closed."

1071
01:19:59,586 --> 01:20:00,838
Whose eyes? My father's?

1072
01:20:01,630 --> 01:20:03,299
| was at his bedside.
| closed his.

1073
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:05,134
Of course you did.

1074
01:20:05,718 --> 01:20:07,094
Well then, whose? Mine?

1075
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:11,557
Mine...

1076
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:17,313
Everybody at the station
walked about with closed eyes.

1077
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:19,773
Mine were open.

1078
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,234
Brazenly open.

1079
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,322
That's...

1080
01:20:27,197 --> 01:20:29,325
That's why I wasn't allowed
through the gate.

1081
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:32,911
Now I understand!

1082
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:35,622
Understand what, my friend?

1083
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:39,626
The meaning of those words.
"The eyes shall be closed.”

1084
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,670
Remember?

1085
01:20:42,171 --> 01:20:44,923
The sons shall close their eyes
to the sins of the father.

1086
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:47,968
| broke the law.

1087
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:55,768
But what sin of his
couldn't I close my eyes to?

1088
01:20:59,021 --> 01:21:02,316
Breuer, take me back
to the cemetery.

1089
01:21:06,779 --> 01:21:07,780
What sin?

1090
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:11,033
What sin?

1091
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,951
What sin?

1092
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:30,844
It's happening.

1093
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:33,847
My...

1094
01:21:35,641 --> 01:21:37,518
my legs won't hold me.

1095
01:21:40,396 --> 01:21:42,815
- I can't.
- Come back to the carriage.

1096
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:52,825
Why?

1097
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:57,830
Why is it when I turn away
| feel myself again?

1098
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:00,624
Meynert was right.

1099
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:04,378
Yes, I'm a neurotic!
These are hysterical symptoms.

1100
01:22:04,378 --> 01:22:05,754
You're emotionally exhausted.

1101
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,215
| wonder... what...

1102
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:10,467
What terror,

1103
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:14,888
what hidden terror keeps me from
standing by my father's grave,

1104
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:17,391
and threatens my love for him?

1105
01:22:20,018 --> 01:22:21,437
What could the good man
have done?

1106
01:22:23,522 --> 01:22:26,150
Once, as a boy,
| was with him on the street.

1107
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:29,361
When some hoodlums called him
"dirty Jew"

1108
01:22:29,361 --> 01:22:30,863
and knocked his hat off.

1109
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:35,659
You know, all he did was pick it
up and walk on.

1110
01:22:37,161 --> 01:22:40,539
From that moment, I saw him
less as a God, more as a man,

1111
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,709
but I didn't hate him
for his weakness.

1112
01:22:44,751 --> 01:22:46,879
The memory must go further back.

1113
01:22:47,921 --> 01:22:51,508
Is it possible for a neurosis
to begin in childhood?

1114
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:52,509
Why not?

1115
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,053
That would put
the traumatic incident

1116
01:22:55,053 --> 01:22:57,431
before the awakening
of the sexual impulse.

1117
01:22:57,431 --> 01:22:59,475
Yes.

1118
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:03,270
Well, if that's true, my sexual
theory of neurosis collapses.

1119
01:23:03,937 --> 01:23:05,522
In which case, I'd be thankful.

1120
01:23:07,274 --> 01:23:08,859
You never believed in it,
did you?

1121
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:12,488
We close our eyes
to the infinite variety of life,

1122
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:15,073
when we try to reduce it
to a single law.

1123
01:23:15,866 --> 01:23:17,743
It was only a matter of time

1124
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:20,245
before some husband
appeared with a horsewhip.

1125
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:21,497
I'm not afraid of scandal.

1126
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:26,502
But how can I defend a theory
which is disproved in myself?

1127
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,713
Breuer, hypnotize me.

1128
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:32,549
Bring back the memory
about my father.

1129
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:36,345
Two weeks in the mountains
will cure all your ills.

1130
01:23:36,345 --> 01:23:38,472
I'm not seeking a cure.
| want an answer.

1131
01:23:38,472 --> 01:23:40,390
It's no use,
| won't accept the case.

1132
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,270
Which reminds me I want you
to treat Cecily Koertner.

1133
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,482
Her mother
came to see me last week.

1134
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,234
She had seen lots of doctors,

1135
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:52,236
but her condition
hasn't improved.

1136
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:54,321
Frau Koertner wanted me
to take the case again.

1137
01:23:55,072 --> 01:23:57,658
It's out of the question
for obvious reasons, so |I...

1138
01:23:58,617 --> 01:24:00,494
recommended you and she agreed.

1139
01:24:02,913 --> 01:24:05,207
Dr. Freud,
I'm so tired of being sick.

1140
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:09,419
At night, sometimes,

1141
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,381
| lie in the dark
and cry for hours.

1142
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,801
It's like a prison.

1143
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:21,557
Tell me, uh...

1144
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:25,727
did you have any illness
before your father's death?

1145
01:24:27,020 --> 01:24:29,022
The usual childhood ones.
Nothing very serious.

1146
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:30,524
Umhmm.

1147
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,151
Once when I was 14,
| was in bed for several weeks.

1148
01:24:33,151 --> 01:24:35,112
- Why?
- I couldn't walk.

1149
01:24:35,779 --> 01:24:38,907
My legs wouldn't support me.
The doctors didn't know why.

1150
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,579
It started after a fainting fit.
| collapsed on the street.

1151
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:45,080
Yes?

1152
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:47,708
| was out with father.

1153
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:50,002
It was Christmas time.

1154
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,962
He made me wait outside
while he went into a shop.

1155
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:53,714
He left you alone in the street?

1156
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:55,841
Yes.

1157
01:24:55,841 --> 01:24:58,010
When he came back,
| was lying on the pavement.

1158
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,345
Had anything happened
to frighten you?

1159
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:02,389
| don't think so,
| can't remember.

1160
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:04,641
You could, under hypnosis.

1161
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,945
Now I want you to
think about sleep.

1162
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:18,530
Only about sleep.

1163
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,284
Your lids are getting weighted.
Heavier and heavier.

1164
01:25:22,993 --> 01:25:25,787
Your breathing deeper and deeper
as in sleep.

1165
01:25:26,330 --> 01:25:28,373
Sleep. Go to sleep.

1166
01:25:31,918 --> 01:25:33,045
It's no use.

1167
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:37,424
Why do you fight it?
You were almost asleep.

1168
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:43,305
What would Breuer say if he knew
you'd put me to sleep?

1169
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:48,018
You see him sometimes,
don't you?

1170
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,019
Yes, I do.

1171
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:51,480
Does he ever ask about me?

1172
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,525
No.

1173
01:25:56,610 --> 01:25:59,029
You must put Dr. Breuer
out of your thoughts.

1174
01:25:59,029 --> 01:26:00,405
He'll never come here again.

1175
01:26:01,239 --> 01:26:03,492
So far as you're concerned,
he doesn't exist.

1176
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,787
Dead, like my father.

1177
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,582
You were very close
to your father, weren't you?

1178
01:26:11,875 --> 01:26:13,627
Yes, he was a wonderful man.

1179
01:26:15,379 --> 01:26:17,923
You were alone with him in
Naples. Where was your mother?

1180
01:26:18,507 --> 01:26:20,467
At home.
It was spring cleaning time.

1181
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,344
She didn't trust the servants.

1182
01:26:22,636 --> 01:26:24,429
Mother's got a
great sense of duty.

1183
01:26:25,722 --> 01:26:27,724
Father thought it was
one's duty to enjoy life.

1184
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:30,352
He took me everywhere.
We were always together.

1185
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,896
| even ran this house
when mother had her accident.

1186
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:35,232
What accident?

1187
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:42,197
She was out driving one day.
Her cart overturned.

1188
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,491
She hovered for some time
between life and death.

1189
01:26:44,491 --> 01:26:46,743
- How old were you then?
- Thirteen.

1190
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,247
It was the happiest time
of my life.

1191
01:26:51,331 --> 01:26:54,918
| didn't mean it like that!
Of course I missed mother.

1192
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,879
But... I don't know.

1193
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:01,383
Father let me arrange
the flowers at table

1194
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:02,384
and seat the guests.

1195
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,387
| could put up my hair
and wear jewelry.

1196
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:08,098
We made a very handsome couple
everybody said.

1197
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:11,017
Six nights of the week
and up till all hours.

1198
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,396
- And the seventh?
- Father played Tarock.

1199
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,148
He loved that.

1200
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:19,943
| suppose a serious man like you
doesn't approve of card playing.

1201
01:27:19,985 --> 01:27:21,820
It happens to be
my favorite game.

1202
01:27:22,654 --> 01:27:24,156
| must revise my idea of you.

1203
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,202
You said it was the happiest
moment in your life.

1204
01:27:29,202 --> 01:27:30,328
Then your mother came home.

1205
01:27:32,539 --> 01:27:33,623
And everything was changed.

1206
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,210
It was back to hair ribbons
and bed at nine o'clock.

1207
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,173
Mother's a German,
a soldier's daughter.

1208
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,634
She and father come
from quite different worlds.

1209
01:27:45,218 --> 01:27:46,762
Not even their religions
were the same.

1210
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:49,139
She insisted I be brought up
as a prostitute.

1211
01:27:51,433 --> 01:27:55,061
Oh... I meant Protestant.

1212
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,480
My tongue got tangled up.

1213
01:27:58,523 --> 01:28:02,277
You said the hospital in Naples
was a Protestant hospital.

1214
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:05,405
When in fact it was
a house of prostitution.

1215
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:11,077
Do you remember when you first
heard that word?

1216
01:28:12,537 --> 01:28:15,165
How do you know when you first
heard a word, Dr. Freuer?

1217
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:29,346
Is she in love with you, too?

1218
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:32,224
You could call it that.

1219
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:34,434
What are you going
to do about it?

1220
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:35,560
Nothing.

1221
01:28:36,394 --> 01:28:38,104
Because of her feeling
for Breuer,

1222
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,732
| wasn't able to hypnotize her.

1223
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:44,069
To her, the act has
erotic significance.

1224
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:46,112
She felt she was
being unfaithful.

1225
01:28:47,405 --> 01:28:50,617
But now, any day, she'll ask me.

1226
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,286
How can you lend yourself
to such a thing

1227
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:54,746
if that's what it means to her?

1228
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,624
There is no other way
than hypnosis

1229
01:28:57,624 --> 01:28:58,625
to reach the unconscious.

1230
01:28:59,751 --> 01:29:01,461
Dr. Breuer gave up the case.

1231
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:04,089
She's ill. She needs help.

1232
01:29:05,006 --> 01:29:07,634
She's only ill
for a man's attention.

1233
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,554
To the extent of blindness
and paralysis?

1234
01:29:10,554 --> 01:29:12,222
No, Martha.

1235
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:14,558
Her attachments
are also symptoms.

1236
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:17,477
Is falling in love a symptom?

1237
01:29:19,604 --> 01:29:21,439
Before me, it was Breuer.

1238
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:24,901
Was he the first?

1239
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:30,282
Maybe we're both reflections

1240
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,993
of someone else's image.

1241
01:29:33,827 --> 01:29:37,289
An original love, which for some
reason, she's repressed.

1242
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,000
| wonder.

1243
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:43,795
| thought love was between
a man and a woman

1244
01:29:43,795 --> 01:29:45,005
who were meant for each other.

1245
01:29:45,672 --> 01:29:46,840
What about us?

1246
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,552
Are we reflections
of others in our past?

1247
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:55,807
It may be you bear a likeness
to some image in my heart,

1248
01:29:55,807 --> 01:29:56,808
some forgotten image.

1249
01:30:03,273 --> 01:30:06,568
You said your father gave him to
you on March the 7th.

1250
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:07,736
Was that a special day?

1251
01:30:08,695 --> 01:30:11,281
| don't think so.

1252
01:30:11,865 --> 01:30:14,284
| always liked to celebrate
the day papa gave him to me.

1253
01:30:15,243 --> 01:30:17,787
And nothing special
happened on that day?

1254
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:21,625
- Well...
- What?

1255
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,335
I'd made mother very angry.

1256
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,337
Papa had taken me to the ballet.

1257
01:30:25,879 --> 01:30:27,881
At intermission,
we went around backstage

1258
01:30:27,881 --> 01:30:29,758
to the dressing room
of one of the dancers.

1259
01:30:30,383 --> 01:30:32,677
She was beautiful
and smelled so nice.

1260
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,513
Papa told her
| was a dancer too,

1261
01:30:35,931 --> 01:30:38,683
and she laughed and said:
"Your daddy loves dancers."

1262
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:41,978
| couldn't wait to get home
and paint my face like hers!

1263
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,272
| used my watercolors.

1264
01:30:45,482 --> 01:30:46,483
Suddenly mother came in.

1265
01:30:48,902 --> 01:30:50,695
What are you doing?

1266
01:30:50,695 --> 01:30:53,031
Don't you dare paint your face!

1267
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,119
| burst into tears.

1268
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,789
Papa picked me up,
and to comfort me,

1269
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:02,749
promised me the doll
the next day.

1270
01:31:03,959 --> 01:31:04,960
It was March the 7th.

1271
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:09,631
What sort of women
paint their faces?

1272
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,093
Actresses, dancers...

1273
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:15,220
And?

1274
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,639
Prostitutes?

1275
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,100
When did you first
hear that word?

1276
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,228
| was about nine years old,
| think.

1277
01:31:24,354 --> 01:31:26,022
| was coming along the hall

1278
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:27,691
and I heard shouting
in the drawing room.

1279
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,359
Mother was saying to Lucy,
our maid...

1280
01:31:29,818 --> 01:31:32,529
I've got eyes in my head!
| know what's been going on.

1281
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:34,280
Pack your things
and get out of here.

1282
01:31:34,823 --> 01:31:35,907
Get out of this house!

1283
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,702
You're nothing but a prostitute.

1284
01:31:39,661 --> 01:31:41,371
Lucy left the same day.

1285
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:42,998
| was sad.
We were friends, like sisters.

1286
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:45,166
She always had time
to play with me.

1287
01:32:08,857 --> 01:32:09,858
Father liked her too.

1288
01:32:10,442 --> 01:32:13,069
He said:
"You're a dear little girl."

1289
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,573
Why do you suppose your
mother called her that name?

1290
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:20,243
- I don't know.
- Concentrate.

1291
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:22,620
Your father and Lucy.

1292
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,372
Together.

1293
01:32:25,498 --> 01:32:26,499
What do you see?

1294
01:32:30,503 --> 01:32:31,671
A..

1295
01:32:32,797 --> 01:32:34,466
- Tower.
- A what?

1296
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:37,927
- A red tower.
-Yes?

1297
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,305
Red Tower Street.

1298
01:32:41,598 --> 01:32:42,766
Have you been there?

1299
01:32:43,933 --> 01:32:46,644
I'm sorry, Dr. Freud.
I'm being very frivolous.

1300
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,147
| don't even know
why it came to my mind.

1301
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:53,902
Tell me...

1302
01:32:55,278 --> 01:32:57,614
what do you know
about Red Tower Street?

1303
01:32:59,199 --> 01:33:01,201
It's the street where
| fainted that day with papa.

1304
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,753
You fainted in Red Tower Street?

1305
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:15,965
It can't be washed out.

1306
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:18,760
What can't be washed out?

1307
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,555
That's what mother said.

1308
01:33:22,555 --> 01:33:24,557
I'd spilled some wine
on the counterpane.

1309
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:27,102
She said: "You stupid girl,
how could you be so careless?"

1310
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:28,269
It can't be washed out."

1311
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:31,856
It looked like blood.

1312
01:33:35,235 --> 01:33:36,402
Did that upset you?

1313
01:33:38,238 --> 01:33:40,865
I... I suppose it must have,

1314
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:44,077
because I dreamt about it.
Mother's words.

1315
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,455
And the tower!
That's where I saw the tower!

1316
01:33:48,248 --> 01:33:49,582
Can you remember your dream?

1317
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,502
| was walking along
by the seashore,

1318
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:55,630
and suddenly I saw
a tall, round, red tower.

1319
01:33:56,089 --> 01:33:58,591
Above the entrance there was an
inscription and a coat of arms.

1320
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:01,761
A funny one. A staff with
a snake wound around it.

1321
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:04,889
- And the inscription?
- I don't remember.

1322
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:08,184
There was a woman.

1323
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:09,894
Her body was painted
with marvelous images.

1324
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,437
She could have been an Egyptian.

1325
01:34:17,318 --> 01:34:20,613
A tall, handsome man came up
to her in full evening dress.

1326
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:21,906
The woman said...

1327
01:34:21,906 --> 01:34:23,533
I'm Frau Putiphar.

1328
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,869
She tried to fit on his finger

1329
01:34:25,869 --> 01:34:27,370
a wedding band
of the thinnest metal,

1330
01:34:27,370 --> 01:34:28,872
but his own gold one
prevented it.

1331
01:34:29,914 --> 01:34:31,249
Hers slipped off
and rolled away.

1332
01:34:32,709 --> 01:34:34,169
At that, the man turned and ran.

1333
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:37,255
He stumbled and fell
to the ground as if dead.

1334
01:34:37,255 --> 01:34:39,132
| ran to help him.

1335
01:34:39,132 --> 01:34:41,467
When I got there, I found
only a heap of clothes.

1336
01:34:43,553 --> 01:34:46,014
A window in the tower opened
and a woman looked out.

1337
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:47,640
It was my mother.

1338
01:34:49,434 --> 01:34:51,811
She pointed threateningly
to the painted girl and said:

1339
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:55,690
"Blood will tell, my girl.
It can't be washed out.

1340
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:57,275
No matter what you do."

1341
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:09,037
What did you say that
the painted woman's name was?

1342
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:13,249
- Frau Putiphar.
- You say Putiphar.

1343
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,753
Isn't Putiphar
the character in the Bible?

1344
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,631
She used the French
pronunciation.

1345
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:22,800
Can you think of another word
like Putiphar?

1346
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:24,552
Putain.

1347
01:35:24,552 --> 01:35:26,804
Putain. Which means
"prostitute” in French.

1348
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,474
Who was Frau Putiphar?

1349
01:35:32,101 --> 01:35:33,937
She tried to seduce Joseph
in the Bible.

1350
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,272
He rejected her and ran away.

1351
01:35:36,689 --> 01:35:38,483
- And then?
- She took revenge.

1352
01:35:39,692 --> 01:35:40,693
Who is Joseph?

1353
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,445
What do you mean?

1354
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:45,490
Do you know anyone
by the name of Joseph?

1355
01:35:47,867 --> 01:35:50,203
Dr. Joseph Breuer.

1356
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:54,749
The Joseph in your dream didn't
make love to the painted girl.

1357
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:59,128
Who is she? Do you know
any girl who paints herself?

1358
01:36:01,881 --> 01:36:02,882
She was an Egyptian.

1359
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:06,010
What did your mother say
to that Egyptian?

1360
01:36:08,388 --> 01:36:11,140
"Blood will tell.
It can't be washed out."

1361
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,394
What your mother
said to you yesterday,

1362
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:16,604
it can't be washed out.

1363
01:36:18,356 --> 01:36:19,482
It isn't me.

1364
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,657
I'm the painted girl.

1365
01:36:30,285 --> 01:36:33,037
Who was rejected by Joseph
and therefore hates him.

1366
01:36:34,330 --> 01:36:35,331
| don't hate him.

1367
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:37,959
You can't admit it to yourself.
Not yet.

1368
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,878
But in your dream
you made him die.

1369
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:45,758
| can't bear to be this person.

1370
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,553
None of us can bear
facing all our wishes...

1371
01:36:49,304 --> 01:36:50,305
so we repress them.

1372
01:36:51,973 --> 01:36:54,934
Do you realize what's happened
in this room today?

1373
01:36:56,436 --> 01:36:59,480
You and I have found our way

1374
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:02,150
into the unconscious
without hypnosis.

1375
01:37:03,151 --> 01:37:05,111
Apparent coincidences,

1376
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:07,905
slips of the tongue
have been the signposts.

1377
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:09,907
Your dream,

1378
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,744
with its symbolic language,

1379
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:16,164
has told you the truth about
your feelings for Dr. Breuer.

1380
01:37:16,164 --> 01:37:17,832
But I had this dream long ago

1381
01:37:18,499 --> 01:37:21,753
or others like it, long before
| even met Dr. Breuer.

1382
01:37:23,171 --> 01:37:26,174
A tower, and sea and women.

1383
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:29,344
Was there a man in those dreams?

1384
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:33,097
Yes.

1385
01:37:33,097 --> 01:37:34,098
There was?

1386
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:37,935
Could you describe him?

1387
01:37:38,478 --> 01:37:39,520
No.

1388
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:41,773
No, I can't.

1389
01:37:44,984 --> 01:37:48,321
My precious hour gone, so soon.

1390
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:54,619
Ten o'clock, tomorrow.

1391
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:20,561
Her father.

1392
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:24,232
Is it her father's figure

1393
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:25,858
which moves through
that recurrent dream?

1394
01:38:28,277 --> 01:38:30,196
Is he the phantom husband

1395
01:38:30,196 --> 01:38:33,282
by whom she bore the doll,
her imaginary child?

1396
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:36,411
No.

1397
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:39,247
Unthinkable!

1398
01:38:40,873 --> 01:38:41,999
Not her father!

1399
01:38:47,839 --> 01:38:49,132
You're making progress.

1400
01:38:49,882 --> 01:38:53,261
Let's go on. Where did we leave
off? Where should we start?

1401
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:56,305
Let's go back to
Red Tower Street.

1402
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:59,350
Christmas time.
You're waiting for your father.

1403
01:39:01,978 --> 01:39:03,646
You said it was important,

1404
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:06,107
my remembering
what made me faint. But why?

1405
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:09,652
Could remembering that
help me to walk again?

1406
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:13,448
That was the occasion
of your first attack.

1407
01:39:13,948 --> 01:39:15,908
If we can find the cause
of that attack,

1408
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:18,536
you will be cured
once and for all.

1409
01:39:19,704 --> 01:39:22,874
Hypnotize me. You may today.

1410
01:39:23,374 --> 01:39:25,710
- No.
- I'll reveal my every secret.

1411
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:28,129
No. No more hypnosis.

1412
01:39:29,005 --> 01:39:30,465
We've found a better method.

1413
01:39:31,674 --> 01:39:35,761
Think of Red Tower Street.
Say whatever comes to your mind.

1414
01:39:35,761 --> 01:39:37,555
- But I can't see you.
- I know.

1415
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,809
Hold nothing back,
however trivial it may seem.

1416
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:46,606
Traffic, shops, people.

1417
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:48,900
Where will this lead us?

1418
01:39:49,358 --> 01:39:51,277
Nowhere if you censor
your thoughts.

1419
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:53,404
Take the censor off guard.

1420
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,531
Right now,
what are you thinking?

1421
01:39:56,282 --> 01:39:58,284
- Tarock cards.
-Yes?

1422
01:39:58,284 --> 01:40:00,411
Do you play Tarock
with your wife at home?

1423
01:40:00,953 --> 01:40:02,497
No, at the house of a colleague.

1424
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,458
And he tells his wife
that he plays at your house.

1425
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:07,502
All men are alike.

1426
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:09,795
Go on.

1427
01:40:11,088 --> 01:40:13,257
- I just thought...
- What?

1428
01:40:13,257 --> 01:40:15,843
No, it's nothing,
it's not important.

1429
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:17,637
| was just remembering.

1430
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:21,224
Papa once promised
to take me to the opera.

1431
01:40:21,224 --> 01:40:22,725
I'd been looking forward
to it all day.

1432
01:40:23,309 --> 01:40:25,311
He came home
and said he'd forgotten

1433
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:27,647
and he had to go
and play Tarock with friends.

1434
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:31,567
| started to cry
and went upstairs to my room.

1435
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,153
That's all.

1436
01:40:35,154 --> 01:40:36,489
Surely that's not all.

1437
01:40:37,657 --> 01:40:40,576
Close your eyes.
What do you see?

1438
01:40:42,411 --> 01:40:44,455
- Running.
-Yes?

1439
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,291
I'm running through the streets.

1440
01:40:47,291 --> 01:40:50,628
I'd been forbidden
to go outside alone at night.

1441
01:40:50,628 --> 01:40:53,089
- You were alone?
- Yes.

1442
01:40:53,089 --> 01:40:54,131
No.

1443
01:40:54,757 --> 01:40:56,509
No, there was papa.

1444
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:58,469
| was following papa.

1445
01:40:59,011 --> 01:41:01,013
| heard the front door slam.

1446
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,099
If he'd been going
where he'd said,

1447
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:04,892
he would've taken the carriage.

1448
01:41:08,396 --> 01:41:10,022
| was so afraid he'd see me,

1449
01:41:10,022 --> 01:41:11,691
| kept slipping into doorways.

1450
01:41:11,691 --> 01:41:14,151
Where did he go?

1451
01:41:14,151 --> 01:41:17,405
| knew I shouldn't
follow him any farther,

1452
01:41:17,405 --> 01:41:18,489
but then I did.

1453
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:20,283
To Red Tower Street?

1454
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:25,705
He held her by the arm
and smiled into her face.

1455
01:41:25,705 --> 01:41:27,873
A shiny, painted creature!

1456
01:41:28,583 --> 01:41:32,378
Papa had preferred
her company to mine!

1457
01:41:32,378 --> 01:41:35,590
| felt ill and dizzy
and then I fainted.

1458
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:39,427
| couldn't face it,
so I fainted!

1459
01:41:41,137 --> 01:41:43,055
The same thing
had happened in Naples.

1460
01:41:43,055 --> 01:41:44,390
He lied to me!

1461
01:41:47,685 --> 01:41:49,770
While mother
was lying in hospital,

1462
01:41:50,688 --> 01:41:53,232
he was out making love
to streetwalkers!

1463
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:55,776
| hated him!

1464
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:58,571
| hate him, I hate men!

1465
01:42:03,409 --> 01:42:04,994
You've found it!

1466
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:06,662
You've found the memory!

1467
01:42:08,414 --> 01:42:09,457
Walk.

1468
01:42:53,292 --> 01:42:54,919
Why is she not cured?

1469
01:42:55,628 --> 01:42:59,048
Everything pointed to her
experience in Red Tower Street

1470
01:42:59,048 --> 01:43:00,716
as the cause of her neurosis.

1471
01:43:01,801 --> 01:43:04,553
But it could only have
reflected some earlier trauma.

1472
01:43:05,554 --> 01:43:06,597
Earlier?

1473
01:43:07,306 --> 01:43:08,974
Before adolescence?

1474
01:43:09,809 --> 01:43:11,727
Again, the tormenting
contradiction.

1475
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:12,812
Breuer pointed out,

1476
01:43:13,813 --> 01:43:15,773
How can sexual instinct

1477
01:43:15,773 --> 01:43:19,360
become the object of repression
before it is awakened?

1478
01:43:20,403 --> 01:43:22,571
How, in the innocence
of childhood,

1479
01:43:22,571 --> 01:43:24,907
could a sexual experience
be traumatic?

1480
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:28,494
Say he is the victim
of an adult's aggression,

1481
01:43:28,994 --> 01:43:31,122
unless it entailed pain
or violence,

1482
01:43:31,122 --> 01:43:32,915
it would mean nothing
to the child

1483
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:36,627
for the good and simple
reason that he has no sexuality.

1484
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:40,297
But the experience is not
repressed at the time,

1485
01:43:40,756 --> 01:43:42,508
only later, in adolescence.

1486
01:43:43,551 --> 01:43:46,095
The memory arouses
his sexual excitement,

1487
01:43:46,762 --> 01:43:49,140
excitement which
morality condemns.

1488
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:51,600
It is only then that
he feels shame and guilt...

1489
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:56,272
and the memory
becomes intolerable.

1490
01:43:57,982 --> 01:44:00,526
An elaborate structure,
and what is it based on?

1491
01:44:00,526 --> 01:44:01,610
A half dozen cases?

1492
01:44:03,195 --> 01:44:04,488
There will be more.

1493
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:06,323
Two at least.

1494
01:44:07,491 --> 01:44:08,492
Whose?

1495
01:44:09,493 --> 01:44:10,703
Cecily's for one.

1496
01:44:14,039 --> 01:44:15,040
Indeed?

1497
01:44:16,709 --> 01:44:18,586
Her father was
the man she loved.

1498
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:21,088
You only reflected his image.

1499
01:44:22,339 --> 01:44:25,718
Such a fixation must have
sprung from an erotic incident.

1500
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:29,346
Why did she fall ill again
after you had cured her?

1501
01:44:29,972 --> 01:44:32,767
Because the memory of that
incident never came to light.

1502
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:36,145
And the second case?

1503
01:44:40,065 --> 01:44:41,066
Mine.

1504
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:46,322
| can feel it moving inside me
like a shake.

1505
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:52,828
<i>The memory
of something I witnessed...</i>

1506
01:44:54,705 --> 01:44:56,624
between my father and my sister.

1507
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,422
| reach down.
| almost touch its coils...

1508
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:06,884
and then my courage fails

1509
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:11,680
and it escapes
into another dark corner.

1510
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:15,976
Freud, I say beware.

1511
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:19,647
Your own morbid imagination,
that's the snake.

1512
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:22,775
Your sexual theory
has become an obsession.

1513
01:45:22,775 --> 01:45:24,693
To support it, you'd drag your
father's memory

1514
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:26,529
through the mire.

1515
01:45:26,529 --> 01:45:28,531
In the name of whatever
is holy to you, give it up!

1516
01:45:28,823 --> 01:45:31,325
In science, there is nothing
holy but the truth.

1517
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:34,078
Yes, in science,
but we are physicians first.

1518
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:37,873
Truth is a dangerous
prescription,

1519
01:45:38,374 --> 01:45:41,043
to be administered with
the same caution as strychnine.

1520
01:45:42,419 --> 01:45:43,671
Its effects can be lethal.

1521
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:47,132
Cecily is your patient now.

1522
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,593
It is not my province
to interfere with

1523
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:52,972
your methods of treatment
but I plead with you,

1524
01:45:53,848 --> 01:45:56,809
do not make this girl
the touchstone of your theory.

1525
01:46:09,530 --> 01:46:11,198
What are you doing?

1526
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:13,534
Don't you dare paint your face!

1527
01:46:18,330 --> 01:46:19,373
Let her be!

1528
01:46:19,999 --> 01:46:22,251
- Papa! Papa!
- My baby...

1529
01:46:26,922 --> 01:46:28,841
He carried me to his
room and undressed me.

1530
01:46:29,258 --> 01:46:31,510
And he sang to comfort me.

1531
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,609
Is that when he promised
you the doll?

1532
01:46:46,609 --> 01:46:47,860
Yes.

1533
01:46:49,695 --> 01:46:50,696
No.

1534
01:46:51,864 --> 01:46:54,366
No, it was later, during the
night when I woke up and cried.

1535
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:57,328
- You slept in his bed?
- Yes.

1536
01:46:57,953 --> 01:46:59,955
Why were you crying
in the middle of the night?

1537
01:47:01,373 --> 01:47:02,374
| don't know.

1538
01:47:03,292 --> 01:47:04,710
Mama had been angry with me.

1539
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:08,005
- Isn't that why?
- Is it?

1540
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:11,050
Well, yes. That's surely why.

1541
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:13,218
You woke and cried. Why?

1542
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:16,931
I'd been asleep.

1543
01:47:16,931 --> 01:47:20,392
You woke up. You cried.
Why were you crying?

1544
01:47:23,771 --> 01:47:24,897
He'd locked the door.

1545
01:47:26,732 --> 01:47:28,400
Water was splashing
in the bathroom.

1546
01:47:40,329 --> 01:47:42,289
Father came towards me
in his red robe.

1547
01:47:43,332 --> 01:47:45,459
Tall, like a tower.

1548
01:47:47,044 --> 01:47:48,754
Strong as a god
when he embraced me.

1549
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:53,217
And he promised you
a doll if you wouldn't tell?

1550
01:47:53,217 --> 01:47:55,386
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1551
01:48:31,088 --> 01:48:32,172
| can walk.

1552
01:48:39,805 --> 01:48:40,806
| can walk.

1553
01:48:42,474 --> 01:48:43,559
You made me walk.

1554
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:55,612
My father was a criminal.

1555
01:48:57,698 --> 01:48:59,366
I'm sure he suffered
for what he did.

1556
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:01,660
I'm tired.

1557
01:49:03,078 --> 01:49:04,121
I'm so tired.

1558
01:49:20,888 --> 01:49:24,308
- Are you happy for me?
- I am, yes.

1559
01:49:26,310 --> 01:49:28,270
I'll go to sleep now
if you'll hold my hand.

1560
01:49:30,564 --> 01:49:31,565
| must go now.

1561
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:33,692
Of course.

1562
01:49:34,443 --> 01:49:36,320
| forget you have
other patients...

1563
01:49:37,529 --> 01:49:38,781
more important than me.

1564
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:42,576
Not more important.
| have other patients.

1565
01:49:45,204 --> 01:49:46,747
Please, don't let me keep you.

1566
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,373
I'll call this evening,
if you like.

1567
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,639
She walked.

1568
01:50:03,639 --> 01:50:05,432
The aggression was
remembered and she walked.

1569
01:50:06,433 --> 01:50:11,063
Yet something is wrong.
What about the doll?

1570
01:50:11,897 --> 01:50:13,774
It's the evidence of her
father's crime.

1571
01:50:14,525 --> 01:50:15,526
She should hate it,

1572
01:50:16,110 --> 01:50:17,736
yet she loves and cherishes it.

1573
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:20,489
Yes, something is wrong.

1574
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:26,870
Perhaps the answer lies still
further back, as in my own case.

1575
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:33,001
Mother.

1576
01:50:34,419 --> 01:50:36,171
When was I first on a train?

1577
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:40,384
When we left Freiberg
for Leipzig.

1578
01:50:41,176 --> 01:50:42,678
Did anything happen
on that trip?

1579
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,930
Nothing in particular.

1580
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:45,931
Nothing?

1581
01:50:46,849 --> 01:50:49,560
You were very young and
a train whistle frightened you.

1582
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:52,813
Yes.

1583
01:50:53,438 --> 01:50:55,524
We stopped overnight
in a hotel in Breslau,

1584
01:50:55,524 --> 01:50:56,608
to break the journey.

1585
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:59,153
At dawn, we boarded again.

1586
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:03,240
Every time the train whistle
blew, you cried with terror.

1587
01:51:05,284 --> 01:51:07,619
You said it was
an animal in pain. A big animal.

1588
01:51:08,287 --> 01:51:12,082
| must have heard that same
whistle on the way to Breslau,

1589
01:51:13,041 --> 01:51:14,293
and it didn't frighten me.

1590
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:15,836
No.

1591
01:51:16,879 --> 01:51:19,548
You only cried on the second
half of the journey.

1592
01:51:20,924 --> 01:51:23,218
Then it must've happened
in the compartment.

1593
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:26,180
What?

1594
01:51:28,515 --> 01:51:29,516
The trauma.

1595
01:51:31,018 --> 01:51:33,395
Whatever incident
it was I connected.

1596
01:51:33,395 --> 01:51:35,647
With the whistle
that frightened me so.

1597
01:51:38,233 --> 01:51:40,736
- But nothing happened.
- You're sure?

1598
01:51:42,654 --> 01:51:45,282
You're sure you never left us
alone the three of us

1599
01:51:45,282 --> 01:51:47,868
in the compartment?
Mitzi, father and me?

1600
01:51:47,868 --> 01:51:51,163
Mitzi?
Your sister wasn't born then.

1601
01:51:51,622 --> 01:51:53,707
- Wasn't born?
- Not for another six months.

1602
01:51:57,628 --> 01:51:58,629
Of course.

1603
01:52:00,839 --> 01:52:02,007
But of course.

1604
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:06,053
Yet there she is in my memory.

1605
01:52:07,179 --> 01:52:08,931
And not an infant,
a little girl.

1606
01:52:10,307 --> 01:52:12,184
You were only four years old.

1607
01:52:13,936 --> 01:52:15,812
Memory plays queer tricks.

1608
01:52:18,065 --> 01:52:19,691
And always to a purpose.

1609
01:52:23,028 --> 01:52:26,240
When we were in Breslau in the
hotel, where did I sleep?

1610
01:52:27,199 --> 01:52:28,200
In my bed.

1611
01:52:29,034 --> 01:52:31,161
To comfort you for your first
day away from home.

1612
01:52:32,246 --> 01:52:33,580
And father?

1613
01:52:34,706 --> 01:52:35,791
He was in the next room.

1614
01:52:37,167 --> 01:52:41,296
Even so he heard your crying,
got up and he came in.

1615
01:52:44,258 --> 01:52:45,467
Heard me crying...

1616
01:52:46,802 --> 01:52:50,097
that night... in the hotel.

1617
01:52:51,306 --> 01:52:52,516
Yes.

1618
01:52:55,185 --> 01:52:56,728
| gave you this to play with.

1619
01:52:57,271 --> 01:52:58,522
Yes, I remember.

1620
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:01,984
And what was it you called me?
My little...

1621
01:53:01,984 --> 01:53:03,193
- Arab.
- Arab.

1622
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:05,237
Because your hair was so black.

1623
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:09,116
Mother, may I have that?

1624
01:53:10,867 --> 01:53:11,868
Yes.

1625
01:53:13,412 --> 01:53:14,621
For a few days.

1626
01:53:30,762 --> 01:53:34,308
Doctor, I was just coming
to your house.

1627
01:53:34,308 --> 01:53:35,726
Where is Fraulein Koertner?

1628
01:53:37,102 --> 01:53:38,937
She's not at home?

1629
01:53:38,937 --> 01:53:41,189
She left a message that
you'd know where to find her.

1630
01:53:45,652 --> 01:53:47,195
How long has she been gone?

1631
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:49,364
Over an hour. Shall I drive you?

1632
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:52,743
No.

1633
01:54:00,459 --> 01:54:01,585
Where shall we go?

1634
01:54:02,419 --> 01:54:04,880
- Let's go to that hotel.
- Why?

1635
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:07,674
My father was a client there.
| know that place.

1636
01:54:09,634 --> 01:54:12,846
I've never made love.
You'll have to teach me.

1637
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:13,889
Come.

1638
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,184
But you can have me for nothing.

1639
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:20,354
You made me able to walk again.
You deserve a reward.

1640
01:54:21,396 --> 01:54:23,357
I've got nice smooth skin.

1641
01:54:23,357 --> 01:54:27,027
- Cecily, stop play acting!
- Why did you come after me?

1642
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:28,737
| came to take you home.

1643
01:54:28,737 --> 01:54:31,198
| belong with those women.
My blood is bad.

1644
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:32,324
I'm rotten to the core!

1645
01:54:33,825 --> 01:54:35,494
I'm my mother's daughter.

1646
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:37,829
| don't deserve
the father I had.

1647
01:54:38,372 --> 01:54:40,374
The most loving father
that ever lived.

1648
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:43,001
And |, his daughter...

1649
01:54:44,920 --> 01:54:47,839
accused him of such
an unnatural, unspeakable act!

1650
01:54:48,465 --> 01:54:50,509
Only a born harlot
could tell such a lie!

1651
01:54:52,511 --> 01:54:53,553
Cecily...

1652
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:55,806
look at me.

1653
01:54:57,140 --> 01:54:59,434
What you told me was a lie?

1654
01:54:59,893 --> 01:55:01,395
- Of course.
- Why did you lie?

1655
01:55:02,145 --> 01:55:04,064
Because you wanted me too.

1656
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,816
It pleased you.
| could see it in your eyes.

1657
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,361
He didn't touch me.

1658
01:55:10,946 --> 01:55:12,364
You must believe me.

1659
01:55:12,906 --> 01:55:13,907
You must!

1660
01:55:15,992 --> 01:55:18,120
- I'll kill myself?!
- Cecily!

1661
01:55:21,456 --> 01:55:22,457
Cecily!

1662
01:55:29,423 --> 01:55:30,590
Don't come near me!

1663
01:55:34,636 --> 01:55:35,804
You believe me?

1664
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:41,017
| believe you.

1665
01:55:44,813 --> 01:55:45,897
Give me a reason.

1666
01:55:47,107 --> 01:55:49,025
Give me one reason
why I shouldn't.

1667
01:55:49,818 --> 01:55:50,819
For my sake.

1668
01:55:51,486 --> 01:55:52,487
I'm the guilty one.

1669
01:55:54,072 --> 01:55:55,740
It was my lie, not yours.

1670
01:55:56,616 --> 01:55:59,953
If you destroy yourself,
that will be my doing too.

1671
01:57:04,809 --> 01:57:07,646
| gave you this
to play with.

1672
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:09,773
Yes, I remember.

1673
01:57:09,773 --> 01:57:12,275
What was it you called me?
My little...

1674
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:13,276
- Arab.
- Arab.

1675
01:57:14,236 --> 01:57:15,695
Because your hair
was so black.

1676
01:57:20,242 --> 01:57:21,493
Arab.

1677
01:57:57,904 --> 01:58:00,365
Hold him back, you weakling!

1678
01:58:00,782 --> 01:58:02,701
Honor me, your father!

1679
01:58:14,671 --> 01:58:15,880
The little Arab...

1680
01:58:15,880 --> 01:58:18,216
Sought my mother with his body

1681
01:58:18,216 --> 01:58:19,593
and called down
my father's wrath.

1682
01:58:20,802 --> 01:58:24,347
What hidden memory escaped
its prison in that dream?

1683
01:58:25,098 --> 01:58:27,642
It could only be of the night
in Breslau,

1684
01:58:27,642 --> 01:58:29,978
when mother gave me this
to quiet my sobs.

1685
01:58:31,271 --> 01:58:33,940
Why was [ crying?

1686
01:58:33,940 --> 01:58:36,318
The answer is cast
in this metal.

1687
01:58:37,819 --> 01:58:41,531
<i>| lay in a big bed,
watching my mother.</i>

1688
01:58:42,365 --> 01:58:46,411
<i>She was naked to the waist,
| remember.</i>

1689
01:59:17,651 --> 01:59:19,027
He took her away from me.

1690
01:59:20,236 --> 01:59:22,489
She was going to
lie down beside me.

1691
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:26,493
| would have cuddled
against her soft, warm body.

1692
01:59:27,494 --> 01:59:29,079
But he drew her into his room.

1693
01:59:30,747 --> 01:59:34,918
Souls burn in hell.
The hell of hatred, of jealousy.

1694
01:59:36,461 --> 01:59:37,629
| wished him dead.

1695
01:59:38,380 --> 01:59:40,465
To justify that guilty wish,

1696
01:59:40,465 --> 01:59:42,425
| conjured up
the crime against my sister.

1697
01:59:43,760 --> 01:59:47,889
| was jealous of my father. |
wanted my mother all to myself.

1698
01:59:48,682 --> 01:59:50,141
| wanted to be rid of him.

1699
01:59:51,351 --> 01:59:55,146
I'm the guilty one...
| dishonored my father.

1700
01:59:59,150 --> 02:00:00,151
| saw the light.

1701
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:03,071
It's so late.

1702
02:00:07,492 --> 02:00:09,536
Sigi, what is it?

1703
02:00:14,416 --> 02:00:16,751
Dear, I want to leave Vienna.

1704
02:00:17,419 --> 02:00:20,588
Go anywhere.
Be a doctor in a small town...

1705
02:00:21,047 --> 02:00:22,257
anywhere away from here.

1706
02:00:23,383 --> 02:00:24,551
But why, Sigi?

1707
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:28,012
My theory has offended everyone.

1708
02:00:29,013 --> 02:00:31,266
And no wonder. It's false.

1709
02:00:32,308 --> 02:00:35,103
And destructive. Cecily tried
to kill herself tonight.

1710
02:00:35,770 --> 02:00:37,021
Breuer warned me.

1711
02:00:37,856 --> 02:00:39,816
But you didn't mean any harm.
Why punish yourself?

1712
02:00:40,191 --> 02:00:41,651
| deserve to be punished.

1713
02:00:42,402 --> 02:00:44,863
| invented a theory
to dishonor my father.

1714
02:00:45,530 --> 02:00:48,575
| desecrated his image
in the fathers of my patients.

1715
02:00:50,118 --> 02:00:51,411
In the country...

1716
02:00:53,329 --> 02:00:55,832
we can be close again. I know.

1717
02:00:56,875 --> 02:00:59,419
| know you've hated
the work I've been doing.

1718
02:01:00,628 --> 02:01:02,213
It's created a wall between us.

1719
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:04,424
| can't deny that.

1720
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:09,012
When you're in your office
with a patient, a woman...

1721
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:12,891
| try not to think
what's happening.

1722
02:01:14,434 --> 02:01:17,562
The secrets you're hearing.
The obscenities.

1723
02:01:18,897 --> 02:01:20,565
| hate them and her and you!

1724
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:24,277
And I hate myself
for failing you.

1725
02:01:25,695 --> 02:01:28,573
I'm not a good wife.
I'm selfish and jealous.

1726
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,872
So, it should mean all the more
when I say you mustn't stop.

1727
02:01:38,666 --> 02:01:40,126
You mustn't stop, Sigi.

1728
02:01:55,809 --> 02:01:56,810
What are you doing?

1729
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:01,606
Your diary,
when you were a student.

1730
02:02:02,941 --> 02:02:03,983
Listen.

1731
02:02:05,819 --> 02:02:07,278
"Progress, like walking,”

1732
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:11,407
is achieved by losing
then regaining one's balance.

1733
02:02:12,617 --> 02:02:13,868
It's a series of mistakes...

1734
02:02:15,161 --> 02:02:16,162
Do you remember?

1735
02:02:16,871 --> 02:02:17,914
Yes.

1736
02:02:19,374 --> 02:02:20,375
Do you remember the end?

1737
02:02:21,835 --> 02:02:25,505
"From error to error,
one discovers the entire truth".

1738
02:02:28,091 --> 02:02:30,468
| used to say to myself,

1739
02:02:30,468 --> 02:02:33,763
the false is often the truth
standing on its head.

1740
02:02:46,317 --> 02:02:47,610
Reversal.

1741
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:48,653
Yes!

1742
02:02:50,113 --> 02:02:55,535
Yes, she claimed
that her father had seduced her.

1743
02:02:55,535 --> 02:02:56,536
False.

1744
02:02:57,495 --> 02:02:59,622
It wasn't he who
desired his daughter,

1745
02:03:00,164 --> 02:03:01,708
it was she who wanted him.

1746
02:03:03,334 --> 02:03:05,545
And it was not a memory
that she had repressed.

1747
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:07,255
No!

1748
02:03:09,382 --> 02:03:10,425
It was a fantasy.

1749
02:03:11,926 --> 02:03:12,927
Yes.

1750
02:03:13,845 --> 02:03:15,305
They'd shared the same bed.

1751
02:03:15,889 --> 02:03:19,642
The next morning, she had her
doll, her child by him.

1752
02:03:20,977 --> 02:03:23,229
Was she lying to me? No.
To herself?

1753
02:03:24,606 --> 02:03:25,690
No.

1754
02:03:26,608 --> 02:03:28,568
The unconscious is pitch dark.

1755
02:03:29,485 --> 02:03:32,447
| told myself, in my darkness,

1756
02:03:32,447 --> 02:03:34,324
that father had torn
my mother away from me

1757
02:03:35,909 --> 02:03:38,161
because I couldn't bear her
deserting me for him.

1758
02:03:41,789 --> 02:03:44,334
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

1759
02:03:44,334 --> 02:03:45,501
It fits.

1760
02:03:46,169 --> 02:03:49,339
Cecily loved her father.
| loved my mother.

1761
02:03:50,381 --> 02:03:52,675
She hated her mother.
| hated my father.

1762
02:03:55,553 --> 02:03:57,931
The truth has emerged,
upside down.

1763
02:03:58,806 --> 02:04:00,892
And it will walk on
one premise alone.

1764
02:04:01,684 --> 02:04:04,270
There must be sexuality
in childhood.

1765
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:05,980
Even in infancy.

1766
02:04:09,275 --> 02:04:11,486
Tell it not in Gath, my love,

1767
02:04:11,486 --> 02:04:14,989
and above all, hide the good
news from the Philistines.

1768
02:04:30,964 --> 02:04:33,841
Forgive me.
| haven't cried in a long time.

1769
02:04:35,927 --> 02:04:36,928
She...

1770
02:04:38,221 --> 02:04:40,515
She talked in her sleep
last night...

1771
02:04:42,225 --> 02:04:43,851
as she did when she was little.

1772
02:04:45,812 --> 02:04:49,440
She used to wake up screaming
and say she had dreamed

1773
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:50,608
that I was dead.

1774
02:04:52,151 --> 02:04:56,614
There was a time when I wished
that she was dead.

1775
02:04:56,614 --> 02:04:57,615
When was that?

1776
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:00,118
When I carried her in my womb.

1777
02:05:01,869 --> 02:05:03,162
Before I was married,

1778
02:05:05,540 --> 02:05:08,001
| was a dancer
in a cheap cabaret.

1779
02:05:09,877 --> 02:05:12,046
One night after
I'd done my turn...

1780
02:05:13,381 --> 02:05:15,133
| went back to my dressing room

1781
02:05:15,967 --> 02:05:17,301
and there was
a man sitting there.

1782
02:05:19,595 --> 02:05:22,265
A handsome swell...

1783
02:05:25,393 --> 02:05:27,478
with a flower in his buttonhole.

1784
02:05:30,690 --> 02:05:32,358
Six weeks later we were married.

1785
02:05:34,610 --> 02:05:37,030
We creatures, as everyone knows,

1786
02:05:38,573 --> 02:05:40,324
long for respectability.

1787
02:05:41,576 --> 02:05:43,786
| wanted only
to forget the past.

1788
02:05:45,079 --> 02:05:46,706
To be a good wife and mother.

1789
02:05:47,665 --> 02:05:50,293
| was pregnant before
the honeymoon was over,

1790
02:05:50,293 --> 02:05:53,963
but I waited to tell Joseph
till our first night home.

1791
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:57,175
I'll never forget
the look of his face.

1792
02:06:00,845 --> 02:06:04,182
Without a word,
he arose and left the house.

1793
02:06:06,142 --> 02:06:07,727
He never touched me again.

1794
02:06:09,645 --> 02:06:14,650
He married me only
to have a harlot in the house.

1795
02:06:25,912 --> 02:06:29,916
Well, doctor,
who is the guilty one?

1796
02:06:30,875 --> 02:06:32,460
Must there be a guilty one?

1797
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:34,629
Not even he?

1798
02:06:35,129 --> 02:06:36,172
No.

1799
02:06:37,048 --> 02:06:39,759
His desire for prostitutes
was a neurotic symptom.

1800
02:06:41,302 --> 02:06:42,303
But what caused it?

1801
02:06:43,554 --> 02:06:45,014
He's dead. We shall never know.

1802
02:06:46,849 --> 02:06:50,311
Do you remember, as a child,
dreaming of your mother's death?

1803
02:06:50,311 --> 02:06:52,730
Why do you think
you dreamt such dreams?

1804
02:06:53,564 --> 02:06:56,943
Was it to fulfill a wish
you couldn't consciously admit?

1805
02:07:00,571 --> 02:07:02,240
So I was a monster even then?

1806
02:07:03,074 --> 02:07:05,701
Whatever stands between
desire and fulfilment

1807
02:07:06,244 --> 02:07:07,745
that the child wishes away.

1808
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:11,332
Your mother stood between
you and your lover.

1809
02:07:12,625 --> 02:07:15,545
My lover? I was four years old.

1810
02:07:15,545 --> 02:07:18,673
You loved your father.
Your mother kept him from you.

1811
02:07:18,673 --> 02:07:21,551
- You wanted her out of the way.
- She snatched me away from him.

1812
02:07:22,135 --> 02:07:23,719
Carried me to my bed
and left me alone

1813
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:25,429
so she could go back to him.

1814
02:07:25,429 --> 02:07:29,100
- Put her down!
- Papa! Papa!

1815
02:07:29,100 --> 02:07:33,437
Papa! Papal!

1816
02:07:33,437 --> 02:07:35,231
She was keeping him from me.

1817
02:07:35,731 --> 02:07:37,608
| wished she was dead.
| wanted to kill her.

1818
02:07:40,820 --> 02:07:41,821
Why?

1819
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:45,199
Why do I hate her so now...

1820
02:07:46,367 --> 02:07:48,578
as if it had happened
yesterday, not those years ago?

1821
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:52,790
Time does not exist
in the unconscious.

1822
02:07:54,458 --> 02:07:56,127
Shall I tell you your story?

1823
02:07:59,088 --> 02:08:01,841
Like every child, you
needed your mother's caresses,

1824
02:08:02,300 --> 02:08:03,676
the warmth of her body.

1825
02:08:04,343 --> 02:08:05,386
You were denied them.

1826
02:08:06,179 --> 02:08:09,891
So you turned to your father
who did caress you.

1827
02:08:10,474 --> 02:08:12,393
You came to depend
on those caresses.

1828
02:08:13,060 --> 02:08:15,938
You threw yourself
info whatever role

1829
02:08:15,938 --> 02:08:17,398
you thought
would give him pleasure.

1830
02:08:17,982 --> 02:08:20,651
You played the dancer,
the mistress of the house,

1831
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:22,653
you even played
your father's wife.

1832
02:08:24,071 --> 02:08:26,532
Then your mother interfered.

1833
02:08:26,532 --> 02:08:27,533
You wished her dead.

1834
02:08:28,576 --> 02:08:31,078
Desire for your father,
the death wish for your mother.

1835
02:08:31,746 --> 02:08:35,166
In time you learned this
two-fold urge was forbidden.

1836
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:37,376
It had to be repressed.

1837
02:08:38,169 --> 02:08:39,921
Thereafter,
whatever happened to you,

1838
02:08:39,921 --> 02:08:41,756
whatever misfortunes,
fanned its fires.

1839
02:08:43,174 --> 02:08:45,676
Cecily, no you are not guilty.

1840
02:08:46,427 --> 02:08:49,305
Or, if you're, your guilt is
shared by every human being.

1841
02:08:50,514 --> 02:08:52,767
The innocent
is born into a world

1842
02:08:52,767 --> 02:08:55,061
in which it cannot help
but lose its innocence.

1843
02:08:56,395 --> 02:08:58,773
Every child is foredoomed
to become a sinner.

1844
02:08:59,482 --> 02:09:02,777
| sinned too.
| dreamed of killing my father.

1845
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,781
Then you were a monster too.

1846
02:09:06,781 --> 02:09:09,283
No, I was a child.

1847
02:09:13,287 --> 02:09:14,956
| accept everything
you say to me,

1848
02:09:16,749 --> 02:09:19,585
but you told me that knowing
the cause of my illness

1849
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:20,586
would cure me,

1850
02:09:21,045 --> 02:09:22,421
and I still wish I were dead.

1851
02:09:26,634 --> 02:09:30,721
And now I'm cured,
you'll never see me again.

1852
02:09:31,889 --> 02:09:35,226
| will see you again,
because you're not cured.

1853
02:09:35,977 --> 02:09:37,395
My symptoms are gone.

1854
02:09:38,145 --> 02:09:40,064
Yes. All but one.

1855
02:09:41,983 --> 02:09:44,694
- Which?
- Your love for me.

1856
02:09:48,030 --> 02:09:49,490
That isn't a symptom.

1857
02:09:50,950 --> 02:09:54,287
Why do you suppose you went
to Red Tower Street last night?

1858
02:09:56,998 --> 02:09:59,333
To punish myself
for a lie I told.

1859
02:09:59,333 --> 02:10:00,459
No.

1860
02:10:01,168 --> 02:10:04,338
You were pursuing your father.
Pursuing him through me.

1861
02:10:04,338 --> 02:10:06,507
You were still seeking
his caresses

1862
02:10:07,550 --> 02:10:10,177
by catering to his desire
for prostitutes.

1863
02:10:11,345 --> 02:10:14,515
Pursuing him through you?

1864
02:10:14,515 --> 02:10:16,934
I'm only a reflection
of his image.

1865
02:10:17,727 --> 02:10:19,520
But I love you for yourself!

1866
02:10:21,522 --> 02:10:23,566
Did you love Dr. Breuer
for himself?

1867
02:10:25,109 --> 02:10:27,778
| just thought
| loved Dr. Breuer.

1868
02:10:27,778 --> 02:10:30,781
| was wrong!
And there's no connection.

1869
02:10:30,781 --> 02:10:33,451
Yes, there is.
You told me so yourself.

1870
02:10:34,785 --> 02:10:36,078
Describe the tower again.

1871
02:10:39,123 --> 02:10:40,124
It was...

1872
02:10:40,791 --> 02:10:44,503
round and red... Tall.

1873
02:10:45,212 --> 02:10:47,340
And there was
a coat of arms over the door.

1874
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:51,010
Yes. A staff with a snake.

1875
02:10:52,678 --> 02:10:54,263
Isn't that the doctors' emblem?

1876
02:10:54,263 --> 02:10:55,514
There was also an inscription.

1877
02:10:56,223 --> 02:10:58,976
Can you remember it now? Try.

1878
02:11:02,313 --> 02:11:03,439
Uh...

1879
02:11:04,690 --> 02:11:07,193
"Royal Ministry of
Communications".

1880
02:11:09,111 --> 02:11:10,363
Communications.

1881
02:11:11,697 --> 02:11:12,698
Communicating.

1882
02:11:13,616 --> 02:11:14,700
Tell you my secrets.

1883
02:11:15,743 --> 02:11:16,827
Am I right?

1884
02:11:17,370 --> 02:11:18,412
Yes.

1885
02:11:19,747 --> 02:11:22,041
This makes your dream
an allegory.

1886
02:11:22,875 --> 02:11:24,627
Through love, it says,

1887
02:11:24,627 --> 02:11:26,837
you'll be able to
reveal your secrets

1888
02:11:26,837 --> 02:11:28,589
to the doctor whose
emblem is above.

1889
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:33,219
When they're told and
understood, you'll be cured.

1890
02:11:34,428 --> 02:11:35,513
Then you...

1891
02:11:36,722 --> 02:11:37,765
accept this love?

1892
02:11:38,766 --> 02:11:40,059
As a sacred trust,

1893
02:11:41,268 --> 02:11:44,605
until it disappears to make
room for another love.

1894
02:11:44,605 --> 02:11:46,649
A love of your own choice.

1895
02:11:49,026 --> 02:11:50,820
Our work
is only beginning, Cecily.

1896
02:11:51,487 --> 02:11:54,156
It will take time to put your
past in order.

1897
02:11:54,156 --> 02:11:55,157
There'll be relapses,

1898
02:11:56,242 --> 02:12:00,746
but the day will come when you
will face life on its terms.

1899
02:12:02,164 --> 02:12:03,207
Believe me.

1900
02:12:06,001 --> 02:12:07,002
| do.

1901
02:12:09,130 --> 02:12:13,008
| shall expect you in my office,
tomorrow, five o'clock.

1902
02:12:19,557 --> 02:12:23,060
Would you please tell Mama
I'd like to see her?

1903
02:12:25,312 --> 02:12:26,981
| marvel at the ease

1904
02:12:26,981 --> 02:12:29,150
with which you suit things
to your own convenience.

1905
02:12:29,817 --> 02:12:33,821
Yesterday you condemned parents.
Today, the children are guilty.

1906
02:12:35,364 --> 02:12:38,325
There is no guilt
in sexuality at its source.

1907
02:12:38,325 --> 02:12:40,578
Only after the river
has passed through cities.

1908
02:12:41,912 --> 02:12:44,582
| disapprove of your new theory.
It repels me.

1909
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:47,835
Do you think I'm going to risk
my reputation

1910
02:12:47,835 --> 02:12:50,045
as a man and physician,

1911
02:12:50,045 --> 02:12:51,672
simply to have my name
on another book?

1912
02:12:52,673 --> 02:12:55,009
We could sign our contributions
separately, if you like.

1913
02:12:55,009 --> 02:12:57,511
No! I will not be connected
with it in any way!

1914
02:13:01,932 --> 02:13:05,144
Well, then,
let's leave the chapter out.

1915
02:13:06,937 --> 02:13:08,314
Thank heaven.

1916
02:13:08,314 --> 02:13:09,315
In that case,

1917
02:13:10,191 --> 02:13:13,486
| shall read it as a paper
at the next Medical Congress.

1918
02:13:13,944 --> 02:13:15,905
And end your career
in one night.

1919
02:13:16,697 --> 02:13:17,698
Freud.

1920
02:13:18,574 --> 02:13:19,658
Sigmund.

1921
02:13:21,285 --> 02:13:23,120
Your father asked me
to look after you.

1922
02:13:23,662 --> 02:13:25,331
Take his place in your life.

1923
02:13:26,165 --> 02:13:29,168
You've accepted me.
I've loved you as a son.

1924
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:33,130
Yes, and I've loved you.

1925
02:13:34,173 --> 02:13:38,886
As your spiritual father,
| forbid you to read this paper.

1926
02:13:46,727 --> 02:13:50,231
The time comes when one
must give up all one's fathers

1927
02:13:51,440 --> 02:13:52,441
and stand alone.

1928
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:04,411
Gentlemen!

1929
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:07,081
"The age of innocence"
it is called,

1930
02:14:07,081 --> 02:14:09,833
because the child
is not supposed to have

1931
02:14:09,833 --> 02:14:11,085
any sexual awareness.

1932
02:14:11,919 --> 02:14:13,712
This mistaken belief

1933
02:14:13,712 --> 02:14:16,590
reflects society's
own feelings of fear and guilt.

1934
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:21,554
In infancy, he is a veracious
young animal

1935
02:14:21,554 --> 02:14:23,514
intent on filling his stomach.

1936
02:14:24,014 --> 02:14:27,518
Warm milk flows into his mouth.
It gives him pleasure.

1937
02:14:28,185 --> 02:14:29,603
Pleasure he seeks to extend

1938
02:14:29,603 --> 02:14:31,689
even when his hunger
is satisfied.

1939
02:14:31,689 --> 02:14:34,650
So he sucks on a false nipple
or his thumb.

1940
02:14:36,026 --> 02:14:40,698
The gratification sensitizes
the region of his mouth and lips

1941
02:14:40,698 --> 02:14:42,825
so that it becomes
an erogenous zone.

1942
02:14:45,411 --> 02:14:48,163
Which, in adult life...

1943
02:14:49,540 --> 02:14:52,835
Which in adult life,
finds pleasure in the kiss.

1944
02:14:54,753 --> 02:14:56,422
The infant is bathed.

1945
02:14:56,422 --> 02:14:58,424
He is fondled and caressed
by the mother.

1946
02:14:58,841 --> 02:15:01,468
His whole body responds
to her loving care.

1947
02:15:02,386 --> 02:15:04,221
His desire for her breast

1948
02:15:04,221 --> 02:15:08,559
gradually extends to a desire
for the mother herself.

1949
02:15:29,288 --> 02:15:33,667
Inevitably, she becomes the
first love object of the child.

1950
02:15:33,667 --> 02:15:37,880
Then he discovers
that she is not alone.

1951
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:40,549
He has a rival, his father.

1952
02:15:42,301 --> 02:15:45,763
So, before he can understand
or contend with it,

1953
02:15:45,763 --> 02:15:48,015
he is consumed with jealousy.

1954
02:15:48,015 --> 02:15:51,393
Trapped in a conflict
between love and hate.

1955
02:15:54,605 --> 02:15:57,191
There is little new in this.
The ancient Greeks

1956
02:15:57,191 --> 02:15:59,401
revealed their knowledge
of these truths

1957
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:00,986
in the story of Oedipus,

1958
02:16:00,986 --> 02:16:03,906
who, all unknowing,
killed his father

1959
02:16:03,906 --> 02:16:05,658
and took his mother to wife.

1960
02:16:09,161 --> 02:16:10,162
And...

1961
02:16:11,455 --> 02:16:14,708
And thereafter, was condemned
to wander through life,

1962
02:16:14,708 --> 02:16:16,043
blind and homeless.

1963
02:16:16,710 --> 02:16:20,214
The shadow of this doom
lies over us all.

1964
02:16:24,259 --> 02:16:28,138
Gentlemen! We are not
in a political meeting.

1965
02:16:28,138 --> 02:16:30,474
Dr. Freud must be
allowed to speak!

1966
02:16:31,308 --> 02:16:33,143
It is in the Oedipus Complex.

1967
02:16:33,143 --> 02:16:36,271
The child's fixation on the
parent of the opposite sex

1968
02:16:36,271 --> 02:16:38,899
that infantile eroticism
reaches its climax.

1969
02:16:40,901 --> 02:16:42,486
Each...

1970
02:16:42,486 --> 02:16:45,531
Each human being
is confronted with the task

1971
02:16:45,531 --> 02:16:48,075
of overcoming this complex
within himself.

1972
02:16:48,992 --> 02:16:52,913
If he succeeds,
he will be a whole individual.

1973
02:16:52,913 --> 02:16:56,291
If he fails,
he will become a neurotic,

1974
02:16:56,291 --> 02:17:01,463
and himself wander forever,
blind and homeless.

1975
02:17:01,505 --> 02:17:02,923
Sit down!

1976
02:17:06,009 --> 02:17:10,514
Gentlemen, I am deeply grateful
for your kind attention.

1977
02:17:11,598 --> 02:17:15,352
You have not ceased
to display the detachment,

1978
02:17:16,061 --> 02:17:18,439
the love of truth
for truth's sake...

1979
02:17:18,439 --> 02:17:19,565
What truth?

1980
02:17:19,565 --> 02:17:21,191
That ennobles our profession.

1981
02:17:25,195 --> 02:17:28,782
Gentlemen, have
you any questions?

1982
02:17:28,782 --> 02:17:30,743
Just one question.

1983
02:17:31,535 --> 02:17:33,287
And I shall not ask it
of the speaker.

1984
02:17:35,706 --> 02:17:40,419
Dr. Breuer, you are aware of the
esteem in which we all hold you.

1985
02:17:42,004 --> 02:17:44,006
Do you share
your collaborator's views?

1986
02:17:48,343 --> 02:17:51,638
Sir, my collaborator
is an eminent man.

1987
02:17:53,182 --> 02:17:54,641
He is a zealous worker,

1988
02:17:55,893 --> 02:17:59,396
and there are many here
who would do well to have

1989
02:17:59,396 --> 02:18:01,899
his scruples
and professional conscience.

1990
02:18:06,570 --> 02:18:08,071
How dare you?

1991
02:18:09,114 --> 02:18:12,576
And how dare you ask me for
references regarding Dr. Freud?

1992
02:18:13,786 --> 02:18:17,039
Who in this hall can say,
"I am worth more than that man"?

1993
02:18:17,623 --> 02:18:19,583
No one is dreaming
of that, Dr. Breuer.

1994
02:18:20,167 --> 02:18:22,002
| would simply like to know

1995
02:18:22,002 --> 02:18:23,462
whether you share
the speaker's views.

1996
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:30,969
To be specific, what do you
think of infantile sexuality?

1997
02:18:44,024 --> 02:18:45,359
| do not believe in it.

1998
02:18:46,568 --> 02:18:48,320
| have never believed in it.

1999
02:18:49,196 --> 02:18:52,199
| can never accept it.
Never accept it, never!

2000
02:19:07,047 --> 02:19:09,675
Gentlemen,
the meeting is adjourned!

2001
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:44,960
"Know thyself."

2002
02:19:47,087 --> 02:19:48,881
Two thousand years ago,

2003
02:19:48,881 --> 02:19:51,800
these words were carved
on the temple at Delphi.

2004
02:19:52,593 --> 02:19:53,760
"Know thyself."

2005
02:19:55,429 --> 02:19:57,681
They're the beginning of wisdom.

2006
02:19:59,182 --> 02:20:02,477
In them,
lies the single hope of victory

2007
02:20:02,936 --> 02:20:06,356
over man's oldest enemy:
His vanity.

2008
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:12,070
This knowledge is how
within our grasp.

2009
02:20:14,031 --> 02:20:15,240
Will we use it?

2010
02:20:17,242 --> 02:20:18,368
Let us hope.
