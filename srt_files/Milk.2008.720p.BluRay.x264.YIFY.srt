<i>HARVEY:This is
Harvey Milk speaking
on Friday, November 18th.</i>

2
00:02:40,673 --> 00:02:45,133
This is only to be played
in the event of my death
by assassination.

3
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:51,315
During one of
my early campaigns,

4
00:02:51,384 --> 00:02:57,289
I began to open speeches with
a line and it became kind of
a signature.

5
00:02:57,957 --> 00:03:01,120
<i>My name is Harvey Milk
and I want to recruit you.</i>

(ALL CHEERING)

7
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:07,423
If I was speaking to a
slightly hostile audience

8
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,561
or a mostly straight one,
I might break the tension
with a joke.

9
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:14,471
I know. I know I'm
not what you expected,

10
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,132
but I left my
high heels at home.

11
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:17,471
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

12
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:25,049
I fully realize that a person
who stands for what I stand
for,

13
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:26,584
an activist,
a gay activist,

14

<i>terrified, afraid
and disturbed themselves.</i>

16
00:03:35,728 --> 00:03:40,256
It's a very real
possibility you see,
because in San Francisco,

17
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,133
we have broken a dam
of major prejudice
in this country.

it's my duty to
make this announcement.

I wish
I had time to explain
all the things that I did.

26
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:15,700
Almost everything was done
with an eye on the gay
movement.

No, hey, actually
it is my birthday.
At midnight.

33
00:04:39,592 --> 00:04:40,650
Really?

34
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:44,190
And, believe it or not,
I don't have any plans.

35
00:04:45,665 --> 00:04:48,133
Some people took
me out after work.

36
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:53,797
Hmm. And that would
be at, let me guess,
Ma Bell or AT&T.

to diaper rash.

42
00:05:05,518 --> 00:05:07,076
You left out bad breath.

Just kidding.

44
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,787
You're not gonna let me
spend my birthday all
by myself, are you?

45
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:21,865
Listen, Harvey,

46
00:05:23,169 --> 00:05:25,160
you're pretty cute,

47
00:05:25,237 --> 00:05:27,205

Well, then, this
is my lucky night.

SCOTT: Jackson, Mississippi.

You can't respond to just

Hmm, now you tell me.

64
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:55,421
The New York Police

They're arrogant
and they're everywhere.

to be very careful,

(CHUCKLES) Are you on
some uppers or something?

69

No. This is
just plain me.

70
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,569
And you're scared
of the cops?

71
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,901
I'm just discreet.
I know a lot of people.

72

I could lose my job.

Oh, you're one of those.

00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:23,447
Well, I think you need
to find a new scene.
Some new friends.

I need a change.
I know.

76

Yeah, you're 40 now.

Oh.

00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,265
Forty years old
and I haven't done
a thing I'm proud of.

79

You keep eating this cake
and you're going to be
fat by the time you're 50.

get to 50. Oh!

Just a little shop
with a little overhead.

you know, I would like

119
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:33,377
to join the, what's it called,
The Eureka Valley Merchants
Association.

120

I'm not an interloper.

hope you'll forgive that.

those doors,

your license.

You know,
we pay taxes.

We'll get the addresses of
every customer that comes in

them what they want,
what they need changed.

One more minute.

00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:00,094
And I can go to
the neighborhood banks.

144
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:02,065
They must have
some gay customers.

I'm a businessman, Scott.

148
00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:13,808

good to their customers.

Even if their
customers are gay.

00:12:16,749 --> 00:12:18,740
For God's sake,
it's San Francisco!

151
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:21,650
SCOTT: Yeah.
Well, it's just like any
other city in the country.

152
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,244
They hate us.
Real surprise.

153
00:12:23,322 --> 00:12:26,155
We should have
at least one block
in one city, right?

154
00:12:26,225 --> 00:12:29,956
We start there and then
we'll take over the
neighborhood.

155
00:12:30,028 --> 00:12:31,359
Maybe.

156
00:12:32,664 --> 00:12:33,892
I'm coming in.

157
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:36,161

on the Psychiatric Center

pushing into my district?

to study it...

piece on my platform.
Getting it out of my district.

rapists, that sort of thing,

like to live that life.

01:54:16,929 --> 01:54:21,059
Now, look,
take some time off.
Spend it with your family.

HARVEY: Tell President Carter
we're coming after him next,
this time next year.

1804
01:55:11,717 --> 01:55:12,809
Hi, Dianne.

1805
01:55:12,885 --> 01:55:15,080
HARVEY:
We're marching
to Washington D.C.

1806
01:55:18,024 --> 01:55:20,288
Hey, can I see you in
my office for a minute?

1807
01:55:22,662 --> 01:55:26,120
Sure. I'll be back.
Yeah.

1809
01:55:44,617 --> 01:55:45,845
No.

1810
01:56:27,693 --> 01:56:29,854
Well,
you know what I think?

1811
01:56:29,929 --> 01:56:32,659
I think you need
to find a new scene.

1812
01:56:32,732 --> 01:56:34,324
And some new friends.

1813
01:56:36,969 --> 01:56:38,800
I need a change.

1814
01:56:42,174 --> 01:56:44,267
You're 40 now.
Oh.

1815
01:56:49,148 --> 01:56:54,245
Forty years old
and I haven't done
a thing I'm proud of.

1816
01:56:56,122 --> 01:57:00,718
Keep eating all that cake,
you're gonna be a fat-ass
by the time you're 50.

1817
01:57:00,793 --> 01:57:03,762
No,
I'll never
make it to 50.

1818
01:57:49,275 --> 01:57:50,867
Where is everyone?

1819
01:57:51,877 --> 01:57:53,606
Doesn't anyone
give a damn?

Cleve's getting some people
together in the Castro.

Last week I got a phone call
from Altoona, Pennsylvania.

1822
01:58:10,496 --> 01:58:16,332
The voice was very young,
and the person said, "Thanks.' '

1823
01:58:17,670 --> 01:58:22,403
<i>You've got to elect gay people
so that the young child</i>

1824
01:58:23,008 --> 01:58:26,136
<i>and the thousands upon
thousands just like him</i>

1825
01:58:27,046 --> 01:58:29,708
<i>will have hope
for a better life.</i>

1826
01:58:30,850 --> 01:58:33,250
<i>Hope for a better tomorrow.</i>

1827
01:58:50,736 --> 01:58:52,203
<i>I ask this,</i>

1828
01:58:53,739 --> 01:58:56,674
<i>that if there be
an assassination,</i>

1829
01:58:58,310 --> 01:59:04,510
<i>I would want five, ten,
a hundred, a thousand to rise.</i>

<i>If a bullet should enter
my brain, let it destroy
every closet door.</i>

1831
01:59:15,127 --> 01:59:22,329
<i>I ask for the movement
to continue because it's
not about personal gain,</i>

1832
01:59:22,401 --> 01:59:25,564
<i>and it's not about ego
and it's not about power.</i>

1833
01:59:26,338 --> 01:59:28,863
<i>It's about the
"us's" out there.</i>

1834
01:59:30,242 --> 01:59:34,008
<i>Not just the gays but
the blacks and the Asians</i>

1835
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:35,979
<i>and the seniors
and the disabled.</i>

1836

<i>The "us's."</i>

1837
01:59:40,953 --> 01:59:44,320
<i>Without hope,
the "us's" give up.</i>

1838
01:59:46,525 --> 01:59:50,621
<i>And I know you can't
live on hope alone.</i>

1839
01:59:50,696 --> 01:59:55,395
<i>But without hope,
life is not worth living.</i>

1840
01:59:57,770 --> 01:59:59,169
<i>So you,</i>

1841
02:00:00,139 --> 02:00:01,697
<i>and you,</i>

1842
02:00:02,208 --> 02:00:03,573
<i>and you,</i>

1843
02:00:03,943 --> 02:00:05,968
you got to give them hope.

1844
02:00:07,813 --> 02:00:10,304
You got to give them hope.
