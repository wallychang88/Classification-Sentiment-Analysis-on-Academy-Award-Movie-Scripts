1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:00,040
25.000

2
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,560
<i>(in German) Good. Huh? Huh?
What does he say?</i>

3
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,360
The English are running away, sir.

4
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,880
Aha! Throw in the German tanks.
Attack. Quickly.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,120
Use the ninth tank division. Immediately!

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,120
Well? A complete rout, excellency.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,680
- We're pushing them here and here.
- I know. What else?

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,200
Only Tobruk is still holding out.
There is a unit of considerable size there.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,520
Well, Tobruk. We'll have it
in a few days. What else?

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,400
We should regroup now.
To Alexandria, over Alamein, or to Cairo.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,800
Alexandria, Cairo. Nonsense. Suez.
We're pushing through to Suez. Suez.

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,800
<i>(narrator) Suez:  the key to the Middle East.</i>

13
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,960
<i>And with the British in full retreat,</i>

14
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,480
<i>nothing stood in Rommel's way
but the tiny garrison of Empire troops</i>

15
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,040
<i>cut off in the fortress town of Tobruk.</i>

16
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,000
<i>This is the story of Tobruk
and the men who made up its garrison,</i>

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,440
<i>of the fight they made against
the pick of Hitler's troops</i>

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,880
<i>and of the nickname they won with blood
and bore with pride: "The Desert Rats. "</i>

19
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,240
<i>and of the nickname they won with blood
and bore with pride: "The Desert Rats. "</i>

20
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,400
(explosion)

21
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,480
- Message, sir, from the Corps signal officer.
- Thanks. Barney, glad you got here.

22
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,240
The General's waiting for you.

23
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,240
Orders came in from Cairo.
The General's laying it out now.

24
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,440
I want these minefields re-laid
immediately by your sappers.

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,080
Exactly the same as the Italians, sir?

26
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,880
They had nine months
to determine the best locations.

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,080
We may have nine hours
before Rommel attacks.

28
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
(explosion)

29
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,800
- Or less, if that artillery is any indication.
- Yes, sir.

30
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,720
- Message for you, sir.
- Thank you.

31
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,480
It's good to see you, Barney.
I need your help.

32
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,600
Cairo's said to take up defensive
positions and hold for two months.

33
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,400
Two months? Can we?

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,000
If we stop Rommel tomorrow,
I'll tell you better.

35
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
And now if I may have
your attention, gentlemen,

36
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,560
in order there may be no misunderstandings,

37
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,840
these are our present defense positions.

38
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,680
Our first line of defense:

39
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,240
using much of the old Italian perimeter,

40
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,120
our second line:
Colonel White's supporting artillery

41
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,320
and our inner fortifications.

42
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,440
Now, Rommel is preparing to attack.

43
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,040
The most logical place to strike is here.

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,360
He sends his tanks in,
pushes up this corridor,

45
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:36,160
and with his infantry, fans out
and creates havoc with our inner defenses.

46
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:43,200
Thus, our plan of defense is based chiefly
on the belief that Rommel will attack here.

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,040
You gentlemen will have the honor

48
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,200
of being the first to expose
the blitzkrieg for what it is:

49
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,960
a highly limited tactical maneuver.

50
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,960
I propose to let Rommel's tanks
come through here unopposed.

51
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:59,880
You infantry commanders
will engage and stop

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
all German infantry here at the perimeter,

53
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,800
leaving the tanks to proceed
up this avenue alone.

54
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,720
Colonel White will have moved
as much artillery as he can spare

55
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,240
to line both sides of this avenue.

56
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,280
Across here, we are already
digging positions

57
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,200
for the captured Italian field pieces.

58
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,000
So, the longer we hold our fire,

59
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,520
the deeper Rommel's tanks
will advance into this box

60
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,360
and the easier they will be to destroy.

61
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,840
Am I right, Barney?

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,200
I most certainly hope so, sir.

63
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,600
(all chuckle)

64
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,400
That'll be all. Thank you, gentlemen.

65
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,160
Tea?

66
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,840
No, thank you, sir.

67
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,040
Well?

68
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,360
Cairo wants to hold on for two months.

69
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,160
If those tanks get in among our inner
defenses, we shan't even be able to evacuate.

70
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,280
It'll be a wholesale slaughter, sir.

71
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,000
- Interesting, isn't it?
- Yes, fascinating.

72
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,040
How many men do we have
in the officers' pool?

73
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Too many. Four more came in today from
that battalion wiped out on the Derna Road.

74
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,720
I need an infantry captain
with battle experience.

75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Mm-hmm. I have one.

76
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,640
Been out here a year. Twice decorated.

77
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,800
Name of MacRoberts.

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,680
The reserve company I asked for a week ago
has just come in.

79
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
They're at the docks now.

80
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,960
Green or not, I've got to put them
into the line.

81
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,720
- What?
- I've got to do it.

82
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,240
Detail this MacRoberts to them as an adviser.
That's the best I can do for them.

83
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,880
Very good, sir.
I'll get him down there right away.

84
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,840
(snoring)

85
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,040
- Captain. Captain.
- What's up? What is it?

86
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
- Captain MacRoberts, sir?
- Yeah. What is it?

87
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,840
- Orders from headquarters. Colonel White.
- What are they?

88
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,080
Temporary duty with an Australian company.
They're at the dock.

89
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,200
Australian company?
What do they want me to...

90
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,680
Oh, never mind. Find my sergeant, will you?

91
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,760
Donaldson. He's in there, I expect.
And leave me your torch.

92
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,000
(laughter)

93
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,880
Get out of the way!

94
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,280
These your men, Lieutenant?

95
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,400
- Why, uh, yes, sir.
- Then get 'em under control.

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,960
All right, you men! Break it up!

97
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,160
Form up here! Fall in!

98
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,880
I'm, uh, sorry, sir. One of the men
fell in the water and...

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,360
I don't care what happened, Lieutenant.
This is an assembly area.

100
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,160
You'll have all the military police
in Tobruk down here.

101
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,800
Company! Attention!

102
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
Ready for inspection, sir.

103
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,800
This the best you can do, Sergeant?

104
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,960
What do you think this is, bush week?

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,480
Straighten that line!

106
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,240
Who is this bright-eyed little...

107
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,760
Shut up, Mick. You're just asking for it.

108
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,920
That's better. Now where's
your commanding officer?

109
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,440
- Captain Currie? Down the dock, sir.
- Let's find him.

110
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:24,120
(glass shatters)

111
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,080
- But the...
- (whispering) Shut up!

112
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,760
Get your head down.

113
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,200
Man was seasick, sir. He, uh...

114
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,480
That's right, sir. A very weak stomach.

115
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,240
He's tight as a tick. Look at him.

116
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,520
Mr. Bartlett, sir.

117
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,280
Tammy.

118
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,800
Little Tammy MacRoberts.

119
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,760
What are you doing here?

120
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,440
I was about to ask you the same thing, sir.
You all right?

121
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,120
Perfectly. Not a care in the world.

122
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,640
- We'll take care of him, sir.
- No, no, he can't march in that condition.

123
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,200
Put him in my car.
You'll find it up there on the street.

124
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
I'll give you a lift, sir.

125
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,680
It's a pleasure, I assure you, Tammy.

126
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,400
Thank you.

127
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,800
Pete, Rusty.

128
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,040
Right. Easy, boy.

129
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,440
Easy.

130
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,480
(babbling)

131
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,040
All right, Lieutenant.
Let's find your Captain, uh...

132
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,880
Currie, sir.

133
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,400
Tom, give us a bit of help. Come on.

134
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,760
Lift him up here. Stay with him, Pete.

135
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,960
Comes up smelling like a rose every time.

136
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,000
He'll ride and we'll walk,

137
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
and that ruddy captain
will turn out to be his long-lost son.

138
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,520
(bomb approaching)

139
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,960
(groaning)

140
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,280
Where'd you get it, Jim?

141
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,760
Must have been a shell splinter.
Get his coat off.

142
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,320
All right, stand back.

143
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,920
- What are you men doing there?
- We have a man wounded, sir.

144
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,600
You'll have five more if you bunch up.

145
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,760
- Now get 'em moving.
- But he might die.

146
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,120
- Let the medics handle it.
- He's my best friend.

147
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,800
- Are you gonna get these men out of here?
- Yes, sir.

148
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,640
Take cover!

149
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,640
Now get up and get out of here!

150
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
Move out at the double!

151
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:01,080
Come on, move!
And spread out at the double!

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,400
Keep moving there.

153
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,240
Noisy show you're running, Tammy.

154
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,120
That fool of a lieutenant
could have had his platoon killed.

155
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,920
Ah, don't be too hard on him.

156
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,920
After all, it's only his first night here.

157
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,760
He'll never see another if he doesn't learn
something about Rommel's artillery.

158
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,400
You're still impatient.

159
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,400
You haven't changed much, Tammy.

160
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,480
Well, I suppose I haven't either.

161
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,200
I say, you haven't got
a little nip of something, have you?

162
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,240
It's all I've got.

163
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,920
I could have done with something stronger.

164
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,920
Ugh. What on earth is this?

165
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,120
Desert water. You'll get used to it, sir.

166
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,880
No one but a camel could get used to that.

167
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,120
Yes, and I wish you would stop "sir-ing" me.

168
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,880
You know, in our positions,
it's, well, a little embarrassing.

169
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,560
How did you get into this?

170
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,560
I suppose the way I get into everything.

171
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,120
A schoolmaster with the nickname
of "Blind Tom" doesn't last long.

172
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I got an idea I might find greener pastures
in one of the dominions.

173
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Unfortunately, I picked Australia,
where it appears everyone volunteers.

174
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,040
I made my usual mistake of being in a pub
the day war was declared,

175
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
and on a wave of beer suds, I...

176
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,800
You might at least
have got yourself a commission.

177
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,560
Commission? I'm the perfect private soldier.

178
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,280
No worries, no responsibilities.

179
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,200
I can't even be demoted.

180
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't believe that for a minute.

181
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,640
Being an infantryman
is the toughestjob in the Army.

182
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,680
You'll never...

183
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
(bomb approaching)

184
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Let me get you a transfer, sir.
I know a staff officer in headquarters that...

185
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,360
No. It's good of you, Tammy, but no.

186
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,040
I'd only mess that up, too.

187
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,120
And don't you worry about me.
You've got your own job.

188
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,120
All right.

189
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,720
There's your new home.

190
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,560
There's, uh, one thing
you might like to know, sir.

191
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,520
At school we all thought
you were the best of the lot.

192
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,800
When sober. Uh, good night, Tammy.

193
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,360
Good night, Captain.

194
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:51,040
And thank you, sir.

195
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,880
- You'll need about 2 feet more.
- 2 feet?

196
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,000
You'll wish it were 10 when the mortars stop
dropping. Then put the dirt in sandbags,

197
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,520
and camouflage the position with brush.

198
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,160
Anything else...

199
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,720
Sir?

200
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:08,160
Yes. Save that water. That's all you'll get.

201
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,760
Cheerful sort of a bloke.

202
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,320
What's an English officer doing
with Aussie troops, anyway?

203
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,240
The last time I heard,
we were still on the same side.

204
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,800
Now, listen, stow the chatter, mate,
and get on that banjo.

205
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,800
What's your field of fire, Mr. Carstairs?

206
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,640
480, sir.

207
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,320
- Better clear back here for a full circle.
- Behind us?

208
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:33,440
Behind you. The Afrika Korps
is not committed to frontal attack.

209
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,960
- Yes, sir.
- How's your ammunition?

210
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,800
The men are bringing it up now, sir.

211
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,760
<i>(plane flying overhead)</i>

212
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,280
Better get plenty.

213
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,240
That's practically your entire air support.

214
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,680
A bit free with the rough side of his tongue,
that pal of yours, Tom.

215
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,640
Yeah. I must have a word with him.

216
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,800
But he's right about them getting in
behind us. Let's get it cleared away.

217
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,240
On your feet, digger.

218
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,320
<i>(§ orchestra)</i>

219
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,240
<i>(§ orchestra)</i>

220
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,600
<i>(in German) Excellency,
General von Helmhotz.</i>

221
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,120
Kaffee. Helmhotz!

222
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,920
The weather observer
has something important, sir.

223
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,760
Schultz! Put it down here.

224
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,480
High-pressure area here.

225
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,400
- Low-pressure here. Prevailing eastern wind.
- And this?

226
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:30,160
- Sandstorm in the direction of Tobruk, sir.
- Sandstorm? Sandstorm!

227
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,080
- Yes, sir. A strong sandstorm.
- Thank you. You can go.

228
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,280
The tanks attack with the storm.

229
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,320
Please, sir?

230
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:43,960
Use the sandstorm. Immediately. Go! Ulrich!

231
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,760
That's a sandstorm, all right. Moving fast.

232
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Right.

233
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,480
(phone rings)

234
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,920
Roger. It's a sandstorm all right, sir.

235
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,720
- 5,000 yards out.
- Think they'll attack under cover of it?

236
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:10,000
If you were Rommel, wouldn't you?
Get me Colonel White.

237
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,040
Yes.

238
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,480
Yes, I see. Thank you, MacRoberts.

239
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,600
Same thing, sir. Sandstorm.

240
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
Mm-hmm. He'll come in with it.

241
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,720
It may even work for us.
Tank men can't hear anything.

242
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,760
Now they won't see much either.

243
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,840
(wind howling)

244
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,400
<i>(squeaking)</i>

245
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,000
What's up?

246
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,000
Tanks! I hear them!

247
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,760
Tank! You see it?

248
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,720
There's more than one of them.

249
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,760
Carstairs, sir.
Tanks moving across our front,

250
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,800
bearing 65 degrees
about a thousand yards out.

251
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,520
Have you double-checked that direction?

252
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,240
Yes, sir, with the perimeter
observers themselves.

253
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,080
It doesn't look as if they'd attack
where we thought, sir.

254
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,000
No, it doesn't.

255
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,760
Tell your commanders it may be necessary
to shift our forces at a moment's notice.

256
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,440
- And get Colonel White here immediately.
- Yes, sir.

257
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,080
Remember now,
you're under orders not to fire!

258
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,520
If they don't attack through here,
my guns will be useless.

259
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,600
- And it will take me time to move them, sir.
- Uh-huh.

260
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,240
- Mechanized equipment ready to move, sir.
- All right. Hold them.

261
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,960
Yes, sir.

262
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,960
Sir, don't you think
we'd better shift along with them?

263
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,800
Nope.

264
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,600
They're turning. Coming right down on us.

265
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,880
Now remember, hold your fire!

266
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
Column's turning! Coming in!

267
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,480
- Coming right over us.
- Get that gun off!

268
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,880
Under here, Tom!

269
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,440
Tom, get under here!

270
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,560
Tom, what's the matter with you?!

271
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,240
(men shouting)

272
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,320
Your attention, please, gentlemen.

273
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:09,080
Alert your artillery, Barney. I want to know
the moment the tanks start to fan out.

274
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,120
- What about fire discipline?
- Haven't fired a shot yet, sir.

275
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,360
There's two machine guns
that we can see, sir.

276
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,320
But there must be more.

277
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,120
Medium tanks passing "C" Battery, sir.
Within range of the Italian guns.

278
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,840
Hold your fire.

279
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,280
Hold your fire.

280
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,160
Range 500 yards and closing.

281
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,480
Yes, sir.

282
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,560
Hold fire!

283
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:23,080
Range 450 and closing.

284
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,840
Hold fire.

285
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,360
On target!

286
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,280
On target!

287
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,640
What are we waiting for?!

288
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,280
Orders.

289
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,520
Yes, I know. They're still coming in, sir.

290
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,840
Almost on top of the Italian guns now.

291
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,640
Release them to fire.

292
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,520
Yes, sir. Open fire.

293
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,080
- Fire!
- Fire!

294
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,800
(bullets whizzing)

295
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,480
Donaldson, get headquarters
and tell them to send us an antitank gun.

296
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,240
- Yes, sir.
- Get your reserves up and ready to move up.

297
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,040
It's Captain Currie.

298
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,080
He's alive.

299
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,920
The dirty...

300
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,320
- They're going after him.
- I need three men.

301
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,160
- (both) I'll go, sir.
- Cover us.

302
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,440
Look at that, sir.

303
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,080
- What's he doing leaving that position?
- Going out after the Captain.

304
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,320
Going aft... That idiot. That fantastic idiot.
He's left that position wide open.

305
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,800
- Take enough reserves and get up there.
- Yes, sir.

306
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,720
You heard him. Let's go.

307
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,280
- Donaldson, what about that antitank gun?
- When they can pull one out of the line.

308
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,640
Too late. What was that New Zealander's
name? We worked together in Bardia.

309
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,480
- Fitz...
- Fitzgibbon. Fitzhugh.

310
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,520
- Fitzhugh.
- See if you can find him.

311
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,840
Tell him we need that gun badly.
I'll try to get up to the perimeter.

312
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,520
I'm with you, Skipper.

313
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,240
You shouldn't have left your position. Get...

314
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,960
- Skipper?
- Harry, look!

315
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,560
- Of all the flaming...
- What is it?

316
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,920
The machine gunner must have copped it.

317
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,920
- We must get into that position before them.
- Let's go.

318
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,040
How many men have we got?

319
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:48,520
- There should be two more over there.
- Hey, Ginger! Bill!

320
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,880
Right here, Blue!

321
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,760
When we go, you go!

322
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,880
Right-o.

323
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,400
When you're ready, Captain.

324
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,760
Oh, you little beauty!

325
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,640
Oh, bless you, Fitzgibbons or Fitzhugh
or whatever your name is.

326
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,680
There's Carstairs, sir.

327
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:23,520
I reckon the old man must have bought one.

328
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,720
- Get up to the position.
- Right. Let's go!

329
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,280
Come on!

330
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,760
(gunshot)

331
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,520
- It's got to be the first one, Captain.
- Yes.

332
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,440
Traverse left.

333
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,360
Traverse left.

334
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,600
Traverse left.

335
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,520
Up a bit.

336
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,400
On target.

337
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,840
Aah!

338
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,600
We'll take care of him, sir.

339
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,120
Hey, what about your hand?

340
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,920
Position secured. Our tanks
and carriers chased them into the desert.

341
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,440
- That was a beaut shot on the tank, sir.
- Thanks. You got ammunition going up?

342
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:01,200
Yes, sir., and I've asked headquarters
for replacements on our casualties.

343
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,080
I want him put in for a decoration.

344
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,240
Yes, sir.

345
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,520
I want court-martial charges
prepared on Lieutenant Carstairs:

346
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,800
leaving his position
against orders and under fire.

347
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,160
Yes, sir.

348
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,360
He got the old man killed, didn't he?

349
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,280
The captain got himself killed.

350
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,760
He was there. Why didn't he go?

351
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,080
It was the company commander's job,
and he wasn't the company commander.

352
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,440
- Ah. Not then he wasn't. He is now.
- Yes, he is.

353
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,160
And whether you like him or not,
he's a good soldier.

354
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,280
Then let him soldier with
the king's flaming guards.

355
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,120
Listen, he saved your neck this afternoon,
and the position, too.

356
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Ah? Now I hear
he's court-martialing Carstairs.

357
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,160
What about that, Blue?

358
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,720
I wouldn't know.

359
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,440
- The C.O. 's boy.
- Why...

360
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:57,720
Sergeant Smith? Did you get the men
out to the forward position?

361
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,520
Just moving up, sir.

362
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,280
Come on. Get going. Come on. Move.

363
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,440
If any man goes to sleep
out there, I'll have him shot.

364
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,880
Get goin'!

365
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:15,000
There'll be none of that in my company,
or I'll tear you apart with me bare hands.

366
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,440
Better get down, Blue.
I was only thinking.

367
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,760
Never mind thinking.
You're a foot slogger.

368
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,800
Now get moving.

369
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,040
Captain?

370
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,600
Who is it?

371
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,080
Oh. You, sir.

372
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,960
How's your hand, Tammy?

373
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,040
Burning like brimstone.
How are you, sir?

374
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,120
I found a very deep hole.

375
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,560
If you can dig deep enough,
only your pride gets hurt.

376
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,480
Look, let me get you a transfer...

377
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,400
No, no, no. Don't say it again.

378
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,240
I'm afraid I might take you up on it.

379
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,800
- I wanted to talk about something else.
- Oh?

380
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,600
Harry Carstairs.

381
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,320
There's a rumor he's to be court-martialed.

382
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,840
It's no rumor. I forwarded the papers tonight.

383
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,200
But why, Tammy?

384
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,080
It was a perfectly natural
and courageous thing to do.

385
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:04,880
Certainly it was.
And that has nothing to do with it.

386
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,400
He disobeyed orders
and jeopardized the position.

387
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,440
- But he's just a boy.
- We've no use for boys here,

388
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
particularly not as officers.

389
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,240
You can't be much older than he is.

390
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,400
I don't know whether I am or not.

391
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,840
I do know that I've been here a year,

392
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:23,680
and one of the first things I learned was
that this isn't a game for children.

393
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,920
Men get killed and stay killed.

394
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,720
- I know that.
- I don't think you do, sir.

395
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,560
Only a line officer knows
that any decision he makes in battle

396
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,800
may involve somebody
being killed or wounded.

397
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:39,600
His job is to follow orders
and make decisions

398
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,280
without letting sentiment, loyalty, friendship
or anything else interfere.

399
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:49,240
When he can't do that, he might as well
get rid of whatever he's got up here.

400
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,520
He's no good to himself
or anybody else anymore.

401
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,320
That's a pretty cold estimate, Tammy.

402
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,560
Perhaps it is, but it's the truth.

403
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,440
(planes approaching)

404
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:05,040
(gunshots in distance)

405
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,960
They'll head for the harbor
and try to knock out our supply convoy.

406
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,480
How do you know?

407
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,080
I'm just guessing.
Would you sooner get in there?

408
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,680
Yes.

409
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,640
That's all there is to it.

410
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,240
Now, what's all this concern for an officer?

411
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
I thought you were a confirmed private.

412
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,800
I like him.

413
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,440
He's honest, fair to his men,
and for a young man, very understanding.

414
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,720
What'd he do, let you off
a couple of work details?

415
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,480
Well, maybe, but he's done other things.

416
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,400
He gave me the bottle that was responsible
for my, uh, condition the night we docked.

417
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
(chuckles) So that's what's behind it.

418
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,600
Well, no, no, not all.

419
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,800
It was the reason he did it.

420
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,360
Because he knew I was a coward
and that I'd fall apart without it.

421
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,000
Oh, come off it, sir. You're no more
of a coward than anybody else.

422
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,120
Yes, I am. You noticed itjust now.

423
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,960
I'm frightened to death.

424
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,080
Well, all of us are afraid part of the time.

425
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,360
You'll get used to all this.

426
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,600
No. No, I won't.

427
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,480
I get sick... physically sick...

428
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:28,560
and I want to run anyplace just to get away.

429
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:33,560
That's not right, sir. You shouldn't be in the
Army. You should get a medical discharge.

430
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,520
- The psychiatrists have...
- No. I'm afraid of that, too.

431
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,720
You don't know much
about real fear, Tammy.

432
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:44,640
Maybe it comes with age or the bottle.

433
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,560
You don't know what it is to be a coward...
really a coward.

434
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:52,960
To know it, you have to hope that one day
something will happen to prove you're not

435
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,200
and yet half the time
not really believing that either.

436
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,520
Oh, but I'm off the point
and I'm embarrassing you.

437
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,120
What I really wanted to ask you was

438
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,880
to withdraw the charges against Carstairs.

439
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,600
Withdraw them?

440
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,520
- Didn't you hear anything I said out there?
- Yes, I heard.

441
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,680
Then you ought to understand why I can't.

442
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,520
I know how you feel about him, sir, but...
I can't. No.

443
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,640
Tammy.

444
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,040
Do you remember a long time ago

445
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,800
your coming to my study
before a final exam?

446
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,000
The time I thought I was going to fail.

447
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,160
It seemed a terrible thing to me at the time.
Ruined me for life.

448
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,560
It might have.

449
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,440
You gave me a real going-over.
I remember that particularly.

450
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,440
I thought you were worth it.

451
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,160
I think Carstairs is, too.

452
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,960
That was in school, in peace time,

453
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,160
not in the middle of a war.

454
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
Besides, I passed the exam.

455
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,920
And I did, didn't I?

456
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,560
Yes. You passed.

457
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,400
Congratulations.

458
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,600
Thank you, sir.

459
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:31,160
Gentlemen, one of the few
real pleasures of rank

460
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,520
is the ability to make promotions in the field.

461
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,040
There's no question of your deserving them.

462
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,720
I congratulate you and I thank you.

463
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,240
Um, yes, uh, that'll be all.
Thank you, gentlemen.

464
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,120
Up! If you gentlemen will follow me,

465
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,680
I'll give you new orders.

466
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,400
- Congratulations, Mac.
- Men, come in for a minute.

467
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,040
I have a few matters
I want to discuss with you.

468
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,240
At ease, MacRoberts.

469
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,760
I have here court-martial papers
on Lieutenant Carstairs signed by you.

470
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,400
I also have a request for the dismissal
of the charges, also signed by you.

471
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,720
Yes, sir.

472
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,160
If these charges were as specified, the young
man endangered the entire operation.

473
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,760
And you still wish to withdraw the charges?

474
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,480
Yes, sir.

475
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,120
You realize, of course, that he will
succeed as company commander.

476
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,280
- Sir?
- He's the senior lieutenant.

477
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,960
He'll have a highly competent
battalion commander, sir.

478
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,640
- Of course.
- You need one.

479
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,760
Yes, yes.

480
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:39,200
As you know, Major,
we're extremely short of field officers,

481
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,400
so on the advice of Colonel White,
I'm giving you the battalion.

482
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,600
You'll assume a temporary rank
of lieutenant colonel.

483
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,280
- Yes, sir.
- Fast-moving war, isn't it, Major?

484
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,680
Now you'll have three Australian companies.

485
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,080
Congratulations, Colonel.

486
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,040
- I might have known...
- Careful, Colonel.

487
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:57,840
You may have seen the press dispatches
on our magnificent defense, MacRoberts.

488
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,480
I don't like them.

489
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:03,520
Defense is a state of mind. I don't want
our troops to fall into this type of thinking.

490
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:06,160
We're committed
to holding Tobruk for two months.

491
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,360
But unless we take the offensive,
Rommel will overcome us in a week.

492
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,400
- Or less.
- Yes.

493
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,760
We're in no position to mount a major attack,

494
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,600
but we can hit and run.

495
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,520
There are the German positions as accurately
as our intelligence can give them to us.

496
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,320
From now on,
every company on the perimeter

497
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,680
will raid one of these positions every night.

498
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,720
It'll be up to the battalion commanders
to select the targets, brief the companies

499
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,120
and send intelligence
a daily assessment of damage done.

500
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,000
Can you handle it?

501
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,880
- If that's it, that's it, sir.
- But...?

502
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,160
Well, casualties may be high.

503
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,880
These troops have been bloodied,
but they're still green.

504
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,880
They won't be for long.

505
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,320
And I'll look to you to keep casualties down.

506
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,800
Yes, sir.

507
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,760
That's all, Colonel, and good luck.

508
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,720
Thank you, sir.

509
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,360
- Good luck, Mac.
- Yeah.

510
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,760
Well, now what?

511
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Hmm? Oh, I was just thinking
how happy I am I'm not an infantryman.

512
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,160
Oh.

513
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,720
- We start with those.
- Mm-hmm. Right.

514
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,560
I won't lie to you. This is hard, dirty work.

515
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,680
But if it's done and done right, it'll pay off.

516
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,560
The Jerries don't like people
wandering about in the dark.

517
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,200
There's one thing you've got to remember:

518
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,880
if a man is killed or badly wounded,

519
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,880
you've got to leave him.

520
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
You can't endanger
the rest of your patrol for one man.

521
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,920
Understood?

522
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,480
- Yes, sir.
- Right.

523
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,800
That's it.

524
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,040
But, Colonel?

525
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,640
Well?

526
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,560
I wanted to, uh, thank you
for dropping those charges.

527
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,440
Don't thank me. Thank the General.
I had nothing to do with it.

528
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,600
The copy of your letter's
in the company files.

529
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,200
Oh.

530
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,680
Well, I could have made a mistake.

531
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,280
Maybe you did, but the thanks still goes.

532
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,360
- Good night, sir.
- Night.

533
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,680
He did drop the court-martial
proceedings, didn't he?

534
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,360
(Mick) How do I know he did?
Maybe the General told him to.

535
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,840
And what about his orders for tonight?

536
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,080
If a bloke cops one,
you flaming well leave him there.

537
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,240
You reckon he'd be so free
with English troops?

538
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,520
Put a sock in it back there. Let's go.

539
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:49,120
<i>(narrator) Night after night,
through the months of May and June,</i>

540
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,000
<i>little bands of desperate men
went out from Tobruk</i>

541
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:55,320
<i>to spread havoc,  confusion
and fear among the enemy.</i>

542
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,280
<i>On the vast dark stretches
of the Libyan desert</i>

543
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,760
<i>they ranged like their freebooter ancestors</i>

544
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,680
<i>who had once made England
mistress of the seas.</i>

545
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:09,720
<i>They struck in the darkness
and disappeared into darkness.</i>

546
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,320
(bullets whizzing)

547
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:02,280
<i>And in the cold light of dawn,
came back to their shell-pitted refuge.</i>

548
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
Go on. Get a move on, Fritz.

549
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,320
You reckon this'll make the colonel happy?

550
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,080
Oh, hysterical. He might even let us go out
tonight with our bare hands.

551
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:27,120
Come on, you. Get a move on. Get movin'.

552
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,000
You're a difficult man.
Also an intelligent one.

553
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,000
I think further questioning is useless,
don't you, Captain?

554
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,280
Definitely, sir.

555
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,840
Take him out, John.

556
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:42,480
I regret that I was of no assistance to you
gentlemen. Come along.

557
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,920
(phone rings)

558
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,280
Give me the clever ones every time. The
minute they get away from name and rank...

559
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,080
I cross-checked eight lies. And that business
of being a tank man. His collar tabs...

560
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,280
Stop taking bows.
Come along. The general's waiting for us.

561
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,320
No doubt about it, sir. Rommel's moved
his long-range guns up against us.

562
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,400
- It's obvious from the pounding we've taken.
- From what he said...

563
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,600
or rather, from the lies he told us, I'd bet
a month's pay that that's their encampment.

564
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,440
We thought it might be a rest area,

565
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,880
but that over here could be
a camouflaged gun emplacement,

566
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,600
and that and that.

567
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,200
And this spot here
that we thought was a firing range

568
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,960
- May be an underground ammunition dump.
- Barney?

569
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,440
Nothing could touch them.
They're out of our range.

570
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Could you find out if Rommel
was planning a new attack?

571
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,760
I mean, a major one?

572
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,480
Nothing as definite as that, but...

573
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:39,520
It sounded awfully like it to me, sir.

574
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:44,080
No other reason
for moving up heavy artillery.

575
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,600
I think we'll have to get
that ammunition dump, sir.

576
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,600
Commandos could never get in and out in
a night. Must be 20 miles from the perimeter.

577
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:52,280
If we could get an air strike...

578
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,640
No, not much use against
an underground dump.

579
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:57,520
That line there... that's a highway?

580
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Mmm, supply route from Benghazi.

581
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,440
There are still some Italian vehicles
they left behind with their guns, sir.

582
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:07,720
If we took them and could break through here
where that Italian regiment is holding,

583
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,000
we could cut to the highway
and drive down it.

584
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,680
And lose your expedition
first time it was challenged.

585
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,600
I'm not so sure, sir.
There must be men here who speak Italian.

586
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,240
Of course. And German.

587
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:21,040
I've got two Arabs in my section,
who'd lead you across the desert blindfolded.

588
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,760
Simple. Delightfully simple.

589
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,560
And has about one chance in a hundred.

590
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,080
Perhaps. What were the chances
of Rommel sending his Panzer Division in

591
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,720
where you said he would, sir?

592
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:32,240
Ha!

593
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,760
If your men are as cocksure as you are,
MacRoberts, they mightjust get through.

594
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,360
They've had two months of commando work
and are tired of being shelled 24 hours a day.

595
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,440
So am I.

596
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,640
It's a calculated risk,
but then, that's the whole theory of warfare.

597
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,360
- If we broke out here...
- Yes.

598
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,280
And you could give us
a diversionary attack say, here...

599
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,640
All right, fellas, make it snappy.

600
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,360
See you got all your papers ready.

601
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,000
Come on, come on. Hurry.

602
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,400
Any of you new men, remember:
you take nothing with you.

603
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,520
No identification, no letters,
no pictures of the kids or the old lady.

604
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,360
And don't take all day. The trucks are waiting.

605
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,080
Uh, Tom, that's for the old lady, just in case.

606
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:19,280
I'll give it back to you in the morning.

607
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:23,080
Marsch, there's four months' pay there, mate,
and I'd like to see it again.

608
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:26,960
Don't worry about the dough, chum.
Just worry about getting back in one piece.

609
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:29,840
- Tom'll have it for you, won't you, Tom?
- Yes, I will.

610
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,800
Tom's always here, no fear of that.

611
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:35,360
- Just don't take no chances while I'm gone.
- All right, all right.

612
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:38,360
What's the matter, Tommy?

613
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, nothing, nothing. I'm sorry.

614
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,400
(knocks on door)

615
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,200
Yes. Come in.

616
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,120
Oh, it's you, sir. What's up?

617
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:57,520
- I've come to ask you a favor, Tammy.
- I can do it. It's yours.

618
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,800
I want to go on this raid.
Honestly. It's important to me.

619
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:05,000
I believe it is. But why?

620
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,720
I'm the only man in this company
that's never been on one.

621
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:09,880
- Are they suggesting...
- It's nothing like that.

622
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
It's just seeing the men go each time,

623
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:15,400
and, well, looking after their valuables
and letters...

624
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,760
Oh, please, Tammy.
I'll try not to disgrace you.

625
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,760
Oh, it's not that.

626
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,080
It's just that I...

627
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,560
Well, I need you for something else.

628
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,880
I've just put through a request for you
to be transferred to me.

629
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,080
My paperwork's in a mess. I need someone
I know and trust on the files.

630
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,040
That's a lie, Tammy, isn't it?

631
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,600
You just made it up.

632
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:37,440
Well, part of it.

633
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,160
I am transferring you.

634
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,640
But this is a rough assignment.
Most won't come back.

635
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,920
- Well, there's no reason...
- You're not to go, and that's it!

636
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,680
I suppose, truthfully,
that's what I hoped you'd say.

637
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,800
You're probably right, too.

638
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,800
Look... you'll be four times
as valuable to me in an office

639
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:01,720
as you would be thrashing about with a gun.

640
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,200
And, uh, four times less dangerous.

641
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,720
- Pretty girl.
- Yes.

642
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,120
Someone from home?

643
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,200
Yes, from Scotland, that is. My wife.

644
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,320
I didn't know you were married.

645
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,480
Or to such a lovely girl.

646
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,280
Not much time for an announcement.

647
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,480
We did it in '39, just before I went to France.

648
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,440
Have you seen her since?

649
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,840
A week, after Dunkirk.

650
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,240
Any children?

651
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,760
One. Little boy.

652
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,680
And you've never seen him.

653
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,640
No.

654
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:47,920
That's tough.

655
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,640
But all wars come to an end sometime.
This one will, too.

656
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,520
If I have anything to do with it, it will.

657
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,920
(picks up papers)

658
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,880
- Look after these for me.
- Yeah.

659
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,040
If I don't...

660
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,840
I'll see you tomorrow.

661
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:14,720
<i>(narrator) And so on the 9th of July, 1941,</i>

662
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,600
<i>(narrator) And so on the 9th of July, 1941,</i>

663
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,760
<i>began one of the most daring raids
of the North African campaign.</i>

664
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,760
<i>With their sole objective
a gigantic ammunition dump,</i>

665
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,960
<i>54 picked men jammed into
three captured Italian trucks</i>

666
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:31,840
<i>and prepared themselves for a wild ride.</i>

667
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,720
30 seconds.

668
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,640
Remember, once that dump blows,
you're on your own.

669
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,000
Never mind about anybody else.
Get your men out.

670
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:57,480
(explosions in distance)

671
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,760
Good luck.

672
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,400
Get that back up, too.

673
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:16,040
Easy One to all units.
Follow me. Stay close. Let's go.

674
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,000
- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

675
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,240
Looks like a roadblock, sir.

676
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,040
Slow down but keep rolling,
whatever happens.

677
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,080
Easy One to all units.

678
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,600
Proceed with Plan "C."
Keep moving. Follow us.

679
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,880
<i>(in German) Roadblock. Travel orders.</i>

680
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:40,320
(in Italian) We belong to the Florentine group.
We are going to the front.

681
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:43,400
<i>- (in German) Your travel orders, please.
- Keep talking.</i>

682
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:47,880
(in Italian) We have orders. Understand?
Order of General Rommel. We can't stop.

683
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
<i>(in German) Wait, now. You can't... Stop!</i>

684
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:56,000
(man) What happened, Muller?

685
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,840
Crazy Italians.

686
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,280
They don't even know where they want to go.
May the devil take them.

687
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,360
We'll be there in a minute.

688
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,760
- Keep your eyes peeled for a wadi.
- Yes, sir.

689
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,960
That's it ahead. Pull in.
Give the rest of them room to clear.

690
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,560
The camp is 200 yards down the road.

691
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,360
All those detailed,
dismount and proceed to stations.

692
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,080
Convoy will follow in three minutes.

693
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:39,120
No contact until you see the flare. Get going.

694
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,760
Down!

695
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,360
Aah!

696
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,920
Uhh!

697
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,440
(shouts)

698
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:44,320
That's it. Dead ahead.

699
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,320
All right, men, let's get 'em!

700
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,360
Take care of those wounded. Come on!

701
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,520
See if you can get that gun working.

702
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,320
Demolition team!

703
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:23,600
Quickly now!

704
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:38,960
Let's have a wire, quick!

705
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,960
Come on! Come on!

706
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,440
All set, Colonel!

707
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,320
Clear, everybody!

708
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:56,520
(whistle blowing)

709
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,680
Come on! Come on! Let's go!

710
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,680
Get 'em out of here!

711
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,760
Get moving!

712
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,040
Get moving!

713
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,080
- Ready, Colonel.
- That's it. Get in the trucks.

714
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,760
Get in there.

715
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,560
Let her go!

716
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,040
Get 'em out of here!

717
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:34,160
Get 'em out of here!

718
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,160
Can't you ever obey an order?!
Get out of here!

719
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,920
Shut up and push the ruddy plunger!

720
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,360
Come on! We can still get out!

721
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,240
Carstairs! We can still get out!

722
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,800
We can still get out! Carstairs!

723
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,640
<i>(man,  speaking German)
Take prisoners! Take prisoners!</i>

724
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:18,200
Get me a prisoner, understand?

725
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:20,560
There! Over there!

726
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,600
There's one of them!

727
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,320
Wet down all canvas!

728
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,800
Look there, corporal!

729
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:29,000
Leave him alone!

730
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:32,640
<i>(man speaks German indistinctly)</i>

731
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,560
<i>(in German) Put six men on that hose!</i>

732
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,680
(MacRoberts) You butcher,
keep your hands off me!

733
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,560
<i>(speaks German)</i>

734
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,600
Colonel...

735
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,360
I am a lieutenant colonel and
I demand to be treated according to my rank!

736
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,080
If he touches me again,
I'll break every bone in his body!

737
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,160
- If your wound is to be dressed...
- Get a doctor!

738
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:15,040
By the terms of the Geneva Convention
I'm entitled to one.

739
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,040
Now get a doctor here,
you incompetent clown!

740
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:20,760
<i>(in German) Call a doctor here.</i>

741
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,600
A doctor will come, Colonel.

742
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,240
That's better.

743
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:30,360
(humming)

744
00:56:30,440 --> 00:56:34,760
<i>(in German) There is
a wounded English officer.</i>

745
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,120
He wants a doctor,
something like on grounds of a...

746
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,040
(haltingly)... Geneva Convention?

747
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,120
It's called Geneva Convention.
You're getting all the time more stupid.

748
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,600
Yes, doctor.

749
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,440
There are certain questions...

750
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,560
<i>When you get a doctor here, I'll be happy
to discuss them, Herr Leutnant,  not until.</i>

751
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,000
<i>(in German) Couldn't you do it without me?</i>

752
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Are you a doctor or another faith healer?

753
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,240
- Huh?
- A doctor! Are you a reputable doctor?

754
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,960
<i>- (in German) What does he want?
- He wants to know if you're a good doctor.</i>

755
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:07,920
I studied in Heidelberg and Tosten in Vienna.

756
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:10,400
You see, sir, the bullet...

757
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:11,800
<i>(in German) Quiet.</i>

758
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,800
Let's not barge into things too quickly.

759
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,560
<i>(in German) Quiet. Stay still.</i>

760
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,640
Jensen, a probe.

761
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,120
Ha, passed right at the artery.
A difficult position.

762
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,800
A little higher and
it'd be a bone splinter. Ha-ha.

763
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:39,120
(groans)

764
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,360
I hope you roast in a flaming fire.

765
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,040
<i>(in German)
Well, just one more moment and...</i>

766
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:47,960
Brandy, quick!

767
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:51,760
(glasses clink)

768
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,160
<i>(in German) Drink.</i>

769
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:56,520
That'll taste fine.

770
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,400
Ready. Good!

771
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:07,280
<i>Very good, Herr doctor.</i>

772
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,280
<i>(in German) You see...</i>

773
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,480
Obviously got your training before Hitler.

774
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,320
<i>(in German) What does he want from Hitler?</i>

775
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,920
(vehicle door closes)

776
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,920
<i>(in German) Here, Field Marshal.</i>

777
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,080
Doctor! Doctor, quick!

778
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,760
One moment, one moment. Please.

779
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:25,240
The Field Marshal is wounded.

780
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:27,600
Jensen, finish this.

781
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,360
What happened?

782
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,440
- A machine-gun bullet.
- Damned spitfire...

783
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,800
A spitfire. Nothing trivial, I trust.

784
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,760
Shut up, you!

785
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,920
<i>(in German) Quiet!</i>

786
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,720
You have the advantage of me.

787
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,720
- Colonel MacRoberts, sir.
- A pleasure.

788
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:44,680
<i>(in German) He conducted an attack
on our ammunition store.</i>

789
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,400
<i>(in German) Is that so?</i>

790
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,680
I have not yet inspected the damage, but
from what I hear you are to be complimented.

791
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,280
Thank you, sir.

792
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,040
My heavy artillery must have interested you.

793
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,200
It was perhaps making life exciting in Tobruk.
Or are we confined

794
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,160
to name, rank and serial number? (grunts)

795
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,720
Only when you touch a tender spot, sir.

796
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,920
Uh-huh. Well, we will devote
ourselves to general subjects.

797
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,040
Your commanding general, for instance.

798
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:16,240
Tell me, MacRoberts,
since it is now long past,

799
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:19,880
was it he who organized the defense
against my panzer attack

800
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:21,440
or was it Cairo?

801
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:23,240
It was the general.

802
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:27,640
If I remember correctly, he described your
attack as a highly limited tactical maneuver.

803
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,680
Yes, yes.

804
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,280
It had worked well for us,
but I used it once too often.

805
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,640
- I underestimated your man, Colonel.
- Grave mistake, sir.

806
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:43,200
Yes. But he is Australian,
and you are English, no?

807
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:45,360
My intelligence has given me to understand

808
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:48,200
there was considerable friction
between the two.

809
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,600
I would suggest some changes
in your staff, sir.

810
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:51,560
(chuckles)

811
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,400
It will be interesting to meet this man
the British think so highly of.

812
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:56,600
When will that be, sir?

813
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,480
Mmm? Oh, I imagine whenever I decide
we've had enough of your Tobruk.

814
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:03,080
I would have thought
that might have been weeks ago.

815
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,280
Colonel, I fully understand your natural pride
in holding a position,

816
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,320
and since it is the only position
the British hold,

817
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:13,600
I can understand
the extravagant claims for it.

818
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,920
Actually, it plays little part in our plans.

819
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,360
<i>(in German) Please, excellency.</i>

820
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,320
Uh-huh. I'm afraid my general
has other ideas.

821
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,280
I suppose he has,
but even you must be aware

822
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:28,520
that my forward elements are within
200 kilometers of Alexandria

823
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:31,320
and that within the month
we will have taken Cairo.

824
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,880
<i>(in German) Yes, excellency.</i>

825
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,560
- Not until you take Tobruk.
- Oh, now, MacRoberts, I respect your pride

826
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,840
in this little rathole you call Tobruk,

827
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,680
but don't insult my intelligence

828
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:43,920
by telling me that if it stood in my way

829
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:45,760
I couldn't crush it like that.

830
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,600
Sir...

831
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,080
Normally, I would defer to your rank

832
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,240
and the fact that I'm your prisoner.

833
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,200
If you can crush Tobruk, crush it.

834
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,520
But don't tell me it isn't a constant threat
to your supply line,

835
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,360
that it isn't an open sore in your side, or that
you can take Egypt without first smashing it.

836
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,800
<i>(officer) Silence.
You are addressing the Excellency.</i>

837
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,280
<i>(in German) Quiet, Kramm. Let him talk.</i>

838
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,000
And this is what keeps you
in those flea-ridden caves?

839
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,920
That's part of it.

840
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:17,320
And the rest?

841
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,080
Well, the rest is that by holding Tobruk,

842
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,000
we prevent you from taking the Suez.

843
01:01:23,120 --> 01:01:26,080
And if you don't take the Suez,

844
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,680
I suggest you start planning for the next war.

845
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:32,600
Cognac for the field marshal.

846
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:34,040
You British pig!

847
01:01:34,120 --> 01:01:37,920
<i>Leutnant! Halt!</i>

848
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:42,880
<i>(in German) Take it away!</i>

849
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,920
Colonel, you are a brave man,
and were you not so stubborn,

850
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,760
I might have enjoyed
your conversation more.

851
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,680
When I have brought
your country to its knees,

852
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,000
it is possible we may meet again.

853
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:00,080
This gentleman seems to have other ideas.

854
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,520
You are a prisoner of war
and will be treated as such.

855
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,880
<i>- (in German) Kramm, take care of this.
- Yes, excellency.</i>

856
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,280
Thank you, sir.

857
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:34,960
<i>(man speaking German indistinctly)</i>

858
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,040
Quicker, down.

859
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:47,840
Here, in, out, faster,
before the planes are back.

860
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:54,720
Everybody out. (continues indistinctly)

861
01:03:54,840 --> 01:03:57,520
<i>(engine revving)</i>

862
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,280
What do you think, sir?

863
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:24,440
Well, we can't move by daylight
and we've got a long trip tonight.

864
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:26,280
Time for some sleep.

865
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,360
Yeah.

866
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:53,600
<i>(man speaking German) Who's there?</i>

867
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:55,840
What is it now?

868
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,360
I heard something over there.

869
01:04:58,440 --> 01:04:59,480
Move away.

870
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,720
<i>- Ahh!
- (in German) I'm sure I heard something.</i>

871
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:47,560
(sighs)

872
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,240
I'd give my stripe for a mouthful of water.

873
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:53,440
You'll have a bellyful
when you get to Tobruk,

874
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,600
if I don't take the wrong turning.

875
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,880
Well...

876
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,360
- Somebody out there.
- Where?

877
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,080
Down by the wire. Put a burst
over their heads. It may be our patrol.

878
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,720
Who goes there?!

879
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:28,640
Oh, break it down, you mugs! I had me
flaming foot caught in the flaming wire!

880
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,640
It's Bluey!

881
01:06:32,080 --> 01:06:34,760
Stone the crows. It's the colonel, too.

882
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,480
What about Harry?

883
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:40,520
I mean, the captain, sir?

884
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,920
He bought one. I'm sorry.

885
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,720
If you'd lowered your aim a bit,

886
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,880
you could've gotten me, too.

887
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:16,360
<i>(narrator) The heavy and desperate fist of
Rommel fell on Tobruk again and again...</i>

888
01:07:21,320 --> 01:07:25,840
<i>through the Luftwaffe,
massed artillery and frontal attack.</i>

889
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,400
(explosion)

890
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:31,240
<i>The men of Tobruk had been
asked to hold for two months.</i>

891
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:33,280
<i>By July,  they had held for four.</i>

892
01:07:36,280 --> 01:07:39,160
<i>Through August they held.</i>

893
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,480
<i>September, October.</i>

894
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:46,440
<i>In Egypt,  an army was being rebuilt
during these precious months.</i>

895
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,160
<i>In November...</i>

896
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:51,440
Our relief column under General Auchinleck
has broken out of Egypt

897
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,560
and is quite definitely on the move.

898
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,440
The general will push
straight across here to us.

899
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:02,000
Our supply convoy, already at sea,
will arrive here tomorrow night.

900
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,840
I don't need to tell you yourjobs,

901
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,240
nor do I need to tell you this column
will be in vital need of supplies.

902
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:12,080
(explosion)

903
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:17,840
I think that both Rommel and I can promise
you a very interesting week ahead.

904
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:19,440
MacRoberts?

905
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,080
Same thing last night, sir.
On the move along the front.

906
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:25,800
Yes. I think you'll find pressure
all around our defenses.

907
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:29,840
However, it seems to me
that this hill... Ed Duda...

908
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:31,880
is a key position.

909
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:36,480
It commands the Bardia Road
and our supply road to the harbor.

910
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:39,360
Consequently, I'll have
to move troops to hold it.

911
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,320
But I can only spare one battalion,

912
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:45,040
so it'll have to be our best
and most experienced one.

913
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,160
That's it, gentlemen.

914
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,160
We will hold for three days or until relieved.

915
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:55,320
We will need every round
of ammunition we can carry.

916
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,120
- Start moving the men out right away.
- Yes, sir.

917
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:02,040
- Any questions?
- Well, I...

918
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,560
I just wondered why it had to be us.
After all, we've been in the line the longest...

919
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:09,320
In the first place, it's an order.
In the second, if it's any good to you,

920
01:09:09,440 --> 01:09:13,000
the general asked for the best
and most experienced troops.

921
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:14,760
Is that all?

922
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:16,120
Yes.

923
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:23,400
Well, that'll put the cap on it,
if nothing else does.

924
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,520
There'll be some choice comment on this.

925
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,080
Oh, come off it, sir. It's only an order.

926
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:31,200
They may even get a kick out of the general
choosing their battalion.

927
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:35,120
Uh-huh, and I may even run
for prime minister of Australia.

928
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,040
(blows whistle)

929
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,920
- What's up, Blue?
- The war over, Blue? We getting relieved?

930
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,240
- Beer ration?
- Don't sit on it until it hatches, Blue.

931
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,360
You gents will be proud and happy to know

932
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:51,160
the general considers you
the pick of the garrison.

933
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,280
- Here we go again.
- Another dirty deal.

934
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,080
Consequently, you've been selected

935
01:09:56,200 --> 01:10:00,320
to hold the key position in the coming
festivities. We're moving out.

936
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,720
Oh, that ruddy MacRoberts. He's volunteered
us again. He's pushing for general.

937
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,480
(laughs)

938
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:09,240
Rally 'round and
I'll show you the points of interest.

939
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:11,520
Now, this here's Ed Duda.

940
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,200
The mob's supposed to be coming up from
Cairo, and we're gonna hold it for three days.

941
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,880
<i>(narrator) They were asked
to hold for three days.</i>

942
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:23,160
<i>eight freezing nights of roaring gunfire,</i>

943
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:27,600
<i>eight blazing days of searching the horizon
for a sign of the relief column.</i>

944
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,640
<i>On the morning of the ninth day...</i>

945
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:38,880
See anything?

946
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:43,920
Not a ruddy thing.

947
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,880
"Just hold it for three days,
and the relief column will be along."

948
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,840
Well, it's eight flaming days now,
and there ain't a sight of them.

949
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:12,720
Gone back to ruddy Egypt, I reckon.

950
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,800
One more night of this,
and they'll take me off in a sack.

951
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,600
They'll be along in a bit.

952
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:22,400
In a bit! Yeah, in a bit! Always in a bit!

953
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:25,600
Well, I ain't waitin'! I can't...

954
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:30,200
(sobbing)

955
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,000
Let me up.

956
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:37,480
All right now?

957
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,080
Yeah.

958
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,400
Give me another tin of grub.

959
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:17,440
Three wounded and two dead.

960
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:20,880
Company strength down to 57 men.

961
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:26,360
About a thousand rounds of
small arms ammo and 23 mortar bombs.

962
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,920
And "C" Company?

963
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,240
Lost four more last night.

964
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:33,200
Down to 41 men, one officer,

965
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,280
1,200 rounds, 17 mortar.

966
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:39,200
One machine gun completely destroyed.

967
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,640
You'll have to take command of "A"
Company. What about the forward post?

968
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,640
That's where we lost two of our four, sir.

969
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:46,080
Is it manned now?

970
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,240
Well, no. I...

971
01:12:51,280 --> 01:12:53,600
I haven't been able to pick the men, Colonel.

972
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:58,080
Four hours is about as long
as anyone lasts out there.

973
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:01,960
- I thought after they had breakfast...
- All right. Let it go.

974
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,880
If headquarters could
send us some replacements...

975
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,200
They can't. Rommel's throwing everything
he's got all around the perimeter.

976
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,240
I don't suppose there'll be
any change in orders?

977
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:22,160
If there is, I'll tell you!

978
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:27,000
Change, change.
What are they asking me for?

979
01:13:27,120 --> 01:13:29,200
I don't give the orders. I just obey them.

980
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:31,200
Headquarters told me to hold. I can't!

981
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:37,960
Get me headquarters.

982
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:41,360
Let them decide.

983
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:44,360
- Colonel Orten?
- Yes.

984
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:46,320
Diamond Red.

985
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,400
Coming on.

986
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:53,960
MacRoberts here.

987
01:13:55,480 --> 01:13:58,000
It was a tank roadblock,
but they knocked it out last night.

988
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:00,560
They're moving now, Mac.

989
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,600
By 9:00, Mac. Noon at the latest.

990
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:06,520
No good, Orten.
You told me that four days ago.

991
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,520
No. We've had it. We're through, finished.
The first attack will sweep the hill.

992
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:17,840
- Maybe we can detach a unit...
- Don't lie to him. Let me have it.

993
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,000
MacRoberts?

994
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:21,440
Yes, sir?

995
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,320
There isn't a chance of getting anything
to you for at least six hours. Maybe not then.

996
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,360
I've called for air strikes, but...

997
01:14:28,480 --> 01:14:32,280
They've been pounded for eight days,
General. I'm down to less than a company.

998
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:36,760
I know. All I can tell you is
the relief column is moving.

999
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:39,200
Maybe one hour, maybe four.

1000
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:44,000
All I can do is release you to make
your own estimate of the situation.

1001
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:47,760
Whatever you do, I'll back yourjudgment.

1002
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:51,520
Yes, sir.

1003
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,000
Thank you, sir.

1004
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,040
Thank you for what?

1005
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,240
Dumping it back in my lap.

1006
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,800
The old army game.
My estimate of the situation.

1007
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,800
Well, what else can he do? He's not here.

1008
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,440
- He can only trust yourjudgment and hope...
- And hope I pull off a miracle,

1009
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:15,160
take what's left of a battalion...

1010
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:17,640
- Make the right decision.
- The right decision...

1011
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:22,240
Jerry artillery moving out in the desert, sir,
and plenty of it.

1012
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,680
Tell the platoon commanders to await orders.

1013
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,600
- Right, sir.
- Get the artillery.

1014
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:29,560
Tell them we want covering fire
when we pull out.

1015
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,400
Call 'em. What are you waiting for?

1016
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,360
Are you sure that's what you want, Tammy?

1017
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:35,880
Suppose they stand off one more attack?
The general...

1018
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,200
They'll be lucky to have the strength to march
out of here, let alone stand off Germans.

1019
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:43,480
- Well, they might, if you asked them to.
- If I asked them.

1020
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,760
I might have known it.

1021
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,240
Now let's forget the old school tie
nonsense and face reality for once.

1022
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,320
I'm the English colonel that got their captain
killed, that got Carstairs killed.

1023
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,560
The pommy officer that's whipped them in
and out of these caves for nine months.

1024
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,560
They'd rather see me dead than Rommel.

1025
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:06,520
No, Tammy. You don't understand men yet.

1026
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,000
Oh, I don't say they love you,
but they do know you.

1027
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:12,120
You're authority to them.

1028
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,240
The general, why, he's just a name.

1029
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,000
You're the one that's running their war.

1030
01:16:18,040 --> 01:16:21,840
If you give the order, they won't like it,

1031
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:24,120
but they're just stubborn enough to follow it.

1032
01:16:24,240 --> 01:16:26,640
Uh-huh. And my order is to pull out.

1033
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:29,200
Get the artillery. That's an order.

1034
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,600
You know that if Rommel takes this hill,

1035
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,000
the advance could be held up for days.

1036
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:36,720
Quite a tactician. Get the artillery.

1037
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,600
The general said that there may be a...

1038
01:16:38,680 --> 01:16:40,840
You drunken old fool!

1039
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,760
There are over 100 men out there,
and I'm responsible for them.

1040
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:47,720
If I order them to stay, they'll be killed!
I can't ask them for what they haven't got!

1041
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:49,680
I can't do it and I won't do it!

1042
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:56,480
I'm old, I'm a drunk and maybe I'm a fool.

1043
01:16:56,600 --> 01:17:00,760
But I do know what I'm talking about.

1044
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:03,680
Don't take all this on yourself, Tammy.

1045
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,800
Everybody needs help sometimes.

1046
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:10,800
Let them help you. Ask them.

1047
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:13,400
No. I've had it.

1048
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,720
I can't.

1049
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,000
All right.

1050
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,120
It's your decision, but if you make it,

1051
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,400
you'll be no good to yourself
or to anybody else.

1052
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,720
You told me that yourself once.

1053
01:17:27,840 --> 01:17:28,960
Remember?

1054
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,680
Then I'll be no good to myself.

1055
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,440
Ah, Tammy, an hour and...

1056
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,680
Don't call me that!

1057
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:39,040
Go and tell each of the commanders we'll
move out in 20 minutes, and that's an order!

1058
01:17:39,160 --> 01:17:41,400
Yes... sir.

1059
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,240
Devil? Give me Colonel White.

1060
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,960
Barney? I'm pulling out in 20 minutes.

1061
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:21,440
Give me all the covering fire you can spare.

1062
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:23,400
It's that rough, Mac?

1063
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,280
It's that rough.

1064
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:29,520
I'll put up a green flare when we're ready.

1065
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,320
Sir, I think they have an O.P.
dug in on this first rise.

1066
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:21,960
Well, if that's the case,
perhaps we can manage to get some...

1067
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:28,040
What's the matter with you?
I ordered you to get these men out of here.

1068
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,720
- Where's Bartlett? I'll have him...
- He told us, sir.

1069
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:33,320
But it don't make no difference.
The men won't go.

1070
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:44,800
We ain't going either.

1071
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,040
Won't go?

1072
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,760
I, uh...

1073
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:01,040
Where's Bartlett?

1074
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,280
He went out to the forward
position, sir, alone.

1075
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,040
That'll be him.

1076
01:20:07,160 --> 01:20:09,880
(siren wailing)

1077
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,840
- Barrage!
- Come on!

1078
01:20:12,920 --> 01:20:15,840
(bombing in distance)

1079
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,280
In there!

1080
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,680
Fix bayonets!

1081
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,960
Come out of your holes, you desert rats!

1082
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:34,840
Let's go. You! You!

1083
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,680
Come on! This is it!

1084
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:40,520
Come on! Fix bayonets!

1085
01:22:40,600 --> 01:22:43,000
Get out of your holes,
you desert rats! Let's go!

1086
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,280
You go! Come on! You, you!

1087

1088
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:08,080

What about Bartlett?
