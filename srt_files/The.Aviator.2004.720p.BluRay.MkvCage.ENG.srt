1
00:01:11,322 --> 00:01:13,615
Q-U ...

2
00:01:13,783 --> 00:01:15,784
... A-R ...

3
00:01:18,454 --> 00:01:20,664
... A-N-T ...

4
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,377
... I-N-E.

5
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,216
Quarantine.

6
00:01:31,843 --> 00:01:34,886
Q-U-A-R ...

7
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:40,434
... A-N-T ...

8
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:43,687
... I-N-E.

9
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,856
Quarantine.

10
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:47,608
You know the cholera?

11
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:49,318
Yes, Mother.

12
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,404
You've seen the signs on
the houses where the coloreds live?

13
00:01:52,572 --> 00:01:54,239
Yes, Mother.

14
00:01:54,407 --> 00:01:55,699
You know the typhus?

15
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,909
I do, Mother.

16
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,873
You know what they
can do to you?

17
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:05,250
Yes, Mother.

18
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:11,548
You are not safe.

19
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:22,184
You may be directing this movie,
but what you're asking, we can't do.

20
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,228
Don't tell me it can't be done.

21
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,149
The gyro forces are too much.
You send these planes into barrel rolls ...

22
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:32,819
... they won't make it.
- It's the climax of the picture. Make it work.

23
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,489
Decrease the vertical trajectory
if you have to.

24
00:02:35,657 --> 00:02:38,158
A "Le Rhône" rotary
won't stall at 60 degrees.

25
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:41,912
We're still short two cameras.
We need to cut that sequence down --

26
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,457
We're not cutting. I'll get those cameras.
Set up for rehearsals.

27
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:48,418
I'm Noah Dietrich.
Your office said I'd find you here.

28
00:02:48,586 --> 00:02:50,712
Dietrich.
You're a man on the come.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,716
I read your résumé, talked to your
references. Know what I'm looking for?

30
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:57,928
You're looking for a second-in-command
at Hughes Tools.

31
00:02:58,096 --> 00:03:00,847
Someone to oversee
the financial aspects of the business.

32
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:03,767
I'm looking for somebody to run it
and do a good job.

33
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:06,228
There's only one thing
you've gotta know.

34
00:03:06,396 --> 00:03:09,231
My folks, they're gone now.
So it's my money.

35
00:03:09,399 --> 00:03:13,110
What I do with that money may seem crazy
to those sons of bitches in Houston.

36
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,863
I'm sure it does, but it all makes
good sense to me. You got that?

37
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:18,824
- Got it.
- Good.

38
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:22,119
Now, you made, what,
$5200 a year at your last job?

39
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:26,164
- I'll pay you $10,000.
- I guess I'll be working twice as hard.

40
00:03:26,332 --> 00:03:29,918
You'll be working four times as hard.
I just got you at half price.

41
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,586
- Welcome aboard.
- Thank you.

42
00:03:31,754 --> 00:03:33,922
You're my voice now.
Make them understand that.

43
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,260
Some of those folks still call me Junior.
You tell them it's "Mr. Hughes" now.

44
00:03:38,428 --> 00:03:40,512
You bet.
So when do we go to Houston?

45
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,974
We don't. Cholera epidemic in 1913.
Two thousand dead.

46
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:46,184
Whole place is nothing but
pestilential swamp.

47
00:03:46,352 --> 00:03:50,480
Typhus, malaria, cholera, yellow fever.
You name it, they got it.

48
00:03:50,648 --> 00:03:52,107
You see that, Mr. Dietrich?

49
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,154
You are looking at the largest
private air force in the entire world.

50
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:59,364
What do you think of that, now?

51
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:02,325
It's your money.

52
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,911
Start them up!

53
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:34,709
I saw the rough cut of the new
Tod Browning movie, London After Midnight.

54
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,670
Lon Chaney is incredible.

55
00:05:36,838 --> 00:05:39,172
It's his best performance
in a long time.

56
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,675
It's gonna be a big hit.
The cards are great.

57
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:43,260
It's supposed to be --

58
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,887
Hello, Mr. Mayer.

59
00:05:46,055 --> 00:05:49,057
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Howard Hughes.

60
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:51,601
I was wondering
if I could have a moment.

61
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,813
- Oh, Howard Hughes. The airplane picture?
- Exactly.

62
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,315
- I remember.
- Hell's Angels. You heard of it.

63
00:05:57,483 --> 00:05:58,733
- Good.
- Yes.

64
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,695
I was wondering if I could
have a moment of your time.

65
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:03,154
I need a few cameras.

66
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,992
- Yeah?
- Yeah, two, to be exact.

67
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,955
I bought every camera I could find.
We're shooting our big dogfight sequence.

68
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:15,542
I need two more. Desperately.
You think MGM could help me out?

69
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:17,085
With what?

70
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,046
- Cameras.
- Oh, with the actual cam --

71
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:23,425
We're not usually in the practice
of helping out competition.

72
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,720
- No. No.
- So how many cameras do you have now?

73
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:28,263
Twenty-four.

74
00:06:30,808 --> 00:06:33,435
You ...?
Wait a minute.

75
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:37,564
- You have 24 cameras?
- That's right.

76
00:06:37,732 --> 00:06:40,317
- And you need --? You need two more?
- Yeah.

77
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:44,112
- You don't think you got it with 24?
- No. No, sir.

78
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,907
You know, I think --
I think we've got them all ...

79
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,492
Don't we have them ...?
They're all used, right?

80
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:51,953
- All 26 of them.
- I only need two, sir.

81
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,997
- Jesus Christ, sonny.
- Howard.

82
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,833
Howard. Let me give you
a little advice, huh?

83
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,085
- Take your oil money --
- Drill bits.

84
00:06:59,253 --> 00:07:02,339
All right, take your drill-bit money
and put it in the bank.

85
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:05,175
If you continue making
the movie the way you are ...

86
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,636
... there isn't gonna be a distributor ...

87
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:10,764
... you won't find anybody
who wants to see the movie ...

88
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,600
... and you're not gonna have
any more oil money.

89
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:16,811
So welcome to Hollywood.

90
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:20,357
Yeah. Well, I'll be sure
to remember that, Mr. Mayer.

91
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,359
- Good luck.
- All right.

92
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:25,695
He needs 26 to make it work?
He's out of his mind.

93
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:35,789
I looked down at my pants.
It was a strange situation.

94
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,377
Boss.
Scram, love boat, let's go.

95
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:44,631
- Another soda. You know what I mean.
- Milk. In the bottle.

96
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:47,759
- With the cap still on.
- Okay, what did His Highness say?

97
00:07:47,927 --> 00:07:51,137
Son of a bitch won't part with
a single goddamn camera.

98
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,848
Why don't you try and
make do with what you have.

99
00:07:54,392 --> 00:07:57,185
What I have isn't enough, John,
not for how I see it.

100
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:58,853
Look.

101
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:02,941
My name depends on this picture.
If it doesn't work, I'm back to Houston ...

102
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:05,902
... making goddamn drill bits
for the rest of my life.

103
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:08,238
Can't you do it
with the cameras you have?

104
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,199
You ought to hear about
what's going on with DeMille.

105
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:15,620
He's shooting his Bible picture.
He's gotta do a crucifixion in Fresno.

106
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,038
Johnny.

107
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:19,290
- A bunch of tractors --
- Johnny.

108
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,626
- You're a press agent, are you not?
- Yeah.

109
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,920
You're supposed to know
the ins and outs?

110
00:08:24,088 --> 00:08:25,338
- Absolutely.
- Do you?

111
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,756
Yeah, absolutely.

112
00:08:26,924 --> 00:08:28,967
Then you leave the big ideas ...

113
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:31,720
... to me.
- Oh, yeah. Of course, boss.

114
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,638
Cigar, cigarettes, Sen-Sen?

115
00:08:34,765 --> 00:08:36,933
I thought you were
at the Brown Derby ...

116
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,852
... with Trixie. No, Theresa.

117
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,562
- Margaret.
- Margaret. Exactly.

118
00:08:40,730 --> 00:08:42,856
What happened to Margaret?
She lost her --

119
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:44,566
Thank God that's settled.

120
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,861
Oh, I'm sorry.
Thelma, this is Howard Hughes.

121
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:52,032
Howard and I were discussing how he
wants me to pull a camera out of my ass.

122
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:56,661
- Cigarette?
- Oh, no, thanks. I don't smoke.

123
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,792
Boy, you are just hitting
on all six cylinders, aren't you?

124
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,836
My God.

125
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,630
Would you do me
a favor and just ...?

126
00:09:07,798 --> 00:09:10,467
Would you just smile
for me one time? Just once?

127
00:09:13,763 --> 00:09:16,389
Yeah. Yeah. You see,
you got a short upper lip.

128
00:09:16,766 --> 00:09:18,558
Makes for a much nicer smile.

129
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:27,317
See, I wonder what gives
a beautiful woman like you pleasure.

130
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:31,154
I mean, say you're just standing
there, right? And I just touch you.

131
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:33,323
Just -- Just like this.

132
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:35,325
With my fingertips.

133
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:37,702
Do you --?
Do you like that?

134
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:40,413
Do you?

135
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,463
You see, I wanna learn
what pleases you.

136
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:52,717
I wanna learn everything about you.

137
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,928
Would you let me do that?

138
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:57,305
Would you give me that job?

139
00:10:02,436 --> 00:10:04,395
I'm off in a half an hour.

140
00:10:06,107 --> 00:10:08,858
- Well, I'm in room --
- 217.

141
00:10:09,026 --> 00:10:10,944
217.

142
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,823
See you there.

143
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,663
Johnny, get on the horn
to Universal and Warners.

144
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,706
I need two more cameras
by Saturday.

145
00:10:23,874 --> 00:10:26,626
Rent them if you can.
Steal them if you have to.

146
00:10:27,378 --> 00:10:29,462
Absotively, boss.

147
00:10:29,922 --> 00:10:31,172
Absotively.

148
00:10:32,842 --> 00:10:35,593
Rumors coming from a lonely airstrip
out in Van Nuys.

149
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:39,055
Sources whisper that young
Texas industrialist Howard Hughes ...

150
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,641
... won't stop pouring money
into his war epic.

151
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:43,226
And do we mean epic!

152
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,229
One hundred and thirty-seven pilots,
87 airplanes ...

153
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:50,775
... 35 cameramen, 2000 extras.
How long will it be before this picture ...

154
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,194
... ends up costing as
much as the real war?

155
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:55,572
Damn it.
Why the hell do they look so slow?

156
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:59,367
This isn't what it was like up there.
They look like goddamn models!

157
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,169
Son of a bitch.

158
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:11,880
Howard?

159
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:18,344
Without something standing
still behind the planes ...

160
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:21,097
... we've got no idea
of how fast we're moving.

161
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,100
We got no sense of relative motion.

162
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:27,937
Call UCLA.
Get me the best meteorologist they got.

163
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,190
You get him here in an hour, all right?

164
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:36,362
Hey. You want the good news
or the bad news?

165
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,114
- Bad news, always.
- All right.

166
00:11:38,282 --> 00:11:41,451
We installed the 450 radial.
Struts won't take the vibration.

167
00:11:41,619 --> 00:11:45,455
Minute we fire her up, the struts
start cracking at the attach points.

168
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:48,416
- Well, what's the good news?
- There isn't any.

169
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,420
Goddamn it, Odie. If the 450's too big,
we figure something else out.

170
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:55,548
We've done everything.
We've rebuilt her from top to toe.

171
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,508
If we drain the fuel tank ...

172
00:11:57,676 --> 00:12:01,346
... she might make 180 miles per hour.
- I want minimum 200, all right?

173
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,390
I want a date with Theda Bara.
That ain't gonna happen.

174
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:06,476
Oh, don't be so sure.

175
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,688
If the struts won't sustain the engine
we need, we gotta get rid of the struts.

176
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,941
No, then the top wing falls off.

177
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:17,195
Then let it.

178
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,155
What?

179
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,492
Who says we need a top wing?

180
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,744
I mean, who says we need anything?

181
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,332
- A monoplane.
- A cantilevered monoplane, right?

182
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,710
They're doing it in France.
To hell with the top wing and struts.

183
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,296
- A 550 Wasp engine.
- One-hundred-octane fuel.

184
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,758
- That would give us a horsepower of what?
- Seven hundred.

185
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:44,430
We squeeze that to a thousand,
we got the fastest plane ever built.

186
00:12:47,226 --> 00:12:48,768
You know, I've gotta say ...

187
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:52,647
... we've already spent over $200,000
rebuilding this plane.

188
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,692
To hell with it.

189
00:12:56,819 --> 00:12:58,194
Tear it up, Odie.

190
00:12:58,362 --> 00:12:59,696
Go on.

191
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:04,701
Well ...

192
00:13:07,663 --> 00:13:11,374
The cumulonimbus formations
about which you speak ...

193
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,961
... that look like ...

194
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:16,921
Giant breasts full of milk.

195
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:18,840
I want clouds, damn it.

196
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,800
Yes, clouds ...

197
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:24,762
... that look like
giant breasts full of milk ...

198
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:28,474
... cannot exactly be guaranteed
for any particular occasion.

199
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:30,727
So you might have to ...

200
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,396
To wait.

201
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,442
Then we'll wait.

202
00:13:38,402 --> 00:13:40,737
Look, whatever they pay
you at UCLA ...

203
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:44,532
... I'm doubling it, all right?
You work for me now. Find some clouds.

204
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,368
Find some clouds.

205
00:13:48,037 --> 00:13:49,787
Find me some clouds!

206
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,165
Welcome to Hell's Angels.

207
00:13:55,377 --> 00:13:56,586
Thank you.

208
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:08,723
I've been to Chatsworth,
Santa Cruz, Encino, San Diego ...

209
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:12,769
... Riverside, Van Nuys and Bakersfield.
It has been eight months!

210
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,729
Where are my goddamn clouds, huh?

211
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:17,231
They move, Mr. Hughes!

212
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:18,733
Clouds move.

213
00:14:18,901 --> 00:14:21,361
- That's what they do. They move!
- You see that?

214
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,239
It is costing me $5,271 a day ...

215
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:29,786
... to keep those planes on the ground.
You find me some goddamn clouds, huh?

216
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,753
Nice day.

217
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,130
Yeah, very funny.

218
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:44,217
I got a call from Houston.
They're getting nervous.

219
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:46,302
Stop showing them the damn bills.

220
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,845
That would be illegal.

221
00:14:48,013 --> 00:14:50,264
Shit, no.
Maybe it's a little bit naughty.

222
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:54,310
Hughes Tool is incorporated in Texas.
They have to see the bills.

223
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:59,273
Incorporate a new division out here.
We'll call it Hughes Aircraft.

224
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:03,986
- Do we need these rivets on the cowling?
- Yeah, or the reverse thrust would rip it off.

225
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:06,864
They're gonna give me drag.
Do something about that.

226
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:09,325
- Wind resistance on rivets?
- I want her slippery.

227
00:15:09,493 --> 00:15:12,495
There are tax consequences
to incorporating in California.

228
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,164
- Just take care of it, would you?
- Mr. Hughes!

229
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,125
Oakland!

230
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:20,336
- We have clouds in Oakland!
- You mean it this time?

231
00:15:20,504 --> 00:15:22,046
Yes!

232
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:25,341
Goddamn it, yes.
I can promise you.

233
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:28,761
- Clouds in Oakland.
- All right, don't get all jittery now.

234
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:33,099
Oakland!

235
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:36,519
We're going to Oakland!
Oakland.

236
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,308
Down and to the left!

237
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,291
That's perfect!

238
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:48,591
That's right, Senator George.

239
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,427
Yes, young Howard Hughes
has pulled it off!

240
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:55,014
After two years, Hell's Angels
has finally finished filming.

241
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:58,309
There's gonna be one heck
of a wrap party in Hollywood tonight.

242
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,187
The price tag?
A staggering $2 million.

243
00:17:01,355 --> 00:17:03,856
If every human being
in America buys a ticket ...

244
00:17:04,024 --> 00:17:05,775
... he might even make a profit.

245
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,198
First, clouds don't come.

246
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:14,784
Then planes break down.
Then the planes crash.

247
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:19,497
We've had everything but
a plague of locusts on this thing.

248
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,040
I mean, you have to admit.

249
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:25,211
Now, honestly, did you ever think
you'd actually finish the damn thing?

250
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:28,798
Come with me.

251
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,970
Mama, darling,
if I'm a success in this show ...

252
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,222
... we're gonna move from here.
- Oh, no.

253
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,349
Yes.
We're gonna move up in the Bronx.

254
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:40,601
Green grass,
a lot of people you know.

255
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,479
The Ginsbergs,
the Guttenbergs and the Goldbergs.

256
00:17:43,647 --> 00:17:46,315
Oh, a whole lot of "bergs."
I don't know them all.

257
00:17:46,942 --> 00:17:50,695
See, this is what the people want.
Silent pictures are yesterday's news.

258
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,864
So I figure we gotta re-shoot
Hell's Angels for sound.

259
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,827
How much of it?

260
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:00,246
All of it.
Before you ask, I'll tell you.

261
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,291
An additional 1.7 million.
We got that much?

262
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,670
- No!
- Well, we'll make it.

263
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:09,589
Take care of that, would you?

264
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,090
Now, get this.

265
00:18:21,184 --> 00:18:23,352
In the halls of 7000 Romaine ...

266
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,938
... it goes on day after day,
month after month.

267
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:29,817
Howard Hughes is now editing
some 25 miles of film.

268
00:18:31,194 --> 00:18:35,823
Heck, I say release it now and give
the world its first 560-hour movie.

269
00:18:35,991 --> 00:18:40,244
Pat, Mr. Hughes needs this reel
in the projection room right now!

270
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,705
Enough is enough, Mr. Hughes.

271
00:18:42,873 --> 00:18:46,083
Are you ever gonna let us
actually see this epic of yours?

272
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:47,752
Hurry up!

273
00:19:08,732 --> 00:19:10,149
- Who is it?
- Noah.

274
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:11,984
Come on in.

275
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,155
I've been on the phone
to Houston for three hours.

276
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:19,325
- We're fixing every goddamn book we have.
- Wait, wait.

277
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:23,663
Yeah. Run reel 10 again.
I think we're duplicating a shot here.

278
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,667
And tell Jimmy I want
10 chocolate chip cookies, all right?

279
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,711
Medium chips,
none too close to the outside.

280
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:32,380
Got it?

281
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:34,882
You remember
that goddamn shot from reel 10?

282
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:37,635
No. I don't remember
anything from reel 10.

283
00:19:37,803 --> 00:19:39,970
I don't know what reel 10 is.

284
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:43,432
I'm a businessman, Howard.
And so are you.

285
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,393
Now, look.

286
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,019
This has been a great ride.

287
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:49,105
We've had a hell of a lot of fun.

288
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:53,192
But you're losing
$25,000 a day doing this.

289
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:55,403
Every day.

290
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:03,786
So, what are my options?

291
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:08,124
Well, this time I don't know
that you have any.

292
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,710
I'm afraid you gotta close it down.

293
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,087
Dig your way out.

294
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,762
I'm sorry, Howard.

295
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,140
I truly am.

296
00:20:31,481 --> 00:20:33,107
Reel 10, Mr. Hughes.

297
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,157
Mortgage Tool Co.

298
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:47,163
- Every asset. You heard me.
- If you do that, you could lose everything.

299
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:48,914
Well, I won't.

300
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,502
I won't.

301
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:56,797
All right.

302
00:20:58,008 --> 00:20:59,633
I'll get into it.

303
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:02,553
Thanks, Noah.

304
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:41,383
More than half a million souls lining
the curb of Hollywood Boulevard.

305
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,219
Look at the automobiles!

306
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:47,223
There are 45,000 cars here,
making it the greatest traffic jam ever seen.

307
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,809
Howard Hughes must have
a lump in his throat.

308
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:54,063
Six months after the stock market crashes
and after three pilots' deaths ...

309
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,233
... he's finally unveiling his
$4 million baby doll.

310
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:01,695
It's the most expensive movie ever made.
Nothing five-and-dime for our Mr. Hughes.

311
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:05,157
Nothing like tonight has ever been
seen before, and I can say ...

312
00:22:05,325 --> 00:22:06,992
... it will never be seen again.

313
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,163
Five hundred thousand people are crowding
the streets to get a glimpse of the stars.

314
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:14,041
Three companies of Marines
were called to assist ...

315
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:17,628
... the 250 special police who are
handling this enormous crowd --

316
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,338
This is an industry town.

317
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,424
And nobody but nobody
makes a movie outside a studio.

318
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:26,095
Some Hollywood insiders over
at the Brown Derby may be laughing ...

319
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:27,721
And now, I think ...

320
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,724
Yes, yes, I can see
Mr. Hughes' car arriving now.

321
00:22:30,892 --> 00:22:33,853
Mr. Hughes escorts
the lovely starlet Jean Harlow.

322
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,023
He discovered her for this picture,
and we think her platinum blond locks ...

323
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:42,444
... and hot-jazz, baby-doll style
are gonna make her a big star.

324
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,706
Howard! Howard!

325
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:02,131
Over here!

326
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,933
- This way, boss. Right over there.
- Mr. Hughes, how about a word?

327
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,603
Big night for you, Mr. Hughes.

328
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:20,149
Big night for you tonight.

329
00:23:20,317 --> 00:23:22,651
Very big. Very big.

330
00:23:22,819 --> 00:23:26,530
Tell us what it was like
making this fabulous picture.

331
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:30,159
Yes.

332
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:31,702
Yeah.

333
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,496
So 4 million clams
from your own pocket.

334
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:36,332
Nervous how the flick will fly?

335
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,172
Big night. You enjoy the show.

336
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:49,053
Yes, well, let me present the feminine
star of this spectacle, Hell's Angels ...

337
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,847
... Miss Jean Harlow.
- Thank you.

338
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,975
I would like to use this occasion
to thank Mr. Hughes ...

339
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:58,437
... for the opportunity he gave me.
Thank you.

340
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:01,982
Thank you!
Now I'd like to ask Roscoe Arbuckle ...

341
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:05,110
... to introduce
his pet lion cub, Gilmore.

342
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:07,947
What's the matter with you?
Can't remember my name?

343
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:12,117
I'm sorry. Roscoe Turner,
and this would be Gilmore.

344
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,912
It's going! It's going!

345
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:02,001
Murder! That's what this
dirty, rotten politician war is, murder!

346
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:03,627
You know it as well as I do.

347
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:43,000
Stand up, slim, take a bow.

348
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,849
Reel four played too long.
Too many coughs.

349
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,978
Get the team out of the party and
to the office. I wanna cut a few shots.

350
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,397
Oh, find Glenn.
Somebody write this down.

351
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,815
Flush rivets.
Got that?

352
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,650
- Flush rivets.
- Flush rivets.

353
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,360
Lickety-split, boss.

354
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:12,237
Here he is! Here he is!

355
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:16,200
Variety says, "This one won't miss!"

356
00:26:16,367 --> 00:26:19,661
- Magnificently photographed!
- Awesome beyond description!

357
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:23,415
The most extraordinary output
to emerge from a motion-picture studio.

358
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:26,502
Not for a long time have I seen
anything as enthralling.

359
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:29,713
It costs 4 million dollars
and has 4 million thrills!

360
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:32,174
- Majestically ...
- Most epic picture of its time!

361
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:30,607
A lighter shade. I don't want
to look like Boris Karloff.

362
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,401
If you know what I mean.

363
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,240
I read in the magazines
that you play golf.

364
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:40,075
On occasion.

365
00:27:40,243 --> 00:27:42,494
Well, how about nine holes?

366
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,748
Now, Mr. Hughes?

367
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,169
If it would be convenient, Miss Hepburn.

368
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:16,195
You're not extending
enough on your follow-through.

369
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:19,281
Follow-through
is everything in golf, just like life.

370
00:28:19,449 --> 00:28:20,782
Don't you find?

371
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:22,951
Saw your Scarface picture.

372
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,453
- Violent.
- Realistic.

373
00:28:24,621 --> 00:28:26,955
Movies are movies, Howard.
Not life.

374
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,790
Now the stage.

375
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:30,209
The stage is real.

376
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:34,379
Real flesh and blood. Human beings
right out there in front of you, buster.

377
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:37,507
Can't look away. Can't munch popcorn.
That would be rude.

378
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:38,967
Do you like the theater?

379
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,762
- No.
- Oh, I adore the theater.

380
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,097
Only alive on-stage.
I'll teach you.

381
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:48,185
We'll see some Ibsen. If the Republicans
haven't outlawed him by now.

382
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:51,396
You're not a Republican, are you?
How did you vote in '32?

383
00:28:51,564 --> 00:28:55,025
- Well, I didn't.
- You must! It's your sacred franchise.

384
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,657
Heard you were wooing Ginger Rogers.
What about that?

385
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,159
She's just a friend.

386
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,036
Men can't be friends with women.

387
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,288
They must possess them
or leave them be.

388
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,583
It's a primitive urge from caveman days.
It's all in Darwin.

389
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:17,089
Hunt the flesh, kill the flesh, eat the flesh.
That's the male sex all over.

390
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,132
Excuse me?

391
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:22,928
Well, if you're deaf,
you must own up to it.

392
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:25,138
Get a hearing aid.
Or see my father.

393
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,976
He's a urologist, but it's all tied up
inside the body, don't you find?

394
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,769
Me, I keep healthy.

395
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,063
I take seven showers a day
to keep clean.

396
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:36,566
Also because I am what's so
vulgarly referred to as "outdoorsy."

397
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:40,737
I'm not outdoorsy.
I'm athletic. I sweat.

398
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,699
There it is.
Now we both know the sordid truth.

399
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:46,326
I sweat and you're deaf.

400
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:49,371
Aren't we a fine pair of misfits?

401
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,793
Three.

402
00:30:02,343 --> 00:30:04,177
Noble effort.

403
00:30:06,556 --> 00:30:09,224
So I suppose you're
wooing me now?

404
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:11,893
Oh, well.

405
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:32,456
Not enough.

406
00:30:33,041 --> 00:30:36,084
Not enough.
These rivets have to be completely flush.

407
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,129
I want every screw and joint countersunk.

408
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,174
I want no wind resistance
on the fuselage.

409
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,634
She has got to be clean, Odie.

410
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,595
- Clean. Understand?
- Okay, Howard.

411
00:30:46,763 --> 00:30:48,555
I don't know
what else to tell you.

412
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,185
- What do you got for me?
- The thing is, TWA needs a new plane.

413
00:30:53,353 --> 00:30:55,979
- A modern plane.
- Oh, yeah? What kind of plane?

414
00:30:56,147 --> 00:30:58,398
Okay. The DC-3 has 21 daytime seats ...

415
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,984
... and 14 overnight berths.
- Something bigger?

416
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,696
Try 50 seats with
a ceiling of 12,000 feet.

417
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:07,115
No. No, 20,000.

418
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,618
Think about it.
What does 20,000 feet give you?

419
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:12,371
- Less turbulence.
- Because it's above the weather.

420
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,915
Jack, we wanna fly
above the weather.

421
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:18,627
Only 1 percent of the American population
has set foot on an airliner.

422
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:21,588
Why? Because they're scared to death.
They should be.

423
00:31:21,756 --> 00:31:24,341
I mean, 7000 feet is bumpy as shit.
You know that.

424
00:31:24,509 --> 00:31:27,010
We build a plane
that flies above the weather ...

425
00:31:27,178 --> 00:31:30,972
... we could get every man, woman
and child in this country to feel safe.

426
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:35,644
An airplane with the ability to fly into
the sub-stratosphere across the country.

427
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,646
Across the world.

428
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,898
Now that is the future.

429
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:41,566
- You with me?
- Yeah.

430
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,654
I don't wanna get into this
if your board doesn't have the balls for it.

431
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,156
- Would they support us?
- I don't know.

432
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,534
- What's your financial picture?
- Not great.

433
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,869
- Last year's deficit?
- 770,000.

434
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:55,747
- What's it selling at?
- About 8 dollars a share.

435
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:57,666
That's the lowest it's been, huh?

436
00:31:59,627 --> 00:32:01,086
I could do that.

437
00:32:01,254 --> 00:32:02,754
- Do what?
- Buy it.

438
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:05,590
- You wanna buy the airline?
- For crying out loud ...

439
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,678
... we don't want pencil pushers getting
in the way of us making our plane.

440
00:32:09,846 --> 00:32:13,682
Give me brass tacks, now. What does
controlling interest in TWA cost me?

441
00:32:14,684 --> 00:32:16,101
Call it 15 million.

442
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:20,689
That is a chunk of change, huh?

443
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,944
You call Noah Dietrich.

444
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,071
You have him start buying.

445
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,531
Howard, hold on.

446
00:32:29,699 --> 00:32:32,701
Are you sure?
You wanna think about it for five minutes?

447
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,705
Hell, Jack, I got a tiger by the tail here.
I ain't gonna let it go.

448
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,257
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

449
00:32:47,425 --> 00:32:49,801
Welcome. Your table is ready.

450
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,512
How goes the aviation?

451
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,640
- Oh, just fine, Pete.
- I'm so glad.

452
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,311
Good evening, Mr. Hughes.

453
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:00,729
- Madame.
- It's "miss."

454
00:33:00,897 --> 00:33:03,315
Miss. The usual, Mr. Hughes?

455
00:33:03,483 --> 00:33:05,609
- Please.
- May I recommend for the lady ...

456
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,279
... our clementine soup followed
by roast duck with currant glaze ...

457
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:12,407
... and poached pears in rose sauce.
It's truly divine.

458
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:14,075
Yeah. That sounds fine.

459
00:33:16,245 --> 00:33:18,997
Your kind of joint, is it?

460
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,708
Wouldn't have thought.

461
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,086
They're open late.
I go to a hot-dog stand on "La Cienega" too.

462
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:27,923
- They're open till about 4.
- Are they?

463
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:31,760
How marvelous.

464
00:33:47,610 --> 00:33:49,277
Howard! Howard!

465
00:33:50,238 --> 00:33:52,989
Hi! Son of a gun.

466
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,993
Kate, this is Johnny Meyer.
I suppose you could call him my press agent.

467
00:33:57,161 --> 00:33:59,454
- Pleased to meet you. Loved Alice Adams.
- You're too kind.

468
00:33:59,622 --> 00:34:02,290
- I'm sure you know Errol, right?
- Mr. Flynn. Yes.

469
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:07,337
Kate. Kate. Kate of the clenched-jawed
Hepburns. Enchanting as always.

470
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:10,215
You should use Lux on your hands,
by the way. I do.

471
00:34:10,383 --> 00:34:12,551
You and Howard
ought to cook up a picture.

472
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:15,262
Co-star with Errol.
I could sell that in spades.

473
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,639
That would be marvelous. Howard?

474
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:21,977
I think not.
Don't you read Variety, Mr. Meyer?

475
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,814
Well, I'm box-office poison.
I'm on the outs, the skids, the doldrums.

476
00:34:25,982 --> 00:34:29,359
Washed-up, day-old fish
not worth the eating, so they tell me.

477
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:33,363
Hell with them. Hell with them, my dear.
Soulless pricks to a man, right?

478
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:37,576
Johnny tells me you're thinking about
doing a Western, of all goddamn things.

479
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,416
Are you making a Western, Howard?

480
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:47,377
Yeah. Making a Western.
I'm gonna call it The Outlaw.

481
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:49,713
Yeah. And you know
what it's about? S-E-X.

482
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,591
- It's all about S-E-X.
- It's a Western.

483
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:55,677
You can't have fornication in a Western.
It isn't done.

484
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,637
It's not real sex, it's movie sex.

485
00:34:57,805 --> 00:35:01,474
What Scarface did for the gangster picture,
The Outlaw will do for the Western.

486
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:04,519
Put the sex and guts and blood
up there on the screen.

487
00:35:04,687 --> 00:35:06,688
- Have you seen my cigarettes?
- Don't mind us.

488
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:10,275
New York cut steak, 12 peas,
bottle of milk with the cap on.

489
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:13,695
- You can't afford your own cigarettes?
- Jack has all my money.

490
00:35:13,863 --> 00:35:18,158
I hope your food isn't getting cold
at your table somewhere or something.

491
00:35:18,326 --> 00:35:20,619
No, no. We're here all night.
Don't worry.

492
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:26,333
Now, Howard. Now, Howard. If you're
seriously talking about putting carnality ...

493
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,171
... back on the silver screen, you must swear
to let me in on the casting session.

494
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,179
- I have an eye for talent. Isn't that right?
- You ought to give up prancing in tights ...

495
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:42,932
... be a talent scout.
- That prancing paid for my new yacht.

496
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,561
You must all come sailing with me.
Catalina. What do you say?

497
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:49,898
- Catalina. Sounds grand. Yeah.
- I've even managed to coax ...

498
00:35:50,066 --> 00:35:53,943
... the luscious Miss De Havilland
and her equally luscious sister to come.

499
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:58,990
Though I fear their mother will insist on
coming, to preserve their questionable virtue.

500
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:03,370
We shall assault these twin monuments
of pristine Britannic beauty nonetheless.

501
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:05,580
- What do you say, Howard?
- Yeah?

502
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:08,166
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

503
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:13,755
I gotta go.

504
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:18,176
If you'll excuse us, we have --
We have to be somewhere.

505
00:36:18,511 --> 00:36:20,970
You are somewhere, Howard,
you madman.

506
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:24,182
- Somewhere else. Excuse us.
- Charmed, gentlemen.

507
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,977
Do help yourself to the poached pears.
I hear they're divine.

508
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:31,398
Well. Howard Hughes,
ladies and gentlemen.

509
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,608
Was that meant for me?

510
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:37,112
My hero. God, all that
Hollywood talk bores me silly.

511
00:36:37,279 --> 00:36:40,281
As if there aren't more important things,
like Mussolini.

512
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:44,369
- Where are we going, by the way?
- Do you feel like a little adventure?

513
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:46,454
Do your worst, Mr. Hughes.

514
00:36:46,622 --> 00:36:50,834
- Think you own this place, you limey bastard?
- I'm a Tasmanian bastard, you prick.

515
00:36:51,001 --> 00:36:53,420
- Thataway, Errol.
- Let me at him!

516
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,706
That's Mr. Mayer's house right there.

517
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:31,791
Do you know where Jack Warner lives?

518
00:37:41,051 --> 00:37:44,846
- What's that on the steering wheel?
- Cellophane.

519
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:48,892
If you had any idea of the crap
that people carry around on their hands.

520
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,060
What kind of crap?

521
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,438
You don't wanna know.

522
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:00,653
Hold on to the wheel for a bit.

523
00:38:08,704 --> 00:38:11,873
That's too hard. Relax your hand.
Relax your hand.

524
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:22,509
You see, you gotta feel the vibration
of the engine through your fingertips.

525
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,720
- Do you feel that?
- Yes.

526
00:38:28,349 --> 00:38:30,016
Well, that's good.

527
00:38:30,643 --> 00:38:32,352
Golly!

528
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:38,566
Well, she's all yours.

529
00:38:38,776 --> 00:38:42,445
- Where are you going?!
- I think there's some milk back here.

530
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,241
- You just keep us steady, now.
- All right.

531
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,095
- Howard.
- Yeah?

532
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:10,223
There's a rather alarming mountain
heading our way.

533
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,600
Pull back on the wheel a smidge.
Go on.

534
00:39:17,439 --> 00:39:20,024
Golly!

535
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:30,743
I don't think I've ever met someone
who actually uses the word "golly."

536
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,461
You all right?
Do you want me to take over?

537
00:39:40,629 --> 00:39:42,630
Just when I'm getting the hang of it?

538
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:51,681
- You want some milk?
- Oh, please.

539
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,830
Utterly smashing!
We'll do it again.

540
00:40:15,998 --> 00:40:19,167
I'm free Wednesday.
It's a little early for golf, though.

541
00:40:19,335 --> 00:40:21,628
Oh, no, no. I live right there.

542
00:40:22,129 --> 00:40:24,672
- Feel like a drink?
- Lead on.

543
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:29,093
Now, that makes
for a challenging par four.

544
00:40:29,345 --> 00:40:33,014
My decorator
picked out the wallpaper and such.

545
00:40:33,682 --> 00:40:35,725
He's queer as a bedbug.

546
00:40:35,893 --> 00:40:38,645
But I just hate this room.

547
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:40,772
Gives me the willies.

548
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:45,360
Like I'm about to be swallowed up
by the latest issue of Town & Country.

549
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:55,787
What room do you like?

550
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,539
My study.

551
00:41:00,918 --> 00:41:02,585
Take me there.

552
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:21,980
You are the tallest woman I know.

553
00:41:22,898 --> 00:41:27,026
And all sharp elbows and knees.
Beware.

554
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,593
Will you fly me to work tomorrow?

555
00:41:55,222 --> 00:41:57,432
It is tomorrow.

556
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,988
Keep your eye on the fuel. She's got
a minimum to keep her weight down.

557
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:57,158
Two runs. That's it.
After that, you're flying on vapors.

558
00:42:57,326 --> 00:43:00,119
And then you crash and you die.
Give her easy flying.

559
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,581
Don't worry about speed
and don't think about the record today.

560
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:07,210
I wish you'd let someone else take her.
You've got 20 test pilots.

561
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:11,714
Hell, why should I let someone else
have all the fun? See you in a bit.

562
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:34,445
Contact!

563
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:05,286
339.

564
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,290
Goddamn!

565
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,521
347.

566
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,274
Son of a bitch!

567
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:10,184
- 352.
- 352!

568
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:12,687
Good girl.

569
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:24,156
Damn it!

570
00:46:27,953 --> 00:46:30,079
Goddamn it!

571
00:46:30,539 --> 00:46:32,748
- Oh, God!
- There goes our meal ticket.

572
00:46:32,916 --> 00:46:34,417
Come on!

573
00:47:14,583 --> 00:47:16,000
Howard!

574
00:47:16,168 --> 00:47:18,336
- Howard!
- How did we do?

575
00:47:19,421 --> 00:47:21,756
352 on the last run.

576
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,176
She'll go faster.

577
00:47:25,761 --> 00:47:27,386
Country mouse!

578
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:31,557
- Kate! Katie!
- Upstairs, city mouse.

579
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:37,563
Hello.
Good Lord, what happened to you?

580
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:39,940
Oh, nothing. A hard landing.
I cut my foot.

581
00:47:40,108 --> 00:47:43,152
Sit down. I'll take care of it.
You tell me everything.

582
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:47,156
You cannot imagine what it was like, Katie.
You cannot imagine the speed.

583
00:47:47,324 --> 00:47:50,493
- She was like a winged bullet up there.
- What did she make?

584
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:54,830
Oh, around 352.

585
00:48:01,797 --> 00:48:03,297
You did it!

586
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:06,467
Fastest man on the planet.

587
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:09,887
Hot dog! I'm so proud of you.

588
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:12,056
- She did it, baby.
- You knew she would.

589
00:48:12,224 --> 00:48:15,184
Oh, she was fine. She was just fine.

590
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:17,978
Now let me see your foot.

591
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:19,480
Yeah.

592
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,776
- Good God! You're covered in blood.
- Oh, no. That's just beet juice.

593
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,112
- I crashed into a beet field.
- What?

594
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:28,489
Yeah, I crashed in a beet field.

595
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:33,786
Let me get you cleaned up.

596
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:39,333
- Heavens, what is this? Electrical tape?
- Yeah. Odie just sort of slammed it on there.

597
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:45,381
But all I could think about
was getting home to see you.

598
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:52,972
I am so proud of you.

599
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,854
Now, this is gonna sting a little bit.

600
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:03,858
Oh, this is useless.
Come to the bathroom.

601
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:07,945
- Don't get beet juice on the carpet.
- I won't, I won't.

602
00:49:08,113 --> 00:49:10,781
- Too hot!
- Don't be a baby.

603
00:49:12,451 --> 00:49:15,286
Was the press there?

604
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,496
Some.

605
00:49:17,706 --> 00:49:22,835
But they're calling everyone.
Should be on the wires by now.

606
00:49:31,428 --> 00:49:33,012
What is it?

607
00:49:35,724 --> 00:49:37,308
Kate?

608
00:49:40,562 --> 00:49:43,647
I've been famous,
for better or worse ...

609
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,150
... for a long time now ...

610
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,654
... and I wonder if you know what it ...

611
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,073
... really means.

612
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:57,369
Yeah. I had my fair share
of press on Hell's Angels.

613
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,914
I'm used to it.

614
00:50:01,875 --> 00:50:03,584
Are you?

615
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:09,006
Howard, we're ...

616
00:50:11,927 --> 00:50:14,386
We're not like everyone else.

617
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:21,310
Too many acute angles.
Too many eccentricities.

618
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:24,939
We have to be very careful not to ...

619
00:50:26,274 --> 00:50:30,110
... let people in,
or they'll make us into freaks.

620
00:50:31,279 --> 00:50:35,866
Kate, they can't get in here.
We're safe.

621
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,453
They can always get in.

622
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:45,042
When my brother killed himself ...

623
00:50:46,211 --> 00:50:48,796
... there were photographers
at the funeral.

624
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,258
There's no decency to it.

625
00:51:04,688 --> 00:51:06,772
You know, sometimes I ...

626
00:51:10,485 --> 00:51:12,653
I get these feelings, Katie.

627
00:51:17,659 --> 00:51:20,202
I get these ideas, these ...

628
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:25,666
... crazy ideas about ...

629
00:51:28,086 --> 00:51:30,462
... things that may not ...

630
00:51:31,715 --> 00:51:34,592
Things that may not really be there.

631
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,802
Yeah.

632
00:51:43,476 --> 00:51:46,228
Sometimes I truly fear that I'm ...

633
00:51:48,273 --> 00:51:50,232
... losing my mind.

634
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,700
And if I did, it would ...

635
00:52:02,787 --> 00:52:05,164
It'd be like flying blind.

636
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:14,965
You understand?

637
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:21,930
You taught me to fly, Howard.

638
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:26,894
I'll take the wheel.

639
00:52:42,827 --> 00:52:46,872
Smashing all records, Howard Hughes
outdoes Jules Verne's wildest dreams.

640
00:52:47,165 --> 00:52:50,417
Around the world from New York
to New York in four days.

641
00:52:50,585 --> 00:52:53,545
Even beating Wiley Post's mark
by over three days.

642
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:56,924
New aviation history is written
when his Lockheed monoplane ...

643
00:52:57,092 --> 00:53:00,094
... returns swiftly and safely.
A daring aviator.

644
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:03,222
A true pioneer of the world's airways.

645
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:07,393
From New York to Paris, he cuts Lindbergh's
time in half. Then on to Moscow.

646
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,106
Thirty-five hours out of New York,
he roars across Siberia's trackless wastes.

647
00:53:12,273 --> 00:53:16,944
Sixty hours out of New York, he heads
for Alaska, most hazardous hop of all.

648
00:53:17,112 --> 00:53:19,488
Continuing the terrific pace,
he comes home ...

649
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:21,990
... bringing new laurels
to American aviation.

650
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:26,620
Howard Hughes and his crew
may find more worlds to conquer --

651
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,965
You won't believe this. It just came over the
wires. Hughes has bought control of TWA.

652
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:43,595
I thought Mr. Hughes
was flying around the world.

653
00:53:43,805 --> 00:53:47,182
Apparently he did it while he was flying,
over the radio.

654
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:57,693
I have heard some disquieting rumors
about Mr. Hughes.

655
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:02,698
I'd like to know everything
there is to know about Mr. Hughes.

656
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,369
I'd like you to attend to that for me.

657
00:54:08,371 --> 00:54:09,997
Thoroughly.

658
00:54:10,582 --> 00:54:13,000
The Pantages is glittering tonight.

659
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:16,003
- Howard!
- Right over here. This way, over to the left.

660
00:54:16,171 --> 00:54:18,839
- Mr. Hughes, how was your flight?
- Miss Hepburn!

661
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,675
- When are you gonna name the day?
- Raise your head.

662
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:24,011
What's the next movie?
Give us the scoop.

663
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:26,847
Right here. How many more
records are you gonna set?

664
00:54:27,015 --> 00:54:30,350
Right over here. Come on.
Give us a smile. It won't kill you.

665
00:54:30,518 --> 00:54:32,394
- Howard, this way.
- Beautiful.

666
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:35,063
Over here, over here, Mr. Hughes.

667
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,691
When are you gonna fly
around the world again?

668
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:41,862
You gonna fly with Kate next time?
Did you get lonely without her?

669
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:46,074
- Talk to Lindbergh about your flight yet?
- Where's Linda Darnell tonight?

670
00:54:46,242 --> 00:54:49,536
- Please, Mr. Hughes.
- Right here. Right here, Mr. Hughes.

671
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:52,206
Are you trying to be more famous
than Lindbergh?

672
00:54:52,916 --> 00:54:56,668
You know,
fame is supposed to be my turf.

673
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,547
L.B.!

674
00:55:03,176 --> 00:55:06,553
If you don't get more distinguished
every time I see you.

675
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:08,722
You look so beautiful.

676
00:55:16,523 --> 00:55:18,148
Is that true?

677
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:28,826
Don't worry about it, Howard.

678
00:55:28,993 --> 00:55:32,663
She's just working the room.
It's her job, baby.

679
00:55:35,708 --> 00:55:39,503
Sultry Southern tigress Ava Gardner
dazzles the room tonight.

680
00:55:39,671 --> 00:55:41,922
She's the newest star
in the MGM galaxy.

681
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:45,717
And believe you me,
she puts the "cheese" in "cheesecake."

682
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:53,475
Well, Jane Eyre has been selling popcorn
for over a hundred years, L.B.

683
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:38,854
Hello.

684
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:46,945
Could you reach me a towel?

685
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:56,121
I ...

686
00:56:57,248 --> 00:57:00,500
I really can't do that.

687
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,670
I'm sorry.

688
00:57:28,488 --> 00:57:32,824
I'm an idiot. I'm a complete idiot,
and I'm sorry.

689
00:57:33,159 --> 00:57:36,745
- Forget it.
- No, no. I'm a vain, preening ass ...

690
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:41,917
... without a single redeeming feature.
- That's not true. You have very good teeth.

691
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,877
Come on.

692
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:49,091
I've got a better idea. Take me flying.
Or better yet, I'll take you flying.

693
00:57:49,258 --> 00:57:51,009
Do your worst, Miss Hepburn.

694
00:58:00,103 --> 00:58:03,939
Don't be so squirmy. You're gonna
get on famously with Father and Mother.

695
00:58:04,107 --> 00:58:07,734
And I'm sure they'll like you too.
Once they get to know you.

696
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,870
- Hello! Hello!
- Kath, hello.

697
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:20,580
Kathy.

698
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:27,254
- Who's that with the camera right there?
- That's my ex-husband, Ludlow.

699
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:29,715
Father and Mother are just mad
about Luddie.

700
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:34,219
- What the hell's he doing here?
- Oh, he's here all the time.

701
00:58:35,096 --> 00:58:36,763
Hello!

702
00:58:38,266 --> 00:58:39,725
Sorry we're late.

703
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:42,185
- Mom.
- Oh. Oh, thank you.

704
00:58:42,353 --> 00:58:43,979
- Dad.
- Darling.

705
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:47,441
- Uncle Willy.
- Oh, who have we got here?

706
00:58:47,608 --> 00:58:50,360
- Don't feel self-conscious.
- Hepburns! Hepburns!

707
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:54,281
Attention, please. This is Howard.

708
00:58:54,574 --> 00:58:56,408
Howard, welcome.

709
00:58:57,744 --> 00:58:59,828
Don't worry, he's had his lunch.

710
00:59:01,456 --> 00:59:03,331
He likes you. That's unusual.

711
00:59:03,499 --> 00:59:06,835
We pay our devotion to the arts here.
A colony we created.

712
00:59:07,003 --> 00:59:10,964
Julian's a painter. Abstract, of course.
What's the point of painting ...

713
00:59:11,132 --> 00:59:14,509
... something real when you can just
take a picture nowadays?

714
00:59:14,677 --> 00:59:17,137
Where do you stand on politics,
Mr. Hughes?

715
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:20,140
- Excuse me?
- We're all socialists here.

716
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:21,725
We are not.

717
00:59:22,977 --> 00:59:25,562
You've met Mr. Roosevelt.
What make you of him?

718
00:59:28,775 --> 00:59:30,817
What are you sniggering at?

719
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:33,320
- What? What was that?
- You just sniggered.

720
00:59:34,113 --> 00:59:37,115
No, no. The dog.
It seems to be crushing my feet.

721
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,242
- Oh, my God!
- Buster!

722
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:40,660
Hey. Hey!

723
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:43,789
Don't you like dogs?

724
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:46,625
I will not have you sniggering
at Mr. Roosevelt.

725
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:48,502
- Please leave.
- No. I wasn't.

726
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:51,671
- I thought everybody liked dogs.
- Perhaps he had a bad experience.

727
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:54,299
Does it upset you
that Howard gets more press?

728
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,636
- A bad experience with a dog?
- No, no.

729
00:59:57,804 --> 01:00:02,349
- You are such a shy creature, aren't you?
- Perhaps it was a very large dog.

730
01:00:02,517 --> 01:00:06,311
- The press can be a damned nuisance.
- Was it a Doberman?

731
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:09,564
- A Doberman, Mr. Hughes? Or a dachshund?
- Neither, sir.

732
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:13,985
- Dachshunds are little dogs, Hep dear.
- They should all be lined up and shot.

733
01:00:14,153 --> 01:00:17,364
- What's that Spanish painting?
- The Goya.

734
01:00:17,532 --> 01:00:19,699
Goya. Of course. Yes.

735
01:00:20,368 --> 01:00:23,537
- Yes, Mexican.
- What was that called?

736
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:27,833
Anyway, that's the vulgar press, I'm sure.
Do you read much, Mr. Hughes?

737
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:32,295
I try to stay up to snuff
on the trade journals, yeah.

738
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:36,341
- Snuff?
- These would be flying magazines?

739
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:40,387
- What was that?
- Oh, he's a little deaf.

740
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:43,890
- Pass the goddamn butter, I beg you.
- You read flying magazines?

741
01:00:44,058 --> 01:00:47,144
Trade journals. On engineering. Aviation.

742
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:49,062
We read books.

743
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:53,733
Howard has to read the trade pieces, Mom,
because he's designing a new aeroplane.

744
01:00:53,901 --> 01:00:55,902
Oh, really? Do tell.

745
01:00:59,115 --> 01:01:00,657
Well ...

746
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:07,080
... it's quite exciting, actually.
It's a spy plane for the Air Corps.

747
01:01:07,248 --> 01:01:09,374
A twin-engine plane with some ...

748
01:01:09,542 --> 01:01:12,544
... I must admit,
some rather unique design features.

749
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:15,255
You see,
it has these two booms at the back --

750
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:18,508
Luddie built a birdhouse once.
You remember that, dear?

751
01:01:18,759 --> 01:01:21,970
- Yes, well, a mere trifle, darling.
- I remember the painting!

752
01:01:22,138 --> 01:01:24,806
The painting, it's called
May 18-0-something.

753
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:27,851
Anyway, Goya's vastly overrated.
All the Spaniards are.

754
01:01:28,019 --> 01:01:30,729
- Nonsense! Picasso is sacred.
- I'm a urologist.

755
01:01:30,897 --> 01:01:33,773
- I' was quite aesthetic, really.
- A sacred monster.

756
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:36,610
The birds don't care for it much,
but the bats do.

757
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:38,945
- I'll bet.
- That's such bunk!

758
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:42,407
- Do speak up, dear.
- Nothing, nothing, Mrs. Hepburn. Nothing.

759
01:01:42,575 --> 01:01:46,453
Why did you speak? I can't abide people
who speak but have nothing to say.

760
01:01:46,621 --> 01:01:50,290
Did you go to mechanic school
to learn all this airplane guff?

761
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,000
No, no, I didn't, Luddie. No.

762
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:54,961
Well, Howard just flew round
the world in three days.

763
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:58,048
- I think we've had enough about airplanes.
- And dogs.

764
01:01:58,216 --> 01:02:01,968
- Then how did you make all that money?
- We don't care about money here.

765
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:04,095
Well, that's because you have it.

766
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:09,434
Would you repeat that?

767
01:02:10,770 --> 01:02:13,688
You don't care about money
because you've always had it.

768
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:16,816
- How did you make all that --?
- Excuse me, I'm speaking.

769
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,235
- Okay.
- Thank you.

770
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,861
All right.

771
01:02:20,321 --> 01:02:22,739
Some of us choose to work for a living.

772
01:02:22,907 --> 01:02:28,161
Speaking of which, I have more of that
airplane guff to attend to.

773
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,664
Excuse me.

774
01:02:38,256 --> 01:02:40,924
Well, seems a rather high-strung chap.

775
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:44,344
You're a fine bunch of bullies,
aren't you?

776
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:47,847
Have you talked to Mr. Mayer
about letting you do Jane Eyre?

777
01:02:48,015 --> 01:02:51,309
The old philistine won't budge.
Too arty, don't you know.

778
01:02:51,477 --> 01:02:56,398
I'm convinced the man hasn't read anything
longer than a Katzenjammer Kids in his life.

779
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:01,236
No fair, kicking.
You have to use the mallet.

780
01:03:03,030 --> 01:03:06,783
Really, darling, you can't retire
from the field of battle like that ...

781
01:03:06,951 --> 01:03:10,412
... or they'll never respect you.
- Katie, I don't understand.

782
01:03:10,746 --> 01:03:13,206
You're like a different person in there.

783
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,793
They just expect me to be a certain way.

784
01:03:18,713 --> 01:03:23,008
There's only one real Kate,
and that's your Kate.

785
01:03:26,470 --> 01:03:31,182
Over in Hollywood, aviation tycoon
Howard Hughes is cooking up something big.

786
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:35,854
Even as he edits his new picture, he's been
secretly meeting with the U.S. Air Corps.

787
01:03:36,022 --> 01:03:39,566
We applaud his patriotism and look forward
to his newest marvel.

788
01:03:39,734 --> 01:03:43,153
You know how many Allied ships we lost
because of U-boat attacks?

789
01:03:43,321 --> 01:03:45,447
- No.
- Six hundred and eighty-one ships ...

790
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:50,243
... just this year so far. The Army needs
a new airplane to fly the troops to Europe.

791
01:03:50,411 --> 01:03:53,913
These ships, they're sitting ducks
for the U-boats.

792
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:57,751
- You wanna build a troop-carrier plane?
- Stop thinking like an insect.

793
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,837
Not just to carry troops,
a plane to carry everything.

794
01:04:01,005 --> 01:04:05,258
The troops and the jeeps and the tanks
and whatnot. Here, take a look.

795
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:08,511
No. Other side.

796
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:14,976
I figure around 200 feet from nose to tail.
Wingspan, around 300.

797
01:04:15,144 --> 01:04:17,729
We're gonna need
about 24,000 horsepower.

798
01:04:19,023 --> 01:04:22,108
Now, this is just what Kaiser
and the Army are looking for.

799
01:04:22,276 --> 01:04:25,779
- They're gonna pay for it this time.
- What are you getting us into?

800
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:28,823
Well, it's a big plane,
so I'm calling it The Hercules.

801
01:04:29,325 --> 01:04:30,867
Swell name, isn't it?

802
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:34,454
- How heavy you imagine this thing is?
- Say around 200 tons.

803
01:04:37,625 --> 01:04:40,126
Well, I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

804
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:43,713
All right, boys,
I want you to rig up something like this.

805
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:48,343
Should give the proper uplift ratios and
reduce need for torque support on the front.

806
01:04:48,511 --> 01:04:52,263
We are not getting enough production
out of Jane Russell's breasts.

807
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:54,974
I want smooth titties, gentlemen.
Smooth titties.

808
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:00,939
- It's all in engineering, isn't it, Odie?
- Howard ...

809
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:06,069
... do you really think they're gonna let you
put out a whole movie just about tits?

810
01:05:06,278 --> 01:05:09,155
Sure. Who doesn't like tits?

811
01:05:19,542 --> 01:05:22,836
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
Sorry I'm late.

812
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:27,507
Please record that Mr. Hughes has arrived
and this session is now called to order.

813
01:05:27,675 --> 01:05:30,468
- I yield the floor to Mr. Breen.
- Mr. Hughes ...

814
01:05:30,636 --> 01:05:34,514
... members of the committee, I've reviewed
the photoplay entitled The Outlaw ...

815
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:38,435
... and I can state that I have never seen
anything so unacceptable ...

816
01:05:38,602 --> 01:05:42,522
... as the shots of the mammaries
of the character named Rio.

817
01:05:42,898 --> 01:05:47,026
For almost half the picture,
the girl's mammaries, which are quite large ...

818
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:50,363
... and prominent,
are shockingly uncovered.

819
01:05:51,323 --> 01:05:55,577
For this reason, I concluded the picture
appeals only to prurient interests ...

820
01:05:55,744 --> 01:06:00,290
... and should be denied the Motion Picture
Association's seal of approval.

821
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:03,168
Really, Mr. Hughes.

822
01:06:03,335 --> 01:06:06,963
- Thank you, Mr. Breen. Mr. Hughes.
- Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

823
01:06:07,298 --> 01:06:09,466
Mr. Breen. It's good to see you again.

824
01:06:09,633 --> 01:06:13,761
I haven't seen you all since that situation
with all the violence in Scarface.

825
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:17,098
The situation here revolves
around Miss Russell's mammaries.

826
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,851
Mr. Breen feels that they are
too prominent, yes?

827
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:23,396
More prominent than other mammaries
have been up on the screen?

828
01:06:23,564 --> 01:06:26,191
Well, I hope to dispel that notion.

829
01:06:29,695 --> 01:06:31,112
Jean Harlow.

830
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:34,699
Ann Sheridan.

831
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:37,577
Irene Dunne.

832
01:06:37,745 --> 01:06:39,370
Claudette Colbert.

833
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:41,664
Rita Hayworth.

834
01:06:42,082 --> 01:06:46,419
Betty Grable.
And the lovely Miss Jane Russell.

835
01:06:46,587 --> 01:06:50,924
Now, all these shots, save for Miss Russell,
were enlarged from pictures ...

836
01:06:51,091 --> 01:06:54,385
... that received
Mr. Breen's seal of approval.

837
01:06:55,012 --> 01:07:00,099
Now, as you've probably noticed by now,
they all contain mammaries.

838
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:04,103
I will ask my associate to join me now.
May I introduce ...

839
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:07,982
... Dr. Ludlow Branson
of Columbia University.

840
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:11,277
Dr. Branson ...

841
01:07:11,904 --> 01:07:15,365
... is a mathematician of some note.

842
01:07:15,533 --> 01:07:18,034
Yes. And he will now demonstrate ...

843
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:19,953
... that in fact ...

844
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:23,623
... Miss Russell's mammaries
are no more prominent ...

845
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,626
... than any of these other fine ladies'.

846
01:07:29,129 --> 01:07:30,421
Doctor.

847
01:07:31,924 --> 01:07:33,508
Doctor ...

848
01:07:34,385 --> 01:07:36,636
... you forgot your calipers.

849
01:07:43,435 --> 01:07:46,646
Gentlemen, Mr. Hughes.

850
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:51,943
Let us commence by calling this ...

851
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:55,071
... Mammary Exhibit Number One.

852
01:07:55,239 --> 01:08:00,994
Now, you'll see that the length
of the actual cleavage ...

853
01:08:01,745 --> 01:08:04,956
... if I may, is ...

854
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,167
... 5 inches and a quarter.

855
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:09,919
Now if we move to Mammary Exhibit ...

856
01:08:10,087 --> 01:08:11,546
Dateline: Hollywoodland.

857
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:15,216
Movie tycoon Howard Hughes
must have the greatest job in the land.

858
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:18,845
Every night, the lucky guy escorts
a different beautiful woman ...

859
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,930
... to a different dazzling event.

860
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:25,768
The TWA king always talks up
his airline as he escorts a succession ...

861
01:08:28,063 --> 01:08:30,189
The Hercules, ladies and gentlemen.

862
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:31,858
The Hercules.

863
01:08:32,026 --> 01:08:35,945
A plane, a boat, a flying city.

864
01:08:36,113 --> 01:08:39,574
Don't forget, every bill comes to me.
They don't pay for anything.

865
01:08:39,742 --> 01:08:43,202
Those men decide whether to fund
the plane, so I need them happy.

866
01:08:43,537 --> 01:08:45,830
- You do what it takes.
- You betcha, boss.

867
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:48,541
How are the girls
in the bomb department?

868
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:52,545
Well, let's put it this way,
it'll be a regular boob buffet.

869
01:08:52,713 --> 01:08:55,798
I don't think the Air Corps men
will have trouble scoring.

870
01:08:55,966 --> 01:08:59,636
- Good.
- And inside, 700 brave American soldiers ...

871
01:08:59,803 --> 01:09:04,307
... a dozen Sherman tanks all winging
their way over the Atlantic ...

872
01:09:04,475 --> 01:09:06,893
... free from the threats
of the U-boats below.

873
01:09:07,061 --> 01:09:11,397
Could Jules Verne himself have
ever imagined anything so magnificent?

874
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:15,526
Could he have imagined her mammoth
wingspan, longer than a football field?

875
01:09:15,778 --> 01:09:17,528
Don't you see how this demeans me?

876
01:09:17,696 --> 01:09:20,031
Since when do you care
about scandal rags?

877
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:23,493
Every time there's a picture of you with
another woman, it's a slap in the face.

878
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:26,621
- Don't you understand that?
- Well, that's overstating it.

879
01:09:26,789 --> 01:09:30,124
Joan Crawford, Ginger Rogers,
Linda Darnell, Joan Fontaine ...

880
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:33,211
... and now Bette Davis,
for God's sake.

881
01:09:35,089 --> 01:09:40,259
Look, they're Cracker Jack candy, honey.
They don't mean anything to me.

882
01:09:40,427 --> 01:09:43,388
Oh, very nice.

883
01:09:45,057 --> 01:09:47,934
You're the one that said
that all men are predators.

884
01:09:48,102 --> 01:09:51,020
I mean, it's all in Darwin, remember?

885
01:09:51,355 --> 01:09:54,941
And am I to expect this behavior
to continue after the wedding?

886
01:09:55,109 --> 01:09:57,193
What is really bothering you, Kate?

887
01:09:57,361 --> 01:10:00,613
Is it the women or the publicity?

888
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:10,123
Can't you eat ice cream from a bowl
like everyone else in the world?

889
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:20,800
Don't you dare.

890
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:33,730
Yeah.

891
01:10:34,898 --> 01:10:38,484
No, Odie, this is not a good time.

892
01:10:38,736 --> 01:10:42,905
For chrissakes, we can't make The Hercules
if we don't have any aluminum.

893
01:10:43,073 --> 01:10:44,657
Wait.

894
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,910
I can hear you better now.
Tell the War Production Board ...

895
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:51,289
... that this is an essential
strategic operation.

896
01:10:51,457 --> 01:10:56,002
If they're giving aluminum to Boeing,
they can give some to Hughes Aircraft.

897
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:59,172
Don't set the ice cream --

898
01:10:59,339 --> 01:11:03,676
We gotta think of something else. If we
can't get aluminum, we'll find another way.

899
01:11:04,136 --> 01:11:07,472
You tell me. We'll find
some alloy that works just as well.

900
01:11:07,723 --> 01:11:10,349
Right. Look ...

901
01:11:10,517 --> 01:11:14,687
- If we can't get aluminum, we'll use wood.
- You can't make a plane out of wood.

902
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:17,356
Why not?
The damn thing is a flying boat, right?

903
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,525
- What do they use to make boats?
- Oak.

904
01:11:19,693 --> 01:11:22,612
And think of The Hercules
like a flying Spanish galleon.

905
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:25,573
Spanish galleons
can weigh 1,200 tons.

906
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,284
Good luck today.

907
01:11:28,827 --> 01:11:32,163
We just have to find the right wood.
Something light but strong.

908
01:11:32,331 --> 01:11:35,124
- Morning, Kate.
- Pine, cedar, maybe birch.

909
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:47,220
Catch.

910
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:52,934
From my farm.

911
01:11:53,519 --> 01:11:56,103
If you like it, I can get you a bushel.

912
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:11,369
Trouble with Mr. Hughes?

913
01:12:16,750 --> 01:12:21,212
There's too much Howard Hughes
in Howard Hughes.

914
01:12:23,048 --> 01:12:25,091
That's the trouble.

915
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,022
Beautiful.

916
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:43,401
Don't you take Christmas off?

917
01:12:44,736 --> 01:12:47,488
Nice to see you.
Sorry, I've got grease on my hands.

918
01:12:47,656 --> 01:12:50,199
Have we got something to show you.

919
01:12:54,580 --> 01:12:59,292
Take a look. The XF-11
reconnaissance flier. Spy plane, really.

920
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:02,962
Designed every inch of her myself.

921
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:05,131
She's got a top speed of 450 ...

922
01:13:05,299 --> 01:13:08,134
... which means she can outrun
anything they throw against her.

923
01:13:08,302 --> 01:13:11,387
After the Japs stole
my H-1 design for their Zeros ...

924
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:13,723
... I needed to do them one better.

925
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:17,977
Yeah, she's my Buck Rogers ship.

926
01:13:18,145 --> 01:13:20,146
She's a looker.

927
01:13:20,814 --> 01:13:22,440
Okay, what do you got for me?

928
01:13:29,865 --> 01:13:32,116
Jiminy Cricket.

929
01:13:32,284 --> 01:13:35,953
Seating capacity for 60.
Wingspan, 123 feet.

930
01:13:36,121 --> 01:13:39,498
Four Double Cyclone engines.
Her ceiling's 25,000 feet.

931
01:13:39,666 --> 01:13:42,877
- Gross weight?
- 86,000, wing loading of 41 pounds.

932
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:45,838
So less drag on the plane in thinner air.

933
01:13:46,006 --> 01:13:49,508
So high-cruise power, you're looking
at a top speed of around 340.

934
01:13:50,552 --> 01:13:54,138
Giving her a range of about 3000 miles.

935
01:13:55,307 --> 01:13:57,808
- Cross-country.
- Non-stop.

936
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,686
Bob ...

937
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:04,023
... you know something?
You are a son of a bitch.

938
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:18,454
Yeah. Bob, you got
something on your suit.

939
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,499
Yeah.

940
01:14:21,875 --> 01:14:24,377
On your lapel.
You got something on your lapel.

941
01:14:27,506 --> 01:14:29,382
Right there, Bob.

942
01:14:31,134 --> 01:14:32,718
You missed it. Right there.

943
01:14:35,013 --> 01:14:36,889
Clean it off, would you?

944
01:14:37,057 --> 01:14:39,558
Here. Thanks.

945
01:14:42,813 --> 01:14:44,230
No, throw it away.

946
01:14:48,276 --> 01:14:49,694
No, over there.

947
01:14:56,201 --> 01:15:00,037
Thanks. So, what do you call her?

948
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:02,373
The Constellation,
but we can change that.

949
01:15:02,541 --> 01:15:04,166
No, no.

950
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:07,378
It's pretty. I like her.

951
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:10,423
So, what kind of deal can you give me?

952
01:15:10,590 --> 01:15:12,425
What kind of deal can you give me?

953
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:14,885
The first 40 planes off the assembly line.

954
01:15:15,053 --> 01:15:17,596
That should give us about
two years' exclusivity.

955
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:19,056
Hell, more than that.

956
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:23,227
United and American don't have
the imagination for a plane like this.

957
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,980
Two years ahead of Juan Trippe, then.

958
01:15:31,028 --> 01:15:32,278
How much?

959
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:34,613
Four hundred and fifty thousand each.

960
01:15:35,449 --> 01:15:38,284
So that's 18 million for the first 40.

961
01:15:39,244 --> 01:15:42,288
Hell, TWA can't afford that.
The damn airline's flat broke.

962
01:15:46,460 --> 01:15:48,961
Guess I'll just have
to pay for them myself.

963
01:15:49,838 --> 01:15:52,923
Build them, Bob.
Send the bill to Noah Dietrich.

964
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:54,633
Oh, and thank you.

965
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,222
Merry Christmas.

966
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:04,852
You've just placed the largest order for
airplanes in the history of the damn planet.

967
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,146
Lockheed sent us a bill for $18 million.

968
01:16:07,314 --> 01:16:10,608
Don't get all hysterical on me, Noah.
It isn't good for you.

969
01:16:10,776 --> 01:16:14,111
- This is a lot of money for planes.
- I know it's a lot of money.

970
01:16:14,279 --> 01:16:17,907
It's too damn much. You think I've got
$18 million in petty cash?

971
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:20,242
I should've told you. It slipped my mind.

972
01:16:20,410 --> 01:16:22,328
- Slipped your mind? Oh, for --
- Right.

973
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:25,956
- I'll get back to you. Bye.
- How could $18 million slip your mind?

974
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:30,002
Hey, honey.
What are you doing home?

975
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,259
You're not one for tears, and, well ...

976
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:41,680
... neither am l,
so it's best to come out with it.

977
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,021
I've met someone.
I've fallen in love and I'm moving out.

978
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:56,403
If I could make it
any more gentle, I would.

979
01:16:56,571 --> 01:17:00,658
But I can't, so ...

980
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:03,577
... there we both are.

981
01:17:07,207 --> 01:17:09,041
Let's be honest.

982
01:17:09,209 --> 01:17:13,712
It's all been a grand adventure,
but it couldn't possibly last.

983
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:16,757
We're too alike, you and I.

984
01:17:19,886 --> 01:17:21,220
You met someone?

985
01:17:21,388 --> 01:17:25,307
Someone more appropriate.
To me, I mean.

986
01:17:28,019 --> 01:17:30,980
What does that mean,
"more appropriate"?

987
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:35,484
Someone more attuned to my needs.

988
01:17:36,027 --> 01:17:37,945
Look at me, Katie.

989
01:17:38,113 --> 01:17:40,030
Stop acting.

990
01:17:40,448 --> 01:17:43,242
I'm not acting.

991
01:17:47,873 --> 01:17:50,499
I wonder if you even know anymore.

992
01:17:55,422 --> 01:17:57,631
Don't be unkind.

993
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:02,052
You ...?

994
01:18:03,388 --> 01:18:04,722
You wanna go?

995
01:18:08,351 --> 01:18:09,977
Go on.

996
01:18:10,562 --> 01:18:13,689
Actresses are cheap in this town, darling.

997
01:18:13,857 --> 01:18:16,442
- And I got a lot of money.
- This is beneath you.

998
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:19,069
No, no, this is exactly me.

999
01:18:19,237 --> 01:18:24,366
You tell me you're leaving me, and you
have the nerve to expect graciousness?

1000
01:18:24,826 --> 01:18:26,827
I expect a little maturity.

1001
01:18:26,995 --> 01:18:29,914
I expect you to face the situation
like an adult who --

1002
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,374
Don't talk down to me!

1003
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:35,544
Don't you ever talk down to me!
You are a movie star.

1004
01:18:35,712 --> 01:18:37,296
Nothing more.

1005
01:19:49,327 --> 01:19:51,245
Don't answer it.

1006
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:55,833
What is it, Howard?

1007
01:19:56,001 --> 01:19:58,294
Hey, Noah ...

1008
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:01,463
... I need you to get to Penney's
and buy me some clothes.

1009
01:20:01,631 --> 01:20:03,424
- Penney's isn't open.
- Oh, shit.

1010
01:20:03,591 --> 01:20:06,552
- It's 2 in the morning.
- Yeah, that's right.

1011
01:20:06,720 --> 01:20:09,430
Well, first thing tomorrow, then, all right?

1012
01:20:09,597 --> 01:20:12,683
I need two new suits off the rack.
One light and one dark.

1013
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:16,061
Three white shirts and three pairs
of white tennis shoes. Got that?

1014
01:20:16,229 --> 01:20:18,188
- Yeah.
- No, no.

1015
01:20:18,356 --> 01:20:20,190
- Make it Woolworth's.
- Woolworth's.

1016
01:20:20,358 --> 01:20:22,943
No, no, Penney's. Penney's.

1017
01:20:23,111 --> 01:20:24,862
All right.

1018
01:20:25,572 --> 01:20:28,365
I'll get into it as soon as I can, Howard.

1019
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,243
- All right?
- Noah, do you have a recorder?

1020
01:20:31,953 --> 01:20:35,164
- No.
- Are you recording this conversation?

1021
01:20:35,332 --> 01:20:37,750
- No.
- Okay.

1022
01:20:37,917 --> 01:20:39,752
I trust you.

1023
01:20:40,754 --> 01:20:44,131
- Howard --
- I need those suits first thing tomorrow.

1024
01:20:44,299 --> 01:20:47,760
- All right.
- Wait. Did I say Penney's or Woolworth's?

1025
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:50,596
- Penney's.
- Better make it Sears.

1026
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:53,265
All right, then, Sears.

1027
01:20:56,102 --> 01:20:58,270
I'm sorry, honey.

1028
01:20:59,481 --> 01:21:01,774
If I don't answer, he'll just call back.

1029
01:21:23,630 --> 01:21:26,673
Stop there, if you please, Miss Domergue.

1030
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,473
Have you had surgery, Miss Domergue?

1031
01:21:36,309 --> 01:21:37,810
No.

1032
01:21:38,645 --> 01:21:41,730
Do you have scars of any kind?

1033
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:44,650
No.

1034
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:48,445
Wipe off your lipstick.

1035
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:54,284
That's much better.

1036
01:21:55,870 --> 01:22:00,791
Now, you understand that you'd be
under contract to me? Personally.

1037
01:22:01,709 --> 01:22:03,335
Do you know what that means?

1038
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:13,971
Now turn around for me.

1039
01:22:22,230 --> 01:22:23,730
Very nice.

1040
01:22:24,858 --> 01:22:26,733
You move well.

1041
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:31,530
You live with your family, do you?

1042
01:22:33,658 --> 01:22:35,242
Yes.

1043
01:22:35,702 --> 01:22:37,244
That's nice.

1044
01:22:38,580 --> 01:22:40,372
Tell me something.

1045
01:22:41,708 --> 01:22:44,126
How old are you, Miss Domergue?

1046
01:22:47,088 --> 01:22:48,881
Fifteen.

1047
01:22:52,260 --> 01:22:53,427
Holy Mother of God.

1048
01:23:12,864 --> 01:23:16,658
Well, a car picks me up
every morning at 8, and off I go.

1049
01:23:16,826 --> 01:23:19,870
I'm getting my high school diploma.

1050
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:22,748
Howard thinks that education is important.

1051
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:25,292
- That's right.
- And then, after classes ...

1052
01:23:25,460 --> 01:23:29,046
... I'm off for elocution
and grooming and fittings.

1053
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:31,006
Well, blow me down.

1054
01:23:32,217 --> 01:23:34,426
Pan Am's working
out of the Cocoanut Grove?

1055
01:23:34,594 --> 01:23:36,553
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Juan.

1056
01:23:36,721 --> 01:23:38,430
Helen, good to see you.

1057
01:23:38,598 --> 01:23:41,099
- How are you, Howard?
- Good, thanks.

1058
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,101
- This is Faith Domergue.
- Sit down.

1059
01:23:43,269 --> 01:23:45,103
- Pleasure.
- What are you doing here?

1060
01:23:45,271 --> 01:23:48,106
Well, I'm out to meet
with Douglas about the DC-4.

1061
01:23:48,274 --> 01:23:52,110
It's our new plane, and it is
gonna be a pip, let me tell you.

1062
01:23:52,278 --> 01:23:55,489
- How's the Constellation coming?
- Good.

1063
01:23:55,782 --> 01:23:57,074
Great.

1064
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,953
So how about letting me steal a peek?

1065
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:04,915
I don't think so.

1066
01:24:05,083 --> 01:24:08,126
I should be cross with you.
You stole Ray Loewy from us.

1067
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:12,464
- He's doing our interior design. That's right.
- He was doing ours.

1068
01:24:14,968 --> 01:24:16,718
So ...

1069
01:24:17,262 --> 01:24:19,721
... what are your colors?
- Stop fishing.

1070
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:23,976
So you have buttons ...

1071
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:25,561
... or zippers?

1072
01:24:25,979 --> 01:24:27,271
I'm sorry?

1073
01:24:29,190 --> 01:24:33,110
Buttons or zippers for the drapes
on the sleeping berths?

1074
01:24:36,614 --> 01:24:38,282
Zippers.

1075
01:24:47,166 --> 01:24:48,750
Buttons.

1076
01:24:58,428 --> 01:25:01,430
So I suppose you'll be
expanding on down to Mexico.

1077
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:05,475
- Why do you say that?
- Well, your range is 3000 miles.

1078
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:09,730
I'd imagine you'd expand from Los Angeles
to Mexico and South America.

1079
01:25:09,897 --> 01:25:12,065
Hey, that's a good idea.
Anyone got a pen?

1080
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:14,359
Or across the Atlantic.

1081
01:25:17,363 --> 01:25:19,281
You've had enough of this ice cream.

1082
01:25:19,449 --> 01:25:23,035
You give me that spoon. You don't
wanna get your gloves all sticky.

1083
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:26,872
Isn't that too far?

1084
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:33,795
New York ...

1085
01:25:33,963 --> 01:25:36,006
... to Newfoundland ...

1086
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:37,966
... to Ireland.

1087
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:44,806
To Paris.

1088
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,565
Well ...

1089
01:25:54,108 --> 01:25:56,234
... Pan Am welcomes you.

1090
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,236
We're overbooked as it is.

1091
01:25:58,404 --> 01:26:02,032
It's such a burden doing it all
on your own, let me tell you.

1092
01:26:02,200 --> 01:26:04,242
So when's the Connie gonna be ready?

1093
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:07,079
- Next year maybe. DC-4?
- Next year.

1094
01:26:07,246 --> 01:26:10,415
Well, we look forward to her then.

1095
01:26:10,958 --> 01:26:12,709
And I to the Connie.

1096
01:26:14,587 --> 01:26:18,215
I've ordered the next 40 after you.

1097
01:26:18,424 --> 01:26:20,217
- It's Miss ...?
- Domergue.

1098
01:26:20,385 --> 01:26:23,762
Yes, of course. Now, was that a
rumba or a samba you were doing?

1099
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,932
- I' was a samba.
- A samba, yes.

1100
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,352
Howard, I never knew
you were such a good dancer.

1101
01:26:31,312 --> 01:26:33,146
Helen, Jack.

1102
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:37,776
Good going. You gave away
our entire postwar strategy.

1103
01:26:37,944 --> 01:26:42,447
- He can't stop us.
- He's Pan Am. He can stop anything.

1104
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:46,284
Give me the largest
Scotch you got.

1105
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:50,038
I don't know what in the hell you're
so damn giddy about. Excuse me.

1106
01:28:42,109 --> 01:28:43,568
Jack.

1107
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:47,364
Get in touch with Joyce and Berg.
Those are my boys in Washington.

1108
01:28:47,532 --> 01:28:50,909
Set up a meeting with Jones,
secretary of commerce, old golfing buddy.

1109
01:28:51,077 --> 01:28:54,037
- Slow down.
- We'll need terminals in Ireland and France.

1110
01:28:54,205 --> 01:28:55,664
I wanna get some tax breaks.

1111
01:28:55,832 --> 01:28:59,501
If that ass thinks he owns the world,
he's got another thing coming.

1112
01:28:59,669 --> 01:29:02,546
Pan Am owns Europe.
We ought to think about Mexico.

1113
01:29:02,713 --> 01:29:06,800
To hell with Mexico. No airline should
have a monopoly on flying the Atlantic.

1114
01:29:06,968 --> 01:29:10,262
It just isn't fair.
He owns Pan Am, he owns Congress.

1115
01:29:10,429 --> 01:29:14,266
He owns the Civil Aeronautics Board,
but he does not own the sky.

1116
01:29:14,433 --> 01:29:17,102
We're in a street fight
with that son of a bitch.

1117
01:29:17,270 --> 01:29:20,939
I've been fighting high-hat
Ivy League pricks like him my whole life.

1118
01:29:21,107 --> 01:29:24,734
And listen, fire Ray Loewy.
You goddamn heard me? Fire Ray Loewy.

1119
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:28,280
He's spying for Trippe.
That shitheel knew all about the buttons.

1120
01:29:28,447 --> 01:29:30,448
Spies in my midst, Jack.

1121
01:29:31,117 --> 01:29:32,951
Spies in my midst.

1122
01:29:47,383 --> 01:29:50,302
- Hello, Howard.
- Roland.

1123
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:53,763
So ...

1124
01:29:53,931 --> 01:29:55,473
... what can I do for you?

1125
01:29:58,644 --> 01:30:02,647
I want all the pictures you have
of Kate Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.

1126
01:30:02,815 --> 01:30:06,359
All the negatives.
And I want you to kill the story.

1127
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:09,905
Howard, he's a married man.
He's a Catholic.

1128
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:12,324
They're movie stars.
Fair game all around.

1129
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,001
My office knows where I am, Howard.

1130
01:30:24,003 --> 01:30:26,838
I'm not gonna kill you, Roland.

1131
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:28,924
I don't do that.

1132
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,306
- How much?
- Not for sale.

1133
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:41,144
How much?

1134
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:45,190
Not for sale.

1135
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:50,612
You ever cheat on your wife, Roland?

1136
01:30:52,406 --> 01:30:54,866
You ever screw a colored girl?

1137
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,703
You ever steal anything?
You ever hurt anyone?

1138
01:31:00,873 --> 01:31:02,707
Good night, Howard.

1139
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:06,044
You ever go to
a Communist Party meeting, Roland?

1140
01:31:15,888 --> 01:31:18,056
TWA stock.

1141
01:31:19,058 --> 01:31:20,350
How much?

1142
01:31:21,936 --> 01:31:23,395
Fifty thousand shares.

1143
01:31:24,063 --> 01:31:25,522
Ten.

1144
01:31:28,567 --> 01:31:29,901
All right.

1145
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,864
This isn't gonna be that easy.

1146
01:31:35,241 --> 01:31:38,618
He's been making big contributions
on both sides of the aisle.

1147
01:31:38,786 --> 01:31:42,247
And Jack Frye is out there
lobbying everybody in town.

1148
01:31:42,415 --> 01:31:45,583
The French and British ambassadors
are lined up on his side.

1149
01:31:46,919 --> 01:31:50,088
I'm telling you, TWA is serious
about going international.

1150
01:31:50,256 --> 01:31:51,881
Okay.

1151
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,967
Point, Mr. Hughes.

1152
01:31:54,343 --> 01:31:58,013
I think it's time for you to introduce
the community airline bill ...

1153
01:31:58,180 --> 01:31:59,723
... on the floor of the Senate.

1154
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:03,518
- Is it done?
- My people are finishing it right now.

1155
01:32:03,686 --> 01:32:08,231
I also have to get you on the committee
investigating the national defense.

1156
01:32:10,651 --> 01:32:13,737
On the committee or chairman?

1157
01:32:14,071 --> 01:32:16,740
I could be much more effective
as chairman.

1158
01:32:16,907 --> 01:32:20,660
It's a great public platform.
You know, it generates a lot of press.

1159
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:24,289
- Wasn't Truman chairman of that committee?
- Yeah, right.

1160
01:32:24,457 --> 01:32:26,875
He's vice president.
Look what he did with it.

1161
01:32:27,043 --> 01:32:29,127
No, I think ...

1162
01:32:29,795 --> 01:32:31,755
I think chairman.

1163
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:33,840
What do you think?

1164
01:32:35,885 --> 01:32:38,470
- Chairman. That is interesting.
- Yeah.

1165
01:32:38,637 --> 01:32:42,140
Let me show you
these specs for the DC-4.

1166
01:32:42,391 --> 01:32:45,852
Ava, what do you think about
Trans World Airlines?

1167
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:48,563
Transcontinental and Western
doesn't fit anymore.

1168
01:32:48,731 --> 01:32:51,608
We're international,
we need a name that reflects that.

1169
01:32:51,776 --> 01:32:54,486
Trans World is good. Kind of peppy.

1170
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:57,155
TWA, right?

1171
01:32:57,323 --> 01:33:00,116
That way you don't need
to repaint any of the planes.

1172
01:33:00,284 --> 01:33:02,452
That's you. Always pinching pennies.

1173
01:33:03,621 --> 01:33:05,622
Hand me my wrap.

1174
01:33:19,637 --> 01:33:21,805
Knock it off.

1175
01:33:28,020 --> 01:33:30,522
I have something for you.

1176
01:33:31,774 --> 01:33:33,608
Stay here.

1177
01:33:39,073 --> 01:33:41,741
- What the hell is this?
- It's a present.

1178
01:33:41,909 --> 01:33:43,827
Go on, open it.

1179
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:48,456
Oh, a box of trash.
You shouldn't have.

1180
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:50,333
Keep looking, keep looking.

1181
01:33:55,172 --> 01:33:57,215
It's a Kashmiri sapphire.

1182
01:33:57,383 --> 01:34:00,552
I had my boys all over
the damn globe looking for this.

1183
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:01,970
Why?

1184
01:34:02,138 --> 01:34:03,388
Because.

1185
01:34:03,556 --> 01:34:05,223
Look.

1186
01:34:05,391 --> 01:34:07,433
It matches your eyes.

1187
01:34:07,601 --> 01:34:09,978
I am not for sale.

1188
01:34:10,146 --> 01:34:12,230
For chrissakes, it's just a present.

1189
01:34:12,398 --> 01:34:15,567
You can't buy me, Howard,
so stop trying.

1190
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:19,320
Don't buy me any more diamonds
or sapphires or any other damn thing.

1191
01:34:19,488 --> 01:34:21,906
You can buy me dinner.
How about that?

1192
01:34:22,658 --> 01:34:23,908
Jesus, Ava.

1193
01:34:24,952 --> 01:34:28,037
It's bad enough I have to endure
those gym shoes of yours.

1194
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:31,875
But I get all dolled up and we go out
in this jalopy without a hood.

1195
01:34:33,294 --> 01:34:36,421
Ava, will you marry me?

1196
01:34:36,589 --> 01:34:39,299
- No, Howard.
- Well, why not, for heaven's sake?

1197
01:34:39,466 --> 01:34:42,051
In the first place, I don't love you.

1198
01:34:42,219 --> 01:34:44,596
In the second place, I'm still married.

1199
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:49,434
Look, you got girls stashed all over town.
You got a damn harem just at the Bel-Air.

1200
01:34:49,602 --> 01:34:51,561
Marry one of your bungalow girls.

1201
01:34:51,729 --> 01:34:55,523
Those are employees. I won't marry
an employee. How would that look?

1202
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:04,949
What is going on?

1203
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:10,914
- Oh, my God!
- Goddamn it!

1204
01:35:12,541 --> 01:35:13,791
Faith!

1205
01:35:14,585 --> 01:35:16,502
- Faith, what the hell?
- Look out!

1206
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:19,380
Goddamn, what the hell are you doing?

1207
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:25,303
- Are you okay, lady?
- What are you doing with her?

1208
01:35:25,471 --> 01:35:28,139
We are going to dinner.
Now, get out of there.

1209
01:35:28,307 --> 01:35:30,308
Get that crazy bitch away from me!

1210
01:35:30,476 --> 01:35:32,101
Don't you love me anymore?

1211
01:35:32,269 --> 01:35:33,811
Course I love you, pork chop.

1212
01:35:33,979 --> 01:35:35,772
Ava, look over here. Howard.

1213
01:35:36,482 --> 01:35:37,774
Hey.

1214
01:35:41,195 --> 01:35:43,821
Juan Trippe is working
with Senator Brewster now.

1215
01:35:43,989 --> 01:35:48,326
They're after you. If the community
airline bill becomes law, we are finished.

1216
01:35:48,494 --> 01:35:50,620
Pan Am will have a monopoly
on international travel.

1217
01:35:50,788 --> 01:35:53,331
Well, how can they justify it?
It's un-American.

1218
01:35:53,499 --> 01:35:57,335
Brewster is saying that nationalized
foreign carriers, like Air France ...

1219
01:35:57,503 --> 01:36:00,505
... can offer lower rates because
they don't have to compete.

1220
01:36:00,673 --> 01:36:04,008
Let's get rid of competition
and have a nationalized airline ...

1221
01:36:04,176 --> 01:36:07,220
... and why don't we make it Pan Am?
- I'm not kowtowing to anyone.

1222
01:36:07,388 --> 01:36:09,681
- Howard, I need you up here.
- One sec, Odie.

1223
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:12,350
Look, we are Trans World Airlines,
all right?

1224
01:36:12,518 --> 01:36:16,896
Get me something with a circle or a globe
or something round, for God's sake.

1225
01:36:17,064 --> 01:36:18,356
- Speak up.
- One cut.

1226
01:36:18,524 --> 01:36:22,694
I don't give a rat's ass. I'm not making
a cut. I'll release it without a seal.

1227
01:36:22,861 --> 01:36:24,529
We gotta go public with this.

1228
01:36:24,697 --> 01:36:26,572
I'm gonna talk to Hearst ...

1229
01:36:26,740 --> 01:36:29,909
... but we gotta get
some senators on our side.

1230
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:32,495
- What do you want me to do?
- What Trippe does.

1231
01:36:32,663 --> 01:36:35,373
Offshore operations.
See who's up for re-election ...

1232
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:38,167
... let's start making donations.
- Bribe senators?

1233
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:41,254
I don't want them bribed.
I want it done legally.

1234
01:36:41,422 --> 01:36:44,757
I want them bought.
Put a team of investigators on Brewster.

1235
01:36:44,925 --> 01:36:47,260
I need to know everything
about that shitbag.

1236
01:36:47,428 --> 01:36:50,346
Where he goes, what he says
and who he screws.

1237
01:36:50,514 --> 01:36:52,515
- Get into it right now.
- You got it.

1238
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:01,566
Just give me a second.

1239
01:37:03,902 --> 01:37:06,904
- All right, what do you need?
- Rudder and elevators.

1240
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:09,657
No. These are fine.

1241
01:37:09,825 --> 01:37:13,911
Have Simon and Pete get back to me on the
assemblies. We need a secondary system.

1242
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:15,580
Okay.

1243
01:37:16,415 --> 01:37:19,083
Listen, we need to take
another look at the wheel.

1244
01:37:19,251 --> 01:37:22,086
- Jesus. The damn wheel?
- Yeah.

1245
01:37:22,254 --> 01:37:23,755
It just doesn't feel right.

1246
01:37:23,922 --> 01:37:27,925
Christ almighty, you've seen 8000
goddamn wheels. Choose one, please.

1247
01:37:28,093 --> 01:37:29,927
- Just one of them.
- I know, I know.

1248
01:37:30,095 --> 01:37:32,430
- This one?
- I know, this one ...

1249
01:37:32,598 --> 01:37:36,434
This one's pretty close. Pretty close.

1250
01:38:12,471 --> 01:38:13,971
Odie.

1251
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:17,433
That man sweeping up over there ...

1252
01:38:17,601 --> 01:38:20,645
... does he work for me?
I mean, have you seen him before?

1253
01:38:20,813 --> 01:38:23,398
Name's Nick, something like that.

1254
01:38:25,651 --> 01:38:27,402
Why's he looking at me?

1255
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:31,030
I don't know.

1256
01:38:33,158 --> 01:38:36,285
Fire him. And make sure
they use damp brooms from now on.

1257
01:38:36,453 --> 01:38:39,831
Respiratory diseases are expensive,
and I don't want lawsuits.

1258
01:38:39,998 --> 01:38:42,875
But can we at least proceed
with the instrument panel?

1259
01:38:43,043 --> 01:38:45,503
- The tool shop's ready.
- I wanna see the blueprints.

1260
01:38:45,671 --> 01:38:48,631
Look, Howard, the deadline
is now completely unrealistic.

1261
01:38:48,799 --> 01:38:51,342
The war is gonna be over
by the time she's done.

1262
01:38:51,510 --> 01:38:55,680
I need you to help consult on vital decisions,
and you're off dealing with movies.

1263
01:38:55,848 --> 01:38:58,850
You got 1,000 workers waiting
for you to make a decision --

1264
01:38:59,017 --> 01:39:00,643
Hey, Odie!

1265
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,812
Take it easy, all right.

1266
01:39:02,980 --> 01:39:07,024
You're under pressure, but it's gonna
do me no good if you crack up on me.

1267
01:39:07,693 --> 01:39:09,444
All right? Look ...

1268
01:39:09,611 --> 01:39:11,946
... take a couple of hours off, all right.

1269
01:39:12,114 --> 01:39:13,990
- You just relax a little.
- Okay.

1270
01:39:14,408 --> 01:39:16,451
- See your wife.
- Okay.

1271
01:39:16,869 --> 01:39:18,202
All right.

1272
01:39:19,079 --> 01:39:22,331
- Be sure to show me all the blueprints.
- All right.

1273
01:39:23,959 --> 01:39:28,671
Show me all the blueprints.

1274
01:39:28,839 --> 01:39:32,467
I'm serious, now.
Show me all the blueprints.

1275
01:39:34,052 --> 01:39:35,720
Show me all the blueprints.

1276
01:39:35,888 --> 01:39:38,764
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.

1277
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:44,854
Show me all the blueprints.

1278
01:39:45,022 --> 01:39:47,106
I wanna get this done right.

1279
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:55,740
Show me all the blueprints.

1280
01:39:55,908 --> 01:39:57,825
- Howard.
- Show me all the blueprints.

1281
01:39:57,993 --> 01:40:01,662
Show me all the blueprints.
Show me all the blueprints ...

1282
01:40:28,649 --> 01:40:31,108
Quarantine.

1283
01:40:32,110 --> 01:40:33,819
Q ...

1284
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:35,947
... U ...

1285
01:40:36,114 --> 01:40:38,366
... A ...

1286
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:40,952
... R ...

1287
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,579
... A ...

1288
01:40:43,747 --> 01:40:45,248
... N ...

1289
01:40:45,415 --> 01:40:47,625
... T ...

1290
01:40:48,001 --> 01:40:49,585
... I ...

1291
01:40:49,753 --> 01:40:51,254
... N ...

1292
01:40:56,176 --> 01:40:58,219
... E.

1293
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:03,224
Quarantine.

1294
01:41:41,221 --> 01:41:44,307
General McEwan. Colonel Bertrang.
Thanks for coming down.

1295
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:46,642
Odie, you reading me okay?

1296
01:41:46,810 --> 01:41:48,019
Yeah, you're A-Okay.

1297
01:41:53,692 --> 01:41:56,861
All right, flight controls are active.
She's all yours.

1298
01:42:05,787 --> 01:42:08,122
Spotless.
No wiggle on the wheel or throttle.

1299
01:42:08,290 --> 01:42:10,124
Take it easy.

1300
01:42:27,142 --> 01:42:30,728
- How does she sound, Howard?
- She's whispering to me, buddy.

1301
01:42:30,896 --> 01:42:32,813
All right, make her sing.

1302
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:56,921
Well, Odie, she can fly. Congratulations.

1303
01:42:57,089 --> 01:43:00,591
I'm glad to hear it. Retract landing gear
and climb to 5000 feet ...

1304
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:02,343
... on a heading of 2-7-0.

1305
01:43:02,511 --> 01:43:08,391
Retracting landing gear and climbing
to 5,000 feet on a heading 2-7-0.

1306
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:15,106
- She's fast.
- What's your air speed?

1307
01:43:15,273 --> 01:43:16,899
292.

1308
01:43:17,109 --> 01:43:20,611
- All right, take her back to 200.
- No damn way.

1309
01:43:46,430 --> 01:43:48,139
We gotta bring her home.

1310
01:43:48,306 --> 01:43:50,766
Scheduled time of one hour
and 45 minutes has elapsed.

1311
01:43:50,976 --> 01:43:53,894
- Set course for 0-9-0 --
- Ten more minutes. Roger that.

1312
01:43:54,062 --> 01:43:56,647
Negative, Howard. Bring her home.

1313
01:43:56,815 --> 01:44:02,695
Okay. Okay. Setting course for 0-9-0.

1314
01:44:03,405 --> 01:44:05,322
Preparing to descend.

1315
01:44:08,952 --> 01:44:12,204
- Jesus.
- What is it, Howard?

1316
01:44:13,498 --> 01:44:17,001
The right wing just dipped.
I'm losing starboard engine.

1317
01:44:17,461 --> 01:44:20,087
Increasing power to 2800 rpm.

1318
01:44:20,547 --> 01:44:21,797
Cutting back.

1319
01:44:22,174 --> 01:44:24,091
Increasing starboard engine only.

1320
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:27,970
Cutting back. I'm losing altitude.

1321
01:44:28,138 --> 01:44:30,681
Check starboard-engine manifold pressure.

1322
01:44:31,558 --> 01:44:35,436
- It's good, but rpm's are low.
- Are both starboard props turning?

1323
01:44:35,604 --> 01:44:37,062
Hold on.

1324
01:44:37,314 --> 01:44:40,357
They are, but she's pulling me
back and starboard, Odie.

1325
01:44:40,525 --> 01:44:43,110
- How bad is your cross control?
- I'm at full left rudder ...

1326
01:44:43,278 --> 01:44:46,572
... and full left aileron,
but she won't stay level. Goddamn it.

1327
01:44:46,865 --> 01:44:49,700
- Give us your position.
- Two thousand feet over --

1328
01:44:49,868 --> 01:44:53,954
Oh, Christ, I don't know, Beverly Hills.
Fifteen hundred feet.

1329
01:44:54,122 --> 01:44:55,831
We're going down.

1330
01:44:56,750 --> 01:45:00,377
I'll try for the Wilshire Country Club.
Ninth hole. You reading me?

1331
01:45:00,545 --> 01:45:04,465
Wilshire Country Club, copy that.
Howard, reduce engines to 1,000.

1332
01:45:05,175 --> 01:45:10,137
I'm going down!
I'm not gonna make it, buddy!

1333
01:45:16,603 --> 01:45:18,395
Goddamn it!

1334
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:24,271
Is there anyone else inside?
Is there anyone else?!

1335
01:47:24,439 --> 01:47:26,148
No.

1336
01:47:29,986 --> 01:47:33,364
I'm Howard Hughes, the aviator.

1337
01:47:42,624 --> 01:47:45,334
-- every inch of his
wiring and fluid connection.

1338
01:47:45,502 --> 01:47:48,170
He has burns to 78 percent of his body.

1339
01:47:48,338 --> 01:47:51,006
Nine ribs are shattered,
not broken, shattered ...

1340
01:47:51,508 --> 01:47:55,970
... as are his nose, his chin, his cheek,
his left knee, his left elbow.

1341
01:47:56,137 --> 01:47:58,722
He has 60 lacerations
on his face, to the bone.

1342
01:47:59,307 --> 01:48:02,059
His chest was crushed,
so his left lung collapsed ...

1343
01:48:02,227 --> 01:48:05,896
... and his heart has shifted
to the right side of his chest cavity.

1344
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:08,732
Jesus, God.

1345
01:48:09,192 --> 01:48:13,529
- He's getting blood transfusions now, but --
- Whose blood?

1346
01:48:14,364 --> 01:48:16,532
- I'm sorry?
- Whose blood?

1347
01:48:17,033 --> 01:48:18,575
From our stock.

1348
01:48:19,244 --> 01:48:23,414
- Oh, he's not going to like that.
- Mr. Dietrich, I doubt he's ...

1349
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:26,542
... ever gonna like or
dislike anything again.

1350
01:48:27,168 --> 01:48:29,336
I'm terribly sorry.

1351
01:48:57,782 --> 01:48:59,700
Orange juice.

1352
01:49:02,787 --> 01:49:06,248
It's not fresh from the kitchen, so I ...

1353
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:12,046
I have them make it here so ...
So I can see.

1354
01:49:16,134 --> 01:49:18,093
Look at me.

1355
01:49:20,722 --> 01:49:22,723
I'm a monster.

1356
01:49:23,183 --> 01:49:27,978
Yeah. Orange juice has nutritional value.

1357
01:49:29,147 --> 01:49:34,151
There's ... There's some flies
outside my window, though.

1358
01:49:34,694 --> 01:49:36,487
So ...

1359
01:49:38,490 --> 01:49:41,158
... little Howard likes ...

1360
01:49:42,660 --> 01:49:44,787
... citrus.

1361
01:49:45,538 --> 01:49:47,414
Don't he just ...?

1362
01:49:50,543 --> 01:49:52,252
Tell me.

1363
01:49:53,880 --> 01:49:57,674
An oil seal ripped off
the starboard rear propeller.

1364
01:49:57,842 --> 01:50:01,345
When the pressure dropped,
the prop reversed pitch.

1365
01:50:01,846 --> 01:50:03,597
Do you understand me?

1366
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:09,144
Howard, I'm sorry to have to tell you
this now, but there's something else.

1367
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:12,272
- You following me?
- Yeah.

1368
01:50:13,483 --> 01:50:17,152
The Air Force canceled the contract
on The Hercules.

1369
01:50:19,489 --> 01:50:24,868
The war's over now,
and they say they don't need it anymore.

1370
01:50:25,370 --> 01:50:29,832
I have to know what you want me to do.
Should I release the staff?

1371
01:50:29,999 --> 01:50:32,084
How far ...

1372
01:50:33,878 --> 01:50:35,337
... from finishing?

1373
01:50:36,548 --> 01:50:41,385
- About six months.
- No, in money.

1374
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:46,515
Seven million.

1375
01:50:47,308 --> 01:50:48,684
Maybe more.

1376
01:50:54,065 --> 01:50:55,899
Build it.

1377
01:50:57,402 --> 01:50:59,361
Build it, Odie.

1378
01:51:01,197 --> 01:51:02,739
Howard ...

1379
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:07,411
... a Constellation crashed
outside Reading, Pennsylvania.

1380
01:51:07,912 --> 01:51:11,331
The Civil Aeronautics Board
has grounded the whole fleet.

1381
01:51:21,301 --> 01:51:22,968
You know ...

1382
01:51:24,053 --> 01:51:27,306
... Juan Trippe sent me flowers.

1383
01:51:29,517 --> 01:51:31,226
Take a look.

1384
01:51:34,981 --> 01:51:39,860
- What did you do with all the others?
- Oh, I had them taken out.

1385
01:51:40,028 --> 01:51:43,197
They ... They attract aphids.

1386
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:48,952
Aphids are ...
They're just awful little creatures.

1387
01:51:49,787 --> 01:51:51,580
But ...

1388
01:51:53,917 --> 01:51:56,001
But these ones ...

1389
01:51:56,961 --> 01:52:00,839
... I wanted to see these ones every day.

1390
01:52:08,389 --> 01:52:11,391
Can white elephants fly?
That's everybody's question.

1391
01:52:11,559 --> 01:52:16,605
The hull of the world's mightiest airplane,
a flying boat built by Howard Hughes.

1392
01:52:16,773 --> 01:52:20,943
Two hundred and twenty feet long,
it towers higher than a five-story building.

1393
01:52:21,110 --> 01:52:25,113
Power lines have to be cut as it starts
the trip from Culver City ...

1394
01:52:25,281 --> 01:52:27,324
... to the Pacific, 30 miles away.

1395
01:52:27,492 --> 01:52:30,702
Moving the 60-ton load
is quite an engineering problem.

1396
01:52:30,870 --> 01:52:34,831
But you gotta ask, was anything this big
ever supposed to fly?

1397
01:52:34,999 --> 01:52:39,503
There goes one wing section,
160 feet long with four engine housings.

1398
01:52:39,671 --> 01:52:42,547
Double that and you've got some idea
of the wingspread.

1399
01:52:42,715 --> 01:52:47,010
An airplane that challenges
a mountain for sheer size.

1400
01:52:54,018 --> 01:52:56,270
How long can they keep us grounded?

1401
01:52:56,437 --> 01:53:00,023
Until they finish investigating
the Reading crash. Could be months.

1402
01:53:00,191 --> 01:53:05,112
You're running a $14 million deficit. How
will you afford to keep them out of service?

1403
01:53:05,321 --> 01:53:09,825
- We go international, we'll make it up.
- Brewster's C.A.B. bill isn't going away.

1404
01:53:09,993 --> 01:53:12,703
That bill passes,
and you bought these for nothing.

1405
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:16,290
- We're fighting the C.A.B. bill.
- Meanwhile, how do we keep TWA flying?

1406
01:53:16,457 --> 01:53:21,044
Don't say, "Just go to Tool Co." We're
pumping every cent into The Hercules ...

1407
01:53:21,212 --> 01:53:24,047
... which the Air Force
doesn't even want anymore.

1408
01:53:24,215 --> 01:53:27,968
I'm glad Jack is feeling sunny about things,
but I've seen the books.

1409
01:53:28,303 --> 01:53:30,721
I'm telling it straight. I'm not crying wolf.

1410
01:53:30,888 --> 01:53:34,016
We're in serious trouble.
You've gotta make a choice.

1411
01:53:34,183 --> 01:53:39,229
You wanna be bankrupted
by the big plane or by the big airline?

1412
01:53:46,571 --> 01:53:50,157
Go see Thomas Parkinson
at the Equitable in New York.

1413
01:53:50,325 --> 01:53:53,910
Get a loan against
all the TWA equipment and capital.

1414
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:59,916
Use the planes as collateral. Hell, use the
desks, use the pens, use everything we got.

1415
01:54:00,084 --> 01:54:04,254
- Try to get me 40 million.
- And if TWA defaults on the loan?

1416
01:54:04,839 --> 01:54:07,758
Then Juan Trippe buys us cheap.

1417
01:54:10,345 --> 01:54:13,430
Under my bed! You put a goddamn
microphone under my bed!

1418
01:54:13,598 --> 01:54:15,766
Listen to me.
I am concerned about you.

1419
01:54:15,933 --> 01:54:19,269
- I just wanna make sure you're okay.
- And who is in that car?!

1420
01:54:19,604 --> 01:54:21,772
It's been with me 24 hours a day.

1421
01:54:21,939 --> 01:54:23,732
That car is for your protection!

1422
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:27,361
The only one I need protection from is you,
you sick bastard!

1423
01:54:27,528 --> 01:54:29,071
You don't own me, Howard.

1424
01:54:29,238 --> 01:54:32,366
I'm not one of your teenage whores
or some damn airplane.

1425
01:54:32,533 --> 01:54:34,576
I'll have them take all the bugs out.

1426
01:54:34,744 --> 01:54:36,787
I need to know where you are.

1427
01:54:36,954 --> 01:54:39,623
- Why?!
- Because I worry about you, that's why.

1428
01:54:39,791 --> 01:54:41,792
Bullshit!

1429
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:55,097
What do you mean, "all the bugs"?

1430
01:54:57,392 --> 01:54:59,393
There's more.

1431
01:54:59,644 --> 01:55:01,478
How many?

1432
01:55:01,771 --> 01:55:07,943
I don't know, 12.
Twelve, maybe, and on the telephones.

1433
01:55:08,403 --> 01:55:12,072
Oh, Christ, Howard, on the telephone?

1434
01:55:12,240 --> 01:55:13,824
You listen to my phone calls?

1435
01:55:13,991 --> 01:55:17,828
No, no, honey, I would never do that.
I'd never do that.

1436
01:55:17,995 --> 01:55:20,997
I just read the transcripts, that's all.

1437
01:55:25,628 --> 01:55:27,754
What do you wanna know, Howard?

1438
01:55:27,922 --> 01:55:30,090
Was I screwing Artie Shaw last night?

1439
01:55:30,258 --> 01:55:32,968
Was I screwing Sinatra the night before?
You bet.

1440
01:55:33,136 --> 01:55:35,720
Everyone said you were a lunatic,
I didn't listen.

1441
01:55:35,888 --> 01:55:38,807
It's no wonder Kate Hepburn
dumped your demented ass!

1442
01:55:38,975 --> 01:55:41,435
Shut your goddamn mouth.

1443
01:55:45,606 --> 01:55:49,025
Get out, you pathetic freak.

1444
01:55:56,451 --> 01:55:58,618
Get out!

1445
01:55:58,786 --> 01:56:00,454
Is everything all right, sir?

1446
01:56:00,621 --> 01:56:02,956
Take out all the bugs, huh?

1447
01:56:05,084 --> 01:56:07,210
Except for the one
on the bedroom phone.

1448
01:56:07,378 --> 01:56:09,171
Sir, the FBI are at the house.

1449
01:56:11,007 --> 01:56:15,594
This is outrageous! Everything here is the
private property of Hughes Productions.

1450
01:56:15,761 --> 01:56:18,472
- My legal counsel is on the way --
- Federal warrant.

1451
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:20,891
Don't interfere with the search, sir.

1452
01:56:40,578 --> 01:56:44,080
Dateline: Los Angeles.
Howard Hughes has a new houseguest.

1453
01:56:44,248 --> 01:56:47,876
No, it's not another beautiful starlet.
This time it's the FBI.

1454
01:56:48,044 --> 01:56:51,922
Noah, you've got to help. This is
the 10th time they have been here.

1455
01:56:52,089 --> 01:56:55,592
Rumor has it that agents
working for Senator Owen Brewster ...

1456
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,596
... have practically taken up residence
in the aviation mogul's home.

1457
01:56:59,764 --> 01:57:01,848
Look, I mean, they are touching things.

1458
01:57:02,183 --> 01:57:05,310
- Noah, they are touching things.
- Just keep yourself calm ...

1459
01:57:05,478 --> 01:57:08,522
... and I'll be down there
as soon as I can, Howard.

1460
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:12,400
Howard?

1461
01:57:36,759 --> 01:57:38,635
Howard, hello.

1462
01:57:38,803 --> 01:57:42,138
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you. Come on inside.

1463
01:57:42,306 --> 01:57:44,849
- Emma, you can start up lunch now.
- Yes, sir.

1464
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:49,521
Well, really lovely room.
It's nicely decorated.

1465
01:57:49,689 --> 01:57:51,481
Thank you. Here, have a seat.

1466
01:57:51,649 --> 01:57:53,066
Thanks for coming by.

1467
01:57:53,234 --> 01:57:56,361
I thought you and l
should have a chance to talk privately.

1468
01:57:56,529 --> 01:57:58,321
You know, outside the office.

1469
01:58:00,324 --> 01:58:01,658
Well ...

1470
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,160
... I appreciate that, Owen.

1471
01:58:11,544 --> 01:58:16,590
So you're coming out pretty strong
against the C.A.B. bill.

1472
01:58:17,341 --> 01:58:22,429
- You're coming on pretty strong for it.
- Well, it's my bill, Howard, you know.

1473
01:58:22,597 --> 01:58:26,850
Look, I believe sincerely
that America cannot afford ...

1474
01:58:27,018 --> 01:58:29,853
... to have more than one
international carrier.

1475
01:58:31,397 --> 01:58:36,568
I mean, do you think it's fair that one airline
should have a monopoly on international --?

1476
01:58:36,736 --> 01:58:40,113
A monopoly? No, no, no. Oh, no.

1477
01:58:40,281 --> 01:58:45,368
No, I think one airline could do it better,
see, without competition.

1478
01:58:45,703 --> 01:58:50,373
All I'm thinking about are the interests,
the needs of the American passenger.

1479
01:58:50,708 --> 01:58:53,668
That's just beautiful. What is that?

1480
01:58:57,882 --> 01:59:00,175
What is that? Is that a ...?

1481
01:59:00,343 --> 01:59:02,218
Is that a yak?

1482
01:59:02,386 --> 01:59:05,138
- Some kind of a yak?
- No, that's a llama.

1483
01:59:05,306 --> 01:59:07,557
My wife picked that up
when we were in Peru.

1484
01:59:07,725 --> 01:59:09,809
Son of a gun.

1485
01:59:09,977 --> 01:59:12,479
A real llama.

1486
01:59:13,773 --> 01:59:17,400
- From Peru?
- Yeah. From a year ago, I think it was --

1487
01:59:17,568 --> 01:59:20,779
- Yeah, it was about a year ago.
- Lunch is served, senator.

1488
01:59:20,946 --> 01:59:23,448
Good. Okay.
Come on, let's go have some lunch.

1489
01:59:25,034 --> 01:59:29,037
Now, did you --?
Did you actually get to see any llamas?

1490
01:59:29,205 --> 01:59:31,665
No, no. My wife just liked the painting.

1491
01:59:31,832 --> 01:59:34,918
It's an interesting animal.
I'll have to read up on those.

1492
01:59:35,086 --> 01:59:39,506
How do you spell that?
Like ...? Like Fernando Lamas?

1493
01:59:39,882 --> 01:59:44,135
No, no. It's --
It's the animal, it's got two L's.

1494
01:59:44,303 --> 01:59:46,346
Here, come on, have a seat.

1495
01:59:55,481 --> 01:59:57,941
It's brook trout. Hope you like fish.

1496
02:00:00,486 --> 02:00:04,114
I love it. Thanks.

1497
02:00:19,338 --> 02:00:23,466
I know you're not a drinking man,
so I hope -- Hope water's okay.

1498
02:00:36,355 --> 02:00:37,981
Thanks.

1499
02:00:43,904 --> 02:00:47,323
All right, let's get down to business.
Let's talk turkey.

1500
02:00:48,159 --> 02:00:50,493
My investigators --

1501
02:00:51,245 --> 02:00:54,080
My investigators
have turned up a lot of dirt.

1502
02:00:54,540 --> 02:00:57,876
It could be really embarrassing
if this stuff got out.

1503
02:00:58,586 --> 02:01:01,129
I'd like to save you
from that embarrassment.

1504
02:01:02,381 --> 02:01:04,507
That's very kind of you, Owen.

1505
02:01:07,511 --> 02:01:11,347
My committee has the power
to hold public hearings.

1506
02:01:12,933 --> 02:01:14,851
I'd like to spare you that.

1507
02:01:15,519 --> 02:01:16,770
Would you, now?

1508
02:01:18,105 --> 02:01:19,647
Look ...

1509
02:01:19,815 --> 02:01:24,527
Do you wanna go down in history
as a war profiteer, Howard?

1510
02:01:24,695 --> 02:01:25,945
Is that what you want?

1511
02:01:28,449 --> 02:01:30,700
What do you want, Owen?

1512
02:01:32,244 --> 02:01:38,374
You agree to support my C.A.B. bill,
and I won't hold public hearings.

1513
02:01:38,542 --> 02:01:40,251
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

1514
02:01:40,419 --> 02:01:44,047
I can't do that, Owen.
The C.A.B. would kill TWA.

1515
02:01:44,215 --> 02:01:47,342
Sell TWA to Pan Am.

1516
02:01:47,968 --> 02:01:51,095
You'll get a good price.
You'll get a fair price.

1517
02:01:52,181 --> 02:01:54,390
And then --? Then you won't go public?

1518
02:01:54,558 --> 02:01:59,395
Right. That's right. The investigation's
closed. Nobody knows a thing.

1519
02:01:59,563 --> 02:02:02,565
That's -- It's better for everybody.

1520
02:02:07,238 --> 02:02:10,782
You know, Owen,
I'm still wondering one thing.

1521
02:02:10,950 --> 02:02:14,661
- What's that?
- The picture of the llama you got last year?

1522
02:02:14,829 --> 02:02:17,497
- Yeah.
- Where'd you sail from?

1523
02:02:18,207 --> 02:02:20,250
We didn't sail. We flew.

1524
02:02:21,585 --> 02:02:23,753
- You flew?
- Yeah.

1525
02:02:31,554 --> 02:02:34,806
Are you sure you want to do this, Owen?

1526
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:38,017
You want to go to war with me?

1527
02:02:42,815 --> 02:02:47,151
It isn't me, Howard.
It's the United States government.

1528
02:02:48,112 --> 02:02:50,697
We just beat Germany and Japan.

1529
02:02:51,282 --> 02:02:53,283
Who the hell are you?

1530
02:02:58,539 --> 02:03:03,251
You -- You tell Juan Trippe
something for me, all right?

1531
02:03:03,878 --> 02:03:06,629
Tell him thanks for the flowers.

1532
02:03:07,006 --> 02:03:12,260
And he can kiss both sides of my ass.

1533
02:03:36,285 --> 02:03:38,745
Well, we have a long list of particulars.

1534
02:03:38,913 --> 02:03:43,082
Chief among them is that he defrauded
the American government ...

1535
02:03:43,250 --> 02:03:46,836
... of $56 million while at war,
when we could least afford it.

1536
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:50,006
While brave men were dying
on the beaches of Normandy ...

1537
02:03:50,174 --> 02:03:53,635
... Mr. Hughes was picking the pocket
of the American taxpayer.

1538
02:03:53,802 --> 02:03:55,136
I sleep ...

1539
02:03:55,930 --> 02:03:58,181
... in this room ...

1540
02:03:59,934 --> 02:04:01,351
... in the dark.

1541
02:04:01,518 --> 02:04:04,395
I'll have him dragged here to Washington
if I have to.

1542
02:04:04,563 --> 02:04:06,814
I wanna see the whites of his lies.

1543
02:04:07,066 --> 02:04:09,108
I have a place.

1544
02:04:09,860 --> 02:04:13,529
- I can sleep.
- He has a lot of questions to answer.

1545
02:04:13,697 --> 02:04:16,741
- I have a chair.
- Particularly about that monstrous ...

1546
02:04:16,909 --> 02:04:21,371
... boondoggle of his,
that model airplane he's building ...

1547
02:04:21,538 --> 02:04:26,167
... that flying lumberyard,
that spruce goose.

1548
02:04:27,795 --> 02:04:30,171
No, he'll -- We'll get him here.

1549
02:04:33,717 --> 02:04:35,176
That's just beautiful.

1550
02:04:36,178 --> 02:04:39,764
Oh, yeah. I like the desert.

1551
02:04:41,684 --> 02:04:45,436
It's hot there in the desert,
but it's clean.

1552
02:04:46,021 --> 02:04:47,689
It's clean.

1553
02:04:49,400 --> 02:04:51,359
I need to sleep.

1554
02:04:54,238 --> 02:05:02,912
I should drink something first.

1555
02:05:07,584 --> 02:05:09,335
Wait a minute.

1556
02:05:10,713 --> 02:05:12,255
What if that milk is sour?

1557
02:05:13,465 --> 02:05:15,091
That milk is bad.

1558
02:05:15,843 --> 02:05:20,805
I shouldn't pick up
the bottle of milk with my right hand.

1559
02:05:21,223 --> 02:05:27,478
And I shouldn't take the top off
with my left hand ...

1560
02:05:28,439 --> 02:05:31,607
... put it in my pocket.

1561
02:05:31,775 --> 02:05:34,360
My left pocket.

1562
02:05:51,128 --> 02:05:55,423
Howard, it's Kate.
I need -- I need to talk to you.

1563
02:05:56,633 --> 02:05:58,593
Can you hear me?

1564
02:06:01,055 --> 02:06:03,056
I'm coming in.

1565
02:06:07,895 --> 02:06:10,646
Howard, unlock this door immediately.

1566
02:06:19,156 --> 02:06:21,574
I can't, sweetie.

1567
02:06:24,495 --> 02:06:26,370
You mean you won't.

1568
02:06:28,248 --> 02:06:31,667
Howard, please let me see you.

1569
02:06:31,835 --> 02:06:37,006
- I haven't shaved.
- Well, neither have l.

1570
02:06:40,219 --> 02:06:42,053
Come on.

1571
02:06:42,221 --> 02:06:43,930
You ...

1572
02:06:44,098 --> 02:06:46,557
You let me in.

1573
02:06:52,272 --> 02:06:54,649
I can hear you, Katie.

1574
02:06:56,110 --> 02:07:01,614
I could always hear you.
Even in the cockpit, with the engines on.

1575
02:07:02,282 --> 02:07:05,701
That's because I'm so goddamn loud.

1576
02:07:10,457 --> 02:07:12,375
Howard, I ...

1577
02:07:14,461 --> 02:07:16,879
I came to thank you.

1578
02:07:17,714 --> 02:07:20,925
I found out what you did
for Spence and me.

1579
02:07:21,093 --> 02:07:24,387
Buying those awful pictures.

1580
02:07:29,017 --> 02:07:30,685
You love him.

1581
02:07:37,401 --> 02:07:40,069
He's everything I have.

1582
02:07:48,078 --> 02:07:50,121
Howard?

1583
02:07:51,081 --> 02:07:53,541
I'm glad for you, Kate.

1584
02:07:54,877 --> 02:07:57,295
Go away now. Would you do that?

1585
02:07:58,714 --> 02:08:01,966
- Howard, please.
- Go away.

1586
02:08:02,134 --> 02:08:05,553
Just for now. I'll see you soon.

1587
02:08:05,721 --> 02:08:08,097
- We'll go flying together.
- Yes.

1588
02:08:08,265 --> 02:08:11,142
Yes, please. You take me flying again.

1589
02:08:11,310 --> 02:08:14,145
Howard, I can take the wheel.

1590
02:08:19,985 --> 02:08:21,611
Howard?

1591
02:08:28,076 --> 02:08:30,119
Howard, are you --? Are you there?

1592
02:08:35,834 --> 02:08:37,501
Howard?

1593
02:08:39,296 --> 02:08:41,172
Howard, are you there?

1594
02:08:43,634 --> 02:08:45,676
Come on, Howard.

1595
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:50,556
Howard, are you there?

1596
02:09:16,833 --> 02:09:23,756
Come in with the milk.

1597
02:09:24,049 --> 02:09:27,093
He is to open the bag
with his right hand ...

1598
02:09:27,261 --> 02:09:30,346
... and hold the bag out to me
at a 45-degree angle ...

1599
02:09:30,514 --> 02:09:33,849
... so I may reach into the bag without ...

1600
02:09:35,894 --> 02:09:38,145
Without touching the paper.

1601
02:09:43,151 --> 02:09:50,783
Repeated from the beginning.

1602
02:10:01,211 --> 02:10:05,548
If there is any variation
of these instructions ...

1603
02:10:05,716 --> 02:10:09,051
... even to the smallest degree ...

1604
02:10:09,219 --> 02:10:13,431
... the entire process must be repeated ...

1605
02:10:13,598 --> 02:10:16,058
... from the beginning.
- Come in with the milk.

1606
02:10:16,226 --> 02:10:18,978
- Repeated from the beginning.
- Come in with the milk.

1607
02:10:19,146 --> 02:10:20,896
- Come in with the milk.
- Repeated ...

1608
02:10:21,064 --> 02:10:22,815
... from the beginning.

1609
02:10:22,983 --> 02:10:24,942
Repeated from the beginning.

1610
02:10:25,110 --> 02:10:26,819
Come in with the milk.

1611
02:10:26,987 --> 02:10:28,904
Q ...

1612
02:10:30,741 --> 02:10:32,033
R ...

1613
02:10:32,409 --> 02:10:34,493

Q ...

I ...

1627
02:11:20,499 --> 02:11:22,291
Howard?

1628
02:11:24,461 --> 02:11:26,003
Hello?

1629
02:11:28,382 --> 02:11:29,757
Who is it?

1630
02:11:29,925 --> 02:11:31,926
Howard, it's Juan.

1631
02:11:40,394 --> 02:11:42,311
Juan.

1632
02:11:42,896 --> 02:11:45,147
Juan, right. Yeah.

1633
02:11:45,315 --> 02:11:48,109
We had an appointment, right? Yeah.

1634
02:11:48,777 --> 02:11:51,237
I remember that. Look ...

1635
02:11:51,405 --> 02:11:54,198
... I got a hell of a cold in here.
A hell of a cold.

1636
02:11:54,366 --> 02:11:57,785
So take a seat out there,
because I don't wanna get you sick.

1637
02:11:58,245 --> 02:12:03,332
I'd never forgive myself if I got you sick.
I don't wanna get you sick. I don't wanna --

1638
02:12:10,507 --> 02:12:12,341
Thank you.

1639
02:12:14,928 --> 02:12:16,679
Okay, Howard, I'm sitting.

1640
02:12:17,347 --> 02:12:20,433
I've brought along our accountings.
Now ...

1641
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:23,769
... Pan Am is trading
at 13 and five-eighths.

1642
02:12:23,937 --> 02:12:26,564
TWA at four and a quarter.

1643
02:12:26,731 --> 02:12:28,190
- Now, if you take --
- Come on.

1644
02:12:28,358 --> 02:12:33,654
Come on, come on, come on.
We both know I'm not gonna sell TWA.

1645
02:12:33,822 --> 02:12:35,865
Besides, you couldn't afford her.

1646
02:12:36,032 --> 02:12:39,827
Our domestic routes alone
are worth more than twice Pan Am.

1647
02:12:40,412 --> 02:12:43,664
Well, considering our stock is trading
at three times yours ...

1648
02:12:43,832 --> 02:12:46,876
... I find that a dubious claim, Howard.

1649
02:12:47,043 --> 02:12:48,419
What I --

1650
02:12:50,547 --> 02:12:55,134
What I mean is,
you have no domestic routes. All right?

1651
02:12:55,302 --> 02:12:57,428
I mean, you get TWA,
you span the globe.

1652
02:12:57,596 --> 02:13:00,306
I'm not gonna sell,
and you know I'm not gonna sell.

1653
02:13:00,474 --> 02:13:02,349
Here's the point.

1654
02:13:02,517 --> 02:13:04,977
Owen Brewster works for you.

1655
02:13:05,562 --> 02:13:11,400
Howard, I didn't elect Senator Brewster.
We can thank the voters of Maine for that.

1656
02:13:19,075 --> 02:13:24,538
Now, if I appear at his hearings, Juan,
it could get nasty.

1657
02:13:24,706 --> 02:13:26,749
Real nasty for all of us.

1658
02:13:26,917 --> 02:13:31,253
Well, I think,
considerably more so for you.

1659
02:13:31,671 --> 02:13:34,882
While the good people of America
were losing sons at Anzio ...

1660
02:13:35,050 --> 02:13:38,761
... you produced a dirty movie
and built airplanes that don't fly.

1661
02:13:38,929 --> 02:13:41,514
Well, that's just not fair, is it?

1662
02:13:41,681 --> 02:13:45,476
I mean, the XF-11 flew quite well
for an hour and 45 minutes.

1663
02:13:45,644 --> 02:13:49,939
I wish you were up there with me, Juan.
It was exhilarating.

1664
02:13:50,899 --> 02:13:54,276
Be that as it may, you still have
to answer for the Spruce Goose.

1665
02:13:55,028 --> 02:13:57,488
It's called The Hercules!

1666
02:13:57,656 --> 02:14:00,908
And it will fly, goddamn it!

1667
02:14:01,076 --> 02:14:05,120
I hope so. The American people deserve
something for their $13 million.

1668
02:14:05,288 --> 02:14:08,290
I won't sell TWA!

1669
02:14:08,458 --> 02:14:09,625
I won't!

1670
02:14:14,631 --> 02:14:16,632
I know that, Howard.

1671
02:14:17,425 --> 02:14:19,134
I know that.

1672
02:14:20,929 --> 02:14:23,556
But I'm going to get it anyway.

1673
02:14:24,516 --> 02:14:28,394
You will default on your loan from
Equitable after Senator Brewster ...

1674
02:14:28,562 --> 02:14:32,856
... destroys your reputation and you can't
find additional capital for the airline.

1675
02:14:33,024 --> 02:14:38,237
The hearings will also show Hughes Aircraft
to be mismanaged and incompetent ...

1676
02:14:38,405 --> 02:14:40,489
... and it will go bankrupt too.

1677
02:14:40,657 --> 02:14:44,201
But you won't be insolvent.
You'll still have Tool Co.

1678
02:14:44,369 --> 02:14:48,205
Perhaps you'll head back to Houston
to rebuild your empire.

1679
02:14:48,456 --> 02:14:50,583
I rather hope you do.

1680
02:14:51,001 --> 02:14:54,336
By that time,
Pan Am will have bought TWA ...

1681
02:14:54,504 --> 02:14:58,549
... and painted all those magnificent
Connies blue and white.

1682
02:14:58,717 --> 02:15:03,596
So when you do return,
it will be on a Pan Am plane.

1683
02:15:07,017 --> 02:15:08,684
Well ...

1684
02:15:10,687 --> 02:15:13,772
You seem to have me
in a corner here, buddy.

1685
02:15:14,774 --> 02:15:17,943
Not a position in which
I'm very comfortable.

1686
02:15:19,529 --> 02:15:23,407
I think you're gonna be less comfortable
at Senator Brewster's hearings.

1687
02:15:24,534 --> 02:15:26,869
Very public, Howard.

1688
02:15:28,872 --> 02:15:32,291
Lots of cameras and newsmen.

1689
02:15:32,542 --> 02:15:36,295
I understand you're not
particularly fond of crowds.

1690
02:15:38,173 --> 02:15:41,342
Perhaps we should spare you that.

1691
02:15:43,219 --> 02:15:48,182
Well, thank you for your concern, Juan.

1692
02:15:48,350 --> 02:15:50,351
I find that ...

1693
02:15:51,478 --> 02:15:53,646
... very moving.

1694
02:15:54,397 --> 02:15:56,398
It's been a real pleasure.

1695
02:15:58,068 --> 02:16:01,153
Noah will see you back
to the airport now.

1696
02:16:02,155 --> 02:16:09,578
You fly safe.

1697
02:16:14,501 --> 02:16:17,252
Thank you, Howard,
and you take care of that cold.

1698
02:16:17,420 --> 02:16:19,338
Don't you worry.

1699
02:16:19,506 --> 02:16:21,674
I certainly will.

1700
02:16:22,592 --> 02:16:24,343
Bye-bye.

1701
02:16:29,015 --> 02:16:33,769
If you let him appear at those hearings,
the whole world will see what he's become.

1702
02:16:33,937 --> 02:16:36,855
People should remember him as he was.

1703
02:16:42,028 --> 02:16:45,531
He'll have a subpoena in three days
to appear in Washington.

1704
02:16:46,783 --> 02:16:49,368
If you can get him out of there by then.

1705
02:17:39,169 --> 02:17:41,003
Mr. Hughes?

1706
02:17:47,093 --> 02:17:49,428
I don't have any shoes.

1707
02:17:51,264 --> 02:17:54,141
- Could you get me some shoes?
- Shoes.

1708
02:17:54,893 --> 02:17:56,435
Yeah.

1709
02:18:21,836 --> 02:18:24,463
How nice of you to dress for me.

1710
02:18:27,717 --> 02:18:29,843
Can I come in?

1711
02:18:30,637 --> 02:18:35,015
Yeah, you can come in.

1712
02:18:41,856 --> 02:18:43,816
Thank you for coming.

1713
02:18:56,246 --> 02:18:58,288
Now, let's get a drink.

1714
02:18:58,456 --> 02:19:02,584
Wait, wait, wait, honey.
You can't move. You're safe here.

1715
02:19:02,752 --> 02:19:05,879
You're in the germ-free zone now.
You understand?

1716
02:19:06,047 --> 02:19:11,510
- I'll take my chances.
- No, no, honey. Wait, wait.

1717
02:19:24,607 --> 02:19:27,025
Love what you've done with the place.

1718
02:19:33,825 --> 02:19:37,911
Now, let me look at you.

1719
02:19:42,625 --> 02:19:45,043
When do you go to Washington?

1720
02:19:45,545 --> 02:19:47,462
A week.

1721
02:19:47,630 --> 02:19:50,507
No, no. Just under a week.

1722
02:19:50,675 --> 02:19:55,137
I don't know the date today,
but I have to be ...

1723
02:19:55,305 --> 02:19:57,890
All right, take it easy.

1724
02:20:10,820 --> 02:20:13,488
There's nothing there, Howard.

1725
02:20:20,413 --> 02:20:23,832
I see things.

1726
02:20:24,667 --> 02:20:26,585
I know, baby.

1727
02:20:27,712 --> 02:20:30,088
Rinse your face off, now.

1728
02:20:39,015 --> 02:20:41,516
Put your hands in the water
and wash off the soap.

1729
02:20:41,684 --> 02:20:44,937
I'm right here. I'm not going anywhere.

1730
02:20:49,359 --> 02:20:52,819
- Does that look clean to you?
- Nothing's clean, Howard.

1731
02:20:52,987 --> 02:20:55,989
But we do our best, right?

1732
02:20:56,699 --> 02:20:58,450
Yeah.

1733
02:21:17,804 --> 02:21:19,513
What do you think?

1734
02:21:19,681 --> 02:21:23,100
- Well, I look all right.
- You look great.

1735
02:21:23,267 --> 02:21:24,935
Will you marry me?

1736
02:21:25,103 --> 02:21:27,813
You're too crazy for me.

1737
02:21:29,440 --> 02:21:31,817
I gotta go, baby.

1738
02:21:32,568 --> 02:21:34,403
Okay.

1739
02:21:35,113 --> 02:21:36,822
Thanks.

1740
02:21:42,745 --> 02:21:44,997
You'd do it for me.

1741
02:21:51,379 --> 02:21:53,338
Hi, Howard. How you doing?

1742
02:22:34,130 --> 02:22:36,465
The committee will come to order.

1743
02:22:37,133 --> 02:22:41,845
Ladies and gentlemen, I must insist that
we maintain quiet during these proceedings.

1744
02:22:42,013 --> 02:22:45,265
All right, Mr. Hughes,
will you stand and be sworn?

1745
02:22:47,226 --> 02:22:51,271
Do you solemnly swear that in the matter
now pending before this committee ...

1746
02:22:51,439 --> 02:22:55,567
... you will tell the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

1747
02:22:55,735 --> 02:22:57,986
- I do.
- Pardon me for speaking loudly ...

1748
02:22:58,154 --> 02:23:02,407
... but I know you have difficulty hearing.
- That's quite all right.

1749
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:06,286
I mean, everybody knows I'm deaf.
I'm not gonna try to hide it.

1750
02:23:08,664 --> 02:23:11,333
Mr. Hughes, it is the intention
of this committee --

1751
02:23:11,501 --> 02:23:13,085
Mr. Hughes has a statement.

1752
02:23:14,420 --> 02:23:20,342
All right, you may proceed
with this statement, Mr. Hughes.

1753
02:23:26,641 --> 02:23:28,934
Mr. Hughes, do you have a statement?

1754
02:23:36,275 --> 02:23:40,529
I'm gonna attempt to be honest here.

1755
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:46,284
I mean, my reputation's being destroyed,
so I might as well lay the cards on the table.

1756
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:51,206
Senator Brewster, if you hadn't
gone too far overboard ...

1757
02:23:51,374 --> 02:23:54,042
... if you hadn't put
the red-hot iron in my side ...

1758
02:23:54,210 --> 02:23:58,713
... I might have been willing to take a
shellacking in this publicity spree of yours.

1759
02:23:58,881 --> 02:24:04,469
I may have been willing to sit back and take
a certain amount of abuse simply because ...

1760
02:24:05,221 --> 02:24:07,806
... well, I am only a private citizen.

1761
02:24:07,974 --> 02:24:10,058
Whereas you are a senator ...

1762
02:24:10,226 --> 02:24:13,145
... with all sorts of powers.

1763
02:24:13,980 --> 02:24:16,898
But I think this goddamn circus
has gone on long enough!

1764
02:24:17,066 --> 02:24:20,944
- That's quite sufficient.
- You have called me a liar, sir, in the press.

1765
02:24:21,112 --> 02:24:24,156
You have called me a liar
and a thief and a war profiteer!

1766
02:24:24,323 --> 02:24:28,285
- The witness will restrain --
- Why not tell the truth for once, senator?

1767
02:24:28,452 --> 02:24:32,914
Why not tell the truth that this investigation
was really born on the day that TWA ...

1768
02:24:33,082 --> 02:24:38,670
... decided to fly to Europe? On the day that
TWA first invaded Juan Trippe's territory!

1769
02:24:38,838 --> 02:24:41,381
- Sit down.
- On the day TWA first challenged ...

1770
02:24:41,549 --> 02:24:46,094
... the generally accepted theory that only
Juan Trippe's great Pan American Airways ...

1771
02:24:46,262 --> 02:24:50,390
... had the right to fly the Atlantic!
- You are not here to make a speech.

1772
02:24:51,392 --> 02:24:54,853
I asked for silence!
I asked for quiet in this room ...

1773
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:59,065
We have in our possession receipts
in the amount of $170,000 ...

1774
02:25:00,401 --> 02:25:04,696
... acquired from Mr. John Meyer.
Mr. Meyer works for you, does he not?

1775
02:25:04,864 --> 02:25:09,034
- He does.
- And what is his official title?

1776
02:25:09,952 --> 02:25:13,496
I don't exactly know, senator.
A lot of people work for me.

1777
02:25:13,664 --> 02:25:16,458
Can you explain why your press agent
would pay out ...

1778
02:25:16,626 --> 02:25:21,630
... more than $170,000 to representatives
of the United States Air Force?

1779
02:25:21,797 --> 02:25:26,259
- I don't know. You'd have to ask him.
- Well, would you produce him?

1780
02:25:27,136 --> 02:25:30,305
- Produce him?
- Will you cause him to appear?

1781
02:25:30,473 --> 02:25:33,725
You had John Meyer on the stand
for three days last week.

1782
02:25:33,893 --> 02:25:36,645
Be that as it may,
we would like him to reappear.

1783
02:25:36,812 --> 02:25:40,315
Would you ask him to return?

1784
02:25:46,322 --> 02:25:48,573
No, I don't think I will.

1785
02:25:50,201 --> 02:25:53,411
Will you try to have him return?

1786
02:25:55,498 --> 02:25:59,960
- No, I don't think I'll try.
- You don't think you'll try?

1787
02:26:01,003 --> 02:26:04,005
No, I don't think so.

1788
02:26:04,173 --> 02:26:09,010
The $170,000 paid out to the Air Force
in the form of hotel suites ...

1789
02:26:09,178 --> 02:26:10,804
... TWA stock ...

1790
02:26:11,472 --> 02:26:13,932
... female companionship.

1791
02:26:14,141 --> 02:26:18,436
Now, is it possible that
these could be considered bribes?

1792
02:26:19,105 --> 02:26:21,439
I suppose you could call them that, yes.

1793
02:26:22,817 --> 02:26:24,192
Would you repeat that?

1794
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:28,989
I said, I suppose you could
consider them bribes, yes.

1795
02:26:31,617 --> 02:26:34,452
Well, would you like
to explain that, Mr. Hughes?

1796
02:26:36,163 --> 02:26:40,375
I'm afraid you don't know how
the aviation business works, senator.

1797
02:26:40,543 --> 02:26:44,963
See, wining and dining Air Force dignitaries
is common in our business.

1798
02:26:45,131 --> 02:26:50,051
It's because we all want the big contracts.
All the major aircraft companies do it.

1799
02:26:50,219 --> 02:26:52,387
I don't know whether
it's a good system ...

1800
02:26:52,555 --> 02:26:56,808
... I just know it's not illegal.
You, senator, you are the lawmaker.

1801
02:26:56,976 --> 02:27:01,563
If you pass a law that states no one
can entertain Air Force officers, well, hell ...

1802
02:27:01,731 --> 02:27:03,898
... I'd be happy to abide by it.

1803
02:27:05,985 --> 02:27:09,404
Your story is a pack of lies. I can
tear it apart if allowed to cross-examine.

1804
02:27:10,740 --> 02:27:15,035
- We're not gonna have this bickering.
- Yes. Somewhere between two and 500 ...

1805
02:27:15,202 --> 02:27:19,080
... if you'll let me get started.
- If you believe your wealth and power ...

1806
02:27:19,248 --> 02:27:23,209
... can intimidate any member
of this committee, you're mistaken.

1807
02:27:23,377 --> 02:27:26,254
- Now submit your questions.
- I'll put this very simply.

1808
02:27:26,422 --> 02:27:29,466
On February 12th,
at the Mayflower Hotel ...

1809
02:27:29,633 --> 02:27:35,263
... did you or did you not tell me
that if I were to sell TWA to Pan Am ...

1810
02:27:35,431 --> 02:27:38,224
... that this entire investigation
would be called off?

1811
02:27:38,392 --> 02:27:42,103
I did not. And I have asked you
to submit your questions in writing.

1812
02:27:42,271 --> 02:27:46,232
- How long have you known Juan Trippe?
- I've known him for some time now.

1813
02:27:46,400 --> 02:27:51,112
- And that's not the question.
- Is it not true that Juan donated $20,000 ...

1814
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,533
... to your last campaign? I mean,
he spoke to me as if you worked for him.

1815
02:27:59,580 --> 02:28:01,456
I have a personal friendship with --

1816
02:28:01,624 --> 02:28:05,043
Is it true you accept free Pan Am tickets
to circle the globe ...

1817
02:28:05,211 --> 02:28:08,129
... in support of your C.A.B. bill?
- No, it is not true.

1818
02:28:08,297 --> 02:28:12,509
Well, who wrote that bill, senator?
Who actually wrote the C.A.B. bill?

1819
02:28:12,676 --> 02:28:16,638
- The actual words. Did you write them?
- This is not how these hearings ...

1820
02:28:16,806 --> 02:28:20,892
... are gonna be conducted.
- I have it. Maybe it'll refresh your memory.

1821
02:28:21,060 --> 02:28:25,647
"Bill S-987 to amend
the Civil Aeronautics Act."

1822
02:28:25,815 --> 02:28:28,650
Now, you introduced this bill
to the Senate.

1823
02:28:31,112 --> 02:28:33,238
A lot of words.

1824
02:28:33,572 --> 02:28:35,573
You write all of them?

1825
02:28:36,158 --> 02:28:39,035
- Did you write any of them, senator?
- Now, look --

1826
02:28:39,203 --> 02:28:42,205
Now, this entire bill was written
by Pan Am executives ...

1827
02:28:42,373 --> 02:28:46,668
... and designed to give that airline
a monopoly on international travel.

1828
02:28:46,836 --> 02:28:51,297
You've been flogging this bill all around
the world on their behalf, have you not?

1829
02:28:51,465 --> 02:28:55,218
I have duties that take me
all over the world, Mr. Hughes.

1830
02:28:55,386 --> 02:29:00,432
Well, what the hell does a senator
from Maine need to visit Peru for?

1831
02:29:01,183 --> 02:29:05,854
I was seeking outlets for our trade goods.

1832
02:29:06,814 --> 02:29:09,774
Buy a lot of lobsters down there, do they?

1833
02:29:12,361 --> 02:29:16,156
Senator, how many times have you visited
Trippe's office in New York ...

1834
02:29:16,323 --> 02:29:18,700
... in the last three months?

1835
02:29:21,287 --> 02:29:24,038
Would you like me to tell you, senator?

1836
02:29:24,790 --> 02:29:28,251
All right, this has gone on long enough.
Juan is a great American.

1837
02:29:28,419 --> 02:29:32,797
His airline has advanced the cause
of commercial aviation for decades.

1838
02:29:32,965 --> 02:29:38,511
Juan Trippe is a patriot. Juan Trippe is not
a man who is interested in making money.

1839
02:29:39,388 --> 02:29:43,183
Well, I'm sure his stockholders
would be happy to hear that.

1840
02:29:44,852 --> 02:29:46,352
We're gonna clear this room.

1841
02:29:46,896 --> 02:29:51,691
This is James McNamara speaking to you
from the Hughes 2000-ton flying boat ...

1842
02:29:51,859 --> 02:29:55,028
... the world's largest aircraft.
This is the sky giant ...

1843
02:29:55,196 --> 02:29:59,282
... which has prompted Congress to
investigate the war contracts of Mr. Hughes.

1844
02:29:59,450 --> 02:30:03,036
Before boarding the craft,
Mr. Hughes told newsmen that this test ...

1845
02:30:03,204 --> 02:30:07,415
... would be solely a taxi experiment.
He said he didn't know what might happen.

1846
02:30:07,583 --> 02:30:09,459
The mammoth flying plywood shell ...

1847
02:30:11,545 --> 02:30:15,298
... might ship water under high-speed
taxi pressure. He will not take ...

1848
02:30:15,466 --> 02:30:18,760
... the craft into the air until next spring.
The thin man from Culver City ...

1849
02:30:18,928 --> 02:30:23,431
... pronounced the craft an unknown
quantity. He has an idea what it can do ...

1850
02:30:23,599 --> 02:30:25,600
None of that, now. None of that.

1851
02:30:25,768 --> 02:30:28,686
We are about 5 feet
in back of Mr. Hughes.

1852
02:30:28,854 --> 02:30:32,232
We are looking through
one of the side windows in the cockpit.

1853
02:30:32,399 --> 02:30:34,943
Professor, why don't you
come on up front here.

1854
02:30:35,361 --> 02:30:38,613
In other words, we are 30 feet high
in this aircraft.

1855
02:30:38,781 --> 02:30:43,409
Strap yourself in right there.
You ought to be able to see just great.

1856
02:30:44,411 --> 02:30:47,664
Huge crowds jam the surrounding
shoreline this morning.

1857
02:30:47,831 --> 02:30:51,042
All right, boys, let's fire it up.

1858
02:30:54,922 --> 02:30:56,297
One's good.

1859
02:30:57,550 --> 02:30:59,509
Two's good.

1860
02:30:59,677 --> 02:31:01,386
Three's good.

1861
02:31:01,554 --> 02:31:03,596
Four's good.

1862
02:31:03,764 --> 02:31:05,473
Five's good.

1863
02:31:05,641 --> 02:31:07,141
Six is good.

1864
02:31:07,309 --> 02:31:08,643
Seven's good.

1865
02:31:08,811 --> 02:31:10,728
Eight's good.

1866
02:31:11,814 --> 02:31:15,650
- Advancing master throttles.
- Advancing master throttles.

1867
02:31:17,278 --> 02:31:19,988
As you probably know,
I have to do a great deal ...

1868
02:31:20,155 --> 02:31:22,282
... of screaming into our microphone.

1869
02:31:22,449 --> 02:31:26,828
- Understood. Lower it 15 degrees of flaps.
- Lowering 15 degrees of flaps.

1870
02:31:27,496 --> 02:31:31,249
Howard, she's gotta hit 70
to have any kind of chance.

1871
02:31:31,417 --> 02:31:33,668
Yeah, I know. I know.

1872
02:31:33,836 --> 02:31:38,172
It's a beautiful day here off the coast
of Southern California. Blue skies ...

1873
02:31:38,340 --> 02:31:41,843
... a warm sun ...
- Twenty-five miles per hour.

1874
02:31:42,011 --> 02:31:44,262
- And a relatively calm sea ...
- Thirty.

1875
02:31:45,889 --> 02:31:47,181
Thirty-five.

1876
02:31:47,349 --> 02:31:51,311
One would think these eight power plants
might shake the craft to pieces ...

1877
02:31:51,687 --> 02:31:53,271
Take it easy, Howard.

1878
02:31:55,566 --> 02:31:59,360
- Forty!
- Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1879
02:31:59,528 --> 02:32:01,863
Throttling back for starboard turn 180.

1880
02:32:07,119 --> 02:32:09,621
The flight crew itself
consists of four men.

1881
02:32:09,788 --> 02:32:13,833
Mr. Hughes, however, has added 11
maintenance men to this maiden taxi test ...

1882
02:32:14,001 --> 02:32:19,631
... stationed at various places throughout the
ship, checking points of stress and strain.

1883
02:32:22,051 --> 02:32:23,718
How does she sound, Odie?

1884
02:32:24,637 --> 02:32:26,638
Sounds good, Howard.

1885
02:32:29,933 --> 02:32:32,060
- Professor.
- Yes?

1886
02:32:32,227 --> 02:32:34,145
Would you do me a favor?

1887
02:32:34,605 --> 02:32:38,650
Would you take a look out that window
and tell me what the wind is doing?

1888
02:32:43,697 --> 02:32:48,034
I would say that we have a 15-knot wind.

1889
02:32:48,202 --> 02:32:51,579
Would you call that a headwind,
professor?

1890
02:32:52,289 --> 02:32:54,499
I would, Mr. Hughes.

1891
02:32:54,667 --> 02:32:58,252
We must maintain silence. We must
have quiet during the proceedings.

1892
02:32:58,420 --> 02:33:00,755
Mr. Hughes, will you stand and be sworn?

1893
02:33:00,923 --> 02:33:03,383
Mr. Hughes, did you receive ...

1894
02:33:03,550 --> 02:33:09,931
... $43 million to manufacture 100 XF-11
spy planes for the United States Air Force?

1895
02:33:11,183 --> 02:33:12,350
I did.

1896
02:33:12,643 --> 02:33:16,771
How many functional planes did you
deliver to the United States Air Force?

1897
02:33:17,106 --> 02:33:18,106
None.

1898
02:33:18,273 --> 02:33:21,526
Would you lean a little closer
to the microphones, sir?

1899
02:33:22,027 --> 02:33:23,194
None.

1900
02:33:23,362 --> 02:33:27,281
Did you receive $13 million
to manufacture ...

1901
02:33:27,449 --> 02:33:32,245
... a prototype of a flying boat
known as The Hercules?

1902
02:33:33,789 --> 02:33:35,081
I did.

1903
02:33:35,249 --> 02:33:37,834
And did you deliver that plane?

1904
02:33:38,127 --> 02:33:39,419
I did not.

1905
02:33:40,504 --> 02:33:43,798
So by your admission
in this chamber, Mr. Hughes ...

1906
02:33:43,966 --> 02:33:46,884
... you have received $56 million ...

1907
02:33:47,261 --> 02:33:51,472
... from the United States government
for planes you never delivered.

1908
02:33:52,307 --> 02:33:54,100
That is correct.

1909
02:33:56,520 --> 02:33:59,522
Well, excuse me for asking,
Mr. Hughes ...

1910
02:33:59,690 --> 02:34:01,649
... but where did all that money go?

1911
02:34:02,025 --> 02:34:06,571
Well, it went into the planes, senator.
And a lot more.

1912
02:34:06,739 --> 02:34:11,534
More? Do tell, Mr. Hughes,
what other larcenies did you commit?

1913
02:34:11,744 --> 02:34:16,998
I mean, I put my money
into the planes, senator. My money.

1914
02:34:19,501 --> 02:34:24,046
- See, the thing is that I care --
- Your personal finances are not --

1915
02:34:24,214 --> 02:34:26,924
Let him speak.

1916
02:34:30,262 --> 02:34:31,596
Proceed, Mr. Hughes.

1917
02:34:33,682 --> 02:34:39,020
See, the thing is,
I care very much about aviation.

1918
02:34:39,271 --> 02:34:43,941
It has been the great joy of my life. That's
why I put my own money into these planes.

1919
02:34:44,109 --> 02:34:48,529
And I've lost millions, senator,
and I'll go on losing millions. It's just ...

1920
02:34:48,697 --> 02:34:50,615
... what I do.

1921
02:34:50,949 --> 02:34:55,286
Now, if I've lost a lot of the government's
money during the war, I hope folks ...

1922
02:34:55,454 --> 02:34:58,039
... will put that into perspective.

1923
02:34:58,207 --> 02:35:01,542
More than 60 other airplanes ordered
from such firms as ...

1924
02:35:01,710 --> 02:35:05,713
... Lockheed, Douglas, Northrop and Boeing
never saw action either.

1925
02:35:05,881 --> 02:35:12,386
In all, more than $800 million was spent
during the war on planes that never flew.

1926
02:35:12,554 --> 02:35:17,683
Over 6 billion on other weapons
that were never delivered.

1927
02:35:17,851 --> 02:35:22,313
Yet Hughes Aircraft, with her 56 million ...

1928
02:35:22,481 --> 02:35:24,982
... is the only firm
under investigation here.

1929
02:35:25,150 --> 02:35:30,738
I cannot help but think that has a little more
to do with TWA than planes that did not fly.

1930
02:35:30,906 --> 02:35:34,867
- You've made your point, Mr. Hughes.
- One second. I have one more thing ...

1931
02:35:35,244 --> 02:35:37,495
... to say here to this committee.

1932
02:35:37,663 --> 02:35:40,206
And that has to do with The Hercules.

1933
02:35:40,833 --> 02:35:46,087
Now, I am supposed to be many things
which are not complimentary.

1934
02:35:46,255 --> 02:35:48,297
I am supposed to be capricious.

1935
02:35:48,465 --> 02:35:52,426
I have been called a playboy.
I've even been called an eccentric ...

1936
02:35:52,594 --> 02:35:56,848
... but I do not believe that I have
the reputation of being a liar.

1937
02:35:57,808 --> 02:36:01,185
Needless to say, The Hercules
was a monumental undertaking.

1938
02:36:01,353 --> 02:36:04,063
It is the largest plane ever built.

1939
02:36:04,231 --> 02:36:08,109
It is over five stories tall with a wingspan
longer than a football field.

1940
02:36:08,277 --> 02:36:10,111
That's more than a city block.

1941
02:36:10,279 --> 02:36:14,824
Now, I put the sweat of my life into this.
I got my reputation all rolled up in it.

1942
02:36:14,992 --> 02:36:18,452
I have stated several times
that if The Hercules fails to fly ...

1943
02:36:18,620 --> 02:36:22,748
... I will leave this country
and never come back. And I mean it.

1944
02:36:24,126 --> 02:36:27,962
Now, Senator Brewster,
you can subpoena me ...

1945
02:36:28,130 --> 02:36:32,967
... you can arrest me, you can even claim
I've folded up and taken a run-out powder ...

1946
02:36:33,135 --> 02:36:38,139
... but, well, I've had just about enough
of this nonsense. Good afternoon.

1947
02:36:38,557 --> 02:36:39,807
I had to do it.

1948
02:36:39,975 --> 02:36:43,936
- Mr. Hughes.
- Mr. Hughes.

1949
02:36:44,104 --> 02:36:46,647
I'd love to see The Hercules in the air.

1950
02:36:46,815 --> 02:36:49,233
Thank you, thank you so much.

1951
02:36:58,243 --> 02:36:59,327
Switch it off.

1952
02:36:59,494 --> 02:37:02,330
- The hearings aren't over yet.
- The hearings are over.

1953
02:37:05,042 --> 02:37:07,877
The airline bill will be defeated
in the Senate.

1954
02:37:08,045 --> 02:37:11,130
TWA will begin flights from
New York to Paris ...

1955
02:37:11,298 --> 02:37:17,094
... then on to Moscow, to Japan,
to Hawaii, to Los Angeles ...

1956
02:37:19,222 --> 02:37:21,265
... to New York.

1957
02:37:25,103 --> 02:37:26,771
Fuck.

1958
02:37:30,817 --> 02:37:34,654
- Power coming up.
- Power coming up.

1959
02:37:37,950 --> 02:37:40,201
Howard Hughes has just alerted us.

1960
02:37:40,369 --> 02:37:44,956
He has asked everyone to hold on.
Tremendous horsepower kicking up.

1961
02:37:46,541 --> 02:37:47,667
Let me hear it, Odie.

1962
02:37:47,834 --> 02:37:49,877
Twenty-five miles per hour.

1963
02:37:50,462 --> 02:37:51,712
Thirty.

1964
02:37:52,047 --> 02:37:54,256
Here we go. Here we go.

1965
02:37:54,424 --> 02:37:56,592
- Thirty-five.
- The air-speed indicator ...

1966
02:37:56,760 --> 02:38:00,388
... has moved up to 25. Thirty.

1967
02:38:00,806 --> 02:38:02,890
- Thirty-five.
- Forty.

1968
02:38:03,058 --> 02:38:04,892
As he pushes the throttle it's 40.

1969
02:38:05,060 --> 02:38:08,354
- Forty-five.
- Forty-five. More throttle.

1970
02:38:08,522 --> 02:38:10,523
- Forty-five.
- Fifty.

1971
02:38:11,108 --> 02:38:13,567
- It's 50 over a choppy sea.
- Fifty-five.

1972
02:38:13,735 --> 02:38:16,070
It's 55. It's 55.

1973
02:38:16,571 --> 02:38:18,739
- Sixty.
- More throttle. It's 60.

1974
02:38:18,907 --> 02:38:20,658
- Sixty-five.
- Sixty-five.

1975
02:38:25,330 --> 02:38:27,248
- Seventy.
- It's 70.

1976
02:38:27,416 --> 02:38:30,167
- Seventy-five.
- It's 75.

1977
02:38:37,551 --> 02:38:42,847
And something momentarily cuts out.
I believe we are airborne.

1978
02:38:43,015 --> 02:38:46,600
We are airborne, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't believe that Hughes ...

1979
02:38:46,768 --> 02:38:49,520
... meant this to be. I don't know.

1980
02:38:51,732 --> 02:38:57,111
And we were really up in the air.
We were really up in the air.

1981
02:39:01,533 --> 02:39:04,952
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Hughes mammoth aircraft ...

1982
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:09,623
... has flown this afternoon
in Los Angeles Harbor.

1983
02:39:09,791 --> 02:39:14,003
Well, it certainly looks at this moment
that Howard Hughes will be around ...

1984
02:39:14,171 --> 02:39:18,049
... the United States for quite
some time to come.

1985
02:39:29,102 --> 02:39:33,147
We must understand that technologies
like these are the way of the future.

1986
02:39:33,315 --> 02:39:36,859
- That's enough questions.
- TWA and Hughes Aircraft are delighted ...

1987
02:39:37,027 --> 02:39:40,321
... to have you come here
and witness this wonderful sight.

1988
02:39:40,489 --> 02:39:42,656
- Excuse us for just a second.
- All right.

1989
02:39:42,824 --> 02:39:44,825
- So you feel like going to Paris?
- Now?

1990
02:39:44,993 --> 02:39:46,994
TWA is starting up flights to Europe.

1991
02:39:47,162 --> 02:39:50,623
I thought I might pilot the first one.
Ought to be some fun.

1992
02:39:50,791 --> 02:39:53,501
- Lots of shopping in Paris.
- I'll buy you anything.

1993
02:39:53,668 --> 02:39:56,587
You can buy me dinner. How about that?

1994
02:39:58,840 --> 02:40:01,258
Dinner, then. We got a date?

1995
02:40:01,468 --> 02:40:03,803
Okay, baby, you got a date.

1996
02:40:05,430 --> 02:40:09,225
I'll be back in a second,
but don't you go anywhere, now. I mean it.

1997
02:40:09,392 --> 02:40:12,394
All right, listen, boys.
Something new. Jet airplanes.

1998
02:40:12,562 --> 02:40:15,523
- You know about jets?
- No, but it sounds expensive.

1999
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:18,109
Oh, it will be, but we gotta get started.

2000
02:40:19,361 --> 02:40:22,154
Come on, walk with me.

2001
02:40:22,322 --> 02:40:24,657
Whoever can start utilizing
jet technology ...

2002
02:40:24,825 --> 02:40:28,702
... on commercial airliners is gonna win.
What do you know about the science?

2003
02:40:28,870 --> 02:40:33,332
I know a little. I can work something
to show you. Basic turbine stuff.

2004
02:40:37,963 --> 02:40:41,799
Noah, who are those fellas?

2005
02:40:42,717 --> 02:40:44,510
Do they work for me?

2006
02:40:45,846 --> 02:40:48,139
Everybody works for you, Howard.

2007
02:40:54,896 --> 02:40:59,608
Lockheed worked on the F-80. Let's get
Bob Gross and see if he can help us out.

2008
02:40:59,776 --> 02:41:02,069
- What, now?
- Of course now.

2009
02:41:02,237 --> 02:41:05,197
We gotta get into it.
Jets are the way of the future.

2010
02:41:05,365 --> 02:41:08,576
- It's 4:30.
- I talked to Bob last week. He's in New York.

2011
02:41:08,743 --> 02:41:11,370
- So it's 7:30.
- He won't be in the office.

2012
02:41:11,538 --> 02:41:14,748
We'll figure out what hotel he's at.
Do you want a call ...

2013
02:41:14,916 --> 02:41:18,419
... or you want some kind of meeting?
- We want a meeting, don't we?

2014
02:41:18,587 --> 02:41:21,839
Do you want me bring him
out here tomorrow, then, Howard?

2015
02:41:22,841 --> 02:41:25,259
- The way of the future.
- Howard?

2016
02:41:25,427 --> 02:41:27,178
- Howard?
- The way of the future.

2017
02:41:28,680 --> 02:41:31,432
- The way of the future.
- Let's take a walk, Howard.

2018
02:41:31,600 --> 02:41:33,517
- Way of the future.
- Give me a hand.

2019
02:41:33,685 --> 02:41:50,284
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2020
02:41:50,452 --> 02:41:54,413
All right, stay here. I'll be right back.
You understand, Howard?

2021
02:41:54,581 --> 02:41:56,332
The way of the future.

2022
02:41:56,499 --> 02:42:00,127
Guard the door. I'll get a doctor.
No one sees him like this.

2023
02:42:00,295 --> 02:42:08,469
The way of the future.
The way of the future.

2024
02:42:12,599 --> 02:42:14,391
The way of the future.

2025
02:42:20,649 --> 02:42:22,691
You are not safe.

2026
02:42:31,201 --> 02:42:32,451
When I grow up ...

2027
02:42:32,994 --> 02:42:35,996
... I'm gonna fly the fastest planes
ever built ...

2028
02:42:36,164 --> 02:42:38,749
... make the biggest movies ever ...

2029
02:42:38,917 --> 02:42:41,835
... and be the richest man in the world.

2030
02:42:55,100 --> 02:43:29,883
The way of the future.
