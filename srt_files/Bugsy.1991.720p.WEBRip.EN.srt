That's for summer, and, Jerry,

115
00:05:59,927 --> 00:06:02,262
I don't think you have
to worry about summer.

116
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:04,264
Oh, Ben, no, don't.

the key to knocking off Jack Dragna

and taking over the
Southern California rackets

121
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,629
is to come in smooth.

122
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,998
Approach him like all we want

123
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,000
is to come in as a partner.

124
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,035
He's been running
the California rackets

125
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,438
for 20 years with no competition.

126
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,940
Except for Mickey Cohen
who's a one-man gang.

127
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,811
So the only way to move in
on Dragna is amiably.

128
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,714

and nightclubs?

129

What do you think, Joey?

134
00:07:03,056 --> 00:07:07,360
Jack's a cold-blooded killer,
so you got to be very careful.

135
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:10,864
Just don't say nothing
that he'd take offense at.

136
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,232
What are you smiling at?

137
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:13,967
Nothing.

than Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

144

to be quick and quiet.

145
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:37,725
And amiable.

00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,056
to forget that this ever happened.

184
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,524
I owe you my life, Ben.

185
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:19,627
I'd say that's a fair assessment.

186
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:21,094
God bless you, Ben.

187
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:22,930
Bend your knees, Harry.

188
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:24,765
Bend my knees?

189
00:09:24,865 --> 00:09:26,734
When you jump from the train,

190
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,402
bend your knees to soften the impact.

191
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:31,038
Bend my knees.

192
00:09:31,138 --> 00:09:32,940
Okay, Ben.

193
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,642
Sure thing.

194
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,428
Are you who I think you are?

195
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:56,797
Yes, I am.

196
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,031
Let me have your autograph.

197
00:09:58,131 --> 00:09:59,733
( WOMEN SCREAMING )

198
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,069
Raye? Here you go, Raye.

199
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:04,705
Okay. We'll get everybody here.

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,776
This has been four
of the most wonderful days

201
00:10:08,876 --> 00:10:10,577
I've ever spent.

202
00:10:10,678 --> 00:10:13,346
A lot of it was
in the motion of the train.

203
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,149
Ben.

204
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:17,517
Hey.

205
00:10:17,718 --> 00:10:19,853
WOMAN:
Oh, my gosh.

206
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,421
Mister, he knows you.

207
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,956
Are you somebody too?

208
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:23,991
Nah, nah.

209
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,325
I love you, George.

210
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,894
Ben, you're looking great.

211
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:28,595
Like a million bucks of real money.

212
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:32,532
You're looking pretty good
yourself, Georgie-boy.

213
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,935
Well, that's
what they pay me for.

214
00:10:35,035 --> 00:10:37,404
We're moving on here.

215
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,240
GEORGE: Look, I've got you registered
at the Beverly Hills Hotel,

216
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,641
bungalow five.

217
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:45,145
I know you said four days,
but I reserved six.

218
00:10:48,248 --> 00:10:51,318
BEN:
Jack Dragna's the kingpin, huh?

219
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:53,053
What do you hear about him?

220
00:10:53,153 --> 00:10:56,089
GEORGE:
I hear he runs a nice, little operation.

221
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,225
You got a city with three million people

222
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,560
and he runs an operation
that's nice and little?

223
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,230
Less to worry about.
I'll drop you at the hotel.

224
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,932
I got to go the studio.

225
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:06,734
Why don't I go with you?

226
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,969
All right, if you like.

227
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:12,372
GEORGE:
Hank ain't very bright, but he's my friend

228
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,008
and if's he's hooked
into a dame like you

229
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:16,143
he's got headaches.

230
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:18,345
WOMAN:
You got the blueprints

231
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:20,247
all drawn, haven't you?

232
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,381
New cigarette.

233
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:23,216
She's eaten a whole cigarette.

234
00:11:23,316 --> 00:11:24,918
MAN:
Scene 36, take two.

235
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,587
GEORGE:
Forget that you ever seen him.

236
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,823
This might give you
an idea what I mean.

237
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,159
WOMAN:
Stick that money back to your pocket.

238
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,894
Buy yourself some manners.

239
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:36,063
For what?
To waste on you?

240
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,597
MAN:
Marker.

241
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:41,034
GEORGE:
Two bucks? For what? Some phony champagne?

242
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,235
MAN:
That's right, friend.

243
00:11:42,335 --> 00:11:44,637
Here's half a buck.
Split it between you.

244
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,807
MAN:
Take five. Marker.

245
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:47,975
Two bucks?

246
00:11:48,075 --> 00:11:50,677
For what?
Some phony champagne?

247
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:53,313
Here's half a buck.
Split it between you.

248
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,883
You are so cheap, you are wholesale.

249
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:59,853
Don't forget, mister,
I asked you nice.

250
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:01,855
MAN:
Marker.

251
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:02,890
Quiet, please.

252
00:12:04,324 --> 00:12:05,926
Reset. Let's go.

253
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:08,996
Benny, you want to hit somebody
with the chair?

254
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,935
MAN:
Manpower, scene 38. Take eight. Marker.

255
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,404
With this, I can hit
home runs all night.

256
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,008
Here. Take this

257
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,642
in case I come back.

258
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:23,777
MAN:
Let's go again.

259
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:26,346
I feel like I should say something.

260
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:29,316
MAN:
Honey, he's the star. Let's go.

261
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,689
BEN:
That was pretty impressive, Georgie-boy.

262
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,926
Well, Benny, I'm a pro.

263
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,894
You sure are.

264
00:12:43,964 --> 00:12:46,800
May I?

265
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,201
If you want a simple yes or no

266
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:50,337
you're going to have
to finish the question.

267
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,039
Light your cigarette.

268
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,041
Sure.

269
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,351
The way you were staring
I thought you were going to ask

270
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:06,353
for something exciting.

271
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:07,454
Like what?

272
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:09,456
Use your imagination.

273
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,691
I'm using it.

274
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,862
Let me know when you're finished.

275
00:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,073
Now you're going to tell me
she's a bit player?

276
00:13:26,173 --> 00:13:29,309
Flamingo? Not to Joey Adonis.

277
00:13:29,409 --> 00:13:30,410
That's Virginia Hill.

278
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,380
BEN:
Yeah? That's Flamingo.

279
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,082
Don't get no ideas.

280
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,816
You know how crazy Joey can get.

281
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,651
No woman's worth a bullet
between the eyes.

282
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:39,920
Am I right?

283
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,821
Depends on whose eyes
and which woman.

284
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:50,530
Look, you're Ben Siegel
and I'm Virginia Hill.

285
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,099
Why are you so interested
in a gal

286
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:53,967
who's going with your friend?

287
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,903
Joey A? He's no friend.

288
00:13:56,003 --> 00:13:57,370
He's an associate of an associate.

289
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,838
Are you still going with him?

290
00:13:58,939 --> 00:14:01,541
If it were new year's eve,
he would be my date.

291
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,410
Who would your date be?

292
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,577
Wife.

293
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,645
Wife?

294
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,646
Esta.

295
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,680
Esther?

296
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,182
Esta. E-S-T-A.

297
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:14,787
I'll bet Esta lives her life
faithful to her one and only Ben

298
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:16,890
who plays around
like a jackrabbit on the side

299
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,758
and lies about it through his teeth.

300
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,460
I don't lie to Esta.

301
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,761
That's noble.

302
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,898
Do you confess your sins
three times a day?

303
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,403
Now what exactly does Mr. Esta
want from Miss Virginia?

304
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,276
Mr. Esta is having a tremendous
amount of difficulty

305
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,012
imagining anything he doesn't
want from Miss Virginia.

306
00:14:39,112 --> 00:14:41,381
Are you ready for a divorce?

307
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,916
Never.

308
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:47,487
Wow. You're pretty ferocious
where mom's concerned.

309
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,922
The rest of the time

310
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,124
you're just another sweet-talking,

311
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,659
charm-oozing, fuck-happy fellow

312
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,494
with nothing to offer but some dialogue.

313
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,796
Dialogue's cheap
in Hollywood, Ben.

314
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,400
Why don't you run outside
and jerk yourself a soda?

315
00:15:14,982 --> 00:15:17,084
BEN:
Georgie, let me ask you

316
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:20,453
how would someone go about
getting a screen test?

317
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,322
You know somebody
that wants a screen test?

318
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,493
No, I just thought that if
it came up in a conversation...

319
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:28,295
What about Virginia Hill?

320
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,730
You think she's got
a future in movies?

321
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,067
I don't know if I've got
a future in movies.

322
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,535
Lana Turner lives there.

323
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:37,437
Cesar Romero

324
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:38,671
lives there.

325
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,110
And Gary Cooper is in that house.

326
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:45,112
He paid $45,000.

327
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:47,147
Houses are bringing that kind
of money out here?

328
00:15:47,247 --> 00:15:48,715
Sure, and more.

329
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,150
Whose is that?

330
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,552
Lawrence... What's-his-name--
the opera singer.

331
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:54,054
BEN:
Melchior?

332
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:57,524
-No, the other guy--
-what's-his-name.

333
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:59,126
Lawrence Tibbett?

334
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:00,360
Stop.

335
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,129
What are you doing?

336
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,097
Paying my respects.

337
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,974
Yes?

338
00:16:15,075 --> 00:16:16,543
I'm looking for Lawrence Tibbett.

339
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,245
He's in the study.

340
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,346
Who's calling?

341
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,547
Ben Siegel.

342
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,548
Is he expecting you?

343
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,116
Not unless he's psychic.

344
00:16:23,216 --> 00:16:29,689
Oh, well, uh, would you
excuse me for a moment, please?

345
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,497
Georgie, how far
is your house from here?

346
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:38,898
Half a mile.

347
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,501
Benny, what the hell are you doing?

348
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:48,975
Mr. Siegel?

349
00:16:49,076 --> 00:16:53,380
Lawrence Tibbett, what an honor
and a thrill it is to meet you.

350
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,316
I took my wife and daughters

351
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,285
to hear you sing rigeletto last year.

352
00:16:58,385 --> 00:17:00,753
It was one of the great evenings
of our lives.

353
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:02,822
You overwhelm me, Mr. Siegel.

354
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,158
-Ben.
-Ben?

355
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:06,926
Ben Siegel?

356
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:11,231
You wouldn't be related
to Bugsy Siegel, would you?

357
00:17:11,331 --> 00:17:13,266
What do you mean "Bugsy"?

358
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:15,102
I beg your pardon.

359
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,937
A bug is nothing.
The word has no meaning.

360
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,706
It's used out of ignorance or malice.

361
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,808
A bug is a colloquialism.

362
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:25,745
Insects include a variety
of living creatures.

363
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,614
They fly. They crawl.
They do many things.

364
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:30,483
None of them can be called a bug!

365
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,487
I certainly didn't mean
any offense, Mr. S-Siegel.

366
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:35,955
Ben.

367
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,590
Mind if I look around, Larry?

368
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,092
Be my guest.

369
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,993
You don't mind if I
call you Larry, do you?

370
00:17:41,094 --> 00:17:44,497
All my friends call me Larry.

371
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:47,934
What brings you
to Los Angeles, B-B-Ben?

372
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,502
Curiosity.

373
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,504
This is a wonderful house.

374
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,175
What do you think
of the Beverly Hills Hotel?

375
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:57,710
It's the best hotel in town.
Is that where you're staying?

376
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,247
Do you prefer the bungalows
or the suites?

377
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:02,615
The bungalows.
Which one do you have?

378
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,319
I don't-- you do.
Bungalow five.

379
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:07,554
I don't understand.

380
00:18:07,654 --> 00:18:09,489
I'm buying this house from you.

381
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,458
This house isn't for sale.

382
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:13,193
Sure it is.

383
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,195
Everything's for sale.

384
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,729
How much do you want?

385
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:18,598
Mr. Siegel...

386
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,900
Ben.

387
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:22,269
Ben.

388
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,871
Why are you looking at me like that?

389
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:25,905
Like what?

390
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,507
Are you going to hurt me?

391
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:30,042
Hurt you?

392
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,812
I would protect you from anyone
who tried to hurt you.

393
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:35,782
I revere you. Your voice
makes life justifiable.

394
00:18:35,882 --> 00:18:37,517
I'm just trying
to give you money.

395
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,486
What did you buy it for?

396
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:42,755
$35,000, but that
was a few years ago.

397
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:45,858
I could probably get $40,000.

398
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,695
It's not really
a financial issue, Mr. Siegel.

399
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,696
Ben.

400
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:50,697
Ben.

401
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:51,864
Ben.

402
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,065
Ben.

403
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:55,202
All right. One, two

404
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,337
three, four.

405
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,705
That's $50,000.

406
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,307
Is that enough?

407
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:01,541
That's more than...

408
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,545
I want this to be a pleasurable
day for both of us.

409
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,248
Another ten-- that's 60,000.

410
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:11,117
It just makes me sick
when I don't bring pleasure

411
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,519
to someone that I admire.

412
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:14,321
Does this bring you pleasure?

413
00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:15,855
My goodness, yes.

414
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,490
Then why aren't you smiling?

415
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,893
The way you spend money,
you never have anything left.

416
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,929
So I'll make more.
It's only dirty paper.

417
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,497
What are you going to do with a house?

418
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,333
You're here for four days.

419
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,767
Maybe I'll stay longer.

420
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:30,036
I got to get to Jack Dragna's.

421
00:19:30,237 --> 00:19:31,137
I'll drive you.

422
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,273
Uh-uh. This is business.

423
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35,308
You don't want to be there.

424
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:46,819
Nice car.

425
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:48,588
Thank you.

426
00:19:59,366 --> 00:20:00,433
Louie.

427
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,669
What the hell is this?

428
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,475
Whoa.

429
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,310
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

430
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,111
I'm looking for Jack Dragna.

431
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,680
Who the fuck are you?

432
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,114
Ben Siegel.

433
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,251
Oh, I'm Louie, Jack's brother.

434
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:20,186
I'll tell Jack you're here.

435
00:20:20,287 --> 00:20:21,454
It will just be a few seconds.

436
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,290
Jack's finishing eating.

437
00:20:25,825 --> 00:20:26,859
Look, Mr. Siegel...

438
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,261
Call me, Ben, Jack.

439
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,563
We run a smooth, little operation.

440
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:33,466
With all due respect
to you, Meyer Lansky,

441
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,535
Charlie Luciano, Joey A,

442
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,670
and whoever the fuck else you represent,

443
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:40,473
I suggest you spend your time
in California

444
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:44,176
looking for broads,
which we got plenty of

445
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,279
and which I understand

446
00:20:46,379 --> 00:20:47,514
is right up your alley.

447
00:20:47,614 --> 00:20:49,916
There's a subject
I can help you out on.

448
00:20:50,016 --> 00:20:51,718
Phone numbers, whatnot,

449
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:54,821
but if you're coming to me,
looking to do business,

450
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:58,090
I'm afraid I'm completely disinterested.

451
00:20:58,325 --> 00:20:59,258
Uninterested.

452
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:01,361
Disinterested means impartial.

453
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:03,696
Uninterested means not interested.

454
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:06,699
You got two alternatives.

455
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,268
You can take your 64 guys
and work for us.

456
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:11,338
That means turning
your smooth, little operation

457
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,707
into a smooth, big operation--
20 betting parlors, not three,

458
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,878
owning a wire service,
not subscribing to one.

459
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:20,380
It means taking risks.

460
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,850
Meyer, Charlie, and I put up
the money. We take 75%.

461
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,219
You keep 25%, which is worth
more than three times

462
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,188
what your 100% is worth now.

463
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,190
What's the second alternative?

464
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,393
The second alternative?

465
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,861
The second alternative.

466
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,095
Hey...

467
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,497
No, come on.

468
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:39,231
You take it.

469
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,400
I got plenty of guns.

470
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,968
Squeeze the trigger, kill me.

471
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:43,202
Kill you?

472
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,971
That's the second alternative?

473
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:57,950
Pazzo.

474
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,687
You have an unusual sense of humor.

475
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:03,356
I think what they say is true.

476
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,392
You're out of your fucking mind.

477
00:22:05,492 --> 00:22:08,595
Take another five seconds.
Make your selection.

478
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:15,301
I guess that means you're
coming to work for us, huh?

479
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,603
It's a ball to have you on board.

480
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:19,205
May I have my gun?
Thank you.

481
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:20,507
Let's get started.

482
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,942
Time is vicious
when you take it for granted.

483
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:24,611
Bugsy, I have a question.

484
00:22:24,711 --> 00:22:27,246
If we break off this thing
with transcontinental...

485
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:28,948
Transcontinental.

486
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,888
All right, I'll give you
the benefit of the doubt

487
00:22:35,988 --> 00:22:38,024
and I will assume
that you didn't know

488
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:39,859
that no one calls me that.

489
00:22:39,959 --> 00:22:42,795
Very nice meeting you, Jack.

490
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,865
Fucking guy's crazy.

491
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:48,034
Want me to run outside
and shoot him in the back?

492
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:50,603
Then we got Meyer Lansky,
Charlie Luciano

493
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:52,271
blowing bullets up our ass.

494
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,372
So what do we do?

495
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:54,641
JACK:
We wait, play along.

496
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,275
Sooner or later,
he'll blow his lid.

497
00:22:56,375 --> 00:23:01,514
Then when we get him,
nobody will give a fuck.

721
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,570
Did you find Mickey Cohen yet?

722
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,373
Uh-huh.

723
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:42,474
All right.

724
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,277
Tell him Biltmore Health Club at 1:00.

725
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:47,646
We meet him there.

726
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,815
You'll pick me up at noon?

727
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:51,550
Good.

728
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:56,121
You still think
we'll bring each other

729
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:59,124
nothing but misery and torment?

730
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:02,828
With a few distractions in between.

731
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:04,996
You call what we've
been doing distractions?

732
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,398
Uh-huh.

733
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,334
Well, thank you.
The feeling's mutual.

734
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:10,736
Good. That's the way
I like it.

735
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:18,176
20 dwarves took turns
doing handstands on the carpet.

736
00:36:18,277 --> 00:36:22,080
20 dwarves took turns doing
handstands on the carpet.

737
00:36:22,281 --> 00:36:24,383
20... What time is it?

738
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,584
1:30.

739
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:26,885
He's half an hour late.

740
00:36:26,985 --> 00:36:29,288
Who does this little schmuck
think he's fucking with?

741
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:33,359
Who are you referring to,
you fruitcake?

742
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:35,494
You better show me some respect.

743
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:36,695
Respect?

744
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:40,666
You got it backward, Mr. Cohen.

745
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:42,868
Unless, of course,
your idea of showing respect

746
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,603
is to rob his place of business.

747
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:46,238
Who said I robbed?

748
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:48,507
Robbed what,
you would-be smoothie?

749
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:50,376
Everything I got is mine.

750
00:36:50,476 --> 00:36:53,379
It's yours
because you stole it from me.

751
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,746
Watch your words.

752
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:56,282
What's mine is mine.

753
00:36:56,382 --> 00:36:58,216
Everything I got I'm keeping.

754
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:02,288
I understand from Jack Dragna
you stole $56,000 and change.

755
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:06,024
The lying, fat fuck.

756
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,560
It was 42, not 56.

757
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,329
I thought
you didn't steal anything.

758
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,732
I didn't, but if I had,
it would have been 42.

759
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:18,036
If I were you, I'd give
that money back by 7:00 tonight.

760
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,405
Fuck you!

761
00:37:19,505 --> 00:37:22,641
If I was you

762
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:26,812
I'd shut my fucking mouth
and watch my step!

763
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,146
Or would you like me to blow

764
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,915
your fucking Adam's apple
down your spine?

765
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,451
Excuse me, but aren't we
in a public place?

766
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,453
Maybe we'd both be better off

767
00:37:34,553 --> 00:37:37,589
if you'd just tone down
your rhetoric one notch.

768
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:39,157
Maybe we'd both be better off

769
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,258
if I left you altogether

770
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,628
and never saw your fucking face again.

771
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:47,633
GEORGE:
What are you laughing at?

772
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:48,767
This guy's deranged.

773
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:49,835
Go get him.

774
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:50,869
What?

775
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,671
Bring him back. Hurry up.

776
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,311
Hey, Mickey! Mickey! Mick...

777
00:37:59,411 --> 00:38:02,180
BEN:
Jack, it's Ben.

778
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,383
I think I got the Mickey Cohen
thing under control.

779
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:06,852
I want you to be at my house
at 7:30 tonight.

780
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:08,820
All right? Good.

781
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:16,227
MICKEY: George, how do you remember
all them fucking lines

782
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:19,064
from them fucking movies?

783
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,932
I know you're a big shot,
but make it quick.

784
00:38:21,032 --> 00:38:22,334
I got a hot date.

785
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,536
I don't have time to be
schmoozed by the likes of you.

786
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,604
I bet you do.

787
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:26,638
I do what?

788
00:38:26,738 --> 00:38:28,173
Have a hot date waiting.

789
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,475
You making fun of me?

790
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:32,043
No, a guy with your balls
must have more women

791
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:35,481
lined up than the Latin quarter.

792
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:39,385
When I go out with a broad,
you can bet she'll be a star--

793
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,820
like Betty Grable or Ava Gardner.

794
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,921
I don't go for tarty broads

795
00:38:43,021 --> 00:38:45,491
like you and your pals
from back east.

796
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:47,225
What tarty broads?

797
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,360
Shirley what's-her-name

798
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:51,763
that Charlie Luciano drags around.

799
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:55,401
That broad Joey A
goes out with, Victoria Hill--

800
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,370
That blonde bimbo,
that Moe-Gus-and-Curly fuck.

801
00:38:58,470 --> 00:38:59,705
That's Virginia Hill.

802
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:00,739
Whatever.

803
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:01,973
Why call her a tart?

804
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,442
That's what she is.

805
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:07,813
Joe Epstein from Chicago,
the drummer Gene Krupa,

806
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,681
the bullfighter from Mexico,

807
00:39:09,781 --> 00:39:11,517
the frenchman...

808
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,419
This conversation is beneath me.

809
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,022
All right, Mickey, look, I'm expanding

810
00:39:17,122 --> 00:39:19,525
and I'm thinking, if I'm going to expand

811
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,960
why do it with the guys who got taken?

812
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,162
Why don't I expand
with the guy who took them?

813
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,497
What's in it for me?

814
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:26,532
Money.

815
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:27,533
How much?

816
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,735
$5,000 a week.

817
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:33,304
Does that include a blow job?

818
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:34,773
GEORGE:
Watch your mouth.

819
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,207
You're lucky he don't plug you.

820
00:39:36,442 --> 00:39:37,476
He can't.

821
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:38,477
He needs me.

822
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:40,412
Ain't you been listening

823
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,280
or have you been
too busy learning lines

824
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,982
for your fairy acting jobs?

825
00:39:44,082 --> 00:39:46,017
-Six.
-Ten.

826
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,919
But I want the 42,000 you stole

827
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:49,555
back by 7:00 tonight.

828
00:39:49,655 --> 00:39:53,492
I put up my life and my liberty
on that fucking score.

829
00:39:53,592 --> 00:39:56,027
I'll kick back 20.

830
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,729
The whole 42 I wouldn't kick back

831
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:58,897
if it was my mother.

832
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,566
A penny less, we got no deal.

833
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:15,080
How would he know she fucked
Gene Krupa and a bullfighter?

834
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,082
Well, it ain't exactly
confidential info,

835
00:40:17,182 --> 00:40:18,517
baby blue eyes.

836
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:20,318
Krupa, I know about

837
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,788
and a couple of the bullfighters.

838
00:40:25,791 --> 00:40:27,459
couple of bullfighters.

839
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:29,795
GEORGE:
That's what I heard.

840
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:33,131
Ben, she is who she is.
You ain't going to change her.

841
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,633
What man ever changed a woman?

842
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:37,102
I don't go by
what other man have done.

843
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,470
I believe in freash starts.

844
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,605
Freash starts?

845
00:40:39,705 --> 00:40:41,473
Hey, without freash starts

846
00:40:41,573 --> 00:40:42,874
you and me would have been history

847
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,577
before we were 19.

848
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:51,950
I hope you like scampi served
on a bed of soft brown rice,

849
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:55,353
rimmed by carrots and peas.

850
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,255
What's the matter?

851
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:59,691
Nothing.

852
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,127
Come on, eat.

853
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:04,863
It will make you big and strong.

854
00:41:06,898 --> 00:41:10,468
What do you think of bullfighting?

855
00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:13,805
It's been a while since I tried it.

856
00:41:13,905 --> 00:41:16,141
Well, what are your memories?

857
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,910
Dangerous and fun.

858
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,647
What about drums?

859
00:41:21,747 --> 00:41:24,750
What about drums?

860
00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:26,718
I'm a singer.

861
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,520
Ever sing with a drummer?

862
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,957
I've sung
with all kinds of musicians.

863
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:34,826
Are you going to eat or not?
Your dinner's getting cold.

864
00:41:34,926 --> 00:41:36,628
It's already cold.

865
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:50,676
Were you under the impression
that I was a virgin?

866
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:52,110
No, no, no, I just thought maybe

867
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,945
there was somebody you hadn't fucked.

868
00:42:19,771 --> 00:42:21,973
That's not pleasant.

869
00:42:22,073 --> 00:42:23,642
You listen to me, mister.

870
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:25,844
You fucked around,
and I fucked around.

871
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,846
You want to tell me your stories, fine.

872
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:29,047
Then I'll tell you mine.

873
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:31,549
You want to bury the past,
we can do that, too

874
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,452
but don't play these games with me.

875
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,655
What we share
should be good enough.

876
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,958
If it isn't,
we should call it quits.

877
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,559
What will it be?

878
00:42:42,828 --> 00:42:44,062
How about iodine?

879
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:46,932
You need some soap and water.

880
00:42:47,032 --> 00:42:48,734
Why don't you wash out
your fucking mouth

881
00:42:48,834 --> 00:42:50,168
while you're at it.

882
00:42:50,268 --> 00:42:51,970
I'm going home.

883
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:53,238
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

884
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,473
Where you going?
Come here.

885
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:56,875
Come here.

886
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:58,944
Goddamn it, let go of me!

887
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:00,045
I'm not staying!

888
00:43:00,145 --> 00:43:01,913
Let go of me..!

889
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:03,248
You're not..!

890
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,956
Get your hands off me, goddamn it!

891
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:13,324
Goddamn it, let go of me!

892
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,093
I'm leaving.
I'm never coming back.

893
00:43:15,193 --> 00:43:17,428
I'm telling you...

894
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:18,764
Hey, Benny!

895
00:43:18,864 --> 00:43:20,031
Ah!

896
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,474
Hi, Ben. You okay?

897
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:30,776
I'm fine.

898
00:43:30,876 --> 00:43:33,211
42,000 on the nose.

899
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,814
Thank you very much.

900
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,515
This is Virginia Hill.

901
00:43:37,749 --> 00:43:38,784
Mickey Cohen.

902
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,019
Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

903
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,021
I've heard a lot about you.

904
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,990
You want me to come in?

905
00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:47,859
Would you be offended
if I took a rain check?

906
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,595
Not under the circumstances.

907
00:43:50,696 --> 00:43:52,030
What happened to your head?

908
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,000
A vicious insect.
I'll see you tomorrow.

909
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:13,852
Hey, goombah!

910
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,322
Kiss my tukis.

911
00:44:23,394 --> 00:44:25,997
Fucking jew prick.

912
00:44:33,872 --> 00:44:35,473
Did you ever meet Jack Dragna?

913
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:36,875
No.

914
00:44:36,975 --> 00:44:40,045
Good. I got to speak to Jack alone.

915
00:44:40,145 --> 00:44:41,179
Will you wait?

916
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,081
What for?

917
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:44,682
Will you just wait
for me, please?

918
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:51,322
In there.

919
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:02,200
JACK:
Cocksucking thief dished it back.

920
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,169
Uh-huh. Every cent.

921
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,204
-No kidding?
-Yep.

922
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,173
I'll be a son of a bitch.

923
00:45:08,273 --> 00:45:10,842
How did you get him to go along?

924
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:14,212
We reached an accommodation.
I gave him a job.

925
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,814
What job?

926
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:19,084
Running the day-to-day
mechanics of my operation.

927
00:45:19,184 --> 00:45:20,718
That's my job.

928
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:23,755
No, that was your job.
You're working for him now.

929
00:45:23,855 --> 00:45:25,290
I think I'm missing
something here.

930
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:29,494
You certainly are--
about $14,000 and change.

931
00:45:29,594 --> 00:45:32,998
That's the $14,000
that you stole from us

932
00:45:33,098 --> 00:45:34,532
after the 42 that Mickey took.

933
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:35,666
Wait a minute...

934
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:37,302
Do you want to fuck me?

935
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:38,736
What?

936
00:45:38,837 --> 00:45:40,772
That's a simple question.
Do you want to fuck me?

937
00:45:40,872 --> 00:45:43,174
Of course not.

938
00:45:43,274 --> 00:45:44,209
You sure?

939
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:45,476
Of course.

940
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,379
Let me ask you this--
you want to rape me?

941
00:45:48,479 --> 00:45:49,414
This is crazy.

942
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,849
Answer the question.

943
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:53,084
Do not lie to me.

944
00:45:53,184 --> 00:45:54,352
You stole from me

945
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,655
and stealing is a form of rape.

946
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,925
Did you think
you could get away with it?!

947
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:01,993
Did you think
you could steal from me?!

948
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:05,096
From Meyer Lansky,
Charlie Luciano, and me

949
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,397
and get away with it?!

950
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,867
That you could rape us
and humiliate us?!

951
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:13,004
Did you think
you could get away with it?!

952
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:14,072
No.

953
00:46:14,172 --> 00:46:16,007
Do not lie to me!

954
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,242
I'm not lying.

955
00:46:17,342 --> 00:46:18,343
You're not lying.

956
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,045
That means you raped us

957
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,814
even though you thought
we would catch you.

958
00:46:22,914 --> 00:46:24,049
It wasn't like that...

959
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:25,483
What was it like?!

960
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,485
You want to change your answer?

961
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:29,087
It's a simple question.

962
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:31,189
Did you think you could
get away with it, or not?

963
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,892
Did you, or not?!

964
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:35,126
I won't! I won't!

965
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:36,127
You won't what?!

966
00:46:36,227 --> 00:46:37,462
I won't do it again!

967
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:38,596
Oh, again!

968
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:40,231
You won't do it again?!

969
00:46:40,331 --> 00:46:41,466
How do you know

970
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,701
I won't kill you right here?!

971
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:45,370
I'm begging you, Ben.

972
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,306
What do you want?
You want to kill me?

973
00:46:48,406 --> 00:46:50,842
You want another chance?

974
00:46:50,942 --> 00:46:52,210
Let me tell you something--

975
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,912
You can't.

976
00:46:54,012 --> 00:46:55,046
No one can.

977
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:57,983
I can't kill me.

978
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,684
See?

979
00:46:59,918 --> 00:47:00,986
Now try it!

980
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:02,988
Give it to me! Come on!

981
00:47:03,088 --> 00:47:03,989
I can't!

982
00:47:04,089 --> 00:47:05,323
Why? What is it?

983
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:06,992
Are you afraid to die?

984
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:08,259
Crawl.

985
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:09,961
Crawl, come on.

986
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:10,962
I can't.

987
00:47:11,062 --> 00:47:13,098
Now, bark-- like the dog

988
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:15,700
that you wish that you was
decent enough to be.

989
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,902
Bark!

990
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:17,903
Bark!

991
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:18,904
Bowwow?

992
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:20,005
Crawl and bark.

993
00:47:20,105 --> 00:47:21,372
Bowwow! Bowwow!

994
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:23,408
More! Let me hear that bark!

995
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:24,642
More! More!

996
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,611
Come on, give me more!

997
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,013
Louder!

998
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:29,514
Bowwow! Bowwow!

999
00:47:29,614 --> 00:47:31,482
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1000
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:35,921
Yes! Yes! That's good!
More! More!

1001
00:47:36,021 --> 00:47:37,455
Now let me hear you oink

1002
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:40,258
like the treacherous,
devious pig that you are!

1003
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:41,459
Come on! Come on!

1004
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,627
Get around there!

1005
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,029
Come on! Oink!

1006
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:45,730
Now! Oink!

1007
00:47:45,931 --> 00:47:47,098
Oink! Oink! Oink!

1008
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,399
Come on!

1009
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:50,135
Oink, oink, oink, oink...

1010
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,102
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1011
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,170
Oink, oink...

1012
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,171
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1013
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,705
Oink, oink, oink, oink...

1014
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:57,542
Get up! Get up!

1015
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:02,780
Now look me in the eye.

1016
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,483
Go home, get the money you stole

1017
00:48:05,583 --> 00:48:07,085
and you bring it to me.

1018
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,323
This goes back in the safe
at the betting parlor.

1019
00:48:12,423 --> 00:48:14,559
Thanks, Ben.

1020
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:17,095
You can count on me for anything.

1021
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,329
We'll see.

1022
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:19,564
Everybody needs a fresh start

1023
00:48:19,664 --> 00:48:20,598
once in a while.

1024
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,936
Get out.

1025
00:48:59,304 --> 00:49:00,938
We going to eat?

1026
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,748
What?

1027
00:50:50,848 --> 00:50:54,285
VIRGINIA:
Who was the Countess di Frasso?

1028
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:58,656
BEN: Who was the Countess di Frasso?
You're asking me?

1029
00:50:58,756 --> 00:51:00,191
Yeah, I'm asking you.

1030
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:02,360
She's the wife
of that Italian Count.

1031
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:04,262
I danced with her at Ciro's.

1032
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:06,797
Yeah, I know you danced with her.

1033
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,601
All right, look, it just so happens

1034
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:12,703
that the Countess's husband, the Count,

1035
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:14,405
is a very good friend of Mussolini.

1036
00:51:14,505 --> 00:51:16,006
So?

1037
00:51:16,107 --> 00:51:19,577
The Countess's husband
is Mussolini's good friend.

1038
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:22,247
I got it the first time.
So what?

1039
00:51:22,347 --> 00:51:25,950
The world is being destroyed
by Hitler and Mussolini.

1040
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,885
I can stop him.

1041
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:28,986
What do you mean?

1042
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,055
What do you think I mean?

1043
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,057
Kill him? Kill Mussolini?

1044
00:51:33,158 --> 00:51:36,060
I am using the Count
to get to Mussolini.

1045
00:51:36,161 --> 00:51:38,663
You are going to kill
Mussolini personally

1046
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,265
in the middle of a war?

1047
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:44,135
That is the most pathetic excuse
I've ever heard.

1048
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:45,903
If you want to fuck
some low-life Countess

1049
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,238
have the guts to say it.

1050
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,107
Then do it, and fuck yourself
while you're at it.

1051
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,809
I am hatching a secret plan.

1052
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:54,145
You're full of secrets.

1053
00:51:54,245 --> 00:51:55,813
What do you mean?

1054
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:57,248
Things not out in the open.

1055
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,449
What's not out in the open?

1056
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,918
Me. You're afraid to be seen with me.

1057
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,453
I'm a secret.

1058
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:03,554
From who?

1059
00:52:03,654 --> 00:52:04,889
You know who.

1060
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:07,792
You told me you don't
keep secrets from Esta.

1061
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,160
That's different.

1062
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:11,662
Because I'm a secret from her.

1063
00:52:11,762 --> 00:52:13,664
I don't want to be anybody's secret.

1064
00:52:13,764 --> 00:52:16,100
You're nobody's secret.
Will you give me a chance?

1065
00:52:16,201 --> 00:52:19,036
You had your chance.
We never go anywhere.

1066
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,071
From now on,
we'll go everywhere together.

1067
00:52:21,172 --> 00:52:22,673
-Everywhere?
-Everywhere.

1068
00:52:22,773 --> 00:52:24,209
Give me a chance.

1069
00:52:24,309 --> 00:52:27,812
Everybody deserves
a fresh start once in a while.

1070
00:52:38,789 --> 00:52:39,790
Come on, sugar, let's go.

1071
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,958
I can't, Ben.

1072
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:42,393
Can't what?

1073
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:43,994
Now you don't understand.

1074
00:52:44,229 --> 00:52:45,230
I'm sorry.

1075
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:46,531
I can't, Ben.

1076
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:47,532
BEN:
Come on, come on.

1077
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,767
I'm really much too nervous.

1078
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:51,202
Come on, let's go.

1079
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,204

Do you know this guy here, Harry Greenberg?

You don't know him?

1262
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:27,017
I thought...

1263
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,086
I know him, all right?

1264
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:31,221
Mickey, I'm getting a divorce.

That's why I'm making this trip.

1266
01:01:32,790 --> 01:01:35,793
I'm definitely getting a divorce.

1267
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,527
Definitely?

1268
01:01:37,762 --> 01:01:39,396
Definitely.

1269

Mmm.

1270
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,834
What?

1271
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,072
I'm sorry to hear that, Benny.

breaking up like that

1274

1284
01:02:22,339 --> 01:02:23,908
In with the potatoes.

There's a matter we have to discuss.

I want to discuss with you.

this night to ourselves.

Sorry. I planned
to see them tomorrow, but...

1300

Does Meyer know that
it's Millicent's birthday?

1301
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,095
I told him.

1302
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:21,465
I think they got a problem
with this business thing I did.

of a shack in Las Vegas.

1307

You had no right to give it up.

1308
01:03:37,314 --> 01:03:39,316
It was an outhouse.

1309
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,552
You had no right to close it
without consulting us.

1310

I got no arrangement with you, Vito.

I do have an arrangement
with Meyer and Charlie,

I'm talking about Las Vegas, Nevada.

Everything will be air-cooled--

1336

every room, 72 degrees at all times.

1337
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,619

to Las Vegas in an hour.

We'll have planes back and forth.

01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,884
I just got to finish this meeting...

1431
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,253
Oh, you always...

1432
01:08:09,353 --> 01:08:10,420
I don't want to hear you!

1433
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,021
Millicent...

1434
01:08:12,222 --> 01:08:13,890
Honey, honey, honey.

1435
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,259
Millicent...

1436
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:16,993
We're just going to be...

1437
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:18,528
Come on, honey.

1438
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:20,997
Millicent, open the door, honey.

1439
01:08:21,097 --> 01:08:23,267
I just want to say one thing.

1440
01:08:23,367 --> 01:08:25,702
Barbara, are you in there too?

1441
01:08:28,205 --> 01:08:30,240
Just come on down,
and I'll light the candles.

1442
01:08:30,340 --> 01:08:31,808
I'm going to light the candles.

1443
01:08:31,908 --> 01:08:34,678
I'm lighting the candles.

1444
01:08:34,778 --> 01:08:36,546
Come on down.

1445
01:08:36,646 --> 01:08:37,681
I'm lighting the candles.

1446
01:08:37,781 --> 01:08:39,149
Ben.

1447
01:08:39,249 --> 01:08:41,251
Sorry. The party got
a little out of control,

1448
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:43,187
but I fixed it.

1449
01:08:43,287 --> 01:08:47,056
With Charlie in jail,
I'll have to confer with him

1450
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,326
to make any important
money decisions final.

1451
01:08:49,426 --> 01:08:51,528
Pending that talk and his approval,

1452
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:54,664
I'm happy to say
you've got yourself a deal.

1453
01:08:54,764 --> 01:08:56,333
Good. Great.

1454
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:59,135
When would you be ready
to get started?

1455
01:08:59,236 --> 01:09:01,438
I'm going to Italy in a week

1456
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,307
so that plus however long it takes.

1457
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:05,609
However long what takes?

1458
01:09:05,709 --> 01:09:08,612
The assassination of Mussolini.

1459
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,880
Who's going
to assassinate Mussolini?

1460
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:16,320
Come here.

1461
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,689
Benny, don't fuck this up
by trying to be funny.

1462
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:22,592
Mussolini and Hitler
have to be stopped.

1463
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:24,594
They're trying to knock off
every jew on earth.

1464
01:09:24,694 --> 01:09:26,496
If I don't do something, who will--

1465
01:09:26,596 --> 01:09:28,465
A bunch of Italians?
I can stop Mussolini.

1466
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:31,935
Did you ever hear of the Allied Forces?

1467
01:09:32,035 --> 01:09:35,239
The Allied Forces don't have the access.

1468
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:36,340
I have the access.

1469
01:09:36,440 --> 01:09:38,074
You have the access?

1470
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,944
One of Mussolini's best friends
is the Count di Frasso.

1471
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:44,448
The Count's wife, Dorothy,
has the hots for me.

1472
01:09:44,548 --> 01:09:47,083
She will get me right up close.

1473
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,652
I can blow him halfway to Siberia.

1474
01:09:48,752 --> 01:09:52,188
Ben, listen to me very carefully.

1475
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:55,492
Don't repeat what you just said
to me to anybody else.

1476
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:57,227
That's right, it's secret.

1477
01:09:57,327 --> 01:09:59,496
I'm saying it to you
for a different reason.

1478
01:09:59,596 --> 01:10:00,897
Why?

1479
01:10:00,997 --> 01:10:05,168
Because at best,
any normal person you say it to

1480
01:10:05,269 --> 01:10:07,504
will never take anything
you say seriously again,

1481
01:10:07,604 --> 01:10:09,506
so nothing more to the guys.

1482
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:14,378
Sure, sure, but Mussolini
is a dead man.

1483
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:16,480
I'm going to light the candles!

1484
01:10:16,580 --> 01:10:18,848
I'm lighting the candles!

1485
01:10:18,948 --> 01:10:20,484
I'm lighting the candles!

1486
01:10:20,584 --> 01:10:23,119
Let's see what Meyer wants to have.

1487
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,255
We want to go eat.

1488
01:10:25,355 --> 01:10:27,591
We didn't come here to eat.
We came here to do business.

1489
01:10:27,691 --> 01:10:30,827
We're starving here.

1490
01:10:30,927 --> 01:10:32,896
All right.

1491
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:36,533
I lit the candles.

1492
01:10:36,633 --> 01:10:37,901
Millicent!

1493
01:10:38,001 --> 01:10:40,169
I lit the candles!

1494
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:41,871
I lit the candles!

1495
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:45,309
So, uh, we finished all our business?

1496
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:46,610
As far as I can see.

1497
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:50,280
We shouldn't have barged in
on you like this, Benny.

1498
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:53,417
We'll talk tomorrow.
It sounds good.

1499
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:54,651
Take care, Ben.

1500
01:10:54,751 --> 01:10:57,787
Thanks for coming.
Thanks. Thanks for coming by.

1501
01:10:57,887 --> 01:10:58,822
Good luck.

1502
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:01,391
Thanks. Joey...

1503
01:11:01,491 --> 01:11:03,593
Listen, uh...

1504
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:05,562
I'm sorry about Virginia.

1505
01:11:05,662 --> 01:11:07,964
You want to take a punch at me,

1506
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:10,500
take a punch at me.

1507
01:11:13,537 --> 01:11:18,742
Well, we're even now.
I'm sorry, Joey.

1508
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:20,176
I know you were in love with her.

1509
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,512
Are you kidding me?

1510
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:25,482
I'd never let myself fall
in love with a slut like her.

1511
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:05,755
Your mouth is bleeding.

1512
01:12:05,855 --> 01:12:09,393
Yeah, I, uh... I tripped.
I whacked it on a table.

1513
01:12:09,493 --> 01:12:12,629
It's nothing.

1514
01:12:12,729 --> 01:12:15,732
I don't think we can go
on like this, Ben.

1515
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:18,334
Like what?

1516
01:12:18,435 --> 01:12:21,505
Do you think
we ought to get a divorce?

1517
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:24,374
What are you talking about?

1518
01:12:24,474 --> 01:12:26,810
Some friends just dropped by
at the wrong time, that's all.

1519
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,745
Everything's fine now.

1520
01:12:31,715 --> 01:12:32,816
Sit down.

1521
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:40,089
I'm going to go say
good night to the girls.

1522
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:17,561
Miss me?

1523
01:13:17,661 --> 01:13:19,128
Depends.

1524
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:22,832
You're looking very smug.

1525
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:24,434
So did you ask her for a divorce?

1526
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:27,571
Now come on.
We got to drink a toast.

1527
01:13:27,671 --> 01:13:31,074
I got this whole thing
worked out in my mind now.

1528
01:13:31,174 --> 01:13:33,176
I sold them on the idea.

1529
01:13:33,276 --> 01:13:36,646
We're going to drink
a toast to our destiny.

1530
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:38,882
So did you ask her for a divorce?

1531
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,416
Uh, not in so many words,

1532
01:13:40,517 --> 01:13:42,752
but I got it all mapped out...

1533
01:13:42,852 --> 01:13:45,188
Do me a favor, would you?
Only favor I'll ever ask you.

1534
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:46,756
Anything.

1535
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:48,525
Finish your drink, get the fuck out

1536
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:50,594
and never come near me again.

1537
01:13:50,694 --> 01:13:53,730
You don't understand.
I'm laying the groundwork...

1538
01:13:57,534 --> 01:13:59,703
Having a good time, huh?

1539
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:00,770
Ben!

1540
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:02,271
You like that robe?

1541
01:14:02,539 --> 01:14:03,473
Ben!

1542
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,044
You maniac!
You fucking lunatic!

1543
01:14:08,144 --> 01:14:12,882
Look what you've done.
Are you hurt, baby?

1544
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,484
BEN:
I don't know if you're hurt,

1545
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,019
but you're lucky you're alive.

1546
01:14:16,119 --> 01:14:20,056
You got three minutes to get
your panties on and get out!

1547
01:14:20,156 --> 01:14:22,726
He's my brother,
you psychotic asshole!

1548
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:24,293
You expect me to fall for that?

1549
01:14:24,494 --> 01:14:25,529
I don't care.

1550
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:27,531
I only care that you
get psychiatric help

1551
01:14:27,631 --> 01:14:30,366
and never come around
bothering us anymore.

1552
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,435
Us? us?

1553
01:14:32,536 --> 01:14:34,337
Leave him alone!
He's my brother!

1554
01:14:34,538 --> 01:14:35,872
Stop it, Ben!

1555
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:39,576
Could you show me some form
of identification, please?

1556
01:14:39,676 --> 01:14:41,177
Do you have any?

1557
01:14:41,277 --> 01:14:45,048
It's in my pants in the guest bathroom.

1558
01:14:45,148 --> 01:14:46,115
JESUS.

1559
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:47,551
I'm sorry.

1560
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,853
He does
very unexpected things.

1561
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:51,888
Are you hurt?
Are you cut anywhere?

1562
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,823
Any glass wedged anywhere?

1563
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:57,961
Oh, god.

1564
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,130
You're right.
You're Chick.

1565
01:15:01,230 --> 01:15:02,398
You're her brother.

1566
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:06,302
Why didn't you tell me it was Chick?

1567
01:15:06,536 --> 01:15:07,671
Chick,

1568
01:15:07,771 --> 01:15:10,306
I'm going to buy you
a Cadillac, Chick.

1569
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,708
A Cadillac?

1570
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:15,845
How about a red one,
maybe a convertible?

1571
01:15:15,945 --> 01:15:17,080
A red, convertible Cadillac.

1572
01:15:17,180 --> 01:15:18,982
Don't sell out so cheap.

1573
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:22,085
I've wanted a Cadillac
since I was six.

1574
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:25,021
BEN: You know what we'll do
in Chick's Cadillac?

1575
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:26,155
We're going to take a trip.

1576
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:27,857
You're going to take a trip.

1577
01:15:27,957 --> 01:15:30,159
To our destiny-- Las Vegas.

1578
01:15:30,259 --> 01:15:33,229
You couldn't drag me
to that sand hole rattrap

1579
01:15:33,329 --> 01:15:34,898
with a fishnet.

1580
01:15:34,998 --> 01:15:39,102
We are going to build
a Garden of Eden in the desert.

1581
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:40,704
You know what it is?

1582
01:15:40,804 --> 01:15:44,040
It's an oasis--
an oasis with a casino.

1583
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,242
It's legal. It's Nevada.

1584
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:48,144
We're going to have
palm trees and pools.

1585
01:15:48,244 --> 01:15:50,914
We'll have rose gardens
more beautiful than Versailles.

1586
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:52,716
We're going
to design them all ourselves.

1587
01:15:52,816 --> 01:15:54,117
Get away from me!

1588
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,686
We're going to have the greatest
entertainers in the world.

1589
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:59,255
We'll have Jolson, Cantor, and Durante.

1590
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:01,858
We'll have Gary Cooper, Victor Mature.

1591
01:16:01,958 --> 01:16:06,529
We'll have Dana Andrews, honey,
and they'll just hang around

1592
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,998
because it will be the most
beautiful, spectacular place

1593
01:16:09,098 --> 01:16:10,299
they've ever been invited to.

1594
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:14,738
And you are going to own
5 3/4% of the whole thing.

1595
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:16,740
Now that's gross, not net.

1596
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:19,075
We're going to be
the greatest hosts in the west.

1597
01:16:19,175 --> 01:16:22,612
And we're going to name it after you.

1598
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:25,882
We're going to call it The Flamingo.

1599
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,985
You know, I've brought

1600
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:30,519
nothing but trouble to every man

1601
01:16:30,620 --> 01:16:32,889
Who ever went on the line for me.

1602
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:37,694
Good. That's what they get
for trying to steal my girl.

1603
01:16:41,097 --> 01:16:45,568
♪ ..I'm with you always

1604
01:16:45,669 --> 01:16:49,973
♪ I'm with you rain or shine...

1605
01:16:50,073 --> 01:16:52,041
MAN:
My philosophy's always been:

1606
01:16:52,141 --> 01:16:55,679
Make it different and new,
or don't make it at all.

1607
01:16:55,779 --> 01:16:57,881
That's why I've gone for a separation

1608
01:16:57,981 --> 01:17:01,384
between the two structures
and for a curved effect

1609
01:17:01,484 --> 01:17:04,253
within traditional
linear principles.

1610
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:06,222
Sensational, David.

1611
01:17:06,322 --> 01:17:07,590
Well, thank you.

1612
01:17:07,691 --> 01:17:08,925
Where did you find this guy, Del?

1613
01:17:09,025 --> 01:17:10,860
He's terrific.

1614
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,295
GEORGE:
I must say

1615
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,997
it looks gorgeous to me, Ben.

1616
01:17:14,097 --> 01:17:15,164
Very european.

1617
01:17:15,264 --> 01:17:16,733
Very... French.

1618
01:17:16,833 --> 01:17:20,670
You could sell
these here objects in a museum.

1619
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,039
This stuff is very hard to draw.

1620
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:25,541
The relationship
with the pool bothers me.

1621
01:17:25,742 --> 01:17:27,143
What's wrong with the..?

1622
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:29,979
If you look, you'll see
there isn't enough sun.

1623
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,214
Isn't the point..?

1624
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:33,750
Del, I think your assistant
needs to pay more attention.

1625
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,551
If we slid the pool down here,

1626
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,754
wouldn't we get the sun
on the pool all day?

1627
01:17:37,854 --> 01:17:40,323
This section of the building
wouldn't shield it.

1628
01:17:40,423 --> 01:17:42,025
Am I right or not?

1629
01:17:42,125 --> 01:17:43,159
David.

1630
01:17:43,259 --> 01:17:45,695
Uh, yeah, sure,
but that would change

1631
01:17:45,795 --> 01:17:48,364
the perspective of the pool
in relation to the casino.

1632
01:17:48,464 --> 01:17:50,834
The only thing I'm interested in

1633
01:17:50,934 --> 01:17:54,337
is if we move the pool,
will the sun hit it all day?

1634
01:17:54,437 --> 01:17:56,239
Yes, it will.

1635
01:17:56,339 --> 01:17:57,406
Move the pool.

1636
01:17:57,673 --> 01:17:58,942
Ben,

1637
01:17:59,042 --> 01:18:01,144
I hate to bear bad tidings,
but we've inflated

1638
01:18:01,244 --> 01:18:02,478
the budget to two million.

1639
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:03,913
No problem.

1640
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,816
Moe:
I got to give Meyer a call.

1641
01:18:08,985 --> 01:18:10,353
Well...

1642
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,029
That's a lot of extra money.

1643
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:22,766
I can't believe he's dead.
I just cannot believe it.

1644
01:18:22,866 --> 01:18:25,101
How long are you going
to keep saying that?

1645
01:18:25,201 --> 01:18:27,203
He was dead the first time
you picked up the paper.

1646
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:28,838
He'll still be dead
an hour from now.

1647
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:32,041
I was moments away
from carrying out my plan.

1648
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:35,644
Ben, the cocksucker's dead.
That's what matters.

1649
01:18:35,745 --> 01:18:37,280
Look at how they got him.

1650
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,749
You couldn't have done
A better job yourself.

1651
01:18:39,849 --> 01:18:41,150
I couldn't have?

1652
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,185
Oy...

1653
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:43,920
Come here.

1654
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:45,755
Tell me what you really think

1655
01:18:45,855 --> 01:18:47,556
of this David, the architect.

1656
01:18:47,757 --> 01:18:48,925
What about him?

1657
01:18:49,025 --> 01:18:50,326
You think he's any good?

1658
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:52,128
There's something
about him I don't like.

1659
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:55,064
What is this fucking red tie?

1660
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:56,099
He's an architect.

1661
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:57,366
What do you want?

1662
01:18:57,466 --> 01:18:59,102
Keep an eye on him.

1663
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:01,104
Something about him makes me nervous.

1664
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:02,872
How did we get him?

1665
01:19:02,972 --> 01:19:06,442
Ben, don't do this.
You'll drive yourself nuts.

1666
01:19:06,542 --> 01:19:08,077
I got to know the truth.

1667
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:10,980
Who ever knows what's going on

1668
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,415
in the mind of any broad?

1669
01:19:12,515 --> 01:19:14,350
George, what are you looking at?

1670
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,718
GEORGE:
Nothing.

1671
01:19:15,819 --> 01:19:17,954
What do you mean? You were
looking at Virginia.

1672
01:19:18,054 --> 01:19:19,388
She was talking.

1673
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:21,390
It's natural to look
at someone who's talking.

1674
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:22,892
You were thinking something.

1675
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:25,661
I was thinking...

1676
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:28,464
Do you want to trust a dame
with your checkbook?

1677
01:19:28,564 --> 01:19:29,899
I've never known a broad

1678
01:19:29,999 --> 01:19:31,801
I'd give more than
a couple hundred bucks to.

1679
01:19:31,901 --> 01:19:35,004
I am not trusting a dame.
I am not trusting a broad.

1680
01:19:35,104 --> 01:19:38,174
I am trusting Virginia
and I trust her completely.

1681
01:19:42,211 --> 01:19:44,680
Del:
Virginia, if you include that wall...

1682
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:48,217
Moe:
Benny, Meyer would like to talk to you.

1683
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:54,257
Meyer, where are you-- in Miami?

1684
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:57,693
A deportation party for Charlie
is a very nice gesture.

1685
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,763
It's horrible.
They lock him up, kick him out.

1686
01:20:00,864 --> 01:20:03,299
What kind of a judicial system do we have?

1687
01:20:03,399 --> 01:20:07,103
Meyer, never trust a prosecutor.

1688
01:20:07,203 --> 01:20:09,072
You do know who this house belongs to,

1689
01:20:09,172 --> 01:20:10,439
don't you? Bugsy Siegel.

1690
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:12,541
No, don't ever call him that.

1691
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,477
Everybody calls him that out here.

1692
01:20:14,577 --> 01:20:17,947
Not to his face. You could bet
your life on that.

1693
01:20:18,047 --> 01:20:20,216
Things haven't changed that much.

1694
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:23,186
BEN:
Of course I feel responsible for Harry.

1695
01:20:23,286 --> 01:20:25,188
I brought him in in the first place.

1696
01:20:25,288 --> 01:20:28,524
But we always knew Harry wasn't
playing with a full deck,

1697
01:20:28,624 --> 01:20:30,493
but for the jobs we had him do,

1698
01:20:30,593 --> 01:20:33,296
We both thought he was okay, right?

1699
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:35,464
I understand, Meyer.
I couldn't agree more.

1700
01:20:35,564 --> 01:20:36,732
When you find him,

1701
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:40,136
You'll have do
what you have to do.

1702
01:20:40,236 --> 01:20:41,938
What overages?

1703
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:45,408
Did they ask Michelangelo

1704
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,476
what it would cost to paint
the Sistine Chapel?

1705
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:50,079
Did they ask Shakespeare what
it would cost to write Macbeth?

1706
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,249
If it costs a little more,
it costs a little more!

1707
01:20:53,349 --> 01:20:56,819
No problem. No problem. No problem.

1708
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,787
I'll see you in New York.

1709
01:20:58,888 --> 01:21:01,057
I'm dealing with a bunch
of bloodless bureaucrats.

1710
01:21:01,157 --> 01:21:03,526
Ben, Harry Greenberg is here.

1711
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:07,130
Where?

1712
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:08,898
Out in the hallway.

1713
01:21:17,573 --> 01:21:19,875
Hi, Harry.

1714
01:21:19,976 --> 01:21:24,380
Ben. What a sight
for sore eyes you are.

1715
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,449
I hope you ain't mad with me
for intruding.

1716
01:21:26,549 --> 01:21:28,817
I had no place else to go.

1717
01:21:29,018 --> 01:21:31,320
No, you did the right thing.

1718
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,455
You tired?

1719
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,623
Yeah, I'm tired.

1720
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:36,960
I got an extra bedroom upstairs.

1721
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,928
Why don't you take a nap?

1722
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:41,364
We'll talk when you wake up.

1723
01:21:41,464 --> 01:21:42,798
Thanks, Ben.

1724
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,500
It's the first one on the left.

1725
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,235
Left.

1726
01:22:10,593 --> 01:22:12,295
Ben.

1727
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:13,862
I thought I was dreaming.

1728
01:22:13,963 --> 01:22:16,399
That's okay.
I always think I'm dreaming.

1729
01:22:16,499 --> 01:22:17,633
That's true.

1730
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:20,036
So what do you think, Ben?

1731
01:22:20,136 --> 01:22:21,337
Am I dreaming

1732
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:25,108
Or am I really out here
in Hollywood with you?

1733
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:26,342
You're here, Harry.

1734
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,843
Thank god.

1735
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,713
If I was anyplace else, I'd be dead.

1736
01:22:30,813 --> 01:22:35,518
I screwed up, Ben.
I'm so stupid.

1737
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,987
I never wanted to hurt nobody

1738
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,256
except the people you told me to hurt

1739
01:22:40,356 --> 01:22:41,790
because they was no fucking good.

1740
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:43,326
You talked.

1741
01:22:43,426 --> 01:22:45,361
I talked.

1742
01:22:55,171 --> 01:22:59,808
Harry... What do you
want me to do for you?

1743
01:23:00,009 --> 01:23:01,177
Well, I thought

1744
01:23:01,277 --> 01:23:02,945
maybe I could work for you out here.

1745
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:06,282
You know, incognito like.

1746
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:09,252
It's tough to be incognito in Hollywood.

1747
01:23:09,352 --> 01:23:10,819
That's true.

1748
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:13,289
It was an idea.

1749
01:23:13,389 --> 01:23:15,924
Bad idea.

1750
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,760
So what should I do?

1751
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,905
Better take a drive with me.

1752
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,774
Yeah, I like driving at night,

1753
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:34,410
especially when someone else
is doing the driving.

1754
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:36,679
I always loved that--

1755
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:38,714
Ever since I was a little kid.

1756
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:43,752
I wish you hadn't done
what you did, Harry.

1757
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,492
Virginia,

1758
01:23:49,592 --> 01:23:51,194
this is Harry Greenberg.

1759
01:23:51,294 --> 01:23:53,229
Harry's a very old friend.

1760
01:23:53,329 --> 01:23:54,897
Virginia Hill.

1761
01:23:55,131 --> 01:23:56,165
Joey A's girl.

1762
01:23:56,265 --> 01:23:59,402
We met a couple
of years ago at the Copa.

1763
01:23:59,502 --> 01:24:01,337
We're going to take a drive.

1764
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:03,206
Oh, I'll come with you.

1765
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:05,608
It would be better if you stay.

1766
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:06,909
I'd rather come along.

1767
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,445
I'd rather you didn't.

1768
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:13,382
I thought you said you wanted
to spend all your time with me.

1769
01:24:13,482 --> 01:24:18,287
Will you please let us
take a fucking drive alone?

1770
01:24:18,387 --> 01:24:20,123
You can take
your whole fucking life alone

1771
01:24:20,223 --> 01:24:21,257
if that's what you want.

1772
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:25,094
You want to come along?
Come along.

1773
01:24:25,194 --> 01:24:29,298
Okay, I got to get my coat and bag.

1774
01:24:34,137 --> 01:24:36,939
So you seen much of Joey recently?

1775
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,375
Not for quite a while.

1776
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:42,478
Me neither, but I haven't
seen any of the guys

01:35:31,927 --> 01:35:34,362
You found somebody, haven't you?

1953
01:35:36,264 --> 01:35:37,900
You want to be with her and not with me.

1954
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,268
I want a divorce.

1955
01:35:40,368 --> 01:35:42,337
Is that what you want, is it?

1956
01:35:42,437 --> 01:35:46,208
I want to take care of you.

1957
01:35:46,308 --> 01:35:47,910
I want to take care of the children.

1958
01:35:48,010 --> 01:35:49,311
I want...

1959
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:51,847
A divorce. You want
a divorce, don't you?

1960
01:35:59,321 --> 01:36:02,190
Say it!

1961
01:36:02,290 --> 01:36:03,992
Answer me!

1962
01:36:07,796 --> 01:36:09,798
You want a divorce, don't you?

1963
01:36:12,567 --> 01:36:14,136
You want a divorce.

1964
01:36:14,236 --> 01:36:15,603
Say it!

1965
01:36:15,871 --> 01:36:18,440
I do.

1966
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:31,920
Don't come out of this room for a minute.

1967
01:37:58,273 --> 01:38:00,275
( NO AUDIO )

1968
01:38:06,081 --> 01:38:08,116
BEN:
Is this not the most spectacular sight

1969
01:38:08,216 --> 01:38:10,285
you've ever seen?

1970
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:11,786
It's breathtaking.

1971
01:38:11,987 --> 01:38:13,788
It's vast. It's intimate.

1972
01:38:14,022 --> 01:38:15,023
It's original.

1973
01:38:15,123 --> 01:38:18,860
It's... Where's the pool?

1974
01:38:18,961 --> 01:38:21,396
Uh, right through here.

1975
01:38:21,496 --> 01:38:23,165
How can I see the pool from the casino?

1976
01:38:23,265 --> 01:38:24,933
The pool from the casino?

1977
01:38:25,033 --> 01:38:26,368
Your point was to get the sun

1978
01:38:26,468 --> 01:38:29,104
down on the pool unobstructed.

1979
01:38:29,204 --> 01:38:32,440
I thought we were going
to be able to see the pool.

1980
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:35,277
We said you could see the pool...

1981
01:38:35,377 --> 01:38:36,611
The problem is

1982
01:38:36,711 --> 01:38:38,446
this is a bearing wall.

1983
01:38:38,546 --> 01:38:40,949
BEN:
Okay, get rid of it.

1984
01:38:41,049 --> 01:38:44,386
David:
But it's supporting the entire structure.

1985
01:38:44,486 --> 01:38:46,188
Ben, you understand what David is saying?

1986
01:38:46,288 --> 01:38:47,822
I got the point, Virginia.

1987
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:51,193
I don't need you to parrot
everything this guy says.

1988
01:38:51,293 --> 01:38:53,095
Look, just get rid of the wall.

1989
01:38:53,195 --> 01:38:56,364
We can make the wall glass

1990
01:38:56,464 --> 01:38:58,066
so you can see the pool from the casino,

1991
01:38:58,166 --> 01:39:00,235
but it's going to be expensive.

1992
01:39:00,335 --> 01:39:02,304
I got to put a header beam up there.

1993
01:39:02,404 --> 01:39:03,305
A header beam.

1994
01:39:03,405 --> 01:39:04,939
You saved the day.

1995
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:07,209
Del:
With all the overages I'm picking up,

1996
01:39:07,309 --> 01:39:09,477
we're looking at a budget up near...

1997
01:39:09,577 --> 01:39:10,812
Virginia, what is it?

1998
01:39:11,013 --> 01:39:12,180
$4 1/2 million.

1999
01:39:12,280 --> 01:39:13,615
No problem.

2000
01:39:20,422 --> 01:39:22,590
Do you understand the position
you're putting us in?

2001
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:25,360
If you're going to do
something, do it right.

2002
01:39:30,965 --> 01:39:32,967
Who the hell are they?

2003
01:39:40,675 --> 01:39:42,077
Bugsy Siegel, Federal Marshals.

2004
01:39:42,177 --> 01:39:43,445
I have a warrant for your arrest.

2005
01:39:43,545 --> 01:39:44,912
I don't know anybody of that name

2006
01:39:45,013 --> 01:39:46,181
either here or anywhere else.

2007
01:39:46,281 --> 01:39:48,883
Benjamin Siegel, I have
a warrant for your arrest

2008
01:39:48,983 --> 01:39:50,285
and a court order directing me

2009
01:39:50,385 --> 01:39:53,888
to deliver you to the proper authorities

2010
01:39:53,988 --> 01:39:56,224
in the county of Los Angeles.

2011
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,759
What's the charge?

2012
01:39:57,992 --> 01:39:58,960
Homicide.

2013
01:39:59,061 --> 01:40:00,995
MAN:
Hey, Bugsy, is it true

2014
01:40:01,096 --> 01:40:03,565
that Harry Greenberg
was your best friend?

2015
01:40:03,665 --> 01:40:05,167
Are you guilty?

2016
01:40:05,267 --> 01:40:07,502
Why did you kill your best friend?

2017
01:40:07,602 --> 01:40:09,904
Bugsy, give us a statement.

2018
01:40:10,004 --> 01:40:12,340
Is it true Harry Greenberg
was going to testify

2019
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,610
against all your friends?

2020
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:18,313
Mr. Siegel, come on,
give us a statement.

2021
01:40:18,413 --> 01:40:21,049
I only have two things to say.

2022
01:40:21,149 --> 01:40:24,052
First, the name is Ben, as in Benjamin,

2023
01:40:24,152 --> 01:40:26,854
and second, I'll see all of you
at the opening of The Flamingo

2024
01:40:27,055 --> 01:40:28,690
on Christmas Day.

2025
01:40:30,725 --> 01:40:32,127
MAN:
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2026
01:40:32,227 --> 01:40:34,362
I'm Assistant
District Attorney Hartman.

2027
01:40:34,462 --> 01:40:35,797
I'm in charge of this case.

2028
01:40:35,897 --> 01:40:37,565
You can leave the prisoner with me.

2029
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:40,068
Right this way, sir.

2030
01:40:41,803 --> 01:40:43,538
Don't let anybody else inside.

2031
01:40:43,638 --> 01:40:46,074
Yes, sir.

2032
01:40:46,174 --> 01:40:50,345
$30,000 to your campaign's not
enough to keep me on the street?

2033
01:40:50,445 --> 01:40:53,648
Shh. The walls are thin.
I had to have you arrested.

2034
01:40:53,748 --> 01:40:54,982
You got not witness.

2035
01:40:55,083 --> 01:40:56,584
You can't have a case without a witness.

2036
01:40:56,684 --> 01:40:57,719
The taxi driver.

2037
01:40:57,819 --> 01:40:59,121
What taxi driver?

2038
01:40:59,221 --> 01:41:02,224
He dropped Harry Greenberg
off at your house.

2039
01:41:02,324 --> 01:41:04,226
You got a name?

2040
01:41:04,326 --> 01:41:05,960
Yeah.

2041
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:09,364
I want that name to fall
into the hands of Mickey Cohen.

2042
01:41:09,464 --> 01:41:12,700
It can be arranged,
but I warn you, nothing nasty.

2043
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,337
You don't have to warn me
about anything.

2044
01:41:15,437 --> 01:41:17,239
Mr. Siegel, considering the utmost gravity

2045
01:41:17,339 --> 01:41:18,806
of the chargesentered against you,

2046
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:23,077
murder in the first degree,
I order you held without bail.

2047
01:41:32,887 --> 01:41:35,490
BEN:
Mickey, where are you-- in Vegas?

2048
01:41:35,590 --> 01:41:37,091
All right, all right.

2049
01:41:37,192 --> 01:41:40,762
Did you do anything
about the cab driver problem?

2050
01:41:40,862 --> 01:41:42,264
Good.

2051
01:41:42,364 --> 01:41:45,600
Did you see the picture
in The Examiner today?

2052
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:47,569
Makes me look
like I got no tan at all.

2053
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:50,638
I look like a marshmallow.

2054
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,107
Do you mean that

2055
01:41:53,208 --> 01:41:54,842
or are you just trying
to make me feel good?

2056
01:41:54,942 --> 01:41:56,444
What do you think-- tan or not tan?

2057
01:41:56,544 --> 01:41:57,479
Tan.

2058
01:41:57,579 --> 01:41:59,881
Really?

2059
01:42:00,114 --> 01:42:02,016
All right.

2060
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:03,651
Look, stay on top of Virginia, will you?

2061
01:42:03,751 --> 01:42:06,654
I want constant reports.
I feel very isolated in here.

2062
01:42:08,523 --> 01:42:09,791
All right. Good.

2063
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,128
Shit.

2064
01:42:32,747 --> 01:42:35,450
VIRGINIA: I think you'll be surprised
at how things will shape up

2065
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:36,684
before we're through.

2066
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:38,486
He's talking about opening in Christmas.

2067
01:42:38,586 --> 01:42:39,921
He's going to open in Christmas.

2068
01:42:40,021 --> 01:42:41,689
Ben is absolutely
determined about that.

2069
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:45,427
Ben is absolutely determined.
Absolutely determined.

2070
01:42:45,527 --> 01:42:47,462
It will open on time.

2071
01:42:49,631 --> 01:42:52,467
You've changed a lot
since I first met you.

2072
01:43:12,987 --> 01:43:15,290
BEN: You called me to tell me
you were leaving Las Vegas,

2073
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:17,359
but you didn't tell me
that Meyer was there, huh?

2074
01:43:17,459 --> 01:43:20,328
I thought it would be better
if I told you in person.

2075
01:43:20,428 --> 01:43:23,231
What did he say?

2076
01:43:23,331 --> 01:43:25,367
He was worried about the cost.

2077
01:43:25,467 --> 01:43:27,101
What else did he say?

2078
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:28,903
I didn't discuss anything else with him.

2079
01:43:29,003 --> 01:43:30,305
He talked to Del Webb.

2080
01:43:30,405 --> 01:43:32,807
Did he ask any specific questions?

2081
01:43:32,907 --> 01:43:34,909
Just about the demolished wall.

2082
01:43:35,009 --> 01:43:36,744
What about the header beam?

2083
01:43:36,844 --> 01:43:38,145
Not exactly

2084
01:43:38,246 --> 01:43:39,881
but he ducked under it.

2085
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:41,015
Ducked?

2086
01:43:41,249 --> 01:43:42,650
It's low.

2087
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:44,286
What do you mean low?

2088
01:43:44,386 --> 01:43:46,488
Too low unless you happen
to be 5'6",

2089
01:43:46,588 --> 01:43:48,923
but it hasn't been fixed yet.

2090
01:43:53,628 --> 01:43:55,162
What was his general attitude?

2091
01:43:55,263 --> 01:43:58,400
Concern, but he never braised his voice.

2092
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,668
He was nice, like he's always been.

2093
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:02,337
What do you mean always?

2094
01:44:02,437 --> 01:44:04,372
As in the past.

2095
01:44:04,472 --> 01:44:05,707
You didn't know him in the past.

2096
01:44:05,807 --> 01:44:07,442
Of course, I did-- through Joey.

2097
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:10,345
Did you fuck him?

2098
01:44:10,445 --> 01:44:12,914
Sure. Why do you ask me that now?

2099
01:44:13,014 --> 01:44:14,215
You fucked Meyer?

2100
01:44:14,316 --> 01:44:15,883
Oh, stop it.
Don't be disgusting.

2101
01:44:15,983 --> 01:44:17,685
I meant Joey and you know it.

2102
01:44:22,657 --> 01:44:24,592
Why is fucking Meyer any more disgusting

2103
01:44:24,692 --> 01:44:25,993
than fucking Joey?

2104
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,496
You don't find fucking Joey disgusting?!

2105
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:30,665
What is it with you and Joey?!

2106
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:32,934
What is the matter with Meyer?!

2107
01:44:33,034 --> 01:44:35,069
You don't want to fuck Meyer?!

2108
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:36,971
Let me tell you something!

2109
01:44:37,071 --> 01:44:38,806
If they can't get it right,

2110
01:44:38,906 --> 01:44:40,808
tell them to tear
the whole fucking thing down

2111
01:44:40,908 --> 01:44:42,777
and start from scratch!

2112
01:44:42,877 --> 01:44:45,647
I have not come this far to have a casino

2113
01:44:45,747 --> 01:44:48,249
that doesn't let me see the fucking pool!

2114
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:50,485
Tear down the fucking casino!

2115
01:44:50,585 --> 01:44:51,653
Tear it down!

2116
01:44:51,753 --> 01:44:53,955
Ben, the cost is going haywire.

2117
01:44:54,055 --> 01:44:56,090
What are you, on their side now?!

2118
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:57,425
Don't say that to me.

2119
01:44:57,525 --> 01:44:59,026
The hell with Meyer Lansky,

2120
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:02,330
The hell with Las Vegas,
and the hell with The Flamingo!

2121
01:45:06,534 --> 01:45:11,205
Look, I talked to Meyer for three minutes

2122
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:12,507
in the middle of a sand blizzard,

2123
01:45:12,607 --> 01:45:14,476
trying to say the things
I thought you would say

2124
01:45:14,576 --> 01:45:17,244
to keep things from seeming
any worse than they already did.

2125
01:45:17,345 --> 01:45:21,383
He even said I sounded like you.

2126
01:45:24,752 --> 01:45:27,021
I just wish the two of us
could be alone in Coney Island,

2127
01:45:27,121 --> 01:45:29,657
eating a couple
of fucking hot dogs at Nathan's.

2128
01:45:33,194 --> 01:45:34,862
Announcer:
Your attention, please.

2129
01:45:34,962 --> 01:45:38,900
This will be the first call
for the Super Chief now ready.

2130
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,469
Board through gates E and F.

2131
01:45:43,104 --> 01:45:44,806
MICKEY:
You'll love Kansas.

2132
01:45:44,906 --> 01:45:46,408
We got you a job at a cab company.

2133
01:45:46,508 --> 01:45:48,142
I'll get used to it.

2134
01:45:48,342 --> 01:45:49,511
What's not to like?

2135
01:45:49,611 --> 01:45:51,546
That's where Dorothy's from
in the Wizard of Oz.

2136
01:45:51,646 --> 01:45:53,047
You mean Dorothy and the Munchkins?

2137
01:45:53,147 --> 01:45:54,749
That's right, Will.

2138
01:45:59,621 --> 01:46:01,723
Don't send any postcards.

2139
01:46:01,823 --> 01:46:05,259
Paper boy: Extra! Extra! Bugsy Siegel
gets off scot-free.

2140
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,096
Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and Clark Gable.

2141
01:46:09,196 --> 01:46:11,265
This is going to be the biggest

2142
01:46:11,365 --> 01:46:12,800
gala opening in history.

2143
01:46:13,901 --> 01:46:16,471
You are a prince of princes.

2144
01:46:16,571 --> 01:46:17,805
Ben.

2145
01:46:17,905 --> 01:46:21,676
See you back at the house.

2146
01:46:21,776 --> 01:46:23,277
You're welcome.

2147
01:46:23,377 --> 01:46:25,913
If you have any more luggage,
feel free to carry it yourself.

2148
01:46:30,084 --> 01:46:34,856
The Flamingo's going to come in
at six million, Ben.

2149
01:46:34,956 --> 01:46:36,458
Listen, Meyer,

2150
01:46:36,558 --> 01:46:37,525
anyone that tells you...

2151
01:46:37,625 --> 01:46:39,193
Ben, I'm on your side.

2152
01:46:39,293 --> 01:46:41,763
I'm doing what I can.
Stop trying to fool me.

2153
01:46:41,863 --> 01:46:43,731
Stop trying to fool yourself.

2154
01:46:47,769 --> 01:46:49,504
You need $3 million.

2155
01:46:49,604 --> 01:46:51,338
If you can come up with two million,

2156
01:46:51,539 --> 01:46:52,807
I can come up with one.

2157
01:46:52,907 --> 01:46:54,442
Charlie knows nothing about this.

2158
01:46:54,542 --> 01:46:55,577
This is between you and me.

2159
01:46:55,677 --> 01:46:57,211
Can you come up
with that kind of money?

2160
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:58,345
No problem.

2161
01:46:58,446 --> 01:47:00,982
Would you stop
with the "No problems"?

2162
01:47:01,082 --> 01:47:03,651
What are you going to do
to get the money?

2163
01:47:03,751 --> 01:47:05,086
All your property--

2164
01:47:05,186 --> 01:47:08,355
your house in Scarsdale,
the cars, the stocks, the bonds

2165
01:47:08,456 --> 01:47:10,892
all belong to Esta and the girls now.

2166
01:47:10,992 --> 01:47:11,959
Am I correct?

2167
01:47:12,059 --> 01:47:13,094
Absolutely.

2168
01:47:13,194 --> 01:47:14,962
Then how will you get $2 million?

2169
01:47:15,062 --> 01:47:16,230
I'll sell things.

2170
01:47:16,430 --> 01:47:17,532
What things?

2171
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,834
I'll sell my house, everything in it...

2172
01:47:19,934 --> 01:47:22,504
Sounds like 200,000 tops.

2173
01:47:22,604 --> 01:47:24,539
Where's the other
million eight coming from?

2174
01:47:28,710 --> 01:47:30,377
You always protected me, Benny.

2175
01:47:30,478 --> 01:47:34,582
When we were kids,
you were always behind me,

2176
01:47:34,682 --> 01:47:36,684
but I can't protect you.

2177
01:47:36,784 --> 01:47:38,319
My shares.

2178
01:47:38,553 --> 01:47:39,721
What about them?

2179
01:47:39,821 --> 01:47:42,156
I own a third of the hotel.

2180
01:47:42,256 --> 01:47:43,791
That's all you've got, Ben.

2181
01:47:43,891 --> 01:47:46,828
You'll end up with nothing.

2182
01:47:46,928 --> 01:47:50,498
But The Flamingo will be there.

2183
01:47:50,598 --> 01:47:52,133
That's not nothing.

2184
01:48:05,012 --> 01:48:07,248
Add your two to this.

2185
01:48:12,086 --> 01:48:13,955
I miss you, Benny.

2186
01:48:24,899 --> 01:48:27,168
Auctioneer #1:
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

2187
01:48:27,268 --> 01:48:28,936
We'll begin this auction...

2188
01:48:29,036 --> 01:48:31,105
Auctioneer #2:
It's a pleasure to offer...

2189
01:48:31,205 --> 01:48:34,141
Auctioneer #3:
Sold to the lady in the white hat.

2190
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:36,143
Auctioneer #4:
27.50, don't lose it.

2191
01:48:36,243 --> 01:48:37,344
Yes or no?

2192
01:48:37,579 --> 01:48:38,946
27.50.

2193
01:48:39,046 --> 01:48:41,849
Auctioneer #5:
Ah, this beautiful oriental rug.

2194
01:48:41,949 --> 01:48:44,051
Sold.

2195
01:48:44,151 --> 01:48:46,420
$400.

2196
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:49,256
No advance of $400.
Sold for $400.

2197
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:51,726
Auctioneer #6:
Lot number 17...

2198
01:48:51,826 --> 01:48:53,695
( AUCTIONEERS CHATTERING )

2199
01:48:53,795 --> 01:48:56,631
Auctioneer #7:
It's not your bid, sir.

2200
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:59,166
Give him back the $600.

2201
01:48:59,266 --> 01:49:02,036
I've decided to sell you
10% of The Flamingo.

2202
01:49:02,136 --> 01:49:03,037
For how much?

2203
01:49:03,137 --> 01:49:04,238
60,000 each.

2204
01:49:04,338 --> 01:49:06,674
I thought the shares were sold.

2205
01:49:06,774 --> 01:49:09,644
If I'm selling them, they can't be sold.

Claim free libra:

2207
01:50:01,095 --> 01:50:02,797
Hey.

2208
01:50:02,897 --> 01:50:04,766
Look who's here.

2209
01:50:04,866 --> 01:50:06,701
How you doing, Ben?

2210
01:50:06,801 --> 01:50:08,703
So?

2211
01:50:08,803 --> 01:50:11,538
What, did you miss the desert?

2212
01:50:11,639 --> 01:50:14,308
That's not why I came.

2213
01:50:14,408 --> 01:50:16,744
Why did you come?

2214
01:50:19,380 --> 01:50:22,249
BEN:
What did she do?

2215
01:50:22,349 --> 01:50:23,350
She fucked you.

2216
01:50:23,450 --> 01:50:25,519
What are you talking about?

2217
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:27,822
There's a numbered
bank account in Switzerland

2218
01:50:27,922 --> 01:50:30,091
With almost $2 million in it.

2219
01:50:30,191 --> 01:50:32,459
So?

2220
01:50:32,694 --> 01:50:34,361
It's hers.

2221
01:50:34,461 --> 01:50:37,932
There's a lot of numbered
bank accounts in Switzerland

2222
01:50:38,032 --> 01:50:39,801
With $2 million in them.

2223
01:50:39,901 --> 01:50:42,203
But only one that was taken
out by Joe Epstein of Chicago

2224
01:50:42,303 --> 01:50:44,105
for Virginia Hill of Beverly Hills.

2225
01:50:45,740 --> 01:50:49,110
I've seen copies
of the deposit records, Ben.

2226
01:50:49,210 --> 01:50:50,244
That's a lie.

2227
01:50:50,344 --> 01:50:51,645
It's not a lie.

2228
01:50:51,746 --> 01:50:53,547
Joe Epstein does work
for me out of Chicago.

2229
01:50:53,647 --> 01:50:54,916
He has no reason to lie to me.

2230
01:50:57,084 --> 01:50:57,985
It's a lie.

2231
01:50:58,085 --> 01:50:58,986
You repeat it,

2232
01:50:59,086 --> 01:51:02,056
I'll break your fucking jaw.

2233
01:51:11,799 --> 01:51:13,200
Can I get a glass of water, Mac?

2234
01:51:55,309 --> 01:51:56,744
BEN:
Do I have to give you a lesson?

2235
01:51:56,844 --> 01:51:59,881
Get those cases out of my sight.

2236
01:51:59,981 --> 01:52:04,085
When we're here,
we don't want to see boxes.

2237
01:52:04,185 --> 01:52:06,620
I haven't seen one of those cases

2238
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:08,389
Where I told you to put it!

2239
01:52:08,489 --> 01:52:09,991
Excuse me. All right?!

2240
01:52:10,091 --> 01:52:11,058
Sorry.

2241
01:52:11,158 --> 01:52:13,761
Hi. I'm Natalie Saint Clair.

2242
01:52:13,861 --> 01:52:16,497
Mr. Webb suggested I come talk to you

2243
01:52:16,597 --> 01:52:19,133
about possibly working at The Flamingo.

2244
01:52:19,233 --> 01:52:20,167
Yeah, as what?

2245
01:52:20,267 --> 01:52:22,069
I don't know.
Anything.

2246
01:52:22,169 --> 01:52:24,571
If you could invent a job,
what would it be?

2247
01:52:24,772 --> 01:52:26,507
Uh... a bartender.

2248
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:27,875
A bartender.

2249
01:52:27,975 --> 01:52:29,310
A hatcheck girl.

2250
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:30,845
BEN:
Did you come from Hollywood?

2251
01:52:30,945 --> 01:52:31,946
Yes, I did.

2252
01:52:32,046 --> 01:52:33,915
You're a very beautiful girl.

2253
01:52:34,015 --> 01:52:35,282
Did you fly here?

2254
01:52:35,382 --> 01:52:39,186
No, I love to fly,
but I couldn't afford it.

2255
01:52:39,286 --> 01:52:41,222
VIRGINIA:
Looking for a girl who likes to fly?

2256
01:52:42,790 --> 01:52:43,958
Excuse me, would you?

2257
01:52:49,864 --> 01:52:50,832
Virginia!

2258
01:52:50,932 --> 01:52:52,800
I want to talk to you.

2259
01:52:52,900 --> 01:52:55,302
Virginia... sugar.

2260
01:52:57,604 --> 01:53:00,507
Virginia, we don't have time for this.

2261
01:53:02,209 --> 01:53:04,011
Shit, Virginia.

2262
01:53:04,111 --> 01:53:05,512
You almost got me in the head again.

2263
01:53:05,612 --> 01:53:09,817
Yeah? How do you think I feel
watching you chase some bimbo?

2264
01:53:09,917 --> 01:53:12,353
I wasn't chasing her.
she's an employee.

2265
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:13,988
An employee of what?

2266
01:53:14,088 --> 01:53:14,956
The Flamingo.

2267
01:53:15,056 --> 01:53:16,858
She's going to be a hatcheck girl.

2268
01:53:16,958 --> 01:53:18,960
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

2269
01:53:19,060 --> 01:53:22,363
That's baccarat crystal
you just shattered.

2270
01:53:22,463 --> 01:53:24,832
I don't care.
You just shattered us.

2271
01:53:24,932 --> 01:53:26,500
I'm not defending myself.

2272
01:53:26,600 --> 01:53:29,703
A woman wanted a job.
What are you doing?

2273
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:32,406
Leaving, and don't try to stop me.

2274
01:53:32,506 --> 01:53:36,143
I should have gone the day
you killed Harry Greenberg.

2275
01:53:36,243 --> 01:53:37,111
Where are you going?

2276
01:53:37,211 --> 01:53:38,745
Wherever I feel like.

2277
01:53:38,846 --> 01:53:40,514
Someplace where somebody knows

2278
01:53:40,614 --> 01:53:42,283
about a numbered bank account?

2279
01:53:44,051 --> 01:53:47,288
What fantasy have you concocted
in your sick mind?

2280
01:53:47,388 --> 01:53:49,556
Why don't you just ask
what you want to ask?

2281
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:51,492
How much money you got
in that account?

2282
01:53:51,592 --> 01:53:53,660
Why? You want to sell me a few shares

2283
01:53:53,861 --> 01:53:55,329
in The Flamingo?

2284
01:53:55,429 --> 01:53:57,264
You gave me 5 3/4%.

2285
01:53:57,364 --> 01:54:00,101
You want to sell me 10
like you did to your friends?

2286
01:54:00,201 --> 01:54:04,171
That would come
to about 300%, or is it four?

2287
01:54:04,271 --> 01:54:06,573
Just answer the question
that I'm really asking.

2288
01:54:06,673 --> 01:54:09,110
How much money have you stolen from this hotel?

2289
01:54:09,210 --> 01:54:11,512
I've done 100 times the amount of work

2290
01:54:11,612 --> 01:54:14,515
I would have to do
to justify taking anything.

2291
01:54:14,615 --> 01:54:16,083
How much did you get your hands on?

2292
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,886
Nothing, and I could have taken a lot.

2293
01:54:18,986 --> 01:54:20,787
And you wouldn't have known the difference

2294
01:54:20,888 --> 01:54:23,958
because you're an irresponsible,
unrealistic, unreliable,

2295
01:54:24,058 --> 01:54:25,960
undependable, philandering fuck!

2296
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:28,029
I should have taken something,

2297
01:54:28,129 --> 01:54:30,431
but it isn't in me

2298
01:54:30,531 --> 01:54:33,334
to violate the trust
of the one person in my life

2299
01:54:33,434 --> 01:54:36,870
I have been stupid enough
to give myself to,

2300
01:54:36,971 --> 01:54:39,573
the one person I've been
stupid enough to love.

2301
01:54:39,673 --> 01:54:41,308
How much money you got in that account?

2302
01:54:41,408 --> 01:54:42,543
How much did you steal?

2303
01:54:42,643 --> 01:54:43,744
Damn you!

2304
01:54:43,978 --> 01:54:45,512
How much?

2305
01:54:45,612 --> 01:54:48,515
Bye-bye, Ben.
You're on your own.

2306
01:55:06,968 --> 01:55:09,403
CHARLIE: First of all, let me say
how much it means to me

2307
01:55:09,503 --> 01:55:11,038
that all of you've taken the time

2308
01:55:11,138 --> 01:55:12,673
to fly down here and pay your respects

2309
01:55:12,773 --> 01:55:16,043
to a lovely, Italian exile
with a swollen prostate gland.

2310
01:55:17,611 --> 01:55:18,946
It breaks my heart

2311
01:55:19,046 --> 01:55:20,814
that the tragic mess
with The Flamingo Hotel

2312
01:55:21,015 --> 01:55:22,083
is being perpetrated

2313
01:55:22,183 --> 01:55:23,817
by one of my dearest friends
in the world--

2314
01:55:24,051 --> 01:55:25,419
Benny Siegel.

2315
01:55:26,720 --> 01:55:29,090
Here's where we stand right now.

2316
01:55:29,190 --> 01:55:33,060
The Flamingo's going
to open on Christmas Day.

2317
01:55:33,160 --> 01:55:34,861
My hotel friends in the know tell me

2318
01:55:34,962 --> 01:55:37,631
it's the stupidest fucking time
we could ever pick

2319
01:55:37,731 --> 01:55:41,368
to throw open a new joint to the public.

2320
01:55:41,468 --> 01:55:43,937
Total cost of the hotel
is now $6 million,

2321
01:55:44,038 --> 01:55:47,608
which is five million more
than the original figure.

2322
01:55:47,708 --> 01:55:49,176
To get the last few million he needed

2323
01:55:49,276 --> 01:55:51,078
to finish construction,

2324
01:55:51,178 --> 01:55:54,982
Benny's had to sell
400% of the hotel.

2325
01:55:55,082 --> 01:55:56,283
A lot of people

2326
01:55:56,383 --> 01:55:58,219
who think they got
major shares in this joint

2327
01:55:58,319 --> 01:55:59,620
are famous individuals,

2328
01:55:59,720 --> 01:56:01,922
like movie stars
and wealthy businessmen

2329
01:56:02,023 --> 01:56:03,590
with political connections,

2330
01:56:03,690 --> 01:56:05,192
who ain't just going
to get stiffed

2331
01:56:05,292 --> 01:56:07,028
when their time comes
to collect.

2332
01:56:07,128 --> 01:56:08,729
Not that there will be
a time to collect

2333
01:56:08,829 --> 01:56:10,297
'cause chances are
this whole thing

2334
01:56:10,397 --> 01:56:14,201
is going to be a total,
fucking fiasco.

2335
01:56:14,301 --> 01:56:15,402
All of this is nothing

2336
01:56:15,502 --> 01:56:18,439
compared to the more
serious matter at hand

2337
01:56:18,539 --> 01:56:23,077
which is the question
of stealing.

2338
01:56:23,177 --> 01:56:24,611
My banking friends
in Switzerland

2339
01:56:24,711 --> 01:56:26,947
tell me
this Virginia Hill--

2340
01:56:27,048 --> 01:56:28,915
this broad Joey A.
used to fuck

2341
01:56:29,016 --> 01:56:31,085
and Benny's
so head and heels over--

2342
01:56:31,185 --> 01:56:34,121
she's pulled off a couple
of million in loose change

2343
01:56:34,221 --> 01:56:37,858
for herself
from this here deal.

2344
01:56:38,092 --> 01:56:40,961
For me,

2345
01:56:41,062 --> 01:56:44,065
there's a simple, basic question
we have to answer.

2346
01:56:44,165 --> 01:56:46,767
Did this broad
steal this money

2347
01:56:46,867 --> 01:56:49,370
without Benny knowing
anything about it,

2348
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:55,309
or was she just fronting
for Benny like a shill?

2349
01:56:55,409 --> 01:56:57,778
Anybody that thinks
Bugsy Siegel

2350
01:56:57,878 --> 01:56:59,280
didn't know about this
is crazy.

2351
01:56:59,380 --> 01:57:01,415
Benny Siegel.

2352
01:57:01,515 --> 01:57:03,550
There's no need
for disrespect.

2353
01:57:03,650 --> 01:57:05,552
Oh, yeah?

2354
01:57:05,652 --> 01:57:08,021
What about his disrespect to us?

2355
01:57:08,122 --> 01:57:11,158
Benny's got to take the rap.

2356
01:57:11,258 --> 01:57:13,194
I agree with Joey and Frank.

2357
01:57:13,294 --> 01:57:14,895
How do all the rest of you feel?

2358
01:57:15,129 --> 01:57:16,197
All:
I agree.

2359
01:57:16,297 --> 01:57:17,631
Meyer?

2360
01:57:17,731 --> 01:57:21,202
I don't believe Benny knew
what Virginia Hill was doing.

2361
01:57:21,302 --> 01:57:23,070
He was blinded by love.

2362
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:25,206
Benny's always put women first.

2363
01:57:25,306 --> 01:57:26,973
That's what makes him Benny.

2364
01:57:27,074 --> 01:57:29,210
Only this time it's one women
that's got him

2365
01:57:29,310 --> 01:57:32,012
instead of the whole
damn female race.

2366
01:57:32,113 --> 01:57:35,048
So I believe Benny would accept
anything that broad told him.

2367
01:57:35,149 --> 01:57:38,585
There's no chance
he stole from us.

2368
01:57:38,685 --> 01:57:41,322
No chance he knew
about any stealing.

2369
01:57:41,422 --> 01:57:44,024
Benny's got
one basic problem--

2370
01:57:44,125 --> 01:57:45,692
he doesn't respect money.

2371
01:57:45,792 --> 01:57:48,429
He's not even interested
in money for himself

2372
01:57:48,529 --> 01:57:49,663
off this deal.

2373
01:57:49,763 --> 01:57:51,532
He's interested in the idea.

2374
01:57:51,632 --> 01:57:52,699
What idea?

2375
01:57:52,799 --> 01:57:54,000

2376
01:57:54,101 --> 01:57:56,303

Benny's a dreamer.

2377
01:57:56,403 --> 01:57:58,939
I'm not excusing it.
I'm explaining it.

2378
01:57:59,140 --> 01:58:00,341
I'm a businessman.

2379
01:58:00,441 --> 01:58:02,008
As far as I'm concerned,

2380
01:58:02,109 --> 01:58:05,846
Anything that broad took
Benny's got to make good on.

2381
01:58:05,946 --> 01:58:08,449
What do you want
to do about it, Meyer...

2382
01:58:08,549 --> 01:58:10,217
As a businessman?

2383
01:58:10,317 --> 01:58:12,986
Give him till Christmas,
when the hotel opens,

2384
01:58:13,220 --> 01:58:14,121
see if it works.

2385
01:58:14,221 --> 01:58:16,089
If it does,
we'll be happy.

2386
01:58:16,190 --> 01:58:18,559

2387

What if The Flamingo
goes bust?

2388
01:58:24,131 --> 01:58:27,434

of further refinements
in the hotel,

2412
02:01:09,863 --> 02:01:12,232
which will make The Flamingo
an even greater place,

you'll protect Virginia.

02:05:51,311 --> 02:05:53,013
I love you, Ben.

2477
02:06:46,867 --> 02:06:50,737
You know something, Mick?
You got Virginia all wrong.

2478
02:06:50,837 --> 02:06:54,240
Tonight, she was willing
to fly for me.

2479
02:06:54,340 --> 02:06:57,010
I don't want to talk
about Virginia, Ben.

2480
02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:02,082
All right.
Good night.

2481
02:07:07,253 --> 02:07:09,055
( HUMMING )

2482
02:07:43,857 --> 02:07:46,059
BEN:
I am on to your racket.

2483
02:07:46,159 --> 02:07:48,561
MAN: You've got the blueprints
all drawn, haven't you?

2484
02:07:48,661 --> 02:07:51,397
Yeah. You got a line, sister,

2485
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:54,968
but it don't make a wife
for a right guy,

2486
02:07:55,068 --> 02:07:56,803
so I'm telling you straight

2487
02:07:56,903 --> 02:07:59,840
forget that you ever seen him...

2488
02:07:59,940 --> 02:08:01,808
Yeah. You got a line, sister,

2489
02:08:01,908 --> 02:08:04,911
but it don't make a wife
for a right guy,

2490
02:08:05,011 --> 02:08:06,679
so I'm telling you straight

2491
02:08:06,780 --> 02:08:08,715
forget that you ever seen him

2492
02:08:08,815 --> 02:08:11,117
and if you don't get
what I mean,

2493
02:08:11,217 --> 02:08:14,620
this might get...
give you an idea.

2494
02:08:14,721 --> 02:08:15,756
MAN:
Now, listen, mister,

2495
02:08:15,856 --> 02:08:18,391
before you came in here,
I was worrying about henry...

2496
02:08:18,491 --> 02:08:19,592
( GUNSHOT )

2497
02:08:19,692 --> 02:08:20,861
I figured
I wouldn't marry him

2498
02:08:20,961 --> 02:08:23,797
because he is
a regular guy, but now...

2499
02:08:23,897 --> 02:08:25,331
( GUNSHOT )

2500
02:08:27,167 --> 02:08:28,468
I'm so sorry.
I beg your pardon.

2501
02:08:28,701 --> 02:08:30,703
But now...

2502
02:08:30,804 --> 02:08:34,307
Now I'm going to marry him.
Is there anything else?

2503
02:08:34,407 --> 02:08:36,209
BEN:
No.

2504
02:08:36,309 --> 02:08:37,377
Then what's the trouble?

2505
02:08:40,046 --> 02:08:42,816
Two bucks for what?

2506
02:08:42,916 --> 02:08:45,018
One beer
and some phony champagne?

2507
02:08:45,118 --> 02:08:46,887
That's right.

2508
02:08:46,987 --> 02:08:48,488
Split it between you.

2509
02:08:48,588 --> 02:08:50,723
Ain't you being
a little hasty, pal?

2510
02:08:50,824 --> 02:08:52,492
You're so cheap,
you're wholesale...

2511
02:08:54,895 --> 02:08:58,064
( AUDIO SLOWING DOWN )

2512
02:08:59,732 --> 02:09:02,668
That's all it's worth.

2513
02:09:02,769 --> 02:09:05,772
You don't want to get
into no trouble, do you?

2514
02:09:05,872 --> 02:09:09,442
I just had this suit pressed,
and it was...

2515
02:10:08,134 --> 02:10:09,870
VIRGINIA:
And what about the...

2516
02:10:09,970 --> 02:10:11,872
during the electric storm?

2517
02:10:11,972 --> 02:10:13,907
Del:
Well, we had water.

2518
02:10:14,007 --> 02:10:15,208
VIRGINIA:
Hello, Moe.

2519
02:10:15,308 --> 02:10:16,977
Virginia,
this is Gus Greenbaum.

2520
02:10:17,077 --> 02:10:18,311
Meyer Lansky sent us.

2521
02:10:18,411 --> 02:10:20,881
We're taking over control
of The Flamingo hotel.

2522
02:10:20,981 --> 02:10:24,284
Ben Siegel controls The Flamingo.

2523
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:26,119
Bugsy Siegel is dead.

2524
02:10:26,219 --> 02:10:28,454
The Flamingo belongs to us.
