1
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:34,380
I need a father who's a role model,

2
00:00:35,306 --> 00:00:36,711
not some horny geek boy

3
00:00:36,712 --> 00:00:40,099
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girlfriend home from school.

4
00:00:42,808 --> 00:00:43,942
What a lame-o.

5
00:00:47,513 --> 00:00:49,018
Someone really should just...

6
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:50,640
put him out of his misery.

7
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:55,250
You want me to kill him for you?

8
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:04,787
Yeah.

9
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,188
Would you?

10
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,408
<font color=#00ffff><i>My name is Lester Burnham.</i></font>

11
00:01:22,481 --> 00:01:24,644
<font color=#00ffff><i>This is my neighborhood.</i></font>

12
00:01:25,718 --> 00:01:27,453
<font color=#00ffff><i>This is my street.</i></font>

13
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,788
<font color=#00ffff><i>This is my life.</i></font>

14
00:01:31,657 --> 00:01:33,338
<font color=#00ffff><i>I'm 42 years old.</i></font>

15
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:34,997
<font color=#00ffff><i>In less than a year,</i></font>

16
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:36,651
<font color=#00ffff><i>I'll be dead.</i></font>

17
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:44,526
<font color=#00ffff><i>Of course,</i></font>

18
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:46,501
<font color=#00ffff><i>I don't know that yet.</i></font>

19
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,525
<font color=#00ffff><i>And in a way,</i></font>

20
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:53,776
<font color=#00ffff><i>I'm dead already.</i></font>

21
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:05,422
<font color=#00ffff><i>Look at me.</i></font>

22
00:02:06,323 --> 00:02:07,785
<font color=#00ffff><i>Jerking off in the shower.</i></font>

23
00:02:09,495 --> 00:02:11,853
<font color=#00ffff><i>This will be the high point of my day.</i></font>

24
00:02:12,154 --> 00:02:14,562
<font color=#00ffff><i>It's all downhill from here.</i></font>

25
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,534
<font color=#00ffff><i>That's my wife, Carolyn.</i></font>

26
00:02:23,308 --> 00:02:27,302
<font color=#00ffff><i>See the way the handle on those pruning
shears matches her gardening clogs?</i></font>

27
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,840
<font color=#00ffff><i>That's not an accident.</i></font>

28
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:31,741
Hush, Bitsy!

29
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,321
Hush. What is wrong with you?

30
00:02:35,347 --> 00:02:36,946
<font color=#00ffff><i>That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.</i></font>

31
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,681
<font color=#00ffff><i>And that's his lover,</i></font>

32
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:41,125
<font color=#00ffff><i>Jim.</i></font>

33
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,208
You spoil her. Bitsy.
Me.

34
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:45,185
No bark. Come inside now.

35
00:02:45,463 --> 00:02:47,432
Come on. Yes. Inside.
Good morning, Jim!

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,961
Good morning, Carolyn.

37
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:54,067
I love your tie!
That color!

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,340
I just love your roses.

39
00:02:56,341 --> 00:02:58,634
How do you get them to flourish like this?

40
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:02,742
Well, I'll tell you,
eggshells and Miracle-Gro.

41
00:03:03,015 --> 00:03:04,252
I've never heard that.
<font color=#00ffff><i>Man.</i></font>

42
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,143
<font color=#00ffff><i>I get exhausted just watching her.</i></font>

43
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,040
<font color=#00ffff><i>She wasn't always like this.</i></font>

44
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:11,980
<font color=#00ffff><i>She used to be happy.</i></font>

45
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,426
<font color=#00ffff><i>We used to be happy.</i></font>

46
00:03:18,296 --> 00:03:19,666
<font color=#00ffff><i>My daughter Jane.</i></font>

47
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:21,826
<font color=#00ffff><i>Only child.</i></font>

48
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:26,735
<font color=#00ffff><i>Janie's a pretty typical teenager.</i></font>

49
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:30,538
<font color=#00ffff><i>Angry, insecure, confused.</i></font>

50
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:33,801
<font color=#00ffff><i>I wish I could tell her
that's all going to pass,</i></font>

51
00:03:34,827 --> 00:03:36,468
<font color=#00ffff><i>but I don't want to lie to her.</i></font>

52
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:44,350
Jane, honey, are you trying
to look unattractive?

53
00:03:44,723 --> 00:03:45,556
Yes.

54
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,312
Congratulations.
You've succeeded admirably.

55
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:51,628
Lester, could you make me
a little later please,

56
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:53,154
because I'm not quite late enough.

57
00:03:56,968 --> 00:03:58,136
Nice going, Dad.

58
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:02,836
<font color=#00ffff><i>Both my wife and daughter think
I'm this gigantic loser.</i></font>

59
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:05,300
<font color=#00ffff><i>And they're right.</i></font>

60
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:08,679
<font color=#00ffff><i>I have lost something.</i></font>

61
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,308
<font color=#00ffff><i>I'm not exactly sure what it is but,</i></font>

62
00:04:12,684 --> 00:04:14,945
<font color=#00ffff><i>I know I didn't always feel this...</i></font>

63
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,455
<font color=#00ffff><i>sedated.</i></font>

64
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,053
<font color=#00ffff><i>But you know what?</i></font>

65
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:22,534
<font color=#00ffff><i>It's never too late,</i></font>

66
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:24,254
<font color=#00ffff><i>to get it back.</i></font>

67
00:04:25,731 --> 00:04:26,570
Hello.

68
00:04:26,996 --> 00:04:29,153
This is Lester Burnham from
Media Monthly magazine.

69
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,961
I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please.

70
00:04:32,137 --> 00:04:34,047
Well, we're all under a deadline here.

71
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,857
You see, there's some basic information,

72
00:04:35,858 --> 00:04:38,699
about your product launch that isn't
even covered in your press release so...

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,400
I...

74
00:04:41,012 --> 00:04:41,699
Yeah.

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,379
I c... can I ask you a question?

76
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,333
Who. Who is Tamblin?
Does he... Does he exist?

77
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:47,433
Because he doesn't ever seem
to come in.

78
00:04:48,886 --> 00:04:50,719
Yeah. Ok.
I'll leave my number.

79
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:55,026
It's 555-0199.

80
00:04:55,894 --> 00:04:57,235
Lester Burnham.

81
00:04:57,636 --> 00:04:58,721
Thank you!

82
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,283
Hey, Les.

83
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:04,495
You got a minute?

84
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:06,967
For you Brad, I got five!

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,982
So, yeah,

86
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:12,634
I'm sure you can understand our need
to cut corners around here.

87
00:05:12,911 --> 00:05:13,911
Oh, sure.

88
00:05:14,295 --> 00:05:16,379
Times are tight.
You got to free up some cash.

89
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,514
You got to spend money
to make money.

90
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:18,829
Right?

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,251
Exactly.

92
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,596
Like the time that Mr. Flournoy used
the company MasterCard,

93
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:25,656
to pay for that hooker and...

94
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:29,788
she used the card numbers and stayed at
the St. Regis for what was it, three months?

95
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:32,473
That's unsubstantiated gossip...
That's $50,000,

96
00:05:32,774 --> 00:05:33,874
that's somebody's salary.

97
00:05:33,899 --> 00:05:34,865
That's somebody who's going
to get fired,

98
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,993
because Craig has to pay women
to fuck him!

99
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:38,169
Jesus!

100
00:05:38,937 --> 00:05:39,805
I mean, calm down.

101
00:05:40,906 --> 00:05:42,534
Nobody's getting fired yet.

102
00:05:43,508 --> 00:05:46,831
That's why we're having everyone
write out a job description

103
00:05:46,957 --> 00:05:49,663
mapping out in detail how they contribute.

104
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,874
That way management can assess,

105
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,244
who's valuable...

106
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:54,882
and who's expendable.

107
00:05:56,455 --> 00:05:57,851
It's just business.

108
00:06:00,024 --> 00:06:02,489
I've been writing for this magazine
for 14 years Brad.

109
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,363
You've been here how long?
A whole month?

110
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,618
I'm one of the good guys, Les.

111
00:06:07,665 --> 00:06:09,032
I'm trying to level with you.

112
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,694
This is your one chance
to save your job.

113
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,675
There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.

114
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:20,205
Well, you don't think it's weird
and kind of fascist?

115
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,224
Possibly but you don't want to be unemployed.

116
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,603
Alright, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan

117
00:06:24,604 --> 00:06:25,816
because it's more convenient that way.

118
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,896
Could you be a little bit more dramatic, please.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,422
So, we finally got new neighbors.

120
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,419
You know, if the Lomans had let me represent
them instead of the Real Estate King,

121
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,219
that house would never have sat
on the market for six months.

122
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,661
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.

123
00:06:41,133 --> 00:06:42,776
Their sycamore?

124
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:46,498
Come on. A substantial portion of the root
structure was on our property.

125
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,608
You know that.

126
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:49,564
How can you call it their sycamore?

127
00:06:49,641 --> 00:06:50,931
I wouldn't have the heart to just,

128
00:06:50,932 --> 00:06:54,638
cut down something if it wasn't partially
mine which of course it was.

129
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:08,350
Mom, do we always have to listen
to this elevator music?

130
00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:12,561
No. No, we don't.

131
00:07:12,831 --> 00:07:16,767
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meal that I'm about to eat,

132
00:07:16,835 --> 00:07:18,570
you can listen to whatever you like.

133
00:07:22,841 --> 00:07:24,207
So Janie,

134
00:07:24,808 --> 00:07:25,943
how was school?

135
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:28,078
It was ok.

136
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:30,582
Just ok?

137
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,978
No Dad,

138
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:35,146
it was spectacular.

139
00:07:38,824 --> 00:07:41,159
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today?

140
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:44,227
They've hired this efficiency expert,

141
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:47,026
this really friendly guy named Brad.

142
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,168
How perfect is that?

143
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:51,661
And he's basically there to make
it seem they're justified,

144
00:07:51,803 --> 00:07:55,161
in firing somebody because they couldn't
just come out and say that, could they?

145
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,740
No, no. That would just be too honest.

146
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:00,936
So they've asked us you couldn't possibly
care less, could you?

147
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,041
What do you expect?

148
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:07,882
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.

149
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:11,818
I mean hello,

150
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:13,819
you've barely even spoken to me
for months.

151
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,225
What? You're Mother of the Year?

152
00:08:23,602 --> 00:08:25,425
You treat her like an employee.

153
00:08:26,226 --> 00:08:26,860
What?

154
00:08:29,574 --> 00:08:30,272
What?

155
00:08:33,543 --> 00:08:34,905
I'm going to get some ice cream.

156
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:44,588
Janie.

157
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:47,494
I'm sorry I...

158
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:49,219
I haven't been more...

159
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,328
available.

160
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:52,926
I'm just... I...

161
00:08:55,934 --> 00:08:58,970
You know, you don't always
have to wait for me to come to you.

162
00:09:00,638 --> 00:09:01,656
Oh, great.

163
00:09:01,957 --> 00:09:03,198
So now it's my fault?

164
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,876
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fault. It...

165
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,020
Janie, what happened?

166
00:09:09,621 --> 00:09:11,044
We used to be pals.

167
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:53,475
I will sell this house today.

168
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:06,956
I will sell this house today.

169
00:11:23,181 --> 00:11:25,807
I will sell this house today.

170
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:35,167
Welcome.

171
00:11:35,468 --> 00:11:36,790
I'm Carolyn Burnham.

172
00:11:37,162 --> 00:11:39,722
This living room is very dramatic.

173
00:11:40,298 --> 00:11:43,199
Wait till you see the native stone fireplace!

174
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:46,543
A simple cream could really lighten things up.

175
00:11:46,544 --> 00:11:48,563
You could even put in a skylight.

176
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,737
Well, why don't we go into the kitchen?

177
00:11:53,812 --> 00:11:56,013
It's a dream come true for any cook.

178
00:11:57,182 --> 00:11:59,049
Just filled with positive energy?

179
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:05,314
And you'll be surprised how much a ceiling fan
can cut down on your energy costs.

180
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,724
You know, you could have some fun
backyard get-togethers out here.

181
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,768
The ad said this pool was lagoon-like.
There's nothing lagoon-like about it.

182
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:19,509
Except for maybe the bugs.

183
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,629
There aren't even any plants out here.

184
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,020
What do you call this?

185
00:12:23,321 --> 00:12:24,642
Is this not a plant?

186
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:28,246
If you have a problem with the plants,
I can always call my landscape architect.

187
00:12:28,313 --> 00:12:29,742
Solved.

188
00:12:29,743 --> 00:12:32,909
I mean, I think lagoon,
I think waterfall, I think tropical.

189
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:35,819
This is a cement hole.

190
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,285
I have some tiki torches in the garage.

191
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:17,491
Shut up! Stop it!
You weak. You baby!

192
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:20,231
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

193
00:14:06,144 --> 00:14:07,305
Who are you looking for?

194
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:09,607
My parents are coming tonight.

195
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:14,145
They're trying to, you know,
take an active interest in me.

196
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:17,288
Gross. I hate it when my mom does that.

197
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:19,043
They're such assholes.

198
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:21,082
Why can't they just have their own lives?

199
00:14:25,869 --> 00:14:28,562
What makes you sure she wants us
to be there, did she ask us to come?

200
00:14:28,706 --> 00:14:32,007
Of course not. She doesn't want us
to know how important this is to her.

201
00:14:32,077 --> 00:14:34,138
But she's been practicing her steps
for weeks.

202
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,983
Well, I'll bet she's going to resent it,

203
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,782
and I'm missing the James
Bond marathon on T.N.T.

204
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:40,703
Lester, this is important.

205
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,636
I'm sensing a real distance
growing between you and Jane.

206
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:44,797
Growing?

207
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:46,121
She hates me.

208
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:48,035
She's just willful.

209
00:14:48,436 --> 00:14:49,884
She hates you too.

210
00:14:59,603 --> 00:15:02,297
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.
Pardon me.

211
00:15:02,473 --> 00:15:04,164
Hi! Patty!

212
00:15:05,142 --> 00:15:07,311
<i>Now, for your halftime entertainment,</i>

213
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:11,112
<i>Rockwell High's award-winning
Dancing Spartanettes!</i>

214
00:15:12,183 --> 00:15:13,811
We can leave right after this, right?

215
00:17:28,352 --> 00:17:30,180
Shit. They're still here.

216
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:32,155
Janie!

217
00:17:32,724 --> 00:17:34,919
Hey, I really enjoyed that.

218
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:37,060
Congratulations, honey. You were great.

219
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:38,085
I didn't win anything.

220
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:39,829
Hi. I'm Lester, Janie's dad.

221
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,991
Hi.

222
00:17:45,035 --> 00:17:47,097
This is my friend, Angela Hayes.

223
00:17:47,771 --> 00:17:48,802
Ok.

224
00:17:49,603 --> 00:17:50,838
Good to meet you.

225
00:17:50,908 --> 00:17:52,867
You were also good tonight, very...

226
00:17:54,768 --> 00:17:55,910
precise.

227
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,815
Thanks.
Nice to meet you, Angela.

228
00:17:58,883 --> 00:17:59,668
Honey.

229
00:18:00,169 --> 00:18:01,713
I am so proud of you.

230
00:18:01,986 --> 00:18:04,886
You know, I watched you very closely.
You didn't screw up once.

231
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:07,558
Ok.

232
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:09,235
We have to go.

233
00:18:09,828 --> 00:18:11,558
So what are you girls doing now?

234
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:12,388
Dad.

235
00:18:12,963 --> 00:18:14,249
We're going out for pizza.

236
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,353
Oh really? Do you need a ride?
We can give you a ride. I have a car.

237
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,477
You want to come with us?

238
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,297
Thanks, but I have a car.

239
00:18:20,471 --> 00:18:23,205
You have a car.
Oh that's great. That's great.

240
00:18:23,474 --> 00:18:26,411
Janie's thinking about getting a car,
too soon, aren't you?

241
00:18:26,411 --> 00:18:27,235
Dad!

242
00:18:27,636 --> 00:18:29,044
Mom's waiting for you.

243
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:34,277
Well, it was very nice meeting you, Angela.

244
00:18:35,552 --> 00:18:37,743
Any friend of Janie's is a...

245
00:18:38,569 --> 00:18:40,007
friend of mine.

246
00:18:44,662 --> 00:18:45,649
Well...

247
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:49,023
I'll be seeing you around, then.

248
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,287
Could he be any more...

249
00:18:56,088 --> 00:18:57,101
pathetic?

250
00:18:57,875 --> 00:18:59,244
I think he's sweet.

251
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:04,310
And I think he and your mother
have not had sex in a long time.

252
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,894
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It's the weirdest thing.</i></font>

253
00:19:25,069 --> 00:19:27,927
<font color="#00ffff"><i>I feel like I've been in a coma
for about 20 years,</i></font>

254
00:19:28,606 --> 00:19:30,869
<font color="#00ffff"><i>and I'm just now waking up.</i></font>

255
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:05,407
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Spectacular.</i></font>

256
00:20:14,385 --> 00:20:17,752
I'm so sorry my dad was weird tonight.

257
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:20,782
That's ok.

258
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:23,591
I'm used to guys drooling over me.

259
00:20:25,663 --> 00:20:27,531
It started when I was about 12.

260
00:20:28,699 --> 00:20:30,327
I'd go to dinner with my parents.

261
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:33,330
Every thursday night, red lobster.

262
00:20:34,105 --> 00:20:36,674
Every guy there would stare at me
when I walked in.

263
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:38,802
And I knew what they were thinking,

264
00:20:39,377 --> 00:20:42,213
just like I knew guys at school thought
about me when they jerked off.

265
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,380
Vomit.

266
00:20:44,681 --> 00:20:45,779
No. I liked it.

267
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,698
I still like it.

268
00:20:48,424 --> 00:20:51,382
If people I don't even know look at me
and want to fuck me it means...

269
00:20:52,383 --> 00:20:54,486
I really have a shot at being a model.

270
00:20:55,159 --> 00:20:56,457
Which is great,

271
00:20:57,528 --> 00:21:01,389
because there's nothing worse in life
than being ordinary.

272
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:07,504
I really think it'll happen for you.

273
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:10,408
I know.

274
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:14,107
Because everything that was
meant to happen does...

275
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:15,965
eventually.

276
00:21:41,771 --> 00:21:42,996
Asshole.

277
00:22:48,406 --> 00:22:49,212
<i>Hello?</i>

278
00:22:50,713 --> 00:22:51,764
<i>Hello?</i>

279
00:23:08,092 --> 00:23:08,988
Hello?

280
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:10,156
Why'd you call me?

281
00:23:10,428 --> 00:23:11,462
<i>I didn't.</i>

282
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,990
Well, my phone just rang and
I answered it, and somebody hung up.

283
00:23:15,066 --> 00:23:17,211
And I star 69 and I called you back.

284
00:23:17,212 --> 00:23:18,962
Well, I was in the shower.

285
00:23:24,541 --> 00:23:25,568
Gross!

286
00:23:41,526 --> 00:23:43,754
Ricky! Breakfast!

287
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,364
Be right there.

288
00:23:57,274 --> 00:23:57,912
Mom.

289
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:58,439
Hello.

290
00:23:58,609 --> 00:24:00,576
I don't eat bacon, remember?

291
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:04,482
I'm sorry.
I must've forgotten.

292
00:24:16,593 --> 00:24:17,862
What's new in the world, Dad?

293
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:22,030
This country is going straight to hell.

294
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,007
Are you expecting anyone?
No.

295
00:24:36,313 --> 00:24:37,145
No.

296
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:45,796
Hi.

297
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:47,037
Welcome to the neighborhood.

298
00:24:47,158 --> 00:24:49,426
It's just a little something from our garden.
Except for the pasta.

299
00:24:49,427 --> 00:24:51,120
We got that at Fallaci's. Right.

300
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:52,128
It's unbelievably fresh.

301
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:55,758
You just you drop it in the water,
and it's done.

302
00:24:56,333 --> 00:24:57,418
Jim Olmeyer.

303
00:24:57,819 --> 00:24:59,719
Two doors down.
Welcome to the neighborhood.

304
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:02,103
Colonel Frank Fitts, U.S. Marine Corps.

305
00:25:02,373 --> 00:25:03,424
It's nice to meet you.

306
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,487
This is my partner.

307
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:05,927
Jim Berkley, but call me J.B.

308
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:07,548
Hey let's cut to chase, ok?

309
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,175
What are you guys selling?

310
00:25:11,047 --> 00:25:13,343
Nothing. We just wanted to say hi
to our new neighbors.

311
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:14,723
Yeah, yeah...

312
00:25:15,649 --> 00:25:17,388
But you said you're partners so...

313
00:25:18,089 --> 00:25:19,171
what's your business?

314
00:25:20,591 --> 00:25:21,463
Well...

315
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:24,543
he is a tax attorney.

316
00:25:24,695 --> 00:25:26,464
And he's an anesthesiologist.

317
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:40,134
How come these faggots
always have to rub it in your face?

318
00:25:42,011 --> 00:25:43,771
How can they be so shameless?

319
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:48,280
That's the whole thing, Dad.

320
00:25:48,753 --> 00:25:50,852
They don't feel that's anything
to be ashamed of.

321
00:25:53,157 --> 00:25:54,348
Well, it is.

322
00:25:57,361 --> 00:25:58,448
Yeah, you're right.

323
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,420
Don't placate me like
I'm your mother, boy.

324
00:26:05,169 --> 00:26:07,036
Forgive me sir, for speaking so bluntly,

325
00:26:07,605 --> 00:26:10,131
but those fags make me want
to puke my fucking guts out.

326
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,594
Well, me too son.

327
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,506
Yeah. Me too.

328
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm serious.

329
00:26:30,017 --> 00:26:32,595
He just pulled down his pants
and yanked it out.

330
00:26:32,763 --> 00:26:34,891
You know, like say hello to Mr. Happy.

331
00:26:35,092 --> 00:26:36,360
Gross!

332
00:26:36,834 --> 00:26:38,005
It wasn't gross.

333
00:26:38,506 --> 00:26:39,628
It was kind of cool.

334
00:26:39,629 --> 00:26:41,269
So did you do it with him?

335
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:42,746
Of course I did.

336
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:45,473
He's a really well-known photographer.

337
00:26:45,743 --> 00:26:48,141
He shoots for Elle on like a regular basis.

338
00:26:48,612 --> 00:26:51,253
It would've been majorly
stupid of me to turn him down.

339
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,304
You are a total prostitute.

340
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:55,012
Hey,

341
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,381
that's how things really are.

342
00:26:57,655 --> 00:27:01,089
You just don't know because you're
this pampered little suburban chick.

343
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:05,154
So are you. You've only been
in Seventeen once, and you looked fat.

344
00:27:05,229 --> 00:27:08,192
So stop acting like you're
goddamn Christy Turlington!

345
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:12,369
Cunt!

346
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:18,130
I am so sick of people taking
their insecurities out on me.

347
00:27:20,544 --> 00:27:21,504
Oh, my God.

348
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,681
That's the pervert who filmed me last night.

349
00:27:23,882 --> 00:27:24,608
Him?

350
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:27,275
Jane no way. He's a total lunatic.

351
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:28,985
Do you know him?
Yeah.

352
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:31,748
We were on the same lunch shift
when I was in ninth grade,

353
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:35,083
and he would always save
the most random, weird things.

354
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,601
And then one day,

355
00:27:36,902 --> 00:27:39,062
he was just like, gone.

356
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:40,481
And then,

357
00:27:41,182 --> 00:27:43,355
Connie Cardullo told me that his parents

358
00:27:43,356 --> 00:27:45,566
had to put him in a mental institution.

359
00:27:45,636 --> 00:27:47,797
Why?
What did he do?

360
00:27:48,672 --> 00:27:49,773
What do you mean?

361
00:27:50,841 --> 00:27:53,937
Well, they can't put you away
just for saying weird things.

362
00:27:57,381 --> 00:28:00,132
You total slut.

363
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,212
You've got a crush on him.
What?

364
00:28:03,286 --> 00:28:04,813
Please! You are defending him.

365
00:28:04,814 --> 00:28:07,767
You love him. You want to have,
like 10,000 of his babies.

366
00:28:07,768 --> 00:28:08,755
Shut up.

367
00:28:08,826 --> 00:28:09,551
Hi.

368
00:28:10,852 --> 00:28:13,026
My name's Ricky.
I just moved next door to you.

369
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:14,722
I know.

370
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:19,478
I kind of remember this creepy incident
where you were filming me last night?

371
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,478
I didn't mean to scare you.
I just think you're interesting.

372
00:28:22,804 --> 00:28:23,595
Thanks.

373
00:28:23,948 --> 00:28:27,878
But I really don't need to have some
psycho obsessing about me right now.

374
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:30,633
I'm not obsessing.

375
00:28:31,434 --> 00:28:32,513
Just curious.

376
00:28:48,473 --> 00:28:49,741
What a freak.

377
00:28:50,509 --> 00:28:52,742
And why does he dress
like a Bible salesman?

378
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:57,040
He's, like, so confident.

379
00:28:57,815 --> 00:28:59,075
That can't be real.

380
00:29:01,152 --> 00:29:02,212
I don't believe him.

381
00:29:02,888 --> 00:29:06,249
I mean, he didn't even like,
look at me, once.

382
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,312
<i>How'd you get in the Army?</i>

383
00:29:13,438 --> 00:29:16,218
<i>Sergeant, I got three reasons
for being in the Army.</i>

384
00:29:16,468 --> 00:29:18,831
<i>First, I'm patriotic.
Second, I love my country.</i>

385
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,320
<i>And third, they nailed me.</i>

386
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:35,719
Hey.

387
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,594
<i>What's going on here?</i>

388
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,946
<i>Bend all the way down.
Here comes the Bull of the Woods.</i>

389
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:47,325
I'm sorry. What?

390
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:51,701
Mom, nobody said anything.

391
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,804
I'm sorry.

392
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,672
Everyone here is with their spouse
or significant other.

393
00:30:03,748 --> 00:30:05,440
How would it look if I showed up
with no one?

394
00:30:05,441 --> 00:30:06,608
You always end up ignoring me.

395
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:07,834
Now, listen to me.

396
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,177
This is an important business function.

397
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:13,505
As you know, my business
is selling an image,

398
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:16,026
and part of my job is to live that image.

399
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:17,993
Alright, honey do me a favor?
Excuse me. Sorry.

400
00:30:17,994 --> 00:30:20,646
Just say whatever you want to say
and spare me the propaganda.

401
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:21,334
Alright.

402
00:30:21,735 --> 00:30:22,804
Hi, Shirley!

403
00:30:25,081 --> 00:30:26,470
Listen, just do me a favor.

404
00:30:26,771 --> 00:30:27,933
Act happy tonight.

405
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,394
I am happy, honey.

406
00:30:29,395 --> 00:30:30,553
No, you're not.

407
00:30:31,521 --> 00:30:32,613
That's Buddy!

408
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,027
Buddy.

409
00:30:34,528 --> 00:30:35,357
Buddy!

410
00:30:35,425 --> 00:30:36,731
Hi.
Hi!

411
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:39,028
Good to see you again.

412
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:41,347
It's so good to see you too, Catherine.

413
00:30:42,015 --> 00:30:43,073
Carolyn.

414
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,413
Carolyn, of course.

415
00:30:44,914 --> 00:30:45,934
How are you?

416
00:30:46,002 --> 00:30:47,094
Very well, thank you.

417
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:49,480
Hello, Christy.
Hello.

418
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,688
My husband, Lester.

419
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:53,609
It's a pleasure.

420
00:30:53,777 --> 00:30:56,345
We've met before, actually.
This thing last year.

421
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:58,502
I think Christmas at the Sheraton.

422
00:30:59,403 --> 00:31:00,403
Yeah.

423
00:31:01,284 --> 00:31:03,702
It's ok. I wouldn't remember me, either.

424
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,851
Honey, don't be weird!

425
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:13,554
Alright, honey. I won't be weird.
Ok.

426
00:31:13,922 --> 00:31:17,188
I'll be whatever you want me to be.

427
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:18,217
Well, ok...

428
00:31:29,604 --> 00:31:31,366
We have a very healthy relationship.

429
00:31:32,167 --> 00:31:33,256
I see.

430
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,288
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I need a drink.

431
00:31:46,496 --> 00:31:48,055
Put a little more in there, cowboy.

432
00:32:04,514 --> 00:32:05,514
Excuse me.

433
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,462
Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail?

434
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:09,727
The house with the red door?

435
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:11,353
Yeah.

436
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,832
I'm Ricky Fitts.
I just moved in the house next to you.

437
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,028
Hi, Ricky Fitts.
I'm Lester Burnham.

438
00:32:19,195 --> 00:32:21,597
Hi, Mr. Burnham.

439
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:32,916
Do you party?

440
00:32:34,461 --> 00:32:35,399
Excuse me?

441
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,279
Do you get high?

442
00:32:41,134 --> 00:32:44,988
You know, I probably wouldn't even
tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy but...

443
00:32:46,914 --> 00:32:49,049
I'm in complete awe of you.

444
00:32:50,518 --> 00:32:51,226
I mean,

445
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:56,998
your firm is hands down the Rolls Royce
of local real estate firms and...

446
00:32:57,566 --> 00:33:00,035
your personal sales record is...

447
00:33:02,155 --> 00:33:03,898
It's very intimidating.

448
00:33:05,075 --> 00:33:09,395
You know, I'd love to sit down
with you and just pick your brain.

449
00:33:09,663 --> 00:33:11,405
If you'd ever be willing.

450
00:33:14,167 --> 00:33:17,854
You know, I suppose, technically,
I'm the competition but...

451
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,329
I mean,

452
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:24,385
Hey I don't flatter myself that I'm
even in the same league as you.

453
00:33:24,552 --> 00:33:26,261
I don't.

454
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:28,322
I'd love to.

455
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:31,649
Really?

456
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,927
Absolutely.

457
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:36,555
Call my secretary.
Have her schedule a lunch.

458
00:33:38,858 --> 00:33:40,659
I'll do that. Thank you.

459
00:33:48,284 --> 00:33:49,744
Did you see that movie where the...

460
00:33:50,045 --> 00:33:52,471
body is walking around carrying
its own head,

461
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,707
and then the head goes down on that babe?

462
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:57,268
Re-Animator.

463
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:02,891
Look, I'm not paying you to do,

464
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:05,034
whatever it is you're doing out here.

465
00:34:06,136 --> 00:34:08,037
Fine. So don't pay me.

466
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:10,691
Excuse me?

467
00:34:10,692 --> 00:34:11,732
I quit.

468
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,498
So you don't have to pay me.

469
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,352
Now leave me alone.

470
00:34:17,897 --> 00:34:18,931
Asshole.

471
00:34:24,529 --> 00:34:26,497
I think you just became
my personal hero.

472
00:34:27,824 --> 00:34:30,876
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job like that?

473
00:34:32,996 --> 00:34:34,443
Well, I guess when you're all of...

474
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:35,764
what, 16...

475
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,141
Eighteen.

476
00:34:38,501 --> 00:34:40,369
I just do these gigs as a cover.

477
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:43,364
I have other sources of income.

478
00:34:44,716 --> 00:34:46,216
But my dad interferes less in my life

479
00:34:46,384 --> 00:34:49,470
when I pretend to be an upstanding
young citizen with a respectable job.

480
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:51,189
Lester?

481
00:34:55,018 --> 00:34:56,085
What are you doing?

482
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:58,087
Honey, this...

483
00:34:58,488 --> 00:34:59,563
Ricky Fitts.

484
00:35:01,024 --> 00:35:02,950
This is Ricky Fitts.

485
00:35:05,612 --> 00:35:08,597
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.

486
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:10,374
I go to school with your daughter.

487
00:35:12,243 --> 00:35:13,269
With Jane?

488
00:35:14,037 --> 00:35:15,315
Yeah.
Really?

489
00:35:15,316 --> 00:35:16,038
Jane.

490
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,958
Hi. I'm ready to go.

491
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:21,510
I'll meet you out front.

492
00:35:26,883 --> 00:35:28,551
I'm in trouble!

493
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:32,999
Nice meeting you, Ricky Fitts.

494
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,223
Thanks for the... thing.

495
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:36,158
Anytime. Lester!

496
00:35:37,685 --> 00:35:39,820
If you want any more,
you know where I live.

497
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:56,830
Shit. They're home.

498
00:35:57,231 --> 00:35:58,480
Quick, let's go up to my room.

499
00:35:58,748 --> 00:36:00,399
I should say hi to your dad.

500
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:02,952
I don't want to be rude.

501
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:17,307
Nice suit.

502
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:21,520
You're looking good, Mr. Burnham.

503
00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:24,731
Last time I saw you,
you looked kind of wound up.

504
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:31,038
Is that root beer?

505
00:37:31,007 --> 00:37:32,883
I love root beer, don't you?

506
00:37:35,511 --> 00:37:37,471
Hey.
Hi, Mom.

507
00:37:37,639 --> 00:37:39,240
Hey.
You remember Angela?

508
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:41,467
Yes, of course.

509
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:44,311
I forgot to tell you, she's gonna
spend the night. Is that ok?

510
00:37:53,655 --> 00:37:54,880
Sorry about my dad.

511
00:37:55,448 --> 00:37:57,199
Don't be. I think it's funny.

512
00:37:58,326 --> 00:38:01,871
Yeah, to you, he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.

513
00:38:02,538 --> 00:38:04,287
But to me, he's just...

514
00:38:05,513 --> 00:38:07,234
too embarrassing to live.

515
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:10,841
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing.

516
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:12,247
What a phony.

517
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,466
But your dad's actually kind of cute.

518
00:38:14,634 --> 00:38:15,768
Shut up.

519
00:38:16,135 --> 00:38:19,338
He is. If he just worked out a little,
he'd be hot.

520
00:38:19,806 --> 00:38:20,868
Shut up!

521
00:38:21,194 --> 00:38:24,393
Oh come on, like you've never sneaked
a peek at him in his underwear?

522
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,353
I bet he's got a big dick.

523
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:28,764
You are so grossing me out right now!

524
00:38:29,232 --> 00:38:32,259
If he built up his chest and arms,
I would totally fuck him!

525
00:38:32,527 --> 00:38:36,822
I would! I would suck
on your dad's big, fat dick

526
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,592
and then I'd fuck him until
his eyes rolled back in his head!

527
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,340
Jane!

528
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:43,044
What's that noise?

529
00:38:46,416 --> 00:38:47,908
I swear I heard something.

530
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:49,109
Yeah.

531
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:51,637
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.

532
00:38:52,005 --> 00:38:53,500
No, I'm serious.

533
00:38:54,826 --> 00:38:55,699
See?

534
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,643
Oh, my God.

535
00:38:59,944 --> 00:39:00,944
Jane.
What is it?

536
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,380
It's that psycho next door.

537
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,171
Jane, what if he worships you?

538
00:39:09,731 --> 00:39:10,745
What if he's got like,

539
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:14,460
a shrine with pictures of you surrounded
by dead people's heads and stuff?

540
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:17,446
Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

541
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,982
Really?

542
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:54,243
Welcome to America's
Weirdest Home Videos.

543
00:41:21,237 --> 00:41:22,028
Ricky?

544
00:41:23,029 --> 00:41:24,030
Coming, Dad.

545
00:41:25,508 --> 00:41:28,019
You know I don't like locked
doors in my house, boy.

546
00:41:34,417 --> 00:41:36,535
I'm sorry.
I must've locked it by accident.

547
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:39,988
So, what's up?

548
00:41:44,476 --> 00:41:46,027
I need a urine sample.

549
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:50,315
It's been six months already.

550
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:54,069
Can I give it to you in the morning?
I just took a whiz.

551
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:56,671
Yeah, I suppose.

552
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,111
You know...

553
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:11,688
Well...

554
00:42:12,814 --> 00:42:14,105
Good night, Son.

555
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:22,624
<i>I've been waiting for you.</i>

556
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,572
<i>You've been working out, haven't you?</i>

557
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,749
<i>I could tell.</i>

558
00:43:50,303 --> 00:43:52,387
<i>I was hoping you'd give me a bath.</i>

559
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:55,515
<i>I'm very, very dirty.</i>

560
00:44:28,966 --> 00:44:30,084
What are you doing?

561
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:33,503
Nothing.

562
00:44:34,638 --> 00:44:36,131
You were masturbating.

563
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:38,425
I was not.
Yes, you were.

564
00:44:40,394 --> 00:44:42,904
Alright, so shoot me!
I was whacking off.

565
00:44:44,065 --> 00:44:46,382
That's right, I was choking the bishop.

566
00:44:46,383 --> 00:44:48,303
Chafing the carrot you know,

567
00:44:48,304 --> 00:44:50,012
saying hi to my monster.

568
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:52,131
That's disgusting!

569
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:56,443
Oh, excuse me, but some of us still
have blood pumping through our veins!

570
00:44:56,911 --> 00:44:58,620
So do I!
Really?

571
00:44:58,788 --> 00:45:01,198
I'm the only one who seems
to be doing anything about it!

572
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:06,269
Lester, I refuse to live like this.

573
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,113
This is not a marriage!

574
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:11,366
This hasn't been a marriage, for years.

575
00:45:11,634 --> 00:45:13,877
But you were happy as long as
I kept my mouth shut.

576
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,412
Well, guess what?
I've changed.

577
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,065
And the new me, whacks off
when he feels horny,

578
00:45:19,308 --> 00:45:21,708
because you're obviously not gonna
help me out in that department.

579
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:25,279
I see. You think you're the only
one who's sexually frustrated.

580
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:28,166
I'm not?
Well, then come on, baby, I'm ready!

581
00:45:28,234 --> 00:45:30,193
Don't you mess with me, mister.

582
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:33,688
I will divorce you so fast
it'll make your head spin!

583
00:45:33,756 --> 00:45:35,640
On what grounds?

584
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:38,493
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.

585
00:45:38,661 --> 00:45:40,703
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.

586
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:43,665
I don't even try to touch you
since you made it abundantly clear...

587
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:46,000
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be!

588
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:51,339
But, I did support you
when you got your license.

589
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:54,809
And some people might think that
entitles me to half of what's yours.

590
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,583
So, turn out the light
when you come back to bed, ok?

591
00:46:14,321 --> 00:46:16,030
<font color="#00ffff"><i>It's a great thing when you realize</i></font>

592
00:46:16,031 --> 00:46:18,933
<font color="#00ffff"><i>you still have the ability
to surprise yourself.</i></font>

593
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:24,289
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Makes you wonder what else you can
do that you've forgotten about.</i></font>

594
00:46:24,790 --> 00:46:25,690
Hey, guys!

595
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:28,253
Lester, I didn't know you ran.

596
00:46:28,554 --> 00:46:29,477
I just started.

597
00:46:29,545 --> 00:46:30,712
Good for you.

598
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,641
I figured you might be able to give me
some pointers. I need to shape up. Fast.

599
00:46:35,009 --> 00:46:36,877
Are you looking to just lose weight
or do you...

600
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:40,063
want to have increased
strength and flexibility as well?

601
00:46:42,224 --> 00:46:43,758
I want to look good naked.

602
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,792
What is this?

603
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,512
Fucking gay pride parade?

604
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,115
Hey, Ricky.

605
00:47:09,668 --> 00:47:13,155
My entire life is passing before my eyes
and those two have barely broken a sweat.

606
00:47:14,423 --> 00:47:15,267
Sorry, hi.

607
00:47:15,568 --> 00:47:17,575
Lester Burnham. I live next door.
We haven't met.

608
00:47:17,843 --> 00:47:19,777
Colonel Frank Fitts, US Marine Corps.

609
00:47:21,545 --> 00:47:22,263
Well...

610
00:47:23,224 --> 00:47:24,641
Welcome to the neighborhood, sir.

611
00:47:29,188 --> 00:47:30,188
Ricky...

612
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:33,636
I was thinking about the...

613
00:47:34,337 --> 00:47:34,858
I was go...

614
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:36,892
the movie we talked about. Re-Animator.

615
00:47:36,893 --> 00:47:37,695
Yeah.

616
00:47:37,863 --> 00:47:39,007
You want to borrow it?

617
00:47:39,008 --> 00:47:40,156
Ok, it's up in my room.

618
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:41,541
Ok.
Come on.

619
00:47:52,878 --> 00:47:54,629
Can you hold this for a sec?
Sure.

620
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,957
I don't think my dad would come in
while someone else is here,

621
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,093
but you never know.
What is this?

622
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:01,761
Urine.

623
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:06,049
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm clean.

624
00:48:07,017 --> 00:48:09,203
Are you kidding?
You just smoked with me last night.

625
00:48:10,271 --> 00:48:11,313
It's nof mine.

626
00:48:12,481 --> 00:48:14,825
One of my clients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.

627
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:17,486
I cut her a deal,

628
00:48:17,887 --> 00:48:19,337
she keeps me in clean piss.

629
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,783
You like Pink Floyd?

630
00:48:25,452 --> 00:48:26,678
I like a lot of music.

631
00:48:28,998 --> 00:48:32,000
Man, I haven't listened
to this album in years.

632
00:48:33,502 --> 00:48:35,169
How much do you want?

633
00:48:36,205 --> 00:48:37,952
I don't know. It's been a while.

634
00:48:38,453 --> 00:48:40,141
How much is an ounce?

635
00:48:43,804 --> 00:48:46,756
This is totally decent, and it's 300.

636
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:52,453
This shit, is top of the line.

637
00:48:52,521 --> 00:48:55,857
It's called G-13. It's genetically
engineered by the US government.

638
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:58,827
It's extremely potent,
but a completely mellow high.

639
00:48:59,153 --> 00:49:00,227
No paranoia.

640
00:49:01,697 --> 00:49:03,806
Is that what we smoked last night?

641
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:06,259
This is all I ever smoke.

642
00:49:10,623 --> 00:49:11,507
How much?

643
00:49:12,308 --> 00:49:13,508
Two grand.

644
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:15,310
Jesus!

645
00:49:16,378 --> 00:49:18,739
Things have changed since 1973.

646
00:49:19,506 --> 00:49:21,783
You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.

647
00:49:22,051 --> 00:49:23,051
Thanks.

648
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:25,470
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.

649
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,780
Beep me any time, day or night.

650
00:49:29,808 --> 00:49:31,225
And I only accept cash.

651
00:49:32,227 --> 00:49:34,437
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.

652
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,068
When I was your age, I flipped burgers
all summer just to buy an 8-track.

653
00:49:40,235 --> 00:49:41,736
That sucks.

654
00:49:42,004 --> 00:49:44,022
No. Actually, it was great.

655
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,901
All I did was party and get laid.

656
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:52,322
I had my whole life ahead of me.

657
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:57,852
My dad thinks I pay for all this
with catering jobs.

658
00:49:59,989 --> 00:50:02,082
Never underestimate the power of denial.

659
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,710
What the hell do you think you're doing?

660
00:50:41,296 --> 00:50:42,457
Mom's mad.

661
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,065
Bench presses.

662
00:50:45,092 --> 00:50:48,428
I'm going to whale on my pecs,
and then I'm going to do my back.

663
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:53,241
I see you're smoking pot now.
I'm so glad.

664
00:50:53,809 --> 00:50:55,977
I think using illegal psychotropic substances

665
00:50:56,145 --> 00:50:58,771
is a very positive example
to set for our daughter.

666
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:02,567
You're one to talk, you bloodless,
money-grubbing freak.

667
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:08,448
Lester, you have such hostility in you!

668
00:51:08,615 --> 00:51:10,359
Do you mind?
I'm trying to work out here.

669
00:51:11,326 --> 00:51:12,785
Unless you want to spot me.

670
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:18,166
Lester, you will not get away with this!
You can be sure of that!

671
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:22,754
That's... what...

672
00:51:23,422 --> 00:51:24,488
you...

673
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:25,598
think.

674
00:51:26,133 --> 00:51:32,430
My job consists of basically masking
my contempt for the assholes in charge...

675
00:51:33,098 --> 00:51:35,349
and at least once a day,

676
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:38,520
retiring to the men's room so
I can jerk off...

677
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:44,109
while I fantasize about a life that
doesn't so closely resemble hell.

678
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:48,988
Well, you obviously have
no interest in saving yourself.

679
00:51:49,156 --> 00:51:53,409
Brad, for 14 years I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.

680
00:51:53,577 --> 00:51:56,396
The only way I could save myself
now is if I start firebombing.

681
00:51:57,164 --> 00:51:58,142
Whatever,

682
00:51:58,643 --> 00:52:00,474
management wants you gone
by the end of the day.

683
00:52:00,542 --> 00:52:04,045
What sort of severance package is
management prepared to offer me,

684
00:52:04,213 --> 00:52:07,173
considering the information I have
about our editorial director,

685
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:09,200
buying pussy with company money?

686
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:11,219
Which I think would interest the IRS,

687
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,387
since it technically constitutes fraud.

688
00:52:13,555 --> 00:52:16,808
And I'm sure that some of our advertisers
and rival publications,

689
00:52:16,975 --> 00:52:18,727
might like to know about it as well.

690
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:19,724
Not to mention...

691
00:52:20,025 --> 00:52:21,237
Craig's wife.

692
00:52:23,148 --> 00:52:24,118
What do you want?

693
00:52:25,219 --> 00:52:27,418
One year's salary with benefits.

694
00:52:27,486 --> 00:52:29,037
That's not going to happen.

695
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:34,050
Well, what do you say I throw in a little
sexual harassment charge to boot?

696
00:52:37,037 --> 00:52:38,087
Against who?

697
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:39,847
Against you.

698
00:52:40,582 --> 00:52:43,434
Can you prove that you
didn't offer to save my job,

699
00:52:43,502 --> 00:52:45,620
if I let you blow me?

700
00:52:50,968 --> 00:52:52,175
Man.

701
00:52:52,576 --> 00:52:54,628
You are one twisted fuck.

702
00:52:55,848 --> 00:52:56,865
Nope.

703
00:52:57,432 --> 00:53:00,552
I'm just an ordinary guy
with nothing to lose.

704
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:07,750
Yeah!

705
00:53:14,366 --> 00:53:15,546
Carolyn.

706
00:53:16,147 --> 00:53:17,118
Buddy.

707
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,053
I am so sorry to have kept you waiting.

708
00:53:21,874 --> 00:53:23,624
Christy left for New York this morning.

709
00:53:23,792 --> 00:53:27,011
Let's just say things were
a little hectic around the house.

710
00:53:27,379 --> 00:53:29,188
What's she doing in New York?

711
00:53:29,256 --> 00:53:30,552
She's moving there.

712
00:53:30,953 --> 00:53:33,125
Yes. We are splitting up.

713
00:53:33,886 --> 00:53:35,823
Buddy, I'm so sorry.

714
00:53:35,824 --> 00:53:37,046
Yes.

715
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:38,715
According to her I'm...

716
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:41,434
too focused on my career.

717
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:45,581
As if being driven to succeed is some sort of a...

718
00:53:45,882 --> 00:53:47,265
character flaw.

719
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:52,720
Well she certainly did take advantage
of the lifestyle my success afforded her.

720
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:58,210
Oh, it's for the best.

721
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:04,498
When I saw you two at the party the
other night, you seemed perfectly happy.

722
00:54:04,666 --> 00:54:06,117
Call me crazy...

723
00:54:07,502 --> 00:54:11,289
but it is my philosophy
that in order to be successful,

724
00:54:12,257 --> 00:54:16,027
one must project an image
of success at all times.

725
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:37,582
What are you doing?

726
00:54:39,701 --> 00:54:41,069
I was filming this dead bird.

727
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:42,536
Why?

728
00:54:43,121 --> 00:54:44,272
Because it's beautiful.

729
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:50,603
I think maybe you forgot your
medication today, mental-boy.

730
00:54:53,465 --> 00:54:54,515
Hi, Jane.

731
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,627
Look, I want you to stop filming me.

732
00:55:00,222 --> 00:55:01,222
Ok.

733
00:55:01,890 --> 00:55:04,350
Well, whatever. This is boring.

734
00:55:04,518 --> 00:55:05,518
Let's go.

735
00:55:07,712 --> 00:55:08,858
Do you need a ride?

736
00:55:09,159 --> 00:55:10,548
Are you crazy?

737
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:13,885
I don't want to end up hacked to
pieces in a dumpster somewhere.

738
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:15,564
It's ok. I'll walk.

739
00:55:16,265 --> 00:55:17,265
But thanks.

740
00:55:17,698 --> 00:55:19,092
Yes, see? He doesn't want to go anyway.

741
00:55:19,093 --> 00:55:20,149
Come on. Let's go.

742
00:55:21,451 --> 00:55:22,452
Come on, Jane.

743
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,937
I think I'm gonna walk, too.

744
00:55:26,373 --> 00:55:27,331
What?

745
00:55:28,032 --> 00:55:30,693
Jane, that's like almost a mile!

746
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:49,311
God! I love it!

747
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:52,849
You like getting nailed by the king?
Yes, I love it!

748
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:54,885
Fuck me, Your Majesty!

749
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:57,486
Who's the king?
You are!

750
00:55:57,654 --> 00:55:59,071
Who's the king?

00:56:15,505 --> 00:56:17,331

What?

763
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,554
<i>Would you like to try

764
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:51,032

765
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,975
No, but thank you.

766
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:57,338
I'd like the Big Barn Burger,
Smiley Fries and an orange soda.

767
00:56:57,506 --> 00:56:59,390
<i>Please drive up to the window.
Thank you.</i>

768
00:57:01,843 --> 00:57:04,512
Smile, you're at Mr. Smiley's.
That'll be $4.98, please.

769
00:57:07,974 --> 00:57:09,226
Would you like some Smiley Sauce?

770
00:57:09,227 --> 00:57:10,309
No, no, no.

771
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,870
Actually, I'd like to fill out an application.

772
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:15,372
There's no jobs for manager.
It's just for counter.

773
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:16,441
Good.

774
00:57:17,109 --> 00:57:20,678
I'm looking for the least possible
amount of responsibility.

775
00:57:24,741 --> 00:57:26,467
I don't think you'd fit in here.

776
00:57:26,535 --> 00:57:29,245
I have fast-food experience.

777
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:31,856
Yeah, like 20 years ago!

778
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:36,210
I'm sure there have been amazing
technological advances in the industry,

779
00:57:36,211 --> 00:57:38,512
but surely you must have
some sort of training program.

780
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,590
It seems unfair to presume
I won't be able to learn.

781
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,139
That was exactly what I needed.

782
00:57:52,144 --> 00:57:54,303
The royal treatment, so to speak.

783
00:57:57,607 --> 00:57:59,058
I was so stressed out.

784
00:58:07,534 --> 00:58:09,405
Know what I do when I feel like that?

785
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:10,244
What?

786
00:58:12,247 --> 00:58:13,990
I fire a gun.

787
00:58:14,457 --> 00:58:15,624
Really?

788
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:18,222
Yeah, I go to this little firing range downtown and I...

789
00:58:18,923 --> 00:58:20,746
just pop off a few rounds.

790
00:58:22,507 --> 00:58:24,425
I've never fired a gun before.

791
00:58:24,593 --> 00:58:25,960
Well, you've got to try it.

792
00:58:26,428 --> 00:58:28,370
Nothing makes you feel more powerful.

793
00:58:31,433 --> 00:58:32,228
Well...

794
00:58:33,329 --> 00:58:34,944
almost nothing.

795
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:42,210
So, do you like your new house?

796
00:58:42,677 --> 00:58:43,886
I like it.

797
00:58:44,154 --> 00:58:47,364
The people who used to live there fed
stray cats, so they were always around,

798
00:58:47,532 --> 00:58:49,651
and it drove my mother nuts.

799
00:58:50,619 --> 00:58:52,345
And then she cut down their tree.

800
00:58:54,456 --> 00:58:55,598
Is that a funeral?

801
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:57,399
Yeah.

802
00:58:58,335 --> 00:58:59,936
Have you ever known
anybody who died?

803
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:01,937
No.

804
00:59:02,238 --> 00:59:03,063
Have you?

805
00:59:04,131 --> 00:59:05,131
No.

806
00:59:06,134 --> 00:59:08,644
But I did see this homeless woman
who froze to death once.

807
00:59:09,012 --> 00:59:10,524
Just lying there on the sidewalk.

808
00:59:11,325 --> 00:59:12,706
She looked really sad.

809
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:28,823
I got that homeless woman
on videotape.

810
00:59:29,991 --> 00:59:31,334
Why would you film that?

811
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:33,453
Because it was amazing.

812
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,580
What's amazing about it?

813
00:59:36,248 --> 00:59:37,649
When you see something like that...

814
00:59:38,416 --> 00:59:39,974
it's like God is looking right at you,

815
00:59:40,275 --> 00:59:41,335
just for a second.

816
00:59:42,337 --> 00:59:44,264
And if you're careful,
you can look right back.

817
00:59:45,131 --> 00:59:46,157
And what do you see?

818
00:59:48,093 --> 00:59:49,177
Beauty.

819
01:00:05,944 --> 01:00:06,749
Mom?

820
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,329
I want you to meet somebody.

821
01:00:12,826 --> 01:00:13,704
Mom?

822
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:16,003
Yes.

823
01:00:17,998 --> 01:00:19,332
I want you to meet somebody.

824
01:00:19,733 --> 01:00:21,308
This is Jane.

825
01:00:22,419 --> 01:00:23,334
Hi.

826
01:00:23,335 --> 01:00:24,503
Oh, my.

827
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:27,064
I apologize for the way
things look around here.

828
01:00:38,143 --> 01:00:39,777
This is where my dad hides out.

829
01:00:40,895 --> 01:00:42,563
I take it he's got a thing for guns.

830
01:00:44,858 --> 01:00:46,325
You got to see this one thing.

831
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,871
My dad would kill me
if he knew I was in here.

832
01:00:52,365 --> 01:00:53,658
Did you steal his keys?

833
01:00:54,326 --> 01:00:57,077
No. One of my clients is a locksmith.

834
01:00:57,245 --> 01:00:59,830
He was short on cash one night,
so I let him pay me in trade.

835
01:01:14,554 --> 01:01:15,571
Turn it over.

836
01:01:20,018 --> 01:01:21,685
Oh, my God.

837
01:01:21,853 --> 01:01:24,213
It's like official state china
of the Third Reich.

838
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:27,984
There's a whole subculture of people
who collect this Nazi shit.

839
01:01:29,527 --> 01:01:31,237
But my dad just has this one thing.

840
01:01:44,417 --> 01:01:45,445
What's wrong?

841
01:01:45,846 --> 01:01:46,927
Nothing.

842
01:01:48,546 --> 01:01:50,011
No, you're scared of me.

843
01:01:50,912 --> 01:01:52,174
No, I'm not.

844
01:01:53,635 --> 01:01:55,828
You want to see the most beautiful
thing I've ever filmed?

845
01:02:21,121 --> 01:02:22,630
It was one of those days...

846
01:02:23,498 --> 01:02:25,333
where it's a minute away from snowing...

847
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,704
and there's this electricity in the air.

848
01:02:34,175 --> 01:02:35,717
You can almost hear it.

849
01:02:36,678 --> 01:02:37,778
Right?

850
01:02:42,517 --> 01:02:43,826
And this bag was just...

851
01:02:46,438 --> 01:02:48,305
dancing, with me.

852
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,377
Like a little kid,
begging me to play with it.

853
01:02:56,281 --> 01:02:57,765
For 15 minutes.

854
01:03:02,287 --> 01:03:04,346
That's the day I realized
that there was this...

855
01:03:06,541 --> 01:03:09,343
entire life behind things...

856
01:03:13,631 --> 01:03:14,881
and this incredibly,

857
01:03:15,282 --> 01:03:16,950
benevolent force...

858
01:03:17,635 --> 01:03:20,596
that wanted me to know that
there was no reason to be afraid...

859
01:03:23,475 --> 01:03:24,475
ever.

860
01:03:27,979 --> 01:03:29,997
Video is a poor excuse, I know.

861
01:03:33,359 --> 01:03:34,894
But it helps me remember.

862
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:40,900
I need to remember.

863
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:50,309
Sometimes there is so much...

864
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:53,165
beauty...

865
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:56,389
in the world.

866
01:03:59,052 --> 01:04:00,469
I feel like I can't take it.

867
01:04:05,767 --> 01:04:06,834
And my heart...

868
01:04:08,603 --> 01:04:09,423
is just going to...

869
01:04:11,124 --> 01:04:12,147
cave in.

870
01:04:59,988 --> 01:05:02,039
Oh, my God. What time is it?

871
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:13,141
Sorry I'm late.
No. No that's quite alright, dear.

872
01:05:14,085 --> 01:05:16,336
Your father and I were just
discussing his day at work.

873
01:05:16,504 --> 01:05:18,505
Why don't you tell our daughter
about it, honey?

874
01:05:18,673 --> 01:05:20,085
Janie, today I quit my job.

875
01:05:20,711 --> 01:05:22,618
Then I told my boss to go fuck himself,

876
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,679
and blackmailed him for almost $60,000.
Pass the asparagus.

877
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:29,199
Your father seems to think this kind
of behavior is something to be proud of.

878
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:32,244
And your mother seems to prefer I go
through life like a fucking prisoner

879
01:05:32,312 --> 01:05:34,271
while she keeps my dick
in a mason jar under the sink.

880
01:05:34,439 --> 01:05:36,898
How dare you speak to me
that way in front of her?

881
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,626
And I marvel that you can be
so contemptuous of me,

882
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:42,195
on the same day that you lose your job!

883
01:05:42,363 --> 01:05:45,115
I didn't lose it. It's not like
Whoops! Where'd my job go? I quit!

884
01:05:45,283 --> 01:05:47,018
Someone pass me the asparagus, please.

885
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,303
And I want to thank you for putting me
under the added pressure,

886
01:05:50,304 --> 01:05:52,126
of being the sole breadwinner now.

887
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:53,056
I already have a job.
Stop!

888
01:05:53,057 --> 01:05:55,642
No! Don't give a second thought
as to who's gonna pay the mortgage.

889
01:05:55,710 --> 01:05:57,294
We'll just leave it all up to Carolyn!

890
01:05:57,462 --> 01:05:59,379
You mean you're gonna take care
of everything now, Carolyn?

891
01:05:59,547 --> 01:06:00,797
Yes. I don't mind, I really don't.

892
01:06:00,965 --> 01:06:04,051
You mean, everything? You don't mind
having the sole responsibility?

893
01:06:04,218 --> 01:06:06,303
Your husband feels he can just quit his job,

894
01:06:06,304 --> 01:06:08,388
and you don't...
Will someone pass the fucking asparagus?

895
01:06:08,556 --> 01:06:10,557
Ok guys, I'm not gonna be a part of this.

896
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:11,524
Sit down!

897
01:06:31,913 --> 01:06:34,548
I am sick and tired of being
treated like I don't exist.

898
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,911
You two do whatever you want to do,

899
01:06:36,912 --> 01:06:39,220
whenever you want to do it,
and I don't complain.

900
01:06:39,221 --> 01:06:40,969
Now all I want...
You don't complain?

901
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:42,589
Please! Excuse me, excuse me!

902
01:06:42,757 --> 01:06:45,342
I must be psychotic!
If you don't complain, what is this?

903
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:48,028
Yeah, let's, let's, let's bring in the laugh meter

904
01:06:48,096 --> 01:06:50,681
and see how loud it gets on
that one! You don't...

905
01:07:00,775 --> 01:07:02,759
Don't interrupt me, honey.

906
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:18,134
And another thing.

907
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,461
From now on, we're going
to alternate our dinner music,

908
01:07:21,629 --> 01:07:24,031
because frankly,
and I don't think I'm alone here,

909
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:26,683
I am really tired of this Lawrence Welk shit.

910
01:07:36,352 --> 01:07:37,794
Go away!

911
01:07:38,062 --> 01:07:40,180
Honey, please let me in.

912
01:07:49,907 --> 01:07:54,745
Lokk, I, I wish that you hadn't witnessed
that awful scene tonight but in a way, I'm glad.

913
01:07:54,912 --> 01:07:57,497
Why? So I can see what freaks
you and Dad really are?

914
01:07:58,624 --> 01:07:59,625
Me?

915
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:04,271
Oh, God.

916
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,674
Christ, Mom.

917
01:08:08,634 --> 01:08:10,561
No, I'm glad because...

918
01:08:13,181 --> 01:08:17,042
Because you're old enough now to learn
the most important lesson in life.

919
01:08:18,686 --> 01:08:22,486
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

920
01:08:27,111 --> 01:08:29,911
You cannot count on anyone
except yourself.

921
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:33,942
You know, it's sad but true.

922
01:08:35,203 --> 01:08:37,370
And the sooner you learn it, the better.

923
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:41,500
Look, Mom, I really don't feel like
having a Kodak moment here, ok?

924
01:08:42,627 --> 01:08:44,436
You ungrateful little brat!

925
01:08:45,379 --> 01:08:47,147
Just look at everything you have!

926
01:08:47,715 --> 01:08:50,175
When I was your age, I lived in a duplex!

927
01:08:50,343 --> 01:08:52,219
We didn't even have our own house.

928
01:10:55,259 --> 01:10:56,727
You little bastard!

929
01:10:56,728 --> 01:10:59,346
No, I just, I just want...
How did you get in there?

930
01:11:00,014 --> 01:11:01,606
How? How?

931
01:11:03,893 --> 01:11:06,019
Come on, get up! Come on!

932
01:11:06,187 --> 01:11:07,279
Get up!

933
01:11:08,147 --> 01:11:10,023
Fight back, you little pussy!

934
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:11,858
No sir, I won't fight you!

935
01:11:12,126 --> 01:11:14,874
How? How did you get in there?

936
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:15,962
I picked the lock, sir.

937
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,761
What were you looking for?

938
01:11:17,762 --> 01:11:19,758
Money? Are you on dope again?

939
01:11:19,825 --> 01:11:22,594
No sir. I wanted to show
my girlfriend your Nazi plate.

940
01:11:24,330 --> 01:11:25,497
A girlfriend?

941
01:11:25,498 --> 01:11:27,124
Yes, sir. She lives next door.

942
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:42,339
Her name is Jane.

943
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:04,886
This is for your own good, boy.

944
01:12:08,207 --> 01:12:09,964
You have no respect,

945
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:11,595
for other people's things,

946
01:12:11,996 --> 01:12:14,354
and for authority.
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

947
01:12:14,922 --> 01:12:18,550
Ok, just go around doing
whatever you feel like!

948
01:12:19,218 --> 01:12:20,425
You can't!

949
01:12:20,726 --> 01:12:22,223
There are rules in life.

950
01:12:22,224 --> 01:12:23,379
Yes, sir.

951
01:12:26,434 --> 01:12:28,969
You need structure, yeah.

952
01:12:29,437 --> 01:12:31,688
You need discipline!
Discipline. Yes, sir.

953
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:34,441
Thank you for trying to teach me.
Don't give up on me, Dad.

954
01:12:40,448 --> 01:12:41,448
Ricky...

955
01:12:47,038 --> 01:12:49,664
You stay out of there!

956
01:13:38,422 --> 01:13:42,075
I gotta say Miss Burnham, when you first
ame here, I thought you would be hopeless.

957
01:13:42,343 --> 01:13:43,451
But you're a natural.

958
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,997
Well, all I know is,
I love shooting this gun!

Whose car is that out front?

975
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:07,927
Mine. 1970 Pontiac Firebird,

976
01:15:07,928 --> 01:15:10,130
the car I've always wanted,
and now I have it.

977
01:15:10,598 --> 01:15:11,758
I rule.

978
01:15:11,759 --> 01:15:13,057
Where's the Camry?

979
01:15:13,225 --> 01:15:14,368
I traded it in.

980
01:15:15,436 --> 01:15:17,345
Shouldn't you have consulted me first?

981
01:15:18,397 --> 01:15:19,772
Let me think.

982
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:21,983
No. You never drove it.

983
01:15:24,069 --> 01:15:25,384
Have you done something different?

984
01:15:25,585 --> 01:15:26,979
You look great.

985
01:15:32,119 --> 01:15:33,228
Where's Jane?

986
01:15:34,455 --> 01:15:35,789
Jane not home.

987
01:15:42,796 --> 01:15:43,947
We have...

988
01:15:47,468 --> 01:15:48,952
the whole house...

989
01:15:50,554 --> 01:15:51,939
to ourselves.

990
01:15:55,309 --> 01:15:56,701
Christ, Carolyn.

991
01:15:58,145 --> 01:15:59,812
When did you become so...

992
01:16:02,233 --> 01:16:03,425
joyless?

993
01:16:05,361 --> 01:16:06,462
Joyless?

994
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:09,597
I am not joyless.

995
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:12,992
There happens to be a lot about me

996
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,920
that you don't know, Mr. Smarty Man.

997
01:16:17,331 --> 01:16:20,166
There is plenty of joy in my life.

998
01:16:23,087 --> 01:16:24,963
Whatever happened to that girl...

999
01:16:28,592 --> 01:16:32,587
who used to fake seizures at
frat parties when she got bored?

1000
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:38,252
Who used to run up to the roof
of our first apartment building...

1001
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,988
to flash the traffic helicopters?

1002
01:16:43,816 --> 01:16:46,117
Have you totally forgotten about her?

1003
01:16:46,485 --> 01:16:48,703
Because I haven't.

1004
01:17:02,126 --> 01:17:04,169
Lester, you're gonna spill beer
on the couch.

1005
01:17:12,761 --> 01:17:14,445
So what? It's just a couch.

1006
01:17:16,724 --> 01:17:21,294
This is a $4,000 sofa
upholstered in Italian silk!

1007
01:17:21,562 --> 01:17:23,062
This is not just a couch!

1008
01:17:23,430 --> 01:17:26,399
It's just a couch!

1009
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:28,935
This isn't life!

1010
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:31,004
This is just stuff.

1011
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:34,210
And it's become more important
to you than living.

1012
01:17:34,211 --> 01:17:35,917
Honey, that's just nuts.

1013
01:17:45,586 --> 01:17:47,404
I'm only trying to help you!

1014
01:17:54,094 --> 01:17:55,137
Don't.

1015
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:57,338
Why?

1016
01:18:01,101 --> 01:18:02,743
It's weird watching myself.

1017
01:18:03,444 --> 01:18:04,938
I don't like how I look.

1018
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:10,827
Can't believe you don't know
how beautiful you are.

1019
01:18:11,695 --> 01:18:14,281
Look, I'm not gonna sit here for that shit.

1020
01:18:25,459 --> 01:18:26,710
How does it feel now?

1021
01:18:27,878 --> 01:18:28,737
Fine.

1022
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:30,463
You don't feel naked?

1023
01:18:32,549 --> 01:18:33,692
I am naked.

1024
01:18:34,759 --> 01:18:36,027
You know what I mean.

1025
01:18:46,063 --> 01:18:47,881
So tell me about being in the hospital.

1026
01:18:52,444 --> 01:18:55,455
When I was 15,
my dad caught me smoking dope.

1027
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:59,242
He totally freaked and decided
to send me to military school.

1028
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,139
I told you his thing about
structure and discipline, right?

1029
01:19:05,207 --> 01:19:06,211
Well of course...

1030
01:19:06,612 --> 01:19:07,934
I got kicked out.

1031
01:19:09,586 --> 01:19:11,254
Dad and I had this huge fight.

1032
01:19:11,922 --> 01:19:13,056
He hit me.

1033
01:19:14,824 --> 01:19:18,611
And the next day at school, some
kid made a crack about my haircut.

1034
01:19:20,472 --> 01:19:21,823
And I just snapped.

1035
01:19:26,311 --> 01:19:27,504
I wanted to kill him.

1036
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:31,841
I would've killed him...

1037
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:35,754
if they hadn't pulled me off.

1038
01:19:39,867 --> 01:19:40,967
That's when my dad...

1039
01:19:41,968 --> 01:19:43,127
put me in the hospital.

1040
01:19:43,495 --> 01:19:46,273
They drugged me up and
left me in there for two years.

1041
01:19:51,670 --> 01:19:53,263
You must really hate him.

1042
01:19:57,468 --> 01:19:58,710
He's not a bad man.

1043
01:19:59,678 --> 01:20:03,173
You'd better believe I'd hate my dad
if he did something like that to me.

1044
01:20:05,392 --> 01:20:07,527
Wait. I already do hate my dad.

1045
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:11,272
Why?

1046
01:20:14,568 --> 01:20:15,835
He's a total asshole.

1047
01:20:16,403 --> 01:20:18,324
He's got this crush on
my friend Angela and...

1048
01:20:19,025 --> 01:20:20,123
it's disgusting.

1049
01:20:20,491 --> 01:20:22,700
You'd rather he had the crush on you.

1050
01:20:24,244 --> 01:20:25,904
Gross. No.

1051
01:20:29,917 --> 01:20:33,052
But it'd be nice if I was anywhere
near as important to him as she is.

1052
01:20:37,549 --> 01:20:39,481
I know you think my dad's harmless,

1053
01:20:39,782 --> 01:20:40,968
but you're wrong.

1054
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:45,298
He's doing massive
psychological damage to me.

1055
01:20:46,767 --> 01:20:47,842
How?

1056
01:20:48,310 --> 01:20:51,187
Well now, I too need structure.

1057
01:20:51,855 --> 01:20:53,414
A little fucking discipline.

1058
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:06,536
I'm serious, though.

1059
01:21:08,247 --> 01:21:09,914
How could he not be damaging me?

1060
01:21:13,126 --> 01:21:14,995
I need a father who's a role model.

1061
01:21:15,963 --> 01:21:18,297
Not some horny geek-boy
who's gonna spray his shorts

1062
01:21:18,465 --> 01:21:20,633
whenever I bring a girlfriend
home from school.

1063
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:24,637
What a lame-o.

1064
01:21:28,267 --> 01:21:31,169
Someone really should just
put him out of his misery.

1065
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:36,216
Want me to kill him for you?

1066
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:48,186
Yeah. Would you?

1067
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,356
It'll cost you.

1068
01:21:52,124 --> 01:21:54,500
I've been babysitting since I was about ten.

1069
01:21:54,668 --> 01:21:57,461
I've got almost $3,000.

1070
01:22:00,841 --> 01:22:02,675
Of course, I was saving it up for a boob job.

1071
01:22:04,595 --> 01:22:05,637
But...

1072
01:22:20,027 --> 01:22:22,528
You know, that's not
a very nice thing to do.

1073
01:22:25,866 --> 01:22:27,625
Hiring someone to kill your dad.

1074
01:22:31,121 --> 01:22:33,573
I guess I'm not a very nice girl then am I?

1075
01:22:58,398 --> 01:23:00,133
You know I'm not serious, right?

1076
01:23:01,902 --> 01:23:03,094
Of course.

1077
01:23:18,669 --> 01:23:20,703
You know how lucky we are
to have found each other?

1078
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:29,136
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Remember those posters that said:</i></font>

1079
01:23:29,604 --> 01:23:32,456
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Today is the first day
of the rest of your life?</i></font>

1080
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:37,378
<font color="#00ffff"><i>Well, that's true of every day except one:</i></font>

1081
01:23:38,772 --> 01:23:39,898
<font color="#00ffff"><i>The day you die.</i></font>

1082
01:24:19,896 --> 01:24:21,505
Jane, hurry up.

1083
01:24:21,773 --> 01:24:23,733
I've got a very important appointment.

1084
01:24:24,401 --> 01:24:27,027
Mom, is it ok if Angela sleeps over tonight?

1085
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,221
Well, of course.
She's always welcome.

1086
01:24:29,489 --> 01:24:32,484
I thought you two had a fight. I haven't
seen her around here in a while.

1087
01:24:40,792 --> 01:24:41,734
What?

1088
01:24:42,260 --> 01:24:44,905
I've been too embarrassed
to bring her over.

1089
01:24:45,973 --> 01:24:47,433
Because of you,

1090
01:24:47,434 --> 01:24:49,008
and that way you behave.

1091
01:24:49,009 --> 01:24:51,177
What are you talking about?
I've barely even spoken to her.

1092
01:24:51,178 --> 01:24:53,698
Dad!
You stare at her all the time!

1093
01:24:54,099 --> 01:24:55,197
Like you're drunk!

1094
01:24:55,265 --> 01:24:57,283
It's disgusting!
Watch yourself Jane,

1095
01:24:57,350 --> 01:24:59,761
or you're gonna turn into a real bitch,
just like your mother!

1096
01:25:05,192 --> 01:25:06,192
Fuck.

1097
01:25:14,367 --> 01:25:15,451
You ready to go?

1098
01:25:17,621 --> 01:25:18,855
I don't need a ride.

1099
01:25:18,856 --> 01:25:20,756
I'm going in with Jane and her mom.

1100
01:25:29,649 --> 01:25:30,649
Morning.

1101
01:25:31,802 --> 01:25:33,647
Hey, Ricky. How's it going?

1102
01:25:34,148 --> 01:25:35,529
Pretty decent, Mr. Burnham.

1103
01:25:35,597 --> 01:25:36,814
Hey, hey.

1104
01:26:56,469 --> 01:26:59,221
I need that Super Smiley
with cheese ASAP please!

1105
01:26:59,389 --> 01:27:01,640
You need more than that,
my little hombre.

1106
01:27:01,808 --> 01:27:05,102
<i>Oh yeah. What's good here?
Nothing!</i>

1107
01:27:05,270 --> 01:27:08,355
<i>Oh then I guess we'll
just have to be bad, won't we?</i>

1108
01:27:09,566 --> 01:27:11,817
<i>I'll have a Double Smiley sandwich,</i>

1109
01:27:11,985 --> 01:27:14,278
<i>curly fries and a vanilla shake.
Make that two!</i>

1110
01:27:14,446 --> 01:27:17,364
<i>That'll be $7.98. Please drive
up to the window. Thank you.</i>

1111
01:27:18,491 --> 01:27:22,828
I think we deserve a little junk food
after the workout we had this morning.

1112
01:27:24,623 --> 01:27:27,166
Did you know that?
Thank you. I'm flattered.

1113
01:27:28,668 --> 01:27:30,961
Smile! You're at Mister Smiley's!

1114
01:27:33,465 --> 01:27:36,091
Would you like to try our new beef
and cheese pot pie on a stick?

1115
01:27:36,092 --> 01:27:38,302
Just $1.99 for a limited time only?

1116
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:40,846
We were just at a seminar.

1117
01:27:41,014 --> 01:27:43,349
Buddy, this is my...
Her husband.

1118
01:27:43,516 --> 01:27:45,167
We've met before,

1119
01:27:45,335 --> 01:27:48,896
but something tells me you're
going to remember me this time.

1120
01:27:51,399 --> 01:27:53,692
You are so busted.

1121
01:27:53,693 --> 01:27:55,753
You know this really doesn't concern you!

1122
01:27:55,820 --> 01:28:00,149
Actually, Janine is senior drive-thru
manager, so you kind of are on her turf.

1123
01:28:04,871 --> 01:28:07,206
So, this makes sense.

1124
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,933
Oh, Lester...
Honey, it's ok.

1125
01:28:10,001 --> 01:28:11,561
I want you to be happy.

1126
01:28:12,128 --> 01:28:13,857
Would you like Smiley sauce with that?

1127
01:28:13,858 --> 01:28:15,172
Lester, just stop it!

1128
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,916
No, no. You...

1129
01:28:18,051 --> 01:28:20,211
don't get to tell me what to do...

1130
01:28:21,179 --> 01:28:23,263
ever again.

1131
01:28:37,529 --> 01:28:38,696
I'm sorry.

1132
01:28:41,074 --> 01:28:42,883
I guess we should cool it for a while.

1133
01:28:46,204 --> 01:28:48,898
I'm facing a potentially
very expensive divorce.

1134
01:28:49,165 --> 01:28:51,917
No. No. I understand completely.

1135
01:28:54,838 --> 01:28:58,749
In order to be successful one must
project an image of success at all times.

1136
01:29:25,952 --> 01:29:27,711
Stop it. Stop it.

1137
01:30:09,329 --> 01:30:10,329
Shit.

1138
01:30:17,337 --> 01:30:19,121
I have to run next door.

1139
01:30:19,589 --> 01:30:22,474
Jane left her geometry book in my bag.
She needs it to do her homework.

1140
01:30:33,269 --> 01:30:36,606
So you and psycho-boy are fucking
on a regular basis now, right?

1141
01:30:37,774 --> 01:30:38,598
No.

1142
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,326
Come on, you can tell me.

1143
01:30:41,194 --> 01:30:42,194
Does he have a big dick?

1144
01:30:42,462 --> 01:30:44,946
Look I'm not going to talk about
his dick with you, ok?

1145
01:30:44,947 --> 01:30:46,140
It's not like that.

1146
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:49,251
Not like what?
Doesn't he have one?

1147
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:52,204
Why don't you want to talk about it
I mean.

1148
01:30:52,372 --> 01:30:55,173
I tell you every single detail
about every guy that I fuck.

1149
01:30:55,341 --> 01:30:57,485
Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, alright?

1150
01:30:58,253 --> 01:31:00,104
Maybe I really don't want
to hear about all that.

1151
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:03,707
So now that you have a boyfriend,
you're above it?

1152
01:31:05,385 --> 01:31:06,819
We got to get you a real man.

1153
01:31:28,825 --> 01:31:30,676
You got any papers?
Yeah.

1154
01:31:30,677 --> 01:31:32,111
In the cigar box right over there.

1155
01:31:32,579 --> 01:31:35,097
You know put up a fight, dude.
You are such a pushover.

1156
01:31:35,165 --> 01:31:36,815
No, I can't, really no. Ok.

1157
01:31:37,083 --> 01:31:38,818
You should learn to roll a joint.

1158
01:32:44,025 --> 01:32:45,809
Hi.
Where's Mom?

1159
01:32:47,278 --> 01:32:47,808
Don't know.

1160
01:32:48,109 --> 01:32:49,488
Hi, Mr. Burnham.

1161
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:51,218
Hi.

1162
01:32:51,619 --> 01:32:53,125
Look at you.

1163
01:32:54,410 --> 01:32:55,779
Have you been working out?

1164
01:32:55,780 --> 01:32:56,828
Some.

1165
01:33:02,126 --> 01:33:03,661
You can really tell.

1166
01:33:07,006 --> 01:33:08,674
Look at those arms.

1167
01:33:13,179 --> 01:33:15,147
You like muscles?

1168
01:33:17,433 --> 01:33:20,469
I should probably go see
what Jane's up to.

1169
01:33:33,241 --> 01:33:34,458
Where did you get that?

1170
01:33:37,370 --> 01:33:38,587
From my job.

1171
01:33:38,955 --> 01:33:40,114
Don't lie to me.

1172
01:33:43,042 --> 01:33:44,384
Now, I saw you with him.

1173
01:33:46,421 --> 01:33:47,580
You were watching me?

1174
01:33:50,049 --> 01:33:51,542
What did he make you do?

1175
01:33:55,138 --> 01:33:57,347
Dad, you don't really think
me and Mr. Burnham...

1176
01:33:57,348 --> 01:33:58,924
Don't you laugh at me!

1177
01:34:00,768 --> 01:34:05,397
Now, I will not sit back and watch
my only son become a cocksucker!

1178
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:06,840
Jesus! What is it with you?

1179
01:34:11,821 --> 01:34:15,365
I swear to God, I'll throw you out of
this house and never look at you again!

1180
01:34:16,033 --> 01:34:17,169
You mean that.

1181
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:19,294
You're damn straight I do!

1182
01:34:19,662 --> 01:34:22,981
I'd rather you were dead
than be a fucking faggot!

1183
01:34:34,927 --> 01:34:35,945
You're right.

1184
01:34:40,475 --> 01:34:41,826
I suck dick for money.

1185
01:34:41,827 --> 01:34:43,226
Boy, don't start!

1186
01:34:43,894 --> 01:34:45,896
$2,000. I'm that good.

1187
01:34:45,964 --> 01:34:47,089
Get out!

1188
01:34:47,157 --> 01:34:48,524
And you should see me fuck!

1189
01:34:49,492 --> 01:34:51,535
I'm the best piece of ass in three states!

1190
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:53,218
Damn it, get out!

1191
01:34:53,519 --> 01:34:55,414
I don't ever want to see you again!

1192
01:35:01,746 --> 01:35:02,824
What a sad,

1193
01:35:03,325 --> 01:35:05,115
old man you are.

1194
01:35:07,293 --> 01:35:08,303
Get out.

1195
01:35:34,737 --> 01:35:35,737
Mom...

1196
01:35:37,698 --> 01:35:38,753
I'm leaving.

1197
01:35:39,354 --> 01:35:40,354
Ok.

1198
01:35:43,463 --> 01:35:44,847
Wear a raincoat.

1199
01:35:52,630 --> 01:35:54,715
I wish things would have been better for you.

1200
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:01,063
Take care of Dad.

1201
01:36:33,212 --> 01:36:35,714
<i>Disinvesting problems of power</i>

1202
01:36:35,882 --> 01:36:38,717
<i>and removing their ability to make us afraid.</i>

1203
01:36:38,885 --> 01:36:42,095
<i>This is the secret to Me-Centered Living.</i>

1204
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:47,225
<i>Only by taking full responsibility
for your actions and their solutions,</i>

1205
01:36:47,393 --> 01:36:51,480
<i>will you ever break free from
the constant cycle of victimhood.</i>

1206
01:36:51,647 --> 01:36:55,139
<i>You are only a victim if you
choose to be a victim.</i>

1207
01:36:55,165 --> 01:36:56,843
<i>We all have the power...</i>

1208
01:36:57,586 --> 01:36:59,264
I don't think we can be friends anymore.

1209
01:36:59,665 --> 01:37:01,731
You're way too uptight about sex.

1210
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:04,235
Just don't fuck my dad, alright?

1211
01:37:05,203 --> 01:37:06,390
Please?

1212
01:37:06,491 --> 01:37:07,320
Why not?

1213
01:37:08,623 --> 01:37:11,266
Dad, leave us alone!
It's me.

1214
01:37:13,586 --> 01:37:15,470
If I had to leave tonight,
would you come with me?

1215
01:37:15,638 --> 01:37:16,255
What?

1216
01:37:16,581 --> 01:37:20,183
If I had to go to New York to live,
tonight, would you come with me?

1217
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:23,416
Yes.

1218
01:37:23,717 --> 01:37:25,789
You guys can't be serious!

1219
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:28,733
You're just a kid, and he's,
like a mental case.

1220
01:37:28,901 --> 01:37:30,952
You'll end up living in a box on the street.

1221
01:37:31,020 --> 01:37:32,907
I'm no more a kid than you are!

1222
01:37:32,908 --> 01:37:34,773
We can use my plastic surgery money.

1223
01:37:34,941 --> 01:37:37,167
We won't have to.
I have over $40,000.

1224
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:39,611
I know people in the city
that can help us.

1225
01:37:39,779 --> 01:37:41,281
What, other drug dealers?

1226
01:37:41,282 --> 01:37:42,030
Yes.

1227
01:37:42,198 --> 01:37:44,449
Jane, you'd be out of your mind
to go with him.

1228
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:46,008
Why do you even care?

1229
01:37:46,009 --> 01:37:47,510
Because you're my friend!

1230
01:37:47,578 --> 01:37:48,677
She's not your friend.

1231
01:37:49,203 --> 01:37:51,498
She's someone you use
to feel better about yourself.

1232
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:53,659
Go fuck yourself, psycho!

1233
01:37:53,660 --> 01:37:54,793
Shut up, bitch!

1234
01:37:54,961 --> 01:37:56,220
Jane! He's a freak!

1235
01:37:56,221 --> 01:37:57,937
Well, then so am I!

1236
01:37:58,005 --> 01:38:01,266
And we'll always be freaks,
and we'll never be like other people.

1237
01:38:01,634 --> 01:38:04,803
And you'll never be a freak
because you're just too perfect!

1238
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:09,483
Yeah, well, at least I'm not ugly.

1239
01:38:11,978 --> 01:38:13,087
Yes, you are.

1240
01:38:13,654 --> 01:38:15,028
And you're boring.

1241
01:38:15,629 --> 01:38:17,290
And you're totally ordinary.

1242
01:38:18,526 --> 01:38:19,735
And you know it.

1243
01:38:22,405 --> 01:38:24,173
You two deserve each other.

1244
01:39:25,426 --> 01:39:27,018
Jesus, man, you're soaked!

1245
01:39:38,397 --> 01:39:40,332
You want me to get Ricky?
He's in Jane's room.

1246
01:39:43,402 --> 01:39:44,578
Are you ok?

1247
01:39:45,446 --> 01:39:47,172
Where's your wife?

1248
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:50,626
I don't know.

1249
01:39:51,494 --> 01:39:54,196
Probably out fucking that dorky
prince of real estate asshole.

1250
01:39:56,707 --> 01:39:57,908
And you know what?

1251
01:39:59,919 --> 01:40:01,211
I don't care.

1252
01:40:11,806 --> 01:40:13,951
Your wife is with another man and...

1253
01:40:15,152 --> 01:40:16,334
you don't care?

1254
01:40:19,105 --> 01:40:20,105
Nope.

1255
01:40:20,606 --> 01:40:23,174
Our marriage is just for show.

1256
01:40:24,443 --> 01:40:27,087
A commercial for how normal we are...

1257
01:40:27,655 --> 01:40:29,314
when we're anything but...

1258
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:38,957
Jesus, man, you are shaking.

1259
01:40:40,126 --> 01:40:42,261
We really ought to get you
out of these clothes.

1260
01:40:43,129 --> 01:40:44,129
Yeah.

1261
01:40:46,549 --> 01:40:47,699
It's 0k.

1262
01:40:52,054 --> 01:40:53,705
I am...

1263
01:40:55,641 --> 01:40:57,009
Just tell me what you need.

1264
01:41:02,064 --> 01:41:03,273
It's ok.

1265
01:41:25,337 --> 01:41:26,463
I'm sorry.

1266
01:41:28,048 --> 01:41:29,449
You got the wrong idea.

1267
01:42:07,296 --> 01:42:09,756
<i>I refuse to be a victim.</i>

1268
01:42:09,924 --> 01:42:11,831
<i>When this becomes your mantra,</i>

1269
01:42:11,832 --> 01:42:13,843
<i>constantly reinforcing your new...</i>

1270
01:42:17,932 --> 01:42:21,100
I refuse to be a victim!

1271
01:43:05,187 --> 01:43:07,189
I hope you don't mind
if I play the stereo.

1272
01:43:07,857 --> 01:43:09,091
Not at all.

1273
01:43:11,485 --> 01:43:12,686
Bad night?

1274
01:43:13,654 --> 01:43:14,988
Not really bad. Just...

1275
01:43:16,490 --> 01:43:17,549
strange.

1276
01:43:18,617 --> 01:43:19,603
Believe me,

1277
01:43:19,604 --> 01:43:22,487
it couldn't possibly be any stranger
than mine.

1278
01:43:31,714 --> 01:43:33,098
Jane and I had a fight.

1279
01:43:35,301 --> 01:43:36,534
It was about you.

1280
01:43:39,471 --> 01:43:41,014
She's mad at me because...

1281
01:43:42,808 --> 01:43:44,642
I said I think you're sexy.

1282
01:43:47,855 --> 01:43:48,872
Do you want a sip?

1283
01:43:50,173 --> 01:43:51,257
Sure.

1284
01:44:20,429 --> 01:44:21,488
So...

1285
01:44:24,308 --> 01:44:25,725
are you going to tell me?

1286
01:44:29,647 --> 01:44:30,922
What do you want?

1287
01:44:35,110 --> 01:44:36,294
I don't know.

1288
01:44:38,948 --> 01:44:39,998
You...

1289
01:44:40,824 --> 01:44:41,925
don't know.

1290
01:44:43,535 --> 01:44:45,487
What do you want?

1291
01:44:47,206 --> 01:44:48,331
Are you kidding?

1292
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:51,443
I want you.

1293
01:44:56,340 --> 01:44:59,158
I've wanted you since
the first moment I saw you.

1294
01:45:02,346 --> 01:45:04,906
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

1295
01:45:13,565 --> 01:45:15,266
You don't think I'm ordinary?

1296
01:45:18,737 --> 01:45:20,847
You couldn't be ordinary if you tried.

1297
01:45:24,443 --> 01:45:25,661
Thank you.

1298
01:45:27,871 --> 01:45:30,690
I don't think there's anything worse
than being ordinary.

1299
01:45:50,811 --> 01:45:52,413
I refuse to be a victim.

1300
01:45:53,781 --> 01:45:55,198
I refuse to be a victim.

1301
01:45:56,066 --> 01:45:56,999
Lester...

1302
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,053
I have something I have to say to you.

1303
01:46:50,871 --> 01:46:51,971
Are you scared?

1304
01:46:53,499 --> 01:46:54,833
I don't get scared.

1305
01:46:58,504 --> 01:47:00,038
My parents will try to find me.

1306
01:47:01,173 --> 01:47:02,382
Mine won't.

1307
01:47:24,363 --> 01:47:26,064
This is my first time.

1308
01:47:29,960 --> 01:47:31,253
You're kidding.

1309
01:47:32,121 --> 01:47:33,371
I'm sorry.

1310
01:47:34,832 --> 01:47:36,374
I still want to do it.

1311
01:47:36,542 --> 01:47:37,642
I just...

1312
01:47:38,210 --> 01:47:40,142
thought I should tell you,

1313
01:47:40,143 --> 01:47:43,005
in case you wondered why, I wasn't...

1314
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:45,884
better.

1315
01:47:58,647 --> 01:47:59,731
What's wrong?

1316
01:48:06,989 --> 01:48:08,731
I thought you said I was beautiful.

1317
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:12,427
You are beautiful.

1318
01:48:15,706 --> 01:48:17,215
You are so...

1319
01:48:18,208 --> 01:48:19,409
beautiful.

1320
01:48:22,546 --> 01:48:23,822
And I would be a very...

1321
01:48:25,799 --> 01:48:26,824
lucky man.

1322
01:48:28,343 --> 01:48:30,295
I feel so stupid.

1323
01:48:30,762 --> 01:48:31,797
Don't.

1324
01:48:34,766 --> 01:48:36,001
I'm sorry.

1325
01:48:36,768 --> 01:48:39,170
You have nothing to be sorry about.

1326
01:48:40,939 --> 01:48:42,007
It's ok.

1327
01:48:43,901 --> 01:48:45,010
Everything's ok.

1328
01:49:02,727 --> 01:49:04,329
I was starving.

1329
01:49:05,964 --> 01:49:07,317
Do you want me to make another one?

1330
01:49:07,718 --> 01:49:09,067
No, no, no, I'm fine.

1331
01:49:09,635 --> 01:49:10,643
You sure?

1332
01:49:12,095 --> 01:49:15,556
I'm still a little weirded out,
but I feel better.

1333
01:49:15,724 --> 01:49:16,799
Thanks.

1334
01:49:20,604 --> 01:49:21,654
How's Jane?

1335
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:24,073
What do you mean?

1336
01:49:25,817 --> 01:49:26,817
I mean...

1337
01:49:28,278 --> 01:49:29,371
how's her life?

1338
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:31,965
Is she happy?

1339
01:49:32,432 --> 01:49:34,059
Is she miserable?

1340
01:49:36,370 --> 01:49:37,598
I'd really like to know and...

1341
01:49:37,999 --> 01:49:40,256
she'd die before she'd
ever tell me about it.

1342
01:49:43,752 --> 01:49:44,523
She's...

1343
01:49:46,324 --> 01:49:48,139
she is really happy.

1344
01:49:49,841 --> 01:49:51,142
She thinks she's in love.

1345
01:50:03,897 --> 01:50:05,056
Good for her.

1346
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:10,861
How are you?

1347
01:50:18,829 --> 01:50:21,122
It's been a long time
since anybody asked me that.

1348
01:50:28,714 --> 01:50:29,831
I'm great.

1349
01:50:37,222 --> 01:50:38,497
I've got to go to the bathroom.

1350
01:50:52,946 --> 01:50:54,113
I'm great.

1351
01:51:29,441 --> 01:51:30,667
Man, oh, man.

1352
01:51:34,446 --> 01:51:37,156
