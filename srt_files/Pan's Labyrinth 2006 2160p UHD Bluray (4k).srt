1
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:07,010
<i>Spain, 1944</i>

2
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,570
<i>The Civil War is over.</i>

3
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,700
<i>Hidden in the mountains,</i>

4
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,910
<i>armed men are still fighting
the new Fascist regime.</i>

5
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:16,170
<i>Military posts are established
to exterminate the Resistance.</i>

6
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,060
A long time ago,

7
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:50,110
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

8
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,170
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

9
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:02,380
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

10
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,700
One day,

11
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,060
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

12
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,960
Once outside...

13
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,070
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

14
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:31,220
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

15
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,920
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

16
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,500
However, her father, the king,

17
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:44,820
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

18
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,800
perhaps in another body,

19
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,000
in another place, at another time.

20
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,940
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

21
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,570
until the world stopped turning.

22
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,940
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

23
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,710
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

24
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,890
Fairy tales?

25
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:23,400
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,380
Ask him to stop the car.

27
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:45,360
Ofelia, wait.

28
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,650
Your brother's not well.

29
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,420
Madam, are you okay?

30
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,240
Ofelia?

31
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:05,530
Ofelia, Come here.

32
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,980
-l saw a fairy.
-Just look at your shoes!

33
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,200
Let's go.

34
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,250
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

35
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,320
l want you to call him Father.

36
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,190
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

37
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,890
lt's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

38
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,550
They're coming, Captain.

39
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,050
15 minutes late.

40
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,170
Carmen.

41
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,960
Welcome.

42
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,190
That's not necessary.
l can walk perfectly well.

43
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,140
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

44
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,700
No.

45
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,730
Come.
Do it for me.

46
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,000
Thank you.

47
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,030
Ofelia, come out.

48
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,150
Say hello to the Captain.

49
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,240
Ofelia.

50
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,590
lt's the other hand, Ofelia.

51
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,560
Mercedes!

52
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,670
-Bring the luggage.
-Sir.

53
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,940
lt's a labyrinth.

54
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,010
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

55
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,310
Even before the mill.

56
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,320
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

57
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,150
Thank you.

58
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,020
Have you read them all?

59
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,460
Mercedes!

60
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,550
The Captain is calling.

61
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,220
Your father needs me.

62
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,290
He's not my father.

63
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,720
The Captain is not my father.

64
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,230
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

65
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:02,700
He's not my father.

66
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,550
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

67
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,040
Have you seen my mother?

68
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,100
-lsn't she beautiful!
-Yes.

69
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,910
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

70
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,580
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

71
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,670
because it's hard
to track them up there.

72
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,150
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

73
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,970
We'll block all access
to the woods

74
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:45,410
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

75
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,480
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

76
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,550
We'll set up three
new command posts.

77
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,320
Here, here and here.

78
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,520
Mercedes.

79
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,330
-Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,140
This will help you sleep
through the night.

81
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,930
Just two drops just before bed.

82
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,270
Two drops only.

83
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,640
Very good.

84
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:21,820
All of it.
Good.

85
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,780
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

86
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,420
You or your nurse.

87
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,220
Good night.

88
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,760
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

89
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,910
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

90
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,390
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

91
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,320
This is all l could get.

92
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:02,550
l'm sorry.

93
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,450
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

94
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,960
Come here, Ofelia.

95
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,410
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

96
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,410
Are you afraid?

97
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,640
A little.

98
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,850
What's that noise?

99
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:13,050
Nothing, just the wind.

100
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:17,740
Nights here are different
from city nights.

101
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,690
There, you hear cars-tramway.

102
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:24,110
Here the houses are old.

103
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,860
They creak.

104
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,810
As if they were speaking.

105
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,290
Tomorrow, l'm going
to give you a surprise.

106
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,650
-A surprise?
-Yes.

107
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,640
-A book?
-No, something much better.

108
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,570
Why did you have to get married?

109
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,140
l was alone too long.

110
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,880
l'm with you.
You weren't alone.

111
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,410
You were never alone.

112
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,620
When you're older, you'll understand.
lt hasn't been easy for me either.

113
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,200
Your brother's at it again-

114
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,190
Tell him one of your stories.

115
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,430
l'm sure that'll calm down.

116
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,900
My brother, my brother...

117
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,510
Many, many years ago,

118
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,250
in a sad, faraway land,

119
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,080
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

120
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,420
At sunset,

121
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:49,350
on top of that mountain,

122
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,040
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

123
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,810
But no one dared go near it

124
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,440
because its thorns were full of poison.

125
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:15,250
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

126
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:19,950
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

127
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:31,870
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

128
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:38,330
forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

129
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,070
forever alone, until the end of time.

130
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,930
Come in.

131
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,230
-How is she?
-Very weak.

132
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,200
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

133
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,490
l'll sleep down here.

134
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,170
-And my son?
-Pardon?

135
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,310
Excuse us, Captain.

136
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,400
My son, how is he?

137
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,080
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

138
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,190
Very good.

139
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,080
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

140
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,030
-ls that your opinion?
-My professional opinion, yes, sir.

141
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,640
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

142
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,160
That's all.

143
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,110
One more thing, Captain.

144
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,140
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

145
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,420
Don't fuck with me.

146
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:58,880
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

147
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,380
Gunfire.

148
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,700
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

149
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:09,400
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

150
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,870
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

151
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,990
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

152
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,670
We found this weapon on him.
lt's been fired.

153
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,570
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

154
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,210
Again, keep quiet.

155
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,550
''No God, no country, no Master''?

156
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:39,150
-Just like that-how do you like that?
-Red prpaganda, Captain.

157
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,090
lt's not propaganda, sir.

158
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:44,100
lt's an old almanac, Captain.

159
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,800
We're just farmers.

160
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,230
Go on.

161
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,250
l went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

162
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,000
For my daughters. They're sick.

163
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,090
Rabbits, uh?

164
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,280
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

165
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,360
Leave him alone.

166
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,570
You killed him,
You killed him!

167
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:27,070
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

168
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:59,010
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

169
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,830
before you come bothering me.

170
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes, Captain.

171
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,970
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

172
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,730
Mother, there's something in the room.

173
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,090
Hello.

174
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:14,470
Did you follow me here?

175
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,410
Are you a fairy?

176
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,760
Look!

177
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,590
This is a fairy.

178
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,050
You want me to go with you?

179
00:19:57,670 --> 00:20:00,090
Outside? Where?

180
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,770
Hello?

181
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,670
Hello?

182
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,820
Echo.

183
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,860
Echo.

184
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,840
Hello?

185
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,220
Hello?

186
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,120
lt's you.

187
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,590
lt's you.
You've returned.

188
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,720
Don't be frightened,
l beg you.

189
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:19,000
Look, look.

190
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,900
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

191
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,220
Me?

192
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,250
l've had so many names...

193
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

194
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,470
l am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

195
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,570
l am...

196
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:59,850
l am a faun.

197
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:04,640
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

198
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:08,410
-No, l'm...
-You're Princess Moanna,

199
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:14,180
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

200
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,990
My father was a tailor.

201
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,220
You are not born of man.

202
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:21,700
lt was the moon that bore you.

203
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,160
Look on your left shoulder

204
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:27,300
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

205
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:37,700
your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

206
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,840
This is...

207
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,080
This is the last of them.

208
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:52,320
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

209
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,960
that you have not become a mortal.

210
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:06,170
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

211
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:15,140
This is The Book of Crossroads.

212
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:18,990
Open it, when you are alone

213
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:22,030
and it will show you your future,

214
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,460
show you what must be done.

215
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,400
But there's nothing in here.

216
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,920
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

217
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:39,960
They are too young.

218
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,530
-Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
-Yes, sir.

219
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:49,000
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

220
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:00,290
You should keep an eye on it.

221
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,520
As you wish, sir.

222
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,050
Cook these.

223
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,300
-He didn't like the coffee.
-He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

224
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,340
A fussy dandy!

225
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,640
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

226
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,470
-Where are we supposed to find that?
-The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

227
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,540
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

228
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:30,220
-And they don't shut up.
-Not even underwater.

229
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,190
l'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

230
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,580
Ofelia.

231
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:58,880
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

232
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:02,110
Look what l've made for you.

233
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,750
Do you like it?

234
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,550
What l wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

235
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,130
as fine as this when l was your age!

236
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,420
And look at the shoes!

237
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:17,490
-Do you like them?
-Yes, very pretty.

238
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,800
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

239
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,160
Ofelia?

240
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,800
Ofelia?

241
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,700
Hurry up.
l want to see the dress on you.

242
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:36,550
l want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

243
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:41,140
You'll look like a princess.

244
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,950
A princess?

245
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,020
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

246
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,610
And don't forget the beans.

247
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,210
-You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
-What a gorgeous dress!

248
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,130
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

249
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,430
Do you want some milk with honey?

250
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,910
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

251
00:29:26,310 --> 00:29:30,230
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

252
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,260
No.

253
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,430
But when l was a little girl,
l did.

254
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,110
l believed in a lot of things
l don't believe any more.

255
00:29:39,510 --> 00:29:41,240
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

256
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,300
Really?

257
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,690
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

258
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,380
-And a faun, too.
-A faun?

259
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:53,610
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

260
00:29:54,670 --> 00:29:57,680
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

261
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:58,980
Mercedes!

262
00:30:00,930 --> 00:30:01,900
Come with me.

263
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:14,380
Captain,
everything is here.

264
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,310
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

265
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,620
olives, bacon.

266
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,590
This-this is real tobacco.

267
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,950
And the ration cards.

268
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,650
-l need you to check the inventory.
-Very well.

269
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,150
Mercedes.

270
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,060
-The key.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,350
-ls this the only copy?
-The only one.

272
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,250
From now on, l'll carry it.

273
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,110
Captain.

274
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,490
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

275
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,880
lt's them.

276
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:21,630
''Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

277
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:27,840
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder.''

278
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,990
''They protected one another,

279
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:40,460
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

280
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,330
that grew on a hill, near the mill.''

281
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,630
''But now, the tree is dying.

282
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:51,630
lts branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

283
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:55,680
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

284
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,410
and won't let the tree thrive.

285
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,920
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

286
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,050
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

287
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,820
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again.''

288
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:38,150
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

289
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,790
They left in a hurry.

290
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,820
A dozen men, at most.

291
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,110
Antibiotics.

292
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,250
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

293
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,790
They're here.

294
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,120
Those sons of bitches are here.

295
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,120
and they're watching us.

296
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,770
Hey!

297
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,610
You left this behind!

298
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:44,340
And your lottery ticket!

299
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,970
Why don't you come back
and get it?

300
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,180
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

301
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,880
Hello.
l'm Princess Moanna,

302
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,730
and l'm not afraid of you.

303
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:13,440
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

304
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,660
eating all these bugs...

305
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:19,370
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

306
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:04,300
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

307
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,710
Yes, ma'am.

308
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,910
Have you checked the garden?

309
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,040
-And the barn?
-Yes, ma'am.

310
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,480
Where is that girl?

311
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,860
This way, please.

312
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:20,880
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

313
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,620
-Charmed.
-A pleasure to meet you.

314
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,530
From now on,
one ration card per family.

315
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,260
Take a look.

316
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,600
-One?
-Only one.

317
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,180
Captain, l'm not sure
it'll be enough.

318
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,570
lf people are careful,
it should be plenty.

319
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,850
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

320
00:39:39,970 --> 00:39:43,840
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

321
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,450
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

322
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:50,180
We almost got them.
We found this.

323
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,220
Antibiotics.

324
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:55,820
God has already
saved their souls.

325
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,720
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

326
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:01,380
We'll help however we can, Captain.

327
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,660
We know you're not here by choice.

328
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,090
You're wrong about that.

329
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,170
l choose to be here because l want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

330
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:18,240
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

331
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:20,070
that we're all equal.

332
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,150
But there's a big difference:

333
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:25,280
the war is over and we won.

334
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:28,820
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

335
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,990
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

336
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,760
We're all here by choice.

337
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,960
By choice!

338
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,670
Put the coffee on.
l'm going for more wood.

339
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,800
We'll take care of it.

340
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,930
Ofelia?

341
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,820
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

342
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,060
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

343
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,170
Oh, l see...

344
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:39,900
And after he died,
l went to work at the shop.

345
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,230
A little more than a year ago,

346
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,930
the Captain and l met again.

347
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,600
Curious, isn't it!

348
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:51,840
l mean, finding each other again?

349
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,040
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

350
00:41:56,320 --> 00:42:00,010
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

351
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:02,760
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

352
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,440
We understand.

353
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,020
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

354
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,160
Excuse me.

355
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,300
Have l told you that l was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

356
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,950
No.
l had no idea.

357
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,170
ln Morocco.

358
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:35,550
l knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

359
00:42:35,630 --> 00:42:36,820
An excellent soldier.

360
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,590
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

361
00:42:42,390 --> 00:42:44,050
he smashed his watch on a rock

362
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,750
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

363
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,190
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

364
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,800
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

365
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,610
What you've done hurts me.

366
00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:04,740
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

367
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,840
Are you listening?

368
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,080
Sometimes l think
you'll never learn to behave.

369
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,950
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

370
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,430
And your father, too.

371
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:23,170
You mean the Captain?

372
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,600
Him more than me.

373
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:42,480
l've got the key.

374
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:47,850
Take me to the Labyrinth.

375
00:44:41,110 --> 00:44:42,100
Hello.

376
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,720
l got the key out.

377
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:51,660
That's me,
and the girl is you.

378
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,190
And the baby?

379
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,790
So... you retrieved the key.

380
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:00,830
l'm glad.

381
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:13,770
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

382
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:16,840
She's so glad you succeeded.

383
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:24,280
Keep the key.

384
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,880
You'll be needing it very soon.

385
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,960
And this too?
a piece of chalk.

386
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,670
Two tasks remain

387
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,510
and the moon is almost full.

388
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,400
Be patient.

389
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:53,380
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

390
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,020
How do l know
that what you say is true?

391
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:02,260
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

392
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,570
Proceed.

393
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,050
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

394
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:31,840
Let's go.
Your name?

395
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,090
Your names, first and last.

396
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:41,730
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

397
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,460
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

398
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,800
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

399
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,830
because in a united Spain,

400
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,710
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

401
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,500
Come on, show me
what happens now?

402
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,020
Show me.

403
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:56,660
Ofelia, help me...

404
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,390
Captain! Captain!

405
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,520
Come quickly.

406
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,360
... because in a united Spain,

407
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:14,320
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

408
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,120
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

409
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,000
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

410
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,780
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

411
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,340
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

412
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,170
l'll stay here until the birth.

413
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,620
Make her well.

414
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,970
l don't care what it costs
or what you need.

415
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,380
Make her well.

416
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:09,180
Don't worry.

417
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:12,840
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

418
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,840
Having a baby is complicated.

419
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,830
Then l'll never have one.

420
00:49:34,370 --> 00:49:37,200
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

421
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,180
Have you told anyone?

422
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,880
No, l haven't.

423
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:57,180
l don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

424
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,370
Nor l to you.

425
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:13,030
Do you know a lullaby?

426
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,250
Only one...

427
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:19,400
but l don't remember the words.

428
00:50:19,710 --> 00:50:23,310
l don't care.
l still want to hear it.

429
00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:19,430
Don't be afraid.
lt's only me.

430
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:30,350
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

431
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,650
Then let's go.

432
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,140
This is sheer madness.

433
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,930
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

434
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,570
-Have you thought about that?
-Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

435
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,930
lt's not fear...

436
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,900
at least not for myself.

437
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,080
Pedro!

438
00:52:03,390 --> 00:52:05,820
Pedro, My brother!

439
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,640
You didn't carry out the task.

440
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:28,070
No, my mother is sick.

441
00:52:29,610 --> 00:52:32,200
That's no excuse
for negligence.

442
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,350
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

443
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,330
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

444
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:46,920
Put it under your mother's bed

445
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,540
in a bowl of fresh milk.

446
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,090
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

447
00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:00,600
Now, we have no time
to waste.

448
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:03,670
The full moon will be upon us.

449
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,510
Take my pets
to guide you through.

450
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:14,710
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

451
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:17,700
The thing that slumbers there,

452
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,130
it is not human.

453
00:53:24,980 --> 00:53:29,230
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

454
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,140
but don't eat
or drink anything.

455
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:37,070
Absolutely nothing.

456
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,280
Your life depends on it.

457
00:54:02,940 --> 00:54:07,900
l've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

458
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,980
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

459
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,020
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

460
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,020
How do you think it's doing?
lt's fucked up.

461
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,080
Let's see.

462
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,420
... N-North American,

463
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,460
British and Canadian troops

464
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:35,090
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

465
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,630
-''France'', idiot.
-F-f-f-rance.

466
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,530
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

467
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:46,590
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

468
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,750
ls it really bad, doctor?

469
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,410
Look, Frenchie.

470
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,250
There's no way to save it.

471
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:10,430
l'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

472
00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:21,610
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

473
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:02,890
''Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room.''

474
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:12,020
''Once the door's open,
start the hourglass.''

475
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,470
''Let the fairies guide you.''

476
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:25,180
''Don't eat or drink anything,
during your stay,

477
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,970
and come back
before the last grain of sand falls.''

478
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:39,980
No...

479
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:44,020
This other one.

480
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,540
No! No!

481
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,260
We'll soon have reinforcements
from Jaca.

482
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:43,600
Fifty men or more.
Then we'll go head to head with Vidal.

483
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:47,130
And then what?

484
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,530
You kill him, they'll send another
just like him. And another...

485
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:55,340
You're screwed, no guns,
no safe shelter...

486
01:02:55,450 --> 01:02:59,680
You need food, medicine.
You must take care of Mercedes.

487
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,650
lf you really love her,
you'd cross the border with her.

488
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,150
-This is a lost cause.
-l'm staying here, doctor.

489
01:03:04,490 --> 01:03:05,450
There's no choice.

490
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,030
You have to leave.

491
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,740
Here's the key,
but you can't go down there now.

492
01:03:24,010 --> 01:03:26,240
lt's exactly what he expects.

493
01:03:29,410 --> 01:03:30,380
Leave it to me.

494
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:35,580
l'm a coward.

495
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,210
No, you're not.

496
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,620
Yes, l am.

497
01:03:42,260 --> 01:03:46,700
A coward... for living
next to that son of a bitch,

498
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,800
doing his laundry, making his bed,
feeding him.

499
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,000
What if the doctor's right
and we can't win?

500
01:04:01,310 --> 01:04:03,540
At least we'll make things
harder for that bastard.

501
01:05:58,430 --> 01:05:59,400
Captain Vidal...

502
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,020
Her temperature's down.
l don't know how, but it is.

503
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:05,770
But she still has a fever?

504
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:09,300
Yes, but it's a good sign.
Her body is responding.

505
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,070
Listen to me.

506
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:15,770
lf you have to choose,
save the baby.

507
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:18,470
That boy will bear my name
and my father's name.

508
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:19,600
Save him.

509
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:56,590
Brother...

510
01:06:58,590 --> 01:06:59,520
Little brother...

511
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:03,280
lf you can hear me,

512
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:06,560
things out here aren't too good.

513
01:07:08,430 --> 01:07:10,420
But soon you'll have to come out.

514
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:13,330
You've made Mama very sick.

515
01:07:15,540 --> 01:07:19,170
l want to ask you one favor
for when you come out,

516
01:07:20,310 --> 01:07:21,440
just one:

517
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,440
don't hurt her.

518
01:07:25,650 --> 01:07:28,880
You'll meet her,
she's very pretty,

519
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,980
even though sometimes she's sad
for days at a time.

520
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,950
You'll see, when she smiles,

521
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,050
you'll love her.

522
01:07:40,430 --> 01:07:43,730
Listen, if you do what l say,

523
01:07:44,030 --> 01:07:45,590
l'll make you a promise,

524
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,170
l'll take you to my kingdom,
and l'll make you a prince.

525
01:07:51,170 --> 01:07:54,340
l promise you, a prince.

526
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,530
l sounded the whistle,
but they wouldn't move.

527
01:08:23,740 --> 01:08:26,140
l tried to stop, but it was too late.

528
01:08:26,210 --> 01:08:28,640
The fireman and l
jumped outjust in time,

529
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:30,280
but look at the mess they made.

530
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:35,180
What did they steal
from the freight cars?

531
01:08:35,690 --> 01:08:37,480
They didn't open a single one.

532
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:39,190
What the hell are you talking about?

533
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:41,620
This whole mess...
They didn't open any of the cars.

534
01:08:41,820 --> 01:08:46,120
-They didn't take anything.
-Nothing? Are you sure?

535
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:50,360
God only knows what they wanted,
other than to waste our time.

536
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:08,980
They came out of nowhere, Captain.

537
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:15,490
They have grenades,
they went up hill.

538
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,990
Captain, we've surrounded
a small unit that fell behind.

539
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,820
They took cover up on the hill.

540
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:04,400
Go ahead, Serrano, don't be afraid,
this is the only decent way to die.

541
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,310
Serrano!

542
01:11:06,540 --> 01:11:09,560
Let me see.

543
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,400
Can you talk?

544
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:20,780
Damn it!

545
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:41,960
These are useless! They can't talk.

546
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:53,940
Captain,
this one's still alive.

547
01:11:58,020 --> 01:11:59,390
Shot in the leg.

548
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:06,690
-What's happened?
-They caught one.

549
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,160
They took one of them alive.
And they're taking him to the storeroom.

550
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:15,500
Mercedes!

551
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:18,570
Pedro... Pedro...

552
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:36,990
Mercedes?

553
01:12:37,930 --> 01:12:40,920
-l need to get into the storeroom.
-Not now.

554
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,760
Move away!

555
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:12,090
That's plenty, dear.

556
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:17,160
Should l take this up?

557
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:39,490
Here, half the dose.

558
01:13:39,990 --> 01:13:41,790
l don't think l need it.

559
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:45,080
l feel better, much better.

560
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,760
l don't understand.
But l'm glad.

561
01:13:51,100 --> 01:13:51,690
Mother...

562
01:14:06,450 --> 01:14:09,210
Damn, this cigarette is good!

563
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:13,390
Real tobacco hard to find.

564
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,420
G-G-Go to hell.

565
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:24,090
Damn, Garces. We catch one
and he turns out to be a stutterer.

566
01:14:24,370 --> 01:14:26,490
We'll be here all night.

567
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:28,670
As long as he talks.

568
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:36,370
Garces is right.

569
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:39,510
You'd do better
to tell us everything.

570
01:14:40,220 --> 01:14:43,580
But to make sure it happens,
l brought along a few tools.

571
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:48,120
Just things you pick up
along the way.

572
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,760
At first, l won't be able to trust you,

573
01:14:51,330 --> 01:14:54,790
but after l use this,
you'll own up to a few things.

574
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:58,300
When we get to these,

575
01:14:59,340 --> 01:15:03,000
we'll have developed...
how can l put this-?

576
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:06,000
A closer bond,
much like brothers.

577
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,970
You'll see.

578
01:15:10,980 --> 01:15:12,640
And when we get to this one,

579
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,450
l'll believe anything you tell me.

580
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,060
l'll make you a deal.

581
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:33,660
lf you can count to three
without st-t-tuttering,

582
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,200
you can go.

583
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:40,310
Don't look at him, look at me.

584
01:15:40,580 --> 01:15:42,340
Above me, there's no one.

585
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:44,780
-Garces!
-Yes, Captain?

586
01:15:45,050 --> 01:15:48,570
lf l say this asshole can leave,
would anybody contradict me?

587
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,280
No one, Captain.
He can leave.

588
01:15:51,020 --> 01:15:55,150
There you have it.
Count to three.

589
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:14,170
-One.
-Good.

590
01:16:18,410 --> 01:16:19,380
Two.

591
01:16:21,150 --> 01:16:24,050
One more and you will be free.

592
01:16:40,970 --> 01:16:41,940
Shame.

593
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:57,880
Your mother is much better,
Your Highness.

594
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:05,390
Surely, you must be relieved.

595
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,990
Yes, thank you.

596
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,860
But things haven't turned out so well.

597
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:13,860
No?

598
01:17:15,670 --> 01:17:19,300
-l had an accident.
-An accident?

599
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:20,440
Yes.

600
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,620
-You broke the rules!
-lt was only two grapes!

601
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,310
l thought no one would notice.

602
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:38,820
-We've made a mistake!
-A mistake?

603
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:43,290
You failed.
You can never return.

604
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:47,060
-lt was an accident!
-You cannot return.

605
01:17:47,170 --> 01:17:51,130
The moon will be full in three days.

606
01:17:51,710 --> 01:17:57,410
Your spirit shall forever remain
among the humans.

607
01:17:57,510 --> 01:18:01,380
You shall age like them,
you shall die like them

608
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:05,550
and all memory of you
shall fade in time.

609
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:10,120
And we'll vanish along with it.

610
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,560
You will never see us again.

611
01:18:25,270 --> 01:18:29,010
Good day, doctor.
Sorry to wake you so early,

612
01:18:29,750 --> 01:18:31,470
but l think we need your help.

613
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,360
My God, what have you done to him?

614
01:18:56,540 --> 01:18:57,670
Not much.

615
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,410
But things are getting better.

616
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:14,050
l like having you handy, Doctor.
lt has its advantages.

617
01:19:15,590 --> 01:19:17,060
Serrano, stay here.

618
01:19:17,230 --> 01:19:18,280
l talked.

619
01:19:19,700 --> 01:19:20,920
Not much.

620
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:26,740
-B-b-but l talked.
-l'm sorry.

621
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,060
l'm so sorry.

622
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:41,340
Kill me.
Kill me now, please.

623
01:19:57,530 --> 01:19:59,130
Son of a bitch.

624
01:20:20,220 --> 01:20:22,160
lt'll take away the pain.

625
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:30,000
lt's almost over.

626
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,070
Watch Dr. Ferreiro,

627
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,680
-l'll be right there.
-Yes, Captain.

628
01:21:05,230 --> 01:21:06,830
You're not moving anymore.

629
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:09,770
Are you sick?

630
01:21:12,980 --> 01:21:15,500
What are you doing down there?

631
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,750
-Call him!
-Who?

632
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:33,260
Who else, you imbecile?
Ferreiro!

633
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:59,450
What the hell is this?

634
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:04,120
No! No, no!

635
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:07,960
Leave her.
Leave her alone, please!

636
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:12,230
Look at this! Look what she
was hiding under your bed!

637
01:22:12,630 --> 01:22:13,830
What do you think of this?

638
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:22,930
Ofelia, what is this thing doing
under the bed?

639
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:27,080
lt's a magic root
the faun gave me.

640
01:22:27,250 --> 01:22:29,840
This is all because of thatjunk
you let her read.

641
01:22:30,190 --> 01:22:31,150
Look what you've done!

642
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:35,350
Please, leave us alone.
l'll talk to her, darling.

643
01:22:35,990 --> 01:22:38,930
Fine.
As you wish.

644
01:22:40,730 --> 01:22:43,430
He told me you would get better.
And you did.

645
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,600
Ofelia, you have to listen
to your father.

646
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,030
You have to stop all this.

647
01:22:49,710 --> 01:22:52,330
No. l want to leave this place!

648
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:55,840
Please, take me away from here!
Let's just go, Please!

649
01:22:55,980 --> 01:22:58,280
Things are not that simple.

650
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:02,350
You're getting older,

651
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:06,750
soon you'll see that life
isn't like your fairy tales.

652
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,550
The world is a cruel place.

653
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:14,660
And you'll learn that,
even if it hurts.

654
01:23:16,270 --> 01:23:18,790
-No! No!
-Ofelia!

655
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:25,100
Magic does not exist.
Not for you, me or anyone else.

656
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:39,180
Mom! Help!

657
01:23:39,660 --> 01:23:41,090
Help!

658
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:43,220
Help!

659
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:50,230
Why did you do it?

660
01:23:52,570 --> 01:23:54,230
lt was the only thing l could do.

661
01:23:55,570 --> 01:23:57,800
No. You could have obeyed me.

662
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,840
l could have, but l didn't.

663
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,300
lt would have been better for you.
You know it.

664
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:10,690
l don't understand.
Why didn't you obey me?

665
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:17,120
To obey-just like that-for the sake
of obeying, without questioning...

666
01:24:18,860 --> 01:24:21,850
that's something only people
like you can do, Captain.

667
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,630
Captain!

668
01:25:06,940 --> 01:25:09,310
Garces! Call the troop paramedic.

669
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:12,000
-Get up immediately!
-Yes, Captain.

670
01:25:46,650 --> 01:25:48,510
Your wife is dead.

671
01:25:58,190 --> 01:26:01,690
Because the paths to the Lord
are inscrutable.

672
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:04,030
Because the essence
of His forgiveness

673
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:07,430
lies in His word
and in His mystery.

674
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:11,300
Because although God
sends us the message,

675
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:14,070
it is our task to decipher it.

676
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,770
Because when we open our arms

677
01:26:16,950 --> 01:26:21,810
the earth takes in only a hollow
and senseless shell.

678
01:26:23,190 --> 01:26:26,120
Far away now is the soul
in its eternal glory.

679
01:26:26,720 --> 01:26:30,390
Because it is in pain
that we find the meaning of life.

680
01:26:31,190 --> 01:26:34,130
And the state of grace
that we lose when we are born.

681
01:26:35,460 --> 01:26:40,730
Because God, in His infinite wisdom,
puts the solution in our hands.

682
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:47,300
And because it is only
in His physical absence,

683
01:26:47,480 --> 01:26:51,740
that the place He occupies
in our souls is reaffirmed.

684
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,190
You knew
Dr. Ferreiro pretty well,
didn't you, Mercedes?

685
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:21,210
We all knew him, sir.
Everyone around here.

686
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:26,810
The stutterer spoke of an informer.
Here... at the mill.

687
01:27:27,980 --> 01:27:31,850
Can you imagine?
Right under my nose.

688
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:37,130
Mercedes, please.

689
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:48,300
What must you think of me?

690
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,160
You must think that
l'm a monster.

691
01:27:51,710 --> 01:27:54,610
lt doesn't matter
what someone like me thinks, sir.

692
01:28:04,790 --> 01:28:07,690
l want you to the storehouse
and bring me some more liquor, please.

693
01:28:07,960 --> 01:28:11,150
Yes, sir.
Goodnight, sir.

694
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:15,690
Mercedes,
aren't you forgetting something?

695
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:17,720
Sir?

696
01:28:22,770 --> 01:28:23,670
The key.

697
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:27,040
l do have the only copy, don't l?

698
01:28:28,240 --> 01:28:29,230
Yes, sir.

699
01:28:30,780 --> 01:28:34,770
You know, there's an odd detail
that's been bothering me.

700
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:37,050
Maybe it's not important, but...

701
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:38,910
the day they broke into
the storehouse,

702
01:28:39,150 --> 01:28:41,490
with all those grenades
and explosives,

703
01:28:42,390 --> 01:28:43,880
the lock itself wasn't forced.

704
01:28:46,190 --> 01:28:49,790
As l said, it's probably
not important.

705
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:54,700
Be very careful.

706
01:28:56,810 --> 01:28:58,030
Good night, sir.

707
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:43,650
Ofelia, Ofelia!

708
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:45,940
Ofelia, l'm leaving tonight.

709
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:49,980
-Where to?
-l can't tell you. l can't tell you...

710
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:53,120
-Take me with you.
-No, no. l can't.

711
01:29:53,230 --> 01:29:56,250
l can't, my child. But l'll come
back for you, l promise.

712
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,520
Take me with you.

713
01:30:22,420 --> 01:30:23,720
l heard something.

714
01:30:28,700 --> 01:30:31,860
lt's nothing, don't worry.

715
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:42,200
Mercedes.

716
01:30:44,380 --> 01:30:45,350
Ofelia.

717
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,980
How long have
you known about her?

718
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:02,950
How long have you been
laughing at me?

719
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,390
Little bitch!

720
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,000
Watch her!

721
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:12,200
And if anyone tries to get in,

722
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:14,770
kill her first.

723
01:31:29,090 --> 01:31:30,060
Dry meat.

724
01:31:33,660 --> 01:31:34,650
Tobacco.

725
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,730
lf you had asked for it, l would have
given this to you, Mercedes.

726
01:31:45,940 --> 01:31:48,170
l want the names of whoever
wrote these letters.

727
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:52,070
And l want them
in front of me, tomorrow.

728
01:31:52,450 --> 01:31:53,470
Yes, Captain.

729
01:31:56,350 --> 01:31:57,820
You can go, Garces.

730
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:00,790
You're sure, Captain?

731
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:05,990
For God's sake,
she's just a woman.

732
01:32:09,970 --> 01:32:12,130
That's what you've always thought.

733
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:16,100
That's why l was able to get away with it.

734
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:21,000
-l was invisible to you.
-Damn.

735
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,640
You've found my weakness:
Pride.

736
01:32:27,050 --> 01:32:30,380
But it's your weak points
we're interested in.

737
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:35,690
lt's very simple: you will talk...

738
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:38,420
And l have to know

739
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:41,690
that everything you say is the truth.

740
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:47,200
We have a few things here
strictly for that purpose.

741
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:50,400
Nothing complicated.

742
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:54,770
Things we learn on the job.

743
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:58,850
At first...

744
01:33:15,960 --> 01:33:19,200
l'm not some old man!
Not a wounded prisoner!

745
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:23,330
Mother Fucker!
Don't you dare touch the girl?

746
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:25,330
Won't be the first pig l gutted.

747
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:49,920
Look! He let her go.

748
01:33:52,430 --> 01:33:53,730
The fuck did you say?

749
01:34:01,740 --> 01:34:04,440
Get her!
Come on! Bring her to me!

750
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,710
Bring her to me, damn it!

751
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,340
Mount up!

752
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,770
lt'll be better if you come
with me without struggling.

753
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:16,440
The Captain said that if you behave...

754
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:22,850
Don't be a fool, sweetheart.

755
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,780
lf anyone's going to kill you...

756
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:28,090
l'd rather it be me.

757
01:36:38,470 --> 01:36:43,400
l've decided to give you
one last chance.

758
01:36:48,680 --> 01:36:50,370
Do you promise to do what l say?

759
01:36:52,380 --> 01:36:56,610
Will you do everything l tell you,
without question?

760
01:36:58,420 --> 01:37:01,390
This is your last chance.

761
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:05,650
Then listen to me.

762
01:37:06,090 --> 01:37:08,490
Fetch your brother

763
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:11,560
and bring him to the labyrinth,

764
01:37:11,700 --> 01:37:16,100
as quickly as you can,
Your Highness.

765
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:17,670
My brother?

766
01:37:17,910 --> 01:37:19,240
We need him.

767
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:22,430
-But...
-No more questions.

768
01:37:25,450 --> 01:37:27,000
The door's locked.

769
01:37:28,020 --> 01:37:33,920
ln that case,
create your own door.

770
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:23,990
Captain, with your permission.

771
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:28,390
Come quickly.

772
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:32,430
-Now what?
-Serrano is back. He's wounded.

773
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:34,770
Wounded?

774
01:41:20,980 --> 01:41:22,380
Where's Garces?

775
01:41:29,860 --> 01:41:30,850
How many were there?

776
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:33,620
l don't know exactly, Captain.

777
01:41:34,060 --> 01:41:35,550
Fifty men, at least.

778
01:41:35,660 --> 01:41:39,260
The rest of the men didn't make it.
Our watch posts are not responding.

779
01:41:39,400 --> 01:41:43,000
-How many men we have left?
-Twenty, maybe less, sir.

780
01:41:53,810 --> 01:41:57,180
We're leaving.
Together.

781
01:41:58,220 --> 01:41:59,480
Don't be afraid.

782
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:02,020
Nothing is going to happen to you.

783
01:42:08,400 --> 01:42:10,020
Put them on picket duty
at the tree line.

784
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,290
lf the rest of the squad gets back,
have it report immediately to me.

785
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:16,030
Radio for reinforcements, now.

786
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:17,500
Yes, Captain.

787
01:42:44,330 --> 01:42:45,560
Leave him!

788
01:43:31,650 --> 01:43:32,910
Ofelia!

789
01:45:00,070 --> 01:45:02,760
Quickly, Your Majesty,

790
01:45:03,040 --> 01:45:05,560
give him to me.

791
01:45:06,110 --> 01:45:09,200
The full moon is high in the sky,

792
01:45:09,310 --> 01:45:12,140
we can open the portal.

793
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:14,670
Why is that in your hand?

794
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:21,090
The portal will only open
if we offer the blood of an innocent.

795
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:25,830
Just a drop of blood.
A pinprick, that's all.

796
01:45:25,930 --> 01:45:28,520
lt's the final task.

797
01:45:28,830 --> 01:45:30,160
Hurry.

798
01:45:32,870 --> 01:45:35,960
You promised to obey me!

799
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,630
-Give me the boy!
-No!

800
01:45:39,240 --> 01:45:41,370
My brother stays with me.

801
01:45:41,610 --> 01:45:47,510
You would give up your sacred rights
for this brat you barely know?

802
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:50,380
Yes, l would.

803
01:45:51,690 --> 01:45:54,150
You would give up
your throne for him?

804
01:45:54,290 --> 01:45:58,880
He who has caused you
such misery, such humiliation?

805
01:45:59,430 --> 01:46:02,290
Yes, l would.

806
01:46:06,400 --> 01:46:12,100
As you wish, Your Highness.

807
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:28,850
No!

808
01:47:27,550 --> 01:47:28,540
My son.

809
01:47:56,140 --> 01:47:57,800
Tell my son...

810
01:48:03,650 --> 01:48:05,740
Tell him what time his father died.

811
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:07,850
-Tell him that l...
-No.

812
01:48:09,060 --> 01:48:10,820
He won't even know your name.

813
01:49:53,660 --> 01:49:55,690
Arise, my daughter.

814
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,260
Come.

815
01:50:26,490 --> 01:50:27,720
Father.

816
01:50:28,230 --> 01:50:31,860
You have spilled your own blood
rather than that of an innocent.

817
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:36,470
That was the final task,
and the most important.

818
01:50:46,980 --> 01:50:52,250
And you chose well,
Your Highness.

819
01:50:52,490 --> 01:50:54,150
Come here with me,

820
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:57,150
and sit by your father's side.

821
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:59,820
He's been waiting for you so long.

822
01:51:52,750 --> 01:51:56,510
And it is said the princess
returned to her father's kingdom.

823
01:51:57,450 --> 01:52:02,790
That she reigned there with justice
and a kind heart for many centuries.

824
01:52:03,690 --> 01:52:05,950
That she was loved by her people.

825
01:52:06,230 --> 01:52:10,930
And that she left behind
small traces of her time on earth,
