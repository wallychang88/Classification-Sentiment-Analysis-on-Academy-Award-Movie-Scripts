1
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,977
Jesus Christ! Look at this.
My sneakers ruined!

2
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,933
They're only $35.

3
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,815
Fucking city's turned into
one big pile of dog shit!

4
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,570
Come on out and take a crap on me!
Everybody else is!

5
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,443
Fuck. Give it back to the poodles.

6
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:46,325
What's the point of jogging
for two and a half miles?

7
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,826
Giving yourself lung cancer.

8
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,104
Tell you somethin', Erica.
The longer I'm married to you,

9
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,959
the more you sound like my mother.

10
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,087
Clean your own sneaker.

11
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,885
- I think you wanted me to step in it.
- You're going crazy, Martin.

12
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,724
Yeah? Yeah.

13
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,375
Why would I want you to step in dog shit?

14
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,373
Well, that's a good question.

15
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,507
- Oh, god.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

16
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:42,594
I'm not your mother.

17
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,759
You know. Yeah.

18
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:48,467
Listen, do you think we got time
for a little quickie?

19
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,474
I got about 11 minutes.

20
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,017
Hey, come on.

21
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:58,610
Gimme a break here. I'm gettin' frostbite.

22
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,325
Jesus, I got to quit smoking.

23
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,791
- I saw Jacobs on Tuesday. Did I tell you?
- Uh-uh.

24
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,164
How are you?

25
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,170
Fine.

26
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,421
You sound surprised.

27
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,183
Well, you know,
I go up there for the damn thing,

28
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:29,842
and my blood pressure goes up 20 points
from anxiety of having to take the exam.

29
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,645
- What are you doing today?
- Working at the gallery.

30
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,724
Yeah - -

31
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,183
going to school.

32
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:43,949
=... 1

33
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:49,736
- hi, sweetie.
- Hi

34
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,870
hmm. Did the earth move?

35
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:58,881
Bye.

36
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,833
I'm telling you,
we expose that kid to too much.

37
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:05,840
- Well, we still lock the door.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

38
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,936
Have a good time. See you tonight.

39
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:42,206
"Tonight, the ballet world was introduced

40
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,586
to a brilliant new talent -

41
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,628
the long-awaited debut...

42
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,263
Of Erica Benton.

43
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:55,640
Miss Benton astounded
the ballet world last night

44
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:59,097
in her incredible performance of

45
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,399
swan lake."

46
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,083
"Her pas de deux were breathtaking."

47
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:20,812
- Hello.
- Hi.

48
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,403
There she is.

49
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,364
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

50
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,013
- You look great.
- Oh, I'm sorry I'm late.

51
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,652
You're just in time for the big news.

52
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:39,114
- Well.
- Oh, hi. Uh -

53
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:42,163
- wine.
- Let's have a glass and another carafe.

54
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,289
- Okay.
- Yeah. And, uh -

55
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,246
- anything else?
- Steamer.

56
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,672
Refills for everybody.

57
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,296
Are you ready? You're in love.

58
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:55,051
Would that I were. It's not my news. Sue.

59
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,881
Only thing that happened to me last week

60
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:59,013
was my elevator man
got arrested for flashing.

61
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,560
What is it, Jeannette?

62
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,231
I met a man.

63
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,347
Well, that's terrific.

64
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,480
- Well, there's a little problem.
- He's married.

65
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,106
No.

66
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,812
He's very young.
You're not close.

67
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,319
- How young?
- He's 19.

68
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,527
- Oh, Jesus.
- I know, I know.

69
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,111
- He's very mature.
- Nineteen?

70
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,073
The problem is:
Does she fuck him, or does she adopt him?

71
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:26,582
I'm a terrible person. I'm drunk,
and I'm giddy, and I'm going to the loo.

72
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,130
- Sorry, Jeannette.
- It's okay.

73
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,208
I think Elaine's going through
early menopause.

74
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:34,886
It is so ironic. I've dated so many men

75
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,306
in the last few years
that were my age or older,

76
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:42,469
and Steven - his name is Steven -

77
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:45,522
is the first man that I've really liked

78
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,723
since my divorce.

79
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:52,779
- Well, what's he like?
- He's calm, quiet. He doesn't come on.

80
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,901
He's very bright.

81
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:57,492
He's not afraid to be tender.

82
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,367
Well, if you were a man and
you were talking about a 19-year-old girl,

83
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,893
there would be no problem, would there?

84
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,578
No, I worry about Teddy.

85
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,041
How do you tell a 6-year-old child
his new daddy is a teenager?

86
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:12,916
Where does he live now?

87
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,585
With his parents.

88
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,045
Maybe I should adopt him.

89
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,755
Did I miss anything?

90
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:19,850
No.

91
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,723
It's just that
last night was so incredible.

92
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,014
I put Teddy to bed, and Steven came over.

93
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:32,436
We just sat and talked all night long.

94
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,112
- I mean, till 7:00 this morning.
- What did you talk about?

95
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,441
We talked a lot about loneliness.

96
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:39,735
Got kind of emotional.

97
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,909
Then?

98
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,952
- Promise you won't laugh?
- I promise.

99
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,708
Well, then he undressed me...

100
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,836
And he gave me a massage.

101
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:56,801
And it was the most incredible experience
I think I've ever had in my life.

102
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,719
I'll bet. Was it sexual?

103
00:10:00,225 --> 00:10:01,806
That's it. It was and it wasn't.

104
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,677
I mean, he massaged my feet and my toes,

105
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,855
and he massaged my fingers.

106
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,433
He massaged my eyes.

107
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,235
He actually massaged my eyes.

108
00:10:15,532 --> 00:10:17,068
And then I had an orgasm.

109
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,158
And then another and then another.

110
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:23,658
I'd say it was sexual.

111
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,595
There ain't nothin' wrong with a good,
old-fashioned highball orgasm.

112
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,411
Oh, I love them.
I mean, I couldn't live without them.

113
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:35,986
- Have you read the latest book?
- You think I'm going crazy, don't you?

114
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,966
Crazy? What's this boy's phone number?

115
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,090
- Don't be offended, okay?
- No. Why? What?

116
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:42,451
- Is he being honest with you?
- That's pretty naive, Erica.

117
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,619
- No, it isn't.
- No, it's not.

118
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,602
There's no such thing as total honesty.
Not with men.

119
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:49,729
They're all wrapped up in sexual ego.

120
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:53,024
- What the hell is sexual ego, Elaine?
- Never getting enough.

121
00:10:53,111 --> 00:10:56,069
Always on the make.
Constantly worried about performing.

122
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,362
That's ridiculous.

123
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:00,531
I know lots of men who are interested
in other things besides sex.

124
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,778
- Name one.
- My husband.

125
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:08,114
Harold hasn't made a pass in six months.

126
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:11,831
Well, listen, Elaine. Don't you think
you're taking this thing a little too far?

127
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,457
Me? No.

128
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,585
- I think you're getting to be a man-hater.
- I love men.

129
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,833
We're talking about their honesty.

130
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,671
- Do you think Martin is totally honest?
- I don't think about it.

131
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,427
I think Erica has the second-best man
in the five boroughs.

132
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,518
Thank you.

133
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,093
I think what I'm gonna do

134
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,645
is just go along with things
the way they are

135
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:33,974
- and just see what happens.
- Have fun, honey.

136
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,480
The worst that can happen
is that it'll end.

137
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:40,781
No, I think the worst that could happen
is that his parents will find out.

138
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,368
You're fabulous, Elaine.

139
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,288
- I love you.
- Swiftly moving on.

140
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:11,188
Patti?

141
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:19,905
Hello?

142
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,407
Hi.

143
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:28,237
- Girls had a long meeting tonight, uh?
- They're not meetings.

144
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,329
What's on the news?

145
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,916
Nothing. They're shooting up rhodesia,

146
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,745
and the garbagemen are raising hell again.
You know.

147
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,423
Jeannette is having an affair
with a 19-year-old boy.

148
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:42,842
Oh, shit. She's flipped.

149
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,011
Men go out with younger women
all the time.

150
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,006
Nineteen is four years older than Patti.

151
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,342
Yeah, where is Patti?

152
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,722
She went to the movies with Phil.

153
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,514
I like Phil.

154
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,854
Well, maybe Phil should meet Jeannette.

155
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,529
Martin.

156
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,646
How are Elaine and sue?

157
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,324
Fine.

158
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,490
Elaine makes me very nervous.

159
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,740
She likes you.

160
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:10,831
Yeah.

161
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,452
I like her all right.
She just comes on too strong.

162
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,078
So do you sometimes.

163
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:20,046
Sometimes I get the feeling that you
prefer Elaine and sue and Jeannette to me.

164
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,714
That's ridiculous, Martin.

165
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,294
Do you? Sometimes.

166
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,101
Look, Martin. Patti's coming home.

167
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:48,783
I have to get up early.

168
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,445
Martin, I'm not in the mood.

169
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:54,875
You give me a headache.

170
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,836
- Take an aspirin.
- Shit.

171
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,007
Anybody home?

172
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:08,969
We're in here, honey.

173
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,342
What's going on in there?

174
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,675
Want me to go out and come in again?

175
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,064
- How was the movie?
- Good.

176
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,612
We saw the new Lina wertmuller film.
Yeah?

177
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,655
- Did you like it?
- I loved it.

178
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,574
Phil thought it was flawed.

179
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,659
- How old is Phil again?
- You know how old he is. Why?

180
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,079
Well, your mother's friend Jeannette is
having an affair with a 19-year-old guy.

181
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,455
Mmm. Good for her. Yeah?

182
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:48,588
- Would Phil go out with Jeannette?
- I don't know.

183
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,919
You'd have to ask Phil.

184
00:14:53,226 --> 00:14:56,468
- Don't say anything about Jeannette.
- Who am I gonna tell?

185
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,222
- You and daddy fighting?
- No, it's not a fight.

186
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,766
Daddy doesn't look too happy.

187
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Mmm.

188
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,445
- Good night.
- Good night.

189
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Jesus.

190
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,035
You're like a five-year-old kid.

191
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,194
- I know, I know.
- It's wonderful when you're in the mood

192
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:29,925
and I'm in mood, but god!

193
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:34,134
It's not much fun when you
make me feel like it's an obligation.

194
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,090
I know. You're right. I'm sorry.

195
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,227
Besides, we had sex this morning.

196
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,313
What do you want?

197
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,019
Guess I'm not much fun to live with, am 1?

198
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,615
Are you okay?

199
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,235
I don't know.

200
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,539
What is it?

201
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:02,245
I don't know. I just -

202
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,376
I find myself -

203
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,923
I just -
I'm anxious all the time, you know.

204
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,052
About what?

205
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,758
I just - I'm fantasizing and -

206
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,808
- about what?
- Uh...

207
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,181
About changing my life.

208
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,315
Quit wall street.
Go be a disc jockey somewhere.

209
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:27,802
- I don't know.
- Tired of your job?

210
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:29,939
I'll tell you something.

211
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:32,067
I've been the takeover type all my life.

212
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:34,740
I mean, in school, in the Navy,

213
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,817
probably with you, certainly with Patti.

214
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,640
There's nothing wrong with
being a strong man.

215
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,825
That's the point. I'm not a strong man.

216
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,828
I don't feel like a strong man.
You are.

217
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,284
Well, I feel tired.

218
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know what to say.

219
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,378
You should see a psychiatrist. Really.

220
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,507
I don't think so.

221
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,924
Is it me? Are you tired of me?

222
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:05,895
I love you.

223
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,616
Aww.

224
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,159
I'd hate to join the crowd.

225
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,585
Why? What do you mean?

226
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,338
Well, Elaine's boozing a lot.

227
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,420
Jeannette's crazy.

228
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,004
Sue's okay. She's a strong woman. God.

229
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:39,923
Well, so are you.

230
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,766
I'm beginning to wonder about me.

231
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,805
It's so nice
to have a man to come home to.

232
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,685
On.

233
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,815
Is that just luck? Yeah.

234
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,109
It's luck and a fabulous body.

235
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,638
Jesus.

236
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,725
Here, three kids in the sixth grade
beat their teacher up.

237
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:32,819
Where?

238
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,197
Bronx.

239
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:39,444
You never have any trouble in school,
do you?

240
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,535
No.

241
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,994
It's a jungle.

242
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,080
It is. They got guys carrying guns.

243
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,291
Oh, you read too much.

244
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,003
- I what?
- It doesn't really happen that way.

245
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,546
It doesn't happen where you go to school,
'cause we got you in a pretty good school.

246
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,346
- It's costing me a lot of money.
- Oh. I'll go to public school.

247
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,514
- Okay. You're on.
- Okay.

248
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,513
You think that's funny?

249
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,515
We'll buy you a gun,
send you to public school.

250
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,312
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,338
I'm getting tickets to the ballet
a week from Friday. You want to go?

252
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,024
- I don't know. Let me ask Phil.
- Phil can come with us.

253
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,114
Only if he pays.

254
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:22,283
- I don't think Phil likes ballet.
- I don't either. I'm going.

255
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,655
Good for your soul.

256
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,411
No. I think I'll pass, mom.

257
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,788
Listen, am I a nagging father?

258
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,627
No. You're just feeling
the loss of separation.

259
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:38,708
I'm not your little girl anymore.

260
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:43,297
- Wash your mouth with soap.
- Hey, no physical contact, please.

261
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,714
Gotta go.

262
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:45,844
- Bye.
- Bye.

263
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:50,313
Bye.

264
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,310
Do you think daddy's worried
about getting old?

265
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,691
- Are you taking a psych course this year?
- Mm-hmm.

266
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,235
He's always joking. Never seems
to take anything seriously, you know.

267
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,162
You mean, he doesn't take Phil seriously.
That bothers you.

268
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,207
No, it doesn't.
I don't take Phil that seriously either.

269
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,409
I think you're serious about Phil.

270
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,002
Mom, I'm still a virgin,
if that's what you meant.

271
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,804
It's not what I meant.
I'm glad you told me.

272
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:29,099
- I just meant that you like Phil.
- I like Phil.

273
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,928
I'm not gonna marry him.
I'm never getting married.

274
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,607
- You will.
- Don't be so sure.

275
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:38,810
- Why not?
- Why should 1?

276
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:42,050
Everybody I know who's married is either
miserable or divorced. I don't want that.

277
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,874
Oh, Patti. That's ridiculous!
There's a lot of happily married couples.

278
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,910
Name three.

279
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:48,747
Uh - - uh.

280
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:52,199
- I'll have to think about it.
- Yeah. See you later.

281
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,291
383 west Broadway, please.

282
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,446
Now,
if all this stuff wasn't done by a woman,

283
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,477
I don't think you could sit
in the same room with it.

284
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,913
It isn't "stuff," Charlie.
It happens to be art.

285
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,120
You're a classic male chauvinist pig.

286
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,251
I know, but I'm cute.

287
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,422
You're out of style, Charlie.
“Want a bite?

288
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:47,055
Uh-uh.

289
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,134
You're a beautiful woman, Erica.

290
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:51,866
But you're leading such a sheltered life.

291
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,892
How can you tell?

292
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,971
It's in your eyes.

293
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,772
You can tell everything in a woman's eyes.

294
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,566
On.
Can you tell everything in a man's eyes?

295
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:05,192
Men cover it up.
Women lay it all on the line.

296
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,488
Right there in the old eyes.

297
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,858
What do you see in my eyes, Charlie?

298
00:22:15,209 --> 00:22:16,949
Want me to be honest? Yeah.

299
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,786
You're not gettin' enough.

300
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,871
I think you ought to have
your eyes examined.

301
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:25,583
Oh, no. No, you're not really satisfied.

302
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,548
I mean, your old man's okay and all that,

303
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:32,382
but, uh -
underneath it all, you're frustrated.

304
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,013
Go paint a still life, Charlie.

305
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:39,388
- You ever had an affair?
- It's none of your business.

306
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:42,646
Oh, man. What a shame. What a waste.

307
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,695
A woman as beautiful as you should
be tasting a little variety in life.

308
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,068
Imagine if all you ever ate was apples?

309
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,195
Imagine never tasting a peach or a pear?

310
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,368
A papaya?

311
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,242
Huh? No way, babe. Same thing with sex.

312
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,621
I'm allergic to papayas, Charlie.

313
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:05,631
How about a nice fresh guava? Huh?

314
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,881
- Huh?
- Leave me alone.

315
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:11,838
- Don't you ever think about anything else?
- Yeah, like what?

316
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:15,550
Oh, there's literature, and ballet,

317
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,747
- and theater, and dance -
- Hey, hey, hey, Erica, Erica...

318
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,602
- And architecture -
- Erica. Hey, listen.

319
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,306
There's work, there's food,
and there's sex.

320
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,397
That's the whole ball game.

321
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:28,031
Rowan gallery.

322
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,241
Yeah.

323
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,910
Sure.

324
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:36,071
Yeah. I'll meet you. Um, 15 minutes.

325
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:39,286
Okay, honey. Bye.

326
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:43,248
Might I inquire as to who "honey" is?

327
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:46,251
My husband. I'm meeting him for lunch.

328
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,138
Well...

329
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,910
Think I'll hit the streets for a while.

330
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,976
Bye, Charlie.

331
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,593
- Hi.
- Is this together?

332
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:01,519
Uh, yeah, he's paying for me.

333
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,938
That'll be $3.95.

334
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,489
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

335
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:26,798
Excuse me.

336
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,181
Mmm,
I wanted to talk to you about something.

337
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,302
I think that if we're gonna go
to the island this summer

338
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,083
that we really ought
to get on it right away.

339
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,723
How would you feel about
sharing a place with sue and Harold?

340
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:50,485
How's the market?

341
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:52,817
Huh?

342
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,983
Just wanted to see
if you're paying any attention to me.

343
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,339
You want to share a place
with sue and Harold.

344
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,206
Think you could handle it? Yeah.

345
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,874
Okay. Well,

346
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,546
I'll talk to sue, and maybe the four of us
could drive out in a couple of weeks.

347
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,623
We really should get on it right away.

348
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:14,673
Jesus, it's gonna be even more expensive
this year.

349
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:20,390
You know, if we do take a place,

350
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,934
we're gonna have to have my club up there.

351
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:27,140
I could just see us, all lying in the sun,
blabbing away.

352
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,816
I mean, we would - we talk. We really do.

353
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,940
I love our meetings.

354
00:25:34,742 --> 00:25:36,027
They're so -

355
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,072
I don't know. I just love them.

356
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,954
It's sort of like a continuing story,
you know.

357
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:45,784
It's, uh,
part Mary hartman and part ingmar bergman.

358
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:49,412
I - I love the women.

359
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,459
Marty.

360
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,296
Marty. Come on. What is it, honey?

361
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,096
What's the matter?

362
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,802
What is it?

363
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:10,938
- The - what? Tell me!
- I'm in love with somebody else.

364
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:17,778
I've been seeing another woman for...
Over a year.

365
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:22,487
At first, you know,
I thought it was just a - a fling.

366
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,742
But itisn't. I love her.

367
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,233
I want to live with her.

368
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,787
Oh, god. I don't want to hurt you.

369
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,296
I don't want to hurt Patti.

370
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,380
But I -

371
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,927
I can't -

372
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,636
you don't know her or anything.
Her name is marcia brenner.

373
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,560
She's a - she's a teacher.

374
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,729
She's, uh, 26.

375
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:52,559
I met her - I met her at bloomingdale's,
for chrissake!

376
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,899
I was standing there buying a shirt,
you know. And she, uh -

377
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:01,279
she was standing next to me.

378
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:02,826
She asked me, uh...

379
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,789
If I liked the shirt that, uh,
she was buying for her father.

380
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:12,244
Oh, god. I'm so sorry.

381
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:19,710
You tell Patti.
You tell Patti that you're sorry.

382
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:22,046
I'm in love with her.

383
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,305
Is she a good lay?

384
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,061
Aw, sh -

385
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,866
The first thing we have to do
is get you a good lawyer.

386
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,323
I just can't believe it.
I really liked Martin.

387
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,658
- This is not a time to pity Martin.
- I am not pitying Martin.

388
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,745
Move fast, Erica.
Don't let the thing drag on.

389
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,750
That's what I did.
It just hurts more and more.

390
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:22,958
- Get it over with.
- I don't agree with you.

391
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,668
There's nothing to talk about.

392
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,254
The son of a bitch walked out
on a magnificent woman.

393
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:30,011
The son of a bitch may walk
right back in in a month or two.

394
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,218
It sounds to me like
this thing's just sexual.

395
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,520
Would you take Harold back
if he told you he was having an affair?

396
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,895
Oh, hon, Harold has affairs.
He doesn't tell me about 'em.

397
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,235
I don't give a damn,
as long as we respect each other.

398
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,438
That's kind of a weird contradiction,
isn't it?

399
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,865
My marriage isn't based
on a king-size bed.

400
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:47,952
Neither was mine.

401
00:29:48,829 --> 00:29:52,287
I know it wasn't.
There was a lot of love there.

402
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:55,366
That's why I'd hate to see it wasted
if there's any hope.

403
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,996
There's no hope.

404
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,793
You want him back?

405
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,713
Would you take
that miserable bastard back?

406
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
No.

407
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,592
I don't think so.

408
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,137
"Think"? You have doubts?
Of course, she has doubts.

409
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:12,591
Look, all I know is I feel completely
and totally alone.

410
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,771
- That'll pass.
- Not if she sits on it, it won't.

411
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:20,395
Depression has a way of
getting nice and comfortable.

412
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,771
There are days
I really enjoy my black moods.

413
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:24,757
It's like curling up
with a good detective story.

414
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,781
Merde.

415
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,197
How would you know
if you were never there?

416
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:32,278
Hey, honey, these old bones
have known plenty of misery.

417
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:36,866
But I make it a point to get busy
as soon as I feel the blues coming on.

418
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,790
Oh, god.
It was so much easier in the '60s.

419
00:30:40,881 --> 00:30:44,373
We had Vietnam, assassinations,
the black panthers.

420
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,083
There was a hell of a lot to do.

421
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:49,386
Can't even find a decent cause these days.

422
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,264
I could use a good war.

423
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,809
I could use a double vodka Martini.

424
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,556
Patti's so sad.

425
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,347
She has a right to be. So do you.

426
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:04,234
I'm sad, Elaine.

427
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,445
I'm sad. I'm lonely. I'm depressed.

428
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,693
What do you want me to say?
What do you want me to say?

429
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:12,078
Where you goin'?

430
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,654
See you guys next week.

431
00:31:15,749 --> 00:31:17,535
Well, let me ride home with you.

432
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,209
- You sure you're all right?
- I'll call you later.

433
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:28,880
I think we made her feel worse
than she did.

434
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,845
I don't think that marriage is over yet.

435
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:35,765
I hope Martin gets a permanent case
of the clap and his pecker falls off.

436
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,641
- Hello.
- Fuck you.

437
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:02,000
I had a fight with Phil.

438
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,918
What about?

439
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,629
He was defending daddy.

440
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:14,801
He says he doesn't think it was the right
thing to do, but he understands him.

441
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,840
Phil's a nice boy.

442
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,394
I hate daddy.

443
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,469
He didn't leave you. He left me.

444
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,054
I still hate him.

445
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:25,766
You'll get over it.

446
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,774
I don't want to see him again.

447
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:37,406
Who are you talking about?
Phil or your daddy?

448
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:39,662
Both of them.

449
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,084
That's crazy.

450
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:46,332
Then I'm crazy.

451
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,375
Oh, honey.

452
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,089
Oh, mom.

453
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,015
I hate him, mom.

454
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,051
On.

455
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,103
I hate him too.

456
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:18,944
Would you take him back?

457
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,739
You want him to come back?

458
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,500
Yeah. I guess so.

459
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,006
It's over, kiddo.

460
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,877
For good.

461
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,585
You'd better get used to that, you know?

462
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,852
Hello?

463
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:46,482
Hello, Phil.

464
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,142
No.

465
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:58,450
Yes. Star wars. Mm-hmm.
No. Nothing. Nothing.

466
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,161
I thought we went over this.

467
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:06,082
Mm-hmm.

468
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,935
"Balls," said the queen.
"If I had 'em, I'd be king."

469
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,566
Well, if you won't sue me, Erica...

470
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,157
I'll tell you, uh, off the record,

471
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,359
that you're in very good health.

472
00:34:42,414 --> 00:34:45,531
- Why am I tired all the time?
- It's called divorce.

473
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:48,165
Maybe I should take valium or something.

474
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:50,369
Come on. We'll talk. Huh?

475
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,882
Did you feel this way, uh,
before all this happened?

476
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,964
- Never.
- Never?

477
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,970
Maybe I should see a psychiatrist, Arthur.

478
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:10,272
Erica, it's normal to feel lousy
when a husband walks out on you.

479
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,351
You'd have to be crazy to feel good.

480
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,981
It's only been a few weeks.
Some time has to pass.

481
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,138
And I'm not saying
you shouldn't see a psychiatrist.

482
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,322
You're just saying...

483
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,331
Erica's in good health.

484
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,368
Mmm.
Are you - are you seeing other men yet?

485
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,956
No!

486
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:34,504
Well, don't be so shocked.

487
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,041
I'm not in the mood for men, Arthur.

488
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,345
I wasn't referring to sex.
I mean, companionship.

489
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,548
Oh. On.

490
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:47,305
There are male companions out there
who don't wanna get laid?

491
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,011
Well, you could have a drink with me.

492
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,355
Is that a pass, Arthur?

493
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,252
No, it was an invitation to have a drink.

494
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,155
How come I never got an invitation
to have a drink when I was married?

495
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,279
Well, I don't know.
I - I never thought about it.

496
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:05,486
It's a pass, Arthur.

497
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,122
A definite fucking pass.

498
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,303
My relationship with hal
is totally honest.

499
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:16,872
He doesn't tell me he loves me.
I don't tell him he's fascinating.

500
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,638
- It's pure sex.
- You always were different.

501
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,472
Not always.

502
00:39:21,568 --> 00:39:23,448
I've just learned to live
with my ups and downs.

503
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,900
- I don't know how you do it.
- I like my job. I like my friends.

504
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:29,822
I like my holidays.

505
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:35,245
Oh, I'm going to the catskills next week.
There's a new swami in town. You wanna go?

506
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,124
Uh, well, my spiritual life is just fine.

507
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,330
What's spiritual?
There'll be some gorgeous men there.

508
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,254
- What does this Bob do?
- He's a press agent.

509
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:48,128
Broadway shows, movies.
Hal says he's a nice guy.

510
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,339
If he tries to touch me,
I'll break his arms.

511
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,504
Relax.

512
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,972
Waiter! Waiter! Right here, pal.

513
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,023
These are fantastic.
These are like claws, Bob.

514
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,066
- Oh, yeah?
- Claw things.

515
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:08,065
Oh, yeah.
We'll take all four of these.

516
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,760
- Don't know if I can eat 'em.
- What do you call these?

517
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:15,072
- Thank you.
- Claws. Claws. Erica, have a claw.

518
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:19,031
Unbelievable. Give her some of those, uh -

519
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,161
the shrimp with the, uh -

520
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,992
the shrimp with the white paper
on the end.

521
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,523
- What do you call that?
- Paper shrimp.

522
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,412
Paper shrimp. Give us some of those, okay?

523
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,715
- Okay, anything else?
- That's fine. Paper shrimp. Thank you.

524
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,085
Do you work, Erica?

525
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:35,672
Yeah, I, uh - I work part time.

526
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,507
The Rowan gallery in soho?

527
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:39,718
- Onh, I've never been there.
- It's a good gallery.

528
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,929
- We could all take a walk there later.
- That would be nice, yeah.

529
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:44,024
You paint?

530
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:48,351
No. I studied painting,
but I'm not an artist.

531
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,731
Mm-hmm.

532
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,813
I'm in public relations.

533
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,532
What are you working on?

534
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:58,612
Right now, it's a new picture
about an ex-Vietnam vet

535
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:03,416
who comes back to a small
midwestern town and shoots 300 people.

536
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,459
- That should make a fortune.
- I think I saw it.

537
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:08,580
- I don't think so, hal.
- I saw it, I'm telling you.

538
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:11,785
- You couldn't. They haven't made it yet.
- Sounds familiar.

539
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,091
Erica.

540
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,259
Claire.

541
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,590
- It's nice to see you.
- Remember Allison?

542
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:20,884
Hey.

543
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,598
How you doin'?

544
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:26,056
Hey, I called you about a hundred times.
Yeah.

545
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,141
- You never answer.
- I know. I know.

546
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:30,602
Oh, excuse me. This is, uh -

547
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:35,908
Bob. And this is Claire and Fred
and Allison and Elaine and hal.

548
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,076
- Hal. I'm hal.
- Fred. Nice to meet you.

549
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:40,641
- How are you? Glad to know you.
- Can we have lunch next week?

550
00:41:40,665 --> 00:41:42,496
- Yeah. I'll call you.
- Okay.

551
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,746
- I will.
- Want a bear claw, honey?

552
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,710
She's full.

553
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,162
I'm sorry, Erica.

554
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,377
- Call us if you need anything.
- I will. I thank you.

555
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,751
Please call me. Yeah. I will.

556
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,713
- Bye-bye.
- Nice to meet you. Take care.

557
00:41:57,807 --> 00:41:59,672
- Bye-bye.
- Hal, this is great.

558
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,438
Excuse me.

559
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,932
I'll be right back.

560
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,064
What are those things that would come
in this little steamer?

561
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,564
Waiter,
can we have a shrimp with paper?

562
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:17,148
Bring a couple of bubble-up.

563
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,828
You all right?

564
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:28,914
Yeah. I'm fine. You sure?

565
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,586
This is crazy.

566
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:34,298
- Erica, let's take a walk.
- I've been dim-sum-ed out of my mind.

567
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,501
I really think I'm gonna go home.
You sure”?

568
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,006
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take you home.

569
00:42:38,097 --> 00:42:39,962
- Stay a while.
- No, I really wanna go home.

570
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:42,286
- Where do you live?
- Go on, Elaine. I live in the east 60s.

571
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,846
- Good, I'll take you home.
- Bye.

572
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:46,477
Let me take you home.

573
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,350
- Bye-bye.
- I'll see you later. Call you.

574
00:42:48,441 --> 00:42:50,321
Have a nice time. See you.

575
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:55,858
- Boy, that's a nervous lady.
- She has a right to be.

576
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,284
I'm divorced.

577
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,584
Married 11 years. Two children.

578
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,710
My wife remarried.
She's living out on the island,

579
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:21,421
so, I get to see the kids
just about every weekend.

580
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:25,759
- When did you get divorced?
- It's been three years.

581
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,893
It was tough at first.
You feel very disoriented.

582
00:43:31,651 --> 00:43:32,651
I know.

583
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,981
Yeah, hal said you were separated.
What happened?

584
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,446
Oh...

585
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:42,859
My husband left me for a younger woman.
Ha, ha, ha.

586
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:45,578
He must be out of his mind.

587
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,546
- Are you uncomfortable?
- With you? No.

588
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,043
Why did you move closer to me?

589
00:43:58,511 --> 00:44:00,092
I don't know. I -

590
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,460
- I guess I want to be closer to you.
- Don't, Bob. Uh-uh.

591
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,347
Why not?

592
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,970
I said so, that's why.
I don't want you to.

593
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,177
- I didn't do anything.
- But you want to, don't you?

594
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:11,638
- You're paranoid.
- Do you, or don't you?

595
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,025
What?

596
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:16,943
You'd think I was asking
you to go to bed with me.

597
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,406
I'm just touchy these days. I'm sorry.

598
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:26,486
You sure are.

599
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:31,749
Maybe I am being less than honest. I -

600
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,293
- I'd like to see you again, Erica.
- Ah, I don't think so.

601
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:36,917
Why not?
You seem like a nice man.

602
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:40,125
It's not that. I'm just - I'm not dating.

603
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,676
- Well, what was today?
- Lunch.

604
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:47,928
Well, lunch is dating in my neighborhood.
Take a girl to lunch, it's dating.

605
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:56,269
Uh, you're right. Lunch is dating.

606
00:44:57,486 --> 00:45:01,650
Oh, god. "Dating..." It's a silly word.

607
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,742
You are a very complicated woman.

608
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:29,841
- I'm crazy about you.
- Stop!

609
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,222
You son of a - bitch!

610
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,804
Stop the cab! Stop it!

611
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:37,265
You - stop the cab!

612
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,691
- Sorry.
- Stop it!

613
00:45:38,778 --> 00:45:39,778
Sorry. I didn't -

614
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:42,023
- get out, you son of a bitch!
- I'm sorry.

615
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,550
- I didn't do anything!
- Just get out!

616
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,534
- What did I do?
- Just stop it! Will you stop it?

617
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,320
Just pull the fuck over!
Get out! I don't want to see you!

618
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:57,918
I didn't do anything. This is ridiculous.

619
00:45:58,005 --> 00:46:00,246
Just take me home.

620
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:13,055

628
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:40,245
Get out of here, Phil!
Just get out of my house!

629
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,400
- I'm sorry.
- Out of my house!

630
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:42,776
- I don't want to talk.
- What are you doing?

631
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,520
- You just get out!
- We didn't do anything!

632
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:45,862
- Here's your coat.
- Mom! No!

633
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,322
- You be quiet, Patti!
- No! He's not going!

634
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,506
Just get out of the door!

635
00:46:48,597 --> 00:46:50,367
- I want him to stay!
- Mrs. Benton - call you tomorrow!

636
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:51,756
- Patti!
- Mom, what is with you?

637
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:54,058
Look, you've got -
I don't care what you want!

638
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,761
- You can't run my life!
- Oh, goddamn it!

639
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,292
- I hate it here!
- This is our house!

640
00:46:58,316 --> 00:46:59,668
- I don't want to live here anymore!
- Brat!

641
00:46:59,692 --> 00:47:02,045
- I don't want to live here, either!
- You can't stop me from seeing Phil.

642
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:04,936
- I can stop you doing anything I want!
- No, you can't! I'll run away!

643
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,760
What did I do that was so wrong?
Tell me, and I'll understand.

644
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,929
I don't think you'd act like this
if your father lived here.

645
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,114
Act like what?
I wasn't having an orgy or anything!

646
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,820
- You want me to go to the park?
- Hush!

647
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:16,852
- I don't care if you go to the park!
- Okay, I'll go to the park!

648
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,603
- Get out of the house!
- I'll do it in public.

649
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:22,040
Okay, go ahead! I'd like to see you!
You might as well do it in public!

650
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:23,811
You don't have any feeling about anything!

651
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,876
Okay, fine! I'll do it!

652
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:34,511
- I don't know.
- God, what is with you?

653
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:36,471
I'm sorry.

654
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,562
God.

655
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:43,183
Oh, god.

656
00:47:44,737 --> 00:47:48,400
It's just confusing.
I - I'm sorry I screamed at you, Patti.

657
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,197
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

658
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:54,171
I just don't understand
why you get so upset.

659
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,954
- I just can't be your father.
- So just be my mother.

660
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,292
Come here.

661
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,211
Come here, honey.

662
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:20,224
Call Phil and tell him I'm sorry.

663
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:24,228
Uh - tell him he can come over.
We can have an orgy.

664
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,525
Maybe he's got a friend for me.

665
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,109
How was your date?

666
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,694
My date? Oh...

667
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:35,822
We had dim sum.
I was almost raped.

668
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:38,325
- He made a pass?
- Yeah.

669
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,706
I don't see what's wrong with that.

670
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:44,789
You're beginning to sound like my date.

671
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:51,171
You okay? Yeah. Fine.

672
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:53,878
How about you?

673
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,519
Call Phil.

674
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:01,896
Okay.

675
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:18,827
I'm - I'm afraid.
I'm frightened, you know.

676
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:21,576
- Mm-hmm.
- I've never been afraid of anything...

677
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:23,741
Before in my life.

678
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,626
When I was little, I was -

679
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,454
I don't know. I was afraid of -

680
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:33,922
that I was gonna get my clothes dirty,
or - you know,

681
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:37,972
that I was gonna
get bad marks on my report.

682
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,345
I was afraid when I got my period
for the first time.

683
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:48,858
You know, I -
well, I got my period when I was, uh -

684
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,776
when I was 13, you know.

685
00:49:51,864 --> 00:49:53,900
And most of my - well...

686
00:49:55,034 --> 00:50:00,199
Some of my friends -
well, my best friend -

687
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:04,790
my best friend was Karen fienstein,

688
00:50:04,877 --> 00:50:09,246
and she got her period when she was 12,
you know.

689
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:12,194
So, I thought there was something wrong
with me, because I didn't get my period.

690
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:16,962
So, I had a terrible year from 12 to 13.
You know, I mean, I -

691
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:19,468
I thought there was really
something wrong with me.

692
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:21,594
You know,
every time I went to the bathroom,

693
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,973
I would sort of, you know -
check and see if I -

694
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,555
- go look.
- Yeah. If I got my period.

695
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,890
And...

696
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:35,856
Suddenly, I - I was wearing these
dumb little white lace panties,

697
00:50:35,950 --> 00:50:38,817
you know, that my grandmother
had given me for my birthday or something.

698
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,617
And, um...

699
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,072
Suddenly I felt this, like,

700
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:49,160
wet, warm feeling in my crotch,
you know, and...

701
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:55,424
Then... I felt sort of... excited,
you know.

702
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,210
But then I felt afraid.

703
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:01,798
I was afraid. I was afraid

704
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:05,642
that was I going to get
blood all over the chair,

705
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,978
all over my pants.

706
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,983
Then the bell rang,
and then the class got up,

707
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:15,812
and then I saw Karen, you know.

708
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:19,990
And I smiled, and I winked at her, and I -
went like that.

709
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,035
And she came over.
She said, "what are you smiling about?"

710
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:26,865
And I said, "I think I got it."
She said, "oh, thank god."

711
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:35,956
I don't really know why
I'm telling you all this.

712
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,505
I mean, it doesn't really -

713
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:39,802
well...

714
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,339
Those are very scary moments, and -

715
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:47,097
and you think a lot about that
when you're a kid. It's natural.

716
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,928
And what's happening now?

717
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,350
Everything seems very different.
I'm - I'm not able to...

718
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,067
Know what's gonna happen.

719
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,020
You know, before I had a sense that...

720
00:51:59,158 --> 00:52:01,774
- Life would go on, and...
- Yes.

721
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:04,986
Now, it's like every day is like, "whew!"
Yeah.

722
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,040
What's gonna happen? And I don't know
how to control it, and I don't know -

723
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,834
- yeah.
- I don't know...

724
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,253
- I don't know what to do.
- Your whole life has been disrupted,

725
00:52:15,341 --> 00:52:16,706
discombobulated.

726
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,255
And it's a new life right now.

727
00:52:20,346 --> 00:52:25,215
I mean, what can you do? You know,
you can't live my life for me, can you?

728
00:52:25,309 --> 00:52:30,520
No. No. I certainly can't
live your life for you. It's your life.

729
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:36,063
But what I can do
is to explore it with you

730
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,485
and see what's happening now in your life.

731
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,572
Yeah.

732
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:45,201
Maybe the confusion
that you're feeling now will clear up.

733
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:47,038
I'm pretty sure it will.

734
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,157
I think right now would be
a really good idea

735
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,707
if you came twice a week.

736
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:55,661
But very quickly,
we'll move into once a week.

737
00:52:55,756 --> 00:53:00,466
Because it's a lot more important
what you do out there,

738
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,509
than what you do in here.

739
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,135
Mr. Benton would like
to meet at one 'o clock.

740
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,226
Hello, Mrs. Benton.

741
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:51,853
Hi.

742
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:57,223
It's good to see you. I'm glad you called.
Let me have your coat.

743
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:04,320
- You look terrific.
- I'm worried about Patti.

744
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,026
She's very angry at you.

745
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:14,206
Yeah. Well, she's got a right to be.

746
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:18,414
I'm seeing a therapist,
and I want her to see her too.

747
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,292
- It's expensive.
- That's all right.

748
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,170
- I'll - I'll take care of it.
- Good.

749
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:29,843
- Well, that's settled.
- Who's the - who's the therapist?

750
00:54:30,893 --> 00:54:34,135
Ah, her name is Tanya berkel.

751
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:37,562
- A woman?
- I don't know any men named Tanya.

752
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:41,767
Well, that's good.
I think that's - that's good.

753
00:54:41,862 --> 00:54:45,104
Good. I glad you think it's good.

754
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:49,637
You really hate me, don't you?

755
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,617
- Yeah.
- I don't hate you.

756
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:54,913
Oh, you were always
a very compassionate man, Martin.

757
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,410
Now, wait a minute. I -

758
00:54:56,502 --> 00:54:58,542
how can you hate somebody
that you were in love with

759
00:54:58,587 --> 00:55:00,067
- for 16 years? I don't -
- It's easy.

760
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,923
If you're trying to make me feel guiltier
than I already do, good job.

761
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,467
- Good.
- This is ridiculous.

762
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,865
Why are we having this conversation?

763
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:11,050
Martin,
do you know how many times we made love?

764
00:55:11,767 --> 00:55:13,928
- No.
- No, I don't want to get into that.

765
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,726
I wanna tell you. At least 2,000 times.

766
00:55:16,814 --> 00:55:20,898
That's counting twice a week for 16 years.
You should put it up on your ticker tape.

767
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,895
I think it's a very interesting statistic.

768
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,777
I wanna know something.

769
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:30,775
Did you fall out of love with my -
my flesh, my body...

770
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,704
Or me - with Erica?
Did you fall out of love with Erica?

771
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:38,874
Wait a minute.
I didn't fall out of love with you.

772
00:55:38,961 --> 00:55:40,292
I - I love you.

773
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,211
I mean, all right, it's different now,
but I -

774
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,919
I love you.
I can't just erase all those years.

775
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,628
- I'll always love you.
- I was your hooker, Martin.

776
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:55,224
I was a bright, high-priced,
classy hooker.

777
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,476
Upper East Side by way of vassar hooker,
but...

778
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:00,481
I was your hooker.

779
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,060
You have a lousy shrink.

780
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:07,482
How long do you think marcia's gonna last?

781
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:10,776
Well, I'm gonna marry her.

782
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:14,989
The awesome sanctity of marriage.

783
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:18,409
If you want to sit here with me
and have a conversation, that's great.

784
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,866
I'd like to do that.
But if you want to have an argument,

785
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:23,418
- I think you'd better leave.
- I want to have an argument!

786
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:25,708
You're flippin'.

787
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,085
Call Patti.

788
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:54,529
I never had any self-esteem.
That was the trouble.

789
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,028
I suppose I thought looks would do it.

790
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:01,581
Well, I'll tell you.
It is a nice feeling to like yourself.

791
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,750
Bette Davis always had self-esteem.

792
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:05,202
- On.
- So did Katharine hepburn.

793
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:06,878
- Mm-hmm.
- Terrific woman.

794
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:10,590
- Look at this.
- Oh.

795
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,713
- Beautiful.
- It's strange, isn't it?

796
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:16,888
I mean, where are all the wonderful women
that were in the movies in the old days?

797
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,600
Bette Davis, Katharine hepburn,
Joan Crawford.

798
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,555
- Where are all the women?
- Well, we've got, uh -

799
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,015
- Jane Fonda...
- Oh, please.

800
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:28,065
- Barbra Streisand.
- It's not the same thing.

801
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:31,065
I'd hate to see Fonda and Streisand

802
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:33,613
in a toe-to-toe with hepburn and Davis.
There's no contest.

803
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,031
- Different times.
- Hi.

804
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,153
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

805
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,951
- Hi. I'm sorry. Am I interrupting?
- No.

806
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,245
- Uh-uh.
- No.

807
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:42,539
We were wondering where all
the women movies stars are,

808
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,241
compared to 20, 30 years ago.

809
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:46,201
Well, um -

810
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,504
I think we're getting to an age where
the dominate cult figure is bisexual.

811
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,706
Oh, god.

812
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:53,793
Maybe unisexual would be
a more appropriate term.

813
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:56,253
You mean like Mick and Dylan and David?

814
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:57,988
- That sort of thing?
- Mm-hmm.

815
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,014
What's so funny?

816
00:58:00,978 --> 00:58:04,641
- Is that good or bad?
- I don't know. Nobody knows.

817
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:06,305
You're entitled to an opinion.

818
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,140
I'm not bisexual, if that's what you mean.

819
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,338
- Yes, we know that.
- You know, but maybe she doesn't.

820
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:13,570
How'd we get started on this?

821
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,522
Self-esteem.

822
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:19,568
I could write a book on self-esteem.

823
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,825
Self-esteem and the American woman.

824
00:58:24,543 --> 00:58:25,703
Once divorced.

825
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,998
Sleeping around.

826
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,546
Drinking too much.

827
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:35,091
Pretending to have a lot
of self- "you-know-what."

828
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,715
Really having next to none.

829
00:58:37,806 --> 00:58:40,843
- You getting your period, Elaine?
- Sure.

830
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,556
But I also have no fucking confidence.

831
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,248
Here. Drink this.

832
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:21,089
Why do people always
give you water when you fall apart?

833
00:59:21,141 --> 00:59:23,828
- I don't need water. I need booze.
- That's a girl.

834
00:59:23,852 --> 00:59:27,344
Don't worry, honey.
Aunt Elaine is just a manic-depressive.

835
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,605
You know, like, uh, Jekyll and Hyde?

836
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:34,276
I don't think you get enough vitamin c.

837
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,110
- See you guys later.
- Bye, honey.

838
00:59:40,202 --> 00:59:42,488
- Bye.
- Take care.

839
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,451
- She's somethin' else, Erica.
- Yeah, tough cookie.

840
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,578
- She's confused about Martin.
- How is the son of a bitch?

841
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:55,417
Hey. We forgot Claire Trevor.

842
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,591
Jean Arthur, Susan hayward.

843
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,258
What about Greta garbo?

844
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,589
That was before my time.

845
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:09,387
I liked Rita Hayworth. She was pretty.

846
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,733
Everywhere I go, I see, uh...

847
01:00:23,829 --> 01:00:24,829
Couples.

848
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:29,407
I see people holding hands,
or their arms around each other,

849
01:00:29,793 --> 01:00:32,250
cheek to cheek or -

850
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,750
I just feel jealous.

851
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:42,504
Oh, I have so much to say,
you know, at the end of the day.

852
01:00:44,766 --> 01:00:47,599
I tell Patti everything.

853
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:53,772
I think about her, you know,
going away to school and -

854
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:58,231
I know it's, uh -
it's a couple of years away,

855
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,232
but I think about it as if...

856
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:05,651
It's gonna happen, you know, tomorrow.

857
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:07,406
Yes. I'm...

858
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:12,912
I guess I'm lonely.

859
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:19,126
I was very lonely too when I got divorced.

860
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:22,338
- I didn't know you were divorced.
- Yes.

861
01:01:26,892 --> 01:01:29,258
And it's certainly okay to feel lonely.

862
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,185
You're supposed to
in a situation like this.

863
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,018
It's - it's what's expected.

864
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,693
It's really okay to feel anything.

865
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,573
Anger, jealousy.

866
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,655
Depression.

867
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,704
It's okay to feel.

868
01:01:56,338 --> 01:02:00,251
I - I feel guilty about my feelings.

869
01:02:03,178 --> 01:02:04,178
Well...

870
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:11,134
Guilt is something that I get livid about,
because it's kind of a man-made emotion.

871
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,010
And, uh...

872
01:02:17,025 --> 01:02:19,016
I would like to see you...

873
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,565
Take a vacation from guilt.

874
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:25,484
Stop feeling guilty for one week.

875
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:30,160
Just say, "Erica, turn off the guilt."

876
01:02:30,247 --> 01:02:33,284
Just turn it off. Don't feel guilty.

877
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:38,915
It doesn't get you anywhere.
It really prolongs the agony.

878
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,132
And...

879
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,219
I know what you mean. I'll try.
Yeah.

880
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,261
And don't feel guilty
about feeling guilty, either.

881
01:02:53,103 --> 01:02:57,392
And don't feel ashamed of your feelings.
They're your feelings. They have no 1q.

882
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:01,395
They have no morality.
They're your feelings. Just feel 'em.

883
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,569
When were you divorced?

884
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,030
I was divorced three years ago.

885
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:14,700
But let's get back to you and loneliness.

886
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,992
When you were married,
did you ever feel lonely?

887
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,361
- No, not really. No.
- In your marriage, did you feel lonely?

888
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,581
Never?

889
01:03:27,053 --> 01:03:29,965
No.

890
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:33,344
Well, sometimes, but I wasn't scared then,
you know?

891
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,520
This scares me. Yeah.

892
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:43,228
It is scary. It's a whole new way of life.

893
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:47,153
Did you ever find yourself
wanting to be alone?

894
01:03:47,741 --> 01:03:50,403
Yes.
But I knew it wasn't gonna be forever.

895
01:03:51,036 --> 01:03:55,245
Does it feel to you as if this is going
to be forever? The way you feel now?

896
01:04:01,588 --> 01:04:02,873
Well...

897
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:09,171
I haven't had sex for seven weeks.

898
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,471
It's been seven weeks since Martin left.

899
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,425
I always took sex for granted.

900
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:18,805
Are you feeling sexy these days?

901
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:21,639
Hardly.

902
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:26,688
And, uh -

903
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:39,330
- What was I saying?
- Sex.

904
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:44,957
Oh, yes.
I was hoping you'd forgotten. Um...

905
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:52,712
Well, we just had a pretty good sex life,
you know. I just...

906
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:57,550
It was very - this isn't fun.

907
01:04:57,644 --> 01:04:58,679
No.

908
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:00,135
I just...

909
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,643
- I enjoyed sex. It was -
- Mm-hmm.

910
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:10,650
It was nice. We were pretty... wild,
Martin and me.

911
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,355
Tell me what you mean by that.

912
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,611
What do you mean, you were pretty wild?
Well...

913
01:05:17,622 --> 01:05:19,362
We had a good sex life.

914
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,914
What exactly was it like?

915
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:25,038
Jesus! What do you think happened?
What happens?

916
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,336
You sound pretty angry.

917
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:31,009
What's that all about?

918
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,335
If I knew that,
I wouldn't be here.

919
01:05:49,988 --> 01:05:52,070
Well, what are you gonna do about it?

920
01:06:00,874 --> 01:06:03,490
You're looking at me
as if I have the answers.

921
01:06:05,170 --> 01:06:06,876
I don't have the answer for you.

922
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,632
I can tell you what I would do.

923
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:20,886
If I were me and I were in your situation.

924
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,064
What?

925
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:30,020
Well, one thing, I'd do a lot
of what you're doing already.

926
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,524
I'd be a -
I'd spend a lot of time with my friends.

927
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,074
As you're doing.

928
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:43,572
And I'd also sort of
take myself by the hand and say,

929
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:48,163
"come on, Tanya.
Get into the stream of life.

930
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:49,460
Get back in there.

931
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:52,876
Don't be scared of going out with guys.

932
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,551
Let's open the door and walk out
and get in the stream of life."

933
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,421
- Men, huh?
- Yeah, men.

934
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:02,845
I'd risk it.
I'd risk it with some new men.

935
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,140
They're people, you know.

936
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,347
I think you could enjoy them.

937
01:07:13,154 --> 01:07:17,614
- Take a chance.
- Yeah. I guess I should.

938
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:20,525
Ugh.

939
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:31,328

955
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:21,172
Erica.

956
01:08:22,890 --> 01:08:23,890
Hey.

957
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,099
- Come and join us.
- Okay.

958
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:30,223
J 'cause I don't wanna go home I

959
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,316
it's good to see you.

960
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:36,184
Erica Benton, Edward Thoreau.

961
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:38,065
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

962
01:08:38,156 --> 01:08:40,067
Erica works over at the Rowan.

963
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,149
Oh, really? I haven't seen the new show.

964
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:45,952
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.

965
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:49,998
Edward just got back from a year in Rome.
He's a painter.

966
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,745
How was Rome?

967
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:54,498
Oh, it's very controversial.
Either you love it or you hate it.

968
01:08:54,589 --> 01:08:56,170
I loved it. Yeah.

969
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,122
How are you, Erica?

970
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:01,459
Oh... I'm a little weird these days.

971
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,842
- I'm getting divorced.
- Ah, I'm surprised.

972
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:08,429
- Why?
- You seem like such a normal person.

973
01:09:08,519 --> 01:09:10,009
Compared to me, that is.

974
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:13,972
Normal people are getting divorced.
Nobody else bothers to get married.

975
01:09:14,067 --> 01:09:18,481
If I got married every time I thought
it was serious, I'd be in lots of trouble.

976
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,114
How are you?

977
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:25,909
The work I'm doing is nice.
Edward and I are definitely an item.

978
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:29,362
- So life is good.
- One hates to be thought of as an item.

979
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,625
Hey, what's happening, babe?

980
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,203
- Hi, Charlie.
- Hey, Charlie.

981
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:41,541
- Jean, how you doin'?
- Hi. My name is Edward Thoreau.

982
01:09:41,636 --> 01:09:43,968
- Charlie. Nice to see you.
- How do you do?

983
01:09:44,055 --> 01:09:47,422
- Were you slumming?
- I wasn't up till now.

984
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,553
What does she want from me?

985
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:53,307
There's a party at Tom whalen's loft.
Do you want to come?

986
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:56,310
Tom whalen?
You mean the guy who paints the turtles?

987
01:09:56,401 --> 01:09:59,734
- Yeah.
- I pass. Thanks.

988
01:09:59,821 --> 01:10:03,655
- Erica?
- I don't think so.

989
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:07,609
It was nice to meet you.
“Arriveder/a.

- Something to eat?
- Huh-huh.

1011
01:11:30,036 --> 01:11:33,028
- A bottle of chianti in the kitchen.
- Charlie, let's just do it, okay?

1012
01:11:33,414 --> 01:11:36,247
- Now, before I change my mind.
- Okay, okay.

1013
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:41,210
Let's just get something
straight right off the top, babe, huh?

1014
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,754
I don't get involved with my women.
I'm a short-term guy.

1015
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,051
I don't fall in love.
I don't wanna get married.

1016
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,138
Right.

1017
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:53,215
The only thing you can count on me for
is sex. I am what I am.

1018
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,391
- I make no bones about it.
- Charlie,

1019
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,558
I'm very nervous.

1020
01:11:56,646 --> 01:11:58,807
Your talking
is just making me more nervous.

1021
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:00,440
Okay.

1022
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,837
You're having trouble?

1023
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,351
Yeah.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1024
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,152
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1025
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:09,447
Here. Here. Wait. Hold it. Hold it.

1026
01:12:10,368 --> 01:12:13,826
- Just a second. You got your thing caught.
- My necklace is in it.

1027
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:14,993
All right, all right, wait.

1028
01:12:15,039 --> 01:12:17,121
Careful. There we go.

1029
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:20,120
Oh, what a disaster.

1030
01:12:20,211 --> 01:12:22,247
Cheer up, will you?

1031
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:27,085
Yeah. Aaah. The maiden.

1032
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:28,176
Delightful.

1033
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,127
Delightful.

1034
01:12:44,819 --> 01:12:46,229
Yo0-hoo? Miss?

1035
01:12:47,655 --> 01:12:48,655
Yo!

1036
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:55,109
Ah... here you are.

1037
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,497
Hi.

1038
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,701
Charlie,
I've only slept with one man, in 17 years.

1039
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:05,328
Jesus, I was wrong.

1040
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:09,207
I could've sworn you've had a few affairs.

1041
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,804
Oh, man, what a beautiful body.

1042
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:25,358
Come here.

1043
01:13:26,152 --> 01:13:27,938
Come here.

1044
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,894
Cheer up, will ya? This is your party.

1045
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,862
I'm a little embarrassed.

1046
01:13:40,291 --> 01:13:41,747
- When does she stop?
- Ow!

1047
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,790
What happened? An injury?

1048
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,082
- What's the matter?
- A splinter.

1049
01:13:47,173 --> 01:13:49,289
- Where?
- In my toe.

1050
01:13:50,343 --> 01:13:53,176
A splinter in the toe?
The foot doctor's here.

1051
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:55,844
Let me see. Let me see.

1052
01:13:57,016 --> 01:14:00,179
First,
we'll have to remove the outer garments.

1053
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:03,563
Oh, yes.

1054
01:14:06,150 --> 01:14:09,358
Ah... what a lovely piece of equipment.

1055
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,185
Hmm. Hmm.

1056
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,441
You like that, don't you?

1057
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,365
Huh...

1058
01:14:26,337 --> 01:14:28,544
You like that, huh?

1059
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:30,963
You like that, don't you?

1060
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:33,416
That's it.

1061
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:35,172
Yeah.

1062
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:37,931
Like it?

1063
01:14:39,725 --> 01:14:40,725
Huh-huh?

1064
01:14:42,603 --> 01:14:45,140
Your turn, baby. Hmm?
You gonna turn me on?

1065
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:44,742
- That was nice. Very nice.
- I have to go.

1066
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,915
- I'll see you tomorrow night, okay?
- No.

1067
01:15:49,211 --> 01:15:51,231
- What's the matter? You're mad at me?
- No.

1068
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:53,462
- Come back tomorrow night.
- Uh-uh.

1069
01:15:54,008 --> 01:15:55,214
Why not?

1070
01:15:56,010 --> 01:16:00,379
I don't fall in love, Charlie.
I'm a - I'm a short-term guy.

1071
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:06,139
I'll tell you one thing.
Your ex-old man is a fucking asshole.

1072
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:09,891
Good night, Charlie.

1073
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,276
Hi.

1074
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:45,365
Wait a minute. I want to talk to you.

1075
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,488
- Call me.
- Hey, come on.

1076
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,491
Hey,
you wanna give me a heart attack or what?

1077
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,870
God! Jesus, Martin! What do you want?

1078
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:56,957
Well, I just wanted to tell you that
I had a nice talk with Patti. She's okay.

1079
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,047
I know.

1080
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:00,506
How are you?

1081
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,092
I got laid last night.

1082
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,138
- Remember Billy Higgins?
- Uh-uh.

1083
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:11,467
Yeah, you do. He's that big, tall,
blond guy, worked for merrill lynch.

1084
01:18:11,562 --> 01:18:14,679
- Tennis player. About my age.
- Right, right. Yeah.

1085
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:16,668
He had a heart attack last week.
He dropped dead.

1086
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:17,898
That's too bad.

1087
01:18:19,445 --> 01:18:20,651
You look good.

1088
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,817
Would you try to have
a linear conversation, Martin?

1089
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:26,782
Look, wait a minute.
I just want us to be friends.

1090
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:28,860
I mean, if not for my sake,
then for Patti's.

1091
01:18:28,954 --> 01:18:32,037
- Li don't wanna be your friend.
- What the hell do you want me to do?

1092
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,455
Just leave me alone.

1093
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:39,795
Well, Billy was supposed to go out to la.
Now they want me to take his spot.

1094
01:18:40,507 --> 01:18:41,507
Take it.

1095
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,880
- It means I'd have to move out there.
- Good.

1096
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:45,970
If I do go out...

1097
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,088
Can Patti come out
and spend some time with me?

1098
01:18:49,183 --> 01:18:52,516
You'll have to ask Patti.

1099
01:19:20,130 --> 01:19:23,748
- Herbert, what do you think, hmm?
- Looks a little high on the right to me.

1100
01:19:25,719 --> 01:19:28,711
High on the right. Hmm.

1101
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:30,598
What do you think?

1102
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,637
I think the whole thing is too high.

1103
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,680
I like it where it is.

1104
01:19:39,525 --> 01:19:41,419
If you liked it where it is,
then why did you ask me?

1105
01:19:41,443 --> 01:19:43,399
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?

1106
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,618
Where would you like to go for dinner?
Hmm?

1107
01:20:00,713 --> 01:20:04,797
I can't, Saul. My daughter's coming home
from school. We're eating at home.

1108
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,499
- Give her a call. Tell her to join us.
- No!

1109
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,364
Well,
she doesn't have to know I'm your lover.

1110
01:20:09,388 --> 01:20:10,628
You're not my lover.

1111
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,882
Well, uh - you know what I mean.

1112
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:19,470
I'm not very good
at hiding my feelings, Saul.

1113
01:20:20,316 --> 01:20:21,316
What are your feelings?

1114
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:29,355
Well, I - I just slept with
a man that I barely know.

1115
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:32,237
- I mean, casual sex is not my -
- No, no.

1116
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:33,784
I don't - - no, it's not -

1117
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,195
I don't sleep with every woman I meet.

1118
01:20:36,290 --> 01:20:42,035
I'm experimenting. I'm -
well, I know it sounds a little cold.

1119
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:45,292
That's the way it is these days. I -

1120
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:50,259
I just wanna see how it feels to make love
to someone that I'm not in love with.

1121
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,803
How does it feel?

1122
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,005
Sort of empty.

1123
01:20:55,267 --> 01:20:56,632
Well, at least you're honest.

1124
01:20:56,727 --> 01:20:59,594
The sex was very good.
You're a very nice man.

1125
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,723
You have a bizarre way
of handing out a compliment.

1126
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:07,518
It's the best I can do.

1127
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:16,785
Why did you flirt with me at the gallery,
hmm?

1128
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:18,703
I think it was mutual.

1129
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:22,157
Ah, silly games we play.

1130
01:21:23,128 --> 01:21:25,289
There's no need for them, you know.

1131
01:21:25,923 --> 01:21:28,630
- Do you want to know how I really feel?
- Yes, I do.

1132
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:31,963
As soon as the sex was over,
I wanted to leave.

1133
01:21:32,471 --> 01:21:33,711
That's very hostile.

1134
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:37,048
I don't feel hostile. I like you.

1135
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:40,634
Perhaps you'd better go home.
I'm getting a very big headache.

1136
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:44,513
My husband used to get headaches
whenever I didn't want to have sex.

1137
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:47,941
Poor bugger must have had migraines.

1138
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:50,902
You got a coat? Yeah.

1139
01:22:13,887 --> 01:22:14,887
I'll see you later.

1140
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:29,562
- Behave yourselves, ladies.
- Oh, yeah?

1141
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:32,986
- We'll try.
- I'm always good.

1142
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:35,606
Just show me the bar.

1143
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,908
- Ah.
- That did it.

1144
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,910
I've gotta go home. I'm stoned.

1145
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,119
- Hello, Erica.
- Hi, Edward.

1146
01:22:50,632 --> 01:22:51,632
Nice to see you.

1147
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,585
These are my friends.
This is Elaine Liebowitz.

1148
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:56,990
- How do you do?
- Edward Thoreau.

1149
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:58,345
- And sue Miller.
- How do you do?

1150
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:00,593
- And Jeannette lewin.
- Nice to meet you.

1151
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,720
- Hi, Erica.
- Can I take your coats?

1152
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,052
- You look wonderful.
- Thanks.

1153
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:08,355
I'm Jean starret.
Erica has told me about your club.

1154
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:13,311
This is Jeannette and Elaine and sue.

1155
01:23:13,405 --> 01:23:14,405
Hmm-hmm. “What club?

1156
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,651
Do you know about consciousness raising?

1157
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:18,653
- Not really.
- Neither do we.

1158
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,156
We just kind of get together
once a week and complain a lot.

1159
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,361
That's very American.

1160
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:26,074
- Aren't you an American?
- I'm from Cleveland but try to forget it.

1161
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:29,001
- I was hoping you'd show up.
- How's your headache?

1162
01:23:30,255 --> 01:23:32,917
I had it ever since you left.

1163
01:23:35,511 --> 01:23:36,511
How's the party?

1164
01:23:38,597 --> 01:23:39,597
Usual.

1165
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:45,471
Well, whenever you put
about 50 artists together in one room,

1166
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,804
you get a really pleasant combination

1167
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,858
of gossip, paranoia, envy,
fear, trembling,

1168
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:57,947
hatred, lust and pretense.

1169
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,149
It's, uh, wonderful.

1170
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:07,410
- Tell me some good gossip.
- Good gossip, eh? Hmm.

1171
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:13,037
Oh. Here. You see the short,
wiry fellow in the corner?

1172
01:24:13,131 --> 01:24:14,792
The one with his arm around lady MacBeth?

1173
01:24:14,883 --> 01:24:18,375
Well, his name is Conrad zweiback.
He's Hungarian.

1174
01:24:18,470 --> 01:24:19,676
Very intense, very ambitious.

1175
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:23,088
Can't paint for shit.
'Who's the woman?

1176
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:26,641
Oh, she's the wife of Henry gebhart,
the critic.

1177
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:30,922
- Oh, I've never met him.
- Oh, he's a spider.

1178
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,940
Sets traps for young artists,
using his wife as bait.

1179
01:24:34,778 --> 01:24:38,521
- Is he gay?
- No. Not at all. That would make sense.

1180
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:41,986
No, it appears he likes to watch
his wife make love to other men.

1181
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:46,529
Now, if the other man
is pleasing to lady MacBeth,

1182
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:49,365
he becomes the new discovery of gebhart.

1183
01:24:49,459 --> 01:24:52,417
- How do you know all this?
- I was discovered by Henry gebhart.

1184
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:56,414
I'm kidding.

1185
01:24:56,508 --> 01:24:58,373
No, but it's true. The story's true.

1186
01:24:58,468 --> 01:25:01,301
- You're very beautiful tonight.
- You look very good yourself.

1187
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,215
Shall we dance?

1188
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,558
You're full of surprises.

1189
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,931
Remember, we don't really know each other.

1190
01:25:11,815 --> 01:25:13,430
- Tanya!
- Erica.

1191
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,107
- How great to see you here.
- God, what are you doing here?

1192
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:18,606
I'm an old friend of Jean starret's.
“Ah

1193
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:21,279
and I'd like to have you meet my friend,
Sophie windman.

1194
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:23,482
- Hello.
- Erica Benton.

1195
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:26,865
- Uh, this is Saul kaplan. Tanya berkel.
- Hi, Saul.

1196
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,536
- Hi. Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

1197
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:30,285
And we're looking around for Jean,

1198
01:25:30,375 --> 01:25:32,366
- so we'll go along.
- Ll think she's back there.

1199
01:25:32,461 --> 01:25:35,328
Okay, but I see something to eat in there,
so we'll go in there.

1200
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:37,754
- Okay.
- See you later. Have fun.

1201
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,301
Who was that woman?

1202
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,219
That was no woman. That was my therapist.

1203
01:25:51,938 --> 01:25:53,769
Having a good time? Yeah. You?

1204
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,269
- Hey, what do you say, baby?
- Charlie! God.

1205
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,442
You know each other? Yeah.

1206
01:25:58,528 --> 01:26:02,396
Charlie tells me he's a great artist.

1207
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:05,858
Uh, this is Elaine, and this is Jeannette.

1208
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:07,362
- Hello.
- This is Charlie.

1209
01:26:07,454 --> 01:26:09,695
- Hello.
- This is Saul kaplan.

1210
01:26:09,790 --> 01:26:12,372
Saul kaplan? 7he Saul kaplan?

1211
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,500
Oh, let me get over there.

1212
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:18,795
Hey, this is a real honor. I mean, really.

1213
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,214
Hey, I bow at your feet, man.

1214
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:25,253
This guy's a real fucking artist. Huh.

1215
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:28,134
Thank you. You may rise.

1216
01:26:28,225 --> 01:26:30,090
- Thank you.
- You're drunk, Charlie.

1217
01:26:30,519 --> 01:26:32,225
Yes, and stoned.

1218
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:35,520
Great combo.

1219
01:26:35,607 --> 01:26:37,167
Is he dangerous?

1220
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:39,065
Okay, ask her if I'm good, baby.

1221
01:26:39,152 --> 01:26:42,315
- Shut up, Charlie. Jesus!
- Oh, we really got it on one night.

1222
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:44,271
I mean, dynamite.

1223
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:48,405
And she slams the door in my face. I mean,
what did I do to deserve such a fate?

1224
01:26:48,495 --> 01:26:51,282
I balled my ass off;
The lady won't see me again.

1225
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,282
It's getting to be a '60's party.

1226
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,919
What, is it raining? What happened?
What happened?

1227
01:26:59,005 --> 01:27:01,417
- Why don't you go home, Charlie?
- Why don't you fuck off!

1228
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:03,419
- I'll wipe that floor with you.
- Up yours!

1229
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:07,628
- Come on. Let's leave.
- No, no. No. He leaves. We stay.

1230
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,298
Oh, I get it. You're ballin' her too.

1231
01:27:11,810 --> 01:27:14,392
You fucked-up pile of shit.

1232
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:44,081
I thought you were gonna kill him.

1233
01:27:44,176 --> 01:27:47,259
No, I wouldn't give the bastard
the satisfaction.

1234
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:51,801
If he made the front page
of the daily news, he'd end up famous.

1235
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:57,682
His work is good, actually.
I was surprised.

1236
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,806
Well,
you can be a bastard and have talent.

1237
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,192
Where'd you see his work, eh?

1238
01:28:05,822 --> 01:28:09,064
His place. You disappointed in me?

1239
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:14,490
I don't know you well enough
to be disappointed in you.

1240
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:18,782
But if you ever do it again,
I'll kill you.

1241
01:28:29,888 --> 01:28:30,923
Strange man.

1242
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:34,848
No, I'm a very simple man. Really.
Got very simple tastes.

1243
01:28:35,352 --> 01:28:38,344
I like titian, Rembrandt,
botticelli, Kojak,

1244
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,762
camembert cheese.

1245
01:28:41,900 --> 01:28:43,561
Expensive shoes. I have bad feet.

1246
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:48,149
London, Vermont, New York,
about half the time.

1247
01:28:48,615 --> 01:28:50,276
And being madly in love.

1248
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:53,780
And I've been without that
for a long time now.

1249
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:57,078
What's so funny, eh?
What the hell are you laughing at, eh?

1250
01:28:57,165 --> 01:28:59,165
I bare my soul, and you laugh at me.

1251
01:28:59,668 --> 01:29:01,249
'What is it? -

1252
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:03,292
you stepped in dog shit!

1253
01:29:07,425 --> 01:29:08,545
I think this is poodle shit.

1254
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,135
Yeah, after a while,
you can tell one kind from another.

1255
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:15,931
I can even tell the difference
between an east side dog,

1256
01:29:16,017 --> 01:29:18,383
an uptown dog and a village dog.

1257
01:29:18,478 --> 01:29:22,187
Now, east side dogs shit only the best,
and village dogs shit art.

1258
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,379
In London, they don't shit at all.
I don't think they're allowed to.

1259
01:29:26,403 --> 01:29:27,984
You know, in London,

1260
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:32,064
I think they have an underground
passage where all the dogs shit.

1261
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:36,280
I was born in London, you know.

1262
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,913
My father had a shop, near stepney green.

1263
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:42,992
That's the lower east side of London.

1264
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:49,332
One day when I was about six,
my parents had a row, you know.

1265
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:57,010
My mother, she threw a pickled herring
at my dad, and, uh, it missed.

1266
01:30:00,395 --> 01:30:02,602
Splattered all against the wall.

1267
01:30:03,148 --> 01:30:05,764
I took one look at the pickled herring,
and...

1268
01:30:08,778 --> 01:30:11,645
That's when I decided
to become an abstract expressionist.

1269
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:38,463
Your work does remind me
of pickled herring.

1270
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:41,727
Mmm.

1271
01:30:47,317 --> 01:30:48,317
Hey...

1272
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:52,190
I want to know about
that man you lived with, you know.

1273
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:53,986
Were you passionate with each other?

1274
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:57,066
- You mean sexually?
- I mean in every way.

1275
01:30:57,661 --> 01:31:01,199
Well,
we were married for a very long time.

1276
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,780
- I was married for nine years.
- Really?

1277
01:31:03,875 --> 01:31:06,457
Eight of those years were very passionate.

1278
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:09,126
Well,
"passion" is a mild word for it, really.

1279
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,704
It's - well, it was more like war.

1280
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:15,926
- How did your marriage end?
- Not with a whimper, but with a bang.

1281
01:31:16,012 --> 01:31:19,129
Matilda, her name is Matilda.

1282
01:31:19,557 --> 01:31:20,967
She wrote poetry for her soul,

1283
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:23,095
and she swam a hundred laps a day
for her body.

1284
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,598
Now this was after
we had the two children.

1285
01:31:25,689 --> 01:31:28,055
- Boys?
- My son is 12. My daughter is 9.

1286
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:30,766
Well, one day I came home, and I, uh -

1287
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:34,569
I found her in bed,
with a high diver from the local pool.

1288
01:31:34,656 --> 01:31:36,487
- Oh, god.
- I wanted to kill the poor sap,

1289
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,314
but something kept me from it.
“What?

1290
01:31:38,410 --> 01:31:40,947
He was about seven feet tall.

1291
01:31:42,831 --> 01:31:45,197
Oh, you know something? I...

1292
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:51,463
I wasn't angry.

1293
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:55,457
I felt relief, really.

1294
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:59,587
I was glad it was over. For both of us.

1295
01:31:59,681 --> 01:32:01,672
Well, I wasn't a very good husband.

1296
01:32:03,101 --> 01:32:05,092
My work means everything to me.

1297
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:09,763
I don't think I believe that.

1298
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:20,444
Don't you miss your children?

1299
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:23,701
- I love them. Sometimes I miss them.
- Mmm.

1300
01:32:26,624 --> 01:32:29,866
But I see them every summer. We have
a place up in Vermont. You'll like it.

1301
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,535
You seem to have my life
worked out for me.

1302
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:35,167
For us. I want you.

1303
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,916
- You know that?
- Yes, I'm getting the message.

1304
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:42,258
- Do you want me?
- My head tells me to slow down.

1305
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:48,469
But I don't think my pulse is normal.

1306
01:32:58,698 --> 01:33:01,690
You know, there are three things
that we could do right now.

1307
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,956
You could call a taxi and go home.

1308
01:33:19,052 --> 01:33:23,011
Or we could go on walking, and, uh,
I could lecture you

1309
01:33:23,098 --> 01:33:26,056
on the real dilemma of modern art.

1310
01:33:26,142 --> 01:33:29,009
Or we could go to my place,
and we could thoroughly enjoy each other.

1311
01:35:11,206 --> 01:35:14,198
J if we drift apart j

1312
01:35:14,292 --> 01:35:17,955

j I'm yours j

1327
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:07,477
You want hot sauce on your eggs?

1328
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:10,282
Please.

1329
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:12,899
- Grated cheese?
- Everything.

1330
01:37:27,884 --> 01:37:32,093
I feel great. I feel happy.

1331
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:34,592
I don't know what's going on.
This is craziness.

1332
01:37:37,143 --> 01:37:40,351
I don't understand anything anymore.

1333
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:45,891
I feel... I like to do things, you know.

1334
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,769
I want to travel. “We'll travel.

1335
01:37:50,573 --> 01:37:53,064
I want to see Greece.
I want to see persia.

1336
01:37:53,993 --> 01:37:55,358
I'd like to go to Tibet.

1337
01:37:55,995 --> 01:37:57,656
I'd like to open up a little restaurant.

1338
01:37:57,747 --> 01:38:02,161
Nothing fancy. Just a little something
where I sing, you know, under a spotlight.

1339
01:38:03,503 --> 01:38:05,289
You ever thought about skateboarding?

1340
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:10,965
I do want to go to India!

1341
01:38:13,137 --> 01:38:14,752
India I can do without.

1342
01:38:15,932 --> 01:38:16,932
Why?

1343
01:38:17,016 --> 01:38:18,472
I like a nice bathroom.

1344
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:28,517
I may go back to school.

1345
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:31,311
I may go back to school.

1346
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:35,152
What's wrong with the gallery?

1347
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:38,610
Oh, I need more money.
I don't want to depend on Martin forever.

1348
01:38:40,123 --> 01:38:43,411
Also,
I could use a real challenge in my work.

1349
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:48,249
Live with me. That'd be a real challenge.

1350
01:38:48,923 --> 01:38:51,539
I could use a challenge in my work.

1351
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:54,834
Living with me is work.

1352
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,507
Hey, this is really delicious.

1353
01:39:00,268 --> 01:39:01,268
I'm serious.

1354
01:39:03,813 --> 01:39:05,019
So am I.

1355
01:39:05,106 --> 01:39:06,106
Mmm!

1356
01:39:11,904 --> 01:39:16,898
- Does it still feel empty?
- No, but it tastes like hot sauce.

1357
01:39:27,336 --> 01:39:29,327
Why do you only have one child?

1358
01:39:29,672 --> 01:39:32,835
- Do you want to have a child?
- No, no, no, no.

1359
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:37,752
Well...
I had two miscarriages after Patti.

1360
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:40,508
I quit trying. Why?

1361
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:51,020
Because... I want to know everything
that there is to know about you.

1362
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:59,069
- Paint!
- Paint?

1363
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,446
Paint. Please, paint.

1364
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:02,572
Ah!

1365
01:40:02,997 --> 01:40:05,488
You are the most delicious woman
I've ever met!

1366
01:40:05,583 --> 01:40:07,039
I have to go.

1367
01:40:07,126 --> 01:40:09,788
There's something so damn
victorian about you!

1368
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:14,539
Will you ever, ever spend the whole day,
followed by the whole night,

1369
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:17,501
with me in this room?
I don't know!

1370
01:40:18,429 --> 01:40:20,511
Aaah!

1371
01:40:21,724 --> 01:40:24,056
Look, I'll come over to your place
if it's any easier.

1372
01:40:24,143 --> 01:40:26,805
There's just something
so nice about sleeping

1373
01:40:26,896 --> 01:40:29,729
and waking up with a person that you like.

1374
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,615
You really know how to rush a girl,
don't you?

1375
01:40:34,612 --> 01:40:40,528
Erica, underneath this haunted,
driven shell of a man,

1376
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:44,782
there lives a warm homebody
who likes to watch TV

1377
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:48,205
and chew cashews, while the woman he loves
is finishing a good novel.

1378
01:40:48,292 --> 01:40:50,283
Sounds like my marriage.

1379
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:01,544
I want to meet your daughter.

1380
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,129
Now? “Whenever.

1381
01:41:08,104 --> 01:41:10,095
Come to dinner tomorrow night.

1382
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:15,478
Don't know the address.

1383
01:41:41,387 --> 01:41:42,593
I like your style.

1384
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,750
A girl in my school
got an abortion last week.

1385
01:42:15,546 --> 01:42:17,537
- How old is she?
- Sixteen.

1386
01:42:19,050 --> 01:42:21,086
- It's not that unusual.
- Do I know her?

1387
01:42:21,177 --> 01:42:22,177
Mm-mm.

1388
01:42:22,887 --> 01:42:25,549
Cost 200 bucks. She said it was awful too.

1389
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:28,589
The doctor kissed her on the mouth,
right after the abortion.

1390
01:42:28,684 --> 01:42:30,640
- God!
- Two hundred bucks.

1391
01:42:31,354 --> 01:42:34,016
- What about her parents? Do they know?
- No way.

1392
01:42:34,523 --> 01:42:36,889
- Well, who paid for it?
- We all chipped in.

1393
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,311
- What about the boy?
- She was too embarrassed to ask him.

1394
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:45,906
That stinks.

1395
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,573
- Here comes Casanova.
- Oh, I'm warning you.

1396
01:42:50,373 --> 01:42:52,830
- I'm warning you.
- Shake it.

1397
01:42:58,214 --> 01:42:59,420
- Hello.
- Hi.

1398
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:13,426
- All right?
- Thank you. Yeah. Come in.

1399
01:43:18,359 --> 01:43:21,396
This is Patti Benton. Saul kaplan.

1400
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:23,235
- Hello.
- Hi.

1401
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:27,024
I saw one of your paintings
in the museum of modern art.

1402
01:43:27,076 --> 01:43:28,532
Oh? Did you like it?

1403
01:43:29,578 --> 01:43:30,784
Didn't understand it.

1404
01:43:31,205 --> 01:43:34,663
- Hmm. Well, I'm gonna like you.
- Never lies.

1405
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:36,626
How old are you?

1406
01:43:38,921 --> 01:43:40,331
Forty-two. You don't look it.

1407
01:43:40,965 --> 01:43:42,080
Ah... you look older.

1408
01:43:42,174 --> 01:43:43,209
Patti...

1409
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:46,594
How old do I look?

1410
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:48,590
I already know. You're 15.

1411
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:50,056
Mmm. Do I look it?

1412
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:52,802
You look much older.

1413
01:43:52,893 --> 01:43:54,884
Good.

1414
01:43:56,439 --> 01:43:58,555
Can I have some? With dinner.

1415
01:43:59,442 --> 01:44:01,603
Give her half a glass. Cut it with water.

1416
01:44:01,694 --> 01:44:04,481
Yeah, that's what the French do.
“We're not French.

1417
01:44:05,698 --> 01:44:06,904
Booze is worse than grass.

1418
01:44:08,826 --> 01:44:10,316
I smoke grass once in a while.

1419
01:44:10,828 --> 01:44:12,193
- So do I.
- Got any?

1420
01:44:13,456 --> 01:44:15,037
Now, don't be precocious, Patti.

1421
01:44:15,124 --> 01:44:19,083
I'm not being precocious.
I'm just a normal 15-year-old girl.

1422
01:44:20,713 --> 01:44:23,045
Actually, I'm not normal.
I'm still a virgin.

1423
01:44:23,674 --> 01:44:25,255
Patti, come into the kitchen with me.

1424
01:44:27,762 --> 01:44:28,877
Excuse us.

1425
01:44:33,642 --> 01:44:36,304
- You're being very rude.
- I guess I'm just nervous.

1426
01:44:36,395 --> 01:44:38,039
It's the first time
you've brought a man home.

1427
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:42,432
- Do you like him?
- It's too early to tell. He's cute.

1428
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:45,150
This is - this is really delicious.

1429
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:50,193
Your mother's a very good cook.

1430
01:44:50,284 --> 01:44:51,990
How can you tell from one dish?

1431
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:56,783
She made eggs for me the other night.

1432
01:44:56,874 --> 01:45:00,412
- Mmm. With hot sauce and grated cheese?
- That's right.

1433
01:45:00,503 --> 01:45:03,961
Mmm. She really likes you then.

1434
01:45:04,340 --> 01:45:06,797
I don't think I'm having fun
at this party.

1435
01:45:07,343 --> 01:45:09,755
- I am.
- Relax.

1436
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:14,380
I know that you and Saul are lovers.

1437
01:45:16,685 --> 01:45:17,891
It's not funny.

1438
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:23,768
What's the matter?
You always told me to tell the truth.

1439
01:45:25,277 --> 01:45:27,734
It's obvious that you invited
Saul here to prepare me.

1440
01:45:28,489 --> 01:45:29,569
Prepare you for what?

1441
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:33,987
Um, look,
I'm the one who asked to come here.

1442
01:45:34,078 --> 01:45:35,158
I wanted to meet you.

1443
01:45:35,246 --> 01:45:36,406
I have a father.

1444
01:45:42,545 --> 01:45:46,709
- I don't want to be your father.
- I'm not marrying Saul. I -

1445
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:48,539
- marry him! I don't care.
- He's my friend.

1446
01:45:48,634 --> 01:45:50,340
So, marry him. It doesn't matter to me.

1447
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:58,515
Nobody's asking you
to stop loving your father.

1448
01:45:59,854 --> 01:46:03,517
Well, you know, it would be easier
if daddy could see me here sometimes.

1449
01:46:08,863 --> 01:46:09,863
Okay.

1450
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:20,780
Sorry.

1451
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:23,491
I behaved like a 15-year-old.

1452
01:46:28,382 --> 01:46:29,588
I do it all the time.

1453
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:35,761
I maybe I'm a man
maybe I'm a lonely man &

1454
01:46:35,848 --> 01:46:40,683

01:46:48,444 --> 01:46:50,480
j baby, won't you help me understand j

1458
01:46:53,616 --> 01:46:57,734
j; Maybe I'm amazed at the way
you're with me all the time &

1459
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:02,071
I maybe I'm afraid
of the way I need you &

1460
01:47:03,918 --> 01:47:08,036
j; Maybe I'm amazed at the way
you help me sing my song j

1461
01:47:08,464 --> 01:47:11,046
j you right me when I'm wrong &

1462
01:47:11,133 --> 01:47:14,170

1463

01:47:27,566 --> 01:47:28,931

01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,691
j baby, won't you help me un - I

1468
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:55,249
Good morning.

1469
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:59,087
- Hi. How come you're not jogging?
- I had an early appointment with this guy.

1470
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,591
- Aaah.
- What's, uh - what's up?

1471
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:04,349
Well, I've decided that
you can come to the apartment,

1472
01:48:04,436 --> 01:48:06,472
you know,
to see Patti whenever you want.

1473
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:09,100
- Oh, good. I'm glad.
- Just call first.

1474
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:12,649
Sure. Oh, I meant to tell you.
I'm not going to California now.

1475
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:15,853
- Why?
- Oh, lot of things. Mostly, no money.

1476
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:19,281
Well, you know, I've, uh -
I've stopped seeing my therapist,

1477
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:22,280
and, uh, well,
I'm looking around for a better job, so,

1478
01:48:23,205 --> 01:48:25,161
the money thing will be
a lot easier for you.

1479
01:48:25,791 --> 01:48:27,471
We could make it real easy if you want to.

1480
01:48:27,960 --> 01:48:29,166
What do you mean?

1481
01:48:30,087 --> 01:48:31,293
I broke up with marcia.

1482
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:34,841
I'm surprised.

1483
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:37,466
Yeah, I am too, kind of -

1484
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,678
well, truth of it is she left me.

1485
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:45,891
I don't know. I mean, the minute
I moved in there, we stopped having fun.

1486
01:48:48,313 --> 01:48:49,519
It's craziness.

1487
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:52,692
I'm sorry.

1488
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:55,987
Are you really?

1489
01:48:56,071 --> 01:48:58,483
Yeah, I'm sorry for you.

1490
01:48:59,074 --> 01:49:01,065
- I want to come back.
- No.

1491
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:02,692
Will you think about it?

1492
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:06,080
No, Martin.

1493
01:49:08,542 --> 01:49:13,252
I mean - I was thinking
you could think of me

1494
01:49:13,338 --> 01:49:18,002
as this guy who was sick for a long time,
you know, and then recovered.

1495
01:49:18,552 --> 01:49:19,552
Think you could do that?

1496
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:24,550
It doesn't work that way, you know?

1497
01:49:28,937 --> 01:49:32,395
Yeah. Patti said you have a boyfriend.

1498
01:49:32,941 --> 01:49:35,478
Yeah. We're going steady.

1499
01:49:40,574 --> 01:49:41,814
Well, I'll call you.

1500
01:49:42,910 --> 01:49:44,571
Yes. Bye.

1501
01:49:45,579 --> 01:49:46,579
Bye, Martin.

1502
01:50:05,390 --> 01:50:07,597
Patti's gonna have to spend
more time alone.

1503
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:10,558
Oh, she can cope with that.
Yeah.

1504
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:14,433
I don't know. I worry about her.

1505
01:50:15,567 --> 01:50:17,148
I have to. I have to.

1506
01:50:17,736 --> 01:50:20,603
- You don't have to.
- I do.

1507
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:22,859
I have enough money for both of us.

1508
01:50:24,118 --> 01:50:25,608
I don't want your money, Saul.

1509
01:50:26,703 --> 01:50:30,662
Look, I'd take your money,
if I needed it, and if you had it.

1510
01:50:31,166 --> 01:50:34,124
What about you? You're an artist.

1511
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:35,872
Oh, yes.

1512
01:50:39,466 --> 01:50:43,584
- What's Patti doing this summer?
- Oh, she wants to go to summer school.

1513
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,407
Well, you know what would be nice?
What would be very nice indeed, would be

1514
01:50:46,431 --> 01:50:47,762
if -

1515
01:50:48,392 --> 01:50:52,135
both of you came up to Vermont,
for the whole of the summer.

1516
01:50:52,938 --> 01:50:54,428
I can't leave the gallery.

1517
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:58,273
I can't.

1518
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,770
He'd let you go for the summer.

1519
01:50:59,862 --> 01:51:02,774
Well, maybe for a week,
but not for the whole summer.

1520
01:51:04,241 --> 01:51:06,072
- Very beautiful.
- Oh.

1521
01:51:09,496 --> 01:51:10,496
Want one?

1522
01:51:11,415 --> 01:51:12,415
Yes, sir.

1523
01:51:12,499 --> 01:51:14,911
- Oh, um, one lemon, please.
- Two.

1524
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:17,118
- I'm sorry. No lemon. Vanilla.
- Oh.

1525
01:51:17,212 --> 01:51:18,952
- Okay. That's all right.
- Fine. Good.

1526
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:21,880
- Your children will be there, won't they?
- Yes, they certainly will.

1527
01:51:22,384 --> 01:51:24,466
Yes. Well, we'd have a lot of fun.

1528
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:25,668
- Madame.
- Fine.

1529
01:51:26,722 --> 01:51:27,722
I can't.

1530
01:51:28,891 --> 01:51:30,722
You keep saying you can't.

1531
01:51:31,643 --> 01:51:33,496
- How much are these, please?
- Twenty cents each, please.

1532
01:51:33,520 --> 01:51:36,728
Twenty cents each. "I can't.”

1533
01:51:36,815 --> 01:51:39,015
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Well, I can't.

1534
01:51:39,067 --> 01:51:40,067
Okay.

1535
01:51:40,736 --> 01:51:43,569
What am I gonna do up there?

1536
01:51:44,114 --> 01:51:50,201
- Watch you paint? Go fishing? Go swimming?
- Well, it sounds nice, doesn't it?

1537
01:51:50,871 --> 01:51:53,487
Ah... yeah.

1538
01:51:54,416 --> 01:51:56,122
I'll come up for a couple of weekends.

1539
01:51:58,921 --> 01:52:00,627
Life is very complicated.

1540
01:52:01,882 --> 01:52:06,626
I've been on vacation for 16 years.

1541
01:52:08,805 --> 01:52:11,763
Oh, look, listen.
I-l know you want to get out on your own.

1542
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:16,434
- I approve. I wouldn't try to stop you.
- What do you mean, you approve?

1543
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:18,227
- What?
- I don't understand that word.

1544
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:20,043
- Why are you saying you approve?
- Oh, look.

1545
01:52:20,067 --> 01:52:21,836
- I'm not doing this for your approval.
- No, no, listen.

1546
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:25,273
- Let me finish. Please.
- No, that's not what I have on my mind.

1547
01:52:25,364 --> 01:52:28,948
I hate that.
Yes. All I meant was that if -

1548
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:32,305
well, spending a few weeks with someone
you like, that's not out of line.

1549
01:52:32,329 --> 01:52:34,285
How do you know? How can you say that?

1550
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:36,659
How do you know what I need,
what I want to do for myself?

1551
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:41,209
I think we need a marriage counselor.

1552
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:46,672
Why don't you come back here
every weekend?

1553
01:52:47,177 --> 01:52:49,293
Because if I stop painting for a few days,

1554
01:52:49,972 --> 01:52:51,257
I may stop painting altogether.

1555
01:53:01,566 --> 01:53:05,229
- Do you really believe that?
- Absolutely.

1556
01:53:11,410 --> 01:53:12,410
Men.

1557
01:53:13,954 --> 01:53:14,954
Women.

1558
01:53:42,733 --> 01:53:44,098
You know what I did yesterday?

1559
01:53:45,319 --> 01:53:48,186
I threw out a whole new
jar of BlackBerry jam.

1560
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:50,521
Martin loved BlackBerry jam. Ugh.

1561
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:58,404
I think the problem was that
I didn't do things as myself, you know.

1562
01:53:58,498 --> 01:53:59,704
I did things as this -

1563
01:54:01,585 --> 01:54:07,626
Martin and Erica, Martin and Erica.
It wasn't his fault. I - I liked it.

1564
01:54:09,468 --> 01:54:12,175
Saul and Erica will be different
from Martin and Erica.

1565
01:54:14,931 --> 01:54:18,048
- You want to see other women?
- I want you.

1566
01:54:18,518 --> 01:54:20,304
- You're free to.
- I don't want to.

1567
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:21,395
Then don't.

1568
01:54:23,899 --> 01:54:25,059
Do you want to see other men?

1569
01:54:26,026 --> 01:54:27,026
Not today.

1570
01:54:28,487 --> 01:54:29,602
I'm getting a headache.

1571
01:54:34,201 --> 01:54:35,441
I have to go back to work.

1572
01:54:37,496 --> 01:54:38,496
So dol.

1573
01:54:54,846 --> 01:54:57,633
- Would you rather go back to bed?
- Mm-hmm.

1574
01:54:59,142 --> 01:55:01,133
Yes?

1575
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,666
This thing needs oil.

1576
01:55:40,600 --> 01:55:44,058
See, I want to put those pillows,
you know, from the sofa around there.

1577
01:55:44,146 --> 01:55:45,556
- Mm-hmm.
- Carpet.

1578
01:55:49,067 --> 01:55:52,400
- Has a lot of outlets.
- Yeah, a lot of outlets.

1579
01:55:55,031 --> 01:55:57,989
- Ta-da!
- Another fireplace?

1580
01:56:00,328 --> 01:56:01,534
It's nice, isn't it?

1581
01:56:02,330 --> 01:56:04,321
- I can afford it.
- Then take it.

1582
01:56:04,416 --> 01:56:06,873
I don't know what to do with Saul,
you know.

1583
01:56:08,003 --> 01:56:11,040
He wants me to go to Vermont.
He goes there for five months!

1584
01:56:11,715 --> 01:56:14,001
- Then don't take it.
- You're a lot of help.

1585
01:56:14,759 --> 01:56:16,545
Why don't I go to Vermont?

1586
01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:20,671
You stay here, work your ass off,
and be sensible.

1587
01:56:21,224 --> 01:56:24,136
I'll go pick berries
and dance in the woods with Saul.

1588
01:56:24,227 --> 01:56:25,467
It's confusing, Elaine.

1589
01:56:26,354 --> 01:56:27,915
You know, since I started taking lithium,

1590
01:56:27,939 --> 01:56:30,806
I feel more sensible than
this month's good housekeeping.

1591
01:56:31,318 --> 01:56:35,482
No more black, moody lows.
But I sure as hell miss my highs.

1592
01:56:53,840 --> 01:56:55,455
You want my advice? Yeah.

1593
01:56:55,550 --> 01:56:59,919
Do you know how rare a man like Saul is?
You know how many jerks are out there?

1594
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:03,547
He's smart. He's funny.

1595
01:57:05,769 --> 01:57:08,181
- Is he a good lover?
- Eh.

1596
01:57:10,815 --> 01:57:13,682
Start packing, honey.

1597
01:57:16,821 --> 01:57:19,278
I finally settled down.

1598
01:57:19,366 --> 01:57:21,357
I gotta tell you this.

1599
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:26,662
- Oh, it's crazy.
- It's okay. It's really okay.

1600
01:57:39,427 --> 01:57:40,758
You're looking very beautiful.

1601
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:45,088
You're traveling awfully light.

1602
01:58:05,704 --> 01:58:07,490
How do you pack pickled herring?

1603
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:10,284
I'll definitely come up for holidays.

1604
01:58:15,130 --> 01:58:18,964
You know what it's like
up there in the woods all alone?

1605
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:21,336
- Paint.
- Hmm.

1606
01:58:24,848 --> 01:58:27,305
Perhaps I'll find some nice,
warm moose to keep me company.

1607
01:58:27,726 --> 01:58:29,557
Am I only a sexual object to you?

1608
01:58:32,772 --> 01:58:33,978
No.

1609
01:58:35,108 --> 01:58:39,317
No, you're a bright, willful,
curious woman...

1610
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:43,730
Who is also a sexual object.

1611
01:58:48,330 --> 01:58:54,326
I hope it's the hottest, muggiest,
most miserable summer on record.

1612
01:58:55,086 --> 01:59:00,171
- You're so damn stubborn.
- I'm not. I'm really not.

1613
01:59:00,634 --> 01:59:03,501
Come with me, for chrissake!

1614
01:59:07,932 --> 01:59:08,932
I can't.

1615
01:59:12,937 --> 01:59:16,270
- Independent.
- Trying to be.

1616
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:20,267
- Woman.
- Yeah.

1617
01:59:23,907 --> 01:59:26,774
- Vicious.
- No.

1618
01:59:26,868 --> 01:59:27,868
Honest.

1619
01:59:30,038 --> 01:59:31,153
You're driving me crazy.

1620
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:18,617
Okay, Mario, I've got it!

1621
02:00:29,597 --> 02:00:31,508
Will you hold this a minute?
Yeah.

1622
02:00:41,985 --> 02:00:43,395
- Have you got it?
- I got it.

1623
02:00:54,164 --> 02:00:56,405
Bye. “What about this?

1624
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,035
Oh, that's for you.

1625
02:00:58,126 --> 02:01:00,333
How the hell am I gonna get it home?

1626
02:01:02,130 --> 02:01:03,130
Take a taxi.
