1
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,755
- What do you got?
- Man with a little rabbit in him.

2
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:10,132
Throw him on.

3
00:02:10,465 --> 00:02:14,470
- Those guys with the guns.
- Convicts.

4
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:18,433
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Wakefield prisoners.

5
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,268
Same as us.

6
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:34,826
He's not gonna make it.

7
00:02:37,913 --> 00:02:40,874
Take these boys on back.
I'll talk to you later.

8
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:46,130
One of you cons trying for parole?

9
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:13,201
Come on. Up. Up.

10
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,038
You guys hit bottom.

11
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:27,050
Here you go.

12
00:04:01,254 --> 00:04:03,089
In there.

13
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:09,680
Follow me.

14
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:15,352
In there.

15
00:04:33,414 --> 00:04:35,499
That's it for you.

16
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:39,170
Okay, next man.

17
00:04:45,886 --> 00:04:48,221
Let's just take a little off
around the ears.

18
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,600
Cost five to get you no haircut, Zaranska.

19
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:55,521
- Two only gets you a crew cut.
- I'll tell you when. You.

20
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,691
Fuck it, I can use this on a bed.

21
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:02,947
It'll all come off then.
Maybe an ear with it.

22
00:05:03,197 --> 00:05:05,866
Hey, man, what happened
to that guy on the bus?

23
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:10,037
You don't talk to me unless I tell you to.

24
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:11,790
You hear?

25
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,667
Yeah.

26
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:21,550
What's it be, my man?

27
00:05:22,718 --> 00:05:24,136
Leave the ears.

28
00:05:24,303 --> 00:05:27,014
I'm getting ready to come on in.

29
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:44,367
Fresh meat coming in.

30
00:05:56,338 --> 00:05:59,550
Where in the hell's Lamar at?
He don't have the job no more?

31
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:03,512
What's it look like?
I'm the man in here.

32
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:08,560
Come on, I'll show you where you sleep.

33
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,980
Rest of you men, grab a blanket,
find some room on the floor.

34
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:15,234
We talk about beds
when somebody gets out of here or dies.

35
00:06:18,613 --> 00:06:20,448
- Come here.
- Move it down.

36
00:06:20,615 --> 00:06:22,867
Let's go, every other one.

37
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:26,330
Come on down here.

38
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:29,291
Let's go, move it on down.

39
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,336
- What the hell you looking at?
- Move on down there.

40
00:06:46,977 --> 00:06:49,063
Come on, let's go.

41
00:06:50,147 --> 00:06:52,191
Come on, move it down.

42
00:06:57,906 --> 00:07:00,367
Come on, move it on down.

43
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:04,788
Fucking showers.

44
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:08,709
These goddamn showers ain't got
no hot water.

45
00:07:10,544 --> 00:07:13,089
Let me go! No!

46
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,860
You're over there, buddy.
Eat all that.

47
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:04,895
Come on, boy. What is the matter?
You playing hard to get?

48
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,939
Let go.

49
00:08:11,653 --> 00:08:13,530
No, stop it.

50
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,409
Get your own soap, you understand?

51
00:08:35,387 --> 00:08:37,222
Mr. Caldwell.

52
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:46,399
Lord, you're getting fat, aren't you?

53
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:48,401
Stay out of my face, motherfucker.

54
00:08:48,568 --> 00:08:50,779
- Hey, Huey.
- Floyd.

55
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,743
Hey, Huey, how's about that game?

56
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:02,083
I'm getting ready to be angry, Abraham.
I'm getting ready to be real angry.

57
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,646
<i>Oh, look at her go.</i>

58
00:09:21,813 --> 00:09:24,566
<i>Yeah, she goes up on the inside.</i>

59
00:09:25,109 --> 00:09:26,902
<i>She's still behind her.</i>

60
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:31,824
<i>And look out.
She threw a left hand at her. Back again.</i>

61
00:09:31,991 --> 00:09:34,953
<i>Tried to lift the bigger gal off her feet.</i>

62
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,044
I'm going up to the house.
New people came in today.

63
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,132
I think they need to go to school,
so run upstairs...

64
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:48,301
and show them what the picture is.

65
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,636
When this is over.

66
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:53,931
Now, Eddie.

67
00:09:54,098 --> 00:09:56,226
Where's my boots?

68
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:00,564
<i>And she scores two points.
That makes 40.</i>

69
00:10:00,731 --> 00:10:02,107
Walter.

70
00:10:02,274 --> 00:10:04,484
Coming in, Otis.

71
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,364
Man gonna ride the hide, Otis.

72
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:36,144
Hey, man, I told you
I ain't have no match, man.

73
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:42,026
Spivey, they want you down
at the bars, boy.

74
00:10:42,193 --> 00:10:45,154
- Down at the bars, captain?
- You heard me. Now move.

75
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:47,573
- The bars?
- Goddamn it, I said move!

76
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,577
I ain't got all fucking night!
Now move!

77
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:54,164
Why the bars, captain?
I didn't do nothing.

78
00:10:55,123 --> 00:10:57,376
I didn't do nothing, captain.

79
00:11:01,172 --> 00:11:03,257
I didn't do nothing.

80
00:11:12,226 --> 00:11:14,937
Now drop them pants and get on that gate.

81
00:11:15,104 --> 00:11:17,273
But I didn't do nothing.

82
00:11:20,986 --> 00:11:23,446
I didn't do nothing.

83
00:11:26,032 --> 00:11:27,617
Damn.

84
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,163
- How many licks you recollect that is?
- That's three.

85
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:32,790
- Three what?
- Three, cap.

86
00:11:32,957 --> 00:11:34,417
- And what's that?!
- Four, cap!

87
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,127
- And what's that?!
- Five!

88
00:11:36,294 --> 00:11:39,839
- Can't hear you!
- Six, cap! Seven, cap!

89
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:42,592
Eight, cap! Nine, cap!

90
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:45,971
That's 10, cap! Eleven, cap!

91
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:49,141
That's 12, cap!

92
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:56,274
- Hang him up.
- Open the gate, Otis.

93
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:58,735
What the hell are you looking at?

94
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:18,590
Pick it up.

95
00:12:18,757 --> 00:12:21,051
Pick it up. Pick it up.

96
00:12:23,136 --> 00:12:26,015
- Moving out.
- Move out.

97
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:54,003
Let's see you swing them hoes.

98
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:02,137
All right, you boys, swing them hoes.

99
00:13:03,305 --> 00:13:05,391
Now get in between.

100
00:13:15,151 --> 00:13:17,989
You coming down to the office today,
Captain Renfro?

101
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:21,617
Because I wrote them letters like you wanted.
Maybe you wanna look at them.

102
00:13:21,784 --> 00:13:23,953
What are we gonna do about my brother?

103
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,541
Give your brother a call.
Tell him I'll send ten boys over.

104
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:31,169
Wash out his milk machinery on Tuesday.

105
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:19,765
Get yourself cleaned up, boy.

106
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:58,640
- Hey, baby.
- You coming to see me tonight, sweetie?

107
00:14:58,807 --> 00:15:00,892
I think he's blushing.

108
00:15:05,314 --> 00:15:07,483
- Why, you....
- Beat him up, J.B.

109
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:11,153
Sucker, you're in trouble, you know that?
You're in trouble.

110
00:15:11,904 --> 00:15:14,366
Beat him up, J.B. Beat him up.

111
00:15:19,162 --> 00:15:21,331
What's going on over here?!

112
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:27,422
Bullen, Elwood, over here.
Come on, come on.

113
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:30,925
You're fixing to get yourself
over to Camp Five.

114
00:15:31,092 --> 00:15:33,762
- Thanks, man.
- You're the dumbest asshole yet.

115
00:15:33,929 --> 00:15:37,266
- Ain't you got enough shit on you?
- Put him down on the ground.

116
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:39,268
Do it, Bullen.

117
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:42,187
Now put the gun on him. Do it, boy.

118
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:50,613
- Get him down and hold him down.
- That's what I'm doing, Birdwell.

119
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,866
You all look here now.

120
00:15:55,453 --> 00:15:57,371
Shut up.

121
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,223
All right, that's it.

122
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,561
We got a long night together...

123
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,315
and I don't want to hear nothing but snoring.

124
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:43,088
Well, you know you can't win them all.
No, I'll give you another shot. I promise.

125
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:46,007
Nope. All right, now.
We'll see you later.

126
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:50,846
- If my hospital calls, you ain't seen me.
- You got it, doc. Hey, what about him?

127
00:16:51,305 --> 00:16:54,600
- I'll see him next week.
- Want me to do anything to him?

128
00:16:55,184 --> 00:16:57,478
I'll take care of you in a minute.

129
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,360
No, sign says four today for blood.

130
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:06,405
Yeah? Don't believe everything you read, Zaranska.

131
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,247
- Hey, give me a sandwich.
- Fifty cents.

132
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:17,542
Man, I know what it is.
Man, give me a sandwich.

133
00:17:22,006 --> 00:17:24,008
Give me a sandwich, buddy.

134
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,307
Sandwich.

135
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:32,434
Fresh out this morning.

136
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,894
Why don't you have a look around?

137
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:44,196
Are you finished with that,
Mr. Caldwell?

138
00:17:44,363 --> 00:17:46,365
Two bits.

139
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,415
- Fifty cents.
- Seventy-five.

140
00:17:53,623 --> 00:17:55,292
What?

141
00:17:56,293 --> 00:17:58,170
Sold.

142
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,349
You just cost me 50 cents
that was needed elsewhere.

143
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,506
Go ahead. It's protein.

144
00:18:42,051 --> 00:18:45,013
No, don't. Stop it.
No, come on.

145
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,141
Wait! No, please don't!

146
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:51,353
Stop it! Let me go!

147
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,522
No!

148
00:18:56,401 --> 00:19:00,154
No, let me go! Let me go! Stop it!

149
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:01,305
- Climb in the truck.
- Hey, Rauch. Rauch!

150
00:20:01,472 --> 00:20:05,225
Where you going with those boys?
I gotta get this stuff milled today.

151
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:08,104
I gotta tell my insurance company
what my inventory is.

152
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,398
Mr. Woodward, I gave you 20 people today...

153
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:13,485
and I'm down on my count.
I got people all over.

154
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:18,949
- I don't care other people's problems.
- All right, I almost forgot this.

155
00:20:19,116 --> 00:20:22,161
I got you a nice sirloin tip here.

156
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,416
Warden Renfro's gonna hear direct
you don't come through on this.

157
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:29,961
Now, sir, don't you worry.

158
00:20:56,365 --> 00:20:58,742
This one, up it. Let's go.

159
00:21:00,536 --> 00:21:02,664
Hey, I'll take it.

160
00:21:02,831 --> 00:21:04,499
Thanks, man.

161
00:21:10,672 --> 00:21:14,135
Hey, I do that. I do that.

162
00:21:20,057 --> 00:21:23,270
- Where's my meat?
- It's coming in the back there.

163
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,485
What? You told me two steers.
That ain't two steers.

164
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:34,657
- Sorry, I couldn't do it this week.
- Hey, don't tell me couldn't.

165
00:21:34,824 --> 00:21:37,243
Suppose I can't spare you
no beer this week.

166
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:40,705
I'll make it up to you. All right?

167
00:21:44,918 --> 00:21:47,004
Where's Carol at?

168
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:49,673
Back at the house.

169
00:21:50,632 --> 00:21:52,885
Back to truck.

170
00:22:11,447 --> 00:22:15,661
<i>For another 20, I'll give you the name
of a stoolie who knows cannons.</i>

171
00:22:15,827 --> 00:22:19,665
- <i>You give me back my dough.</i>
- <i>Who told you to ask me?</i>

172
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:23,710
- <i>The pin boy in the bowling alley.</i>
- <i>Who told you to ask him?</i>

173
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:27,382
<i>A fella that works at the
Houston Street auction shop.</i>

174
00:22:28,091 --> 00:22:31,886
- Oh, shit!
- Wash your mouth out.

175
00:22:36,392 --> 00:22:40,771
- What time you coming up there tonight?
- I can't, my brother's got me working.

176
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,456
Your brother's got you working?

177
00:22:43,023 --> 00:22:46,945
No, he doesn't, because I just
bought you the night off.

178
00:23:03,504 --> 00:23:06,549
What are you doing?
Get on those logs and start moving them.

179
00:23:06,716 --> 00:23:09,928
- You move them, asshole.
- You're asking for it, boy.

180
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:19,188
Floyd!

181
00:23:19,355 --> 00:23:20,606
Yeah, Huey?

182
00:23:20,773 --> 00:23:22,984
What do you got them doing?
Taking a nap?

183
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,486
What are you doing?
Get back to work now.

184
00:23:25,653 --> 00:23:27,363
- Huey, don't get excited-
- Floyd!

185
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,867
Hey, Huey, take it easy now.
Let me explain-

186
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:32,327
Floyd, shut up, will you?

187
00:24:02,486 --> 00:24:05,906
All right, just for that
it went up to six bits. Six bits.

188
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:08,700
They want you up at the bars, Bullen.

189
00:24:08,867 --> 00:24:12,914
All right, who wants it, man?
The last peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

190
00:24:13,081 --> 00:24:15,541
Half a rock. Who wants it?

191
00:24:30,224 --> 00:24:32,560
You got yourself a phone call.

192
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:34,437
Fuck.

193
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:38,233
Look here, Eddie. Why a phone call?

194
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,443
- Let's go.
- A phone call?

195
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:43,781
Why a fucking phone call?!

196
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,909
Hey. What's-?

197
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:48,786
What's with the phone call?

198
00:24:59,756 --> 00:25:02,843
I'm getting ready to say
something important now.

199
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,680
I wanna know that when I talk
I'm being listened to.

200
00:25:06,014 --> 00:25:10,518
I'm getting ready to give out the detail.
Leonard, I want you to go to kitchen.

201
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:12,478
Collins.

202
00:25:12,645 --> 00:25:15,524
- Boiler house.
- Sanitation detail.

203
00:25:15,691 --> 00:25:17,818
You too, Bullen.

204
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:20,154
Wait a minute. This man is hurt-

205
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:24,033
You just deal with colored.
I'll take care of the white folks, okay?

206
00:25:25,452 --> 00:25:28,121
Besides, I don't think Bullen's
got much more than...

207
00:25:28,288 --> 00:25:30,832
refried shit for brains this morning.

208
00:25:30,999 --> 00:25:34,502
Now what about your boy Boyd for clerical?

209
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,072
Come on, come on.
We ain't got all day.

210
00:26:54,132 --> 00:26:55,925
Hey!

211
00:26:57,427 --> 00:27:00,097
I got me a convict here!

212
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,935
I'll rip this cat's head off!

213
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:08,605
You get me the man!
I wanna see the man, now!

214
00:27:09,606 --> 00:27:11,526
I can hear his neck snapping.

215
00:27:12,944 --> 00:27:15,280
Shit. I want some respect.

216
00:27:17,115 --> 00:27:20,535
You sons of bitches hear me out there?
I want some respect!

217
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:22,705
Yeah, we hear you, Walter. We hear you.

218
00:27:22,872 --> 00:27:24,707
I want to see the man!

219
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:27,293
I hear his neck snapping. I do!

220
00:27:28,127 --> 00:27:29,962
- Open this.
- Where are you at?

221
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:31,923
- You want in?
- Open- Yeah.

222
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:35,385
Some fucking respect around here.

223
00:27:36,136 --> 00:27:38,805
R-E-S-P-E-C-T!

224
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,496
<i>Find out what it means to me</i>

225
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,583
<i>What you want</i>

226
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:47,917
<i>A little respect</i>

227
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:49,961
<i>What you need</i>

228
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:51,838
<i>A little respect</i>

229
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:53,298
<i>All I'm asking</i>

230
00:27:53,423 --> 00:27:56,009
<i>For a little respect
when you come home</i>

231
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:59,054
<i>Baby, when you come home</i>

232
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,080
- Stand still.
- Hey!

233
00:28:04,584 --> 00:28:06,086
We talk?

234
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,838
Who the fuck are you?
I want the man!

235
00:28:09,005 --> 00:28:11,841
I am. I am the man.

236
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:15,429
I'm the new warden here.
My name's Henry Brubaker.

237
00:28:23,938 --> 00:28:26,024
Man, don't be fucking with my head.

238
00:28:26,775 --> 00:28:28,985
- New warden, my ass.
- It's true. I swear it.

239
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:34,074
- Then how come you look like a scumbag?
- Because I'm fooling those guys out there.

240
00:29:00,812 --> 00:29:03,565
- When you gonna paint this place?
- What color?

241
00:29:07,737 --> 00:29:09,363
Yellow.

242
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,657
- Yellow.
- Yellow.

243
00:29:12,408 --> 00:29:15,077
And I want a picture window in my place.

244
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:17,914
This yours? This one?

245
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:24,046
One of them high-low pinto shag rugs...

246
00:29:24,212 --> 00:29:30,219
and some liquor and a TV
like them fucking trusties all got.

247
00:29:32,555 --> 00:29:34,307
Some fresh air.

248
00:29:38,437 --> 00:29:40,397
Which wall?

249
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,569
- Which wall what?
- The picture window.

250
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:48,238
Come on, show me exactly.

251
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:11,598
Maybe I want a skylight.

252
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:15,310
Yeah, I want a- I want a skylight.

253
00:30:20,274 --> 00:30:22,151
How you doing?

254
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:23,486
- Open this.
- Do what?

255
00:30:23,653 --> 00:30:26,823
Open it up.
Get this man some medical attention.

256
00:30:26,989 --> 00:30:29,367
Get this place dried out and painted up.

257
00:30:29,534 --> 00:30:31,620
What color?

258
00:30:31,954 --> 00:30:36,166
- Any fucking color he wants.
- Everybody crazy around here.

259
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:38,460
- Where you going now?
- My office.

260
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,342
Mess with me now,
you're gonna regret it later.

261
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:47,178
We don't work this out fast,
you won't be around later.

262
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,513
Do you want ID?

263
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:52,226
Listen, if I raise my right hand,
that tower guard will blow you out.

264
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:57,440
Or you can continue walking with me,
like the smart escort I figure you to be.

265
00:31:15,251 --> 00:31:16,711
Hey! Hey!

266
00:31:16,878 --> 00:31:19,505
- Hold it right there.
- I'm sorry. I'm replacing you.

267
00:31:19,672 --> 00:31:20,882
Coombes, give me a hand.

268
00:31:21,049 --> 00:31:23,342
Call Lillian Gray, assistant to the governor.

269
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:26,555
- Who is this asshole?
- Beats the shit out of me.

270
00:31:26,722 --> 00:31:29,391
- The name is Brubaker.
- He thinks he's the new warden.

271
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:32,227
I didn't want it this way,
but that's the way it is.

272
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:34,105
What is?

273
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:36,691
What is?

274
00:31:36,858 --> 00:31:38,401
You're Willets? Earl?

275
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,862
- Burl.
- Burl, right.

276
00:31:41,029 --> 00:31:43,490
State employee, purchasing agent.

277
00:31:43,656 --> 00:31:47,995
You've been here, uh, uh,
three years, uh, next May.

278
00:31:48,162 --> 00:31:49,747
Five years in Ju- July.

279
00:31:49,914 --> 00:31:51,874
Government service ranking is seven.

280
00:31:52,041 --> 00:31:55,879
You're due for an ingrade raise in May.

281
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:59,174
Yes, sir. That part's all true.

282
00:32:04,638 --> 00:32:05,932
- Captain?
- Yeah?

283
00:32:06,099 --> 00:32:09,102
This is a hell of a note,
that's all I've got to say.

284
00:32:09,268 --> 00:32:12,313
- I mean it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

285
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,950
I'll make sure all your magazines
get forwarded. Don't worry.

286
00:32:26,453 --> 00:32:28,123
You know something, Mr. Brubaker?

287
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:31,292
Smartest thing you ever done
was come in here incognizant.

288
00:32:31,459 --> 00:32:34,170
Dumbest was stepping forward.

289
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:38,509
You want it? You got it. Bye.

290
00:32:46,934 --> 00:32:48,103
<i>Can you hear me-?</i>

291
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:51,857
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

292
00:32:52,023 --> 00:32:55,277
<i>The name is Henry Brubaker.
I'm what the new governor promised.</i>

293
00:32:55,444 --> 00:32:57,070
<i>A reform warden.</i>

294
00:32:57,237 --> 00:33:00,658
That sneaks in like James-fucking-Bond!

295
00:33:04,287 --> 00:33:07,498
Purcell? Here, give me that.

296
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:12,963
<i>See this? This thing is gone.</i>

297
00:33:15,758 --> 00:33:18,302
<i>Any trusty wants to go back
to raking rocks...</i>

298
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:21,598
<i>just get caught using this
on one of your charges.</i>

299
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,771
If an inmate is to attempt an escape,
should we just sort of wave so long or-

300
00:33:27,937 --> 00:33:30,023
- <i>Shoot him.</i>
- We can't hear you over here.

301
00:33:30,191 --> 00:33:34,153
<i>He asked me what happens if an inmate tries to escape.
I said, "Shoot him."</i>

302
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,572
<i>Wound him because nobody's getting paroled...</i>

303
00:33:36,739 --> 00:33:39,200
<i>for trying to kill escaping inmates.</i>

304
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,208
<i>Let's get something straight.
I figure most of you guys belong here.</i>

305
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:51,255
<i>I figure basically you don't have any respect
for other people or yourselves.</i>

306
00:33:51,631 --> 00:33:54,342
<i>You want more from me,
you're gonna have to earn it.</i>

307
00:33:56,636 --> 00:34:00,640
<i>We're gonna figure out some way
to make this run like a 20th century farm.</i>

308
00:34:00,807 --> 00:34:03,727
<i>You're gonna stop selling blood
to buy decent food.</i>

309
00:34:03,894 --> 00:34:06,355
<i>You'll go in those fields
and plant vegetables.</i>

310
00:34:06,855 --> 00:34:08,941
What you got your bubbles on for, Cleaves?

311
00:34:09,108 --> 00:34:11,485
Mr. Deach, ain't no woman
can come in here.

312
00:34:12,404 --> 00:34:14,572
It's all right, Ruben.

313
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,244
<i>From now on, no more 15-hour shifts.</i>

314
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:21,246
<i>The beef you raise on this farm...</i>

315
00:34:21,413 --> 00:34:25,334
<i>is gonna be eaten on this farm by everyone.</i>

316
00:34:27,086 --> 00:34:29,004
What the-?

317
00:34:31,424 --> 00:34:35,345
He was an army lieutenant.
He ran a military stockade in Maryland.

318
00:34:35,512 --> 00:34:37,347
...to enforce the laws of this state.

319
00:34:37,514 --> 00:34:38,723
This is ridiculous.

320
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:42,436
I found him teaching penology
at Price University three years-

321
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,105
Hold on. How old are you?

322
00:34:44,355 --> 00:34:45,773
- Forty.
- Forty.

323
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:48,943
To enforce the laws of this state
and of the United States.

324
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,362
- This is ridiculous.
- "To enforce the laws-"

325
00:34:51,529 --> 00:34:53,865
- We've got-
- I understand your problem.

326
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:56,702
...prison without taking a loyalty oath.

327
00:34:56,869 --> 00:35:00,914
I stressed to the governor the promise
that he clean up the prisons...

328
00:35:01,081 --> 00:35:04,418
if he got elected,
and he always delivers on his promises.

329
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:07,630
- To be respectful to my superiors.
- A couple of weeks.

330
00:35:07,797 --> 00:35:10,508
Yeah, Brubaker was in as a rankman
for a couple weeks.

331
00:35:10,675 --> 00:35:14,971
- No publicity on how I came in here.
- You got some good men on your side.

332
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:17,892
- Hey, it's good, strong stuff.
- I know what I'm saying.

333
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:20,269
- No publicity.
- I quite agree.

334
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,021
Kill that last part.

335
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:24,315
I don't know how you pulled this off...

336
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:27,569
but I can't be kept in the dark
on something like this.

337
00:35:27,736 --> 00:35:31,656
And Lillian knows that now.
Chairman of the Prison Board...

338
00:35:31,823 --> 00:35:34,493
must approve everything
pertaining to the prison.

339
00:35:34,659 --> 00:35:38,039
I hope you're not one of those people
gonna start screaming...

340
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,540
for free-world guards.

341
00:35:39,707 --> 00:35:42,585
I don't know.
How long have you been on the Prison Board?

342
00:35:42,752 --> 00:35:45,630
- Did I say that? Brilliant.
- Seventeen years this summer.

343
00:35:45,797 --> 00:35:48,801
Print it. Credit the governor. Bye-bye.

344
00:35:49,885 --> 00:35:53,013
Well, John, what do you think
of our new warden?

345
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:59,187
I'm trying to get a fix on what
his first order of business here is gonna be.

346
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:03,733
Blow the place up. Start from scratch.

347
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:08,572
You're making a joke, of course.

348
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,745
Of course.

349
00:36:15,246 --> 00:36:16,539
Yes.

350
00:36:30,763 --> 00:36:32,557
- Learn much?
- Not enough.

351
00:36:33,266 --> 00:36:37,019
- I've never seen anything like this place.
- There isn't anything like it.

352
00:36:37,186 --> 00:36:39,856
Understand the problem's
not just inside the prison.

353
00:36:40,022 --> 00:36:42,443
I do. That's why I have to move so fast.

354
00:36:42,609 --> 00:36:44,778
Carefully.

355
00:36:44,945 --> 00:36:48,407
- It's the same thing, Lillian.
- Henry, this is very important to me.

356
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,200
No kidding.

357
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:56,666
You're one of the strangest individuals
I've ever laid my eyes on.

358
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:01,045
I've got an 11:00, Lillian.
What's the problem?

359
00:37:01,213 --> 00:37:05,301
She was saying you're one of the most
punctual individuals she's worked with.

360
00:37:05,468 --> 00:37:09,263
- I'll call you later in the week.
- I know you will.

361
00:37:14,019 --> 00:37:16,146
- Man, this is pathetic.
- That's it.

362
00:37:16,313 --> 00:37:18,648
- This just don't cut it.
- That's all I've got.

363
00:37:18,815 --> 00:37:20,150
Well, you're out of luck.

364
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:23,446
Look, I needs a supervisor's desk job like you.

365
00:37:23,613 --> 00:37:25,782
Anyway, you's overworked.

366
00:37:25,948 --> 00:37:28,201
Hey, man, it ain't up to me alone.

367
00:37:30,286 --> 00:37:32,789
- Purcell, can I see you a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

368
00:37:32,956 --> 00:37:34,917
Oh, I gotta-

369
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,004
I love what you did
with old John Deach out there.

370
00:37:39,171 --> 00:37:41,465
A lot of people gonna get a kick out of that.

371
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:45,303
- The day that-
- Who was that lady out there, by the way?

372
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:51,893
The day that I came in on the bus,
trusties put a man on. Gunshot wound.

373
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,649
Is he okay?

374
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,984
- What do you mean?
- I mean how is he?

375
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:03,239
Is he okay? Is he back in the barracks?
Is he a security risk? I mean, how is he?

376
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:07,911
Well, I imagine we shipped him on off
to the county hospital, don't you?

377
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:09,996
Find out.

378
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:15,670
And could you get me
a dozen pair of sunglasses, please?

379
00:38:15,837 --> 00:38:17,672
All right.

380
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:24,178
You want them polarized or tinted?
You want the kind that have the mirrors?

381
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,974
People can't see in,
makes them nervous as hell.

382
00:38:27,141 --> 00:38:29,810
Just the regular glasses.

383
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:32,438
You got them.

384
00:38:36,693 --> 00:38:39,946
- Look, captain-
- Don't call me captain.

385
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:47,371
Mr. Brubaker, I know you're probably
getting ready...

386
00:38:47,538 --> 00:38:50,624
to make some new job assignments
around here.

387
00:38:50,958 --> 00:38:54,795
You'll probably even name
your own warden's clerk.

388
00:38:55,546 --> 00:39:00,260
Well, if you got a minute, I'd like to take a shot
at making a case for myself.

389
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,233
Hey, I know I'm not
the smartest guy in the world...

390
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:17,987
but I do know this job.

391
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:23,368
And I know this damn place better
than any man here. And that's a fact.

392
00:39:23,911 --> 00:39:27,831
I've been the warden's clerk here
for eight years. I know it.

393
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:35,757
What you got here mainly are rural people.
You know what I mean?

394
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:42,932
Well, they're not much at paperwork.
No sophistication. They....

395
00:39:43,516 --> 00:39:46,435
I'm not trying to put anybody down,
don't get me wrong.

396
00:39:46,602 --> 00:39:52,609
I'm just telling you the way it is.
And that is the way it is.

397
00:39:52,943 --> 00:39:55,779
What are you in for, Purcell?

398
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:59,032
- Nothing really. I-
- Nothing?

399
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:04,789
Well, I held up a card game,
if you're ready. Pretty stupid, huh?

400
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,126
Undoubtedly, they were cheating you.

401
00:40:08,459 --> 00:40:10,545
Absolutely.

402
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:13,632
That's a fact.

403
00:40:17,636 --> 00:40:24,060
Anyway, you need something,
I'm your man, okay?

404
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:26,020
Well, just the sunglasses for now.

405
00:40:26,187 --> 00:40:27,981
You got them.

406
00:40:28,898 --> 00:40:31,192
- They all for you?
- None for me.

407
00:40:32,235 --> 00:40:34,280
Gotcha.

408
00:40:35,906 --> 00:40:37,992
What is you gonna do about my parakeet?

409
00:40:38,159 --> 00:40:40,828
Abraham, come on, will you?
Tell your story walking.

410
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,248
- Take a hike.
- They let him out on purpose.

411
00:40:43,415 --> 00:40:45,333
Yeah, I know, your poor bird. Jesus!

412
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,169
- Roy, Roy.
- What?

413
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:48,837
Do I get the desk job?

414
00:40:49,004 --> 00:40:51,339
You want a desk job, huh?

415
00:40:51,506 --> 00:40:55,261
Well, I got a desk job for you.
Spell "ophthalmology."

416
00:40:55,428 --> 00:40:57,513
Say what?

417
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:01,100
Come on, come on.

418
00:41:32,843 --> 00:41:36,223
From now on these men get out once a day,
not every six months.

419
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:38,558
All right, sir.

420
00:41:39,351 --> 00:41:42,896
Purcell, I wanna see Bullen
at the house tonight.

421
00:41:43,063 --> 00:41:45,232
Now, let's take a look at that boiler.

422
00:42:02,584 --> 00:42:04,545
You say come in?

423
00:42:05,963 --> 00:42:07,632
Look, I don't like being here.

424
00:42:07,799 --> 00:42:11,177
Looks like I'm sucking up to the man,
you know what I mean?

425
00:42:14,556 --> 00:42:19,395
- You're a lifer.
- Habitual criminal. The big bitch.

426
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:22,398
You don't wanna get on my bad side.

427
00:42:22,565 --> 00:42:27,319
Word is that I'm dangerous.
How about you setting that weapon aside?

428
00:42:31,741 --> 00:42:34,244
How about you take off them glasses?

429
00:42:42,253 --> 00:42:46,340
Now, it says here that they put you away
for breaking a toilet.

430
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:52,681
- Says you quit school in the 3rd grade.
- I ain't never quit nothing in my life.

431
00:42:53,348 --> 00:42:58,145
Born Louisiana, twin brother run over
by a train at 15.

432
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:01,858
You were both trying to escape
the Hartsville Reformatory in Texas.

433
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:05,695
Yeah, well, they shot Hollis
and laid him on the tracks...

434
00:43:05,862 --> 00:43:09,532
so the train would squash him up
and make it look like an accident.

435
00:43:11,494 --> 00:43:13,871
Kind of soured me, you know?

436
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:20,169
I got away, got arrested for stealing
a '65 Pontiac sedan.

437
00:43:20,878 --> 00:43:23,882
Got two years for that, and I done them.

438
00:43:24,508 --> 00:43:28,970
I got arrested for stealing
a '69 Pontiac convertible.

439
00:43:29,387 --> 00:43:30,680
You big on Pontiacs?

440
00:43:31,014 --> 00:43:36,187
Bone white, leather, oxblood upholstery...

441
00:43:36,354 --> 00:43:38,606
big, huge, chrome fender skirts.

442
00:43:38,773 --> 00:43:40,900
How'd they compare?

443
00:43:41,067 --> 00:43:44,863
They fucked up the engine in '69,
if you ask me.

444
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:49,743
- Anyway, I got three years for that.
- Another felony.

445
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,246
Then come the toilet.

446
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,707
I got picked up for vagrancy, misdemeanor.

447
00:43:54,874 --> 00:43:57,627
The next morning,
the toilet's broke off the wall.

448
00:43:57,919 --> 00:44:02,799
There's six men in the cell. They stick me
with destruction of city property over $50.

449
00:44:02,966 --> 00:44:05,302
Felony number three.

450
00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:07,471
Habitual.

451
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:12,226
- Judge gives you life for the toilet.
- Yeah, or give me the toilet for life.

452
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,312
Same difference.

453
00:44:14,729 --> 00:44:18,316
Anyhow, here I am,
shoveling shit for dead men.

454
00:44:19,401 --> 00:44:22,320
Instead, how'd you like to be a trusty...

455
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:24,322
and run my motor pool?

456
00:44:27,326 --> 00:44:32,498
Mr. Brubaker, I been studying you
since you first come in...

457
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:37,546
and it's come clear to me that you
are one weird fucking individual.

458
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:41,884
I ain't got you figured out yet,
whether you're a good thing or a bad one.

459
00:44:43,093 --> 00:44:46,014
Does that mean you'll run my motor pool?

460
00:44:47,015 --> 00:44:49,184
Wear them khakis?

461
00:44:49,517 --> 00:44:51,227
Get me a guitar?

462
00:44:51,853 --> 00:44:54,272
Be the warden's new boy?

463
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,610
No, you're smarter than that.

464
00:44:57,776 --> 00:45:00,112
The whole world's fucked up, Mr. Brubaker.

465
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:02,031
Yeah.

466
00:45:02,698 --> 00:45:04,783
There ain't no use.

467
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,463
Tower number three.

468
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:19,342
Who am I looking at?
He's looking at me.

469
00:45:19,801 --> 00:45:21,636
Up there you got Douglas Mizell.

470
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:26,974
- Who the hell is Doug Mizell?
- A forger. Three times grand theft.

471
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:33,315
I want a rundown on everybody
that's got tower duty.

472
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,320
I do believe that's Purcell's job, sir.

473
00:45:40,073 --> 00:45:44,327
I want only murderers up there,
one-time impulse killers.

474
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:48,331
Well, aren't you taking kind of a chance
doing that? Aren't you?

475
00:45:48,498 --> 00:45:51,085
It's the habituals you can't trust.

476
00:45:51,252 --> 00:45:53,254
Murderers, most of them...

477
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:57,842
already have it out of their systems.
Guys like you, right?

478
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,766
There's nobody around here like me.

479
00:46:07,435 --> 00:46:09,187
On death row, why'd you let me go?

480
00:46:09,354 --> 00:46:12,483
You tell me. You're the man.

481
00:46:17,822 --> 00:46:21,368
You're trying to cover yourself
both ways, right?

482
00:46:22,202 --> 00:46:25,622
- You're in for murder, aren't you?
- I thought that you...

483
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:30,502
- asked me to come here so you could-
- All this good land, all this acreage...

484
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:34,674
livestock, and everybody's starving.
Except guys like you.

485
00:47:09,712 --> 00:47:12,840
- Did you eat?
- I don't eat that shit you eating.

486
00:47:14,107 --> 00:47:16,470
You know a lot about nutrition?

487
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:18,889
I know about hungry.

488
00:47:19,056 --> 00:47:21,391
Do you like being a trusty?

489
00:47:23,727 --> 00:47:25,230
Better than being a rankman.

490
00:47:25,396 --> 00:47:28,983
I suppose you're getting used to reform wardens,
seen a lot of them.

491
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:32,403
Every warden is a reform warden.

492
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:34,405
Not Renfro.

493
00:47:34,573 --> 00:47:36,784
- Not Renfro?
- No.

494
00:47:36,951 --> 00:47:40,496
Where you think those clothes came
from the rankmen's wearing?

495
00:47:40,663 --> 00:47:43,374
You think we got some special factory
that makes rags?

496
00:47:43,541 --> 00:47:47,337
Renfro got those clothes brand-new,
just like the ones you'll bring in.

497
00:47:47,504 --> 00:47:49,297
- How do you know-?
- The same rags...

498
00:47:49,464 --> 00:47:52,676
- the next reform warden will throw out.
- Let me ask you...

499
00:47:52,843 --> 00:47:55,428
something about being a trusty.

500
00:47:55,596 --> 00:47:58,850
When you're out in the fields,
sitting on your horse...

501
00:47:59,016 --> 00:48:03,312
and you're holding your gun,
holding all the cards...

502
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:06,316
what keeps you from taking off?

503
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:10,362
Mr. Brubaker, sir...

504
00:48:10,529 --> 00:48:14,199
I wouldn't go around and be putting
these ideas in nobody's head.

505
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:17,495
One day we could just lay down
all the shovels and our gun...

506
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:21,332
and stop playing the man's game.
Pick up and run off.

507
00:48:32,011 --> 00:48:33,679
Hello. Brubaker.

508
00:48:33,846 --> 00:48:36,891
Yeah. Hang on.

509
00:48:37,057 --> 00:48:40,729
Coombes. Coombes?

510
00:48:40,896 --> 00:48:43,732
- Yeah?
- For you.

511
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:50,072
Yeah?

512
00:48:50,239 --> 00:48:52,033
What?

513
00:48:52,533 --> 00:48:54,202
How many hurt?

514
00:48:54,368 --> 00:48:56,704
What about security?

515
00:48:56,871 --> 00:48:58,706
Okay, I'll be right there.

516
00:48:58,874 --> 00:49:00,751
- What's-?
- Are we finished with-?

517
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:04,463
- Yeah. What's wrong?
- The rank barrack's roof just caved in.

518
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:33,328
Hey, you boys get back
to your bunks over there!

519
00:49:43,339 --> 00:49:46,342
You're taking a chance going in there,
you know that?

520
00:49:53,058 --> 00:49:56,186
Somebody kill the current in this building.

521
00:49:56,562 --> 00:49:58,438
Help!

522
00:49:58,605 --> 00:49:59,982
Get off of me!

523
00:50:00,691 --> 00:50:01,984
Give me a hand.

524
00:50:02,151 --> 00:50:04,154
Give me a hand, Coombes!

525
00:50:20,296 --> 00:50:23,717
Holy Christ!
How do we get through that?

526
00:50:28,638 --> 00:50:30,724
Get these men out of here, now!

527
00:50:30,891 --> 00:50:33,727
What are you gonna do with them?
Put them in your house?

528
00:50:40,234 --> 00:50:44,740
What do you mean, call the state hospital?
You're 20 miles closer.

529
00:50:46,283 --> 00:50:49,161
It's raining like hell outside.

530
00:50:49,828 --> 00:50:53,749
I've got one station wagon.
I can't put them in open trucks.

531
00:50:55,001 --> 00:50:56,753
What?

532
00:50:58,046 --> 00:51:00,256
Listen to me. These are injured men.

533
00:51:00,423 --> 00:51:02,467
No, don't lay down.
Hey, don't lay down.

534
00:51:02,634 --> 00:51:05,554
Put this here. Give me your hand.
Put some pressure on it.

535
00:51:05,721 --> 00:51:07,515
An hour?!

536
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,016
Why?

537
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,101
Why?

538
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:20,195
All right, now, I'm counting on that.
Two ambulances.

539
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:23,198
Yeah, thanks a lot.

540
00:51:27,745 --> 00:51:30,039
We got a bleeder over here!

541
00:51:34,043 --> 00:51:36,712
You gotta get this man to a hospital!

542
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:40,509
- They all gotta be.
- I said I can't afford no more.

543
00:51:40,676 --> 00:51:42,553
Shut up!

544
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:44,221
What did he say?

545
00:51:44,388 --> 00:51:46,056
Nothing.

546
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:48,893
Brubaker, I can't afford no more.

547
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,229
- Shut up!
- Wait a minute.

548
00:51:51,396 --> 00:51:52,814
What's going on here?

549
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:55,233
I said, nothing.

550
00:51:55,567 --> 00:51:58,904
- What's the matter with you?
- You charge for medical attention?

551
00:51:59,071 --> 00:52:00,489
- Who?
- You!

552
00:52:00,656 --> 00:52:04,034
What are you so excited about?
We been doing it this way for years.

553
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:08,915
Get your hands off me! Don't!

554
00:52:09,082 --> 00:52:11,251
You call yourself a doctor?

555
00:52:11,918 --> 00:52:13,920
Get your ass off this farm!

556
00:52:14,087 --> 00:52:15,964
Crazy man! You're a crazy man!

557
00:52:16,131 --> 00:52:18,550
Crazy fool!

558
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:40,783
Zaranska, this is your hospital now.

559
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:42,785
- What? Hell, I-
- You're in charge...

560
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,621
until we get a real doctor.

561
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:46,247
I don't know about hospital-

562
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,791
You know a lot more about it than I do.

563
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,086
Work with me.

564
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:24,081
Looking good, warden.

565
00:53:24,998 --> 00:53:26,583
Willets.

566
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:33,173
We just took delivery on 300 cases
of chili con carne last week.

567
00:53:33,341 --> 00:53:34,968
Where are they now? I wonder.

568
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:37,011
No, I just looked in the locker.

569
00:53:37,178 --> 00:53:39,055
Boys gobble it up?

570
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:42,058
Not the rankmen.

571
00:53:42,225 --> 00:53:44,395
And there's only 50 trusties.

572
00:53:44,562 --> 00:53:48,649
Now, that comes to 7200 cans.

573
00:53:48,816 --> 00:53:52,695
Divided by 50 trusties,
that comes to 144 cans.

574
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,031
And you correct me if I'm wrong.
You okay?

575
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:56,950
You're going too fast for me.

576
00:53:57,450 --> 00:54:00,537
Divided by seven days...

577
00:54:00,704 --> 00:54:06,794
that comes to 20.5 cans of chili
per trusty per day.

578
00:54:06,961 --> 00:54:09,005
Now, does that tell you anything?

579
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:10,673
Willets?

580
00:54:11,883 --> 00:54:13,718
- Are you alive, Willets?
- No, sir.

581
00:54:13,885 --> 00:54:15,344
Great.

582
00:54:15,637 --> 00:54:18,932
Excuse me. The roof just fell in.
People are starving to death.

583
00:54:19,099 --> 00:54:22,060
I'd like you to find out
where all the food is going here.

584
00:54:22,227 --> 00:54:25,439
Purcell, I want this-
You'll do that, Willets?

585
00:54:25,606 --> 00:54:28,151
I want this posted:
Only regulation outfits now...

586
00:54:28,318 --> 00:54:30,695
are prison-issue pants,
boots and shirts.

587
00:54:31,237 --> 00:54:34,199
- We don't have any boots.
- Well, order them.

588
00:54:34,365 --> 00:54:38,621
- But that's Willets' area, acquisitions.
- Roy, no, you order them, would you?

589
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:41,999
And I'm gonna need about 700 pairs.
And no more shaved heads.

590
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:45,127
Yeah, but sizes.
How am I gonna figure out how many nines?

591
00:54:45,294 --> 00:54:47,297
You know that. Come on.

592
00:54:48,882 --> 00:54:51,343
Goddamn, look at you.

593
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:54,054
New blood.
Now, that's what this place needing.

594
00:54:54,262 --> 00:54:56,598
You're Brubaker, am I right?

595
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:01,103
- That's right.
- Don't look like no warden.

596
00:55:02,522 --> 00:55:05,441
Chocolate prune cake in there.

597
00:55:05,608 --> 00:55:08,027
My missis baked it up special for you.

598
00:55:09,571 --> 00:55:12,741
I hate prunes. They cloud my mind.

599
00:55:13,534 --> 00:55:16,620
- I say my name?
- No, but I know who you are.

600
00:55:16,787 --> 00:55:19,958
C.P. Woodward. Call me Woody.
Now, you saying we met?

601
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:23,378
- What can I do for you, Mr. Woodward?
- Roof.

602
00:55:23,545 --> 00:55:26,839
- What?
- Roof. I came about the roof.

603
00:55:28,383 --> 00:55:32,680
Purcell gave me a yell, said you declared
a state of emergency or something.

604
00:55:36,767 --> 00:55:38,811
I thought you just sell lumber.

605
00:55:38,978 --> 00:55:41,982
Oh, I sell it, I grow it,
I mill it, I hammer it.

606
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:44,568
I got wood in my veins.

607
00:55:45,193 --> 00:55:48,613
You just give me your John Hancock there.

608
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:50,323
We'll fix things up tight.

609
00:55:50,491 --> 00:55:51,701
No. No, hold it now.

610
00:55:51,868 --> 00:55:55,371
Don't you wanna go up there
and see what the size of the problem is?

611
00:55:55,538 --> 00:55:57,540
Whatever we find, we'll fix.

612
00:55:57,707 --> 00:55:59,625
See, the damn thing of it is...

613
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:03,839
you get one little pinprick hole
in that tar paper from the factory-

614
00:56:04,006 --> 00:56:07,926
This isn't a question of pinpricks or tar paper.
You built that thing wrong.

615
00:56:08,093 --> 00:56:10,262
You know it.
You built it two years ago...

616
00:56:10,429 --> 00:56:12,599
and I want you to rebuild it.

617
00:56:12,765 --> 00:56:14,684
Of course you do. And don't you worry.

618
00:56:14,851 --> 00:56:19,439
I can help you out on the cost.
I'll bill only my materials full this time around.

619
00:56:19,606 --> 00:56:21,983
This isn't gonna cost me anything.

620
00:56:22,151 --> 00:56:25,279
- You guarantee your work, don't you?
- Of course!

621
00:56:25,446 --> 00:56:29,909
Look, you gotta get on top
of this shit pile, Henry...

622
00:56:30,075 --> 00:56:32,536
and then the job's not just a ball-buster.

623
00:56:32,704 --> 00:56:34,915
I mean, you'll be happier then.

624
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,793
Well, I'm not complaining.

625
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,255
Are you unhappy?
It sure sounds like it to me.

626
00:56:52,058 --> 00:56:54,561
I'm not in the construction business
for my health.

627
00:56:54,728 --> 00:56:56,605
Or anybody else's, it seems.

628
00:56:57,105 --> 00:57:01,318
I am in the middle of my inventory.
It's a pain in the ass, but I rushed over here.

629
00:57:01,527 --> 00:57:04,864
Ain't been anybody coming from Wakefield
to give me a hand lately.

630
00:57:05,031 --> 00:57:08,284
We're not sending any convicts
to you anymore, Mr. Woodward.

631
00:57:08,451 --> 00:57:12,288
- That's slave labor.
- No. It is not.

632
00:57:12,455 --> 00:57:14,832
No, no. You got it all backwards.

633
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,753
See, because this is a community.

634
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:22,758
The people around here don't ostracize this prison.
We accept it.

635
00:57:22,925 --> 00:57:24,468
We cooperate.

636
00:57:24,635 --> 00:57:27,347
It's a two-way street.

637
00:57:27,514 --> 00:57:31,518
Now, you gonna be seeing
a lot of nice things...

638
00:57:31,685 --> 00:57:34,396
from people in the farm-supply business...

639
00:57:34,563 --> 00:57:37,233
- clothing business-
- Lumber business?

640
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:42,905
Take that cake.
Now, the point ain't whether you like prune.

641
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,994
- It's the thought that counts.
- Exactly.

642
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:51,039
It's only smart to accept the stuff,
keep your mouth shut...

643
00:57:51,206 --> 00:57:54,084
and let things run
like they've been going for 100 years.

644
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:57,004
Before we was born even, you and me.

645
00:57:57,630 --> 00:58:00,258
I'm talking about tradition.

646
00:58:00,425 --> 00:58:02,594
Don't fuck with tradition.

647
00:58:03,094 --> 00:58:05,889
Count your own woodpile, Woody.

648
00:58:06,055 --> 00:58:08,225
I'll fix my own roof.

649
00:58:09,059 --> 00:58:13,188
- People are gonna be disappointed in you.
- It won't be the first time.

650
00:58:14,189 --> 00:58:16,317
And I hope you're right. Take this.

651
00:58:16,483 --> 00:58:18,027
Take it.

652
00:58:18,653 --> 00:58:22,199
Purcell, get me all the contracts
and insurance policies on that roof.

653
00:58:22,365 --> 00:58:24,201
I want everything you got.

654
00:58:24,451 --> 00:58:27,120
Whose team are you on, Purcell?

655
00:58:27,329 --> 00:58:30,750
What can I say?
He's the coach for now.

656
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:33,002
Short season.

657
00:58:40,052 --> 00:58:42,387
Oh, no. It's no secret.

658
00:58:42,554 --> 00:58:44,848
Write it all down.

659
00:58:45,057 --> 00:58:48,685
We got prison lumber, prison labor
building motels for people in town...

660
00:58:48,852 --> 00:58:51,856
building people's swimming pools.
That's right.

661
00:58:52,273 --> 00:58:56,778
And my kitchen-rider, my trusty,
is loading our food into state police cars.

662
00:58:56,945 --> 00:58:59,906
State police? It runs that deep?

663
00:59:00,073 --> 00:59:03,118
We're gonna be stepping on more toes
than I imagined.

664
00:59:04,036 --> 00:59:05,621
What's that?

665
00:59:09,792 --> 00:59:13,630
I'm just warning you, because
you're likely to start hearing some things.

666
00:59:13,797 --> 00:59:17,634
All right, I'll be ready to run
some interference for you.

667
00:59:18,134 --> 00:59:21,304
No, no. I'll talk to the governor.
Let me do that.

668
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:24,141
Lilly, can I call you back?

669
00:59:26,227 --> 00:59:27,770
Bye.

670
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:39,157
There you go.

671
00:59:39,324 --> 00:59:41,368
There you go.

672
00:59:41,535 --> 00:59:42,954
There you go.

673
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:46,207
Put some down on there.
Give me some of that stuff there.

674
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:48,751
Hey, wait a minute, man.
There you go.

675
01:00:42,977 --> 01:00:45,772
Where's Huey Rauch?

676
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:48,108
I haven't seen him around.

677
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:19,768
Smell this.

678
01:01:24,356 --> 01:01:27,359
- I'm a city boy.
- Purcell?

679
01:01:35,201 --> 01:01:37,537
That smells like kerosene.

680
01:02:17,831 --> 01:02:20,834
This animal's been shot.
Do you know anything about it?

681
01:02:23,671 --> 01:02:27,133
That truck out there, you don't know
anything about that either, I suppose.

682
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:29,469
Looked like a free-worlder.

683
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,038
Now, what are these?

684
01:02:54,288 --> 01:02:55,957
I don't know.

685
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:00,795
Shacks.

686
01:03:01,671 --> 01:03:03,715
Are they on our property?

687
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:06,176
Let me think.

688
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,305
Honestly...

689
01:03:10,931 --> 01:03:13,851
yeah, I think.

690
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:16,020
Oh, shit.

691
01:03:22,151 --> 01:03:24,989
I don't know who's in there,
I don't know what you're up to.

692
01:03:25,155 --> 01:03:29,285
But we got the new warden from the prison here,
and we're probably coming in.

693
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:30,869
Right?

694
01:03:36,293 --> 01:03:38,169
Probably nobody home.

695
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:42,966
Fuck you, Huey. I ain't hiding in the dark
like no human insect.

696
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:50,391
Yeah? What?

697
01:03:50,558 --> 01:03:52,852
- Good morning.
- Morning.

698
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:56,440
Would you please get your ass out here
and take care of this?

699
01:03:57,482 --> 01:03:59,735
Excuse me. I have a tight schedule.

700
01:03:59,902 --> 01:04:03,488
- <i>With one thing on his mind.</i>
- <i>Don't make it sound like that.</i>

701
01:04:03,655 --> 01:04:06,868
<i>Everything has to be learned.
Even kids have had sex.</i>

702
01:04:07,035 --> 01:04:10,538
<i>Is that what you're going to practice
at your next party?</i>

703
01:04:10,747 --> 01:04:13,958
- How many out there?
- I don't know. Three, four.

704
01:04:15,168 --> 01:04:17,421
<i>I don't want you to get a reputation for-</i>

705
01:04:17,588 --> 01:04:18,672
Pull that up.

706
01:04:18,839 --> 01:04:21,425
<i>I already have one, the wrong kind.</i>

707
01:04:24,345 --> 01:04:27,807
<i>And at the proper time,
to marry a man who respects you.</i>

708
01:04:27,974 --> 01:04:32,687
- <i>I want you to have a good name. I want-</i>
- <i>You want! You want!</i>

709
01:04:32,854 --> 01:04:34,648
<i>Is that all you can say?</i>

710
01:04:37,108 --> 01:04:39,862
You want-?
You want a beer or something?

711
01:04:40,029 --> 01:04:43,532
<i>Don't you ever let me hear you say
anything like that again.</i>

712
01:04:49,539 --> 01:04:52,417
<i>Popeil's improved Veg-O-Matic
stretches food dollars.</i>

713
01:04:52,793 --> 01:04:57,297
<i>Millions bought at $7.77.
Now it's yours for only $5.77.</i>

714
01:04:57,464 --> 01:04:59,091
<i>You save two dollars!</i>

715
01:04:59,258 --> 01:05:01,427
Where's your wallet at?

716
01:05:06,432 --> 01:05:08,726
That's my personal property.

717
01:05:09,269 --> 01:05:11,146
I'm going.

718
01:05:12,022 --> 01:05:14,233
<i>Save two dollars from the former price.</i>

719
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:17,111
<i>Get one today for only $5.77.</i>

720
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,662
- Let me give you-
- I got it. I got it.

721
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:36,841
Hot dog, look what we got here.

722
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,803
That'd be Warden Renfro's monthly supply,
I imagine.

723
01:05:40,970 --> 01:05:43,515
Man took baths in that stuff.

724
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:51,815
Hey, Willets?

725
01:05:52,734 --> 01:05:54,986
Try and stay with me on this one, will you?

726
01:05:55,153 --> 01:06:00,074
Now, the rankmen have been working
sunrise to sunset, growing produce...

727
01:06:00,241 --> 01:06:03,412
so the warden and trusties
could sell it below market value...

728
01:06:03,579 --> 01:06:04,830
to some local cannery...

729
01:06:04,997 --> 01:06:08,375
where the proceeds could go
to buying more chili and soda...

730
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:11,837
which in turn could be resold
to some supermarket chain...

731
01:06:12,004 --> 01:06:14,215
at an even greater profit.

732
01:06:14,382 --> 01:06:16,676
- You think so?
- Do I think so?

733
01:06:17,177 --> 01:06:20,263
What did you do with this chili?
You've been signing it out.

734
01:06:20,430 --> 01:06:24,060
- How about that?
- I signed what Captain Renfro told me to.

735
01:06:25,853 --> 01:06:28,898
You can sign your own severance check,
because you're fired.

736
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:31,817
- I'm civil service.
- Fired.

737
01:06:57,471 --> 01:06:58,806
Hey, this is chaos.

738
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:01,600
How can we handle purchasing without Willets?

739
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:03,477
They're gonna do it.

740
01:07:03,852 --> 01:07:06,481
- Who?
- They're gonna have an election.

741
01:07:06,982 --> 01:07:09,150
Pick an inmate council.

742
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,945
That's a hell of an idea.

743
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,573
- What?
- I said, that's a hell of an idea!

744
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,459
Put it down over there.

745
01:07:26,085 --> 01:07:28,255
Huey! Glad to see you back.

746
01:07:29,089 --> 01:07:33,218
- Something funny about that, is there?
- I can't wait till you bring Carol here.

747
01:07:33,385 --> 01:07:35,804
We all get dibs on that.

748
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:40,852
That's funny as hell.

749
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:44,314
Floyd.

750
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:47,775
Brubaker be turning this place
into a damn jailhouse.

751
01:07:47,942 --> 01:07:51,363
Yeah. Well, he just doesn't know
who's running the place.

752
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:54,033
- Deach will set him straight on that.
- I hope so.

753
01:07:54,199 --> 01:07:56,118
- Floyd?
- Yeah?

754
01:07:56,285 --> 01:07:57,578
Get out of here.

755
01:07:57,745 --> 01:07:59,956
- What?
- Get out of here.

756
01:08:00,123 --> 01:08:02,208
I live here, Huey.

757
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:07,047
Get your stuff and get out of here, Floyd.
I gotta move in here. This is mine now.

758
01:08:07,213 --> 01:08:08,840
All right.

759
01:08:09,550 --> 01:08:13,846
Get my bird and come back
for the rest of my stuff.

760
01:08:14,680 --> 01:08:15,723
Let's go.

761
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,317
Spivey, you take that shack over there.

762
01:08:25,484 --> 01:08:27,319
Bullen, take that one.

763
01:08:46,215 --> 01:08:49,718
It'd be a lot smarter to do this
during the daylight hours.

764
01:08:49,885 --> 01:08:52,222
Not so many people would see the flames.

765
01:08:52,389 --> 01:08:56,518
Maybe that's just exactly why he's doing it now,
you ever think of that?

766
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:18,959
He's crazy.

767
01:09:19,126 --> 01:09:20,460
No, he's not.

768
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:25,633
- He's dangerous.
- Somebody needs to stop him.

769
01:09:26,217 --> 01:09:27,677
Put a bullet in him.

770
01:09:37,229 --> 01:09:39,773
There's a disease growing in there, Henry.

771
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,067
Hostile to your health.

772
01:09:42,776 --> 01:09:44,028
I know that.

773
01:09:44,194 --> 01:09:48,408
You ought to get yourself some paper cups
or plates or something.

774
01:09:55,249 --> 01:09:59,170
You ought to get yourself someone
to look after you around here.

775
01:10:00,046 --> 01:10:03,299
That doesn't sound like the kind of advice
I'd expect from you.

776
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:06,511
No, I meant....

777
01:10:06,678 --> 01:10:09,139
I meant one of those convicts.

778
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:12,267
So how's it going?

779
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:18,524
If the Chinese invade us...

780
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:20,652
I got insurance.

781
01:10:21,069 --> 01:10:25,615
If we have a landslide, earthquake,
a volcano erupts, I'm covered.

782
01:10:25,782 --> 01:10:29,620
If a roof caves in, nothing.
No insurance.

783
01:10:30,746 --> 01:10:33,832
- What are you gonna do?
- We're gonna rebuild it ourselves.

784
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:36,126
- Terrific!
- Terrific?

785
01:10:36,293 --> 01:10:40,548
Yes. The governor's been wanting to come
down here for a while. It's a perfect time.

786
01:10:40,715 --> 01:10:42,884
He'll actually see something happening.

787
01:10:43,218 --> 01:10:47,347
Have a few pictures taken, shake a few hands,
put his arm around an inmate.

788
01:10:47,514 --> 01:10:49,600
It's what you call a photo opportunity.

789
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:52,061
That was uncalled for.
Tom's not like that and you know it.

790
01:10:52,228 --> 01:10:54,772
- I don't know Tom.
- He hired you, didn't he?

791
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:57,066
But I need a doctor here, not a governor.

792
01:10:57,233 --> 01:10:58,277
You need both.

793
01:10:58,443 --> 01:11:01,989
- I know what I need here.
- No, I know what you need here.

794
01:11:02,197 --> 01:11:05,492
It's a very complex world out there, Henry.

795
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:10,790
I'm dealing with a lot of people who would rather
not see that prison change at all.

796
01:11:11,874 --> 01:11:15,670
And they're sure letting me know about it.
I've been hit from all sides.

797
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:18,548
I got people out there
trying to shoot my cattle.

798
01:11:18,715 --> 01:11:23,095
Got trusties inside here sabotaging my crops
and there's not a thing I can do.

799
01:11:23,262 --> 01:11:24,722
Why not?

800
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:30,395
Do you know what happens if I rank a man,
if I send a trusty into the barracks?

801
01:11:30,562 --> 01:11:33,773
- What?
- He's dead. Other men will kill him.

802
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:36,359
Can't you work with them?
Change their attitude?

803
01:11:36,526 --> 01:11:38,069
I'm trying.

804
01:11:38,903 --> 01:11:40,071
But I gotta deliver.

805
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:43,159
I can't come in here
and just paint this place.

806
01:11:43,784 --> 01:11:45,328
Lillian....

807
01:11:45,828 --> 01:11:47,079
a permanent doctor.

808
01:11:47,413 --> 01:11:50,791
Yeah, yeah. I know.
I am getting you one. I am.

809
01:11:51,084 --> 01:11:54,171
Look, there's a prison board meeting
on Tuesday night.

810
01:11:54,630 --> 01:11:56,590
I want you there.

811
01:11:57,007 --> 01:11:59,092
The great diplomat.

812
01:12:00,052 --> 01:12:01,261
I'll take that risk.

813
01:12:01,428 --> 01:12:03,806
They're bringing in some deputy warden...

814
01:12:03,973 --> 01:12:07,143
who's gonna give us a nice little talk
on prison reform.

815
01:12:09,020 --> 01:12:11,856
I see, and you want me there
to defend myself.

816
01:12:12,024 --> 01:12:14,777
No, I want a second opinion
in that room, Henry.

817
01:12:14,943 --> 01:12:16,236
State your case!

818
01:12:16,403 --> 01:12:20,240
They need to meet you.
I mean, you do make an impression, right?

819
01:12:38,605 --> 01:12:40,524
All right!

820
01:13:05,382 --> 01:13:07,217
Father, give him a kiss.

821
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:09,678
<i>Vote for Frank Zaranska
He will help you</i>

822
01:13:09,762 --> 01:13:12,181
<i>Pray and he will pull for you</i>

823
01:13:12,306 --> 01:13:14,933
<i>Don't you listen to them others</i>

824
01:13:15,017 --> 01:13:17,311
<i>They'll lie and cheat and screw you</i>

825
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:26,153
Warden!

826
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:40,388
All right!

827
01:13:48,129 --> 01:13:51,466
Damn, this is like sitting
on top of the world, ain't it?

828
01:13:57,848 --> 01:14:00,392
God almighty.

829
01:14:03,312 --> 01:14:05,606
Hey, you know what I'd like
to do with her?

830
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:09,611
Yeah, I know what you'd like to do.

831
01:14:10,695 --> 01:14:12,656
Well, you're wrong.

832
01:14:13,907 --> 01:14:15,909
Do you ever just want to talk?

833
01:14:16,284 --> 01:14:19,789
Shit. You've been whacking it so long, Bullen...

834
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:23,250
your mind's starting to collapse in on itself.

835
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:37,766
- Brubaker.
- Yeah?

836
01:14:37,933 --> 01:14:41,938
You know something? That's the first
I've heard those guys laugh in 15 years.

837
01:14:42,188 --> 01:14:44,273
It doesn't bother you, does it?

838
01:14:52,616 --> 01:14:55,119
Oh, man, I tell you,
we gotta hang in together.

839
01:14:55,285 --> 01:14:58,789
We gotta put men on that council
that got their heads screwed on...

840
01:14:58,956 --> 01:15:03,670
because Brubaker will use the council
to take away your power completely!

841
01:15:03,837 --> 01:15:06,673
He already took away
my refrigerator and my locker.

842
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:08,758
I hear he's putting a new lock on the gate.

843
01:15:08,925 --> 01:15:10,593
There. You see?

844
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:17,685
My name is Jerome L. Boyd.

845
01:15:17,852 --> 01:15:21,022
And I got what is called
a sociopathic personality.

846
01:15:21,814 --> 01:15:23,608
A sociopathic personality.

847
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,486
That means I ain't got no feeling
for my fellow man...

848
01:15:26,653 --> 01:15:29,406
because of how my parents fucked me up.

849
01:15:29,614 --> 01:15:31,742
Now hold on a minute now. Listen.

850
01:15:31,908 --> 01:15:34,579
- I deem it an honor...
- How much you gonna pay us?

851
01:15:34,746 --> 01:15:39,584
to throw aside all my hatred for all you
dumb assholes and try and help you.

852
01:15:40,120 --> 01:15:44,833
<i>Sometimes it causes me to tremble!</i>

853
01:15:46,884 --> 01:15:49,219
Let there be a hush on the land.

854
01:15:49,386 --> 01:15:53,265
Gentlemen, Jesus come over down
to my bunk here, Tuesday a week.

855
01:15:53,432 --> 01:15:56,686
And he hovered up there, kind of hovered.
You know what he said?

856
01:15:56,853 --> 01:15:58,146
- What'd he say?
- Say what?

857
01:15:58,313 --> 01:16:01,399
- What'd he say?
- Oh, well, he said:

858
01:16:01,566 --> 01:16:05,529
"Frank, many is called, but damn few is chosen.

859
01:16:06,447 --> 01:16:08,366
I'm gonna put you on my first team.

860
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:12,370
And I want you to put these boys
underneath your wing...

861
01:16:12,536 --> 01:16:15,082
and see to it that they get any subscriptions...

862
01:16:15,248 --> 01:16:18,418
to any damn magazines they want
in their barracks!"

863
01:16:18,585 --> 01:16:20,253
All right!

864
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,624
<i>Frankie scores again with a left hand.</i>

865
01:16:27,762 --> 01:16:29,764
Now, I am corrupt.

866
01:16:29,931 --> 01:16:33,059
That's right.
Just like the rest of you.

867
01:16:33,226 --> 01:16:37,106
But I am honest about it.

868
01:16:37,564 --> 01:16:41,402
Now, you vote for Mr. Clarence...

869
01:16:41,568 --> 01:16:44,738
know exactly what you get.

870
01:16:58,045 --> 01:16:59,088
- Zaranska?
- Yes?

871
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:02,258
- One vote, now. One vote.
- One vote. One vote.

872
01:17:02,425 --> 01:17:05,094
Don't be such an old woman, Duane.
One vote, one vote.

873
01:17:05,261 --> 01:17:07,013
Oh, feel the power!

874
01:17:07,179 --> 01:17:11,518
- Feel mysterious wonders working within.
- Hallelujah! Can I get witness?

875
01:17:11,685 --> 01:17:14,855
The Lord-
I believe the Lord is with us!

876
01:17:16,355 --> 01:17:17,398
Name?

877
01:17:24,657 --> 01:17:28,494
- What about the doctor?
- Be here this afternoon.

878
01:17:28,912 --> 01:17:31,415
They said he was gonna be here
three days ago.

879
01:17:31,582 --> 01:17:34,043
- Said he's coming about 1:00.
- Would you double-check that?

880
01:17:34,209 --> 01:17:36,295
Yeah. One more.

881
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:51,270
What are you waiting for?

882
01:17:52,313 --> 01:17:53,606
We're waiting on you.

883
01:17:54,106 --> 01:17:57,610
You are the inmate council.
You know how it works. Go on ahead.

884
01:17:57,985 --> 01:17:59,487
I'll be with you in a minute.

885
01:18:11,542 --> 01:18:15,171
Now, wait a minute.
Because that's not the way I understood it.

886
01:18:15,338 --> 01:18:17,382
Lillian Gray got authorization...

887
01:18:17,548 --> 01:18:21,177
for you people to go out and get bids
on that new boiler right away.

888
01:18:24,723 --> 01:18:26,975
Well, how long does his lunch take?

889
01:18:27,476 --> 01:18:30,312
Well, when will he be back from his haircut?

890
01:18:32,315 --> 01:18:35,610
Yes. Would you, please?

891
01:18:35,777 --> 01:18:38,279
Definitely. Yes, today.

892
01:18:38,446 --> 01:18:39,990
Thanks.

893
01:18:58,135 --> 01:18:59,511
Something wrong?

894
01:19:01,555 --> 01:19:04,475
Don't know exactly where to start here,
Mr. Brubaker.

895
01:19:04,642 --> 01:19:07,353
One man, one vote. It's up to you.

896
01:19:07,895 --> 01:19:10,106
You drop the hammer
on what you don't like.

897
01:19:10,273 --> 01:19:11,607
No.

898
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:17,072
All right, then...

899
01:19:17,239 --> 01:19:20,868
I make a motion that we consider a movement...

900
01:19:21,035 --> 01:19:24,914
to discuss the shitty plumbing in the barracks.
How many say aye?

901
01:19:27,917 --> 01:19:29,753
- Aye.
- Thanks.

902
01:19:29,919 --> 01:19:33,673
Uh, somebody should be taking notes about this.

903
01:19:34,049 --> 01:19:36,927
How about Pavitch?
There's a rumor he can write.

904
01:19:38,095 --> 01:19:40,848
Yeah, Pavitch. Take a note.

905
01:19:41,599 --> 01:19:45,186
This coffee tastes like
Zaranska washed his feet in it.

906
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:49,524
Only you'd know about that special flavor,
Larry Lee, you old sock-sucker.

907
01:19:49,691 --> 01:19:52,110
Sir, this is looking like
a damn waste of time.

908
01:19:52,277 --> 01:19:55,030
All right, Caldwell,
then why don't you resign?

909
01:19:56,949 --> 01:19:59,285
We can find a replacement for you fast.

910
01:20:09,338 --> 01:20:10,839
Yeah.

911
01:20:20,642 --> 01:20:24,979
The living facilities are important.
Toilets and beds and such-like.

912
01:20:25,146 --> 01:20:28,192
I think we ought to start there.
It's a good place to start.

913
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:33,989
Can we get a contractor in
or somebody to redo the toilets?

914
01:20:41,915 --> 01:20:45,544
Mr. Spivey, can I see the warden?

915
01:20:45,711 --> 01:20:49,424
Well, the council's in session and these men
got appointments afterwards.

916
01:20:49,590 --> 01:20:52,593
Probably not gonna get in
on account of Mr. Brubaker's...

917
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:56,014
got a prison board meeting tonight
he maybe got to be at.

918
01:20:58,266 --> 01:20:59,559
But I want to see him.

919
01:20:59,727 --> 01:21:03,105
Birdwell, if a trusty escapes off
of minimum security...

920
01:21:03,272 --> 01:21:05,399
- then he can't be a trusty.
- Damn straight.

921
01:21:05,566 --> 01:21:07,651
If you can't trust a trusty,
who can you trust?

922
01:21:07,818 --> 01:21:10,989
Well, sure. But I'm talking
about extenuating circumstances.

923
01:21:11,156 --> 01:21:12,574
For instance, a man escapes.

924
01:21:12,741 --> 01:21:16,953
Then realizing the error of his ways,
gives himself up voluntarily.

925
01:21:17,162 --> 01:21:20,123
- That's horseshit.
- So put him in the hole for 10 days.

926
01:21:20,290 --> 01:21:23,544
I agree. And take away
all his visiting privileges for a month.

927
01:21:23,711 --> 01:21:26,088
What are you talking about,
visiting privileges?

928
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:28,174
Don't let him mail more than a letter a week.

929
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:29,383
I like it.

930
01:21:29,550 --> 01:21:33,972
And send him up to his room and don't let him
watch no TV for a whole damn week.

931
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:37,309
I don't know where you get
your ideas of criminal justice.

932
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:39,811
Up your ass, I believe.

933
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:44,108
Wanna know something, Zaranska?

934
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:47,779
- Sure, Birdy, I'd love to know something.
- About your mama?

935
01:21:50,573 --> 01:21:53,243
Hey, hey, hey, come on!

936
01:21:53,994 --> 01:21:55,454
Come on, Abraham. Let's go.

937
01:21:55,621 --> 01:21:58,707
You get your goddamn hands off him, Purcell!

938
01:21:59,166 --> 01:22:01,543
I got to clean my conscience.

939
01:22:01,919 --> 01:22:04,798
I got something I've got
to tell you about in private.

940
01:22:04,964 --> 01:22:08,968
Listen, Abraham, you don't have
to go explain anything to anybody.

941
01:22:09,135 --> 01:22:11,429
Why don't you come into my office?
Come on.

942
01:22:11,596 --> 01:22:14,100
I got guys waiting outside
that have appointments.

943
01:22:14,266 --> 01:22:18,104
Well, tell them a story, Roy.
You guys can manage.

944
01:22:20,523 --> 01:22:22,274
You're right.

945
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:26,822
I come to Wakefield before World War II.

946
01:22:27,072 --> 01:22:28,448
Take a walk, Purcell.

947
01:22:30,033 --> 01:22:32,285
This ain't open to the public.

948
01:22:35,456 --> 01:22:36,833
Yeah.

949
01:22:38,334 --> 01:22:40,795
We used to make corn liquor out of this.

950
01:22:40,962 --> 01:22:43,297
Growed it at the Camp Five field.

951
01:22:49,805 --> 01:22:51,473
What happened...?

952
01:22:52,975 --> 01:22:54,852
What happened to your eye?

953
01:22:55,019 --> 01:22:56,187
Oh, got hit.

954
01:22:56,354 --> 01:22:57,897
With what?

955
01:22:58,481 --> 01:23:02,819
With a baseball bat, a trace chain...

956
01:23:02,986 --> 01:23:05,989
and a rope with knots in it.

957
01:23:21,798 --> 01:23:24,217
You're doing time for manslaughter?

958
01:23:24,676 --> 01:23:29,140
Yes, sir.
I killed my baby brother with a rock.

959
01:23:29,682 --> 01:23:31,559
How much time?

960
01:23:34,270 --> 01:23:36,272
How much time?

961
01:23:37,357 --> 01:23:39,610
Thirty-five year.

962
01:23:39,777 --> 01:23:42,696
How long have you been in here, Mr. Cooke?

963
01:23:44,615 --> 01:23:47,034
- Hell, I don't know.
- Well, I do.

964
01:23:47,201 --> 01:23:52,332
Thirty-eight years, six months,
according to this.

965
01:24:00,299 --> 01:24:01,801
Yeah.

966
01:24:01,967 --> 01:24:04,679
<i>New doctor's here.
He's out here waiting to say hello.</i>

967
01:24:04,845 --> 01:24:07,056
Great. Tell him just a minute, would you?

968
01:24:07,223 --> 01:24:09,433
There were lots of other guys.

969
01:24:09,685 --> 01:24:14,064
The yard man say,
"Abraham, chop them up in tiny little pieces...

970
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:17,943
and take them for a walk
down in them shadows."

971
01:24:18,235 --> 01:24:19,277
What?

972
01:24:19,444 --> 01:24:22,407
I gave Jake's clothes to the laundry.

973
01:24:22,573 --> 01:24:26,703
Come Christmas Day, I stuck him in close...

974
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:31,333
at the fence, where all them other boys
are dead and buried at now.

975
01:24:32,167 --> 01:24:35,170
Must be over 200 of them out there now.

976
01:24:35,337 --> 01:24:37,297
Wait. Wait a minute.

977
01:24:37,464 --> 01:24:41,886
Are you talking about the bodies that are supposed
to be buried here on this farm?

978
01:24:42,053 --> 01:24:43,096
Yes, sir.

979
01:24:43,430 --> 01:24:44,848
Where?

980
01:24:45,014 --> 01:24:46,933
There's 15,000 acres out there.

981
01:24:47,726 --> 01:24:50,603
I know exactly where they lay.

982
01:24:51,438 --> 01:24:53,774
Camp Five pasture.

983
01:24:53,941 --> 01:24:55,359
How?

984
01:24:56,027 --> 01:24:58,112
Abraham, how do you know?

985
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:02,199
I was the coffin maker.

986
01:25:04,119 --> 01:25:06,288
Mr. Brubaker, this is Dr. Campbell.

987
01:25:06,455 --> 01:25:07,540
Yeah.

988
01:25:08,999 --> 01:25:12,836
Will you show me exactly where
tomorrow morning?

989
01:25:13,004 --> 01:25:14,630
Yes, sir.

990
01:25:17,467 --> 01:25:21,763
That board meeting ought to break up by 10:00,
so I should be home by midnight.

991
01:25:21,929 --> 01:25:23,139
We'll hold the fort.

992
01:25:23,306 --> 01:25:27,186
I need five guys you can trust with shovels
right after breakfast.

993
01:25:27,353 --> 01:25:29,313
I got them, coach.

994
01:25:31,774 --> 01:25:35,320
- What you gonna do about Abraham?
- I got Purcell filling out forms.

995
01:25:35,487 --> 01:25:38,907
- And I'm gonna get him released-
- Why you wanna go and do that?

996
01:25:39,574 --> 01:25:41,159
Do what?

997
01:25:42,327 --> 01:25:45,831
Why don't you just leave him be?
I mean, all he knows is this place.

998
01:25:45,998 --> 01:25:49,835
You knew that he'd been in here
as long as he'd been in here. Didn't you?

999
01:25:50,002 --> 01:25:53,089
Just leave him alone.
He's not bothering nobody.

1000
01:25:53,255 --> 01:25:55,926
You can't hide in prison forever, Coombes.

1001
01:25:59,513 --> 01:26:01,848
Stir up some hell, Henry.

1002
01:26:14,153 --> 01:26:17,032
How you doing, Abraham?
Let me take that from you.

1003
01:26:17,199 --> 01:26:18,867
You got an appointment.

1004
01:26:19,034 --> 01:26:22,287
- What? What?
- A little business.

1005
01:26:22,454 --> 01:26:24,581
Well, where we going?

1006
01:26:28,336 --> 01:26:30,588
Doc wanna see you, Abe.

1007
01:26:32,048 --> 01:26:34,217
I ain't sick.

1008
01:26:46,897 --> 01:26:48,692
Hello, Abe.

1009
01:26:52,988 --> 01:26:56,742
Abe, we got some questions
that have to be answered.

1010
01:26:56,908 --> 01:26:59,746
Then you can get some sleep, all right?

1011
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:02,373
Eddie, get that stuff off there.

1012
01:27:02,540 --> 01:27:04,834
Up on this table here, Abe.

1013
01:27:24,773 --> 01:27:27,692
Hell, I know Captain Brubaker
is an expert at penology...

1014
01:27:27,859 --> 01:27:31,447
but I think he's been out
of the mainstream too long.

1015
01:27:31,614 --> 01:27:34,992
There are 13 states, my own included...

1016
01:27:35,159 --> 01:27:39,455
that still rely on a leather strap
to control the convicts.

1017
01:27:39,914 --> 01:27:43,335
Because other people do it that way
doesn't per se make it right.

1018
01:27:43,502 --> 01:27:45,087
Oh, the hell it doesn't.

1019
01:27:45,253 --> 01:27:49,841
Cuts down on your time lost due to convicts
sitting in the hole, degenerating.

1020
01:27:50,133 --> 01:27:52,678
And it's a simple fact we have to face...

1021
01:27:52,845 --> 01:27:56,808
that crop production at Wakefield's
down nearly 40 percent...

1022
01:27:56,974 --> 01:27:58,643
this last quarter, since you-

1023
01:27:58,810 --> 01:28:01,020
But revenues are up 20 percent.

1024
01:28:01,187 --> 01:28:03,357
If you would just give me a year...

1025
01:28:03,524 --> 01:28:06,485
leave us alone,
and let us eat the food that we grow...

1026
01:28:06,652 --> 01:28:10,155
and sell the rest on the open market,
I'll show you a profit.

1027
01:28:10,322 --> 01:28:12,074
I'll show you a cash surplus.

1028
01:28:12,282 --> 01:28:15,453
Fine. All we're saying is,
give us some warning, Mr. Brubaker.

1029
01:28:15,912 --> 01:28:18,123
So when you go doubling the price of corn-

1030
01:28:18,289 --> 01:28:21,334
Out of the clear blue sky,
you cancel an age-old contract...

1031
01:28:21,501 --> 01:28:24,463
- with C.P. Woodward Lumber.
- There wasn't any contract.

1032
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,549
He was using prisoners for slave labor.

1033
01:28:26,716 --> 01:28:29,260
As far as corn,
we're still a dollar below market.

1034
01:28:29,427 --> 01:28:33,139
How much potential cash surplus
are you talking about here, Mr. Brubaker?

1035
01:28:33,305 --> 01:28:35,684
In farm accounting alone...

1036
01:28:36,476 --> 01:28:38,854
- a hundred and fifty thousand.
- Dollars?

1037
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,773
- Yes, sir.
- Good Lord.

1038
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:46,028
Sounds like we're gonna need some
high-powered Wall Street types...

1039
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:48,531
to help us figure out
where to put it all.

1040
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:51,743
Well, I'd like to put it all
back into the facility.

1041
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:53,995
The place is literally falling apart.

1042
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:58,417
You've got dry rot, disease, rats all over,
not enough place for the men to sleep.

1043
01:28:58,584 --> 01:29:02,504
You've got a boiler that your own state inspectors
condemned six years ago.

1044
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:05,383
We authorized a bid on a new boiler.
Am I wrong?

1045
01:29:05,550 --> 01:29:08,887
- Why won't your purchasing take my calls?
- I'm looking into that.

1046
01:29:09,054 --> 01:29:12,015
While we're at it,
let's look into things like...

1047
01:29:12,182 --> 01:29:14,726
assaulting a doctor,
firing a state employee...

1048
01:29:14,893 --> 01:29:17,188
who's been keeping the books for years.

1049
01:29:17,354 --> 01:29:19,482
- Because he wasn't worth a-
- Well.

1050
01:29:19,648 --> 01:29:24,779
You're letting inmates take over the place,
inmates with fourth-grade educations.

1051
01:29:24,945 --> 01:29:27,324
They don't all have fourth-grade education.

1052
01:29:27,491 --> 01:29:29,743
You're not gonna tell me
that's gonna work.

1053
01:29:29,910 --> 01:29:32,329
The point is these men have to at least...

1054
01:29:32,496 --> 01:29:36,500
feel like they're taking responsibility.
They'll change this place, not me.

1055
01:29:36,666 --> 01:29:40,254
- Well, what the hell are we paying you for?
- All right. Hold it.

1056
01:29:41,422 --> 01:29:46,386
The bottom line here is that you want
to make life real easy for those men.

1057
01:29:46,552 --> 01:29:49,681
- Don't you, Mr. Brubaker?
- No. Not at all.

1058
01:29:50,099 --> 01:29:51,308
I think it is.

1059
01:29:51,475 --> 01:29:54,478
I think you kind of like men like that.

1060
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:57,815
Maybe because they're reckless,
same as you.

1061
01:29:57,982 --> 01:30:02,779
They see something they don't like,
they shoot it up or burn it down.

1062
01:30:02,946 --> 01:30:05,281
Make up their own laws
as they go along.

1063
01:30:05,573 --> 01:30:07,450
I didn't make up those laws. You did.

1064
01:30:07,617 --> 01:30:09,829
Because they've held up our businesses.

1065
01:30:10,413 --> 01:30:13,457
They've raped our daughters
and murdered our sons.

1066
01:30:13,624 --> 01:30:15,668
And so we make them wards of the state...

1067
01:30:15,835 --> 01:30:19,881
which means we accept responsibility
to feed them, to clothe them...

1068
01:30:20,048 --> 01:30:21,675
give them medical attention.

1069
01:30:21,842 --> 01:30:25,637
Not to starve them, not to torture them,
not to humiliate them.

1070
01:30:25,804 --> 01:30:29,642
And if you don't like the laws,
then change them.

1071
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:31,352
In the meantime, it's my job-

1072
01:30:31,519 --> 01:30:34,063
It's your job to listen
to the people who pay you.

1073
01:30:34,230 --> 01:30:36,274
No, sir, it is my job to reform a prison.

1074
01:30:36,566 --> 01:30:38,985
I'm not here to work for a political party...

1075
01:30:39,152 --> 01:30:42,239
- or the state or a governor.
- May I butt in a second?

1076
01:30:42,406 --> 01:30:45,993
Let the record show that State Senator Charles Hite
desires to comment.

1077
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:51,499
Mr. Brubaker, I think you owe it to yourself
to face some hard facts.

1078
01:30:51,666 --> 01:30:55,253
The people in this state have got themselves
a whole lot of problems...

1079
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:59,966
getting jobs, paying rent, insurance premiums.

1080
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:04,472
Now, come election time, they might vote
for your prison-reform thing...

1081
01:31:04,638 --> 01:31:07,600
but that's just a reflex.

1082
01:31:08,059 --> 01:31:10,853
They don't want to hear their taxes
are being raised...

1083
01:31:11,020 --> 01:31:14,107
to take care of murderers and rapists.

1084
01:31:15,567 --> 01:31:19,738
That farm wasn't costing anybody anything...

1085
01:31:19,905 --> 01:31:22,074
before you got your hands on it.

1086
01:31:22,408 --> 01:31:24,702
You follow what I'm saying?

1087
01:31:25,161 --> 01:31:28,289
Why don't we go and build them
a putting green or a clubhouse?

1088
01:31:28,456 --> 01:31:33,087
Or a miniature golf course with a hot,
whirly, bubbly bath in it?

1089
01:31:34,254 --> 01:31:37,216
Why don't we build them a roof
that won't cave in on them?

1090
01:31:37,382 --> 01:31:39,051
That's enough.

1091
01:31:39,551 --> 01:31:41,845
- An insured roof this time.
- What do you mean?

1092
01:31:42,221 --> 01:31:45,100
The collapsed roof isn't covered at all,
that's what.

1093
01:31:45,266 --> 01:31:48,186
But we do have coverage
for thrashing machines...

1094
01:31:48,353 --> 01:31:50,355
bailers, swatters, a tractor.

1095
01:31:50,522 --> 01:31:54,443
Sounds sensible to me to have the things insured.
I approved those policies.

1096
01:31:54,610 --> 01:31:57,571
You did more than that.
Your company sold us the policies.

1097
01:31:57,738 --> 01:32:02,368
The only trouble is, we don't have that equipment
on our farm. It doesn't exist.

1098
01:32:03,244 --> 01:32:07,958
What you have got, Mr. Brubaker,
is a piss-poor attitude.

1099
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:11,378
I don't like you,
but that's beside the point.

1100
01:32:11,545 --> 01:32:12,587
No, it's not.

1101
01:32:12,754 --> 01:32:17,176
And still I'm telling you this
as a favor to Lillian Gray...

1102
01:32:17,343 --> 01:32:20,096
who, for some unknown reason,
believes in you.

1103
01:32:20,388 --> 01:32:23,015
Do not- I repeat:

1104
01:32:23,182 --> 01:32:27,354
Do not come marching in here
from wherever the hell she found you...

1105
01:32:27,521 --> 01:32:31,483
and presume to lecture us about
how to treat our fellow man.

1106
01:32:31,775 --> 01:32:34,695
We're all sitting here for free tonight,
except you.

1107
01:32:34,862 --> 01:32:37,907
We all got better places we could be.

1108
01:32:38,074 --> 01:32:39,534
So do I.

1109
01:32:39,701 --> 01:32:43,163
I think we all better have a little food
and calm down.

1110
01:32:57,554 --> 01:32:59,139
Brubaker!

1111
01:33:00,265 --> 01:33:02,726
How long you gonna last
pulling stunts like this?

1112
01:33:02,893 --> 01:33:05,979
What do you want to hear?
That I know exactly what I'm doing?

1113
01:33:06,146 --> 01:33:08,983
I'm sorry I don't have
all the right answers for you.

1114
01:33:09,150 --> 01:33:12,153
Then make some up.
Because what you've got to understand...

1115
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:14,572
is that they'll pull the plug
on all this.

1116
01:33:15,114 --> 01:33:18,201
And if you're not in the system,
you can't change it.

1117
01:33:18,367 --> 01:33:22,081
Give them something. Let them think
they control you. That's the secret.

1118
01:33:22,247 --> 01:33:25,000
You know who the real obstacles
to prison reform are?

1119
01:33:25,167 --> 01:33:27,795
It's not John Deach
or Senator Whatever-His-Name-Is.

1120
01:33:27,961 --> 01:33:30,173
- Hite.
- Hite. It's prison reformers...

1121
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:31,424
pseudo-reformers.

1122
01:33:31,591 --> 01:33:34,844
People that want to say the right thing,
be at the right place...

1123
01:33:35,011 --> 01:33:37,430
get in the paper,
and get nothing done.

1124
01:33:38,264 --> 01:33:40,559
You see everything
from Brubaker's point of view.

1125
01:33:40,726 --> 01:33:43,062
Everything you do is right,
everyone else is absurd.

1126
01:33:43,229 --> 01:33:46,857
I don't know what's right or wrong.
Everybody's got their own version.

1127
01:33:47,024 --> 01:33:49,693
I'm just interested in what works.

1128
01:33:50,111 --> 01:33:52,614
There's no way to beat guys like that.

1129
01:33:52,781 --> 01:33:55,242
You can't toe the line
because it keeps changing.

1130
01:33:55,409 --> 01:33:57,577
You have to be smarter than they are.

1131
01:33:58,286 --> 01:34:01,207
I've locked the goddamn keys in the car.

1132
01:34:06,045 --> 01:34:07,588
God!

1133
01:34:17,474 --> 01:34:21,770
For the first time, it's occurring to those prisoners
that they don't have to take...

1134
01:34:21,938 --> 01:34:25,358
everything shoved at them,
because they're still human beings.

1135
01:34:25,525 --> 01:34:27,402
So maybe someday, when they do get out...

1136
01:34:27,569 --> 01:34:31,114
they won't rape John Deach's daughter
or murder his son.

1137
01:34:31,281 --> 01:34:33,868
Bravo, but you're full of shit.

1138
01:34:34,034 --> 01:34:36,579
Just not enough to make things work
in that prison.

1139
01:34:36,746 --> 01:34:40,791
- The real problem is out here.
- Out here they don't want to hear you.

1140
01:34:40,958 --> 01:34:42,961
And they don't want to see me.

1141
01:34:43,128 --> 01:34:44,880
So why do you bother?

1142
01:34:45,046 --> 01:34:49,009
Why do you spend day after day
sitting in rooms with people like that...

1143
01:34:49,176 --> 01:34:51,470
and let them make a fool out of you?

1144
01:34:52,596 --> 01:34:55,725
Because sometimes you don't lose.

1145
01:34:56,476 --> 01:34:59,437
And if you can't figure out
how to play these people...

1146
01:34:59,604 --> 01:35:01,355
you are gonna self-destruct.

1147
01:35:02,023 --> 01:35:04,651
And then you'll be of no use to me.

1148
01:37:56,756 --> 01:37:58,633
Turn on the lights.

1149
01:38:14,651 --> 01:38:17,654
I just got the call from the tower.

1150
01:38:18,613 --> 01:38:22,993
Find out why the man on duty in Tower One
didn't report anything.

1151
01:38:24,161 --> 01:38:25,872
Those guys at night, they....

1152
01:38:26,038 --> 01:38:28,249
Find out!

1153
01:38:53,485 --> 01:38:55,236
You had to listen to him, huh?

1154
01:38:56,489 --> 01:38:59,492
- What?
- What?

1155
01:39:00,201 --> 01:39:03,037
Oh, I don't believe men like you.

1156
01:39:03,370 --> 01:39:04,872
You're dangerous men.

1157
01:39:05,039 --> 01:39:07,417
You start wars and let other people fight them.

1158
01:39:07,584 --> 01:39:09,795
You come and talk about,
"Do this, do that.

1159
01:39:09,961 --> 01:39:11,671
Think this way. Be this way."

1160
01:39:11,838 --> 01:39:14,591
You stick a sign in a fool's hand
and say, "Follow me.

1161
01:39:14,758 --> 01:39:18,095
I got the thing figured out.
We can change things for the better."

1162
01:39:19,722 --> 01:39:21,432
Well, that's a lot of bullshit!

1163
01:39:21,599 --> 01:39:23,142
There's only one thing you do.

1164
01:39:23,309 --> 01:39:26,062
And that's get people killed!

1165
01:39:30,776 --> 01:39:32,152
Maybe you're right.

1166
01:39:53,717 --> 01:39:56,095
- You don't wanna go in there now.
- But I have-

1167
01:39:56,262 --> 01:39:58,055
Not now.

1168
01:41:28,905 --> 01:41:31,032
- Warden.
- Yeah?

1169
01:41:31,199 --> 01:41:34,703
There's a Lillian Gray on the phone.

1170
01:41:34,870 --> 01:41:37,039
She's saying it's urgent.

1171
01:42:11,618 --> 01:42:13,620
I'm through talking.

1172
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:19,085
I can't figure out how you found out.

1173
01:42:19,252 --> 01:42:22,464
Nothing happens at that prison
that doesn't get out.

1174
01:42:22,630 --> 01:42:25,341
- Now you're sounding paranoid.
- <i>I'm not paranoid.</i>

1175
01:42:25,508 --> 01:42:27,553
<i>The enemy's real.</i>

1176
01:42:30,556 --> 01:42:32,475
All right. You know the fairgrounds?

1177
01:42:32,641 --> 01:42:35,728
- The auction house where we sell cattle?
- <i>I'll find it.</i>

1178
01:42:35,895 --> 01:42:38,565
- <i>What time in the morning?</i>
- Eight o'clock.

1179
01:42:38,773 --> 01:42:40,609
I'll meet- No. Make it earlier, 7:00.

1180
01:42:40,775 --> 01:42:43,487
I have to be back.
I'll see you at 7:00.

1181
01:43:14,813 --> 01:43:16,314
I said alone.

1182
01:43:16,481 --> 01:43:18,525
He's a friend.

1183
01:43:18,775 --> 01:43:21,987
You haven't actually found anything yet,
have you?

1184
01:43:22,154 --> 01:43:25,407
- No.
- Doesn't matter. It's having its effect.

1185
01:43:45,429 --> 01:43:47,265
- You called him?
- Didn't have to.

1186
01:43:47,598 --> 01:43:49,976
The senator called Lillian last night himself.

1187
01:44:00,946 --> 01:44:05,326
Well, let me put this as simple as I can,
Mr. Brubaker.

1188
01:44:05,493 --> 01:44:07,370
You've gotta stop digging.

1189
01:44:07,537 --> 01:44:08,788
Why?

1190
01:44:08,955 --> 01:44:10,623
Because you have been salaried...

1191
01:44:10,790 --> 01:44:14,712
to run one of the best-conceived prisons
in this country, sir.

1192
01:44:15,045 --> 01:44:19,175
Because although Wakefield
is admittedly an imperfect institution...

1193
01:44:19,341 --> 01:44:20,968
much like America herself...

1194
01:44:21,177 --> 01:44:24,222
she is nonetheless a grand experiment.

1195
01:44:24,431 --> 01:44:27,434
A government of the man, for the man...

1196
01:44:28,059 --> 01:44:29,561
by the man.

1197
01:44:30,395 --> 01:44:35,359
Plus the fact that it's the only prison
in the United States that's shown a profit.

1198
01:44:35,526 --> 01:44:38,821
- What is this horseshit?
- Listen to what he's saying, Henry.

1199
01:44:38,988 --> 01:44:41,908
I think the senator's exhibiting
uncommon foresight.

1200
01:44:44,661 --> 01:44:47,414
We're gonna try and salvage something here today.

1201
01:44:47,581 --> 01:44:50,000
We're gonna work with you on this, Mr. Brubaker.

1202
01:44:50,167 --> 01:44:53,003
Release funds. You can hire people.

1203
01:44:53,170 --> 01:44:56,341
Get you that... boiler.

1204
01:44:57,592 --> 01:45:01,346
We'll sit down and draw up some plans
for some more barracks.

1205
01:45:01,513 --> 01:45:03,389
Get yourself a couple new tractors.

1206
01:45:03,556 --> 01:45:05,851
How many men are buried out there?

1207
01:45:06,435 --> 01:45:08,896
You wouldn't even know, would you?

1208
01:45:09,230 --> 01:45:14,026
That field was an old paupers' graveyard
when my granddaddy was alive.

1209
01:45:14,443 --> 01:45:17,823
- It's a matter of historical record.
- I'm talking about murder.

1210
01:45:18,615 --> 01:45:21,326
It's time to cut through the bull.

1211
01:45:21,493 --> 01:45:24,830
Grave robbery's a felony in this state.

1212
01:45:24,996 --> 01:45:28,876
You don't want to wind up
in your own prison, Mr. Brubaker.

1213
01:45:32,964 --> 01:45:35,967
- He means it.
- I'm calling the governor.

1214
01:45:36,134 --> 01:45:38,971
The governor already knows.

1215
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:52,681
Nobody's asking you to stop digging.

1216
01:45:52,485 --> 01:45:53,987
We're ordering you to.

1217
01:45:54,445 --> 01:45:56,364
I don't like being put in a corner.

1218
01:45:56,531 --> 01:46:00,119
Listen, Edwards, stay out of this.
You're just another token liberal...

1219
01:46:00,286 --> 01:46:04,165
that doesn't know shit.
I was hired to reform this prison.

1220
01:46:04,331 --> 01:46:07,835
If that means putting the prison board
behind bars, I'll do it.

1221
01:46:08,043 --> 01:46:10,922
Already been behind bars, Brubaker.

1222
01:46:11,089 --> 01:46:15,886
Two years in Atlanta for real,
another few days in disguise.

1223
01:46:16,052 --> 01:46:19,682
So you listen to this nice token liberal
for a minute.

1224
01:46:20,016 --> 01:46:22,226
Because you got a high opinion of yourself.

1225
01:46:23,603 --> 01:46:25,480
Most of it I actually agree with.

1226
01:46:25,771 --> 01:46:29,609
But you don't really understand
inmate mentality.

1227
01:46:29,775 --> 01:46:31,487
If you did...

1228
01:46:31,653 --> 01:46:35,782
you'd know that asshole is ready to offer you
anything you need for those men.

1229
01:46:36,492 --> 01:46:38,160
It's not enough.

1230
01:46:38,577 --> 01:46:39,995
Henry...

1231
01:46:40,162 --> 01:46:43,958
stop the digging.
Concentrate on the men who are still alive.

1232
01:46:44,125 --> 01:46:46,544
We are winning. We have leverage now.

1233
01:46:47,295 --> 01:46:50,465
- I've got a prison to run.
- I hope so.

1234
01:48:36,247 --> 01:48:39,585
Bullen! Come over here and bring some guys.

1235
01:48:39,752 --> 01:48:42,796
Zaranska! Elwood! Romeo! Beasley!

1236
01:48:42,963 --> 01:48:44,256
Start digging right here.

1237
01:48:47,051 --> 01:48:48,970
Over there, you see that?

1238
01:49:08,492 --> 01:49:12,371
Hey, Brubaker!
I believe we've got us one.

1239
01:49:19,546 --> 01:49:21,297
Brubaker! Got one in this hole!

1240
01:49:24,884 --> 01:49:27,428
Hold it. Hold it. Careful.

1241
01:49:29,430 --> 01:49:31,934
Okay, careful.
Scoop it out, handful at a time.

1242
01:49:32,434 --> 01:49:35,396
Easy. Spoon it out if you have to!

1243
01:49:35,563 --> 01:49:37,231
Careful. Don't mess up evidence.

1244
01:49:37,398 --> 01:49:40,443
- Got one over here, boss!
- Easy, guys, easy.

1245
01:49:42,571 --> 01:49:44,239
Just carefully pry this off.

1246
01:49:44,406 --> 01:49:47,242
Don't touch anything you find inside.

1247
01:49:50,705 --> 01:49:52,915
Don't touch anything inside.

1248
01:49:55,668 --> 01:49:57,003
Zaranska!

1249
01:49:57,170 --> 01:49:59,255
- All I got is this.
- Here. Hold it.

1250
01:49:59,422 --> 01:50:03,385
- I can't get it! When I move it, it cracks.
- Careful. Careful.

1251
01:50:04,595 --> 01:50:07,097
- Now, don't touch it.
- All right.

1252
01:50:22,489 --> 01:50:25,117
Whole goddamn place has gone crazy.

1253
01:50:25,284 --> 01:50:27,328
They got those guys digging up...

1254
01:50:27,495 --> 01:50:30,664
diseased carcasses of men
dead and rotting for 30 years.

1255
01:50:32,291 --> 01:50:35,295
That is because the man took away
the reason to be smart...

1256
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,589
and have some self-respect.

1257
01:50:37,797 --> 01:50:40,050
Turning the whole damn place upside down.

1258
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:43,804
- Prison board will stop him.
- Bullshit, Floyd!

1259
01:50:45,139 --> 01:50:48,059
They already tried to buy
the dumb bastard, but....

1260
01:50:48,643 --> 01:50:50,311
So...

1261
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:52,605
what do we do?

1262
01:50:55,734 --> 01:50:58,153
What about it, Dickie?

1263
01:50:58,612 --> 01:51:00,989
You got the man's ear.
He want to wake up dead?

1264
01:51:01,156 --> 01:51:04,117
There's talk around here.
I can't control it anymore.

1265
01:51:05,078 --> 01:51:08,456
You know, you're the only one
doing all the talking, Huey.

1266
01:51:14,629 --> 01:51:19,009
Yeah, that's great. And all because one old,
damn deaf fool starts-

1267
01:51:56,675 --> 01:51:59,637
Eddie, come here.

1268
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:08,022
It's time to go.
It's time to check out.

1269
01:52:08,189 --> 01:52:11,192
- Why?
- Why?

1270
01:52:12,568 --> 01:52:15,988
What do you mean?
It's too loose. It's crazy.

1271
01:52:16,155 --> 01:52:19,117
They're digging up bodies.

1272
01:52:19,284 --> 01:52:22,954
It's too late to look up the answer.

1273
01:52:23,538 --> 01:52:26,249
Well, I figure I'm gonna stick around.

1274
01:52:27,167 --> 01:52:29,253
Take my chances here.

1275
01:52:43,727 --> 01:52:45,395
Skull lying under the left arm.

1276
01:52:45,562 --> 01:52:49,441
Both lower leg bones severed from thighs
and stacked in beside the knees.

1277
01:52:49,858 --> 01:52:52,904
The legs appear to have been cut off. Why?

1278
01:52:53,071 --> 01:52:56,324
It's easier to shorten the man
than it is to lengthen the box.

1279
01:52:56,491 --> 01:52:58,284
How long has he been in the ground?

1280
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:01,539
Well, I'm just not a pathologist,
not a coroner-

1281
01:53:01,705 --> 01:53:03,415
Doc, I need some answers fast.

1282
01:53:03,582 --> 01:53:07,253
- Causes of death, dates of death.
- If I took them to the state hospital.

1283
01:53:07,419 --> 01:53:10,089
Do it. Purcell, call the TV stations, newspapers.

1284
01:53:10,256 --> 01:53:13,385
Tell them we just found
four murdered bodies in our pasture.

1285
01:53:13,552 --> 01:53:14,928
There's probably more.

1286
01:53:15,428 --> 01:53:17,889
- You're gonna start a stampede.
- Exactly.

1287
01:53:21,894 --> 01:53:24,272
Mr. Brubaker! Hey, Mr. Brubaker!

1288
01:53:24,438 --> 01:53:26,107
We got a runaway vehicle.

1289
01:53:26,274 --> 01:53:28,234
- And Huey Rauch is in it.
- Huey?

1290
01:53:28,401 --> 01:53:30,736
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

1291
01:53:31,237 --> 01:53:33,031
Well, tell him! He killed Abraham.

1292
01:53:41,123 --> 01:53:43,751
Where would he be?
Where would he go?

1293
01:53:44,127 --> 01:53:45,879
Pinky's.

1294
01:53:46,588 --> 01:53:48,256
Maybe.

1295
01:53:53,596 --> 01:53:54,930
Alive.

1296
01:53:55,097 --> 01:53:57,016
I want him alive.

1297
01:54:21,042 --> 01:54:22,627
Try over there.

1298
01:54:43,900 --> 01:54:47,446
I ain't open yet.
Ain't open for business.

1299
01:54:55,663 --> 01:54:57,082
Hey.

1300
01:54:57,249 --> 01:54:59,918
What the hell's going on here?
You guys crazy?

1301
01:55:02,420 --> 01:55:06,341
- Who you making the sandwiches for?
- Nobody!

1302
01:55:08,970 --> 01:55:10,972
- Where's Huey Rauch?
- Who?

1303
01:55:11,138 --> 01:55:14,267
- Where's your sister at, Pinky?
- What, Carol?

1304
01:55:17,061 --> 01:55:19,523
- Where does that door go?
- My house.

1305
01:55:19,690 --> 01:55:21,316
Open it.

1306
01:55:21,483 --> 01:55:23,527
Door's locked. Ain't been used for years.

1307
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:26,822
I'll go around to the front.

1308
01:55:27,948 --> 01:55:29,826
Hey! This is my castle!

1309
01:55:29,993 --> 01:55:32,620
You can't walk all over me!
I'm calling the law!

1310
01:55:32,787 --> 01:55:34,122
- Then call them.
- I will!

1311
01:55:34,289 --> 01:55:36,207
For now, shut up.

1312
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,275
Hold it!

1313
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:40,844
He's dead.

1314
01:57:41,177 --> 01:57:42,929
He's dead.

1315
01:58:03,327 --> 01:58:07,457
You've examined all the remains in what?
A laboratory environment?

1316
01:58:07,624 --> 01:58:09,292
Yes, I have.

1317
01:58:10,084 --> 01:58:13,296
Dr. Gregory, what about
all these broken bones?

1318
01:58:13,463 --> 01:58:16,883
They may be due to a blunt trauma.
But you need to temper that...

1319
01:58:17,050 --> 01:58:20,095
with the knowledge those fractures
could have occurred...

1320
01:58:20,262 --> 01:58:24,225
several years after death
as a result of a cave-in of the grave walls.

1321
01:58:46,582 --> 01:58:50,003
You don't have to be in practice 20 years
to recognize a skull...

1322
01:58:50,170 --> 01:58:52,631
violently crushed to the size of a grapefruit.

1323
01:58:53,215 --> 01:58:59,012
Son, I have got the forensic expert's report
sitting in front of me here.

1324
01:58:59,179 --> 01:59:04,102
According to all my scientific friends,
who are very knowledgeable in this area...

1325
01:59:04,269 --> 01:59:06,437
it's not all that clear on that point.

1326
01:59:06,604 --> 01:59:09,440
You've got a couple of dozen or so
indigent inmates...

1327
01:59:09,607 --> 01:59:11,860
buried in an old paupers' graveyard.

1328
01:59:12,027 --> 01:59:14,530
Anything else I think is pure speculation.

1329
01:59:14,697 --> 01:59:19,243
Paupers don't die in pieces,
do they, Dr. Gregory?

1330
01:59:19,410 --> 01:59:22,581
I'm gonna put it to you, Mr. Partridge,
that this board...

1331
01:59:22,747 --> 01:59:25,584
is quite capable
of questioning its witnesses.

1332
01:59:25,750 --> 01:59:28,461
And that this whole procedure-

1333
01:59:29,129 --> 01:59:33,426
This whole procedure could just
as easily have been a closed hearing.

1334
01:59:33,593 --> 01:59:37,638
What would be in the best interest
of all concerned and people of this state...

1335
01:59:37,805 --> 01:59:41,183
might be if we could get
Mr. Brubaker's thoughts on his firing.

1336
01:59:41,350 --> 01:59:44,104
Our primary responsibility
at this point in time...

1337
01:59:44,313 --> 01:59:50,027
is, number one, to facilitate the decent
Christian re-interment of the remains.

1338
01:59:50,193 --> 01:59:55,491
Two, to regain control over this institution
that our warden has relinquished!

1339
01:59:55,909 --> 01:59:59,203
We don't go having any more gunfights
in our streets.

1340
01:59:59,370 --> 02:00:00,914
How about that, Mr. Brubaker?

1341
02:00:01,080 --> 02:00:05,169
Any comment on what your thoughts
might be on priority?

1342
02:00:06,962 --> 02:00:08,631
Priority?

1343
02:00:11,133 --> 02:00:14,221
I tried to reach the governor
and give him my thoughts.

1344
02:00:14,387 --> 02:00:18,683
But we all know what a busy man he is.

1345
02:00:18,850 --> 02:00:21,144
I think the board can handle this.

1346
02:00:21,770 --> 02:00:26,442
I was going to suggest that the best way
in the future to prevent any trouble...

1347
02:00:26,609 --> 02:00:30,613
or confusion or a waste
of the taxpayers' time and money...

1348
02:00:30,780 --> 02:00:33,574
would be next time
a man's sentenced to Wakefield...

1349
02:00:33,741 --> 02:00:35,535
take him out and shoot him.

1350
02:00:35,994 --> 02:00:41,541
All right, that's enough!
You stay here and answer to those remarks, mister!

1351
02:00:41,708 --> 02:00:44,002
Miss Gray can explain them.

1352
02:00:44,628 --> 02:00:46,673
I believe you speak the same language.

1353
02:00:52,929 --> 02:00:55,724
- You want me to bring him back?
- No.

1354
02:00:56,976 --> 02:00:58,644
Nobody touches him.

1355
02:01:16,831 --> 02:01:19,208
I figured I hadn't heard the last from you.

1356
02:01:19,375 --> 02:01:23,087
I want to know why you always think
you can just walk out.

1357
02:01:23,254 --> 02:01:25,131
That's murder they're talking about.

1358
02:01:25,298 --> 02:01:29,511
If they condone it, you can't turn around
and tell these men why they're locked up.

1359
02:01:29,678 --> 02:01:31,680
It's one standard for everybody.

1360
02:01:32,848 --> 02:01:35,434
And you don't see any options?
No middle ground?

1361
02:01:35,601 --> 02:01:38,605
No. I don't see playing politics
with the truth, Lillian.

1362
02:01:39,856 --> 02:01:41,566
No way to compromise?

1363
02:01:41,733 --> 02:01:46,029
Oh, on strategy maybe,
but not on principle.

1364
02:01:46,821 --> 02:01:48,365
But that's what I-

1365
02:01:48,532 --> 02:01:52,620
- Goddamn it, I agree with you!
- No, you don't.

1366
02:01:53,913 --> 02:01:55,205
Not really.

1367
02:02:08,678 --> 02:02:12,975
<i>The business of this here prison is farming.</i>

1368
02:02:13,142 --> 02:02:17,521
<i>Not digging up good pastureland
looking for old graveyards.</i>

1369
02:02:18,189 --> 02:02:20,234
<i>What's done is done.</i>

1370
02:02:21,068 --> 02:02:24,613
<i>We got ourselves plenty
to think about today.</i>

1371
02:02:24,780 --> 02:02:27,741
<i>Never mind dwelling about yesterday.</i>

1372
02:02:29,743 --> 02:02:35,375
<i>We all gotta get back
to the basics at hand.</i>

1373
02:02:36,376 --> 02:02:39,963
<i>And that's why I'm standing up here,
saying to you convicts...</i>

1374
02:02:40,129 --> 02:02:44,176
<i>straight out, how Rory Poke
is gonna run this here prison.</i>

1375
02:02:44,426 --> 02:02:49,807
<i>So we won't be wasting any more time
misunderstanding each other.</i>

1376
02:02:52,560 --> 02:02:57,107
<i>I am a firm believer in discipline.</i>

1377
02:02:58,275 --> 02:03:00,569
<i>A convict does his fair share of work...</i>

1378
02:03:00,735 --> 02:03:03,281
<i>and he's not gonna have anything
to worry about.</i>

1379
02:03:03,447 --> 02:03:08,244
<i>But I know that that ain't been happening
around here lately.</i>

1380
02:03:09,954 --> 02:03:12,248
<i>And there ain't no crop...</i>

1381
02:03:13,417 --> 02:03:15,586
<i>in no field...</i>

1382
02:03:15,794 --> 02:03:19,339
<i>at no prison that I'm in charge of...</i>

1383
02:03:19,506 --> 02:03:21,466
<i>that's gonna die in the fields.</i>

1384
02:03:22,342 --> 02:03:27,390
<i>The trusties will divide you up
into work groups.</i>

1385
02:03:27,599 --> 02:03:29,642
<i>You listen now.</i>

1386
02:03:29,809 --> 02:03:32,395
<i>Give them trouble,
and they've got my permission...</i>

1387
02:03:32,562 --> 02:03:36,066
<i>to see to it that the troublemaker is punished.</i>

1388
02:03:36,317 --> 02:03:37,818
<i>Hard.</i>

1389
02:03:38,444 --> 02:03:41,530
<i>Fair, but hard.</i>

1390
02:03:41,697 --> 02:03:44,325
I packed up all your personal things
I could find.

1391
02:03:44,492 --> 02:03:48,830
If I've missed anything or you have any mail,
I'll take care of it.

1392
02:03:50,498 --> 02:03:51,833
Don't worry.

1393
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:58,090
Hey, Brubaker.

1394
02:04:00,259 --> 02:04:02,762
I'm getting ready to tell you something.

1395
02:04:04,188 --> 02:04:08,943
<i>All of you here,
every damn one of you...</i>

1396
02:04:09,026 --> 02:04:11,904
<i>is gonna receive equal justice...</i>

1397
02:04:12,356 --> 02:04:14,024
You were right.

1398
02:04:14,691 --> 02:04:17,737
<i>I don't believe it makes no sense...</i>

1399
02:04:17,904 --> 02:04:21,616
<i>having some convicts
looking more important than others.</i>

1400
02:04:22,033 --> 02:04:26,664
<i>Trusties is the only kind of men
that's earned...</i>

1401
02:04:29,333 --> 02:04:33,837
<i>That's what you're gonna discover
Rory Poke is all about.</i>

1402
02:04:34,088 --> 02:04:37,217
<i>Earning your privileges.</i>

1403
02:04:37,884 --> 02:04:43,598
<i>There ain't gonna be no more warden
playing favorites at Wakefield.</i>

1404
02:04:44,099 --> 02:04:47,310
<i>Ain't gonna be no more inmate council.</i>

1405
02:04:48,229 --> 02:04:52,900
<i>You've gotta earn privileges from now on.</i>

1406
02:05:00,242 --> 02:05:02,744
<i>That convict in the rear there.
Get back in line!</i>

1407
02:05:02,911 --> 02:05:04,871
<i>Get back into formation!</i>

1408
02:05:05,247 --> 02:05:07,708
<i>You men! You-! Get back in line!</i>

1409
02:05:07,874 --> 02:05:10,878
<i>Get back into formation!
You'll get a taste of the strap!</i>

1410
02:05:24,602 --> 02:05:25,853
<i>What the hell-?</i>
