1
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:06,623
I'm inviting you for breakfast.

2
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:14,715
I can't. I have to go to church.

3
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,092
Well, after church, then.

4
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,054
Come on,
we haven't seen you for so long.

5
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,560
Why don't you put this on, please, I...

6
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,347
I don't want your
little baby to get sick.

7
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,642
It's so cold out.

8
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,065
- Come on.
- OK.

9
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:42,030
OK?

10
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,532
Hmm?

11
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,867
You'll come?

12
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,541
Oh, yeah.

13
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,870
Great.

14
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,419
- Could you put the whole thing on?
- Oh, yeah.

15
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,675
See you.

16
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,190
- You owe me five dollars.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:23,863
Well, not till he's
sitting at the table,

18
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,370
I don't owe you anything, there, baby.

19
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,499
Something's going on with him.
I'm worried.

20
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,870
Well, you keep saying that.
I think your...

21
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,707
I think your maternal instincts
might be kicking in.

22
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,473
<i>In all the world,</i>

23
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:51,138
there are books and books
and books of laws.

24
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:55,604
But in all this world,
there really is only one law.

25
00:03:57,195 --> 00:04:01,189
We need never ask,
"Lord, what should I do?"

26
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,072
Because the Lord has told us what to do.

27
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:08,280
Love one another.

28
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,334
That, my friends, is the one true law.

29
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,668
Love is God in action.

30
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,422
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
the love of God,

31
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,839
the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
be with you all now and forever more.

32
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,091
- Amen.
- Amen.

33
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:33,854
- That was a nice service, dear.
- That was nice, yes.

34
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,603
Hi, Mrs. Gruner.
Do you want some help?

35
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,769
Oh, thank you, dear.

36
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:42,526
It's my turn
to drop them off at the hospital.

37
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,860
Yeah.

38
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:49,199
You know,
you're a good-looking fellow, Lars.

39
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:52,706
- Where's your girlfriend?
- I don't have one.

40
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:54,287
- Are you gay?
- No.

41
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,919
My grandson's gay.
I know all about the gays.

42
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:59,250
Yeah, I know, but I'm not gay, so...

43
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,043
Well, don't leave it too long.
It's not good for you.

44
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,381
OK.

45
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,547
Here.

46
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,385
Give this to somebody nice. For a start.

47
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,102
Hello, Lars.

48
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,250
I guess...
I'll see you at work tomorrow.

49
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,206
Yeah, OK, bye.

50
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,550
Karin, my brother is 27 years old.
Maybe he wants to be left alone.

51
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:49,134
- That's not what he wants.
- Oh, really? Hey. Go.

52
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:54,018
- How do you know that, exactly?
- Because that's not how people are.

53
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,647
Oh, there he goes.

54
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,988
Lars! Come on, you promised!

55
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,203
- Is that normal?
- Five dollars.

56
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,788
- Morning.
- Good morning, Cindy.

57
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,877
Did you have a nice weekend?

58
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,885
That new girl's kind of cute, huh?

59
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,384
You and Margo, what do you think?

60
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:26,607
Lars, Lars, you gotta see this.

61
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,488
I'm not really in the mood
for porn this morning.

62
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,194
It's not porn.

63
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,698
OK, it is, but check it out, all right?

64
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,206
Huh? You like?

65
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,117
Man, they're solid.

66
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,038
Like, if she'd weigh 125 pounds,
then she weighs 125 pounds.

67
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,081
- Is that right?
- You can customize everything.

68
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,376
They got all these different heads
and parts.

69
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,886
You can design your own woman.

70
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,180
- And, Lars?
- Uh-huh.

71
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,683
- Lars.
- Yeah.

72
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,971
They're anatomically correct.

73
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:11,735
- You're not going to buy one, are you?
- I wish.

74
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,368
Look how much they cost.
I'm wiped out from the new Xbox.

75
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,782
Morning.

76
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,246
- Morning.
- Oh, hey! Yeah. Morning.

77
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,037
Margo's here, everybody. Hurray.

78
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,214
Could you put the headset on?

79
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:42,261
Hey, I was thinking,
we're the only ones from the lake.

80
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,180
We could carpool.

81
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:49,394
- Lars, it's your day for coffee, buddy.
- Oh, yeah.

82
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,531
You know what your problem is, Margo?
You're just too aggressive.

83
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,946
Just chillax, you know.

84
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,410
Shut up.

85
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,296
Wait! Stop! Stop!

86
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,760
Karin!

87
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:18,135
What? What?

88
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,600
We want you to come for dinner.

89
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,304
Will you come?

90
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,443
- You scared me.
- Sorry.

91
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:39,201
- You scared me.
- Oh, sweetheart, sorry.

92
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,495
Wait.

93
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,453
- It's OK. I can't. I can't.
- Wait, why not? No!

94
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,328
Why not? Come on, Lars, we miss you.

95
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,834
Yeah.

96
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:57,546
I brought my work home so I have to...
I'll get in trouble.

97
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,054
No, you didn't.

98
00:09:59,224 --> 00:10:01,181
Yeah. Did you hear that?
That's my phone I think.

99
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,890
No. Come on! Wait! Wait!
Lars, stop! Stop!

100
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,104
- Come on, please?
- I have other plans.

101
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,520
- No.
- And I can't.

102
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:18,028
Lars, there's salmon
and cherry pie in there.

103
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,655
- Could you please let me go?
- No.

104
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,825
OK.

105
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:47,220
- Is that all you can eat?
- Yeah, that was delicious. Thank you.

106
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:48,854
- No, no, you stay there.
- No, I can take...

107
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,060
No, it's my turn.

108
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,850
You boys talk.

109
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:04,529
OK, Karin's been worried about you.

110
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:09,326
She thinks you've got a problem because
you spend so much time by yourself.

111
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,755
- I'm fine.
- That's what I told her.

112
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,759
- Exactly what I said.
- OK.

113
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,429
Dad was kind of like that, too, so...

114
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:27,268
Yeah, but he didn't really want
anyone around, so that's the difference.

115
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,771
That's not true.

116
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,278
OK, you know, yeah, sure,
maybe after Mom died.

117
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,485
But, you know,
you didn't know him before that.

118
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,577
I mean, not that you could have,
but, I'm just saying.

119
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,678
Karin and I would really like it
if you moved in.

120
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:07,012
Oh, that's... No, that's OK. Thank you.

121
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:11,145
- The house is half yours.
- Yeah, I know that. I'm fine. Thanks.

122
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,352
Just putting it out there.

123
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,322
- Well, good night. Sleep tight.
- Good night.

124
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,651
Oh, wait.
Here are some leftovers for you.

125
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:28,996
- Do you have my blanket?
- Oh, yeah.

126
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,656
- I'll get it. I'll get it.
- It's on the...

127
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,119
- Grab these.
- Thanks.

128
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,704
I'll be right back.

129
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,673
It's a beautiful blanket.

130
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:42,209
- Gus says your mother made it for you.
- Yeah.

131
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,003
When she was pregnant.

132
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,516
Well, she must have loved you very much.

133
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,014
Like we do.

134
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,357
- Are you mad at me?
- Is he coming?

135
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:05,194
- Here we go. Good night.
- Thanks, good night.

136
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:16,460
What? We talked. He's fine.

137
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,087
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Lars. It's Karin.</i>

138
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:04,876
<i>They just delivered a huge box for you.
It's in the garage.</i>

139
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:09,964
<i>- Oh, OK. Thanks.
- OK, bye.</i>

140
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,307
Thanks.

141
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,826
That's a nice sweater.

142
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,172
Hey. Come on in.

143
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:40,562
That's OK.
Is Karin gonna come to the door?

144
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,348
- Karin.
- Yeah?

145
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:45,734
Honey, come here. It's Lars.

146
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:48,441
- Really?
- Yeah.

147
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,864
She's just doing some kind of a...

148
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,744
It's pregnant women's yoga.

149
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:58,363
So...

150
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,368
No, it's good. It's good, good stuff.

151
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,127
- Hey.
- Hi.

152
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,413
What's up?

153
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,217
I have a visitor.

154
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,842
- You have a...
- In the garage?

155
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:16,723
- Now?
- Yeah.

156
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,850
A visitor?

157
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,977
That's great.

158
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,222
Yeah.

159
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,400
- And she's not from here.
- She?

160
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,690
Yeah.

161
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,942
Wow. What do you... What do you...
What do you know? Where...

162
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:37,486
- Where did you meet this person?
- On the Internet.

163
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,497
Yeah, well, everybody's doing that now.

164
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,158
That's great!

165
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:46,249
She doesn't speak much English, though.

166
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,004
It's OK.

167
00:16:48,174 --> 00:16:50,837
It's really the same
with the guys at work, it's...

168
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,002
- It's not that big a deal.
- OK.

169
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:57,551
Well, yeah.
Well, you know, she's in a wheelchair.

170
00:16:57,725 --> 00:17:00,183
So I just don't want her
to feel weird about it.

171
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,436
- Oh, no. No.
- So what? We don't care.

172
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:03,686
OK.

173
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:08,146
And I have to ask you a really...
I know that it's a really big favor.

174
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,102
Yeah.

175
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,985
Well, she's just really religious

176
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:17,242
and because we're both young and single,

177
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:20,449
it just doesn't feel right for us to
stay in the garage alone together.

178
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,364
Oh, no. We'll put her
in the pink room.

179
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:23,749
No. She can sleep here.

180
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:25,409
- In the pink room?
- Yeah.

181
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:28,750
- OK.
- Sure. And there are new towels.

182
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:37,300
Just give us half an hour to, you know,
pick up and get something in the oven.

183
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,965
- Okey-dokey.
- Get the place ready.

184
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,939
- OK. Let's get started.
- All right.

185
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,020
Man, that is...

186
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:55,488
You quiet ones are...
You know what they say about the...

187
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,944
It's great. It's great.
See you in a little bit.

188
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,908
- OK.
- OK.

189
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,646
You know, Bianca's a missionary.

190
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:32,142
Well, was a missionary. Right. Sorry.
Because she was raised by nuns.

191
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,063
But now she's on a sabbatical
so she can experience the world.

192
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,026
Isn't that neat?

193
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,366
She's shy.

194
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,699
Well, you are.

195
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:53,543
Everything's so new for her. Right?

196
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:02,347
- Are you hungry?
- We're starving.

197
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,553
Gus, will you give me a hand
in the kitchen?

198
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,893
How was that?

199
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,271
I know.

200
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,703
Oh, my God!

201
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,331
I mean, so, he's crazy, right?
I mean, he's crazy.

202
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,742
- Shh.
- Karin...

203
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,748
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

204
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,754
Huh? What are we gonna do?

205
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,843
Oh, my God! He's... Karin!

206
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,095
We're gonna have to
put him in a hospital, I think.

207
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,256
We're gonna have to put him in a
hospital. I can't afford that.

208
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,594
Karin, I can't believe this.

209
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,511
My little brother
is totally, totally insane!

210
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:49,769
- Pull yourself together.
- How am I...

211
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,726
Gus! Calm down!

212
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,015
How are we gonna
pull ourselves together?

213
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:56,105
- Calm down, OK? Now!
- He's talking to a doll, baby.

214
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,941
We're just gonna get
through this somehow, OK?

215
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,777
I just don't know how
we're gonna do it.

216
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,909
I don't, either. But you gotta be calm.

217
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,616
- OK?
- OK.

218
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,707
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

219
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,336
Karin. Karin! She's not gonna eat!

220
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,822
So, you're never gonna believe this.

221
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,493
It makes me mad,
but Bianca's from the tropics.

222
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,667
She... Well, she's Brazilian.

223
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:02,167
Well, half Brazilian,
half Danish, that's right.

224
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:07,048
And somebody stole her luggage.

225
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,185
- Oh?
- Yeah, and they stole her wheelchair.

226
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,933
That's terrible.

227
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,353
Yeah. Can you believe that, Gus?

228
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,944
- Yeah, I can't believe it.
- Right.

229
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,493
Well, it makes me angry.

230
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:31,363
Anyway...

231
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,207
I wanted to ask you a favor.

232
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:38,085
She doesn't mind. I promise.

233
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,622
Karin, you don't mind
lending Bianca some clothes, do you?

234
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,883
She doesn't have any.

235
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,227
Do you?

236
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,265
I'm not sure we're the same type, Lars.

237
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:02,231
Well, that's OK, Karin,
because Bianca doesn't really care

238
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,817
about superficial things like that,
so it's OK.

239
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,416
- Sure.
- Yeah, that's...

240
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,668
See, I told you.

241
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,587
Thanks.

242
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:25,588
Well, this used to be my mom's room.

243
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:31,428
So, if you need anything,
Gus and Karin are right across the hall.

244
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,804
I'm in the garage.

245
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,392
You know that. So, what else?

246
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,558
Your towels are brand new,
thanks to Karin.

247
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:47,231
Lars, I think we should go to bed,
you know?

248
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:48,649
OK.

249
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,781
Just, you know, one second.

250
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:56,536
I just wanted to say
that I'm so glad you're finally here.

251
00:22:57,501 --> 00:23:00,289
Lars, I think right now would...

252
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,462
Yeah. OK, good night.

253
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,052
Wait. Gus had a good idea.

254
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:21,143
He's... He's concerned
about Bianca's health.

255
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,895
You know, just with the traveling

256
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,935
and the change of climate
and everything.

257
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,446
Well, it's stress, you know.

258
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,279
I'll make an appointment
with Dr. Berman for tomorrow.

259
00:23:32,453 --> 00:23:34,991
- For early tomorrow.
- We'll all go.

260
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,865
Yeah. You remember Dagmar.

261
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:40,325
OK.

262
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:43,836
- You think that's a good idea?
- I do. I think we should do it.

263
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,420
Yeah. That's a good idea
because I was gonna go

264
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,802
- shopping for wheelchairs anyway.
- Let's just go to bed.

265
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,679
- So, good night.
- Night.

266
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,181
I'll see you tomorrow.

267
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:45,724
Oh, my God!

268
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,464
<i>Natasha escaped from Moscow</i>

269
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,376
<i>where she was forced
to strip for the Russian mob.</i>

270
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,259
<i>Now all she wants
is an all-American male to love.</i>

271
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:19,391
<i>Midori left a high-paying job in Tokyo</i>

272
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,428
<i>because she was unsatisfied as a woman.</i>

273
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:26,439
<i>Tammy dropped out of high school
to join the rodeo.</i>

274
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:30,443
<i>Are you the right cowboy
to tame this wild filly?</i>

275
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,577
The doctor will tell us what to do.

276
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,834
But she's family practice.
We're gonna need a shrink.

277
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,796
No, she is, she's a psychologist, too.

278
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:56,632
Oh.

279
00:25:57,473 --> 00:26:00,216
She says you have to be, this far north.

280
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,642
What'll people think?

281
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,981
We can't worry about that.

282
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,815
Right.

283
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,548
Right there is where
my dad used to work.

284
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,469
Our dad.

285
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,674
That's the library.

286
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,559
I have a card
and you can borrow it if you want to.

287
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:49,689
Well, actually, I'll have to take them
out for you, but you just tell me...

288
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,475
Oh, I don't know.

289
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:56,613
I don't know, actually.
Gus, what was it that Dad did?

290
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,199
Water and power.

291
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,419
My job's at the school department.

292
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,135
I miss everybody,
but there's so much to do in the house.

293
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:23,218
I'll go back just as soon
as the baby's old enough and you're...

294
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,778
Yeah, sure.

295
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,453
<i>Readers Digest</i>

296
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,831
<i>Midwest Living or Country Home?</i>

297
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:52,251
That's what I would say.

298
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:09,598
Well, her blood pressure's low.

299
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:18,110
- Is that serious?
- Could be. We'll have to wait and see.

300
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:23,774
It's fine.

301
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:27,738
Mine's probably low, too.

302
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:39,374
I want you to bring her in every week
for special treatment.

303
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,460
Can you do that?

304
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:49,601
Yeah. Are you sure
that that's necessary?

305
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,641
Yes.

306
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,976
OK. OK.

307
00:28:56,026 --> 00:28:57,312
What do you think?

308
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,779
Well, if that's what she says,
then we should.

309
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:03,697
OK.

310
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,409
You can set that up with Joanne
at the desk.

311
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,661
I look forward
to getting to know you, Bianca.

312
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,585
Karin, I'm telling you,
he belongs in a hospital.

313
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,796
No! My Uncle Garth
went to one of those places

314
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,131
and he never came back.

315
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,466
Yeah, but he needs more help
than you and I are able to give him.

316
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,597
I told you something was wrong
and you wouldn't listen!

317
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,180
If I may...

318
00:29:31,937 --> 00:29:36,352
Has Lars been functional?
Does he go to work, wash, dress himself?

319
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:37,765
So far.

320
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,903
Has he had any violent episodes?

321
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:46,316
Oh, no. No, never. He's a sweetheart.
He never even raises his voice.

322
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:49,486
OK. We gotta fix him. Can you fix him?

323
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,030
I don't know, Gus.

324
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:57,035
I don't believe
he's psychotic or schizophrenic.

325
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,377
I don't think this is caused by genes
or faulty wiring in the brain.

326
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:03,542
So then what the hell
is going on, then?

327
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,678
- He appears to have a delusion.
- A delusion?

328
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:10,223
What the hell is he doing
with a delusion, for Christ's sake?

329
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:12,884
That's what we have to find out.

330
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,395
Chances are he's been
decompensating for some time.

331
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,225
Guess we didn't realize.

332
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,908
Have there been any changes
in the family in the last year or so?

333
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,159
No, everything is pretty much
exactly the same

334
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,948
except that Karin is pregnant
and Lars is nuts.

335
00:30:34,708 --> 00:30:37,576
You know,
this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

336
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:41,838
What we call mental illness
isn't always just an illness.

337
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:46,798
It can be a communication,
it can be a way to work something out.

338
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,805
- Fantastic. When will it be over?
- When he doesn't need it anymore.

339
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,763
How can we help?

340
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,521
- Go along with it.
- Oh, no. No, that's... No.

341
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:05,607
Oh, my. No, no, no. No.

342
00:31:05,781 --> 00:31:09,365
No, I mean, pretend that she's real?
I'm not gonna do that. I mean, I can't.

343
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,571
- I'm just not gonna do it.
- She is real.

344
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,863
- Well...
- I mean, she's right out there.

345
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,783
Right, right. I get that.
But I'm just not gonna...

346
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:19,791
You know, I'm just not gonna...
I'm not gonna do it, so...

347
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,453
You won't be able
to change his mind, anyway.

348
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:24,122
Bianca's in town for a reason.

349
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,042
- Right, but, but...
- It's not really a choice.

350
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:34,550
OK. OK. All right, then, we'll do it.
Whatever it takes.

351
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,969
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And everyone's gonna laugh at him.

352
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,013
And you.

353
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:55,031
She loves kids.

354
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,788
Yeah.

355
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,079
<i>- More coffee, Lars?
- Yes, please.</i>

356
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,049
You want to see a funny face?

357
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,631
Does Bianca want some?

358
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,630
Yeah.

359
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,183
- There we go.
- Thank you, Karin.

360
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,595
Gus? No. OK.

361
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,017
Yeah, sure.

362
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:31,197
You're not gonna go to work today, Gus?

363
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:35,990
- I don't feel good.
- Oh, no.

364
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,874
Well, Bianca could help you, you know.
She has nurse's training.

365
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,875
No, she doesn't.

366
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:47,880
She doesn't have nurse's training, Lars,
because she's not a person.

367
00:32:48,717 --> 00:32:50,458
She's a big plastic thing.

368
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,216
That's amazing.

369
00:32:56,183 --> 00:32:57,719
Did you hear that?

370
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,553
Bianca just said that
that's why God made her, to help people.

371
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:13,196
Are you gonna be late?

372
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:14,652
For work?

373
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,034
I am gonna be late.

374
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,950
Oh, no, I have to go. OK.

375
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:28,838
- Bye-bye. I'm going to check in.
- Okey-doke.

376
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,124
And you have my number at work,
right, Karin?

377
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,462
Yep.

378
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,260
I wanted to tell you
that you look really pretty today.

379
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,941
I hope that you feel better, Gus.

380
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,352
Me, too.

381
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,238
- And thanks so much for breakfast.
- No.

382
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:57,275
- OK, gotta go. Bye!
- See you.

383
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,289
Well, I had to try, you know?

384
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:08,160
What? What? What?

385
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,295
It's just...

386
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,582
I don't know.

387
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,553
It's true. We've been all wrapped up
in ourselves. We have, Gus.

388
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,056
This is not my fault, though.
It's not my fault.

389
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,893
Come on, Bianca,
let's make a couple of calls.

390
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,744
Good morning, Cindy.
You look really pretty today.

391
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:52,163
Thank you. Oh, Mr. Sunshine.

392
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:59,964
It's way in advance, but you know
how excited I get about these things.

393
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,846
All right, where are they?
I know you took them.

394
00:35:09,024 --> 00:35:10,936
- Did not.
- You did, too. As revenge.

395
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,647
- For what?
- For the fake rat I put in your drawer.

396
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,901
Oh, that.

397
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,939
Lars, I'm missing
three of my action figures.

398
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,484
It's your turn to get coffee.

399
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,573
OK, listen up, Margo.

400
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:25,739
Those action figures
are extremely important to me.

401
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:27,372
All right? They're worth a lot of money.

402
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,875
If I don't see every damn one
back on my desk pretty soon,

403
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,413
then you can tell your teddy bear
to watch his back.

404
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,972
I'll return them. One at a time.

405
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:55,860
- You going to Cindy's party?
- Oh, no.

406
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:01,698
I was hoping you would.
I really wish you would.

407
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,869
Well, maybe.

408
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,531
That'd be great.

409
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,916
Do you think
I could bring my girlfriend?

410
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:17,999
Oh... Yeah, yeah, I mean,
I'm totally bringing somebody.

411
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:29,223
- Wow!
- I didn't know there were sex dolls.

412
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,103
Love dolls. That's what they call them.

413
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,481
I saw a special on cable.

414
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:37,485
So are you serious?
Bianca really has a...

415
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,899
So she's really just
one of the girls, then.

416
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,902
I'm sorry.

417
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,124
No way!

418
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:00,212
Does she have a sister?

419
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,462
Wish I had a woman that couldn't talk.

420
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:10,259
It's not that funny.
It's not that funny.

421
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,144
We don't want anything to do with her.

422
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,225
She's a golden calf.

423
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:15,981
And we all know what happened with that.

424
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,768
He's not worshipping her,
they're just dating.

425
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,153
These young people have no willpower.

426
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,655
He's sick, all right? He's sick.

427
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,283
I guess, we were just hoping,
if we came to you,

428
00:37:26,453 --> 00:37:29,662
you could help, you know,
just pave the way a little.

429
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:32,448
If you could just
try to understand, it's...

430
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,116
- He is a nice man.
- We can try.

431
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:36,377
I don't even know why we're here.
This is absurd.

432
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:39,505
Oh, for heaven's sake,
what's the big deal?

433
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:44,002
Sally, your cousin
puts dresses on his cats.

434
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:49,348
Hazel, your nephew
gave all his money to a UFO club.

435
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,639
And, Arnie, everybody knows
your first wife was a klepto.

436
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:53,768
She wasn't.

437
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,850
Then why is she buried
in a pair of my earrings?

438
00:37:56,274 --> 00:38:00,109
- Now, that's enough.
- These things happen.

439
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:03,900
Lars is a good boy.

440
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,276
You can depend on me.

441
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,995
Thanks, Mrs. Gruner.

442
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:16,455
Well, he's not bringing her to church,
now, is he, Reverend Bock?

443
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:18,453
Well...

444
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:22,794
...the question is, as always...

445
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,214
What would Jesus do?

446
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:35,265
<i>Holy, Holy, Holy</i>

447
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:39,899
<i>Merciful and mighty!</i>

448
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:44,358
<i>God in three persons</i>

449
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:48,115
<i>Blessed Trinity!</i>

450
00:38:54,082 --> 00:38:56,290
I would like to take the opportunity

451
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,294
to welcome all of our new visitors
to our church today.

452
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:04,962
Bianca, it's good to see you.
Lars, God bless.

453
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:06,625
God bless. God bless.

454
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,795
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome, my dear.

455
00:39:08,972 --> 00:39:10,088
Getting close.

456
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:12,177
- Well...
- Be careful. Watch yourself.

457
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,930
These are for you, Bianca.

458
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,764
Thank you.

459
00:39:20,942 --> 00:39:22,899
Bianca, this is my friend, Mrs. Gruner.

460
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,733
She has a darling figure.

461
00:39:31,286 --> 00:39:32,572
Those are nice, huh?

462
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,658
They're not real, so they last forever.
Isn't that neat?

463
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,582
Hello.

464
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,378
Get back here!

465
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,658
There we go.

466
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,040
OK, watch your head on the way in.

467
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,872
Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.
There we go.

468
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,506
Are you comfortable? Yeah?

469
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,293
I'll get the chair.

470
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,678
Oh, can you put her seatbelt on?

471
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,181
Bianca, Gus is gonna
put on your seatbelt, OK?

472
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,014
Oh, can you put that on her legs,
'cause she gets cold.

473
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,849
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

474
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,528
Thanks, Gus.

475
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:58,032
Yeah, where are you guys...

476
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,367
Where are you going?

477
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,372
Just one second.

478
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,506
She doesn't know, it's a secret.
But I can tell you.

479
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:11,254
It's just that she's asking me
all these questions all the time

480
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:12,838
and she wants to know
everything about me,

481
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:17,598
so I thought that I would take her
to the lake where we used to play.

482
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,554
Yeah.

483
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,559
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

484
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,604
It sounds... Yeah, that sounds nice.

485
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:27,729
Yeah. Gotta go.

486
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,069
I'm coming. Why are you yelling?

487
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:57,387
Gus and his friends used to
come up here all the time.

488
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,890
In the summer, they'd go fishing.

489
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,268
In the winter, they'd play hockey.

490
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:08,441
They'd build all kinds of cool forts,
and, like, they'd build snow forts...

491
00:42:09,277 --> 00:42:10,939
Watch your head.

492
00:42:11,863 --> 00:42:15,106
Here we go. There.

493
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:18,151
Is this OK? You OK? OK?

494
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,784
OK, this is the tree house,

495
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:24,745
and we have a rope swing and a ladder.

496
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,275
You should watch me chop wood, too.

497
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,362
I'm really good at it.

498
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,040
I'm sorry.

499
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,707
I couldn't wait any longer.
I wanted to see how she was doing.

500
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:59,547
Well, after the treatment,
she has to rest.

501
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,053
It doesn't work
without the resting.

502
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,596
Keep me company.

503
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:09,682
Lars, keep me company.

504
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:22,991
Do you know how many sessions
she's gonna have to have?

505
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:29,244
No, I don't.
It's a tricky illness, Lars.

506
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:36,130
But, you know, what I could use
is a more complete history on her,

507
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:39,963
- like, parents...
- Oh, they died when she was a baby.

508
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,878
Well, that's not fair.

509
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:47,390
Yeah, but she doesn't feel
sorry for herself or anything.

510
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,395
She just wants to be normal,
have everyone treat her normal.

511
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,141
That's nice.

512
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,231
- I admire that.
- Yeah, me, too.

513
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:02,273
- Is that your husband?
- Yes. He died.

514
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:04,400
Oh, no.

515
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:07,244
I'm sorry.

516
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,077
- Do you have kids?
- No.

517
00:45:16,631 --> 00:45:18,714
You must get really lonely.

518
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:23,253
Sometimes I get so lonely I forget
what day it is and how to spell my name.

519
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,929
How about you?

520
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,809
You're funny.

521
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:40,319
So what's the difference between
a delusion and a hallucination?

522
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,281
It's false perception
versus false belief.

523
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,192
OK, so when Moose thinks
the FBI's after him...

524
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:49,032
- The EEA.
- INS.

525
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:51,822
IRS, ATF, AAA.

526
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:55,663
- Right, that would be a delusion.
- No, dude, they are after us.

527
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,032
What are we doing?
Why are we doing this for him?

528
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,576
Oh, come on.

529
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,624
It's funny.

530
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,290
Is it?

531
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:49,801
I don't know.
I don't know, maybe not.

532
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,019
<i>So tell me about Karin.</i>

533
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:00,648
I don't know her very well.

534
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,935
Oh, she's wonderful.

535
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:06,355
Gus and I are both very lucky
with women. She's wonderful.

536
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,533
But she...

537
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,000
We don't have to talk.
Let's find you something to read.

538
00:47:18,169 --> 00:47:19,785
No, it's just...

539
00:47:21,005 --> 00:47:22,962
- Between us.
- Of course.

540
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,759
I'm worried about her.

541
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:34,012
- I think she has a little problem.
- Oh, maybe you shouldn't tell me.

542
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:36,177
No, it's OK. It's just...

543
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,436
And I think it's 'cause she's insecure,

544
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,444
but she's just always trying
to hug everybody.

545
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:49,698
You know, some people don't like that.
Some people don't like to be hugged.

546
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:54,111
But she doesn't realize that,
she takes it personally and thinks...

547
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:57,281
You know, it hurts her feelings.

548
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,786
I don't know what to do about that.

549
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,464
Do you?

550
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:11,174
But it's such a comfort sometimes
just to have somebody's arms around you.

551
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:13,009
Don't you think?

552
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,135
No.

553
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,925
Come on, it feels good.

554
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,437
It does not feel good, it hurts.

555
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,143
Oh.

556
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:27,110
Like a cut or a bruise or...

557
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:31,614
Like a burn. Like when you
go outside and your feet freeze

558
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:35,323
and then you come back in
and they thaw out? It's like that.

559
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,493
It's almost exactly like that.

560
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,158
Same with everybody?

561
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,171
Well, not really with Bianca.

562
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,589
But everyone else.

563
00:48:51,846 --> 00:48:53,678
So you don't let people touch you?

564
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,014
Lars, isn't that hard to get away with?

565
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:02,433
No, not really, here,
'cause I have all these layers.

566
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:05,898
And that helps.

567
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,027
Look, we can't change Karin.

568
00:49:11,115 --> 00:49:14,028
But I can help you.

569
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,825
That's fine.

570
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:31,587
- Pain?
- Yeah, but I can take it.

571
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,561
You OK?

572
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:44,721
Uh-huh.

573
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:50,819
- Well, that's enough for today.
- Yeah. Thanks.

574
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:57,901
What?

575
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,696
Yeah, I'm OK.

576
00:50:11,467 --> 00:50:14,676
Well, it's scientifically proven

577
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,804
that everyone's favorite word
is their own name,

578
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:22,764
so if you just say their names a lot...

579
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,678
You OK?

580
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,024
You can see
that it's gonna make them happy.

581
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:50,958
Yeah.

582
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,638
Mr. Sunshine!

583
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,270
And this must be Bianca.
Well, welcome.

584
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:09,146
Welcome, come on in.

585
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:19,653
I have my boots on
but I brought my shoes.

586
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,616
Don't worry about it.
Baxter? Baxter, baby.

587
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:25,655
Lars, this is my husband.

588
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,746
Hi, Lars.

589
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,372
Bianca.

590
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,666
How are you?

591
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,381
Is that for me, Bianca?

592
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:41,425
Thank you.

593
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,519
Can Baxter get you two
something to drink from the kitchen?

594
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,905
Lars?

595
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:03,860
I'll have a beer.

596
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:07,242
And for Bianca?

597
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:10,997
She doesn't drink.

598
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,538
She doesn't like it when I drink,
either, but I'm just gonna have one.

599
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,675
I can help you with your coats.

600
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,348
This is Margo, and this is Bianca.

601
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:28,218
Hi. Hi, Bianca.

602
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:36,188
I'm glad you sent around that memo.
I would have freaked.

603
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,527
It's so bizarre.

604
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:42,407
- It's a disorder.
- What a weirdo.

605
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,696
Lars?

606
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,744
Look at him.

607
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,406
He's in love
with that slutty hunk of silicone.

608
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:51,700
Her name's Bianca.

609
00:52:51,877 --> 00:52:54,961
- Does he have sex with her?
- Babe, that's what she's for, yeah.

610
00:52:56,757 --> 00:52:58,840
So, I hear you guys are getting married.

611
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,250
- Yes.
- No.

612
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,470
Tickle fight!

613
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,102
I would kill to have hair like hers.

614
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:19,064
Oh, I'd cut it, like, to here.
Long in front, short in back.

615
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,939
Lars would never let her cut it.

616
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,857
Guys and long hair.

617
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:27,410
I don't care.

618
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,873
However she likes it,
that's how I like it.

619
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:34,288
That's my kind of guy.

620
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:37,746
I need wine.

621
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,790
I'll get it.

622
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,627
Anyone else?

623
00:53:43,804 --> 00:53:45,966
- Oh, no. No, thanks.
- No.

624
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,031
Hey, chief.

625
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:09,740
Oh, hey, Lars. Bianca? Total babe.

626
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:12,538
Thanks.

627
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:16,201
Best thing is, man,
she doesn't even know how hot she is.

628
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,789
That's what you want in a woman.

629
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:21,206
They stay with you 'cause they don't
know they could get somebody better.

630
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:23,249
Know what I'm saying?

631
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:26,677
Hey, is she... flexible?

632
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,188
Yes.

633
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,811
Did you have fun?

634
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,031
Yeah.

635
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:20,283
I'm just happy, that's all.

636
00:56:29,303 --> 00:56:32,887
"And so he solaced himself with
pacing up and down the little meadow,

637
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,264
and writing and carving
on the bark of the trees

638
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:38,427
and on the fine sand
a multitude of verses,

639
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:42,518
all in harmony with his sadness,
and some in praise of Dulcinea.

640
00:57:02,794 --> 00:57:04,330
But what distressed him greatly

641
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:07,167
was not having another hermit there
to confess him."

642
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,075
Pain?

643
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:38,703
It's OK.

644
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,656
That's OK, I can take that.

645
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:47,663
You must be excited
about a baby on the way.

646
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:49,956
Uh-huh.

647
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,670
Don't you want to be an uncle?

648
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:06,560
- Do you ever want to be a mom?
- I don't know.

649
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,404
Yes.

650
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,790
But I'm not able
to have children of my own.

651
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,079
That's too bad.

652
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,934
Bianca's like that, actually.

653
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:52,018
Yeah, she can't have babies, either.

654
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,107
That's a shame.

655
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,775
When she was a baby, her mom
died in the middle of things, so...

656
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,114
When she was being born.

657
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:03,662
Like yours.

658
00:59:05,542 --> 00:59:07,124
You have a lot in common.

659
00:59:16,553 --> 00:59:21,765
Lars, you know
we've learned a lot since then.

660
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,469
Things are better.

661
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,635
Yeah, but it could still happen, right?

662
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,145
It's highly unlikely. It's...

663
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,728
It's... rare.

664
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:32,767
Yeah, but it still could.

665
00:59:36,907 --> 00:59:39,775
Lars, just take a breath.

666
00:59:45,957 --> 00:59:46,947
It's OK.

667
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:50,326
I'm sorry.

668
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,417
I'm sorry, it's just so dangerous.

669
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,628
It's so dangerous.
I don't like to think about it.

670
00:59:56,802 --> 00:59:58,794
Lars, sit down.
Put your head between your knees.

671
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,838
Put your head between your knees.
Sit down.

672
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:06,926
Just put your head between your knees.
Bend over. Bend over.

673
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:09,016
OK. OK.

674
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,679
OK.

675
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,192
- I'm sorry.
- It's OK.

676
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,853
Take a breath.

677
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:32,827
Look, they have cell phones.
We should get cell phones. Huh?

678
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:36,168
Then we can call each other
whenever we want.

679
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:39,630
When you're doing all your things
and I'm working.

680
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,224
How about afternoons,
Monday and Wednesdays,

681
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,061
and then maybe all day Saturday?

682
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:04,950
Yeah? Yeah? You sure? OK!

683
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:07,828
Bianca, is that OK with you?

684
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:11,833
Bianca wants to volunteer at the
hospital on Thursday afternoons.

685
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:14,706
You do?

686
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:18,297
What about your blood pressure?

687
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:22,881
Just think of all the bald children.
Wouldn't they just love her?

688
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,095
That's true.

689
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:28,429
Just a little bit of layering here
and some texture, kind of right there.

690
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,640
And I don't know
what you guys think but...

691
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:35,439
- Bangs?
- I like that.

692
01:01:35,609 --> 01:01:38,272
- That looks great.
- Oh, that's pretty. Real pretty.

693
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,609
Are you sure?
'Cause it's not growing back, right?

694
01:01:45,285 --> 01:01:49,029
<i>What's that Sound? By Veronika Charles.</i>

695
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,289
<i>I hear the telephone.</i>

696
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:52,539
Ring, ring!

697
01:02:28,370 --> 01:02:30,783
- Hey.
- Hey.

698
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,376
He's not gonna get any better, is he?

699
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:46,043
No. Probably not.

700
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,177
He's gonna love that thing...

701
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:57,104
...his whole life and it's all my fault.

702
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,021
No, it's not. It's...

703
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,528
Yeah, I don't know.

704
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:10,697
I mean, I left home as fast as I could.

705
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,156
You know?

706
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:16,369
I never thought about him.

707
01:03:16,543 --> 01:03:20,833
And then the two of us
move back here all fat and happy,

708
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:24,590
and he moves into the goddamn garage
like the family dog.

709
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,879
You know?

710
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,048
And I let him.

711
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,389
No wonder he goes
and orders a fiancée in a box.

712
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,601
Come here.

713
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,250
Hello.

714
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:51,464
Bianca!

715
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:53,633
We're upstairs.

716
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,970
What's going on?

717
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,185
It's the hospital volunteer banquet
at the VFW.

718
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:08,103
- Doesn't she look beautiful?
- Oh, she does. She looks beautiful.

719
01:05:10,532 --> 01:05:12,489
That's... 'cause...

720
01:05:14,411 --> 01:05:17,119
<i>We were supposed to play Scrabble.</i>

721
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,031
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

722
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:23,326
Her schedule's on the refrigerator.
Did you check?

723
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,829
No, I didn't. I guess I forgot.

724
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:34,220
Could I have a moment
alone with her, please?

725
01:05:38,852 --> 01:05:40,218
Thank you.

726
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,728
Thank you.

727
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:01,701
They never fight.

728
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,076
I don't like his tone.

729
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:15,716
Now you listen to me.
Bianca has a life of her own.

730
01:06:15,889 --> 01:06:18,552
No self-respecting woman's
gonna be at your beck and call, mister,

731
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,216
and the sooner you learn that,
the better.

732
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:21,634
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

733
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:24,394
You're away at your job all day.
What's she supposed to do?

734
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:28,854
Wait for you? Would you do that for her?
Would she even ask you to?

735
01:06:29,736 --> 01:06:31,944
She's out in the community,

736
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:35,356
doing things for others less fortunate.
You should be proud of her.

737
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:36,990
And what about me?

738
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:41,244
Big baby. He's just like my husband.

739
01:06:41,956 --> 01:06:43,743
She'll be home at 11:00.

740
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,262
She's my girlfriend

741
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,143
and I shouldn't have to check
a schedule to see her!

742
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,266
Are you OK?

743
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:15,192
How would she feel if I just left her?

744
01:07:16,115 --> 01:07:19,233
If I just abandoned her like that.

745
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:22,027
Whoa, wait, she didn't abandon you,
she'll be back.

746
01:07:23,623 --> 01:07:26,081
How do I know that, huh?

747
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,290
People do whatever they want.

748
01:07:31,673 --> 01:07:34,381
- They don't care.
- No, we all care.

749
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,292
Lars, we do care.

750
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:39,629
No, you don't.

751
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,972
That is...

752
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:44,258
That is just not true!

753
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:45,975
God!

754
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:51,061
Every person in this town
bends over backwards

755
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:52,941
to make Bianca feel at home.

756
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:56,479
Why do you think
she has so many places to go

757
01:07:56,656 --> 01:07:59,069
and so much to do, huh?

758
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,487
- Huh?
- I don't know.

759
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:03,448
Because of you!

760
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:07,205
Because all these people love you!

761
01:08:07,959 --> 01:08:10,952
We push her wheelchair.
We drive her to work.

762
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,337
We drive her home.

763
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,374
We wash her. We dress her.

764
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:20,420
We get her up, we put her to bed.
We carry her.

765
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:25,766
And she is not petite, Lars.
Bianca is a big, big girl.

766
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:31,973
None of this is easy for any of us,
but we do it.

767
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,777
We do it for you!

768
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,568
So don't you dare tell me
how we don't care.

769
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:01,381
I think it's the person's job
who's upset to say that they're upset

770
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,045
because we can't, you know...

771
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,054
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

772
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:07,682
- Hey.
- How was the game?

773
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:13,105
No, the cheese inspectors
beat the crap out of us.

774
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:16,851
Is everything all right?
I mean, I usually put Bianca to bed.

775
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,360
Yeah, I know.

776
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:22,356
OK, I'm telling him.

777
01:09:22,909 --> 01:09:25,401
Well, we wanted
to talk to you about that.

778
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:32,909
You don't have to do that anymore.
I'm gonna do that.

779
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:36,250
You sure? Because I don't mind.
And I thought that you...

780
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,831
I'm so sorry.

781
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:41,166
It's just been one of those days.

782
01:09:41,344 --> 01:09:46,556
It's fine, yeah, I mean,
it's up to you and...

783
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:51,678
Good. I'll leave you guys.

784
01:09:51,854 --> 01:09:53,846
Hey, Gus?

785
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,390
- What's that?
- Thank you, though.

786
01:09:57,485 --> 01:10:00,353
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, you did.

787
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:09,987
I'm tired.

788
01:10:17,171 --> 01:10:20,005
- Did I miss something?
- Shh! We had a big fight.

789
01:10:20,174 --> 01:10:21,665
- Really?
- Yes.

790
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,606
I think it's kind of cold out.

791
01:10:43,865 --> 01:10:45,731
Lars, have you met Erik?

792
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:49,151
Not officially.
You're pretty famous around here.

793
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,571
I know.

794
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,331
Hell of a grip, too, pal.

795
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:58,160
Yeah.

796
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,613
Yes?

797
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,371
My office.

798
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,628
(whispering0 I think I'm gonna stay.

799
01:11:46,886 --> 01:11:48,878
She's feeling pretty lousy today.

800
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:52,589
We'll both stay.

801
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:04,560
I asked her to marry me last week.

802
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:10,816
Congratulations.

803
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,202
When's the happy day?

804
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:18,115
- She said no.
- Oh.

805
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,371
Oh, no.

806
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,079
Yeah, I know, I couldn't believe it.

807
01:12:34,267 --> 01:12:38,181
Stop it! You have no right
to talk to me like that.

808
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:42,143
No, you don't. No, you don't.
I don't talk to you like that.

809
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,614
Could you stop yelling?

810
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,833
I was talking to Bianca,
and she was saying that in her culture,

811
01:13:43,002 --> 01:13:47,042
they have these rites of passages
and rituals and ceremonies.

812
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:50,461
Just all kinds of things, you know,
that when you do them,

813
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:52,126
at least when you're done,
if you live through them,

814
01:13:52,303 --> 01:13:54,340
that you know that you're an adult.

815
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,840
Doesn't that sound great?

816
01:13:58,684 --> 01:13:59,970
It does.

817
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,852
How did you know?

818
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,856
- How did I know what?
- That you were a man.

819
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,560
No, I couldn't tell you.

820
01:14:13,491 --> 01:14:14,982
Was it...

821
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,991
OK. Was it sex?

822
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:28,913
Yeah, you know, yeah.
I mean, it's... Yeah, it's kind of...

823
01:14:29,090 --> 01:14:34,176
No. Well, it's kind of sex but it's
not... It's not, you know...

824
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,382
I don't know. I don't know.

825
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:38,717
It's a good question.

826
01:14:39,558 --> 01:14:41,470
Yeah, but I have to know.

827
01:14:42,895 --> 01:14:44,557
Hold that thought.

828
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,740
You know, you should ask Dagmar.

829
01:14:57,910 --> 01:15:00,778
I did ask Dagmar
and she said that I should ask you.

830
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:06,916
OK, you know,
I can only give you my opinion.

831
01:15:07,086 --> 01:15:08,076
That's all I want.

832
01:15:08,254 --> 01:15:10,667
Well, it's not like you're all
one thing or the other, OK?

833
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,801
There's still a kid inside, but you grow
up when you decide to do right, OK?

834
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,087
And not what's right for you,
what's right for everybody,

835
01:15:18,264 --> 01:15:20,256
even when it hurts.

836
01:15:22,268 --> 01:15:24,100
OK. Like what?

837
01:15:27,106 --> 01:15:28,313
Like...

838
01:15:29,608 --> 01:15:32,442
You know, like,
you don't jerk people around, you know.

839
01:15:32,611 --> 01:15:34,773
And you don't cheat on your woman.

840
01:15:34,947 --> 01:15:37,189
And you take care of your family,
you know.

841
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,700
You admit when you're wrong,
or you try to, anyways.

842
01:15:42,496 --> 01:15:44,863
That's all I can think of, you know?

843
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,624
It sounds like it's easy
and for some reason it's not.

844
01:15:47,793 --> 01:15:49,785
I know, because nothing's easy.

845
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,123
It's like the old man.

846
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:53,209
He didn't have to take care
of two kids alone.

847
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,123
He could have given us
to an orphanage or something.

848
01:15:55,301 --> 01:15:56,712
You know, people do that.

849
01:15:56,886 --> 01:16:00,800
But he loved us and he tried to do right
even though he didn't know how,

850
01:16:00,973 --> 01:16:03,340
and even though he had a broken heart.

851
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:17,150
I shouldn't have left you alone
with him. He was too sad.

852
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,315
It scared me and I just...

853
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:21,942
I just ran.

854
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:27,618
And that was selfish.

855
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:31,034
And I'm sorry.

856
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,669
That's OK.

857
01:16:41,639 --> 01:16:42,755
OK.

858
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:49,511
You've crossed the line.

859
01:16:49,855 --> 01:16:51,938
Well, you kept
swiping my action figures.

860
01:16:52,108 --> 01:16:55,442
- I hide them. I don't hang them.
- Well, whatever, Margo.

861
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:58,354
You're too old
for that thing anyway, OK?

862
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:00,363
- Take off the noose.
- No.

863
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:01,649
Take it off.

864
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:05,445
Face it, Margo, the bear is dead. OK?
Burn on you.

865
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,377
I warned her.

866
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,431
It's not just the bear.

867
01:17:35,818 --> 01:17:37,650
I broke up with Erik.

868
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,323
I'm sorry to hear that.

869
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,786
Yeah, you know,
I didn't even have a good reason.

870
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:54,326
He just wasn't very interesting.

871
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,347
Then why was he your boyfriend?

872
01:18:10,603 --> 01:18:12,094
I get lonely.

873
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,106
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

874
01:18:35,753 --> 01:18:37,085
Thank you.

875
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,124
Sure.

876
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,089
Hey, what are you doing on Friday night?

877
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:50,928
I have this school board meeting.

878
01:18:52,519 --> 01:18:54,476
Bianca got elected so...

879
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,438
- That's great.
- Yeah.

880
01:18:57,608 --> 01:18:58,724
Yeah.

881
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:03,148
OK.

882
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:06,982
Why?

883
01:19:08,202 --> 01:19:12,162
I was just thinking that maybe
we could all go out sometime.

884
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,124
Never mind.

885
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:18,785
After I drop off Bianca, I'm free.

886
01:19:18,963 --> 01:19:21,671
But, you know, just me so...

887
01:19:26,345 --> 01:19:28,337
That would be great, Lars.

888
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:30,881
Thank you.

889
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,601
OK.

890
01:19:58,377 --> 01:19:59,743
Nice shot.

891
01:20:25,070 --> 01:20:27,232
You're putting too much
spin on the ball.

892
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:28,897
I know.

893
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,365
Yeah, still.

894
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:38,031
Sorry, we're full up. Next week
is the ladies' league tournament.

895
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,415
- Nada?
- Dude!

896
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,826
Tell them lady go.

897
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:43,416
No way, Nelson. They'll shred me.

898
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,672
Hey, is that Lars?

899
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:49,842
Hey, buddy.

900
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:52,755
<i>- We're full.
- No problema.</i>

901
01:20:55,684 --> 01:20:57,266
Yes!

902
01:20:57,436 --> 01:21:00,895
- Margo, I kicked your butt!
- No, Nelson, I'll kick your butt.

903
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:07,610
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

904
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:08,987
Margo!

905
01:21:09,156 --> 01:21:10,146
Oh.

906
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:13,824
- Oh!
- Yeah!

907
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,995
Baby, where you been all my life?

908
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:27,603
This is exactly what I needed.

909
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:30,359
Things look so much better.

910
01:22:31,697 --> 01:22:34,690
Anyway, thanks for going bowling
with me, Lars.

911
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,707
I don't...

912
01:22:52,759 --> 01:22:54,125
I don't...

913
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:59,757
I don't wanna give you
the wrong idea about this.

914
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:03,976
I just...

915
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:08,060
I'm never gonna cheat on Bianca, ever.

916
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,395
Oh. No.

917
01:23:11,278 --> 01:23:17,024
Oh, my God, I hope you didn't think
that. Lars, I would never do that.

918
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:29,327
I would never do that.

919
01:23:33,634 --> 01:23:36,923
OK, good. Yeah, yeah, I...

920
01:23:37,095 --> 01:23:40,930
It's just 'cause a man
doesn't cheat on his woman, that's that.

921
01:23:41,099 --> 01:23:44,137
Absolutely. And vice versa.

922
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:48,810
Besides, I don't need
to steal anybody's boyfriend.

923
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,774
One day I'll find a man of my own and...

924
01:23:54,071 --> 01:23:55,528
...we'll be happy, too.

925
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:01,238
Yeah, that's the way it works, I guess.

926
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:25,679
Snow.

927
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:34,142
I was hoping that winter was over.

928
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,437
No, it's just a thaw.

929
01:24:37,614 --> 01:24:39,856
Winter isn't over till Easter.

930
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,782
Thanks again.

931
01:24:50,002 --> 01:24:51,368
Hey.

932
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:19,688
Good night, Lars.

933
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:42,135
I'm not sure how well
these treatments are working.

934
01:25:42,304 --> 01:25:43,545
No?

935
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,933
What do you think?

936
01:25:51,605 --> 01:25:53,062
I don't know.

937
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:01,730
I'm sorry.

938
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,951
I don't know. It's hard.
It's hard because...

939
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,914
I know that she loves me,

940
01:26:19,091 --> 01:26:22,129
but I ask her to marry me
and she says no.

941
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:27,506
Or she says, "I don't know."

942
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:32,177
Or she doesn't say anything.

943
01:26:37,442 --> 01:26:38,603
Nothing?

944
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:51,204
"When I was a child, I spake as a child,

945
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,786
I understood as a child."

946
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:11,348
Hey.

947
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,020
Doesn't it feel good?

948
01:27:57,481 --> 01:28:01,350
Wake up! Wake up!

949
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,778
She won't wake up.

950
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:08,860
Bianca! I think she's unconscious. Hey.

951
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:11,492
- Are you sure?
- Look at me. Bianca.

952
01:28:11,661 --> 01:28:14,449
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey!

953
01:28:14,623 --> 01:28:16,535
- Bianca's unconscious.
- Can you hear me?

954
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,040
Bianca.

955
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,287
Come on, wake up.

956
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,581
Hey, hey, hey, she looks all
right. She looks all right.

957
01:28:24,758 --> 01:28:26,715
She looks all right. Hey, hey, hey, hey!

958
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:29,172
- Call 911!
- OK. OK.

959
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:30,712
All right.

960
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:33,173
911.

961
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:37,101
Well, I don't know. Why do you always
expect me to know what to do?

962
01:28:46,530 --> 01:28:48,897
They're here. Call Dr. Berman.

963
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,751
I'm sorry, you'll have to wait out here.

964
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:05,584
Don't worry about it. It's all right.

965
01:29:05,757 --> 01:29:08,374
- I just wanna see...
- It's OK. Doctor's on the way.

966
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:11,260
OK. Hello? Hello?

967
01:29:11,429 --> 01:29:13,341
- Lars. Lars.
- Yeah.

968
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:25,725
What?

969
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:30,230
What?

970
01:29:31,449 --> 01:29:33,441
Bianca's very sick.

971
01:29:35,370 --> 01:29:38,704
No, she's not. She's not.
Come on, she's not sick.

972
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,285
She's not, Lars.

973
01:29:43,587 --> 01:29:44,748
She's dying.

974
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:48,460
- But...
- God.

975
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,670
We're gonna keep her here
till she's stable,

976
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:54,508
but she wants
to go home with Lars tonight.

977
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:56,513
- Can I see her?
- Sure.

978
01:30:21,166 --> 01:30:22,282
What?

979
01:30:42,854 --> 01:30:46,268
I'm sorry but I just don't get it.
I don't.

980
01:30:46,441 --> 01:30:49,104
I mean, what's this gonna do to him?

981
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:50,939
How could you let this happen?

982
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:54,822
I'm not letting it happen, it's Lars.
It's always been Lars.

983
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:58,283
He's making the decisions.

984
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:00,536
He's the one who found her unconscious.

985
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,947
He's the one who said she's dying.

986
01:31:16,179 --> 01:31:17,920
You OK back there?

987
01:31:18,682 --> 01:31:21,550
They gave her something so she's asleep.

988
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,095
Anything you want, Lars?

989
01:31:30,610 --> 01:31:33,728
We wanna stay together
in the pink room tonight.

990
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:24,889
Come down to the family room, Lars.
Let Bianca rest.

991
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:36,521
We sent Gus and Karin to the movies.

992
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,979
They didn't want to leave you two.

993
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:49,489
No, I'm glad that they...
I'm glad they left.

994
01:33:49,666 --> 01:33:53,159
I feel terrible that all this is
happening so close with the baby coming.

995
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:57,129
That's how life is, Lars.
Everything at once.

996
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,039
We brought casseroles.

997
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:01,959
Thank you.

998
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,728
Is there something
that I should be doing right now?

999
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,480
No, dear. You eat.

1000
01:34:16,943 --> 01:34:18,730
We came over to sit.

1001
01:34:18,903 --> 01:34:21,646
That's what people do
when tragedy strikes.

1002
01:34:21,823 --> 01:34:23,564
They come over and sit.

1003
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:25,775
OK.

1004
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,538
Don't you feel a little better?

1005
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:53,765
I got spring fever.
We're going to the lake.

1006
01:34:53,938 --> 01:34:55,270
You wanna come?

1007
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:06,691
Hey, Lars, why don't you come with us?

1008
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:08,609
It would do everybody good.

1009
01:35:15,543 --> 01:35:16,750
Bianca?

1010
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:20,580
Don't you wanna see this beautiful day?

1011
01:35:34,312 --> 01:35:38,022
- Is there a storm coming?
- The weather said no.

1012
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,853
It looks like a storm to me.

1013
01:35:44,989 --> 01:35:48,858
Well, I need to stretch my legs.
Let's take a chance.

1014
01:35:55,458 --> 01:35:56,448
Lars?

1015
01:36:00,171 --> 01:36:02,709
I think we're gonna watch the water.

1016
01:36:03,174 --> 01:36:05,040
Well, we won't be far.

1017
01:36:06,177 --> 01:36:08,794
- Holler if you need us.
- OK.

1018
01:37:56,621 --> 01:37:58,283
All right. So you think
it's not the right color?

1019
01:37:58,456 --> 01:38:00,618
Well, I don't know.
Does it match the curtains?

1020
01:38:00,792 --> 01:38:04,456
What? I think so.
Here, hey, just be careful.

1021
01:38:04,629 --> 01:38:05,790
OK.

1022
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:14,302
Gus.

1023
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:19,349
No, no, don't run.

1024
01:38:19,519 --> 01:38:20,635
Lars!

1025
01:38:22,438 --> 01:38:23,554
Lars!

1026
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:52,420
Lars asked us not to wear black today.

1027
01:38:53,886 --> 01:38:59,257
He did so to remind us
that this is no ordinary funeral.

1028
01:39:02,520 --> 01:39:06,764
We are here to celebrate
Bianca's extraordinary life.

1029
01:39:09,193 --> 01:39:14,939
From her wheelchair,
Bianca reached out and touched us all

1030
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:18,700
in ways we could have never imagined.

1031
01:39:20,580 --> 01:39:22,287
She was a teacher.

1032
01:39:25,084 --> 01:39:28,202
She was a lesson in courage.

1033
01:39:33,259 --> 01:39:35,251
And Bianca loved us all...

1034
01:39:37,221 --> 01:39:38,837
...especially Lars.

1035
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,595
Especially him.

1036
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:30,726
Hi.

1037
01:40:31,567 --> 01:40:34,059
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I just...

1038
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:38,488
Yeah, I don't know. It's just funerals,

1039
01:40:38,658 --> 01:40:41,025
and Mom and Dad, and, you know...

1040
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:51,789
- He's unbelievable, huh?
- Yes.

1041
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:01,011
I wanted to thank you for...

1042
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:11,896
Gus?

1043
01:41:18,990 --> 01:41:21,983
- So, shall we see you at the house?
- Of course.

1044
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,866
- OK.
- Sure.

1045
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:56,562
She asked me not to be sad,
but I can't help it.

1046
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:01,859
Yeah, me, neither.

1047
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:07,861
But it will get better with time.

1048
01:42:10,082 --> 01:42:12,870
That's what everyone keeps saying, so...

1049
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:17,542
It's true, I think, in a way.

1050
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,965
But there'll never be anybody like her.

1051
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:50,070
Well, I suppose we should...

1052
01:42:51,749 --> 01:42:53,706
...catch up with everyone.

1053
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,170
Do you wanna take a walk?

1054
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:07,261
Yes.
