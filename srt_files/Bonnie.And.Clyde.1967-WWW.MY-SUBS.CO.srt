1
00:03:29,562 --> 00:03:30,722
Hey, boy!

2
00:03:31,564 --> 00:03:33,532
What are you doing with my mama's car?

3
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:42,231
Wait there!

4
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,549
Ain't you ashamed?

5
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:04,259
Trying to steal an
old lady's automobile?

6
00:04:04,563 --> 00:04:05,996
Oh, come on, now,
what are you talking about?

7
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,258
I've been thinking about buying me one.

8
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:08,756
Bull!

9
00:04:09,268 --> 00:04:12,066
You ain't got money for dinner,
let alone buying a car.

10
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:15,069
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you something.

11
00:04:17,576 --> 00:04:19,567
I've got enough money
for a Coca-Cola...

12
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,403
...and since it don't look like
you're going to invite me inside...

13
00:04:22,782 --> 00:04:25,273
You'd steal the dining
room table if I did.

14
00:04:26,585 --> 00:04:28,917
You want to go into town with me?
How would that be?

15
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:32,587
I'm going to work, anyway.

16
00:04:33,592 --> 00:04:36,789
You're going to work?
What kind of work do you do?

17
00:04:37,096 --> 00:04:38,290
None of your business.

18
00:04:39,098 --> 00:04:40,793
I'll bet you're a movie star.

19
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,431
A lady mechanic.

20
00:04:44,603 --> 00:04:45,592
A maid?

21
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:47,599
What do you think I am?

22
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,100
A waitress.

23
00:04:56,448 --> 00:05:00,111
What line of work are you in?
When you're not stealing cars?

24
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,453
I tell you, I'm looking for suitable
employment right at the moment.

25
00:05:04,824 --> 00:05:06,451
Oh, yes, but what did you do before?

26
00:05:06,826 --> 00:05:09,818
I was in State Prison.

27
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:11,318
State Prison?

28
00:05:15,634 --> 00:05:18,967
Well, I guess, some little
old lady wasn't so nice.

29
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:22,967
It was armed robbery.

30
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:32,845
The things that turn up in
the street these days.

31
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:43,651
What do you all do for a good time
around here? Listen to the grass grow?

32
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:47,363
I guess you had a lot more
fun up at State Prison.

33
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:51,359
I tell you. You see my right foot?

34
00:05:52,671 --> 00:05:55,663
I chopped two toes off
that foot with an axe.

35
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:57,168
What! Why?

36
00:05:57,509 --> 00:05:59,500
To get off of work detail.
You want to see it?

37
00:06:03,883 --> 00:06:07,683
I surely don't intend to stand
here in the middle of Main Street...

38
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,181
...and look at your dirty feet!

39
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,521
Boy, did you really do that?

40
00:06:36,415 --> 00:06:37,905
What's it like?

41
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,413
What do you mean, prison?

42
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:46,213
Armed robbery.

43
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:55,230
It ain't like anything.

44
00:06:56,735 --> 00:07:00,432
Shoot. I knew you never
robbed any place, you faker.

45
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:29,457
Bet you wouldn't have
the gumption to use it.

46
00:07:38,277 --> 00:07:41,110
You just wait right here and
you keep your eyes open.

47
00:08:14,813 --> 00:08:16,144
What's your name?

48
00:08:17,149 --> 00:08:18,013
Clyde Barrow.

49
00:08:19,018 --> 00:08:21,009
Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.
Pleased to meet you.

50
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:52,044
Hey, hey, slow down,
slow down.

51
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:55,213
Take it easy, you've
got my hand trapped.

52
00:08:55,554 --> 00:08:56,885
Cut it out! Cut it out!

53
00:09:07,566 --> 00:09:08,897
All right, now.

54
00:09:09,201 --> 00:09:12,693
I might as well tell you right off.
I ain't much of a lover boy.

55
00:09:13,572 --> 00:09:15,062
That don't mean nothing
personal about you.

56
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:18,573
I never saw no percentage in it.

57
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:21,205
Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I don't like boys.

58
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:28,242
Boy! Boy! Boy!

59
00:09:30,255 --> 00:09:31,244
"Boy," what?

60
00:09:31,723 --> 00:09:33,918
Your advertising is just dandy.

61
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,220
Folks would never guess
you don't have a thing to sell.

62
00:09:39,798 --> 00:09:41,129
You'd better take me home now.

63
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,457
- Now, wait a minute.
- Now don't you touch me.

64
00:09:46,638 --> 00:09:47,969
All right, all right...

65
00:09:48,807 --> 00:09:50,934
...if all you want is a stud service,
you get on back to West Dallas,

66
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,477
...and you stay there,
the rest of your life.

67
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:56,573
You're worth more than that,
a lot more than that,

68
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:58,310
...and you know it, and that's why
you're comin' along with me.

69
00:10:01,153 --> 00:10:03,314
You could find a lover boy on
every damn corner in town.

70
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,589
It don't make a damn to them if you're
waiting on tables or picking cotton,

71
00:10:05,624 --> 00:10:07,148
...but it does make a damn to me.

72
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:11,284
Why?

73
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,155
Why, what do you mean why?
Because you're different, that's why.

74
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,130
You know, you're like me.
You want different things.

75
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,660
You've got something
better than being a waitress.

76
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:23,304
You and me traveling together, we could
cut a path clean across this state...

77
00:10:23,342 --> 00:10:27,802
...and Kansas and Missouri and Oklahoma,
and everybody would know about it.

78
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,514
You listen to me, Miss Bonnie Parker.
You listen to me.

79
00:10:30,849 --> 00:10:32,612
Now, how would you like to go
walking into the dining room...

80
00:10:32,651 --> 00:10:34,175
...of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas...

81
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,988
...wearing a nice silk dress and
have everybody waiting on you?

82
00:10:37,756 --> 00:10:39,849
Would you like that?
That seem like a lot to ask?

83
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,853
That ain't enough for you.
You've got a right to that.

84
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,198
When did you figure all that up?

85
00:10:51,203 --> 00:10:52,363
The minute I saw you.

86
00:10:56,341 --> 00:10:58,332
Because you may be the
best damn girl in Texas.

87
00:11:11,056 --> 00:11:13,047
You were born somewhere
around east Texas, right?

88
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,221
Come from a big old family.

89
00:11:20,065 --> 00:11:21,362
You went to school, of course,
but you didn't take to it much...

90
00:11:21,433 --> 00:11:23,230
...because you were a lot
smarter than everybody else...

91
00:11:23,735 --> 00:11:25,225
...so you just up and quit one day.

92
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:29,905
Now, when you were 16... 17,
there was a guy who worked in a...

93
00:11:30,742 --> 00:11:31,731
Cement plant.

94
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,066
Right, cement plant.
And you liked him,

95
00:11:33,145 --> 00:11:35,909
...because he thought you were
just as nice as you could be.

96
00:11:36,248 --> 00:11:39,081
You almost married that guy, but then you
thought no, you didn't think you would.

97
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,318
So then you got your job in a cafe.

98
00:11:41,386 --> 00:11:43,217
And now you wake up every
morning and you hate it.

99
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:49,087
You just hate it. You get on down there
and you put on your white uniform...

100
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,251
It's pink.

101
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:54,327
And those truck drivers come in there
to eat your greasy burgers and...

102
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,926
...they kid you and you kid them back
but they're stupid and dumb boys...

103
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,760
...with their big old tattoos
on them, and you don't like it.

104
00:12:00,772 --> 00:12:03,104
They ask you for dates and sometimes
you go, but you mostly don't because...

105
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:06,434
...all they're trying to do is get in your
pants, whether you want them to or not.

106
00:12:06,945 --> 00:12:08,776
So you go on home and you
sit in your room and...

107
00:12:09,114 --> 00:12:11,605
...you think, now when, and how...

108
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:14,783
...am I ever going to
get away from this?

109
00:12:17,956 --> 00:12:19,287
And now you know.

110
00:12:31,136 --> 00:12:33,127
Change that. I don't like it.

111
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,490
You're a knock-out!

112
00:13:09,675 --> 00:13:11,165
That ain't ours.

113
00:13:12,344 --> 00:13:13,675
No, but we came in this one.

114
00:13:14,012 --> 00:13:15,673
That don't mean we
have to go home in it.

115
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:56,877
Where have you been keeping yourself?

116
00:13:57,222 --> 00:13:58,712
I slept out by the car.

117
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:02,720
These accommodations ain't
particularly deluxe.

118
00:14:03,061 --> 00:14:05,052
If they're after us,
I want the first shot.

119
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,064
Now, you come on out here.
We got some work to do.

120
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,404
Sheww! You're good.

121
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,077
I ain't good. I'm the best.

122
00:14:22,414 --> 00:14:23,574
And modest.

123
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,582
Now, see that there now?
Set her spinning.

124
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,417
It's all right, all right.
Come on, now, try it again.

125
00:14:36,762 --> 00:14:39,424
And try and get, now this
time come down slow.

126
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:50,101
How about that? Now, ain't
you something? I tell you.

127
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:53,275
Look, I'm going to get you a Smith &
Wesson. Go in your hand easier. Ok?

128
00:14:53,612 --> 00:14:55,102
Now, I want you to try something now.

129
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,747
No, sir! No, sir!

130
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:02,942
You all go right ahead.

131
00:15:14,966 --> 00:15:18,959
Used to be my place.
But it's not anymore.

132
00:15:21,473 --> 00:15:22,963
Bank took it.

133
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,645
Yes, sir, they moved us off.

134
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:33,144
Now it belongs to them.

135
00:15:36,955 --> 00:15:38,650
Why, that's a pitiful shame.

136
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,321
You're damn right, ma'am.

137
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:48,330
Me and him put in the years here.

138
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:55,667
You all go right ahead.
We just come by for a last look.

139
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:18,651
You all mind?

140
00:16:18,997 --> 00:16:20,988
Hey, Davis!
Come on over here!

141
00:16:35,347 --> 00:16:36,336
That's right.

142
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,342
Go on.

143
00:16:56,067 --> 00:16:57,056
Much obliged.

144
00:16:57,402 --> 00:17:00,860
My name is Otis Harris. This is Davis.
We worked this place.

145
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,030
How're you?
This here's Miss Bonnie Parker.

146
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,036
- Glad to meet you.
- I'm Clyde Barrow.

147
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:12,747
We rob banks.

148
00:17:23,428 --> 00:17:25,419
Look, I don't want you
to worry about nothing.

149
00:17:26,431 --> 00:17:28,729
This is going to be
the easiest thing in the world.

150
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:29,756
Your mama could take this bank.

151
00:17:41,613 --> 00:17:43,274
You just be ready if I need you.

152
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:09,637
What are you waiting for?

153
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:22,977
This is a stick-up! Just take it easy
and nothing's going to happen to you.

154
00:18:23,822 --> 00:18:24,982
Give me the money.

155
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:27,651
Give me the money.

156
00:18:27,993 --> 00:18:30,655
What money, mister?
There ain't no money here.

157
00:18:33,164 --> 00:18:34,654
What are you talking about?
This here's a bank, ain't it?

158
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:39,497
Well, it was a bank, but
we failed three weeks ago.

159
00:18:47,178 --> 00:18:49,009
All right, now, you get on out there.

160
00:18:59,024 --> 00:19:00,514
You get on out there and tell my girl.

161
00:19:03,695 --> 00:19:05,686
Come on, you tell her
what you told me.

162
00:19:40,398 --> 00:19:42,730
We've got $1.98 and you're laughing!

163
00:19:53,311 --> 00:19:56,803
Let's see now. A loaf of
bread, a dozen eggs...

164
00:19:57,148 --> 00:20:00,140
...quart of milk, four fried pies.

165
00:20:07,158 --> 00:20:09,319
Come on now, you sure you
ain't got no peach pies?

166
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,245
Get the hell out of here!

167
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:40,580
Go ahead! Go ahead!

168
00:20:45,029 --> 00:20:49,022
He tried to kill me. Why'd he try to
kill me? I didn't want to hurt him.

169
00:20:50,602 --> 00:20:51,591
Try to get something to eat around here,

170
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,194
...and some son-of-a-bitch
comes up on you with a meat-cleaver.

171
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,872
I ain't against him.

172
00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:06,209
I ain't against him.

173
00:21:38,082 --> 00:21:39,071
Now, you just tell me what
was wrong with that.

174
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,247
Dirt.

175
00:21:42,086 --> 00:21:44,247
Dirt in the fuel line.
Just blowed it away.

176
00:21:46,925 --> 00:21:48,916
Excuse me, ma'am, is there
anything else I could do for you?

177
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,261
Well, you're a smart feller.

178
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:57,095
You sure do know a lot about
automobiles, don't you?

179
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:00,934
Yes. I guess I do.

180
00:22:05,109 --> 00:22:07,100
Would you know what kind of car this is?

181
00:22:08,947 --> 00:22:11,279
This is a 4 cylinder Ford coupe.

182
00:22:14,619 --> 00:22:16,450
Sure, sure is.

183
00:22:17,622 --> 00:22:21,786
This is a stolen, four
cylinder Ford coupe.

184
00:22:25,797 --> 00:22:27,128
Hey, you ain't scared, are you?

185
00:22:34,806 --> 00:22:36,137
I believe he is.

186
00:22:37,308 --> 00:22:39,776
That's a pity now. We sure could
have used a smart boy like that...

187
00:22:39,878 --> 00:22:41,971
...who knows such a great
deal about automobiles.

188
00:22:45,984 --> 00:22:47,315
Hey, you a good driver?

189
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,310
Yeah, reckon I am.

190
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,481
No, he's better off here.

191
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,820
What's your name, boy?

192
00:22:57,662 --> 00:22:58,822
C.W. Moss.

193
00:22:58,897 --> 00:23:02,833
I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and
this here is Mr. Clyde Barrow.

194
00:23:03,668 --> 00:23:05,329
We rob banks.

195
00:23:18,082 --> 00:23:19,515
There ain't nothing wrong
with that, is it?

196
00:23:24,355 --> 00:23:26,016
Clyde, he ain't
the one. Let's go.

197
00:23:27,859 --> 00:23:29,520
You think you got the guts
for our line of work?

198
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:33,854
What are you talking about?
I spent a year in reformatory.

199
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:35,696
A man with a record.

200
00:23:36,034 --> 00:23:38,696
I know you got the nerve to short
change old ladies coming in for gas...

201
00:23:39,037 --> 00:23:42,029
...what I'm asking you is have you got
what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?

202
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:49,043
Sure, I do. I ain't afraid,
if that's what you think.

203
00:23:49,447 --> 00:23:50,709
Prove it.

204
00:24:20,311 --> 00:24:21,300
You're gonna be all right.

205
00:26:35,613 --> 00:26:37,604
I'm afraid we're overdrawn again.

206
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:40,206
This is a stick-up!

207
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,380
This here's a stick-up!

208
00:26:45,623 --> 00:26:46,612
Leave it there.
Leave it there.

209
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:04,738
Come on, everything.
Get it up here.

210
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:22,323
Clyde, where's the car?

211
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:36,437
What the hell you doing,
parking the car?

212
00:27:47,118 --> 00:27:48,449
Stop that car!

213
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:52,619
Up ahead, cut left!

214
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:09,637
"We're in the money, the sky is sunny.

215
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:13,304
"Old man depression, you are
through, you done us wrong.

216
00:28:14,312 --> 00:28:17,475
"We never see a headline,
about a bread line, today.

217
00:28:17,982 --> 00:28:21,816
"And when we see the landlord, we
can look that guy right in the eye.

218
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:24,977
"Oh, we're in the money,
Come on, my honey."

219
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,984
You ain't got a brain in your skull.

220
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:38,824
On account of you, I killed a man.

221
00:28:38,936 --> 00:28:42,167
And now we're all going to be wanted
for murder, and that's you too, boy.

222
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:55,515
Dumb head! Stupid!

223
00:28:56,854 --> 00:28:58,344
What were you thinking about?

224
00:29:01,025 --> 00:29:03,357
Do a dumb ass thing like that
again, I'm going to kill you.

225
00:29:05,029 --> 00:29:07,691
If you boys want to talk,
why don't you all go outside?

226
00:29:47,972 --> 00:29:51,965
Come on, I want to talk to you
for just a minute. Sit down.

227
00:29:57,315 --> 00:29:59,977
This afternoon we killed
a man and we were seen.

228
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,312
So far, nobody
knows who you are...

229
00:30:02,653 --> 00:30:03,984
...but they know who I am and
they're going to be running after me,

230
00:30:04,155 --> 00:30:05,486
...and anybody who's running with me.

231
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,821
And that's murder.
Now it's going to get rough.

232
00:30:08,993 --> 00:30:10,483
I can't get out, but
right now you still can.

233
00:30:10,828 --> 00:30:12,295
I want you to say the word to me,

234
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:14,491
...and I'm going to put you on that bus
back to your mama...

235
00:30:14,999 --> 00:30:17,490
...because you mean a lot to me, and
I ain't going to make you run with me.

236
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,340
Now, I ain't a rich man. You could
get a rich man if you tried.

237
00:30:30,681 --> 00:30:32,672
I don't want no rich man!

238
00:30:40,024 --> 00:30:41,685
You ain't going to
have a minute's peace.

239
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:43,515
You promise?

240
00:33:25,356 --> 00:33:26,846
Least I'm not a liar.

241
00:33:39,703 --> 00:33:41,694
I told you I wasn't no lover boy.

242
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:13,560
Let me look at you boy.

243
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:21,901
Oh, boy, you can do better than that.

244
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:28,411
Hey, how's mama?

245
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:31,410
Oh, fine, fine. Sister
sent her best to you.

246
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,416
Filling out there, boy.
Must be that prison food.

247
00:34:33,757 --> 00:34:36,089
No, no, it's married life...

248
00:34:36,427 --> 00:34:38,588
...you know what they say...

249
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,261
...it's the face powder that
gives a man interest...

250
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:43,760
...but it's the baking powder
that keeps him home.

251
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,601
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

252
00:34:49,106 --> 00:34:50,437
This is my baby brother.

253
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:52,439
How're you doing?
It's really nice to know you.

254
00:34:52,509 --> 00:34:53,601
How do you do?

255
00:35:06,123 --> 00:35:08,785
I hear you're taking real good care
of the baby of the family...

256
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:10,950
I'm just so glad to meet you.
Come on over here.

257
00:35:11,095 --> 00:35:12,289
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

258
00:35:17,134 --> 00:35:19,466
Everybody, this is C.W. Moss.

259
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:21,130
My brother, Buck, and his wife, Blanche.

260
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:25,131
Howdy, everybody.
Howdy, you all.

261
00:35:25,976 --> 00:35:29,639
Howdy, Mrs. Barrow, or may
I call you Blanche?

262
00:35:30,481 --> 00:35:31,971
I sure am pleased to meet you.

263
00:35:32,149 --> 00:35:34,140
How did you find us here
in this neck of the woods?

264
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:36,646
You sure picked a good day for it.

265
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:38,819
Is that a new Screenland Magazine?

266
00:35:40,491 --> 00:35:42,482
Are there any new pictures of
Myrna Loy in there?

267
00:35:42,559 --> 00:35:44,993
She's my favorite picture star.

268
00:35:45,996 --> 00:35:48,487
Let me get the Kodak here.
We'll take some pictures.

269
00:35:48,832 --> 00:35:50,163
Come on, put your pants on.
We're going to take some pictures.

270
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:51,323
Come on Blanche,
get out of there!

271
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:55,833
I'm a mess.
Been driving all day.

272
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:06,013
Did you take my picture? I declare.
I asked you not to take my picture.

273
00:36:06,684 --> 00:36:08,515
Hey, Buck, get one of this.

274
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,851
Brother, I want to talk
to you later on.

275
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:19,851
You got that?

276
00:36:21,865 --> 00:36:24,026
You take one of me and
my missus, here, Clyde.

277
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:29,703
I don't want a picture taken.

278
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:34,700
Be serious. Be serious.

279
00:36:38,382 --> 00:36:40,543
Let me take one of Bonnie alone.
Come on, honey.

280
00:36:52,563 --> 00:36:54,053
Hey, a little smile.

281
00:36:54,732 --> 00:36:55,721
Don't want to smile?

282
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:00,169
Come on, I want to have a chat with
you. C.W., take the girls' pictures.

283
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:03,401
Why don't you step
in there with Bonnie?

284
00:37:03,907 --> 00:37:05,238
What did you think of her?

285
00:37:08,245 --> 00:37:09,576
She's a peach.

286
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,251
Now, tell me true.

287
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:22,081
Is she as good as she looks?

288
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:26,418
She's better.

289
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:36,929
Listen, it was, either you
or him, wasn't it?

290
00:37:37,441 --> 00:37:39,932
The guy that you killed, you had
to do it, didn't you?

291
00:37:40,277 --> 00:37:41,608
He put me on the spot. I had to.

292
00:37:41,945 --> 00:37:42,934
You had to do it, right?

293
00:37:45,616 --> 00:37:48,608
I know you did. Don't say
anything to Blanche about that.

294
00:37:51,622 --> 00:37:54,955
That time you broke out of jail, that
true she talked you into going back?

295
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,953
You hear about that?

296
00:37:59,963 --> 00:38:02,625
Well, I won't say nothing
to Bonnie about it.

297
00:38:02,966 --> 00:38:04,297
I appreciate that.

298
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:17,473
We're going to have
ourselves a time, boy!

299
00:38:17,581 --> 00:38:18,570
We surely are.

300
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:26,649
What are we going to do?

301
00:38:30,994 --> 00:38:34,486
I figured we all drive up to Missouri.

302
00:38:34,832 --> 00:38:35,821
They ain't looking for me up there.

303
00:38:35,999 --> 00:38:38,991
We find a nice little place to hole up in.
We have us a regular vacation.

304
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:45,497
No trouble now.

305
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,841
I ain't looking to go back to no prison.

306
00:38:48,178 --> 00:38:50,009
I heard in prison that you had
a little trouble there.

307
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:51,671
You were cutting on your toes.

308
00:38:53,016 --> 00:38:54,847
You heard about that?

309
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:57,509
I did a little toe cutting.
That ain't but half of it.

310
00:38:57,855 --> 00:38:58,844
I did it so I could get off
of work detail.

311
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:01,516
Breaking those rocks with a
sledge hammer night and day.

312
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,692
And you know what?
The very next week I got paroled.

313
00:39:05,696 --> 00:39:08,187
I walk out of that God-
forsaken jail on crutches.

314
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,031
Ain't life grand?

315
00:39:20,878 --> 00:39:24,712
You want to hear a story, about
this boy, he owned a dairy farm...

316
00:39:25,215 --> 00:39:27,206
And his old ma, she was
kind of sick, you know.

317
00:39:27,551 --> 00:39:30,543
And the doctor, he called
him over and said...

318
00:39:30,888 --> 00:39:34,380
"...Listen, your ma, just lying there,
she's just so sick and she's weakly...

319
00:39:36,059 --> 00:39:39,222
"...I want you to try to persuade
her to take a little brandy."

320
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:41,394
"Just to pick her spirits up."

321
00:39:41,732 --> 00:39:46,226
"Ma's a teetotaler," he says,
"she wouldn't touch a drop."

322
00:39:46,904 --> 00:39:49,236
"Well, I'll tell you what you do."
That's the doc.

323
00:39:49,573 --> 00:39:50,733
"Now, I tell you what you do..."

324
00:39:51,408 --> 00:39:54,741
"...you bring in a fresh quart
of milk every day..."

325
00:39:55,078 --> 00:39:57,911
"...and you put some brandy in it, see.
And you try that."

326
00:39:58,248 --> 00:40:02,241
So he did, and he doctored it all up
with the brandy, fresh milk...

327
00:40:02,586 --> 00:40:06,249
...and gave it to his mama, and she drank
a little bit of it. She didn't, you know.

328
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:11,084
So next day he brought it in again,
and she drank a little more.

329
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:14,922
And so then, it went on that way,
the third day just a little more...

330
00:40:15,265 --> 00:40:18,098
...and the fourth day she was, you
know, took a little bit more...

331
00:40:18,435 --> 00:40:21,927
...and then finally, a week later,
he gave her the milk...

332
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:25,435
...and she just drank it down, she
swallowed the whole thing...

333
00:40:25,776 --> 00:40:27,107
...and she called him
over and she said...

334
00:40:27,444 --> 00:40:30,936
"...Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow."

335
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:46,626
All right, you got the
keys now, haven't you?

336
00:41:04,648 --> 00:41:08,140
I gave him a month's rent in advance.
We're all set. Let's get inside.

337
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:14,647
Honey, I'm taking
you to our first home.

338
00:41:15,325 --> 00:41:16,986
"Here comes the bride."

339
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:19,158
What do you think, honey?

340
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,820
Just perfect.

341
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,331
This is your first home.

342
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,165
He gave me the grocery number.

343
00:41:35,512 --> 00:41:37,002
4-3-3-7, please.

344
00:41:38,348 --> 00:41:41,681
Hi, there, Speedie's Groceries?
I want to order up a mess of groceries.

345
00:41:42,185 --> 00:41:44,676
And a Frigidaire, not an ice-box.

346
00:41:50,527 --> 00:41:53,519
Eight pounds of pork chops,
four pounds of red beans.

347
00:41:56,533 --> 00:41:59,024
About eight bottles of Dr. Pepper.

348
00:42:11,214 --> 00:42:13,205
You sure can play checkers.

349
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,551
You need a haircut. You're
looking just like a hillbilly boy.

350
00:42:25,896 --> 00:42:28,228
You are just like an old man.

351
00:42:28,565 --> 00:42:31,398
Playing checkers all the time, don't pay
any attention to your little old wife.

352
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:34,226
You ain't going to ever beat me,
but you just keep trying.

353
00:42:35,739 --> 00:42:39,903
Oh, Daddy, you sure do need a haircut.

354
00:42:40,243 --> 00:42:43,235
Why, you look like a little
old hillbilly, I do declare.

355
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,413
Oh, mercy me, don't.

356
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:49,583
Don't talk that way when she's
right there in the next room.

357
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,911
There is always somebody in
the next room, in this room,

358
00:42:52,089 --> 00:42:54,080
...or in every other kind of room.

359
00:42:57,094 --> 00:42:59,085
Don't you ever just want
to be alone with me?

360
00:42:59,596 --> 00:43:01,587
I always feel like we're alone.

361
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:04,597
Do you, baby?

362
00:43:04,935 --> 00:43:06,095
I'm hungry.

363
00:43:19,116 --> 00:43:20,105
Groceries, ma'am.

364
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,217
- How much?
- Six dollars and 43 cents.

365
00:43:43,306 --> 00:43:44,796
Here, ma'am, let me help you with...
those bags are heavy.

366
00:43:45,142 --> 00:43:46,473
No, thanks, I'll get them.

367
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:48,800
Just get the door.

368
00:44:05,996 --> 00:44:08,487
"But few of them really
are justified...

369
00:44:08,832 --> 00:44:10,993
"...if you get right down to the point.

370
00:44:12,002 --> 00:44:15,995
"You've heard of a woman's glory
being spent on a downright cur."

371
00:44:16,506 --> 00:44:17,996
Did you write all that yourself?

372
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:20,673
Do you want to hear this or not?

373
00:44:22,846 --> 00:44:26,509
"Still you can't always
judge the story as true...

374
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,681
"...being told by her.

375
00:44:31,521 --> 00:44:34,183
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

376
00:44:34,524 --> 00:44:36,856
"...though her features
were coarse and tough."

377
00:44:37,194 --> 00:44:38,024
I knew that old gal.

378
00:44:38,528 --> 00:44:41,520
She was cock-eyed and she
had a hare lip and no teeth.

379
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,866
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

380
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:50,203
"...though her features
were coarse and tough.

381
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,874
"She never once faltered from
duty, to play on the up and up.

382
00:44:56,379 --> 00:44:59,212
"Sal told me this tale on the evening...

383
00:44:59,716 --> 00:45:01,707
"...before she was turned out free.

384
00:45:02,552 --> 00:45:06,215
"And I'll do my best to relate it,
just as she told it to me.

385
00:45:06,556 --> 00:45:10,549
Hey! The laws are outside!
They're blocking the driveway.

386
00:45:25,742 --> 00:45:28,074
- Please get us out of here.
- Shut up!

387
00:45:30,247 --> 00:45:32,408
They got us blocked.
We've got to get the car out.

388
00:46:13,456 --> 00:46:14,616
Where's Blanche?

389
00:46:34,644 --> 00:46:36,805
You almost got us killed!

390
00:46:37,647 --> 00:46:41,310
What did I do wrong? I thought
you'd be happy if I got shot!

391
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:44,984
Yeah! It would have saved
us all a lot of trouble!

392
00:46:45,655 --> 00:46:47,145
Don't let that woman
talk to me like that!

393
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:49,481
You shouldn't have done that.
It was a dumb thing to do.

394
00:46:51,795 --> 00:46:54,821
Oh, Buck, please, I didn't marry
you to see you get shot.

395
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,657
Let's leave. Let's get out
of here and leave.

396
00:46:58,735 --> 00:47:00,327
Tell him to please stop
the car and let us out.

397
00:47:02,839 --> 00:47:04,329
I killed a guy. Now we're in this.

398
00:47:06,843 --> 00:47:07,673
Will you shut up!

399
00:47:08,011 --> 00:47:09,501
Just shut up your big mouth!

400
00:47:09,846 --> 00:47:11,006
At least do that much.

401
00:47:11,348 --> 00:47:12,337
Cut it out, Bonnie!

402
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,179
Stop the car. I want to talk to you.

403
00:47:34,204 --> 00:47:35,364
Get rid of her.

404
00:47:35,705 --> 00:47:37,036
I can't, she's Buck's wife.

405
00:47:37,374 --> 00:47:38,363
Then, get rid of them both.

406
00:47:38,708 --> 00:47:39,868
Why? What's the matter
with you, anyway?

407
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:41,541
She is what's the matter with me.

408
00:47:41,878 --> 00:47:45,370
She's nothing but a dumb,
stupid, back-country hick.

409
00:47:46,549 --> 00:47:48,039
She ain't got a brain in her head.

410
00:47:48,385 --> 00:47:50,546
What makes you any better?
What makes you so damn special?

411
00:47:50,887 --> 00:47:54,050
You were just a West Dallas waitress.
Spent your time picking up truck drivers.

412
00:47:55,892 --> 00:47:59,384
Oh, big Clyde Barrow!
You're just like your brother!

413
00:47:59,896 --> 00:48:02,057
Ignorant, uneducated, hillbilly!

414
00:48:02,399 --> 00:48:05,732
Listen, the only special thing about you
is your peculiar ideas about love-making,

415
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:07,900
...which is no love-making at all.

416
00:48:20,917 --> 00:48:23,909
Oh, Clyde, please, I didn't mean that.

417
00:48:24,254 --> 00:48:27,917
Listen, it, it was just all,
all that shooting...

418
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:31,750
...and all those guns. I got so scared.
Please, I didn't mean it.

419
00:49:16,306 --> 00:49:17,796
"Law enforcement officers...

420
00:49:18,141 --> 00:49:20,974

We ain't going to see another
toilet for another thirty miles.

440
00:50:24,641 --> 00:50:26,040
Why don't you pull up
over here?

441
00:50:38,454 --> 00:50:39,546
Here's something.

442
00:50:41,224 --> 00:50:43,055
"Lone cop arrests two

All right, now you just get
on right over to that car.

454
00:51:54,964 --> 00:51:58,297
Look here. We're in the custody
of Captain Frank Hamer...

455
00:51:58,635 --> 00:52:00,967
Frank here is a Texas Ranger.

456
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:05,630
Say, peace-maker, I believe you got
your spurs all tangled up there.

457
00:52:06,476 --> 00:52:07,966
You're in Missouri, do you
know that, friend?

458
00:52:09,145 --> 00:52:10,806
He's lost, this Texas Ranger.

459
00:52:11,814 --> 00:52:12,872
I don't think he's lost.

460
00:52:12,949 --> 00:52:14,143
Those banks have been offering
extra reward money for us...

461
00:52:14,484 --> 00:52:17,476
...and I think Frank just
figured on some easy pickings.

462
00:52:18,821 --> 00:52:20,311
You know, Texas Ranger, you
ain't hardly doing your job.

463
00:52:21,324 --> 00:52:23,087
You ought to be home
protecting the rights of poor folk...

464
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:24,649
...not out chasing after us.

465
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,831
Why do you want to take
it so personal for?

466
00:52:33,169 --> 00:52:37,162
We've got to discourage this bounty
hunting for the Barrow Gang.

467
00:52:40,343 --> 00:52:41,674
What do you want to do
with him then?

468
00:52:42,512 --> 00:52:43,501
Shoot him?

469
00:52:48,685 --> 00:52:49,845
Hang him.

470
00:52:50,186 --> 00:52:52,347
Take his picture.

471
00:52:55,692 --> 00:52:57,353
Listen, we take his picture...

472
00:52:57,694 --> 00:52:59,184
...we'll send it to all the newspapers.

473
00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:01,520
And then everybody's going to
see Captain Frank Hamer...

474
00:53:01,698 --> 00:53:03,188
...of the Texas Rangers
with the Barrow Gang...

475
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:05,865
...and all of us just
as friendly as pie.

476
00:53:06,869 --> 00:53:11,033
We are just about the friendliest
folks you'd ever want to meet.

477
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:16,202
Big old Texas Ranger
waves his gun at us...

478
00:53:16,546 --> 00:53:20,038
...and we just welcome him
like he was one of our own.

479
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:23,379
Buck, get the Kodak.

480
00:53:31,194 --> 00:53:33,890
See what came of your
mischief not doing your job?

481
00:53:34,564 --> 00:53:36,896
Down in Duncanville
last year...

482
00:53:37,233 --> 00:53:40,066
...poor farmers kept you laws
away from us with shotguns.

483
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:41,961
Now you're supposed to be
protecting them from us...

484
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:44,073
...and they're protecting us from you.

485
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,400
That don't make sense, do it?

486
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:57,075
When his Texas Ranger friends see
this, he's going to wish he was dead.

487
00:53:57,420 --> 00:53:59,752
I'm mighty proud to have a
Texas Ranger in the family.

488
00:54:03,426 --> 00:54:04,757
How's this?

489
00:54:39,629 --> 00:54:42,291
We're going to put that picture
in every paper in the country!

490
00:54:52,809 --> 00:54:56,142
We got you!
You just stay there for a while.

491
00:55:01,484 --> 00:55:02,473
We got you!

492
00:55:21,003 --> 00:55:23,494
Good afternoon.
This is the Barrow Gang.

493
00:55:24,674 --> 00:55:27,165
If everybody will just take
it easy, nobody will get hurt.

494
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:41,850
Is that your money or the bank's?

495
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:43,188
Mine.

496
00:55:43,693 --> 00:55:45,354
You keep it then.

497
00:55:50,032 --> 00:55:52,023
Next time, I'll aim a
little lower.

498
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:16,714
Take a good look, Pop.
I'm Buck Barrow.

499
00:56:19,896 --> 00:56:21,227
We're the Barrow boys.

500
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:29,560
Happy birthday, hon.

501
00:56:43,252 --> 00:56:47,245
It was the Barrow Gang, Charlie.
They're headed for Oklahoma.

502
00:57:09,445 --> 00:57:10,434
Load this!

503
00:57:30,299 --> 00:57:33,632
There I was, staring square
into the face of death.

504
00:57:59,328 --> 00:58:02,820
And all I can say is
they did right by me.

505
00:58:03,666 --> 00:58:06,658
And I'm bringing me a mess
of flowers to their funeral.

506
00:58:35,531 --> 00:58:37,192
Slow down, we're in Oklahoma now!

507
00:58:40,870 --> 00:58:42,360
Come on, let's catch them, anyway.

508
00:58:44,707 --> 00:58:46,368
I'm not going to risk
my life in Oklahoma.

509
00:59:10,066 --> 00:59:11,192
Ain't much, is it?

510
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:12,556
Well, times are hard.

511
00:59:14,703 --> 00:59:16,864
Let's get down to it.

512
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:33,582
I want my share.

513
00:59:35,891 --> 00:59:38,223
If Bonnie gets a share,
I want a share, too.

514
00:59:38,594 --> 00:59:39,891
What are you talking about?

515
00:59:40,229 --> 00:59:41,389
Tell Clyde I want my share.

516
00:59:48,104 --> 00:59:49,093
What about Blanche here?

517
00:59:51,407 --> 00:59:52,396
Well, why not?

518
00:59:56,112 --> 00:59:59,104
I earn my share same
as everybody.

519
00:59:59,415 --> 01:00:01,349
I could have got killed
same as everybody,

520
01:00:01,417 --> 01:00:02,907
...and I'm wanted by the law
same as everybody.

521
01:00:03,752 --> 01:00:06,619
Besides I could have got snake-bit
sleeping in those woods every night.

522
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:09,121
I'm a nervous wreck and
that's the truth...

523
01:00:10,759 --> 01:00:13,922
...and I have to take sass from
Miss Bonnie Parker all the time.

524
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:15,260
I deserve mine!

525
01:00:15,631 --> 01:00:17,622
Hold on, Blanche, hold your horses,
you're going to get your share.

526
01:00:26,642 --> 01:00:29,941
I married the preacher's daughter and she
thinks she's still taking up a collection.

527
01:00:36,152 --> 01:00:38,143
Don't spend it
all in one place!

528
01:00:45,461 --> 01:00:47,952
I guess I'm going to have
to keep saying this...

529
01:00:48,664 --> 01:00:50,962
...Blanche is married to
Buck, and Buck is family.

530
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:53,962
My family could use some of that money.

531
01:00:54,303 --> 01:00:55,395
Now you know how those laws...

532
01:00:55,538 --> 01:00:56,835
...have been hanging around
your mama's house till all hours.

533
01:00:56,939 --> 01:00:57,928
It's too risky to go up there now.

534
01:00:58,474 --> 01:01:01,807
But where can we go now? We rob
the damn banks. What else do we do?

535
01:01:01,944 --> 01:01:03,343
What do you want to do?

536
01:01:03,512 --> 01:01:04,672
There's a hole in the pan.

537
01:01:05,181 --> 01:01:07,672
We're losing oil. We've got to swipe
another car if we want to get anywhere.

538
01:01:07,750 --> 01:01:09,012
C'mon and look.

539
01:01:35,711 --> 01:01:37,838
Isn't that your car, Eugene?

540
01:01:38,714 --> 01:01:40,011
That's my car!

541
01:01:45,854 --> 01:01:47,344
That's my car!

542
01:01:50,726 --> 01:01:51,818
That's my car.

543
01:02:08,744 --> 01:02:11,372
- They're coming after us!
- Come on, kick it in the pants.

544
01:02:11,747 --> 01:02:15,376
I'm going to tear them apart.
Those punks.

545
01:02:16,385 --> 01:02:17,875
Stealing a man's car.

546
01:02:19,388 --> 01:02:21,754
Wait till I get my hands
on those kids, Velma.

547
01:02:22,258 --> 01:02:24,249
I'm going to tear them apart.

548
01:02:26,061 --> 01:02:28,052
What if they have guns, Eugene?

549
01:02:30,566 --> 01:02:33,057
Listen, we better get the police
and let them handle this.

550
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,698
All right, now, turn around.
Turn around and let's go back to town.

551
01:02:37,773 --> 01:02:39,604
Then we'll go get the sheriff.

552
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,571
They stopped chasing us.
They're turning around there.

553
01:02:49,918 --> 01:02:51,283
Let's take them.

554
01:02:58,093 --> 01:03:00,288
Oh, my Lord, they're coming after us.

555
01:03:01,597 --> 01:03:03,087
Step on it, Velma.

556
01:03:09,104 --> 01:03:10,799
What do you want to do that for?

557
01:03:11,307 --> 01:03:14,435
Step on it, Velma. Step on it.

558
01:03:36,832 --> 01:03:38,629
What are you doing in there?

559
01:03:53,849 --> 01:03:55,976
All right, get on out of there.
Come on.

560
01:03:57,986 --> 01:03:59,647
You want to go for a
little ride in our new car?

561
01:04:01,490 --> 01:04:03,151
Can we all fit in there?

562
01:04:10,532 --> 01:04:12,363
There's not room for me in there.

563
01:04:25,714 --> 01:04:26,703
What's your names?

564
01:04:29,184 --> 01:04:32,381
I'm Eugene Griz- I'm Eugene Grizzard.

565
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:37,014
We're the Barrow Gang.

566
01:04:42,197 --> 01:04:46,531
Now listen, now don't be scared.
It ain't like you was the law or anything.

567
01:04:46,902 --> 01:04:49,097
I mean, you're just folks,
just like us. That's all.

568
01:04:49,405 --> 01:04:51,703
That's the truth.

569
01:04:54,042 --> 01:04:55,532
I expect you've been
reading about us.

570
01:05:01,550 --> 01:05:02,539
We have, too.

571
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:08,421
You two must
be in love, I bet.

572
01:05:13,228 --> 01:05:14,217
When are you going
to marry the girl?

573
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:27,072
He gave her the milk, and
she drank a little bit of it.

574
01:05:27,443 --> 01:05:31,743
The next day, he gave her some more.
She drank some more till a week goes by.

575
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,243
And he brings her the milk and she
drinks down every drop of it.

576
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:37,745
And she looks at her son
and she calls him over and she says...

577
01:05:38,086 --> 01:05:42,079
"...Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow."

578
01:05:57,973 --> 01:06:01,636
I'm from Wisconsin originally.
Where the cheese comes from.

579
01:06:03,145 --> 01:06:06,478
Oh, but he just loves Texas now.
Don't you, Eugene?

580
01:06:06,815 --> 01:06:07,804
"Don't sell that cow."

581
01:06:10,819 --> 01:06:11,649
How old are you?

582
01:06:12,321 --> 01:06:13,310
I'm thirty-three.

583
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,673
Didn't I order some
French fries?

584
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,841
You did. Here you are.

585
01:06:41,016 --> 01:06:44,179
Take it easy on those French fries.
Ain't that right, Eugene?

586
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,181
This isn't mine.

587
01:06:46,855 --> 01:06:49,187
I ordered mine well done.
Who's got the other hamburger?

588
01:06:52,694 --> 01:06:54,184
Is this supposed to be yours?

589
01:06:58,534 --> 01:07:00,024
It's okay. Forget it.

590
01:07:01,537 --> 01:07:02,526
I'm sure having a good time.

591
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:05,870
Aren't you glad we picked you up?

592
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:08,203
You're a grand host, Buck.

593
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:10,367
Maybe you all ought to join up with us.

594
01:07:14,716 --> 01:07:18,049
They sure would be surprised
to hear that back home.

595
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:21,382
What would Bill and Martha
say if they heard that?

596
01:07:21,723 --> 01:07:24,214
Lordy, they would have a fit!

597
01:07:25,561 --> 01:07:27,392
What do you do, anyhow?

598
01:07:28,897 --> 01:07:30,228
I'm an undertaker.

599
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:36,894
Get them out of here.

600
01:08:06,935 --> 01:08:08,425
I don't see her, Clyde.

601
01:08:09,605 --> 01:08:11,095
Bonnie, where are you?

602
01:08:23,619 --> 01:08:24,608
Where do you think she
could have went, Buck?

603
01:08:24,953 --> 01:08:27,945
I don't know. I just don't know.

604
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:35,619
There!

605
01:08:51,313 --> 01:08:52,803
Leave me alone!

606
01:08:53,148 --> 01:08:54,479
Where are you going?

607
01:08:54,816 --> 01:08:55,976
Get away!

608
01:09:02,157 --> 01:09:03,818
I want to see my mama.

609
01:09:04,993 --> 01:09:06,324
I want to see my mama.

610
01:09:06,828 --> 01:09:10,320
Please, honey, don't ever leave me
without saying nothing.

611
01:09:19,508 --> 01:09:22,500
Clyde, listen to me. Clyde, please.

612
01:09:23,178 --> 01:09:25,009
Now, listen. I mean it.

613
01:09:25,347 --> 01:09:27,679
I've been thinking about my mama...

614
01:09:28,684 --> 01:09:31,676
...and she's getting so old,
and I want to see her.

615
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:34,678
You'll see her.

616
01:10:08,724 --> 01:10:10,385
Would you look at him?

617
01:10:12,728 --> 01:10:13,717
He just don't remember me.

618
01:10:16,565 --> 01:10:18,055
He'll get used to me, won't he?

619
01:10:19,401 --> 01:10:21,733
We've been cutting and pasting
everything we could find about you.

620
01:10:22,571 --> 01:10:24,562
Clyde, there's the shot I took of you.

621
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,730
Came out real fine, didn't it?

622
01:11:02,277 --> 01:11:05,269
"Horsey, get your tail up.
Why don't you make it rise?"

623
01:11:07,115 --> 01:11:10,107
Oh, Lord, we thank you for
the safety of our loved ones.

624
01:11:10,952 --> 01:11:13,113
And the food we are
about to receive. Amen.

625
01:11:34,810 --> 01:11:36,971
Where you all headed
to from here, Clyde?

626
01:11:37,312 --> 01:11:39,974
At this point we ain't heading to
nowhere. We're just running from.

627
01:11:53,995 --> 01:11:57,487
Mama, why don't you stay
a little longer.

628
01:11:59,334 --> 01:12:01,165
Listen, I want you to have this.

629
01:12:11,179 --> 01:12:13,170
Listen, make mama stay a while yet?

630
01:12:13,515 --> 01:12:17,508
Clyde, I read about
you all in the papers...

631
01:12:17,853 --> 01:12:21,016
...and I just get scared.

632
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:25,182
Mrs. Parker, don't you believe what
you read in all those newspapers.

633
01:12:25,527 --> 01:12:26,858
That's the laws talking there.

634
01:12:27,195 --> 01:12:29,527
They want us to look big so they're
going to look big when they catch us.

635
01:12:30,365 --> 01:12:31,696
And they ain't going to catch us.

636
01:12:32,033 --> 01:12:33,864
Because I'm even better at running
than I am at robbing banks.

637
01:12:34,703 --> 01:12:37,171
If we did half that stuff they
say we did in those papers,

638
01:12:37,205 --> 01:12:38,194
...we'd be millionaires
by now, wouldn't we?

639
01:12:40,709 --> 01:12:43,200
I ain't going to risk my little
girl here just to make money,

640
01:12:43,378 --> 01:12:44,709
...uncertain as times are.

641
01:12:45,714 --> 01:12:47,045
I knew, of a job...

642
01:12:48,216 --> 01:12:49,808
You remember the time.
I could have...

643
01:12:49,885 --> 01:12:51,716
...we could have got $2,000
just as easy as pie.

644
01:12:53,054 --> 01:12:56,546
I pulled up outside there
and I saw them laws...

645
01:12:57,225 --> 01:13:00,058
...and I said to myself,
"Bonnie could get hurt here."

646
01:13:01,062 --> 01:13:03,553
So we just drove right on
and I let that money lay.

647
01:13:04,232 --> 01:13:05,893
Maybe you know the way with her, then.

648
01:13:06,234 --> 01:13:08,896
I'm just an old woman
and I don't know nothing.

649
01:13:09,571 --> 01:13:12,904
But Mrs. Parker, this here is the
way we know best how to make money.

650
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:15,209
But we're going to be quitting all this
as soon as hard times are over,

651
01:13:15,243 --> 01:13:16,232
I can tell you that.

652
01:13:17,412 --> 01:13:19,573
Just the other night,
me and Bonnie were talking...

653
01:13:19,915 --> 01:13:22,748
about the time we were going
to settle down and get a home.

654
01:13:25,086 --> 01:13:29,079
She says, to me.
"You know, I couldn't bear...

655
01:13:29,758 --> 01:13:32,750
...to live more than 3 miles
from my precious mother."

656
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:34,926
How do you like
that, Mother Parker?

657
01:13:35,931 --> 01:13:37,922
I don't believe I would.

658
01:13:41,603 --> 01:13:44,766
You try to live 3 miles from me
and you won't live long.

659
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:49,604
You best keep running, Clyde Barrow.

660
01:13:50,111 --> 01:13:51,271
And you know it.

661
01:13:56,117 --> 01:13:57,448
Bye, baby.

662
01:14:23,211 --> 01:14:25,406
Look, who is this here,
is that your girlfriend?

663
01:14:27,482 --> 01:14:28,972
"L, o, v, e."

664
01:14:29,651 --> 01:14:31,642
Whose idea was
it to get bluebirds?

665
01:14:31,987 --> 01:14:34,478
Bonnie's. Bonnie picked it out.

666
01:14:35,824 --> 01:14:37,485
Day after we robbed the armory.

667
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:41,992
I want you to touch
something here. Ah...

668
01:14:42,831 --> 01:14:45,163
I want you just to
touch it right there.

669
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:55,173
Why don't you all go
into your own cabin...

670
01:14:55,510 --> 01:14:57,671
...if you want to play with C.W.?

671
01:14:58,013 --> 01:15:00,846
What's the matter with you now,
besides your nasty disposition?

672
01:15:03,685 --> 01:15:05,016
Wait now. Hold on!

673
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:11,022
I saw a chicken place a few miles back.
Who all wants to get some food?

674
01:15:11,493 --> 01:15:13,688
I certainly do. I'm sick to
death of sitting around here.

675
01:15:14,029 --> 01:15:15,860
Why, you can't even
drive the car.

676
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:19,530
Just get us 5 chicken dinners.

677
01:15:22,537 --> 01:15:26,200
Get some dessert there, too. Some
peach ice cream or something.

678
01:15:51,566 --> 01:15:55,559
I've got the blues so bad.

679
01:16:05,914 --> 01:16:07,404
Is it what your mama said?

680
01:16:12,087 --> 01:16:13,748
What mama?

681
01:16:17,092 --> 01:16:18,923
She's just an old woman now.

682
01:16:21,096 --> 01:16:22,757
I don't have no mama.

683
01:16:26,267 --> 01:16:27,598
No family either.

684
01:16:31,439 --> 01:16:32,770
I'm your family.

685
01:16:48,957 --> 01:16:51,289
When we started out...

686
01:16:51,626 --> 01:16:54,459
...I thought we were
really going somewhere.

687
01:16:57,298 --> 01:16:58,629
But this is it.

688
01:17:01,803 --> 01:17:03,464
We're just going.

689
01:17:06,808 --> 01:17:07,968
I love you.

690
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:24,151
You sure are smoking a lot lately.

691
01:17:24,492 --> 01:17:25,322
So what?

692
01:17:34,002 --> 01:17:35,663
Why don't you go back
to your pa's house?

693
01:17:38,673 --> 01:17:39,833
If I only could.

694
01:17:41,176 --> 01:17:43,337
If I could only just do that one thing.

695
01:17:46,347 --> 01:17:48,508
There's no telling
how all this happened.

696
01:17:49,851 --> 01:17:51,682
I was a preacher's daughter.

697
01:17:54,022 --> 01:17:56,013
What church was your pa affiliated with?

698
01:17:56,357 --> 01:17:57,187
Baptist.

699
01:18:05,700 --> 01:18:08,191
He thought the world
of Buck, my daddy did.

700
01:18:09,037 --> 01:18:11,528
Even though Buck was
serving time in jail.

701
01:18:14,209 --> 01:18:17,372
He forgave him because he
paid his debt to society.

702
01:18:20,048 --> 01:18:21,709
We were Disciples of Christ.

703
01:18:33,228 --> 01:18:35,389
I have no money.
Give me some.

704
01:18:56,584 --> 01:18:58,074
Get me Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

705
01:19:00,755 --> 01:19:02,916
"I love to spend...

706
01:19:04,259 --> 01:19:06,591
"...each Sunday with you.

707
01:19:07,095 --> 01:19:08,756
"As friend to friend...

708
01:19:10,265 --> 01:19:12,756
"...l'm sorry it's through."

709
01:19:15,603 --> 01:19:17,264
That's more like it.

710
01:19:17,772 --> 01:19:19,603
Look how much better it
fits since I took it up.

711
01:19:29,284 --> 01:19:30,615
The men are on the other side.

712
01:20:47,528 --> 01:20:48,517
Hold it, hold it!

713
01:20:48,863 --> 01:20:49,852
Get out!

714
01:22:02,103 --> 01:22:04,435
Give me a gun! Somebody, give
me a gun. I don't have a gun.

715
01:22:09,777 --> 01:22:12,769
Be quiet! Please, be quiet!
We're trying to get out.

716
01:22:38,806 --> 01:22:41,798
It didn't happen, Daddy.
I know it.

717
01:22:43,978 --> 01:22:45,138
Stop that!

718
01:23:05,166 --> 01:23:07,498
I'd rather go to jail,
than go on like this.

719
01:23:10,338 --> 01:23:12,499
He ain't got a chance.
Half his head's blown off.

720
01:23:16,677 --> 01:23:20,169
Dear Lord, it's happened.
Please help us.

721
01:23:21,182 --> 01:23:24,174
And Buck will never do anything
wrong again in his life.

722
01:23:28,189 --> 01:23:29,850
My eyes.

723
01:23:31,192 --> 01:23:33,023
I think I'm blind!

724
01:23:33,528 --> 01:23:35,018
My eyes!

725
01:23:36,030 --> 01:23:37,691
The light hurts so bad!

726
01:23:45,873 --> 01:23:47,534
Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.

727
01:23:48,376 --> 01:23:50,367
Bonnie! We're dying!

728
01:23:50,878 --> 01:23:53,210
Buck can't be moved now.

729
01:24:00,888 --> 01:24:02,719
I believe I lost my shoes, Clyde.

730
01:24:04,559 --> 01:24:06,220
I think the dog got them.

731
01:24:42,263 --> 01:24:42,922
Surrender!

732
01:24:43,931 --> 01:24:45,262
In the car! Come on!

733
01:24:48,603 --> 01:24:49,592
Keep low!

734
01:25:15,796 --> 01:25:18,959
Cross fire! Keep low!

735
01:25:36,651 --> 01:25:39,643
Charlie, don't shoot!
The kids are in the cross fire!

736
01:25:39,987 --> 01:25:41,978
I'll go get the car.

737
01:25:42,990 --> 01:25:43,979
Hey, Buck, this way.

738
01:25:46,827 --> 01:25:50,820
They're heading for the other car!
Shoot it! Knock the hell out of it!

739
01:26:13,688 --> 01:26:15,155
Hold your fire!

740
01:26:16,023 --> 01:26:17,354
Daddy, don't die!

741
01:26:21,195 --> 01:26:24,858
Get away and leave him alone.
He's dying. Can't you see he's dying?

742
01:26:25,199 --> 01:26:26,689
Let me go! Daddy!

743
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:31,198
You've killed him! He's dying!
God, can't you see him dying?

744
01:27:28,763 --> 01:27:29,752
Maybe...

745
01:29:15,369 --> 01:29:18,702
Can you all spare us
some drinking water?

746
01:29:19,206 --> 01:29:20,195
Who are you, boy?

747
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:22,039
My name is Moss.

748
01:30:00,581 --> 01:30:02,412
That's Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker.

749
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:04,081
What happened to them?

750
01:30:08,255 --> 01:30:09,244
Are they fainting?

751
01:30:29,944 --> 01:30:31,775
Is that really Bonnie Parker?

752
01:31:04,144 --> 01:31:05,133
Daddy, daddy!

753
01:31:07,815 --> 01:31:09,305
- Who's there?
- C.W.

754
01:31:12,152 --> 01:31:14,985
Oh, it's good to see you, boy.
It's good to see you.

755
01:31:15,322 --> 01:31:16,653
What's that on your chest, there?

756
01:31:16,991 --> 01:31:17,821
Tattoo, daddy. Come on.

757
01:31:20,494 --> 01:31:21,483
You've got to help them.

758
01:31:24,164 --> 01:31:25,324
Help me get them in.

759
01:31:27,001 --> 01:31:29,492
What happened to them?
Are you in trouble, son?

760
01:31:34,274 --> 01:31:35,502
Help me get 'em in.

761
01:31:45,853 --> 01:31:48,344
How come you marked yourself
all up with that tattoo?

762
01:31:49,523 --> 01:31:51,855
What the hell made you do a
damn fool thing like that?

763
01:32:07,708 --> 01:32:09,699
I came here to question Blanche Barrow.

764
01:32:10,377 --> 01:32:11,366
So you're the Frank Hammer?

765
01:32:15,382 --> 01:32:18,044
Hamer. I figure to have my picture
taken with those two...

766
01:32:18,385 --> 01:32:20,216
...just one more time.

767
01:32:20,888 --> 01:32:23,823
It says here: "Clyde fled
his dying brother."

768
01:32:23,891 --> 01:32:25,051
Where? What do they mean "fled"?

769
01:32:25,726 --> 01:32:29,218
How could I leave my brother to die, when
he was already dead when I left him?

770
01:32:30,230 --> 01:32:31,390
Fled!

771
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:33,889
Newspapers!

772
01:32:35,069 --> 01:32:37,060
While we're all lying
around here near dead,

773
01:32:37,104 --> 01:32:39,402
...they had us holding up the
Grand Prairie National Bank.

774
01:32:39,907 --> 01:32:41,397
Guess they hung that
one on us just for luck.

775
01:32:43,243 --> 01:32:47,236
As soon as we get well, we're going to
hold up that bank. We're going to take it.

776
01:33:00,260 --> 01:33:02,421
They don't know nothing, do they?

777
01:33:03,764 --> 01:33:05,755
How come they always referring
to me, the newspapers as...

778
01:33:06,100 --> 01:33:09,592
...unidentified suspect?

779
01:33:09,937 --> 01:33:11,427
You just be glad that's all you are.

780
01:33:11,772 --> 01:33:13,262
Long as they don't know your last name.

781
01:33:13,607 --> 01:33:17,099
That's right, boy. Mr. Barrow's
looking out for your interests.

782
01:33:20,447 --> 01:33:21,436
Hey, pa.

783
01:33:22,282 --> 01:33:25,445
How's it feel to have a couple of
big deals stay in your house?

784
01:33:25,786 --> 01:33:27,447
Ain't that something for me.
That's something for me?

785
01:33:27,788 --> 01:33:29,449
You've been mighty nice to us.

786
01:33:30,290 --> 01:33:34,954
I want you to let us pay you,
say, $40 for your hospitality.

787
01:33:38,298 --> 01:33:39,788
I'm just happy to have
you folks here as company.

788
01:33:40,968 --> 01:33:42,799
Anybody's a friend of
my boy, you know I...

789
01:33:43,137 --> 01:33:44,968
Come on, let's go have some supper.
I'm starving. Come on.

790
01:33:47,474 --> 01:33:49,465
You're all welcome here.
You know that.

791
01:33:51,311 --> 01:33:54,644
And you just make yourself right at
home and stay as long as you want to.

792
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:05,989
You look like trash,
all marked up like that.

793
01:34:08,328 --> 01:34:09,317
Cheap trash!

794
01:34:11,999 --> 01:34:13,489
Bonnie says it looks good.

795
01:34:15,169 --> 01:34:18,002
What does Bonnie know? She ain't
nothing but cheap trash herself.

796
01:34:18,338 --> 01:34:20,829
Look what they do to you. You don't
ever get your name in the paper.

797
01:34:21,508 --> 01:34:24,170
You just get them pictures printed
on your skin by Bonnie and Clyde.

798
01:34:24,511 --> 01:34:26,672
They ain't nothing
but a couple of kids.

799
01:34:29,349 --> 01:34:32,341
I'm so glad your ma ain't alive
to see this here thing...

800
01:34:35,189 --> 01:34:36,679
...all jellied up like that!

801
01:34:38,859 --> 01:34:42,022
I don't see what's so bad about it.

802
01:34:43,697 --> 01:34:44,527
You wouldn't!

803
01:34:50,204 --> 01:34:53,696
The word is out that Bonnie and
Clyde are holed up just out of town.

804
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:57,041
And they're fixing to bust in
here and take Blanche out.

805
01:34:58,679 --> 01:35:00,203
All two of them?

806
01:35:24,404 --> 01:35:25,393
Who is it?

807
01:35:35,916 --> 01:35:39,750
I guess it's been kind of
rough on you.

808
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:45,752
Being the daughter of a
preacher, like you are.

809
01:35:57,771 --> 01:36:01,434
I imagine old Buck wasn't
a bad sort, was he?

810
01:36:02,109 --> 01:36:03,269
No, he wasn't.

811
01:36:05,112 --> 01:36:06,101
I reckon...

812
01:36:07,781 --> 01:36:09,271
...Clyde just sort of...

813
01:36:10,784 --> 01:36:12,615
...led him astray, didn't he?

814
01:36:22,796 --> 01:36:24,787
That's a shame, Blanche.

815
01:36:29,469 --> 01:36:31,300
Yes, ma'am.

816
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:33,802
That's a shame.

817
01:36:34,641 --> 01:36:36,973
That he led your Buck away.

818
01:36:37,978 --> 01:36:40,139
Clyde, his own brother, Bonnie...

819
01:36:43,650 --> 01:36:44,810
And that little feller.

820
01:36:46,820 --> 01:36:50,153
The one that was with you when you
took that Texas Ranger in Missouri.

821
01:36:53,994 --> 01:36:56,155
He was with you all along, wasn't he?

822
01:37:04,004 --> 01:37:05,164
That's right.

823
01:37:12,346 --> 01:37:14,337
I don't recollect his last name.

824
01:37:21,355 --> 01:37:23,016
He was there that day we met them.

825
01:37:23,357 --> 01:37:26,349
I didn't want to go. I didn't want to.

826
01:37:27,527 --> 01:37:31,019
And Buck said we were just
going on a visit...

827
01:37:31,531 --> 01:37:34,193
...so we wouldn't do no
stealing or robbing.

828
01:37:36,536 --> 01:37:39,027
And we went up to Joplin,
and all of a sudden...

829
01:37:40,374 --> 01:37:43,537
...all of a sudden, they
all just started shooting.

830
01:37:54,054 --> 01:37:55,043
What're you writing?

831
01:37:56,223 --> 01:37:58,555
I'm writing a poem about us.

832
01:38:00,060 --> 01:38:01,049
Let me hear it.

833
01:38:04,064 --> 01:38:05,395
Just let me finish this line.

834
01:38:10,404 --> 01:38:12,565
It's called "The Story
of Bonnie and Clyde."

835
01:38:13,407 --> 01:38:17,400
"You've heard the story of Jesse
James, of how he lived and died.

836
01:38:18,078 --> 01:38:20,740
"If you're still in need
of something to read...

837
01:38:21,081 --> 01:38:22,912
"...here's the story
of Bonnie and Clyde."

838
01:38:24,251 --> 01:38:26,742
You think if I sent that into
the newspaper, they'd print it?

839
01:38:29,256 --> 01:38:30,416
I'm going to do it.

840
01:38:31,758 --> 01:38:34,249
"Now Bonnie and Clyde
are the Barrow Gang.

841
01:38:34,594 --> 01:38:37,927
"I'm sure you all have read
how they rob and steal...

842
01:38:38,265 --> 01:38:41,098
"...and those who squeal are
usually found dying or dead.

843
01:38:42,269 --> 01:38:44,100
"They call them cold-hearted killers.

844
01:38:46,273 --> 01:38:48,434
"They say they are heartless and mean.

845
01:38:48,942 --> 01:38:52,776
"But I say this with pride,
that I once knew Clyde...

846
01:38:53,113 --> 01:38:55,775
"...when he was honest
and upright and clean.

847
01:38:56,283 --> 01:38:59,275
"But the laws fooled around,
kept taking him down...

848
01:38:59,619 --> 01:39:01,280
"...and locking him up in a cell.

849
01:39:01,955 --> 01:39:06,449
"Till he said to me, 'I'll never be free,
so I'll meet a few of them in hell.'

850
01:39:07,127 --> 01:39:11,791
"If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
and they have no clue to guide.

851
01:39:12,299 --> 01:39:15,462
"If they can't find a fiend,
they just wipe their slate clean...

852
01:39:15,969 --> 01:39:17,960
"...and hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

853
01:39:18,805 --> 01:39:20,966
"If they try to act like citizens...

854
01:39:21,475 --> 01:39:23,807
"...and rent them a nice little flat...

855
01:39:24,311 --> 01:39:27,474
"...about the third night,
they're invited to fight...

856
01:39:27,814 --> 01:39:29,475
"...by a sub-gun's rat-a-tat-tat.

857
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:32,811
"Someday they'll go down together.

858
01:39:32,986 --> 01:39:34,647
"They'll bury them side by side.

859
01:39:35,155 --> 01:39:36,645
"To few it will be grief...

860
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:38,480
"...to the law a relief...

861
01:39:38,658 --> 01:39:40,649
"...but it's death
for Bonnie and Clyde."

862
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,991
You know what you've done there?
You told my story.

863
01:39:50,837 --> 01:39:52,327
You told my whole story right there.

864
01:39:55,509 --> 01:39:57,875
One time I told you I was gonna
make you somebody.

865
01:39:57,944 --> 01:39:58,672
That's what you've done for me.

866
01:40:00,013 --> 01:40:02,004
You made me somebody
they're going to remember.

867
01:41:39,946 --> 01:41:41,607
Hey, Bonnie, how do you feel?

868
01:41:42,282 --> 01:41:44,045
I mean, do you feel the way
you're supposed to feel...

869
01:41:44,184 --> 01:41:45,515
...when you're, when you're,
after you're...

870
01:41:45,619 --> 01:41:46,608
Yeah, just...

871
01:41:48,121 --> 01:41:50,783
That's good, isn't it?

872
01:41:52,459 --> 01:41:55,622
I figure that it's
a good idea to ask...

873
01:41:56,129 --> 01:41:57,289
...because how else are
you going to know if it...

874
01:42:00,133 --> 01:42:01,794
You did just perfect.

875
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:06,970
I did, didn't I?

876
01:42:09,976 --> 01:42:11,307
I mean, I really did.

877
01:42:13,146 --> 01:42:15,307
I never figured on that.

878
01:42:18,318 --> 01:42:21,151
Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

879
01:42:24,658 --> 01:42:26,489
To make an honest woman out of you.

880
01:42:31,665 --> 01:42:32,996
What would you do...

881
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,164
...what would you do if
some miracle happened...

882
01:42:40,006 --> 01:42:43,498
...and we could walk out of
here tomorrow morning...

883
01:42:43,843 --> 01:42:46,835
...and start all over again. Clean.

884
01:42:47,681 --> 01:42:51,014
With no record and nobody after us?

885
01:43:04,030 --> 01:43:05,691
I guess I'd do it all different.

886
01:43:09,703 --> 01:43:10,692
First off...

887
01:43:12,372 --> 01:43:15,034
...I wouldn't live in the same
state where we pull our jobs.

888
01:43:15,375 --> 01:43:18,538
We'd live in another state
and stay clean there.

889
01:43:18,878 --> 01:43:20,869
Then when we wanted to take a
bank, we'd go into the other state.

890
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:49,402
Did they expect you to go
downtown with them tomorrow?

891
01:43:49,509 --> 01:43:50,498
Who?

892
01:43:51,077 --> 01:43:52,567
Bonnie and Clyde, that's who.

893
01:43:52,912 --> 01:43:54,243
Sure. Always go with them.

894
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:02,911
You better go.

895
01:44:05,258 --> 01:44:07,920
But when they go to get in their
car to come on home,

896
01:44:08,261 --> 01:44:09,728
...don't you get back in there with them.

897
01:44:09,763 --> 01:44:10,752
Why, daddy?

898
01:44:10,930 --> 01:44:13,091
You listen to your pa for once,
can't you do that?

899
01:44:13,266 --> 01:44:15,427
I'm your pa. I'm your kin.
Not that there Clyde Barrow.

900
01:44:17,604 --> 01:44:20,095
What do you want me to tell them,
"I can't get back in the car with you?"

901
01:44:20,607 --> 01:44:22,268
You tell them nothing.

902
01:44:25,945 --> 01:44:28,607
I made a deal and got you
off with a couple of years.

903
01:44:29,949 --> 01:44:32,782
You just be sure that you're
off the streets in that town...

904
01:44:33,119 --> 01:44:34,950
...when they go to get in their car.

905
01:44:35,622 --> 01:44:37,613
You think laws is going to
catch Bonnie and Clyde in town?

906
01:44:38,458 --> 01:44:39,789
Clyde's got a sense.

907
01:44:40,126 --> 01:44:41,457
Don't you know that, daddy?

908
01:44:42,462 --> 01:44:45,795
Nobody catches Clyde. Never.

909
01:44:48,968 --> 01:44:49,957
Never!

910
01:45:21,167 --> 01:45:22,327
What happened to C.W.?

911
01:45:22,836 --> 01:45:26,169
He's over there in the hardware store,
getting some light bulbs for his daddy.

912
01:45:34,848 --> 01:45:36,179
You going to wear them like that?

913
01:45:36,683 --> 01:45:38,173
Drive with one eye closed.

914
01:45:40,186 --> 01:45:41,517
Want some ice cream?

915
01:45:42,188 --> 01:45:45,021
Look here. Isn't that just the
prettiest thing you ever saw?

916
01:45:45,358 --> 01:45:48,521
Look, you can see every fingernail
of her hand.

917
01:45:48,862 --> 01:45:50,523
That's the prettiest thing.
Where is that boy?

918
01:45:52,031 --> 01:45:53,020
Listen, I'll go get him.

919
01:46:26,733 --> 01:46:27,722
Gladys Jean!

920
01:46:28,568 --> 01:46:29,557
Time to go home now.

921
01:47:06,606 --> 01:47:08,938
Get back there in about 20
minutes and we'll pick him up.

922
01:47:11,945 --> 01:47:14,607
If that boy didn't have his head
strapped on him, he'd lose it.

923
01:47:42,308 --> 01:47:44,299
Isn't that Malcolm there?

924
01:48:05,498 --> 01:48:06,988
Got a flat tire. Ain't got no spare.

925
