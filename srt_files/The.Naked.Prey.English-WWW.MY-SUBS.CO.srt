1
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,960
A hundred years ago,
Africa was a vast, dark unknown.

2
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,770
Only a few explorers and missionaries...

3
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,540
the ivory hunters
and the infamous slave raiders...

4
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,170
risked their lives
on its blood-soaked trails.

5
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,980
Gleaming tusks were the prize...

6
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:05,110
and sweating slaves

7
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:08,350
sold by their own kings and chiefs
in the ceaseless tribal wars...

8
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:10,580
or seized by slavers.

9
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:16,360
The lion and the leopard hunted savagely
among the huge herds of game.

10
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,730
And man, lacking the will
to understand other men...

11
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,740
became like the beasts.

12
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,470
And their way of life was his.

13
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,420
Bring up the rear.

14
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,520
I've got a feeling about this safari.

15
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,600
We're going to make a killing.

16
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,670
Well, let's hope so.

17
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,300
I've been thinking.

18
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,900
After this,
I'd like to go into the slave trade.

19
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,410
Very lucrative.

20
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,480
Very, very lucrative.

21
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,480
Should go well with ivory.

22
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,550
Want to become a partner?

23
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:54,550
No, thanks.
Uh, this is my last time out.

24
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,850
After this, I'm settling on my farm.

25
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,020
Suit yourself, laddie,
but you're missing a big chance.

26
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:05,100
Ah, well, that happens.

27
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,150
No, you don't want that.

28
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,460
They're friendly.
Let's keep it that way.

29
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,970
What's he saying?
Where's that interpreter?

30
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,910
Oh, we don't need him.
I happen to know this dialect.

31
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:32,640
- What do they want?
- Well, it's the usual thing. Gifts for their chief.

32
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:35,020
No. Stay there.

33
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,020
I'm not giving them anything.

34
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,250
What the hell for?
Who says they own this land?

35
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,790
They've been here for generations.
Long enough to call it their own.

36
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,490
Anyway, it's customary,
and it's wise.

37
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,290
Let's get this understood.
I'm financing this safari, and I'm -

38
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,060
And I'm managing it.
That was the agreement.

39
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:51,140
Now, don't let's argue in front of them.

40
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,230
You can manage it.
But you're not giving my money away.

41
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,970
I paid for those goods
to be traded for ivory...

42
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,880
not to be given as handouts to every...
beggar who turns up on a jungle path.

43
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,880
Listen to me.
It's not worth it.

44
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,010
For a few trinkets, they'll let us alone. Otherwise,
they can give us a bad time. It's not worth it.

45
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,250
It's the principle of it. You give it to one,
and they'll come from miles around.

46
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,060
I know these chaps.
I've dealt with them before.

47
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,600
You're not the only one.
Let's get moving.

48
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,360
Don't be a bloody fool!
You're endangering the whole safari.

49
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:23,870
Get out of my way!

50
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,810
Did you see that brain shot
I made on that big bull?

51
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,020
Running too.

52
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,420
Let everybody eat
after they've cleaned one tusk.

53
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,500
Right, sir.

54
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,200
At an angle.

55
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,940
I got 14 of them. Not bad, huh?

56
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,670
- How many did you get?
- We're not in a contest.

57
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,740
Eleven.

58
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:15,680
That's how many, laddie.
Eleven to my 14.

59
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,120
All of mine were carrying ivory.

60
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,480
What is that supposed to mean?
That mine weren't?

61
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,890
Exactly. Five of them
weren't worth the gunpowder.

62
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:25,720
What the hell!

63
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:28,390
So I shot some of them for sport.

64
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,290
Have another drink.

65
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,000
Not for me.
I think we've both had enough.

66
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,500
We've got quite a few miles
to cover today.

67
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,370
Look, friend.
You're managing the safari, not me.

68
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,100
I'll have another.

69
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,870
Will you shut up!

70
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,240
Stop them over there!

71
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:14,280
Hey! Hey, you bastards!

72
00:57:14,390 --> 00:57:19,190
Hey, you devils! Hey!

73
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:24,200
Hey, you devils! Burn! Burn!

74
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,670
Burn! Burn, you devils!

75
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,680
Burn! Burn! Burn, you devils!

76
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:20,820
Oh, my God.

77
01:25:16,970 --> 01:25:18,870
Hmm?

78
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,880
Mmm. Mmm, mmm.

79
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,120
Mmm. Yum-yum.

80
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,590
Ah?

81
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:49,600
Aha!

82
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:51,800
- Zavoudi.
- Huh?

83
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:53,710
Zavoudi.

84
01:25:53,810 --> 01:25:56,640
Zavoudi?

85
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,650
Ah, zavoudi.

86
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:25,060
Well, that's very, uh, zava -

87
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:29,260
- Zavoudi.
- Zavoudi.

88
01:28:29,370 --> 01:28:31,800
Well.

89
01:28:31,900 --> 01:28:33,800
Here.

90
01:28:33,900 --> 01:28:36,430
This is for my little singer.

91
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:21,010
Zavoudi.

92
01:29:24,050 --> 01:29:26,040
Oh. You want to go home.

93
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,920
Uh -

94
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:38,000
Mm-hmm.

95
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,330
I hope you'll be all right.

96
01:29:41,570 --> 01:29:44,870
Here. I have a present for you.

97
01:29:44,970 --> 01:29:46,870
Zavoudi.

98
01:29:46,980 --> 01:29:50,340
Zavoudi. Hmm?

99
01:34:01,360 --> 01:34:04,390
Number One Company.
