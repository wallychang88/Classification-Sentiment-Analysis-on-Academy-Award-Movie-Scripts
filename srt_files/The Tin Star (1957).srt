1
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:57,530
Just getting the feel of these guns.

2
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:00,399
Where's the sheriff?

3
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:09,114
Sheriff.

4
00:04:14,757 --> 00:04:17,129
- What's wrong, Mr King?
- Who's that man?

5
00:04:17,553 --> 00:04:21,466
- I don't know.
- Hickman. Morgan Hickman.

6
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:24,716
Better take his gun.
He's killed someone.

7
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,265
You won't need to take my gun.

8
00:04:28,646 --> 00:04:31,184
Won't need this any more either.

9
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:35,521
Luke Jameson, murder and robbery.
$500 reward.

10
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,858
- Oh. Bounty hunter.
- Yep.

11
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:41,699
Tracked down Jameson,
he tried to shoot it out.

12
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:45,491
Fair fight. You won't find
any bullet holes in his back.

13
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:52,165
You don't like outlaws brought in dead?

14
00:04:52,296 --> 00:04:55,248
Our officers of the law
bring in their prisoners alive.

15
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:58,292
Your officer of the law
didn't bring in Jameson at all.

16
00:04:58,844 --> 00:05:02,508
I'm not the law.
I work inside it for money.

17
00:05:03,265 --> 00:05:06,632
Same as you do
if you're in a legal business.

18
00:05:06,935 --> 00:05:10,053
I believe the banking business is legal.
I'm also mayor.

19
00:05:10,189 --> 00:05:12,061
My friends here are businessmen

20
00:05:12,191 --> 00:05:14,977
Except for Judge Thatcher
and Dr McCord.

21
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:18,197
You got a bone to pick
with the freight company, not with me.

22
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:20,941
They put a hunk of money
on Jameson's head.

23
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:24,074
He robbed a freight office,
killed the agent.

24
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:29,027
Wanted him dead or alive, which is kind
of a hint, sounds like to me.

25
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,833
We're not here to argue, Hickman.
This is a law and order town.

26
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:37,167
- Collect your money and get out.
- Suits me fine. How soon can I collect?

27
00:05:37,299 --> 00:05:40,132
Soon as I can manage it.
I've gotta mail in your claim,

28
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:43,129
And I can't
take your word it's Jameson, either.

29
00:05:43,263 --> 00:05:45,006
I wouldn't know him from Adam.

30
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,597
Well, there's one man in town

31
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,214
Who ought to recognise the corpse:
Bad Bogardus.

32
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:51,759
Jameson's his cousin, or was.

33
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:54,220
Get an affidavit from Bogardus.

34
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:58,939
I'll have to sign the claim, so will you.
When will it be ready?

35
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,651
First thing tomorrow morning.

36
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:06,492
You can unload my pack horse, Sheriff,
I gotta find me a place to stay.

37
00:06:40,987 --> 00:06:43,774
- I'd like a room.
- Haven't got a room.

38
00:06:45,283 --> 00:06:47,524
Maybe you can find me one.

39
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,408
I said I haven't got a room.

40
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:58,202
Any other hotel in town?

41
00:06:58,672 --> 00:06:59,916
Nope.

42
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:03,290
Where can I put up my horses?

43
00:07:03,844 --> 00:07:07,970
Livery barn's that way.
Can't miss it on your way out of town.

44
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:30,534
Now, don't be scared.
I'm not going to hull you.

45
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:33,994
I'm gonna take you home.
Got a real nice <i>coop.</i>

46
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,281
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

47
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,493
- What are you up to, son?
- Catching pigeons.

48
00:07:41,882 --> 00:07:44,289
Get out of that hayloft!

49
00:07:46,803 --> 00:07:50,254
Ain't I warned you to keep out of here?
Now, get out of here, and stay out.

50
00:07:50,391 --> 00:07:52,548
I don't want your kind around here.

51
00:07:56,187 --> 00:07:58,939
- What do you want?
- Put up my horses.

52
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:02,310
- You know who I am?
- I didn't ask.

53
00:08:03,112 --> 00:08:07,736
Bogardus is the name. Bad Bogardus.
Jameson was kin of mine.

54
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:14,577
Well, every family's got
one black sheep, some of them got two.

55
00:08:15,207 --> 00:08:17,910
Take your horses and get out.

56
00:08:18,585 --> 00:08:20,375
It's your barn.

57
00:08:39,731 --> 00:08:44,226
- Hey, mister, can I ride your horse?
- Big enough to get on, are you?

58
00:09:02,003 --> 00:09:04,130
Better get off, son.
It's gonna be a long walk back.

59
00:09:04,214 --> 00:09:06,288
- I live here.
- Where?

60
00:09:10,011 --> 00:09:11,889
- Kip, where have you been?
- The livery barn.

61
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,882
- You promised to keep out of there.
- I ain't afraid.

62
00:09:15,017 --> 00:09:18,716
Well, I am.
Thanks for fetching him home.

63
00:09:20,271 --> 00:09:22,482
Wouldn't know any place
a man could put up, would you?

64
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,397
You'd have to share a bedroom
with my son.

65
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:33,032
- I don't mind if he don't.
- I don't mind. Come on.

66
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,980
- More coffee?
- If you don't mind.

67
00:10:07,235 --> 00:10:09,476
Get up, Kip. You've finished.

68
00:10:13,616 --> 00:10:16,984
- You live here all alone?
- I have my son.

69
00:10:17,121 --> 00:10:20,156
Why don't you live here with us?
Then I can ride your horse.

70
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,534
Kip.

71
00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:23,077
The fact is,

72
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:25,249
I would like to stay a few days,
if your mother'd put up with me.

73
00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:27,832
She'd be glad. Wouldn't you, Mom?

74
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:30,746
If Mr Hickman wishes to stay,
he can stay.

75
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:32,211
Do you want to see my pigeons?

76
00:10:32,344 --> 00:10:34,502
Not tonight, Kip.
Now, don't bother Mr Hickman.

77
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:36,178
I just asked.

78
00:10:36,307 --> 00:10:38,131
Catched them in the livery barn.

79
00:10:38,267 --> 00:10:42,679
- You have enough pigeons.
- No, I haven't. But I'm raising them.

80
00:10:42,938 --> 00:10:46,056
Two's laid eggs already.
Wanna see my pigeons?

81
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:47,233
Kip, be quiet.

82
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:49,267
I better take a look at my horses
before I turn in.

83
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:51,192
I'll go with you!

84
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,862
I hope you don't mind.

85
00:10:55,241 --> 00:10:57,613
Bet he shows me his pigeons.

86
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:05,409
Wanna see my pigeons?

87
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,585
Lead the way, captain.

88
00:11:16,512 --> 00:11:19,465
- Can you see them?
- What are you gonna do with them?

89
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:20,641
When I raise enough,

90
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:25,101
I'm gonna sell them
and buy me a horse, maybe a dog, too.

91
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,096
- Take a long while, won't it?
- Yeah, but I'll do it.

92
00:11:31,861 --> 00:11:34,434
- Mom.
- You go to sleep now.

93
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:48,249
Nice boy you got.

94
00:11:48,754 --> 00:11:51,789
Well, I hope he doesn't pester you
with all his talking.

95
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,924
- I like kids.
- They like you.

96
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,097
I had a boy once.

97
00:12:10,024 --> 00:12:11,482
You lost him?

98
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:16,730
Him and my wife both.

99
00:12:17,865 --> 00:12:19,193
Same time.

100
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:28,077
I guess what got me remembering was
watching you make your own dress.

101
00:12:30,003 --> 00:12:34,711
I used to sit and watch her
the same way. It was nice.

102
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:39,504
This isn't mine. It's for a lady in town.

103
00:12:40,763 --> 00:12:44,808
- The way you make your living?
- When I can find the work.

104
00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:59,363
Well, I'm afraid that's all for tonight.
It's getting late.

105
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,941
- Say, am I keeping you up?
- Oh, no, no.

106
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,952
I'm going to sleep out here on the bunk.
You can go to bed anytime.

107
00:13:11,127 --> 00:13:14,080
I don't like to take your bedroom.
Why don't you let me bunk out here?

108
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:15,920
'Cause I'll be up before you.

109
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,464
You'll need a light
to find your way in the bedroom.

110
00:13:20,012 --> 00:13:23,877
- I'm sorry. I forgot your name.
- Nona Mayfield.

111
00:13:24,016 --> 00:13:25,295
Mayfield?

112
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:28,926
You heard my name mentioned in town?

113
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:34,351
No, but Mayfield.
I mean, your boy looks pad Mexican.

114
00:13:36,294 --> 00:13:38,379
Don't get me wrong.
I got nothing against Mexicans.

115
00:13:38,405 --> 00:13:42,449
Well, how about Indians?
Kip's father was an Indian.

116
00:13:45,703 --> 00:13:48,621
Very well,
you can move out in the morning.

117
00:14:25,368 --> 00:14:27,573
There's no use arguing, Ben.

118
00:14:27,955 --> 00:14:32,413
You told me when you took that badge
it was gonna be only temporary.

119
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:35,121
Look, Millie,
I guess I might as well tell you.

120
00:14:35,254 --> 00:14:37,577
What I'm hoping for...

121
00:14:37,715 --> 00:14:40,631
Well, if I can show them,
if I can make good...

122
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:43,427
You'll make good... In the graveyard.

123
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:47,133
Which you want, Ben?
Me or that badge?

124
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:51,012
- I can't quit until they want me to.
- I won't be around.

125
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,310
Oh! Well.

126
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,806
Morning, Millie. What's the trouble?

127
00:14:57,776 --> 00:15:01,902
She wants me to give up my badge,
Doc. How do you like that?

128
00:15:02,114 --> 00:15:04,567
Millie, that's your papa's badge.

129
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:06,828
I'd sure hate to see it on any man

130
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,277
That didn't keep it clean
and bright like he did.

131
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:14,453
As for Ben here, young as he is,
he's the only one we could find.

132
00:15:14,585 --> 00:15:16,872
Would you rather see it
pinned on a man like Bogardus?

133
00:15:17,004 --> 00:15:18,461
I don't care.

134
00:15:19,089 --> 00:15:23,299
I only know there's not gonna be
any tin star in my life, never.

135
00:15:24,303 --> 00:15:27,255
Where'd you be
if your mama'd said that?

136
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:31,305
I saw what Mother went through
never knowing what was gonna happen.

137
00:15:31,435 --> 00:15:33,806
Well, finally it did happen.

138
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:36,682
I'm going to be a wife, not a widow.

139
00:15:37,316 --> 00:15:40,149
I read something once,
sticks in my mind.

140
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:44,977
"From this nettle danger,
we plucked this flower, safety."

141
00:15:45,491 --> 00:15:47,481
Your father
plucked that flower for us, Millie.

142
00:15:47,618 --> 00:15:51,401
Folks felt safe
to raise their babies and not be afraid.

143
00:15:51,538 --> 00:15:55,155
But somebody had to walk
through the nettle patch.

144
00:15:55,417 --> 00:15:58,666
- Let someone else do it.
- So nobody does it.

145
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:01,748
That's how the wrong men
get hold of things.

146
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:06,081
Here's a man walks through
the nettle patch.

147
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,299
- Picks all the flowers for himself.
- I have no use for bounty hunters.

148
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,506
Well, that makes it unanimous.

149
00:16:12,643 --> 00:16:15,892
Miss Parker's father was sheriff here
for 20 years.

150
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:18,890
If you find it a little too chilly in here,
you can wait outside.

151
00:16:19,024 --> 00:16:21,146
I don't mind the chill. I'm after money.

152
00:16:21,276 --> 00:16:25,190
Oh, that reminds me.
Coroner's certificate.

153
00:16:25,572 --> 00:16:28,904
My formal affidavit
that Jameson died suddenly

154
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:31,322
But thoroughly of one gunshot.

155
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:34,366
I'm riding out to look at a bird's nest.

156
00:16:34,498 --> 00:16:36,987
Abe Picketfs already got 11 kids,
all girls.

157
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:39,912
Now his Annie's
as big as a barrel again.

158
00:16:40,045 --> 00:16:43,828
There's the kind of woman,
Millie, to build up this country.

159
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,588
Stay here, Millie,
and witness our signatures.

160
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,801
- My claim ready?
- Yeah. You can sign it.

161
00:16:59,564 --> 00:17:01,520
It's no good unless you sign it, too.

162
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,017
You don't have to tell me my job.
I gotta check it over first.

163
00:17:05,154 --> 00:17:08,438
I'll just wait, make
sure it's signed right.

164
00:17:25,048 --> 00:17:27,965
Come on, you sign my claim yet?
You sign it?

165
00:17:28,093 --> 00:17:30,879
- It's Bogardus. He'll kill you.
- Let go.

166
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:12,172
- What are you up to, Ben?
- Gonna arrest you, Bogardus.

167
00:18:12,304 --> 00:18:16,004
- You're not gonna arrest nobody.
- I gotta do what the law says.

168
00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:18,263
The law says
a man's got to defend hisself.

169
00:18:18,394 --> 00:18:20,266
You hear me?
That half-breed had it coming.

170
00:18:20,396 --> 00:18:22,885
Now, that's far enough! Hold it!

171
00:18:26,984 --> 00:18:29,357
Now, let's talk this thing over.

172
00:18:31,364 --> 00:18:34,732
- I gotta take your guns first.
- First you listen to me.

173
00:18:34,868 --> 00:18:37,701
I drawed in self-defence.
I got witnesses.

174
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,746
But even if I didn't,
no sheriff's gonna disarm no white man

175
00:18:40,874 --> 00:18:43,542
For shooting a mangy lnjun.

176
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:45,828
You an lnjun-lover?

177
00:18:48,214 --> 00:18:50,882
- I know what I got to do...
- Hold it!

178
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,678
Now, don't try that again.

179
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,432
Go inside, and I'll buy you a drink,

180
00:18:57,558 --> 00:19:00,759
And we'll talk this over
like two growed-up men.

181
00:19:04,981 --> 00:19:09,191
Hey, witnesses.
Sheriff's trying to shoot me.

182
00:19:09,611 --> 00:19:12,398
No I wasn't, I just want your guns,
that's all.

183
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,483
Nobody pulls a gun
without he means to kill.

184
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:19,159
Everyone in the street
can see what you're up to.

185
00:19:20,872 --> 00:19:23,908
Now, just take it easy,
and I'll go with you.

186
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:35,835
You made a mistake
pulling that gun on a man like me.

187
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,549
There was no reason
in the world to do it.

188
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,641
I don't like having no one
lay a gun on me.

189
00:19:43,187 --> 00:19:46,518
No, sir. Hadn't ought to done it, Ben.

190
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,892
Why, there ain't a man in town
would lay a finger on me if I was to...

191
00:20:00,995 --> 00:20:05,324
Excuse me for butting in, Sheriff,
but you forgot to sign my claim.

192
00:20:06,001 --> 00:20:07,744
- Lock him up.
- Give me that hat.

193
00:20:07,878 --> 00:20:09,204
Get going-

194
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,860
- Well, I ain't had a chance to thank you.
- Sign my claim.

195
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:37,483
If it hadn't been for you, I...

196
00:20:37,616 --> 00:20:40,568
Just looking out
for my reward money is all.

197
00:20:40,911 --> 00:20:42,155
Yeah.

198
00:20:42,955 --> 00:20:46,037
You know, I think if I'd seen him
pulling that gun from back of his hat,

199
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,956
I'd have triggered him. I think I would.

200
00:20:48,127 --> 00:20:51,826
- Ben, you almost got killed.
- Would've been a big mistake.

201
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:56,339
- What'd I do that was wrong?
- Everylhing. You let him stop you.

202
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:58,211
You let him talk, you listened
to what he was saying,

203
00:20:58,345 --> 00:20:59,672
Instead of watching what he was doing,

204
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:01,429
You pulled your gun
when you didn't have to.

205
00:21:01,557 --> 00:21:03,180
Oh, no. He'd have pulled his first.

206
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:06,510
Now, if you walk right up to a man,
chances are, he won't gunfight.

207
00:21:06,645 --> 00:21:11,803
'Cause at 3 feet, he knows he'll get hull,
maybe killed, even if he draws first.

208
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:16,563
Pulling your gun, you just goaded him
into trying to get you.

209
00:21:16,697 --> 00:21:19,898
Better take off that tin star
and stay alive.

210
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:24,651
- You hear that, Ben?
- Look, Millie. I ain't gonna quit.

211
00:21:30,793 --> 00:21:34,161
Woman's strongest argument,
bang the door.

212
00:21:35,882 --> 00:21:37,458
She's right, though.

213
00:21:37,593 --> 00:21:39,631
She knows what's wrong
with that badge.

214
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:42,512
A man pins it on, he can't take it off.

215
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,382
They'll give you a nice funeral.
See my claim gets off, will you?

216
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:52,434
I wouldn't expect no bounty hunter
to appreciate this badge.

217
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,318
I wore one a lot longer
than you ever will.

218
00:22:29,227 --> 00:22:31,432
- Afternoon, ma'am.
- Come in.

219
00:22:33,731 --> 00:22:36,815
- I'd like to see Mr Hickman.
- Come in, Owens.

220
00:22:44,492 --> 00:22:48,442
- I'd... I'd like to talk to you outside.
- What's on your mind?

221
00:22:49,622 --> 00:22:51,781
Well, I'd like to talk to you alone.

222
00:22:51,917 --> 00:22:55,367
Nothing you can say to me
she can't hear. What is it?

223
00:22:56,213 --> 00:22:59,295
I... I got a room for you.

224
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:01,799
<i>I got</i> a <i>room.</i>

225
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:09,598
Well,
I mean I got you a room at the hotel.

226
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,855
I went to Buck Henderson.
I laid down the law,

227
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,474
And he's giving you
the best place he's got.

228
00:23:14,606 --> 00:23:16,147
I like it here.

229
00:23:18,317 --> 00:23:20,440
Anything else on your mind?

230
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,607
Well, yes.

231
00:23:23,741 --> 00:23:27,570
Is it true what you told me,
that you used to be a sheriff like me?

232
00:23:27,703 --> 00:23:29,160
Not like you.

233
00:23:30,496 --> 00:23:33,663
- Well, how come you quit?
- That's my business.

234
00:23:35,501 --> 00:23:39,747
Look, will you come outside?
It's got nothing to do with her.

235
00:23:50,141 --> 00:23:52,097
What's wrong with Morg?

236
00:23:53,603 --> 00:23:54,848
Nothing.

237
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,193
- Well?
- Well, I'm in trouble.

238
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,700
- Bogardus out of jail?
- Cleared in court. Had witnesses.

239
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:15,242
Give him his guns back?

240
00:24:15,376 --> 00:24:19,668
Best Judge Thatcher could do
was fine him $50 for resisting arrest.

241
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:27,632
- How long you had that badge?
- Since Sheriff Parker got killed.

242
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:32,807
- Nobody else wanted it, huh?
- Yeah. Bogardus.

243
00:24:34,727 --> 00:24:37,051
He wanted it for a shooting license?

244
00:24:37,189 --> 00:24:38,813
That's how come he didn't get it.

245
00:24:38,941 --> 00:24:41,809
Town don't want prisoners
brought in dead.

246
00:24:42,902 --> 00:24:46,437
Yeah, I know.
They only want sheriffs brought in dead.

247
00:24:47,366 --> 00:24:51,065
- How come they pick you?
- I'm only temporary.

248
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:55,122
You're more temporary than you think.

249
00:24:55,582 --> 00:24:56,778
Yeah.

250
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:03,461
- Well, I guess I got a lot to learn.
- You won't have time to learn.

251
00:25:05,258 --> 00:25:07,297
I would if you'd show me.

252
00:25:09,387 --> 00:25:11,431
- Take off that badge and quit.
- I can't do that.

253
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:12,628
I'll be gone in a few days.

254
00:25:12,766 --> 00:25:16,015
Well, a few days
might mean the difference. It might.

255
00:25:32,827 --> 00:25:35,365
No, don't cock your gun
with the ball of your thumb.

256
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:37,571
It can slip in a gunfight.

257
00:25:38,417 --> 00:25:40,954
Hit the handle with the whole joint
of your thumb, like this,

258
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:44,418
And your gun comes out cocked
as you jerk it for action.

259
00:25:44,856 --> 00:25:46,649
Remember, there's a lot more
to gun fighting

260
00:25:46,675 --> 00:25:50,422
Than just shooting at a mark.
You gotta keep cool,

261
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:53,221
Have absolute confidence.
You lack confidence.

262
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:56,348
- That's how you let Bogardus stop you.
- Yeah.

263
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:59,263
And to have confidence,
you gotta keep a <i>cool</i> head.

264
00:25:59,396 --> 00:26:02,681
Don't take any chances
you don't have to, but wait,

265
00:26:02,816 --> 00:26:04,974
And end the fight with one shot.

266
00:26:05,109 --> 00:26:06,152
Wail?

267
00:26:06,278 --> 00:26:07,818
It's that time you wait, that split second

268
00:26:07,946 --> 00:26:10,614
That means the difference
between missing a man and killing him.

269
00:26:10,741 --> 00:26:14,238
- I don't want to kill nobody.
- Take your guns off.

270
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:17,165
The law says a man ain't to be shot
without his chance to surrender.

271
00:26:17,289 --> 00:26:18,995
Or make his fight.

272
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:22,245
As long as you're wearing that badge,
you gotta walk up,

273
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:25,994
Tell them to throw them up and then
watch which way his hands move.

274
00:26:26,131 --> 00:26:28,419
If they go up,
you got yourself a prisoner.

275
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:31,383
If they go down, he's dead, or you are.

276
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:34,595
A decent man doesn't wanna kill,
but if you're gonna shoot,

277
00:26:34,723 --> 00:26:36,429
You shoot to kill.

278
00:26:37,101 --> 00:26:39,472
How about hitting him in the arm?

279
00:26:40,645 --> 00:26:42,314
That hokey-pokey'll get you killed fast.

280
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:45,356
I hear a lot of guys bragging about
shooting a gun out of somebody's hand.

281
00:26:45,484 --> 00:26:49,777
They're lying. They shot to kill.
A wounded man can still kill you.

282
00:26:49,905 --> 00:26:50,982
- You did it.
- Huh?

283
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:53,438
With Bogardus, you hit his gun.

284
00:26:54,326 --> 00:26:58,192
That wasn't my fight. That was yours.
I could take a chance.

285
00:26:58,914 --> 00:27:00,324
What if you missed?

286
00:27:00,457 --> 00:27:03,575
He would have killed you,
or I'd have had to kill him.

287
00:27:03,711 --> 00:27:05,416
Now, try it again.

288
00:27:07,964 --> 00:27:09,920
The chunk's floated out.

289
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:13,175
- See that snag sticking up there?
- Yeah.

290
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:18,343
Draw fast, but don't snapshoot.
Take that extra split second.

291
00:27:21,352 --> 00:27:24,850
- If that was a man, you'd be dead.
- I got more shots.

292
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,059
You're dead.
You're not taking your time.

293
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:31,103
Well, I'd be dead if I slowed down.

294
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:32,946
I didn't say to slow down.

295
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:32,980
I didn't say to slow down.

296
00:27:33,089 --> 00:27:35,508
Be fast when you go into action,
be fast with your muscles.

297
00:27:35,534 --> 00:27:37,323
But deliberate here.

298
00:27:37,494 --> 00:27:39,496
Take that split second
and pull the trigger once.

299
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:41,778
That's what counts, that first shot.

300
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,705
Point it dead centre,
and the fight's over.

301
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:46,916
What, you didn't expect me to hit it,
did you?

302
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:48,871
Did you?

303
00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:53,256
Let's see you try.

304
00:27:56,262 --> 00:27:58,218
Well, it's kind of far.

305
00:28:06,397 --> 00:28:08,472
Just a matter of luck.

306
00:28:09,193 --> 00:28:10,733
Who's that?

307
00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:33,378
- Howdy, Sheriff.
- Howdy.

308
00:28:34,134 --> 00:28:35,211
What are you shooting at?

309
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:37,501
Nothing. Just a mark. Where you going?

310
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:40,471
Town.
Zeke and me's run out of groceries.

311
00:28:43,017 --> 00:28:44,724
The McGaffey brothers, Zeke and Ed.

312
00:28:44,853 --> 00:28:47,722
They got a run-down place
the other side of Red Canyon.

313
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:52,648
- Got some Indian blood, haven't they?
- You notice everything, don't you?

314
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:56,272
I notice
you're wearing your guns too low.

315
00:28:57,074 --> 00:29:01,023
- That's the way Sheriff Parker wore his.
- Parker's dead.

316
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,199
- How'd he get it?
- The stagecoach got held up.

317
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:09,538
He suspected somebody,
but he wasn't a man to talk.

318
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,076
Well, one day his horse
came in without him,

319
00:29:12,214 --> 00:29:16,874
And they found his body right here
with a rifle bullet through his head.

320
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:20,511
- Feel better?
- Yeah. Wanna see?

321
00:29:20,681 --> 00:29:21,960
Tomorrow.

322
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:26,760
More to your job than handling guns.
Things in town you gotta learn.

323
00:29:45,621 --> 00:29:49,405
- This your second shot of whisky?
- I can hold my liquor.

324
00:29:49,543 --> 00:29:53,669
Sure. It gives you more confidence.
Wrong kind of confidence.

325
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:56,630
Look, I'd get laughed at if I took beer.

326
00:29:57,551 --> 00:30:01,547
See anyone laughing at me?
Do as you please.

327
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,255
What else have I gotta learn?

328
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:08,476
Stop acting so mean
and surly all the time.

329
00:30:08,771 --> 00:30:13,265
I know why you do it, you figure
it makes you seem older and tougher.

330
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,680
Decent people gotta like a sheriff.

331
00:30:14,818 --> 00:30:17,391
Otherwise they'll be looking
the other way when he needs them.

332
00:30:17,529 --> 00:30:20,102
You think I'm cheating? How's this?

333
00:30:25,078 --> 00:30:26,572
- Sit down.
- Well, look, I gotta...

334
00:30:26,705 --> 00:30:28,080
Sit down!

335
00:30:35,672 --> 00:30:39,668
First thing you should have noticed
is they weren't wearing guns.

336
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:41,924
Learn what to stay out of.

337
00:30:42,262 --> 00:30:45,547
If you gotta step into a fight,
make sure you're the better man.

338
00:30:45,683 --> 00:30:49,263
Man, the old lady pulled out
a better fight than that one.

339
00:30:50,311 --> 00:30:53,098
You ever been up against a better man?

340
00:30:53,232 --> 00:30:55,851
If you live long enough,
which isn't likely,

341
00:30:55,985 --> 00:30:58,272
You might be the better man.

342
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,868
I only wanna be good enough
to keep this badge.

343
00:31:06,996 --> 00:31:08,820
Then study men.

344
00:31:08,956 --> 00:31:11,824
Paste this in your hat,
a gun's only a tool.

345
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:14,710
You can master a gun
if you got the knack.

346
00:31:14,837 --> 00:31:16,709
Harder to learn men.

347
00:31:26,014 --> 00:31:30,058
There's one you're gonna have to lick
before you're through.

348
00:31:36,315 --> 00:31:38,556
Well, let's call it a night.

349
00:31:40,445 --> 00:31:43,148
- See you in the morning.
- Afraid so.

350
00:31:45,158 --> 00:31:49,107
- Thanks, Morg.
- I'm not sure I'm doing you a favour.

351
00:32:02,508 --> 00:32:04,299
What's keeping Morg?

352
00:32:04,928 --> 00:32:08,545
You've been stalling me for an hour.
Go to bed now.

353
00:32:09,058 --> 00:32:12,638
Can't go to bed till Morg comes.
It ain't polite.

354
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:14,974
I don't think he'll mind.

355
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:21,642
Morg! Look, Morg. I'm a sheriff.

356
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:25,609
- Your shirttail's kind of hanging out.
- Don't I look like a sheriff?

357
00:32:25,741 --> 00:32:27,696
You look more like the sheriff
than the sheriff does.

358
00:32:27,826 --> 00:32:31,324
- Sheriff, bed. Come on.
- Can I ride your horse tomorrow?

359
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,569
Sure.

360
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:42,127
- I hope I haven't kept you up.
- No, no. I wanted to talk to you.

361
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,503
I was wrong about you last night.

362
00:32:46,428 --> 00:32:47,708
You sure?

363
00:32:48,222 --> 00:32:52,597
Well, maybe I was right last night,
but not today, not now either.

364
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:55,350
I shouldn't have gotten mad.

365
00:32:55,479 --> 00:32:58,479
I'm just so used to
everybody hating Indians.

366
00:32:59,565 --> 00:33:03,064
- We're raised that way.
- Well, I wasn't.

367
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,197
See, my father was an Indian agent
and he respected Indians.

368
00:33:07,324 --> 00:33:09,446
He liked them. So did I.

369
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:12,695
I grew up with some
who were really fine men.

370
00:33:15,373 --> 00:33:19,204
When you grow up hating them,
you don't get rid of it easy.

371
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,617
I know.

372
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:25,628
They say the only good Indian
is a dead Indian.

373
00:33:28,761 --> 00:33:34,218
When they find one with a man's pride
and courage to stand up as an equal,

374
00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:37,309
They kill him.

375
00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:41,471
And it isn't called murder.

376
00:33:42,567 --> 00:33:45,401
They've just made him a good Indian.

377
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:48,937
And it doesn't even end there.

378
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,028
Not when there's a boy to hate
and a woman to take it out on.

379
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:03,000
- It's Kip I'm thinking of.
- He's worth fighting for.

380
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,579
How come you've stayed on
in a town like this?

381
00:34:06,717 --> 00:34:09,503
Because of a friend. One friend.

382
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:12,672
Kip was sick when we got here,
and I didn't have a penny.

383
00:34:12,806 --> 00:34:14,549
The doctor saved him.

384
00:34:14,683 --> 00:34:17,090
Not only that, he found this place for us

385
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,467
And well,
he even got some of the ladies in town

386
00:34:19,605 --> 00:34:22,142
Who wouldn't speak to me
to let me do their sewing.

387
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:25,974
- That old fellow McCord?
- Dr Joe.

388
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,734
I don't care what any of them say.

389
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:34,863
The more they're against me,
the more I'll stand up for Kip.

390
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,195
Can you understand that?

391
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,202
It's the same with me,
only it's not a boy.

392
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:44,619
It's something inside me, pride, maybe.

393
00:34:45,631 --> 00:34:48,631
When they try to run me out,
I gotta stay.

394
00:34:48,884 --> 00:34:52,548
- How long will you stay?
- Till I'm paid what's owed me.

395
00:34:54,472 --> 00:34:58,089
Maybe it'll make things worse for you,
my staying here.

396
00:34:58,602 --> 00:35:01,091
You're welcome as long as you like.

397
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:16,194
Kip's a lucky boy.

398
00:35:53,614 --> 00:35:55,274
Any of you seen Ben Owens?

399
00:35:55,409 --> 00:35:58,776
There he is,
coming to town with Morg Hickman.

400
00:35:58,912 --> 00:36:00,488
Thought Ben Owens had more sense.

401
00:36:00,622 --> 00:36:02,292
He's been out with him
four days running.

402
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:05,617
Keep an eye on them.
I'll fetch the mayor.

403
00:36:05,753 --> 00:36:07,708
- Sheriff.
- Ben.

404
00:36:08,464 --> 00:36:10,538
I want to see you a minute.

405
00:36:15,845 --> 00:36:17,885
Wait for me in my office.

406
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:23,757
- What's the matter, Doc?
- Come on inside. I wanna talk to you.

407
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,072
- What happened?
- Keep that in your mouth, Millie.

408
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,147
- I told you, Dr Joe, I don't want...
- You keep that in your mouth.

409
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,907
- She's running a fever.
- I was merely walking by...

410
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,114
Who is the doctor here, you or me?

411
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:48,915
Now, you keep that in your mouth
so I can get a reading.

412
00:36:51,589 --> 00:36:55,087
- Know what day tomorrow is?
- Sure. It's your birthday.

413
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,127
Gonna be the biggest bang-up birthday
you ever had, too.

414
00:36:57,262 --> 00:36:58,589
The whole town's turning out.

415
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,097
You'll see all the kids
you ever delivered,

416
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:01,634
Including me and Millie.

417
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:05,851
Won't mean a thing
if I don't get my birthday present.

418
00:37:06,563 --> 00:37:07,973
What's that?

419
00:37:09,607 --> 00:37:13,473
- I want you two to get together.
- So, that's what you're up to.

420
00:37:13,612 --> 00:37:16,612
Now listen, Millie, you were
a sweet little thing when you were born.

421
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,565
Now, behave yourself.

422
00:37:18,909 --> 00:37:23,154
This big lummox of a sheriff here
was mean as all get out.

423
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:25,742
Bit my finger when I spanked him.

424
00:37:26,333 --> 00:37:27,790
But he's grown up to be all right.

425
00:37:27,918 --> 00:37:30,241
And I wanna see
you two McCord babies get married

426
00:37:30,379 --> 00:37:33,414
And raise more babies
like God intended.

427
00:37:35,258 --> 00:37:36,965
Why don't you marry him?

428
00:37:38,386 --> 00:37:39,927
You know why, and so does he.

429
00:37:40,055 --> 00:37:43,719
Why, he can't run away from
responsibility any more than you can.

430
00:37:48,521 --> 00:37:50,561
- Women.
- Well, she hates this badge, Doc.

431
00:37:50,691 --> 00:37:52,401
She wants me to take it off, and I won't!

432
00:37:52,526 --> 00:37:55,229
Well, you will,
if they take it away from you.

433
00:37:55,529 --> 00:37:59,359
Whole town's stirred up about
your hanging around with that Hickman.

434
00:37:59,491 --> 00:38:02,740
- Every day you're together. Nights, too.
- I know what I'm doing.

435
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:06,913
- He's a bounty hunter. You're a sheriff.
- He used to be a sheriff.

436
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:09,738
- Who said so?
- He did. He told me.

437
00:38:10,085 --> 00:38:11,709
You believe him?

438
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,541
Well, he wouldn't lie to me, Doc.

439
00:38:24,724 --> 00:38:30,227
Fifty years of my records.
History of the town's written down here.

440
00:38:32,732 --> 00:38:34,356
Here we are.

441
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,065
I won't read the year and the date.
You know it.

442
00:38:44,285 --> 00:38:48,828
"Heavy snowfall. Had to go horseback
to get to the Owens' place."

443
00:38:48,957 --> 00:38:53,202
"Delivered Elizabeth Owens of
a healthy eight-and-a-half pound boy."

444
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:57,212
Now,
I'm going to add a postscript as follows.

445
00:38:57,424 --> 00:39:00,507
Baby grew up to be a good sheriff
with one bad fault:

446
00:39:00,636 --> 00:39:03,208
He believes everything he's told.

447
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,505
You think he lied to me?

448
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:09,007
Well, let's just say I'm sceptical.

449
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:13,188
And Mayor King's no fool.
I want to see you keep that badge.

450
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:22,441
Thanks, Doc.

451
00:39:39,757 --> 00:39:42,876
- Morg, did you lie to me?
- What's that?

452
00:39:43,053 --> 00:39:45,092
You told me
you wore a badge like this one once.

453
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:47,676
- That's right.
- How come you took it off?

454
00:39:47,808 --> 00:39:49,681
None of your business.

455
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:53,347
I gotta know, Morg. How come you quit?

456
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:58,807
- I found out I was a fool.
- You think I'm a fool?

457
00:39:58,944 --> 00:40:01,433
Any man who wears that badge is.

458
00:40:02,197 --> 00:40:03,275
I know why you like it.

459
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:07,153
Everybody slaps you on the back,
tells you how important you are.

460
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:10,902
Decent people look up to you.
They're all your friends.

461
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,829
I've seen it before.

462
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,950
A sheriff I knew in Kansas years ago
had it bad like you.

463
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:21,289
Always took his prisoners alive,
proud of it.

464
00:40:22,508 --> 00:40:25,426
Finally, his wife had a baby, got sick.

465
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:31,588
Doctor said they'd die
if they didn't move to a drier climate.

466
00:40:32,643 --> 00:40:34,884
They had to have $1,000.

467
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,349
So he went to his friend at the bank,

468
00:40:39,485 --> 00:40:42,982
But seems like money
and friendship didn't mix.

469
00:40:43,113 --> 00:40:45,187
He said he was sorry,
but this was business.

470
00:40:45,324 --> 00:40:49,450
He had to have collateral.
Well, he didn't have collateral.

471
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:53,035
Already he owed money, doctors' bills,

472
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:55,784
But he had a lot of friends,
businessmen around town.

473
00:40:55,918 --> 00:40:58,407
He figured they'd put up the collateral.

474
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:00,538
Same story.

475
00:41:00,673 --> 00:41:04,123
And how'd he pay it back
if he quit and moved west?

476
00:41:06,427 --> 00:41:07,968
What did he do?

477
00:41:08,681 --> 00:41:14,053
Well, there was a man wanted,
big reward, dead or alive.

478
00:41:14,186 --> 00:41:16,011
So he went after him.

479
00:41:17,146 --> 00:41:18,806
Took a long time.

480
00:41:19,441 --> 00:41:23,105
Took him a long ways from home,
but he tracked him down.

481
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:26,190
Fellow tried to shoot it out,
so he killed him,

482
00:41:26,323 --> 00:41:30,272
Brought him in, collected the $1,000.

483
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:35,121
By that time,
his wife and baby had died.

484
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:44,462
Never had much use
for that tin star after that.

485
00:41:54,726 --> 00:41:56,551
Well, here they come.

486
00:42:00,162 --> 00:42:02,082
Hickman,
you're waiting to collect your reward?

487
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:03,151
That's right.

488
00:42:03,277 --> 00:42:04,390
We telegraphed the freight company.

489
00:42:04,528 --> 00:42:06,899
They telegraphed back,
authorised the bank to pay it.

490
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,072
Thanks.

491
00:42:08,574 --> 00:42:11,775
You'll have to sign for it.
Better look it over.

492
00:42:16,622 --> 00:42:20,537
Well, I guess I had collateral this time.

493
00:42:25,006 --> 00:42:26,582
I'd suggest you leave town.

494
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,254
You couldn't pay me
enough money to stay.

495
00:42:29,386 --> 00:42:32,386
Sheriff, I wanna see you.
We'll call a council meeting tomorrow.

496
00:42:32,514 --> 00:42:36,297
- Tomorrow's McCord Day.
- Oh, yes. Day after tomorrow.

497
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:45,690
I guess Doc was right.
They're gonna take my badge.

498
00:42:45,819 --> 00:42:47,276
You're lucky.

499
00:42:48,197 --> 00:42:52,192
Well, I don't care what they say,
I'm gonna give them a fight.

500
00:42:54,577 --> 00:42:56,320
Thanks for everything, Morg.

501
00:42:56,455 --> 00:42:58,944
You know, you kind of look like a sheriff.

502
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:01,655
Sorry I'm gonna miss
that council meeting.

503
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:02,871
<i>Me, too.</i>

504
00:43:15,848 --> 00:43:20,178
- Sheriff! Sheriff! Sheriff!
- What happened, Jim?

505
00:43:20,312 --> 00:43:23,513
Hold up! They shot Johnny Biggers.
Get the doctor.

506
00:43:23,649 --> 00:43:26,684
Johnny was riding shotgun.
We got him inside.

507
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:28,920
- They held up the stage.
- How is he?

508
00:43:28,946 --> 00:43:30,439
Hurt bad.

509
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:32,776
I'll go with him.

510
00:43:32,908 --> 00:43:35,943
Come on, folks, stand back.
Give him some air.

511
00:43:36,412 --> 00:43:37,952
Here's Doc Joe.

512
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:43,456
- Want us to get him out, Doc?
- No, not yet.

513
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:49,747
Well... Well, where'd it happen?

514
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:53,334
Other side of Abe Picketfs ranch.
Two men, had their faces covered.

515
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:56,968
Johnny shot one of them. The other one
shot Johnny as we were getting away.

516
00:43:57,099 --> 00:43:58,639
How is he, Doc?

517
00:44:00,727 --> 00:44:02,054
He's dead.

518
00:44:05,481 --> 00:44:07,853
Mighty brave man, Johnny Biggers.

519
00:44:10,028 --> 00:44:12,731
If I was sheriff, I'd get two for one.

520
00:44:17,785 --> 00:44:22,031
McCall. Sloan. Hardman.

521
00:44:23,374 --> 00:44:26,411
- Three is enough, Ben.
- I want one more.

522
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:28,578
You got one, Sheriff.

523
00:44:30,006 --> 00:44:31,120
Morg.

524
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,104
You lost your sidekick.
Next sheriff's posse, I'll be the boss.

525
00:44:48,191 --> 00:44:51,108
Ben, three of us is enough.
Four, counting you.

526
00:44:51,236 --> 00:44:54,319
All right, Jim. Show us that junction.
We'll get started.

527
00:44:54,448 --> 00:44:56,736
Here's the place to pick up their trail.

528
00:44:56,867 --> 00:44:58,407
One of them was hit
in the right shoulder.

529
00:44:58,535 --> 00:45:00,989
Dropped his gun when Johnny fired.

530
00:45:01,413 --> 00:45:02,693
Let's go.

531
00:45:10,004 --> 00:45:13,919
Hey, Morg. Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you.

532
00:45:14,176 --> 00:45:18,006
Oh, I... I had a little business in town.

533
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:19,382
What's that?

534
00:45:19,515 --> 00:45:22,182
That little paint horse? Name's Dinky.

535
00:45:22,309 --> 00:45:23,719
Is he yours?

536
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:27,010
- Yours.
- Mine?

537
00:45:28,106 --> 00:45:34,107
Dinky! Mom, look. I got me a horse.
Look, Ma, I got a real horse!

538
00:45:34,363 --> 00:45:36,236
Kip, you didn't say thanks.

539
00:45:36,365 --> 00:45:40,064
His name's Dinky. My own horse!
Ain't he a beauty, Mom?

540
00:45:40,202 --> 00:45:44,530
Wait, Kip! Wait!
Kip, you haven't said thanks.

541
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:49,999
- He didn't even thank you.
- He sure did. Didn't you see his face?

542
00:45:52,171 --> 00:45:55,504
- You're too generous.
- Don't fool yourself.

543
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:59,251
A man lives alone like me,
he gets kind of selfish.

544
00:45:59,388 --> 00:46:02,838
If he gives you anything, you can be
sure he's getting his money's worth.

545
00:46:02,975 --> 00:46:05,215
You wanna give me something,
how about a cup of that coffee?

546
00:46:05,352 --> 00:46:06,727
All right.

547
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:23,821
- Howdy, Doc.
- Howdy, Ben. No luck?

548
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:25,068
No, not yet.

549
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:27,873
One of them is hit, though.
We saw some blood a while back.

550
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,160
Was he wounded bad?

551
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:32,126
I don't know, Clark said he got a load
of buckshot in the right shoulder.

552
00:46:32,254 --> 00:46:35,123
- Where you going?
- Didn't you pass Abe Pickett?

553
00:46:35,257 --> 00:46:37,746
No, he passed us going hell for leather.

554
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:41,584
He rode into town the same way,
said his Annie's begun to holler.

555
00:46:41,722 --> 00:46:46,346
I know Annie. Fine dependable woman.
Helped her bring 11 girls.

556
00:46:46,477 --> 00:46:50,141
Always starts to holler three, four hours
before her time.

557
00:46:50,272 --> 00:46:55,015
That's the kind of wife to have for a man
who lives way out past nowhere.

558
00:46:55,152 --> 00:46:57,309
You be sure you get back
by tomorrow morning.

559
00:46:57,446 --> 00:47:00,695
No fear.
I'm not gonna miss my birthday party.

560
00:47:00,824 --> 00:47:03,444
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

561
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:18,209
Abe.

562
00:47:21,177 --> 00:47:22,255
Abe.

563
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,390
- I been asleep?
- About two hours.

564
00:47:30,937 --> 00:47:33,890
Baby. She's here?

565
00:47:35,024 --> 00:47:37,811
Well, I'll read you the record.

566
00:47:37,945 --> 00:47:43,317
"2:25 a.m. July 16th, my 75th birthday."

567
00:47:44,243 --> 00:47:48,369
"Delivered Annie Pickett
of a nine pound boy."

568
00:47:49,497 --> 00:47:50,824
Boy!

569
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:55,706
"Annie says she will name him
Joseph Jefferson McCord"

570
00:47:55,838 --> 00:47:58,790
"After yours truly, J.J. McCord, M.D."

571
00:47:58,924 --> 00:48:01,461
You sure it ain't just another girl?

572
00:48:01,593 --> 00:48:05,376
Well, I hope I'm not too old
to know the difference.

573
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:08,632
You better get in there
and see for yourself.

574
00:48:08,767 --> 00:48:09,963
Annie!

575
00:48:10,311 --> 00:48:11,471
Annie!

576
00:48:13,146 --> 00:48:14,307
Annie.

577
00:48:16,441 --> 00:48:18,017
Annie, honey.

578
00:48:18,569 --> 00:48:19,729
Annie.

579
00:48:45,219 --> 00:48:48,635
Well, Bessie,
you're kind of like Annie Pickett.

580
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:52,635
World of patience
with us doggone men.

581
00:48:54,479 --> 00:48:57,396
Well, now I'm gonna get some sleep.

582
00:48:57,941 --> 00:49:00,644
You know the way home
better than I do.

583
00:49:45,905 --> 00:49:46,983
Doc!

584
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:51,774
- Ed McGaffey.
- Oh, yeah.

585
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,865
- Can you come out to our place?
- Who's sick?

586
00:49:55,165 --> 00:49:56,789
My brother, Zeke.

587
00:49:57,418 --> 00:50:00,453
- I'm not sure I know the way.
- Just follow me.

588
00:50:23,526 --> 00:50:26,146
Get away, Spud! Go on!

589
00:50:30,616 --> 00:50:32,857
Come on, get out!

590
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:34,388
Well. You're hull bad.

591
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:42,510
Tell him how it happened, Ed.

592
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:45,306
We was hunting deer
back in the canyon.

593
00:51:45,442 --> 00:51:47,730
The buck jumped up,
and Zeke stepped in between

594
00:51:47,861 --> 00:51:50,979
Just as I was pulling the trigger.
Sorry, kid.

595
00:51:51,115 --> 00:51:53,105
It was my own fault, Ed.

596
00:51:58,121 --> 00:52:00,030
Hold that lamp closer.

597
00:52:04,377 --> 00:52:06,831
Now, this is gonna hurt, son.

598
00:52:17,849 --> 00:52:23,436
Well, old girl. You've had your sleep.
My turn now.

599
00:52:28,818 --> 00:52:30,608
Gonna be a fine day.

600
00:52:31,988 --> 00:52:36,282
McCord Day. How do you like that?
McCord Day.

601
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:46,242
Zeke gonna be all right?

602
00:52:46,378 --> 00:52:49,211
He should have been treated sooner.

603
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:10,604
Think he knowed?

604
00:53:10,736 --> 00:53:13,569
He knowed
the minute he laid eyes on you.

605
00:53:14,031 --> 00:53:17,695
No, Ed! Ed, you can't! No, Ed!

606
00:53:18,743 --> 00:53:20,734
Ed! Don't!

607
00:53:52,485 --> 00:53:56,102
Quiet, quiet, everybody!
Dr Joe's on his way in.

608
00:53:58,590 --> 00:54:00,968
Now, remember, folks,
Sergeant Plummer will blow his bugle

609
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:02,653
When it's time to start.

610
00:54:02,788 --> 00:54:05,277
The fiddler will lead the music.
Now, try and keep time.

611
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:07,988
Sing loud so's Dr Joe will hear you!

612
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:12,087
All right, get ready! Here he comes!

613
00:54:12,923 --> 00:54:15,412
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

614
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:18,040
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

615
00:54:18,178 --> 00:54:21,712
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

616
00:54:21,849 --> 00:54:24,599
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

617
00:54:24,727 --> 00:54:27,264
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

618
00:54:27,396 --> 00:54:29,803
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

619
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:32,477
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

620
00:54:32,609 --> 00:54:35,098
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

621
00:54:35,237 --> 00:54:39,020
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

622
00:54:39,158 --> 00:54:42,193
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

623
00:54:42,328 --> 00:54:45,078
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

624
00:54:45,205 --> 00:54:47,778
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

625
00:54:47,916 --> 00:54:51,497
<i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>

626
00:54:51,629 --> 00:54:54,379
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

627
00:54:54,506 --> 00:54:57,624
<i>Which nobody can deny...</i>

628
00:55:05,308 --> 00:55:07,431
- Dr Joe.
- Doc.

629
00:55:25,370 --> 00:55:27,694
- Where was he?
- Abe Picketfs.

630
00:55:29,207 --> 00:55:33,073
I guess you'll find it here.
He always wrote down all his calls.

631
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:35,118
You see it?

632
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:38,373
Something else here, too.
Here's what he wrote last.

633
00:55:38,509 --> 00:55:41,674
"Ed McGaffey stopped me in the dark.
Said his brother was sick."

634
00:55:41,804 --> 00:55:45,503
"Zeke sure was sick.
Gunshot wound, right shoulder."

635
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,298
"Took out load of buckshot."

636
00:55:49,394 --> 00:55:52,263
- Ed McGaffey.
- They killed Jim Biggers, too.

637
00:55:52,398 --> 00:55:55,765
- I wanna be on this posse.
- You'll get every man in town.

638
00:55:55,901 --> 00:55:57,015
Count me in.

639
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:59,523
All right, Sheriff,
better organise your posse.

640
00:56:05,076 --> 00:56:06,866
You better get home.

641
00:56:17,463 --> 00:56:20,879
We have unquestioned proof
of who killed Dr Joe.

642
00:56:21,218 --> 00:56:24,253
To make sure of the immediate capture
of Ed and Zeke McGaffey,

643
00:56:24,388 --> 00:56:28,965
The town council is putting up rewards.
$1,000 on the head of each man.

644
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:30,760
Dead or alive?

645
00:56:30,894 --> 00:56:34,012
- We want these men brought in.
- They ain't men. They're breeds.

646
00:56:34,148 --> 00:56:37,313
- That's got nothing to do with it.
- I say they ain't men.

647
00:56:37,443 --> 00:56:39,980
They'll fight
and fight dilly like all breeds.

648
00:56:40,446 --> 00:56:42,401
If rewards ain't for dead or alive,
Mr Mayor,

649
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:45,282
They'll be bringing some of us in dead.

650
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:50,859
All right, dead or alive.
Get your posse together.

651
00:57:04,677 --> 00:57:07,844
Sheriff! Hey, Sheriff! Let's get going!

652
00:57:10,808 --> 00:57:12,101
I'll give you a word of advice.

653
00:57:12,144 --> 00:57:15,594
That's a tough posse out there, and
they're mad, and there are too many.

654
00:57:15,731 --> 00:57:17,853
You show them who's boss,
or you're in for trouble.

655
00:57:17,983 --> 00:57:22,027
- Come on, then.
- I never hunt with a pack.

656
00:57:23,488 --> 00:57:24,815
All right, Morg.

657
00:57:24,948 --> 00:57:26,939
If you won't join me, don't fight me.
You keep out of it.

658
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,482
Your mayor sees it my way now.

659
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,694
There's a chunk of money
on each man's head.

660
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,237
Dead or alive, which means dead.

661
00:57:36,125 --> 00:57:37,627
Well, I'm gonna bring them in alive.

662
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:39,874
You'll never get near them
with that army outside.

663
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:41,545
They'll hear you coming for miles.

664
00:57:41,674 --> 00:57:43,083
Sheriff, let's get going!

665
00:57:43,217 --> 00:57:45,339
Takes one man alone to do this job.

666
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:48,718
What are we waiting for?
Come on, men! Let's go!

667
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:55,392
What are you gonna do?

668
00:57:55,562 --> 00:57:58,135
I'm gonna give you your last lesson.

669
01:00:02,271 --> 01:00:04,644
You think you ought to hunt them alone?

670
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:08,724
Lot safer than hunting with a pack.
Fellow could get trampled.

671
01:00:09,946 --> 01:00:11,736
- Where's Kip?
- Outside.

672
01:00:12,116 --> 01:00:13,409
He wasn't there when I came in.

673
01:00:13,450 --> 01:00:15,489
He must be. He wouldn't leave his pony.

674
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:17,907
The pony wasn't there, either.

675
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:20,825
Kip!

676
01:00:21,208 --> 01:00:22,369
Kip!

677
01:00:24,544 --> 01:00:25,622
Kip!

678
01:00:31,259 --> 01:00:32,456
Kip!

679
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:37,009
- Was he here when the posse come by?
- I'm sure he was.

680
01:00:37,141 --> 01:00:39,096
He's playing sheriff again.

681
01:00:42,145 --> 01:00:44,230
- He's followed them.
- Morg, there'll be shooting.

682
01:00:44,315 --> 01:00:45,890
He'll get hurt.

683
01:00:46,734 --> 01:00:48,274
I'll find him.

684
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:51,561
His horse is too small
to follow that posse. I'll catch him.

685
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:17,501
Get in there!

686
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:23,091
- They're not here!
- Not in the barn, either!

687
01:01:23,228 --> 01:01:25,267
Let's burn the place down!

688
01:02:13,027 --> 01:02:16,692
Come on! Let's get the McGaffeys!
Come on!

689
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:27,677
Hey, wait for me!

690
01:04:01,886 --> 01:04:03,083
Where's your posse?

691
01:04:03,222 --> 01:04:05,675
I left them, and don't call them mine.
They're all following Bogardus.

692
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:10,302
I told you. If the sheriff don't crack down
on the first man disobeys him,

693
01:04:10,437 --> 01:04:11,717
His posse turns into a mob.

694
01:04:11,855 --> 01:04:13,894
Well, that's what it is, a mob.

695
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:16,895
Thought you was a man
who took his time.

696
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,852
I'm looking for a boy.

697
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:21,816
Yeah, a couple of them,
name of McGaffey.

698
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:23,405
Name's Kip. You seen him?

699
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:26,201
No, I ain't seen him.
I'm warning you, Morg.

700
01:04:26,328 --> 01:04:27,868
I don't want them shot.

701
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:29,472
They're gonna get what the law says.

702
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,406
- The fair trial.
- You lunkhead,

703
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:34,032
I'll collect those rewards
when I get ready.

704
01:04:34,169 --> 01:04:36,965
Right now, I don't give three hoots
for the McGaffeys or you either.

705
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,914
I'm looking for a boy.

706
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:09,305
- Thought you was looking for a boy.
- I am.

707
01:06:09,348 --> 01:06:10,849
I'm tracking two horses, McGaffeys'.

708
01:06:10,975 --> 01:06:14,057
They're up this canyon. So is the boy.
I can handle this, and you can't.

709
01:06:14,186 --> 01:06:16,474
- You're gonna stay here.
- Am I?

710
01:06:41,796 --> 01:06:45,746
- Somebody's following the dog.
- I'll get him with the rifle.

711
01:07:25,715 --> 01:07:26,830
You all right?

712
01:07:26,967 --> 01:07:29,290
I was trying to catch me a dog
and was shot at.

713
01:07:29,428 --> 01:07:32,629
- Who shot?
- I don't know. Hiding up in the cave.

714
01:07:43,232 --> 01:07:47,016
You take my horse.
You come on the sheriff, you stay there.

715
01:09:16,492 --> 01:09:19,161
- Where's the boy?
- Holding the horses.

716
01:09:20,095 --> 01:09:21,973
- You stay here and cover me.
- No, you don't.

717
01:09:21,999 --> 01:09:23,989
You can't take 'em alive.

718
01:09:25,168 --> 01:09:27,628
- I can if you keep out of it.
- You'll get yourself killed.

719
01:09:27,671 --> 01:09:30,160
Well, then it will be your chance.

720
01:09:32,050 --> 01:09:34,837
I guess there's only one way
to teach you.

721
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,250
Go ahead.

722
01:09:39,807 --> 01:09:40,850
Ed!

723
01:09:43,978 --> 01:09:45,021
Ed!

724
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:49,304
This is Ben Owens. Can you hear me?

725
01:09:53,988 --> 01:09:55,944
Now, Ed, don't shoot.

726
01:10:01,746 --> 01:10:04,865
I swear both of you
are gonna get a fair trial.

727
01:10:05,876 --> 01:10:09,492
Now, just put down your guns
'cause I'm coming up there.

728
01:10:36,489 --> 01:10:37,864
He shot me.

729
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,191
You just got a new part in your hair,
that's all.

730
01:10:40,327 --> 01:10:42,531
Bullet bounced off that thick skull.

731
01:10:42,663 --> 01:10:44,322
Well, he shot me.

732
01:10:44,915 --> 01:10:46,372
You stay here and cover me.

733
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:47,614
Wait.

734
01:10:50,628 --> 01:10:52,418
Here. Take it, Morg.

735
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:57,339
You're the most pigheaded law mule
I ever run up against.

736
01:11:45,266 --> 01:11:47,258
My name's Hickman, boys.

737
01:11:52,106 --> 01:11:55,225
Lot of money on your heads.
I'll collect it either way you like.

738
01:11:55,444 --> 01:11:59,108
You ain't collecting nothing.
I got the sheriff. I'll get you, too.

739
01:11:59,365 --> 01:12:00,940
You didn't get the sheriff.

740
01:12:01,075 --> 01:12:03,528
He's covering me with his guns below.

741
01:12:03,661 --> 01:12:06,612
He's covering you in hell.
We seen him drop.

742
01:12:11,125 --> 01:12:13,877
Sheriff, throw a couple of shots!

743
01:12:15,421 --> 01:12:20,047
Not this way, you might hit a cave rat
or a bounty hunter.

744
01:12:28,184 --> 01:12:30,389
You're a bad shot, McGaffey,

745
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:33,638
Except when you sneak up
on an unarmed old man.

746
01:12:34,233 --> 01:12:36,390
Better throw out your guns.

747
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:24,296
Let them go through, Sheriff.
Kip will pick them up.

748
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:32,267
If you had as much sense
as your horses,

749
01:14:32,351 --> 01:14:35,018
You'd throw out your guns
and come out.

750
01:14:35,938 --> 01:14:38,605
I gotta get out of here! I gotta...

751
01:14:38,732 --> 01:14:40,356
Zeke, stay here!

752
01:14:41,068 --> 01:14:43,439
Stay. Stay now!

753
01:15:22,066 --> 01:15:24,141
Throw out your gun, Zeke.

754
01:15:50,636 --> 01:15:52,676
Well, you took 'em alive.

755
01:15:56,726 --> 01:15:57,923
Yeah.

756
01:16:01,773 --> 01:16:02,934
Go on.

757
01:16:35,264 --> 01:16:36,343
Kip!

758
01:16:36,475 --> 01:16:38,217
Oh, Kip!

759
01:16:38,644 --> 01:16:40,350
Kip, are you all right?

760
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:42,518
You're not hurt, are you?

761
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:47,892
Take them on into town.

762
01:17:00,373 --> 01:17:02,364
Will they let me keep him?

763
01:17:02,501 --> 01:17:04,456
Sure. He's your dog now.

764
01:17:04,795 --> 01:17:06,205
Gee, what a day!

765
01:17:06,338 --> 01:17:09,005
We catched two outlaws,
me and Morg did.

766
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:12,416
Did they confess they killed Dr Joe?

767
01:17:12,553 --> 01:17:13,963
The older one did.

768
01:17:14,096 --> 01:17:15,838
I hope they get hung.

769
01:17:15,973 --> 01:17:19,008
I kinda feel sorry for
the younger one, Zeke.

770
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:22,891
I got a hunch he'll get off.
Do some time, is all.

771
01:17:25,773 --> 01:17:28,097
You're not staying for the trial?

772
01:17:28,235 --> 01:17:30,558
I'll be moving on come morning.

773
01:17:31,738 --> 01:17:33,232
But you can't.

774
01:17:35,158 --> 01:17:37,114
What about the rewards?

775
01:17:37,828 --> 01:17:40,032
'They 90 to Kip.
- To Kip?

776
01:17:40,164 --> 01:17:41,953
Sure. He found them.

777
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:44,447
That's the hard pad. The rest is easy.

778
01:17:44,585 --> 01:17:47,252
You had the right idea, Kip.
One-man posse.

779
01:17:47,379 --> 01:17:51,079
But you can't do that.
The money's yours. You just can't.

780
01:17:51,190 --> 01:17:52,900
What are you gonna do
with all that money?

781
01:17:52,926 --> 01:17:55,713
- Give it to Mom.
- That's what I thought.

782
01:18:02,810 --> 01:18:05,016
Won't we never see you again?

783
01:18:07,982 --> 01:18:09,772
Can't I go with you?

784
01:18:11,027 --> 01:18:13,565
You gotta stay with your mother.

785
01:18:14,989 --> 01:18:17,657
She don't want to stay here no more.

786
01:18:43,226 --> 01:18:44,506
Bogardus.

787
01:18:45,603 --> 01:18:48,437
Looks like there might be
a little trouble in town tonight.

788
01:18:48,565 --> 01:18:50,972
Ben's got the McGaffeys locked up.

789
01:18:51,110 --> 01:18:53,349
Yeah. That's just the trouble.

790
01:19:26,853 --> 01:19:28,014
Ban!

791
01:19:28,147 --> 01:19:29,473
Hey, Ban!

792
01:19:29,773 --> 01:19:31,978
Hey, Bad, the sheriff's
got the McGaffeys.

793
01:19:32,109 --> 01:19:33,732
Got 'em in jail.

794
01:20:02,388 --> 01:20:04,712
Want something, Mr Bogardus?

795
01:20:15,902 --> 01:20:19,567
Gonna have a sociable tonight.
The whole town's invited.

796
01:20:32,085 --> 01:20:36,034
I promised the McGaffeys a fair trial,
and they're gonna get it.

797
01:20:36,173 --> 01:20:37,666
They sure are.

798
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:41,796
Got a big white man's jury here.
The verdict's already in.

799
01:20:46,099 --> 01:20:47,759
I figure Ed McGaffey's gonna get hung,

800
01:20:47,893 --> 01:20:50,928
But he's gonna get hung
the way the law says.

801
01:20:53,398 --> 01:20:55,556
If you men don't stand up
for law and order now,

802
01:20:55,693 --> 01:20:58,942
It don't mean nothing.
Now, who's coming with me?

803
01:21:19,173 --> 01:21:22,292
Step up to the bar, boys.
The drinks are on me.

804
01:21:29,809 --> 01:21:31,718
He didn't get no place with them.

805
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:33,347
He didn't try.

806
01:21:35,481 --> 01:21:37,604
Sheriff! What did they say?

807
01:21:38,527 --> 01:21:39,771
Sheriff!

808
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:46,691
How many volunteered?

809
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:48,280
Not one.

810
01:21:50,204 --> 01:21:52,445
As an officer of the court,
I have to keep out of it,

811
01:21:52,583 --> 01:21:54,657
But I suggest you all be
sworn in as deputies.

812
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:55,870
We can't do that.

813
01:21:56,003 --> 01:21:57,958
You're respected, level-headed men.

814
01:21:58,088 --> 01:22:02,417
Just your presence here backing up
the sheriff will avert violence.

815
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,629
What's going on?

816
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:09,301
They wanna get the McGaffeys
out of jail and string 'em up.

817
01:22:09,433 --> 01:22:11,009
You can hold them off?

818
01:22:11,143 --> 01:22:12,849
That's what I'm saying, Hickman.

819
01:22:12,978 --> 01:22:14,767
The sheriff can use you, too,
as a deputy.

820
01:22:14,897 --> 01:22:17,386
- Not me.
- We can't mix up in a thing like this.

821
01:22:17,524 --> 01:22:19,764
We can't stand up
against the whole town.

822
01:22:19,902 --> 01:22:22,439
That's the sheriff's job.

823
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:25,029
Why not get the prisoners out of town?

824
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:26,863
Yeah. Let's take 'em out the back way.

825
01:22:26,992 --> 01:22:30,489
They got a good jail in Dry Fork.
Hold them there for trial.

826
01:22:30,621 --> 01:22:33,621
You'll never get them a mile out of town.
It's murder.

827
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:35,248
Yes, it is.

828
01:22:36,417 --> 01:22:38,907
- Well, then we've done all we can.
- Yeah.

829
01:22:46,803 --> 01:22:50,088
Be sensible, Ben.
Get your prisoners out of town.

830
01:22:55,061 --> 01:22:58,263
Well, Ben, I guess I'll have to
turn tail and run, too.

831
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:00,473
I hope you understand why.

832
01:23:01,901 --> 01:23:03,182
Yes, sir, I do.

833
01:23:03,404 --> 01:23:04,778
You're a good sheriff.

834
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:07,857
I didn't think you'd make it
when you put on that badge.

835
01:23:07,992 --> 01:23:11,905
Know when to give up, Ben.
Don't get hurt. We need you.

836
01:24:01,919 --> 01:24:04,754
Were you ever through a thing like this?

837
01:24:04,923 --> 01:24:06,037
Yeah?

838
01:24:06,216 --> 01:24:09,252
Try and hold them. Get a shotgun.

839
01:24:09,553 --> 01:24:11,627
It talks louder to a crowd.

840
01:24:41,751 --> 01:24:43,411
What do I do now?

841
01:24:43,921 --> 01:24:45,034
Wait.

842
01:24:45,839 --> 01:24:49,883
They gotta get wound up first.
Takes time and plenty of liquor.

843
01:24:51,386 --> 01:24:53,461
A mob's only as tough as its leader.

844
01:24:53,597 --> 01:24:56,466
You've only got one man
to lick, Bogardus.

845
01:26:12,008 --> 01:26:14,083
How come they're so quiet?

846
01:26:16,846 --> 01:26:18,672
'Cause they're ready.

847
01:28:06,956 --> 01:28:09,874
Bring out your prisoners, Sheriff.
Jury's awaiting.

848
01:28:10,669 --> 01:28:13,206
My prisoners are gonna
be tried fair, Bogardus.

849
01:28:13,339 --> 01:28:16,374
Fair and fast, Sheriff.
The rope's all ready.

850
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:26,634
You gonna fetch 'em out,
or do we go get 'em?

851
01:28:26,769 --> 01:28:29,970
You're a brave man when you've got
a hundred better men to back you up.

852
01:28:30,105 --> 01:28:33,188
Why don't you come on
and get 'em by yourself?

853
01:28:33,317 --> 01:28:35,023
Come on, Bogardus!

854
01:28:40,031 --> 01:28:42,604
Well, come on, Bogardus,
you was a whole posse today!

855
01:28:42,743 --> 01:28:44,532
Didn't get no prisoners, though.

856
01:28:44,662 --> 01:28:47,150
Aren't you man enough to come on
and get them now?

857
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:49,280
Come on. What's keeping you?

858
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:51,455
Put down that gun, or I'll tear you apart!

859
01:28:51,585 --> 01:28:54,336
You fight with your mouth
and with your hat.

860
01:28:54,463 --> 01:28:58,412
Don't reach no further.
This thing might go off, both barrels.

861
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:36,951
Would you hold this, Sheriff?

862
01:29:37,548 --> 01:29:39,787
I'd like to talk to Bogardus.

863
01:30:15,335 --> 01:30:19,379
All right, I put down the shotgun,
Bogardus. Now tear me apaﬂ.

864
01:30:21,924 --> 01:30:25,127
What's the matter? You paralysed?
Tear me apaﬂ!

865
01:30:27,972 --> 01:30:30,676
What do you need? A little persuasion?

866
01:31:21,401 --> 01:31:22,681
Come on.

867
01:31:26,489 --> 01:31:30,236
Dinky. Dinky, we're going.
We're going, Dinky.

868
01:31:32,954 --> 01:31:36,239
Morg! You're not leaving now.

869
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,701
Yep.

870
01:31:37,835 --> 01:31:39,577
Well, what about the trial?

871
01:31:39,712 --> 01:31:43,126
It'll be a fair trial.
That's what you promised them, Sheriff.

872
01:31:43,257 --> 01:31:45,960
Well, how about Kip's reward money?

873
01:31:46,093 --> 01:31:48,546
I'll write you where to send it.

874
01:31:49,762 --> 01:31:51,506
Morg, don't go.

875
01:31:52,016 --> 01:31:54,932
Stay here and be sheriff.
Let me be your deputy till I learn.

876
01:31:55,060 --> 01:31:58,676
You got nothing more to learn.
Maybe I learnt from you.

877
01:31:59,315 --> 01:32:01,353
A man can't run away from his job.

878
01:32:01,483 --> 01:32:04,056
Neither can a woman. Dr Joe told me.

879
01:32:04,194 --> 01:32:05,604
Doc's right.

880
01:32:06,030 --> 01:32:09,314
I'll find me a town that needs a sheriff.
You got one here.

881
01:32:09,450 --> 01:32:11,654
You say yes, Millie, and stop worrying.

882
01:32:11,785 --> 01:32:14,073
I'll worry the rest of my life.

883
01:32:15,121 --> 01:32:16,366
So long.

884
01:32:16,582 --> 01:32:17,861
- Goodbye.
- So long.

885
01:32:21,544 --> 01:32:24,331
- So long, folks.
- Goodbye, Hickman.

886
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:27,542
So long, Hickman. Good luck.
