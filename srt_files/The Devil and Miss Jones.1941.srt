1
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,509
- Oh, George.
- Yes, sir?

2
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,508
Has he seen it?

3
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,200
Oh... Thank you.

4
00:04:46,002 --> 00:04:48,502
Morning, J.P.

5
00:04:48,503 --> 00:04:49,503
Morning.

6
00:04:55,604 --> 00:04:58,704
I thought I sold everything
below 38th Street three years ago.

7
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:02,605
Well, that store is right on 38th
Street, J.P., so we kept it.

8
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:07,906
Neeley Department Store.
N, N, N, N...

9
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:09,407
Natural Foundry, Napex Corporation

10
00:05:09,408 --> 00:05:11,908
National Radiator, yes,
Neeley Department Store.

11
00:05:12,309 --> 00:05:13,509
You still own it.

12
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,510
This dummy doesn't look like me.

13
00:05:17,511 --> 00:05:19,311
Maybe it's supposed
to be one of you.

14
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:21,612
There's a sign on the dummy
with your name on it.

15
00:05:21,741 --> 00:05:22,741
Where?

16
00:05:23,613 --> 00:05:27,913
M-E-R-R... That's
all you can see.

17
00:05:29,214 --> 00:05:30,514
What's been done about this?!

18
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:34,015
We had a talk with the manager of the
department store. He fired the ring leader

19
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,700
and half a dozen of the employees
who participated in it.

20
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,801
Have this picture enlarged.

21
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:41,802
And everybody, even
watching it, fired. Out!

22
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,592
That's an excellent
suggestion, J.P.

23
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,593
I pay you a great deal to take care
of my interests and my privacy.

24
00:05:46,594 --> 00:05:48,094
I want privacy.

25
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:51,395
I haven't had my photograph
in a newspaper in 20 years.

26
00:05:51,396 --> 00:05:53,296
This is temporary, J.P.

27
00:05:53,297 --> 00:05:57,100
Who could have gone to all the trouble of
finding out I own this piddly investment?

28
00:05:57,101 --> 00:06:00,501
Our detective will ferret the whole
thing out, J.P., in no time.

29
00:06:00,502 --> 00:06:01,702
What detective?

30
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:04,503
We have a man who's an expert.
If you care to speak with him...

31
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:08,004
He'll show you this is a simple little
disturbance that has no significance.

32
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:10,905
The Boston Tea Party was
a little disturbance.

33
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,006
I want to talk to this... detective.

34
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:15,600
Good day, gentlemen.

35
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:18,901
- Good day, J.P. - Goodbye.
- Good day, J.P. -  Good day, sir.

36
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:25,402
There's a detective here
for you to interview.

37
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,003
This way, sir.

38
00:06:29,304 --> 00:06:30,304
Thank you.

39
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:42,505
Sit down.

40
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:43,506
Thank you.

41
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:47,807
- What's your name?
- Thomas Higgins.

42
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:50,708
What progress have
you made, Higgins?

43
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:54,109
I, uh, I've gotten a
job in the store.

44
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:58,810
Nobody in the whole store knows I'm a
detective except the Personnel Head.

45
00:06:58,811 --> 00:07:00,971
Not even the General Manager.

46
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:08,675
I see.

47
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:11,376
I'm a salesman in the
Children's Shoe department.

48
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:14,100
That's the hotbed.
That whole fifth floor.

49
00:07:21,378 --> 00:07:23,878
Will you have the graham
crackers individually

50
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:26,347
or shall I crumble
them in the bowl?

51
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,279
- Individually.
- Yes, sir.

52
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,600
- No. Crumble them for a change.
- Yes, sir.

53
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:41,500
Tell me. How soon could you find out who
these employees are? The troublemakers?

54
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:43,500
Not more than two
or three weeks.

55
00:07:44,301 --> 00:07:46,100
Why not two or three days?

56
00:07:46,101 --> 00:07:49,601
Why, I've got to worm my way into
their confidence. Become one of them.

57
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:52,202
How do I know what they're going to
do in the next two or three weeks?

58
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm not gonna hang from
every lamppost in the city

59
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,151
while you worm your way
into their confidence.

60
00:07:56,901 --> 00:08:00,400
- It's a very difficult assignment.
- There's nothing difficult about it!

61
00:08:00,401 --> 00:08:02,401
Fire anyone that's
even suspicious.

62
00:08:02,402 --> 00:08:06,000
You don't have to be accurate.
Is there anybody you suspect yet?

63
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:09,901
Well, I... I haven't really started. I
thought I'd begin the day after tomorrow.

64
00:08:10,402 --> 00:08:14,602
- What's that?
- My wife's having a baby in Philadelphia.

65
00:08:14,603 --> 00:08:17,403
That's where I live. I thought
I'd go home tomorrow.

66
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:23,604
I don't think you ought to be separated
from your wife while you're having a baby.

67
00:08:23,605 --> 00:08:25,905
I'll get someone else
for this assignment.

68
00:08:25,906 --> 00:08:28,456
That's very considerate of
you, Mr. Merrick. My wife...

69
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:32,157
Nothing at all. I'll just keep this
card for the next fellow. Good day.

70
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,958
- Thank you for your kindness.
- Perfectly all right.

71
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:37,259
Go back to Poughkeepsie
and forget about it.

72
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,760
Poughkeepsie? Yes, sir.

73
00:08:40,761 --> 00:08:42,561
Good day, sir.

74
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:49,962
George?

75
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,263
Yes, sir?

76
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:52,564
Come here.

77
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:02,465
I want you to tell me
the truth, George.

78
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,766
Yes, sir.

79
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:09,467
What would you like to see changed
in the world? In a business way?

80
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,768
- Well...
- Yes?

81
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:16,769
I have a few shares of steel stock. I
would be happy if it went up a little.

82
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:20,970
If anyone asks you, George.
You're not a typical working man.

83
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,199
No, sir.

84
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:26,472
Dr. Schindler made up your pepsin
into sticks of chewing gum, sir.

85
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:28,573
He thought you would
like the change.

86
00:09:28,574 --> 00:09:31,804
You are to have one
every hour on the hour.

87
00:09:31,975 --> 00:09:37,100
You will find them in your lower left
breast pocket. It's time for one now.

88
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:41,500
Look at their faces.
Moron. Sheep.

89
00:09:41,602 --> 00:09:44,702
No wonder you can convince
them of anything.

90
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:49,003
How I'd like to hear one of
those troublemakers talking.

91
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:50,704
I'd show him.

92
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:58,205
- Mr. Merrick!
- Why not?

93
00:09:58,406 --> 00:10:00,206
I'd like to see them operate.

94
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:03,007
- Your stomach.
- I'll be one of them.

95
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:05,700
Mix with them. Let
them talk to me.

96
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:10,501
Why, these idiots. I'd play
with them like a cat and mouse.

97
00:10:10,502 --> 00:10:11,702
Oh my....

98
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:17,303
George, my name is...
Thomas Higgins.

99
00:10:34,904 --> 00:10:37,104
Young lady, could you direct
me to the Section Manager?

100
00:10:37,105 --> 00:10:40,200
He's right over there. See?
Standing at the little desk?

101
00:10:40,201 --> 00:10:41,301
Thank you.

102
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:51,002
- There you are, madam.
- Thank you very much.

103
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:52,003
Thank you.

104
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,904
And what can I do for you, sir?

105
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,705
Oh, uh. I'm working here.
I'm a new salesman.

106
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,100
- You're Higgins?
- Mh-hm.

107
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,001
"Yes, sir."

108
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:11,702
Yes, sir.

109
00:11:15,003 --> 00:11:16,603
Higgins...

110
00:11:18,204 --> 00:11:20,104
Harrison...

111
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:31,505
In the intelligence test you took
this morning your rating was 66.

112
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:35,400
That's one point over the
lowest passing grade.

113
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:37,201
66?

114
00:11:37,202 --> 00:11:40,100
There must be some mistake.
I answered all the questions.

115
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:42,501
You might have answered
some of them wrong.

116
00:11:42,502 --> 00:11:44,402
That's possible, isn't it?

117
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,103
I said that's possible, isn't it?

118
00:11:47,104 --> 00:11:48,700
Yes, it is.

119
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:49,701
Sir.

120
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:54,102
We never make mistakes, Higgins.
Neeley's is always right.

121
00:11:55,203 --> 00:11:58,503
This is the lowest intelligence
rating in my department.

122
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:01,204
I hope you have other qualities
to compensate for it.

123
00:12:01,205 --> 00:12:02,805
For your own sake.

124
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:06,206
Miss Jones?

125
00:12:08,207 --> 00:12:10,107
Don't lean against my desk.

126
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,000
And remove your hat.

127
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:14,901
Please.

128
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:20,000
Miss Jones, I'm assigning Higgins
to Slippers. Show him his duties.

129
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:22,800
Welcome to the shoe
department, Mr. Higgins.

130
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,301
You come right along with me.

131
00:12:30,302 --> 00:12:34,302
Now. This will be your counter, Mr. Higgins.
Bedroom, lounging, and house slippers.

132
00:12:35,603 --> 00:12:38,103
You know, this is
really the best job.

133
00:12:38,104 --> 00:12:39,900
No bending down for try-ons.

134
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:41,801
No running back and forth
for different models.

135
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,200
Everything's right here.

136
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:45,200
I wish I had this counter.

137
00:12:45,201 --> 00:12:47,601
He doesn't think that I'm good
enough to sell shoes, is that it?

138
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:50,402
Now don't be silly.
This is just the same.

139
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,603
It's even better.

140
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,200
You have to be cleverer selling
slippers than you do shoes.

141
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:58,100
Don't forget people can always do without
slippers. They have to be convinced.

142
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:01,100
How could he tell I'm not as
good a salesman as the next one?

143
00:13:01,101 --> 00:13:03,600
It's just your vanity that's hurt.

144
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:06,101
And you can sell shoes
when you relief for lunch.

145
00:13:06,102 --> 00:13:08,601
Show him then what a
good salesman you are.

146
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:12,302
Your lunch hour will be from 12:00 to 1:00.
That's in 30 minutes.

147
00:13:13,303 --> 00:13:14,903
I'm not going to eat lunch.

148
00:13:14,904 --> 00:13:17,804
- You're not?
- I'm going to stay here selling slippers.

149
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:21,600
- I'm going to make a good impression.
- Why aren't you going to have lunch?

150
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,401
I'm not hungry. I never
have lunch anyway.

151
00:13:28,602 --> 00:13:33,002
You go to lunch at 12:00 sharp.
No arguments.

152
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:41,603
You don't mind waiting
on me, do you?

153
00:13:41,604 --> 00:13:43,404
What can I do for you, madam?

154
00:13:51,206 --> 00:13:52,506
Mr. Higgins?

155
00:13:53,507 --> 00:13:55,300
It's time for lunch. I'll
take over the counter.

156
00:13:55,369 --> 00:13:56,536
I'm really not hungry.

157
00:13:56,601 --> 00:14:01,101
Why do you argue so much? You go to lunch!
And hurry up about it.

158
00:14:01,102 --> 00:14:03,602
- I don't know where to go.
- Well, you... um...

159
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:07,803
- Oh, Elizabeth?
- Yes?

160
00:14:07,804 --> 00:14:10,204
Miss Ellis, this is Mr. Higgins.

161
00:14:10,205 --> 00:14:11,805
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

162
00:14:11,806 --> 00:14:16,206
Elizabeth, will you show Mr. Higgins where
the employees' restaurant is, please?

163
00:14:16,207 --> 00:14:17,807
I'd be glad to.

164
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:19,300
Did you sell anything?

165
00:14:19,801 --> 00:14:22,871
One pair of men's
slippers, size 9, $1.98.

166
00:14:22,872 --> 00:14:24,992
That's fine! Did you have
any trouble selling them?

167
00:14:24,993 --> 00:14:27,200
- Oh no. No.
- Wonderful!

168
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,201
Be back in an hour, now.

169
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:47,600
- The restaurant's two flights up.
- Aren't you coming?

170
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:50,400
I always bring my own lunch and eat
in the park. It's pleasant in there.

171
00:14:50,401 --> 00:14:53,501
I don't intend to eat at all. Would it
inconvenience you if I sat with you?

172
00:14:53,502 --> 00:14:56,202
- Not at all. I'd love to have you.
- Thank you.

173
00:14:57,203 --> 00:15:00,403
- Kind of stuffy in here.
- Yes, isn't it?

174
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:09,304
- Sure you won't have something?
- No, no, thanks. I never eat lunch.

175
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:12,305
You men worry more about
your figures than women do.

176
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:17,206
It's not my figure I worry about.
It's uh... I'm just not hungry.

177
00:15:19,307 --> 00:15:21,807
Isn't it terrible about the store
not letting people organize?

178
00:15:21,808 --> 00:15:24,000
I made these myself.

179
00:15:25,201 --> 00:15:27,591
It's very rude of
you not to try one.

180
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:32,492
I wonder where they are
holding a meeting tonight?

181
00:15:32,493 --> 00:15:34,200
Go on, eat it.

182
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,801
- What is it?
- Tuna fish popover.

183
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:39,502
- Tuna fish popover?
- It's my own invention.

184
00:15:39,503 --> 00:15:40,800
Bite it.

185
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:43,501
- Oh, no, I couldn't. Really, I couldn't.
- Oh, please.

186
00:15:43,502 --> 00:15:45,402
If I ask you to?

187
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:47,603
You haven't got a graham
cracker, have you?

188
00:15:47,604 --> 00:15:51,304
Oh, a grown man eating graham crackers.
Why, there's no nourishment in that.

189
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:53,505
You eat that popover.

190
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:55,506
It won't bite you.

191
00:15:55,807 --> 00:15:57,007
Won't it, though?

192
00:15:58,608 --> 00:15:59,900
Tuna fish.

193
00:16:04,201 --> 00:16:05,301
Like it?

194
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:07,402
I don't know yet.

195
00:16:11,903 --> 00:16:14,800
- Is it good tuna fish?
- Costs 12 cents a tin.

196
00:16:14,801 --> 00:16:17,800
- 12 cents!
- It's almost as good as you can buy.

197
00:16:17,801 --> 00:16:20,201
- Almost?
- Go on, eat it.

198
00:16:25,702 --> 00:16:27,702
- Tastes good.
- Thank you.

199
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:30,503
- Here, have another.
- No, no, thank you just the same.

200
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:33,304
Oh, one isn't enough to feed an infant.
Go on, take it.

201
00:16:35,205 --> 00:16:38,005
How does a man exist without
a woman looking after him?

202
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:42,206
I could tell you were a single man.
You are single, aren't you?

203
00:16:42,907 --> 00:16:44,200
Yes, I am.

204
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:48,001
What did you do before this?
What kind of work?

205
00:16:48,002 --> 00:16:50,202
Oh, all kinds. You'd be surprised.

206
00:16:51,203 --> 00:16:53,463
Were you out of work long
before you got this job?

207
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,199
- Hmm. Yes.
- How long did you work at your last place?

208
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:01,300
- Fifteen years.
- And how long before that?

209
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:04,201
Ten years.

210
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:06,702
Isn't that awful.

211
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:10,303
Mr. Hooper's coming.

212
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:13,004
- Hello, Mr. Hooper.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Hooper.

213
00:17:14,305 --> 00:17:15,805
How do you do, Miss Ellis?

214
00:17:17,006 --> 00:17:19,106
He usually sits here
for a few minutes.

215
00:17:20,307 --> 00:17:22,200
Oh, I hope he's not angry.

216
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:24,001
Another popover!

217
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,202
You know, he ate
almost all my lunch.

218
00:17:52,203 --> 00:17:53,903
He was famished!

219
00:17:55,404 --> 00:17:58,104
Oh. I gave him 50 cents.

220
00:17:58,105 --> 00:18:01,199
He probably needed it so badly he
didn't want to spend it for lunch.

221
00:18:07,205 --> 00:18:08,505
Oh dear.

222
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,006
- Don't look up. A shopper is coming.
- What?

223
00:18:13,007 --> 00:18:15,807
A store shopper, they pretend they're
customers. But they're only testing you.

224
00:18:15,808 --> 00:18:17,708
Be careful how you act.

225
00:18:19,909 --> 00:18:22,609
Oh, uh, may I help you, madam?

226
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,200
Oh, that's all right, this
gentleman will wait on me.

227
00:18:25,201 --> 00:18:26,201
Yes, ma'am.

228
00:18:33,402 --> 00:18:34,902
What can I do for you, madam?

229
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:36,703
Do you sell slippers here?

230
00:18:37,704 --> 00:18:39,904
Yes, ma'am, we do.

231
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,305
These are slippers. That's
what we call them, slippers.

232
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,506
They don't look very good.

233
00:18:46,521 --> 00:18:49,821
Oh but they are. I wear
a pair of these myself.

234
00:18:49,907 --> 00:18:53,207
Woolies. Keep your
feet nice and warm.

235
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:57,100
- Real sheep wool.
- Aren't they a little too warm for summer?

236
00:18:57,101 --> 00:19:00,001
We never had any complaint
from the sheep. Ha-ha.

237
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,302
I'll think about it.

238
00:19:04,553 --> 00:19:08,586
I hope you didn't mind my inconveniencing
you without buying anything.

239
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:11,303
Of course not, madam.
I'm only here to serve you.

240
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:20,304
- Are you chewing gum?
- No, ma'am.

241
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:22,705
I'm a store shopper.
Open your mouth.

242
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,906
- Did you swallow that gum?
- No, ma'am, I wasn't chewing any gum.

243
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:36,107
Well, see that you
don't in the future.

244
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,208
And don't lean on the counter.

245
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:39,709
Yes, ma'am.

246
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,901
Well, you didn't do so badly.

247
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:01,202
Say, what are you doing?
Keep a diary?

248
00:20:01,203 --> 00:20:04,503
It's a kind of a diary.
A Doomsday Book.

249
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,984
What's a Doomsday Book?

250
00:20:05,985 --> 00:20:10,385
It contains the names of a lot of people
who are going to meet their doom.

251
00:20:10,886 --> 00:20:12,086
I don't get it.

252
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:16,087
Employees! Listen, employees!
Here I am! Right here!

253
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:21,388
Gather round, please! All the employees
of the Neeley's Department Store.

254
00:20:21,389 --> 00:20:22,989
I have a message for you!

255
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,790
They have fired some
of us for organizing!

256
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,391
But we haven't given up!
We are still at it!

257
00:20:28,392 --> 00:20:30,692
Call the detectives!
Call the detectives!

258
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,600
Don't be afraid!
Come to our meeting!

259
00:20:32,601 --> 00:20:35,100
If enough of us stick together,
they won't be able to stop it!

260
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:37,701
Nobody listen to him!
Everybody stop him!

261
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:40,302
I repeat, come to our meeting!

262
00:20:40,303 --> 00:20:41,603
Get him out!

263
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:44,304
Get him out of here. This is one time
you can't throw me out, gentlemen.

264
00:20:44,305 --> 00:20:46,505
- And I haven't any key.
- Take him away!

265
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,806
Saw me out!
It will only take about four hours.

266
00:20:48,807 --> 00:20:51,207
And while you're sawing,
I'll give a little speech.

267
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,408
Don't be afraid! Come to our meeting!

268
00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:56,000
In union there is strength!
We gotta fight together.

269
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:58,201
We gotta think... Hey!

270
00:20:58,202 --> 00:21:01,502
Right is on our side!
And don't be afraid!

271
00:21:01,603 --> 00:21:03,503
We got the situation
well in hand!

272
00:21:03,504 --> 00:21:06,404
They can't stop us now!
I tell you they can't stop us...

273
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:10,605
Fellow employees.
And I call you fellow employees

274
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:12,506
because that is what we all are

275
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:15,507
from the smallest stock clerk to me myself

276
00:21:15,705 --> 00:21:18,138
though I carry the title
of General Manager.

277
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,508
There was a disturbance
on the 5th floor today.

278
00:21:21,509 --> 00:21:25,009
A shocking un-American
invasion of private property.

279
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:28,400
Nothing more or less than trespassing.
A criminal offense.

280
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:31,411
There are still some troublemakers
employed in this store

281
00:21:31,412 --> 00:21:34,202
we have not as yet ferreted out.
But we shall.

282
00:21:34,203 --> 00:21:37,403
And if employees are found
cooperating with these traitors

283
00:21:37,404 --> 00:21:40,004
in our one big happy family

284
00:21:40,005 --> 00:21:43,205
I can tell you now, they
will be not only discharged

285
00:21:43,206 --> 00:21:47,706
but blackballed from working in any
department store in this city.

286
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,407
Now, may I wish you all
a very good evening.

287
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:54,708
Good night, fellow employees.

288
00:21:56,509 --> 00:21:59,500
- Are you doing anything tonight?
- Eh? No. Not especially.

289
00:21:59,501 --> 00:22:00,801
Come with me.

290
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:04,002
Good night.

291
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,403
Good night.

292
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,404
- What've you got in there?
- Me, you idiot?

293
00:22:11,405 --> 00:22:13,605
Don't get excited, Pop,
thought it was a package.

294
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,006
Come on, come on.

295
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:17,307
Good night.

296
00:22:18,708 --> 00:22:19,808
Good night.

297
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,407
- Does it hurt much?
- A little.

298
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,800
I can't understand how you've
never eaten in an Automat before.

299
00:22:25,801 --> 00:22:27,191
I never thought of it.

300
00:22:27,192 --> 00:22:30,092
I could sue them getting my
finger caught like that.

301
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:32,002
Well, I don't know. I've
been eating there for years.

302
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:35,049
I never heard of anybody getting
their fingers caught before.

303
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:39,200
Say, tell me the truth.
Was the manager right?

304
00:22:39,201 --> 00:22:41,801
Did you try to get that blueberry
pie without putting in a nickel?

305
00:22:42,002 --> 00:22:43,302
You, too?

306
00:22:43,303 --> 00:22:45,503
I tell you, I did put in a nickel.

307
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,504
But I went to get coffee and somebody
must have sneaked the pie out.

308
00:22:51,205 --> 00:22:53,805
It was their responsibility to
get me another piece of pie.

309
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:56,006
And I'd have gotten it too
if you hadn't interfered.

310
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,007
Honey!

311
00:22:57,402 --> 00:22:59,435
Joe, did they do anything
to you? Did they hurt you?

312
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,208
Never laid a hand on me.
I dared 'em to.

313
00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:03,209
I was so afraid that they'd
do something to you.

314
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,810
- Well, uh, who's this?
- He started in the store this morning.

315
00:23:05,811 --> 00:23:08,911
- Oh, welcome, brother!
- Mr. Higgins, this is Joe O'Brien.

316
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:11,512
He hung up the dummy of
John P. Merrick.

317
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:13,600
Made the front page of
the Times, that's all.

318
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:17,501
- Did you see it?
- Yes, I saw it. This is quite a pleasure.

319
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:20,200
Likewise. Come on.
We're just about ready to start.

320
00:23:21,201 --> 00:23:22,401
Come on.

321
00:23:36,302 --> 00:23:39,402
I knew you'd join us. I could
tell that the minute I saw you.

322
00:23:39,403 --> 00:23:41,103
All right, everybody.

323
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:44,904
I, uh, see that some of you
are here for the first time

324
00:23:44,905 --> 00:23:47,905
and you'd probably like
to know more about us.

325
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,200
We are not professional agitators.

326
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:56,001
I myself started six years
ago at the Neeley store

327
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:58,199
as a packing boy

328
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:01,100
and worked up to Assistant
Section Manager.

329
00:24:01,101 --> 00:24:04,100
Now, our quarrel is simple.

330
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,199
We're given a small raise every year.

331
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,700
Thanks.

332
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:14,201
At the end of 10 or 15 years, when our
salary is higher than a new employ's

333
00:24:14,602 --> 00:24:15,802
we're let out.

334
00:24:15,803 --> 00:24:18,203
Now, this is a regular practice
at the store, mind you.

335
00:24:18,904 --> 00:24:20,600
It's probably good bookkeeping, but

336
00:24:21,301 --> 00:24:22,901
I think that it's pretty unfair.

337
00:24:23,902 --> 00:24:26,202
We're entitled to some
security in exchange

338
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:29,803
for a quarter of a lifetime
of loyalty to one employer.

339
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,004
Uhm, may I interrupt, please?

340
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:38,805
I've attended many of these meetings
but I've never spoken before.

341
00:24:39,506 --> 00:24:44,006
I'd like to show you a practical case
of what we're fighting for, if I may.

342
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:45,507
Certainly, Mary.

343
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:46,808
Step up here.

344
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:49,109
This is Miss Jones of Children's Shoes.

345
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,510
Mr. Higgins, would you
step up here, please?

346
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,511
Mr. Higgins!

347
00:24:57,812 --> 00:24:58,812
Mr. Higgins!

348
00:25:00,713 --> 00:25:02,413
Step up here, will you, please?

349
00:25:06,914 --> 00:25:08,914
This is Thomas Higgins.

350
00:25:09,815 --> 00:25:11,815
How old are you, Mr. Higgins?

351
00:25:14,116 --> 00:25:15,516
Fifty-five.

352
00:25:16,717 --> 00:25:18,817
Now, don't be nervous, Tom.

353
00:25:18,818 --> 00:25:23,418
He's 55. Now, that's
not so very old.

354
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:28,319
Look at him, he's bright,
alert, has all his faculties.

355
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:33,420
Can you honestly expect to be
in better condition at his age?

356
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:35,901
I hardly think so.

357
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:40,202
This then is the picture
of you... and me

358
00:25:40,203 --> 00:25:42,303
at 55 years of age.

359
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,204
Now, I'm gonna tell you
the rest of that picture.

360
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:50,905
He came to work this morning
in Children's Shoes

361
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:55,506
without the few cents in his
pocket he needed to buy lunch.

362
00:25:56,807 --> 00:25:58,207
And that isn't all.

363
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,208
I gave him 50 cents. You
know what he did with it?

364
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:05,709
He kept it because he
needed even that 50 cents

365
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,600
more than he needed food.

366
00:26:07,601 --> 00:26:09,701
Maybe for medicine.

367
00:26:09,702 --> 00:26:13,302
Maybe for a place to sleep tonight,
I don't know. I didn't ask him.

368
00:26:13,303 --> 00:26:15,203
I felt too ashamed for him.

369
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:19,204
Do you want to know
how he got his lunch?

370
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:22,705
From another employee.

371
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:27,199
Sharing the few crusts she brought
which were hardly enough for herself.

372
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,700
Fifty-five years old

373
00:26:34,601 --> 00:26:36,301
and nothing to eat.

374
00:26:38,502 --> 00:26:41,502
By what kind fate he got a
job today I'll never know.

375
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:44,503
And how long will
the store keep him?

376
00:26:44,504 --> 00:26:47,754
And what will become of him
when they let him out?

377
00:26:47,755 --> 00:26:49,905
And he will be let out,
he has been before.

378
00:26:49,906 --> 00:26:54,906
He worked 15 years. 15 long loyal
years, and they let him go.

379
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,707
Before that, he had
a job for 10 years.

380
00:26:57,708 --> 00:27:01,908
Twenty-five years for
only two employers.

381
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,009
Surely this man must have
been capable of holding a job.

382
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,910
And yet, now.

383
00:27:09,511 --> 00:27:10,911
White-haired

384
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:14,512
friendless, he faces
another employer.

385
00:27:15,913 --> 00:27:17,513
Who will use him.

386
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:20,500
And when he's through with
him, he'll throw him aside

387
00:27:20,614 --> 00:27:22,214
for a younger man.

388
00:27:24,115 --> 00:27:29,615
Leaving him insecure,
friendless, homeless

389
00:27:32,216 --> 00:27:36,416
with no-one to turn to except
charity and the poorhouse.

390
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:41,317
Please, take your seat.

391
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:53,718
- You were wonderful.
- I didn't do anything.

392
00:27:54,719 --> 00:27:56,219
All right, everybody.

393
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,420
If you don't think that we're right
now, nothing will ever convince you.

394
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,201
Are you with us or aren't you?

395
00:28:04,202 --> 00:28:06,202
- We sure are, Joe.
- We're with you, Joe.

396
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:11,900
What do you think their complaint is?

397
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:14,304
They are getting too much money.

398
00:28:15,405 --> 00:28:17,105
That's what it is, actually.

399
00:28:17,106 --> 00:28:19,806
I knew they were crackpots.

400
00:28:20,307 --> 00:28:24,107
Why don't they make themselves so
indispensable the store can't fire them?

401
00:28:24,108 --> 00:28:26,708
Oh, no. That's too hard. Heh.

402
00:28:26,709 --> 00:28:29,209
I'm glad I saw this.

403
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:32,600
I found out who some of them are.
The first day, too.

404
00:28:32,601 --> 00:28:36,811
Not all of them. But just give
me another couple of days.

405
00:28:36,812 --> 00:28:39,812
Heh. The idiots.
Making me one of them.

406
00:28:39,813 --> 00:28:42,813
I'll show them who hangs who.

407
00:28:42,814 --> 00:28:44,614
Shall I crumble them, sir?

408
00:28:44,615 --> 00:28:47,415
Graham crackers, take it away.

409
00:28:48,216 --> 00:28:50,016
And let me tell you another thing.

410
00:28:50,017 --> 00:28:53,100
If I'm not sick by tonight or
tomorrow at the latest

411
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:57,901
my fancy Dr. Schindler from Vienna
will wish he was back in Vienna.

412
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,102
Yes, sir.

413
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:02,303
And I want a lunch prepared for
me tomorrow to take along.

414
00:29:02,304 --> 00:29:03,904
In a shoe box.

415
00:29:05,105 --> 00:29:06,200
Yes, sir.

416
00:29:06,201 --> 00:29:08,500
I want tuna fish popovers.

417
00:29:08,501 --> 00:29:10,301
Tuna fish popovers?!

418
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,802
- Tuna fish popovers?
- You heard me.

419
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:18,603
I wonder... I wonder if the chef
can make tuna fish popovers?

420
00:29:18,604 --> 00:29:20,204
Then get one who does.

421
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:23,705
If certain people can make
them on a little gas stove

422
00:29:23,706 --> 00:29:27,806
then that idiot downstairs ought to be
able to make them in that whole restaurant.

423
00:29:28,307 --> 00:29:29,507
Yes, sir.

424
00:29:29,508 --> 00:29:32,908
I didn't do so well selling
things today.

425
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:35,609
- It's just a matter of luck.
- Yes, sir.

426
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,410
What I want you to do

427
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:40,411
is to get a little girl

428
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:45,200
and bring her to the shoe department
tomorrow at exactly ten after twelve.

429
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,801
Is there anything
I can do for you, sir?

430
00:30:09,802 --> 00:30:13,262
I thought... I thought I would buy
some shoes for my little girl.

431
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:15,463
Shoes for the little girl. Yes, sir.
Certainly, sir.

432
00:30:15,464 --> 00:30:18,564
- Won't you be seated?
- Yes, sir. I mean certainly.

433
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,099
He'll bungle it.

434
00:30:25,565 --> 00:30:28,432
No, he's pretty good, Mr. Hooper.
I've been watching him.

435
00:30:31,466 --> 00:30:34,296
I want you to buy a
dozen pair of shoes.

436
00:30:34,297 --> 00:30:38,397
Eleven? I think that's too many.
They'll get suspicious.

437
00:30:38,398 --> 00:30:40,198
- You think so?
- Yes, sir.

438
00:30:40,199 --> 00:30:42,599
All right, then a half dozen.

439
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,200
No less.

440
00:30:44,201 --> 00:30:46,301
No, sir, half a dozen.

441
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:50,002
One and a half.

442
00:30:52,203 --> 00:30:53,203
Thank you.

443
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,200
This is your chance.
Now, don't be nervous.

444
00:30:58,201 --> 00:30:59,601
I'm not nervous. Stop
talking about it.

445
00:30:59,602 --> 00:31:01,255
- What size do you want?
- One and a half.

446
00:31:02,056 --> 00:31:04,556
- Here. Now ,don't be nervous.
- For heaven's sake.

447
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:07,357
Is this the hardest
shoe to sell?

448
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:10,258
What's the hardest shoe to
get rid of in the whole stock?

449
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:11,859
- The hardest?
- Yes.

450
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:14,660
Well, we have some high-tops that
haven't moved for years.

451
00:31:14,661 --> 00:31:18,761
- 25 cents bonus for each pair you sell.
- Fine. These are the ones I want.

452
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:20,262
Don't you think you'd
better start on these?

453
00:31:20,292 --> 00:31:21,325
How many of those
you got in stock?

454
00:31:21,363 --> 00:31:23,963
- Five.
- That's too bad. I could've sold six.

455
00:31:23,964 --> 00:31:27,700
I wish you'd just try to sell the ordinary
shoes. You're making trouble for yourself.

456
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,965
Now. Here we are.

457
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:35,266
- Just slip your foot in.
- I don't like that.

458
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:39,367
- Come, come, now.
- Put your foot in the shoe, Sally.

459
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:40,800
I don't want to,
I don't like it.

460
00:31:40,801 --> 00:31:42,301
- Put your foot in.
- I don't like it!

461
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:44,802
Where'd you get this brat?

462
00:31:44,803 --> 00:31:46,400
She belongs to the upstairs maid.

463
00:31:46,472 --> 00:31:48,939
If she don't stop squirming, there's
going to be another upstairs maid.

464
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:51,801
- Stop squirming, dear.
- I don't like it! I don't like it!

465
00:31:51,802 --> 00:31:52,802
Na, na, na!

466
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:55,199
I knew he didn't have the
personality for shoes.

467
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,300
- Stop squirming, dear.
- I don't like it! I don't like it!

468
00:31:58,301 --> 00:31:59,601
Na, na, na, na, na...

469
00:32:01,602 --> 00:32:03,902
- I don't like it!
- Grab hold of her, grab hold of her.

470
00:32:07,403 --> 00:32:09,503
Well, well, well.
How are we coming along?

471
00:32:09,904 --> 00:32:11,104
Fine!

472
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:16,705
Mr. Higgins. We're not
shoeing a horse, you know?

473
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:25,606
Look. Look what I've
got for the little lady.

474
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:31,507
You're quite sure that
you want this type of shoe?

475
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,308
Yes, sir. This is the
type that I want.

476
00:32:35,709 --> 00:32:37,929
Hmm. All five pairs.

477
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:41,330
I've been looking for this model.
They are very hard to find.

478
00:32:48,431 --> 00:32:52,031
There's someone at your slipper counter.
I'll take care of this customer.

479
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:53,832
I've got these shoes sold.

480
00:32:54,433 --> 00:32:57,033
There's someone at
your slipper counter.

481
00:33:02,434 --> 00:33:04,334
He's not a regular
shoe salesman.

482
00:33:04,335 --> 00:33:07,335
I'm the Section Manager but
I'm going to wait on you myself.

483
00:33:07,336 --> 00:33:08,936
Thank you.

484
00:33:08,937 --> 00:33:12,337
There's someone at
your slipper counter.

485
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:25,538
Will you take them with you,
sir, or shall I send them?

486
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,640
- Are you taking these shoes, sir?
- Yes, sir. Wrap them up, please.

487
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,940
Now, young lady, your own shoe.

488
00:34:00,442 --> 00:34:02,042
Don't you feel badly?

489
00:34:02,043 --> 00:34:04,443
He'll get his just desserts
one of these days.

490
00:34:05,044 --> 00:34:07,700
I'd like to be as certain of
the hereafter, Miss Jones.

491
00:34:07,701 --> 00:34:11,100
And don't lose confidence in yourself.
You could've sold them just as well.

492
00:34:11,101 --> 00:34:13,401
He only butted in 'cause he
wanted to get the bonus.

493
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:18,002
I don't remember when I've ever disliked
anyone as heartily as I do him.

494
00:34:18,103 --> 00:34:21,303
And I've disliked quite a
few people in my time.

495
00:34:21,304 --> 00:34:23,004
To their misfortune.

496
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:26,905
You just forget all about it.

497
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:29,606
I'm an elephant, Miss Jones.
A veritable elephant.

498
00:34:29,607 --> 00:34:33,007
I never forget a good deed
done me... or an ill one.

499
00:34:33,908 --> 00:34:37,000
I consider myself a
kind of divine justice.

500
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,901
Other people in this world
have to forget things.

501
00:34:39,902 --> 00:34:41,199
I do not.

502
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,000
Now, don't talk like
you're out of your mind.

503
00:34:44,001 --> 00:34:47,101
And don't be blasphemous about
divine justice. I don't like that.

504
00:34:49,002 --> 00:34:51,702
I came over here to ask you
something very important.

505
00:34:51,703 --> 00:34:52,803
What is it?

506
00:34:53,604 --> 00:34:57,404
Well, Elizabeth
asked me to ask you

507
00:34:57,405 --> 00:35:00,505
if you'd like to take her to Coney
Island tomorrow with Joe and me.

508
00:35:01,306 --> 00:35:03,606
Oh, it's Dutch treat.

509
00:35:06,307 --> 00:35:09,907
And you have to let her
know right away because...

510
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:12,308
well, Mr. Hooper's
asked her out.

511
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:15,809
- Has he ever taken her out before?
- Oh, lots of times.

512
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:18,610
- Does she like him?
- Well, uh....

513
00:35:18,611 --> 00:35:21,711
You know how it is, a girl has
to go out with someone.

514
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:25,512
He keeps asking her
and asking her.

515
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:27,913
Oh, I'd like to go, certainly.

516
00:35:27,914 --> 00:35:28,914
I'll tell her.

517
00:35:29,715 --> 00:35:31,815
Um, and there's something else.

518
00:35:32,916 --> 00:35:35,299
Now, I don't want you to
say anything to Mr. Hooper

519
00:35:35,523 --> 00:35:37,156
about the sale he
took away from you.

520
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,300
There's no use antagonizing him,
'cause after all, he can let you out.

521
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,201
He can, eh?

522
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,302
Now, promise me you won't
say anything to her.

523
00:35:45,803 --> 00:35:48,600
- Promise me?
- Oh, all right. I won't say anything.

524
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:53,401
Do you know what would
be very clever?

525
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:56,702
If you'd go over and thank
him for helping you out.

526
00:35:56,877 --> 00:35:57,577
Thank him?

527
00:35:57,603 --> 00:35:59,503
You want to keep
this job, don't you?

528
00:35:59,504 --> 00:36:01,804
You're in no position
to be independent.

529
00:36:01,805 --> 00:36:03,405
Now go on over. Go on.

530
00:36:09,906 --> 00:36:10,806
Go on.

531
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:26,207
Mr. Hooper.

532
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:36,508
Mr. Hooper.

533
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:37,800
Yes?

534
00:36:38,801 --> 00:36:41,601
Well, uh. I wanted to
say, about that sale.

535
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:45,402
- You've got quite a way with children.
- Well...

536
00:36:45,427 --> 00:36:48,627
They certainly take to you
like a duck to water.

537
00:36:48,903 --> 00:36:50,403
Hot water.

538
00:36:58,104 --> 00:37:00,404
Well, I probably couldn't have
handled it as well as you...

539
00:37:00,405 --> 00:37:03,905
As well as me? You couldn't handle
it at all. I made that sale.

540
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:08,506
Oh, I don't know. I have a hunch
those shoes are coming back.

541
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:11,407
- My sales never come back.
- Want to bet?

542
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,708
Certainly. How much?

543
00:37:17,309 --> 00:37:20,309
- Make it easy on yourself.
- How much can you afford?

544
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:23,010
Oh, I can manage to scrape
something together.

545
00:37:23,011 --> 00:37:25,711
Would ten dollars be too much?

546
00:37:25,712 --> 00:37:29,412
- Make it twenty?
- I'd be lucky if I get the ten.

547
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:30,813
I'll say so.

548
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:35,214
If you want to bet any more,
I'll give you odds.

549
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:39,215
Ten dollars. Just get back
to your slipper counter.

550
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,816
What do you think I was wig-wagging
at you for? Playing Boy Scout?

551
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,007
I... I didn't understand, sir.

552
00:37:59,015 --> 00:38:02,082
I kept indicating for you
not to buy anything.

553
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,708
That was simple enough.

554
00:38:03,709 --> 00:38:07,409
But you had given me such definite
instructions to buy the shoes, sir.

555
00:38:08,009 --> 00:38:09,009
I...

556
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,410
There's kind of a picnic tomorrow.
Everybody?s bringing something.

557
00:38:19,411 --> 00:38:21,411
I said I'd bring a
bottle of wine.

558
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:23,612
They don't think I will
because I haven't the money.

559
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,113
- Well, to the wine cellar.
- Yes, sir.

560
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:30,514
I haven't been down
here in 15 years.

561
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:33,015
No, sir, you bought most of
these before prohibition.

562
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,610
What's the best bottle of
wine in the whole place?

563
00:38:36,516 --> 00:38:38,616
The best? I would
say this is, sir.

564
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,217
Roman?e-Conti 1903.

565
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:50,618
It's good, eh?

566
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,219
There were only 24 bottles
in the world originally.

567
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:56,520
You bought 12 and the royal
family have the other 12.

568
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:58,721
Take the label off the bottle.

569
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:00,422
I don't want them to be suspicious.

570
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,023
- Label off the bottle?
- Yes.

571
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:03,024
Yes, sir.

572
00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:05,925
Very interesting, George,
my little experiment.

573
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,856
I'm glad you are
enjoying yourself, sir.

574
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:09,357
I watch the little ants scurry around

575
00:39:09,392 --> 00:39:11,959
and I know each and every one is
going to get his just desserts.

576
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:13,058
I am sure they are.

577
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:15,359
That Joe, Mary's fellow...

578
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:18,660
Bad. An evil influence
on the girl.

579
00:39:18,661 --> 00:39:21,661
Kind of Svengali corrupting
her whole viewpoint.

580
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:24,262
- Yes, sir.
- I'm going to break that up tomorrow.

581
00:39:24,263 --> 00:39:26,363
I'll talk her out of that.

582
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,600
And then there's Hooper.

583
00:39:28,801 --> 00:39:30,701
A petty tyrant.

584
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,502
Well, he's going
to get his reward.

585
00:39:34,503 --> 00:39:36,403
Then there's Elizabeth...

586
00:39:37,104 --> 00:39:39,304
- Well, come on, up with you.
- Yes, sir.

587
00:40:00,905 --> 00:40:04,305
Oh dear, I knew I forgot
something. The pickles!

588
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:09,006
Hey, you little guttersnipe! Why
don't you look where you're going?

589
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:13,307
Do you understand Italian?

590
00:40:13,308 --> 00:40:14,808
I understand that. He-he.

591
00:40:16,409 --> 00:40:19,800
Say, would it be too much to ask you
two millionaires to lend a hand here?

592
00:40:19,801 --> 00:40:22,601
Woman's place in the world
is to tend the male.

593
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:25,602
Not this woman and not this male.
Here, open it.

594
00:40:26,203 --> 00:40:28,203
Why don't we try my wine?

595
00:40:28,204 --> 00:40:31,404
Oh, I've never been
interested in domestic wine.

596
00:40:33,505 --> 00:40:35,705
This isn't exactly domestic.

597
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:40,006
Oh, Tom, you shouldn't have
spent your money for this.

598
00:40:40,007 --> 00:40:43,307
Oh well. You only live once.

599
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:45,708
Skol!

600
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,209
- But I don't know what it means.
- Ha-ha.

601
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:54,010
Well?

602
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,610
You like it, don't you?

603
00:40:58,011 --> 00:41:02,811
Yeah. Well, I tell you Tom,
it's not really bad, it's...

604
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:05,213
Tom, did you spend more
than 50 cents for this?

605
00:41:05,214 --> 00:41:09,400
- 50 cents for...
- Oh, Tom, they saw you coming.

606
00:41:09,401 --> 00:41:13,400
Who saw me coming? You mean
you don't like this wine?

607
00:41:13,401 --> 00:41:14,701
Say, I got a good
mind to return it

608
00:41:14,705 --> 00:41:16,272
and make them give
you your money back.

609
00:41:16,302 --> 00:41:18,400
- Oh, the nerve of some people.
- Gee whiz.

610
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:21,401
Now wait a minute. You're not
giving this wine a fair chance.

611
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:24,002
Hey, I got an idea.
Just a second.

612
00:41:28,203 --> 00:41:29,603
Look here.

613
00:41:31,104 --> 00:41:33,704
We'll open this and put some
of this in it. See?

614
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:35,805
Put some of this in.

615
00:41:35,806 --> 00:41:38,206
No, come on, it'll
help kill the taste.

616
00:41:45,907 --> 00:41:48,107
Well, skol again.

617
00:41:51,908 --> 00:41:54,400
- No.
- It's no use.

618
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:56,801
No. Guess you can't save it.

619
00:41:59,222 --> 00:42:01,002
It's a shame, really.

620
00:42:01,003 --> 00:42:03,403
Too bad we had to
ruin a bottle of pop.

621
00:42:03,404 --> 00:42:04,604
Isn't it?

622
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:07,505
Pour it out, Tom. It
might make you sick.

623
00:42:08,906 --> 00:42:10,406
I am sick.

624
00:42:11,507 --> 00:42:13,307
Wine experts!

625
00:42:13,308 --> 00:42:17,600
Now, here's a bottle of wine
that's really a bottle of wine.

626
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:21,801
This was made by our
iceman's grandfather.

627
00:42:22,602 --> 00:42:24,802
Same as he used to do
in the old country.

628
00:42:24,803 --> 00:42:28,503
He puts the grapes in the
bathtub and he jumps on 'em.

629
00:42:29,804 --> 00:42:31,004
I saw him do it.

630
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:42,205
Ah! Real jumped-on grapes, huh?

631
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:44,006
Why didn't he take
his socks off?

632
00:42:45,707 --> 00:42:47,307
I knew you'd like it.

633
00:42:47,308 --> 00:42:49,508
Well, I'm going for a swim.

634
00:42:49,509 --> 00:42:51,209
See you all in a minute.

635
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:54,090
- Ha-ha!
- Ouch!

636
00:42:54,091 --> 00:42:56,291
Now, don't show off
and swim way out!

637
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:58,702
We'll be watching you!

638
00:42:58,703 --> 00:43:01,703
Say, maybe the Pregbury man will
have some extra pickles he'll sell.

639
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:03,515
 I'll be back in a minute.

640
00:43:05,804 --> 00:43:07,704
Don't worry.
Nothing will happen to him.

641
00:43:08,805 --> 00:43:11,105
Ah. He's a pretty good swimmer.

642
00:43:11,406 --> 00:43:13,006
He's pretty good at everything.

643
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:16,507
- You wouldn't be prejudiced?
- Maybe.

644
00:43:17,908 --> 00:43:20,908
Is it possible you're reading
virtues into him that don't exist?

645
00:43:22,709 --> 00:43:23,809
Don't you like him?

646
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,210
What makes you say that?

647
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:29,511
Well, I was watching you on the subway and
thought that you were making faces at him.

648
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:32,212
My feet were hurting me.

649
00:43:34,313 --> 00:43:35,913
But you're not really
crazy about him.

650
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:38,099
Well, that depends upon how
much you're in love with him.

651
00:43:38,101 --> 00:43:40,700
And I don't think
you're any judge.

652
00:43:42,002 --> 00:43:43,502
Who's a better one?

653
00:43:43,503 --> 00:43:46,403
Any outsider.
Me, for instance.

654
00:43:46,505 --> 00:43:51,105
Now, look around us.
There's a couple over there.

655
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:53,106
They think they were
made for each other.

656
00:43:57,307 --> 00:43:59,100
He's biting her ear.

657
00:44:00,308 --> 00:44:02,199
Now she's biting his ear.

658
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:04,900
Very touching.

659
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:06,301
I think so.

660
00:44:06,302 --> 00:44:08,802
They've found each
other, haven't they?

661
00:44:08,803 --> 00:44:13,303
Out of this whole wide world, these two
were lucky enough to come together.

662
00:44:13,304 --> 00:44:17,004
But don't you think if
she hadn't met him

663
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,803
there wouldn't be somebody
else biting her ear now?

664
00:44:19,805 --> 00:44:23,505
And don't you think he wouldn't
be at some other girl's ear?

665
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:24,792
Probably ten feet away?

666
00:44:25,907 --> 00:44:29,307
Maybe. But that doesn't
prove anything.

667
00:44:30,909 --> 00:44:36,009
Scientists can write all the books they
like about love being a trap of nature.

668
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,410
I remember reading that.

669
00:44:38,411 --> 00:44:43,000
That it's biology and the chemistry
inside a woman that fools her.

670
00:44:43,201 --> 00:44:46,601
But all the scientists are going
to convince are other scientists

671
00:44:46,656 --> 00:44:47,856
not women in love.

672
00:44:50,502 --> 00:44:53,702
I don't say Joe is the greatest
thing that ever lived.

673
00:44:54,703 --> 00:44:57,403
I probably wouldn't
love him if he was.

674
00:44:57,404 --> 00:44:59,004
I'd just want to look at him.

675
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:02,600
But you see, I'm not the greatest
girl in the world, either.

676
00:45:04,301 --> 00:45:07,199
Two people look at each other

677
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,700
and they see something
way deep inside

678
00:45:11,701 --> 00:45:14,201
that nobody else can.

679
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:16,602
And that's it.

680
00:45:18,603 --> 00:45:21,503
I wouldn't be surprised if
the greatest love affair

681
00:45:21,504 --> 00:45:23,704
in the world was between a
Chinaman wearing a pigtail

682
00:45:23,705 --> 00:45:26,205
and a girl who's missing
two front teeth

683
00:45:26,206 --> 00:45:27,606
if you could measure it.

684
00:45:28,407 --> 00:45:30,707
If they feel it, they feel it.

685
00:45:30,708 --> 00:45:35,008
- Do you?
- Not the way you see in the movies.

686
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:37,509
Or hear in those
songs, you know...

687
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:41,310
about the touch of your
hand, you set me on fire.

688
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:44,000
I guess I'm not the
combustible type.

689
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:48,300
But when I'm with him

690
00:45:48,301 --> 00:45:53,001
I don't know if it's the
advertised 7th heaven.

691
00:45:53,702 --> 00:45:57,402
We get along just average, I guess.
Little arguing...

692
00:45:58,103 --> 00:46:01,703
Even maybe being a little bored
now and then if we admit it.

693
00:46:02,304 --> 00:46:06,004
But yet if I knew I'd
never see him again...

694
00:46:06,005 --> 00:46:07,199
Yes?

695
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,000
I've never even thought of
what it would be like

696
00:46:14,801 --> 00:46:16,701
not to see him anymore.

697
00:46:18,802 --> 00:46:20,602
I guess that's the test of it.

698
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:24,199
If I thought

699
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,700
I'd never see him again

700
00:46:34,701 --> 00:46:37,401
I don't think I'd care
if I lived or died.

701
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:46,702
Look! I found some pretzels.

702
00:46:48,203 --> 00:46:52,200
They're homemade. The Pregbury
man's wife makes them.

703
00:46:52,401 --> 00:46:54,801
- From her own recipe.
- Don't they look delicious?

704
00:46:54,802 --> 00:46:56,302
Gangway!

705
00:46:57,003 --> 00:46:58,803
Oh boy! Pretzels!

706
00:46:58,804 --> 00:47:00,104
Oh, Joe! No!

707
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:03,705
Don't you dare! You'll
spoil your lunch!

708
00:47:04,292 --> 00:47:05,292
Joe! No!

709
00:47:18,206 --> 00:47:20,506
Joe! Spit it out!
Spit it out, Joe!

710
00:47:44,807 --> 00:47:46,107
I beg your pardon.

711
00:47:46,508 --> 00:47:50,200
I was wondering if I could find out
whether my clothes are in this bathhouse?

712
00:47:50,201 --> 00:47:53,801
- Did you take them off in here?
- Well, I don't exactly remember.

713
00:47:53,802 --> 00:47:56,002
Where's your locker key?
That's got our name on it.

714
00:47:56,003 --> 00:47:59,303
I shared the locker with a young
friend of mine, he has the key.

715
00:47:59,304 --> 00:48:02,604
But unfortunately I can't find him
or any of the people I came with.

716
00:48:02,605 --> 00:48:06,605
- I've been walking about for hours.
- Does this look like the place?

717
00:48:08,106 --> 00:48:11,506
I rented this suit. Can you
tell me if it's yours?

718
00:48:12,707 --> 00:48:14,907
Not ours. That's a
pretty cheap suit.

719
00:48:14,908 --> 00:48:16,808
Not yours.

720
00:48:17,509 --> 00:48:18,709
Thank you.

721
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:25,200
Ain't ours.

722
00:48:26,401 --> 00:48:27,601
Thanks.

723
00:48:32,202 --> 00:48:33,602
It don't belong to us.

724
00:48:34,603 --> 00:48:37,003
How many bathhouses are
there around here?

725
00:48:37,004 --> 00:48:40,204
- A couple of hundred.
- A couple of hundred?

726
00:48:41,405 --> 00:48:42,605
Thanks.

727
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,306
Young man.

728
00:49:37,807 --> 00:49:38,807
Yes, sir?

729
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:40,308
I've got a big bargain for you.

730
00:49:40,709 --> 00:49:43,500
How would you like to give me
a dollar or two for this gold watch?

731
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:45,901
You mean, uh, you want to
leave it for security?

732
00:49:45,946 --> 00:49:48,146
No, I don't think I'll
be down here again.

733
00:49:48,202 --> 00:49:50,982
- I'll let you have it for a dollar.
- A dollar?

734
00:49:49,483 --> 00:49:53,483
That's all. It's a
very fine watch.

735
00:49:53,884 --> 00:49:55,804
Solid gold. Here,
take a look at it.

736
00:49:58,605 --> 00:50:01,105
Yes. Mh-hm.

737
00:50:01,906 --> 00:50:04,906
Uh, would you mind if I showed this
to the boss? I'll only be a second.

738
00:50:04,907 --> 00:50:06,907
I only want a dollar for it.

739
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,508
This is a pretty good
watch for a dollar, Pop.

740
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:24,209
- You got any more?
- For heaven's sake!

741
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:25,710
No need to get excited.

742
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:28,142
There's been a lot of stuff
stolen from lockers around here

743
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:29,236
and we're just checking up.

744
00:50:29,311 --> 00:50:31,211
Well, I assure you that
watch is not stolen.

745
00:50:31,212 --> 00:50:33,812
It's an awful good watch
to go for a buck.

746
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:35,813
Officer, I've lost the
friends I came with.

747
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:37,314
I can't find my bathhouse

748
00:50:37,315 --> 00:50:40,215
and I've been walking around for hours
trying to trace this rented suit.

749
00:50:40,716 --> 00:50:42,800
I want to sell the watch
so I can telephone my home

750
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,380
and have my car and
chauffeur come for me.

751
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:46,601
- Oh, you have a car and chauffeur?
- Yes, I have.

752
00:50:46,702 --> 00:50:49,200
- And you rent a bathing suit?
- No, my ...

753
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:52,401
- Where did you get this watch?
- Well, if you want to know...

754
00:50:52,476 --> 00:50:54,376
The Governor gave it
to me on my birthday.

755
00:50:54,402 --> 00:50:57,502
The Governor?
My boss works for him.

756
00:50:57,503 --> 00:51:00,003
Now, what do you say we go
down and pay him a little visit?

757
00:51:00,054 --> 00:51:02,454
- You know, kind of friendly-like.
- You let go my arm!

758
00:51:02,504 --> 00:51:04,004
Now, now. Be a good boy, Pop.
Come on.

759
00:51:04,005 --> 00:51:06,705
- Come on.
- Take your hand off of me.

760
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:19,406
...pretty monotonous. And I'm getting good
and sick of seeing your ugly little face.

761
00:51:19,407 --> 00:51:22,607
You're not even a good pickpocket. When are
you going to get sense enough to quit?

762
00:51:22,608 --> 00:51:25,008
- Take him away. Marv.
- Yes, sir. Come on.

763
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:30,809
He was trying to sell this watch
to a clerk in a drugstore for a dollar.

764
00:51:30,810 --> 00:51:34,310
When I questioned him about it, he said he
wanted the money to call his chauffeur.

765
00:51:34,311 --> 00:51:37,911
And beside that he told me that he
got the watch from the Governor.

766
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,702
I thought that
sounded suspicious.

767
00:51:40,803 --> 00:51:42,303
Suspicious enough for me...

768
00:51:42,355 --> 00:51:45,088
I would advise you two simple
guardians of law and order

769
00:51:45,104 --> 00:51:47,704
for the sake of your
own future security

770
00:51:47,705 --> 00:51:50,905
to be very careful of any
decision you make concerning me.

771
00:51:50,906 --> 00:51:53,800
- How was that again?
- Tom!

772
00:51:53,801 --> 00:51:56,401
Tom, we've been looking
everywhere for you!

773
00:51:56,402 --> 00:51:59,202
Joe's running up and down the boardwalk
and Elizabeth's gone to the hospital.

774
00:51:59,203 --> 00:52:01,600
- What happened to you?
- I got lost.

775
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:05,301
My! Well thank heaven
you're all in one piece.

776
00:52:05,302 --> 00:52:08,202
- Thanks for finding him, officer.
- That's all right, miss.

777
00:52:08,203 --> 00:52:10,703
You can call your
chauffeur from here.

778
00:52:10,704 --> 00:52:11,904
Here.

779
00:52:11,905 --> 00:52:13,605
What chauffeur?

780
00:52:14,806 --> 00:52:15,906
What chauffeur?

781
00:52:15,907 --> 00:52:18,107
The chauffeur that you
were going to call.

782
00:52:19,308 --> 00:52:21,100
- Me?
- Certainly you.

783
00:52:21,801 --> 00:52:23,500
I haven't got any chauffeur.

784
00:52:24,701 --> 00:52:27,199
Wasn't he trying to get money
to call his chauffeur?

785
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,700
That's what he told me.

786
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:31,101
Say, what's going on here?

787
00:52:31,902 --> 00:52:33,402
I don't know what
he's talking about.

788
00:52:33,443 --> 00:52:35,476
Oh, you must be mistaking
him for somebody else.

789
00:52:35,503 --> 00:52:37,403
Say, what do you two
do for a living?

790
00:52:39,504 --> 00:52:41,204
We work, of course.

791
00:52:41,505 --> 00:52:42,605
Where?

792
00:52:44,706 --> 00:52:46,199
Don't list the store.
We'll get fired.

793
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,800
Hey, stop that!

794
00:52:52,601 --> 00:52:54,100
Where do you work?

795
00:52:54,901 --> 00:52:56,001
At the Automat.

796
00:52:56,102 --> 00:52:57,402
What do you do?

797
00:52:57,503 --> 00:53:00,803
I have charge of blueberry pies.
I put them in those little boxes.

798
00:53:03,204 --> 00:53:04,600
And what do you do?

799
00:53:05,701 --> 00:53:08,401
I, uh... I help him. I...

800
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:11,802
I snap the boxes shut.

801
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,003
There's something
fishy going on here.

802
00:53:17,004 --> 00:53:21,500
My feet hurt. Can't we continue
this while we're seated?

803
00:53:21,501 --> 00:53:23,901
You know, you ought to
be ashamed of yourself.

804
00:53:23,902 --> 00:53:26,602
Supposing someone treated
your father like this.

805
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:28,803
Is he your father?

806
00:53:29,504 --> 00:53:30,504
Yes.

807
00:53:30,505 --> 00:53:33,605
Girlie, I catch you in more lies
than you can shake a stick at.

808
00:53:33,606 --> 00:53:38,006
If he's your father, why did you call
him Tom when you came in here?

809
00:53:38,607 --> 00:53:41,507
I always call him Tom.
My goodness!

810
00:53:41,567 --> 00:53:44,767
Is there a law against calling
your own father by his first name?

811
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:46,900
Come with me, miss.

812
00:53:54,001 --> 00:53:55,300
Where were you born?

813
00:53:56,101 --> 00:53:58,900
- In New York.
- Shhh, keep your voice down.

814
00:54:00,001 --> 00:54:01,600
What street?

815
00:54:04,201 --> 00:54:06,501
Uh, 121st street.

816
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:17,402
What street was she born on?

817
00:54:17,403 --> 00:54:18,603
Look at me!

818
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,204
72nd street?

819
00:54:26,405 --> 00:54:29,605
They're the ones that have been selling
this hot stuff all right. I'll bet on it.

820
00:54:29,606 --> 00:54:31,606
How much do you want to bet?

821
00:54:31,607 --> 00:54:34,907
Mary! Where did
you disappear to?

822
00:54:34,908 --> 00:54:36,608
I got lost, and I
couldn't find...

823
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:38,509
Quiet, everybody, quiet.

824
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:41,800
I'm telling you two that anything
you say may be used against you.

825
00:54:41,801 --> 00:54:44,401
- So, uh, use your own judgment.
- What happened?

826
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:48,002
Joe, you better go home.
We'll met you later.

827
00:54:48,003 --> 00:54:49,203
Quiet, you!

828
00:54:49,204 --> 00:54:51,404
How well do you know these two?

829
00:54:51,446 --> 00:54:54,213
Well, I know them well enough to
know they haven't done anything.

830
00:54:54,405 --> 00:54:55,805
Where do they work?

831
00:54:55,806 --> 00:54:57,606
- Uh... Mary, stop that!
- Come on!

832
00:54:57,607 --> 00:55:00,107
- The Neeley Department Store.
- Ah-haa!

833
00:55:00,108 --> 00:55:02,208
Ah-haa! Some detective!

834
00:55:03,159 --> 00:55:05,509
Are they, uh, father
and daughter?

835
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:08,300
Uh... yes... no, they're not!
What are you...

836
00:55:08,301 --> 00:55:10,001
Joe, please don't say anything more.

837
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:12,902
I don't want to have to tell you
to keep quiet again, girlie.

838
00:55:12,903 --> 00:55:15,803
How about using a more
civil tone, officer?

839
00:55:15,804 --> 00:55:17,400
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

840
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:20,500
- Have they charged you with anything?
- No.

841
00:55:20,601 --> 00:55:22,601
Then you don't have to stay here.
Come on out.

842
00:55:22,602 --> 00:55:24,400
Hey, stay right here!

843
00:55:24,401 --> 00:55:28,300
Look, you can't hold people here unless
you've got a charge preferred against them!

844
00:55:28,301 --> 00:55:30,101
I can fix that.

845
00:55:30,102 --> 00:55:32,402
Was he dressed like
that in the drugstore?

846
00:55:32,403 --> 00:55:33,703
Yes, sir.

847
00:55:33,704 --> 00:55:36,800
Violating a city ordinance, wearing a
bathing suit on the boardwalk.

848
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:38,601
How do you like
that for a charge?

849
00:55:38,687 --> 00:55:40,487
A great many other people
were wearing bathing suits.

850
00:55:40,502 --> 00:55:43,302
Well, are you satisfied, or would
you like to see another charge?

851
00:55:43,803 --> 00:55:45,603
- You just try it.
- Really?

852
00:55:45,604 --> 00:55:48,800
Did he come along peaceful
or did he pull on your arm?

853
00:55:48,801 --> 00:55:51,901
- He made quite a protest.
- He did, eh? OK.

854
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:55,199
Resisting an officer. Would you
like to see another charge?

855
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,100
- I'd like it fine!
- Say!

856
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:59,201
- Trespassing.
- Suits me.

857
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,202
- Soliciting funds.
- Keep on.

858
00:56:01,203 --> 00:56:04,393
- Peddling without a license.
- Ha-ha, you're not frightening me.

859
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,494
Stop! He's frightening me.

860
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,495
And we'll throw in a little case of
vagrancy. How does that suit you?

861
00:56:09,496 --> 00:56:10,796
That's just dandy.

862
00:56:10,797 --> 00:56:14,197
- A vagrant. Me?
- We haven't even started on you yet.

863
00:56:14,698 --> 00:56:16,198
Young man, what do you think
you're accomplishing?

864
00:56:16,255 --> 00:56:18,155
I'm giving him enough
rope to hang himself.

865
00:56:18,199 --> 00:56:23,399
You're giving me enough rope? I've
got a little surprise for you, too.

866
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,300
I'm charging you with
obstructing justice.

867
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:29,301
- Fine.
- And contempt of police authority.

868
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,302
Fine.

869
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:32,566
And suspicion of inciting
a group to riot.

870
00:56:32,603 --> 00:56:33,803
Fine.

871
00:56:33,804 --> 00:56:37,004
What's the matter? Your imagination
running out of charges?

872
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:39,505
Are you an idiot?
Who do you think this man is?

873
00:56:39,506 --> 00:56:43,406
This man is a servant of the people,
that's all. And a darn poor one at that.

874
00:56:43,407 --> 00:56:46,307
I don't work for him,
he works for me.

875
00:56:46,308 --> 00:56:47,900
How do you like that?

876
00:56:47,901 --> 00:56:50,901
Let him put me in jail. I'll holler
my head off. This is a free country.

877
00:56:50,902 --> 00:56:53,602
You let a guy say you were spitting
on the sidewalk when you weren't

878
00:56:53,603 --> 00:56:55,703
and the next thing he'll do
is tear up the Constitution.

879
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:57,199
Say, are you crazy?

880
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,400
Yes, I'm a little crazy.

881
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:03,301
But that happens to me my
particular kind of patriotism

882
00:57:03,302 --> 00:57:06,702
I don't care how small the right is
you're trying to take away from me.

883
00:57:06,703 --> 00:57:08,603
I'll fight for it.

884
00:57:08,604 --> 00:57:10,704
The Boston Tea Party was
started over one penny.

885
00:57:10,705 --> 00:57:13,199
This is big enough for me.

886
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,800
Well, put me in jail.

887
00:57:15,801 --> 00:57:18,200
Don't tell me what to do.
I'm running this place.

888
00:57:18,201 --> 00:57:20,501
Go on! Lock me up!
You've got enough charges.

889
00:57:20,602 --> 00:57:22,302
I'll lock you up when
I'm good and ready.

890
00:57:22,528 --> 00:57:24,295
OK, take your time.

891
00:57:25,803 --> 00:57:29,303
We, the People of the United States,
in order to form a more perfect union

892
00:57:29,304 --> 00:57:33,204
establish justice, ensure
domestic tranquility

893
00:57:33,205 --> 00:57:35,705
provide for the common
defense, promo...

894
00:57:36,506 --> 00:57:39,506
Don't look so startled, sergeant.
In case you didn't recognize it

895
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:41,469
that's the beginning
of our Constitution.

896
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:44,307
I'll recite it for you.
Where was I? Oh, yes...

897
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:46,508
Provide for the common defense...

898
00:57:46,509 --> 00:57:50,200
There he is. If he thinks he's
right, he won't give into anybody.

899
00:57:50,201 --> 00:57:53,001
- Isn't it wonderful?
- It isn't very practical.

900
00:57:53,902 --> 00:57:56,602
No, he isn't. But
he's wonderful!

901
00:57:56,603 --> 00:57:59,503
I also know some of the
Declaration of Independence.

902
00:57:59,504 --> 00:58:02,404
I might get a couple of the words
wrong, but you'll get the general idea.

903
00:58:03,205 --> 00:58:05,605
When, in the course of human events,
it becomes necessary to...

904
00:58:05,606 --> 00:58:07,806
- I don't like this.
- Neither do I.

905
00:58:07,807 --> 00:58:10,807
When they start reciting the
Constitution, look out.

906
00:58:10,808 --> 00:58:13,408
We had a nut like this downtown once.
It was awful.

907
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:16,409
- What can one fellow like him do?
- It's not him, but it gets in the papers.

908
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:20,010
That somebody sends down a big lawyer, then
you ought to see what happens in court.

909
00:58:20,011 --> 00:58:22,611
- You'd think it was a big murder trial.
- What? For a little thing like this?

910
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:25,712
The way they mix it up? Turns out
that Abraham Lincoln's on trial.

911
00:58:25,713 --> 00:58:28,600
- Lincoln?
- Trial downtown took over two weeks.

912
00:58:28,601 --> 00:58:31,201
Two weeks? My vacation
starts Wednesday.

913
00:58:31,202 --> 00:58:33,602
Oh, but you'll spend it
listening to Abraham Lincoln.

914
00:58:33,603 --> 00:58:36,700
In a nice hot courtroom.
My wife would skin me alive.

915
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:40,301
One of them reporters will be here any
minute now. You know what'll happen then.

916
00:58:40,602 --> 00:58:41,702
Yeah.

917
00:58:42,103 --> 00:58:43,403
Quiet!

918
00:58:43,904 --> 00:58:46,904
A lucky thing for you that
I feel charitable today.

919
00:58:46,905 --> 00:58:49,805
I'm gonna to suspend charges
on both of you. Go on.

920
00:58:49,806 --> 00:58:51,706
Oh, no you don't. Wait a minute!

921
00:58:52,807 --> 00:58:55,207
You're not going to
get off that easy!

922
00:58:55,208 --> 00:58:57,008
I'm not going to get off?

923
00:58:57,009 --> 00:59:00,509
We don't want any suspended
charges hanging over our heads.

924
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:05,210
- What do you want? An apology?
- Well, what's wrong with that?

925
00:59:05,211 --> 00:59:07,511
You humiliated this man.

926
00:59:07,896 --> 00:59:10,129
You dragged him in here barefooted,
questioned him like a criminal

927
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:12,312
and you think an
apology's too much?

928
00:59:12,913 --> 00:59:14,713
Boys! Throw him out!

929
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:20,114
I'm not going to move one step until those
charges are not suspended, but dropped.

930
00:59:21,615 --> 00:59:23,515
All right, they're dropped.

931
00:59:24,716 --> 00:59:26,816
And I apologize.

932
00:59:27,717 --> 00:59:29,417
Now get out of here!

933
00:59:29,418 --> 00:59:31,918
I didn't that you'd have
the grace to apologize.

934
00:59:31,919 --> 00:59:34,319
Even in that tone
it's appreciated.

935
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,100
And stay out of this precinct,
or I'll have you arrested.

936
00:59:39,401 --> 00:59:40,901
Go on about your business.

937
00:59:47,002 --> 00:59:50,600
Next time you bring a thing like that in
here, I'll throw you right into the ocean.

938
00:59:50,603 --> 00:59:52,303
Yes, sir. I mean no, sir.

939
00:59:54,104 --> 00:59:55,304
Lincoln!

940
01:00:00,505 --> 01:00:03,705
Say, we'd better get you dressed.
You two try to cool off on the sand.

941
01:00:03,706 --> 01:00:04,706
Joe?

942
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:11,007
What's that for?

943
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:12,508
Because you're wonderful.

944
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:16,309
Some wonderful.
Come on.

945
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:36,510
It's getting pretty late. We
better wake 'em up and go home.

946
01:00:41,811 --> 01:00:45,911
Oh, let's let 'em sleep a while longer.
They must be awfully tired.

947
01:00:48,712 --> 01:00:50,712
You know, he didn't
like you very much.

948
01:00:51,413 --> 01:00:54,913
But I think he changed his opinion in
the police station. I was watching him.

949
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:59,414
Whether that old goat likes me or not,
it certainly doesn't change my life.

950
01:00:59,415 --> 01:01:01,615
Did you watch what
he's been eating?

951
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:05,516
He acts like a guy that just
discovered his stomach.

952
01:01:06,417 --> 01:01:09,207
I don't think a goat could
put that stuff away.

953
01:01:11,608 --> 01:01:14,608
You know, you're making
him a responsibility.

954
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
I want him to marry Elizabeth.

955
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:21,901
- Oh.
- Why shouldn't they get married?

956
01:01:21,902 --> 01:01:24,402
- Well, why should they?
- Because she loves him.

957
01:01:24,403 --> 01:01:26,900
- How do you know?
- I can tell.

958
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:31,201
It'd be wonderful for him.
He must be very lonely.

959
01:01:32,902 --> 01:01:37,702
It doesn't make any difference how many
people you talk to during the day.

960
01:01:37,703 --> 01:01:42,303
If you haven't got someone that
really cares for you

961
01:01:43,204 --> 01:01:45,204
you're all alone.

962
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:49,205
You're one person
against the world

963
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,106
unless you have someone.

964
01:01:51,107 --> 01:01:55,007
Then it's only half as hard.

965
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:57,708
At least you're two against the world.

966
01:01:57,709 --> 01:02:02,199
So you both starve, instead
of starving alone.

967
01:02:03,910 --> 01:02:07,010
Joe... Don't let
yourself get depressed.

968
01:02:07,011 --> 01:02:10,211
It's all over, Mary.
We've lost.

969
01:02:10,712 --> 01:02:12,602
What do you mean, we've lost?

970
01:02:16,503 --> 01:02:19,703
400 employees out
of a possible 2500.

971
01:02:20,704 --> 01:02:22,204
How can you blame them?

972
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:26,505
Black list, store detectives.

973
01:02:27,206 --> 01:02:29,506
I don't see how we got the 400.

974
01:02:29,507 --> 01:02:34,207
- Maybe if you gave it more time, Joe.
- Time? We had a year already.

975
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,700
So we'd have a 100 more, they'd
walk out like sheep to the slaughter.

976
01:02:37,701 --> 01:02:42,101
People like this who starve quietly
wishing they hadn't joined.

977
01:02:42,102 --> 01:02:45,102
Oh, it's doomed,
Mary, I know it.

978
01:02:45,903 --> 01:02:48,903
Got the poor suckers into working,
at least keep their jobs.

979
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:53,404
Joe, if you could only
reach all of them.

980
01:02:53,405 --> 01:02:55,505
Yeah, if, if, sure.

981
01:02:55,506 --> 01:02:59,706
If the store would only ask 'em all to go out
to Bryant Park and let me speak to them.

982
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:06,407
Mary, I want to talk to you.

983
01:03:07,908 --> 01:03:13,308
I meant to do it when I brought you
home, but now's as good a time as any.

984
01:03:14,509 --> 01:03:16,709
I can't get a job in New York.

985
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:23,810
Mary, I... I can't see you anymore.
For a while.

986
01:03:29,211 --> 01:03:30,511
What do you mean?

987
01:03:30,512 --> 01:03:34,700
Well, I... I can't. I
can't take up your time.

988
01:03:36,401 --> 01:03:40,300
Is that what you call our
relationship? Taking up my time?

989
01:03:40,502 --> 01:03:43,602
I haven't got the right to take up your
time, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

990
01:03:43,603 --> 01:03:46,803
Well, I think that you might
ask my opinion about that.

991
01:03:47,804 --> 01:03:50,604
What are your plans, Joe? What do
you want to do? Go out of town?

992
01:03:50,605 --> 01:03:53,805
I'll go with you, that's not
such a terrible thing to ask.

993
01:03:53,806 --> 01:03:56,106
- Oh, Mary you'd...
- But I'd love to if you want me.

994
01:03:56,107 --> 01:03:59,600
Oh, I wish you'd marry
me, just like it is.

995
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:02,201
- I'm not afraid.
- Marriage?

996
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:06,102
You're not afraid. No,
women are never afraid.

997
01:04:06,103 --> 01:04:09,203
How long do you think you'd be in
love with me, living off your salary?

998
01:04:09,204 --> 01:04:11,604
That's nothing to be ashamed
of, if you can't help it.

999
01:04:11,605 --> 01:04:13,505
Not to you, but it is to me.

1000
01:04:13,506 --> 01:04:18,406
I bought me a $5 wallet for my birthday
and left the sales slip in so I could

1001
01:04:18,419 --> 01:04:19,452
trade it in for the money.

1002
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:22,207
Oh, who are we fooling? The next
step will be giving me the money.

1003
01:04:22,208 --> 01:04:25,908
A quarter at a time, for lunch,
for carfare, for cigarettes...

1004
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:28,609
I can't be in love under
those conditions.

1005
01:04:28,610 --> 01:04:30,210
I... I don't want to marry you.

1006
01:04:39,711 --> 01:04:40,911
Honey, I...

1007
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:45,812
I shouldn't have done that. I didn't
have any right to ask you to marry me.

1008
01:04:45,813 --> 01:04:49,213
I don't own you, you know,
even though I do act like it.

1009
01:04:50,214 --> 01:04:52,414
We've got to look
at it sensibly.

1010
01:04:54,115 --> 01:04:57,305
Maybe, it'll still turn out
all right in some way.

1011
01:04:57,306 --> 01:05:01,500
But I... I couldn't go away
obligating you to wait for me.

1012
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,701
That's very considerate
of you, at least.

1013
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:09,302
Maybe I hope you'll wait for me.

1014
01:05:09,303 --> 01:05:12,803
But you're young and attractive,
you got a whole life ahead of you.

1015
01:05:12,804 --> 01:05:15,104
Go out and meet people,
have a good time.

1016
01:05:15,105 --> 01:05:17,005
It's certainly coming to you.

1017
01:05:17,006 --> 01:05:20,506
Who knows? You might get
interested in somebody wonderful.

1018
01:05:22,007 --> 01:05:25,807
Yeah. That's what someone
was telling me recently.

1019
01:05:25,808 --> 01:05:30,608
That's what nature does, let you
get interested in other people.

1020
01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:32,609
It's a kind of protection.

1021
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:36,610
Well...

1022
01:05:37,411 --> 01:05:41,011
Then I don't promise to wait for
you, if that'll make you happy.

1023
01:05:42,712 --> 01:05:44,500
What do you intend to do, Joe?

1024
01:05:44,501 --> 01:05:47,701
Uh, why, the government's taking
young fellas for construction work.

1025
01:05:48,702 --> 01:05:52,002
Down in Panama. I'd have a
trade by the time I get back.

1026
01:05:53,103 --> 01:05:57,803
You only have to stay a little while.
Two or three years, I think.

1027
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:01,604
Two or three years?

1028
01:06:03,205 --> 01:06:08,005
Why, I... I thought you meant
you'd only be gone a few months.

1029
01:06:10,506 --> 01:06:13,906
Why, you're nothing but a coward.
That's what you are.

1030
01:06:15,107 --> 01:06:19,507
For all your bravery in police
stations you can't even face life.

1031
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,000
Half the world's
starving to death

1032
01:06:22,001 --> 01:06:25,601
and you're afraid to get married because
you might not be able to get a job.

1033
01:06:25,602 --> 01:06:27,202
It's not me I'm worrying about.

1034
01:06:27,203 --> 01:06:30,503
I'm not going to get locked up in a hall
bedroom watching you iron my shirts

1035
01:06:30,504 --> 01:06:32,104
and nobody's going to make me.

1036
01:06:33,205 --> 01:06:35,805
Nobody's going to
make you do anything.

1037
01:06:35,806 --> 01:06:38,606
- Go on to Panama, go any place you like...
- Oh, Mary, now...

1038
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:40,607
Right now you can go on home.

1039
01:06:41,508 --> 01:06:43,908
Go on, unless you're
afraid of the dark.

1040
01:07:11,709 --> 01:07:13,209
Better keep it.

1041
01:07:33,510 --> 01:07:35,510
It's going to turn
out all right.

1042
01:07:36,511 --> 01:07:38,511
I've got a seventh sense.

1043
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:41,612
- You mean a sixth sense.
- I mean a seventh sense.

1044
01:07:41,613 --> 01:07:44,513
I've got a sixth sense
and a seventh sense.

1045
01:07:45,014 --> 01:07:47,314
It's going to turn
out all right.

1046
01:07:48,215 --> 01:07:51,215
You really shouldn't drink.
It isn't good for you.

1047
01:07:51,216 --> 01:07:53,816
Three glasses of beer. You
can't get drunk on that.

1048
01:07:53,817 --> 01:07:55,417
- You are.
- Oh...

1049
01:07:56,818 --> 01:07:58,518
- Elizabeth?
- Yes, Tom?

1050
01:07:58,519 --> 01:08:00,619
- I want you to tell me something.
- What is it?

1051
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:03,920
Didn't Hooper ask you out today?

1052
01:08:04,621 --> 01:08:07,721
- Yes, he did.
- Well, why did you go with me instead?

1053
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:13,122
- You really want to know?
- Certainly.

1054
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:15,823
- You won't laugh at me?
- Of course not.

1055
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:19,924
Well, Mr. Hooper is the...
Well, he's the executive type

1056
01:08:19,925 --> 01:08:23,625
and you're sort of helpless and
need someone to look after you.

1057
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:26,400
- He's the executive and I'm...
- Now, don't be offended.

1058
01:08:26,401 --> 01:08:29,581
People can't tell on themselves.
That's the type you are.

1059
01:08:29,582 --> 01:08:31,202
Oh, for heaven's sake!

1060
01:08:31,303 --> 01:08:33,203
I don't like the executive type.

1061
01:08:33,204 --> 01:08:35,804
What you can see in
him is beyond me.

1062
01:08:37,205 --> 01:08:40,005
Well, he asked me to marry him

1063
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:41,800
during the clearance sale.

1064
01:08:41,801 --> 01:08:45,000
- Did you even consider it?
- To be honest, I did.

1065
01:08:45,001 --> 01:08:46,501
Well, why didn't you?

1066
01:08:46,502 --> 01:08:50,402
I didn't know whether I loved him. Maybe
I'd be marrying him for his money.

1067
01:08:50,403 --> 01:08:54,003
- Has he got money?
- Oh, he makes $55 a week.

1068
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,004
Fifty-five dollars?

1069
01:08:57,505 --> 01:09:00,605
I don't see how a woman can
marry a man with money.

1070
01:09:00,606 --> 01:09:06,806
She'd always feel that maybe... maybe
she'd married him not for what he was

1071
01:09:06,807 --> 01:09:08,807
but for what he has.

1072
01:09:08,808 --> 01:09:11,208
There'd always be that
doubt between them.

1073
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:15,009
- Oh, my...
- Don't you feel well?

1074
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,910
Elizabeth?

1075
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:19,711
I wonder if you'd care

1076
01:09:20,112 --> 01:09:21,712
for the real me.

1077
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,913
I think I know the real you.

1078
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:32,914
I may not be exactly as I
appear on the surface.

1079
01:09:34,315 --> 01:09:37,499
Well, no-one's really perfect.
I'm not.

1080
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,100
What do you mean,
on the surface?

1081
01:09:40,499 --> 01:09:43,001
- Are you married or something?
- No, no, no, no...

1082
01:09:43,002 --> 01:09:45,202
- Then what is it?
- Well, I, uh...

1083
01:09:46,903 --> 01:09:49,203
I've got a very weak stomach.

1084
01:09:50,804 --> 01:09:53,504
You put your stomach
in my hands.

1085
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:57,505
Oh, our station! Good night, Mary.
It was lovely.

1086
01:10:00,207 --> 01:10:01,907
See you tomorrow, Mary.
Good night.

1087
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,308
Hello.

1088
01:11:06,509 --> 01:11:07,909
Hello!

1089
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,900
Dorothy, I'm sorry to get
you out of bed so late

1090
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,501
but this is very...

1091
01:11:16,502 --> 01:11:18,102
This is very important.

1092
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:21,503
Do you still go with that fellow that
works in the personnel department?

1093
01:11:22,304 --> 01:11:24,004
Yes, I do.

1094
01:11:24,107 --> 01:11:28,640
Well, give me his telephone number.
I have to speak to him tonight.

1095
01:11:29,405 --> 01:11:31,005
It's for you, Sam.

1096
01:11:33,506 --> 01:11:34,506
Yeah?

1097
01:11:36,207 --> 01:11:38,707
Uh, Sam, Sam, listen...

1098
01:11:38,708 --> 01:11:42,308
We're in terrible trouble. Meet me at
the employees' entrance right now?

1099
01:11:42,499 --> 01:11:43,809
Now?

1100
01:11:45,110 --> 01:11:46,910
You mean this late?

1101
01:11:46,911 --> 01:11:48,311
Yes, now!

1102
01:12:30,313 --> 01:12:32,513
As long as there's a
chance we can win

1103
01:12:33,514 --> 01:12:34,914
I'm going to stick.

1104
01:12:35,815 --> 01:12:37,115
Yes, dear.

1105
01:12:40,116 --> 01:12:41,916
They locked me out of my room.

1106
01:12:44,117 --> 01:12:45,717
Can I sleep on your roof?

1107
01:12:46,618 --> 01:12:48,118
Yes, dear.

1108
01:12:51,219 --> 01:12:53,019
What's the matter
with you, honey?

1109
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:54,620
Mary!

1110
01:12:55,421 --> 01:12:57,021
Mary, I'm back.

1111
01:12:58,499 --> 01:13:00,022
Don't take it so hard.

1112
01:13:00,023 --> 01:13:01,823
I'm going to stay here.

1113
01:13:03,724 --> 01:13:05,200
Yes, dear.

1114
01:13:14,801 --> 01:13:16,301
Good night, Joe.

1115
01:13:16,302 --> 01:13:17,499
Good night, honey.

1116
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:21,700
I won't see you for breakfast.
I'm starting out real early.

1117
01:13:21,701 --> 01:13:27,301
- Well, you can have breakfast.
- Mh-hm. Good night.

1118
01:13:37,102 --> 01:13:39,402
Remember the list
with the 400 names?

1119
01:13:39,903 --> 01:13:41,103
Mh-hm.

1120
01:13:41,104 --> 01:13:43,604
Where do you think it is?

1121
01:13:43,605 --> 01:13:45,905
Down on the sand at Coney.

1122
01:13:46,506 --> 01:13:50,500
It's in Higgins' pocket. And
he's a spy for the store.

1123
01:13:51,901 --> 01:13:52,901
What?

1124
01:13:53,902 --> 01:13:55,700
Who? Who? Higgins?

1125
01:13:55,701 --> 01:13:57,700
And there's no mistake.

1126
01:13:57,701 --> 01:14:00,501
And he's got all those names?

1127
01:14:00,502 --> 01:14:02,602
All those poor people.

1128
01:14:03,603 --> 01:14:05,400
And it's my fault.

1129
01:14:05,401 --> 01:14:08,501
Where does he live? I'll get
that list back tonight.

1130
01:14:08,702 --> 01:14:10,002
I don't know.

1131
01:14:19,904 --> 01:14:24,304
Tomorrow. You get him in
the stock room. I'll get that list.

1132
01:14:24,505 --> 01:14:26,905
How are you going to
get in the store?

1133
01:14:26,906 --> 01:14:30,106
Don't worry how I get in the store.
You get him in the stockroom, see?

1134
01:14:30,107 --> 01:14:31,707
And I'll join you.

1135
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:34,308
And I'll get that list if I have
to hit him over the head.

1136
01:14:50,109 --> 01:14:51,809
Will you please sign, Mr. Hooper?

1137
01:14:56,210 --> 01:14:59,210
Our friend Higgins seems to be
a little late this morning.

1138
01:14:59,211 --> 01:15:01,311
Probably drinking last night.

1139
01:15:01,312 --> 01:15:03,012
Oh, he only had three beers.

1140
01:15:03,913 --> 01:15:06,813
- You were with him yesterday?
- I... We...

1141
01:15:06,814 --> 01:15:08,714
Mary and Joe

1142
01:15:08,715 --> 01:15:10,615
No, just Tom and I.

1143
01:15:10,616 --> 01:15:12,716
Mr. Higgins and I went to the beach.

1144
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,717
He asked me before
you did, really.

1145
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:16,718
That's perfectly all right.

1146
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:20,619
- Ah, who have we here?
- Good morning, Elizabeth.

1147
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:23,820
Good morning, Mr. Higgins. Tom.

1148
01:15:23,821 --> 01:15:27,621
- We're a little late this morning, aren't we?
- Oh, did you come late, too?

1149
01:15:27,622 --> 01:15:29,822
You are a little
late this morning.

1150
01:15:29,823 --> 01:15:32,323
- Yes, I am.
- And why, may I ask?

1151
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:34,924
Because I overslept.
I was tired.

1152
01:15:34,925 --> 01:15:38,125
- Well, that's a novel excuse.
- Well, it's true.

1153
01:15:38,126 --> 01:15:40,726
- I don't like your tone of voice.
- I don't like yours, either.

1154
01:15:40,727 --> 01:15:42,127
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1155
01:15:42,128 --> 01:15:45,128
Just another employee
in the store. That's all.

1156
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:46,929
And a darn poor one at that.

1157
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:49,430
Do you know what's going to happen
to you? You're going to be fired.

1158
01:15:49,431 --> 01:15:50,931
- I'm going to be fired?
- Yes.

1159
01:15:50,932 --> 01:15:54,632
Let me tell you something. You're going
to be fired. How do you like that?

1160
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:00,400
Five pairs of these high-tops
come back in the exchange.

1161
01:16:00,401 --> 01:16:02,201
Ha! Give me my 10 dollars.

1162
01:16:02,202 --> 01:16:04,702
- Bring them in here.
- Hey, where's my money?

1163
01:16:08,703 --> 01:16:10,703
- You shouldn't have done that, Tom.
- Why not?

1164
01:16:10,704 --> 01:16:12,604
I'm entitled to common courtesy.

1165
01:16:12,605 --> 01:16:15,005
- It doesn't work that way.
- The trouble with you people is

1166
01:16:15,006 --> 01:16:17,400
you have no faith in employers.

1167
01:16:18,501 --> 01:16:20,801
Well, where's my sales book?

1168
01:16:24,502 --> 01:16:25,802
I'm worried about him.

1169
01:16:27,403 --> 01:16:31,903
Elizabeth, you know, you've...
you've lead a very sheltered life.

1170
01:16:31,904 --> 01:16:36,404
Now, men aren't exactly
what they seem to be.

1171
01:16:36,405 --> 01:16:38,400
Some men are wonderful.

1172
01:16:38,401 --> 01:16:41,451
Other men are beasts, like...

1173
01:16:42,152 --> 01:16:44,652
Well, like other men.

1174
01:16:44,653 --> 01:16:48,353
Oh, honey. Joe will come back.

1175
01:16:48,954 --> 01:16:50,154
It isn't Joe.

1176
01:16:51,355 --> 01:16:54,155
I'm talking about a
particular party.

1177
01:16:54,156 --> 01:16:57,556
Who thinks nothing of toying
with the heart of a good woman.

1178
01:16:57,557 --> 01:16:59,357
How'd you like what
I said to Hooper?

1179
01:16:59,358 --> 01:17:01,778
You were very brave
but foolhardy.

1180
01:17:01,779 --> 01:17:05,509
Mr. Higgins, would you be kind enough
to assist me in the stockroom?

1181
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:08,400
- Is it necessary?
- Most necessary.

1182
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,701
Well, what happens?

1183
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:24,602
Uh... there's been a lot
of trouble in here.

1184
01:17:25,903 --> 01:17:31,703
Uh... there should be a right shoe and a
left shoe in every one of these boxes

1185
01:17:31,704 --> 01:17:34,904
and lately, there's been a
right shoe with a right shoe

1186
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:37,205
when there ought to be a
right shoe with a left shoe.

1187
01:17:37,206 --> 01:17:38,406
What's that again?

1188
01:17:38,407 --> 01:17:42,907
Uh, look, you just open every box
and see that there's a right shoe

1189
01:17:42,908 --> 01:17:44,508
and a left shoe in it.
I'll be right back.

1190
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:43,709
Mr. Higgins!

1191
01:19:46,710 --> 01:19:48,110
Mr. Higgins.

1192
01:19:49,611 --> 01:19:50,611
Tom!

1193
01:19:50,612 --> 01:19:51,612
Tom!

1194
01:19:52,713 --> 01:19:55,713
Tom! Tom, say something.

1195
01:19:55,714 --> 01:19:58,314
Say something. Oh dear.

1196
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:00,615
- Is this Higgins?
- Yes.

1197
01:20:00,616 --> 01:20:02,616
- Are you Jones?
- Yes.

1198
01:20:02,617 --> 01:20:05,117
- He's drunk.
- He is not!

1199
01:20:05,118 --> 01:20:08,318
Come on, you two. The General
Manager wants to see you. Up.

1200
01:20:08,499 --> 01:20:09,919
Where am I?

1201
01:20:11,020 --> 01:20:13,720
- Where are you taking me?
- To the General Manager's office.

1202
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:16,500
Is that how he makes people
go to his office? Oh!

1203
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:20,301
You must feel pretty good,
Mr. Higgins.

1204
01:20:20,302 --> 01:20:23,902
You'll probably get a raise after
they fire all of these poor people.

1205
01:20:23,903 --> 01:20:27,103
You Benedict Arnold
in sheep's clothing.

1206
01:20:27,204 --> 01:20:29,704
I'll show you who's a Benedict
Arnold in sheep's clothing!

1207
01:20:29,705 --> 01:20:30,905
You watch!

1208
01:20:38,806 --> 01:20:41,106
Is this the way you discharge
your responsibility?

1209
01:20:41,107 --> 01:20:44,107
Can't you understand that dealing
with people the way you do

1210
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,966
is the reason for this
civil war around here?

1211
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,508
I've worked with these people.
They have rights.

1212
01:20:48,509 --> 01:20:52,009
What do you suggest? I suggest
that you get a different job

1213
01:20:52,010 --> 01:20:56,100
if you can't get the confidence of your
employees. You bumble-witted idiot!

1214
01:20:56,101 --> 01:21:00,501
Tom... Tom, this is wonderful
what you're doing.

1215
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:03,852
And you'll never regret it.
Let them fire you.

1216
01:21:03,853 --> 01:21:06,700
As long as there's a breath in my
body you'll never go hungry.

1217
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:11,801
Calling me names
isn't the solution.

1218
01:21:11,802 --> 01:21:15,400
I'd like nothing better than to get
the confidence of my employees.

1219
01:21:15,401 --> 01:21:19,001
But who can I talk to? Who
represents enough of these people?

1220
01:21:23,502 --> 01:21:26,302
Would you consider 400 enough?

1221
01:21:26,303 --> 01:21:28,003
Yes, I would.

1222
01:21:29,604 --> 01:21:31,104
There's our representative.

1223
01:21:31,105 --> 01:21:33,005
Where are your 400 names?

1224
01:21:34,506 --> 01:21:37,606
There's the catch.
He wants the names.

1225
01:21:37,607 --> 01:21:40,300
See? My hands are tied.

1226
01:21:42,001 --> 01:21:45,501
- This isn't a trick, is it?
- Do I look like I'm lying to you?

1227
01:21:45,502 --> 01:21:48,502
- No. You don't.
- Mary, you can't.

1228
01:21:48,503 --> 01:21:51,303
If there's a right way, this is it.
We're not being fair to him.

1229
01:21:51,304 --> 01:21:53,494
If we want him to trust
us, we gotta trust him.

1230
01:21:54,595 --> 01:21:56,405
Well, I'm against it.

1231
01:21:59,406 --> 01:22:01,306
I'm taking a big
chance too, Joe.

1232
01:22:01,407 --> 01:22:04,607
I... If this doesn't go, I lose you.

1233
01:22:07,508 --> 01:22:08,908
All right, honey.

1234
01:22:13,709 --> 01:22:17,209
Well, Tom, have you got the list you
picked up on the beach last night?

1235
01:22:17,210 --> 01:22:21,410
- Yes, I have.
- Give it to Mr. Allison, please.

1236
01:22:27,511 --> 01:22:30,611
It's going to be terrible if you
fool these two young people.

1237
01:22:31,412 --> 01:22:35,400
You old fool. How dare you come into
my office and talk to me like you did?

1238
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:40,501
I can outwit morons like you every day
of the week and twice on Sundays.

1239
01:22:40,502 --> 01:22:44,502
Which is why I sit behind the desk
while you stand in front of it.

1240
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:46,003
Why, you!

1241
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,004
Hooper, get that paper!

1242
01:22:49,005 --> 01:22:50,905
Keep your hands off of her!

1243
01:22:52,106 --> 01:22:54,006
- Harley, McGinnis, come in!
- Ahh!

1244
01:22:56,607 --> 01:23:00,107
You idiots! Both of
you, I discharge you!

1245
01:23:01,508 --> 01:23:03,108
Eat it! Eat it!

1246
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:04,509
Give me that paper!
Give me that!

1247
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:07,710
Stop it! Stop it, I
say, you idiots!

1248
01:23:08,111 --> 01:23:09,111
Stop it! Oh!

1249
01:23:12,712 --> 01:23:14,512
Stop it! Stop it, I say!

1250
01:23:15,713 --> 01:23:17,713
Why, you mashing brute!

1251
01:23:18,514 --> 01:23:19,714
Give me that paper!

1252
01:23:22,715 --> 01:23:24,715
Stop it, I say!

1253
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:28,516
How dare you?
I'll have you discharged!

1254
01:23:28,517 --> 01:23:29,717
Every one of you!

1255
01:23:31,318 --> 01:23:35,218
Now, you simpleton. I'll
show you who can outwit who.

1256
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,219
Who're you going to fire now?

1257
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,220
You give me the name of
everybody on that list

1258
01:23:39,317 --> 01:23:42,084
or I'll fire the entire
5th floor for starter.

1259
01:23:43,221 --> 01:23:47,251
That's not fair. Many people on the
5th floor know nothing about this.

1260
01:23:47,252 --> 01:23:49,402
Every name or else they all go.
Every one of them.

1261
01:23:53,703 --> 01:23:55,400
Get out of my way!

1262
01:23:55,901 --> 01:23:59,101
Discharge slips. For
everyone on the 5th floor.

1263
01:23:59,102 --> 01:24:00,902
- Yes, sir.
- How dare you? What do you mean?!

1264
01:24:00,903 --> 01:24:02,303
- Hold that door! Get it open!
- Help me, Tom!

1265
01:24:07,004 --> 01:24:08,704
Stop that! Take it out!

1266
01:24:08,705 --> 01:24:11,905
Employees! Listen
to me, everybody!

1267
01:24:11,906 --> 01:24:16,106
Come out to Bryant Park!
Don't be afraid! Everybody together!

1268
01:24:16,107 --> 01:24:20,607
If we all walk out now, we got 'em licked!
Come out to Bryant Park.

1269
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,908
Drop what you're doing and
come out to Bryant Park!

1270
01:24:23,909 --> 01:24:26,109
If we all get together now,
they can't stop us!

1271
01:24:26,110 --> 01:24:28,810
Here we go! Everybody out!

1272
01:24:28,811 --> 01:24:32,211
Leave what you're doing!
Don't just stand there!

1273
01:24:32,212 --> 01:24:35,212
Move! Go on, walk!
Everybody together!

1274
01:24:35,213 --> 01:24:37,913
Come out to Bryant
Park, don't be afraid!

1275
01:24:37,914 --> 01:24:40,914
If we all walk out at once,
we got 'em licked!

1276
01:24:40,915 --> 01:24:43,015
Come out to Bryant Park!

1277
01:25:15,816 --> 01:25:17,916
Shhh! Picket...
Picketing your house.

1278
01:25:23,917 --> 01:25:26,717
George. I'm worried.

1279
01:25:27,418 --> 01:25:29,518
Elizabeth won't marry me.

1280
01:25:29,519 --> 01:25:31,119
A man with money.

1281
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,620
Maybe, in your case,
she will make an exception.

1282
01:25:34,621 --> 01:25:36,221
- Do you think so?
- Maybe.

1283
01:25:36,722 --> 01:25:38,322
- No.
- No.

1284
01:25:38,323 --> 01:25:40,900
No, it's against her principles.

1285
01:25:42,301 --> 01:25:44,401
She'll have to know sometime.

1286
01:25:46,202 --> 01:25:47,502
Right now!

1287
01:25:52,903 --> 01:25:56,103
- Don't get excited, J.P.
- We'll call the police.

1288
01:25:56,104 --> 01:25:57,904
Nobody's going to call anybody.

1289
01:25:59,005 --> 01:26:02,105
I'm going to send for the ringleaders
and have it out right now.

1290
01:26:02,106 --> 01:26:04,406
- You wait in there.
- Excellent idea. We'll handle them.

1291
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:13,607
- How do I get out the back way?
- This way, sir.

1292
01:26:14,108 --> 01:26:15,708
Get my hat.

1293
01:26:20,809 --> 01:26:23,000
Tommy, you son-of-a-gun!

1294
01:26:24,001 --> 01:26:25,401
There he is!

1295
01:26:29,702 --> 01:26:31,102
Tom, where have you been?

1296
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:33,503
Mary! Here he is!

1297
01:26:46,204 --> 01:26:48,104
We got a surprise for you.

1298
01:26:48,105 --> 01:26:50,105
- You've got a surprise for me?
- Yup, look.

1299
01:26:53,906 --> 01:26:58,606
We decided that nobody was to have
the honor of carrying this but you.

1300
01:27:01,507 --> 01:27:03,907
- Come on, folks, we have to keep moving.
- Wait!

1301
01:27:05,608 --> 01:27:08,008
They're waiting inside there
to meet with us.

1302
01:27:08,009 --> 01:27:09,209
What?!

1303
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:11,810
Tom, how did you arrange it?

1304
01:27:11,811 --> 01:27:13,411
It wasn't hard.

1305
01:27:13,412 --> 01:27:15,602
Oh, Tom, that's wonderful!

1306
01:27:15,603 --> 01:27:18,103
Come on, in we go!
This is it, folks!

1307
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:32,804
Get rid of that old fool.

1308
01:27:34,055 --> 01:27:35,005
Elizabeth!

1309
01:27:35,006 --> 01:27:37,406
You do like me, don't you?

1310
01:27:37,407 --> 01:27:39,307
Of course I do, Tom.

1311
01:27:40,608 --> 01:27:42,408
Just the way you are.

1312
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:45,509
Oh, my.

1313
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:10,710
You sit here.

1314
01:28:15,411 --> 01:28:17,611
Well, let's begin.

1315
01:28:17,812 --> 01:28:19,399
That's right, let's begin.

1316
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:21,600
- Suits me.
- We're ready.

1317
01:28:21,601 --> 01:28:24,900
You know you're not in a very
good bargaining position.

1318
01:28:24,901 --> 01:28:27,100
Maybe not, but the
store's closed.

1319
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:29,501
We can open it again!
And very easily!

1320
01:28:29,502 --> 01:28:31,402
Let's not raise our voices.

1321
01:28:31,403 --> 01:28:35,103
Yeah, that's right.
Let's not raise our voices.

1322
01:28:36,804 --> 01:28:39,399
Uh, I don't know very
much about business, but

1323
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:43,200
from a woman's viewpoint, there
are moral issues involved here.

1324
01:28:43,201 --> 01:28:45,201
Miss, we are not concerned
with moral issues.

1325
01:28:45,202 --> 01:28:47,332
- Why aren't we?
- Because we aren't!

1326
01:28:47,333 --> 01:28:49,533
Moral issues are
pretty important.

1327
01:28:49,534 --> 01:28:53,300
Oh. I see your point of view.

1328
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,901
Uh, could I have a word?

1329
01:29:03,702 --> 01:29:04,899
This may sound foolish, but

1330
01:29:04,950 --> 01:29:09,750
in my opinion, one of the things that
ought to be corrected in this store is

1331
01:29:10,603 --> 01:29:11,703
Go on!

1332
01:29:11,704 --> 01:29:15,704
Well, there ought to be somebody in
the store's pet shop on Sunday.

1333
01:29:15,705 --> 01:29:18,205
All those canaries there
without water the whole day.

1334
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:18,919
Canaries?

1335
01:29:19,006 --> 01:29:21,006
That's the most idiotic
thing I've ever heard!

1336
01:29:21,007 --> 01:29:24,707
Talking about canaries at a time
like this! That's purely idiotic!

1337
01:29:25,508 --> 01:29:27,308
There's nothing
idiotic about it!

1338
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,400
Certainly! There's nothing
idiotic about it!

1339
01:29:30,401 --> 01:29:33,901
- There are moral issues involved.
- How can you say a thing like that?

1340
01:29:35,102 --> 01:29:36,402
Excuse me.

1341
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,803
Madam, have you gone mad?

1342
01:29:41,804 --> 01:29:44,704
- Get your hands off him!
- Let go of Mr. Merrick!

1343
01:29:44,705 --> 01:29:46,005
Let go of Mr. Higgins!

1344
01:29:46,006 --> 01:29:47,806
- Are you hurt, Mr. Merrick?
- Are you all right, Mr. Merrick?

1345
01:29:47,807 --> 01:29:49,607
- Are you hurt, Mr. Merrick?
- Are you all right, Mr. Merrick?

1346
01:29:49,608 --> 01:29:52,108
- Are you hurt, Mr. Merrick?
- Are you all right, Mr. Merrick?

1347
01:29:55,009 --> 01:29:57,309
Elizabeth, money isn't everything.

1348
01:29:57,610 --> 01:29:59,410
You could learn to love me.

1349
01:29:59,411 --> 01:30:02,211
Mary, you see my side of it.
Say something!

1350
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:05,512
Joe!

1351
01:30:21,913 --> 01:30:23,813
Hey, that's my wife
you've got there.

1352
01:30:23,814 --> 01:30:25,414
This one's yours.

1353
01:30:25,415 --> 01:30:26,715
Ignore him.

1354
01:30:27,716 --> 01:30:29,616
We're having a swell time,
Mr. Merrick.

1355
01:30:29,617 --> 01:30:32,200
Glad you are, Mr... Mr. Feldspar.

1356
01:30:33,401 --> 01:30:34,901
Men's Clothing, 3rd floor.

1357
01:30:34,902 --> 01:30:36,502
Lovely dress, Mary.

1358
01:30:36,503 --> 01:30:39,603
Our debutante model, $27.75.

1359
01:30:39,604 --> 01:30:43,404
You remember Mrs. Craig, Lingerie, 5th
floor? Mr. Martin, Hardware, basement?

1360
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:45,005
- Mr. Merrick.
- How do you do?

1361
01:30:45,006 --> 01:30:47,706
Do you remember everybody's
name in the store?

1362
01:30:47,719 --> 01:30:48,852
Almost everybody.

1363
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,807
- Oh, aren't they having a wonderful time?
- Yeah.

1364
01:30:54,608 --> 01:30:56,908
- He's all right!
- Who's all right?

1365
01:30:56,909 --> 01:30:58,809
Merrick's all right!

1366
01:31:06,202 --> 01:31:07,602
Gee, this is wonderful!

1367
01:31:07,603 --> 01:31:09,703
I can't believe we're
really going to Honolulu.

1368
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:14,591
