1957 - COLD WAR
INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS

3
00:03:44,656 --> 00:03:46,359
<i>The next stop is Broad Street.</i>

4
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:48,391
<i>Broad Street will be next.</i>

5
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,432
Upstairs. This way.

6
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:11,610
He did not come up this way.
Anything.

7
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,644
He is not up here.
Go back down.

8
00:05:15,848 --> 00:05:17,848
Excuse me.

9
00:05:36,601 --> 00:05:38,670
Go ahead and park
around the corner.

10
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:53,665
Visitors.

11
00:08:53,698 --> 00:08:55,067
Do you mind if I
fetch my teeth?

12
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
Colonel, would you
turn around, please?

13
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:01,139
Sit down on the bed.

14
00:09:01,173 --> 00:09:03,173
Let us go.

15
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,985
They are in the... The teeth
are in the on the sink.

16
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:15,855
Look at me. We are agents...

17
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,990
from the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

18
00:09:18,024 --> 00:09:19,091
Look at me!

19
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,893
I am talking to you.

20
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:22,727
We have received
information...

21
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:25,030
concerning your
involvement in espionage.

22
00:09:25,063 --> 00:09:27,066
You can either cooperate
with us right now,

23
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,701
or, you will be under arrest.

24
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:29,668
Do you understand, Colonel?

25
00:09:29,701 --> 00:09:31,636
No, not really.

26
00:09:31,671 --> 00:09:34,974
Why do you keep
calling me "Colonel"?

27
00:09:35,006 --> 00:09:36,775
You need to get dressed.

28
00:09:36,808 --> 00:09:38,844
We have to search
your apartment.

29
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,948
Would you mind if I
cleaned my palette?

30
00:09:42,981 --> 00:09:45,784
The paints, it will
be ruined otherwise.

31
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,817
It is just behind you there.

32
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:51,123
I have a cloth myself.

33
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,224
Thank you.

34
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,994
Start searching the place. Thank you.

35
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,162
All right! Search
the mattress,

36
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,429
the bed, the floorboards, his chair.

37
00:09:57,462 --> 00:09:59,731
Would you put that in the ashtray?
On the window still there.

38
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:01,764
Take a good look at that desk.

39
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,104
Let us see the desk.

40
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,312
Would you not want
to get this ruined?

41
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,697
<i>Do not you say "my guy."</i>

42
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,734
<i>He is not "my guy."</i>

43
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:37,802
<I>Yes, he is "your guy."
Who about are we talking?</I>

44
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:41,774
We are talking about a person
whom did my client?

45
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,807
So, do not make him "my guy."

46
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:46,312
<I>Okay, fine.</I>

47
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,914
<I>My point is, the person
insured by your client,</I>

48
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:52,717
<I>He does not deny that any
of these things happened.</I>

49
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:55,287
"These... These things"?

50
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,956
<I>Yes, these five things.</I>

51
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,759
Wait, hold it, and hold
it, and hold it.

52
00:10:59,792 --> 00:11:01,059
Not five things.

53
00:11:01,092 --> 00:11:03,062
One thing.

54
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:04,196
<I>Clearly, it is five things.</I>

55
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,965
Well, I am sorry, It
is not clear to me.

56
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,801
Five things? Explain it to me.

57
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,068
<I>It is self-evident.</I>

58
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:11,971
Okay, and then tell
me what happened.

59
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,341
Tell me the story in a way that
makes sense for five things.

60
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:17,777
Fine, absolutely.
Your person is...

61
00:11:17,809 --> 00:11:19,144
Not my person. Insured
by my client.

62
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,812
The person insured
by your client...

63
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,313
is driving down
State Highway 19.

64
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,950
When he loses control of his
car and hits my five guys.

65
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:27,086
The five people who hired me
to represent them.

66
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:28,553
Because you are not
honoring your claim.

67
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:32,290
You mean my client is not honoring
the claim, the insurance company?

68
00:11:32,323 --> 00:11:34,960
Mr. Donovan, we are all
clear who is who, here?

69
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,797
Except my client
honors every claim.

70
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,931
They do, Mr. Bates.

71
00:11:38,963 --> 00:11:40,298
Every single legitimate claim,

72
00:11:40,331 --> 00:11:41,966
up to the limit of
their liability.

73
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,135
Which is $100,000
per accident?

74
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:46,304
In the case of
this man's policy.

75
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:47,505
And, this is one claim.

76
00:11:47,539 --> 00:11:51,243
According to your description:
"He hit my five guys."

77
00:11:51,277 --> 00:11:54,279
The person insured by my
client had one accident.

78
00:11:54,312 --> 00:11:55,548
One, one, one.

79
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:59,118
Losing control of the car and
hitting five motorcyclists.

80
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,352
From their point of view,
five things happened.

81
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,224
Look, Bob. May I Bob?

82
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,326
"Jim."

83
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,129
If I go, bowling and I throw a
strike, one thing happened.

84
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:12,230
Ten things did not happen.

85
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:14,299
Jim, my people are
not bowling pins.

86
00:12:14,332 --> 00:12:16,034
As much as your person may
have treated them as such.

87
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:17,369
If... Let me finish.
Let me finish.

88
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:20,206
If your house is
insured for $100,000.

89
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,240
And, a tornado
carries it away,

90
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:23,942
it carried away one house.

91
00:12:23,975 --> 00:12:25,411
It did not pick up every
stick of furniture.

92
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:28,114
And, destroy it in a
separate incident.

93
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:30,883
If that is what,
you are saying,

94
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,153
Then, there is never any
limit to our liability.

95
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,188
That is the end of the
insurance business.

96
00:12:37,222 --> 00:12:39,390
Then, Bob nobody is safe.

97
00:12:45,096 --> 00:12:47,298
Waters, Cowan and Donovan.
How may I direct your call?

98
00:12:47,332 --> 00:12:48,967
Good morning, Mr. Donovan!

99
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,302
Good morning, Alison!

100
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,270
I moved your 9:00 a.m.
with Prudential, Sir.

101
00:12:52,303 --> 00:12:53,404
Why did you do that?

102
00:12:53,438 --> 00:12:55,438
I asked to her do.

103
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,275
Is everything all right, Tom?

104
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,979
Why do not you leave your stuff
with Alison, and come on inside?

105
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,413
Something important
has come up.

106
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:04,182
Somebody is here to see us.

107
00:13:04,216 --> 00:13:06,051
Natalie is getting
your coffee.

108
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:08,854
Nescafe, cream, two lumps.
Right?

109
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:10,888
That is right. Thanks.

110
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:13,424
- Lynn!
- Jim!

111
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,326
Nice to see you again.
How is the family?

112
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,163
Great, good. Thanks.
How is Annie?

113
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,431
Homicide. We had the
in-laws for the holiday.

114
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,784
If she acts on it, she will
have good representation.

115
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Now, what is up?

116
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,378
Okay, here is the thing.

117
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,914
The Soviet spy who caught,
we want you to defend him.

118
00:13:35,947 --> 00:13:37,947
Here is the indictment.

119
00:13:40,418 --> 00:13:42,418
Wow!

120
00:13:43,288 --> 00:13:45,157
I am not sure. I want
to pick that up.

121
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,225
The accused does not
know any lawyers.

122
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,259
The federal court
tossed it into our lap.

123
00:13:50,495 --> 00:13:52,431
The Bar Committee took a vote.

124
00:13:52,463 --> 00:13:54,265
You are the unanimous choice.

125
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:55,900
It is important to us.

126
00:13:55,934 --> 00:13:57,235
It is important to
our country, Jim.

127
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:59,205
That this man is
getting a fair chance.

128
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,240
American justice
will be on trial.

129
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,174
Of course! When you
put it that way.

130
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,177
It is an honor asked.

131
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,111
But, Lynn, I am an
insurances lawyer.

132
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:09,081
I have not done
criminal work in years.

133
00:14:09,114 --> 00:14:11,115
It is like riding a bike.
Is not it?

134
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,219
You distinguished
yourself at Nuremberg.

135
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:14,953
I was on the prosecution team.

136
00:14:14,986 --> 00:14:16,221
Not the point.

137
00:14:16,254 --> 00:14:18,254
You are no stranger
to criminal law.

138
00:14:18,356 --> 00:14:20,292
Jim, look at the situation.

139
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,360
The man reviled publicly.

140
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,394
And, I will be, too.

141
00:14:23,428 --> 00:14:25,264
Yes, in quarters that
is more ignorant.

142
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,131
That is exactly why
this has done,

143
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:29,235
and, capably done.

144
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,236
It cannot look like
our justice system,

145
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,269
tosses people on the ash heap.

146
00:14:37,976 --> 00:14:40,245
Suppose I will do. As the
evidence, looks like.

147
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,014
Very overwhelming.

148
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:45,517
Great. Great.

149
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:48,187
Everyone will hate me but
at least I will lose.

150
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,423
What do you think, Tom?

151
00:14:52,457 --> 00:14:55,126
The firm will suffer.
I have work here.

152
00:14:55,159 --> 00:14:57,196
I think it is a
patriotic duty.

153
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,197
It is an important mission.

154
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:01,432
I told Lynn, the firm
could not say no.

155
00:15:01,466 --> 00:15:03,534
You would have a tough
time saying no, too.

156
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:08,006
I think you have to defend
the son of a bitch.

157
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:10,042
You are doing it.

158
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,409
What are you doing?

159
00:15:11,442 --> 00:15:14,446
Defending Abel,
the Soviet spy.

160
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,780
I may. I have to speak to...

161
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:18,450
Wait! How do you know? Did they
post it on the bulletin board?

162
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:20,552
No, I... I was talking
to Richard Earl.

163
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,586
Look, if I do this, I am
going to need your help.

164
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:28,057
Can you work tonight?

165
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:31,161
I have a dinner date, Sir.

166
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,620
It is Tuesday, right. Yeah, no,
I am free, completely free.

167
00:15:36,934 --> 00:15:38,934
Thank you, Sir.

168
00:15:41,472 --> 00:15:43,308
<i>It is also an honor.</i>

169
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,443
And, the Bar Association
asked me...

170
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:47,245
because they want to
show that even a spy,

171
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,048
gets a capable advocate.

172
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:51,216
Maybe it is the kind of
honor without we could do.

173
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
Honey, what are you
doing in home?

174
00:15:54,052 --> 00:15:56,052
I have stood up.

175
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,557
That is despicable.

176
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,158
Who is this knot-head?

177
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,360
I would rather not to say.

178
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,528
<I>Sit down. We just started.</I>

179
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:04,730
People are scared.

180
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,597
<I>They are building bomb shelters
to protect themselves.</I>

181
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:09,033
<I>- From people like this man.
- Ok.</I>

182
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,235
<i>I go to the store,</i>

183
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:13,572
<I>people are buying canned
food and Potassium tablets.</i>

184
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:16,408
It is all about this man,
and what represents.

185
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,509
He is a threat to all of us.
A traitor.

186
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,346
- Who is a traitor?
- The Rosenberg was traitor.

187
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,279
Who were they?

188
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,381
They gave atomic secrets
to the Russians.

189
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:25,384
They were Americans.
They betrayed their country.

190
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,485
You cannot accuse Abel
of being a traitor.

191
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,053
He is not an American.

192
00:16:29,087 --> 00:16:30,456
Listen to yourself.

193
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,124
You are defending him already.

194
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:33,192
You are rehearsing it on me.

195
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:35,226
You said you were just
thinking about taking it.

196
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:38,129
I am just thinking about
it, just very hard.

197
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:41,100
Everyone deserves a defense.
Every person matters.

198
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,433
Jim, what do we deserve?

199
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,403
Do you know how people
will look at us?

200
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:46,605
Family man is trying
to free a traitor.

201
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,539
He is not a traitor, Mary.
Yes, yes.

202
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:50,109
Roger, get that! He
is not a traitor.

203
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:51,376
Why do I have to
do all the work?

204
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:53,211
- You wait until us say grace.
- I am hungry!

205
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:54,613
He is about the most unpopular
man in this country.

206
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:56,248
You are trying to take
the second place!

207
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,682
Yeah, and I am third.

208
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:59,684
- Carol, you are dating wrong person.
- I want eat.

209
00:16:59,717 --> 00:17:01,253
<i>Mary, do not make
this argument.</i>

210
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:02,287
<i>When we are not
having an argument.</i>

211
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:03,589
<i>You are against him.
I am for him.</i>

212
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:06,424
<i>No. I am not for him. I am not
for the Russians spying on us.</i>

213
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,428
<i>I am for his right to have a
defense in a court of law.</i>

214
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:11,462
<i>This is why they call
it a court of law.</i>

215
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,365
Sorry, Sir. I did not mean to
interrupt dinner.

216
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:14,599
A court of law... Hey, Doug.

217
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:19,304
No. Not at all. Hello, Doug.
Jim was just flailing.

218
00:17:19,337 --> 00:17:21,573
I am not flailing. Go ahead, Doug.
You can join us for dinner.

219
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:23,606
We are having
meatloaf tonight.

220
00:17:25,676 --> 00:17:28,212
You came over here to
help Jim think about...

221
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,448
Whether is he taking the case?

222
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,351
We are taking it! It is
exciting, is not it?

223
00:17:40,459 --> 00:17:42,193
Lord, we thank thee
for blessings.

224
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,628
We are about to receive.

225
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,198
Thy bounty through
Christ, our Lord. Amen.

226
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:55,740
Good morning, Sir. My
name is Jim Donovan.

227
00:17:55,773 --> 00:17:57,742
These are my credentials.

228
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:00,211
I am a partner in Waters,
Cowan and Donovan.

229
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:03,615
I had been admitted to the
New York Bar in 1941.

230
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:11,522
You had charged with 3
counts and 19 overt acts,

231
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:14,226
conspiracy to transmit
United States defense,

232
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,760
atomic secrets to
the Soviet Union.

233
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,528
Conspiracy to gather secrets.

234
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,698
And, failing to register
as a foreign agent.

235
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:27,739
Have many foreign
agents register?

236
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,247
If you do not mind
my asking, Sir.

237
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:39,484
Since your arrest.
Where have you been?

238
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:45,221
I could not say certainly.

239
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:48,825
You do not know.

240
00:18:49,528 --> 00:18:51,395
They drove me to an airport.

241
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:53,565
And, put me on a plane,
took me off the plane.

242
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:57,701
Somewhere hot.

243
00:18:58,436 --> 00:18:59,471
It is hot here.

244
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,441
Hotter, very humid.

245
00:19:02,473 --> 00:19:04,473
They put me in a room.

246
00:19:06,345 --> 00:19:08,345
You was beaten.

247
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,681
No.

248
00:19:09,714 --> 00:19:11,682
I talked.

249
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,785
Offers was made.

250
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:14,886
What do you mean?

251
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,423
Offers of employment, to
work for your government.

252
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:23,362
Told if I cooperated,

253
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,564
no further charges would
be made against me.

254
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:28,865
They would give me money.

255
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:32,868
And, you declined?

256
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,307
As you see.

257
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:38,710
Of course! I cannot
endorse that.

258
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,679
I feel duty-bound to urge you,

259
00:19:40,711 --> 00:19:42,814
to cooperate with the U.S.
government.

260
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:44,249
I said no.

261
00:19:44,282 --> 00:19:47,486
Perhaps you could relay to your
friends at the CIA that I meant it.

262
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,520
No, no, no. I am not.

263
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,555
I do not work for the agency.

264
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,460
I do not work for
the government.

265
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:58,730
I am here to offer my services
as your legal counsel.

266
00:19:58,763 --> 00:20:01,599
If you accept them as such,

267
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,768
I work for you.

268
00:20:04,903 --> 00:20:06,903
If I accept you.

269
00:20:13,478 --> 00:20:15,478
Are you good on what you do?

270
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:19,483
Yeah. Yeah, I am very good.

271
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,590
Have you represented
many accused spies?

272
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:30,527
No, not yet.

273
00:20:31,762 --> 00:20:34,398
This will be the
first for both.

274
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:39,935
Yes.

275
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,407
All right!

276
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,442
<i>"All right"? You accept.</i>

277
00:20:47,511 --> 00:20:48,846
Yes, all right!

278
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,383
Good, okay.

279
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,550
Let us start here.

280
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,719
If you are firm in
your resolve it,

281
00:20:53,751 --> 00:20:55,354
not to cooperate with the U.S.
government...

282
00:20:55,386 --> 00:20:56,488
I am.

283
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,923
Yeah.

284
00:20:57,955 --> 00:20:59,790
<i>Then do not talk to anybody
else about your case.</i>

285
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,526
Inside of government
or outside.

286
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,663
Except to me, to the
extent that you trust me.

287
00:21:04,695 --> 00:21:06,698
I have a mandate to serve you.
Nobody else does.

288
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,500
Frankly, everybody else
has an interest...

289
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:10,532
in sending you to
the electric chair.

290
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,669
All right!

291
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,440
You do not seem alarmed.

292
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Would it help?

293
00:21:33,858 --> 00:21:37,929
I would like
materials to draw.

294
00:21:37,962 --> 00:21:39,962
<i>That is not possible.</i>

295
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:42,401
A pencil, a piece of paper.

296
00:21:42,433 --> 00:21:44,433
Cigarettes.

297
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,971
Please?

298
00:21:55,012 --> 00:21:57,816
Mr. Donovan, you
is a man like me,

299
00:21:57,848 --> 00:22:00,419
doing the same for
your country.

300
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,888
If they were caught...

301
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:06,825
I am sure that you wish
them treated well.

302
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:12,763
<i>What is your name?</i>

303
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:14,798
Francis Gary Powers.

304
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,470
Rank, service?

305
00:22:18,502 --> 00:22:20,705
First Lieutenant, United
States Air Force.

306
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,476
Do you have any association?

307
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,510
With the Soviet Union,
Lieutenant Powers.

308
00:22:26,545 --> 00:22:27,746
Are you kidding?

309
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:28,946
Just answer the
questions, lieutenant.

310
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,549
Yes, no, or as
simply as you can.

311
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,751
Do you have any association
with the Soviet Union?

312
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,785
Hell, no.

313
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,055
Do you know why you are here?

314
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,794
Is that a no?

315
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:45,029
Yes. I mean...

316
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:46,932
No. It is just "no."

317
00:22:46,964 --> 00:22:49,500
Yes. I have absolutely
no idea why I am here.

318
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,701
Eyes front, Lieutenant.

319
00:22:50,736 --> 00:22:52,736
Yes, sir.

320
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,621
How would you do
in there, Gary?

321
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,594
Very good. I think. I
got my name right.

322
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:18,563
You probably outscored
Shin, then.

323
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,465
Who is winning?

324
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,733
That would be me.

325
00:23:22,768 --> 00:23:24,702
Well, deal me in.

326
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,938
<i>These are all mine, then.</i>

327
00:23:26,971 --> 00:23:28,971
<i>I told you boys not
to play with him.</i>

328
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:57,834
Okay, drivers.
Here is the deal.

329
00:23:59,136 --> 00:24:01,006
You selected for a mission.

330
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,574
Which you are not to discuss.

331
00:24:02,606 --> 00:24:04,875
With anyone outside
of this room.

332
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:06,644
No one.

333
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,712
I do not care who you trust.

334
00:24:08,747 --> 00:24:10,714
Wife, mother, sweetheart.

335
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,717
The good Lord when
you pray at night.

336
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,685
You do not tell any
of them anything.

337
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,719
Of what I am about
to tell you.

338
00:24:19,023 --> 00:24:21,990
Each of drivers has met
certain qualifications.

339
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,829
High-level security clearance.

340
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,631
<i>Exceptional pilot ratings...</i>

341
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:28,633
<i>in excess of the required
hour's flight time...</i>

342
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:30,602
<i>in a single-seat aircraft.</i>

343
00:24:30,634 --> 00:24:33,605
We are engaged in a war.

344
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:35,874
A war does in this moment,
not involve men-at-arms.

345
00:24:35,997 --> 00:24:37,776
It involves information.

346
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:40,010
You will be collecting
information.

347
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,881
You will be gathering
intelligence about the enemy.

348
00:24:42,913 --> 00:24:46,550
The intelligence you gather
could give us the upper hand...

349
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,990
in a full thermonuclear
exchange with the Soviet Union.

350
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:53,155
Or it could prevent one.

351
00:24:53,924 --> 00:24:56,126
<i>For public purposes,</i>

352
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,828
as far as your wife or mother.

353
00:24:57,962 --> 00:24:59,830
Or, sweetheart, the good Lord,

354
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,967
your mission does not exist.

355
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,836
If it does not exist.
You do not exist.

356
00:25:04,869 --> 00:25:08,272
You cannot be shot down.
You cannot be captured.

357
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:16,712
You work for the CIA now.

358
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,797
Jim, I heard your person is
speaking with a phony accent.

359
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:35,901
Does he keep this
up all the time?

360
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,670
Actually, I am sure that
is just the way he talks.

361
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:40,805
He has the Russian name.
However, a British passport.

362
00:25:40,838 --> 00:25:43,741
I doubt that is genuine.

363
00:25:43,775 --> 00:25:46,044
So, Jim, where are we?
I see here...

364
00:25:46,076 --> 00:25:48,680
Yes. Judge, you see...

365
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:53,084
I just do not think that three
weeks are going to do it.

366
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,086
We got a massive amount
of evidence, as you know.

367
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,186
Do you want to postpone?

368
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,388
Six weeks.

369
00:25:57,422 --> 00:26:00,892
I mean, there is just myself
and, my associate.

370
00:26:00,925 --> 00:26:02,126
Jim, is this serious?

371
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
Sir?

372
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:07,999
Is this serious?

373
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:09,667
Yes. Yes, indeed it is.

374
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:11,102
You can see in the file.

375
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:13,971
Jim, this man is a Soviet spy.

376
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,674
- Allegedly.
- Come on! Counselor!

377
00:26:18,242 --> 00:26:19,743
Your Honor.

378
00:26:19,978 --> 00:26:21,179
Of course, I salute you.

379
00:26:21,311 --> 00:26:23,748
We all salute you for
taking on a thankless task.

380
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:25,650
This man has due process.

381
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:27,884
Let us not kid each other.

382
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,989
<i>He will receive a
capable defense.</i>

383
00:26:31,021 --> 00:26:34,726
And, God willing.
He will be convicted.

384
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,126
Come on! Counselor.

385
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:37,695
Let us not play
games with this.

386
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,830
Not in my courtroom.

387
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,865
We have a date.

388
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,900
And, we are going to trial.

389
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,878
<i>Taxi!</i>

390
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,681
Taxi!

391
00:26:56,714 --> 00:26:59,683
I see your light on!
Son of a bitch!

392
00:27:01,051 --> 00:27:03,755
You cannot wait to get
back to Manhattan.

393
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,788
His light was on, right?

394
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,124
Son of a bitch!

395
00:27:54,972 --> 00:27:56,807
Against their
level of comfort.

396
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,909
The statute has not changed.

397
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,344
Excuse me, Sir.

398
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:01,376
Pardon me. Sorry.

399
00:28:32,376 --> 00:28:34,376
Mr. Donovan?

400
00:28:37,181 --> 00:28:39,181
What?

401
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:44,385
What?

402
00:28:55,299 --> 00:28:57,268
CIA.

403
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:58,301
Yeah.

404
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,203
I just wanted to chat.

405
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:06,176
How is the case going?

406
00:29:06,211 --> 00:29:08,980
The case is going great,
could not be better.

407
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:12,981
Has your person talked?

408
00:29:16,453 --> 00:29:19,089
Excuse me.

409
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,859
You met him. Has he talked?
Has he said anything yet?

410
00:29:24,128 --> 00:29:25,963
We are not having
this conversation.

411
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,098
No. Of course not.

412
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:30,300
No. I mean. We really
are not having it.

413
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,038
You are asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

414
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:35,339
Come on! Counselor.

415
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:36,340
You know, I wish
people like you.

416
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:37,442
Would stop saying: "Come on!
Counselor."

417
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,344
I did not like it the first
time it happened today.

418
00:29:39,376 --> 00:29:41,179
A judge said it to me twice.

419
00:29:41,211 --> 00:29:43,213
And, more I hear it,
more I do not like it.

420
00:29:46,483 --> 00:29:49,086
Ok. Listen. I understand
attorney-client privilege.

421
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,323
I understand all the
legal competitiveness.

422
00:29:52,356 --> 00:29:55,058
I understand that is
how you make a living.

423
00:29:55,093 --> 00:29:57,961
I am talking to you
about something else.

424
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:02,066
The security of your country.

425
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:05,236
And, I am sorry if the way
I put it offends you.

426
00:30:05,269 --> 00:30:08,940
We need to know. What
is Abel telling to you?

427
00:30:08,972 --> 00:30:11,041
Do you understand me, Donovan?

428
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:13,111
We need to know.

429
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,144
You do not go with
"Boy Scout" on me.

430
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,381
We do not have a
rulebook, here.

431
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:21,486
You are Agent Hoffman, yeah.

432
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,387
Yeah.

433
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,490
German extraction.

434
00:30:25,522 --> 00:30:26,958
Yeah, so?

435
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,893
My name is Donovan. Irish.

436
00:30:28,926 --> 00:30:31,328
Both sides, mother and father.

437
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:34,499
I am Irish. You are German.

438
00:30:34,531 --> 00:30:37,367
What makes us both Americans?

439
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,470
Just one thing.

440
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:41,503
One, one, one.

441
00:30:42,272 --> 00:30:44,272
The rulebook.

442
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,176
We call it the Constitution.

443
00:30:46,211 --> 00:30:48,211
And, we agree to the rules.

444
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:49,980
That is what makes
us Americans.

445
00:30:50,013 --> 00:30:51,148
It is all that makes
us Americans.

446
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,250
So, do not tell me
there is no rulebook.

447
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,885
And, do not nod at me like
that, you son of a bitch!

448
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:08,029
Do we need to worry
about you?

449
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,903
Not if I have been left
alone to do my job.

450
00:31:26,984 --> 00:31:28,219
From this moment, forward.

451
00:31:28,252 --> 00:31:30,989
You will not refer to the
U-2 as a spy plane.

452
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:33,023
Or, reconnaissance aircraft.

453
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,292
You will refer to it
as: "The Article."

454
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:38,462
The Article has an
80-foot wingspan.

455
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,001
A single Pratt powers and
Whitney J57 P-37 engine.

456
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:46,403
10,000 pounds of thrust.

457
00:31:46,436 --> 00:31:50,474
A maximum speed of
430 miles an hour.

458
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:52,242
She may not be quick,

459
00:31:52,277 --> 00:31:55,179
but at your cruising
altitude of 70,000 feet,

460
00:31:55,212 --> 00:31:57,015
nothing will come
close to you.

461
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,182
70,000?

462
00:31:58,215 --> 00:32:01,184
The idea is the enemy does
not even, know you are there.

463
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,219
It looks somewhat flimsy.

464
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:10,094
Every extra pound of weight
costs a foot in altitude.

465
00:32:10,127 --> 00:32:12,127
We need to accommodate
the cameras.

466
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:18,068
That is a 4,500-millimeter
lens, times three.

467
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,404
A pin-sharp panoramic camera.

468
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:25,076
Four times as powerful as any aerial
reconnaissance cameras we have ever used.

469
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:28,313
You are going taking
pictures, many pictures.

470
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:30,615
At 70,000 feet. The
Article can photograph.

471
00:32:30,647 --> 00:32:34,585
2,000 square miles of
territories in one pass.

472
00:32:34,618 --> 00:32:36,354
Now, drivers,

473
00:32:36,386 --> 00:32:39,523
give the Agent Sumner
your undivided attention.

474
00:32:39,557 --> 00:32:43,627
The items you will need on
your mission is all over here.

475
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:46,364
<i>B camera, revere 8
model 40 magazine,</i>

476
00:32:46,396 --> 00:32:49,232
<i>Keystone Capri K-25, silver.</i>

477
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,234
All how handle shaving brush.

478
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,404
Complete set of cipher tablets
on edible silver, foil.

479
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,439
Specialist photographic
equipment.

480
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,179
Yeah. We get the idea.
Thank you.

481
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:16,426
Excuse me. Agent Bosco.
"Blasco."

482
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:18,296
<i>Sir.</i>

483
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:23,334
There seems to be a
subsection to this list here.

484
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:25,369
Most of this stuff
came from his studio.

485
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,643
But, the rest is from the hotel
room he was holed up in.

486
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,672
Where we found him.

487
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:32,643
The hotel room you searched.

488
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:34,444
Yeah.

489
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:36,547
Can I see the warrant?

490
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:38,580
What?

491
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,153
Yeah, explain this to me.
There was a warrant.

492
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:43,520
There was a warrant.

493
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:45,623
A civil detention writ for
the arrest of an alien,

494
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:47,525
but, there was no
search warrant,

495
00:33:47,557 --> 00:33:49,359
for suspicion of
criminal activity.

496
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:50,627
So, the search,
and the evidence.

497
00:33:50,661 --> 00:33:52,396
That is the fruit
of that search,

498
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,531
That is all tainted, and
should not be admitted.

499
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:57,300
What protections he is due,
your honor. The man is not...

500
00:33:57,335 --> 00:34:00,171
Who is the man? He is
Rudolf Ivanovich Abel.

501
00:34:00,203 --> 00:34:02,105
He is a Soviet citizen.

502
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,407
He is not an American.

503
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:07,577
1886, Wick Wo vs. Hopkins.

504
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:10,715
The court held that even aliens,
in case Chinese immigrants,

505
00:34:10,748 --> 00:34:14,117
could not be held to answer for a
crime without due process of law,

506
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,351
including any, alien that
entered the country illegally.

507
00:34:16,586 --> 00:34:18,188
The Department of Justice...

508
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:21,458
has its first allegiance
to the United States.

509
00:34:21,492 --> 00:34:23,594
I do not see how an alien,
if he is here illegally,

510
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:26,496
how he suffered
deprivation of rights.

511
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,331
Rights as what?

512
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,201
An American?

513
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:33,371
Rights as what, Counselor?

514
00:34:33,403 --> 00:34:35,206
We are in a battle
for civilization.

515
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,443
This Russian spy came here
to threaten our way of life.

516
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,545
Now, I have a courtroom
of people waiting.

517
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:42,579
Get out there, sit
beside the Russian.

518
00:34:42,612 --> 00:34:44,748
Let us get this over and done.

519
00:34:44,782 --> 00:34:47,217
And, your motion is denied.

520
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,155
He should take some
insurance out on himself.

521
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:53,757
How did we do?

522
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:55,791
In there.

523
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,630
Not too good.

524
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:01,666
Apparently, you are not
an American citizen.

525
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,634
That is true.

526
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:05,436
And according to your boss.

527
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,469
You are not a Soviet
citizen either.

528
00:35:08,405 --> 00:35:10,974
Well, the boss is
not always, right.

529
00:35:12,275 --> 00:35:14,275
He is always the boss.

530
00:35:18,715 --> 00:35:20,715
Do you never worry?

531
00:35:20,818 --> 00:35:22,818
Would it help?

532
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,827
All rise!

533
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:37,434
"I pledge allegiance
to the Flag."

534
00:35:37,467 --> 00:35:40,538
"Of the United
States of America."

535
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:44,541
"And to the Republic
for which it stands."

536
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:49,447
"One Nation under
God, indivisible."

537
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,748
"With liberty and
justice for all."

538
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,588
<i>First, you have to
know what happens,</i>

539
00:35:57,621 --> 00:35:59,657
<i>when an atomic bomb explodes.</i>

540
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,496
<i>There is a bright flash,
brighter than the sun.</i>

541
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:09,666
<i>It can smash buildings,
break windows all over town.</i>

542
00:36:11,735 --> 00:36:14,739
<i>But if you are in shelter
and cover like Bert,</i>

543
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:16,706
<i>you will be much safer.</i>

544
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,842
<i>There are two kinds of attack,</i>

545
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,311
<i>with warning, without
any warning.</i>

546
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:27,617
What is going on in here?

547
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:29,519
<i>Okay, Dad.
This is very important.</i>

548
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,588
When the war begins, the
first thing, they do...

549
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:34,324
Is cut off all the water,
and, all the electricity.

550
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:36,460
The first thing we should
do is keep filled,

551
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:37,827
use the shower in your room,

552
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,364
use the sink downstairs,
the garden hose outside.

553
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,465
Those are good ideas.

554
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,467
Roger, I do not see this.

555
00:36:44,501 --> 00:36:46,501
As being something, you
have to worry.

556
00:36:47,804 --> 00:36:49,072
Yeah, but when you
hear the sirens.

557
00:36:49,206 --> 00:36:52,309
There may not be enough time
to fill the tub and the sinks.

558
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,344
Not will have any sirens.

559
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:57,748
What is this?

560
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:58,815
When the bomb comes,

561
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:01,686
the Reds will aim go for
the Empire State Building.

562
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,521
But, the bomb goes off
at 10,000 feet up.

563
00:37:04,554 --> 00:37:06,489
In Life magazine, it
is called an air burst.

564
00:37:06,523 --> 00:37:08,525
And, if the bomb
is 50 megatons.

565
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:11,728
The blast wave goes
out and out and out.

566
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:14,297
And, melts everything
from here to here.

567
00:37:14,331 --> 00:37:16,331
Including where we live.

568
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,501
Yeah. Right there.

569
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:19,637
You know Roger,

570
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:22,306
no one is dropping
Atomic bombs on us.

571
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,708
The Russians want to.

572
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,740
You know that Russian
person, you are defending.

573
00:37:25,876 --> 00:37:26,643
He is here to get
things ready.

574
00:37:26,976 --> 00:37:28,579
For the people who
drop the bombs.

575
00:37:28,612 --> 00:37:30,681
No. No, he is not...
Not is here for that.

576
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,315
He is not even Russian.

577
00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:34,385
He was born, we think,
in Northern England.

578
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:36,418
Yeah. But, he is a
spy for Russia.

579
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,922
I do not even understand.
What are you doing?

580
00:37:38,956 --> 00:37:41,391
You are not a Communist.
So, why are you defending one?

581
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,393
Well, because it is my job.

582
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,463
It never used to be.

583
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:17,427
<i>In the case of the United
States of America,</i>

584
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,664
versus Rudolf Abel.

585
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,365
As to the first count
in the indictment.

586
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,467
<I>How do you find the defendant?</I>

587
00:38:24,501 --> 00:38:26,737
<I>Guilty or not guilty?</I>

588
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,771
Guilty.

589
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,641
<I>As to the second count?</I>

590
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:31,876
Guilty.

591
00:38:32,909 --> 00:38:34,978
<I>As to the third count?</I>

592
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:36,246
Guilty.

593
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,648
Your honor. I make a motion to
set aside these guilty verdicts.

594
00:38:38,682 --> 00:38:40,418
Against the weight
of evidence.

595
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:41,952
Denied.

596
00:38:41,985 --> 00:38:43,853
The jury discharged.

597
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,887
Thank you.

598
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,557
I would like to add that,
if I were one of you.

599
00:38:47,891 --> 00:38:49,891
I would have reached
the same verdict.

600
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:53,963
Sentencing will be.

601
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
<i>November 15.</i>

602
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:08,512
The death sentence is not
a foregone conclusion.

603
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:10,545
Do not worry.

604
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,849
I am not afraid to die,
Mr. Donovan.

605
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,722
Although.

606
00:39:17,755 --> 00:39:19,755
It would not be
my first choice.

607
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,996
You left this behind.

608
00:39:27,664 --> 00:39:29,664
Thank you.

609
00:39:31,534 --> 00:39:33,534
Thank you very much!

610
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:55,693
You have never asked me,
if the charges were true.

611
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,431
If I am indeed a spy.

612
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,068
This is how we do it.

613
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:07,503
The case against you matters.

614
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:08,873
Making them prove it matters.

615
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:10,807
The fiction is...

616
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,809
Whether you did it or
not does not matter.

617
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:15,813
The state has to prove
it, that you are a spy.

618
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,846
You are not curious.

619
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,550
No, not really.

620
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,085
I always assumed you
were an artist.

621
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:24,054
<I>My wife, she is the artist.</I>

622
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,690
She is a musician.

623
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,527
In the Children's
Orchestra of Moscow.

624
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:31,896
What instrument?

625
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,929
The Harp.

626
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,865
Then, she is an Angel.

627
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:50,614
Standing there like that,
you remind me a man,.

628
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:52,882
Who used to come to our house.
When I was young.

629
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:57,655
My father used to say:
"Watch this man."

630
00:40:58,822 --> 00:41:02,092
I did every time he came.

631
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,094
And, never once.

632
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:07,965
He did anything remarkable.

633
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,536
And, I remind you of him.

634
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:19,777
This one time, I was about
the age of your son.

635
00:41:19,809 --> 00:41:22,913
Our house overrun by
partisan border guards.

636
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:29,018
Dozens of them.

637
00:41:29,052 --> 00:41:31,088
My father was beaten and
my mother was beaten.

638
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:34,525
This man, my father's
friend, he was beaten.

639
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:38,193
I watched this man.

640
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,632
Every time they hit him.

641
00:41:45,135 --> 00:41:47,135
He stood back up again.

642
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,039
They hit him harder.

643
00:41:52,876 --> 00:41:54,945
Still, he gets back on his feet.

644
00:41:58,648 --> 00:42:00,885
I think because of this,
they stopped beating him.

645
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:02,918
They let him alive.

646
00:42:10,827 --> 00:42:12,862
I remember them saying it.

647
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,773
It means like:

648
00:42:25,108 --> 00:42:27,108
"Standing man."

649
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:32,213
"Standing man."

650
00:42:43,092 --> 00:42:45,695
- Hello, Jim!
- Millie, you are a vision.

651
00:42:45,728 --> 00:42:48,097
Mortie is busy getting ready.

652
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,132
Come on in.

653
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,804
- Scotch, Jim?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

654
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,836
Just a drop of water.

655
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:57,942
Your honor.

656
00:42:57,974 --> 00:43:00,844
Hello, Jim! Just going out.

657
00:43:00,878 --> 00:43:02,846
I got a few minutes though.

658
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,849
March of Dimes thing.
Millie is active.

659
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,052
Well, thank you for seeing me.

660
00:43:09,085 --> 00:43:13,123
I just wanted to give you my
two cents on the sentencing.

661
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,260
And, I thought maybe, I
should pester you at home.

662
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,262
As not all of my points
are narrowly legal.

663
00:43:19,295 --> 00:43:22,065
Yeah. It is that kind of case.

664
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,134
I hope I was not too
scratchy during the trial.

665
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:27,003
It is exactly what you say.

666
00:43:27,036 --> 00:43:29,036
Nothing about this
is narrowly legal.

667
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:32,773
There are bigger issues.

668
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,309
Bigger issues!

669
00:43:37,313 --> 00:43:39,313
Thank you, thank you.

670
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,887
Sir?

671
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,922
I think it could
be considered.

672
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:48,726
In the best interests
of the United States.

673
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:51,695
That Abel remains alive.

674
00:43:52,195 --> 00:43:53,998
Why?

675
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,766
I am not saying, I
made up my mind.

676
00:43:55,798 --> 00:43:56,934
But if he was going
to cooperate,

677
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,166
work with the government.
He would have done it already.

678
00:43:59,369 --> 00:44:00,269
- True, but the issue here.
- You cannot.

679
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,304
Excuse me.

680
00:44:06,809 --> 00:44:09,713
You cannot say it is in the best
interest of the United States.

681
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:13,916
That he spend the rest of
his days in a prison cell.

682
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,019
How is this national interest?

683
00:44:16,052 --> 00:44:18,387
Not the incarceration
itself, Sir.

684
00:44:19,856 --> 00:44:22,925
It is possible in
the near future.

685
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:25,195
An American of
equivalent rank.

686
00:44:25,228 --> 00:44:27,965
Might be captured
by Soviet Russia.

687
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,233
We might want to have
someone to trade.

688
00:44:30,266 --> 00:44:31,635
Wow!

689
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,137
That sounds like what-ifs.

690
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:36,170
You could do that until
the cows come home.

691
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:39,043
It is my business, what-ifs.
I am in insurance.

692
00:44:39,175 --> 00:44:41,344
And, there is nothing
implausible about this one.

693
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:44,782
It is entirely really,
of what could happen.

694
00:44:44,815 --> 00:44:48,184
It is the kind of probability
for people buys insurance.

695
00:44:48,217 --> 00:44:52,155
If we send this person to his death.
We leave ourselves wide open.

696
00:44:52,188 --> 00:44:54,958
No policy in our back pocket,

697
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:56,992
for the day the storm comes.

698
00:44:58,996 --> 00:45:01,231
Nice speech.

699
00:45:01,264 --> 00:45:06,903
Sir, there is also the
humanitarian an argument.

700
00:45:06,936 --> 00:45:10,007
Should he die for doing the
job they sent him to do?

701
00:45:12,141 --> 00:45:14,141
All right! Counselor.

702
00:45:16,012 --> 00:45:18,012
I have to run.

703
00:45:20,983 --> 00:45:22,983
Good see you, Jim.

704
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:28,356
I will walk you out.

705
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,295
<i>All rise!</i>

706
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:35,231
<i>The United States
District Court.</i>

707
00:45:35,465 --> 00:45:38,034
<i>For the Eastern District of
New York is now in session.</i>

708
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,137
<i>The honorable Mortimer
Byers presiding.</i>

709
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,842
<i>Be seated.</i>

710
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,088
The defendant
will please rise.

711
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,172
In the measured
judgment of this court,

712
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,440
the following sentence,

713
00:46:17,474 --> 00:46:19,976
based upon the jury's
verdict of guilty.

714
00:46:20,010 --> 00:46:22,311
As to each count
of the indictment,

715
00:46:22,346 --> 00:46:27,150
<I>is believe to meet the
test, which has stated.</I>

716
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,086
Pursuant to the verdict of
guilty as to all counts.

717
00:46:32,422 --> 00:46:34,324
The defendant is committed
to the custody,

718
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,425
of the Attorney General
of the United States.

719
00:46:38,461 --> 00:46:40,963
For imprisonment in a
federal institution,

720
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,434
to be selected by him for
a period of 30 years.

721
00:46:45,568 --> 00:46:47,938
<I>Marshals, you may take the
defendant into custody.</I>

722
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:49,072
No... No electrocution?

723
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,074
No. No, no.

724
00:46:50,106 --> 00:46:52,141
Why are not we hanging him?

725
00:46:52,275 --> 00:46:54,577
<I>In the name of God.
Why are not we hanging him?</I>

726
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:55,411
Sit down!

727
00:46:55,644 --> 00:46:59,148
<I>He is a spy! He is killing
us with his lies!</I>

728
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:00,918
In the name of God.
Why are not we hanging him?

729
00:47:00,951 --> 00:47:02,951
That is right!

730
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,519
<I>He is a spy!</I>

731
00:47:09,458 --> 00:47:11,360
<I>Mr. Donovan? Mr. Donovan?</I>

732
00:47:11,394 --> 00:47:14,364
- Just one question.
- Just one question, Sir.

733
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:23,405
My hat! My hat!

734
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:26,744
Nobody here has a comment.

735
00:47:26,976 --> 00:47:28,512
Mr. and Mrs. Donovan
are not answering questions.

736
00:47:28,644 --> 00:47:29,746
How do you feel now?

737
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:31,148
This national
nightmare is over.

738
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,481
Mr. Donovan, are you
happy with the verdict?

739
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:36,119
We are... We are firm
in case on appeal.

740
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:38,152
- Appeal?
- Appeal, yes.

741
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,402
<i>Jim, you did a great job.</i>

742
00:47:53,436 --> 00:47:56,206
<i>You fulfilled your
mandate and, then some.</i>

743
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:58,242
The man is a spy.

744
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:00,978
The verdict is correct and there
is no reason to appeal it?

745
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:02,945
There is ample
procedural reason.

746
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,047
We know the search is tainted.

747
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:05,248
Fourth Amendment issues.

748
00:48:05,282 --> 00:48:07,284
Will always weigh more heavily
in an appellate forum.

749
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,018
We have a good shot.

750
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,021
What about the goddamn
are you talking?

751
00:48:12,054 --> 00:48:15,259
We were supposed to show he had a
capable defense, which we did.

752
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,360
Why are you citing the
goddamn constitution at me?

753
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,295
Tom, if you look
me in the eye.

754
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:21,364
And, tell me we do
not have grounds,

755
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,398
for an appeal, I will
drop it right now.

756
00:48:22,431 --> 00:48:24,568
I am not saying that, you
know what I am saying.

757
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,036
Tom is saying there is
a cost to these things.

758
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,572
That is right.

759
00:48:28,605 --> 00:48:31,240
A cost to both your
family and your firm.

760
00:49:06,242 --> 00:49:09,079
I missed music.

761
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,447
They checked the radio to make sure
there was no transmitter in it.

762
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:13,481
I am sure they did.

763
00:49:19,489 --> 00:49:22,092
That is a very great
artist, Shostakovitch.

764
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,574
I think.

765
00:49:40,543 --> 00:49:44,514
Our strongest grounds
for reversal,

766
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:46,547
are constitutional.

767
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:52,422
Our best chance is if the Supreme
Court agrees to review your case.

768
00:49:58,094 --> 00:50:00,094
Jim.

769
00:50:06,202 --> 00:50:08,202
You should be careful.

770
00:50:13,175 --> 00:50:15,175
Careful.

771
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,215
<i>77 Sunset Strip.</i>

772
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:21,351
<i>Edward Byrnes.</i>

773
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:24,253
<i>77 Sunset Strip.</i>

774
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:26,286
<i>And Richard Long.</i>

775
00:50:26,722 --> 00:50:28,324
<i>Good morning, Suzanne.</i>

776
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,659
<i>Good morning, Dick.</i>

777
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,693
<i>There is a special delivery
letter here for you.</i>

778
00:50:32,596 --> 00:50:34,596
<i>Her.</i>

779
00:50:44,507 --> 00:50:46,507
Mom!

780
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,278
What in the God's
name happened.

781
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:50,713
Honey, are you all right?

782
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:52,282
- Mom!
- Are you hurt?

783
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,315
I have her to upstairs!

784
00:50:56,519 --> 00:50:58,320
- Are you all right?
- I sat with my back against the wall, Dad!

785
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:00,106
Are you okay?
Are you all right?

786
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,557
Dad, I sat with my
back against the wall!

787
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:02,659
- Good, good.
- Away from the windows!

788
00:51:02,692 --> 00:51:04,260
Good, good, good.

789
00:51:04,293 --> 00:51:06,496
Good boy, good boy, good boy.

790
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,197
It is okay. It is all right!

791
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,367
It is all right! They are
gone. They are gone.

792
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,235
They are cowards.
They are gone.

793
00:51:12,268 --> 00:51:14,637
We have detectives
canvassing in the neighborhood.

794
00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:16,572
Maybe we will find a
description of the car.

795
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:18,375
I do not think It
is very likely.

796
00:51:18,407 --> 00:51:20,309
We are going to
need protection.

797
00:51:20,342 --> 00:51:22,711
I have instructions to
leave two cars here.

798
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,413
It will be very obvious.

799
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:24,648
For how long.

800
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,184
I have to be in Washington
later on this week.

801
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,585
What are you doing?

802
00:51:28,617 --> 00:51:29,753
What are you doing
to your family?

803
00:51:29,786 --> 00:51:31,454
Pardon me, Officer.

804
00:51:31,487 --> 00:51:32,621
You are still defending
this person.

805
00:51:32,655 --> 00:51:33,389
Why are you fighting for him?

806
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:35,492
Okay. Knock that off, Officer.

807
00:51:35,525 --> 00:51:36,760
I will knock off nothing.

808
00:51:36,992 --> 00:51:38,427
I was in the third
wave at Omaha Beach.

809
00:51:38,461 --> 00:51:39,563
I did my time in the service.

810
00:51:39,695 --> 00:51:41,498
I was fighting these people.
Are you defending them?

811
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,233
Why do not you just do your
job as an officer of the law?

812
00:51:44,266 --> 00:51:45,768
Okay, I am sorry. Let
us go outside. Come on!

813
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:47,336
What do you know?
Just forget him.

814
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:48,637
What am I not getting here?

815
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:52,641
Outside, Officer. I am sorry.

816
00:51:52,675 --> 00:51:55,478
<i>Defending a commie spy. Jesus!</i>

817
00:52:12,795 --> 00:52:15,331
<i>Do you feel you
deserve this, Sir?</i>

818
00:52:37,586 --> 00:52:38,755
<i>Should it become necessary?</i>

819
00:52:38,788 --> 00:52:41,824
<i>To abandon the aircraft
over Soviet territory.</i>

820
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,427
Then, there is a two and a
half-pound explosive charge,

821
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,695
contained within the fuselage.

822
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,699
First, you activate the circuits.

823
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:54,637
But to start the
70-second timer.

824
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:57,574
You need to flip the
switch marked: "Destruct."

825
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,681
<I>It is imperative these
flights remain a secret.</I>

826
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:08,251
<I>And, this equipment does
not fall into enemy hands.</I>

827
00:53:08,284 --> 00:53:10,420
What about us?

828
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:12,621
I do not know if you are
kidding, Lieutenant Powers.

829
00:53:12,655 --> 00:53:14,655
I am not.

830
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:17,860
What do you know
about the plane,

831
00:53:17,893 --> 00:53:20,262
is as secret as
the plane itself.

832
00:53:22,431 --> 00:53:25,601
If capture is a
foregone conclusion.

833
00:53:25,635 --> 00:53:27,670
You go down with your plane.

834
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:30,606
Now, if you think, you
can ditch and get away.

835
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,309
If you are, close enough
to a border, fine.

836
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:34,342
You know the
ejection protocol.

837
00:53:36,346 --> 00:53:38,748
But, if you ditch.

838
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:40,884
You bring the dollar with you.

839
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,452
There is a pin inside.

840
00:53:45,688 --> 00:53:48,625
You scratch your skin anywhere,
it is instantaneous.

841
00:53:48,657 --> 00:53:51,628
<i>If you think, you
will be captured...</i>

842
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:53,661
<i>You use it.</i>

843
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,800
Drivers do you understand me?

844
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,603
Spend the dollar.

845
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,528
<i>Mr. Chief of Justice,
may it please the court?</i>

846
00:54:59,561 --> 00:55:02,898
<i>The "Cold War" is not just
a phrase. Your Honor.</i>

847
00:55:02,931 --> 00:55:05,568
It is not just a
figure of speech.

848
00:55:05,601 --> 00:55:07,737
Truly, a battle
is being fought,

849
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:11,574
between two competing
views of the world.

850
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,844
I contend that Rudolf
Ivanovich Abel.

851
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:16,980
"Colonel Abel,"
as he was called.

852
00:55:17,012 --> 00:55:19,449
Even by the man
who arrested him.

853
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:22,619
Is our foe in that battle?

854
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,387
Auxiliary power.

855
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:25,989
Connected and on.

856
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:28,458
Oxygen seat pack supply.

857
00:55:28,490 --> 00:55:29,925
Supply at 1,800.

858
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,628
Inverter?

859
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:32,795
On, light out.

860
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:35,998
He was treated as a
combatant in that war.

861
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:40,003
Until it no longer suited our
government to treat him.

862
00:55:40,036 --> 00:55:42,405
Accordingly.

863
00:55:42,438 --> 00:55:45,875
He not gave the protections.
We give our own citizens.

864
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:47,643
He subjected to
treatment that,

865
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,447
however appropriate for a
suspected enemy.

866
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,949
It was not appropriate
to a suspected criminal.

867
00:55:52,981 --> 00:55:54,416
Fuel transfer?

868
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,518
Transfer switch off.

869
00:55:55,552 --> 00:55:56,652
Destructor?

870
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:57,820
Destructor safety.

871
00:55:57,853 --> 00:55:59,021
Climb data card.

872
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:01,054
Installed in aircraft.

873
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:16,739
I know this man.

874
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:20,577
If the charge is true, he serves a foreign
power but he serves it faithfully.

875
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,547
If he is a soldier in the opposing
army, he is a good soldier.

876
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,516
He has not fled the field
of battle to save himself.

877
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,719
He has refused to
serve his captor.

878
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:32,054
He has refused to
betray his cause.

879
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,657
He has refused to take
the cowards' way out.

880
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:37,527
The coward must
abandon his dignity.

881
00:56:37,559 --> 00:56:39,061
Before he abandons
the field of battle.

882
00:56:39,094 --> 00:56:42,532
That Rudolf Abel will never do.

883
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,666
Should not we?

884
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,869
By give him the full benefit.

885
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,505
Of the rights that define
our system of government.

886
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:50,940
Show this man who we are.

887
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,777
Who we are.

888
00:56:53,809 --> 00:56:58,081
Is that the greatest weapon?
We have in this Cold War.

889
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:01,083
Will we stand by our
cause less resolutely?

890
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:03,117
Than he stands by his.

891
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,818
<i>The President announced.</i>

892
00:59:48,851 --> 00:59:52,789
<i>That a NASA weather plane disappeared
four days ago north of Turkey.</i>

893
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:54,724
<i>And, the Space
Administration fears.</i>

894
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,992
<i>That its pilot
died in the crash.</i>

895
00:59:57,025 --> 00:59:59,862
<i>Radar showed the plane
wandering off course.</i>

896
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:03,865
<i>Deep into Soviet territory
before contact was lost,</i>

897
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,934
<i>complicated any
effort to recover it.</i>

898
01:00:05,969 --> 01:00:08,003
<i>Or the remains of the pilot.</i>

899
01:00:08,036 --> 01:00:10,273
<i>Now the news out
of Washington.</i>

900
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,373
<i>In a close vote today.</i>

901
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,077
<i>The Supreme Court
affirmed the conviction.</i>

902
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,913
<i>Of Russian spy Rudolf
Ivanovich Abel.</i>

903
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:18,880
<i>Five votes to four.</i>

904
01:00:18,914 --> 01:00:21,150
<i>The case presented civil
liberties issues.</i>

905
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:24,954
<i>According to the Russian's
lawyer, James B. Donovan.</i>

906
01:00:24,987 --> 01:00:27,155
<i>When asked how he felt
about today's loss,</i>

907
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:31,059
<i>Mr. Donovan simply
said: "Tired."</i>

908
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:34,230
<i>I will have more news for you
after this message.</i>

909
01:00:34,262 --> 01:00:36,262
<i>Styling tricks.</i>

910
01:00:36,731 --> 01:00:37,565
It is over.

911
01:00:37,998 --> 01:00:39,101
<i>See the new, exciting
styling tricks.</i>

912
01:00:39,134 --> 01:00:41,134
<i>You...</i>

913
01:00:42,170 --> 01:00:44,106
Marty?

914
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:47,010
I will be damned if I can find the
file on that Prudential case.

915
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:50,313
I... Mr. Waters had moved it
over to Jack Elwes's office.

916
01:00:50,346 --> 01:00:52,248
Along with the first
draft of the appeal.

917
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,782
He did.

918
01:00:53,815 --> 01:00:56,985
Yeah. He redrafted and filed that last
week while you were in Washington.

919
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:00,922
<i>How long have we
been together?</i>

920
01:01:00,956 --> 01:01:03,793
<i>You act as if I have
never closed a deal.</i>

921
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,829
<i>Set up a meeting
somewhere fancy.</i>

922
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:09,032
I am betting Mr. Young would
like some of the finer things.

923
01:01:09,065 --> 01:01:10,800
New York has to offer.

924
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,833
<i>I want you to give
me the summary of...</i>

925
01:01:31,086 --> 01:01:33,121
Do you know anyone
from Leipzig?

926
01:01:33,155 --> 01:01:37,827
"Leipzig." Am I getting
hate mail from Germany now?

927
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,860
From East Germany.

928
01:01:48,036 --> 01:01:50,005
Is it your new one?

929
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,039
No.

930
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:54,309
No, no, no, no.

931
01:01:54,342 --> 01:01:58,047
She pretends to be but it is
not even a good pretense.

932
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,018
"I am taking this liberty
to write to you."

933
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,286
"After having learned
from the newspapers."

934
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:07,123
"About your most
humane attitude."

935
01:02:07,155 --> 01:02:11,126
"Towards my beloved
husband, Rudolf Abel."

936
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,963
Do I write back?

937
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,833
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

938
01:02:22,871 --> 01:02:26,242
What is the next move when you
do not know the game?

939
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:30,210
<i>Francis Gary Powers.</i>

940
01:02:31,447 --> 01:02:36,818
"On the strength of Article
2 of the U.S.S.R. law."

941
01:02:36,853 --> 01:02:40,422
"On criminal responsibility
for state crimes."

942
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:42,958
"To 10 years of confinement."

943
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,360
"The first three years
to be served in the prison."

944
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:49,431
"The term of the punishment,"

945
01:02:49,465 --> 01:02:52,335
"including preliminary
detention."

946
01:02:52,367 --> 01:02:55,036
"It shall be counted
from May 1,"

947
01:02:55,070 --> 01:02:57,206
"nineteen hundred and sixty."

948
01:03:23,032 --> 01:03:25,367
<i>Mr. Donovan. Thank you
so much for coming.</i>

949
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,869
It is a pleasure to
meet you, Mr. Dulles.

950
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,903
It is an honor, Sir.

951
01:03:30,373 --> 01:03:34,476
Nescafe, cream, two lumps.

952
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,978
Thank you.

953
01:03:37,012 --> 01:03:39,181
Okay, this letter
you received,

954
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,918
seems clear that the Soviets
are making an overture here.

955
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,586
They are doing it
through East Germany.

956
01:03:44,619 --> 01:03:46,989
Because they still do not want to
acknowledge Abel as a Soviet citizen.

957
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:49,157
Much less a Soviet spy. So...

958
01:03:50,492 --> 01:03:52,195
Lot of fiction is going on.

959
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,463
Yes, Sir, but you know end.

960
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,932
They got our person,
our spy pilot.

961
01:03:56,965 --> 01:03:58,965
We have their person.

962
01:04:01,137 --> 01:04:04,407
Prisoner exchange, I think
that is what they are after.

963
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,076
Which could hardly be a
surprise to you, Counselor?

964
01:04:07,108 --> 01:04:10,045
It is an eventuality.
I think you foresaw.

965
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,248
Yes. I sure did, and I
am so rarely right.

966
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,385
Congratulations
Red-letter day.

967
01:04:16,418 --> 01:04:20,489
Now, we have our man
over there. Powers.

968
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:24,460
Good man, but with a head full
of classified information.

969
01:04:24,492 --> 01:04:27,128
Abel has a head full of
classified information, too.

970
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:29,130
He has not given us a lick.

971
01:04:29,164 --> 01:04:30,967
Sir takes it from me.
He will not.

972
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,369
Yes, we know that, but
the Russians do not.

973
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:36,271
They want their man
back before he cracks.

974
01:04:36,304 --> 01:04:39,242
We want Powers back
for the same reasons.

975
01:04:42,577 --> 01:04:44,947
I think you are saying, Sir...

976
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:47,416
That might be a successful
conclusion for everyone.

977
01:04:47,449 --> 01:04:50,418
Yes, if we indulge
their fiction.

978
01:04:58,594 --> 01:05:01,030
We want you to
negotiate the swap.

979
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:02,231
Because you are a
private citizen.

980
01:05:02,264 --> 01:05:04,432
It is not governments talking.

981
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,168
They do not acknowledge
Abel as a Soviet citizen.

982
01:05:07,202 --> 01:05:10,972
We do not acknowledge East
Germany as a sovereign country.

983
01:05:11,007 --> 01:05:12,275
We have not recognized
East Berlin.

984
01:05:12,307 --> 01:05:15,043
Since it annexed by
the Soviets in 45.

985
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:18,280
I act as a negotiator,
representing...

986
01:05:18,313 --> 01:05:20,148
You are not
representing anybody.

987
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:21,222
Not a government official.

988
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,418
You have no official standing.

989
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,452
So, some fiction on
our side as well.

990
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:26,789
Correct.

991
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:30,192
This means, of course, you cannot
rely on any acknowledgment.

992
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,994
Or, help if things go south.

993
01:05:33,028 --> 01:05:35,097
CIA cannot be responsible.

994
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:37,130
<I>We cannot be embarrassed.</I>

995
01:05:39,367 --> 01:05:41,503
Where do they want this
negotiation to take place?

996
01:05:41,536 --> 01:05:42,905
There.

997
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,340
"There"?

998
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:46,373
East Berlin.

999
01:05:48,143 --> 01:05:50,313
Well, is not East Berlin
getting rather...?

1000
01:05:50,346 --> 01:05:52,547
Yes, the place is
getting complicated.

1001
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,483
Yeah, complicated.

1002
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:02,057
The Soviet side has been setting up
checkpoints for the past few months.

1003
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:04,393
To try to stop people hemorrhaging
to the Western sectors.

1004
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,262
It has not worked.

1005
01:06:06,295 --> 01:06:08,097
<I>We have intelligence
to suggest.</I>

1006
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:10,266
<I>They may go one-step further.</I>

1007
01:06:10,298 --> 01:06:12,400
<I>And, well off the
entire Eastern sector.</I>

1008
01:06:18,273 --> 01:06:20,509
Okay, that is it briefly.

1009
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,211
The decision is
entirely yours.

1010
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:26,315
You need time to kick around it.

1011
01:06:32,288 --> 01:06:34,523
No.

1012
01:06:34,556 --> 01:06:35,657
No. I do not.

1013
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:38,594
Fine. Fine.

1014
01:06:38,626 --> 01:06:41,197
Best this all remains
confidential.

1015
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:46,302
Let us not discuss any of this
with Mary or anyone else.

1016
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:48,471
Share the correspondence
only with us.

1017
01:06:48,503 --> 01:06:50,338
Let us know what they
want to do and when.

1018
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:53,309
I have no client, no
wife and no country.

1019
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,411
Do not know what for I
am doing or when or who?

1020
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,179
You are doing it
for your country.

1021
01:06:58,213 --> 01:07:00,215
But, your country does
not know that yet.

1022
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:03,351
What about my client, the other
person in this equation? My person?

1023
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:05,253
Your person? You
mean the Russian.

1024
01:07:05,286 --> 01:07:07,155
He is not your person
anymore, Counselor.

1025
01:07:07,188 --> 01:07:10,226
Your person is Francis
Gary Powers now.

1026
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:13,128
What do I tell to Rudolf Abel?

1027
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:15,161
Tell him not to drop dead.

1028
01:09:07,510 --> 01:09:09,510
Professor?

1029
01:09:14,882 --> 01:09:15,984
Professor?

1030
01:09:16,484 --> 01:09:18,453
Papa went to university.

1031
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,655
You should not be
here, Frederic.

1032
01:09:20,689 --> 01:09:22,557
They are having classes today.

1033
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,827
He went to see where he goes.

1034
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:26,427
What are you doing here?

1035
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:28,463
I came to get you,
and your father.

1036
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,498
You have to come with me. You
might not get out tomorrow.

1037
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:31,734
Just... Just leave.

1038
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:34,203
Yes. Yes, yes, yes, leave.
Right now.

1039
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:07,735
Go back. Go back.

1040
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:10,305
I will be okay. I am American.
Go back.

1041
01:10:10,338 --> 01:10:12,574
Go back to your father.
We will find another way. Go.

1042
01:10:18,413 --> 01:10:19,414
Hey.

1043
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,782
Sir. Hi.

1044
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,488
Papers, please.

1045
01:10:26,521 --> 01:10:28,623
The Student Frederic Pryor.

1046
01:10:28,657 --> 01:10:30,826
Yes, student.

1047
01:10:35,157 --> 01:10:37,157
What kind of photos?

1048
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,340
My name is Frederic Pryor.
I am an economics student.

1049
01:10:46,442 --> 01:10:50,511
It is my dissertation.
My thesis.

1050
01:10:52,614 --> 01:10:54,082
You see. Look, look.

1051
01:10:54,115 --> 01:10:57,720
"The foreign trade system of the
European Communist nations."

1052
01:11:02,890 --> 01:11:04,890
It was a lot of work.

1053
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:14,536
No. That is my only copy.

1054
01:11:15,904 --> 01:11:17,904
No!

1055
01:11:19,774 --> 01:11:21,377
<i>Tell me something.</i>

1056
01:11:21,409 --> 01:11:23,479
It came up at the last minute.

1057
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:25,814
They have offices in London.

1058
01:11:25,847 --> 01:11:28,817
These clients. Not my idea.

1059
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:31,487
Scotland, this
fishing expedition.

1060
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:33,721
What kind of
fishing trip, Jim?

1061
01:11:33,756 --> 01:11:36,492
Salmon fishing.

1062
01:11:36,524 --> 01:11:38,564
Just tell me that you are
not going to be in any danger.

1063
01:11:38,594 --> 01:11:39,927
This is just a routine
business trip.

1064
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:41,962
I will not worry.

1065
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:44,398
I need my passport.

1066
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,471
Just give me something
to hold on.

1067
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:52,506
I do not even care
if it is the truth.

1068
01:11:53,942 --> 01:11:55,942
I am doing this for us.

1069
01:12:19,033 --> 01:12:21,002
<I>Mr. Michener here is
your Berlin escort.</I>

1070
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:23,838
He is an attache with the U.S.
embassy.

1071
01:12:23,872 --> 01:12:26,475
It has gotten goddamn
complicated.

1072
01:12:26,507 --> 01:12:27,876
As you know, the last
letter from Mrs. Abel.

1073
01:12:27,909 --> 01:12:30,011
Whoever she is, talks about
a lawyer in East Berlin.

1074
01:12:30,045 --> 01:12:32,514
Mr. Vogel, whoever he is,
representing her interests, she says.

1075
01:12:32,547 --> 01:12:33,916
Yeah. Vogel says.

1076
01:12:33,948 --> 01:12:35,850
He has gone to the Russian
embassy in East Berlin.

1077
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:38,520
They may be ready to
trade Abel for Powers.

1078
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,456
No one knows who is who.

1079
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:41,724
Essentially, they
are Russian, right.

1080
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:44,560
Well! Soviet. We think so.

1081
01:12:44,592 --> 01:12:47,761
What do you mean? Could we
turn up the heat in here?

1082
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,998
There is a wrinkle.

1083
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:53,469
They might try to throw
you a curve ball.

1084
01:12:53,502 --> 01:12:56,471
Try to get you to accept another
prisoner other than Powers.

1085
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,840
Another American?

1086
01:12:57,872 --> 01:13:01,009
The East German Stasis picked
up an American student.

1087
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:02,243
Frederic Pryor.

1088
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:04,846
The kid they found on the
wrong side of the Wall.

1089
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,648
He is a graduate
student of Yale.

1090
01:13:06,681 --> 01:13:08,716
Came over here to
study economics.

1091
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:12,587
They are making noises about
trying this kid for espionage.

1092
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,056
Grave offense, capital crime.

1093
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,828
Vogel got in touch with us,
said he represents Pryor.

1094
01:13:19,862 --> 01:13:24,800
Wait a minute! Vogel represents
Mrs. Abel and this kid?

1095
01:13:24,832 --> 01:13:26,832
Yeah, he is busy.

1096
01:13:27,636 --> 01:13:28,703
What is he?

1097
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,073
Vogel is East German or Russian?

1098
01:13:31,105 --> 01:13:33,775
Try to figure it out
when you meet him.

1099
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:36,078
At Russian embassy, East
Berlin, noon tomorrow.

1100
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:38,814
Hoffman will show you
how to get there.

1101
01:13:38,846 --> 01:13:40,916
Wait! Show me how to get there.
I am going to have an escort.

1102
01:13:40,948 --> 01:13:42,784
Right?

1103
01:13:42,818 --> 01:13:44,920
That was the plan but as I
said, there is a wrinkle.

1104
01:13:44,953 --> 01:13:47,689
I will not be taking you.
Decision has made.

1105
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:50,492
No U.S. government personnel are to
cross the border until further notice.

1106
01:13:50,525 --> 01:13:51,726
- Why?
- It is too dangerous.

1107
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:53,694
<I>The East Germans
grabbed this kid.</I>

1108
01:13:53,729 --> 01:13:57,666
<i>There is a degree of impunity.
We had not anticipated.</i>

1109
01:13:57,698 --> 01:14:00,668
The point is the East German
agenda and the Russian agenda.

1110
01:14:00,702 --> 01:14:02,104
May not be the same thing.

1111
01:14:02,136 --> 01:14:04,006
Try to figure it out
and, act accordingly.

1112
01:14:04,038 --> 01:14:05,841
Try to make a deal.
Powers for Abel.

1113
01:14:05,873 --> 01:14:08,777
What about this
college kid, Pryor?

1114
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:10,993
Do not you fall for that?

1115
01:14:11,646 --> 01:14:12,713
We can get him out
another time.

1116
01:14:12,747 --> 01:14:14,747
Powers is the whole ball game.

1117
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:39,005
Where is your room?

1118
01:14:39,707 --> 01:14:41,707
I will be staying
at the Hilton.

1119
01:14:43,110 --> 01:14:45,110
It is not far.

1120
01:14:46,180 --> 01:14:48,750
This is a number
here in West Berlin.

1121
01:14:48,783 --> 01:14:50,783
Memorize it, and
give it back to me.

1122
01:14:51,787 --> 01:14:53,787
No, no. I... I mean, now.

1123
01:14:55,756 --> 01:14:57,759
The Soviets keep cutting
the international lines.

1124
01:14:57,792 --> 01:15:00,028
Local calls are okay.

1125
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:02,061
Someone will pick
up day and night.

1126
01:15:10,738 --> 01:15:14,076
Now, this docket attached to your
passport will serve as your ticket.

1127
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:16,109
Into and out of the
Eastern Soviet sector.

1128
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:20,113
The meeting with Vogel is
set for noon tomorrow.

1129
01:15:26,755 --> 01:15:28,657
There are only a few
routes left to the East.

1130
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:30,893
You take the S-Bah, the station.
We showed you on the way in.

1131
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,194
You are going to get off at the
Friedrichstrasse station here.

1132
01:15:33,228 --> 01:15:36,131
Walk to the Soviet embassy
on Under den Linden here.

1133
01:15:36,163 --> 01:15:38,800
Look at the map now. You
should not take it with you.

1134
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:40,935
You are looking at a map. You
are an American. You are a spy.

1135
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,970
You could well detain.

1136
01:15:43,005 --> 01:15:45,073
Just avoid interacting
with people generally.

1137
01:15:45,106 --> 01:15:48,042
You do not... You do not
belong, so do not stick out.

1138
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,177
Food is scarce over there and
things have started to fall apart.

1139
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,412
There are gangs.

1140
01:15:51,445 --> 01:15:54,716
And, rule of law is less firm
established over there.

1141
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:56,752
Definitely stay
away from the Wall.

1142
01:15:56,784 --> 01:15:57,953
On their side,
there is a line.

1143
01:15:57,985 --> 01:15:59,020
Cleared of buildings
along the Wall.

1144
01:15:59,054 --> 01:16:00,756
They call it the "Death Line."

1145
01:16:00,788 --> 01:16:02,690
Cross it and you will shot.

1146
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,060
Where is there any outcome here?
I am not either detained or shot.

1147
01:16:05,092 --> 01:16:07,695
You do not worry too much,
about what Michener said.

1148
01:16:07,729 --> 01:16:09,765
No. I am worried about
what you are saying.

1149
01:16:09,797 --> 01:16:11,800
This kid, Pryor.

1150
01:16:11,832 --> 01:16:13,234
That the East Germans have.
How old is he?

1151
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,671
Twenty-five. Why?

1152
01:16:15,703 --> 01:16:17,703
Same age as Dougie.

1153
01:16:19,207 --> 01:16:20,708
Who?

1154
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,742
An associate of mine.

1155
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,680
Frederic Pryor.

1156
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:05,011
Okay, okay, okay.

1157
01:19:50,252 --> 01:19:56,024
We apologize if this offends.

1158
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,363
Coat?

1159
01:21:16,971 --> 01:21:20,007
- Do you understand English?
- Yes, Sir.

1160
01:21:20,041 --> 01:21:22,143
I am James Donovan.
I am here to meet a Mr. Vogel.

1161
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,279
Mr. Vogel. He does
not work here.

1162
01:21:24,311 --> 01:21:26,311
I am just supposed to meet
him. That is all I know.

1163
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,604
Mr. Donovan!

1164
01:21:52,106 --> 01:21:54,106
We finally meet you.

1165
01:21:55,609 --> 01:21:57,244
I am Helen Abel.

1166
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:58,579
- How is my husband?
- He is fine.

1167
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,081
How is my Rudolf?

1168
01:22:00,114 --> 01:22:02,050
As good as, he can be expected.

1169
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:04,586
We will get him back. Yes.

1170
01:22:04,618 --> 01:22:07,055
- This is our daughter.
- How do you do?

1171
01:22:07,454 --> 01:22:08,454
Lydia.

1172
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,090
Are you Mr. Vogel?

1173
01:22:11,225 --> 01:22:12,560
No, no, no!

1174
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:14,328
I am not Vogel.

1175
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:16,362
I am Drew's cousin.

1176
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:19,333
This is Rudolf's
beloved Drew's cousin.

1177
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:21,569
- Yes. Drew's cousin.
- I am Drew's cousin.

1178
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,305
Drew's cousin, yes.

1179
01:22:23,337 --> 01:22:25,337
I am Helen Abel.

1180
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,510
When will you see him?

1181
01:22:31,345 --> 01:22:33,347
When will your government
releases him?

1182
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:35,350
I am a little lost here.

1183
01:22:35,382 --> 01:22:37,252
I am supposed to meet
a Mr. Vogel.

1184
01:22:37,284 --> 01:22:39,386
Mr. Vogel is our lawyer.

1185
01:22:39,421 --> 01:22:43,358
We were supposed to
negotiate the exchange.

1186
01:22:43,390 --> 01:22:46,161
- Do you bring Rudolf here?
- Yes, yes, bring him here.

1187
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:49,029
It does not happen unilaterally.
Do you understand?

1188
01:22:49,064 --> 01:22:51,064
It has to be an exchange.

1189
01:22:54,202 --> 01:22:56,202
Not here.

1190
01:23:15,689 --> 01:23:17,292
Mr. Donovan?

1191
01:23:17,324 --> 01:23:18,460
Mr. Vogel?

1192
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,395
No, no, no. Goodness.

1193
01:23:20,427 --> 01:23:22,529
My name is Schischkin.
Ivan Schischkin.

1194
01:23:22,564 --> 01:23:24,631
I am the second secretary
of the Soviet embassy.

1195
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:29,170
It would not be appropriate
for Mr. Vogel to join us.

1196
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:31,372
He is a German national.

1197
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:33,608
You are not here to...

1198
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:37,212
To facilitate this meeting.

1199
01:23:37,244 --> 01:23:40,314
Perhaps Mrs. Abel,

1200
01:23:40,347 --> 01:23:42,516
would like to compose
her privately?

1201
01:23:42,550 --> 01:23:45,520
And let Mr. Donovan
and me to talk.

1202
01:23:47,622 --> 01:23:49,622
Thank you.

1203
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,235
- So, I am confused.
- Yes.

1204
01:24:01,269 --> 01:24:02,703
I do not care
whom I talk to...

1205
01:24:02,737 --> 01:24:06,207
If it is about an
exchange of personnel.

1206
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:08,208
Are you the person to talk?

1207
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,179
Yes, yes, yes, of course!
We should talk.

1208
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:13,448
Please, have a seat
Mr. Donovan.

1209
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:17,351
How did you arrive to
the Eastern sector?

1210
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:18,453
The train. The S-Bah.

1211
01:24:18,485 --> 01:24:20,255
You were alone.

1212
01:24:20,287 --> 01:24:21,722
Yeah.

1213
01:24:21,756 --> 01:24:25,126
You are credentialed.

1214
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:27,127
Now, you must know
about me, Sir.

1215
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:28,662
I am a private citizen.

1216
01:24:28,695 --> 01:24:30,664
I am a lawyer in Brooklyn
in the United States.

1217
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,333
I have taken time out
of my busy schedule.

1218
01:24:33,368 --> 01:24:36,136
To help my client,
Rudolf Abel.

1219
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:40,207
I authorized to arrange
an exchange of Abel.

1220
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:42,676
For Francis Gary Powers.

1221
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:45,579
This is a full pardon of Abel.

1222
01:24:45,613 --> 01:24:47,932
That will be signed when the
exchange actually takes place.

1223
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,618
This is the only
reason I am here.

1224
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:53,421
I hope and expect to make
this arrangement quickly.

1225
01:24:54,488 --> 01:24:56,524
Abel for Francis Gary Powers.

1226
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,460
And, Frederic Pryor.

1227
01:25:02,463 --> 01:25:04,466
We do not have Pryor.

1228
01:25:04,498 --> 01:25:06,498
No? You do not!

1229
01:25:08,770 --> 01:25:11,439
I have heard of
Pryor, he has held,

1230
01:25:11,472 --> 01:25:14,609
by the German
Democratic Republic.

1231
01:25:14,641 --> 01:25:17,479
Not by the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1232
01:25:18,412 --> 01:25:21,381
I will tell you the
first problem.

1233
01:25:21,416 --> 01:25:24,418
The names of your
countries are too long.

1234
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:27,521
Yes, yes.

1235
01:25:28,622 --> 01:25:30,591
If we release Powers.

1236
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,594
It is only to promote
a good will...

1237
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,627
Between our countries.

1238
01:25:35,529 --> 01:25:38,166
So, it cannot be an exchange.

1239
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:42,604
Perhaps...

1240
01:25:42,636 --> 01:25:45,506
Perhaps you could
release Abel.

1241
01:25:45,539 --> 01:25:47,475
As a token of good will to
our friends in Germany.

1242
01:25:47,509 --> 01:25:50,377
Then, some months later.

1243
01:25:50,411 --> 01:25:52,814
We would release Powers.

1244
01:25:52,846 --> 01:25:55,283
- There is an idea.
- No. That Just will not work for us at all.

1245
01:25:55,315 --> 01:25:57,618
We need this to
be an exchange.

1246
01:25:57,652 --> 01:25:59,420
You can call it
what you want...

1247
01:25:59,453 --> 01:26:01,288
But an exchange it must be.

1248
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:04,458
We can have Abel here
within 48 hours.

1249
01:26:04,492 --> 01:26:07,962
We need Powers at the same
time. We give you Abel.

1250
01:26:10,863 --> 01:26:12,634
This is...

1251
01:26:12,667 --> 01:26:16,570
Can we call this the
"impatient plan"?

1252
01:26:16,604 --> 01:26:18,604
You can call it
whatever you want.

1253
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,444
I can relay your impatient
plan to Moscow.

1254
01:26:23,478 --> 01:26:24,345
See what they say...

1255
01:26:24,378 --> 01:26:29,114
They will wonder
why so impatient.

1256
01:26:29,317 --> 01:26:30,717
Because I have a cold.

1257
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,752
I do not live in Berlin.
I want to go home.

1258
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,721
They will think...

1259
01:26:34,756 --> 01:26:37,591
"Well, the Americans
must have gotten..."

1260
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,561
"All the information
that Abel had to give."

1261
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:44,399
"And now they are
impatient to trade him."

1262
01:26:44,431 --> 01:26:47,467
"Hoping to get in return
this man Powers."

1263
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,604
"Perhaps, has not
yet given up..."

1264
01:26:49,636 --> 01:26:51,639
"All the information
that he has to give."

1265
01:26:53,507 --> 01:26:55,643
This is not an
equitable trade, Sir.

1266
01:26:56,911 --> 01:26:58,546
What you are saying is...

1267
01:26:58,579 --> 01:27:00,582
If Powers has given up
everything, he knows.

1268
01:27:00,614 --> 01:27:02,850
Then Moscow would trade?

1269
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,884
Why would not they?

1270
01:27:05,619 --> 01:27:08,655
As for Abel, if he dies
in an American prison.

1271
01:27:08,689 --> 01:27:11,359
The next Russian
operative who is caught.

1272
01:27:11,391 --> 01:27:13,427
Might think twice about
keeping his mouth shut.

1273
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:18,800
You never know. Abel might
want to see the sky again.

1274
01:27:18,832 --> 01:27:21,868
And, decide to trade Russian
secrets for small American favors.

1275
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,774
How can we know this?

1276
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:31,479
We are little man.
We just do our jobs.

1277
01:27:31,511 --> 01:27:33,847
Like Lieutenant Powers.
He is just a pilot.

1278
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:40,520
He was making photographs
from 70,000 feet.

1279
01:27:40,555 --> 01:27:42,555
When he has shot from the sky.

1280
01:27:42,689 --> 01:27:44,759
People in my country
consider this...

1281
01:27:44,792 --> 01:27:46,792
An act of war.

1282
01:27:48,962 --> 01:27:51,733
We have to get off this
merry-go-round, Sir.

1283
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:53,533
The next mistake our
countries make...

1284
01:27:53,568 --> 01:27:55,568
Could be the last one.

1285
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:58,805
We need to have
the conversation.

1286
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:00,840
Our governments cannot.

1287
01:28:05,846 --> 01:28:08,515
I will ask Moscow.

1288
01:28:08,548 --> 01:28:10,548
Who knows, what they will say.

1289
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:13,787
There are many people,
Mr. Donovan.

1290
01:28:13,820 --> 01:28:17,925
Who does not want this
exchange ever takes place.

1291
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,399
Can you come back tomorrow
to discuss their answer?

1292
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:25,432
Powers for Abel.

1293
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,934
And, Frederic Pryor.

1294
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:28,469
As I said...

1295
01:28:28,502 --> 01:28:30,671
Pryor is in the hands
of the organs...

1296
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:32,907
State Security of the
German Democratic Republic.

1297
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:35,510
I am confident. You can
make arrangements.

1298
01:28:35,542 --> 01:28:37,845
I am merely a secretary.

1299
01:28:37,878 --> 01:28:39,579
In the embassy of
foreign Powers.

1300
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:40,948
Okay.

1301
01:28:40,981 --> 01:28:44,585
You have to see Mr. Vogel.
I will give you his address.

1302
01:28:44,618 --> 01:28:46,554
There actually is a Mr. Vogel?

1303
01:28:46,587 --> 01:28:48,855
Why would you
imagine otherwise?

1304
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:50,890
It is a short cab ride.

1305
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:54,828
Please, Mr. Donovan...

1306
01:28:54,862 --> 01:28:56,862
Wear an overcoat
in this weather.

1307
01:28:58,498 --> 01:29:00,498
I had my stolen from me.

1308
01:29:01,034 --> 01:29:02,703
What do you expect?

1309
01:29:02,737 --> 01:29:04,737
It was from Saks Fifth Avenue.

1310
01:29:05,907 --> 01:29:07,907
Was not it?

1311
01:29:15,649 --> 01:29:16,984
<i>Mr. Donovan.</i>

1312
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,453
Mr. Vogel.

1313
01:29:18,485 --> 01:29:21,185
<i>- Please, come in.
- Ok.</i>

1314
01:29:24,958 --> 01:29:26,958
Sorry about the embassy.

1315
01:29:28,796 --> 01:29:30,796
The Soviets decided
not to host me.

1316
01:29:32,533 --> 01:29:34,435
That is very irritating.

1317
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,770
I am still trying to
grasp each party is...

1318
01:29:37,738 --> 01:29:39,506
Status?

1319
01:29:39,539 --> 01:29:42,643
Yes. And, interest
in the proceedings.

1320
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:45,712
It is a new world.

1321
01:29:45,747 --> 01:29:47,782
All are very disorienting.
Is not it?

1322
01:29:58,091 --> 01:30:00,091
Let me tell you what
I have to offer.

1323
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:04,532
I am a good friend...

1324
01:30:04,564 --> 01:30:06,600
- "Friend."
- No, he is older.

1325
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,536
"Protege"?

1326
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,037
Of the attorney general of the
German Democratic Republic.

1327
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,072
Sit down, please.

1328
01:30:15,676 --> 01:30:17,545
This is unfortunate.

1329
01:30:17,578 --> 01:30:19,780
Frederic Pryor.

1330
01:30:19,814 --> 01:30:22,317
He was in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

1331
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:25,819
But every accident,
properly viewed...

1332
01:30:25,853 --> 01:30:27,954
Is an opportunity?
Is not it, Mr. Donovan?

1333
01:30:27,988 --> 01:30:30,957
Your country refuses
to recognize.

1334
01:30:30,992 --> 01:30:33,661
The German
Democratic Republic.

1335
01:30:33,694 --> 01:30:35,695
They prefer to
make up stories.

1336
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:37,729
That the G.D.R does not
exist, for instance.

1337
01:30:39,699 --> 01:30:41,699
Sorry.

1338
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,104
As a means of forcing your
Government's recognition...

1339
01:30:44,137 --> 01:30:46,673
this real place. Sir.

1340
01:30:46,707 --> 01:30:48,576
In which you find yourself...

1341
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,077
The G.D.R.

1342
01:30:50,110 --> 01:30:52,579
The attorney general is happy
to negotiate with you.

1343
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,849
As a representative
of your government.

1344
01:30:54,881 --> 01:30:56,117
For Mr. Pryor return.

1345
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:57,717
Mr. Vogel, I am not here.

1346
01:30:57,752 --> 01:30:59,787
As a representative
of my government.

1347
01:31:02,856 --> 01:31:04,856
All right!

1348
01:31:06,860 --> 01:31:09,029
I think that is childish,
Mr. Donovan.

1349
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,698
I have no official status.

1350
01:31:11,731 --> 01:31:13,100
Fine.

1351
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:15,936
You do not represent the USA.
I do not represent the G.D.R.

1352
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:18,604
My client is Lydia
Abel, Rudolf's wife.

1353
01:31:18,738 --> 01:31:19,739
And, I have...

1354
01:31:19,774 --> 01:31:21,842
Lydia is the daughter.
Helen is the wife.

1355
01:31:27,782 --> 01:31:29,782
Well...

1356
01:31:30,685 --> 01:31:32,086
I am prepared to offer...

1357
01:31:32,118 --> 01:31:34,988
Frederic Pryor in exchange
for Rudolf Abel.

1358
01:31:36,724 --> 01:31:38,024
Then let us be clear.

1359
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:40,161
We will produce Rudolf Abel.

1360
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:43,564
You will produce, at the same
time, the student, Pryor.

1361
01:31:44,097 --> 01:31:45,600
At the same time?

1362
01:31:45,632 --> 01:31:47,068
Absolutely.

1363
01:31:47,100 --> 01:31:51,671
The exchange on offer is a
Russian at the end of his life.

1364
01:31:53,975 --> 01:31:56,743
For an American student
at the start of his.

1365
01:32:03,684 --> 01:32:06,654
Schischkin? He is not a
secretary of embassy.

1366
01:32:06,686 --> 01:32:09,657
Ivan Schischkin is the chief
of KGB in western Europe.

1367
01:32:09,689 --> 01:32:10,992
Whatever he is...

1368
01:32:11,024 --> 01:32:13,927
He is relaying our
proposal to Moscow.

1369
01:32:15,762 --> 01:32:16,930
And, they will decide.

1370
01:32:16,963 --> 01:32:19,734
Can I borrow your coat?
I lost mine.

1371
01:32:19,766 --> 01:32:21,202
How did you lose your coat?

1372
01:32:21,234 --> 01:32:23,234
You know, spy stuff.

1373
01:32:25,706 --> 01:32:28,708
- I will get you another coat.
- Good, because...

1374
01:32:28,743 --> 01:32:30,912
Who is...? Who is this Vogel?

1375
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,613
He... We do not know.

1376
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:35,917
He might be what
you said he is.

1377
01:32:35,949 --> 01:32:37,184
Friend of the
attorney general.

1378
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:40,921
Just some person the G.D.R
tapped to handle this.

1379
01:32:40,954 --> 01:32:42,856
Sounds like the East Germans...

1380
01:32:42,890 --> 01:32:45,626
are fighting for a
place at our table.

1381
01:32:45,659 --> 01:32:48,695
<i>The G.D.R gets Abel back
for the Russians...</i>

1382
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:49,896
winning their respect...

1383
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:52,699
capturing the headlines
for their cause.

1384
01:32:52,733 --> 01:32:54,969
Which puts the East Germany
on the map.

1385
01:32:55,002 --> 01:32:57,704
We do not care
about their map.

1386
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,206
Stick to the Russians.

1387
01:32:59,239 --> 01:33:01,841
Stick to the Russians.
It is Powers for Abel.

1388
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:05,011
What does all mean?
This might actually happen.

1389
01:33:05,046 --> 01:33:06,913
Yeah. That is what you
seem to be telling me.

1390
01:33:06,948 --> 01:33:09,984
We will put Abel on a plane.
He will be here Friday.

1391
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:12,019
So, if Schischkin gets the okay.

1392
01:33:12,052 --> 01:33:14,220
All that is the mechanics
of the trade.

1393
01:33:14,255 --> 01:33:16,090
How we swap our person
for their person.

1394
01:33:16,122 --> 01:33:18,225
Our "guys." Two people.

1395
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,728
Powers and Pryor.

1396
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:23,698
No. Now do not go
bleeding heart on me.

1397
01:33:23,730 --> 01:33:25,932
Powers is the whole ball game.

1398
01:33:25,966 --> 01:33:27,734
Forget this Ivy League boy.

1399
01:33:27,768 --> 01:33:29,869
Obviously it was a good idea.

1400
01:33:29,904 --> 01:33:32,273
To study Soviet
Economics in Berlin.

1401
01:33:32,305 --> 01:33:34,305
In the middle of the Cold War.

1402
01:33:35,775 --> 01:33:37,775
Powers is whom we need.

1403
01:33:38,145 --> 01:33:40,145
You do not even like Powers.

1404
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:43,884
Everybody hates Powers.

1405
01:33:43,917 --> 01:33:48,122
He did not kill himself and he let
the commies parade on television.

1406
01:33:48,154 --> 01:33:50,690
He is the most hated
man in America.

1407
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:53,226
After Rudolf Abel, maybe.

1408
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,260
And me.

1409
01:34:03,938 --> 01:34:05,938
Now wake up! Come out.

1410
01:34:14,047 --> 01:34:15,916
I have to sleep.

1411
01:34:15,949 --> 01:34:17,949
I just have to sleep.

1412
01:34:20,954 --> 01:34:22,122
I told you could sleep.

1413
01:34:22,155 --> 01:34:23,990
Once we talk what
need to talk.

1414
01:34:24,024 --> 01:34:26,860
You must focus on me.

1415
01:34:26,894 --> 01:34:29,262
Your government does not care
about you. You know that.

1416
01:34:29,296 --> 01:34:30,497
Any of you.

1417
01:34:30,530 --> 01:34:34,201
You know that 12 U-2 pilots
incurred brain damage.

1418
01:34:34,234 --> 01:34:37,805
They are vegetables because of
altitude, insufficient oxygen.

1419
01:34:37,837 --> 01:34:39,806
<i>They keep you flying, Gary.</i>

1420
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,908
<i>You and your friends.</i>

1421
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:45,345
They gave you this,
a scratchier.

1422
01:34:45,378 --> 01:34:48,149
Potassium Cyanide.

1423
01:34:48,181 --> 01:34:51,118
Does that look like
they care about you?

1424
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:23,783
What is the construction
of the destructor unit?

1425
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,853
What means is this
unit working?

1426
01:35:25,886 --> 01:35:28,988
With what explosives
the unit charges.

1427
01:35:29,023 --> 01:35:31,023
What destruction
is it capable?

1428
01:35:31,425 --> 01:35:33,394
I do not know.

1429
01:35:33,426 --> 01:35:35,829
They never showed any of the
equipment to the pilots.

1430
01:35:35,863 --> 01:35:38,131
How far can the radar hide?

1431
01:35:38,164 --> 01:35:40,067
An area on map during flight.

1432
01:35:40,100 --> 01:35:41,101
I do not know! I do not know!

1433
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:45,105
And you were making the
flight on April 9?

1434
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:47,841
On the industrial area
and MIR bomber base.

1435
01:35:47,875 --> 01:35:48,943
At Baranovichi.

1436
01:35:48,975 --> 01:35:50,877
I was not.

1437
01:35:50,911 --> 01:35:52,179
This was my first flight.

1438
01:35:52,412 --> 01:35:56,250
I need to know about of
engine out glide to the ratio.

1439
01:35:56,283 --> 01:35:59,319
How the plane gets so high.

1440
01:35:59,353 --> 01:36:04,291
We know it reaches
altitude of 70,000 feet.

1441
01:36:04,324 --> 01:36:06,260
Gary, we know this.

1442
01:36:06,292 --> 01:36:08,895
I need to know where
the planes have flown.

1443
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:11,297
Where they have flown, Gary.

1444
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:13,332
We must have this talk now.

1445
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:18,139
Now.

1446
01:36:18,171 --> 01:36:20,841
Then you can sleep a little.

1447
01:36:25,045 --> 01:36:27,045
<i>Sir, wake up.</i>

1448
01:36:28,282 --> 01:36:30,282
Wake up, Sir.

1449
01:36:32,153 --> 01:36:34,121
- Sir, can you come with me, please?
- Yeah.

1450
01:36:34,154 --> 01:36:36,189
- We have to move.
- Yeah, of course!

1451
01:36:36,222 --> 01:36:37,457
- Can you come with me, please?
- Yeah.

1452
01:36:37,490 --> 01:36:39,490
Okay.

1453
01:36:40,127 --> 01:36:41,929
Take your glasses.

1454
01:36:41,962 --> 01:36:45,198
- What time is it?
- It is late but, we need to talk.

1455
01:36:45,231 --> 01:36:47,231
We need that you get
in a plane, okay?

1456
01:36:48,068 --> 01:36:50,171
Yeah. Upsy-daisy!

1457
01:36:50,203 --> 01:36:52,105
- Upsy-daisy.
- That is right.

1458
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,407
There we go. Keep moving.

1459
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:55,439
Thank you.

1460
01:36:57,177 --> 01:36:58,878
Other way, other way.

1461
01:36:58,912 --> 01:36:59,947
There we go.

1462
01:36:59,979 --> 01:37:01,215
You say a plane.

1463
01:37:01,247 --> 01:37:03,117
This way, please. Keep moving.

1464
01:37:03,149 --> 01:37:06,119
<i>So, I received a
favorable decision.</i>

1465
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,221
<i>From Moscow on your proposal.</i>

1466
01:37:08,255 --> 01:37:11,225
<i>That we help our friends in the
German Democratic Republic.</i>

1467
01:37:11,492 --> 01:37:13,260
By exchanging.

1468
01:37:13,293 --> 01:37:15,293
Mr. Powers for Mr. Abel.

1469
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:18,498
That is well.

1470
01:37:18,532 --> 01:37:23,103
May I suggest the Glienicke
Bridge as a place of exchange?

1471
01:37:23,136 --> 01:37:24,404
Why not Checkpoint Charlie?

1472
01:37:24,438 --> 01:37:27,106
We are not looking
for publicity.

1473
01:37:27,140 --> 01:37:29,076
The Glienicke Bridge
is very quiet.

1474
01:37:29,109 --> 01:37:30,377
Especially early
in the morning.

1475
01:37:30,411 --> 01:37:33,180
Glienicke Bridge.
I will run to our side.

1476
01:37:33,213 --> 01:37:34,981
We can have Abel
here on Friday.

1477
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:36,317
So, Saturday morning.

1478
01:37:36,350 --> 01:37:38,385
Always impatience, yeah.

1479
01:37:38,418 --> 01:37:40,054
I want to get home,
go into my bed.

1480
01:37:40,087 --> 01:37:42,355
So, Saturday morning.

1481
01:37:42,389 --> 01:37:43,990
5:30 p.m.

1482
01:37:44,024 --> 01:37:45,525
All right!

1483
01:37:45,559 --> 01:37:47,261
We have done here.

1484
01:37:47,293 --> 01:37:48,529
This is a number.

1485
01:37:48,561 --> 01:37:51,998
In case, anything
should come up.

1486
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,132
All right!

1487
01:37:53,167 --> 01:37:55,167
Someone will answer
at any hour.

1488
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:58,203
I do not expect to use it.

1489
01:37:59,105 --> 01:38:01,408
Shall we toast
the arrangement?

1490
01:38:01,442 --> 01:38:03,442
Why not?

1491
01:38:04,578 --> 01:38:06,113
Armenian Brandy.

1492
01:38:06,145 --> 01:38:08,145
- Good for your cold.
- Thank you.

1493
01:38:09,082 --> 01:38:10,283
Would you mind...?

1494
01:38:10,317 --> 01:38:12,152
This is not part
of our business.

1495
01:38:12,185 --> 01:38:14,421
I would like to ask you
a couple of questions.

1496
01:38:14,454 --> 01:38:16,155
You do not have to answer.

1497
01:38:16,189 --> 01:38:18,189
I have the answer what I know.

1498
01:38:18,391 --> 01:38:21,427
I like this person,
your person.

1499
01:38:21,462 --> 01:38:24,364
What happens to your person.
When he gets home.

1500
01:38:24,398 --> 01:38:26,399
We have to make a
determination.

1501
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:29,103
Whether our person
is now your person.

1502
01:38:29,136 --> 01:38:31,005
Now, as I said to you before...

1503
01:38:31,037 --> 01:38:32,273
He has acted honorably.

1504
01:38:32,305 --> 01:38:34,041
He is still your person,
believe me.

1505
01:38:34,073 --> 01:38:37,043
Of course! You will
say if it were true.

1506
01:38:37,077 --> 01:38:39,279
If it were not true.

1507
01:38:39,313 --> 01:38:41,582
I guess it has come down.

1508
01:38:41,614 --> 01:38:43,317
Well, forgive me for pushing.

1509
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:46,185
But is he in any danger?

1510
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,521
If the determination is made.

1511
01:38:48,555 --> 01:38:50,990
Well, goodness.

1512
01:38:51,024 --> 01:38:53,594
As things are now,
everyone is in danger.

1513
01:38:53,627 --> 01:38:55,627
Cheers.

1514
01:39:09,342 --> 01:39:11,342
There will be no exchange
on Glienicke Bridge.

1515
01:39:12,378 --> 01:39:14,314
Excuse me, Sir.

1516
01:39:14,347 --> 01:39:16,382
There will be no exchange.

1517
01:39:17,251 --> 01:39:19,118
Not for Frederic Pryor.

1518
01:39:19,153 --> 01:39:22,256
Mr. Vogel, I thought
yesterday we have agreed.

1519
01:39:22,288 --> 01:39:24,524
We agreed on an exchange,
Abel for Pryor.

1520
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,395
Now I learn, you are
a rug merchant.

1521
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:32,298
Selling the same rug
to two customers.

1522
01:39:32,332 --> 01:39:35,202
- Abel for Pryor you sell to us.
- Yeah.

1523
01:39:35,234 --> 01:39:37,438
Abel for Powers you
sell to the Soviets.

1524
01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:40,106
I am not very sure,
the problem is...

1525
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,144
If the arrangement satisfies
two parties, three, or four.

1526
01:39:43,277 --> 01:39:44,411
What difference does make?

1527
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:46,545
The arrangement does
not satisfy this part.

1528
01:39:51,104 --> 01:39:53,104
Now, Mr. Vogel, please...

1529
01:39:53,153 --> 01:39:56,389
Obviously, you do not know
who with you are dealing.

1530
01:39:57,457 --> 01:40:00,094
The interest of the German
Democratic Republic.

1531
01:40:01,395 --> 01:40:02,595
To deal with...

1532
01:40:02,628 --> 01:40:05,498
Is it seems dealing with
another sovereign power?

1533
01:40:05,532 --> 01:40:07,167
The United States.

1534
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:09,269
An equal power.

1535
01:40:09,302 --> 01:40:10,671
Instead, you treat
us as stooges.

1536
01:40:10,703 --> 01:40:12,672
For the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

1537
01:40:12,706 --> 01:40:15,109
Can we just call them the
Russians? It will save time.

1538
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,545
I have an appointment, Sir.

1539
01:40:18,578 --> 01:40:20,346
I think you are wasting time.

1540
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:22,416
Now, tell me if I am
describing this wrong.

1541
01:40:22,448 --> 01:40:24,184
You have a kid, a
university student.

1542
01:40:24,217 --> 01:40:25,551
Someone knows he is not a spy.

1543
01:40:25,586 --> 01:40:27,087
Who have not threat to you?

1544
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:28,555
In exchange for this person.

1545
01:40:28,588 --> 01:40:30,323
Who is worthless to you?

1546
01:40:30,356 --> 01:40:32,525
You play an equal
part in an exchange.

1547
01:40:32,559 --> 01:40:34,627
Between the Russians
and, the Americans.

1548
01:40:34,661 --> 01:40:39,166
And this is one transaction
between two of you and us.

1549
01:40:39,198 --> 01:40:40,634
We are not trying to do
two things here, Sir.

1550
01:40:40,667 --> 01:40:42,368
We are just doing one thing.
One, one, one.

1551
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:47,474
It is hard for me to see, how the Republic
of East German Democrats has been slighted.

1552
01:40:47,507 --> 01:40:50,377
You agreed with the Soviets
without consulting me.

1553
01:40:50,411 --> 01:40:52,345
Is this a negotiation
or a conspiracy?

1554
01:40:52,378 --> 01:40:53,279
For it to be a conspiracy...

1555
01:40:53,313 --> 01:40:54,480
There would have to
be harm to you, Sir.

1556
01:40:54,515 --> 01:40:57,451
There are just benefits here.
We are of agreeing interests.

1557
01:40:57,484 --> 01:40:59,484
No. You decide they agree.

1558
01:41:00,421 --> 01:41:02,155
Where is your
appointment, sir?

1559
01:41:02,189 --> 01:41:03,590
In the West.

1560
01:41:03,623 --> 01:41:05,623
Good.

1561
01:41:15,769 --> 01:41:16,936
<i>Look around you.</i>

1562
01:41:16,970 --> 01:41:20,474
How does the Eastern sector
to compare the West?

1563
01:41:22,509 --> 01:41:24,478
Our Russian friends
have decided that...

1564
01:41:24,511 --> 01:41:26,511
We should not rebuild
our capital city.

1565
01:41:28,715 --> 01:41:32,219
We live in this ruin made
by our Russian friends.

1566
01:41:32,252 --> 01:41:34,252
Go ahead. Make your deal
with these Russians.

1567
01:41:34,753 --> 01:41:36,753
We will not be part of it.

1568
01:41:38,323 --> 01:41:39,524
There is no deal
without Pryor.

1569
01:41:39,658 --> 01:41:40,626
We are not leaving him here.

1570
01:41:40,760 --> 01:41:41,761
Is this your position
or of your government?

1571
01:41:41,795 --> 01:41:45,565
Sir, I am here.
I am talking to you.

1572
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:47,533
You are not a representative
of your government.

1573
01:41:47,568 --> 01:41:50,270
They do not know who you are.
Neither do we.

1574
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:52,605
You should be careful. This
is not Brooklyn, Mr. Donovan.

1575
01:42:00,279 --> 01:42:01,681
Look, Sir.

1576
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:03,550
You must know every
respect that matters.

1577
01:42:03,583 --> 01:42:05,583
I represent my government.

1578
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:07,786
You know who I am.

1579
01:42:08,421 --> 01:42:10,421
Do I know?

1580
01:42:31,545 --> 01:42:34,381
Do you have the proper papers?

1581
01:42:34,413 --> 01:42:37,283
Of course not. It
does not matter.

1582
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:38,484
An American lawyer like you.

1583
01:42:38,519 --> 01:42:40,287
Can talk your way of anything?

1584
01:42:40,319 --> 01:42:42,319
Cannot you?

1585
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:26,265
You go with him. Sir.

1586
01:43:26,300 --> 01:43:28,801
- Why?
- It is passport problem.

1587
01:43:28,835 --> 01:43:30,104
What... What is the problem?
What is the problem?

1588
01:43:30,436 --> 01:43:34,436
- You go with him.
- Sir. Come with us.

1589
01:43:34,541 --> 01:43:35,876
And, remember...

1590
01:43:35,908 --> 01:43:37,908
We control the fate
of Frederic Pryor.

1591
01:45:22,548 --> 01:45:24,548
My God!

1592
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,654
Yeah. I will start with
some coffee, please.

1593
01:46:01,688 --> 01:46:03,856
Then I will have
the Hilton Combo.

1594
01:46:03,890 --> 01:46:05,725
The American breakfast.

1595
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:06,859
And, coffee.

1596
01:46:06,893 --> 01:46:07,961
Both breakfasts?

1597
01:46:07,993 --> 01:46:09,529
Yeah, yeah.

1598
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:10,764
One first or...

1599
01:46:10,796 --> 01:46:12,498
Both first, both.
When they are ready.

1600
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:14,532
And, coffee.

1601
01:46:32,085 --> 01:46:33,854
You should not be here.

1602
01:46:33,886 --> 01:46:35,055
Well, sometimes in Germany.

1603
01:46:35,087 --> 01:46:37,087
You just want a big
American breakfast.

1604
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:43,063
What happened?
Where were you last night?

1605
01:46:43,095 --> 01:46:46,065
Vogel arranged for me to
spend some time in the East.

1606
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:47,667
Jesus!

1607
01:46:47,701 --> 01:46:48,935
Frankly, it is not
that much worse.

1608
01:46:48,969 --> 01:46:50,969
Than where you have
me here in the West.

1609
01:46:52,872 --> 01:46:56,542
The Russians are fine
with the exchange.

1610
01:46:56,576 --> 01:46:59,078
Now Vogel is saying that the
East Germans will not do it.

1611
01:46:59,112 --> 01:47:01,112
We are not going to get Pryor.

1612
01:47:01,515 --> 01:47:03,516
Great. Good.

1613
01:47:03,550 --> 01:47:05,551
So, the Soviets are set.
We get Powers.

1614
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:06,853
We get Powers.

1615
01:47:06,886 --> 01:47:08,889
Well done!

1616
01:47:08,921 --> 01:47:10,957
No. The East Germans
will not do it.

1617
01:47:10,990 --> 01:47:13,092
We will not get Pryor,
and that kid matters.

1618
01:47:13,126 --> 01:47:14,828
Every person matters.

1619
01:47:14,860 --> 01:47:17,898
Sure. That is why you tried.
That is why you tried.

1620
01:47:17,930 --> 01:47:19,966
Abel is on his way, so we are
all set for tomorrow morning.

1621
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,569
- Wait a minute.
- Makes the things simple.

1622
01:47:22,601 --> 01:47:24,871
We are not getting the kid.

1623
01:47:24,904 --> 01:47:27,039
Yeah. I understand.
We are set.

1624
01:47:27,073 --> 01:47:29,073
We can ignore the message.
We got this morning.

1625
01:47:30,676 --> 01:47:31,912
What is message?

1626
01:47:31,944 --> 01:47:33,078
From the East Germans.

1627
01:47:33,113 --> 01:47:35,047
They called the number.
I gave you.

1628
01:47:35,081 --> 01:47:37,583
They said that wanted
to speak to you today.

1629
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:39,586
- Vogel called.
- No.

1630
01:47:39,618 --> 01:47:41,954
An Officer of Harold Ott.

1631
01:47:41,988 --> 01:47:43,556
East German attorney general.

1632
01:47:43,590 --> 01:47:45,057
What does he want?
What does he want?

1633
01:47:45,091 --> 01:47:46,193
Well, to talk to you.

1634
01:47:46,225 --> 01:47:49,128
It is ok. I cannot ask
you to go back there.

1635
01:47:49,162 --> 01:47:51,765
Listen, you seem to be a persona
non grata to some elements.

1636
01:47:51,997 --> 01:47:53,099
We will not push our luck.

1637
01:47:53,132 --> 01:47:55,135
So, he wants to see me.

1638
01:47:55,167 --> 01:47:56,103
What time?

1639
01:47:57,136 --> 01:48:00,073
No. No. Now, listen. You... You...

1640
01:48:00,105 --> 01:48:02,141
You... You do not need to go.
In fact you should not go.

1641
01:48:02,175 --> 01:48:04,610
In fact, you cannot go.

1642
01:48:04,644 --> 01:48:06,979
We set with the Soviets.
We do not want to screw it up.

1643
01:48:07,012 --> 01:48:08,948
- I am not going to screw it up.
- You are not going!

1644
01:48:08,981 --> 01:48:10,550
Do not be a pain in the ass.

1645
01:48:10,583 --> 01:48:11,952
I ordered.

1646
01:48:11,984 --> 01:48:14,054
Enjoy your big
American breakfast.

1647
01:48:23,796 --> 01:48:25,731
I thought it should be negotiated.

1648
01:48:25,765 --> 01:48:27,967
At the highest level
as a courtesy to you.

1649
01:48:28,001 --> 01:48:30,001
Thank you, Sir.

1650
01:48:32,037 --> 01:48:34,908
I do not know how things
became so confused.

1651
01:48:34,940 --> 01:48:37,743
Well! I guess sometimes
they just became.

1652
01:48:42,215 --> 01:48:43,817
For sake of clarity.

1653
01:48:43,850 --> 01:48:46,185
I say, we are fully
prepared to exchange.

1654
01:48:46,219 --> 01:48:50,923
They called student
Pryor, for Rudolf Abel.

1655
01:48:50,957 --> 01:48:53,792
I understand Mr. Vogel that
Pryor is very important to you.

1656
01:48:53,827 --> 01:48:55,194
Yes, but...

1657
01:48:55,228 --> 01:48:57,796
We will do a memorandum
to that effect.

1658
01:48:59,164 --> 01:49:01,100
A memorandum.

1659
01:49:01,134 --> 01:49:04,604
Certainly, we commit a
bi-lateral exchange.

1660
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:10,676
Yes, yes, sure. I am not sure.
What that means but...

1661
01:49:10,710 --> 01:49:15,081
My country also insists
on Francis Gary Powers.

1662
01:49:15,114 --> 01:49:17,114
No!

1663
01:49:21,253 --> 01:49:24,925
This is how things
became so confused.

1664
01:49:24,957 --> 01:49:27,694
Powers. What use is he, Sir?

1665
01:49:27,726 --> 01:49:29,628
You want him back for
punitive reasons.

1666
01:49:29,662 --> 01:49:30,863
What has done has done.

1667
01:49:30,896 --> 01:49:32,198
He has divulged. What
will he divulge?

1668
01:49:32,231 --> 01:49:35,034
As no doubt, Abel has also.

1669
01:49:35,068 --> 01:49:39,838
We are offering instead someone,
whom you insist is innocent.

1670
01:49:39,872 --> 01:49:41,173
And, this is right.

1671
01:49:41,207 --> 01:49:43,207
This is whom you
should retrieve.

1672
01:49:43,275 --> 01:49:44,911
The future.

1673
01:49:44,944 --> 01:49:46,944
Look to the future.

1674
01:50:04,163 --> 01:50:06,166
I am sorry. Could you
give me a moment, Sir?

1675
01:50:26,152 --> 01:50:28,287
I am very sorry, Sir.
The attorney general regrets.

1676
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:30,990
That he had to leave
on urgent business.

1677
01:50:31,024 --> 01:50:34,260
- He left.
- Yes. Many apologies.

1678
01:50:34,293 --> 01:50:36,695
I have been waiting
for him over an hour.

1679
01:50:36,729 --> 01:50:38,729
Very sorry, Sir.

1680
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,300
Young man?

1681
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:45,936
Come here.

1682
01:50:46,805 --> 01:50:48,805
It is all right! Come here.

1683
01:50:54,779 --> 01:50:56,779
Take a seat.

1684
01:50:58,083 --> 01:51:00,083
Come on! Come on! Sit down.

1685
01:51:04,224 --> 01:51:06,224
Do you like your job here?

1686
01:51:06,826 --> 01:51:08,194
It is a very good job, Sir.

1687
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,329
It must be...
It must be interesting.

1688
01:51:10,363 --> 01:51:11,797
Yes, Sir.

1689
01:51:11,831 --> 01:51:13,932
And, important too.

1690
01:51:13,966 --> 01:51:16,935
Your English is... Is good.

1691
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:18,971
Yes. I hesitate to
say it is excellent.

1692
01:51:19,005 --> 01:51:19,872
It is excellent, Sir.

1693
01:51:19,905 --> 01:51:21,940
Good, good. Good.

1694
01:51:21,975 --> 01:51:24,877
I just lost my
negotiating partner.

1695
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:26,945
And, I need somebody to talk.

1696
01:51:26,979 --> 01:51:28,979
You seem like a
reasonable young man.

1697
01:51:30,216 --> 01:51:32,216
Can I talk to you?

1698
01:51:35,020 --> 01:51:36,256
It is all right!

1699
01:51:36,288 --> 01:51:38,288
It is all right! I just...

1700
01:51:40,159 --> 01:51:42,228
I just need you to give
a message to your boss.

1701
01:51:44,797 --> 01:51:46,797
It has to be very,
very, very clear.

1702
01:51:47,833 --> 01:51:49,833
Do you understand?

1703
01:51:50,170 --> 01:51:53,305
Yes, Sir. But perhaps you
should wait until him.

1704
01:51:53,338 --> 01:51:56,810
No, no. The thing is. I have this
cold and I want to get home.

1705
01:51:57,342 --> 01:51:59,342
And, get in bed.

1706
01:52:00,979 --> 01:52:02,381
Can you give him the message?

1707
01:52:02,414 --> 01:52:04,414
Certainly.

1708
01:52:05,819 --> 01:52:07,819
This is the message.

1709
01:52:09,154 --> 01:52:11,824
There is no deal for Abel
unless we get Powers and Pryor.

1710
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:15,828
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Sir.

1711
01:52:15,862 --> 01:52:17,029
It arranged for
tomorrow morning.

1712
01:52:17,162 --> 01:52:19,399
It will not happen,
unless we get two men.

1713
01:52:19,431 --> 01:52:21,134
Those two men.

1714
01:52:21,167 --> 01:52:23,167
- Two, two, two.
- Yes. Sir.

1715
01:52:23,336 --> 01:52:26,206
- Yes.
- If there is no deal.

1716
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:28,238
Your boss must
tell the Soviets.

1717
01:52:29,408 --> 01:52:31,144
He has to tell the Soviets.

1718
01:52:31,176 --> 01:52:33,212
They are not getting
Rudolf Abel.

1719
01:52:35,414 --> 01:52:37,414
Yes, Sir.

1720
01:52:40,052 --> 01:52:42,052
And, tell him this.

1721
01:52:43,088 --> 01:52:46,059
That so far, Abel has
been a good soldier.

1722
01:52:46,091 --> 01:52:48,161
But he thinks is going home.

1723
01:52:50,363 --> 01:52:52,966
If we have to tell him it,
he is not going home.

1724
01:52:52,998 --> 01:52:54,266
That the Soviets
do not want him.

1725
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,902
That he is never going home.

1726
01:52:55,935 --> 01:52:58,070
I imagine his behavior
might change.

1727
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:03,009
And who will be held
responsible for that?

1728
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,081
That is a long message.

1729
01:53:08,113 --> 01:53:10,149
Did you get it all?

1730
01:53:10,182 --> 01:53:12,351
- Yes, Sir. I got it.
- Good.

1731
01:53:14,020 --> 01:53:16,020
You are a good man.

1732
01:53:18,123 --> 01:53:19,859
Also, tell him...

1733
01:53:19,893 --> 01:53:21,060
There is no deal,
unless we hear...

1734
01:53:21,094 --> 01:53:22,929
before the end of
business today.

1735
01:53:22,962 --> 01:53:24,229
He has the number.

1736
01:53:24,264 --> 01:53:26,265
If the exchange is
not going to happen.

1737
01:53:26,298 --> 01:53:28,333
No reason for everybody
to get up in the morning.

1738
01:53:28,368 --> 01:53:32,070
No, Sir. That would
be pointless.

1739
01:53:32,104 --> 01:53:34,908
You are kidding me!
You are kidding me!

1740
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:37,109
Not really.
I need some change.

1741
01:53:37,143 --> 01:53:39,378
This is exactly what you
were not supposed to do.

1742
01:53:39,412 --> 01:53:42,215
My instructions were to
feel out the situation.

1743
01:53:42,247 --> 01:53:45,051
Your instructions were to
get Powers, not Pryor.

1744
01:53:45,083 --> 01:53:47,319
That was not the original
deal. You fouled it up!

1745
01:53:47,353 --> 01:53:49,988
How do you know?
I feel very good about it.

1746
01:53:50,023 --> 01:53:51,390
You fouled it up!

1747
01:53:51,423 --> 01:53:53,225
Do not worry.

1748
01:53:53,259 --> 01:53:55,360
I think it is
going to be fine.

1749
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:57,395
How do you know?
You do not know that.

1750
01:54:01,266 --> 01:54:03,368
United States. New
York, New York.

1751
01:54:06,005 --> 01:54:08,975
That whole thing...

1752
01:54:09,007 --> 01:54:11,911
Has me to feel out.

1753
01:54:11,944 --> 01:54:14,247
Would I swap one for one?
Which one?

1754
01:54:15,314 --> 01:54:17,283
I said: "No. Two for one."

1755
01:54:17,317 --> 01:54:19,252
They know where we stand.

1756
01:54:19,284 --> 01:54:21,284
Yeah, what if they think
about it and say...

1757
01:54:21,354 --> 01:54:23,488
Forget it! You keep our
person. We keep your people.

1758
01:54:26,426 --> 01:54:28,528
Well, then I have
fucked it all up.

1759
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:31,064
Hey, honey! It is me.

1760
01:54:31,096 --> 01:54:33,966
Yeah. The fishing
has been great.

1761
01:54:35,969 --> 01:54:37,302
I am in London.

1762
01:54:37,337 --> 01:54:39,377
Just for one more meeting.
Then I am on my way home.

1763
01:54:40,573 --> 01:54:44,042
Yeah, yeah, I remember
that marmalade.

1764
01:54:44,077 --> 01:54:46,179
It is that shop right
by Regent's Park.

1765
01:54:47,479 --> 01:54:49,414
All right! I will
if I have the time.

1766
01:54:49,448 --> 01:54:51,448
Can I say hi to Roger?

1767
01:54:52,452 --> 01:54:54,452
Could I say hi to the girls?

1768
01:54:55,054 --> 01:54:57,054
Is anyone not busy?

1769
01:54:57,422 --> 01:54:59,926
Have they even noticed
I am not around?

1770
01:55:56,215 --> 01:55:58,215
We are on...

1771
01:55:58,451 --> 01:56:00,451
Two for one.

1772
01:56:01,119 --> 01:56:02,088
Hot dog!

1773
01:56:03,122 --> 01:56:05,122
Let us have a drink.

1774
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:07,291
- One "wrinkle".
- What is that?

1775
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:10,529
They will not release Pryor
with Powers not on the bridge.

1776
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:12,297
They will release him
at the same time.

1777
01:56:12,332 --> 01:56:14,434
When the Russians give
us Powers on the bridge.

1778
01:56:14,466 --> 01:56:17,103
They will release Pryor
over Checkpoint Charlie.

1779
01:56:17,136 --> 01:56:18,637
What does that mean?

1780
01:56:18,671 --> 01:56:22,140
I think it means: We want
to have the last word.

1781
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:25,176
They will do it.

1782
01:56:25,278 --> 01:56:27,278
You tell me.
You felt them out.

1783
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:49,167
Where are they?

1784
01:56:49,202 --> 01:56:51,025
Where is our person?
Where is our person?

1785
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,171
They are late.

1786
01:56:52,204 --> 01:56:54,140
Nobody is late. We are early.

1787
01:56:54,172 --> 01:56:56,172
- May I?
- Yeah.

1788
01:57:02,582 --> 01:57:03,649
<i>Hoffman?</i>

1789
01:57:03,682 --> 01:57:04,917
<i>Yeah?</i>

1790
01:57:05,251 --> 01:57:06,685
<i>I think they have...</i>

1791
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:08,453
<i>What?</i>

1792
01:57:08,488 --> 01:57:10,355
Snipers.

1793
01:57:10,390 --> 01:57:12,390
I am sure they have.

1794
01:57:12,557 --> 01:57:14,557
How are you sure they have?

1795
01:57:14,726 --> 01:57:16,726
Because we have snipers.

1796
01:57:34,346 --> 01:57:36,346
Step out, Sir.

1797
01:57:43,756 --> 01:57:45,756
Jim.

1798
01:57:49,429 --> 01:57:51,429
Dear Jim.

1799
01:57:52,465 --> 01:57:54,465
How are you?

1800
01:57:55,234 --> 01:57:57,234
Happy to see you.

1801
01:57:57,436 --> 01:57:59,372
Had you arranged
all this for me?

1802
01:57:59,404 --> 01:58:02,207
Let us see what that is before,
I take credit for it.

1803
01:58:03,509 --> 01:58:05,509
Any word about Pryor
from Checkpoint Charlie?

1804
01:58:29,801 --> 01:58:31,801
Nothing get yet.

1805
01:58:38,243 --> 01:58:39,545
Excuse me, Sir.

1806
01:58:39,578 --> 01:58:41,713
This is Lieutenant Joe Murphy,
the United States Air Force...

1807
01:58:41,747 --> 01:58:43,747
Here to identify Powers.

1808
01:58:44,250 --> 01:58:45,318
Lieutenant Murphy.

1809
01:58:45,751 --> 01:58:47,751
Sir.

1810
01:58:50,422 --> 01:58:52,225
There may be a slight glitch.

1811
01:58:52,257 --> 01:58:54,393
I was a young man when I left.

1812
01:58:54,426 --> 01:58:56,462
Whom will they find
to identify me?

1813
01:58:57,697 --> 01:59:00,432
I hope it is not your
East German family.

1814
01:59:00,466 --> 01:59:02,466
I doubt they could
identify each other.

1815
01:59:37,470 --> 01:59:39,470
Looks like our part.

1816
01:59:46,511 --> 01:59:48,814
Well, let us go.

1817
01:59:48,847 --> 01:59:50,847
You can stay here, Donovan.

1818
01:59:51,650 --> 01:59:53,650
Not likely.

1819
01:59:55,354 --> 01:59:57,354
Open the gate.

1820
02:00:11,570 --> 02:00:13,570
What do you think will
happen, when you get home?

1821
02:00:14,306 --> 02:00:16,306
I think...

1822
02:00:16,641 --> 02:00:18,641
I have vodka.

1823
02:00:21,413 --> 02:00:22,480
Yeah.

1824
02:00:23,381 --> 02:00:24,649
Yeah.

1825
02:00:24,684 --> 02:00:27,485
Rudolf, is there not
the possibility...?

1826
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:29,588
That my people are
going to shoot me.

1827
02:00:30,789 --> 02:00:32,789
Yes.

1828
02:00:33,626 --> 02:00:35,694
- You are not worried.
- Would it help?

1829
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,810
The answer to your
question, my friend.

1830
02:00:50,842 --> 02:00:53,412
I acted honorably.
I think they know that.

1831
02:00:54,713 --> 02:00:56,582
But sometimes
people think wrong.

1832
02:00:56,615 --> 02:00:58,615
People are people.

1833
02:00:59,551 --> 02:01:01,551
Let us see how they greet me.

1834
02:01:02,755 --> 02:01:04,755
What for can I look?

1835
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:10,863
If I am embraced or just
shown the back seat.

1836
02:02:05,551 --> 02:02:07,551
<i>Take off the hat.</i>

1837
02:02:13,492 --> 02:02:15,492
Hey, Powers.

1838
02:02:16,494 --> 02:02:18,494
Hey, Murphy.

1839
02:02:19,631 --> 02:02:21,631
Yeah, that is Powers.

1840
02:02:23,703 --> 02:02:25,904
All right! Mr. Donovan.
We go now!

1841
02:02:25,938 --> 02:02:27,938
Hang on!

1842
02:02:34,680 --> 02:02:36,680
Believe me, I will tell you.

1843
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:40,050
There is no one here.

1844
02:02:42,921 --> 02:02:44,989
They will release another man
at Checkpoint Charlie.

1845
02:02:45,024 --> 02:02:47,025
We are just confirming
that he is there.

1846
02:02:47,059 --> 02:02:48,661
<i>Now!</i>

1847
02:02:48,694 --> 02:02:50,694
As per plan if you, please.

1848
02:02:52,596 --> 02:02:53,032
Let us go.

1849
02:02:53,265 --> 02:02:55,900
Pryor will show up or,
he will not. Let us go.

1850
02:02:55,935 --> 02:02:58,804
They are waiting to see, If
we will do it without him.

1851
02:02:58,837 --> 02:03:01,837
We just have to stand here.
Show them we will not.

1852
02:03:02,541 --> 02:03:03,676
I do not give a shit
what they want.

1853
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:06,011
We have our objective.
Go ahead, Abel.

1854
02:03:07,813 --> 02:03:10,682
<i>Go ahead, Sir. You can go.</i>

1855
02:03:10,716 --> 02:03:12,784
If it is not the plan,
we go home.

1856
02:03:12,818 --> 02:03:14,818
We exchange now,
or we go home!

1857
02:03:17,555 --> 02:03:19,759
- You are waiting for another man.
- Yes.

1858
02:03:20,826 --> 02:03:22,826
You want him, too.

1859
02:03:24,497 --> 02:03:25,730
I want him.

1860
02:03:25,765 --> 02:03:26,631
Does not matter
what he wants, Sir?

1861
02:03:26,966 --> 02:03:28,966
I am in charge, and
you are free to go.

1862
02:03:29,702 --> 02:03:31,702
Please go. Walk across.

1863
02:03:43,114 --> 02:03:45,114
I can wait.

1864
02:04:09,608 --> 02:04:11,976
It is something.
I am not sure yet.

1865
02:04:14,046 --> 02:04:16,046
Hang on!

1866
02:05:00,059 --> 02:05:02,059
Let us go.

1867
02:05:07,733 --> 02:05:09,733
We got him!

1868
02:05:09,935 --> 02:05:11,935
I...I am...

1869
02:05:13,738 --> 02:05:15,738
I sent you a gift, Jim.

1870
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:18,675
It is a... It is a painting.

1871
02:05:19,878 --> 02:05:21,913
I hope it has some
meaning to you.

1872
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,649
I am sorry. I did not
think to give you a gift.

1873
02:05:29,889 --> 02:05:31,889
This is your gift.

1874
02:05:35,094 --> 02:05:37,094
This is your gift.

1875
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:14,030
Are you okay?

1876
02:06:14,867 --> 02:06:16,867
Let us go, let us
go, and let us go!

1877
02:07:35,948 --> 02:07:37,916
Mr. Donovan?

1878
02:07:37,949 --> 02:07:39,949
Colonel Abel asked me
to give this to you.

1879
02:07:42,820 --> 02:07:44,820
Pardon me, Sir.

1880
02:07:45,791 --> 02:07:47,791
Were you in charge
of this thing, sir?

1881
02:07:48,761 --> 02:07:50,895
- Yeah.
- I have to thank you.

1882
02:07:51,796 --> 02:07:53,796
I have to thank somebody.

1883
02:08:10,248 --> 02:08:14,051
I gave them nothing.
I gave them nothing.

1884
02:08:14,252 --> 02:08:16,188
It does not matter.

1885
02:08:16,220 --> 02:08:18,823
It does not matter
what people think.

1886
02:08:18,856 --> 02:08:20,856
You know what you did.

1887
02:09:10,943 --> 02:09:12,943
Welcome home!

1888
02:09:14,345 --> 02:09:16,345
What a trip!

1889
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:29,359
Are you okay?

1890
02:09:29,394 --> 02:09:31,394
Yeah, I am fine.

1891
02:09:32,997 --> 02:09:35,000
- Did you get the marmalade?
- Yes, yes.

1892
02:09:35,033 --> 02:09:37,069
Yes. Yes.

1893
02:09:37,935 --> 02:09:39,935
I did.

1894
02:09:40,905 --> 02:09:42,905
As ordered.

1895
02:09:46,278 --> 02:09:48,278
Jim?

1896
02:09:48,380 --> 02:09:50,448
- This is from Arno's.
- So?

1897
02:09:50,481 --> 02:09:52,984
- On the corner!
- Well! Honey I was busy.

1898
02:09:53,018 --> 02:09:54,953
- Please. For God's sake.
- We were so busy.

1899
02:09:54,987 --> 02:09:56,387
- How is Roger? Is he home?
- He is home.

1900
02:09:56,421 --> 02:09:58,923
Carol is home, Peggy is home.
Everyone is home.

1901
02:09:58,957 --> 02:10:01,092
<i>Mom? Come quick! Look!</i>

1902
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:04,395
- Mom comes here!
- Mom comes here!

1903
02:10:04,429 --> 02:10:06,965
- Come see this! Look! Watch!
- Come on!

1904
02:10:06,998 --> 02:10:09,301
<i>Francis Gary Powers.</i>

1905
02:10:09,333 --> 02:10:13,271
<i>Released from prison
in the Soviet Union.</i>

1906
02:10:13,305 --> 02:10:15,373
<i>He turned over to
American authorities.</i>

1907
02:10:15,407 --> 02:10:18,277
<i>Early this morning in Berlin.</i>

1908
02:10:18,310 --> 02:10:23,081
<i>The President commuted
the sentence of Rudolf Abel.</i>

1909
02:10:23,114 --> 02:10:25,984
<i>Mr. Abel has deported.</i>

1910
02:10:26,018 --> 02:10:28,453
<i>He has released in Berlin.</i>

1911
02:10:28,487 --> 02:10:32,090
<i>Efforts to obtain Mr.
Powers released.</i>

1912
02:10:32,123 --> 02:10:34,926
<i>Had underway for some time.</i>

1913
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,461
<i>In recent efforts.</i>

1914
02:10:36,494 --> 02:10:38,497
<i>The United States
government has had...</i>

1915
02:10:38,529 --> 02:10:43,034
<i>The cooperation and assistance
of Mr. James B. Donovan.</i>

1916
02:10:43,068 --> 02:10:45,369
<i>A New York attorney.</i>

1917
02:10:45,404 --> 02:10:49,006
<i>Frederic L. Pryor,
an American student,</i>

1918
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:51,909
<i>held by East German
authorities,</i>

1919
02:10:51,944 --> 02:10:54,246
<i>since August of 1961.</i>

1920
02:10:54,279 --> 02:10:56,414
I thought Daddy was fishing.

1921
02:10:56,448 --> 02:10:58,448
Salmon.

1922
02:10:58,550 --> 02:11:02,020
<i>Abel now disappeared
into the communist world.</i>

1923
02:11:02,054 --> 02:11:04,288
<i>Powers is answering
questions here.</i>

1924
02:11:04,323 --> 02:11:07,125
<i>And Donovan have gone back
to his practice law.</i>

1925
02:11:07,158 --> 02:11:09,293
