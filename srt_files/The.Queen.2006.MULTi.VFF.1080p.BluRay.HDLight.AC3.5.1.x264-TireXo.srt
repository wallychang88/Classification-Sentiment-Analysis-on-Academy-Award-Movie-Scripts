1
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,833
<i>After weeks
of campaigning on the road,</i>

2
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>Tony Blair and his family
finally strolled</i>

3
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,458
<i>the few hundred yards
to the polling station</i>

4
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:45,208
<i>this election day morning.</i>

5
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,958
<i>Amongst the Labour faithful,
up and down the country,</i>

6
00:00:47,999 --> 00:00:51,124
<i>there is an enormous sense of pride
in Mr. Blair's achievements,</i>

7
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:52,416
and the confidence

8
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:56,083
<i>that he is about to become the
youngest prime minister this century.</i>

9
00:00:56,124 --> 00:00:59,083
- Have you voted yet, Mr. Crawford?
- Yes, ma'am.

10
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:03,333
I was there when they opened.
First in line. 7:00.

11
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,833
I don't mind telling you,

12
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:09,166
it wasn't for Mr. Blair.

13
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:12,541
- You're not a modernizer, then?
- Certainly not.

14
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:17,124
We're in danger of losing too much
that is good about this country as it is.

15
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,874
<i>There is
a growing sense of excitement.</i>

16
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:22,041
<i>This really could be
the beginning of a new...</i>

17
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,416
I envy you being able to vote.

18
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:27,458
Not the actual ticking of the box,
although it would be...

19
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,624
Well, it would be nice
to experience that once.

20
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,208
But the sheer joy of being partial.

21
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,791
Yes. Of course, one forgets that,
as sovereign,

22
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:41,333
- you're not entitled to vote.
- No.

23
00:01:41,583 --> 00:01:44,708
Still, you won't catch me feeling
sorry for you.

24
00:01:45,958 --> 00:01:48,833
You might not be allowed
to vote, ma'am,

25
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:54,083
But it is your government.

26
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:55,624
Yes.

27
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,291
I suppose that is some consolation.

28
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,791
Good morning.

29
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,124
- Shall I draw the curtains?
- Yes, please.

30
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,624
So, did you stay up all night?

31
00:03:10,874 --> 00:03:12,249
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,541
And was it as expected?

33
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,124
Yes, ma'am. Mr. Blair,

34
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,583
by a landslide.

35
00:03:23,124 --> 00:03:25,291
Oh, I see.

36
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:29,791
<i>They've stopped
the traffic completely</i>

37
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,749
<i>for Tony Blair's first day of power
in London.</i>

38
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:35,791
<i>You've got the ceremonial,
the tourists, the official,</i>

39
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,374
<i>and you've got a lovely summer's day.</i>

40
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:42,124
<i>Tony Blair waving to the crowds,
people waving to them there.</i>

41
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,791
<i>I guess most of them do know
it's the Prime Minister in waiting.</i>

42
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,249
<i>Lining the streets there.</i>

43
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,374
The Prime Minister's
on his way, ma'am.

44
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:57,624
To be, Robin. Prime Minister to be.

45
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,916
I haven't asked him yet.

46
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,958
He's a hard one to read, isn't he?

47
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:07,624
Yes. On the one hand,
his background is quite Establishment.

48
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,624
Father a Conservative,
educated at Fettes

49
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:13,499
where he was tutored by the same man
as the Prince of Wales.

50
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,124
Well, we'll try not to hold that
against him.

51
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:20,083
On the other, his manifesto promises
the most radical modernization

52
00:04:20,124 --> 00:04:23,208
and shake up of the constitution
in 300 years.

53
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,541
Do you think he's going to try
and modernize us?

54
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,124
Well, I wouldn't put it past him.

55
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,708
He's married to a woman with known
anti-monarchist sympathies.

56
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:33,708
You may remember her curtsy
the first time you met.

57
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,749
It could be described as "shallow".

58
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:42,416
I don't measure the depth of a curtsy,
Robin. I leave that to my sister.

59
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,083
And the atmosphere at Downing Street
is expected to be very informal.

60
00:04:46,124 --> 00:04:50,458
Everyone on first name terms
at the Prime Minister's insistence.

61
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,916
- What, as in, "Cal| me Tony"?
- Yes, ma'am.

62
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,958
Oh, I don't like that.

63
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:56,999
Have we sent him a protocol sheet?

64
00:05:06,999 --> 00:05:08,958
Funny, I'm actually rather nervous.

65
00:05:08,999 --> 00:05:11,083
Why?
You've met her often enough before.

66
00:05:11,124 --> 00:05:16,083
I know, but never one-to-one,
and never as Prime Minister.

67
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,083
Well, just remember,

68
00:05:18,124 --> 00:05:21,958
you're a man that's just been elected
by the whole nation.

69
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:26,666
But she's still, you know, the Queen.

70
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,541
The audience room is upstairs.

71
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,458
When we reach the audience room,
I will knock.

72
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,374
We will not wait to be called,
we shall go straight inside.

73
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:46,583
Standing by the door,
we bow from the neck.

74
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:49,624
I will introduce you,
the Queen will extend her hand.

75
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:54,166
You go to her, bow again,
then shake her hand.

76
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,624
Couple of other things.

77
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:02,124
It's "ma'am" as in "ham."
Not "ma'am" as in "farm."

78
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:07,833
And when you're in the presence,
at no point must you show your back.

79
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,249
- The "presence"?
- Yes, sir.

80
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:13,124
That's what it's called
when you're in Her Majesty's company.

81
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,708
Would you like to sit there, Mrs. Blair?

82
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,083
Mr. Blair, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,916
How nice to see you again, Mr. Blair.

84
00:06:39,624 --> 00:06:41,999
- And congratulations.
- Thank you, ma'am.

85
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,791
- Your children must be very proud.
- I hope so.

86
00:06:44,874 --> 00:06:46,791
- You've three, haven't you?
- That's right.

87
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:50,791
Oh, how lovely. Such a blessing,
children. Please, do sit down.

88
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,458
Thank you, ma'am.

89
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,749
Have we shown you how to start
a nuclear war yet?

90
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,249
No.

91
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:09,958
Oh, first thing we do, apparently.

92
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:11,541
Then we take away your passport

93
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:15,124
and spend the rest of the time
sending you around the world.

94
00:07:15,166 --> 00:07:17,124
You obviously know my job better
than I do.

95
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:20,624
Yes, well, you are
my tenth prime minister, Mr. Blair.

96
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,374
My first, of course,
was Winston Churchill.

97
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:27,124
He sat in your chair
in frock coat and top hat.

98
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:31,791
He was kind enough to give a shy
young girl like me quite an education.

99
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,291
I can imagine.

100
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,916
With time, one has hopefully added
experience to that education,

101
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:38,041
and a little wisdom.

102
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:42,166
Better enabling us to execute
our constitutional responsibility.

103
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,874
To advise, guide, and warn
the government of the day.

104
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,583
Advice which I look forward
to receiving.

105
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,791
Yes, well, we'll save that
for our weekly meetings.

106
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:59,874
If there's nothing else, I believe
we have some business to attend to.

107
00:08:01,374 --> 00:08:02,708
Of course.

108
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,583
Your Majesty,
my party has won the election,

109
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:10,291
and so I come now to ask your
permission to form a government.

110
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,624
No, Mr. Blair.
Mr. Blair, I ask the question.

111
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:18,416
The duty falls upon me,
as your sovereign,

112
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:23,041
to invite you to become Prime Minister
and to form a government in my name.

113
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,791
And if you agree,
the custom is to say, "Yes".

114
00:08:29,624 --> 00:08:30,958
Yes.

115
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,374
Mrs. Blair, how lovely to see you again.

116
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:59,124
And congratulations.
You must be very proud.

117
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,499
- Yes.
- And exhausted, I imagine.

118
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:03,916
Where will you
be spending the summer?

119
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,583
- France.
- Oh, lovely.

120
00:09:05,624 --> 00:09:06,904
You'll be in Balmoral, I expect.

121
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,916
Yes. Yes, |can't wait.
It's a wonderful place.

122
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:12,374
You know, my great,
great-grandmother Victoria said of it,

123
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:15,374
"In Balmoral, all seems to breathe
freedom and peace"

124
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,124
"and make one forget the world
and its sad turmoils."

125
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:20,624
- Your Majesty.
- Oh, excuse me.

126
00:09:23,249 --> 00:09:24,958
There's some
breaking news, Your Majesty.

127
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:26,124
Oh, really?

128
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,791
- Yes, we need to know how to respond.
- Oh, yes, of course.

129
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:34,416
I'm so sorry, we're going
to have to leave it there.

130
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:50,499
Not too short, was it? Fifteen minutes.
One doesn't want to be rude.

131
00:09:50,583 --> 00:09:51,583
No, ma'am.

132
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,708
Morning, sir.

133
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,916
"Thank you very much for coming.
Now fuck off."

134
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:02,249
- I know. What was all that about?
- God knows. Diana.

135
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:04,331
Whatever it is, it'll be something
to do with Diana.

136
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,583
<i>Princess Diana
embroiled in more controversy</i>

137
00:10:07,624 --> 00:10:10,291
<i>as she pulls out
of a meeting with MPs.</i>

138
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:12,124
<i>Princess Diana moved today</i>

139
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,083
<i>to patch up her relations
with the former royal nanny.</i>

140
00:10:15,124 --> 00:10:17,958
<i>Princess Diana flew to Milan today
for the memorial service</i>

141
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:21,333
<i>for the murdered Italian
fashion designer Gianni Versace.</i>

142
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:24,458
<i>Where, tonight,
another royal controversy sparkles.</i>

143
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:28,083
<i>After finding herself embroiled
in her second controversy this week.</i>

144
00:10:28,124 --> 00:10:30,208
<i>I am not a political figure.</i>

145
00:10:31,874 --> 00:10:34,291
<i>Princess Diana sailed out
into the Mediterranean</i>

146
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,499
<i>in one of Mr. Mohamed Al Fayed's
yachts today...</i>

147
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:38,999
<i>with his son.</i>

148
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,458
<i>Quarter of a million pounds
for the photographs,</i>

149
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:44,624
<i>which appear to show
the couple embracing.</i>

150
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:49,041
Once <i>again,
her judgment's under scrutiny.</i>

151
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:22,916
<i>Earlier today,
they visited a local jewelry shop.</i>

152
00:12:46,374 --> 00:12:47,916
Robin Janvrin.

153
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,041
What?

154
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:11,041
- Tell Sir Guy I want everyone in, ASAP.
- Sir.

155
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,583
Ma'am?

156
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,499
Ma'am?

157
00:13:25,999 --> 00:13:27,124
Yes?

158
00:13:27,749 --> 00:13:31,291
- Ma'am, Mr. Janvrin is here to see you.
- What?

159
00:13:36,791 --> 00:13:38,166
What the...

160
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:44,916
Good evening, ma'am.
I'm sorry to disturb,

161
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,249
but I've just had a call
from our embassy in Paris.

162
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,624
It's the Princess of Wales.

163
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,749
Why? What's she done now?

164
00:13:54,374 --> 00:13:58,791
I see. Who are we speaking to there?

165
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:02,374
Right. Well, keep me updated.

166
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:08,124
It's Diana.
She's been in a car accident in Paris.

167
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,791
Is it serious?

168
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:13,833
Apparently Dodi Fayed is dead.

169
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:17,541
<i>Let's just recap on the details
of those injuries, Maxine.</i>

170
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,100
<i>Yes, Nick. What they're saying is that</i>

171
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:23,833
<i>the Princess is in the intensive care
unit of a southeast Paris hospital.</i>

172
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:26,041
<i>She has concussion,</i>
a <i>broken arm</i> and...

173
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:27,916
What was she doing in Paris?

174
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,434
I thought she was supposed
to be in London.

175
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,374
Oh, you know what she's like.

176
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,333
Charles, isn't this awful?

177
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,142
<i>The British Prime Minister, Tony Blair,
has been awakened and is being...</i>

178
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,208
What are you going
to do about the boys?

179
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,124
- Let them sleep until we know more.
- Yes, that's sensible.

180
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,208
I should go to Paris. I told my people
to start organizing a jet.

181
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,916
- What, a private one?
- Yes.

182
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:53,166
But isn't that precisely

183
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,916
the sort of extravagance
they always attack us for?

184
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:58,142
How else am I supposed
to get to Paris at this time of night?

185
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,559
The airport at Aberdeen will be closed.

186
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,124
Charles. Charles, dear.
Use the Royal Flight.

187
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,374
They keep one plane
on permanent standby

188
00:15:06,624 --> 00:15:08,291
in case I should kick the bucket.

189
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,166
No, Mummy. That's out of the question.
This isn't a matter of state.

190
00:15:12,249 --> 00:15:13,333
What are you talking about?

191
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:16,333
Diana is no longer a member
of the Royal Family.

192
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,416
She's not an HRH.
This is a private matter.

193
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,791
She's mother to your grandchildren.

194
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:25,458
- What is happening now?
- I don't know. I can't hear.

195
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:27,499
Everyone's shouting.

196
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:37,208
- Thanks for coming in.
- The ambassador in Paris.

197
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,624
Good evening, sir.

198
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:55,666
Yes?

199
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,874
<i>The Princess's bodyguard
is said to be badly injured.</i>

200
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:03,708
I have just spoken to our ambassador
in Paris, ma'am.

201
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,208
I'm afraid it's not good news.

202
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:07,708
No!

203
00:16:10,124 --> 00:16:11,416
No.

204
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:14,958
No, no, no, no.

205
00:16:22,624 --> 00:16:26,624
<i>Diana, Princess of Wales,
has died after a car crash in Paris.</i>

206
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:28,666
<i>The French Government
announced her death</i>

207
00:16:28,749 --> 00:16:30,624
<i>just before 5:00 this morning.</i>

208
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,374
What have I got on this week?

209
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,958
You're writing your maiden conference
speech as Prime Minister.

210
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:38,666
Well, let's cancel everything else.

211
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,458
This is going to be massive.

212
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:43,833
<i>Her death was confirmed</i>

213
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,291
<i>by the French interior minister...</i>

214
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:46,975
I'd better make a statement
in the morning.

215
00:16:46,999 --> 00:16:50,708
Well, you'll be pleased to know I've
already started coming up with ideas.

216
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,999
God, she's only been dead an hour.

217
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:55,458
Or would you prefer I didn't do my job?

218
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:08,791
At some point later on
today, I shall have to go to Paris.

219
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:13,791
You try and be very, very brave, Wills,
all right?

220
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:17,249
Because it's what
mummy would have wanted.

221
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:27,333
They're going to go back to sleep.

222
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,291
Try, anyway.

223
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,833
My private secretary's office have

224
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,999
found a travel agency
open in New York that will

225
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:51,124
sell me a flight to Paris with an hour's
stopover in Manchester.

226
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:57,041
Perhaps now you might like to consider
whether it's still an extravagance

227
00:17:57,124 --> 00:18:00,624
to bring back the mother
of the future King of England

228
00:18:01,249 --> 00:18:02,833
in one of our planes?

229
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:04,874
All right. Of course.

230
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:22,333
John, I don't want the boys
to see the news and get upset.

231
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,059
First thing in the morning, I want
the radio taken out of the bedroom

232
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,600
and the television
taken out of the nursery.

233
00:18:26,624 --> 00:18:28,083
Yes, ma'am.

234
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,916
- Well, well, well.
- Yes.

235
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:41,874
Are you all right?

236
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,416
Your sister called from Tuscany.

237
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,708
Well, I hope you told her to come back,
cut her holiday short.

238
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:51,791
I did.

239
00:18:51,874 --> 00:18:53,916
I can't imagine she was pleased.

240
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:55,708
That's putting it mildly.

241
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:58,208
- What did she say?
- Something about

242
00:18:58,291 --> 00:19:01,708
Diana managing to be
even more annoying dead than alive.

243
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,791
Just make sure you never let the boys
hear you talk like that.

244
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:05,999
Of course.

245
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,583
Something to help you go down.

246
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:15,416
No, I think I'll write my diary
a little longer.

247
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:20,374
Fine. I'm going to bed.

248
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,624
<i>We've heard nothing
official from the Palace yet.</i>

249
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,017
<i>We still don't know
when we're going to get</i>

250
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,458
<i>any further statements
from inside the Palace</i>

251
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,999
<i>or, of course,
when the Royal Family are due back.</i>

252
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:05,708
And that's how she will remain
in our minds, our hearts

253
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:07,624
forever.

254
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,708
Okay? Got it.

255
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,499
<i>Well, where Will you do it?</i>

256
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,958
We'll do it at the church

257
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:15,666
- on the way in.
- All right. I'll organize it.

258
00:20:15,749 --> 00:20:17,124
<i>Viscount Althorp,</i>

259
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,517
<i>Diana's brother, had this to</i> say...

260
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,374
Hang on. I want to watch this.

261
00:20:23,124 --> 00:20:26,791
<i>This is not a time
for recriminations, but for sadness.</i>

262
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,083
<i>However, I would say
that I always believed</i>

263
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:31,333
<i>the press would kill her in the end.</i>

264
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:32,874
<i>But not even I could imagine</i>

265
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,166
<i>that they would take
such a direct hand in her death</i>

266
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:37,499
as seems to be the case.

267
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:41,541
<i>It would appear that every proprietor
and editor of every publication</i>

268
00:20:41,624 --> 00:20:45,333
<i>that has paid for intrusive
and exploitative photographs of her</i>

269
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,583
<i>has blood on his hands today.</i>

270
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,374
Not the press, mate.
You've got the wrong villain.

271
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,624
Tony.

272
00:20:54,249 --> 00:20:55,249
Got to go.

273
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,624
You about to speak to the Queen?

274
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,958
Yeah.

275
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,916
Ask her if she greased the brakes.

276
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,166
Now, now.

277
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:04,666
Thanks.

278
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,791
Hello?

279
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:15,791
<i>Putting you through,
Prime Minister.</i>

280
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,583
- Oh, right. Okay.
- Please <i>hold.</i>

281
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,166
Is the Prince of Wales with the boys?

282
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,291
- Yes, ma'am.
- Good. And he's going to Paris?

283
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:26,583
Yes.

284
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,999
I'm sorry to disturb, ma'am. Ma'am.

285
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,291
But I've the Prime Minister for you
from his constituency.

286
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,624
Lucky you.

287
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,624
Thank you, Robin.
I'll take it in the study.

288
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,881
- Good morning, Your Majesty.
- Prime Minister.

289
00:21:57,999 --> 00:22:00,833
May I say right away
how very sorry I am

290
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,791
and that the thoughts and prayers
of my family are with you

291
00:22:03,874 --> 00:22:05,458
at this terrible time.

292
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,666
And with the princes, in particular.

293
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:09,208
Thank you.

294
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:14,999
<i>Is it your intention to make some kind
of appearance or statement?</i>

295
00:22:15,708 --> 00:22:18,208
No. No, certainly not.

296
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:22,833
No member of the Royal Family
will speak publicly about this.

297
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,624
This is a private matter.

298
00:22:25,208 --> 00:22:28,208
We would all appreciate it
if it could be respected as such.

299
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:29,749
I see.

300
00:22:32,041 --> 00:22:35,624
I don't suppose anyone's had time
to think about the funeral yet?

301
00:22:35,708 --> 00:22:38,374
Well, we've spoken
with the Spencer family

302
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,416
and it is their wish,
it is their express wish,

303
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:42,291
that this should be a private funeral

304
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:45,291
with a memorial service to follow
in a month or so.

305
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,458
Right.

306
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:49,791
And given that Diana was no longer
a member of the Royal Family

307
00:22:49,874 --> 00:22:52,791
we have no other choice
but to respect their wishes.

308
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,291
I see.

309
00:22:54,541 --> 00:23:00,124
<i>You don't feel that, in view of her
high profile and popularity,</i>

310
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:05,166
it might be an idea to pay tribute
to her life and achievements?

311
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,166
Or even just to her as a mother?

312
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:12,291
Well, as I said, it's her family's wish.

313
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:15,291
And the public, ma'am?
The British people?

314
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:20,291
<i>You don't think a private funeral might
be denying them a chance...</i>

315
00:23:20,374 --> 00:23:21,749
A chance to what?

316
00:23:23,374 --> 00:23:25,333
<i>To share in the grief?</i>

317
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:31,416
This is a family funeral, Mr. Blair,
not a fairground attraction.

318
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:34,666
I think the Princess has already paid
a high enough price for exposure

319
00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:36,958
to the press, don't you?

320
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,166
Now, if there's nothing else,
I must get on.

321
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,166
The children have to be looked after.

322
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:43,916
Of course.
Well, goodbye, Your Majesty.

323
00:23:55,541 --> 00:23:59,083
Her instinct is to do nothing.
Say nothing,

324
00:23:59,874 --> 00:24:03,041
- and give her a private funeral.
- Are you surprised?

325
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,874
She hated her guts.

326
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:07,124
Well, I think it's a mistake.

327
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:10,499
They screwed up her life. Let's hope
they don't screw up her death.

328
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,416
Where can I get a black tie?

329
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:15,833
Oh, the chaplain called.

330
00:24:16,124 --> 00:24:18,833
He wanted to know whether we should
make any changes in the service.

331
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,791
Any special mention of Diana.

332
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,624
What did you say?

333
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:27,124
- Well, I told him not to change a thing.
- Quite right.

334
00:24:27,624 --> 00:24:30,249
I think the less attention
one draws to it, the better.

335
00:24:30,291 --> 00:24:32,041
- For the boys.
- Yes.

336
00:24:32,624 --> 00:24:35,124
But I think maybe we should find some
company for them,

337
00:24:35,166 --> 00:24:36,458
some young people-

338
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,958
I'll take them for a long walk
this afternoon.

339
00:24:38,999 --> 00:24:42,583
- Up Craggy Head.
- Yes, but no guns, Philip. It is Sunday.

340
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:50,874
<i>And we're going... We're going, in fact,
I believe to Sedgefield,</i>

341
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,499
<i>the Prime Minister's constituency,</i>

342
00:24:52,583 --> 00:24:55,291
<i>Where he is about
to make a statement.</i>

343
00:24:55,333 --> 00:25:00,791
<i>Yes, the Prime Minister, coming now
with his wife, Cherie.</i>

344
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:02,499
Yeah, well, apart from that...

345
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:05,291
He's on. Alastair, he's on. Come on.

346
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:11,541
<i>Her own life was often,
sadly, touched by tragedy.</i>

347
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:16,541
<i>She touched the lives
of so many others</i>

348
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:20,291
in Britain, throughout the world,

349
00:25:21,874 --> 00:25:24,874
with joy and with comfort.

350
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,833
<i>The people everywhere,</i>

351
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:31,916
<i>not just here in Britain, everywhere.</i>

352
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:34,916
<i>They kept faith with Princess Diana.</i>

353
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:37,916
<i>They liked her. They loved her.</i>

354
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:43,124
<i>They regarded her
as one of the people.</i>

355
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:47,624
<i>She was the people's princess.</i>

356
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:56,083
<i>And that's how she will stay,
how she will remain,</i>

357
00:25:57,624 --> 00:26:02,458
<i>in our hearts and in our
memories, forever.</i>

358
00:26:03,499 --> 00:26:04,874
Bit over the top, don't you think?

359
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:07,708
<i>The Prime Minister
paying his own tribute</i>

360
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,624
<i>to the Princess of Wales.</i>

361
00:26:10,124 --> 00:26:14,666
<i>"The people of Britain," he said,
"kept faith with Princess Diana.</i>

362
00:26:16,041 --> 00:26:18,874
<i>"They loved her.
She was the people's princess."</i>

363
00:26:28,624 --> 00:26:30,208
Did we remember the Royal Standard?

364
00:26:30,291 --> 00:26:31,291
Yes, sir.

365
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,958
- And flowers?
- Yes, sir.

366
00:26:32,999 --> 00:26:35,291
Good, because if we leave it to
the royal undertakers,

367
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,749
they'll bring her back
in a wooden crate.

368
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:31,791
<i>- Hello?
- This is Lord Airlie.</i>

369
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:33,142
<i>May I speak with
the Prime Minister, please?</i>

370
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:36,458
One moment, please. Lord Airlie.

371
00:27:36,833 --> 00:27:39,083
The Lord Chamberlain
in charge of the funeral.

372
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:41,458
You're meeting him at the airport.

373
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,583
Lord Airlie.

374
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:45,124
Good afternoon, Prime Minister.

375
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:48,374
It's my job to organize
all the ceremonial events.

376
00:27:48,916 --> 00:27:52,708
There is simply no precedent
for the funeral of an ex-HRH.

377
00:27:53,749 --> 00:27:56,124
Perhaps we should plan
for any contingency.

378
00:27:56,166 --> 00:27:58,791
Yes, I propose a meeting
at 10:00 tomorrow morning.

379
00:27:58,833 --> 00:28:00,083
At Buckingham Palace.

380
00:28:00,124 --> 00:28:02,208
<i>Officials from all three palaces,</i>

381
00:28:02,291 --> 00:28:06,374
<i>representatives from the Spencer
family, the emergency services.</i>

382
00:28:06,666 --> 00:28:08,333
And would you send
some of your people?

383
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:10,041
Absolutely. Of course.

384
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,999
"Precedent"?
Where do they find these people'?

385
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,291
Thank you, Airlie.

386
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:33,874
Brigadier Sir Charles Wilton,
Household Division.

387
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:37,791
Air Commodore Wessex,
Queen's Flight.

388
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,208
Prime Minister.

389
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,583
I'm so sorry, sir.

390
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:48,791
And if there's anything I
or my government can do...

391
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:53,249
They stood up as we drove past
in cafes, in restaurants,

392
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:55,041
removed their hats.

393
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,458
This was Paris,

394
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:59,100
one of the busiest cities in the world
and you could hear a pin drop.

395
00:28:59,124 --> 00:29:00,833
I imagine it will be the same here.

396
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,666
The Palace would still prefer
to see this as a private funeral.

397
00:29:03,749 --> 00:29:05,666
What are your feelings on that?

398
00:29:05,749 --> 00:29:07,083
I...

399
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:13,624
I think that'll present
us with difficulties.

400
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,166
So do I.

401
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:20,916
My mother, the Queen, comes from
a generation not best equipped.

402
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:22,791
She grew up in the war.

403
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:25,999
I think what we need,
what this country needs,

404
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:29,624
is a more modern perspective,
if you follow?

405
00:29:30,291 --> 00:29:32,208
Balmoral is...

406
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,708
I think I understand.

407
00:29:39,249 --> 00:29:41,333
<i>An aircraft
of the Queen's Flight</i>

408
00:29:41,416 --> 00:29:43,666
<i>brought the Princess's body
home this evening,</i>

409
00:29:43,749 --> 00:29:45,583
<i>where the Prime Minister, Tony Blair,</i>

410
00:29:45,624 --> 00:29:47,874
<i>had gathered with members
of his government.</i>

411
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,624
<i>A single black hearse
crossed the tarmac</i>

412
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:54,583
<i>and a Royal Air Force Guard
of Honour moved slowly forward.</i>

413
00:29:54,624 --> 00:29:56,333
Has anyone heard
from the Spencers yet?

414
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:58,874
Have they made up their minds
when the funeral will be?

415
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,100
<i>The Prince of Wales had
accompanied the body back from...</i>

416
00:30:01,124 --> 00:30:03,874
Oh, I don't know.
Nobody tells me anything.

417
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:05,958
<i>President Clinton
was with his wife</i>

418
00:30:06,041 --> 00:30:07,499
<i>when he heard the news last night.</i>

419
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:08,999
<i>We liked her very much.</i>

420
00:30:09,083 --> 00:30:13,791
<i>We admired her work for children,
for people with AIDS,</i>

421
00:30:14,041 --> 00:30:16,791
<i>for the cause of ending the scourge
of landmines in the world...</i>

422
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:20,041
On our walk today, one of the ghillies
said he'd seen a large stag

423
00:30:20,124 --> 00:30:21,749
up Craggy Head.

424
00:30:21,791 --> 00:30:23,166
<i>This is a very difficult time...</i>

425
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:25,874
He reckoned 14 points.

426
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:30,624
We haven't had one as big as that
on the estate for years.

427
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,958
No. Quite.

428
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,958
<i>And I was tremendously impressed...</i>

429
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:41,124
Anyway, I thought it might be
a good distraction

430
00:30:41,916 --> 00:30:44,166
- for the boys.
- What? Stalking?

431
00:30:45,416 --> 00:30:47,124
You don't think
that's a bit soon, do you?

432
00:30:47,166 --> 00:30:49,333
I think anything that gets them outside
is a good idea.

433
00:30:49,416 --> 00:30:52,333
<i>In 1981 brought
glamour to the Royal Family.</i>

434
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,708
<i>But as their relationship deteriorated,</i>

435
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:57,458
<i>she became
an increasingly unhappy figure.</i>

436
00:30:57,541 --> 00:31:00,624
<i>The couple divorced
in August of last year.</i>

437
00:31:04,458 --> 00:31:07,874
<i>It was the love story that brought
crowds onto the streets.</i>

438
00:31:07,958 --> 00:31:11,083
<i>They came to see the Queen,
of course, and the Prince,</i>

439
00:31:11,124 --> 00:31:13,999
<i>but most of all
they came to see Diana.</i>

440
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:16,291
I'm going to bed.

441
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,374
<i>But the seemingly perfect fairy tale
was destined not to...</i>

442
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:40,249
I'll ring the Lord Chamberlain's office.

443
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,475
Say we're going
to send representatives

444
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:44,083
to the meeting tomorrow morning
at 10:00.

445
00:31:44,291 --> 00:31:46,083
Thank you, Stephen.

446
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,249
<i>She gave us so much.</i>

447
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:04,958
<i>Why couldn't we have given her a little
something and left her alone?</i>

448
00:32:05,458 --> 00:32:08,499
<i>It just hurts me so much.</i>

449
00:32:08,791 --> 00:32:10,871
<i>I've never experienced
anything like this. I can't...</i>

450
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:14,791
<i>I think I'm... I keep waiting to wake up
like it's a bad dream.</i>

451
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,374
Right, it's 10:00.
Let's get started, shall we?

452
00:32:31,458 --> 00:32:34,666
And thank you all for coming
at such short notice.

453
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:39,124
I think we all agree that this is an
extraordinarily sensitive occasion

454
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:43,124
which presents us with tremendous
challenges: logistically,

455
00:32:43,958 --> 00:32:47,291
constitutionally, practically,

456
00:32:47,583 --> 00:32:51,166
diplomatically, and procedurally.

457
00:32:51,708 --> 00:32:53,374
Oh, Christ!

458
00:32:59,708 --> 00:33:03,416
After 18 years of opposition,
I am proud to stand before you

459
00:33:03,458 --> 00:33:05,249
as the new Prime Minister
of our country...

460
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:07,374
Labour Prime Minister.

461
00:33:08,124 --> 00:33:11,624
I want to set an ambitious course
to modernize this country,

462
00:33:11,708 --> 00:33:14,624
to breathe new life into old institutions.

463
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:17,833
To make privilege
something for the many, not the few.

464
00:33:17,916 --> 00:33:19,124
Flipping heck!

465
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:22,583
You think the Royals are nutters?
You should meet their flunkies.

466
00:33:22,624 --> 00:33:24,767
Two and a half hours on whether
she should be carried in a hearse

467
00:33:24,791 --> 00:33:26,041
or a gun carriage.

468
00:33:26,124 --> 00:33:28,458
Anyway, you got raves in the press.

469
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:30,666
This lot call you,
"The nation's mourner in chief."

470
00:33:31,624 --> 00:33:33,059
This lot says you're the only person

471
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,999
who's correctly judged the mood
of the country.

472
00:33:35,083 --> 00:33:36,208
Hello?

473
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:38,416
Even the <i>Mail</i> was impressed.

474
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:42,166
"People's princess," mate.
You owe me.

475
00:33:45,583 --> 00:33:48,208
- Gordon, for you.
- Te|| him to hang on.

476
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,749
Alastair.

477
00:33:50,958 --> 00:33:53,598
So have they come to their senses?
Is it gonna be a public funeral?

478
00:33:53,624 --> 00:33:55,916
Yeah. Saturday. It's a Whopper.

479
00:33:55,958 --> 00:33:58,333
- The Abbey, the works.
- Great.

480
00:33:58,416 --> 00:34:00,499
Has anyone told the Queen yet?

481
00:34:00,583 --> 00:34:03,624
I don't know. No doubt some flunky
will be dispatched

482
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:05,374
groveling on all fours.

483
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:10,916
Are you game?

484
00:34:15,124 --> 00:34:18,041
Do you think it's wise for the boys
to go stalking so soon?

485
00:34:18,124 --> 00:34:21,166
Anything that gets
them into the fresh air is a good thing.

486
00:34:21,249 --> 00:34:22,874
Maybe they shouldn't take their guns.

487
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,874
I mean, if a photographer
were to see them,

488
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:27,124
it might send out the wrong signal.

489
00:34:27,499 --> 00:34:30,041
If there is a photographer out there

490
00:34:30,124 --> 00:34:32,749
he could be the first kill of the day.

491
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:39,458
I see Mr. Fayed was buried last night.

492
00:34:40,041 --> 00:34:43,666
At midnight. No cameras, no fuss.

493
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,624
Very dignified.

494
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,333
Why do they do that?

495
00:34:48,416 --> 00:34:51,374
Why do they bury their bodies
so soon after the death?

496
00:34:51,458 --> 00:34:53,124
Islamic tradition.

497
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:56,249
Something to do with the heat.

498
00:34:57,624 --> 00:34:59,333
Stops the body decomposing.

499
00:35:00,541 --> 00:35:01,958
Yes, come in.

500
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,333
Good morning, ma'am. Ma'am.

501
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,916
Yes, Robin. What can we do for you?

502
00:35:10,083 --> 00:35:13,916
Ma'am, there was a meeting
at the Palace this morning.

503
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:16,291
About the funeral
arrangements, yes.

504
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:20,624
The Lord Chamberlain faxed over
these plans for you to consider.

505
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,999
There is now
general agreement, ma'am,

506
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:30,249
that a public funeral
would be more appropriate.

507
00:35:35,374 --> 00:35:36,624
I see.

508
00:35:38,249 --> 00:35:41,291
And what form will this funeral take?

509
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:43,916
At the moment, they're suggesting,

510
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:49,624
and, of course, these are early days,
basing it on Tay Bridge.

511
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,208
- Tay Bridge?
- What?

512
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,874
Tay Bridge is the codename
for my funeral.

513
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:58,624
Indeed, ma'am.

514
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:01,666
But it would be for
practical reasons only.

515
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:06,291
It's the only one
which has been rehearsed.

516
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,041
The only one that could be
put together in time.

517
00:36:10,999 --> 00:36:14,124
But I supervised those plans myself.

518
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:18,124
Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain
was at pains to stress

519
00:36:18,208 --> 00:36:21,208
that the spirit of the occasion
will be quite different.

520
00:36:21,291 --> 00:36:25,791
For example, the suggestion is
that instead of 400 soldiers,

521
00:36:25,874 --> 00:36:29,583
400 representatives
of the Princess's various charities

522
00:36:29,624 --> 00:36:32,499
march behind the coffin.

523
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:38,124
And instead of foreign heads of state
and crown heads of Europe,

524
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:43,583
the guests would include a sprinkling
of actors of stage and screen,

525
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:48,958
fashion designers,
and other celebrities.

526
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:50,749
Celebrities?

527
00:36:58,374 --> 00:37:00,874
Was there, was there anything else?

528
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:02,708
No, ma'am.

529
00:37:06,041 --> 00:37:08,249
Oh, yes, one other thing.

530
00:37:08,499 --> 00:37:11,749
The Police Commissioner
was keen that you consider

531
00:37:11,791 --> 00:37:15,041
the idea of a condolence book.

532
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:18,416
It would give the growing crowds
something to do,

533
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:20,124
make marshaling them easier.

534
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:22,041
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

535
00:37:23,708 --> 00:37:25,958
Oh, and the flowers.

536
00:37:26,874 --> 00:37:28,124
What flowers?

537
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,833
The flowers outside
Buckingham Palace.

538
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:34,333
At the moment they're blocking
the path through the main gate

539
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:36,767
and it will make things difficult
for the Changing of the Guard.

540
00:37:36,791 --> 00:37:39,291
Oh, fine. Then just move them away.

541
00:37:40,374 --> 00:37:42,791
Actually, the Lord Chamberlain
was wondering

542
00:37:42,833 --> 00:37:44,708
whether we shouldn't leave the flowers

543
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:47,791
and send the Guards
through the North Gate.

544
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:52,333
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
Yes, quite right.

545
00:38:01,458 --> 00:38:03,583
Stephen Lamport on one.

546
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:04,666
Who?

547
00:38:04,749 --> 00:38:07,249
The Prince of Wales's
private secretary. Balmoral.

548
00:38:07,291 --> 00:38:09,083
He says it's urgent.

549
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,124
It's all right.

550
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,499
Good morning.

551
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:16,743
<i>Good morning, Prime Minister.</i>

552
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:19,958
The Prince of Wales has asked me.

553
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:22,124
To thank you again
for your kind words yesterday.

554
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,499
Not at all.

555
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:25,624
<i>The Prince feels that</i>

556
00:38:26,249 --> 00:38:29,874
you and he are both modern men

557
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:32,583
of similar mind.

558
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:36,416
Who could work well together
at this difficult time.

559
00:38:36,583 --> 00:38:40,374
Well, please thank His Highness,

560
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:45,791
and assure him he can count
on my full support at all times.

561
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,541
Was that it?

562
00:38:50,124 --> 00:38:51,333
Yes.

563
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:53,208
Goodbye.

564
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,624
Bizarre.

565
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:05,708
- Why is Charles doing this?
- What?

566
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:07,291
Creeping up to me like this?

567
00:39:07,374 --> 00:39:09,624
Banging on about being modern.

568
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:12,791
He did it at the airport when he asked
me to deal with his mother.

569
00:39:12,874 --> 00:39:16,416
Because he knows that if the Queen
continues to get it wrong over Diana,

570
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:19,374
then the Royals will become
public enemy number one.

571
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:21,791
And he's terrified
of being shot, apparently.

572
00:39:21,874 --> 00:39:22,874
Who, Charles?

573
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:25,583
His people have already been on to us
to ask for extra protection.

574
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:28,458
Well, he probably thinks
that if he's seen to be on our side,

575
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:31,124
then that'll leave the Queen
in the firing line.

576
00:39:31,166 --> 00:39:35,166
What? So it's okay for his mother
to take the bullet and not him?

577
00:39:35,791 --> 00:39:37,208
What a family.

578
00:39:39,958 --> 00:39:43,083
- Wait. Where are they?
- They're up at Craggy Head.

579
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:47,458
Come on. Yes.

580
00:39:47,499 --> 00:39:48,583
I'll come with you.

581
00:39:48,624 --> 00:39:50,392
- Go on. In you go.
- Do you want me to drive?

582
00:39:50,416 --> 00:39:52,124
No. Certainly not.

583
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,350
I thought you were going to get
a new one of these.

584
00:40:00,374 --> 00:40:02,541
What for? It's perfectly all right.

585
00:40:08,249 --> 00:40:10,791
I was thinking last night what Diana
might have done

586
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:13,958
had it been me that died
in the tunnel in Paris.

587
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:16,708
She would certainly have taken
the boys to Paris.

588
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,624
I rather regret not doing that now.

589
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:21,124
And expose them to the media?

590
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:23,624
No, that would have been a dreadful
thing to do.

591
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:27,041
No, they're much better off here.
It's private, they're protected.

592
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,874
Whatever else you may have thought
of Diana, she was a wonderful mother.

593
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:33,833
She adored those boys,
and never let them forget it.

594
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:37,124
Always warm and physical.

595
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,916
Never afraid to show her feelings.

596
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:41,624
Especially whenever a photographer
was in sight.

597
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:44,458
Yes, she may have encouraged all that,
but, still,

598
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:47,958
that was always
the extraordinary thing about her.

599
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:52,874
Her weaknesses and transgressions
only made the public love her more.

600
00:40:53,499 --> 00:40:55,458
Yet ours only make them hate us.
Why is that?

601
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:56,791
Why do they hate us so much?

602
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,749
- Not us, dear.
- What?

603
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:06,458
Yesterday, when we brought the coffin
back, there was a noise, a bang.

604
00:41:06,583 --> 00:41:08,541
I don't mind telling you,
I thought it was a gun.

605
00:41:08,624 --> 00:41:11,333
I thought someone
had taken a shot at me.

606
00:41:13,416 --> 00:41:15,291
Think I'm going to walk back.

607
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:17,874
I don't feel like stalking.

608
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,583
- Are you sure?
- I'll take the dogs.

609
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:22,791
<i>Walkies? Yes!</i>

610
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:44,041
Who knows the way home? Come on.

611
00:42:31,874 --> 00:42:34,833
<i>Do you think
you will ever be Queen?</i>

612
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:39,416
<i>No, I don't. No.</i>

613
00:42:39,708 --> 00:42:41,583
<i>Why do you think that?</i>

614
00:42:43,291 --> 00:42:47,624
<i>I'd like to be a queen of people's
hearts, in people's hearts.</i>

615
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:51,624
<i>But I don't see myself
being Queen of this country.</i>

616
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,708
<i>I don't think many people would want
me to be Queen, actually.</i>

617
00:42:54,791 --> 00:42:58,916
<i>When I say many people, I mean the
Establishment that I'm married into,</i>

618
00:42:59,541 --> 00:43:03,958
<i>because they've decided
that I'm a non-starter.</i>

619
00:43:05,208 --> 00:43:06,208
<i>But by the time...</i>

620
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,458
Charles and I had a talk
in the car today.

621
00:43:11,166 --> 00:43:14,791
He was good enough to share with me
his thoughts on motherhood.

622
00:43:15,124 --> 00:43:16,458
What did he say?

623
00:43:17,208 --> 00:43:19,374
How wonderful Diana was.

624
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:20,958
That's changing his tune.

625
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:22,666
What a natural.

626
00:43:23,124 --> 00:43:25,999
<i>That's precluded you, effectively,
from becoming Queen.</i>

627
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:28,791
<i>They see me as a threat of some kind.</i>

628
00:43:29,124 --> 00:43:31,416
Oh, for God's sake!

629
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:35,874
Maybe he's got a point.
Maybe we are partly to blame.

630
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:39,499
Oh, I can't watch this.

631
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:42,124
No, no. Wait, please. No, leave it.

632
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:44,416
<i>Because I don't go by a rule book.</i>

633
00:43:44,458 --> 00:43:47,791
<i>Because I lead from the heart,
not the head.</i>

634
00:43:47,874 --> 00:43:50,749
<i>And albeit that's got me into trouble
in my work, I understand that...</i>

635
00:43:50,791 --> 00:43:53,083
We encouraged the match.

636
00:43:53,958 --> 00:43:55,999
We signed off on it, both of us.

637
00:43:56,083 --> 00:43:58,541
You were very enthusiastic, remember?

638
00:43:58,624 --> 00:44:00,166
She was a nice girl,

639
00:44:00,499 --> 00:44:01,499
then.

640
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:06,083
And I was sure
he'd give the other one up.

641
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:09,124
Or at least make sure his wife
toed the line.

642
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:11,833
Isn't that what everyone does?

643
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,041
Is it?

644
00:44:13,124 --> 00:44:14,767
<i>Do you think
Mrs. Parker Bowles was a factor</i>

645
00:44:14,791 --> 00:44:17,291
<i>in the breakdown of your marriage?</i>

646
00:44:17,374 --> 00:44:21,791
<i>Well, there were three of us in this
marriage. So it was a bit crowded.</i>

647
00:44:23,333 --> 00:44:24,499
<i>Four months later...</i>

648
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:28,624
I can't bear it anymore.
If you're watching, I'll sleep next door.

649
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,208
Early start tomorrow.

650
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:32,666
- Any luck with your stag?
- No.

651
00:44:33,291 --> 00:44:36,124
But close.
A couple of hundred yards at one point.

652
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:38,708
One of the boys even got a shot off.

653
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,458
We'll get him tomorrow.

654
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,791
See you in the morning.

655
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:48,958
Not to worry.

656
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:50,249
Night-night.

657
00:44:50,458 --> 00:44:53,666
<i>And her struggle with
the eating disorder, bulimia.</i>

658
00:44:53,749 --> 00:44:55,791
<i>And her obsession with the belief.</i>

659
00:44:55,874 --> 00:44:59,958
<i>That Charles continued to love
a woman he'd fallen for years before,</i>

660
00:44:59,999 --> 00:45:01,041
<i>Camilla...</i>

661
00:45:17,249 --> 00:45:19,624
The good news is that
the Palace has agreed

662
00:45:19,666 --> 00:45:21,958
- to video screens in the Royal Parks.
- And the bad news?

663
00:45:21,999 --> 00:45:23,583
- Crash barriers.
- What about them?

664
00:45:23,624 --> 00:45:24,684
Well, they're now predicting

665
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,916
more than two million people
will descend on London

666
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:29,083
and there aren't enough barriers
to line the route.

667
00:45:29,124 --> 00:45:32,458
So, we've gone cap in hand
to the French for theirs.

668
00:45:32,749 --> 00:45:35,291
And there's something else
I think you should see.

669
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:38,374
- Can we run that piece again?
- Of course.

670
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:40,333
You're gonna love this.

671
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:42,458
<i>I find their behavior very disgraceful.</i>

672
00:45:42,499 --> 00:45:43,916
<i>What do you think, madam?</i>

673
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:47,791
<i>I think it's disgusting that they've
not appeared or said a word</i>

674
00:45:47,999 --> 00:45:49,499
<i>relating to all this.</i>

675
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:52,124
- Look, I know all this.
- Wait for it.

676
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,291
<i>Not to have a flag up.</i>

677
00:45:53,374 --> 00:45:56,124
<i>I think it's a disgrace
on the whole Royal Family.</i>

678
00:45:56,166 --> 00:46:00,624
<i>Okay, the Queen's not in residence
today, but where the hell is the flag?</i>

679
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,624
<i>You see what I'm saying
about the Establishment?</i>

680
00:46:03,708 --> 00:46:07,833
Don't tell me there isn't a flag flying
at half mast over Buckingham Palace?

681
00:46:07,916 --> 00:46:11,208
<i>She was their King and Queen.
Dodi, them two were together.</i>

682
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,208
<i>- It was a fairy tale come true.
- God!</i>

683
00:46:13,541 --> 00:46:17,083
Will someone please save these
people from themselves?

684
00:46:17,624 --> 00:46:19,749
- Fine, I'll call Balmoral.
- Planet Zog.

685
00:46:19,791 --> 00:46:22,267
Because as Prime Minister,
I've really got nothing better to do.

686
00:46:22,291 --> 00:46:24,666
Come on, dogs. Come on.

687
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,874
Those firelighters all right? Bit damp?

688
00:46:39,458 --> 00:46:42,458
Oh, well, I brought some stew
just in case.

689
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:44,309
I think it's lamb.
We could always have that cold.

690
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:46,291
No, we'll be all right.

691
00:46:47,916 --> 00:46:49,166
Stay.

692
00:46:51,416 --> 00:46:54,333
Robin had a call
from the Prime Minister

693
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:56,458
who expressed his concern.

694
00:46:56,958 --> 00:46:58,624
About what?

695
00:46:58,666 --> 00:47:01,291
About the flag
above Buckingham Palace.

696
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:04,416
He thinks it should be flying
at half mast.

697
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:08,833
And I hope Robin told him there isn't
a flag above Buckingham Palace.

698
00:47:08,916 --> 00:47:11,583
There's the Royal Standard,
which flies for one reason only,

699
00:47:11,624 --> 00:47:13,916
to denote the presence of the monarch.

700
00:47:13,958 --> 00:47:18,166
Since you're here the flagpole is bare,
which is as it should be.

701
00:47:18,249 --> 00:47:24,416
Isn't it possible that, for some people,
the Royal Standard is just a flag?

702
00:47:25,708 --> 00:47:29,583
And that the flagpole being bare
sends out the wrong signal?

703
00:47:29,624 --> 00:47:30,958
No, that's not the point.

704
00:47:31,041 --> 00:47:34,624
The point is,
it's more than 400 years old.

705
00:47:34,708 --> 00:47:36,541
It's never been lowered for anyone.

706
00:47:36,624 --> 00:47:40,499
Your grandfather didn't get the flag
at half mast when he died.

707
00:47:41,499 --> 00:47:45,083
And if your mother died tomorrow,
she wouldn't either.

708
00:47:45,124 --> 00:47:47,833
Yes, Granny, but sometimes,
in a situation like this,

709
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:49,791
one has to be flexible.

710
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:51,916
It is just a flag.

711
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:55,749
"What about the Union Jack?"
was Mr. Blair's next suggestion.

712
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,166
- For Heaven's sake.
- The next thing he'll be suggesting

713
00:47:58,249 --> 00:48:01,166
you change your name to Hilda
and mine to Hector!

714
00:48:01,249 --> 00:48:03,374
Who does he think he's talking to?

715
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:05,791
You're the Sovereign,
the Head of State.

716
00:48:05,874 --> 00:48:08,124
You don't get dictated to.

717
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:10,708
You've conceded the idea
of a public funeral.

718
00:48:10,791 --> 00:48:13,583
You've opened up the Parks.
That's enough!

719
00:48:14,499 --> 00:48:16,124
The boys.

720
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:19,916
You wait. In 48 hours,
this will all have calmed down.

721
00:48:52,791 --> 00:48:55,416
Well, in one sense it's comforting.

722
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,975
For the first time, my parents can see

723
00:48:56,999 --> 00:48:58,679
what it's been like for me
all these years,

724
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:01,249
being up against her popularity.

725
00:49:01,291 --> 00:49:04,083
But they're still making the mistake
of thinking the Diana they knew

726
00:49:04,124 --> 00:49:06,541
from living and dealing with her

727
00:49:06,624 --> 00:49:10,499
will eventually be the one seen
by the public, but it won't.

728
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:16,041
The two Diana's, the public's and ours,
bear no relation to one another at all.

729
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,166
I've been thinking,

730
00:49:20,249 --> 00:49:22,749
the flag of Saint George's is
at half mast over Highgrove?

731
00:49:22,791 --> 00:49:23,833
Yes, sir.

732
00:49:23,916 --> 00:49:25,975
Well, make sure we get a picture
of that in the papers, will you?

733
00:49:25,999 --> 00:49:28,708
I'll get on to the tabloids.
Call in a few favors.

734
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:32,333
What about a statement of gratitude
to the crowds?

735
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,958
Something heartfelt
from myself and the boys,

736
00:49:37,041 --> 00:49:40,041
thanking people for all the flowers
and so on.

737
00:49:40,124 --> 00:49:41,124
Right.

738
00:49:41,208 --> 00:49:44,083
<i>Di was wonderful because she
stood up to the Establishment.</i>

739
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:45,833
<i>We have no one doing that now.</i>

740
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:48,374
<i>She said, you're detached,
elitist people,</i>

741
00:49:48,458 --> 00:49:51,208
<i>we are paying millions of pounds
to be better than us,</i>

742
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:53,541
<i>and you've gotta get out there
amongst the people.</i>

743
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:57,124
<i>We have a wonderful new
Prime Minister in England, Tony Blair.</i>

744
00:49:57,166 --> 00:49:58,791
<i>A compassionate young man</i>

745
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:02,624
<i>who, after 18 years
of Establishment Tory rule,</i>

746
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,833
it's such a breath of fresh air.

747
00:50:04,916 --> 00:50:07,791
<i>And I feel he will do something
about this in England, I really do.</i>

748
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:09,749
I bet you this'|| be
the first stirrings of...

749
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,791
What?

750
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:13,583
I don't know.
Something more interesting.

751
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,434
You know, maybe this time
people will finally have seen them

752
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,708
for what they actually are.

753
00:50:18,791 --> 00:50:19,999
Which is?

754
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:24,624
A bunch of freeloading,
emotionally retarded nutters.

755
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:29,041
- That's just absurd.
- Why?

756
00:50:29,124 --> 00:50:31,666
They live in a ludicrous cocoon
of privilege and wealth.

757
00:50:31,749 --> 00:50:33,583
- And they don't pay tax.
- Yes, they do.

758
00:50:33,624 --> 00:50:35,642
Not on all their income.
The Queen alone costs us what,

759
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,999
thirty, forty million a year?

760
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,100
Look, if you want to have
a serious conversation about this...

761
00:50:39,124 --> 00:50:40,791
- I do.
- About the constitution.

762
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,083
- We don't have one.
- About ways in which we,

763
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,249
as a government,

764
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,249
could phase out hereditary privileges,
then fine.

765
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,975
If you're gonna leave,
will you take the plate?

766
00:50:48,999 --> 00:50:52,124
But, you know, spare me the whole
"off with their heads" thing.

767
00:50:52,166 --> 00:50:55,083
- Why?
- Because it insults your intelligence.

768
00:50:55,416 --> 00:50:57,583
<i>The Queen cannot be expected
to change.</i>

769
00:50:57,624 --> 00:51:01,249
It's unimaginable,
this country being a republic.

770
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:03,958
- Certainly in her lifetime.
- Why?

771
00:51:03,999 --> 00:51:07,791
Because no one would wear it.
No one wants it.

772
00:51:08,708 --> 00:51:09,958
It's just

773
00:51:11,208 --> 00:51:12,291
daft.

774
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:16,791
- It's not a mother thing, is it?
- What?

775
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:20,166
Well, if she were alive now,

776
00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:23,124
your mother would be
exactly the same age.

777
00:51:23,458 --> 00:51:25,791
I mean, you were always saying
how stoical she was.

778
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:29,083
Old fashioned, uncomplaining,
lived through the war.

779
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:30,916
Oh, come on.
Who does that sound like'?

780
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,208
I'm gonna do the washing up.

781
00:51:50,499 --> 00:51:52,791
That's the stalking party off.

782
00:51:53,249 --> 00:51:57,291
Right. We'd better have a look
at those papers.

783
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:01,958
"Show us there's a heart in the
House of Windsor," says The <i>Sun.</i>

784
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:05,166
"It's proof the Royals are not like us,"
the Mirror.

785
00:52:06,166 --> 00:52:09,999
"Time to change the old guard
at Buckingham Palace," Express.

786
00:52:11,791 --> 00:52:15,041
"One can't help wondering
whose advice they are taking"

787
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:17,708
"for it's clearly the wrong advice."

788
00:52:19,416 --> 00:52:21,999
I'll try not to take that personally.

789
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:25,833
"People have been yearning
for a change in this country." Good.

790
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:28,708
"The result is a quiet revolution
now taking place,"

791
00:52:28,791 --> 00:52:31,999
"led by the real modernizers,
the British people."

792
00:52:32,083 --> 00:52:34,208
Revolution? Who wrote this?

793
00:52:36,249 --> 00:52:38,416
Where does this come from?

794
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:39,874
Where does it come from?

795
00:52:39,958 --> 00:52:41,916
You just won a huge landslide majority.

796
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,249
And people want to see a change.

797
00:52:45,124 --> 00:52:47,499
Why? What did you think it meant?

798
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,541
Hurry up, dear. Your tea's getting cold.

799
00:52:53,624 --> 00:52:54,999
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

800
00:52:55,083 --> 00:52:59,416
Just the letter of condolence to
the widow of the ambassador to Brazil.

801
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,291
Good. Thank you.

802
00:53:06,291 --> 00:53:09,374
Tea! Oh, good.

803
00:53:09,874 --> 00:53:13,958
Mr. Janvrin, the Prime Minister wishes
to speak to Her Majesty.

804
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:20,124
Ma'am.

805
00:53:20,624 --> 00:53:23,999
Apparently, the Prime Minister
is on the phone for you.

806
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,958
Tell him to call back.

807
00:53:28,124 --> 00:53:30,708
No, no, it's all right. I'll take it.

808
00:53:39,458 --> 00:53:40,791
Prime Minister?

809
00:53:40,833 --> 00:53:43,791
Good morning, Your Majesty.
Sorry to disturb.

810
00:53:44,124 --> 00:53:48,124
But I was just wondering whether
you'd seen any of today's papers?

811
00:53:48,624 --> 00:53:51,249
We've managed to look
at one or two, yes.

812
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,833
<i>In which case,
my next question would be</i>

813
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:56,624
<i>whether you felt</i>

814
00:53:56,958 --> 00:54:00,249
<i>some kind of response
might be necessary?</i>

815
00:54:02,499 --> 00:54:03,583
No.

816
00:54:04,333 --> 00:54:08,416
I believe a few over-eager editors
are doing their best to sell newspapers,

817
00:54:08,458 --> 00:54:11,249
and it would be a mistake
to dance to their tune.

818
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:14,166
<i>Under normal circumstances,
I would agree.</i>

819
00:54:16,958 --> 00:54:20,041
<i>But, well, my advisers have been</i>

820
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:23,874
taking the temperature
among people on the streets,

821
00:54:24,499 --> 00:54:29,041
and, well, the information I'm getting
is that the mood

822
00:54:30,458 --> 00:54:32,124
<i>is quite delicate.</i>

823
00:54:35,124 --> 00:54:37,458
So, what would you suggest,
Prime Minister?

824
00:54:37,499 --> 00:54:39,499
Some kind of statement?

825
00:54:39,583 --> 00:54:40,958
No, ma'am.

826
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:45,124
I believe the moment for statements
has passed.

827
00:54:48,374 --> 00:54:52,583
<i>I would suggest flying the flag at
half mast above Buckingham Palace.</i>

828
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,458
<i>And</i>

829
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,791
coming down to London
at the earliest opportunity.

830
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:03,749
<i>It would be a great comfort
to your people</i>

831
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:08,291
and would help them with their grief.

832
00:55:09,208 --> 00:55:11,083
Their grief?

833
00:55:12,624 --> 00:55:14,499
If you imagine
I'm going to drop everything

834
00:55:14,583 --> 00:55:17,124
and come down to London
before I attend to my grandchildren

835
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:19,458
who've just lost their mother,

836
00:55:20,624 --> 00:55:22,458
then you're mistaken.

837
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,499
I doubt there is anyone

838
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:27,499
who knows the British people
more than I do, Mr. Blair,

839
00:55:27,583 --> 00:55:31,124
nor who has greater faith
in their wisdom and judgment.

840
00:55:31,624 --> 00:55:35,791
And it is my belief that they will,
any moment, reject this...

841
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:40,416
This mood which is being stirred up
by the press,

842
00:55:41,499 --> 00:55:46,958
in favor of a period of restrained grief
and sober private mourning.

843
00:55:48,999 --> 00:55:51,749
That's the way we do things
in this country.

844
00:55:51,791 --> 00:55:54,583
Quietly. With dignity.

845
00:55:57,208 --> 00:56:00,124
That's what the rest of the world
has always admired us for.

846
00:56:00,208 --> 00:56:04,624
If that's your decision, ma'am, of
course the government will support it.

847
00:56:05,749 --> 00:56:07,166
Let's keep in touch.

848
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:09,124
Yes. Let's.

849
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:20,041
Bloody fool.
And now your tea's gone cold.

850
00:56:25,333 --> 00:56:28,083
Tony. Robin Janvrin on one.

851
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,666
He was listening in.

852
00:56:35,374 --> 00:56:36,791
Robin.

853
00:56:36,874 --> 00:56:40,291
I understand how difficult
her behavior must seem to you.

854
00:56:40,374 --> 00:56:41,999
How unhelpful.

855
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:44,791
But try and see it from her perspective.

856
00:56:44,833 --> 00:56:48,458
She's been brought up to believe
it's God's will,

857
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:50,374
<i>she is who she is.</i>

858
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:55,624
I think we should leave God out of it.
It's just not helpful.

859
00:56:55,666 --> 00:56:59,124
She just won't have seen
anything like this since the abdication.

860
00:56:59,166 --> 00:57:02,499
And I cannot emphasize enough
what effect that had on her.

861
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:06,333
Unexpectedly becoming King
as good as killed her father.

862
00:57:06,749 --> 00:57:09,333
<i>I'm afraid she's in a state of shock.</i>

863
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:12,541
<i>This public reaction
has completely thrown her.</i>

864
00:57:13,166 --> 00:57:14,458
All right.

865
00:57:15,958 --> 00:57:19,458
But first we have to deal
with these terrible headlines.

866
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:21,374
I'll see what I can do with the press.

867
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:23,749
I'm most grateful, Prime Minister.

868
00:57:25,291 --> 00:57:29,624
But I can't promise anything.
It's not me they want to see.

869
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,249
Ask Alastair to come and see me,
would you?

870
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,416
Okay.

871
00:58:01,249 --> 00:58:03,791
And cancel what I'm doing tonight.

872
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:10,458
- Good morning.
- Your Majesty.

873
00:58:10,499 --> 00:58:11,559
- Morning, ma'am.
- Morning, ma'am.

874
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:15,583
- Thomas, where have they gone today?
- Up to Aberganny Reach, ma'am.

875
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:19,624
All that way.
Remind me, that's right at the fork?

876
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:20,791
That's right, ma'am.

877
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:23,583
You follow the track for about a mile,
past Glen Horach,

878
00:58:23,624 --> 00:58:26,124
- and then you come to...
- The river.

879
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:28,934
One of the lads will drive you.

880
00:58:28,958 --> 00:58:31,017
No, no, that's all right,
I'll manage, thank you. Thank you.

881
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:32,291
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

882
00:59:36,166 --> 00:59:37,666
Bugger it!

883
01:00:02,541 --> 01:00:03,791
Stupid!

884
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:29,083
<i>- Hello, Thomas?
- Hello, ma'am.</i>

885
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:30,684
I'm afraid I've done something
rather foolish.

886
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,249
I've broken the prop shaft
crossing the river.

887
01:00:33,291 --> 01:00:34,499
Are you sure, ma'am?

888
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:35,999
Yes, of course I'm sure.

889
01:00:36,083 --> 01:00:39,458
It's the front one, not the rear.
Lost the four-wheel drive.

890
01:00:39,541 --> 01:00:42,291
Don't forget, I used to be a mechanic
during the war.

891
01:00:42,333 --> 01:00:43,624
And are you all right?

892
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,166
No, no, I'm perfectly all right.

893
01:00:45,249 --> 01:00:46,934
- We'll come out straight away.
- Oh, <i>would</i> you?

894
01:00:46,958 --> 01:00:48,934
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Yes, I'll wait by the car.

895
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,624
You are kind. Bye.

896
01:02:07,958 --> 01:02:10,374
Oh, you're a beauty.

897
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:30,958
Go on.

898
01:02:31,874 --> 01:02:33,166
Go on!

899
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,458
Go on!

900
01:03:12,208 --> 01:03:14,333
I've just been told
there's news crews outside.

901
01:03:14,416 --> 01:03:16,874
Waiting for you to come
and speak to the people.

902
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,458
- Yes.
- What's all that about?

903
01:03:19,749 --> 01:03:22,249
I told the Queen's private secretary
I'd do what I could

904
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:23,999
to help with the press.

905
01:03:24,083 --> 01:03:25,541
Why?

906
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:30,499
Don't you think she deserves it?
Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres.

907
01:03:30,583 --> 01:03:32,916
Yes, but allowing her to hang herself

908
01:03:32,958 --> 01:03:35,708
might not be
in our best interests either.

909
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:40,791
Besides, I think there's something ugly

910
01:03:40,874 --> 01:03:43,874
about the way everyone's started
to bully her.

911
01:04:04,624 --> 01:04:06,999
<i>The first thing
that you obviously think about</i>

912
01:04:07,083 --> 01:04:09,958
<i>is the rest of your family. And I think...</i>

913
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:11,434
<i>When is she coming
to London, Mr. Blair?</i>

914
01:04:11,458 --> 01:04:13,458
<i>- Well...
- She is our figure head.</i>

915
01:04:13,499 --> 01:04:14,767
<i>- She is our head of this nation.
- She is,</i>

916
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,059
<i>and her thoughts are with us all.</i>

917
01:04:16,083 --> 01:04:20,624
<i>She wanted me to pass on to
the people here, crowding around us...</i>

918
01:04:20,666 --> 01:04:22,225
<i>With a moment to spare,
the Prime Minister</i>

919
01:04:22,249 --> 01:04:24,684
<i>went down Downing Street to have
a word with some of the ordinary...</i>

920
01:04:24,708 --> 01:04:27,416
- How are the boys?
- Not so good tonight.

921
01:04:28,166 --> 01:04:32,041
A lot of slamming doors.
I think they saw the papers.

922
01:04:32,124 --> 01:04:33,541
Oh, no.

923
01:04:33,624 --> 01:04:36,583
I'll take them out early again
tomorrow morning.

924
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,749
Let them take it out on the stag.

925
01:04:42,666 --> 01:04:43,767
<i>What do you think of the way</i>

926
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:45,333
<i>the Royal Family has behaved?</i>

927
01:04:45,416 --> 01:04:48,041
<i>- They've made a serious mistake.
- Pardon?</i>

928
01:04:48,124 --> 01:04:50,291
<i>They've made a serious mistake.</i>

929
01:04:50,333 --> 01:04:52,124
<i>Why, what do you mean?</i>

930
01:04:52,166 --> 01:04:54,541
<i>Well, they should've came...
They should've...</i>

931
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:56,833
<i>The family should have come down</i>

932
01:04:56,916 --> 01:05:00,999
<i>to Buckingham Palace
on Sunday afternoon. All of them.</i>

933
01:05:02,124 --> 01:05:05,249
<i>That girl has been left on her own,
she's on her own up there,</i>

934
01:05:05,291 --> 01:05:07,124
<i>and the place is empty.</i>

935
01:05:07,166 --> 01:05:08,624
Oh, please.

936
01:05:09,124 --> 01:05:12,208
Sleeping in the streets
and pulling out their hair

937
01:05:12,291 --> 01:05:14,291
for someone they never knew?

938
01:05:15,291 --> 01:05:17,458
And they think we're mad?

939
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:20,041
Have you seen
the latest funeral guest list?

940
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,166
No.

941
01:05:21,249 --> 01:05:23,041
I suggest you keep it that way.

942
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:26,291
A chorus line of soap stars
and homosexuals.

943
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:30,499
Apparently, Elton John
is going to be singing.

944
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,291
That'll be a first
for Westminster Abbey.

945
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,791
Condolence books are now
being signed in our embassies

946
01:05:36,874 --> 01:05:39,124
in every major city in the world.

947
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:42,499
And in London alone,
the number has reached 40.

948
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:46,249
It reminds me of one of those films.

949
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:50,249
A few of us in a fort.
Hordes of Zulus outside.

950
01:05:52,124 --> 01:05:56,624
So it's vital you hold firm.
Stick to your guns.

951
01:05:56,666 --> 01:06:01,541
You wait, they will come
to their senses soon. They have to.

952
01:06:02,749 --> 01:06:05,291
Come on, move over, cabbage.

953
01:06:16,666 --> 01:06:18,624
<i>Good morning.
It's 6:00 on Thursday</i>

954
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:20,249
<i>the 4th of September,
I'm Penny Smith.</i>

955
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:21,458
<i>And I'm Matthew Lorenzo.</i>

956
01:06:21,541 --> 01:06:22,850
<i>As the first people start camping out</i>

957
01:06:22,874 --> 01:06:24,874
<i>on the route of Princess Diana's
funeral cortege,</i>

958
01:06:24,958 --> 01:06:27,208
<i>questions are being asked
about why the Queen</i>

959
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:30,874
<i>hasn't addressed her subjects
at this time of national grief.</i>

960
01:06:30,958 --> 01:06:32,892
<i>And this is what the
newspapers are saying this morning.</i>

961
01:06:32,916 --> 01:06:37,041
<i>The Sun, "Where is our Queen?
Where is her flag?"</i>

962
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:47,291
The Express, "Show us you care,"
picture of a grumpy Queen.

963
01:06:47,791 --> 01:06:50,749
The <i>Mail,</i> "Let the flag fly at half mast."

964
01:06:50,791 --> 01:06:54,541
And inside, "The Queen should be here
to show her respects."

965
01:06:55,458 --> 01:07:00,291
But the flip side is, "Blair more
popular now than Churchill. Shock."

966
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,958
But did any of them pick up
on our statement of support?

967
01:07:02,999 --> 01:07:04,916
Well, just the one.

968
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,458
Statements of support
don't sell papers.

969
01:07:13,416 --> 01:07:14,624
Right.

970
01:07:18,749 --> 01:07:20,708
Ma'am? Ma'am?

971
01:07:22,624 --> 01:07:24,708
The Prime Minister for you, ma'am.

972
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:28,291
I'm afraid he's rather insisting.

973
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:32,416
I'll take it in the kitchen.

974
01:07:39,458 --> 01:07:41,458
Good morning,
I'm so sorry to disturb you.

975
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:44,874
I'm just expecting a phone call
to be put through here. Out!

976
01:07:46,624 --> 01:07:48,124
There it is.

977
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,958
Thank you kindly.

978
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:02,166
- Good morning, Prime Minister.
- Good morning, ma'am.

979
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,166
You've seen today's headlines?

980
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:07,291
Yes, I have.

981
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:11,458
Then I'm sure you'll agree
the situation has become

982
01:08:11,833 --> 01:08:13,791
<i>quite critical.</i>

983
01:08:16,166 --> 01:08:19,041
<i>Ma'am, a poll</i>

984
01:08:19,249 --> 01:08:21,541
that's to be published
in tomorrow's papers

985
01:08:21,624 --> 01:08:24,291
suggests that 70% of people believe

986
01:08:24,374 --> 01:08:27,416
that your actions have
damaged the Monarchy.

987
01:08:28,583 --> 01:08:31,874
<i>And that one in four.</i>

988
01:08:32,124 --> 01:08:36,124
<i>Are now in favor of abolishing
the Monarchy altogether.</i>

989
01:08:37,249 --> 01:08:39,458
<i>As your Prime Minister,</i>

990
01:08:40,124 --> 01:08:45,291
I believe it is my constitutional
responsibility to advise

991
01:08:45,499 --> 01:08:47,458
<i>the following.</i>

992
01:09:00,124 --> 01:09:01,999
Is Queen Elizabeth up yet?

993
01:09:08,958 --> 01:09:10,124
Mummy?

994
01:09:11,749 --> 01:09:16,041
One. Fly the flag at half mast
above Buckingham Palace

995
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:18,416
and all other Royal residences.

996
01:09:20,583 --> 01:09:24,916
Two. Leave Balmoral and fly down
to London at the earliest opportunity.

997
01:09:26,458 --> 01:09:27,624
Three.

998
01:09:28,249 --> 01:09:31,166
Pay respects, in person,
at Diana's coffin.

999
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:36,958
And, four.
Make a statement via live television

1000
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:39,124
to my people and the world.

1001
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:44,874
Swift prosecution of these matters
might, he felt,

1002
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:47,749
just might avert disaster.

1003
01:09:48,958 --> 01:09:52,041
You will have to talk to
the Lord Chamberlain about all this.

1004
01:09:52,124 --> 01:09:56,666
I have, and to Robert Fellowes, and
it seems they both agree with Mr. Blair.

1005
01:09:57,499 --> 01:09:58,541
I see.

1006
01:09:58,624 --> 01:10:01,249
Something has happened.
There's been a change.

1007
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:03,791
Some shift in values.

1008
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:08,416
When you no longer understand
your people, Mummy,

1009
01:10:08,458 --> 01:10:11,458
maybe it is time to hand it over
to the next generation.

1010
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:15,999
Don't you be ridiculous.
Remember the vow you took?

1011
01:10:18,541 --> 01:10:22,416
"I declare that my whole life,
whether it be long or short,"

1012
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:24,916
"shall be devoted to your service."

1013
01:10:26,041 --> 01:10:27,624
Your whole life.

1014
01:10:28,249 --> 01:10:31,416
That is a commitment to God
as well as your people.

1015
01:10:31,458 --> 01:10:33,999
But what if my actions
are damaging the Crown?

1016
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,458
Damaging it?

1017
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:39,291
You're the greatest asset
this institution has.

1018
01:10:39,666 --> 01:10:42,208
One of the greatest it has ever had.

1019
01:10:42,624 --> 01:10:43,833
No, no.

1020
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,916
The problem will come when you leave.

1021
01:10:48,249 --> 01:10:50,041
But you mustn't think about that now,

1022
01:10:50,124 --> 01:10:52,624
- and certainly not today.
- Oh, Mummy.

1023
01:10:53,541 --> 01:10:55,458
You must show more strength.

1024
01:10:55,833 --> 01:10:57,583
Reassert your authority.

1025
01:10:59,874 --> 01:11:02,874
You sit on the most powerful throne
in Europe.

1026
01:11:02,999 --> 01:11:07,166
Head of an unbroken line that goes
back more than a thousand years.

1027
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:11,958
Do you think any of your predecessors
would have dropped everything

1028
01:11:12,249 --> 01:11:14,041
and gone up to London

1029
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:19,208
because a bunch of hysterics carrying
candles needed help with their grief?

1030
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:27,249
As for that silly Mr. Blair,
with his Cheshire cat grin...

1031
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:45,291
Mr. Janvrin on the phone for you, sir.

1032
01:11:46,583 --> 01:11:47,624
Yes?

1033
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:49,874
What?

1034
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:52,166
I can't hear!

1035
01:11:53,708 --> 01:11:57,541
Well, that's madness. The whole thing!

1036
01:11:58,458 --> 01:11:59,999
Bloody madness!

1037
01:12:04,458 --> 01:12:05,958
I've just been told.

1038
01:12:07,083 --> 01:12:11,124
You've decided we're to follow
the Prime Minister's advice.

1039
01:12:12,541 --> 01:12:14,291
I just want to say I

1040
01:12:15,916 --> 01:12:17,166
<i>admire...</i>

1041
01:12:20,124 --> 01:12:22,166
I think it's the right decision.

1042
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:26,124
Let's hope we haven't left it too late.

1043
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,999
<i>These are historic shots
that we're witnessing.</i>

1044
01:13:13,083 --> 01:13:15,083
<i>Clearly the Queen
has had a change of heart.</i>

1045
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:19,708
<i>She's clearly responding to the need
to feel that the Royal Family</i>

1046
01:13:19,791 --> 01:13:21,416
<i>is somehow engaged.</i>

1047
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:24,583
<i>These are flowers that have been
brought to the gates of Balmoral</i>

1048
01:13:24,624 --> 01:13:25,999
<i>so that she can actually see</i>

1049
01:13:26,083 --> 01:13:29,499
<i>some token of what's been expressed
down here in London.</i>

1050
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:31,291
Fish fingers, do you want any?

1051
01:13:31,333 --> 01:13:32,624
Be right there.

1052
01:13:37,833 --> 01:13:39,999
Thank God for that!

1053
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,291
I'm afraid they're a bit burnt.

1054
01:14:00,458 --> 01:14:02,208
<i>FFrom CNN International.</i>

1055
01:14:02,291 --> 01:14:06,833
<i>This is World News, with
Ralitsa Vassileva from CNN Center.</i>

1056
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:12,291
<i>Britain's Queen Elizabeth will deliver
a televised address Friday.</i>

1057
01:14:12,333 --> 01:14:15,541
<i>The Royal Family has been accused
of not showing enough remorse</i>

1058
01:14:15,624 --> 01:14:17,041
over Princess Diana's death.

1059
01:14:38,791 --> 01:14:40,833
Where are the boys?
Have they already left?

1060
01:14:40,916 --> 01:14:42,291
Yes.

1061
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:45,416
They left for London
after breakfast, with Charles.

1062
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:48,083
It's not right, you know.

1063
01:14:48,124 --> 01:14:51,583
No, but further discussion is no longer
helpful either.

1064
01:14:52,124 --> 01:14:53,458
Oh, Well.

1065
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:59,083
I suppose it does give the ghillies
time to find another stag for the boys,

1066
01:14:59,333 --> 01:15:01,708
- now theirs has been shot.
- What?

1067
01:15:01,791 --> 01:15:03,249
Haven't you heard?

1068
01:15:03,291 --> 01:15:05,916
He wandered over
to one of the neighboring estates

1069
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:08,458
where one
of the commercial guests got him.

1070
01:15:12,499 --> 01:15:13,749
Really?

1071
01:15:15,749 --> 01:15:17,208
Which estate?

1072
01:15:35,458 --> 01:15:37,041
Here's your box.

1073
01:15:37,749 --> 01:15:39,999
There's some policy unit stuff here
that's important.

1074
01:15:40,083 --> 01:15:41,374
And have you seen the papers?

1075
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:44,059
No, I thought I'd give them the miss
today. Of course I've seen the papers.

1076
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,374
Not bad, eh?

1077
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,416
"Your Majesty, come down to London."

1078
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:49,624
"Who
says so?" "Tony Blair."

1079
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:54,208
Mr. Father of the Nation.

1080
01:16:11,041 --> 01:16:12,208
Ma'am.

1081
01:16:12,791 --> 01:16:14,749
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Morning.

1082
01:16:14,791 --> 01:16:17,083
Is it His Lordship you've come to see?

1083
01:16:17,124 --> 01:16:18,958
No, no, no, please don't disturb him.

1084
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:21,958
No, I've come on another matter.
I hope you don't mind.

1085
01:16:44,291 --> 01:16:45,624
There he is.

1086
01:16:47,958 --> 01:16:49,916
He's a beauty, isn't he?

1087
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,666
An imperial, ma'am.

1088
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,541
Fourteen pointer.

1089
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:07,833
- He was wounded.
- Yes.

1090
01:17:08,791 --> 01:17:12,374
We got our guest in very close,
had him lined up perfect.

1091
01:17:14,124 --> 01:17:15,583
And, Still...

1092
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,083
An investment banker, ma'am,
from London.

1093
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:24,124
I'm afraid the stalkers had to follow
him for miles to finish him off.

1094
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:29,624
Let's hope he didn't suffer too much.

1095
01:17:39,541 --> 01:17:41,916
Please pass my congratulations
to your guest.

1096
01:17:41,958 --> 01:17:43,458
I will, ma'am.

1097
01:17:50,624 --> 01:17:53,749
- God bless you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

1098
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:27,749
Ma'am.

1099
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:29,458
Yes, Robin?

1100
01:18:29,541 --> 01:18:32,583
I've done a draft
of your television address.

1101
01:18:33,291 --> 01:18:34,624
Thank you.

1102
01:18:38,958 --> 01:18:40,916
Was there anything else?

1103
01:18:41,749 --> 01:18:43,124
No, ma'am.

1104
01:18:44,124 --> 01:18:46,041
Landing in 15 minutes.

1105
01:18:57,499 --> 01:18:59,624
I've got the Queen's speech.

1106
01:19:00,124 --> 01:19:01,309
<i>All sorts
of things could've gone wrong.</i>

1107
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:03,434
- Should I give Tony a copy?
- No, let me have a look at it first.

1108
01:19:03,458 --> 01:19:05,208
Okay. He's next door.

1109
01:19:05,291 --> 01:19:07,124
<i>These scenes that began last night,</i>

1110
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,874
<i>beginning to atone
for the hurt of the previous week.</i>

1111
01:19:10,958 --> 01:19:13,124
<i>And the anger,
as somebody said earlier,</i>

1112
01:19:13,166 --> 01:19:15,874
<i>perhaps was just that
people grieving need</i>

1113
01:19:15,958 --> 01:19:18,124
<i>to target their anger at somebody.</i>

1114
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:22,458
<i>And Royal protocol might have been
the thing, it got in the way.</i>

1115
01:19:22,499 --> 01:19:26,416
<i>But Royal protocol is being swept
aside en masse today.</i>

1116
01:19:35,124 --> 01:19:36,749
God bless Diana!

1117
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:43,583
<i>Looked very serious,
Her Majesty and the Duke.</i>

1118
01:19:44,083 --> 01:19:47,791
<i>Normally it is a happy occasion
when they arrive here,</i>

1119
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:50,249
<i>and normally when they're out
at the front here.</i>

1120
01:19:50,291 --> 01:19:53,791
<i>It's days like Trooping the Colour
or VE Day or VJ Day.</i>

1121
01:19:53,874 --> 01:19:55,041
<i>This is a tragic occasion.</i>

1122
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,267
<i>It looks as though
the Queen is about to...</i>

1123
01:19:56,291 --> 01:20:00,208
<i>She is. She's getting out of the car,
Wes, and is going to talk to people.</i>

1124
01:20:00,291 --> 01:20:03,541
<i>It's extremely unusual,
this is almost unprecedented.</i>

1125
01:20:03,624 --> 01:20:05,791
<i>I think perhaps the last time</i>

1126
01:20:05,874 --> 01:20:09,583
<i>the Queen was among her people
outside the Palace</i>

1127
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:12,416
<i>was the day that war in Europe ended.</i>

1128
01:20:12,458 --> 01:20:14,624
<i>It's really, isn't it,
as if the public</i>

1129
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,749
<i>and the Royal Family, the Monarchy,</i>

1130
01:20:16,791 --> 01:20:21,541
<i>have had a quarrel this week and now
it's being healed in some measure.</i>

1131
01:20:22,416 --> 01:20:24,958
<i>Like a family spat. Not unlike</i>

1132
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:28,166
<i>the family spats that they could
acknowledge with Diana.</i>

1133
01:20:28,249 --> 01:20:31,958
<i>I mean, dear Jennie is quite right
to say that whatever the</i>

1134
01:20:31,999 --> 01:20:35,083
<i>professional ups and downs between
the Queen and the Princess...</i>

1135
01:20:35,124 --> 01:20:37,833
They sent a copy
of the Queen's speech.

1136
01:20:39,624 --> 01:20:42,791
Might want to scrape
the frost off it first.

1137
01:20:42,916 --> 01:20:46,124
<i>And I think the Queen is very
generous in recognizing that</i>

1138
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:50,083
<i>her eldest son wasn't always
the easiest chap to be married to.</i>

1139
01:20:50,124 --> 01:20:52,583
I phoned them
with a couple of suggestions

1140
01:20:52,624 --> 01:20:54,624
to make it sound like it came
from a human being.

1141
01:20:54,708 --> 01:20:56,708
Yeah, all right, Alastair.

1142
01:20:56,791 --> 01:20:58,374
<i>She was indifferent...</i>

1143
01:20:58,458 --> 01:21:01,249
Well, at least the old bat has finally
agreed to visit Diana's coffin.

1144
01:21:01,291 --> 01:21:04,583
You know, when you get it wrong,
you really get it wrong.

1145
01:21:04,624 --> 01:21:09,249
That woman has given her whole life
in service to her people.

1146
01:21:09,291 --> 01:21:11,749
Fifty years doing a job
she never wanted.

1147
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:13,916
A job she watched kill her father.

1148
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:18,041
She's executed it with honor,
dignity, and as far as I can tell,

1149
01:21:18,124 --> 01:21:21,416
without a single blemish,
and now we're all baying for her blood!

1150
01:21:21,458 --> 01:21:24,874
All because she's struggling to lead
the world in mourning for someone

1151
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,041
who threw everything she offered
back in her face.

1152
01:21:27,124 --> 01:21:29,708
And who, for the last few years,
seemed committed 24/7

1153
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:32,708
to destroying everything
she holds most dear!

1154
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:40,791
Hello. Would you like me
to place those for you?

1155
01:22:41,291 --> 01:22:42,333
No.

1156
01:22:44,791 --> 01:22:46,666
These are for you.

1157
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:50,249
For me?

1158
01:22:54,291 --> 01:22:55,624
Thank you.

1159
01:22:56,874 --> 01:22:58,624
Thank you very much.

1160
01:23:26,749 --> 01:23:27,916
Ma'am.

1161
01:23:28,749 --> 01:23:31,583
There's been a last minute addition
from Downing Street.

1162
01:23:31,624 --> 01:23:35,791
They're suggesting adding
"and as a grandmother," here.

1163
01:23:35,999 --> 01:23:37,166
Right.

1164
01:23:42,166 --> 01:23:46,249
"So what I say to you now
as your Queen, and as a grandmother."

1165
01:23:47,124 --> 01:23:48,916
"I say from my heart."

1166
01:23:49,291 --> 01:23:50,999
You think you can say it?

1167
01:23:51,791 --> 01:23:52,874
Do I have a choice?

1168
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,374
They're ready for you, Your Majesty.

1169
01:23:57,624 --> 01:23:59,958
Just to confirm. This is going out live.

1170
01:24:00,249 --> 01:24:01,333
Fine.

1171
01:24:01,416 --> 01:24:04,374
And you'll be at the front
of the 6:00 news on all the channels.

1172
01:24:04,458 --> 01:24:05,458
Yes.

1173
01:24:45,833 --> 01:24:46,958
Thank you.

1174
01:24:48,916 --> 01:24:51,624
- Okay, nice and quiet.
- Ten seconds, everyone.

1175
01:24:55,416 --> 01:24:58,624
<i>We cross now live
to Buckingham Palace</i>

1176
01:24:58,791 --> 01:25:01,499
<i>for the Queen's tribute
to Princess Diana.</i>

1177
01:25:08,083 --> 01:25:10,499
<i>Since last Sunday's dreadful news.</i>

1178
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:13,791
<i>We have seen, throughout Britain
and around the world,</i>

1179
01:25:13,874 --> 01:25:17,333
<i>an overwhelming expression
of sadness at Diana's death.</i>

1180
01:25:19,333 --> 01:25:22,791
We have all been trying
in our different ways to cope.

1181
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:26,291
It is not easy to express a sense of loss

1182
01:25:26,458 --> 01:25:27,583
<i>since the initial shock.</i>

1183
01:25:27,624 --> 01:25:30,749
<i>Is often succeeded by a mixture
of other feelings:</i>

1184
01:25:30,958 --> 01:25:34,041
<i>disbelief, incomprehension, anger,</i>

1185
01:25:34,124 --> 01:25:36,499
<i>and concern for those who remain.</i>

1186
01:25:38,624 --> 01:25:41,999
<i>We have all felt those emotions
in these last few days,</i>

1187
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:47,083
<i>so what I say to you now,
as your Queen, and as a grandmother,</i>

1188
01:25:48,083 --> 01:25:49,833
<i>I say from my heart.</i>

1189
01:25:50,791 --> 01:25:54,874
Heart? What heart?
She doesn't mean a word of this.

1190
01:25:55,166 --> 01:25:58,374
That's not the point.
What she's doing is extraordinary.

1191
01:25:58,791 --> 01:26:00,999
<i>In good times and bad she never lost</i>

1192
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:02,850
<i>- her capacity to smile and laugh.
- That's</i> how <i>to survive.</i>

1193
01:26:02,874 --> 01:26:03,999
Listen to you.

1194
01:26:04,083 --> 01:26:07,166
A week ago you were
the great modernizer

1195
01:26:07,333 --> 01:26:10,333
making speeches about
the "people's princess."

1196
01:26:10,583 --> 01:26:12,916
Now you've gone weak at the knees.

1197
01:26:13,791 --> 01:26:16,458
<i>And especially for her devotion
to her two boys...</i>

1198
01:26:16,541 --> 01:26:19,291
You know, I don't know why
I'm so surprised.

1199
01:26:19,749 --> 01:26:24,124
At the end of the day, all Labour Prime
Ministers go ga-ga for the Queen.

1200
01:26:24,999 --> 01:26:26,124
What?

1201
01:26:26,666 --> 01:26:30,083
<i>Millions of others who never met her,
but felt they knew her,</i>

1202
01:26:30,124 --> 01:26:31,791
<i>will remember her.</i>

1203
01:26:32,791 --> 01:26:36,791
<i>I for one, believe that there are
lessons to be drawn from her life</i>

1204
01:26:37,041 --> 01:26:40,749
<i>and from the extraordinary
and moving reaction to her death.</i>

1205
01:26:42,499 --> 01:26:45,791
<i>I share in your determination
to cherish her memory.</i>

1206
01:26:46,916 --> 01:26:50,291
I hope that tomorrow,
we can all, wherever we are,

1207
01:26:50,791 --> 01:26:53,999
<i>join in expressing our grief
at Diana's loss</i>

1208
01:26:54,291 --> 01:26:57,291
<i>and gratitude for her all too short life.</i>

1209
01:26:58,458 --> 01:27:00,791
May those who died rest in peace,

1210
01:27:01,374 --> 01:27:03,916
and may we, each and every one of us,

1211
01:27:04,374 --> 01:27:09,333
<i>thank God for someone who made
many, many people happy.</i>

1212
01:27:16,833 --> 01:27:19,666
<i>Diana's coffin, now on the move.</i>

1213
01:27:19,749 --> 01:27:22,458
<i>The short distance
from St. James's Palace</i>

1214
01:27:22,499 --> 01:27:24,458
<i>to her home at Kensington Palace</i>

1215
01:27:24,499 --> 01:27:27,458
<i>for the final night
before her burial tomorrow.</i>

1216
01:27:28,749 --> 01:27:31,083
<i>It's incredible, less than a week.</i>

1217
01:27:32,083 --> 01:27:34,624
<i>Who could have
imagined such scenes?</i>

1218
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:53,374
<i>Diana was the very
essence of compassion, of duty,</i>

1219
01:28:53,874 --> 01:28:56,041
<i>of style, of beauty.</i>

1220
01:28:56,624 --> 01:29:00,458
<i>A very British girl
who transcended nationality.</i>

1221
01:29:01,291 --> 01:29:04,749
<i>Someone with a natural nobility,
who was classless,</i>

1222
01:29:05,416 --> 01:29:09,291
<i>and who proved, in the last year,
that she needed no Royal title</i>

1223
01:29:09,374 --> 01:29:12,791
<i>to continue to generate her particular
brand of magic.</i>

1224
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:20,624
<i>I would like to end by thanking God
for the small mercies</i>

1225
01:29:20,708 --> 01:29:23,291
<i>he's shown us at this dreadful time,</i>

1226
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:26,333
<i>for taking Diana at her most
beautiful and radiant</i>

1227
01:29:26,416 --> 01:29:29,124
<i>and when she had joy
in her private life.</i>

1228
01:29:29,791 --> 01:29:32,458
<i>Above all, we give thanks for the life
of a woman</i>

1229
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:35,458
<i>I'm so proud to be able
to call my sister,</i>

1230
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:36,749
<i>the unique</i>

1231
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:41,249
<i>the complex, the extraordinary,
and irreplaceable Diana.</i>

1232
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:44,333
<i>Whose beauty,
both internal and external,</i>

1233
01:29:44,833 --> 01:29:47,624
<i>will never be extinguished
from our minds.</i>

1234
01:30:42,458 --> 01:30:44,791
So, off to see your girlfriend?

1235
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:46,458
Now, now.

1236
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:52,041
You know, I hope she shows you
some respect this time.

1237
01:30:52,124 --> 01:30:54,999
It's quite a debt of gratitude
she owes you.

1238
01:30:55,958 --> 01:30:58,124
Mr. Savior of the Monarchy.

1239
01:30:58,583 --> 01:31:00,874
I doubt she'll see it that way.

1240
01:31:06,041 --> 01:31:07,833
- Robin, good to see you.
- Prime Minister.

1241
01:31:07,916 --> 01:31:09,374
Tony, please.

1242
01:31:20,124 --> 01:31:22,458
The Prime Minister, Your Majesty.

1243
01:31:30,624 --> 01:31:33,916
- Do sit down.
- Thank you.

1244
01:31:46,249 --> 01:31:48,749
It's good to see you again

1245
01:31:48,791 --> 01:31:51,583
after what's been quite a summer.

1246
01:31:52,291 --> 01:31:55,458
I'm referring to your visit
to India and Pakistan

1247
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:58,958
where your comments
on ending historic disagreements

1248
01:31:58,999 --> 01:32:00,791
went down very well.

1249
01:32:02,541 --> 01:32:05,624
And the Commonwealth
Heads of Government Meeting...

1250
01:32:05,958 --> 01:32:07,583
I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi

1251
01:32:07,624 --> 01:32:09,708
and he was saying
how much he appreciated

1252
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:12,291
your tough stance on Nigeria.

1253
01:32:12,791 --> 01:32:14,916
I meant to tell you at the time,

1254
01:32:15,958 --> 01:32:18,499
but you were being
monopolized rather.

1255
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:23,749
I imagine those occasions
must be quite difficult.

1256
01:32:24,999 --> 01:32:29,333
Twenty-four heads of government,
each clamoring for a private audience.

1257
01:32:33,416 --> 01:32:37,999
Also, we haven't had a chance to speak
since that week.

1258
01:32:41,291 --> 01:32:43,458
And I wanted to offer my apologies.

1259
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:44,958
Whatever for?

1260
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:49,208
In case you felt manhandled
or managed in any way.

1261
01:32:49,291 --> 01:32:50,791
No. Not at all.

1262
01:32:56,624 --> 01:33:00,333
I don't think I shall ever understand
what happened this summer.

1263
01:33:00,416 --> 01:33:04,458
Well, the circumstances were
exceptional, ma'am.

1264
01:33:05,833 --> 01:33:08,999
And in the end you showed
great personal strength,

1265
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:11,166
courage, and humility.

1266
01:33:11,416 --> 01:33:13,999
You're confusing humility
with humiliation.

1267
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:15,583
That's not true.

1268
01:33:15,624 --> 01:33:16,958
You didn't read the cards.

1269
01:33:16,999 --> 01:33:19,999
On the flowers outside the Palace
that Friday.

1270
01:33:20,291 --> 01:33:23,416
I actually think history will show
it was a good week for you.

1271
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:26,291
And an even better
one for you, Mr. Blair.

1272
01:33:26,749 --> 01:33:29,458
But there are 52 weeks
in the year, ma'am,

1273
01:33:29,958 --> 01:33:33,666
and 2,500 in the time
since you've been Queen.

1274
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:38,624
And when people come to assess
your legacy,

1275
01:33:38,708 --> 01:33:41,249
they won't remember those few days.

1276
01:33:41,291 --> 01:33:42,666
Oh, really?

1277
01:33:43,749 --> 01:33:47,208
You don't think that what affection
people once had for,

1278
01:33:48,458 --> 01:33:52,124
for this institution
has been diminished?

1279
01:33:52,333 --> 01:33:54,291
No. Not at all.

1280
01:33:55,624 --> 01:33:57,874
You're more respected now than ever.

1281
01:33:57,958 --> 01:34:01,958
I gather some of your closest advisers
were less fulsome in their support.

1282
01:34:03,624 --> 01:34:05,124
One or two.

1283
01:34:05,624 --> 01:34:09,374
But as a leader, I could never have
added my voice to that chorus.

1284
01:34:09,458 --> 01:34:10,698
Because you saw those headlines

1285
01:34:10,749 --> 01:34:13,583
and you thought,
"One day, that might happen to me."

1286
01:34:15,916 --> 01:34:17,791
And it will, Mr. Blair.

1287
01:34:17,999 --> 01:34:20,499
Quite suddenly and without warning.

1288
01:34:22,833 --> 01:34:25,833
So, shall we get on
with the business in hand?

1289
01:34:27,541 --> 01:34:28,791
Oh, look.

1290
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:34,958
Oh, I do love this time of clay.
Shall we walk while there's still light?

1291
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:38,749
You know the clocks go back
next week, it'll be dark before 5:00.

1292
01:34:38,791 --> 01:34:40,708
I do hope you're a walker.

1293
01:34:40,791 --> 01:34:42,249
- I am.
- Good.

1294
01:34:42,291 --> 01:34:44,958
I always think these meetings have
a far greater chance of success

1295
01:34:45,041 --> 01:34:47,458
if the Prime Minister is a walker.

1296
01:34:47,791 --> 01:34:50,083
As a matter of fact
it's how I think best, on my feet.

1297
01:34:50,124 --> 01:34:52,874
You know, I've never been one
for sitting around endlessly.

1298
01:34:52,958 --> 01:34:55,999
A good walk and fresh air
sorts everything out.

1299
01:35:01,124 --> 01:35:04,833
One in four, you said,
wanted to get rid of me?

1300
01:35:05,124 --> 01:35:07,041
For about half an hour.

1301
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:11,166
But then you came down to London
and all that went away.

1302
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:16,583
I've never been hated like that before.

1303
01:35:16,749 --> 01:35:19,166
And that must have been difficult.

1304
01:35:19,374 --> 01:35:20,458
Yes.

1305
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:22,916
Very.

1306
01:35:27,124 --> 01:35:31,166
Nowadays, people want glamour
and tears, the grand performance.

1307
01:35:31,249 --> 01:35:34,166
I'm not very good at that.
I never have been.

1308
01:35:34,916 --> 01:35:37,624
I prefer to keep my feelings to myself.

1309
01:35:39,124 --> 01:35:42,208
And, foolishly, I believed that was what
the people wanted from their Queen.

1310
01:35:42,291 --> 01:35:45,708
Not to make a fuss,
nor wear one's heart on one's sleeve.

1311
01:35:45,791 --> 01:35:47,833
Duty first, self second.

1312
01:35:50,124 --> 01:35:52,291
That's how I was brought up.

1313
01:35:53,624 --> 01:35:55,333
That's all I've ever known.

1314
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,124
You were so young
when you became Queen.

1315
01:35:58,499 --> 01:35:59,583
Well...

1316
01:36:04,666 --> 01:36:05,666
Yes.

1317
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:08,958
Yes, a girl.

1318
01:36:15,499 --> 01:36:18,249
But I can see
that the world has changed,

1319
01:36:18,874 --> 01:36:22,124
and one must modernize.

1320
01:36:24,249 --> 01:36:27,791
- Well, perhaps that's where I can help.
- Oh, no.

1321
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:30,791
Don't get ahead of yourself,
Prime Minister.

1322
01:36:30,833 --> 01:36:34,041
Remember, I'm the one
supposed to be advising you.

1323
01:36:38,166 --> 01:36:39,666
Come on, dogs.

1324
01:36:47,374 --> 01:36:51,624
So, tell me, Mr. Blair, what might we
expect from your first parliament?

1325
01:36:52,374 --> 01:36:56,583
Well, Ma'am,
top of the list is education reform.

1326
01:36:56,791 --> 01:37:00,124
We want to radically
reduce classroom sizes.

1327
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:02,291
Oh, yes. Yes, we must.

1328
01:37:02,749 --> 01:37:05,624
Create a much lower
teacher-pupil ratio.

1329
01:37:05,666 --> 01:37:07,666
Yes, it will be difficult to achieve...
