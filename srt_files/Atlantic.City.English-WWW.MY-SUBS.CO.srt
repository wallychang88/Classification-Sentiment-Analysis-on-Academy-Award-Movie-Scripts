1
00:04:56,358 --> 00:05:00,590
Look, it's Ganesh!
It's a sign from heaven.

2
00:06:25,996 --> 00:06:28,863
# Good-bye, little chicks
we are leaving the sticks

3
00:06:28,932 --> 00:06:32,333
# We are catching the train
at a quarter to 6:00

4
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:35,963
# So if anyone should drop around

5
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,008
# Won't you please tell them
that we can be found

6
00:06:39,076 --> 00:06:42,705
# On the boardwalk in Atlantic City

7
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,509
# We will walk in a dream

8
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:49,177
# On the boardwalk in Atlantic City

9
00:06:49,252 --> 00:06:52,710
# Life will be peaches and cream

10
00:06:52,789 --> 00:06:56,020
# There where
there's saltwater air

11
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:59,756
# Brings out the lady's charms

12
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:02,799
# There on the rolling chair

13
00:07:02,866 --> 00:07:05,926
# He'll roll right into your arms

14
00:07:20,183 --> 00:07:22,242
Excuse me, ma'am.
You can't bring those bags in here.

15
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,380
- Oh, we're looking for Sally.
- It's a hotel policy.

16
00:07:26,456 --> 00:07:28,981
She's a really great girl
who works here.

17
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:37,532
Oh, Christ!

18
00:07:41,371 --> 00:07:45,137
Hi. Oh, wow,
it's really good to see you.

19
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,336
I don't want you here.
Get your asses out of here.

20
00:07:48,412 --> 00:07:50,004
When do you finish?

21
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,878
You're not staying with me.

22
00:07:54,117 --> 00:07:57,382
Look, Sally, we've got money.

23
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:59,718
Great. You're in a hotel.
Check in.

24
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,553
We will have money.

25
00:08:12,869 --> 00:08:15,702
- Can you spell me for an hour?
- Yeah, sure.

26
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:19,037
- Who are they?
- My husband and my sister.

27
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:06,047
We drove across Utah.

28
00:09:06,122 --> 00:09:10,525
You'd really love
those waterfalls there, Sally!

29
00:09:10,594 --> 00:09:12,528
And then Colorado.

30
00:09:12,596 --> 00:09:17,260
Did we ever meet some beautiful
Indians that live on a commune.

31
00:09:17,334 --> 00:09:20,360
Did they have
some dynamite mushrooms!

32
00:09:20,437 --> 00:09:22,928
Do you know
even the cows were wrecked?

33
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:25,668
Then we got lost in Louisiana.

34
00:09:37,654 --> 00:09:40,418
Lou, you're late again.
Peppy's very nervous.

35
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:42,515
Peppy knows
he's got an appointment.

36
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:45,390
I'm ringing this bell
like Charles Laughton...

37
00:09:45,462 --> 00:09:47,555
in "The Hunchback of Notre Dame."

38
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:51,727
You want that from me? To become
a hunchback ringing for you?

39
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:53,735
You want hash and eggs?

40
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:57,136
I am nobody's hunchback.
You work for me, Lou!

41
00:09:57,207 --> 00:09:59,937
The cigarettes you put
in your mouth, I pay for.

42
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:03,202
I ring this bell
and you get down here.

43
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,080
- You got no ketchup.
- Why the hell don't you get some?

44
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:49,081
- Don't come where I work!
- I came to see you!

45
00:10:49,154 --> 00:10:51,622
I don't want you following me
or any more of your surprises.

46
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,715
What's going on in there?

47
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:56,420
Dave, leave her alone.
Don't rough her up.

48
00:10:56,495 --> 00:10:58,986
If she doesn't want us,
we can go somewhere else.

49
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,259
It's okay, Chrissie.

50
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,494
Why don't you do
some deep breathing?

51
00:11:03,569 --> 00:11:05,298
Yeah, okay.

52
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,964
He's really a wonderful man, Sally.

53
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:13,338
Why did you do it?
Running away with her...

54
00:11:13,412 --> 00:11:16,540
humiliating me like that?

55
00:11:16,615 --> 00:11:21,314
If you're gonna knock 'em up, pick
somebody who can care of herself.

56
00:11:21,386 --> 00:11:24,287
What do you want me to say...
I'm sorry?

57
00:11:24,356 --> 00:11:26,517
These things happen.

58
00:11:28,293 --> 00:11:31,023
I want you out of here.

59
00:11:31,096 --> 00:11:32,529
I need you.

60
00:11:32,598 --> 00:11:35,396
I don't want you here.

61
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:38,561
What about Chrissie?
She needs you.

62
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:41,902
I'm not taking care
of either of you this time.

63
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:47,569
Are you seeing someone?

64
00:11:47,646 --> 00:11:49,341
Yes, someone.

65
00:11:57,356 --> 00:12:01,053
You screwed me up in Vegas
so I couldn't get a job.

66
00:12:06,264 --> 00:12:08,198
This is what I've decided.

67
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:11,201
After I die, I'm gonna
have Peppy buried in my arms.

68
00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:13,396
Do you think I trust you
to take care of him?

69
00:12:13,472 --> 00:12:16,669
You're not gonna get one nickel
to take care of him after I'm gone.

70
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:19,540
Give me a kiss, Peppy.

71
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:21,636
Little ass kisser!

72
00:12:21,713 --> 00:12:24,546
What are you saying?

73
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:28,845
I said we need more dog food.

74
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,548
- Did you cut the coupons?
- Yes, I cut the coupons.

75
00:12:31,623 --> 00:12:33,716
Shoo! Come on now, Peppy.

76
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:38,485
There were 11 money-saver coupons
in the paper.

77
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:41,225
There's 11 money-saving coupons
in there now.

78
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:43,733
Here, you want to count them?

79
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:46,464
I can't even move my hands anymore.

80
00:12:47,673 --> 00:12:51,541
- I'll rub your fingers for you.
- No, you stay away from me!

81
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:54,943
Last time you shoved my arthritis
clear up to my elbow.

82
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:00,082
Let me get going. It's late.

83
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:08,120
- I'll need five more dollars.
- Five more? You want cigarettes?

84
00:13:08,193 --> 00:13:10,127
You steal cigarettes.

85
00:13:10,195 --> 00:13:12,129
You're the big-time thief...

86
00:13:12,197 --> 00:13:14,495
Mr. Mastermind...

87
00:13:14,566 --> 00:13:17,091
Mr. Ten-Most-Wanted.

88
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,034
That's enough!

89
00:13:21,073 --> 00:13:22,506
Nothing's enough.

90
00:13:32,584 --> 00:13:34,017
Shit!

91
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:43,959
I always wanted shoes with...

92
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:48,728
clear plastic heels
you could see through with...

93
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,826
live goldfish swimming in them.

94
00:13:53,438 --> 00:13:55,668
Wouldn't that be swift?

95
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,844
Have to walk so delicate.

96
00:14:30,108 --> 00:14:33,373
You're like King Midas in reverse.
I don't want you touching my stuff.

97
00:14:33,445 --> 00:14:35,310
You owe me.

98
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:39,914
Get out!

99
00:14:39,985 --> 00:14:42,647
Who got you out
of fucking Saskatchewan?

100
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:47,089
If not for me, you'd be home making
jam, putting out for lumberjacks.

101
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:48,717
Get out!

102
00:14:48,794 --> 00:14:51,092
You smell, you know that?

103
00:14:51,163 --> 00:14:53,529
Like a can of rotten tuna fish.

104
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:32,698
I don't think you smell
of tuna fish.

105
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,300
Are you mad at me
for going off with Dave?

106
00:15:46,585 --> 00:15:51,113
I think of this baby as being ours.
Dave and mine and yours.

107
00:15:52,891 --> 00:15:56,725
Dave's got a much higher developed
soul than either you or me.

108
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:59,320
I've hardly been reincarnated
at all, but Dave...

109
00:15:59,397 --> 00:16:01,991
he can remember all the way back
to ancient Egypt...

110
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:04,535
building the pyramids
and all of that.

111
00:16:04,603 --> 00:16:07,094
He's had some really hard lives.

112
00:16:07,172 --> 00:16:10,539
I think he's due for
a real big break in this one.

113
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,349
You can stay here tonight.

114
00:16:18,416 --> 00:16:19,849
Thanks.

115
00:16:24,155 --> 00:16:26,851
I am not gonna get upset!

116
00:17:16,975 --> 00:17:18,237
Hi, Peppy.

117
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:21,245
- Grace says the usual.
- I know what to give Peppy.

118
00:17:21,313 --> 00:17:22,837
Come on, baby.

119
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:27,316
- A dollar on 123.
- Right.

120
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:32,015
Going out of business, Lou. No sense
playing the numbers anymore.

121
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,217
Ida Cohen, with the six parakeets...

122
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:37,887
won $400 on eight quarters
at the casino.

123
00:17:37,963 --> 00:17:39,555
Got anything for me?

124
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:54,873
- What have you got for me today?
- Got this 421.

125
00:17:54,946 --> 00:17:56,573
4-2-1.

126
00:17:56,648 --> 00:17:58,377
Six bits.

127
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:12,428
Lou! 496.

128
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:18,201
Fifty cents.
Make me a winner, man!

129
00:18:21,506 --> 00:18:22,939
Sadie.

130
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:27,604
- 3-2-1.
- Wish me luck today, Lou.

131
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,977
I will.
Good number, 321.

132
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:45,396
Place your bets.

133
00:18:47,732 --> 00:18:49,825
No more bets.

134
00:19:00,345 --> 00:19:03,280
- You looked!
- You spilled your drink!

135
00:19:03,348 --> 00:19:07,944
No, you took your eyes up.
You allowed me to distract you!

136
00:19:09,254 --> 00:19:11,279
Everyone, listen to me.

137
00:19:13,858 --> 00:19:16,725
The players are coming
to the casino in teams.

138
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:18,729
One sits here,
one sits there.

139
00:19:18,797 --> 00:19:20,731
The cards are good.

140
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,097
The player at the first base
spills his drink.

141
00:19:23,168 --> 00:19:24,635
Your eye moves.

142
00:19:24,702 --> 00:19:27,899
The player at the third base
triples his bets.

143
00:19:28,907 --> 00:19:32,308
They have a million clever ways
of trying to cheat you.

144
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:36,077
Focus!

145
00:19:37,148 --> 00:19:40,117
Concentrate! Concentrate.

146
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,321
Go ahead.

147
00:19:58,336 --> 00:20:00,827
Darling, you were late.

148
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:02,338
Family.

149
00:20:03,341 --> 00:20:05,502
Did you like the music?

150
00:20:05,577 --> 00:20:08,808
Marvelous music...
"Norma Casta Diva."

151
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,849
The chaste goddess
worshipping the moon.

152
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:15,110
Yeah, I'm beginning to like it.

153
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:18,314
Dignity, passion, size.

154
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:22,925
Can I lay a hard ten
on a soft three?

155
00:20:40,812 --> 00:20:42,245
Yep.

156
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:45,906
Yeah, okay. Bye.

157
00:20:46,918 --> 00:20:50,012
- Forty-eight dollars and six bits.
- You're down this week.

158
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:52,420
Everybody's broke.
I got any winners?

159
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:56,051
Better not have.
I can't afford fucking winners.

160
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:04,562
Freddy, how 'bout a double sawbuck
for the case? It's a real beauty.

161
00:21:05,637 --> 00:21:09,073
How am I supposed to fit my Cuban
Monte Cristos in this piece of shit?

162
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,007
Where are you coming from?

163
00:21:17,715 --> 00:21:21,617
- Do you know a Fred O'Reilly?
- Fred's right over there.

164
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:23,881
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

165
00:21:27,091 --> 00:21:30,993
Hi, you Fred O'Reilly?

166
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:32,495
Yeah. Who are you?

167
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:37,399
Something new, huh?
Let me see. Very nice.

168
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:40,835
- I won $300 at the casino.
- Casino.

169
00:21:40,905 --> 00:21:42,463
Hey, Queenie.

170
00:22:02,994 --> 00:22:05,656
Hey, man, I need a little space
around here.

171
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:07,925
Come on!
I got business!

172
00:22:13,605 --> 00:22:15,630
Let's take a look.

173
00:22:22,113 --> 00:22:23,944
There you go.

174
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:38,054
Very nice.

175
00:22:45,169 --> 00:22:47,694
Very nice indeed.

176
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:50,172
There's been a slight dry spell
around here.

177
00:22:50,241 --> 00:22:53,335
Dry spell's over.
White Christmas, perfect timing.

178
00:22:53,411 --> 00:22:56,403
A friend called this a.m.
Could I help him?

179
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:58,711
Had to say no.

180
00:22:58,783 --> 00:23:01,547
- Where'd you get this?
- I found it in a phone booth.

181
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:05,077
- In Philadelphia?
- How did you know?

182
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:09,351
I'll help your friend.

183
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:12,191
Not looking like that, you won't.

184
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:19,131
This is a family town.
Better get yourself cleaned up.

185
00:23:19,203 --> 00:23:22,297
A nice leisure suit, powder blue.

186
00:23:23,207 --> 00:23:27,166
- You don't need a tie.
- Maybe you could advance me.

187
00:23:27,245 --> 00:23:31,443
You know, $200? $300?
You know I'm good for it.

188
00:23:31,516 --> 00:23:34,849
This is a very tight town.

189
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,650
I only do business with the people
I do business with.

190
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:41,055
The people I do business with
find out I do business...

191
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,094
with the people
I don't do business with...

192
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:47,564
I can't do business with you.

193
00:23:47,632 --> 00:23:49,964
But Boomer in Vegas said...

194
00:23:50,034 --> 00:23:53,197
I don't do business
with Boomer in Vegas.

195
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:56,573
You look like a fire sale.

196
00:23:56,641 --> 00:23:58,905
Look...

197
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,638
I've been on the road six weeks.

198
00:24:01,713 --> 00:24:04,011
You clean me up,
I'm a fuckin' Prince Charles.

199
00:24:05,917 --> 00:24:09,580
You won't help me?
Look, I'm cutting you in!

200
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:22,095
I sure would like
to help my friend.

201
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:28,672
But remember,
I don't do business with you.

202
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:38,614
Shit!

203
00:24:44,555 --> 00:24:46,420
You got a phone?

204
00:24:46,491 --> 00:24:48,322
Telephone is upstairs.

205
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:53,126
Wait a minute. Let him use
the bar phone. I know the kid.

206
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,765
Find the place
you were looking for?

207
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,935
We live in the same building.

208
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:11,811
That's why I'm talking to you,
because we live in the same...

209
00:25:11,883 --> 00:25:15,216
Yeah, Fred gave me your number.

210
00:25:17,422 --> 00:25:20,289
Hey, Bob! Beer.

211
00:25:20,358 --> 00:25:22,349
Cold one this time.

212
00:25:22,427 --> 00:25:24,361
Okay, I'll be there.

213
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:36,599
- Your friend wants to do business.
- They'll bust you in the lobby.

214
00:25:36,674 --> 00:25:40,542
You look like a training poster
from the narc squad.

215
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:42,044
Powder blue leisure suit.

216
00:25:42,113 --> 00:25:45,446
Hey, Lou. I want you to run
an errand for me.

217
00:25:45,516 --> 00:25:47,484
I'm booked up.

218
00:25:48,453 --> 00:25:50,353
Who's the old guy?

219
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:51,892
- You mean Lou?
- Yeah.

220
00:25:52,289 --> 00:25:55,086
He used to run numbers
for the dinosaurs.

221
00:26:04,702 --> 00:26:06,636
Hey, why did you leave?

222
00:26:06,704 --> 00:26:10,231
Back there we started talking.
I had other things on my mind.

223
00:26:10,308 --> 00:26:13,072
I was just trying to be friendly
so piss off!

224
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:19,672
Listen, I hear you're very big
in circles around here.

225
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,217
Where'd you hear that?

226
00:26:21,285 --> 00:26:23,879
Vegas. Las Vegas.

227
00:26:27,291 --> 00:26:29,225
You heard about me in Vegas?

228
00:26:29,293 --> 00:26:32,558
Oh, yeah! The man to know!

229
00:26:33,698 --> 00:26:35,893
Let me understand something, kid.

230
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:39,300
You're talking about
Las Vegas, Nevada?

231
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,099
Right, yeah.

232
00:26:41,172 --> 00:26:43,572
That I was the man to know?

233
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:45,404
Lou, right?

234
00:26:46,143 --> 00:26:48,111
Class dismissed.

235
00:27:00,124 --> 00:27:01,557
Come on, Peppy.

236
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:05,057
Come on, you little mutt.

237
00:27:06,764 --> 00:27:10,666
This ain't my dog.
Belongs to the lady downstairs.

238
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:14,398
I'm more of a German shepherd type
of guy. Isn't that right, Peppy?

239
00:27:14,472 --> 00:27:16,497
Doin' the old lady a favor.

240
00:27:19,844 --> 00:27:21,937
There's the building.

241
00:27:22,013 --> 00:27:25,107
A shame you never saw it
in the old days, a real work of art.

242
00:27:25,182 --> 00:27:28,117
They're gonna tear it down now
and build a casino.

243
00:27:30,321 --> 00:27:34,485
Lou, could I borrow your apartment?

244
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,992
My apartment?

245
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,325
Yeah, just for an hour. There's
a hundred bucks in it for you.

246
00:27:39,397 --> 00:27:41,661
- A hundred bucks?
- Yeah.

247
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:43,666
Let me tell you something, kiddo.

248
00:27:43,734 --> 00:27:46,532
My room ain't exactly
the royal suite of Mr. Casanova.

249
00:27:46,604 --> 00:27:48,936
No, no, it's not for a girl.

250
00:27:49,006 --> 00:27:51,201
It's technical, business.

251
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:55,470
Who was it told you about me
in Vegas?

252
00:27:55,546 --> 00:27:59,949
Well, you know, it was in a crowd
of people, your name popped up.

253
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:01,746
Tall fella?

254
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:04,117
Yeah, yeah, that's the one.

255
00:28:05,823 --> 00:28:07,848
Harry Gropke.

256
00:28:07,925 --> 00:28:11,691
Harry went to Vegas, I think.
It must have been Harry.

257
00:28:11,762 --> 00:28:14,526
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Harry.

258
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:17,966
You know something?
I've known Harry for thirty years.

259
00:28:18,035 --> 00:28:21,095
- I haven't seen him in twenty-five.
- Yeah?

260
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:25,868
"I adore attractive,
well-groomed educated women:

261
00:28:27,211 --> 00:28:29,839
"You mean,
making the church scene?

262
00:28:29,914 --> 00:28:33,215
"Forget it, Reverend:
I'm not resting!

263
00:28:40,992 --> 00:28:42,425
Here we are.

264
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:44,757
No strangers in here!

265
00:28:44,829 --> 00:28:46,257
That's Dave.
He's staying upstairs.

266
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:48,723
He's from Las Vegas.
Good friend of Harry Gropke's.

267
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:51,833
- I've got business to discuss.
- Not now, Grace. Later.

268
00:28:51,902 --> 00:28:55,599
Where's Cookie's silver cigarette
case? It was here by my bed.

269
00:28:55,673 --> 00:28:58,972
- I see you got a scale.
- Weight Watchers. Measures food.

270
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,635
Get it for me.

271
00:29:00,711 --> 00:29:05,546
Lou, you get back here. You've got
to push the blood back in my feet.

272
00:29:05,616 --> 00:29:07,550
I'll be right back.

273
00:29:08,853 --> 00:29:10,912
Lou, come back!

274
00:29:18,863 --> 00:29:20,660
Come in, come in.

275
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:36,942
Would you close the blinds?

276
00:29:46,957 --> 00:29:49,585
I need a tablespoon.

277
00:29:53,164 --> 00:29:55,257
That's great. Thanks.

278
00:30:01,439 --> 00:30:03,498
Italian baby laxative.

279
00:30:04,842 --> 00:30:06,833
That's what it is.

280
00:30:18,622 --> 00:30:20,886
You like magic?

281
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:26,855
Pass your hand over the scale.

282
00:30:26,931 --> 00:30:28,626
What?

283
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,031
Come on! Go on! Do it.

284
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:34,236
That's $2,000.

285
00:30:35,673 --> 00:30:37,470
Two thousand dollars?

286
00:30:40,878 --> 00:30:43,210
Okay, say abracadabra.

287
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,215
- Come on.
- Come on, say it!

288
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:48,911
Abracadabra.

289
00:30:55,426 --> 00:30:57,189
That's $4,000.

290
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:18,341
Could you stash this
for me somewhere?

291
00:31:18,415 --> 00:31:21,043
- Jeez, I don't know.
- It's only for a couple hours.

292
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:29,350
Look, you know the streets here.
Could you walk me?

293
00:31:29,426 --> 00:31:31,621
I can't leave Grace.

294
00:31:31,695 --> 00:31:34,061
Are you afraid?

295
00:31:34,131 --> 00:31:36,156
I've got a medical problem with her.

296
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:38,463
- Are you a doctor?
- Doctor?

297
00:31:38,536 --> 00:31:42,996
There's something wrong with
the feet. The blood don't flow good.

298
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:45,735
Why don't you tell me?
Come on.

299
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:49,974
- Wait a minute.
- Chrissie, I got a job for ya!

300
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,675
Got your fingers warmed up?

301
00:31:55,753 --> 00:31:59,689
This is not Grand Central Station.
What's wrong with you today?

302
00:31:59,757 --> 00:32:03,386
These people are going to help you.
Come on, Peppy, you're in the way.

303
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,087
You're fired, Lou.

304
00:32:05,162 --> 00:32:07,630
Dave, this lady's got a
million things wrong with her.

305
00:32:07,698 --> 00:32:09,859
Get her out of here.

306
00:32:09,934 --> 00:32:14,769
This lady is almost a qualified
therapist in Nevada and Oklahoma.

307
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:18,969
She trained in Saskatchewan, Canada,
in the art of Korean foot massage.

308
00:32:19,043 --> 00:32:22,308
If you leave me alone with her,
I'm gonna kill you, Lou.

309
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:26,645
Will you listen for just once?
This is not medicine.

310
00:32:26,717 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm still a very important woman
in this town.

311
00:32:30,521 --> 00:32:33,490
I'm Cookie Pinza's widow.

312
00:32:34,525 --> 00:32:38,291
He used to deliver coffee
for Cookie.

313
00:32:41,332 --> 00:32:43,266
He's my servant.

314
00:32:43,334 --> 00:32:47,430
Do you know that your whole body
ends at the bottom of your feet?

315
00:32:47,504 --> 00:32:50,439
You think I am just poking
your feet.

316
00:32:50,507 --> 00:32:55,501
Well, when I touch this spot,
this is where your spine is.

317
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:59,845
When I touch this spot,
this is where your tummy is.

318
00:32:59,984 --> 00:33:02,817
You work for that Grace?

319
00:33:02,887 --> 00:33:04,479
I help her out.

320
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:06,682
She pays you?

321
00:33:06,757 --> 00:33:11,592
You're her fancy man?
Are you servicing her?

322
00:33:11,662 --> 00:33:13,391
Every now and then.

323
00:33:13,464 --> 00:33:16,592
Wow. To be your age
and still working at it.

324
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,659
Mr. Stud! Mr. John!

325
00:33:19,737 --> 00:33:23,400
Well, I keep myself in trim.

326
00:33:23,474 --> 00:33:26,568
Monte Carlo!

327
00:33:26,644 --> 00:33:30,978
The old casino is very, very slow
and old-fashioned.

328
00:33:31,048 --> 00:33:33,949
Rococo elegance. But the new casino
is just like Vegas.

329
00:33:34,018 --> 00:33:35,212
Really?

330
00:33:35,286 --> 00:33:39,985
The croupiers are French, but the
dealers are American from Vegas.

331
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:46,488
You get your license to learn how to
deal and the world opens up to you.

332
00:33:49,466 --> 00:33:54,130
It's not just cards, you know.
It's your future.

333
00:33:55,472 --> 00:33:58,339
I want you to concentrate.

334
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:01,537
I hate you going back
to that oyster bar.

335
00:34:01,612 --> 00:34:03,876
The world should be your oyster.

336
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:08,879
Well, I've got so much to learn.
I don't know how to count in French.

337
00:34:08,953 --> 00:34:10,045
I know...

338
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:17,458
Do you think you could teach me?

339
00:34:17,528 --> 00:34:19,553
Better than that.

340
00:34:24,802 --> 00:34:27,430
If you'd only stop being afraid.

341
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:30,098
Deal with courage.

342
00:34:30,174 --> 00:34:33,371
You're a little pearl
produced by that oyster bar.

343
00:34:35,479 --> 00:34:37,413
Say that in French.

344
00:34:58,936 --> 00:35:01,632
The name Capone
mean anything to you?

345
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:04,173
Al Capone? The Godfather?

346
00:35:04,241 --> 00:35:07,142
Lucky Luciano, Dutch Schultz,
Meyer Lansky.

347
00:35:07,211 --> 00:35:09,145
Do you know them?

348
00:35:09,213 --> 00:35:11,875
You work for the people
who work for the people.

349
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:14,474
I was taken a shine to.

350
00:35:14,551 --> 00:35:18,180
Pardon me, but you don't exactly
look like the "King of the Mobs."

351
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:24,022
Well, a few wrong turns,
wrong affections, some mistakes.

352
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,926
It's all shit now.

353
00:35:27,998 --> 00:35:31,399
It's a shame you never saw
Atlantic City when it had floy floy.

354
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:34,596
Remember the song, "Flatfoot Floogie
with the Floy Floy"?

355
00:35:34,671 --> 00:35:37,765
Hep cat and zoot suit.
That was the floogie part.

356
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:39,832
The floy floy.

357
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,140
That was something special.

358
00:35:42,212 --> 00:35:45,579
Atlantic City had floy floy coming
out of its ears in those days.

359
00:35:46,984 --> 00:35:49,282
Now it's all so goddamn legal.

360
00:35:49,353 --> 00:35:51,719
Howard Johnson running a casino.

361
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:54,986
Tutti-frutti ice cream
and craps don't mix.

362
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:59,393
The only difference between
Christianity and Hare Krishna is...

363
00:35:59,463 --> 00:36:01,397
Hare Krishna is real.

364
00:36:01,465 --> 00:36:05,162
If Jesus was alive today,
he'd be very much into Hare Krishna.

365
00:36:05,235 --> 00:36:06,872
- Chrissie!
- Yeah?

366
00:36:07,104 --> 00:36:09,334
Do my sinuses again.

367
00:36:13,444 --> 00:36:15,378
- What language is that?
- French.

368
00:36:17,448 --> 00:36:19,109
Is it hard, French?

369
00:36:19,183 --> 00:36:21,981
It's the language
of international diplomacy.

370
00:36:28,192 --> 00:36:30,660
It's nice, French.

371
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:32,695
Your husband's a real cutie!

372
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,697
He's leaving tomorrow.

373
00:36:43,841 --> 00:36:46,071
Have you seen my wallet?

374
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:54,407
I can't find my wallet.

375
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,088
We go this way.

376
00:36:59,656 --> 00:37:02,124
Yes, it used to be beautiful...

377
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:06,959
what with the rackets,
the whoring, guns.

378
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,021
Sometimes...

379
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:12,330
Sometimes things would happen,
I'd have to kill a few people.

380
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:16,498
I'd feel bad for a while, but I'd
jump into the ocean, swim way out.

381
00:37:16,573 --> 00:37:20,134
Come back in feeling nice and clean,
start all over again.

382
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:24,144
I never seen the Atlantic Ocean
till just now.

383
00:37:24,214 --> 00:37:26,682
The Atlantic Ocean
was something then.

384
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:31,451
Yeah, you should've seen
the Atlantic Ocean in those days.

385
00:37:33,423 --> 00:37:35,050
Come on.

386
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:41,559
There's your hotel.

387
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:44,863
I could like it here.
You can breathe.

388
00:37:46,403 --> 00:37:49,167
They used to call Atlantic City
the lungs of Philadelphia.

389
00:37:52,009 --> 00:37:55,501
We stay long enough, we could be
the nose of Philadelphia.

390
00:38:01,518 --> 00:38:03,679
- What room?
- 307.

391
00:38:07,224 --> 00:38:09,818
Look, you go up alone.

392
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:11,656
What do you mean?

393
00:38:11,728 --> 00:38:14,162
Just hand him this.
I'll wait outside.

394
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:15,994
Ain't you comin' with me?

395
00:38:16,066 --> 00:38:19,695
I can't. Not the way I'm dressed.
I mean, you look sharp.

396
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:21,704
You ain't trying to set me up.

397
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:25,299
I'm trusting you.
I left a fortune in your apartment.

398
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:29,191
Look, you just give him
the package.

399
00:38:29,379 --> 00:38:31,488
You wait for an envelope
with the money.

400
00:38:31,689 --> 00:38:33,948
There's another 100 for ya.

401
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:35,808
Can't you do it?

402
00:38:43,627 --> 00:38:45,822
You better get yourself
some new clothes.

403
00:38:45,896 --> 00:38:48,262
Tomorrow. Floy floy.

404
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,429
- 307?
- Right.

405
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:53,560
I'll be up on the boardwalk.

406
00:39:21,498 --> 00:39:23,159
I got a...

407
00:39:31,875 --> 00:39:34,036
I've got a package from Dave.

408
00:39:37,147 --> 00:39:39,980
What, is medicare dealing now?
Come on in.

409
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,994
Everybody in?

410
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,922
Pair of fives.

411
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,939
Fella here wants to talk to you.

412
00:40:31,702 --> 00:40:34,034
Hey, man, what's going on?

413
00:40:48,251 --> 00:40:51,687
We'd like you to keep it going
if you don't mind.

414
00:42:01,024 --> 00:42:04,790
There's a lot of other people
we gotta see first.

415
00:42:04,861 --> 00:42:07,591
The whole East Coast
is like the Sahara Desert.

416
00:42:07,664 --> 00:42:09,996
Every source is dried up.
You old "kocker" you.

417
00:42:10,066 --> 00:42:12,432
Tell me.
Where'd you get this stuff?

418
00:42:12,502 --> 00:42:13,992
Medicare.

419
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:18,234
All right. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to offend you.

420
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:21,903
I'm trying to hold a game together.
I'm calling everywhere.

421
00:42:21,978 --> 00:42:23,673
Four G's.

422
00:42:24,948 --> 00:42:26,882
I know. Four G's.

423
00:42:29,052 --> 00:42:31,145
Tomorrow, huh?

424
00:43:02,152 --> 00:43:03,585
Lou Pascal?

425
00:43:08,725 --> 00:43:11,125
Buddy. Buddy O'Brien!

426
00:43:11,194 --> 00:43:14,357
That's me!
You're lookin' great, Lou.

427
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:16,023
How you doir?

428
00:43:16,099 --> 00:43:18,567
Fine. I'm doin' perfect.

429
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:23,833
It's good to see you, Buddy.
Oh, here. There we are.

430
00:43:23,907 --> 00:43:26,501
Hey, hey, not from you, I don't.

431
00:43:26,576 --> 00:43:30,239
Go on, take it.
It's a good time for me.

432
00:43:32,115 --> 00:43:34,140
Get in the chair.
I'll give you a shine.

433
00:43:48,331 --> 00:43:50,265
- It's a long time.
- Yeah.

434
00:43:52,936 --> 00:43:55,131
Remember the day
Nucky Johnson sent us...

435
00:43:55,205 --> 00:43:58,003
to buy 100 boxes of rubbers
for the party?

436
00:43:59,943 --> 00:44:01,877
The look the guy gave us!

437
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:04,846
A hundred boxes of rubbers
for two guys.

438
00:44:04,915 --> 00:44:06,940
He couldn't get over it.

439
00:44:08,852 --> 00:44:11,013
Buddy, you live too much
in the past.

440
00:44:11,087 --> 00:44:14,488
Yeah. But them were the days.

441
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:59,735
Mrs. Matthews?

442
00:44:59,803 --> 00:45:01,236
Yes.

443
00:45:02,472 --> 00:45:05,066
Great! Where did you find it?

444
00:45:10,146 --> 00:45:12,376
I have a vision of the future.

445
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:15,350
This glorious island
of Atlantic City...

446
00:45:15,418 --> 00:45:19,286
shining like a beacon whose light
was nearly extinguished.

447
00:45:19,356 --> 00:45:23,383
If it wasn't for the casinos,
we'd have been dead a long time ago.

448
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,055
And so I accept with great pleasure
this check from all the casinos.

449
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:31,294
- Thank you, Mr. Goulet.
- You're welcome, Doctor.

450
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:33,598
I want to thank the people
whose money I had for a while.

451
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:36,298
Last night I was lucky at the tables
but on the way home...

452
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:41,140
on the boardwalk,
I was mugged by my own croupier!

453
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:04,031
# Just flew into town tonight

454
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:07,501
# Lady Luck was on our flight

455
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,504
# Had a bite to eat

456
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:11,802
# At Geno's down the street

457
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:15,675
# And now this welcome sight

458
00:46:15,745 --> 00:46:19,306
# Glad to see you're born again

459
00:46:19,382 --> 00:46:23,079
# Atlantic City, my old friend

460
00:46:23,153 --> 00:46:25,087
# Be there when I bet on ten

461
00:46:26,623 --> 00:46:29,290
You're not planning
on leaving town yourself, are you?

462
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:32,726
I want to make it here. I really
like this town. I wanna be a dealer.

463
00:46:32,796 --> 00:46:35,321
I think Atlantic City's the greatest.

464
00:46:35,398 --> 00:46:37,559
- Mrs. Matthews, you...
- What?

465
00:46:37,634 --> 00:46:39,568
You can claim the body tomorrow.

466
00:46:39,636 --> 00:46:42,366
I don't want the body!

467
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:47,204
# And now you're here to stay

468
00:46:47,277 --> 00:46:50,804
# Remember how they put you down

469
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,976
# There's not an empty room in town

470
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:58,020
# They're coming here
from miles around

471
00:46:58,088 --> 00:47:00,386
# You sure came through

472
00:47:03,426 --> 00:47:07,419
# I'm glad to see you're born again

473
00:47:07,497 --> 00:47:09,692
Saskatchewan. Area code 306...

474
00:47:14,437 --> 00:47:19,238
- To Mr. Or Mrs. Peter Matthews.
- # You're back upon the map again

475
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,072
Sally Matthews.

476
00:47:21,144 --> 00:47:24,204
# You sure came through

477
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:27,272
What do you mean they won't accept
the charges? It's about their son.

478
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:30,080
Hello? Dave's dead. Hello!

479
00:47:38,161 --> 00:47:40,629
- I heard about Dave. I'm sorry.
- Who are...

480
00:47:40,697 --> 00:47:43,097
We live in the same building.
Next door.

481
00:47:45,135 --> 00:47:47,569
Come on, I'll walk you home.

482
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:53,541
I don't know what to do about his
body. I tried calling his parents.

483
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,544
They wouldn't even accept
the charges.

484
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:59,343
- They've got to know.
- I don't have any money.

485
00:48:01,317 --> 00:48:03,444
Don't worry about it.
Come on.

486
00:48:18,768 --> 00:48:20,463
I can't. I, I...

487
00:48:23,139 --> 00:48:26,131
Hello? Mr. Matthews?

488
00:48:26,209 --> 00:48:29,508
I was a friend of your son Dave.

489
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:32,980
My name... My name is Lou.

490
00:48:33,049 --> 00:48:37,748
I'm sorry to have to tell you.
There's been a very bad accident.

491
00:48:42,292 --> 00:48:44,351
Can I take your order?

492
00:48:44,427 --> 00:48:46,793
Just some water, please.

493
00:48:57,907 --> 00:49:01,206
The news didn't exactly break their
hearts, but at least they know.

494
00:49:04,547 --> 00:49:08,381
I've been thinking about
the burial and disposal.

495
00:49:09,452 --> 00:49:12,012
You're gonna need help.

496
00:49:12,088 --> 00:49:14,989
I hate to bring this up, but...

497
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:17,322
when something like this happens...

498
00:49:17,393 --> 00:49:19,418
there's certain things
you've got to do.

499
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:21,429
And you're new in this town.

500
00:49:22,732 --> 00:49:24,256
Christ!

501
00:49:31,007 --> 00:49:33,703
Remember, I'm Lou Pascal
if there's anything you need.

502
00:49:33,776 --> 00:49:36,506
I know your name from the mailbox.
I got a piece of your mail once.

503
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:39,639
- I slipped it under your door.
- Oh, was that you?

504
00:49:39,716 --> 00:49:43,117
It was just junk mail,
but I appreciate what you did.

505
00:49:43,186 --> 00:49:46,019
Coupons for paper towels.
You saved me money.

506
00:49:48,157 --> 00:49:51,217
- I'm Sally Matthews.
- I know.

507
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:54,024
Thanks very much
for everything, really.

508
00:49:54,097 --> 00:49:55,758
It's okay.

509
00:50:01,204 --> 00:50:03,695
God, I don't know
what to say to my sister.

510
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:10,506
Look, your sister is downstairs
baby-sitting Grace... Mrs. Pinza.

511
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:13,481
Why don't you go to bed, get
some rest, tell her in the morning?

512
00:50:13,549 --> 00:50:15,574
Young girls are strong.

513
00:50:15,652 --> 00:50:17,483
Yeah.

514
00:50:17,553 --> 00:50:21,379
Good night.

515
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:04,699
Jesus.

516
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:12,093
You can go upstairs now.

517
00:53:13,565 --> 00:53:15,465
All right, all right.

518
00:53:18,303 --> 00:53:19,895
Your sister is back.

519
00:54:16,928 --> 00:54:19,192
What's got into you?

520
00:56:00,598 --> 00:56:02,031
Shit!

521
00:56:03,534 --> 00:56:06,332
- Where are my oysters?
- Relax.

522
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:09,464
Well, at least you got
your wallet back.

523
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:14,034
Last night I dreamt I came here
and Dave's body was on the ice.

524
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,575
- Sign this.
- What is it?

525
00:56:18,650 --> 00:56:21,710
It's for your husband.
Sign here and here.

526
00:56:21,786 --> 00:56:24,516
- But what...
- Believe me, it's all right.

527
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:28,548
And put down the address,
the family address in Canada.

528
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:33,595
- What did you do to your hand?
- Nothing.

529
00:56:34,966 --> 00:56:37,958
- What time do you get off?
- 12:00.

530
00:56:40,638 --> 00:56:43,368
Terrific. I'll see you.

531
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,438
Holy shit!

532
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:17,565
Santa Claus is looking real hot.
Come on in.

533
00:57:17,642 --> 00:57:21,840
Everybody, hold it. Let's have
a little applause for Santa Claus.

534
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:24,981
Gentlemen.

535
00:57:25,883 --> 00:57:29,341
Go ahead.
Compliments of the house.

536
00:57:30,421 --> 00:57:34,357
Hey, Pops, what planet
do you come from?

537
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:39,124
I want to do something for ya.
Here, take my watch. Go ahead.

538
00:57:40,598 --> 00:57:43,761
You don't want it? Take my wife!
Take my life! Take anything!

539
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,702
Just cut out the bullshit.
Let me have the money.

540
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,443
You're all right, Pops.

541
00:58:02,887 --> 00:58:05,219
Not bad. Not bad.

542
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:11,355
Couple of inches off the sleeves,
a little off the skirt...

543
00:58:11,429 --> 00:58:13,397
and you'll look just fine.

544
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:15,932
For the tailor.

545
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,993
Double sawbuck?
Hey, thanks a lot!

546
00:58:20,071 --> 00:58:23,131
Listen, when things start going good
for me, I'll make it up to you.

547
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:32,274
A dozen oysters, please.

548
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:34,944
- Hi.
- I took care of Dave.

549
00:58:35,019 --> 00:58:38,386
The forms you signed, they were
releases to send the body to Canada.

550
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:43,086
You were busy, and the arrangements,
mail, the plane, it's a lot of work.

551
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:46,062
You paid to have his body
flown to Canada?

552
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,893
I hope you don't mind.

553
00:58:47,965 --> 00:58:52,629
- The money! Must've been expensive.
- Forget the money. I'm a neighbor.

554
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:56,106
Why are you doing all this?

555
00:58:56,174 --> 00:58:59,234
It's nothing!
Sinatra gives wings to hospitals.

556
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:01,710
We all do what we can.

557
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:04,339
- It's 12:00.
- Yeah?

558
00:59:04,415 --> 00:59:06,406
I'll wait for you.

559
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:13,183
There's four extra in there.

560
00:59:13,257 --> 00:59:16,454
They're really strict here. They
count the shells. I'm not kidding.

561
00:59:16,527 --> 00:59:19,655
I don't really want these, honey.
We're going to lunch.

562
00:59:19,730 --> 00:59:21,630
Hey, thanks!

563
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:32,936
New casino.

564
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:37,276
Burger King casinos. McDonald's
casinos. Pizzeria casinos. Jesus!

565
00:59:37,348 --> 00:59:40,010
Where I work they rake in
over a million bucks a day.

566
00:59:40,084 --> 00:59:42,075
- Really?
- Yeah.

567
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,523
You like the casinos?
You go to them?

568
00:59:48,593 --> 00:59:51,221
No. No, I don't like them.

569
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:54,321
They're too wholesome for me.

570
00:59:54,398 --> 00:59:58,528
I mean nuns, for Christ sake,
standing in line. Boy Scout troops.

571
00:59:58,603 --> 01:00:01,936
People blowing their...
their welfare checks.

572
01:00:02,006 --> 01:00:04,736
It's too much nickel-and-diming.

573
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,438
All that money you carry around,
that's no nickel-and-diming.

574
01:00:08,513 --> 01:00:10,572
It quiets the nerves.

575
01:00:11,883 --> 01:00:16,320
Why do you live in the same dump
I do when you could afford a palace?

576
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:17,820
Well, I...

577
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:22,050
To tell you the truth,
I stay there for Grace.

578
01:00:22,126 --> 01:00:26,756
When they tear it down, I'll take
Grace someplace and head to Miami.

579
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,264
You like Miami?

580
01:00:28,332 --> 01:00:30,926
I'm thinking of going to Monaco.

581
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:32,594
Oh, Monaco!

582
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:35,434
That's the place with that Kelly
girl from Philadelphia. She's queen.

583
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:39,670
Yeah, they have a casino there,
very elegant.

584
01:00:39,744 --> 01:00:42,110
No women dealers yet,
but I'm hoping.

585
01:00:42,179 --> 01:00:46,582
Only now I'm learning about music
and I'm gonna start reading books.

586
01:00:46,651 --> 01:00:51,281
Developing some style. Learning new
languages because I want to travel.

587
01:00:51,355 --> 01:00:54,290
You thinking of leaving Atlantic City?

588
01:00:54,358 --> 01:00:56,792
Not for a couple of years.
I've got to develop my blackjack.

589
01:00:56,861 --> 01:01:00,160
I'm gonna deal my way to Europe,
to Monte Carlo.

590
01:01:01,265 --> 01:01:03,358
A regular Princess Grace!

591
01:01:13,844 --> 01:01:16,244
- Catch of the day?
- No fish!

592
01:01:16,314 --> 01:01:19,943
No clams, no mussels, no oysters,
no shrimp! I want meat!

593
01:01:20,017 --> 01:01:21,951
Lamb chops and pork chops
and liver.

594
01:01:22,019 --> 01:01:25,147
Bring us a menu.
And, waiter...

595
01:01:25,222 --> 01:01:26,814
More wine, the same.

596
01:01:28,392 --> 01:01:31,418
I don't want anything that swims.

597
01:01:31,495 --> 01:01:34,623
- Cigarette?
- Yeah. Oh, no. They're too strong.

598
01:01:34,699 --> 01:01:36,690
- Can I see that?
- Sure.

599
01:01:40,271 --> 01:01:42,762
It's nice to have money
to have things.

600
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:49,009
This belonged to Grace's husband,
Cookie Pinza, a personal friend.

601
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,844
Puligny-Montrachet 1966.

602
01:01:53,117 --> 01:01:54,982
Smell.

603
01:01:55,052 --> 01:01:57,816
Okay?

604
01:01:57,888 --> 01:01:59,446
I'll do it.

605
01:02:04,328 --> 01:02:06,159
Teach me stuff.

606
01:02:07,431 --> 01:02:09,831
Like what?

607
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,834
What you know.

608
01:02:11,902 --> 01:02:14,462
- You want information or wisdom?
- Both.

609
01:02:16,841 --> 01:02:18,638
I'll think about it.

610
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:23,078
The smartest man in the world was
on a quiz show winning everything.

611
01:02:23,147 --> 01:02:25,513
You know how they finally
tripped him up?

612
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:29,781
He knew everything under the sun
except his Social Security number.

613
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:31,822
He could have had the world.

614
01:02:31,889 --> 01:02:33,413
What's yours?

615
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:37,461
I don't have
a Social Security number.

616
01:02:37,528 --> 01:02:39,860
Everybody's got
a Social Security number.

617
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:42,023
You pay income tax?

618
01:02:44,035 --> 01:02:46,094
You still got your fingerprints?

619
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:50,800
- Well, sure.
- Let me see. Oh, my God!

620
01:02:50,875 --> 01:02:53,070
- You don't have any fingerprints!
- What are you talking about?

621
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,738
I got fingerprints.
I got lines...

622
01:03:04,789 --> 01:03:06,950
You wanna go back to Saskatchewan?

623
01:03:07,024 --> 01:03:08,821
I mean for the funeral.

624
01:03:08,893 --> 01:03:11,862
Look, I haven't been back there
for ten years.

625
01:03:11,929 --> 01:03:15,558
I'll stake you to a round-trip.
You can come right back.

626
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:17,066
Thank you.

627
01:03:18,436 --> 01:03:21,872
Then you should send a tribute.
Make a nice impression.

628
01:03:21,939 --> 01:03:24,806
Let me tell you, never let them
badmouth you at a funeral.

629
01:03:27,078 --> 01:03:30,639
Miss, I want these roses,
all of them.

630
01:03:30,715 --> 01:03:32,148
- All of them?
- Yes.

631
01:03:32,216 --> 01:03:36,175
Make a nice big wreath, hmm?
A card?

632
01:03:36,253 --> 01:03:38,915
- Just over there.
- Thank you.

633
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:40,854
How many are there?

634
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:43,587
Six dozen.
Would you like them sent?

635
01:03:43,661 --> 01:03:46,824
Yeah.
To Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.

636
01:03:46,897 --> 01:03:49,127
"Moose Jaw"?

637
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,794
It's near Medicine Hat.

638
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:00,340
"Business prevents my being with
you on this sad occasion. Sally."

639
01:04:00,411 --> 01:04:01,844
Okay?

640
01:04:02,646 --> 01:04:06,013
And miss, send flowers...
nice ones...

641
01:04:06,083 --> 01:04:09,143
"To Dave from Lou and the boys
in Atlantic City."

642
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:10,881
- You got that?
- Yes.

643
01:04:10,955 --> 01:04:12,547
Keep the change.

644
01:04:12,623 --> 01:04:15,091
- Thank you.
- Shall we go?

645
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:18,026
This is going to be the biggest
social event in Moose Jaw in years.

646
01:04:20,564 --> 01:04:23,465
I've got to go.

647
01:04:23,534 --> 01:04:25,900
- I hope I didn't...
- No, no, no.

648
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:29,030
I've got friends waiting.
I should have told you.

649
01:04:29,106 --> 01:04:33,440
We're fixing up this house
I'm moving to... a new place.

650
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,871
Can I see you later?

651
01:04:37,948 --> 01:04:40,416
I've got a class.

652
01:04:40,484 --> 01:04:42,418
Well, it was a nice lunch.

653
01:04:42,486 --> 01:04:44,351
Yeah. Thank you.

654
01:04:46,624 --> 01:04:49,252
- Thanks.
- See you.

655
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:08,336
Why did they have to kill him?

656
01:05:08,412 --> 01:05:10,346
Let's get away from here.

657
01:05:14,218 --> 01:05:17,949
- Dave was a nice boy.
- He was a shit!

658
01:05:18,022 --> 01:05:20,149
But you married him.

659
01:05:20,224 --> 01:05:23,250
Look, you would marry anybody too
to get out of Saskatchewan.

660
01:05:24,628 --> 01:05:26,493
Don't be mad at me.

661
01:05:31,669 --> 01:05:34,900
I'm sorry.
I'm not mad at you.

662
01:05:34,972 --> 01:05:37,736
It's just...

663
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,503
I'm late and everything.

664
01:05:39,577 --> 01:05:42,011
You want to go to your friends?
Come on, I'll take you.

665
01:05:47,518 --> 01:05:50,316
Okay, stop right here.
This is the place.

666
01:05:50,387 --> 01:05:52,753
See that kid on the roof?
He's in my class.

667
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:55,920
Come on in.

668
01:05:57,728 --> 01:05:59,696
- Hi, Sally.
- I know I'm late.

669
01:06:02,933 --> 01:06:05,458
Bernie?
I'm sorry I'm late, really.

670
01:06:05,536 --> 01:06:08,505
I know I'm over two hours late.
Forgive me, okay?

671
01:06:08,572 --> 01:06:12,440
Lou, Bernie. Bernie, Lou.

672
01:06:12,509 --> 01:06:15,535
Come see my room.
It's great.

673
01:06:18,282 --> 01:06:20,216
This Bernie...
you living with him?

674
01:06:20,284 --> 01:06:23,947
There's ten of us living here.
We're all dealers, would-be dealers.

675
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:28,219
- Bernie's baccarat.
- Fancy game with the shoe, huh?

676
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:30,920
- Very elegant, Bernie.
- I'm elegant too.

677
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,155
Oh, that's Agnes.
She's roulette.

678
01:06:44,909 --> 01:06:47,810
You learn never to split a ten.
A ten is dynamite with a two card...

679
01:06:47,878 --> 01:06:51,041
but after that
it can be your tragic flaw.

680
01:06:51,115 --> 01:06:53,606
But it's not just dealing the cards.

681
01:06:53,684 --> 01:06:58,178
You have to know how to surrender
and how to wash the deck...

682
01:06:58,255 --> 01:07:02,988
when to burn it, how to pluck chips,
share the box, stuff like that.

683
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,756
- When do you take your test?
- Three weeks.

684
01:07:05,829 --> 01:07:08,923
- I'll be making $20,000 a year.
- No kidding.

685
01:07:08,999 --> 01:07:11,433
Yeah. 30,000 with tips
if I'm really good.

686
01:07:11,502 --> 01:07:14,437
Hey. I'm gonna hang on to you.

687
01:07:15,539 --> 01:07:16,972
Be a gigolo.

688
01:07:19,043 --> 01:07:20,943
What about Grace?

689
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:24,672
She came down here during the war...
beauty contest.

690
01:07:24,748 --> 01:07:26,716
Oh, for Miss America?

691
01:07:26,784 --> 01:07:31,812
Nothing like that.
More like Miss Pinball Machine.

692
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:35,347
She came, she needed protection.
I protected her.

693
01:07:35,426 --> 01:07:37,587
She was this teenager.

694
01:07:37,661 --> 01:07:40,061
You protected her for forty years?

695
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:42,121
Well, she got married
along the way...

696
01:07:42,199 --> 01:07:44,793
Cookie Pinza.

697
01:07:44,868 --> 01:07:47,166
But I don't want
to talk about Grace.

698
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:55,942
Do you love her?

699
01:07:56,013 --> 01:07:57,913
I watch you.

700
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:02,809
The place where we live...
I watch you.

701
01:08:04,688 --> 01:08:07,213
- Through my window?
- You saw me?

702
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:11,553
I figured maybe
somebody was there.

703
01:08:11,628 --> 01:08:13,323
Did you know it was me?

704
01:08:13,397 --> 01:08:18,164
You were just this guy
across the way.

705
01:08:18,235 --> 01:08:20,066
Why do you use lemons?

706
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,834
The fish smell.
I'm embarrassed.

707
01:08:27,411 --> 01:08:30,778
I thought maybe it was for some
other reasons I didn't understand.

708
01:08:32,049 --> 01:08:36,315
I even went to a supermarket
to look at lemons.

709
01:08:38,088 --> 01:08:41,683
It's just to get the smell off.
It's nothing weird.

710
01:08:47,364 --> 01:08:50,629
What do you do
when you watch me?

711
01:08:50,701 --> 01:08:52,635
I look at you.

712
01:08:52,703 --> 01:08:57,197
You take off your blouse,
then you run the water.

713
01:08:57,274 --> 01:09:01,108
Then you take a bottle of gold
perfume and put it on the sink.

714
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:05,548
Then you slice the lemons.

715
01:09:05,616 --> 01:09:08,278
You open a box of blue soap.

716
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:12,550
You run your hands under the water
to feel the temperature.

717
01:09:14,391 --> 01:09:17,417
Then you take the soap
in your hands and...

718
01:10:47,718 --> 01:10:50,118
Are you Dave Matthews' wife?

719
01:10:50,187 --> 01:10:53,156
Look, are you a cop? I told you guys
I don't know anything about him.

720
01:10:53,223 --> 01:10:55,953
- Let's have a look in the bag.
- What are you talking about?

721
01:10:56,026 --> 01:10:59,223
- The lady said...
- Let go of him!

722
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,401
Hey, you. Relax, old man.

723
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,734
This is none of your business.
You don't want to get hurt.

724
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,460
Are you all right?

725
01:12:15,038 --> 01:12:17,700
Maybe you should go lie down.

726
01:12:20,777 --> 01:12:22,938
I don't wanna lie down.

727
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:28,910
I didn't protect you.

728
01:12:33,257 --> 01:12:37,216
Where the hell have you been?
Men were tearing the place apart.

729
01:12:37,294 --> 01:12:39,626
You go out,
you don't even tell me you're going.

730
01:12:41,665 --> 01:12:43,599
You okay?

731
01:12:44,801 --> 01:12:47,361
What the hell are you wearing?

732
01:12:48,372 --> 01:12:50,806
That girl buying your clothes now?

733
01:12:50,874 --> 01:12:54,776
Miss, I warn you.
Stay away from him.

734
01:12:55,879 --> 01:12:57,813
Oh, Christ.

735
01:12:57,881 --> 01:13:00,679
- Did he let that happen to you?
- I'm all right.

736
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,719
You shut up, Grace,
you goddamned old lady.

737
01:13:02,786 --> 01:13:06,449
If I'm an old lady,
what does that make you?

738
01:13:06,523 --> 01:13:09,117
I'm her lover!

739
01:13:09,192 --> 01:13:12,719
You wanna know his nickname
in the old days? "Numb Nuts."

740
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:20,494
Men had names like "Legs"
and "Bullets" and "Cookie."

741
01:13:20,570 --> 01:13:23,130
His was "Numb Nuts"!

742
01:13:25,842 --> 01:13:27,469
Lou, open this door.

743
01:13:27,544 --> 01:13:31,776
- I know you're hiding in there.
- Chrissie? Chrissie!

744
01:13:31,848 --> 01:13:35,579
- Oh, my God.
- You didn't protect her.

745
01:13:35,971 --> 01:13:37,779
What's your life worth?

746
01:13:37,854 --> 01:13:40,448
Cookie had more manood
in his toupe...

747
01:13:40,524 --> 01:13:43,015
than you've got in your fat frame.

748
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:46,395
Open this door!

749
01:13:58,775 --> 01:14:01,243
Chrissie, are you okay?

750
01:14:01,311 --> 01:14:03,404
Chrissie, look.
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

751
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:07,109
It's me. Chrissie. Okay, look.
It's gonna be okay.

752
01:14:09,152 --> 01:14:13,452
Lou, open the door, please.
I'm sorry.

753
01:14:13,523 --> 01:14:15,491
You're a wonderful man.

754
01:14:15,559 --> 01:14:19,256
Sometimes I forget to tell you
how much I love you.

755
01:14:23,133 --> 01:14:25,966
Chrissie, listen to me.
You're all right. You're okay.

756
01:14:26,036 --> 01:14:28,527
Just take it easy.
You're going to be fine.

757
01:14:28,605 --> 01:14:30,095
You're all right.
That's it. Come on.

758
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:33,665
- Oh, my God.
- Why didn't you call the police?

759
01:14:33,744 --> 01:14:37,180
My husband, Cookie Pinza,
said never call the police.

760
01:15:31,067 --> 01:15:33,934
Honey, it's not the first time,
let me tell you.

761
01:15:34,004 --> 01:15:36,837
When a bad element from New York
had my husband killed...

762
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:39,842
on the boardwalk,
Lou ran away.

763
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:43,778
He ran away then...

764
01:15:43,847 --> 01:15:45,781
so he runs away now.

765
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:50,082
What did they want?

766
01:15:52,456 --> 01:15:54,720
What are they looking for?

767
01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:58,124
- Why did you come here?
- To see you.

768
01:15:58,195 --> 01:16:01,255
- Don't give me that shit.
- She's a good girl!

769
01:16:01,331 --> 01:16:03,356
Why did you come here?

770
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:08,899
To sell some dope.
We needed money for the baby.

771
01:16:11,174 --> 01:16:14,871
There's nothing wrong with dope.
Dope belongs to the whole world.

772
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,714
Where did he get it?

773
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:22,274
Some people told us
about a drop in Philadelphia.

774
01:16:22,352 --> 01:16:24,650
Philadelphia's a nice place.

775
01:16:24,721 --> 01:16:27,155
What did he do with the money?

776
01:16:27,224 --> 01:16:29,419
I don't know where the money is.

777
01:16:29,493 --> 01:16:31,654
He went out with that old man.

778
01:16:33,563 --> 01:16:36,760
- Dave went out with Lou?
- They took my scale.

779
01:16:41,638 --> 01:16:43,629
Hey, I want to talk to...

780
01:17:12,702 --> 01:17:14,499
Hey, Pops, what...

781
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:18,371
This is the last batch.
Five G's. Take it or leave it.

782
01:17:20,444 --> 01:17:24,107
Pops, I'm a little tapped right now.
I can give you four G's...

783
01:17:24,181 --> 01:17:26,115
give you the rest later,
all right?

784
01:17:31,989 --> 01:17:33,320
I'll take it.

785
01:17:37,628 --> 01:17:39,619
Call Fred at the Club Harlem.

786
01:17:39,697 --> 01:17:42,131
Tell him you're dealing
with Lou Paschall... that's me.

787
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,168
Tell him to tell those hoods
to leave the women alone.

788
01:17:45,236 --> 01:17:47,397
What they're looking for,
I got.

789
01:17:55,947 --> 01:17:59,178
Lou, I'm gettin' compliments
on the suit, Lou.

790
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,480
You look sharp, Buddy,
real sharp.

791
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:23,233
In three weeks,
you'll become dealers...

792
01:18:24,642 --> 01:18:26,872
and you'll learn a painful truth.

793
01:18:26,944 --> 01:18:29,003
Everybody hates you.

794
01:18:30,715 --> 01:18:32,706
You stand in the way
of a million dollars...

795
01:18:32,783 --> 01:18:35,274
the player hates you.

796
01:18:35,353 --> 01:18:39,016
You know enough to cheat
the casino... the casino hates you.

797
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:43,959
The TV camera over your head
tapes your every move...

798
01:18:44,028 --> 01:18:46,724
and yet you are alone.

799
01:18:46,797 --> 01:18:49,664
The players, the floor manager...

800
01:18:49,734 --> 01:18:53,067
the eye in the sky...
they all watch you.

801
01:18:56,307 --> 01:18:57,968
You're alone.

802
01:19:01,312 --> 01:19:03,644
Mr. Shapiro wants to see you.

803
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:07,777
Mrs. Matthews, how you doin'?

804
01:19:08,919 --> 01:19:11,080
Come on in.

805
01:19:11,155 --> 01:19:13,282
Come on.

806
01:19:13,357 --> 01:19:15,257
How are ya?

807
01:19:15,326 --> 01:19:17,851
Sit here. Go on.

808
01:19:19,730 --> 01:19:22,597
Your husband had a record.

809
01:19:22,667 --> 01:19:24,862
I hadrt seen or spoken to him
in eight months.

810
01:19:24,935 --> 01:19:28,928
I know that, and I understand that,
and this is very unfair, but he...

811
01:19:29,006 --> 01:19:31,236
I don't even know why he was here.

812
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:34,277
I know that, and you know that,
but they don't know that.

813
01:19:34,345 --> 01:19:36,142
- "They"?
- The SEC...

814
01:19:36,213 --> 01:19:39,080
the Gambling Commission,
the tax people... they don't know it.

815
01:19:41,118 --> 01:19:46,021
We just can't afford to have people
with your connections working here.

816
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:48,923
I'm gonna tell you something.
I feel you have misled us, Sally.

817
01:19:48,993 --> 01:19:50,927
Sally, right?

818
01:19:50,995 --> 01:19:54,260
Mr. Shapiro, please. I've only got
three weeks of class left, I need...

819
01:19:54,331 --> 01:19:58,461
Look, I am entirely on your side
in this situation...

820
01:19:58,536 --> 01:20:01,471
but this is a very important job...

821
01:20:01,539 --> 01:20:04,531
and I feel that I just have
to let you go.

822
01:20:05,609 --> 01:20:07,167
I'm sorry.

823
01:20:08,713 --> 01:20:11,273
Would it have made any difference
if we hadn't been married?

824
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,316
Marriage is not the point here.

825
01:20:13,384 --> 01:20:17,218
We have to be very careful
of our people and who they know.

826
01:20:17,288 --> 01:20:22,487
If this guy loved you, he would have
shown up sooner or later. You know?

827
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,790
So love is the point here.

828
01:20:25,629 --> 01:20:27,460
Yeah.

829
01:20:32,703 --> 01:20:34,534
- They fired me.
- What?

830
01:20:34,605 --> 01:20:37,403
Six weeks of classes down the tubes,
just like that.

831
01:20:38,509 --> 01:20:42,206
- Can you loan me fifty bucks?
- I don't have it.

832
01:20:42,279 --> 01:20:44,042
I thought we were friends.

833
01:20:44,115 --> 01:20:48,882
Listen, I saw your sugar daddy
down there at the tables.

834
01:20:51,122 --> 01:20:54,182
- Really?
- Borrow from friends with bucks.

835
01:21:01,699 --> 01:21:02,961
Twenty.

836
01:21:04,969 --> 01:21:06,402
Push.

837
01:21:12,009 --> 01:21:16,742
Can we talk to you?
I really think we should talk.

838
01:21:16,814 --> 01:21:19,408
Sir, please don't bother
the players.

839
01:21:24,455 --> 01:21:27,618
You're selling something
I believe belongs to us.

840
01:21:27,691 --> 01:21:30,819
I'd like return of the item and
the money you received for the item.

841
01:21:30,895 --> 01:21:33,056
Hey, man, there's
a game going on here.

842
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:37,157
And I'd like to know
how the connections were made.

843
01:21:37,234 --> 01:21:41,261
Kid got my name in Vegas.
Harry Gropke sent him to me.

844
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:44,205
When you come to Atlantic City,
I'm the man to see.

845
01:21:44,275 --> 01:21:47,904
Come on. We know who you are.
You're nothing, mister.

846
01:21:47,978 --> 01:21:50,310
Hey, there's a game
going on here.

847
01:21:50,381 --> 01:21:53,282
Sir, you can't disturb the players.

848
01:21:53,350 --> 01:21:55,284
I think we should continue this
outside.

849
01:21:55,352 --> 01:21:57,445
- No.
- Let's go.

850
01:22:07,898 --> 01:22:10,059
You're playing with Dave's money.
I'm owed it.

851
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:12,568
Madam, please. If you're not playing
you'll have to leave the table.

852
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:15,400
- Sit down and be quiet.
- You're buying me roses.

853
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:18,498
I'm fired from my job, I'm supposed
to sit here like some Vegas bimbo.

854
01:22:18,576 --> 01:22:20,601
Mister, I got hoods
beating the shit out of me.

855
01:22:20,678 --> 01:22:23,579
If I'm beat up for money and drugs,
I want the money and drugs on me.

856
01:22:25,549 --> 01:22:27,414
Don't touch the suit.

857
01:22:27,484 --> 01:22:31,045
- You're like Dave gone senile.
- Madam, you'll have to go.

858
01:22:31,121 --> 01:22:35,148
- Look, I trusted you.
- I'll take care of her.

859
01:22:35,226 --> 01:22:37,820
Look, he took my money.
Make him give me back my money!

860
01:22:37,895 --> 01:22:40,125
But I want my money!

861
01:22:40,197 --> 01:22:42,131
You see that man over there?

862
01:22:42,199 --> 01:22:44,292
- Where?
- In the blue suit?

863
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:48,828
- So?
- He only wants a blonde next to him.

864
01:22:48,906 --> 01:22:50,498
What do you mean?

865
01:22:50,574 --> 01:22:52,940
No, strictly for luck.
Nothing will happen.

866
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:55,945
If he loses, he'll be
too depressed to do anything.

867
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,948
If he wins,
he'll just talk about it.

868
01:23:03,621 --> 01:23:05,054
- You pimp!
- What?

869
01:23:05,122 --> 01:23:07,113
- What do you think I am?
- I was trying to help you!

870
01:23:07,191 --> 01:23:09,887
Help me? You're trying to whore me.
Get your hands off me.

871
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:12,394
- You'll have to leave the casino.
- Leave me alone!

872
01:23:12,463 --> 01:23:14,829
If you're gonna arrest somebody,
arrest that guy down there.

873
01:23:14,899 --> 01:23:17,197
He's the one pushing drugs.
Leave me alone!

874
01:23:17,268 --> 01:23:19,293
Somebody get my money back.
That guy took my money.

875
01:23:19,370 --> 01:23:23,363
Let go of me!
Get me my money back!

876
01:23:23,440 --> 01:23:25,374
This woman is not allowed
in the casino.

877
01:23:25,442 --> 01:23:27,569
I don't want to be in the casino.
I want my money.

878
01:23:27,645 --> 01:23:30,079
You let these punks in here,
you won't let me in here?

879
01:23:30,147 --> 01:23:33,708
This guy beat me up.
He wrecked my house. Let go of me!

880
01:23:33,784 --> 01:23:35,809
- Come on!
- I'm very, very sorry, sir.

881
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:38,013
This woman has just been fired.
She's very upset.

882
01:23:38,088 --> 01:23:41,319
On behalf of the hotel,
I'd like to give you reservations...

883
01:23:41,392 --> 01:23:45,590
for the Camelot Room,
also the Superstar Room.

884
01:23:46,497 --> 01:23:49,591
Get your hands off of me!
Let go of me!

885
01:23:49,667 --> 01:23:51,862
Let go!
I can walk out by myself.

886
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,895
Get your hands off of me!
Will you get your hands...

887
01:23:55,973 --> 01:23:59,204
Let go of me!
Let go!

888
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:05,211
Let go! Are you happy?
Okay? I'm out!

889
01:24:07,985 --> 01:24:09,418
Shit!

890
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:18,484
Hey, stop! Wait!

891
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:24,393
Where did he just go?

892
01:24:25,903 --> 01:24:27,336
Thank you.

893
01:24:53,330 --> 01:24:55,321
I need your help.

894
01:24:55,399 --> 01:24:58,891
My father, he's escaped.

895
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:03,303
He's on your bus. He's the old guy
with the white hat and trench coat.

896
01:25:03,374 --> 01:25:06,935
- He's not right in the head.
- What do you want me to do?

897
01:25:07,011 --> 01:25:10,538
Could you please get him off
the bus? He needs his medication.

898
01:25:10,614 --> 01:25:13,014
- Yeah. Leave it to me.
- Thank you.

899
01:25:16,153 --> 01:25:19,919
We made a little mistake.
We've oversold the bus.

900
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:22,959
So one of you is gonna have
to get off.

901
01:25:24,428 --> 01:25:26,692
You were the last person
to buy a ticket, sir.

902
01:25:26,764 --> 01:25:29,733
- Come on, old man. Come on, sir.
- What?

903
01:25:29,800 --> 01:25:32,928
We've oversold the bus, sir.
I'm afraid you have to get off.

904
01:25:33,003 --> 01:25:35,233
You got plenty of seats.

905
01:25:35,305 --> 01:25:38,138
Yeah, but they're reserved.
I'm sorry. Come on, sir.

906
01:25:38,208 --> 01:25:39,641
Jeez, I mean...

907
01:25:39,710 --> 01:25:41,974
- We got a schedule, sir.
- Is there another bus?

908
01:25:42,046 --> 01:25:45,140
There's another bus coming
right behind, sir.

909
01:25:45,215 --> 01:25:49,709
Can't hold up all these people.
That's it. Come on, sir.

910
01:25:49,787 --> 01:25:52,381
- Your daughter will care for you.
- I got no daughter.

911
01:25:52,456 --> 01:25:55,755
- Let's not be naughty.
- Come on, Pops.

912
01:25:55,826 --> 01:25:57,987
This woman is not my daughter.

913
01:25:58,062 --> 01:26:02,089
I talked to Jimmy and the kids.
You can have your own room and TV.

914
01:26:02,166 --> 01:26:06,227
And Jimmy won't play his stereo loud
if you won't smoke in the closet.

915
01:26:07,538 --> 01:26:09,563
I made love to this woman today.

916
01:26:09,640 --> 01:26:11,164
Daddy, please!

917
01:26:11,241 --> 01:26:14,267
I held her in my arms,
and I made her happy.

918
01:26:14,344 --> 01:26:16,278
- Let's not be naughty.
- It's gonna be okay.

919
01:26:16,346 --> 01:26:19,076
It's gonna be all right.
We'll take good care of him.

920
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:22,710
I'm dangerous!
People come to me from Las Vegas.

921
01:26:22,786 --> 01:26:25,584
I know Bugsy Siegel.
I was his cellmate.

922
01:26:26,657 --> 01:26:29,251
I want that money.
It belongs to me.

923
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:34,694
You have money. I've seen it.
Don't give me that shit.

924
01:26:34,765 --> 01:26:38,132
- Listen, I don't have it.
- Give it to me.

925
01:26:47,978 --> 01:26:49,912
Hey, old man.

926
01:26:55,285 --> 01:26:57,276
Hey, foxy grandpa.

927
01:26:57,354 --> 01:27:01,848
It's over now. I want the money.
You know what I'm talking about.

928
01:27:01,925 --> 01:27:03,688
Give me the money.

929
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,218
Give me the money now.

930
01:27:07,297 --> 01:27:08,821
You bitch!

931
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:12,596
You slapped me! You slapped me,
you stupid bitch!

932
01:27:12,669 --> 01:27:15,229
The money. Money, money!

933
01:27:40,998 --> 01:27:43,159
Come on, get outta here.

934
01:27:44,902 --> 01:27:47,097
Get in the car!

935
01:28:15,999 --> 01:28:17,933
I can't believe I did it.

936
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:20,026
Am I bleeding?
Did he cut me?

937
01:28:20,103 --> 01:28:25,268
I can't believe I did it. I really
did it! Did you see me do it?

938
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:26,934
I'm all right.

939
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:30,411
When I saw that knife on you,
I pulled the trigger. Bam, bam!

940
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:33,608
- Did you see the look on his face?
- Get rid of that gun.

941
01:28:33,684 --> 01:28:38,417
- I protected you.
- Stop pointing... Get rid of it.

942
01:28:48,265 --> 01:28:51,632
- How much?
- A quarter. Can't you read?

943
01:28:51,702 --> 01:28:55,832
Lady, it's the first time I've been
out of Atlantic City in twenty years.

944
01:28:57,741 --> 01:28:59,732
A thousand dollar bill?

945
01:28:59,810 --> 01:29:01,437
I'm sorry.

946
01:29:02,813 --> 01:29:05,043
- Here.
- Here's a hundred.

947
01:29:06,116 --> 01:29:08,050
I'll lend you the quarter.

948
01:29:08,118 --> 01:29:09,915
Thank you, madam.

949
01:29:22,766 --> 01:29:24,893
A room for me and my mother.

950
01:29:24,968 --> 01:29:28,096
And we want some drinks.
Bourbon, Coke.

951
01:29:29,373 --> 01:29:33,969
No, wait. Make that champagne,
peanuts, crackers.

952
01:29:34,044 --> 01:29:36,239
The expensive kind.
The French kind.

953
01:29:37,314 --> 01:29:38,747

I don't believe in gravity.

Sure! Everything comes back.

01:32:39,230 --> 01:32:41,790
You know,
you look after people good.

1004
01:32:44,669 --> 01:32:47,797
I never had to look after anybody.

1005

The meanest, the coldest.

1009
01:33:26,878 --> 01:33:30,405
- And he was your cellmate?
- I gotta be honest.

1010
01:33:30,481 --> 01:33:32,676
- I was in the slammer on a D&D.
- What's that?

1011
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:34,718
D&D. Drunk and disorderly.

1012
01:33:34,785 --> 01:33:38,186
They brought Bugsy in for ten
minutes on the way to Leavenwon'th.

1013
01:33:38,256 --> 01:33:40,918
Man, was he pissed off.

1014
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,983
He didn't even know me.

1015
01:33:44,095 --> 01:33:46,063
And that's all?

1016
01:33:49,467 --> 01:33:52,197
I never killed anybody in my life.

1017
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:56,333
