00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,653
- A little bit softer now
- Shout

2
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,449
- A little bit softer now
- Shout

3
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:52,025
- Hi.
- Hi, girls.

4
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,403
How are you?

5
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,790
- A little bit softer now
- Shout

6
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,792
- A little bit softer now
- Shout

7
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,502
- A little bit softer now
- Shout

8
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,836
- A little bit softer now
- Shout

9
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,005
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

10
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,843
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

11
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,637
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

12
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:12,430
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

13
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,182
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

14
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,809
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

15
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,686
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

16
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,437
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

17
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:21,022
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

18
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,607
- A little bit louder now
- Shout

19
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,442
Hey-eh-eh-eh

20
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,111
- What?
- Eddie.

21
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,738
- Eddie, have you seen Boogie?
- He's over there.

22
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,480
Thanks.

23
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,451
Hey

24
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,703
Boogs.

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,038
Boogie. Come here.

26
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:40,291
Jump up and shout now
Everybody shout now

27
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,794
I was just downstairs in the basement.

28
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,588
Fenwick is breaking windows
with his bare hands.

29
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,299
He's punching out the windows
with his bare hands.

30
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,719
And he'll break every one in the place.

31
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,929
I'll go talk to him.

32
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:56,307
Oh, shout now
Hey, shout now

33
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:59,644
Everybody shout now
Jump up and shout now

34
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,553
Get down and shout

35
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,602
What's up, Fen?

36
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,158
Just breaking windows, Boog.

37
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:16,870
We're gonna take a short break
and then we'll be right back.

38
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,153
What for?

39
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,031
It's a smile.

40
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:25,920
Come on, don't be a schmuck.

41
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,340
I know glass is made from sand.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,385
How come you can see through it?

43
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,929
Leave the windows alone.
What's the matter with you?

44
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:39,059
- It's a smile, that's all.
- Yeah, I'm cracking up.

45
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:44,763
Fenwick, you break another window,
and I'm gonna give you a fat lip.

46
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,933
Now, where's your date?

47
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,727
Gave her away.

48
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,865
- What?
- I gave her away.

49
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,784
David Frazer said she was death.

50
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,613
So I said, "If you like the way
she looks, take her."

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,165
What are you, the Salvation Army?

52
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,825
I charged him 5 bucks.

53
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,496
Come on upstairs.

54
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:12,541
Come on.

55
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,514
You really are nuts.

56
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,350
What about her? She didn't have to go.
I'm nuts. Get that.

57
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,894
That's what you get
for going out with 11th-graders.

58
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:25,772
- Her brains aren't developed yet.
- Yeah, but her tits were.

59
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,024
- Falsies.
- Were they?

60
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,734
Firsthand info.

61
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,278
Shit. Then what am I pissed about?

62
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,705
Hey, Eddie. It looks like
you're having a lot of fun.

63
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,915
Perk up.

64
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:48,285
- How could you take Frazer over the Fen?
- Because.

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:52,465
Diane, did you know
that Frazer paid 5 bucks for you?

66
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,541
That's the kind of guy he is.

67
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,460
He did?

68
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:02,049
Do you want to leave with...?
You wanna leave with Frazer?

69
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,395
Not really. Fenwick scares me.

70
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:06,887
He's all right.

71
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,857
Why don't you take me home?

72
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:11,985
I go to law school now.
I have to go home and study.

73
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:17,157
The only reason I came by here
is because I appreciate the fine music.

74
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:21,911
- I thought you worked in a beauty parlor.
- Yeah, I do, during the day.

75
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,114
Would you do me a favor?
Would you go home with the Fen?

76
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,459
Okay?

77
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,410
Okay?

78
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:44,392
- Are you cold?
- No.

79
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,852
I could turn the heat on.

80
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,109
Elyse feels that Eddie is getting
very sensitive about the wedding.

81
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:55,560
Yeah, I know. We were talking about it.

82
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,241
You know what word
I'm not comfortable with?

83
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,996
"Nuance." It's not a real word.
Like "gesture." "Gesture" is a good word.

84
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,457
At least you know where you stand
with "gesture."

85
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:13,203
But, "nuance," I don't know.
Maybe I'm wrong.

86
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,966
- Aren't you chilly?
- No, no, I feel good. I feel good.

87
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,968
- Am I going too fast for you?
- No. No.

88
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,517
Look at that Fenwick go.

89
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,371
You know, Elyse's mother
is very upset with Eddie.

90
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,374
They picked out this yellow and white
motif for the wedding.

91
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,627
You know, like we did.
Napkins, tablecloths, bridesmaids...

92
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,714
maid of honor, the whole bit.
Anyway, Eddie objected.

93
00:05:56,814 --> 00:06:00,093
He wanted blue and white,
the Colts' colors.

94
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:02,011
He refused to give in.

95
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:03,888
So?

96
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:06,381
Well, you know how stubborn Eddie is.

97
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,310
Could have been worse.

98
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,512
Could have been black and gold,
Steelers' colors.

99
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,859
Billy's coming in on
a train this morning.

100
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,487
I thought he was just
coming in for the wedding.

101
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:22,240
We didn't want to mention it.
It's a surprise for Eddie.

102
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,359
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know.

103
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,250
Stay here.

104
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,007
Oh, Jesus.

105
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:58,934
You son of a bitch.

106
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,406
I really got you guys, didn't I?

107
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,285
I've been carrying this ketchup bottle
around for weeks.

108
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,707
- You asshole.
- Weeks.

109
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,377
I hid behind the car. I didn't want
to get any ketchup on my dress.

110
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,848
Weeks. Just waiting for the right time.

111
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:24,177
Well, you got me. Christ,
I really thought you'd bought it.

112
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:28,505
Real hard, holding back the laughs.
Real hard.

113
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:32,852
- You really outdid yourself, Fenwick.
- That's very mature, Fenwick.

114
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,520
Fuck mature.

115
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,022
Hey. Hey.

116
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,732
Sorry, Beth.

117
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,984
Did you overturn this yourself?

118
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:42,894
Yeah, yeah. Give me a hand.

119
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,605
No way.

120
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,577
Hey, come on, guys.

121
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,331
Yo, Boog? Modell, come on.

122
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,375
Hey, guys, come on.

123
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,585
Hey.

124
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,130
Fenwick, you turned this over by yourself.
You've got to turn it back.

125
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,800
But it was easy getting it over,
because of the angle.

126
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,677
- It's gonna be a bitch getting...
- Come on. Did you try it?

127
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,336
I'll bet you didn't even try.

128
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:11,881
I'm buying at the diner.

129
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,353
You know, Fenwick, you're a schmuck.

130
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,305
Another five seconds,
you would've had it for free.

131
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,313
Hey, I'll see you guys later
at the diner, okay?

132
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,244
You're a sick person, you know that?

133
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,413
You're not a normal person.

134
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,197
You guys really are sick, you know that?

135
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,292
That's because you got no sense
of humor.

136
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,460
Yeah, right.

137
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,349
You can't compare Mathis to Sinatra.
There's no way, no way.

138
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,986
They're in totally different leagues.

139
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:07,363
Eddie, they're both great singers.

140
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,741
You know the thing about Sinatra?
He's good, but he's too thin.

141
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,160
I don't like that.

142
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,873
Yeah, but you can't compare them.
Sinatra is the Lord. All right?

143
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:19,625
He's big in movies.
He's big in nightclubs.

144
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,545
Let me ask you another question:

145
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:26,331
When you wanna make out, who do you
make out to? Sinatra or Mathis?

146
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,636
- That's a stupid question.
- One question, answer that.

147
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:33,890
It's irrelevant.
I won't answer it. Mathis.

148
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,132
There you go. How about you, Shrevie?

149
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,387
- I'm married. We don't make out.
- That's funny.

150
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,316
- Hey, George, do you got a Band-Aid?
- No.

151
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,443
- Come on, you have a Band-Aid.
- I don't.

152
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:47,153
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

153
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,405
- You don't know?
- I cut myself shaving.

154
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:53,034
Sorry about that Diane thing.
I didn't know you had a thing for her.

155
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,619
Yeah, yeah, it's okay.

156
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,704
Well, what about my 5 bucks?

157
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,248
- Give me a couple of days.
- A couple days?

158
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,084
Can I have French fries and gravy,
with a cherry Coke?

159
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,253
Sinatra doesn't like
fatty foods, I think.

160
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,372
Look who's here.

161
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:08,799
Hey, how'd it go?

162
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,302
Pretty good. Said she never wanted
to see me again.

163
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,429
You're a charming person, you know that?

164
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,557
- What happened?
- I parked the car on a nice, lonely road.

165
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,643
I looked at her,
I said, "Fuck or fight?"

166
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:21,979
Hey, that's a good line.
I'll use that myself sometime.

167
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,649
- You're a maniac.
- You always know exactly what to say.

168
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,068
- I love this.
- Well, how old is she?

169
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,819
- She's jailbait.
- What is she, 12?

170
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,196
- She'll be 12.
- Jailbait.

171
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,657
- "She'll be 12."
- She's old enough to know better.

172
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,035
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
She said she wanted to see me again.

173
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,620
She liked me, sort of.

174
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,580
- Get out of here.
- Come on.

175
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,491
George, will you come here
and talk to him? He's driving me wild.

176
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,583
What is that? Roast beef?

177
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,804
Don't ask me this anymore, Modell. Yes.

178
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,389
You gonna finish that?

179
00:10:56,489 --> 00:11:00,685
Yeah, I'm gonna finish it. I paid for it.
I'm not gonna give it to you.

180
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,979
If you're not gonna
finish it, I'd eat it.

181
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:06,566
- What do you want? Say the words.
- Go ahead. You eat it. That's all right.

182
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,569
Say, "I want the roast beef sandwich."
I'll give you a piece.

183
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,364
- Would you guys cut this out? Every time...
- He doesn't talk. He just...

184
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,075
- You know what he means, right?
- I know what he means.

185
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,286
If he'd say the words,
I'd give him a piece.

186
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,288
If I wanted it, wouldn't I ask you?

187
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,707
- Then ask. You know he wants it.
- Just let it go.

188
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,667
- He wants it.
- You're annoying as hell.

189
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,086
I'm annoying?
I'm trying to eat a meal by myself.

190
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,256
If you want to give him the sandwich,
give him the sandwich. If...

191
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,342
- I don't want to...
- Then eat the sandwich, and shut up.

192
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,344
- Look at his eyes.
- I asked one question.

193
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,847
Know what your problem is?
You don't chew your food.

194
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,349
That's why you get so irritable.
You get lumps.

195
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,144
You have roast beef in your heart
that just stays there.

196
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:47,481
Oh, Modell, you're really, really
getting me mad. My blood is boiling.

197
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:49,191
- I'll take the sandwich.
- Don't...

198
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,361
- Fine. I'll take the sandwich.
- See what you do. Every time!

199
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,114
Why are you blaming me?
He took your sandwich.

200
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,824
- You want this?
- No.

201
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,534
- You want this?
- I don't want it.

202
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,995
- I do.
- I can't believe you're eating the...

203
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,581
You two play against me.
That's what the problem is.

204
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,323
You're both on each other's side.

205
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,795
Come on, George. Lend me another 10.

206
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,923
What do you want from me?
You owe me $10 already. Get out of here.

207
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,092
- Boog, come here.
- Don't be like that.

208
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,970
- Wait a minute, Bagel.
- Come here a second, Boog. Come on.

209
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,297
Get out of here.
I don't want to talk to you.

210
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,678
- What, Bagel?
- Did you lay down a bet with Barnett?

211
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,524
- I don't remember.
- Yeah, right.

212
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:34,153
Nobody bets $2000 and forgets, Boogie.

213
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,363
So, what's the point?

214
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,699
Well, the point is, Boog,
where are you gonna get the $2000?

215
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,441
You haven't got a pot to piss in.

216
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,537
Look, the game is a lock.

217
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,208
Nothing's a lock, Boog.
Nothing's a lock.

218
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,918
Look, you want me to call it off?

219
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,587
Out of respect for your father,
may he rest in peace.

220
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,913
Look, leave my father out of it.

221
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:58,543
Listen, Bagel, just you should get in.

222
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:00,753
I've gotta go.

223
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,131
See you around.

224
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,851
- Kids, man.
- Very crazy.

225
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:08,729
Nobody's interested in making
an honest buck anymore.

226
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:10,439
I heard he's going to law school.

227
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,192
Well, that's what I'm talking about.
You call that an honest buck?

228
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:31,877
Bagel heard about my basketball bet.

229
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,454
And I'm already down for 10 bucks.

230
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,092
- Big spender.
- Come on.

231
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:42,263
Hey, listen, Eddie.
If you guys want in on this...

232
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,974
I'm gonna tell you now
they're shaving points in this game.

233
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,810
- You heard they're shaving points?
- How do you know?

234
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,562
I know. This is no bullshit tip.

235
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,565
I heard about your tips before.
Cost me 50 bucks.

236
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,483
- How do you know?
- No way.

237
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,153
- What's your resource?
- Don't get in.

238
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,072
Will you listen to me?
They are shaving points on this game.

239
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,282
You want in or not?

240
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,034
They're definitely shaving points?
You feel secure?

241
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,985
- Forget it.
- Who's the guy?

242
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,791
- Why do you ask so many questions?
- Because I don't know who the guy is.

243
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,461
Let me make it 15. Because...
Make it $15.

244
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,837
Let me ask you a question.

245
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,089
If you're really sure, make it 20 bucks.

246
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,259
Don't do it, Modell. I'm telling you.
I lost 50 bucks last game.

247
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,053
All right. Will you guys hop off
of the subject?

248
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:25,389
- Can you quiet?
- Fifteen bucks would be good.

249
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:28,434
Modell. Who do you pick,
Sinatra or Mathis?

250
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:32,271
- Would you just let that die? Please.
- It's important to me.

251
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,523
- It's annoying me.
- It's important in my life.

252
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:37,777
You've been asking that question
to every man that walks in here.

253
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,278
Would you just forget it?

254
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,822
Maybe I have something to gain
from the answer.

255
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,366
- Did you ever think of that?
- What does it matter?

256
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,777
Let the man speak.
Let the man speak. Speak.

257
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,414
Presley.

258
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,707
Elvis Presley?

259
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,918
There you go.
There's the definitive answer.

260
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:57,922
- Sinatra or Mathis? It's Presley. Fine.
- You're sick. You're sick.

261
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,382
You feel better?
Did you learn something?

262
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:04,502
You've gone like two steps below
in my book.

263
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,715
Once again...

264
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,009
I guess you're full?

265
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,315
I'd sacrifice anything
Come what might

266
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,151
For the sake of havin' you near

267
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:23,364
In spite of a warnin' voice
That comes in the night

268
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,698
And repeats

269
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:29,870
Did I tell you guys that I've got a date
with Carol Heathrow tomorrow night?

270
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,081
You're taking out Carol Heathrow?

271
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,999
No, you're taking her out.

272
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,743
She is death.

273
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,548
I only go for the best.

274
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,842
Heathrow is cold.

275
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,209
She's not a smart girl.
You ever talk to her?

276
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,431
You wanna bet that she goes
for my pecker on our first date?

277
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,934
The only hand on your pecker
is gonna be your own.

278
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,855
Do you want to bet me?
Do you want to bet me 20?

279
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,346
You got it.

280
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,067
- I'm in.
- Me too.

281
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,530
Yeah, I'm in too,
but we need validation for this.

282
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,314
All right. I'll arrange it.

283
00:16:06,423 --> 00:16:09,910
How? What, are you gonna
get fingerprints?

284
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,871
I'm telling you,
I'm not gonna do the dusting.

285
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,593
- You bring your car?
- No, I walked. Yeah, I brought my car.

286
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:27,344
You're going straight home?

287
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:31,015
No, I'm going by way of Atlantic City.
What kind of question is that?

288
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,684
Because if...
I'll wait for the other guys.

289
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,979
You constantly do this. You walk out
behind me. You stand there...

290
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,065
- Maybe you got plans.
- I have no plans. It's 4 in the morning.

291
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,443
- You want a ride?
- I'll go with you if you want.

292
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:45,446
- You want me to go with you?
- Say the words, "I want a ride."

293
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,697
I don't have to go.

294
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:49,116
I enjoy your company.
Do you want a ride?

295
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,409
- I'll go with you.
- Okay.

296
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:52,953
You got gas money? Just kidding.

297
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:56,072
You're so serious lately, Modell.

298
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,309
- Hey.
- Hey.

299
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,312
You're too much. How'd you know
I was coming in this morning?

300
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,022
We know, man. We know everything.

301
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,732
You up for some diner?

302
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,234
Hold on a sec.
I'm getting some coffee here.

303
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:27,404
You're gonna get coffee before
we go to the diner to have coffee?

304
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:29,147
I want coffee. Coffee.

305
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:32,191
I can't believe
that Eddie is getting married.

306
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:36,622
It's crazy. I mean, with Shrevie here,
it was nuts. But with Eddie, it's lunacy.

307
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,999
Hey, marriage is all right.
I'm not complaining.

308
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,377
Not complaining, huh?
That sounds wonderful.

309
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,421
Of course it's not a hundred-percent
sure thing yet. Right?

310
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,883
- He's getting married New Year's Eve.
- No, no.

311
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,344
Not until she takes the test.

312
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,304
- What are you talking about?
- Tell him.

313
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:56,850
Eddie's giving Elyse a football quiz.
If she fails, the marriage is off.

314
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,937
Football quiz? Come on, you guys.
Are you putting me on?

315
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:01,438
Is this a joke or what?

316
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:05,025
No. You know Eddie and the Colts.
It's very serious stuff.

317
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,737
The test has got something like,
what, 140, questions.

318
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:11,240
True and false, multiple choice,
short answer.

319
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,243
It's an oral test.
He doesn't want any cheating.

320
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,037
So wait a second.
What happens if she fails?

321
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,998
- He's gonna call it off?
- Yeah.

322
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:23,159
He swears to it. The test was supposed
to be two months ago.

323
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,755
But Elyse keeps putting it off.
She's got a lot of pressure on her.

324
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,465
- I guess.
- Yeah.

325
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,051
It's not the best way
to start off a marriage.

326
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,960
Eddie's crazy.

327
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:54,074
Billy, you're missing
all the action now.

328
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,284
Yeah?

329
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,370
Yeah. Half the guys are
going to U of B night school.

330
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,622
I mean, it's a lot of
fucking laughs now.

331
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,709
- A master's in business. That's the lowest.
- Yeah.

332
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,587
What are you majoring in now,
Fenwick? Still?

333
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:14,970
- So who's at U of B?
- Well, Eddie's going, of course, and...

334
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:17,931
- And then there's me.
- Yeah?

335
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,641
- You going to law school?
- Yeah.

336
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,019
Yeah, I thought I would give it a pop.

337
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,772
I'm still working at the beauty salon
in the daytime.

338
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:29,443
- But you were so good at the beauty salon.
- Cut and fuck, 2.50.

339
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,944
All right, you guys laugh.

340
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,239
- You ever think of doing your own hair?
- You guys laugh.

341
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,575
- It looks good.
- Let me tell you something.

342
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,996
I get more action in a week
than you've had in your whole life.

343
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:43,572
No, I get it every night.

344
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,261
- Billy. You're in town already.
- Hi.

345
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,098
Yeah, I thought I'd come
and spend the holiday here.

346
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,892
I heard there are a lot of good parties
and stuff.

347
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,144
- You know your parents are out of town?
- No.

348
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,897
They're in Florida.
They'll be back for Eddie's wedding.

349
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,148
Is he still sleeping?

350
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:13,269
What else? It's only 2:30. Wake him.
I can't wait till he's out of the house.

351
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:32,890
Hey.

352
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,375
Hey. How you doing, Bill?

353
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,295
- What are you doing?
- Don't fuck with me.

354
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,716
Still the early riser, huh?

355
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,135
Yeah. Nothing changes.

356
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:51,390
- Yeah, except you're getting married.
- Yeah. Ain't that a kick?

357
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,950
Thought you weren't coming
until New Year's Eve?

358
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,370
Well, nothing happening
around campus, so...

359
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,081
Hey, did you bring that girl with you?

360
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,416
No. We broke up.

361
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:10,460
That's a shame. You know...

362
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,495
that picture you sent me?

363
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,049
It looked like she had
a great set of knockers.

364
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,217
Yeah.

365
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:22,222
- Didn't figure on you and Elyse so soon.
- Yeah, well...

366
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,515
Whoop.

367
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,810
Figured New Year's Eve would be good.

368
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,262
Get married.
Party through the night, you know?

369
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,567
I was pissed off.
I figured you'd at least call me...

370
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,185
and let me know you were planning it.

371
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,488
Yeah, well, you know.

372
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,107
But you're my best man, right?

373
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,026
Right?

374
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,207
What do you think?
Of course I'm your best man.

375
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,578
So Boogie and the guys picked me up
at the train station.

376
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,038
Yeah?

377
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,417
They didn't say anything to me.

378
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:02,294
Surprise, I guess.

379
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,296
I guess.

380
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,060
- How'd they know?
- Barbara Kohler told Fenwick.

381
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,063
Oh, yeah? You keep in touch, huh?

382
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,805
Oh, yeah.

383
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,069
Still nailing her, aren't you,
son of a bitch?

384
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,686
Never did.

385
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,991
You're kidding? What else would you be
doing with her all these years?

386
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,275
Talking.

387
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:29,280
- Talking? Am I losing my hair?
- You've still got a little up there.

388
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,334
If you want to talk, you always got
the guys at the diner.

389
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,628
You don't need a girl
if you want to talk.

390
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,787
Eddie, you'll never change.

391
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,792
Yeah, I saw it. It was in the papers
this morning, Marion. Yes, this morning.

392
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,723
- Hey, you and I gonna shoot some pool?
- I haven't shot pool in ages.

393
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:49,101
It's about time,
otherwise you lose your edge.

394
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,104
- You still have the morning paper?
- Mom, what's for breakfast?

395
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,939
The kitchen is closed.

396
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,691
I'm hungry here.

397
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:58,151
Wait a second.
You want something to eat? Make it.

398
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,279
I don't have all day to wait on you.

399
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:03,991
Come on, Ma. Don't give me that shit.
A fried baloney sandwich would be good.

400
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:06,451
Get out of the house.
Billy, take him out of here.

401
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,870
A fried baloney sandwich is not
a lot to ask for.

402
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,664
Hold the wire, Marion, will you?

403
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,418
Eddie, you're giving me a headache.
Take a walk.

404
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,995
What are you gonna do?
You gonna stab me?

405
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:21,258
Come on. Come on.

406
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,918
- Come on.
- You miserable creature.

407
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,179
How did you get to be such a thing?

408
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,515
- Take your best shot.
- Who do you think you are?

409
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,851
And then I'm gonna
punch your lights out.

410
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,394
You don't even look like me.

411
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,858
Where'd you come from? Get married
and get out of this house. Quick.

412
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:41,236
Come on, go for the gut.
Then you, you're going down and out.

413
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:43,822
Come on, I've got fists of granite.
Come on.

414
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:47,367
- How did you turn into such a thing?
- I won't look. Hit me right here.

415
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,786
And ruin my good knife on you?
It's not worth it.

416
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:52,863
Sit down. I'll fix you something to eat,
and that's it.

417
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,699
Eat a sandwich, then give me some peace.

418
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,086
- Billy, you want something?
- No, thanks.

419
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,080
- You sure? It's no trouble.
- No, really, I'm fine.

420
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,457
A lot's changed around here.

421
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,012
Oh, I'm never going to get married.

422
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,223
Never, never.

423
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,174
Aren't you, my Jo?

424
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,437
Is this show in color
or is something wrong with this set?

425
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:19,441
No, there's nothing wrong with the set.
This is a black-and-white set.

426
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,903
It... I don't think they're showing
the movie in color anyway.

427
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,364
I don't like color television.

428
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,898
Don't like color for nothing.

429
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:34,122
I saw Bonanza over at my in-laws,
and it was not for me.

430
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,865
The Ponderosa looked faked.

431
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,868
I hardly recognized Little Joe.

432
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,797
Well, maybe you had to tune it.

433
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:44,966
Not for me. Have you got an Emerson?
I hear they're real good.

434
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:48,845
Yeah. I've got an Emerson. I've got
an Emerson right here. It's a good set.

435
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,516
- What's all that stuff?
- This? You've got a high-fidelity system.

436
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:55,435
I don't want any high-fidelity system
with my television.

437
00:24:55,535 --> 00:25:01,191
All I want is a 21 -inch Emerson,
cabinet style.

438
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:06,905
Hey, Kenny, we got any Emerson,
21 inches, without the record player in it?

439
00:25:07,005 --> 00:25:10,700
- I'll check in the warehouse.
- He's gonna check that in the warehouse.

440
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,245
It'll take a few minutes.
Why don't you look around?

441
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:16,123
I'll look around
at some of the television sets.

442
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,615
You do that.

443
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,172
I talked to Boog.
He's taking Carol to the Strand tonight.

444
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,133
The Strand?

445
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,001
- He's gonna try it in the Strand?
- Yeah.

446
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,804
So, what do you want to do?

447
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,597
I'll be there. A few seats away.

448
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,476
Yeah, I'll be there too.
I got 20 bucks on this thing.

449
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,145
Don't want any judgment calls.

450
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:40,647
He's got a couple of C's
riding on this already.

451
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,649
- He's making bets left and right.
- What?

452
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:47,144
- He's got 200 bucks on this already?
- Yeah. A lot of people bet for Carol.

453
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,744
What have you been doing?
You been drinking already?

454
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:57,038
Yeah. I guess so.

455
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,748
What for? It's too early.

456
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:01,168
I don't know.
I'm getting antsy or something.

457
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,128
I can't figure out what. I don't know.

458
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,788
I'll see you at the Strand tonight.

459
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,292
Hey, Fen.

460
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,390
Are you sure you're all right?

461
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,175
Yeah. Hey.

462
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,234
Hey. What do you say, Knocko?

463
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,611
Hey, Billy.

464
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,280
- How are you doing?
- Eat, sleep, you know.

465
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,574
I never see you and the guys anymore.

466
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:35,118
You know how it is.
Time to move on, I guess.

467
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,329
You got change for a quarter?

468
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,415
- Doing okay, Billy?
- Yeah, I'm going for my master's.

469
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,032
Hey, wonderful.

470
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,660
Take seven. It's got a new felt.

471
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,006
What are you doing it for?

472
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:51,092
Well, It's not like I'm doing it
just to make her happy.

473
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,876
To hell with that.

474
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,213
No, you wouldn't want to make her happy.

475
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:00,050
Anyway, she's the only one
I really care about.

476
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:04,272
You know, it's not like I go looking
for girls to date, or anything like that.

477
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,725
You know, it seems
like the right time and all.

478
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,320
At least she's not a ballbreaker.

479
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:14,982
Christ. If she was a ballbreaker,
there'd be no way.

480
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:17,494
Right?

481
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,122
How you doing?

482
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,709
It's one thing to wear your dog collar,
but when it turns into a noose...

483
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,046
I'd rather have my freedom.
A man in jail is always for freedom.

484
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,550
Except, if you'll excuse me, J.J.,
I'm not in jail.

485
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,261
You're blind, Mr. McGoo.
This is the crossroad for me.

486
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,556
I won't get Kello. Not for a
lifetime pass to the polo grounds.

487
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,433
Not if you serve me Cleopatra
on a plate.

488
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,936
And that is why you put your hands
on my sister.

489
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,771
J.J., please. Susie tried to...

490
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,608
It's Methan's favorite movie,
Sweet Smell of Success.

491
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,101
- He memorized the whole movie?
- Yeah.

492
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:55,105
These younger guys, I tell you,
they're crazier than we were.

493
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,867
Eddie, are you taking
any of Boogie's action?

494
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,570
Yeah. No way he pulls this off.

495
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,827
There's a boy up there watching me.

496
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:28,680
There he goes. Funny feeling,
being looked at without knowing it.

497
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:33,862
Remember that family
that lived next door to us back home?

498
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,405
Yeah.

499
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:37,824
Their son used to look at me.

500
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,525
Without you knowing it?

501
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:44,331
Well, his bedroom
was right across from mine.

502
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:49,868
One night I felt naughty and went
right on undressing so he could see.

503
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:54,841
She says I bounce when I walk. Do I?

504
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,917
- Do I?
- What?

505
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,095
This thing even hurts.

506
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,807
And I couldn't blast my way into
this cast-iron girdle with dynamite.

507
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:05,769
I've had just about enough
rebellion for one afternoon.

508
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,272
- First you.
- Pants off.

509
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:12,391
- Why do you try to destroy it?
- I don't want her stared at.

510
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,862
So you insist on desexing her...

511
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,063
as though sex were synonymous with dirt.

512
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,580
This is the old rose garden.

513
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,917
It's sort of gone to seed.

514
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:47,801
The rose's thorn scratched you.

515
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,344
It's nothing.

516
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:53,483
Did you ever catch fireflies?

517
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,236
When I was young,
I used to put them in a bottle...

518
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,905
and see if I could get enough
to read by.

519
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:01,032
There used to be goldfish here.

520
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,327
- Did you ever catch any?
- No. I wasn't supposed to.

521
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:08,363
Then last winter, we forgot to take
them out and they all froze solid.

522
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:13,869
That poor cupid.
He looks lost without them.

523
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:17,497
He looks like he's waiting to be kissed.

524
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,417
He is.

525
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,587
How can you tell?

526
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,298
Well, I can't really.

527
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,259
I just know how he feels.

528
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,365
Shrevie, what's going on?

529
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:44,775
I have no idea.

530
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,913
- Would you hold on a second?
- You are disgusting.

531
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:53,543
Look, I know it was really terrible.
It was horrible, but it was an accident.

532
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,003
An accident?

533
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,673
No, Carol, seriously.
It was an accident. I swear to God.

534
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:02,918
An accident. Your thing just got
into a box of popcorn.

535
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,465
Well, damn near that.

536
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,687
- Listen, can I be straight with you?
- Boogie.

537
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:15,430
Wait, look. There's a real good reason.

538
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:19,810
You know, but it's like...
It's a little embarrassing to me.

539
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:23,855
I mean, so maybe if you don't want
to hear it, I'll understand.

540
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,316
Go on. I want to hear this.

541
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,402
Well...

542
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,737
I don't know, it's just...

543
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:36,169
I don't like to tell this to girls, but,
you know, you really are a knockout.

544
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:40,048
No, you really are. And sitting down
next to you in there got me crazy.

545
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,790
I got a hard on.

546
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,553
You know, I mean,
I don't like to admit it, but I did.

547
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:50,683
I mean, you don't know me. You know, I try
to come off like I'm being cool all the time.

548
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:55,230
I don't like to look like I'm hustling,
and there I was next to you with a boner.

549
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,273
You know, I don't...

550
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:58,974
Am I embarrassing you?

551
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:02,144
Go on.

552
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,740
I don't know, it's just that
the pain was killing me, you know?

553
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,452
It was to stop the pain.
It was digging into the side of my leg.

554
00:32:09,552 --> 00:32:13,321
So what I did was, you know,
I opened my fly to loosen everything up.

555
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,625
Just to give it a little air.

556
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,159
And, you know, it worked.

557
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,548
Everything settled down and then I got,
you know, caught back up in the picture.

558
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:25,051
And then, you know, when Sandra
got her leg caught on the bush...

559
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:28,388
and she lifted up her dress,
you know, it just popped right up.

560
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:31,057
And it went through the bottom
of the popcorn box.

561
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,394
And the force of it
just opened up the flap.

562
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,980
It just pushed the flap open?

563
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,233
It's Ripley's. I'm telling you,
it just pushed the flap right open.

564
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:44,102
And I couldn't move the box.
You know, you would have seen it.

565
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,773
That's true.

566
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:50,859
Come on.

567
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,362
Let's go back inside.

568
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,749
- Okay?
- Okay.

569
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,075
Come on.

570
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,627
All right.

571
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,915
We'll just get a seat in the back here.

572
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,628
Do you care if I kiss you right here
in front of God and everybody?

573
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,671
I can't wait either.

574
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,938
What's that guy's name? The actor?

575
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:20,639
Troy Donahue.

576
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,600
Troy. What kind of name is Troy?

577
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,560
He's gorgeous.

578
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:28,605
You ever hear of a guy
with the name of Troy?

579
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,117
Yeah. Troy Swartzman from Towanda.

580
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:35,038
This movie was written by the author
of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit.

581
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,373
I wonder where that Barbara girl
and Billy are.

582
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:39,292
I'd really like to see this again.

583
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,159
You can take Elyse.

584
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,203
Hi.

585
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:47,958
Fellas, don't forget to bring
some tens tonight.

586
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,043
Ten whats?

587
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,554
I don't know.

588
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:55,590
Death. I'd give up your life
if I could have her.

589
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,570
We're even.

590
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,415
Take it easy. Take it easy.

591
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,792
Is he okay?

592
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:24,462
- Damn. That's Willard Broxton.
- Is he hurt?

593
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,547
Long time coming, Bill?

594
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,218
I couldn't believe it. There he was.
I didn't want to hit him, but I had to.

595
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,012
Definitely. You had to.
I mean, Willard Broxton.

596
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:34,389
Who's Willard Broxton?

597
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:36,349
You should have said something.

598
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:39,394
- What am I gonna say?
- Hey, I got Willard! Boo.

599
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,940
- Shrevie, who is Willard Broxton?
- I always liked Willard Broxton.

600
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,275
- You liked him?
- I used to take his milk money.

601
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,528
That was outstanding.
I'll see you guys later.

602
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,655
- Are we gonna go eat?
- I'm not in the mood.

603
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,864
Going to the diner?

604
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,283
Later. Gonna go to the
TV station to see Barbara.

605
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,694
Shrevie, who is Willard Broxton?

606
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:02,709
Well, it was the 11th grade.
No, no, it was the 10th grade. That's right.

607
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:06,379
Billy was playing ball against
one of the high school fraternities.

608
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,371
I think they were ULP.

609
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:12,552
So Billy comes sliding into second base
to break up the double play...

610
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:16,338
and the second baseman thought
that Billy was trying to hurt him.

611
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:19,767
So he jumped on Billy.
So Billy punched the guy.

612
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:23,011
And then, the whole ULP team
jumped on Billy.

613
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,772
They beat the crap out of him.

614
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,400
He's been waiting
for them after all these years?

615
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,195
- Well, he swore he'd get them.
- That was forever ago, Shrevie.

616
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:35,867
So Broxton makes it eight. Or seven.
Seven? No, no. It's eight. That's right.

617
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,817
There's one guy left.

618
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,987
What are you waiting for? It's open.

619
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,172
What about the slides?
I didn't hear anything about the slides.

620
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:53,208
- There's not much time before the news.
- Yeah, I tried to call.

621
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,336
The switchboard closes down at 10.

622
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,017
I was getting the feeling
that you were trying to avoid me.

623
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:03,802
Oh, that's not true, Billy.

624
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,163
Do you want to run down
the film chains for me?

625
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,249
The governor's press conference on 3.
There's a B roll of it.

626
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,867
And the slides? One.

627
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:39,212
- Stand by for cold tease.
- Ten seconds.

628
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,967
- Who's the visitor?
- Friend of mine. Five seconds.

629
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,344
And, one. Mike, cue.

630
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,273
President Eisenhower returns
from the World Peace Tour.

631
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:53,861
Steel dispute continues. Interviews
with John Unitas and Coach Ewbank...

632
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,781
in preparation
for tomorrow's championship game.

633
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:58,950
These and other stories next.

634
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,119
Roll three, three and track.

635
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,539
Willy, after this I still have
a lot of work to do.

636
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,582
Why don't you call in the morning?

637
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,210
- Where's the news opening?
- Six.

638
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,754
Okay. What's good?

639
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:16,050
Church services are at 10, 8:30, 9.

640
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,303
Punch ID, and announce.

641
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:23,631
This is WBAL TV, Channel 11
in Baltimore, wishing all our viewers...

642
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:27,186
a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

643
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,059
Merry Christmas, baby

644
00:37:35,544 --> 00:37:39,064
You really did treat me nice

645
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,989
Bought me a hi-fi for Christmas

646
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:54,037
Now I'm living in paradise

647
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,958
Let's see. It's two more
days till the test.

648
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:04,599
And if she passes, it's two more days
till the thing. The marriage.

649
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,475
Where are you guys going, Puerto Rico?

650
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,727
No, Cuba.

651
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,772
Cuba, that's nice. My parents' friends,
the Copelands, they go there every year.

652
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,192
- They said it's nice?
- Really nice.

653
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,267
Yeah. Yeah, I heard.

654
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:23,066
Shrev, are you happy
with your marriage or what?

655
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,077
I don't know.

656
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,737
What do you mean, you don't know?

657
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,082
- You don't know?
- What?

658
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:33,586
How could you not...? You don't know?
How could you not know?

659
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,578
I don't know.

660
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:41,292
Beth is terrific and everything,
but Jesus, I don't know.

661
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,556
A big part of the problem
when you get married...

662
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:48,059
When you're dating...

663
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,645
everything is talking about sex, right?

664
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,523
Where can we do it?
You know, why can't we do it?

665
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:58,226
Are your parents gonna be out
so we can do it, you know?

666
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,489
Trying to get a weekend
just so that we can do it.

667
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:02,698
So you can do it.

668
00:39:02,798 --> 00:39:05,952
Everything is just always talking
about getting sex.

669
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:08,913
And then planning the wedding.

670
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,572
All the details.

671
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,708
Details, shit.

672
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:17,078
But then, when you get married...

673
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:21,550
It's crazy, I don't know. I mean,
you can get it whenever you want it.

674
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,803
You wake up in the morning,
and she's there.

675
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:27,005
And you come home from work,
and she's there.

676
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,185
And so all that sex-planning talk
is over with.

677
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,438
And so is the wedding-planning talk
because you're already married.

678
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,972
Right.

679
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:42,238
So, you know, I can come down here
and we can bullshit the whole night away.

680
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:46,534
But I cannot hold
a five-minute conversation with Beth.

681
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,537
It's not her fault. I'm not blaming her.
She's great. It's...

682
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,112
No, of course not.

683
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:54,782
It's just,
we've got nothing to talk about.

684
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,588
But, it's good, it's good.

685
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,289
It's good?

686
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,093
- It's nice, right?
- Yes.

687
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,544
- It's nice.
- Right.

688
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,296
Right.

689
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,967
Well, you've always got the diner.

690
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:17,347
Yeah. We've always got the diner.

691
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:22,685
- But don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried.

692
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,031
- Ahem.
- Don't back out on me.

693
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:27,649
I'm not gonna back out on you either.

694
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:32,445
Unless, of course, she fails the test.
It's out of my hands.

695
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,951
Run, run Rudolph
Santa's got to make it to town

696
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,706
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down

697
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,637
Run, run Rudolph
'Cause I'm reelin' like a merry-go-round

698
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:57,188
Hey, Boog. Did you hear? They won by 14.

699
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,524
God! They weren't supposed to roll up
that high of a score.

700
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,226
You gonna listen to me next time?

701
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:21,869
Santa make him hurry
Tell him he can take the freeway down

702
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:28,376
Run, run Rudolph
Reelin' like a merry-go-round

703
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:57,039
Come here. Your mother
let you loose like this?

704
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,375
Look at those pants.
I got charcoal pants here.

705
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:04,213
You want to get inside the diner?
Come here. Look at these. Charcoal gray.

706
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,132
Special sale, 12.50.

707
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:09,969
- Twelve-fifty? You offered him 7.
- For you, 11.98. These are better.

708
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,514
You think I'll tell him?
Don't tell anybody where you got these.

709
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:16,142
- How much money have you got?
- Four bucks.

710
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:19,395
Four bucks? I've got a good shirt
for you. Forget the pants.

711
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,732
- It's incredible.
- Unbelievable.

712
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,391
Where's he now?

713
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:29,113
He's already up to the Pimlico. Right?
Then he's got the Junction.

714
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:32,741
And the Avalon and the Garrison.
That's the George's Deluxe in the corner.

715
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,275
Oh, yeah.

716
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,995
You know what that is?

717
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:40,749
One, two. The whole left side of the menu.
What a triumph if he pulls it off.

718
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,920
You're talking about 15, 16 more
if you include the...

719
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:49,341
- The Maryland fried-chicken dinner.
- I think he's just talking club sandwiches.

720
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,344
Excuse me, Earl. Does that
include the fried-chicken dinner?

721
00:42:52,444 --> 00:42:54,805
- Yes.
- It does.

722
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,517
Twenty-two deluxe sandwiches
and the fried-chicken dinner.

723
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:02,062
It's not human. He's not a person.
He's like a building with feet.

724
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:04,273
You know what I mean? It's unbelievable.

725
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:06,400
- Not gonna pay you, no.
- It's not fair.

726
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,404
She was supposed to grab your pecker,
not reach into the popcorn and get it.

727
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,531
- Exactly.
- She grabbed my pecker.

728
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:16,243
Yeah, but Boog, the bet was touch
your pecker, not pecker in popcorn.

729
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,455
That's right. It was pecker-touching
without intention.

730
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:24,335
I'm not gonna pay you. No.
No, she was supposed to grab your pecker.

731
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,378
- Give me some money.
- I don't buy it.

732
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,757
Yeah. I want it on the up-and-up.
Me too. This one was default.

733
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,425
Let it ride. I'll tell you what.

734
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,845
I'll bet you I can ball Carol Heathrow
on our next date.

735
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,305
Now, you're nuts.

736
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:37,848
- No.
- Come on, Boog.

737
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:40,935
- You want to bet me 50 bucks a guy?
- Fifty?

738
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,637
- Yeah.
- It's like stealing money from you, Boog.

739
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,150
- Are you in?
- Yeah, I'm in. I'm in.

740
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:49,527
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

741
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,945
- Are you in?
- I'm in.

742
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,739
All right.

743
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,533
- Yeah.
- Are you in, Billy?

744
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:57,233
No, I'm not in.

745
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,995
I'll take all the action I can get.

746
00:44:01,023 --> 00:44:02,331
We need validation.

747
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:06,085
All right, you want validation?
Okay, you can be there to validate.

748
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:07,853
Sure.

749
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,390
- Earl is the king.
- The whole left side.

750
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,393
The Portland. I didn't think he
could eat any more than that.

751
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,104
Do you want to look at some desserts?
He's locking up.

752
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,689
Get them now or forget it.

753
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:30,475
- Can he do it?
- Yes. He's getting in the car.

754
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:32,987
Good breakfast, Earl.

755
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:38,033
- Try to keep that down, Earl.
- Standing ovation for the Earl. Standing O.

756
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,650
The car moves.

757
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:42,195
Don't get in the way.

758
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:44,947
That was beautiful. Grind them.

759
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,825
Peel some rubber now, Earl.

760
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,963
Let's meet here at 12
and go to the game in my car.

761
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:54,133
Let's make it quarter to.
I don't want to miss any pre-game crap.

762
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:57,303
Why don't we just go now?
That way we won't miss anything.

763
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,681
Shrevie. Wait a minute, we're talking
about the championship game.

764
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:03,726
For Christ's sake, let's get serious.
A quarter to.

765
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:04,935
- All right?
- Quarter to.

766
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,261
- All right. I'll see you later.
- So long.

767
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,107
You got a ride?

768
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,109
- You going straight home?
- Yeah. Get in.

769
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,154
- It's no problem?
- Modell. Don't give me that. Get in.

770
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,481
You want me to go? I'll go.
Whatever you want.

771
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,067
I got to meet that girl. She is death.

772
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:08,957
- Very nice.
- Man, I'm in love.

773
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,909
Miss! Whoa, miss!

774
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,912
Whoa, miss?

775
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,248
- Hey, miss.
- Watch the road.

776
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,590
Hold on a second.

777
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,064
I was admiring your horse.

778
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:43,900
Were you?

779
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,621
Do you ride Western as well?

780
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:51,365
I do, but I prefer English.
There's a finer sense of control.

781
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,420
What's your name?

782
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,580
Jane Chisholm. As in the Chisholm Trail.

783
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:05,129
What fucking Chisholm Trail?

784
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:10,009
Do you ever get the feeling there's
something going on we don't know about?

785
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:19,185
Do you get the feeling
that she gave me a fake name?

786
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,825
- Do you want to keep driving?
- No. Might as well call it a night.

787
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,916
Is there anything wrong, Barb?

788
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,419
No.

789
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,215
Yes. I think I'm pregnant.

790
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:45,688
Me?

791
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,150
Yes.

792
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,614
Our one night in New York last month.

793
00:48:56,475 --> 00:49:01,713
Six years of a platonic relationship,
and then that night.

794
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,081
And this happens.

795
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:09,128
- Maybe it's for the best.
- No.

796
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:12,757
I don't think so.

797
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,968
Do you want to marry me?

798
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,138
Yes.

799
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:24,769
Is that why you came back
a few days early? To ask?

800
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,856
Well, I thought after New York,
you know...

801
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,452
Seven weeks is a long time
when you miss someone.

802
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,737
New York was a mistake.

803
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:42,703
Well, maybe it wasn't as romantic as we'd
like it to be, but I think it will happen.

804
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:46,957
It isn't perfect yet, but...

805
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,088
I love you, Barb.

806
00:49:54,408 --> 00:50:00,179
You're confusing a friendship
with a woman and love.

807
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,640
It's not the same.

808
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,657
That's the opening whistle
and our game begins.

809
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,910
You're still playing
for a 30-point bonus question.

810
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:16,371
Here's another toss up in English.
Are you ready?

811
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:22,044
A spaceship is stranded on the planet
Mercury outside of the libration areas.

812
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:25,213
It is night, and pitch black outside.

813
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:29,343
For 10 points, how long must
the explorers wait until sunrise?

814
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,261
Sun doesn't rise on Mercury.

815
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:32,554
Bryn Mawr. Stebbins.

816
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,349
They won't get a sunrise
because Mercury has one side...

817
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,518
perpetually turned toward the Sun
and the other away from it.

818
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,022
That's right. They would have
to wait forever. That's the answer.

819
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,982
I have a 20-point bonus coming up.

820
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:49,279
Here's your toss-up. For 10 points:
What would a man probably have...

821
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,909
if he had a visible contusion near the
upper part of his zygomatic arch?

822
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,620
- A black eye.
- A sharp lump on his head.

823
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,237
- No.
- Black eye, you bozo.

824
00:50:58,555 --> 00:50:59,790
Bryn Mawr. Stebbins.

825
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:03,877
I think, let's see,
he would have a bump here.

826
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,463
You look like you've got a bump
on your head.

827
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,788
A black eye.

828
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:10,791
All right.
We were looking for a black eye.

829
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:14,179
But I must accept a bruised cheekbone.
All right.

830
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:21,677
Yeah, Ma. I know I owe $2000.
Guess what? I heard it before you.

831
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,929
What am I gonna do?

832
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,309
I'm choice. I'm gonna have
to find a way to pay it off.

833
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,228
Me? I've got $56 to my name.

834
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:34,491
Yeah, I know I'm in trouble.

835
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,661
Then they'll kill me.
What can I tell you?

836
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:42,833
Here's your toss-up. For 10 points:
What home-grown philosopher said:

837
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,377
- "The masks of men lead lives..."
- Thoreau!

838
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:47,004
- Cornell. Pearlman.
- Thoreau.

839
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,914
Right, for 10 points.
"Lead lives of quiet..."

840
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,018
That's right, for 10 points.

841
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:03,562
The statement inscribed
in the US Post Office:

842
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,398
"Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat,
nor gloom of night..."

843
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,316
Herodotus!

844
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,111
For 10 points, what classical author
wrote it?

845
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:13,687
- Herodotus.
- Right, for 10 points.

846
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:17,409
Hey, Cornell. Take a walk, you bozo.

847
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,454
The final half, with the score:
Bryn Mawr College, 104...

848
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,997
and Cornell University, 60.

849
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,416
I talked to Shrevie.
Shrevie's gonna lend me 200.

850
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:25,908
- You going over now?
- Yeah.

851
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:31,089
I might drop in on my brother, might be
able to get some bucks from the toast.

852
00:52:31,189 --> 00:52:32,831
Howard?

853
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,951
Really?

854
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,095
I appreciate that, Fen.

855
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,213
I know how you guys feel
about each other.

856
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:45,636
Listen. With the Heathrow bet
I'm gonna be close. I'll see you later.

857
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,416
Beth?

858
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,752
- What?
- Come here.

859
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,348
I'm doing a crossword puzzle.

860
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,923
Come here!

861
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:28,313
Playin' the fiddle and drinkin' gin

862
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,564
What?

863
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:31,900
Have you been playing my records?

864
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,443
Yeah. So?

865
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,071
So didn't I tell you the procedure?

866
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,991
Yeah, you told me all about it, Shrevie.
They have to be in alphabetical order.

867
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,109
And what else?

868
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:47,573
They have to be filed alphabetically
and according to year as well. Okay?

869
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,616
And what else?

870
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,663
- What else?
- I don't know.

871
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:58,176
You don't know?
Well, let me give you a hint, okay?

872
00:53:58,276 --> 00:54:03,223
I found my James Brown record filed
under the J's, instead of the B's.

873
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,725
I don't know who taught you
to alphabetize.

874
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:08,770
But to top it off,
he's in the rock 'n' roll section...

875
00:54:08,870 --> 00:54:11,898
instead of the R & B section.
How can you do that?

876
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:15,735
It's too complicated, Shrevie.
See, every time I pull out a record...

877
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,613
there's this whole procedure
I have to go through.

878
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:21,116
I just want to hear
the music, that's all.

879
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,536
Is it too complicated to just keep
my records in the category?

880
00:54:24,636 --> 00:54:27,122
Just put the rock 'n' roll
in with the rock 'n' roll.

881
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:30,750
Put the R & B in with the R & B.

882
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:34,370
You're not gonna put Charlie Parker
in with the rock 'n' roll, would you?

883
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:37,007
Would you?

884
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,626
I don't know. Who is Charlie Parker?

885
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,264
Jazz! Jazz!

886
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,602
He was the greatest jazz
saxophone player that ever lived!

887
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,812
What are you getting so crazy about?

888
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:54,149
It's just music.
It's not that big a deal.

889
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:58,644
It is. Don't you understand?
This is important to me.

890
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,898
Shrevie, why do you yell at me?

891
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:07,579
I never hear you yell
at any of your friends.

892
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,831
Look. Pick a record. Okay?

893
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:12,167
- What?
- Just pick any record.

894
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,336
Any record. Okay.

895
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,078
What's the hit side?

896
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:20,800
- "Good Golly Miss Molly."
- Okay.

897
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:24,679
- Now ask me what's on the flip side.
- Why?

898
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:28,266
Just ask me
what's on the flip side. Okay?

899
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,976
What is on the flip side?

900
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:35,055
"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey." 1958.
Specialty Records.

901
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:42,280
See, you don't ask me things like that.
You never ask me what's on the flip side.

902
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,450
No. Because I don't give a shit.

903
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:48,370
Who cares about what's on the flip side
of a record?

904
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,538
I do.

905
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,875
Every one of my records means something.

906
00:55:53,975 --> 00:55:57,286
The label. The producer.
The year it was made.

907
00:55:57,437 --> 00:56:00,757
Who was copying whose styles.
Who was expanding on that.

908
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,717
Don't you understand?

909
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,761
When I listen to my records...

910
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:07,806
they take me back to certain points
in my life. Okay?

911
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:11,467
Just don't touch my records. Ever.

912
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:14,729
The first time that I met you...

913
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,817
Modell's sister's high-school
graduation party. Right? 1955.

914
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:23,061
And "Ain't That A Shame" was playing
when I walked in the door.

915
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,646
- Hi, Boogie.
- How you doing?

916
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,116
- Is Shrevie here?
- No.

917
00:57:08,216 --> 00:57:11,652
He's not here? I called him
a little while ago, he said he'd be in.

918
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,124
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

919
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:18,992
- Did I come at a bad time?
- No, it's all right.

920
00:57:19,352 --> 00:57:22,589
What's the matter? Maybe I should go.
I'll come back later.

921
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:25,091
Should I leave? Should I?
What's the matter?

922
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,385
Boogie, does he ever yell at you?

923
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:31,088
What? What happened, baby?

924
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:36,227
We had a fight.

925
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:39,721
- Why did you have a fight?
- I don't know.

926
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:45,018
Do you want me to talk to him?

927
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:48,156
- Tell me why you had a fight.
- I don't know...

928
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,816
Come on, don't cry. Come on.

929
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:54,069
- Come on, baby.
- I did something wrong.

930
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:57,040
I ain't got a man

931
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,876
I ain't got a son

932
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:02,712
I ain't got a daughter

933
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,548
I ain't got no one

934
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:08,468
I'm a lonely girl

935
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:11,262
I ain't got a home

936
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:14,047
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

937
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:17,435
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

938
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,146
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

939
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:23,024
I ain't got a mother

940
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:25,819
I ain't got a father

941
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:28,979
I ain't got a sister

942
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,742
He's in trouble. Don't you know
about friendship, Howard?

943
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,411
Five hundred dollars?

944
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,289
Four hundred, 300.
Whatever you can afford.

945
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:40,417
Maybe this is a lesson for you.

946
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:43,702
If you worked,
you'd have some money to lend him.

947
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:48,049
Yeah, I know. I'm irresponsible.
I dropped out of college.

948
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,010
I won't work in the family business.
I'm a disgrace.

949
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,973
That's a good reason to keep me
out of your house, God knows.

950
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:56,307
You're a bad example.

951
00:58:56,407 --> 00:59:01,396
Far be it for me to disagree.
Give me some money, Howard.

952
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,013
Do you ever read a book?

953
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:07,527
- Read. Do you ever read?
- Never.

954
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:11,448
You should read Dale Carnegie's
How to Win Friends and Influence People.

955
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,315
Give me some money, Howard.

956
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,660
Where'd you get this attitude?

957
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,247
I borrowed it. I have to have it back
by midnight. Howard.

958
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:22,292
I should talk to Daddy
about stopping your trust fund.

959
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,159
It's killing your initiative.

960
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:29,132
Some big trust fund.
A hundred dollars a month till I'm 23.

961
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,677
Yeah, Granddad was a real Rockefeller.

962
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,544
Howard.

963
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,723
It's important.

964
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,757
I wouldn't come otherwise.

965
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:43,387
I don't like to see you, so you know
it's got to be very important.

966
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,398
Get off.

967
00:59:45,498 --> 00:59:48,975
I despise you, and yet I'm here.

968
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,061
Get off.

969
00:59:57,093 --> 01:00:01,206
It's funny. You know, when I was
a little kid I always wanted a brother...

970
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,959
and I told that to Mom once.
And she said, "You have a brother."

971
01:00:05,059 --> 01:00:09,830
And I said, "Oh, that's who the asshole
in the other bed is."

972
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,597
If I had my way,
I'd just date Elyse all my life.

973
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,756
- Hey, watch it, pal.
- Just date her.

974
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,601
I personally like dating.

975
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,938
- What are you doing it for?
- I've been dating Elyse for five years.

976
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,316
I have no choice. You know how girls are.
Security and all that.

977
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:32,477
They need that thing,
that marriage thing.

978
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,328
What am I watching?

979
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,081
The movie just started
and I don't know what's going on.

980
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,031
It's symbolic.

981
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,416
Who's that guy?

982
01:00:55,526 --> 01:00:58,170
That's Death walking on the beach.

983
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:05,010
I've been to Atlantic City a hundred times
and I never saw Death walk on the beach.

984
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,782
Kids.

985
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,691
Kids did this.

986
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:24,613
Oh, tell me, baby

987
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,668
What's the matter with you?

988
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,620
It's a sacrilege for Christ's sake.

989
01:01:42,198 --> 01:01:43,891
Hey, what is this?

990
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,143
- Come on.
- What's wrong?

991
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,477
It's an emergency.

992
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:48,313
- What's up?
- Fenwick's in the manger.

993
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:50,764
- What?
- He's in the manger and he won't leave.

994
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:53,308
- Manger?
- I've never seen him like this.

995
01:01:56,212 --> 01:02:00,106
Oh, little town of Bethlehem

996
01:02:10,101 --> 01:02:14,079
- This is crazy.
- I told you.

997
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:18,301
Three more wise men.
They've heard of the miracle.

998
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:22,138
- Let's go, Fen.
- You must have traveled far.

999
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:26,351
Come. Come rest your weary feet.

1000
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,102
Come on, Fen. Get out of there.

1001
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:30,512
Someone'll spot you.
The police are gonna be here.

1002
01:02:30,955 --> 01:02:33,265
Come on, Fen. Put your pants on.

1003
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:35,777
This.

1004
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:40,239
This is a big smile. Don't you think?

1005
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,533
Yeah. Yeah, come on.

1006
01:02:42,633 --> 01:02:43,868
Come on.

1007
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:46,403
- Let's go.
- No! No!

1008
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:48,539
- Here we go.
- Fen, no! Fen!

1009
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,908
- Eddie, get him.
- Get his arms.

1010
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,994
- Billy.
- Billy, grab him.

1011
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,457
- I got him.
- Keep him. Hold on.

1012
01:03:04,363 --> 01:03:06,808
- Back! Back!
- Fenwick, put the damn sheep down.

1013
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:09,060
- Put the sheep down.
- Stop screwing around.

1014
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:13,805
Put the sheep down. We'll pick up
the three wise men and get out of here.

1015
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,524
Police.

1016
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:28,737
Fortunately, my work is done.

1017
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:32,407
Nice, Fen. Very nice.

1018
01:03:32,975 --> 01:03:35,785
- What do we do now?
- Choice.

1019
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,205
Thanks, pal.

1020
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:47,598
I added some killer
questions to the test.

1021
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:49,925
Tomorrow night's the showdown.

1022
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,676
Is she studying hard?

1023
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,898
Better be. Otherwise,
she's off to Cuba alone.

1024
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,824
Wish I knew what to do about Barbara.

1025
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,734
You get married.
You take her back to school with you.

1026
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,537
You get a part-time job.

1027
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:13,990
And, you know, by the time you've got
your master's, kid's arrived, all's well.

1028
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:16,034
Yeah, what about her job?

1029
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,578
Her job?

1030
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,675
Her job...

1031
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:26,220
I give you an answer and you confuse it
by bringing her into the problem.

1032
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,088
Do you want to take a walk?

1033
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,842
Look, Ed. She's in this thing.

1034
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,970
There's two of us, you know?

1035
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,056
She loves her work and...

1036
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:41,068
she doesn't want to marry me.
That's the bottom line.

1037
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,981
You're dealing with an irrational girl.
That's your problem.

1038
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:50,953
Look, do you want to find someplace else
to stand, buddy?

1039
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:54,197
You gonna do some thing about it?

1040
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:57,418
You heard him! Schmuck, back off!

1041
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,161
You gonna do something about it?

1042
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:09,347
Do you want to fight?
Is that what you want? Come on.

1043
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,756
Come on, you son of a bitch.

1044
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:15,427
I'll hit you so hard,
I'll kill your whole family.

1045
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:31,202
What's going on?

1046
01:05:31,302 --> 01:05:32,944
What?

1047
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,498
I've got him right here.

1048
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:40,044
We called Timmy's father, but he said
he wouldn't post bail until the morning.

1049
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,579
He wants to teach him a lesson.

1050
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:45,633
We get back from Florida, open the door,
and the police call.

1051
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,552
That's what I call good timing.

1052
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,054
- How's Mom?
- She's fine.

1053
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:59,188
- He was punching out wise men?
- Yeah, he was punching out the wise men.

1054
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,232
He was so drunk I couldn't believe it.

1055
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:04,902
I can't believe that his father
leaves him in jail overnight.

1056
01:06:05,002 --> 01:06:08,072
He's punching out the wise men
and knocks over the whole manger?

1057
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:12,535
His family situation is not the best.
Between his father and his brother...

1058
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:15,737
But why furnish your enemies
with ammunition?

1059
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:19,083
You're a family man, Harvey.
And someday, God willing...

1060
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:22,920
you may want to be president.
And there you are, out in the open...

1061
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,383
where any hep person knows that this guy
is toting this guy around with you.

1062
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,760
- Are we kids, or what?
- Get out of here.

1063
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:33,139
Thanks, J.J., for what I consider
sound advice.

1064
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,974
Would you get out of here?

1065
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:38,134
- Is he crazy, or am I mistaken?
- He's weird.

1066
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,723
Do you think I'm doing the right thing
getting married?

1067
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,518
Eddie, I can't tell you that.

1068
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:51,397
I keep thinking that I'm gonna
be missing out on things, you know?

1069
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,401
Yeah, well, that's what
marriage is all about.

1070
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:01,908
But I never did a lot before. You know?

1071
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:03,785
What?

1072
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:07,455
I never did a lot of...

1073
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,426
Not a lot of screwing around.

1074
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:14,295
Some, you know? Of course. A little.

1075
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:16,756
A little?

1076
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,300
A little.

1077
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,013
You son of a bitch.

1078
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:27,183
You're a virgin, aren't you?

1079
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,771
Technically.

1080
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,525
Ed...

1081
01:07:37,422 --> 01:07:39,154
You've got a lot to learn.

1082
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,962
Who am I gonna learn it from?

1083
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:49,455
Elyse? Elyse doesn't know anything.

1084
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:54,210
We could be in trouble.

1085
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,383
I am thinking of him.

1086
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:04,596
Barbara, this is stupid.
I mean, it's crazy.

1087
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:09,568
By deserting him before he dies.

1088
01:08:09,668 --> 01:08:12,363
I don't understand you, Barbara.
It's mine as well.

1089
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,782
I have something to say in this as well.
Don't I?

1090
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,692
I'm not talking about
doing anything drastic.

1091
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:19,704
An abortion, or anything like that.

1092
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:23,040
- I'm getting the feeling I'm not included.
- Keep your voice down.

1093
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:26,711
Who is it you think you're talking to?
I'm half responsible for this mess.

1094
01:08:26,811 --> 01:08:29,204
Please, don't talk so loud.

1095
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:33,509
I do not think this is the time or place
to talk about this very private matter.

1096
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,511
- When is the time?
- You're yelling...

1097
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:38,379
Why don't we take a 10-minute break?

1098
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:49,724
Barbara, what are we gonna do?

1099
01:08:50,292 --> 01:08:53,019
We've got to talk about this.
We've got to try...

1100
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:57,440
Would it be easier
just to let time pass?

1101
01:08:59,051 --> 01:09:01,620
He's very, very ill.

1102
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:07,367
I can't believe this happened to me.
I'm hardly the adventurous type.

1103
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:12,798
Somehow it just doesn't seem fair,
and that makes it very difficult.

1104
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:16,761
Of course it's difficult. Whether it's fair
or not doesn't make difference.

1105
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,755
- It's happened. Got to work it out together.
- I know.

1106
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:28,064
I know. I have a great
feeling for you, Willy.

1107
01:09:28,164 --> 01:09:30,473
You're my closest friend.

1108
01:09:31,083 --> 01:09:32,902
Barbara, I want you to marry me.

1109
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:36,072
Is it necessary to talk to him?

1110
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:40,108
I will not marry you.
Not out of convenience.

1111
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:43,996
Not because it's the thing to do,
which is what everybody else does.

1112
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,749
Do you think that I'm asking you
to marry me because...

1113
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:49,450
it's what everybody else does?

1114
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:56,916
Someday I may change my hairstyle,
but not yet.

1115
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:01,546
- Okay. Whenever you're ready.
- All right.

1116
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:08,511
- The style you have looks really good on you.
- Thank you.

1117
01:10:10,998 --> 01:10:12,849
Watch your head.

1118
01:10:15,002 --> 01:10:16,821
Hi, Boog.

1119
01:10:16,921 --> 01:10:18,730
How you doing, Beth?

1120
01:10:19,965 --> 01:10:22,775
- Here's the Post.
- Thank you.

1121
01:10:23,677 --> 01:10:25,037
Is Mr. Andre here?

1122
01:10:25,137 --> 01:10:29,125
No. Mr. Andre, he stepped out
to get some coffee and donuts.

1123
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,918
He'll be back. What's up?

1124
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,879
We're all supposed to have our hair done
for the wedding.

1125
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:35,631
The bridesmaids, the whole group.

1126
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:39,176
And I'm in charge to make sure
that Mr. Andre can handle it...

1127
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:43,806
without any problems. Maybe get some
extra operators or something.

1128
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:47,226
Yeah, I don't know what he has...
Can you get this?

1129
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:49,510
I don't know what he has planned.

1130
01:10:49,620 --> 01:10:52,022
You're not gonna go to work that day,
are you?

1131
01:10:52,122 --> 01:10:55,484
No, but I'm sure he's got
something arranged.

1132
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,362
Why don't you, sit down over there
and he'll be right in.

1133
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:00,063
Okay.

1134
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,815
I'm gonna go out for a second.

1135
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:19,290
- It's cold out here. I should get my coat.
- Come on. It's not that cold.

1136
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,376
Where are we gonna go?

1137
01:11:21,652 --> 01:11:23,596
Let's go down here to my office.

1138
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,223
- This is your office?
- Yeah.

1139
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,936
Get in.

1140
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,272
- What's the matter?
- You had a payment to make.

1141
01:11:33,372 --> 01:11:34,481
I'm gonna make it.

1142
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:38,110
You were supposed to make it last night.
Nobody in the office got a call.

1143
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:41,906
That was a mistake. I forgot.
I've placed some bets tonight.

1144
01:11:42,006 --> 01:11:43,481
I'm gonna have it.

1145
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,951
- Don't bullshit me, Boogie.
- I'm not bullshitting.

1146
01:11:46,051 --> 01:11:47,745
- Don't bullshit me.
- Unh!

1147
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,830
Tank, cut it out. I'm gonna make it.

1148
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:54,826
Tank, what are you doing?

1149
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:59,256
Who do you think you're fucking with,
some kid?

1150
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,758
What are you doing?

1151
01:12:00,858 --> 01:12:03,093
Fun and games, a little kids' play
or something?

1152
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,720
- I'll have it.
- I'm not amused.

1153
01:12:04,820 --> 01:12:06,931
- I'm not amused. Hear me?
- Don't hit me.

1154
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:10,267
- Tank, what are you doing?
- No ifs, ands, or buts. All right?

1155
01:12:10,367 --> 01:12:12,718
- I'm gonna have it.
- Tonight.

1156
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,973
Tank, don't...

1157
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,489
Carol. Hey.

1158
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:07,773
I was just thinking about you.

1159
01:13:09,134 --> 01:13:10,568
What?

1160
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,122
The flu?

1161
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:17,825
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
That doesn't sound too good.

1162
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,453
Yeah.

1163
01:13:22,392 --> 01:13:23,873
A hundred and two?

1164
01:13:24,108 --> 01:13:26,885
Yeah, well listen. All right.

1165
01:13:26,985 --> 01:13:29,253
All right. Take care, and...

1166
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:31,515
All right.

1167
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:35,259
Listen, I'll call you back later
and check up on you.

1168
01:13:36,245 --> 01:13:38,596
Okay. Bye-bye.

1169
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,125
You feeling better?

1170
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:14,048
Yeah, well, I'm not crying.
I think that's about the only improvement.

1171
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:20,888
Boog, I want to thank you
for last night.

1172
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,476
I guess I just needed someone.

1173
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:31,732
Don't thank me. It was... I don't know.
It just kind of felt like old times, you know?

1174
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:37,029
Standing in the doorway, I kind of
felt like I was dating you again.

1175
01:14:39,391 --> 01:14:43,379
Boog, when we were dating,
did you care for me?

1176
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:44,912
Sure I did.

1177
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:48,717
No, I don't mean just because
you could do stuff to me, but...

1178
01:14:48,817 --> 01:14:50,928
But because you really cared.

1179
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:55,464
Of course, Beth. I mean, there was plenty
of girls around for a quick pop.

1180
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,477
If that's what I wanted.

1181
01:14:58,577 --> 01:15:02,847
But I got to tell you, you were good.

1182
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,859
I was?

1183
01:15:07,671 --> 01:15:09,637
Believe me.

1184
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:13,608
How would I rate?

1185
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:17,621
You would rate way up there.

1186
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:22,827
I mean, because,
I never told you this, but this,

1187
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:25,838
I often think of the nights
that we spent together.

1188
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:28,164
I mean, and that was a long time ago.

1189
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:34,920
You know, I don't have any sense
of myself anymore.

1190
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:38,424
I don't know what I am.

1191
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:45,014
- I don't know if I'm pretty or if I'm...
- Oh.

1192
01:15:45,832 --> 01:15:49,185
I just, I have no sense of me anymore.

1193
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:52,980
Listen.

1194
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,368
I don't know what Shrevie...
I don't know what he doesn't tell you.

1195
01:15:56,468 --> 01:15:58,662
But you don't have anything
to worry about.

1196
01:15:58,762 --> 01:16:01,498
You're a definite looker.
You're a very... Listen to me.

1197
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:05,993
You're a very sexy lady. You are.

1198
01:16:07,145 --> 01:16:09,121
I think...

1199
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,134
I think maybe we should...

1200
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:14,335
you know, go out sometime.

1201
01:16:16,446 --> 01:16:18,547
I think we should get together.

1202
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:24,313
Is, Shrevie gonna go over...

1203
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,523
for Elyse's football test?

1204
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,224
Yeah.

1205
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,102
Well?

1206
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:33,813
I don't know.

1207
01:16:34,339 --> 01:16:36,232
Are you going?

1208
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:39,360
No.

1209
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:44,990
What do you think?

1210
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,664
Maybe we can go out tonight, Boog?

1211
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,335
Yeah.

1212
01:16:59,156 --> 01:17:00,756
Yeah, we...

1213
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:04,593
We can get together.

1214
01:17:04,995 --> 01:17:06,595
Okay.

1215
01:17:09,374 --> 01:17:13,269
Was George Shaw
a first-round draft choice?

1216
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:15,030
Five, seven.

1217
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,648
First-round draft choice? True.

1218
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,067
Wrong. He was a bonus pick.

1219
01:17:20,218 --> 01:17:22,996
Elyse, did you study?

1220
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:27,584
Okay. That concludes the true-and-false
section of the test.

1221
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,128
Let me get the short-answer
stuff in order.

1222
01:17:30,228 --> 01:17:32,089
- Can I have a glass of water?
- No.

1223
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,914
How's she doing?

1224
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,804
Elyse has about a 72 so far.
But she's hitting a bad streak.

1225
01:17:38,904 --> 01:17:42,432
Before the Cleveland Browns joined
the NFL, they were in another league.

1226
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:43,924
What was it called?

1227
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:46,311
Browns were in another league?

1228
01:17:46,411 --> 01:17:48,313
- Yes, they were.
- I don't know.

1229
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:50,315
This is hot. You have anything cold?

1230
01:17:50,415 --> 01:17:53,068
Elyse, don't get too close
to the answer sheet. Okay?

1231
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:56,363
- What's it now, Shrev?
- Let me see.

1232
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,606
What, passing is 65?

1233
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,742
No. Passing is 65.

1234
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:05,789
Buddy Young played for a team
that no longer exists.

1235
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:08,657
What was the name of that team?

1236
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:14,715
- Anybody know that?
- Not a chance.

1237
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:19,303
- The New York Yankees football team.
- The New York Yankees football team?

1238
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:22,973
They also were part
of the All-American Football Conference.

1239
01:18:23,073 --> 01:18:25,216
I contributed that question.

1240
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:33,233
What was the longest run from scrimmage
by a rookie in his first game?

1241
01:18:33,333 --> 01:18:34,443
Alan Ameche.

1242
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:37,112
Hey! We heard that in here.

1243
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:39,865
I'm disqualifying this question.

1244
01:18:39,965 --> 01:18:42,909
I knew that. Seventy-nine
yard run, opening day 1955.

1245
01:18:43,009 --> 01:18:44,578
Good, Shrevie. You blew that.

1246
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:47,956
I'm sorry. I got excited. It's one
of the few questions that I knew.

1247
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:49,416
Sorry, Elyse.

1248
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,659
- How many more?
- I don't know. I lost count.

1249
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,339
Elyse's mother is on the phone.
How's she doing?

1250
01:18:55,439 --> 01:18:57,466
The guys think it could go either way.

1251
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,917
Either way. Okay.

1252
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:05,557
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- No. Okay. The Colts signed him.

1253
01:19:05,657 --> 01:19:08,226
A Heisman Trophy winner
who decided to play in Canada.

1254
01:19:08,326 --> 01:19:11,637
Now, however, he plays for the team.
What's his name?

1255
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:14,107
Heisman Trophy winner.

1256
01:19:14,207 --> 01:19:16,026
- L.G. Dupre.
- No. Billy Vessels.

1257
01:19:16,126 --> 01:19:18,570
- I should've known that.
- Should-ofs don't count.

1258
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,448
Vessels. Out of Oklahoma.

1259
01:19:21,548 --> 01:19:25,285
- She could have racked up points on that one.
- I have no idea what the score is.

1260
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:28,205
You want to bet she goes down
for the count?

1261
01:19:28,305 --> 01:19:32,199
Last question. The Colts had
a team here, lost the franchise...

1262
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:33,877
then got one from Dallas.

1263
01:19:33,977 --> 01:19:36,797
What were the colors
of the original Colt team?

1264
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,299
Ooh. Ball buster.

1265
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,718
- The original colors?
- My mother quizzed me on this.

1266
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:43,627
Also my question.

1267
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,141
- Green and gray.
- Right.

1268
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:50,894
Whoa. What a scrapper.

1269
01:19:50,994 --> 01:19:53,146
A tough question and she pulls it
out of the bag.

1270
01:19:53,246 --> 01:19:55,524
- Very impressive.
- Okay. Total's coming up.

1271
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:59,403
True and false, 72.

1272
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:02,239
Killer choices. Very confusing.

1273
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,607
Short answer, 64.

1274
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,860
- What do you think?
- I don't know. Pick them.

1275
01:20:08,512 --> 01:20:12,114
- Cliffhanger.
- The total is 63.

1276
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:14,000
Sixty-three.

1277
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,212
- I think you better check that again.
- Two points.

1278
01:20:17,312 --> 01:20:19,047
I checked the figures thoroughly.

1279
01:20:19,147 --> 01:20:21,633
- What do you think he'll do?
- He'll give them to her.

1280
01:20:21,733 --> 01:20:23,927
Good sportsmanship is worth two points.

1281
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:28,714
Eddie, what about the Alan
Ameche question? I knew that one.

1282
01:20:31,243 --> 01:20:33,552
The marriage is off.

1283
01:20:48,844 --> 01:20:50,527
Hi.

1284
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:55,751
- Where are we going?
- We'll go to Fenwick's apartment.

1285
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,661
Hey, listen. Put this on.

1286
01:21:00,939 --> 01:21:03,967
- What's that for?
- I don't know. In case somebody sees us.

1287
01:21:04,067 --> 01:21:07,753
They'll think you're Carol Heathrow
or somebody like that.

1288
01:21:09,698 --> 01:21:12,132
It's the craziest thing.

1289
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:19,431
How does it look?

1290
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,226
You look good.

1291
01:21:22,878 --> 01:21:25,104
Okay. Let's go.

1292
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:34,122
I gave him the questions. What's this jazz?
They were wonderful questions.

1293
01:21:34,222 --> 01:21:35,457
Go drive your truck.

1294
01:21:35,557 --> 01:21:38,409
Ask your son if they weren't
wonderful questions.

1295
01:21:38,810 --> 01:21:42,005
- I was just trying to have some fun.
- Don't raise your voice.

1296
01:21:42,105 --> 01:21:46,834
- I don't want you to raise your voice...
- How did I know it would end up like this?

1297
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:51,556
- Going to the diner. Want to go?
- I got to validate the Heathrow bet.

1298
01:21:51,656 --> 01:21:53,308
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

1299
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,676
Do you mind if I go with you?

1300
01:21:56,328 --> 01:21:59,346
Come on. I'm not gonna make any noise.

1301
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:02,683
- It's a small closet. You've got to be still.
- Okay.

1302
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:04,277
Okay, let's take my car.

1303
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:06,729
No. Let's take mine. Get some fresh air.

1304
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:10,816
Let's put the top up.
It's freezing out here.

1305
01:22:15,305 --> 01:22:17,781
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1306
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,827
- Let's go. Let's fly.
- Okay, Shrev. All right.

1307
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,248
Any forward gear will do here.

1308
01:22:28,526 --> 01:22:31,388
Beth would kill me if she knew
what I was doing.

1309
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:37,269
She goes with all the guys
From outta my class

1310
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:40,647
But that can't stop me
From a-thinkin' to myself

1311
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:44,600
She's sure fine-lookin' man
She's something else

1312
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:52,316
Hey, look a-there, across the street

1313
01:22:53,051 --> 01:22:57,122
There's a car made just for me
To own that car would be a luxury

1314
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,415
"My Prayer"?

1315
01:22:58,515 --> 01:23:02,043
Flip side, "Heaven on Earth," recorded
by The Platters for Mercury Records.

1316
01:23:02,143 --> 01:23:05,088
- Color of the label, maroon. Another.
- "I'm Stickin' With You"?

1317
01:23:05,188 --> 01:23:08,133
"I'm Stickin' With You."
Flip side is "Ever Lovin' Fingers."

1318
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:11,595
Recorded by Jimmy Bowen
for Roulette Records.

1319
01:23:11,695 --> 01:23:14,671
Color of the label is orange. All right.

1320
01:23:14,823 --> 01:23:16,099
- "Donna"?
- "Donna."

1321
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:18,852
- Flip side?
- I thought "Donna" was the flip side.

1322
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,312
It's "La Bamba."

1323
01:23:20,412 --> 01:23:22,939
Oh, la, la, la, la, la, la bamba

1324
01:23:23,039 --> 01:23:25,349
Ba, da, da, da, da, la bamba

1325
01:24:05,331 --> 01:24:08,684
- Come on, I'll crouch. You stand.
- Fine.

1326
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:14,282
- All right?
- That'll be good.

1327
01:24:14,382 --> 01:24:15,575
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1328
01:24:15,675 --> 01:24:17,160
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

1329
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,453
I'm okay.

1330
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:22,114
- Let's leave it open. I'm claustrophobic.
- Come on, Shrev.

1331
01:24:24,559 --> 01:24:28,162
- I should have taken my coat off too.
- Take it off. It's a closet.

1332
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:48,841
Oh, God.

1333
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,235
She's beautiful.

1334
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,820
All right, you're good? That's good?

1335
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:06,626
You're gonna have to be real quiet
when we get inside. No talking.

1336
01:25:06,726 --> 01:25:09,786
I think you're being
a little paranoid, Boog.

1337
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:13,707
The walls are very, very thin.
You promise?

1338
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,126
Okay.

1339
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:22,090
Did you leave the door open?

1340
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,852
What door?

1341
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:26,146
Don't worry.

1342
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,856
What's going on? Come on, man.

1343
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:30,057
They should be here by now.

1344
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:34,394
- Boog, what are you talking about?
- Bet or no bet, it's not right.

1345
01:25:35,338 --> 01:25:39,066
Boog? Boog, what are you talking about?

1346
01:25:39,717 --> 01:25:41,318
Where are they?

1347
01:25:42,053 --> 01:25:43,621
They're taking their time.

1348
01:25:43,721 --> 01:25:45,248
I wonder what's happening.

1349
01:25:45,348 --> 01:25:48,408
- Come on, Boog.
- I think we're missing the show.

1350
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:59,544
So I was supposed to be Carol Heathrow?

1351
01:26:00,738 --> 01:26:02,923
That's right.

1352
01:26:03,533 --> 01:26:05,894
It was a sick thing to do.

1353
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,427
I'm sorry.

1354
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,280
Thanks, Boog.

1355
01:26:27,599 --> 01:26:29,116
What for?

1356
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:34,371
You had enough respect for me
to call it off. That says a lot.

1357
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:38,959
Look. I think you and Shrevie
should try to work out your thing.

1358
01:26:39,277 --> 01:26:41,753
Yeah. I just wish I knew what to do.

1359
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:46,300
Yeah, I don't know. It's like...

1360
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:53,108
This kind of problem with a girl,
I'm not too good about talking about it.

1361
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:57,987
But, I mean, you know me. If I
have a problem with a girl, I just split.

1362
01:26:58,087 --> 01:27:01,857
But I think you and Shrevie
should work your thing out.

1363
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,152
I think it would be worth it.

1364
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:12,159
Boog, when I came into the beauty parlor
this morning, and you said all those things...

1365
01:27:12,644 --> 01:27:14,286
were you lying?

1366
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,292
You'll always rate right up there.

1367
01:27:25,615 --> 01:27:28,300
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

1368
01:27:36,251 --> 01:27:38,852
What are you going to do
about the money?

1369
01:27:39,754 --> 01:27:41,480
I don't know.

1370
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:46,109
Come on, Boog. Don't let us down, buddy.

1371
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:48,445
Come on.

1372
01:27:49,097 --> 01:27:52,824
We're missing all the action.
I'll bet he's getting her in hallway.

1373
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:59,257
Can we have a couple more beers
over here?

1374
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:01,467
Do you remember copping a feel?

1375
01:28:01,767 --> 01:28:05,545
How could I forget?
Boogie was the first. Seventh grade.

1376
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:07,724
So...

1377
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:10,226
When I took out Ruth Ray,
I figured I had to do it.

1378
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:12,520
- Ruth Ray, eighth grade.
- Right.

1379
01:28:12,620 --> 01:28:17,317
Sat on the... Sat on the couch
in her club cellar for hours...

1380
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,236
trying to figure out
a way to get my arm around her.

1381
01:28:20,336 --> 01:28:22,906
Finally, I learned the move.

1382
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,564
Do you know the move?

1383
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:27,327
I yawned and put my arm
around her shoulder.

1384
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:30,580
Then... Man, was I young.

1385
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:34,751
Then came the big task
of getting my hand down to her breast.

1386
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,837
By the time, you know,
I got the nerve to move down...

1387
01:28:37,937 --> 01:28:40,048
I realized my arm was asleep.

1388
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:41,341
- No?
- Yeah.

1389
01:28:41,441 --> 01:28:45,428
There wasn't time enough to take it away,
get the feeling again, and start over.

1390
01:28:45,528 --> 01:28:48,181
I had to be in by 11.
Time was running out.

1391
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:52,852
The breast was moved toward,
with my arm asleep.

1392
01:28:53,457 --> 01:28:55,887
My first copping a feel was like this.

1393
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,901
That doesn't even count.

1394
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:02,528
Then I see the guys. You were there.

1395
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:05,114
They say, "Did you cop a feel?"

1396
01:29:05,214 --> 01:29:09,244
I said, "Yeah." The guys said,
"How was it?" I said, "Great."

1397
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:12,455
Do you mean to tell me that
you never copped a feel from Ruth Ray?

1398
01:29:12,555 --> 01:29:14,823
- No.
- You lied to me?

1399
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:17,451
- I ought to kill you.
- You believed me.

1400
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:20,171
I was dumb.

1401
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,293
And you believed me, you dick.

1402
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:33,758
Yeah, the whole thing
with girls is painful.

1403
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:38,388
And it seems like it keeps getting
more painful instead of easier.

1404
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:45,353
Hey, Boog's here.

1405
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:55,197
Hey, Boog.

1406
01:29:55,681 --> 01:29:59,085
Hey. Where were you tonight?
We missed you Boog.

1407
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,077
Yeah. You chicken out?

1408
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,581
Yep, I chickened out.

1409
01:30:06,567 --> 01:30:09,794
Listen, Boog.
I think you should get out of here.

1410
01:30:09,904 --> 01:30:11,306
Tank's inside.

1411
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:14,466
Yeah, why don't you
wait out here till he splits?

1412
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:20,013
No, he's just gonna catch up with me
sooner or later.

1413
01:30:22,166 --> 01:30:26,144
I mean the hand's dealt.
I might as well just play the cards.

1414
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:34,537
What do you think we should do,
in case something happens?

1415
01:30:34,637 --> 01:30:36,404
I don't know.

1416
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:48,750
Boog.

1417
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:51,179
How are you doing, Tank?

1418
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:53,004
You're a lucky man, Boog.

1419
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:56,142
Yeah. Is that so?

1420
01:30:56,242 --> 01:31:01,680
This donkey in here, Bagel,
he paid your whole tab.

1421
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:06,944
Bagel paid the money that I owe you?

1422
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:09,646
Yeah, Boog.
You're straight, like an arrow.

1423
01:31:12,091 --> 01:31:14,285
Shame, shame.

1424
01:31:14,385 --> 01:31:16,403
- Hey, Tank.
- Yeah?

1425
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:21,283
All right, Boogie!

1426
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:24,202
- Whoo!
- I owed you that.

1427
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:27,715
- What a punch, ladies and gentlemen.
- Yeah, Boog.

1428
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,301
- Nice punch. He put him down.
- Nice going.

1429
01:31:30,401 --> 01:31:34,305
Smile of the week.
Definitely the smile of the week.

1430
01:31:34,405 --> 01:31:37,173
- What do you say, George?
- Nothing.

1431
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:45,849
Thanks a lot, Bagel.
I really appreciate it.

1432
01:31:46,417 --> 01:31:47,944
Your mother called me.

1433
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:50,687
- She did?
- Yeah. She was hysterical.

1434
01:31:51,088 --> 01:31:53,898
So, you know, out of respect
for your father.

1435
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:59,622
Your mother told me you're just
wasting your time in law school.

1436
01:31:59,722 --> 01:32:01,406
It's not for you. What do you say?

1437
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,127
Yeah, well, she's probably right.

1438
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:06,754
So why don't you come work for me?

1439
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:09,173
Boog, you can't imagine...

1440
01:32:09,273 --> 01:32:12,051
how much money there is to be made
in home-improvement.

1441
01:32:12,151 --> 01:32:15,629
And I can't think of anybody
who'd do it better than you would.

1442
01:32:17,490 --> 01:32:21,978
Well, I'll tell you. You know,
I was only going to law school...

1443
01:32:22,078 --> 01:32:24,422
as a come-on for the girls.

1444
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:26,399
They like that.

1445
01:32:26,499 --> 01:32:29,809
- Do they like it a lot?
- Yeah. They like it.

1446
01:32:30,294 --> 01:32:33,897
I mean, what the hell?
You know, I could lie.

1447
01:32:35,800 --> 01:32:40,737
Hey, Florence, could I have some
French fries with gravy, please?

1448
01:32:41,305 --> 01:32:45,075
We'll call the $2000 an advance?

1449
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:50,538
Okay.

1450
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:54,834
Okay, but I've got
to tell you something, Bagel.

1451
01:32:55,152 --> 01:32:58,973
I'll work with you for a little while
until we square it off.

1452
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:02,300
But, you know I got plans.

1453
01:33:03,202 --> 01:33:05,136
Always a dreamer, hey, Boog?

1454
01:33:06,664 --> 01:33:10,350
If you don't have good dreams, Bagel,
you got nightmares.

1455
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:20,369
I'll tell you one thing that happens
when you get married.

1456
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:22,654
You have to give up your old friends.

1457
01:33:22,763 --> 01:33:25,541
Because the wife wants you
to get new friends.

1458
01:33:25,641 --> 01:33:26,991
And new friends?

1459
01:33:27,977 --> 01:33:31,255
Nope. Because you and me, buddy...

1460
01:33:31,355 --> 01:33:33,665
we got secrets she'll never know.

1461
01:33:34,025 --> 01:33:38,054
Never know. Those new friends
could never be as good.

1462
01:33:38,154 --> 01:33:39,347
Nope.

1463
01:33:39,447 --> 01:33:43,049
Because we've... We've got a history.

1464
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:45,385
A history.

1465
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:50,557
It won't change, Ed. Only if you let it.

1466
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:55,645
This is getting me crazy. Come on.
Pick it up, you guys.

1467
01:34:02,261 --> 01:34:04,080
You want to pick up the beat?

1468
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:07,333
- Be quiet or we'll get thrown out.
- You gonna pick up the beat?

1469
01:34:07,433 --> 01:34:09,826
You gonna pick up the beat?

1470
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:43,860
It's classical.

1471
01:35:01,195 --> 01:35:03,213
That's crazy, man.

1472
01:35:16,460 --> 01:35:18,686
I'll pay for it. No problem.

1473
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:22,899
My buddy!

1474
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,992
- All right. All right.
- That's better.

1475
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:46,464
Come on, honey. You can shake it.

1476
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,732
Billy, you've got magic fingers.

1477
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:20,308
A regular Fats Domino.

1478
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:33,289
Hold on a second.

1479
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:35,374
Come on. Come on.
First joke you remember.

1480
01:37:35,474 --> 01:37:38,669
All right. All right. Okay.

1481
01:37:38,769 --> 01:37:42,288
Fifth grade, Junior Scholastic Magazine.

1482
01:37:43,023 --> 01:37:47,470
Okay. Hickory dickory doc.
The mouse ran up the clock.

1483
01:37:47,570 --> 01:37:51,174
The clock struck one, and the other two
escaped with minor injuries.

1484
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:52,975
- Boo. Boo.
- Minor...

1485
01:37:53,075 --> 01:37:54,185
Boo.

1486
01:37:54,285 --> 01:37:57,104
- That's terrible.
- Fifth-grade humor.

1487
01:37:57,204 --> 01:38:00,682
Since then, it's moved up
to the sixth grade. Is that it?

1488
01:38:06,171 --> 01:38:08,949
- You're all right.
- You guys have really made my night.

1489
01:38:09,049 --> 01:38:11,243
You should come down
and hang out more often.

1490
01:38:11,343 --> 01:38:13,695
I can't. I'm getting married.

1491
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:18,167
She would have gotten that Alan Ameche
question that Shrev screwed up.

1492
01:38:18,267 --> 01:38:21,045
- Benefit of the doubt.
- Exactly.

1493
01:38:21,145 --> 01:38:22,996
I love weddings.

1494
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:28,093
I just never found the time to settle,
or even wanted to.

1495
01:38:28,193 --> 01:38:30,221
And you?

1496
01:38:30,321 --> 01:38:31,472
No marriage.

1497
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:33,339
Got a girl?

1498
01:38:34,241 --> 01:38:37,144
Not really. Just in love.

1499
01:38:37,244 --> 01:38:40,397
- Does the girl know?
- Yeah, I told her about it.

1500
01:38:40,497 --> 01:38:42,274
Told her.

1501
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:44,475
Didn't you show her?

1502
01:39:14,531 --> 01:39:15,631
Come on.

1503
01:39:31,757 --> 01:39:33,149
Nice morning.

1504
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,276
Yes, it is.

1505
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:39,614
Mornings, I've often felt,
are a nice time to ride.

1506
01:39:40,891 --> 01:39:44,118
- Do you live around here?
- Well, not around here. Here.

1507
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,747
Which means, you're trespassing.

1508
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:51,334
- I'm just waiting for an invite.
- So let's ride.

1509
01:39:51,694 --> 01:39:54,128
- What's your name?
- Boogie.

1510
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:56,923
- Boogie?
- Bobby Sheftell.

1511
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:17,652
Isn't she beautiful?

1512
01:40:26,020 --> 01:40:29,330
- What is that music?
- It's the Colts' marching song.

1513
01:40:29,898 --> 01:40:33,209
It's very tasteful. Very tasteful.

1514
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:46,440
In the presence of this company
as witness, you have spoken the words...

1515
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:50,861
and performed the rites
which unite your lives.

1516
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:56,492
I therefore declare, you Edward,
and you Elyse...

1517
01:40:56,592 --> 01:40:58,818
husband and wife.

1518
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:04,124
And now I ask you,
and all your dear ones here...

1519
01:41:04,224 --> 01:41:06,826
to bow your heads in reverence.

1520
01:41:07,561 --> 01:41:11,632
Silently, let us pray,
that God will bless your home...

1521
01:41:11,732 --> 01:41:15,928
and help you to achieve
your highest hopes.

1522
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,888
Amen.

1523
01:41:17,988 --> 01:41:20,307
One, two, one, two, three.

1524
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:23,384
- One, two, one, two, three.
- One...

1525
01:41:24,453 --> 01:41:26,897
- You look very pretty.
- Thank you.

1526
01:41:26,997 --> 01:41:29,098
Blue becomes you.

1527
01:41:31,168 --> 01:41:34,905
Hey, I made us some reservations...

1528
01:41:35,005 --> 01:41:37,032
for the summer in the Poconos.

1529
01:41:37,132 --> 01:41:38,524
For how long?

1530
01:41:38,675 --> 01:41:41,120
I think we might go for 10 days.

1531
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:43,613
Ten days is good, yeah.

1532
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:07,803
I'm thinking of going to Europe.

1533
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:12,600
Why don't you stay in the United States
and just travel around?

1534
01:42:13,127 --> 01:42:18,231
I don't know. It's been done. Europe.
Europe looks like a smile.

1535
01:42:21,927 --> 01:42:24,111
Yes, I'll have my master's in business.

1536
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:28,115
And then, I guess I'll come back.

1537
01:42:28,809 --> 01:42:33,338
Blue moon

1538
01:42:33,438 --> 01:42:36,717
You saw me standing alone

1539
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:39,794
Every time we go to a wedding,
we got to listen to this guy.

1540
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:44,391
Without a dream in my heart

1541
01:42:44,491 --> 01:42:47,853
Yeah, I'll visit you, of course.
I'm not moving to another country.

1542
01:42:47,953 --> 01:42:51,806
Please come back soon.
I'll make you sandwiches. All right?

1543
01:42:54,877 --> 01:42:59,448
Blue moon

1544
01:42:59,548 --> 01:43:04,402
You knew just what I was there for

1545
01:43:06,263 --> 01:43:09,917
You heard me saying a prayer for

1546
01:43:10,017 --> 01:43:12,628
Gonna get some hors d'oeuvres.
Would you like anything?

1547
01:43:12,728 --> 01:43:16,622
Yeah, Bobby. Can I have a few more
of whatever these are?

1548
01:43:18,442 --> 01:43:20,668
They're good. Thank you.

1549
01:43:32,581 --> 01:43:34,223
Hi, boys.

1550
01:43:36,251 --> 01:43:38,612
Hello, test.

1551
01:43:38,712 --> 01:43:43,659
I don't want to bother you.
I just wanted to say a few words.

1552
01:43:43,759 --> 01:43:46,495
I didn't prepare anything or anything.

1553
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:50,374
The guys told me to come up
and say a few words.

1554
01:43:50,474 --> 01:43:55,879
I was thinking that, you know,
now that Eddie's getting married...

1555
01:43:55,979 --> 01:43:59,290
and he won't really be hanging out
with the guys anymore...

1556
01:43:59,441 --> 01:44:02,970
I just wanted to say that we were
never really that crazy about you.

1557
01:44:03,070 --> 01:44:05,046
I'll be quite honest.

1558
01:44:05,197 --> 01:44:09,467
I didn't want to tell you sooner
because you're a sensitive person.

1559
01:44:10,077 --> 01:44:14,648
I just want to thank everybody
who's responsible for your being here.

1560
01:44:14,748 --> 01:44:19,695
Elyse, I don't know if everybody knows what
Elyse had to go through to get married.

1561
01:44:19,795 --> 01:44:24,116
She was two points away from spending
the rest of her life by herself.

1562
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:26,285
It was very... It was sad.

1563
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:30,289
And now she knows more about football
than most girls in America.

1564
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:32,708
It's important, it really is.

1565
01:44:32,808 --> 01:44:39,298
I mean, we all know most marriages depend
on a firm grasp of football trivia.

1566
01:44:42,401 --> 01:44:45,637
Eddie gets crazy sometimes with sports.
I don't know if you know him.

1567
01:44:45,737 --> 01:44:49,715
I mean, it's one thing to dress the room
in blue and white, with banners...

1568
01:44:49,950 --> 01:44:53,478
and the cake in the shape of a football.
It was a little too much.

1569
01:44:53,578 --> 01:44:56,398
I thought it was out of line
when Eddie asked the rabbi...

1570
01:44:56,498 --> 01:45:01,018
to wear black and white stripes
and a whistle. That was wrong.

1571
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:07,942
So, Eddie's mother, I know,
is very upset that he's leaving the house.

1572
01:46:12,908 --> 01:46:14,476
Would you look at this?

1573
01:46:14,576 --> 01:46:17,312
Another article talking
about this theory of evolution.

1574
01:46:17,412 --> 01:46:18,855
Can I have the "Sports" page?

1575
01:46:18,955 --> 01:46:21,233
Do you believe this?
I don't buy the whole thing.

1576
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:24,903
They're saying that millions of
years ago there was a swamp.

1577
01:46:25,003 --> 01:46:26,488
I don't want to hear it.

1578
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:28,740
In the middle of
this murky, disgusting...

1579
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:30,951
boggy water swamp, there's an amoeba.

1580
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:32,744
This amoeba meets another amoeba...

1581
01:46:32,844 --> 01:46:35,580
and they have a kid who's a fish
who crawls onto land.

1582
01:46:35,680 --> 01:46:38,125
And from one lousy amoeba
millions of years ago...

1583
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:42,546
that today there's some guy with
a winter coat on a corner yelling "Taxi!"

1584
01:46:42,646 --> 01:46:44,965
Where's that connection?
How can that possibly be?

1585
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:47,884
- An amoeba has no legs.
- Why do you care how we evolved?

1586
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:50,002
They can float.

1587
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:53,432
- We're all animals.
- You're gonna argue this with him?

1588
01:46:53,532 --> 01:46:56,435
It's not just people. It's not
even animals, chickens, come on.

1589
01:46:56,535 --> 01:46:59,313
- How could chickens live in a swamp?
- That's ridiculous.

1590
01:46:59,413 --> 01:47:01,815
They can't even make it
out of a pot of frying oil.

1591
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:05,277
Think of chickens, dogs, birds, cows,
little Cocker Spaniel puppies...

1592
01:47:05,377 --> 01:47:08,196
living in a muddy swamp.
It's enough to make you sick.

1593
01:47:08,296 --> 01:47:11,450
Girls don't come from the
same swamp, that's for sure.

1594
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,869
I don't know who makes up this stuff.

1595
01:47:13,969 --> 01:47:17,873
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
People do not come from swamps.

1596
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:20,241
They come from Europe.

1597
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:26,340
- Where do people in Europe come from?
- What am I? Rand McNally? It's...

1598
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,642
Ba-da-boom.

1599
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:31,178
Let me ask you something personal.

1600
01:47:31,278 --> 01:47:32,387
Sure.

1601
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:34,348
Is it true you took out Arlene Stanton?

1602
01:47:35,782 --> 01:47:37,601
- You heard that?
- Yeah.

1603
01:47:37,701 --> 01:47:39,269
Get out of here. Of course not.

1604
01:47:39,369 --> 01:47:41,730
Come on. You touched Arlene.

1605
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:44,399
- Would you look at her? Would you...?
- Would you?

1606
01:47:44,499 --> 01:47:46,360
You're embarrassed, don't want to say.

1607
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,070
- Get out of here.
- Did you?

1608
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:50,989
- Once. I took her once.
- Did you spend money on her?

1609
01:47:51,089 --> 01:47:53,408
I'm not marrying the girl.
I went out for a drive.

1610
01:47:53,508 --> 01:47:56,411
- Why did you deny it when I asked you?
- I didn't deny that.

1611
01:47:56,511 --> 01:47:57,746
Wouldn't you deny it?

1612
01:47:57,846 --> 01:48:00,749
I just want to ask you a question.
Did you touch her, at all?

1613
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:02,000
Of course not.

1614
01:48:02,100 --> 01:48:04,920
- Did you touch anything she touched?
- Did she touch you?

1615
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:07,204
You guys are sick, you know that.

1616
01:48:07,314 --> 01:48:09,341
I heard you kissed her goodnight.

1617
01:48:09,441 --> 01:48:12,084
I'm dropping her off.
You got to be polite.

1618
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:14,503
Remind me never to kiss you.

1619
01:48:14,654 --> 01:48:18,100
- I'll make a note about that one, Shrev.
- Disgusting, Shrevie.

1620
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,102
- You want to hear one?
- Yeah, go.

1621
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:22,771
This guy's going home from work.
He has a brand new car.

1622
01:48:22,871 --> 01:48:24,606
- What kind?
- Doesn't matter.

1623
01:48:24,706 --> 01:48:27,275
- Brand new car, it doesn't matter.
- Let's hear it.

1624
01:48:27,375 --> 01:48:29,226
So he pulls into this bar.

1625
01:48:29,503 --> 01:48:33,031
He says "Give me...
Give me a scotch and soda."

1626
01:48:34,466 --> 01:48:36,785
- He's drunk, right.
- That's not funny.

1627
01:48:39,387 --> 01:48:42,624
Would you let me tell the joke?
So he says:

1628
01:48:42,724 --> 01:48:46,368
"Yeah, give me a scotch and soda."
And so the bartender says:

1629
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,839
"Do you really think
you should be having one?"

1630
01:48:48,939 --> 01:48:50,382
- Why?
- Why?

1631
01:48:50,482 --> 01:48:53,427
- Why what?
- Why should he not be having one?

1632
01:48:53,527 --> 01:48:57,556
I'm just telling you the joke.
I don't know why he asks him, all right?

1633
01:48:57,656 --> 01:48:59,766
So he looks at the guy and says:

1634
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,811
"Sir, maybe it's none of
my business, but..."

1635
01:49:02,911 --> 01:49:04,771
- Oh, what?
- He forgot something.

1636
01:49:04,871 --> 01:49:06,982
This guy has no arms and no legs.

1637
01:49:07,082 --> 01:49:08,608
How could he drive the car?

1638
01:49:08,708 --> 01:49:10,777
It's a funny joke,
but it doesn't work now.

1639
01:49:10,877 --> 01:49:11,987
Finish it.

1640
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:14,823
No, I'm starting a joke.
I spend 10 minutes building a joke.

1641
01:49:14,923 --> 01:49:17,659
- Let him finish.
- Now it's not going to be funny.

1642
01:49:17,759 --> 01:49:19,578
- Come on.
- It's not funny now.

1643
01:49:19,678 --> 01:49:21,496
- Tell the joke.
- Just say it.

1644
01:49:21,596 --> 01:49:25,500
Do you remember that time
they brought a girl in here?

1645
01:49:25,600 --> 01:49:26,751
When was that?

1646
01:49:26,851 --> 01:49:30,046
- The only girl that ever set foot...
- They brought a girl here.

1647
01:49:30,146 --> 01:49:31,590
There's never been a woman.

1648
01:49:31,690 --> 01:49:34,509
- When we were in 10th grade...
- Everybody was younger.

1649
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:36,845
- This place was great then.
- It was great.

1650
01:49:36,945 --> 01:49:39,598
Nice cars then?

1651
01:49:39,698 --> 01:49:42,851
It used to be so cool to be older
and hang out here, and now...

1652
01:49:42,951 --> 01:49:46,720
But now we're older, and we're cooler,
and we're still hanging out here.
