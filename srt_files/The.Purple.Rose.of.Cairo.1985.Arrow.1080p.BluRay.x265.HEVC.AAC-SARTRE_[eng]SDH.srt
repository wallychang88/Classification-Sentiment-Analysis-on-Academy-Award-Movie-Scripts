- Yeah.

25
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,793
You're gonna like this one. It's better
than last week's. More romantic.

26
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,380
Miss, I wanted oatmeal
before my scrambled eggs.

27
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,466
I'm sorry. I'll get it right away. Sorry.

28
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:15,761
- (Man) I get cereal and a doughnut.
- Cereal and a doughnut. Right.

29
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:19,848
- There's a new movie at the Jewel.
- I didn't even get to see last week's.

30
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:23,519
Oh, you missed it?
It was wonderful. I love Jane Froman.

31
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,146
James Melton plays...
First he's a hotel porter.

32
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:29,191
Then he becomes a radio singer
and then an opera singer.

33
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:31,360
The music was just beautiful.

34
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:34,029
You know, the one that I liked
is "OK, America".

35
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:37,199
Oh, yeah. I saw that twice. That was great.

36
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,620
- When she threatens to kill Lew Ayres...
- I love him. Do you think he's married?

37
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,958
Is he? Are you crazy?
Yes, he's married to Ginger Rogers.

38
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,628
God. They got married on a boat
off the island of Catalina.

39
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:52,798
They live in Beverly Hills
and sometimes holiday in Spain.

40
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,343
He used to be married to Lola Lane,
but Ginger's better for him...

41
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,221
- Where's my toast?
- Oh. Coming right up. One second.

42
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,723
- Ginger was married to Jack...
- Let's go, girls.

43
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,977
- Sorry.
- Let's go, Cecilia. Your sister is slow.

44
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:08,397
- But she's still learning.
- Ladies, there's a depression on.

45
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:10,899
Others would like this job,
if you can't handle it.

46
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,860
I can handle it. It's OK.

47
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:17,489
Ginger was married to Jack Culpepper,
who took out Ruth Chatterton

48
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:19,157
before she married George...

49
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:23,620
- That's the second one this week.
- I'm sorry. I'll pick it all up.

50
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:26,248
Come on, Cecilia. Shape up.

51
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,044
Add 'em up. Down by three pennies.

52
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,470
Hey, Monk. Here comes your wife.

53
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,018
Boy, am I glad to see you.
You got any dough?

54
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,687
Oh, the tips weren't so good today.

55
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,939
Give me something. I'm busted.

56
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:54,443
I hear there's some jobs
opening up over at the ice factory.

57
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:57,237
- No, there's nothing. I was there.
- Yeah?

58
00:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,657
Harriet Rufus says all you guys do
all clay is just pitch pennies

59
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:03,368
and make passes
at the girls who walk by.

60
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,203
Harriet Rufus is a douchebag.

61
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,956
Listen, I gotta save the rest
for groceries.

62
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,627
Yeah, OK. Yeah, right. Got it?
What are you doin' here?

63
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,087
Wanna go to the movies?
There's an early show.

64
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,882
I can't. The guys are comin' over tonight.

65
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,259
- Again?
- What, you don't like it?

66
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:25,807
Well, all you do is drink and play dice,
and I wind up getting smacked.

67
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,226
I gotta get even, don't I?
I owe everybody in town.

68
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:31,688
You're never home anymore,
except to play dice and cards.

69
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:35,567
Meanwhile, I gotta take in extra laundry
after work to pay the rent.

70
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,903
What do you want?
Did I close the factory?

71
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,573
- You didn't used to be like this, Monk.
- Well, I got a lot on my mind.

72
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,494
You think I like scratchin' around for
work? Livin' like a bum for two years?

73
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,038
I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.

74
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:52,459
Listen, the country'll get workin' again.
Things are bound to get better. I promise.

75
00:04:52,584 --> 00:04:56,838
- You know I'm crazy about you, huh?
- You never pay attention to me anymore.

76
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:01,426
So I thought, if we could go to the movies
tonight, you could forget your troubles.

77
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,639
Forget my troubles. Cecilia,
you like sitting through that junk, OK?

78
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:07,808
I'm gonna shoot crap, OK?

79
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,018
Go to the movie by yourself.

80
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,689
- You make passes at the girls who go by?
- Look, you're not my boss.

81
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,943
And don't give me that look. You'd think
I was a criminal. Come on. Give us a hug.

82
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:21,071
Just one. Come on. All right? Good.

83
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,657
And don't come home late. I worry.

84
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,785
All right? See you later?

85
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,957
- (Claps hands)
- Let's go.

86
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,425
Two, please.

87
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:44,845
Two.

88
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:50,225
Just one tonight, please, Doris.
Thank you.

89
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:56,982
- Evening, Mr Ruskin.
- Hi, Cecilia.

90
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,242
<i>Jason, I'm bored.</i>

91
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:52,496
<i>I'm bored with cocktail parties
and opening nights.</i>

92
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:55,415
<i>I'm bored with the opera
and weekends at the races.</i>

93
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,294
<i>A few days in Paris might be the thing
to get the creative juices flowing.</i>

94
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,588
<i>I can have George cable the Ritz
for the usual suite.</i>

95
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,089
<i>I'm not talking about Paris!</i>

96
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,842
<i>I'm talking about
some place completely different.</i>

97
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:08,762
<i>Like Morocco. Or Egypt.</i>

98
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:12,140
<i>Ooh. A boat trip down the Nile.
Sounds so romantic.</i>

99
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,893
<i>I've got just the dress
to wear to the pyramids.</i>

100
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,688
<i>Hey, we could leave next week.
Spend a couple of weeks there.</i>

101
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,858
<i>Maybe stop in Casablanca or Tangiers,
as we hop around...</i>

102
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,653
<i>and still be back in time
for the opening of my new play.</i>

103
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:27,405
<i>To Cairo, Morocco and Tangiers...</i>

104
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,535
<i>...to all the exotic and romantic places
in the world.</i>

105
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,624
<i>- Hey, there's another room in here.
- Oh, isn't it divine?</i>

106
00:07:37,749 --> 00:07:39,543
<i>Everything's so perfectly preserved.</i>

107
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:43,296
<i>Lovely. I just don't want to feel
a bandaged hand around my throat.</i>

108
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,966
- (Woman gasps)
<i>- Oh, hi, there. Who are you?</i>

109
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,260
(Man)<i> Oh, we're sightseeing.
We thought we were alone.</i>

110
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,095
<i>You gave me quite a start.</i>

111
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,181
<i>Oh. I'm awfully sorry.
Tom Baxter, explorer, adventurer.</i>

112
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,685
<i>- I'm doing a little archaeological work
- A real-life explorer!</i>

113
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,979
<i>I'm in search of
the Purple Rose of Cairo.</i>

114
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:02,023
<i>It's an old legend
that's fascinated me for years.</i>

115
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,734
<i>A pharaoh had a rose
painted purple for his queen</i>

116
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,363
<i>and now the story says
purple roses grow wild at her tomb.</i>

117
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,824
<i>- How romantic.
- And you?</i>

118
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:14,160
<i>We go back to New York tomorrow.
It's been a refreshing two weeks.</i>

119
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:18,039
<i>We could take him to meet the
Countess. She loves a pith helmet.</i>

120
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:21,167
<i>- Right.
- I will say it's tempting.</i>

121
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:24,796
<i>It's settled. You can explain what
we've been looking at for two weeks</i>

122
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:29,259
<i>- and we can take you nightclubbing
- It's so impulsive, but...</i>

123
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:33,889
<i>I'll come. Why not? I mean,
what's life without a little risk-taking?</i>

124
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:38,018
<i>Who knows? A fortune teller predicted
I'd fall in love in New York.</i>

125
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:46,568
<i>- Table for six, please, Arturo
- Six, sir.</i>

126
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:08,840

137
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,394
Come on. The man wants his cheque.

138
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,771
Oh, sorry. Here you go.

139
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,648
Right. Sorry.

140
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,776
- So what were you thinking about?
- Oh...

141
00:10:09,901 --> 00:10:14,489
A penthouse. The desert.
Kissing on a dance floor.

142
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,242
So you did go to the movies
last night after all?

143
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:22,163
The people were so beautiful. They spoke
so cleverly and do such romantic things.

144
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,001
- Gosh, I'm sorry I missed it.
- The one playing Tom was so cute.

145
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,461
Do you wanna go after work?
I'd love to see it again.

146
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,589
What is this? A social club?
I got a sink full of dirty dishes.

147
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:34,175
Come on, girls. Come on.

148
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,929
Thanks a lot.

149
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,976
<i>(Tom) Well, I am impressed.</i>

150
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:46,354
<i>I really am.
You have yourself quite a place here.</i>

151
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:50,442

155
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:05,790
<i>Oh, no, no thanks. I think I'll wait for that
glass of champagne at the Copacabana.</i>

156
00:11:08,877 --> 00:11:10,879
I'm home, Monk.

157
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,341
What are you doing home so early?
I said you could go to the movies.

158
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:16,968
- Yeah, I did.
- (Woman laughs)

159
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:24,684
- I'd better go.
- No, stay. This is Cecilia.

160
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,229
Uh, this is my friend Olga.
Olga's an acrobat.

161
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,319
I am not. I have to go home.

162
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:36,613
Come on. I was gonna tell your fortune.

163
00:11:36,738 --> 00:11:39,282
- You're drunk.
- What? I'm not drunk.

164
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,203
Come on. Don't worry about her. She's
my ball and chain. Or she tries to be.

165
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,705
Olga. Olga, where the hell are you going?

166
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,500
Hey, Olga. Come on,
I want to show you a card trick.

167
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,835
- (Olga laughs)
- (Monk) Olga!

168
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,799
(Door closes)

169
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:13,233
Is there any more of that meat loaf left?

170
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,820
That stuff you made
yesterday was delicious.

171
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,949
- (Monk) What's goin' on?
- I'm movin' out.

172
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:24,744
Oh, what are you talkin' about?
What's wrong?

173
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:29,082
What? Because of before?
Because of Olga? Is that it?

174
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,751
Because that'd be funny.
That'd be ridiculous.

175
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,255
If it's because of Olga,
you'd be a bigger fool than usual.

176
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,340
Pardon me.

177
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:41,719
She's Joe Caruso's sister,
and I was just showin' her a card trick.

178
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:44,013
Your undershirt's on backwards.

179
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:49,394
I put it on that way this morning. Now,
listen, Cecilia, you're makin' a mistake.

180
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,021
All right. I'm sorry. I was drinkin'.

181
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,523
You know how I get when I drink.

182
00:12:53,648 --> 00:12:56,401
- You think it means I don't love you?
- Move.

183
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,155
You can't leave. I need you.

184
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:05,160
And... and you know I love you.
Now, look, I made a mistake.

185
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,162
- You don't love me.
- Baby, come on.

186
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:10,874
You don't.
You treat me bad and you beat up on me.

187
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,876
Look, I hit you when you get out of line.

188
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:17,630
I never just hit you, I warn you first.
If you don't shape up, you get whacked.

189
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,257
- I'm leaving.
- Listen, Cecilia.

190
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:23,386
I don't know who's fillin' your head full of
these crazy notions, but I've had enough.

191
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,515
I want supper. Get my meat loaf.

192
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,225
Uh-uh.

193
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,061
Come on, Cecilia.
You know I can't live without you.

194
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:34,981
- I'm like a little kid when it comes to you.
- That's tough.

195
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:39,027
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean, I'm really sorry. Can't I be sorry?

196
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:42,155
I drink, I get crazy.
It's not me, it's the whiskey.

197
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,242
- I'm going, Monk. I'm going.
- Jesus Christ. I can't reason with you.

198
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,246
All right, go ahead. Let's see how far
you get. Go on, go on. You won't last.

199
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,875
You see how it is out in the real world.
Go on. You'll come back.

200
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,669
You're just bluff. You're all phoney.

201
00:13:56,794 --> 00:14:01,799
You'll be back. It may take a week,
it may take an hour, but you'll be back.

202
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:27,200
Oh, jeez. Look at all those guys.

203
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,327
C'mon, honey. We're gonna make a buck.

204
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,353
(Snoring)

205
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:05,029
I ordered bacon and tomato.
You brought me ham and Swiss.

206
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,156
I'll get it right away, ma'am.

207
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,866
Cecilia, I want you to meet somebody.

208
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,661
I said I was gonna keep my eyes open
for eligible men.

209
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:15,456
- Oh, come on.
- Come on, just keep an open mind.

210
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,876
This is my sister, Cecilia.
This is Mr Teddy Ashcroft.

211
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,712
- How do you do?
- Charmed.

212
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,839
Teddy's an exterminator.

213
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:27,635
Right. Merson Pest Control.
My speciality are mice and silverfish.

214
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,431
- Pleased to meet you.
- Waitress, please! My hamburger.

215
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:33,099
- Cheque, please.
- I'll be right there.

216
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:34,976
- (Smashing crockery)
- Oh...

217
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:37,603
That's it, Cecilia.
You're fired. Get out.

218
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,648
I'll pay for it. I'll be more careful.

219
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,359
Out. Take off your apron.
Go home. You're fired!

220
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:46,612
- If she goes, then I go too.
- That's fine with me.

221
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,741
She doesn't mean that.
You've got kids. She doesn't mean that.

222
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:53,745
Then tell her to mind
her own business. You're fired.

223
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,594
<i>Back from Egypt.
From the Bedouins to Broadway.</i>

224
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,890
<i>I'm not religious, but I vow never to
fly over the Atlantic in bumpy weather</i>

225
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:17,226
<i>and never to look at another camel.
Drinks, anyone?</i>

226
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,356
(Woman)<i> I can't wait to get out of these
clothes and hit some of the nightspots.</i>

227
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:25,777
(Jason)<i> Don't waste time. The floor
show at the Copacabana starts soon.</i>

228
00:16:25,902 --> 00:16:28,571
<i>We're meeting
the Countess and Larry Wilde.</i>

229
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,866
<i>Well, I am impressed. I really am.</i>

230
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,744
<i>You have yourself quite a place here.</i>

231
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:38,831
<i>I still can't get over the fact that
24 hours ago I was in an Egyptian tomb.</i>

232
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:42,335
<i>I didn't know any of you wonderful
people, and here I am now.</i>

233
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,130
<i>I'm on the verge of
a madcap Manhattan weekend.</i>

234
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,217
<i>I hope you like your martinis very dry.</i>

235
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:53,763
<i>(Tom) No thanks. I think I'll wait for that
glass of champagne at the Copacabana.</i>

236
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:03,940
<i>Miss Rita, somethin' on your mind?</i>

237
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:07,443
<i>You ain't been yourself since
you come back from them pyramids.</i>

238
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,779
<i>No, it's nothing. I'll be OK.</i>

239
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:14,450
<i>I don't suspect it has anything to do
with that explorer fellow, Mr Tom Baxter.</i>

240
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,328
<i>Now, why would you say that?</i>

241
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,373
<i>The way he speaks, all romantic-like.</i>

242
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:24,168
<i>Yeah. Come on, Delilah. Draw my bath.</i>

243
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,878
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

244
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:31,008
<i>Now, will you be wantin'
the big bubbles or the asses' milk?</i>

245
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,936
<i>Boy, I can't wait to get out of these
clothes and hit some of the nightspots.</i>

246
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,274
<i>Children, don't waste time. The floor
show at the Copacabana starts soon.</i>

247
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,401
<i>We're meeting
the Countess and Larry Wilde.</i>

248
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:54,866
<i>Well, I am very impressed. I really am.
You have yourself quite a place here.</i>

249
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:59,120
<i>I still can't get over the fact that
24 hours ago I was in an Egyptian tomb.</i>

250
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,664
<i>I didn't know any
of you wonderful people...</i>

251
00:18:02,957 --> 00:18:08,296
<i>And here I am now. I'm on the verge
of a madcap... Manhattan... weekend.</i>

252
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,049
<i>My God, you must really love
this picture.</i>

253
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,343
- Me?
<i>- You've been here all day.</i>

254
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:17,680
<i>- And I've seen you here twice before</i>
- You mean me?

255
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,601
<i>Yes, you. This is
the fifth time you're seeing this.</i>

256
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,312
<i>Henry, come here, quickly.</i>

257
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,481
<i>- I gotta speak to you</i>
- (Audience gasps)

258
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:33,070
<i>- Old sport, you're on the wrong side
- Tom, we're in the middle of a story.</i>

259
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,656
I want to have a look around.
You go on without me.

260
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,576
- Who are you?
- Cecilia.

261
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,994
(Woman) I'll go get the manager.

262
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,623
- Let's go somewhere where we can talk.
- But you're in the movie.

263
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,166
Wrong, Cecilia. I'm free.

264
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:49,212
After 2,000 performances
of the same monotonous routine, I'm free.

265
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,507
<i>- Call Father Donnelly.
 - Tom!</i>

266
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,843
I don't understand.
What's going on? Who are you?

267
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,304
Who am I?
You've seen the movie five times.

268
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,641
I'm Tom Baxter, poet, adventurer,
of the Chicago Baxters.

269
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:05,269
I know you're Tom Baxter.
You wind up with Kitty Haynes. But...

270
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,271
- Not any more.
- What do you mean?

271
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:10,775
- I'm out before the wedding. I'm free.
- Don't you have to marry her?

272
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,278
- Not if I'm here and she's there.
- Don't you want to? She's beautiful.

273
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,157
- She's not for me. She's too bony.
- Kitty Haynes, the singer, is bony?

274
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:22,620
I need a place to hide. Look, I'm never
going back, now that I've met you.

275
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,332
A place to hide? A place to hide?

276
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:30,628
- What's happening? What's going on?
<i>- Tom's left. He just walked right out.</i>

277
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:32,463
<i>I don't know how he did it.
I can't get out.</i>

278
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,092
<i>It's disgusting. I am an heiress.
I don't have to put up with this.</i>

279
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:39,762
He left the picture?
Oh, my gosh. Well, don't panic.

280
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,056
Just stay up there and keep calm.

281
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,475
<i>- Calm? Are you crazy?<i>
<i>- Did you call for a priest?

282
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:48,104
<i>- Thank God you're here
- Wait a minute. This is the second reel.</i>

283
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:51,566
<i>- I'm not on till later</i>
- Can't you go on? There's an audience.

284
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,609
(Rita)<i> Tom was the linchpin
of the story.</i>

285
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,654
<i>That's right. Although this is, basically,
my story...</i>

286
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:59,031
<i>- What do you mean, your story?
- Tom lays out the facts.</i>

287
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,077
<i>- It's about a man's quest for fulfilment
- It's about a complex, tortured soul.</i>

288
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,330
<i>- About the effect of money on romance
- I don't think...</i>

289
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:11,043
<i>- My wealth, my private schools..
- I'm the one who marries royalty.</i>

290
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,878
<i>- Nobody cares.
- A humble kid... What?</i>

291
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:16,465
<i>- They wouldn't sell a ticket
- A humble kid from a small town...</i>

292
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,176
<i>- ...as far from royalty as you can get</i>
- Stop arguing.

293
00:20:19,302 --> 00:20:22,430
- (Rita)<i> And do what?</i>
- You should turn the projector off.

294
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:26,392
<i>No! Don't turn the projector off.
No, no. It gets black and we disappear.</i>

295
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:29,937
<i>Easy, easy. Easy. Easy, my son.
We're all in this together.</i>

296
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,274
<i>Yes, but you don't understand
what it's like to disappear.</i>

297
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:37,695
<i>To be nothing. To be annihilated.
Don't turn the projector off.</i>

298
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,239
<i>- Miss Rita, your bath is ready
- Not now, dear.</i>

299
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,283
<i>What's going on?</i>

300
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,993
<i>- What's he doing here?
- Have a martini.</i>

301
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,330
<i>- He shouldn't be here till reel six
- We know that.</i>

302
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:51,042
<i>- Somebody tryin' to hustle me?
- They're not trying to hustle you.</i>

303
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:55,546
(Tom) I know what this is.
It's an amusement park.

304
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,382
It's usually pretty dead
around here till summer.

305
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:02,803
I know exactly what an amusement park
is, and what goes on. I do.

306
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,681
- That's good.
- It's written into my character.

307
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,101
Remember? I invite Kitty to Luna Park,
but she prefers to stay home?

308
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:11,646
- Oh, yes.
- So it's in me.

309
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,857
- Oh, too bad nothing's open. I'm starved.
- Oh, you are?

310
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:18,861
I left the movie before the Copacabana
scenes. That's when I usually eat.

311
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,072
Oh, what am I thinking? Look, here.

312
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,116
I've got a whole bag of popcorn.
You can have that.

313
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,035
Also, I have a Milky Way bar.

314
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,580
- No, that's... Popcorn is...
- You might want it later.

315
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:33,209
Oh, boy.
So that's what popcorn tastes like.

316
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,921
I've been watching people eat it
for all those performances.

317
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:39,799
When they rattle those bags,
though, that's kind of annoying.

318
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:44,470
- I still don't understand what's going on.
- I wanted to meet you.

319
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:47,640
Don't tell me
you didn't see me looking at you.

320
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,684
When Kitty Haynes is doing her number?

321
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,687
Oh, wait a minute.
I remember seeing you kind of...

322
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:56,732
You were looking to the side somehow,
but I never thought it was to me.

323
00:21:56,857 --> 00:22:00,653
When we take the drive to that little
country inn? When I propose to Kitty?

324
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:03,531
- I was looking at you.
- Kitty looked so beautiful...

325
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,242
Oh, no. She's nothing compared to you.

326
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:08,911
What are you talking about?
I'm nothing.

327
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,288
Like hell you are. You're fetching.

328
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:13,082
- Fetching?
- Fetching.

329
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,710
Dad liked to say that
about Mom, in Chicago.

330
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,962
"Min," he'd say, "you're rather fetching".

331
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,256
(Cecilia titters)

332
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,592
Dad was a card. I never met him.
He died before the movie begins.

333
00:22:23,718 --> 00:22:29,265
Well, I have to confess, my eye
did always go to you up on the screen.

334
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:31,267
- Really?
- Really.

335
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:33,978
Even around Detective Simms
and Henry the playboy?

336
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:38,733
Yes. Even though you're not the main
character, you're the one you look at.

337
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:42,778
- You don't think I'm the main character?
- Oh, no, I didn't mean it that way.

338
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:46,407
No, I think you're positively essential.

339
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:50,536
In fact, every time I saw the movie, I kept
thinking "Tom Baxter's so handsome".

340
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,663
(Tom chuckles)

341
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,794
Shouldn't you be getting back?

342
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,797
I wanna live.
I wanna be free to make my own choices.

343
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,800
Right now, the country's
not in such great shape.

344
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,970
- What do you mean?
- We're in the middle of a depression.

345
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,806
Everybody's very poor.

346
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:14,143
I got plenty. Look at this.

347
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:18,189
But... but they need you.
The story doesn't work without you.

348
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,316
Cecilia, I'm in love with you.

349
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,528
- I'm married.
- Happily?

350
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:28,449
I really should get back home.
I have to cook dinner.

351
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:31,702
Slip away from your husband tonight.
Meet me here. I'll wait.

352
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:34,246
I want to learn about
the real world with you.

353
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,207
I can't.

354
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:39,794
Look at it this way. How many times
is a man so taken with a woman

355
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,379
that he walks off the screen to get her?

356
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,718
<i>OK, OK, let's not panic.
We're all adults.</i>

357
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,679
<i>I'm bored. I'm a dramatic character.
I need forward motion.</i>

358
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,307
<i>- It's the Countess and Larry
- Where is everybody?</i>

359
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,267
<i>Weren't we meeting at the Copacabana?</i>

360
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,602
<i>- Tom's gone.
- What?</i>

361
00:23:56,727 --> 00:23:57,853
<i>He left the film.</i>

362
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,897
<i>- What?
- The bum waked out on us</i>

363
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:03,943
<i>But the Copa is where we meet.
I'm trying to get him to marry me.</i>

364
00:24:04,068 --> 00:24:06,278
<i>Forget it. I'm tired of marrying you
every night.</i>

365
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,822
<i>Anyway, we never get to the bedroom.</i>

366
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,157
<i>- Where did Tom go?
- Into the real world.</i>

367
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,576
<i>That minor character leaves
and we're stuck.</i>

368
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:17,248
<i>- I wonder what it's like out there
- They don't look like they're having fun.</i>

369
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:21,877
- Hey, what the hell kind of movie is this?
- The paper said it was a romance!

370
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,922
<i>Don't tell us your sad stories.
You think we like this?</i>

371
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:29,844
Look at this. They sit around and talk,
and no action? Nothing happens?

372
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:32,137
I want my money back.
This is outrageous.

373
00:24:32,263 --> 00:24:34,306
<i>Stop yapping.
We've got problems of our own.</i>

374
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,934
You can't talk to my wife like that.

375
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,855
<i>I'm a countess with a lot of dough, and
if that's your wife, she's a tub of guts.</i>

376
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,316
(Cheering, whistling, and applause)

377
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:48,571
- (Glass shatters)
- (Cecilia) Oh.

378
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:53,576
- Hey, what are you so nervous about?
- Me? Oh, I'm not.

379
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:57,121
There's too much pepper in the sauce.
I told you to go easy on the pepper.

380
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,833
Hey, Monk? Are you...

381
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:04,461
I guess you and the guys are probably
going out again tonight, huh?

382
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,381
No, I'm not. My back is actin' up again.

383
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:10,009
Give me one of your rubdowns.
I bought liniment.

384
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,261
- Oh, no.
- What?

385
00:25:12,386 --> 00:25:14,638
Well, I... I can't.

386
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:17,308
What do you mean, you can't?

387
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:22,062
. I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean I can't.
I meant I made some plans.

388
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,481
- You made plans?
- Well, I... I did.

389
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:27,318
I... I said I'd baby-sit tonight.

390
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:32,615
I just... You know, I ran into Mrs Lorenzo
in the rest... I'm saying the restaurant.

391
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,327
In the street today.
She has some... I don't know.

392
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:40,915
I think it was a social club meeting
or something she wanted to go to.

393
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,376
- Yeah, it won't be too long.
- Yeah, well, I think it's a great idea.

394
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:47,296
- Yeah? Good.
- Yeah, because we can use every penny.

395
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,632
- Yeah.
- So what am I gonna do about my back?

396
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:53,510
Don't worry. You know, I can do some
now and I'll do some when I come in.

397
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:56,430
You shouldn't move around too much.
Just take it easy.

398
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,183
- If you go baby-sitting, get paid in cash.
- I will.

399
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,769
- Don't let her owe you.
- OK.

400
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,608
It's a miracle. A complete miracle.

401
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,568
We want our money back.

402
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,822
I don't pay to watch socialites
staring at us, making nasty remarks.

403
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,368
- Is that what they're doing?
- Last time I looked the priest had cards.

404
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,579
- They were playing pinochle.
- How did this happen?

405
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,666
It's probably those electrical storms.
The air is charged.

406
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,584
Fellas, I depend on the Jewel.

407
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:29,254
I got personal expenses, I got
no substitute picture to put in here.

408
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,590
I want my money back. This is a swindle.

409
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,593
There's no story. Mrs Lupus likes a story.

410
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:39,056
You should turn the projector off. This
could be the work of Reds or anarchists.

411
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:44,645
If he turns off the projector, you'll strand
Tom Baxter out in the world some place.

412
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:49,024
- You want an extra guy running around?
- I saw the movie last week. This is not it.

413
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,695
- Where is the Tom Baxter character?
- You'll get your money back.

414
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,280
I want what happened
in the movie last week to happen.

415
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,741
Otherwise, what's life about anyway?

416
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,911
Can't we go in and take a look?
We don't want to stay long.

417
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,539
If you want a seat,
you have to pay admission.

418
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:06,083
OK. Keep moving, folks.

419
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,295
<i>- Any word about Tom Baxter?</i>
- Nothing yet.

420
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:15,050
<i>So what are you doing here? We can't
continue the story till Tom gets back.</i>

421
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,802
Oh, we don't mind observing you all.

422
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:20,264
Yes. My husband is a student
of the human personality.

423
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,099
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, we're not human.</i>

424
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,435
It doesn't matter to Harold.
He has trouble with humans.

425
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,896
I have trouble? What,
do I have trouble with the real people?

426
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:32,067
I suppose you behave perfectly with
Donald? He won't speak to my son-in-law.

427
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,195
I won't speak? The kid is quiet.
He never makes conversation.

428
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:38,407
- He has to be drawn out.
- I don't like to draw people out.

429
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:42,077
That's what I said.
He has trouble with live humans.

430
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,955
- Yes. Yes, RKO.
- (Man) I want my money back!

431
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,876
I wanna speak to Mr Raoul Hirsch.

432
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,545
Yes, Mr Hirsch.

433
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:55,466
He's the producer of
"The Purple Rose of Cairo", yes.

434
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:59,136
No, he's not. Just tell him
I have a theatre in New Jersey

435
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,638
and there's a crisis with his film.

436
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:04,767
Yes, this is Mr Hirsch.
What's the problem?

437
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:07,061
What?

438
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,480
They're just sitting around on the screen.

439
00:28:09,605 --> 00:28:13,984
Rita, the Countess,
Larry Wilde, the playboy...

440
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:18,739
People are demanding their money back.
The theatre is nine-tenths empty.

441
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:22,576
- Come on, take a walk, will you?
- Look, he just walked out.

442
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:27,956
Baxter. The communist is screaming,
the priest in reel five is in reel two.

443
00:28:28,082 --> 00:28:31,627
How can he come off the screen?
It's never happened before.

444
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:34,671
That doesn't mean
it can't happen for a first time.

445
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:38,509
That's all you need. Hundreds of Tom
Baxters on the loose, running around.

446
00:28:38,634 --> 00:28:42,012
- Hundreds?
- As a lawyer, I advise you to get control.

447
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,223
A character from a film on the loose?

448
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:48,977
Who knows what he's capable of?
Robbery, murder... I see lawsuits.

449
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,855
I'd charter a plane right away
and I'd get down there fast.

450
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,775
Get me Gil Shepherd.

451
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,449
Sorry I'm not too light on my feet.

452
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,787
- Oh, no, you're a feather in my arms.
- Oh. Monk never took me dancing.

453
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:10,541
Not even when we first met.
Not even if I begged him.

454
00:29:10,666 --> 00:29:13,168
Really? So it's been bad for you.

455
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,338
Oh, it's been hard for everyone.

456
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:20,968
You know, living in a world
with no jobs and wars.

457
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,554
You probably never even
heard of the Great War.

458
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,889
- Sorry. I missed it.
- Yeah.

459
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:31,979
People get old, and sick,
and never find true love.

460
00:29:32,104 --> 00:29:35,399
Where I come from, people don't
disappoint. They're consistent.

461
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:40,904
- They're always reliable.
- You don't find that kind in real life.

462
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,990
You have.

463
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:55,419
Is it true they're talking to you
about the life of Lindbergh?

464
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:58,255
(Tom) It's nearly set,
but don't print it till it's firm.

465
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,841
You were great
in "The Purple Rose of Cairo".

466
00:30:00,966 --> 00:30:05,804
Thanks. I was... Did you know I was
singled out by all the East Coast critics?

467
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,557
Mm-hm. "The New York Times"
said that I was...

468
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:12,936
I had almost too smouldering
a quality to just play comedy.

469
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:16,148
Would you play Lindbergh
the way you played Tom Baxter?

470
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,276
Would I? No, of course not.
Tom was a change of pace for me.

471
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,570
He was... From my earlier roles.

472
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:28,285
I played Tom Baxter with a kind of
a poetic, idealistic quality that just...

473
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:32,414
Lindbergh was a loner.
He was... just self-reliant.

474
00:30:33,123 --> 00:30:35,584
I'd have to work it out with
my dialogue coach. He's a genius.

475
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:39,713
Gil, can I see you
for a minute, alone? Excuse me.

476
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,967
Tom Baxter's come down
off the screen. He's in New Jersey.

477
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:46,178
- What?
- I just spoke to Raoul Hirsch.

478
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,930
Nobody knows how, but he's done it.

479
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:51,475
- It's not physically possible.
- In New Jersey, anything can happen.

480
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,811
- But I created the character.
- That's my point!

481
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:58,106
As your agent, I'd hate to see
anything happen to your career.

482
00:30:58,232 --> 00:31:01,360
- Like what?
- Who knows? Your double's on the loose.

483
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,029
What's he up to?
Robbing banks? Raping broads?

484
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,740
- Is he?
- Who knows?

485
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,868
- The last thing we need is for you to get...
- Sh!

486
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:14,998
- Is for you to get a reputation as difficult.
- I'm not... It's not my fault.

487
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:19,878
Hirsch said, if you can't control your own
creation, nobody'll risk a picture on you.

488
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:24,007
- I worked so hard to make him real.
- Maybe you overdid it.

489
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:28,011
- I'll sue my dialogue coach, that louse.
- Fly down there and check into it, quick.

490
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,347
Now it's only one movie house,
but who knows?

491
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:35,143
- I'm afraid to fly.
- Gil, this is the scandal of all time.

492
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:38,105
You know what happened
to Fatty Arbuckle's career?

493
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:41,275
- I'll fly. I'll fly.
- Good.

494
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,153
This is how they drink
champagne in Cairo.

495
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,907
I never had champagne before.
It makes me feel silly.

496
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,243
- It's supposed to.
- Yes.

497
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:53,912
- The cheque, as you requested, sir.
- Ah.

498
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:58,458
- Oh, it's so much.
- I hope you found it to your liking, sir.

499
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,168
- It was superb.
- Wonderful.

500
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,296
My compliments to the chef.

501
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,173
And keep 20 per cent for yourself.

502
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:07,926
No, make that 30 per cent.

503
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,387
Yes. Quite amusing.

504
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:13,348
- What is?
- The fake money.

505
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:17,853
- Fake money?
- Is it play money, sir, or stage money?

506
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,817
Keep 30 per cent for yourself,
and stop looking so serious.

507
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,361
I'll get the maitre d'.

508
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,905
Tom, that's not real money!

509
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:31,867
What do you mean, it's not real money?

510
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:36,997
Oh, my God. It's...
Do you have any money?

511
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:41,209
- No. What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have to make a run for it.

512
00:32:41,335 --> 00:32:44,880
No, I can't run.
My ankles are bad from waitressing.

513
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,257
Just get up. Follow me.

514
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:03,106
Quick. Get in the car.

515
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:09,404
Tom, this is not our car.
We don't have a car. We came by foot.

516
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,407
- It doesn't go.
- Of course it doesn't. There's no key.

517
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:14,951
I don't understand.
This is how I go in a movie.

518
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:17,662
Tom, this is real life.
They don't start without a key.

519
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,540
- They don't? Let's go.
- You two. Get back here.

520
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,542
- They're leavin'.
- You can't run out on the cheque.

521
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,420
Deadbeats! Get back here now.

522
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:32,386
- I'm sorry about the money. I had no idea.
- Oh, that's OK.

523
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:36,139
It's not gonna be so easy
to get along without it in this world.

524
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,185
- I guess I have to get a job.
- That's not gonna be so easy either.

525
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:43,688
- The whole country's out of work.
- Well, then, we'll live on love.

526
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:46,691
We'll have to make concessions,
but we'll have each other.

527
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:50,445
- That's movie talk.
- You look so beautiful in this light.

528
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:53,907
But you're not real.

529
00:34:01,832 --> 00:34:04,835
Was that real enough for you?

530
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:09,548
You kiss perfectly. It's what
I dreamed kissing would be like.

531
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,509
- Come away with me to Cairo.
- Cairo?

532
00:34:12,634 --> 00:34:17,389
We'll live in the desert. Oh, the blue-gold
light of sunset falling over your hair...

533
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:20,517
I'm sorry. I'm a little tipsy...
from the cham...

534
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,989
- Where's the fade-out?
- What?

535
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:38,410
When the kissing gets hot and heavy, just
before the lovemaking, there's a fade-out.

536
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:40,454
Oh, then what?

537
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:44,374
Then we're making love
in some private perfect place.

538
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:48,962
That's not how it happens here.

539
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,590
- What? There's no fade-out?
- No.

540
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:55,051
But when you kissed me,
I felt like my heart faded out.

541
00:34:55,177 --> 00:35:00,182
And I closed my eyes,
and I was in some private place.

542
00:35:01,183 --> 00:35:04,895
How fascinating.
You make love without fading out?

543
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,272
Yes...

544
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,483
Well, I can't wait to see this.

545
00:35:09,608 --> 00:35:12,402
Well... Listen, I...

546
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:17,157
I'm not that kind of girl. I'm married.

547
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,952
Cecilia...

548
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:24,498
it's clear how miserable
you are with your husband.

549
00:35:25,916 --> 00:35:29,669
And if he hits you again, you tell me.

550
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,880
I'd be forced to knock his teeth out.

551
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:35,342
I don't think that would be
such a good idea. He's big.

552
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:39,095
I'm sorry. It's written
into my character to do it, so I do it.

553
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,350
Listen, I think I'd better go home now.

554
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:46,937
It's late. It's been a whirlwind of a day,
don't you think?

555
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,523
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?

556
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:55,320
I'll just sleep here at the carousel,
and walk around, drink in the night air.

557
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,822
Enjoy my freedom...

558
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,950
and dream of you.

559
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,128
- You got in late last night.
- Oh, yeah. You were out like a light.

560
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,339
I took a hot bath to relax me.

561
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,842
- Wanna get me a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

562
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:20,637
There was some big deal
going on at the movie house.

563
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:23,223
- A crowd when I went to buy cigarettes.
- Yeah?

564
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:27,519
I couldn't get the story straight. Some guy
ran out the side exit with a customer.

565
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:30,605
- Who?
- A woman, a guy... An actor.

566
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,608
I don't know
what the cop was talking about.

567
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,152
Well, they don't know
who the woman was?

568
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,363
Some woman dragged out in the dark.

569
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:40,740
They got real Geronimos
at movie houses.

570
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,993
That's why
I don't like you staying out so late.

571
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:47,872
I know. I couldn't help it. The Lorenzos
didn't get back till late. I couldn't leave.

572
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,542
- I hope you got paid overtime.
- Sure.

573
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,752
Good, good. Let's have it.

574
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:57,507
Uh... They didn't have any cash.
I'll have to come back for it later today.

575
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,718
Cecilia, I told you to get paid in cash.

576
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:05,098
I know, but all they had was big bills
and I was getting late...

577
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,767
- They're gonna fork it over today?
- They will.

578
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:11,896
Sure. Leave something to you,
you can bet you're gonna get fouled up.

579
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:23,116
- You have no idea where he went?
<i>- Mr Hirsch, this is awful for us.</i>

580
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:26,286
<i>- Really difficult</i>
- Think of me. My reputation, my career.

581
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,414
- We've gotta keep it contained.
- The word's out already.

582
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,877
- We've gotta keep the crisis local.
- I know the reporters. I can talk to them.

583
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:37,756
Fine. Some bucks spread around town
will buy us some time. Don't worry.

584
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:40,133
<i>I mean, we're all so lost.</i>

585
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,969
I know it's rough.
I want the whole cast to know

586
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,972
how much I appreciate
your staying on the screen.

587
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,642
I hope you're not
gonna hold this against me, RH.

588
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:52,312
You created the part of Tom Baxter, Gil.
The facts are undeniable.

589
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,065
<i>I wanna go too.
I wanna be free. I want out.</i>

590
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:57,108
I'm warning you. That's communist talk.

591
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,987
We'll have to pull the film
and you'll have to make good my receipts.

592
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,157
<i>You're pulling a film
because a minor character is missing?</i>

593
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,159
A minor character? Listen to her.

594
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,996
You know, he may not have the most
lines, but the plot turns on Baxter.

595
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,957
I played him with a cheerful bravado.

596
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,335
<i>Who cares how you played him?
He's minor.</i>

597
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:18,713
I want to get my hands on him.
Right when my career was taking off.

598
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,882
<i>He could be raping
the woman he abducted.</i>

599
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,385
And he's got my exact fingerprints.

600
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:26,221
<i>You know what they get
for rape in a small town?</i>

601
00:38:26,346 --> 00:38:28,765
<i>Especially by a man in a pith helmet?</i>

602
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,393
If this is a new trend,
our industry's as good as dead.

603
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:35,355
The real ones want fictional lives,
the fictional ones want real lives.

604
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,776
- Anybody know who that woman was?
- No, it was all so crazy, nobody noticed.

605
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,737
Just two doughnuts
and a coffee to go, please.

606
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,532
(Gil) Right now, it's chaos.

607
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,661
How can rumours be circulating
at the Brown Derby? It just happened.

608
00:38:49,786 --> 00:38:53,206
Well, squash it, Herbie,
I got a career on the line.

609
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,334
Look, I'll call you the minute I hear.

610
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,047
- Oh, excuse me.
- What are you doing here?

611
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,591
I don't have a pencil
or I'd give you an autograph.

612
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:05,719
Where'd you get those clothes?

613
00:39:05,844 --> 00:39:08,555
- Pardon me?
- Your clothes. Where'd you get them?

614
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,557
Uh... A little store on Sunset and Vine.

615
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:13,727
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

616
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:18,565
- Excuse me.
- I just bought you these. Two doughnuts.

617
00:39:18,690 --> 00:39:22,652
For me? Well, thank you very much.
I hope you enjoy my next movie.

618
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:27,073
- You were gonna stay hidden at the park.
- What park?

619
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,743
Tom, what's the matter?
You're acting so peculiar.

620
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,036
Tom? No, no. I'm...

621
00:39:32,162 --> 00:39:37,083
- Wait a minute. Come here.
- What's come over you?

622
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,878
I'm not Tom.
I'm Gil Shepherd. I play Tom.

623
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,629
- What?
- How do you know Tom?

624
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:44,883
You're... Oh, my God! I don't believe it.

625
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:49,053
- Gil... I've seen you in lots of movies.
- Look, where's Tom?

626
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:52,390
- Oh. "Broadway Bachelors", right?
- Yeah, well... You know...

627
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,768
- "Honeymoon in Haiti"?
- I've done six.

628
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:58,480
- You were a scream.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

629
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:00,940
I try to do one a year,
you know, just to keep...

630
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,193
Where's Tom?

631
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,821
- Why?
- Well, he's my character. I created him.

632
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,115
Didn't the man
who wrote the movie do that?

633
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:13,828
Yes, technically.
But I made him live. I fleshed him out.

634
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:17,248
But you did a wonderful job.
He's adorable.

635
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,375
Thank you very much.

636
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,338
- What's your name?
- Cecilia.

637
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,132
Cecilia.

638
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,510
- Where is he?
- Why?

639
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,262
- Has he done anything wrong?
- Wrong? Like what?

640
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:34,891
Has he stolen anything
or attacked any females? You?

641
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:38,102
No. Gosh, no, no.
He's as sweet as can be.

642
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:42,065
- I played him sweet. I was well reviewed.
- Well, it comes across.

643
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,277
- Good. Look, I gotta speak to him.
- You're not upset with him?

644
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:50,365
Well, a little, yes. But if I spoke to him,
we could straighten everything out.

645
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:54,327
- Oh, I don't know.
- Please. I have a right.

646
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:58,832
Well, it has to be secret. He doesn't
wanna have to go back into the movie.

647
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,668
- He doesn't?
- No, he loves being free.

648
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,546
- He's having the time of his life.
- (Mutters) Oh, my God.

649
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:10,301
Would you take me to him?
Trust me. Please.

650
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:25,650
Monk, somebody saw your wife last night
at the Dine and Dance joint.

651
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,861
Oh, sure. She's there every night
with the Rockefellers.

652
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:32,657
She was with this crazy-looking guy
wearing an explorer's hat and breeches.

653
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,660
Breeches? You know, you're nuts.

654
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,789
- She was babysitting.
- Right. I guess you know it all.

655
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:47,171
All right. Who's next?

656
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,680
Tom?

657
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,766
Tom?

658
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:03,605
- Cecilia. I dreamed of us in Cairo...
- Tom.

659
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:06,399
- Tom, I brought Gil Shepherd.
- Gil Shepherd.

660
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,610
- I play you in the movie.
- You do?

661
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:12,614
- How dare you run away?
- This is disconcerting.

662
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:16,492
I'll show you the meaning of
disconcerting. I'm trying to build a career.

663
00:42:16,618 --> 00:42:20,121
I don't want to be in the film any more.
I'm in love with Cecilia.

664
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,833
- You said you weren't angry.
- You can't do this to me. It's my best role.

665
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:27,295
- I've been critically acclaimed.
- Because of the way I do it.

666
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:29,923
No, no. Because of the way I do it.
I'm doing it, not you.

667
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:34,928
- It's me, not him. Isn't that obvious?
- Well, how do you explain that here I am?

668
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:38,431
Well, because I took you
from the printed page and made you live.

669
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,726
- So I'm living.
- Yes, but for the screen only. Please...

670
00:42:41,851 --> 00:42:46,689
- I want my freedom.
- I don't want another me running around.

671
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:49,734
- Why? Are you afraid I'll embarrass you?
- Yes, frankly...

672
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:53,196
- But you created me.
- All right, look. Be reasonable here.

673
00:42:53,321 --> 00:42:57,241
I'm starting to build a career.
ls life up on the screen so terrible?

674
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:01,371
I want to be with Cecilia.
I'm in love with her.

675
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:04,415
Tell him to go back.
Tell him you don't love him.

676
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:08,920
You can't. He's fictional. You wanna
waste time with a fictional character?

677
00:43:09,045 --> 00:43:11,214
You're a sweet girl.
You deserve an actual human.

678
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,467
- But Tom's perfect.
- Yeah, but he's not real.

679
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,053
What good is perfect
if the man's not real?

680
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:23,142
I can learn to be real. There's nothing to it.
Being real comes very naturally to me.

681
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,437
You can't learn to be real.
It's like learning to be a midget.

682
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:30,942
- Some of us are real, some are not.
- I say I can do it.

683
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,820
I'm not gonna argue with you.
I'm going back to town.

684
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:37,365
I'm gonna call my attorney,
the actors' union.

685
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:41,452
I won't take this lying down.
Nor will Raoul Hirsch.

686
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:45,957
Nor the police, nor the FBI.

687
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:50,837
Yes. Yes, we found him.
Gil Shepherd found him.

688
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:55,341
But he refuses to get back
on the screen. RH is very upset.

689
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,803
No, no, we can't force him.
It's not a crime.

690
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:02,473
We need a plan.
Yeah, the press is on our side.

691
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,935
It took a few bucks, but they're
gonna keep it quiet for now.

692
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,311
What?

693
00:44:07,437 --> 00:44:09,772
Really?

694
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,442
The Tom Baxter character
in a movie house in Chicago

695
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,485
has been forgetting his lines.

696
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,612
We just got a call from the manager.

697
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:22,326
If anybody wants me, I'll be
in the bathroom, on the floor, weeping.

698
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:27,457
Aren't you at all even worried?

699
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,834
What about Raoul Hirsch and the FBI?

700
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:33,046
- If I can be with you, I'm never going back.
- But I...

701
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:37,008
No more buts. I said was gonna learn
about the real world with you. Show me.

702
00:45:20,635 --> 00:45:24,430
(Tom) It's beautiful.
But I'm not sure exactly what it is.

703
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:28,684
(Cecilia) Oh, this is a church.
You do believe in God, don't you?

704
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,561
(Tom) Meaning?

705
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:36,359
The reason for everything,
the world, the universe.

706
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:39,779
I think I know what you mean. The men
who wrote "The Purple Rose of Cairo".

707
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,865
Irving Sachs and RH Levine,
who collaborate on films.

708
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,160
No, I'm talking about
something much bigger than that.

709
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,789
No, think for a minute.
A reason for everything.

710
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:54,377
Otherwise, it'd be like a movie
with no point and no happy ending.

711
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:56,712
(Monk) So there you are.

712
00:45:56,838 --> 00:46:01,217
- I'm lookin' for you.
- Monk. I, erm...

713
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:05,263
This is my husband. This is Tom Baxter.

714
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:08,641
Explorer, the Chicago Baxters.
I'm charmed to meet you.

715
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,353
- So you wear the breeches.
- What do you want to talk to me about?

716
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,148
I heard you were out
on the town last night.

717
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,609
Yeah, I admit I didn't
tell the truth about that,

718
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,946
but things have been
so strange the last 24 hours...

719
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:24,448
I told you what I'd do to you
if you lied to me!

720
00:46:24,574 --> 00:46:28,327
- Your marriage has come to an impasse.
- And you keep outta this.

721
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,288
- Let's talk.
- No. You're coming home.

722
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:33,207
Perhaps you don't understand.
I'm in love with your wife.

723
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:36,127
Close your yap, jackass.
You're in for a lesson...

724
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,005
You're failing to understand.
She's not coming with you.

725
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,340
- She's not, huh?
- Take your hands off.

726
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:45,553
- No man'll hit the woman I love. Nor any...
- Beat it.

727
00:46:45,678 --> 00:46:48,264
- I'm gonna take you apart.
- Stop it. He's got a terrible temper.

728
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:51,893
- You, go home.
- It's written into my character. Courage.

729
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,644
Stop it.

730
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:04,155
- Come on.
- Stop it. What are you doing?

731
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,170
Time for the old one-two.

732
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,590
Up. I think he's had enough.

733
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:25,384
Sorry about the rough stuff. You all right?

734
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:29,055
- Yeah.
- Let me give you a hand. There's...

735
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,599
God, it's not fair.

736
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,189
Monk, what are you doing?

737
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,274
- You're comin' home with me now.
- No, I'm not.

738
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:43,444
- What did you say?
- I'm gonna stay and see that Tom's OK.

739
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:45,571
- You're a bully.
- I gave you an order.

740
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,658
I'm tired of your orders.
You could have killed him.

741
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:51,327
All right. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it. I hit hard.

742
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,372
You can't just go through life
beating people up.

743
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:56,624
I'm tellin' you one more time. You comin'?

744
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:59,168
No, I'm not.

745
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:02,004
- I'm tellin' you one more time. Comin'?
- No.

746
00:48:02,129 --> 00:48:04,131
- Come on.
- No, I'm not.

747
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:08,344
The hell with it. I need a beer anyway.

748
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,471
I'll see you later.

749
00:48:12,765 --> 00:48:17,186
- Oh, are you OK?
- Oh. Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

750
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:20,273
You're not even marked.
Your hair's in place.

751
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:22,942
No, no. I don't get hurt or bleed.
Hair doesn't muss.

752
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:25,987
It's one of the advantages
of being imaginary.

753
00:48:26,112 --> 00:48:28,906
- You were very brave.
- Well, I had him too,

754
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:30,908
till he started fighting dirty.

755
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,828
That's why you'll
never survive off the screen.

756
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,081
You were pretty brave, too.
You stood right up to him.

757
00:48:37,665 --> 00:48:40,209
You inspired me.

758
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,685
- (Cecilia) Mr Shepherd?
- Oh.

759
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:59,854
Cecilia, look, I gotta speak to you.

760
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:03,774
Oh, listen, I've had a crazy morning.
I'm still shaking.

761
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,402
I don't know what to do.
I've struggled my whole life.

762
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,740
Now I'm beginning to break through,
my whole career's going down the drain.

763
00:49:10,865 --> 00:49:16,037
You don't have to worry about that.
You'll always be a great movie star.

764
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:20,916
Oh, well, that's very nice of you.
But, technically, I'm not really a star yet.

765
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:24,837
Cecilia, don't... You know,
I mean, I try to carry myself like one.

766
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:27,923
You know, I do the best I can
as far as that, but "star"?

767
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:31,302
(Whistles)
That's a big word, isn't it? "Star"?

768
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:35,556
Yeah. Uh... No, no, no. Star? No. No.

769
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:39,769
And you're not just a pretty face,
you're also a peach of an actor.

770
00:49:39,894 --> 00:49:44,065
Really. I've seen you.
I've seen you a lot. You've got something.

771
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:48,069
- Is that your opinion?
- Sure, and I see all the movies.

772
00:49:48,194 --> 00:49:52,782
You've got... How can I describe it?

773
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,077
You've got a magical glow.

774
00:49:56,202 --> 00:49:58,412
Oh, boy. Oh, oh...

775
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:02,375
To hear that from a real person.
That is just...

776
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,170
It's not one of those Movie-Colony bimbos
filling you full of hot air.

777
00:50:06,295 --> 00:50:09,298
That's... Would you get
over here and sit down, please?

778
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:13,135
Well, you can take it from me.
You're not just a flash in the pan.

779
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,722
You know, it would be very easy for me
to trade on my looks. Just like that.

780
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:19,433
- Sure.
- I have serious acting ambitions.

781
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:24,897
You should. You should. You know, I think
you're great in all the funny movies.

782
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:26,315
Thank you.

783
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,860
I was thinking you should play
some of the more heroic parts.

784
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:33,531
- I tell my agent that a hundred times.
- Yeah? You know...

785
00:50:33,656 --> 00:50:39,245
You could play, like,
Daniel Boone or someone... Lindbergh.

786
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,957
- Oh, you'd be wonderful as Lindbergh.
- My God. You are a mind reader.

787
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:47,086
- We had the same thought? Really?
- I am on the verge of signing for that part.

788
00:50:47,211 --> 00:50:49,255
- No? Really?
- I am. I can taste it.

789
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,007
- Oh, you'll be wonderful.
- Thank you.

790
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:57,221
There's something inside you. You have
that same kind of lone heroic quality.

791
00:50:57,346 --> 00:51:00,266
You're exactly right.
Everyone has been telling me not to...

792
00:51:00,391 --> 00:51:03,686
- Don't you listen.
- I have been a loner my entire life.

793
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:08,816
Sure. Anyone can see that. You know,
you're deep, and probably complicated.

794
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,360
- Can I buy you lunch?
- Me?

795
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:14,738
- Please? I love talking to you.
- I was just gonna go upstairs.

796
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:16,615
- No, really. Come on.
- Really?

797
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,703
I open myself up around you like no...
Have you ever been to Hollywood?

798
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:24,498
- Come on, no. Of course not.
- I would love to take you to Hollywood.

799
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,042
I would... Can I make a confession?

800
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:29,879
- Sure.
- My real name, it's not Gil Shepherd.

801
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,131
It's Herman Bardebedian.

802
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:35,718
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been a cab driver for, oh...

803
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,637
- Boy, do you have a pretty face.
- Come on.

804
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,764
You do.

805
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,698
(Woman) Hi, big boy.

806
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:02,745
- You alone?
- Oh, hello.

807
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:07,249
Uh, well, I'm alone for now,
but later I have an appointment.

808
00:52:07,374 --> 00:52:09,793
Or should I say rendezvous?

809
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:14,173
Good for you.
Where'd you get the funny suit?

810
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,219
- What, this?
- Yeah.

811
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:22,473
- You coming from a costume party?
- (Laughs)

812
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:27,478
No. No, I'm Tom Baxter of the Chicago
Baxters. Explorer, poet, adventurer.

813
00:52:27,603 --> 00:52:32,024
Just back from Cairo, where I searched
in vain for the legendary purple rose.

814
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:36,320
- How about that?
- Well, who are you?

815
00:52:36,445 --> 00:52:38,906
- My name's Emma.
- Oh, that's lovely.

816
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:42,159
- What do you do, Emma?
- I'm a working girl.

817
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,495
And what do you do,
you delicate creature?

818
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:48,207
Anything that'll make a buck.

819
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:51,585
Well, we Baxters never
really had to worry about money.

820
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,339
I'll bet. You wanna come along with me?

821
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:58,551
- Where to, Emma?
- Where I work.

822
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,719
I think you might have a good time.

823
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:04,014
Sounds enchanting.
I'm up for new experiences.

824
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:06,850
I may be able to help.

825
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:11,772
- Hi, girls. This is Tom.
- Hi there, ladies.

826
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:15,109
- Don't you all look enticing?
- I know what you want.

827
00:53:15,234 --> 00:53:18,237
You wanna be the great white hunter
and you want me to be the tiger.

828
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,409
- I don't get it.
- You will if you can afford it.

829
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,538
- I met Tom out at the amusement park.
- Oh, no. That's my hat.

830
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:31,083
Uh, yes, I was thinking about something.

831
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:34,086
- I can imagine.
- Two of us at the same time?

832
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:36,213
I was thinking about deep things.

833
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,925
About God and his relation
with Irving Sachs and RH Levine.

834
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,930
I was thinking about life in general.
The origin of everything we see about us.

835
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:50,519
The finality of death and how almost
magical it seems in the real world,

836
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:54,189
as opposed to the world
of celluloid and flickering shadows.

837
00:53:54,315 --> 00:53:58,193
- Where did you find this clown?
- For example, the miracle of birth.

838
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,571
I suppose
some of you ladies are married, right?

839
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,990
- Not any more.
- No?

840
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:07,703
Then the absolutely
astonishing miracle of childbirth

841
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:11,332
with all its attendant feelings
of humanity and pathos.

842
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,460
- I stand in awe of existence.
- Do you wanna tie me up?

843
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,755
- Tie you up?
- Yeah.

844
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,050
Oh, that's very funny.

845
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:23,427
A nice sense of humour.
The absurd non sequitur.

846
00:54:23,552 --> 00:54:26,055
- What's your name, sweetheart?
- Martha.

847
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,307
That's the same
as the ambassador's wife.

848
00:54:28,432 --> 00:54:32,478
- Why didn't you bring the ambassador?
- Well, he's still up on the screen.

849
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:36,690
But do you share my sense of
wonderment at the very fabric of being?

850
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,986
The smell of a rose.
Real food. Sensuous music.

851
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:43,864
- I've got a child.
- You do?

852
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:46,825
Oh, I see. You're a widow. Oh, poor thing.

853
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:51,622
I got two kids and he's right about
giving birth. It is a beautiful experience.

854
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:55,793
I never had a baby.
I was pregnant, but I lost it.

855
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:59,797
- Sorry to hear that, Emma.
- It always makes me cry to think about it.

856
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:05,594
You'll get another chance. I'd be surprised
if all you ladies weren't married soon.

857
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,014
Especially by the way you dress.
It's so seductive to a man.

858
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,352
- Do you like these stockings, Tom?
- Oh, they're just divine.

859
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:17,189
What kind of a club is this, anyhow?

860
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,984
- God, Tom, you're a scream.
- He's terribly sweet.

861
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:24,321
He is. I wouldn't mind
doing him for nothing.

862
00:55:24,446 --> 00:55:27,491
- Me neither. Plus, he's cute.
- OK. You can count me in.

863
00:55:27,616 --> 00:55:32,287
We'll take you into the bedroom and give
you an experience you'll never forget.

864
00:55:32,413 --> 00:55:35,207
- And it's on us.
- I came here for a new experience.

865
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,043
Well, now you're gonna get
a champion roll in the hay.

866
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:42,756
- What? There's hay in the bedroom?
- You ever been to a brothel before?

867
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:45,968
- What's a brothel?
- You must be kidding.

868
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:50,514
- A brothel, a bordello, a whorehouse.
- I'm not following.

869
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:54,893
We go to bed with you,
and make love, and you pay us.

870
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,521
Only, because you're so sweet,
we want to treat you to a party.

871
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,401
Really?

872
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:06,363
Boy, this doesn't ring a bell
with anything I know.

873
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,907
Oh, come on, buddy.

874
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:13,287
- You know about making love, don't you?
- I can't make love with you.

875
00:56:13,412 --> 00:56:17,708
- Don't tell me you don't like women?
- Or you were wounded in the war?

876
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,668
No. I'm in love with someone else.

877
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,713
Not in love.
We're talking about making love.

878
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,175
- But I love Cecilia.
- Well, so what? Marry Cecilia.

879
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:29,720
- This is just for fun.
- I couldn't do that, Emma.

880
00:56:29,845 --> 00:56:32,014
Ladies, my gracious!

881
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:35,434
Don't think I'm not
appreciative of your offer.

882
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:37,936
I must say the concept
is totally new to me.

883
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:42,566
But I'm just... I'm hopelessly
head over heels in love with Cecilia.

884
00:56:42,691 --> 00:56:47,696
She is all I want.
My devotion is to her, my loyalties...

885
00:56:47,821 --> 00:56:51,033
Every breath she takes
makes my heart dance.

886
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:54,286
This guy just kills me.

887
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:57,039
Are there any other
guys like you out there?

888
00:56:58,290 --> 00:57:00,334
(Cecilia) Lawson's Music Store.

889
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:02,461
This store has been here
since I was a kid.

890
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:05,130
Mm. I wish I could play an instrument.

891
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:09,635
My other ambition in life
is to be a great classical violinist.

892
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,429
Thousands cheering me,
night after night...

893
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,389
- I can play the ukulele.
- You can?

894
00:57:14,515 --> 00:57:18,310
Uh-huh. My father taught me
before he ran away.

- I did one bit in one once. It's...
- I know. I saw "Dancing Doughboys".

924
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,533
"Dancing Doughboys". You remembered.

925
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,620
That was great.
You turned to Ina Beasley and said,

926
00:58:59,745 --> 00:59:02,164
"I won't be going south
with you this winter".

- Was it fun, kissing Ina Beasley?
- Oh, you know, it was a movie kiss.

937
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:39,201
We professionals
can put that stuff on just like that.

938
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:42,329
It looked like you loved her.

939
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:53,465
Oh, my goodness.

940
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,803
- Feel my heart.
- Oh, I...

941
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,306
I... I have to...
Thank you so much for the ukulele.

942
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:07,187
- Oh, don't be offended. I didn't mean...
- I'm not offended. I'm just confused.

943
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:12,067
I'm married. I just met a wonderful man.
Fictional, but you can't have everything.

944
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:16,196
- Look, can I see you later?
- No, no. I'm meeting Tom.

945
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:20,575
My own creation plagues me.

946
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:22,911
<i>- Anything happening out there?
- No.</i>

947
01:00:23,036 --> 01:00:24,621
<i>Life is amazing.</i>

948
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:29,251
<i>One minor character takes some action
and the world is turned upside down.</i>

949
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,961
(Countess)
'What if he never comes back?

950
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:32,963
<i>We just drift
until they shut the projector.</i>

951
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:36,550
<i>- Will you shut up?
- He'll be back. I feel it.</i>

952
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,177
<i>I don't wanna sit around.
That's what they want.</i>

953
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,471
<i>- Who?
- The bosses.</i>

954
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:46,101
<i>Look at us! Sitting around,
slaves to some stupid scenario.</i>

955
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:50,313
<i>Meanwhile, the fat cats in Hollywood
are getting rich on our work.</i>

956
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:53,025
<i>- Please, stop it
- Studio heads, writers, movie stars.</i>

957
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:56,069
<i>- Stop it
- But we're the ones who sweat.</i>

958
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:59,406
<i>- We're the characters on the screen
- You're a Red.</i>

959
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:02,868
<i>I say unite, brothers,
unite and take action.</i>

960
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:04,828
<i>- Shut up and sit down!
- What action?</i>

961
01:01:04,953 --> 01:01:07,706
<i>- You're working my last nerve
- Wait. Shut up.</i>

962
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:09,875
<i>What if all this is merely semantics?</i>

963
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,046
<i>- How can it be semantics?<i>
<i>- Well, let's just readjust our definitions.

964
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,256
<i>Let's redefine ourselves
as the real world,</i>

965
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,009
<i>and them as the world'
of illusion and shadow.</i>

966
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:22,137
<i>You see?
We're reality, they're a dream.</i>

967
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:26,933
<i>You'd better calm down. You've been
up on the screen flickering too long.</i>

968
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:32,481
- (Man 1) It's confirmed.
- (Man 2) I was afraid this'd happen.

969
01:01:32,606 --> 01:01:37,360
Tom Baxter tried to leave the screen
in St Louis, Chicago, Denver, and Detroit.

970
01:01:37,486 --> 01:01:39,988
- And he almost made it in Detroit.
- It looks bad.

971
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:42,657
The movie houses in those towns
are in pandemonium.

972
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,994
- There's no way to keep the lid on it.
- I see hundreds of lawsuits.

973
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:48,997
- Let's pull the picture outta release.
- In those towns?

974
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:52,250
No, everywhere. Something's
obviously gone very wrong here.

975
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:56,338
The best course of action
is to shut down, take our losses,

976
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,341
and get outta this mess
before it really gets out of hand.

977
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:02,427
Can you imagine hundreds
of Baxters flying around wild?

978
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:05,263
Right. And you responsible
for every one of them?

979
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,642
The best thing to do is to quit
while there's only one out there.

980
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,686
- What do we do about him?
- We get him back in the picture.

981
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:14,523
Then we turn off the projector
and burn the prints.

982
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:18,777
- And the negative.
- Shame. It was such a good picture.

983
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:23,824
- I missed you. You're late.
- I'm sorry. I came as quickly as I could.

984
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:27,244
- I love you.
- Oh, thank you.

985
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:30,705
Tom... My feelings are so jumbled.

986
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:34,459
I know. You're married and you're
old-fashioned and I'm a whole new idea.

987
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,129
But the truth is you're unhappily married.

988
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:41,258
- I'm gonna take you away from all this.
- Yeah. I... I know you love me.

989
01:02:41,383 --> 01:02:44,052
Cecilia, I do love you.
Don't you share my feelings?

990
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:49,349
Well, that's just it.
You're some kind of phantom.

991
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:53,436
Look, I don't wanna talk any more
about what's real and what's illusion.

992
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:57,357
Life's too short to spend time
thinking about life. Let's just live it.

993
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,235
- Live it how?
- Well, we'll begin with dinner.

994
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:04,156
- Listen, I've only got a few dollars.
- We're not gonna use your money.

995
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,117
That's all we have.
Unless you've done something?

996
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:10,954
Well, the moon'll be full, the stars'll
be out, and we're going stepping.

997
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:14,040
- But we're broke.
- Leave that to me.

998
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:44,905
<i>- It's him! Tom, you're back</i>
- I want you to meet my fiancée, Cecilia.

999
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:46,907
- (Cecilia) Tom...
- This... Well, you know them.

1000
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:50,327
<i>- It's not possible</i>
- I'm in the world of the possible.

1001
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:53,538
<i>Yeah? Well, you'd better get
back in the story, you weasel.</i>

1002
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:57,250
Ah. You anticipate me.

1003
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,211

1005
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,634
<i>- Oh! Where am I?
- But she can't be in here.</i>

1006
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:08,845
<i>- Why not? My money's good up here
- I feel so light.</i>

1007
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:11,765
<i>- Like I'm floating on air
- It upsets the balance.</i>

1008
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:14,392
<i>- So what? He's back, isn't he?
- I told you he'd be back.</i>

1009
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,979
<i>- Can we get on with the plot now?
- How can we with her here?</i>

1010
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:21,566
<i>She's here with me and I'll sock any man
who makes her feel unwanted.</i>

1011
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:23,944

1012
01:04:24,069 --> 01:04:26,947

What are you doing here?

<i>I took her on a date. All right?
Now, can't you just leave us alone?</i>

<i>Oh, for God's sake, would you
go back to Hollywood? Please.</i>

1074
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:37,966
I'm embarrassed to admit it, Cecilia.

1075
01:09:38,091 --> 01:09:40,552
You know you said I had a magical glow?

1076
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:43,721
It's you. You're the one that has one.

1077
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:47,976
And even though we've just met,
I know that this is the real thing.

1078
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,478
You can't be in love with Cecilia.
She's in love with me.

1079
01:09:50,603 --> 01:09:54,607
- Why don't you re-enter the film?
- I'm never going back.

See, Tom? You're ruining everything.

- You're ruining everything.
- Without me, there would be no you.

01:10:04,284 --> 01:10:07,495
I could have been played
by Fredric March or Leslie Howard.

<i>You're wrong. The part's
too insignificant to attract a major star.</i>

1085

- Insignificant?
- Like hell! What are you talking about?

1086
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,922
- What do you mean?
- I am not a minor character.

1087
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:22,051
I haven't been able to think of anything
since we met. I have to have some time

1088
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:26,598
to show you what real life can be like
if two people really care for each other.

1089
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:31,728
Last week I was unloved.
Now two people love me,

1090
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,188
and it's the same two people.

1091
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:38,401
<i>- Go with the real guy. We're limited.
- Go with Tom. He's got no flaws.</i>

1092
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:41,154
<i>Go with somebody, child,
cos I's gettin' bored.</i>

1093
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:43,823
She'll marry me.
You're wasting your time.

1094
01:10:43,948 --> 01:10:48,244
Will you get back on the screen? I'm
trying to tell Cecilia I'm in love with her.

1095
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:53,708
I love you. I'm honest, dependable,
courageous, romantic, and a great kisser.

1096
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,628
- And I'm real.
- (Larry)<i> Let's go, Cecilia.</i>

1097
01:10:56,753 --> 01:10:59,047
<i>Choose one of them,
so we can settle this thing.</i>

1098
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:02,342
<i>The most human of attributes
is your ability to choose.</i>

1099
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:06,220
<i>Wait a minute. If she chooses Tom,
how are we gonna end the story?</i>

1100
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:10,391
<i>- We'll be stuck here for ever</i>
- Father Donnelly can marry us right here.

1101
01:11:10,516 --> 01:11:13,102
That won't stand up.
The priest has to be human.

1102
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:15,688
<i>The Bible never says
a priest can't be on film.</i>

1103
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:19,942
- No, I'm already married.
- Come away with me to Hollywood.

1104
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:22,445
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1105
01:11:22,570 --> 01:11:24,947
Do something impulsive
for once in your life.

1106
01:11:25,073 --> 01:11:28,868
Just throw your stuff in a valise
and come away with me. Really.

1107
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:32,163
- And don't forget that ukulele.
- What ukulele?

1108
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:38,294
Look, I love you. I know
that only happens in movies, but I do.

1109
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:44,425
Tom...

1110
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:50,306
<i>- You're throwing away perfection
- Don't tell her that. We need Tom back.</i>

1111
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,142
<i>- It's so romantic.
- Oh, women.</i>

1112
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,315
Well, I'm... I'm crushed. I'm devastated.

1113
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,153
Tom, try to understand.

1114
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:10,034
You'll be fine. In your world, things
have a way of always working out right.

1115
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:16,791
I'm a real person. No matter how tempted
I am, I have to choose the real world.

1116
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:20,628
I loved every minute with you.

1117
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:24,549
And I'll never forget our night on the town.

1118
01:12:28,302 --> 01:12:29,929
Good bye.

1119
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:45,153
(Larry)<i> You're better off with us,
old sport. You really are.</i>

1120
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:47,280
(Jason)<i> Can we get on with
"The Purple Rose of Cairo?</i>

1121
01:12:47,405 --> 01:12:49,782
(Delilah) <i>If anyone wants me, I'll be in reel six.</i>

1122
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:54,454
<i>- Kitty's waiting for you
- Lord have mercy. What a day.</i>

1123
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:56,789
<i>What a day.</i>

1124
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:30,114
Your explorer friend's OK?
I saw him walking around town with you.

1125
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:33,326
Yeah, he's OK. No thanks to you.

1126
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,329
I didn't mean to be so rough on him.
I get jealous over you.

1127
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:39,165
- Do you?
- Christ, you know I do.

1128
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:42,293
I know I treat you rough. It's my way.
It doesn't mean I don't feel for you.

1129
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:47,381
- What are you doin'?
- Leaving.

1130
01:13:47,507 --> 01:13:49,759
- Here we go again.
- You don't feel for me.

1131
01:13:49,884 --> 01:13:55,014
All you feel for is yourself.
Your beer, your card games, your women.

1132
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:59,811
- OK. I'm gonna turn over a new leaf.
- It's too late, Monk. Too late. I'm going.

1133
01:13:59,936 --> 01:14:04,232
I shoulda left a long time ago. I would've,
except I was scared of being alone.

1134
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:07,652
So what now? Some chump's
fillin' your head with big ideas?

1135
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:11,739
No, no. I got a chance to change my life.
I'm moving to Hollywood.

1136
01:14:11,864 --> 01:14:15,993
Listen. I said I was sorry about being
rough with your friend. Let's shape up.

1137
01:14:16,118 --> 01:14:19,455
- It's too late. Monk.
- Like hell it is. I said, like hell it is.

1138
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:23,459
Don't give me that big-headed stuff.
I'm the guy that can slap you down.

1139
01:14:23,584 --> 01:14:27,588
Go ahead and hit me, Monk. Go ahead
and hit me. I'm leaving anyway.

1140
01:14:27,713 --> 01:14:30,174
This never woulda happened
if you didn't meet that guy.

1141
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:32,593
And we woulda just gone on the same way

1142
01:14:32,718 --> 01:14:35,054
till we were too old
to even hope for better.

1143
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:40,226
But I did meet him. I did meet him, and
I have feelings for him, and he has for me.

1144
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:45,064
- What about me?
- I still care for you, believe it or not.

1145
01:14:45,189 --> 01:14:48,985
But out of the blue, for the first time
in my life, somebody's in love with me.

1146
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:51,445
No, but... but you just met each other.

1147
01:14:51,571 --> 01:14:55,241
Love at first sight
doesn't only happen just in the movies.

1148
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:58,536
Cecilia, don't go. You hear me?
I said don't go. Now, wait a minute.

1149
01:14:58,661 --> 01:15:01,873
- I said don't go. You stay here!
- So long, Monk.

1150
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:05,751
- You take care of yourself.
- Oh, yeah? All right, well, go. Go.

1151
01:15:05,877 --> 01:15:09,297
See if I care. Go, see what it is out there.
It ain't the movies.

1152
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:12,758
It's real life.
It's real life, and you'll be back.

1153
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:16,095
You mark my words. You'll be back.

1154
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:44,624
- Cecilia, what are you doing?
- Meeting Gil Shepherd.

1155
01:15:44,749 --> 01:15:49,211
- They all gone.
- They... What do you mean?

1156
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:52,965
- They went back to Hollywood.
- Gil, too?

1157
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:58,095
Mr Shepherd, yeah. As soon as Baxter
went back up on the movie screen

1158
01:15:58,220 --> 01:15:59,889
he couldn't wait to get outta here.

1159
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:03,351
He said this was
a close call for his career.

1160
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:06,479
I think he's gonna play Charles Lindbergh.

1161
01:16:13,778 --> 01:16:18,199
Don't forget, Cecilia. Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers start today.
