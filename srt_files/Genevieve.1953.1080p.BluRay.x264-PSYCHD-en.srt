1
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,322
Sorry, sir!

2
00:01:54,375 --> 00:01:56,331
- Is this the weekend, McKim?
' Yes, Sir-

3
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:57,706
- Good luck.
- Thank you, Sir.

4
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,077
- Sorry.
- Come on!

5
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,330
FEM

6
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:10,990
Shove this into my locker,
will you?

7
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:13,784
- What's the big rush?
- Taking Genevieve to Brighton.

8
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:14,993
Good luck.

9
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,740
- Hi-
- Hello there.

10
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:18,910
Wendy!

11
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,493
Wendy!

12
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,364
Wendy!

13
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,535
=1 F131

14
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,157
It's not locked, you know.

15
00:04:12,417 --> 00:04:13,782
You shouldn't carry so much.

16
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:16,657
You made me break the eggs,
-That's what!

17
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:37,660
What's the matter?

18
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,040
Teamers have ruined my best skirt.

19
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:42,748
Yes, they pressed the pleats
the wrong way around.

20
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,703
How can you tell which way
a pleat should go?

21
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,661
- Alan!
- Yeah?

22
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,448
Proper lunch or proper dinner?

23
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,160
Proper dinner.

24
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,198
- Eh-
- Oh!

25
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,947
Are we doing anything this afternoon?
Yes, I am. Tinkering.

26
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,163
Genevieve's making strange noises.
Never makes anything else.

27
00:05:08,917 --> 00:05:10,077
The bank.

28
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:13,367
We seem to be worth 133
pounds and nine pence.

29
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:15,118
Should be 1 43.

30
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,498
I drew out ten.
What for?

31
00:05:16,542 --> 00:05:18,908
A surprise.
What kind of a...?

32
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:43,114
Hello, sport.

33
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,740
Give ear to that, will ya?

34
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:47,199
Very nice.
Nice? It's like a jet!

35
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:49,206
I just spent 25 quid
having her tuned up.

36
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:51,248
How are you, old boy?
Fine thanks.

37
00:05:51,292 --> 00:05:52,498
And the beautiful Mrs. McKim?

38
00:05:52,542 --> 00:05:54,624
She's in, I hope.
Wendy's in the kitchen.

39
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:59,741
How about this old crop?
Think she'll make it to Brighton?

40
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:02,329
Well, if she doesn't.
You'll have to take a train.

41
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,785
I'm giving a party
tomorrow night.

42
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:07,041
Just you, Wendy, Rosalind
and myself.

43
00:06:07,542 --> 00:06:09,999
Who's Rosalind?
A woman I met at the races.

44
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:12,408
I use the term woman
in it's broadest sense.

45
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,114
I'll bet you do.

46
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:19,582
From the east to western end,
no jewel is like Rosalind!

47
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:22,283
She's equally keen on you.
Of course.

48
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,789
Keen? She's positively itching.

49
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,282
Lunch in 10 minutes.

50
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,288
Hello, Ambrose.

51
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:30,831
Hello, you georgeous creature.

52
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:33,039
Come on, let's live a little!

53
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,749
Kettle's boiling.
Ah, so am i.

54
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:39,158
You look wonderful today.
I'll come in and help you.

55
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,790
Why don't you flunk that wreck,
and buy a Spyker?

56
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,538
Silly ass.

57
00:06:47,917 --> 00:06:49,953
Oh, I say. That smells delicious.

58
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:53,204
Wasn't very much.
Well, you know me.

59
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,414
Any sherry?
Help yourself.

60
00:06:56,042 --> 00:06:58,249
How's the advertising business?
Ah, tedious.

61
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,372
1111' mm

62
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,248
You have one, Wendy?
Thanks.

63
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,365
Who's the lucky girl this year?

64
00:07:03,417 --> 00:07:05,203
One Rosalind Peters.
She's a model.

65
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:07,035
What does she model?
Well...

66
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,493
No, don't tell me.
I can guess.

67
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:11,249
She says they're wearing
the same thing in sweaters this year.

68
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,581
She seems very interested
in vintage cars.

69
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,332
Wait until she's bounced all
the way to Brighton and back.

70
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,040
My spyker doesn't bounce.
It flows.

71
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:23,749
You don't seem very excited
about the rally, if I may say so.

72
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,289
Not exactly beside myself.

73
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,454
If I didn't know you better
I'd say your enthusiasm is on the wane.

74
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,749
Oh Ambrose the whole thing's so silly.

75
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:35,249
Oh steady-On girl,
the Londo
-Brighton silly?

76
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:36,953
Well it tis. It's childish and a bore.

77
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,660
Does Alan know you
feel like that about it?

78
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,744
Of course not.
I couldn't possibly tell him.

79
00:07:41,042 --> 00:07:42,373
Couldn't possibly tell me what?

80
00:07:42,958 --> 00:07:44,323
Nothing.

81
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,990
Well, tell me.
No, it's nothing.

82
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,948
Ambrose is stayiing to lunch.

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,410
Brown or white?

84
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,447
What couldn't you possibly tell me?

85
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,082
The fact is old boy, there's
a spot of treachery in our midst.

86
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:54,581
- Wendy says...
Ambrose!

87
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:56,081
Wendy says the London
-Brighton is a bore.

88
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:57,785
Ambrose, I could

89
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,949
Does than mean
you don't want to go?

90
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:02,747
No, of course I'll go.

91
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:04,908
You don't have to go you
know if you don't want to.

92
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,243
I don't?

93
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,915
Well, frankly children
this is beyond me.

94
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:10,948
Is there something
you'd rather do instead?

95
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,288
Well, is there?

96
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,706
Now just remember will you

97
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,287
I didn't bring this up, and
i didn't want to talk about it.

98
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:24,369
But, as it happens, Tania's
having a party tomorrow.

99
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,328
I'm having a party too
you, Alan and...

100
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:29,412
The one weekend in the year that
you know is important to me

101
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:30,413
And you'd rather go to a...

102
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,957
Of course I'd rather go to a party.
Does that make me abnormal or something?

103
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:36,830
I simply don't see what's so wonderful
about getting into a 50-year-old car and

104
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,991
Taking two days to drive to
Brighton and back.

105
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:51,624
Right. I was about to plead
a subsequent engagement.

106
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:53,865
Well, good luck sport.

107
00:09:01,042 --> 00:09:02,248
I'm sorry, darling.

108
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,535
Of course I'll go.

109
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,533
Perhaps it'll be better this year.
No!

110
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,456
No what?
I'll make the run alone.

111
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:12,456
Oh, please!

112
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,661
If you're going to be moody
and long-suffering about it.

113
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,824
I? I moody and long-suffering.

114
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:17,955
Don't you think you're
being a little unfair?

115
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,367
No I don't. I think you're unfair.

116
00:09:21,417 --> 00:09:23,499
If Ambrose hadn't come in.
Ambrose! Ambrose!

117
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,032
Let's leave him out of it.

118
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:28,405
That's the really unpleasant aspect about this situation.
The fact that you talked to him...

119
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,621
Why shouldn't I talk to him.
He's our oldest friend isn't he?

120
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,702
He even introduced us.

121
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,708
I'd like to feel that when you had
a problem, you could discuss it with me.

122
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:39,333
I don't understand your eagerness
to confide in abrose claverhouse.

123
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,036
That's a beastly thing to say!

124
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:44,621
All right, then, so I'm unfair,
moody, long-suffering and beastly!

125
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,864
You know very well you were going
to ask me to give up the run and
take you to the party instead.

126
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,037
You would have asked me tonight.
I'm not going with you

127
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,165
This year, next year
or any year!

128
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:55,494
I'll never get into
that silly car again!

129
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:58,616
Your lunch is ready.
I don't want any lunch!

130
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:00,828
Then don't eat any lunch.
I can get it round to the pub!

131
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,866
Then go round to the blasted pub.

132
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:13,909
Why shouldn't I talk to him.
He's the oldest...

133
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,618
Wendy!

134
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,368
Wendy!

135
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:45,783
Wendy, come and eat your lunch.
Oh, go away.

136
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:18,121
What on earth are you doing now?
- Cleaning my teeth.

137
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,870
Glass under the bathtub.
I knocked it out of the window.

138
00:11:38,083 --> 00:11:40,574
Why sweep it under the tub?
I'll only have to get it out again.

139
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,661
Well don't worry about it.
I'll clean it up in the morning.

140
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,241
-What on earth are you looking for?
-A bandage.

141
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,873
Why? Hurt yourself?

142
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,031
Oh. You'll survive.

143
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:54,041
It's bleeding. If no objection
I'd like to have a bandage.

144
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,535
Don't know where they are.

145
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,789
They're in a book somewhere.

146
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,373
Do you think you'll
be able to drive?

147
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,243
It doesn't matter,
I'm not going.

148
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,490
What on earth do you mean,
not going?

149
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:12,242
Oh, Alan, do stop behaving..
There're no bandages in there?

150
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,831
They must be downstairs.

151
00:12:16,042 --> 00:12:19,114
If you think you can punish me by not
going, you've got another think coming.

152
00:12:19,417 --> 00:12:21,453
I don't care one little bit
whether you go or not.

153
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,788
And if you're not going. Why did you spend
the whole afternoon working on the car?

154
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:29,781
Oh, men!

155
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,456
Spend the whole afternoon working on the car.

156
00:12:35,917 --> 00:12:38,659
For a matter that's important to me,
we're always equal.

157
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,656
Alan...

158
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:46,911
I've got grease on my face.

159
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:49,369
Dont you mind my bonnet?

160
00:13:50,542 --> 00:13:53,409
What is taking place here is
by now an old story

161
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,701
But suprising as it may seem
it was quite illegal until 1896.

162
00:13:58,417 --> 00:14:01,705
Until then no self-propelled
vehicle could take the road

163
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,287
Unless it was preceded
by a man on foot

164
00:14:04,333 --> 00:14:06,369
And carrying a red flag.

165
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,498
There were very few
cars on the roads

166
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:12,239
And very few roads, for that
matter, merely stretches of dust.

167
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,741
There were no garages
or service stations.

168
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:17,995
And the pioneer motorist bought
his petrol from the chemist.

169
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,992
But in that year was passed the
light locomotives and highways act.

170
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:25,333
To celebrate the event the first
car so emancipated started

171
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,491
From the metropole
hotel, London

172
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,249
And drove to the metropole
hotel, Brighton

173
00:14:32,167 --> 00:14:35,284
Since 1928 the Veteran Car
Club has held an

174
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,244
Annual commemoration run.

175
00:14:37,292 --> 00:14:39,749
But it is not, and has
never been, a race.

176
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:41,703
Here's a very handsome machine.

177
00:14:42,292 --> 00:14:44,578
A Darracq, isn't it?
Yes, that's right.

178
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,573
1 904, isn't it?

179
00:14:49,792 --> 00:14:51,282
Yes, that's right.
Yes, I thought so.

180
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:55,743
Well I wonder whether you'd
care tell listeners how it
was that you came to acquire

181
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,202
This, uh, vehicle Mr....

182
00:14:57,792 --> 00:14:58,702
Uh McKim.
McKim, yes.

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,663
My grandfather bought her new.
In about, uh, 1928 my uh...

184
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,866
My my my father found
her on a rubbish dump

185
00:15:07,917 --> 00:15:09,828
Bought it for a pound
and rebuilt her. Um.

186
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:13,074
He's made all the runs..
I made all the..

187
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,242
He made all the runs before the
war, and I've made them all since.

188
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,954
That's astonishing. Thank you both
very much. And jolly good luck to you.

189
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,614
WI m

190
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,240
I wonder where Ambrose is?

191
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,452
You see Mr. Claverhouse?

192
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,991
He's gone to telephone.
His guest failed to appear.

193
00:15:28,042 --> 00:15:29,452
He's due to start in five minutes.

194
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,207
Suppose after all that
buildup he's isn't even going
to produce her. Ho ho ho...

195
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:33,205
mm

196
00:15:38,708 --> 00:15:41,450
Do you think thats...? It must be.
It couldn't be anyone else.

197
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,786
I beg your pardon.
Are you miss Peters?

198
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,995
Yes, you must be Mr. And Mrs...
McKim, Alan and Wendy.

199
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:52,623
Ah, Ambrose's friends.

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,457
Isn't he here? - I think he
went to telephone. - Oh.

201
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:56,910
He'll be back.

202
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,453
I, I'll take your cases
over to his car. Thank you.

203
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,906
Suzy!

204
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:02,869
Come on, Suzy.

205
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:04,202
Come on.

206
00:16:04,875 --> 00:16:05,864
um

207
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,624
This is Suzy. She
can say, how d'you do.

208
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:13,077
Say, how d'you do, Suzy.

209
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:17,873
Say, how d'you do, Suzy. Oh.

210
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,744
She can do the cutest things
when she wants to.

211
00:16:22,792 --> 00:16:24,783
It must be too
early in the morning.

212
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:29,374
Didn't realize it's going
to be so many people.

213
00:16:30,042 --> 00:16:32,499
Ambrose said it's a
very exclusive club.

214
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:33,497
Suzy!

215
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,415
I usually leave her with
the housekeeper where I live.

216
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,869
But she's been ill,
so I had to bring her.

217
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:41,374
You don't think that Ambrose'l
mind, do you? Mind?

218
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,911
Of course not.
He'll be delighted.

219
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:45,368
Here we are.

220
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,698
Is that it?
This is it.

221
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:50,745
Oh, no!
Is this Ambrose's?

222
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,082
But has it got brakes and everything?
I know he said it was an old car,

223
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:58,160
but the way he talked about it I thought
it was something wonderful!

224
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,540
You'll get used to it.
They all talk like that.

225
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:01,413
\zcmrrmu

226
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:04,123
Hey, Rosalind!

227
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,740
Good morning, Wendy.
Morning, old sport.

228
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,828
So reason prevailed, eh?

229
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:14,288
Thank heavens you got here. I've
been calling your number all night.

230
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,450
Oh I'm sorry, but I went to that party
on friday, and it sort of got out of hand.

231
00:17:17,667 --> 00:17:20,124
Everybody decided to fly to
jersey. Eh?

232
00:17:20,792 --> 00:17:22,032
Aw. Oh well, never mind.

233
00:17:26,417 --> 00:17:27,497
kllllilK-':Iltlh‘

234
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:32,409
I was going to Ieaver her with the
housekeeper, but she's been sick.

235
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:35,655
The dog's been sick? No, of
course not. The housekeeper.

236
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,741
But Rosalind. We can't take that
mutt all the way to Brighton.

237
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,077
She's not a mutt.

238
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,411
She's a sweet dog and has
absolutely perfect manners.

239
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,280
Can't you understand? We can't
take that great big fat, lump of a...

240
00:17:47,042 --> 00:17:49,374
Alan, bear me out.
It just won't do, will it?

241
00:17:49,417 --> 00:17:53,080
Well, I don't see why not, old man.
Oh fine, fine that's very funny.

242
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,160
Mr. Claverhouse.

243
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,203
Mr. Olaverhouse.
You're next.

244
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,911
All right. But we'd
better get aboard.

245
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,780
Will the cars on the eastern side....
Rosalind in fact hurry up!

246
00:18:03,042 --> 00:18:06,159
All the cars on the eastern
side are first.

247
00:18:07,292 --> 00:18:09,328
You'll find it'll be all
right, once you get started.

248
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:11,036
You're a great help.
You are.

249
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,331
Suzy's itching, anyway.
Bah!

250
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:18,409
See you in Brighton. Goodbye.
Bye, Wendy!

251
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,289
Goodbye!

252
00:18:20,792 --> 00:18:21,952
Goodbye!

253
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,618
Goodbye!

254
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,332
No standards.
Nobody home.

255
00:18:54,792 --> 00:18:55,872
Happy, darling?

256
00:18:57,917 --> 00:18:59,908
I know I was a silly
ass, yesterday.

257
00:19:00,583 --> 00:19:02,414
It just wouldn't be
the same without you.

258
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,616
I love you.
You know that?

259
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,119
And I love you, too. And
I'm glad I came. Really.

260
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:24,998
Oh, blast these
tram lines!

261
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:28,291
You know. I think she's
feeling better now.

262
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,414
I think she's even
beginning to like it.

263
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,831
Aren't you Suzy?
But where did you get her?

264
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,411
I found her.
During the war.

265
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,745
I think she was blitzed,
because she was awfully neurotic.

266
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,656
Do you know

267
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:41,700
For a long time she wouldn't
eat anything except ravioli.

268
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,990
Isn't that strange!

269
00:20:05,542 --> 00:20:07,954
Not too cold, are you
darling? No, I'm fine.

270
00:20:08,958 --> 00:20:10,323
I don't think it'll
rain, anyway.

271
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:14,908
I must say. Considering how
little time I had to work on her

272
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:16,164
The old girl's
really behaving herself.

273
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,119
You should never
say a thing like that.

274
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,619
Nothing important.
It won't take a minute.

275
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:27,157
Want some coffee?
No thanks. Not now.

276
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,665
Having trouble?
We shall be all right, thank you.

277
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,869
All right for petrol?
Yes, quite.

278
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:38,407
Better try a new fling.

279
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,616
Modern car owner
for you. Typical.

280
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,198
I thought that
was very funny!

281
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:51,829
Didn't you think it was
funny? No I didn't.

282
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:56,823
Oh, darling, it's not even 10:30.
What do you mean?

283
00:20:57,292 --> 00:20:59,283
You can't lose your temper now.

284
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,575
If you lose your temper now. What on
earth are you going to be like by evening.

285
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,115
Wendy!

286
00:21:05,167 --> 00:21:07,658
Oh, my golly.
It's all gone through my skirt!

287
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,119
Do something!
Why don't you do something!

288
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,740
Give me a towel. Quick.
Here's another one?

289
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,202
Stop beside him.

290
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,411
Hurry up!
Hurry up!

291
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,369
Oh, I'll have to change
absolutely everything.

292
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:19,578
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Darling.

293
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,913
Oh, you are clumsy.
It's all your fault.

294
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,539
Why couldn't you be
more careful?

295
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:27,824
It's ruined the dress.
Wendy I'm terribly sorry.

296
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,615
I didn't know you were
pouring the coffee.

297
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,407
Otherwise I wouldn't of
threatend to start her. Alan

298
00:21:35,958 --> 00:21:36,822
Darling.

299
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,118
Now look here my friend.
We don't want any...

300
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,823
Very nice.
Thank you very much.

301
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:51,907
:mnmlm

302
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:54,704
What's the matter, chum? Don't you
want to see yourself on the film?

303
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,866
Take your Mrs. To the local.
She'll love it.

304
00:22:10,667 --> 00:22:12,953
Wendy. Are you all right?

305
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,373
Yes, I'm fine.

306
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,410
Darling, I'm terribly sorry.

307
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,910
Are you soaking?

308
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,949
Is there anything I can do?
Yes.

309
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,413
Put these in the car.

310
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:28,282
Here, and this too.

311
00:22:31,542 --> 00:22:33,248
Hello, McKim.
Hello love.

312
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:09,245
I'm sorry, darling.
It was my fault, the whole thing.

313
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:11,499
Never mind. It's not
as bad as all that.

314
00:23:11,542 --> 00:23:12,657
Come on. Let's go.

315
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,533
You know I wouldn't blame you,
if you said you wanted to turn back.

316
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,739
Well I don't.

317
00:23:22,292 --> 00:23:24,749
Are you sure?
Are you sure you're not just saying that.

318
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:29,034
Look, I don't want you to go on with
this just because you think I'd be hurt.

319
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:30,823
I'm perfectly willing
to go home.

320
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,618
I mean it.

321
00:23:33,167 --> 00:23:36,125
We'd get back in time for Tania's
party. Oh, come off it, Alan.

322
00:23:36,167 --> 00:23:38,283
But I mean it.
You don't mean it a'tall.

323
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:41,454
You know as well as I do we shall be
in Brighton tonight dead or alive.

324
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:45,489
But you want to go on?
I've said I want to go on.

325
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,662
I know, but if you did want
to go home. All right.

326
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,285
All right, what?

327
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:57,828
Let's go home. Uh?

328
00:23:58,417 --> 00:23:59,657
I want to go home.

329
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:03,499
Do you mean it?
Of course I mean it!

330
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,537
Darling, you are serious, aren't you?
You're not just.. Oh, for heaven's sake, Alan

331
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:12,323
You know perfectly well
we're going to Brighton.

332
00:24:12,375 --> 00:24:14,036
Are we gonna sit here
all day?

333
00:24:31,458 --> 00:24:34,370
Do you realize what good
time we've made. I told you...

334
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,908
I know, I shouldn't say things like
that. But the fact is, we've had.

335
00:24:38,292 --> 00:24:39,498
I've just had an idea.
Mmm.

336
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:42,698
Don't you want to know
what it tis?

337
00:24:43,417 --> 00:24:45,282
You should do, because
you're going to be delighted.

338
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,415
All right. Delight me.
- Look old harry's pub is only half a mile

339
00:24:48,625 --> 00:24:52,618
ahead. We're going to stop and I'm
going to buy you a jolly good lunch.

340
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,537
You know what? I'm going to
buy you a jolly good dinner.

341
00:25:10,792 --> 00:25:12,373
I'm not counting on that, either.

342
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:15,953
It'll take at least a half
an hour to put this right.

343
00:25:16,292 --> 00:25:18,578
You know, I really did want
to buy you a decent lunch, but..

344
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,365
What are you looking for?

345
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:24,656
kllllilK‘IIIEh‘

346
00:25:25,458 --> 00:25:26,618
Food!
Yes.

347
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:28,623
But how? Wh.. Wh..When?
Last night?

348
00:25:28,667 --> 00:25:30,623
Last night.
While you were asleep.

349
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:34,159
I knew we wouldn't get any lunch. Never have
done yet, when we went to Brighton.

350
00:25:34,542 --> 00:25:37,033
Chicken, ham, salad

351
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:38,952
r
L.) I K 1‘1.

352
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,159
Oh, you're wonderful!

353
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,956
It's a wonderful idea.
Makes the day.

354
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,077
Look, there they are.

355
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,124
Having some difficulty, old man.
Where have you been?

356
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,156
We didn't pass you.

357
00:26:11,208 --> 00:26:14,405
We've just been enjoying a
delicious and most Ieisurly lunch.

358
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:15,573
You've changed.

359
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,782
Oh, and you've had a picnic.

360
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:22,699
Why couldn't we have had
a picnic. I love picnics.

361
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,830
Well, I don't know.

362
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,332
You think that old crock's
packed it in for good?

363
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:31,239
Well, don't worry about it. Are you
sure I can't give you a hand, old boy.

364
00:26:31,917 --> 00:26:33,578
Don't you think Wendy
ought to come with us?

365
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:35,953
I should hate her to miss
the parade.

366
00:26:39,833 --> 00:26:41,118
If you take my advice, old boy

367
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,829
The next time that old engine
dies, you'll take it out a bury it.

368
00:26:58,208 --> 00:27:00,164
What was that?
Honey, let's go.

369
00:27:00,417 --> 00:27:02,328
You think something awful's
happened? Could be.

370
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,656
Oh, Suzy.

371
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,285
Suzy!

372
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:08,993
You all right, Suzy?

373
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,285
Poor Suzy.

374
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:11,743
Poor Suzy.

375
00:27:18,917 --> 00:27:20,373
Having some difficulty, old man?

376
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,662
You know, we should take Rosalind with us.
I should hate for her to miss the parade.

377
00:27:27,167 --> 00:27:29,874
If you take my advice.
The next time that engine dies...

378
00:27:35,458 --> 00:27:37,073
Did you see his expression?

379
00:27:43,625 --> 00:27:45,365
Brighton 1 6 miles

380
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,414
Brighton 1 3 miles

381
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,748
It wasn't that funny.

382
00:27:56,458 --> 00:27:57,914
Wasn't funny a'tall, really.

383
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:00,956
You should have stopped
and helped him.

384
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,615
Would I stop and help Ambrose?

385
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,911
After all his insults
at Genevieve.

386
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:07,290
I wouldn't lend him a hand
if he was the Iast...oh, is that unfair!

387
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:09,665
I don't know what it 'tis
about these silly old cars.

388
00:28:09,708 --> 00:28:12,575
The moment people get into them
they start behaving like idiots.

389
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,537
You know perfectly well, if you were
in trouble, he would stop and help you.

390
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:18,198
Never!
He would! Never.

391
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:19,740
Anyhow.
I wouldn't ask him to.

392
00:28:23,917 --> 00:28:25,532
Alan! Steering's gone.

393
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,663
Sit tight Wendy.

394
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,115
Well be all right.

395
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,823
M m

396
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,114
Hold on, darling.

397
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:33,115
We'll be all right.

398
00:28:33,292 --> 00:28:34,281
M m

399
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,327
Sorry, darling.

400
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:48,869
Is it really serious?

401
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,493
Do you think
you can fix it?

402
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,574
I don't know. I can try.
It'll take hours.

403
00:29:04,167 --> 00:29:05,657
I need a ring spanner.

404
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,370
It's Ambrose. He's got one.
Just the sort I need.

405
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,157
MT” 17m

406
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,699
Ambrose!
Ambrose, wait a minute.

407
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,327
MT” 17m

408
00:29:39,083 --> 00:29:41,449
”Tim

409
00:30:06,958 --> 00:30:08,448
Give it to me again, darling.

410
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,331
20 minutes to spare.

411
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,161
How about a drink to celebrate?

412
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:50,200
Love one.
If you'd like, we've got time enough

413
00:30:50,958 --> 00:30:55,702
to pop across to the hotel and
check up that uh..Our rooms are okay.

414
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,867
Not now.
I'd like to see. What happens

415
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:02,114
In certain circumstances I could
forget all about the parade.

416
00:31:02,958 --> 00:31:04,664
Steady, junior, steady.

417
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,288
Ambrose.
Um?

418
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:08,870
Do you think the McKims
will get here? Alan?

419
00:31:11,292 --> 00:31:14,409
He'll be here on time if he has to push
that Darracq on his hands and knees.

420
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,573
There are the olivers.

421
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,206
Hello, old boy.

422
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,831
May I introduce my...

423
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,207
Miss Peters.
John and sally oliver.

424
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:47,745
What time is it darling?
Ten to seven.

425
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,367
We won't even be there for
the dinner. For the first time.

426
00:31:51,875 --> 00:31:54,036
First time ever in 25 years.

427
00:32:25,542 --> 00:32:28,454
Oh, I never wanted a bath
so much in all my life.

428
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,536
Darling, wait in the car a munute,
will you? Why, what's the matter?

429
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,699
I'll be right back.
But isn't it the right place?

430
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,240
Yes, but, well, just wait a minute.

431
00:32:36,917 --> 00:32:38,873
Take your bags?
Hold on a minute, will you?

432
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:43,994
Evening, miss.
Evening.

433
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,992
Had a nice day's driving, miss.
Thank you for asking,

434
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:48,952
In

435
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:51,952
Time now?
No.

436
00:32:54,083 --> 00:32:56,790
Darling, there's..There's something
I have to tell you. Well.

437
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,493
Well, we haven't got a room.

438
00:32:58,542 --> 00:33:00,328
That's absurb. Of course
we've got a room. No.

439
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:02,623
You sent them a wire
two weeks ago.

440
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,908
Yes but, last night when you said
you weren't coming, I..I..

441
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,869
You sent them another wire
and cancelled them.

442
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:07,622
Yes.

443
00:33:07,667 --> 00:33:09,578
And then you didn't tell me because
you thought I might be put off by the

444
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,661
idea of sleeping on the beach!
- Darling, please don't be angry.

445
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,786
They've given me the address of another
place and they say it's wonderful.

446
00:33:15,292 --> 00:33:16,247
Oh, wonderful!

447
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,412
Hotel grand palace

448
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:27,451
I should tell you that we don't usually
let this room until all the others are taken.

449
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:31,701
You see, I'm afraid it is a little
uncomfortable. It's rather noisy.

450
00:33:31,917 --> 00:33:32,622
Noisy?

451
00:33:32,667 --> 00:33:35,704
The lady who had it last,
one of our permanent residents, was

452
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,742
Totally deaf. So in her case
it didn't really matter.

453
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,534
Unfortunately, only
last week, we lost her.

454
00:33:46,208 --> 00:33:48,745
You see. It's a, its really very near..
I'm sure it will do very well.

455
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:50,623
Well it's really very close...
oh, that's all right.

456
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:53,704
Which floor, please?
It's number 57 on the fifth.

457
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:56,415
Mr. And Mrs. McKim.
Yes, that's right.

458
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:59,989
Is there a lift?
Oh no, I'm afraid we have no lift.

459
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,078
Is there someone who
can give me a hand with these?

460
00:34:02,542 --> 00:34:06,490
I'm so sorry, the hall porter is
just having his supper, but you
can leave them there, if you like.

461
00:34:06,542 --> 00:34:07,907
I think I can manage.

462
00:34:08,208 --> 00:34:09,914
Is the bath near our room,
please?

463
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,449
No, both the bathrooms are
on the second floor landing.

464
00:34:12,792 --> 00:34:14,828
The second. Yes, you'll see
them on your way up, and

465
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:17,947
When you want to take a bath, would you be
so kind to sign the little book you'll

466
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,707
find just inside the bathroom door?
- I'll sign right now.

467
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,822
Oh, I'm so sorry, but hot water is
provided only in the afternoons

468
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:26,947
between half past two and six.
- There's no hot water?

469
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,367
Yes, hot water is provided in the afternoons
between half past two and six.

470
00:34:30,792 --> 00:34:33,033
Darling, I think we'd better go up.
Oh, this is preposterous!

471
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:35,324
Do I have to sign the book
in order to have a cold bath?

472
00:34:35,375 --> 00:34:39,288
The rule simply says that hot water is provided..
You mean I can't even have a cold bath?

473
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,288
Wendy, please.

474
00:34:40,333 --> 00:34:43,575
I am very sorry, but I did not make
the rules. Well, then who did?

475
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,741
Oh, never mind.
I don't want to know.

476
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:55,368
No one's ever complained before.
Are they Americans?

477
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:56,957
I put in new plugs, but its
always the carburetor.

478
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,082
...anyone getting flustered
about his whipped crankshaft.

479
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,740
I don't care what anybody says

480
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:04,124
I woudn't use a
self-Starter if you paid me.

481
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:06,408
Cars are like everything else,
you've got to look after them.

482
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,619
What can you expect from a
teased out old Darracq?
Ho. Ho...

483
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:11,619
He won't dare show his face
around the club for months.

484
00:37:11,792 --> 00:37:13,828
I'm sure to say not even arriving
in time for the dinner.

485
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,869
They've made it.
Here they are.
Hah hah

486
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,745
I was so afraid you weren't going
to get here. We very nearly didn't.

487
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:24,124
Well, have you enjoyed your first
race? Well, old sport?

488
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:25,873
We had a spot of trouble.
Spot? Don't you realize...

489
00:37:25,917 --> 00:37:28,750
Don't you realize that your Darracq
was the only...it could have happened to anybody.

490
00:37:28,792 --> 00:37:30,498
Ah?
It didn't happen to my spyker.

491
00:37:30,667 --> 00:37:33,158
Oh no. Haven't we had enough
about vintage cars for one day?

492
00:37:33,208 --> 00:37:35,574
Lord, I couldn't agree with you more.
I simply must know what was...

493
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,866
Are we going to have a party
or a club meeting?

494
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:40,249
Look, rosilind and I have put up with
your nonsense all the way down,

495
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:42,328
And tomorrow we have to put
up with it all the way back

496
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,081
Just for a few hours
let's have some peace.

497
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:47,947
Well I only wanted to know
what went on...oh, damn, you got
your bore. You're quite right!

498
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,697
This is only my first time. How
you do it year in and year out
I can't imagine.

499
00:37:52,708 --> 00:37:53,823
Shall we dance?

500
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,573
You sure you don't want
to dance some more?

501
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,991
Oh no, if you don't mind, I'm
afraid I'm not very good at it.

502
00:38:17,042 --> 00:38:19,328
No, you're not.
Still your better than Ambrose.
Uh.

503
00:38:25,458 --> 00:38:27,164
He knew Wendy before
you did, didn't he?

504
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:29,536
Said he'd introduced you.
Yes, that's right.

505
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,832
Well, I think it's sweet
the way you don't worry about it.

506
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,286
What do you mean?
Why should I worry about it?

507
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,957
Oh! Well, you know Ambrose
better than I do.

508
00:38:49,917 --> 00:38:52,078
That band's not awfully
good, is it?

509
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,740
Uh? You know.
You may not believe this.

510
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:56,579
But I can play the trumpet
much better than them.

511
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:59,332
When I was 16 I was in
an all-girl orchestra.

512
00:38:59,833 --> 00:39:01,243
Oh, but I had to give it up.

513
00:39:01,292 --> 00:39:03,283
Oh, why?
No future in it.

514
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,407
Anyway, it ruins your lip.

515
00:39:05,708 --> 00:39:08,370
You wouldn't think to look at me that
I had ever played a trumpet, would you?

516
00:39:09,667 --> 00:39:12,204
If you hadn't told me, it would
never have occurred to me.

517
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,537
What do you think of Rosalind, hey.
I think she's terrific. Really. Uh huh.

518
00:39:21,667 --> 00:39:24,454
I'll tell you something, Wendy.
In complete confidence, of course.

519
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,207
One of my greatest ambitions
all these years

520
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,790
Has been to... oh let's see,
how to say this.

521
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,408
Has been to combine the pleasure
of the London-Brighton

522
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:34,995
With a really beautiful
emotional experience.

523
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:38,075
You mean you never had?
It's incredible, isn't it?

524
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:40,081
Every single..
Now don't laugh, please, please.

525
00:39:40,333 --> 00:39:42,449
Every single year
something's gone wrong.

526
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,368
In '48 the wretched girl had to come
all the way to Brighton to discover

527
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:47,907
that she's got measles.
German measles.

528
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:51,246
And in '49 the wretched girl
locked you out of her room all night.

529
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,580
Poor Ambrose.

530
00:39:53,292 --> 00:39:56,455
What happened to the others?
Well, in 1950, she sudden...

531
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,370
Well, never mind the details.
The fact is That this time, at long last.

532
00:39:59,417 --> 00:40:04,411
The old London -To-Brighton
takes on a special significance.

533
00:40:04,667 --> 00:40:07,329
Congratulations, Ambrose,
I'm very happy for you.

534
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,205
Thank you.

535
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,870
By the way, did you ever tell
Alan about that weekend?

536
00:40:13,917 --> 00:40:14,952
In

537
00:40:15,375 --> 00:40:17,536
Why not?
He never asked me.

538
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:20,662
Well you don't suppose for a
moment he thinks that...

539
00:40:20,708 --> 00:40:23,700
that I was an emotional experience?
- No, I'm sure he doesn't.

540
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:26,241
Well I don't know. He's always
giving me some peculiar looks.

541
00:40:26,292 --> 00:40:28,123
Oh, no, you mustn't think that.

542
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:32,239
Alan may have a little short-Coming,
but he certainly not the jealouse type.

543
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,493
Thank you, dear.

544
00:40:49,083 --> 00:40:52,200
Rosalind, don't you think you'd better...
I'd like to play the trumpet!

545
00:40:52,667 --> 00:40:54,703
Would anybody like to have
me play the trumpet?

546
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:56,782
Hey, you must have had even
more than I'd thought.

547
00:40:56,833 --> 00:41:00,200
Wendy? You'd like to hear
me play the trumpet?

548
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,706
Well! Do think you'd should?

549
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,783
What's the name of your car,
clementine?

550
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:08,119
Genevieve.
Genevieve!

551
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,953
I'll show them how
to play the trumpet!

552
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,035
She must be blotto.

553
00:41:22,833 --> 00:41:24,118
Oh my!

554
00:41:35,625 --> 00:41:36,785
Oh, no!

555
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,123
She can play.

556
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:07,198
She's marvelous.
Yes.

557
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,741
Thats wonderful.
Well done, Rosalind!

558
00:42:30,208 --> 00:42:31,539
Hear she...

559
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:35,532
Exactly!

560
00:42:46,417 --> 00:42:48,078
Oh, listen!

561
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:23,579
Oh,darling. I love you!

562
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:57,249
There you are. That's
the way to play the trumpet.

563
00:43:57,292 --> 00:43:58,657
You were wonderful!

564
00:43:58,708 --> 00:44:02,405
I'll say without any hesitation,
that's the most astounding thing
I've ever heard in my life.

565
00:44:02,458 --> 00:44:03,664
That's genius.
That's what it was.

566
00:44:03,708 --> 00:44:05,744
Don't you agree with me?
Wonderful! Alan? Absolutely.

567
00:44:05,792 --> 00:44:07,874
Why on earth didn't
you tell me...

568
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:11,656
ncmrrml

569
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:13,535
\zcmrrmu

570
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:18,035
She's out.

571
00:44:48,292 --> 00:44:49,452
What's so funny?

572
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:55,199
Oh, don't pay any attention
to me. It's just mild hysteria.

573
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:59,120
Wendy. There's something
I want to ask you.

574
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,372
HlllnlllF-JIE‘IH

575
00:45:02,542 --> 00:45:03,622
I want to know...

576
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,286
Well, I want to know about,
about you and Ambrose.

577
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,865
What about me and Ambrose.

578
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,744
I think it's time I knew
exactly what's going on.

579
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,455
I don't know what you mean.

580
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,458
You know perfectly
well what I mean.

581
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,866
He brings a different girl
down here each year.

582
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:25,995
Let's not pretend we
don't know why. Well?

583
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:30,494
I've never asked you this.
I've never even mentioned it.

584
00:45:30,833 --> 00:45:32,198
But now I want to know the answer.

585
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:35,947
What answer?
What's the question?

586
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,831
What happened on the '49 run?

587
00:45:42,167 --> 00:45:43,623
I'm serious, I want to know.

588
00:45:46,042 --> 00:45:47,782
Wha..What happened on the '49 run?

589
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,535
Yes.

590
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:53,781
Um. Well, we left
hyde park at about 8:30.

591
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:58,288
And then we stopped over in
Surrey for a cup of coffee.

592
00:46:02,125 --> 00:46:04,286
Oh, Alan.

593
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:07,780
Do you mean what happened
after the annual dinner?

594
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,536
That's precisely what I mean.

595
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:11,574
Oh darling, are
you sure?

596
00:46:11,625 --> 00:46:13,161
Are you sure you really want
to know what happened?

597
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,366
Why, you've never asked me before.

598
00:46:17,417 --> 00:46:19,624
Why didn't you ask me
before we were married?

599
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:20,656
Look what happened!

600
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:25,909
Oh, it's silly to bring it up after
we've been married for three years.

601
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:27,198
Let's forget about it.

602
00:46:28,875 --> 00:46:30,911
Make love to me.
Don't be ridiculous!

603
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:35,830
Oh darling, you wouldn't want
to be married to a woman of

604
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,831
no experience whatever, would you.

605
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,990
What would do if I told you?

606
00:46:46,708 --> 00:46:48,744
You see? Don't even know.

607
00:46:49,167 --> 00:46:51,533
When you make up your mind
that you do. Then I'll tell you.

608
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:00,243
Make love to me.

609
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:04,331
Oh all right, if you don't
take the matter seriously..

610
00:47:04,333 --> 00:47:04,367
Oh all right, if you don't
take the matter seriously..
Alan, what are you doing?

611
00:47:04,375 --> 00:47:05,364
Alan, what are you doing?

612
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:07,658
I have some work to do on the car.
At this hour?

613
00:47:07,708 --> 00:47:09,369
Oh, can't it wait.
Alan!

614
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:39,247
"What do you mean?"

615
00:47:40,333 --> 00:47:41,789
"What would you do if I told you?"

616
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,703
"You see, you don't even know?"

617
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,492
I had a hunch I'd find you here.
Well, what do you want?

618
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,749
Well, what's so blasted
funny about it?

619
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,198
You are.
ever mind Ambrose.
You still have Suzy.

620
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:08,286
Wendy turned in?
Yes.

621
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:10,789
Why?
I just wondered.

622
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,242
You see, she's fed up with you
old boy, if I may say so.

623
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,915
Well don't worry about it.
Oh, but I do!

624
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:20,619
I mean I was the one
that brought you two together.

625
00:48:21,167 --> 00:48:23,078
I should hate to see
anything going wrong.

626
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,490
With your marriage,
i mean.

627
00:48:24,792 --> 00:48:26,032
Just, what do you
mean by that?

628
00:48:27,208 --> 00:48:28,618
Well, sometimes, old boy

629
00:48:28,792 --> 00:48:31,374
I have the feeling that you
don't really appreciate Wendy.

630
00:48:31,917 --> 00:48:32,952
Oh, you do?

631
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:36,287
Yes, I'm sure of it.
Well, I'm sure of something else.

632
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,867
We're getting awfully tired of you perpetually
sticking your face into our affairs

633
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,616
You're always hanging around,
soaking up all the drink in the house

634
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,623
Bothering Wendy.
Steady on!

635
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:46,789
Wendy always seems
glad to see me.

636
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:49,038
Now, look here.

637
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:52,666
If you're so keen on Wendy, you're always
pointing out you knew her before I did

638
00:48:52,708 --> 00:48:54,619
Why didn't you marry her
when you had the chance?

639
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:57,916
You know, I've often wondered
about that myself.

640
00:48:57,958 --> 00:48:59,494
Frankly I think the answer is...

641
00:48:59,833 --> 00:49:02,245
That Wendy's improved a lot
during past three years.

642
00:49:02,583 --> 00:49:04,869
I can't think why.
But there it is.

643
00:49:06,333 --> 00:49:07,823
You'd better clear out of here.

644
00:49:08,333 --> 00:49:09,368
Right now.

645
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:10,914
We were just going.

646
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:14,865
You know, I really
came to ask

647
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:16,703
If you'd like us to
take Wendy back tomorrow.

648
00:49:17,042 --> 00:49:19,624
After all, this old crock is
scarcely likely to make it.

649
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:22,124
Don't be an ass. Do you really
think that spyker of yours..

650
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:24,158
A ha! It wasn't the Spyker
that got you here after dinner.

651
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:26,199
This is a better machine,
and you ruddy well know it.
Nonsense.

652
00:49:26,250 --> 00:49:29,037
Look, I'm bored with all this.
Genevieve would leave you standing.

653
00:49:29,458 --> 00:49:31,119
I don't suppose you'd
care to back that statement.

654
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,707
I certainly would. Anytime.
First one to London?

655
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:37,827
All right.
How much?

656
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:39,368
Anything you'd like.
25?

657
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:41,874
Uh huh. 50? Right.
That's not too steep, for you?

658
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:45,116
Make it a hundred.
Aw now, wait a moment.

659
00:49:45,167 --> 00:49:48,034
What's the matter? Losing interest?
By no means. But a hundred...

660
00:49:48,083 --> 00:49:49,823
Hoy! It's just that I never
knew you were a gambler.

661
00:49:49,875 --> 00:49:50,990
It's no gamble.
This is the better car!

662
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:53,283
Even if it weren't,
you're such a rotten driver.

663
00:49:53,958 --> 00:49:55,539
What?
You dare say that to me?

664
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:57,248
\ 3:1:an m

665
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:00,373
Right. 12 o'clock at the pub.

666
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:02,032
We'll be there.
Come on, Suzy.

667
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,581
Wﬁllﬂlm

668
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:07,499
Friend of yours, guv?
No!

669
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,616
Alan, what on earth
are you doing?

670
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:49,916
I'm sorry, darling.
I had to strip her right down.

671
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:54,708
Darling, you can't do without
sleep. I'm all right really.

672
00:50:56,167 --> 00:50:57,156
Listen, Wendy..

673
00:50:57,792 --> 00:50:59,783
Ambrose was here.
Last night.

674
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,664
What did he want?
He said..

675
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:04,953
Oh it doesn't matter. The important
this is we made a bet.

676
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:05,989
We're racing back to London.

677
00:51:06,042 --> 00:51:08,829
Oh, don't be silly.
Ooh, it's cold in here.

678
00:51:09,458 --> 00:51:10,493
Wendy...

679
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:12,328
I bet him a hundred pounds.

680
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,615
You did...i know I shouldn't
have done it, but..

681
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:17,661
Oh! Wait a minute, Wendy
Listen Wendy!

682
00:51:34,417 --> 00:51:36,032
Darling, you have to listen to me.
I admit it was foolish,

683
00:51:37,542 --> 00:51:41,239
I admit it was wrong to do it,
but you have to come with me.

684
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:42,990
I'll have nothing to do with it.

685
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:47,869
You have to come.
I'm serious.

686
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,908
If you didn't come,
it'd be humiliating.

687
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:53,993
Alan, how could you?

688
00:51:54,833 --> 00:51:55,913
Oh, I don't know..

689
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:57,619
I was angry.
I lost my temper.

690
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,331
He was hinting things.

691
00:52:00,792 --> 00:52:02,623
He said you were always
glad to see him.

692
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,991
He said he wondered why he
hadn't asked you to marry him.

693
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,411
Marry him?
Ambrose?

694
00:52:11,125 --> 00:52:12,490
Are you out of your mind?

695
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:18,410
Oh, darling, I'm sorry. I know I talked
a lot of nonsense last night.

696
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,082
But you were so pompus and stuffy!

697
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:26,246
Oh, Alan, you must have
known I was talking nonsense.

698
00:52:32,458 --> 00:52:35,700
You can tell him
you didn't mean it.

699
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,532
Aw, I can't.
A bet's a bet.

700
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:40,912
We can beat him, darling.
I promise you we can beat him.

701
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:43,948
All right, I'll come.

702
00:52:44,375 --> 00:52:46,661
But if you've thrown away
a hundred pounds

703
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:50,788
Almost all we've got in the bank.
Just for the sake of a ridiculous bet.

704
00:52:52,542 --> 00:52:55,284
Oh, Alan, how can
you be such an idiot.

705
00:53:03,208 --> 00:53:05,665
Alan, darling.
What is it? Nothing. Nothing.

706
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:07,747
I'm just...

707
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,157
\iﬁlmml

708
00:53:49,708 --> 00:53:51,323
Ah..You're looking better, now.

709
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:57,072
Won't it be awfully boring.
Racing about in these old cars?

710
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,494
Boﬂng?
How fast do they go?

711
00:53:59,542 --> 00:54:02,864
Well, if he tears that car of his
to shreds she might get 27 out of her.

712
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:05,659
But I'll bet we'll absolutey leave him...
will you put me on a train?

713
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:09,913
Now look Rosalind. If I don't carry a
passenger, how can I expect McKim to?

714
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:11,743
All right.

715
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:14,456
Oh..What a weekend. Huh.

716
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:17,077
I'll tell you what.

717
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,615
If we win that hundred pounds

718
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:22,244
We'll pop over to Ie touquet,
next weekend, ne?

719
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:24,705
Ambrose...

720
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:27,787
That Ie touquet routine went
out with the high button boots.

721
00:54:30,292 --> 00:54:31,498
Ha hah.. Here they are.

722
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,035
Morning, sport.

723
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:38,036
We thought you might of
changed you mind. Wendy.

724
00:54:38,917 --> 00:54:41,784
I seemed to have left the party
rather abruptly last night.

725
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:44,745
Feeling better?
Well, pop down, then.

726
00:54:44,792 --> 00:54:46,703
Have a drink. We'll need one
or two for the road.

727
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:49,867
No thanks, I'd rather get started.
Ah..Well surely you'll have just one.

728
00:54:49,917 --> 00:54:50,781
No. Let's go.

729
00:54:51,083 --> 00:54:53,540
Very well then, on your way.
What do you mean?

730
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,245
Go ahead. We'll have a few more drinks,
then we'll catch you up.

731
00:54:56,292 --> 00:54:59,364
Oh. I think this is all
getting very silly, don't you?
Yes, I do!

732
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,786
Waiter. Another pint please.

733
00:55:04,417 --> 00:55:06,999
But if we're ever going to race
shouldn't we get started?

734
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:08,956
My dear old girl

735
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,616
When that car gets started

736
00:55:11,667 --> 00:55:14,158
You'll be intoxicated by the
exuberance of you own velocity.

737
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,240
Ha. Ha. Did'ya get that?
I said you'd...

738
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:19,658
You'll be intoxicated by the...
I'm not drinking anything a'tall today.

739
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,032
Nothing a'tall.

740
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,707
I'll show him.
The pompous ass.

741
00:55:26,042 --> 00:55:27,327
Any sign of them yet?

742
00:55:30,875 --> 00:55:32,866
Come off it, darling.
You want us to win, don't you?

743
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:35,998
Yes, of course I do.

744
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,414
But I still think it's
ridiculous.

745
00:55:40,167 --> 00:55:42,203
No I can't see them.

746
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:45,746
Good. Imagine him waving
us off like that. Conceited clown.

747
00:55:50,625 --> 00:55:52,240
Why don't you start it?

748
00:55:58,917 --> 00:55:59,906
I say..

749
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:02,036
Would you mind giving
me a push, please.

750
00:56:02,083 --> 00:56:03,744
They're in a race against that Darracq.

751
00:56:07,417 --> 00:56:08,702
All right, let's go.

752
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:09,910
Thank you.

753
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,365
Here we go.

754
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,124
Very decent of you.
All together now. Push up.

755
00:56:17,792 --> 00:56:18,872
Faster, please.

756
00:56:22,292 --> 00:56:24,248
Push up. Push up.
Come on. Faster.

757
00:56:25,083 --> 00:56:26,789
Faster. Come on. Faster.

758
00:56:29,083 --> 00:56:30,573
Faster, madame, faster.

759
00:56:30,958 --> 00:56:32,323
Come on, faster.

760
00:56:32,833 --> 00:56:34,323
Push, madame, push.

761
00:56:38,167 --> 00:56:39,452
NE | F m

762
00:56:55,292 --> 00:56:56,407
We'll have that.

763
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:10,621
Well, I doubt if they'll believe
us in court. But you were doing

764
00:57:10,667 --> 00:57:12,453
About 50 miles per hour.
Yes, but I can explain, officer.

765
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:15,249
You see.
Trying to kill yourselves?

766
00:57:15,292 --> 00:57:16,077
We're in a race.
Race?

767
00:57:16,125 --> 00:57:19,083
What are you racing in that?
Another fellow in a 1904 spyker.

768
00:57:19,125 --> 00:57:22,242
Since when has the veteran car
club gone in for racing?

769
00:57:22,292 --> 00:57:25,329
Well, it hasn't really. But you see...
well, you're in a restricted area!

770
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,456
You're not going to
give us a ticket, are you?

771
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:29,739
Sorry, madame.

772
00:57:29,792 --> 00:57:32,829
But officer, we're already
in so much trouble.

773
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:35,039
Who'd know if you
just let us go.

774
00:57:36,542 --> 00:57:38,157
We'd me so grateful.

775
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:41,697
Really.

776
00:57:44,208 --> 00:57:45,948
Well don't let's catch you again.

777
00:57:52,833 --> 00:57:54,039
Darling, you were wonderful.

778
00:57:54,083 --> 00:57:56,039
They might have kept
us there for 10 minues.

779
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,580
7;“ m

780
00:58:00,167 --> 00:58:01,156
If!

781
00:58:02,833 --> 00:58:04,619
Ambrose can't be
very far behind.

782
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,036
Get those sheep outta here!

783
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:13,074
You can't block up
the whole road like this.

784
00:58:13,375 --> 00:58:14,956
Go on, woman,
get 'em outta here!

785
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,119
Go on. Get out of it!

786
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:21,533
Look, there's a short cut
up there. We can round them.

787
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:37,288
Oh, Ambrose!

788
00:58:37,708 --> 00:58:39,073
Ambrose, no!

789
00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:40,705
In

790
00:58:45,708 --> 00:58:46,743
We're stuck.

791
00:58:47,042 --> 00:58:48,828
Lovely, get out and push.

792
00:58:48,875 --> 00:58:50,206
Me? What about my stockings?

793
00:58:50,458 --> 00:58:52,449
Aw, never mind those
I'll buy you a dozen pairs.

794
00:58:53,292 --> 00:58:55,533
Go on, Rosalind,
get out and push.

795
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,328
No, not like that.
Get your shoulder into it.

796
00:59:10,125 --> 00:59:11,831
There she comes.
There she comes.

797
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:19,447
We're gonna' go.
We'll back it get going.

798
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,411
Get going!
Come on, hurry up.
Get going.

799
00:59:21,708 --> 00:59:23,289
Get out of it.
Come on.

800
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:25,994
I'm soaking.
Look at my clothes.

801
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:31,447
I can't bear anymore!
Look at me. I'm absolutely ruined!

802
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:34,412
Aw, pipe down.
You're all right.
I want to go home.

803
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:48,999
Woman, don't you realize
we're in a race!

804
00:59:49,250 --> 00:59:51,332
Will you kindly get
those sheep outta here.

805
00:59:51,542 --> 00:59:52,873
Get 'em outta here!

806
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,698
We can get some
water over there.

807
00:59:59,042 --> 01:00:00,373
Quick, run in there
and ask for some.

808
01:00:08,583 --> 01:00:11,199
Oh Ambrose, stop for a second will you.
I can't see what I'm doing.

809
01:00:11,250 --> 01:00:13,912
Stop. How can I stop?
Are you mad?

810
01:00:14,708 --> 01:00:16,539
Now, see here, my friend.

811
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:20,073
I don't think
there's anyone here.

812
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,866
Oh, don't worry about that gate.
Run down to the stream.

813
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:30,407
Don't be long, Wendy!
Oh.

814
01:00:36,417 --> 01:00:40,911
Wendy! What are doing?
Hurry up! Oh, shut up. I am.

815
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:46,240
Look. There they are.

816
01:00:48,917 --> 01:00:51,124
Aaa hah hah hahhhhh
'Io!

817
01:00:59,625 --> 01:01:00,785
What's the matter?
What do you want?

818
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,198
It's my wife.
She's going to..

819
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,530
I've got to get the nurse. The district nurse.
Oh well, all right. Well jump on.

820
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:07,369
Hurry.
Oh thanks, thank you very much.

821
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,539
It's the next one.
The turning on the left.

822
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:12,199
What? Do you mean to say it's off
the main road? - Only half a mile.

823
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,741
There, that one. But we can't.
We're in a race...don't be so ridiculous!

824
01:01:15,125 --> 01:01:17,707
Don't be such a stinker.
This just isn't fair.

825
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:20,116
How can I be expected
to stand a junket like this.

826
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:36,285
He's making awfully
good time.

827
01:01:44,917 --> 01:01:46,498
Straight. Straight.
You're fine.

828
01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,241
Oh please, can't you go a little faster.
Shut up you...

829
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,954
You silly ass.
Go on. Go on.

830
01:02:05,208 --> 01:02:06,288
Anything wrong?

831
01:02:06,333 --> 01:02:07,869
There's nothing serious.
A broken fan belt.

832
01:02:07,917 --> 01:02:10,454
So I have to get to a garage.
Could you possibly give me a tow?

833
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:12,912
I'd be delighted. Got a rope?
Yes thanks very much.

834
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,869
On your way back from the big rally?
Yes,

835
01:02:22,083 --> 01:02:23,163
My name's callaghan.

836
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,289
J.C. Callaghan.
McKim, Alan McKim.

837
01:02:26,208 --> 01:02:27,163
A'AEFETTTH

838
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:32,823
Well what's the point of
rushing right now.

839
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:35,616
This won't take long to fix.
Without a we've lost?

840
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:36,497
Who said we've lost?

841
01:02:36,542 --> 01:02:38,703
Don't you admit that we've lost?
Why should I?

842
01:02:38,750 --> 01:02:40,832
But, being towed. You call that fair?

843
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:43,916
What did you expect me to do?
Tear it to pieces by driving with it loose?

844
01:02:43,958 --> 01:02:45,789
I didn't expect you to cheat.
- It's not cheating.

845
01:02:45,833 --> 01:02:47,039
You're just mad because
you twisted your ankle.

846
01:02:47,083 --> 01:02:49,540
If this isn't cheating.
Then what is?

847
01:02:49,583 --> 01:02:52,370
You've been the same all day. You didn't
want to come to Brighton in the first place.

848
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:54,453
That's got nothing whatever to do with it.
It's got everything to do with it.

849
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,582
...you've got to stick by the rules.
Rules? Who makes the rules, anyway?

850
01:03:03,042 --> 01:03:05,579
Haven't you got any brakes?
You stopped so suddenly.

851
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,991
Look what you've
done to this car.

852
01:03:08,042 --> 01:03:10,533
It's not that serious,
you know, my my insurance...

853
01:03:10,583 --> 01:03:13,040
Insurance?
What has that to do with it?

854
01:03:13,542 --> 01:03:16,204
This car belongs to my wife.
When she sees what...

855
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:19,873
Hey. How did we get
ahead of you?

856
01:03:20,917 --> 01:03:22,282
Just what does this mean?

857
01:03:22,917 --> 01:03:25,829
Have you conceded the race?
Take your hands off that car!

858
01:03:26,417 --> 01:03:28,703
Of course I haven't conceded the race.
I had to have a tow or i...

859
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:31,457
If we could need a tow to London,
we could be there in half the time.

860
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:32,831
What am I going to tell my wife? What?

861
01:03:32,875 --> 01:03:35,867
How do I know what you're going
to tell your wife. Ask my wife.

862
01:03:35,917 --> 01:03:37,657
But there wasn't a single mark on it!
Who cares about your wife.

863
01:03:37,708 --> 01:03:39,244
What do you want, a public apology?

864
01:03:39,292 --> 01:03:40,748
Why don't you get outta here.
You're trying to get into private arguments?

865
01:03:40,792 --> 01:03:42,783
She only bought the car last summer.
Oh, shut up!

866
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,615
You're worse than he is. Go away.

867
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,830
Go away. You go away!
Yes go away. Go on get outta here.
Buzz off.

868
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:48,955
Oh, really. Alan!

869
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,869
Can I help you sir.
It's my fan belt.
It's a broken link.

870
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:54,827
Right.

871
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:00,281
lﬁﬂfﬁm

872
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:03,124
If you want to cheat and be pulled I'm
not prepared to..

873
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:05,624
Oh look, what's the difference
between being pushed or pulled.

874
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:07,749
We were pushed for
nearly half a mile.

875
01:04:07,792 --> 01:04:09,657
You keep out of this!
Now stop it. Both of you.

876
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:11,664
You're being ridiculous.

877
01:04:11,708 --> 01:04:14,700
Either you callthe whole thing off
or else stop behaving like lunatics.

878
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:16,660
All right.

879
01:04:17,292 --> 01:04:20,034
If you're going to make this a race
in which anything goes,

880
01:04:20,083 --> 01:04:21,619
That suits me. I can fix it sir.
Right.

881
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:22,998
Whenever you're ready, duchess.

882
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:26,619
Isn't this becoming
just a little bit frantic?

883
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:28,535
Look what he's done to me.

884
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:31,450
Oh, he's no worse than Alan.
The same every year.

885
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,990
Come on. We're wasting time.

886
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:38,331
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

887
01:04:42,042 --> 01:04:43,031
Wendy.

888
01:04:44,208 --> 01:04:45,197
Thank you, sir.

889
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,490
Don't worry.
We'll catch them up.

890
01:04:54,250 --> 01:04:55,581
What's wrong now?

891
01:04:59,583 --> 01:05:00,618
Time check.

892
01:05:11,833 --> 01:05:14,700
Oh, these flies.
They'll drive me absolutely crazy.

893
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:17,036
Well, you don't seem to have
enjoyed the picnic much.

894
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,499
Yesterday, you said you'd rather have a...
that was yesterday.

895
01:05:20,458 --> 01:05:23,200
I'm sorry, Ambrose,
but I'm hot and I'm filthy.

896
01:05:25,167 --> 01:05:26,202
Anyway

897
01:05:26,417 --> 01:05:28,578
It was a sweet idea
and a nice surprise.

898
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:31,410
More wine?

899
01:05:32,083 --> 01:05:33,573
I shouldn't drink anymore.

900
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:37,115
Oh, it makes me so sleepy.

901
01:05:39,208 --> 01:05:41,199
Why don't you stretch out
and relax for a little while.

902
01:05:41,958 --> 01:05:42,993
Can I?

903
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:45,539
Oh. It would be heaven.

904
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,912
What about the race?
Don't give it a thought.

905
01:05:50,417 --> 01:05:52,203
We've all the time
in the world.

906
01:05:56,750 --> 01:06:00,368
But, if you lose that race..
We won't lose. We can't.

907
01:06:00,875 --> 01:06:03,332
McKim will be sitting
in that garage for hours.

908
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,661
How do you know he
hasn't already passed us.

909
01:06:12,708 --> 01:06:14,494
Because he'll be
looking for this.

910
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:21,700
You mean that car
won't even run?
Not ten feet.

911
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,366
So you see we haven't a thing in
the world to worry about.

912
01:06:24,875 --> 01:06:26,831
Well, I must say, that's a
dirty trick to play on anybody.

913
01:06:26,917 --> 01:06:28,657
Rosalind, you
saw him being towed.

914
01:06:28,708 --> 01:06:30,369
Anyway, I wouldn't
have taken his money.

915
01:06:30,417 --> 01:06:31,657
I don't care.

916
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:34,620
I think it's just a rotten thing to do.
Oh, be reasonable.

917
01:06:34,667 --> 01:06:36,032
I thought you'd enjoy a little break.

918
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,165
I've had as much
of this as I can stand.

919
01:06:38,708 --> 01:06:39,823
I want to go home.

920
01:06:41,667 --> 01:06:44,374
Oh, there's not need
to hurt Suzy. Come on Suzy.

921
01:06:51,833 --> 01:06:54,199
42 minutes.
I think this one will hold, sir.

922
01:06:54,250 --> 01:06:55,205
All right, thanks.

923
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:57,994
What kind of a man
can do a thing like that!

924
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,540
That's what I want to know.
What kind of a man.

925
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:02,744
Oh, darling, don't worry so.
You'll make yourself ill.

926
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:07,037
Best I can do sir.
Should get you to London.

927
01:07:07,583 --> 01:07:08,618
Thank you, sir.

928
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:11,993
Hope you catch him sir.

929
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:27,405
We'll never catch him up now, darling.
Never say die.

930
01:07:29,042 --> 01:07:32,034
What kind of a man?
What kind of a man, though?

931
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:35,245
I mean I had to have a tow
or burn up my engine.

932
01:07:35,292 --> 01:07:38,159
But, to make a bet and then to
deliberately to ruin the other man's chances.

933
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,163
What on earth are you...

934
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:07,074
If you're about to become
a father. I'm not interested.

935
01:08:07,125 --> 01:08:08,615
I'm sorry to trouble you sir.

936
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:11,124
But I wanted to ask if you
knew anything about the accident.

937
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:14,241
Some friends of mine
who were on the rally.

938
01:08:14,292 --> 01:08:17,079
A young couple name McKim.
We've just heard that they..

939
01:08:17,125 --> 01:08:18,160
Niallnh‘

940
01:08:18,458 --> 01:08:21,245
What, do you mean to say.
Was it a serious accident?

941
01:08:21,292 --> 01:08:24,034
Well, the chap that
just stopped here said.

942
01:08:24,542 --> 01:08:25,531
Oh my.

943
01:08:43,208 --> 01:08:44,414
Whom did you telephone?

944
01:08:45,708 --> 01:08:47,164
What are you grinning about?

945
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,540
I suppose I should be grateful
for a break in the gloom.

946
01:08:51,708 --> 01:08:55,030
Ambrose and Rosalind probably be in
London by now and laughing at us.

947
01:08:57,083 --> 01:08:58,163
What is it?

948
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,873
Oh, if you don't stop laughing
I'll go...

949
01:09:01,625 --> 01:09:04,412
Will you stop that
silly row?

950
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,074
It's a surprise.
And here it comes. Here it comes.

951
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:18,328
What's the matter.
Some kind of an accident?

952
01:09:23,208 --> 01:09:26,905
Someone's dying. Alan's rotten.
That dirty rotten.

953
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:31,956
I'll pay you back, for this.

954
01:09:38,125 --> 01:09:40,662
I still say, you shouldn't
have done it. I say

955
01:09:40,708 --> 01:09:43,165
He had it coming to him to let your
best friend think you'd been killed?

956
01:09:43,208 --> 01:09:45,995
My best friend.
Oh, shut up, you make me sick.

957
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,823
What's the matter, officer?

958
01:09:58,208 --> 01:09:59,243
You again.

959
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,870
What's going on?
This car's been reported stolen,

960
01:10:01,917 --> 01:10:04,750
Can't be them, dave. The report that
it was stolen only half an hour ago.

961
01:10:04,792 --> 01:10:07,579
It's that idiot we're racing.
The one I told you about.

962
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:10,037
He put in a false report?
Looks like it, officer.

963
01:10:10,208 --> 01:10:13,280
I'm afraid he's a little insane.
He wouldn't stop at anything to win this race.

964
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,411
Wouldn't he.
Where is he now?

965
01:10:16,667 --> 01:10:19,784
That's him, there!. - All right.
You go on. We'll deal with him.

966
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:23,244
Don't be too hard on him, will you?

967
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:25,331
He can't really help it, you know.

968
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:32,535
What's up, officer.

969
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:34,915
Your name, sir.
Claverhouses, Ambrose Claverhouse.

970
01:10:34,958 --> 01:10:37,620
Did you report a stolen car?

971
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:40,249
What?
Stolen car, no!

972
01:10:40,292 --> 01:10:42,123
Why this is my car, officer.

973
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:44,158
May I see your license, sir.
Yes, of course.

974
01:10:45,458 --> 01:10:46,197
WEI

975
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:50,831
Well, wait a minute.
I've uh...

976
01:10:52,208 --> 01:10:53,789
Ambrose!
Stop it!

977
01:10:56,917 --> 01:10:59,374
You'll have to stop somewhere for a minute.
- What?

978
01:10:59,833 --> 01:11:01,118
Oh, no. Not now.

979
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:03,119
Surely you can..
No, I can't.

980
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,539
If you don't mind.

981
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:07,656
Truman

982
01:11:07,708 --> 01:11:10,199
I had new wicks put in
all the lamps only last week.

983
01:11:10,375 --> 01:11:13,617
That tire's meant to be loose.
It's been like that for the last 49 years!

984
01:11:13,667 --> 01:11:17,330
It'd be more regular to have him
sign a proper statement

985
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:20,117
At the station.
Oh, but fair is fair, officer.

986
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:21,657
You've kept us here
for four minutes already.

987
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:23,369
If we join this girl now
we won't even stand a chance.

988
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:25,533
All right, but I warn you.
Ah, thank you officer.

989
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:27,665
One more trick like that
and you'll be in real trouble.

990
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,743
I bet that shook him.

991
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:34,663
There, that'll do.

992
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:13,749
I tell you straight off.
That's the most disgusting

993
01:12:13,792 --> 01:12:15,783
trick I've ever known a man to play.
- Which trick?

994
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:18,666
Stealing the top of my float chamber and
telling the police I'd stolen my own car.

995
01:12:18,708 --> 01:12:19,743
You started all that.

996
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,578
You can't even cheat
on a decent basis.

997
01:12:21,625 --> 01:12:23,411
You let us think you'd been killed.

998
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:25,665
Ah hah, ah well, the report of my
death was, uh,

999
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:27,118
what was it the man said?
Greatly exaggerated.

1000
01:12:27,167 --> 01:12:28,953
Who cared about your death.

1001
01:12:29,125 --> 01:12:30,410
I was thinking
about Wendy.

1002
01:12:30,458 --> 01:12:33,074
If it weren't for Wendy,
I'd give you a lesson you'd never forget.

1003
01:12:33,625 --> 01:12:35,616
Have you ever seen
anything like it?

1004
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:38,579
Is it really like this every year.
- Not quite like this.

1005
01:12:38,625 --> 01:12:42,413
Now, if you really feel in an instructive mood.
I warn you, I'm almost

1006
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,414
at breaking point.
- Go on then break.

1007
01:12:44,458 --> 01:12:46,039
I warn you.
Then what are you waiting for?

1008
01:12:46,083 --> 01:12:47,289
What are you waiting for?

1009
01:12:47,667 --> 01:12:50,864
What goes on inside their heads
that's what I'd like to know.

1010
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,117
I don't know about your husband,
but Ambrose seems to think of only

1011
01:12:54,167 --> 01:12:57,830
Two things. That silly old car,
and the other thing. - What other thing?

1012
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:01,707
Oh, no. My husband
only thinks about the car.

1013
01:13:08,333 --> 01:13:09,368
Oh, dear.

1014
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,158
Now then. Now then.

1015
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:19,032
Oh, no!

1016
01:13:19,625 --> 01:13:22,412
All right. Come on. Break it up.
Break it up. Break it up.

1017
01:13:24,417 --> 01:13:27,580
Well, don't look at me. He started all this!
I was only thinking of her.

1018
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,322
First, you decide to
stage a race on a public

1019
01:13:34,375 --> 01:13:36,036
Highway.
Not in sound cars

1020
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,665
With decent brakes.
But in two museum pieces.

1021
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,949
Which were out of date 40 years ago.
- Officer, really.

1022
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,164
Then, you go tearing through
a restricted area at 50 miles per hour.

1023
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:49,326
He can't do 50 miles per hour.
- Then you put in false reports to the police.

1024
01:13:49,375 --> 01:13:53,573
Well. Then you decide you can't be
satisfied unless you bash each

1025
01:13:53,625 --> 01:13:55,240
Other's brains out.
There was nothing to it. Really.

1026
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:59,117
Now, we wouldn't like you gentlemen to
think we're being unreasonable

1027
01:13:59,167 --> 01:14:01,328
Oh, thank you very much...

1028
01:14:01,375 --> 01:14:03,366
but if there's one more bit of
trouble from either of ya.

1029
01:14:03,750 --> 01:14:06,082
We'll pull you in on
so many different charges

1030
01:14:06,125 --> 01:14:08,116
you won't be out in
time for next year's Brighton run.

1031
01:14:09,708 --> 01:14:11,869
Let's go. These two are
driving me balmy.

1032
01:14:11,917 --> 01:14:14,909
All right, come on now.
All over.

1033
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:16,911
You shouldn't encourage
them, you know.

1034
01:14:17,292 --> 01:14:18,657
NE | H

1035
01:14:19,250 --> 01:14:22,617
This is the end! Making a public
spectacle of yourselves.

1036
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,117
Oh well. I wouldn't of believed you
could have behaved like this.

1037
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:28,248
Either of you!
Just hauling like brooligans.

1038
01:14:29,375 --> 01:14:31,161
Hauling like brooligans?

1039
01:14:32,167 --> 01:14:33,407
Well,
brawling like hooligans.

1040
01:14:33,875 --> 01:14:36,582
He was hauling like a
brooligan, not me.

1041
01:14:36,625 --> 01:14:37,785
Don't you call me a brooligan.

1042
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:39,740
It's not funny!
Oh, goodness sake et's go home.

1043
01:14:41,208 --> 01:14:44,120
All right. Let's call the
whole thing off and have a party.

1044
01:14:44,292 --> 01:14:46,408
Look, the pub will be open
in ten minutes, what do you say?

1045
01:14:46,458 --> 01:14:48,289
All right. That's a good idea.
Come on. Let's go.

1046
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:51,249
Got you're sure, lovely cream.
Yes. Let's have four doubles.

1047
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:53,540
All out, or take them with you?

1048
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,160
What are you laughing about?

1049
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:01,830
[-1.1

1050
01:15:02,667 --> 01:15:05,739
Look! Hi dee. Oh!
Doubles all around!

1051
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:06,993
Cheers, my dear.

1052
01:15:09,625 --> 01:15:12,287
I was wondering what that
chap you backed into told his wife.

1053
01:15:13,500 --> 01:15:16,162
Tell me. How did you get
behind us back at pease cottage.

1054
01:15:17,833 --> 01:15:20,495
Eh? Oh! We picked up an expectant
father looking for the district nurse.

1055
01:15:20,708 --> 01:15:23,495
In the time I wasted with him.
I could have delivered the brat myself.

1056
01:15:26,208 --> 01:15:27,163
These are good.

1057
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,367
You know, everything being said,
we've made jolly good time.

1058
01:15:32,875 --> 01:15:34,661
Oh, I don't know.

1059
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,707
If we'd really wanted to we could have
been in London 2 hours ago.

1060
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:41,412
Why weren't you, then. I didn't want to take
your money, old sport.

1061
01:15:41,458 --> 01:15:42,823
Ask Rosalind.
Didn't I say to you...

1062
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:44,991
If you didn't want to take the
money, why did you make the bet?

1063
01:15:45,250 --> 01:15:46,706
Well.
Heat of the moment, old boy.

1064
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:49,708
As soon I realized you hadn't a chance.
A chance? We were ahead of you!

1065
01:15:51,125 --> 01:15:52,240
Now, look.

1066
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,078
But there are still
nine miles to the bridge.

1067
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:56,741
You don't think you could
have stayed ahead of us, do you.
I most certainly do.

1068
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:58,953
What difference does it make,
who's ahead of who?

1069
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:01,745
It makes every difference.
It was his idea we call off the race.

1070
01:16:01,917 --> 01:16:04,124
Do you really think
you'd stand an earthly?

1071
01:16:04,167 --> 01:16:05,703
I've a good mind to
hold you to that bet.

1072
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:08,662
Hold me? As far as I'm concerned.
The bet's still on.

1073
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:11,290
Oh, you're not serious. Right!
But if that old crock of yours falls

1074
01:16:11,333 --> 01:16:13,324
to pieces you've asked for it.
Come on Rosalind.

1075
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:15,991
First on westminster bridge.
You're on. Here we go again.

1076
01:16:16,042 --> 01:16:17,578
What?
Can't you be reasonable?

1077
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:19,828
We gave you a chance
to call it off.

1078
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:25,740
Look, there's just one thing.

1079
01:16:25,792 --> 01:16:28,499
Whatever you think of that car,
she'd fetch a 100 pounds tomorrow.

1080
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,873
Is that right?
Oh, easily. But I

1081
01:16:29,917 --> 01:16:32,704
All right. The bet's still on.
But if I lose, I won't pay you a 100

1082
01:16:33,125 --> 01:16:35,081
I'll give you Genevieve.
Genevieve?

1083
01:16:35,125 --> 01:16:37,036
Oh, look Alan.
That's fair enough, isn't it?

1084
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,115
Isn't it?
Well... first over the bridge.

1085
01:16:39,167 --> 01:16:40,577
First over the bridge.
Get in, Rosalind.

1086
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,615
But, Alan, Surely you don't...

1087
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,828
there's no money involved.
I'm betting the car.

1088
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,991
It's got nothing whatsoever to do with you.
If you don't like it you can get out and take a bus.

1089
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:55,124
Look, don't you think this is getting a little out of..
What has it got to do with you?

1090
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,247
You heard what he said.

1091
01:16:56,292 --> 01:17:00,240
Either get out of this car and take that silly
mutt with you or stop your blasted nattering.

1092
01:17:01,292 --> 01:17:03,078
...that truck of yours
falls to pieces.

1093
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,910
Silly ass!

1094
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,491
You really think you can beat him?
Of course I can.

1095
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,286
First on westminster bridge!
Ok!

1096
01:17:32,417 --> 01:17:33,577
Come on, Alan.

1097
01:17:42,750 --> 01:17:44,706
Come on, quickley!
Come along.

1098
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:46,581
Come along.
We're in a race.

1099
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:48,991
Let's go.
Hurry!

1100
01:17:50,708 --> 01:17:51,493
They're going!

1101
01:17:52,375 --> 01:17:53,364
Take it away!

1102
01:17:53,708 --> 01:17:55,949
Leave me alone.
Hurry up.

1103
01:17:56,125 --> 01:17:59,447
Come on.
I want my ice cream!

1104
01:18:00,333 --> 01:18:01,664
Take it off the...

1105
01:18:01,708 --> 01:18:03,664
Come on. Hurry up.

1106
01:18:03,708 --> 01:18:05,994
Come on!

1107
01:18:06,333 --> 01:18:07,368
Before I

1108
01:18:08,875 --> 01:18:10,536
She's missing!
They're coming!

1109
01:18:13,875 --> 01:18:15,581
Ah!
They're coming.
Can't be the

1110
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:17,866
They're coming.

1111
01:18:25,292 --> 01:18:26,407
Come on.

1112
01:18:31,708 --> 01:18:33,164
They're coming.
They're coming!

1113
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:36,910
Oh, come on.

1114
01:18:37,583 --> 01:18:38,572
They're coming!

1115
01:18:38,875 --> 01:18:42,038
Oh, Alan, faster, faster!

1116
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,580
Oh, come on!

1117
01:18:45,875 --> 01:18:47,035
Faster. Faster.

1118
01:18:49,708 --> 01:18:50,697
kllllilK‘IIIEh‘

1119
01:18:51,458 --> 01:18:52,698
This is ridiculous.
Ah.

1120
01:18:54,250 --> 01:18:55,535
Get outta here!

1121
01:18:56,167 --> 01:18:58,453
Move on, madame.
Woman driver.

1122
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:03,493
Get out of it!

1123
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,616
Get out of the way,
madame!

1124
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:19,247
Go along.

1125
01:19:19,833 --> 01:19:20,948
Go on. Pull over.

1126
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:23,456
Pull out. Madame.
Ah!

1127
01:19:28,167 --> 01:19:29,998
Look, look at the lorry.

1128
01:19:32,625 --> 01:19:34,581
Hey! I want to get outta here.
I'm in a race.

1129
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:39,535
Go away.

1130
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:43,582
Come on, chum. Back out of it.
I want to get outta here.

1131
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:52,532
Get that other car to move.

1132
01:19:54,792 --> 01:19:56,407
Oh, blast!

1133
01:20:06,167 --> 01:20:07,247
He's coming.

1134
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:14,781
You wait!

1135
01:20:15,042 --> 01:20:17,249
That cop is on my side.
It's not over yet! Well.

1136
01:20:21,667 --> 01:20:23,157
Who..Whoosh.
It's a Darracq!

1137
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:27,785
A Darracq, sir.

1138
01:20:28,042 --> 01:20:31,489
On, my word, sir. Forgive me speaking to
you without an introduction.

1139
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:32,827
She's beautiful, sir.

1140
01:20:32,875 --> 01:20:34,957
Beautiful! This's the first car
I ever owned, sir, Darracq.

1141
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,449
Aristocrats. All of 'em.
But, there's not a scratch her!

1142
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,456
I'm sorry sir.
You have to excuse me.

1143
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:44,832
First car that I ever owned,
sir, a Darracq.

1144
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:48,288
I'm sorry, sir, you have to excuse me.
I would never have believed it possible!

1145
01:20:48,333 --> 01:20:52,622
If you knew the pleasure it gives
me to see this wonderful car.

1146
01:20:52,667 --> 01:20:55,955
So wonderfully kept.
It's almost too good...

1147
01:20:56,125 --> 01:21:00,289
I wish my wife was here. Yes sir, do
you know it was a Darracq exactly like
this one that I asked my wife to marry me.

1148
01:21:00,708 --> 01:21:04,246
1904, so it was, pangbourne.
And she said yes.

1149
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,035
But, oh..

1150
01:21:06,083 --> 01:21:07,698
It was the car.
I'm sure of that.
It was the car.

1151
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:12,868
I hope I'm not holding you up.

1152
01:21:14,792 --> 01:21:15,952
No at all, sir.

1153
01:21:16,167 --> 01:21:19,079
I knew there were chaps like you.
You know. Keeping up these old cars.

1154
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:22,367
We don't get about as much as
we used to, you know. - No.

1155
01:21:23,333 --> 01:21:26,166
Look, perhaps you's like me to come over.
I'll give you a drive in it, sometime.

1156
01:21:26,208 --> 01:21:29,325
But uh.. Do mean to say..
But that's very kind, you would really do that?

1157
01:21:29,375 --> 01:21:32,082
I simply can't tell you... wait a moment.
I'm sure I've got a card.

1158
01:21:32,125 --> 01:21:33,831
Your wife might like
to come, too

1159
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:35,490
And take the wheel
yourself, if you like.

1160
01:21:36,167 --> 01:21:36,997
I say, sir.

1161
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,749
Tomorrow evening?
Tomorrow!

1162
01:21:39,792 --> 01:21:41,953
I'm very grateful, sir.
Very grateful, indeed.

1163
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,865
Good day, sir.
Good day, madame.

1164
01:21:43,917 --> 01:21:45,748
Good bless you.
God bless you.

1165
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:03,702
A wonderful old man.

1166
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:08,490
Oh, Alan!

1167
01:22:09,375 --> 01:22:10,740
What's the matter?

1168
01:22:11,417 --> 01:22:12,748
What are you crying about?

1169
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:16,822
Oh, darling, when you just sat there.
When you just sat there

1170
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,160
I knew what you were thinking.

1171
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:20,536
I knew you wouldn't just
drive away and leave him.

1172
01:22:21,042 --> 01:22:22,122
Come on, Wendy.

1173
01:22:22,333 --> 01:22:24,073
You know I don't
like to see you cry.

1174
01:22:24,125 --> 01:22:25,456
But you've lost her.

1175
01:22:25,917 --> 01:22:28,875
You've lost Genevieve.
I'll survive.

1176
01:22:29,542 --> 01:22:30,577
Oh, darling.
I'm so sorry.

1177
01:22:30,958 --> 01:22:32,289
Wendy, stop it,
will you?

1178
01:22:32,875 --> 01:22:34,240
There's not reason to cry.

1179
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,616
I mean a bet's a bet. I wouldn't have
made it if I hadn't been prepared to lose.

1180
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:40,329
But Genevieve means more
to you, than, than anything.

1181
01:22:40,500 --> 01:22:41,660
You know she does.

1182
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,536
You'll give him the money instead.
Promise me you will.

1183
01:22:46,833 --> 01:22:48,494
Wendy, be sensible.

1184
01:22:48,542 --> 01:22:50,203
Promise me. I shall hate myself
for the rest of my life.

1185
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:53,787
We'll talk about it. No. No,
you can always talk me into anything.

1186
01:22:54,375 --> 01:22:55,455
Say you will.

1187
01:22:56,167 --> 01:22:57,327
Well it..
Say it!

1188
01:22:58,958 --> 01:22:59,822
All right.

1189
01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:02,073
But it'll leave us
practically penniless.

1190
01:23:02,125 --> 01:23:03,331
Who cares about that.

1191
01:23:19,208 --> 01:23:20,948
Look.

1192
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:29,248
All right. All right.
All right.

1193
01:23:37,833 --> 01:23:39,539
Leave it.
I'll get it.

1194
01:23:40,458 --> 01:23:42,323
Come on.

1195
01:23:43,792 --> 01:23:44,702
Come on, Wendy.

1196
01:23:44,958 --> 01:23:46,368
All right.
Don't forget.

1197
01:23:49,458 --> 01:23:51,119
Now, that's the lot.
Now get outta here!

1198
01:23:59,708 --> 01:24:00,697
In

1199
01:24:05,375 --> 01:24:06,490
Look, there they are.

1200
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:20,865
She's stalled.

1201
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:23,077
Push the pedal.

1202
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:31,539
Push the pedal!

1203
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,039
You get in and steer.

1204
01:24:42,917 --> 01:24:45,249
Come on, push.
I am pushing.

1205
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:53,118
Oh. Come on!

1206
01:24:57,792 --> 01:24:58,656
um

1207
01:25:05,292 --> 01:25:06,623
Aha. We got 'em.

1208
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:13,660
It's stuck.

1209
01:25:54,917 --> 01:25:56,532
You wait till next year!

1210
01:25:56,792 --> 01:25:57,827
You wait!

1211
01:25:58,125 --> 01:25:59,911
If I'm driving..
I'm driving I'd show you.

1212
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:02,165
I'd been there two hours ago by...
