1
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,579
- Travers?
- That's right.

2
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,418
Bert Connolly. Glad to meet you.

3
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:12,129
- Did you have a nice trip down?
- Fair.

4
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,250
- I've fixed for you to stay with us.
- Oh...

5
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,843
I don't think that's a very good idea.

6
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,839
- Well, whatever you say.
- Well, let's push off, shall we?

7
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:24,138
As far as everybody else is concerned,
we meet for the first time tomorrow.

8
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,502
No, I just thought she was
a long time in the bathroom,

9
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,550
so I went in and there she was being sick.
So, I asked her, "What's up?"

10
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:02,968
- Morning, Tom.
- Hello, Jack.

11
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,559
- You know, just asked her...
- How about practice today, Tom? Any go?

12
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,349
Yeah, all right, fine.
Tell the boys.

13
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,597
There aren't that many ways of saying it.
I just said,

14
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,645
"Don't tell me you're in the club again,"
and that set her off.

15
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,064
Oh, dear! The old Italian stuff
started hitting the fan,

16
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,031
- and she's yelling at me, "Yes, she is!"
- Yeah, those Italians can't half hand it out.

17
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,569
- All right, Tom?
- Hi, Freddie.

18
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,284
- Don't feel like it this morning?
- No.

19
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,820
Hello, Doris, how goes it?

20
00:03:25,956 --> 00:03:28,039
What's the matter?
Saving it up for Christmas?

21
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,204
There again, I was only asking.
You know... is it too late? That's all.

22
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,328
And bang, she starts all over again!

23
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:37,082
Ooh, look at that
seventeen jewel movement!

24
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,506
She reckons she's nine weeks over.
What would that make it?

25
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,721
May? Yeah, end of May.

26
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,761
Would be,
I don't even get the tax rebate.

27
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,305
- You're really in trouble, boy.
- Wouldn't you be worried?

28
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:51,601
Yeah, I'd be worried, I'd be doing me nut -
I'm not married.

29
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:53,598
See you in a minute.

30
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,170
Hey!

31
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:24,637
- Concerns you, you know?
- Really? Jolly good!

32
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,892
- What's ol' Gladys doing then?
- Yeah, whatcha doing, Gladys?

33
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,686
Don't call me Gladys!

34
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,150
Hey, Chuck,
you gonna have a basin of this?

35
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,689
Have a giggle, eh?

36
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,188
Nah... what for?

37
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,407
What for?
You can read, can't you?

38
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:46,571
Yeah, bleedin' union man, ain't you?

39
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,945
Nah... he's Salvation Army.

40
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,572
Ol' Eddie... "Salvation Army"!

41
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,200
- Come on, let's have a giggle, eh?
- Any tarts out there?

42
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,953
- Yeah, that's right, sit with the tarts, eh?
- Watch it. Davis.

43
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:01,583
So? We're entitled to study
union notices, ain't we?

44
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,299
Yeah, well now, brothers,
I hope you'll all be willing to support...

45
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,093
All right, let's get to work!

46
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:10,262
Only keeping up with current affairs,
Mr Davis.

47
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,885
Yeah, you wanna keep up with haircuts -
do you more good.

48
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,559
You'll get that lot caught in a lathe
one of these days.

49
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,148
I'll be Yul Brynner then, won't I?

50
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,189
Ol' Eddie! Yul Brynner!

51
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:32,117
Mr Connolly!

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,418
My fault. My fault.

53
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:43,382
- You all right?
- Yes.

54
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,002
Stupid of me.
Don't know what I was doing.

55
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,720
- You'd better go and see Sister.
- No, I don't want to make a fuss.

56
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,091
No, it's not a question of fuss.
You go and see Sister.

57
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:52,467
You might have shock later on.

58
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:56,095
You report as per regulations
and you got the company for damages.

59
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:58,644
Should be guard rails
on all these machines!

60
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,392
I've been saying so for ages!

61
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:02,894
I should get along and see Sister.

62
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,238
- I was coming to tell you about...
- I'll see to him. Get off.

63
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,528
I do feel a bit faint,
as a matter of fact.

64
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,401
Silly thing to happen!

65
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,201
My name's Connolly.
All right, boys, the show's over!

66
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,198
Start it up, Ted!

67
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,200
Are you familiar with these?

68
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,420
Well, you have a look around.
I'll be back with you in a minute.

69
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,089
What was all that about?

70
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,928
Your old tabby got herself caught up
in one of them VMBs.

71
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,514
- She all right?
- I sent her off to see Sister.

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,975
Um...
Well, she's gone for the day then.

73
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:38,267
Could have lost an arm, you know.
Should be guard rails fixed.

74
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,515
Well, get them out of store then.

75
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,482
They're all down there rusting up.

76
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,477
It's the blokes who take the things off,
not me.

77
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,229
It's the law,
and it should be enforced.

78
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,821
Look, Bert, don't tell me the law.

79
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:51,113
The men take the guards off cos it's
too much trouble to work round them.

80
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,327
You want them back,
I'll put them back.

81
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,663
How about that new bod -
is he any good?

82
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,656
Well, if you mean
"can we use him", yes.

83
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,249
Right. Well, start him then.

84
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,169
I did it, boy, I finally did it.

85
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,005
You know the one in the pay office
I've been working on for weeks?

86
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,591
She just said yes for next Sunday.

87
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,382
Let me see, I'm gonna have to do
a bit of switching around.

88
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,347
Yeah... gonna be a day of rest
for someone.

89
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:16,968
You know, I really flogged myself
to death over that little darling,

90
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,186
opening doors,
carrying the tray in the canteen...

91
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,647
Joe... look, do you mind?
Some other time.

92
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,266
What's the matter?

93
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:25,108
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

94
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,229
Still, er... could be worse, couldn't it?

95
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,981
I mean, the way I look at it,

96
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,779
you got two kids,
you might as well have three.

97
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,907
Not worried about me, are you?

98
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,123
I can move out if you like. You know,
be sorry to go and all that, but...

99
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:42,288
Well, if you need the extra room,
don't worry about that.

100
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,912
Mate, it isn't due tomorrow.

101
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,144
Anna!

102
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,768
Anna?

103
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:14,734
Oh. Just wondered where you were.

104
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,032
Everything all right?

105
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,201
- Where are the kids?
- They went next door.

106
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,117
You all right?

107
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,040
Yes, fine. Thanks.

108
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:30,375
I'm sorry about this morning.
Sorry I yelled at you.

109
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:46,607
Mum and Dad weren't over here
this afternoon, were they?

110
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,317
Yes, they came for tea.

111
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,279
I knew something had upset you.
What did they want?

112
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,739
You tell them you were expecting?

113
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,735
- I told your mother.
- What did she say?

114
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,281
Well... didn't say much.

115
00:08:58,413 --> 00:09:00,450
Not about the baby anyway.

116
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,325
All she talked about was
that you're just like your father.

117
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,497
That must have really cheered you up.

118
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,120
What's wrong with the telly?
The kids had it on?

119
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,373
No. Not that I know of.

120
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,417
Something special you wanted to see?

121
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,670
Yeah, big football game.

122
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:19,014
- Eat this while it's hot.
- Dead cert it had to go wrong.

123
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,178
What?

124
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:24,475
I said dead cert it had to go wrong -
finished paying for it last week.

125
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,522
- It's got sauce on it.
- If it's the tube, I'll kick the front in. Oh!

126
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,441
Brian! Cathy!
Time you were in bed.

127
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,066
- No, not yet, Mum!
- No, now! Come on!

128
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,445
They've been terrible today.

129
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,288
Would be tonight.

130
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,578
Always is when you want to
watch something good.

131
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,335
Brian, what are you doing now?

132
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,455
Nothing, Mum.
Cathy won't come out of the lav.

133
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,549
I shan't tell either of you again.
Come upstairs.

134
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,260
Brian locked me in the lav.

135
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,432
No, I didn't.
Can I have something to eat?

136
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,147
- Yes, he did.
- Oh, will you please be quiet!

137
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,891
And you shan't have any more tonight.

138
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,984
Can I have a bit of
bread and butter, Dad?

139
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,901
- What is he, hungry or something?
- He had a bigger plate than you.

140
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,069
- Please!
- Go on, then, just one.

141
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,317
Now she'll want one.

142
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,535
Well, they're growing, aren't they?

143
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:23,120
- Do you want one, too?
- Please.

144
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,491
Here you are then.
One each, that's all.

145
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,039
I said no.

146
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,287
Been playing a game with Ronnie.

147
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:34,460
Yeah, smashing game
called "sex maniacs".

148
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,172
Called what?

149
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,341
Old Ron thought of it all by himself.

150
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,216
- Can we have some jam, Mum?
- Come on, it's bedtime.

151
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,887
Did you hear what he said?

152
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,731
Daddy, when I came home from school
and I turned the telly on, it went bang...

153
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,522
Cathy, will you please go upstairs
and get ready for bed!

154
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,896
- Can we play with old Ron tomorrow?
- Well, we'll see.

155
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,489
Thought of that game all by himself.

156
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:06,280
Cathy, let's go round
to old Ron's tomorrow, eh?

157
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,292
I'll give him "old Ron" -
I'll have a sharp word with his father.

158
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,954
They don't know what it means.

159
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,207
Our two might not.
I'm not so sure about old Ron.

160
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:20,632
I don't know... kids!

161
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,220
They drive you up the wall.

162
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,808
What is it, love?

163
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,229
You are pleased about the baby,
are you?

164
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,366
I mean, when you get used to the idea,
you will be pleased.

165
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,327
Of course I will.

166
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,914
Sometimes I don't know you at all.
I don't know what you're thinking.

167
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,992
I don't mind now,

168
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:54,962
but I couldn't bear it
if you weren't pleased at all, not ever.

169
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,376
I'm pleased now.

170
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,591
Promise I am.

171
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,175
I know it was... it was a shock.

172
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,930
I don't mind you pretending now,
as long as you don't pretend all the time.

173
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,725
Look, I'm not pretending.

174
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,771
Annie. Annie, look at me.

175
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,112
Do I look as if I'm pretending?

176
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,367
- No.
- No, of course I'm not.

177
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:29,405
Look, I'll tell you what was wrong
with me this morning.

178
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,247
It came as a bit of a shock, right?

179
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:35,416
I wasn't prepared for it, you know,
and... Monday morning and that and...

180
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,663
well, we'll have to buy all the gear again,
won't we?

181
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,257
Now it's happened
we want to do it properly.

182
00:12:40,385 --> 00:12:41,466
That's all.

183
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,636
I thought perhaps we might get
out of here this year,

184
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,427
maybe put the down payment on a car.

185
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:50,175
But they'll still be selling Fords next year,

186
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:53,645
and we've stuck this dump since we were
married, so a bit longer isn't gonna kill us.

187
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:59,897
What's it feel like - boy or a girl?

188
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,611
It just feels like a baby.

189
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,906
They can tell now, you know.
Tell by the heartbeat rate.

190
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,862
You're so funny sometimes.

191
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,534
You don't know how funny you are.

192
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,039
You just sit here and think about that
while I get you a cup of tea.

193
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:50,365
D'you want to know, darling?

194
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:53,197
Hey, Marilyn, I'm talking to you.

195
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,084
What are you looking at, Grandad?
You better get inside.

196
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,123
The first house's started,
you'll miss the big picture.

197
00:14:00,131 --> 00:14:01,918
Stupid old git!

198
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,293
Where are you going, Ed?
Going down the park?

199
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,135
Staring at us, he gotta watch it!

200
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,176
Ol' Mick said he'd be down the park
with a couple of scrubbers.

201
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:12,095
Brian!

202
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,015
Well, this is D-Day, isn't it?

203
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,355
Too right, boy!
Starting the countdown.

204
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,475
Come on, Daddy! Daddy!

205
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:21,942
OK.

206
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:25,279
- Hope you count better than I did.
- Yeah.

207
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:28,774
- Who are you giving it to today?
- Nobody you know.

208
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:36,912
Who's he trying to kid?
It's that new tart in the pay office.

209
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,626
Ol' Mick had a go -
she don't wanna know.

210
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,512
Mmh... what do you want to do then?

211
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:58,888
How do you mean?

212
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,482
Well, we can't just lie here all day,
not talking or nothing.

213
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,567
I don't mind talking.

214
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,857
Well, you know what I mean.

215
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,821
Look, what do you think
I'm gonna do to you?

216
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,488
Tear your clothes off,
throw you in the bushes or something?

217
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:14,703
What, do you think I'm after
the old News of the World stakes?

218
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:17,118
I mean, I know I've been out
with girls before,

219
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:20,288
but it doesn't make me Jack the Ripper,
does it?

220
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,420
I don't know
what you're thinking -

221
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,335
haven't said nothing
since we've been here.

222
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,793
I mean, we could have saved the petrol,

223
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,671
stayed home and gone to church
or something - really lived it up.

224
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,133
Well... it's not as though
I forced you to come, is it?

225
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:38,136
Only asked you in front of
about fifty other people.

226
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,887
I mean, it was real intimate.

227
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,140
I don't know...

228
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,942
Shall I tell you something?

229
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,778
Yeah, surprise me.
You're married with three children.

230
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,773
You try too hard.

231
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,865
What do you mean, "try too hard"?

232
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:55,907
Listen, if I was trying hard,
I'd get somewhere, wouldn't I?

233
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,827
Believe me, I'm not trying,
I just don't like teases.

234
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,167
Who's teasing you?

235
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,753
Well, don't let's go into all that.

236
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,461
Seriously, what's the matter?

237
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,422
- You really want to know?
- Yeah.

238
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:14,217
Well, from what I hear you've been out
with everything on two legs

239
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,136
wearing lipstick and over age, and you've
got a couple of them in the family way,

240
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:18,850
and you didn't do anything about it.

241
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,892
I was told the first day I took the job
that you were the one to watch out for.

242
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,686
I saw you coming before you saw me,

243
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,525
and when I saw you I didn't care
what you'd done or what I'd heard

244
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,860
because you looked nice

245
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,447
and I thought I'd like to go out with you
if you asked me, and you did ask me.

246
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,783
And I still feel that way,

247
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:38,279
but it doesn't mean I'm going to be like all
the rest, or you'll get it the first time,

248
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,246
because I want something more than that.

249
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:42,991
If you can't give it to me,
you'd better know right away

250
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,743
so as we don't waste each other's time.

251
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,372
I see.

252
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,800
Yes, I see.

253
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,796
Well, that just about wraps it up then,
doesn't it?

254
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,260
Coming?

255
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,975
Bread and dripping, mate.
Bread and scrape, we used to call it.

256
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,974
That's all we had for years,
brought up on it.

257
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,897
My old man led the hunger march
down to London.

258
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,363
That was a time to be alive, believe me.
The workers was really together then.

259
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,858
Oh, yes, yes.

260
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:20,328
Erm... about this next meeting.
Can't have any slip-ups.

261
00:17:21,207 --> 00:17:23,415
Not bad grub here, is it?
Aren't you eating yours?

262
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,000
Oh, sorry, can't have any what?

263
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,244
I mean, if necessary
you'll have to rig it.

264
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,918
Rig it? What, the meeting?
How do you mean?

265
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,759
I didn't mean "rig it" exactly,
that's just a figure of speech.

266
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,425
The point is, the rest of them
look to you for guidance.

267
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:41,179
- They can't think for themselves.
- No, that's true.

268
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,017
So, you've got to give them that guidance.

269
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,559
Put it to 'em in a way they can understand,
but it's no good telling them everything.

270
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:48,523
Only confuses people.

271
00:17:48,651 --> 00:17:50,438
Yeah. Yes, I see.

272
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,061
Meeting lunch time!

273
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,032
- Meeting lunch time.
- What about?

274
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,988
If you spent a little less time
on the football pitch, you'd know.

275
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,285
I want everybody there.

276
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,124
Shut the door, will you?

277
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,751
I gather you're not satisfied with
the management's answer this morning.

278
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,623
I can't discuss union business.

279
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,466
No, of course not.

280
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,928
Just that I'm an interested party.

281
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:21,423
- Wanted to find out the facts.
- Well, you read the demands we put in.

282
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,347
Yeah, that's right, I did.
Course I did.

283
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,562
Well, let's forget about those for a moment
and talk about the real facts.

284
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:29,640
You trying to be funny?

285
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:32,184
You know me, Bert,
I never have time to be funny.

286
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,902
I just want to know what it's all about.

287
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,486
I've told you, I can't discuss
confidential union matters.

288
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,201
All right, well, I'll discuss them for you.

289
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,197
I'm not a funny man,
but I can spot a joke when I see one.

290
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,951
You're not contemplating coming out
cos there's no toilet paper in the bogs.

291
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:53,251
That was one of the things, wasn't it?
"Inadequate sanitary arrangements".

292
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:57,126
Look, Bert, I didn't get this job
by knocking you chaps over the head.

293
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,175
I worked out there once, remember?
I used to knock off the soap myself.

294
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:04,425
At least you've got toilet seats now -
in my day we didn't even have toilets.

295
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,099
- That was your day.
- I know what your real beef is, Bert.

296
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,813
You want a closed shop, don't you?

297
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,354
Well, maybe you're right,
but this isn't the way to go about it.

298
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,352
It's not that sort of factory.

299
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:16,979
Nobody's getting hurt.

300
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,652
Martindale's not carving you up
like some we could think of.

301
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,696
Everybody gets a fair whack.

302
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,864
If you want it all well and good,
come out and say so -

303
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,362
don't hide behind a smoke screen.

304
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,956
You'll get a closed shop all right.

305
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,242
You'll close the place down for good.

306
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,504
- I'm not prepared to discuss it.
- You're not prepared to discuss it, no.

307
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,339
Well, that's that then, innit?

308
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,174
And I'm busy.

309
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:48,927
Nice turnout.

310
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,607
What are you going to vote for, Gladys?

311
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:56,727
- Why don't you drop that "Gladys"?
- I'm asking you what you're gonna vote.

312
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,603
I don't know.
What's it all about then?

313
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,607
Are you in favour of mixed marriages
between the Scots and the English?

314
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,118
They're not voting on that!

315
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,455
'Ere, Eddie,
we get paid if we come out?

316
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,620
- Nah, unofficial.
- Waste of time then, innit?

317
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,914
Come on then,
what are you waiting for?

318
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,498
Come on!

319
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,460
Brothers... brothers! Brothers!

320
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,679
At the last meeting,

321
00:20:24,807 --> 00:20:28,721
a decision was taken
to elect a works committee

322
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,220
to represent you in dealings
with the management.

323
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,105
That decision was taken

324
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,350
in a democratic fashion

325
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,943
by the majority of brothers present.

326
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,064
I'd like to read you the official minutes
of that meeting.

327
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:48,324
That Connolly again?

328
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,373
How's he suddenly sprung to the fore?
Doesn't know his arse from his elbow.

329
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:54,333
Here, finish the bottle.

330
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,294
Beats me why you let him get organised.

331
00:20:56,422 --> 00:20:59,790
- We've managed here for thirty years.
- Yeah.

332
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,884
- Times have changed, you know.
- Yeah.

333
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:04,753
They've changed this much -

334
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:07,848
I'm paying more tax
and losing business hand over fist.

335
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,137
Lost four orders to Germany
already this year.

336
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,888
Well, we've got to help them get back
on their feet - after all, they lost the war.

337
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,980
Don't be so bloody clever.

338
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,642
This beer's flat, too.

339
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,524
- How serious is that?
- Depends how you look at it.

340
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,319
Well, I mean, what's he really after?
Closed shop?

341
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,534
Yeah, that's about it.

342
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,197
Well, he can forget that.

343
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,368
Only one union worth bothering about,
that's the hard work union -

344
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,708
of which I'm a founder member.

345
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:37,415
That crew down there'll
never get organised.

346
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:41,506
And since the management has chosen
to disregard our main demands,

347
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,125
we must take stronger action.

348
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,296
What sort of action?

349
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,262
I therefore call upon Brother Matthews
to put the resolution to you.

350
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,550
Mr Chairman, brothers,
the works committee move...

351
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,221
Propose!

352
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:57,815
We propose the resolution that if after
a period of 24 hours from noon today

353
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,524
our demands are not met,

354
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:03,521
we withdraw our labour from the factory
until such time as they are.

355
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:10,118
- Order, please! Order! Order!
- Mr Chairman!

356
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:12,989
Order!
Who will second the resolution?

357
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,536
- Thank you, brother!
- Mr Chairman!

358
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:18,285
Shut up, give him a chance.

359
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,127
Quiet, everybody, please!

360
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:22,293
Have you got something to say,
Brother Arkwright?

361
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,666
- Yes, I have.
- Right, go ahead.

362
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,005
You all know me here...

363
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,844
Who are you?

364
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,180
Sit down, Crippen!

365
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,926
I'm a working man, and that's more
than I can say of some people.

366
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,643
Ooh, sit down!

367
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,603
I've been through a few strikes,

368
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,519
I mean real, big strikes,
and I'm telling you,

369
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:43,109
you won't go far
unless you have right on your side.

370
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:45,524
- Point of order, brother chair.
- Yes, point of order.

371
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:47,238
Point of bloody nonsense!

372
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:53,070
I'm a union man,
and I don't stomach any messing about.

373
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:56,824
If you want to strike,
strike with the union behind you.

374
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,746
Just a minute,
we're all union men, you know!

375
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,083
Well, start trying to behave like it!

376
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,377
Never mind your big speeches!

377
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,593
- Tell us what we live on while we're out.
- What we live on?

378
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,758
- You heard me!
- You heard him!

379
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,549
In reply...

380
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,894
In reply to Brother Arkwright's
probably sincere,

381
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:20,935
but I promise you misguided remarks,

382
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:24,650
all I can say is that in disputes of
this kind sacrifices have to be made.

383
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:25,814
Answer the question!

384
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,562
Now, if there are no further questions,

385
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:30,782
I call upon you to vote by a show of hands
for the adoption of this resolution.

386
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,867
Those in favour...

387
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,706
- What are you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, what's the odds, put your hands up.

388
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,584
Come on, you haven't got
a family to support, you're laughing.

389
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,585
Not officially, anyway.

390
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,713
Well, this is an unofficial strike.

391
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:58,017
- Hundred and seven.
- That's right.

392
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,933
Those against...

393
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,182
Come on, hurry it up now.

394
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:21,829
Thirty-nine.

395
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,922
The voting was as follows -
those in favour, 107,

396
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:30,167
those against, 39,
majority in favour, 68.

397
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:34,258
The resolution is carried and will be
put before the management this afternoon.

398
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,722
I declare the meeting closed.

399
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:51,939
Good thing the wives
don't come out on strike -

400
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,441
you'd really feel it then.

401
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,488
Do you have to do what they say?

402
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,330
- Yeah, if they decide it, you know...
- No, you don't, not necessarily.

403
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:03,200
- Of course you do.
- Why? Don't see it.

404
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:05,668
Well, you can't run a factory on your own,
can you?

405
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,459
Who's talking about "on your own"?
Watch out.

406
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,128
Quite a few of us don't want to come out.

407
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,129
Yeah, all right, but I mean, you're still
bound to be in a minority, aren't you?

408
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:18,260
Still, as I say,
I couldn't care less about any of it.

409
00:25:18,392 --> 00:25:21,635
All that "brother" lark -
they can stick that.

410
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:24,433
No, the best thing is not to vote either way,
let them get on with it.

411
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:27,228
I mean, they will anyway,
so what's the odds?

412
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,566
You coming down the pub?

413
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:32,233
No, a few of us are getting together
down at old Billy's for a bit of a chat.

414
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,775
All right, see you then.

415
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,569
- Good night, Joe.
- So long.

416
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,613
Ta-ta.

417
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:40,578
He's marvellous, isn't he?
Just marvellous.

418
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,619
As long as he gets his beer and oats,
he don't wanna know.

419
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:55,173
I don't mind you -
I don't know about both of you.

420
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,387
- Were you as bad as he is?
- When?

421
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,471
You know, before we got married.

422
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,217
Why do you always
have to come back to that?

423
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,345
- What you don't know...
- ...doesn't hurt me, I know.

424
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,689
- Were you?
- Oh, yeah, worse.

425
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,524
And I started early -
I wore a muzzle till I was 14.

426
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,566
- A muzzle? What's that?
- Shh... not in front of the child, please.

427
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,190
What do you think about it,
you layabout, eh?

428
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,364
- He don't care.
- How do you know it's a he?

429
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,579
Ah, "she", then.

430
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:27,458
It's all right for old Joe -
he can afford to lose the money.

431
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,171
- What are you talking about?
- This strike business.

432
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,218
I wouldn't mind if it was
about something serious, but...

433
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:39,338
the whole thing's a storm in a teacup.

434
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,427
I'm sorry, but the answer's no.

435
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,052
Now, that's not a final no, it's just that
he's not prepared to meet all your terms.

436
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,898
- Now, just before you jump right into it...
- I'm not prepared to discuss it, Mr Davis.

437
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:53,018
We've had their answer,
now they can have ours.

438
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:57,071
All right! All right, that's it!

439
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,413
Ah, well, the dreaded veto.
Coming?

440
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,774
Come on, you lot!

441
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:40,903
Come on.

442
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:44,152
Come on, boys, let's get moving.

443
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,081
What can I do for you, Bill?

444
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,959
Well, we've had a bit of a talk together,
and we've been wondering.

445
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,677
Supposing there are some of us
who still want to work,

446
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,967
how would it stand like?

447
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,092
Well, as far as I'm concerned,
this walkout hasn't got the union backing.

448
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,310
The gates'll be open for anyone
who wants to come in.

449
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:12,476
The rest is your lookout.

450
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,606
Where do you think you're going?

451
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,480
You wanna watch it,
you'll get carved up.

452
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,194
Get all their names!

453
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,405
- I'm talking to you, mate.
- I'm talking to you.

454
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,915
- Is this all of you, Billy?
- Yes, sir.

455
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,705
All right.

456
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,523
Well, you'd better get on
with routine maintenance.

457
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,977
I've managed to scrape up
a skeleton canteen staff,

458
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:43,526
so you'll get your dinners all right today.

459
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:45,398
I don't know about tomorrow though,

460
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:49,198
so you'd better bring your own
if you're going to keep this up.

461
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:55,203
Yes, well,
they were dead keen to see us.

462
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:07,428
- What's up?
- All right, Stirling Moss, that's your lot.

463
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:11,391
- Watch it, son.
- Ol' Eddie! Stirling Moss!

464
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,100
What's your place playing at?

465
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,766
I was on to them last night -
they shouldn't have sent you.

466
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,684
First I've heard.
What's going on then?

467
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,559
Labour withdrawal.
This place is black.

468
00:30:20,694 --> 00:30:23,152
- Black, Charlie? They didn't tell us.
- No.

469
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:26,023
Well, pass it around when you get back.

470
00:30:26,158 --> 00:30:29,117
- All right, Charlie?
- I'm easy. Get home early for once.

471
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,780
OK.

472
00:30:40,714 --> 00:30:42,580
I know what I'd do.

473
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,532
Barrett! Come here!

474
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:20,535
I said, "come here".

475
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,129
Had the police on to me this morning.

476
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,919
- So?
- So, I'm warning you.

477
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,263
I want this strike to stay clean,
you understand?

478
00:31:32,391 --> 00:31:35,429
When I need your help, I'll ask,
so just watch it.

479
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:38,261
Otherwise next time
I'll tell the coppers where to look.

480
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,060
Be too bad, won't it?

481
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,328
Who sent for the police, Billy?
Getting scared?

482
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,611
- What do you think then, Billy?
- I think we should turn it in.

483
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:33,073
I don't mind about myself, but my missus
is getting too old for this sort of caper.

484
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,113
Didn't sleep all night.

485
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:37,453
They did another couple of windows,
you know?

486
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:39,789
It's been an eye-opener to me,
I'll tell you that much.

487
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,409
Yeah, I agree.
Not getting anywhere, are we?

488
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,252
What do you think, Tom?

489
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:47,246
Well, I'm going with
whatever you lot decide.

490
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,591
They missed my windows cos we're on the
first floor. Bleedin' landlady got my brick.

491
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,086
We all agreed then?

492
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,383
Well, the management
didn't want to know either.

493
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,258
Turn it in, eh?
Best really, ain't it?

494
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,726
Goes hard with me,
I don't mind telling you.

495
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:04,018
I mean, I'll have a scrap in the open
with anybody,

496
00:33:04,149 --> 00:33:06,357
but I've had it with this one.

497
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,069
Been an eye-opener to me,
a real eye-opener.

498
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:15,067
Thought you might have done
something about it - been home all day.

499
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:16,568
I never had it on.

500
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,695
Why don't you call the man in?

501
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,992
Can't afford to.
I'm out of work too now.

502
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,116
Mrs Curtis, you there?

503
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,368
- What's the old cow want?
- I'll go and see.

504
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,745
Mrs Curtis!

505
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,214
Tell her she'll have to wait for our rent
next week, that'll shut her up.

506
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,427
Ah, there you are.
Someone to see you.

507
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,922
- Who is it, Mrs Jackson?
- I don't know. Pressed the wrong bell.

508
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:41,426
- It's me, Mrs Curtis. Bert Connolly.
- Going to the door all night!

509
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:43,928
- Did you want to see Tom?
- If I might.

510
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,389
Please come up.

511
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,061
Sorry about the bell.

512
00:33:48,777 --> 00:33:50,939
- Bert Connolly.
- Here?

513
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,812
Come in, Mr Connolly.

514
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:55,235
I'm afraid the place is a bit of a mess.

515
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,903
That's all right, I'm used to it.

516
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,196
Would you like some tea?

517
00:33:58,328 --> 00:34:01,036
Oh, er... be very nice,
but only if you're making it.

518
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:04,998
Hello, Joe. Hello, Tom.

519
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,119
Bert.
Come to see how the rich live?

520
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:11,168
- What's the matter, the tube?
- No, the guarantee went.

521
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,042
Let's have a look.
I'm pretty good at fixing these things.

522
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,880
Ta.

523
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,805
Ah! Here's your trouble.

524
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,974
Try it now.

525
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,976
Enjoying the rest, Joe?

526
00:34:32,112 --> 00:34:35,321
- Makes a change, don't it?
- We could do with you on the picket line.

527
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,859
Ah! There you are!

528
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,575
Yeah, still not perfect though, is it?

529
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:42,241
Thanks anyway.

530
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:45,911
- Well, now. What can I do for you?
- Well, it seems you've already done it.

531
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,455
Old Billy tells me you've decided
to back us all up at last.

532
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:51,375
Well, we've decided to stay away
from work, yeah. That's right.

533
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,999
Seems a pity you didn't do that from
the beginning, like our brother Joe here.

534
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:57,252
Yeah. Pity all round, innit?

535
00:34:57,387 --> 00:35:00,551
Now, look, Tom, you know as well as I do
you got to go along with the majority.

536
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,923
That's the democratic way.

537
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,679
And personally speaking,
I was very hurt

538
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,428
to see you step out of line
with them others.

539
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:10,272
Still, that's all over now.
We won't bring that up again.

540
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,234
What we've got to do now
is to show a united front.

541
00:35:14,571 --> 00:35:16,904
You made a mistake,
you've been big enough to admit it.

542
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,904
I mean, I'd be the last person in the world
to hold that against you.

543
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:24,074
I wouldn't come round here
and threaten you or anything like that.

544
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,537
No, I'm glad about that.

545
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,577
But I don't mind telling you,

546
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:31,123
I've had a bit of trouble with some of the
boys down there. They don't like scabbing.

547
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,914
Some of them were talking about
getting quite rough.

548
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:39,795
- It went a bit further than talking, didn't it?
- How do you mean?

549
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:44,678
- They set fire to any good cars lately?
- Oh, I don't know anything about that.

550
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,766
No, maybe not.

551
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,682
But I'd just like to make one point.

552
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,556
I got a couple of kids in there, fast asleep.

553
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,900
They were in there when Mother Jackson
got a brick through her window.

554
00:35:55,028 --> 00:35:56,735
That wasn't meant for her,
that was meant for me!

555
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,651
- It could have come in there!
- I tell you, I don't know nothing about that.

556
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:02,696
No, well, I'll put it in another way, Bert.

557
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:05,319
You didn't get a brick
through <i>your</i> window, did you?

558
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:09,077
- What does that prove?
- I'm just telling you...

559
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:11,952
Anyone interferes with my wife and kids,

560
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,376
and I'll start chucking a few bricks around.

561
00:36:15,507 --> 00:36:16,839
So, don't come it.

562
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,958
Nobody's coming it, Tom,
now, don't get excited.

563
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:21,051
I'm not getting excited.

564
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,594
Only, this is my home, not the factory,
so don't you nor anybody else forget it.

565
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,513
I joined your bloody strike, so you won,
so what else do you wanna say?

566
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:31,972
I'm not saying anything,
one way or another.

567
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:35,441
What you want to remember in future,
you or any other blackleg,

568
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,026
is that you won't always get off this easy.

569
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,445
We goy ways, mate, we got ways.

570
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,483
- And I don't just mean broken windows.
- You got what?

571
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,986
- Let's leave it at that.
- No. You got ways of what?

572
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:50,286
- I'm just telling you for your own...
- What are you telling me?

573
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,330
Don't give me that lip, mate, not here.
I pay the rent here.

574
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:56,044
You're very generous with your advice
these days, aren't you?

575
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,504
- Tom!
- Real generous!

576
00:36:57,632 --> 00:37:00,796
- Tom, please!
- Keep out of it, Annie! Just keep out of it!

577
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,635
Come round here, laying down the law.

578
00:37:03,763 --> 00:37:06,506
Well, it so happens you're not the law,
Mr God-Almighty-Connolly, mate.

579
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,674
And I decide whether I go back or not.

580
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:11,928
Not because you tell me,
because I decide, see?

581
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:15,352
So, you can stick your advice!
It don't mean a thing to me.

582
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,190
Doesn't it?

583
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,934
We'll see about that.

584
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:22,188
I'll have that some other time, Mrs Curtis.
Good night!

585
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:30,113
- Come in here, telling me...
- What started all this?

586
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,706
Nothing! Don't ask questions.
You don't understand.

587
00:37:32,834 --> 00:37:34,871
I know what I've heard.
I'm not deaf.

588
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:37,837
- Joe, what do you think?
- Oh, he don't think any bloody thing!

589
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,422
You keep your big, idle trap shut,
don't you, Joe?

590
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:43,839
One of these days,
you're gonna sit so hard on that fence,

591
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,304
you're gonna split yourself
right up the middle!

592
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:51,721
I'll tell you what you gotta face up to,
all of you.

593
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,561
I'll tell you the facts of life.
You can't have it both ways.

594
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:58,308
- Mind if I help myself, Charlie?
- No, no, no, go on.

595
00:37:58,443 --> 00:38:00,560
No good breezing up here
on your expense accounts

596
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:04,530
and then behaving like a lot of shocked
parsons at a dirty postcard convention.

597
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,819
You don't get offered
a government contract every day,

598
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,738
not on this sort of level.

599
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,987
It's the biggest deal
we've ever had a smell of.

600
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,535
And we can't even consider it
until the men are back again.

601
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:16,249
So, to get them back
you got to make concessions.

602
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,994
Now,
what do the concessions amount to?

603
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,544
Extra safety precautions,
a few new toilets,

604
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:25,167
and a face-saver
on the closed-shop angle.

605
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,965
That'll get the machines running again.

606
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,759
Once they're back and back on overtime,
you won't hear any more.

607
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,053
You mean, you <i>hope</i>
you won't hear any more.

608
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,598
Now, listen.
I know men, believe me.

609
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,345
So, make up your minds.

610
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:38,564
You want that contract,
you gotta water your beer.

611
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:42,352
This is the Pakistan contract,
isn't it?

612
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,444
Look, Alfie, why don't you
get into your Bentley

613
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:47,485
and power-steer yourself back to London -
it's past your bedtime.

614
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:50,610
Pakistan!
We finished that job last Christmas!

615
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:54,455
Oh well, I vote we take this other thing,
whatever it is.

616
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,424
Who do you think you are?

617
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,640
He'll have to be taught a lesson.

618
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,718
But a mean a <i>real</i> lesson.

619
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:21,064
That Curtis on his own?
What's his game?

620
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,603
No idea!

621
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:25,978
No. Funny fellow.

622
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:29,107
My wife's never forgiven him
for marrying that Italian girl.

623
00:39:29,242 --> 00:39:31,529
What's her name? Anna.

624
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:34,779
We brought her over, you know -
best girl we ever had.

625
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:37,489
No... he's a funny fellow.

626
00:39:38,585 --> 00:39:41,077
I don't like lone wolves on either side.

627
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,299
Oh, ta.

628
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:52,422
I don't know what Curtis is out to prove,
but he could've saved himself the trouble.

629
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,470
- They'll all be back shortly.
- Oh?

630
00:39:55,602 --> 00:39:57,719
I thought that would shake you.

631
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,523
- Here, I'm not alight.
- Sorry.

632
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:06,985
I've prepared a statement here
for you to give to Connolly.

633
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,070
You'll see what I'm getting at.

634
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,193
Yes, yes, changes the whole set-up.

635
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:17,367
Oh, sure, Martindale knows
which side his bread's buttered.

636
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:20,787
Exactly, ICBM, the magic letters.

637
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:22,706
How will who take it?

638
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,330
Oh, I can handle Connolly.
He's still fighting the general strike.

639
00:40:26,466 --> 00:40:28,708
Yes, amateur night.

640
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:30,425
Well, that's it then.

641
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:34,297
I'll get them to go back, then we can
get them out again at the right moment.

642
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,424
You bet. Yeah.

643
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,022
Hello? Yes, speaking.

644
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,277
Oh, is that you, Phil?
I was going to get on to you.

645
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:52,489
What do you think about Martindale's
offer? He can stick that, can't he?

646
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,200
Accept? Yes, but...

647
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:58,909
Oh, I see.
You've been on to London, have you?

648
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,578
Yeah, but it's not like them
to take it all that easy, is it?

649
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,668
No, but, you see, London take the view
that we've done very...

650
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:07,755
well, that <i>you've</i> done
very nicely so far, and...

651
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:10,590
Yeah... yeah, told me to tell you.

652
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,005
And even though these concessions
don't amount to much,

653
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,254
it means that Martindale's seen the light.

654
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,756
That's it.

655
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,053
They'll have to listen to you now.

656
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:20,972
Oh, the sooner the better,
I should think.

657
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,346
Call a meeting for tomorrow night.

658
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,643
Oh, and by the way,

659
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,562
I've had an idea about Curtis.

660
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,619
- Bit naughty, wasn't it?
- What, Curtis?

661
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,488
- Yeah.
- Suppose so.

662
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:43,616
- Still, nothing we can do about it now.
- No.

663
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,617
Pint of bitter, Bertie.

664
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,166
- Do you mind?
- Take it easy!

665
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:49,788
- You over there!
- No!

666
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,132
Set the alarm for the morning.
Pint of bitter.

667
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,671
Yeah, we're going back.

668
00:41:53,803 --> 00:41:55,544
Come on, luv!

669
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,888
- You're a friend of Curtis, ain't you?
- That's right.

670
00:41:58,016 --> 00:41:59,302
Better give him the message.

671
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:00,891
- What message?
- Wait a minute!

672
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,821
Hey!

673
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:22,079
Hey, you lot!
Hey, got your boots?

674
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,956
- Well, she said I was the first.
- She said what?

675
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,333
Don't give me that!
We've all been there.

676
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,175
Over here!

677
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,477
Come on, let's have some.

678
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,110
- Do you hear someone speak, Gladys?
- No, never heard nothing.

679
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:37,571
Never mind the jokes.
Come on!

680
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:39,655
All right, put some down there.

681
00:43:39,784 --> 00:43:41,366
Down where?

682
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,656
Oh, down there!

683
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:47,156
What are you playing at, Gladys?
You're a bit obstructive this morning.

684
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,657
Naughty girl!

685
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:52,975
Over here, Bill!

686
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,324
You're late!

687
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,622
Am I?

688
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,883
Now, don't tell me
I've given you too much.

689
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:24,719
You need it now you're expecting again.

690
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:29,303
Joe was telling me
everybody was glad to be back today.

691
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,471
Was he?

692
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:33,061
Mm-hmm.
I bet old Martindale was pleased, too.

693
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,602
I know I was.
I was out shopping today,

694
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:38,476
and you should have heard
what the wives were saying.

695
00:45:49,205 --> 00:45:50,741
You're very quiet tonight.

696
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:53,907
Am I?

697
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:56,410
It's been a quiet day.

698
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,047
Come on, have another.

699
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:10,925
- No, thanks, not when you're driving.
- What are you talking about?

700
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:13,347
- Could I have a word with you, Joe?
- Yeah, have a drink.

701
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,017
Er... you know, a word with <i>you.</i>

702
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,481
Oh, all right.
Mind your nylons.

703
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,981
- 'Ere! Don't run away!
- What, in these shoes?

704
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,155
Well, what's up?

705
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,240
Well, we were talking about Tom.

706
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:31,320
- Oh, yeah?
- You know him better than anybody.

707
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:33,788
Well, you room with him, I mean, so...

708
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:36,033
Well, we were talking about
the football side of it.

709
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:39,627
Yeah, we've missed a couple of matches
already, you know, with being out and that.

710
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:43,169
Yeah, that's right. Well, the point is,
who's gonna run it now if Tom doesn't?

711
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,884
Well, there's no "if", is there?
I mean...

712
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:50,632
Can't ignore a bloke all day for scabbing
and kick a ball round with him after hours.

713
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,304
- There's no "if".
- No, that's right.

714
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:57,476
- I mean, we got to sort it out somehow.
- Look, do you mind if I butt in?

715
00:46:57,606 --> 00:46:59,814
Look, Joe. Let's be honest, eh?

716
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,774
I mean, you're like me.

717
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:05,521
I don't care what a man does,
you know, religion and that -

718
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,273
I've got some very good friends,
they're Jews and that...

719
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:13,370
And politics, you know, but...
well, this is a special sort of situation.

720
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:17,958
- Yeah, and another thing...
- Look... mind if I put what I wanna say?

721
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:23,626
Look, Joe, I know Tom,
and I agree with him in some ways, but...

722
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:27,468
well, we got the team to think of,
and the season's underway, and...

723
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:29,177
well, somebody ought to talk to him.

724
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:33,007
I'm only saying this
for the good of the team, mind.

725
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:35,225
You want me to tell him, do you?

726
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,062
- Well, not tell him exactly...
- Yeah, tell him!

727
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:48,564
- What are you doing out of bed, boy?
- My heart's stopped.

728
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,943
Has it? Well, you've done verywell
to get this far then, haven't you? Hmm?

729
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,196
You've done the trick, anyway -
it's started again.

730
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,288
You must have shook it up,
like your watch.

731
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:59,328
Go on, back to bed.
Quick, quick, quick.

732
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:05,039
Sleep well.

733
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:10,093
- What is it?
- Brian having a bad dream.

734
00:48:10,221 --> 00:48:12,383
Don't think it'll make
any difference to them, do you?

735
00:48:12,515 --> 00:48:14,472
You don't know what kids pick up.

736
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:17,009
Seen the doctor yet, by the way?

737
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,353
Oh, there's plenty of time for that.
What else happened today?

738
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:22,643
That's about it.
They're just not talking to me.

739
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:24,812
Didn't Joe talk to you?

740
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:26,901
No.

741
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:29,612
You mean to say...

742
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,699
- Who decides these things anyway?
- What?

743
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,659
- Who decides...
- Well, the men decide.

744
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,779
- What men?
- Just the men, all of them.

745
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:39,247
You mean to tell me that
they decide to treat you like...

746
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:41,367
Doesn't anybody get up
and say how stupid this is?

747
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,789
I wasn't at the meeting,
so I don't know what was said.

748
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,163
Who thought of it?
That's what I want to know.

749
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,665
The committee, I suppose,
Connolly and that lot.

750
00:48:48,801 --> 00:48:50,667
- You mean the union?
- No, not the union.

751
00:48:50,803 --> 00:48:53,090
They're not the whole union.
I'm the union as much as they are.

752
00:48:53,222 --> 00:48:56,511
- Who decides then? Somebody must...
- Look, Annie, I don't know!

753
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:04,269
I don't know who thought of it
or who decided it or anything. All I...

754
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,693
I'm sorry I shouted.
All I know is they're not talking to me.

755
00:49:10,823 --> 00:49:13,440
Nobody's talking,
not even old Billy Arkwright.

756
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:18,745
- What are they scared of?
- I don't know. They're just scared.

757
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,956
Doesn't do to step out of line these days.

758
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:23,541
We're all so equal, we're nothing.

759
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,293
Huh!
Remember that case in the paper?

760
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,007
Remember? I read it out to you.

761
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,297
- Railwayman, wasn't it?
- Oh, yes.

762
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,886
I though then...

763
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:37,051
I wonder what it's like.

764
00:49:38,726 --> 00:49:40,433
Well, now we know.

765
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:45,848
Do... do they do it for a time,
or what happens?

766
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,396
Well, I don't remember that case exactly,
but I...

767
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,985
I think they kept it up for quite a while.

768
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:55,024
How long? A week or two?

769
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,736
Uh... a bit longer, I think.

770
00:50:00,789 --> 00:50:02,530
I think they kept it up for quite a bit.

771
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,108
Anna gone to bed?

772
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,602
Yeah.

773
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:41,695
I haven't done mine this week.

774
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,295
Fag?

775
00:50:54,051 --> 00:50:55,838
Yeah, ta.

776
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:05,135
I'm sorry about all this.

777
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:06,933
What are you sorry about?

778
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:08,771
Talking about you or me?

779
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,891
Well, you of course!

780
00:51:16,282 --> 00:51:19,775
Look, I... I know
what you must be thinking. Well...

781
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:21,742
I don't like trouble, see?

782
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:26,786
I mean, I wasn't at the meeting.
I didn't vote or anything like that.

783
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,581
But you know how it is -
they... they get at you.

784
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:32,750
Well, you can't go against all of them.

785
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:34,292
Yeah, I noticed that myself.

786
00:51:34,425 --> 00:51:37,668
Well, there you are!
I mean, where's it all got you?

787
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,510
The point is,
you've got to live with them,

788
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,096
so what's the use sticking your neck out
all the time?

789
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:45,888
I mean, I don't wanna go into
the rights and wrongs of it all, but...

790
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,979
once it happens, you know,
you're better to fall in with them.

791
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:51,393
I mean,
they're all a bunch of twits anyway.

792
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,268
Yeah, I'm sorry, Joe,
I'm still not quite there -

793
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:57,316
best that <i>you</i>
should fall in with them or me?

794
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:59,531
Well... well, both.

795
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:04,073
I mean, I don't get anything out of it -
been feeling lousy ever since it happened.

796
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,947
Well, you can stop feeling lousy
on my account.

797
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:10,500
I'm glad you finally talked about it,
anyway.

798
00:52:10,628 --> 00:52:11,960
Yeah, well, I was asked...

799
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:16,881
Oh, you were asked?

800
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:21,253
Well, not exactly, but...

801
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:25,723
well, some of the what-you-call-it, the...
the football team, they wanted to...

802
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:29,640
You see, they're a bit worried
about the fixtures and that.

803
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:31,642
In what way?

804
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,147
Well, apparently... I mean,
you know more about it than I do,

805
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,487
but a couple of the matches
had to be scrubbed, didn't they? And...

806
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,074
Well, the team's got a bit anxious
or something.

807
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:46,160
I see. And?

808
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:49,656
Well, the reason they picked me to tell you
is cos I live here, I suppose.

809
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,493
Tell me what?

810
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:55,416
They want you to take a back seat.

811
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,720
Joe's been telling me some news,
haven't you, Joe?

812
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,429
Really?

813
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:08,049
Did he make sure
all the doors were locked first?

814
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,144
You never know, do you, Joe -
somebody might be spying on you.

815
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,888
They might find out that you've
actually spoken to Tom Curtis.

816
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,140
All right, all right...

817
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,392
No, it's not all right.
It's not all right at all!

818
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:20,020
He can't have it both ways,
and if you won't tell him, I will!

819
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,272
He can't talk to you at work,
he can't talk to you here.

820
00:53:22,408 --> 00:53:25,196
- He had something to tell me.
- Yes, like "how are you" or "goodbye".

821
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,944
Leave it, Annie.
This is between Joe and me.

822
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:32,120
No, it's not. This is my house, too, and
I've had all I can take from Mr Wallace.

823
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:36,211
- Look, you'll wake the kids!
- I'll wake Mr Joe bloody Wallace, too!

824
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,580
Look, this is a home, not a morgue.

825
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:41,083
People talk in homes.
They speak to each other.

826
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,130
They say "good morning"
and "good night".

827
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:46,972
They don't treat their friends like they have
some sort of a disease or something.

828
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,886
What was so special
he had to tell you tonight

829
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:50,724
he couldn't have told you this morning?

830
00:53:50,853 --> 00:53:53,561
What was so special, huh?
Look, you'd better look at me!

831
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,396
You went out of this house this morning,

832
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:59,518
you couldn't even bring yourself
to say hello to me, let alone my husband.

833
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,896
Well, I want to tell you something.
I don't work at your rotten factory,

834
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,365
and I don't belong to your little committees
and your little unions.

835
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,530
And nobody's gonna send <i>me</i>
to Coventry!

836
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:12,326
I don't want you here anymore.
I don't want you near me or my children!

837
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,700
I don't want you here
in this house anymore!

838
00:54:14,835 --> 00:54:17,418
- Now, look, Annie, shut up, will you?
- You know something?

839
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,584
I feel sorry for you.
You can't even think for yourself.

840
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:22,252
Look, Annie, stop it!
I'm sorry, Joe.

841
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:25,752
Yes, you're sorry. You're sorry.
You deserve your friends!

842
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,980
Yeah, that's all I needed today.

843
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:45,363
Well, look, maybe I'd better clear out -
be best for everybody.

844
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,556
Mr Curtis?

845
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,181
My name's Ball, I'm from the <i>A rgus.</i>

846
00:55:17,064 --> 00:55:18,100
Oh yeah?

847
00:55:18,232 --> 00:55:21,066
Sorry to spring at you so early,
but I wanted to be sure of catching you.

848
00:55:21,193 --> 00:55:23,901
Er... about this business
over at the factory-

849
00:55:24,029 --> 00:55:25,736
I understand you've been sent to Coventry

850
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:28,106
over some difference with
the works committee, is that correct?

851
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:29,278
Something like that, yeah.

852
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:32,906
You didn't come out on strike,
did you, Mr Curtis?

853
00:55:33,038 --> 00:55:35,781
- No.
- Why was that then?

854
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:37,157
I had personal reasons.

855
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:40,205
You didn't agree with the strike,
in other words. Can I say that?

856
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:41,373
No, I didn't agree.

857
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:45,169
You thought it was all rather unnecessary,
shall we say?

858
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,632
That's fine.

859
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:49,969
Erm... one other thing -
how do you feel now?

860
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:54,007
- In what way?
- Well, I mean, about your workmates.

861
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,723
Well, it's difficult to say.

862
00:55:57,855 --> 00:56:02,475
I don't understand it, really,
be different if the union had fined me.

863
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,726
I see. You feel that
you've been persecuted

864
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:08,355
- Well, I wouldn't say persecuted...
- Don't you think it's unfair?

865
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:11,282
Well, yes, I... I do, really.

866
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,697
Same thing, really, isn't it?

867
00:56:13,829 --> 00:56:17,243
Right, well, thank you, Mr Curtis,
you've been very helpful.

868
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,866
Hope I haven't made you too late.

869
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:24,958
- Who was that?
- Some bloke from the <i>A rgus.</i>

870
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:27,332
- What did he want?
- Wanted to know what I felt about it.

871
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:29,254
- What did you tell him?
- Told him the truth.

872
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,005
"The truth according to Tom Curtis

873
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,723
"is that he has been... been..."

874
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,138
Let me see that!

875
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,602
- "...has been victimised..."
- Yeah, that's right.

876
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:45,646
"...by those responsible

877
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,394
"for an unnecessary and unreasonable
withdrawal of labour

878
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:50,692
"which did not have union backing."

879
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:53,282
- He's begging for it, isn't he?
- Yeah.

880
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:54,400
Read the rest.

881
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,994
Read further down, about old Martindale.
He had something to say.

882
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,785
Bit unfortunate?
It's a bloody sight worse than that!

883
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:02,830
They got on to me last night.
I told them it was off the record.

884
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,203
- Well, what do you want me to do?
- What do I want you to do?

885
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:08,377
Kill it! Get after Connolly
and get it sorted out.

886
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:11,592
If you have to, get rid of Curtis.

887
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,053
I don't care... but kill it!

888
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,764
Yeah, all right, the old man's upset.

889
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:18,679
Everybody's upset.

890
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,096
Well, they've got a right to be.

891
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,392
Let's not talk about rights, shall we?
Let's keep the conversation clean.

892
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,518
I just want to make sure
that this thing doesn't go any further.

893
00:57:28,654 --> 00:57:31,271
Well, that's easy enough - sack Curtis!

894
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,240
Couldn't you just as easily
stop this Coventry business?

895
00:57:34,368 --> 00:57:37,861
You've had your fun. Call it a day now,
and the papers got nothing to write about.

896
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,955
- What do you mean, "fun"?
- What I say.

897
00:57:41,083 --> 00:57:43,120
What do you call it? Justice?

898
00:57:43,251 --> 00:57:46,415
All right, justice then, I don't care.
Call it what you like, but finish it.

899
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,629
I can't finish it.
It's not my decision.

900
00:57:48,757 --> 00:57:51,795
- I'm only a spokesman for the men.
- Don't give me that guff, Bert.

901
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:55,011
You're slipping these days, you know,
you're treating me like an equal.

902
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:56,379
You can stop it.

903
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:59,428
Well, maybe I could have
stopped it before, but not now.

904
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:01,016
The men didn't like that article.

905
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,888
What is it?
A few words in a local rag.

906
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,857
It'll end up on a nail in the toilet,
or somebody'll make a fire with it.

907
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:09,601
What are they all
getting so excited about?

908
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,272
They took it very personally.

909
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,319
Well, do me a favour, use your influence.
Tell 'em not to take it personally.

910
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,318
- I don't care...
- I took it personally, too!

911
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:21,412
It practically mentioned me by name.
I don't like that.

912
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,247
Don't tell me you're getting a lawyer.

913
00:58:23,375 --> 00:58:25,662
Curtis is a blackleg,
and I don't want him here.

914
00:58:28,964 --> 00:58:31,581
Well, let me tell you something.
You don't run this factory yet,

915
00:58:31,717 --> 00:58:34,585
and while I'm works manager,
I decide who gets the push.

916
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,428
And it's gonna take more than
a few paragraphs in the <i>A rgus</i>

917
00:58:37,556 --> 00:58:39,593
to make me give Curtis his cards.

918
00:58:39,725 --> 00:58:42,718
And I'll tell you something else
you can take personally.

919
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,015
I don't like what you're doing.

920
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:48,891
You'd better get that lawyer -
you might need him one day!

921
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,981
I'll remember you said that, Davis.

922
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:56,072
"Mr Davis" while you're still talking to me!

923
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,835
Well, they look happy enough.

924
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,795
What are their names?

925
00:59:11,923 --> 00:59:14,461
Brian and Cathy... Catherine.

926
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:17,627
Nice-looking kids.

927
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,506
Do you mind if we borrow this for a while?
We'll let you have it back safely.

928
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,132
Get you some copies made.

929
00:59:23,268 --> 00:59:26,352
Tell me, Mrs Curtis,
you're not English, are you?

930
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,813
- No, Italian.
- Italian, huh?

931
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,523
And what's your Christian name?
I might as well have that, too.

932
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,893
- Anna.
- Not Gina.

933
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,274
It's a nice name. It suits you.

934
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,523
I knew a girl called Anna once.

935
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:42,781
Excuse me asking, but somebody told me
you are in fact expecting another edition.

936
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,324
Is that right?

937
00:59:44,456 --> 00:59:47,415
- Yes.
- Well, congratulations.

938
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,159
- What's all this for?
- Oh, thank you.

939
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:53,038
Well, it's just that a lot of people
are interested in your story,

940
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:56,962
that's why they sent me all this way.
We like to get the woman's angle.

941
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,007
- You're not gonna write anything bad?
- What's that?

942
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,380
You're not gonna write anything bad?

943
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,148
What's for breakfast?

944
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,823
Why don't they sack him?

945
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,412
Why don't you sack me then?

946
01:01:08,540 --> 01:01:11,283
If Mr Martindale feels so strongly about it,
why doesn't he sack me?

947
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:15,037
Don't think he hasn't thought of it!
We're not gonna sack you.

948
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:18,210
That'd really give the papers
something to write about.

949
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:22,335
All he wants you to do is apologise to
the works committee, finish it, kill it dead.

950
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:24,132
Would you apologise?

951
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,381
- We're not talking about me.
- No, but I'm asking you.

952
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:29,558
I don't know what I'd do.

953
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,145
I wouldn't have got myself where you are in
the first place. But I'll tell you this much:

954
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,016
I'd think of a way to finish it,
and I'd finish it soon.

955
01:01:36,151 --> 01:01:40,145
Soon? What's the use of "soon"?
We've got to finish it now!

956
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,647
We're committed, you know that.
I've signed the contract.

957
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:45,616
But they've got a get-out clause, and
they'll use it if we have any more trouble.

958
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:47,155
They can't afford delays.

959
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,871
- I still think it'll blow over.
- You said that last time.

960
01:01:50,999 --> 01:01:52,661
I mean, what are we gonna do?

961
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,249
You say you can't sack him,

962
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,791
he won't apologise, they won't back down,
and we're right in the bloody middle.

963
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:01,416
And I'm not going to lose business
because of one man. Life's too short!

964
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,588
And what's your opinion?

965
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,428
- What about?
- Can you stand back, please?

966
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,969
You're one of the men
who sent Tom Curtis to Coventry.

967
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,217
In a way, yeah.

968
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:14,972
Are you proud of this evidence of solidarity
among the men who work here,

969
01:02:15,106 --> 01:02:18,599
or ae you ashamed of what
a lot of people regard as a cruel act?

970
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,101
Am I...

971
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:23,401
Look, you'd better ask somebody else.
Nothing to do with me.

972
01:02:25,075 --> 01:02:27,032
You three work here, do you?

973
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:30,403
- No, we're the owners.
- Ol' Eddie!

974
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:31,870
Let me ask "old Eddie",

975
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:35,082
what do you expect to achieve
by sending this man to Coventry?

976
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:39,750
Or is there any pleasure in inflicting this
punishment on one of your work mates?

977
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:43,249
Yeah, I'll tell you what I expect to achieve.
I think he deserves it.

978
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:45,547
Do you think he deserves it?

979
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:51,175
Well, um... like he says, um...
Curtis asked for it.

980
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,551
As I understand it,
this was an unofficial strike,

981
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:56,225
so Curtis was quite within his rights
in refusing to come out.

982
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,018
No, I don't think so.

983
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,142
You'd make no distinction between
an official and an unofficial strike?

984
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,315
- No.
- You'd always come out?

985
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,440
- Yeah, when they tell us to.
- When who tells you to?

986
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:10,534
Er... the men and that.

987
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:14,038
What men? Would you come out
if <i>he</i> told you?

988
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,411
I never told him.

989
01:03:17,544 --> 01:03:19,831
But you were at the meeting
at which it was decided

990
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,125
to send Tom Curtis to Coventry?

991
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:26,884
- Yeah, I was there, yeah.
- Did you vote to do that?

992
01:03:27,012 --> 01:03:28,344
Yeah, I put my hand up, yeah.

993
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:32,556
Did you know what putting your hand up
would mean to Tom Curtis?

994
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:38,975
Do you always vote when you don't know
what you're voting for?

995
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,024
Well, if he doesn't know,
let me ask you.

996
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:45,645
What makes you decide
how you're going to vote?

997
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:51,701
Well, er... it depends, don't it,
what they're gonna give us.

998
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,538
'To find out what action the employer

Oh, yes, yes.

- Where?
- Brisbane. Australia, isn't it?

1029
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:43,225
Erm... a man named Fraser -
he owns a factory out there.

- Yeah, if you want to live in Australia.

1033
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:59,282
Well, I mean,
it was nice of him to offer.

1034
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:02,703
I can't believe it,
all these people writing to us.

1035
01:06:02,834 --> 01:06:05,793
Some of the people
stop me in the street, too.

1036
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,288
Oh, I mean to tell you -
you know Mr Booth at the grocer's?

1037
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:12,667
He slipped in a bottle of lemon squash
for the children and didn't charge me.

1038
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:14,259
Probably made a mistake.

1039
01:06:14,387 --> 01:06:16,925
No, he meant it,
I know he meant it.

1040
01:06:17,891 --> 01:06:20,759
Well, of course
they're not all on our side, so...

1041
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:22,886
What am I gonna do, Annie?

1042
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,433
What am I gonna do?

1043
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:31,981
What do they want from me?

1044
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,239
I suppose they want you to
give up and get out.

1045
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,242
Is that what you want, too?

1046
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:48,457
Tear everything up a second time
and start all over again?

1047
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,044
No, I don't want that.

1048
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:56,843
I mean, I don't know.

1049
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:59,714
I only want what you want, I suppose.

1050
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:16,271
Here you are, darling, catch.

1051
01:07:19,536 --> 01:07:21,619
- Where is Brian?
- What?

1052
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:22,782
Don't say "what".

1053
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:24,780
- Why isn't Brian with you?
- Don't know!

1054
01:07:30,463 --> 01:07:33,376
- Who's slamming about?
- Come on. Come on, quickly.

1055
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:36,797
- Sorry Mrs Jackson, just the wind.
- I know who it was all right.

1056
01:07:36,928 --> 01:07:39,341
I told never to slam it before.

1057
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,680
- Where's Brian?
- I told you!

1058
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:44,425
Wasn't he waiting for you, Cathy?

1059
01:07:44,561 --> 01:07:46,848
Look at me. Wasn't Brian
waiting for you at the gate?

1060
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:48,016
No.

1061
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:50,890
- Well, did you wait for him?
- He didn't wait for me.

1062
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,688
Oh, Cathy. Cathy, look at me,
I'm talking to you.

1063
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,233
Did you ask any of the other boys
if they saw him?

1064
01:07:56,364 --> 01:07:57,400
No.

1065
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:59,819
Well, you know you're supposed
to wait for each other.

1066
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:03,535
How could I wait for him
when he wasn't waiting for me?

1067
01:08:03,663 --> 01:08:05,825
All right, you start your tea.

1068
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:09,082
I'm going to the corner.

1069
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:12,328
Now, there's one cake each,
and I shan't be long. You'll be all right.

1070
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:15,376
You can have some biscuits,
but just one cake, all right?

1071
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:17,044
All right?

1072
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:22,637
I shan't be long.

1073
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,030
Brian! Brian?

1074
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:30,705
Brian?

1075
01:10:04,992 --> 01:10:06,699
How is he now?

1076
01:10:06,828 --> 01:10:10,117
I had to put him in our bedroom
because of Cathy.

1077
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,535
I couldn't get it off, Tom.

1078
01:10:12,667 --> 01:10:17,537
I mean, I got most of it off with that
stuff we have in the kitchen, but...

1079
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:20,506
- It was just like tar.
- He say who did it?

1080
01:10:20,633 --> 01:10:25,253
Huh? Oh, some boys, some bigger boys,
in the next class.

1081
01:10:25,388 --> 01:10:27,755
I carried him all the way home.

1082
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,802
You shouldn't have done that.

1083
01:10:32,687 --> 01:10:35,350
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to see him.

1084
01:10:35,481 --> 01:10:38,440
- Oh, please don't.
- What do you mean? I gotta see him.

1085
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:47,778
Brian?

1086
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:51,537
He's asleep, Tom.
Let him sleep.

1087
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,406
You asleep, boy?

1088
01:10:57,545 --> 01:10:59,662
It all right, boy, it's Dad.

1089
01:11:02,175 --> 01:11:03,837
You aren't asleep, are you?

1090
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,173
Why won't you talk to me?

1091
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:16,178
Because you're a dirty scab!

1092
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,289
Shut up!

1093
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,002
Shut up, will you?

1094
01:12:44,735 --> 01:12:47,603
You don't have to worry about
not talking to me.

1095
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:49,695
I don't want you to talk to me,
do you hear?

1096
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,326
But you stay away from my family.

1097
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,534
Just stay away from us!

1098
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:06,330
Get stuffed, short-arse!

1099
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,668
And you lot,

1100
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:15,343
you didn't ought to talk to nobody,
cos you got nothing to say!

1101
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:16,715
You're nothing!

1102
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:24,389
We don't need any of you!

1103
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:39,155
We don't need you.

1104
01:14:08,611 --> 01:14:11,729
- You going to the dance on Friday night?
- No.

1105
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:14,860
Mr Curtis?

1106
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:17,359
Mr Curtis, you all right?

1107
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:19,361
- Feeling all right?
- I'm fine.

1108
01:14:19,497 --> 01:14:21,864
- Thought you looked a bit...
- I'm fine, fine...

1109
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:26,410
Joe?

1110
01:14:27,546 --> 01:14:29,833
- What's happened now?
- What about?

1111
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,424
- What's wrong with Tom Curtis?
- Nothing that concerns you.

1112
01:14:32,551 --> 01:14:34,042
- Oh, yes, it does.
- Do you mind?

1113
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,090
I'm asking you a question!
What happened?

1114
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:38,214
Now, look, I'm tired of
people getting on my back.

1115
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:41,433
He brought it on himself.
What do you expect me to do?

1116
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,847
Everyone goes on like if it was my fault.
Well, I didn't start it.

1117
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:45,391
I didn't have nothing to do with it.

1118
01:14:45,523 --> 01:14:47,890
I just mind my own business,
so why don't you do the same?

1119
01:14:48,025 --> 01:14:50,768
Well, you couldn't have an opinion
to save your life.

1120
01:14:50,903 --> 01:14:53,987
You're the big I am. I don't know
why I ever bothered about you.

1121
01:14:54,115 --> 01:14:55,526
You're just like the rest - gutless!

1122
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,445
You haven't got the brains
to stick up for anything.

1123
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:01,285
One man, that's all it needs.

1124
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,121
One man!

1125
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,036
Is it all right to talk?

1126
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:06,203
Good.

1127
01:15:06,335 --> 01:15:09,043
First thing,
you got any instructions for me?

1128
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,332
Right. Now, listen.

1129
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:13,423
The reason I asked you to ring is,
something happened here today.

1130
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:16,635
No. No, concerning Curtis. Yeah.

1131
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:19,550
And it occurred to me
that if the time's ripe all round,

1132
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,969
we've got it ready-made up here.

1133
01:15:22,101 --> 01:15:24,263
We use Curtis to get them out again.

1134
01:15:24,395 --> 01:15:26,808
That will screw up this whole contract.

1135
01:15:26,939 --> 01:15:31,149
Sure... about seven factories
all dependent on Martindale's.

1136
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,394
Oh, it'll work a treat, you'll see.

1137
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:35,816
Curtis really played
right into my hands today.

1138
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:43,407
Connolly!

1139
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:46,122
Connolly! Up here a minute!

1140
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,331
- What's happening?
- What's happening about what?

1141
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,299
These production returns.

1142
01:15:56,427 --> 01:15:59,010
No. 2 shift in 4 Bay -
they retired or something?

1143
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,800
No, they're working to rule.

1144
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:03,010
Since when?

1145
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,974
Decision was taken
by the works committee.

1146
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:08,812
We're operating a full overtime ban
until the management get rid of Curtis.

1147
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,228
Oh, so we're back on that one again,
are we?

1148
01:16:12,359 --> 01:16:15,602
What are you frightened of?
You afraid Curtis might win in the end?

1149
01:16:15,738 --> 01:16:18,856
- No, we're not worried about that.
- Aren't you?

1150
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:22,572
Well, I'll give you a little thought
to take away with you.

1151
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:25,571
Once you start sacking people
because they don't agree with you,

1152
01:16:25,706 --> 01:16:28,414
or because you don't like the way
they part their hair,

1153
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:32,001
once you establish that little precedent,
you might give other people ideas.

1154
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:35,293
It might just occur to me that you're not
<i>my</i> cup of tea, for instance.

1155
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:37,416
There's no telling where it might end.

1156
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:40,635
- Quite a few people might get sacked.
- Are you threatening me?

1157
01:16:40,763 --> 01:16:43,380
Take it any way you like.
Now, just get out, will you?

1158
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:57,019
He said there'd be
quite a few people sacked.

1159
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:01,273
What's up?

1160
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,071
- Don't know yet?
- Gonna close down.

1161
01:17:04,203 --> 01:17:05,614
Who says?

1162
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:07,988
You heard. Davis told ol' Connolly.

1163
01:17:08,124 --> 01:17:10,081
It's victimisation, you know?

1164
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:12,417
Yeah... what is?

1165
01:17:12,545 --> 01:17:14,628
They're gonna make an example.

1166
01:17:14,755 --> 01:17:17,338
Sack a few.
That's what I was told.

1167
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:20,254
I didn't hear about that.
Sack 'em?

1168
01:17:20,386 --> 01:17:21,627
That's what somebody told me.

1169
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:25,881
I want to speak to the Union Secretary.

1170
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,008
Well, who is there?

1171
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,511
Has he got any authority?
I don't want the office boy.

1172
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:42,068
I told you to sort this out.
But no.

1173
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:45,783
You said it would blow over.
Well, things don't blow over anymore.

1174
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:48,995
Should have sacked Curtis the moment
this Coventry business started.

1175
01:17:49,123 --> 01:17:51,740
- Well, that's a matter of opinion, isn't it?
- What?

1176
01:17:51,876 --> 01:17:53,333
Hello?

1177
01:17:53,460 --> 01:17:54,871
Yes, yes, of course it's urgent.

1178
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:57,542
It's more than urgent, I'm afraid.
They're coming out.

1179
01:18:04,388 --> 01:18:06,004
Yes, speaking.

1180
01:18:06,140 --> 01:18:08,723
Who's that? Thompson?

1181
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:12,470
I'm sorry to pull you out of the meeting,
but we've got a wildcat.

1182
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:14,892
I want a union representative
up here right away.

1183
01:18:47,473 --> 01:18:49,339
What do you think you will do then?

1184
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,349
I don't know.

1185
01:18:56,649 --> 01:18:59,187
I prayed for us this evening.

1186
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:03,813
I didn't go to your mother's as I said.
I... I went to mass.

1187
01:19:03,948 --> 01:19:06,406
I thought perhaps it might help.

1188
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,694
You see,
I don't mind if we go away at all.

1189
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:13,162
I mean, Australia, anywhere...

1190
01:19:14,333 --> 01:19:17,041
Somebody told me Australia's very nice.

1191
01:19:17,169 --> 01:19:20,458
Nice people, and it's hot.

1192
01:19:22,341 --> 01:19:24,424
Almost like home.

1193
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:29,637
We could go home, of course.

1194
01:19:29,765 --> 01:19:32,178
Yeah, that's right.

1195
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,427
- This isn't really home for you, is it?
- I didn't mean that.

1196
01:19:35,562 --> 01:19:37,474
No, I know.

1197
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:43,022
I've really messed everything up,
haven't I?

1198
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,440
And I don't even know why.

1199
01:19:46,991 --> 01:19:49,028
But I've got to decide something.

1200
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:51,526
I've just got to, otherwise I'll...

1201
01:19:53,205 --> 01:19:54,821
I don't even know how I got into it.

1202
01:19:54,957 --> 01:19:58,951
You got into it because you thought
that was the right thing.

1203
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,378
Yeah.

1204
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:08,172
Well, I hope that is why, because if
it isn't, we may as well clear out.

1205
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:10,466
We may as well...

1206
01:20:11,515 --> 01:20:14,929
I mean, if people can't be different,
if they take that away from you,

1207
01:20:15,060 --> 01:20:19,225
there's no point to any of it,
no point in bringing up kids or anything.

1208
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,938
Just no point at all.

1209
01:20:24,153 --> 01:20:26,611
The funny thing is,
I can see both sides.

1210
01:20:26,739 --> 01:20:29,356
They must think they're doing right, too.

1211
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,401
That strike you as funny?

1212
01:20:34,872 --> 01:20:37,910
No... not so funny.

1213
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,391
Tom, wait!

1214
01:21:12,117 --> 01:21:14,029
Tom?

1215
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,744
Don't go.

1216
01:21:20,876 --> 01:21:22,788
Please, God, don't go.

1217
01:21:57,162 --> 01:21:59,279
- Come on...
- You're gonna get it!

1218
01:22:03,377 --> 01:22:05,539
Get back! Come on!

1219
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,545
Mr Curtis! Mr Curtis!

1220
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,546
You're still not striking. Why not?

1221
01:22:16,682 --> 01:22:19,174
Nobody told me there was a strike.

1222
01:22:51,049 --> 01:22:52,585
Joe, can I talk to you for a minute?

1223
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,131
- Yeah, pull up a chair.
- I've got to talk to you.

1224
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:58,922
- All right.
- Don't mind me!

1225
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,675
- It's Tom Curtis. He's been hurt.
- What do you mean, "hurt"?

1226
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,394
I don't know the details.
I was working late and the police phoned.

1227
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:07,764
They just said an accident,
wanted his address.

1228
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,267
- Where is he now?
- Up at the hospital, I think.

1229
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:13,102
All right, come on.

1230
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:16,939
In the waiting room, over there.

1231
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,987
Thanks.

1232
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,121
Hello, Anna.

1233
01:23:29,296 --> 01:23:31,003
Hello, Joe.

1234
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:35,292
I, er... I heard the news.

1235
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:39,262
That girl I used to go with,
don't think you ever met her, nice girl, Pat,

1236
01:23:39,389 --> 01:23:40,925
she told me.

1237
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:43,429
You... you all right?

1238
01:23:44,186 --> 01:23:47,770
Just worried about leaving the kids
with Mrs Jackson.

1239
01:23:47,898 --> 01:23:51,141
Oh, well, I could ask Pat to go round
and stay with them for a bit, if you like.

1240
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,858
She's outside.

1241
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,237
Erm... how is he?

1242
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:59,065
They don't know yet, Joe.

1243
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:01,284
Well, they never tell you much, do they?

1244
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:06,782
I mean, even if everything's all right
they seem to like to keep it to themselves.

1245
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:09,625
Expect they have to keep to the rules
or something.

1246
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,710
You sure you're all right?

1247
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,042
They... got any idea what happened?

1248
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:20,511
He was knocked down by a car,
they think.

1249
01:24:20,639 --> 01:24:23,928
- They think they might have to operate.
- Oh!

1250
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:26,176
Well, don't worry.

1251
01:24:26,311 --> 01:24:29,395
No, that's... that's a silly thing to say.
Of course you worry, but...

1252
01:24:29,523 --> 01:24:32,357
Well, they can do wonderful things
these days,

1253
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,942
and you know Tom, he's pretty tough.

1254
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,229
Well...

1255
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,357
I'll go and tell Pat.

1256
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:42,609
Then I could come back
and stay with you.

1257
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:45,828
That is, if you want me to.

1258
01:24:45,956 --> 01:24:49,324
Thank you, Joe.
I'd like you to stay.

1259
01:25:00,679 --> 01:25:03,422
Excuse me.

1260
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:06,174
Mrs Curtis?
Sister would like to see you.

1261
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:08,427
- How is my husband?
- Oh, he came through it verywell.

1262
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:10,303
Sister will tell you about it.

1263
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,768
You, er... you all right now?

1264
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:15,983
Yes, you don't have to wait
any longer, Joe.

1265
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,194
We'll take care of her.

1266
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:30,957
Oh, er... you didn't see
a patient called Curtis, did you, Doctor?

1267
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:34,248
- He was in a car accident.
- I saw him when he came, yes.

1268
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,120
Was he bad?

1269
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,044
- You the driver?
- No, just a friend.

1270
01:25:39,176 --> 01:25:42,135
Well, he's not too good.
Had to lose an eye, I'm afraid.

1271
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,807
Come on, Perce,
what about the old rosy then?

1272
01:25:48,477 --> 01:25:50,093
Cor, dear, what a night!

1273
01:25:50,228 --> 01:25:53,266
- What have you this time?
- Attempted suicide. All over the place.

1274
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:55,390
They never do a good job with a gun.

1275
01:25:56,360 --> 01:26:00,274
Bloke here asking about his pal
in that car crash you brought in earlier.

1276
01:26:04,242 --> 01:26:07,406
Hit and run, the police reckon.
No witnesses either.

1277
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,244
Never is with them bastards.

1278
01:26:09,373 --> 01:26:12,866
He was still conscious when we got there,
but couldn't tell the police nothing though.

1279
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,867
All he was concerned with was Gladys.

1280
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,619
Who's that, his wife?

1281
01:26:16,755 --> 01:26:19,668
- Gladys?
- Yes, kept talking about her.

1282
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,632
No, it's not his wife.

1283
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:24,093
- His wife's name is Anna.
- Oh!

1284
01:26:24,221 --> 01:26:26,554
Well, I never mentioned it to nobody.

1285
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,982
Nurse?

1286
01:26:39,111 --> 01:26:42,024
- Is that you, Nurse?
- Yes.

1287
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:43,987
It's all right, Mr Curtis.

1288
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,535
Could you do something for me?

1289
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:53,872
Don't...

1290
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,492
Don't let my wife know.

1291
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:00,246
Mustn't worry...

1292
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:03,541
Not now.

1293
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:07,796
Mustn't worry...

1294
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:12,307
Having a baby...

1295
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,643
Brothers, please!

1296
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:24,528
Brothers, please,
I call upon you to give a fair hearing

1297
01:27:24,656 --> 01:27:28,400
to Brother Sid Thompson, Chairman...

1298
01:27:28,535 --> 01:27:32,028
Brothers, please hold it in the back.
Please, please!

1299
01:27:33,165 --> 01:27:37,034
Chairman to the union's
negotiating committee.

1300
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,206
Brothers!

1301
01:27:39,337 --> 01:27:44,423
Brothers, I have come specially here
to urge you to return to work...

1302
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:51,381
...and I am confident that between us
we have found an acceptable formula.

1303
01:27:52,476 --> 01:27:53,762
Acceptable to who?

1304
01:27:53,894 --> 01:27:56,011
- Seen Eddie Barrett?
- No, not this morning.

1305
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,766
Acceptable to who?

1306
01:27:57,898 --> 01:28:00,641
Go back to work!
It's in your own interests.

1307
01:28:10,243 --> 01:28:12,360
Hey, Gladys, come here!
I want to talk to you.

1308
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:14,704
- What about?
- About Tom Curtis.

1309
01:28:14,831 --> 01:28:15,992
Get knotted!

1310
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,468
Uh... wasn't me!
I didn't do nothing!

1311
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:39,391
I only kept a lookout!
It was Eddie done it!

1312
01:28:39,523 --> 01:28:42,106
Right. Well, you stay there
if you know what's good for you.

1313
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,653
I'm gonna make sure of you, Barrett,
before the police get you.

1314
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:31,613
What police?
Who are you trying to kid?

1315
01:29:31,741 --> 01:29:34,324
You done Tom Curtis last night,
didn't you?

1316
01:29:34,452 --> 01:29:36,318
You nuts or something?

1317
01:29:36,454 --> 01:29:38,366
You touch me, and I'll carve you!

1318
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:41,286
Is that what you used on Tom Curtis?

1319
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:42,875
I know nothing about Tom Curtis.

1320
01:29:46,131 --> 01:29:48,248
You keep away from me!

1321
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:58,800
I warned you, you keep away from me,
you mad bleeder! Ow!

1322
01:30:03,815 --> 01:30:05,522
Ow!

1323
01:30:07,277 --> 01:30:08,643
Ow!

1324
01:30:12,157 --> 01:30:13,693
- Ow!
- Now!

1325
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:16,317
What don't you know about Tom Curtis?

1326
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:22,578
The only way to tackle this problem
is on an official union basis.

1327
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,368
That's what I'm here for,

1328
01:30:25,503 --> 01:30:27,540
and that's what I'm prepared
to stay here for.

1329
01:30:28,381 --> 01:30:30,794
You are all engaged
on work of national importance.

1330
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:33,213
What about the blokes
who've been sacked, eh?

1331
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:36,179
You keep saying that.
Nobody has been sacked!

1332
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,423
You can't show me a man
who's been sacked!

1333
01:30:39,559 --> 01:30:40,845
Who do you think you are?

1334
01:30:40,977 --> 01:30:44,641
The management have categorically
stated that there have been no sackings.

1335
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:46,355
Go on, get him down!

1336
01:30:49,027 --> 01:30:54,147
There have been wrongs on both sides.

1337
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:55,773
I think we'd better break this up.

1338
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,030
Would you say there's been
outside interference in this strike?

1339
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:04,452
- Yes, definitely!
- Come on now, break it up!

1340
01:31:04,584 --> 01:31:06,917
Mr Thompson, can I quote you?

1341
01:31:07,045 --> 01:31:08,581
Yes, quote me.

1342
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:10,796
What do you know about it,
you ponce?

1343
01:31:10,924 --> 01:31:12,790
You see the sort of chap
I'm fighting for?

1344
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,091
Brothers!

1345
01:31:18,223 --> 01:31:21,341
Brothers, I'm very proud...
very proud indeed...

1346
01:31:22,519 --> 01:31:25,978
- Dan, over here!
- ...a response to our call for unity.

1347
01:31:26,106 --> 01:31:28,644
Stand back, please. Excuse me.

1348
01:31:28,775 --> 01:31:31,108
Hello. Could I have a word with you?
What's your name?

1349
01:31:31,236 --> 01:31:33,444
- Joe Wallace.
- And you both work at Martindale's?

1350
01:31:33,571 --> 01:31:35,779
- Yeah, sort of.
- What happened to him?

1351
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,944
He beat someone up last night.

1352
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,408
- Who?
- Tom Curtis.

1353
01:31:39,536 --> 01:31:41,323
- Curtis?
- The bloke who was sent to Coventry?

1354
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,618
- And our answer must be...
- Mind your backs, please.

1355
01:31:44,749 --> 01:31:48,584
...that no machinery
to deal with victimisation...

1356
01:31:54,384 --> 01:31:56,421
Get him off there!

1357
01:31:56,553 --> 01:31:57,714
Let me have that mic!

1358
01:31:57,846 --> 01:32:00,463
- Nobody wants to listen!
- They'd better listen, and you had too!

1359
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,183
All right! Quiet for a moment!

1360
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:07,223
Quiet! Here's someone you all know.

1361
01:32:08,773 --> 01:32:10,309
Will you shut up and listen!

1362
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,519
They're not gonna listen to me.
You tell them!

1363
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:15,895
You tell them what you told me!

1364
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:20,699
I've got some news about Tom Curtis.

1365
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:25,196
I said, I've got some news
about Tom Curtis,

1366
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:26,538
and you're gonna hear it!

1367
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,745
He had an accident last night.

1368
01:32:32,881 --> 01:32:36,374
At least that's what some people
would like everyone to think.

1369
01:32:38,136 --> 01:32:40,173
Only... only I know different.

1370
01:32:41,306 --> 01:32:43,298
I... I've just come from the hospital.

1371
01:32:44,392 --> 01:32:47,681
Well, he's lying up there now
in the hospital

1372
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:49,303
where he's lost an eye.

1373
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,513
And...

1374
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:55,693
And I can tell you how he lost it.

1375
01:32:55,820 --> 01:32:57,652
Somebody kicked him in the face.

1376
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:01,489
That's how he lost it.

1377
01:33:02,911 --> 01:33:04,994
So...

1378
01:33:05,121 --> 01:33:10,537
I don't know...
whatever we think he did to us,

1379
01:33:10,668 --> 01:33:12,534
I reckon he's paid for it.

1380
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:19,042
And the reason he's paid for it is...

1381
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:21,169
because we let it happen.

1382
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:26,599
We sort of just stood by
and let it happen.

1383
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:32,354
Well, I let it happen
the same as the rest of you.

1384
01:33:33,900 --> 01:33:36,358
All I know is...

1385
01:33:37,403 --> 01:33:40,896
I feel I've done something dirty.
