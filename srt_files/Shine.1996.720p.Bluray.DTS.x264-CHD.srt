1
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:20,417
I did. I did.
I--I thought I was a cat.

2
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:23,812
Well, kind of, kind of.
I identified with cats.

3
00:00:23,813 --> 00:00:26,481
Well, I kind of did.
I wonder why that was?

4
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,287
They're never sure when you try
to stroke them, is that right?

5
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,987
So maybe I was a sad cat. Was I a sad cat?
Because I wonder--Yeah, yeah, yeah, I wonder about cats.

6
00:00:33,953 --> 00:00:36,825
Truly, I did. I did. I did.
'Cause I was a fuddy-duddy. Fuddy-duddy.

7
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:39,626
I kissed them all. Kissed them.
I will always kiss cats.

8
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:44,339
If a cat would let me kiss it, I'd kiss it.
You know, if I see a cat on the fence, I'll kiss it. Always.

9
00:00:44,346 --> 00:00:45,715
Always.
I would, didn't I?

10
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:07,153
Life's a perpetual risk,
isn't it?

11
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,655
That's right.
I think it is.

12
00:01:08,822 --> 00:01:10,448
Because, the point is,
I was different in those days.

13
00:01:10,615 --> 00:01:11,491
I was. I was.

14
00:01:11,658 --> 00:01:13,118
And I've--I've got to be
different again.

15
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:15,161
So, can the leopard
change its spots?

16
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:16,788
I mean, who knows?

17
00:01:21,835 --> 00:01:23,670
It's a blood sport.
I think it's a blood sport.

18
00:01:23,837 --> 00:01:25,672
It's true.
It seems to be true.

19
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:27,173
Or is it a blank?

20
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,675
Bit of a Scrabble.

21
00:01:28,842 --> 00:01:30,427
You've got to put
all the pieces together,

22
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:31,553
see if you can make a word.

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,139
That's funny.
That's funny. That's funny.

24
00:01:34,306 --> 00:01:36,474
It's a mystery.
It's a mystery.

25
00:02:15,347 --> 00:02:16,681
Bye!

26
00:02:16,848 --> 00:02:18,141
Take care.

27
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,019
Bye-bye.

28
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,282
We're closed!

29
00:02:44,376 --> 00:02:46,044
What's the problem, mate?

30
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:47,592
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, mate.
I'm the problem.

31
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:51,424
I think I'm the problem. Such a problem!
And wet! But it's not an ideal world.

32
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:53,877
Is it an ideal world?
We just have to make the most of it.

33
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:57,400
This is the way we find it, isn't it? Yeah, yeah.
It's more ideal than it was, because, I mean,

34
00:02:57,401 --> 00:03:00,432
You know, I mean, we're privileged.
We're privileged, aren't we? Because not long ago,

35
00:03:00,433 --> 00:03:03,235
people would be burnt to a steak,
wouldn't they, Moby? Moby, yeah!

36
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:05,918
No, no. It's Tony.
Tony, Tony, Tony.

37
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:09,047
Who am I, Tony? Who knows, Tony?
I don't know. So, ah!

38
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:11,470
I'm David. I'm David, Tony.
How does it sound?

39
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:15,420
Hi, David. How can Sylvia help?
Sylvia. Is it Sylvia? Sylvia! Hi, Sylvia!

40
00:03:15,421 --> 00:03:18,386
Pleased to meet you, Sylvia! Oh!
Schubert. Schubert, wasn't it?

41
00:03:18,387 --> 00:03:21,195
He said, "Who is Sylvia? What is she?"
What--what can we do for you, David?

42
00:03:21,196 --> 00:03:24,763
Do for me? Do for me? What? Oh, l--oh, l--
I got to stop talking. It's a problem, isn't it?

43
00:03:24,764 --> 00:03:27,088
No, no, no. It's all right.
Just tell Sylvia why you're here.

44
00:03:27,089 --> 00:03:29,806
Oh, well, uh, it's a mystery--
Are you lost? Am I lost?

45
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:32,547
Perhaps that's it. Perhaps I'm lost.
How does that sound? How does that sound?

46
00:03:33,316 --> 00:03:38,451
Is that your piano, Sylvia? Beautiful Sylvia.
lsn't Sylvia beautiful, Toby?

47
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,474
Not Toby. Tony. Tony. Tony.
You're beautiful, too, Tony.

48
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:45,010
Perhaps I could play it. Could I play it?
Could I play it? You say. You say.

49
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:46,418
Like hell, baby. Go on.
Shut up, Sam.

50
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:49,649
Hell, baby. Whoa, whoa! The devil.
Diablerie. Whoa, Sam...

51
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,050
David...Get out of here! Go on!
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia...

52
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,987
You just tell us who you are and where you live.
Could l--could I play? Live--live--live, Sylvia.

53
00:03:55,988 --> 00:03:58,638
Live and let live. That's very important,
isn't it? Molto, molto.

54
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,870
But then again, it's a lifelong struggle,
isn't it, Sylvia?

55
00:04:00,871 --> 00:04:02,804
Tony, Tony, Tony.
Sylvia. To--to survive.

56
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:05,893
To live. To survive. To survive undamaged...
and not to destroy any living, breathing creature.

57
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,970
I mean, the point is, if you do something wrong,
you're going to be punished for the rest of your life.

58
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,088
So I think it's a lifelong struggle.
Is it a lifelong struggle? Yeah.

59
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:14,911
Whatever you do, I think it's a struggle, a struggle,
a struggle to keep your head above water and not get it chopped off.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,763
I'm not disappointing you, am I, Sylvia? Tony?
Tony, Sylvia, Sam, yes, Sam! Hello, Sam!

61
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:21,222
Get off!

62
00:04:23,642 --> 00:04:25,101
Helfgott. What a name!

63
00:04:26,185 --> 00:04:29,055
Sorry, Sylvia. I sound like a donkey.
Helfgott. "With the help of God."

64
00:04:29,056 --> 00:04:32,239
That's what it means. You see,
Daddy's daddy was religious. Very religious.

65
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,992
Ve-very strict. And a bit of a meanie.
But he got exterminated, didn't he?

66
00:04:34,993 --> 00:04:38,878
So God didn't help him. That's not very funny.
It's very sad really.

67
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,759
I'm callous, Daddy said.
Callous. And a bit of a meanie.

68
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,470
Sorry, Sylvia, I'm not damaging you.
I mustn't damage Sylvia.

69
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:46,348
The point is, the point is,
perhaps I haven't got a soul.

70
00:04:46,675 --> 00:04:49,442
What makes you say that?
Daddy said there's no such thing as a soul.

71
00:04:49,443 --> 00:04:52,087
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Ridiculous. You're right. I am ridiculous.

72
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:55,486
And callous, Daddy said. Callous.
Callous. Ridiculous and callous.

73
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,500
Because it was a tragedy. A tragedy.
A ri-ridiculous tragedy.

74
00:05:10,394 --> 00:05:13,397
I'm going to win.
I'm going to win.

75
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,857
I'm going to win!

76
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,278
I'm going to win!

77
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,662
David's going to play
the piano for us.

78
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:29,663
Aren't you, David?

79
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,706
Yes.

80
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,541
What are you going to play?

81
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:38,755
What are you going to play?

82
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:39,756
Excuse me.

83
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,301
Chopin.
The Polonaise.

84
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,248
This is crazy.

85
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,916
It's the piano...

86
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,167
the piano.

87
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,756
It's a disgrace.

88
00:07:02,965 --> 00:07:04,341
This kid's good.

89
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,260
He's great.

90
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,515
He is my son.

91
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,059
My son.

92
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,368
Here they come.

93
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:34,246
Did he win or lose?

94
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,248
Margaret!

95
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:37,916
He lost.

96
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:41,044
Now we'll cop it.

97
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,441
It's your turn.

98
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,944
It's your turn, Daddy.

99
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,781
Let me see.

100
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,284
Let me see.

101
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:13,827
Let, uh, let me see.

102
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:18,290
You're losing.

103
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,167
You're losing.
You're losing.

104
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,504
David, always win.

105
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,172
Always...

106
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:27,174
win.

107
00:08:27,341 --> 00:08:28,675
You know, when l--

108
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,677
when I was a boy your age,

109
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,889
I bought a violin,
a beautiful violin.

110
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,641
And I saved for this violin.

111
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,185
And you know
what happened to it?

112
00:08:38,352 --> 00:08:39,686
Yes...
he smashed it.

113
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:40,979
Yeah...

114
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,814
he smashed it.

115
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,570
David,
you're a very lucky boy.

116
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,532
My father never let me
have music.

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,200
I know.

118
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,702
A very lucky boy.

119
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,703
Say it.

120
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,456
I'm a very lucky boy.

121
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:02,000
Very...lucky.

122
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:05,629
Now shall I play for you?

123
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,173
No. Pick up those pieces.

124
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,023
Bet I could have won.

125
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,358
You'd have been
too scared.

126
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,118
Listen.
Have a listen.

127
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,759
Margaret!

128
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,679
I told you,
tell your friends not to come.

129
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:21,788
Hello.

130
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,585
Daddy, there's
somebody to see you!

131
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,922
Hello.

132
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:34,426
I hope I'm not
interrupting.

133
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:37,930
Uh, Ben Rosen.
I was one of the judges.

134
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,056
Yes?

135
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,934
You left before all the prizes
were announced.

136
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,435
You were very good
this afternoon, David.

137
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:44,436
Thank you.

138
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,438
He can play better.

139
00:10:46,647 --> 00:10:47,731
Well, maybe he was
a little too good.

140
00:10:47,898 --> 00:10:49,691
Some people don't like that.

141
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:54,363
We, uh, we gave him a special
prize for his courage.

142
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,494
Difficult piece
you chose, David.

143
00:11:00,661 --> 00:11:02,246
Daddy chose it.

144
00:11:02,412 --> 00:11:04,039
Well, even great pianists
think twice...

145
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:05,499
before tackling
the Polonaise.

146
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,084
A prize for losing.

147
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:08,919
I wouldn't call him
a loser.

148
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:16,593
They all...

149
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,095
they all play.

150
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:20,264
Well, I'm quite sure...

151
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,100
David could win
lots of competitions...

152
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,518
with the right tuition.

153
00:11:24,685 --> 00:11:25,519
My card.

154
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:26,520
I teach him.

155
00:11:26,687 --> 00:11:28,272
Yeah. You've obviously
done very well.

156
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,233
Yeah.
No one taught me.

157
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,236
No music teachers,
Mr. Rosen.

158
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,737
No, of course.
It's just, uh...

159
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,239
it's just a few bad habits...

160
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:39,741
can sometimes mean the
difference between winning...

161
00:11:39,908 --> 00:11:41,118
or losing.

162
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:43,745
Well, perhaps you'd, uh, you'd
like to think about it, hmm?

163
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:24,953
It's Rachmaninoff.

164
00:12:26,455 --> 00:12:29,291
It's beautiful.

165
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,292
Yeah.

166
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:31,627
You taught yourself?

167
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,128
From the record.

168
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:35,297
Ah, yeah.

169
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,799
It's...it's very difficult.

170
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,301
It's very difficult.

171
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:40,802
It's...

172
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:45,807
it's the hardest piece
in the world, you know?

173
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:48,060
Will you teach me?

174
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,067
You know...

175
00:12:55,234 --> 00:12:57,819
one day you will play it.

176
00:12:57,986 --> 00:13:00,489
You will make me
very proud...

177
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:03,325
very proud,
won't you, David?

178
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,743
Yes.

179
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:13,961
And, uh...

180
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,504
next time...

181
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:19,341
What are we going to do?

182
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,843
We're going to win?

183
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,011
We're going to win,
yes.

184
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,513
So...

185
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,139
good night.

186
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,017
Good night, Daddy.

187
00:14:28,327 --> 00:14:30,871
Come.
Come, come, come.

188
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,307
Don't touch.
Don't touch.

189
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,435
Yes?

190
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:57,397
Mr. Rosen, I have decided
I would like...

191
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,900
you teach David...

192
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:01,235
this.

193
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,405
Rachmaninoff?
Don't be ridiculous.

194
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,741
But he can play it
already.

195
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:08,992
He's just a boy.

196
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:10,494
How can he express
that sort of passion?

197
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:13,163
You are a passionate man,
Mr. Rosen.

198
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,624
You will teach him, no?

199
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,084
No.

200
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:19,670
I will teach him
what I think is best.

201
00:15:19,837 --> 00:15:21,088
Rachmaninoff is best.

202
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:25,425
But...

203
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,011
You're his teacher.
I'll let you decide.

204
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:29,763
Thank you.

205
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,016
We'll start with Mozart.

206
00:15:33,183 --> 00:15:34,017
Mr. Rosen.

207
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:36,687
I can't afford to pay.

208
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,133
Come on, David.
Sylvia's getting wet.

209
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,135
Oh, sorry, Sylvia. Sorry.
Bye-bye, Tony. Bye.

210
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:09,136
See you later.

211
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:10,137
It's raining
cats and dogs!

212
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,471
Dogs and pussycats!

213
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:14,308
Look out!

214
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,648
You'll be all right,
then, David?

215
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,483
I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine, thank you.

216
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,651
This is it.
Home sweet home.

217
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:25,652
Oh, you can play.

218
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,654
Oh, kind of, kind of,
kind of play.

219
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,780
Kind, sweet Sylvia.

220
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,657
Chopin, Sylvia. Chopinzee!
The pole. Polski.

221
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,618
Like Daddy
a-and his family...

222
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,119
before they were
concentrated.

223
00:16:34,286 --> 00:16:35,287
How long have you
been here, David?

224
00:16:35,496 --> 00:16:36,705
Oh, golly, I don't know.
A few years, I think.

225
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:38,165
Eons, I suppose.
How does that sound?

226
00:16:38,373 --> 00:16:39,625
And Schubert. Schubert.

227
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,792
Nothing wrong with Schubert,
of course--except syphilis.

228
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,294
Was it syphilis?
I think it was.

229
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,378
And then he got typhoid
on top of that,

230
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,630
so that
was the end of him.

231
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,131
We lost him. That was
a bit careless of us, wasn't it?

232
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,132
We lost him...

233
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:48,634
So, you're back?

234
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,636
Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim,
I've been a naughty boy.

235
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,137
Was I a naughty boy?

236
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:53,639
I was about to send out
a search party.

237
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,307
Oh, a party, a party.
I won't be invited again...

238
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,142
He came into my restaurant
and seemed a bit lost.

239
00:16:57,309 --> 00:16:58,644
Oh, he's very good at that.

240
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:00,646
Thanks for
bringing him home.

241
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:01,647
We'll have a party...

242
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,648
Bye, David.

243
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:03,649
It's time for a wine.
A very fine time.

244
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,235
A Mardi Gras.
A nice long cigar.

245
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:18,163
The winner and our youngest
ever state champion...

246
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:19,832
David Helfgott!

247
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:25,170
Mr. Rosen...

248
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,672
We won! We won!

249
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,173
Thanks to Mozart,
hmm?

250
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,341
And now he can play
Rachmaninoff.

251
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:32,010
And now to present David
with the prize money,

252
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,680
our very special guest from
America, ladies and gentlemen,

253
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,890
currently on tour
in Australia...

254
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,725
Mr. lsaac Stern.

255
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,865
You have a very special
talent, David.

256
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,408
Oh, th-thank you,
thank you, Mr. Stern.

257
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:57,202
Uh, so do you.

258
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:59,163
How much are you prepared
to give to your music, David?

259
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,206
H-how much?

260
00:18:01,373 --> 00:18:03,500
David! Everything!
Everything!

261
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,002
Everything.

262
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:08,505
But, uh,
I do like tennis

263
00:18:08,672 --> 00:18:10,757
and, uh, chemistry, too.

264
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,343
And do you play tennis
as well as you play Mozart?

265
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,013
Uh, l--I just play up against
the wall at home.

266
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,015
I, uh, I bounce the ball
against the wall mainly.

267
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:20,684
How would you like to go to a
special school in the States...

268
00:18:20,851 --> 00:18:23,187
where music
bounces off the walls?

269
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,813
A-America?

270
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,524
You know, uh, land of the free,
home of the brave--

271
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,525
Mickey Mouse?

272
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,277
Ladies and gentlemen,

273
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:32,613
what an honor for our young
state champion:

274
00:18:32,821 --> 00:18:35,282
an invitation to study
in America.

275
00:18:47,044 --> 00:18:48,378
And now,

276
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,839
all the way from America...

277
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:53,342
David Helfgott!

278
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,510
Thank you.
Thank you.

279
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,512
Not from America.

280
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,347
But he's going
to America,

281
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,932
and when he comes back,

282
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,517
he'll be coming from there,
won't you, David?

283
00:19:01,683 --> 00:19:02,601
Oh, I suppose so.

284
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,727
Margaret.

285
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,407
No. I have no money
to send David to America.

286
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,409
Well, uh...

287
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,954
We'll raise it.

288
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,121
What?

289
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:29,753
Bar mitzvah.

290
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,423
David hasn't yet
had his bar mitzvah.

291
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:43,475
Religion is nonsense.

292
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:46,436
It's also a gold mine
if you know where to dig.

293
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,489
And then one day,
I-I'll play with an orchestra.

294
00:19:57,698 --> 00:19:59,283
Wow! Can I come
when you do?

295
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:01,493
You can ride
in my Cadillac.

296
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:03,495
Where are you going
to live in America?

297
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:06,915
With a nice Jewish family,
they said.

298
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,543
This is not a nice family?

299
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,421
Yes, Daddy.
It's...very nice.

300
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:15,966
You're very lucky
to have a family, David.

301
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,563
I've got to go.

302
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,277
It's one of the finest
music schools in the world.

303
00:20:35,444 --> 00:20:37,613
It is for his father
to decide.

304
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,782
He would be well looked after,
I assure you.

305
00:20:40,949 --> 00:20:41,950
Rachel, please.

306
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:45,787
David could be one of
the truly great pianists.

307
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:48,373
He is just a boy,
Mr. Rosen.

308
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,375
He still wets his bed.

309
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:35,128
You see how fit I am?
How strong?

310
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,547
Show me where the lion
scratched you...

311
00:21:36,755 --> 00:21:38,382
when you worked
in the circus, Daddy.

312
00:21:41,927 --> 00:21:44,471
Up, up, up, up, up.

313
00:21:44,638 --> 00:21:45,973
Yeah.
That's what happens...

314
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:48,934
when you get too close
to the bars, eh?

315
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,519
David?
David, come.

316
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,020
Come. Hit me.

317
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:53,021
OK.

318
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:55,023
Hit me.

319
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,525
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
As hard as you can.

320
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:58,026
Me! I want
to hit you, Daddy!

321
00:21:58,193 --> 00:21:59,611
You, too.
As hard as you can.

322
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,739
You see?
A man of steel!

323
00:22:02,948 --> 00:22:04,741
No one can hurt me.

324
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,452
Because in this world,
only the fit survive.

325
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,039
The weak get crushed
like insects.

326
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,207
Like grasshoppers,
Daddy.

327
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:15,043
Believe me, if you want
to survive in America,

328
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,546
you have to be fit...

329
00:22:17,713 --> 00:22:19,131
and strong.

330
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,549
Like you, Daddy.

331
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:23,051
Yeah.

332
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:25,429
Like me. Yes.

333
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,932
That's good.

334
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,341
See you next week,
David.

335
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:03,592
Don't forget to study.

336
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:05,260
Thank you, Rabbi.

337
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:27,658
Mr. Helfgott,
it is exciting, isn't it?

338
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:30,994
David, the lord mayor
is dying to meet you.

339
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:36,124
Peter.

340
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:37,125
Mr. Rosen.

341
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:38,627
Ladies and gentlemen,

342
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:41,630
can I have
your attention please?

343
00:23:41,797 --> 00:23:45,634
I would like to thank
our wonderful lord mayor...

344
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:50,305
for establishing this fund
to send David to America.

345
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,768
And now to play for us,
our very own David Helfgott.

346
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,172
These people are a disgrace.

347
00:24:23,338 --> 00:24:25,674
They think they are
so important.

348
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:28,260
What do they know with
their furs and their diamonds?

349
00:24:28,427 --> 00:24:30,596
It makes me sick...
to the stomach.

350
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:33,932
And Rosen.
What kind of man is he?

351
00:24:34,099 --> 00:24:35,434
He is not married.

352
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:36,768
He has no children.

353
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,939
Don't talk to me
about Rosen.

354
00:24:41,106 --> 00:24:42,149
He only wants for David...

355
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:44,193
the same as
you have always wanted.

356
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,444
Don't ever compare me
to him.

357
00:24:45,611 --> 00:24:47,946
What has he suffered?
Not a day in his life.

358
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:49,448
What does he know?

359
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:53,327
Does he know
about families?

360
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,956
About...how
your sisters died?

361
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:00,709
And my mother and father?

362
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,535
Thank you!
Thank you, David!

363
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,537
Thank you, Comrade Helfgott.

364
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:21,874
Your son
is a credit to you.

365
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:26,420
On behalf of
the Soviet Friendship Society,

366
00:26:26,587 --> 00:26:28,088
we applaud you.

367
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:35,512
How do you do?

368
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:36,930
Meet
Katharine Prichard.

369
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,026
You play beautifully.

370
00:26:49,193 --> 00:26:50,444
Thank you.

371
00:26:50,652 --> 00:26:52,446
My name's Sonia.

372
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:54,448
I-I'm David.

373
00:26:54,615 --> 00:26:56,950
I know who you are.

374
00:26:57,117 --> 00:27:00,787
You've got the most
wonderful hands.

375
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:02,164
So do you.

376
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,335
So, um, are you--

377
00:27:06,502 --> 00:27:07,961
You're going to America?

378
00:27:08,128 --> 00:27:09,463
That's right. Yeah.

379
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,966
Maybe one day you'll--
you'll go to Russia, too.

380
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,801
Why not?

381
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:21,934
I'm here.

382
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,478
There's someone important
who wants to meet you.

383
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,857
I'd better go.

384
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,496
I've never met anyone...

385
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,499
who plays the piano
as beautifully as you, David.

386
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:48,001
I've never met a writer before,
Mrs. Prichard.

387
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,003
You must be very proud
of him.

388
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:52,506
As proud
as a father can be.

389
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:55,008
I have a long-suffering
old piano at home.

390
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,260
Suffering piano.

391
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,386
From neglect.

392
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,888
Perhaps you'll come
and play it for me one day.

393
00:28:00,055 --> 00:28:02,474
Yes. Anything to help.

394
00:28:02,641 --> 00:28:04,268
I'd like that very much.

395
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:05,602
Me, too.

396
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:08,897
Your attention, comrades.

397
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:10,899
I wish to propose a toast.

398
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,401
That's my cue.
Excuse me.

399
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:15,404
To our founder and very
special guest this evening,

400
00:28:15,571 --> 00:28:16,905
Katharine Susannah Prichard.

401
00:28:17,072 --> 00:28:19,408
You will learn much
from this old woman.

402
00:28:19,575 --> 00:28:21,577
She has been
to Soviet Union.

403
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,689
From America!

404
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:53,817
"We have been informed
of your exceptional talent

405
00:28:53,984 --> 00:28:55,861
"and can only say
how privileged we feel

406
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,863
"to have you come
and stay with us.

407
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,866
"We're sure you'll feel
very much at home here,

408
00:29:01,033 --> 00:29:02,868
"and you'll be
pleased to know

409
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,287
"we're having the Bosendorfer
tuned especially.

410
00:29:05,454 --> 00:29:07,372
"We eagerly await
your innement arrival--"

411
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,874
lmminent.

412
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:10,918
I wonder if they've got
a Cadillac.

413
00:29:11,084 --> 00:29:13,212
"...imminent arrival

414
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,381
"and look forward to hearing you
play for us.

415
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:18,800
"Kindest wishes,
Simon and Basha Mickleburg."

416
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:19,927
Read it again!
Read it again!

417
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,514
Shush!
You'll wake the baby.

418
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:27,017
"You'll enjoy the company
of our parakeet

419
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:29,478
"and our poodle
called Margaret."

420
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,938
Pig! lt is not!

421
00:29:31,104 --> 00:29:31,939
Pig!

422
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:32,940
It is too.

423
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:35,108
Enough! Enough!

424
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:36,610
Turn it off!

425
00:29:36,777 --> 00:29:38,820
Give me the letter.

426
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:41,198
David is not going
anywhere.

427
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,828
Daddy.

428
00:29:45,994 --> 00:29:48,330
What are you looking at,
you fools?

429
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,165
He is not going to America.

430
00:29:50,332 --> 00:29:53,836
I won't let anyone
destroy this family!

431
00:29:54,002 --> 00:29:56,296
Please, Daddy, don't.

432
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,176
I know, David,
what is best,

433
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,095
because I'm your father.

434
00:30:03,262 --> 00:30:05,347
I'm your father,

435
00:30:05,514 --> 00:30:08,559
and this is your family!

436
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:12,187
David!

437
00:30:12,354 --> 00:30:13,522
David, come back!

438
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:15,232
Come back!

439
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,947
I know what's best.

440
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:24,533
Believe me.

441
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,743
Close the door!

442
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:36,670
Mr. Rosen!

443
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:42,176
Mr. Rosen, please,
it's David!

444
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:45,888
Mr. Rosen!

445
00:31:30,098 --> 00:31:31,975
Time to get out, David.

446
00:31:32,184 --> 00:31:34,478
It's my turn
for the bath.

447
00:31:34,686 --> 00:31:35,979
Are you feeling
better now?

448
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,523
Have you stopped
shivering?

449
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,900
You know, a bath
is always the best, David.

450
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,068
Always the...

451
00:31:44,071 --> 00:31:45,447
Disgusting animal.

452
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,449
To shit in the bath.

453
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:50,869
To do this to me.

454
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,622
You disgusting animal!

455
00:33:10,157 --> 00:33:12,826
I know you can hear me.

456
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:16,497
Don't do this to David.

457
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,917
You mustn't stop him going.

458
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,021
Whatever you do,

459
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,483
don't you dare inflict bloody
Rachmaninoff on him.

460
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,068
He's not ready!

461
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:15,514
David...my boy.

462
00:34:15,681 --> 00:34:18,016
It's a terrible thing...

463
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:20,102
to hate your father.

464
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,314
You know,
life is cruel, but...

465
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:28,026
but music...

466
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:31,029
music, it will always...

467
00:34:31,196 --> 00:34:32,531
always be your friend.

468
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:34,032
Everything else...

469
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,534
will let you down.

470
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:38,495
ln the end, everything,
believe me, everything.

471
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:44,376
Don't hate me.

472
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:48,755
Life is cruel.

473
00:34:50,215 --> 00:34:52,551
But you have...

474
00:34:52,718 --> 00:34:54,553
you have to...

475
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,638
you have to survive.

476
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:01,852
You have to survive.

477
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,479
Say it.

478
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:07,566
You have to survive,
Daddy.

479
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:09,651
You have to survive.

480
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:23,582
No one...

481
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,501
will love you like me.

482
00:35:28,337 --> 00:35:30,881
You can't trust anyone.

483
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,760
But I will always...

484
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:36,678
be there.

485
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:46,104
I will always
be with you.

486
00:35:46,271 --> 00:35:47,940
Forever and ever.

487
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,527
Forever and ever, Daddy.

488
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:56,383
Each time you play for me,

489
00:36:56,592 --> 00:37:00,179
it expresses
so completely the...

490
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,306
inexpressible.

491
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,932
Is  that good?

492
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:05,392
It's divine.

493
00:37:05,601 --> 00:37:07,728
lnexpressibly divine.

494
00:37:07,895 --> 00:37:09,730
Quite.

495
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:15,736
Tell me a story,
Katharine.

496
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,237
What's the story today?

497
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:19,239
A new story.

498
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:21,241
Drops of water?

499
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,243
Ah...raindrops.

500
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:25,829
Yes, raindrops.

501
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,762
Perfect.

502
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:46,225
I shall treasure this
till the day I die.

503
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,780
"To you, all these
wild weeds...

504
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:02,282
"and wind flowers
of my life...

505
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:03,784
"l bring, my Lord,

506
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:06,286
"and lay them
at your feet.

507
00:38:06,453 --> 00:38:08,789
"They're not
frankincense or myrrh,

508
00:38:08,956 --> 00:38:12,292
"but you are Krishna,
Christ, and Dionysus...

509
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:16,922
"in your beauty,
tenderness, and strength."

510
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:55,961
That was our final contestant
David Helfgott...

511
00:38:56,128 --> 00:38:58,922
with a very stirring
Rachmaninoff.

512
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,009
Well, what a close
contest we have,

513
00:39:02,176 --> 00:39:03,510
with the national
championship...

514
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:06,013
almost certain to go
to one of the two pianists.

515
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:07,514
Bravo, David.

516
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,017
I dare say it's going to be
difficult for the judges...

517
00:39:10,184 --> 00:39:11,518
to separate them,

518
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,770
either one a worthy winner.

519
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:16,690
The judges
are now conferring.

520
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:27,701
It's a tough game,
isn't it, Roger?

521
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:29,453
It's a blood sport.

522
00:40:03,028 --> 00:40:04,154
Ladies and gentlemen...

523
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:08,033
I'm pleased to announce
the winner...

524
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,244
of this year's instrumental
and vocal competition.

525
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,373
Our new
national champion is...

526
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:18,043
Roger Woodward.

527
00:41:17,227 --> 00:41:19,521
What was he like,
Katharine?

528
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,065
Your father.

529
00:41:24,234 --> 00:41:27,404
He was forever busy
in his study.

530
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,866
"Go away, Kattie,
I'm writing," he'd always say.

531
00:41:31,033 --> 00:41:34,369
One day--
oh, I was very young--

532
00:41:34,536 --> 00:41:36,663
I got so annoyed...

533
00:41:36,830 --> 00:41:40,167
that I upset the ink pots
all over his desk...

534
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,877
and scrawled on his work.

535
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,545
Pages of it.

536
00:41:44,796 --> 00:41:46,089
When he saw it,

537
00:41:46,256 --> 00:41:49,092
he just stood there
seething with anger.

538
00:41:49,259 --> 00:41:50,594
I could feel it.

539
00:41:50,802 --> 00:41:53,430
"What are you doing?"
he shouted.

540
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:59,186
Well, there was this
terrible silence...

541
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:01,688
and I just stared
at him and said,

542
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,858
"Go away, Daddy.
I'm writing."

543
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,696
He ran at me
and he picked me up...

544
00:42:09,863 --> 00:42:12,157
and he cuddled me
breathless.

545
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:18,288
My first literary effort,
he always called it.

546
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,422
David, what is it?

547
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:41,395
Royal College of Music.

548
00:42:42,896 --> 00:42:44,898
A scholarship.

549
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:49,027
Oh, David, that's marvelous.

550
00:42:50,737 --> 00:42:53,740
Daddy won't cuddle me,
Katharine. Oh, no.

551
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,243
He can't stop you,
David.

552
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:58,745
He's such an angry lion,
Katharine.

553
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:01,748
Oh, nonsense.
He's a pussycat.

554
00:43:05,419 --> 00:43:07,921
I'll miss you.

555
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:20,767
These were for my son,
but you better have them.

556
00:43:20,934 --> 00:43:24,438
It gets very, very cold
in London.

557
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:09,024
Where have you been?

558
00:44:09,191 --> 00:44:11,151
I missed the train.

559
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,195
That Prichard woman.

560
00:44:14,404 --> 00:44:16,198
What is this?

561
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:17,699
The gloves.

562
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,457
Look at me.

563
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,377
Look at me!

564
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:48,730
And you think you can just do
as you please?

565
00:44:50,941 --> 00:44:53,735
I--I want to go,
and you can't stop me.

566
00:44:53,944 --> 00:44:54,987
But...

567
00:44:55,154 --> 00:44:57,406
I'm your father...

568
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,908
who has done
everything for you.

569
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,285
Everything!

570
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:03,787
You cruel, callous boy!

571
00:45:03,954 --> 00:45:05,289
Mum! Margaret!

572
00:45:05,455 --> 00:45:07,166
Stupid! Stupid--

573
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,418
Leave him. Leave him!
Leave him alone.

574
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:16,258
Go, go! Go!

575
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:18,260
You want to go, go!

576
00:45:18,468 --> 00:45:20,179
I'll call the police!

577
00:45:20,345 --> 00:45:21,180
Go! Go!

578
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,265
Stop it!

579
00:45:23,473 --> 00:45:24,516
Yeah, all right.

580
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:25,726
Leave him.

581
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:27,728
He's all right.

582
00:45:27,895 --> 00:45:30,856
Are you all right,
David?

583
00:45:31,899 --> 00:45:33,734
Are you all right?
Yeah?

584
00:45:33,901 --> 00:45:35,777
Come on, David.

585
00:45:37,154 --> 00:45:39,156
He's all right.

586
00:45:39,323 --> 00:45:42,868
I'm old enough
to make up my own mind.

587
00:45:43,035 --> 00:45:45,579
He thinks he's going
to London.

588
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:48,957
I've been accepted into
the Royal College of Music.

589
00:45:49,124 --> 00:45:51,627
What do you think is going
to happen to you in London?

590
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:56,298
David...

591
00:45:56,507 --> 00:45:58,008
if you go...

592
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:00,969
you will never come back
into this house again.

593
00:46:01,136 --> 00:46:04,306
You will never be
anybody's son.

594
00:46:04,473 --> 00:46:07,184
The girls  will lose
a brother.

595
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:09,186
Is that what you want?

596
00:46:09,353 --> 00:46:11,313
You want...

597
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:14,691
you want to destroy
your family?

598
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,027
I'm--I'm sorry.

599
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:23,200
David, if you love me,
you will stop this nonsense.

600
00:46:23,367 --> 00:46:26,286
You will not
step out that door.

601
00:46:26,453 --> 00:46:28,288
David.

602
00:46:28,455 --> 00:46:30,791
If you go,

603
00:46:30,958 --> 00:46:33,293
you will be punished...

604
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,796
for the rest
of your life.

605
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:37,798
My David.

606
00:46:37,965 --> 00:46:39,591
Don't go.

607
00:46:49,852 --> 00:46:51,478
David!

608
00:46:52,688 --> 00:46:55,649
Don't make me do it!

609
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:03,509
He has the most
fantastic hands.

610
00:48:03,675 --> 00:48:06,094
Not connected to anything
above his shoulders.

611
00:48:06,261 --> 00:48:09,890
Oh, he's a bit
fragile, certainly.

612
00:48:10,057 --> 00:48:11,642
Chopinzee.

613
00:48:11,808 --> 00:48:13,143
I've seen enough
to suggest...

614
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,563
that he can make the finals
in the concerto trials.

615
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,899
What have you seen,
Cecil?

616
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,442
Moments of genius.

617
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:22,194
Genius?

618
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:24,571
Really.

619
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:32,037
Come on, David.

620
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:34,164
Boldness of attack.

621
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:36,500
Diablerie.

622
00:48:37,626 --> 00:48:38,919
The devil, David.

623
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,420
Mustn't break the piano.

624
00:48:40,587 --> 00:48:42,422
Liszt broke
plenty of strings.

625
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:44,091
Right. Right.

626
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:45,968
Come on.

627
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,929
Fill in for this
useless arm of mine.

628
00:48:49,096 --> 00:48:50,472
The notes first.

629
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:52,474
The interpretation
comes on top of them.

630
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:53,684
On top, yes. Yes.

631
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:54,893
You agree, do you?

632
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:57,396
Oh, yes. I always agree,
Professor.

633
00:48:57,604 --> 00:48:58,897
Is that wise?

634
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,400
I--I don't know.
Is it?

635
00:49:01,608 --> 00:49:04,695
Don't forget.
It's on the page.

636
00:49:04,862 --> 00:49:07,990
Yes. Well, the...the notes
are on the page,

637
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,492
but, uh, not the feeling,
the emotion.

638
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:11,577
That's what I feel.

639
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:13,579
You mustn't sacrifice
everything to emotion.

640
00:49:13,745 --> 00:49:15,747
It's all a question
of balance.

641
00:49:15,956 --> 00:49:18,750
Ah, yes. ls that the question,
Professor?

642
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,169
Precisely.

643
00:49:20,335 --> 00:49:23,422
Ah. I thought so.
That's what I thought.

644
00:49:38,353 --> 00:49:39,605
Mr. Helfgott!

645
00:49:39,771 --> 00:49:40,939
Your allowance check!

646
00:49:41,148 --> 00:49:42,316
Thank you, Mr. Right.

647
00:49:42,483 --> 00:49:43,817
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

648
00:49:43,984 --> 00:49:46,320
I'll just stand still
if you like.

649
00:49:46,487 --> 00:49:47,821
Be careful, David.

650
00:49:47,988 --> 00:49:49,323
Oh, by all means,
Sarah.

651
00:49:49,490 --> 00:49:50,365
You look lovely
today, Sarah.

652
00:49:50,532 --> 00:49:51,783
Thank you, David.

653
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,285
You, too, Muriel.

654
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,829
Ease up, Helfgott. Sarah!

655
00:49:55,996 --> 00:49:58,248
David! You missed the bank.

656
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,042
Pity. You'll have to wait
until tomorrow.

657
00:50:00,209 --> 00:50:01,543
Can't bank on the bank.

658
00:50:01,710 --> 00:50:03,003
We know someone
who can cash it.

659
00:50:03,170 --> 00:50:04,087
Do we, Robert?

660
00:50:04,254 --> 00:50:05,297
What are friends for?

661
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:02,104
Got to concentrate.

662
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,105
Got to concentrate,
Katharine.

663
00:51:03,272 --> 00:51:05,107
Got to practice,
practice, practice,

664
00:51:05,274 --> 00:51:07,609
because there's 3 important
things Professor Parkes says,

665
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,111
and that's work, work, work.

666
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:11,572
And--and, uh, so that's
what I have to do...

667
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:14,575
if I'm, uh, going to make the
finals to the Concerto Medal,

668
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,118
because the winner,

669
00:51:16,285 --> 00:51:17,786
which gets to play
at the Royal Albert Hall,

670
00:51:17,995 --> 00:51:19,288
which is right outside
the window.

671
00:51:19,454 --> 00:51:22,082
I--I bought a piano,
Katharine.

672
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:23,584
A beautiful piano.

673
00:51:23,750 --> 00:51:25,752
It's a suffering piano,
like yours.

674
00:51:27,546 --> 00:51:29,339
I--I wrote to Daddy,

675
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:31,341
so, uh, that's a positive.

676
00:51:31,550 --> 00:51:32,843
It's a positive, isn't it?

677
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,095
Because, well, it seems to be,
because he didn't write back,

678
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,306
but, um, uh...

679
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,960
Now, how on Earth...

680
00:51:54,168 --> 00:51:55,753
did we manage to get into
the finals, David?

681
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,255
You're a conductor's
nightmare.

682
00:51:57,422 --> 00:51:58,756
It's true, it's true.

683
00:51:58,923 --> 00:52:00,258
And what are we
going to do?

684
00:52:00,425 --> 00:52:02,552
We're going to win, actually,
Robert. We're going to win.

685
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:08,308
Rachmaninoff?
Are you sure?

686
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:09,892
Uh, kind of.

687
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:13,021
I'm never really sure
about anything, Mr. Parkes.

688
00:52:13,187 --> 00:52:15,398
The Rach 3.

689
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:16,816
It's monumental!

690
00:52:16,983 --> 00:52:18,318
It's a mountain.

691
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:20,361
It's the hardest piece
you could Everest play.

692
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:25,366
Well, no one's ever been mad
enough to attempt the Rach 3.

693
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:28,536
Am l...
mad enough, Professor?

694
00:52:28,703 --> 00:52:30,455
Am I?

695
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,323
Think of it as two separate
melodies jousting for supremacy.

696
00:52:44,201 --> 00:52:46,245
The hands, giants--

697
00:52:46,453 --> 00:52:48,038
ten fingers each.

698
00:52:51,375 --> 00:52:53,210
Performing's a risk,
you know--

699
00:52:53,377 --> 00:52:54,461
no safety net.

700
00:52:54,628 --> 00:52:56,839
Make no mistake,
David.

701
00:52:57,006 --> 00:52:58,465
It's dangerous.

702
00:52:58,632 --> 00:52:59,842
People get hurt.

703
00:53:01,343 --> 00:53:03,762
You have to learn to be able
to play it blindfolded.

704
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,392
The page,
for God's sake!

705
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:09,977
The notes!

706
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:11,812
I'm sorry. I was, uh,
forgetting them, Professor.

707
00:53:11,979 --> 00:53:14,940
Would it be asking too much
to learn them first?

708
00:53:15,107 --> 00:53:16,191
And--and then
forget them?

709
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:17,609
Precisely.

710
00:53:17,776 --> 00:53:20,029
Just give me
the fingering.

711
00:54:01,737 --> 00:54:04,907
David.
Come on, my boy.

712
00:54:05,074 --> 00:54:07,368
We're going to rest
muscles and fingers today...

713
00:54:07,534 --> 00:54:09,536
and try to exercise
the imagination.

714
00:54:10,537 --> 00:54:13,123
First movement cadenza.

715
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:16,752
Let's pick it up
from, uh...

716
00:54:24,927 --> 00:54:27,596
Your hands must form
the unbreakable habit...

717
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:29,098
of playing the notes,

718
00:54:29,264 --> 00:54:31,600
so that you can forget
all about them...

719
00:54:31,767 --> 00:54:33,435
and let it come from here.

720
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:35,020
The heart...

721
00:54:35,187 --> 00:54:37,648
that's where
it comes from.

722
00:54:50,035 --> 00:54:53,455
Don't you just love
those big, fat chords?

723
00:54:53,622 --> 00:54:55,499
You have to tame
the piano, David,

724
00:54:55,666 --> 00:54:57,751
or it'll get away from you.

725
00:54:57,918 --> 00:54:58,752
It's a monster.

726
00:54:58,919 --> 00:55:01,714
Tame it,
or it'll swallow you whole.

727
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:08,846
Coming along nicely,
David.

728
00:55:56,685 --> 00:55:58,437
Morning, Mrs. Perkins.

729
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:18,392
I call this
my little mausoleum, David.

730
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,520
Ah, Liszt--

731
00:57:21,687 --> 00:57:23,856
warts and all.

732
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:27,026
They made this
after he was dead.

733
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,446
Poor Franz.
Dead as a post, eh?

734
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,698
You can still get these
on the Left Bank, you know.

735
00:57:32,906 --> 00:57:34,199
Quite cheap.

736
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:44,543
I've got Rachmaninoff
in here somewhere.

737
00:57:48,964 --> 00:57:51,800
Magnificent fingers.

738
00:57:51,967 --> 00:57:53,260
So virile.

739
00:57:56,805 --> 00:57:58,641
You know, l...

740
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:01,810
played the Rach 3
for him once.

741
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:02,978
Really?

742
00:58:04,229 --> 00:58:05,564
Yes.

743
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:09,276
He said he could hear
himself in my playing.

744
00:58:10,903 --> 00:58:12,571
He said it seemed...

745
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:15,824
as if I had
touched his soul.

746
00:58:15,991 --> 00:58:17,785
That wasn't so bad,
was it?

747
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:21,205
Not too bad at all,
Professor.

748
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:22,623
Now it's your turn, David.

749
00:58:23,999 --> 00:58:25,209
Remember...

750
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:29,964
once you've done it, nobody can
ever take it away from you.

751
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:32,174
And you must play...

752
00:58:32,341 --> 00:58:34,593
as if there was
no tomorrow.

753
00:58:55,531 --> 00:58:57,533
Come on, David,
don't let me down.

754
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:05,499
How many moments
of genius today, Cecil?

755
01:05:21,417 --> 01:05:23,252
Hello?

756
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,670
Who is this?

757
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:27,631
Hello?

758
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:30,175
Daddy?

759
01:05:33,929 --> 01:05:35,556
Daddy, I'm home.

760
01:05:36,765 --> 01:05:37,766
Daddy?

761
01:05:40,185 --> 01:05:41,145
Hello?

762
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:42,313
Daddy?

763
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,594
Someone here
to see you, David.

764
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:56,971
It's me, David.

765
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:58,138
Suzie.

766
01:07:01,433 --> 01:07:03,143
Suzie.

767
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:04,895
Suzie.
Do we know Suzie?

768
01:07:05,062 --> 01:07:06,355
Your sister, David.

769
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:07,856
Oh, sister Suzie,
sister Suzie.

770
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:11,026
Thank you, Sister.
Sister Nurse. Sister Suzie.

771
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:19,618
David, I won't be able
to come and visit so often.

772
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:21,578
Not--not so often,
sweet--sweet, soft Suzie.

773
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:22,830
Not so often.

774
01:07:22,997 --> 01:07:23,956
I'm going to live
in Melbourne.

775
01:07:24,164 --> 01:07:25,708
Oh, that's a trick.
Don't tell Daddy.

776
01:07:25,874 --> 01:07:28,460
The milk--the milk--mustn't cry
over spilt milk.

777
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,754
Oh, well, what can you do,
Margaret? What can you do?

778
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:32,464
Margaret's in lsrael,
remember?

779
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,967
I remember Margaret.
She called me dopey.

780
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:36,635
Or was it a pig?
It was the poodle.

781
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,138
It was the poodle.
It was the poodle.

782
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:40,431
It was all very
complicated, wasn't it?

783
01:07:40,597 --> 01:07:42,141
Complicato in lsrael.

784
01:07:43,183 --> 01:07:44,935
It was--it was
a battleground.

785
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,312
War zone.
It was a war zone.

786
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,563
It was such a bore,
it was such a bore.

787
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:50,441
It was always a war.
It was all--

788
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:53,611
it just destroys everything,
really, doesn't it?

789
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:22,116
David.

790
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,242
That's right, Nurse.
That's right.

791
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,743
I knew I'd find you here.

792
01:09:24,952 --> 01:09:26,120
Oh, I've been a naughty
boy again, haven't I?

793
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:27,788
I--I misbehaved,
haven't I, Nurse?

794
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,206
I think I have.
That's true, isn't it?

795
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,207
Come on, David.

796
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,583
I--I might get into trouble.
I might--

797
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:32,918
I might get punished
for the rest of my life,

798
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,712
because--because I'm flawed.
I'm--I'm fatally flawed.

799
01:09:34,878 --> 01:09:37,089
Oh, you silly sausage.

800
01:09:37,298 --> 01:09:39,049
Because it--it's
f-f-forbidden fruit.

801
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,719
The doctor said
it's forbidden fruit.

802
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:57,067
I--l--I'm not disappointing him
and all that.

803
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:59,236
Am--am l
disappointing him?

804
01:09:59,403 --> 01:10:01,322
Because, you see, the thing is,
he was--he was--

805
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:03,032
he--he didn't approve,
did he? He didn't approve.

806
01:10:03,198 --> 01:10:05,200
He was--he was
very disapproving.

807
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,183
Come on, Charlie.

808
01:10:29,350 --> 01:10:32,353
Let's put it over here,
shall we?

809
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:41,111
Oh, so you can
read music?

810
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:42,613
Oh, kind of. Kind of.

811
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,281
Perhaps I'm just
turning over a new leaf.

812
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:46,659
But that's all right,
isn't it?

813
01:10:46,825 --> 01:10:48,702
My name's Beryl Alcott.
What's yours?

814
01:10:48,869 --> 01:10:50,329
Alcott, Alcott. Oh,
that sounds a lot like my name.

815
01:10:50,537 --> 01:10:51,622
Helfgott--
that's my name, Beryl.

816
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:52,623
Helfgott?

817
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:53,791
That's right.
Ridiculous, isn't it?

818
01:10:53,999 --> 01:10:55,250
It means
"with the help of God."

819
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,335
It's ridiculous.

820
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,712
What's your first name,
Mr. Helfgott?

821
01:10:58,879 --> 01:11:00,381
Ridiculous. Oh, yes,
first things first, Beryl.

822
01:11:00,547 --> 01:11:02,508
Uh, David. I'm David.
I'm David. How's that sound?

823
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,095
You're David Helfgott?

824
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:08,138
That's right, Beryl.
That's right.

825
01:11:08,305 --> 01:11:10,391
But I used to watch you win
all those competitions.

826
01:11:10,557 --> 01:11:11,767
Oh, win some, lose some.

827
01:11:11,934 --> 01:11:13,268
You can't lose them all.
It's not your fault.

828
01:11:13,435 --> 01:11:16,188
I was quite a fan.

829
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,151
Do you still play?

830
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,695
Oh, I mustn't.
The doctor said I mustn't.

831
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,029
It'll all end in tears
if I misbehave.

832
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,322
You mustn't?

833
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:26,699
I mustn't.
That's right.

834
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,158
That's right. ls that right?
I think it's right.

835
01:11:28,325 --> 01:11:30,077
Because it might damage me. The
doctor said it might damage me,

836
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:32,246
because it did--long time--
long time--once before.

837
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,497
Long, long, long,
long time ago.

838
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,040
That's the story,
so what can you do?

839
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:37,418
Let's see you play, Beryl.
Come on, you play.

840
01:11:37,584 --> 01:11:39,128
Boldness of attack.

841
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,426
Oh, that's good, Beryl.
That's good.

842
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:48,429
Oh, very good left hand.
Very good left hand.

843
01:11:48,595 --> 01:11:50,389
The point is, you've got
to share and care and care...

844
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:52,182
and share and just behave.
That's right, isn't it, Beryl?

845
01:11:52,349 --> 01:11:54,101
That's right,
that's right. Yes.

846
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:55,561
Very good. This is going to be
a stylish marriage, this is.

847
01:11:55,728 --> 01:11:58,731
It's a stylish marriage,
Beryl. It's a stylish marriage.

848
01:11:58,897 --> 01:12:01,942
Oh. Oh, that's very good,
Beryl, very good.

849
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:04,194
That's very good.

850
01:12:04,361 --> 01:12:05,946
Oh, that's very good.
Oh, press those pedals.

851
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,406
Oh, we're riding a bicycle,
Beryl.

852
01:12:07,615 --> 01:12:08,616
We're on a bicycle, Beryl.

853
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:09,867
Pedal, Beryl, pedal.

854
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:12,202
What goes on
in his head?

855
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,245
God only knows.

856
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:16,206
He's pretty confusing
in the best of times.

857
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,292
It's a complex disorder.

858
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:19,710
He kind of lives in
his own little world.

859
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:20,919
Poor lost soul.

860
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,171
Mmm, he's a sweetie.

861
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:26,133
He could leave tomorrow,
but he's got nowhere to go.

862
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,098
Come along, David.

863
01:12:33,265 --> 01:12:34,767
Beryl, Beryl, Beryl.

864
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:38,437
David, you know
I can't abide smoke.

865
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,023
Oh, sorry, Beryl.
Sorry.

866
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,107
What are you doing?

867
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,150
I'll walk. I'll walk.

868
01:12:43,317 --> 01:12:44,485
But you don't
know the way.

869
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:47,988
I'll follow you.
How does that sound?

870
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:49,698
It's all right.

871
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,617
Get in, David.

872
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:56,705
God bless you,
David Helfgott.

873
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,415
How's this, Beryl?
Is this all right?

874
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,980
Is that you, Nurse?

875
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:22,815
It's all right, David.
I'm here.

876
01:13:22,982 --> 01:13:24,316
Oh, here, here, never fear.

877
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:26,527
Oh, but where's the nurse?
Where's the sister, Beryl?

878
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:27,736
This is where
you live now, David.

879
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:29,530
Oh, that's right.

880
01:13:29,697 --> 01:13:31,198
I'm fine, I'm fine,
I'm fine, aren't I, Daisy?

881
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:32,616
Daisy, Beryl, Daisy.

882
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:35,244
This is where David Helfgott
really gets back on the rails.

883
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,579
Oh, that's the story.
That's the story.

884
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:38,789
No.

885
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,836
Mmm, oh, that's good,
Beryl.

886
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:01,353
Oh, don't you just love those
big, fat chords, Beryl?

887
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,721
The botanical garden's
just down the road--

888
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:36,805
nice walk.

889
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:40,934
You'll be able to come
and go as you please.

890
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:44,396
Mr. Minogue's a lovely man--
a real Christian gentleman.

891
01:14:44,605 --> 01:14:47,066
I know you're going
to like him, David.

892
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:48,609
And guess what?

893
01:14:48,776 --> 01:14:51,278
You'll even have
your own piano.

894
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,657
Very--very feathery.
Very feathery, very light.

895
01:15:56,844 --> 01:15:58,846
Shut up!

896
01:15:59,013 --> 01:16:01,015
Good morning, David.

897
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:02,975
Wakey-wakey.
Rise and shine.

898
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,561
It's breakfast time.

899
01:16:05,728 --> 01:16:08,480
I think it's about time
we gave that piano...

900
01:16:08,647 --> 01:16:09,773
another rest, eh,
David?

901
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:11,900
Here, sign your check.

902
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,612
Look at you. You should
get out and exercise.

903
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,155
Oh, exercise.
Y-yes, that's right.

904
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,824
Get some fresh air into those
lungs of yours, David.

905
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,451
Yeah, because the weak
get crushed like insects,

906
01:16:20,659 --> 01:16:21,827
don't they?

907
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,287
Like grasshoppers.

908
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:56,839
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

909
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,676
I hope you enjoyed
the music.

910
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:03,887
Bye.

911
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:05,055
Take care.

912
01:18:19,486 --> 01:18:21,238
We're closed.

913
01:19:12,331 --> 01:19:13,707
Sylvia...

914
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:14,917
your stray dog's back.

915
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:16,293
Do you want me
to get rid of him for you?

916
01:19:16,460 --> 01:19:17,461
No, I'll handle it.

917
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:21,548
Hey, baby,
what about a tune?

918
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:24,718
A tune, baby, sure.
No worries. No worries.

919
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:35,312
Oh, sock it to us,
Liberace.

920
01:19:35,479 --> 01:19:38,274
That's enough, Sam. David.

921
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,390
Fantastic.

922
01:20:53,557 --> 01:20:54,767
More!

923
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:08,572
Two more, please.

924
01:21:15,996 --> 01:21:16,956
Fantastic.

925
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,649
Oh, a hot one.
A live one.

926
01:21:43,857 --> 01:21:45,651
Yeah, hey, hey, give us
Beethoven's Fifth.

927
01:21:45,859 --> 01:21:48,362
Sure, babies, no worries.
Symphony or concerto?

928
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:14,763
See you soon.
See you soon.

929
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,933
Thanks for coming.
Bye-bye. See you soon.

930
01:22:26,984 --> 01:22:28,068
I played quite
well tonight, didn't I?

931
01:22:28,235 --> 01:22:29,486
I played quite well.

932
01:22:29,653 --> 01:22:31,280
I deserve
a bit of a snack.

933
01:22:31,447 --> 01:22:33,240
A bit of a snack.
You say...

934
01:22:36,744 --> 01:22:38,078
Hello, David.

935
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,708
Hello, Daddy. Hello.

936
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,379
Are you feeling well?

937
01:22:48,589 --> 01:22:50,049
Well, well, well,
the thing is the lid.

938
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,592
I can't--I can't--
I can't open this.

939
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:52,801
There's something
wrong with it.

940
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,804
What could be wrong,
David?

941
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:58,599
Oh, it's a mystery.
It's a mystery.

942
01:22:58,766 --> 01:23:00,225
Close it.

943
01:23:01,727 --> 01:23:02,811
Give it to me.

944
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,397
I'll show you.

945
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,462
You see...
how easy it is?

946
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,255
Couldn't be--
it couldn't be easier.

947
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,341
That's right.
Couldn't be easier.

948
01:23:32,508 --> 01:23:33,592
David.

949
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:39,932
Here...here.

950
01:23:49,984 --> 01:23:51,235
Look at me.

951
01:23:51,402 --> 01:23:53,988
You are a lucky boy,
David.

952
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,864
That's true. That's true.
It seems to be true.

953
01:23:56,031 --> 01:23:58,450
People--people say that--that--
that they think I'm--

954
01:23:58,617 --> 01:23:59,576
David.

955
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:01,954
Get to the point.

956
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:03,622
Yeah,
I'm a very lucky boy.

957
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,385
No one will
love you like me.

958
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,804
No one like me.

959
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:31,859
You see?
Do you realize what...

960
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:35,195
an opportunity
you have here?

961
01:24:35,362 --> 01:24:37,781
Opportunity of a lifetime.
That's right, Daddy.

962
01:24:37,948 --> 01:24:38,949
David.

963
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,244
When I was a boy...

964
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:48,000
I--I bought
a violin.

965
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:50,961
Beautiful violin.

966
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:53,756
I saved...

967
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,718
for this violin.

968
01:24:57,885 --> 01:25:02,264
You know
what...what happened to it.

969
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:06,268
You know
what happened...to it.

970
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:11,857
No, what happened to it,
Daddy? I don't--no idea.

971
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:14,068
What happened?
I've got no idea.

972
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:25,913
The--the thing is
you've got to be--

973
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:27,122
you've got to be fit
to survive, haven't you?

974
01:25:27,289 --> 01:25:29,208
To stay alive.
That's right, isn't it?

975
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,742
Good night, Daddy.

976
01:26:11,667 --> 01:26:13,127
Where are the kids?

977
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,879
Oh, around somewhere
amusing themselves.

978
01:26:18,090 --> 01:26:20,843
Oh, I must warn you. I've got
someone staying on weekends.

979
01:26:21,010 --> 01:26:22,511
But not another Scorpio,
is he?

980
01:26:22,678 --> 01:26:25,264
Oh, very funny, Gills.
He's a child prodigy.

981
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:28,892
David!

982
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:33,939
Thanks.

983
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:37,192
It's a madhouse.
David!

984
01:26:49,705 --> 01:26:51,832
Is that
the water running?

985
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,460
David!

986
01:26:55,753 --> 01:27:00,132
David...David?

987
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:04,345
Where in
God's heaven is he?

988
01:27:20,694 --> 01:27:24,156
Mum, David's been on
for an hour straight.

989
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:26,492
He's so cool.

990
01:27:26,659 --> 01:27:27,701
David!

991
01:27:27,868 --> 01:27:29,411
Is that you, doctor?

992
01:27:29,578 --> 01:27:31,747
There's no more hot water,
Sylvia. Where does it go?

993
01:27:31,914 --> 01:27:33,540
David, I want you
to meet someone.

994
01:27:33,707 --> 01:27:34,708
There's no more
hot water, Sylvia.

995
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:36,877
It's all gone.
All gone. All gone.

996
01:27:37,044 --> 01:27:38,128
Where does it go?

997
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,922
Who can say? I don't know.
Where does hot water go?

998
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:42,049
Gillian--Gillian's
a very dear friend of mine.

999
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:43,509
Oh, a friendly doctor.

1000
01:27:43,717 --> 01:27:44,718
I'm pleased
to meet you, David.

1001
01:27:44,885 --> 01:27:45,886
She's not a doctor.

1002
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:47,096
Oh, not a doctor, sweet Sylvia.
Not a doctor.

1003
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,180
She's an astrologer.

1004
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:49,223
A specialist.
A heart surgeon.

1005
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:50,349
She's from Sydney.

1006
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:51,350
Oh, an open
heart surgeon.

1007
01:27:51,517 --> 01:27:52,476
Don't be ridiculous.

1008
01:27:52,643 --> 01:27:53,644
I'm ridiculous.
I'm ridiculous. Aren't l...

1009
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:54,895
Gillian.
Gillian, that's it.

1010
01:27:55,062 --> 01:27:56,063
If your lucky, Gillian
might do your chart for you.

1011
01:27:56,230 --> 01:27:57,147
Oh, would she, Sylvia?
Would she?

1012
01:27:57,314 --> 01:27:58,232
Won't you, Gillian?

1013
01:27:58,399 --> 01:27:59,650
Of course I will,
David.

1014
01:27:59,817 --> 01:28:00,776
What sort of chart,
Sylvia?

1015
01:28:00,943 --> 01:28:01,860
An astrological chart.

1016
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,362
Oh, the stars. The stars.
I love the stars.

1017
01:28:03,529 --> 01:28:04,738
Astronomical variations.
The planets.

1018
01:28:04,905 --> 01:28:06,323
Oh, the planets.
Mustn't forget the planets.

1019
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,033
Of course, Mercury and Neptune
and so forth.

1020
01:28:08,242 --> 01:28:10,327
The music of the spheres.
If music be the food of love.

1021
01:28:10,494 --> 01:28:12,454
Very gastronomical,
isn't it, Gillian?

1022
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,164
Oh, the food of love, it is,
Gillian.

1023
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,793
What's he like when he gets
to know you better?

1024
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,378
Oh!

1025
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:14,058
So, what does he do?

1026
01:29:14,224 --> 01:29:16,560
Oh, he's an investment advisor.
That's how I met him.

1027
01:29:16,727 --> 01:29:19,563
Oh, so far so good.
How serious is it?

1028
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:20,648
Oh!

1029
01:29:20,814 --> 01:29:23,359
Oh, come on, Gills.
On a scale of one to ten.

1030
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:27,988
I'll take that
as a ten.

1031
01:29:28,155 --> 01:29:29,114
When's the happy day?

1032
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,743
God, you know me.
I hate to rush into things.

1033
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:37,748
I won't kiss you.

1034
01:29:37,957 --> 01:29:40,918
Oh, darling, oh.

1035
01:29:41,085 --> 01:29:43,379
Oh, Trish, Trish,
Trish, Trish.

1036
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:45,130
Oh, lovely,
gorgeous hair.

1037
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,423
Blondes have more fun,
don't they?

1038
01:29:46,590 --> 01:29:47,800
They have more fun.
'Course they do.

1039
01:29:47,967 --> 01:29:48,968
'Course they do.

1040
01:29:49,134 --> 01:29:50,803
There you are,
doctor.

1041
01:29:55,266 --> 01:29:56,892
Got to go to my room.
Got to go to my room.

1042
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:05,442
Oh, goodnight, Lucy.
Oh, juicy Lucy...

1043
01:30:20,708 --> 01:30:21,875
Mind if I come in?

1044
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,003
Oh, hello, doctor.
Entree. Entree.

1045
01:30:24,169 --> 01:30:26,297
Where will I put these?
Oh, sorry.

1046
01:30:26,463 --> 01:30:27,798
It's not your fault.
Not your fault.

1047
01:30:27,965 --> 01:30:30,342
lt--it's amazing. lt just seems
to be getting bigger.

1048
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:31,677
It's amazing what
you find, isn't it,

1049
01:30:31,885 --> 01:30:33,012
when you're not even looking.
But there he is. There he is.

1050
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:34,013
Who?

1051
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,472
Roger, Roger,
Roger, Roger.

1052
01:30:35,639 --> 01:30:37,057
Oh, Roger Woodward.

1053
01:30:37,224 --> 01:30:39,268
Oh, Roger, Roger.
Yeah, he's--he's a winner.

1054
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:41,270
He's a winner.

1055
01:30:41,437 --> 01:30:42,855
You've got one
going already.

1056
01:30:43,022 --> 01:30:44,898
He's a big hit.
He's a big hit.

1057
01:30:45,065 --> 01:30:47,067
Oh, one's more
than enough.

1058
01:30:47,234 --> 01:30:49,862
Yeah, I really
loved your playing.

1059
01:30:50,029 --> 01:30:52,406
Did you? Did you?
It was all right?

1060
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:53,866
Oh, do you write music
as well?

1061
01:30:54,033 --> 01:30:55,492
Oh, no, 1-2-3, oh,
that's the Rach 3.

1062
01:30:55,659 --> 01:30:57,369
It started out
being a letter.

1063
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:58,829
Oh, that, Gillian.
I think--I think it was.

1064
01:30:58,996 --> 01:30:59,997
I think so.
It seems to be true.

1065
01:31:00,205 --> 01:31:01,915
"Dear Professor Cecil,
Royal College--"

1066
01:31:02,082 --> 01:31:03,459
Of Music.
Royal College of Music.

1067
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:04,460
It's a mystery.
It's a mystery.

1068
01:31:04,627 --> 01:31:05,711
What is?

1069
01:31:05,919 --> 01:31:07,838
Well, he only had one arm,
you see? lt was a stroke.

1070
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,006
Poor thing.

1071
01:31:09,214 --> 01:31:10,674
Yeah, poor, poor pussycat.
Poor, poor pussycat.

1072
01:31:10,883 --> 01:31:13,427
He was...his paw was damaged
beyond repair.

1073
01:31:13,594 --> 01:31:14,678
He wasn't able to do
a thing with it.

1074
01:31:14,887 --> 01:31:17,556
He was a sad, sad pussycat.
He was--he was damaged.

1075
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:20,100
And it was just bad luck really,
wasn't it?

1076
01:31:20,267 --> 01:31:21,268
I'm not damaging you,
am I?

1077
01:31:21,435 --> 01:31:23,312
Oh, not at all.

1078
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:25,689
What's the matter,
David?

1079
01:31:25,898 --> 01:31:27,066
Oh, the matter.
The matter, the matter.

1080
01:31:27,232 --> 01:31:28,984
Oh, it started out being--
but it's a blank. It's a blank.

1081
01:31:29,151 --> 01:31:31,654
It was all--it was all
such a long, time ago, Gillian.

1082
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,614
And that's the story,
what can you do?

1083
01:31:33,781 --> 01:31:35,532
lnexpressible.
lnexplicably inexpressible.

1084
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:36,951
To--to express
the inexplicable.

1085
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,328
Well, why don't you tell me
what you want to say?

1086
01:31:39,495 --> 01:31:41,246
Oh, why not? Why not?
What don't I want to say?

1087
01:31:41,413 --> 01:31:42,373
Oh, that's
a hard one.

1088
01:31:42,581 --> 01:31:45,376
No, it's not hard at all.
Look, d-e-a-r, dear--

1089
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:46,669
That's it. That's it.
That's it. Dear--dear--dear.

1090
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,670
Dear Cecil?

1091
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:48,879
-Deary me. Deary me.
-Cecil?

1092
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:49,922
Cecil was Parkes.
Cecil was Parkes.

1093
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:51,090
Dear Mr. Parkes.

1094
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:52,591
He touched the soul of
Sergei Vasilievitch himself

1095
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,676
with the Rach 3
in D minor.

1096
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:54,969
So that wasn't too bad,
was it?

1097
01:31:55,135 --> 01:31:56,720
It's a hard piece
for elephants--elephantine.

1098
01:31:56,929 --> 01:31:58,305
Dear Mr. Parkes...

1099
01:31:58,472 --> 01:31:59,306
It was such a long time ago.
Such a long time, you know?

1100
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:01,600
It has been
such a long time.

1101
01:32:01,809 --> 01:32:02,768
Such a long time.

1102
01:32:02,935 --> 01:32:04,186
And l...

1103
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:06,146
And l--and I hope--
hope, Gillian.

1104
01:32:06,313 --> 01:32:07,314
How does that sound?
Is that all right?

1105
01:32:07,481 --> 01:32:08,983
It sounds pretty good
to me.

1106
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:11,360
Ah, and I hope you remember me
and the Rach 3.

1107
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,945
I'm--I'm feeling
much better again now.

1108
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:14,029
I'm feeling much
better again, aren't I?

1109
01:32:14,196 --> 01:32:17,574
Yeah, and--and I've started
playing again.

1110
01:32:45,853 --> 01:32:50,691
Well done, Roger.
Oh, yeah! Oh!

1111
01:32:52,276 --> 01:32:54,069
That was good.

1112
01:33:19,345 --> 01:33:19,887
Smile, David.

1113
01:33:19,887 --> 01:33:21,263
Smile, David.

1114
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:22,389
I am, Sylvia.

1115
01:33:22,556 --> 01:33:23,766
At the camera, here.

1116
01:33:23,933 --> 01:33:26,185
-Hurray!
-Hurray!

1117
01:33:26,352 --> 01:33:27,227
Time to go.

1118
01:33:27,394 --> 01:33:28,354
Oh, well,
what can you do?

1119
01:33:28,520 --> 01:33:29,438
David, look on
the bright side.

1120
01:33:29,605 --> 01:33:30,481
The bright side.
The silver lining.

1121
01:33:30,648 --> 01:33:31,690
You'll see Gillian
again one day.

1122
01:33:31,899 --> 01:33:33,025
Yes, life goes on.

1123
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:34,401
It does. lt does--
is that what it does?

1124
01:33:34,568 --> 01:33:35,569
Yes, of course it does.

1125
01:33:35,736 --> 01:33:36,779
David, she has to go.

1126
01:33:36,946 --> 01:33:37,947
Oh, yeah, little wrigglies
to look after.

1127
01:33:38,113 --> 01:33:40,199
Oh, hardly. No, my kids
are all grown up.

1128
01:33:40,407 --> 01:33:41,617
It's just little old me.

1129
01:33:41,784 --> 01:33:44,745
It's just me, too.
I never grew up, I grew down.

1130
01:33:44,912 --> 01:33:46,080
I'm a bit
of a handful--

1131
01:33:46,246 --> 01:33:48,457
bit of a handful,
Gillian, aren't I?

1132
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:50,542
Softly, softly,
softly.

1133
01:33:50,709 --> 01:33:52,252
Softly.

1134
01:33:53,629 --> 01:33:54,672
Will you marry me?

1135
01:33:59,343 --> 01:34:00,928
Well, it wouldn't be
very practical, David.

1136
01:34:01,095 --> 01:34:02,680
Practical. No, of course not.
Of course not.

1137
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:04,431
But then neither am I, Gillian.
Neither am l.

1138
01:34:04,598 --> 01:34:05,975
I'm not very
practical at all.

1139
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,518
You'll miss the plane.

1140
01:34:07,685 --> 01:34:09,228
It's sweet of you,
David.

1141
01:34:10,271 --> 01:34:11,438
I don't know
what to say.

1142
01:34:11,605 --> 01:34:14,566
The stars, Gillian, darling.
Ask the stars.

1143
01:35:49,244 --> 01:35:50,996
You'd better let
her breathe, David.

1144
01:36:00,714 --> 01:36:03,550
Oh, I won't kiss you.
I won't kiss you.

1145
01:36:03,717 --> 01:36:04,885
Oh!

1146
01:36:26,782 --> 01:36:27,741
Sorry, darling.

1147
01:36:27,908 --> 01:36:29,368
Oh, that's all right.

1148
01:36:31,412 --> 01:36:35,291
You made a noise.

1149
01:36:35,457 --> 01:36:37,376
David!

1150
01:36:53,892 --> 01:36:56,312
Oh, no. Poor Ravel.

1151
01:36:56,478 --> 01:36:59,607
Oh, poor Maurice. He's all
unraveled. All unraveled--

1152
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:01,400
It's nearly time
to get ready.

1153
01:37:01,609 --> 01:37:02,735
Can I swim some more,
darling?

1154
01:37:02,943 --> 01:37:04,069
Oh, all right.
Ten minutes.

1155
01:37:04,236 --> 01:37:06,572
Do some Liszt.
Not a concerto.

1156
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:09,033
Swim
La Campanella.

1157
01:37:09,199 --> 01:37:10,993
That should do it.

1158
01:37:14,788 --> 01:37:16,749
Oh, I've gone wrong, darling.
I've gone wrong.

1159
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:17,916
Well, keep trying,
darling.

1160
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:19,460
I'm trying.
I'm very trying.

1161
01:37:19,627 --> 01:37:21,378
Page 37's missing.

1162
01:37:21,545 --> 01:37:23,547
Oh, it's the coda.
It's the end.

1163
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:24,673
It's the beginning
of the end.

1164
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:27,217
Oh, I'll soak my hands.
I'll soak my hands.

1165
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:28,594
David!

1166
01:37:34,308 --> 01:37:35,476
Gotcha!

1167
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:42,358
Your first concert in years
and you wear odd shoes.

1168
01:37:42,524 --> 01:37:43,484
Oh, I'm a sausage.

1169
01:37:43,651 --> 01:37:44,860
You certainly are.

1170
01:37:45,027 --> 01:37:47,821
Sit.
No, up straight.

1171
01:37:47,988 --> 01:37:48,948
We'll be in the car.

1172
01:37:49,156 --> 01:37:50,074
Relax.

1173
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,450
Oh, relax.
I must learn to relax.

1174
01:37:51,617 --> 01:37:52,576
Must learn to relax.

1175
01:37:52,743 --> 01:37:54,536
Shh.

1176
01:37:54,703 --> 01:37:56,705
Perfect.

1177
01:38:44,253 --> 01:38:46,505
Bravo!

1178
01:38:49,925 --> 01:38:51,844
Bravo!

1179
01:38:59,101 --> 01:39:00,769
My darling.

1180
01:39:00,936 --> 01:39:02,646
They want an encore,
David.

1181
01:39:02,813 --> 01:39:04,023
Do they, darling?
They want some more?

1182
01:39:04,231 --> 01:39:05,149
What are you going to do?

1183
01:39:05,316 --> 01:39:06,191
I'm going to win.

1184
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:07,484
Not now, darling.

1185
01:39:07,651 --> 01:39:08,861
I'll do some more.
I'll do some more.

1186
01:39:09,028 --> 01:39:10,112
Do some more.

1187
01:40:09,338 --> 01:40:12,007
What do you feel?

1188
01:40:12,174 --> 01:40:14,426
Well, the thing is
I feel nothing.

1189
01:40:14,593 --> 01:40:16,262
Nothing at all?

1190
01:40:16,428 --> 01:40:17,846
Well, I'm shocked, stunned,

1191
01:40:18,013 --> 01:40:20,683
and completely amazed.
How does that sound?

1192
01:40:20,849 --> 01:40:21,934
Perhaps
it's all my fault.

1193
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,310
Perhaps it's me.
Perhaps I don't know.

1194
01:40:23,477 --> 01:40:24,937
You can't go on
blaming yourself...

1195
01:40:25,104 --> 01:40:26,021
for everything
that's happened.

1196
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:27,231
Well, you can't go
on blaming yourself.

1197
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:28,399
That's true, Gillian.

1198
01:40:28,565 --> 01:40:29,483
And you can't go on
blaming Daddy...

1199
01:40:29,650 --> 01:40:30,526
because he's not
here anymore.

1200
01:40:30,693 --> 01:40:31,819
-But you are.
-And I am here.

1201
01:40:31,986 --> 01:40:34,863
That's true. And life goes on,
doesn't it, Gillian?

1202
01:40:35,030 --> 01:40:35,948
Is that right?
Is that right?

1203
01:40:36,115 --> 01:40:37,449
But it does. lt does.
Forever and ever. Oh!

1204
01:40:37,616 --> 01:40:38,534
Not forever.

1205
01:40:38,701 --> 01:40:40,452
No, no, never forever.
Not quite. Not quite.

1206
01:40:40,619 --> 01:40:42,746
But I mean, the point is life's
not all lamb loin chops, is it?

1207
01:40:42,913 --> 01:40:44,081
But I mean, it goes on
and--and you just...

1208
01:40:44,248 --> 01:40:45,708
have to keep on going,
too, don't you?

1209
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:47,084
I mean, you can't
give up, can you?

1210
01:40:47,251 --> 01:40:49,712
Certainly not. Every time that
blooming Saturn comes along,

1211
01:40:49,878 --> 01:40:50,963
it gives us a bit of a jolt.

1212
01:40:51,171 --> 01:40:53,132
Oh, it's the stars,
Gillian.

1213
01:40:53,299 --> 01:40:54,216
Everything has its season.

1214
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:55,634
Oh, it's a mystery.
It's a mystery.

1215
01:40:55,801 --> 01:40:56,969
There's always a reason.

1216
01:40:57,136 --> 01:41:00,055
Oh, we just need to seize
the reason for the season.
