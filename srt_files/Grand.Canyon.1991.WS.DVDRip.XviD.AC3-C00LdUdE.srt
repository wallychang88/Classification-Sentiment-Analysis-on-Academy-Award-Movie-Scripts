1
00:02:42,528 --> 00:02:43,552
Yes!

2
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:17,528
Whoa!

3
00:03:59,238 --> 00:04:01,229
You know what
your problem is?

4
00:04:01,306 --> 00:04:02,898
You're always
talking about "X,"

5
00:04:02,975 --> 00:04:04,237
but thinking
about "Y."

6
00:04:04,309 --> 00:04:06,402
Learn to talk
about "Y."

7
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:07,570
Forget about "X."

8
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:10,581
"X" is going to take
care of itself.

9
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:11,911
What are you
talking about?

10
00:04:11,984 --> 00:04:14,418
Hear yourself. Listen to
what you're really saying

11
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,420
and to what you
think you're saying.

12
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:19,423
When are you going to realize
nothing can be controlled?

13
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:20,583
We live in chaos,

14
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:22,786
a central issue
in everyone's life.

15
00:04:22,861 --> 00:04:24,294
Mack, look around you.

16
00:04:24,363 --> 00:04:27,799
Everyone in this parking lot
is struggling for control.

17
00:04:27,866 --> 00:04:30,767
You know what it is
they're trying to control,

18
00:04:30,836 --> 00:04:32,497
each and
every one of them?

19
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,936
Fear.

20
00:04:34,006 --> 00:04:36,839
They're trying
to control their fear.

21
00:04:41,747 --> 00:04:42,941
Thanks for
the game, Davis.

22
00:04:43,015 --> 00:04:45,449
You're my best friend.
This is important.

23
00:04:45,517 --> 00:04:46,609
Let's talk tomorrow.

24
00:04:46,685 --> 00:04:47,879
Good night, Mack.

25
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,079
Good night, Vanessa.

26
00:04:49,154 --> 00:04:51,588
I have more to say
about this.

27
00:04:51,657 --> 00:04:52,954
Vanessa, why is it

28
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:54,959
when someone's successful
in one field,

29
00:04:55,027 --> 00:04:57,154
they think they know
about everything?

30
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:58,594
Drive carefully.

31
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,921
<i>... should be heard</i>
<i>on this subject.</i>

32
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,933
<i>Missiles can accomplish</i>
<i>at a cheaper price</i>

33
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:47,437
<i>and greater accuracy</i>
<i>and fewer casualties</i>

34
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:48,938
<i>the mission, that, uh,</i>

35
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:51,941
<i>that a pilot was</i>
<i>supposed to carry out</i>

36
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,943
<i>and did in</i>
<i>previous wars.</i>

37
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:57,947
<i>And the Air Force is very</i>
<i>resistant to changing...</i>

38
00:06:58,015 --> 00:07:00,483
Dad should be home soon.
The game just ended.

39
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:01,916
I thought
you were studying

40
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:03,283
for your English exam.

41
00:07:03,354 --> 00:07:05,879
I was. I had
the game on the radio.

42
00:07:05,957 --> 00:07:07,117
Oh.

43
00:07:07,191 --> 00:07:11,628
Oh, um, can you pick me up
tomorrow at, uh, 4:30?

44
00:07:11,696 --> 00:07:12,958
4:30,
behind the school?

45
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,362
I thought you
were going to get

46
00:07:15,433 --> 00:07:16,422
a ride occasionally.

47
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,401
I try. It's just hard
to arrange to leave

48
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:20,903
at exactly the same time
with someone.

49
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:22,234
It's just hard for me

50
00:07:22,306 --> 00:07:24,900
to arrange my afternoon
around picking you up.

51
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,240
I'm working at the
senior center tomorrow.

52
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,803
If you can't do it,
I can try to find a ride.

53
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:32,281
It's kind of late,

54
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,749
but...

55
00:07:33,818 --> 00:07:35,285
thanks.

56
00:07:35,353 --> 00:07:38,516
Mom, I think you
need to get organized.

57
00:08:15,459 --> 00:08:17,359
Mmm. Uh... fuck!

58
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:22,865
God.

59
00:08:22,934 --> 00:08:24,367
What the...

60
00:08:26,437 --> 00:08:28,564
All right! All right!

61
00:08:35,446 --> 00:08:36,378
Oh...

62
00:08:36,447 --> 00:08:37,379
shit.

63
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:38,380
God.

64
00:08:38,449 --> 00:08:40,212
Fuck! Fuck!

65
00:08:40,284 --> 00:08:41,308
Fuck.

66
00:08:55,466 --> 00:08:57,400
Operator 349.
What city, please?

67
00:08:57,468 --> 00:08:59,402
Yeah, I need
road service

68
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:02,837
for, um, I don't know.
Let's say Inglewood.

69
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,001
Hello... God.

70
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:12,905
Damn!

71
00:09:14,418 --> 00:09:16,352
Yeah, uh, Buckingham,

72
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:19,514
but remember it's
about a half mile, uh...

73
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,524
west, I guess, of there.

74
00:09:21,592 --> 00:09:24,527
It should be about
a 45-minute wait.

75
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:26,028
Uh-huh. I understand,

76
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:28,861
but, see, uh,
if it takes that long,

77
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,026
I might be, like, dead.

78
00:09:31,102 --> 00:09:33,036
You might call
the police.

79
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,036
The police.

80
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:35,868
Oh, shit. No, uh...

81
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,032
nothing's happened.

82
00:09:37,108 --> 00:09:40,202
Just get the truck here
as fast as you can.

83
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,370
Will do, sir.

84
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:20,750
Mayday. Mayday.
We're going down.

85
00:10:39,003 --> 00:10:39,935
Hey, man.

86
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:41,938
You need some
help here?

87
00:10:42,006 --> 00:10:43,598
This a nice car,
mister.

88
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:44,936
This one of them
new Jap cars?

89
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:46,033
Yeah.

90
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,738
Yeah, you need help
or yeah, it's a Jap car?

91
00:10:48,813 --> 00:10:50,246
Thanks. Uh, no.

92
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:53,306
I've already called
for the, uh, tow truck

93
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:54,442
and the police.

94
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:56,452
You called the police?
What?

95
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,455
On that phone, you
called all those people?

96
00:10:59,523 --> 00:11:01,889
Who else you call,
your mama?

97
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,551
He been busy, man.

98
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:04,924
I see.

99
00:11:04,996 --> 00:11:07,988
Nice car. I could use
a car with a phone.

100
00:11:08,065 --> 00:11:10,625
Maybe you wants
a ride somewhere.

101
00:11:10,701 --> 00:11:13,135
Want a jump start
or something?

102
00:11:13,204 --> 00:11:14,671
How about a jump start?

103
00:11:15,873 --> 00:11:18,398
Ooh, he nervous, y'all.

104
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,467
What you so nervous
about, man?

105
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,977
Maybe he carrying, Jim.

106
00:11:22,046 --> 00:11:24,105
Maybe he's scared
we going to bust him.

107
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:25,671
Bust his ass.

108
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,412
Leave that
man alone!

109
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:30,511
O.K., Grandma.

110
00:11:30,588 --> 00:11:31,714
Whatever, baby.

111
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,288
Why don't you get out
of the car, mister?

112
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:45,027
You want me to have
Jimmy take you out?

113
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,933
Or how about this...

114
00:11:47,004 --> 00:11:50,906
Do you ever want to get
out of that car again?

115
00:11:57,014 --> 00:11:58,948
Look, what do you want?

116
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:01,382
Do you want my wallet,
my watch?

117
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:03,977
It's a shitty watch.
You're welcome to it.

118
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:06,421
I want you
out of the car.

119
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:08,287
Let's get this shit
over with.

120
00:12:08,359 --> 00:12:10,428
Now, motherfucker.

121
00:12:56,507 --> 00:12:59,442
Which one of you
call for the truck?

122
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,943
Me. That was me.

123
00:13:01,011 --> 00:13:04,037
Uh, this is it.
It just sort of died.

124
00:13:04,114 --> 00:13:06,048
I'm the one
that called.

125
00:13:07,451 --> 00:13:09,885
I guess
it was you, huh?

126
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:10,886
Yeah.

127
00:13:10,955 --> 00:13:13,389
Hey, man, we was
doing fine here.

128
00:13:13,457 --> 00:13:14,890
Uh, is it the battery?

129
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,051
Huh?

130
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,890
Were you stopped, and
it wouldn't start again?

131
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:21,898
Oh, no. I-It just
died on me.

132
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,400
We're going to have
to take it in.

133
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,903
You dissin' me, man?

134
00:13:27,972 --> 00:13:29,405
You bet he is.

135
00:13:29,473 --> 00:13:30,963
You seeing it now, man.

136
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,633
That's right.
That's what he's doing.

137
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,610
Is that right,
you dissin' me?

138
00:13:34,678 --> 00:13:36,111
No, I'm not.

139
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,408
Nothing like it.

140
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:41,178
I'm doing a job. This
is how I make my living.

141
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:44,688
I just ride out there
and do the job.

142
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:47,918
I want it to go
as smooth as it can.

143
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:51,393
I don't like it to be
harder than it is.

144
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,986
Make sure you're
in neutral

145
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,997
and the parking brake
is off.

146
00:14:03,641 --> 00:14:04,869
That's bullshit, man.

147
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,375
He talking bullshit.

148
00:14:06,443 --> 00:14:08,741
What's goin' down?
This is fucked up.

149
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,391
Get in the truck.

150
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,393
You'll ride up with me.

151
00:14:28,599 --> 00:14:30,430
Are you the one
I'm talking to?

152
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,731
We all decide
what goes down,

153
00:14:32,803 --> 00:14:34,566
so don't fly
that shit.

154
00:14:34,638 --> 00:14:36,765
Yeah, man. Fuck you!

155
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,900
Am I talking
to the right man?

156
00:14:42,479 --> 00:14:44,344
That's what I thought.

157
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:49,184
Look, I got
to ask you a favor.

158
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:53,417
I got to ask you
to let me go my way here.

159
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:56,357
Now, this truck
is my responsibility.

160
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,258
Now that the car's
hooked up to it,

161
00:14:58,329 --> 00:14:59,921
I'm responsible
for that, too.

162
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:02,864
Any shit comes down now,
it's my ass.

163
00:15:02,933 --> 00:15:03,865
Follow me?

164
00:15:03,934 --> 00:15:05,697
Do you think
I'm stupid?

165
00:15:05,769 --> 00:15:07,862
Answer me that first.
Then we'll talk.

166
00:15:07,938 --> 00:15:09,371
Look, I don't know
nothin' about you.

167
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,032
You don't know nothin'
about me.

168
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:14,407
I don't know if you're
stupid or some kinda genius,

169
00:15:14,478 --> 00:15:15,877
but I do know this.

170
00:15:15,946 --> 00:15:19,882
I got to get out of here,
and you got the gun.

171
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:23,386
So I'm asking you a favor
for the second time.

172
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,547
Let me go my way here.

173
00:15:25,623 --> 00:15:27,887
I'm going to grant you
that favor,

174
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,392
and I'm going to expect
you remember this

175
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:33,123
if we ever meet again.

176
00:15:33,197 --> 00:15:34,391
Yeah.

177
00:15:34,465 --> 00:15:35,432
But first,

178
00:15:35,499 --> 00:15:38,400
you got to answer
one more thing for me,

179
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,198
and you got
to tell me the truth.

180
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,828
Are you
asking me a favor

181
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,065
as a sign of respect,

182
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:45,074
or are you
asking me a favor

183
00:15:45,142 --> 00:15:46,404
'cause I got the gun?

184
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,416
Man, the world ain't
supposed to work like this.

185
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,418
Maybe you
don't know that,

186
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:58,421
but this ain't the way
it's supposed to be.

187
00:15:58,489 --> 00:16:01,356
I'm supposed to be able
to do my job

188
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,359
without asking you
if I can.

189
00:16:03,427 --> 00:16:06,863
That dude should is supposed
to be able to wait with his car

190
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,363
without you
ripping him off.

191
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:11,868
Everything's supposed to be
different than what it is.

192
00:16:11,935 --> 00:16:14,267
So what's your answer?

193
00:16:14,338 --> 00:16:16,135
You don't have the gun,

194
00:16:16,206 --> 00:16:18,106
we ain't having
this conversation.

195
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,871
That's what I thought.

196
00:16:20,944 --> 00:16:22,878
No gun, no respect.

197
00:16:22,946 --> 00:16:25,881
That's why I always
got the gun.

198
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,119
Thanks.

199
00:17:15,432 --> 00:17:17,024
You saved my ass.

200
00:17:22,172 --> 00:17:23,605
We both got lucky.

201
00:17:23,674 --> 00:17:26,142
It could have gone
different.

202
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,872
What's going on
in the world?

203
00:17:28,946 --> 00:17:32,712
This neighborhood
has gone to shit.

204
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:35,718
This country
has gone to shit.

205
00:17:35,786 --> 00:17:38,755
My sister and her kids
live near here.

206
00:18:47,457 --> 00:18:49,391
<i>That was a joke, Frasier.</i>

207
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:52,394
<i>Oh, I forgot</i>
<i>I married a madcap.</i>

208
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:53,895
<i>Hey, uh, listen, folks.</i>

209
00:18:53,964 --> 00:18:55,898
<i>Nobody's interested</i>
<i>in your motor trip.</i>

210
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>my upcoming surgery.</i>

211
00:18:58,468 --> 00:18:59,901
<i>Now, where was I?</i>

212
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,337
<i>So you're going to</i>
<i>see the Grand Canyon?</i>

213
00:19:03,407 --> 00:19:04,965
<i>Don't miss Yosemite.</i>

214
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:07,340
<i>Go to the alligator farm</i>
<i>outside Tallahassee.</i>

215
00:19:07,411 --> 00:19:10,073
<i>Tell Ivar</i>
<i>Woody says, "hey, hey."</i>

216
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:12,715
Hey, Ma.

217
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:20,348
Hey, baby.
How you doing?

218
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,359
I'm all right.

219
00:19:25,428 --> 00:19:26,861
What time is it?

220
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,862
11:30.

221
00:19:27,931 --> 00:19:29,398
Mmm.

222
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:31,825
What's up?

223
00:19:32,936 --> 00:19:34,096
What's up?

224
00:19:35,638 --> 00:19:37,071
Kelley's going to be

225
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,040
in the Girl Scouts
next year.

226
00:19:39,109 --> 00:19:40,041
Yeah?

227
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,042
Mm-hmm.

228
00:19:41,111 --> 00:19:44,080
I have to get her
a uniform.

229
00:19:45,782 --> 00:19:46,806
Ooh!

230
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:48,282
I'm going to bed.

231
00:19:54,457 --> 00:19:55,890
Sleep tight, baby.

232
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:57,324
Good night, Ma.

233
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,901
<i>It was more slow time</i>

234
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:08,403
<i>than Showtime</i>
<i>earlier this season.</i>

235
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,769
<i>The Lakers were simply</i>
<i>out of sync.</i>

236
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,068
<i>But a stifling defense</i>

237
00:20:12,142 --> 00:20:13,734
<i>and a return of</i>
<i>that patented running game</i>

238
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:14,936
<i>has catapulted L.A. back</i>

239
00:20:15,011 --> 00:20:17,912
<i>into serious contention</i>
<i>in the west.</i>

240
00:20:17,981 --> 00:20:20,916
<i>They're now just a game and</i>
<i>a half back of the Blazers</i>

241
00:20:20,984 --> 00:20:23,009
<i>after ending Orlando's</i>
<i>magical road run.</i>

242
00:20:23,086 --> 00:20:25,418
<i>Magic was hot as they</i>
<i>put up everything.</i>

243
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:27,422
<i>Dunleavy wanted a timeout.</i>

244
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,924
<i>His team was down by 10.</i>

245
00:20:29,993 --> 00:20:32,427
<i>Here's Earvin Johnson</i>
<i>missing the lay-up.</i>

246
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,929
<i>This is Sam Vincent</i>
<i>of Orlando.</i>

247
00:20:34,998 --> 00:20:36,932
<i>Three on one, the Iceman.</i>

248
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,934
<i>Jerry Reynolds</i>
<i>stuffing over Teagle.</i>

249
00:20:39,002 --> 00:20:42,199
<i>The Lakers got hot</i>
<i>and went on a 20-point win.</i>

250
00:20:43,273 --> 00:20:44,240
Hello?

251
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:45,239
Hello?

252
00:20:45,308 --> 00:20:46,935
Hi, guys.

253
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,102
Mack, what's wrong?

254
00:20:48,178 --> 00:20:49,941
Nothing. I'm fine.
The car died.

255
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:50,945
Where?

256
00:20:51,014 --> 00:20:52,208
Near the Forum.

257
00:20:52,282 --> 00:20:53,214
Oh, shit.

258
00:20:53,283 --> 00:20:54,307
Roberto.

259
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:55,351
On Manchester?

260
00:20:55,418 --> 00:20:57,943
No, no. Like an idiot
I took a shortcut

261
00:20:58,021 --> 00:20:59,113
and got turned around.

262
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:01,885
You've never been
where I broke down.

263
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:03,892
Shit. Are you out
of there now?

264
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,427
Yeah. I'm at a gas station.

265
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:06,689
Good.

266
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,196
You're lucky you got
out with your life.

267
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:09,731
It could have been
curtains, Dad.

268
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,266
Roberto,
could I talk?

269
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:12,892
See you
tomorrow, Dad.

270
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:14,766
Good night, pal.

271
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,066
You want me
to come and get you?

272
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:18,903
Nah. If they don't finish,
I'll take a cab.

273
00:21:18,975 --> 00:21:21,842
Sleep. I'll tell about
my adventure tomorrow.

274
00:21:21,911 --> 00:21:23,401
Adventure?
Mack, what happened?

275
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,414
Are you all right?

276
00:21:25,482 --> 00:21:26,574
I'm fine.

277
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:27,911
Go to bed, honey.

278
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,417
I love you.

279
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:30,919
Love you, too.

280
00:21:30,987 --> 00:21:32,477
Bye.

281
00:21:41,798 --> 00:21:44,926
You can go swimming
in the ocean every day

282
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:46,935
and be perfectly cool,
you know.

283
00:21:47,003 --> 00:21:49,437
Then one day,
one particular day,

284
00:21:49,506 --> 00:21:51,440
you bump into
the big shark.

285
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:53,942
The big shark
don't hate you.

286
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:55,443
He's got no feeling
for you at all.

287
00:21:55,512 --> 00:21:57,946
You look
like food to him.

288
00:21:58,014 --> 00:22:00,949
You don't hate
hamburger, do you, huh?

289
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:02,746
Yeah.

290
00:22:04,954 --> 00:22:07,445
Those boys back there,

291
00:22:07,524 --> 00:22:09,389
they ain't got
nothing to lose.

292
00:22:09,459 --> 00:22:12,394
If you just happen
to be swimming along

293
00:22:12,462 --> 00:22:15,022
and bump into them,
well...

294
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:24,406
It might not be
worth worrying about.

295
00:22:24,474 --> 00:22:27,409
It's like being
in a plane crash.

296
00:22:27,477 --> 00:22:28,569
Well,
that's comforting.

297
00:22:28,645 --> 00:22:30,272
I'm glad you
brought that up.

298
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:34,407
There just seems to be
so many ways to buy it,

299
00:22:34,484 --> 00:22:38,079
particularly
in this city.

300
00:22:38,154 --> 00:22:40,179
I'm amazed at
the end of each day

301
00:22:40,256 --> 00:22:42,588
that anybody's alive.

302
00:22:42,659 --> 00:22:43,921
Then other days I think

303
00:22:43,993 --> 00:22:45,585
that maybe people
aren't so fragile.

304
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:48,597
Things have always
been kind of brutal,

305
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:50,326
and people just
keep on going.

306
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,927
You ever been
to the Grand Canyon?

307
00:22:54,003 --> 00:22:55,937
I always meant to go.

308
00:22:56,005 --> 00:22:57,438
I was there.

309
00:22:57,507 --> 00:23:00,442
It only takes about
nine hours from here.

310
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,876
I know. We were planning
to take my boy.

311
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:04,379
How old is he?

312
00:23:04,447 --> 00:23:05,471
15.

313
00:23:05,548 --> 00:23:08,381
15? Probably won't
want to go with you now,

314
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:09,884
probably go
with his friends

315
00:23:09,953 --> 00:23:11,318
and his chick now.

316
00:23:11,387 --> 00:23:12,786
You've missed
that boat.

317
00:23:12,855 --> 00:23:14,288
What's his name?

318
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:15,289
Roberto.

319
00:23:15,358 --> 00:23:16,290
Roberto.

320
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,587
After Roberto Clemente.

321
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,890
No shit.

322
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:23,899
Man, get yourself
to the Grand Canyon.

323
00:23:23,967 --> 00:23:25,059
Beautiful, huh?

324
00:23:25,134 --> 00:23:28,399
It's pretty, but that's
not the thing of it.

325
00:23:28,471 --> 00:23:31,907
You can sit right
on the edge of it.

326
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:33,909
I did that.
I did everything.

327
00:23:33,977 --> 00:23:36,912
I went down in it,
stayed overnight there.

328
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,914
The thing that got me

329
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,917
was sitting on the edge
of that big old thing.

330
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:44,920
Those cliffs and rocks,
they're so old.

331
00:23:44,988 --> 00:23:46,717
It took so long
for that thing

332
00:23:46,789 --> 00:23:48,916
to get to look
like that.

333
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,425
It ain't done either.

334
00:23:50,493 --> 00:23:51,460
It happens right while

335
00:23:51,527 --> 00:23:52,926
you're sitting there
watching it.

336
00:23:52,996 --> 00:23:54,429
It's happening right now

337
00:23:54,497 --> 00:23:57,432
while we're sitting here
in this ugly town.

338
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,933
Yeah.

339
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,373
When you sit on the edge
of that thing,

340
00:24:07,443 --> 00:24:09,877
you just realize what
a joke we people are.

341
00:24:09,946 --> 00:24:12,847
What big heads we got,
thinking that what we do

342
00:24:12,915 --> 00:24:14,382
is gonna matter
all that much,

343
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,883
thinking our time here

344
00:24:15,952 --> 00:24:17,385
means diddly
to those rocks.

345
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:19,887
It's a split second
we've been here,

346
00:24:19,956 --> 00:24:21,389
the whole lot of us.

347
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,890
And one of us?

348
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:26,190
That's a piece of time
too small to get a name.

349
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:27,889
You trying
to cheer me up?

350
00:24:27,964 --> 00:24:30,899
Yeah. Those rocks
are laughing at me.

351
00:24:30,967 --> 00:24:32,400
I could tell.

352
00:24:32,468 --> 00:24:33,901
Me and my worries

353
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:37,406
is real humorous to
that Grand Canyon.

354
00:24:37,473 --> 00:24:40,408
Hey, you know
what I felt like?

355
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:42,410
I felt like a gnat

356
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:44,912
that lands
on the ass of a cow

357
00:24:44,981 --> 00:24:47,108
that's chewing its cud
next to the road

358
00:24:47,183 --> 00:24:49,242
that you ride by on
at 70 miles an hour.

359
00:24:49,318 --> 00:24:50,250
Small.

360
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:51,752
Oh, yes...

361
00:24:51,821 --> 00:24:53,015
it's small.

362
00:24:55,992 --> 00:24:57,926
My name is Mack.

363
00:24:57,994 --> 00:25:00,087
Yeah?

364
00:25:00,163 --> 00:25:01,255
Simon.

365
00:25:14,544 --> 00:25:15,476
<i>Oh!</i>

366
00:25:15,545 --> 00:25:16,807
<i>No!</i>

367
00:25:16,879 --> 00:25:17,868
<i>Aah!</i>

368
00:25:17,947 --> 00:25:19,039
<i>Aah!</i>

369
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:23,880
<i>I said left!</i>
<i>I told you left!</i>

370
00:25:25,455 --> 00:25:27,855
<i>You scum-sucking pig!</i>

371
00:25:27,924 --> 00:25:29,323
<i>I must have</i>
<i>heard you wrong.</i>

372
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,383
<i>No!</i>

373
00:25:40,403 --> 00:25:42,894
<i>I told you not to move!</i>

374
00:25:42,972 --> 00:25:44,064
<i>- Aah!</i>
- Aah!

375
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,072
<i>Aah!</i>

376
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,914
Where's the shot?

377
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:54,142
What shot?

378
00:25:54,217 --> 00:25:55,912
You took out the shot.

379
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:57,077
Which shot?

380
00:25:57,153 --> 00:25:59,917
<i>The money shot...</i>
<i>the bus driver's head,</i>

381
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:01,354
the brains-
on-the-window shot,

382
00:26:01,424 --> 00:26:03,221
the viscera-
on-the-visor shot.

383
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,884
We thought we'd show it
to you like this,

384
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:06,019
without all the...

385
00:26:06,095 --> 00:26:08,620
Put it back.
Don't show me anything.

386
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:09,858
You don't need it.

387
00:26:09,932 --> 00:26:11,559
You're not even
giving it a chance.

388
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:14,034
How does the rear-view
mirror gag work without it?

389
00:26:16,205 --> 00:26:20,369
Am I the only one here
who respects the writing?

390
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:27,382
I got to help these kids
on the bus.

391
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,882
Right. Counselor
in training.

392
00:26:28,951 --> 00:26:30,885
When I get back from camp,

393
00:26:30,953 --> 00:26:34,389
I'll practice driving
every time we get in the car.

394
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:37,391
That gives me a month
to relax.

395
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:39,393
Have a great time, pal.

396
00:26:39,461 --> 00:26:40,723
You, too.

397
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:44,227
I'll write a lot.

398
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,392
Yeah.

399
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,435
All right, you have
15 seconds to tell me

400
00:26:47,503 --> 00:26:50,131
all the mother stuff
one more time.

401
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:51,638
Sunscreen, hat,
allergy pills,

402
00:26:51,707 --> 00:26:53,140
summer reading,
floss.

403
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,405
Watch out for
poison oak, lyme ticks,

404
00:26:56,478 --> 00:26:58,412
bears, dragons...

405
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,913
pestilence.

406
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:01,347
Just be careful,
O.K.?

407
00:27:01,417 --> 00:27:04,443
Write if you
need anything.

408
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,011
Mom, I'm going to camp,
not the army.

409
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,281
I love you, sweetheart.

410
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:11,348
Me, too.

411
00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:14,589
Be happy.

412
00:27:27,943 --> 00:27:29,205
I got to go.

413
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:30,210
You O.K.?

414
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:31,211
Mm-hmm.

415
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,713
O.K. Call you later.

416
00:27:32,781 --> 00:27:33,805
O.K.

417
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:42,787
I don't want
to go!

418
00:27:42,858 --> 00:27:44,519
Come on, son.

419
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:47,721
Come on, son. You're
going to have fun. Really.

420
00:27:47,796 --> 00:27:49,661
That's your
good luck hat.

421
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:01,465
Bye-bye!

422
00:28:23,866 --> 00:28:26,858
O.K., Robby, you ready
for an adventure?

423
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:28,061
Mm-hmm.

424
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:31,368
We're going to figure
this town out, you and me.

425
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,203
Here we go.

426
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,708
You ride shotgun.

427
00:28:34,777 --> 00:28:35,709
O.K., Mommy.

428
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:36,710
O.K.?

429
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:37,711
O.K.

430
00:29:03,572 --> 00:29:04,834
Hey.

431
00:29:04,907 --> 00:29:07,341
Fuck, you scared
the shit out of me.

432
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:08,433
The Rolex.

433
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,001
The car? You want it?
You got it.

434
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:17,042
Asshole. I told you
I wanted the watch.

435
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,975
The bleeding's
under control.

436
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:42,976
Just barely.

437
00:29:43,045 --> 00:29:44,410
This guy's lucky.

438
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,415
What do we got here?

439
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,417
A gunshot wound
to the thigh.

440
00:29:49,485 --> 00:29:50,918
Bone, muscle,
and arterial damage.

441
00:29:50,986 --> 00:29:52,419
Is he conscious?

442
00:29:52,488 --> 00:29:53,921
In and out.

443
00:29:53,989 --> 00:29:57,117
Oh, looks like he's
coming out right now.

444
00:29:57,192 --> 00:29:58,625
Severed the sartorious
muscle,

445
00:29:58,694 --> 00:30:00,127
the anterior gracilis,

446
00:30:00,195 --> 00:30:02,629
and partial trauma
to the rectus.

447
00:30:02,698 --> 00:30:03,858
Femoral artery?

448
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:04,864
Jesus, what a mess.

449
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:06,867
Did the femur
just shatter?

450
00:30:06,935 --> 00:30:09,870
See if it's even possible
to save the leg here,

451
00:31:26,982 --> 00:31:28,916
O.K., O.K.

452
00:31:28,984 --> 00:31:29,951
O.K.

453
00:31:34,489 --> 00:31:37,458
O.K. Shh. Shh.

454
00:31:50,939 --> 00:31:52,201
Yeah.

455
00:31:52,274 --> 00:31:56,506
Yes. You got
a soapy head. You do.

456
00:31:56,578 --> 00:31:58,307
Yeah.

457
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:00,746
What's that?

458
00:32:00,816 --> 00:32:03,717
Yes, I know.

459
00:32:03,785 --> 00:32:05,275
I know. O.K.

460
00:32:07,689 --> 00:32:09,122
Here we go.

461
00:32:09,191 --> 00:32:12,126
Right here where you can
see everything.

462
00:32:12,194 --> 00:32:14,424
Mmm.

463
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:17,329
Yum, yum, yum, yum.

464
00:32:35,283 --> 00:32:36,716
Where's that toe?

465
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:39,219
Here it is.
Look at this.

466
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:42,222
Oh, this is going
to look very good on you,

467
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,723
I can tell.

468
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:45,521
I know. Come here.

469
00:32:45,594 --> 00:32:47,687
Go oopsie daisy, do.

470
00:32:47,763 --> 00:32:49,230
O.K.

471
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:56,736
Who's up?

472
00:32:56,805 --> 00:32:59,899
Mrs. Flores
and her three sons.

473
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:02,466
Mmm. Then what?

474
00:33:02,544 --> 00:33:06,310
At 4:30, Mr. Duk.

475
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:07,848
Mr. Duck?

476
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:09,713
Mr. Duk.

477
00:33:09,785 --> 00:33:12,151
Mr. Daffy Duk?

478
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:14,313
You're awful.

479
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:17,256
That's why
I can't stand you.

480
00:33:52,259 --> 00:33:53,191
Hello.

481
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,192
Honey?

482
00:33:54,261 --> 00:33:55,193
Hi, Mack.

483
00:33:55,262 --> 00:33:56,695
How you doing?

484
00:33:56,763 --> 00:33:58,697
Good. I'm having
a good day.

485
00:33:58,765 --> 00:34:00,198
Why are you whispering?

486
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:02,633
Am I whispering? I guess
I'm feeling quiet.

487
00:34:02,703 --> 00:34:04,136
I've been sitting
out back.

488
00:34:04,204 --> 00:34:05,637
I talked to Davis.

489
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:06,900
How is he doing?

490
00:34:06,974 --> 00:34:08,271
Terrible.

491
00:34:08,342 --> 00:34:10,742
Apparently, the bullet just tore
the shit out of everything.

492
00:34:10,811 --> 00:34:13,245
It's going to take
a long time to recover,

493
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:16,339
and then he may have a limp,
but they're not sure.

494
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,348
That's awful.

495
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,850
I can barely hear you.

496
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,352
I said that's awful.

497
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,854
Yeah. Do you still
want to go out tonight?

498
00:34:22,923 --> 00:34:25,357
No, I can't. Uh,
I don't feel like it.

499
00:34:25,425 --> 00:34:27,052
I'll make
something here.

500
00:34:27,127 --> 00:34:30,062
I like the sound of that.
I got to go.

501
00:34:30,130 --> 00:34:31,563
Mack, don't work late.

502
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:33,429
I won't. Bye, baby.

503
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,002
Surprise, surprise.

504
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,007
Yes.

505
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:49,446
Yes.

506
00:34:51,618 --> 00:34:52,812
What?

507
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:53,978
O.K.

508
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:57,218
I love you,
sweetheart.

509
00:34:57,424 --> 00:34:59,551
Oh, shit.

510
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:58,283
Um, how's my girl
doing today?

511
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:05,858
Why...

512
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,459
aren't you...

513
00:36:08,528 --> 00:36:10,120
out...

514
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:13,428
on a date, beauty?

515
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:35,187
What's with school?

516
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:19,997
So?

517
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:21,261
Hmm?

518
00:37:21,334 --> 00:37:23,768
Come on, don't give me
a hard time.

519
00:37:23,837 --> 00:37:26,271
Dee, nobody knows less
about men than me.

520
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:27,772
You do all right.

521
00:37:31,211 --> 00:37:33,645
O.K., let me ask you
one question first.

522
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:35,146
Do you like your job?

523
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:36,477
I know what you're
going to say.

524
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:38,040
Because you can
kiss it goodbye.

525
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,608
It never fails.

526
00:37:39,686 --> 00:37:41,620
I absolutely guarantee
the thing ends

527
00:37:41,688 --> 00:37:43,121
with you
losing your job.

528
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:45,124
And not because
you're the missus now

529
00:37:45,192 --> 00:37:46,181
living in
the big house.

530
00:37:46,259 --> 00:37:47,624
Don't think that's
gonna happen.

531
00:37:47,694 --> 00:37:49,628
I don't think that.
I wouldn't even want that.

532
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:51,129
Give me a little credit,
will you?

533
00:37:51,198 --> 00:37:53,632
One of the things I think
is so great about him

534
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:56,635
is how devoted he is
to his wife and kid.

535
00:37:56,703 --> 00:37:58,136
You're
so full of shit.

536
00:37:58,205 --> 00:38:00,935
You may not even know,
but you really are.

537
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:03,441
You're saying what they
all say at first.

538
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:05,944
I've seen it
many times, honey.

539
00:38:06,012 --> 00:38:08,503
If he is so devoted
to his wife,

540
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:11,517
what's he doing
messing around with you?

541
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:13,018
He hasn't done anything.

542
00:38:13,086 --> 00:38:15,520
You told me you were
holding hands

543
00:38:15,589 --> 00:38:17,022
and getting
all soulful today.

544
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,150
Big deal. I shouldn't
even have told you.

545
00:38:20,227 --> 00:38:21,660
You got
to tell somebody.

546
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,162
That's how you know
it's really happening.

547
00:38:24,231 --> 00:38:26,665
Otherwise, it's
too god damn lonely.

548
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:29,167
We must be going about
this whole thing

549
00:38:29,236 --> 00:38:30,669
wrong or something.

550
00:38:30,737 --> 00:38:32,034
What thing?

551
00:38:32,105 --> 00:38:33,538
The love thing.

552
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:35,598
The touch thing.

553
00:38:35,675 --> 00:38:38,109
Where there's somebody
to touch you,

554
00:38:38,178 --> 00:38:41,375
real nice and gentle.

555
00:38:41,448 --> 00:38:43,882
Doesn't have to be
that gentle.

556
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,713
Whatever.

557
00:38:47,287 --> 00:38:51,223
Jane, do you ever feel
like you're just this far

558
00:38:51,291 --> 00:38:55,853
from being completely
hysterical 24 hours a day?

559
00:38:55,929 --> 00:38:58,762
Half the people I know
feel that way.

560
00:38:58,832 --> 00:39:01,198
The lucky ones feel
that way.

561
00:39:01,268 --> 00:39:04,203
The rest of the people
<i>are</i> hysterical

562
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:05,704
24 hours a day.

563
00:39:21,354 --> 00:39:22,787
Claire, I'm here.

564
00:39:22,856 --> 00:39:24,153
Hi, Mack.

565
00:39:25,425 --> 00:39:28,360
You forgot to bring in
the mail.

566
00:39:28,428 --> 00:39:29,861
Something here
from Carol.

567
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,864
Mack, come on up here.

568
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:34,366
I want to show you
something.

569
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:45,475
Mmm.

570
00:39:47,948 --> 00:39:49,381
Is something wrong?

571
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:50,381
Mm-mmm.

572
00:40:15,475 --> 00:40:16,908
Whose is it?

573
00:40:16,977 --> 00:40:19,207
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

574
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,837
Oh.

575
00:40:20,914 --> 00:40:22,973
Is that the Wilson kid?

576
00:40:25,552 --> 00:40:26,484
Who?

577
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:27,986
I don't know.

578
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:29,487
What do you mean?

579
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:31,990
I don't know
who the parents are.

580
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:34,993
Don't make me guess.
Where did it come from?

581
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:37,529
Shh. Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

582
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:53,771
So?

583
00:40:53,847 --> 00:40:55,781
What's the story?

584
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:57,282
I found her.

585
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,784
I was jogging, and
I heard this crying,

586
00:40:59,853 --> 00:41:01,718
and I looked under
these bushes...

587
00:41:01,788 --> 00:41:03,221
Where was this?

588
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,723
On Carmelina,
around the corner.

589
00:41:04,791 --> 00:41:06,224
I looked
under the bushes,

590
00:41:06,293 --> 00:41:07,817
and there she was.

591
00:41:07,894 --> 00:41:09,327
When was this?

592
00:41:09,396 --> 00:41:10,328
This morning.

593
00:41:10,397 --> 00:41:11,310
This morning? What time?

594
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,223
This morning? What time?

595
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:14,460
Around 9:30, I guess.

596
00:41:14,534 --> 00:41:16,968
What did the police say?

597
00:41:17,036 --> 00:41:18,469
Hmm?

598
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,976
My guess is the police
did not say, "Hmm?"

599
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:26,978
So I guess
my next guess is

600
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:28,980
you haven't called
the police.

601
00:41:30,316 --> 00:41:31,647
Claire.

602
00:41:31,718 --> 00:41:34,152
You know, it's possible
this baby was kidnapped,

603
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,654
and somebody's been frantically
looking for it all day.

604
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:38,156
I don't think so.
I could tell.

605
00:41:38,224 --> 00:41:40,658
But I listened
to the news three times.

606
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,194
There wasn't
a thing about it.

607
00:41:42,262 --> 00:41:43,194
That doesn't
mean a thing.

608
00:41:43,263 --> 00:41:44,457
They may not have
announced it yet,

609
00:41:44,531 --> 00:41:45,725
or maybe they're
waiting to hear

610
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:47,026
from the kidnappers.

611
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,500
This baby wasn't kidnapped.
I can tell you that, Mack.

612
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:52,003
This baby was deserted
by its mother,

613
00:41:52,071 --> 00:41:55,507
and it's going
to need a new one.

614
00:41:56,976 --> 00:41:57,908
Claire,

615
00:41:59,546 --> 00:42:01,013
are you O.K.?

616
00:42:01,047 --> 00:42:02,378
I'm fine.

617
00:42:02,448 --> 00:42:04,382
You do know
that we're going

618
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,884
to have to call
the police right now?

619
00:42:06,953 --> 00:42:07,942
Of course, Mack.

620
00:42:08,021 --> 00:42:10,888
I haven't taken leave
of my senses.

621
00:42:10,957 --> 00:42:12,891
I just wanted you
to see her,

622
00:42:12,959 --> 00:42:15,393
so I waited till you
got home, that's all.

623
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:16,826
She's so beautiful.

624
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:19,387
Just wanted
<i>you</i> to see her.

625
00:43:05,912 --> 00:43:09,712
I told you that baby
wasn't kidnapped.

626
00:43:13,253 --> 00:43:14,652
I told him. I said,

627
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:17,155
"There's no way this vehicle
is worth as much

628
00:43:17,223 --> 00:43:19,657
as you're going to pay
to tow it."

629
00:43:19,726 --> 00:43:22,923
He tells me, "It got
sentimental value."

630
00:43:22,996 --> 00:43:24,429
What's so funny
about that?

631
00:43:24,497 --> 00:43:25,930
Maybe it did.

632
00:43:25,999 --> 00:43:28,593
Yeah, maybe he got
his first piece in there.

633
00:43:28,668 --> 00:43:30,602
Otis,
watch your mouth.

634
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,103
What did he say, Mama?

635
00:43:32,171 --> 00:43:33,103
Nothing, baby.

636
00:43:33,172 --> 00:43:34,799
Just bring me
that meat loaf.

637
00:43:34,874 --> 00:43:38,332
He was in this car
the first time he was shot.

638
00:43:38,411 --> 00:43:42,347
Man! He had
some good times in there.

639
00:43:44,384 --> 00:43:47,581
Are we going to play
roundy roundy, Uncle Simon?

640
00:43:47,654 --> 00:43:48,586
Uh-uh.

641
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:50,748
Time for bed,
little girl.

642
00:43:50,823 --> 00:43:52,256
One game.
Come on, Mama.

643
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:55,260
You said we could play
one game.

644
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:57,660
One game, Mama, please.

645
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:00,130
In your pajamas,
teeth brushed.

646
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:01,063
Go on.

647
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,769
Get ready
to get whipped, Homes.

648
00:44:04,837 --> 00:44:07,135
Ooh.

649
00:44:08,708 --> 00:44:10,642
I know. I started it.

650
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:14,312
Oh, baby, don't you
want to stay home

651
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:15,813
and be with your uncle?

652
00:44:15,882 --> 00:44:19,318
I got to go out.
I got to meet some people.

653
00:44:19,385 --> 00:44:20,943
Take it slow, Simon.

654
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,954
From the shoulders,
old man,

655
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:24,455
you still got it.

656
00:44:24,524 --> 00:44:26,651
I ain't over yet, baby.

657
00:44:26,726 --> 00:44:28,159
Be back soon, Ma.

658
00:44:28,227 --> 00:44:29,455
O.K.

659
00:44:44,977 --> 00:44:46,342
Rarr!

660
00:44:48,414 --> 00:44:51,349
Hey, anybody come from
the shoulders anymore, huh?

661
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:53,817
Anybody
got the hands, huh?

662
00:44:55,955 --> 00:44:57,388
Man, I wish.

663
00:44:57,457 --> 00:44:59,891
Seem like every time
you turn around,

664
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:02,325
some sucker's coming
from the pocket...

665
00:45:02,395 --> 00:45:03,828
and he's strapped.

666
00:45:06,899 --> 00:45:11,336
You know, I never laid
any shit on you, did I?

667
00:45:11,404 --> 00:45:12,928
No.

668
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:16,441
I love you, Otis,
and I love my sister.

669
00:45:16,509 --> 00:45:19,945
I don't want her
to have any more pain

670
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,445
than she's already had.

671
00:45:21,514 --> 00:45:22,947
You know,
she's suffering here

672
00:45:23,015 --> 00:45:24,448
every night till
you come home.

673
00:45:24,517 --> 00:45:26,951
We don't even get
into that no more.

674
00:45:27,019 --> 00:45:28,452
When we're together,

675
00:45:28,521 --> 00:45:29,954
we try and have it
be good.

676
00:45:30,022 --> 00:45:31,956
If we ain't
talking about it,

677
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:34,458
why you got
to talk about it?

678
00:45:34,527 --> 00:45:36,461
It ain't gonna
change nothing.

679
00:45:36,529 --> 00:45:37,587
You sure?

680
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:41,326
Maybe we can figure out
something together.

681
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:42,390
What? What?

682
00:45:42,468 --> 00:45:44,402
You going to figure out
something

683
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:47,405
that nobody else
around here thought of?

684
00:45:55,882 --> 00:45:56,940
Later, Simon.

685
00:45:57,016 --> 00:45:58,074
Hey.

686
00:45:58,151 --> 00:46:00,984
Hey. Plenty have
gotten out, Otis.

687
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,715
I don't want out.

688
00:46:02,789 --> 00:46:04,188
Hey, bullshit.

689
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:06,191
Without my set,
I'm nothing.

690
00:46:06,259 --> 00:46:08,250
They care
about me, man.

691
00:46:08,327 --> 00:46:11,160
You want to be gang-banging
when you're 25?

692
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,288
Shit.

693
00:46:12,365 --> 00:46:15,198
I'll never live
to be 25.

694
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:17,994
I got to roll.

695
00:46:32,285 --> 00:46:33,217
Mmm.

696
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:34,947
I'll call you Friday.

697
00:46:36,122 --> 00:46:37,054
Drive safely.

698
00:46:37,123 --> 00:46:38,112
All right.

699
00:47:38,150 --> 00:47:40,175
Kelley!

700
00:47:42,755 --> 00:47:44,052
Kelley!

701
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:49,527
Kelley! Kelley!
Get down here with me!

702
00:47:49,595 --> 00:47:50,721
Mama!

703
00:47:50,796 --> 00:47:52,787
Mama!

704
00:50:44,269 --> 00:50:46,464
Well, look who's
up and at 'em.

705
00:50:46,538 --> 00:50:47,698
Somebody leave
your curtains

706
00:50:47,773 --> 00:50:49,206
open last night?

707
00:50:49,274 --> 00:50:50,707
I asked them to.

708
00:50:50,776 --> 00:50:53,404
I wanted to see this.

709
00:50:53,478 --> 00:50:55,776
City of the Angels.

710
00:50:55,847 --> 00:50:58,611
I have seen the light.

711
00:51:00,052 --> 00:51:02,213
Mazel tov.

712
00:51:02,287 --> 00:51:03,754
Watch your end.

713
00:51:03,822 --> 00:51:05,517
O.K. Right there.

714
00:51:05,590 --> 00:51:06,784
Close.

715
00:51:09,461 --> 00:51:10,428
Right there.

716
00:51:10,495 --> 00:51:12,554
Move it up.

717
00:52:34,412 --> 00:52:35,845
Be right back.

718
00:52:42,754 --> 00:52:43,686
Hi, Jackson.

719
00:52:46,224 --> 00:52:48,158
Let me see that elbow.

720
00:52:48,226 --> 00:52:50,319
Come on, just one look.

721
00:52:50,395 --> 00:52:55,025
I want to see if it's
as good as my knee.

722
00:52:58,203 --> 00:52:59,261
Ah.

723
00:52:59,337 --> 00:53:01,202
This is just
a scrape, man.

724
00:53:01,273 --> 00:53:03,707
Shit, my knee
was a real mess.

725
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:06,209
This thing
is just half bad.

726
00:53:06,278 --> 00:53:08,473
Did Adam push you?

727
00:53:08,547 --> 00:53:10,481
Should we talk to him?

728
00:53:11,650 --> 00:53:12,582
How come?

729
00:53:12,651 --> 00:53:15,017
He's an asshole.

730
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:20,120
Maybe, but we could
discuss it.

731
00:53:22,961 --> 00:53:24,929
You having a bad day?

732
00:53:27,699 --> 00:53:31,135
Did you get a letter
from your mom today?

733
00:53:33,238 --> 00:53:35,672
Did she say
she missed you?

734
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:39,676
Oh, man, my mom
used to do that.

735
00:53:39,744 --> 00:53:41,177
It made me nuts.

736
00:53:41,246 --> 00:53:42,679
They love you so much,

737
00:53:42,747 --> 00:53:44,180
they don't even know

738
00:53:44,249 --> 00:53:46,183
it's going to make you
feel terrible.

739
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:48,185
I missed my mom so much

740
00:53:48,253 --> 00:53:50,187
the first year
I came here.

741
00:53:50,255 --> 00:53:52,883
When she wrote me
and said she missed me,

742
00:53:52,958 --> 00:53:55,119
I felt so lonely.

743
00:53:57,529 --> 00:53:59,463
Is that how you feel?

744
00:54:02,934 --> 00:54:05,164
Well, you got me.

745
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,236
"Just don't tell him."

746
00:54:13,311 --> 00:54:14,573
So Harlan told him
anyway.

747
00:54:14,646 --> 00:54:16,238
What else
would Harlan do?

748
00:54:16,314 --> 00:54:18,748
The only way he
wouldn't have told him

749
00:54:18,817 --> 00:54:21,251
is if I'd told him
to tell him.

750
00:54:21,319 --> 00:54:23,753
I can't talk about Harlan
again tonight.

751
00:54:23,822 --> 00:54:26,256
I've begged you to get away
from him for eight years.

752
00:54:26,324 --> 00:54:27,757
What, so I can start

753
00:54:27,826 --> 00:54:29,259
a new immigration
practice on my own?

754
00:54:29,327 --> 00:54:30,760
That night
when I thought

755
00:54:30,829 --> 00:54:32,763
those boys were
going to kill me,

756
00:54:32,831 --> 00:54:34,093
I realized...

757
00:54:34,165 --> 00:54:36,759
I hate fucking
immigration law.

758
00:54:36,835 --> 00:54:38,268
No, you don't.

759
00:54:38,336 --> 00:54:40,770
You like it,
and you're good at it.

760
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:43,774
You hate being partners
with an asshole like Harlan.

761
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:46,777
Maybe you hate some
other part of your life,

762
00:54:46,845 --> 00:54:49,279
and you don't
want to admit it.

763
00:54:49,347 --> 00:54:50,780
What did you say?

764
00:54:50,849 --> 00:54:53,283
When a person thinks
they're about to die,

765
00:54:53,351 --> 00:54:55,785
nothing they did that day
will look worthwhile.

766
00:54:55,854 --> 00:54:58,288
That's not what
you were going to say.

767
00:54:58,356 --> 00:55:00,790
If you know what
I'm going to say,

768
00:55:00,859 --> 00:55:02,793
I guess I don't have
to say anything.

769
00:55:02,861 --> 00:55:04,726
Look, I don't even know
what I'm going to say

770
00:55:04,796 --> 00:55:07,492
from one second
to the next.

771
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:10,432
The world doesn't make
any sense to me anymore.

772
00:55:10,502 --> 00:55:11,867
What's going on?

773
00:55:11,936 --> 00:55:15,702
There are babies lying
around in the streets.

774
00:55:15,774 --> 00:55:18,334
There are people
living in boxes.

775
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,775
There are people
ready to shoot you

776
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:21,106
if you look at them.

777
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:23,545
And we're
getting used to it.

778
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:25,549
The world is so nuts,

779
00:55:25,617 --> 00:55:27,881
it makes me
wonder about

780
00:55:27,952 --> 00:55:29,385
all the choices
that we've made.

781
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,785
Jesus Christ.

782
00:55:30,855 --> 00:55:32,220
What?

783
00:55:33,291 --> 00:55:34,383
Oh, shit.

784
00:55:34,459 --> 00:55:36,222
Oh.

785
00:55:37,796 --> 00:55:39,889
Let's see what you...
Wow.

786
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:40,896
Ah...

787
00:55:40,965 --> 00:55:42,626
Damn, that smarts.

788
00:55:44,469 --> 00:55:46,266
Hold it up.
Apply pressure.

789
00:55:46,337 --> 00:55:47,395
Pressure. Pressure.

790
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:48,905
I'm taking you
to the hospital.

791
00:55:48,973 --> 00:55:50,270
They'll have
to sew that up.

792
00:55:50,341 --> 00:55:52,275
No. It's not that bad.

793
00:55:52,343 --> 00:55:53,776
Here, let's see.

794
00:55:53,845 --> 00:55:55,904
Take it off.

795
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,413
Look at this.

796
00:55:57,482 --> 00:55:59,109
Under the water.

797
00:55:59,184 --> 00:56:01,243
See what happens
when you yell at me?

798
00:56:01,319 --> 00:56:03,150
Never again, baby.

799
00:56:03,221 --> 00:56:05,416
Maybe next time you'll
be more understanding

800
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,481
when I bitch
about my life.

801
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:08,651
Here. O.K.

802
00:56:08,726 --> 00:56:10,250
Ow, ow! Let me.

803
00:56:10,328 --> 00:56:11,761
I'll get my purse.

804
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,856
I'm going to take you
to St. John's.

805
00:56:14,933 --> 00:56:16,867
Maybe you
better sit down.

806
00:56:16,935 --> 00:56:19,870
I really don't need
to get this sewn up.

807
00:56:19,938 --> 00:56:22,031
Are you afraid
of a few stitches?

808
00:56:22,107 --> 00:56:23,540
I'm not afraid.

809
00:56:23,608 --> 00:56:25,872
I just think we ought
to discuss this.

810
00:56:25,944 --> 00:56:27,377
You're kidding, right?

811
00:56:29,781 --> 00:56:31,612
Are you going
into shock?

812
00:56:31,683 --> 00:56:34,880
I just hate seeing my blood
spill out on me like that.

813
00:56:34,953 --> 00:56:36,318
Does everybody...

814
00:56:39,624 --> 00:56:41,148
Earthquake!
Earthquake!

815
00:56:41,226 --> 00:56:42,659
It's a big one.

816
00:56:42,727 --> 00:56:44,160
Let's get
outta here.

817
00:56:44,229 --> 00:56:45,662
Aren't we supposed to...

818
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,062
Aren't we supposed to...

819
00:56:48,133 --> 00:56:49,725
I don't care!

820
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:52,061
I'm sorry.

821
00:56:52,137 --> 00:56:53,570
I'm never
complaining again.

822
00:56:53,638 --> 00:56:54,730
Bullshit.

823
00:56:54,806 --> 00:56:56,239
No, no. I swear.

824
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:58,741
You'll forget about
all this tomorrow.

825
00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:00,243
No, no, no.

826
00:57:00,311 --> 00:57:01,744
Did you feel that?

827
00:57:01,813 --> 00:57:04,247
I think there's
an aftershock coming.

828
00:57:04,315 --> 00:57:06,647
Sally. Your chandelier
fall down again?

829
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:08,481
- No.
- Oh, good.

830
00:57:08,553 --> 00:57:09,645
Claire!

831
00:57:09,721 --> 00:57:10,813
Claire!

832
00:57:10,889 --> 00:57:12,254
Bernice,
what's the matter?

833
00:57:12,323 --> 00:57:13,415
Claire!

834
00:57:13,491 --> 00:57:14,583
It's Byron.

835
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:17,219
I don't know what's
wrong with him.

836
00:57:17,295 --> 00:57:19,525
I dialed 911.
The line's busy.

837
00:57:19,597 --> 00:57:21,360
I don't know
what's happening.

838
00:57:21,432 --> 00:57:23,366
Everything's
going to be O.K.

839
00:57:23,434 --> 00:57:24,867
We'll be right there.

840
00:57:31,509 --> 00:57:32,703
He's bleeding!

841
00:57:32,777 --> 00:57:34,711
No, he's not.
That's Mack.

842
00:57:42,287 --> 00:57:44,380
Come on, come on.

843
00:57:44,455 --> 00:57:46,047
Come on.

844
00:57:46,124 --> 00:57:48,558
I need an ambulance
right away.

845
00:57:48,626 --> 00:57:50,253
222 Avondale.

846
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:51,488
What?

847
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:54,056
Yes.

848
00:57:54,132 --> 00:57:55,599
Yes.

849
00:57:55,667 --> 00:57:57,760
Uh, male.

850
00:57:57,835 --> 00:58:00,303
79, I think.

851
00:58:01,973 --> 00:58:03,065
Heart attack.

852
00:58:03,141 --> 00:58:04,233
Maybe a... Maybe a...

853
00:59:42,573 --> 00:59:44,641
Aah!

854
00:59:44,676 --> 00:59:46,709
Aah!

855
00:59:46,777 --> 00:59:50,543
Aah!

856
01:00:12,236 --> 01:00:13,430
Hey, man!

857
01:00:15,406 --> 01:00:16,498
Hey, Mack!

858
01:00:16,574 --> 01:00:18,337
Over here!

859
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:20,434
Come on!

860
01:00:20,511 --> 01:00:22,240
Give me a fly-by!

861
01:00:25,249 --> 01:00:28,776
Yeah! Ha ha ha...

862
01:01:52,603 --> 01:01:55,197
Mom, I think
you need to get organized.

863
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:32,401
Nobody told me that!

864
01:02:32,476 --> 01:02:33,841
I sense it!

865
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:37,892
Mack.

866
01:04:37,968 --> 01:04:39,401
Mack, wake up.

867
01:04:44,242 --> 01:04:46,233
So, now
tell me that again.

868
01:04:46,311 --> 01:04:48,745
You have the baby
at home now?

869
01:04:48,813 --> 01:04:50,246
Oh, Mack,
that's wonderful.

870
01:04:50,315 --> 01:04:52,249
That's not
what I said.

871
01:04:52,317 --> 01:04:54,581
Claire wants
to adopt the baby.

872
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:56,085
Claire is so great.

873
01:04:56,154 --> 01:04:57,587
What's the problem?

874
01:04:57,655 --> 01:05:00,590
You're not allowed to just
keep every baby you find.

875
01:05:00,658 --> 01:05:02,421
Aren't there laws and shit
about that kinda thing?

876
01:05:02,494 --> 01:05:04,928
There's a process
you can go through.

877
01:05:04,996 --> 01:05:05,963
Claire's already
started

878
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:07,190
collecting
the forms.

879
01:05:07,265 --> 01:05:09,699
She is the most
self-actualized person

880
01:05:09,767 --> 01:05:10,927
I ever met.

881
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:12,367
She is this week.

882
01:05:12,437 --> 01:05:14,268
Home, sweet home.

883
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:15,397
Mr. Davis.

884
01:05:15,473 --> 01:05:17,373
Hiya, Leonard.
Good to see you.

885
01:05:17,442 --> 01:05:18,875
Just toss me in.

886
01:05:18,943 --> 01:05:21,673
Just roll me back
and flip me in.

887
01:05:21,746 --> 01:05:23,680
I'll go check the car.

888
01:05:23,748 --> 01:05:25,181
Set the brake.

889
01:05:25,250 --> 01:05:26,683
What could happen?

890
01:05:26,751 --> 01:05:28,378
Is that going to work?

891
01:05:28,453 --> 01:05:30,387
I'll see you back
at the house.

892
01:05:30,455 --> 01:05:32,184
You got it.

893
01:05:32,257 --> 01:05:34,885
Mabel, I'll never forget
the times we had.

894
01:05:34,959 --> 01:05:37,928
As you know perfectly well,
my name is Esther.

895
01:05:37,996 --> 01:05:39,293
My mother's name
was Esther.

896
01:05:39,364 --> 01:05:40,763
And since you've been
so much kinder to me

897
01:05:40,832 --> 01:05:41,764
than my mother ever was,

898
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:43,892
I have given you
a better name.

899
01:05:43,968 --> 01:05:45,401
And when I think
of the experience

900
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:46,903
that changed my life,

901
01:05:46,971 --> 01:05:49,405
I will think
appreciatively of you.

902
01:05:49,474 --> 01:05:51,908
You are very kind.

903
01:05:51,976 --> 01:05:54,501
Remember, if you start
to feel some pressure,

904
01:05:54,579 --> 01:05:57,412
that means it's time
to get the pus drained.

905
01:05:57,482 --> 01:06:00,076
I love it when you
talk that way.

906
01:06:00,151 --> 01:06:02,415
Don't you have
a favorite charity?

907
01:06:02,487 --> 01:06:04,751
A favorite child?
A favorite horse?

908
01:06:04,822 --> 01:06:07,086
This is
very unusual for me.

909
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:08,921
I'm notoriously cheap.
Ask anyone.

910
01:06:08,993 --> 01:06:10,085
It's true.

911
01:06:10,161 --> 01:06:11,253
Goodbye, Davis.

912
01:06:11,329 --> 01:06:12,694
O.K., a hug.

913
01:06:12,764 --> 01:06:14,197
Come on, a hug.

914
01:06:14,265 --> 01:06:15,698
There we go.

915
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,200
O.K., so long.
Bye.

916
01:06:17,268 --> 01:06:18,701
Take it easy.

917
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:22,772
Leonard,
get me outta here.

918
01:06:32,450 --> 01:06:34,884
So, tell me about
this life change.

919
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,716
It's not a life change.

920
01:06:36,788 --> 01:06:39,052
I had some kind
of vision,

921
01:06:39,123 --> 01:06:40,055
some, uh... insight,

922
01:06:40,124 --> 01:06:42,058
but I don't want
to talk about it.

923
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:44,060
Tell him, Davis.
He's your best friend.

924
01:06:44,128 --> 01:06:45,891
We're talking about
Mack's new baby.

925
01:06:45,964 --> 01:06:47,898
Besides, I think
if you talk about stuff,

926
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:49,399
that takes the place
of doing it.

927
01:06:49,467 --> 01:06:51,128
That's never been
your problem.

928
01:06:51,202 --> 01:06:53,329
No kidding.

929
01:06:53,404 --> 01:06:54,894
Claire wants this baby,

930
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:57,407
but you're not
high on the idea,

931
01:06:57,475 --> 01:06:59,568
not that
you don't like kids.

932
01:06:59,644 --> 01:07:01,407
Roberto's maybe
the best thing

933
01:07:01,479 --> 01:07:03,743
that ever happened
in your life,

934
01:07:03,815 --> 01:07:05,248
but he's 15 now.

935
01:07:05,316 --> 01:07:07,079
Soon he'll be moving out.

936
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:10,086
You thought you and Claire
could get back the freedom

937
01:07:10,154 --> 01:07:12,520
you had when you
were first married.

938
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:15,184
You feel you're
getting old way too fast.

939
01:07:15,260 --> 01:07:18,354
The last thing on your mind
was starting a new family

940
01:07:18,429 --> 01:07:20,863
with all the whining
and the diapers

941
01:07:20,932 --> 01:07:22,866
and the attendant
baby baggage.

942
01:07:22,934 --> 01:07:25,266
Why start all that again
when you already wonder

943
01:07:25,336 --> 01:07:28,362
if you did the right thing
the first time?

944
01:07:28,439 --> 01:07:29,838
Davis, you're awful.

945
01:07:29,907 --> 01:07:32,375
This is so much more
time-efficient

946
01:07:32,443 --> 01:07:34,001
than a regular
conversation.

947
01:07:34,078 --> 01:07:35,511
Since you're
currently obsessed

948
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:36,877
with the question
of what's going down

949
01:07:36,948 --> 01:07:39,542
and why are you
going with it,

950
01:07:39,617 --> 01:07:41,380
what shape are you in

951
01:07:41,452 --> 01:07:44,148
to take on some new baby
from God knows where,

952
01:07:44,222 --> 01:07:47,214
who has God knows what
health and emotional problems

953
01:07:47,292 --> 01:07:49,954
and never asked
to be taken in anyway?

954
01:07:52,130 --> 01:07:54,155
On the other hand...

955
01:08:00,805 --> 01:08:03,171
Hey, baby,
what's the matter?

956
01:08:14,919 --> 01:08:17,353
While we got
a moment here,

957
01:08:17,422 --> 01:08:18,855
explain something to me.

958
01:08:18,923 --> 01:08:21,448
What is the theory
on this handkerchief thing?

959
01:08:21,526 --> 01:08:23,858
You blow your nose in it,

960
01:08:23,928 --> 01:08:26,192
put it back
in your pocket.

961
01:08:26,264 --> 01:08:28,357
Then you see someone
in distress

962
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:30,867
and give them this gift
from your pocket?

963
01:08:30,935 --> 01:08:32,596
They're supposed
to be grateful

964
01:08:32,670 --> 01:08:35,036
as they wipe it
all over their face?

965
01:08:35,106 --> 01:08:38,041
If I tell you,
you'll think it's about you,

966
01:08:38,109 --> 01:08:39,542
but it's not,

967
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:42,340
but you won't believe it,
and you'll get defensive.

968
01:08:42,413 --> 01:08:44,745
If you don't want
to talk about it,

969
01:08:44,816 --> 01:08:45,908
don't force yourself.

970
01:08:45,983 --> 01:08:47,883
I want to have children.

971
01:08:47,952 --> 01:08:49,385
I really want them.

972
01:08:49,454 --> 01:08:51,888
I don't care
how rotten the world is,

973
01:08:51,956 --> 01:08:54,390
but I'm so far
from having them.

974
01:08:54,459 --> 01:08:55,892
I'm involved with you,

975
01:08:55,960 --> 01:08:58,895
and you're not going
to have kids with me.

976
01:08:58,963 --> 01:09:00,555
We're not even
getting married.

977
01:09:00,631 --> 01:09:02,064
I can't even start.

978
01:09:02,133 --> 01:09:04,397
I got to break up with you

979
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:07,404
and find someone else
I can stand being with,

980
01:09:07,472 --> 01:09:10,407
and even then, I might have
trouble getting pregnant

981
01:09:10,475 --> 01:09:12,705
after everything
I've done to my body.

982
01:09:17,415 --> 01:09:19,849
Maybe I should just
hop out up here.

983
01:09:19,917 --> 01:09:20,849
I could call a cab.

984
01:09:20,918 --> 01:09:21,907
Why, Mack?

985
01:09:21,986 --> 01:09:24,682
You're my friend,
too, aren't you?

986
01:09:30,428 --> 01:09:31,520
Hey.

987
01:09:31,596 --> 01:09:32,858
Hey.

988
01:09:32,930 --> 01:09:36,866
Who says we're never going
to get married and have kids?

989
01:09:50,448 --> 01:09:51,881
No, I didn't.

990
01:09:51,949 --> 01:09:53,610
Well, doesn't it?

991
01:10:16,908 --> 01:10:18,375
Uh-uh. Come on, baby.

992
01:10:54,412 --> 01:10:55,879
Hey.

993
01:10:55,947 --> 01:10:57,778
Hey, how you doing?

994
01:10:59,550 --> 01:11:02,485
I don't know
if you remember me.

995
01:11:05,456 --> 01:11:07,390
Oh. Hey, man, sure.

996
01:11:07,458 --> 01:11:08,891
Uh, Mack, right?

997
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:10,052
Right.

998
01:11:10,127 --> 01:11:12,493
Yeah, I didn't
recognize you at first.

999
01:11:12,563 --> 01:11:13,825
Yeah.

1000
01:11:13,898 --> 01:11:14,990
I called,

1001
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:18,866
and they said you'd be
getting in about now.

1002
01:11:18,936 --> 01:11:22,201
I wanted to thank you again
for the other night.

1003
01:11:22,273 --> 01:11:24,366
You did already.

1004
01:11:25,743 --> 01:11:26,835
Look...

1005
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:29,846
can I buy you
breakfast somewhere

1006
01:11:29,914 --> 01:11:31,006
or something?

1007
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:34,343
Yeah. Sure.

1008
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:36,852
Just a minute.
All right?

1009
01:11:43,861 --> 01:11:45,852
You play basketball?

1010
01:11:45,930 --> 01:11:47,693
I played
in high school.

1011
01:11:47,765 --> 01:11:50,199
Sixth man for a year
and a half.

1012
01:11:50,267 --> 01:11:52,701
Me, too. Sixth man
until my senior year.

1013
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:54,032
Then I started.

1014
01:11:54,105 --> 01:11:55,538
Center or forward?

1015
01:11:55,606 --> 01:11:58,200
Forward. I wasn't
big enough for center.

1016
01:11:58,275 --> 01:12:00,140
Must have been
some team.

1017
01:12:00,211 --> 01:12:02,873
We had Oscar Benson
on that team.

1018
01:12:02,947 --> 01:12:03,879
No shit?

1019
01:12:03,948 --> 01:12:05,381
You must be
pretty good.

1020
01:12:05,449 --> 01:12:06,473
I wasn't playing
the same game

1021
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:07,915
that Oscar was playing.

1022
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,324
Uh, look...

1023
01:12:15,392 --> 01:12:16,825
the other night...

1024
01:12:16,894 --> 01:12:18,828
You weren't in any danger

1025
01:12:18,896 --> 01:12:21,330
except for maybe
losing your wallet.

1026
01:12:21,398 --> 01:12:23,161
I didn't save your life,

1027
01:12:23,234 --> 01:12:26,829
so don't think you have
to say something to me.

1028
01:12:26,904 --> 01:12:29,338
One morning
about three years ago,

1029
01:12:29,406 --> 01:12:32,341
I was on my way
to a meeting

1030
01:12:32,409 --> 01:12:35,003
at the Mutual Benefit
building on Wilshire

1031
01:12:35,079 --> 01:12:36,512
in the Miracle Mile.

1032
01:12:36,580 --> 01:12:39,310
I love that name...
Miracle Mile.

1033
01:12:39,383 --> 01:12:41,851
It's the building
across the street

1034
01:12:41,919 --> 01:12:43,853
from the County
Art Museum.

1035
01:12:43,921 --> 01:12:46,355
I was thinking
about the meeting.

1036
01:12:46,423 --> 01:12:48,857
I was worried about it,
actually.

1037
01:12:48,926 --> 01:12:51,861
I started
to step off the curb...

1038
01:12:51,929 --> 01:12:53,863
and a stranger
grabbed me

1039
01:12:53,931 --> 01:12:55,364
and yanked me back

1040
01:12:55,432 --> 01:12:58,765
as a city bus went
flying by my nose.

1041
01:12:58,836 --> 01:13:02,465
It filled up the world
6 inches from my nose.

1042
01:13:02,540 --> 01:13:04,872
I would have been
a wet bug stain.

1043
01:13:04,942 --> 01:13:06,876
I wouldn't have
even felt it.

1044
01:13:06,944 --> 01:13:09,504
It would have been
over so fast.

1045
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:10,877
I thanked this stranger,

1046
01:13:10,948 --> 01:13:13,143
this woman
in a baseball cap,

1047
01:13:13,217 --> 01:13:16,311
but I was pretty much
in a daze.

1048
01:13:16,387 --> 01:13:19,322
When I thanked her,
she said, "My pleasure."

1049
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:21,824
I didn't notice
till the last moment

1050
01:13:21,892 --> 01:13:23,416
the cap she wore was

1051
01:13:23,494 --> 01:13:24,825
from the Pittsburgh
Pirates,

1052
01:13:24,895 --> 01:13:27,329
my favorite team
since I was a kid.

1053
01:13:27,398 --> 01:13:28,695
Roberto Clemente.

1054
01:13:28,766 --> 01:13:29,892
Right.

1055
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:32,333
I never
got over the idea

1056
01:13:32,403 --> 01:13:34,837
that I should have
thanked that woman more,

1057
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:36,338
talked to her,
something.

1058
01:13:36,407 --> 01:13:37,840
She reached out

1059
01:13:37,908 --> 01:13:40,843
and yanked me back
from the edge,

1060
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:42,344
literally changed
everything for me,

1061
01:13:42,413 --> 01:13:44,677
for my wife
and my son.

1062
01:13:44,748 --> 01:13:46,511
Then she just
wandered off

1063
01:13:46,584 --> 01:13:47,915
down the Miracle Mile.

1064
01:13:47,985 --> 01:13:50,852
And how come she was
wearing a Pirates cap?

1065
01:13:50,921 --> 01:13:53,355
That's unusual at 9 A.M.
on Wilshire Boulevard,

1066
01:13:53,424 --> 01:13:55,858
a woman in a Pittsburgh
Pirates baseball cap.

1067
01:13:55,926 --> 01:13:57,018
It's suspicious.

1068
01:13:57,094 --> 01:13:58,527
You lost me.

1069
01:13:58,596 --> 01:14:00,530
I just wondered
later on,

1070
01:14:00,598 --> 01:14:02,361
was she for real?

1071
01:14:02,433 --> 01:14:04,367
Was that
a real person,

1072
01:14:04,435 --> 01:14:06,369
or was that
something else?

1073
01:14:06,437 --> 01:14:09,372
You know, sent
from somewhere else

1074
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:12,375
to grab me back
from that curb.

1075
01:14:12,443 --> 01:14:15,037
Is that what you're
wondering about me?

1076
01:14:15,112 --> 01:14:17,706
I just couldn't
let it happen again.

1077
01:14:17,781 --> 01:14:19,373
I didn't want to just

1078
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:20,883
let you drift away
like she did

1079
01:14:20,951 --> 01:14:22,885
and never talk to you.

1080
01:14:22,953 --> 01:14:25,387
Didn't seem right
to let it happen twice.

1081
01:14:25,456 --> 01:14:27,219
That's why
I'm bothering you.

1082
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:28,724
You're not bothering me.

1083
01:14:28,792 --> 01:14:30,726
You're just
buying me breakfast.

1084
01:14:30,794 --> 01:14:31,886
Good.

1085
01:14:31,962 --> 01:14:33,395
You got a right

1086
01:14:33,464 --> 01:14:36,228
to try to figure out
what confuses you,

1087
01:14:36,300 --> 01:14:39,235
but it seems like you're making
more of this than it is.

1088
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:41,066
The world's a hard place.

1089
01:14:41,138 --> 01:14:43,402
Sometimes
you just get lucky.

1090
01:14:43,474 --> 01:14:44,907
I believe in luck.

1091
01:14:44,975 --> 01:14:46,636
Of course,
sometimes you don't.

1092
01:14:46,710 --> 01:14:48,075
One thing's for sure...

1093
01:14:48,145 --> 01:14:49,510
If you're alive,

1094
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,912
some terrible shit's
gonna happen to you.

1095
01:14:51,982 --> 01:14:53,745
Maybe some
good things, too,

1096
01:14:53,817 --> 01:14:56,251
but you can always
count on the terrible.

1097
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:58,083
If it doesn't kill you,

1098
01:14:58,155 --> 01:15:01,090
you'll be around to see it
come down some other way.

1099
01:15:01,158 --> 01:15:02,591
Thank you, honey.

1100
01:15:02,660 --> 01:15:04,753
No. No, thanks.

1101
01:15:04,828 --> 01:15:09,424
My... father died
last year.

1102
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,933
81 years old.

1103
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:12,366
That's a long time

1104
01:15:12,436 --> 01:15:15,371
for a black man
to live in this town.

1105
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:17,873
He outlived
everyone he ever knew.

1106
01:15:17,942 --> 01:15:19,375
Saw two wives die

1107
01:15:19,443 --> 01:15:21,377
and three of his children.

1108
01:15:21,445 --> 01:15:24,380
He had a great
ugly old face

1109
01:15:24,448 --> 01:15:27,383
that looked like a suitcase
gone a million miles...

1110
01:15:27,451 --> 01:15:30,386
all beat up and dented
and scuffed and stained.

1111
01:15:30,454 --> 01:15:33,389
He looked like he walked
80 years on that face.

1112
01:15:33,457 --> 01:15:36,051
When I used
to look at that face

1113
01:15:36,126 --> 01:15:38,390
and see
all the pain there,

1114
01:15:38,462 --> 01:15:41,397
all the things he lost,
all the hurt he had,

1115
01:15:41,465 --> 01:15:44,059
I wondered why
he wanted to go on,

1116
01:15:44,134 --> 01:15:47,865
why he just didn't
lay down and give it up.

1117
01:15:47,938 --> 01:15:49,929
Did you figure it out?

1118
01:15:50,007 --> 01:15:52,407
No. Never figured out
much about that guy.

1119
01:15:52,476 --> 01:15:54,000
I asked him, though.

1120
01:15:54,078 --> 01:15:55,340
What did he say?

1121
01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:57,607
Habit.

1122
01:16:04,121 --> 01:16:06,555
Does your sister
have a job?

1123
01:16:06,623 --> 01:16:08,557
She's a cashier
at Jon's.

1124
01:16:08,625 --> 01:16:10,559
Lets her work her hours

1125
01:16:10,627 --> 01:16:12,356
around her
little girl's school.

1126
01:16:12,429 --> 01:16:13,862
Would they let her

1127
01:16:13,931 --> 01:16:15,364
transfer
to another store?

1128
01:16:15,432 --> 01:16:17,696
I don't know. Why?

1129
01:16:17,768 --> 01:16:19,861
I was just wondering
about something.

1130
01:16:19,937 --> 01:16:21,336
What's that?

1131
01:16:23,941 --> 01:16:26,375
Just seems like
an impossible situation.

1132
01:16:26,443 --> 01:16:28,877
You can't live
your life like that,

1133
01:16:28,946 --> 01:16:31,346
thinking someone's going
to shoot up your house.

1134
01:16:31,415 --> 01:16:34,043
A lot of people do.

1135
01:16:34,118 --> 01:16:36,552
You know,
I know this guy

1136
01:16:36,620 --> 01:16:39,555
who's got an apartment
house in Canoga Park.

1137
01:16:39,623 --> 01:16:42,558
I might be able to get
her something out there

1138
01:16:42,626 --> 01:16:44,321
at a very
reasonable price.

1139
01:16:44,395 --> 01:16:46,158
Uh...

1140
01:16:46,230 --> 01:16:49,893
Hey, listen, Mack,
thanks, but, uh...

1141
01:16:49,967 --> 01:16:52,902
I'm not so sure
it's a good idea.

1142
01:16:52,970 --> 01:16:55,404
O.K. I'm not going
to push it

1143
01:16:55,472 --> 01:16:56,905
if you're not
comfortable.

1144
01:16:56,974 --> 01:16:59,568
Maybe you want
to think about it.

1145
01:16:59,643 --> 01:17:01,907
You don't have
to decide now.

1146
01:17:01,979 --> 01:17:03,742
Yeah, maybe.

1147
01:17:03,814 --> 01:17:05,441
O.K.

1148
01:17:05,516 --> 01:17:06,915
You got my number.

1149
01:17:06,984 --> 01:17:08,076
Yeah, O.K.

1150
01:17:10,654 --> 01:17:12,519
Simon?

1151
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:13,851
Yeah.

1152
01:17:13,924 --> 01:17:15,983
What is it exactly?

1153
01:17:16,060 --> 01:17:18,119
I want to know
for two reasons...

1154
01:17:18,195 --> 01:17:20,857
to know if it's
what I think it is

1155
01:17:20,931 --> 01:17:24,389
and that I haven't done
something to offend you.

1156
01:17:24,468 --> 01:17:26,868
That's the last thing
I wanted to do.

1157
01:17:26,937 --> 01:17:30,566
Man, you are
a piece of work.

1158
01:17:30,641 --> 01:17:32,370
Sometimes I let stuff go,

1159
01:17:32,443 --> 01:17:34,809
and then I wonder
about it later.

1160
01:17:34,878 --> 01:17:36,243
O.K., here it is.

1161
01:17:36,313 --> 01:17:38,747
I guess
I think it's hard,

1162
01:17:38,816 --> 01:17:40,215
maybe even dangerous,

1163
01:17:40,284 --> 01:17:42,718
mucking around with
other people's lives.

1164
01:17:42,786 --> 01:17:44,219
Sometimes
there's a reason

1165
01:17:44,288 --> 01:17:46,153
they're doing
what they're doing.

1166
01:17:46,223 --> 01:17:47,656
That's a tough one.

1167
01:17:47,724 --> 01:17:50,557
You don't want to fuck
with things you shouldn't.

1168
01:17:50,627 --> 01:17:53,562
But you don't always
want to turn away, either.

1169
01:17:53,630 --> 01:17:56,064
Is that what you
thought it was?

1170
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:58,897
Yeah, that and...

1171
01:17:58,969 --> 01:18:01,233
you know...

1172
01:18:01,305 --> 01:18:03,239
the white guy.

1173
01:18:03,307 --> 01:18:05,241
You white?

1174
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,641
Hey, how about
Canoga Park?

1175
01:18:08,712 --> 01:18:10,680
That's pretty white,
ain't it?

1176
01:18:10,747 --> 01:18:12,510
No, not really.

1177
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,244
Think about it.

1178
01:18:14,318 --> 01:18:15,785
I'll see you.

1179
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:26,595
To try and understand
just what exactly

1180
01:18:26,663 --> 01:18:28,597
had been
delivered unto me

1181
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:31,361
at the cost
of flesh and bone

1182
01:18:31,435 --> 01:18:32,868
and precious blood,

1183
01:18:32,936 --> 01:18:35,530
what message was being
delivered to me

1184
01:18:35,606 --> 01:18:37,540
in a.38-caliber
envelope

1185
01:18:37,608 --> 01:18:40,372
for me to open and read
and understand,

1186
01:18:40,444 --> 01:18:41,877
and this problem,

1187
01:18:41,945 --> 01:18:43,378
this, um, difficulty

1188
01:18:43,447 --> 01:18:45,381
I was having
in understanding,

1189
01:18:45,449 --> 01:18:48,043
it grew on me
like a fever.

1190
01:18:48,118 --> 01:18:50,052
It buzzed
around my brain

1191
01:18:50,120 --> 01:18:52,213
till I could
no longer sleep

1192
01:18:52,289 --> 01:18:54,723
or eat or think
about anything else.

1193
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:56,884
It was as painful
and real

1194
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:59,895
as the physical wound
I saw in my thigh.

1195
01:19:01,064 --> 01:19:02,300
What?

1196
01:19:02,433 --> 01:19:03,400
Nothing.

1197
01:19:03,467 --> 01:19:05,901
Go on. I want
to hear this.

1198
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,905
I had a feeling that you
more than anyone else

1199
01:19:08,973 --> 01:19:11,407
would have a problem
taking me seriously.

1200
01:19:11,475 --> 01:19:13,340
I am taking you
seriously.

1201
01:19:13,411 --> 01:19:15,743
I'm sorry for whatever
you think you saw.

1202
01:19:15,813 --> 01:19:18,475
First you have to tell me
what made you smile.

1203
01:19:18,549 --> 01:19:19,641
"Unto."

1204
01:19:19,717 --> 01:19:20,843
What?

1205
01:19:20,918 --> 01:19:22,317
You said,
"delivered unto" you.

1206
01:19:22,386 --> 01:19:23,410
I'm sorry.

1207
01:19:23,487 --> 01:19:24,852
That is purposeful.

1208
01:19:24,922 --> 01:19:27,356
We're talking about
a religious experience.

1209
01:19:27,425 --> 01:19:30,758
I might say doth or thou
or lots of things.

1210
01:19:30,828 --> 01:19:32,261
Please, Davis,
go on.

1211
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,855
The suspense
is killing me.

1212
01:19:34,932 --> 01:19:38,333
The end of this long,
torturous night,

1213
01:19:38,402 --> 01:19:40,336
my head pounding
in syncopation

1214
01:19:40,404 --> 01:19:42,872
to my throbbing wound,

1215
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:46,376
there came a glorious,
delicate dawn,

1216
01:19:46,444 --> 01:19:48,207
and I knew,

1217
01:19:48,279 --> 01:19:50,873
I knew I can't make
those movies anymore.

1218
01:19:50,948 --> 01:19:53,382
I can't make
another piece of art

1219
01:19:53,451 --> 01:19:54,884
that glorifies violence

1220
01:19:54,952 --> 01:19:57,614
and bloodshed
and brutality.

1221
01:19:57,688 --> 01:20:01,385
I can't contribute
another stone

1222
01:20:01,459 --> 01:20:04,394
to this landslide
of dehumanizing rage

1223
01:20:04,462 --> 01:20:06,896
that has swept
across this country

1224
01:20:06,964 --> 01:20:08,488
like a pestilence.

1225
01:20:08,566 --> 01:20:10,898
That's a mixed metaphor,
isn't it?

1226
01:20:10,968 --> 01:20:14,335
Anyway, I'm done,
kaput, finis...

1227
01:20:14,405 --> 01:20:17,841
No more exploding bodies,
exploding buildings,

1228
01:20:17,908 --> 01:20:19,239
exploding anything.

1229
01:20:22,913 --> 01:20:25,040
No more shit.

1230
01:20:25,116 --> 01:20:26,845
Davis,
that's wonderful.

1231
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:29,351
You know how
I feel about it.

1232
01:20:29,420 --> 01:20:32,856
I think I've always
been frank with you.

1233
01:20:32,923 --> 01:20:35,357
You'll never have
to say another word.

1234
01:20:35,426 --> 01:20:37,826
Excellent. Have you
told the studio yet?

1235
01:20:37,895 --> 01:20:39,192
Ah, fuck the studio.

1236
01:20:39,263 --> 01:20:41,697
Have you told
your business manager?

1237
01:20:41,766 --> 01:20:43,199
Fuck 'em, Claire.

1238
01:20:43,267 --> 01:20:46,668
You said all along there's
a fortune to be made

1239
01:20:46,737 --> 01:20:48,170
in stories about life...

1240
01:20:48,239 --> 01:20:50,867
the life force,
the creation of life,

1241
01:20:50,941 --> 01:20:52,875
the very instinct
for living.

1242
01:20:52,943 --> 01:20:55,343
Besides, I don't give
a shit about money.

1243
01:20:55,413 --> 01:20:57,847
I made more money
this year

1244
01:20:57,915 --> 01:21:00,383
than my father made
in his entire life.

1245
01:21:00,451 --> 01:21:02,385
At the rate I'm going,

1246
01:21:02,453 --> 01:21:04,887
I won't run out of money
for, uh...

1247
01:21:04,955 --> 01:21:09,358
well, 18... months,
anyway.

1248
01:21:14,899 --> 01:21:17,834
I'm going to make
the world a better place

1249
01:21:17,902 --> 01:21:19,335
for your new <i>bambina.</i>

1250
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:23,672
What's happening?

1251
01:21:23,741 --> 01:21:25,504
What's happening?

1252
01:21:25,576 --> 01:21:26,975
Well, let's see.

1253
01:21:28,913 --> 01:21:30,847
We're filling out forms.

1254
01:21:30,915 --> 01:21:32,849
We're being evaluated.

1255
01:21:32,917 --> 01:21:35,909
We're becoming
official foster parents,

1256
01:21:35,986 --> 01:21:38,511
which would be
the first step.

1257
01:21:41,392 --> 01:21:43,053
We're...

1258
01:21:45,196 --> 01:21:46,857
We're arguing.

1259
01:21:46,931 --> 01:21:48,023
We're talking.

1260
01:21:48,098 --> 01:21:52,296
We're... flirting
with marital disaster.

1261
01:21:55,272 --> 01:21:58,366
Mack and I
are both being...

1262
01:21:58,442 --> 01:22:02,572
passionately, unshakably
devoted to our own position.

1263
01:22:02,646 --> 01:22:05,877
Claire, may I be very,
very frank with you?

1264
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:08,885
Is it possible
this has come up

1265
01:22:08,953 --> 01:22:11,387
because Roberto's
about to move on

1266
01:22:11,455 --> 01:22:12,820
and you are
coincidentally

1267
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,323
approaching
a certain age?

1268
01:22:14,391 --> 01:22:16,154
As opposed to what?

1269
01:22:16,227 --> 01:22:18,422
As opposed to being
wildly in love

1270
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,827
with this particular baby

1271
01:22:19,897 --> 01:22:23,389
which I had in my house
for nine hours?

1272
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:27,563
Of course that's why
this has come up, Davis.

1273
01:22:27,638 --> 01:22:30,334
It's not that simple,
but, yes.

1274
01:22:30,407 --> 01:22:32,170
But is that
rational?

1275
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:33,835
Rational?

1276
01:22:33,911 --> 01:22:35,003
Reasonable,

1277
01:22:35,079 --> 01:22:37,013
feasible
for you and Mack?

1278
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,842
Well...

1279
01:22:44,922 --> 01:22:49,689
I guess
I'd have to say...

1280
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,921
I don't really care.

1281
01:22:54,198 --> 01:22:56,189
And it's
in Canoga Park.

1282
01:22:56,267 --> 01:22:58,701
A nice little apartment
complex, he says.

1283
01:22:58,769 --> 01:23:00,999
A friend of his
owns it,

1284
01:23:01,071 --> 01:23:02,197
his associate.

1285
01:23:02,273 --> 01:23:04,537
He'd be reasonable
with the rent.

1286
01:23:04,608 --> 01:23:05,700
Canoga Park?

1287
01:23:05,776 --> 01:23:06,868
Yeah, yeah.

1288
01:23:06,944 --> 01:23:09,378
That's a bunch of
white people, isn't it?

1289
01:23:09,446 --> 01:23:11,744
Uh, I don't know.

1290
01:23:18,389 --> 01:23:20,516
Yeah. Right.

1291
01:23:22,893 --> 01:23:25,225
He didn't want
to go to Cabo San Lucas?

1292
01:23:25,296 --> 01:23:26,820
He didn't say.

1293
01:23:26,897 --> 01:23:27,829
Hmm?

1294
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:28,830
Hi.

1295
01:23:28,899 --> 01:23:29,831
Hi.

1296
01:23:30,901 --> 01:23:32,493
- Hi.
- Hi.

1297
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:33,832
Do you know Jane?

1298
01:23:33,904 --> 01:23:34,836
Nope.

1299
01:23:34,905 --> 01:23:36,668
- This is Mack.
- Hi, Mack.

1300
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:37,672
Hi, Jane.

1301
01:23:37,741 --> 01:23:40,175
Do you want
to sit down?

1302
01:23:40,244 --> 01:23:43,680
Thanks. I got something
I should do upstairs.

1303
01:23:48,419 --> 01:23:50,853
I'm having
one of those days.

1304
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:51,853
Which kind?

1305
01:23:51,922 --> 01:23:53,355
I keep drifting.

1306
01:23:53,424 --> 01:23:56,359
I can't seem to carry
through on anything.

1307
01:23:56,427 --> 01:23:58,190
Like I'll say I have
to go upstairs,

1308
01:23:58,262 --> 01:24:02,255
but I don't want to,
so I don't go.

1309
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:04,767
Have a seat.

1310
01:24:04,835 --> 01:24:05,859
Thanks.

1311
01:24:05,936 --> 01:24:08,871
At the same time,
I'm feeling very free,

1312
01:24:08,939 --> 01:24:12,375
like I've got a little
buzz on or something.

1313
01:24:12,443 --> 01:24:14,206
Does that happen
to you?

1314
01:24:15,980 --> 01:24:19,381
It doesn't happen to me
as much as I'd like.

1315
01:24:19,450 --> 01:24:20,883
It's very pleasant.

1316
01:24:20,951 --> 01:24:23,579
What brought it on?
Maybe I'll try it.

1317
01:24:23,654 --> 01:24:26,088
I got up early
this morning.

1318
01:24:26,156 --> 01:24:28,386
Sometimes it helps
to be sleepy.

1319
01:24:28,459 --> 01:24:30,393
I got that part
down.

1320
01:24:30,461 --> 01:24:32,895
I went to see
this guy that helped me

1321
01:24:32,963 --> 01:24:35,898
when my car broke down...
he drives a tow truck.

1322
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,399
I really like him.

1323
01:24:37,468 --> 01:24:40,403
His daughter goes
to this deaf college

1324
01:24:40,471 --> 01:24:41,438
in Washington, D.C.

1325
01:24:41,505 --> 01:24:44,406
His wife left him.
He's kind of lonely,

1326
01:24:44,475 --> 01:24:46,409
but he seems
peaceful about it.

1327
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:47,637
That would be nice.

1328
01:24:47,711 --> 01:24:49,144
It would be great

1329
01:24:49,213 --> 01:24:51,909
if you could be
down about things

1330
01:24:51,982 --> 01:24:54,416
but still be
all right with it,

1331
01:24:54,485 --> 01:24:55,713
like, finally
accept the fact

1332
01:24:55,786 --> 01:24:58,914
you'll feel bad
most of the time

1333
01:24:58,989 --> 01:25:00,251
and not fight it.

1334
01:25:00,324 --> 01:25:03,816
It would also be nice
not to feel bad.

1335
01:25:03,894 --> 01:25:06,328
That's how you get
in trouble...

1336
01:25:06,397 --> 01:25:09,924
thinking how nice it'd
be to be happy more.

1337
01:25:13,937 --> 01:25:15,370
Jane, are you married?

1338
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:17,066
No.

1339
01:25:17,141 --> 01:25:19,666
Got a boyfriend?

1340
01:25:19,743 --> 01:25:20,675
No.

1341
01:25:20,744 --> 01:25:24,305
Would you like
to meet this guy?

1342
01:25:26,483 --> 01:25:29,418
I don't know.
What does he look like?

1343
01:25:29,486 --> 01:25:30,919
How important is that?

1344
01:25:30,988 --> 01:25:31,920
Somewhat important.

1345
01:25:31,989 --> 01:25:33,923
No, I was
just curious.

1346
01:25:33,991 --> 01:25:38,587
I mean, he happens to be
a very handsome black guy.

1347
01:25:38,662 --> 01:25:41,096
I don't know
that much about him.

1348
01:25:41,165 --> 01:25:43,656
How are you going
to describe Jane?

1349
01:25:43,734 --> 01:25:46,532
Same way.

1350
01:25:46,603 --> 01:25:49,731
A very handsome
black guy.

1351
01:25:49,807 --> 01:25:50,967
Yeah.

1352
01:25:54,078 --> 01:25:56,580
Mama, there's
a man here.

1353
01:25:58,982 --> 01:25:59,914
Yes?

1354
01:25:59,983 --> 01:26:01,416
Hello, Mrs. Dotson.

1355
01:26:01,484 --> 01:26:03,918
You've got a polite
little lady there.

1356
01:26:03,987 --> 01:26:05,420
What is it?

1357
01:26:05,488 --> 01:26:06,921
My name's
Harvey Charles.

1358
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:07,957
I represent

1359
01:26:08,024 --> 01:26:08,922
the Ohio Continental
Insurance Company.

1360
01:26:08,992 --> 01:26:10,289
Here's my card.

1361
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:11,292
You're selling
insurance?

1362
01:26:11,361 --> 01:26:12,225
Yes, ma'am.

1363
01:26:12,295 --> 01:26:13,853
We don't want
life insurance.

1364
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:15,659
That's what
most people say.

1365
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:19,224
Our policies only
cost $10 per month.

1366
01:26:19,302 --> 01:26:22,738
Mister, I'm too young to be
getting life insurance.

1367
01:26:22,806 --> 01:26:25,240
We're not just
talking about you.

1368
01:26:25,308 --> 01:26:26,741
Think about
your children.

1369
01:26:26,810 --> 01:26:29,745
I ask you only
one thing, Mrs. Dotson.

1370
01:26:29,813 --> 01:26:31,644
Just glance at these
news clippings

1371
01:26:31,715 --> 01:26:33,580
here in my hand.

1372
01:26:33,650 --> 01:26:35,083
What about them?

1373
01:26:35,151 --> 01:26:37,381
What they show
in frightening detail

1374
01:26:37,454 --> 01:26:40,389
is the high rate
of violent death

1375
01:26:40,457 --> 01:26:42,391
caused by gangs
and crime

1376
01:26:42,459 --> 01:26:43,391
in your neighborhood.

1377
01:26:43,460 --> 01:26:46,691
Can I hand these
to you to look at?

1378
01:26:46,763 --> 01:26:48,196
Look, Mrs. Dotson,

1379
01:26:48,264 --> 01:26:49,891
I'm not going
to kid you.

1380
01:26:49,966 --> 01:26:51,399
These policies
are inexpensive

1381
01:26:51,468 --> 01:26:53,402
because the benefits
aren't that big

1382
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:54,801
when they pay off,

1383
01:26:54,871 --> 01:26:57,897
but what they'll do is,
if harm should come

1384
01:26:57,974 --> 01:27:00,568
to one of your children,
this policy will cover

1385
01:27:00,644 --> 01:27:02,578
all funeral expenses
and arrangements...

1386
01:27:02,646 --> 01:27:05,080
Kelley, go wait
in the kitchen.

1387
01:27:05,148 --> 01:27:06,080
What?

1388
01:27:06,149 --> 01:27:07,411
Go.

1389
01:27:07,484 --> 01:27:10,419
You trying to sell me
life insurance policies

1390
01:27:10,487 --> 01:27:11,852
on my kids?

1391
01:27:11,921 --> 01:27:14,856
Ma'am, they're the ones
on the front line.

1392
01:27:14,924 --> 01:27:16,858
They're the ones
in danger.

1393
01:27:16,926 --> 01:27:19,690
You get the fuck
off my porch!

1394
01:27:19,763 --> 01:27:22,288
I said get away
from my house, damn it!

1395
01:27:50,694 --> 01:27:52,127
Bottom of the list.

1396
01:27:52,195 --> 01:27:53,628
Who needs them?

1397
01:27:53,697 --> 01:27:56,222
Beaufort, South Carolina?

1398
01:27:56,299 --> 01:27:58,631
My mother tryin'
to keep the baby.

1399
01:27:58,702 --> 01:28:00,499
You need her as much
as she needs you.

1400
01:28:20,423 --> 01:28:22,357
It's big
for the money.

1401
01:28:22,425 --> 01:28:23,858
It's not beautiful,

1402
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:26,361
but they keep it up
pretty good.

1403
01:28:26,429 --> 01:28:29,364
They have their share
of gangs here, too.

1404
01:28:29,432 --> 01:28:32,367
But they don't
run the place.

1405
01:28:32,435 --> 01:28:34,528
Not yet anyway.

1406
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:39,200
I guess Kelley would
eventually adjust.

1407
01:28:39,275 --> 01:28:41,209
Is it always
this hot?

1408
01:28:41,277 --> 01:28:42,209
Yeah.

1409
01:28:42,278 --> 01:28:45,372
Deborah's
really confused.

1410
01:28:45,448 --> 01:28:46,881
It's a big move,

1411
01:28:46,950 --> 01:28:50,386
and I don't know what
to tell her, either.

1412
01:28:50,453 --> 01:28:54,321
Either way,
thank you, man.

1413
01:29:49,012 --> 01:29:53,142
Excuse me. Are you
Roberto's mother?

1414
01:29:53,216 --> 01:29:54,148
Yes.

1415
01:29:54,217 --> 01:29:55,650
We're Amanda's parents.

1416
01:29:55,718 --> 01:29:58,653
I'm Steve Fox.
This is my wife Cathy.

1417
01:29:58,721 --> 01:29:59,653
Hi. Claire.

1418
01:29:59,722 --> 01:30:02,156
We can't wait
to meet Roberto.

1419
01:30:02,225 --> 01:30:05,160
Feel like we know
him from Amanda's letters.

1420
01:30:05,228 --> 01:30:06,160
I'm sorry.

1421
01:30:06,229 --> 01:30:08,163
I'm afraid that
Roberto doesn't write

1422
01:30:08,231 --> 01:30:09,892
as much as he should.

1423
01:30:09,966 --> 01:30:13,060
We're very pleased
about Thanksgiving.

1424
01:30:13,136 --> 01:30:14,068
Thanksgiving?

1425
01:30:14,137 --> 01:30:16,071
It's so good of you

1426
01:30:16,139 --> 01:30:18,972
to let Roberto come
to San Diego.

1427
01:30:19,042 --> 01:30:22,978
Gosh, I'm sorry. I guess
you may not have heard

1428
01:30:23,046 --> 01:30:25,344
everything
about this summer.

1429
01:30:25,415 --> 01:30:28,714
I'm beginning
to get the picture.

1430
01:30:35,692 --> 01:30:37,284
There's my parents.

1431
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,349
Which ones?

1432
01:30:38,428 --> 01:30:41,886
See the man
in the beard?

1433
01:30:41,965 --> 01:30:45,924
Oh, God. They're
talking to my mother.

1434
01:31:13,930 --> 01:31:16,797
They were relieved
I wasn't Puerto Rican.

1435
01:31:16,866 --> 01:31:18,356
Amanda didn't
explain that

1436
01:31:18,434 --> 01:31:20,368
in the many,
many letters

1437
01:31:20,436 --> 01:31:22,097
that she wrote
to <i>her</i> parents?

1438
01:31:22,171 --> 01:31:24,105
I hope they're
not bigots.

1439
01:31:24,173 --> 01:31:27,040
Did you want
to tell me about it?

1440
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:28,042
What?

1441
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:29,669
What happened
this summer.

1442
01:31:29,746 --> 01:31:30,678
At camp?

1443
01:31:30,747 --> 01:31:31,771
Oh, camp was O.K.

1444
01:31:31,848 --> 01:31:34,180
I really
missed you, kid.

1445
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:35,979
I'm glad you're back.

1446
01:31:36,052 --> 01:31:37,485
Yeah. Me, too.

1447
01:31:37,553 --> 01:31:39,680
I'm sorry about
that Thanksgiving thing.

1448
01:31:39,756 --> 01:31:41,690
We'll talk to
your father about it.

1449
01:31:41,758 --> 01:31:43,191
It's O.K. with you?

1450
01:31:43,259 --> 01:31:44,590
I didn't say that.

1451
01:31:44,661 --> 01:31:45,593
But your mind's open?

1452
01:31:45,662 --> 01:31:46,594
Roberto.

1453
01:31:46,663 --> 01:31:47,595
O.K. Remain calm.

1454
01:31:47,664 --> 01:31:49,859
Let me ask you
something.

1455
01:31:49,933 --> 01:31:51,867
How open
is your mind?

1456
01:31:51,935 --> 01:31:54,665
Is this going to be
about my hair?

1457
01:31:54,737 --> 01:31:56,864
No. This is something
pretty big.

1458
01:31:56,940 --> 01:31:58,373
About me?

1459
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:00,807
Only partly.
It involves you.

1460
01:32:00,877 --> 01:32:03,607
Are you and Dad
splitting?

1461
01:32:05,448 --> 01:32:07,382
Why do you say that?

1462
01:32:07,450 --> 01:32:08,883
Is that it?

1463
01:32:08,952 --> 01:32:10,385
No. Absolutely no.

1464
01:32:10,453 --> 01:32:13,320
Why would you say
a thing like that?

1465
01:32:13,389 --> 01:32:15,653
Do we look like we're
about to split?

1466
01:32:15,725 --> 01:32:18,819
I don't know. People
do it all the time.

1467
01:32:18,895 --> 01:32:20,487
They look
like they're fine.

1468
01:32:20,563 --> 01:32:22,997
I am crazy
for your father.

1469
01:32:23,066 --> 01:32:25,500
Are we giving you
any sign

1470
01:32:25,568 --> 01:32:27,536
that we're
having trouble?

1471
01:32:27,603 --> 01:32:32,097
So, um, what were
you going to tell me?

1472
01:32:32,175 --> 01:32:34,541
Wait a minute.
Answer me.

1473
01:32:34,610 --> 01:32:39,343
I, um, sometimes it just
looks like you're both

1474
01:32:39,415 --> 01:32:40,848
kind of unhappy,
O.K.?

1475
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:42,350
Maybe I misunderstood.

1476
01:32:42,418 --> 01:32:46,684
It just looked like that
a lot before I went away.

1477
01:32:46,756 --> 01:32:48,348
Really?

1478
01:32:48,424 --> 01:32:51,359
Yeah, but look... look,
I'm glad I'm wrong.

1479
01:32:51,427 --> 01:32:54,362
I mean, God, that
would be horrible.

1480
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:56,864
I hope you guys
never split.

1481
01:32:56,933 --> 01:32:58,628
I'm sorry
I said it.

1482
01:32:58,701 --> 01:33:00,896
What were you
going to tell me?

1483
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:03,905
What do I have to have
an open mind about?

1484
01:33:03,973 --> 01:33:05,907
We'll talk
about it later.

1485
01:33:05,975 --> 01:33:10,435
Oh, Mom, just pretend I never
said anything and tell me.

1486
01:33:10,513 --> 01:33:11,445
Um...

1487
01:33:11,514 --> 01:33:12,378
Ahem.

1488
01:33:12,448 --> 01:33:14,882
Your father and I
are discussing

1489
01:33:14,951 --> 01:33:18,409
whether to adopt
a little girl.

1490
01:33:19,589 --> 01:33:21,113
What?

1491
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:33,525
To, uh, you know,
the evening.

1492
01:33:33,603 --> 01:33:34,934
Some playboy, huh?

1493
01:33:35,004 --> 01:33:36,437
Yeah.

1494
01:33:36,506 --> 01:33:37,438
Nice car.

1495
01:33:37,507 --> 01:33:38,872
Oh, thank you.

1496
01:33:38,941 --> 01:33:39,930
It's yellow.

1497
01:33:40,009 --> 01:33:41,943
Yeah, of course
it's yellow.

1498
01:33:42,011 --> 01:33:44,946
God, what am
I thinking of?

1499
01:33:45,014 --> 01:33:46,242
All right.

1500
01:33:52,221 --> 01:33:53,620
Ooh, boy.

1501
01:34:02,532 --> 01:34:04,830
Uh, O.K.

1502
01:34:05,902 --> 01:34:08,894
I thought
you changed your mind.

1503
01:34:08,971 --> 01:34:11,462
Oh, no way.

1504
01:34:11,541 --> 01:34:15,375
It's just been a while
since I did this.

1505
01:34:15,445 --> 01:34:17,310
You haven't been
going out?

1506
01:34:17,380 --> 01:34:19,041
Oh, I go out
a little.

1507
01:34:19,115 --> 01:34:20,980
I just
can't remember

1508
01:34:21,050 --> 01:34:24,042
the last time
I was, uh, set up.

1509
01:34:24,120 --> 01:34:25,985
Fixed up.

1510
01:34:26,055 --> 01:34:27,044
Yeah.

1511
01:34:29,492 --> 01:34:34,520
So, what do you think
so far?

1512
01:34:34,597 --> 01:34:36,531
So far
it's all right.

1513
01:34:36,599 --> 01:34:38,191
I like it.

1514
01:34:39,502 --> 01:34:42,437
I'm just... I'm just
a little surprised.

1515
01:34:42,505 --> 01:34:44,439
Why? What did you
expect?

1516
01:34:44,507 --> 01:34:45,940
No, it's not you.

1517
01:34:46,008 --> 01:34:49,637
I'm just surprised
at how nervous I am.

1518
01:34:49,712 --> 01:34:50,644
Me, too.

1519
01:34:50,713 --> 01:34:51,645
Yeah?

1520
01:34:51,714 --> 01:34:52,840
Yeah.

1521
01:34:54,917 --> 01:34:56,350
That's all right.

1522
01:34:56,419 --> 01:34:57,943
At least now
we know that much

1523
01:34:58,020 --> 01:34:59,419
about each other.

1524
01:35:01,524 --> 01:35:04,960
Yeah. Um, Mack must
have had some reason

1525
01:35:05,027 --> 01:35:06,961
to think
this would work.

1526
01:35:07,029 --> 01:35:09,964
I guess you've known
him a while, huh?

1527
01:35:10,032 --> 01:35:12,466
I don't know him
at all.

1528
01:35:12,535 --> 01:35:14,469
Really?

1529
01:35:14,537 --> 01:35:15,663
Well.

1530
01:35:17,340 --> 01:35:19,865
I don't know him
much, either.

1531
01:35:19,942 --> 01:35:21,842
Hmm, that's funny.

1532
01:35:24,547 --> 01:35:26,310
Maybe we're the only
two black people

1533
01:35:26,382 --> 01:35:27,815
he ever met.

1534
01:36:10,159 --> 01:36:12,957
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

1535
01:36:13,029 --> 01:36:14,189
You're trying to help.

1536
01:36:14,263 --> 01:36:15,195
You think moving
to Canoga Park's

1537
01:36:15,264 --> 01:36:16,925
gonna save that family?

1538
01:36:16,999 --> 01:36:19,467
Who said you have
to save anybody?

1539
01:36:19,535 --> 01:36:22,470
Maybe out there the kids
won't get hurt. Who knows?

1540
01:36:22,538 --> 01:36:25,939
They'll go or not go.
You're not responsible.

1541
01:36:26,008 --> 01:36:28,875
You just happen
to know a guy

1542
01:36:28,945 --> 01:36:30,879
who owns
an apartment house.

1543
01:36:30,947 --> 01:36:34,110
Why am I fixing Simon
up with some girl?

1544
01:36:34,183 --> 01:36:35,275
I do this shit,

1545
01:36:35,351 --> 01:36:37,979
and the next morning
I'm astounded.

1546
01:36:38,054 --> 01:36:39,021
Has it occurred to you

1547
01:36:39,088 --> 01:36:41,488
it doesn't really matter
all that much?

1548
01:36:41,557 --> 01:36:42,990
Why should you be

1549
01:36:43,059 --> 01:36:45,493
the one person on earth
who acts rationally?

1550
01:36:45,561 --> 01:36:46,493
Forget rational.

1551
01:36:46,562 --> 01:36:48,496
I'm completely
out of control.

1552
01:36:48,564 --> 01:36:50,498
Stop me
before I kill.

1553
01:36:50,566 --> 01:36:51,999
So? Good for you.

1554
01:36:52,068 --> 01:36:55,504
Aren't you sick of trying
to be in control

1555
01:36:55,571 --> 01:36:57,004
all the time?

1556
01:36:57,073 --> 01:36:58,005
I am.

1557
01:36:58,074 --> 01:37:01,009
Mack, you think
I want that baby

1558
01:37:01,077 --> 01:37:04,012
because I've got
some hole in my life

1559
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:07,015
or I think I'll have
some hole in my life,

1560
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:09,517
but that's not it,

1561
01:37:09,585 --> 01:37:11,610
or it's just
a part of it.

1562
01:37:11,687 --> 01:37:14,451
That baby needs someone
to take care of it.

1563
01:37:14,523 --> 01:37:15,956
It has to be you?

1564
01:37:16,025 --> 01:37:17,788
I believe there's
a reason I found her.

1565
01:37:17,860 --> 01:37:21,296
Dismiss it all you want,
but I'll always believe that.

1566
01:37:21,364 --> 01:37:24,800
You told me you thought
there was a reason

1567
01:37:24,867 --> 01:37:28,166
this guy... this Simon...
showed up and saved you.

1568
01:37:28,237 --> 01:37:29,295
I did?

1569
01:37:29,372 --> 01:37:32,899
How do you think that
I feel about this baby?

1570
01:37:32,975 --> 01:37:35,409
What if I
hadn't heard it?

1571
01:37:35,478 --> 01:37:37,912
What if no one
had heard her?

1572
01:37:37,980 --> 01:37:40,915
We would've read
about it in the <i>Times.</i>

1573
01:37:40,983 --> 01:37:42,314
"Oh, my God.
They found a dead baby

1574
01:37:42,385 --> 01:37:44,876
under the bushes
on Carmelina."

1575
01:37:44,954 --> 01:37:48,890
"Mack, I must have run right
by it the other morning."

1576
01:37:48,958 --> 01:37:50,391
But that
didn't happen.

1577
01:37:50,459 --> 01:37:53,895
I found her, and maybe
I saved her life

1578
01:37:53,963 --> 01:37:56,932
just the way maybe Simon
saved yours.

1579
01:37:56,999 --> 01:37:58,432
What are you saying?

1580
01:37:58,501 --> 01:37:59,934
Something
has happened.

1581
01:38:00,002 --> 01:38:03,438
You can't go back
and have it not happen.

1582
01:38:03,506 --> 01:38:05,565
Some connection
has been made

1583
01:38:05,641 --> 01:38:07,268
and has to be played out.

1584
01:38:07,343 --> 01:38:10,779
That is why you can't stay
out of Simon's business.

1585
01:38:10,846 --> 01:38:13,781
It's like this itch
you've got to scratch.

1586
01:38:13,849 --> 01:38:15,111
Claire,
you're talking about

1587
01:38:15,184 --> 01:38:16,617
a lifelong commitment.

1588
01:38:16,686 --> 01:38:18,586
I won't be dealing
with this Simon

1589
01:38:18,654 --> 01:38:20,019
the rest of my life.

1590
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:22,489
How do you know
he won't be your friend

1591
01:38:22,558 --> 01:38:23,957
until the day that you die?

1592
01:38:28,531 --> 01:38:30,897
What if these
are miracles, Mack?

1593
01:38:30,967 --> 01:38:33,902
Maybe we don't have
any experience with miracles

1594
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:36,404
so we're slow
to recognize them.

1595
01:38:36,472 --> 01:38:38,406
I'm getting
a terrific headache.

1596
01:38:38,474 --> 01:38:39,907
No, you're not.

1597
01:38:39,976 --> 01:38:41,068
I'm not?

1598
01:38:41,143 --> 01:38:43,805
I'll tell you why
I reject your headache.

1599
01:38:43,879 --> 01:38:45,312
Because
it's inappropriate.

1600
01:38:45,381 --> 01:38:46,507
Inappropriate?

1601
01:38:46,582 --> 01:38:48,015
If I'm right

1602
01:38:48,084 --> 01:38:49,415
and these events
are truly miracles,

1603
01:38:49,485 --> 01:38:52,420
then it's an inappropriate
response to get a headache

1604
01:38:52,488 --> 01:38:54,149
in the presence
of a miracle.

1605
01:39:10,006 --> 01:39:10,938
Wow.

1606
01:39:11,007 --> 01:39:11,939
Yeah.

1607
01:39:12,008 --> 01:39:13,942
I don't know
about you,

1608
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:17,946
but I'm thinking this Mack
must be some kind of genius.

1609
01:39:18,014 --> 01:39:19,948
Do you believe
in fate?

1610
01:39:20,016 --> 01:39:21,449
I believe in luck.

1611
01:39:21,517 --> 01:39:24,452
Do you think
you should come up?

1612
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:27,455
Do I think
I should come up?

1613
01:39:27,523 --> 01:39:28,888
What do you think?

1614
01:39:28,958 --> 01:39:32,894
Well, I think this night
has gone about as well

1615
01:39:32,962 --> 01:39:34,395
as it possibly could.

1616
01:39:34,463 --> 01:39:37,227
I don't want
to push our luck.

1617
01:39:44,974 --> 01:39:48,000
Is it O.K. to call you
at work?

1618
01:39:48,077 --> 01:39:50,011
I look forward
to it.

1619
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:53,981
This is a feeling I'd like
to have at work.

1620
01:39:54,050 --> 01:39:56,484
What is it?

1621
01:40:03,993 --> 01:40:05,824
Ohh.

1622
01:40:05,895 --> 01:40:08,261
Bye, Simon.

1623
01:40:08,330 --> 01:40:10,594
Say that again.

1624
01:40:10,666 --> 01:40:12,258
Simon.

1625
01:41:10,993 --> 01:41:11,925
You O.K.?

1626
01:41:15,998 --> 01:41:17,431
Whoa.

1627
01:41:17,499 --> 01:41:18,932
You sure?

1628
01:41:21,003 --> 01:41:23,938
Why don't you just
pull right over there?

1629
01:41:37,219 --> 01:41:39,881
Didn't see him coming,
did you?

1630
01:41:39,955 --> 01:41:42,389
I still don't know
what happened.

1631
01:41:42,457 --> 01:41:44,391
I guess you were lucky,

1632
01:41:44,459 --> 01:41:48,896
even though it might not
seem that way right now.

1633
01:41:48,964 --> 01:41:51,398
Pretty scary stuff.

1634
01:41:51,466 --> 01:41:54,401
I was crying
before it happened.

1635
01:41:54,469 --> 01:41:55,902
Really?

1636
01:41:55,971 --> 01:41:59,407
I don't cry this easily
normally.

1637
01:41:59,474 --> 01:42:00,907
Sorry.

1638
01:42:00,976 --> 01:42:02,409
Don't apologize.

1639
01:42:02,477 --> 01:42:05,412
You want to get out
of there for a second?

1640
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:07,414
Walk around
and catch your breath?

1641
01:42:07,482 --> 01:42:09,416
Come on.
You'll feel better.

1642
01:42:20,495 --> 01:42:21,427
You O.K.?

1643
01:42:22,998 --> 01:42:25,933
Then I guess
I better hang on.

1644
01:42:26,001 --> 01:42:28,435
Don't imagine
you want to talk about it

1645
01:42:28,503 --> 01:42:30,368
with a complete stranger.

1646
01:42:30,439 --> 01:42:33,875
I'm in love
with a married man.

1647
01:42:33,942 --> 01:42:36,376
We haven't been
having an affair.

1648
01:42:36,445 --> 01:42:37,878
He wouldn't do it.

1649
01:42:37,946 --> 01:42:40,380
We just had
one night together.

1650
01:42:40,449 --> 01:42:43,885
One really
amazing night.

1651
01:42:43,952 --> 01:42:44,884
Uh-huh.

1652
01:42:47,456 --> 01:42:49,390
Do you think
that's awful?

1653
01:42:52,461 --> 01:42:53,393
Which part?

1654
01:42:53,462 --> 01:42:54,895
All of it.

1655
01:42:56,465 --> 01:42:58,956
I think it happens.

1656
01:42:59,034 --> 01:43:01,901
Did he treat you bad?

1657
01:43:01,970 --> 01:43:03,904
It hurts.

1658
01:43:03,972 --> 01:43:05,906
When you love someone

1659
01:43:05,974 --> 01:43:08,909
and they
don't choose you...

1660
01:43:10,979 --> 01:43:13,243
it's bad.

1661
01:43:13,315 --> 01:43:17,479
That's the way
he's been bad to me.

1662
01:43:19,488 --> 01:43:21,922
Married men suck...

1663
01:43:21,990 --> 01:43:23,924
by definition.

1664
01:43:25,994 --> 01:43:27,928
Are you married?

1665
01:43:27,996 --> 01:43:29,930
Tell the truth.

1666
01:43:34,002 --> 01:43:35,936
No, I'm not married.

1667
01:43:38,006 --> 01:43:40,668
I haven't found
the right girl.

1668
01:43:45,314 --> 01:43:47,305
Can't quit now, babe.

1669
01:43:47,382 --> 01:43:48,815
Last mile.

1670
01:43:48,884 --> 01:43:51,318
Catching my second wind,
man, shoot.

1671
01:43:52,888 --> 01:43:53,820
Oh, man.

1672
01:44:00,395 --> 01:44:01,828
That's all there is.

1673
01:44:01,897 --> 01:44:03,330
We did it, man.

1674
01:44:08,904 --> 01:44:10,337
Just put it anywhere.

1675
01:44:12,407 --> 01:44:14,341
That's the end of it,
baby.

1676
01:44:14,409 --> 01:44:15,341
Good.

1677
01:44:23,919 --> 01:44:26,353
I don't know
if he's even gonna

1678
01:44:26,421 --> 01:44:27,854
stay here tonight.

1679
01:44:27,923 --> 01:44:29,720
Well, let's get a beer.

1680
01:44:54,883 --> 01:44:57,943
Get out of the way, man!

1681
01:45:20,142 --> 01:45:21,837
This is fucked.

1682
01:45:23,912 --> 01:45:25,846
What you doing, man?

1683
01:45:28,850 --> 01:45:30,784
No talking, huh?

1684
01:45:30,852 --> 01:45:32,285
That's cool.

1685
01:45:36,858 --> 01:45:39,793
That's cool. I guess you
don't want no company.

1686
01:45:39,861 --> 01:45:42,295
I thought you
was talking to me.

1687
01:45:42,364 --> 01:45:44,798
I thought you said
I was fucked up.

1688
01:45:44,866 --> 01:45:46,834
I wasn't talking
to your sorry ass.

1689
01:45:46,902 --> 01:45:49,302
Who the fuck
were you talking to?

1690
01:45:49,371 --> 01:45:51,305
Were you talking
to yourself?

1691
01:45:57,879 --> 01:45:59,312
What's up, man?

1692
01:45:59,381 --> 01:46:01,542
Hey, that dude
was quick.

1693
01:46:01,616 --> 01:46:04,084
Must have come here
from Beirut.

1694
01:47:00,375 --> 01:47:04,539
<i>You, stop running and put</i>
<i>your hands behind your head.</i>

1695
01:47:04,613 --> 01:47:08,140
<i>Stop running and put</i>
<i>your hands behind your head.</i>

1696
01:47:10,485 --> 01:47:11,816
Here we go.

1697
01:47:19,394 --> 01:47:20,520
Halt!

1698
01:47:20,595 --> 01:47:21,823
Halt!

1699
01:47:21,897 --> 01:47:25,162
Turn around and get down
on your stomach.

1700
01:47:25,233 --> 01:47:27,326
Turn around and get down
on your stomach!

1701
01:47:27,402 --> 01:47:28,334
What?

1702
01:47:28,403 --> 01:47:30,701
Down, asshole,
and I mean now!

1703
01:47:35,343 --> 01:47:38,801
Put your right hand
behind your back.

1704
01:47:40,348 --> 01:47:42,282
Bring the other one
around.

1705
01:47:43,851 --> 01:47:46,285
Don't you know
what stop means?

1706
01:47:46,354 --> 01:47:49,221
Where you going
in such a hurry, pal?

1707
01:47:50,858 --> 01:47:52,792
Nowhere.
I'm just running.

1708
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:54,384
Running from what?

1709
01:47:54,462 --> 01:47:56,794
Nothing.
I live around here.

1710
01:47:56,864 --> 01:47:57,796
Where?

1711
01:48:00,368 --> 01:48:01,801
I don't know.

1712
01:48:01,869 --> 01:48:04,531
You don't know?
What's that supposed to mean?

1713
01:48:04,606 --> 01:48:07,040
Back there across
from the park.

1714
01:48:07,108 --> 01:48:08,302
What park?

1715
01:48:10,878 --> 01:48:12,311
I don't know.

1716
01:48:41,342 --> 01:48:43,367
They almost smoked me!

1717
01:48:43,444 --> 01:48:45,275
See a nigger
run around here,

1718
01:48:45,346 --> 01:48:47,780
they smoke you,
ask questions later.

1719
01:48:47,849 --> 01:48:49,646
I ain't staying here,
I'll tell you that.

1720
01:48:49,717 --> 01:48:51,981
I ain't fucking staying!

1721
01:48:56,858 --> 01:48:58,655
What's next?

1722
01:48:58,726 --> 01:49:01,524
Nothing. I'm quitting.

1723
01:49:05,867 --> 01:49:07,198
Tell me.

1724
01:49:07,268 --> 01:49:08,895
This is intolerable.

1725
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:11,905
I can't do this anymore.
It's sick.

1726
01:49:11,973 --> 01:49:14,305
I need to go on.

1727
01:49:14,375 --> 01:49:16,775
Don't act like
you're not relieved.

1728
01:49:16,844 --> 01:49:18,277
I know you are.

1729
01:49:18,346 --> 01:49:20,541
I don't want you to go.

1730
01:49:20,615 --> 01:49:22,776
You know
what your trouble is?

1731
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:25,819
You just never want
to be the bad guy.

1732
01:49:25,887 --> 01:49:29,220
You want everything you do
to be O.K.,

1733
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:31,053
but it isn't.

1734
01:49:31,125 --> 01:49:32,558
If you didn't want this
to happen,

1735
01:49:32,627 --> 01:49:34,561
then you shouldn't have
fucked me.

1736
01:49:34,629 --> 01:49:37,359
I'm sorry. I think
I've said that before.

1737
01:49:37,432 --> 01:49:39,491
But you didn't mean it.

1738
01:49:39,567 --> 01:49:44,698
You aren't really sorry
it happened, are you?

1739
01:49:44,772 --> 01:49:46,569
Are you?

1740
01:49:54,449 --> 01:49:57,384
You've denied me
in every way you can.

1741
01:49:57,452 --> 01:50:00,421
Everything I've wanted,
you've denied me.

1742
01:50:00,488 --> 01:50:02,388
I've been honest
with you all along.

1743
01:50:02,457 --> 01:50:03,549
Even that night.

1744
01:50:03,624 --> 01:50:05,091
Who gives a shit?

1745
01:50:05,159 --> 01:50:06,888
Don't you see
what you do?

1746
01:50:06,961 --> 01:50:09,395
Even now you deny me
what's rightfully mine.

1747
01:50:09,464 --> 01:50:10,396
Which is?

1748
01:50:10,465 --> 01:50:12,899
To resent the hell
out of you,

1749
01:50:12,967 --> 01:50:15,595
to feel totally rejected
and hated.

1750
01:50:15,670 --> 01:50:18,605
To hate you
for doing it to me.

1751
01:50:18,673 --> 01:50:21,904
There are a lot
of good men out there

1752
01:50:21,976 --> 01:50:25,912
who'll treat me like I'm
the very thing they want.

1753
01:50:29,917 --> 01:50:33,353
And then you do
that thing with Jane.

1754
01:50:33,421 --> 01:50:34,854
What?

1755
01:50:34,922 --> 01:50:37,857
You know,
with that guy?

1756
01:50:37,925 --> 01:50:39,859
That tow truck guy?

1757
01:50:39,927 --> 01:50:42,361
What's that got to do
with anything?

1758
01:50:42,430 --> 01:50:44,364
You don't even know,
do you?

1759
01:50:44,432 --> 01:50:47,367
You don't even know why
that hurts me so much.

1760
01:50:47,435 --> 01:50:49,926
Jane's in love.
She thinks he's the one.

1761
01:50:50,004 --> 01:50:52,131
Is that bad? I thought
she's your friend.

1762
01:50:52,206 --> 01:50:55,539
She is my friend.
I'm very happy for her,

1763
01:50:55,610 --> 01:50:57,874
but it makes me
feel like shit

1764
01:50:57,945 --> 01:51:00,880
that you're finding her
the love of her life

1765
01:51:00,948 --> 01:51:02,882
and I'm here like, what?

1766
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:05,384
I'm here like shit.

1767
01:51:05,453 --> 01:51:10,356
How do you think that's
going to make me feel?

1768
01:51:10,425 --> 01:51:13,394
Dee, look, I understand
you're angry with me,

1769
01:51:13,461 --> 01:51:15,122
but why...

1770
01:51:15,196 --> 01:51:16,390
Forget it.

1771
01:51:17,965 --> 01:51:20,399
It doesn't have
to make sense.

1772
01:51:20,468 --> 01:51:22,402
I'll stay for two weeks,

1773
01:51:22,470 --> 01:51:24,904
but you better find
somebody else.

1774
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:32,843
Is Otis coming home
tonight, Mama?

1775
01:51:32,914 --> 01:51:34,848
No, baby.
I told you.

1776
01:51:36,918 --> 01:51:39,352
When will we
see him again?

1777
01:51:41,923 --> 01:51:43,356
I don't know,
honey.

1778
01:52:08,950 --> 01:52:09,974
Ha ha!

1779
01:52:34,909 --> 01:52:35,841
Yeah.

1780
01:52:39,847 --> 01:52:43,339
I just feel like
I'd really like to work

1781
01:52:43,417 --> 01:52:45,351
for a woman lawyer
this time.

1782
01:52:45,419 --> 01:52:48,354
I never have.
It might be a good thing.

1783
01:52:48,422 --> 01:52:50,822
I'm not sure you'd
find it much different,

1784
01:52:50,892 --> 01:52:51,859
but, frankly,

1785
01:52:51,926 --> 01:52:53,359
with your qualifications
and experience,

1786
01:52:53,427 --> 01:52:56,362
I have no desire
to discourage you.

1787
01:52:56,430 --> 01:52:57,863
I am curious though.

1788
01:52:57,932 --> 01:53:00,366
Your former employer
has written you

1789
01:53:00,434 --> 01:53:02,493
the most glorious
recommendation.

1790
01:53:02,570 --> 01:53:05,869
Why did you decide
to leave him?

1791
01:53:45,980 --> 01:53:47,914
Hey, Otis.

1792
01:53:51,485 --> 01:53:52,918
Hey, what's the matter?

1793
01:53:52,987 --> 01:53:53,919
You O.K.?

1794
01:53:53,988 --> 01:53:55,421
Yeah, I'm all right.

1795
01:53:55,489 --> 01:53:56,513
Hey...

1796
01:53:56,591 --> 01:53:57,922
you're...

1797
01:53:57,992 --> 01:53:59,926
you're hurt, boy.

1798
01:53:59,994 --> 01:54:02,428
It ain't my blood.

1799
01:54:04,498 --> 01:54:06,432
What happened?

1800
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:07,933
Hey, what happened?

1801
01:54:10,004 --> 01:54:12,438
I seen some bad shit,
Simon.

1802
01:54:26,920 --> 01:54:27,944
O.K.

1803
01:54:29,456 --> 01:54:30,889
O.K., O.K., O.K.

1804
01:54:39,966 --> 01:54:41,399
O.K.

1805
01:54:44,104 --> 01:54:46,538
<i>We have a three-car</i>
<i>collision to report</i>

1806
01:54:46,606 --> 01:54:49,541
<i>on the Santa Monica Freeway</i>
<i>east of National.</i>

1807
01:54:49,609 --> 01:54:51,042
<i>Only one lane is open.</i>

1808
01:54:51,111 --> 01:54:54,046
<i>And, Ted, the surface streets</i>
<i>are no picnic, either.</i>

1809
01:54:54,114 --> 01:54:57,174
<i>It is a jungle down there.</i>

1810
01:54:57,250 --> 01:55:00,048
And I realized it wasn't
both you and Mom

1811
01:55:00,120 --> 01:55:02,554
who were always saying
how glad you were

1812
01:55:02,622 --> 01:55:04,556
you didn't have
little kids anymore.

1813
01:55:04,624 --> 01:55:06,057
It was just you.

1814
01:55:06,126 --> 01:55:07,559
Mom never really
said that.

1815
01:55:07,627 --> 01:55:10,061
Which way are you
going to turn?

1816
01:55:10,130 --> 01:55:11,256
Right.

1817
01:55:11,331 --> 01:55:13,561
So what do you
want to do now?

1818
01:55:13,633 --> 01:55:16,431
Get in the right lane.

1819
01:55:18,205 --> 01:55:19,137
No!

1820
01:55:19,206 --> 01:55:21,071
Whoa!

1821
01:55:21,141 --> 01:55:24,804
Roberto, you can't just go
because you want to!

1822
01:55:24,878 --> 01:55:25,810
I... I messed up.

1823
01:55:25,879 --> 01:55:27,073
Make sure it's clear.

1824
01:55:27,147 --> 01:55:28,739
I messed up.

1825
01:55:30,584 --> 01:55:33,519
Better to go 10 blocks
out of your way

1826
01:55:33,587 --> 01:55:35,487
than try to get over
when it's impossible.

1827
01:55:35,555 --> 01:55:37,785
Watch this guy getting
out of his car here.

1828
01:55:37,858 --> 01:55:39,348
Slow down. Slow, slow.

1829
01:55:39,426 --> 01:55:40,393
Slow!

1830
01:55:41,595 --> 01:55:43,859
When I say stop,
you've got to stop.

1831
01:55:43,930 --> 01:55:44,862
You didn't say stop.

1832
01:55:44,931 --> 01:55:47,365
You told me
to slow down.

1833
01:55:47,434 --> 01:55:49,868
It won't matter
if you hit another car,

1834
01:55:49,936 --> 01:55:51,870
but you can't hit a person.

1835
01:55:51,938 --> 01:55:53,371
That's the most
important thing.

1836
01:55:53,440 --> 01:55:54,873
People are such assholes.

1837
01:55:54,941 --> 01:55:57,876
You got to watch out
for the dumbest stuff.

1838
01:55:59,579 --> 01:56:02,514
Just watch...
Just watch the road.

1839
01:56:09,689 --> 01:56:11,623
So why should I
tell Mom

1840
01:56:11,691 --> 01:56:13,556
she's crazy
to want this baby?

1841
01:56:13,627 --> 01:56:17,063
I don't want her telling
me my stuff is crazy.

1842
01:56:17,130 --> 01:56:18,563
Maybe it's
not so crazy.

1843
01:56:18,632 --> 01:56:20,065
It's her life.

1844
01:56:20,133 --> 01:56:21,065
And mine.

1845
01:56:21,134 --> 01:56:22,567
And yours,
too, I guess,

1846
01:56:22,636 --> 01:56:24,570
although she's
going to be

1847
01:56:24,638 --> 01:56:25,570
the one most involved.

1848
01:56:25,639 --> 01:56:28,073
Believe me it affects
us both, a lot.

1849
01:56:28,141 --> 01:56:29,335
Let's concentrate
on what we're doing.

1850
01:56:29,409 --> 01:56:31,001
What now?

1851
01:56:31,077 --> 01:56:34,103
Um, I'm going
to take a left.

1852
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:35,545
Really?

1853
01:56:35,615 --> 01:56:38,243
It's, uh...

1854
01:56:38,318 --> 01:56:39,876
kind of busy here,
isn't it?

1855
01:56:39,953 --> 01:56:42,581
Dad, I've got to
learn how to do it.

1856
01:56:42,656 --> 01:56:43,680
You're right.

1857
01:56:43,757 --> 01:56:45,019
Left turn signal.

1858
01:56:45,091 --> 01:56:46,319
Left turn signal.

1859
01:56:46,393 --> 01:56:47,325
Done.

1860
01:56:57,304 --> 01:57:00,273
O.K. This is good.
Right here.

1861
01:57:00,340 --> 01:57:01,864
Perfect.

1862
01:57:03,143 --> 01:57:05,873
If you only had
one life to live...

1863
01:57:05,946 --> 01:57:07,038
which you do...

1864
01:57:07,113 --> 01:57:10,048
And you really wanted
to do something

1865
01:57:10,116 --> 01:57:11,549
and Mom said
you couldn't,

1866
01:57:11,618 --> 01:57:13,813
how would that
make you feel?

1867
01:57:13,887 --> 01:57:15,878
Let's just think
about this turn.

1868
01:57:15,956 --> 01:57:17,048
All right.

1869
01:57:17,123 --> 01:57:18,556
What are you
watching for?

1870
01:57:18,625 --> 01:57:19,853
The light.

1871
01:57:19,926 --> 01:57:21,587
And? What's the most
important thing?

1872
01:57:21,661 --> 01:57:22,855
Don't hit a person.

1873
01:57:22,929 --> 01:57:24,294
No, I mean here.

1874
01:57:26,533 --> 01:57:29,024
Don't fuck around.
This is no joke.

1875
01:57:29,102 --> 01:57:30,091
Sorry.

1876
01:57:31,404 --> 01:57:34,339
Um, the most important
thing is that...

1877
01:57:34,407 --> 01:57:36,841
that those cars
have really stopped.

1878
01:57:36,910 --> 01:57:38,468
Right. Because?

1879
01:57:38,545 --> 01:57:40,979
Because some idiot
is always liable

1880
01:57:41,047 --> 01:57:42,446
to run a red light.

1881
01:57:42,515 --> 01:57:44,608
Good. What else
are you looking for?

1882
01:57:44,684 --> 01:57:47,517
Um... those cars
in the cross streets.

1883
01:57:47,587 --> 01:57:48,815
Good.

1884
01:57:51,024 --> 01:57:53,083
The light's
going to change.

1885
01:57:57,364 --> 01:57:58,490
This is good.

1886
01:57:59,833 --> 01:58:01,630
Wait.

1887
01:58:03,236 --> 01:58:04,464
Wait.

1888
01:58:09,776 --> 01:58:10,902
Not yet.

1889
01:58:12,412 --> 01:58:14,539
O.K.
They're stopping.

1890
01:58:15,882 --> 01:58:16,814
Go ahead.

1891
01:58:23,123 --> 01:58:24,090
Stop!

1892
01:58:26,860 --> 01:58:27,792
You idiot!

1893
01:58:27,861 --> 01:58:28,793
Fuck you!

1894
01:58:31,464 --> 01:58:32,863
Whoa!

1895
01:58:32,932 --> 01:58:33,864
Asshole!

1896
01:58:33,933 --> 01:58:36,993
This guy's letting us in.
Go, go, go.

1897
01:58:39,572 --> 01:58:43,508
When I tell you, you'll
be able to get over.

1898
01:58:43,576 --> 01:58:44,873
We'll pull over here.

1899
01:58:46,046 --> 01:58:47,377
O.K., go now.

1900
01:58:48,915 --> 01:58:50,849
Just pull it right over.

1901
01:58:53,686 --> 01:58:56,917
Y-Y-Y-Yes.

1902
01:59:01,428 --> 01:59:02,360
Shit.

1903
01:59:08,101 --> 01:59:10,035
That guy was a cretin.

1904
01:59:11,371 --> 01:59:15,205
It's so crazy out there,
you got to react really fast.

1905
01:59:15,275 --> 01:59:19,211
If you're going, you've only
got a split second to do it.

1906
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:21,543
Otherwise the cross traffic
will whack you.

1907
01:59:21,614 --> 01:59:22,546
Sorry, Dad.

1908
01:59:22,615 --> 01:59:24,549
Hey, this is
difficult stuff.

1909
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:26,551
Making a left turn
in L.A.

1910
01:59:26,619 --> 01:59:29,986
Is one of the harder things
you'll learn in life.

1911
01:59:30,056 --> 01:59:32,991
That guy was
almost in your lap.

1912
01:59:33,059 --> 01:59:34,492
Heh heh heh.

1913
01:59:34,561 --> 01:59:36,495
This town stinks.

1914
01:59:38,231 --> 01:59:39,721
Do you want to drive?

1915
01:59:39,799 --> 01:59:41,994
Hell, no.
I'm too shook up.

1916
01:59:43,069 --> 01:59:44,502
Let's get out of here.

1917
02:00:07,927 --> 02:00:11,863
So I guess we're going
to get this baby, huh?

1918
02:00:24,544 --> 02:00:25,704
Hello.

1919
02:00:27,113 --> 02:00:28,080
What?

1920
02:00:29,549 --> 02:00:31,744
We've got no Feiruz here.

1921
02:00:32,819 --> 02:00:34,844
You've got the wrong number.

1922
02:00:36,556 --> 02:00:37,648
Oh, really?

1923
02:00:37,724 --> 02:00:39,817
Well, fuck you also.

1924
02:00:44,731 --> 02:00:45,857
Who?

1925
02:00:47,066 --> 02:00:49,330
Feiruz. You know him?

1926
02:00:51,571 --> 02:00:53,903
My heart is pounding.

1927
02:00:57,577 --> 02:00:58,601
Ahh...

1928
02:00:58,678 --> 02:00:59,804
Come here.

1929
02:01:04,851 --> 02:01:06,011
It's O.K.

1930
02:01:06,085 --> 02:01:07,518
Hmm.

1931
02:01:10,590 --> 02:01:13,525
Everything seems
so close together.

1932
02:01:13,593 --> 02:01:16,027
Hmm?

1933
02:01:16,095 --> 02:01:19,792
All the good and bad
things in the world.

1934
02:01:19,866 --> 02:01:21,265
Everything.

1935
02:01:23,469 --> 02:01:26,029
I feel it in myself even.

1936
02:01:26,105 --> 02:01:27,697
And in us...

1937
02:01:27,774 --> 02:01:29,366
our marriage.

1938
02:01:33,213 --> 02:01:34,646
I love you, Claire.

1939
02:01:37,050 --> 02:01:40,349
I like living my life
with you.

1940
02:01:40,420 --> 02:01:41,682
Do you?

1941
02:01:43,556 --> 02:01:46,320
'Cause I love you
so much, Mack.

1942
02:01:48,361 --> 02:01:49,419
Ohh...

1943
02:02:13,886 --> 02:02:14,849
Drive me over
to the stage.

1944
02:02:14,884 --> 02:02:15,812
Drive me over
to the stage.

1945
02:02:15,888 --> 02:02:17,822
My car's
over by your office.

1946
02:02:17,890 --> 02:02:19,824
You can
take the cart back.

1947
02:02:19,892 --> 02:02:21,826
I got to get back
downtown.

1948
02:02:21,894 --> 02:02:23,054
Relax. No one's
going to get deported

1949
02:02:23,129 --> 02:02:25,825
while you drive me
to stage 20.

1950
02:02:25,898 --> 02:02:27,331
We spent the whole lunch

1951
02:02:27,400 --> 02:02:28,765
discussing your marriage
to Vanessa.

1952
02:02:28,835 --> 02:02:30,359
I didn't congratulate
you on the new direction

1953
02:02:30,436 --> 02:02:31,460
your career has taken.

1954
02:02:31,537 --> 02:02:32,765
On the what?

1955
02:02:32,839 --> 02:02:34,272
Claire told me.

1956
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:36,274
You know, the violence
in your movies.

1957
02:02:36,342 --> 02:02:37,604
She was so pleased.

1958
02:02:37,677 --> 02:02:39,201
Oh, that!
Oh, fuck that.

1959
02:02:39,279 --> 02:02:40,473
What?

1960
02:02:40,546 --> 02:02:41,672
That's over.

1961
02:02:41,748 --> 02:02:45,149
I must have been delirious
for a few weeks there.

1962
02:02:45,218 --> 02:02:46,651
Hi, Tim. How are you?

1963
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:50,155
Man, I don't want to be
the one to tell Claire

1964
02:02:50,223 --> 02:02:51,656
you changed your mind.

1965
02:02:51,724 --> 02:02:52,986
Changed nothing.
I regained my senses.

1966
02:02:53,059 --> 02:02:54,993
I was talking
like a moron.

1967
02:02:55,061 --> 02:02:56,494
Down here and go left.

1968
02:03:05,238 --> 02:03:06,330
What happened?

1969
02:03:06,406 --> 02:03:07,998
Nothing happened.

1970
02:03:08,074 --> 02:03:09,439
It never happened.

1971
02:03:09,509 --> 02:03:11,943
Look, Mack,
I'm an artist.

1972
02:03:12,011 --> 02:03:14,844
Now, go ahead and laugh,
because everybody does.

1973
02:03:14,914 --> 02:03:16,779
Nobody in this town
will admit

1974
02:03:16,849 --> 02:03:19,682
that a producer
is an artist.

1975
02:03:19,752 --> 02:03:21,083
But I know what I do.

1976
02:03:21,154 --> 02:03:22,678
I know how many
lame-o directors

1977
02:03:22,755 --> 02:03:25,952
I've carried on my back
and then watch as they take

1978
02:03:26,025 --> 02:03:28,687
all the glory,
reviews, and awards.

1979
02:03:28,761 --> 02:03:29,955
Which awards?

1980
02:03:30,029 --> 02:03:31,018
That's O.K.

1981
02:03:31,097 --> 02:03:32,860
I don't mind working
in modest anonymity.

1982
02:03:32,932 --> 02:03:34,866
That's the way
Thalberg did it, too.

1983
02:03:34,934 --> 02:03:36,868
If they're lame-o,
why hire them?

1984
02:03:36,936 --> 02:03:39,370
I haven't got time
to do it myself.

1985
02:03:39,439 --> 02:03:40,872
Hanging around the set
all day,

1986
02:03:40,940 --> 02:03:42,874
doing that boring
lighting and shit.

1987
02:03:42,942 --> 02:03:44,239
Let them do that.

1988
02:03:44,310 --> 02:03:46,710
That's beside the point.
The point is...

1989
02:03:46,779 --> 02:03:47,711
Turn around.

1990
02:03:47,780 --> 02:03:50,044
Turn around and
go back down there.

1991
02:03:55,188 --> 02:03:56,450
Where was I?

1992
02:03:56,522 --> 02:03:57,819
The point is...

1993
02:03:57,890 --> 02:03:59,721
there's a gulf
in this country,

1994
02:03:59,792 --> 02:04:01,054
an ever-widening abyss,

1995
02:04:01,127 --> 02:04:02,219
between the people
who have stuff

1996
02:04:02,295 --> 02:04:03,592
and the people
who don't have shit.

1997
02:04:03,663 --> 02:04:06,427
It's like this hole's
opened up in the ground

1998
02:04:06,499 --> 02:04:08,865
as big as the fucking
Grand Canyon

1999
02:04:08,935 --> 02:04:12,564
and what's come
pouring out... Hi.

2000
02:04:12,638 --> 02:04:14,071
My name's Davis,
building 78.

2001
02:04:14,140 --> 02:04:16,574
The whole building. Stop by.
I have something for you.

2002
02:04:16,642 --> 02:04:19,076
This is the greatest
town on earth.

2003
02:04:19,145 --> 02:04:20,578
Go left here.

2004
02:04:20,646 --> 02:04:22,079
Where was I?

2005
02:04:22,148 --> 02:04:23,581
The Grand Canyon.

2006
02:04:23,649 --> 02:04:24,741
Yeah.

2007
02:04:24,817 --> 02:04:27,081
And what's come out
of this big hole

2008
02:04:27,153 --> 02:04:28,518
is
an eruption of rage,

2009
02:04:28,588 --> 02:04:29,850
and the rage
creates violence,

2010
02:04:29,922 --> 02:04:31,321
and the violence
is real,

2011
02:04:31,391 --> 02:04:34,087
and nothing's going
to make it go away

2012
02:04:34,160 --> 02:04:35,627
until someone
changes something.

2013
02:04:35,695 --> 02:04:37,026
Which won't happen.

2014
02:04:37,096 --> 02:04:38,393
You and I
may not like it,

2015
02:04:38,464 --> 02:04:40,523
but I can't pretend
it isn't there,

2016
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:41,965
because that is a lie.

2017
02:04:42,034 --> 02:04:44,559
And when art lies,
it becomes worthless.

2018
02:04:44,637 --> 02:04:46,366
So I got to keep
telling the truth,

2019
02:04:46,439 --> 02:04:48,236
even if it scares
the shit out of me,

2020
02:04:48,307 --> 02:04:50,138
like it scares
the shit out of you,

2021
02:04:50,209 --> 02:04:53,042
even if it means
some motherfucker

2022
02:04:53,112 --> 02:04:55,706
can blow a big ol' hole
in my leg for a watch,

2023
02:04:55,782 --> 02:04:58,342
and I'm going to walk
with a fucking limp

2024
02:04:58,418 --> 02:05:00,648
the rest of my life
and count myself lucky.

2025
02:05:00,720 --> 02:05:02,654
That's what's amazing,
you know,

2026
02:05:02,722 --> 02:05:04,553
is what we count
as lucky today.

2027
02:05:04,624 --> 02:05:07,058
Our criteria for lucky
has changed a bit.

2028
02:05:07,126 --> 02:05:09,560
We're not talking
about great art here.

2029
02:05:09,629 --> 02:05:10,960
Says you, Mr. Snob,

2030
02:05:11,030 --> 02:05:12,258
Mr. Arbiter of Taste,

2031
02:05:12,331 --> 02:05:14,765
Mr. Immigration Lawyer
to the Arts.

2032
02:05:14,834 --> 02:05:16,233
I'll tell you this, though.

2033
02:05:16,302 --> 02:05:18,236
There's so much rage
going around

2034
02:05:18,304 --> 02:05:22,570
we're lucky we have the movies
to help us vent a little.

2035
02:05:22,642 --> 02:05:24,075
That line
is so tired.

2036
02:05:24,143 --> 02:05:25,576
I'm shocked
you'd use it.

2037
02:05:25,645 --> 02:05:28,011
You think just anyone
can do what I do?

2038
02:05:28,080 --> 02:05:30,514
You think anyone can make
the crap I make?

2039
02:05:30,583 --> 02:05:32,016
Wasn't there something

2040
02:05:32,084 --> 02:05:33,574
about "life force,"
"life-affirming"?

2041
02:05:33,653 --> 02:05:34,813
That's what Claire
told me.

2042
02:05:34,887 --> 02:05:35,819
This is life, pal.

2043
02:05:35,888 --> 02:05:37,082
That's what
I'm trying to get

2044
02:05:37,156 --> 02:05:38,214
through your thick,
sanctimonious skull.

2045
02:05:38,291 --> 02:05:39,553
There's always been
violence.

2046
02:05:39,625 --> 02:05:40,922
There will always
be violence...

2047
02:05:40,993 --> 02:05:43,484
violence and evil
and men with big guns.

2048
02:05:43,563 --> 02:05:45,463
My movies reflect
what's going on,

2049
02:05:45,531 --> 02:05:47,294
they don't make
what's going on.

2050
02:05:47,366 --> 02:05:49,857
And if I happen to make 'em
better than anyone,

2051
02:05:49,936 --> 02:05:51,995
then I've got a bigger
responsibility than anyone

2052
02:05:52,071 --> 02:05:53,504
to serve it up.

2053
02:05:55,608 --> 02:05:58,042
Mack, you ever seen
a movie

2054
02:05:58,110 --> 02:05:59,543
called
<i>Sullivan's Travels?</i>

2055
02:05:59,612 --> 02:06:00,704
No.

2056
02:06:00,780 --> 02:06:02,077
That's part
of your problem.

2057
02:06:02,148 --> 02:06:03,479
You haven't seen
enough movies.

2058
02:06:03,549 --> 02:06:04,538
All of life's riddles

2059
02:06:04,617 --> 02:06:06,642
are answered
in the movies.

2060
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:09,620
It's a story about a man
who loses his way.

2061
02:06:09,689 --> 02:06:10,815
He's a filmmaker,
like me.

2062
02:06:10,890 --> 02:06:13,085
He forgets
for a moment

2063
02:06:13,159 --> 02:06:15,389
what he was set
on earth to do.

2064
02:06:15,461 --> 02:06:18,555
Fortunately,
he finds his way back.

2065
02:06:18,631 --> 02:06:19,893
That can happen, Mack.

2066
02:06:22,235 --> 02:06:23,566
Check it out.

2067
02:07:01,874 --> 02:07:03,307
Ha ha ha ha!

2068
02:07:03,376 --> 02:07:05,310
You're kind of big,
aren't you?

2069
02:07:05,378 --> 02:07:07,812
You look about
ready to play.

2070
02:07:07,880 --> 02:07:08,904
Yeah, maybe.

2071
02:07:08,981 --> 02:07:12,007
I want to see you
shoot from the outside.

2072
02:07:14,554 --> 02:07:16,184
What made you
get me together with Jane?

2073
02:07:16,219 --> 02:07:17,814
What made you
get me together with Jane?

2074
02:07:17,855 --> 02:07:19,345
Dumbness, I guess.

2075
02:07:19,424 --> 02:07:21,415
Compulsion
to stick my nose

2076
02:07:21,492 --> 02:07:22,891
where it doesn't
belong.

2077
02:07:22,960 --> 02:07:24,359
Why,
has it ended badly?

2078
02:07:24,429 --> 02:07:25,862
No, it hasn't ended.

2079
02:07:25,930 --> 02:07:27,795
She's the best thing

2080
02:07:27,865 --> 02:07:30,493
that's happened to me
in a long time.

2081
02:07:30,568 --> 02:07:31,500
Really?

2082
02:07:31,569 --> 02:07:32,934
No shit?

2083
02:07:34,572 --> 02:07:36,335
Yes. Here you go,
my friend.

2084
02:07:36,407 --> 02:07:37,965
Sometimes things work.

2085
02:07:38,042 --> 02:07:39,236
Yeah?

2086
02:07:39,310 --> 02:07:40,242
Yeah.

2087
02:07:41,379 --> 02:07:42,505
O.K., then. To 20.

2088
02:07:42,580 --> 02:07:44,070
Take it out
from back there.

2089
02:07:44,148 --> 02:07:45,547
Winner takes it out.

2090
02:07:45,616 --> 02:07:48,847
You're sure? You might
not get a chance to shoot.

2091
02:07:48,920 --> 02:07:50,182
You're going down.

2092
02:07:50,254 --> 02:07:52,722
That is so cool
about you and Jane.

2093
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:54,690
Yeah. That's why
I came tonight.

2094
02:07:54,759 --> 02:07:56,590
I thought of a way
to thank you.

2095
02:07:56,661 --> 02:07:58,219
You don't have to.

2096
02:07:58,296 --> 02:07:59,524
I have an idea.

2097
02:08:04,168 --> 02:08:05,260
If you're up for it,

2098
02:08:05,336 --> 02:08:07,167
there's something
I could do for you.

2099
02:08:07,238 --> 02:08:08,899
You don't have to.
Just play ball.

2100
02:08:08,973 --> 02:08:10,372
That's why I'm here.

2101
02:08:10,441 --> 02:08:13,535
I thought of a way to show
I appreciate you for...

2102
02:08:16,614 --> 02:08:19,174
for introducing me
to Jane.

2103
02:08:28,126 --> 02:08:29,991
End of the line, folks.

2104
02:09:13,471 --> 02:09:15,598
So what do
you think?

2105
02:09:18,109 --> 02:09:21,135
I think...
it's not all bad.
