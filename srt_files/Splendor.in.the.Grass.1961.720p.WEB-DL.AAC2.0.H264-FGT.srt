1
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:54,211
- Bud.
- Deanie, please.

2
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:56,752
Bud, I'm afraid.

3
00:01:58,963 --> 00:02:01,373
Oh, Bud.

4
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,256
- Don't, Bud.
- Deanie.

5
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,100
No. We mustn't, Bud.

6
00:02:11,267 --> 00:02:14,677
No. No.

7
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:27,569
Bud, don't be mad.

8
00:02:31,495 --> 00:02:33,815
I'd better take you home.

9
00:02:57,855 --> 00:03:00,605
We've had enough kissing for tonight.

10
00:04:03,754 --> 00:04:05,174
Deanie.

11
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,829
Has Bud left?

12
00:04:07,008 --> 00:04:09,088
Yes, Mom.

13
00:04:14,765 --> 00:04:17,215
Oh, there's wonderful news tonight.

14
00:04:17,393 --> 00:04:22,733
The Stamper oil stocks-- Drink your milk.
--went up 14 points today.

15
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,278
Think of it, honey.

16
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:29,112
That means if we sold those stocks
we'd make $15,000.

17
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:33,780
Maybe we can even send you away
to college next year.

18
00:04:33,951 --> 00:04:36,281
Well, we're not going to sell.

19
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:39,574
Your father says
that everyone at the Elks says...

20
00:04:39,749 --> 00:04:44,459
...that the stocks are going up
even higher.

21
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:49,211
Mmm.
Didn't Bud say anything about it tonight?

22
00:04:49,383 --> 00:04:52,753
He doesn't know anything
about his father's business, Mom.

23
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,589
Oh. Hmm.

24
00:04:54,764 --> 00:04:57,054
He doesn't care about that.

25
00:04:57,475 --> 00:05:01,635
What were you and Bud doing
all this time, for heaven's sake?

26
00:05:01,937 --> 00:05:04,977
We were studying together.

27
00:05:13,491 --> 00:05:17,281
I'm going to bed, Mom.
I'm awfully tired.

28
00:05:18,162 --> 00:05:19,912
Deanie?

29
00:05:21,374 --> 00:05:22,664
Now, Wilma Dean.

30
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:25,615
Deanie.

31
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:30,916
I wanna talk to you.

32
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:34,962
Now, Wilma Dean, Bud Stamper
could get you into a whole lot of trouble.

33
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:37,677
And you know how I mean.

34
00:05:37,973 --> 00:05:40,893
Boys don't respect a girl
they can go all the way with.

35
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:46,011
Boys want a nice girl for a wife.

36
00:05:49,151 --> 00:05:53,201
Wilma Dean, you and Bud
haven't gone too far already, have you?

37
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:54,994
No, Mother.

38
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,697
Tell me the truth, Wilma Dean.

39
00:05:58,869 --> 00:06:01,789
No, Mom, we haven't gone too far.

40
00:06:05,334 --> 00:06:08,214
That's a relief. That's a relief.

41
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,211
- Mom?
- Mm-hm?

42
00:06:12,383 --> 00:06:16,553
Is it so terrible
to have those feelings about a boy?

43
00:06:16,971 --> 00:06:19,551
No nice girl does.

44
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:24,224
- Doesn't she?
- No. No nice girl.

45
00:06:27,648 --> 00:06:33,818
But, Mom, didn't you ever...?

46
00:06:35,823 --> 00:06:40,373
Well, I mean, didn't you ever
feel that way about Dad?

47
00:06:41,412 --> 00:06:45,582
Your father never laid a hand on me
until we were married.

48
00:06:46,542 --> 00:06:52,832
And then I-- Well, I just
gave in because a wife has to.

49
00:06:53,257 --> 00:06:57,917
A woman doesn't enjoy those things
the way a man does.

50
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:01,879
She just lets her husband...

51
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:08,549
...come near her
in order to have children.

52
00:07:16,864 --> 00:07:19,904
Deanie, what's troubling you?

53
00:07:20,076 --> 00:07:22,196
Oh, nothing, Mom.

54
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:25,236
I'm just tired.

55
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:28,196
I wanna go to bed now.

56
00:07:29,418 --> 00:07:31,498
Now, Deanie...

57
00:07:33,964 --> 00:07:36,974
...you tell Bud Stamper
to bring you home earlier after this...

58
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:39,924
...especially on school nights.

59
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,005
Good night, sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

60
00:07:44,183 --> 00:07:45,813
Night.

61
00:07:47,603 --> 00:07:48,643
My sandwich.

62
00:08:19,051 --> 00:08:22,091
Our Father which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

63
00:08:32,273 --> 00:08:35,363
- Del. Del.
- Huh? Something wrong?

64
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:38,686
Wilma Dean and the Stamper boy
are in love.

65
00:08:38,863 --> 00:08:43,533
- They're in love, I tell you, Del.
- Go back to sleep, Mama.

66
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:46,901
He'd be the catch of a lifetime, Del.

67
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:03,302
Put it right in there.

68
00:09:05,348 --> 00:09:09,348
I hope we bring in a gusher
for you every day, boss.

69
00:09:10,061 --> 00:09:11,561
Take it, that's yours.

70
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:13,969
- Hold it, hold it.
- That's yours, go on, take it.

71
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:17,068
- Boss, Bud's here. Here's Bud, boss.
- Come on in here, my boy.

72
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,244
Bud, your old man's gonna
get us in trouble with our wives.

73
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:22,364
We're gonna go home
smelling like brew...

74
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,491
...and they're gonna wonder
where we got it.

75
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,069
- They're gonna want some too.
- Get something to eat, son.

76
00:09:27,244 --> 00:09:30,414
- I gotta go up to bed.
- Wait a minute, son. I wanna talk to you.

77
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:34,001
You men go on, entertain yourselves.
I wanna have a few words with my boy.

78
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:37,418
Murph, have some more venison.
You don't get meat like that every day.

79
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:40,258
They don't make that home brew
like that anymore, huh?

80
00:09:41,425 --> 00:09:44,755
This is a pretty late hour for a boy
keeping football training, isn't it?

81
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:47,219
Come on here. I wanna talk to you, son.

82
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:52,425
You're the captain of the team, son.
Those other boys look up to you.

83
00:09:52,603 --> 00:09:55,013
You gotta run with the ball.

84
00:09:55,981 --> 00:10:01,901
I wasn't much older than you, Bud,
when I fell off that crown block...

85
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:04,781
...and I hit that rig floor.

86
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:08,828
And my running days was long gone.

87
00:10:09,787 --> 00:10:11,367
So....

88
00:10:12,623 --> 00:10:16,293
So you doing the running
for both of us now, boy.

89
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,790
- I wanted talk to you--
- I brought in a well today.

90
00:10:18,963 --> 00:10:22,463
She's flowing over a hundred barrels
an hour. Our stocks are going way up.

91
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:25,843
Big Eastern companies, they beginning
to sit up and take notice of us.

92
00:10:26,012 --> 00:10:28,722
Them damn people
are really beginning to take notice of us.

93
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:31,299
- You been out with the little Loomis girl?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:33,795
You watching yourself with her now,
ain't you, son?

95
00:10:33,978 --> 00:10:37,728
You not doing anything, boy,
you gonna be ashamed of, are you?

96
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:38,978
No, sir. I--

97
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:42,320
She's a nice kid, son.
She's a good-looker.

98
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:46,566
I've known her folks ever since--
Well, old Del and I were boys together.

99
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:49,281
I got nothing against them, Bud,
because they're poor.

100
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:51,162
I'm not a snob or anything like that.

101
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,119
The only difference between me and Del
is that I got ambition.

102
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:56,000
Ha, ha. Hey, Dad, I--

103
00:10:56,167 --> 00:11:00,167
But if anything was to happen,
you'd have to marry her.

104
00:11:00,338 --> 00:11:04,038
You'd have to marry her, son.
You realize that, don't you?

105
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:07,296
You get a girl in trouble, boy,
and you gotta take the consequences.

106
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,300
- Dad, I'm not--
- Sit down. Well, sit down.

107
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:11,512
- Well, I wanna talk to you about--
- Sit down, Bud.

108
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,430
I wanna talk to you about
some stuff-- -All right, lay it on me.

109
00:11:14,602 --> 00:11:17,522
Come on, lay it on me.
Lay it on me. Attaboy.

110
00:11:17,688 --> 00:11:21,468
There you go. Lay it on me.
Lay it on now. That's great.

111
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:24,360
- Lick like a bear. We got a future, boy.
- Yeah.

112
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:25,858
You and me, we got a future.

113
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,740
The first thing we gonna do,
we gonna get you an education.

114
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:31,528
Four years at Yale.
Can I tell you a secret, Bud?

115
00:11:31,702 --> 00:11:34,192
- I'll tell you a secret, son. Come here.
- What's that?

116
00:11:34,372 --> 00:11:38,212
My company is gonna merge with one
of those big Eastern companies.

117
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:41,246
I'm gonna put you in there.
I'm gonna put you in there, boy.

118
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:45,210
- I'm lining up a future for you, boy.
- I've been thinking about some--

119
00:11:45,383 --> 00:11:49,713
There ain't nothing in this world
that I wouldn't do for you, boy.

120
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:52,047
There's nothing I wouldn't do,
if you do right.

121
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,103
If you do right, Bud.

122
00:11:55,267 --> 00:11:57,887
Now, don't disappoint me, son.

123
00:11:58,229 --> 00:12:00,219
Don't disappoint me, boy.

124
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:04,228
God knows
I've had one disappointment already.

125
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:08,819
- She asleep?
- Yes, finally.

126
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:10,529
- Is sis back?
- Hello, Bud.

127
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,740
Your mother brought her home
from Chicago a little while ago.

128
00:12:13,911 --> 00:12:17,251
- Welcome home, Mom.
- It was a miserable trip, just miserable.

129
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:19,205
How's Deanie?

130
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:21,089
I don't know.

131
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:22,532
I'm gonna go to bed, Dad.

132
00:12:22,712 --> 00:12:25,502
I'm going to bed too,
but I'm afraid I won't sleep a wink.

133
00:12:25,673 --> 00:12:29,923
Yeah, you go to bed, son.
Got a football game to win tomorrow.

134
00:12:30,094 --> 00:12:31,134
Bud?

135
00:12:33,264 --> 00:12:35,514
I got all my hopes
pinned on you now, boy.

136
00:12:43,691 --> 00:12:45,851
How you men getting on in there?

137
00:12:52,783 --> 00:12:55,193
Well, you certainly
spoiled that girl.

138
00:12:55,369 --> 00:12:57,449
First you send her off
to finishing school--

139
00:12:57,621 --> 00:12:59,201
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Bea.

140
00:12:59,373 --> 00:13:01,503
She breaks all the rules
and they kick her out.

141
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:05,877
Then you send her off to university. She
goes hog-wild and flunks all her courses.

142
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:08,877
Then you had to learn your lesson
all over again, didn't you?

143
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,140
Let her go off to art school
in a wild place like Chicago.

144
00:13:12,303 --> 00:13:14,133
She gets tied up with
some cake eater...

145
00:13:14,305 --> 00:13:16,425
...gets her into trouble
just so he can marry her.

146
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:20,889
- But your lawyer got it annulled.
- You're damn right, I got it annulled.

147
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:23,392
When I made it perfectly clear
to Mr. Cake-Eater...

148
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:27,064
...that I was gonna cut off her
allowance, he backed out in a hurry.

149
00:13:27,234 --> 00:13:30,274
Well, she's just
a headstrong little flapper.

150
00:13:30,446 --> 00:13:33,856
But I'm gonna keep her home here
and teach her a little discipline.

151
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,155
Yes, sir.

152
00:13:36,577 --> 00:13:39,947
I'm gonna keep that young lady home,
teach her a little discipline.

153
00:13:40,122 --> 00:13:42,992
If you think I'm going to stay here
in the godforsaken town...

154
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:46,617
...and have people laugh at me and
gossip, you've got another thing coming.

155
00:13:46,796 --> 00:13:48,996
I'll really give them something
to gossip about.

156
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:54,173
- Why, sister, you're up so early.
- I can't sleep in this house.

157
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:58,255
I'm going to California and live
with Aunt Blossom and study art.

158
00:13:58,432 --> 00:13:59,472
Art who?

159
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,650
- Welcome home, Miss Virginia.
- Phoebe.

160
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,560
I hate it here. I'm a freak in this town.

161
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,694
Everybody stares at me
like I was something out of a carnival.

162
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:14,822
Because you peroxide your hair
and paint your face like an Indian.

163
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,650
Morning, everybody.

164
00:14:16,826 --> 00:14:18,196
- Hey, how are you?
- Just great.

165
00:14:18,369 --> 00:14:21,489
He's gonna make me stay home
a whole year just to punish me.

166
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:24,124
There aren't any more schools left
that will have you.

167
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:26,831
Ginny, there's nothing so distasteful
about being at home--

168
00:14:27,003 --> 00:14:29,043
This is the ugliest place
in the whole world.

169
00:14:29,213 --> 00:14:31,423
Everywhere you look,
there's an oil well.

170
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,960
I'll bet you'd drill for a well
in the dining room.

171
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:37,135
Damn right I would, if I thought
there was any oil under there.

172
00:14:37,304 --> 00:14:38,934
I'll see you later.

173
00:14:39,348 --> 00:14:41,718
How do you
want your eggs, Bud darling?

174
00:14:41,892 --> 00:14:44,382
Hey, you come back here
and eat a decent breakfast.

175
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:46,062
You have a good breakfast.

176
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,430
You come on back here, boy.

177
00:14:47,606 --> 00:14:50,726
You can't play a football game
on a breakfast like that.

178
00:14:54,572 --> 00:14:59,282
Oh, dear, neither of my children
gets any real nourishment.

179
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,245
- Hi.
- Hey, want a peach?

180
00:15:12,423 --> 00:15:16,043
What? Don't. Bud, don't.

181
00:15:18,554 --> 00:15:19,594
You.

182
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,139
Hi, Bud. Hi, Deanie.

183
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:25,470
- Hey, Bud.
- Hi.

184
00:15:25,644 --> 00:15:27,474
Hey, Deanie.

185
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,846
Hey, Bud. Bud.

186
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,940
Hi.

187
00:15:40,701 --> 00:15:43,111
- Hi, Deanie.
- Hi.

188
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:49,124
- Hi, Deanie.
- Hello.

189
00:15:49,293 --> 00:15:50,953
Hi, Bud.

190
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:02,806
Hi, Juanita.

191
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,321
Hey.

192
00:16:30,584 --> 00:16:32,834
Wilma Dean,
hereafter I shall count you tardy...

193
00:16:33,004 --> 00:16:35,414
...if you are not in your seat
when the bell rings.

194
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:37,919
I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf.

195
00:16:44,181 --> 00:16:46,671
Alan, please.

196
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:50,183
All right.

197
00:16:51,147 --> 00:16:55,187
Now, for the first few weeks
we have been reading...

198
00:16:55,359 --> 00:16:59,859
...the stories of King Arthur
and the Knights of the Round Table.

199
00:17:00,031 --> 00:17:03,651
Now, the literature of the age
was characterized by...?

200
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:06,526
All right, Alan.

201
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,291
By high ideals.

202
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:17,209
True. And by what else?

203
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:19,541
You going with us to the football game?

204
00:17:19,717 --> 00:17:23,127
- All right, Carolyn?
- They were very religious.

205
00:17:23,304 --> 00:17:25,464
Yes, religion played a very
important part...

206
00:17:25,639 --> 00:17:28,389
...in the lives of the knights
and their fair ladies.

207
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,889
What else?

208
00:17:30,353 --> 00:17:33,023
I'm going,
but I'm waiting for Bud after the game.

209
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:35,679
Oh, we knew that, crazy.

210
00:17:37,902 --> 00:17:39,692
Rusty?

211
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,601
Uh....

212
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,230
The Knights of the Round Table--

213
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,829
- Just because his father's got money--
- That's not true, Kay.

214
00:17:49,288 --> 00:17:53,578
Well, they were very brave
and, uh, things like that.

215
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,751
Bud Stamper isn't
stuck on himself at all.

216
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,660
What do you mean, he isn't stuck on--?

217
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:00,918
Now what in the world do you mean
by "things like that," exactly?

218
00:18:03,678 --> 00:18:05,418
Well, I don't know exactly.

219
00:18:10,184 --> 00:18:12,184
Let us learn to express ourselves...

220
00:18:12,353 --> 00:18:14,353
...with as much precision as possible.

221
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:18,944
Juanita, you had your hand up?

222
00:18:19,485 --> 00:18:22,565
The Knights of the Round Table
had a very high regard for women.

223
00:18:23,114 --> 00:18:24,784
In what way, Juanita?

224
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,530
Well, they looked on women
as very pure.

225
00:18:31,706 --> 00:18:34,026
They wouldn't look on her as very pure.

226
00:18:35,918 --> 00:18:38,618
All right now,
I want it quiet in this classroom.

227
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:42,246
Now, the next time that there is talking
while this class is in session...

228
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:46,285
...I am going to send the culprit
to the principal's office.

229
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,800
Yes, Juanita, you're quite right.

230
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:54,474
The knights did have
a very high regard for womanhood.

231
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:58,095
In fact, they put women on a pedestal.

232
00:18:58,607 --> 00:19:03,237
Some people say
that chivalry is not dead.

233
00:19:03,404 --> 00:19:05,234
Well, how about it, girls?

234
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:08,736
Do any of you feel
that you're on a pedestal?

235
00:19:10,536 --> 00:19:12,196
Well....

236
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:23,245
That's unnecessary roughness.
Fifteen yards.

237
00:19:23,424 --> 00:19:26,094
Aw, come on.
You've been on me all day.

238
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,670
You're out. You're out of the game.

239
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:36,387
Who you taking out
tonight, Toots?

240
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:37,762
Never mind who I'm taking out.

241
00:19:37,897 --> 00:19:41,727
<i>Juanita, Juanita</i>

242
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:45,691
Okay, okay, what's so funny about that?
Juanita's the only girl in school...

243
00:19:45,863 --> 00:19:48,533
- ...who knows what it's all about.
- You can say that again.

244
00:19:48,699 --> 00:19:50,939
I'll never look twice at those other girls.

245
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:52,445
Spend good money on them...

246
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:55,790
...and they expect you to feel satisfied
if they even kiss you good night.

247
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:08,379
- Hi, Bud.
- Hi, Juanita.

248
00:20:08,552 --> 00:20:10,212
Say, did you see Toots in there?

249
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:12,598
Uh, yeah, yeah. He should be right out.

250
00:20:12,765 --> 00:20:15,425
Gee, you played a wonderful game, Bud.

251
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,063
Thank you.

252
00:20:25,403 --> 00:20:27,733
Uh, he should be right out.

253
00:20:33,577 --> 00:20:35,367
Hi, sweetheart.

254
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:39,294
I suppose you wish I were
more like Juanita Howard, don't you?

255
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:40,998
What?

256
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:46,617
I saw the way you were looking at her.
I think she's disgraceful.

257
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,549
The way she stands there
waiting for one of the players.

258
00:20:49,719 --> 00:20:50,799
Wait a minute.

259
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,470
There isn't any reason in the world
why I shouldn't speak to her.

260
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,390
You were more than speaking to her.

261
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,059
You think I'm supposed to not notice
her? Is that what you expect out of me?

262
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:03,679
I'm not even supposed to know
girls like that exist, huh?

263
00:21:04,191 --> 00:21:06,431
- Bud, I'm sorry.
- Ahh.

264
00:21:06,694 --> 00:21:09,734
- I'm sorry, Bud, honest.
- All right. You're sorry.

265
00:21:15,661 --> 00:21:18,501
Mr. Loomis, a customer for meat.

266
00:21:20,624 --> 00:21:23,634
Oh, Bud. Bud, please don't be mad.

267
00:21:24,128 --> 00:21:27,128
- I'm not mad, Deanie.
- Hi, Bud. Deanie.

268
00:21:27,298 --> 00:21:29,338
- Hi, Mr. Loomis.
- Hi, Dad.

269
00:21:31,093 --> 00:21:32,133
Bud.

270
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:35,803
Bud, I just can't stand it
when you're mad at me.

271
00:21:35,973 --> 00:21:40,443
Aw, Deanie, I don't know
what's the matter with me lately.

272
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:43,143
I'm always losing my temper.

273
00:21:45,816 --> 00:21:48,686
You're the only girl in the world for me,
don't you know that?

274
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:50,611
I wanna be.

275
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,240
And if it weren't for you....

276
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:57,320
If it weren't for you, Deanie, I'd....

277
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:00,319
I don't know, I--

278
00:22:18,015 --> 00:22:19,175
- Oh, Bud.
- What?

279
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,760
Bud, it's broad daylight.

280
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:23,845
- Who cares?
- Stop it. Stop it.

281
00:22:25,523 --> 00:22:28,693
Bud. Come on now.
Bud, people can see us.

282
00:22:28,859 --> 00:22:31,479
- I don't care.
- Stop it, Bud, stop it.

283
00:22:31,654 --> 00:22:33,694
Come on, now.

284
00:22:35,825 --> 00:22:37,615
Mom?

285
00:22:37,868 --> 00:22:40,108
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

286
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:44,327
Mom?

287
00:22:45,459 --> 00:22:46,709
Is she not here?

288
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:48,537
- Mom?
- Mom?

289
00:22:48,713 --> 00:22:49,883
- Stop it.
- Nobody's here.

290
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:51,877
Come on now, Bud, now, stop that.

291
00:22:53,551 --> 00:22:55,711
Mom.

292
00:22:58,014 --> 00:22:59,924
Mom?

293
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,061
Yes, Mrs. Harper,
here's your change.

294
00:23:05,229 --> 00:23:06,259
Bud, now, stop it.

295
00:23:06,439 --> 00:23:07,769
- Why?
- I have to pull down...

296
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,440
...the shade to the store.

297
00:23:14,447 --> 00:23:17,367
- Mrs. Loomis, are you--?
- Stop it.

298
00:23:22,246 --> 00:23:24,486
You're nuts about me, aren't you?

299
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:29,878
You're nuts about me.

300
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:38,751
I've got your 10-pound sack
in the back of the store, Mrs. Thatcher.

301
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,063
No, Bud.

302
00:23:55,321 --> 00:23:56,521
Bud?

303
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:58,767
- At my feet, slave.
- Bud, don't.

304
00:23:58,949 --> 00:24:00,819
- Now tell me you love me.
- You're hurting me.

305
00:24:00,993 --> 00:24:02,653
Tell me you can't live without me.

306
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:03,858
- Say it.
- I do.

307
00:24:04,038 --> 00:24:05,278
- You do what?
- I do love you.

308
00:24:05,456 --> 00:24:08,616
And you can't live without me.
You'd be everything I ever ask you to be.

309
00:24:08,793 --> 00:24:11,463
I'd do anything for you.

310
00:24:17,134 --> 00:24:19,634
Deanie, I didn't mean to hurt you.

311
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:25,471
Deanie.

312
00:24:28,104 --> 00:24:30,984
Deanie. Deanie, I was just kidding.

313
00:24:31,565 --> 00:24:35,395
Look, I'm the one. I should go down
on my knees to you, Deanie.

314
00:24:35,653 --> 00:24:39,153
Deanie, I was just kidding.
I thought you knew that.

315
00:24:41,784 --> 00:24:44,244
I can't kid about these things.

316
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:47,369
Because I am nuts about you.

317
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,700
And I would go down on my knees to
worship you if you really wanted me to.

318
00:24:52,837 --> 00:24:55,667
Bud, I can't get along without you.

319
00:24:57,008 --> 00:25:02,168
And I would do anything
you'd ask me to. I would.

320
00:25:03,764 --> 00:25:05,514
I would.

321
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:07,675
Anything.

322
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:13,140
Oh, Bud.

323
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:16,349
Bud.

324
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:19,530
Bud.

325
00:25:29,665 --> 00:25:33,035
- Let's speak up at the next meeting.
- I certainly will if you will.

326
00:25:33,794 --> 00:25:35,544
I'm going to go in and fix supper now.

327
00:25:35,713 --> 00:25:38,723
- Bye-bye, Nell.
- Bye, Frieda.

328
00:25:41,886 --> 00:25:43,546
Bud.

329
00:25:56,108 --> 00:25:57,138
Hi, Mom.

330
00:26:06,994 --> 00:26:09,204
The coast is clear.

331
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,996
Are we going to the victory dance?

332
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:22,010
I can think of things I'd rather do.

333
00:26:30,601 --> 00:26:32,511
I'll be ready.

334
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,937
Okay, I'll pick you up
right after dinner then.

335
00:26:50,538 --> 00:26:53,658
- Did he tell you about his sister, Ginny?
- No.

336
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:58,753
Well, Ginny Stamper is too low
for the dogs to bite. Come here.

337
00:26:59,213 --> 00:27:04,173
She met some man in Chicago,
put her in the family way.

338
00:27:04,343 --> 00:27:08,343
Mrs. Stamper had to go out there
and get her, take her to a doctor--

339
00:27:08,514 --> 00:27:10,804
Store's all locked up.

340
00:27:12,977 --> 00:27:14,517
Good.

341
00:27:15,396 --> 00:27:18,266
--to have one of those
awful operations performed.

342
00:27:19,483 --> 00:27:20,983
Oh, Mom, that's gossip.

343
00:27:21,819 --> 00:27:23,899
Every word is true.

344
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:26,741
I was at the DAR this afternoon
and heard all about it.

345
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:29,577
Mrs. Whitcomb lives
across the street from the Stampers...

346
00:27:29,744 --> 00:27:33,454
...and she knows everything
that goes on in their house.

347
00:27:33,622 --> 00:27:38,872
That's what happens to girls
who go wild and boy-crazy.

348
00:27:53,851 --> 00:27:56,691
Well, congratulations, son.

349
00:27:56,854 --> 00:27:59,564
- Congratulations, son.
- Good game, boy, the game.

350
00:27:59,732 --> 00:28:01,392
Thank you.

351
00:28:03,277 --> 00:28:07,187
Well, I'll, uh, run along upstairs and....

352
00:28:09,116 --> 00:28:10,146
Dad.

353
00:28:11,827 --> 00:28:14,527
Dad, I wanna have a talk with you.

354
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:18,831
I've had just about all the nonsense
I intend to take out of you, girl.

355
00:28:24,674 --> 00:28:28,544
Now, you get out of here, young lady.
I'm gonna have a talk with my boy.

356
00:28:35,851 --> 00:28:37,681
All right, son.

357
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,860
All right. Go ahead.

358
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,610
- Dad, I'm gonna marry Deanie.
- Whoa, now, son.

359
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:47,898
Now, listen, Dad.

360
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:52,572
You see, I don't really wanna go to Yale.
I'm not a very good student.

361
00:28:52,743 --> 00:28:55,203
What do you mean
you're not a good student?

362
00:28:55,371 --> 00:28:56,401
Wait a minute--

363
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,570
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

364
00:28:58,749 --> 00:29:03,579
But, Dad, I'd like to go away to a good
agricultural college for a couple of years.

365
00:29:03,754 --> 00:29:06,714
I'd really like to do that, Dad.
I could come back here...

366
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:09,132
...and I could take over your ranch
south of town.

367
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:11,711
- Ranching is no kind of life.
- I could marry Deanie.

368
00:29:11,887 --> 00:29:14,927
I could take her off to college with me.
That's what I really want.

369
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:16,589
She'd be a big help to me, Dad.

370
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:18,887
I spent my whole life
trying to create...

371
00:29:19,061 --> 00:29:21,301
...a place of importance
for you in this world.

372
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,940
Then you come home and tell me
you don't wanna go to college.

373
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:28,058
- You wanna marry some little girl.
- Dad, it's what I want that counts.

374
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,120
Son, a boy your age
doesn't even know what he wants.

375
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:35,453
After you've had a college education,
then you might change your mind.

376
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:37,609
A college education
will take me four years.

377
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:39,448
- Trust me.
- I do trust you, but I--

378
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,753
- Trust me this time, son.
- I trust you, Dad.

379
00:29:41,917 --> 00:29:47,127
- I do trust you. But four years of wait--
- Bud, listen to me, now.

380
00:29:47,298 --> 00:29:48,538
But, Dad.

381
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:52,223
Son, all I'm asking you to do
is to finish Yale.

382
00:29:52,386 --> 00:29:55,256
Then if you still wanna marry
the little Loomis girl...

383
00:29:55,431 --> 00:29:58,101
...you come back here
and you marry her, with my blessing.

384
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,507
I'll send you both off to Europe
for a honeymoon.

385
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:05,726
- Bud, please wait. Son.
- I just don't know if I can, Dad.

386
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,410
I feel like I'm going nuts sometimes.

387
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:15,073
I understand that.

388
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:18,986
Your old man understands, son.

389
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:27,748
What you need for the time being, Bud,
is a different kind of girl.

390
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:32,502
When I was a boy, son,
there was always two kinds of girls.

391
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:37,087
And us boys, we'd never even
mention them in the same breath...

392
00:30:37,264 --> 00:30:42,774
...but every now and then, one of us
boys would sneak off with a girl.

393
00:30:43,604 --> 00:30:46,894
And we'd get a little steam
out of our system.

394
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:48,476
Dad....

395
00:30:49,568 --> 00:30:55,068
- No girl looks good to me except Deanie.
- Well, I know, son. I know.

396
00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,500
- I love her, Dad.
- I know, son. I know.

397
00:31:02,123 --> 00:31:04,993
- See, I don't wanna do that.
- I know.

398
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:23,005
Okay, I'll go to Yale.

399
00:31:23,185 --> 00:31:26,305
But I want you know that
I'm gonna marry her a soon as I get out.

400
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,600
It's a promise.

401
00:31:27,773 --> 00:31:30,183
- Well, I want you to remember that.
- It's a promise.

402
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,609
- It's a promise, son.
- Okay.

403
00:31:31,777 --> 00:31:34,067
I'm gonna send you both
off to Europe on a honeymoon.

404
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:36,318
- It's a promise, my boy.
- Okay.

405
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:48,237
Bud, I'll wait for you.
I'll wait for you forever.

406
00:31:49,503 --> 00:31:52,263
I'll do anything you want, Bud.

407
00:32:00,014 --> 00:32:02,684
Yes, it's a time
of great prosperity for us all...

408
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:05,260
...and we must give thanks.

409
00:32:06,312 --> 00:32:10,732
But let us not forget
Christ's warning to the multitude.

410
00:32:11,442 --> 00:32:15,772
Lay not up treasures
for yourself on earth...

411
00:32:15,946 --> 00:32:19,356
...where moth and rust doth corrupt...

412
00:32:19,533 --> 00:32:23,323
...and where thieves
do break through and steal.

413
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:27,276
But lay up for yourself
treasures in heaven...

414
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:31,038
...where neither moth
nor rust doth corrupt...

415
00:32:31,212 --> 00:32:35,212
...and where thieves
do not break through and steal.

416
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:38,472
For where your treasure is...

417
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:41,806
...there will your heart be also.

418
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:49,595
Fine sermon. Fine sermon.

419
00:32:50,147 --> 00:32:53,227
Let us pray.

420
00:33:00,157 --> 00:33:02,647
Take my advice, Del,
hang on to those stocks of yours.

421
00:33:02,827 --> 00:33:05,747
As the comedian on the radio says,
"You ain't seen nothing yet."

422
00:33:05,913 --> 00:33:07,623
We're hanging on, Ace.
We're hanging on.

423
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:10,280
Fine sermon, Reverend.
Fine sermon.

424
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,328
Wonderful passage.

425
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:24,098
Don't you light that cigarette
in front of all these church people.

426
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,585
Do you want me to be a hypocrite?

427
00:33:30,396 --> 00:33:32,956
Alice, who'd have thought that one day
our kids would be, well...

428
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:34,137
...engaged, sort of?

429
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:37,766
I'm mighty proud
of my son's choice, Frieda.

430
00:33:37,945 --> 00:33:40,775
I'm mighty proud of your boy too.

431
00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:43,939
- Excuse us.
- I'll see you at dinner tonight.

432
00:33:44,118 --> 00:33:46,818
- Don't forget, huh?
- All right.

433
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,080
Dad, I'm no spy.

434
00:33:56,255 --> 00:34:00,205
Bud, all I'm asking you to do is keep
an eye on her while I'm in New York.

435
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:04,514
She likes you, son. She won't do
anything crazy when you're around.

436
00:34:06,432 --> 00:34:08,012
Virginia.

437
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:12,562
Why, Virginia.

438
00:34:14,357 --> 00:34:15,437
Ow.

439
00:34:15,608 --> 00:34:18,728
Virginia, I told you,
your father has the key to that cabinet.

440
00:34:18,903 --> 00:34:22,073
- And he's on the train to New York.
- That's him all over.

441
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,649
He keeps the cabinet locked...

442
00:34:23,824 --> 00:34:26,074
...because he doesn't think
anybody should drink but him.

443
00:34:26,243 --> 00:34:28,283
You may be shocking Glenn.

444
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:31,954
Virginia, after all,
we do have Prohibition, you know.

445
00:34:32,124 --> 00:34:34,124
Maybe Glenn doesn't
approve of drinking.

446
00:34:34,293 --> 00:34:37,053
Quick, Henry, the Flit.

447
00:34:38,214 --> 00:34:40,924
Glenn, has your family
lived long in town?

448
00:34:43,177 --> 00:34:46,427
- Um....
- They just moved here from Oklahoma.

449
00:34:46,597 --> 00:34:49,347
Oh, I see.

450
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:54,100
Is your father engaged
in some business in town?

451
00:34:56,565 --> 00:34:59,055
- Um....
- His father is looking for work...

452
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:02,765
...and Glenn works at the filling station
on the corner of Sycamore and Main.

453
00:35:02,947 --> 00:35:04,857
Is there anything else
you'd like to know?

454
00:35:05,032 --> 00:35:07,902
Ginny, I see no reason at all
for your bad nature.

455
00:35:09,453 --> 00:35:11,613
Bud, you're not eating a thing.

456
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:14,119
I'm bored. Come on, let's go.

457
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:16,911
Ginny, there's a lovely dessert coming.

458
00:35:17,086 --> 00:35:22,206
I don't want a lovely dessert. Glenn
and I are going for a ride. Come on.

459
00:35:22,383 --> 00:35:26,093
- Virginia.
- Deanie and I will go with you and Glenn.

460
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:28,092
Bud.

461
00:35:35,604 --> 00:35:36,644
Wake up.

462
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:40,774
Hey, Buddy boy, you're a Boy Scout,
run in and build us a nice hot fire.

463
00:35:40,943 --> 00:35:42,653
My hair's a mess.

464
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,860
- Where?
- Here.

465
00:35:46,532 --> 00:35:49,402
Glenn. Don't, Glenn.

466
00:35:49,577 --> 00:35:51,987
Glenn, stop it. Stop it.

467
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:55,317
<i>Everybody's wild about Mabel</i>

468
00:35:55,499 --> 00:35:57,659
<i>She's the talk of the town</i>

469
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:02,245
<i>Mabel's willing and able
To show a guy around</i>

470
00:36:02,423 --> 00:36:07,803
<i>She's a tease, she's a flirt
You better watch out or you'll get hurt</i>

471
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:13,809
Oh, good, Buddy boy.
Now, how about a drink, hmm?

472
00:36:13,976 --> 00:36:16,756
Oh, I forgot, Buddy boy's in training.

473
00:36:16,937 --> 00:36:19,637
What about you, Deanie girl,
you want a drink, hmm?

474
00:36:20,358 --> 00:36:24,858
Come on, Deanie.
Come on, have a little drink. Come on.

475
00:36:25,029 --> 00:36:27,189
Or is Deanie girl in training too, huh?

476
00:36:27,656 --> 00:36:28,686
Lay off, Ginny.

477
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,080
Oh, why don't you relax? You're just
standing around like a chaperon.

478
00:36:34,246 --> 00:36:38,026
Is that what you came out here for,
just to chaperon Glenn and me?

479
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:42,550
Ain't he pretty, Deanie, huh?

480
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:46,671
My handsome filling-station attendant.

481
00:36:46,842 --> 00:36:50,052
Fill me up, please. I'm empty.

482
00:36:54,058 --> 00:36:57,178
- Come on, honey, let's go for a walk.
- All right.

483
00:36:57,353 --> 00:36:59,813
Yeah, why don't you go
for a walk upstairs?

484
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,010
Ginny.

485
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:04,810
Why don't you quit trying to
pretend you're so pure and righteous?

486
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:06,185
If you weren't my sister--

487
00:37:06,362 --> 00:37:09,402
If I weren't your sister,
you wouldn't do anything.

488
00:37:09,573 --> 00:37:12,033
You never do anything
except what Dad tells you.

489
00:37:12,201 --> 00:37:13,401
Isn't that right, Deanie?

490
00:37:13,577 --> 00:37:15,987
You've been finding that out,
haven't you?

491
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:19,533
He just lets things torment him inside
and make him miserable...

492
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:21,999
...and he never does
anything about them.

493
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:24,329
He never does anything.

494
00:37:24,964 --> 00:37:26,924
Bye.

495
00:37:38,602 --> 00:37:42,732
All this is gonna be ours someday.

496
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:52,067
Why, it's the most wonderful
Christmas I've ever had.

497
00:37:52,241 --> 00:37:55,611
Oh, isn't it beautiful? It's the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen.

498
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:57,116
I wonder what Bud paid for it.

499
00:37:57,288 --> 00:38:00,788
Oh, Mom. I don't see why you always
have to think about what things cost.

500
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:03,908
If you wanna know the truth,
I wish it cost a lot less and was a ring.

501
00:38:04,086 --> 00:38:06,036
- Don't, Mom.
- Four years, you're gonna be--

502
00:38:06,213 --> 00:38:09,633
Oh, all right, all right.

503
00:38:10,134 --> 00:38:14,354
I just wish that Bud Stamper
had a little more gumption.

504
00:38:15,056 --> 00:38:17,006
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

505
00:38:18,476 --> 00:38:23,266
Still. Still. One, two. There.

506
00:38:23,439 --> 00:38:24,469
Thank you for everything.

507
00:38:24,648 --> 00:38:26,028
And one more, please.

508
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:29,152
I still don't see why
I couldn't have had a car.

509
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,730
Why should I buy you a car?
You've got your mother's coupé.

510
00:38:31,906 --> 00:38:32,936
That coupé is a wreck.

511
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:34,735
What have you done
with your hair?

512
00:38:34,909 --> 00:38:37,659
- I just put a henna rinse.
- You look like a circus clown.

513
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:39,988
Still. Still.

514
00:38:41,374 --> 00:38:42,414
I'll get it.

515
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:46,503
One, two. There.

516
00:38:46,796 --> 00:38:48,286
Thank God that's over.

517
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,002
- Hi, Ginny.
- Oh, Brian.

518
00:38:53,177 --> 00:38:55,667
My parents are in there.

519
00:38:56,681 --> 00:38:58,811
Oh, Brian.

520
00:38:58,974 --> 00:39:00,174
- Perfume?
- Arpege.

521
00:39:00,351 --> 00:39:02,841
It's my favorite kind.
I just have to slip on my dress.

522
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,600
Come meet the folks. Come on.

523
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:10,994
They're kind of dull, but you can
stand them for a few minutes.

524
00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:13,609
Go on.

525
00:39:16,867 --> 00:39:20,037
- Hello, I'm Ace Stamper.
- I'm Brian Stacey.

526
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:22,494
- What can I do for you?
- I'm just waiting for Ginny.

527
00:39:22,665 --> 00:39:25,865
She may take forever.
Come on in. This is my son, Bud.

528
00:39:26,043 --> 00:39:27,873
Come here, son.

529
00:39:28,045 --> 00:39:30,665
Boy is captain of the football team.
You heard about him?

530
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,480
- Well, I don't get to many games.
- Yeah?

531
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:34,180
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

532
00:39:34,343 --> 00:39:36,673
This is my wife, Mrs. Stamper.

533
00:39:36,887 --> 00:39:39,377
Oh, won't you come in?

534
00:39:40,016 --> 00:39:44,346
<i>She's a tease, she's a flirt
You'd better watch out or you'll get hurt</i>

535
00:40:01,662 --> 00:40:03,242
- Ginny.
- Oh!

536
00:40:05,583 --> 00:40:09,283
- Ginny, I wanna talk to you.
- Well, come on in.

537
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:13,704
<i>Everybody's wild about Mabel
She's the talk of the town</i>

538
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:18,213
<i>Mabel's willing and able
To show a guy around</i>

539
00:40:18,387 --> 00:40:23,467
Ginny, I know who that guy is.
Ginny. That guy's a bootlegger.

540
00:40:23,642 --> 00:40:26,432
Is he? Here, do me up.

541
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,978
Do you know he's a married man?

542
00:40:29,148 --> 00:40:32,228
How do you know so much about him,
sweetie pie?

543
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:34,441
- You're not going out with him.
- Is that so?

544
00:40:34,612 --> 00:40:36,862
- I'd like to see you stop me.
- This is Christmas.

545
00:40:37,031 --> 00:40:39,611
You're gonna stay home
and be decent to your mother.

546
00:40:39,784 --> 00:40:42,794
- Get out of my way. Get out of my way.
- You're not leaving here.

547
00:40:51,796 --> 00:40:54,416
Bro-- Buddy.

548
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:57,793
Buddy.

549
00:41:04,392 --> 00:41:07,642
If you wanna listen to Dad, go ahead.

550
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:11,566
One of these days, you'll find out.

551
00:41:14,902 --> 00:41:17,942
You'll find out, and then God help you.

552
00:41:20,074 --> 00:41:23,664
All right, calm down, everybody.
Come on now, just calm down.

553
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:27,108
All right, boys, give me a fanfare.
Give me a fanfare.

554
00:41:27,289 --> 00:41:29,249
Hey, you people, shut up in there.

555
00:41:29,417 --> 00:41:31,787
Give me some gin, baby.

556
00:41:32,962 --> 00:41:35,422
All right, crowd around here.
Crowd around, everybody.

557
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:38,129
Bring this old New Year in right.

558
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:46,684
- This is for Joe.
- Oh, boy.

559
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:51,808
Come on in here.
Bring in the New Year. Come on in here.

560
00:41:58,362 --> 00:42:01,362
Three, two, one. Happy New Year!

561
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,560
Yeah, Smokey. You look lovely, boy.

562
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,220
You're the prettiest baby here.

563
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:49,160
Shake that jelly. Hey, Daddy, Daddy.

564
00:42:49,330 --> 00:42:51,790
Shake it, Daddy. Happy New Year.

565
00:42:51,957 --> 00:42:54,747
Shake that jelly. Shake it, shake it.

566
00:42:54,919 --> 00:42:59,669
Daddy, look at us. Daddy, look.

567
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,090
Come on, move aside.
Come on here, let me through there.

568
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:07,470
Hey there, Smokey boy,
let me ring your doorbell.

569
00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:11,559
Happy New Year, Daddy.

570
00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:14,439
Cut that out. You cut that out.

571
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:19,595
You behave yourself.
You behave yourself, you hear me?

572
00:43:20,528 --> 00:43:22,768
Mr. Stamper,
the perfume is coming.

573
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:25,067
Yeah, yeah, perfume for all the ladies.

574
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:28,281
Line up, ladies, line up.
Get your perfume.

575
00:43:28,786 --> 00:43:32,996
Come on, come on.
Get your perfume, all you ladies.

576
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:34,655
Hey.

577
00:43:35,334 --> 00:43:37,794
Go on, you get in line too.
There's some for you too.

578
00:43:37,962 --> 00:43:39,922
It's gonna be a great year for both of us.

579
00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:47,760
- Dance with me, Dick.
- No thanks, Ginny.

580
00:43:49,682 --> 00:43:51,392
Forget it.

581
00:43:54,562 --> 00:43:56,812
Boy, oh, boy,
she's really plastered.

582
00:43:56,981 --> 00:43:58,641
Hello, Bill.

583
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:02,151
She's disgraceful.

584
00:44:03,446 --> 00:44:05,156
Well, it's all she can do to walk.

585
00:44:05,322 --> 00:44:07,232
Why doesn't her father do something?

586
00:44:07,408 --> 00:44:09,028
- What did she do?
- Hey.

587
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:11,491
Charley, will you dance with me?

588
00:44:11,662 --> 00:44:14,242
Um, not right now, Ginny.

589
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:17,583
Oh, I didn't know you were married.

590
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:34,511
- Hey, look out.
- Hey.

591
00:44:34,685 --> 00:44:38,345
Hey, what do you think
you're doing in here? Go outside.

592
00:44:39,273 --> 00:44:41,103
Hey.

593
00:44:50,034 --> 00:44:53,204
Joe. Happy New Year, Joe.

594
00:44:53,996 --> 00:44:57,246
Go get your sister, son.
Take her on home.

595
00:44:59,126 --> 00:45:00,786
- Hey, sis.
- Happy New Year.

596
00:45:00,961 --> 00:45:03,341
Happy New Year. Hey, sis? Sis.

597
00:45:03,506 --> 00:45:05,326
- Happy New Year.
- What's happy about it?

598
00:45:05,508 --> 00:45:08,208
- You wanna dance? Let's go.
- Joe?

599
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:16,057
You don't-- Where are you taking me?

600
00:45:16,936 --> 00:45:20,686
- Where are you taking me?
- Let me just take you home now.

601
00:45:20,856 --> 00:45:24,056
- No. No, I'm not going home.
- Can I do your dress up?

602
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:25,265
- No.
- Come on.

603
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:26,864
You know you're
all unsnapped here.

604
00:45:27,029 --> 00:45:29,779
Go tell him I'm not going home.

605
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:31,689
You don't have to dance with me.

606
00:45:31,867 --> 00:45:33,987
I like to dance with a good-looking girl.

607
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:38,741
Bull. If you weren't my brother,
you wouldn't even come near me.

608
00:45:38,916 --> 00:45:42,576
You wouldn't come near me.
You're a nice boy, you're nice.

609
00:45:42,753 --> 00:45:46,593
I know what you nice boys are like.
I know you only talk to me in the dark.

610
00:45:46,757 --> 00:45:49,837
In the dark.
You talk to me then, don't you?

611
00:45:50,011 --> 00:45:52,631
You talk to me then
in the dark automobiles, don't you?

612
00:45:52,805 --> 00:45:56,665
You talk to me.
You're very familiar then, aren't you?

613
00:45:56,892 --> 00:45:58,222
Get away from me.

614
00:46:09,697 --> 00:46:12,017
Joe.

615
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:15,944
Joe, where have you been?

616
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:19,460
- Come on, Ginny.
- Your mother's watching, Joe.

617
00:46:19,623 --> 00:46:23,243
Joe, Joe, Joe.

618
00:46:24,545 --> 00:46:28,705
- Joe. Where's Joe?
- Here I am.

619
00:46:29,633 --> 00:46:31,633
Joe.

620
00:46:32,094 --> 00:46:33,474
Joe.

621
00:46:34,805 --> 00:46:36,845
<i>Joe.</i>

622
00:46:38,976 --> 00:46:43,386
- Let's go, Joe. Let's go.
- Where?

623
00:46:45,107 --> 00:46:47,807
- Anywhere.
- Let's go.

624
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:52,362
Happy New Year!

625
00:46:54,533 --> 00:46:56,413
Hey, come on.

626
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:25,184
Leave me alone.

627
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:27,596
Leave me alone.

628
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:29,725
I'm dizzy.

629
00:47:33,864 --> 00:47:34,904
No.

630
00:47:37,368 --> 00:47:39,408
Deanie, did you see where Arnold went?

631
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:42,198
- Get stood up, Kay?
- Looks like it.

632
00:47:42,373 --> 00:47:45,583
- Bud, would you be an angel, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

633
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:49,041
- I'll love you for the rest of my life.
- I'll go look for him.

634
00:48:07,857 --> 00:48:09,347
Hey.

635
00:48:11,944 --> 00:48:14,574
Cut it out. It's his sister.

636
00:48:15,114 --> 00:48:17,574
- Now, lay off, Bill.
- Cut it out, I tell you.

637
00:48:17,742 --> 00:48:20,232
- She's his sister.
- He's gone mad.

638
00:48:21,454 --> 00:48:23,784
- Lay low. It wasn't his fault.
- Stop, it hurts.

639
00:48:23,956 --> 00:48:24,986
Stop this fight.

640
00:48:25,166 --> 00:48:27,156
It wasn't his fault. No one's to blame.

641
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:30,424
- Come on.
- She's not worth it.

642
00:48:30,588 --> 00:48:31,918
Let's go.

643
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,580
Well, she was asking for it.

644
00:48:34,759 --> 00:48:36,499
- Come on. That's enough.
- Hit him.

645
00:48:36,677 --> 00:48:38,387
That's enough.

646
00:48:40,014 --> 00:48:42,094
Watch out, the car.

647
00:48:52,818 --> 00:48:54,198
Stop it, stop it.

648
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:57,452
Charlie, Charlie, come on.

649
00:48:57,615 --> 00:49:00,525
Come on, Charlie.
Come on, let's get out of here.

650
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:03,821
All right, all right. Come on, you--

651
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:08,736
- Come on.
- Bud?

652
00:49:09,502 --> 00:49:11,082
Bud.

653
00:49:11,253 --> 00:49:12,803
Bud.

654
00:49:20,179 --> 00:49:24,259
Bud? Come on inside a minute, okay?

655
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:36,395
Bud?

656
00:49:41,325 --> 00:49:42,515
Bud?

657
00:49:42,702 --> 00:49:44,412
Do you wanna come
inside for a minute?

658
00:49:44,578 --> 00:49:48,578
No. We've gotta stop all this kissing
and fooling around, Deanie.

659
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:51,619
Bud, tell me what's happened.

660
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:55,254
I just don't think that
we better see each other for a while.

661
00:49:57,258 --> 00:49:58,878
But....

662
00:49:59,677 --> 00:50:03,807
- Bud.
- I have to go. Goodbye.

663
00:50:13,315 --> 00:50:16,515
We planned this play around you.
You're to be there when the ball is.

664
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:18,114
- What's the matter?
- I'm sorry.

665
00:50:18,279 --> 00:50:20,819
- Sorry, my foot. You keep training?
- Yes, sir.

666
00:50:20,990 --> 00:50:22,820
- Hours? Diet?
- Yes.

667
00:50:22,992 --> 00:50:27,452
All right, let's try it again.
I said, let's try it again.

668
00:50:29,206 --> 00:50:31,956
I want very much to say this.

669
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:37,246
I wanna give most of you
a high compliment on your term paper.

670
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:40,835
They're the best set of papers
I've ever received.

671
00:50:43,721 --> 00:50:45,801
Thank you so much.

672
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:51,232
- So I want to say--
- Wait for me!

673
00:50:52,021 --> 00:50:53,481
Isn't this wonderful?

674
00:50:53,647 --> 00:50:56,517
- What did you get?
- An A, what do you think?

675
00:50:56,692 --> 00:50:58,102
Bud.

676
00:50:58,986 --> 00:51:01,476
Bud, just a minute.

677
00:51:01,655 --> 00:51:04,405
- I got an A.
- We both got A's.

678
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:06,115
Bud.

679
00:51:07,995 --> 00:51:10,565
Bud, there's something
I've got to tell you.

680
00:51:10,748 --> 00:51:16,118
- Your term paper was not very good.
- Ha. Well, I guess so.

681
00:51:16,295 --> 00:51:18,415
Just remember
you've got to do much better...

682
00:51:18,589 --> 00:51:22,009
...if you're going to get into Yale
in the fall.

683
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:30,051
- Bud.
- Hi.

684
00:51:30,935 --> 00:51:33,085
I miss you, Bud.

685
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:39,455
I just wanted to wish you luck
on the game.

686
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:42,450
Oh. Uh, thanks.

687
00:51:49,078 --> 00:51:50,108
Come on, Bud.

688
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:16,730
Dr. Smiley.

689
00:52:25,823 --> 00:52:27,073
- Doc?
- Yes, Bud.

690
00:52:27,241 --> 00:52:28,621
- What happened?
- You tell me.

691
00:52:28,784 --> 00:52:31,114
- Coach?
- What do you want?

692
00:52:31,287 --> 00:52:32,827
- What is it?
- What's the matter?

693
00:52:32,997 --> 00:52:34,407
He just had a fall.

694
00:52:34,582 --> 00:52:37,042
- Coach. Coach--
- A hundred and four.

695
00:52:37,209 --> 00:52:40,249
I'm gonna recommend the hospital.
There's a lot of pneumonia around.

696
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:42,131
- Pneumonia?
- My God.

697
00:52:46,677 --> 00:52:48,797
Yes, I know.

698
00:52:55,019 --> 00:52:56,509
Doc?

699
00:52:57,188 --> 00:53:00,638
Look, I signed my name to this check.

700
00:53:00,816 --> 00:53:03,516
You pulled my boy through
and I wanted to give you a bonus.

701
00:53:03,694 --> 00:53:05,854
You just fill out the amount.
Five thousand, 10,000--

702
00:53:06,030 --> 00:53:08,150
I'm doing everything
that can be done, Ace.

703
00:53:08,324 --> 00:53:12,164
- Fill out the amount, doc.
- The boy is going to be all right.

704
00:53:12,328 --> 00:53:15,198
- But if he isn't--
- What do you mean, if he isn't?

705
00:53:15,373 --> 00:53:19,923
Ace, I'm not a very religious man,
but I know what every doctor knows.

706
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:22,326
You can't, uh....

707
00:53:22,505 --> 00:53:25,335
You can't reckon with the will of God.

708
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:30,755
Just say whatever is in your heart,
Wilma Dean.

709
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:35,760
All I can think of is, "Dear God,
make him well, make him well."

710
00:53:35,935 --> 00:53:38,175
Then that's your prayer.

711
00:53:38,896 --> 00:53:42,556
But aren't there some words I should say
out of the Bible?

712
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:46,604
I can't think of any
that'd be better than your own.

713
00:54:03,921 --> 00:54:08,421
Oh, please, God, make him well.

714
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,500
Make him well.

715
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,280
Well, Bud, another week or so,
you'll be feeling yourself again.

716
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:31,487
Then spring will be here.

717
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:36,117
You know what happens to a
young man's fancy in the springtime.

718
00:54:38,956 --> 00:54:41,576
- You go with Del Loomis' girl, don't you?
- Yeah.

719
00:54:42,543 --> 00:54:43,713
Mighty attractive girl.

720
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,880
She sure is.

721
00:54:48,758 --> 00:54:50,378
- Doc.
- Yes.

722
00:54:50,801 --> 00:54:54,341
- I'm pretty nuts about Deanie Loomis.
- Oh, I don't blame you.

723
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:56,553
I mean, I love her.

724
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,513
And she loves me.

725
00:55:02,104 --> 00:55:05,614
But it's no fun to be in love.
I mean, it hurts.

726
00:55:06,317 --> 00:55:09,727
Every time that we're together...

727
00:55:10,738 --> 00:55:16,078
...I have to, uh, remember things.
You know what I mean?

728
00:55:16,243 --> 00:55:17,533
Oh, yes.

729
00:55:17,703 --> 00:55:22,503
And I just can't go back
to, uh, seeing her again.

730
00:55:22,833 --> 00:55:26,783
Not like the way we were doing.
We'd go out every night...

731
00:55:28,172 --> 00:55:32,552
...and I'd hold her and I'd kiss her.

732
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:35,835
And I'd just go home.

733
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:41,758
- I mean, a guy can go nuts that way.
- Ha, ha. Well, uh....

734
00:55:42,812 --> 00:55:47,022
I don't know how to advise you, Bud.

735
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:52,355
Well....

736
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:56,515
My dad said...

737
00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:00,939
...that I should get another kind of a girl.

738
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:04,462
Oh, ha, ha, no. No.

739
00:56:05,793 --> 00:56:09,413
But when you don't really want
another girl....

740
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:11,458
No.

741
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:15,681
I don't know.

742
00:56:17,638 --> 00:56:20,388
Well, come in again Friday, Bud.

743
00:56:20,558 --> 00:56:24,508
I'll give you another shot of iron
and another sun-lamp treatment, hmm?

744
00:56:30,818 --> 00:56:32,858
Okay, doc.

745
00:56:33,738 --> 00:56:35,398
So long.

746
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:29,793
- Hi, Deanie.
- Hi, Toots.

747
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:32,040
And that was
the surest way to lose him.

748
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:33,543
What did you say?

749
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:35,424
- He's an animal.
- He is not.

750
00:57:35,591 --> 00:57:37,221
- He is too.
- Yes, I met him.

751
00:57:37,385 --> 00:57:39,125
- You don't know him.
- Who?

752
00:57:39,303 --> 00:57:41,463
One, two, three.

753
00:57:48,562 --> 00:57:49,892
- You're out.
- Am not.

754
00:57:50,064 --> 00:57:51,104
Oh, yes, you are.

755
00:57:51,273 --> 00:57:53,733
- I hurt my finger.
- Kiss it and make it better.

756
00:57:53,901 --> 00:57:55,361
- Hi.
- Hi, Deanie.

757
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:02,186
- Morning.
- Morning.

758
00:58:31,147 --> 00:58:34,647
<i>What though the radiance
Which was once so bright</i>

759
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:37,944
<i>Is now forever taken from my sight</i>

760
00:58:38,988 --> 00:58:40,728
<i>Though nothing can bring back the hour</i>

761
00:58:40,906 --> 00:58:44,776
<i>Of splendor in the grass,
Of glory in the flower</i>

762
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:49,793
<i>We will grieve not, rather find</i>

763
00:58:49,957 --> 00:58:52,657
<i>Strength in what remains behind</i>

764
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:56,303
Now...

765
00:58:57,590 --> 00:59:01,460
...what do you suppose the poet means
by these lines?

766
00:59:11,354 --> 00:59:12,644
Deanie Loomis?

767
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:20,767
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Metcalf, I, uh....

768
00:59:21,572 --> 00:59:22,902
I didn't hear the question.

769
00:59:23,074 --> 00:59:27,164
Well, I know it's spring, Deanie, but
I must ask you to pay more attention.

770
00:59:27,328 --> 00:59:28,818
I'm sorry.

771
00:59:28,996 --> 00:59:30,866
I quoted some lines
from Wordsworth's...

772
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:34,580
..."Ode on Intimations of Immortality,"
Deanie. Did you hear them?

773
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:39,420
I'm afraid not, Miss Metcalf.

774
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:43,720
Well then, I must ask you
to turn your text to Page 380.

775
00:59:54,188 --> 00:59:55,928
Yes.

776
00:59:58,609 --> 01:00:00,569
You read the lines to me.

777
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:02,768
Yes.

778
01:00:05,116 --> 01:00:06,736
Stand, please.

779
01:00:16,961 --> 01:00:19,631
<i>Though nothing can bring back the hour</i>

780
01:00:19,797 --> 01:00:23,457
<i>Of splendor in the grass,
Of glory in the flower</i>

781
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:28,300
<i>We will grieve not, rather find</i>

782
01:00:29,432 --> 01:00:35,142
<i>Strength in what remains behind</i>

783
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:38,852
Perhaps you can tell me exactly what
the poet means by such expressions as:

784
01:00:39,025 --> 01:00:42,475
"Splendor in the grass,"
and "glory in the flower."

785
01:00:47,241 --> 01:00:48,901
Well....

786
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:52,821
I think it has some....

787
01:00:53,331 --> 01:00:54,411
Yes?

788
01:00:59,086 --> 01:01:01,206
Well, when we're young...

789
01:01:01,714 --> 01:01:06,884
...we look at things very idealistically,
I guess.

790
01:01:12,516 --> 01:01:15,516
And I think Wordsworth means...

791
01:01:17,396 --> 01:01:19,136
...that when we grow up...

792
01:01:25,821 --> 01:01:31,531
...that we have to
forget the ideals of youth...

793
01:01:32,244 --> 01:01:34,704
...and find strength.

794
01:01:47,259 --> 01:01:50,929
Miss Metcalf, may I please be ex--?

795
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:07,056
Shh, children!
I'll go see what's the matter.

796
01:02:17,248 --> 01:02:20,168
- Well, hi, June. Hi.
- June, June, I wanna talk to you.

797
01:02:20,876 --> 01:02:22,336
I just gave her a little sedative.

798
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:24,503
- I'm not sick.
- She'll be all right--

799
01:02:24,672 --> 01:02:26,082
Now, Deanie, now lie down.

800
01:02:26,257 --> 01:02:28,927
- I'm all right. Perfectly all right.
- Now, now, now.

801
01:02:29,093 --> 01:02:31,053
- Stop that, now.
- I'm all right.

802
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:34,640
I'm all right.

803
01:02:42,231 --> 01:02:45,681
I don't care if his father is making
my folks rich, I hate Bud Stamper.

804
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,540
You'd take a date with
him if he'd ask you.

805
01:02:47,695 --> 01:02:48,725
I would not.

806
01:02:48,904 --> 01:02:51,034
- Oh, you know you would.
- I absolutely would not.

807
01:02:51,198 --> 01:02:53,028
Shh, here he comes.

808
01:02:54,535 --> 01:02:55,945
Hi.

809
01:02:59,707 --> 01:03:01,327
All right.

810
01:03:19,477 --> 01:03:22,017
Bud, why aren't you
going out for track this year?

811
01:03:22,188 --> 01:03:24,478
Got all that work to make up
from when I was sick.

812
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:26,518
You going to Yale?

813
01:03:26,817 --> 01:03:27,847
You going to Yale?

814
01:03:28,027 --> 01:03:29,897
Yeah, yeah, if my grades
are good enough.

815
01:03:30,071 --> 01:03:33,901
Hey, Bud, how come
you're not dating Deanie anymore?

816
01:03:34,075 --> 01:03:36,855
- I'm just not.
- I guess I'll just go to cow college.

817
01:03:37,036 --> 01:03:39,196
I'm only a farmer and I know it.

818
01:03:39,372 --> 01:03:42,082
Hot dog, now it's my chance.

819
01:03:42,583 --> 01:03:44,623
Any objections?

820
01:03:48,631 --> 01:03:50,871
I can't stop you.

821
01:04:02,687 --> 01:04:06,767
Deanie. Come on, honey, supper's ready.

822
01:04:14,156 --> 01:04:17,276
Deanie. Come on, honey.

823
01:04:20,705 --> 01:04:24,365
Deanie, come on. Supper's getting cold.

824
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:33,080
Veal roast, mashed potatoes
and succotash for my girl.

825
01:04:33,259 --> 01:04:36,209
Eat a good meal, Deanie.
Make you feel better.

826
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:40,877
Always drink plenty of milk, Deanie.

827
01:04:48,816 --> 01:04:50,476
Deanie?

828
01:04:55,531 --> 01:04:57,071
Eat your dinner.

829
01:04:57,241 --> 01:05:01,291
Seventy-six and three-eighths.
What do you know about that, huh?

830
01:05:01,454 --> 01:05:05,924
Seventy-six and three-eights.
Oh, Del. Did you hear that, Deanie?

831
01:05:06,083 --> 01:05:09,253
We're rich. We're rich!

832
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:17,089
I'll bet the Stampers
are feeling good these days.

833
01:05:17,261 --> 01:05:21,511
Honey, we're gonna send you to college.
We'll get a new car. That I promise you.

834
01:05:21,682 --> 01:05:24,262
Saw young Stamper
driving down the street this afternoon.

835
01:05:24,435 --> 01:05:28,425
Crowd of boys in the car.
Brand-new car his father got him.

836
01:05:34,779 --> 01:05:38,149
Deanie, stop it.
Stop carrying on this way.

837
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:48,236
Mom, I can't eat. I can't study.

838
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:51,367
I can't even face my friends anymore.

839
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:55,495
I wanna die. I wanna die.

840
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:57,713
Del.

841
01:06:05,518 --> 01:06:07,638
Do you feel better, dear?

842
01:06:09,146 --> 01:06:11,306
Oh, yes.

843
01:06:12,066 --> 01:06:14,976
Oh, yes. Yes.

844
01:06:15,152 --> 01:06:17,992
There's nothing like a good soak, ha.

845
01:06:18,155 --> 01:06:23,825
Deanie, tell me, what's been the matter
the past few days?

846
01:06:26,163 --> 01:06:28,623
I'm sorry I've troubled you.

847
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,993
I didn't wanna worry you.

848
01:06:33,004 --> 01:06:34,674
I didn't wanna worry anyone.

849
01:06:35,006 --> 01:06:38,666
Is it all on account of--? Because of Bud?

850
01:06:38,843 --> 01:06:41,853
Because he doesn't call
for you anymore?

851
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:44,670
I don't know.

852
01:06:45,683 --> 01:06:47,343
I don't know, Mom.

853
01:06:47,518 --> 01:06:49,428
I have a mind to call that boy
and tell him--

854
01:06:49,603 --> 01:06:51,983
Don't you dare! Don't you dare, Mom!

855
01:06:52,148 --> 01:06:54,848
- Don't you dare! Don't you dare!
- Deanie, I won't do it.

856
01:06:59,196 --> 01:07:02,026
Mama, you do something like that...

857
01:07:02,199 --> 01:07:04,529
...I'll do something desperate.

858
01:07:04,702 --> 01:07:08,702
I will. I will, Mom. I will.

859
01:07:10,374 --> 01:07:14,214
Deanie, how serious
did you and Bud become?

860
01:07:14,879 --> 01:07:18,709
I mean-- Now, you know what I mean.

861
01:07:20,634 --> 01:07:24,224
Deanie, had he...?

862
01:07:24,555 --> 01:07:27,215
Had anything serious happened?

863
01:07:28,809 --> 01:07:30,059
Did he...?

864
01:07:31,812 --> 01:07:33,142
Did he spoil you?

865
01:07:34,148 --> 01:07:39,388
Spoil? Ha, ha. Did he spoil me? No.

866
01:07:39,570 --> 01:07:41,320
Deanie.

867
01:07:44,992 --> 01:07:49,242
No! No, Mom! I'm not spoiled!

868
01:07:49,413 --> 01:07:51,743
- I'm not spoiled, Mom.
- Deanie?

869
01:07:51,916 --> 01:07:54,746
I'm just as fresh and I'm virginal
like the day I was born, Mom.

870
01:07:54,919 --> 01:07:55,949
Stop it. Stop it.

871
01:07:56,128 --> 01:07:58,958
I'm the virginal creature
who wouldn't think of being spoiled.

872
01:07:59,131 --> 01:08:01,971
- Stop it, please. Del, Del.
- I've been a good little girl.

873
01:08:02,134 --> 01:08:03,934
- Good little girl!
- What the matter?

874
01:08:04,095 --> 01:08:07,465
I've done everything Daddy and
Mommy tell me. I've obeyed every word.

875
01:08:07,640 --> 01:08:11,510
- I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!
- Del.

876
01:08:15,147 --> 01:08:18,397
- What's wrong? People can hear all over.
- What are we going to do?

877
01:08:19,402 --> 01:08:21,112
Leave me alone.

878
01:08:21,278 --> 01:08:24,358
- Good grief, what are we gonna do?
- Give her some of that medicine.

879
01:08:24,532 --> 01:08:27,112
Oh, Del, I hate to
give it to her so often.

880
01:08:27,284 --> 01:08:28,664
I'm not spoiled.

881
01:08:28,828 --> 01:08:32,658
- I'm not spoiled, Mama!
- What else can we do?

882
01:08:37,420 --> 01:08:40,380
Deanie, open this door, dear.

883
01:08:40,548 --> 01:08:42,538
Deanie, open the door.

884
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,370
What are you doing? Deanie?

885
01:08:48,973 --> 01:08:52,763
Maybe we should take her to Wichita
like Doc Smiley suggested.

886
01:08:52,935 --> 01:08:56,765
A psychiatrist? Oh, Del.

887
01:08:58,065 --> 01:09:00,555
It'll take money,
but I'll sell those stocks if I have to.

888
01:09:00,735 --> 01:09:02,255
Del, I can't believe
it's that serious.

889
01:09:02,361 --> 01:09:04,111
She's bound to get over it
in a little time.

890
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:08,780
There's never been any mental trouble
in either of our families.

891
01:09:18,502 --> 01:09:22,502
- Who's this?
- Probably one of her school friends.

892
01:09:24,884 --> 01:09:28,844
How do you do, folks? My name's
Alan Tuttle. They call me Toots.

893
01:09:29,013 --> 01:09:31,263
Yes. Yes, I've heard
Deanie speak of you.

894
01:09:31,432 --> 01:09:32,462
How do you do?

895
01:09:32,641 --> 01:09:35,681
I thought I'd drop in
and say hello to Deanie.

896
01:09:40,941 --> 01:09:42,651
Hi, Deanie.

897
01:09:43,694 --> 01:09:44,984
Hi, Toots.

898
01:09:46,739 --> 01:09:49,029
How are you feeling, Deanie?

899
01:09:49,659 --> 01:09:51,119
I feel all right.

900
01:09:51,911 --> 01:09:54,831
Well, if you two young folks
will pardon us, we'll....

901
01:09:54,997 --> 01:09:56,957
It's almost time for supper.

902
01:09:57,124 --> 01:09:58,954
Very nice to have met you folks.

903
01:09:59,126 --> 01:10:00,946
Yes.

904
01:10:01,545 --> 01:10:03,365
What have you done to your hair?

905
01:10:04,632 --> 01:10:07,422
Enjoyed meeting you too, Toots.

906
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:10,549
I've been meaning
to come over a long time, Deanie.

907
01:10:10,721 --> 01:10:12,881
To see how you were getting along.

908
01:10:13,724 --> 01:10:15,274
Did you see her hair?

909
01:10:15,434 --> 01:10:16,474
Thanks, Toots.

910
01:10:16,644 --> 01:10:18,164
Shh, I wanna hear what they're saying.

911
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:19,217
You look fine.

912
01:10:19,397 --> 01:10:22,557
- She's out there in her robe.
- Call no attention to it.

913
01:10:23,150 --> 01:10:26,150
- Thanks, Toots.
- Shh!

914
01:10:30,866 --> 01:10:33,486
So I was wondering if maybe, uh....

915
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,240
Well, maybe you wouldn't like
to go to the dance.

916
01:10:39,542 --> 01:10:41,172
Well, I....

917
01:10:41,335 --> 01:10:45,415
I'd probably be an awful drip
at the dance, Toots.

918
01:10:45,589 --> 01:10:49,369
Look, why don't you say you'll go, and
if anything happens in the meantime...

919
01:10:49,552 --> 01:10:52,592
...you change your mind
or you don't feel like it...?

920
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,007
Huh?

921
01:10:56,726 --> 01:10:59,266
<i>She's a tease, she's a flirt</i>

922
01:11:01,564 --> 01:11:05,064
<i>Everybody's wild about Mabel
She's the talk of the town</i>

923
01:11:05,234 --> 01:11:07,694
- Have a wonderful time.
- I'll take care of her.

924
01:11:07,862 --> 01:11:10,532
- Oh, thank you.
- Toots.

925
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:16,187
- Good night, Deanie.
- Good night.

926
01:11:16,370 --> 01:11:18,410
I'll leave the door open.

927
01:11:18,581 --> 01:11:22,201
And, Deanie, don't stay out too late.

928
01:11:23,502 --> 01:11:25,832
"Don't stay out too late."
Did you hear her?

929
01:11:26,005 --> 01:11:28,325
She's been saying that to me
since I was knee-high.

930
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:32,637
I used to think it meant something,
but it doesn't. It doesn't mean a thing.

931
01:11:48,778 --> 01:11:51,898
Hello, Deanie. Glad to see you.

932
01:11:52,365 --> 01:11:55,025
- Hello, Toots.
- Hi, coach.

933
01:12:03,751 --> 01:12:06,121
- Deanie.
- Deanie.

934
01:12:06,295 --> 01:12:08,535
You look just beautiful!
Look at your hair.

935
01:12:08,714 --> 01:12:11,174
- Thanks. Oh, I cut my hair.
- You're here!

936
01:12:11,342 --> 01:12:14,882
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh, Deanie.

937
01:12:30,027 --> 01:12:33,357
He's here. And guess who with. Kay.

938
01:12:41,872 --> 01:12:43,622
Hi, Deanie.

939
01:12:44,542 --> 01:12:48,042
- Hi.
- Would you dance with me, Toots?

940
01:12:49,046 --> 01:12:51,206
All right with you, Deanie?

941
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:54,543
Sure.

942
01:12:54,719 --> 01:12:58,219
- Sure, go ahead.
- Come on.

943
01:13:06,814 --> 01:13:10,074
- Hi.
- Well, how are you, Deanie?

944
01:13:10,693 --> 01:13:13,483
All right, I guess. I don't know.

945
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,520
How are you?

946
01:13:18,367 --> 01:13:20,407
All right, I guess.

947
01:13:22,997 --> 01:13:25,537
So, what's...?

948
01:13:25,708 --> 01:13:27,418
You like?

949
01:13:30,963 --> 01:13:34,833
- Come on outside for a cigarette.
- Okay.

950
01:13:38,804 --> 01:13:40,934
When did you start smoking?

951
01:13:41,098 --> 01:13:44,758
Oh, the past few weeks.
I had to do something.

952
01:13:44,935 --> 01:13:47,935
Mom had a fit,
but she doesn't say anything anymore.

953
01:13:53,778 --> 01:13:55,568
Bud....

954
01:13:57,406 --> 01:14:00,406
- I know why you quit coming by.
- Deanie, let's not talk about it.

955
01:14:00,576 --> 01:14:01,946
I've gotta talk about it, Bud.

956
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:06,829
All I've done in the past couple months
is just sit home and think about it.

957
01:14:06,999 --> 01:14:08,789
Hey, get out of there.

958
01:14:08,959 --> 01:14:12,409
You said you weren't gonna see him
anymore and here you are in his car.

959
01:14:12,588 --> 01:14:15,708
Deanie, I wanna tell you something.

960
01:14:16,133 --> 01:14:17,513
Every night after dinner...

961
01:14:17,677 --> 01:14:20,927
...I have to force myself from
going to the telephone and calling you.

962
01:14:21,097 --> 01:14:22,837
Oh, Bud.

963
01:14:23,015 --> 01:14:25,305
Deanie, I think about you
all the time, but--

964
01:14:25,476 --> 01:14:27,186
Oh, Bud.

965
01:14:30,314 --> 01:14:32,314
Where's your car?

966
01:14:34,402 --> 01:14:36,732
Oh, come on.

967
01:14:42,660 --> 01:14:44,400
Bud.

968
01:14:46,038 --> 01:14:50,118
- Please, Bud. Please.
- Deanie, cut it out.

969
01:14:50,292 --> 01:14:54,242
- Now, Bud.
- Deanie, you're a nice girl.

970
01:14:54,755 --> 01:14:56,995
I'm not.

971
01:14:57,341 --> 01:14:59,131
I'm not a nice girl.

972
01:14:59,301 --> 01:15:00,761
Come on, cut it out.

973
01:15:00,928 --> 01:15:04,628
I just can't go on like this anymore.

974
01:15:05,224 --> 01:15:07,224
Come on, Deanie,
we're gonna go back inside.

975
01:15:07,393 --> 01:15:11,473
No. No, I don't wanna go back inside.
Bud, I wanna stay here with you.

976
01:15:11,647 --> 01:15:13,717
- I want you.
- This isn't the way it should be.

977
01:15:13,899 --> 01:15:17,019
Why? Why not? Why not?
Why don't you, Bud? Why don't you?

978
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:19,324
Deanie, where's your pride?

979
01:15:19,488 --> 01:15:22,938
- My pride? My pride?
- Deanie.

980
01:15:23,117 --> 01:15:25,607
- I don't want my pride.
- Stop it.

981
01:15:25,786 --> 01:15:28,196
Stop it, Deanie. Stop.

982
01:15:28,372 --> 01:15:31,372
- Go on, go on. I haven't any pride.
- Deanie.

983
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:32,872
I haven't any pride!

984
01:15:33,044 --> 01:15:35,964
Oh, God, Deanie,
what am I gonna do with you?

985
01:15:38,382 --> 01:15:40,922
I don't care what you do.

986
01:15:41,093 --> 01:15:45,923
I don't care what happens.
I haven't any pride.

987
01:15:48,893 --> 01:15:50,693
I just wanna die.

988
01:15:50,853 --> 01:15:53,563
I just wanna die.

989
01:16:06,243 --> 01:16:10,333
Take me away from here.
Take me away from here.

990
01:16:26,847 --> 01:16:29,137
It's okay, you'll be all right.

991
01:16:36,607 --> 01:16:38,147
Come here.

992
01:17:30,286 --> 01:17:31,696
I put some bread on to set.

993
01:17:31,871 --> 01:17:35,321
We're gonna have some good
homemade bread for a couple of days.

994
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:39,705
- What are you thinking about, Del?
- Hmm, just worrying about our little girl.

995
01:17:39,879 --> 01:17:41,159
Oh, she's all right now.

996
01:17:41,339 --> 01:17:44,839
Why, she's at the dance and I'll bet you
she's having the time of her life.

997
01:17:45,009 --> 01:17:46,039
Drink your milk.

998
01:17:47,261 --> 01:17:49,171
Stop it.

999
01:17:50,681 --> 01:17:52,681
Stop it.

1000
01:17:53,476 --> 01:17:56,096
Don't, Bud, don't.

1001
01:17:56,437 --> 01:17:58,057
Bud?

1002
01:18:02,401 --> 01:18:05,571
Deanie, come back here.
Where you going?

1003
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:08,729
Deanie?

1004
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:16,120
Deanie? Deanie, come back.

1005
01:18:17,833 --> 01:18:19,663
Stop it.

1006
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,430
Oh, Bud.

1007
01:18:35,559 --> 01:18:38,979
- Bud.
- Deanie, come back here.

1008
01:18:44,568 --> 01:18:46,558
Deanie?

1009
01:19:29,572 --> 01:19:31,402
Hey, you can't go out there!

1010
01:19:32,116 --> 01:19:34,406
Hey, you, come back here!

1011
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:38,159
Hey. Hey, you, come back here.

1012
01:19:38,331 --> 01:19:39,711
Hey, isn't that Deanie Loomis?

1013
01:19:39,874 --> 01:19:41,624
What's the matter with you?
Come here.

1014
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:44,632
What's the matter with you? Come here.

1015
01:20:05,274 --> 01:20:07,814
<i>Oh, Bud.</i>

1016
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:11,399
Hey, she dove in.
What's wrong with that girl?

1017
01:20:11,864 --> 01:20:13,744
Somebody better get her.

1018
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:18,120
Billy, come on.

1019
01:20:18,746 --> 01:20:19,906
Go on in there after her.

1020
01:20:36,305 --> 01:20:37,925
Come on.

1021
01:20:38,516 --> 01:20:41,006
Get away. Leave me alone.

1022
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:47,846
Bud.

1023
01:20:48,025 --> 01:20:51,685
She hasn't spoken a word of
sense since they brought her in here.

1024
01:20:53,698 --> 01:20:56,018
Stay close to her.

1025
01:20:59,745 --> 01:21:02,575
- Any word?
- No, not yet.

1026
01:21:05,751 --> 01:21:07,541
Not yet.

1027
01:21:09,630 --> 01:21:11,170
Not yet.

1028
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,210
My baby, my baby. Why did she do it?

1029
01:21:18,305 --> 01:21:20,095
I don't wanna see you ever again.

1030
01:21:20,266 --> 01:21:23,046
- Mama, quit talking like that.
- I don't care.

1031
01:21:23,227 --> 01:21:27,007
He's the cause of all her trouble.
He's the cause.

1032
01:21:29,066 --> 01:21:32,226
- What did you do to her tonight?
- Now, Mama.

1033
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:34,200
I want him to answer me.

1034
01:21:34,363 --> 01:21:36,073
Bud, she doesn't
mean what she's saying.

1035
01:21:36,240 --> 01:21:38,150
I do too.

1036
01:21:39,618 --> 01:21:44,778
- My little girl. I want my little girl.
- Mama, quit getting all worked up.

1037
01:21:44,957 --> 01:21:49,337
How can I help getting worked up
when my baby...?

1038
01:21:49,503 --> 01:21:53,093
My baby lies there fighting for her life.

1039
01:21:54,675 --> 01:21:56,835
Frieda, I'm sorry.

1040
01:21:57,094 --> 01:22:01,264
By George, Del,
I'm sorry to hear about this.

1041
01:22:05,936 --> 01:22:07,676
Son.

1042
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:10,220
Is she all right?

1043
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,609
They don't know
what's the matter yet, Dad.

1044
01:22:15,571 --> 01:22:16,771
Del.

1045
01:22:17,448 --> 01:22:19,738
I'm afraid your daughter's
in a very nervous condition.

1046
01:22:19,909 --> 01:22:20,939
I wanna see my baby.

1047
01:22:21,118 --> 01:22:22,948
Not now, Mrs. Loomis.
Perhaps tomorrow.

1048
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:25,960
Have you thought about
what I suggested to you?

1049
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:29,163
- Yes, I'm going through with it.
- Oh, Del.

1050
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:32,085
I'm gonna sell those stocks and
send that girl off to Wichita...

1051
01:22:32,254 --> 01:22:33,344
...as soon as she's ready.

1052
01:22:33,506 --> 01:22:35,376
Good, I'll make the
arrangements for you.

1053
01:22:35,549 --> 01:22:36,579
All right.

1054
01:22:36,759 --> 01:22:40,629
Now, Mama, I think it's time
you and I were home in bed.

1055
01:22:40,805 --> 01:22:47,385
Doc, look, I'm gonna marry Deanie.
I don't care what he says, doc.

1056
01:22:48,771 --> 01:22:50,651
- Good night, Bud.
- Good night, Mr. Loomis.

1057
01:22:50,815 --> 01:22:54,015
I'm legal aged, I don't care what
he says. Doc, I'm gonna marry her.

1058
01:22:54,193 --> 01:22:55,653
Bud.

1059
01:23:09,959 --> 01:23:11,499
Nurse.

1060
01:23:25,891 --> 01:23:27,091
Bud.

1061
01:23:29,937 --> 01:23:33,517
Bud, do you wanna help Deanie?
Then stay away from her.

1062
01:23:35,484 --> 01:23:37,364
- For how long?
- I don't know.

1063
01:23:37,528 --> 01:23:40,278
I don't know now. No one does.

1064
01:24:04,722 --> 01:24:06,552
Who's that?

1065
01:24:08,893 --> 01:24:13,893
- Who's there? Who's there?
- There's nobody, nobody.

1066
01:24:15,149 --> 01:24:18,519
Was somebody here?
Somebody was here.

1067
01:24:18,694 --> 01:24:19,774
Somebody was here.

1068
01:24:34,335 --> 01:24:36,285
You have another letter from your father.

1069
01:24:59,777 --> 01:25:03,107
I'm beginning to think
you wanna get thrown out of school.

1070
01:25:21,924 --> 01:25:23,884
Angelina.

1071
01:25:29,223 --> 01:25:30,643
Excuse me.

1072
01:25:34,186 --> 01:25:36,886
- Angelina.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1073
01:25:41,402 --> 01:25:43,362
Hey, uh....

1074
01:25:44,155 --> 01:25:50,105
Angelina, do you think I could have
another one of these home brews?

1075
01:25:51,162 --> 01:25:54,952
Mister, you drink, you're gonna get sick.

1076
01:25:56,083 --> 01:26:00,163
Let me bring you some food.
Would you like something to eat?

1077
01:26:00,838 --> 01:26:04,498
My mama's making some pizza in
the kitchen. Would you like some pizza?

1078
01:26:04,967 --> 01:26:06,677
What is pizza?

1079
01:26:06,844 --> 01:26:10,104
You don't know what pizza is? Ha, ha.
Where are you from?

1080
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:15,007
- I'm from Kansas.
- Kansas.

1081
01:26:15,311 --> 01:26:16,341
Where is that?

1082
01:26:18,356 --> 01:26:20,806
It's right in the middle of the U.S.A.

1083
01:26:26,113 --> 01:26:28,193
So that's where your home is.

1084
01:26:28,366 --> 01:26:29,936
Hmm.

1085
01:26:30,117 --> 01:26:32,357
Is it nice out there in Kansas?

1086
01:26:35,831 --> 01:26:36,861
Yup.

1087
01:26:41,045 --> 01:26:43,115
It's very friendly.

1088
01:26:44,924 --> 01:26:47,334
That's what it's like, it's friendly.

1089
01:26:47,968 --> 01:26:52,128
Everybody knows your name,
and they know who you are.

1090
01:26:53,349 --> 01:26:55,589
Why don't you go back?

1091
01:26:56,811 --> 01:26:58,691
You must have a sweetheart out there.

1092
01:27:00,981 --> 01:27:02,691
I did.

1093
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:13,570
Come on out in the kitchen with me.
My mom will give you some pizza.

1094
01:27:15,079 --> 01:27:18,329
- Well, I--
- Come on. Sure.

1095
01:27:21,168 --> 01:27:24,838
- I'll have some pizza.
- Heh, heh. Come on.

1096
01:27:32,054 --> 01:27:35,144
- That's fine, you're up.
- Angelina?

1097
01:27:35,349 --> 01:27:36,889
- You all right?
- Angelina.

1098
01:27:37,059 --> 01:27:38,259
- Mama?
- Here.

1099
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:40,560
No.

1100
01:27:41,188 --> 01:27:42,928
What?

1101
01:27:43,774 --> 01:27:46,234
- What?
- Are you all right, mister?

1102
01:27:46,444 --> 01:27:48,024
Sure you are.

1103
01:27:48,195 --> 01:27:49,225
Uh-huh.
- Hi.

1104
01:27:49,405 --> 01:27:53,485
Steady as she goes.
Sit on that bench. I'll be right with you.

1105
01:27:53,659 --> 01:27:55,199
All right?

1106
01:27:56,329 --> 01:27:58,319
No, that's for Mr. Mangolomino.

1107
01:28:09,467 --> 01:28:10,627
What do you think--?

1108
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:13,641
What do you think about that?
Sort of squint your eyes a bit.

1109
01:28:13,804 --> 01:28:16,644
- What would Cézanne say to that?
- Well, that's swell, Deanie.

1110
01:28:19,643 --> 01:28:22,273
I never thought
I could do this well, really.

1111
01:28:22,438 --> 01:28:25,228
Looks better with one eye closed.

1112
01:28:26,817 --> 01:28:28,977
Oh, you. Ha-ha-ha.

1113
01:28:30,821 --> 01:28:34,321
I like metalwork though. You can get rid
of a lot of hostilities this way.

1114
01:28:34,492 --> 01:28:36,072
Watch.

1115
01:28:37,536 --> 01:28:41,366
Every time I pound,
I tell myself it's my old man.

1116
01:28:44,377 --> 01:28:48,417
My old man had his heart set
on my being a surgeon.

1117
01:28:48,589 --> 01:28:53,549
Well, not just a surgeon,
but the greatest surgeon who ever lived.

1118
01:28:56,138 --> 01:29:00,178
Well, so anyway,
I couldn't make that first cut.

1119
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:05,192
That first cut into the flesh
of another man's body.

1120
01:29:05,398 --> 01:29:09,178
I shook. I couldn't keep
my hands steady, firm--

1121
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,930
Oh, you can still be an M.D.
when you get out though.

1122
01:29:12,113 --> 01:29:16,823
- If I ever get out.
- Oh, Johnny, don't talk like that.

1123
01:29:16,993 --> 01:29:18,323
I'm kidding, I hope.

1124
01:29:18,494 --> 01:29:21,204
Deanie, your parents
are in the waiting room.

1125
01:29:21,372 --> 01:29:23,532
Mother and Dad are here?

1126
01:29:27,962 --> 01:29:31,252
Johnny, my folks are here. I haven't
seen them for about six months.

1127
01:29:31,424 --> 01:29:32,674
Not since I've been here.

1128
01:29:40,599 --> 01:29:43,219
Oh, Del, I hope these
people know what they're doing.

1129
01:29:43,394 --> 01:29:46,684
How much longer
are they gonna keep her here?

1130
01:29:49,525 --> 01:29:51,435
Here she comes.

1131
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:01,570
Oh, my.

1132
01:30:01,746 --> 01:30:04,366
Mom, don't let Deanie see you
looking this way.

1133
01:30:13,924 --> 01:30:17,844
- My baby! My little baby.
- It's good to see you.

1134
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:21,352
Oh, Daddy. Oh, it's so good to see you.

1135
01:30:21,515 --> 01:30:24,265
Oh, doesn't she look just fine, Del?

1136
01:30:24,435 --> 01:30:27,595
Oh, they can't tell me there's
anything wrong with my little baby.

1137
01:30:27,772 --> 01:30:30,312
Why, she's just as sound and normal
as the next one.

1138
01:30:30,483 --> 01:30:32,393
I brought our little girl a box of candy.

1139
01:30:32,568 --> 01:30:34,438
- Oh, thank you, Daddy.
- Come on, honey.

1140
01:30:34,612 --> 01:30:37,782
And all the girls in your old gang
wanted to tell you hello.

1141
01:30:37,948 --> 01:30:40,868
Oh, yes. Your father had to go
and tell everyone where you are.

1142
01:30:41,035 --> 01:30:44,815
- Oh, I'm not ashamed, Mom.
- Come on, sit down, sit down.

1143
01:30:45,289 --> 01:30:47,329
Well.

1144
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:49,707
Now, let's see.

1145
01:30:49,877 --> 01:30:53,077
Um, Kay's gone off to
Mrs. Finch's school. Very elegant.

1146
01:30:53,255 --> 01:30:56,375
Oh, her folks are very wealthy now,
you know. Ha, ha.

1147
01:30:56,550 --> 01:31:00,470
And June, June calls about you
every week or so.

1148
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:03,968
- I guess you know she married Bob?
- Oh, yes, we write once in a while.

1149
01:31:04,141 --> 01:31:06,271
And Carolyn and June
are off at the university.

1150
01:31:06,435 --> 01:31:08,835
Now, Carolyn pledged, um, Pi Phi.

1151
01:31:09,021 --> 01:31:13,521
And Hazel, um, pledged Kappa.
Which is better?

1152
01:31:13,693 --> 01:31:16,103
- I don't know.
- The university isn't far from here--

1153
01:31:16,278 --> 01:31:17,308
Mom.

1154
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,190
Mama.

1155
01:31:24,412 --> 01:31:28,032
Maybe you'd like them to come
and see you some Saturday.

1156
01:31:32,169 --> 01:31:34,249
I don't think so, Mom.

1157
01:31:34,672 --> 01:31:36,002
Oh.

1158
01:31:36,257 --> 01:31:39,757
No, no, I guess not.

1159
01:31:39,927 --> 01:31:43,427
I guess it wouldn't be suitable.

1160
01:31:44,598 --> 01:31:50,688
But there's nothing the matter with you.
You just remember that.

1161
01:31:50,855 --> 01:31:56,015
You are perfectly all right.

1162
01:31:56,193 --> 01:32:01,493
Just as well off as Kay, or June,
or Hazel, or any of those girls.

1163
01:32:15,838 --> 01:32:18,508
- Mama.
- Yeah?

1164
01:32:19,383 --> 01:32:21,293
Maybe....

1165
01:32:27,558 --> 01:32:32,018
Deanie, would you like to have dinner
with us tonight down at the hotel?

1166
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:34,390
I, uh....

1167
01:32:36,692 --> 01:32:37,722
I, uh....

1168
01:32:37,902 --> 01:32:40,652
Deanie's had a very trying day,
she's too tired.

1169
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:42,321
Yes, I'm awfully--

1170
01:32:42,490 --> 01:32:47,240
We're not gonna see any more of you?

1171
01:32:48,371 --> 01:32:53,791
This? This is all we get to see of you?

1172
01:32:54,919 --> 01:32:57,129
Mom, I'm sorry.

1173
01:33:03,094 --> 01:33:06,934
We drove all the way up here
just to be with our baby.

1174
01:33:07,390 --> 01:33:09,760
Now they tell us
we can't be with her tonight.

1175
01:33:09,934 --> 01:33:13,644
You want what's best for your daughter,
don't you, Mrs. Loomis?

1176
01:33:14,772 --> 01:33:16,652
Yes.

1177
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:21,268
Yes, I want what's best
for my daughter.

1178
01:33:21,737 --> 01:33:25,437
- We'll take our little girl out to dinner--
- I'm sorry.

1179
01:33:35,084 --> 01:33:37,664
--the next time we come up, Mama.

1180
01:33:38,963 --> 01:33:41,633
Mom kept calling me her baby.

1181
01:33:41,799 --> 01:33:46,429
And dad kept calling me his little girl.

1182
01:33:48,681 --> 01:33:52,021
Dr. Judd, don't they realize I'm me?

1183
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:55,810
You're the one who's gotta change,
they can't.

1184
01:33:56,313 --> 01:33:58,523
I don't think I could ever
go back home again.

1185
01:33:58,691 --> 01:34:02,691
I don't think I could feel the same way
I used to feel about them.

1186
01:34:02,862 --> 01:34:05,652
You'll just have to
accept them as people.

1187
01:34:05,823 --> 01:34:11,253
With a lot of faults maybe,
but not as "Mama" and "Papa."

1188
01:34:11,412 --> 01:34:14,082
- As people?
- Hmm.

1189
01:34:15,082 --> 01:34:18,502
You know, we blame our parents
for everything these days.

1190
01:34:20,129 --> 01:34:22,619
You gotta remember
they had parents too.

1191
01:34:22,798 --> 01:34:24,668
I suppose.

1192
01:34:27,636 --> 01:34:29,176
You had a mama and a papa too.

1193
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,510
Oh, yes, most assuredly.

1194
01:34:34,518 --> 01:34:37,218
That will be all, Deanie. You can go now.

1195
01:34:40,524 --> 01:34:41,694
I'll see you tomorrow.

1196
01:34:49,075 --> 01:34:50,895
Deanie?

1197
01:34:51,369 --> 01:34:53,829
Have you heard from that young man?

1198
01:34:54,205 --> 01:34:57,235
What was his name? Bud?

1199
01:35:01,045 --> 01:35:02,865
No.

1200
01:35:04,048 --> 01:35:07,088
No, we've, um, given up writing.

1201
01:35:07,259 --> 01:35:10,879
I guess he's probably away at school.

1202
01:35:11,722 --> 01:35:13,382
I don't know.

1203
01:35:13,557 --> 01:35:16,387
No one ever writes me
anything about him.

1204
01:35:18,771 --> 01:35:21,061
I guess they're afraid
that it would upset me.

1205
01:35:21,982 --> 01:35:23,022
Well, would it?

1206
01:35:30,241 --> 01:35:32,911
Well, maybe you'll feel
a little stronger about it in time.

1207
01:35:34,537 --> 01:35:36,407
I hope so.

1208
01:35:55,850 --> 01:35:58,770
I'll bet they've been practicing
some of that Freud on her too.

1209
01:35:58,936 --> 01:36:02,596
Oh, I've read about him.
All he's concerned about is sex.

1210
01:36:02,773 --> 01:36:06,233
And it's costing us every blessed penny
we made on our stocks.

1211
01:36:06,402 --> 01:36:09,192
If we could have held on to those
stocks, we would've made a fortune.

1212
01:36:10,573 --> 01:36:12,553
I don't think it's very polite
of you to turn on...

1213
01:36:12,575 --> 01:36:14,045
...the radio when I'm talking to you.

1214
01:36:14,076 --> 01:36:17,076
<i>Stock prices crashed
today in the most disastrous trading...</i>

1215
01:36:17,246 --> 01:36:19,486
<i>...ever encountered
on the New York Stock Exchange.</i>

1216
01:36:19,665 --> 01:36:23,275
<i>Fourteen billion dollars was lost
in a nationwide attempt to unload.</i>

1217
01:36:23,461 --> 01:36:25,251
"Sell out"?
What do you mean, sell out?

1218
01:36:25,421 --> 01:36:27,421
You're getting panicky
like everybody else.

1219
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:29,800
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1220
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:33,417
Now, just don't get panicky, Jack.
Don't lose your courage.

1221
01:36:34,805 --> 01:36:35,835
Come in.

1222
01:36:36,015 --> 01:36:40,095
Hang on, Jack. Just hang on.
Just hang in there.

1223
01:36:40,269 --> 01:36:42,639
No, listen, I can't go on with this
right now, Jack.

1224
01:36:42,813 --> 01:36:45,143
- Sit down, friend, I'll be right with you.
- Okay.

1225
01:36:45,941 --> 01:36:47,771
I'm in New Haven.

1226
01:36:48,152 --> 01:36:50,562
Oh, my kid's in school up here.

1227
01:36:50,738 --> 01:36:56,078
Oh, hell, he's doing just fine. Flunking
every course, but otherwise fine.

1228
01:36:56,243 --> 01:37:01,043
No, he'll be all right.
I got an idea what's wrong with him.

1229
01:37:01,499 --> 01:37:03,579
Yeah, I'll be calling you.

1230
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:08,122
- Well, what did you find out?
- You were right.

1231
01:37:08,297 --> 01:37:09,327
I knew it, who is she?

1232
01:37:09,507 --> 01:37:10,837
- She's a waitress.
- Waitress?

1233
01:37:11,008 --> 01:37:13,758
In a pizza place. It's all right here.

1234
01:37:15,513 --> 01:37:17,263
You want a drink?

1235
01:37:19,058 --> 01:37:21,678
- Bud, suppose you--
- He just hasn't been applying himself.

1236
01:37:21,852 --> 01:37:24,522
I know my boy. He could pass
any course you offer...

1237
01:37:24,689 --> 01:37:26,309
...flying colors, straight A's.

1238
01:37:26,482 --> 01:37:27,942
Thank you.

1239
01:37:28,109 --> 01:37:30,979
Suppose you tell us
what you think is the matter, Bud.

1240
01:37:38,703 --> 01:37:42,323
Have you really been interested
in your work here at Yale?

1241
01:37:42,498 --> 01:37:43,608
- Well--
- Interested?

1242
01:37:43,791 --> 01:37:45,171
What difference does that make?

1243
01:37:45,334 --> 01:37:47,664
I sent you up here to make
your grades and graduate.

1244
01:37:47,837 --> 01:37:50,247
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Dad, but--

1245
01:37:50,423 --> 01:37:52,833
Now, why don't we just
talk turkey, son?

1246
01:37:53,342 --> 01:37:55,172
Why don't you tell us
what's on your mind.

1247
01:37:55,344 --> 01:37:57,014
What's eating up
your time and energy?

1248
01:37:57,179 --> 01:38:00,179
There's a long-distance call
from New York for Mr. Stamper.

1249
01:38:00,349 --> 01:38:03,599
- Urgent, right this way, sir.
- All right, thank you.

1250
01:38:11,652 --> 01:38:15,822
Is there anything you'd rather be
doing now than going to school here?

1251
01:38:15,990 --> 01:38:21,370
To tell you the truth, Dean Pollard,
I never wanted to do a thing but ranch.

1252
01:38:21,537 --> 01:38:22,617
But Dad--

1253
01:38:22,788 --> 01:38:25,908
I've never held the belief
that everybody should go to college.

1254
01:38:26,917 --> 01:38:28,877
Well, maybe you could talk to him.

1255
01:38:30,046 --> 01:38:33,246
He isn't a very good listener,
really, is he?

1256
01:38:40,931 --> 01:38:42,591
I gotta get back to New York right away.

1257
01:38:42,767 --> 01:38:46,137
Bud, suppose you let me, uh,
talk to your father.

1258
01:38:46,312 --> 01:38:48,982
Oh, yeah, sure. Thank you.

1259
01:38:50,066 --> 01:38:52,436
I'll see you back in your room, son.

1260
01:38:53,736 --> 01:38:56,566
Dean Pollard,
what's the matter with people?

1261
01:38:56,739 --> 01:38:58,399
What do you mean?

1262
01:38:59,283 --> 01:39:04,033
I mean the whole town of New York
is jumping out of windows.

1263
01:39:04,205 --> 01:39:05,825
I mean, they're quitting.

1264
01:39:05,998 --> 01:39:09,418
And things are gonna get back to normal
in a couple of days.

1265
01:39:09,585 --> 01:39:11,655
- You really think so?
- I know so, I know so.

1266
01:39:11,837 --> 01:39:13,957
They got to, they've got to.

1267
01:39:15,216 --> 01:39:20,716
Now, about the boy, I'm gonna take
him to New York with me...

1268
01:39:20,888 --> 01:39:24,178
...and I'll have him back up here
Monday morning...

1269
01:39:24,350 --> 01:39:26,890
...ready to settle down and go to work.

1270
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:29,731
I must say, Mr. Stamper...

1271
01:39:29,897 --> 01:39:32,597
...I do not feel that the boy
should remain in school here.

1272
01:39:33,067 --> 01:39:39,487
Please, don't give up on him.
Don't give up on him, Dean Pollard.

1273
01:39:40,491 --> 01:39:44,281
I had to go through something
like this with him once before.

1274
01:39:44,453 --> 01:39:48,623
He fall for some little girl
and then that's all he can think about.

1275
01:39:48,791 --> 01:39:53,421
- I don't think that's it--
- I think that's it, I think that's it!

1276
01:39:53,629 --> 01:39:58,339
I think I've known him a little bit longer
and a little bit better than you have.

1277
01:39:58,509 --> 01:40:00,349
I had to break up
something like this before...

1278
01:40:00,469 --> 01:40:02,149
...and I'm gonna have to
break it up again.

1279
01:40:02,221 --> 01:40:05,011
I'll have him Monday morning,
ready to go to work.

1280
01:40:16,277 --> 01:40:17,687
Kewpie dolls.

1281
01:40:18,529 --> 01:40:20,359
Kewpie dolls.

1282
01:40:20,531 --> 01:40:22,821
Would you like a kewpie doll
for your cutie-pie?

1283
01:40:22,992 --> 01:40:24,872
- Yeah, how much are they?
- Fifty dollars.

1284
01:40:25,036 --> 01:40:29,576
All right, you fish out 50 out of there
and you give me the rest back.

1285
01:40:33,085 --> 01:40:36,035
- Thank you.
- Oh, thank you.

1286
01:40:36,589 --> 01:40:38,549
- Bye.
- Bye.

1287
01:40:50,227 --> 01:40:53,147
They all look the same in this town.

1288
01:40:56,567 --> 01:40:58,437
The newlyweds.
Come on, stand up.

1289
01:40:58,611 --> 01:41:01,231
Give the little girl a hand.
She's earned it.

1290
01:41:11,082 --> 01:41:12,712
Hello, suckers.

1291
01:41:15,753 --> 01:41:18,333
I think I smell fresh money tonight.

1292
01:41:18,506 --> 01:41:21,756
I'm glad you didn't let a little thing
like the stock-market crash...

1293
01:41:21,926 --> 01:41:23,586
...keep you from coming out tonight.

1294
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:29,970
Tonight as I was walking down
Park Avenue to get a taxi...

1295
01:41:30,142 --> 01:41:34,942
...I had to dodge the bodies
jumping out of the windows.

1296
01:41:35,439 --> 01:41:38,059
Ahh, but let's don't be morbid.

1297
01:41:41,946 --> 01:41:43,656
- Same all around?
- No more for me.

1298
01:41:43,823 --> 01:41:45,953
Yeah. Same all around. Same all around.

1299
01:41:50,955 --> 01:41:53,785
Lay one on me. Lay one on me.

1300
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:58,125
- Hey, Dad, let's go.
- Wait, Bud, wait a minute, now.

1301
01:41:58,295 --> 01:42:00,585
I haven't gotten to the point
I'm trying to make.

1302
01:42:00,756 --> 01:42:05,376
I never have been able
to make this one point with you, son.

1303
01:42:10,808 --> 01:42:17,808
Bud, listen, I may not be around
too much longer and I--

1304
01:42:18,274 --> 01:42:20,314
- What are you talking about?
- Wait a minute.

1305
01:42:20,484 --> 01:42:23,904
Now, don't act so worried, I got no
intention of kicking off for a while.

1306
01:42:24,071 --> 01:42:26,111
What are you leading up to?

1307
01:42:28,701 --> 01:42:34,541
Bud, it may be that I haven't always
done the right thing by you, boy.

1308
01:42:34,707 --> 01:42:36,827
And I'm sorry.

1309
01:42:37,335 --> 01:42:41,415
Anything I might have taken away...

1310
01:42:41,839 --> 01:42:45,509
...I'd like to make it up to you.

1311
01:42:53,517 --> 01:42:55,347
Forget it, Dad.

1312
01:43:13,704 --> 01:43:17,214
Look up there.
Look up there on that stage.

1313
01:43:17,375 --> 01:43:18,695
Deanie.

1314
01:43:22,546 --> 01:43:24,916
Yeah, she does look
a little bit like Deanie.

1315
01:43:25,091 --> 01:43:26,551
Little, hell. Hell, a little.

1316
01:43:26,717 --> 01:43:30,217
Exactly the same damn thing.
Exactly the same damn thing.

1317
01:43:30,388 --> 01:43:32,708
Just as pretty, just as pretty.

1318
01:43:32,890 --> 01:43:36,260
You never been fair to me on that.
I did that for your own good.

1319
01:43:36,435 --> 01:43:38,505
How would you like
to be married to her now?

1320
01:43:38,688 --> 01:43:40,308
Did you ever think about that?

1321
01:43:40,481 --> 01:43:44,071
How would you like to be married
to Deanie and her in that institute?

1322
01:43:44,235 --> 01:43:46,555
Did you ever think about that?
How'd you like it?

1323
01:43:46,737 --> 01:43:49,437
How'd you like that,
her in that institution?

1324
01:43:50,116 --> 01:43:52,986
Oh, what the hell
difference does it make?

1325
01:43:53,160 --> 01:43:56,030
That's the same thing.
That's the same thing exactly.

1326
01:43:56,205 --> 01:43:58,575
And just as pretty, just as pretty.

1327
01:43:58,749 --> 01:44:01,869
You look up there at that, just as pretty.
You want that?

1328
01:44:02,044 --> 01:44:04,584
Do you want it, son?
If you want it, you can have it.

1329
01:44:04,755 --> 01:44:06,495
You can have it, boy. I'll get it for you.

1330
01:44:06,674 --> 01:44:08,254
You can have anything you want.

1331
01:44:08,426 --> 01:44:11,176
Anything you want, boy.
This world is your oyster.

1332
01:44:11,345 --> 01:44:14,255
You sit here, I'll show you.
You sit right there, I'll show you.

1333
01:44:14,432 --> 01:44:16,092
You sit there now and I'll show you.

1334
01:44:53,471 --> 01:44:55,261
Yeah?

1335
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:05,649
- Yeah?
- Are you Bud?

1336
01:45:06,108 --> 01:45:09,558
- Yes, ma'am.
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?

1337
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:23,330
I'm sorry, but I think
you must have got the wrong room.

1338
01:45:59,495 --> 01:46:01,195
Mr. Stamper?

1339
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:08,293
Mr. Stamper.

1340
01:46:35,906 --> 01:46:39,566
- That's him.
- What do you wanna do with, uh...?

1341
01:46:41,412 --> 01:46:43,412
I'll take him home.

1342
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:07,640
Well, I'll be home in a few hours.

1343
01:47:07,813 --> 01:47:09,393
First time in....

1344
01:47:09,565 --> 01:47:11,805
Two years and six months
almost to the day.

1345
01:47:11,984 --> 01:47:16,984
- How do you feel about going home?
- Like going to a foreign country.

1346
01:47:24,872 --> 01:47:28,922
Dr. Judd,
John has asked me to marry him.

1347
01:47:30,294 --> 01:47:31,964
And you waited until now to tell me?

1348
01:47:33,964 --> 01:47:37,474
- Well?
- Are you gonna accept?

1349
01:47:37,635 --> 01:47:40,965
- I don't know.
- Do you love John?

1350
01:47:43,224 --> 01:47:45,354
I think so.

1351
01:47:46,686 --> 01:47:53,436
It's different from the way
that I felt about Bud.

1352
01:47:55,736 --> 01:47:57,446
But I....

1353
01:47:59,240 --> 01:48:00,570
I love him.

1354
01:48:00,741 --> 01:48:05,291
Well, I see no reason why both of you
shouldn't have a very happy future.

1355
01:48:05,454 --> 01:48:08,874
John's back in Cincinnati now,
practicing medicine.

1356
01:48:09,041 --> 01:48:12,211
- Doing very well.
- Oh, I know.

1357
01:48:12,378 --> 01:48:14,538
I hear from him every day.

1358
01:48:17,341 --> 01:48:19,001
Oh.

1359
01:48:19,552 --> 01:48:21,512
My taxi.

1360
01:48:24,348 --> 01:48:28,178
- Well, I....
- Taxi's here.

1361
01:48:30,771 --> 01:48:33,561
Will you see Bud
when you're home?

1362
01:48:33,733 --> 01:48:35,013
I don't know.

1363
01:48:35,192 --> 01:48:37,322
Do you think you'll be happy
married to John...

1364
01:48:37,486 --> 01:48:41,186
...if you still don't know how you feel
about the other young man?

1365
01:48:43,200 --> 01:48:47,200
And when we face these fears,
they sometimes turn into nothing.

1366
01:48:48,456 --> 01:48:50,166
Deanie?

1367
01:48:51,459 --> 01:48:53,289
Deanie?

1368
01:49:00,885 --> 01:49:03,285
All right, Dr. Judd.

1369
01:49:04,138 --> 01:49:06,008
I'll see him.

1370
01:49:09,560 --> 01:49:11,520
I'll write to you.

1371
01:49:25,076 --> 01:49:26,156
Bye-bye.

1372
01:49:48,474 --> 01:49:51,184
I don't know why you couldn't have
married a boy from here.

1373
01:49:51,352 --> 01:49:54,602
You're not gonna be much company
for me living back east in Cincinnati.

1374
01:49:54,772 --> 01:49:57,262
What do you know
about this young man you're marrying?

1375
01:49:57,441 --> 01:50:00,891
After all, you met him in a mental
hospital. Are you sure he's all right?

1376
01:50:01,070 --> 01:50:04,110
- Well, I was in the hospital too.
- Well, with you it was different.

1377
01:50:04,281 --> 01:50:08,491
You were just run-down. That was
the only thing the matter with you.

1378
01:50:08,661 --> 01:50:09,941
Hmm....

1379
01:50:10,121 --> 01:50:13,741
- Is he a New-Dealer?
- I don't know.

1380
01:50:13,916 --> 01:50:19,866
I could cry, just cry,
when I think I'm gonna lose my little girl.

1381
01:50:20,131 --> 01:50:24,461
- How much did this cost?
- I don't know, Mother.

1382
01:50:32,435 --> 01:50:33,545
Deanie.

1383
01:50:34,478 --> 01:50:37,148
Did those doctors at the hospital say...

1384
01:50:37,314 --> 01:50:40,824
...your mother had raised you wrong
or something?

1385
01:50:41,485 --> 01:50:43,885
Did they blame your father...

1386
01:50:44,071 --> 01:50:48,901
...and me in any way?

1387
01:50:53,164 --> 01:50:55,124
I don't blame anyone, Mother.

1388
01:50:56,083 --> 01:51:00,083
I raised you the only way I knew how,
Deanie. The only way I knew how.

1389
01:51:00,588 --> 01:51:06,508
The way my mother raised me and
I suppose the way her mother raised her.

1390
01:51:07,386 --> 01:51:11,926
If I brought you up wrong, Deanie,
I don't think you should hate me.

1391
01:51:12,850 --> 01:51:16,350
Well, I know I used to hate
my mother at times...

1392
01:51:16,520 --> 01:51:19,940
...but I always believed
she was right about things.

1393
01:51:20,107 --> 01:51:21,817
Maybe she wasn't...

1394
01:51:23,944 --> 01:51:25,904
...but I loved her.

1395
01:51:31,202 --> 01:51:33,362
I love you, Mother.

1396
01:51:40,044 --> 01:51:42,044
I hope so, Deanie.

1397
01:51:52,264 --> 01:51:55,804
You know, it would be nice if children
could be born into this world...

1398
01:51:55,976 --> 01:51:57,966
...with an absolute guarantee...

1399
01:51:58,145 --> 01:52:01,225
...that they were going to have
just the right kind of bringing up...

1400
01:52:01,399 --> 01:52:04,019
...and all lead happy, normal lives.

1401
01:52:05,569 --> 01:52:10,319
But, well, I guess when we get born,
we just all have to take our chances.

1402
01:52:12,284 --> 01:52:13,994
- Mom?
- Hmm?

1403
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:18,411
- Is he married?
- Who?

1404
01:52:18,916 --> 01:52:20,406
Oh.

1405
01:52:20,584 --> 01:52:24,924
Well, to tell you the truth, Deanie,
I don't really know.

1406
01:52:25,089 --> 01:52:26,799
Needn't be afraid of running into him.

1407
01:52:26,966 --> 01:52:28,876
He's living with his mother
down in Tulsa.

1408
01:52:29,051 --> 01:52:31,921
She joined her folks there,
after old Ace killed himself.

1409
01:52:32,096 --> 01:52:34,716
Oh, they say
she's poor as a church mouse.

1410
01:52:34,890 --> 01:52:37,300
And that girl Ginny?
Got killed in a car accident.

1411
01:52:37,476 --> 01:52:42,436
Oh, we all knew something like that
would happen, the way she carried on.

1412
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:48,030
No, now the Stampers
are almost extinct in this town now.

1413
01:52:49,697 --> 01:52:52,367
You know their home
has been turned into a funeral parlor?

1414
01:52:53,200 --> 01:52:54,610
Deanie, Deanie.

1415
01:52:54,785 --> 01:52:56,855
Some of the old gang here
to see you, Deanie.

1416
01:52:57,038 --> 01:53:01,038
- I can't wait to see her.
- It seems simply ages.

1417
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:03,618
How is she, Mr. Loomis?

1418
01:53:05,629 --> 01:53:07,369
She's fine.

1419
01:53:10,301 --> 01:53:12,791
Deanie. How are you?

1420
01:53:20,603 --> 01:53:22,513
June.

1421
01:53:24,148 --> 01:53:26,058
Hazel.

1422
01:53:29,653 --> 01:53:31,733
Come on, you go for a ride with us.

1423
01:53:31,906 --> 01:53:33,946
Give me two minutes
to wash the train off.

1424
01:53:34,116 --> 01:53:35,146
Okay.

1425
01:53:40,498 --> 01:53:44,328
Girls, just one thing.

1426
01:53:45,169 --> 01:53:47,629
Keep her away from Bud Stamper.

1427
01:53:47,797 --> 01:53:50,247
Mrs. Loomis,
she's forgotten about all that.

1428
01:53:50,424 --> 01:53:53,184
- No, no, she hasn't, have some fudge.
- Yeah, thank you.

1429
01:53:53,344 --> 01:53:55,804
The very first thing she did
was ask about him...

1430
01:53:55,971 --> 01:54:00,351
...and then she laid on the bed
and cried and cried.

1431
01:54:00,518 --> 01:54:03,848
Oh, I thought maybe the years away,
she'd forget about him but....

1432
01:54:09,735 --> 01:54:12,225
Now, I want you to promise me.

1433
01:54:12,405 --> 01:54:14,775
The doctors say
she's perfectly all right now...

1434
01:54:14,949 --> 01:54:20,539
...but there's no use in asking for
trouble. Keep her away from him.

1435
01:54:25,918 --> 01:54:30,208
Well, here's our girl.

1436
01:54:32,758 --> 01:54:36,418
Hazel, June.

1437
01:54:37,138 --> 01:54:39,218
I wanna see Bud now.

1438
01:54:39,849 --> 01:54:41,639
Now, honey, you just forget about him.

1439
01:54:41,809 --> 01:54:44,429
Gee, I'm not even sure
where he is now, Deanie.

1440
01:54:44,603 --> 01:54:48,733
I mean, well, no one ever sees him.
Do you know where he is, Hazel?

1441
01:54:49,442 --> 01:54:52,782
He's staying out
at his father's old ranch.

1442
01:55:21,932 --> 01:55:24,012
Deanie, it's
a long way out there.

1443
01:55:24,185 --> 01:55:26,385
I know,
I want to go there, please.

1444
01:55:37,323 --> 01:55:39,613
Clear out of there.

1445
01:55:42,161 --> 01:55:45,201
- Well....
- You want me to go looking for Bud?

1446
01:55:45,373 --> 01:55:47,623
Oh, Hazel, would you?

1447
01:55:57,635 --> 01:55:58,875
Bud?

1448
01:56:01,138 --> 01:56:02,878
Bud?

1449
01:56:03,808 --> 01:56:06,018
He's around back.

1450
01:56:14,694 --> 01:56:16,444
Bud?

1451
01:56:17,571 --> 01:56:20,781
- Oh, June.
- I know.

1452
01:56:22,910 --> 01:56:25,280
- Bud?
- Yeah?

1453
01:56:26,789 --> 01:56:28,619
- Oh, Hazel.
- Hi, Bud.

1454
01:56:28,791 --> 01:56:31,201
- Jeepers, you're a mess.
- Yeah, I been working.

1455
01:56:31,377 --> 01:56:34,077
We got about 40 head of cattle
and we're eating regular--

1456
01:56:34,255 --> 01:56:37,125
Bud, Deanie's out there in the car.

1457
01:56:39,093 --> 01:56:41,763
- Deanie?
- Yeah.

1458
01:56:43,180 --> 01:56:46,020
Oh, gee, I hate to see Deanie
when I'm so dirty.

1459
01:56:46,183 --> 01:56:48,473
She won't mind, Bud.

1460
01:56:55,443 --> 01:56:57,103
Uh, how is she?

1461
01:56:57,278 --> 01:56:59,848
She seems just fine.

1462
01:57:00,781 --> 01:57:02,861
Well, I'm glad.

1463
01:57:08,414 --> 01:57:10,374
Hi, Bud.

1464
01:57:28,893 --> 01:57:30,223
Long time no see.

1465
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:35,229
- A long time.
- It's good to see you, Deanie.

1466
01:57:36,067 --> 01:57:37,887
Thanks, Bud.

1467
01:57:48,621 --> 01:57:50,161
Hey, you wanna meet my family?

1468
01:57:54,752 --> 01:57:56,032
Of course.

1469
01:58:00,299 --> 01:58:01,929
Come on.

1470
01:58:03,052 --> 01:58:04,552
She didn't even know he was married.

1471
01:58:04,720 --> 01:58:06,630
You're her best friend,
why didn't you tell her?

1472
01:58:06,806 --> 01:58:08,516
I just couldn't.

1473
01:58:10,935 --> 01:58:13,595
- Angie?
- Yeah?

1474
01:58:15,731 --> 01:58:17,941
- Angie.
- Yeah?

1475
01:58:18,109 --> 01:58:22,439
Come on out here, honey.
I want you to meet somebody.

1476
01:58:23,781 --> 01:58:24,951
Hello.

1477
01:58:25,116 --> 01:58:28,896
Uh, Angelina, this Deanie.
An old friend of mine.

1478
01:58:29,078 --> 01:58:31,778
Oh. How do you do?

1479
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:37,590
How do you do, Angelina?

1480
01:58:38,796 --> 01:58:39,956
Would you like to come in?

1481
01:58:40,631 --> 01:58:42,791
- Please.
- Well, I....

1482
01:58:44,260 --> 01:58:47,800
- Come on.
- Come on.

1483
01:58:49,974 --> 01:58:51,474
Hungry?

1484
01:58:51,934 --> 01:58:55,434
The house, it doesn't look like much.

1485
01:58:55,604 --> 01:58:59,694
- Maybe I can offer you some wine?
- Thanks, Angelina, but I really can't stay.

1486
01:58:59,942 --> 01:59:03,112
Oh. Uh, this is Bud, Jr.

1487
01:59:03,654 --> 01:59:05,814
The one without the feathers.

1488
01:59:10,369 --> 01:59:11,619
Oh, sure.

1489
01:59:15,791 --> 01:59:18,961
Hello, Bud, Jr. Hello.

1490
01:59:19,128 --> 01:59:22,628
Oh, what a fine boy you are.

1491
01:59:31,307 --> 01:59:35,687
So now we're expecting another child.
I hope it's a girl this time.

1492
01:59:36,854 --> 01:59:38,854
You're a fine boy.

1493
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:48,528
Well, I have to go now.

1494
01:59:49,367 --> 01:59:50,987
You will come back again sometime?

1495
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:55,540
- Will you come back for dinner?
- Thank you, Angelina.

1496
02:00:19,063 --> 02:00:23,193
I married Angie when I left New Haven.

1497
02:00:24,068 --> 02:00:26,858
You know, I didn't even finish
my first year in school there.

1498
02:00:27,029 --> 02:00:28,899
She's real nice.

1499
02:00:29,240 --> 02:00:32,530
She was wonderful to me
when things started to go wrong.

1500
02:00:33,035 --> 02:00:35,155
You're happy, Bud.

1501
02:00:38,791 --> 02:00:40,701
I guess so.

1502
02:00:41,794 --> 02:00:45,004
I don't ask myself that question
very often now.

1503
02:00:47,258 --> 02:00:48,998
How about you?

1504
02:00:50,386 --> 02:00:53,006
- I'm getting married next month.
- Are you, Deanie?

1505
02:00:55,725 --> 02:00:58,095
A boy from Cincinnati.

1506
02:01:00,271 --> 02:01:02,601
I think you might like him.

1507
02:01:08,446 --> 02:01:11,946
Gee, things work out awful funny
sometimes, don't they, Deanie?

1508
02:01:13,200 --> 02:01:15,240
Yes, they do.

1509
02:01:19,498 --> 02:01:21,958
Hope you're gonna be awful happy.

1510
02:01:22,543 --> 02:01:27,503
Well, like you, Bud, I don't think
too much about happiness either.

1511
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:33,380
Aw, what's the point?
You gotta take what comes.

1512
02:01:34,764 --> 02:01:36,394
Yes.

1513
02:01:44,648 --> 02:01:46,138
Well....

1514
02:01:47,401 --> 02:01:49,031
Deanie?

1515
02:02:00,581 --> 02:02:03,251
I'm awful glad to see you again.

1516
02:02:06,504 --> 02:02:08,334
Thanks, Bud.

1517
02:02:09,173 --> 02:02:10,833
Goodbye.

1518
02:02:12,510 --> 02:02:14,090
Bye.

1519
02:02:14,970 --> 02:02:17,260
- June.
- So long, Bud.

1520
02:02:17,640 --> 02:02:19,140
Hello.

1521
02:02:19,308 --> 02:02:21,468
You girls will have to come out
again sometime.

1522
02:02:21,644 --> 02:02:23,854
- You might ask us.
- Oh, I will, I promise.

1523
02:02:24,021 --> 02:02:26,391
Angie and I got a little more money
coming in now...

1524
02:02:26,565 --> 02:02:28,605
...we'll have a big beer party.
She'll call you.

1525
02:02:28,776 --> 02:02:30,516
- It's a date.
- Great.

1526
02:02:32,363 --> 02:02:34,023
<i>Goodbye.</i>

1527
02:02:56,721 --> 02:02:58,551
When do we eat?

1528
02:03:10,776 --> 02:03:14,026
Deanie, honey,
do you think you still love him?

1529
02:03:21,704 --> 02:03:24,914
<i>Though nothing can bring back the hour</i>

1530
02:03:25,082 --> 02:03:29,382
<i>Of splendor in the grass,
Of glory in the flower</i>

1531
02:03:30,629 --> 02:03:33,749
<i>We will grieve not, rather find</i>

1532
02:03:33,924 --> 02:03:37,264
<i>Strength in what remains behind</i>

1533
02:03:42,224 --> 02:03:44,304
