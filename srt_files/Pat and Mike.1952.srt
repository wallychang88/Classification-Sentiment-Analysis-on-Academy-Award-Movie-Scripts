1
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,040
Up off the ground.

2
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:14,582
That's right, pass it high.
Up off the ground.

3
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:18,625
Pass it high.

4
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:22,800
Sal. Take over, will you?

5
00:02:41,992 --> 00:02:45,443
- Hey, I was just looking for you up there.
- I came out by the front.

6
00:02:45,662 --> 00:02:48,070
- Well, you're pretty daring.
- It's perfectly legal.

7
00:02:48,248 --> 00:02:51,582
I just looked it up. A man's allowed
to kiss any girl he's engaged to.

8
00:02:51,752 --> 00:02:53,993
Hey, you're not gonna wear
those pants?

9
00:02:54,171 --> 00:02:56,543
Not pants. They're slacks.
Watch your language.

10
00:02:56,758 --> 00:02:59,427
Look. We got
a pretty delicate deal here.

11
00:02:59,594 --> 00:03:02,002
This game isn't so much pleasure,
more business.

12
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,219
And I don't want anything
to go flooey.

13
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:07,842
They're pretty conservative people,
these Bemingers, and...

14
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:14,190
- It's too late now. Come on, let's go.
- No, no, wait. Wait.

15
00:03:24,202 --> 00:03:25,946
Go.

16
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:33,376
Oh, mister, the things
I've done for this school.

17
00:03:33,545 --> 00:03:36,250
This time it's worth it, honey.
Beminger's good and ripe.

18
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:37,751
For what?

19
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:39,882
Biggest donation
I've gotten all year.

20
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:44,180
- Hooray for our side.
- Your side especially.

21
00:03:44,348 --> 00:03:46,921
He's really serious
about building us that new gym.

22
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,307
How fascinating.

23
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:56,431
Now, all we've got to do
is the right thing and say it.

24
00:03:56,652 --> 00:03:59,273
- At your service.
- Well, number one, it's he and you...

25
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:01,818
...against Mrs. Beminger and me.
- Yes, sir.

26
00:04:02,032 --> 00:04:06,030
I could make it look pretty good
and lose, but Mrs. Beminger's a whiz.

27
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:08,492
- Do or die, that's me.
- Just see that you win.

28
00:04:08,664 --> 00:04:12,448
- Yes, sir. Do my best.
- Let's not blow this.

29
00:04:12,668 --> 00:04:14,910
Yeah, yeah, do my best.

30
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:17,999
Just watch me.
I'll tell you what to do...

31
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:20,380
...and then let's hope
you can do it.

32
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,425
- Thanks.
- What?

33
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,923
Nothing.

34
00:04:24,096 --> 00:04:27,679
Well, give us a kiss, honey.
I'm nervous as a cat.

35
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,453
- Good afternoon. Good afternoon.
- Hi.

36
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,583
- How are you, Mrs. Beminger?
- Quite well, thank you.

37
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,341
- Hi.
- Come on, Collier, let's go.

38
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,178
- Eighteen holes is a lot of holes.
- All set.

39
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,836
Say, that's quite a swing
you've got there, Mrs. B.

40
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,557
What do you say, Ma?

41
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,436
I say:

42
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,680
- After you, dear. Okay, Mr. B?
- Yeah.

43
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:16,481
- Go ahead.
- Got a tee, Coll?

44
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,979
Yeah.

45
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:22,186
Now, don't let me down, now.
Let's see the good one.

46
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,084
Oh, too bad.

47
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:41,548
You've got to tense
the gluteal muscles, dear.

48
00:05:41,717 --> 00:05:44,291
If you don't tense
the gluteal muscles...

49
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,922
...why, your whole alignment is off.
- You want me to get you a soapbox?

50
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:49,510
- Play your cards.
- What?

51
00:05:49,684 --> 00:05:51,059
Tee off.

52
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,552
Thank you, lady.
Thank you very much.

53
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:56,565
I wouldn't have known what to do
if you hadn't told me.

54
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,275
Thank you.

55
00:06:03,364 --> 00:06:05,855
Oh, tense the gluteal muscles,
did you say?

56
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,034
Yes. That's right.

57
00:06:08,204 --> 00:06:09,318
Tense.

58
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:16,537
Well, I see what you mean.
Makes all the difference.

59
00:06:16,712 --> 00:06:18,669
- It does.
- All.

60
00:06:20,967 --> 00:06:23,292
Gotta tense. Tense.

61
00:06:57,295 --> 00:07:00,664
Well, for heaven's sake,
I know, don't I?

62
00:07:10,558 --> 00:07:12,183
Beauty.

63
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:16,852
Take your time, partner.

64
00:07:17,315 --> 00:07:19,438
It's all up to you now, don't forget.

65
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:21,566
Quiet, do you mind?

66
00:07:46,721 --> 00:07:48,797
My dear, if you would
lean your weight...

67
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:50,931
...on your right foot, the way I do...

68
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:53,224
Take into consideration
an endowment...

69
00:07:53,395 --> 00:07:55,102
...that has some permanent value.

70
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:57,679
What is the concrete thing
that you can point to...

71
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,146
...in the years to come with...?

72
00:08:04,322 --> 00:08:05,864
So all I can say is to...

73
00:08:06,074 --> 00:08:09,158
...consider that every time
you look up at that building...

74
00:08:09,327 --> 00:08:12,531
...you're in a position
to point with pride and...

75
00:08:12,706 --> 00:08:15,161
- that you'll find it is
to develop your reflexes.

76
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:18,500
Yes, you've got to learn to relax.
To give in.

77
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,707
We can settle this some other time.

78
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:27,259
- Forty, 60. Come here, boy.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:29,920
- Split that up.
- How about a nice, tall, cool one?

80
00:08:30,098 --> 00:08:31,758
I'll take mine in the locker room.

81
00:08:31,934 --> 00:08:33,594
See you in 20 minutes
in the lounge.

82
00:08:33,769 --> 00:08:36,342
The one thing he can't stand,
Mr. B, is to lose.

83
00:08:36,522 --> 00:08:39,476
With him, it's not the principle
of the thing, it's the money.

84
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,651
You know, dear, where you go bad
is your coordination.

85
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,311
Now, that is your story, coordination.

86
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:49,107
This and this and this should
all be parts of the same thing.

87
00:08:49,284 --> 00:08:51,361
If you could possibly lift the needle...

88
00:08:51,537 --> 00:08:54,372
...from that long-playing phonograph
you keep in your face.

89
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,292
Why, the very...

90
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:07,759
Watch this. Will you excuse me?

91
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:26,943
You know what you can do
with your gluteal muscle?

92
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:29,108
Give it away for Christmas.

93
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,872
Say, wait, wait here.
Wait a moment.

94
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:40,459
Sit down, Mrs. Pemberton,
sit down.

95
00:09:40,629 --> 00:09:42,788
- What will you have to drink?
- Plenty.

96
00:09:42,965 --> 00:09:45,835
- Lemonade?
- Why not?

97
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,172
- Right.
- Strong. Plenty of lemon.

98
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:52,466
- What do I care?
- All right. Plenty of lemon.

99
00:09:52,641 --> 00:09:55,726
And another thing.
Don't call me Mrs. Pemberton.

100
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,686
- No?
- Pat, that's me.

101
00:09:57,855 --> 00:09:59,764
Okay. I'll call you Pat.

102
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,356
- I want everybody to from now on.
- Why?

103
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:06,107
Friendless. That's how I feel.

104
00:10:06,322 --> 00:10:10,818
I feel the whole world's against me,
and vice versa.

105
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:12,950
Did you ever feel that way, Charlie?

106
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,030
Every time I miss a shot.

107
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,121
There you are.

108
00:10:17,875 --> 00:10:19,868
You've been golfing here
for quite a while.

109
00:10:20,044 --> 00:10:21,953
- Quite.
- Then how come I never saw it?

110
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,837
Saw what?

111
00:10:24,006 --> 00:10:25,584
- You're great.
- I must be.

112
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:27,834
- A natural.
- Fairly seldom.

113
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,466
- What's your handicap?
- My fella.

114
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:32,963
I mean on the board.

115
00:10:33,725 --> 00:10:35,516
- Six.
- You ought to be two.

116
00:10:35,685 --> 00:10:39,101
- I wish I were a two.
- You know what I'd like to do with you?

117
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:41,763
Enter you in the Women's National.

118
00:10:42,191 --> 00:10:44,398
- Oh, no.
- Listen, if I don't know a champ...

119
00:10:44,569 --> 00:10:47,060
...when I see one, what good am I?

120
00:10:47,238 --> 00:10:49,278
- Oh, I haven't the time.
- We'll make it.

121
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:51,109
We'll coach hard the next 15 days.

122
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,321
We'll get out there, you qualify,
you play and you win.

123
00:10:54,497 --> 00:10:56,573
No. I can't play golf.
I can't do anything...

124
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:59,999
- But what about out there? I saw...
- That was because I got mad. Mad.

125
00:11:00,169 --> 00:11:02,162
- Well, we'll keep you mad.
- No, you see...

126
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:03,998
...I only play with Collier Weld.

127
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:06,415
And I can't do anything
when he's watching me.

128
00:11:06,592 --> 00:11:10,044
- Listen, a chance like this...
- Give me Mrs. Beminger's money.

129
00:11:12,515 --> 00:11:14,306
Do you mind, Charlie?

130
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:17,593
- I thought you wanted to help me.
- I tried to.

131
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,763
To what?
Jam me up with the biggest donor...

132
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,145
- I didn't mean to.
- Pat, I'm trying understand.

133
00:11:22,316 --> 00:11:24,060
How could you,
when I don't myself.

134
00:11:24,235 --> 00:11:26,560
- You don't what?
- Anything. Understand.

135
00:11:26,738 --> 00:11:29,692
Why it is I fall to pieces
whenever you give me that look.

136
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:31,905
- What look?
- This look.

137
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,904
- That's me?
- Sure.

138
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,569
Makes me feel you don't believe in me
and never will.

139
00:11:36,748 --> 00:11:39,749
- You're just overwrought.
- And you're just overpowering.

140
00:11:39,918 --> 00:11:42,491
- Now, let's not squabble, huh?
- Okay!

141
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:45,287
I'll see if I can square things
with the Bemingers.

142
00:11:45,465 --> 00:11:47,292
Why try?

143
00:11:48,009 --> 00:11:49,338
Face it, Pat. He's a power.

144
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:51,966
He's out there screaming
about firing you.

145
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,590
- He couldn't.
- Why not?

146
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,509
- Because I've quit.
- When?

147
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:59,721
- Right now.
- Oh, no.

148
00:11:59,896 --> 00:12:03,846
- Well, this is no place to talk now.
- Okay, later.

149
00:12:05,861 --> 00:12:09,064
Don't get frazzled, dear.
Don't get frazzled.

150
00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:16,826
Everybody frazzles everybody...

151
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:19,570
...then they turn around
and tell them, "Don't be."

152
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,292
What?

153
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:24,577
That true, Charlie?

154
00:12:24,755 --> 00:12:26,249
What's true?

155
00:12:26,423 --> 00:12:28,831
What you think I could do?

156
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:32,635
Scout's honor.

157
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,182
- All right, then.
- Great.

158
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:37,893
I'll show her.

159
00:12:38,061 --> 00:12:40,267
- Show who?
- Show myself, that's who.

160
00:12:40,438 --> 00:12:43,558
That's right. Because you know how
to not get yourself frazzled?

161
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:45,192
Get unfrazzled.

162
00:12:56,204 --> 00:12:58,363
<i>Nearly all of the 60 girls
who have entered...</i>

163
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,283
<i>...have turned in their scorecards.</i>

164
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:04,159
<i>Let me repeat, ladies and gentlemen,
only the 16 best will be eligible...</i>

165
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:07,333
<i>...to compete for match play,
which begins tomorrow.</i>

166
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:10,343
<i>Your attention, ladies and gentlemen,
we have another score.</i>

167
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:15,629
Mrs. Patricia Pemberton
has just qualified with a sparkling 77.

168
00:13:29,154 --> 00:13:32,239
<i>That, ladies and gentlemen,
leaves one contender still to be...</i>

169
00:13:32,408 --> 00:13:34,946
<i>Yes, here she comes now,
the mighty Babe.</i>

170
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,454
<i>We'll have her score for you
in just a second. Here it is now.</i>

171
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,662
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the top score of the day.</i>

172
00:13:42,835 --> 00:13:45,373
<i>Mrs. Babe Didrikson Zaharias
has just qualified...</i>

173
00:13:45,546 --> 00:13:48,037
<i>...with a sensational 73.</i>

174
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:49,923
Now, fellas, here's the rundown.

175
00:13:50,092 --> 00:13:52,583
From left to right,
Beverly Hanson, Babe Zaharias...

176
00:13:52,762 --> 00:13:55,881
...Helen Dettweiler,
Betty Hicks, Mary Lorgan...

177
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:58,630
...Harriet Salter
and Mrs. Patricia Pemberton.

178
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:05,037
- Don't be scared, lady.
- What is this, anyway?

179
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:07,744
Sit down. Come over here
and sit down. Take it easy.

180
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:11,167
I never like to see an athlete
wear hisself out. Or herself.

181
00:15:11,342 --> 00:15:14,711
- Lf this is a holdup or a robbery...
- We didn't come to be insulted.

182
00:15:14,887 --> 00:15:16,216
- Take it easy.
- Tell her.

183
00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:17,848
- Identify ourselves.
- Sit down.

184
00:15:18,016 --> 00:15:19,842
You've been on your feet
the whole day.

185
00:15:20,018 --> 00:15:22,057
Why don't you sit down
and take it easy.

186
00:15:23,563 --> 00:15:27,062
Mrs. Pemberton, I'd like to
introduce myself. Mike Conovan.

187
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:29,356
And my associate, Barney Grau.

188
00:15:29,527 --> 00:15:31,187
- Pleasure.
- Take a chair, Barney.

189
00:15:31,362 --> 00:15:32,691
Thank you.

190
00:15:33,406 --> 00:15:37,404
I have been watching you
like eagle eye the last couple of days.

191
00:15:37,577 --> 00:15:42,121
And I'm here to tell you, you are
one beautiful thing to watch. In action.

192
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:45,126
I've been in this sports racket
as long as I can remember...

193
00:15:45,336 --> 00:15:48,337
...and I'm here to say,
you are what I call, no doubt, fast.

194
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:49,834
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

195
00:15:50,007 --> 00:15:52,083
Let me ask you
a plain statement of fact.

196
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,718
You figure to win this?

197
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,962
- So does everybody.
- Never mind everybody.

198
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:58,843
Let's concentrate on you
for an instance.

199
00:15:59,016 --> 00:16:01,554
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

200
00:16:01,853 --> 00:16:05,802
Tell me, off the record,
what's your pitch?

201
00:16:05,982 --> 00:16:08,817
- Well, I don't quite understand what...
- What is it with you?

202
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:11,986
Is it business, pleasure?
You wanna get a picture in the paper?

203
00:16:12,155 --> 00:16:14,990
- I'm coming to that. I think...
- I really don't know what...

204
00:16:15,158 --> 00:16:18,361
Figure it out, honey.
You're a cinch to win this, you know.

205
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:20,612
You can't miss copping
this thing in a walk.

206
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:23,326
- Without someone dismantles you.
- Oh, I don't know.

207
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,991
You're not supposed to know.
You're supposed to play.

208
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,541
I'm supposed to know, and I do.

209
00:16:29,255 --> 00:16:30,666
Tell me...

210
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:33,124
How smart are you, anyway?

211
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:35,875
Very, in some things.

212
00:16:36,054 --> 00:16:38,426
How's about money?
What kind of a thing is that?

213
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:43,474
- Not very.
- Oh, that's too bad. That's too bad.

214
00:16:43,645 --> 00:16:46,646
Because I got a way for you
to stash away a roll, surprise you.

215
00:16:46,815 --> 00:16:48,642
I'd like that.

216
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:50,646
You would?

217
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:53,900
How would you like
to come in second?

218
00:16:56,992 --> 00:16:59,827
- I wouldn't.
- A square, like I figured.

219
00:16:59,995 --> 00:17:02,568
That's too bad. That's too bad.

220
00:17:02,748 --> 00:17:05,239
You come in second,
you could do very good in money.

221
00:17:05,417 --> 00:17:08,252
Come in first, you get a cup.
It's too big to drink out of.

222
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,456
- I think you'd better get out.
- Mention a number. Think it over.

223
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,042
Here, this is me.

224
00:17:13,217 --> 00:17:15,505
In New York, strictly legitimate
and well known.

225
00:17:15,678 --> 00:17:18,086
I own and operate Davie Hucko.

226
00:17:18,598 --> 00:17:21,718
- Davie Hucko, mean anything?
- No.

227
00:17:25,063 --> 00:17:27,471
- No.
- Heavyweight champion of the world...

228
00:17:27,649 --> 00:17:30,140
...in a couple of years.
Now to get back to you.

229
00:17:30,318 --> 00:17:32,275
The only thing you gotta do
is to lose...

230
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,363
...and our only problem is gonna be
to find bushel baskets...

231
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,192
...to carry the stuff away.

232
00:17:37,492 --> 00:17:38,821
- Yes?
- Room service.

233
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:40,322
Just a minute.

234
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:43,366
Whether you do or whether
you don't, I gotta tell you this:

235
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,119
You're a beautiful thing to watch.
In action.

236
00:18:01,808 --> 00:18:05,178
Your opinion. How many do you think
you'd find honest out of 100?

237
00:18:05,354 --> 00:18:06,682
Two on an average.

238
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:09,055
- I'd say three.
- All right, three.

239
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:13,147
Too bad she couldn't be one of the 97
instead of one of the three.

240
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,651
What a beautiful buck
we could've made with her.

241
00:18:15,823 --> 00:18:17,946
- Maybe she'll change her mind.
- Not a chance.

242
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,445
- How you sure?
- See her face?

243
00:18:19,618 --> 00:18:20,947
- Yeah.
- A real honest face.

244
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,370
- Yeah.
- The only disgusting thing about her.

245
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,663
<i>We're having magnificent weather
for the opening day...</i>

246
00:18:28,878 --> 00:18:31,285
<i>...of the Women 's National
Match Play Championship.</i>

247
00:18:31,464 --> 00:18:34,963
<i>And the last twosome, Miss Betty Hicks
and Mrs. Patricia Pemberton...</i>

248
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:36,758
<i>...will tee off in just a moment.</i>

249
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:39,804
We'd like to remind you
that today is only the first day...

250
00:18:39,972 --> 00:18:41,799
...of four days of tournament play.

251
00:18:42,016 --> 00:18:46,144
<i>And tomorrow's quarterfinal round
will begin promptly at 10:00.</i>

252
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:50,221
On the tee now, Betty Hicks.

253
00:19:07,459 --> 00:19:11,587
On the tee now, Patricia Pemberton.

254
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:47,326
Another bull's-eye.
Some straight shooter, this kid.

255
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,745
Yeah, that's our trouble.

256
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:05,267
This is the third twosome.

257
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:08,810
<i>Pemberton 's still four up over Hicks.</i>

258
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:24,113
- She's picking it up.
- Don't waste the shot, Pat!

259
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:26,868
Give me the wedge, will you?

260
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,876
I guess they all want
to see me take a shower.

261
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:43,886
The pressure gets greater and greater.
Today, with only four contestants left...

262
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:48,637
...we find we have three favorites
and one rank outsider still battling it out.

263
00:21:04,996 --> 00:21:08,745
Beautiful shot, Bev. Beautiful.

264
00:22:01,303 --> 00:22:02,763
Gee, Pat, that's a rough shot.

265
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:27,329
Today is payoff day.

266
00:22:27,497 --> 00:22:30,831
Payoff day for one of these two girls
who have battled to the ranks...

267
00:22:31,001 --> 00:22:35,164
...of America's top women golfers to
meet for the National Match Play Crown.

268
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:39,206
We won't hazard a guess as to which
of the girls will be the eventual winner.

269
00:23:03,659 --> 00:23:07,242
Into the 16th,
Pemberton's still one up on Zaharias.

270
00:23:37,653 --> 00:23:41,864
- I think I'll try a 3 here. Well...
- A little long for this hole.

271
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,429
Pemberton overshot the 17th.
Zaharias well-placed on the green.

272
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:44,049
Give me that wedge.

273
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:21,258
Zaharias won the 17th.
All even. Going to 18th.

274
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:05,795
You're out of it.

275
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:20,065
- Mike. Mike.
- I ain't in.

276
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,228
You think she could've
not understood you?

277
00:26:22,404 --> 00:26:24,977
- Or misunderstood you?
- I'm trying to catch her eyes.

278
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:26,485
I'll settle for one eye.

279
00:26:26,658 --> 00:26:29,066
If our signals got mixed,
I'm gonna cut off my arm.

280
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:31,367
You may have to,
if we're gonna eat tomorrow.

281
00:26:37,085 --> 00:26:39,327
What happened? What happened?

282
00:26:39,505 --> 00:26:42,541
Nothing good.
The Babe is on the green.

283
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:51,225
<i>Clear the fairway, please.</i>

284
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:21,584
The Pemberton ball.

285
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:23,915
The Zaharias ball.

286
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:29,585
This match is all square
and this is the final hole.

287
00:29:30,513 --> 00:29:33,882
- Hello. Oh, hello.
- Was that on purpose or what?

288
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:36,466
- Or what.
- I'm glad to hear that, at least.

289
00:29:36,644 --> 00:29:38,601
You see what happened anyway?

290
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:41,263
If you'd have been willing
to happen it on purpose...

291
00:29:41,441 --> 00:29:44,193
...you could've been walking out
with a bushel basket.

292
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,231
- Like I said, it just goes to show.
- It certainly does.

293
00:29:47,405 --> 00:29:49,398
Well, I still think you
got possibilities.

294
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:51,234
- Thanks.
- You got my business card?

295
00:29:51,409 --> 00:29:53,817
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. Get in touch with me.

296
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:57,447
There's a nice dollar laying around
waiting for you and I to pick it up.

297
00:29:57,624 --> 00:30:00,661
- I'm afraid I'm not...
- I mean legitimate, you know.

298
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,371
Lady athlete, properly handled.
Always a market.

299
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:07,164
I don't think you've ever been
properly handled.

300
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:10,712
That's right. Not even by myself.

301
00:30:12,098 --> 00:30:14,506
Very few brains.

302
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:17,887
- Yeah. There's one thing I gotta say.
- What?

303
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:21,562
- Nicely packed, that kid.
- She is at that.

304
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:24,687
Not much meat on her,
but what's there is choice.

305
00:30:25,862 --> 00:30:28,614
Well, here we are. These two.

306
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:30,864
Here you go, porter.

307
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,279
- Well, off we go.
- Off we go.

308
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:41,375
- Feel any better?
- Well, no.

309
00:30:41,544 --> 00:30:43,204
This too will pass away.

310
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,705
- Hey, who said that?
- I don't know.

311
00:30:45,882 --> 00:30:48,800
How about looking at the bright side
of this, for instance?

312
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:51,673
Now, take this.
As long as your job's out of the way...

313
00:30:51,846 --> 00:30:54,005
...we move our date up.
Tie the old knot.

314
00:30:54,224 --> 00:30:56,976
I think you've worked long enough,
done enough, don't you?

315
00:30:57,143 --> 00:30:59,053
- Too much.
- What are you trying to prove?

316
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:01,518
- Who you trying to lick?
- Myself.

317
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:04,181
You're just the kid who can do it.

318
00:31:05,318 --> 00:31:08,569
Collier, do you sort of...?
I don't think you mean to...

319
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:11,490
...but do you think of me
as just a little woman?

320
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:14,861
That's right.
And myself as a little man.

321
00:31:15,037 --> 00:31:16,780
Right now, l...

322
00:31:16,955 --> 00:31:19,873
I feel sort of like a flop
that you're rescuing.

323
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,951
I'm flummoxed, that's what I am.

324
00:31:22,169 --> 00:31:26,582
Maybe we ought to wait until
I don't feel so carved up, so nobody.

325
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,875
Why don't you just let me take charge.

326
00:31:29,051 --> 00:31:32,087
- I have to be in charge of myself.
- But what's the good of this?

327
00:31:32,262 --> 00:31:33,887
- I mean, after all, we...
- Board!

328
00:31:34,056 --> 00:31:36,050
Have to have time
to think it over, is all.

329
00:31:36,226 --> 00:31:38,895
Well, just see that you don't
think it under.

330
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:42,182
It's a nice long ride.
Just take your time.

331
00:31:45,735 --> 00:31:47,111
That's right.

332
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,070
- And I'm not going to take it.
- Hey!

333
00:31:49,239 --> 00:31:51,362
- I can't, that's all.
- Can't what?

334
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:54,653
Go back. Not this way.
What's there to go back to?

335
00:31:54,828 --> 00:31:56,488
Don't you think you're just being...?

336
00:31:56,705 --> 00:32:00,156
I've got to prove to you, to myself...
Lend me some money, will you?

337
00:32:00,334 --> 00:32:02,410
- Prove to both of us,
in fact, everybody...

338
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:05,207
...that I'm not just a big...
- Say, Pat.

339
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,248
Pat, wait a second, will you?
I'm coming along too.

340
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,715
- No, please don't.
- You can't get off now, lady.

341
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:13,678
Watch me.

342
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,033
Ruby, let me get
a word in edgeways, will you?

343
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,704
Ruby, win, lose or draw...

344
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,912
...when did Hucko
ever not give you action?

345
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:48,207
Now, you know yourself
as well as I know myself...

346
00:32:48,382 --> 00:32:50,956
...that that's what they pay for,
is action.

347
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,795
Yeah, Rub.

348
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:56,754
Even when he gets flattened,
he does it noisy, don't he?

349
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:01,009
Right. Let me know, huh, Ruby?
Right, boy, bye.

350
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:05,806
- What did you weigh today?
- Ninety-eight. Up 2.

351
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:08,272
- Why up 2? Did you eat extra?
- No, no, honest.

352
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,604
Let him talk himself, will you?

353
00:33:10,823 --> 00:33:12,946
- No, no, honest.
- What's the matter with you?

354
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,901
- Where's the control?
- I thought it could be he's still growing.

355
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,703
You'll be growing in Central Park,
the two of youse...

356
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,075
...if you don't watch out.

357
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,250
- Have another beer?
- No thanks, no more.

358
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:32,917
- You see that?
- Davie, what are you doing to me?

359
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:35,467
- Nervous, thirsty.
- Water.

360
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,762
Did you ever hear of water?

361
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,807
Well, why don't you drink water?

362
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:41,886
- Ashamed.
- You're what?

363
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:44,139
Nervous, thirsty.
I go in the place.

364
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:48,811
I'm ashamed to ask for free water.
Took one beer.

365
00:33:49,737 --> 00:33:51,196
Yeah.

366
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:52,692
- Did you like it?
- Yeah.

367
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,241
- What?
- No.

368
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:58,358
Well, Hucko, I guess it's time to ask you
the three questions, ain't it?

369
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,281
Are you ready?

370
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:02,999
- Who made you, Hucko?
- You.

371
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:05,076
- Who owns the biggest piece of you?
- You.

372
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,789
What will happen if I drop you?

373
00:34:06,963 --> 00:34:08,790
- I go right down the drain, Mike.
- And?

374
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,041
- And stay there.
- Who made you?

375
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,546
- You, Mike.
- Who owns you?

376
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,047
- You.
- Lf I drop you?

377
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,928
- Go right down the drain, Mike.
- And?

378
00:34:16,097 --> 00:34:18,220
- And stay there.
- Take him back to the gym.

379
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,099
- We just come from.
- Go on back from.

380
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,593
And don't let him out
until he's back to 96 even.

381
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:26,768
He's liable to go on Friday. We can't
have him overweight. Get going.

382
00:34:28,568 --> 00:34:31,189
I'll shake it when
it don't weigh so much.

383
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:36,951
We ought to enter him
in the sixth race next Saturday...

384
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:39,491
...if Little Nell's leg don't unstiffen.

385
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,617
What are you, a comedian?
An agent down the hall handles them.

386
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,997
- What about that leg?
- Loosening by the minute.

387
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:46,794
- What about her starts?
- Too slow.

388
00:34:46,963 --> 00:34:49,798
- I think she feels depressed.
- She feels depressed, huh?

389
00:34:49,966 --> 00:34:52,124
She's gonna feel
a good boring of a needle...

390
00:34:52,301 --> 00:34:54,590
...if she don't get going,
I'll tell you that.

391
00:34:55,012 --> 00:34:56,637
I'm getting...

392
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:01,675
Oh, no.

393
00:35:01,853 --> 00:35:05,269
Come in. Well, well, who'd...?

394
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:07,889
Swing her around
and phone me the time. Goodbye.

395
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:11,851
- Sit down.
- Well, hello. Who'd have believed this?

396
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:15,280
- Well, I'm upside down with surprise.
- Why?

397
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,110
What can I do for you?

398
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:19,236
- Well, I came to ask you.
- Me? What?

399
00:35:19,412 --> 00:35:22,579
- What you can do for me.
- What'd you have in mind?

400
00:35:22,749 --> 00:35:26,200
Well, you said something
about a bushel basket.

401
00:35:26,378 --> 00:35:29,414
Oh, yes, sure, I remember.

402
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:31,249
Well...

403
00:35:31,424 --> 00:35:35,422
Well, now, let's start off
with a few statistics or two.

404
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,093
How much would you say
the people in the U.S. A...

405
00:35:38,265 --> 00:35:41,052
...spend on sports a year,
total amount?

406
00:35:41,226 --> 00:35:42,554
No idea.

407
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:45,645
- Surprise you if I said 150 million?
- Yes.

408
00:35:45,814 --> 00:35:47,972
Well, it's 300 million.

409
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,557
And some of it belongs to us by rights.

410
00:35:50,736 --> 00:35:52,313
- How do you like that?
- My.

411
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:55,275
You see, it's all built up
around personalities, see...

412
00:35:55,449 --> 00:35:57,157
...which I figure you may be one of.

413
00:35:57,326 --> 00:36:01,240
I can't be sure of that, but the way
things look to me, I think so.

414
00:36:01,413 --> 00:36:03,869
- All right.
- Now, of course, what you need is:

415
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:07,492
A, a manager.
B, a promoter.

416
00:36:07,711 --> 00:36:09,834
- And that's me, A and B.
- All right.

417
00:36:10,005 --> 00:36:12,757
The first thing, you would
have to turn pro. Is that okay?

418
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:15,842
- Okay. Okay. My...?
- All right with your husband?

419
00:36:16,095 --> 00:36:18,716
Mrs. Pat Pemberton,
ain't that how they introduced you?

420
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:22,010
- I'm a widow.
- What kind? Merry?

421
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:24,594
Settle down, will you?

422
00:36:25,397 --> 00:36:27,224
All right, so now you're a pro.

423
00:36:27,399 --> 00:36:29,890
Of course, we gotta go out
and find the competitions.

424
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,862
Trouble is, this time of the year,
they're far in between.

425
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:35,865
Aren't there other things?
I mean, not golf.

426
00:36:36,032 --> 00:36:38,737
- What do you mean, other things?
- Other sports?

427
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:42,531
- You do other sports?
- I've only played golf for a year or so.

428
00:36:42,706 --> 00:36:45,707
- That's all?
- Yes, my beau asked me to take it up.

429
00:36:45,876 --> 00:36:49,079
What is this beau deal?
What's that?

430
00:36:50,881 --> 00:36:54,332
If we're gonna be partners, I'd kind of
like to know what the layout is.

431
00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:57,214
- Where is your beau?
- California.

432
00:36:57,387 --> 00:36:59,629
- Live there? Work there?
- Pacific Tech.

433
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:02,380
Oh, this is all right with him?
This whole switch.

434
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:06,639
- No. That is, yes, yes.
- Wait a minute, don't go so fast.

435
00:37:06,855 --> 00:37:09,690
You see, if we're partners,
we'd be on kind of a schedule.

436
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:11,851
I don't know how often
or how many times...

437
00:37:12,027 --> 00:37:14,435
...we could get
to be around California.

438
00:37:14,613 --> 00:37:17,283
That would be all right,
for the moment.

439
00:37:18,867 --> 00:37:20,112
Yeah.

440
00:37:20,286 --> 00:37:23,820
I see.
Now, what other sports?

441
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:26,413
Well, tennis.

442
00:37:26,584 --> 00:37:28,872
That's number one.
I'm really good at that.

443
00:37:29,044 --> 00:37:31,536
- You're better than with the sticks?
- Oh, yes. Much.

444
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:33,956
And then, of course,
the usual shooting.

445
00:37:34,175 --> 00:37:36,167
- Shoot?
- Well, you know.

446
00:37:36,344 --> 00:37:39,261
Skeet, range and some archery.

447
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:41,802
- Say, you're...
- Ice hockey, basketball...

448
00:37:42,058 --> 00:37:46,684
...and a little baseball.
- Where did you play baseball?

449
00:37:46,896 --> 00:37:49,565
Pacific Tech.
I was there several years.

450
00:37:49,774 --> 00:37:51,565
What's the matter?
You couldn't pass?

451
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,944
No. I was faculty.

452
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:57,779
That's like a teacher.

453
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,325
Well, ain't it?

454
00:37:59,493 --> 00:38:02,031
You're not, by some chance, a boxer?

455
00:38:02,746 --> 00:38:04,324
Just 16-ounce gloves, I'm afraid.

456
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:07,701
- Eights have a tendency to...
- That's all, honey. That's all.

457
00:38:07,876 --> 00:38:09,786
Say no more.

458
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:16,384
Of course, there's always a chance that
you could be an escaped fruitcake.

459
00:38:16,552 --> 00:38:20,466
But if there is something, as a matter
of fact, anything in what you say...

460
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,309
...I am going to promote you
into the king of the world.

461
00:38:23,476 --> 00:38:24,804
Queen, I mean. Let's go.

462
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,778
Would you like to see me
serve a few, Mr. Conovan?

463
00:38:34,153 --> 00:38:36,609
Oh, no, no. Just hit a couple.

464
00:39:32,547 --> 00:39:35,797
- Got to be notary public, don't it?
- Take care of that, don't worry.

465
00:39:35,967 --> 00:39:37,627
We ought to have a glass for luck.

466
00:39:37,802 --> 00:39:39,462
What do you mean, a glass for luck?

467
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,885
What am I, some kind
of an acey-deucey gambler?

468
00:39:42,056 --> 00:39:45,390
Us two bumping into each other,
that's all the luck any man deserves.

469
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,181
From now on, it's hard work
and promotion and so forth.

470
00:39:48,354 --> 00:39:50,892
- And promotion.
- Okay, I'll get these back to you.

471
00:39:51,065 --> 00:39:52,809
- And yours too, miss.
- Thank you.

472
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:56,062
- So let's go.
- I'd like a martini, please. Very, very dry.

473
00:39:56,237 --> 00:39:58,230
- Very, very nothing. Cancel that.
- What?

474
00:39:58,406 --> 00:39:59,735
- Beer, beer.
- Beer, beer.

475
00:39:59,949 --> 00:40:02,322
- Corned beef, Swiss on rye.
- Corned beef.

476
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:04,036
- I'll have beef stew.
- Same.

477
00:40:04,245 --> 00:40:06,783
- And for the lady?
- Oh, a small steak, rare.

478
00:40:06,956 --> 00:40:08,285
- Medium.
- Rare, rare, rare...

479
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,285
...and a baked potato
and some spinach.

480
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,251
- Coffee?
- Yeah, yeah, coffee.

481
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,128
- Yes, please, large.
- No, no, milk.

482
00:40:14,297 --> 00:40:17,215
- Please, will you, I'm a busy man.
- Two coffees and one milk.

483
00:40:17,384 --> 00:40:20,088
Everybody keeps having to change
one another's minds.

484
00:40:20,262 --> 00:40:23,547
Took a whole half an hour for one...
Could be here for...

485
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:25,716
- What's the matter?
- Who's talking to you?

486
00:40:25,892 --> 00:40:28,430
- Who, then?
- Myself. Mind if I talk to myself?

487
00:40:29,688 --> 00:40:31,312
I'd like a martini, please.

488
00:40:31,481 --> 00:40:34,518
Look, girlie, do me a favor,
don't be hard to handle, will you?

489
00:40:34,693 --> 00:40:36,602
It's gonna be hard enough
if you're easy.

490
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:38,937
- I don't see what right...
- Read your contract.

491
00:40:39,114 --> 00:40:41,237
- What? Just silly.
- Training clause.

492
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:44,077
Well, that's not for you
to decide, you know.

493
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:48,236
- I have to watch your shape.
- There's nothing wrong with my...

494
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,538
- What shape are you talking about?
- What shape are you talking about?

495
00:40:52,711 --> 00:40:55,083
I'm in perfect condition,
if that's what you mean.

496
00:40:55,255 --> 00:40:56,833
Good. Let's keep you that way.

497
00:40:57,007 --> 00:40:59,130
- We got a long way to go.
- I must say.

498
00:40:59,301 --> 00:41:02,338
Oh, now, now.
Don't race your motor.

499
00:41:09,437 --> 00:41:11,229
- What is this?
- What?

500
00:41:11,398 --> 00:41:12,892
What, you trying to needle me?

501
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:15,853
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- There's a sign, "No smoking."

502
00:41:16,027 --> 00:41:18,565
- Where?
- I just put it up inside your head.

503
00:41:18,738 --> 00:41:21,312
- See, the point of...
- What?

504
00:41:22,576 --> 00:41:25,612
What's to prevent me smoking
when you're not around?

505
00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:27,869
When am I not around?

506
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,037
Well, you don't expect
to be watching me every minute...

507
00:41:33,086 --> 00:41:36,751
...out of every 24 hours...

508
00:41:36,924 --> 00:41:39,497
...out of every day, do you?

509
00:41:39,927 --> 00:41:42,797
- Lf I have to, sure.
- Not sure I'll like that.

510
00:41:42,971 --> 00:41:44,631
Not asking you to like it.

511
00:41:44,807 --> 00:41:48,176
But you'll see, pretty soon,
I'll trust you, because you'll trust me.

512
00:41:48,352 --> 00:41:51,555
What's good for you is good for me.
And you for me. We're the same.

513
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:54,517
We're equal.
We're partners, see? 5-0-5-0.

514
00:41:54,733 --> 00:41:56,642
You gotta realize
your body's important.

515
00:41:56,819 --> 00:41:58,396
And it's important to me too.

516
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:01,732
I ain't letting you throw
no martinis down there, or no smoke.

517
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:04,238
No more than I let them down
Little Nell.

518
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,197
- Who's that?
- Oh, that's my horse.

519
00:42:10,541 --> 00:42:12,165
She may win Saturday.

520
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:14,126
Hold the thought.

521
00:42:14,295 --> 00:42:18,506
And another thing, no late hours.
And of course men are out.

522
00:42:18,674 --> 00:42:21,675
In any manner, shape or form.

523
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:23,594
You're in training.

524
00:42:23,804 --> 00:42:25,762
Go on, now. Eat your food.
Nice and slow.

525
00:42:25,932 --> 00:42:27,889
Kind of, you know, relaxed inside.

526
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:31,552
Don't forget to throw me over
your shoulder...

527
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:34,516
...and burp me after lunch.
- I will if you need it.

528
00:42:37,276 --> 00:42:38,605
I'm so glad...

529
00:42:38,778 --> 00:42:42,563
...you plan to look after me
as well as you do your horse.

530
00:42:43,117 --> 00:42:45,524
You wanna joke? Joke.

531
00:42:46,537 --> 00:42:47,865
But I'll tell you something.

532
00:42:48,038 --> 00:42:50,446
Someday you'll realize something,
and that is this:

533
00:42:50,624 --> 00:42:54,076
We all gotta work together, see?
We all gotta cooperate.

534
00:42:54,295 --> 00:42:56,252
Everybody's sitting around the place.

535
00:42:56,463 --> 00:42:58,705
Everybody's sitting around the world.

536
00:42:58,883 --> 00:43:02,049
And everybody's brain
has got something cooking inside, see?

537
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,758
Well, nobody's got
a better dream than me.

538
00:43:05,931 --> 00:43:08,387
- Believe me, I stand them off.
- What is it?

539
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:11,097
I can see myself with greats.

540
00:43:11,604 --> 00:43:16,230
I can wind up with the top man,
the top horse and the top woman.

541
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:59,442
<i>Advantage,
Mrs. Pemberton and Mr. Parker.</i>

542
00:44:23,052 --> 00:44:25,377
<i>Game to Mrs. Pemberton
and Mr. Parker.</i>

543
00:44:25,555 --> 00:44:28,591
<i>They lead five games to three
in the first set.</i>

544
00:44:50,205 --> 00:44:51,865
- That's enough. You'd better quit.
- Not yet.

545
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,041
Don't wanna get all tired out.
You got a long day.

546
00:44:55,251 --> 00:44:57,956
- Long and hard.
- Why hard?

547
00:44:58,171 --> 00:45:00,413
Oh, I don't know.

548
00:45:01,216 --> 00:45:04,252
This place and
all the different people turning up.

549
00:45:04,427 --> 00:45:08,128
- You know, ones I know.
- Well, why? I don't dig that.

550
00:45:08,306 --> 00:45:12,636
I should think you'd be great.
Your hometown. Did that flower...?

551
00:45:12,811 --> 00:45:15,563
Maybe I would, if it weren't for...

552
00:45:27,828 --> 00:45:30,402
Come on, now.
You'd better quit. You're puffing again.

553
00:45:30,581 --> 00:45:33,915
Barney say that more than 100
of my Pacific Tech girls are out there?

554
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:36,291
No, no. They got a friend for me?

555
00:45:36,462 --> 00:45:38,205
- Announcing.
- That's it. That's it.

556
00:45:38,381 --> 00:45:40,504
Now, will you please remember,
start slow.

557
00:45:40,675 --> 00:45:42,584
Don't show them
all your stuff at once.

558
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,805
Remember, you're the best.
Even if you don't think so, I do.

559
00:45:46,973 --> 00:45:49,214
- Just play your regular game, you know?
- Yeah.

560
00:45:49,392 --> 00:45:52,179
It's beautiful. Just like you.

561
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,932
You know what I'm going to do?
For luck?

562
00:45:57,109 --> 00:46:00,644
- No.
- Give you a great big kiss.

563
00:46:01,739 --> 00:46:04,490
If you don't start slow, by the 15th or
16th game...

564
00:46:04,825 --> 00:46:06,070
...you're gonna start to press.

565
00:46:06,243 --> 00:46:08,283
We gotta remember,
the money dates are coming up.

566
00:46:08,454 --> 00:46:10,696
The big money dates.

567
00:46:20,174 --> 00:46:21,798
Ladies and gentlemen...

568
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:25,336
...the next match will be between
Pat Pemberton of Oakland...

569
00:46:25,513 --> 00:46:27,968
...and Gussie Moran
of Santa Monica, California.

570
00:46:28,349 --> 00:46:30,223
- Where's he sitting?
- Who's sitting?

571
00:46:30,393 --> 00:46:32,136
- Collier.
- Over here. X4.

572
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:35,146
- Introducing Gorgeous Gussie.
- Are you sure?

573
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:36,345
Am I sure?

574
00:46:36,524 --> 00:46:39,441
- Paid for it myself. He's on the cuffola.
- Thanks.

575
00:46:39,610 --> 00:46:41,686
I'd have paid better
if he'd stayed home.

576
00:46:41,863 --> 00:46:47,652
And her opponent,
California's own Pat Pemberton.

577
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:00,541
Drop it.

578
00:47:01,925 --> 00:47:04,250
- Rough it is. I'll start over there.
- I'll serve.

579
00:47:04,427 --> 00:47:06,005
Wait, shake hands.

580
00:47:06,179 --> 00:47:08,752
- That's it. Thanks a lot.
- Where's the smile, Pat?

581
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:11,601
- That's fine. That's it, girls.
- Thank you.

582
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:40,744
This is the feature event
of the afternoon...

583
00:47:40,923 --> 00:47:43,414
...climaxing a cross-country tour.

584
00:47:43,593 --> 00:47:46,000
As of today, Mrs. Pemberton
and Miss Moran...

585
00:47:46,179 --> 00:47:48,966
...are tied with 22 matches apiece.

586
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,054
This match will be
the best two out of three sets.

587
00:47:55,563 --> 00:47:57,556
Linesmen ready.

588
00:47:57,732 --> 00:47:59,523
Players ready.

589
00:48:00,276 --> 00:48:01,818
Mrs. Pemberton will serve first.

590
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,654
Play.

591
00:48:21,381 --> 00:48:23,374
Fifteen, Mrs. Pemberton.

592
00:48:40,067 --> 00:48:41,976
Thirty-love.

593
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,387
Forty-love.

594
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:44,541
Game to Mrs. Pemberton.

595
00:49:44,716 --> 00:49:47,587
She leads one game to love
in the first set.

596
00:49:48,554 --> 00:49:51,923
Mrs. Pemberton won the first set,
six games to three.

597
00:49:52,141 --> 00:49:56,008
She now leads three games to two
in the second set.

598
00:50:22,797 --> 00:50:25,466
Fifteen, Mrs. Pemberton.

599
00:50:56,123 --> 00:50:59,622
Double fault. Fifteen-all.

600
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:23,723
Fifteen-30.

601
00:51:36,038 --> 00:51:39,704
- Double fault, 15-40.
- She plays pretty good at times.

602
00:51:39,876 --> 00:51:42,746
She just gets that way
every once in a while.

603
00:52:10,031 --> 00:52:12,522
Game, Miss Moran.

604
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:15,154
Where's my racket?

605
00:53:35,827 --> 00:53:39,161
- There she is.
- There she is, come on.

606
00:53:39,331 --> 00:53:41,205
That's a girl.

607
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,703
All right.

608
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:44,786
I just couldn't make anything behave.

609
00:53:44,962 --> 00:53:48,247
Oh, that happens.
You know, a little slump. A dip.

610
00:53:48,424 --> 00:53:50,797
- A couple of weeks' rest.
- No, I'm okay.

611
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:53,507
We're going over to Elkwood Acres
over in New Jersey.

612
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,388
- Wonderful place.
- No, I'm all right.

613
00:53:55,557 --> 00:53:59,389
You mean more to me than all them
bucks. I'm gonna take care of you good.

614
00:53:59,561 --> 00:54:02,930
Who's that? Tell them to go away.

615
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:06,060
- Oh, you poor darling.
- Oh, hello, Coll.

616
00:54:06,234 --> 00:54:08,690
I'm all right.
Wasn't that a mess, though?

617
00:54:08,862 --> 00:54:12,361
- Oh, this is Mr. Conovan. Mr. Weld.
- Hello.

618
00:54:12,532 --> 00:54:14,406
How do you do?
I'm taking you home, Pat.

619
00:54:14,576 --> 00:54:17,530
- Now, get your things together.
- No. No, I'm all right here.

620
00:54:17,704 --> 00:54:19,033
If you'll excuse us, please?

621
00:54:19,206 --> 00:54:20,783
If it's about going somewhere...

622
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,793
...I'd like to stick around.
I'd like to kind of be on it.

623
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:26,997
- I'm sorry. We can't oblige.
- Well, I have a contract, you know.

624
00:54:27,172 --> 00:54:30,007
- I'll send you a copy of it. It says plain.
- Look, friend.

625
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:32,845
You've been responsible
for wrecking this girl's health.

626
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:36,427
- I'm not gonna let her stay around.
- Let's not raise your voice, now.

627
00:54:36,598 --> 00:54:39,136
You don't intimidate me.
I've never even heard of you.

628
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,725
No, but I've heard of you.
Joe Jinx, that's you.

629
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:47,190
Except when you're around, we got
a very valuable piece of property here.

630
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,111
And, you know, I ain't
the only one concerned, you know.

631
00:54:50,279 --> 00:54:52,817
I own the biggest piece
of this kid, 51 percent.

632
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,451
But there are other guys, you know,
that are in too, that own small pieces.

633
00:54:57,620 --> 00:55:01,320
And with her potential, I don't think
they'd like to see it all pulled...

634
00:55:01,499 --> 00:55:03,159
...right out from under them.

635
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:07,332
Now, I am in no position
to mention their names by name...

636
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:09,213
...but I can tell you this:

637
00:55:09,382 --> 00:55:11,837
They are the kind of types
that have been known...

638
00:55:12,009 --> 00:55:14,500
...to act very hotheaded
in their day and age.

639
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:18,012
Look, Conovan, you may think
that you own 51 percent of her...

640
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:20,305
...but you'll find out
that I own all of her.

641
00:55:20,476 --> 00:55:22,552
No, you don't.
Get away from me, all of you.

642
00:55:22,728 --> 00:55:25,599
Nobody owns anything
of anybody except myself.

643
00:55:25,773 --> 00:55:27,814
Go away, both of you.

644
00:55:27,985 --> 00:55:29,609
Leave me alone.

645
00:55:29,778 --> 00:55:31,320
Leave me alone.

646
00:55:31,488 --> 00:55:33,315
- Just go away.
- Well, I'll...

647
00:55:33,490 --> 00:55:36,741
- I'll be back.
- Go away. Go away.

648
00:55:44,251 --> 00:55:47,038
Hey, what is this?
What's happened here?

649
00:55:47,213 --> 00:55:49,170
What's happened?

650
00:55:56,305 --> 00:56:01,097
Hey. Hey, hey, slow down.

651
00:56:03,271 --> 00:56:05,940
- How you holding?
- Okay.

652
00:56:06,107 --> 00:56:09,690
- Feet heavy?
- Mine's heavy, Mike.

653
00:56:09,861 --> 00:56:13,728
Well, yours are supposed to be heavy.
You're a heavyweight, ain't you?

654
00:56:14,615 --> 00:56:16,691
Yeah, that's right.

655
00:56:16,868 --> 00:56:20,533
Like I told you.
Don't feel like running, slow down.

656
00:56:20,705 --> 00:56:22,994
You're supposed to feel like it.

657
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,205
That shows you're in condition.

658
00:56:25,835 --> 00:56:28,456
People do like they feel,
they go on sometimes...

659
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,421
...practically forever, some of them.

660
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:34,967
Guess you'll go on practically forever
if you stay on that bike.

661
00:56:35,762 --> 00:56:38,300
You're the best
because you feel right.

662
00:56:38,515 --> 00:56:42,215
I tell you, last week I was worried.
I'd just like to mention.

663
00:56:42,519 --> 00:56:44,428
And it was my fault, too.
I'm sorry.

664
00:56:44,604 --> 00:56:48,103
- Nothing to do with you.
- Yeah, pushed you too hard, too fast.

665
00:56:48,274 --> 00:56:50,647
I know what it was.

666
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:53,441
- Can't you tell me?
- Too personal.

667
00:56:53,613 --> 00:56:55,736
Hey.

668
00:56:57,701 --> 00:56:59,278
Hey.

669
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:02,704
There should be nothing too personal
between the two of you and me.

670
00:57:02,874 --> 00:57:04,416
It was Collier.

671
00:57:04,584 --> 00:57:06,872
I never can do anything
when he's watching me.

672
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:09,084
It's always been that way.

673
00:57:09,255 --> 00:57:12,291
- Why?
- Love with him, I guess.

674
00:57:12,467 --> 00:57:15,717
- Oh, like me with lobster.
- What?

675
00:57:15,887 --> 00:57:17,381
Lobster.

676
00:57:17,555 --> 00:57:19,014
The one thing I'm nuts about.

677
00:57:19,182 --> 00:57:21,056
The one thing
that don't agree with me.

678
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:23,432
- Like you and him.
- Not exactly.

679
00:57:23,603 --> 00:57:24,931
Why?

680
00:57:25,104 --> 00:57:28,853
Well, you see,
this is a question of getting married.

681
00:57:29,025 --> 00:57:32,109
You've never been married
to a lobster.

682
00:57:33,613 --> 00:57:35,736
That's what you think.

683
00:57:41,329 --> 00:57:42,658
- Hey, knock it off!
- Lights.

684
00:57:42,831 --> 00:57:44,159
What do you think is this?

685
00:57:44,332 --> 00:57:46,704
- Hold it, will you?
- It's Mike. Hurry up.

686
00:57:51,298 --> 00:57:53,255
- What is this?
- Just finishing, Mike.

687
00:57:53,425 --> 00:57:55,417
- Do you know what time it is?
- In a minute.

688
00:57:55,594 --> 00:58:01,964
- Ten after 9.
- Oh, gee, now we'll never know.

689
00:58:02,142 --> 00:58:04,680
I want you in bed,
asleep in five minutes, you get it?

690
00:58:04,853 --> 00:58:06,929
No comic books.
Go right to sleep, get that?

691
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:08,516
Right to sleep, yeah, Mike.

692
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,264
- I'll give it to you for letting him.
- I lost my head.

693
00:58:11,443 --> 00:58:13,768
In your position,
you shouldn't get so engrossed.

694
00:58:13,946 --> 00:58:15,606
Let's go.

695
00:58:21,912 --> 00:58:24,284
I was thinking about all that stuff
on the road.

696
00:58:24,456 --> 00:58:25,785
- Me too.
- Yeah.

697
00:58:25,958 --> 00:58:29,493
Funny how things come out like that.
Yeah, sure is.

698
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:32,243
- Good night.
- Well, I'll go in with you.

699
00:58:32,423 --> 00:58:34,830
- Yeah? Why?
- Some things I wanna go over with you.

700
00:58:35,009 --> 00:58:36,836
Well, couldn't they wait?

701
00:58:37,012 --> 00:58:40,013
Well, maybe they could,
but I don't know if I could.

702
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:44,808
- The only thing is my manager.
- Your manager?

703
00:58:44,978 --> 00:58:48,477
He's a little strict, and to tell you
the truth, I'm a bit scared of him.

704
00:58:48,648 --> 00:58:50,143
You are?

705
00:58:50,317 --> 00:58:52,986
I don't drink.
That's on account of him.

706
00:58:53,153 --> 00:58:54,481
Or smoke. That's him too.

707
00:58:54,654 --> 00:58:57,691
- The thing he's strictest about is men.
- Men, huh?

708
00:58:57,866 --> 00:59:02,243
Yeah, you know, dates and late hours
and emotional involvements.

709
00:59:02,412 --> 00:59:03,871
- And...
- He's got a point there.

710
00:59:04,039 --> 00:59:07,373
In fact, he doesn't even want me
to have anything to do with my fella.

711
00:59:07,543 --> 00:59:08,918
- No.
- No.

712
00:59:09,086 --> 00:59:12,040
You make him sound
like an awful gumboil.

713
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:15,215
Oh, I don't know.
He's not so bad, really.

714
00:59:15,384 --> 00:59:18,136
I think I'm just an animal to him,
like Little Nell.

715
00:59:18,303 --> 00:59:19,762
- Is that what you think?
- Yeah.

716
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,599
You sound like a gumboil yourself.

717
00:59:23,392 --> 00:59:25,883
- Good night.
- Good night.

718
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:18,482
Come here, little girl.
Come here.

719
01:00:50,982 --> 01:00:53,520
If you only were, honey.

720
01:01:02,493 --> 01:01:04,403
Hey, Barn.

721
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:07,248
Hey, where'd you drop from?

722
01:01:07,415 --> 01:01:09,573
- Hello, Barn.
- Something happen?

723
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:11,992
- The bout off?
- No, on.

724
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,376
- So far.
- Then what?

725
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:17,714
I have to talk to him,
Mike, is all I know.

726
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:22,760
- So why couldn't you use the phone?
- Because people hang up.

727
01:01:22,931 --> 01:01:25,172
- Where is he?
- Inside.

728
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:26,809
With her.

729
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:29,550
You go to the head of the class.

730
01:01:32,857 --> 01:01:35,183
- What are they doing?
- He's examining her.

731
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,187
- Why?
- Why do you think?

732
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:39,022
He wants to see into her condition.

733
01:01:39,197 --> 01:01:41,984
Why don't he examine me?
Ain't I fighting Friday?

734
01:01:42,158 --> 01:01:44,068
Because you he's not worried about.

735
01:01:44,244 --> 01:01:47,161
- He's worried about her.
- He's worried about her condition.

736
01:01:47,330 --> 01:01:50,950
He'd like to see her make out
next week down at that pro match.

737
01:01:51,961 --> 01:01:53,835
Why don't he examine
into my condition?

738
01:01:54,005 --> 01:01:55,665
Ain't I fighting Friday?

739
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,668
Davie, talking to you sometime is like
taking a ride on a merry-go-round.

740
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:03,336
The last time I was
on a merry-go-round, I threw up.

741
01:02:03,514 --> 01:02:06,302
- That's good.
- I went on that up-and-down one.

742
01:02:06,476 --> 01:02:08,350
- That's what did it.
- Going up and down?

743
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:10,559
Everybody goes up and down.

744
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:14,065
Why don't he examine me?

745
01:02:14,234 --> 01:02:15,562
Quit bugging me, will you?

746
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:19,318
I mentioned about my stitch,
but he don't care.

747
01:02:19,489 --> 01:02:22,988
Because I've been knocked out
the last four times, he's lost faith in me.

748
01:02:23,159 --> 01:02:26,659
- Funny guy.
- I don't think it's his fault.

749
01:02:26,830 --> 01:02:29,118
I think it's her fault.

750
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:31,865
Boy, I'd like to take a poke at her.

751
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:35,459
What are you looking for,
five straight knockouts?

752
01:02:40,051 --> 01:02:41,795
Fifty hops.

753
01:02:42,888 --> 01:02:44,512
Better turn out you're okay.

754
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,888
Otherwise we skip
the whole tournament.

755
01:02:47,059 --> 01:02:49,894
- Feel fine.
- I'll let you know soon how you feel.

756
01:02:50,062 --> 01:02:53,810
- I'd feel even better if I didn't do this.
- Quiet.

757
01:03:00,197 --> 01:03:02,984
Forty-eight, 49, 50.

758
01:03:05,244 --> 01:03:06,786
- Still going?
- What?

759
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:10,157
I say, is it still going?

760
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,415
- All right, lay down.
- Gladly. On my back or what?

761
01:03:15,587 --> 01:03:17,212
On your what.

762
01:03:20,676 --> 01:03:22,799
If I hurt you, just yell out.

763
01:03:25,223 --> 01:03:28,723
- You got a knot in there.
- Can work it out.

764
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:33,897
Hello. Hello. Hello.

765
01:03:34,065 --> 01:03:35,560
Who?

766
01:03:35,942 --> 01:03:37,485
What?

767
01:03:37,652 --> 01:03:39,444
Long distance?

768
01:03:39,613 --> 01:03:43,231
Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's for you.

769
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:45,200
Yes?

770
01:03:45,535 --> 01:03:47,113
How are you, dear?

771
01:03:47,788 --> 01:03:49,412
Oh, fine.

772
01:03:49,581 --> 01:03:53,081
No, honestly, much better.
In fact, all.

773
01:03:55,671 --> 01:03:57,129
What?

774
01:03:58,757 --> 01:04:00,251
Yeah.

775
01:04:04,096 --> 01:04:06,254
Well, to tell you the truth, Coll...

776
01:04:06,432 --> 01:04:11,177
...I'd just as soon you didn't,
such a long trip and all...

777
01:04:11,812 --> 01:04:15,228
...and you know how I get when you...

778
01:04:15,399 --> 01:04:18,435
Nothing, really.
He wants to come to the tournament.

779
01:04:18,611 --> 01:04:21,232
Tell him not to, will you?
He won't listen to me.

780
01:04:21,405 --> 01:04:23,279
Don't come.

781
01:04:24,158 --> 01:04:26,151
What? No. No, wait.

782
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:29,826
You do understand, don't you, darling?

783
01:04:29,997 --> 01:04:33,082
Well, all right. No, no.
I'll write to you too.

784
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:35,790
L... What?

785
01:04:39,048 --> 01:04:40,875
Now we gotta build
that left arm up...

786
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,921
...otherwise your whole swing
goes cockeyed.

787
01:04:45,263 --> 01:04:46,805
Sit up.

788
01:04:49,475 --> 01:04:52,180
When you gonna get wise
to this Collier bash?

789
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:54,310
Know what happened
when I was rubbing?

790
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,232
You know what happened
to your muscles, huh?

791
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,900
You got as tense as cold spaghetti.
I could feel it.

792
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:03,609
- I'll get over it.
- Five'll get you 10 you don't.

793
01:05:03,782 --> 01:05:06,570
- Bet.
- Okay, I'll tell you what you do.

794
01:05:06,869 --> 01:05:10,285
Don't use the right at all, see?
Use the left until I tell differently.

795
01:05:10,456 --> 01:05:13,326
Don't use the right for nothing.
Not even to eat with, see?

796
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:16,537
Everything with the left.
All right, lay down.

797
01:05:19,340 --> 01:05:21,083
Come on, push.

798
01:05:21,675 --> 01:05:23,170
Push.

799
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,216
Push.

800
01:05:32,979 --> 01:05:35,185
- Now, to get back to this Collier thing.
- Yeah.

801
01:05:35,356 --> 01:05:38,108
- Yeah, I don't think so.
- In what way?

802
01:05:38,276 --> 01:05:40,814
- In no way.
- I mean, in what way not?

803
01:05:40,987 --> 01:05:44,190
- In no way not.
- How would you know?

804
01:05:44,365 --> 01:05:48,149
Oh, just by keeping my ears
and my eyes open and my so forth.

805
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:52,325
I've been around. This man-woman thing,
that's gotta be a fifty-fifty thing.

806
01:05:52,498 --> 01:05:53,827
My feeling.

807
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,286
He's 75.
You'll never be 5-0-5-0 with him.

808
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:01,454
Why do you get yourself hooked
with a guy who's got his horns on you?

809
01:06:02,884 --> 01:06:04,544
That's all.

810
01:06:07,972 --> 01:06:10,298
- Let me ask you, Barney.
- Ask.

811
01:06:10,475 --> 01:06:13,227
- Why don't he examine me? Ain't l...?
- What?

812
01:06:13,395 --> 01:06:16,230
What's this? What are you doing?
You should be weighing in.

813
01:06:16,398 --> 01:06:18,723
- Tomorrow.
- What are you hanging around here for?

814
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,150
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't wanna go in alone no more.

815
01:06:22,362 --> 01:06:23,690
Like lately.

816
01:06:23,863 --> 01:06:26,734
What do you want us to do?
All go with you? That'd be fine.

817
01:06:26,908 --> 01:06:28,984
The three of us could lick the guy,
but you're a big boy now.

818
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:33,289
- You gotta learn to go in alone.
- I mean in the corner. You used to.

819
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:36,209
- I'm busy.
- Yeah...

820
01:06:36,377 --> 01:06:39,331
- Busy.
- I gotta get ready to go south.

821
01:06:39,505 --> 01:06:42,257
What do you want me to do?
Tear myself into little pieces?

822
01:06:42,425 --> 01:06:43,884
Sure not.

823
01:06:44,052 --> 01:06:46,922
Trouble is, I haven't asked
the three big questions lately.

824
01:06:47,096 --> 01:06:50,845
- I don't wanna go in alone no more.
- Who made you, Hucko?

825
01:06:51,017 --> 01:06:53,686
What's the matter?
Can't you hear good? Who made you?

826
01:06:53,853 --> 01:06:56,724
- You, Mike.
- Who owns the biggest piece of you?

827
01:06:56,898 --> 01:06:59,436
- You, Mike.
- What'll happen if I drop you?

828
01:06:59,609 --> 01:07:02,017
- Go right down the drain.
- And?

829
01:07:02,195 --> 01:07:05,315
- And stay there.
- And don't ever forget it.

830
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:09,274
Go back and tell Gibby if he lets you
loose again, he'll go down the drain too.

831
01:07:09,452 --> 01:07:12,702
- He'll go? I got it.
- Yeah.

832
01:07:13,373 --> 01:07:15,829
Now, what is with Little Nell?

833
01:07:18,628 --> 01:07:20,206
Hey.

834
01:07:22,007 --> 01:07:24,046
I don't like you.

835
01:07:24,217 --> 01:07:26,257
- I wish you did.
- But I don't.

836
01:07:26,428 --> 01:07:27,756
Why not?

837
01:07:27,929 --> 01:07:31,133
You made everything different
from what it used to in the old days.

838
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:33,265
Last year.

839
01:07:33,435 --> 01:07:36,555
- How old are you, Hucko?
- A hundred ninety-seven and a half.

840
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:38,272
- What?
- Pounds.

841
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,100
No. How old?

842
01:07:40,275 --> 01:07:41,935
Twenty-four.

843
01:07:42,110 --> 01:07:44,233
Five. Three. Why?

844
01:07:44,404 --> 01:07:46,895
Anyhow, too old
for the three big questions.

845
01:07:47,074 --> 01:07:48,901
Hey, you want me to tell Mike on you?

846
01:07:49,076 --> 01:07:50,487
He didn't make you
and doesn't own you...

847
01:07:50,661 --> 01:07:52,534
...and you wouldn't go down
the drain if he dropped you.

848
01:07:52,704 --> 01:07:54,744
- And stay there.
- You wouldn't.

849
01:07:54,915 --> 01:07:57,240
Ought to belong to yourself.

850
01:07:58,043 --> 01:07:59,917
What do I want with myself?

851
01:08:00,087 --> 01:08:03,752
When you're in that ring, you shouldn't
worry about anyone, Mike or anyone.

852
01:08:03,924 --> 01:08:06,296
Yeah?
What about that guy I'm fighting?

853
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:08,011
Not even him.

854
01:08:08,178 --> 01:08:10,468
You see, it's never you
against the whole world.

855
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,262
Yeah, that's good.
I couldn't lick the whole world.

856
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:16,851
- I don't think.
- Just you against yourself.

857
01:08:17,022 --> 01:08:18,397
Yeah?

858
01:08:18,565 --> 01:08:21,317
Well, I could lick myself, all right.

859
01:08:21,485 --> 01:08:24,023
- I think.
- You could?

860
01:08:24,196 --> 01:08:25,773
I think.

861
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:28,818
That's all you have to do.
Lick yourself.

862
01:08:28,992 --> 01:08:30,901
Make yourself and own yourself.

863
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:33,569
Never mind Mike or anyone.

864
01:08:33,747 --> 01:08:36,831
Hey, don't he never ask you
the three big questions?

865
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,376
I wouldn't let him.

866
01:08:38,544 --> 01:08:41,165
See, I'm trying to lick myself too.

867
01:08:41,338 --> 01:08:43,627
Hey, the only thing...

868
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:46,753
Why don't he examine me?

869
01:09:01,066 --> 01:09:02,726
So then:

870
01:09:04,069 --> 01:09:06,477
And then the bell:
End of the sixth.

871
01:09:06,655 --> 01:09:08,897
So then I breathe,
in and out, in and out.

872
01:09:09,074 --> 01:09:12,657
Oh, button it up, will you, Hucko?
We've been through this 40 times.

873
01:09:12,828 --> 01:09:16,032
- It's the seventh coming up. The end.
- Go ahead.

874
01:09:16,207 --> 01:09:18,495
I rush him. He's on his bike.

875
01:09:19,543 --> 01:09:22,213
He starts coming in.
That's when it happened, the thing.

876
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:25,297
The big thing.
He's coming and I look.

877
01:09:25,466 --> 01:09:28,917
And who you think it is?
It's me. It's me coming at me.

878
01:09:29,095 --> 01:09:31,171
So I get mad.

879
01:09:34,142 --> 01:09:37,012
I'm hollering down his ear,
"Okay, Hucko."

880
01:09:37,186 --> 01:09:39,226
"Get this, Hucko."
Kidney punch.

881
01:09:39,397 --> 01:09:41,473
"You're through, Hucko."

882
01:09:43,484 --> 01:09:46,771
Now I go in. Before I throw it, even,
I knew already it was the one.

883
01:09:48,282 --> 01:09:50,773
And I seen him drop.

884
01:09:53,078 --> 01:09:56,946
And then after, when Gibby jumps in
and grabs me and gives me a kiss...

885
01:09:57,124 --> 01:10:00,576
...I says to him,
"You see me, how I flattened myself?"

886
01:10:01,170 --> 01:10:04,586
So he starts in putting cold towels
on my head.

887
01:10:05,091 --> 01:10:06,585
Okay. Take a walk.

888
01:10:06,759 --> 01:10:08,383
Okay, Mike.

889
01:10:08,552 --> 01:10:10,675
- Hey, can I lift her up?
- No.

890
01:10:10,846 --> 01:10:12,673
Just once?

891
01:10:12,848 --> 01:10:16,300
- All right, then blow.
- Yeah.

892
01:10:22,233 --> 01:10:24,356
Thanks, Mike.

893
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:29,987
Could be he had his brains
knocked loose.

894
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:31,901
Oh, he's fine.

895
01:10:32,076 --> 01:10:34,069
What's all this
fighting-yourself malarkey?

896
01:10:34,245 --> 01:10:36,570
How does a guy like that
pick up stuff like that?

897
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:38,076
I wonder.

898
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:39,874
Hey...

899
01:10:40,793 --> 01:10:43,284
- Me?
- What's doing here?

900
01:10:43,463 --> 01:10:45,705
You been talking at him?

901
01:10:46,466 --> 01:10:48,293
- Do you mind?
- No. No.

902
01:10:48,468 --> 01:10:52,051
I was gonna suggest maybe
you have a talk with Little Nell.

903
01:10:53,306 --> 01:10:55,464
- Mike?
- Now, we gotta go over schedules...

904
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,101
- Yes, Mike.
- Yeah.

905
01:10:57,268 --> 01:11:00,934
This thing about getting the same room
as the last time I was down here.

906
01:11:01,106 --> 01:11:03,478
Is that just a coincidence,
or did you arrange it?

907
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,643
Just a coincidence.

908
01:11:05,944 --> 01:11:07,771
Tell me the truth.

909
01:11:08,196 --> 01:11:09,571
I arranged it.

910
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:12,028
- I thought so.
- Why?

911
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,525
- Because I'm getting to know you.
- About time.

912
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,454
And it turns out you're
just a big sentimental slob.

913
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:19,580
Yeah, that's me.

914
01:11:19,833 --> 01:11:21,625
My, my, my.

915
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:23,372
My, my, my, what?

916
01:11:23,546 --> 01:11:26,962
Oh, excuse me. I forgot to knock.

917
01:11:27,967 --> 01:11:29,627
Come in.

918
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,928
- Guess who's here.
- Them.

919
01:11:33,097 --> 01:11:36,348
- How'd you know?
- Tell them to swing it in.

920
01:11:40,522 --> 01:11:41,850
- The boys.
- What boys?

921
01:11:42,023 --> 01:11:44,182
- The partners.
- I thought they were anonymous.

922
01:11:44,359 --> 01:11:47,146
Well, maybe they decided
to be non-anonymous.

923
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:49,313
After all, these gentlemen
are no hoodlums.

924
01:11:49,489 --> 01:11:51,814
They're businessmen.
Plain, ordinary businessmen.

925
01:11:51,992 --> 01:11:54,529
- Investors.
- All the same.

926
01:11:54,703 --> 01:11:56,695
You can't have it perfect.

927
01:11:58,164 --> 01:11:59,872
Okay.

928
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:02,162
- Hello, Spec.
- Hello, Mike.

929
01:12:02,335 --> 01:12:05,253
- Glad to see you. Hank, how are you?
- Could be worse.

930
01:12:05,422 --> 01:12:08,043
- Thought we'd like to see you, man.
- Well, you know me.

931
01:12:08,216 --> 01:12:10,292
Never too busy to say hello.

932
01:12:10,469 --> 01:12:13,339
- There she is.
- How do you do, gentlemen?

933
01:12:13,513 --> 01:12:15,589
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.

934
01:12:15,766 --> 01:12:17,308
Likewise.

935
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:19,599
Wouldn't you like to sit down?

936
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,142
Yeah, sit down. Sit down.
You can all find chairs.

937
01:12:22,314 --> 01:12:24,353
Why don't you sit over there.

938
01:12:25,317 --> 01:12:28,188
Oh, thanks, Barney.
Thank you, boy.

939
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:32,398
Let's everybody have a drink,
on me

940
01:12:32,574 --> 01:12:35,492
I never allow no alcoholic beverages
around the lady here.

941
01:12:35,661 --> 01:12:36,989
Who said alcoholic?

942
01:12:37,162 --> 01:12:39,832
I mean, you know, like beer
or something like that.

943
01:12:39,998 --> 01:12:42,916
- Even beer.
- Milk?

944
01:12:43,085 --> 01:12:46,584
- Milk's okay.
- How's about everybody a glass of milk?

945
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:49,370
All right, some milk. Fill them up.

946
01:12:51,969 --> 01:12:55,670
There seems to be quite a lot of dough...
You know, money.

947
01:12:55,849 --> 01:12:58,091
- Around that says you can make it.

948
01:12:58,268 --> 01:13:01,186
- You know, win it.
- Well, money talks.

949
01:13:02,397 --> 01:13:04,354
Here, here.

950
01:13:04,983 --> 01:13:07,023
Have one yourself, Barney.

951
01:13:07,194 --> 01:13:09,317
Golf is what I call a nice game.

952
01:13:09,488 --> 01:13:11,231
Very nice.

953
01:13:13,075 --> 01:13:14,866
I mean, it's dignified.

954
01:13:15,035 --> 01:13:17,360
And fresh air.
Men and women both.

955
01:13:17,746 --> 01:13:21,958
Now, you take those lady wrestlers.
That's something I can't stomach.

956
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,083
Stand. Lady wrestlers.

957
01:13:24,253 --> 01:13:27,372
That's something that shouldn't
ought to be allowed, but golf...

958
01:13:27,548 --> 01:13:29,208
...that's different.

959
01:13:29,383 --> 01:13:33,001
- Yeah. Well, we don't wrestle.
- Not yet.

960
01:13:34,555 --> 01:13:37,425
Mike, tell Barney to go out,
do you mind?

961
01:13:38,017 --> 01:13:41,966
- Go out.
- Nothing personal, Barney. Business.

962
01:13:44,148 --> 01:13:45,690
Business?

963
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:48,692
Wait a minute.

964
01:13:55,076 --> 01:13:58,527
The thing is, Mike, we wanna know
how you figure this thing to come out.

965
01:13:58,704 --> 01:14:00,613
No idea.

966
01:14:01,248 --> 01:14:02,659
You mean, not yet.

967
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:06,368
I mean that after it's over,
I'll let you know how it come out.

968
01:14:06,545 --> 01:14:08,123
Wait a second.

969
01:14:08,297 --> 01:14:10,705
- Maybe she ought to go out too.
- No thank you.

970
01:14:10,883 --> 01:14:13,635
Mike, look, we don't care
what way it comes out.

971
01:14:13,803 --> 01:14:15,760
Only thing, we'd like to know ahead.

972
01:14:15,930 --> 01:14:17,923
You want my opinion?
I think she'll win it.

973
01:14:18,099 --> 01:14:19,807
- For sure she's...?
- No, not sure.

974
01:14:19,976 --> 01:14:22,846
Makes a sick bet.
The win, you can't be sure.

975
01:14:23,020 --> 01:14:26,140
The lose, that's insurance.

976
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:28,142
No, no. No, don't say anything.

977
01:14:28,359 --> 01:14:30,352
Wait a minute.
Don't say anything.

978
01:14:30,528 --> 01:14:32,735
Oh, boys, it's no-go. No-go.

979
01:14:32,907 --> 01:14:35,742
Now, you remember I told you
when you come in on this kid?

980
01:14:35,910 --> 01:14:38,401
I promised nothing
but a great lady athlete.

981
01:14:38,579 --> 01:14:40,572
No tricks, no deals, no nothing.

982
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:43,702
You think it's fair to us
to all of a sudden go legitimate?

983
01:14:43,918 --> 01:14:46,788
- How'd you get in such a jam?
- Look at the books, will you?

984
01:14:46,962 --> 01:14:49,880
I never knew there was
so much money to be made honest.

985
01:14:51,717 --> 01:14:54,884
I don't think it's right,
you being unfriendly.

986
01:14:59,976 --> 01:15:04,223
I don't think it's right neither.
In fact, it's wrong.

987
01:15:07,108 --> 01:15:10,524
Excuse me for not finishing my milk.

988
01:15:10,695 --> 01:15:13,945
Only thing is, it gives me the gas.

989
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:25,664
I'll do whatever you say
about it, Mike.

990
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:27,709
- Whatever's best for you.
- What's the matter with you?

991
01:15:27,879 --> 01:15:30,251
- Don't talk like that. Listen here.
- I don't care.

992
01:15:30,423 --> 01:15:32,961
I caught something from you.
And it's good. I like it.

993
01:15:33,134 --> 01:15:36,503
But don't you catch nothing from me,
I ain't got nothing good to catch.

994
01:15:36,679 --> 01:15:38,802
If there's trouble,
I want my share of it.

995
01:15:38,973 --> 01:15:41,809
Yeah, it looks like there's going to be
plenty to go around.

996
01:15:41,976 --> 01:15:44,468
No, I mean the way
you said things ought to be.

997
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:47,315
- How?
- 5-0-5-0.

998
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,234
- Lay down.
- Now?

999
01:15:52,404 --> 01:15:57,149
Yeah. Yeah, I'll let you get a little nap
and then have dinner.

1000
01:15:58,410 --> 01:16:02,906
Take a little walk.
Then turn in nice and early.

1001
01:16:03,081 --> 01:16:04,873
And don't worry about nothing.

1002
01:16:05,041 --> 01:16:07,201
Don't worry about a thing.

1003
01:16:09,714 --> 01:16:11,790
You're a great girl.

1004
01:16:12,008 --> 01:16:13,668
You're the best.

1005
01:16:13,843 --> 01:16:15,385
Thanks.

1006
01:16:27,690 --> 01:16:30,312
And I'm gonna tell you
another thing, furthermore.

1007
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,193
After you cop this in the morning...

1008
01:16:32,362 --> 01:16:34,983
...I'm gonna start lining up
some shots in Europe.

1009
01:16:35,156 --> 01:16:37,944
Boy, will they go for you,
all them Europeans.

1010
01:16:38,118 --> 01:16:40,406
- I haven't copped it yet.
- Sure you have.

1011
01:16:40,578 --> 01:16:42,121
In my head you have.

1012
01:16:42,289 --> 01:16:44,958
The way I figure,
you've got the thing done.

1013
01:16:45,125 --> 01:16:47,877
- The thing you're gonna do.
- That's nice.

1014
01:16:48,336 --> 01:16:51,041
I can feel it in your bones.

1015
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:56,294
Sure pretty dress
you got covering you.

1016
01:16:57,054 --> 01:16:58,797
Thank you.

1017
01:16:59,306 --> 01:17:02,805
You certainly are carrying
the right silks tonight, kid.

1018
01:17:03,352 --> 01:17:06,187
It does more for you than
them pants you're always wearing.

1019
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:09,521
Easier to play in,
is why I wear the pants.

1020
01:17:09,691 --> 01:17:13,143
I think sometimes you ought to
change around. Give the public a break.

1021
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:16,191
I'm not sure
that I'd be able to play in...

1022
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:19,986
- What is this?
- Sorry to barge in.

1023
01:17:20,160 --> 01:17:21,489
Well, barge out.

1024
01:17:21,662 --> 01:17:24,069
Wait a second, Mike.
Something you don't know.

1025
01:17:24,248 --> 01:17:26,917
- Sam's out.
- In fact, it was us bought him.

1026
01:17:27,084 --> 01:17:30,001
I never seen him so upset since lately.

1027
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:32,708
See, Sam suffers
from the high blood pressure.

1028
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,376
He can't stand the gaff.

1029
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:38,133
He can handle any situation
so long it's a situation...

1030
01:17:38,304 --> 01:17:40,343
...without aggravation. Otherwise, no.

1031
01:17:40,514 --> 01:17:43,469
And the minute he realized
you were not going to play ball...

1032
01:17:43,643 --> 01:17:45,932
...it was a situation with aggravation.

1033
01:17:46,104 --> 01:17:49,639
Okay. Thanks for the flash.
Now, get out of here, will you?

1034
01:17:49,816 --> 01:17:52,936
Can't you see we're talking
important business? Strategy.

1035
01:17:53,111 --> 01:17:56,361
That's just what we want
to talk to you about, Mike. Strategy.

1036
01:17:56,531 --> 01:17:57,907
We've been considering...

1037
01:17:58,075 --> 01:18:00,613
...and we think you're very foolish,
the both of you.

1038
01:18:00,786 --> 01:18:02,197
You don't see it our way.

1039
01:18:02,371 --> 01:18:05,241
It's a very full hatful
we can grab off here.

1040
01:18:05,415 --> 01:18:07,788
- Blow.
- You shouldn't talk like that, Mike.

1041
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:09,418
- Not to us.
- Please...

1042
01:18:09,586 --> 01:18:11,662
What's the matter?
What're you trying to do?

1043
01:18:11,839 --> 01:18:14,958
Destroy your own property?
What's wrong with you two pinheads?

1044
01:18:15,134 --> 01:18:17,625
Look, can't you see
you're getting her all tensed up?

1045
01:18:17,803 --> 01:18:19,594
You're absolutely right, Mike.

1046
01:18:19,763 --> 01:18:23,713
I think the best would be for us
to step outside and talk over.

1047
01:18:23,892 --> 01:18:25,969
That would be good.

1048
01:18:26,896 --> 01:18:28,354
Why outside?

1049
01:18:28,522 --> 01:18:32,650
- Well, you know, quiet.
- We wouldn't get the lady all upset.

1050
01:18:33,861 --> 01:18:35,984
All right, let's go.

1051
01:18:36,155 --> 01:18:38,527
- You stay here. I'll be right back.
- You will?

1052
01:18:38,699 --> 01:18:42,033
Well, I hope so.
I ain't finished my baked potato.

1053
01:18:55,383 --> 01:18:57,043
Come on, what about it? Let's talk.

1054
01:18:57,218 --> 01:19:00,302
- You wanna go to your hometowns?
- We'll talk down over here.

1055
01:19:00,471 --> 01:19:02,013
- Mike.
- You stay out of this.

1056
01:19:02,223 --> 01:19:04,631
- I wanna go with you.
- You think I can't take care of myself?

1057
01:19:04,809 --> 01:19:07,300
- No, I don't.
- I can take care of myself...

1058
01:19:07,478 --> 01:19:10,728
...you and them.
Now, stay out of this. Go on.

1059
01:19:11,357 --> 01:19:13,480
All right, let's go.

1060
01:19:16,279 --> 01:19:18,189
Come on, let's get on with it.

1061
01:19:18,365 --> 01:19:20,488
We'll get on.
We want to know what you'll do.

1062
01:19:20,659 --> 01:19:24,028
I told you already. I ain't gonna
make no deals with you, see?

1063
01:19:24,872 --> 01:19:27,410
- Two against one, huh?
- That's right. Two against one.

1064
01:19:27,583 --> 01:19:30,121
And that's how it is
in this business too, wise guy.

1065
01:19:30,294 --> 01:19:33,995
- Two against one.
- You want your usual percent...?

1066
01:19:38,302 --> 01:19:40,840
Hey, my glasses.
What's the big idea?

1067
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:45,343
Hey, that's no fair, I'm telling you.
Hey, where are my glasses?

1068
01:19:46,227 --> 01:19:47,887
- What is it, anyway?
- It's no fair.

1069
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:50,636
Did you ever see
a thing like this before?

1070
01:19:55,570 --> 01:19:58,239
Ever see a thing like this before?
What is it?

1071
01:19:58,406 --> 01:20:00,066
My glasses.

1072
01:20:00,241 --> 01:20:01,783
It's no fair, I'm telling you.

1073
01:20:01,951 --> 01:20:03,280
My glasses.

1074
01:20:06,623 --> 01:20:09,244
Which one of you belongs to this?

1075
01:20:11,461 --> 01:20:13,833
- Where'd you get it, Kronski?
- From the lady.

1076
01:20:14,005 --> 01:20:16,710
- Where did you get it?
- Out of his hand.

1077
01:20:16,925 --> 01:20:18,798
- Where'd you get it?
- In the head.

1078
01:20:18,968 --> 01:20:21,459
- I wanna make a complaint.
- We'll get to that.

1079
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:24,722
Now, which one of you
wants to report bodily injury?

1080
01:20:25,016 --> 01:20:27,934
- Nothing.
- Me. Look at that.

1081
01:20:28,103 --> 01:20:30,724
And see that?
And where do you think I got that?

1082
01:20:30,897 --> 01:20:34,562
- Okay.
- Internal injuries.

1083
01:20:35,402 --> 01:20:37,727
All right. What happened?

1084
01:20:37,904 --> 01:20:41,320
- Anybody.
- This women blew her top, that's all.

1085
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:43,650
- Did you see the whole thing?
- I sure did. L...

1086
01:20:43,827 --> 01:20:46,152
- Could I say a word? Just one word.
- You bet.

1087
01:20:46,329 --> 01:20:50,078
I don't think anybody wants a big thing
out of this. We all know each other.

1088
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:52,788
These two gentlemen and I,
we're in business together.

1089
01:20:52,962 --> 01:20:55,038
- What kind of business?
- Well...

1090
01:20:55,214 --> 01:20:57,456
You see, the three of us,
we own her.

1091
01:20:59,761 --> 01:21:02,003
- The three of you?
- Yeah, sure.

1092
01:21:02,472 --> 01:21:05,389
She's our lady athlete.
Very well-known, captain.

1093
01:21:05,558 --> 01:21:07,884
We got her entered in a tournament
here tomorrow.

1094
01:21:08,061 --> 01:21:10,599
- I know.
- Yeah, we had this little disagreement.

1095
01:21:10,772 --> 01:21:13,892
You know, a kind of
a misunderstanding.

1096
01:21:14,192 --> 01:21:16,600
Why don't you just forget
about the whole thing.

1097
01:21:16,778 --> 01:21:18,237
Well, what about this thing?

1098
01:21:18,405 --> 01:21:21,240
- Want me to forget this thing too?
- No, sir, I...

1099
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,614
- Just show me what happened.
- What's the point?

1100
01:21:23,785 --> 01:21:25,576
I'd like to see what happened.

1101
01:21:25,787 --> 01:21:28,492
Well, we were standing over
by the car, the three of us.

1102
01:21:28,665 --> 01:21:31,238
- Just talking.
- And where were you?

1103
01:21:31,418 --> 01:21:33,292
I was in the middle,
where I usually am.

1104
01:21:33,461 --> 01:21:35,288
- And you?
- I was up on the porch.

1105
01:21:35,464 --> 01:21:37,337
You're in the middle,
get in the middle.

1106
01:21:37,507 --> 01:21:40,177
You on the porch, stay there.
You three were arguing.

1107
01:21:40,343 --> 01:21:43,380
We were arguing.
They came up behind me there.

1108
01:21:43,555 --> 01:21:44,966
In self-defense.

1109
01:21:45,140 --> 01:21:48,591
This guy with the glasses on started
like he was gonna throw a punch.

1110
01:21:48,769 --> 01:21:51,805
- I got kind of excited.
- That was when I ran down.

1111
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:53,973
Yeah, like Count Fleet
she ran down there.

1112
01:21:54,149 --> 01:21:56,474
- What happened to your punch?
- I never threw no...

1113
01:21:56,652 --> 01:21:59,902
- No, he didn't get the chance to.
- What happened when you got there?

1114
01:22:00,072 --> 01:22:02,645
Well, the first thing,
I disengaged this fellow.

1115
01:22:02,825 --> 01:22:04,283
How?

1116
01:22:04,451 --> 01:22:07,121
Well, like:

1117
01:22:10,958 --> 01:22:13,579
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.
- Let go of me. Let go of me.

1118
01:22:13,752 --> 01:22:16,243
What am I around here?
I'm gonna kill somebody here.

1119
01:22:16,422 --> 01:22:18,747
Am I a sack of potatoes
around here or something?

1120
01:22:18,924 --> 01:22:21,083
And what were you doing
all this time?

1121
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,217
- Just what I'm doing now.
- Nothing?

1122
01:22:23,387 --> 01:22:25,878
- What else was there to do?
- Then what?

1123
01:22:26,056 --> 01:22:28,762
Then...
Well, I am very sorry about this.

1124
01:22:28,935 --> 01:22:31,426
I should like to apologize
to this man for doing it.

1125
01:22:31,605 --> 01:22:33,847
- Doing what?
- For throwing away his eyeglasses.

1126
01:22:34,024 --> 01:22:35,352
She sure did.

1127
01:22:35,525 --> 01:22:37,399
I couldn't think of
anything else to do.

1128
01:22:37,569 --> 01:22:39,360
Then he went down
to hunt for them...

1129
01:22:39,529 --> 01:22:43,112
...and I turned, sort of
to lead Mr. Conovan away.

1130
01:22:43,283 --> 01:22:45,572
To lead me? I thought
you were gonna carry me

1131
01:22:45,744 --> 01:22:49,742
- Go ahead.
- Then the little one came toward Mike.

1132
01:22:49,915 --> 01:22:53,533
- No. No, I come toward you.
- Anyway, Mike started toward him.

1133
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,869
Yeah, I started,
I came at you, remember?

1134
01:22:56,046 --> 01:23:00,091
- But I pushed him out of the way.
- What did you do that for?

1135
01:23:00,426 --> 01:23:02,502
Well, I didn't want him to get hurt.

1136
01:23:02,678 --> 01:23:05,632
No, she didn't want me to get hurt.

1137
01:23:06,223 --> 01:23:09,557
Then I think I took
this little one by the wrist.

1138
01:23:09,727 --> 01:23:11,933
Go away from me.

1139
01:23:12,104 --> 01:23:15,687
Yeah, she grabbed him by the wrist
and he went halfway down like this.

1140
01:23:15,858 --> 01:23:18,527
So she took the jack out of his hand
and looked at it...

1141
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:23,071
...and conked him right on the head,
then he fell rest of the way like this:

1142
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:26,859
And what were you doing
all this time?

1143
01:23:27,328 --> 01:23:29,237
Just watching.

1144
01:23:30,122 --> 01:23:31,996
I hope you fellas
have been on the ball.

1145
01:23:32,166 --> 01:23:34,574
- You could learn something.
- She's okay.

1146
01:23:34,752 --> 01:23:37,955
- Where'd you pick that up?
- I've been around physical ed for years.

1147
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:40,538
- Physical Ed? Who's he?
- Education.

1148
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:43,338
Okay, come here, all of you.

1149
01:23:43,761 --> 01:23:46,715
Henry Tasling, that you?

1150
01:23:46,889 --> 01:23:50,341
- That's right.
- Also known as Harry Creavy?

1151
01:23:50,518 --> 01:23:54,563
- That's been a long time since.
- Also as Ray Bryler?

1152
01:23:54,731 --> 01:23:56,770
Only once. I was little and they used...

1153
01:23:56,941 --> 01:23:59,183
Under these names,
have you been apprehended...

1154
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:04,070
...seven times in this state on charges
of illegal betting, bookmaking, assault?

1155
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:06,649
Something like that, yeah.

1156
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:10,118
Are you aware
that a court order signed...

1157
01:24:10,289 --> 01:24:13,456
...by Judge Evan McEnroe
August 12, 1949, prohibits you...

1158
01:24:13,626 --> 01:24:17,077
...from carrying on any business
of any nature whatsoever in this state?

1159
01:24:17,254 --> 01:24:20,042
- I wasn't doing no business.
- He says you were.

1160
01:24:20,216 --> 01:24:23,133
- What business?
- Silvester Cauley, that you?

1161
01:24:23,302 --> 01:24:24,631
- Yeah.
- Also known as...

1162
01:24:24,804 --> 01:24:29,264
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Yeah, you got it down there all okay.

1163
01:24:29,517 --> 01:24:31,972
- Anything on him?
- Nothing.

1164
01:24:32,186 --> 01:24:35,851
All right, I wanna hold these two men
pending a report to Judge McEnroe...

1165
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:39,392
...as to a violation of his order.
That's all. See you in the morning.

1166
01:24:39,569 --> 01:24:41,857
- Handle that, Kronski.
- Thanks.

1167
01:24:42,030 --> 01:24:44,402
Okay, we're adjourned.

1168
01:24:46,951 --> 01:24:48,743
How does it look
for tomorrow, anyway?

1169
01:24:48,911 --> 01:24:50,322
- Who knows?
- Well, good luck.

1170
01:24:50,496 --> 01:24:54,625
- I've got a few savings riding on you.
- Oh, thank you, goodbye.

1171
01:24:56,127 --> 01:24:57,835
Mike.

1172
01:24:58,004 --> 01:24:59,546
Mike!

1173
01:24:59,714 --> 01:25:02,750
- Mike, listen.
- I've been listening all night.

1174
01:25:02,926 --> 01:25:05,464
Then do you want to talk? I'll listen.

1175
01:25:06,012 --> 01:25:07,043
Leave me alone, will you?

1176
01:25:07,222 --> 01:25:10,555
I can understand your being upset,
but why with me? What have I done?

1177
01:25:10,725 --> 01:25:13,560
- Too much, that's what.
- But...

1178
01:25:14,688 --> 01:25:17,807
- Mike, don't be like this.
- Like what?

1179
01:25:17,983 --> 01:25:19,560
Lmpossible.

1180
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:22,652
Oh, so that's what I am.
Impossible.

1181
01:25:23,029 --> 01:25:25,567
- Right now, yes.
- I don't happen to agree with you.

1182
01:25:25,740 --> 01:25:27,899
I think I'm possible.
I also think I'm stupid.

1183
01:25:28,076 --> 01:25:30,152
- Why?
- For the way I handle you, that's why.

1184
01:25:30,328 --> 01:25:33,614
I've built you up into some kind
of a Frankenstein monster.

1185
01:25:33,790 --> 01:25:37,455
That's what you are, you're just
a great big Mrs. Frankenstein.

1186
01:25:37,627 --> 01:25:41,496
You don't think this will get around?
You don't think everybody will know it?

1187
01:25:41,674 --> 01:25:45,126
I won't even be able
to show my face in Lindy's.

1188
01:25:45,303 --> 01:25:47,379
I don't like the combination.
I thought I would, but I don't.

1189
01:25:47,555 --> 01:25:49,097
I like everything to be 5-0-5-0.

1190
01:25:49,265 --> 01:25:52,136
I like a he to be a he
and a she to be a she.

1191
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:53,970
But you said...

1192
01:25:58,233 --> 01:26:00,225
- Hold it.
- What?

1193
01:26:01,069 --> 01:26:02,397
- Go in the back way.
- Why?

1194
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:05,655
- Quiet down.
- Why? Why?

1195
01:26:11,162 --> 01:26:13,736
- Oh, Pat!
- I think somebody's yelling "Pat."

1196
01:26:13,915 --> 01:26:15,575
No, cat. They're calling their cat.

1197
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:17,743
- Pat, what's the matter?
- Hello, Collier.

1198
01:26:17,919 --> 01:26:19,995
Now, you come back
any time after the match.

1199
01:26:20,172 --> 01:26:21,880
- You're a little early now.
- Listen...

1200
01:26:22,048 --> 01:26:24,374
- Don't touch her right arm.
- Well, how about you?

1201
01:26:24,551 --> 01:26:27,505
- I got the other arm. Now, go away.
- Listen here, old man.

1202
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:29,968
- Old man?
- I've got as much right as you have.

1203
01:26:30,140 --> 01:26:31,468
Come back in the morning...

1204
01:26:31,642 --> 01:26:34,761
Stop handling me, everybody, please!

1205
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:39,138
You got a tough deal, all right,
there, buster. I feel for you.

1206
01:26:39,525 --> 01:26:41,398
Oh, you do?

1207
01:26:42,277 --> 01:26:44,768
That chick is sure stuck on you.

1208
01:26:44,947 --> 01:26:48,731
I can't quite understand why,
but there it is.

1209
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:52,074
She's so stuck on you
that you jinx her.

1210
01:26:52,246 --> 01:26:55,366
You're in this business.
Have you ever heard of anything like it?

1211
01:26:55,541 --> 01:26:58,992
Oh, only two or three million times,
that's all.

1212
01:26:59,169 --> 01:27:02,005
You see, athletes,
they ain't like us, you know.

1213
01:27:02,172 --> 01:27:05,126
They're like what you call freaks.

1214
01:27:05,342 --> 01:27:07,631
Nobody can understand
how they do what they do.

1215
01:27:07,803 --> 01:27:11,848
They can't understand it themselves.
And different things throw them.

1216
01:27:12,016 --> 01:27:14,590
So who knows what,
why, where, when, see?

1217
01:27:14,770 --> 01:27:16,145
Yeah.

1218
01:27:16,605 --> 01:27:19,356
It's just like...
Now, you take little Joe Palone.

1219
01:27:19,524 --> 01:27:20,935
- Who?
- The jockey.

1220
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:22,438
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

1221
01:27:22,611 --> 01:27:25,778
For a long time my horse, Little Nell,
couldn't win nothing.

1222
01:27:25,948 --> 01:27:29,648
She couldn't win?
Say, she had trouble coming in last.

1223
01:27:29,826 --> 01:27:32,946
And I couldn't figure it.
And then I figured it.

1224
01:27:33,121 --> 01:27:35,695
She couldn't win
because Joe Palone was riding her.

1225
01:27:35,874 --> 01:27:38,579
I got rid. She won great.

1226
01:27:39,169 --> 01:27:41,791
It's the same in this case, buster.

1227
01:27:42,548 --> 01:27:45,418
You are the wrong jockey
for this chick.

1228
01:27:45,592 --> 01:27:48,878
- You don't say.
- Yeah, I do say.

1229
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:51,676
So how about giving us all
a nice big break...

1230
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:53,723
...and making yourself
scarce tomorrow?

1231
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:55,684
- Why?
- Because, don't you understand?

1232
01:27:55,853 --> 01:27:58,095
When you're around,
she's no good. She's dead.

1233
01:27:58,272 --> 01:28:01,771
What you do after her working hours,
I don't care, go as far as you like.

1234
01:28:01,942 --> 01:28:04,101
But when she's on, you stay off.

1235
01:28:04,278 --> 01:28:05,606
- Can we deal?
- No.

1236
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,401
- Why not?
- Your business doesn't interest me.

1237
01:28:08,574 --> 01:28:10,199
Tell me something, will you?

1238
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,322
Were you born stubborn,
or did you learn this in college?

1239
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:18,158
See you in the morning, Conovan.
On the first tee.

1240
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:56,641
What?

1241
01:29:57,310 --> 01:29:59,766
Don't use your right arm.

1242
01:29:59,938 --> 01:30:02,559
- What is it?
- Go on. Be quiet. Go back to sleep.

1243
01:30:02,732 --> 01:30:04,690
How long have you been here?

1244
01:30:04,860 --> 01:30:06,852
I just came in
to check up, that's all.

1245
01:30:07,028 --> 01:30:09,270
The windows. I do it every night.

1246
01:30:09,447 --> 01:30:13,908
- You do what every night?
- Check the windows, fix the covers.

1247
01:30:14,578 --> 01:30:16,369
Sure.

1248
01:30:16,621 --> 01:30:18,947
Sometimes you kick them off.

1249
01:30:38,645 --> 01:30:40,887
What's the matter? You can't sleep?

1250
01:30:52,242 --> 01:30:54,567
Don't say anything.
Nothing, just shut up.

1251
01:30:54,744 --> 01:30:56,867
Why I didn't get on this
sooner than I have.

1252
01:30:57,038 --> 01:31:00,205
Always funny when it's happening
to some other guy, but not to me.

1253
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:02,368
What makes you think
I'd stand in your way?

1254
01:31:02,544 --> 01:31:05,379
You want him? Go to it.
Looks to me you're perfectly suited.

1255
01:31:05,547 --> 01:31:06,958
- Two slick articles.
- Help!

1256
01:31:07,132 --> 01:31:09,006
Too nice to you,
that's my mistake.

1257
01:31:09,176 --> 01:31:12,130
- Too considerate.
- Mike!

1258
01:31:12,346 --> 01:31:14,054
- Mike!
- Be quiet.

1259
01:31:14,222 --> 01:31:16,096
Help!

1260
01:31:16,558 --> 01:31:17,887
- Help!
- Pipe down, will you?

1261
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:20,811
You want everybody up here
and involve me in some kind...

1262
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:24,395
- No. No. Mike, help.
- Quiet down, will you?

1263
01:31:24,566 --> 01:31:27,769
You're hurting me.
Collier, leave me alone.

1264
01:31:27,945 --> 01:31:29,653
Leave me alone.

1265
01:31:29,822 --> 01:31:31,150
What are you, some wild man?

1266
01:31:31,323 --> 01:31:35,237
No, just the wrong jockey.
But I guess you're the right one, all right.

1267
01:31:35,411 --> 01:31:37,534
- What's he talking...?
- Oh, come, come, now.

1268
01:31:37,705 --> 01:31:41,287
- Let's not give it the innocent.
- You don't think that...!

1269
01:31:41,458 --> 01:31:43,914
Tell him, will you? Talk!

1270
01:31:44,086 --> 01:31:46,079
What's the use?

1271
01:31:47,214 --> 01:31:50,049
No use, that's the use.
Well, congratulations.

1272
01:31:50,217 --> 01:31:53,467
But I wouldn't be surprised
if I'm not the lucky guy.

1273
01:31:56,724 --> 01:31:59,476
- What do you figure got into him?
- I don't know.

1274
01:31:59,643 --> 01:32:01,222
- He frightened me.
- I can imagine.

1275
01:32:01,396 --> 01:32:04,267
- Why I called you.
- Well, you done the right thing. Did.

1276
01:32:04,441 --> 01:32:07,727
I mean, what would I have did
if you hadn't been around?

1277
01:32:07,903 --> 01:32:10,192
- Done.
- I figure you can take care of yourself.

1278
01:32:10,364 --> 01:32:12,855
- No, I can't.
- Yeah, I bet you could even lick me...

1279
01:32:13,033 --> 01:32:14,693
- No, I couldn't.
- Sure, I think so.

1280
01:32:14,868 --> 01:32:17,193
No, I couldn't.
I need someone to look after me.

1281
01:32:17,371 --> 01:32:19,992
- Yeah? What about me?
- Why not?

1282
01:32:20,958 --> 01:32:22,749
I don't know if I can lick you...

1283
01:32:22,918 --> 01:32:25,207
...but I'll tell you one thing I do know.

1284
01:32:25,379 --> 01:32:27,170
- What?
- Together we can lick them all.

1285
01:32:27,339 --> 01:32:28,668
You bet.

1286
01:32:34,096 --> 01:32:36,634
I can't handle this in my head.
It rocks me.

1287
01:32:36,807 --> 01:32:39,096
- Why?
- Well, be as it don't figure.

1288
01:32:39,268 --> 01:32:42,601
It's like as though Hucko walked in
and handed me an engagement ring.

1289
01:32:42,771 --> 01:32:44,894
- I'm not Hucko.
- No, that you ain't.

1290
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:47,272
- So?
- So I mean...

1291
01:32:47,443 --> 01:32:49,601
- There's one thing only about us.
- What?

1292
01:32:49,779 --> 01:32:52,566
Coming together,
that's what I call a plenty long shot.

1293
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:55,824
- Nothing wrong with a long shot.
- Lf you come out on top.

1294
01:32:55,993 --> 01:32:57,404
We will, Mike.

1295
01:32:57,578 --> 01:33:00,247
As somehow, you don't seem to...

1296
01:33:00,414 --> 01:33:04,163
An upper-cruster like you
and my kind of type...

1297
01:33:04,335 --> 01:33:06,791
...that can't even speak
left-handed English yet.

1298
01:33:06,963 --> 01:33:09,917
- The whole jismo, it's hard to believe.
- It's not hard for me.

1299
01:33:10,133 --> 01:33:13,548
- I think so.
- I know so.

1300
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:18,220
Okay, kid.

1301
01:33:18,391 --> 01:33:20,597
You got yourself a deal.

1302
01:33:31,696 --> 01:33:33,689
I'm gonna ask you
the three big questions.

1303
01:33:33,865 --> 01:33:35,489
- Go ahead.
- Who made you?

1304
01:33:35,658 --> 01:33:36,691
You did.

1305
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:49,831
- Who owns the biggest piece of you?
- You do.

1306
01:34:20,663 --> 01:34:23,830
- What would happen if I dropped you?
- I'd go right down the drain.

1307
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,538
- And?
- Take you right down with me, shorty.
