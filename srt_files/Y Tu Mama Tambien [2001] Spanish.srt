1
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,824
Promise you won't fuck
any Italians.

2
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:17,702
What are you talking about?

3
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,329
Or any gringo backpackers.

4
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,873
Gross!

5
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,333
Or any French fags.

6
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,501
No!

7
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:28,337
Or any of those dirty Mexicans

8
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,257
selling bracelets
on the Riviera.

9
00:01:31,383 --> 00:01:33,968
- Tenoch, come on!
- Nobody else!

10
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:36,012
Of course not.

11
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:40,016
- Promise me.
- I promise.

12
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,018
- What?
- You know.

13
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,811
Know what?

14
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,649
I promise...

15
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,276
I won't fuck...

16
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,694
any Chinamen!

17
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:55,031
- Don't bullshit me!
- Don't you trust me?

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,201
- Sure I do.
- Well, then?

19
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:03,206
- Promise me.
- What about you?

20
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,041
I promise too.

21
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,667
Prove it.

22
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,545
Let's say it together.

23
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,215
One...

24
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,383
two...

25
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,302
three:

26
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,554
I promise...

27
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:19,931
I won't...

28
00:02:20,057 --> 00:02:22,558
fuck...

29
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,727
any...

30
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,771
- Brazilians...
- Germans...

31
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:27,730
- Argentineans...
- Poles...

32
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:30,525
- Venezuelans...
- Irishmen...

33
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,276
or your father!

34
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,570
Are you crazy?

35
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,876
Ana's mother,
a French divorcée

36
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,420
and teacher
at the Institute for Foreigners,

37
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:55,550
didn't object to Tenoch staying over
and sleeping with her daughter.

38
00:02:56,134 --> 00:03:00,054
For Julio it was different.
He stayed at Cecilia's for dinner

39
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:04,851
but had to come back in the morning
for the trip to the airport.

40
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,230
Though he never said so,
Cecilia's father,

41
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,524
a pediatrician
specializing in allergies,

42
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,862
feared that his daughter's relationship
with Julio would go too far.

43
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,867
Her mother, a Lacanian psychologist,
welcomed their relationship

44
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:23,119
and felt it was innocent enough.

45
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:25,746
I can't believe it.
She lost her passport.

46
00:03:25,873 --> 00:03:27,540
She'll miss her plane!

47
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,168
Julio, come help me
find my passport!

48
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,921
Go on!
We're in a hurry!

49
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,635
Did you get the car out?

50
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,430
- Hurry, close the door!
- What about your passport?

51
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,473
Right here, stupid!

52
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,976
Come on, baby.

53
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,853
Hurry!

54
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:01,991
What a nice good-bye!

55
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,578
Tell me...

56
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,497
will you go out tonight?

57
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:11,626
No way, baby.
I'll be too lonely.

58
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:14,879
I'll be missing you like hell!

59
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,882
- Let's go!
- We have to leave!

60
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:19,050
Your mom!

61
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:22,303
I want to take
a little of you with me!

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,932
The plane's going to leave
without you!

63
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,892
Get off!

64
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:34,482
Did you find it?

65
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,859
- It's right here!
- Great!

66
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:40,821
- Hi, Maru.
- Hi.

67
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,534
- Have you seen Esteban?
- No.

68
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,956
Ana, come check in.

69
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,879
What's up, Charolastra?

70
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,548
I hate this good-bye bullshit.

71
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,425
Why don't they just go?

72
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,553
I'll miss her,
but this is too much.

73
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,890
- What's up, boys?
- Hey, how are you?

74
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:11,060
Did I overhear something
I shouldn't have?

75
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,897
- Princess.
- Dad, you came!

76
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:21,237
Ana's father was a journalist
recently turned politician.

77
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:24,240
He worked for the municipal
government in Mexico City

78
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:27,410
as Director of Logistics
in the Department of Culture.

79
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,412
Though he liked Tenoch,

80
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:34,000
he referred to him as "the preppie"
in front of his colleagues,

81
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,127
but never in front
of his daughter.

82
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:39,797
- I want to get on that plane.
- I want to be there already.

83
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:43,217
- I don't want you to go.
- I'll miss you so much.

84
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,386
I don't want to go, sweetie.

85
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,982
Smells like bread.

86
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,360
You pig!

87
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,070
Holy shit!

88
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,365
Enjoy your graduation present!

89
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,285
You should have flunked!

90
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,288
Don't be a baby.

91
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,416
So was your old man pissed?

92
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,835
He freaked.

93
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,213
If I don't take economics,
he'll take away the car.

94
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,924
You'd give up the Batmobile

95
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:26,510
because of a fucking course?

96
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:28,679
Fuck economists, man!

97
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:32,183
Those pricks
can suck my dick.

98
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,851
You're an idiot.

99
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,562
Fuck you.
I'm going to be a writer.

100
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,689
Switch to lit with me, man.

101
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,775
No fucking way!

102
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:45,946
Fucking traffic!

103
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:50,201
I bet my sister's
in another demonstration.

104
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:52,286
It's their right, Charolastra.

105
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:56,665
And it's my right
to tell 'em to fuck off!

106
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,459
I guess.

107
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:02,797
But left-wing chicks
are hot, dude.

108
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,840
Totally.

109
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,135
Are you wearing perfume?

110
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,433
You fucking pig!

111
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:17,686
Open the window!

112
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:25,528
There were three demonstrations
across the city that day.

113
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:29,990
But the traffic jam holding them up
had been caused

114
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:34,703
by Marcelino Escutia,
a migrant bricklayer from Michoacán.

115
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:39,750
Marcelino had been hit
by a speeding bus.

116
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:44,004
He never used the pedestrian bridge,
because its poor location

117
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:48,551
meant walking an extra
mile and a half to his work site.

118
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:52,555
His unidentified body was taken

119
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,141
to the city morgue,

120
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:58,102
where it went unclaimed
for four days.

121
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:06,235
Tenoch Iturbide
was the second of three children

122
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:10,447
born to a Harvard-trained economist
who became Undersecretary of State

123
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:15,369
and a housewife
given to esoteric spiritual practices.

124
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,541
His parents had decided
to name him Hernán,

125
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,878
but he was born the year his father
entered government service,

126
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,422
and seized by a sudden surge
of nationalism,

127
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,300
his father gave his son
an Aztec name, Tenoch.

128
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:32,469
Once we're stoned,
we'll drop a little "E."

129
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,723
I got some from Frisco
that's the absolute best.

130
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:37,433
Fuckin' A!

131
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:39,810
Total organic shit.

132
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,771
If Miriam comes,

133
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,609
I'll grab her by the ears
and fuck the shit out of her!

134
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,487
Miriam is a total babe.

135
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:53,199
At Rata's party
she was walking around

136
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,869
rubbing her ass
up against me, man.

137
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:59,371
Truth is,
she's kind of slutty.

138
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:03,125
The one I want to nail
is Shorty's chick.

139
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,794
She's got these little titties.

140
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,840
She's a total prime babe!

141
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,426
Not inside, man.

142
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,220
Let's go to the tower.

143
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,639
- What's the difference?
- They'll smell it!

144
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,521
Sticky.

145
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,232
A little harsh.

146
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,443
Crons.

147
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:34,073
It's strong shit.
It'll knock you on your ass.

148
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,576
- Tenoch!
- Get down!

149
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,579
How are you, ma'am?

150
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,831
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, sweetheart.

151
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,752
What's going on?
You're acting strange.

152
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,799
Are you boys sad?
Must be missing your girlfriends.

153
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:56,679
Cheer up. Your intense love
has clouded your auras.

154
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,556
Just think of them
and your hearts will connect.

155
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,850
Julio, are you coming
to Jessica's wedding?

156
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,186
I wouldn't miss it, ma'am.

157
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:09,191
You have to look very sharp.
The president will be there.

158
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,402
Tenoch,
get rid of that cigarette.

159
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:15,656
Evening, ma'am.
Your garden totally rules.

160
00:10:15,782 --> 00:10:17,950
Hi, Saba.
I didn't know you were here.

161
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,868
I'm everywhere.

162
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,208
That night, Julio and Tenoch
consumed alcohol,

163
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:29,837
marijuana, and Ecstasy
imported from San Francisco

164
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,132
and failed in their strategies
for sexual conquest.

165
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:37,344
They feared that this failure would set
the tone for the rest of the summer.

166
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,307
At 4:00 a.m.,
Julio threw up in the street.

167
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,767
Around 5:00,
Tenoch smashed a headlight

168
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:46,312
as he pulled into his driveway.

169
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:51,859
That same night, Saba had
his first experience with group sex.

170
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,326
A week went by,

171
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,245
and boredom
became their daily routine.

172
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:07,041
Tenoch's father was a majority
shareholder of a country club,

173
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,336
so his son had access
to the facilities on Mondays,

174
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,588
when the club
was closed for maintenance.

175
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,889
One, two, three!

176
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:09,395
You're too eager to beat me.
You use up your air right away.

177
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:13,315
Like you're the pro.
You beat me by two yards.

178
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,317
Two? Ten at least!

179
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:18,946
- Four max.
- Let's call it eight.

180
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,490
You're full of shit.

181
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:25,494
I may be full of shit,

182
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,540
but you've got
one ugly dick!

183
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,127
Looks like
a deflated balloon.

184
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,213
So blow it up, asshole!

185
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:38,132
Back off, faggot!

186
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:40,884
Come on,
blow up the balloon!

187
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,767
Six, seven...

188
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,895
eight, nine, ten, eleven!

189
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,148
There are more bodyguards
than guests!

190
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,025
Count 'em!
The Comonforts brought three,

191
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,112
the Guerreros three...
- Don't point.

192
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,031
two for my dad's boss,

193
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,534
and a shitload
for the president.

194
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,870
- Don't forget Herminio.
- He's my driver!

195
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:10,247
He still packs a gun, man.

196
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,044
Smart move, sir.
Your son's already plastered.

197
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,881
Dad, I already said hi
to the president.

198
00:13:19,007 --> 00:13:21,383
The Gonzalez kids
are looking for you.

199
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,510
Be nice to them, please.

200
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,846
They're always
very nice to you.

201
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:27,890
Okay, Dad.

202
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,310
The Gonzalez kids!
Remember that fat girl?

203
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:35,606
How are you, sweet pea?
It's been ages.

204
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:46,533
- What a bunch of assholes, right?
- Whatever you say, sir.

205
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,245
A rum and Coke,
light on the Coke.

206
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:02,424
You remember your cousin?
He wants to be a writer too.

207
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,011
I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

208
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:08,138
Cheers!

209
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,808
The old bag!

210
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,479
Last time I saw you,
you were a little kid

211
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:18,774
bawling because you wanted
a Ninja Turtle.

212
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,860
- A Thunder Cat.
- Excuse me. A Thunder Cat.

213
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,987
So you want to be a writer?

214
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,281
And tell stories
about rich brats?

215
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,534
No, about assholes like you.

216
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:31,119
It's one thing
to write preppy stories.

217
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,580
It's another
to create literature.

218
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,375
- So when do you start?
- Did you read my book?

219
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,294
- I read the reviews.
- Critics are assholes.

220
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:44,800
Alejandro Montes de Oca ‒ "Jano" ‒
was the nephew of Tenoch's mother.

221
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:47,761
His father died
when he was three,

222
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,180
leaving him
in his mother's suffocating care,

223
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,268
which he finally escaped by going
abroad for a graduate degree.

224
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,813
He was now back
after 10 years.

225
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,984
Give it some serious thought.
You really want to be a writer?

226
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:04,653
Anyone can put
words on paper,

227
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:07,990
but it takes a lifetime
to become a writer.

228
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,450
This is my cousin, the writer.

229
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:13,912
It's not just
about discipline and technique.

230
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:16,623
You have to create
your own style.

231
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:20,043
And for that
you need life experience.

232
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,630
Honestly, what do you
know about life?

233
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,924
Yeah, what do you know?

234
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,177
Little bastards!

235
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,346
We're sorry.

236
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:41,607
I'd like to thank you all

237
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:45,235
for joining us
in this humble celebration,

238
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:51,658
and in particular, the president
of our country and his lovely wife,

239
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,495
who took time
from a busy schedule

240
00:15:55,622 --> 00:16:01,001
to share in this special moment
for Jessica and Francisco Javier.

241
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:05,631
Your presence here today
is testimony

242
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:08,050
to your great modesty.

243
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:12,054
With the permission
of all of you,

244
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,516
I'd like to wish the bride and groom
every happiness.

245
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:20,729
She's hot!

246
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,025
Hi. Nice to meet you.

247
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,320
- Hi.
- How are you?

248
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,073
Is this boring or what?

249
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,325
Not even a little?

250
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,494
Well, a little.

251
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:40,374
- Where are you from?
- Madrid. Spain.

252
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,709
Cool!
What brings you here?

253
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,795
My husband's in the family.

254
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:47,381
- Which side?
- The bride's side.

255
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,425
Luisa, you see what they did?

256
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,135
You little prick.

257
00:16:54,847 --> 00:17:00,644
Luisa Cortés lost her parents
in a car accident when she was 10.

258
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,607
She was raised by her great-aunt,
a spinster and Franco supporter

259
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:10,445
who later fell ill and was in Luisa's care
for the last five years of her life.

260
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,783
Luisa lived with her until she was 20,
when she married Jano.

261
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,705
A few months later, her aunt died ‒
Luisa's last living relative.

262
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:23,291
- What happened?
- It was those two brats!

263
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,419
You can't meet
the president like this.

264
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:28,672
- Salt will take it ‒
- I'll meet him some other time.

265
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,967
- No, we'll find you another suit.
- A little... salt...

266
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,970
Luisa, take this.

267
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,181
Careful!
And keep an eye on my mother.

268
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,268
Hey, is that your husband?

269
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:45,397
- Yes. Why?
- He's my cousin.

270
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,734
- What's your name?
- Tenoch.

271
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:52,237
You're little Tenoch?

272
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:57,409
I met you when I visited years ago.
You were a tiny thing,

273
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:01,121
bawling because
you wanted a Thunder Cat.

274
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,540
You have a good memory.
Cigarette?

275
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,334
Thanks.
You're quite the grown man now.

276
00:18:06,461 --> 00:18:08,044
Thank you.

277
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:11,965
So... uh... how long
have you been here?

278
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:14,134
About a month.

279
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:17,804
Jano's teaching at the university
starting in September.

280
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,515
You two plan
on doing any traveling?

281
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,560
Jano's leaving
for a symposium

282
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:27,564
while I get us settled in
and do a few job interviews.

283
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,693
But if there's time, I hope
to get to the beach. And you?

284
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,820
We're going to the beach.

285
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,365
Puerto Escondido, right?
Jano's told me about it.

286
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,869
No, that place sucks.

287
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:45,332
It's all yuppie backpackers
and wanna-be surfers.

288
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:50,045
We go to a place
only the local fishermen know.

289
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,548
What's it called?

290
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,219
- Uh... Heaven's ‒ what is it?
- Mouth?

291
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,056
Heaven's Mouth! Totally.

292
00:19:01,182 --> 00:19:04,184
- It's like paradise.
- Better than paradise!

293
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,603
It's a slice of heaven
here on earth.

294
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,814
A tropical heaven!

295
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:12,317
A slice of heaven
right here on earth!

296
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,653
Putting down roots
in the earth!

297
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,822
She should come along.

298
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,074
Sure. Why don't you come?

299
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,409
Me? You'd take me along?

300
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,621
- Of course.
- Is there somewhere to sleep?

301
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,414
Somewhere to sleep?

302
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,875
Just the silky warm sand

303
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,920
beneath a starry sky.

304
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:34,339
There are coconuts
to drink from,

305
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:37,759
but we'll bring some 40s.
- What's that?

306
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,678
Big bottles of beer.

307
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,847
Jano will love it.

308
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,433
The mariachis.

309
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,154
The president left an hour later.

310
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:02,742
He had an urgent meeting
with the leaders of his party

311
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:06,288
to appoint candidates
for upcoming elections.

312
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,540
The next day...

313
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,377
he would express his outrage
at the Cerro Verde massacre

314
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:16,464
and deny that the state governor
had been involved in any way.

315
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:20,302
After offering condolences
to the victims' relatives,

316
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:24,806
he would fly to Seattle
for a world summit on globalization.

317
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:30,228
The days passed, and while Jano
was away at his symposium,

318
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:33,982
Luisa went to the doctor
for some test results.

319
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:38,278
In the waiting room
she took a magazine quiz entitled...

320
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,697
"Are You
a Fully Realized Woman?"

321
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:45,410
It was multiple choice.
For Question 1 she chose B:

322
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:49,289
"I prefer to be awake
rather than sleeping or dreaming."

323
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,708
For Question 4 she chose C:

324
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,337
"I value time more highly
than money or power."

325
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,589
For Question 7, she chose A:

326
00:20:57,715 --> 00:21:01,426
"I think more about the present
than the past or the future."

327
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,970
She scored 16 points.

328
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,850
The magazine rated her as
"a woman afraid to claim her freedom."

329
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,977
Luisa didn't agree.

330
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:18,026
Think about Conchita's titties,
those hard nipples.

331
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,945
Nice!

332
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:23,365
Mayela's pussy, man...

333
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:26,618
all wet and hairy.

334
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,955
- Your girlfriend's mom.
- Shut up!

335
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,165
That art teacher.

336
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:34,209
Miss Georgina.

337
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:36,878
She never wore panties.

338
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,547
Salma Hayek, man.

339
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,716
Yeah, Salmita!

340
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,052
Your cousin, man.

341
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:45,720
What cousin?

342
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:48,431
The Spanish chick!

343
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,372
Hello?

344
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,125
Hello?

345
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,127
Love?

346
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:18,670
Jano?

347
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:23,049
Are you all right?

348
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,932
I'm so drunk.

349
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,810
Then go to bed.
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

350
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,146
I'll be back in two days.

351
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:38,565
I love you so much.

352
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,859
I love you too.

353
00:22:40,985 --> 00:22:43,153
I'm an asshole!

354
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,697
I'm such a piece of shit!

355
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,659
Jano, go to bed.
You're drunk.

356
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,911
I'm such a shit!

357
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:55,123
Calm down.
What's wrong?

358
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,001
Are you okay, darling?

359
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,547
I slept with another woman.

360
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:06,634
What?

361
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,220
I tell you,
I'm a piece of shit!

362
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:17,353
Why are you telling me this?

363
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,898
I love you so fucking much.

364
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,776
Why are you telling me this?

365
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:33,805
Here's your sandwich, sweetie,
with your favorite cheese.

366
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,974
Thanks, Leo.

367
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,436
One moment, please.

368
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:42,856
It's for you.

369
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:52,073
- Hello?
- Tenoch? It's Luisa.

370
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,826
- Who?
- Luisa, from Spain.

371
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:58,413
Yeah, right.
How are you?

372
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:02,542
I'm glad I caught you,
since you said you were leaving today.

373
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:05,670
- Leaving?
- For Heaven's Mouth.

374
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,507
Oh, right.
We're leaving this afternoon.

375
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,634
And you're all ready?

376
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,137
We're getting ready right now.

377
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,098
I was wondering...

378
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,020
is the invitation still open?

379
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,065
Hello?
- It's just that...

380
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:29,319
I guess not.
That's okay. Never mind.

381
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,446
Wait ‒ yes, it is!

382
00:25:31,614 --> 00:25:33,865
No, I don't want to bother you.

383
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,159
No bother at all.

384
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,828
Just tell us
where to pick you up.

385
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:44,459
I live at 52 Machu Picchu Street,
Apartment 3D.

386
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:56,262
Still asleep, you lazy fuck?

387
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:01,309
Yeah, I was up till 3:00
watching videos.

388
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:04,479
Get your ass in gear.
We're going to the beach.

389
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,898
- What beach?
- Heaven's Mouth.

390
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,651
There's no such place, man!

391
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:12,237
I know,
but Luisa wants to go.

392
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,031
- Luisa who?
- The Spaniard.

393
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,991
You shittin' me?

394
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:19,494
No way.
Can you get the car?

395
00:26:19,662 --> 00:26:21,579
It'll never make it.

396
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:24,791
The radiator's fucked,
and the battery too.

397
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:28,211
Plus it's my sister's turn to use it.
Let's take yours.

398
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,088
My dad took it away

399
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,799
'cause I broke the headlight
and I won't take economics.

400
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,550
What a prick.

401
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:38,304
Julio Zapata lived
with his mother and sister.

402
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,600
He hadn't seen his father
since he was five.

403
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:46,396
His mother had worked
all her life as a secretary

404
00:26:46,522 --> 00:26:48,648
in a multinational corporation.

405
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:54,737
His sister, Manuela,
was a political science major

406
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:59,367
at the National University
of Mexico.

407
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:05,290
After tense negotiations, she agreed
to let Julio use the car for five days.

408
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,917
Then she would have it
for three weeks

409
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,545
so she and her friends
could deliver

410
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,214
food, clothing,
and medicine in Chiapas.

411
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,970
- Beer!
- Brewskis!

412
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,312
Condoms!

413
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,940
- Where's your size?
- In the deli, with the giant salamis.

414
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:40,450
Once you pass Puebla,
get off the toll road.

415
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:42,869
The landscape is awesome.

416
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,495
Got it.

417
00:27:44,747 --> 00:27:48,583
Then follow this road.

418
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:51,377
That's no road, asshole!
It's a river!

419
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,713
You're sending us to Veracruz!

420
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,882
Where is it, man?

421
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:59,469
Take the road to Oaxaca,

422
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:03,056
but keep your eyes peeled
for checkpoints.

423
00:28:03,182 --> 00:28:05,558
Stuff your stash
where they can't find it,

424
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,269
and drive
like a little old lady.

425
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,688
Saba, we're in a hurry!

426
00:28:11,482 --> 00:28:13,900
It's a total trip, man!

427
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:18,696
You pass this shack
with this massive Coke bottle on top.

428
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,740
Remember I told you?

429
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:23,117
Saba, then what?

430
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,286
What?

431
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,289
The beach, asshole!

432
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,124
That's what I'm saying!

433
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:34,128
Take the dirt road on the right
all the way to the end,

434
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,631
and there it is.

435
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,812
Yes?

436
00:28:51,313 --> 00:28:53,106
I'll be right down.

437
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:20,693
Stop it.

438
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,738
Hey, don't kick my car!

439
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:28,910
So what do you do?

440
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:30,745
What do I look like?

441
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:32,413
- A sociologist.
- Cold.

442
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,290
Philosopher?

443
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:36,334
Cold.

444
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,128
- Psychologist?
- You think?

445
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,756
- A Victoria's Secret model?
- Freezing!

446
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,382
We give up.

447
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,385
I'm a certified dental technician.

448
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:48,137
What's that?

449
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:51,265
They suck out your drool
at the dentist's.

450
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:52,934
Right?
- Yes.

451
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,770
- Why'd you pick that?
- It wasn't my fantasy, okay?

452
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,397
Believe me,
when I played with dolls,

453
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:01,234
I didn't pretend
to suck out their drool.

454
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,779
- Then why?
- I was living with my aunt.

455
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,323
When I was 16,
she got very sick,

456
00:31:07,449 --> 00:31:09,617
and I had to find work fast.

457
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,286
In four months I had
a dental technician's certificate.

458
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:14,872
But what did you really
want to do?

459
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:17,333
I never did very well
in school.

460
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:19,961
The one thing
I always wanted to do

461
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,129
was travel

462
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,632
and see the world.

463
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,468
Yeah, taking trips is awesome.

464
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,806
On acid, maybe.
You've never been on a plane!

465
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,976
- I have too!
- Three times.

466
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,521
You really thought
I was a philosopher?

467
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,648
You look like a thinker.

468
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:42,817
And you're married to Jano.

469
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,529
Luisa often accompanied Jano
to dinners

470
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:49,240
with his artistic
and intellectual friends,

471
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,826
but she never felt
very comfortable.

472
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:56,622
There was always someone,
perhaps well-meaning, perhaps not,

473
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,876
who would press Luisa for an opinion
during their discussions.

474
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:03,588
She always replied modestly,

475
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,090
"I don't know anything
about these things."

476
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,011
She often thought
about challenging the guests

477
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,889
to see if any of them could name
every tooth in the right order.

478
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,058
She never dared.

479
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,815
Hey, Charolastra,
pass the munchies.

480
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,526
- Charo what?
- Charolastra.

481
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:28,404
"Charo" is kind of
a Mexican cowboy,

482
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,865
so it's something
like "astral cowboy."

483
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:35,661
Actually, Daniel didn't understand
the lyrics to an English song that went...

484
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,706
Charolastra, charolo

485
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:45,171
But it was really Saba
who came up with it

486
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:47,173
while on mushrooms.

487
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,384
So Daniel and Saba
are Charolastras too?

488
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:54,722
Yeah, but lately Saba's
gotten way into altered states

489
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,183
and expanding
his consciousness.

490
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:00,019
- You mean mysticism?
- No, drugs.

491
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,480
He's turning into a pain.

492
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:06,692
And we hardly ever see Daniel
since he came out of the closet.

493
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,736
Does that bother you?

494
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:12,198
No, he's just
into other scenes now.

495
00:33:12,324 --> 00:33:14,408
But he's still in the club.

496
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,578
There's Pecas too,
but she's just an honorary member,

497
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:20,373
because of her
totally sucky boyfriends.

498
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,668
- She wouldn't sign our manifesto.
- You have a manifesto?

499
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,878
- Sure.
- What's it say?

500
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,756
- No, top secret.
- I won't tell anyone.

501
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:32,176
- No, my lips are sealed.
- We'd have to kill you.

502
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:36,597
"One: There's no greater honor
than being a Charolastra.

503
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:39,517
Two: Do whatever the fuck
you feel like.

504
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,936
Three: Pop beats poetry.

505
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:44,605
Four: Getting high once a day
keeps the doctor away."

506
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,440
That was Saba's idea.

507
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,943
"Five: Thou shalt not screw
another Charolastra's girl.

508
00:33:49,111 --> 00:33:51,278
Six:
Team América is for fags.

509
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,406
Seven: Whacking off rules.

510
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:55,533
Eight: Never marry a virgin.

511
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,785
Nine: Team América is ‒"

512
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,454
- You said that.
- It bears repeating.

513
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,833
It's for fags.
- It's a crappy team.

514
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,877
- "Ten: Truth is cool, but unattainable."
- What?

515
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:11,132
It means truth is totally amazing,
but fuck if you can ever reach it.

516
00:34:11,258 --> 00:34:13,134
"And eleven:

517
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,804
The asshole who breaks
any of the above rules

518
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:20,099
forfeits the title of 'Charolastra."'

519
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:24,937
You should share your manifesto
with the government.

520
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,817
No, politicians are assholes.

521
00:34:30,694 --> 00:34:33,821
Julio and Tenoch told Luisa
lots of other stories.

522
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,450
Each one reaffirmed
the strong ties uniting them,

523
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:41,245
the bond that created
a solid, indivisible entity.

524
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:48,002
Their stories, though adorned by
personal mythologies, were the truth.

525
00:34:48,128 --> 00:34:52,006
But as always happens,
it was a partial truth.

526
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,011
Much was omitted, such as how
Julio lit matches to hide the smell

527
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:00,014
after using the bathroom
at Tenoch's house.

528
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:04,852
Or how Tenoch used his foot
to lift the toilet seat at Julio's house.

529
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,939
Those were details they didn't need
to know about each other.

530
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,068
Do you have girlfriends?

531
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,321
- Yes. Ceci.
- Ana Bananas.

532
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,782
Bananas?
Where are they now?

533
00:35:17,908 --> 00:35:21,160
Traveling around Europe.
They're best friends.

534
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:25,039
- Where in Europe?
- Mostly around Italy.

535
00:35:25,165 --> 00:35:28,709
- Lucky girls.
- Yeah, they say it's awesome.

536
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,086
- That's not why.
- Why?

537
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:33,339
Why do you think
girls go to Italy?

538
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:35,382
- The clothes?
- For a vacation.

539
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:38,302
The guys!
Italian men are sexy.

540
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:42,807
- No, you don't know our chicks.
- Fuckin' right!

541
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,518
Ceci would never cheat on me.

542
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:49,021
She wanted to tattoo
my name on her right tit,

543
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,273
but her mother said no.

544
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,944
I popped Ana's cherry.
I'm the only guy she wants.

545
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,029
Glad to hear it.

546
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,866
Your girls are lucky
to have such cool boyfriends.

547
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:04,578
And are Charolastras faithful?

548
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,330
Absolutely.

549
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,582
As it should be, right?

550
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,001
Have you ever cheated
on Jano?

551
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:14,380
Me, be unfaithful?
Please!

552
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,591
Listen, I'm starving.
- Yeah, they're coming.

553
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:20,135
Has he ever cheated on you?

554
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:25,641
Jano has always needed
affirmation.

555
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:29,103
- Seriously?
- Get some beers.

556
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:32,273
- One for me too.
- Where did you meet him?

557
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:34,608
In a bar in Madrid.

558
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:38,445
I bet he was wasted,
talkin' a lot of shit.

559
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:41,740
No, it was me
who was wasted.

560
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:44,618
Me and my girlfriends.
- Really?

561
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,705
So what happened?

562
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:52,710
I saw this sharp-looking guy,
full of attitude.

563
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:57,381
I guess I fell
for his cute Mexican accent.

564
00:36:57,507 --> 00:37:00,092
- No, no.
- I have change.

565
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,261
What did you see in him?

566
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,263
I don't know.

567
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:06,807
We have a lot in common.

568
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,642
Like what?

569
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,561
Well, like...

570
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:14,732
he has no father,
and I'm an orphan.

571
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:20,905
His mother is really overbearing,
just like my aunt was.

572
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:27,036
Those five years I took care of her
were awful. Poor woman.

573
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:31,290
Only Jano was at my side
through thick and thin.

574
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,002
Anyway, cheers.
- Cheers.

575
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:39,256
Good evening.
What would you like?

576
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:12,831
Thanks.
See you in the morning.

577
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,842
- Shit!
- You get the smaller one.

578
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:27,638
How 'bout a joint?
- Coming right up.

579
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:31,809
Hey, you think Ana and Ceci
are fucking any Italians?

580
00:38:31,935 --> 00:38:33,602
No way, man.

581
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:36,438
There's piss all over in here.

582
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,900
They're not, right?
- Nah.

583
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,403
Italians are fags anyway.

584
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,071
Totally.

585
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,283
Think your cousin
wants to get laid?

586
00:38:49,077 --> 00:38:52,830
Seems Jano's been cheating
on her big-time.

587
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,458
We oughta try
to ease her pain,

588
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:59,086
put a smile back
on her face.

589
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,630
- Let's go.
- Where?

590
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:35,873
Hey, guys!

591
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,000
Coming.

592
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:41,587
You still in bed?

593
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,797
Come on,
let's get to the beach.

594
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:46,800
Come on, lazy shit.

595
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,053
Julio, the beach.

596
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,265
Now?

597
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:59,271
Nice!
Our daily early-bird special.

598
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,191
- Can you guys drive stoned?
- Sure.

599
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,361
You won't even feel the curves.

600
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,786
- It's been so long.
- You'll be flying like the Concorde.

601
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:18,290
It's potent monkey shit.

602
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,502
Pretty tasty for monkey shit.

603
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,801
Sticky.

604
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,178
- You smoke a lot?
- Now and then. You?

605
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:34,014
- Not usually.
- A joint and a beer...

606
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,310
Tenoch realized
he'd never visited Tepelmeme,

607
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:43,232
the birthplace of Leodegaria Victoria ‒
Leo, his nanny ‒

608
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:46,860
who migrated to Mexico City
when she was 13.

609
00:40:47,529 --> 00:40:50,197
She found work
with Tenoch's family

610
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,992
and had cared for him
since he was born.

611
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,495
He called her "Mommy"
until he was four.

612
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,832
Tenoch didn't share this
with the others.

613
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,084
Give me another hit.

614
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,211
There's plenty for everyone.

615
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:08,715
- I saw you guys last night.
- What?

616
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,427
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, what?

617
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,433
You think it's cool to spy
on women in their hotel rooms?

618
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:22,521
- It was his idea.
- Is that right?

619
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:25,983
And you just went along?

620
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,194
Did you hope to see me naked?
- No way.

621
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,239
See me naked
and go whack off.

622
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:34,658
How can you say that?

623
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:37,619
Tell me something.

624
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:42,875
Have you made love to many girls
besides your girlfriends?

625
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,460
- A few.
- Bullshit!

626
00:41:46,796 --> 00:41:49,464
He's only fucked his chick.

627
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:52,092
- You're wrong, asshole.
- Who else?

628
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,262
Flavia.

629
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,181
That's bullshit!

630
00:41:57,307 --> 00:42:01,935
You blew your load
putting on the condom!

631
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,313
You told me so yourself.

632
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,148
A donation for our queen?

633
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,483
- What about you, Tenoch?
- What?

634
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:12,613
Have you made love
with other girls?

635
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,406
Two or three.

636
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,617
- Two or three skanks.
- "Skanks"?

637
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:20,120
- Whores.
- You sleep with whores?

638
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,956
Your queen is beautiful!

639
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,000
I don't sleep with whores.

640
00:42:25,126 --> 00:42:27,169
You do too!
You're a whore-chaser!

641
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:45,229
Did you fuck many guys
before you met Jano?

642
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:48,732
I started late
and met Jano very early on.

643
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:52,194
So you were a virgin?

644
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,114
No, I had a boyfriend
before him.

645
00:42:56,241 --> 00:43:00,327
And he was
rammin' you hard, right?

646
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,455
- Actually, yes.
- Really?

647
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,917
The first time,
he took me to a factory

648
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:09,336
where his uncle worked
as a security guard.

649
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:12,214
I was so scared.
I barely knew him.

650
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:16,134
I thought
he wanted to kiss me...

651
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,679
but he deflowered me.

652
00:43:19,973 --> 00:43:24,434
It hurt so bad!
I told myself I'd never do it again.

653
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:29,189
But every time we got together,
we'd go at it like rabbits.

654
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:34,194
I thought he just wanted sex.

655
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,364
Don't tell me ‒
he wanted to talk too?

656
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,075
- He really fell in love with me.
- Of course.

657
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:42,703
He'd pick me up
from school every day

658
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,455
on his motorcycle,
in his leather jacket.

659
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,541
How original!

660
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:49,334
I loved it.

661
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,545
I'd always play hooky.

662
00:43:51,671 --> 00:43:53,505
Hooky?

663
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,549
That too!

664
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:58,802
No, "playing hooky"
means cutting class.

665
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,722
I just wanted to be with him.

666
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:07,477
We'd go to amazing spots
and cruise around on his motorcycle.

667
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:12,399
We planned to go
to the French Riviera.

668
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:14,109
Me too.

669
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:17,612
A friend had found him work
there as a waiter.

670
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,574
We had everything
packed and ready.

671
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:25,495
He had a ponytail,
a broken tooth,

672
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,582
and an earring
in his right ear.

673
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,710
I was so in love with him.

674
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,796
So in love.

675
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:38,216
Then Jano came along
and stole you.

676
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,761
- No.
- So what happened?

677
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:43,096
He was killed
in a bike accident.

678
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,724
Shit.

679
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,310
He was 17.

680
00:44:53,316 --> 00:44:56,443
If they'd passed that same spot
10 years earlier,

681
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,614
they'd have come across
some cages scattered in the road...

682
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:05,285
and then driven
through a cloud of white feathers.

683
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:08,997
Five yards further on,
a pile of broken cages

684
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,876
filled with bleeding chickens
flapping their wings.

685
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:17,297
Then an overturned truck,
still smoldering.

686
00:45:18,758 --> 00:45:22,886
Just beyond that,
two lifeless bodies in the road,

687
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:26,515
one smaller than the other,
barely covered by a jacket,

688
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:30,227
and next to them,
a woman crying inconsolably.

689
00:45:50,123 --> 00:45:52,290
Give me another cigarette.

690
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:21,570
- Don't! This song rules!
- The batteries are dead.

691
00:46:23,156 --> 00:46:25,866
Turn the radio on.

692
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:30,120
Shit. Hide the stash.

693
00:46:30,246 --> 00:46:32,080
It's cool, man.

694
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,125
Don't look at them.

695
00:46:35,251 --> 00:46:38,753
Jeez, they got busted.

696
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:42,007
Don't turn around!

697
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,836
What's up?

698
00:47:23,466 --> 00:47:28,261
Good heavens!
Your friend woke up too.

699
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,848
It's the heat.

700
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,726
You got a woody?

701
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:37,854
- And how!
- That little weenie?

702
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,566
It's only a quarter inch
shorter than yours.

703
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,235
A quarter inch?

704
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,612
Dream on!

705
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,532
- You measured them?
- Yeah. But his is butt-ugly.

706
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:52,285
- How so?
- It's got a freakin' hood.

707
00:47:52,453 --> 00:47:56,623
- A hood ‒ yummy!
- You see?

708
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,792
The dude's got an ugly one.

709
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:07,050
How do you make love
to your girlfriends?

710
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:10,262
Super suave. Passionately.

711
00:48:10,388 --> 00:48:13,473
- With a twist.
- A twist?

712
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:16,726
A twist... of the hips.

713
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,437
But how do you turn them on?

714
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:23,316
First a little foreplay
to heat up the oven.

715
00:48:23,526 --> 00:48:28,530
Some kisses on the titties,
a few love bites.

716
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,824
And then?

717
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:35,161
Then I ram it in all the way.

718
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:36,621
What else?

719
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:40,542
I bang her
till she begs for mercy.

720
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,669
- Is that it?
- Is that it!

721
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:46,965
Ceci twists and moans
like an oyster in lime juice.

722
00:48:47,091 --> 00:48:49,801
- Ana cries.
- Poor thing!

723
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,804
- I mean from pleasure.
- Oh, I'm sure.

724
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:55,140
Missionary position, or what?

725
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:58,435
Missionary,
doggie-style, everything.

726
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:02,856
Ana likes to be on top.
We do it sitting up too.

727
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,483
Even 69.

728
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:07,902
The whole Kama Sutra.

729
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,196
I know every trick.

730
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,285
You ever wiggle your finger...

731
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:18,288
up her ass?
- Her ass?

732
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:49,402
No way!

733
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,322
It has to come
from San Rafael.

734
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:54,908
- When will it be ready?
- Maybe tomorrow.

735
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,037
No, but thank you very much.

736
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,249
- Cool hat.
- Yes, it's a nice one.

737
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:06,211
You can have it.

738
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:09,923
Really?
You're giving it to me?

739
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:11,549
Thanks.

740
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,766
Your coconut.

741
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:28,274
Thank you.

742
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,555
That's my name.

743
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:01,099
Luisita.

744
00:51:01,225 --> 00:51:03,560
Pretty name.

745
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:10,734
Hi, Jano. I know
you're not back until tomorrow.

746
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,238
I'm calling because I didn't leave a note.
Maybe I meant to worry you.

747
00:51:16,532 --> 00:51:20,326
I wanted to vanish from your life
with no warning,

748
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:22,912
but now I realize that
that's not right.

749
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,039
So this is my note,

750
00:51:25,166 --> 00:51:28,418
though I honestly
don't know what to say.

751
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:32,005
I met a woman today
named Doña Martina.

752
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:36,593
She's 98, and she remembers
everything since she was five.

753
00:51:36,844 --> 00:51:39,220
Imagine everything
she's experienced...

754
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:44,184
and everything a person
never gets to experience.

755
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:49,397
Your mother sent the mousse you like.
It's in the fridge.

756
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:53,359
Be sure to pay the phone bill.
I left it on your desk.

757
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,738
And pick up your shirts
from the cleaners.

758
00:51:56,864 --> 00:52:00,784
But don't go to them anymore.
They ruin the clothes.

759
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:03,203
Anyway...

760
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:05,538
take care of yourself.

761
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,545
See you later.

762
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,138
Hand me some shampoo, man.

763
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:26,726
Please.

764
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,833
Oh, sorry.

765
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,668
It's all right. Come in.

766
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,963
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

767
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:59,676
It must be the heat
and the long drive.

768
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:03,263
I came to see
if you had any shampoo.

769
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,682
You got any?

770
00:53:11,564 --> 00:53:13,356
Take off the towel.

771
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,525
What?

772
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,862
Take it off.

773
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:22,824
- The towel?
- Yes, the towel.

774
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,246
Take it off, Tenoch.

775
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:33,543
No, don't cover up.

776
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,173
You get excited quickly, huh?

777
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,842
I guess.

778
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:45,638
You lied.
It curves to the left.

779
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:46,806
What?

780
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:50,810
You said it curved right,
but it curves left.

781
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,480
It's just like I imagined.

782
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,526
Why don't you jerk off?

783
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:01,529
Jerk off? Here?

784
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,489
That's right. Jerk off.

785
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:07,201
Want me to help you?

786
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:11,205
Want to see my tits?
- Yes.

787
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,294
Only if you touch yourself.

788
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:22,467
Come here.

789
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,013
Closer.

790
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:55,375
I'm all wet.
You want to feel it?

791
00:54:57,461 --> 00:54:59,253
Feel me.

792
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,804
Eat me out, Tenoch.

793
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,728
Tenoch,
take my panties off first.

794
00:55:26,699 --> 00:55:28,658
No, come here.

795
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,730
¡Mamacita!

796
00:56:05,654 --> 00:56:06,988
I'm sorry.

797
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:10,283
It's all right. Don't worry.

798
00:56:30,471 --> 00:56:33,264
Julio couldn't understand
what he was feeling.

799
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:35,224
He knew it wasn't rage.

800
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:40,021
The only other time he'd felt this pain
in his gut was when he was eight,

801
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,691
when he woke up thirsty one night
and on his way to the kitchen

802
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:47,820
saw his mother in the living room
in his godfather's arms.

803
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:52,033
Julio had walked away quietly

804
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,203
and never mentioned
the incident to anyone.

805
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,005
What's up, dude?

806
00:57:06,465 --> 00:57:07,673
Not much.

807
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,675
Feel like racing?

808
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,470
No, it's full of leaves.

809
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,972
We can clean 'em out
in no time.

810
00:57:20,187 --> 00:57:21,687
Let's go.

811
00:58:07,151 --> 00:58:09,152
You let me win, asshole.

812
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:16,409
There was no reason to.

813
00:58:17,578 --> 00:58:19,495
I fucked Ana.

814
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,539
What?

815
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:26,169
You heard me.
I fucked your girlfriend.

816
00:58:29,047 --> 00:58:34,260
Tenoch had only felt this pain
in his gut when he was 11,

817
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:37,805
when he saw his father's picture
in an article linking him

818
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:42,935
to a scandal involving the sale
of contaminated corn to the poor.

819
00:58:43,562 --> 00:58:47,815
Tenoch and his family moved
to Vancouver for eight months.

820
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,777
He never asked why.

821
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,959
No one told Luisa
about Julio's confession,

822
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:11,839
but over dinner she could feel
the tension between the two friends.

823
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:15,343
She sensed that her transgression
had disrupted a natural balance

824
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:17,803
that only she could restore.

825
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,889
Good night.

826
00:59:23,602 --> 00:59:25,436
Good night, Tenoch.

827
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:41,786
What's up?
Weren't you gonna sleep with Luisa?

828
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:43,663
Fuck off.

829
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:12,024
How many times
did you fuck her?

830
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,319
Just once.
We were really wasted.

831
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,196
- When?
- Forget about it.

832
01:00:17,322 --> 01:00:19,365
Tell me when.

833
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:21,242
I don't know.

834
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,996
How could you not know,
asshole?

835
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,165
When you went to Lake Tahoe.

836
01:00:29,251 --> 01:00:31,460
Where was Cecilia?

837
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:33,212
Sick.

838
01:00:33,505 --> 01:00:36,382
- Where did you do it? Her house?
- No.

839
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,217
Then where?

840
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,388
- I think it was at a party.
- What party, asshole?

841
01:00:42,556 --> 01:00:44,473
I don't know.

842
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:48,060
I think the party
at Fruit Loop's place.

843
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:52,732
You mean when Saba
kicked his ass?

844
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,901
I think so.

845
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:59,655
- What are you laughing about, fucker?
- About Saba.

846
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,949
Stop laughing, faggot!

847
01:01:02,409 --> 01:01:04,410
Who started it?

848
01:01:04,536 --> 01:01:07,705
Both of us.
We were shit-faced, man.

849
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:12,084
Where'd you do it?

850
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:14,712
In his little sister's room.

851
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:19,967
What was Ana wearing?

852
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:22,094
Christ, I don't remember!

853
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,138
Skirt or pants?

854
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,975
What panties was she wearing?
- What?

855
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:32,104
- What panties, asshole!
- White ones.

856
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:35,191
- Did she blow you, you pig?
- Of course not!

857
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,110
Look me in the eyes!
Did she blow you?

858
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:41,781
Did you eat her out?
- Of course not!

859
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:43,699
Did she come?

860
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,119
How would I know?
It all happened so fast.

861
01:01:47,287 --> 01:01:50,331
- Did she like it?
- How should I know?

862
01:01:50,457 --> 01:01:54,168
- Did you like it, asshole?
- No, man.

863
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,962
I felt like shit, I swear!

864
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,799
I wanted to tell you.

865
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,926
Go to hell, fucker!

866
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:03,636
You fucked our friendship!

867
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,179
You fucked my trust!

868
01:02:05,305 --> 01:02:08,557
You fucked my girl, asshole!
You fucked me!

869
01:02:09,476 --> 01:02:13,729
What a sap I was, bringing you
fuckin' comics from Lake Tahoe,

870
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:17,400
and a dress
for that fuckin' slut!

871
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:20,069
That's really fucked up.

872
01:02:25,325 --> 01:02:26,992
Tenoch...

873
01:02:27,661 --> 01:02:29,370
I'm sorry, man.

874
01:02:30,831 --> 01:02:32,665
It was an accident.

875
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:34,875
An accident?

876
01:02:35,627 --> 01:02:38,504
You poke a girl in the eye
by accident!

877
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,798
You don't fuck her by accident!

878
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,967
You don't fuck her!

879
01:02:44,678 --> 01:02:47,012
It went on like that all night.

880
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:51,767
Tenoch sought out
every possible detail

881
01:02:51,977 --> 01:02:56,480
as he tried to put together a puzzle
from pieces that didn't always fit...

882
01:02:57,691 --> 01:03:02,528
while Julio twisted those details
to create a less painful truth.

883
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,884
Doña Martina gave Luisa
the figure of the mouse

884
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:26,552
with her name on it.

885
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:30,139
She told her it had belonged
to her granddaughter, Luisa Obregón,

886
01:03:30,265 --> 01:03:34,727
who'd died of a heat stroke crossing
the Arizona border with her parents

887
01:03:34,853 --> 01:03:37,146
in search of a better life.

888
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:42,818
Luisa felt that even after people die,
they're still present.

889
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:48,949
She wondered how long she would
live on in the memory of others.

890
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:54,413
But she preferred not to fill her mind
with thoughts of death.

891
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:09,887
Julio, looks like the heat
got you a little excited too.

892
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,515
Yeah.

893
01:04:18,063 --> 01:04:19,939
The heat...

894
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,444
Hey ‒ what are you ‒
where are you going?

895
01:04:25,904 --> 01:04:28,656
This is your seat.
- How about introducing me?

896
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:31,659
You shouldn't do that, Luisa.

897
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:36,372
Tenoch, the same thing would have
happened if Julio had come to my room.

898
01:04:37,165 --> 01:04:40,543
What a sap I am!
You think I'm your chauffeur?

899
01:04:40,669 --> 01:04:43,087
Go fuck yourselves!

900
01:04:47,384 --> 01:04:49,009
Take it easy!

901
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:50,553
Fucking pigs!

902
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:53,889
Relax.

903
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,981
Let me.

904
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:31,010
- My sneakers.
- What?

905
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,511
Take them off.

906
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,054
Careful.

907
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:39,560
My panties.

908
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,365
Give it to me, Julio.

909
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,872
Feel me. Go slow.

910
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,790
Look at me.

911
01:06:14,721 --> 01:06:16,472
Wait.

912
01:06:21,019 --> 01:06:23,729
I'm sorry.

913
01:06:23,855 --> 01:06:25,773
It's all right.

914
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,380
Don't sulk like this.

915
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:55,969
Isn't that what you two wanted
from the start?

916
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,263
Wasn't that your plan?

917
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:01,225
To take me away on a trip
and fuck me?

918
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,018
Wasn't that it?

919
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:04,853
Well, then?

920
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,274
I'm such an idiot.

921
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,277
You know
what I should've done?

922
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:16,073
Not slept with either of you.

923
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:19,868
I never meant to hurt anybody.

924
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:22,287
You believe me?

925
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:26,291
Forgive me, okay?
- Yes.

926
01:07:26,501 --> 01:07:27,960
Let's go.

927
01:07:42,809 --> 01:07:45,310
- Me too.
- You too what?

928
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:49,064
Me too, faggot.

929
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:50,733
You too what?

930
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:53,819
I fucked your girlfriend, Ceci.

931
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,530
You did not.

932
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,912
When?
- After the Plastilina Mosh concert.

933
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:05,581
Motherfucker!

934
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:09,376
That's why
you dropped me off first?

935
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:16,550
Where?
- At my house.

936
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,512
- Your house?
- In my room.

937
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:23,849
She had flowered panties on.
- You slept with his girlfriend?

938
01:08:23,975 --> 01:08:26,018
That asshole fucked mine!

939
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:27,853
What about number three?

940
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:30,606
Your manifesto, not to screw
each other's girlfriend.

941
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:33,525
That's number five!

942
01:08:34,194 --> 01:08:35,694
Get out!

943
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:40,365
Out of the car, fucker!
We're gonna have this out!

944
01:08:40,492 --> 01:08:43,160
Open up, faggot!
- Cool it, guys!

945
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:48,040
That's classic!
Low-class trash!

946
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,001
This low-class trash
is gonna rip your head off!

947
01:08:51,211 --> 01:08:53,378
Blow me, man.

948
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,423
- Fuckin' yuppie!
- Go to hell!

949
01:08:57,592 --> 01:08:59,635
Stay out of this!

950
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:03,972
You can go fuck yourselves!
I'm such an idiot!

951
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:06,350
I thought you'd be different,
but you're animals!

952
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,560
Your manifesto
is a bunch of bullshit!

953
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:11,146
You break your own rules!

954
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:14,566
Typical men! Fighting like dogs
and marking your territory

955
01:09:14,734 --> 01:09:17,736
when all you really want
is to fuck each other!

956
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:24,368
Who cares who you fucked
when you both come in 10 seconds!

957
01:09:24,828 --> 01:09:26,912
What the hell was I thinking?

958
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:30,249
Play with babies
and you end up washing diapers!

959
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,425
You see, man?

960
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,637
Get out here!

961
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:47,057
She's leaving.
- You're the one who pushed her!

962
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:49,768
How could you fuck my Ceci?

963
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:52,062
That fucking slut!

964
01:09:52,313 --> 01:09:54,606
Now we're even.

965
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,025
Even, my ass!

966
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,653
Kneel down
and beg forgiveness

967
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,072
like you made me do
last night!

968
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,284
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- On your knees, asshole!

969
01:10:05,410 --> 01:10:07,870
Let it go, man.
She's gonna catch a ride.

970
01:10:07,996 --> 01:10:10,581
I know. So hurry up!

971
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,084
Move back.

972
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:17,087
If you want me to get out,
move back.

973
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,923
Further back!
- I'm not gonna touch you.

974
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,808
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- On both knees.

975
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,852
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry for what?

976
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:34,688
I'm sorry for fucking
your girlfriend, okay?

977
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:38,442
- Okay what?
- Come on. She's getting away.

978
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,656
- How many times?
- Once. What do you think I am?

979
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,286
Let's get this straight.
We'll go to the beach,

980
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:51,663
but your friendship
means shit to me!

981
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:54,791
- Same here, man.
- Fuck you!

982
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:59,171
Luisa, that's enough now.
Get in.

983
01:10:59,297 --> 01:11:02,424
Kiss my ass! I'm catching a bus
to Puerto Escondido.

984
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:04,760
To hell with you
and your Heaven's Mouth.

985
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:06,511
You gotta come with us.

986
01:11:06,638 --> 01:11:09,014
So you can fight like dogs?
No, thanks.

987
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,850
- We promise we won't fight.
- We swear!

988
01:11:11,976 --> 01:11:15,687
I don't want to be on a deserted beach
with a pair of assholes.

989
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:18,899
- We admit we fucked up.
- We'll do whatever you want.

990
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,902
- You call the shots.
- We're almost there!

991
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:25,781
We're really close!
Come on, get in.

992
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:29,743
If I come,
we do things my way.

993
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:32,371
One more fight
and I'm gone for good.

994
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:33,705
Anything you say.

995
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:37,000
I'm laying down my own rules.

996
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:41,755
I'll make my own manifesto!
You crossed the line, Julio.

997
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,635
One:
I'm not fucking either of you.

998
01:11:46,761 --> 01:11:49,388
You can fuck each other
if you want.

999
01:11:49,681 --> 01:11:51,974
Two:
I'm going to sunbathe nude,

1000
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,851
and I don't want you
sniffing around like dogs.

1001
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:57,020
Three: I pick the music.

1002
01:11:57,271 --> 01:12:01,274
Four: The moment I ask,
kindly shut your traps.

1003
01:12:02,110 --> 01:12:04,236
Five: You two cook.

1004
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:06,989
Six: Not another word

1005
01:12:07,115 --> 01:12:09,616
about your poor girlfriends.

1006
01:12:09,951 --> 01:12:12,119
Seven: If I ask...

1007
01:12:12,245 --> 01:12:15,914
you're to stay 10 yards away.
Or 100, if I prefer.

1008
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:20,168
Eight: Obviously,
you do all the manual labor.

1009
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:25,173
Nine: No discussing things
you don't agree on.

1010
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:28,593
Better yet,
just keep your mouths shut.

1011
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:31,763
And ten:
You're not allowed

1012
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,515
to contradict me,

1013
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:35,726
much less push me!

1014
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,736
Julio and Tenoch clearly had
no idea where they were

1015
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:49,114
or how to get somewhere
they'd never been.

1016
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:52,117
Saba's directions

1017
01:12:52,243 --> 01:12:54,161
contradicted each other.

1018
01:12:54,287 --> 01:12:59,666
Fearing that Luisa would catch on,
Julio turned right onto a dirt road.

1019
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,657
Julio and Tenoch
thought Luisa was asleep.

1020
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:16,868
They didn't know
that fear kept her awake,

1021
01:14:17,203 --> 01:14:20,372
a fear that had nothing to do
with the darkness

1022
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:22,541
or the surroundings.

1023
01:16:31,337 --> 01:16:33,380
Fried fish!

1024
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,924
Ceviche! Beer!

1025
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:52,107
Jesús Carranza, better known
as Chuy, and his wife Mabel

1026
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:55,694
were the fourth generation
of a family of fishermen.

1027
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:59,656
They lived nearby
in the village of San Bernabé.

1028
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:04,786
Chuy offered to give them a tour
of neighboring beaches the next day.

1029
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:08,331
He would charge them
350 pesos,

1030
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:10,292
including food.

1031
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:31,146
- Chuy, let me steer.
- No.

1032
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:34,399
- I know what I'm doing, man.
- Okay.

1033
01:17:34,567 --> 01:17:36,818
Just don't go too fast.

1034
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:40,655
Hey! Great swimming beach.

1035
01:17:40,781 --> 01:17:43,533
- What's it called?
- Heaven's Mouth.

1036
01:17:48,706 --> 01:17:49,956
All right!

1037
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:08,183
Lucero, leave the lady alone!

1038
01:18:08,309 --> 01:18:11,644
It's okay.
She's teaching me how to swim.

1039
01:18:12,980 --> 01:18:16,733
- Let me help you.
- It's okay. I got it.

1040
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:19,277
Go swim with your buddy.
He's all alone.

1041
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,571
The water's nice and warm.

1042
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:30,538
Let's see you float like a corpse.

1043
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:36,294
She's really dead!
Look at Lucero!

1044
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,719
He's a crybaby.

1045
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:47,639
He whines all night
and wakes up Mommy.

1046
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,725
He only stops crying
when I hold him.

1047
01:18:50,935 --> 01:18:55,772
He just likes being
with his pretty sister.

1048
01:18:56,107 --> 01:19:00,151
She looks just like you, Mabel.
The exact same eyes.

1049
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:04,739
You should have children, ma'am.
You're so good with them.

1050
01:19:05,408 --> 01:19:07,742
And you're just the right age.

1051
01:19:12,373 --> 01:19:15,333
He fell asleep.
What do I do?

1052
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:20,004
Ramón passes,
Zepeda charges down the sideline,

1053
01:19:20,131 --> 01:19:24,008
and the stadium goes wild!

1054
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:28,972
The Emperor steals it.
What a player!

1055
01:19:31,642 --> 01:19:35,854
Still waiting for the guest of honor ‒
the goal.

1056
01:19:38,065 --> 01:19:40,525
Shoot, damn it!

1057
01:19:42,528 --> 01:19:44,696
It's a pass to Cuauhtémoc.

1058
01:19:44,822 --> 01:19:47,574
He approaches the goal.

1059
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,242
He shoots!

1060
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,872
What a save!

1061
01:19:54,582 --> 01:19:57,000
Campos!

1062
01:19:59,837 --> 01:20:05,008
That's why
he's on the national team!

1063
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,678
What?

1064
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,055
Don't you like Campos?

1065
01:20:25,196 --> 01:20:28,364
You ever wish
you could live forever?

1066
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:30,283
Sure.

1067
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,202
Totally.

1068
01:20:33,913 --> 01:20:35,580
Wouldn't it be great?

1069
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:47,425
At the end of the year, Chuy and family
will have to leave their home

1070
01:20:47,551 --> 01:20:50,428
to make way for the construction
of an exclusive hotel

1071
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,847
on the communal land
of San Bernabé.

1072
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:56,226
They'll relocate to the outskirts
of Santa María Colotepec.

1073
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,896
Chuy will attempt
to give boat tours,

1074
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:04,609
but a collective of Acapulco boatmen
supported by the local tourism board

1075
01:21:04,735 --> 01:21:07,195
will block his plans.

1076
01:21:08,155 --> 01:21:12,033
Two years later,
he'll end up as a janitor at the hotel.

1077
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:14,410
He'll never fish again.

1078
01:21:19,041 --> 01:21:21,167
Holy shit.

1079
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:24,837
What the fuck!

1080
01:21:25,589 --> 01:21:28,299
Chuy, step on it!

1081
01:21:28,634 --> 01:21:31,219
Get the fuck outta here!

1082
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:35,139
It's shitting in the tent!

1083
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:38,810
Not that way! This way!

1084
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,771
It's shitting in there!

1085
01:21:47,027 --> 01:21:49,487
Get out, fucker!

1086
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,489
You're throwing shit at me!

1087
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:03,084
Get outta here!

1088
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:07,839
The pigs rendered
the campground uninhabitable.

1089
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:12,427
Julio and Tenoch decided
to spend the night in San Bernabé,

1090
01:22:12,553 --> 01:22:17,932
where Chuy had offered them a room
with electricity and water for 75 pesos.

1091
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:22,353
Luisa looked forward to a shower,
even if it was a cold one.

1092
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:26,232
They would come back
the next day to strike the camp.

1093
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:31,487
The 23 pigs had escaped
from a nearby ranch.

1094
01:22:31,614 --> 01:22:35,283
Over the next two months,
14 would be slaughtered.

1095
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:38,703
Three of those would cause
an outbreak of trichinosis

1096
01:22:38,871 --> 01:22:43,625
among attendees at a festival
in the village of El Chavarín.

1097
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:53,009
Stop spinning 'em, man.

1098
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:56,846
Jano, tell your mother
whatever you want.

1099
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:01,392
Let me talk or I'll hang up,
all right?

1100
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,311
Thank you.

1101
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,605
I was going to leave anyway.

1102
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:09,651
Your call just made it easier,
and I thank you for that.

1103
01:23:09,777 --> 01:23:12,403
This isn't about revenge.

1104
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:15,365
I always knew
about your affairs.

1105
01:23:15,491 --> 01:23:18,910
Carmen at El Escorial,
and that girl from Barcelona.

1106
01:23:19,036 --> 01:23:21,621
I knew all about them.

1107
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,583
I just hoped you'd change,
that's all.

1108
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:29,921
My decision has nothing
to do with that, believe me.

1109
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:33,841
I can't explain it now,
but you'll understand soon.

1110
01:23:34,259 --> 01:23:37,261
No, don't blame yourself,
or me.

1111
01:23:37,429 --> 01:23:42,308
You may not believe it,
but no one's to blame.

1112
01:23:43,894 --> 01:23:46,521
Of course I don't hate you!

1113
01:23:46,647 --> 01:23:49,107
And please don't hate me.

1114
01:23:50,609 --> 01:23:53,194
Jano, listen to me!

1115
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:57,907
I called to tell you that I love you,
and that you were my whole life.

1116
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,743
I don't expect this
to be a happy farewell,

1117
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:03,579
but let's make it
a tender one at least.

1118
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:08,626
Jano, calm down.
Don't be like that.

1119
01:24:12,506 --> 01:24:14,048
Listen...

1120
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:17,844
did you notice I took much less
than my share of the money?

1121
01:24:17,970 --> 01:24:20,930
No, I have plenty.

1122
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,684
I left my keys in the kitchen,
with the spare set.

1123
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:28,771
Don't lose the key to the roof.
It's the only one.

1124
01:24:29,815 --> 01:24:32,525
I took your T-shirts from Ibiza.

1125
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:35,361
You know
I love to sleep in them.

1126
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:39,991
Anyway, I just hope
you learn to be happy.

1127
01:24:40,242 --> 01:24:42,076
I am now.

1128
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:46,330
Take care of yourself.
I'm hanging up now. Bye.

1129
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:12,899
I really am indebted
to all of Jano's mistresses.

1130
01:25:13,025 --> 01:25:15,193
You know how I knew?

1131
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:19,489
He'd try things on me in bed
that he'd learned from them.

1132
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,741
You can tell these things.

1133
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,702
- Like the finger up the ass?
- Exactly.

1134
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:28,331
But you have to do it delicately,
with finesse.

1135
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:31,876
You don't just jam it up there.

1136
01:25:32,669 --> 01:25:35,171
Jano was
a master of finesse.

1137
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:38,382
- To the master of finesse!
- To Jano!

1138
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,885
To Jano,
wherever he may be.

1139
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:44,889
You know, I'm really glad
I met you guys.

1140
01:25:45,057 --> 01:25:48,059
I mean it. Sometimes
you're complete assholes,

1141
01:25:48,227 --> 01:25:51,521
but basically
you're pretty cool dudes.

1142
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,356
Fuckin' right!

1143
01:25:53,482 --> 01:25:57,360
And you're so lucky
to live in a country like this.

1144
01:25:57,486 --> 01:26:01,531
It breathes with life!
It's awesome!

1145
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:06,202
To Mexico!
- To magical, musical Mexico!

1146
01:26:06,328 --> 01:26:08,913
Hey, are you friends again?

1147
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:10,581
No way!

1148
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:13,084
Come on. Make up.

1149
01:26:13,335 --> 01:26:15,419
So I'm low-class trash,
asshole?

1150
01:26:15,546 --> 01:26:18,756
Totally! That loogie
you hocked at the window!

1151
01:26:18,882 --> 01:26:21,133
Fuck you. It's my car.

1152
01:26:21,260 --> 01:26:24,554
- And I'm a yuppie?
- Okay, a preppie.

1153
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:27,598
But you love visiting my houses,
you social climber!

1154
01:26:27,766 --> 01:26:31,310
Only to get a taste
of what your old man steals!

1155
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:33,938
Isn't your dad an honest man?

1156
01:26:34,106 --> 01:26:36,774
Yeah, right!

1157
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,906
You idiots!
You're friends again now.

1158
01:26:44,032 --> 01:26:47,034
To the Charolastras!

1159
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:49,537
- Beer, anyone?
- Yeah, but ice-cold.

1160
01:26:49,663 --> 01:26:51,497
Of course!

1161
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:55,751
- Luisa...
- What?

1162
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,421
I'm sorry I pushed you.

1163
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:00,965
Julio, you crossed the line!

1164
01:27:01,133 --> 01:27:03,885
- I know.
- Give me a kiss.

1165
01:27:05,304 --> 01:27:06,929
Forgiven.

1166
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,725
Luisa,
the absolute truth now:

1167
01:27:10,851 --> 01:27:13,811
Which of us fucks better?

1168
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:16,522
You make me laugh.

1169
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:23,029
You're both disasters,
but each has his charms.

1170
01:27:23,155 --> 01:27:25,489
But who made you feel better?

1171
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:28,659
Here's how Julio comes:

1172
01:27:28,827 --> 01:27:31,162
¡Mamacita, mamacita!

1173
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:37,168
And Julio,
you cross your eyes.

1174
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,757
You both have to quit whacking off
and work up your endurance.

1175
01:27:42,883 --> 01:27:46,385
- I bet he came quicker than me!
- No more whacking off.

1176
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:49,347
No way! What about number seven
in our manifesto?

1177
01:27:49,473 --> 01:27:51,182
Take it out.

1178
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:55,603
Chuy, nothing like
tooting the old horn, eh?

1179
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,855
To spanking the monkey!

1180
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:01,150
No, not until you learn
how to fuck properly.

1181
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:03,527
While we're on the subject...

1182
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:07,531
these boys don't know
how to go down on a girl.

1183
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:09,659
I never got the chance!

1184
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:12,161
I'm sure
you're as clueless as he is.

1185
01:28:13,163 --> 01:28:16,791
You were slurping
like it was some kind of lollipop.

1186
01:28:16,917 --> 01:28:19,126
You have to be very gentle.

1187
01:28:19,252 --> 01:28:21,837
You have to make the clitoris
your best friend.

1188
01:28:21,964 --> 01:28:24,674
What kind of friend
is always hiding?

1189
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:26,717
He who seeks shall find.

1190
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:29,261
The greatest pleasure
is giving pleasure.

1191
01:28:29,388 --> 01:28:32,264
Absolutely. Hail the clit!

1192
01:28:34,518 --> 01:28:37,228
To the clitoris!

1193
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:43,401
The god's-honest truth now.
I mean it.

1194
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:47,488
Swear you'll tell me the truth.
- I swear.

1195
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,448
Did Ceci blow you?

1196
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,993
The god's-honest truth?

1197
01:28:52,202 --> 01:28:54,662
She bites a little, huh?

1198
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:56,872
She did blow you!

1199
01:28:56,999 --> 01:29:00,710
- Does Ana bite too?
- No, she gives great head.

1200
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:05,047
- You said she didn't blow you!
- Just the tip, man.

1201
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,550
She missed the main course.

1202
01:29:10,137 --> 01:29:13,264
Chuy, don't blow jobs rule?

1203
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,892
To blow jobs!

1204
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:20,187
Since we're spilling
our guts here...

1205
01:29:20,772 --> 01:29:24,650
I actually fucked Ceci
a couple times.

1206
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:32,074
No big deal.
I poked Ana a bunch of times.

1207
01:29:32,284 --> 01:29:36,620
- Yuck! I've been stirring your cream!
- Same here!

1208
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:41,917
That makes us
cum brothers, man!

1209
01:29:42,461 --> 01:29:45,838
Those poor girls!
I feel so sorry for them.

1210
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:53,471
Chuy, this asshole fucked my chick,
but he comes lickety-split.

1211
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:57,892
To your girlfriends, who are probably
fucking 10 Italians at a time!

1212
01:29:58,018 --> 01:29:59,602
You're on!

1213
01:29:59,728 --> 01:30:02,104
- To Luigi!
- To Tiberio!

1214
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,649
- You got any change?
- Who wants the worm?

1215
01:30:05,776 --> 01:30:07,860
I'll take it.

1216
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,654
Listen, Tenoch...

1217
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:12,865
and your mom too.

1218
01:30:12,991 --> 01:30:14,492
Are you shitting me?

1219
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:17,328
For real.
The day she cleaned my aura.

1220
01:30:19,331 --> 01:30:21,373
Are you serious?

1221
01:30:21,500 --> 01:30:23,542
Totally!

1222
01:30:26,171 --> 01:30:28,631
A toast to forgiveness, dude.

1223
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:32,593
Luisa, to mothers!

1224
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:40,518
Who sings "La Sandunga"?

1225
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:43,687
Camilo Sesto!

1226
01:30:43,855 --> 01:30:47,191
Never mind.
Give me a number and a letter.

1227
01:30:47,901 --> 01:30:49,527
Number 13.

1228
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,446
- The letter B.
- B-13.

1229
01:34:23,241 --> 01:34:26,702
Past Heaven's Mouth
you'll find Palicata Bay

1230
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:29,621
and the beaches
of Chacrita and Santa Rita.

1231
01:34:29,748 --> 01:34:31,749
And Chacagua.

1232
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,793
Beautiful names.
Do they mean anything?

1233
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:36,628
Who knows?

1234
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:06,075
Morning, sleepyhead.

1235
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,660
Want some eggs?

1236
01:35:10,622 --> 01:35:14,249
- A little shrimp soup?
- Please, and a beer.

1237
01:35:14,376 --> 01:35:16,418
A little hair of the dog.

1238
01:35:16,878 --> 01:35:19,630
I gotta get going.
I promised my sister the car.

1239
01:35:19,798 --> 01:35:21,006
That's fine.

1240
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:23,675
What's that beach again?
- Chacagua.

1241
01:35:23,802 --> 01:35:26,136
Is there anything
beyond Chacagua?

1242
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:30,140
Amaranto,
and Playa de Oro beach.

1243
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:34,311
It's open sea, with huge waves.
Lots of people drown there.

1244
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,106
But the sunsets are beautiful.

1245
01:35:37,232 --> 01:35:41,568
- Another shrimp soup, Mabel.
- No, thanks.

1246
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:45,322
I better get going.
My folks will start to worry.

1247
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,742
Julio has to get the car back
to his sister too.

1248
01:35:48,868 --> 01:35:52,371
I'm going to stay
a few more days.

1249
01:35:52,497 --> 01:35:55,707
They're going to show me
some beautiful beaches.

1250
01:35:55,834 --> 01:35:58,752
- I'm hungry, Mom.
- Here.

1251
01:36:25,905 --> 01:36:30,534
At 1:00 p.m., Julio and Tenoch
began their trip back home.

1252
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,246
It was a very quiet
and uneventful trip.

1253
01:36:35,081 --> 01:36:39,084
Their families never found out
about the trip to the beach

1254
01:36:39,210 --> 01:36:40,878
with Luisa.

1255
01:36:41,045 --> 01:36:43,046
She stayed behind

1256
01:36:43,214 --> 01:36:46,717
to begin her exploration
of the local coves the next day.

1257
01:36:48,720 --> 01:36:52,139
When they said good-bye,
she told Tenoch and Julio,

1258
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:57,436
"Life is like the foam,
so give yourself away like the sea."

1259
01:37:14,245 --> 01:37:16,121
After returning from Europe,

1260
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:19,500
Ana and Cecilia broke up
with Tenoch and Julio.

1261
01:37:19,876 --> 01:37:23,670
Two months later,
Tenoch started dating his neighbor.

1262
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:28,717
It was nine months before Julio started
dating a girl from his French class.

1263
01:37:29,636 --> 01:37:32,554
Julio and Tenoch
stopped seeing each other.

1264
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:37,935
The following summer, the ruling party
lost the presidential election

1265
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:40,312
for the first time in 71 years.

1266
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:43,732
Julio ran into Tenoch
on the way to the dentist.

1267
01:37:43,858 --> 01:37:46,276
Going for a cup of coffee
was less awkward

1268
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:48,445
than making excuses to avoid it.

1269
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,198
Have you seen Saba?

1270
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:53,784
No, but he's living
in Real de Catorce.

1271
01:37:54,118 --> 01:37:56,286
Cool. Good for him.

1272
01:37:57,121 --> 01:38:01,375
- And Daniel?
- Total queen at this point.

1273
01:38:02,544 --> 01:38:04,628
His dad kicked him out.

1274
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:08,632
Shit. That sucks.

1275
01:38:08,758 --> 01:38:13,262
No, he's super happy, man.
Got a boyfriend and everything.

1276
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:15,931
Then... that's cool.

1277
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:21,186
I got into the university.
- Cool. When do you start?

1278
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:24,314
- September.
- Economics?

1279
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:27,276
Yeah. And you?

1280
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,654
Biology.
I start next week.

1281
01:38:30,989 --> 01:38:34,950
- That sucks.
- Public universities start earlier.

1282
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,127
Did you hear about Luisa?

1283
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:50,882
What?

1284
01:38:51,843 --> 01:38:54,553
- She died.
- No way.

1285
01:38:54,679 --> 01:38:57,139
- Anything else, guys?
- No, thanks.

1286
01:39:00,184 --> 01:39:02,811
- How?
- Cancer.

1287
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,355
She had it all over.

1288
01:39:06,608 --> 01:39:10,777
Right there in San Bernabé,
a month after we left.

1289
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:14,197
Chuy called Jano,
and that was that.

1290
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:17,075
Shit. That's terrible.

1291
01:39:17,201 --> 01:39:20,329
She knew all along
she was going to die.

1292
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,874
She didn't want anyone to know.

1293
01:39:31,049 --> 01:39:35,719
Luisa spent her last four days
in the hospital in Santa María Colotepec.

1294
01:39:36,512 --> 01:39:38,180
At her request,

1295
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:42,309
Chuy and Mabel never mentioned
her adventure with Tenoch and Julio.

1296
01:39:42,685 --> 01:39:44,519
Before she died,

1297
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:48,315
she gave Lucero
the little stuffed mouse named Luisa.

1298
01:39:51,110 --> 01:39:53,028
Tenoch excused himself.

1299
01:39:53,154 --> 01:39:55,739
His girlfriend was waiting
to go to the movies.

1300
01:39:55,865 --> 01:39:58,241
Julio insisted
on paying the check.

1301
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,036
They will never meet again.

1302
01:40:01,162 --> 01:40:03,914
- See you around?
- Sure.

1303
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,055
Check, please.
