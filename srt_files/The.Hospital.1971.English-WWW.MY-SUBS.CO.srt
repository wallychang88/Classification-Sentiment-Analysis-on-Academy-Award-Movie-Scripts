1
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:36,287
On Monday morning,

2
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:38,873
a patient named Guernsey,
male, middle 70s,

3
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:41,876
was admitted to the hospital
complaining of chest pains.

4
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:44,670
He had been referred
by a nursing home

5
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:48,799
where the doctor had diagnosed
his condition as Angina Pectoris.

6
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,802
Now, it is axiomatic

7
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,722
that nursing-home doctors
are always wrong.

8
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,017
The intern who admitted
Mr. Guernsey,

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,103
however, accepted the diagnosis
and prescribed morphine,

10
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,022
a drug suitable for angina,

11
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,274
but not at all suitable
for emphysema,

12
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,694
which is unfortunately
what the old man actually had.

13
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:11,906
Within an hour, the patient became
unresponsive and diaphoretic,

14
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:13,824
and was raced up
to intensive care,

15
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,659
with an irregular pulse
of 150,

16
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:19,330
blood pressure 90 over 60,
respiration rapid and shallow.

17
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:22,041
The resident on
duty in intensive care

18
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,335
now compounded the blunder
by treating the old man

19
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,878
for pulmonary edema.

20
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:28,839
He gave him digitalis,
diuretics and oxygen.

21
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,342
This restored
the old man's color,

22
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,844
and he was sent to his room
in the Holly Pavilion,

23
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,555
ruddy-complected
and peacefully asleep.

24
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,690
In point of fact,
the patient was in

25
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,652
C.O.2 narcosis and died
at 7:30 that evening.

26
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:51,904
I mention all
this only to explain

27
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:54,740
how the bed in room
806 became a vailable.

28
00:01:57,535 --> 00:01:59,161
The intern involved

29
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:01,497
was a prickly young buck
named Schaefer,

30
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,332
who had a good thing
going for him

31
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:06,127
with a technician in
the hematology lab.

32
00:02:06,293 --> 00:02:09,088
In the haphazard fashion
of hospital romances,

33
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,465
Dr. Schaefer had been
zapping this girl

34
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:14,552
on wheelchairs, stretchers,
pantry shelves,

35
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,637
in the kitchen,
in the morgue,

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,472
in the dark corners
of corridors,

37
00:02:18,556 --> 00:02:20,558
standing up,
sitting down...

38
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:22,309
So you can imagine

39
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:25,187
what an a vailable bed
meant to him.

40
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:29,316
Hey, Sheila,
this is Howard, Sheila.

41
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,443
Hey, listen, I got a bed
for us, for tonight.

42
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,612
A real, honest-to-god bed.

43
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,993
Dr. Schaefer.

44
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:19,718
Dr. Schaefer.

45
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,999
Listen, did you know that Dr. Schaefer
was in room 806

46
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:51,208
because he's dead?

47
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,334
What?

48
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,421
I'm just telling you that
Dr. Schaefer is dead.

49
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,051
What do you want,
Perez?

50
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,803
I don't know what the hell
this is about,

51
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,388
but Dr. Schaefer
is in room 806

52
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,015
with an I.V. Running,
and he's dead.

53
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,850
I didn't even
know he was sick.

54
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:10,269
Perez, what the hell
are you talking about?

55
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,979
Do you know what
she's talking about?

56
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,105
No.

57
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,316
Maybe I'm going crazy.
I don't know.

58
00:05:15,441 --> 00:05:17,735
Isn't room 806
the patient Guernsey?

59
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:20,321
Did something happen that
maybe I didn't know about?

60
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:22,781
Perez, I don't know what
you're talking about.

61
00:05:22,865 --> 00:05:24,742
This is the nuttiest thing
I ever saw.

62
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,660
Dr. Schaefer is
in room 806, dead.

63
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:28,787
What Dr. Schaefer?
Our Dr. Schaefer?

64
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:29,872
Our Dr. Schaefer.

65
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,957
The one who's always
grabbing everybody's ass.

66
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:33,542
Do you know what
she's talking about?

67
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,626
No.

68
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,628
I don't know what
you're talking about.

69
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,089
What do you mean,
"Dr. Schaefer's in room 806, dead"?

70
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,133
I mean that he's lying
on the far bed,

71
00:05:41,216 --> 00:05:42,968
stone dead
and with an I.V.

72
00:05:43,052 --> 00:05:44,178
If you don't believe me,

73
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:47,723
maybe you ought to just get up
and go look for yourself.

74
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,615
All right,
maybe you'd better call Mrs. Christie.

75
00:06:37,606 --> 00:06:38,857
Dr. Bock.

76
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,320
Yes, Mrs. Christie,
what is it?

77
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,533
No, no, it's all right.

78
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:49,952
I'd have to be getting up
any minute, anyway.

79
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:54,164
Miss, uh,

80
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,291
sorry, I missed that, uh.

81
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,669
Would you say
it again, please?

82
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,214
Yes, I know.

83
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,675
Yes, uh...

84
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,804
Uh, Schaefer,
the stud with the glasses,

85
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,222
fancies all the nurses.

86
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,061
I'm afraid
I don't understand.

87
00:07:16,145 --> 00:07:17,855
What do you...
what do you mean?

88
00:07:22,234 --> 00:07:23,652
Was he sick?

89
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,115
I mean, was...

90
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:35,998
Uh, w-what...what was
the cause of death?

91
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,753
Uh, well, was he
being treated?

92
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,089
I mean,
I don't understand, uh...

93
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,341
Uh...

94
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,552
What was he doing in the bed?

95
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,512
I mean, you did say...

96
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,351
Uh, well,
Mrs. Christie, uh,

97
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,021
did you call the office?

98
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:02,232
Good, I'll...I'll...

99
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,861
No, no, no, no, it's all right.
I, uh...

100
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:10,407
I'd be getting my wake-up call
any minute, anyway.

101
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,245
People!

102
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,086
Hey, man, there he goes.

103
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,171
Let's go
and get him!

104
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,255
Yeah!

105
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:28,675
Hey!

106
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:46,318
We're the hope.

107
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,903
What do you say,
Sundstrom?

108
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,280
Just how much longer do you
think your monopolistic,

109
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,699
exclusionary,
racist policies will work?

110
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:57,788
We're the hope!

111
00:08:58,497 --> 00:08:59,957
Now, hold it.

112
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:02,960
Herb!

113
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,504
I'm glad I caught up
with you.

114
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,881
How's it going?

115
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:10,050
One of my interns
dropped dead this morning.

116
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:12,010
Oh, really?
I'm sorry to hear that.

117
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,596
I understand
you moved out to a hotel.

118
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:15,722
Yes.

119
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,016
Things got that
bad with Phyllis?

120
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:20,227
It's been that bad
for 24 years.

121
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:21,812
You gonna be solicitous?

122
00:09:21,979 --> 00:09:22,980
Yeah.

123
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,064
Ooh, god.

124
00:09:24,231 --> 00:09:25,399
Herb, listen,
I'm the guy

125
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,025
that brought you
into this hospital

126
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,778
so I think I can skip
the diplomatic overtures.

127
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,738
Marty stopped me
in the hall yesterday,

128
00:09:31,822 --> 00:09:32,823
very upset.

129
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,116
He had just had
lunch with you,

130
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:35,993
said you sounded
suicidal.

131
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,495
Now, Marty tends
to be extravagant,

132
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,163
but he's not
the only one.

133
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:41,832
Jack singer mentioned,
the other day,

134
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,458
that you were
boozing it up a lot.

135
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:46,044
Let's face it,
you have been sloughing off.

136
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:48,463
I understand you haven't even
been doing rounds.

137
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,424
I'm going
to do rounds today.

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,847
Herb, do you want to take
a couple of days off?

139
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,973
No.

140
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,308
Go down to Montego Bay,

141
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:01,143
get drunk, get laid,
get a little sun?

142
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,145
For god's sake, John,
I'm 53 years old,

143
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,396
with all
the attendant fears.

144
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,189
I just left my wife,
after 24 years.

145
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,525
A standard case of
menopausal melancholy.

146
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,152
Maybe you wanna talk
to Joe Einhorn.

147
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:12,571
I don't wanna see a psychiatrist,
stop worrying about me.

148
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,406
All I gotta do is get back to work,
I'll be fine.

149
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,616
I'm sorry
if I caused you concern.

150
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:16,742
Yeah?

151
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,160
Sid just called
from St. Luke's.

152
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,661
He heard the demonstrators
up there

153
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,747
are planning a march
to join a bunch down here.

154
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,123
Oh, god.
Did you call the cops?

155
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:24,291
Sure.

156
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,263
They're all in 806,
doctor.

157
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:39,598
What happened?

158
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,018
I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie
tell you about it.

159
00:10:57,616 --> 00:10:58,659
Oh, boy.

160
00:10:58,742 --> 00:10:59,785
What happened?

161
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,537
I've seen some pretty good snafus.
But this one...

162
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,581
There's a certain
splendor to this one.

163
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,626
One of the night nurses, a per diem,
thought Schaefer was a patient

164
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:10,253
and plugged an I.V. Into him.
He was a diabetic, you know.

165
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:12,381
What do you mean
she plugged an I.V. Into him?

166
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,591
It's a really screwed-up
story. What happened was

167
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:16,968
we had an old man in that bed who died
last night.

168
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,387
So the bed was available.

169
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,597
You know Schaefer.
He's Sammy stud.

170
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:22,974
He talked a nurse
into zapping him on the bed?

171
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,560
A girl from hematology
he's been running around with.

172
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:26,895
God, it's a Roman farce!

173
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,022
I thought I heard you
out here, doctor.

174
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:31,650
Nancy!

175
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:33,527
I suggest you do
that right now.

176
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,904
Dr. Bock, I'm so
terribly sorry. I...

177
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,994
As I understand it,

178
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,205
one of the nurses inadvertently
administered an I.V.

179
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,290
To Schaefer. How the hell
could that happen?

180
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:49,334
We ought to straighten
this out somewhere else.

181
00:11:49,418 --> 00:11:51,211
Yes. Very good idea.

182
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,798
Oh, god, what a mess!

183
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,352
Well, these things happen,
of course.

184
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,521
I suppose, I'd better call
the medical examiner.

185
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:11,189
I still don't understand
what happened.

186
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,775
It took us about an hour
to get it sorted out.

187
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,360
It seems a patient
named Guernsey

188
00:12:15,444 --> 00:12:16,820
died last night,
in 806.

189
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,072
But that information wasn't given
to the night nurses.

190
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:21,074
Uh, these things
happen.

191
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,161
At any rate,
according to the cardex,

192
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:28,039
the patient, Guernsey, was down
for 25 m.g. of sparine at q. 6h.

193
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,626
And Mrs. Reardon sent nurse Perez
to give him his 12:00 shot.

194
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,961
In the meantime,
it seems

195
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:34,921
Dr. Schaefer usurped
that particular bed

196
00:12:35,005 --> 00:12:36,506
for his own purposes.

197
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,009
Dr. Brubaker suggests
it was for a love tryst

198
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,052
and some weight is
given that hypothesis

199
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:42,846
by the fact that
Dr. Schaefer was naked.

200
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:44,514
I got the drift,
Mrs. Christine.

201
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:46,099
In other words,
nurse Perez went in

202
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,517
and sedated Dr. Schaefer,

203
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:49,102
thinking it was
the patient, Guernsey.

204
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:50,562
My god! What I don't
understand...

205
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:52,063
may I finish,
please, doctor?

206
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:53,774
After Perez
gave him his shot,

207
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,318
she noticed the I.V. Was
pinched off on the bed.

208
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,029
So, she reported this
back to Mrs. Reardon

209
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,491
who then assigned nurse rivers
to restart the I.V.

210
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:03,909
Now, rivers was a float.

211
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:06,328
She didn't even know the staff people
on the floor.

212
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:08,747
Nobody knew what the patient Guernsey
looked like anyway,

213
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:10,999
since he'd only been
admitted that morning.

214
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:13,418
So she plugged
an I.V. Into him.

215
00:13:13,502 --> 00:13:14,753
Yes.

216
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:16,505
How much?

217
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:17,631
A liter.

218
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:22,010
5 percent glucose solution
won't kill anybody.

219
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:25,013
Wasn't dehydrated,
was he?

220
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,890
Did he have any other
ancillary conditions?

221
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:29,768
Didn't anybody bother to go check on him
during the night?

222
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,896
Even under the impression
that he was merely a patient?

223
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:35,065
Was he hyperosmolar?
Did he have a bad heart?

224
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:37,484
He must have had
some sort of thrombosis.

225
00:13:40,403 --> 00:13:43,031
I want the p-post done here,
Mr. Hitchcock.

226
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,659
You and I better have a little chat,
Mrs. Christie,

227
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,452
about your excessive
use of float nurses.

228
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:49,621
I've got nearly a 1000
nurses in this hospital...

229
00:13:49,704 --> 00:13:51,540
and every time one
of them has her period,

230
00:13:51,623 --> 00:13:53,458
she disappears
for 3 days.

231
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:54,709
My doctors
complain regularly

232
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,837
they can't find the same nurse
on the same floor

233
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,921
2 days in a row.

234
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,715
Now, what am I gonna tell
this boy, Schaefer's parents?

235
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,301
That a substitute
nurse assassinated him

236
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:04,928
because she couldn't
tell the doctors

237
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,429
from the patients
on the floor?

238
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,722
My god!

239
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:10,976
The incompetence here
is absolutely radiant!

240
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,439
2 separate nurses
walk into a room

241
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:17,524
and stick needles
in a man

242
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,317
and one of those is
a number 18 jelco,

243
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:20,986
tourniquet the poor
son of a bitch,

244
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,488
anchor the poor son of a bitch's arm
with adhesive tape,

245
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,199
and it's the wrong
poor son of a bitch!

246
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:27,909
My god! I mean,

247
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,287
where do you train
your nurses, Mrs. Christie?

248
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,580
Dachau?

249
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,335
All right.

250
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,631
Wrap him up and get him
down to pathology.

251
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:44,092
I'm especially interested
in his blood sugar.

252
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,011
A liter of glucose
never killed anybody.

253
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,930
Your ladies must have
done something else to him.

254
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:51,641
Will there be
anything else, doctor?

255
00:14:51,725 --> 00:14:52,767
No.

256
00:14:54,519 --> 00:14:56,104
Before you call
the family, doctor,

257
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:58,189
I wish you'd speak to
Mr. Mead about this.

258
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:00,734
We'd like, naturally,
to avoid litigation.

259
00:15:17,792 --> 00:15:19,461
A few things
have been piling up.

260
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,296
Would you like
to go into them?

261
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:28,845
A quickie.

262
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,390
Dr. Esterhazy wants to start hiring
temporary people

263
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,351
to cover
the summer vacations.

264
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:36,811
He says, last year,
some of the replacement people

265
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:39,606
didn't receive their checks
until they waited 6 months.

266
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,441
He wonders whether you
could do something

267
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,818
about getting these
people paid more promptly.

268
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:46,780
Ms. Aronovici complains

269
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,616
the lab reports are coming
in slow into the E.R.

270
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,785
I called Dr. Immelman
about that,

271
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:54,496
and she says 3 microscopes
have been stolen out of her lab

272
00:15:54,579 --> 00:15:56,247
in the last 2 months.

273
00:15:56,498 --> 00:15:59,501
Charlie Walters also
complains about pilferage.

274
00:15:59,834 --> 00:16:02,170
I've clumped all these
together for you.

275
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:05,131
Now, as you know,
doctor,

276
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:07,884
we've agreed to take over
the local ambulance cases

277
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,011
as part of
the hospital's commitment

278
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,513
to the community,

279
00:16:11,846 --> 00:16:14,683
and it's created
a serious overload in E.R.

280
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,394
I don't know why
this was dumped in our lap,

281
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:18,979
but they seem to think...

282
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,231
find out if Dr. Einhorn
is in his office.

283
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,483
Which Dr. Einhorn?

284
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,276
Ophthalmology
or psychiatry?

285
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,988
Psychiatry. Never mind.
I'll look in, myself.

286
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,590
Is he in?

287
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,675
Uh-huh.

288
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:50,802
Can I have a minute, Joe?

289
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:52,137
Of course.

290
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:59,978
I've been having periods
of acute depression, recently.

291
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,356
Apparently, it's becoming
noticeable.

292
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,900
A number of people
have remarked about it.

293
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,863
Anyway, uh, John Sundstrom
thought it might be a good idea

294
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,865
if I spoke to you
about it.

295
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,324
Do you want
to sit down, herb?

296
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:16,077
No. I'm not good
at confessional.

297
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:21,875
Well, what can I tell you?

298
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,212
The last year,
2, 3...

299
00:17:26,337 --> 00:17:27,589
it goes way back,
I suppose.

300
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,591
I can remember entertaining
suicidal thoughts

301
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,259
as a college student.

302
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,511
At any rate,

303
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:37,640
I've always found
life demanding.

304
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,229
I'm an only child of
a lower-middle-class people.

305
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:46,316
I was the glory
of my parents.

306
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:48,485
"My son, the doctor."
You know.

307
00:17:48,735 --> 00:17:50,195
I was always top
of my class.

308
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,281
Scholarship to Harvard.
The boy genius. The...

309
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,408
Brilliant eccentric.

310
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,037
Terrified of women,

311
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:01,956
clumsy at sports.

312
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:06,127
God, Joe, how do I
go about this?

313
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:09,339
I understand you just
separated from your wife.

314
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:11,674
I left her a dozen times.

315
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:13,802
She left me a dozen times.

316
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,721
We stayed together through a process
of attrition.

317
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:19,724
Obviously,
sadomasochistic dependency.

318
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:22,894
My home is hell.

319
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:25,230
We've got
a 23-year-old boy.

320
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,857
I threw him out of
the house last year.

321
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,985
A shaggy-haired Maoist.

322
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:33,488
I don't know where he is.

323
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,907
Presumably, building bombs
in basements

324
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,785
as an expression of his
universal brotherhood.

325
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,663
I've got
a 17-year-old daughter

326
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,832
who's had 2 abortions
in 2 years,

327
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,043
got arrested last week
at a rock festival,

328
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,586
for pushing drugs.

329
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,005
They let her go.

330
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,135
The typical
affluent American family.

331
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,765
I don't mean to be
facile about this.

332
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,478
I blame myself for
those 2 useless young people.

333
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,356
I never exercised
parental authority.

334
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,191
I'm no good at that.

335
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,862
Oh, god, I'm no good
at this, either, Joe.

336
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,363
Let's just forget
the whole thing.

337
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,198
I'm sorry I bothered you.

338
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:20,577
How serious are your
suicidal speculations, herb?

339
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:25,623
Well, I amuse myself with different ways
of killing myself

340
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,500
that don't look
like suicide.

341
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:29,919
I wouldn't want to do my family
out of the insurance.

342
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,839
Well, digitalis will give you
an arrhythmia.

343
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:36,050
A good toxologist
would find traces.

344
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:38,303
Potassium's much better.

345
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:40,763
60 milli-equivalent.
Instantaneous.

346
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,975
Of course, then you're stuck with how
to get rid of the hypodermic.

347
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,518
40 milli-equivalent.

348
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:47,979
Gives you time
to dispose of the evidence.

349
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,899
You seem to have given considerable
thought to the matter.

350
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:51,983
Hmm.

351
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,109
You ought to know

352
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:55,820
that a man who talks about it
all the time never does it.

353
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:57,238
I don't know.

354
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:59,199
I see a man exhausted,

355
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,075
emotionally drained,

356
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:03,244
riddled with guilt,

357
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,789
has been systematically
stripping himself of wife,

358
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:07,957
children, friends,

359
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,084
isolating himself
from the world.

360
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:12,754
Are you impotent?

361
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,797
Intermittently.

362
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:16,132
What does that mean?

363
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:19,260
Means I haven't tried
in so long, I don't know.

364
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,431
Let's just drop
the whole thing, Joe.

365
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,975
I feel humiliated
and stupid. I...

366
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:28,311
Just got to
pull myself together

367
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,021
and get back into my work.

368
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:31,356
I'm sorry I troubled you.

369
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,608
Take care of yourself.
I'll see you later.

370
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,197
10-4, save our homes.

371
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,074
2-4, we the poor.

372
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:43,076
Don't go 'round.
Don't tear us down.

373
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,036
10-4, save our homes.

374
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,955
2-4, we the poor.

375
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,831
Don't go 'round.
Don't tear us down.

376
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,792
10-4, save our homes.

377
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,710
2-4, we the poor.

378
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,962
Don't go 'round.
Don't tear...

379
00:21:47,348 --> 00:21:50,810
Dr. Taffy, Dr. Taffy, Dr. Lewis Taffy.

380
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,146
Dr. Rashid, Dr. Rashid.

381
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:54,772
- All set?
- Yes, sir.

382
00:22:02,613 --> 00:22:04,198
Who was that exotic group?

383
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,576
You got me. They've been here
about an hour.

384
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,370
I think they're with
the old man in, uh, 806, sir.

385
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:13,082
Dr. Perry said he picked the tuberculosis
and liver nodes for today, right?

386
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,167
Yes, sir.

387
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:15,960
Good, because that's
the one I studied up.

388
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,045
A hell of a case.

389
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,129
Yes, sir.

390
00:22:28,348 --> 00:22:29,515
All right,
who's presenting?

391
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,309
I am, sir. Should I start?

392
00:22:32,477 --> 00:22:33,895
Mr. Hemmings?

393
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,356
Mr. Hemmings!

394
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,152
Is there anybody seated who
hasn't been to see me first?

395
00:22:41,235 --> 00:22:43,029
Is there anybody here
who has not given me

396
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,614
their health-insurance
number?

397
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,870
Emergency room.

398
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:54,582
I don't know, Sybil.
What's his name?

399
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,042
Would you wait a moment,
please?

400
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,168
I'm on the phone.

401
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,212
Can't you see
I'm on the phone?

402
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,339
I am, Sybil.
I'm looking.

403
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:02,423
Just...

404
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:06,052
Of course not.
Do they ever?

405
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:11,057
Would you mind, please?
Excuse me.

406
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:12,683
32?

407
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,978
Telescope sights.
They follow me everywhere.

408
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:17,563
3 big black men.

409
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,066
Naked, completely exposed,
right in the street.

410
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,610
Hanging down to their knees.
It's disgusting.

411
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,239
Did you call upstairs
and tell them

412
00:23:26,322 --> 00:23:27,949
to admit a patient
named Mitgang?

413
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,450
Is that the
concussion?

414
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:30,576
I don't know.

415
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,245
They said you didn't
fill out the chart.

416
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:33,830
Where do you come
off sending anyone

417
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,581
up to admitting,
without my OK?

418
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,292
Sally, would you get
the hell out of here?

419
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,253
The patient's in
the holding room.

420
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:41,754
You want his
blue cross number,

421
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:43,923
you go in and you get
his blue cross number.

422
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,384
Dr. Speziol,

423
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:49,512
may I see you for a moment, doctor,
if you don't mind?

424
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,223
Doctor,
is this your handwriting,

425
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,016
if you don't mind?

426
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,436
Am I supposed
to read this?

427
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:59,981
Was that a sprain?
Was that a broken wrist?

428
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,941
I can't read
that scribbling.

429
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,860
I mean,
I have to bill these people.

430
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:05,987
I know you doctors
are the ministering angels,

431
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,114
and I'm the bitch from
the accounting department,

432
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,532
but I have my job to do,
too.

433
00:24:09,615 --> 00:24:11,367
I mean,
if you don't mind, doctor.

434
00:24:11,451 --> 00:24:14,203
The kid had a colly fracture,
we had him in the O.R.,

435
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,497
we reduced it, and
we gave him a small cast.

436
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,583
But did you
give him a sling?

437
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,668
You must've taken x-rays.

438
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:23,880
How am I supposed
to make out the charges?

439
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,383
Dr. Kurt, Dr. Sean Kurt.

440
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,471
Dr. Hardeck, Dr. Hardeck.

441
00:24:32,555 --> 00:24:33,973
Are you Mitgang?

442
00:24:34,265 --> 00:24:36,726
Uh, I'm Mitgang.

443
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:38,227
I'm Mitgang.

444
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,483
Do you carry
blue cross, blue shield,

445
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:45,318
Mr. Mitgang,
if you don't mind?

446
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:49,363
Do you have
your card with you?

447
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:50,490
Oh!

448
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,700
Do you know your number?

449
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:53,826
Uh!

450
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,912
Mr. Mitgang,
you are not leaving this room

451
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,288
until I have
this information.

452
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,623
Will you leave
that man alone?

453
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:04,545
Do you mind if I at least ask this
gentleman to fill out his chart?

454
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,173
Let me have a c.c. Of adrenalin...

455
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:15,556
May I have your A.H.S.
Policy number, sir?

456
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:19,519
Do you carry blue cross?

457
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,145
Blue shield?

458
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,563
...Mrs. Ferguson.

459
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,357
Yes, doctor.

460
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:28,778
Dr. Spezio!

461
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:32,907
I think one of your patients in here
is dead, Dr. Spezio.

462
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:35,076
Why do you say that,
Mrs. Cushing?

463
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,996
Because he wouldn't give me
his blue cross number, Dr. Spezio.

464
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,008
Christ!

465
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,970
How the hell long has
this man been lying here?

466
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,138
Isn't this the doctor
that came in around 9:00?

467
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:58,891
"For Pete's sake,"
I said, "this is a hospital.

468
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,310
One of our feed
lines just blew."

469
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:03,688
I mean, we're lucky
to trace it in time.

470
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,690
Have we covered
just about everything?

471
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,151
Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts
about the O.R. schedule.

472
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,654
He's supposed to
see me about that.

473
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:13,990
This is
the emergency room.

474
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:16,158
One of the doctors
just died of a heart attack.

475
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,285
One of our staff?

476
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,744
I think so.

477
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:23,874
Tom, you want to go down
to the emergency room?

478
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,126
One of our doctors
just died.

479
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,377
What,
another one?

480
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,587
Yeah.
See what that's about.

481
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:29,505
I'll be on Holly 8,
and I'll be right back.

482
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:31,674
It's no longer pilferage, Milton,

483
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:34,051
it's reached
the point of piracy.

484
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:35,970
That's the 3rd
microscope this month.

485
00:26:36,053 --> 00:26:38,514
Why can't we get together on this
sometime this afternoon?

486
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:39,599
How about 1:00?

487
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:40,683
1:00 will be fine.

488
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,476
Your brother's in his room,
Mr. Mead.

489
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,603
What one is it?

490
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:44,729
806.

491
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,315
Dr. George Marasco.

492
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:50,109
Dr. Joseph sheen,
Dr. Joseph sheen.

493
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,362
For heaven's sake, Willie,

494
00:26:53,446 --> 00:26:55,448
you're gonna be in the hospital
for 2 lousy days.

495
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,033
What're you making
such a fuss about?

496
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,035
You're supposed to be
such a big wheel here.

497
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:00,661
There are no
private rooms available.

498
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:02,872
If they brought in Jesus Christ
fresh off the cross,

499
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,373
I couldn't get him
a private room.

500
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,584
Well, I'm not staying in a room
with a dying man.

501
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:07,960
He's not dying.

502
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,588
They'll screen him off.
You won't even know he's here.

503
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:12,381
If you want a private room,
go on home.

504
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:14,342
And I'll call you
the first one that comes up.

505
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:16,761
But you phoned me in a panic,
you're going on a vacation.

506
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:19,305
For heaven's sake,
they'll cut this polyp out tomorrow,

507
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,641
you'll be home Thursday,
you'll be in Miami Friday.

508
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:23,851
Marilyn, will you talk
some sense into this lunatic?

509
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,561
You said it.
He's a lunatic.

510
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,188
Big wheel!

511
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,190
Can't even get me
a private room.

512
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,900
I'll get you a tranquilizer.

513
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:33,486
"5. a full

514
00:27:35,363 --> 00:27:36,614
abdomen..."

515
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,660
Contrasted with
wasting elsewhere.

516
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,828
"6. ascites..."

517
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,832
With a protein
content above 4 grams.

518
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,377
Unexplained anemia,
leukopenia.

519
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,880
Unexplained elevation of the serum
gamma globulin level.

520
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:55,591
Especially
abnormal flocculation tests,

521
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,259
and of course,
a positive P.P.D.

522
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,387
Now, all of these findings,

523
00:27:59,762 --> 00:28:01,972
um, assume special
significance in negroes.

524
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:03,349
Ahem.

525
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:05,685
Well, this has been
a very commendable workup.

526
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:09,021
It's as commendable a workup of an F.U.O.
As I can remember.

527
00:28:09,146 --> 00:28:11,982
The staff on this floor
is to be applauded.

528
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,777
All right, let's go
take a look at the girl.

529
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:17,154
It's a reportable case,
Brubaker. I'd write it up.

530
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,239
Thank you, sir.

531
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,534
Nurse.

532
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,495
Uh, nurse, who's the senior
resident on this floor?

533
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,288
That would be
Dr. Brubaker.

534
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:29,542
Oh, but I'm afraid he's at chief
of service rounds right now.

535
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,751
That's this way?

536
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,961
Mmm-hmm.

537
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,465
I wonder if there might not be
some correlation between

538
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:39,135
hepatic tuberculosis
and drug addiction.

539
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:42,263
Presumably, there was an early
consideration of S.B.E.?

540
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,432
Yes, sir. We discounted
it after, uh,

541
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:46,142
repeated blood cultures
were negative.

542
00:28:46,225 --> 00:28:47,810
You, ambler.
Is that right, "ambler"?

543
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:48,894
Yes, sir.

544
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:51,230
What else do you look for
in bacterial endocarditis?

545
00:28:53,107 --> 00:28:55,609
Dr. Gary Hardman.

546
00:28:56,777 --> 00:28:59,905
Dr. Brubaker,
can I see you for a minute, please?

547
00:28:59,989 --> 00:29:02,241
Mrs. Christie,
Angela Christie.

548
00:29:06,287 --> 00:29:08,831
Still a little icteric.
Who's got an ophthalmoscope?

549
00:29:14,712 --> 00:29:16,797
Did anyone note Roth spots?

550
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:20,885
Don't worry about it.
There aren't any.

551
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:25,431
Ambler, you're our big man
on S.B.E.,

552
00:29:25,514 --> 00:29:27,016
what was the latex fixation?

553
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,684
It wasn't done, sir.

554
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:29,810
No?

555
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,190
Well, don't you think
that's an important test

556
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,358
to differentiate S.B.E.
From miliary B.B.?

557
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:38,194
Not you, Biegelman. Ambler.

558
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,738
Well, there's about
a 70 percent incidence

559
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,615
of false-positive latex
in S.B.E.

560
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,950
Well,
you have been reading up.

561
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,036
If the diagnosis
were S.B.E.,

562
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,872
would a positive latex
indicate anything in the therapy?

563
00:29:49,997 --> 00:29:51,832
We'd expect the latex
to become negative.

564
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,958
If?

565
00:29:53,042 --> 00:29:55,461
If the antibiotic
therapy were successful.

566
00:29:55,711 --> 00:29:57,588
Are you applying for
your internship here?

567
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:59,131
I'm not sure.

568
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:00,299
Come and see me.

569
00:30:00,382 --> 00:30:02,384
Would you sit up,
please, miss?

570
00:30:15,189 --> 00:30:17,817
We've got a little
thing here, doctor.

571
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,863
The girl over there is the daughter
of the patient in 806.

572
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:24,532
He is at the moment
comatose,

573
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:26,951
and requires intravenous
feeding and meds.

574
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,245
The thing is, the daughter wants
to take the father

575
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,122
out of the hospital and back to Mexico,
where they live.

576
00:30:32,206 --> 00:30:33,582
The patient's
name is Drummond.

577
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,376
He's apparently
a methodist missionary.

578
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,169
And he and his daughter
run some kind of

579
00:30:37,253 --> 00:30:39,505
religious mission
among the Apache Indians.

580
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:42,007
The daughter claims
to be a licensed nurse,

581
00:30:42,091 --> 00:30:44,385
so she can give the necessary
I.V.S and treatment.

582
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,012
I certainly don't think
he should be let out of the hospital.

583
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,557
The attending, that's the guy in brown
over there, concurs.

584
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,976
Wait, let me
have all that again.

585
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,854
As a matter of fact,
doctor, this is Dr. Biegelman's case.

586
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:57,690
Well, never mind the professional ethics.
What happened?

587
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,276
I don't know why
I'm covering up

588
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:03,195
for that son of a bitch
in Farkis Pavilion anyway.

589
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:04,905
The patient, a man of 56,

590
00:31:04,989 --> 00:31:07,741
was admitted to the hospital
10 days ago in good health,

591
00:31:07,825 --> 00:31:09,827
for a checkup.
No visible distress.

592
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,704
We did the mandatory
workup on him.

593
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,707
Blood cultures, stool, L.E. Preps,
chest E.K.G., all negative.

594
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:17,751
However, there was some evidence
of protein in his urine.

595
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:20,796
I don't know how that guy in Farkis
Pavilion found out about it.

596
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,716
Maybe he had one of...
a deal with one of the girls in the lab,

597
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:25,384
anyway,
he turned up the next day,

598
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:28,429
conned the patient into signing
an authorization for a biopsy.

599
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,222
What son of a bitch
in Farkis Pavillion?

600
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,891
Some postgrad
fellow named Ives.

601
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:33,434
An Elroy Ives.
I never met him.

602
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:35,644
He's on one of the immunology
research programs.

603
00:31:35,728 --> 00:31:38,522
Some postgrad came up here,
did a biopsy on the patient?

604
00:31:38,606 --> 00:31:40,816
Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman
with that story...

605
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,568
protein in the urine?

606
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,903
And he biopsied
the man?

607
00:31:43,986 --> 00:31:45,321
And he nicked
a vessel in it.

608
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:47,323
At 2:00 in the morning,
they woke up Biegelman,

609
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,199
because the nurse found
the patient in shock.

610
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,452
He called the kidney people
for a consult right away.

611
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:54,580
But what was there to see?
The patient was sour and bleeding.

612
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,206
Spoke to this fellow,
Sutcliff.

613
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,375
He referred us to
a surgeon named Welbeck.

614
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,585
Welbeck!
that barber?

615
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,836
You ain't heard
nothing yet.

616
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,130
We finally got Welbeck
around 4:00 in the morning.

617
00:32:03,213 --> 00:32:05,674
He said, go ahead.
So they laid on the surgery for 8:00.

618
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:07,176
Welbeck turned up
half-stoned,

619
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,219
orders an I.V.P.,
clears him for allergies...

620
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,554
- without actually testing?
- Right.

621
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:11,972
And the patient
went into shock.

622
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,349
And tubular necrosis.

623
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,934
They lopped out
the bleeding kidney,

624
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:17,353
ran him back to the room,
we sat around waiting for urine.

625
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,521
Fever began spiking
like hell, uremia,

626
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:21,690
vomiting.
so we arranged hemodialysis.

627
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:23,859
He's putting out
good water now,

628
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:26,028
but some nurse goofed
on his last treatment.

629
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,863
A shunt separated,
something.

630
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:28,989
Blood pressure plunged.

631
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,282
They ran him up to I.C.U.,

632
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:31,700
gave him 2 units
of whole blood.

633
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:34,203
All vital signs are normal now,
except he's comatose.

634
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,496
That was 2 days ago.

635
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,789
In short...

636
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:40,417
A man comes into this hospital
in perfect health,

637
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:43,921
and in the space of one week,
we chop out one kidney,

638
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:47,091
damage another, reduce him to coma,
and damn near kill him.

639
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,258
Yes, sir.

640
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:51,762
You know, Brubaker,

641
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:54,807
last night I sat
in my hotel room,

642
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:57,267
reviewing the shambles
of my life

643
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:59,561
and contemplating suicide.

644
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:02,648
I said,
"no, Bock, don't do it.

645
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,150
"You're a doctor,
you're a healer.

646
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,904
"You're the chief of medicine at one
of the great hospitals of the world.

647
00:33:08,988 --> 00:33:12,366
You are a necessary person.
Your life is meaningful."

648
00:33:13,283 --> 00:33:15,327
Then I walk in here
today,

649
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,246
and I find out that
one of my doctors

650
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:18,872
was killed by
a couple of nurses

651
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,416
who mistook him
for a patient

652
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,043
because he screwed a technician
from the nephrology lab.

653
00:33:23,127 --> 00:33:24,169
Hematology...

654
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:25,254
and now,
you come to me

655
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,423
with this Gothic
horror story in which

656
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,591
the entire machinery
of modern medicine

657
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:33,303
has apparently conspired
to destroy one lousy patient.

658
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:37,266
Now, how am I to sustain
my feeling

659
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,977
of meaningfulness
in the face of this?

660
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,813
I'll tell you something,
Brubaker.

661
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,859
If there were
an oven around here,

662
00:33:47,735 --> 00:33:49,695
I'd stick my head in it.

663
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:53,782
Now, what was the name of that son
of a bitch from Farkis Pavilion, again?

664
00:33:53,866 --> 00:33:55,951
Ives, sir.
Elroy Ives.

665
00:33:56,035 --> 00:33:57,453
Somebody ought
to ream his ass.

666
00:33:57,578 --> 00:33:59,038
I'm going to
ream his ass.

667
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,789
I'm gonna break
that Welbeck's back.

668
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,624
I'll defrock
those 2 cannibals.

669
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,668
They will never again
practice in this hospital.

670
00:34:04,752 --> 00:34:06,086
I'll tell you that.

671
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,463
What'll I tell the girl,
sir?

672
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:08,797
She says we have
no legal right

673
00:34:08,881 --> 00:34:10,549
to stop her from
taking her father out.

674
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:12,760
She's willing to
sign an a.O.R. Form.

675
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,470
Let him go...

676
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:17,264
Before we kill him.

677
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:21,810
Oh, uh, herb.

678
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,896
Get me Dr. Gilley.
I want to talk to him right now.

679
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,314
Put him on page
if you have to.

680
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,648
I don't care if
he's operating.

681
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:28,567
And you get me some
monkey named Ives.

682
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,778
Ives, I-V-E-S.
First name, Elroy.

683
00:34:31,153 --> 00:34:32,488
He's in the Farkis Pavilion.

684
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:35,574
I want to talk to you, Joe.
Come in my office, please.

685
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:39,161
You got some punk rotating
in your department, named Ives?

686
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,122
Also, I want to ask you what kind
of dialysis room you're running.

687
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,917
Excuse me.

688
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:47,419
Yeah.
Gilley? Bock.

689
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:50,506
Listen, didn't you tell me
a couple of months ago,

690
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:53,801
you were gonna cut off all privileges
for that assassin, Welbeck?

691
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:54,927
Welbeck, yes!

692
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,429
He just butchered
another one of my patients!

693
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,473
Oh, come on, Harry,
the man's a buccaneer.

694
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:02,142
I want him brought up before the medical
executive committee.

695
00:35:02,434 --> 00:35:04,478
Well, he's in your department,
Harry, not mine.

696
00:35:04,561 --> 00:35:06,605
He's putatively a surgeon!

697
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,524
I'll be here.

698
00:35:09,108 --> 00:35:10,109
Listen, Joe,

699
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,861
I think you should know you've got some
research guy named Ives

700
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,531
in your department who's doing some
dubious biopsies.

701
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,658
Now, we're having enough problems
squeezing grants

702
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:19,076
out of the Nixon
administration...

703
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,120
Ives is dead, herb.
That's why I'm here.

704
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,248
What do you mean
Ives is dead?

705
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,332
I mean he's dead.

706
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:28,293
He had a heart attack
in the emergency room.

707
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,587
He had a heart attack
in the emergency room?

708
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:31,797
Yeah.

709
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,842
What in the hell is this, some kind
of plague? Where is he now?

710
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,844
They were just taking him
down to pathology.

711
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,972
And the next thing anybody knew,
about 3 hours later,

712
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,142
Mrs. Cushing came in and said there was
a dead man in the holding room.

713
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:46,562
You don't find anything a little grotesque
about all this?

714
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,272
What do you mean?

715
00:35:48,397 --> 00:35:50,023
I mean,
that at 8:30 this morning

716
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,651
we meet over a doctor
who's killed intravenously,

717
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,571
and now here we are again 4 hours later,
with another doctor

718
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,157
who's died of a heart attack
in the emergency room.

719
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,075
Well, what are you
suggesting, doctor?

720
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,245
You think we have a mad killer stalking
the halls of the hospital?

721
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:05,289
Presumably, Dr. Ives
died of a heart attack,

722
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:07,082
and Schaefer in
a diabetic coma.

723
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,209
People do die
of these things.

724
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:10,669
It's all, perhaps
coincidental,

725
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,462
but I don't think
I'd call it grotesque.

726
00:36:12,546 --> 00:36:15,174
How long are they
gonna be on Schaefer's post?

727
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:25,017
I don't suppose you'd like
to call next-of-kin?

728
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,476
No, thanks.

729
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,646
God, I need a drink.

730
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:15,859
Mead.

731
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:35,003
Mr. Mead?

732
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,716
Mr. Mead,
I have an injection for you.

733
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,702
What the hell is
going on in there?

734
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,120
Shh.

735
00:38:53,332 --> 00:38:56,585
Well, honey, we got
a witch doctor in 806,

736
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,587
and you better go in there.

737
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:01,006
You know that Indian
that was sitting in 806 all night?

738
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,466
He's still there.

739
00:39:02,549 --> 00:39:04,301
And the girl's there,

740
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,470
and they're doing
some voodoo in there.

741
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,096
And I ain't kiddin'!

742
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,098
What're you
talking about?

743
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,893
I mean, that
Indian's in there,

744
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,187
half-naked,
going psst, psst, psst.

745
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,646
With a little bag.

746
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,566
You just better get
in there, Mrs. Dunne.

747
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,209
You wanna see somethin',
baby?

748
00:39:37,292 --> 00:39:38,752
You just come here.

749
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:43,590
Look, it's a perfectly
harmless ceremony.

750
00:39:43,673 --> 00:39:45,092
It's nothing to
get excited about.

751
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:47,135
It'll be over in
a few minutes, anyway.

752
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,096
Mr. Blacktree is a shaman

753
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:51,014
who gets his power
from the thunder,

754
00:39:51,098 --> 00:39:53,141
and it's imperative
he conclude his ritual

755
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:55,143
while the storm
is still going on.

756
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,938
Visiting hours
were over at 9:00, miss.

757
00:39:58,188 --> 00:39:59,856
All that's going on
in there, doctor,

758
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,066
is a simple
Apache prayer

759
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,151
for my father's recovery.

760
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:41,148
The, uh, markings he's made
on my father's arms

761
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:43,066
are from the pollen
of the tule plant.

762
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,860
The twigs have
no significance,

763
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,778
other than they've been
struck by lightning

764
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,781
and are consequently appeals
to the spirit of lightning.

765
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,783
It's all entirely harmless,
doctor.

766
00:40:51,867 --> 00:40:54,202
A religious ceremony,
not a medical one.

767
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,454
You don't seriously
believe

768
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:58,165
all that mumbo-jumbo's
gonna cure him?

769
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:00,876
On the other hand,
it won't kill him, doctor.

770
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,127
OK. Go ahead.

771
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,253
Thanks.

772
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:05,172
You still gonna take your father out,
miss Drummond?

773
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:07,007
Yeah, I have to
arrange an ambulance.

774
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,508
Is there a phone
here I could use?

775
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:09,885
Use my office.

776
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,303
Thank you.

777
00:43:00,662 --> 00:43:02,956
Hello, I'd like to
arrange an ambulance.

778
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:05,250
Yeah, I'd like to arrange an ambulance
at 1:30,

779
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:06,668
tomorrow afternoon.

780
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:08,587
Drummond.
First name, Barbara.

781
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,171
I'll pay cash.

782
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:14,634
No, you're to pick up my father,
Drummond, Edward,

783
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:17,095
at the Manhattan
medical center,

784
00:43:17,178 --> 00:43:19,431
Holly pavilion,
room 806.

785
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:24,185
It's a stretcher case.
I presume you provide the stretcher.

786
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:25,729
Yeah.

787
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:29,107
Uh, no, he's to be taken to
American airlines,

788
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,233
Kennedy airport,

789
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,902
flight 729 to
Yuma, Arizona.

790
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:36,364
I'll accompany the patient.
Yeah, thank you.

791
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:50,211
You believe in witchcraft,
miss Drummond?

792
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,714
I believe in everything,
doctor.

793
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:56,635
You like a drink?

794
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:57,844
Yeah.

795
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:06,436
My father,
you should know,

796
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:09,189
was a very successful
doctor in Boston.

797
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:12,567
A member of the Harvard
medical faculty.

798
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,153
He was a widower,
and I was his only child.

799
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:17,155
He was not an especially
religious man,

800
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:18,907
a sober methodist.

801
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,076
One evening, about 7 years ago,
he attended

802
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,703
a pentecostal meeting
in the commons rooms at Harvard

803
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,914
and suddenly found himself
speaking in tongues.

804
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,957
That is to say,
he sank to his knees

805
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,335
at the back of the room
and began to talk fluently

806
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,921
in a language which no one
had ever heard before.

807
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:36,007
This sort of thing happens frequently
at pentecostal meetings,

808
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:38,468
and began happening
regularly to my father.

809
00:44:38,593 --> 00:44:40,553
It was not unusual
to walk into our home

810
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:42,555
and find my father
sitting in his office,

811
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,099
utterly serene,

812
00:44:44,224 --> 00:44:45,684
happily speaking to the air

813
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,936
in this strange,
foreign tongue.

814
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,855
I was, at that time,
20 years old

815
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,525
having my obligatory affair
with a minority group.

816
00:44:53,608 --> 00:44:55,151
In my case,
a Hopi Indian,

817
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:57,362
a postgraduate fellow
at Harvard

818
00:44:57,445 --> 00:45:00,907
doing his doctorate in aboriginal
languages of the southwest.

819
00:45:01,032 --> 00:45:04,327
One day,
I brought the Indian boy home

820
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,371
just as my father was
sinking to his knees

821
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:09,040
in the entrance foyer
in one of his trances.

822
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,709
The Indian wheeled
in his tracks,

823
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:14,129
and he said,
"well, I'll be a son of a bitch!"

824
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,049
You see, my father
was speaking an Apache dialect,

825
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:20,135
an obscure dialect,
at that,

826
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:23,805
spoken only by a ragged band
of unreconstructed Indians

827
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,765
who had rejected
the reservation,

828
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,726
and gone to live
in total isolation

829
00:45:27,809 --> 00:45:30,228
in the Sierra madre mountains
in northern Mexico.

830
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:32,063
Well, what do you
say to that, Dr. Bock?

831
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,984
What the hell am I supposed to say
to that, miss Drummond?

832
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,780
I'm sitting here boozing,
and you come in and tell me

833
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:44,033
some demented story about your father's
religious conversion.

834
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:45,660
Oh, no,
you miss the point, doctor.

835
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:48,163
Not my father's
conversion, mine.

836
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,414
You see, I'd been

837
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:52,041
hitting the acid pretty
regularly at that time.

838
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:54,794
I had achieved a few
minor sensory deformities,

839
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:56,546
some suicidal despairs,

840
00:45:56,671 --> 00:46:00,341
but nothing as wild
as fluency in an obscure Apache dialect.

841
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,343
I mean, like, "wow, man!"

842
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,513
Here was living afflatus
right before my eyes!

843
00:46:05,764 --> 00:46:09,142
Within a week, my father had closed
his beacon hill practice

844
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:11,978
and set out to start a mission
in the Mexican mountains.

845
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:14,481
I turned in my S.D.S. Card
and my crash helmet,

846
00:46:14,564 --> 00:46:16,065
and I followed him.

847
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,693
It was a disaster,
at least for me.

848
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,780
My father had received
the revelation, not I.

849
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,782
He stood gaunt
on a mountain slope

850
00:46:23,865 --> 00:46:25,116
and preached the apocalypse

851
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,202
to solemnly amused Indians.

852
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,703
I masturbated a great deal.

853
00:46:28,787 --> 00:46:29,954
We lived in a grass wickiup,

854
00:46:30,038 --> 00:46:33,208
ate raw rabbit and crushed pinion nuts.
It was hideous.

855
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:35,710
Within 2 months,
I was back in Boston.

856
00:46:35,794 --> 00:46:36,920
A hollow shell,

857
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:40,465
disenchanted with everything,
and dizzy with dengue.

858
00:46:40,882 --> 00:46:42,717
I turned to austerity,

859
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:44,761
combed my hair tight,
entered nursing school.

860
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:47,055
I became haggard,
driven,

861
00:46:47,597 --> 00:46:50,892
had shamelessly incestuous
dreams about my father.

862
00:46:51,726 --> 00:46:53,978
I took up with some
of the senior staff at the hospital.

863
00:46:54,062 --> 00:46:56,481
One of them,
a portly psychiatrist,

864
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:00,443
explained I was generated by an unresolved
lust, for my father.

865
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:02,570
I cracked up.

866
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,989
One day, they found me
walking to work naked,

867
00:47:05,073 --> 00:47:07,158
and screaming obscenities.

868
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,911
There was talk of
institutionalizing me.

869
00:47:10,078 --> 00:47:12,205
So I packed a bag
and went back to

870
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,833
join my father in
the Sierra madre mountains.

871
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,836
I've been there ever since.
That's 3 years.

872
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,922
My father is, of course,
as mad as a hatter.

873
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,384
I watch over him, and
have been curiously content.

874
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:28,930
You see, doctor,
I believe in everything.

875
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,935
What was that all about,
miss Drummond?

876
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,604
I thought I was
obvious as hell.

877
00:47:36,938 --> 00:47:40,441
I'm trying to tell you,
I have a thing about middle-aged men.

878
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,443
I admire your candor.

879
00:47:43,278 --> 00:47:46,114
You've been admiring
a lot more than that.

880
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,452
You're wasting
your time.

881
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,455
I've been impotent
for years.

882
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:56,958
Rubbish.

883
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,628
What the hell is
wrong with being impotent?

884
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:06,593
Kids are more hung up on sex
than the Victorians.

885
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,429
I got a son, 23 years old.

886
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,139
I threw him out
of the house last year.

887
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,182
Pietistic little humbug.

888
00:48:14,601 --> 00:48:17,979
He preached universal love,
and he despised everyone.

889
00:48:18,855 --> 00:48:20,982
Had a blanket contempt
for the middle class,

890
00:48:21,065 --> 00:48:22,400
even its decencies.

891
00:48:22,984 --> 00:48:24,986
Detested my mother
because she had

892
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:28,489
a petit bourgeois pride
in her son, the doctor.

893
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,285
I cannot tell you how

894
00:48:32,493 --> 00:48:34,829
brutishly he ignored
that rather good lady.

895
00:48:36,915 --> 00:48:37,916
When she died,

896
00:48:37,999 --> 00:48:40,335
he didn't even come
to the funeral.

897
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:43,838
He felt the, uh, chapel service
was an hypocrisy.

898
00:48:46,257 --> 00:48:48,718
He told me his generation
didn't live with lies.

899
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:52,597
I said, "listen,
everybody lives with lies."

900
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,478
I grabbed him by his poncho,

901
00:48:59,646 --> 00:49:01,898
and I dragged him the length

902
00:49:02,398 --> 00:49:05,026
of our 7-room,
despicably affluent

903
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:08,821
middle-class apartment,
and I flung him out.

904
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,371
I haven't seen him since.

905
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,793
You know what
he said to me?

906
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:24,963
He's standing there
on the landing,

907
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:26,965
on the verge of tears.

908
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,051
He shrieked at me:

909
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:33,846
"You old fink.

910
00:49:36,182 --> 00:49:38,559
You can't even
get it up anymore."

911
00:49:41,145 --> 00:49:42,939
That was it, you see.

912
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:45,942
That was
his real revolution.

913
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,237
It wasn't racism,

914
00:49:50,071 --> 00:49:53,074
the oppressed poor,
or the war in Vietnam.

915
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:57,954
No, the ultimate

916
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,373
American societal
sickness

917
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:02,667
was a limp dingus.

918
00:50:04,377 --> 00:50:05,586
My god.

919
00:50:08,798 --> 00:50:10,508
If there is a despised,

920
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,969
misunderstood minority
in this country,

921
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:15,054
it is us poor,
impotent bastards.

922
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:17,473
Well, I'm impotent,
and I'm proud of it.

923
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:20,268
Impotence is beautiful,
baby!

924
00:50:21,310 --> 00:50:23,688
Power to the impotent!
Right on, baby!

925
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,106
Right on!

926
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,651
You know,

927
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,530
When I say impotent,

928
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:35,283
I don't mean merely limp.

929
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:38,911
Disagreeable as it
may be for a woman,

930
00:50:39,037 --> 00:50:41,456
a man may lust
for other things...

931
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:46,669
Something a little less
transient than an erection.

932
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,881
A sense of permanent worth.

933
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:51,966
That's what
medicine was to me,

934
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:53,634
my reason for being.

935
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:55,011
You know,

936
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,180
miss Drummond,

937
00:50:58,765 --> 00:51:00,266
When I was 34,

938
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,061
I presented a paper

939
00:51:03,311 --> 00:51:04,771
before the annual convention

940
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,898
of the society
of clinical investigation

941
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,734
that pioneered the whole goddamn field
of immunology.

942
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,319
A breakthrough.

943
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:13,488
I'm in all the textbooks.

944
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:17,033
I happen to be an eminent man,
miss Drummond.

945
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,703
You know something else,
miss Drummond?

946
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:22,747
I don't give a goddamn.

947
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:27,001
When I say impotent,

948
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,298
I mean I've lost
even my desire to work.

949
00:51:34,342 --> 00:51:37,678
That's a hell of a lot more
primal passion than sex.

950
00:51:38,763 --> 00:51:40,973
I've lost my
reason for being.

951
00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:42,767
My purpose.

952
00:51:45,186 --> 00:51:47,605
The only thing
I ever truly loved.

953
00:51:51,984 --> 00:51:53,111
Well,

954
00:51:54,403 --> 00:51:56,531
it is all rubbish, isn't it?

955
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,700
I mean,

956
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:01,786
transplants,

957
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,247
antibodies,

958
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:08,334
we manufacture genes.

959
00:52:09,335 --> 00:52:11,921
We can produce
birth ectogenetically.

960
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:15,883
We can practically
clone people like carrots,

961
00:52:16,843 --> 00:52:18,427
and half the kids
in this ghetto

962
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:21,180
haven't even been
inoculated for polio!

963
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:26,477
We have established
the most enormous

964
00:52:28,563 --> 00:52:31,732
medical entity
ever conceived,

965
00:52:31,899 --> 00:52:34,193
and people are
sicker than ever!

966
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:37,488
We cure nothing!

967
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:40,908
We heal nothing!

968
00:52:43,911 --> 00:52:47,248
The whole goddamn
wretched world...

969
00:52:51,252 --> 00:52:53,880
Strangulating in
front of our eyes.

970
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:00,928
That's what I mean
when I say impotent.

971
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:06,267
You don't know what the hell
I'm talking about, do you?

972
00:53:06,434 --> 00:53:08,394
Of course I do.

973
00:53:09,604 --> 00:53:10,938
Ah, I'm tired.

974
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:13,274
I'm very tired,
miss Drummond.

975
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:16,277
And I hurt.

976
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:19,572
And I've got nothing
going for me anymore.

977
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:21,282
Can you understand that?

978
00:53:21,574 --> 00:53:23,117
Yes, of course.

979
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,953
Can you also understand...

980
00:53:26,996 --> 00:53:29,999
That the only admissible
matter left is death?

981
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:36,422
Sounds to me like a familiar case
of morbid menopause.

982
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:37,965
Oh, Christ.

983
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:41,093
It's hard for me to take your despair
very seriously, doctor.

984
00:53:41,177 --> 00:53:42,762
You obviously
enjoy it so much.

985
00:53:42,845 --> 00:53:44,430
Ah, bugger off!

986
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:48,142
That's all I need now,
is clinical insight.

987
00:53:48,226 --> 00:53:51,062
Some cockamamie
25-year-old acidhead

988
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:54,065
is gonna reassure me
about the menopause now!

989
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:00,613
I'd...I'd like to be alone.
Why don't you just beat it?

990
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:05,159
Close the door and turn off the lights
on your way out.

991
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:16,128
Mr. Blacktree disapproves
of my miniskirt,

992
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:19,257
but it was the only thing I had
to come to the city with.

993
00:54:20,091 --> 00:54:22,843
Back at the tribe,
I wear ankle-length buckskin.

994
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,345
Swell.

995
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,932
Close the door
and turn off the lights.

996
00:56:22,421 --> 00:56:24,215
What're you
shooting, doc?

997
00:56:29,345 --> 00:56:30,888
Leave me alone.

998
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:39,563
Potassium.

999
00:56:40,314 --> 00:56:43,317
You take enough of this stuff, doc,
it'll kill you.

1000
00:56:43,484 --> 00:56:45,486
It occurred to me I might
have read you wrong,

1001
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,197
and that you really
were suicidal, so I came back.

1002
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,158
Who asked you?

1003
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:00,668
Leave me alone!
Why can't you leave me alone?

1004
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,091
Leave me alone.

1005
00:57:10,261 --> 00:57:12,388
Why didn't you let me do it?

1006
00:57:46,881 --> 00:57:48,591
Well, I'll see you.

1007
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,587
Do you have
a match, doctor?

1008
00:58:54,365 --> 00:58:56,116
You wouldn't be awake?

1009
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,160
What time is it?

1010
00:58:58,244 --> 00:58:59,537
Almost 7:00.

1011
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:01,580
I, uh...

1012
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,834
Swiped this for you out of
the nurses' locker room.

1013
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,920
I'll make good
on your dress.

1014
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:09,797
I'm afraid it was
torn beyond repair.

1015
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,090
I'll buy you a new one,

1016
00:59:11,173 --> 00:59:13,842
or if you like, give me the size
and I'll send it on to you.

1017
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,512
Uh, anyway, I wanna talk
to you about that.

1018
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,138
Talk to me
about what?

1019
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:20,224
Your father.

1020
00:59:21,433 --> 00:59:24,311
You really shouldn't take him out of here
in his condition.

1021
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:25,896
I've just been
looking at his chart.

1022
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,107
There's no reason
to presume brain damage.

1023
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:31,694
You know as well as I, you can't predict
anything in these instances, but, uh,

1024
00:59:31,777 --> 00:59:34,154
he could very well come out of that coma
at any time.

1025
00:59:34,238 --> 00:59:35,739
I think you
should leave him here.

1026
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:37,408
I'll personally
look after him.

1027
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,326
Is this your way of saying

1028
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:41,704
you'd like me to stay
in town a few more days?

1029
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,623
Well, that would
be nice, too.

1030
00:59:45,541 --> 00:59:47,668
What do you say,
miss Drummond?

1031
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:49,628
I expect you can
call me Barbara,

1032
00:59:49,712 --> 00:59:52,381
considering you ravished me
3 times last night.

1033
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:53,465
3 times?

1034
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,302
Uh-huh. Look at him
pretending he didn't count.

1035
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,054
You were as puffed
up as a toad about it.

1036
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:00,973
Punched a couple of
holes in your crusade

1037
01:00:01,056 --> 01:00:02,850
for universal impotence,
didn't it?

1038
01:00:02,933 --> 01:00:06,186
I think we're on first-name basis now.
I'll call you herb.

1039
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:10,232
Let's give your father a week, Barbara.
What do you say?

1040
01:00:10,316 --> 01:00:11,317
Well...

1041
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,695
I don't want my father
in this hospital.

1042
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:17,781
I had a dream
about this hospital.

1043
01:00:18,115 --> 01:00:19,908
I dreamt this enormous

1044
01:00:19,992 --> 01:00:23,912
starched, white-tile building suddenly
erupted like a volcano...

1045
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:28,292
And all the patients, doctors, nurses,
attendants, orderlies,

1046
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:32,296
the whole line-staff, food-service people,
the aged, the lame,

1047
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,632
and you, right in the middle, were...

1048
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,594
Stampeding in one hideous, screaming,
suicidal mass into the sea.

1049
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:44,975
I'm taking my father out of here,
and as quickly as I can.

1050
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:51,649
You're really
a fruitcake, you know?

1051
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:52,775
Well...

1052
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:55,819
Let me put it this way, herb.

1053
01:00:55,903 --> 01:00:57,279
I love you.

1054
01:00:57,946 --> 01:01:00,240
I fancied you from
the first moment you came

1055
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,576
lumbering down
that hallway, upstairs.

1056
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:04,953
I said to
Mr. Blacktree,

1057
01:01:05,037 --> 01:01:07,289
"who's that hulking bear
of a man?"

1058
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,502
The Apaches are
reverential about bears.

1059
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,171
Won't eat bear meat,
never skin bears.

1060
01:01:14,254 --> 01:01:16,965
Bears are thought
of as both benign and evil,

1061
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,051
very strong power.

1062
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:21,220
Men with bear power
are highly respected.

1063
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:23,514
Frequently said
to be great healers.

1064
01:01:23,764 --> 01:01:27,059
"That man," I said,
"gets his power from the bear."

1065
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,020
Swell. Now, look.

1066
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,648
You haven't got
a hotel room

1067
01:01:32,731 --> 01:01:34,900
or some sort of accommodations
where you can stay...

1068
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:37,236
all right, let me
put it this way, herb.

1069
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,698
My father and I accept
the implacability of death.

1070
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,533
If he dies, he dies.

1071
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:45,536
I'm getting him out of here
and back to Mexico

1072
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:47,579
at 1:00, this afternoon.

1073
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,790
I want you to come with us,
because

1074
01:01:49,957 --> 01:01:51,792
I love you
and want children.

1075
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,048
I'm afraid Mexico
is a little too remote for me.

1076
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,759
Oh, we could really use you
down there, you know.

1077
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,220
There's a curiously
high incidence of T.B.

1078
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,514
You'd be a doctor again, herb.

1079
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,891
You'd be necessary again.

1080
01:02:08,517 --> 01:02:11,145
If you love me,
I don't see what other choice you have.

1081
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,855
What do you mean,
if I love you?

1082
01:02:12,938 --> 01:02:14,565
I raped you
in a suicidal rage.

1083
01:02:14,648 --> 01:02:16,817
How did we get to love and children
all of a sudden?

1084
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:19,236
Heaven's sake, I ought to know
if a man loves me or not.

1085
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:22,489
I mean, you must've told me
half a 100 times last night you loved me.

1086
01:02:22,573 --> 01:02:24,032
You murmured it,
shouted it.

1087
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:27,619
One time, you opened the window
and bellowed it out into the street.

1088
01:02:27,703 --> 01:02:30,497
Well, I think those were
more expressions of gratitude than love.

1089
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:31,999
Gratitude for what?

1090
01:02:32,082 --> 01:02:35,502
Oh, my god, for resurrecting
feelings of life in me I thought dead.

1091
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,421
Oh, my god,
what do you think love is?

1092
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:40,382
All right, I love you!
You love me!

1093
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:45,429
I'm not about to argue
with so relentless a romantic.

1094
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:50,225
Since we have this
great passion going for us,

1095
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:51,935
I don't see why you don't

1096
01:02:52,019 --> 01:02:54,146
stay around New York
for a week or 10 days?

1097
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:55,773
It's up to
10 days now.

1098
01:02:55,856 --> 01:02:58,358
Just as long as it takes your
father's condition to improve.

1099
01:02:58,442 --> 01:02:59,735
No.

1100
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,571
I've had these
prophetic dreams for 7 nights.

1101
01:03:02,654 --> 01:03:04,531
7 is a sinister number.

1102
01:03:04,615 --> 01:03:07,075
The meaning of
these dreams is very clear,

1103
01:03:07,159 --> 01:03:08,994
7 times as clear.

1104
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:11,371
I'm to get you
and my father out of here

1105
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,207
before we're all destroyed.

1106
01:03:13,874 --> 01:03:15,626
You're certifiable.

1107
01:03:15,751 --> 01:03:18,462
Half the time, you're a perfectly
intelligent young woman.

1108
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:21,381
Then all of a sudden, you turn into
some kind of goddamn Cabalist

1109
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:24,551
who believes in dreams
and witchcraft and bear power.

1110
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:27,763
I don't like the way you dismiss my whole
life as unnecessary, you know.

1111
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:29,723
I do a lot of healing right here
in Manhattan.

1112
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:31,433
I don't have to go
to Mexico to do it.

1113
01:03:31,517 --> 01:03:33,227
I also teach.

1114
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:36,355
I send out 80 doctors
a year into the world,

1115
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:39,149
often inspirited,
at least competent.

1116
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:42,861
I've built up one of the best damn
departments of medicine in the world.

1117
01:03:42,945 --> 01:03:44,822
We have a hell
of a heart unit,

1118
01:03:44,947 --> 01:03:46,782
we have a hell
of a kidney group.

1119
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,867
You know, a lot of people
come into this place

1120
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:50,160
in big trouble,
miss Drummond.

1121
01:03:50,244 --> 01:03:52,162
They go out a lot better
for the experience,

1122
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,831
so don't tell me
how unnecessary I am.

1123
01:03:53,914 --> 01:03:54,915
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1124
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,417
So how come 8 hours ago,
you were trying to kill yourself

1125
01:03:57,501 --> 01:03:59,336
with an overdose
of potassium?

1126
01:03:59,419 --> 01:04:00,504
Where are you
going now?

1127
01:04:00,587 --> 01:04:02,381
My hotel.
I have to check out.

1128
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,925
Mr. Blacktree
doesn't speak any English.

1129
01:04:05,008 --> 01:04:06,677
Well, you're coming back,
of course?

1130
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:10,013
Of course. I have to settle the bill,
pack my father.

1131
01:04:10,848 --> 01:04:14,351
I think you need a few hours
alone to make your decisions.

1132
01:04:14,434 --> 01:04:15,978
What decision?

1133
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,689
You're a very tired,
very damaged man.

1134
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:20,190
You've had
a hideous marriage,

1135
01:04:20,274 --> 01:04:22,442
I assume a few tacky affairs
along the way.

1136
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:23,944
You're understandably
reluctant

1137
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,362
to get involved again.

1138
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:28,323
On top of that, here I am
with this preposterous idea

1139
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:30,325
you throw everything up
and go off with me

1140
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,494
to some barren mountains
in Mexico.

1141
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,830
Utterly mad, I know.

1142
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:36,498
On the other hand,

1143
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:39,543
you obviously find this world
as desolate as I do.

1144
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:41,962
You did try to kill yourself
last night.

1145
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:44,047
So that's it, herb.

1146
01:04:44,464 --> 01:04:48,010
Either me and the mountains,
or the bottle of potassium.

1147
01:04:49,052 --> 01:04:52,764
I'll be back in an hour or so.
I'll be in my father's room.

1148
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:23,170
All right,
I love you!

1149
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:25,964
My god!

1150
01:05:31,637 --> 01:05:35,515
I repeat, I'm asking you
to come out peacefully.

1151
01:05:36,892 --> 01:05:40,646
These buildings are condemned
and unfit for habitation.

1152
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:44,942
You people are possessing
this building illegally

1153
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:47,778
and in violation of the law.

1154
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,781
I'm asking you
to come out peacefully.

1155
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,701
So the hospital has assumed
the responsibility

1156
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:58,330
for finding 400 housing units
in good buildings.

1157
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:01,208
The hospital wishes
to point out

1158
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:03,877
that this particular row
of buildings on first Avenue

1159
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,420
was condemned
by the city

1160
01:06:05,504 --> 01:06:07,881
before the hospital
acquired ownership

1161
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:10,509
and even then,
only after

1162
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:13,679
responsible leaders
in the community

1163
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:15,138
approved the building

1164
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:17,307
of our new
drug-rehabilitation center.

1165
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:19,059
Now, goddamn it, Barry,

1166
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:21,937
I've got a dozen community leaders
waiting for me in the library.

1167
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:23,397
Now, we're trying
to work out

1168
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,899
some kind of negotiable
formula for 2 years,

1169
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:27,693
with no help
from you people

1170
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:29,903
in the urban affairs division,
I might add.

1171
01:06:29,987 --> 01:06:31,113
No, that...

1172
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,825
No, no, I am not going to throw
all that down the drain

1173
01:06:34,908 --> 01:06:37,244
because some cockamamie
activist group

1174
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:40,122
is showboating for
the television cameras.

1175
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:43,000
Now, you get those people
out of those buildings

1176
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:46,003
before a wall collapses
or a fire breaks out

1177
01:06:46,253 --> 01:06:48,672
and we've got a riot
on our hands.

1178
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:50,716
OK.

1179
01:06:54,970 --> 01:06:56,638
Having your troubles, eh?

1180
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,682
Well, I won't take
much of your time.

1181
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,142
My name is Welbeck.

1182
01:07:00,434 --> 01:07:03,603
I've been associated
with this hospital for 6 years

1183
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:06,523
and yesterday afternoon,
Dr. Gilley called me

1184
01:07:06,606 --> 01:07:09,443
to tell me he was cutting off
my privileges with the hospital.

1185
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:11,153
Do you know
anything about that?

1186
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:12,696
That's news to me.

1187
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,364
He said he sent
the report on.

1188
01:07:14,448 --> 01:07:16,575
Well, I'll probably get
the report tomorrow.

1189
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:17,784
I assume...

1190
01:07:17,868 --> 01:07:19,661
a report about what?

1191
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:22,372
I'm not sure myself.

1192
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:26,043
I did a nephrectomy
on a man about 7 days ago.

1193
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:28,253
Emergency called in at 4:00
in the morning

1194
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:30,297
and the man was hemorrhaging.
He'd gone sour.

1195
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:33,300
Well, look, I'm really sorry, Welbeck.
I do have a meeting to go to.

1196
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:35,635
And in any event,
there's nothing I can do about it.

1197
01:07:35,719 --> 01:07:37,054
If Gilley, uh, oh...

1198
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:38,472
I'll be in the library.

1199
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:41,016
If Gilley wants to
cut your privileges,

1200
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,935
he's chief of surgery,
it's within his province.

1201
01:07:44,019 --> 01:07:45,687
You'll have to
have the hearing.

1202
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,814
Well, I have a laparotomy
laid on for this morning.

1203
01:07:47,898 --> 01:07:49,983
I assume I'll be able
to go through with that.

1204
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,819
I've been connected
with this hospital for 6 years.

1205
01:07:52,903 --> 01:07:56,323
Yeah, now, now, well, it seems to me
I've had your name down here before

1206
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:58,116
for something. Welbeck,

1207
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,077
wait a minute.

1208
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:02,287
You're the fellow
with the, uh...

1209
01:08:02,621 --> 01:08:05,457
You're the fellow with the
medicaid collecting business

1210
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:07,918
who incorporated
and went public, right?

1211
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,377
I mean, something
like that?

1212
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,630
Yeah, Milton Mead
was telling me about you.

1213
01:08:11,713 --> 01:08:13,757
Why, you're a whole
medical conglomerate.

1214
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,675
You've got
a factoring service,

1215
01:08:15,759 --> 01:08:17,511
a computerized
billing company,

1216
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,764
a few proprietary hospitals,
a few nursing homes.

1217
01:08:20,931 --> 01:08:23,391
Good heavens, Welbeck,
you shouldn't be brought up

1218
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:25,268
before a committee
of mere doctors.

1219
01:08:25,352 --> 01:08:28,438
You ought to be investigated by the
securities and exchange commission.

1220
01:08:28,522 --> 01:08:30,357
You'll have to go through
with the hearing.

1221
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,275
I...I can't do anything
about that.

1222
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:36,530
...imperializing
the black community.

1223
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:38,031
We reject the bourgeois,

1224
01:08:38,115 --> 01:08:40,283
middle-class black traitors
and flunkies

1225
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:42,661
who are selling out
the black proletarian masses

1226
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,538
to the expansionist,
racist policies...

1227
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,873
let's get back
to the abortion issue.

1228
01:08:46,957 --> 01:08:49,292
What the hell does
the male establishment

1229
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:50,961
know about abortion?

1230
01:08:51,044 --> 01:08:53,797
Who the hell raised
the issue of birth control?

1231
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:56,842
The issue at hand is
the control of drug addiction

1232
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:59,386
in this community
and in the ghetto, personally.

1233
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:01,680
We don't want no
goddamn abortion.

1234
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,932
Let's get to the core
of this matter.

1235
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,726
The point is
that this hospital

1236
01:09:06,810 --> 01:09:08,854
is the landlord
for those buildings

1237
01:09:08,937 --> 01:09:10,730
and instead of
tearing them down

1238
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,024
and building some
imperialistic extensions

1239
01:09:13,108 --> 01:09:14,568
of the medical establishment,

1240
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:17,320
this hospital ought to be
rebuilding those tenements!

1241
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:18,738
Give those people
decent housing!

1242
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:19,823
Please, please, please!

1243
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:26,830
You know, I...I hallucinated
last night.

1244
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:31,084
I hallucinated
there was an Indian

1245
01:09:31,168 --> 01:09:33,170
doing a war dance
in here.

1246
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:36,506
You weren't hallucinating,
Mr. Mead.

1247
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,592
There was an Indian
in here last night.

1248
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:40,010
There was?

1249
01:09:40,886 --> 01:09:43,138
OK. Down to the
operating room.

1250
01:09:45,849 --> 01:09:48,768
Dr. Rickie.

1251
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,645
Dr. Lionel Rickie.

1252
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:56,735
Dr. Norris said
about half an hour.

1253
01:09:56,818 --> 01:09:58,195
OK. That's fine.

1254
01:09:58,278 --> 01:09:59,779
Half an hour.

1255
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,364
Hold him
right there.

1256
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:02,574
Miss Shirley,

1257
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:04,868
it's just
an ovarian cyst, honey.

1258
01:10:05,202 --> 01:10:08,246
OK, Jerry, go up to Holly 6.

1259
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:11,416
On the double. Holly 6. Go.

1260
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:15,212
Who is that?
Is that Mangafranni?

1261
01:10:15,795 --> 01:10:17,505
Yeah. Number 3, Marty.

1262
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:20,634
Good morning, doctor.

1263
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:28,058
It's legal for a doctor to incorporate
in New York, isn't it, doctor?

1264
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,434
Since last September.

1265
01:10:29,517 --> 01:10:31,144
If they'd had that
when I was your age,

1266
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,230
I'd have put away
a couple of million by now.

1267
01:10:33,313 --> 01:10:35,732
It gives you a variety
of deferral devices.

1268
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:37,901
Profit sharing,
for example.

1269
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:41,238
Let's say you pick yourself
an October 31 fiscal.

1270
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,157
You declare a bonus
payable in '71.

1271
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,326
An accrued item payable

1272
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:48,578
to a principal shareholder
must be paid

1273
01:10:48,662 --> 01:10:50,997
within 2 and a half months
after the close of the year

1274
01:10:51,081 --> 01:10:53,041
to get the deduction
in the prior year.

1275
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:55,794
But your corporation
doesn't pay that tax,

1276
01:10:55,877 --> 01:10:59,506
because we've eliminated
the taxable income with the bonus.

1277
01:10:59,589 --> 01:11:01,007
With 2 taxable entities,

1278
01:11:01,091 --> 01:11:02,842
you can bury a hell
of a lot of expenses.

1279
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:05,262
Hello, this is Welbeck.
Any messages for me?

1280
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:07,806
Well, I'm at
the hospital.

1281
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,975
I gotta cut open some guy
in a couple of minutes.

1282
01:11:10,058 --> 01:11:12,018
I'll try to make it
as fast as I can.

1283
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,271
How urgent
did he say it was?

1284
01:11:15,438 --> 01:11:18,692
Doctor hogan made those arrangements
with the underwriters.

1285
01:11:18,775 --> 01:11:21,152
The registration statement
was filed with the S.E.C.

1286
01:11:21,236 --> 01:11:22,612
Well over a year ago.

1287
01:11:23,989 --> 01:11:26,116
Well, if he calls again,
have me paged here.

1288
01:11:35,750 --> 01:11:36,918
Mangafranni, right?

1289
01:11:37,002 --> 01:11:38,169
Right.

1290
01:11:38,378 --> 01:11:39,587
What do you say, huh?

1291
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:42,132
We're not gonna hang it
in the Louvre, you know.

1292
01:11:42,716 --> 01:11:44,467
There's no pulse,
doctor.

1293
01:11:44,551 --> 01:11:45,760
What's the pressure?

1294
01:11:45,844 --> 01:11:47,595
There's no blood pressure,
doctor.

1295
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:49,973
No pulse.
Get the tube and E.K.G.

1296
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,063
What's the matter?

1297
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:58,648
I can't feel
a thing here.

1298
01:11:58,732 --> 01:11:59,941
What the hell happened?

1299
01:12:00,025 --> 01:12:01,484
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

1300
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,906
I don't know, she must have
thrown an embolus.

1301
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,908
She was doing fine
up to now.

1302
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:10,952
Did you check
the gases?

1303
01:12:11,328 --> 01:12:12,495
I did, doctor.

1304
01:12:12,996 --> 01:12:15,373
'Cause the only time I saw
anyone conk out like this,

1305
01:12:15,457 --> 01:12:18,460
some jerk switched the nitrous oxide
and the gas lines.

1306
01:12:18,543 --> 01:12:20,337
Get the damn leads on.

1307
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,089
For Christ's sake,
what the hell is this?

1308
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:26,092
She's just a young woman, sir.
Do you think we should open the chest?

1309
01:12:26,176 --> 01:12:28,178
She's 53,
you button-head.

1310
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:29,721
Bicarb.

1311
01:12:33,433 --> 01:12:35,977
Jesus H. Christ!

1312
01:12:39,189 --> 01:12:41,066
OK, stop for a minute.

1313
01:12:42,233 --> 01:12:43,651
V-fib, doctor.

1314
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:45,195
Get me the paddles.

1315
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,286
I may be crazy, doctor,

1316
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:55,497
but I don't think
this is your patient.

1317
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,377
What the hell
are you talking about?

1318
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:12,055
I don't want to get into an intestine
hassle, Mrs. Christie.

1319
01:13:12,138 --> 01:13:13,973
The malpractice here
is monumental.

1320
01:13:14,057 --> 01:13:17,185
As you can see, Dr. Schaefer's
blood sugar was 23.

1321
01:13:17,268 --> 01:13:19,187
Now, no glucose solution
is going to do that.

1322
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:20,980
The only thing
that possibly could do it

1323
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,691
is at least 50 units
of Insulin, probably more.

1324
01:13:23,775 --> 01:13:26,152
Our only presumption is one
of the 2 nurses on that floor

1325
01:13:26,236 --> 01:13:28,696
shot 50 units of Insulin
into Schaefer's bloodstream.

1326
01:13:28,780 --> 01:13:30,281
Either by injection or I.V.,

1327
01:13:30,365 --> 01:13:31,491
although how
in god's name,

1328
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,159
A thing like that...

1329
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:35,161
I'm very sorry, doctor.
May I use your phone?

1330
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:36,413
Certainly.

1331
01:13:38,373 --> 01:13:39,416
Yes.

1332
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:41,709
Doctor, did you ask the
head nurse from 8th floor

1333
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:43,545
to let you know when
a miss Drummond got here?

1334
01:13:43,628 --> 01:13:44,671
Yes.

1335
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:45,755
Well, she just got there.

1336
01:13:45,839 --> 01:13:47,715
I better get down there directly.

1337
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:49,259
Have you called
the O.O.D.?

1338
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,010
Oh, you better call
Dr. Gilley.

1339
01:13:51,094 --> 01:13:52,720
And you better call
Mr. Sloan.

1340
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:55,140
Yes, I...I'll be right down.

1341
01:13:55,932 --> 01:13:57,308
I'm very sorry, doctor.

1342
01:13:57,392 --> 01:13:59,519
There's a very nasty one
in the O.R.

1343
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,439
They've just operated
on the wrong patient.

1344
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:09,112
Well, I don't understand.
Is she back in her room?

1345
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,030
When did she get
back in her room?

1346
01:14:11,114 --> 01:14:12,657
Who brought her back?

1347
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:14,200
She's back in her room.

1348
01:14:14,284 --> 01:14:15,285
Who?

1349
01:14:15,368 --> 01:14:16,411
Mrs. Mangafranni,

1350
01:14:16,494 --> 01:14:18,746
the woman who was supposed
to have been operated on.

1351
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:21,207
Hey, are they still
working on that woman in 3?

1352
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:22,333
Yeah.

1353
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:25,086
I'm sorry, Mrs. fried,
could you say that again?

1354
01:14:26,045 --> 01:14:28,298
Well, nobody in this office
sent her back up.

1355
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,966
Dr. Donovan.

1356
01:14:30,049 --> 01:14:33,136
All right, Mrs. fried.
I'll have to call you back.

1357
01:14:35,263 --> 01:14:38,475
Did any of you take
a woman patient named Mangafranni

1358
01:14:38,558 --> 01:14:41,853
out of the holding room,
back up to Holly 5, around 10:00?

1359
01:14:42,312 --> 01:14:43,438
What happened?

1360
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,106
I don't know
what happened.

1361
01:14:45,190 --> 01:14:47,108
A patient
named Mangafranni

1362
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,902
was scheduled to have
a hysterectomy

1363
01:14:48,985 --> 01:14:50,820
at 10:00., Dr. Mallory.

1364
01:14:50,904 --> 01:14:53,031
I talked to Sylvia,
in the holding room,

1365
01:14:53,156 --> 01:14:55,325
who admitted her,
so she was here.

1366
01:14:55,408 --> 01:14:59,162
And now I just spoke to, uh,
Mrs. fried on Holly 5

1367
01:14:59,496 --> 01:15:01,998
and she says an orderly
brought Mrs. Mangafranni

1368
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,417
back to her room
about 20 minutes ago.

1369
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:07,420
And now Mrs. Mangafranni
is in her room, sleeping.

1370
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:09,464
Well, who's the woman
in the operating room?

1371
01:15:09,547 --> 01:15:10,590
I don't know.

1372
01:15:10,673 --> 01:15:11,758
Is she dead?

1373
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,802
Well, they had to open her up,
and that's not good.

1374
01:15:18,515 --> 01:15:20,350
I better get
Mr. Mead.

1375
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:23,895
Now, we can rectify
the injustices

1376
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,648
of the world tomorrow,
but right now,

1377
01:15:26,731 --> 01:15:30,276
could we get those people
out of those buildings?

1378
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:34,197
Will you please listen to me?
Will you shut up?

1379
01:15:35,532 --> 01:15:38,368
Will you please shut up
and listen to me?

1380
01:15:38,535 --> 01:15:40,537
Now let's call
a halt to this

1381
01:15:40,620 --> 01:15:43,289
participatory democracy

1382
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:46,209
and address ourselves
to the immediate problem!

1383
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:47,502
How long ago
did this happen?

1384
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:48,628
About half an hour.

1385
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:50,213
- Called the medical examiner?
- Not yet.

1386
01:15:50,296 --> 01:15:53,716
You'd better do that now. You better call
the precinct station house as well.

1387
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,177
Jesus. H.

1388
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:57,804
Good morning.

1389
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,055
Good morning,
doctor.

1390
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:00,890
Well, this is really
something, isn't it?

1391
01:16:00,974 --> 01:16:03,643
I thought she looked a little different
when they brought her in.

1392
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:05,144
I said to one of the nurses,

1393
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:07,230
"she looks younger
without her dentures."

1394
01:16:07,313 --> 01:16:09,440
I had only talked to her
half an hour before.

1395
01:16:09,524 --> 01:16:12,277
Does anyone know who she is?
What's her chart say?

1396
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:13,987
Her chart says
"Mangafranni",

1397
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:16,030
her bracelet says
"Mangafranni."

1398
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:19,576
The only thing that isn't
Mangafranni is the woman.

1399
01:16:19,742 --> 01:16:22,245
Jesus H. Christ!

1400
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,292
I've been chopping out
3 uteruses a day for 30 years,

1401
01:16:27,375 --> 01:16:29,877
and is it too much to expect
for you people to bring in

1402
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:33,339
the right goddamn
Jesus Christ uterus?

1403
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:36,342
I had just been talking to her
in the holding room.

1404
01:16:36,426 --> 01:16:38,928
She was perfectly fine.
A little drowsy.

1405
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:41,222
I thought it was funny
that when they brought her in,

1406
01:16:41,306 --> 01:16:42,974
she was out cold.

1407
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,143
Jesus. H. Christ.

1408
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:47,687
Well, we're just gonna have
to stay here till Mr. Mead

1409
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,981
or someone from
the O.O.D. Comes back.

1410
01:16:50,064 --> 01:16:52,233
Yeah, well, I'm not taking
the rap for this.

1411
01:16:52,317 --> 01:16:54,402
I've already got one
malpractice suit pending

1412
01:16:54,485 --> 01:16:56,362
and I'm not taking
the rap for this one.

1413
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,037
You're not leaving.

1414
01:17:05,038 --> 01:17:07,790
I love you, and I'm not
gonna let you go.

1415
01:17:07,915 --> 01:17:10,543
Come on, now, let's start
putting your father's things back.

1416
01:17:10,627 --> 01:17:12,337
He's staying here.

1417
01:17:12,587 --> 01:17:14,213
I'll find you
an apartment somewhere.

1418
01:17:14,297 --> 01:17:16,424
I'm staying in
a filthy little hotel room,

1419
01:17:16,507 --> 01:17:17,634
we can't use that.

1420
01:17:17,717 --> 01:17:20,136
I can't make it
up here, herb. I'll crack up.

1421
01:17:20,219 --> 01:17:23,306
I can retain my sanity
only in a simple society.

1422
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:25,767
Barbara, you can't
really expect me

1423
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,394
to live in a grass shack
and hunt jackrabbit for dinner.

1424
01:17:28,478 --> 01:17:29,896
Be sensible,
for god's sake.

1425
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:31,314
I am being sensible.

1426
01:17:31,397 --> 01:17:33,608
What is it you're so afraid
of leaving here?

1427
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:36,069
Your plastic home?
Your conditioned air?

1428
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,488
Your synthetic clothes?
Your instant food?

1429
01:17:38,571 --> 01:17:41,407
I'm offering you
green silence, and solitude.

1430
01:17:41,491 --> 01:17:43,618
The natural order
of things.

1431
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:45,703
Mostly, I'm offering me.

1432
01:17:45,995 --> 01:17:47,664
I think
we're beautiful, herb.

1433
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:52,001
You make it sound
almost plausible.

1434
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,379
I don't know
why you even hesitate.

1435
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,631
What's holding you here?

1436
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:58,466
Is it your wife?

1437
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:00,843
No.

1438
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:02,762
That's all over.

1439
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:05,890
I suppose if I'm married to
anything, it's this hospital.

1440
01:18:05,973 --> 01:18:07,684
It's been my whole life.

1441
01:18:07,975 --> 01:18:10,687
I just can't walk out on it
as though it never mattered.

1442
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:12,772
I'm, uh, middle class.

1443
01:18:12,855 --> 01:18:16,275
And among us middle class,
love doesn't triumph over all,

1444
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:18,236
responsibility does.

1445
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,697
Herb, don't ask me
to stay up here with you,

1446
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,740
because I love you,
and I will.

1447
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,992
And we'll both
be destroyed.

1448
01:18:28,579 --> 01:18:31,708
I have the bill
here to pay, yet.

1449
01:18:32,458 --> 01:18:34,210
I'll come with you.

1450
01:18:36,379 --> 01:18:37,422
Herb,

1451
01:18:37,505 --> 01:18:40,883
listen, Joe Lagerman says you wanted
to know the name of that dialysis nurse?

1452
01:18:40,967 --> 01:18:41,968
What dialysis nurse?

1453
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:45,138
The one who...the one who
goofed on your patient, Drummond.

1454
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,515
Well, her name is
Teresa Campanella.

1455
01:18:47,598 --> 01:18:49,142
You're not
gonna believe this, herb.

1456
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:52,437
She died on the operating table
of O.R. 3 about an hour ago.

1457
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,813
What're you talking about?

1458
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:55,940
Well, you heard about
the screw up in O.R. 3.

1459
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:57,024
You mean,
she was the one?

1460
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,735
That's the one.
I just identified her.

1461
01:18:58,818 --> 01:18:59,819
What is going on
around here?

1462
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:01,988
Every time I try to find
somebody in this hospital,

1463
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:04,115
they either died of a heart attack
in an emergency,

1464
01:19:04,198 --> 01:19:05,825
or anesthesia shock
in an operating room.

1465
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,535
Listen, I just came
from the O.R.

1466
01:19:07,618 --> 01:19:09,370
They're trying to find
a Dr. Schaefer.

1467
01:19:09,454 --> 01:19:11,497
Don't you have a kid named
Schaefer in your service?

1468
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:14,167
I had a Schaeffer. He died yesterday
of an overdose of Insulin.

1469
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,501
What do they want
Schaeffer for?

1470
01:19:15,585 --> 01:19:17,962
Well, the holding room nurse
says there's a Dr. Schaefer

1471
01:19:18,045 --> 01:19:19,547
hanging around
the holding room.

1472
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,382
Wouldn't have been
your Schaefer anyway.

1473
01:19:21,466 --> 01:19:23,676
Nurse says it was
senior staff, middle-aged man.

1474
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,012
There's no senior staff
named Schaefer in this hospital.

1475
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:28,097
I told them that,
I said, "I don't know

1476
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:30,308
any senior staff
around here named Schaefer."

1477
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:32,518
They've got detectives
down there. Everything.

1478
01:19:32,602 --> 01:19:33,811
A whole big
investigation.

1479
01:19:33,895 --> 01:19:35,688
How'd the nurse know
his name was Schaefer?

1480
01:19:35,772 --> 01:19:37,273
Uh, his nameplate.

1481
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:42,755
I am the fool for Christ,

1482
01:20:42,839 --> 01:20:44,674
and paraclete of caborca.

1483
01:20:45,967 --> 01:20:47,844
Oh, for heaven's sakes, dad.

1484
01:20:48,261 --> 01:20:49,971
What the hell's going on?

1485
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:51,973
We all thought
you were at death's door.

1486
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,599
What are you doing
out of bed?

1487
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:54,892
What happened?

1488
01:20:54,976 --> 01:20:58,437
What's he going at you for?
Did he...did he say anything?

1489
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,940
As a matter of fact,

1490
01:21:01,023 --> 01:21:03,192
he said, "I am the fool
for Christ

1491
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:05,278
and the paraclete
of caborca."

1492
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:08,573
You better shut that door, because if
he tells everybody who walks in here

1493
01:21:08,656 --> 01:21:11,242
that he's the fool for Christ
and the paraclete of caborca,

1494
01:21:11,325 --> 01:21:12,577
they're gonna put us
all away.

1495
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:14,453
He's already killed
2 doctors and a nurse.

1496
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:15,997
I am the wrath
of the lamb,

1497
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:17,790
and the angel
of the bottomless pit.

1498
01:21:17,874 --> 01:21:19,917
What do you mean he's killed
2 doctors and a nurse?

1499
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:22,712
I mean, he's killed
2 doctors and a nurse.

1500
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,172
He just tried to kill me.

1501
01:21:25,256 --> 01:21:27,592
He has something
against doctors.

1502
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:30,803
Somehow, he got a hold
of some Insulin and put it

1503
01:21:30,887 --> 01:21:33,055
in Dr. Schaefer's
intravenous solution.

1504
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:36,183
And somehow, he got Dr. Ives
to die of a heart attack

1505
01:21:36,267 --> 01:21:38,269
in the middle
of the emergency room.

1506
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,646
And somehow, he got
a dialysis nurse, named Campanella

1507
01:21:40,730 --> 01:21:43,482
to die of anesthesia shock
on an operating table.

1508
01:21:43,566 --> 01:21:45,443
He's been running
all over the hospital,

1509
01:21:45,526 --> 01:21:47,820
dressed up in
Dr. Schaefer's uniform.

1510
01:21:47,904 --> 01:21:49,906
Right now, they're looking
all over the place

1511
01:21:49,989 --> 01:21:51,908
for the mysterious
Dr. Schaefer.

1512
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:53,409
This maybe incredible
to us both,

1513
01:21:53,492 --> 01:21:54,702
but you can see for yourself,

1514
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:56,746
your father's not the helpless comatose
we thought.

1515
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,915
Well, don't look at me
like I'm the one who's crazy.

1516
01:21:58,998 --> 01:22:00,374
Ask your crazy father.

1517
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:03,252
I was merely
an instrument of god.

1518
01:22:03,336 --> 01:22:04,837
I killed no one.

1519
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,882
They all 3 died
by their own hands.

1520
01:22:08,382 --> 01:22:11,260
Ritual victims
of their own institutions,

1521
01:22:11,761 --> 01:22:13,429
murdered by irony.

1522
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,432
"An eye for an eye."

1523
01:22:18,059 --> 01:22:19,852
Biblical retribution.

1524
01:22:20,770 --> 01:22:23,773
Schaefer was first, because
you see, he killed god.

1525
01:22:24,774 --> 01:22:27,610
God was admitted to this
hospital last Monday

1526
01:22:27,735 --> 01:22:29,528
under the name of Guernsey.

1527
01:22:30,071 --> 01:22:32,907
I was instantly aware
of a divine presence.

1528
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:35,534
I was convinced
this porcelain old man

1529
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:37,453
was in fact an angel
of the lord,

1530
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:39,956
perhaps even Christ himself.

1531
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,751
Our savior was, it seems,
suffering from emphysema.

1532
01:22:44,543 --> 01:22:47,713
He was relentlessly subjected
to the benefits of modern medicine

1533
01:22:47,797 --> 01:22:50,049
and died at 7:30
that evening.

1534
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:53,844
A few hours later, he appeared
to me in a revelation.

1535
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:57,014
Rise up, Drummond.

1536
01:22:58,307 --> 01:23:01,477
You are dead,
now you are restored.

1537
01:23:02,979 --> 01:23:06,524
Those who killed you,
and those who killed me

1538
01:23:06,607 --> 01:23:08,567
will die in our place.

1539
01:23:10,695 --> 01:23:13,322
You are the paraclete
of caborca.

1540
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,492
The wrath of the lamb.

1541
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:19,662
The angel

1542
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:23,416
of the bottomless pit.

1543
01:23:27,420 --> 01:23:28,546
Well,

1544
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:31,090
not quite the
burning bush, perhaps,

1545
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:33,300
but prodigal enough for me.

1546
01:23:33,718 --> 01:23:37,430
I was to avenge the death of god,
and my own brutalization.

1547
01:23:37,513 --> 01:23:41,142
I was to kill doctors Schaefer,
Ives, and Welbeck,

1548
01:23:41,434 --> 01:23:43,894
and the dialysis nurse,
miss Campanella,

1549
01:23:43,978 --> 01:23:46,397
whose negligence
caused my coma.

1550
01:23:46,605 --> 01:23:48,566
I awaited
a further sign from god,

1551
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:50,693
which was given
to me later that evening.

1552
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:54,113
Dr. Schaefer, it seems, had
arranged an assignation

1553
01:23:54,196 --> 01:23:57,366
with a girl from the hematology lab,
named Sheila.

1554
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,412
Boy, I sure hope
nobody walks in.

1555
01:24:05,041 --> 01:24:06,125
What about him?

1556
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:07,376
He's zonked out.

1557
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:09,295
So what's new?

1558
01:24:09,420 --> 01:24:10,546
Nothing.

1559
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:18,846
What's this?

1560
01:24:18,929 --> 01:24:19,972
Oh, it's my Insulin.

1561
01:24:20,056 --> 01:24:21,474
I forgot
to put it back.

1562
01:24:21,557 --> 01:24:22,641
Insulin?

1563
01:24:22,725 --> 01:24:25,561
What's the Insulin for?
I didn't know you were a diabetic.

1564
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:28,064
It ain't contagious,
don't worry.

1565
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:30,191
So, you took the Insulin

1566
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,318
from Dr. Schaefer's pocket
and put it in the I.V.

1567
01:24:32,401 --> 01:24:33,402
yes.

1568
01:24:33,611 --> 01:24:35,404
And then a nurse came,

1569
01:24:35,488 --> 01:24:38,365
and plugged the iv jar
into...into Schaefer.

1570
01:24:39,909 --> 01:24:42,828
God clearly intended
a measure of irony here.

1571
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:46,457
The hospital was to do
all the killing for me.

1572
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,793
All I need do is
arrange for the doctors

1573
01:24:48,918 --> 01:24:51,253
to become patients
in their own hospital.

1574
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:56,759
Accordingly the next morning,
I pinched some digoxin from the pharmacy,

1575
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,096
and a sandbag
from a utility cart,

1576
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,557
and found my way
to Dr. Ives' laboratory.

1577
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:07,520
I crushed him
with the sandbag

1578
01:25:08,229 --> 01:25:11,065
and gave him a massive shot
of the digoxin.

1579
01:25:11,607 --> 01:25:15,319
This, you see, brought on an instant
condition of cardiac arrhythmia.

1580
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:18,114
I waited for him
to come to, and

1581
01:25:19,281 --> 01:25:22,118
then I brought him down
to the emergency room.

1582
01:25:22,201 --> 01:25:24,787
He had, at that time,
perhaps an hour to live.

1583
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,831
Prompt treatment
would've saved his life.

1584
01:25:26,914 --> 01:25:30,292
He was suddenly taken ill. I thought
I'd better get him over here right away.

1585
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:33,587
As a staff doctor,
he was seen without preliminaries.

1586
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:36,882
His vital signs were taken.
An electrocardiogram

1587
01:25:36,966 --> 01:25:40,761
which revealed occasional
ventricular premature contractions.

1588
01:25:41,262 --> 01:25:44,640
An intern took his history,
and then he was

1589
01:25:44,807 --> 01:25:46,934
promptly, simply...

1590
01:25:47,977 --> 01:25:49,687
Forgotten to death.

1591
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:52,106
Simply mislaid.

1592
01:25:52,940 --> 01:25:55,276
Mislaid among
the broken wrists,

1593
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:58,529
the chest pains,
the scalp lacerations,

1594
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:02,241
the man whose fingers
were crushed in a taxi door,

1595
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:06,745
the infant with a skin rash,
the child swiped by a car,

1596
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:09,415
the old lady
mugged in the subway,

1597
01:26:09,498 --> 01:26:11,500
the derelict
beaten by sailors,

1598
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:15,921
the teenage suicide,
the paranoids,

1599
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:19,800
drunks, asthmatics, the rapes,
the septic abortions,

1600
01:26:19,884 --> 01:26:21,635
the overdosed addicts,

1601
01:26:21,719 --> 01:26:24,054
the fractures,
infarcts, hemorrhages,

1602
01:26:24,180 --> 01:26:26,557
concussions,
boils, abrasions,

1603
01:26:26,807 --> 01:26:29,685
the colonic cancers,
the cardiac arrests,

1604
01:26:30,352 --> 01:26:34,190
the whole wounded
madhouse of our times.

1605
01:26:41,614 --> 01:26:45,618
Who's number 7680202-s?

1606
01:26:45,993 --> 01:26:48,662
Is there anybody here
who is that number?

1607
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:51,707
Who's number 7680202...

1608
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:53,292
In this way, you see,

1609
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:57,379
was it revealed to me
the manner of nurse Campanella's death.

1610
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:01,008
She was to die
of the great American plague:

1611
01:27:01,675 --> 01:27:03,385
Vestigial identity.

1612
01:27:04,345 --> 01:27:08,307
So, last night, I crushed miss Campanella
with a sandbag,

1613
01:27:09,266 --> 01:27:12,728
sedated her with Thorazine,
shaved her, prepped her,

1614
01:27:13,312 --> 01:27:16,649
and parked her in a corridor of the X-ray
department for 5 hours.

1615
01:27:16,732 --> 01:27:17,900
Why X-ray?

1616
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,193
Well, at X-ray,

1617
01:27:19,276 --> 01:27:23,405
a sedated body lying around unattended
for 5 hours wouldn't seem unusual.

1618
01:27:23,489 --> 01:27:24,490
Of course.

1619
01:27:24,573 --> 01:27:26,909
Her operation,
that is to say,

1620
01:27:27,243 --> 01:27:31,747
Mrs. Mangafranni's operation,
was not scheduled till 9:30.

1621
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:35,334
So at 9:15 this morning,
I rang for my nurse.

1622
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:36,835
Rang for your nurse?

1623
01:27:36,919 --> 01:27:39,922
To insure one full hour
of uninterrupted privacy.

1624
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:41,257
Of course.

1625
01:27:41,340 --> 01:27:46,095
I got up, wheeled miss Campanella
off to the operating rooms,

1626
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:50,599
I exchanged Mrs. Mangafranni's bed
with hers.

1627
01:27:51,267 --> 01:27:54,770
I transferred the charts
and identity bracelets.

1628
01:27:55,229 --> 01:27:57,940
She died officially
of anesthesia shock.

1629
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:03,279
In point of fact, she died because she was
wearing another woman's identity.

1630
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:05,030
God, what do we do now?

1631
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:08,993
Let me take him
back to Mexico, herb.

1632
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,537
It's a simple world there.
He functions there.

1633
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,788
If you turn him in,

1634
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:16,750
they'll just cage him in the Rockland
state hospital for the criminally insane.

1635
01:28:16,834 --> 01:28:18,168
Let me take him back.

1636
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:20,379
Are you kidding?

1637
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:24,049
We'll both take him.
I'm going with you.

1638
01:28:24,842 --> 01:28:25,884
Let's get him dressed.

1639
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:29,138
We're getting out of here before
the police put us all in Rockland state.

1640
01:28:29,221 --> 01:28:31,181
I haven't finished my work here.

1641
01:28:31,265 --> 01:28:33,267
I have this
Welbeck to dispose of.

1642
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:36,353
I'm the angel
of the bottomless pit,

1643
01:28:36,603 --> 01:28:38,439
and the wrath of the lamb.

1644
01:28:39,732 --> 01:28:40,858
God!

1645
01:28:43,277 --> 01:28:45,571
Oh, dear, he's having
another revelation.

1646
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:47,948
Look, um,

1647
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:50,576
that ambulance
must be there by now.

1648
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:52,161
You go and get 'em.

1649
01:28:52,328 --> 01:28:54,580
I'll, uh, give him a shot of something
to knock him out.

1650
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:56,874
We'll take him to the airport
in the ambulance.

1651
01:29:05,716 --> 01:29:07,843
You're hallucinating again.

1652
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:16,435
Uh...

1653
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:21,607
Dr. Stanford, Dr. Robert...

1654
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:23,484
Powell never showed up.

1655
01:29:23,567 --> 01:29:26,278
I'm short-staffed as hell.
It's just me and Alice.

1656
01:29:26,362 --> 01:29:29,615
It's like a Sunday.
Nobody's here.

1657
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:30,991
I'll be in
with the bleeder.

1658
01:29:31,075 --> 01:29:32,785
Yeah, you gotta
send me somebody.

1659
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,578
Well, oh, yeah.

1660
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,246
We'll be in 806.

1661
01:29:38,749 --> 01:29:39,750
Then what did she say?

1662
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:42,920
I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient
on this floor named Drummond.

1663
01:29:43,003 --> 01:29:44,755
I'd like to see his chart.

1664
01:29:45,381 --> 01:29:48,300
Dr. Bock, can I have a few minutes
of your time, sir?

1665
01:29:48,384 --> 01:29:52,554
Dr. Gilley tells me you are the one who
initiated these proceedings against me.

1666
01:29:52,638 --> 01:29:53,680
I'm busy, Welbeck.

1667
01:29:53,764 --> 01:29:56,308
I'd like to know what is it you have
against me, doctor.

1668
01:29:58,060 --> 01:30:00,354
8 days ago,
you showed up half-stoned

1669
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:01,855
for a simple nephrectomy,

1670
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:05,025
botched it, put the patient in failure,
and damn near killed him.

1671
01:30:05,109 --> 01:30:07,069
Then, pausing only
to send in your bill,

1672
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:08,695
you flew off
on the wings of man

1673
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:11,031
to an island
of sun in Montego Bay.

1674
01:30:11,115 --> 01:30:12,825
This is the 3rd time
in 2 years

1675
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:14,618
we've had to patch up
your patients.

1676
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,245
The other 2 died.

1677
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:19,331
You're greedy, unfeeling,
inept, indifferent,

1678
01:30:19,498 --> 01:30:22,251
self-inflating,
and unconscionably profitable.

1679
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,461
Aside from that,
I have nothing against you.

1680
01:30:24,545 --> 01:30:28,090
I'm sure you play a hell of a game
of golf. What else do you want to know?

1681
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:30,300
How much do you
make a year, Bock?

1682
01:30:30,551 --> 01:30:33,554
For a guy who makes
a lousy 40-50 grand...

1683
01:30:41,103 --> 01:30:43,647
This is Dr. Welbeck.
Were you paging me?

1684
01:30:44,148 --> 01:30:47,109
Yes, Arthur, I understand you've been
trying to reach me all morning.

1685
01:30:47,568 --> 01:30:49,820
I tell you, Milton, he pulls out the wires
and the tubes,

1686
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:52,531
he gets up and he puts on
a doctor's uniform and he goes out,

1687
01:30:52,614 --> 01:30:54,074
and he murders doctors.

1688
01:30:54,158 --> 01:30:56,785
He just went out
10 seconds before you came in here.

1689
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:59,329
I'll tell you something else
about this crazy place.

1690
01:30:59,413 --> 01:31:02,249
There was a naked Indian in here last
night doing a war dance.

1691
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:04,793
That's the kind of crazy place
you're running here, Milton.

1692
01:31:04,877 --> 01:31:06,462
You gotta get me
out of here, Milton.

1693
01:31:06,545 --> 01:31:08,046
Milton, this is
a crazy place.

1694
01:31:08,130 --> 01:31:09,381
Milton, listen to me,
listen.

1695
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:11,675
I wake up last night
and there was an Indian in here,

1696
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,218
a naked Indian!

1697
01:31:13,302 --> 01:31:14,845
What kind of a hospital
is this?

1698
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:16,430
This is Mr. Mead.
Are you paging me?

1699
01:31:16,513 --> 01:31:19,349
A couple of hours later, the guy in that
bed there is getting out.

1700
01:31:19,433 --> 01:31:21,602
Are the police still in the building?
Get them up here.

1701
01:31:21,685 --> 01:31:23,479
All day long
he lays there like he's dead.

1702
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:26,815
In the middle of the night, he gets out
of bed! Thought I was going crazy!

1703
01:31:26,899 --> 01:31:29,610
You know what he says to me? He says,
"you're hallucinating."

1704
01:31:29,735 --> 01:31:32,696
I just... listen, I saw a naked Indian,
now I'm seeing a ghost.

1705
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,781
I figure he's right,
I'm hallucinating, right?

1706
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,033
I'll be down directly.

1707
01:31:36,116 --> 01:31:37,367
It never rains,
but it pours.

1708
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:39,703
A fire just broke out
in one of the condemned buildings.

1709
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:42,372
The squatters came out.
The police tried to arrest them.

1710
01:31:42,456 --> 01:31:44,333
Now the situation has
erupted into a riot.

1711
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,501
Milton...

1712
01:31:45,584 --> 01:31:47,419
I'm sure you're wondering
what this is about, herb.

1713
01:31:47,503 --> 01:31:49,004
You're not gonna leave
me alone in here.

1714
01:31:49,087 --> 01:31:50,464
Mr. Hitchcock will
stay with you.

1715
01:31:50,547 --> 01:31:51,757
Better call the cops, Tom.

1716
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,008
Milton, Milton, Milton!

1717
01:31:53,717 --> 01:31:55,093
I haven't time now.

1718
01:31:55,177 --> 01:31:58,931
I'm not gonna try to tell you this crazy
story my brother just told me.

1719
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:01,058
I'll fill you in on it
at lunch sometime.

1720
01:32:01,141 --> 01:32:02,184
Hold it!

1721
01:32:02,351 --> 01:32:03,435
The ambulance is here.

1722
01:32:03,519 --> 01:32:06,313
But your father isn't.
Disappeared.

1723
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:09,441
He put on Schaefer's uniform,
and took off to do god's work,

1724
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:11,568
presumably the murder
of Dr. Welbeck.

1725
01:32:11,652 --> 01:32:13,570
The guy on the phone
over there is Dr. Welbeck.

1726
01:32:13,654 --> 01:32:16,031
Oh, my god, Arthur,
what are you talking about?

1727
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,867
On top of everything else,
the other patient in your father's room

1728
01:32:18,951 --> 01:32:20,619
just overheard
the whole confession

1729
01:32:20,702 --> 01:32:23,664
and he told the chief administrator.
They're sending for the cops.

1730
01:32:23,747 --> 01:32:26,041
Oh, my god, Arthur.
Well, who held title?

1731
01:32:28,043 --> 01:32:30,754
Do the underwriters
know about this yet?

1732
01:32:31,547 --> 01:32:33,590
Oh, my god, Arthur,
what are you waiting for?

1733
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:35,842
Arrest the son of a bitch.
Turn him in.

1734
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:37,970
Oh, my god! When?

1735
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:41,765
Well, of course, Arthur,
and call me right back.

1736
01:32:41,848 --> 01:32:44,309
I'm at the Holly pavilion,
8th floor. Hurry, please.

1737
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:45,561
Are you all right,
Welbeck?

1738
01:32:45,727 --> 01:32:46,895
Am I all right?

1739
01:32:47,020 --> 01:32:50,107
That son of a bitch
is trying to wipe me out. My partner.

1740
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:52,859
The eminent orthopedic surgeon,
Dr. Noel hogan

1741
01:32:52,943 --> 01:32:55,571
is a miserable thief,
and he's trying to wipe me out.

1742
01:32:56,280 --> 01:32:57,447
Mr. Drummond's chart.

1743
01:32:57,531 --> 01:32:58,865
What?
Oh, what room is it?

1744
01:32:58,949 --> 01:32:59,950
806.

1745
01:33:00,033 --> 01:33:03,120
I'm expecting a phone call. Put it
straight through to me in that room.

1746
01:33:04,705 --> 01:33:06,999
The son of a bitch
has been draining the company

1747
01:33:07,082 --> 01:33:09,751
with phony purchase orders
on another company,

1748
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:13,630
of which, it now turns out,
his wife is the principal stockholder.

1749
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,299
Transparent fraud.

1750
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,217
I'll send him up
for 20 years.

1751
01:33:18,760 --> 01:33:21,930
Well, Drummond, you don't seem
that much the worse for wear.

1752
01:33:22,472 --> 01:33:25,684
Would you mind using some other phone?
I'm expecting an important call.

1753
01:33:25,767 --> 01:33:26,810
Who is this guy?

1754
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,478
I'll be at the nurses' desk,
sergeant.

1755
01:33:28,562 --> 01:33:29,896
You've got a bit
of a fever, Drummond,

1756
01:33:29,980 --> 01:33:31,565
but you're coming along
very well.

1757
01:33:31,648 --> 01:33:33,567
I'm not Drummond!
Drummond's the other bed.

1758
01:33:34,735 --> 01:33:35,861
That's mine.

1759
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:38,530
Hello, it's Welbeck here.
Yes, Arthur, go ahead.

1760
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:39,990
I'm getting out
of this nuthouse.

1761
01:33:40,073 --> 01:33:41,450
Just take it easy, Mr. Mead.

1762
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,702
I came in here to get
a lousy polyp cut out.

1763
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:47,497
My god! What do you mean?
How many transactions were there?

1764
01:33:48,457 --> 01:33:51,293
But, Arthur, I...I borrowed
against that stock.

1765
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:54,046
I'm a sick man.
I'm supposed to have peace and quiet!

1766
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:56,131
What do you mean,
Brazil?

1767
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:01,345
I talked to hogan's office yesterday,
and they just told

1768
01:34:02,137 --> 01:34:03,639
I'm wiped out.

1769
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:06,850
The S.E.C has suspended
trading in my stock.

1770
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:11,938
Welbeck.

1771
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,239
Cardiac arrest. Holly 8.

1772
01:34:22,491 --> 01:34:24,534
We have an emergency here.

1773
01:34:24,826 --> 01:34:26,703
C.A.C., Holly 8.

1774
01:34:26,787 --> 01:34:28,622
Please clear all corridors.

1775
01:34:31,333 --> 01:34:33,502
C.A.C on Holly 8,

1776
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:35,754
please clear all corridors.

1777
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:37,214
Breathe him.

1778
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:42,761
Where's Chandler?

1779
01:34:42,844 --> 01:34:43,929
He went to lunch.

1780
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,764
Get that bed out of here.

1781
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,268
Give me an ambu-bag
and an airway.

1782
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:52,604
What's been happening?

1783
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:11,581
- In here?
- Yeah.

1784
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,250
Dr. Robert Stanford.

1785
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,376
Who is it?

1786
01:35:14,459 --> 01:35:16,378
One of the patients
had a cardiac arrest.

1787
01:35:17,421 --> 01:35:19,214
Total cardiac arrest.

1788
01:35:19,297 --> 01:35:22,008
Dr. Rickie.

1789
01:35:22,426 --> 01:35:24,219
Dr. Lionel Rickie.

1790
01:35:24,886 --> 01:35:26,096
How long has he
been like this?

1791
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:27,305
A minute old.

1792
01:35:27,389 --> 01:35:29,307
No pulse, no heartbeat, no respiration.

1793
01:35:29,391 --> 01:35:30,434
I'll take over.

1794
01:35:30,517 --> 01:35:31,768
We have another
emergency in 823.

1795
01:35:31,852 --> 01:35:33,228
Endotracheal tube.

1796
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:34,896
Listen,
was it Drummond?

1797
01:35:35,021 --> 01:35:36,481
Who else
would it be?

1798
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,196
All right,
who is this patient?

1799
01:35:43,280 --> 01:35:45,157
What's the story
on this patient?

1800
01:35:45,949 --> 01:35:49,244
This his chart, Dr. Bock?
What's his name? Drummond?

1801
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:53,415
Yes, his name is Drummond.
That's his chart.

1802
01:35:54,249 --> 01:35:55,667
Christ.
The poor son of a bitch

1803
01:35:55,751 --> 01:35:57,502
just had
a nephrectomy a week ago.

1804
01:36:06,303 --> 01:36:07,971
Hook him up to the monitor.

1805
01:36:08,555 --> 01:36:10,182
Stop the massage.

1806
01:36:15,312 --> 01:36:17,647
Ventricular fibrillation.
Get me the paddles.

1807
01:36:17,731 --> 01:36:19,816
Push another amp of bicarb.

1808
01:36:20,358 --> 01:36:21,902
Set it for 200.

1809
01:36:24,654 --> 01:36:25,781
Set, 200.

1810
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:28,784
Everybody back away. 1, 2, 3.

1811
01:36:30,243 --> 01:36:33,288
Didn't convert.
He's still fibrillating.

1812
01:36:33,789 --> 01:36:35,373
Let's go to 400.

1813
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:38,960
Everybody back.

1814
01:36:39,127 --> 01:36:40,128
Set, 400.

1815
01:36:40,462 --> 01:36:41,838
1, 2, 3.

1816
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:45,008
That didn't work, either.
Let me have

1817
01:36:45,091 --> 01:36:47,302
a cc of adrenalin,
and an intercardiac needle.

1818
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:53,642
Stop the massage.

1819
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:56,978
It's ventricular fibrillation.
Push another amp of bicarb.

1820
01:37:01,066 --> 01:37:02,317
200.

1821
01:37:05,237 --> 01:37:06,613
Set, 200.

1822
01:37:14,329 --> 01:37:15,664
Is he dead?

1823
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:18,875
They can't get him out of fib.
I don't think he'll make it.

1824
01:37:18,959 --> 01:37:20,293
Thank god.

1825
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,337
Well,

1826
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,589
that should close
the case, sergeant.

1827
01:37:27,384 --> 01:37:30,220
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
We just want the director.

1828
01:37:47,362 --> 01:37:48,822
Now I've had it up to here.

1829
01:37:48,905 --> 01:37:51,825
I am not dealing with
this kind of cheap...

1830
01:37:51,908 --> 01:37:53,660
now, look, man,

1831
01:37:54,077 --> 01:37:55,996
we're looking
for a hostage!

1832
01:37:56,079 --> 01:37:57,455
14 people
got arrested for...

1833
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:59,040
where's the
damn T.V. Camera?

1834
01:37:59,124 --> 01:38:01,167
Would you be cool, man?

1835
01:38:01,251 --> 01:38:04,629
14 people got arrested for doing nothin'
but living in their homes,

1836
01:38:04,713 --> 01:38:06,089
which you people
threw them out of.

1837
01:38:06,172 --> 01:38:07,465
Right on.

1838
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:09,301
Now we are
gonna arrest you.

1839
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,345
We gonna hold you hostage,
and we ain't letting you go.

1840
01:38:14,806 --> 01:38:18,018
We, the members of the doctors'
liberation committee,

1841
01:38:18,101 --> 01:38:20,353
indict this hospital
for the criminal neglect

1842
01:38:20,478 --> 01:38:22,731
of the community in
which it is situated.

1843
01:38:22,814 --> 01:38:25,984
We demand an immediate dissolution of
the governing and executive boards...

1844
01:38:26,067 --> 01:38:29,070
what are you gonna do
about those 14 ghetto people?

1845
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:33,867
I am not going to do
anything about anything.

1846
01:38:34,034 --> 01:38:35,160
Yes, you are.

1847
01:38:35,243 --> 01:38:38,580
If you want to take over this hospital,
you take it over.

1848
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:39,664
We will!

1849
01:38:39,748 --> 01:38:40,749
You run it!

1850
01:38:40,832 --> 01:38:43,168
I am finished. I quit.

1851
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,504
You run it.
You pay the bills!

1852
01:38:47,005 --> 01:38:48,590
- You fight the city.
- We will.

1853
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:51,343
You fight the state.
You fight the unions.

1854
01:38:51,426 --> 01:38:53,261
You fight the community.

1855
01:38:53,553 --> 01:38:56,514
You think you can do
a better job, you do it.

1856
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:58,725
Now, I am finished!
I quit!

1857
01:38:59,267 --> 01:39:00,810
It's all yours.

1858
01:39:22,791 --> 01:39:26,753
Let those who are in Judea
flee to the mountains!

1859
01:39:27,087 --> 01:39:29,297
The age is closed!

1860
01:39:29,464 --> 01:39:33,802
The season
of the 7th seal is at hand!

1861
01:39:34,135 --> 01:39:37,222
The age is closed.

1862
01:39:37,305 --> 01:39:38,598
The season of...

1863
01:39:38,682 --> 01:39:41,142
Dr. Welbeck is dead.
They thought he was you.

1864
01:39:41,226 --> 01:39:42,435
Yes, I know.

1865
01:39:42,644 --> 01:39:45,772
We must arrange to have his body shipped
to my Apache village,

1866
01:39:45,855 --> 01:39:47,899
where we'll bury him
with full tribal rites.

1867
01:39:47,983 --> 01:39:49,109
We got to hurry.

1868
01:39:49,192 --> 01:39:50,527
In a day or 2,
someone will ask,

1869
01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,529
"whatever
happened to Dr. Welbeck?"

1870
01:39:52,612 --> 01:39:55,615
It'll be assumed he absconded to Brazil
to join his partner,

1871
01:39:55,699 --> 01:39:58,994
the eminent orthopedic surgeon,
Dr. Noel hogan.

1872
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:01,663
Welbeck, too,
was mislaid,

1873
01:40:01,997 --> 01:40:05,041
overlooked,
forgotten to death.

1874
01:40:06,835 --> 01:40:08,336
I'm not going.

1875
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:10,588
The hospital's coming apart.

1876
01:40:10,672 --> 01:40:13,341
I can't walk out on it
when it's coming apart.

1877
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:16,094
Someone has
to be responsible, Barbara.

1878
01:40:17,262 --> 01:40:20,849
Everybody's
hitting the road,

1879
01:40:21,683 --> 01:40:24,185
running away,
running to the hills.

1880
01:40:25,645 --> 01:40:28,523
Someone's got
to be responsible.

1881
01:40:36,364 --> 01:40:39,534
Kennedy airport.
You've got a 2:30 flight to make.

1882
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:58,887
You going back in?

1883
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:00,722
Yep.

1884
01:41:01,681 --> 01:41:04,267
It's like pissing
in the wind, right, herb?
