1
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,943
<i>Einstein was then celebrating, uh,</i>

2
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:02,495
<i>the 70th birthday anniversary,</i>

3
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,824
<i>and there was a colloquium
given for him.</i>

4
00:02:05,917 --> 00:02:08,455
<i>And he said,</i>

5
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:13,461
<i>"God doesn't play dice
with the universe."</i>

6
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,338
No. He-He just plays hide-and-seek.

7
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:20,342
<i>Learn to write screenplays,
television scripts, plays and...</i>

8
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,970
Jesus, they're so full of it,
you know?

9
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,144
You-You can't teach writing.
It's not something you can teach.

10
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,688
You can only expose the students to
good literature and hope it inspires them.

11
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:32,108
The ones that can write can write
when they come to my class;

12
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,685
The others never learn.

13
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,068
You lose patience if the student
isn't Dostoyevsky or Joyce.

14
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,865
- No, that isn't true. That's crazy.
- Sure you do.

15
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,865
But what makes it worth it is that every
now and then you get a gifted pupil.

16
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,289
There's this young girl in my class
who wrote a fabulous short story called

17
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,290
"Oral Sex in the Age of Deconstruction,"
and it's full of insights and romantic...

18
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,417
There they are.

19
00:02:53,507 --> 00:02:55,999
I guarantee Jack is gonna want
to take us for Chinese food again.

20
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:58,631
I think Sally's getting a little tired
of our pasta places.

21
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,212
Hi.
Is it supposed to rain?

22
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,764
- Rain? No. God...
- Hi, Judy.

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,433
Hi. How are you? Can I take your coat?

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,479
I opened some cold white wine.
Do you want some?

25
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,898
- Was it okay on the highway?
- No, they're doing something at 80th.

26
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,941
- Jack, do you want some...
- They're always doing something.

27
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,894
- I'm sick of it.
- You want some white wine?

28
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,945
Every time I go up to your place,
it's murder.

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,615
So, uh, the-
it's the Chinese restaurant, right?

30
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,534
I can't talk you
into the Italian restaurant?

31
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,952
No, no, let's-let's do this.

32
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:27,826
Listen, don't get crazy, you know?

33
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,909
Now, before we go out to dinner,
we want to tell you something.

34
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,710
- I was just about to serve Jack. What?
- Oh, yeah?

35
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:35,880
- Well, do you want to?
- No, no, go ahead.

36
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,253
- What, what?
- Somebody tell us.

37
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,006
Jack and I are splitting up.

38
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:44,589
- Oh, I see. It's just nothing serious, so...
- What?

39
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,802
Gabe, we discussed this for a long, long
time, and we both think it's for the best.

40
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,184
- Okay?
- You are joking, of course? It is a joke.

41
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:55,483
Do me a favor. Don't make a big deal
out of it. Because we're both fine.

42
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,778
- Are you serious?
- No, we are. We're fine. We're fine.

43
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:01,777
- Yeah, no, no. We both... We discussed it.
- It's mutual.

44
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,234
- It's-It's...
- What do you mean?

45
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:07,491
Hey, uh, let's... I got a great idea.
Let's go talk about this at dinner.

46
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,664
- Yes.
- This is gonna turn into a bad thing.

47
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,334
- I'm not going out to dinner.
- Since when has this been decided?

48
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,163
What are we talking about here?
You... She's right.

49
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,963
It's something we've discussed
for a while now.

50
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,335
Don't be worried.

51
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:20,416
- Why?
- There's no hostility.

52
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,800
- Nobody's angry here. We're fine.
- What is the reason?

53
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,507
- Don't turn it into a tragedy.
- It's none of our business.

54
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,435
- Guys. Don't turn this into a tragedy.
- I'm going to get a drink.

55
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,807
'Cause it's a very positive step
for both of us.

56
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,106
How can you get a...
you know, break up?

57
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,980
That's insane.
You're Jack and Sally. You got two kids.

58
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,937
Hey, our kids are grown up, for Christ's
sake, you know? They're in college.

59
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,819
And we don't want to
bore you with the details.

60
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:48,279
I can't get my mind around this.
You guys get along so well.

61
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,614
She's right. I mean,
have you met other people?

62
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,792
- What is the story here?
- Gabe, Gabe, that isn't our business.

63
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,621
- I'm fascinated by this.
- I just feel sick.

64
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,047
Hey, we didn't want
to ruin anything, okay?

65
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,967
We want to see what it's like
to be, to be, you know...

66
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:06,137
- Apart for a while. Don't not support us.
- To be apart, yeah.

67
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:08,089
We've finally gotten the nerve
to do this thing.

68
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:12,302
This is total insanity. You'll be
back together in one week. I just...

69
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,979
She's gonna keep the place in Riverdale,
and I'm looking for a place in town.

70
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:19,855
- Oh, I just feel shattered!
- Oh, come on, Judy.

71
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:23,188
- I do!
- Hey, come on. Let's eat, hmm?

72
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:28,242
What do you mean, "Come on, let's eat"?
"Come on"? I can't eat.

73
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,490
- Well, don't get angry.
- I'm not angry.

74
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,572
- You are angry.
- I'm not angry!

75
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,656
I knew it. I told you.

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,413
You march in here and announce
you're-you're breaking up.

77
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,962
You-You have two kids together!
Why are you doing this?

78
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,882
- Why are you doing this?
- This is not our business.

79
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:45,631
Why isn't it our business?
They're our closest friends.

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,259
Hey, you're looking for one little answer.
There is no one traumatic event.

81
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,432
You know that. People grow apart.

82
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,477
It's a lot of little personal things.
Now, stop it.

83
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:57,351
- I don't want to hear this bullshit.
- Judy!

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,932
- What's she so upset for?
- Judy, what...

85
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,860
- She cares about us.
- I care about you too.

86
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:05,438
Hey, hey, we're fine, okay?
We want to do this.

87
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,525
Judy. Judy? This is crazy.

88
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,577
Listen, Judy, what are you
taking this so personally for?

89
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,827
- I'm upset, all right? Can't I be upset?
- Yeah, but, you know...

90
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:17,784
Judy, I've discussed this
with a therapist. Really.

91
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,712
You have?
You've never said a word!

92
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,631
You said this was none
of our business. What is happen...

93
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:27,256
Well, we were all so close!
Or I assumed we were.

94
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,053
- She's upset. She's very upset.
- Hey, hey, hey.

95
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,848
Will you guys please
not turn this into a wake?

96
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,802
You know, what-what, why... what is this
such a personal thing for you?

97
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:37,057
I don't know what to say.

98
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,855
Let's just go out to dinner
as planned and forget it.

99
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:44,026
- Judy, come on!
- I knew this would turn into a big thing.

100
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:46,695
So, why were you so upset?

101
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:49,489
I don't know. I really don't know.

102
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,910
- It was a total shock?
- Yeah, completely.

103
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:56,205
You know, they-they-they
were so casual about it.

104
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:59,125
They didn't seem to be
appropriately upset.

105
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,580
Well, were you hurt because Sally
never mentioned anything to you?

106
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:08,668
Well, I think, you know,
if I really look hard,

107
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,005
you know, searching over the time
when we were alone together,

108
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:16,058
I think she may have made
an occasional remark about, you know,

109
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,932
just wondering what it
would be like to be single...

110
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:23,232
Now, with all she knew,
all she'd experienced, that kind of thing.

111
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,483
But she never said any... anything
negative at all about Jack, you know.

112
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,939
Listen, before we go on.
Excuse me.

113
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,697
Just tell us something about yourself,
you know, so we know who you are.

114
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:37,781
Okay, um, my name is Judy Roth.
I'm married to Gabe.

115
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,582
Mm, we've been married
about ten years.

116
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,332
Um, I work for an art magazine.

117
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:47,631
We don't have any children. Um, I do have
a daughter from a previous marriage.

118
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,505
I was married when I was
very young to...

119
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:54,054
Excuse me... to an architect,
and it just didn't work out.

120
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,052
It was nobody's fault.

121
00:07:56,142 --> 00:08:00,307
<i>Judy told us she did
finallygo out to dinner that night.</i>

122
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,812
<i>She said she was tense and nervous,
although the others seemed fine.</i>

123
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,689
<i>After dinner, they walked home
from the restaurant together.</i>

124
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:11,693
<i>While she tried her best to participate,
she found the atmosphere strained.</i>

125
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:15,902
<i>All in all, she said, for her
it was a verypeculiar evening.</i>

126
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,996
It's amazing, isn't it?

127
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:23,121
You know, you think you're so friendly
with people, and so close,

128
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:27,421
and then it turns out that you really
have no idea what they're thinking.

129
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,217
Do you ever hide things from me?

130
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:35,671
Me? Wh-What kind of things?

131
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:41,181
I don't know. Feelings.
You know, longings, complaints.

132
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,148
No. Do you?

133
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,146
No.

134
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,987
Sometimes, maybe.

135
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,406
Really? Like what?

136
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:58,031
I don't know. You know
how you're always so critical.

137
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,989
W- We've had this conversation.

138
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,575
You know, you are definitely
in a strange mood tonight.

139
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,207
I'm fine. I'm sorry.

140
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,335
So Jack never, never
gave you an inkling, huh?

141
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,963
That's so strange.
You guys are so close.

142
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:16,342
Actually, I do remember one incident
he mentioned at his office.

143
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,798
Jack, you have to
trust me on this.

144
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,134
This girl is to die.

145
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,686
Her name is Shawn Grainger.
She's built out to here.

146
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:27,686
You will have
the greatest time of your life.

147
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:30,940
And for 200 bucks,
believe me, it's a bargain.

148
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,988
Hey, I'm not gonna sleep with a whore.
What about AIDS?

149
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:37,283
She's not a streetwalker.
She's a high-class call girl,

150
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,610
and she will do anything you want.

151
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,287
And on top of it,
she's got friends.

152
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:45,582
Hey, I'm not gonna do that
to my wife, all right? It's dangerous.

153
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:51,209
Look, who was the guy who told me that
your sex life wasn't so terrific, right?

154
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:55,259
Oh, come on. At a two-martini lunch,
I'll say, uh, anything.

155
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,088
Shawn has got a mouth
like velvet.

156
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,141
Believe me, just like vel...
She was a former Miss Something or other.

157
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,016
- Oh, she's got...
- Listen, what exactly did I say at lunch?

158
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:09,690
You said that Sally was cold,
and you would, uh...

159
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:13,110
You were dying to fuck
your aerobics trainer.

160
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,529
I should never,
ever drink at lunch.

161
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,528
Look, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna write down the number,

162
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,702
- and I advise you to... I advise you to...
- What are you doing? Look...

163
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:25,202
- Hey, what are you... Get out of here!
- Have I ever steered you wrong?

164
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:27,749
- I've never steered you wrong.
- Get out of here.

165
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,249
All right, there it is.
Use it.

166
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,632
He called me.

167
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:42,931
Um, I got the impression it was about
a month or so after he got my number.

168
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:45,725
Uh, he was very polite
on the phone. A little tense.

169
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:49,476
You know, I can always tell the ones
who haven't had experience.

170
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,855
He wanted me to meet him
at the Americana Hotel.

171
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,812
And when I got there,
he was very polite,

172
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,147
very gentlemanly, very nervous.

173
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,029
<i>He couldn'tgo through with the sex.</i>

174
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:03,953
<i>He couldn'tget it up.</i>

175
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:07,622
<i>While I was there, he experienced
some terrible pains in his chest.</i>

176
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:11,168
<i>And, uh, I thought he was having
a heart attack, but theypassed.</i>

177
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,166
And that was the last you saw of him?

178
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,589
No. He called me
a couple months later.

179
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:19,385
Um, I met him at the same hotel.
This time he slept with me.

180
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:22,963
And, um, then I started
seeing him fairly regularly.

181
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,969
Every two, three weeks.

182
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:29,019
He said he'd seen a psychiatrist
and worked out his problem.

183
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,143
One time I couldn't make it,
and I sent my girlfriend.

184
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,146
And then he started seeing the both of us.
You know, alternating.

185
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:38,980
Uh, then neither one of us
ever saw him again.

186
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:42,783
So he never called her. At least he had
the decency to throw the number away.

187
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,952
Well, to the best
of my knowledge.

188
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:48,531
But, you know, Jack is not a hooker guy.
Jack is very straitlaced.

189
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,161
And Sally's cold in bed.

190
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,243
Sally's cold... Well, that
shouldn't come as a surprise.

191
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:56,206
- She's very cerebral anyhow.
- Am I cold in bed?

192
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,962
No. Why would you say that?
Of course not.

193
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:02,136
But I am inhibited, right?
I remember you said that yourself.

194
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,134
Amazing.
You can't forget that.

195
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,808
We had one minor, little argument
years ago about that,

196
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:11,262
which you blew up into a major
confrontation, and I can't get it off...

197
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:14,099
Do you ever have the urge
to sleep with a whore?

198
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,184
- Me? No, definitely not.
- No?

199
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,395
- Yeah. Yeah, when I was in college, I did.
- Yeah?

200
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,027
You-You're in an odd mood tonight.
I can see it.

201
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:25,325
You know, I think Jack and Sally's
breakup has definitely affected you.

202
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,700
You think... You think
we'd ever break up?

203
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:32,784
What kind of question is that?
I'm not planning it. Are you?

204
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:34,994
- No.
- Okay.

205
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,796
But I don't know
how I'm gonna feel if...

206
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:41,341
If you continue to not want
to make me pregnant.

207
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,421
Hey, are we gonna have to
go through that conversation again?

208
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:48,258
- You know, you have a daughter...
- Yeah.

209
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,014
- She's a wonderful girl.
- I want another. I want another.

210
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,437
- Why? What is so important?
- Why?

211
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:56,687
It's cruel to bring life into this
terrible world, you know? It's not...

212
00:12:56,776 --> 00:13:00,019
Oh, don't glorify your refusal
on philosophical grounds.

213
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:03,902
You know, if you could see the angry look
on your face when you say that.

214
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:07,698
You wanna make love?

215
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:13,290
Okay, but I... You know,
if we can get into it in some way.

216
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,709
- I-I can't just do it on command.
- We can get into it.

217
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:19,914
- We can get into it.
- Okay, so put your diaphragm on.

218
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,920
Okay.

219
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,885
Hey, you would...
you would never tell me

220
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,309
you were putting your diaphragm on
and then not do it, right?

221
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,389
What? What a thing to say!

222
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,225
That's a terrible thing to say!
My God!

223
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,857
You really trust no one, do you?

224
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,313
No wonder people accuse you
of cynicism. Jesus!

225
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,900
Okay, I'm sorry. I apologize.
I'm tired. It's 1:00 in the morning.

226
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,485
Well, we don't have to do it.

227
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:53,493
- Are you still attracted to me?
- Yes, I'm attracted to you.

228
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,577
- Truly? Because we do it less and less.
- Yes. Of course.

229
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,084
Well, you know, our schedules
are not exactly conducive to...

230
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:03,587
Oh, that's just bullshit. You know,
when we wanted to, we found time.

231
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:04,962
Hey, come here. Come here.

232
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,170
People's parties,
in other people's bathrooms.

233
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,347
- Wherever.
- Sit and relax for a minute, will you?

234
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:15,269
If you remember clearly, when we used
to do that-that, that spontaneous sex,

235
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,598
you, you were very, you know...
you never really liked it.

236
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,604
You were always tense.
You always heard people in the next room,

237
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,027
eating or making noises
in the dining room.

238
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,356
Remember that? Now you remember it,
you know, in a glorified way.

239
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,614
- Are you ever attracted to other women?
- Who? Like who?

240
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,821
Well, like all those women
that you have in your class,

241
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,407
who are so talented
and insightful.

242
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,039
You know, I'm sure they
totally worship you.

243
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,293
Can I tell you that they don't want
an old man, all right?

244
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:47,047
I think an old man does better
than an old woman.

245
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:51,597
Well, then we're definitely
stuck with one another.

246
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,926
Now, come on.
You're-You're really... Come on.

247
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,772
<i>Some time later,
Sally had a dinner date with Paul,</i>

248
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,570
<i>a colleague at work
who had always liked her.</i>

249
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,927
- Hi, Sally. Come on in.
- Hello. Thank you very much.

250
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,510
Come into my rent-stabilized den.
Can I take your coat?

251
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,348
Oh, it's lovely. I, I love it.

252
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,685
- Thank you.
- Just, um...

253
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:50,318
<i>I thought we'd have a drink. And I was
able to get some tickets to Don Giovanni.</i>

254
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:52,525
- Great. Great.
- So, you all right?

255
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,235
- Yes, yes, I, I...
- What would you like?

256
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,571
Anything. Uh... white wine?

257
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,248
White wine.

258
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:05,538
Oooh.

259
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:10,797
I hear the staging of this opera
is not to be believed.

260
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,721
Oh, really? How fabulous.

261
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,342
- Oh, that's lovely. Oh!
- Oh, hey, don't worry about it.

262
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,144
- Excuse me.
- Don't worry about it. I'll get it later.

263
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,564
- Can I use the phone?
- Yeah, sure. Uh, you all right?

264
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:27,563
- Yes! Yes, I'm looking forward to it.
- Uh, it's this way.

265
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,236
- Through here?
- A good friend of mine did the sets.

266
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,610
- Oh.
- Uh, you want...

267
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,161
It's me. You're living with her,
aren't you? You've moved in together.

268
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:41,490
Don't lie to me, Jack.
You're living with someone.

269
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:44,247
Because I know. Because I do.

270
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:46,829
Yes, I heard.

271
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,210
Don't give me that shit!

272
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,510
It's been three fucking weeks!
How did you meet someone so fast?

273
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:56,885
Oh, bullshit! You had to
have known her before.

274
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,684
Bullshit! Don't give me that shit!

275
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:05,356
Oh, you're in love? So fast?

276
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,611
I don't fucking believe it!

277
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,986
You were seeing
whoever it is all along.

278
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:19,362
Well, of-of course
I expected things to happen.

279
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,994
But not so fast!
Are you that sure?

280
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,291
No, I'm not.

281
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:32,671
Oh, God, it's just
fucking dishonest bullshit!

282
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,512
Hi. You, uh, you...

283
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,685
I'm fine. I am fine.

284
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,763
Listen, if you're having
some kind of personal thing...

285
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,688
Really, I'm okay.

286
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,939
I'm looking forward to tonight.
What are we seeing?

287
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,521
<i>- Uh, Don Giovanni.
- A Don Juan story.</i>

288
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:58,484
I can only think of it as Mozart.

289
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:00,945
Fucking Don Juans.

290
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,031
They should've cut
his fucking dick off.

291
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:09,912
Uh, can I, can I
get you some more wine?

292
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,918
Please.

293
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,711
You know, we don't...
we don't have to go.

294
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,298
No. No, no. I'm not gonna
put my life on hold.

295
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:24,760
I've been dying to see this opera.

296
00:18:24,854 --> 00:18:28,393
- Excuse me one second.
- Sure.

297
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:32,066
Hello. Me again.
I know who she is.

298
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,567
Bullshit! It's Gale.
Of course it's Gale!

299
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,194
She's been after you
since she joined the firm.

300
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:40,697
You two like that sports bullshit.

301
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,153
Don't lie to me, Jack.
Of course it's Gale!

302
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:46,160
She's exactly what you like.
She's got that dark look,

303
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,334
and she's bright and all that
fucking Princeton bullshit.

304
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,457
No! No, no!

305
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,711
I, I thought it was an...
it was an experiment!

306
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,714
I didn't think it was final. I didn't
realize you were having an affair!

307
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,923
Yeah? Well, that's bullshit!
I don't buy a fucking word of it!

308
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,223
What time do we
have to be there?

309
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:11,523
Listen, uh, I-I don't
really think I can do this.

310
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,101
I'm feeling upset.

311
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:18,189
What are you upset about?
Fucking men!

312
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:21,400
A woman gets to be over a certain age,
it becomes a different ball game!

313
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:26,410
- Oh, no, no. Not really.
- Don't defend your sex! It's true!

314
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:30,618
You're great till you start
to show your age.

315
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,828
Then they want a newer model.

316
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:37,007
Sally, Sally, Sally, you're...

317
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:40,086
You're a very attractive woman...
for any age.

318
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,091
Hmph!

319
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,514
It was a terrible blow to my ego.

320
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,762
You know, I thought he loved me,

321
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,640
that we were experimenting,
you know?

322
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,098
What if you had met someone first?

323
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,855
Tsk. Probably right.

324
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,813
Probably would have done
the same thing.

325
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:03,697
I had fantasized about
being single many times.

326
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:06,449
You know,

327
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,657
it's hard to keep a marriage
going smoothly

328
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,538
with all the frustration
and baggage.

329
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,792
I don't know. I don't know.

330
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:20,425
Gale came to work in his office
the year before,

331
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:22,924
<i>and I had met her several times.</i>

332
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,972
<i>Look, what can I say?
She's-She's</i>

333
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,142
cultivated, intelligent.

334
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,436
<i>It's what he likes.</i>

335
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,606
<i>She'd been over to the house
a few times.</i>

336
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:37,480
<i>She loved my taste in everything.</i>

337
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,607
<i>She even dressed like me a little.</i>

338
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,611
What can I say? She's me,
but she's younger, you know?

339
00:20:55,254 --> 00:21:00,545
Hey, listen, your short story
was absolutely fabulous.

340
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,296
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

341
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,423
I was very, very impressed,
I must say.

342
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:07,847
And I thought it was probably
the best thing that I read this term.

343
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,300
- It was really wonderful.
- Oh, that's great!

344
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,933
Yeah. The insights were great,
and I thought the prose was very graceful.

345
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:17,767
And, you know, in general,
I was, I was impressed.

346
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,274
- Oh, God, I'm blushing, right?
- Well, don't. You know, I...

347
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:26,609
My face gets all red.
I may just cry. Um...

348
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,992
Don't take it that, that badly.
I meant it as a compliment.

349
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,322
- Well, I know, but...
- It was great.

350
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,623
The insights were wonderful.

351
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,998
It's just, your approbation means
more to me than anybody's.

352
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:40,046
I mean, you're the reason
why I wanted to start writing.

353
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,340
- Really?
- Yeah.

354
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:46,466
My family and I, we used to quote,
you know, "The Grey Hat."

355
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:49,673
- Oh, God. How do you remember that story?
- Yeah.

356
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,555
Where it goes,
"Giving up his hopes,

357
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:56,264
compromising one's dreams,
is like putting on a grey hat."

358
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,815
We used to...
I loved that! I mean...

359
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:01,143
You remember that. That's great.

360
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,821
Listen to me.
You can hear my heart beating. Oh...

361
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,240
H- How'd you get
the name Rain?

362
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:12,242
Uh, my parents named me
after, uh, Rilke.

363
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,244
- Did they?
- Yeah. That's my mother's favorite poet,

364
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,748
and, um,
so that's how I got it.

365
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:21,501
Are you folks,
you know, writers or...

366
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,628
Oh, no. My dad's
an investment banker,

367
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:26,960
and my mom works
at Lincoln Center.

368
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,717
Uh-huh.
Are you an only child?

369
00:22:29,807 --> 00:22:32,641
Why are you asking
all these questions?

370
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,763
Oh, I'm just... I'm just interested.

371
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:36,937
You know, I was so impressed
by the, by the story.

372
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,604
I gave it to someone else to read,

373
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:41,104
and she was also very,
very impressed with it, so I...

374
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,358
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. Are you from New York or...

375
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,531
- Yeah, I'm from East End. East End Avenue.
- Are these too many questions?

376
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:53,078
No, it's fine. It's just the "only child"
one. Yes, I was an only child.

377
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:55,746
- You know. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:59,543
So how did you manage
to write something so, so deep?

379
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:03,212
I mean, I-I... Have you had a...
Have you been married and divorced?

380
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:08,010
Or, I... Is your whole family stormy
and tempestuous or...

381
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:12,715
What? I didn't know I was
stormy and tempestuous.

382
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:17,724
- The writing was very... was very intense.
- I don't know. Yeah.

383
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,726
It's-It's just a trick, you know?

384
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,559
It's like, um,
when I was ten, one time

385
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,987
I wrote this whole story on Paris,
and I'd never even been there, you know?

386
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:30,315
So it's, like, you don't have to...

387
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:33,743
It's just a trick.
You don't have to know or...

388
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,822
Can you, can you just
turn it out? I mean...

389
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:48,751
There are a number
of very, very good professors

390
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:52,804
who are notorious for seducing
their female pupils.

391
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,430
This goes on, and, um...
because it's a cinch.

392
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,932
You know, they-they look up to them,

393
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,935
and they're, you know,
they're older men,

394
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:06,985
and their students
are flattered by the attention.

395
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,484
It's not something
that I've ever done.

396
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:13,817
I'm not saying that I haven't
had daydreams in class at times,

397
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:17,075
because some of those women
are very attractive and very interesting,

398
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,032
but I've never,
I've never acted on it,

399
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,493
and I've, you know,
I've never cheated on Judy,

400
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:27,001
um, or any other relationship
in my life, really,

401
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:31,051
'cause that, that has
not been my style, um, to...

402
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:35,221
But once, many years ago...
One time, many years ago...

403
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:39,893
I was, uh, living with this fabulous,
interesting woman

404
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,062
<i>named Harriet Harmon.</i>

405
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,231
<i>I'm ashamed to say this,
but Harriet Harmon remains...</i>

406
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,526
<i>was the great love of my life.</i>

407
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,774
<i>You know, it was
a verypassionate relationship.</i>

408
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,197
You know,
I loved her very, very intensely,

409
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:56,822
and, you know, she...
We just made love everywhere.

410
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,030
She was, she was sexually
carnivorous, you know?

411
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:03,413
She-She...
We did it in stalled elevators

412
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,416
and in bushes
and people's houses,

413
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,498
at parties in the bathroom.

414
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,254
And, I hate to tell you,
in the back of cars,

415
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,677
she'd-she'd put a coat
on our laps

416
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:17,676
and then suddenly grab my hand
and stick it between her legs.

417
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,304
I mean, she was really
something, and she...

418
00:25:20,394 --> 00:25:24,729
You know, she was...
she was highly, highly libidinous.

419
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:27,182
You know what I mean?
She used to...

420
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,893
She wanted to make love
with other women,

421
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:32,195
and she used to...
she got into dope for a while.

422
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:37,993
She would break that thing you sniff
when she'd have her orgasm.

423
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:41,116
And, you know, I was...
For me, I was getting a real education.

424
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,665
And I was, you know, fascinated.
I was just absolutely nuts about her.

425
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:49,872
And, um, you know, ultimately
she wound up in an institution.

426
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,673
I mean, it's not funny.
It was a very sad thing.

427
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,879
She was, you know, great
but-but nuts.

428
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:00,090
See, I've always had,

429
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:05,600
um, this penchant for what I call
kamikaze women, because they...

430
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:08,807
I call 'em kamikazes because they,
you know, they crash their plane.

431
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:13,362
They're self-destructive. But they crash
it into you, and you die along with them.

432
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,359
Now, soon as there's a challenge,

433
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:18,362
as soon as there's very little chance
of it working out, or no chance,

434
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:21,490
or there's gonna be hurdles or obstacles,
something clicks into my mind.

435
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,663
Maybe that's because I'm a writer.

436
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:26,662
But some dramatic or aesthetic
component becomes right,

437
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,539
and I go after that person.

438
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:31,542
And there's a certain
dramatic ambience that...

439
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:34,716
that's almost as if I'm in...
I fall in love with the person,

440
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:37,089
in love with the situation
in some way.

441
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:40,172
And, um, of course, it has
not worked out well for me.

442
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,848
It has not been great, and, um...

443
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:46,099
<i>Anyhow, a few weeks
after Jack and Sally split,</i>

444
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:49,352
<i>you know,
he and I didn't speak much.</i>

445
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,104
<i>And because I, you know,
found him elusive at the time,</i>

446
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:54,356
<i>and we spent much more time
with Sally.</i>

447
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,780
<i>And she was depressed, you know, and
we'd try and cheer her up all the time.</i>

448
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,734
I would be scared to live by myself
where you live.

449
00:27:00,828 --> 00:27:03,070
- It is scary. It's really scary.
- Yeah, I can believe it.

450
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,155
And there's been
a series of burglaries.

451
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,662
- The house next door to mine was robbed.
- Really?

452
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,539
- And nearby, the people were at home.
- Excuse me. Really?

453
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,542
- It's lucky for them I didn't wake up.
- I would die.

454
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:16,545
I- I'd never close my eyes
at night if I had to.

455
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,422
So do you want to
get something to eat or what?

456
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:19,502
Sure.

457
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:21,553
Hey!

458
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,268
- Sam. This is Sam.
- Hi. How are you?

459
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,346
- Gabe and Sally.
- This is Judy.

460
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,182
- Hi, Judy.
- Well, look, I have to go. I'm sorry, but...

461
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:35,519
- Oh, don't be silly.
- No, I have an appointment. I really do.

462
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,729
- Really?
- No, don't be crazy!

463
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:40,065
- Well, I have an appointment.
- We're going to get something to eat.

464
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,072
I just wanted you guys...

465
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,406
Oh! Oh, God!

466
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,550
- Some coincidence, huh?
- Oh, wha... I didn't get your name before.

467
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,552
- Sam.
- Sam. Right. Okay, Sam.

468
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:08,680
So-So you guys are just walking
around down here? I mean, what...

469
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,183
- We just had lunch across the street.
- What do you do, uh, Sam?

470
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:13,185
- Aerobics.
- She's great at it.

471
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:16,063
- And I'm a trainer, and some nutrition.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

472
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,896
- This is...
- Hey, what are you guys doing later?

473
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,902
You want to come and have dinner at
the house? She's an unbelievable cook.

474
00:28:21,992 --> 00:28:24,029
- I am.
- Oh, I don't think it's possible tonight.

475
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,327
- It's totally vegetarian.
- Well, we can't. We can't tonight.

476
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,030
- You don't eat meat, do you?
- No, no, I don't. She eats it a little.

477
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:32,162
I used to eat red meat every day,
and then I gave it up.

478
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,710
Then I had some again recently,
and I was totally bloated.

479
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:35,912
Look, we can order out.

480
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,168
There's a little Mexican place
around the corner,

481
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,965
if you don't like this vegetarian stuff.

482
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,214
Oh, yeah!
I flip over couscous!

483
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:43,795
You feel like cookin'?
Let's do it. Come on.

484
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:45,380
Whatever you want.

485
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:48,933
- We're gonna stay in, watch the Grammys.
- I can't, you know, because...

486
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,762
I'm not watching the Grammys.
She watches all these dumb-ass shows.

487
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:54,063
I have a bet with Jill
over the best single!

488
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,142
- I'm not watching the Grammys, okay?
- My mother is in town.

489
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,149
Yeah, his mother is gonna be in
town for the rest of the week.

490
00:29:00,239 --> 00:29:03,198
Well, you know, maybe later.
I've been meaning to call.

491
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,491
- You know, I've thought about you guys.
- I wanted to call you last week.

492
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:07,443
While we're down here,
I'd like to pick up some decaf.

493
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,278
There's a great store!
I need some ginseng!

494
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:10,284
Okay.

495
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:14,493
She is really something.
She is so great.

496
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,999
You know, she's got a degree
in psychology.

497
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:19,877
- She's really into this, this fitness.
- You're fucking nuts.

498
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:23,460
Hey, she is terrific. She's in this
fitness thing. She's a nice girl.

499
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,921
Her family's from Delaware.
Her father's in police work.

500
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:30,258
I can't get my mind around this.
This is what you leave Sally for?

501
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:32,344
- Hey, that's not your... Be careful, man.
- I'm shocked!

502
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,474
I'm serious about her.

503
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:36,647
But, you know,
you're my friend. I love you.

504
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:39,020
I mean,
we've been friends for years.

505
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,977
It's like your IQ
is suddenly in remission.

506
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,232
Oh, please. Please!

507
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:45,110
- It's like a mini-stroke.
- Don't give me some moralizing discourse.

508
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,318
- You're not my rabbi. Quit it.
- I just can't believe it.

509
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,029
You know, you're married
to this woman for years.

510
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,536
You raised a family.
You know, she's wonderful.

511
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,615
Yeah?

512
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,373
- So she's a ball-breaker sometimes, but...
- She's a ball-breaker.

513
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,704
Don't you give me that bullshit.
I lived with her. You didn't.

514
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,414
- You don't know her.
- I don't know her, no.

515
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,546
So tell me something terrible.
It better be incriminating.

516
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,049
There's nothing terrible
to tell you, okay?

517
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,131
I care about her. She's great.
I don't want to hurt her.

518
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,965
That's not what this is about.

519
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:15,099
Then suddenly out of left field,
you take up with a cocktail waitress.

520
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,646
- And I'm supposed to...
- She's not a cocktail waitress.

521
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:19,645
- She's an educated girl.
- I'm thinking of you and Sally.

522
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:21,818
She's terrific.
She's warm, and she's nice.

523
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:24,816
I can relax around her.
I can breathe.

524
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:28,650
Sally was hyper. You know that.
She's great, but she's cold,

525
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,327
and she's-she's-she's difficult.

526
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,655
- You're telling me that.
- Her Radcliffe friends

527
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,866
and all that crap
about her interior decorator.

528
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,825
Hey, you wanna know something?
I was bored at the opera.

529
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,080
- Shh.
- I was bored at the opera.

530
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:41,754
She would never go
to a Giants game with me.

531
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,253
We would never
just sit around and relax.

532
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:47,256
If I put an ashtray down
in the wrong place in the house...

533
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:50,760
So suddenly you... It took you
15 years to understand this, right?

534
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,432
Okay, so I should've done it
a long time ago, but, you know...

535
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,261
I mean, there were kids,
and we're all scared of being alone.

536
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:58,438
Hey, listen,
I love Sally, okay?

537
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:02,142
Don't get me wrong. What's wrong
with aerobics? What am I, a snob?

538
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:05,273
- What's that got to do with aerobics?
- So she's not Simone de Beauvoir.

539
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,777
I want to enjoy
the rest of my life, okay?

540
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,950
I want somebody who digs her nails into
my back and screams when I fuck her.

541
00:31:11,036 --> 00:31:13,870
- She's a fucking cocktail waitress.
- Or at least moves.

542
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:16,572
Hey, I said stop it.
That's not your business, man.

543
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,283
You don't know what goes on
between two people.

544
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,210
I'm tired of being
corrected and criticized.

545
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:25,040
That's all I ever did with Sally.
I was always auditioning.

546
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,672
And your mother is not in town, Gabe.
She's in Florida.

547
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:31,721
I really think
no matter how hard we worked,

548
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,470
the marriage
wouldn't have lasted.

549
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,222
How long were you and Judy married?

550
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,100
Um... five years.

551
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,102
Why did you split up?

552
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,559
At the time,
I thought I wanted out.

553
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,612
I felt I had just run out of gas.

554
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:52,112
But as I look back at it, I think
it was really Judy who wanted out.

555
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:54,114
Oh, so she left you?

556
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,538
No. No, she'd never...
That's not her style.

557
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,037
Don't let Judy fool you.

558
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:03,336
She-She's what I call
passive/aggressive.

559
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:07,041
Everything is,
"Poor me, give me a break."

560
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:09,501
But she gets what she wants.

561
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:13,304
I remember the day she met
her current husband, Gabriel Roth.

562
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,804
My husband's staying out here
for the rest of the week with my daughter.

563
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:20,136
But I have to take the train in tomorrow
night. I have some business in town.

564
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,222
Let me give you a lift.
I'm gonna drive in tomorrow.

565
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,647
No, don't be silly!

566
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,897
- No, why should you go in on the train?
- The train is fine, really.

567
00:32:26,987 --> 00:32:30,480
I was just gonna get something to eat.
Would you like something?

568
00:32:30,574 --> 00:32:33,191
Me? No, no, no. I'll get you something.
What do you want?

569
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:35,117
I was just on my way.
Just tell me what you want.

570
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,071
No, I'll get you something. Pasta salad.
You want anything to drink?

571
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:39,030
- Just pasta salad?
- Yeah.

572
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:41,912
And I can easily get a cab
from Penn Station.

573
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,618
<i>- No, don't be silly.
- See what I mean?</i>

574
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,374
<i>He winds up getting the food.</i>

575
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:48,423
<i>He changes his schedule,
drives her to her door.</i>

576
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:53,424
<i>And all the time, it's,
"No, no. I'll be okay. Don't help me."</i>

577
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,800
What my ex-husband doesn't say

578
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,224
is that for the last two years
of our marriage

579
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,802
he was virtually impotent,
when it came to me.

580
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:03,479
Um, he was just raging

581
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:08,026
because I didn't turn out
to be what he thought I'd...

582
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,320
He thought I'd be one thing.
His mother, to be exact.

583
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:16,401
And I couldn't take the fact that he
was totally unromantic in every way.

584
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:20,705
He was the kind of guy that gives you
an appliance for your birthday.

585
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:25,706
I- I never got her a Melior Coffeemaker
for a birthday present.

586
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,378
I got her a camera once

587
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:31,208
and an enlarger,
uh, for our anniversary.

588
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,759
But she wanted it.
She asked for it.

589
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,177
What are you thinking about?

590
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:44,308
I don't know. I was, I was just thinking
about that manuscript you're reading.

591
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,810
Oh, geez.
It's just a terrible novel.

592
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,814
- It's very autobiographical.
- Well, what else am I gonna work on?

593
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:54,693
- Should I be insulted?
- Why should you be insulted?

594
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:58,572
Your description of the way we met...
that party in the Hamptons.

595
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:02,906
<i>"He spotted her from
a distance, and Harriet leapt to mind.</i>

596
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:06,288
<i>It was that simple.
He was drawn to her instantly,</i>

597
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:09,962
<i>because she reminded him
of his only genuine passion.</i>

598
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,882
<i>His sixth sense
told him to move on it.</i>

599
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,051
<i>But she wasn't Harriet.</i>

600
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,970
<i>The minute he met her,
the dream evaporated."</i>

601
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,299
- Yeah, right. So she wasn't crazy.
- Oh, no, just boring.

602
00:34:21,393 --> 00:34:23,635
Oh, no. She's the best
woman in the book.

603
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,811
- That's why he marries her.
- But he pays a price.

604
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:29,061
This is just junk anyhow.
I want to throw it away.

605
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,565
No, you're wrong. Listen,
it's full of vitality and wit. It's good.

606
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:36,773
- You're prejudiced, 'cause you're my wife.
- Your dull wife.

607
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,574
I don't know why you ask
for my opinion ever.

608
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,903
You know?
You don't care about it.

609
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,239
- That's not true.
- It is true.

610
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:47,791
Mm-mmm. I happen to think
it's a mediocre novel.

611
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:50,836
Because you have no respect
for my judgment.

612
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:55,337
If somebody else came along and-and
said that, you'd accept it totally.

613
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:56,713
I would not.

614
00:34:57,804 --> 00:35:01,468
<i>After a little time passed,
Judy and Sally had lunch.</i>

615
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:03,766
<i>Sally made a surprising announcement.</i>

616
00:35:03,852 --> 00:35:06,890
I like being single.

617
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:10,599
You do?
I had the opposite impression.

618
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:13,435
Well, that's all anticipatory anxiety.

619
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,942
When you calm down, you realize
it's not as bad as you fantasized.

620
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:19,069
It's like pulling a bad tooth.

621
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:22,277
All the festering wounds
of your marriage,

622
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,532
the disappointments,
the resentments,

623
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:28,116
they're gone in one clean yank,
and you're free.

624
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,326
- Boy!
- You can't imagine.

625
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:35,006
After years of accumulating problems
and swallowing one's anger,

626
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,128
to have the chance to begin again.

627
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,631
Yeah, I-I can imagine.

628
00:35:39,721 --> 00:35:41,713
The clock ticks faster
for a woman.

629
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:45,299
You have to do it while you
still have some allure left.

630
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,885
The one advantage
of being a little older

631
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,643
- is you have a lot of experience.
- Yeah.

632
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:56,273
I have a much better shot at making things
work out... if I meet someone.

633
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,528
I've often thought that if Gabe and I met
now, knowing all the things we know,

634
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:04,327
we'd have a better relationship,
no question.

635
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,950
Would you still marry him?

636
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,748
God, what a question!

637
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:19,133
You know, for me, I just... the thought
of breaking up is just so painful.

638
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:23,259
You can't stay together out of fear,
because then you know what you become?

639
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:25,806
- What?
- My mother and father.

640
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:32,688
Well, I... I've pictured myself free.

641
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,858
I know you have.

642
00:36:35,944 --> 00:36:37,856
How do you know?

643
00:36:37,946 --> 00:36:39,482
Because you got so angry
that night

644
00:36:39,572 --> 00:36:43,407
when Jack and I
said we were splitting.

645
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:47,362
I thought about it later.
I realized we must have touched a nerve.

646
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,074
- No.
- Yes, it's like Hamlet and Oedipus.

647
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:55,377
You were angry that night because
I did what you really want to do.

648
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:58,046
No, you're overdramatizing.

649
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:02,377
Gabe and I are okay.
Nobody has it perfect.

650
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,962
I know. I know.

651
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:08,049
Listen, when it's good,
nothing's better. Hmm.

652
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:12,387
Listen, so I think maybe
I have a possibility for you.

653
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,143
- Tell me.
- Michael Gates?

654
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,145
The one you said
was attractive in your office?

655
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,476
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

656
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,903
He's only been there a few months.

657
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:24,073
I know he had a girlfriend,
but now they've broken up.

658
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,745
I do think he's attractive.
He's-He's-He's charming. He's bright.

659
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,743
The timing's perfect.
What more could you want?

660
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:34,576
I just think if you'd come up
to the office now

661
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,911
and meet him
and see how you feel...

662
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:40,794
If you think you're interested, we could
all, I don't know, arrange something.

663
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:43,001
We'll all go out together or something.

664
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,757
<i>Michael, this is my friend Sally.</i>

665
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,681
- I'm finding some back issues for her.
- Hi, Sally.

666
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,100
Sally's with the Landmarks
Preservation Committee.

667
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:53,599
Oh, Preservation Committee.
Well, I'll tell you something.

668
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,897
I don't believe in capital punishment,
except for certain New York builders.

669
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,100
It's not just New York, though.

670
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,107
There's always just a blind passion
for the new, the young.

671
00:38:02,197 --> 00:38:04,109
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh. Hello.

672
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,363
You two wait here, and I'll go and Xerox
those copies. I'll be right with you.

673
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,818
- Uh, fine.
- Take your coat off.

674
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:10,528
- Make yourself comfortable.
- All right.

675
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:13,581
Throw it anywhere.
Sorry about the clutter.

676
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,874
We're in the middle of putting
together a full issue

677
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,577
of German furniture styles
in the '20s and '30s.

678
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,958
- I hate that period.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

679
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:23,541
I did my college thesis
on Bauhaus architecture.

680
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:26,423
- It was called "Function and Fascism."
- Mm-hmm.

681
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,426
This was years ago at Radcliffe,
you know.

682
00:38:29,516 --> 00:38:32,224
I got so much flak on it.
It was very unpopular.

683
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,144
Not that it won't make
a good magazine subject.

684
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,893
Well, go on. Have a look at that chair.
Do you remember that?

685
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,816
- Yes, I, I truly dislike that chair.
- Isn't it wonderful?

686
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:43,064
- Okay, what about this one here?
- I hated that chair.

687
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:46,318
So, what do you think?
Isn't he sweet?

688
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,569
Well, yes. He seems nice.

689
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,949
Yeah, I think he's sort of
great-looking, don't you?

690
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:55,998
- And he's single and not gay.
- Oh, I'm telling you, he just broke up.

691
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:59,748
I don't know him that well.
You know, he-he's kind of quiet.

692
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,707
But I like that about him.
He's got a great sense of humor.

693
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,919
And he's a very charming drunk, because
it was somebody's birthday party up here,

694
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,254
and he had quite a lot of whiskey,

695
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,386
and he was quoting Yeats' poems
and he was crying.

696
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:16,890
- He was? He weeps?
- Yes. But in the sweetest way.

697
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,189
So, what do you think?
Shall I get us all together?

698
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:23,188
Oh, you don't have to.
He already asked me to lunch.

699
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:25,361
- He did?
- Mm-hmm.

700
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,358
Oh.

701
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,065
It came up that we both
took courses at Cambridge.

702
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:30,990
Uh-huh.

703
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,195
Well, he suggested we both have
lunch next week, so, you know...

704
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:38,078
That would be great.
I'd be the matchmaker.

705
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,035
I, I took an instant liking for Sally.

706
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,792
God, I was immediately attracted to her.

707
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:47,876
She spoke her mind, she spoke
her thoughts, which I really liked.

708
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:50,552
And she's, she's very sexy,
you know?

709
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,222
Um, now look, remember, I wasn't
looking for another relationship,

710
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:59,225
because I'd just split up with Amy,
and I'd sworn off gettin' involved.

711
00:39:59,314 --> 00:40:02,182
But with Sally, God, there was,

712
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:05,063
there was something
that just hooked in at once.

713
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,736
So you were grateful
to Judy for introducing you?

714
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,939
Yes, I was, very.

715
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:14,448
It's funny, you know, when I...
when I first got to know Judy,

716
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,746
I had the vague impression that she
was flirting with me, you know?

717
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:22,167
And I thought she must be
unhappily married, you know.

718
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:24,916
But I met her husband,
and they seemed fine.

719
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,043
But that seems typical of Judy, you know?

720
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:32,595
She's very giving, and she did me
this big favor by introducing me to Sally.

721
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,095
Your second story was every bit
as interesting as your first.

722
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,768
- I just thought it was wonderful.
- Oh, great!

723
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,438
- I was knocked out by it.
- I'm thrilled. I'm so glad you like it.

724
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:47,234
You're so encouraging to me, you know?
I want you to know that.

725
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,358
No, don't be... Oh, don't be silly.
I'm just one opinion.

726
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,906
<i>- And I was impressed.
- I know, but you're the opinion.</i>

727
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,029
I thought your line
was great about, uh,

728
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,283
"Life doesn't imitate art;
It imitates bad television."

729
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,081
- Because it is completely true.
- Right.

730
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:06,538
I can't tell you how much your opinion
means to me, you know?

731
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,874
- Oh, you know...
- Listen, you wanna go for a walk?

732
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:12,255
- Or I mean...
- A walk?

733
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:15,884
- You're busy, right?
- No, no, no, no, no. Wha-Wha...

734
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:18,933
I just meant for a walk,
like to discuss the...

735
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,852
- You want to hear more about your story.
- Yeah. Well, no...

736
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:25,807
You know, it was great. I thought
the way that you structured the story...

737
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,314
Because the tension built up
so, so beautifully,

738
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,317
and you released all the energy
in the last paragraph.

739
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,070
- I thought that was very sophisticated.
- Oh, thanks.

740
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:39,870
I spent five days searching for
the perfect word to describe the husband,

741
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,664
and that's when
I came up with "appucious."

742
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,039
"Appucious," yeah. I looked that up
in the dictionary, but I couldn't find it.

743
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:48,496
- Yeah, I know. I made it up.
- Oh, really?

744
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,002
- I thought it described it perfectly.
- Oh, you...

745
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:53,675
Tolstoy is a full meal.

746
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:57,471
Uh, Turgenev, I would say,
is a fabulous dessert.

747
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,345
- That's how I'd characterize him.
- And Dostoyevsky?

748
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:05,055
Dostoyevsky is a full meal with, um,
a vitamin pill and extra wheat germ.

749
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:08,266
"I fall upon the thorns of life.
I bleed."

750
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,352
I used to think
that was so romantic.

751
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,732
Oh, to write, to fall in love

752
00:42:15,825 --> 00:42:18,317
and to experience real passion.

753
00:42:18,411 --> 00:42:21,870
Really? You-You think that passion
could actually be sustained?

754
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:25,290
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Time magazine, they said</i>

755
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,619
you lose your sexual attraction
for the other person in four years,

756
00:42:28,713 --> 00:42:30,295
I think it was.

757
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,293
Well, you know...

758
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,340
<i>- And Time must know, right?
- Yeah.</i>

759
00:42:34,427 --> 00:42:39,297
I sometimes think of living in Paris,
you know, or Europe in general.

760
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,679
I just find that very romantic, you know?
'Cause I like café life.

761
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:44,886
I would like to write,
get maybe a small flat or something.

762
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,186
That sounds great.

763
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:48,980
Yeah, well, just walking
the streets is fun in Paris.

764
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,980
Listen, let me tell you.
Until you've been kissed

765
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,438
on one of those rainy Parisian afternoons,
you've never been kissed.

766
00:42:55,531 --> 00:42:57,898
- I promise you.
- And were you kissed in the rain?

767
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,234
Well, I-I wasn't kissed,
but I was the kisser.

768
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:05,665
Okay, I was wondering
if I could read your novel.

769
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,833
How'd you know I had a novel?

770
00:43:07,919 --> 00:43:11,503
Um, you mentioned it at lunch,
when we had lunch that time.

771
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,673
Ah. You know, it's... I'm very
disenchanted with it. I'm really...

772
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:17,593
Yes. I know.
And I'm only asking you

773
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,512
because I think I could learn
a lot from it,

774
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,512
and I just would like to know
what you like and what you don't like

775
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,515
and why you're so critical
of it, you know?

776
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,689
- Let me think about it.
- Whoo!

777
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:33,017
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

778
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:37,071
Well, let me think about it.
I- I'll think about it, you know, and...

779
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:39,990
- Oh, I shouldn't have asked you.
- No, no, no, no, no.

780
00:43:40,076 --> 00:43:43,035
- L-L-Let me think about it.
- Okay.

781
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:46,910
Oh, Gabe. He's always picked
the wrong women. Except for Judy.

782
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:51,118
She's the first... you know, she's the first
sane woman he ever fell for.

783
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:56,458
He's always attracted to the crazies,
the nutcases, for some reason.

784
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,167
I got a couple of theories about it.

785
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:03,473
One is that, deep down somewhere,
he knows it's not gonna work.

786
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:06,801
So he suffers,
and that, that kind of atones

787
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:10,478
for some sort of early-on guilt
he's got.

788
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,648
Over what, I don't know.

789
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,066
Another is,
like, you know, all of us,

790
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:18,942
he grew up on movies
and novels

791
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:22,320
where doomed love was romantic.

792
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:25,528
Well, what about you?
How are things going with Sam?

793
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:29,865
Great. Absolutely great.
You know, Saturday, we got up.

794
00:44:29,959 --> 00:44:32,747
<i>We had a run down by the river.
It was a beautiful day.</i>

795
00:44:32,837 --> 00:44:35,921
<i>The light was great, you know?
It was just terrific.</i>

796
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,920
<i>I'm down to a good weight.
She's got me exercising.</i>

797
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,923
<i>It feels,
feels incredible to get in shape.</i>

798
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:44,175
<i>I eatgreat. That's the other thing.</i>

799
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:47,224
<i>You know, salads, no meat.
Never touch meat.</i>

800
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:51,179
<i>Later in the day, we rented a...
some kind of a video, you know?</i>

801
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:55,107
<i>It was some sort of dopey,
funny, stupid little thing.</i>

802
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:58,027
<i>Something Sally would have never
let me bring in the house.</i>

803
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,399
<i>I want to tell you something.
I laughed like hell.</i>

804
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:04,483
<i>I had a terrific time, and
I didn't have to feel guilty about it.</i>

805
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,741
<i>Like I said, she's not Simone de Beauvoir,
okay? We argue sometimes.</i>

806
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,244
Trust me on this, will you?
It's Lear. King Lear.

807
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:14,202
Shakespeare never wrote
about a King Leo.

808
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,378
Well, Mr. Intellectual,

809
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:19,047
Shakespeare wrote in English,
not Japanese.

810
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,045
That's wonderful.

811
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,970
Mm, I was just gonna make some cappuccino
or something. You want some?

812
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,048
- Nope.
- You're sure?

813
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,884
I'm positive. Absolutely. Mm.

814
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:33,596
Listen, don't start getting all excited.

815
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,227
I don't have my diaphragm in.

816
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:40,561
Tonight I want to make love to you
without your diaphragm.

817
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,988
What are you talking about?

818
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:45,236
I'm serious.
I was thinking about it,

819
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,488
and I, you know,
I thought maybe,

820
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:52,243
you know, maybe I've been resisting
having a child too strenuously.

821
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:55,246
What? What are you...
Since when?

822
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,874
I don't know. I don't know.
I just was, uh...

823
00:45:57,964 --> 00:46:00,422
These are just some thoughts
that I've had, that's all.

824
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,501
I thought maybe, you know, maybe
it would be helpful in some way.

825
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:06,302
What kind of help were you...
did you have in mind?

826
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,382
- I don't know.
- Are you unhappy in our marriage?

827
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:13,094
You know, I... to tell you the truth,
I don't think about it that much.

828
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,349
Which is probably a good sign.

829
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,852
You know, it's late.
It's... I'm tired.

830
00:46:17,942 --> 00:46:20,400
Do you really want
to talk about this now?

831
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,399
All I said was I thought it was
a good idea to have a baby.

832
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,606
I don't think
it's such a good idea.

833
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,942
Why?
Why not all of a sudden?

834
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:30,903
Because I think that we have
some straightening out to do

835
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,488
before we have a baby.

836
00:46:32,581 --> 00:46:35,619
You wanted to have a baby.
Why are you in such a bad mood?

837
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,793
Do you want somebody new?

838
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:42,794
<i>No! Who? Like who?
I mean, do you?</i>

839
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:45,626
Certainly not a baby.

840
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,339
Okay, so forget it. I was bringing it up
because I thought you wanted...

841
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,765
- Okay, fine.
- Are you...

842
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:55,765
You're in a bad mood, or something you
want to say to me and you're not saying.

843
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,062
We should be careful.

844
00:46:57,148 --> 00:47:00,107
We don't want to get into one
of those things you can't get out of.

845
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,856
So you don't want to have a baby, right?
I mean, that's what I should...

846
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:05,232
You know I do.

847
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:07,280
Okay, so then
we have to work on it.

848
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:11,110
But not tonight. Tonight, any thought
of sex is now, you know...

849
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:12,569
I'm sorry.

850
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,370
It's not your fault.
You know, this is crazy.

851
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:17,291
I'm begging you to have a baby
that I don't even want.

852
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,413
- I knew you didn't want it.
- I don't mean it that way.

853
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,039
I mean it differently.

854
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,964
You know, it's late,
and I'm, I'm confused.

855
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,588
You know, we have
a perfectly fine marriage.

856
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,839
I don't know what all this
talk is suddenly about.

857
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,344
Excuse me, Michael?
I brought you a wonton soup.

858
00:47:33,434 --> 00:47:36,347
- Since you were too busy to come to lunch.
- Oh, thanks, Judy.

859
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,520
You're a sweetheart.
Thank you.

860
00:47:38,606 --> 00:47:40,723
You're going
to Carnegie Hall, I see.

861
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,227
Yes, I'm going to see Mahler.
Mahler's Ninth.

862
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,650
Really? Oh.

863
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,444
- Jesus, I hope Sally likes Mahler.
- Of course she'll like it.

864
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,022
God, it's my favorite
of all of his.

865
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,574
- Let me give you some napkins.
- Thanks, Judy.

866
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,778
I've got this great place to bring her
to after the concert lets out.

867
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:58,036
A little supper joint run by
an Italian family. It's very intimate.

868
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,868
Got a courtyard,
trellis, little fairy lights.

869
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:04,125
- Sounds beautiful.
- Yeah, it is, it is.

870
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,002
It's funny, you know,

871
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,961
seein' someone who, you know,
who's just left a long marriage.

872
00:48:10,054 --> 00:48:12,842
I bet it's been a while
since she was courted,

873
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:14,889
romanced, so to speak,
you know?

874
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:16,932
Yes. I'm sure.

875
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:20,387
I'm such a square, Judy.
You know that?

876
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:23,315
I'm so old-fashioned.
I eat all that stuff up, you know?

877
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:28,021
Music, intimate restaurants,
candlelight joints and stuff.

878
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,151
I'm from a different era, I think.

879
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:32,733
Amy used to say I should've
been born in the 1800s.

880
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,819
I think she found it all a bit corny.

881
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:37,825
Oh, no, it's not at all corny.
It's very sweet.

882
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:41,329
Ah, but it's great, isn't it? I mean,
you go in for that stuff too, don't you?

883
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:42,580
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah.

884
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:10,278
- Oh.
- Well...

885
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,902
Tonight was fun, Sally, eh?

886
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:16,451
- Yes, it was good. It was good. Yes.
- That music was fantastic.

887
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:20,121
I usually hate Mahler, but it was good.

888
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:23,416
The last movement was too long.
I think he should've cut it down.

889
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,415
The second movement was good.
Well, you know, it began well.

890
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:29,464
- Yeah, it started a little bit...
- It gets sentimental, don't you think?

891
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,509
- Yeah, but...
- The conductor fought his way out.

892
00:49:32,595 --> 00:49:34,052
Oh, dinner was wonderful.

893
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:37,131
Although I should teach the chef
how to make an Alfredo sauce.

894
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,058
- It didn't quite make it.
- Oh, I'm sorry you didn't like it.

895
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,807
- You want a... coffee?
- Yeah. I mean, is it okay?

896
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,310
I'd love to.

897
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:48,267
Oh, no, I'm only yawning
because I'm hyper-oxygenating

898
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,522
because the car ride
just made me a little bit sick.

899
00:49:50,613 --> 00:49:54,607
I'm sorry, Sally. I know I'm not
the greatest driver in the world.

900
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,159
No, your driving was fine,
for the most part. It's not your fault.

901
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,114
I shouldn't have had that last margarita.
Three's my limit.

902
00:50:02,208 --> 00:50:04,825
I couldn't even finish the second.

903
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:07,787
Ah, this is, this is lovely.

904
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,464
It's very homely. English pine.
That's my... That's the finest.

905
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:14,509
I prefer French.
My decorator screwed me.

906
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:18,009
Anyhow, it's too big for one person.
I have to get a place in town.

907
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,385
It's funny
how your whole life changes.

908
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,934
- I'm scared here alone, you know?
- Oh, it must be terrible.

909
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,728
- There's been robberies.
- Yeah, I bet.

910
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:29,433
Uh, do you want to get married
again straight away, Sally,

911
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,689
or do you like being single?

912
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:33,691
I love being single.

913
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:37,866
Because, you know, I think certain
personalities just need to be married.

914
00:50:37,952 --> 00:50:41,286
- I disagree.
- Well, that's what they say.

915
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:44,331
Not me. I thought I did.

916
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,494
I do. I do.
I think it's time for me.

917
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:52,206
Uh-huh. So why have you
never gotten married?

918
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:55,292
Oh, I don't know.
I've... I got close,

919
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,845
uh, in my 20s once,
but it didn't work out.

920
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:01,890
- Is-Is wine okay?
- Oh, lovely. Thank you.

921
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:04,719
I want to be alone,
for a while at least.

922
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:07,850
I want to have a few experiences.

923
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:11,900
Then if it happens, great.
If not, that's just fine.

924
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:15,775
Well, I'm-I'm sure
you'll get what you want.

925
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,732
You're a very...
You're a very beautiful woman.

926
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,988
Oh, thank you.

927
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:33,668
- I can't. I can't go so fast.
- I'm sorry.

928
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,420
It's just, you know,

929
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:39,548
- metabolically, it's not my rhythm.
- I understand.

930
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,550
Thank you.

931
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,758
I haven't been in a social,
social situation, you know,

932
00:51:44,852 --> 00:51:48,220
that's meant anything to me
in-in-in a very long time.

933
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:52,024
Well, thank you, Sally.
I'm really glad to know you care.

934
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,601
Well, I would not
be here with you

935
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:58,530
if I wasn't at least interested
in exploring it, you know?

936
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:02,360
Well, cheers.

937
00:52:02,453 --> 00:52:06,413
- Cheers.
- Uh, tonight's meant a lot to me, Sally.

938
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,707
- Thank you.
- Lovely. That's nice.

939
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:19,592
- Okay, okay.
- What's the rush?

940
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:26,175
I'm sorry. I apologize. I'm just...
I'm overanxious because I like you a lot.

941
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:29,511
Oh, dear.

942
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,813
Michael, what can I say?

943
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:37,276
I haven't made love, you know,
in a... such a long time.

944
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:41,107
- Mm-hmm.
- My marriage, I told you, was, was dead.

945
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,409
- Sure.
- For years. I don't know why.

946
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:47,408
Oh, yes, I do. It's the second law
of thermodynamics.

947
00:52:47,498 --> 00:52:49,740
Sooner or later,
everything turns to shit.

948
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,576
<i>That's my phrasing,
not the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</i>

949
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,835
That is strange, too, because often
one doesn't even see it happening.

950
00:52:56,924 --> 00:53:00,759
I did.
That's the part that kills me.

951
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,756
<i>I was in town working.</i>

952
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,760
<i>Jack was supposed to be
out of town on business, in Chicago.</i>

953
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,718
<i>All of a sudden, by sheer accident...</i>

954
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,489
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi. Hey, how was Chicago?

955
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,871
It's, uh... It was good. I mean,
it was, well, busy. It was busy.

956
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,874
I mean, uh, he, the old guy
doesn't want to settle.

957
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:40,128
He's a tough old bird, boy.

958
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:49,884
I couldn't bring it up. I was so hurt.

959
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,936
And so full of rage.

960
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,058
And scared.

961
00:53:55,149 --> 00:53:58,483
For weeks, you know,

962
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:02,313
I waited for him to say he'd met
someone, but he never did.

963
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:06,901
Although I was always suspicious,
I never found another incident.

964
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:11,329
So I chose to overlook it,
and I hoped it would go away.

965
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,579
But it didn't

966
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:20,585
because I began thinking.

967
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,212
of getting rid of him

968
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,544
and being single.

969
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:28,755
And things just got worse
between us.

970
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,887
We put up
bigger and bigger fronts.

971
00:54:31,977 --> 00:54:35,311
Now I'm single

972
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:39,186
and I realize I'm one of those people
who needs to be married.

973
00:54:46,909 --> 00:54:50,152
- Hey. Hey, come here.
- Oh, hi.

974
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:52,783
- Where are you going?
- I'm just going home.

975
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:56,116
- Come on. I'll give you a lift.
- Oh, great.

976
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:57,701
Come on.

977
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,328
- I have a surprise for you.
- What?

978
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,505
I don't know if you'll think
it's such a surprise.

979
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,800
- I'm gonna let you read my novel.
- Oh, great!

980
00:55:05,886 --> 00:55:08,378
Oh, that's great. Thanks.

981
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:10,885
Now, you have to really go easy
on it because... you know.

982
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,966
Oh, of course.

983
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:15,052
- So you wanna come up?
- Now?

984
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:19,059
Come on. Yeah, meet my parents.
They're so in love with you.

985
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,311
- Don't you wanna see how I live?
- Well...

986
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,768
Richard,
what are you doing here?

987
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,603
So this is why
I don't see you anymore, huh?

988
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,405
What are you talking about?
That's... You're mistaken.

989
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,358
I'm mistaken. I just wanted
to see what he looked like.

990
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:31,283
No.

991
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:33,487
You're not what
I thought you'd look like.

992
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,163
- Yeah, beca... this isn't even my boyfriend.
- Oh, really?

993
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:38,708
<i>- Yeah, he's my professor. Yes.
- Your professor?</i>

994
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,831
- This is your professor.
- I'm professor Gabriel Roth.

995
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:43,709
Ah, nice to meet you.
Yeah. Columbia? Columbia?

996
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:44,835
Oh, stop.

997
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,009
- Yeah. How interested are you?
- Barnard.

998
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:52,214
Excuse me. I wanna ask you, Professor.
Do you seduce all your students?

999
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,219
- Stop it.
- I don't know what this is about.

1000
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,892
- I was just taking her upstairs to...
- I see.

1001
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,767
Just go, please.
I don't even know why you're here.

1002
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:01,894
- What are you doing here?
- Because you led me on!

1003
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:05,022
I did not lead you on! I told you
from day one I didn't want to marry.

1004
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:07,195
When you have her in your arms,
what does she say to you?

1005
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,112
Oh, stop it!

1006
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,690
- I don't know what to say.
- Why are you acting childish?

1007
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,616
- I ought to take you apart.
- That's ridiculous.

1008
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,696
- You're acting like a 15-year...
- I'm sorry, okay?

1009
00:56:15,789 --> 00:56:17,621
- You're sorry?
- Yeah, we were never meant to be.

1010
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,415
What do you think I am?

1011
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,493
I just know you're going
through one of your phases.

1012
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,670
- Why don't you just go in?
- I am.

1013
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,712
What, I'm trying to help you out here.

1014
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,382
- All right. Fine. I'm sorry.
- I'm getting cold. I'm getting cold.

1015
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,381
This is my mother,
and this is Professor Gabe Roth.

1016
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:34,430
It is such an immense pleasure
to meet you.

1017
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:37,224
- That's my father.
- Oh.

1018
00:56:37,311 --> 00:56:39,849
- It is an honor, sir.
- How do you do?

1019
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,306
- Now, what can we get you?
- Me? Nothing. I'm just... I'm fine.

1020
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,733
Just a, you know, sedative,
if you have one.

1021
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,357
Who was that character downstairs?

1022
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:50,939
- I'll tell you about it later.
- Oh, it's just you...

1023
00:56:51,033 --> 00:56:55,869
- It got so sunny all of a sudden.
- We're tremendous fans of yours.

1024
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:59,868
We wish you'd still write those funny,
short... funny, sad stories you wrote.

1025
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,870
- Let me take your coat.
- Oh, sure.

1026
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,000
So what were you gonna tell me
about that guy downstairs? Who is this?

1027
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:10,003
Oh, God. I better start from the beginning
then, if I'm going to tell you.

1028
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:14,588
Um, my father,
he had this, this colleague.

1029
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,094
It was his business partner,
and, um...

1030
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,800
This guy was your father's
business partner?

1031
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:21,682
No, no. This is why I have to tell you
way in the beginning.

1032
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:24,185
- It leads up to him.
- Mm-hmm.

1033
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,857
Um, and this...
my father's business partner...

1034
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,778
He'd come by the house
fairly often, right?

1035
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:33,982
<i>And one day he told me that
he was in love with me, right?</i>

1036
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:38,946
<i>And I was very flattered,
to say the least.</i>

1037
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,532
<i>He was, he was real bright and single.</i>

1038
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:44,834
<i>And we started having this affair.</i>

1039
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:47,287
<i>Naturally, we told nobody.</i>

1040
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:50,340
So now I have this friend Jane.

1041
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:52,337
And her parents, they were divorced.

1042
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:57,889
And her father Jerry developed
this mad crush over me, right?

1043
00:57:57,975 --> 00:58:02,470
Um, and before long,
I was seeing both these men.

1044
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:06,806
<i>And instead ofbeing happy,
I was, I was just miserable.</i>

1045
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,234
<i>And I couldn'tget my feelings straight.</i>

1046
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:12,232
<i>And so I went to an analyst.</i>

1047
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:15,815
<i>And... I tried for a few months
to work things out.</i>

1048
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:19,573
<i>And then, one day,
my analyst said that...</i>

1049
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,575
<i>that he was gonna stop
treating me</i>

1050
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:24,373
<i>because he felt it wasn't
the thing to do</i>

1051
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:26,826
<i>since he was falling in love with me.</i>

1052
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,288
<i>I was taken with him.</i>

1053
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:33,466
<i>I mean, you can imagine.
He's, he's quite brilliant.</i>

1054
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:35,839
<i>And I started seeing him.</i>

1055
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:40,173
<i>And I did.
I broke off from the other two.</i>

1056
00:58:41,935 --> 00:58:45,019
<i>But something inside me told me</i>

1057
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:49,065
that he couldn't be a very stable person,
I mean, let alone a good analyst.

1058
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:53,441
So, I never really let things
get too far with him.

1059
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:56,648
<i>Um, then one night I met Carl,</i>

1060
00:58:56,742 --> 00:59:00,486
<i>and he was very sweet
and he really came on with me.</i>

1061
00:59:00,579 --> 00:59:02,821
<i>And I came to my senses,</i>

1062
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:06,658
<i>and I said to myself, "What am I doing
with these older men, "you know?</i>

1063
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,119
<i>So I, I cleaned up my act.</i>

1064
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:11,875
<i>And I've been dating Carl.</i>

1065
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,878
<i>But, as you can see,
Richard is so unstable.</i>

1066
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,880
<i>He really took it badly.</i>

1067
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:20,008
My God. You've got material
for your first novel,

1068
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:24,388
and the sequel and,
and an opera by Puccini here.

1069
00:59:24,478 --> 00:59:27,767
- This is incredible.
- Yes, but don't you think I'm right?

1070
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:30,473
I mean, Carl... he's fun.

1071
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,435
And what the hell am I doing
with the mid-life crisis set?

1072
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:38,239
I mean, they're all, they're all
wonderful, rather accomplished men.

1073
00:59:38,325 --> 00:59:42,160
But, in the end, I just felt like
I was some kind of symbol

1074
00:59:42,245 --> 00:59:45,283
of lost youth or unfulfilled dreams.

1075
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:47,285
Or am I being too dramatic?

1076
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:52,166
Gabe. Gabe, now Rain's birthday party's
coming up soon, and we'd love you to come.

1077
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,622
Gee, I don't know
if it'd be possible or not.

1078
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,924
- He doesn't want to come to my party.
- Oh, come. Please.

1079
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:00,253
Please. We would love you to come
for a drink. You and your wife, huh?

1080
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:03,340
Mom, he isn't.
He's not gonna come to my birthday.

1081
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:07,143
You know, I think you've been a wonderful
influence on Rain... almost inspirational.

1082
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:08,595
Well, she's great.

1083
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:12,272
I'd consider it an honor
if you'd come for a birthday drink.

1084
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:15,318
<i>Just as Gabe gave his manuscript to Rain,</i>

1085
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:17,520
<i>Judy also presented some ofher writing.</i>

1086
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:21,984
Listen, um, I finally got around
to reading these lovely poems.

1087
01:00:22,077 --> 01:00:25,115
Oh. You... Oh, you can be
completely honest. I...

1088
01:00:25,205 --> 01:00:27,197
- I am.
- You know, i-it's just a hobby. I...

1089
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:30,454
I was amazed.
They are so full of feeling.

1090
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:32,456
- Really?
- Honestly. What does your husband say?

1091
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:35,539
- Oh, no. I'd never show them to him.
- What?

1092
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,376
He'd be much too critical.
You know, he has very high standards.

1093
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:41,631
- He'd be right too.
- Come on. No, no. Listen.

1094
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,429
The two of you wrote about,
uh, new England. Oh!

1095
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:48,305
There's a little graveyard on Martha's
Vineyard where I'd love to be buried.

1096
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:52,389
I know it, I know it. I used to say to Amy
that's the place I'd choose too.

1097
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,975
- Do you want to have lunch outside today?
- It's so nice. Sure, I'd love to.

1098
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,673
- Gosh, are you soaked?
- No, I'm not so bad.

1099
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,467
- What about you?
- Oh, I think just my coat.

1100
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,466
Your hair's wet.

1101
01:01:24,556 --> 01:01:26,718
- Is it?
- Thank you, Annie. Thank you.

1102
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:29,016
Oh. That was fun, wasn't it?

1103
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,185
Yes. My hair's a mess.

1104
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:35,185
Listen, um... Judy,
can I speak frank with you?

1105
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:39,064
- Sure.
- Thank you for introducing me to Sally.

1106
01:01:39,154 --> 01:01:41,862
Oh. Oh, yeah.

1107
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:45,658
- I think I'm in love with her.
- Gee, that was quick.

1108
01:01:45,744 --> 01:01:49,658
I mean, not that she shares my feelings
or if she ever will, you know?

1109
01:01:49,748 --> 01:01:52,582
- Well, she hasn't been single that long.
- Yeah, yeah.

1110
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,831
I realize that, but it's, like,
I've finally met someone I care about,

1111
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:58,538
and I keep waiting
for the other shoe to fall.

1112
01:01:58,632 --> 01:02:00,544
Well, you, you probably had...
you know,

1113
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:04,218
you're just a little gun-shy
from, maybe, some bad experiences.

1114
01:02:04,304 --> 01:02:07,422
Yeah. Is she as terrific
as she seems?

1115
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,427
She is. She is. She's wonderful.

1116
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:14,763
She's honest and decent, and I,
I can't say enough good things about her.

1117
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:18,099
Oh, thank you, Judy. I've... You know
how much I respect your opinion.

1118
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:20,185
Listen, do you mind if I just, um...

1119
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,519
I'm just feeling a little funny.

1120
01:02:21,613 --> 01:02:23,445
It's probably that run
down the block, you know?

1121
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,864
- I think there's some in the drawer.
- I'm fine.

1122
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,823
I- I don't know why
I introduced Sally to Michael.

1123
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:33,247
Why did I push them together
like that when, uh...

1124
01:02:33,333 --> 01:02:36,542
You know, when obviously
I had feelings for him myself?

1125
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:39,541
So, you know,
I was just very confused.

1126
01:02:39,631 --> 01:02:41,998
I didn't know what I wanted.

1127
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:56,095
You look good.
You don't get any older.

1128
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,431
You have to work out, huh?

1129
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:01,609
You know, since Sally and I
broke up, I'm single.

1130
01:03:01,695 --> 01:03:04,813
- I gotta... gotta watch it, you know?
- I saw Sally the other night.

1131
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:07,444
She's dating some guy.
She introduced us.

1132
01:03:07,534 --> 01:03:10,117
Seemed nice. Nice looking.
Claire could tell you.

1133
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,617
Yeah, I think that...
What was he? He's an editor.

1134
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,619
- Hmm.
- Ah.

1135
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:19,077
- Hmm.
- So, so, I mean, so what's the deal?

1136
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,913
I mean, are they... I mean, is...
Are they seeing one another, or what's...

1137
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:23,919
No, I don't... We don't know.

1138
01:03:24,009 --> 01:03:26,126
I'm drunk so don't
hold me responsible,

1139
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:28,381
but, Jack, you gave up a great one
when you gave up Sally.

1140
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,383
- Ken? Ken?
- Yeah, yeah.

1141
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,556
- He's just having a good time tonight.
- No, he's right.

1142
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,554
He's right, he's right.
I know, I know.

1143
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,354
Look, we were together a lot of years.
She's a great lady. I know.

1144
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,352
I mean, not to worry.
She'll be all right.

1145
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:44,652
- This guy Michael something seemed fine.
- Ken, let's go home.

1146
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,855
Don't tell me I'm out of line.
You're okay, right?

1147
01:03:46,948 --> 01:03:50,692
That blonde girl Samantha, Sam.
She should be in the Olympics.

1148
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,994
Hey, what do you think? I mean,
are they serious about each other?

1149
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,616
- No, we don't know.
- Did she say she's serious?

1150
01:03:55,707 --> 01:03:56,538
What did she say?

1151
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,662
Jack, we didn't talk but for
a few minutes. We just had a...

1152
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,461
She looked great.
Has she had face work?

1153
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,504
- Face work?
- Ken, we have to go.

1154
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,334
- It was good to see you. Let's go home.
- Hey, where is Sam?

1155
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:09,840
If astrology were true,
twins would have the same fate.

1156
01:04:09,929 --> 01:04:14,264
It is true. It is totally, totally,
totally provable, you know?

1157
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:17,389
- From gypsies?
- It is totally logical, right?

1158
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:20,563
Why wouldn't the position of the planets
have an influence on our personalities?

1159
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,638
That's easy to refute.

1160
01:04:21,733 --> 01:04:23,941
Do you know who believes this?
My baby-sitter.

1161
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,940
They know there is more crime
during a full moon, right?

1162
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,192
Well, who knows?

1163
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,276
Well, you know, it's like who?
The universe knows this stuff.

1164
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:37,364
You are all so smart. But it's like you
just don't get the fundamental basics...

1165
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,414
I'd love to get you together
with my baby-sitter.

1166
01:04:39,501 --> 01:04:41,959
- I would love to meet her.
- Hi, sweetheart.

1167
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:44,332
She's been with me two months.
Her father's not around.

1168
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:45,913
We were solving
the secrets of the universe.

1169
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,750
- My ex-wife was a believer.
- You should listen to your wife.

1170
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:52,177
What can I tell you?
I'm just making a point.

1171
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:56,052
Because, you know, the positions
of the planets... it's, like...

1172
01:04:56,142 --> 01:05:00,432
It is crucial to your life. I cannot
stress this strongly enough, you know.

1173
01:05:00,522 --> 01:05:02,434
- And your body and...
- Yeah, but be logical.

1174
01:05:02,524 --> 01:05:06,859
I'm totally logical. I would not put
a Sagittarius with a Libra, right?

1175
01:05:06,945 --> 01:05:09,062
Sam, we gotta go.
Come on. Come on.

1176
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:11,067
- But...
- We're just getting started here.

1177
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,570
- We were having a perfectly nice time.
- Come on. Come on.

1178
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,744
- It's early.
- Come. We'll see you later.

1179
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:19,618
- Come on. Come on.
- It was really nice meeting you.

1180
01:05:19,707 --> 01:05:21,323
- I can't believe you did that.
- Jesus Christ.

1181
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:25,287
If you don't know what you're talking
about, why don't you try not talking?

1182
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,746
They don't know
what they're talking about.

1183
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,047
What do you mean?

1184
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:30,250
You feel so goddamn obligated
to make conversation all the...

1185
01:05:30,343 --> 01:05:31,834
- How about listening?
- Ilisten!

1186
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,920
That's a novel idea for you.

1187
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:37,256
Oh, you are so...
you are so rude, Jack.

1188
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,013
- I can't believe you just did that to me.
- Right, you're the expert.

1189
01:05:40,103 --> 01:05:41,719
Embarrassing.
That is the most embarrassing...

1190
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:42,849
Come on. Let's go.

1191
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,773
Let's get out of here before you
make it any worse, for Christ's sake.

1192
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:52,021
This bullshit all the time about
astrology. It's so stupid. I've told you.

1193
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,731
- There's nothing stupid about it.
- It is.

1194
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,863
I'm so sick of listening to your crap
about soy beans and Zen foods

1195
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,444
and the fuckin' Zodiac.

1196
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:00,746
- Leave me alone. No.
- Hey, get in the car!

1197
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:03,449
- Who do you think you're talking to?
- Hey, listen to me.

1198
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,455
You wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

1199
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:07,662
They're trying to make
an intellectual conversation,

1200
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:10,873
and you're jerking off about tofu
and crystals or something.

1201
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,506
Believe me, they're just stupid.
There's nothing intellectual about them!

1202
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:16,508
- Get in the car.
- No, I'm not going.

1203
01:06:16,598 --> 01:06:18,510
- Yes, you are.
- Help! Help!

1204
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,013
Shut up, will you?
Shut your mouth, will you?

1205
01:06:21,102 --> 01:06:23,219
- What are you, crazy?
- I want to embarrass you.

1206
01:06:23,313 --> 01:06:25,305
You want to embarrass me?
Are you coming with me or not?

1207
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:30,769
No! I hate you and your stupid fucking
asshole, asshole, asshole friends!

1208
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:33,525
Get in the car.
Get your ass in the car right now.

1209
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:35,698
- Where's my bag?
- I don't know where it is.

1210
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:39,151
It doesn't matter where it is.
Here. Get in the car.

1211
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:42,283
Goddamn, I must have been
out of my mind.

1212
01:06:42,373 --> 01:06:44,285
Crazy. You're totally crazy.

1213
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,163
- You're too drunk to drive.
- Oh, bullshit. I'm not drunk.

1214
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,085
Just shut up and let's go,
for Christ's sake.

1215
01:06:49,172 --> 01:06:51,164
Stop. Jack!

1216
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,841
- Goddamn it.
- Look what you've done now!

1217
01:06:54,928 --> 01:06:56,635
Just let me out of here!
Let me out of here!

1218
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,007
No. Hey. Come on.

1219
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,464
- Will you just stop this...
- I'm not stop...

1220
01:07:02,227 --> 01:07:04,594
- Get in the car.
- You maniac!

1221
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,680
- You trying to be cute?
- No!

1222
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:10,107
- Get in the fucking car!
- No, no, no!

1223
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:13,357
- Oh, I don't believe this.
- No, no. Help!

1224
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:16,735
What am I doing?
Get in the car, you infant!

1225
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:19,362
Get in the fucking car!

1226
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,865
Christ Almighty.

1227
01:07:23,957 --> 01:07:25,914
Jesus.

1228
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:51,061
Why were you able to have an orgasm
with Michael and not with your husband?

1229
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,062
I didn't. I was trying to...

1230
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,565
Trying very hard to go with it...
but I was tense.

1231
01:07:55,655 --> 01:07:59,069
- I came close.
- What makes it so difficult for you?

1232
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,069
My mind just gets racing
with thoughts.

1233
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:06,746
You'd laugh if I told you.
I get so mentally hyperactive.

1234
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,790
Like what?

1235
01:08:12,005 --> 01:08:15,089
<i>I thought that I liked
what Michael was doing to me,</i>

1236
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:17,587
<i>and it felt different from Jack...</i>

1237
01:08:17,677 --> 01:08:21,842
<i>More gentle and more exciting.</i>

1238
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:26,350
<i>And I thought how different
Michael was from Jack</i>

1239
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:29,019
<i>and how much deeper
his vision of life was.</i>

1240
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:35,734
<i>And I thought...
Michael was a hedgehog</i>

1241
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,779
<i>and Jack was a fox.</i>

1242
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:44,577
<i>And then I thought... Judy was a fox</i>

1243
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:47,029
<i>and Gabe was a hedgehog.</i>

1244
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:51,246
<i>And I thought about
all the people I knew</i>

1245
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,749
<i>and which were hedgehogs</i>

1246
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,046
<i>and which were foxes.</i>

1247
01:08:57,133 --> 01:09:00,467
<i>Al Simon, a friend, was a hedgehog.</i>

1248
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,216
<i>And his wife Jenny was a hedgehog.</i>

1249
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:06,925
<i>And Cindy Salkind was a fox.</i>

1250
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,977
<i>And Lou Patrino was a hedgehog.</i>

1251
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:16,021
I had the impression that,
at times, you weren't,

1252
01:09:16,110 --> 01:09:18,944
you weren't quite into it.

1253
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:22,239
- Oh, no, no.
- Mmm?

1254
01:09:23,451 --> 01:09:26,489
I mean...

1255
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,866
You know, I...

1256
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:32,825
I told you the problems
I had with Jack, but...

1257
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:35,627
No. It was wonderful.

1258
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:40,879
Oh, God.
I've hurt your feelings, right?

1259
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:44,678
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression. I loved it.

1260
01:09:44,764 --> 01:09:46,721
Me too.

1261
01:09:51,145 --> 01:09:55,515
I used to get really excited
when we first got married.

1262
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,066
Then, somewhere along the line,
it slipped away.

1263
01:09:58,152 --> 01:10:01,270
Hey. It's okay.

1264
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:05,775
What? That I'm not responsive?

1265
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,780
We had a really nice experience.

1266
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:10,863
Yes, but we had two separate,
nice experiences.

1267
01:10:10,957 --> 01:10:13,449
- O-Okay, but they were nice.
- They were separate.

1268
01:10:17,964 --> 01:10:21,924
I'm beginning to see
why your husband got a bit crazy.

1269
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,798
- Very funny.
- Oh, come on, Sally.

1270
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:32,343
- Are you hungry?
- He said, trying to change the subject.

1271
01:10:32,437 --> 01:10:36,056
Oh, stop it.

1272
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,892
What was that?

1273
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:42,444
- There's been a series of burglaries.
- Have you got the alarm on?

1274
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:45,022
- No, no, no, no.
- Well, call the police.

1275
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:47,028
- No, no, no.
- Call the police. I'll take a look.

1276
01:11:00,673 --> 01:11:02,585
<i>- Who are you?
- Who are you?</i>

1277
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,211
Jack! My God!

1278
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,840
You changed the lock
on my own goddamn house.

1279
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:09,421
- Who's this? Who's this?
- This is my husband.

1280
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,507
It's none of your business.
Please leave right now.

1281
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:13,809
- None of my business?
- Are you all right?

1282
01:11:13,895 --> 01:11:16,603
<i>Am I all right?
What the hell... Who are you?</i>

1283
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:19,102
- Is he living here? What's the deal?
- Don't get upset.

1284
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,275
Don't get upset?
What's he doing, fucking in our bed?

1285
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,694
Hey, hey, listen.
Let's not get ugly here.

1286
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:27,068
- This is my house.
- I can talk to him.

1287
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:29,491
- Please, go upstairs.
- Where's he going now, huh?

1288
01:11:29,577 --> 01:11:31,660
- I'll just be up there.
- Yes, I know.

1289
01:11:31,746 --> 01:11:34,454
- Is he going to our bed? Is that the deal?
- It's not our bed anymore.

1290
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:38,284
You need some black coffee.
I'm gonna make it. Then just go.

1291
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,869
Wait a minute. Sally, listen.
I wanna come back.

1292
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:43,376
- Oh, tsk! You're drunk.
- Oh, please.

1293
01:11:43,466 --> 01:11:47,756
Oh, man, my life is such
a fuckin' mess.

1294
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:51,384
Jack, this is not the time
and place to discuss this.

1295
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:54,137
- Please go.
- This is not the place? This is my house!

1296
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:57,720
<i>- Hey, this is my fuckin' house!
- No, it's my fucking house.</i>

1297
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,726
<i>My house now.</i>

1298
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:04,852
- I wanna start over.
- No. That's not possible.

1299
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:07,108
- Too much has happened.
- Oh, God. I made so many...

1300
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:08,359
- Sally, can I help?
- Please.

1301
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,236
Hey, would you get lost?
What is it with him?

1302
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:11,316
Do you mind?

1303
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:14,619
What is he, the guardian here
or something? This is ridiculous!

1304
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,038
- I can handle this.
- Oh, man.

1305
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,036
I don't believe this. I don't believe it.

1306
01:12:19,126 --> 01:12:21,118
Well, you don't have to believe it.
Go.

1307
01:12:21,212 --> 01:12:23,795
You... Listen. I...

1308
01:12:23,881 --> 01:12:25,964
My God. I... Lookit.

1309
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,542
This was not all my fault,
you know? Okay?

1310
01:12:28,636 --> 01:12:30,252
It takes two of us.
Both of us screwed up.

1311
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:31,882
I never said it was your fault.

1312
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:34,056
You don't know
how hard you are to live with.

1313
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:36,508
Oh, please. Have I heard
this before somewhere?

1314
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:40,061
That's it. Perfect. See? She's got
an answer to everything. Everything.

1315
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:44,141
What do you want me to say?
Our marriage was full of problems.

1316
01:12:44,235 --> 01:12:45,851
Yes, I know that.

1317
01:12:45,945 --> 01:12:49,404
You know, some were my fault,
some were yours. But you lied to me.

1318
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:52,278
- Go ahead. Hey.
- You deceived me. You cheated on me.

1319
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:56,738
Why don't you just run upstairs and tell
him there's a stranger in the house.

1320
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,949
- He knows. He knows!
- He knows. Swell. That's perfect too.

1321
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:03,206
Hey, you show me one couple that
doesn't have problems, you know?

1322
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,913
It's not that unusual.
Everybody... It's tough.

1323
01:13:06,007 --> 01:13:08,545
Everybody has a tough time, you know?

1324
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,132
What happened to the one
you moved in with?

1325
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,090
That's bullshit.
It's total bullshit.

1326
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:18,596
Well, I met someone I like.

1327
01:13:18,686 --> 01:13:21,474
What? You what?

1328
01:13:21,564 --> 01:13:23,681
I met someone I like.

1329
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:31,772
<i>What about all the... What about
all the years we had together?</i>

1330
01:13:31,866 --> 01:13:37,737
Well... you know, you had no problem
wiping them out when it suited you.

1331
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:41,289
But I...
I didn't know what to do.

1332
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,332
I didn't know what else to do.

1333
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,503
- I didn't know what to do.
- Oh, no, no! I can't discuss this now!

1334
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,548
Please! Go!

1335
01:13:49,634 --> 01:13:51,546
You know,
you'll feel better tomorrow.

1336
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:55,175
I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow.
That's what I'm gonna feel like.

1337
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:57,176
Oh, shit.

1338
01:13:58,726 --> 01:14:03,187
Hi. Um, I need to...
speak to Jack.

1339
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,559
How long are you just gonna
leave me out there, right?

1340
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:06,731
I told you.

1341
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,981
I have never, never been treated
like this in my life before!

1342
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,529
This is really perfect
how you ruin a life.

1343
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,572
- Then go see a psychiatrist.
- My life!

1344
01:14:14,659 --> 01:14:16,946
God, I need to see a shrink,
dating a slime bag!

1345
01:14:17,036 --> 01:14:19,119
Oh, please! Hey, come on in.
Come on in.

1346
01:14:19,205 --> 01:14:21,367
Why don't you join us?
This is about all of us, you know?

1347
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,244
- We don't have any secrets.
- Bullshit.

1348
01:14:23,334 --> 01:14:24,791
- We have nothing but secrets.
- What do you mean?

1349
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,413
I never met a Scorpio
who wasn't secretive.

1350
01:14:26,504 --> 01:14:29,872
Will you stop with that shit?
Scorpio sh...

1351
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:32,800
I'm going to bed.
Get out. Both of you, get out.

1352
01:14:32,885 --> 01:14:36,754
What's the big deal? I mean,
so I did a couple of things wrong.

1353
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:40,090
I yelled, I misbehaved.
Does it have to be irreversible?

1354
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,974
<i>The heart raged and demanded,</i>

1355
01:14:49,068 --> 01:14:52,436
<i>grew melancholy and confused,
and toward what end?</i>

1356
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:55,944
<i>To articulate what nitwit strategy?
Procreation?</i>

1357
01:14:56,033 --> 01:15:00,198
<i>It told him something... this business
ofhow mind-boggling numbers of sperm</i>

1358
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:02,153
<i>competed for a single egg.</i>

1359
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:05,366
<i>It was not the other way around.
Of course men would make love</i>

1360
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:07,826
<i>at any time and place
with any number of women,</i>

1361
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,709
<i>including total strangers,
while females were more selective.</i>

1362
01:15:11,799 --> 01:15:16,214
<i>They were, in each case, catering
to the demands ofonly one small egg,</i>

1363
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:20,593
<i>while each male had millions
and millions of frantic sperm</i>

1364
01:15:20,683 --> 01:15:24,552
<i>screaming wildly,
"Let us out! Please, let us out now!"</i>

1365
01:15:24,645 --> 01:15:27,888
<i>It was like those desperate ads
in the personals column</i>

1366
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,894
<i>with a dozen requirements and,</i>

1367
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:33,102
<i>if they were not enough,
there was added, "Must be a nonsmoker."</i>

1368
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:37,406
<i>Feldman longed to meet a woman
who attracted him physically</i>

1369
01:15:37,491 --> 01:15:39,403
<i>and had the following personality.'</i>

1370
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,450
<i>a quick sense ofhumor equal to his,</i>

1371
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:45,030
<i>a love ofsports equal to his,
a love of classical music equal to his</i>

1372
01:15:45,124 --> 01:15:48,583
<i>with a particular fondness
for Bach and balmy climates.</i>

1373
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,377
<i>In short, he wanted himself,
but as a pretty woman.</i>

1374
01:15:52,631 --> 01:15:55,339
<i>Pepkin married and raised a family.</i>

1375
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:58,590
<i>He led a warm, domestic life,
placid but dull.</i>

1376
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,797
<i>Knapp was a swinger.
He eschewed nuptial ties</i>

1377
01:16:01,891 --> 01:16:04,224
<i>and bedded five different women a week.</i>

1378
01:16:04,310 --> 01:16:08,600
<i>Students, housewives, nurses,
actresses, a doctor, a salesgirl.</i>

1379
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,477
<i>You name it,
it held Knapp between its legs.</i>

1380
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:15,436
<i>Pepkin, from the calm of his fidelity,
envied Knapp.</i>

1381
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:18,818
<i>Knapp, lonely beyond belief,
envied Pepkin.</i>

1382
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:23,034
<i>What happened
after the honeymoon was over?</i>

1383
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,407
<i>Did desire reallygrow with the years,</i>

1384
01:16:25,498 --> 01:16:29,117
<i>or did familiarity cause partners
to long for other lovers?</i>

1385
01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:33,204
<i>Was the notion ofever-deepening romance
a myth we had grown up on,</i>

1386
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:36,381
<i>along with simultaneous orgasm?</i>

1387
01:16:36,467 --> 01:16:39,710
<i>The only time Rifkin and his wife
experienced a simultaneous orgasm</i>

1388
01:16:39,804 --> 01:16:42,467
<i>was when the judge handed them
their divorce.</i>

1389
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,469
<i>Maybe, in the end,</i>

1390
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,723
<i>the idea was not to expect
too much out of life.</i>

1391
01:16:49,772 --> 01:16:52,139
So, the book was wonderful. It was...

1392
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:55,351
Oh, it was entertaining
and imaginative and moving.

1393
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:57,561
You don't have to say this.
You can be critical and honest.

1394
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:59,817
- Oh, I know, of course.
- Really?

1395
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:03,025
All this suffering and how you
make it so funny, you know?

1396
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,236
All the little lost souls running around.

1397
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,072
That's funny, you know, 'cause I've had
so much trouble with this book.

1398
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,908
- I can't tell you.
- Have you let anybody else read it?

1399
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,163
Oh, not exactly, you know.

1400
01:17:13,254 --> 01:17:15,371
Uh, listen. I'm so thrilled
that you feel this way.

1401
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:18,298
I can't tell you how encouraged I am.
It means so much to me, really.

1402
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:22,799
Your feelings about it are really...

1403
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:23,924
I'm glad.

1404
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:26,301
You are a sucker for my work,
so I shouldn't get excited.

1405
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:29,931
Oh, no. That's not true.
I mean, I'm objective.

1406
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,479
I mean, yes, I do love the way
you write and everything.

1407
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,853
I had some criticisms,
but overall the thing was just...

1408
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:39,482
I'm sure you must have had criticisms,
obviously. You know, what were they?

1409
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:43,031
N- Nothing serious. I mean,
the whole thing was just a delight.

1410
01:17:43,117 --> 01:17:45,029
- Ah, really?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1411
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:47,827
I can't tell you. I've had such
a love/hate relationship with this book.

1412
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:51,953
- Oh, no. Oh, my God. This can't be.
- What's the matter?

1413
01:17:52,042 --> 01:17:55,410
Oh, I think I left
the, um, thing in the cab.

1414
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,837
You're kidding.

1415
01:17:57,923 --> 01:18:01,007
- In a taxicab? Are you sure?
- Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.

1416
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:03,961
I can't believe I did this to you!

1417
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:07,798
- Okay, he was Indian.
- You left it in an Indian's cab?

1418
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:10,134
No. He was Armenian.
I can't believe this.

1419
01:18:10,227 --> 01:18:11,843
That was the only copy.

1420
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,849
- I know. Wait.
- You must be joking. Do... Could...

1421
01:18:13,939 --> 01:18:16,101
Was it Hargopian?
Could that be possible?

1422
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:19,401
Hargopian? Yes. Mr. Hargopian?
Or Swami Hargopian? Or what?

1423
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,923
I was totally crushed. I abs...
You know, I wanted to die.

1424
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:44,877
This was, you know, this was
the worst thing that happened.

1425
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,882
But you put up a false front for her.

1426
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,180
Right. I had to 'cause
the poor girl was wrecked.

1427
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,804
I mean, what was I gonna do?
I was trying to bail her out.

1428
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:53,806
So this book
was very meaningful to you,

1429
01:18:53,896 --> 01:18:56,479
despite all your carrying on
about how you hated it.

1430
01:18:56,565 --> 01:19:00,229
- I guess so.
- And the young woman? Rain?

1431
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:04,939
Her approbation was very significant
to me. I mean, it was, uh...

1432
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:08,150
Well, why was her praise and encouragement
for your work so pleasing?

1433
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:10,076
Judy, your own wife,
had liked it very much,

1434
01:19:10,162 --> 01:19:12,279
and you gave her such a hard time.

1435
01:19:16,043 --> 01:19:19,787
I don't know, but there was
some kind of rapport I felt here

1436
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:22,748
that I thought was,
was meaningful to me.

1437
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:27,586
Hey! Hey!
Somebody found your envelope!

1438
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:30,263
He's waitin' at the house now.
Come here!

1439
01:19:30,349 --> 01:19:34,093
It's... It's so Freudian.

1440
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,099
What is?

1441
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,102
Uh, oh, the whole thing

1442
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:43,060
of leaving the novel in the cab
and everything.

1443
01:19:43,153 --> 01:19:45,861
No, don't be silly.
You know, it could happen to anybody.

1444
01:19:45,948 --> 01:19:47,860
- You misplaced it for a moment.
- No.

1445
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:51,364
I think m-maybe
it meant something.

1446
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,786
- Like what?
- Well, I don't, I don't know.

1447
01:19:56,875 --> 01:20:00,209
I think, maybe,
I could have been threatened.

1448
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,959
- Threatened by my book?
- Yeah.

1449
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,007
- That's abs...
- I mean, I'm very competitive by nature.

1450
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:10,087
- That's absurd.
- Why, because I'm a young female?

1451
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,093
No, don't...
You know, don't get angry.

1452
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:17,177
Because I'm in your corner.
You know, I'm, I'm your biggest fan.

1453
01:20:17,271 --> 01:20:18,307
Yeah.

1454
01:20:21,317 --> 01:20:24,776
I just think that, maybe,
I could have been threatened

1455
01:20:24,862 --> 01:20:26,979
by certain things in the book.

1456
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:29,064
Like what? You know, wh-wh...

1457
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:34,654
Um, some of the attitudes towards
women and your ideas on life.

1458
01:20:34,747 --> 01:20:37,831
- You told me you love the book.
- I do.

1459
01:20:37,916 --> 01:20:40,408
I do love it. Yeah.

1460
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:43,836
- What were your criticisms?
- Um, nothing.

1461
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:45,879
No, tell me. Tell me
what your criticisms were.

1462
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,583
Uh, I was a little disappointed,
I guess,

1463
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,340
with, uh,
with some of your attitudes.

1464
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,389
Like what? What attitudes?

1465
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:55,465
With what?

1466
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,518
The way your people just
casually have affairs like that.

1467
01:20:58,604 --> 01:21:00,721
- That's...
- The book doesn't condone affairs.

1468
01:21:00,814 --> 01:21:03,522
- I'm exaggerating for comic purposes.
- Yeah.

1469
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,521
I mean, but are our choices

1470
01:21:05,611 --> 01:21:09,696
really between chronic dissatisfaction
and suburban drudgery?

1471
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:13,025
No, but, you know, that's how
I'm deliberately distorting it.

1472
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:17,237
I'm trying to show how hard it is
to be married.

1473
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:21,450
Well, you have to be careful not
to trivialize with things like that.

1474
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:23,455
Well, Jesus, I hope I haven't.

1475
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:26,413
Well, the way your lead character
views women...

1476
01:21:26,507 --> 01:21:30,376
It's so retrograde.
It's so shallow, you know?

1477
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:34,258
What are you talk... You told me...
You told me it was a great book.

1478
01:21:34,348 --> 01:21:36,556
Yeah, it's wonderful.
And I never said "great."

1479
01:21:36,642 --> 01:21:39,259
I said it's brilliant and it's alive and...

1480
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:40,844
You know, that's not what I'm...

1481
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:44,102
We're not arguing
about whether it's brilliant or not.

1482
01:21:44,191 --> 01:21:46,103
<i>I'm...
You know, Triumph of the Will.</i>

1483
01:21:46,193 --> 01:21:49,686
It was a great movie,
but you despise the ideas behind it.

1484
01:21:49,780 --> 01:21:52,272
What are you saying now?
You despise my ideas?

1485
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:56,076
No, I don't despise them.
I... That, that example was...

1486
01:21:56,161 --> 01:22:01,953
Okay, isn't it beneath you,
as a mature thinker,

1487
01:22:02,042 --> 01:22:04,455
I mean,
to allow your lead character

1488
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:07,003
to waste so much
of this emotional energy

1489
01:22:07,089 --> 01:22:09,923
obsessing over
this psychotic relationship

1490
01:22:10,008 --> 01:22:12,375
with a woman that you fantasize

1491
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,177
as powerfully sexual and inspired

1492
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:17,756
when, in fact,
she was pitifully sick?

1493
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:20,092
Look, let's stop this right now
because I don't need a lecture

1494
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:22,518
on maturity or writing
from a 20-year-old twit.

1495
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:26,348
You asked me if you could read my book.
I said okay. You told me you loved it.

1496
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,603
And I do.

1497
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,650
Then you leave the fucking thing
in a taxicab.

1498
01:22:29,736 --> 01:22:33,070
And you're weeping, and I'm consoling you.
And suddenly you turn on me.

1499
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:36,616
Okay. I must
have hit a nerve with you.

1500
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,944
Well, yeah. I... You know...

1501
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:42,997
Boy, I'd hate to be your boyfriend.
He must go through hell.

1502
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:45,951
Well, I'm worth it.

1503
01:23:04,188 --> 01:23:07,352
- Did you have trouble finding the house?
- None at all.

1504
01:23:07,441 --> 01:23:10,058
I'm glad. Please, step this way.

1505
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:13,645
Thank you so much. You know,
I can't tell you what this means to me.

1506
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,651
- This is so nice of you.
- That's all right.

1507
01:23:15,741 --> 01:23:16,948
You just found it in a cab?

1508
01:23:17,034 --> 01:23:18,991
Yeah, I jumped in the cab,
and I wound up sitting on it.

1509
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:22,070
I opened the door
and there's this envelope.

1510
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:25,157
- Let me give you something. I wanna...
- Oh, okay. No, no, no.

1511
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,162
- It's okay.
- Really. I can't...

1512
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:29,164
Please, I want you guys
to stay for coffee.

1513
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,166
- You've been too sweet already.
- I won't take no for an answer.

1514
01:23:31,256 --> 01:23:33,794
- She won't take no for an answer.
- She won't. Trust me.

1515
01:23:33,884 --> 01:23:36,126
- Fine. We'll have coffee.
- Good. Great.

1516
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:39,463
- A quick cup of coffee.
- I'm sorry for everything that happened.

1517
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,720
- No, I'm sorry. It was my fault.
- No, it was totally mine.

1518
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,222
Excuse me, Mr. Roth.
If you don't mind my saying,

1519
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:47,679
you got a beautiful daughter
yourself.

1520
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:49,685
Yes, I admit it. Her, her...

1521
01:23:49,775 --> 01:23:54,645
You know, our, our argument
in the cab was, um...

1522
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:58,197
I found attractive
and it attracted me to her in some way.

1523
01:23:58,283 --> 01:24:02,027
You know, that she was not
just a, sort of a passive,

1524
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,863
little, worshipful pupil
or something.

1525
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:08,701
You know, uh, something in me
sensed that, uh...

1526
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:11,036
Not that I was gonna do anything
about it. I certainly wasn't.

1527
01:24:11,129 --> 01:24:14,088
Though... I had,

1528
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:16,541
you know,
certain daydreams about it.

1529
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:19,924
<i>Less than two weeks later,
Jack and Sallygot back together.</i>

1530
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:23,051
<i>This turn of events was celebrated
over dinner with Judy and Gabe.</i>

1531
01:24:23,141 --> 01:24:27,385
Listen, you know, you can't... You just
can't wipe out years of closeness.

1532
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:31,063
I mean, you think you can. You don't
see the roots, but, boy, they're there.

1533
01:24:31,149 --> 01:24:34,517
I think some people are just
not constituted to be single.

1534
01:24:34,611 --> 01:24:38,275
Hey, look. Everybody
screws up, you know? Nobody's perfect.

1535
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:41,403
The question is, do you learn from it?
What do you do then?

1536
01:24:41,493 --> 01:24:45,703
I think the true test of a relationship
is how you weather it in a crisis. Yes?

1537
01:24:45,789 --> 01:24:50,159
Yeah. Everybody looks great, you know,
when everything's going smoothly.

1538
01:24:50,252 --> 01:24:54,417
That's great.
If you can be that mature, it's great.

1539
01:24:54,506 --> 01:24:56,964
It's not that. It's just...
I think you...

1540
01:24:57,050 --> 01:25:01,420
You start finally thinking about
priorities. It's a question of priorities.

1541
01:25:01,513 --> 01:25:04,881
Yeah, I mean, how long can you discuss
physical fitness and the Zodiac?

1542
01:25:04,975 --> 01:25:06,887
Mmm.

1543
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:09,219
Hey, this Michael character
was no bargain. Come on.

1544
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,599
Oh, my God.

1545
01:25:10,689 --> 01:25:13,056
- How was Michael?
- I don't know. He was sick.

1546
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:17,485
He called in sick. So I gave him a call,
and he did sound very terrible.

1547
01:25:17,571 --> 01:25:20,780
- But, I don't know. He had a cold.
- Oh, dear. He's so sweet.

1548
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:23,199
I guess I really pulled
the rug out from under him.

1549
01:25:23,285 --> 01:25:26,198
<i>Although, you know,
his real crush is on Judy.</i>

1550
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:28,371
- Oh, no.
- Not to offend you, Gabe.

1551
01:25:28,457 --> 01:25:32,792
I'm not. I... You know, I love it
when somebody thinks highly of Judy.

1552
01:25:32,878 --> 01:25:35,916
Mmm. G-Gabe needs
confirmation of his feelings.

1553
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:38,919
- Especially when it comes to me.
- That's a terrible thing to say.

1554
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,126
- True. That's true.
- No, no. No, but... No, really.

1555
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:43,632
- I'd watch it if I were you, Gabe.
- Excuse me, please.

1556
01:25:43,722 --> 01:25:46,385
He always talks about Judy
in hushed tones.

1557
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:49,972
I think those poems you wrote
impressed him.

1558
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:53,351
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Here's to a good marriage, huh?

1559
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,352
Mmm.

1560
01:25:55,442 --> 01:25:57,855
Finally, the best
two people can hope for.

1561
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,276
Absolutely.

1562
01:26:11,792 --> 01:26:14,705
I didn't know you were
fooling around with poetry.

1563
01:26:14,795 --> 01:26:16,878
I didn't think
you'd be interested.

1564
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:19,831
- Well, why not?
- Because.

1565
01:26:19,925 --> 01:26:23,214
I'll tell you something.
I'd be embarrassed to show you my stuff.

1566
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:26,171
- Why?
- Because you're so hard on everything.

1567
01:26:26,264 --> 01:26:28,176
- I am not. What are you talking about?
- You are too.

1568
01:26:28,266 --> 01:26:32,431
- You're very, very judgmental.
- I'm not judgmental. I like poetry.

1569
01:26:32,521 --> 01:26:36,856
You know, I'm crazy about Shakespeare
and Byron and T. S. Eliot. You know...

1570
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:39,730
Uh, yeah, well.
My stuff isn't quite that good yet.

1571
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:42,187
Well, I would have given you
an objective evaluation.

1572
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,897
I don't want an objective evaluation,
you know?

1573
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:49,076
I'd like something a little more
supportive. A little more generous.

1574
01:26:49,162 --> 01:26:51,495
You mean like from that character
in your office?

1575
01:26:51,581 --> 01:26:53,823
He's not a "character."

1576
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:56,284
- Are you in love with him?
- No.

1577
01:26:56,378 --> 01:26:58,665
Why, b-because
I've shown a few poems?

1578
01:26:58,755 --> 01:27:01,213
I saw Dr. Ritchie today.

1579
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:05,339
- Oh, where?
- I went back into psychotherapy.

1580
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:09,799
Jesus, you're kidding! You don't need
psychotherapy, and certainly not with her.

1581
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:13,055
You're just threatened by her
because she's postmodern.

1582
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:17,560
Anyone who writes a paper suggesting
the Sabine women had it coming to them...

1583
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,982
- That's not it.
- Jesus.

1584
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:22,606
- I do not flirt!
- Don't tell me you don't flirt,

1585
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:24,983
because I've seen you do it
at parties.

1586
01:27:25,073 --> 01:27:27,736
- You put on a whole other personality.
- Oh, you're crazy!

1587
01:27:27,826 --> 01:27:28,942
Of course you do.

1588
01:27:29,035 --> 01:27:32,369
You get all soulful and pretend
to want things you really can't stand.

1589
01:27:32,456 --> 01:27:35,073
- Like what? What are you talking about?
- Like moving to Europe.

1590
01:27:35,167 --> 01:27:36,624
That's a flirting technique.

1591
01:27:36,710 --> 01:27:39,418
You couldn't survive off the island
of Manhattan for more than 48 hours.

1592
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:43,043
You're the one that misrepresented
herself when we got married.

1593
01:27:43,133 --> 01:27:44,999
- What do you mean? Like what?
- Like what?

1594
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,676
Like you had one child
and you didn't want any more.

1595
01:27:47,763 --> 01:27:49,470
That was the way I felt then.

1596
01:27:49,556 --> 01:27:52,720
People change. I'm not the same
person I was all those years ago.

1597
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:55,643
- That's why relationships go sour.
- Yeah, you hate change.

1598
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:58,392
- Sure I hate... Change equals death.
- What kind of bullshit?

1599
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:00,189
It's death.

1600
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:02,688
Maybe you're fooling
your 20-year-old students into thinking

1601
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:06,192
that's some kind of an insight
or something, but it means nothing.

1602
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:08,398
Change is what life is made of.

1603
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:11,610
If you don't change, you don't grow.
You just shrivel up!

1604
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:13,740
I don't want to make love.

1605
01:28:13,830 --> 01:28:16,413
You always get sexual
at the oddest times.

1606
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,116
What are you so tense for?

1607
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:21,999
You use sex to express
every emotion except love.

1608
01:28:22,088 --> 01:28:24,956
Yeah, you were attracted to me
because, in some way...

1609
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:28,794
And I never figured out how... but
in some way, I reminded you of Harriet.

1610
01:28:28,887 --> 01:28:31,379
But then I disappointed you
because I was too normal.

1611
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,965
I was attracted to you
because you were solid

1612
01:28:34,059 --> 01:28:36,096
and decent
and you were not crazy.

1613
01:28:36,186 --> 01:28:39,850
- Yeah, and you found that too boring.
- No. As it turns out, you...

1614
01:28:39,940 --> 01:28:42,774
In your own quiet way,
you're as crazy as Harriet was.

1615
01:28:42,859 --> 01:28:45,647
<i>- Oh, see? I did remind you of Harriet.
- No, look.</i>

1616
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:46,898
My sixth sense told me...

1617
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:49,947
Some kind of sixth sense said
that you were not stable.

1618
01:28:50,033 --> 01:28:51,820
But on the surface, you were.

1619
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,152
But now that we're having
all kinds of problems, you...

1620
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:57,159
You're not stable. You were
on the surface, but not really.

1621
01:28:57,249 --> 01:28:59,536
This whole thing
is becoming very clear to me.

1622
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:03,165
Uh, w-w-we both couldn't sleep
one night, remember?

1623
01:29:03,255 --> 01:29:07,215
<i>And we found... the movie
of Wild Strawberries</i>

1624
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:10,008
on the cable station
and we stayed up all night watching it?

1625
01:29:10,095 --> 01:29:12,007
- Remember that? That was such a great...
- Yeah.

1626
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,009
For some reason,
a great moment for me.

1627
01:29:14,099 --> 01:29:17,263
Or when we were going
to the faculty dinner and...

1628
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,264
I'll never forget this.
We were on Fifth Avenue,

1629
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,266
and it was just an icy, black night.

1630
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:23,689
We were walking downtown.
You remember that?

1631
01:29:23,775 --> 01:29:26,859
- Suddenly we decided not to go to dinner.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

1632
01:29:26,945 --> 01:29:28,982
We said the hell with it.
It was such a beautiful night,

1633
01:29:29,072 --> 01:29:30,313
We walked into Central Park.

1634
01:29:30,407 --> 01:29:32,820
It was so snowy that night,
and you could see every star.

1635
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,320
Mmm, remember how cold it was?

1636
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:37,950
You were so beautiful
in that black dress. Really.

1637
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,244
- Mmm.
- Don't do that.

1638
01:29:41,334 --> 01:29:43,451
Wh-Why not?

1639
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:46,288
Because it's over,
and we both know it.

1640
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,748
Do we?

1641
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:51,334
Yeah. You know,
all that stuff that...

1642
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:53,636
Those memories.
They're just memories.

1643
01:29:53,722 --> 01:29:57,056
They're, they're, they're
from years gone by.

1644
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:59,225
They're just isolated moments,
you know?

1645
01:29:59,311 --> 01:30:03,225
They don't, they don't tell
the whole, the whole story.

1646
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:07,395
<i>Several days later,</i>

1647
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:09,852
<i>Gabe moved out of his apartment
and into a hotel.</i>

1648
01:30:09,946 --> 01:30:13,610
No, I wasn't being
completely honest with Gabe

1649
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,612
because I didn't want
to hurt him.

1650
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:18,445
But, but I did know what I wanted.

1651
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:20,951
Um, I was in love with Michael,
and I just...

1652
01:30:21,041 --> 01:30:23,784
I wanted to be free
to, um, pursue that

1653
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:29,418
and not have to, not have to lie
or cheat or sneak around or anything.

1654
01:30:29,507 --> 01:30:33,091
How could I be, you know,
a hundred percent honest with Judy?

1655
01:30:33,178 --> 01:30:35,261
I... You know,
I felt that I loved her. And I...

1656
01:30:35,347 --> 01:30:37,259
I didn't want to hurt her.

1657
01:30:37,349 --> 01:30:38,931
So what am I gonna say?

1658
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:43,227
That I feel myself becoming infatuated
with a 20-year-old girl?

1659
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:46,681
And that, you know, I see myself
sleepwalking into a mess

1660
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:48,983
and I've learned nothing
over the years?

1661
01:30:49,069 --> 01:30:51,277
Then why didn't you
stop yourself?

1662
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:55,607
There was something in my marriage
that I craved that I was not getting.

1663
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,569
And Rain... You know, there was a certain
excitement there for me. I don't know.

1664
01:30:59,663 --> 01:31:01,279
- Rain had a boyfriend.
- I know.

1665
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:03,285
Believe me,
everything about it was wrong.

1666
01:31:03,375 --> 01:31:07,585
I know. But, uh,
you know, that did not deter me.

1667
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:11,039
That, if anything, made me,
as usual...

1668
01:31:11,132 --> 01:31:13,249
You know, th-there
was something interesting.

1669
01:31:13,343 --> 01:31:16,552
So what is it?
You have a self-destructive streak?

1670
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:18,550
You know, I don't know.

1671
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:22,600
My heart does not know from logic.
You know, it just...

1672
01:31:22,686 --> 01:31:25,099
I'll get myself one of these.

1673
01:31:25,188 --> 01:31:27,100
- Go ahead.
- I'll get it.

1674
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:32,523
Hello? Oh, Michael, please.

1675
01:31:32,612 --> 01:31:35,605
Look, I... We...
I can't keep discussing this.

1676
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:38,658
I mean, it was a decision
I felt I should make.

1677
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:42,111
No, I wanted to. I'm sorry.

1678
01:31:42,205 --> 01:31:45,448
Look, I can't.
I've said sorry many times now.

1679
01:31:45,542 --> 01:31:48,205
I can't keep discussing this.

1680
01:31:48,294 --> 01:31:52,664
No, I don't want to have a drink.

1681
01:31:52,757 --> 01:31:56,000
I have to go.
Well, you make it hard.

1682
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:58,256
I have to go.

1683
01:31:58,346 --> 01:32:00,303
<i>A week or two passed,</i>

1684
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:03,178
<i>and Judy helped Michael
get over the loss of Sally.</i>

1685
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:08,558
Here we go.

1686
01:32:08,648 --> 01:32:11,015
- Oh, heavens, Judy.
- Pretty good, huh?

1687
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:14,273
That's, that's mine. Where's yours?

1688
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:17,105
- I am so hungry.
- Okay.

1689
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:21,408
- Here.
- Thanks.

1690
01:32:23,621 --> 01:32:26,580
- All right. Shall I be mum? Hey, cheers.
- Cheers.

1691
01:32:26,666 --> 01:32:29,374
- It's a real treat, Judy.
- Oh, you're welcome.

1692
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,386
- Where's your wife? Did she come?
- Uh, no, no.

1693
01:32:49,481 --> 01:32:52,394
To tell you the truth,
we're not together anymore.

1694
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:55,522
Oh, you writers!

1695
01:32:55,612 --> 01:32:57,524
- Happy birthday! Hi, how you doing?
- Hi!

1696
01:32:57,614 --> 01:33:01,984
Did you meet Jessica? Her daughter
and I used to be best friends.

1697
01:33:02,077 --> 01:33:04,069
No, I met Angela, though.

1698
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:06,745
- Gee, did you see that?
- What?

1699
01:33:06,831 --> 01:33:09,448
Incredible this time of year.
It's so beautiful!

1700
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:13,252
- Oh, I love storms.
- It's great to look at it from up here.

1701
01:33:13,338 --> 01:33:16,297
The television said we were
supposed to get the tail end

1702
01:33:16,382 --> 01:33:17,918
of that hurricane off Carolina.

1703
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,217
- Really?
- It's really coming down heavy now.

1704
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:23,296
Oh, it's very fitting.
I was born during a hurricane.

1705
01:33:23,389 --> 01:33:25,426
I really was.

1706
01:33:25,517 --> 01:33:28,476
- It's dangerous out there.
- Wow.

1707
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,473
Wow!

1708
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,683
- She looks so lovely, doesn't she?
- She's having a great time.

1709
01:33:35,777 --> 01:33:39,612
My God. She's 21.
You know, it's absolutely incredible.

1710
01:33:39,697 --> 01:33:43,407
- Our little Rainer, hmm?
- I'm gonna be 55.

1711
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:48,454
Well, you know, it's our 25th
wedding anniversary in June.

1712
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:55,369
Don't worry. We got some light in here.

1713
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:59,457
I know I paid that bill. Take some
of these candles out in the other room.

1714
01:33:59,551 --> 01:34:03,795
- Actually, we'd better just... Can you guys...
- Here we go, here we go.

1715
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:06,847
All right.

1716
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:16,808
I can't believe this.
I know I have a flashlight.

1717
01:34:16,901 --> 01:34:20,315
Oh, this is just my luck
on my own birthday.

1718
01:34:20,405 --> 01:34:21,646
It goes black.

1719
01:34:21,739 --> 01:34:25,107
Hey, you look very, very pretty
in the candlelight.

1720
01:34:27,287 --> 01:34:29,119
Oh, God, did you see
the lightning flashes?

1721
01:34:29,205 --> 01:34:30,195
I'm completely drunk.

1722
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,997
- Mmm!
- It's great. It's great.

1723
01:34:32,083 --> 01:34:33,995
And the wind
is supposed to get worse.

1724
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:36,953
I just don't know how everybody's
gonna get home now.

1725
01:34:37,046 --> 01:34:40,005
Happy birthday.
I've been carrying this around all night.

1726
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:41,957
I didn't want to give it to you
in the other room

1727
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:43,917
because I thought that,
you know, it might...

1728
01:34:44,012 --> 01:34:45,969
people might think
it was funny or something.

1729
01:34:46,055 --> 01:34:50,846
It could be misconstrued, so I've
been hiding it under my jacket for...

1730
01:34:50,935 --> 01:34:53,177
Mmm, yeah, yeah.

1731
01:34:57,775 --> 01:35:00,518
Oh, God, that's lovely.

1732
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:03,730
That is so pretty.

1733
01:35:03,823 --> 01:35:07,316
- Happy birthday.
- Why would it be misconstrued?

1734
01:35:07,410 --> 01:35:10,448
I- I don't... you know. 'Cause I-I-It
would just look funny, I think,

1735
01:35:10,538 --> 01:35:14,077
'cause you have a boyfriend and I give
you this very romantic music box.

1736
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,250
You know, I just didn't want anyone
to get the wrong idea.

1737
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,248
No, it didn't look funny at all.

1738
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:21,126
It's beautiful.

1739
01:35:21,216 --> 01:35:24,880
You know, um...
You know what I'd really like?

1740
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:27,757
What?

1741
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,885
A nice, um, birthday kiss.

1742
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:34,184
- You want a birthday kiss?
- Yeah.

1743
01:35:34,270 --> 01:35:36,887
Birthday kiss.

1744
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:39,974
Happy birthday.

1745
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:42,355
- That's all?
- I'm really drunk. This is not funny.

1746
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:44,653
I know. Mm. So...

1747
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,480
What, why?
What do you mean, "That's all"?

1748
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:48,486
That was a birthday kiss.
What do you want me to do,

1749
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:51,569
bend you back and stick my tongue
down your throat to your shoe tops?

1750
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:55,577
No. Come on.
You know what I mean, don't you?

1751
01:35:55,667 --> 01:35:57,784
I can't give you a birthday kiss.
You're nuts.

1752
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:00,244
- You got a boyfriend in the other room.
- I know.

1753
01:36:00,338 --> 01:36:02,751
That's not serious.
You know, it isn't serious.

1754
01:36:02,840 --> 01:36:04,331
Listen. It's insane.

1755
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,589
I can't even have this conversation.
Not that I haven't thought about it.

1756
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:09,762
- I have thought about it. I have.
- Oh.

1757
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:12,715
But I... You know, I...
It's just too crazy. I...

1758
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:15,927
- That's so disappointing.
- Mm.

1759
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:19,559
Why is it disappointing?
You got... You got a boyfriend.

1760
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:23,609
Because, it's... You couldn't ask
for a more romantic moment.

1761
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:26,438
I mean, it's my 21st birthday,

1762
01:36:26,531 --> 01:36:29,365
and we're in the middle of a storm,
and the lights are out

1763
01:36:29,450 --> 01:36:33,490
and there's... the wind and rain
sweeping the New York skyline.

1764
01:36:33,579 --> 01:36:35,536
Oh, Jesus. Don't do this to me.
Why do I hear...

1765
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:36,989
It's magical.

1766
01:36:37,083 --> 01:36:41,123
$50,000 worth of psychotherapy
dialing 911 now?

1767
01:36:41,212 --> 01:36:42,623
Okay, I'm sorry.

1768
01:36:42,714 --> 01:36:45,502
- I can't. I can't.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm...

1769
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,958
- I've had a little too much to drink too.
- Me too.

1770
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:50,169
- I had a...
- Yeah. I'm just...

1771
01:36:50,263 --> 01:36:53,802
So what do you... You want a kiss?
I mean, you want a real kiss?

1772
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:56,099
- Yeah.
- You want a...

1773
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:58,928
You want an actual,
professional kiss, right?

1774
01:36:59,022 --> 01:37:00,058
Yes.

1775
01:37:00,148 --> 01:37:02,140
Both lips, upper and lower,
simultaneously?

1776
01:37:02,233 --> 01:37:06,773
Yeah, I really... been really
thinking about it, I gotta tell you.

1777
01:37:06,863 --> 01:37:08,775
Come here.

1778
01:37:26,341 --> 01:37:28,333
All I could think of was

1779
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:31,385
I hoped that lightning
can't come into a penthouse

1780
01:37:31,471 --> 01:37:35,010
because I had never been in one before
and it was tumultuous out there.

1781
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:39,469
It was crashing all around, and the scene
just cried out dramatically to be played.

1782
01:37:39,562 --> 01:37:40,894
I mean, she was adorable,

1783
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:44,348
I wanted to kiss her and,
you know, it was pouring rain.

1784
01:37:44,442 --> 01:37:48,186
But there was lightning bouncing around
the terrace and I figured, any second,

1785
01:37:48,279 --> 01:37:51,693
it's gonna come right through the glass
or come right into the apartment,

1786
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:54,150
and, um, and that I would die.

1787
01:37:54,243 --> 01:37:55,779
Judy, leave me be.

1788
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:59,409
I do not want to spend Sunday together,
because I need some time alone!

1789
01:37:59,499 --> 01:38:01,991
So be alone!
I'm certainly not pushing you!

1790
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:05,874
Yes. Yes, you are, in that,
that quiet, steady way of yours.

1791
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:09,297
You're always there for me.
"Supportive" is your word.

1792
01:38:09,384 --> 01:38:12,468
"Understanding." God, stop being
so bloody-well understanding.

1793
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,044
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

1794
01:38:14,138 --> 01:38:16,380
I still think a lot about Sally.
I still have feelings for her...

1795
01:38:16,474 --> 01:38:18,591
feelings I don't think I could
ever have for you.

1796
01:38:18,684 --> 01:38:21,176
Oh, God!

1797
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:23,808
Where are you go...
Oh, shit! Judy!

1798
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:26,140
Judy, I'm sorry.
I'm really so sorry, darling.

1799
01:38:26,234 --> 01:38:28,066
I never want to see you again!
Okay?

1800
01:38:28,152 --> 01:38:29,984
Don't say that.
I need you. I need you.

1801
01:38:30,071 --> 01:38:31,528
It's good to know how
you really feel!

1802
01:38:31,614 --> 01:38:34,231
But I don't feel that way.
I was just upset.

1803
01:38:34,325 --> 01:38:37,068
- You are so selfish and self-centered!
- Please. I am. I know.

1804
01:38:37,161 --> 01:38:38,618
- Nauseating!
- Don't give up on me.

1805
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:39,990
I didn't mean those things.

1806
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,947
What did you say them for
if you didn't mean them?

1807
01:38:42,041 --> 01:38:43,498
Because I'm confused!
I'm upset.

1808
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,247
Lord, I never want to
hurt you again in my life.

1809
01:38:46,337 --> 01:38:48,203
- It's just bullshit!
- It's not bullshit.

1810
01:38:48,297 --> 01:38:49,833
I don't deserve you. I'm sorry.

1811
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:51,836
Please.

1812
01:38:59,016 --> 01:39:03,135
- Did you close all the windows?
- Yeah, I was just thinking that.

1813
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:05,391
It's a good thing
we fixed that leak in the den.

1814
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,440
We'd be swimmin' now. Geez.

1815
01:39:08,526 --> 01:39:12,987
It's crazy, but after all these years,
I'm still scared of thunder.

1816
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:15,314
Any loud noise.

1817
01:39:15,408 --> 01:39:18,947
We would have been absolutely nuts
to use those theater tickets,

1818
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,026
you know that?

1819
01:39:20,121 --> 01:39:22,329
We would have been swerving
all over the road.

1820
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:24,907
- It's a damn good thing we stayed home.
- I'm glad we stayed home.

1821
01:39:25,001 --> 01:39:26,958
Me too.

1822
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:31,084
You know,
when we were separated,

1823
01:39:31,174 --> 01:39:34,508
this is exactly the kind of night
that would have terrified me.

1824
01:39:34,594 --> 01:39:37,632
And I was scared enough
sleeping alone.

1825
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:41,762
You know, sometimes you can be a lot
more alone when you're with somebody.

1826
01:39:41,851 --> 01:39:43,763
Uh-huh.

1827
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:54,312
Do you think we should have given
those other tickets to Gabe or Judy?

1828
01:39:54,405 --> 01:39:56,522
I mean,
we did buy them for them.

1829
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:59,029
Yeah, I know,

1830
01:39:59,118 --> 01:40:01,952
but the situation's
completely different now.

1831
01:40:03,247 --> 01:40:05,204
Right.

1832
01:40:08,544 --> 01:40:11,958
<i>A year and a halflater,
much had occurred.</i>

1833
01:40:12,048 --> 01:40:14,290
<i>Judy was divorced
and married to Michael.</i>

1834
01:40:14,383 --> 01:40:16,875
So, you happy?

1835
01:40:16,969 --> 01:40:19,177
- Go on.
- Yes, yes.

1836
01:40:19,263 --> 01:40:21,880
Yes, I think things have gone
pretty smoothly.

1837
01:40:21,974 --> 01:40:25,217
- Michael puts up with my idiosyncrasies.
- No, no, no.

1838
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,475
It's you... It's she
that puts up with mine.

1839
01:40:28,564 --> 01:40:31,022
Look, I told you.
She's passive/aggressive.

1840
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:33,566
Somehow,
she gets what she wants.

1841
01:40:33,653 --> 01:40:36,771
She wanted me,
she wanted Gabe,

1842
01:40:36,864 --> 01:40:39,481
she wanted the job
at the magazine,

1843
01:40:39,575 --> 01:40:41,487
out of her marriages.

1844
01:40:41,577 --> 01:40:43,409
She wants Michael.

1845
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:48,991
I disagree. No, when Sally
went back to her husband,

1846
01:40:49,085 --> 01:40:51,372
I made a big play for Judy.

1847
01:40:51,462 --> 01:40:55,706
I mean, not at first, but, but...
when I decided, I went after her.

1848
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,213
Yeah, gee, I hope I didn't push.

1849
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:01,716
Yeah, I-I wanted it to work,
it's true.

1850
01:41:01,806 --> 01:41:04,014
We're, you know, we're doin' fine.
We really are.

1851
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:05,136
We're doin' good.

1852
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:08,344
We've learned to tolerate
one another's problems more, I think.

1853
01:41:08,437 --> 01:41:11,771
- Don't you?
- Mmm. And... well, I've learned, anyway,

1854
01:41:11,857 --> 01:41:16,477
that, that love is, is, is not about
passion and romance necessarily.

1855
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:20,861
It's, it's also
about companionship and, um...

1856
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:26,115
You know, it's like a buffer
against loneliness, I think.

1857
01:41:26,205 --> 01:41:30,199
That stuff is really important. It really...
You know, somebody to grow old with.

1858
01:41:30,293 --> 01:41:33,331
I think the thing that's so tough
that kills most people

1859
01:41:33,421 --> 01:41:34,957
is just unreal expectations.

1860
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:36,037
Mm, absolutely.

1861
01:41:36,132 --> 01:41:38,624
What about things
that can't be talked about?

1862
01:41:38,718 --> 01:41:41,426
Like sexual problems, for instance.

1863
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,879
- Well, that's...
- Unresolved.

1864
01:41:43,973 --> 01:41:45,885
Unresolved?

1865
01:41:49,312 --> 01:41:52,430
Well, there-there's some things
you can't solve.

1866
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:55,641
And then you have to live with it.

1867
01:41:55,735 --> 01:41:59,695
You construct some kind
of patchwork thing and, um, it's, uh...

1868
01:41:59,780 --> 01:42:02,488
- But sometimes they flare up.
- They do, and when that happens...

1869
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:05,818
They do. They just... It kind of
gets tough when that happens.

1870
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:07,823
You know,
they're gonna do it.

1871
01:42:07,913 --> 01:42:10,326
But you learn to deal with the problem
and push it back down.

1872
01:42:10,416 --> 01:42:12,282
It's not bad.

1873
01:42:12,376 --> 01:42:14,413
And, you know, it works.
That's the weird thing.

1874
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:16,711
It works okay. It's not bad.

1875
01:42:16,797 --> 01:42:21,417
I mean, you can't force yourself to
conform to some abstract vision of love

1876
01:42:21,510 --> 01:42:25,003
or, or, you know, marriage.

1877
01:42:25,097 --> 01:42:27,384
It's, um...
Every situation's different.

1878
01:42:27,475 --> 01:42:30,468
See, whatever works is the deal.
I mean, everything is gonna be different.

1879
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:32,518
Ours is one way,
somebody else's is another way.

1880
01:42:32,605 --> 01:42:34,722
It's funny.
You know what's funny?

1881
01:42:34,815 --> 01:42:38,183
Last year when we were at Gabe
and Judy's that night.

1882
01:42:38,277 --> 01:42:40,735
And we announced so flippantly
we were splitting.

1883
01:42:40,821 --> 01:42:43,939
- Ridiculous.
- I wasn't feeling that confident inside.

1884
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:45,945
I sure as hell wasn't either.
Stupid.

1885
01:42:46,035 --> 01:42:48,903
I remember envying them so,
thinking they were so lucky.

1886
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,113
They had such a great marriage.

1887
01:42:51,207 --> 01:42:55,577
Yeah, it's ironic that, you know,
we're together and they aren't.

1888
01:42:55,670 --> 01:42:58,378
- Yeah.
- Weird.

1889
01:42:58,464 --> 01:43:01,673
I experienced a very romantic
moment with Rain

1890
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:04,422
at her 21st birthday party,

1891
01:43:04,512 --> 01:43:10,224
and... I could feel...
the old pull coming back.

1892
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:12,676
<i>You know,
the old attraction coming back</i>

1893
01:43:12,770 --> 01:43:15,808
<i>and some feelings that I sensed
from the past in my life.</i>

1894
01:43:15,898 --> 01:43:17,810
<i>It was very vivid to me.</i>

1895
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:27,991
That was a, that was a...
a great moment there,

1896
01:43:28,077 --> 01:43:32,162
but I don't really think
that we should follow up on it.

1897
01:43:33,374 --> 01:43:36,663
Oh, wh-what do you,
what do you mean?

1898
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:40,211
Well, you know. I just... My...

1899
01:43:40,297 --> 01:43:42,505
If things were, you know,
were different...

1900
01:43:42,591 --> 01:43:45,550
If I was younger or,
you know, if you were older

1901
01:43:45,636 --> 01:43:47,844
or anything different, but I just...

1902
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:51,890
Somehow I-I just feel I know
how this is gonna come out.

1903
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:55,803
You sure?

1904
01:43:58,149 --> 01:44:01,313
I am. I, you know, I really am.

1905
01:44:02,403 --> 01:44:04,895
Okay.

1906
01:44:04,989 --> 01:44:06,901
Okay.

1907
01:44:14,248 --> 01:44:16,160
Um...

1908
01:44:17,835 --> 01:44:20,748
mmm, I know
how i-it would end.

1909
01:44:24,008 --> 01:44:26,000
And...

1910
01:44:26,093 --> 01:44:28,756
I left and I walked out
into the pouring rain.

1911
01:44:28,846 --> 01:44:31,088
<i>You know, first I, you know,</i>

1912
01:44:31,182 --> 01:44:33,765
<i>just headed instinctively
back to my apartment</i>

1913
01:44:33,851 --> 01:44:36,594
<i>'cause, you know,
I wanted to hold Judy</i>

1914
01:44:36,687 --> 01:44:38,679
<i>and kiss her
and say things to her.</i>

1915
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:40,856
<i>And, you know, and then...</i>

1916
01:44:40,941 --> 01:44:45,436
<i>Then I realized that,
you know, I really blew it.</i>

1917
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:48,021
So what's your life like now?

1918
01:44:48,115 --> 01:44:52,200
Uh, you know, I'm, I'm out
of the race at the moment.

1919
01:44:52,286 --> 01:44:54,699
I- I-I don't want
to get involved with anybody.

1920
01:44:54,789 --> 01:44:57,782
I- I, um, I don't want to hurt anyone.
I don't want to get hurt.

1921
01:44:57,875 --> 01:44:59,787
I just, you know, I just...

1922
01:44:59,877 --> 01:45:02,995
I don't mind... you know,
living by myself and working.

1923
01:45:03,088 --> 01:45:06,832
I... You know, it's temporary.
I mean, the feelings will pass.

1924
01:45:06,926 --> 01:45:10,090
And then I'll have the urge
to get back into the swing of things

1925
01:45:10,179 --> 01:45:13,263
and, you know, that seems
to be how it goes and...

1926
01:45:13,349 --> 01:45:17,935
But, as I say, I'm, I'm writing.
I'm working on a, uh, a novel...

1927
01:45:18,020 --> 01:45:20,888
A new novel,
not the old one anymore.

1928
01:45:20,981 --> 01:45:24,315
And, um, you know, it's fine.
Absolutely fine.

1929
01:45:24,401 --> 01:45:26,563
- Is it different? Uh...
- My novel?

1930
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:31,149
Yes, it's less, uh, less confessional,
more, more political.

1931
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:33,279
Uh...

1932
01:45:33,369 --> 01:45:35,531
Eh, eh, can I go? Is this over?
