That's it.

123
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:58,710
Listen, soldier,
you should eat something.

124
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,585
Can't.

125
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,543
What do you mean, you can't?

126
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:06,376

Be a Christian, will you?

140
00:11:19,418 --> 00:11:21,543
Tell him to take
the hood off, honey.

141
00:11:22,626 --> 00:11:24,710
How'd you know it was her?

142
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:27,043
I could smell her perfume.

143
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:32,251
See, if we took the hood off,
we'd have to shoot you.

144
00:11:32,376 --> 00:11:35,210
As it is, you got
a fifty-fifty chance.

145
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,585
I thought you liked me,
you bitch.

146
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:40,876
It was fun while it lasted.

147
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,210
Nice lady.

148
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,751
Please, man.

149
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:50,085
I'm suffocating in here.
Take it off.

150
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,335
Can we not take it off?

151
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,293
Have to check with himself.

152
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,418
Here, you mind him.

153
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:02,876

Peter?

156
00:12:13,335 --> 00:12:15,918
- Can I take the prisoner's hood off?
- Why do you wanna do that?

157
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:18,376
- Poor whore's suffocating in the heat.
- So?

158
00:12:18,501 --> 00:12:20,960
- Anyway, he's seen our faces.
- He's seen your face.

159
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,168
Yeah, and he saw Jude as well.

160
00:12:24,793 --> 00:12:25,835
Peter...

161
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,835
If you don't mind him seeing you, I don't
mind, but you're the only one he looks at.

162
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,626
Right. Thanks.

163
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,626
It's your decision.

164
00:12:38,168 --> 00:12:39,918
Leave him to me, Jude.

165
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,710
My pleasure.

166
00:13:08,793 --> 00:13:11,335
Thank you, soldier.

167
00:13:16,376 --> 00:13:18,585
Never thought fresh air
would taste this good.

168
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:25,085
Now, if you loosen my hands,
I could feed myself.

169
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,293
No fucking way.

170
00:13:28,335 --> 00:13:30,085
I'm only joking.

171
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:35,460
You know, I was wrong
about one thing.

172
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,210
- And what's that?
- You're no pin-up.

173
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:44,043
- No?
- No. You're not handsome at all.

174
00:13:44,168 --> 00:13:47,001
- Are you trying to hurt my feelings?
- No.

175
00:13:47,626 --> 00:13:51,460
- It's the truth.
- I could say the same thing about you.

176
00:13:51,585 --> 00:13:52,751
Could you?

177
00:13:52,876 --> 00:13:55,626
But I won't. We're more polite
around these parts.

178
00:13:57,043 --> 00:13:58,585
So I've noticed.

179
00:14:01,793 --> 00:14:03,251
Hey.

180
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,751
What is it now?

181
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,668
You're gonna have to do it,
aren't you?

182
00:14:09,626 --> 00:14:11,335
Do what?

183
00:14:12,168 --> 00:14:13,376
Kill me.

184
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:16,418
What makes you think that?

185
00:14:17,418 --> 00:14:19,501
They're not gonna let that guy out.

186
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,835
And you're gonna have to kill me.

187
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,751
- They'll let him out.
- You want to bet?

188
00:14:25,418 --> 00:14:27,168
I'm not a gambling man.

189
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:30,418
And even if they do...
you can't just let me loose.

190
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,501
Why can't we?

191
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,251
Not your nature.

192
00:14:34,376 --> 00:14:36,251
What do you know
about my nature?

193
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,960
I'm talking about your people,
not you.

194
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,876
What the fuck do you know
about my people?

195
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:46,251
Only that you're all tough,
undeluded motherfuckers,

196
00:14:46,376 --> 00:14:49,293
and it's not in your nature
to let me go!

197
00:14:49,418 --> 00:14:51,168
Shut the fuck up, would you?

198
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,710
You...

199
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:04,835
- You know a funny thing?
- No. What's a funny thing?

200
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:08,460
I didn't even fancy her.

201
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:11,668
Didn't look like that to me.

202
00:15:13,126 --> 00:15:14,876
She's not my type.

203
00:15:15,335 --> 00:15:16,835
No?

204
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:19,085
No.

205
00:15:21,585 --> 00:15:23,751
- Come here.
- No.

206
00:15:23,876 --> 00:15:25,501
Come here.

207
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,626
I wanna show you something.

208
00:15:28,751 --> 00:15:30,210
What?

209
00:15:30,335 --> 00:15:32,376
My inside pocket.

210
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:44,876
Take out my wallet.

211
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,793
Open it.

212
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,376
Inside there's a picture.

213
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,168
No, not that one.
There's another.

214
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:09,918
Now, she's my type.

215
00:16:12,293 --> 00:16:15,501
- She'd be anybody's type.
- Don't you think of it, fucker.

216
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:18,418
- Why not?
- She's mine.

217
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,668
Anyway, she wouldn't suit you.

218
00:16:20,793 --> 00:16:23,501
- No?
- Absolutely not.

219
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,043
She your wife?

220
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:31,626
I guess you could say that.

221
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:33,585
You make a nice couple.

222
00:16:34,918 --> 00:16:36,626
Don't I know it.

223
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:39,210
So what were you
fucking around for then?

224
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:41,668
You fuckers set me up.

225
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,335
That... that bitch.

226
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,418
Uh, uh, uh...

227
00:16:45,543 --> 00:16:47,335
She's a friend of mine.

228
00:16:52,418 --> 00:16:54,126
OK.

229
00:16:54,251 --> 00:16:56,418
That nice lady...

230
00:16:56,543 --> 00:16:58,376
She meets me in a bar.

231
00:16:59,793 --> 00:17:01,501
I'm thinking to myself,

232
00:17:01,626 --> 00:17:04,501
"What the fuck
am I doing here anyway?"

233
00:17:04,626 --> 00:17:07,210
- What the fuck were you doing here?
- I got sent.

234
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:10,001
- You could've said no.
- Can't once I signed up.

235
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:12,710
- Why did you sign up?
- It was a job.

236
00:17:13,668 --> 00:17:15,710
Oh, yeah, a job.

237
00:17:15,835 --> 00:17:18,751
So I get sent to
the one place in the world

238
00:17:18,876 --> 00:17:20,710
where they call you "nigger"
to your face.

239
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:22,793
Shouldn't take it personally.

240
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,418
"Go back to
your banana tree, nigger."

241
00:17:31,043 --> 00:17:33,376
It's no use telling them
I come from Tottenham.

242
00:17:34,251 --> 00:17:37,210
- And you like cricket?
- Best game in the world.

243
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,001
Ever see hurling?

244
00:17:40,126 --> 00:17:42,293
That game where a bunch of paddies
whack sticks at each other?

245
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,085
- Best game in the world.
- Never.

246
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,501
The fastest.

247
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:50,085
Well, in Antigua, cricket's
the black man's game.

248
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:52,501
Kids play it from the age of two.

249
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,376
My dad had me throwing googlies
from the age of five.

250
00:17:56,376 --> 00:17:58,960
Then we moved to Tottenham
and it was something different.

251
00:17:59,085 --> 00:18:01,668
- How was it different?
- Toffs' game there.

252
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,626
But not at home.

253
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:09,043
So, when you come
to shoot me, Paddy,

254
00:18:09,168 --> 00:18:12,751
remember you're getting rid
of a shit-hot bowler.

255
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,876
I'll bear it in mind.

256
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:21,876
Oh, and by the way...

257
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:28,251
It's not "Paddy".
It's Fergus.

258
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,418
Nice to meet you, Fergus.

259
00:18:33,835 --> 00:18:35,751
My pleasure, Jody.

260
00:18:43,668 --> 00:18:46,043
Stay. Wait. Wait!

261
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,418
Take it easy now.
Just go slowly.

262
00:18:49,543 --> 00:18:51,126
- Down by that tree.
- Tree...

263
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:53,626
Tree.

264
00:18:54,126 --> 00:18:55,543
Right.

265
00:18:59,085 --> 00:19:01,126
You've got to loosen my hands.

266
00:19:02,043 --> 00:19:03,376
Can't.

267
00:19:03,501 --> 00:19:05,085
Can't?

268
00:19:06,626 --> 00:19:10,418
Then you're gonna have to take my dick
out for me, aren't you?

269
00:19:12,085 --> 00:19:14,710
Come on, man!
I'm gonna wet my pants!

270
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,293
Take the fucker out, man.
I'm dying.

271
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:42,001
I gotta lean forwards,
or dribble all over myself.

272
00:19:42,126 --> 00:19:43,543
Will you hold my hands for me?

273
00:19:55,835 --> 00:20:00,085
- Now, that is worth waiting for.
- Hurry up, will you?

274
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:02,876
These things take time, Fergus.

275
00:20:05,126 --> 00:20:10,251
It's amazing how these small details
take on such importance, isn't it?

276
00:20:12,126 --> 00:20:13,543
Now put it back in.

277
00:20:15,335 --> 00:20:19,043
- Give us a break.
- I can't do it!

278
00:20:19,168 --> 00:20:22,126
It's only a piece of meat.

279
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:25,626
For fuck's sake,
it's got no major diseases!

280
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:35,168
Thank you.

281
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:39,335
Had a case of the clap
two years ago.

282
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,418
- Crabs in Ulster.
- Shut up, would you?

283
00:20:41,543 --> 00:20:44,376
But, all in all,
it's served me pretty well.

284
00:20:44,501 --> 00:20:48,335
- Get inside, will you?
- I didn't mean to offend you, Fergus.

285
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,710
Fergus.

286
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,626
Yeah?

287
00:20:57,751 --> 00:21:00,960
I'm sorry. I...
I know that wasn't very easy for you.

288
00:21:03,793 --> 00:21:06,335
The pleasure was all mine.

289
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:14,501
Oh, no, it was mine.

290
00:21:15,585 --> 00:21:17,626
Believe me, it was my pleasure.

291
00:21:21,293 --> 00:21:24,210
- What the fuck is this?
- Nothing, man.

292
00:21:24,335 --> 00:21:27,960
- He just took me out for a pee.
- Put the fucking hood on him.

293
00:21:37,085 --> 00:21:38,376
What the fuck is this?

294
00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:40,543
Nothing, he's just got
a sense of humour, that's all.

295
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:44,126
When you're on duty,
you'll keep your fucking mouth shut.

296
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:47,543
- Now go and get some sleep.
- Yeah, get some sleep.

297
00:22:06,335 --> 00:22:08,085
Did he talk?

298
00:22:10,126 --> 00:22:12,001
Didn't make you laugh?

299
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,501
Here, have some breakfast.

300
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,835
Good morning, Fergus.

301
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,710
So he knows your name?

302
00:22:20,335 --> 00:22:21,585
Yeah, I told him.

303
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,043
Are you all there?
Come here.

304
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:26,918
I said come here!

305
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,710
Back in a minute, Jody.

306
00:22:37,251 --> 00:22:39,876
You'll have minimum contact
with that prisoner!

307
00:22:40,001 --> 00:22:41,001
Yeah, OK.

308
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:42,168
- Do you know why?
- Why?

309
00:22:42,293 --> 00:22:44,918
Because tomorrow we might have
to shoot him, that's why.

310
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,501
They giving you trouble, Fergus?

311
00:23:02,251 --> 00:23:03,793
It happens.

312
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:06,876
There's two kinds of people.

313
00:23:07,001 --> 00:23:09,210
Those who give
and those who take.

314
00:23:12,835 --> 00:23:14,626
Take off the hood, man.

315
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,418
It's OK.

316
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:23,585
I understand.

317
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,001
Don't mind
if I prattle on, do you?

318
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,751
I'll take it by your silence
that you don't.

319
00:23:36,376 --> 00:23:38,335
Two types, Fergus.

320
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,460
The scorpion and the frog.

321
00:23:43,251 --> 00:23:45,085
Ever heard of them?

322
00:23:47,668 --> 00:23:51,585
A scorpion wants to cross the river,
but he can't swim.

323
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:56,126
Goes to a frog who can
and asks for a ride.

324
00:23:57,043 --> 00:23:58,335
Frog says,

325
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,918
"If I give you a ride on my back,
you'll go and sting me."

326
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,668
Scorpion replies, "It would not be
in my interest to sting you,

327
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:10,335
"since, as I'll be on your back,
we both would drown."

328
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,001
Frog thinks about this logic for a while
and accepts the deal.

329
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:18,126
Takes the scorpion on his back,
braves the waters...

330
00:24:19,126 --> 00:24:23,918
Half way over
feels a burning spear in his side

331
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:27,751
and realises the scorpion
has stung him after all.

332
00:24:28,418 --> 00:24:32,126
And as they both
sink beneath the waves,

333
00:24:33,293 --> 00:24:35,585
the frog cries out:

334
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,168
"Why'd you sting me,
Mr Scorpion?

335
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,918
"For now we both will drown."

336
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:45,960
The scorpion replies...

337
00:24:48,543 --> 00:24:51,168
"I can't help it.

338
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:53,293
"It's in my nature."

339
00:24:56,085 --> 00:24:58,043
So what's that supposed to mean?

340
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:00,918
It means what it says.

341
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:07,543
A scorpion does
what is in its nature.

342
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,126
Take off the hood, man.

343
00:25:14,918 --> 00:25:16,585
Why?

344
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,293
'Cause you're kind...

345
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,876
...and it's in your nature.

346
00:25:40,168 --> 00:25:43,460
See?
I was right about you.

347
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:45,585
Don't be so sure.

348
00:25:46,585 --> 00:25:48,793
Jody's always right.

349
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,335
Where would you most
like to be now, man?

350
00:25:56,501 --> 00:25:58,126
It doesn't matter where.

351
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,626
Come on, man.

352
00:26:01,501 --> 00:26:03,376
If this shit was all over.

353
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:07,376
Er...

354
00:26:08,376 --> 00:26:10,126
Having a pint in the Rock.

355
00:26:11,668 --> 00:26:13,626
You lack imagination, Fergus.

356
00:26:14,585 --> 00:26:18,043
Think of something more...
alluring.

357
00:26:19,168 --> 00:26:21,085
Like what?

358
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:24,960
Like... having a pint
in the Metro.

359
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,835
Having two pints in the Rock.

360
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Having a pint in the Metro
and Dil's having a margarita.

361
00:26:35,085 --> 00:26:37,876
- Who's Dil?
- A special friend.

362
00:26:38,001 --> 00:26:40,001
Oh, yeah.

363
00:26:40,126 --> 00:26:42,543
We've got simple tastes,
you and me.

364
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,710
Yeah, the best.

365
00:26:47,001 --> 00:26:49,585
But you guys never
get a break, do you?

366
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,710
- Do you?
- Oh, yeah.

367
00:26:52,668 --> 00:26:55,168
We do a tour of duty
and we're finished.

368
00:26:56,501 --> 00:26:59,210
But you guys are never finished,
are you?

369
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:01,626
We don't look on it that way.

370
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,085
Often wonder how you do it.

371
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,126
It depends what you believe in.

372
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:09,793
What do you believe in?

373
00:27:09,918 --> 00:27:11,876
That you guys shouldn't be here.

374
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,376
- That simple?
- Yeah.

375
00:27:17,751 --> 00:27:20,876
- Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
- He's hot!

376
00:27:21,001 --> 00:27:23,460
Doesn't matter if he's hot.
Just cover the fucker up.

377
00:27:23,585 --> 00:27:25,668
You've got no feelings, woman!

378
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:28,001
You... shut your face!

379
00:27:31,043 --> 00:27:33,501
- You're heading for trouble, Fergus.
- OK, OK.

380
00:27:34,376 --> 00:27:36,251
He's a good soldier.

381
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,335
I said shut the fuck up.

382
00:27:43,043 --> 00:27:45,835
- He believes in the future.
- Is that right?

383
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,376
Is it bad?

384
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:18,626
Not bad.

385
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,501
Women are trouble.

386
00:28:24,626 --> 00:28:27,418
- Do you know that, Fergus?
- I didn't.

387
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:32,418
Some kinds of women are.

388
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,376
She can't help it.

389
00:28:38,668 --> 00:28:43,960
Dil, she was no trouble,
no trouble at all.

390
00:28:44,793 --> 00:28:46,126
You liked her?

391
00:28:46,251 --> 00:28:49,418
Present tense, please, please.

392
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:52,751
Love her...

393
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,668
...wherever she is.

394
00:28:58,418 --> 00:28:59,960
I'm thinking of her now.

395
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:02,960
Would you think of her, too?

396
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,626
I don't know her.

397
00:29:08,043 --> 00:29:09,710
I want you
to do something for me.

398
00:29:10,293 --> 00:29:11,543
What?

399
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,710
If they kill me...

400
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,543
Don't think that way.

401
00:29:16,668 --> 00:29:18,168
But they will.

402
00:29:19,043 --> 00:29:20,960
As sure as night follows day.

403
00:29:21,085 --> 00:29:22,835
They have to.

404
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,793
I want you to find her out.

405
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:29,668
Tell her I was thinking of her.

406
00:29:30,918 --> 00:29:32,668
See if she's all right.

407
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,710
I don't know her.

408
00:29:36,668 --> 00:29:38,460
Take her picture. It's...

409
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:42,210
Come here.
It's in my inside pocket.

410
00:29:48,335 --> 00:29:50,668
Take the whole lot.
I won't need it.

411
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:53,085
I told you not to talk that way.

412
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:59,085
Go to Millie's Hair Salon
in Spitalfields.

413
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,960
Take her to the Metro
for a margarita.

414
00:30:05,251 --> 00:30:06,724
You don't have to tell her who you are.

415
00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:08,442
You just tell her Jody
was thinking of her...

416
00:30:08,543 --> 00:30:10,126
Stop it.

417
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:29,043
Volunteer!

418
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:33,085
We need you inside.

419
00:30:50,751 --> 00:30:52,418
We've heard word.

420
00:30:53,376 --> 00:30:56,835
They've used every trick in the book
on him and he's beginning to talk.

421
00:30:58,835 --> 00:31:00,460
You're gonna have
to do it in the morning.

422
00:31:06,251 --> 00:31:07,751
You OK about that?

423
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:10,960
- I'm a volunteer, aren't I?
- Good.

424
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:13,793
Beginning to have my doubts
about you over the past few days.

425
00:31:13,918 --> 00:31:15,793
- Not the only one.
- Shut up, Jude.

426
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:20,210
Better get some sleep
tonight, Fergus.

427
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,626
Peter.

428
00:31:23,501 --> 00:31:24,876
What?

429
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:27,626
Request permission to guard
the prisoner tonight.

430
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:31,085
- You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
- Shut the fuck up, Jude.

431
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:34,793
- What do you want to do that for?
- It would make me feel better about it.

432
00:31:36,585 --> 00:31:38,335
Sure about that?

433
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:40,001
Yeah, I'm sure.

434
00:31:41,918 --> 00:31:43,251
OK.

435
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,918
You're a good man, Fergus.

436
00:31:56,126 --> 00:31:57,793
Don't.

437
00:31:57,918 --> 00:31:59,710
I... I'm sorry.

438
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:07,418
Help me.

439
00:32:10,501 --> 00:32:11,835
How can I?

440
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,710
I don't know.

441
00:32:15,043 --> 00:32:16,793
I don't know.

442
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:22,001
Just help me.

443
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:28,876
Give me a cigarette.

444
00:32:46,585 --> 00:32:49,335
I don't even...
I don't even smoke.

445
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:55,043
Thought it was
the right thing to do.

446
00:33:08,835 --> 00:33:11,335
- Go to sleep now.
- I don't want to sleep.

447
00:33:13,335 --> 00:33:15,335
Tell me something.

448
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,335
- What?
- A story.

449
00:33:20,126 --> 00:33:22,835
- Like the one about the frog?
- And the scorpion.

450
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:25,626
No... no!

451
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,376
Tell me anything.

452
00:33:30,335 --> 00:33:32,626
- "When I was a child...
- Yeah?

453
00:33:36,126 --> 00:33:38,210
"I thought as a child.

454
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:42,876
"But when I became a man...

455
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:45,710
"I put away childish things."

456
00:33:48,793 --> 00:33:50,668
What does that mean?

457
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:54,668
Nothing.

458
00:33:54,793 --> 00:33:56,376
Nothing?

459
00:33:57,876 --> 00:33:59,710
Tell me something.

460
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:02,751
Anything.

461
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,585
Not a lot of use,
are you, Fergus?

462
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:18,168
Me?

463
00:34:20,835 --> 00:34:22,418
No.

464
00:34:23,543 --> 00:34:25,501
I'm not good for much.

465
00:34:55,543 --> 00:34:57,293
Come on, stand up.

466
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:02,626
Turn to your right.

467
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:06,168
OK, step up. One step.

468
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:10,543
OK, turn to your right.

469
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:13,168
Go forward. Step up.

470
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:22,585
Now to the left.

471
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,585
I wish to say on behalf of
the Irish Republican Army...

472
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:30,085
Leave him be!

473
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,210
Take the hood off, Fergus.

474
00:35:48,043 --> 00:35:49,460
No.

475
00:35:51,043 --> 00:35:54,251
I want to see a bit, please.
Please.

476
00:35:54,376 --> 00:35:56,585
Don't make me die
like an animal.

477
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,043
I'm glad you're doing it.

478
00:36:13,835 --> 00:36:15,960
Do you know that, Fergus?

479
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:17,543
Why?

480
00:36:17,668 --> 00:36:19,501
'Cause you're my friend.

481
00:36:20,418 --> 00:36:22,918
And I want you to go
to the Metro.

482
00:36:23,043 --> 00:36:25,043
Stop that talk now!

483
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:29,376
Hurling's a fast game,
isn't it, Fergus?

484
00:36:29,501 --> 00:36:30,710
The fastest.

485
00:36:30,835 --> 00:36:33,418
- Faster than cricket?
- Cricket's in a ha'penny place.

486
00:36:33,543 --> 00:36:36,835
So if I ran, there's no way
I could beat you, is there?

487
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,376
- You won't run!
- But if I did...

488
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:42,501
you wouldn't shoot
a brother in the back.

489
00:36:42,626 --> 00:36:44,085
Jody!

490
00:36:45,835 --> 00:36:49,251
- You stupid bastard!
- What'd you say, faster?

491
00:36:49,376 --> 00:36:52,210
- I said you bastard, stop!
- Gotta catch me first.

492
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,126
Used to run the mile, you know,
four times around the cricket pitch.

493
00:36:57,001 --> 00:36:58,210
What was that game called?

494
00:36:58,335 --> 00:36:59,501
- Hurling!
- What?

495
00:36:59,626 --> 00:37:00,876
- Hurling!
- What?

496
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:06,043
Told you I was fast, man.

497
00:37:13,376 --> 00:37:15,001
Don't do it.

498
00:37:21,126 --> 00:37:22,210
Jody!

499
00:37:29,043 --> 00:37:31,126
All line up! Follow me!

500
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:45,793
Over here now!

501
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:48,376
Jude! Run!

502
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:23,626
Fergus.

503
00:38:24,584 --> 00:38:26,501
You're back on the bike, Tommy?

504
00:38:29,293 --> 00:38:31,418
- How are you keeping?
- All right.

505
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:33,876
You'll notice
I've asked you nothing.

506
00:38:35,168 --> 00:38:36,793
That's wise, Tommy.

507
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:39,126
All right then.
I like being wise.

508
00:38:43,459 --> 00:38:45,168
So what do you need, Fergus?

509
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:49,668
- Need to go across the water.
- Do you now?

510
00:38:50,876 --> 00:38:52,626
Need to lose myself for a while.

511
00:38:52,751 --> 00:38:54,251
Aye.

512
00:38:55,584 --> 00:38:58,043
There's a man I know
ships cattle to London.

513
00:40:30,959 --> 00:40:32,668
We're closing.

514
00:40:34,584 --> 00:40:36,459
You deaf?

515
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:39,084
- I'll see you tomorrow, Dil.
- 'Night.

516
00:40:40,293 --> 00:40:43,376
- Do you want something in particular?
- Er, just a bit of a trim.

517
00:40:44,084 --> 00:40:45,418
Come on.

518
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:06,043
- Someone recommended you?
- In a way.

519
00:41:06,168 --> 00:41:07,918
Who?

520
00:41:08,043 --> 00:41:10,834
Er... a guy I work with.

521
00:41:10,959 --> 00:41:12,543
What's his name?

522
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:16,668
- Does the water not get to your nails?
- What's it to you?

523
00:41:16,793 --> 00:41:17,834
Nothing.

524
00:41:20,376 --> 00:41:22,501
- You American?
- No.

525
00:41:22,626 --> 00:41:24,626
- You're not English.
- No.

526
00:41:25,459 --> 00:41:27,126
Scottish?

527
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:28,834
How did you guess?

528
00:41:28,959 --> 00:41:30,459
The accent, I suppose.

529
00:41:30,584 --> 00:41:33,168
Oh. What's it like?

530
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,626
Like treacle.

531
00:41:39,501 --> 00:41:41,793
Nice laugh.

532
00:41:49,918 --> 00:41:52,376
There. That should
make her happy.

533
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:55,959
Who's she?

534
00:41:56,084 --> 00:41:57,959
Don't know. Who is she?

535
00:42:33,251 --> 00:42:34,751
Hi, Dil.

536
00:42:35,626 --> 00:42:37,001
Hiya, hon.

537
00:42:37,876 --> 00:42:40,126
- All right?
- Not so bad.

538
00:42:43,626 --> 00:42:46,168
- Yes? What'll it be?
- Bottle of Guinness.

539
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:49,251
Bottle of Guinness.

540
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,959
- See that, Col?
- See what, Dil?

541
00:42:54,084 --> 00:42:56,751
- He gave me a look.
- Did he?

542
00:42:56,876 --> 00:42:59,293
- I've just cut his hair, you know.
- Yeah?

543
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:01,834
- So what do you think?
- Nice.

544
00:43:07,043 --> 00:43:08,959
There.
He did it again.

545
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:11,084
- I saw that one.
- And what would you call that?

546
00:43:11,209 --> 00:43:12,626
Now that was a look.

547
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:16,293
Ask him to ask me
what I'm drinking.

548
00:43:16,418 --> 00:43:18,543
She wants to know do you want
to know what she's drinking.

549
00:43:18,668 --> 00:43:20,543
A margarita.

550
00:43:27,459 --> 00:43:29,209
Now he can look.

551
00:43:33,543 --> 00:43:35,376
Ask him does he
like his hair, Col.

552
00:43:36,501 --> 00:43:39,376
She wants to know, sir,
do you like your hair.

553
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:43,043
- Tell her I'm very happy with it.
- He's Scottish, Col.

554
00:43:44,168 --> 00:43:46,043
- Scottish?
- Yeah.

555
00:43:46,168 --> 00:43:48,668
- What did he say?
- He agreed that he was.

556
00:43:50,126 --> 00:43:52,584
And what do you think
his name might be?

557
00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:55,084
I've no thoughts on the subject.

558
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,418
- Jimmy.
- Jimmy?

559
00:43:57,543 --> 00:43:59,834
Jimmy.
That's what he said.

560
00:44:00,334 --> 00:44:01,793
Hiya, Jimmy.

561
00:44:03,043 --> 00:44:04,459
Hiya, Dil.

562
00:44:08,793 --> 00:44:10,793
- Sing us a song, Dil.
- Fuck off, Dave.

563
00:44:10,918 --> 00:44:14,334
Come on, babe.
You know what I like.

564
00:44:14,459 --> 00:44:15,668
Easy!

565
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:27,918
'Ere, where d'you think
you're fucking going then?

566
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:30,959
Piss off, Dave.
Get off my case!

567
00:44:31,084 --> 00:44:32,668
Fucking cow!

568
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:46,168
I fucking hate this violet tone.

569
00:44:46,293 --> 00:44:48,459
- Go on, get in there!
- Stop pushing.

570
00:44:49,668 --> 00:44:51,709
This is the last time.

571
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:41,501
- One run!
- Come on!

572
00:45:46,001 --> 00:45:48,126
So, Pat's a cricket fan, is he?

573
00:45:49,168 --> 00:45:51,793
It's not Pat. It's Jim.

574
00:45:51,918 --> 00:45:55,001
Yes, well, I don't actually give a fuck
whether it's Jim, Pat or Mick,

575
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:57,876
as long as you remember
you're not at Lord's, all right?

576
00:46:07,001 --> 00:46:08,751
There you go.

577
00:46:08,876 --> 00:46:13,001
- So, I see you're a regular, sir.
- Is that good or bad?

578
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,626
Well...

579
00:46:15,751 --> 00:46:19,084
You get to say, "The usual, Col",
things like that.

580
00:46:22,418 --> 00:46:23,918
Here.

581
00:46:24,751 --> 00:46:27,168
- Let's call this the usual.
- Thanks.

582
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,126
- No, no. It's on me.
- Thanks very much.

583
00:46:33,709 --> 00:46:36,209
You can take it out if you want.

584
00:46:38,418 --> 00:46:40,501
Came to see her, didn't you?

585
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:42,876
Listen, there's something
I should tell you. She's...

586
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:46,626
- She's what?
- She's on.

641
00:50:34,543 --> 00:50:37,876
- Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt!
- Charming.

642
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:39,626
- What'll I do?
- Break his neck.

643
00:50:40,543 --> 00:50:42,376
No, don't.

644
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:44,918
He's gonna take his foot off
slowly, David.

645
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:48,918
Then you're to go home
like a good boy. You hear?

646
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:51,126
Cunt.

647
00:50:53,334 --> 00:50:55,168
Come on, honey.

648
00:51:01,376 --> 00:51:04,084
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

649
00:51:05,209 --> 00:51:06,876
What was all that about?

650
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:09,751
He wants me
to 'perform' for him.

651
00:51:10,668 --> 00:51:13,168
- Perform?
- You know.

652
00:51:14,626 --> 00:51:16,418
You on the game?

653
00:51:16,543 --> 00:51:19,293
God, no.
I'm a hairdresser.

654
00:51:21,293 --> 00:51:23,543
He's getting up.

655
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:26,751
Can't leave me then, can you?

656
00:51:43,043 --> 00:51:45,709
- You want me to ask you in, right?
- No. Didn't say that.

657
00:51:45,834 --> 00:51:50,043
But I'm not cheap, you know that?
Loud, but never cheap.

658
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:52,584
Oi!

659
00:51:54,209 --> 00:51:56,376
You fucking dumb dyke
carrot cunt!

660
00:51:58,001 --> 00:52:00,543
If you kissed me,
it would really get his goat.

661
00:52:16,668 --> 00:52:18,918
Now, if you asked me
to meet you tomorrow,

662
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:21,293
it would really drive him insane.

663
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:26,126
- Where?
- Half-five at Millie's.

664
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:43,293
Give me that look again.

665
00:52:43,418 --> 00:52:46,293
- What look?
- The one you gave me in the Metro.

666
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,793
Darling, you shouldn't have.

667
00:52:57,043 --> 00:52:59,459
- What's that about?
- They're jealous.

668
00:52:59,584 --> 00:53:01,834
- Why?
- I wonder.

669
00:53:17,918 --> 00:53:20,251
Now's the time you're meant
to do something, isn't it?

670
00:53:21,126 --> 00:53:24,126
- Like what?
- Make a pass or something.

671
00:53:24,251 --> 00:53:26,001
Isn't that the way it goes?

672
00:53:26,793 --> 00:53:28,543
Must be.

673
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:35,043
Have you got a special friend,
Jimmy?

674
00:53:35,168 --> 00:53:37,543
- How special?
- Do you want one?

675
00:53:37,668 --> 00:53:39,834
Jesus Christ!

676
00:53:41,084 --> 00:53:42,959
Jesus.

677
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:46,168
That Dave?

678
00:53:46,293 --> 00:53:48,459
The things
a girl has to put up with.

679
00:53:50,584 --> 00:53:53,084
I'm frightened, Jimmy.
That's not like him.

680
00:53:58,418 --> 00:54:00,334
Piss off, Dave!

681
00:54:02,918 --> 00:54:04,543
Tough guy, huh?

682
00:54:05,668 --> 00:54:08,126
Are you gonna be all right
on your own?

683
00:54:08,251 --> 00:54:10,543
But I'm not on my own, am I?

684
00:54:22,043 --> 00:54:24,043
It won't hurt you to come in.

685
00:54:27,626 --> 00:54:30,209
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

686
00:54:30,334 --> 00:54:32,501
- What'll it be?
- Er, whiskey.

687
00:54:38,709 --> 00:54:40,209
Yeah! Hey!

688
00:54:41,501 --> 00:54:44,709
- Come on, Dil!
- Somebody out there.

689
00:54:44,834 --> 00:54:46,959
Jesus fucking Christ!

690
00:54:48,001 --> 00:54:50,126
Hey, Dil!

691
00:54:51,376 --> 00:54:55,334
- Oi, Stirling fucking Moss!
- It's Dave!

692
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:59,043
- Come on, Dil, talk to me!
- Sure, Dave.

693
00:54:59,168 --> 00:55:01,584
Come on! Hey, Dil...

694
00:55:02,251 --> 00:55:05,168
- Hey, they're my clothes!
- Take your clothes...

695
00:55:05,293 --> 00:55:07,543
Don't throw my clothes
out the window!

696
00:55:07,668 --> 00:55:09,543
Fuck off back to Essex!

697
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:11,793
Fucking mad!

698
00:55:13,084 --> 00:55:15,168
Don't chuck my clothes out!

699
00:55:18,043 --> 00:55:20,501
Take your fucking goldfish, too!

700
00:55:22,459 --> 00:55:24,293
My fucking fish!

701
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:30,751
Murderer!

702
00:55:35,668 --> 00:55:37,043
Sorry.

703
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:40,793
How did he drive
with his neck in a brace?

704
00:55:40,918 --> 00:55:43,001
Must be in love to manage that.

705
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:45,334
Doesn't know the meaning
of the word.

706
00:55:46,626 --> 00:55:48,751
Did he live here with you?

707
00:55:48,876 --> 00:55:50,418
He tried to.

708
00:55:52,209 --> 00:55:53,876
Sit down, will you?

709
00:55:55,168 --> 00:55:56,793
What about him?

710
00:55:58,626 --> 00:56:00,293
He was different.

711
00:56:01,834 --> 00:56:03,543
How different?

712
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:05,793

as it's possible to be.

719
00:56:46,168 --> 00:56:49,584
- You want to know how I kissed him?
- Yes.

And don't call me that.

878

- Probably.

- You can always pretend.

01:11:40,793 --> 01:11:42,668
Absolutely.

887
01:11:43,418 --> 01:11:45,876
Won't be quite the same,
though, will it?

888
01:11:46,001 --> 01:11:48,084
Are you pretending yet?

889
01:11:48,209 --> 01:11:49,876
I'm working on it.

890
01:11:52,834 --> 01:11:54,959
There's Dave.

891
01:11:55,084 --> 01:11:57,626
- He knew, too.
- Stop it, Jimmy.

892
01:11:57,751 --> 01:11:59,668
Am I becoming repetitious?

893
01:12:01,168 --> 01:12:03,168
- A little.
- Sorry.

894
01:12:04,959 --> 01:12:07,959
- No, don't ask me in.
- Please, Jimmy.

895
01:12:08,084 --> 01:12:09,793
No.

896
01:12:09,918 --> 01:12:12,501
I can't pretend that much.

897
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:15,251
- I miss you, Jimmy.
- Yeah?

898
01:12:15,376 --> 01:12:18,251
- Should have stayed a girl.
- Don't be cruel.

899
01:12:21,459 --> 01:12:23,126
OK.

900
01:12:24,126 --> 01:12:26,418
Be a good girl, go inside.

901
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:29,918
Only if you kiss me.

902
01:12:41,584 --> 01:12:44,584
- Now you happy?
- Delirious.

903
01:12:57,459 --> 01:12:59,418
Hello, stranger.

904
01:13:01,209 --> 01:13:02,918
You vanished.

905
01:13:05,001 --> 01:13:06,918
What was it, Fergus?
Did you blow the gaff on us,

906
01:13:07,043 --> 01:13:08,626
or did you just fuck up?

907
01:13:10,918 --> 01:13:12,668
Leave me alone, Jude.

908
01:13:13,543 --> 01:13:15,709
No. That's the last thing I'll do.

909
01:13:25,668 --> 01:13:28,626
- You never asked what happened.
- I heard.

910
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:31,001
- Eddie and Tinker died.
- I know.

911
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:34,459
Maguire and me got out
by the skin of our teeth.

912
01:13:34,584 --> 01:13:36,334
No thanks to you.

913
01:13:39,251 --> 01:13:41,043
What do you think of the hair?

914
01:13:41,751 --> 01:13:44,126
- Suits you.
- Aye.

915
01:13:44,251 --> 01:13:46,209
I was sick of being a blonde.

916
01:13:48,251 --> 01:13:51,293
I needed a tougher look,
if you know what I mean.

917
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:04,459
Fuck me, Fergus.

918
01:14:07,834 --> 01:14:10,084
Am I to take it that's a no?

919
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:15,334
We had a court-martial
in your absence.

920
01:14:16,334 --> 01:14:18,459
They wanted to put
a bullet through your head.

921
01:14:18,584 --> 01:14:20,918
I pleaded for clemency.

922
01:14:21,043 --> 01:14:23,251
Said we should find out
what happened first.

923
01:14:25,084 --> 01:14:27,084
So what did happen?

924
01:14:28,168 --> 01:14:30,126
He ran.

925
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:32,126
I couldn't shoot him in the back.

926
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:34,876
I tried to catch him.

927
01:14:36,126 --> 01:14:38,584
He made it to the road
and got hit by a Saracen.

928
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:42,376
So you did fuck up.

929
01:14:43,043 --> 01:14:44,459
Yes.

930
01:14:44,584 --> 01:14:47,084
But you know what
the thing is, Fergus?

931
01:14:48,084 --> 01:14:49,918
No, what is the thing?

932
01:14:50,793 --> 01:14:53,209
You vanished quite effectively.

933
01:14:53,918 --> 01:14:55,626
Became Mister Nobody.

934
01:14:56,168 --> 01:14:59,126
You've no idea
how useful that could be.

935
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:02,459
- What do you mean?
- We've got some plans here.

936
01:15:03,126 --> 01:15:06,084
And we'll need a Mister Nobody
to execute them.

937
01:15:06,209 --> 01:15:08,751
No way, Jude. I'm out.

938
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:11,043
You're never out, Fergus.

939
01:15:13,459 --> 01:15:15,876
Maybe you don't care
about yourself, but...

940
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:19,293
Consider the girl, Fergus.

941
01:15:21,793 --> 01:15:24,668
- The wee black chick.
- Leave her out of this!

942
01:15:24,793 --> 01:15:27,918
Jesus, Fergus!
You're a walking cliché.

943
01:15:28,043 --> 01:15:30,043
You know we won't
leave her out of it.

944
01:15:31,584 --> 01:15:33,626
But I'm glad to see you care.

945
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:37,251
And I must admit...

946
01:15:38,168 --> 01:15:40,501
- I'm curious.
- What the fuck do you know, Jude?

947
01:15:40,626 --> 01:15:42,918
You fucking tell me, boy!

948
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:47,376
She's nobody.
She likes me.

949
01:15:49,043 --> 01:15:51,709
Oh, so I suppose a fuck
is out of the question.

950
01:15:53,584 --> 01:15:56,501
You keep your head down, Fergus.

951
01:15:56,626 --> 01:15:58,626
No sudden moves.

952
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:00,793
And not a whisper to her.

953
01:16:02,084 --> 01:16:04,001
You'll be hearing from us.

954
01:16:08,209 --> 01:16:10,084
Keep the faith.

955
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:31,918
He your boyfriend?

956
01:16:35,543 --> 01:16:37,501
Lucky you.

957
01:16:41,043 --> 01:16:43,043
Carnations.

958
01:16:43,168 --> 01:16:45,543
- What?
- He'd bring me carnations.

959
01:16:46,334 --> 01:16:49,501
- Oh, so I got it wrong, huh?
- Not at all, honey.

960
01:16:49,626 --> 01:16:51,793
- Don't.
- OK.

961
01:16:57,959 --> 01:17:00,334
- Come on. Come on.
- Why, honey?

962
01:17:00,459 --> 01:17:02,543
- You gonna tell me why?
- No.

963
01:17:06,543 --> 01:17:08,668
What's wrong, Jimmy?
You gonna tell me what's wrong?

964
01:17:08,793 --> 01:17:10,543
No, not here.

965
01:17:22,501 --> 01:17:24,251
Are you gonna tell me what it is?

966
01:17:24,376 --> 01:17:27,501
- Yeah, what is it?
- You know her, Jimmy?

967
01:17:27,626 --> 01:17:30,334
Jimmy, is it?
Do you know me, Jimmy?

968
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:32,626
- Dil, this is Jude.
- You following me?

969
01:17:32,751 --> 01:17:35,168
Yeah! Just checking.

970
01:17:36,293 --> 01:17:39,751
- Is he being nice to you, Dil?
- Ever so nice. Aren't you, Jimmy?

971
01:17:39,876 --> 01:17:43,668
That's good. I'm glad.

972
01:17:43,793 --> 01:17:47,668
- Young love, as they say.
- Absolutely. The younger the better.

973
01:17:48,459 --> 01:17:50,834
Doesn't come your way much,
I suppose.

974
01:17:50,959 --> 01:17:55,293
- Don't go looking for it, Dil.
- Well, maybe you'll get lucky someday.

975
01:17:55,751 --> 01:17:58,001
Bit heavy on the powder,
isn't she, Jimmy?

976
01:17:58,126 --> 01:18:01,251
- A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
- Oh, absolutely.

977
01:18:02,543 --> 01:18:04,168
As long as she can keep it.

978
01:18:05,459 --> 01:18:08,001
Isn't that right, James?

979
01:18:17,168 --> 01:18:18,959
It's her, isn't it?

980
01:18:19,084 --> 01:18:20,334
What's her?

981
01:18:20,459 --> 01:18:22,793
She's the thing
you had to tell me.

982
01:18:23,501 --> 01:18:25,251
Kind of.

983
01:18:25,959 --> 01:18:29,626
I'm sorry, you know that?
I'm really sorry.

984
01:18:31,834 --> 01:18:34,834
- You see that, Col?
- Saw it, Dil.

985
01:18:34,959 --> 01:18:37,834
- Fuck it is what I say.
- Yeah, fuck it, Dil.

986
01:18:37,959 --> 01:18:39,876
Fucking men, Col.

987
01:18:40,001 --> 01:18:41,584
Fuck 'em.

988
01:18:42,459 --> 01:18:44,584
Fuck you, Jimmy!

989
01:19:04,543 --> 01:19:06,418
You could always
make it up to her.

990
01:19:06,543 --> 01:19:08,209
How?

991
01:19:08,834 --> 01:19:11,668
When a girl runs out like that,
she generally wants to be followed.

992
01:19:13,043 --> 01:19:14,834
She's not a girl, Col.

993
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:17,001
Whatever you say.

994
01:19:31,334 --> 01:19:35,084
She went that way.
But you come with me.

995
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,043
So, it was you all the time.

996
01:20:07,168 --> 01:20:09,084
Who'd you think it was?

997
01:20:09,209 --> 01:20:11,043
I thought it was Dave.

998
01:20:12,043 --> 01:20:14,043
And who's Dave
when he's at home?

999
01:20:14,709 --> 01:20:16,334
He's at home.

1000
01:20:17,501 --> 01:20:20,293
- Should blow you away, you know that.
- Yeah, I know.

1001
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:25,001
I'm getting emotional, and I don't like
getting fucking emotional!

1002
01:20:25,626 --> 01:20:28,126
You understand, Hennessy?

1003
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:30,918
- Yeah. I understand.
- Fuck you, too.

1004
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:32,251
Fuck you.

1005
01:20:32,918 --> 01:20:36,334
Ah, leave him alone, Peter.
He's in love.

1006
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:39,584
- That right, Fergus? You in love?
- Absolutely.

1007
01:20:39,709 --> 01:20:41,668
And what's she like
between the sheets?

1008
01:20:41,793 --> 01:20:44,376
- Definitely unusual.
- And who is she?

1009
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:46,709
Just a girl.

1010
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,543
You know what'll happen
if you fuck up again, don't you?

1011
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:54,126
- Aye, I do, Peter.
- Good.

1012
01:21:07,501 --> 01:21:10,251
- So, what do you think that is, Hennessy?
- A hotel?

1013
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,834
It's a knocking shop.
Très discreet, huh?

1014
01:21:17,709 --> 01:21:20,334
He visits his ladies
Tuesdays and Thursday nights.

1015
01:21:20,459 --> 01:21:23,376
And Saturday mornings.
That's his security in the car beyond.

1016
01:21:27,376 --> 01:21:28,459
Who is he?

1017
01:21:28,584 --> 01:21:30,959
Doesn't matter who he is.
He's a legitimate target.

1018
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:32,209
Thank God for that.

1019
01:21:33,459 --> 01:21:36,209
- Trying to be cynical, Hennessy?
- Hope not.

1020
01:21:36,334 --> 01:21:38,793
Good.
So, what do you think?

1021
01:21:45,751 --> 01:21:49,084
Whoever hits him will be hit,
if those men are any good.

1022
01:21:51,209 --> 01:21:54,126
- And I presume you can't get inside.
- Right.

1023
01:21:54,668 --> 01:21:57,043
- So it's on the street?
- Right.

1024
01:21:58,376 --> 01:21:59,834
Kind of suicide, isn't it?

1025
01:22:02,293 --> 01:22:04,959
But then, I don't have a choice.

1026
01:22:05,084 --> 01:22:07,543
Och, you do, Fergie.

1027
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:11,334
Of course. I forgot.

1028
01:22:13,126 --> 01:22:15,084
Come on.

1029
01:22:15,209 --> 01:22:17,084
Rehearsal.

1030
01:22:28,751 --> 01:22:31,001
You keep your mind
on your job, boy.

1031
01:22:31,793 --> 01:22:34,709
- And then you'll leave her out of it?
- Aye. Then we'll leave her be.

1032
01:22:39,584 --> 01:22:43,334
He's arthritic. Takes him two minutes
to get to the door.

1033
01:22:45,834 --> 01:22:49,876
- And what if I say no?
- You know what. Go.

1034
01:23:08,918 --> 01:23:10,709
Pardon me, young man!

1035
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:23,751
- You were made for this.
- Was I?

1036
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:26,251
- Perfect!
- What happens then?

1037
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,751
We'll be on the other side.
We'll move when you do.

1038
01:23:28,876 --> 01:23:30,709
And what if you don't?

1039
01:23:30,834 --> 01:23:34,001
- Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
- You may be right.

1040
01:23:35,709 --> 01:23:39,126
Stay late at your work tomorrow night
and I'll bring you the gear.

1041
01:23:40,334 --> 01:23:42,293
- Jude.
- Yes?

1042
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,043
Who is the old geezer?

1043
01:23:46,293 --> 01:23:48,168
Some judge.

1044
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:05,459
- Why'd you follow me, Dil?
- I was jealous, Jimmy.

1045
01:24:05,584 --> 01:24:08,251
- You shouldn't be.
- Why shouldn't I be jealous?

1046
01:24:11,209 --> 01:24:13,293
Don't. My make-up.

1047
01:24:21,293 --> 01:24:22,793
She own you, Jimmy?

1048
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:24,959
Yes.

1049
01:24:25,084 --> 01:24:26,793
She's from Scotland, too?

1050
01:24:27,834 --> 01:24:29,334
Yeah, you could say that.

1051
01:24:29,459 --> 01:24:31,418
And you're not gonna tell me more?

1052
01:24:32,043 --> 01:24:33,668
I can't.

1053
01:24:43,168 --> 01:24:45,084
What you doing, Jimmy?

1054
01:24:48,459 --> 01:24:50,418
I don't know yet.

1055
01:24:52,918 --> 01:24:55,084
Do you like me even a little bit?

1056
01:24:59,334 --> 01:25:01,168
More than that.

1057
01:25:04,834 --> 01:25:06,876
Come on, let's go for a walk.

1058
01:25:08,668 --> 01:25:10,751
Do something for me, Dil?

1059
01:25:10,876 --> 01:25:12,709
Anything.

1060
01:25:12,834 --> 01:25:14,501
You'd do anything for me?

1061
01:25:15,418 --> 01:25:17,126
Afraid so.

1062
01:25:17,251 --> 01:25:19,334
Have you got the keys
to the shop?

1063
01:25:31,584 --> 01:25:33,293
You want another haircut, Jimmy?

1064
01:25:34,418 --> 01:25:35,834
No.

1065
01:25:35,959 --> 01:25:37,751
Come on, sit down.

1066
01:25:45,251 --> 01:25:47,001
You'd do anything for me?

1067
01:25:48,334 --> 01:25:49,876
Anything.

1068
01:25:51,584 --> 01:25:54,126
- No way.
- You said anything, Dil.

1069
01:25:54,251 --> 01:25:56,751
A girl has to
draw the line somewhere.

1070
01:25:58,209 --> 01:26:00,918
- I want to change you to a man.
- Why?

1071
01:26:01,959 --> 01:26:03,418
It's a secret.

1072
01:26:05,043 --> 01:26:07,543
Would you like me
better that way, Jimmy?

1073
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:09,126
Yes.

1074
01:26:09,251 --> 01:26:11,418
- And you wouldn't leave me?
- No.

1075
01:26:11,543 --> 01:26:14,043
- You promise?
- I promise.

1076
01:26:17,126 --> 01:26:19,001
Go on, then.

1077
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:44,918
- You want to make me like him.
- No.

1078
01:26:45,043 --> 01:26:46,918
I want to make you
into something new...

1079
01:26:48,084 --> 01:26:49,959
...that nobody recognises.

1080
01:27:04,418 --> 01:27:06,751
I don't recognise myself.

1081
01:27:10,001 --> 01:27:12,668
No.
Better in the dark.

1082
01:27:13,876 --> 01:27:16,043
- So it's true, then.
- What?

1083
01:27:17,209 --> 01:27:19,543
- You like me better like this.
- Yes.

1084
01:27:31,918 --> 01:27:34,251
No, no. Dil. Dil.
Come on.

1085
01:27:36,126 --> 01:27:37,876
Dil.

1086
01:27:54,043 --> 01:27:55,834
Turn round, turn round.

1087
01:28:02,334 --> 01:28:04,126
Baby.

1088
01:28:09,168 --> 01:28:11,043
What you doing, honey?

1089
01:28:11,168 --> 01:28:12,751
Don't call me that.

1090
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:14,459
Sorry.

1091
01:28:14,584 --> 01:28:17,584
- What you doing?
- Try this on.

1092
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,876
- Why?
- For me.

1093
01:28:20,834 --> 01:28:23,043
- For you.
- Yes.

1094
01:28:30,584 --> 01:28:33,626
- What we doing here, Jimmy?
- Look on it like a honeymoon.

1095
01:29:46,001 --> 01:29:47,834
You a handyman, Fergie?

1096
01:29:48,834 --> 01:29:51,126
Take a pride in my work.

1097
01:29:51,793 --> 01:29:53,668
I sincerely hope so.

1098
01:30:11,376 --> 01:30:13,251
Tools of the trade.

1099
01:30:19,959 --> 01:30:21,918
And forget about the girl.

1100
01:30:34,084 --> 01:30:35,834
Dil!

1101
01:30:46,209 --> 01:30:47,918
Dil!

1102
01:30:50,293 --> 01:30:51,751
Dil!

1103
01:30:52,584 --> 01:30:54,543
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1104
01:30:54,668 --> 01:30:57,501
- I'm going home!
- I told you to stay in the hotel!

1105
01:30:57,626 --> 01:30:59,209
I thought you were fooling me.

1106
01:30:59,334 --> 01:31:01,918
- I thought you were leaving me!
- I had to go to work!

1107
01:31:02,043 --> 01:31:05,376
I stayed all day in that hotel
thinking every noise was you!

1108
01:31:05,501 --> 01:31:06,709
Come on.

1109
01:31:06,834 --> 01:31:08,709
There's something
you're not telling me, Jimmy.

1110
01:31:08,834 --> 01:31:12,834
- Come on!
- No! I'm going home.

1111
01:31:12,959 --> 01:31:15,709
- Dil!
- So tell me!

1112
01:31:16,501 --> 01:31:19,043
- I was trying to get out of something!
- No!

1113
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,126
Tell me everything, Jimmy!

1114
01:31:22,168 --> 01:31:25,543
You... You got to forget
you ever saw me, Dil.

1115
01:31:25,668 --> 01:31:27,209
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1116
01:31:28,793 --> 01:31:30,293
Stop it, would you?

1117
01:31:31,709 --> 01:31:34,043
Give it over, Dil,
for fuck's sake!

1118
01:31:37,668 --> 01:31:40,584
I'm sorry.
I get nervous.

1119
01:31:40,709 --> 01:31:42,709
I've got this blood condition.

1120
01:31:42,834 --> 01:31:45,459
Just help me inside, Jimmy,
and I'll be all right.

1121
01:31:59,876 --> 01:32:02,126
Did you hear what I said, Dil?

1122
01:32:14,501 --> 01:32:16,084
Get my pills.

1123
01:32:18,793 --> 01:32:22,001
- What pills?
- Prescription for my condition.

1124
01:32:22,126 --> 01:32:23,876
What condition?

1125
01:32:24,001 --> 01:32:27,084
My condition. Ennui.

1126
01:32:37,376 --> 01:32:39,876
Are you supposed
to take that many?

1127
01:32:40,001 --> 01:32:42,751
Only in times of extreme stress.

1128
01:32:48,168 --> 01:32:50,418
See, they all say
goodbye sometime.

1129
01:32:50,918 --> 01:32:52,251
Except for him.

1130
01:32:53,043 --> 01:32:54,293
Are you all right, Dil?

1131
01:32:54,418 --> 01:32:56,168
I will be.

1132
01:32:58,293 --> 01:33:00,043
Go on.

1133
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:03,626
Goodbye, Dil.

1134
01:33:07,334 --> 01:33:08,918
Jimmy?

1135
01:33:10,584 --> 01:33:11,626
What?

1136
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:13,459
Don't go like that.

1137
01:33:16,793 --> 01:33:18,584
I can't help what I am.

1138
01:33:36,709 --> 01:33:38,709
I knew you had a heart.

1139
01:33:43,709 --> 01:33:47,584
Dil, can I tell you something?

1140
01:33:48,459 --> 01:33:50,709
I knew your man.

1141
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:53,001
You knew which man?

1142
01:33:53,126 --> 01:33:56,293
- Your soldier.
- You knew my Jody?

1143
01:33:58,334 --> 01:34:01,168
Lifted him from a carnival
outside Belfast.

1144
01:34:02,501 --> 01:34:04,876
Held him hostage for three days.

1145
01:34:05,918 --> 01:34:08,084
You knew my Jody?

1146
01:34:08,209 --> 01:34:10,501
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

1147
01:34:13,043 --> 01:34:15,084
Got the order to shoot him.

1148
01:34:16,834 --> 01:34:19,001
Before I could do it, he ran.

1149
01:34:20,376 --> 01:34:22,793
Ran into a tank and died.

1150
01:34:22,918 --> 01:34:24,376
Died?

1151
01:34:24,501 --> 01:34:25,876
Did you hear me?

1152
01:34:26,001 --> 01:34:27,668
You killed my Jody?

1153
01:34:28,834 --> 01:34:30,626
In a manner of speaking.

1154
01:34:31,584 --> 01:34:33,168
It was you.

1155
01:34:33,293 --> 01:34:35,043
You should scream.

1156
01:34:36,293 --> 01:34:38,668
You should beat my head off.

1157
01:34:45,376 --> 01:34:47,626
- You killed my Jody?
- No.

1158
01:34:49,584 --> 01:34:52,043
You didn't?

1159
01:34:52,168 --> 01:34:55,626
- I suppose I tried.
- You tried?

1160
01:34:56,168 --> 01:34:57,959
Don't you want to kill me?

1161
01:35:01,834 --> 01:35:03,626
Bang!

1162
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:12,043
Don't leave me tonight.

1163
01:35:12,918 --> 01:35:14,793
Might kill me, too.

1164
01:35:16,751 --> 01:35:18,584
OK.

1165
01:36:28,793 --> 01:36:30,834
What the fuck?

1166
01:36:31,459 --> 01:36:33,834
So tell me what you're doing,
Jimmy.

1167
01:36:59,626 --> 01:37:02,168
I didn't really listen last night.

1168
01:37:02,293 --> 01:37:04,543
I heard, but I didn't listen.

1169
01:37:07,418 --> 01:37:09,501
That won't do you no good.

1170
01:37:09,626 --> 01:37:11,626
Dil knows how to tie a body.

1171
01:37:16,001 --> 01:37:18,376
I wondered why you
came on to me like that.

1172
01:37:19,418 --> 01:37:23,084
- When you gave me the look.
- He asked me to see were you all right!

1173
01:37:38,834 --> 01:37:42,334
See, I fix on anyone
who's nice to me.

1174
01:37:42,459 --> 01:37:45,293
Just the littlest bit nice -
I'm all yours.

1175
01:37:45,418 --> 01:37:47,001
Stop it, Dil!

1176
01:37:47,126 --> 01:37:49,584
Just don't kick Dil
and she'll be touched.

1177
01:37:51,043 --> 01:37:53,709
Be nice to her
and she'll be yours forever.

1178
01:37:57,834 --> 01:38:00,126
See, I should
blow you away, Jimmy.

1179
01:38:01,084 --> 01:38:03,376
But I can't... yet.

1180
01:38:04,376 --> 01:38:06,293
- Let me go, Dil.
- Why?

1181
01:38:06,418 --> 01:38:08,001
I gotta be somewhere!

1182
01:38:08,918 --> 01:38:10,793
So try and go then.

1183
01:38:17,293 --> 01:38:19,001
Where the fuck is he?

1184
01:38:19,126 --> 01:38:21,168
Christ!

1185
01:38:22,626 --> 01:38:27,418
Let me go, for fuck's sake, Dil,
or they'll be here.

1186
01:38:27,543 --> 01:38:29,084
Let them come then.

1187
01:38:29,793 --> 01:38:32,334
Can't stay here, Peter.
Drive round once more.

1188
01:38:34,043 --> 01:38:38,501
See, I just want your company
for a little while longer.

1189
01:38:46,043 --> 01:38:49,418
- That fucker's dead.
- No. We are.

1190
01:38:49,543 --> 01:38:51,876
You don't know
what you're doing, Dil.

1191
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:54,834
I never did.

1192
01:39:04,168 --> 01:39:08,084
- Shit! Give me the shooter.
- What? You're crazy!

1193
01:39:08,209 --> 01:39:11,626
- Give me the fucking shooter, Jude!
- Peter!

1194
01:39:12,876 --> 01:39:14,959

Yeah, I like you, Dil.

1200
01:40:23,126 --> 01:40:25,918
Give me a bit more, baby.
A bit more.

1201
01:40:27,084 --> 01:40:29,668
- More what?
- More endearments.

1202
01:40:31,209 --> 01:40:33,459
- I like you, Dil.
- Love me.

1203
01:40:34,501 --> 01:40:36,834
- Yeah.
- Tell me you love me.

1204
01:40:37,709 --> 01:40:40,334

I love you, Dil.

01:40:45,126 --> 01:40:46,459
You do?

1207
01:40:48,501 --> 01:40:50,334
Yeah.

1208
01:40:52,043 --> 01:40:54,043
What would you do for me?

1209
01:40:55,959 --> 01:40:57,584
Anything.

1210
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:00,543
Say it again.

1211
01:41:02,459 --> 01:41:04,376
I'd do anything for you, Dil.

1212
01:41:18,876 --> 01:41:21,334
And you'd never leave me?

1213
01:41:22,959 --> 01:41:24,626
Never.

1214
01:41:25,543 --> 01:41:29,376
I know you're lying, Jimmy,
but it's nice to hear it.

1215
01:41:35,043 --> 01:41:36,918
I'm sorry.

1216
01:41:45,584 --> 01:41:47,334
You stupid shit!

1217
01:41:48,959 --> 01:41:52,501
- Once was bad enough, but twice?
- You didn't knock, honey.

1218
01:41:55,543 --> 01:41:58,251
- Dil!
- Get that thing off me, Fergus!

1219
01:41:58,376 --> 01:41:59,668
What was that
she called you, Jimmy?

1220
01:41:59,793 --> 01:42:01,376
- Fergus!
- What's Fergus?

1221
01:42:01,501 --> 01:42:04,126
- It's my name, Dil!
- So, what happened to Jimmy?

1222
01:42:04,251 --> 01:42:06,418
I said get her off me!

1223
01:42:06,543 --> 01:42:09,043
What's she gonna do, Jimmy?
She gonna blow you away?

1224
01:42:09,626 --> 01:42:10,668
Dil!

1225
01:42:10,793 --> 01:42:12,668
Was she there too
when you got my Jody?

1226
01:42:12,793 --> 01:42:14,751
- Dil!
- I asked you a question, honey.

1227
01:42:14,876 --> 01:42:16,709
Were you there, too?

1228
01:42:16,834 --> 01:42:17,959
You sick bitch.

1229
01:42:19,293 --> 01:42:21,543
- Dil!
- You was there, wasn't you?

1230
01:42:21,668 --> 01:42:23,918
You used those tits and that arse
to get him, didn't you?

1231
