1
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:34,344
-Oh, my God!
-Frank, thank God! l'm dead.

2
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,306
l'm dead.

3
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:44,521
Frank, l'm sorry. l got lost.
This town is so confusing.

4
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,904
What a day.
My wife had to work early.

5
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:58,368
My kid was crying when l took him to
schooI. He hated to leave Chicago.

6
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:04,249
-lt broke my heart, Frank.
-Any more excuses?

7
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:09,671
-No.
-Good. ln the future be punctual.

8
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,885
-You got it?
-l'm sorry. lt won't happen again.

9
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,904
-Frank, how are you doing?
-lt's good to see you again.

10
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:39,785
-Hi, Marty. Sorry we're late.
-Al, go help Jimmy and Raul.

11
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,915
Yeah, sure. This is his.

12
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:54,091
-You don't trust me?
-l live in a crappy neighborhood.

13
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,971
-Have you got that funny money?
-Yeah. Right here.

14
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:04,810
lt looks good. lt looks real good.

15
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:10,399
-We're in business.
-ExcelIent.

16
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:15,237
There's just one problem.
This guy Al....

17
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:20,784
He keeps asking all these questions
about my counterfeiter.

18
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:25,289
My instinct usually teIls me
when something's wrong.

19
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:30,711
And there's something wrong.
So l had him foIlowed.

20
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,798
He's a Secret Service agent, Frank.

21
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:55,986
-What do you think l ought to do?
-Be sure the body doesn't wash up.

22
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,366
l want you to pop him for me, okay?

23
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:09,291
-l think maybe you're with him.
-You came to me, remember?

24
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:14,129
-So pop him. Show me l'm an asshoIe.
-l'm just a businessman.

25
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:16,214
So pop him...

26
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:19,384
...and let's do some business.

27
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,322
Yes, Frank, that's what l'm looking for.

28
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,286
Come on, let's go get an omeIet.

29
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,208
Let me get my pistol.

30
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,044
My gun?

31
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,052
You're under arrest.

32
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,064
You're under arrest, too.
Secret Service.

33
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:23,907
You knew from the weight
of the gun that it was empty, right?

34
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:28,412
There couId have been
one buIlet there.

35
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,125
Hey, Frank.

36
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:39,631
Do you think we can go someplace
and taIk about this?

37
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,686
You killed guys before, Frank?

38
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,523
Does it get to you?

39
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,734
lt gets to you.

40
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:05,991
l don't like this undercover stuff.
l was so scared.

41
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,914
l joined the Secret Service...

42
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,794
...to protect people.

43
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:21,798
You like the idea of
throwing yourself in front of a gun?

44
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:26,303
Hoping you get hit instead of
the guy you're protecting?

45
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:33,143
l don't know. Maybe l'm....

46
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,484
-Maybe l'm just wrong for the job.
-You're a good man, AI.

47
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:45,947
-You'll make a good agent.
-How do you know?

48
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,995
l know things about people.

49
00:06:53,955 --> 00:07:00,629
-Come on, let's eat.
-l've got to go home to my family.

50
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:06,051
A lot of guys warned me
you were a pain in the ass.

51
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,222
-l'll see you in the office.
-Damn! The office.

52
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:15,977
-Monroe wants us to check this out.
-l'll take care of it.

53
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,982
-l'll go with you.
-No. Go hug your wife and kid.

54
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:32,869
l was not snooping,
but the smoke alarm was going off.

55
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,456
l got scared.

56
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:42,254
l got more scared
when l saw what was inside.

57
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,179
The smoke was from crumbs
in the oven he left on.

58
00:08:18,582 --> 00:08:21,751
Thirty-one years
l've been in this country.

59
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,506
l love the United States.
l've been to the White House.

60
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:33,638
Only in the United States can just
anybody go to visit the President.

61
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:38,727
So when l saw this,
these killing things...

62
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,815
...l called the police.
They called the Secret Service.

63
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,902
That was two days ago.

64
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:55,285
The President gets 1 ,400 threats
a year. We've got to check them all.

65
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,924
-You say his name's McCauley?
-No, McCrawley, from Denver.

66
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:18,558
l remember it Iike yesterday.
l cried and cried.

67
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:03,395
Joseph McCrawIey, Denver.

68
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:08,024
Died over 30 years ago, age 1 1 .

69
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,527
Your guy got
a duplicate birth certificate...

70
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:13,405
...then used it to get a driver's license.

71
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,701
-Thanks, Jack.
-See you.

72
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,874
Federal Agents. Open up!

73
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:21,931
Oh, my God! That's you.

74
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:34,671
-Yeah?
-Frank Horrigan?

75
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:39,509
-Yeah?
-The Secret Service agent?

76
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:44,681
-Yeah. What did l win?
-My God, it's really you?

77
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:50,687
-Who the hell is this?
-That was you in my apartment.

78
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:02,157
-McCrawley?
-Why not call me Booth?

79
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:06,870
-Why not OswaId?
-Booth had flair and panache.

80
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,541
The leap to the stage
after he shot Lincoln.

81
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,797
-Where are you?
-Closer than you'd imagine.

82
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:22,427
It's very exciting to talk to you.
I feel like I know you.

83
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:27,807
I've read about you and seen photos.
You were JFK's favorite agent.

84
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:32,395
But that was a long time ago.
What keeps you going?

85
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,940
Let's get together and talk.

86
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:40,111
I think the less you know about me,
the better.

87
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:46,034
-l'm planning to kill the President.
-You shouldn't have said that.

88
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:51,039
Threatening the President is a federal
offense, even if you don't mean it.

89
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,917
l mean it.

90
00:13:54,083 --> 00:14:00,924
One need only be willing to trade
one's own life for the President's.

91
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,762
-That's right.
-l'm willing.

92
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:11,142
Going up against you raises
the game to a much higher level.

93
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,648
Fate has brought us together, Frank.

94
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:23,112
-l just can't get over the irony.
-What irony?

95
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:28,409
Your intimate involvement with
the assassinations of two presidents.

96
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,460
Hang on a second.
l've got something on the stove.

97
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:12,829
He was a tenant for three weeks.

98
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:18,042
What's really weird is the other
tenants never really saw him.

99
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:22,171
Statements vary.
He was between 5'8" and 6'2".

100
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:26,342
Between 165 and 180 pounds.

101
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:30,346
-Age?
-Between 28 and 45.

102
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:44,068
Before an election, panic is what
you've got on a good day.

103
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,196
-They're waiting for you.
-Hey, Frank.

104
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,450
-Sam.
-lt's been a long time.

105
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,540
-l hear the new director isn't much fun.
-l've been the director for two years.

106
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,961
AI D'Andrea.
You know Matt WiIder.

107
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,007
He still owes me $20
from Super BowI 21 .

108
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:11,012
This is agent-in-charge BiIl Watts
and Lilly Raines.

109
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:17,060
-She's very pretty for a secretary.
-And you're very old for an agent.

110
00:16:17,268 --> 00:16:19,562
Lilly's an agent.

111
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:24,192
l just wanted to see
if she had a sense of humor.

112
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,237
Have a seat.
Let's talk about this guy.

113
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,742
l guess we're caIling him
Booth for now.

114
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,622
-What do you know about him?
-He's dangerous.

115
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:42,502
-How do you know?
-l know things about people.

116
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:46,923
Why didn't you take steps
to know more that first night?

117
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:51,302
-We had a busy day.
-Too busy to investigate properly?

118
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:56,766
-A 10-minute search of his room?
-l didn't have a warrant.

119
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:01,479
-Given your reputation--
-What reputation is that?

120
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:05,692
-Let's get back on track.
-What are you referring to?

121
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:09,112
Am l paranoid,
or is he busting my balls?

122
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:12,198
Probably a Iittle of both.

123
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,621
BilI, there was a time around here
when l was almost as arrogant as you.

124
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:25,294
l don't have time for this. l've got
to pull 75 agents out of Miami.

125
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,257
Keep me posted, Sam, wilI you?

126
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:37,932
-So what do we do with this guy?
-We keep investigating.

127
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:41,602
-Tap my phone.
-Will he call again?

128
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:46,441
-He'll calI. He's got panache.
-Panache?

129
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,820
-Yes, it means flamboyance.
-l know what it means.

130
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,783
-ReaIly? l had to look it up.
-AlI right, we'lI tap your phone.

131
00:17:56,534 --> 00:18:01,789
By the way, Watts isn't nearly
as arrogant as you were.

132
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:12,049
Just what reputation was Watts
referring to, Sam?

133
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:14,969
You know.

134
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,597
ls it because l'm considered
a borderline burn-out...

135
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:22,185
...with questionabIe social skills?

136
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:27,857
What do you want to talk to me
about, besides your reputation?

137
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:31,611
l want to be assigned
to the President.

138
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:37,158
Protection? After all these years?
Frank, you're a dinosaur.

139
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:42,872
-This guy's gonna make a try.
-Watts will fight me all the way.

140
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,167
You owe it to me.

141
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:50,713
-l've kept you in a job.
-l've got to come back.

142
00:18:55,635 --> 00:19:01,516
Do you realIy want
to stand post again? At your age?

143
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:07,855
Yeah, l've got at least
one pair of good shoes somewhere.

144
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,625
We're stopping.
Traveler wants to work the ropes.

145
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,962
The French President's coming.
Get a security man up here.

146
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:40,323
Damn it! Get back.

147
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,309
-What's going on here?
-Horrigan had a heart attack.

148
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,026
-Hey, are you okay?
-Get the helI out of here.

149
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:21,447
-What's going on?
-l had a call about a cardiac case.

150
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:26,118
-Are you all right, Frank?
-l'm on my break here.

151
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,538
l get it, you bastards.

152
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:33,501
Who's the wise guy?

153
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,380
Okay, everybody, back to work.

154
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,389
-AlI right, who was the joker?
-lt may not have been a joke.

155
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:52,770
-You were looking peaked today.
-l'll pay him back in spades.

156
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:56,565
How can you be sure it was a him?

157
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:07,994
-You've missed my street, AI.
-Why don't you have a car?

158
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:12,289
l lived in New York a Iong time.
l like public transportation.

159
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:16,585
lf you like buses,
why make me go out of my way?

160
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:20,423
l like your company.

161
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:27,680
-He's a weird-Iooking guy.
-lf he still looks like that.

162
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,103
Pull up over here.

163
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:10,890
The President's election troubles
were hardly apparent today.

164
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:16,437
He and the French President
stopped twice to greet the crowds.

165
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:22,318
The Senate has yet to react
to the new French trade agreement.

166
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:28,949
The French will host a formal dinner
at their embassy for the President.

167
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:32,286
Presidential advisors are pleased...

168
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,999
...with the publicity this
has brought in an election year.

169
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,005
lt's a weird sub-culture, Al.
Send some agents to check this out.

170
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:49,470
-Ask about some wackos.
-l'll get on it in the morning.

171
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,890
Hang on, l've got the other line.

172
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:58,020
-Yeah?
-Frank.

173
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:07,279
-Booth, how are you doing?
-l'm fine, thanks.

174
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,534
Hang on,
l'll get rid of the other calI.

175
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:15,913
-You got it?
-Yeah, keep him talking.

176
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:22,711
-Yeah?
-Trying to trace me?

177
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:28,968
-Why didn't l think of that?
-You did. You're a good adversary.

178
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:34,557
-But l was worried about you today.
-Why?

179
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:39,520
ln the motorcade, l thought
you were going to pass out.

180
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:43,566
You should get in shape
for that kind of duty.

181
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:50,072
-Yeah, maybe you're right.
-l'm watching your movie.

182
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:56,245
-Movie?
-November '63. Kennedy's last days.

183
00:24:56,495 --> 00:24:59,331
The arrival in Texas.

184
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,752
lt must have been exciting.

185
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:09,008
Dallas. That morning at Love Field.

186
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:14,930
You all look so radiant.
JFK, Jackie and you.

187
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:18,601
You look so young and able, Frank.

188
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,770
What did happen to you that day?

189
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:27,902
The only agent to react to the shots
was farther away than you.

190
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:34,116
You must have looked up at that
window, but you didn't react.

191
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:38,621
Late at night when the demons come...

192
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:44,376
...do you see the rifle at the window,
or Kennedy's head being blown apart?

193
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:52,259
lf you'd reacted in time,
could you have saved him?

194
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:58,807
lf you had, that could've been
your head being blown apart.

195
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:04,647
Do you wish you'd succeeded,
or is life too precious?

196
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,441
What's done is done.

197
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:12,363
l have that Esquire article
on the tenth anniversary...

198
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:15,115
...about you and the other agents.

199
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:21,121
So sad how your wife left you
and took your littIe daughter.

200
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:26,126
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem.

201
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:29,338
And that you weren't easy to live with.

202
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:33,342
l was so moved by your honesty.

203
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:38,847
The world can be a cruel place
to an honest man.

204
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,810
What about you, Booth?
What's your story?

205
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,647
lt's an epic saga.

206
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,152
l'll talk to you again soon.
lt's nice to have a friend.

207
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,454
-Did you get him?
-We got him.

208
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:30,691
He could have a device that makes it
look like he's using another number.

209
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:36,322
-This device, how could he get it?
-He could build one.

210
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:41,035
-Can you trace it?
-We couId run a parity check.

211
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:46,248
-Can you trace the call?
-Not if it's a para-analog line.

212
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:51,253
Give me a straight answer,
or AI will shoot off his foot.

213
00:27:51,462 --> 00:27:57,843
lf he calls again, keep him on
the line. We'll see what we can do.

214
00:27:58,052 --> 00:28:03,599
You might suggest that the police
don't knock down any more doors.

215
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:12,274
l have that Esquire article
about you and the other agents.

216
00:28:13,275 --> 00:28:18,447
So sad how your wife left you
and took your little daughter.

217
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:23,160
You were so forthright
about your drinking problem.

218
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:26,455
And that you weren't easy to live with.

219
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:30,667
l was so moved by your honesty.

220
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:37,299
-Okay, but why play it for me?
-Cancel the President's dinner.

221
00:28:38,926 --> 00:28:45,140
The dinner at the French Embassy?
This close to the election?

222
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:48,185
He manipulated the phone system.

223
00:28:48,352 --> 00:28:50,562
He could have
knowIedge of explosives.

224
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:55,359
-Do your job. There'll be no probIems.
-There may be arms in the embassy.

225
00:28:55,901 --> 00:29:00,906
You think the French
want to knock off the President?

226
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,950
Why does every chief of staff--

227
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,830
You have no reason to think that
this is anything but an idle threat.

228
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,419
You want me to cancel a state dinner
and risk offending the French?

229
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:19,800
This guy's pushed your buttons
and you're overreacting a little.

230
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,762
-l'm trying to protect your boss.
-So am l.

231
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:29,059
We're trailing 12 points in the polIs,
and the election's in six weeks.

232
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,480
-He's got to be seen.
-Even if it kills him?

233
00:29:36,692 --> 00:29:40,195
How could being down 12 points
look like good news?

234
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:43,157
The President was even worse off
weeks ago.

235
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:49,705
He'll be out with the voters in
the Midwest and then in California.

236
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:57,045
The President and First Lady
of the United States.

237
00:29:57,254 --> 00:30:01,550
His Excellency, the
President of France and his wife.

238
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,094
Agent Raines,
you look devastating tonight.

239
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:49,306
-Thank you.
-Good enough to eat, l might add...

240
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,809
...if you'll pardon the expression.

241
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:57,898
l try to sympathize with you,
but you realIy do annoy me.

242
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:01,193
Why sympathize?

243
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:05,197
The tape of that phone call.
When he mentioned your wife.

244
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,076
-Ex-wife.
-At any rate, l'm sorry.

245
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:15,582
Strange, l get sympathy from
an assassin and a woman l annoy.

246
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,920
-WouId you care to dance?
-Perhaps some other time.

247
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,422
l get off in a couple of hours.

248
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:29,763
-What are you looking at?
-Where do you hide your firearm?

249
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,767
Don't telI me, Iet me guess.

250
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:48,407
We're on our final approach to L.A.
lt's a beautiful day out there.

251
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,744
Thanks for flying with us.
We hope to see you again.

252
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:17,644
-Deposit this in the new account.
-l'll need to see your papers.

253
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,862
"Microspan Corporation."
What kind of business are you in?

254
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,033
-Software.
-Up in San Jose?

255
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:35,162
l'm based there,
but l'm opening an office in L.A.

256
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:40,500
You're not from San Jose?
Where are you from?

257
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:45,172
-Minneapolis.
-You're kidding! So am l.

258
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,093
WelI, it's a smaIl world.

259
00:32:52,346 --> 00:32:55,724
l hated the winters.
l used to stay in and pig out.

260
00:32:55,932 --> 00:33:02,606
-What high school did you go to?
-New Brighton High School.

261
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:11,239
-There isn't any New Brighton.
-There was when l was there.

262
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,577
WelI, maybe l'm just confused.
lt happens a Iot.

263
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:22,542
-There was a schooI across from--
-l'm Iate, will this take long?

264
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,921
Not at aIl, just another minute.

265
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,300
Thank you.

266
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:40,936
-You have a very pleasant manner.
-Thank you, Mr. Carney.

267
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,661
How wouId you like
to give a colleague a ride home?

268
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:02,165
-Why do you keep fIirting with me?
-Am l?

269
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:07,838
-You know it can't go anywhere.
-That's why l do it.

270
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:12,342
Come on, l'lI buy you an ice cream.
No further obligations.

271
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,053
Oh, boy.

272
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:22,519
-How many female agents are there?
-About 125.

273
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:28,316
-Pure window dressing.
-Excuse me?

274
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:34,072
Window dressing.
125 out of 2,000.

275
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:39,453
You're around so the President
looks good to his feminist voters.

276
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:44,750
-Do make an effort to be obnoxious?
-lt's a gift.

277
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:50,172
We do a Iot of window dressing.
Like running with the limousine.

278
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,593
lt'd take an anti-tank missiIe
to put a dent in it.

279
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:59,222
But it makes the President
look more presidentiaI.

280
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:04,978
lf l'm here for the feminist vote,
what demographics do you represent?

281
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,439
Let's see.

282
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:10,901
White, piano-pIaying,
heterosexuals over the age of 50.

283
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:16,239
There ain't a lot of us,
but we do have a powerful Iobby.

284
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,830
-Time fIies when you're annoyed.
-Where are you going?

285
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:26,291
-l have a date.
-With whom?

286
00:35:27,042 --> 00:35:29,586
That's none of your business.

287
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:34,174
-You want a ride?
-l don't think so.

288
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:38,637
l like it here this time of day.
l think l'll hang out.

289
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:42,265
Okay, thanks for the ice cream.

290
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,852
-See you.
-You're welcome.

291
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,574
lf she looks back,
that means she's interested.

292
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:07,415
Come on now, give me that
smug look and be on your way.

293
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:22,222
WelI, Abe.... Damn, l wish
l couId've been there for you.

294
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:34,901
Hi, baby, how are you doing?

295
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,947
Yes, l missed you too.

296
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:48,832
l didn't mean to startle you. l got
your address from the phone book.

297
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:55,881
-l'm not Iisted.
-Well, l better come clean.

298
00:36:56,089 --> 00:37:00,677
l followed you. l'm sorry,
l'm not very good at this.

299
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:07,350
l'm new in town. l was wondering
if you'd care to join me for dinner.

300
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:11,563
That's sweet, but....

301
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:16,860
l also wanted to apologize for lying
to you about being from Minneapolis.

302
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,697
l shouldn't ask so many questions.

303
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:26,161
Did you mention our conversation
to anyone at the bank?

304
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,581
-No!
-May l?

305
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:35,629
Rory, settIe down!

306
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:40,508
-Pam, what's going on? Oh, hi.
-This is my roommate.

307
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:46,640
-Sally, this is Mr. Carney.
-Nice to meet you.

308
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:52,354
-l was just on my way out.
-l'm sorry, but you can't leave.

309
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:54,648
What?

310
00:37:54,856 --> 00:37:58,151
You shouldn't have been
from Minneapolis.

311
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,988
l don't know what you want, but....

312
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:26,429
-Hi, this is Sally.
-This is Pam. We're not in right now.

313
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:32,352
-Leave your name and number.
-And we'll call you back. Bye.

314
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:45,323
Frank, l hope you don't mind me
calling you at the office.

315
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:49,452
-No, why don't you drop by?
-l'd love to.

316
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:54,249
Let me take some time to welcome
those who are joining us late.

317
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:58,420
l'd love to drop by.
We've got so much in common.

318
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:01,965
We do? Like what?

319
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,093
We're both willing to trade
our lives for the President's.

320
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:09,806
We were both betrayed
by those we trusted.

321
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:13,893
-l wasn't betrayed, Booth.
-Sure you were, Frank.

322
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:19,149
The Warren Commission reported your
procedure as seriously deficient.

323
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:24,195
They criticized all the agents for
being out drinking the night before.

324
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:30,118
As if Kennedy would be alive today
if you'd been in bed by 10 p.m.

325
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:37,375
-Maybe they were right.
-No, they weren't right.

326
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:42,839
You wanted to have agents stationed
all around his car. He refused.

327
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:48,303
Do you know why?
Because he had a death wish.

328
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:51,014
He talked all the time
about being assassinated.

329
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:53,850
His favorite poem was
"l Have a Rendezvous with Death"...

330
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:57,479
...which is not a good poem, Frank.

331
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:58,980
l think he wanted to die.

332
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:06,863
And l think he didn't care that
his death would ruin your life.

333
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,991
What do you think?

334
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,037
Frank?

335
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:20,168
-What about you? Who betrayed you?
-l don't think he's scrambling it.

336
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:26,091
Some of the same people,
but l'm going to get even.

337
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:32,180
l'll have my day in the sun.
The question is, will you?

338
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:35,975
l think you're in
for a lot more pain.

339
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:40,396
How much of this shit
do l have to Iisten to?

340
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,942
He's across the street.
LaFayette Park.

341
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:46,361
Booth!

342
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:26,985
l told you to get in shape, Frank.

343
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,873
ls this your current address?

344
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,918
And you didn't see anybody suspicious
hanging around that phone booth?

345
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:57,182
That's him! Al, that's him!

346
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:35,887
Secret Service! l'm impounding
this car. He put his hand on here.

347
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:42,268
-We got fingerprints.
-Are you all right, Frank?

348
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,655
Hey Tony, have a look at this.

349
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:41,119
-The print from Secret Service?
-Yeah, it's really strange.

350
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,455
This is C-12. We can't tell them.

351
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:53,548
Horrigan, l'm afraid
we've drawn a blank.

352
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:58,845
-You're sure?
-We ran it against everything.

353
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:10,148
l'm meeting with the President.
You keep investigating.

354
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:15,111
-What should l do?
-You'll think of something.

355
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,573
You're a real pain
when things don't go your way.

356
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,075
Your friends warned you about that.

357
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:44,474
The President hit the campaign trail
today on a 6-day tour of 12 states.

358
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:50,355
With just a month to the election,
he's trailing by 10 points.

359
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:55,860
He'll concentrate on the Midwest,
where he's sagging in the polls.

360
00:44:56,110 --> 00:45:01,783
The campaign will wind up
in Chicago with a big rally.

361
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:05,036
Reservations.

362
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:11,751
Do you have a flight on Tuesday
from Washington to L.A.?

363
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:18,800
l'd like an open-ended ticket so l
can make some stops on my return.

364
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:23,554
C-5, off-load the choppers first.
Who's our route agent?

365
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,266
That'll be Jacqueline King.

366
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:32,230
This is Watts,
we have arrival at 13:15.

367
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:38,486
-Where are we keeping the cars?
-Denver PD has an area for us.

368
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,823
This is Watts,
we're ten minutes out.

369
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:46,327
Here in Denver we gather today
in the shadow of giants.

370
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:53,251
Brave pioneers who overcame the
wilderness and carved a new nation.

371
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:58,756
Today we are asked
to match our vision to their vision.

372
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,593
And to pass that legacy on.

373
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:07,223
-ls sector three secure?
-Sector three is secure.

374
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:12,895
The President was campaigning
today in Denver.

375
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,287
We are living in a time
of global economic transition.

376
00:46:29,704 --> 00:46:34,459
We need compassion and vision
to create a future...

377
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:39,589
...of peace and progress
for everyone.

378
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:45,052
The President is due to arrive
here in L.A. later in the month.

379
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:48,890
He'll compete for California's
54 electoral votes.

380
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:10,661
This is Sandy Riggs calling.

381
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,958
lf you want to catch a rally
in the Midwest, you'd best call me.

382
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,670
The President has no fixed schedule.

383
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:26,761
ln answer to your other question, just
send a check to party headquarters.

384
00:47:27,929 --> 00:47:29,931
Ladies and gentlemen
of Holly, Michigan...

385
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:33,434
...the President of the United States.

386
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:40,775
We've gone a long way
toward achieving that goal....

387
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:45,780
We've got some trouble up ahead.
Notify the White House staff.

388
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,659
Milwaukee will be easy tomorrow.

389
00:47:55,414 --> 00:48:01,796
Flight 318 to Milwaukee
is now boarding at Gate 21 .

390
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:06,884
All passengers
proceed to the boarding area now.

391
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:14,934
Checking.

392
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:19,105
Hey, pal, found any bombs today?

393
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:31,409
-Did the First Lady ask about me?
-Have you gotten to know them yet?

394
00:48:31,617 --> 00:48:35,913
-l prefer not to get to know them.
-Why is that?

395
00:48:36,122 --> 00:48:39,417
They might not be worth
taking a bullet for.

396
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:42,878
Here comes my repIacement.
Let's go to the bar.

397
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:47,508
-We can't drink on the road.
-But they have a great piano player.

398
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:59,395
l've pIayed for presidents
and with presidents.

399
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:03,858
Nixon and l once did
a duet of "Moonglow."

400
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:08,571
-l heard he didn't like you.
-We got on aIl right.

401
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:12,116
His Chief of Staff didn't like me.

402
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:16,704
He once ordered me to get rid of
some anti-war protesters.

403
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:21,542
l said l couldn't do that.
Freedom of speech and such.

404
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:26,589
He said, "When l'm taIking to you,
l am the President."

405
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:31,594
l said, "You look like a sack of shit
in a cheap suit to me, sir!"

406
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:35,765
-The "sir" was a cIassy touch.
-l thought so.

407
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:52,740
You never wear shades
when you're standing post.

408
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:56,577
l like the wackos
to see the whites of my eyes.

409
00:49:56,744 --> 00:50:02,291
A glare can be just as effective
as a gun. Know what l mean?

410
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,003
You know what l mean?

411
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:17,264
You got me.

412
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:20,768
You'd better stick to the shades,
sweetheart.

413
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,706
What are you afraid of?

414
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:46,419
l'm afraid of making a big mistake.

415
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,797
Good night.

416
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:50,858
Good, we've got some updates
on Milwaukee.

417
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:53,360
Thanks.

418
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,956
-Don't answer it.
-No. Oh, shit.

419
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:53,838
Raines.

420
00:53:02,304 --> 00:53:06,433
Okay, l'll be right down.

421
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,984
Traveler's losing ground in
Georgia. Milwaukee's out tomorrow.

422
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:20,447
And they're staging a raIly
somewhere outside Atlanta.

423
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,452
Damn!

424
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:32,793
What am l doing?

425
00:53:39,008 --> 00:53:41,677
Oh, LilIy....

426
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:48,017
l've got to put all that shit
back on, damn it!

427
00:53:55,983 --> 00:54:00,654
l'm glad to see you all
out here in the rain with me today.

428
00:54:00,863 --> 00:54:06,368
l've been saying,
"Don't just vote for me, join me."

429
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:12,166
And today you certainly have.
We may get a tad damp today.

430
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:16,879
But guess who's gonna be all wet
on Election Day?

431
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,599
How about the watch list?

432
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:32,186
Twenty-three crazies
are under surveillance.

433
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:33,854
The hospital?

434
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:37,358
Extra units of Traveler's
blood type are on hand.

435
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:40,527
Accessible to the alternate route too.

436
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,750
-Under the weather?
-Sick as a dog, Lilly.

437
00:54:55,668 --> 00:54:59,880
What's this? "PsychoIogicaI
Profile of John Booth."

438
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,592
-Did you make a mistake?
-What?

439
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,555
You said you were afraid
of making a big mistake.

440
00:55:10,891 --> 00:55:16,897
With this job, let's be realistic.
lt's not like we work in a bank.

441
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:23,570
-You had an affair with an agent?
-He wasn't an agent.

442
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,826
But he left you
because you wouldn't quit your job?

443
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:33,288
l left him.
l wouldn't quit my job for him.

444
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,417
lt broke my heart.

445
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:43,215
You vowed never again to let a man
come between you and your career.

446
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:48,804
But now you're in love with me and
it scares you a little, doesn't it?

447
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:52,766
-Blow your nose.
-Sorry.

448
00:55:56,603 --> 00:56:02,860
What would happen
if l gave up my job for you?

449
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:09,450
Why wouId you do that?

450
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:14,788
l vowed never again to let my career
come between me and a woman.

451
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,756
Frank....

452
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:28,260
-Hey, be careful, will you?
-Yeah?

453
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:32,139
This whole event's been advertised
in advance. Just be alert.

454
00:56:45,986 --> 00:56:51,658
Watts, it's Horrigan, it's a zoo here.
We gotta take Traveler underground.

455
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:57,164
This is Watts. We are using the
alternate arrival site. Underground.

456
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:16,725
-Watts, Booth may be here.
-l thought you couldn't identify him.

457
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:22,564
-l can't. Just calI it a hunch.
-lgnore your psychic abilities.

458
00:57:22,815 --> 00:57:25,734
All posts take to your positions.

459
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:30,864
-You've got a fever, Frank.
-You stay aIert in there, wilI you?

460
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:40,707
One quality above aIl
marks this President.

461
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:46,130
lt has earned him the respect
of the people of this country.

462
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,967
That quality is courage.

463
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:58,142
The question is, will we stand
by the man who has stood by us?

464
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:02,396
-Stage right?
-Stage right, aIl clear.

465
00:58:03,063 --> 00:58:06,733
-Stage left?
-Stage left, cIear.

466
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:11,280
-Stage center?
-Stage center, clear.

467
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:18,745
The President of the United States
and the First Lady!

468
00:58:57,159 --> 00:59:00,412
-Gun!
-Get down!

469
00:59:14,468 --> 00:59:17,304
What the hell's going on in there?

470
00:59:20,182 --> 00:59:22,809
AIl clear.

471
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:27,814
-False alarm.
-Traveler's secure. Resume positions.

472
00:59:28,148 --> 00:59:31,818
-Are you hurt, Mr. President?
-l'm all right.

473
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:40,452
Everything's all right, folks.
We had a little false alarm there.

474
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:45,916
That was exciting, wasn't it?
Take your seat, please.

475
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:52,547
lt was just a balIoon popping.
Traveler wants to continue.

476
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:19,032
Do you have any idea how many
votes you cost us Iast night?

477
01:00:19,283 --> 01:00:21,868
The President looked like a coward.

478
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,790
He looked all right. You were
the one who looked like a coward.

479
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,836
-ls this just a joke to you?
-No, you're a joke to me.

480
01:00:31,086 --> 01:00:33,839
-You have no idea what we do.
-That's enough!

481
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:37,592
l'll have you busting
counterfeiters in Alaska!

482
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:42,180
Keep him away from the White House
and away from me!

483
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:45,434
-The man's a disgrace.
-You can't taIk to him like that.

484
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,893
l don't work for him.

485
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:52,899
You work for me. At Ieast
you did. You're off my detail.

486
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:06,621
My Super Bowl debt. ln case
l don't see you after this trip.

487
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,090
You know, Frank...

488
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:22,137
...if you just acknowledge that
it was an unfortunate situation--

489
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:26,641
-l'm not going to apoIogize.
-l'm not saying you should.

490
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,812
-But the President was humiIiated.
-He's alive.

491
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:34,900
-We are here to save his dignity too.
-l'm not paid for that.

492
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:41,406
When Kennedy's girlfriend got into
troubIe, you said she was with you.

493
01:01:43,658 --> 01:01:48,914
-That was just a rumor.
-l heard the whoIe story.

494
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:54,127
You were suspended for a month
in order to save his dignity.

495
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:58,715
-He was different.
-Maybe you were different.

496
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:02,803
l was different.
The whole country was different.

497
01:02:03,053 --> 01:02:08,558
Everything wouId be different if l'd
been half as paranoid as l am today.

498
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,150
Frank....

499
01:02:29,454 --> 01:02:36,044
Why not just retire? Live off
your pension. What's the point?

500
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:42,342
Somebody else asked me that
not long ago.

501
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:46,388
You don't spend any money,
except on jazz records.

502
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:50,725
l want to stay
on the Booth case, Sam.

503
01:02:52,519 --> 01:02:56,189
AIl right, but as for
protective detail--

504
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:58,900
l understand.

505
01:03:03,864 --> 01:03:07,617
That thing in Chicago....

506
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:12,330
l've never been on the wrong side
of a judgment caIl like that.

507
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:17,627
You had the fIu!
That can impair your judgment.

508
01:03:17,836 --> 01:03:23,467
Face it, Frank.
You're too old for this shit.

509
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:20,023
Hello.

510
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:23,777
What happened
in the Windy City, Frank?

511
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:26,780
Booth?

512
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:32,953
-Did the baIloon get you panicky?
-You were there.

513
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:34,579
Yes, yes.

514
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:43,547
l couIdn't help wondering why you'd
risk your life to save such a man.

515
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:48,885
You have such a strange job. l can't
decide if it's heroic or absurd.

516
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:54,224
Why wouId you risk your life
to kill a man like that?

517
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:59,229
-Read my psychological profile.
-l don't believe in them.

518
01:04:59,437 --> 01:05:04,317
Nor do l. A man's actions don't equal
the sum of his psychoIogicaI parts.

519
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,320
-lt doesn't work that way.
-Just how does it work?

520
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:18,331
lt doesn't work. God doesn't punish
the wicked and reward the righteous.

521
01:05:18,498 --> 01:05:22,836
Everyone dies.
Some die because they deserve to.

522
01:05:23,003 --> 01:05:28,883
Others die because they come
from Minneapolis. It's meaningless.

523
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:33,638
lf none of this means anything,
why kiIl the President?

524
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:40,854
-To punctuate the dreariness.
-You need to get yourself Iaid.

525
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:46,943
You're the same. Name one thing
in your life that has any meaning.

526
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:51,448
-l play the piano.
-That's not enough.

527
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,241
How do you know? Do you pIay?

528
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:58,038
l've seen you in your bar aIone.

529
01:05:58,246 --> 01:06:04,794
There's no cause worth fighting for.
AIl we have is the game.

530
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:09,716
-l'm on offense. You're on defense.
-When do we start playing the game?

531
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:14,429
The cIock's ticking, Frank.
Take care.

532
01:06:14,596 --> 01:06:17,724
Wait. Wait, Booth.

533
01:06:20,894 --> 01:06:24,773
He scrambled it. l missed him.

534
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,776
Fuck!

535
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:33,198
Fucker.

536
01:06:57,055 --> 01:06:59,683
Jesus, Frank.

537
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:05,855
l called for hours.
l thought something happened to you.

538
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:13,488
l'm sick, l'm tired
and l'm armed, too. So be carefuI.

539
01:07:13,697 --> 01:07:19,160
-You're also maybe a genius.
-Not to be recognized in this lifetime.

540
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:22,706
-Did you listen to the calI?
-Yeah, remember--?

541
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,958
Call the field office in MinneapoIis.

542
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:27,293
See what you can find
about accidental deaths.

543
01:07:27,502 --> 01:07:31,047
Frank!
Will you listen to me, please?

544
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:35,760
-Spit it out, damn it!
-We spoke to some model builders.

545
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:43,309
There is a professor at Pasadena
College. l think we've got something.

546
01:07:43,518 --> 01:07:48,481
l met him at a design conference
in New Orleans a year ago.

547
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:54,320
We ordered a few rounds of drinks.
He seemed like a nice enough guy.

548
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:58,491
But when we talked politics
he got a nasty edge.

549
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:05,165
He said the government betrayed him
and he was out for revenge.

550
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,334
The way he said it scared me.

551
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:13,506
l said, "Nice taIking to you."
And l got the hell out of there.

552
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:18,595
For the life of me
l cannot remember his name.

553
01:08:18,803 --> 01:08:23,057
But l'm pretty sure
he said he was from Phoenix.

554
01:08:23,266 --> 01:08:29,272
You ought to talk to a guy
in Phoenix named Walter WickIand.

555
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:34,694
-We're going to Phoenix.
-Let's get a police artist.

556
01:08:34,903 --> 01:08:40,533
-Have a sketch faxed to us.
-You figured that out by yourself?

557
01:08:40,742 --> 01:08:45,622
-Kiss my ass, Frank.
-l told you you'd make a good agent.

558
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:53,129
That doesn't look much like him,
but it's got to be Mitch Leary.

559
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:59,302
-l haven't seen him in over a year.
-What do you know about the guy?

560
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:03,723
You see this wheelchair?
Mitch bought it for me.

561
01:09:03,932 --> 01:09:07,685
lt cost over $1 ,000.

562
01:09:07,894 --> 01:09:11,898
-You see this?
-Take it easy now.

563
01:09:12,106 --> 01:09:15,443
This is in case he ever comes back.

564
01:09:15,652 --> 01:09:18,988
He accused me
of ripping off his design.

565
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:22,659
He said my penalty for disIoyalty
was death.

566
01:09:22,951 --> 01:09:26,579
lf you put him away,
l'll sleep better.

567
01:09:26,830 --> 01:09:32,126
-Where can we find him?
-l've got his address somewhere.

568
01:10:43,323 --> 01:10:45,867
Don't move.

569
01:10:55,543 --> 01:10:57,629
Drop it!

570
01:11:10,183 --> 01:11:13,186
-Let him go, Horrigan.
-l got him.

571
01:11:13,353 --> 01:11:18,149
lt's okay. We're on the same team.

572
01:11:18,358 --> 01:11:24,238
-Hands, motherfucker!
-l'm getting my identification!

573
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:28,701
-Give it to me.
-David Coppinger. ClA.

574
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:34,540
-And who's this asshole?
-He's with me.

575
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:39,796
-Goddamn it!
-Are you here for Leary or me?

576
01:11:40,046 --> 01:11:44,592
Mr. Leary used to be
one of our operatives.

577
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:51,099
-He's threatened to kill the President.
-We didn't think he was serious.

578
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:54,227
-But you knew. You and the FBl.
-l understand your frustration.

579
01:11:54,394 --> 01:11:58,606
You understand my frustration?
You pompous son of a bitch!

580
01:11:58,898 --> 01:12:03,987
What did Leary do for you?
Run drugs? Sell arms to lran?

581
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:08,700
lt's a C-12 matter,
so this is off the record.

582
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,827
lf asked, l'm going to deny it.

583
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:19,836
-Leary's what we call a wet boy.
-What's a wet boy, Frank?

584
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:28,261
-Leary's an assassin.
-He's more like a predator.

585
01:12:46,446 --> 01:12:49,449
-Was that you shooting?
-Yes.

586
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:54,746
-What kind of gun is that?
-Something l made.

587
01:12:55,663 --> 01:13:00,251
You made it?
That beats paying for it.

588
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:03,379
-Can l see it?
-Yeah.

589
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:09,052
-lt's light. What's it made of?
-lt's composite. Like plastic.

590
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:14,265
Pretty neat!
Mind if l give her a little dance?

591
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:18,186
-Not at all.
-Go for it.

592
01:13:26,486 --> 01:13:29,697
That is great! That is really great!

593
01:13:33,993 --> 01:13:39,582
-WouId you sell it?
-No, l need it.

594
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:45,421
-For what?
-To assassinate the President.

595
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:57,850
-Why would you want to do that for?
-Why did you kill that bird, asshole?

596
01:14:05,233 --> 01:14:10,571
Leary was one of our most effective
contractors, but times changed.

597
01:14:10,822 --> 01:14:15,368
Cutbacks had to be made.
Leary didn't take it too well.

598
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:21,457
-We've not been able to Iocate him.
-We can work together on this.

599
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:26,879
-WouIdn't that be refreshing?
-We have fingerprints and photos.

600
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:33,427
-These are at least 15 years old.
-He's camera-shy.

601
01:14:33,761 --> 01:14:39,851
He'll be in disguise, anyway.
We need photo alterations, Sam.

602
01:14:40,059 --> 01:14:45,481
What l'm about to show you
is highIy classified.

603
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:51,404
This is a former colleague
of Leary's. A close friend.

604
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:56,993
He went by Leary's home to try
and get him to accept counseling.

605
01:14:57,243 --> 01:15:01,455
This is how Leary
treats his friends.

606
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:12,925
We need every possible variable.
Facial hair, glasses, weight change.

607
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,804
Keep in mind
he's 15 years older now.

608
01:15:38,910 --> 01:15:43,497
As good as they are, they aren't
much good. The eyes are dead.

609
01:15:43,706 --> 01:15:47,793
You can aIways tell a man
by his eyes.

610
01:15:48,711 --> 01:15:52,465
-Tomorrow morning l'd Iike you to--
-l'm resigning tomorrow.

611
01:15:52,632 --> 01:15:55,468
What?

612
01:15:55,635 --> 01:16:01,182
What for? Because you were scared
down in Phoenix? l was scared too.

613
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:08,981
l have nightmares about that
boat with the bag over my head.

614
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:13,236
l can't breathe.
Phoenix clinched it.

615
01:16:13,486 --> 01:16:19,367
-The service has counselors.
-l've been to counselors.

616
01:16:19,825 --> 01:16:24,497
-We can get this guy.
-l can't do it!

617
01:16:24,664 --> 01:16:31,504
Stop this cockamamie shit.
Come on, pal, l need you.

618
01:16:31,671 --> 01:16:34,465
PIease.

619
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:42,890
Okay, Frank.

620
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:54,527
Cockamamie. That's a word
your generation hasn't embraced yet.

621
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:59,198
You ought to use it once in a while
to keep it aIive.

622
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:02,535
-Cockamamie!
-Yeah.

623
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:05,997
-Oh, God!
-Well, it made you Iaugh.

624
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:08,207
You kill me, Frank.

625
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,131
Hello.

626
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:22,888
Hello, Frank. And let me welcome
all of you joining our program.

627
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:26,100
l know who you are, Leary.

628
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:36,235
l'm glad. Friends should be able
to caIl each other by name.

629
01:17:36,444 --> 01:17:39,947
-We're not friends.
-Sure, we are.

630
01:17:40,239 --> 01:17:42,158
l've seen what you do to friends.

631
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:49,332
-What's that supposed to mean?
-You slit your friend's throat.

632
01:17:58,257 --> 01:18:03,137
-You talked to Coppinger?
-Yeah.

633
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:07,308
Did you de-Iouse?
The man's a professional liar.

634
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,101
l saw the photos.

635
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:12,271
No, you saw what
he wanted you to see.

636
01:18:12,563 --> 01:18:16,108
l saw a picture of your friend
with his throat cut.

637
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:21,155
What you don't know
is that they sent my best friend...

638
01:18:21,364 --> 01:18:26,077
...to my home to kilI me!

639
01:18:26,952 --> 01:18:30,790
-Your voice is shaking.
-l haven't lied to you, Frank!

640
01:18:30,998 --> 01:18:35,586
Everyone who ever knew you
says you're sick.

641
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:40,966
-Your colleagues. Your wife.
-What does your wife say about you?

642
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:45,137
Frank, l want you to understand.

643
01:18:45,346 --> 01:18:50,976
We both used to think that this
country was a very special place.

644
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:56,816
Do you have any idea
what l've done for God and country?

645
01:18:56,982 --> 01:18:59,652
Some horribIe things!

646
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:04,657
l don't even remember who l was
before they got their claws into me.

647
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:12,498
-They made you into a real monster.
-And now they want to destroy me.

648
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:19,547
What do you see when you're in
the dark and the demons come?

649
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:31,016
l see you standing over the grave
of another dead President.

650
01:19:31,559 --> 01:19:34,520
-That's not gonna happen.
-Fuck you, Frank.

651
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:40,192
l'm wilIing to trade my life
for his and that's aIl it takes.

652
01:19:40,359 --> 01:19:44,530
That President is coming home
from CaIifornia in a box.

653
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:49,535
-Where in California?
-The address?

654
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:53,956
l'll keep you in the game,
but l won't throw it for you.

655
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:59,462
-l want you to give yourself up.
-To live a long and fruitful life?

656
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:06,218
Don't Iie to me.
l have a rendezvous with death.

657
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:10,681
So does the President.
And so do you, if you get too close.

658
01:20:10,890 --> 01:20:13,601
You have a rendezvous
with my ass, motherfucker!

659
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:18,105
You know how easily l could kill you?

660
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:21,901
l've watched you go home.

661
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:25,362
You are alive because
l have allowed you to live.

662
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:29,909
Show me some damn respect!

663
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:42,588
St. Francis Hotel!

664
01:20:58,938 --> 01:21:00,272
Frank.

665
01:23:56,407 --> 01:23:59,660
Take my hand, Frank.

666
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:04,081
Take it. lf you don't, you'lI die.

667
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:10,796
Take it.

668
01:24:25,644 --> 01:24:29,982
You're gonna shoot me
after l saved your life?

669
01:24:33,193 --> 01:24:34,862
Shit.

670
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,658
The onIy way to save the President
is to shoot me.

671
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:43,620
Are you wiIling
to trade your life for his...

672
01:24:43,829 --> 01:24:47,166
...or is life too precious?

673
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:06,143
Leary, don't move!

674
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:11,231
l got him!

675
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:18,530
AI?

676
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,693
There's nothing here.

677
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:50,539
Frank, you've got a phone call.

678
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:01,633
Yeah?

679
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:06,471
Frank, you looked so sad on the bus.
l'm sorry, it was seIf-defense.

680
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:18,692
-TelI me about Skellum.
-Skellum is worthless.

681
01:27:18,942 --> 01:27:24,489
-Are you gonna meet him in L.A.?
-You're way behind in the game.

682
01:27:24,781 --> 01:27:28,952
l'm way ahead. l know what you
look like. l've seen your eyes.

683
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:32,372
-They might look different next time.
-Not what's behind them.

684
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:37,669
-You better pray l never find you.
-You want to kill me, Frank?

685
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:40,797
That's right.

686
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:45,010
-The irony's so thick here.
-There is no irony!

687
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:51,141
The same government that trained
me to kill, trained you to protect.

688
01:27:51,350 --> 01:27:55,145
Now you want to kilI me.
Up on that roof l protected you.

689
01:27:55,354 --> 01:27:57,189
They'll write books about us.

690
01:27:57,356 --> 01:28:03,403
-l'm tired of your bulIshit!
-Don't be a poor sport.

691
01:28:03,654 --> 01:28:10,744
You could have taken me out,
but you chose to save your ass.

692
01:28:12,162 --> 01:28:15,207
lt does make me wonder about Dallas.

693
01:28:15,415 --> 01:28:20,253
Did you really do all you could,
or did you make a choice there too?

694
01:28:23,840 --> 01:28:27,928
Do you realIy have the guts
to take a bullet?

695
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:32,349
l'll be thinking about that
when l'm pissing on your grave.

696
01:28:36,895 --> 01:28:40,899
There's no one named Skellum
in all of Los AngeIes?

697
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:45,278
-What about Louisiana?
-Hang on.

698
01:28:48,240 --> 01:28:52,035
No Skellums. Sorry.

699
01:28:52,244 --> 01:28:54,955
Damn it!

700
01:29:03,171 --> 01:29:07,801
-The election's in three weeks.
-Just stay out of California.

701
01:29:08,051 --> 01:29:11,930
lf this guy's so smart, he's not gonna
tell you where he'll do it.

702
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:14,599
l don't think he'd Iie to me.

703
01:29:14,766 --> 01:29:18,228
You've become that close?

704
01:29:18,437 --> 01:29:22,774
California is the key
to the whole race.

705
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:28,905
-We can't let up now.
-We have to change our procedure.

706
01:29:29,114 --> 01:29:36,788
-Frisk people within 50 yards.
-At $10,000 dinners?

707
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:41,209
-You're overreacting.
-lf l don't, the President's dead.

708
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:45,756
-Why is he even here?
-He's heading this investigation.

709
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:50,427
Then let him investigate,
but keep him out of sight.

710
01:29:51,261 --> 01:29:54,973
lf you'll excuse me,
l'm in the middle of a campaign.

711
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:06,651
-Frank. Hi.
-Hi.

712
01:30:07,986 --> 01:30:13,658
-Up Iate?
-L.A. wilI be a Iot of work.

713
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:18,330
-What's up?
-l've got a request.

714
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:24,461
l'd like you to talk to Watts.
Get me on your team.

715
01:30:29,049 --> 01:30:34,012
-He thinks you'Il overreact.
-What do you think?

716
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:39,559
-You're too cIose to all this.
-That's why l've got to be there.

717
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:44,815
-l can spot him. Anticipate him.
-You think he'll be in CaIifornia?

718
01:30:45,023 --> 01:30:51,029
-Why would he tip you off?
-He wants to keep the game close.

719
01:30:54,116 --> 01:30:59,621
This has nothing to do with
you and me. Strictly professional.

720
01:31:00,288 --> 01:31:04,292
But that son of a bitch
kilIed my partner. My friend.

721
01:31:04,876 --> 01:31:08,547
l know. l'm sorry.

722
01:31:13,009 --> 01:31:16,054
You're looking at a Iiving legend.

723
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:20,725
The onIy active agent
who ever lost a President.

724
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:25,897
PIease.

725
01:31:39,786 --> 01:31:42,372
Mr. Horrigan, weIcome to Los Angeles.

726
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:49,379
Can the President close the gap
in the little time he has left?

727
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:55,552
Today he's in California for a rally
at the Bonaventure Hotel.

728
01:32:04,853 --> 01:32:10,233
Field office, the advance team
is at the Bonaventure.

729
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:01,284
-Any problems?
-No.

730
01:33:06,373 --> 01:33:10,001
We've swept the motorcade route.

731
01:33:10,168 --> 01:33:16,091
Manholes are secured. Mailboxes
removed. Abandoned vehicles towed.

732
01:33:22,097 --> 01:33:26,518
We'll need sharpshooters
on both those towers.

733
01:33:26,685 --> 01:33:31,940
We need sharpshooters
to cover those restricted areas.

734
01:33:32,148 --> 01:33:36,194
Other polls today had the President
three points behind.

735
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:40,907
He'll have to close that margin
in California.

736
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:53,503
Welcome to Los Angeles
lnternational Airport.

737
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:57,752
-Raines, double-checking those exits?
-Yes, this is the third time now.

738
01:36:07,303 --> 01:36:10,348
AIert, section five.

739
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:19,649
Secret Service.

740
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:34,456
-Robert Stermer.
-He's a bellboy. He's cleared.

741
01:36:36,541 --> 01:36:42,464
-Robert, have a nice day.
-No questions.

742
01:36:42,672 --> 01:36:47,135
Come on, pack it up and move.

743
01:36:47,844 --> 01:36:51,556
Mr. Carney, all set.

744
01:36:51,723 --> 01:36:55,226
Finally we meet!
You are James Carney?

745
01:36:55,393 --> 01:37:01,983
-You must be Sandy Riggs.
-So you really do exist.

746
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:08,198
-l'm very much human.
-Let's go up to the bar.

747
01:37:09,908 --> 01:37:14,746
-When does the President arrive?
-Tomorrow, before dinner.

748
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:20,877
Here's an invitation. Don't lose it.
The Secret Service is acting crazy.

749
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:25,757
You've got a great seat,
just across from the President.

750
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:31,221
So what is Microspan Corporation
all about?

751
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:36,142
l just came to meet the President.
l won't bore you with business.

752
01:37:36,351 --> 01:37:40,271
l don't blame you.
l don't understand high-tech.

753
01:37:40,438 --> 01:37:44,776
l can't wait to introduce you.
Look at this beautiful view.

754
01:37:46,277 --> 01:37:48,029
Yes, very pretty.

755
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:54,869
Give me the list of dinner guests.
Who was the organizer?

756
01:37:55,078 --> 01:37:59,916
Sanford Riggs
of the California Victory Fund.

757
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:05,463
Call LAPD and make sure
they have no uniforms missing.

758
01:38:05,797 --> 01:38:12,303
-lt's been taken care of.
-Call the hospitaI about blood.

759
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:18,309
Your average American businessman
who looks at product marketing...

760
01:38:18,476 --> 01:38:23,731
...sees the Iength and width of it.
The Japanese see the depth.

761
01:38:23,940 --> 01:38:29,571
We pIan the next fiscal quarter.
They plan the next quarter century.

762
01:38:29,779 --> 01:38:36,995
-Our peopIe don't understand that.
-Mr. Riggs, can l taIk to you?

763
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:41,833
-Who's that?
-Secret Service agent.

764
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:46,087
-Do you know aIl these people?
-l sure do.

765
01:38:46,296 --> 01:38:51,718
-How about these pictures here?
-l went through all this yesterday.

766
01:38:51,926 --> 01:38:55,638
l'll cooperate, but this is
bordering on harassment.

767
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:59,267
l'm a harassing kind of guy.

768
01:39:00,018 --> 01:39:01,936
No, no, no, no.

769
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,690
l'll be right back, Mr. Carney.

770
01:39:06,107 --> 01:39:07,859
He did what anyone of us would.

771
01:39:08,026 --> 01:39:11,779
He beat up a bellboy on television.
l'd say he was overwrought.

772
01:39:12,030 --> 01:39:15,033
We're alI overwrought.
Leary's out there someplace.

773
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:18,369
-You don't think he's a liability?
-No.

774
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:21,497
Well, you're in the minority.
l want him gone.

775
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:25,960
-Send him on to San Diego.
-By whose order?

776
01:39:26,127 --> 01:39:30,548
Traveler.
Do you want to tell him or should l?

777
01:39:30,757 --> 01:39:35,219
Miss Raines, somebody's
approaching Traveler's suite.

778
01:40:11,673 --> 01:40:14,509
-Hi.
-Hi.

779
01:40:15,927 --> 01:40:23,393
-What are you doing up here?
-Seeing what l couId do.

780
01:40:25,103 --> 01:40:30,900
Between the LAPD,
the FBl and the rest of us...

781
01:40:31,109 --> 01:40:36,531
...there are 229 peopIe
protecting Traveler tomorrow.

782
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:40,535
A lot of guns.

783
01:40:41,244 --> 01:40:46,791
lf Leary gets off a shot,
we could be kiIled in the crossfire.

784
01:40:48,459 --> 01:40:51,421
Frank.

785
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:57,927
-BiIl Watts just called.
-Heard about the bellman?

786
01:40:58,136 --> 01:41:01,305
So did Traveler.

787
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:07,228
They want you to go to San Diego
and assist in the advance.

788
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:10,815
Just like that.

789
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:15,862
lt's not just you against Leary.

790
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:20,491
Have some faith in the rest of us.

791
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:25,496
You know something?

792
01:41:27,749 --> 01:41:31,753
For years l've been Iistening
to all these idiots...

793
01:41:31,961 --> 01:41:36,883
...with their pet theories on Dallas.

794
01:41:37,091 --> 01:41:40,845
lt was the Cubans, or the ClA.

795
01:41:41,053 --> 01:41:44,223
The white supremacists, or the mob.

796
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:49,812
Whether it was one weapon
or whether it was five.

797
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:54,692
None of that meant too much to me.

798
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:59,405
But Leary....

799
01:41:59,614 --> 01:42:04,577
He questioned whether l had the guts
to take that fatal bullet.

800
01:42:07,038 --> 01:42:10,833
God, that was a beautiful day.

801
01:42:13,211 --> 01:42:16,672
The sun was out.

802
01:42:17,381 --> 01:42:20,718
lt had been raining all morning.

803
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:29,352
The first shot
sounded like a firecracker.

804
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:33,731
l looked over and saw him.
l couId telI he was hit.

805
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:40,238
l don't know why l didn't react.

806
01:42:40,446 --> 01:42:45,117
l should've reacted.
l should've been running.

807
01:42:46,536 --> 01:42:50,039
l just couldn't believe it.

808
01:42:53,543 --> 01:42:58,381
lf onIy l'd reacted,
l couId've taken that shot.

809
01:43:03,719 --> 01:43:07,515
lt would've been all right with me.

810
01:43:56,147 --> 01:44:00,234
-What's the number in San Diego?
-619 ukulele.

811
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:04,363
-Ukulele?
-That's how l remember it.

812
01:44:04,572 --> 01:44:08,868
You just push U-K-E-L-E-L-E.

813
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:15,708
-Ukulele? lsn't that U-K-U?
-l don't know.

814
01:44:15,917 --> 01:44:21,172
But the phone number is U-K-E-L-E-L-E.

815
01:44:29,597 --> 01:44:35,770
U-K-E-L. Wait a second.

816
01:44:55,206 --> 01:44:56,248
Jesus.

817
01:44:56,499 --> 01:45:01,087
We have an arrival.
Chopper standing by.

818
01:45:15,393 --> 01:45:19,188
-Southwest Savings, may l help you?
-Southwest?

819
01:45:19,397 --> 01:45:25,027
-Yes. May l help you? Hello?
-What's your address?

820
01:45:30,491 --> 01:45:32,702
Taxi!

821
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:41,085
-Post check. Post 3?
-ln place.

822
01:45:41,293 --> 01:45:43,838
-Post 6?
-ln place.

823
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:46,799
-Post 12?
-ln pIace.

824
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:55,891
Wait right here.

825
01:45:57,852 --> 01:46:01,313
There's no Leary in our accounts.

826
01:46:01,522 --> 01:46:06,777
Try to imagine him in disguise.
A hat, wigs, that sort of thing.

827
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:13,200
-l haven't been here long.
-Who was here before you?

828
01:46:13,409 --> 01:46:18,122
-Pam Magnus.
-Where can l find her?

829
01:46:20,124 --> 01:46:24,503
She's dead. She was murdered.

830
01:46:56,994 --> 01:47:01,832
-She was murdered.
-They won't cancel.

831
01:47:02,041 --> 01:47:06,337
-Then make the arrival underground.
-They want a big show.

832
01:47:06,545 --> 01:47:10,466
-We need proof.
-How about a dead president?

833
01:47:17,014 --> 01:47:24,021
l'm puIling up aIl the accounts
Pam made, but it'll take time.

834
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:27,024
Fax me the list
as soon as you get them.

835
01:47:30,653 --> 01:47:33,781
AIl agents in position.

836
01:48:38,637 --> 01:48:43,726
-Please step back.
-Empty your pockets.

837
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:48,647
Thank you.

838
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:42,910
You're from Texas, right?

839
01:49:51,001 --> 01:49:55,506
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

840
01:50:08,602 --> 01:50:09,853
l'm sorry?

841
01:51:24,470 --> 01:51:27,973
Frank! Watts is gonna shit
if he sees you!

842
01:51:28,182 --> 01:51:33,562
-Have you got a fax for me?
-Yeah, what is it? What's this about?

843
01:51:37,358 --> 01:51:41,278
What the hell is going on, Frank?

844
01:51:54,875 --> 01:51:57,461
James Carney.

845
01:52:14,144 --> 01:52:16,605
Carney, James.

846
01:52:18,315 --> 01:52:21,610
-Jesus.
-Frank!

847
01:52:39,420 --> 01:52:43,674
-What the heIl is he doing here?
-l don't know.

848
01:52:44,508 --> 01:52:47,970
-Who gave you permission--
-He's here. His name is Carney.

849
01:52:48,137 --> 01:52:53,684
-l want the seating chart.
-Give him the chart.

850
01:53:22,337 --> 01:53:25,424
Gun!

851
01:53:38,312 --> 01:53:41,482
Stop! Put the gun down!

852
01:54:04,588 --> 01:54:05,672
Get down!

853
01:54:12,304 --> 01:54:13,931
Don't shoot!

854
01:54:14,598 --> 01:54:17,809
Get him in the car!

855
01:54:23,857 --> 01:54:25,234
Hold your fire!

856
01:54:33,116 --> 01:54:34,368
Get out of his way!

857
01:54:35,786 --> 01:54:37,704
He's got a hostage!

858
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:49,716
Raines to shooters.
lf you have a shot, take it.

859
01:55:03,063 --> 01:55:04,439
Nice view.

860
01:55:06,066 --> 01:55:12,197
-What's the plan, captain?
-lt's your man. You tell me.

861
01:55:12,406 --> 01:55:18,036
Get me sharpshooters
on the north and west towers.

862
01:55:18,245 --> 01:55:21,748
Take the subject out.

863
01:55:38,473 --> 01:55:40,601
You had the guts.
You took the bulIet.

864
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:47,190
-l broke my damn ribs.
-Sorry, l wasn't aiming at you.

865
01:55:47,566 --> 01:55:52,404
Where the heIl are the shooters?

866
01:55:52,613 --> 01:55:57,743
-West tower in pIace. No lights.
-No shot from the north.

867
01:55:57,951 --> 01:56:01,705
A bullet-proof vest
is a bit of a cheat.

868
01:56:01,872 --> 01:56:06,418
-Otherwise, you pIayed a good game.
-lt's no game, Leary.

869
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:11,214
l was doing my job.
What do we do now?

870
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,259
Do you believe
in the nobility of suicide?

871
01:56:15,302 --> 01:56:16,303
No.

872
01:56:16,470 --> 01:56:20,098
But if you want to blow your head off,
be my guest.

873
01:56:20,307 --> 01:56:26,396
Nicely put, but l don't want
to leave this worId alone.

874
01:56:27,230 --> 01:56:32,235
-West tower, do you have a shot?
-Negative, too dark. Target unclear.

875
01:56:33,654 --> 01:56:40,285
-lt's better to die with a friend.
-Friend? You're a damn killer!

876
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:44,373
l saved your life. You owe me.

877
01:56:44,581 --> 01:56:49,628
-l don't owe you shit.
-l was always honest with you.

878
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:54,925
-Go ahead and shoot.
-lt's Frank. Quiet!

879
01:56:55,133 --> 01:56:58,261
-Come on.
-Are you taIking to me?

880
01:56:58,470 --> 01:57:01,973
-What are you waiting for?
-Waiting for?

881
01:57:02,182 --> 01:57:06,019
l'm waiting for some gratitude.

882
01:57:06,269 --> 01:57:10,816
Without me, you're a sad-eyed,
piano-playing drunk.

883
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:14,903
l brought you into this game.
l let you keep up with me.

884
01:57:15,362 --> 01:57:18,824
-l made you a hero today.
-You didn't make me anything.

885
01:57:19,032 --> 01:57:21,952
l redeemed your pathetic life.

886
01:57:22,202 --> 01:57:25,163
l just did my job.
You're the one with a pathetic Iife.

887
01:57:25,372 --> 01:57:30,335
-Go ahead and shoot!
-lf they fire you'll be hit.

888
01:57:30,627 --> 01:57:34,464
-l want you to thank me first.
-Shut up and shoot.

889
01:57:34,631 --> 01:57:36,299
AIl right, Frank.

890
01:57:39,469 --> 01:57:43,473
-AlI right, Frank.
-Stand by to fire on my command.

891
01:57:45,350 --> 01:57:49,354
-Sleep welI, my friend.
-Just one thing, aim high.

892
01:57:49,563 --> 01:57:52,065
-What?
-Aim high!

893
01:57:52,315 --> 01:57:54,401
-Now!
-You bastard!

894
01:58:46,369 --> 01:58:50,290
Take my hand.
lf you don't, you'll die.

895
01:58:50,499 --> 01:58:58,423
-You want to save me, Frank?
-To be honest, no. But it's my job.

896
01:59:04,304 --> 01:59:06,890
Take it.

897
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:05,323
Are you okay?

898
02:00:08,869 --> 02:00:11,997
We've worked with Agent Horrigan
for some time.

899
02:00:12,163 --> 02:00:16,960
He exempIifies
courage and self-sacrifice. Frank!

900
02:00:17,711 --> 02:00:21,840
l guess l overreacted again, Harry.

901
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:46,865
Agent Horrigan, why are you
retiring from the Secret Service?

902
02:00:47,032 --> 02:00:51,411
WelI, l hate desk work and l'm
too old for running around.

903
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:57,626
And thanks to all this press,
l'm no good for undercover work.

904
02:00:58,585 --> 02:01:04,132
How are you, Frank?
The President sent his limo for you.

905
02:01:04,341 --> 02:01:08,345
-That's the least he couId do.
-Good. l love public transportation.

906
02:01:12,057 --> 02:01:15,101
Come on in.

907
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:19,856
Make yourseIf at home.

908
02:01:31,368 --> 02:01:35,997
-So, what do you think?
-l like it.

909
02:01:36,164 --> 02:01:42,754
Hello, Frank. By the time
you hear this, it'll be over.

910
02:01:42,963 --> 02:01:48,218
The President is most likely dead
and so am l.

911
02:01:48,426 --> 02:01:55,892
Frank, did you kill me? Who won
our game? Not that it matters.

912
02:01:56,101 --> 02:01:59,980
Among friends, like you and me,
it's how you play the game.

913
02:02:00,146 --> 02:02:02,899
The game's done.

914
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:06,069
lt's time to get on with your life.

915
02:02:06,236 --> 02:02:11,241
l worry that
you have no life to get on with.

916
02:02:11,408 --> 02:02:14,494
You're a good man.

917
02:02:14,703 --> 02:02:18,832
Good men, like you and me,
are destined to travel a lonely road.

918
02:02:19,874 --> 02:02:23,086
Goodbye and good luck.

919
02:02:27,090 --> 02:02:32,262
l bet you that brown pigeon
fIies off before the white one.

920
02:02:32,429 --> 02:02:35,181
How do you know?

921
02:02:35,432 --> 02:02:40,603
l know things about pigeons, LilIy.
