Hey, did you see Ironside last night?
Some show.

No, last night I read.

18
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,797
You know,
he's in a wheelchair all the time.

19
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,924
And, uh, he gets this case
with this rich lady-

20
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:49,934
very beautiful, blonde.

21
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:52,004

wants to kill her.

- Poison her.
- I thought you said you didn't watch.

00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,276
Well, the husband
usually chooses poison.

24
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:59,811
He takes the case,
and they got this scene where Ironside...

25
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:03,110
has got to get to the woman in time
to grab the poison from out of her hand.

in the life of a cat.

Eating is the most important thing
in the life of me too.

I stand in awe.
What's his secret?

43
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,798
I don't know. Maybe 'cause
he still lives in Puerto Rico.

44
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,202
Maybe because, uh, he eats
a lot of, uh, bananas.

45
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,366
- Bananas?
- Maybe because he don't know he's 82.

I mean, if it was a small car...

67
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,753
would it make the fellow
not a capitalist?

- I was mugged.

- White boy or black boy?
- What the hell difference does it make?

- I just like to know, that's all.
- White.

If it makes you feel any better,
the last one was Puerto Rican.

- You got it?

A fella I know up in Harlem...

112
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,042
got his false teeth stolen.

00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,820
The mugger put a knife behind him...

115
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,855
scared him so...

116
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,393
his dentures dropped
clear out of his mouth.

117
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:18,828
Mugger grabbed his wallet
and his teeth.

Who could argue with her?

162
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,335
It was like Shakespeare's London.

You had to hand-crank

Those were names fit for a car.

00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:22,997
Mustangs, Jaguars, Cougars-

179
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,272
Pintos.

180
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,471
Silly.

181
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,151
I used to drive Burt around
on his paper route.

182
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:38,087
Yeah, we had
paper routes in those days.

183
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,658
Get him up early in the morning.

184
00:12:42,895 --> 00:12:45,659
Help the boy
make some pocket money.

185
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,336
It's a wonderful neighborhood.

186
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,840
It's run-down.

187
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,212
It's running down.

188
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,476
It all runs down sooner or later.

189
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,248
Where would I go to live?

190
00:13:16,862 --> 00:13:19,353
I still know a lot of people
around here, Tonto.

191
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,868
You know people...

192
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,939
that's home.

193
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:35,106
[Yawning]

194
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:42,354
[Siren Wailing]

195
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:53,964
Get a job, folks.

196
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,397
[Officer On Loudspeaker]
We know you're in there, Mr. Combes...

197
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,236
and we ask you in a nice way
to please come down of your own volition.

198
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,810
You're only making things
worse for yourself.

199
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:10,610
- I repeat, you're only making
things worse for yourself.
- Why don't you use tear gas?

200
00:14:10,716 --> 00:14:13,048
- Fire a cannon!
- We repeat, Mr. Combes-

201
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:15,586
- Shoot in the workers'houses.!
- You are endangering your own life...

202
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,713
- as well as the lives of many other people.
- Bastard.!

203
00:14:17,823 --> 00:14:19,916
Please come down.

204
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:24,189
The city of New York will guarantee you
replacement housing, Mr. Combes.

205
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:27,754
Please, sir,
come on out of your apartment.

206
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,028
You are costing the city
valuable tax dollars.

207
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,195
[Jacob]
Arrest the whole West Side.!

208
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:36,638
Don't you touch me.!

209
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,642
Fascist bastard!

210
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,042
- You can't park there.
- [Jacob] Fascist.!

211
00:14:41,146 --> 00:14:44,604
- Hey, you hear what I said? You can't park there!
- That's my father!

212
00:14:45,684 --> 00:14:47,584
Oh, Pop.

213
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,783
"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks!

214
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,985
- "Rage! Blow! You cataracts and hurricanes-
- Get the furniture!

215
00:14:55,094 --> 00:14:56,721
But he's in a "No Parking" zone.

216
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,729
- I said, get the furniture!
- "Spout till you have...

217
00:14:58,831 --> 00:15:00,458
drench'd our steeples,
drown'd the cocks!"

218
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,399
- Drown the cocks, baby!
- Pop, I want you to act your age.

219
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:06,369
I am. "You sulphurous,
thought-executing fires...

220
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:09,066
"vaunt-couriers
to oak-cleaving thunderbolts.

221
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,074
Singe my white head!"

222
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,077
Pop, I want you
to come home with me.

223
00:15:14,179 --> 00:15:18,912
- This is my home.
- Pop, you've exhausted all your legal means.

224
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,987
Not my moral means. Not-
The mugger.

225
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:24,078
The mugger.
That boy mugged me!

226
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:27,124
That's the boy that mugged me.!

227
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,923
I've been thinking about Lear
these past few weeks.

228
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,098
I'm talkin' to you, Burt.

229
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,532
I'm- I'm listening, Pop.

230
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,570
What'd I say?

231
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:14,605
You said you were
thinking about Lear.

232
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,676
- Lear who?
- I don't know, Pop.

233
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:19,835
King Lear.

234
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,505
He gave up his real estate too.

235
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,816
You know what happened to him...

236
00:16:25,918 --> 00:16:28,386
what they did to him?

237
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,387
They foreclosed.

238
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:33,988
That's life.

239
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:37,392
An old man loses his home...

240
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,930
he's just a wanderer.

241
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:42,933
You got a home now, Pop.

242
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:06,050
Will you pass the salad, please?

243
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:29,908
[Tonto Meows]

244
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,746
[Screeching, Hissing]

245
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:44,892
He's nervous about
the new surroundings.

246
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:48,262
- It's just a matter of time, Pop.
- We have Brown Betty for dessert.

247
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:50,130
Fine, fine.

248
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,999
How about some Brown Betty, Norman, hmm?

249
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:56,074
- You can chew on that for a couple of weeks.
- Leave him alone, Burt.

250
00:17:58,877 --> 00:18:01,505
All right. Okay.

251
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:03,740
Okay. Okay.

252
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,749
[Sighs]

253
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:13,123
See you in a few minutes, kid.

254
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,125
Hope you like the vibes.

255
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:18,355
[Meows]

256
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:21,092
- Yeah, he's bothering me.
- I wish you would just eat your own food.

257
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,100
What is it supposed to do?
I don't know.

258
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,397
Listen, I've got as m- l-

259
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,768
I know as much about
political consciousness as Norman does.

260
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,000
- I just want a little respect.
- You'll be out of here soon enough.

261
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,236
- When I talk to him, I wanna get answers.
- He doesn't answer me.

262
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:35,040
- Why should he answer you?
- Because we're in the same generation, that's why!

263
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:37,809
What's the problem?

264
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:40,714
It's my brother, and he's insane.
That's the problem.

265
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,583
- I don't like that, Burt.
- Hey.

266
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,658
You may have noticed, Dad,
that Norman doesn't speak very much.

267
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,225
[Scoffs]
Much?

268
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:51,125
He's taken a vow of silence.

269
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:54,199
I know. He wrote me a note.

270
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,392
Rather interesting.

271
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,970
I've done considerable reading
about Zen, yoga.

272
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:01,562
He hasn't.

273
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:04,870
I don't understand
that diet he's on though.

274
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,706
Macrobiotics.

275
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:10,506
Well, he seems healthy.

276
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:12,516
Maybe you oughta
give it a try, Elaine.

277
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,485
What is that supposed to mean?

278
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:18,579
Well, I think you've
put on a little weight.

279
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,557
[Chuckles]

280
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,594
I think that's very rude.

281
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,323
Oh, l- I apologize.

282
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:28,331
I know you think
you're really far out.

283
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:31,334
You smoke a couple of joints, and you think
you're into something, right?

284
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,336
No. Hey, I know.

285
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:35,963
I mean, I took 32 trips, you ninny.

286
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,974
Pure stuff. Pure rainbow.

287
00:19:38,076 --> 00:19:41,204
I have more coke stuffed up
this nose than you could breathe air.

288
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:45,511
I was into heavy Tibetan meditation
for two years, you Jimbo!

289
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,517
You're not very tolerant, Junior.

290
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,747
The heaviest thing I can do for him
is to wake him up!

291
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,039
You do that one more time, Burt...

292
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:12,668
and I'll stuff something up your nose!

293
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:15,542
And you-y-y-you take
that mackerel rice and- and-

294
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:17,547
Change your shirt.!

295
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:20,709
- [Elaine] This is a wonderful dinner for Pop.
- [Burt] I've had it up to here.!

296
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,720
- Roast beef and all.!
- And I cooked it.!

297
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,320
- [Norman] Okay. Okay.
- [Rustling]

298
00:20:35,167 --> 00:20:37,067
[Groans]

299
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,003
[Coughs]

300
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,878
You spoke.

301
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,607
In your sleep you said,
"Okay, okay."

302
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,615
[Chuckles]

303
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,817
[Coughing]

304
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,161
[Meows]

305
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,475
Humphrey Bogart.

306
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,485
Sorry, Pop.

307
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,489
We've had a lot of robberies
in the neighborhood lately.

308
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,491
- That thing real?
- Yeah.

309
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,493
Sorry.

310
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,495
Burt, you'll have
to get used to me.

311
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:40,497
I get up once a night to go.

312
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:44,831
Listen, you can go 10 times
a night if you want. All right?

313
00:21:44,936 --> 00:21:46,904
You promise you won't shoot me?

314
00:21:47,005 --> 00:21:49,974
We're glad to have you here, Pop.

315
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:52,543
Okay, go to sleep.
Get some sleep.

316
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,292
Oh, that's okay.

317
00:22:18,403 --> 00:22:20,769
[Coughs]

318
00:22:20,872 --> 00:22:22,931
Let's talk for a few minutes.

319
00:22:25,577 --> 00:22:28,171
Okay. I'll talk and you nod.

320
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:33,410
Norman, is there any literature...

321
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,043
specifically relating to what you're doing?

322
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,524
I'd like to read them.

323
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:51,124
I've never done anything
quite so extreme.

324
00:22:52,738 --> 00:22:54,831
I'm not against it.

325
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:57,135
Not as long as it's growth-promoting.

326
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,309
Now, when I was your age...

327
00:23:02,414 --> 00:23:04,712
I did a lot of foolish things.

328
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,953
Have you taken any of these drugs?

329
00:23:15,794 --> 00:23:17,694
Mescaline?

330
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,133
Peyote?

331
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,103
Psilocybin?

332
00:23:29,775 --> 00:23:31,675
L.S.D.?

333
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,813
Heroin?

334
00:23:41,052 --> 00:23:42,952
You're a good boy, Norman.

335
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,624
Norman...

336
00:23:47,726 --> 00:23:50,957
is there any way you could describe...

337
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,121
just how you feel?

338
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,841
Good night.

339
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:11,408
A fellow from Armenia
just became a father at the age of 93.

340
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,416
He must eat a lot of bananas.

341
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:17,045
He says he smokes and he drinks...

342
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,646
and he still works in the fields.

343
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:24,354
- When did you last have a woman, Jacob?
- What?

344
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,988
When did you last
sleep with a woman?

345
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,135
Saturday night.

346
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,139
March, 1951.

347
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:40,803
Yeah, it was about 10:00 at night.

348
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,710
[Chuckles]
You have a wonderful memory.

349
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:48,317
I also remember the first time.

350
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,184
I was 14 years old.

351
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,951
[Chuckles]

352
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,360
It was snowing.

353
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,258
It was snowing.

354
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,524
Bitter cold. Twenty below.

355
00:24:59,631 --> 00:25:02,862
Maybe worse.

356
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:05,835
Winters in Poland-

357
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:09,338
Your piss would freeze
before it hit the ground.

358
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:12,376
[Laughing]
Yeah. But, Harry...

359
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:16,504
I went into the barn
to get some wood.

360
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:22,383
Mmm, some firewood,
and we had this- this servant girl.

361
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,580
Annushka.

362
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:29,054
Uh, she- she was already 20.

363
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,421
Oh, she was, uh-

364
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,726
she was milking the cow.

365
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:39,736
Uh, she had tits...

366
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,806
bigger than the cow.

367
00:25:41,907 --> 00:25:45,968
Cold as it was,
I was burning for her, and she knew it.

368
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,208
Ah, Annushka.

369
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,945
Then my father came in and found us...

370
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,047
and he almost killed me.

371
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,059
Did you ever have Annushka again?

372
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:05,061
No. No.

373
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:09,031
My father started
slipping it to her regularly.

374
00:26:09,134 --> 00:26:12,934
- Polish logic.
- He was a capitalist bastard!

375
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,266
We are in for a depression...

376
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,777
that will make the '30s
look like paradise.

377
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,110
Maybe it's a good thing.

378
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:28,242
The hard-hats and the phony liberals
will kill each other.

379
00:26:43,468 --> 00:26:46,460
## [Pop]

380
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:54,644
[Claps]

381
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:04,112
## [Humming Along]

382
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:08,391
Play my song.

383
00:27:09,427 --> 00:27:11,327
[Chuckling]

384
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,094
Yea!

385
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,932
#We will raise a family #

386
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:22,700
- #A gal for you #
- #And a boy for me #

387
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:26,243
# Can't you see how happy
we will be ##

388
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:31,505
- Yea. Terrific!
- [Cheering]

389
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,715
Well, that was fabulous.
Thank you. That was great.

390
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,347
- Yeah, that meal was fabulous.
- Oh.

391
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:42,358
I was gonna try to cook
some authentic soul food...

392
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,690
but then I got afraid
it wouldn't turn out all right.

393
00:27:44,796 --> 00:27:48,095
- That's fine. Fine.
- But I love the soul food.

394
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,360
Burt and I ate it at a little place...

395
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,368
in the East Village
that specializes in it.

396
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,370
- Do you remember, Burt?
- Hmm?

397
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:56,531
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that-
that tiny place, yeah.

398
00:27:56,641 --> 00:28:00,202
It's run by
an elderly Afro-American woman.

399
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:03,872
- I didn't know they had soul food in Africa.
- Pass the wine, Junior.

400
00:28:03,982 --> 00:28:06,416
- It was a fabulous meal.
- Thank you.

401
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,986
- We had grits, black-eyed peas...
- Ooh.

402
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,987
Okra and pig's knuckle.

403
00:28:11,089 --> 00:28:15,822
I got pig knuckles runnin' outta my ears.
My mother makes 'em every night.

404
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,395
Leroy's living with
his mother temporarily.

405
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:21,192
- That's wonderful.
- I don't know about that.

406
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,631
She nags me from morning till night.

407
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:27,193
"Get a job. Get a job.
Go out and get yourself a job!"

408
00:28:27,305 --> 00:28:29,398
She's gettin' meaner and meaner.

409
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,135
- How old is your mother?
- Ninety.

410
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:35,212
She's riled because she's workin'
and I'm not.

411
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:39,374
Well, she must be an extraordinary woman
to be able to work at that age.

412
00:28:39,484 --> 00:28:41,645
Well, she does cleaning
two days a week.

413
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,778
Isn't that fantastic?

414
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:47,881
[Leroy Chuckles]
It's not as if I'm not tryin'.

415
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:51,325
I go out every day trying to find
another janitorial job.

416
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:53,897
They're tearin' down more buildings
than they're building up.

417
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,558
Right. Well, listen, have you tried
the, uh, unemployment office?

418
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,761
They tore down
the one in our area.

419
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:01,100
I'm going downtown
to the main office tomorrow.

420
00:29:01,206 --> 00:29:04,232
- What about welfare?
- My mother's on welfare.

421
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:05,900
I thought you said
she was working.

422
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,638
Welfare don't know she's working.

423
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:11,113
Besides, that's scratch for me.

424
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,083
- It's better than nothing.
- [Leroy] For her, it is.

425
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:16,085
She won't give me a dime.

426
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:18,087
You're missing the point, Junior.

427
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:20,453
Leroy wants a place of his own.

428
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:22,458
It doesn't make any difference
how old a man is...

429
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,460
he needs his privacy.

430
00:29:24,562 --> 00:29:26,530
Are you saying that you don't
have enough privacy?

431
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:30,567
- Elaine.
- I'm talking to your father.

432
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:32,863
I think we're doing
the very best that we can.

433
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,997
I would like it if you could have
a room of your own...

434
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,768
but we're not millionaires.

435
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:39,639
That's a very stupid remark, Elaine.

436
00:29:39,744 --> 00:29:42,144
It's not a stupid remark, Burt.

437
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,715
Elaine's just being honest about it.

438
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:48,980
Well, it- it isn't very easy
to accommodate another person.

439
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,783
Especially when the person
is as unaccommodating as I am.

440
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,619
Let's just drop the discussion.

441
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:57,491
I'm old and cranky and just a general
all-around pain in the butt.

442
00:29:57,595 --> 00:30:00,962
- Now, I didn't say that.
- Hey, I'm gettin'married in the spring...

443
00:30:01,065 --> 00:30:03,260
- so Grandpa can have my room.
- I may be dead by the spring.

444
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:06,064
- Pop.
- Look, I'll find a place of my own this week.

445
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,230
Nobody is asking you to move.

446
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:10,364
We love havin' you here, Pop.

447
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,966
You're a fool, Burt.

448
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:15,875
I'm driving Elaine out ofher mind.

449
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,210
Every second I spend here
is a burden to her.

450
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:22,776
Well, l- I can't see your other children
sending out invitations.

451
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,879
I don't see the mail pouring in
from Chicago or Los Angeles.

452
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,288
Elaine, will you shut up?

453
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,700
Well, thanks for a lovely evening.

454
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,710
I think I best be going home.

455
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,712
I'll see you out, Leroy.

456
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:53,516
[Groans]

457
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:20,044
I don't promise
the elevator will ever work.

458
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:22,237
A little exercise is good at our age.

459
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,372
I don't think it's safe anyway.

460
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,382
Best place to get mugged
is the elevator.

461
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,509
I was mugged four times this year.

462
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,953
- You must live in a good neighborhood.
- I lived in this area.

463
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,321
- Where are you now?
- In the suburbs with my son.

464
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,494
Let's wait a second, huh?

465
00:31:38,596 --> 00:31:41,827
- I'm glad you said it.
- [Sighs] How old do you think I am?

466
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,833
We both can use an elevator.

467
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:45,835
How old?

468
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,928
- Oh, 60, 64.
- [Scoffs]

469
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,473
When I was 64
I could run up those stairs.

470
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:53,135
- Seventy-three.
- Amazing. You don't look it.

471
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:55,337
I feel it.

472
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,574
He'll be outta here
the end of the week.

473
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,484
- Excuse me. Buenos días.
- Buenos días.

474
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,524
The owner will split
the paint job with you.

475
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,719
- A little small, isn't it?
- Less to clean.

476
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,728
What do you want a big place for?

477
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,162
You're not gonna give any big parties.

478
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,166
A room with a view.

479
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:20,760
At our age, if you don't know
what the world looks like, you never will.

480
00:32:20,872 --> 00:32:22,772
- How much?
- Hundred and 20.

481
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,638
- You pay the utilities.
- It's a steal.

482
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,643
Well, you gotta know how to shop.

483
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:31,545
Me? [Scoffs]
I could get along on just toast and tea...

484
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,140
as long as I have
my chocolate bars.

485
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:38,916
My husband's the problem.
He loves his meat.

486
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:41,617
Been in the hospital
for five weeks now.

487
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:44,627
I've heard from him
about three times.

488
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:47,323
Every time I call,
they say, "He'll pull through,"

489
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:49,662
but they never tell me
when he's comin' home.

490
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,702
I never miss him when he's home.

491
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,204
But I miss him a lot
when he's in the hospital.

492
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,571
Lfhe were here,
I'd have someone to argue with.

493
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,406
I'd find him a nice piece of meat.

494
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,211
- I have a pet.
- Huh?

495
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,877
- I have a pussycat.
- Why the hell are you wasting my time?

496
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:10,887
No cats. No dogs.

497
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,889
No animals. Get out of here!

498
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,235
Have you got 35 cents?

499
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,362
- [Horns Honking]
- Why 35?

500
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,441
I want to buy a mink coat.

501
00:33:30,541 --> 00:33:32,441
[Honking Continues]

502
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,146
- There you are.
- Ah, thank you. Thank you.

503
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,478
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

504
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,344
I think I'll go to Chicago.

505
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,424
Spend a few weeks with Shirley.

506
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,619
Pop, it's freezing in Chicago.

507
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,719
I want to see her.

508
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,730
Besides, I think it'd be good for all of us...

509
00:33:54,832 --> 00:33:57,300
to have a little vacation from each other.

510
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,136
I called Shirley yesterday.
It's all set.

511
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,265
Why didn't you tell me that, Pop?

512
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,969
- How is she?
- She sounded fine.

513
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:08,978
Sends you her love.

514
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,947
I think you're makin'
a big mistake, Pop.

515
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,446
Uh, just double-park, Burt.

516
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,784
I'll do this myself.

517
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,564
Pop, at least let me
buy the plane ticket.

518
00:34:27,665 --> 00:34:29,656
You promise I won't get hijacked?

519
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,634
- Promise.
- Okay.

520
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,932
I guess I'm a little scared of flying.

521
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,064
You'll love it.

522
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,336
You're a good boy, Burt.

523
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,469
I'll only be a few minutes.

524
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,479
[Door Closes]

525
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,845
[Phone Ringing]

526
00:34:57,628 --> 00:35:01,029
- This is a 40-minute trip for me.
- Look, there is no Reynolds.

527
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:05,398
Found in a bathtub
in Jackson Heights.

528
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:09,530
- I want an autopsy today,
and I want an autopsy by noon.
- There is a Renaldo, Rivera-

529
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,540
That's it. That's it, Renaldo.

530
00:35:11,642 --> 00:35:13,610
He's Reynolds. Reynolds!

531
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,111
Christ Almighty.

532
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,239
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

533
00:35:18,349 --> 00:35:20,544
I came here to identify a body.

534
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,916
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

535
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,854
- Name?
- Combes.

536
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,359
- [Man] They got Renaldo.
- [Humming]

537
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:35,293
- I don't have any Combes.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

538
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,334
I'm Combes. Rivetowski-

539
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:40,802
Jacob Rivetowski.

540
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,642
- 3014 Amsterdam Avenue?
- That's right.

541
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,579
- Well, what is your relationship to him?
- I was his friend.

542
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:54,412
Well, I'm sorry.
You have to be a blood relative.

543
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:59,013
Well, you'll have to go to Poland
to find a blood relative.

544
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:01,648
Do you know
his social security number?

545
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:06,729
Well, he hasn't worked
in 20, 25 years.

546
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,731
What is his date of birth?

547
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,825
Well, he claimed to be 77 years old.

548
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,531
But if you ask me,
I think he was older.

549
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,540
You know, at that age
they get a little vain.

550
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,338
Do you have any documents?

551
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,345
No.

552
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:26,848
Madam, I just want to
get my friend buried.

553
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,188
Come with me.

554
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,712
That's him.

555
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,521
So long, kid.

556
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,294
Take your time.

557
00:37:18,803 --> 00:37:21,397
He had his first affair
when he was 14.

558
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,337
Okay.

559
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:32,348
Thank you.

560
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,089
[Sniffs]

561
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:51,159
Uh, he's taking
the 403 to Chicago.

562
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,771
You go right on through
to gate 28.

563
00:37:56,941 --> 00:37:58,841
All right, uh-

564
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,345
- Here you go, mate.
- All right. Thank you.

565
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,539
- Can I take that for you?
- No. No. No, thanks.

566
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,976
Burt, I don't like long good-byes.

567
00:38:09,086 --> 00:38:11,418
Pop, here.

568
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,422
I want you to enjoy yourself.

569
00:38:13,524 --> 00:38:17,016
- Burt, I have enough money.
- If I know Shirley, you'll need it.

570
00:38:18,162 --> 00:38:20,062
All right. Thank you.

571
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,691
Now listen, you know you got a place here,
you understand?

572
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,996
Fine. Fine.
Now, if anything should happen to me-

573
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,004
- Oh, what are you talkin' about?
- Well, just a minute.

574
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:33,975
You never know. My lawyer is Herb Appleby
of Appleby, Ross and Montgomery.

575
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,876
They have my will,
my safe deposit key.

576
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,040
- Thanks, Burt. Thanks for everything.
- Now listen.

577
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:41,880
- You-You call me as soon
as you get there, all right?
- Okay. Okay.

578
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,886
Okay.

579
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:02,534
- [Tonto Meowing]
- Don't worry, Tonto.

580
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,165
Nobody's gonna touch you.
Just lookin' for time bombs.

581
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,176
Hey, mister, don't even joke like that.

582
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,542
- [Man On P.A.] Trans World Airlines-
- They gonna search my cat?

583
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:12,138
- They search everything.
- [Man On P.A. Continues, Indistinct]

584
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:15,480
- Relax. Nobody's gonna-
- Please step through.

585
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:18,987
- Would you please step through?
- Should I turn my hearing aid off?

586
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,285
- Should I turn my hearing aid off?
- No, no, that's okay.

587
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:23,758
- But let me have the case, please.
- No, it's only my cat.

588
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,886
You have to
step through alone, sir.

589
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:28,328
I don't step through anything
without this cat.

590
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:30,798
Sir, it's government regulations.

591
00:39:30,901 --> 00:39:34,029
Are you telling me I can't get on
that plane if I don't let go of this cat?

592
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:38,131
Sir, we have to examine
every parcel that is hand-carried.

593
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:41,769
Well, this parcel contains
one cat, one piece of shag rug...

594
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:42,880
a rubber "mousy,"
and about a half a pound of kitty litter.

595
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,745
A rubber "mousy,"
and about a half a pound of kitty litter.

596
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:47,374
- [Meows]
- Wet kitty litter.

597
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,612
Sir, you're holding up the line.

598
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,450
What the hell do you think
I've got in here, a submachine gun?

599
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,581
- Sir, would you come this way, please?
- What?

600
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,660
I said I'd like to talk
to you here for a minute.

601
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:58,752
- Where?
- I would like to talk to you.

602
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:01,697
This way.

603
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:07,232
I want my bag back!

604
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:10,364
- That was a short trip.
- It's the brown job with the black strap.

605
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,477
Taxi!

606
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,479
Taxi!

607
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,855
- Where can I get a bus to Chicago?
- At the bus station.

608
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:29,016
How much does it cost
to go to the bus station?

609
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:32,152
- About 10 bucks.
- It's a deal.

610
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,356
There we go.

611
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:54,874
It's not far, is it?
My cat is thirsty.

612
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,681
- Oh, is that a cat in there, sir?
- Yeah.

613
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,689
I'm gonna have to charge you for it
as if it was luggage.

614
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,191
All right.

615
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,387
Hey, are you a salesman?

616
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:09,796
Yeah. I'm one of the last
of your traveling salesmen.

617
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,391
We don't see many
of you fellas anymore.

618
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:14,471
We're a dying breed.

619
00:41:14,572 --> 00:41:17,166
- What do you sell?
- Cats.

620
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,708
Oh, is that so?

621
00:41:20,911 --> 00:41:23,436
Let me tell you something.

622
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:27,643
Times are bad. Don't you believe
what they're saying in the papers about a recession.

623
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:31,152
- We're in a depression.
- You better believe it.

624
00:41:31,255 --> 00:41:34,224
Time was when
I could go into a town...

625
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,021
sell six or seven cats
before lunchtime.

626
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,722
Siamese, Burmese, Manx, Persian.

627
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:42,856
Hey, my mom had a Persian.

628
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,458
Russian blue, chocolate...

629
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:48,436
calico, rex.

630
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:50,063
What's a rex?

631
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,837
See what I mean?
People don't know cats anymore.

632
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,912
A rex is a 20-pounder.

633
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:59,676
Geez, it must cost an arm and a leg
to feed that thing.

634
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,478
That's why nobody buys them anymore.

635
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:08,919
But Chicago- great town for cats.

636
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,427
Why is Chicago a great town for cats?

637
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,556
I don't know. It just is.

638
00:42:38,289 --> 00:42:40,917
Excuse me.

639
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:43,619
I thought since we're gonna be
traveling companions...

640
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,627
we ought to at least
know each other.

641
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,332
Harry Combes.

642
00:42:50,434 --> 00:42:52,664
Dominic Santosi.

643
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,670
Glad to know you, Dominic.

644
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,507
Quite a sandwich you have there.

645
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:07,074
I've often wondered if the derivation
of the phrase "hero sandwich"...

646
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,277
- [Meows]
- Comes from the word "heroic."

647
00:43:13,123 --> 00:43:16,058
The adjective "heroic"
can be taken to mean...

648
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,526
gallant, courageous, brave.

649
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:24,929
It can also mean huge, large.

650
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:28,996
You want a bite?

651
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,006
My- My cat is hungry.

652
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:37,012
Thank you.

653
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:41,108
You, uh, take this trip often?

654
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,451
I'm going to Chicago.

655
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:47,456
Visit my daughter.

656
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,387
What does one do about urinating?

657
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:58,032
There's a john in the back.

658
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,035
Thank you, Dom.

659
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:13,348
Eh.

660
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,544
[Meows, Screeches]

661
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,851
I didn't think so.

662
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:33,435
- Uh, excuse me.
- Sorry, you can't talk to the driver...

663
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,995
- while the bus is in motion.
- Uh, my cat has to relieve himself.

664
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:39,598
You're not supposed to have
any animals on the vehicle.

665
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,873
Look, this is an animal,
and he's on this vehicle, and he has to go.

666
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,880
How did you get
that cat on this bus?

667
00:44:44,982 --> 00:44:48,418
- I carried him on in his case.
What difference does it make?
- Then let him pee in his case.

668
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,488
He doesn't want to pee in his case.
His litter is soiled.

669
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:55,183
A cat is a very clean animal. He doesn't like
to make where another animal has made.

670
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,022
I can't stop this bus, mister!

671
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,028
Listen, driver, you better stop this bus...

672
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,564
or my cat is gonna do
his business on somebody's leg!

673
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,939
- You got one minute.
- Thank you.

674
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:16,444
Thank you.
[Grunts]

675
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,884
Okay. Hurry it up, kiddo.

676
00:45:21,985 --> 00:45:23,885
Hurry it up. Come on.

677
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,978
Hurry it up.

678
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,585
Tonto! Tonto!

679
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,965
Tonto.!

680
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,338
Tonto.!

681
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,340
Tonto!

682
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:48,002
Hey, Tonto!

683
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:50,012
Tonto!

684
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:54,849
Tonto!

685
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:57,512
Tonto!

686
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:19,402
Hey, mister, let's go!
I can't wait!

687
00:46:19,510 --> 00:46:22,001
Let's go! I'm gonna lose my job!

688
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,603
I can't leave without my cat.

689
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,615
I can't hold this ride up.
We're an express.

690
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:29,777
All right. Get- Get my bag.
It's the brown job with the black strap.

691
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:33,482
- I can't leave you out here.
- I will not leave without my cat!

692
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:37,458
There's another bus due in about
an hour and a half. You could flag her down.

693
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:41,156
- Okay, just get my bag.
- All right, I'll get it.

694
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,036
- Is this it?
- Yes, that's it. Put it down.

695
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,038
Tonto!

696
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,040
Tonto.

697
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:09,818
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all, you rotten cat!

698
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,827
You half-scared
the life outta me!

699
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,898
I tell you, Tonto,
I don't like your attitude.

700
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:19,668
- [Meows]
- All right.

701
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,670
You don't want to be
on those buses, do you?

702
00:47:21,772 --> 00:47:23,967
You want to be free, don't ya?

703
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,478
I left your case on the bus.

704
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:32,105
Well, that's show business.

705
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,291
[Meows]

706
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,055
Okay. Okay.
[Kisses] You're all right.

707
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,897
- [Meows]
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

708
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,264
- [Meows]
- Okay. That's better.

709
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:58,740
[Groans]
Okay, baby.

710
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,811
Well, good afternoon. Nick Lewis.

711
00:48:01,912 --> 00:48:04,346
Harry Combes.

712
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:09,044
- Car trouble?
- Oh, it's a long story.

713
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:12,087
I need something
to get me to Chicago.

714
00:48:13,123 --> 00:48:15,023
Oh, boy.

715
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,959
- Over here.
- [Grunts]

716
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,823
Now, this little baby
only come in yesterday.

717
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,867
Fresh rubber.
Power steering. Power brakes.

718
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,665
Got your factory air.
Got your reclining seats. The works.

719
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,139
And I guarantee you,
it's only had one owner.

720
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,506
- A little old lady.
- [Chuckles] No. Little old me.

721
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:36,511
- Oh.
- This used to be my car.

722
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:39,343
- Yeah, but my days for reclining seats are over.
- Yeah.

723
00:48:39,449 --> 00:48:42,077
Oh, every now and then
I knock off a little piece...

724
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:45,348
but it gets tougher
all the time, you know?

725
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,548
I never would have believed it.

726
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,785
I am 62 years old.

727
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:56,930
I can't get it up
unless I take a dose of strychnine.

728
00:48:57,034 --> 00:49:00,333
Strychnine? I thought
strychnine was poisonous.

729
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,905
Naw. No.

730
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:05,236
It really gives you a lift, you know?

731
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,276
But I wanna tell ya, it isn't worth it.

732
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:10,141
'Cause I get such terrible headaches.

733
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:14,047
Right through my skull.
"Bong! Bong!" Like a sledgehammer.

734
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,949
So, a fella has to decide
whether he wants a migraine headache...

735
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,954
or a piece of ass, you know?

736
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,422
- Well, Nick, you live and learn.
- Yeah.

737
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:24,153
Well, here.

738
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:27,059
Now, uh- Now here,
we're talking about...

739
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,758
an automatic transmission,
but no passing power.

740
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:31,834
- Uh-
- Will you hold Tonto, please?

741
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:33,835
Yeah.

742
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,555
How much?

743
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,719
Let's call it 250,
including tax and license.

744
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,593
It's all-American.
[Chuckles]

745
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:04,132
[Harry]
Hello?

746
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:06,668
E-Elaine?

747
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,897
Uh, this is Harry.

748
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:11,497
Yes. Would you speak-

749
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,667
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

750
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,747
Hello?

751
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,283
I can hear you now.

752
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:24,445
Yeah, well, uh-
Let me speak to Burt.

753
00:50:24,554 --> 00:50:27,114
Okay.

754
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,215
Uh, Burt?

755
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:32,090
Oh, I'm fine.

756
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,925
No, I'm not in Chicago.

757
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:37,933
L-I'm in a motel
eating fried chicken.

758
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:42,131
No, I didn't take the plane.
I took a bus.

759
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:44,298
But Tonto wouldn't pee
on the bus...

760
00:50:44,408 --> 00:50:46,740
so I went out and bought a car.

761
00:50:48,311 --> 00:50:51,678
Yes, it's a good car. Safe- $250.

762
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:54,876
I don't know what year.
It's a good, safe car.

763
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:58,148
Yeah. Huh?

764
00:50:58,255 --> 00:51:00,553
A license?

765
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:03,353
Wait a minute. All right.
Just-Just hold. Wait a minute.

766
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:08,157
Damn it to hell.

767
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,734
Why'd he-

768
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:17,232
Burt...

769
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,467
it expired in 1958.

770
00:51:21,144 --> 00:51:23,977
I can get-
Don't you shout at me like that, Burt!

771
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:27,582
I can get it renewed.

772
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:30,380
Tomorrow. Yes.

773
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:33,683
Yep.

774
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,690
Well, give my love to them.

775
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:37,692
Would you calm down?

776
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,829
Yeah.

777
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,298
Yes, I'll call you
when I get to Chicago.

778
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,301
Right.

779
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,303
Okay, son.

780
00:51:48,405 --> 00:51:50,965
Don't worry. Bye-bye.

781
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,510
[Sighs]

782
00:52:15,265 --> 00:52:18,530
You know, Tonto,
when I was very young...

783
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,195
I thought about
driving cross-country.

784
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:24,506
Never made it though.

785
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:26,508
Met Annie, and that was that.

786
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,805
Kids, family, work.

787
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:32,947
It wasn't Annie's fault though.

788
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,586
No, we had good times.

789
00:52:38,588 --> 00:52:40,488
But, you know, maybe-

790
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,589
maybe I thought
there just wasn't enough...

791
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,527
time, or enough money.

792
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,064
And on the other hand,
there really was.

793
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:56,037
We had good times though.

794
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,039
Good times.

795
00:52:59,476 --> 00:53:02,912
Lake Saranac, Cape Cod-

796
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,913
beautiful summers.

797
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:08,583
Annie loved to swim.

798
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,483
Much better swimmer than I was.

799
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:13,488
Powerful strokes.

800
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,551
People used to wonder
how that little body...

801
00:53:17,661 --> 00:53:20,027
could churn through
the water that way.

802
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,533
Wonderful.

803
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,860
I'll let you in on something, Tonto.

804
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,298
I have a great fear of pain.

805
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:37,673
I would rather go... like that...

806
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,681
than suffer for a long time.

807
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:44,852
Oh, how Annie suffered.

808
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:48,118
The suffering was worse
than the dying.

809
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:51,820
- I dreaded seeing her in the morning.
- [Siren Chirps]

810
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,192
She never complained.

811
00:53:55,632 --> 00:53:58,362
Never complained.

812
00:53:58,468 --> 00:54:00,368
That was my specialty.

813
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:06,804
Hell, you know, you never
really feel somebody's suffering.

814
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,513
You only feel their death.

815
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,748
Just act normal, kiddo.

816
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:22,051
Just act normal.

817
00:54:38,575 --> 00:54:40,975
- [Harry] You have a driver's license?
- Yes, sir.

818
00:54:41,077 --> 00:54:43,978
- Hop in. Take over the wheel.
- Ah, Jesus loves you.

819
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:45,809
Hallelujah.

820
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,885

"James, the son of Alphaeus...

833
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,383
Yeah, all right. All right.

834
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,052
- [Meows]
- Oh, sure. I know.

835
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,062
Yeah.

836
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,065
See, these people are heading south
towards Atlanta...

837
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:39,067
so I'll be on my way.

838
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,069
What about Chicago?

839
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,139
Thank you, Mr. Combes.

840
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:46,475
Bye-bye, Ginger.

841
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:53,414
Aren't you going with him?

842
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,542
- No.
- Have an argument?

843
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:59,622
We only met the lift before yours.

844
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:04,053
Is this the Pepsi Generation?

845
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:20,540
[French Accent]
# Every little bird seems to whisper Louise #

846
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:24,010
# Birds in the trees
seem to whisper Louise #

847
00:56:24,114 --> 00:56:26,548
- [Chuckles]
- Maurice Chevalier!

848
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,517
How'd you know that one?

849
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,587
I saw him on TV.

850
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,656
Ginger, can I get personal?

851
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:37,124
Sure. But no lectures.

852
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,127
You running away from home?

853
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:41,129
Yeah.

854
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,290
You know where you're going?

855
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,131
A girl I know gave me the address
of a commune in Boulder, Colorado.

856
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,638
Do you know what it's like
in those communes?

857
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,675
Drugs, sex, orgies.

858
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,575
Yeah, well, I don't know about that.

859
00:56:56,679 --> 00:56:58,340
What about your parents?

860
00:56:58,448 --> 00:57:00,643
Oh, they're okay.

861
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,581
What about school?

862
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,585
I had enough.

863
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:06,621
Ginger, how old are you?

864
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:08,782
Sixteen.

865
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:11,793
- Sixteen.
- Yeah.

866
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:15,626
Well, I guess I don't know what
it's like to be 16 these days.

867
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:17,757
Neither do I.

868
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,802
When I was going to college...

869
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,044
I worked as a singing waiter...

870
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,046
in Feltman's.

871
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:34,048
[Chuckles]
Coney Island.

872
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:36,050
I had a good voice.

873
00:57:36,152 --> 00:57:38,552
[Ginger]
You still do.

874
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:42,785
Matter of fact, I was thinking about
going into show business.

875
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,387
But I finally realized that...

876
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,397
education needed me more than...

877
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,467
entertainment.

878
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,896
I needed the security of a job...

879
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,303
more than the thrill of performing.

880
00:58:00,844 --> 00:58:04,245
Performing has a lot to
do with being a good teacher, you know.

881
00:58:06,282 --> 00:58:10,013
A teacher has to be on,
you know, sense his audience.

882
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:13,255
I was a good teacher.

883
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,215
Does this bother you?

884
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:19,522
Uh, yes, I, uh-

885
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:21,529
I'm embarrassed.

886
00:58:21,631 --> 00:58:23,690
I'm sorry.

887
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,768
I'm dressed now.

888
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:28,770
Guess I'm a...

889
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:31,773
little too old
to readjust my thinking.

890
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,775
Now you sound like my mother.

891
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:35,777
You're just likeJessie.

892
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,109
Yeah? Who's Jessie?

893
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:42,173
Jessie was the first woman
I ever saw naked.

894
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:45,754
Crazy, wondrous Jessie.

895
00:58:47,056 --> 00:58:49,024
I wanted to marry her.

896
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:54,028
- You see, I slept with her.
- Did you like her?

897
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:56,030
Like her?

898
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:58,032
I loved her.

899
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,034
She didn't want to marry me.

900
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:02,104
She didn't believe in marriage.

901
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:04,867
Neither do I.

902
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:09,308
She was a liberated woman
long before it became fashionable.

903
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:13,707
Not just sexually liberated.

904
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,909
In every way.

905
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,919
She danced with Isadora.

906
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,921
Isadora Duncan.

907
00:59:20,023 --> 00:59:22,924
I saw the movie
with Vanessa Redgrave.

908
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:26,427
I went with Jessie for two months.

909
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,963
And then she...

910
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,590
took off for Paris with Isadora.

911
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:33,669
Then I met Annie.

912
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:37,805
And here I am.

913
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,636
Are you sorry?

914
00:59:40,677 --> 00:59:42,577
No.

915
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:45,079
I've had a wonderful life.

916
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,649
I hope you don't mind taking tea.

917
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,585
[Grunts]

918
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:54,350
You know, it's too bad you couldn't
have lived with Jessie and Annie.

919
00:59:54,457 --> 00:59:56,357
[Chuckles]

920
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:59,860
Maybe that's why
I didn't go into show business.

921
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:01,863
You ever hear from Jessie?

922
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:04,365
Matter of fact, I did.

923
01:00:04,467 --> 01:00:06,367
After Isadora died-

924
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:10,530
- Her scarf got caught in the car wheel.
- I know, I know.

925
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,541
She came back to the States
and she got married.

926
01:00:13,643 --> 01:00:16,203
Became a housewife.

927
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,212
Married a druggist...

928
01:00:18,314 --> 01:00:20,214
from Fort Wayne, Indiana.

929
01:00:20,316 --> 01:00:22,181
His name was Stone.

930
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:26,652
You really got it on with Jessie.

931
01:00:26,756 --> 01:00:28,621
She was a lovely person.

932
01:00:28,725 --> 01:00:30,454
Is she dead?

933
01:00:31,728 --> 01:00:33,628
I don't know.

934
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,731
Let's go see her.

935
01:00:36,833 --> 01:00:38,733
What?

936
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,962
Let's go see how she is.

937
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,005
She may have passed on.

938
01:00:44,107 --> 01:00:46,075
Well, let's find out.

939
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,671
It's far out of our way.

940
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,372
So what?

941
01:02:09,321 --> 01:02:11,755
[Doorbell Rings]

942
01:02:15,961 --> 01:02:18,156
Yes, sir?

943
01:02:18,264 --> 01:02:20,164
Uh, I'm Harry Combes.

944
01:02:20,266 --> 01:02:22,791
I'm looking forJessie Stone.

945
01:02:22,902 --> 01:02:24,870
What for?

946
01:02:26,405 --> 01:02:29,806
- [Footsteps]
- Uh, I think we've come to the wrong place.

947
01:02:29,909 --> 01:02:32,605
- Can I help you?
- They're looking for Grandma.

948
01:02:32,712 --> 01:02:34,612
No, no. It's a mistake.

949
01:02:34,714 --> 01:02:37,615
- I'm looking for a Jessie Stone.
- Well, this is the place.

950
01:02:37,717 --> 01:02:40,811
But my wife ain't home just yet.

951
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,820
Oh. Oh, I see.

952
01:02:42,922 --> 01:02:46,824
- What are you looking forJessie for?
- They used to be sweethearts.

953
01:02:46,926 --> 01:02:49,827
- Amazing! [Laughing]
- [Laughing]

954
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:51,829
It was a long time ago.

- You better believe it!
- [Laughing Continues]

956
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,859
Hey, Jessie! Guess what!

957
01:02:56,969 --> 01:02:58,994
Your boyfriend's come a-calling.!

958
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:02,970
Let me tell you straight off.

959
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:05,976
Thursday is the only day I have open...

960
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:08,638
and that's about all spoken for.

961
01:03:08,748 --> 01:03:11,148
[Sighs]
My feet are killin' me.

962
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:14,981
Uh, I thought you were anotherJessie Stone.
Please excuse the intrusion.

963
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,988
Well, you got the right name,
but the wrong party.

964
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,990
Now, you mean theJessie Stone...

965
01:03:20,092 --> 01:03:23,084
that used to have the dancing school
on State Street.

966
01:03:23,195 --> 01:03:25,095
Yes.

967
01:03:25,197 --> 01:03:27,563
I used to get her gas bills by mistake.

968
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:29,634
She was a funny lady.

969
01:03:30,836 --> 01:03:32,770
Is she still alive?

970
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:36,205
I think she's in an old age home
on Wharton Street.

971
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:40,101
Well, thank you, Jessie.
Very nice to have met you.

01:03:40,212 --> 01:03:42,612

- It's quite all right.
- Bye-bye.

- Bye. [Groans]
- Come on in.

- Good morning.

Oh, I'm sorry.
No pets allowed.

977
01:04:25,057 --> 01:04:27,958
- Would you put Tonto back in the car, Ginger?
- Yeah.

978
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,460
- Uh, I want to-
- Can I see your papers, please?

979
01:04:30,563 --> 01:04:32,963
- I'm just visiting.
- Who did you want to see?

980
01:04:33,065 --> 01:04:36,466
- Jessie Stone.
- Oh. She hasn't had any visitors in a long time.

981
01:04:36,569 --> 01:04:39,697
- You know her well?
- Well, I haven't seen her in 50 years.

982
01:04:39,805 --> 01:04:42,365
Well, she may not remember you.

983
01:04:42,474 --> 01:04:45,375
- Come this way. I'll take you.
- Thank you.

984
01:04:45,477 --> 01:04:47,707
It's right this way.

985
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:53,083
- Sometimes she seems a bit confused.
- Mm-hmm.

986
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:56,086
Good morning, Thomas.
Well, here we are.

987
01:04:56,188 --> 01:04:59,089
- This is our arts and crafts room.
- Very nice.

- When the hell are you
going to get me another book?
- Soon. Soon.

01:05:20,546 --> 01:05:22,446
- I brought you a visitor.
- Oh?

I thought maybe you'd forgotten.

1008

- I was on my way to Chicago to visit my daughter.
- How's Annie?

- Yes, Jessie?
- I have nothing to read.

1041
01:09:47,980 --> 01:09:50,881
- What are you doing here?
- Dad sent me to bring you back home.

1042
01:09:50,983 --> 01:09:53,884
Why? I'm fine.
I'm having a wonderful time.

1043
01:09:53,986 --> 01:09:55,886
- Norman, this is Ginger.
- Hi.

1044
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:58,422
- Hi.
- Ginger's my traveling companion.

1045
01:09:58,524 --> 01:10:00,924
Harry gave me a lift.

1046
01:10:01,026 --> 01:10:02,926
You're looking fine, Grandpa.

1047
01:10:03,028 --> 01:10:05,861
- You're talking.
- Yeah. Garbo speaks.

1048
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:09,456
- Norman was silent for several weeks.
- [Footsteps]

1049
01:10:09,568 --> 01:10:12,765
Well, Tonto, I see you brought
my old man, huh?

1050
01:10:13,872 --> 01:10:15,533
You're looking good, Shirley.

1051
01:10:15,641 --> 01:10:18,132
You look pretty good too.

1052
01:10:19,244 --> 01:10:20,836
I love this place.

1053
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:24,949
Well, I'm glad you finally got to see it.

1054
01:10:27,519 --> 01:10:29,487
Hardly recognized Norman.

1055
01:10:30,622 --> 01:10:33,090
[Speaking Latin]

1056
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:37,720
The times change,
and we change with it.

1057
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:40,354
Not so much, though.

1058
01:10:40,465 --> 01:10:43,400
- Shirley, this is Ginger. She's with me.
- Hi.

1059
01:10:43,502 --> 01:10:46,403
- On what basis?
- Well, we met on the road.

1060
01:10:46,505 --> 01:10:49,406
We had a short
but passionate love affair.

1061
01:10:49,508 --> 01:10:51,408
What do you mean?

1062
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:54,741
- She ran away from home.
- Oh. How old are you?

1063
01:10:54,846 --> 01:10:57,246
Don't worry about it.
I'm leaving in the morning.

1064
01:10:57,349 --> 01:10:59,146
Where to?

1065
01:10:59,251 --> 01:11:02,243
Boulder, Colorado.
Or maybe Bangladesh.

1066
01:11:02,354 --> 01:11:04,322
Actually, it depends on the lift.

1067
01:11:04,423 --> 01:11:07,324
What the hell are you gonna do
in Boulder, Colorado?

1068
01:11:07,426 --> 01:11:10,327
Shirley, I'd like to take a nice, hot bath.

1069
01:11:10,429 --> 01:11:14,092
I'm sorry. Of course. I live right in the back,
up there, up the stairs.

1070
01:11:14,199 --> 01:11:17,100
Billie, I'll be back in an hour. Okay?

1071
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:20,603
- So, tell me, was it that bad at home?
- No.

1072
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:23,174
How old are you? Ten?

1073
01:11:23,275 --> 01:11:25,175
I'm 15.

1074
01:11:25,277 --> 01:11:27,177
- Uh-huh.
- Fifteen?

1075
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:29,406
You told me you were 16.

1076
01:11:29,514 --> 01:11:32,210
Oh, yeah. I'm 16.

1077
01:11:33,685 --> 01:11:37,177
Terrific. You know you're gonna
get murdered in Boulder.

1078
01:11:37,289 --> 01:11:39,189
It's a commune where she's going.

1079
01:11:39,291 --> 01:11:42,852
- Harry, what the hell
do you know about communes?
- Don't shout at me, Shirley.

1080
01:11:42,961 --> 01:11:45,555
Well- [Stammers]
She'll be knocked up in a week.

1081
01:11:45,664 --> 01:11:47,564
Ginger is not a loose girl.

1082
01:11:47,666 --> 01:11:50,567
Yeah, but she'll be living
with a lot of loose men. Come on.

1083
01:11:50,669 --> 01:11:53,570
With your record with men,
I wouldn't presume to give advice.

1084
01:11:53,672 --> 01:11:56,505
- You've had three bad marriages.
- Four.

1085
01:11:59,177 --> 01:12:02,237
- What happened to Chico?
- Ah, I threw him out.

1086
01:12:02,347 --> 01:12:04,247
It's upstairs.

1087
01:12:04,349 --> 01:12:06,249
You'll never have kids.

1088
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:10,279
Oh, I don't know.

1089
01:12:10,389 --> 01:12:12,380
"I loved her most...

1090
01:12:12,491 --> 01:12:16,825
thought to set my rest
on her kind nursery."

1091
01:12:16,928 --> 01:12:19,192
Please, Harry. No Shakespeare, huh?

1092
01:12:20,265 --> 01:12:22,825
What's the matter with Shakespeare?

1093
01:12:22,934 --> 01:12:24,834
Probably the world's greatest writer.

1094
01:12:24,936 --> 01:12:26,836
I know. I agree.

1095
01:12:26,938 --> 01:12:29,338
- I'm tired.
- I know.

1096
01:12:29,441 --> 01:12:31,341
Listen, why don't you hang around?

1097
01:12:31,443 --> 01:12:34,344
I could help you,
get you some counseling or something.

1098
01:12:34,446 --> 01:12:37,347
Oh, no, thanks.
I've had three years of it already.

1099
01:12:37,449 --> 01:12:40,350
Why don't I get us
some fried chicken?

1100
01:12:40,452 --> 01:12:42,352
- You're eating too.
- I'll go with you.

1101
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:44,854
Okay. I like you, Norman.

1102
01:12:44,956 --> 01:12:46,856
I like you too, Aunt Shirley.

1103
01:12:46,958 --> 01:12:48,926
But I think you're a bitch.

1104
01:12:50,962 --> 01:12:53,863
What do you think, Tonto? Hmm?

1105
01:12:53,965 --> 01:12:56,365
Here we go. Up you go.

1106
01:12:56,468 --> 01:12:59,437
- [Meowing]
- You okay?

1107
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:06,776
What do you mean, what am I gonna do?
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

1108
01:13:06,878 --> 01:13:09,847
- I have no schedule.
- Well, you can't just drift.

1109
01:13:11,550 --> 01:13:13,950
You know, it's colder here
than in New York.

1110
01:13:14,052 --> 01:13:15,952
You're an intelligent man, Harry.

1111
01:13:16,054 --> 01:13:18,955
- You shouldn't waste yourself.
- What can I do?

1112
01:13:19,057 --> 01:13:21,457
- Teach! What do you think?
- I'm too old.

1113
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,460
Oh, bullshit. Come on now.

1114
01:13:23,562 --> 01:13:26,963
You know that there are
free schools opening all over this city.

1115
01:13:27,065 --> 01:13:29,966
If you wanna stay here,
I can help you get a job.

1116
01:13:30,068 --> 01:13:32,969
I mean it. They're looking
for really good teachers.

1117
01:13:33,071 --> 01:13:34,971
How about it?

1118
01:13:35,073 --> 01:13:36,973
Is that me?

1119
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:38,975
Yeah, that's right. That's you.

1120
01:13:39,077 --> 01:13:41,045
Poor old thing.

1121
01:13:42,114 --> 01:13:43,945
- Shirley?
- What?

1122
01:13:44,049 --> 01:13:46,017
Do you love me?

1123
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:51,121
I'll tell you something, Harry-
I don't always like you.

1124
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:53,953
But l- I do love you.

1125
01:13:56,628 --> 01:13:59,529
Then why do we always argue?

1126
01:13:59,631 --> 01:14:03,658
I don't know. I guess that's the way
we talk to each other, Harry.

1127
01:14:06,338 --> 01:14:09,307
I think I remember
the past too much.

1128
01:14:10,675 --> 01:14:14,509
The strangest thing
about being old is...

1129
01:14:14,613 --> 01:14:17,013
all your friends are dead.

1130
01:14:17,115 --> 01:14:19,015
Well, all your old friends, maybe.

1131
01:14:19,117 --> 01:14:21,176
You could make new friends.

1132
01:14:21,286 --> 01:14:23,254
That's an idea.

1133
01:14:24,656 --> 01:14:26,556
How do you do?

1134
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:29,855
- Harry Combes here.
- Oh! Shirley Mallard. Glad to meet you.

1135
01:14:29,961 --> 01:14:31,861
- Shirley Mallard?
- Yes.

1136
01:14:31,963 --> 01:14:33,863
- One "L" or two?
- Two.

1137
01:14:33,965 --> 01:14:35,865
- Mallard. Oh, as in Wild Duck.
- Mmm!

1138
01:14:35,967 --> 01:14:37,867
- Remember The Wild Duck?
- Of course. Ibsen.

1139
01:14:37,969 --> 01:14:40,369
Yeah. Now, there
was a great playwright.

1140
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:42,372
He really understood women.

1141
01:14:42,474 --> 01:14:47,309
Some Swedish men actually stay home
and help take care of their children.

1142
01:14:47,412 --> 01:14:49,312
- Is that a fact?
- Mm-hmm.

1143
01:14:49,414 --> 01:14:51,882
Did you know that Ibsen was Norwegian?

1144
01:14:54,052 --> 01:14:55,952
I wasn't talking about Ibsen.

1145
01:14:56,054 --> 01:14:58,921
Did you know that Ibsen loved to travel
and never stayed at home?

1146
01:14:59,024 --> 01:15:00,924
Oh, shut up.

1147
01:15:01,026 --> 01:15:03,392
You're a card, Harry, you are.

1148
01:15:03,495 --> 01:15:06,464
That's what people
keep telling me all the time.

1149
01:15:10,035 --> 01:15:12,435
You think we'll ever stop arguing?

1150
01:15:14,039 --> 01:15:15,939
Never.

1151
01:15:16,041 --> 01:15:18,009
Not a chance.

1152
01:15:21,546 --> 01:15:23,946
Well, at least we agree on something.

1153
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:26,347
Come on, pal. I'll buy you a drink.

1154
01:16:25,911 --> 01:16:27,811

[Harry]
Will you hold on just a minute?

1158
01:17:51,062 --> 01:17:52,962
No, Norman is with me.

1159
01:17:53,064 --> 01:17:55,464
He decided to come along with us.

1160
01:17:55,567 --> 01:17:57,535
I'll put him on the phone.

1161

1162
01:18:01,873 --> 01:18:05,775
Hello, Dad? No, for real! Arizona!

1163
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:09,574
Yeah, but then I'm gonna go on
to Boulder, Colorado.

1164
01:18:09,681 --> 01:18:11,649
Hi, Mom. How are you-

1165
01:18:12,684 --> 01:18:15,084
Look, l-I feel good, Ma.

1166
01:18:15,186 --> 01:18:17,746
I wanna try living on this commu-

1167
01:18:17,856 --> 01:18:19,824
Please don't.

1168
01:18:20,959 --> 01:18:22,859
Hi, Dad.

1169
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:26,397
I'm not doing anything to hurt anybody.!

1170
01:18:26,498 --> 01:18:29,331
[Stammers]
I feel good. I feel fine.

1171
01:18:30,368 --> 01:18:32,268
No, no, not alone.

1172
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:34,338
With a girl named Ginger.

1173
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,540
She's 18.

1174
01:18:37,642 --> 01:18:39,542
Yeah, ju-just a-just a second.

1175
01:18:39,644 --> 01:18:42,272
I want you to meet my father. Here.

1176
01:18:45,450 --> 01:18:48,908
Hi. Uh, Mr. Combes? Yeah.

1177
01:18:49,020 --> 01:18:54,287
I just wanted to say that you've a beautiful son,
and a beautiful father too.

1178
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,260
All right. Hang on.

1179
01:18:57,362 --> 01:18:59,830
Harry, he wants to talk to you.

1180
01:19:01,800 --> 01:19:03,791
Hello?
[Clears Throat]

1181
01:19:03,902 --> 01:19:05,870
It's me again. Yeah.

1182
01:19:06,938 --> 01:19:09,839
Listen, uh- Listen carefully, pl-

1183
01:19:09,941 --> 01:19:14,844
Burt, would you please send my checks
on to Eddie in Los Angeles?

1184
01:19:14,946 --> 01:19:17,380
Y- Eddie. Your brother.

1185
01:19:17,482 --> 01:19:19,712
I'll be staying on with him.

1186
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:22,116
What would I do in a commune?

1187
01:19:23,188 --> 01:19:25,247
L- I know. Life is confusing.

1188
01:19:25,356 --> 01:19:28,257
We're just trying to
get on with it, that's all.

1189
01:19:28,359 --> 01:19:30,919
Just a minute. Operator?

1190
01:19:31,029 --> 01:19:32,997
You want more change?

1191
01:19:34,199 --> 01:19:35,598
Just a minute.

1192
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,168
Norman, do you have any change?

1193
01:19:39,370 --> 01:19:41,338
Hold it.

1194
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:45,007
We're trying to get the change, operator.

1195
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:47,237
Burt, I'll talk quickly now.

1196
01:19:47,345 --> 01:19:50,872
Elaine! Would you stop crying.

1197
01:19:50,982 --> 01:19:53,212
Operator?

1198
01:19:53,318 --> 01:19:55,809
That was a very wrong thing to do.

1199
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:58,889
We were just about ready
to put in some-

1200
01:20:09,501 --> 01:20:13,062
Norman, I want you
to write to your parents every day.

1201
01:20:13,171 --> 01:20:16,572
- Call 'em too.
- Mom'll just cry if I call.

1202
01:20:16,674 --> 01:20:18,574
Do you promise me?

1203
01:20:18,676 --> 01:20:20,576
Okay.

1204
01:20:20,678 --> 01:20:22,578
Harry, come with us.

1205
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,580
Maybe I'll visit you.

1206
01:20:24,682 --> 01:20:28,209
Grandpa, I feel real weird
about leaving you here.

1207
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:30,219
Norman...

1208

Why, I sold me a rex once that
weighed upwards of 30 pounds.

1234

Cats are smarter than we are.

I want you to get plenty of"C" too.

"C" goes good with "E."

1251

Back up your "E" with "C"
and you'll be dancin' till midnight.

1252

No limit to "C."

01:42:17,727 --> 01:42:20,628
- Tonto is thirsty.
- Huh? Oh! Right. Right.

1551
01:42:20,730 --> 01:42:23,130
Let's get a little water for Tonto.

1552
01:42:23,233 --> 01:42:25,531
- Yeah. Got a bowl right here.
- [Water Running]

1553
01:42:25,635 --> 01:42:27,535
[Chuckling]

1554
01:42:27,637 --> 01:42:29,537
Eddie, my check arrive yet?

1555
01:42:29,639 --> 01:42:31,539
Oh, yeah. Yup.

1556
01:42:31,641 --> 01:42:33,541
Over there on the table, Pop.

1557
01:42:33,643 --> 01:42:36,942
[Chuckling]
Yeah, look at old Tonto.

1558
01:42:51,094 --> 01:42:54,495
Uh, I figured we could
stay in this place at first, Pop.

1559
01:42:54,598 --> 01:42:56,498
The couches, they pull out.

1560
01:42:56,600 --> 01:42:59,501
And then, if it gets too crowded,
we could get a one-bedroom.

1561
01:42:59,603 --> 01:43:01,434
That goes for two and a half.

1562
01:43:01,538 --> 01:43:04,439
But there's no sense in rushing things.

1563
01:43:04,541 --> 01:43:06,941
I'm too old for this place, Eddie.

1564
01:43:07,043 --> 01:43:08,943
Oh, come on, Pop.

1565
01:43:09,045 --> 01:43:12,776
Lfigured we could split the rent.
That comes to one and a quarter each.

1566
01:43:12,883 --> 01:43:15,283
You broke, Eddie?

1567
01:43:15,385 --> 01:43:18,286
I'm a little low.
Yeah, Pop, I'm a little low right now.

1568
01:43:18,388 --> 01:43:20,788
- That's no good.
- Aw, come on, Pop.

1569
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:24,793
No, Eddie, I have to find
a place of my own. Please, Eddie.

1570
01:43:24,895 --> 01:43:27,796
I wouldn't make it here
for two weeks.

1571
01:43:27,898 --> 01:43:29,957
I don't know where I'll go.

1572
01:43:30,066 --> 01:43:33,035
Maybe I'll go up
and see the kids in Colorado.

1573
01:43:34,371 --> 01:43:36,339
[Sighs]

1574
01:43:38,808 --> 01:43:40,776
Pop, I'm on my ass.

1575
01:43:42,112 --> 01:43:44,012
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1576
01:43:44,114 --> 01:43:47,515
I'll call Burt up and have him take
a thousand out of my account.

1577
01:43:47,617 --> 01:43:50,586
- Wouldn't want Burt to know.
- Oh, what the hell is the difference?

1578
01:43:52,522 --> 01:43:54,422
All right, Burt won't know.

1579
01:43:54,524 --> 01:43:56,492
I'll tell him it's for me.

1580
01:44:13,476 --> 01:44:15,603
Have a nice view here, Eddie.

1581
01:44:17,447 --> 01:44:19,415
Maybe too nice.

1582
01:44:22,652 --> 01:44:24,620
Why don't you call Ellen?

1583
01:44:26,122 --> 01:44:29,091
Oh, that's over, Pop. That's all over.

1584
01:44:31,127 --> 01:44:33,527
Stay with me, huh?

1585
01:44:33,630 --> 01:44:36,064
Eddie, what are you afraid of?

1586
01:44:37,701 --> 01:44:41,102
I'm scared when I go out on a job.

1587
01:44:41,204 --> 01:44:44,503
I'm afraid I'll blow it
before I've even started.

1588
01:44:49,512 --> 01:44:52,675
Eddie, would you make mine
a mild scotch and water?

1589
01:44:55,452 --> 01:44:57,682
With a twist.

1590
01:44:57,787 --> 01:45:00,347
- You remember.
- Yeah.

1591
01:45:02,659 --> 01:45:04,559
Hey...

1592
01:45:04,661 --> 01:45:08,062
maybe we could get a place
out on the Strip.

1593
01:45:08,164 --> 01:45:12,066
Eddie, I'd be glad
to help you with money.

1594
01:45:12,168 --> 01:45:14,136
[Chuckles]

1595
01:45:18,675 --> 01:45:21,235
Where you gonna go?

1596
01:45:21,344 --> 01:45:23,744
Oh, I don't know.

1597
01:45:23,847 --> 01:45:26,748
I'm not going back to New York.

1598
01:45:26,850 --> 01:45:28,977
That's not good for me anymore.

1599
01:45:32,455 --> 01:45:34,423
No.

1600
01:45:36,726 --> 01:45:38,887
[Sobbing]

1601
01:45:40,363 --> 01:45:42,923
Come on. Come on, come on.

1602
01:45:43,033 --> 01:45:45,433
Eddie, come on.

1603
01:45:45,535 --> 01:45:48,095
You'll get back on your feet.

1604
01:45:48,204 --> 01:45:51,765
- I'm sorry, Pop.
- It's all right. It's all right.

1605
01:45:51,875 --> 01:45:54,002
- Tell you what.
- [Sobbing Continues]

1606
01:45:55,745 --> 01:45:57,645
I'll help you find a place...

1607
01:45:57,747 --> 01:46:00,580
you help me find a place.

1608
01:46:00,684 --> 01:46:02,584
You know a good broker?

1609
01:46:02,686 --> 01:46:04,654
I'm a broker.

1610
01:46:07,657 --> 01:46:11,423
Listen, I just don't think
we should live together.

1611
01:46:11,528 --> 01:46:14,588
I want to see you
make a life for yourself-

1612
01:46:14,698 --> 01:46:19,658
work, wife, kids.

1613
01:46:21,037 --> 01:46:22,937
Yeah.

1614
01:46:23,039 --> 01:46:25,007
[Patting Back]

1615
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:32,848
[Chuckles]

1616
01:46:58,408 --> 01:47:00,308
- Good morning, Harry.
- Morning, Anatol.

1617
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:02,241
- Good morning.
- Morning, Anatol.

1618
01:47:02,345 --> 01:47:06,577
L-I don't accept any of that
"life is a river, life is a fountain" routine.

1619
01:47:06,683 --> 01:47:09,584
Perhaps philosophically it makes sense.

1620
01:47:09,686 --> 01:47:13,588
But man has to struggle,
or he'll drown in the river.

1621
01:47:13,690 --> 01:47:16,591
You won't drown
if you flow with the river.

1622
01:47:16,693 --> 01:47:18,593
It's your move.

1623
01:47:18,695 --> 01:47:21,596
Maybe a yogi won't drown.
What about the man in Cleveland, Ohio?

1624
01:47:21,698 --> 01:47:23,598
Or Santa Monica, California?

1625
01:47:23,700 --> 01:47:26,260
It's all the same.

1626
01:47:26,369 --> 01:47:28,269
I have a son in Cleveland.

1627
01:47:28,371 --> 01:47:30,271
It's not all the same.

1628
01:47:30,373 --> 01:47:33,274
If it were all the same,
nothing would be different.

1629
01:47:33,376 --> 01:47:35,276
Nothing is different.

1630
01:47:35,378 --> 01:47:37,278
Am I different than you are?

1631
01:47:37,380 --> 01:47:41,783
Only your appearance.
Underneath, we're all the same.

1632
01:47:41,885 --> 01:47:44,877
- Bullshit.
- [Chuckling]

1633
01:47:44,988 --> 01:47:49,254
[Laughing] Harry, I know you breathe air,
and that I breathe air.

1634
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:52,260
It's the same air, no matter who you are.

1635
01:47:52,362 --> 01:47:54,262
A-Are you saying...

1636
01:47:54,364 --> 01:47:56,264
that the air here...

1637
01:47:56,366 --> 01:47:58,891
is the same as the air in town?

1638
01:47:59,002 --> 01:48:02,267
[Laughing]
That's crazy!

1639
01:48:02,372 --> 01:48:06,468
You drive to town,
you can't even see, it's so black.

1640
01:48:06,576 --> 01:48:10,603
- Anatol, he's talking about philosophical air.
- Oh.

1641
01:48:10,713 --> 01:48:13,477
- No, I'm not.
- Check.

1642
01:48:14,617 --> 01:48:17,984
Air... is air, for everybody.

1643
01:48:18,087 --> 01:48:19,987
What about animals?

1644
01:48:20,089 --> 01:48:22,387
Animals can't reason.

1645
01:48:22,492 --> 01:48:24,551
You don't know Tonto.

1646
01:48:24,661 --> 01:48:26,891
- [Grunts]
- Hmm.

1647
01:48:26,996 --> 01:48:30,090
Tonto doesn't look so good.

1648
01:48:30,200 --> 01:48:32,100
[Meows]

1649
01:48:32,202 --> 01:48:34,170
Take care of my set.

1650
01:48:37,707 --> 01:48:39,834
What's the matter with Tonto?

1651
01:48:44,714 --> 01:48:47,740
#Roamin'in the gloamin'#

1652
01:48:49,052 --> 01:48:52,954
# On the bonny banks o' Clyde #

1653
01:48:53,056 --> 01:48:55,957
# Roamin' in the gloamin' #

1654
01:48:56,059 --> 01:48:59,187
#With my lassie by my side #

1655
01:48:59,295 --> 01:49:02,992
#When the sun goes down to rest #

1656
01:49:03,099 --> 01:49:06,068
#That's the time that we love best #

1657
01:49:07,437 --> 01:49:09,268
# Oh, it's lovely #

1658
01:49:09,372 --> 01:49:12,000
# Roamin' in #

1659
01:49:12,108 --> 01:49:15,077
#The gloamin' ##

1660
01:49:17,847 --> 01:49:20,407
Who was that, Tonto?

1661
01:49:20,517 --> 01:49:22,576
Right.

1662
01:49:22,685 --> 01:49:24,653
Sir Harry Lauder.

1663
01:49:28,992 --> 01:49:30,960
So long, kiddo.

1664
01:50:24,280 --> 01:50:26,180
[Harry]
"Dear Leroy...

1665
01:50:26,282 --> 01:50:28,512
"Hope you are well.

1666
01:50:28,618 --> 01:50:31,109
"Tonto passed away.

1667
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,120
"He was 11 years old...

1668
01:50:33,222 --> 01:50:36,419
"which made him 77 by our count.

1669
01:50:36,526 --> 01:50:38,551
"He had a good life.

1670
01:50:38,661 --> 01:50:41,562
"If you haven't found a job yet...

1671
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:44,064
"you oughta think
about coming out here.

1672
01:50:44,167 --> 01:50:47,068
- "I'm living at the beach.
- Come on!

1673
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:49,695
- "No smog, lots of sunshine.
- Come on.

1674
01:50:49,806 --> 01:50:52,104
"I haven't been mugged yet.

1675
01:50:52,208 --> 01:50:54,108
"I'm working three afternoons a week...

1676
01:50:54,210 --> 01:50:56,110
tutoring high school kids-"

1677
01:50:56,212 --> 01:50:59,113
- These are my children.
- I see.

1678
01:50:59,215 --> 01:51:02,582
They expect me every day,
rain or shine.

1679
01:51:02,685 --> 01:51:05,245
Oh-You live here?

1680
01:51:05,355 --> 01:51:07,255
Yes.

1681
01:51:07,357 --> 01:51:09,257
Oh, this used to be
some neighborhood.

1682
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:11,759
- Are you Jewish?
- [Chuckles] No.

1683
01:51:11,861 --> 01:51:13,954
I'm into Zen Buddhism these days.

1684
01:51:14,063 --> 01:51:17,555
I used to keep a kosher table,
but I'm not particular anymore.

1685
01:51:17,667 --> 01:51:20,192
- You got friends here?
- Yeah, a few.

1686
01:51:20,303 --> 01:51:22,703
I live alone. But isn't it silly?

1687
01:51:22,805 --> 01:51:26,798
I got two beautiful rooms overlooking
the water. Why should one go empty?

1688
01:51:26,909 --> 01:51:28,809
Why don't you rent it?

1689
01:51:28,911 --> 01:51:30,811
So move in with me.

1690
01:51:30,913 --> 01:51:33,814
[Laughs]
You know, that's an interesting proposition.

1691
01:51:33,916 --> 01:51:35,816
Two can live cheaper than one.

1692
01:51:35,918 --> 01:51:39,354
Between your check and mine,
we could be on easy street.

1693
01:51:39,455 --> 01:51:42,618
- [Laughs]
- I don't think I'm ready for marriage yet.

1694
01:51:42,725 --> 01:51:44,920
- Hey, mister, what's your name?
- Harry.

1695
01:51:45,028 --> 01:51:46,928
I'm Celia.

1696
01:51:47,030 --> 01:51:49,931
You wanna chase around
a little bit? It's okay.

1697
01:51:50,033 --> 01:51:53,127
Run around all you want.
I just want somebody to share the expenses.

1698
01:51:53,236 --> 01:51:56,137
That's a very generous offer.
I'm gonna think about it.

1699
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,264
It's ridiculous to cook for one person.

1700
01:51:58,374 --> 01:52:01,434
My best dishes
I don't make anymore 'cause I'm alone.

1701
01:52:02,545 --> 01:52:04,945
I eat a lot of canned food.

1702
01:52:05,048 --> 01:52:06,948
Oh! Canned food. It's a crime.

1703
01:52:07,050 --> 01:52:08,950
- Do you like boiled beef?
- Love it.

1704
01:52:09,052 --> 01:52:12,249
- But I think my favorite dish is Hungarian goulash.
- Oy!

1705
01:52:12,355 --> 01:52:14,255
I can't believe it.

1706
01:52:14,357 --> 01:52:17,758
If you hadn't told me, Harry,
I'd have thought you wereJewish.

1707
01:52:17,860 --> 01:52:20,260
[Both Laughing]

1708
01:52:20,363 --> 01:52:22,263
Hey! Stupid!

1709
01:52:22,365 --> 01:52:24,663
Come here and get your breakfast!

1710
01:53:01,537 --> 01:53:03,437
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1711
01:53:03,539 --> 01:53:06,007
Kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1712
01:53:06,109 --> 01:53:08,475
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1713
01:53:08,578 --> 01:53:10,739
All right, all right.

1714
01:53:10,847 --> 01:53:13,315
What's your name, kiddo? Huh?
