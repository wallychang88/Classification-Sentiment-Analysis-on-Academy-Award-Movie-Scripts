1
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:17,222
<i>Arturo, do we meet tonight?</i>

2
00:02:17,889 --> 00:02:19,849
<i>Tonight at the old hacienda.</i>

3
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:41,913
<i>- Good-bye.</i>
- Good-bye.

4
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,397
<i>Rosa!</i>

5
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,566
<i>Get away from that house!</i>

6
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,110
<i>Yes, Mama. I'm coming.</i>

7
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,160
<i>Don't bother those old sisters.
Just leave them alone.</i>

8
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:26,457
<i>The door was open.
I thought I might see them.</i>

9
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,918
<i>You only see them
when you don't expect it.</i>

10
00:03:29,002 --> 00:03:32,463
<i>Now help me. Your father
and brother will be home soon.</i>

11
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:48,813
<i>You see,
you're a smart man.</i>

12
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,859
You know that Arturo Xuncax
isn't your friend.

13
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,486
None of them are your friends.

14
00:03:56,946 --> 00:03:59,324
They don't respect old customs.

15
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,994
They'll just ruin you.

16
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:05,580
It's horrible.

17
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,042
Think of your family.

18
00:04:12,545 --> 00:04:17,216
Now let's stop wasting time.
Tell me where they're meeting.

19
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:28,895
<i>At the old hacienda — tonight.</i>

20
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,379
It's Don Goyo.
I love his music.

21
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:56,297
Come, sit down.

22
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,890
Are Pedro and Josefita coming?

23
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:08,142
Yes, they'll be here soon.

24
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,146
Arturo,

25
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:16,234
are you really going out tonight?

26
00:05:18,778 --> 00:05:20,405
Yes, probably.

27
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:17,378
That's it —
the old hacienda.

28
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,589
We'll go on foot from here.

29
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:22,133
Then we'll spread out.

30
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:32,894
In the U.S.,

31
00:06:32,977 --> 00:06:36,189
even the poorest people
have toilets...

32
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,983
just like Don Rodrigo's!

33
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,236
You flush it

34
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,364
and everything vanishes instantly!

35
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,409
You can really pee in style there!

36
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,414
It's always "the north" with you!
Can't you talk about anything else?

37
00:06:53,498 --> 00:06:56,375
I love hearing about the north.

38
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:58,419
Good.
<i>We hear about it enough!</i>

39
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:02,465
But it's true.
There's a lot of money there.

40
00:07:02,548 --> 00:07:08,054
I've heard from my friends —
all the people that have left.

41
00:07:08,137 --> 00:07:11,099
And you can see on TV
how it is up there.

42
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,559
That's right.

43
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:16,854
Even the poor people
have their own cars.

44
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,524
So, how do you know so much
about the north?

45
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:25,279
For ten years, Don Rodrigo's
cook has been giving me

46
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,406
all of her old <i>Good Housekeeping</i>
magazines.

47
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:33,162
Ten years I've been reading them.

48
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,873
I know plenty.

49
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,632
Excuse me.

50
00:07:44,966 --> 00:07:46,592
Go ahead.

51
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,227
Sweethearts?

52
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,354
Really?

53
00:07:58,437 --> 00:07:59,814
How romantic!

54
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:06,320
How are you, Rosita?

55
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,989
I'm fine, Luis.

56
00:08:08,072 --> 00:08:10,658
I brought you this cinnamon candy.

57
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:16,122
Oh, thank you.
I love it.

58
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:48,863
Well, excuse me,
but I'm going out for a while.

59
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,324
Stay and enjoy yourselves.

60
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,118
Stay here, please.

61
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,621
It's so late.

62
00:09:03,544 --> 00:09:05,463
I have to go.

63
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,020
Lupe.

64
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:25,524
Don't worry.
He can take care of himself.

65
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,488
Come on.
Sit down with us.

66
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:42,416
Good night, Rosita.

67
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,043
Good night.

68
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:02,520
Mama is afraid.

69
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:04,647
Do you have to go out tonight?

70
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:07,525
Your mother knows
how things are here.

71
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,736
She doesn't want trouble.

72
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,863
And that's fine, but...

73
00:10:13,823 --> 00:10:15,866
we can't go on
this way anymore.

74
00:10:16,617 --> 00:10:18,494
I'm afraid as well.

75
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:21,622
So am I.

76
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:28,004
But sometimes you have to
fight for your land.

77
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,047
There is no choice.

78
00:10:30,131 --> 00:10:33,384
The rich came here.
They're not from here.

79
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:36,178
They came looking for good land.

80
00:10:36,595 --> 00:10:40,391
No one fights over bad land.

81
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:43,102
That's why they took our land.

82
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:44,937
Because this is good land!

83
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:55,239
I'll tell you something, Enrique,

84
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:57,074
that my life has taught me.

85
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,620
I've worked in Mexico.

86
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,581
I've worked
on plantations at the coast.

87
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:05,624
I've worked in many places,

88
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,587
and everywhere it's the same.

89
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,549
For the rich,
the peasant is just a pair of arms.

90
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:17,011
That's all.
We are just arms to do their work.

91
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:21,599
They treat their animals
better than us.

92
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:28,522
For many years we've been trying
to make the rich understand

93
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:33,444
that the poor have hearts and souls.

94
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:37,948
That we feel.
That we are people, and we're all equal.

95
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,545
Let me go with you.

96
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:01,263
The time will come soon,

97
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,224
but not yet.

98
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:06,560
Go home.

99
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,855
Tell your mother not to worry.

100
00:12:10,231 --> 00:12:12,233
I'll be home soon.

101
00:12:59,155 --> 00:13:00,698
But where can we get guns?

102
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:03,451
We can run them through Chiapas,
just like other contraband.

103
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:05,619
The guerrillas
on the coast will help us.

104
00:13:05,703 --> 00:13:08,539
- Yes, he's right!
- No, wait —

105
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:26,849
<i>Protect him, Virgin Mother.</i>

106
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:36,150
Arturo's right.
It's impossible to be neutral anymore.

107
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:41,696
Run!

108
00:13:58,339 --> 00:13:59,673
Let's go.

109
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,950
That Indian bastard killed the Puma.

110
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:49,505
<i>It is not true</i>

111
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:55,594
<i>That we come here to live</i>

112
00:18:57,137 --> 00:19:01,892
<i>We come only to sleep, to dream</i>

113
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:07,272
<i>All things are lent to us</i>

114
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:09,566
<i>We are only on Earth in passing</i>

115
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:13,111
<i>Tomorrow or the next day</i>

116
00:19:15,239 --> 00:19:22,538
<i>As you desire, giver of life</i>

117
00:19:23,956 --> 00:19:27,125
<i>We shall go home to you</i>

118
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,890
<i>Mother!</i>

119
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,855
<i>Mother!</i>

120
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,359
<i>Mother!</i>

121
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,034
<i>Okay. Take this shit away.</i>

122
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:26,221
My mother.
Where's my mother?

123
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,311
We'll take care of you.
You'll stay here with us.

124
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:34,396
We'll protect you.

125
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:37,649
Forget about your mother.
The army's taken her away.

126
00:22:37,733 --> 00:22:41,862
No! My mother, no!
<i>It's not true!</i>

127
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:44,364
And Enrique!
- We don't know anything about him.

128
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:48,243
The soldiers are coming!
They're coming!

129
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:51,621
Quick! We've got to hide her!

130
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,129
They're leaving! Papa!
They're leaving!

131
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:05,218
Mama! Papa!
The soldiers are leaving!

132
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:30,303
I thought they had taken you.

133
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:33,223
I was hiding in the canyon.
They didn't see me.

134
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:38,520
I was so afraid.
I kept hearing the guns.

135
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:43,900
<i>Mother —</i>

136
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:49,322
They took her.

137
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:53,410
Yes, I know.

138
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:57,497
The soldiers will be back, Enrique.

139
00:24:59,374 --> 00:25:01,084
I'm afraid.

140
00:25:02,127 --> 00:25:05,088
People are leaving the village.

141
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:08,383
I have to leave too.

142
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:15,348
As long as I'm here,
I put all of you in danger.

143
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:18,977
You're going?

144
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,939
But where?

145
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:26,776
To the north.

146
00:25:32,908 --> 00:25:35,118
But I need money.

147
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:39,414
Ask our godmother.

148
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:42,375
See if she can help me.

149
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:47,505
Meet me tomorrow night
in our house.

150
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,595
Be careful.

151
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,132
Don Ramón!

152
00:26:37,347 --> 00:26:41,685
So you're still alive.
I'm amazed.

153
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,229
I hid in the canyon.

154
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:48,108
Okay, let's talk.

155
00:26:56,574 --> 00:27:00,161
You know a lot about what goes on.

156
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:01,830
I need help.

157
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:08,295
Right now your life
isn't worth five cents.

158
00:27:08,378 --> 00:27:10,130
They'll be back for you.

159
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:13,258
Today, tomorrow,

160
00:27:13,341 --> 00:27:14,676
the next day.

161
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,638
They'll hunt you down and find you.

162
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:23,018
You can't escape.
It's a fantasy.

163
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,563
Yes, I can.
I'm going to go north.

164
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,566
That's why I came here.

165
00:27:29,649 --> 00:27:33,194
You've been there before.
You can help me!

166
00:27:34,237 --> 00:27:36,781
It's a long journey.

167
00:27:37,949 --> 00:27:42,245
You need money, and a lot more luck
than you've had up to now.

168
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:45,915
You need big balls...

169
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:50,086
and the protection of God
and all the saints.

170
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:54,507
But I guess you have to go.

171
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,426
Because if you stay here,

172
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,097
the only way you can hide from
the army is by turning into a flea.

173
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,607
GOOD HOUSEKEEPING

174
00:28:51,147 --> 00:28:54,401
Rosita, what can we do?

175
00:28:54,484 --> 00:28:58,988
Enrique's life is in danger here.

176
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,157
Enrique is leaving.

177
00:29:01,658 --> 00:29:03,243
He's going north.

178
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:06,955
And I'm going with him.

179
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,040
To the north?

180
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:14,462
Is everything arranged?

181
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,509
We don't have money, Godmother.

182
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:22,762
Help us, please.

183
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,057
Of course I'll help you.

184
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,685
Wait.

185
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,839
I've always wanted to go north,

186
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:02,844
ever since I was a little girl.

187
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:06,931
But I'll never go.
I'm too old now.

188
00:30:12,103 --> 00:30:16,816
These are my savings.

189
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:21,738
Now go to the north for me.

190
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:32,707
Remember.
You have to pretend to be Mexican.

191
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:38,963
Otherwise, if you're caught,
they'll send you right back here,

192
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,174
and that's your death.

193
00:30:41,925 --> 00:30:44,052
It's hard to pretend to be Mexican.

194
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:47,096
Use your head
before they cut it off.

195
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:51,017
Okay, say something like a Mexican.

196
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,436
Tell me it's a hot day.

197
00:30:54,896 --> 00:30:56,272
It's a — No.

198
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,691
It's a hot day.

199
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:00,276
Oh, God!

200
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,238
You won't get a mile past the border!

201
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:07,033
Say it's a "fucking" hot day.

202
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:09,994
Mexicans are always saying "fuck."

203
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:12,622
"Fuck" here,
"fuck" there.

204
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,667
If you don't say "fuck"
all the time,

205
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,877
they'll know you're not Mexican!

206
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:20,838
And if they ask where you're from,

207
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,715
say Oaxaca, Mexico.

208
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,594
Most people can't tell the difference.

209
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:29,305
They think all Indians look alike.

210
00:31:30,473 --> 00:31:32,559
Do you know a good coyote?

211
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,603
Yes. A good one.

212
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:37,939
Without him,
you won't get across.

213
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,482
And remember

214
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:43,152
that the border between
Mexico and the United States

215
00:31:43,236 --> 00:31:45,280
is like a war zone.

216
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,449
Remember.

217
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:11,240
What are you doing?

218
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,743
I'm going with you.

219
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,622
With things the way they are now?

220
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,583
And you're a woman.

221
00:33:20,917 --> 00:33:23,169
And you're a man.

222
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:26,047
They kill them both the same here.

223
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,051
But it's so dangerous.

224
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,138
Ramón says it's like a war.

225
00:33:34,222 --> 00:33:36,182
I probably won't make it.

226
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:38,226
And with you —

227
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:40,937
<i>My sister's crazy.
Everyone is crazy.</i>

228
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,690
There's no other way, Enrique.

229
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:49,487
When the soldiers come back,
they'll take me.

230
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,576
I'm afraid.

231
00:33:55,952 --> 00:33:57,745
I'm so afraid.

232
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:00,248
But the money?
We don't have enough.

233
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,840
And your sweetheart?

234
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,345
The past is gone forever, Enrique.

235
00:34:16,347 --> 00:34:21,185
<i>I've lost my father...
and my mother.</i>

236
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:28,151
<i>And when I thought you were gone,</i>

237
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:31,779
<i>I never felt so alone.</i>

238
00:34:31,863 --> 00:34:35,450
<i>I won't let you leave me.</i>

239
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:43,040
<i>We have to stay together,
whether we live or die.</i>

240
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:48,087
<i>You're my whole family now.</i>

241
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,216
<i>Yes. You're right, Rosita.</i>

242
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:56,763
<i>We have to stay together.</i>

243
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,015
But we're not going to die.

244
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:01,017
We're going to live!

245
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:07,982
And in the north,
we won't be treated this way.

246
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,859
We'll make a lot of money.

247
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:13,070
We'll have everything we want.

248
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:17,492
And we'll return one day.

249
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,411
We'll have good luck now.

250
00:35:21,037 --> 00:35:22,789
I'm sure of it!

251
00:35:37,887 --> 00:35:40,223
Wait.
There's something I must do.

252
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,724
What?

253
00:35:41,808 --> 00:35:43,893
I must do it alone.

254
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:47,980
Wait for me at the edge of town.
- All right. But hurry.

255
00:35:48,064 --> 00:35:49,607
I will.

256
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:13,089
<i>For my father.</i>

257
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:17,426
<i>For my mother.</i>

258
00:36:19,929 --> 00:36:22,265
<i>And for my village.</i>

259
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:37,632
<i>Where are you going, Rosa?</i>

260
00:37:38,549 --> 00:37:42,553
<i>Rosa, where are you going?</i>

261
00:37:43,262 --> 00:37:44,805
Rosa, are you all right?

262
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,056
What's the matter?
Are you all right?

263
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:31,394
I'm fine. Let's hurry.

264
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:34,105
Let's go... to the north.

265
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,837
Motherfucking tire!

266
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:53,893
Goddamn tire!
Fucking son of a bitch!

267
00:39:53,976 --> 00:39:56,353
Piece of shit.

268
00:40:00,274 --> 00:40:01,984
What the hell?

269
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:11,827
What the fuck are you doing there?

270
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:15,206
Cat got your tongue?

271
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:18,459
Little tramps.

272
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:23,130
Where are you going?
What direction?

273
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:27,927
Same way you're going.

274
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,846
Same way?
Where are you from?

275
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:35,184
- Oaxaca, Mexico.
- Oaxaca?

276
00:40:38,979 --> 00:40:40,689
So you're from Oaxaca, eh?

277
00:40:45,027 --> 00:40:46,779
You're really fucked-up.

278
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:49,198
You're coming from
where we're going to!

279
00:40:51,659 --> 00:40:53,202
Idiots!

280
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:57,331
Oaxaca is 300 kilometers ahead!

281
00:41:01,127 --> 00:41:03,003
Guatemalans, aren't you?

282
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,214
Got you!

283
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:10,386
Just help me fix this damn tire,

284
00:41:10,469 --> 00:41:13,931
and then I'll give you
a mother of a ride.

285
00:41:22,273 --> 00:41:24,567
How did you get across the border?

286
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:28,946
They've got fuckloads of soldiers
there, so when you try to cross —

287
00:41:29,572 --> 00:41:34,869
Yes, but Enrique knows
the mountain paths.

288
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:39,540
Done some smuggling, huh?

289
00:41:40,749 --> 00:41:42,835
You like Mexican music?

290
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:45,296
Yes, I like it.

291
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:47,923
It's the best!

292
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:58,309
Hey, motherfucker!

293
00:41:58,851 --> 00:42:00,311
Move your ass!

294
00:42:00,644 --> 00:42:03,230
That's why God gave you one!

295
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,689
I can't stand drafts!
Can't you understand?

296
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:39,994
Goddamn Indians!
You should die for this!

297
00:43:41,704 --> 00:43:43,706
Old fart.

298
00:45:11,335 --> 00:45:13,962
You can't escape me this time,
you bastard!

299
00:45:16,924 --> 00:45:19,718
We're here — Tijuana.

300
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,845
The shit-hole of the world.

301
00:45:36,193 --> 00:45:38,779
Come on.
I'm a good coyote.

302
00:45:38,862 --> 00:45:42,491
Hey, only $300 to the north!

303
00:45:43,117 --> 00:45:45,786
I'm the one! Come on.

304
00:45:47,454 --> 00:45:50,499
I'm bold. I'll take you there
on the wings of destiny!

305
00:45:50,582 --> 00:45:52,084
Don't be left behind!

306
00:45:52,167 --> 00:45:55,462
Come on, miss.
I'll take you to the north.

307
00:45:55,546 --> 00:45:57,631
Come here! Don't miss out!

308
00:45:57,714 --> 00:46:00,884
Let's cross the border!
Don't be left behind!

309
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:02,928
I'll take you for $300 each!

310
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:07,099
It's the ultimate for the poor!
Let's go, "little chicks" — north!

311
00:46:07,182 --> 00:46:11,228
You won't have to sleep on the floor.

312
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,981
Not like here,
where you're dying of hunger.

313
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:17,234
It's the land of money,

314
00:46:17,317 --> 00:46:20,737
where you'll find beautiful
houses, big cars.

315
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:24,199
It's the most beautiful thing in life!

316
00:46:24,283 --> 00:46:26,243
Come with me, to the north!

317
00:46:32,624 --> 00:46:34,668
What a pair of dummies.

318
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:38,547
Don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.

319
00:46:39,381 --> 00:46:41,341
Dumb as animals.

320
00:46:50,476 --> 00:46:53,770
What's going on here?

321
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:56,690
Jaime, these donkeys just arrived.

322
00:46:56,773 --> 00:47:00,319
They're looking for their coyote,
but they don't have his address.

323
00:47:01,236 --> 00:47:04,114
They think they're
in their little village, the jerks!

324
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:08,619
What a couple of turkeys!

325
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:12,873
Yeah, too bad they're not smart
like all of you geniuses, huh?

326
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:16,919
If you're so brilliant, what are
you doing here in Tijuana, barefoot?

327
00:47:17,002 --> 00:47:20,589
Come on! Get out of here!
Leave them alone!

328
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:29,640
Don't mind those idiots.

329
00:47:29,806 --> 00:47:31,517
Just arrived?

330
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:34,811
Where are you from?
- We're from Oaxaca.

331
00:47:35,521 --> 00:47:37,523
I'm from Zacatecas.

332
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:39,149
My name is Jaime.

333
00:47:39,441 --> 00:47:41,109
I'm Enrique.

334
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:44,947
This is my sister, Rosa.
- It's a pleasure.

335
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,949
Who are you looking for?

336
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:48,534
Raimundo Gutierrez.

337
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:51,662
A friend of someone in our village.

338
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:54,122
- Do you have his address?
- Yes —

339
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:57,084
We had it.

340
00:47:57,834 --> 00:47:59,795
But he doesn't live here anymore.

341
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:01,880
I see.

342
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:05,968
Do you have any money?

343
00:48:08,971 --> 00:48:11,473
Well, yes.

344
00:48:12,558 --> 00:48:13,809
A lot?

345
00:48:17,229 --> 00:48:19,898
Yes... I think so.

346
00:48:20,148 --> 00:48:22,109
Let me give you some advice.

347
00:48:22,192 --> 00:48:24,361
Don't give it to anybody.

348
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:28,323
You'll need it when you
get to the north, understand?

349
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:33,078
And about finding your friend,

350
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,997
I'd help you, but

351
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,207
I'm crossing tonight.

352
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:41,003
Maybe you want to stay
and look for your friend.

353
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:45,507
But if you want to cross,
you can try your luck with me.

354
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,554
Yes, we'd like to!

355
00:48:51,638 --> 00:48:53,348
It's not that hard, believe me.

356
00:48:56,226 --> 00:49:00,063
Do you want a place
to stay until we leave?

357
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:03,233
If we're going tonight, yes.

358
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:22,127
Here, stay in here.

359
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,963
What if the owner comes back?

360
00:49:25,047 --> 00:49:29,092
Rosa, look around you.

361
00:49:29,176 --> 00:49:31,053
This is a "lost city" —

362
00:49:31,136 --> 00:49:32,679
people come and go.

363
00:49:32,763 --> 00:49:35,891
No one knows or cares
how many people are here.

364
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:39,853
And no one owns anything here.

365
00:49:41,605 --> 00:49:45,067
At dusk, I'll come for you,
and we'll cross.

366
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,610
All right?
- All right.

367
00:49:46,693 --> 00:49:49,613
- See you later.
- Until tonight.

368
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,464
I told you we'd be lucky!

369
00:50:08,298 --> 00:50:15,055
Imagine, meeting someone like him
on our first day here.

370
00:50:15,597 --> 00:50:18,308
You're easily impressed.

371
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:23,355
And you can't appreciate good luck,
even if it comes up and bites you.

372
00:50:23,438 --> 00:50:27,359
It's so hot and dusty.

373
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:29,403
It's not like San Pedro.

374
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:31,321
What are you saying?

375
00:50:31,405 --> 00:50:34,825
Are you homesick?
Would you rather be in San Pedro?

376
00:50:34,908 --> 00:50:38,370
I just said it was hot,
that's all.

377
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:41,623
I'm not homesick.

378
00:50:43,125 --> 00:50:46,545
I don't want to be in San Pedro.
I'm not thinking about that.

379
00:50:46,712 --> 00:50:49,840
If you think about things like that,
you'll go crazy.

380
00:50:49,923 --> 00:50:53,427
Okay, forget it.
We won't talk about it anymore.

381
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,804
Go to sleep,
because tonight you won't be able to.

382
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,986
Do you suppose all these people...

383
00:51:11,987 --> 00:51:15,323
are trying to go north like us?

384
00:51:16,992 --> 00:51:18,952
Yes, I think they are.

385
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,831
That's a lot of people.

386
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:26,918
Go to sleep.
If you worry about that,

387
00:51:27,002 --> 00:51:30,881
you'll go crazy even faster
than if you think about San Pedro.

388
00:51:30,964 --> 00:51:33,133
You're so practical, Rosa.

389
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:34,718
Go to sleep.

390
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:02,746
This is the hole.

391
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,207
Careful. Be as quiet as cats.

392
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:40,408
I'll be right back.
Wait here.

393
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:09,980
He's just peeing.

394
00:53:58,904 --> 00:54:01,448
Robbing you is a pain in the ass!

395
00:54:01,531 --> 00:54:04,200
You're a mean motherfucker!

396
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,996
How much dough
do you have anyway?

397
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,372
Dough?

398
00:54:09,456 --> 00:54:12,500
Money, idiot!
Can't you speak Spanish?

399
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:16,129
Twenty dollars.

400
00:54:16,212 --> 00:54:17,422
What?

401
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,841
I'll be fucked!

402
00:54:19,925 --> 00:54:21,676
You said you had a lot!

403
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,180
- That is a lot.
- Go to hell!

404
00:54:25,764 --> 00:54:30,060
Now I've had my balls busted
for a lousy 20 bucks!

405
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,811
Motherfucker.

406
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:42,697
Don't move!

407
00:54:50,372 --> 00:54:52,958
<i>Oaxaca, Mexico.</i>

408
00:54:56,711 --> 00:54:59,005
Yes, Oaxaca also.

409
00:55:27,242 --> 00:55:30,161
Do you know how to read and write?

410
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:33,081
<i>Why does he want to know that?</i>

411
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:35,083
<i>I don't know,</i>

412
00:55:35,625 --> 00:55:39,254
<i>but I think it's a trick.</i>

413
00:55:41,006 --> 00:55:43,925
<i>We'd better lie.</i>

414
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,603
We can't read or write.

415
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:13,955
Show me exactly
where you are from.

416
00:56:18,543 --> 00:56:20,420
What the fuck?

417
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:24,424
What's this fucking thing
you're showing me?

418
00:56:25,175 --> 00:56:27,969
What the fuck
are you talking about?

419
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:51,951
Come and get your sweet rolls!

420
00:56:52,035 --> 00:56:54,496
Hot tamales!
How many do you want?

421
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:04,964
Hey! Thief!
Goddamn thief!

422
00:57:05,048 --> 00:57:06,466
Police!

423
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:09,052
Lazy bastards!
What are you laughing at?

424
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,116
I'm looking for Raimundo Gutierrez.

425
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:37,413
I'm Raimundo.

426
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,752
- I want to go north.
- You're wasting your time, kid.

427
00:57:42,836 --> 00:57:45,171
I stopped being a coyote a while ago.

428
00:57:45,255 --> 00:57:47,090
It's too dangerous.

429
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:50,885
I don't take anyone across.
No one!

430
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,178
Wait.

431
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:54,889
I'm a friend of Ramón Muñoz.

432
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,600
He gave me your name.

433
00:58:02,897 --> 00:58:05,233
Seems like you haven't
eaten in a week.

434
00:58:07,902 --> 00:58:09,654
But you're lucky.

435
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,197
You're alive.

436
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:14,325
Can you help us?

437
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,328
Ramón is a good friend of mine.

438
00:58:18,371 --> 00:58:20,415
I owe him some favors.

439
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:26,087
I guess I'll have to help you.

440
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:32,093
I suppose you don't have
much money.

441
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:37,807
I won't charge you much.
I'm doing it for Ramón.

442
00:58:39,017 --> 00:58:41,019
But you have to give me something.

443
00:58:41,102 --> 00:58:44,230
There's a lot of expenses.
- How much?

444
00:58:44,314 --> 00:58:46,733
About $100.

445
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,861
There's gas, food, hotel.

446
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,654
Don't worry.

447
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:53,781
We'll get the money.

448
00:58:54,991 --> 00:58:56,659
Your sister.

449
00:58:57,285 --> 00:58:58,620
Is she strong?

450
00:58:59,662 --> 00:59:03,666
I think she's stronger
than both of us together.

451
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,001
Good.

452
00:59:05,084 --> 00:59:08,588
Because I'm not going to
take you through the mountains.

453
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,466
Too risky.

454
00:59:12,592 --> 00:59:14,469
There's one other way.

455
00:59:15,303 --> 00:59:17,055
The tunnels.

456
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:19,432
And it's horrible.

457
00:59:20,308 --> 00:59:24,020
The old sewer tunnels that
connect Tijuana with the other side.

458
00:59:24,312 --> 00:59:26,522
They haven't been used for years,

459
00:59:26,814 --> 00:59:28,983
so they're empty.

460
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,070
The safest ones are the smallest.

461
00:59:33,071 --> 00:59:37,492
But you have to crawl
on your hands and knees for miles.

462
00:59:39,494 --> 00:59:41,746
It's safer than the mountains,

463
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:46,000
but it's really hell.

464
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:48,670
You can't hear anything.

465
00:59:49,671 --> 00:59:51,422
You can't see.

466
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:53,675
And the stink —

467
00:59:55,969 --> 00:59:57,345
It's safer.

468
00:59:59,514 --> 01:00:03,184
But most people would rather
go through the mountains...

469
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:07,355
and risk getting robbed or shot!

470
01:00:23,705 --> 01:00:25,707
Look what I have for you.

471
01:00:25,999 --> 01:00:29,002
Some fruit and a sweet roll.

472
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:33,840
I brought something for you too.

473
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:35,049
A steak!

474
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,553
Where did you get that?

475
01:00:39,554 --> 01:00:41,764
I had a big lunch

476
01:00:41,848 --> 01:00:44,517
with Raimundo Gutierrez!

477
01:00:45,435 --> 01:00:47,478
You found him!

478
01:00:47,562 --> 01:00:48,980
Yes!

479
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:51,607
And he's going to take us north!

480
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:55,903
There's just one thing.

481
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:59,949
We have to get $100.

482
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,259
This is pure silver.

483
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:24,223
This will get us the money.

484
01:01:24,307 --> 01:01:25,975
Mother's necklaces?

485
01:01:31,356 --> 01:01:33,274
No, we can't sell them.

486
01:01:37,904 --> 01:01:40,198
If we want to go north,

487
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,786
there's no other way.

488
01:02:18,194 --> 01:02:22,115
It will seem like you'll never get out.

489
01:02:22,990 --> 01:02:25,660
But I want you to keep going.

490
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:28,704
And when you get to the other end,
I'll be there waiting.

491
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:30,748
I promise.

492
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:39,715
May the Virgin take care of you.

493
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:08,971
What's that?

494
01:04:12,934 --> 01:04:15,228
I think it's a dead cat.

495
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:17,480
Come on.

496
01:07:30,131 --> 01:07:31,507
Are you all right?

497
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:38,472
Yes, Enrique.

498
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:54,572
Let's go.
We have to keep going.

499
01:09:26,831 --> 01:09:28,749
I can see the end!

500
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:33,600
It's me.

501
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:34,893
Raimundo.

502
01:12:34,977 --> 01:12:38,272
Of course.
I said I'd be here,

503
01:12:38,355 --> 01:12:40,107
and here I am.

504
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:42,359
Just like I promised.

505
01:12:42,776 --> 01:12:45,029
I brought you some sandwiches.

506
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:50,367
You've got a first-class coyote!

507
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,462
Rosita, come here!

508
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:25,110
That's San Diego.

509
01:13:25,402 --> 01:13:26,904
Pretty, isn't it?

510
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:29,990
From here, it's easy.

511
01:13:30,741 --> 01:13:33,077
Tomorrow we'll be in Los Angeles.

512
01:16:31,672 --> 01:16:33,006
Very simple,

513
01:16:33,548 --> 01:16:38,720
but very comfortable
and very safe!

514
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,193
I'll come for you in the morning.

515
01:16:53,694 --> 01:16:54,695
Yes.

516
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,701
Good night.

517
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:43,327
Josefita was right.

518
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,579
We have a flush toilet.

519
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:48,206
And we have electric light.

520
01:17:49,916 --> 01:17:52,252
Now all we need to do is

521
01:17:52,336 --> 01:17:54,880
to buy a new car without money.

522
01:18:15,609 --> 01:18:17,944
Josefita and her crazy stories.

523
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,581
- What's your name?
- Rosa.

524
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,249
I'm Nacha.

525
01:19:54,332 --> 01:19:57,210
Look.
When you get a bundle to iron,

526
01:19:57,294 --> 01:20:00,922
find the ticket that says "pressing."

527
01:20:01,798 --> 01:20:06,887
Tear it out and keep it.

528
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:10,390
They'll pay you 30 cents —

529
01:20:11,892 --> 01:20:13,518
for each piece.

530
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:14,686
Understand?

531
01:20:15,729 --> 01:20:19,983
And be careful.
This is steam.

532
01:23:43,436 --> 01:23:45,605
Look! Look!

533
01:23:47,315 --> 01:23:48,316
What?

534
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:52,487
Look at those ladies.
They're like something in a magazine!

535
01:23:57,534 --> 01:24:00,412
And I don't look like a model?

536
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:03,206
Iron.

537
01:24:04,999 --> 01:24:07,293
Because you look normal.

538
01:24:28,231 --> 01:24:29,441
Run!

539
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,577
What's this?

540
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,704
It's a croissant.

541
01:25:25,163 --> 01:25:28,041
It doesn't fill you up like a tortilla,
but it's good. Eat it.

542
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:31,711
Where are you from?

543
01:25:31,794 --> 01:25:33,421
From Oaxaca.

544
01:25:33,713 --> 01:25:34,923
I'm from Chihuahua.

545
01:25:35,006 --> 01:25:37,675
It's nice to have
another Mexican here.

546
01:25:39,719 --> 01:25:41,888
He's Mexican too, isn't he?

547
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,516
Him? No, he's a "pocho."

548
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:46,768
The dummy can't even speak Spanish.

549
01:25:46,851 --> 01:25:50,396
Hey, Carlos.
Is it true you have testicles for eyes?

550
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:57,529
Suck my sweet potato, asshole.

551
01:26:02,158 --> 01:26:03,618
What's a "pocho"?

552
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,537
A Chicano.

553
01:26:07,413 --> 01:26:09,165
What's a Chicano?

554
01:26:11,417 --> 01:26:13,336
Well, he's an American citizen,

555
01:26:13,419 --> 01:26:15,713
but he comes from
a Mexican family.

556
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:19,551
That's why he has to do
the same shit work we do.

557
01:26:32,397 --> 01:26:35,567
I always check out a place
before I take a job.

558
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:39,821
If I can't find a good escape route,
screw the job.

559
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:45,326
Sit down, my treat.

560
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:48,997
Hey, sweetie!

561
01:26:49,080 --> 01:26:53,251
Give me two burritos with
green chili and two coffees.

562
01:26:57,589 --> 01:27:00,008
Where are all the gringos?

563
01:27:01,384 --> 01:27:05,430
Look at this street.
It's just like Mexico City.

564
01:27:06,014 --> 01:27:10,602
Oh, Lord. You don't think gringos
want to live with Mexicans, do you?

565
01:27:11,728 --> 01:27:14,063
They live out there
in their own neighborhoods.

566
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:21,029
Listen. I've been thinking.

567
01:27:22,363 --> 01:27:25,950
I think I'll go back
to cleaning houses.

568
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:30,288
It's safer, and with my contacts —

569
01:27:33,249 --> 01:27:38,087
Listen. Maybe we'll be lucky
and get some big houses to clean!

570
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:40,340
What do you say?
You want to team up?

571
01:27:40,423 --> 01:27:42,342
- Yes.
- Okay. It's a deal.

572
01:27:43,676 --> 01:27:46,638
But you have to learn some English.

573
01:27:46,721 --> 01:27:49,349
Yes, I want to learn English.

574
01:27:49,724 --> 01:27:54,020
And I know where you can do it.
In the public schools it's free.

575
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:57,523
The government?
Isn't it dangerous?

576
01:27:57,899 --> 01:28:01,402
No, it's the safest.
They never ask questions.

577
01:28:01,486 --> 01:28:02,820
Why?

578
01:28:05,490 --> 01:28:08,242
If you try to figure out gringos,

579
01:28:08,326 --> 01:28:11,120
you'll just get a giant headache.

580
01:28:11,204 --> 01:28:12,664
They're cuckoo.

581
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,503
You know, you look like an Indian.

582
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:24,592
That is... a little change
of clothes wouldn't hurt, eh?

583
01:28:25,385 --> 01:28:27,178
Have you ever heard of Sears?

584
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:35,812
What happened to you?

585
01:28:35,895 --> 01:28:37,105
Nothing.

586
01:28:37,355 --> 01:28:40,608
Nothing!
What do you mean, nothing?

587
01:28:40,692 --> 01:28:43,361
Everybody's talking about the "migra" raid!

588
01:28:44,195 --> 01:28:46,447
I didn't know what happened to you,

589
01:28:46,531 --> 01:28:48,199
if I would ever see you again.

590
01:28:48,282 --> 01:28:50,284
I'm sorry.
I escaped.

591
01:28:50,368 --> 01:28:53,121
I met a smart woman.
I was lucky.

592
01:28:53,204 --> 01:28:55,164
Rosa, no one escaped but you!

593
01:28:55,248 --> 01:28:57,458
I've been crazy with worry.

594
01:28:57,542 --> 01:28:59,252
And just look at you!

595
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:02,255
What's wrong with the way I look?

596
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:03,840
Nothing, but...

597
01:29:04,424 --> 01:29:06,384
you look like a clown.

598
01:29:07,385 --> 01:29:09,846
No, I look like an American.

599
01:29:09,929 --> 01:29:13,015
And I'm going to work with Nacha,
cleaning houses!

600
01:29:13,099 --> 01:29:15,435
What are you talking about?
Who's Nacha?

601
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:17,854
Enrique, we have to learn English.

602
01:29:18,104 --> 01:29:20,273
Rosa, don't change the subject.

603
01:29:20,815 --> 01:29:23,151
It's a good idea, don't you think?

604
01:29:23,234 --> 01:29:24,569
I guess so.

605
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,488
But what circus
did you escape from?

606
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:33,299
Do you understand how this works?

607
01:32:33,382 --> 01:32:36,302
Sure. Anyway, we'll figure it out.

608
01:32:36,552 --> 01:32:42,475
The important thing is, whatever they say,
just smile and say yes.

609
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:08,245
Can you operate the machine?

610
01:35:08,329 --> 01:35:10,539
Yes, a little.

611
01:35:11,957 --> 01:35:13,793
It's very complicated.

612
01:35:20,925 --> 01:35:23,219
Rosita, why did you
wash the clothes like that?

613
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:30,059
I don't know.

614
01:35:31,769 --> 01:35:33,062
No, I don't know.

615
01:35:36,649 --> 01:35:38,150
What?

616
01:35:38,234 --> 01:35:41,779
What difference does it make
how I do it?

617
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:44,615
The clothes are clean, right?

618
01:36:05,261 --> 01:36:07,346
It does matter how you do it.

619
01:36:07,429 --> 01:36:09,140
You have to do it in the machine.

620
01:36:09,223 --> 01:36:11,892
That's how it is done in the north.

621
01:36:11,976 --> 01:36:14,395
You always use machines.

622
01:39:30,841 --> 01:39:32,343
Look at me!

623
01:39:33,886 --> 01:39:35,512
What happened?

624
01:39:37,097 --> 01:39:39,224
You look wonderful.

625
01:39:39,308 --> 01:39:41,894
I've been promoted!

626
01:39:42,394 --> 01:39:45,689
See?
I'm becoming somebody important!

627
01:39:54,782 --> 01:39:57,117
I'm very proud of you, Enrique.

628
01:39:58,410 --> 01:39:59,703
Very proud.

629
01:40:00,788 --> 01:40:04,166
I want to tell you something
that Papa told me before —

630
01:40:05,793 --> 01:40:07,503
before he was killed.

631
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:10,047
He told me that,

632
01:40:10,130 --> 01:40:11,715
for the rich,

633
01:40:13,217 --> 01:40:16,220
all peasants are just a pair of arms
to do their work.

634
01:40:17,763 --> 01:40:20,432
But he wanted something more for me.

635
01:40:21,225 --> 01:40:24,144
He wanted people to know

636
01:40:24,228 --> 01:40:29,191
that I'm a man
with a heart and a soul.

637
01:40:29,983 --> 01:40:31,819
Look at me now!

638
01:40:31,902 --> 01:40:34,238
People will see me
and respect me.

639
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:38,784
In this country you work hard,

640
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:41,578
but you can get somewhere.

641
01:40:41,662 --> 01:40:43,580
I told you, Rosa,

642
01:40:43,664 --> 01:40:46,166
things would change for us.

643
01:40:46,250 --> 01:40:48,710
We've had hard times,

644
01:40:49,336 --> 01:40:50,963
but look.

645
01:40:52,131 --> 01:40:54,383
Nothing can stop us now.

646
01:40:54,591 --> 01:40:55,926
Nothing.

647
01:40:57,845 --> 01:40:58,929
Come in.

648
01:42:10,959 --> 01:42:12,711
Big city, far away.

649
01:42:13,462 --> 01:42:15,964
- Far?
- Very far away.

650
01:43:11,061 --> 01:43:12,563
Excuse me.

651
01:43:42,342 --> 01:43:44,636
Let me see it.

652
01:43:45,804 --> 01:43:47,347
Let's go celebrate, okay?

653
01:43:47,431 --> 01:43:50,601
I'd like to, but I have to go home.

654
01:43:50,684 --> 01:43:51,893
Why?

655
01:43:51,977 --> 01:43:53,729
I have to go see my sister.

656
01:43:53,812 --> 01:43:56,189
Oh, fuck!
It's always your sister!

657
01:43:56,273 --> 01:43:57,858
She's a woman.
You're a man.

658
01:43:57,941 --> 01:44:00,736
You can do what you want!

659
01:44:00,819 --> 01:44:02,613
What do you say?
Let's celebrate.

660
01:44:03,196 --> 01:44:04,781
All right.

661
01:44:43,487 --> 01:44:45,781
Here you are with your napkin.

662
01:44:49,326 --> 01:44:50,619
You asshole.

663
01:45:21,566 --> 01:45:22,901
Who's there?

664
01:45:23,402 --> 01:45:24,861
Come in.

665
01:45:27,447 --> 01:45:29,449
What's the matter?

666
01:45:29,533 --> 01:45:31,451
I was better,
but now I'm much worse.

667
01:45:31,535 --> 01:45:33,870
You have the fever of hell!

668
01:45:33,954 --> 01:45:35,497
It's very bad!

669
01:49:42,744 --> 01:49:43,787
<i>Mother!</i>

670
01:49:43,870 --> 01:49:46,247
<i>Good morning.
Hurry up now.</i>

671
01:49:46,331 --> 01:49:48,458
<i>You have to go to work.</i>

672
01:49:52,587 --> 01:49:53,964
<i>But, Mother —</i>

673
01:49:54,881 --> 01:49:57,676
It's so hard to make tortillas on this stove.

674
01:49:58,969 --> 01:50:00,971
If only I had my comal.

675
01:50:01,888 --> 01:50:03,640
But what can we do?

676
01:50:04,182 --> 01:50:06,059
Life here is so hard.

677
01:50:06,393 --> 01:50:10,063
You have to buy food,
pay rent —

678
01:50:10,146 --> 01:50:12,107
It's all so expensive!

679
01:50:12,732 --> 01:50:15,986
They told us that in the north
you could make a lot of money,

680
01:50:16,361 --> 01:50:19,614
but they never told us
you had to spend so much.

681
01:50:22,951 --> 01:50:24,619
It's your father.

682
01:50:24,703 --> 01:50:26,663
Go see what he wants.

683
01:50:48,601 --> 01:50:51,896
Look, Rosita.
I cut these for you.

684
01:51:44,199 --> 01:51:46,618
What's the matter?

685
01:51:46,701 --> 01:51:48,328
What happened?

686
01:51:48,411 --> 01:51:51,081
What happened?
<i>- Mother.</i>

687
01:52:24,030 --> 01:52:25,740
Jorge! Immigration!

688
01:52:25,824 --> 01:52:27,951
Holy shit, run!

689
01:53:04,445 --> 01:53:08,533
No, no. They'll send me back!
I can't go to the hospital.

690
01:53:08,616 --> 01:53:12,829
They'll send me back,
and I'll be murdered! No!

691
01:55:51,070 --> 01:55:53,573
At least we got away.

692
01:55:53,656 --> 01:55:55,783
Let's drink to that.

693
01:55:55,867 --> 01:55:58,244
Yeah, but we don't have any work.

694
01:55:58,328 --> 01:56:00,288
We're really fucked.

695
01:56:00,997 --> 01:56:02,915
We'll find something else.

696
01:56:02,999 --> 01:56:04,917
It's not so easy.

697
01:56:05,209 --> 01:56:08,004
Being out of work up here
is the worst.

698
01:56:08,588 --> 01:56:11,090
There are so many people now

699
01:56:11,174 --> 01:56:13,384
and not so much work
as there used to be.

700
01:56:14,093 --> 01:56:16,846
It was that "pocho" who turned us in.

701
01:56:18,348 --> 01:56:19,807
The "pocho"?

702
01:56:20,683 --> 01:56:22,310
How do you know?

703
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:24,020
Easy.

704
01:56:24,103 --> 01:56:27,357
The "migra" doesn't show up
just because their balls itch.

705
01:56:27,440 --> 01:56:29,233
Someone has to call.

706
01:56:29,567 --> 01:56:33,363
He's been pissed off
ever since you got promoted.

707
01:56:34,155 --> 01:56:36,783
That's the way it is here.

708
01:56:37,033 --> 01:56:40,328
You've got to look out for yourself,
or you're fucked.

709
01:56:40,620 --> 01:56:43,831
You do whatever
you have to do to survive.

710
01:56:44,207 --> 01:56:46,334
That's what the "pocho" did.

711
01:56:53,257 --> 01:56:55,301
That's the way it is.

712
01:56:55,385 --> 01:56:59,055
That's the way it is — reality.

713
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:08,564
None of this would happen if only
we had those damned papers!

714
02:03:41,457 --> 02:03:44,835
Thank God I found you!
You've got to come with me immediately.

715
02:03:44,919 --> 02:03:47,713
- What's going on?
- Rosa is in the hospital!

716
02:03:47,797 --> 02:03:49,715
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

717
02:03:49,799 --> 02:03:53,093
She got sick this morning.
The doctor said I had to get you.

718
02:03:53,177 --> 02:03:56,430
But I can't go right now.

719
02:03:56,514 --> 02:03:57,973
Why?

720
02:03:58,057 --> 02:03:59,809
I've got to leave.

721
02:04:00,351 --> 02:04:04,021
I'm going to Chicago, tonight.

722
02:04:04,104 --> 02:04:06,732
What are you saying?
Are you crazy?

723
02:04:06,816 --> 02:04:08,776
Rosa is in the hospital!

724
02:04:09,527 --> 02:04:11,153
You take care of her, Nacha.

725
02:04:11,695 --> 02:04:12,988
She'll get better.

726
02:04:13,656 --> 02:04:15,407
I know it.

727
02:04:15,491 --> 02:04:17,409
I'll call when I arrive.

728
02:04:18,494 --> 02:04:21,247
Nacha, I must go!

729
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:23,457
I don't have a job!

730
02:04:25,459 --> 02:04:27,920
I don't have much time.
I must go now.

731
02:04:28,921 --> 02:04:31,882
Nacha, take care of her, please.

732
02:04:33,175 --> 02:04:35,010
I can't believe it.

733
02:04:35,094 --> 02:04:37,388
The doctor told me to find you.

734
02:04:37,471 --> 02:04:39,723
Rosa could die!

735
02:04:40,850 --> 02:04:43,686
Listen to me!
She could die!

736
02:04:43,769 --> 02:04:46,730
Leave me alone!
Leave me!

737
02:04:47,731 --> 02:04:49,358
All right.

738
02:04:50,192 --> 02:04:52,069
Rosa may be dying,

739
02:04:52,528 --> 02:04:53,863
but you...

740
02:04:54,989 --> 02:04:56,699
are already dead.

741
02:07:20,300 --> 02:07:22,302
<i>Are you feeling better, Rosa?</i>

742
02:07:22,553 --> 02:07:23,637
Yes.

743
02:07:28,642 --> 02:07:32,688
In my dreams, I felt afraid.

744
02:07:35,524 --> 02:07:39,194
I felt like that day in San Pedro

745
02:07:39,278 --> 02:07:42,197
when I thought
you would never come back.

746
02:07:45,200 --> 02:07:46,910
But when I woke up,

747
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:50,497
you were here...

748
02:07:52,291 --> 02:07:54,043
with me.

749
02:07:54,877 --> 02:07:56,295
Of course.

750
02:07:58,255 --> 02:08:00,549
You're the only family I have.

751
02:08:01,550 --> 02:08:03,677
We have to stay together.

752
02:08:05,345 --> 02:08:08,807
Life here is very hard, Enrique.

753
02:08:11,060 --> 02:08:13,937
We're not free.

754
02:08:15,773 --> 02:08:19,234
Isn't it true that we're not free?

755
02:08:21,153 --> 02:08:26,033
Yes, life is difficult here.

756
02:08:26,283 --> 02:08:27,409
It's true.

757
02:08:28,243 --> 02:08:30,204
You have to work very hard.

758
02:08:33,123 --> 02:08:34,833
In our own land,

759
02:08:35,667 --> 02:08:38,128
we have no home.

760
02:08:39,963 --> 02:08:42,049
They want to kill us.

761
02:08:43,759 --> 02:08:46,512
There's no home for us there.

762
02:08:49,807 --> 02:08:52,601
In Mexico there is only poverty.

763
02:08:54,353 --> 02:08:57,940
We can't make a home there either.

764
02:08:59,566 --> 02:09:03,362
And here in the north,

765
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:08,200
we aren't accepted.

766
02:09:12,121 --> 02:09:15,457
When will we find a home, Enrique?

767
02:09:20,129 --> 02:09:23,841
Maybe when we die
we'll find a home.

768
02:09:25,175 --> 02:09:27,261
Don't say that, Rosita.

769
02:09:29,263 --> 02:09:30,931
It's hard,

770
02:09:31,473 --> 02:09:33,642
but we're going to have luck.

771
02:09:36,520 --> 02:09:41,275
And we'll get everything we want.

772
02:09:41,567 --> 02:09:43,569
And we'll make a lot of money.

773
02:09:45,654 --> 02:09:47,614
And we'll return to our village.

774
02:09:49,158 --> 02:09:51,201
And when we walk down the streets,

775
02:09:51,702 --> 02:09:53,787
people will look at us with envy.

776
02:09:55,372 --> 02:09:57,374
Things are changing.

777
02:09:59,501 --> 02:10:02,504
Yes, we'll have a lot of luck now.

778
02:10:03,172 --> 02:10:04,923
I'm sure of it.

779
02:10:06,508 --> 02:10:08,510
The only thing is to not lose faith.

780
02:10:09,761 --> 02:10:11,221
That's it.

781
02:10:11,847 --> 02:10:14,224
The important thing
is not to lose faith.

782
02:13:59,074 --> 02:14:02,202
Okay, come on.
I need men with strong arms to work.

783
02:14:02,285 --> 02:14:05,455
- Me! Take me!
- I'm strong! I can work!

784
02:14:11,795 --> 02:14:14,381
Me! Take me!
I have strong arms!
