1
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,765
Don't move.

2
00:01:41,475 --> 00:01:42,643
Turn around.

3
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:53,529
Keep your hands wide.

4
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:05,750
You want something
from me, mister?

5
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,545
Sure came up quiet.
Got to give you credit.

6
00:02:11,922 --> 00:02:13,132
My name's Tate.

7
00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:14,884
Guess that don't mean
much to you,

8
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,886
or anyone else, huh?

9
00:02:16,969 --> 00:02:18,220
This here is Pokey.

10
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,098
You fixing to meet somebody?

11
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,684
Meet somebody? Who?

12
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,396
Wouldn't mind if I did.

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,440
Wouldn't care who he was
or where he comes from

14
00:02:29,523 --> 00:02:31,359
or what he does.

15
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,903
A man ought to always
mind his own business, I say.

16
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,283
Looks like you're the one
expecting company.

17
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,036
How long have you been here?

18
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:45,039
Been poking around these hills
three or four weeks now.

19
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:47,416
Got no calendar to know exact.

20
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,628
Got nothing to show
for it either.

21
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:52,505
If you're ready to talk some,
I'd appreciate

22
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,090
your putting that gun down.

23
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,675
You might get bee stung
or something

24
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,301
but I'd be just as dead.

25
00:03:03,849 --> 00:03:06,560
Got some breakfast
coffee boiling.

26
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,270
- You want some?
- No.

27
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,981
Eh, tobacco?

28
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,738
This party you're asking
after...

29
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,031
Friend of yours?

30
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,409
He killed a marshal.

31
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,711
Kansas?

32
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:33,212
You've come a ways.

33
00:03:34,755 --> 00:03:37,883
It ain't every peace officer
who'd do that.

34
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,052
I ain't seen Kansas
since before the war,

35
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,972
so I wouldn't know
you to look at.

36
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:46,016
My name's Tate, like I said.
Jesse Tate.

37
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,229
Howard Kemp.

38
00:03:50,312 --> 00:03:53,065
You figure he's back
in these hills, Mr. Kemp?

39
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,734
I lost his trail
this side of the river.

40
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,820
- Did you see any sign?
- Hmm.

41
00:03:57,903 --> 00:04:00,156
Ran across a dead fire
the other day.

42
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,368
- Where?
- Back in there.

43
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,996
Got no map to tell you sure.

44
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:08,956
Now, you can tell me
better than that.

45
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,543
Maybe. If we was going the same
way, but we ain't.

46
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:15,129
You got your job, mister,
and I got mine.

47
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:18,007
Helping you don't put
no money in my pocket.

48
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:21,427
- I got $20 here.
- $20!

49
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,764
$20. It's yours if you get
me on a fresh trail.

50
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,348
$20! Ah!

51
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:27,558
$10 now...

52
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:31,187
$10 now, $10 when we find him.

53
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,355
Start out by showing me
that dead fire.

54
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,234
Does this fellow know
you're after him?

55
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:38,611
He knows.

56
00:04:38,694 --> 00:04:40,334
Then he might be waiting
behind some rock.

57
00:04:40,404 --> 00:04:42,490
Waiting for us to ride up
in front of his gun.

58
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,494
He might.

59
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,722
It was still warm yesterday.

60
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,184
Horses moved out this way.
More than one, for sure.

61
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,061
This fellow got company?

62
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:13,687
Could be packing an extra horse.

63
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,440
But there might be two of them
waiting for us, huh?

64
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,025
That's why you held
the gun on me.

65
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,485
Come on, let's go. Come on.

66
00:05:19,568 --> 00:05:21,570
Trail's as plain for you
as it is for me.

67
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,799
- Another fire.
- They ain't making much time.

68
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,342
Must be something
wrong with them.

69
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:45,678
- Looks like a horse fell there.
- Yeah.

70
00:05:52,059 --> 00:05:54,270
- Well, it's no use guessing.
- Ahhh...

71
00:06:17,084 --> 00:06:18,752
- Look out, rocks!
- Ride!

72
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,613
Well, I guess that's
the end of it.

73
00:06:28,637 --> 00:06:31,307
Yeah, if it was
a natural slide.

74
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,647
Look out! Look out!

75
00:07:43,003 --> 00:07:44,964
Well, you found him.

76
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,799
Uh, he's got to come
down sometime.

77
00:07:46,882 --> 00:07:48,509
Yeah, but when?
A day, a week.

78
00:07:48,592 --> 00:07:50,272
And the chance is
he sneaks down some night

79
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,470
and gets us.

80
00:07:51,553 --> 00:07:53,305
We'll take turn on watch.

81
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:56,976
Having it out with this fellow
ain't my job, not for no $20.

82
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:59,103
You've got him,
but he got you too.

83
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:03,232
Unless there's another
way up there.

84
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:06,819
You're crazy!
You can't get up there!

85
00:08:06,902 --> 00:08:08,362
Go up the trail
and get some cover

86
00:08:08,445 --> 00:08:09,923
and take a shot at him
every once in a while,

87
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:12,074
and make him think
we're stuck down here.

88
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,158
Ain't we?

89
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,621
Come on.

90
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,962
Hold it!

91
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,843
- What's the trouble?
- Get down.

92
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,199
I heard some shooting
and came to look.

93
00:08:36,223 --> 00:08:37,307
Who are you?

94
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:41,311
Oh, that's the way it is?

95
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,605
Lieutenant Roy Anderson,
sixth Cavalry.

96
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:45,190
Indian fighter extraordinary.

97
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,609
You're a long way
from an army post, lieutenant.

98
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,403
I quit playing soldier
last week.

99
00:08:49,486 --> 00:08:52,031
Let's see your discharge.

100
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,992
I'm riding east, from Fort
Ellis. What's wrong with that?

101
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:57,786
Nothing, except the Bozeman
trail runs east from Ellis.

102
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,538
How come you're
this far off it?

103
00:08:59,621 --> 00:09:01,307
Well, you see, there's some
bad-tempered Indians

104
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:03,250
along the Bozeman trail and...

105
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,293
seems this chief's daughter
fell into some trouble

106
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:08,297
with a handsome,
young army lieutenant, and...

107
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,715
Well, you know how it is.

108
00:09:18,932 --> 00:09:20,642
The army never
did understand me.

109
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:22,477
Yeah.

110
00:09:23,687 --> 00:09:25,022
Hey, how about these?

111
00:09:25,105 --> 00:09:26,690
Alright, give him back his gun.

112
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,735
Come on.

113
00:09:29,818 --> 00:09:31,195
Oh, you never did tell me

114
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,697
what the shooting was about.

115
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:35,741
I don't even know
who I'm talking to.

116
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:38,786
This here is Mr. Kemp.
My name is Tate, Jesse Tate.

117
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,121
You don't say?

118
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,915
We've got an outlaw killer
trapped up there

119
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:46,043
starting rockslides
every time we show our heads.

120
00:09:46,126 --> 00:09:48,962
An outlaw killer
throwing rocks?

121
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,006
- That sounds real desperate.
- Come on.

122
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,592
Show him the picture, Mr. Kemp.

123
00:09:53,675 --> 00:09:55,052
Come on, show me.

124
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,482
You followed him
all the way from Kansas?

125
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,651
He did. I joined up
with him this morning.

126
00:10:10,734 --> 00:10:12,736
Sort of helping out.
Like a deputy.

127
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,282
Looks like you got
yourself a real

128
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,243
interesting problem
in tactics, sheriff.

129
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:21,954
Yeah. Come on up the trail.

130
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:25,541
Crazy, ain't it, Pokey,
what one man

131
00:10:25,624 --> 00:10:27,501
will do to catch another?

132
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:30,129
Now, if it was gold up there,
instead of this outlaw,

133
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,672
I'd put my carcass to climbing

134
00:10:31,755 --> 00:10:33,423
that cliff and never
think twice.

135
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,633
Hey, come on.

136
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,370
I thought you said
you were going some place?

137
00:11:27,394 --> 00:11:29,034
Oh, don't mind me,
I won't get in the way.

138
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:52,562
I'll be right here
behind you, sheriff,

139
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:54,463
in case the bad man
sticks his head out.

140
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,210
Wonder if I can make it.

141
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,219
- Now, what do you want here?
- Just offering my help.

142
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:45,013
- Why?
- Why are you turning it down?

143
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,099
If I burn my hands,
I'll let you try it again.

144
00:12:49,893 --> 00:12:51,979
Now, stand by with your gun.
I did as much for you.

145
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:51,890
Now, ain't that the way?

146
00:14:54,017 --> 00:14:55,644
A man gets set for trouble
head-on,

147
00:14:55,727 --> 00:14:58,605
and it sneaks up behind him
every time.

148
00:14:58,688 --> 00:14:59,856
That's life.

149
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,067
Get up.

150
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,158
Open your gun belt
and let it fall.

151
00:15:11,618 --> 00:15:13,120
No need to fuss there, soldier.

152
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,706
I've been out of cartridges
since Abilene.

153
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,418
You can see.

154
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,130
Now why don't you just
do what I say?

155
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,100
Hey, you two!
It's all over!

156
00:15:35,183 --> 00:15:36,518
Get him, Ben!

157
00:16:34,117 --> 00:16:37,287
Alright, Ben.
Tie him up!

158
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,748
Let me go, let me alone!
Let me alone!

159
00:16:39,831 --> 00:16:41,911
Calm down, sweetheart,
we're not gonna hang you.

160
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,380
I ain't fighting you
no more, Howie.

161
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,344
- Not the three of you, I ain't.
- Who's she?

162
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:54,721
You remember old Frank Patch,
don't you, Howie?

163
00:16:56,389 --> 00:16:57,849
This here is his daughter, Lina.

164
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,893
I remember an outlaw,
name of Patch,

165
00:16:59,976 --> 00:17:02,020
lying dead in front
of a bank in Abilene.

166
00:17:02,103 --> 00:17:04,481
I don't remember
any talk about kinfolk.

167
00:17:04,564 --> 00:17:05,815
He was my father.

168
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,859
What's she doing
here with you?

169
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,945
I guess she don't know
nobody but me.

170
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,241
And I didn't figure on seeing
Kansas again.

171
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:15,659
Till now I didn't.

172
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:18,078
Alright, get up.
Come on, get up!

173
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:21,498
Here you are, Tate.
That settles us.

174
00:17:21,581 --> 00:17:23,542
- I'm much obliged to you.
- Thanks.

175
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,545
Say, Mr. Kemp, now you've got
two of them to handle,

176
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,005
maybe you still have a mind
to hire up help.

177
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,799
This is my job, I'll do it.

178
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,259
Make you feel any better,
sheriff,

179
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,762
you can make me deputy,
official-like.

180
00:17:35,845 --> 00:17:37,305
You ain't letting
on like you was

181
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,182
a sheriff or something,
are you, Howie?

182
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,977
Why, sure he is. Ain't he?

183
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,271
He told me he was
a peace officer.

184
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,523
I don't know
why you should do that.

185
00:17:46,606 --> 00:17:48,406
No matter who gets me,
the reward still holds.

186
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:50,151
How's that?

187
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:52,279
Ain't you showed him
my picture, Howie?

188
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,989
I seen a paper saying
he was wanted,

189
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,448
nothing about no reward.

190
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,617
Maybe he ain't got a good copy
like I have.

191
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,877
- Is that what he showed you?
- How much?

192
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:12,257
Says $5,000. Why, you talk like
you knowed it all along.

193
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,718
Why else would a man
tear off the bottom of a poster?

194
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,472
I'm taking him back
and I'm gonna do it alone.

195
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,434
You didn't catch him alone.

196
00:18:22,517 --> 00:18:24,811
You was goin' round and round
until you run into me.

197
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:28,148
You were hired to do a job
and you were paid for it.

198
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:31,818
You ain't gonna buy
my claim on this for no $20.

199
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:35,030
What about him?
He done the climbing, didn't he?

200
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:36,323
Could have gotten killed, too.

201
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,828
Tell you what,
I'll settle for a third.

202
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,914
How about you, Jesse?
Share and share alike?

203
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,374
That's the way it is.

204
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,335
Unless you're of
a mind to kill us all.

205
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:54,799
Looks like you got yourself
a couple of partners, Howie.

206
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,218
Ahh. Quit acting like we
was friends! You...

207
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:01,139
Maybe we sat down at the same
card game once or twice

208
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,266
but that don't mean
dirt to me now.

209
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:05,685
You shot a man in the back

210
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,854
and I'm taking you in
to hang for it.

211
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,898
It wasn't Ben
that killed that man.

212
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:12,067
It's him they're paying
the reward on.

213
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:15,403
- Now, where are your horses?
- Back at the rocks.

214
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:18,531
Lina's horse has got a bellyful
of disease. He can't travel.

215
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,284
He can't, huh? Alright,
come on, let's go. Come on.

216
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,919
Easy, boy, easy.

217
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:32,295
Easy there, boy.

218
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:35,924
Alright, watch him.

219
00:19:36,716 --> 00:19:38,301
Easy, boy, easy.

220
00:19:40,595 --> 00:19:44,015
He's really sick, mister,
that's why we held up here.

221
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:46,059
Must have took bad
water some place.

222
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:47,870
I rode him two days like this
when he should have

223
00:19:47,894 --> 00:19:49,104
rested and throwed it off.

224
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:53,191
Easy, boy. Easy.

225
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:00,198
What are you gonna do, mister?

226
00:20:00,281 --> 00:20:02,617
Oh, that horse is suffering,
he can't hardly breathe.

227
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:08,873
You've seen sicker horses
than this, ain't you, mister?

228
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,126
He's pretty bad, girlie.

229
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:12,961
No sense in shooting
a good horse

230
00:20:13,044 --> 00:20:14,671
just to hang me a day sooner.

231
00:20:14,754 --> 00:20:15,922
You keep out of this.

232
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:17,233
Besides, if we ain't
to the big river

233
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,550
before the rains,

234
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:19,652
it's another week downstream

235
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:22,303
to find a crossing.

236
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,097
Nobody's gonna touch my horse.

237
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,890
Nobody is.
Nobody is gonna touch my...

238
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,535
Come on, girlie, you don't
want to leave him

239
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,519
for some cat or bear
to rip open.

240
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:32,772
No, I'm not gonna go, no...

241
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,566
Let me.

242
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:36,568
Well, there's no reward
for killing my horse!

243
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
Ben, don't let them
kill my horse.

244
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,658
Don't let them kill my horse!

245
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,660
Listen to me! Listen to me!

246
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,538
That horse wouldn't have
lasted the night, anyway.

247
00:20:48,621 --> 00:20:51,666
Forget about him. Start worrying
about me swinging from a rope.

248
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,209
- You want that?
- No.

249
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,712
I need time.
You understand, Lina?

250
00:20:55,795 --> 00:20:58,465
Time. And you've
gotta help me.

251
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,843
I've already scratched open
a sore spot over that reward.

252
00:21:01,926 --> 00:21:04,971
The longer we ride,
the more things that can happen.

253
00:21:05,054 --> 00:21:07,474
That's the fight.
Are you listening?

254
00:21:09,184 --> 00:21:10,435
Listen to me.

255
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,192
I heard you, Ben.

256
00:21:19,402 --> 00:21:20,695
I heard you.

257
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,532
Alright, come on.

258
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:53,311
Move, you lop-eared
cactus-eater!

259
00:21:53,394 --> 00:21:54,729
Quit dragging your feet.

260
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,564
Pokey don't like it
no more than you do.

261
00:22:00,735 --> 00:22:03,446
Honey, first thing I'm gonna get
you out of that reward money

262
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,533
is the biggest steak in Kansas,
for that cheek.

263
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,776
Oh, you're not gonna be mad at
me all the way, are you?

264
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,538
Come on, I'll make it up to you.

265
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,831
What're you doing tonight?

266
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,796
You're having quite a time,
aren't you?

267
00:22:19,879 --> 00:22:22,173
Ahh, come on, loosen up.
Spring is here.

268
00:22:22,257 --> 00:22:25,260
It's gonna be a long,
lonely ride to Abilene.

269
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:28,471
And being as Jesse's too old,
I'll toss you for her.

270
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,223
Right now, she's probably
telling Ben

271
00:22:30,306 --> 00:22:32,809
how to cut your throat.

272
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:34,812
You don't think that pretty
little thing would...

273
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,689
Hey, you two,
break it up there!

274
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,686
Here, try it with this.

275
00:23:18,521 --> 00:23:20,815
Come on, don't be stubborn.
Press it against your face.

276
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,817
- Get away from me.
- Like it better this way?

277
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,278
Let me go, let me alone!

278
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:31,534
If she bothers you so much,
why don't you tie her up

279
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:32,911
and be done with her?

280
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,538
No bother.
I like to wrestle with her.

281
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:38,541
You're a big man
for beating up women, ain't you?

282
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,667
And you're no better.

283
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,669
Lina.

284
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,848
That jackass started a misery
in my back.

285
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,141
Can you do me?

286
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,898
Don't get them fired up
all the time.

287
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:03,983
Best thing on our side
is your pretty face.

288
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,070
They're men, honey,
and you ain't.

289
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:08,380
- Remember that.
- I'm not gonna...

290
00:24:08,404 --> 00:24:10,782
I ain't asking you
to marry them.

291
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:13,242
The more they look at you, the
less they'll be seeing of me.

292
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,626
You sure got her trained, Ben.

293
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:23,628
Tell you, if I was
to have a daughter,

294
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:26,589
I wouldn't want her no different
than Lina here.

295
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,384
Except she shouldn't have
such sharp nails.

296
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,637
- Maybe not so much temper.
- Hold still!

297
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,764
Honey, you remember those
cigars I got put away?

298
00:24:34,847 --> 00:24:36,057
I could do with one now.

299
00:24:36,891 --> 00:24:38,476
Get two.

300
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:39,852
I don't smoke.

301
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,273
Any more at home like her?

302
00:24:46,734 --> 00:24:48,945
She got no home,
that's the trouble.

303
00:24:49,028 --> 00:24:51,155
Ma died in Paso a couple
of months ago

304
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,241
and she come up north
hunting her pa.

305
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:55,243
He was dead and planted
when she got here.

306
00:24:55,326 --> 00:24:58,538
So, of course, you felt obliged
to look out for her.

307
00:24:58,621 --> 00:25:00,915
Son, her pa was
my best friend.

308
00:25:10,466 --> 00:25:14,303
Hey, Jesse! Why don't you get
a pan and do it right?

309
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,098
- What do you know about gold?
- Just what I heard.

310
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:18,474
Come on, let's get riding.

311
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,435
What's the crazy hurry?
We can camp here.

312
00:25:20,518 --> 00:25:22,228
That's right, Howie,
a day more or less

313
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:25,064
won't change the price on me.

314
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:28,443
Of course, it might give one of
you boys time to think.

315
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,069
Plain arithmetic.

316
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,948
Money splits better two ways
instead of three.

317
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,502
Come on.

318
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,937
Hiyah! Hiyah! Hiyah!

319
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,647
Hiyah! Hiyah!

320
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:40,389
How can you breathe
that stinking rope?

321
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,517
Kills the taste
of your cooking, Jesse.

322
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,855
Nothing like a good woman
to stir a pot.

323
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,483
Nothing like a good woman.

324
00:26:50,566 --> 00:26:52,276
I guess you've got
the years to know

325
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,404
better than any of us, Jesse.
Did you ever marry one of them?

326
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:57,657
Never had to,
with my good looks.

327
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:02,120
No sense in asking Roy
here about women.

328
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,372
He'd keep us up all night.

329
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,666
Well, right now,
I'm sort of in between.

330
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:10,753
Well, looks like we're
a herd of bachelors.

331
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,048
Even Kemp.

332
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,217
Never should have
marched off to war, Howie.

333
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,803
Should have stayed home
and married the girl.

334
00:27:18,886 --> 00:27:20,680
Of course, it's none
of my business.

335
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:23,474
That's right, it's none
of your business.

336
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:25,226
Come on, let's get
this stuff cleaned up.

337
00:27:25,309 --> 00:27:27,061
Alright, girlie,
grab a handful.

338
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,771
I'll do mine and Ben's.

339
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:31,816
You'll do what I tell you,
that's what you'll do.

340
00:27:31,899 --> 00:27:32,900
Women.

341
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,281
I think I'll go along,
to protect her.

342
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,206
Sure works on me.

343
00:27:48,332 --> 00:27:50,251
The way his eyes hang on her.

344
00:27:50,334 --> 00:27:52,628
Fancy-talking Eastern boy.

345
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,338
Trouble is, talk's
just the beginning

346
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,674
with wild kids like that.
You watch.

347
00:27:56,757 --> 00:27:58,968
When he's ready,
he'll reach out and take.

348
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:00,219
And who's to stop him?

349
00:28:06,809 --> 00:28:09,604
Di... did you think
I was gonna jump you?

350
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,772
- That's right.
- No.

351
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,984
No, I was... just uncramping.

352
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,113
You look almost
sorry I didn't.

353
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,283
Yeah, killing me
in self-defense

354
00:28:22,366 --> 00:28:24,452
is a lot better than
killing me for money.

355
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:27,330
Well, it's your choice, Ben.

356
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,918
A bullet right here on the trail
or a rope in Abilene.

357
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:36,505
Choosing the way to die,
what's the difference?

358
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,885
Choosing the way to live,
that's the hard part.

359
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,906
That's what's eating you,
ain't it, Howie?

360
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,181
There's nothing eating me!

361
00:28:45,264 --> 00:28:46,933
Somebody was bound
to collect on you.

362
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,936
Maybe.

363
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,772
I calculated some
horse-thieving scum

364
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:56,567
would want the price on my hide,
but not you, Howie...

365
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,818
Now, why don't you shut up?

366
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,779
Not a man of your leanings.

367
00:28:59,862 --> 00:29:02,615
Not a ranching man.

368
00:29:02,698 --> 00:29:04,825
I don't deny you got
a dirty deal, but...

369
00:29:08,454 --> 00:29:10,915
The things a gal
can do to a man.

370
00:29:10,998 --> 00:29:12,208
Ohhh. Shut up!

371
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,563
Hold it up here!

372
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,569
Might save a day if we went
over instead of around.

373
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,239
A day might make
the difference.

374
00:29:43,322 --> 00:29:45,700
Better take a look first
and find some kind of trail.

375
00:29:45,783 --> 00:29:47,368
Wait, I got some glasses.

376
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,212
I knew you had your nuggets
hid somewhere under me.

377
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,576
I wouldn't be
putting up with you

378
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:01,090
if I had nuggets
to take back.

379
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:02,174
Let me get in there.

380
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:07,054
Funny you ain't had no luck
in this country.

381
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,307
A fellow I know
struck gold just north of here.

382
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,143
Half a mountain of it, almost.

383
00:30:12,226 --> 00:30:15,438
- What fellow was that?
- A fellow I know.

384
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:18,024
Only thing, he had more trouble
getting it out of the ground

385
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,776
than he had finding it,
that's what I hear.

386
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,860
He don't know much.

387
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:24,864
Got them from an officer fellow.

388
00:30:24,947 --> 00:30:27,325
Swapped him even
for a Paiute tomahawk.

389
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,368
It weren't really Paiute,
I made it myself.

390
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,622
I had you figured
for a horse trader.

391
00:30:39,086 --> 00:30:40,671
Jesse!

392
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,922
Keep your eye on "em, Roy.

393
00:30:49,221 --> 00:30:50,973
Mind if I get off
and stand a while?

394
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,100
Go ahead.

395
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,313
You can, too.

396
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:04,653
They gone up higher
to look ahead?

397
00:31:07,907 --> 00:31:10,326
Well, if a man could do that
with his own life.

398
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,081
Maybe if I'd seen what was ahead
when I was younger,

399
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,749
I wouldn't be in this fix.

400
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:19,668
Ahh, of course I would.

401
00:31:22,004 --> 00:31:23,464
Some of the things...

402
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,341
Nope.

403
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,888
Nope, I wouldn't have done
nothing no different.

404
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:36,727
Except for you, honey.

405
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:40,314
I wouldn't have
dragged you with me.

406
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,526
You didn't drag me, Ben.

407
00:31:43,609 --> 00:31:45,545
I wish there was some way
to protect you from Howie.

408
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,780
He's gonna start on
you pretty soon.

409
00:31:47,863 --> 00:31:49,490
Kemp?

410
00:31:49,573 --> 00:31:52,243
I've seen him with women.

411
00:31:52,326 --> 00:31:53,661
He'll look and think...

412
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:57,123
and then he'll
reach out and take.

413
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:58,725
And the way things are,
who's gonna stop him?

414
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,668
- Me.
- You better.

415
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,171
I'm the jealous type.

416
00:32:11,178 --> 00:32:13,931
Ah! It's not
much of a trail.

417
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:16,517
I think we can make it
right through that pass.

418
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,060
At least the pay is good.

419
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,233
Give me those glasses.

420
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,364
What do you make of it?

421
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,574
Indians.

422
00:32:31,657 --> 00:32:34,452
Two, four, six, seven, eight...

423
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,579
- About 12 of them.
- Are they wearing paint?

424
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:37,872
It's hard to tell.

425
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,291
Right up there.

426
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:45,004
Yeah, they're
just Blackfeet.

427
00:32:45,087 --> 00:32:47,882
Nothing to worry about. Been no
trouble with them for years.

428
00:32:47,965 --> 00:32:50,176
A little far south
for Blackfeet, aren't we?

429
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,428
- Hunting party, I guess.
- Uh-huh.

430
00:32:53,387 --> 00:32:54,638
Hunting what?

431
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:19,038
Alright, mount up.
We're going over.

432
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,708
Oh yeah, and don't
get nervous if we see

433
00:33:22,791 --> 00:33:24,668
a couple of Indians
coming up behind.

434
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,545
- Indians?
- Don't worry. Don't worry, now.

435
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:27,838
They're just Blackfeet.

436
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,798
Take it easy
on the trail up there.

437
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,026
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?

438
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,718
You want to get us all scalped?

439
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:35,095
We got nothing they want.
Isn't that right, Jesse?

440
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,681
- Yup.
- Indians are Indians.

441
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,242
We can cover this trail
and finish them off

442
00:33:39,266 --> 00:33:40,476
when they come through.

443
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,719
Why look for trouble?

444
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:48,025
What's the matter, lieutenant?

445
00:33:48,108 --> 00:33:50,110
Alright, if you want to know,
they're after me.

446
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,194
They've been hunting me
ever since I left the fort.

447
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,575
Now that's something else again.

448
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,495
This chief's daughter
you was holding hands with,

449
00:33:59,578 --> 00:34:01,247
was she willing?

450
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,666
Never mind the sermon.
We've got a fight on our hands.

451
00:34:03,749 --> 00:34:05,793
This is your
fight, not ours.

452
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,545
You expect me
to take them alone?

453
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,296
They don't
just kill a man.

454
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,216
He's right. If them Indians
are out to revenge a squaw,

455
00:34:12,299 --> 00:34:14,009
they'll make him holler first.

456
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,679
Do the same thing to us
if we're with him.

457
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,722
Maybe worse.

458
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,600
Alright, you better start riding
the skin off that horse of yours

459
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,394
if you want to stay
out ahead of them.

460
00:34:25,145 --> 00:34:26,730
The reward cuts
bigger two ways, huh?

461
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,024
You're losing time.

462
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,621
Alright, now keep close
together. You ride next to Ben.

463
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,123
Come on.

464
00:36:41,448 --> 00:36:42,658
Now just sit easy.

465
00:37:11,478 --> 00:37:13,063
- Get behind that stump.
- Right.

466
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:54,021
Get down!

467
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:34,830
Anybody got a match?

468
00:39:34,913 --> 00:39:36,540
You could have
got us all killed.

469
00:39:36,623 --> 00:39:37,916
It worked, didn't it?

470
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,819
Did you think I was
gonna let those Indians

471
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,428
ride me into the ground?

472
00:39:49,511 --> 00:39:51,889
Let them peel my hide
over a slow-burning fire?

473
00:39:53,056 --> 00:39:54,516
Oh, no.

474
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,728
Not me... partners.

475
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,445
Come on, mount up.

476
00:40:06,528 --> 00:40:08,155
You can't sit a horse
with a slug

477
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:09,406
in your leg, Howie.

478
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:10,991
You get on that burro.

479
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:15,245
Come on.

480
00:41:50,215 --> 00:41:52,009
He's done a day's work.

481
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,301
Fix a fire.

482
00:42:04,604 --> 00:42:05,897
Where are they?

483
00:42:06,648 --> 00:42:07,983
Where are they?

484
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:09,359
Where'd they take her?

485
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:11,153
Where'd they take her?
Let go now.

486
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:12,362
Get your hands off.

487
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,989
Get your hands off me.

488
00:42:14,072 --> 00:42:15,198
I've got to find her.

489
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,282
I got to.

490
00:42:16,324 --> 00:42:17,951
I got to... I got to find her.

491
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,078
- I've got to...
- He been like this long?

492
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,455
Not as bad.

493
00:42:29,504 --> 00:42:31,339
What are you trying to do,
drown him?

494
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:32,966
Here, give me that handkerchief.

495
00:42:38,638 --> 00:42:41,850
Mary, Mary, Mary...

496
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,148
Mary.

497
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,318
Don't worry.

498
00:42:51,401 --> 00:42:54,321
The war won't last a year.
I'll be home before you know it.

499
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,468
No sense getting married,
and then having to say goodbye.

500
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,701
You understand that.

501
00:43:01,953 --> 00:43:03,997
Sure, I understand.

502
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,666
Now, get some sleep.

503
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,836
You can manage, Mary. The boys
will take care of the stock.

504
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,798
When I get back, it'll be just
like we talked about last night.

505
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,426
You understand, Mary?

506
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:17,844
You remember what you said?

507
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:20,639
I remember.

508
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:23,391
I said, "I'll wait for you."

509
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:33,026
He got what was coming to him.

510
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,112
Half of Abilene knows about it.

511
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,114
I've heard of some big suckers
in my time but...

512
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,865
This ain't our affair.

513
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,492
You know what he done?

514
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:42,494
When he marched off
to preserve the Union

515
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:46,081
he signed over his ranch to this
gal, so she could work it legal.

516
00:43:46,164 --> 00:43:47,749
Guess what?

517
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,085
Come back to find out
she'd sold it.

518
00:43:50,168 --> 00:43:52,629
Used the money to run off
with another fellow.

519
00:43:52,712 --> 00:43:54,089
It's nothing to laugh at.

520
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,218
No? Well, laugh at this then.

521
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:00,137
What am I supposed to do? Cry?

522
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,513
Feel sorry for him?

523
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,826
I got nothing against
these fellows.

524
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,643
They just happened along.

525
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:08,603
But him...

526
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:12,399
I never hurt him no wise,
and he starts out to hunt me

527
00:44:12,482 --> 00:44:15,152
days, weeks, like an animal.

528
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:16,862
That's enough.

529
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,405
This ain't none of our business.

530
00:44:19,906 --> 00:44:21,533
He wants his land back.

531
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:24,661
And I'll tell you something.

532
00:44:24,744 --> 00:44:27,289
His end of the reward
ain't enough to buy it.

533
00:44:27,372 --> 00:44:28,707
That's your business.

534
00:44:33,628 --> 00:44:35,130
I think I'll make some coffee.

535
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,551
Then why did he make a deal
with us, to begin with?

536
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,263
Howie's a practical man.

537
00:44:43,346 --> 00:44:46,057
He needed you fellas' help to
get through this rough country.

538
00:44:47,225 --> 00:44:49,311
But the closer we get to Abilene

539
00:44:49,394 --> 00:44:51,104
the more you've got to worry.

540
00:45:06,953 --> 00:45:09,164
Give me my choice,
and I'll take hand-panning

541
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,583
in running water, naturally.

542
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:15,212
Especially when you're working
alone like I do.

543
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,380
Of course, when you get a strike
in high country

544
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:20,050
like here for instance...

545
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:21,676
your big problem
is getting the water

546
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,386
to where you're digging.

547
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,556
Yeah, that's the trouble
my friend had.

548
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,684
Ground full of gold
and no water to work it. Hey!

549
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,019
Now maybe you'll shut up.

550
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:34,689
I've been meaning to ask...

551
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,209
you talk like you've seen
this fellow's

552
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:38,193
mine with your own eyes.

553
00:45:38,276 --> 00:45:39,736
I just heard.

554
00:45:39,819 --> 00:45:42,113
Never hit it, huh, Jesse?

555
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,699
Nothing worth the mention.

556
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,826
Seems I've been looking
all my life.

557
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,246
All my life.

558
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:52,707
That's a long time to look
for something.

559
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,585
Maybe you've been looking
in the wrong places.

560
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,880
Fellow says, "There's gold in
the valley,” I go to the valley.

561
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:01,675
Fellow says, "Dig here,” I dig.

562
00:46:01,758 --> 00:46:05,345
Fellow says, "There's a rush
on to the north,” I go north.

563
00:46:05,428 --> 00:46:08,431
In '49, I run to California.

564
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,934
Still remember,
spent good money for maps.

565
00:46:11,017 --> 00:46:13,228
Even made my own maps.

566
00:46:13,311 --> 00:46:15,313
I've seen fellows
too drunk to walk

567
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,899
fall on their face
and find gold.

568
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,109
But never me.

569
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,445
Hey, Jesse!

570
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,950
Where's Roy?

571
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:30,161
He rode off before dawn.
Didn't say where.

572
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:32,289
That's enough shaving.
Give me that.

573
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,542
Drop it there.

574
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:45,969
Well, you slept yourself out.

575
00:46:46,052 --> 00:46:47,971
Must be halfway to noon almost.

576
00:46:48,054 --> 00:46:49,431
Why didn't somebody wake me?

577
00:46:49,514 --> 00:46:51,391
What's everybody lying
around for?

578
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,312
That tells you, better than me.

579
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,025
You get him some breakfast.

580
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:02,360
You can change
the wrapping, girlie.

581
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,362
- Why me?
- Because I say so.

582
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,905
Don't fuss all the time!

583
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,949
Hold on, Jesse.

584
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,327
This girl's been up half
the night taking care of him.

585
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,078
She's wore out.

586
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,580
Never mind, Ben.

587
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:18,752
- Hey, I'll do it.
- Lay still.

588
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,378
- No, you don't have to.
- I'll do it.

589
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,844
- You sat up with me?
- Yeah.

590
00:47:27,927 --> 00:47:29,554
- Why?
- Somebody had to.

591
00:47:29,637 --> 00:47:31,973
You was raving,
so no one could sleep.

592
00:47:32,057 --> 00:47:33,975
- Why should you care?
- I don't.

593
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,828
I'd have done it for a dog
if he was suffering.

594
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,187
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

595
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:42,734
You said I was raving.
What about?

596
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,112
Nothing that made sense.

597
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,491
You thought I was your girl.
You kept calling me Mary.

598
00:47:49,574 --> 00:47:51,159
You were really out
of your head.

599
00:47:51,242 --> 00:47:53,453
We ain't nothing alike,
Mary and me.

600
00:47:53,536 --> 00:47:54,954
At least, that's what Ben says.

601
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,718
Well, Ben's just like all
the rest of them.

602
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,559
- He never even met her.
- Well, he knows what she did.

603
00:47:58,583 --> 00:47:59,918
What she did is her business.

604
00:48:00,001 --> 00:48:01,354
She had no business
selling your ranch.

605
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,587
Alright, you're different.

606
00:48:02,670 --> 00:48:03,689
You would have done
it different.

607
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,131
Let's let it go.

608
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,053
How do you mean I'm different?

609
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:13,723
I mean you got a man.

610
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,308
At least you stick to him.

611
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,161
- He's not my man.
- You're with him, ain't you?

612
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:18,895
- Not like you mean.
- Alright, forget it.

613
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,237
What are you doing
with Ben, anyway?

614
00:48:29,155 --> 00:48:31,491
Did you expect to run
and hide forever?

615
00:48:31,574 --> 00:48:33,576
Ben was taking me to California.

616
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:34,911
He was gonna start new.

617
00:48:34,994 --> 00:48:36,538
Start new? At what?

618
00:48:37,705 --> 00:48:39,040
Ranching, maybe.

619
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,667
He knows a lot about cattle.

620
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,836
Yeah, other people's cattle.

621
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,340
Did you ever think for a minute
that Ben had the temper

622
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:49,717
to settle on the land?

623
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,178
To clear it, to build on it?

624
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,931
To bring in the cattle and...

625
00:48:55,014 --> 00:48:56,307
nurse them through the winter

626
00:48:56,391 --> 00:49:00,270
and round up strays,

627
00:49:00,353 --> 00:49:03,481
brand calves?

628
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:06,526
Start new? The only thing
Ben'll start is trouble.

629
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,155
He's wild, sure.

630
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,073
Like my father used to be.

631
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:13,592
But they didn't do
one of the ten things

632
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:14,736
that people blamed them for.

633
00:49:14,784 --> 00:49:15,952
He's mean.
He was born mean...

634
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:17,620
Ben took me
for my father's sake

635
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:18,764
when there was no cause
for him to,

636
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:20,123
and he's treated me decent.

637
00:49:20,206 --> 00:49:21,767
Well, that's more than he's done
for most people.

638
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,686
I've never seen him hurt no one,
except in a fair fight.

639
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,590
- Sure, I know, sure.
- And who are you to talk?

640
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:27,356
You didn't track him all this
way just "cause he's mean.

641
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,048
I never said I did.

642
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,277
There's a lot of outlaws riding
free with no one after them.

643
00:49:31,301 --> 00:49:32,486
Ben could've killed a dozen men

644
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:34,053
and you wouldn't
have looked twice

645
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:35,889
if it wasn't for the reward.

646
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:48,485
Where have you been?

647
00:49:51,946 --> 00:49:53,907
- How's the leg?
- Here you are.

648
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,283
Breakfast in bed.

649
00:49:58,661 --> 00:49:59,954
What's this?

650
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,123
You better eat it
before we tell you.

651
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,626
I made a map of the trail ahead.
Here, take a look.

652
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:05,877
I know the way.

653
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:10,256
Hey, look.

654
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,925
Here's this pony-backed ridge

655
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:14,302
marked along this
stretch of trees.

656
00:50:14,385 --> 00:50:16,930
You follow these mountains
right down to the big river

657
00:50:17,013 --> 00:50:18,723
and we'll meet
on the other side.

658
00:50:18,806 --> 00:50:20,975
Meet who?

659
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,977
Well, what he means,
all of you go on ahead

660
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:25,146
and I use this map
to catch up with you later.

661
00:50:27,023 --> 00:50:28,358
That's right, isn't it?

662
00:50:28,441 --> 00:50:30,193
It's the only smart way.

663
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:31,611
Riding alone,
he can make up time

664
00:50:31,694 --> 00:50:33,029
it would take us days to cover.

665
00:50:33,112 --> 00:50:34,280
And the rain's coming.

666
00:50:36,449 --> 00:50:38,034
Well, Jesse, what do you think?

667
00:50:38,117 --> 00:50:39,661
I'm thinking if something
goes wrong

668
00:50:39,744 --> 00:50:41,329
and you don't meet up with us

669
00:50:41,412 --> 00:50:44,457
I stand to gain from it
as much as Roy here.

670
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,209
That's a dirty idea.

671
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:50,088
I ain't much proud of it,
but it's the truth.

672
00:50:50,171 --> 00:50:53,591
It won't be that way with me,
is all I can promise.

673
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:57,470
As soon as we get across, we
wait for you on the other side.

674
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,806
You got Jesse's word
on it, and mine.

675
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,280
Here, this is yours.

676
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:18,324
Come on, let's get the horses
ready. I'm riding with you.

677
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,118
What are you trying to do?
Kill yourself?

678
00:51:20,201 --> 00:51:21,911
I ain't going to cheat you.

679
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:23,264
You know, your trouble
is you just

680
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,914
think of one thing at a time.

681
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:28,084
If this is his plan to get rid
of me, who's next?

682
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,544
Just think that over.

683
00:52:18,259 --> 00:52:20,845
You better let Roy ride
drag. You ain't fit.

684
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,327
You know, Howie

685
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:47,580
I ain't been tied up like this
since I was knee high to spit.

686
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:52,168
The time pa sold
our place in Missouri

687
00:52:52,251 --> 00:52:54,962
and started us out for Texas.

688
00:52:57,590 --> 00:52:59,634
I didn't want to go,
so I run off.

689
00:52:59,717 --> 00:53:02,845
He caught me, tied me up
and throwed me in the wagon.

690
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:07,642
That was a hard winter.

691
00:53:07,725 --> 00:53:10,019
Ma caught the fever
and died on the way.

692
00:53:17,151 --> 00:53:20,029
Pa didn't amount
to much after that.

693
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:23,074
Got gunned down in a saloon
before we ever saw Texas.

694
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:26,703
After that I...

695
00:53:28,329 --> 00:53:30,206
met up with some
wild, young fellows.

696
00:53:32,041 --> 00:53:33,960
You might say I come to no good.

697
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:45,012
Look out!

698
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,278
Come on, you buzzard bait, move.

699
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,963
- Is it time yet?
- Pretty near.

700
00:55:42,046 --> 00:55:43,256
I can't sleep anyway.

701
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:48,469
Might be a cat poking around.
I'll go and see.

702
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:21,729
I better see
what's at the other end.

703
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:30,905
Now, this ain't bad.

704
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:33,074
We could all do with some of
Jesse's coffee.

705
00:57:36,077 --> 00:57:38,245
Hey, Roy...

706
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:40,456
Wet cords are shrinking.
How about it?

707
00:57:40,539 --> 00:57:42,291
I'm not going out
in this weather.

708
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,810
Easy there, girlie,
you'll have it all down on us.

709
00:58:06,857 --> 00:58:08,401
It runs back about 30 yards.

710
00:58:08,484 --> 00:58:09,724
Funnels down to another opening

711
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:10,987
about big enough for a cat

712
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,197
to crawl through. Or him.

713
00:58:15,324 --> 00:58:17,284
Hey, Lina, honey...

714
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:19,787
this weather's creeping
into my bones.

715
00:58:21,122 --> 00:58:22,248
Can you do me?

716
00:58:33,467 --> 00:58:35,636
I wonder if you really need this

717
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,138
or if you just like
to be rubbed.

718
00:58:37,221 --> 00:58:39,515
Same thing.

719
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,309
A man needs what he likes.

720
00:58:51,777 --> 00:58:53,446
Poor old, Howie.

721
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:57,450
That bad leg's
just about got him wore out.

722
00:58:57,533 --> 00:59:00,161
Might not be too sharp
on his watch tonight.

723
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:02,163
Shouldn't have to stand one,
the way he is.

724
00:59:02,246 --> 00:59:03,831
Better for us.

725
00:59:03,914 --> 00:59:05,291
This might be our chance.

726
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,420
He's coming around
on his feeling for you.

727
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,506
If you was to sit up
with him tonight

728
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,425
and tell him the things

729
00:59:14,508 --> 00:59:17,928
that a man likes to know,
you know.

730
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:21,015
It'd only be a minute before I'd
be out of that hole in back.

731
00:59:21,098 --> 00:59:22,576
- But if Kemp finds out...
- Finds out what?

732
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,101
I'll be long gone.

733
00:59:25,644 --> 00:59:27,605
You're not gonna let me down,
are you, honey?

734
00:59:28,981 --> 00:59:30,733
No, Ben,

735
00:59:30,816 --> 00:59:32,359
- Only...
- Only what?

736
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:37,323
- He's got no feeling for me.
- No?

737
00:59:37,406 --> 00:59:39,283
All he cares about
is the reward.

738
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,079
Well, you're right, honey.

739
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:45,956
You're better off out of it.

740
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:51,045
I guess my only hope is
that he'll drop off

741
00:59:51,128 --> 00:59:53,380
at least long enough for me

742
00:59:53,464 --> 00:59:58,511
to pick up a rock
and smash his head in.

743
00:59:58,594 --> 01:00:01,055
I don't want to,
but time's running out.

744
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,560
I can help you, Ben.

745
01:00:07,686 --> 01:00:09,480
The way you said.

746
01:00:09,563 --> 01:00:12,817
- You sure?
- Yeah.

747
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,903
It'll be alright, honey.

748
01:00:15,986 --> 01:00:17,029
It'll be alright.

749
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:20,199
Now, you get some coffee, huh?

750
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:41,614
What's the matter?

751
01:01:41,697 --> 01:01:43,449
Nothing. Restless.

752
01:01:47,703 --> 01:01:49,121
The stuff's been out
long enough.

753
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,581
It can't hurt. It's alright.

754
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,560
It's, uh, making music.

755
01:02:14,146 --> 01:02:16,106
There's a sour one some place.

756
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,529
Roy's.

757
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,344
You know, at that,
it sounds better

758
01:02:27,368 --> 01:02:28,702
than some fiddlers I've heard.

759
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:32,414
Is dancing hard to learn?

760
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,041
No, not the way I do it.

761
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,794
Do you like it?

762
01:02:36,877 --> 01:02:38,754
Yeah, used to.

763
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,926
Sometimes I just like to sit
outside by a window

764
01:02:44,009 --> 01:02:45,135
and listen to the music.

765
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:49,181
Like now.

766
01:02:52,268 --> 01:02:53,894
Did you ever see
Mexican dancing?

767
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:02,111
What are you gonna do
when you get back to Abilene?

768
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,989
Help Ben if I can.

769
01:03:05,072 --> 01:03:07,324
Don't you want anything
for yourself?

770
01:03:10,995 --> 01:03:13,622
Used to think of going
to California.

771
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:14,915
Why California?

772
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:18,794
Some place new...

773
01:03:18,877 --> 01:03:22,131
nobody caring who you are,
or where you come from.

774
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,426
A place you could belong to.

775
01:03:26,802 --> 01:03:29,430
A house, maybe even neighbors.

776
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,393
I had neighbors, you know.

777
01:03:34,476 --> 01:03:37,104
Tom Webster and his missus,
lived right across the river.

778
01:03:38,772 --> 01:03:42,318
Had four sons, each one of them
skinnier than the other.

779
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,194
Always coming over
to lend a hand.

780
01:03:46,363 --> 01:03:48,240
Didn't give you much chance
to get lonesome.

781
01:03:49,950 --> 01:03:52,286
Although the house,
the house ain't much,

782
01:03:52,369 --> 01:03:55,539
but it's just prime
cattle country.

783
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:57,124
And the fella
that owns the ranch now

784
01:03:57,207 --> 01:03:58,625
he's willing to sell.

785
01:04:02,254 --> 01:04:04,757
Maybe...

786
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,301
Maybe you'd like to take a look
at it after I buy it back.

787
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,846
With the money you get for Ben?

788
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:13,140
Oh, that's something else.
I'm talking to you now.

789
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:15,976
Be like stepping on a grave.

790
01:04:17,936 --> 01:04:19,313
You know what I'm asking you?

791
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,444
I can't say how I feel,
the way things are.

792
01:05:35,055 --> 01:05:36,473
Alright, get up.

793
01:05:43,355 --> 01:05:44,815
Come on, come on, get up.

794
01:06:02,207 --> 01:06:04,543
Come on. We're through
fooling with you.

795
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,881
- Quit that!
- "Dead or alive," it says.

796
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:10,632
Stop him!
Ben won't have a chance.

797
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,342
Chance at what? To kill us all?

798
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:17,848
Alright, if that's what you
want, I'll give him a chance.

799
01:06:17,931 --> 01:06:21,643
There. Now, cut him loose.

800
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,145
Don't let him do it.

801
01:06:23,228 --> 01:06:24,480
Cut him loose!

802
01:06:30,194 --> 01:06:31,570
Alright, Ben.

803
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:35,073
It ain't a fair fight, Howie.

804
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,660
My hands ain't fit.

805
01:06:43,040 --> 01:06:45,209
You're ready now, anytime.

806
01:06:45,292 --> 01:06:46,793
Come on, draw.

807
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:05,562
I ain't got a prayer
against you, and you know it.

808
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:08,774
It's your first move.

809
01:07:10,275 --> 01:07:13,320
If you're going
to murder me, Howie

810
01:07:13,403 --> 01:07:15,447
don't try to make it look
like something else.

811
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:19,034
Come on, draw.

812
01:07:23,622 --> 01:07:24,790
Kill him!

813
01:07:40,264 --> 01:07:41,390
Alright.

814
01:07:44,434 --> 01:07:46,520
Leave it be.

815
01:07:46,603 --> 01:07:49,189
It's getting so I don't know
which way to point this no more.

816
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:52,526
How many chances does he get?

817
01:07:52,609 --> 01:07:53,878
Is this part of your
deal with her?

818
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:54,902
- I didn't...
- No, no.

819
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:55,945
You didn't keep me busy

820
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:57,281
while he's making his break.

821
01:07:58,615 --> 01:07:59,950
No, it just happened that way.

822
01:08:02,452 --> 01:08:03,829
It just happened that way.

823
01:08:54,671 --> 01:08:57,549
Well, this is no good.
You got any more shortcuts?

824
01:09:00,218 --> 01:09:01,778
Well, there's no sense
stewing about it.

825
01:09:01,803 --> 01:09:03,513
We got here late and that's it.

826
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:05,867
That's the time you cost us.
If you'd listened to me we cou...

827
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,869
Alright, I'll listen to you now
if you got any ideas

828
01:09:07,893 --> 01:09:09,144
about how to get across here.

829
01:09:09,227 --> 01:09:10,812
No, we can't get across that.

830
01:09:10,896 --> 01:09:12,439
You gotta get downstream a ways.

831
01:09:12,522 --> 01:09:14,816
- How far?
- Oh, four, five days.

832
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,318
If we make time.

833
01:09:16,401 --> 01:09:18,820
We can swim it here,
so let's start now.

834
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,822
I'll take the point
if you're afraid.

835
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:22,783
At least I got the sense
to be afraid.

836
01:09:22,866 --> 01:09:24,368
Besides, what about her?

837
01:09:24,451 --> 01:09:26,536
She wouldn't last two minutes
in that current.

838
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:29,456
You want to go downstream?
Take her with you.

839
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:31,750
What if Ben gets washed away?
Then we got nothing.

840
01:09:33,001 --> 01:09:35,629
I bow to your superior wisdom.

841
01:09:35,712 --> 01:09:37,857
I promise you, Jesse, he'll get
across, one way or the other.

842
01:09:37,881 --> 01:09:39,317
- Hey, wait a minute.
- Hey, you can't do that.

843
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:40,735
I'll try the river,
but not like this.

844
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:43,053
Yes, like this. Why not?

845
01:09:43,136 --> 01:09:45,430
We'll go downstream
before we cross.

846
01:09:48,225 --> 01:09:50,018
Now what are you worried about,
your girl?

847
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,853
Don't tell me you're worried
about him.

848
01:09:56,900 --> 01:09:58,860
Why? It's no different
from the rope in Abilene.

849
01:09:58,944 --> 01:10:00,463
You knew you were gonna
bring him back to die

850
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,823
when you started after him.
You know that now.

851
01:10:02,906 --> 01:10:04,199
That hasn't changed.

852
01:10:04,282 --> 01:10:06,576
He's not a man,
he's a sack of money.

853
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,745
That's why we're all here,
especially you.

854
01:10:08,829 --> 01:10:10,455
Why don't you face up to it?

855
01:12:07,906 --> 01:12:09,616
I don't suppose either
of you object

856
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:11,117
to stopping
the night here.

857
01:12:13,787 --> 01:12:15,205
Ha! I didn't think so.

858
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:20,544
I...

859
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,753
I...

860
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:27,551
Hey, Lina, honey

861
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,010
it's my back again.

862
01:12:30,512 --> 01:12:32,013
Can you do me?

863
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,266
Let me do you this time.

864
01:12:34,349 --> 01:12:36,142
Start fixing for a fire, girlie.

865
01:12:39,354 --> 01:12:40,730
How do you like your rubbing?

866
01:12:40,814 --> 01:12:42,399
Up and down or side to side?

867
01:12:42,482 --> 01:12:45,318
Hey, you don't have to do that.

868
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:46,862
You better look after
your partners.

869
01:12:48,196 --> 01:12:49,990
Partners, huh?

870
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:51,449
If I didn't need a grubstake

871
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:54,327
I'd have walked out
on this deal long ago.

872
01:12:54,411 --> 01:12:56,580
It's too bad.

873
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:58,540
If you'd been lucky
like my friend...

874
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,834
And I've had about enough of
that, too.

875
01:13:00,917 --> 01:13:02,711
You got no friend found gold
around here

876
01:13:02,794 --> 01:13:04,671
you're talking about yourself.

877
01:13:04,754 --> 01:13:07,507
I knowed I shouldn't have shot
off my mouth in front of you.

878
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:10,135
Quit playacting. You wanted me
to know it all along.

879
01:13:12,345 --> 01:13:13,638
So, let's get at it.

880
01:13:16,224 --> 01:13:17,893
You tell me where to dig

881
01:13:17,976 --> 01:13:20,353
and I'll see that your gal
is provided for.

882
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,272
Don't try to horse-trade me,
Jesse.

883
01:13:22,355 --> 01:13:24,774
I ain't gonna tell you where my
gold is, but I'll show you.

884
01:13:27,903 --> 01:13:31,656
I knew that's what you been
scratching for all along.

885
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:34,451
Trouble is, I don't trust you
no more than I trust them.

886
01:13:34,534 --> 01:13:37,245
Well, you don't have
to trust nobody.

887
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,122
Even if you don't fancy
my gold mine

888
01:13:39,205 --> 01:13:41,291
you still got me
all to yourself.

889
01:13:41,374 --> 01:13:43,168
Now, that's saying I trust you.

890
01:13:43,251 --> 01:13:46,463
Say I tell you where my gold is,
you might still turn me in.

891
01:13:46,546 --> 01:13:48,423
If I make a deal, I stick by it.

892
01:13:53,803 --> 01:13:56,181
At least I wouldn't have any
partners to worry about.

893
01:13:56,264 --> 01:13:58,391
- Except me.
- What do you mean, you?

894
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:02,062
If I did it, now just if,
it'd be an even swap.

895
01:14:02,145 --> 01:14:04,022
You go loose,
and I get the gold mine.

896
01:14:04,105 --> 01:14:05,398
Now, that ain't fair, Jesse

897
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:07,150
I got a right to some
of that gold.

898
01:14:07,233 --> 01:14:09,527
Fair or no, its the only deal
I'd make.

899
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:13,740
And it's a poor deal no matter.

900
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:11,172
Same deal.
I'll trade you even up.

901
01:15:11,256 --> 01:15:14,801
Your neck for that gold,
yes or no?

902
01:15:14,884 --> 01:15:17,470
I ain't fixed for bargaining,
Jesse, you know that.

903
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:25,103
Come on then,
I got two horses ready.

904
01:15:25,186 --> 01:15:26,479
I'll get Lina.

905
01:15:26,563 --> 01:15:29,774
No, she ain't part of the deal.

906
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:31,026
She goes with me.

907
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:37,032
If I'm gonna be broke,
I ain't gonna be lonesome.

908
01:15:39,993 --> 01:15:41,703
Get her up, then.

909
01:15:41,786 --> 01:15:43,872
Remember, I'm watching you.

910
01:15:56,092 --> 01:15:58,762
I'll tell you later. Come on.

911
01:16:25,872 --> 01:16:28,208
Snake! Snake! Snake! Snake!

912
01:16:29,459 --> 01:16:30,919
Where? Where?

913
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:35,298
Huh! Whoa! Ben, hey.

914
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:41,221
Fun's over.
Get down off that horse.

915
01:16:42,514 --> 01:16:44,682
I said off, come on, move.

916
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,226
You alright, honey?

917
01:16:46,309 --> 01:16:49,270
You got the gun.
What do you care?

918
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:50,396
You're alright.

919
01:16:51,314 --> 01:16:52,690
Get moving.

920
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:56,152
I got it coming.

921
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:58,905
Do business with the devil
and you'll get it every time.

922
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:01,324
Ain't it the truth?

923
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:03,910
Get going. Lina, honey,
you take the horse.

924
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:12,544
Hold it, Jesse.

925
01:17:16,965 --> 01:17:18,258
You better get going, Ben.

926
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:19,861
The other two will
be along any minute.

927
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:22,720
You mean, we better get going,
don't you, honey?

928
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:25,849
If it suits you,
I'll settle for going.

929
01:17:25,932 --> 01:17:29,686
I don't fancy your friend
with a gun in his hand.

930
01:17:29,769 --> 01:17:33,314
"Course, I don't suppose Ben
would be fool enough to shoot.

931
01:17:33,398 --> 01:17:35,817
It'd be heard 20 mile or more.

932
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,319
Who's talking about shooting?

933
01:17:38,403 --> 01:17:41,281
Leave him with the burro, Ben,
you don't need him. Please.

934
01:17:42,323 --> 01:17:44,492
I'm just thinking that...

935
01:17:44,576 --> 01:17:47,036
from up there,
a man could pick off anything

936
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:48,538
that moves in this clearing.

937
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:52,333
The only trouble is...

938
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,460
there's nothing
to stop a man.

939
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:58,006
Make him hold up for a while.

940
01:17:58,089 --> 01:18:02,260
Ben, I got to talk a different
way now, I know that.

941
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:03,553
But that gold mine still ain't

942
01:18:03,636 --> 01:18:05,805
gonna do you much good.
I'm thinking...

943
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:08,099
Thinking is your weak spot,
Jesse.

944
01:18:11,519 --> 01:18:13,479
Here, Lina, hold the horses.
Leave the burro.

945
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:24,365
Ben! Ben! No!

946
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,331
You had no reason to kill him.
He couldn't hurt you none.

947
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:32,790
Leave him lay like that.

948
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,045
They'll come after you sure now.

949
01:18:37,128 --> 01:18:38,588
That shot will bring them.

950
01:18:38,671 --> 01:18:40,882
- And they'll finish you.
- I figure they'll come.

951
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:43,885
Now get those horses
on the other side of that rock.

952
01:18:43,968 --> 01:18:45,762
Come on, do as I say,
before I have to knock

953
01:18:45,845 --> 01:18:47,138
some sense into you.

954
01:19:23,174 --> 01:19:24,425
Up here.

955
01:19:46,739 --> 01:19:47,865
Get down.

956
01:19:50,660 --> 01:19:53,454
Better not move around
too much up here.

957
01:19:53,538 --> 01:19:55,164
Come on, you too.

958
01:19:58,209 --> 01:20:01,296
I swear, he ain't half as
worried over it as you are.

959
01:20:01,379 --> 01:20:02,547
Look at him.

960
01:20:06,050 --> 01:20:07,802
Lying there peaceful in the sun.

961
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,514
He ain't never gonna
be hungry again.

962
01:20:11,597 --> 01:20:13,975
Never want anything
he can't have.

963
01:20:14,058 --> 01:20:15,310
That's more than we can say.

964
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:21,816
Hold still. Hold still.

965
01:20:21,899 --> 01:20:23,568
You're gonna be still
from now on.

966
01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:25,611
I ain't been harder on you
'cause I know you never

967
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:27,280
seen a man killed close up.

968
01:20:27,363 --> 01:20:28,865
Well, that'll pass.

969
01:20:28,948 --> 01:20:30,134
Day after tomorrow,
it'll be just

970
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:31,617
like a story you once heard.

971
01:20:31,701 --> 01:20:34,829
You killed that man
in Abilene like Kemp said!

972
01:20:34,912 --> 01:20:38,041
Just another gun I'll never have
to look into, you understand?

973
01:20:38,124 --> 01:20:41,419
Pretty soon, Roy and your
friend Howie are gonna show up.

974
01:20:41,502 --> 01:20:45,256
Then I'll get me some more
insurance against dying young.

975
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,134
Ben, we can get away.
California. We can go there.

976
01:20:48,217 --> 01:20:49,862
You always said you'd
take me to California.

977
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:51,512
Might go to California.

978
01:20:51,596 --> 01:20:53,532
Kemp didn't kill you when
he had the chance, remember?

979
01:20:53,556 --> 01:20:54,682
You got to remember that.

980
01:20:54,766 --> 01:20:56,351
I remember what suits me.

981
01:20:56,434 --> 01:20:57,453
If you forget this,
I won't ever do anything

982
01:20:57,477 --> 01:20:58,853
you don't want, I promise.

983
01:20:58,936 --> 01:20:59,955
I won't talk, I won't
do anything wrong...

984
01:20:59,979 --> 01:21:01,689
Of course, you won't, honey.

985
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,901
I decided how it was gonna be
with us when I took you in.

986
01:21:07,779 --> 01:21:09,947
Boys must be having trouble
finding their way.

987
01:21:18,581 --> 01:21:20,708
Ain't lost my touch.

988
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:22,377
Think I'll try for a pair.

989
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:31,469
Quiet now. Here they come.

990
01:22:06,003 --> 01:22:07,380
That's better, Howie.

991
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:10,091
Stand together, boys.

992
01:24:14,966 --> 01:24:16,175
Howie!

993
01:24:21,013 --> 01:24:23,349
Lina's hurt bad.

994
01:24:23,432 --> 01:24:26,561
Caught a ricochet.
She's bleeding something awful.

995
01:24:26,644 --> 01:24:28,688
How about a truce
so I can fix her up?

996
01:24:30,189 --> 01:24:31,482
What do you say, Howie?

997
01:25:47,350 --> 01:25:48,601
Lina!

998
01:25:51,854 --> 01:25:54,106
Lina, are you alright?

999
01:25:55,274 --> 01:25:56,525
I didn't know what to do.

1000
01:25:57,943 --> 01:25:59,278
- Where is...
- Kemp!

1001
01:27:09,974 --> 01:27:11,767
Roy! Roy!

1002
01:27:13,144 --> 01:27:15,521
I got him! I got him!

1003
01:27:15,604 --> 01:27:17,481
Come in alone,
we'll pull him in after!

1004
01:27:27,074 --> 01:27:28,325
Stop it!

1005
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:30,202
Ben's dead. Ain't that enough?

1006
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:45,426
Look!

1007
01:27:50,973 --> 01:27:52,641
Look out! Let go of him!

1008
01:27:53,809 --> 01:27:55,060
Look out!

1009
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:35,142
Cut him loose, Howie.

1010
01:28:35,226 --> 01:28:36,977
I'm taking him back.

1011
01:28:37,061 --> 01:28:39,313
This is what I came
after and now I got it.

1012
01:28:39,396 --> 01:28:41,398
No partners like I started.

1013
01:28:43,108 --> 01:28:45,110
He's gonna pay for my land.

1014
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:47,863
Jesse, and Roy, and him...

1015
01:28:47,947 --> 01:28:50,115
They're dead! Finished!

1016
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:52,326
Ben's not dead
if you take him back.

1017
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:54,578
He'll never be dead for you.

1018
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,497
I don't care anything
about that but money.

1019
01:28:56,580 --> 01:28:58,767
That's all I care about. That's
all I've ever cared about.

1020
01:28:58,791 --> 01:29:01,252
Roy, he called the turn.
He said, "Face up to it."

1021
01:29:01,335 --> 01:29:03,963
Alright, that's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing!

1022
01:29:05,339 --> 01:29:06,841
Maybe I don't fit your ideas
of me,

1023
01:29:06,924 --> 01:29:08,968
but that's the way I am.

1024
01:29:15,349 --> 01:29:18,519
Alright, if that's the way
you want it, I'll ride with you.

1025
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:20,271
I'll ride with you all the way.

1026
01:29:20,354 --> 01:29:21,354
I'm taking him back.

1027
01:29:21,397 --> 01:29:24,358
I know. I'll marry you.

1028
01:29:24,441 --> 01:29:27,695
I'll go with you, I'll even
live on that land with you.

1029
01:29:27,778 --> 01:29:29,488
What else do you want from me?

1030
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,532
Why?

1031
01:29:33,409 --> 01:29:34,535
Tell me why?

1032
01:29:35,786 --> 01:29:37,621
I'm taking him back, I swear it.

1033
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,167
I'm gonna sell him for money.

1034
01:30:34,803 --> 01:30:36,597
You still want
to try California?

1035
01:30:37,973 --> 01:30:39,141
If you want.

1036
01:30:40,851 --> 01:30:42,019
That's it, then.

1037
01:30:48,984 --> 01:30:51,070
I'll fix some of Jesse's
coffee for you.
