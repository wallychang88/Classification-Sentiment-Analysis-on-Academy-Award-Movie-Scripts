1
00:03:14,067 --> 00:03:15,652
<i>I have decided to keep a journal.</i>

2
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,739
<i>Not in a word program or digital file
but in longhand,</i>

3
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,910
<i>writing every word out
so that every inflection of penmanship,</i>

4
00:03:24,244 --> 00:03:27,914
<i>every word chosen, scratched out,
revised, is recorded.</i>

5
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:31,542
<i>To set down all my thoughts
and the simple events</i>

6
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,086
<i>of my day factually
and without hiding anything.</i>

7
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:39,049
<i>When writing about oneself,
one should show no mercy.</i>

8
00:03:40,801 --> 00:03:44,179
<i>I will keep this diary
for one year, 12 months</i>

9
00:03:45,013 --> 00:03:47,641
<i>and at the end of that time,
it will be destroyed.</i>

10
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:51,854
<i>Shredded, then burnt.
The experiment will be over.</i>

11
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:11,581
Please rise.

12
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:20,089
What is thy only comfort in life and death?

13
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,258
That I, with body and soul

14
00:04:22,341 --> 00:04:25,595
both in life and death, am not my own

15
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:29,849
but belong unto
my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ.

16
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,726
Who with his precious blood...

17
00:04:31,809 --> 00:04:34,728
<i>These thoughts and recollections are
not so different from those I confide</i>

18
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:35,812
<i>to God every morning.</i>

19
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:39,232
<i>When it is possible.</i>

20
00:04:40,108 --> 00:04:41,151
<i>When he is listening.</i>

21
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,825
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.

22
00:04:55,207 --> 00:04:57,584
The bread of life. The cup of salvation.

23
00:05:00,962 --> 00:05:02,964
The bread of life. The cup of salvation.

24
00:05:03,048 --> 00:05:04,966
<i>This journal is a form of speaking...</i>

25
00:05:06,383 --> 00:05:09,303
<i>of communication from one to the other.</i>

26
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:12,306
<i>A communication which can be achieved simply</i>

27
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,726
<i>and in repose without
prostration or abnegation.</i>

28
00:05:18,604 --> 00:05:19,730
<i>It is a form of prayer.</i>

29
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:23,692
Bread of life. The cup of salvation.

30
00:05:33,828 --> 00:05:36,330
There is a leak in the men's restroom.

31
00:05:36,413 --> 00:05:37,330
No, I fixed it.

32
00:05:37,413 --> 00:05:41,793
No. I was just there. It's still leaking.
Same place. Under the hot faucet.

33
00:05:41,876 --> 00:05:44,462
- What about the women's room?
- The women's is fine.

34
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:46,506
Do you want me to call
the plumber from Abundant Life?

35
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:47,966
No, let me have another crack at it.

36
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:50,301
I hate always bugging them
for extra little costs.

37
00:05:50,385 --> 00:05:52,095
They don't mind.
That's what they're there for.

38
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:54,806
- And you're totally within your budget.
- Still, I don't want to.

39
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,433
Have you posted the sermon?

40
00:05:57,892 --> 00:05:59,644
Yes. I did it this morning.

41
00:06:01,437 --> 00:06:02,355
- Oh...
- Reverend?

42
00:06:02,438 --> 00:06:04,482
Yes, Mary, right?

43
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,860
- Mary Mensana.
- Yeah, nice to see you again.

44
00:06:07,193 --> 00:06:09,111
I wanted to talk, if that's okay.

45
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:10,571
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on in, Mary.

46
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,365
- I'll be right back.
- Mary, how can I help you?

47
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:14,533
I was wondering if you would talk

48
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,368
- to my husband, Michael.
- Oh, sure. I...

49
00:06:16,451 --> 00:06:18,287
Actually, not now.
He has to... he has to go to work.

50
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:19,705
He has to fill in at Home Depot.

51
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,458
Mary?

52
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,129
- What is it?
- I'm worried about him.

53
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:29,673
He's involved in the Green Planet movement.

54
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:31,425
- It's an activist group.
- Mm-hmm.

55
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:33,260
And he was in jail in Canada.

56
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,387
And he just got out two weeks ago.

57
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:38,640
He just sits around at home.
He doesn't... he doesn't go out.

58
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:42,476
I got him to fill out a temp form
for Home... for Home Depot.

59
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,145
- Okay.
- So that's good.

60
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:45,938
Are you sure you don't want
to go to Abundant Life?

61
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:47,857
They have a whole team
of counselors over there,

62
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,859
- who are trained and...
- I know, but he doesn't want to.

63
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:51,777
He thinks it's more
of a company than a church.

64
00:06:52,153 --> 00:06:54,071
And so, he said he would talk to you.

65
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,199
Uh, all right.

66
00:06:58,284 --> 00:06:59,201
Tomorrow?

67
00:07:00,077 --> 00:07:01,621
- After lunch?
- Great. Great.

68
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:03,789
I'll just need the... I just need an address.

69
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,666
And can you tell me a little more?

70
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:09,879
Oh, he applied for compassionate release
when he found out.

71
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:11,964
He was at Fort Providence.
They let him out early.

72
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:14,966
- Wait, now, found out what?
- That I was pregnant.

73
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:18,178
Oh. Hmm, congratulations.

74
00:07:18,887 --> 00:07:19,804
Thanks.

75
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,734
He thinks it's wrong to bring
a child into this world.

76
00:07:28,196 --> 00:07:30,490
He wants to kill our baby.

77
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:38,373
<i>I assisted Sunday the youth group
at Abundant Life.</i>

78
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:41,501
<i>The young people were
so excited, so full of life.</i>

79
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:43,878
<i>They were open. They welcomed communion.</i>

80
00:07:48,298 --> 00:07:50,592
<i>Maybe I shouldn't care about
whether people like me.</i>

81
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,653
<i>Did Jesus worry about being liked?</i>

82
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:01,201
<i>I look at the last lines
I wrote with disdain.</i>

83
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:05,956
<i>Twelve months.</i>

84
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:09,209
<i>Can I keep up an exercise that long?</i>

85
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:26,517
<i>When I read these words,
I see not truth, but pride.</i>

86
00:08:32,732 --> 00:08:34,442
<i>I wish I had not used the word pride.</i>

87
00:08:35,735 --> 00:08:37,194
<i>But I cannot cross it out.</i>

88
00:08:42,658 --> 00:08:44,118
<i>If only I could pray.</i>

89
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:42,275
Hi, Reverend.

90
00:09:42,359 --> 00:09:45,820
- Hi. Is Michael home?
- Yeah. Come on in.

91
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:46,988
Okay. Yeah.

92
00:09:51,117 --> 00:09:53,243
- Hey. Good to see you.
- Nice to see you.

93
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:55,496
Um, would you like some coffee?

94
00:09:56,372 --> 00:09:59,375
- Yes, but, um...
- We're... I think we have some tea.

95
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:00,584
Yes. That would be better.

96
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,585
- Okay.
- Thanks.

97
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:06,090
Let me take your coat?

98
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,300
No, it's okay. I got it.

99
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:10,344
Come on in.

100
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:18,811
- Yeah, I don't know why Mary...
- There's no need to apologize.

101
00:10:19,144 --> 00:10:21,855
No, she told me
that you've been up in Canada.

102
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:25,942
Yeah. Fort Providence.

103
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,071
It's in the Mackenzie Delta.
It's way in the north.

104
00:10:30,154 --> 00:10:31,823
Yeah, beautiful country, I imagine.

105
00:10:31,906 --> 00:10:33,116
Yeah, it is.

106
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,830
Mary said things have been getting you down?

107
00:10:41,624 --> 00:10:45,545
Uh, yeah, things.
Yeah, you could say that. Yeah.

108
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,339
Oh! Thank you very much.

109
00:10:49,007 --> 00:10:50,049
- It's hot.
- Perfect.

110
00:10:51,175 --> 00:10:52,093
Thank you.

111
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:03,729
- So Mary is pregnant.
- Hmm.

112
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:08,358
- Yeah. How far along is she?
- Twenty weeks.

113
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,110
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

114
00:11:18,702 --> 00:11:21,329
Hey, how old are you, Reverend?

115
00:11:23,832 --> 00:11:24,750
I'm 46.

116
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:29,879
Uh, 33.

117
00:11:31,797 --> 00:11:34,925
That's how old our child will be in 2050.

118
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,594
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

119
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:39,388
You know, that's
two years older than I am right now.

120
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,514
Mm-hmm.

121
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,351
- You'll be 81.
- Yeah!

122
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:49,315
Hey, you know what the world
will be like in 2050?

123
00:11:49,398 --> 00:11:52,193
- Hmm. Hard to imagine.
- Yeah, you think?

124
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:59,491
I mean, Reverend,
the world is changing so fast.

125
00:12:00,617 --> 00:12:01,701
And right in front of us.

126
00:12:01,785 --> 00:12:06,331
I mean, one-third of the natural world
has been destroyed in your lifetime.

127
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:11,377
You know, the earth's temperature
will be three degrees centigrade higher.

128
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:13,671
Four is the threshold.

129
00:12:15,048 --> 00:12:19,010
You know, "Severe, widespread,
and irreversible impacts."

130
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:23,014
And when scientists say
stuff like that, you know?

131
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:25,517
And National Center
for Atmospheric Research...

132
00:12:27,852 --> 00:12:31,063
Lawrence Livermore,
Potsdam Institute. Reverend...

133
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:32,856
<i>He went on like that for some time.</i>

134
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:36,902
<i>By 2050, sea levels two feet
higher on the East Coast.</i>

135
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:40,030
<i>Low lying areas underwater across the world.</i>

136
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,783
<i>Bangladesh, 20% loss of landmass.</i>

137
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:46,036
<i>Central Africa, 50% reduction
in crops due to drought.</i>

138
00:12:46,411 --> 00:12:48,038
<i>The Western reservoirs dried up.</i>

139
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:51,208
<i>Climate change. Refugees.
Epidemics. Extreme weather.</i>

140
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:52,709
You know, the...

141
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,338
the bad times, they will begin,

142
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:58,549
and from that point,
everything moves very quickly.

143
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:05,012
You know, this social structure
can't bear the stress of multiple crises.

144
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,976
Opportunistic diseases, anarchy,
martial law, the tipping point.

145
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,061
And this isn't in some, like, distant future.

146
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:13,437
You will live to see this.

147
00:13:14,355 --> 00:13:18,526
You know, my children
will experience this un-livability.

148
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:19,735
This, uh...

149
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:22,321
Yeah, I'm sorry. I just... you know, I...

150
00:13:23,322 --> 00:13:25,241
I thought things could change, you know?

151
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:27,118
I thought... I thought people would listen.

152
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:29,245
Do you have thoughts of harming yourself?

153
00:13:31,914 --> 00:13:32,832
No.

154
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:36,126
Why? Did Mary say something like that?

155
00:13:36,209 --> 00:13:37,127
No, no.

156
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,296
No, I'm not worried for myself.

157
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,758
I just... this world is gonna be what it is.

158
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:46,970
- But can I ask you a question, Reverend?
- Mm-hmm.

159
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:51,975
How do you sanction
bringing in a little girl...

160
00:13:52,684 --> 00:13:56,188
Uh, for argument's sake,
let's just say that, uh...

161
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:59,733
Mary and I's child, it's a little girl.

162
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:07,364
You know, a child that's so full of hope...

163
00:14:09,241 --> 00:14:13,829
and naive beliefs into a world
where that little girl, uh...

164
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:19,668
she grows up to be a young woman
and she looks you in the eyes

165
00:14:19,752 --> 00:14:22,630
and she says that you knew
this all along, didn't you?

166
00:14:27,468 --> 00:14:28,385
You see, that...

167
00:14:30,638 --> 00:14:33,140
I mean, what are you supposed to say then?

168
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:38,478
There's something growing inside Mary.

169
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:43,691
Something as alive as a tree, surely.

170
00:14:44,275 --> 00:14:46,152
As an endangered species.

171
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,491
Something full of the beauty
and mystery of nature.

172
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:56,996
You said sanction, hmm?

173
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:00,083
You think Mary should have an abortion?

174
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:02,293
This birth, is that your right?

175
00:15:02,377 --> 00:15:03,419
Is that your decision?

176
00:15:03,878 --> 00:15:05,463
Have you asked Mary what she thinks?

177
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,639
Look, this isn't... it's not about your baby.

178
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,641
It's not about Mary.

179
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:21,103
It's about you...

180
00:15:22,437 --> 00:15:24,648
and your despair. Your lack of hope.

181
00:15:26,275 --> 00:15:28,652
Look, people have throughout history

182
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:32,739
have woken up in the dead of the night
confronted by blackness.

183
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,409
The sense that our lives are without meaning.

184
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,495
<i>The Sickness Unto Death.</i>

185
00:15:38,578 --> 00:15:40,247
Yeah, but this is something different.

186
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,164
Yeah, no, man's great achievements

187
00:15:42,248 --> 00:15:45,918
have brought him to the place
where life as we know it

188
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:47,753
may cease in the foreseeable future.

189
00:15:47,837 --> 00:15:48,879
Yes, that's new.

190
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,090
But the blackness?

191
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,677
That's not.

192
00:15:55,011 --> 00:15:57,013
We're scientific people.
We want to solve things.

193
00:15:57,096 --> 00:15:58,764
We want rational answers.

194
00:15:59,181 --> 00:16:03,394
Right? And if humankind can't overcome

195
00:16:03,477 --> 00:16:06,939
its immediate interests enough to ensure
its own survival, then you're right.

196
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:09,442
The only rational response is despair.

197
00:16:11,068 --> 00:16:15,113
But do you think that
there's any existence apart from this?

198
00:16:15,947 --> 00:16:17,407
This here, right now?

199
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,825
- Yes.
- Yeah, right, before us.

200
00:16:18,908 --> 00:16:19,826
- After us.
- Yeah.

201
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:21,911
- Yeah,
- Wait, so you're talking about

202
00:16:21,995 --> 00:16:23,288
the next lifetime? Huh?

203
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:24,831
You really... you just, uh...

204
00:16:24,914 --> 00:16:28,043
<i>I felt like I was Jacob wrestling
all night long with the angel.</i>

205
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:30,045
<i>Fighting in the grasp.</i>

206
00:16:31,296 --> 00:16:34,883
<i>Every sentence, every question,
every response, a mortal struggle.</i>

207
00:16:35,967 --> 00:16:37,260
<i>It was exhilarating.</i>

208
00:16:38,011 --> 00:16:39,804
You believe in martyrdom, Reverend?

209
00:16:39,888 --> 00:16:41,222
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

210
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,724
You know, the Saints of God?

211
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:46,018
The early Christians
who wouldn't renounce their faith?

212
00:16:46,518 --> 00:16:49,313
The missionaries who were attacked
in the fields of the Lord.

213
00:16:49,396 --> 00:16:51,273
Do you believe that they died for a purpose?

214
00:16:51,357 --> 00:16:53,067
- I do.
- Well, every week,

215
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:56,653
activists are killed
trying to protect the environment.

216
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:01,700
A hundred and seventeen were
killed last year for their beliefs.

217
00:17:04,036 --> 00:17:05,162
I mean, right there.

218
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:08,207
This is José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva.

219
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,794
Huh? And that's his wife, Maria.

220
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:19,801
Uh... they were... they were gunned down
in 2011 in the Amazon.

221
00:17:21,344 --> 00:17:24,880
You know, they were protesting
free cutting of the rain forest.

222
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:29,852
Hey, this is Dorothy Stang, 2005.

223
00:17:29,936 --> 00:17:32,814
She was a nun from Ohio.

224
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,610
And what was the purpose of their death?

225
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:48,870
You know, in 2010, the IPCC predicted

226
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:52,165
that if drastic action wasn't taken by 2015,

227
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,836
environmental collapse would be irreversible.

228
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:58,130
And nothing was done.

229
00:18:01,633 --> 00:18:03,385
And now it's 2017.

230
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:07,389
You said you respected me.
What I've been through.

231
00:18:09,766 --> 00:18:14,604
- Yes.
- So you know my story, hmm?

232
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,982
- Yeah, you were a chaplain.
- Uh-huh.

233
00:18:17,607 --> 00:18:21,444
My father taught at VMI.
I encouraged my son to enlist.

234
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:22,945
It was the family tradition.

235
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:28,325
Like his father, my father before me, hmm.

236
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:29,910
A patriotic tradition.

237
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:36,834
My wife... was very opposed.

238
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:39,295
My son enlisted anyway.

239
00:18:39,795 --> 00:18:42,840
And six months later, he was dead in Iraq.

240
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:49,555
Right? I talked my son into a war
that had no moral justification.

241
00:18:52,307 --> 00:18:53,975
My wife could no longer live with me.

242
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:56,102
I left the military.

243
00:18:57,896 --> 00:18:58,813
I was lost.

244
00:19:01,691 --> 00:19:04,027
And Reverend Jeffers from Abundant Life,

245
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:08,031
he gave me this position
at First Reformed and here I am.

246
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,533
And Michael, I can promise you...

247
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:16,956
that whatever despair you feel
about bringing a child into this world

248
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:21,836
cannot equal the despair
of taking a child from it.

249
00:19:34,223 --> 00:19:36,058
Hey, what was his name?

250
00:19:37,267 --> 00:19:38,185
Your son?

251
00:19:40,729 --> 00:19:41,647
Joseph.

252
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:44,650
The boy thrown down the well.

253
00:19:44,733 --> 00:19:46,652
- Yeah, I remember.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:49,363
- The dreamer.
- The dreamer, yeah. Yeah.

255
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:55,993
And you were able to just go on?

256
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,998
Courage... is the solution to despair.

257
00:20:01,332 --> 00:20:05,044
Reason... provides no answers.

258
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,090
I can't know what the future will bring.

259
00:20:09,173 --> 00:20:11,926
We have to choose despite uncertainty.

260
00:20:13,177 --> 00:20:19,892
Wisdom is holding two contradictory truths
in our mind, simultaneously.

261
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,895
Hope and despair.

262
00:20:22,979 --> 00:20:25,189
A life without despair
is a life without hope.

263
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:28,942
Holding these two ideas
in our head is life itself.

264
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:45,750
Are you a drinking man, Reverend?

265
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:49,963
- It doesn't help.
- No, I suppose not.

266
00:20:57,887 --> 00:20:59,055
Can God forgive us?

267
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:05,769
For what we've done to this world?

268
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,231
I don't know.

269
00:21:11,942 --> 00:21:13,402
Who can know the mind of God?

270
00:21:15,904 --> 00:21:16,864
But we can choose...

271
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,743
a righteous life.

272
00:21:22,077 --> 00:21:23,078
Belief.

273
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:25,331
Forgiveness.

274
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:29,877
Grace covers us all.

275
00:21:32,754 --> 00:21:33,838
I believe that.

276
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:44,515
Let's meet again.

277
00:21:44,974 --> 00:21:45,892
Want to?

278
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,436
Tomorrow after lunch, same time.

279
00:21:49,437 --> 00:21:51,356
Okay, yeah. It's a... it's a plan.

280
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:58,446
<i>I went over everything that was said,
what should have been said,</i>

281
00:21:58,529 --> 00:22:00,323
<i>what could have been said differently,</i>

282
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:01,783
<i>what could have been said better.</i>

283
00:22:03,784 --> 00:22:07,329
<i>"I know that nothing can change
and I know there is no hope."</i>

284
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:10,207
<i>Thomas Merton wrote this.</i>

285
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,338
<i>"Despair is a development of pride so great</i>

286
00:22:16,421 --> 00:22:18,465
<i>that it chooses one's certitude</i>

287
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:22,010
<i>rather than admit God
is more creative than we are."</i>

288
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,472
<i>Perhaps it's better I didn't say that to him.</i>

289
00:23:04,176 --> 00:23:05,970
<i>Who am I to talk about pride?</i>

290
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:30,577
Well, to begin, the church
was constructed in 1767

291
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,537
in a style we now call Dutch colonial.

292
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:36,750
It was made by settlers... follow me...
using local timber.

293
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,793
First Reformed took seven years to build.

294
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,545
The Vei Plancks.

295
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,923
Effie here, her tombstone dates back to 1787.

296
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:49,595
The church was partially rebuilt
in 1837 following a fire.

297
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,848
This section remains preserved.

298
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:57,186
If you look closely behind
the Continental Army flag,

299
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,438
you'll find two bullet holes

300
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:03,025
from shots fired during
the Skirmish of Snowbridge.

301
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:07,821
In two months we're celebrating
our 250th anniversary.

302
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:11,365
Here is an example of some
of the church's chinaware

303
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,867
brought over from the Netherlands.

304
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,453
And the first chalice. It's beautiful.

305
00:24:15,828 --> 00:24:19,248
And here, this is the original key
from the front door before the fire.

306
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,666
Isn't that neat? Yeah.

307
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,295
And in that cabinet we have
souvenirs that are for sale.

308
00:24:24,378 --> 00:24:29,300
We have mugs, caps, postcards,
key chains, pens, t-shirts.

309
00:24:29,383 --> 00:24:30,343
What size are these?

310
00:24:30,426 --> 00:24:31,844
Unfortunately, they are all small.

311
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,597
I have some more on order,
but I'm waiting for them to come in.

312
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,890
The caps are great, though.

313
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:38,392
It's a one-size-fits-all.

314
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:44,940
The pulpit was donated in 1879
by William Mercer.

315
00:24:45,023 --> 00:24:47,234
And the church organ,

316
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:50,028
which unfortunately
isn't working at this time,

317
00:24:51,404 --> 00:24:53,990
was manufactured in England by A.G. Hill.

318
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:57,828
Did you hear the one about
the choir mistress and the minister?

319
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:00,997
- No.
- She chased him

320
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:02,916
around the church
and caught him by the organ.

321
00:25:05,043 --> 00:25:08,922
Huh. Oh, no, I hadn't heard that one.

322
00:25:09,381 --> 00:25:10,757
All right, come on. Follow me.

323
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,093
All right, thank you all very much.

324
00:25:14,927 --> 00:25:16,011
- Be well.
- Thank you.

325
00:25:16,095 --> 00:25:18,054
Yeah, thanks a lot.

326
00:25:21,475 --> 00:25:22,601
Drive safe.

327
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:26,689
Thanks.

00:26:35,213 --> 00:26:37,883
<i># Are your garments spotless? #</i>

345
00:26:37,966 --> 00:26:40,761
<i># Are they white as snow? #</i>

346
00:26:40,844 --> 00:26:45,349
<i># Are you washed
In the blood of the lamb? #</i>

347
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:48,602
<i># Are your garments spotless? #</i>

348
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:51,562
<i># Are they white as snow? #</i>

349
00:26:51,938 --> 00:26:58,945
<i># Are you washed
In the blood of the lamb? #</i>

350
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:01,489
Okay, take five.

351
00:27:06,077 --> 00:27:10,247
- Penny for your thoughts?
- Oh, Joel wanted to talk to me.

352
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:13,209
- Nothing serious, I hope.
- Oh, I assume not.

353
00:27:14,585 --> 00:27:15,795
You want to have lunch?

354
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:20,383
Well, I have something after but yeah,
I could sit with you for a second.

355
00:27:23,927 --> 00:27:25,178
Oh, remember that?

356
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,596
What?

357
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,182
When everything was ahead of you.

358
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,770
Yeah. But try telling them that.

359
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:35,647
See you then.

360
00:27:57,084 --> 00:27:58,002
Hello.

361
00:27:58,627 --> 00:27:59,545
- Reverend Toller.
- Yes.

362
00:27:59,628 --> 00:28:00,546
- Oh, go right in.
- Okay.

363
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:01,797
He's expecting you.

364
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:12,391
Um, this is... that's my wife's stuff, so.

365
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,328
Go ahead and deal with it.

366
00:28:16,603 --> 00:28:19,648
Oh, good! Reverend Toller. Come on in.

367
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:23,610
Roger, make sure you get back to me
as soon as you can on that.

368
00:28:23,694 --> 00:28:24,902
- Hey, Reverend.
- Good seeing you.

369
00:28:24,986 --> 00:28:26,195
Why don't you have a seat there?

370
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:29,615
Roger, okay to leave that door open.

371
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:32,618
- Can I get you a water or anything?
- Oh, no, I'm good, I'm good.

372
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:36,497
- So how are things over at First Reformed?
- Oh, busy. You know how it is.

373
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,959
You do one thing to the other,
next thing you know it's Sunday again.

374
00:28:40,209 --> 00:28:41,961
Yeah, tell me about it.

375
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:45,923
Well, I brought you in, I wanted to ask you
about the 250th reconsecration.

376
00:28:46,007 --> 00:28:47,884
Now, that's just around the corner.

377
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:50,428
Yeah, of course. It's only eight weeks away.

378
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,138
And how's the planning going on that?

379
00:28:52,722 --> 00:28:55,058
Well, your office is handling the invitations

380
00:28:55,141 --> 00:28:56,641
and I'm a little worried about seating.

381
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:59,519
I mean, because we have your staff,
we have the elders, we have the deacons.

382
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,814
We have the governor, his people.
The mayor, his people.

383
00:29:02,898 --> 00:29:04,274
We don't have any room for spillover.

384
00:29:04,357 --> 00:29:05,984
You know, it's the sanctuary and that's it.

385
00:29:06,485 --> 00:29:10,155
You know what, I think we'll simulcast
the ceremony here, in the main room.

386
00:29:10,238 --> 00:29:11,615
- All right.
- So that's 5,000 seats.

387
00:29:11,698 --> 00:29:12,866
Yeah, okay. Well, then...

388
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:14,993
We can do the reception in the rotunda.

389
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:18,163
The organ at First Reformed.

390
00:29:18,246 --> 00:29:19,915
- Is that fixed?
- Yeah, no, it's not.

391
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:23,543
We're waiting on some pieces.

392
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:26,797
I don't... it was... it's just more
complicated than we thought at first.

393
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,007
Well, we can't have a reconsecration
without an organ.

394
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:33,886
"A Mighty Fortress is our God."

395
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:35,763
That's all organ.

396
00:29:35,846 --> 00:29:39,308
Did you know that
Martin Luther wrote that in an outhouse?

397
00:29:39,391 --> 00:29:40,434
Oh, yeah.

398
00:29:40,518 --> 00:29:45,439
"A Mighty Fortress"...

399
00:29:47,066 --> 00:29:48,859
I think every seminarian knows that one.

400
00:29:48,943 --> 00:29:51,821
Oh, man, I cannot get
that image out of my mind.

401
00:29:51,904 --> 00:29:56,158
I mean, whenever I see that song going on,
and I can look around the congregation

402
00:29:56,242 --> 00:29:58,786
and know everybody's thinking the same thing.

403
00:29:58,869 --> 00:30:03,248
This man, oh, goodness. Oh, makes me laugh.

404
00:30:03,331 --> 00:30:06,126
Anyway, have you prepared your remarks?

405
00:30:06,209 --> 00:30:09,504
Oh, no. Not yet, but I will.

406
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:12,924
- So how are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

407
00:30:13,883 --> 00:30:14,801
No, really.

408
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:18,138
I mean, it's been awhile since we've talked.

409
00:30:18,221 --> 00:30:20,306
And you know, even a pastor needs a pastor.

410
00:30:21,432 --> 00:30:22,433
We should do it, okay?

411
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:24,185
I'd like that.

412
00:30:24,269 --> 00:30:26,271
Good. And come by here more often.

413
00:30:26,604 --> 00:30:29,607
You should get out.
Come on by and be a part of things.

414
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,775
So many activities you can do, and...

415
00:30:31,859 --> 00:30:33,402
- And the kids like you a lot.
- Mmm.

416
00:30:33,485 --> 00:30:34,778
They always speak highly of you.

417
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:37,156
So you can get out of that...
what is the play?

418
00:30:37,239 --> 00:30:38,866
What do they like to call it
over where you are?

419
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:43,203
- The museum.
- The souvenir shop.

420
00:30:43,829 --> 00:30:45,122
They call it the souvenir shop.

421
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:47,583
Well, good. Well, good.
You're doing a great job.

422
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,669
I'm grateful for the opportunity.

423
00:31:21,365 --> 00:31:22,909
How was Jeffers?

424
00:31:22,992 --> 00:31:25,536
Oh, he wants me to meet Ed Balq.

425
00:31:26,078 --> 00:31:29,498
Balq Industries, Balq Energy,
Balq Paper, Balq Peanuts...

426
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:30,499
Why?

427
00:31:31,125 --> 00:31:34,670
Well, it's all about the reconsecration.

428
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:37,297
And apparently Mr. Balq wants
to make sure he gets

429
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,008
proper credit for underwriting
the whole thing.

430
00:31:40,091 --> 00:31:41,092
Well, he should.

431
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:43,511
First Reformed would be a parking lot
if it wasn't for him.

432
00:31:43,595 --> 00:31:44,512
I guess.

433
00:31:46,264 --> 00:31:47,515
Did you see the doctor?

434
00:31:49,351 --> 00:31:50,894
Yes, I made an appointment.

435
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,480
There was a bit of a hang up
with the insurance company, but...

436
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,690
God, they make it so difficult.

437
00:31:57,025 --> 00:31:59,986
- Yeah, well, that's what they do.
- Mm-hmm.

438
00:32:01,154 --> 00:32:02,906
You need someone to take care of you.

439
00:32:06,284 --> 00:32:10,287
Esther, we tried that. I'm not made for that.

440
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:14,208
For what? Love?
You're not made for love?

441
00:32:16,168 --> 00:32:17,419
My marriage was a failure.

442
00:32:19,296 --> 00:32:21,882
No marriage can survive the loss of a child.

443
00:32:28,264 --> 00:32:29,181
It's not right.

444
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:34,812
Is that what you think?

445
00:32:35,771 --> 00:32:37,356
That what we did together was a sin?

446
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:40,942
- That we transgressed?
- No, that's not what I think.

447
00:32:41,901 --> 00:32:45,113
I've seen enough real sin
to know the difference. It's just...

448
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:47,907
Okay?

449
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:49,242
Okay.

450
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,327
I understand, I...

451
00:32:52,662 --> 00:32:54,497
I care about you. I want you to be happy.

452
00:32:57,458 --> 00:32:58,584
Well, I am happy.

453
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,862
<i>Some are called for their gregariousness.</i>

454
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:10,489
<i>Some are called for their suffering.</i>

455
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:14,284
<i>Others are called for their loneliness.</i>

456
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:16,703
<i>They are called by God</i>

457
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,664
<i>because through the vessel of communication,</i>

458
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:19,873
<i>they can reach out</i>

459
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:21,959
<i>and hold beating hearts in their hands.</i>

460
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:26,713
<i>They are called because
of their all-consuming knowledge</i>

461
00:33:26,797 --> 00:33:28,757
<i>of the emptiness of all things</i>

462
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,427
<i>that can only be filled
by the presence of our Savior.</i>

463
00:33:38,308 --> 00:33:40,060
- Yes?
- <i>Reverend Toller?</i>

464
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,145
- Oh!
- <i>It's me.</i>

465
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:42,146
Yes, Mary?

466
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,523
I got your message about rescheduling.

467
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,984
<i>You must come over. Now.</i>

468
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,696
- Is Michael there?
- <i>No, he's at work.</i>

469
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:55,283
- <i>You must come over now.</i>
- Okay. Okay.

470
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,278
Thanks for coming.

471
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:26,449
Follow me.

472
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:48,262
I was looking for some batteries
'cause we were out.

473
00:34:48,345 --> 00:34:50,973
And I thought maybe
there'd be some in here, you know?

474
00:34:51,056 --> 00:34:54,143
And then something just didn't seem right.

475
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,147
Okay, I put everything back
the way I found it,

476
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:01,984
'cause I wanted you to see how it was.

477
00:35:18,585 --> 00:35:19,753
Explosives?

478
00:35:21,171 --> 00:35:22,505
It's a suicide vest.

479
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:25,091
And there's other elements in there, too.

480
00:35:25,175 --> 00:35:30,055
There's batteries and detonators
and tubes of jelly.

481
00:35:32,807 --> 00:35:35,769
You know, he'd been working
in the garage lately,

482
00:35:35,852 --> 00:35:38,938
and he said he was fixing a motor.

483
00:35:39,814 --> 00:35:41,232
And I didn't question him.

484
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:42,609
'Cause I was just happy

485
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:44,903
that he was doing something
that made him happy.

486
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,988
But you had no idea
that he was thinking of...

487
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:50,199
No, no suspicions. Nothing like this.

488
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:52,868
All right, well,
I'm gonna take this, all right?

489
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,495
This cannot remain here.

490
00:35:54,578 --> 00:35:58,457
I'm gonna take it and dispose of it. And...

491
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,209
You're not gonna go to the police?

492
00:36:00,793 --> 00:36:02,461
No, I won't... do you... do you want me to?

493
00:36:02,544 --> 00:36:05,422
- No! No, no, no.
- I don't think it'd help.

494
00:36:05,506 --> 00:36:07,299
I don't think anything good

495
00:36:07,383 --> 00:36:09,093
will come from him feeling threatened.

496
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:12,638
I'm gonna come over tomorrow. Tomorrow.

497
00:36:13,681 --> 00:36:17,226
Somehow, through conversation,
I will address this.

498
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:20,688
I'm so frightened.

499
00:36:20,771 --> 00:36:22,730
You don't mean
that he... you're afraid of him?

500
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,273
- That he's gonna hurt you, right?
- No.

501
00:36:24,357 --> 00:36:26,234
- No, no, no. I'm afraid for him.
- No? Okay, all right.

502
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:27,485
You know, are there other activists,

503
00:36:27,568 --> 00:36:29,821
- like, coming around, calling?
- No. There's nobody.

504
00:36:29,904 --> 00:36:32,824
He has no friends.
He's barely even sociable, so.

505
00:36:33,491 --> 00:36:34,575
All right, but he has you.

506
00:36:36,035 --> 00:36:36,994
- Yeah.
- You'll stand by him?

507
00:36:37,537 --> 00:36:40,123
- Yeah, absolutely.
- All right. Well, so will I.

508
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,514
<i>Discernment intersects
with Christian life at every moment.</i>

509
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,268
<i>Discernment.</i>

510
00:37:04,396 --> 00:37:07,858
<i>Listening and waiting for God's wish
what action must be taken.</i>

511

513
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:38,228
<i>The desire to pray itself
is a type of prayer.</i>

514
00:37:39,388 --> 00:37:43,768
<i>How often we ask for genuine experience
when all we really want is emotion.</i>

515
00:37:48,814 --> 00:37:51,150
<i>My hands shake as I write these lines.</i>

516
00:38:11,753 --> 00:38:13,588
I wasn't expecting you
for another couple of weeks.

517
00:38:14,752 --> 00:38:16,295
We got a message from the boss.

518
00:38:16,378 --> 00:38:18,005
He said it was a top priority.

519
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,673
You're having some kind of big event here?

520
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:23,511
Yeah, the church is having
its 250th anniversary.

521
00:38:23,594 --> 00:38:26,597
Abundant Life is planning quite the ceremony.

522
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,063
Hmm. "A Mighty Fortress."

523
00:40:31,287 --> 00:40:32,705
Jesus.

524
00:40:36,166 --> 00:40:37,483
My God.

525
00:41:01,608 --> 00:41:02,692
Yeah, see that?

526
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,070
I mean, he had been fighting with depression.

527
00:41:05,153 --> 00:41:06,654
That's why I was supposed to meet him.

528
00:41:07,571 --> 00:41:09,365
I never imagined anything like this.

529
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:12,368
Were you in touch with the immediate family?

530
00:41:12,451 --> 00:41:14,078
Well, his wife, Mary.

531
00:41:14,161 --> 00:41:16,413
She's the one who first
asked me to meet with him.

532
00:41:17,122 --> 00:41:18,457
Did she know about your text?

533
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:21,752
No, but she was concerned. We both were.

534
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:25,214
Hmm. Have you notified her?

535
00:41:27,257 --> 00:41:30,177
- No.
- I guess that's where I'm headed.

536
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,054
All right. Okay.

537
00:41:32,471 --> 00:41:34,598
All right, do you mind
if I follow behind you?

538
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,976
- All right.
- I knew his father.

539
00:41:38,852 --> 00:41:42,063
- Really? What's he like?
- A businessman.

540
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:46,317
Morbid son of a bitch.
I guess it runs in the blood.

541
00:41:56,994 --> 00:41:58,162
Thank you, Reverend.

542
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:03,334
Mrs. Mensana, hey again,
I'm sorry for your loss.

543
00:42:03,418 --> 00:42:05,253
If there's anything else that
we can do, please let us know.

544
00:42:05,336 --> 00:42:06,963
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Reverend.

545
00:42:07,046 --> 00:42:07,964
Thank you.

546
00:42:22,769 --> 00:42:24,187
You didn't tell the police, right?

547
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:26,648
About?

548
00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:28,316
No.

549
00:42:29,526 --> 00:42:30,444
No.

550
00:42:32,112 --> 00:42:35,282
If you find anything else...

551
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,953
like that, get rid of it.

552
00:42:41,163 --> 00:42:43,414
As long as it's safe, I mean.
Burn it, bury it.

553
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:47,293
Michael was troubled but his cause was just.

554
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:50,004
There's no reason to bring
disrepute on that cause.

555
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:54,091
Are you an activist as well?

556
00:42:55,968 --> 00:42:57,595
I share Michael's beliefs.

557
00:43:00,222 --> 00:43:03,225
But not his despair. I mean, I wanna live.

558
00:43:03,309 --> 00:43:04,351
- I wanna be a mother.
- Right.

559
00:43:04,435 --> 00:43:06,520
I wanna have this child.

560
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:09,565
Do you have family nearby?

561
00:43:09,648 --> 00:43:11,901
My... yeah, my sister. She's in Buffalo.

562
00:43:11,984 --> 00:43:13,944
- You might want to call her.
- I will.

563
00:43:24,162 --> 00:43:26,706
So he went into the garage?

564
00:43:29,501 --> 00:43:30,418
Yeah.

565
00:43:33,046 --> 00:43:33,963
What did he say?

566
00:43:35,798 --> 00:43:36,716
Nothing.

567
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,269
Well, from a police point of view,

568
00:43:49,353 --> 00:43:53,607
I imagine this is
a pretty cut-and-dried case.

569
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:58,779
Still, I'd probably clean up the office,
maybe get rid of his laptop.

570
00:44:04,701 --> 00:44:05,619
You...

571
00:44:31,227 --> 00:44:32,228
Open it.

572
00:45:05,468 --> 00:45:06,678
I'd sensed it.

573
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:08,930
What?

574
00:45:10,932 --> 00:45:11,975
He was absent.

575
00:45:15,228 --> 00:45:17,272
He was becoming someone I didn't know.

576
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,776
Like, before I was pregnant even.

577
00:45:25,529 --> 00:45:28,198
And he was just so full of anger, you know?

578
00:45:33,787 --> 00:45:35,664
Yeah, I should probably call my parents.

579
00:45:36,498 --> 00:45:37,416
My sister.

580
00:45:40,336 --> 00:45:42,713
They should... they should know.

581
00:45:45,424 --> 00:45:47,217
<i>I stayed while she called her sister.</i>

582
00:45:47,968 --> 00:45:49,720
<i>Her sister was going to drive down</i>

583
00:45:50,846 --> 00:45:52,973
<i>and her parents would come
for the final rights.</i>

584
00:45:58,311 --> 00:45:59,479
Hey, Bill. Chicken or beef?

585
00:46:00,063 --> 00:46:01,397
- Beef.
- Beef. Okay, great.

586
00:46:02,023 --> 00:46:02,940
How've you been?

587
00:46:03,316 --> 00:46:05,318
- I'm all right. Yeah.
- You okay?

588
00:46:08,112 --> 00:46:10,448
- Is that enough for you?
- Thanks a lot, Reverend.

589
00:46:11,824 --> 00:46:13,242
Did you want the chicken or the beef?

590
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:16,120
- Uh, the beef, thank you.
- Beef? Yeah.

591
00:46:17,664 --> 00:46:20,291
There you are. Careful, it's hot.

592
00:46:21,626 --> 00:46:23,419
Reverend, I wanted to ask you...

593
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:25,046
Oh, sh...

594
00:46:25,254 --> 00:46:27,881
Damn, I'm sorry, Joseph! I'm so sorry.

595
00:46:28,799 --> 00:46:29,716
<i>Terrible night.</i>

596
00:46:30,926 --> 00:46:34,012
<i>No sooner than I shut my eyes,
desolation came upon me.</i>

597
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:38,475
<i>What is one's last thought
as you pull the trigger?</i>

598
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,687
<i>"There goes my head."</i>

599
00:46:42,479 --> 00:46:45,023
<i>Or, "Jesus, watch over me."</i>

600
00:46:45,565 --> 00:46:46,483
<i>Or neither?</i>

601
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:49,778
<i>I'm going to tear these pages out.</i>

602
00:46:50,862 --> 00:46:52,447
<i>This journal brings me no peace.</i>

603
00:46:53,407 --> 00:46:55,492
<i>It's self-pity. Nothing more.</i>

604
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,904
<i>I awoke at 3:00 with a cry.</i>

605
00:47:36,072 --> 00:47:39,409
<i>It's been five months
since I sensed the first warning signs.</i>

606
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:46,624
<i>I went into the church
and fell asleep on a bench.</i>

607
00:47:53,381 --> 00:47:55,425
<i>How easily they talk about prayer,</i>

608
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:57,761
<i>those who have never really prayed.</i>

609
00:48:04,391 --> 00:48:05,476
Excuse me?

610
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:09,271
Oh, my goodness!

611
00:48:11,231 --> 00:48:15,869
Well, since I made my commitment,
I have felt the Lord moving in my life.

612
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:19,673
If happiness came in pill size,
it would have JC stamped on it.

613
00:48:21,617 --> 00:48:22,993
Continuous release size.

614
00:48:24,203 --> 00:48:26,997
I wake up feeling better.

615
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:31,877
My relationships are better
and I got a raise last week.

616
00:48:32,585 --> 00:48:35,254
I find myself in prayer
without even thinking about it.

617
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:40,510
Thank you, Jason. That is very inspiring.

618
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:45,223
Praise Jesus. My every breath is a prayer.

619
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:49,852
Thoughts? Reactions? Yes? Cynthia.

620
00:48:50,853 --> 00:48:52,897
Three months ago, my father got laid off.

621
00:48:54,273 --> 00:48:55,399
He can't find any work.

622
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,069
Nobody loves the Lord more than my father.

623
00:48:58,152 --> 00:49:00,905
He is always testifying, he volunteers.

624
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:03,241
Did he do something wrong?

625
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:10,372
You all know Reverend Toller
from First Reformed.

626
00:49:11,456 --> 00:49:13,542
- Hello.
- Hey, yeah. Hi. Yeah.

627
00:49:14,459 --> 00:49:17,337
How do you answer this, Reverend?

628
00:49:18,338 --> 00:49:21,216
Well, Cynthia, I'm sorry
that happened to your father.

629
00:49:21,716 --> 00:49:26,304
There's a lot of church people,
good Christians, who see a connection

630
00:49:26,388 --> 00:49:29,391
between godliness and prosperity.

631
00:49:30,225 --> 00:49:31,935
But that's not what Jesus teaches.

632
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:33,687
That's not what Jesus lived.

633
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,605
There's no dollar sign on His pulpit.

634
00:49:36,188 --> 00:49:37,815
There's no American flag either.

635
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:42,236
I think, Cynthia, what your father
is experiencing is...

636
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:43,863
Christians shouldn't succeed.

637
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:47,408
That's what he means.
Christianity is for losers?

638
00:49:47,867 --> 00:49:49,368
Jake, Jake!

639
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,287
I just get tired of turn the other cheek.

640
00:49:51,787 --> 00:49:53,330
Jesus didn't turn the other cheek.

641
00:49:53,831 --> 00:49:54,832
Why stand for anything?

642
00:49:55,541 --> 00:49:56,876
Take prayer out of the schools.

643
00:49:57,418 --> 00:49:59,879
Give money to people too lazy to work for it.

644
00:49:59,962 --> 00:50:01,630
And whatever you do,
don't offend the Muslims.

645
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:04,758
I mean, no sooner do I mention the poor,

646
00:50:04,842 --> 00:50:06,886
and this teenager jumps down my throat

647
00:50:06,969 --> 00:50:09,387
like I just took a shit on the American flag.

648
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:12,891
Forgive my language. Oh, God!

649
00:50:12,974 --> 00:50:13,892
I know. Roger told me.

650
00:50:13,975 --> 00:50:16,769
He was great. He was terrific.
He's a good man.

651
00:50:16,853 --> 00:50:18,146
Well, he said you kept your cool

652
00:50:18,229 --> 00:50:19,272
and he admired you for that.

653
00:50:19,814 --> 00:50:21,482
There's just no middle ground
with these kids.

654
00:50:21,566 --> 00:50:23,359
Everything is so extreme.

655
00:50:23,735 --> 00:50:25,486
It's the times. These are frightening times.

656
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:27,822
These kids, they grow up in a world

657
00:50:27,906 --> 00:50:30,158
that you and I, we wouldn't even recognize.

658
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:34,370
Global warming, a sea of pornography,

659
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:36,456
hyper violent video games.

660
00:50:36,539 --> 00:50:37,874
It's a world without privacy.

661
00:50:38,374 --> 00:50:41,585
Each kid isolated, communicating on media.

662
00:50:42,336 --> 00:50:43,545
It's a world without hope!

663
00:50:44,171 --> 00:50:45,714
You don't know what it's like
to raise a kid in this...

664
00:50:45,797 --> 00:50:46,965
No, I did raise a kid.

665
00:50:49,009 --> 00:50:51,303
- I didn't mean it like that.
- I know you didn't.

666
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,640
They're just frightened.

667
00:50:54,723 --> 00:50:56,642
- These kids, they want certainty.
- Mm-hmm.

668
00:50:56,725 --> 00:50:58,769
You know, don't think: follow.

669
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:03,023
But they fall prey to extremism.

670
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:06,109
Jihadism is everywhere.

671
00:51:06,610 --> 00:51:07,527
Even here.

672
00:51:07,611 --> 00:51:10,739
It's just... that's not
the church that called me.

673
00:51:10,822 --> 00:51:11,948
Nor me.

674
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:15,076
It's up to us. We have to listen and guide

675
00:51:15,159 --> 00:51:19,497
and encourage our young members
to express themselves

676
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:20,748
without judging them.

677
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:22,333
We have to lead by example.

678
00:51:23,542 --> 00:51:24,710
We have to be patient.

679
00:51:35,348 --> 00:51:39,517
Oh, this sounds great. I'm gonna have to
sharpen my chops for the reconsecration.

680
00:51:40,009 --> 00:51:41,644
Do you know what they want to play?

681
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:43,979
No, I have no idea.
Abundant Life is handling everything.

682
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:45,271
Invites, the seating.

683
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,357
Basically, I just introduce Joel.

684
00:51:47,857 --> 00:51:51,695
And then he does his spiel,
introduces the governor, maybe Ed Balq.

685
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:55,323
- Oh, why him?
- It's sort of his whole deal.

686
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:58,159
I mean, he's underwritten the whole thing,
paid to have the organ fixed.

687
00:51:58,910 --> 00:51:59,828
I do have another...

688
00:51:59,911 --> 00:52:02,755
- Oh, take it from the top.
- ...musical question for you.

689
00:52:16,301 --> 00:52:19,596
It's actually
a... kind of sad bit of business.

690
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:21,640
- Hmm?
- The Michael Mensana memorial.

691
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:25,310
The scattering of his ashes.
He's asked me to arrange it.

692
00:52:26,729 --> 00:52:27,730
He's asked you?

693
00:52:29,106 --> 00:52:32,401
Well, he wrote a letter.
He had some requests.

694
00:52:37,406 --> 00:52:39,033
Then the Lord spoke to Job,

695
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:40,784
stepped from the storm.

696
00:52:42,077 --> 00:52:44,455
He said, "Where were you
when I laid the earth's foundations,

697
00:52:44,538 --> 00:52:48,166
marked out its dimensions,
laid its cornerstone?

698
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:53,254
When the morning stars sang,

699
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:58,342
and the angels
shouted with joy, where were you?"

700
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,681
These surroundings were chosen by Michael

701
00:53:03,765 --> 00:53:06,100
as the repository for his physical remains.

702
00:53:06,768 --> 00:53:08,394
I say physical because his memories

703
00:53:08,478 --> 00:53:10,063
and spirit live on with us,

704
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,106
as does his mission.

705
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:14,859
Michael cared about this world.

706
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:17,361
Perhaps too much.

707
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:22,407
The Abundant Life youth choir
will now sing for us

708
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:24,367
a song chosen by Michael.

709
00:53:36,973 --> 00:53:42,052
<i># Protect the wild, tomorrow's child #</i>

710
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:47,516
<i># Protect the land from the greed of man #</i>

711
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:53,062
<i># Take out the dams, stand up to oil #</i>

712
00:53:53,687 --> 00:53:58,150
<i># Protect the plants and renew the soil #</i>

713
00:53:58,943 --> 00:54:03,155
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

714
00:54:04,073 --> 00:54:08,285
<i># Who's gonna say that she's had enough? #</i>

715
00:54:08,953 --> 00:54:13,332
<i># Who's gonna take on the big machine? #</i>

716
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:17,920
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

717
00:54:18,379 --> 00:54:22,590
<i># This all starts with you and me #</i>

718
00:54:26,427 --> 00:54:28,555
<i># End fossil fuels #</i>

719
00:54:29,055 --> 00:54:30,890
<i># Draw the line #</i>

720
00:54:31,307 --> 00:54:35,520
<i># Before we build one more pipeline #</i>

721
00:54:36,271 --> 00:54:38,064
<i># End fracking now #</i>

722
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:40,525
<i># Let's save the water #</i>

723
00:54:41,109 --> 00:54:45,280
<i># And build a life
For our sons and daughters #</i>

724
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:50,285
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

725
00:54:50,994 --> 00:54:54,955
<i># Who's gonna say that she's had enough? #</i>

726
00:54:55,831 --> 00:54:59,877
<i># Who's gonna take on the big machine? #</i>

727
00:55:00,669 --> 00:55:04,715
<i># Who's gonna stand up
And save the Earth? #</i>

728
00:55:05,132 --> 00:55:10,012
<i># This all starts with you and me #</i>

729
00:55:33,117 --> 00:55:34,160
- I'm good.
- All right.

730
00:55:47,215 --> 00:55:48,507
- Mr. Balq!
- Hey!

731
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:50,009
- Hello!
- How are you?

732
00:55:50,092 --> 00:55:51,594
- Very good, very good.
- Good, good, good.

733
00:55:53,471 --> 00:55:57,266
Hey. Sorry I'm late. I got... I got held up.

734
00:55:57,682 --> 00:55:59,351
Oh, good. You know Reverend Toller, right?

735
00:55:59,434 --> 00:56:00,977
Well, only by sight. Ed Balq.

736
00:56:01,061 --> 00:56:02,479
- Good to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

737
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:05,106
Just bring me a coffee

738
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,108
- and the apple pie, all right?
- Okay. Thank you.

739
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,277
The apple pie.

740
00:56:09,361 --> 00:56:11,905
I know it's a cliché
but they make it right here.

741
00:56:11,988 --> 00:56:13,740
It's organic. It's local.

742
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:16,201
I have a surprise for you.

743
00:56:16,284 --> 00:56:21,039
I stopped by the printer on the way over.

744
00:56:23,875 --> 00:56:24,793
Oh.

745
00:56:25,627 --> 00:56:29,130
Oh, nice. Nice. They did a great job.

746
00:56:29,214 --> 00:56:32,299
Yeah, all the guests
at the reconsecration will get a copy.

747
00:56:32,383 --> 00:56:34,134
And then there will also be a mailing.

748
00:56:34,218 --> 00:56:36,512
And of course it will be
available at the bookstore.

749
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:38,055
So how are the plans coming?

750
00:56:38,764 --> 00:56:40,015
Is the organ repaired?

751
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:42,351
Oh, yeah. It sounds beautiful.
Better than ever.

752
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:47,481
Okay. We drew up a little seating chart.

753
00:56:48,065 --> 00:56:49,817
Now, Mayor Wilson will be there,

754
00:56:50,234 --> 00:56:51,193
as well as the governor.

755
00:56:51,277 --> 00:56:52,319
Well, at least he's going to try...

756
00:56:52,403 --> 00:56:53,988
<i>All of those mighty men of God,</i>

757
00:56:54,905 --> 00:56:56,323
<i>servants of the cross.</i>

758
00:56:56,407 --> 00:57:00,786
<i>Years of service, baptisms,
confessions, funerals, sermons.</i>

759
00:57:00,869 --> 00:57:02,245
<i>The hours in prayer,</i>

760
00:57:02,704 --> 00:57:04,247
<i>the afflictions suffered.</i>

761
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,165
<i>Did God give them strength?</i>

762
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,418
Reverend Toller will introduce me.

763
00:57:08,668 --> 00:57:10,670
I'll go up, I'll introduce the governor.

764
00:57:11,004 --> 00:57:12,922
There'll be a song selection.
Now, the main...

765
00:57:13,006 --> 00:57:14,757
There won't be anything
political though, will there?

766
00:57:15,508 --> 00:57:17,593
No. No, why would there be?

767
00:57:18,386 --> 00:57:19,679
Well... oh, sorry. Do you mind?

768
00:57:19,762 --> 00:57:20,763
Here you are.

769
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:22,390
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

770
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:24,684
- Well, I ask...
- Enjoy.

771
00:57:24,767 --> 00:57:27,770
...only 'cause this came to my attention.

772
00:57:28,813 --> 00:57:31,107
It's a printout from a website.

773
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:35,068
Well, both First Reformed
and Abundant Life are mentioned by name.

774
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:39,072
It was a political event.
A Neil Young protest song?

775
00:57:40,073 --> 00:57:43,785
I was just respecting the wishes
of the deceased and his widow.

776
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:46,371
It was their instructions
for the memorial service.

777
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:49,666
At a toxic waste site
with the press in attendance?

778
00:57:49,750 --> 00:57:51,043
There was no press invited.

779
00:57:51,126 --> 00:57:52,961
No, this is just Mensana's friends.

780
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:54,296
It was a political act.

781
00:57:54,379 --> 00:57:57,466
And you and the choir represented
the Abundant Life Church.

782
00:57:57,549 --> 00:58:00,260
And the Hanstown site,
by the way, isn't even polluted.

783
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:02,054
It was cleaned up with EPA superfunds.

784
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:04,514
- Well, Hanstown...
- No, no, of course not,

785
00:58:04,598 --> 00:58:06,807
but just give me some credit, all right?
I'm in the energy business.

786
00:58:06,891 --> 00:58:08,267
It's my business to stay informed.

787
00:58:09,435 --> 00:58:10,519
Look, sorry.

788
00:58:10,936 --> 00:58:13,898
Reverend Toller didn't understand
the implications here.

789
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:17,334
- May I ask a question?
- Yeah, go ahead.

790
00:58:17,668 --> 00:58:18,836
Will God forgive us?

791
00:58:22,506 --> 00:58:25,050
Will God forgive us for what
we're doing to his creation?

792
00:58:25,134 --> 00:58:27,845
That's what Mensana asked me
when I visited him.

793
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:33,016
This... there's been a lot of loose talk
about environmental change.

794
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:36,103
There is scientific consensus.
Ninety-seven percent...

795
00:58:36,186 --> 00:58:39,147
<i>The man who says nothing</i>
<i>always seems more intelligent.</i>

796
00:58:39,772 --> 00:58:41,732
<i>Why couldn't I just keep silent?</i>

797
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,027
It's a complicated subject.

798
00:58:45,111 --> 00:58:46,028
Not really.

799
00:58:46,654 --> 00:58:48,239
I mean, who benefits?

800
00:58:49,031 --> 00:58:50,116
<i>Cui bono?</i> Who profits?

801
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:51,450
That's what I keep asking myself.

802
00:58:51,534 --> 00:58:55,663
Besides the Biblical call to stewardship,
who profits when we soil our own nest?

803
00:58:55,746 --> 00:58:57,540
- What's to be gained...
- Can we just agree to keep politics

804
00:58:57,623 --> 00:58:59,000
out of the reconsecration service?

805
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,711
- Yes.
- Yeah, but this isn't politics.

806
00:59:01,794 --> 00:59:05,631
- I mean, what God wants is for...
- Oh, you know the mind of God?

807
00:59:05,715 --> 00:59:07,300
You spoke to Him, personally?

808
00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:09,467
He told you His plans for Earth?

809
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:15,849
Look, I understand, you're upset.

810
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:20,812
I mean, you found the body, correct?

811
00:59:22,314 --> 00:59:23,231
Yes.

812
00:59:24,755 --> 00:59:25,672
How?

813
00:59:32,012 --> 00:59:34,514
I was supposed to meet him.

814
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:40,603
And he texted me and... a change of location.

815
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:42,063
And?

816
00:59:44,565 --> 00:59:45,983
And I went there and he was dead.

817
00:59:50,029 --> 00:59:51,614
So you counseled him, Reverend?

818
00:59:53,282 --> 00:59:54,200
Yes.

819
00:59:54,825 --> 00:59:57,870
You counseled him, then he shot himself?

820
00:59:58,662 --> 00:59:59,580
Ed?

821
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:02,583
Yes.

822
01:00:05,961 --> 01:00:07,880
Well, I think you need
to step back, Reverend,

823
01:00:09,090 --> 01:00:11,842
and take a look at your own life
before you criticize others.

824
01:00:13,051 --> 01:00:13,968
Hmm?

825
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,327
<i>Mary and I rode the park trail.</i>

826
01:00:38,579 --> 01:00:41,707
<i>I had not ridden a bicycle,
I think, in 20 years.</i>

827
01:00:47,582 --> 01:00:49,084
<i>I was afraid I would fall.</i>

828
01:00:55,549 --> 01:00:59,052
<i>It's amazing the simple,
curative power of exercise.</i>

829
01:01:04,933 --> 01:01:06,143
<i>It's God-given.</i>

830
01:01:14,484 --> 01:01:15,860
Thank you again.

831
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:19,947
Michael and I used to cycle twice a week
and I've missed it so much.

832
01:01:20,031 --> 01:01:21,490
Oh, I enjoyed it.

833
01:01:22,283 --> 01:01:24,118
It's been a long time.

834
01:01:24,201 --> 01:01:25,536
But it was under protest.

835
01:01:26,704 --> 01:01:29,165
- I asked my doctor.
- Really? Still.

836
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:33,377
- Can I ask you another favor?
- Sure.

837
01:01:34,128 --> 01:01:37,214
Could you box up Michael's things?
Or find somebody to do it?

838
01:01:39,717 --> 01:01:41,510
You sure you want to give them
away so quickly?

839
01:01:42,219 --> 01:01:44,597
Not, like, not give it away, just, you know.

840
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,849
Just box them up.
It just, you know, I feel...

841
01:01:48,767 --> 01:01:53,730
it's just difficult to be around
so many smells and memories, you know?

842
01:01:54,105 --> 01:01:55,940
Yeah, I can... I can do it.

843
01:01:56,024 --> 01:01:56,941
Okay.

844
01:01:57,358 --> 01:01:58,693
Have you decided what's next?

845
01:01:58,777 --> 01:02:02,363
Um, the rent's paid for for two months,
so there's no hurry.

846
01:02:02,447 --> 01:02:05,325
But I'm gonna stay
with my sister and my brother-in-law.

847
01:02:05,408 --> 01:02:07,285
- Hmm, are you?
- Until the baby is born.

848
01:02:07,368 --> 01:02:08,828
So you'll relocate there?

849
01:02:08,912 --> 01:02:09,829
Yeah, I think so.

850
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:12,707
She contacted an obstetrician.

851
01:02:14,876 --> 01:02:16,169
Are we talking pink or blue?

852
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:18,463
- Blue.
- Blue.

853
01:02:18,546 --> 01:02:20,255
- Blue! Thanks.
- Ah, congratulations.

854
01:02:20,339 --> 01:02:21,465
- That's wonderful.
- Yeah.

855
01:02:23,675 --> 01:02:27,930
Oh, hey, I have a question
for you if it's not too painful.

856
01:02:31,934 --> 01:02:35,354
Do you think he really
would have harmed someone?

857
01:02:40,150 --> 01:02:41,068
Um...

858
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:46,532
He'd been a part of some...
nonviolent protests.

859
01:02:47,616 --> 01:02:50,327
We both had. He'd been put in jail.

860
01:02:51,577 --> 01:02:52,495
He had a temper.

861
01:02:53,454 --> 01:02:56,290
I mean, he'd start yelling at police,
but no, I don't think he was...

862
01:02:57,625 --> 01:02:59,293
No. I don't think he was violent.

863
01:03:02,630 --> 01:03:03,589
I just, um...

864
01:03:05,466 --> 01:03:09,137
I can't help but keep wondering
what I should have done differently.

865
01:03:13,391 --> 01:03:14,684
He didn't want to live.

866
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,482
He was not a religious man, you know.

867
01:03:23,775 --> 01:03:26,236
He didn't care for the church. That was me.

868
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:27,988
I was the one who asked him to come.

869
01:03:28,655 --> 01:03:32,200
I was raised in the church
and I never could quite let it go.

870
01:03:33,201 --> 01:03:35,537
I'd be in a strange city and I would just go

871
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,497
to a church and sit down, you know?

872
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:39,249
I was the spiritual one.

873
01:03:45,172 --> 01:03:46,089
Thanks.

874
01:03:46,715 --> 01:03:50,177
Yeah, I'll... I'm gonna go get some boxes.

875
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,595
- I'll come back for the clothes.
- Okay.

876
01:03:55,806 --> 01:03:57,308
Reverend? Um...

877
01:04:00,394 --> 01:04:02,980
would you... pray with me?

878
01:04:05,608 --> 01:04:07,651
I just... I find it difficult to do it alone.

879
01:04:07,735 --> 01:04:10,487
Just, the words just don't come.

880
01:04:12,573 --> 01:04:14,074
Are you uncomfortable
with me asking you that?

881
01:04:14,158 --> 01:04:17,119
- No. No, no, no. Of course not, yeah.
- Okay.

882
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:22,708
Dear Heavenly Father...

883
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:27,420
we invite you into this room,
into our heart...

884
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:30,673
<i>I held her hand, I spoke,</i>

885
01:04:32,008 --> 01:04:33,593
<i>and the words came out of my mouth.</i>

886
01:04:34,552 --> 01:04:38,473
<i>"By thy words, you shall be justified
and by thy words, you shall be condemned."</i>

887
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:45,124
<i>I can no longer ignore my health.</i>

888
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:48,544
<i>I have postponed my checkup too often.</i>

889
01:05:50,296 --> 01:05:52,631
<i>Yesterday, I could literally barely stand.</i>

890
01:06:51,021 --> 01:06:53,607
<i>No, I have not lost my faith.</i>

891
01:08:13,579 --> 01:08:16,540
"And the rich man said,
'I will pull down my barns

892
01:08:16,624 --> 01:08:17,950
and build greater.'

893
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:21,629
And I will say to my soul,

894
01:08:21,712 --> 01:08:25,215
'take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.'

895
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:27,384
But God said unto his disciples,

896
01:08:27,468 --> 01:08:28,928
'take no thought for your life,

897
01:08:29,595 --> 01:08:30,804
what ye shall eat.'

898
01:08:33,265 --> 01:08:36,352
Neither for the body, what ye shall put on.

899
01:08:38,979 --> 01:08:41,147
The life is more than meat,

900
01:08:42,565 --> 01:08:45,234
and the body is more than raiment."

901
01:08:46,152 --> 01:08:48,947
Thus ends the reading of the Lord.
Praise be God.

902
01:08:49,739 --> 01:08:51,282
When did he come back?

903
01:08:51,366 --> 01:08:53,618
Well, he was out most of Friday.

904
01:08:54,243 --> 01:08:55,870
So he went to Albany for his checkup?

905
01:08:55,954 --> 01:08:58,498
I asked him, but he didn't
give me any details.

906
01:08:58,915 --> 01:08:59,832
You know how he is.

907
01:09:00,833 --> 01:09:02,251
Perhaps I can check.

908
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,545
- Esther.
- It's just...

909
01:09:04,629 --> 01:09:07,215
I know. I know.

910
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:13,971
- Okay, all right. Bye.
- See you.

911
01:09:26,566 --> 01:09:29,152
We'd like to do a gastroscopic exam.

912
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:32,531
We lower a fiber optic camera
down the throat and esophagus

913
01:09:32,614 --> 01:09:33,532
and take a look around.

914
01:09:33,615 --> 01:09:35,575
It's an outpatient procedure,
local anesthetic.

915
01:09:35,659 --> 01:09:37,327
You should be able to leave by midafternoon.

916
01:09:37,411 --> 01:09:39,371
Still, that doesn't...
that doesn't sound too good.

917
01:09:39,454 --> 01:09:42,374
Well, we'd like to check
for evidence of malignancy.

918
01:09:42,457 --> 01:09:43,375
Cancer.

919
01:09:44,417 --> 01:09:47,169
Cancer's not the fearsome
medical foe it once was.

920
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:48,796
Mm-hmm.

921
01:09:51,549 --> 01:09:53,676
What's the treatment for that?

922
01:09:55,136 --> 01:09:57,847
It depends on how far advanced the tumor is.

923
01:09:58,931 --> 01:09:59,849
But?

924
01:10:00,099 --> 01:10:02,143
You stated you've been
experiencing discomfort.

925
01:10:02,852 --> 01:10:03,769
Uh-huh.

926
01:10:04,186 --> 01:10:05,604
- Yeah.
- Six months?

927
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:11,235
Well, diet, medication, chemo, even surgery.

928
01:10:11,318 --> 01:10:13,446
We have a variety of diagnostic tools.

929
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:15,281
Have you had any bloody stools?

930
01:10:20,785 --> 01:10:21,703
Recently?

931
01:10:24,789 --> 01:10:28,251
Okay. I'd like to schedule
the gastroscopy as soon as possible.

932
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:31,838
We have an open slot week after next.

933
01:10:32,881 --> 01:10:33,798
Okay.

934
01:10:34,174 --> 01:10:35,091
What's your diet?

935
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,093
My diet? Um...

936
01:10:38,136 --> 01:10:39,220
I'm hungry, I eat.

937
01:10:39,304 --> 01:10:40,680
- Smoke?
- No.

938
01:10:40,764 --> 01:10:41,681
Drink?

939
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:44,934
Mmm, in moderation.

940
01:10:45,018 --> 01:10:45,935
That needs to end.

941
01:10:46,686 --> 01:10:49,146
I'm gonna call in a prescription to help
with the stomach pain.

942
01:10:49,229 --> 01:10:51,440
And I want you to take
nutritional supplements.

943
01:10:52,441 --> 01:10:53,358
Okay.

944
01:10:54,359 --> 01:10:55,527
Are you in pain now?

945
01:10:56,987 --> 01:10:58,113
No, I feel good.

946
01:11:00,365 --> 01:11:04,286
<i>We tend to think that anxiety and worry</i>

947
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:08,123
<i>are simply an indication of how wise we are,</i>

948
01:11:08,749 --> 01:11:10,626
<i>yet it is a much better indication</i>

949
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:12,544
<i>of how wicked we are.</i>

950
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:18,675
<i>Fretting arises from our determination
to have our own way.</i>

951
01:11:19,717 --> 01:11:21,636
<i>Our Lord never worried</i>

952
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:23,763
<i>and was never anxious.</i>

953
01:11:25,431 --> 01:11:27,100
- I'll be back in a bit.
- <i>Because His purpose</i>

954
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:31,062
<i>was to accomplish not His own plans...</i>

955
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,069
- Reverend?
- Hi, Esther.

956
01:11:38,152 --> 01:11:40,029
I didn't know you were coming.

957
01:11:40,113 --> 01:11:41,155
Well, Joel's office called.

958
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:43,199
They want to talk to me about
the reconsecration program.

959
01:11:43,282 --> 01:11:44,283
Did they talk to you?

960
01:11:44,951 --> 01:11:46,494
I'll be at First Reformed.

961
01:11:46,577 --> 01:11:49,122
And Stanley will be with
the full choir here for the simulcast.

962
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:50,331
Mm-hmm, nice.

963
01:11:50,414 --> 01:11:51,748
The acoustics will be wonderful.

964
01:11:51,832 --> 01:11:52,749
- I mean...
- Stop.

965
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,000
Really wonderful.

966
01:11:54,835 --> 01:11:56,086
Did you hear from Albany?

967
01:11:56,169 --> 01:11:58,171
- Yeah, I did.
- Well, what did they say?

968
01:11:58,255 --> 01:12:00,966
- Nothing, just some more tests.
- A gastroscopy.

969
01:12:03,218 --> 01:12:04,136
And you know this how?

970
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:06,555
I called.

971
01:12:06,638 --> 01:12:09,432
- I'm worried about you.
- Leave me alone!

972
01:12:11,143 --> 01:12:13,645
- I just want to try...
- I know what you want!

973
01:12:13,728 --> 01:12:17,899
All right, and I cannot bear your concern,
your constant hovering, your neediness.

974
01:12:17,983 --> 01:12:20,443
You... you're a constant reminder

975
01:12:20,527 --> 01:12:23,445
of my own personal inadequacies and failings.

976
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:27,199
You want something that never
was and never will be.

977
01:12:28,117 --> 01:12:30,286
- Don't make me do this, 'cause I...
- Esther, Esther, Esther.

978
01:12:30,619 --> 01:12:32,371
Pull yourself together, okay?

979
01:12:32,454 --> 01:12:34,206
- You don't take care of yourself.
- Look at yourself.

980
01:12:35,416 --> 01:12:36,333
I despise you.

981
01:12:37,877 --> 01:12:40,212
I despise what you bring out in me.

982
01:12:40,963 --> 01:12:42,423
Your concerns are petty.

983
01:12:43,424 --> 01:12:45,259
You are a stumbling block.

984
01:12:58,354 --> 01:12:59,814
<i>I suddenly feel much better.</i>

985
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:05,403
<i>I awoke early, clearheaded,
and immediately set about my daily tasks.</i>

986
01:16:25,013 --> 01:16:26,523
<i>"The nations raged"...</i>

987
01:16:28,525 --> 01:16:30,018
<i>"But your wrath came</i>

988
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:33,772
<i>and the time for the dead to be judged.</i>

989
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:39,527
<i>And for rewarding your servants
and prophets and saints</i>

990
01:16:40,861 --> 01:16:42,655
<i>and for those who fear your name</i>

991
01:16:43,572 --> 01:16:44,824
<i>both small and great.</i>

992
01:16:47,576 --> 01:16:50,413
<i>And for destroying
the destroyers of the earth."</i>

993
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:57,420
<i>Revelations 11:18.</i>

994
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,362
<i>I have removed the previous pages.</i>

995
01:17:24,446 --> 01:17:25,905
<i>They were written in delirium.</i>

996
01:17:27,282 --> 01:17:29,367
<i>But I am determined to continue.</i>

997
01:17:31,578 --> 01:17:34,038
<i>It's hard to struggle against torpor.</i>

998
01:17:35,290 --> 01:17:36,583
<i>I must set pen to paper.</i>

999
01:17:59,855 --> 01:18:00,772
Shit.

1000
01:18:15,828 --> 01:18:18,289
- Oh, hey, Mary.
- Hi. Can I come in?

1001
01:18:18,372 --> 01:18:20,249
Yeah, of course. Come on in.
Come on, come on.

1002
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:22,627
Come in. Do you need anything?

1003
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,504
Do you want... can I take your coat?

1004
01:18:24,587 --> 01:18:26,797
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you all right?

1005
01:18:27,632 --> 01:18:30,760
- Um...
- Let me get this.

1006
01:18:30,843 --> 01:18:31,886
No.

1007
01:18:35,264 --> 01:18:37,558
I'm just... I'm really frightened.

1008
01:18:37,642 --> 01:18:39,227
I'm, like, I'm frightened of everything.

1009
01:18:42,605 --> 01:18:45,982
I woke up and my heart was pounding
and I thought, like, the roof,

1010
01:18:46,066 --> 01:18:47,984
the ceiling, was just gonna fall in.

1011
01:18:49,402 --> 01:18:52,030
- So I had to get out.
- Yeah...

1012
01:18:52,113 --> 01:18:54,074
And I just drove around and I...

1013
01:18:54,908 --> 01:18:57,160
I didn't put any makeup on. Sorry.

1014
01:18:57,244 --> 01:18:58,245
I'm glad you came.

1015
01:18:58,870 --> 01:19:01,998
Do you want some water or some tea...

1016
01:19:02,082 --> 01:19:02,999
Without warning...

1017
01:19:05,252 --> 01:19:07,170
this dark curtain just fell.

1018
01:19:08,255 --> 01:19:11,049
I'm scared of everything.

1019
01:19:11,132 --> 01:19:12,676
Well, you did the right thing coming here.

1020
01:19:12,759 --> 01:19:14,094
I just can't stop my thoughts.

1021
01:19:14,177 --> 01:19:16,221
They just keep going on and on.

1022
01:19:16,304 --> 01:19:17,429
They repeat and repeat.

1023
01:19:19,098 --> 01:19:21,016
Did this ever happen before Michael's death?

1024
01:19:22,726 --> 01:19:23,644
A little.

1025
01:19:24,853 --> 01:19:26,188
Yeah, not like this, though.

1026
01:19:27,815 --> 01:19:30,109
I read online that they used to believe

1027
01:19:30,192 --> 01:19:32,653
that pregnancy made you happy,
but now they feel like

1028
01:19:32,736 --> 01:19:34,655
it just makes your feelings more extreme.

1029
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:39,535
Michael...

1030
01:19:41,996 --> 01:19:44,039
he was just really strong.

1031
01:19:44,540 --> 01:19:45,457
How so?

1032
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:51,254
Um, he listened. He was kind.

1033
01:19:53,965 --> 01:19:57,135
We used to do this thing
called the magical mystery tour.

1034
01:19:58,303 --> 01:20:00,763
It sounds silly, but, um...

1035
01:20:01,889 --> 01:20:03,600
we would share a joint

1036
01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:07,103
and lay on top of each other fully clothed.

1037
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,816
We would try to get as much
body to body contact as possible.

1038
01:20:13,026 --> 01:20:14,402
We'd have our hands out and...

1039
01:20:15,820 --> 01:20:18,156
we would just look straight
into each other's eyes

1040
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,076
and move them in unison,
like, right, left, right, left.

1041
01:20:23,160 --> 01:20:25,871
And then we would breathe in rhythm.

1042
01:20:32,919 --> 01:20:34,171
You want me to do this?

1043
01:20:37,007 --> 01:20:39,259
No. I didn't mean that.

1044
01:20:41,219 --> 01:20:43,096
- All right.
- I mean, I...

1045
01:20:46,058 --> 01:20:49,519
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I guess,
I... yeah, I guess I did.

1046
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:51,563
Okay.

1047
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,606
Uh, show me.

1048
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:57,860
Well... you lay on your back

1049
01:20:57,943 --> 01:21:00,154
and with your arms
and your legs stretched out.

1050
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:01,781
Do we need music?

1051
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,367
No, we just listen to the breaths.

1052
01:21:05,701 --> 01:21:08,162
Just... lie down?

1053
01:21:09,205 --> 01:21:11,582
Yeah. And then, yeah.

1054
01:25:25,786 --> 01:25:27,288
Go, go, go! Come on, come on, come on!

1055
01:25:27,371 --> 01:25:29,498
- There you go, you got it.
- Come on, Benny. Come on, Benny.

1056
01:25:29,582 --> 01:25:32,960
Okay, guys, let's all get seated
in the first pew right here.

1057
01:25:33,044 --> 01:25:34,086
All the way down.

1058
01:25:38,924 --> 01:25:40,008
All right, good job, guys.

1059
01:25:40,091 --> 01:25:43,637
Okay, so last week,
we read <i>The Patchwork Path</i>

1060
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:46,848
about the Underground Railroad,
which was not a railroad, but...

1061
01:25:47,974 --> 01:25:50,310
- Rosa?
- It was a slave trail.

1062
01:25:50,727 --> 01:25:53,396
It was an escape route
from the South to the North.

1063
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:57,651
And this church, First Reformed,
was one of the stops on that route.

1064
01:25:57,734 --> 01:25:58,652
Reverend Toller?

1065
01:25:58,735 --> 01:26:01,780
Yeah. Slaves fleeing north to Canada

1066
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:05,575
were often helped, fed, hidden
by homes and churches

1067
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:06,743
along this route.

1068
01:26:06,826 --> 01:26:10,496
Calvin Verlander was the dominee,
the minister here at First Reformed.

1069
01:26:10,579 --> 01:26:12,706
And he was very active
in the Abolitionist Movement.

1070
01:26:13,290 --> 01:26:14,208
He assisted in...

1071
01:26:15,084 --> 01:26:17,169
No, Ms. Surya, let me try this.

1072
01:26:17,252 --> 01:26:18,796
Why don't you all stand up for a second?

1073
01:26:18,879 --> 01:26:19,880
Take a look right here.

1074
01:26:19,964 --> 01:26:22,341
Do you see one part of wood
that seems different

1075
01:26:22,424 --> 01:26:23,968
- than the other part of the wood?
- Yeah!

1076
01:26:24,176 --> 01:26:25,803
You all see that, don't you?

1077
01:26:25,886 --> 01:26:27,096
But does this seem a little bit

1078
01:26:27,179 --> 01:26:29,515
- like a secret door, hmm?
- Yes.

1079
01:26:29,598 --> 01:26:31,517
- Yeah, what's your name?
- Benny.

1080
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:32,643
Benny, will you give me a hand?

1081
01:26:32,726 --> 01:26:33,936
- Come on over here.
- Mm-hmm.

1082
01:26:34,019 --> 01:26:36,021
You see, there used to be a pew over this.

1083
01:26:36,105 --> 01:26:38,232
And they would move it
and then they would lift this up.

1084
01:26:38,315 --> 01:26:39,233
Can you do it? Help me.

1085
01:26:41,193 --> 01:26:44,362
Yes! Oh! Come around, everybody.

1086
01:26:44,445 --> 01:26:45,363
Can you hold this up?

1087
01:26:45,446 --> 01:26:47,573
Slaves would hide in here.
Sometimes whole families.

1088
01:26:47,657 --> 01:26:49,492
Be really careful. All right.

1089
01:26:50,243 --> 01:26:51,369
Can you imagine that?

1090
01:26:52,537 --> 01:26:53,454
In the dark.

1091
01:26:54,205 --> 01:26:55,415
The air hot,

1092
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:57,208
shaking with fear.

1093
01:26:57,291 --> 01:27:00,128
The sound of the slave hunter's
horses outside.

1094
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,006
On their knees, holding each other's hands,

1095
01:27:03,089 --> 01:27:04,632
praying for God to save them?

1096
01:27:11,431 --> 01:27:13,515
Do you want me to pack up
anything here in the kitchen?

1097
01:27:13,598 --> 01:27:16,101
No, I can get it later. Thanks.

1098
01:27:20,772 --> 01:27:22,274
I'd love to meet your sister sometime.

1099
01:27:24,276 --> 01:27:26,278
- You wanna come to Buffalo?
- If I'm invited, I'd love to.

1100
01:27:26,361 --> 01:27:28,238
- You gonna visit me?
- I would, yeah!

1101
01:27:28,739 --> 01:27:29,948
I'd love to meet Michael, Jr.

1102
01:27:31,158 --> 01:27:32,743
You've been such a help to me.

1103
01:27:33,869 --> 01:27:37,205
My great-grandfather
was a pastor in Muskegon, Michigan.

1104
01:27:37,289 --> 01:27:38,290
The Saint of God.

1105
01:27:38,999 --> 01:27:41,710
And the bank in town
was a two-story building,

1106
01:27:41,793 --> 01:27:43,378
the first building to have an elevator.

1107
01:27:44,171 --> 01:27:45,172
And one Monday,

1108
01:27:46,380 --> 01:27:48,799
Granddad got the boys all together

1109
01:27:48,883 --> 01:27:51,302
and they went into town
to deposit church funds,

1110
01:27:51,927 --> 01:27:53,054
as they did every Monday.

1111
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:54,889
And they needed to go talk to the managers.

1112
01:27:54,972 --> 01:27:57,475
They got on the elevator
and he had a heart attack.

1113
01:27:59,643 --> 01:28:01,812
And he took off his hat.

1114
01:28:01,896 --> 01:28:03,189
Apparently, he always wore a hat.

1115
01:28:03,272 --> 01:28:04,940
And he took off his hat and he said,

1116
01:28:05,024 --> 01:28:09,862
"Boys, take off my shoes.
I'm standing on holy ground."

1117
01:28:11,447 --> 01:28:12,364
And then he died.

1118
01:28:13,783 --> 01:28:15,743
Somewhere between the first and second floor.

1119
01:28:18,536 --> 01:28:21,998
Yeah, I think about that story
when I think about Michael.

1120
01:28:24,793 --> 01:28:27,504
'Cause I believe he was standing
on holy ground when he died.

1121
01:28:39,974 --> 01:28:40,892
Thank you.

1122
01:28:42,435 --> 01:28:44,104
So I'll see you in Buffalo?

1123
01:28:44,813 --> 01:28:47,023
I think I'm gonna go to the reconsecration.

1124
01:28:48,525 --> 01:28:50,692
Oh. No, you don't need to do that.

1125
01:28:51,235 --> 01:28:53,237
- But I want to.
- Yeah, but it's not necessary.

1126
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:56,365
Yeah, but you've been there for me
and I want to be there for you.

1127
01:28:56,448 --> 01:28:58,700
It's very nice of you to offer,

1128
01:28:58,784 --> 01:29:01,745
but it's just a bunch of rich guys
patting each other on the back.

1129
01:29:01,829 --> 01:29:03,497
- But you're gonna be there.
- But I have to be there.

1130
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,666
- So I'm gonna go.
- Please don't come.

1131
01:29:06,834 --> 01:29:08,043
Okay? I don't want you to come.

1132
01:29:08,919 --> 01:29:09,837
You understand?

1133
01:29:12,548 --> 01:29:13,465
Okay.

1134
01:29:15,968 --> 01:29:17,719
Right. Have a nice evening.

1135

Balq Home Products,
makers of paper goods, fertilizers,

1142
01:30:57,232 --> 01:31:00,026
everyday items for the household,

1143
01:31:00,109 --> 01:31:02,528
was among the first companies

1144
01:31:02,612 --> 01:31:07,283
to realize the need
to address environmental concerns.

1145
01:31:07,784 --> 01:31:10,119
Sir? Are you joining us?

1146
01:31:11,412 --> 01:31:16,000
This unit makes recyclable plastic markers.

1147
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:20,588
Balq has facilities
or production arrangements

1148
01:31:20,672 --> 01:31:24,509
with 18 countries around the world.

1149

1150

01:31:43,819 --> 01:31:45,445

01:33:40,390 --> 01:33:42,433
<i>I have found another form of prayer.</i>

1156
01:34:02,787 --> 01:34:04,038
- Reverend Toller, come on in.
- Hey.

1157
01:34:04,872 --> 01:34:05,998
Close the door.

1158
01:34:07,666 --> 01:34:08,708
Why don't you take a seat?

1159
01:34:12,838 --> 01:34:14,214
We're concerned about you.

1160
01:34:15,424 --> 01:34:16,341
Who is?

1161
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:17,717
How's your health?

1162
01:34:20,262 --> 01:34:21,596
Well, I'm having some tests.

1163
01:34:22,639 --> 01:34:24,766
Hmm? Have you gotten your results?

1164
01:34:24,850 --> 01:34:25,767
No. No.

1165
01:34:26,893 --> 01:34:28,061
What about your diet?

1166
01:34:28,645 --> 01:34:30,897
You know, I'm gonna be honest,
you just don't look so good.

1167
01:34:32,232 --> 01:34:33,150
I've had some...

1168
01:34:34,860 --> 01:34:36,111
some stomach issues.

1169
01:34:38,113 --> 01:34:39,905
And I understand you've been drinking.

1170
01:34:41,782 --> 01:34:44,326
Hm. What?

1171
01:34:45,244 --> 01:34:46,704
It's just a little wine with dinner.

1172
01:34:46,787 --> 01:34:48,205
- Wine?
- Yeah, yeah.

1173
01:34:49,915 --> 01:34:50,833
Well...

1174
01:34:51,917 --> 01:34:55,504
that's not recommended
for someone who has stomach problems.

1175
01:34:55,588 --> 01:34:56,839
I understand, all right?

1176
01:34:56,922 --> 01:34:58,591
I'll start taking better care of myself.

1177
01:34:59,800 --> 01:35:01,218
You're always in the Garden.

1178
01:35:02,178 --> 01:35:05,598
Even Jesus wasn't always in the Garden

1179
01:35:05,681 --> 01:35:07,349
on his knees, sweating blood.

1180
01:35:08,267 --> 01:35:09,351
He was on the mount.

1181
01:35:10,019 --> 01:35:13,521
He was in the marketplace.
He was in the temple.

1182
01:35:13,605 --> 01:35:16,816
But you, you're always in the Garden.

1183
01:35:16,900 --> 01:35:19,903
For you, every hour is the darkest hour.

1184
01:35:20,612 --> 01:35:23,114
I wasn't aware that I had offended.

1185
01:35:24,240 --> 01:35:25,909
Jesus doesn't want our suffering.

1186
01:35:25,992 --> 01:35:27,660
- He suffered for us.
- Mmm-mmm.

1187
01:35:28,244 --> 01:35:31,664
He wants our commitment and our obedience.

1188
01:35:31,748 --> 01:35:32,999
And what of His creation?

1189
01:35:33,583 --> 01:35:35,418
The Heavens declare the glory of God.

1190
01:35:35,502 --> 01:35:36,836
God is present everywhere,

1191
01:35:36,920 --> 01:35:41,257
in every plant, every river,
every tiny insect.

1192
01:35:41,341 --> 01:35:45,385
The whole world is a manifestation
of his holy presence.

1193
01:35:45,469 --> 01:35:48,805
I think this is an issue
where the church can lead.

1194
01:35:48,889 --> 01:35:50,682
But they say nothing.

1195
01:35:50,766 --> 01:35:51,767
The...

1196
01:35:53,352 --> 01:35:55,812
the U.S. Congress
still denies climate change?

1197
01:35:57,231 --> 01:35:59,650
Where were we when these people were elected?

1198
01:36:00,275 --> 01:36:03,779
The... we know who spoke
for big business. Right?

1199
01:36:03,862 --> 01:36:05,572
But who spoke for God?

1200
01:36:08,325 --> 01:36:13,622
"The creation waits in eager expectation
of liberation from bondage."

1201
01:36:15,957 --> 01:36:18,626
That's Romans 8:23. You understand?

1202
01:36:20,002 --> 01:36:22,672
So we should pollute so God can restore?

1203
01:36:23,089 --> 01:36:25,424
We should sin so God can forgive?

1204
01:36:25,508 --> 01:36:27,718
I don't think that's what the apostle meant.

1205
01:36:27,802 --> 01:36:29,303
I think we're supposed to look

1206
01:36:29,387 --> 01:36:32,223
with the eyes of Jesus into every living...

1207
01:36:32,306 --> 01:36:33,724
You don't live in the real world.

1208
01:36:33,808 --> 01:36:35,226
- I...
- You don't.

1209
01:36:35,309 --> 01:36:38,854
You are a minister
at a tourist church that no one attends.

1210
01:36:38,938 --> 01:36:42,400
Do you have any idea what
it takes to do God's work?

1211
01:36:42,483 --> 01:36:46,695
- I'm trying to...
- To maintain a mission of this size?

1212
01:36:46,778 --> 01:36:49,155
The staffing, the outreach,

1213
01:36:49,239 --> 01:36:51,491
the amount of people that we touch each day.

1214
01:36:52,826 --> 01:36:54,828
Who's that priest that you like so much?

1215
01:36:56,121 --> 01:36:57,831
- Thomas Merton?
- Thomas Merton.

1216
01:36:57,914 --> 01:36:59,791
- He didn't live in the real world either.
- Yes, he did!

1217
01:36:59,874 --> 01:37:01,293
- No. He was a monk who lived...
- He would...

1218
01:37:01,376 --> 01:37:03,962
...in a monastery in Kentucky
and wrote books!

1219
01:37:04,045 --> 01:37:06,047
Well, somebody has to do something!

1220
01:37:06,464 --> 01:37:08,341
It's the earth that hangs in the balance.

1221
01:37:08,425 --> 01:37:11,636
Well what if this is His plan?
What if we just can't see it?

1222
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:14,097
You think God wants to destroy His creation?

1223
01:37:14,180 --> 01:37:18,350
He did once. For 40 days and 40 nights.

1224
01:37:26,317 --> 01:37:30,154
Look, Abundant Life, we're with you.

1225
01:37:30,237 --> 01:37:31,405
Okay, we care.

1226
01:37:32,489 --> 01:37:33,490
We do.

1227
01:37:33,574 --> 01:37:38,829
And I know this is a hard time for you,
but we're gonna help you with that.

1228
01:37:39,997 --> 01:37:42,458
Once we get through
the reconsecration service,

1229
01:37:42,541 --> 01:37:44,460
you need to go to rehab.

1230
01:37:45,044 --> 01:37:48,005
You need to go check yourself
into a medical institution.

1231
01:37:48,922 --> 01:37:53,760
All right, maybe go to Nicaragua
and preach the gospel or build houses

1232
01:37:53,843 --> 01:37:56,304
but do something in the real world.

1233
01:37:56,971 --> 01:37:59,766
And if you can't do the ceremony,
I'll understand that.

1234
01:37:59,849 --> 01:38:03,436
You're expected to be there, but look, we can
just say that you were sick, which is true.

1235
01:38:03,519 --> 01:38:05,938
No, it's not... it's not about the ceremony.

1236
01:38:06,022 --> 01:38:07,398
All right? I can... I will...

1237
01:38:07,482 --> 01:38:09,484
I want to be there. I have to be there.

1238
01:38:09,567 --> 01:38:12,153
It's my church. It's 250 years.

1239
01:38:12,236 --> 01:38:15,031
I want to be there.
I want to introduce you. Please?

1240
01:38:17,450 --> 01:38:21,662
Well, Ed Balq has decided
that he would like to make comments,

1241
01:38:21,745 --> 01:38:23,372
so the governor will introduce him.

1242
01:38:23,997 --> 01:38:25,624
- Will that be a problem?
- Not at all.

1243
01:38:26,833 --> 01:38:27,751
Not at all.

1244
01:38:28,543 --> 01:38:30,128
Well, good. Good.

1245
01:38:32,047 --> 01:38:34,466
Listen, we'll get
through this reconsecration.

1246
01:38:34,549 --> 01:38:35,926
It'll be special.

1247
01:38:36,718 --> 01:38:39,429
And then we'll deal with these other issues.

1248
01:38:45,102 --> 01:38:46,144
Thank you.

1249
01:39:42,866 --> 01:39:43,867
Thanks.

1250
01:42:42,205 --> 01:42:45,542
- Where is Reverend Toller?
- I'm not sure, ma'am. Inside.

1251
01:44:12,292 --> 01:44:13,419
- Have you seen him?
- No.

1252
01:44:27,016 --> 01:44:28,517
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1253
01:44:41,697 --> 01:44:42,780
Toller!

1254
01:44:46,124 --> 01:44:47,785
Toller, you in there?

1255
01:45:13,644 --> 01:45:14,811
Begin the service.

1256
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:47,093
