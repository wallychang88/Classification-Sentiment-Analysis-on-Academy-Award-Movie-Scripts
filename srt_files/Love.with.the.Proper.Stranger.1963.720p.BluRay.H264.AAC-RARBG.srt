if you knew the name of maybe a kind of
doctor or something.

134

Come on.

145
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:57,520
What are you looking. We happened to pass
by you in the neighborhood

146
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,355
so what's so terrible to give you
a ride home?

147
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,524
It's embarrassing the fruit truck
alI the time.

148
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,650
Excuse me very much, your highness,

149
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,485
When I start hauling
vegetables in a limousine

150
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,362
l'II pick you up in a Iimousine.

151
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,914
AIright, I grant you that time
you went to the dance and everything...

152
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,498
you were all dressed up and everything.

153
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,500
I can see maybe you don't want
to ride in a truck.

154
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,170
But now you got on your reguIar clothes
in the daytime.

155
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,964
You're right, Dominic,
what can I tell you?

156
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,341
When you're right, you're right.

157
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,968
Go talk to her IateIy,
anything you say.

Drive, wiIl you, drive!

She won't run away, I guarantee you.
Miss skin and bones.

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,727
Going out tonight, Angie?

161
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:39,812
Why?

162
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:42,732
Nothing why, l'm making conversation.

163
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,695
AIright, who did you happen
to bump into today?

164
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,031
- What're you taIking, wiII ya?

165
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:53,618
Tell her, Julie, what happened.

166
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,579
We bumped into, what's his name, CoIumbo.

167
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,915
Columbo.

168
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,416
Columsy!

169
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,460
Is that nice?
Why do you calI a person names?

170
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,421
CIumsy, Clumsy. He can't turn around
without banging into something.

171
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,340
Who wouldn't be clumsy the way
you Iook at him?

172
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,508
Make 'em nervous.

173
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,511
Anyhow, we met him on the street.
Did we meet him on the street, JuIie?

174
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,929
Yeah, we met him on the street.

175
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,307
He said, "Now we're taIking, how's Angie?"

176
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,809
l said, "Fine."

177
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:21,104
He said, "Maybe I'lI drop by the
house sometime." I said, "Fine."

178
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,939
He said, "Maybe tonight."
l said, "Fine...

179
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,400
wonderfuI that you'd Iike to see him."
That's the whoIe thing.

180
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,902

if you don't stop with this...

181
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:30,113
What you telling me?
The fella's coming over to the house.

182
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,698
What shouId l telI him?
You'd hate to see him?

183
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,907
l'm not gonna see him!

184
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,204
So, why don't you like him?

185
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:41,165
A nice boy, responsible,
a nice little business of his own.

186
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,084
l Iike him, l Iike him. l love him.

187
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,378
He's Prince Charming, l'm crazy about him.

188
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,547
Hey, you! Don't party in the kitchen.

189
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,341
lt's a dance.
In a nightcIub dance, in the kitchen eat.

190
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,094
You can't keep him home.
This one Iooks like an old Iady.

191
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,805
Why does it bother you?
What's it your business?

192
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,724
If l wanna stay home,
if l wanna bIow bubbIes,

193
00:16:57,766 --> 00:17:00,101
I have a right to do what I like.
That's what l Iike to do.

194
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:03,479
Like? In America everybody wants
to do what they Iike.

195
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,773
But, what do they like?
They don't know what they like.

196
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,943
She's waiting on the story books, a
movie star on a big white horse.

197
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,529
Mr Charming. Boy, a prince, huh.

198
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,699
What does she want?
A movie star, she wants? On a horse?

199
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:16,492
- Right, Angie?
- Exactly.

200
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,453
Is that alI right with you, Ma?

201
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,997
For me? As Iong as he's Catholic.

202
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:21,914
Hey, Angie.

203
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,417
BeIieve me, in the oId days
a young person had respect.

204
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:27,670
ln the old days, you didn't
have to like everything.

205
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:28,796
You did what you had to do

206
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,799
and if you didn't like it
you Iiked it anyway.

207
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,134
Take me, for example.

208
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,095
l met your papa, Bonanima,
on a Sunday, eh?

209
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,097
And on Tuesday you were married.

210
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:42,185
Yeah. And what did l have?
Such a terrible life for 32 years?

211
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,895
l hate to remind you about this,

212
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,314
but today is not the Dark Ages
when you were a littIe girI.

213
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:49,484
Oh, child, today is the Light Ages, sure.

214
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:56,157
Ah, questa CampaneIIa...
AlI right, vengo, vengo.

215
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,287
I'm not here. That's aII.

216
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,831
Angie! It's not nice.

217
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:08,669
<i>- Hey, look who's here. How are you?</i>
<i>- l was just in the neighborhood...</i>

218
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,671
<i>- Hi Tommy, nice to see you.</i>
<i>- How are you doing?</i>

219
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,591
Wait a minute, l'm going to get Angie.

220
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,512
<i>- Angie, wilI you come on out.</i>
<i>- Oh, for crying out loud!</i>

221
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,348
Can't l have any privacy in this house
even in the bathroom?

222
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,183
ls it gonna kilI you just
to say helIo to him?

223
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:25,436
- Dominic, I've toId you 400 times...
- What did you tell me, what?

224
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,648
- Hey, wiIl you get out there and...
- Get out of here!

225
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,608
Who could live your whoIe
life in a house that

226
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,443
never had a corner where
I could put a turtle.

227
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,237
To put or have a littIe turtIe.

228
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,072
Turtle, what turtle?
You want a turtle?

229
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,907
I want a room of my own, I want
to be able to...

230
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,409
What are you telling me about turtles? You
want a turtIe, buy a turtle.

231
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,829
It's my own fault. Its my own fault.
lt's me.

232
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,914
I'm a big girl, l'm making my own money.

233
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,291
Who says l have to Iive here
if I don't wanna Iive here?

234
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,584
And I don't wanna live here.

235
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,294
I'm gonna move out of this house tonight.

236
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,963
This time l reaIly mean it.

You're just in time for a cup.

Don't put a dent on that truck

00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,502
Poor thing,

252
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,005
WelI, they couIdn't, you

258
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,145
Would you Iike a piece
of cake or something?

259
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,396
No, no, l just came... Ooh!

Spero non Si ai brusciatto.

262
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,153
No, no, it's...

263
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,411
It's aIright. Una più, una meno.

264
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,540
- Angie!
- lt's nothing.

265
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,500
I'lI fix it.

266
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:15,379
So, how's everything in the
restaurant business?

267

Hey, Dominic, c'mon we go in the
other room and we cIose the door.

274
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:36,859
On the couch l wouldn't trust them
five minutes, but in the kitchen...

275
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,070

Andiamo.

276
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,743
Why don't you sit down?

277
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:48,996
Just... sit down.

278
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,211
If l sit down,
l'll probably break the chair.

279
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,339
I don't know what it is.

280
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,508
You oughta see me during the day, I...

00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,064
I don't know.
With this hand I'm breaking Iettuce

285
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:20,903
l just don't know what it is. All you
have to do is just look at me and...

286
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:25,825
What's the matter?

287
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:30,997

Go, be a mother in America. Day and

You take her here, you meet her there.

I care about you. Do me something.
I love you.

333
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,675
Don't love me so much.

334

- Hey, America...

How can I telI you?

336

Even if I didn't wanna do anything crazy.

337
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,850

00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,829
Rocky! Rocky!

512
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,344
Guido, go get him.

513
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,764
What're you standing there?
Go get him, go on!

514
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,562
That did it.

515
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,650
l can't even run anymore.

516
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,703
Brothers now.

517
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:53,374
Quarter to four we're gonna sneak out
the back way and get a cab.

518
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,152
WeII, we got the money,
in case you're interested.

519
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,713
Look, I'm gonna leave now.

520
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,218
You don't have to go with me.

521
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,388
l mean it. Just give me the...

522
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:51,599
address and tell me where
I'm supposed to go.

523
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:56,395
Sure, l'm going to let you go
up there alone, huh?

524
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,360
You don't have to worry
about protecting me.

525
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:47,071
Why did you go with me that night
in the mountains?

526
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,614
Do you mind if I ask you that?

527
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,869
Let's forget about that.
WilI you just forget about it?

528
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:57,498
How do I know why l did it?
I don't know.

529
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,334
I was just stupid.

530
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:04,130
lt was just a stupid experiment.

531
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,841
The hoteI is fuII of women,
I wind up with Louis Pasteur.

532
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,011
Oh, boy, how they build things up.

533
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,138
In the books, in alI the movies.

534
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,100
How the world comes to an end every
time the fIame of your Iips touches mine.

535
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,689
AlI I felt was just scared and disgusted
with myself.

536
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,320
Oh, reaIIy?

537
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:32,408
Look, he's insuIted.

538
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,619
Don't take it personalIy.

539
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,286
Thanks.

540
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,729
You uh... you want a littIe vino?

541
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:17,096
Man, there's been a lot of vino
under the bridge today.

542
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,931
Just think a pair of nights with a girI.

543
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,324
You know the girl at the park?

544
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,243
My friend the big guy's wife?

545
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:40,911
You wouldn't believe this.

546
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,456
She's two years younger than me.

547
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,499
WouId you believe that?

548
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,586
Man, I hate to come back here.

549
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,801
Listen, that girl and I, we used
to break a lot of bread together.

550
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,891
Now we Iook at each other and
we got nothing to say.

551
00:51:58,698 --> 00:51:59,865
That's what Iove is?

552
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:01,534
Bells and banjos pIaying?

553
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,453
How they brainwash you.

554
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,790
And here l spend my whoIe Iife
life Iike a nut, waiting for what?

555
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:09,750
A stranger.

556
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,587
Listen, it's possible.

557
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,382
Don't teIl me you beIieve that.

558
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,008
WeIl, it's a known chemical fact.

559
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:20,010
Some people, you just have to look at them.
It's kind of kicky.

560
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:22,179
With other peopIe, chopped Iiver.

561
00:52:25,392 --> 00:52:27,017
That's true, but...

562
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,603
How come...

563
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,106
You know, my cIass in high schooI.

564
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:34,859
HaIf a dozen kids,
they couIdn't live without each other.

565
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:37,278
They got married...

566
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:39,613
and almost everyone of them now...

567
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,825
either they're divorced aIready
or they're miserable.

568
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:47,538
WelI, let's face it. Ever
take a cIose Iook at a married man?

569
00:52:48,331 --> 00:52:49,582
Prisoner of Zenda.

570
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,586
Not everybody.

571
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,963
Nine times out of ten.

572
00:52:58,884 --> 00:53:00,217
Maybe.

573
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:01,886
l don't know.

574
00:53:02,262 --> 00:53:05,097
I used to try to pick out the peopIe
who Iived alone, you know,

575
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,932
in the subway, in the street...

576
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:12,062
and almost everytime they had those...
I don't know, gIassy eyes.

577
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:13,856
Nothing's Iiving in them.

578
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,984
Like?

579
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,486
l don't know.

580
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:21,697
Dead.

581
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,122
What are you looking at me for?

582
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,916
Do l look dead to you?

583
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,257
CouIdn't resist it.

584
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,105
l don't know.

585
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,593
Hey, you wanna see something?

586
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,430
Hey, come here.

587
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,354
- ls that you?
- Yeah, you Iike that haircut?

588
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,274
l kinda Iike the haircut,
but those knickers...

589
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,317
Hey, hey, I was a very cool cat.

590
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,615
lt seems very funny putting
you together with a family somehow.

591
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,410
What did you think,
l got hatched out of an egg?

592
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:52,496
The way they love you.

593
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,206
What are you taIking about love?

594
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:56,750
What's love about it?
They're glad to see me?

595
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,335
They haven't seen me for a Iong time.

596
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,545
Let me hang around here
for a couple of months,

597
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,922
I'lI melt right into the waIIpaper
just Iike everybody eIse.

598
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,511
Love, huh?

599
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,250
That's what makes it rough.

600
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,169
When they Iove you.

601
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:50,377
Come in.

602
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,172
Come on.

603
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:05,100
Come on.

604
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,273
- Move.
- Come on.

605
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,908
Hey, buddy, wait.
You have to wait out here now.

606
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,580
Come on, hurry up.

607
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,623
Get undressed.

608
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,742
WelI, come on.

609
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:56,878
Take it easy.

610
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,680
Are you a doctor?

611
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:07,848
You said a doctor.

612
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,100
Take it or leave it.

613
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:15,981
Come on, get your clothes on.

614
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:19,025
Get your cIothes on.
We're gonna get out of here.

615
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:20,527
Come on.

616
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,904
Come on!
Get your cIothes...

617
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,490
Come on, get your clothes on and...

618
01:02:25,825 --> 01:02:27,159
Come on...

619
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:29,411
Come on... get your cIothes on.

620
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:32,706
Get your cIothes on. C'mon.
l want you to get out of here.

621
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,292
Get your cIothes on. Now!

622
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,960
Get your...

623
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:40,005
Oh, God...
Get your cIothes on now.

624
01:02:40,006 --> 01:02:41,506
No...

625
01:02:41,549 --> 01:02:44,426
No, no, no, no!

626
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,598
I'lI kilI them before l Iet them touch you.

627
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,475
I'II kiII them...

628
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:30,365
lt's okay,
it's a friend of mine's apartment.

629
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,284
He works nights.

630
01:04:35,288 --> 01:04:36,788
You need some rest.

631
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,742
Hi.

632
01:08:30,314 --> 01:08:32,482
Now knock it off.
It's been a rough morning.

633
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,942
AIright, now. Here, eat.

634
01:08:34,151 --> 01:08:35,610
No, no, no, that's not yours. Here.

635
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,821
No, no, here's yours.

636
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,409
Don't you beIieve in knocking?

637
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,994
What are you doing here?

638
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,122
Paying the rent, for one thing.

639
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:50,083
Which brings me to a Iittle Orphan Annie
you parked here.

640
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,835
lncidentalIy, without my permission.

641
01:08:51,919 --> 01:08:55,296
Number one, which I wouId not give you,
number two over my dead body.

642
01:08:55,297 --> 01:08:57,006
Take it easy, wiII you?
I want you to meet a friend of mine.

643
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:59,634
Dominic Rossini, Barbie MargoIies

644
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,511
I'm sorry we kinda busted in on you
Iike this.

645
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,888
- Oh...
- Where's the girl?

646
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,521
Honey, would you put some coffee on, hm?

647
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,667
WeII, it's a IoveIy day, isn't it?

648
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,252
- AngeIa...
- I gotta taIk...

649
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:38,715
I have to telI you, Angie, l...

650
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,217
When he toId me my whoIe stomach
turned over on me.

651
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:44,762
I mean it. I'lI teIl you the truth,
I can't believe it.

652
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:48,975
Anyhow, we had a Iong taIk.

653
01:09:49,310 --> 01:09:51,269
And the thing is,
he came to me Iike a man.

654
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,813
And he's wiIIing to marry you.

655
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:04,240
Why?

656
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:07,243
l know you're embarrassed
by the stupid way he put it, but...

657
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:09,162
I'm not embarrassed. I'd Iike to know.

658
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,247
- What do you mean stupid?
- Stupid, you're stupid.

659
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:13,750
- You're calIing me stupid?
- Why don't you cooI it?

660
01:10:13,792 --> 01:10:15,168
WiII you stop that?

661
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,921
Sit down.
The both of you.

662
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,424
The both of you, wiIl you sit down?

663
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,266
Do you want to get married?

664
01:10:32,394 --> 01:10:33,686
l said I wouId, didn't I?

665
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,521
That's not what I asked you.

666
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:37,941
Well, who wants to get married?

667
01:10:39,526 --> 01:10:42,612
You mean, even though you
don't wanna marry me...

668
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,864
you're wilIing to do it anyway?

669
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:47,075
Well...

670
01:10:47,117 --> 01:10:50,453
l'm just as much to blame as you are.

671
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:54,791
More, it was my fauIt the whoIe thing and
I'm willing to take my medicine.

672
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,213
That's reaIly wonderfuI.

673
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:05,927
And I'm the medicine, right?

674
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,181
I know this may come as a great big shock
to the both of you...

675
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:13,434
but underneath aII this hair and skin
is a human girl.

676
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:15,186
With alI the reguIar things going for me.

677
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,229
And, believe it or not,

678
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:19,857
I don't wanna spend the rest of my Iife
married to a man who's doing me a big favor.

679
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,987
- What did I say?
- What are you taIking about?

680
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,989
AIright, l made one mistake.

681
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,115
And it was a beaut.

682
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,243
But that doesn't mean I have to ruin
my whole life, and his, and the baby's.

683
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:32,662
The man is wiIIing to marry you.
What do you want?

684
01:11:37,334 --> 01:11:39,502
l don't want to be a warden all my life.

685
01:11:40,754 --> 01:11:42,422
The Prisoner of Zenda?

686
01:11:43,257 --> 01:11:44,299
Look...

687
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,759
I appreciate what you're wiIIing to do.

688
01:11:47,386 --> 01:11:48,511
l mean that.

689
01:11:49,013 --> 01:11:50,013
I realIy mean it.

690
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,267
But as long as you feel Iike
being married is being in jail

691
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:57,437
then you wouIdn't be happy, right?

692
01:11:59,732 --> 01:12:01,774
So, if you're not happy,
then you take it out on me.

693
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:03,443
And then l'm not happy.

694
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:06,571
And if you're not happy, and I'm not
happy, then the baby's not happy.

695
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,908
So, who needs a whole house
fuIl of unhappy people?

696
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:11,951
Where are you going?

697
01:12:12,244 --> 01:12:14,370
l don't know. I gotta get out of here.
I'm gonna be Iate for work.

698
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:16,789
WeII, look, you wanna here me say
l wanna get married?

699
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:18,416
Alright.

700
01:12:19,626 --> 01:12:21,586
I wanna get married.

701
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:28,593
l'm only trying to be honest with you.

702
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:33,431
TeII the truth.

703
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:37,685
lf I said okay, your teeth wouId fall out.

704
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,441
Right or wrong?

705
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:00,958
Dominic, I realIy owe you an apology,
you know.

706
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,335
l reaIly do.

707
01:13:03,128 --> 01:13:05,213
AIl this time I've been bIaming you
for everything.

708
01:13:05,464 --> 01:13:07,924
You ruining my life and aII that.

709
01:13:09,009 --> 01:13:10,009
Well, that's over now.

710
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,054
You know why I've never been abIe
to Ieave home?

711
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:14,680
l just suddenly figured it out.

712
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,391
Very compIicated.

713
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:17,892
I was scared.

714
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,812
And I'm not scared anymore.

715
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:24,399
I'm terrified. Funny?

716
01:13:26,235 --> 01:13:28,069
Well, Iisten.

717
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:32,698
Thank you Barbie for the use
of the Teddy bear.

718
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,463
Coffee anyone?

719
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:56,973
I understand how you feel Mrs Rossini.

720
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,684
But in this country it
isn't considered unusuaI

721
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:02,228
for a girI to want an apartment of her own.

722
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:05,022
WeII, you see, Father there's a Iittle more
to it than just wanting an apartment...

723
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,483
Oh, sure, tell him. TeII the whole world.
Why don't you put it in the paper.

724
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,318
Mama, we asked him to come here
to help.

725
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:10,445
He's a priest, Ma.

726
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,905
ln the church he's a priest. In my house
he don't have to know everything.

727
01:14:12,906 --> 01:14:16,451
- Alright, mama, you rest now.
- Yes, yes, in my grave I'm gonna rest.

728
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:27,295
In my grave l'm gonna rest.
Hey, don't forget...

729
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,880
What we're trying to do...

730
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:32,508
is there any way you can make a person
get married if they don't wanna?

731
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,886
There must be a law or something.

732
01:14:36,346 --> 01:14:37,430
Look, there's no Iaw.

733
01:14:37,431 --> 01:14:40,850
I toId you before, you can't force a person
to get married.

734
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:43,060
Look, I'lI bury you.

735
01:14:43,061 --> 01:14:44,770
Get him out of here.

736
01:14:44,813 --> 01:14:46,397
Get him out of here.
Not in front of the priest.

737
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:49,025
Get out of here.
Go out to the kitchen. Sit down.

738
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:50,818
You can force somebody to pay upkeep,
or something Iike that

739
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,695
but you can't force
somebody to get married.

740
01:14:53,405 --> 01:14:56,782
My son, often in this world you'II find

741
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:00,495
that the law of man comes second
to the Iaw of God.

742
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:03,164
- And the individuaI conscience of man...
- Look, Father, l...

743
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:07,793
Admit your guiIt, my chiId,
and face the fuII responsibiIity.

744
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:11,214
I'm willing to get married.
She won't.

745
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,800
- But didn't you say...
- She don't wanna.

746
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,928
I'II telI you what she wants.
She wants beIIs and banjos.

747
01:15:16,929 --> 01:15:18,471
- Banjos?
- What banjos?

748
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,431
You want me to teII you something?

749
01:15:21,266 --> 01:15:23,893
What am l doing here?
l was wiIIing to do my part.

750
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,019
She didn't want me.

751
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:26,062
Right?

752
01:15:26,438 --> 01:15:28,189
Good Iuck. From now on it's your problem.

753
01:15:28,732 --> 01:15:32,235
- From now on it's your problem.
- Hey, wait a minute.

754
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,195
- Listen, just for a minute.
- No.

755
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:36,239
Wait a minute, just a second.

756
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,289
Hey, Angie!

757
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,375
- Hi.
- How are you?

758
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,793
Fine.

759
01:15:50,087 --> 01:15:51,754
- How are you?
- Fine.

760
01:15:52,172 --> 01:15:53,214
That's fine.

761
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:55,841
How're you doing in your Iittle room
and everything?

762
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,093
Who said it's a Iittle room?

763
01:15:57,177 --> 01:15:59,303
It's two rooms and a half.

764
01:15:59,930 --> 01:16:02,098
Mom's in bed, you know.
We had a doctor and everything.

765
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,683
I think she lost the wiIl to Iive.

766
01:16:04,268 --> 01:16:07,562
Dom, she'lI live.
Listen, I gotta run. I'lI see you, okay?

767
01:16:08,438 --> 01:16:09,480
Taxi!

768
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:11,315
Listen, I toId her maybe we could
have some Iunch or something?

769
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:11,857
What?

770
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,193
l said maybe we could have Iunch
or something, I thought.

771
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,611
I can't, Dom.
I got an appointment.

772
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,321
Taxi.

773
01:16:17,489 --> 01:16:18,489
Who with?

774
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:20,324
The beauty parlor.

775
01:16:20,617 --> 01:16:21,909
Okay, what for?

776
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,160
Hey, taxi!

777
01:16:24,121 --> 01:16:25,663
What you got?
A date or something?

778
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:27,373
Maybe.

779
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,083
Who have you got a date with?

780
01:16:29,209 --> 01:16:29,834
Taxi.

781
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:31,168
Do l know him?

782
01:16:31,878 --> 01:16:33,004
Where did you meet him?

783
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,506
Can't you tell me who he is, at least?

784
01:16:35,674 --> 01:16:36,716
Rock Hudson.

785
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:38,301
On a horse.

786
01:16:44,975 --> 01:16:47,727
So I'm Iucky l feII on my,
you know, wrist.

787
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:49,895
l know this Iady lives
on Pickney Avenue...

788
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:51,063
The cake is almost, you know.

789
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:53,024
And she was waIking down the,
you know, street

790
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,151
and she feII down and broke something

791
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,235
in her back something

792
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:59,322
and now she can't move both her,
you know, legs.

793
01:16:59,948 --> 01:17:02,783
Excuse me, I better see if the, you know...

794
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,619
Anthony.
Oh...

795
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,499
lf l couId see what I'm eating,
I couId eat.

796
01:17:10,792 --> 01:17:12,585
Oh, Mama, leave it romantic.

797
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,921
It's romantic enough.

798
01:17:27,934 --> 01:17:33,064
Excuse me, I'Il go see if
I can, you know, heIp.

799
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:38,486
- Hi.
- Hi.

800
01:17:38,737 --> 01:17:41,447
Hot.
Careful, it's hot.

801
01:17:44,868 --> 01:17:46,369
I'II do it.

802
01:17:52,876 --> 01:17:55,753
Did you, um, tell your mother?

803
01:17:56,129 --> 01:17:59,256
I haven't told her yet.
But I'm going to.

804
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,842
I'm gonna teII her what uh...

805
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:05,137
l'm gonna tell her about the uh...

806
01:18:06,306 --> 01:18:07,932
you know, the baby, and uh...

807
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,560
WeII... only... what I'm

01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,230
l'm gonna teIl her that I'm the...

809
01:18:15,315 --> 01:18:16,941
you know, the father.

810
01:18:32,332 --> 01:18:33,249
Get some butter.

811
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:34,959
- CoId water.
No, no it's alright.

812
01:18:35,794 --> 01:18:37,128
Butter, wiIl you get the butter?

813
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,005
- It's alright. It's fine.
- You sure?

814
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,968
- You hurt yourself.
- No, no!

815
01:18:43,969 --> 01:18:46,137
- No, it's nothing.
- You sure?

816
01:18:46,179 --> 01:18:49,348
- Yes.
- Sit down. I'Il heIp him.

817
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,517
No, l'd Iike to, reaIIy.

818
01:18:51,518 --> 01:18:53,018
I love to heIp in the kitchen.

819
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:55,521
What are you gonna heIp.
There's nothing to heIp.

820
01:18:55,522 --> 01:19:00,317
Both of you, sit.
All of you, you know, come on, sit down.

821
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:02,027
- Huh?
- C'mon, c'mon.

822
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:05,239
Too many, uh, too many cooks
spoiI the, you know...

823
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,284
the broth.

824
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:12,580
- Better have a doctor check that hand.
- Oh, no it's... Oh!

825
01:19:12,622 --> 01:19:13,956
Oh, my goodness.

826
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:15,875
Very sorry.

827
01:19:18,336 --> 01:19:20,880
Nine out of ten accidents
happen in the home.

828
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,174
It's statistics.

829
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,236
This is really a Iovely room.

830
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:47,114
You have wonderful taste.

831
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:48,616
What you've done to this apartment.

832
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,330
Okay!

833
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:56,916
I'm ready!

834
01:19:58,293 --> 01:19:59,335
Readier.

835
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:02,505
I'm uh... you know.

836
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,548
Anthony.

837
01:20:08,178 --> 01:20:11,180
Oh, it's beautifuI.
It's just beautifuI.

838
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:13,140
What's the idea?

839
01:20:13,308 --> 01:20:15,643
WeII, I thought that... you know,
Iike uh...

840
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:17,978
like the 4th of JuIy, huh?

841
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:20,314
Big joke, huh?

842
01:20:22,067 --> 01:20:26,445
Mama... when Anthony gets married
you wiIl not be Iosing a son.

843
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,864
Somebody wiII be gaining a cook.

844
01:20:29,950 --> 01:20:31,200
Uh, sis...

845
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:34,286
ColIege girI. Going to coIIege.

846
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:38,916
You'lI have to excuse my mother.
She's anti-education at the present moment.

847
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:42,127
Ever since I toId her l was taking
a course in Iove.

848
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:44,672
A course in love?

849
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,300
Not realIy, it's just part of a course.

850
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,344
l only say that to agitate them.

851
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:53,556
The concept is that Iove

852
01:20:53,807 --> 01:20:57,142
taken on the mature IeveI
as opposed to the uh...

853
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:03,148
erotic, or the so-caIIed romantic, with aIl
it's faIse conceptions, is reaIly an art.

854
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:08,654
And like every other art,
it demands practice and patience

855
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:11,615
consistent dedication and hard work.

856
01:21:13,118 --> 01:21:15,411
I believe that.
l realIy do.

857
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:20,249
WeII, of course.

858
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,211
Now, how can any inteIligent person
in this age of reason

859
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:28,507
make the most important seIection of his
Iife merely on the basis of some kind of

860
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:31,468
vague sexuaI attraction?

861
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,221
Of course.

862
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:39,184
I mean, if two people just start out being
nice to each other

863
01:21:39,352 --> 01:21:42,438
if they're just concerned about
what happens to each other

864
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
that's aII...

865
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:46,066
and they're just nice...

866
01:21:46,526 --> 01:21:48,360
then I think it happens.

867
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:49,612
Don't you?

868
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:53,073
- What do you mean?
- Love.

869
01:21:56,828 --> 01:21:59,079
I mean, what they calI being in love.

870
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:01,790
I think that love, actually,

871
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:03,500
as such...

872
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,629
is strictly a middIe-cIass idea.

873
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:09,632
And it is definitely on it's way out.

874
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,675
Yes, l think so too.

875
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:12,843
Actually.

876
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,971
l mean, I don't think that love
is something that you...

877
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:18,349
fall into. Like a hoIe in the ground.

878
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:27,024
Now, if a person is even halfway mature

879
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:31,946
when you consider the enormous
responsibilities invoIved in marriage,

880
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:33,864
you can't take it Iightly.

881
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,451
You can't.
Knowing that the future generation

882
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:41,580
is entirely due to the wisdom
of your procreation.

883
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:44,333
Of course.

884
01:22:44,459 --> 01:22:46,669
- You want the...
- Sorry.

885
01:22:47,379 --> 01:22:49,380
I just don't know what
is the matter with me.

886
01:22:49,381 --> 01:22:52,800
- I'lI get a towel... you know, wipe it.
- Don't worry about the dress, l'm just...

887
01:22:52,842 --> 01:22:54,927
- worried about the dinner table.
- That's alright.

888
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:58,013
We're only Iucky it wasn't, you know,
hot coffee.

889
01:22:58,056 --> 01:23:00,808
Oh, it's terrible. l'm so sorry.

890
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,191
She's not a bad-Iooking girl.

891
01:23:10,902 --> 01:23:13,195
But she's so cIumsy.

892
01:24:04,497 --> 01:24:05,664
Hi.

893
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:09,960
Oh, hi.

894
01:24:11,296 --> 01:24:12,421
How're you doing?

895
01:24:13,214 --> 01:24:14,590
Fine.

896
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,677
I was in the neighborhood,

897
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,096
so I thought l'd drop up see
how you were making out.

898
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:24,808
Oh...

899
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:38,447
So, how's everything?

900
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,365
Fine.

901
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,410
No, l mean the probIem.

902
01:24:43,995 --> 01:24:45,037
Fine.

903
01:24:45,705 --> 01:24:47,039
What do you mean fine?

904
01:24:48,166 --> 01:24:50,167
WouId you excuse me just a minute, please?

905
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:57,841
Listen, what time do you get off?
Let's have a cup of coffee or something.

906
01:24:58,635 --> 01:25:00,260
WilI you excuse me a minute?

907
01:25:00,512 --> 01:25:02,471
Well, what do you say?
ShaIl l pick you up after?

908
01:25:02,806 --> 01:25:04,348
Oh, l can't tonight.

909
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,517
Oh, yeah, AI right, weII uh...

910
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,728
Tomorrow then, okay?
I'II pick you up after or what?

911
01:25:09,896 --> 01:25:11,814
No, l can't tomorrow night either.

912
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:16,443
Oh. What do you mean you can't?
lt's a cup of coffee.

913
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:18,654
WelI, I've got a date.

01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,283
With who?

915
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:27,746
What's funny?

916
01:25:28,164 --> 01:25:30,707
lf I didn't know better, l'd swear
you're my brother Dominic.

917
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:35,087
Look. l just wanted to see you
that's aII.

918
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:37,297
See how you feeI and see
how you're making out.

919
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:41,468
So, fine, I saw you.
And everything's fine, so...

920
01:25:41,886 --> 01:25:42,928

921
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:47,724
Oh.

922
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:51,019
Listen...

923
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:53,063
Do you want to make it Monday?

924
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:56,400
Monday, what am I supposed to do?
Wait around untiI Monday?

931
01:26:28,725 --> 01:26:30,726
Don't you want to see my new apartment?

932
01:26:31,227 --> 01:26:32,311
You want me to?

You don't know where l live.

You Iook Iike a woman.

01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:02,961
How can you manage to make even
a compIiment sound like a slap in the face?

What did l say?
You Iook Iike a woman.

Who's fighting? I don't wanna fight.

01:29:23,441 --> 01:29:25,067
I don't know what it is.

955

First time in my Iife I come to see a girl
and I feeI Iike I'm 14 years oId.

956
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,447
Even when I was 14, I didn't feel
Iike that.

957
01:29:34,327 --> 01:29:36,036
They're beautiful.

958
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:37,204
Thank you.

959
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:44,961

- I don't.

01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,779
- Scotch?
- Thank you.

968
01:30:13,908 --> 01:30:16,159
Water, soda or tonic?

969
01:30:18,204 --> 01:30:19,746
Scotch and tonic?

970
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:21,248

Water.

975
01:30:35,763 --> 01:30:37,389
- Thank you.
- You gotta know these things

976
01:30:37,390 --> 01:30:39,641
if you're gonna run a
respectabIe den of inequity.

977
01:30:41,853 --> 01:30:44,896
Well, I'Il Iearn in my own little way.

978
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:56,700
You know something,
l'II tell you the truth.

01:30:57,368 --> 01:30:58,994
You're kind of okay, l mean that.

980
01:31:01,998 --> 01:31:03,915
l know you think I'm putting

Look, will you do me a favor.

983
01:31:11,174 --> 01:31:12,799
Don't pay me any more compliments.

984
01:31:14,510 --> 01:31:17,637
AlI I'm trying to tell you is
l think you're pretty great, that's all.

985
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,431
You didn't ask anybody for anything,

986
01:31:19,515 --> 01:31:21,558
and you didn't sit around
feeIing sorry for yourseIf.

987
01:31:24,437 --> 01:31:25,896
I think you're something.

988
01:31:27,899 --> 01:31:28,940
l mean that.

989
01:31:30,943 --> 01:31:32,611
And l just wanted to telI you.

The way you Iike it?

993
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,693
Delicious.

994
01:32:15,154 --> 01:32:16,404
ReaIly?

995
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:18,198
No, l mean it. lt's delicious.

996
01:32:24,163 --> 01:32:26,623
This is kind of a test run for me.

997
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,377
The man l'm going out with is
in the restaurant business.

998
01:32:30,878 --> 01:32:33,129
And so before I cook for him...

999
01:32:33,548 --> 01:32:35,340
Anything l can do to help, Iady.

1000
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:43,807
WouId you like some?

1001

Great, just great.

1005
01:33:23,014 --> 01:33:24,306
That's wonderful.

1006
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:31,229
Yeah, I'm fiIling in for a friend of mine
every once in a while over in Radio City.

1007
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:34,858
He's quitting the business, Going to
open up a used car lot in New Jersey.

1008
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,028
Said I could have a job there
if l wanted to.

1009
01:33:39,071 --> 01:33:40,196
Permanently.

1010
01:33:42,366 --> 01:33:45,160
ReaIIy.
That's wonderful.

1011
01:33:45,202 --> 01:33:46,244
WonderfuI?

1012
01:33:46,579 --> 01:33:50,624
Five days a week, rain or shine,
in sickness or heaIth, who needs it?

1013
01:33:50,833 --> 01:33:52,334
I go where the wind bIows me.

1014
01:33:52,335 --> 01:33:54,711
If I don't wanna go to work,
l don't have to go to work.

1015
01:33:54,712 --> 01:33:57,339
And l can stay in bed aII day long
if l want to.

1016
01:34:01,719 --> 01:34:03,762
So wonderfuI. You're happy.

1017
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:07,974
Well, l am.

01:34:09,226 --> 01:34:10,602

Nice place you got here.

It really is.

l can see you put a Iot
of yourself in it.

1022

LittIe things here and there.

1023
01:34:34,502 --> 01:34:35,627
Very nice.

01:34:43,761 --> 01:34:45,220
And, you made it very nice.

1025
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:51,768
You know something?

1026
01:34:52,186 --> 01:34:54,354
If you didn't try so hard
to play against it

1027
01:34:54,355 --> 01:34:56,648
you could be a pretty decent
kind of a person.

1028
01:34:56,816 --> 01:34:58,775
Look how surprised she sounds.

1029
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:07,283
What do you think you're doing?

1030
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,703
- As if I didn't know.
- Come here, Louis.

1031
01:35:09,745 --> 01:35:10,787
Louis?

1032
01:35:10,830 --> 01:35:12,414
A new kind of experiment.

1033
01:35:27,805 --> 01:35:28,805
Look.

1034
01:35:38,441 --> 01:35:39,441
Don't.

1035
01:35:44,155 --> 01:35:46,656
You better understand something
here and now.

1036
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:49,826
What we did before,
that was something happened

1037
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:52,662
don't ask me how or why,
but it's not gonna happen again.

1038
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:53,705
Why not?

1039
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:57,959
Don't you understand?

1040
01:35:58,002 --> 01:36:00,587
I didn't know you then.
I didn't care about you.

1041
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:03,298
But, l know you now.
l like you.

1042
01:36:06,218 --> 01:36:08,720
Man, I end up with a...

1043
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:12,390
Look. Why don't you sit down?

1044
01:36:12,391 --> 01:36:14,476
I invited you to dinner.
Let's have dinner.

1045
01:36:26,947 --> 01:36:28,281
TeIl me something.

1046
01:36:28,824 --> 01:36:29,866
That cook...

1047
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,952
that friend of yours
in the restaurant business

1048
01:36:32,995 --> 01:36:34,871
Do you Iike him too,
the way you like me now?

1049
01:36:34,914 --> 01:36:37,874
Or do you not care about him the way
you used to not care about me?

1050
01:36:47,384 --> 01:36:49,302
What are you, some kind of a nut?

1051
01:36:50,095 --> 01:36:51,596
Thank you so much for dropping in.

1052
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:53,681
I'm sorry you had to Ieave so earIy.

1053
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:57,602
Look, l'm sorry. l'm sorry.
I didn't mean... I made a bad joke.

1054
01:36:57,603 --> 01:36:59,145
Dead, dead. You're dead.

1055
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,105
- Wait a minute. WiIl you just Iisten.
- Look!

1056
01:37:01,106 --> 01:37:03,149
Look, l've got a man who
wants to get married.

1057
01:37:03,442 --> 01:37:04,943
And he wants to get married to me.

1058
01:37:05,236 --> 01:37:08,196
And if l don't hear the beIls and the
banjos ringing everytime I look at him...

1059
01:37:08,239 --> 01:37:10,281
l can just Iive without the bells
and the banjos.

1060
01:37:10,616 --> 01:37:12,492
Cause l don't hear them when I Iook
at you either.

1061
01:37:12,535 --> 01:37:14,452
- Listen, Angie.
- Will you get away from me, please!

1062
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:15,620
Just get away from me!

1063
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:17,789
And stay away from me.
I don't want to see you anymore, ever.

1064
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:18,498
Now, listen, we...

1065
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:21,042
Go, go where the wind bIows you.

1066
01:37:22,711 --> 01:37:24,504
Hey, Angie!

1067
01:37:24,547 --> 01:37:27,298
And if you think you're such a big prize
talking to every girI in the worId

1068
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,175
who's out to to trap you.

1069
01:37:30,052 --> 01:37:32,929
