1
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:17,617
(crashing and rumbling)

2
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,286
(ship whistle blows, distant)

3
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,289
(band playing)

4
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:16,202
"Happy maiden voyage. Mr. and Mrs. John Jacob Astor." Stateroom A-56.

5
00:02:16,236 --> 00:02:19,639
-Not so fancy as some. Only bluebells. -Have a look.

6
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,642
"From the woods of Windsor Castle." Blimey.

7
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:27,447
Devonshire cream for Mr. Benjamin Guggenheim. Drop it in the icebox.

8
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,617
"Happy maiden voyage, Mr. Guggenheim."

9
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:34,554
"Happy maiden voyage." They're in a blooming rut.

10
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:39,792
"Captain E.J. Smith." Deliver this to the bridge and hop to it!

11
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:43,296
"Mr. and Mrs. Straus."

12
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:48,468
(band continues)

13
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,870
(chattering)

14
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,784
(band playing)

15
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,606
With this lot we're taking on from the continent, we'll have 2,200 aboard.

16
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:30,476
Rather thick weather inside the harbor, but it'll be clear when you get out.

17
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,713
Cherbourg to New York. You'll go by the Great Circle Route.

18
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:34,948
Yes, by southern track.

19
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,318
A fine start, Captain. This is excellent tea.

20
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:41,888
As for your running time, we know you'll exercise normal prudence.

21
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:44,958
However, the company won't resent a record run on her maiden voyage.

22
00:03:44,991 --> 00:03:47,994
They're good engines, sir. We'll use 'em. Any other instructions from the company?

23
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:52,031
With a ship like this, there isn't much to be said, except good luck.

24
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,301
-And I wish I could go with you. -(laughing) Perhaps next time, sir.

25
00:03:55,335 --> 00:03:57,537
Yes, but that isn't a first sailing.

26
00:03:58,638 --> 00:03:59,772
For you, sir.

27
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,875
I suppose my wife dug up an extra shirt.

28
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:09,749
"From Henry Evans, Benbecula, the Hebrides."

29
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:14,787
Captain Henry Evans. I thought he was dead.

30
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,431
(chuckles)

31
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:30,570
It flew from the mainmast of the old Star of Madagascar nearly 40 years ago.

32
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:35,375
I joined as an apprentice. She was a fine sea boat.

33
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,510
Shall we hoist it, sir?

34
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,081
She's not top issue nowadays, but up she goes.

35
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:51,057
Mr. Sanderson.

36
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,532
(band continues)

37
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,610
CAPTAIN: Looks pretty good at that.

38
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,948
The tender is coming up from Cherbourg, sir.

39
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:18,785
Ah. Mr. Sanderson will go ashore on the tender.

40
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,853
-Will you show him to the gangway? -Yes, sir.

41
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,756
-Well, Captain, she's all yours. -Good-bye, sir.

42
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,000
(whistle blasts)

43
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,938
(whistle blows)

44
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:41,941
MAN: Mind your helm. Steady as you go.

45
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,377
(whistle blows)

46
00:05:52,151 --> 00:05:54,821
Julia? Julia!

47
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,025
JULIA: Sandy! I thought you were in Biarritz.

48
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,962
My beautiful Julia, to these ears Biarritz has become a dirty word.

49
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:04,897
(chuckles) How much did you lose this time?

50
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:07,734
These are borrowed trousers. Where's that husband of yours?

51
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:11,537
-He didn't come. -Good! Maybe we can cause a scandal.

52
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,806
I'm afraid that would be a little clumsy. I brought the children.

53
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,709
What about your summer plans? I thought you were taking a house at Deauville.

54
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:19,178
I changed my mind. Annette! Norman!

55
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,550
Sandy! (speaking French)

56
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:25,952
She means "hello."

57
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:27,754
-Norman. -Good afternoon, sir.

58
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:31,624
I have to go over to the right side, the starboard side to see the Marconi aerial.

59
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:36,929
Stay right here. I'll try to get a chair.

60
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:38,131
Oh, John, stop worrying.

61
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:40,933
I'm not the first woman in the world who's going to have a baby.

62
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:43,636
As far as I'm concerned, you are. I'll get a chair.

63
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:44,637
Forgive me, Mr. Astor,

64
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:48,207
but if you're looking for a chair for Mrs. Astor, perhaps my suitcase would do.

65
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:51,844
-Why, thank you. -Mr. Astor, my name's Earl Meeker.

66
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,747
-Yes. Thank you. -MAN: I'm looking for the Widener maid.

67
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:59,085
The maid of Mrs. Widener. Is Mrs. Widener's maid around?

68
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,920
The Wideners? I think I saw them over there...

69
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,922
I'm looking for the Widener maid.

70
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:04,824
I'm looking for the Widener maid.

71
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,593
Widener maid. I'm looking for the Widener maid.

72
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,395
Well, don't look at me.

73
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,999
I've got so many maids, some of the maids are taking care of the maids.

74
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:17,036
Can't say I blame the poor fellow.

75
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,206
I just haven't got the kind of a face that goes with the bankroll.

76
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,109
I'll flash my badge and blind a few people.

77
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:28,948
Name's Maude Young. Montana lead mines.

78
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,953
Seasick? That some kind of a cure?

79
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,889
No, it doesn't cure anything.

80
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:40,726
(ship whistle blasts)

81
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,032
MAN: No running, no pushing.

82
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,901
(speaking French)

83
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:51,604
Have your boarding tickets ready.

84
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:56,609
(man speaking French)

85
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,247
(man speaking French)

86
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,752
(man continues in French)

87
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,288
-(tapping desk) -I'm Richard Ward Sturges.

88
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,091
-Get me the proper man. I want to arrange passage. -On the Titanic?

89
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:16,028
-I have that in mind. -I'm sorry, sir. This first trip has been sold out since March.

90
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:19,599
My congratulations. However, I must be on that ship.

91
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,001
I'd like to help you, sir, but I'm sorry.

92
00:08:33,613 --> 00:08:37,817
(speaking foreign language)

93
00:08:41,787 --> 00:08:45,224
-Pardon. You are Spanish? -We are Basque.

94
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,295
From wine country. We go to California. Oregon perhaps.

95
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,697
Start grapes. Make good wine.

96
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:53,766
-You have land there? -We buy little piece.

97
00:08:54,133 --> 00:08:56,235
Well, it needn't be such a little piece.

98
00:08:56,802 --> 00:09:01,173
Now, you give me that ticket and there's enough money here to buy five times as much land.

99
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,279
(foreign language)

100
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:09,382
(woman speaking foreign language)

101
00:09:09,415 --> 00:09:10,550
Madam, there's nothing to discuss.

102
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,954
He can take the next boat and join you in a week or so. One boat's as good as another.

103
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:18,224
(foreign language)

104
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,626
(foreign language)

105
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,361
All right. I can always get someone else.

106
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,997
Now, just stop and think.

107
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:29,168
How many years would it take you to buy 100 acres?

108
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:35,107
Now, go into one of your tribal huddles and convince your wife.

109
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:40,880
(foreign language)

110
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:45,084
(foreign language)

111
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:51,891
-Thank you, Mr., uh... -Uzcadum.

112
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:54,160
You've done me a great favor.

113
00:09:57,096 --> 00:10:00,333
(whistle blasts)

114
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:05,171
MAN (shouting): Tender alongside. Prepare for boarding.

115
00:10:05,204 --> 00:10:07,173

She's mine. You get the one way back there.

123
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:38,037
Don't fight, boys. There's plenty to go around.

124
00:11:15,141 --> 00:11:17,243
I'm the steward assigned to you, lady. Just call me Giff Rogers.

125
00:11:17,276 --> 00:11:18,844
Carry your bag? Draw you a bath?

126
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:23,249
-Shouldn't you be in school somewhere? -(young men laugh)

127
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,387
Come on. Let's beat it.

128

Drinks and draw for the first watch. Hurry up, Dan.

131
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,436
Keep it honest. Keep it fair. Come on. Come on.

132
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,371
Well, chaps, here we go.

133
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,976
(laughs) Don't trouble yourselves, gentlemen. Lucky Lightoller.

134
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,912
-Same old story. -Done it again.

135
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,981
Mr. Murdoch, Mr. Wilde, Dan, remove your bottles. It's my treat.

136
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,083
With pleasure.

137
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,119
All passengers aboard. Stations for leaving harbor.

138
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:01,987
-Very good, Thompson. -Way to go, old man.

139
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,859
And remember: first watch, first man with the ladies.

140
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,994

Fire all boilers. Have a go, mates. Bend your backs.

143
00:12:22,174 --> 00:12:24,210
-Slow ahead all. -Slow ahead all, sir.

144
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:25,878

145
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,488

149
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,536
Full speed ahead from the bridge, sir.

150
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:54,507
(shouting) All right, carry on. Let her have it.

151
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,119
Finish stations, secure fore and aft.

152
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,088
Finish stations, secure fore and aft.

153
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,996
-All right, Mr. Lightoller, you may take her to sea. -Aye, aye, sir.

154
00:13:18,664 --> 00:13:21,367

156
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,450
There you go.

157
00:13:55,534 --> 00:13:58,204
Hey, you can't come up here. This is for first class only.

158
00:13:58,237 --> 00:14:00,539
Really? I'll do my best to behave properly.

159
00:14:11,217 --> 00:14:15,454
Oh, sir, Mr. Sturges, you don't remember me, but I was on the Queen Alexandria.

160
00:14:15,487 --> 00:14:17,256
Of course, you were. Your name is Emma.

161
00:14:17,289 --> 00:14:19,291
You have a daughter who's married to a dentist in Plymouth.

162
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,093
So considerate, sir, of you to remember.

163
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:23,128
Could you tell me the number of Mrs. Sturges's cabin. please?

164
00:14:23,162 --> 00:14:25,497
Yes, sir, it's Stateroom A-52, 54.

165
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,100
It's right over here. But they've gone up to dinner now, sir.

166
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,602
-Thank you. -Richard!

167
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:32,671
RICHARD: John. Madeleine, my beautiful peacock!

168
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,274
-This is a surprise! -Yes, it is.

169
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:39,178
John, I'd like to borrow a shirt and use your razor. I'm wearing my complete wardrobe.

170
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:42,014
-I left in a hurry. -Well, help yourself. Take whatever you need.

171
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,415
Thank you. One more thing.

172
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,186
If you happen to see Julia in the dining room, I'd rather you didn't tell her I'm aboard.

173
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:48,554
I'd like to tell her myself.

174
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:53,525
"Jean Pablo Uzcadum"?

175
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:58,631
(orchestra playing)

176
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,639
(chattering)

177
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,076
MAUDE: She didn't believe my eagle was real.

178
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,646
I said, "What do you want him to do? Flap his wings?"

179
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,613
(women laugh)

180
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:28,093
Mama, you should've protested. It's a really bad table.

181
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:31,230
There's not a person we know at this end of the room.

182
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,166
JULIA: Be brave, Annette. These tragedies happen sometimes in life.

183
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:38,037
Maitre d'hotel, where is Mrs. Sturges's table?

184
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,506
Mama, look!

185
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,249
Well, well! This ship is filled with nice people.

186
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,384
-Hello, Mr. Sturges! -Richard!

187
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:54,353
"Pommery, 1892."

188
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:58,657
Mrs. Straus, be careful of this old fox. He has plans.

189
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,461
-NORMAN: Father. -Norman!

190
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,098
-How did you get aboard? -By the back door. Good to see you, boy.

191
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:11,236
-Hello, Sandy. -Well, I can see a bridge game at last!

192
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,671
Mrs. Widener, George.

193
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,281
-Annette. -Father.

194
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:24,516
Julia.

195
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,020
You all look splendid. This is gonna be great fun.

196
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,422
I'll see to it that we have a better table tomorrow.

197
00:16:30,456 --> 00:16:32,157
Oh, Daddy, I'm so glad you're here.

198
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:34,293
I hope this doesn't upset your plans, Julia.

199
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:37,296
We might be a little crowded, but Norman and I can bunk together.

200
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,665
-It's wonderful that you could get away after all. -I managed.

201
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:41,834
My family will be pleased that you're coming too.

202
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:45,337
It makes it a better celebration already. Can I send a message to Grandfather?

203
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,539
They have a wireless place upstairs. The Marconi room.

204
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:49,475
Might be a good idea. Run along.

205
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,478
Nothing now. Thank you. I'll have a sandwich in the bar.

206
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,117
Annette, I wonder if you'd get a wrap for your mother.

207
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,284
Yes, angel.

208
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,489
There's something funny about you, Father.

209
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,625
I know! I've never seen you without a flower before.

210
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,535
Finish your coffee, Julia.

211
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:21,273
We can walk around the deck while I tell you what I think of this performance of yours.

212
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:24,343
I'm in no hurry to finish my coffee and not too interested in your opinion.

213
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,482
If I hadn't phoned the house from Zurich, you'd have got away with it.

214
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:33,685
Perhaps you'll explain now why you're kidnapping my children?

215
00:17:33,719 --> 00:17:36,188
-I'm not kidnapping them, Richard. I'm rescuing them. -From what?

216
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,123
-From you. -That was my guess.

217
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:42,161
This family reunion story is a deliberate trick to get them away.

218
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:44,363
It is, and what's more, they're never going back.

219
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,332
They're going to stop being rootless, purposeless, superficial hotel children.

220
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,102
-What's wrong with hotels if they're very good ones? -Oh, Richard, I...

221
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:57,276
Richard, please try to see this sanely. We're Americans. We belong in America,

222
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,344
And yet for years we've been galloping all over Europe

223
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,380
to be at the proper places at the proper time:

224
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,216
winter in Saint Moritz, Deauville in season, summer in...

225
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,353
What's the use? The same silly calendar, year after year. Look at Annette!

226
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,622
I have, with great pride.

227
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,893
She's entertaining. She's discriminating. She has grace and style.

228
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:16,528
She's an arrogant little prig.

229
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,566
So you've chosen to drag her back to the glories of Mackinac, Michigan.

230
00:18:22,201 --> 00:18:24,636
Any town in any state becomes comic on your lips,

231
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,738
but comic or not that's where she's going,

232
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,375
to a big, ugly, pleasant house with the cheap scent of lilacs around.

233
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:34,379
Oh, don't worry. She won't turn out dowdy. She'll meet dozens of nice boys.

234
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,684
I have something better in mind for Annette than being tied down to some lumber salesman.

235
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,085
I know what you have in mind, but it won't work.

236
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:43,622
I've seen a great many international marriages, and I've never seen a happy one.

237
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:47,626
-Do you think-- -I don't want to seem overeager, but could we?

238
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,661
Not tonight, Sandy. Thank you.

239
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:51,563
More coffee, Julia?

240
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:58,770
Do you think Annette is going to be grateful to you for hauling her into the wilderness?

241
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,608
In time. And as for Norman, I can only tell you this:

242
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,610
there's not going to be a carriage with two ponies

243
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,578
waiting for him at nine o'clock every morning.

244
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:08,947
From now on, he's going to walk to school.

245
00:19:11,683 --> 00:19:14,520
Hm. I should've anticipated this.

246
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:19,491
Twenty years ago I made the pardonable mistake of thinking I could civilize a girl

247
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,361
who bought her hats out of a Sears Roebuck catalog.

248
00:19:23,028 --> 00:19:24,463
I was wrong.

249
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:27,733
And don't think I haven't had my share of regrets.

250
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,437
One thing, Richard, you've...

251
00:19:33,405 --> 00:19:34,973
You've always been honest.

252
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,986
-Will this one do? -Yes, thank you.

253
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,857
-Where's Father? But-- -Never mind. It's bedtime. Come on. It's been a long day.

254
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,362
I sent the wireless, sir.

255
00:19:58,564 --> 00:19:59,598
Good.

256
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:07,506
Well, one game of checkers before we turn in?

257
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,740
Yes, sir.

258
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,657
(bell rings)

259
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,431
No more seagulls. It's a mystery, it is.

260
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,001
Take all the fish in the sea. There must be millions of them,

261
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:38,437
and you don't feel friendly towards a single one.

262
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:41,940
But put a bird in the sky, and you feel like old chums.

263
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,077
-(taps on wireless) -Listen, lad,

264
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,713
this'll teach you what kind of a boat you're working on.

265
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:52,317
"Mr. James J. Hays, on board the Titanic." When he gets to New York,

266
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,653
he's gonna have a whole bloomin' private train waiting for him.

267
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,722
That's handy. No waiting for a seat.

268
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,757
"Mr. Benjamin Guggenheim,

269
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:01,927
Countess of Rothes, Lady Duff-Gordon,

270
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,895
Colonel Archibald Butts."

271
00:21:04,396 --> 00:21:07,532
The ship I was on before, all we got was weather reports.

272
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,970
Yes, sir?

273
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,940
A form, please.

274
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:25,784
Hm. Must have broke the pencil.

275
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,819
Perhaps... Perhaps I could take it down for you, sir.

276
00:21:27,853 --> 00:21:29,888
No, no. I'll do it myself.

277
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,392
(George sighs)

278
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:37,329
Well, maybe if you would.

279
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:42,034
It's to my brother.

280
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,737
It's Mr. Frank Healey.

281
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,408
689 Boylston Street, Boston.

282
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,980
"I am coming home.

283
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:02,054
I think you should advise the family now...

284
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:06,758
that last week the authorities in Rome..."

285
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:10,862
"Authorities in Rome"?

286
00:22:11,897 --> 00:22:13,865
"Authorities in Rome..."

287
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:16,768
-I've got that, sir. -Oh.

288
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:20,405
Uh. Well, then let's say, uh...

289
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,777
Look. I... I'll be back later.

290
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:29,781
(door closes)

291
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:40,492
(knocks on door)

292
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:44,830
The bar doesn't open till 11:30. It's the rule on a British ship, sir.

293
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:47,632
I forgot.

294
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,775
-A cup of bouillon, sir? -No.

295
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,944
He's not interested.

296
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,582
That poor fella had no dinner last night and no breakfast this morning.

297
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:04,783
What ails him?

298
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:09,855
-I've seen that look before. He's a runaway. -From what, some woman?

299
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:13,625
No. He's running too fast for that.

300
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:21,700
What's the commotion?

301
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,203
Well, where I come from, this would either be a revival meetin' or a craps game.

302
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:27,239
Step up and get your tickets for the anchor pool.

303
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:29,775
Ten dollars gets you a chance to win 600.

304
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,643
Wait a minute. I wanna get in on this.

305
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,082
MAUDE: How do you play this?

306
00:23:37,482 --> 00:23:40,986
Just draw a number. If it corresponds to the minute we drop anchor, you win.

307
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:42,087
Five.

308
00:23:44,556 --> 00:23:47,092
Don't be shy, Mr. Straus. Draw a good one.

309
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,728
You draw, Mama.

310
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:53,031
-What's our lucky number, dear? -Seventeen.

311
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:08,780
Hey, Tom... Here you get it, will ya?

312
00:24:21,326 --> 00:24:24,963
Morning. They're selling tickets on the anchor pool down there.

313
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,766
-Oh? -Yes, I... I thought you didn't notice.

314
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,734
Maybe you want a ticket. I could get one for you.

315
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:32,270
-No, thank you. I'm not much of a gambler. -Oh.

316
00:24:34,739 --> 00:24:38,176
-How about some soup? Nice and hot. -Thank you. I just had some.

317
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,880
This is for Purdue. It's a college out in Indiana.

318
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:44,015
Everybody thinks it's Princeton, but it's Purdue.

319
00:24:44,449 --> 00:24:47,752
I see. Well, to answer your questions:

320
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,556
Her name is Annette, she's going on 18, and I think she's very pretty too.

321
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:53,325
Well, now that you brought it up,

322
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:56,328
-I think I kinda got off on the wrong foot with her. -Oh?

323
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,964
Yes, last night, when I asked if I could have the deck chair next to her,

324
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,932
she said she'd rather stand all the way to New York.

325
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:03,168
Oh! What's your name?

326
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,904
Giff Rogers. Gifford is a family name.

327
00:25:05,937 --> 00:25:08,273
My mother said one of us kids had to be called Gifford.

328
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,977
-Oh, I'm sorry. I always get friendly pop off the bat. -Sit down.

329
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:14,179
I'm on the tennis team.

330
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:17,983
The athletic association shot us over to play Oxford during Easter.

331
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,217
We didn't win a single match.

332
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,687
-Will she be at the dance tonight? -She likes music well enough.

333
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,789
Well, I better hurry and get my blue suit pressed.

334
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:28,760
(chuckles) Still the same. Young men hurrying to get their blue suits pressed.

335
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:32,197
Mrs. Sturges, I bet I can count on you to put in a good word for me.

336
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,205
"When I was one and twenty, I heard a wise man say,

337
00:25:40,238 --> 00:25:43,642
'Give crowns and pounds and guineas, but not your heart away.

338
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,978
Give pearls away and rubies, but keep your fancy free.'

339
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:50,715
But I was one and twenty. No use to talk to me.

340
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:54,119
When I was one and twenty, I heard him say again,

341
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:57,289
'The heart out of the bosom was never given in vain.

342
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,993
'Tis paid with sighs aplenty, and sold for endless rue.'"

343
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,629
That's pretty, but do you believe it?

344
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,168
I can't answer for myself, but if I were a tennis player from Purdue,

345
00:26:10,201 --> 00:26:13,171
I wouldn't believe it, not a single word.

346
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,896
A fine, healthy bumpkin.

347
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:42,133
-Are you breaking ground for Annette? -You're up early.

348
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:46,304
I had to scratch around for something to wear. Not a bad shop; they have everything.

349
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,873
-Dinner jackets, I trust? -Naturally.

350
00:26:48,907 --> 00:26:52,711
It'll be ready tonight. So... life can go on.

351
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:06,224
-JULIA: Good morning, Annette. -RICHARD: Morning, darling.

352
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,294
Oh, Dad, I thought you were a pot of coffee. What time is it?

353
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:13,398
Eleven o'clock. A brand-new day that's never been touched.

354
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,433
ANNETTE: I'm absolutely famished!

355
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:19,938
-That brother of yours, he never picks up anything. Where is he? -Where's my breakfast?

356
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,806
I sent him to order it half an hour ago.

357
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,077
-Beautiful! Lanvin? -Mm-hm.

358
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:29,881
-This one, Lucile, I imagine. -Yes, angel.

359
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,850
Your mother seems to have packed everything.

360
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,054
Of course, some of them will be a little out of place in Mackinac.

361
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:39,824
Still, plenty of practical things.

362
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,963
What? Only high heels? You'll have to have something to walk in.

363
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,733
Julia, as soon as we arrive, I think you ought to buy her some of those flat shoes.

364
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:52,003
They're called ground grippers, I believe. She'll need lots of things.

365
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:54,939
-That would be a waste of money for just a short visit. -Visit?

366
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:57,776
JULIA: Let's not talk about wardrobe and shoes now. Get up, Annette.

367
00:27:57,809 --> 00:28:00,345
As your mother has said, it's a brand-new day that's never been touched.

368
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:02,213
-(knocking on door) -Yes?

369
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:08,019
Ah, thank you, Emma. Those cheeks of yours bloom in the salt air.

370
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,988
Oh! Mr. Sturges!

371
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,056
Annette.

372
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,292
There we are.

373
00:28:16,995 --> 00:28:20,265
-May I bone your kipper, mademoiselle? -ANNETTE: Yes, angel.

374
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,169
-Is today the 12th or the 13th? -The 13th.

375
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,038
With the time difference, they should just be sitting down to luncheon

376
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,374
in that extraordinary room overlooking the fountains.

377
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:34,279
The dear, arthritic old princess sitting under the finest crystal chandelier in Europe,

378
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:37,182
and Mr. Paderewski complaining about the draft...

379
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:42,821
and at the end of the table, one young man next to an empty chair with a tear in his eye.

380
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,122
A crystal tear is my guess.

381
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:48,026
-What excuse did you give him, Annette? -I dropped them a note.

382
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,529
-Let's go, Richard. -What note? Was I to be somewhere?

383
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,867
It's perfectly all right if your mother explained it to them. See you later, Annette.

384
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,302
Wait a minute. Explain it to me.

385
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:58,837
What's the difference one party more or less?

386
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:02,974
Now, Julia, a luncheon at the Metternichs' is not exactly a wiener roast.

387
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:05,977
Was there some reason I wasn't told I was invited to the Metternichs'?

388
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,545
Annette, your mother's a sensible woman.

389
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,447
She probably felt something might come of it.

390
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,916
Some involvement with the young master.

391
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,420
To be perfectly frank, I was afraid. He's an arrogant little toad.

392
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:20,391
Mm. He does look a little like a toad, but he's a highly eligible toad.

393
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,028
Not many young men are related to both the Metternichs and the Rothschilds.

394
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,264
I don't think he looks in the least like a toad.

395
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,299
I see no reason we couldn't have left a week later.

396
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,335
I'm sorry I'm not there and I think it was mean of you!

397
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,402
RICHARD: Annette, mind your manners!

398
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:38,109
It wasn't a question of a week or two weeks. This was as good a time as any to bow out.

399
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:42,380
-Bow out? -Yes. I'm afraid so.

400
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,151
Adieu, great world.

401
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:49,988
Your father is saying that I'm taking you home for good. You may as well know it now.

402
00:29:50,021 --> 00:29:53,291
I won't see an arranged marriage, I won't see you jumping from party to party,

403
00:29:53,324 --> 00:29:55,827
from title to title, all the rest of your life.

404
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:01,599
Father, I want to ask you one question. Do you approve of all this?

405
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,537
Annette, I adore you. You know that.

406
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:08,439
Are you going to stay in Michigan for good?

407
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm a hopeless case, far too old to alter my preferences now.

408
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,552
-When are you going back? -RICHARD: On the next boat.

409
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,223
Whenever you go, I go with you.

410
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,362
As for you, Mother, I love you very much,

411
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:34,232
but my address is Paris, France.

412
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,643
Thank you, Richard. You were most helpful.

413
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:49,414
Now you see why I wanted to steal a little more time.

414
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:54,319
Please, Julia, let's not bicker since there's no love lost between us.

415
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,454
That's the tragic part, Richard.

416
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,991
There's been so much love lost between us.

417
00:31:11,135 --> 00:31:13,438
Hurry up! We have our first match at 11:30.

418
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:15,473
If it's not asking too much, what match?

419
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:18,109
The shuffleboard tournament. I entered us, you and me.

420
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:19,944
Good. We're the team to beat.

421
00:31:56,781 --> 00:31:58,616
-I'm going to dress for dinner. -Yes, sir.

422
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,352
You'll alter course at 10:00. It's posted in the chart house.

423
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,521
What's this note, "binoculars"?

424
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:07,091
-That's Murdoch's writing. We're shy on binoculars. -How did that happen?

425
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:09,727
I don't know, sir. We've got just enough for the bridge.

426
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,463
The lookouts in the crow's nests are doing without.

427
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:15,600
-Make out a requisition. We'll pick up some in New York. -Yes, sir.

428
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:24,208
-It's very nice material. -Yes, it's a beautiful suit.

429
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:25,710
I said it was nice material.

430
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:29,580
You did a fast job. Thank you. I better have a handkerchief.

431
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:33,351
Norman, it's time for us to pick up our ladies.

432
00:32:34,719 --> 00:32:37,221
-Norman! -Yes, sir?

433
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:40,725
Father, would it be all right if I ate in the cabin tonight?

434
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:43,294
Don't be silly, Norman. We're dining at the captain's table.

435
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:46,097
That's just it, sir. I'd feel out of place.

436
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,533
There's something bothering you. What is it?

437
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,503
It's nothing, sir.

438
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:56,341
(chuckles) Is this what's worrying you?

439
00:32:57,241 --> 00:32:59,610
Look, Father. There are two other boys on this ship.

440
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,714
They're an inch shorter than I am, and they have long trousers.

441
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,315
Norman, you're a worthless scamp.

442
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,284
You've been growing behind my back.

443
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,388
Mr. Webster, this is no way to let a young man walk out of your shop.

444
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:14,292
-It seems you'll have to put in some more overtime. -It's a pleasure, sir.

445
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:17,328
Your fitting, Mr. Sturges.

446
00:33:17,628 --> 00:33:18,629
Thank you, sir.

447
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:45,123
Mother, could you help me with this snap, please?

448
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,592
If you're busy, I can call for the stewardess.

449
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,761
That won't be necessary.

450
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:57,635
I love those earrings on you.

451
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,470
Thank you.

452
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,311
Are we going to cross the entire ocean in polite silence?

453
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,580
Annette, I'd be very happy to chatter like a magpie

454
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:11,516
if I could think of a single word to say.

455
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:18,389
-(knocking on door) -JULIA: Come in.

456
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:21,459
-Well, are we ready? -ANNETTE: Yes, angel.

457
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:27,298
-Julia, you look very beautiful. -I'm glad you're pleased.

458
00:34:27,331 --> 00:34:29,434
Annette, Norman's at the tailor shop. Will you pick him up?

459
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,569
I don't want to walk into the dining room with him.

460
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:33,671
Then you can trail at a respectful distance.

461
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:37,241
-We'll all meet at the captain's table. -Yes, angel.

462
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:44,182
Well, Julia, I imagine after a few hours, we've reached the same conclusion.

463
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,887
We scream, we shout, we hurt each other, but we calm down.

464
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,055
Things aren't so bad.

465
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:53,558
Things are never bad for you, Richard. You always win.

466
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,127
I don't regard this as a victory. It's an adjustment.

467
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:04,602
Before you go down and eat and drink, you'd better know how things are going to be.

468
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,806
I've given up on Annette. Her standards will always be the chic club, the best table,

469
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,776
the Royal Enclosure, and that's her decision. She's almost of age.

470
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:17,315
But Norman is still a child. I'm not taking any chances with him. He stays in America.

471
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:22,487
Now, wait a minute, Julia. What is this all about?

472
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,955
I should think it'd be perfectly clear.

473
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:26,491
I'm not gonna see Norman thrown away.

474
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:30,795
He stays with me and if you try to interfere, I'll be as common as you think I am!

475
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:33,464
I'll fight you tooth and nail. I'll take you to the courts!

476
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,769
Could you be common in a slightly lower voice?

477
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,472
I'll say it in any tone you want. I'll whisper, I'll write it down.

478
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:43,441
That's the way it's going to be! He stays with me!

479
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:48,479
You crazy woman. You're talking about the most important thing in my life.

480
00:35:48,513 --> 00:35:51,549
-I have plans for Norman. -What plans? That he should grow up to be you?

481
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,886
Possibly. I'm satisfied.

482
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:00,324
Is it so extraordinary that I should want to have some hint, some portion of myself survive?

483
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:04,428
Some portion of-- Yes, I forgot. "The best-dressed man of his day."

484
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,797
That's what they're going to write on your tombstone.

485
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:10,501
That may be all right for you, but I won't have it for Norman. He stays with me.

486
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:16,274
My dear Julia, I've been around enough bridge tables

487
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,843
to recognize someone who is holding a high trump.

488
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,246
Play it now, if you're going to.

489
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:25,917
We'll discuss it later.

490
00:36:27,952 --> 00:36:28,920
Now!

491
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:34,392
All right, Richard. One question first?

492
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,460
If it's about Norman, you know the answer.

493
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:37,795
No court in the world,

494
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:40,865
no power under heaven can force me to give up my son.

495
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,968
He is not your son.

496
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,652
(folk music playing)

497
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:38,923
(orchestra plays)

498
00:37:44,629 --> 00:37:49,100
-All I propose, Mr. Straus, is a small game at small stakes. -Oh, yes.

499
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:53,037
Don't act as though I were working the banana boats. I prefer good bridge and poverty.

500
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,040
-SANDY: It sounds rather like Saint Francis, doesn't it? -(people laughing)

501
00:37:56,073 --> 00:37:58,409
Excuse me. Mr. Sturges, there's someone looking for you.

502
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:00,478
-Richard, this young man. -Yes?

503
00:38:00,511 --> 00:38:02,813
At the door, there's a woman. Some name like Uzcadum.

504
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,682
-She's French, I guess. -Thank you.

505
00:38:04,915 --> 00:38:08,452
-RICHARD: Will you excuse me a moment, Captain? -I believe we've all finished.

506
00:38:11,722 --> 00:38:13,891
Do you expect to be long in New York, Mrs. Astor?

507
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,794
Hello. Your mother thought you might be in the mood for dancing tonight.

508
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,229
She and I got to be very good friends.

509
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,600
Oh, I'm afraid I forgot to mention you, Mr. Rogers. You'll have to forgive me.

510
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:24,869
My daughter and I were talking about something else.

511
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,773
-If Mr. Rogers would like a dance, I'd be delighted. -You would?

512
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,844
The dance floor is this way, isn't it?

513
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:36,547
Say, his is great, and the band's slicker than beets.

514
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,882
Wait till you meet the other fellas.

515
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:41,352
-We're going to have one dance. -Just one?

516
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,655
I was quite horrid to my mother today.

517
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,891
If I can please her a little by dancing with you...

518
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:49,393
as I said before, I'd be delighted.

519
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:51,729
Okay. What's the difference?

520
00:38:51,762 --> 00:38:54,665
If you get a good omelet, who cares whether the chicken likes you or not?

521
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:21,058
Keep going.

522
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,529
All right. Now, sign this too.

523
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:30,267
Both of them.

524
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:33,838
I still say, not right to sign this. I am not head of family. You--

525
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,875
Please, Mrs. Uzcadum, do me a favor and stop worrying. Here, sign it.

526
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,514
-(music stops) -(applause)

527
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:47,618
(music continues)

528
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:51,889
Now, you keep these papers. I'll send the steward tomorrow.

529
00:39:51,922 --> 00:39:54,091
Say... We're getting up a bridge game.

530
00:39:54,125 --> 00:39:57,027
Sandy Comstock tells me you're a player from way back.

531
00:39:57,628 --> 00:39:58,629
Yes.

532
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,904
(door closes)

533
00:40:15,012 --> 00:40:17,615
You need a topcoat, Richard. It's grown cold.

534
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:19,517
Yes, it has.

535
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:22,520
The Labrador current.

536
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:29,827
I wonder if you'd tell me, Julia.

537
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:33,864
Have I been the laughingstock of our friends all these years?

538
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,567
Does everybody know?

539
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,803
No one except you and me.

540
00:40:39,036 --> 00:40:41,639
Aren't you forgetting at least one other person?

541
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,842
Not even he. I never saw him again.

542
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,077
What very good manners.

543
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,216
There's no way for me to make it seem right.

544
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:57,054
It happened after one of those endless rows and private humiliations...

545
00:40:57,888 --> 00:41:00,991
in the days before you made me over into your image.

546
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,994
One of the summers we had the beach house.

547
00:41:05,029 --> 00:41:08,032
I'd left a party that night because I knew I'd cry

548
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:11,535
if there was one more reference made to my gaucherie, to the...

549
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:13,704
To the dress I had chosen to wear.

550
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,372
On the beach by our cottage,

551
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:18,209
there was a young man skipping stones across the water.

552
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,780
He assured me he was not a burglar, and we began to talk.

553
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:27,818
He said something admiring to me when I needed it most.

554
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,589
A pure, sweet, unsolicited compliment.

555
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:37,962
I... I took his face in my hands and kissed him out of gratitude.

556
00:41:40,764 --> 00:41:41,932
You...

557
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,769
You needn't trouble yourself as to who he was...

558
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:51,308
except that he was a much nicer person than you or I.

559
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,547
(purse hits deck)

560
00:42:13,063 --> 00:42:14,798
I think I understand.

561
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:20,771
From now on, Norman belongs to you. I shall make no claim.

562
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:24,942
Both of you will be taken care of decently.

563
00:42:27,077 --> 00:42:31,682
But I don't want to see him or hear from him or... be remembered by him.

564
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:35,886
-Is that really necessary? -I'm afraid it is.

565
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:39,723
As you pointed out, Norman and I began as strangers.

566
00:42:41,759 --> 00:42:42,826
So be it.

567
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,864
Oh, my poor Richard. How you hate me.

568
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:49,066
And for the wrong reasons.

569
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:53,370
Not because I committed an offense against common decency,

570
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,676
but because Norman isn't an elegant extension of Richard Ward Sturges.

571
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:02,179
For you, what happened isn't a mortal sin.

572
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:06,850
It is an inexcusable breach of etiquette.

573
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,722
Thank you, Julia. I stand reproved.

574
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,191
Good evening, Mr....

575
00:44:33,103 --> 00:44:35,239
Harry. Thank you.

576
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,882
I see you have your game.

577
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,985
And you're in it. Mr. Guggenheim's been keeping the seat warm.

578
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:51,255
Two no trump. A heart bid from there.

579
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,992
You can only play one more rubber, Mr. Straus.

580
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:58,896
-Whenever you feel like stopping, I can take over, sir. -My trick.

581
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:00,898
Do you mind?

582
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,318
Aldebaran...

583
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,222
you lonely star.

584
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:28,192
GEORGE: Look around at the others.

585
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:31,962
The friendly Pleiades are better off. There's seven of 'em.

586
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:33,764
Now, wait. Let me count.

587
00:45:34,531 --> 00:45:36,366
Answer up for the roll call.

588
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:39,970
There's four, six, seven.

589
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,439
They're all there.

590
00:45:48,112 --> 00:45:52,216
Have you ever noticed, my dear lady, that the stars are never late?

591
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,353
They made you cry,

592
00:45:57,221 --> 00:45:59,056
or wasn't it the stars?

593
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,229
Yes. Yes, I... I'm drunk.

594
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:08,999
I'm always two things: I'm drunk and I'm helpful.

595
00:46:10,067 --> 00:46:11,168
Thank you. I don't need any help.

596
00:46:11,201 --> 00:46:16,940
Then you're very, very unique. Oh! "Very unique."

597
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:20,377
It's a grammatical error. "Unique" stands by itself.

598
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,555
(hits deck)

599
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:35,058
Are you hurt?

600
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:38,829
(groans) I'm all right.

601
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:45,602
If... you would just be so kind as to point me toward the bar.

602
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,838
You're going to your cabin. What number is it?

603
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:51,608
My dear, unique lady, I am going to the bar.

604
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,178
No, you're not. Where's the key to your cabin?

605
00:47:14,264 --> 00:47:17,067
-I'll send in the ship's doctor. -No, no, no, let him sleep.

606
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,637
I've got some, uh, spirits of ammonia over here.

607
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,408
I'll get it. Sit down.

608
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:46,496
Take this.

609
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,166
Good night.

610
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,969
Thank you for being so generous.

611
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:54,972
-That's all right. Just go to bed. -You know what I mean.

612
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:59,977
Thank you for not mentioning my strange luggage.

613
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,012
Are you a minister?

614
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:05,649
A priest, or rather, I was until last week.

615
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:09,052
At three o'clock on April 8th,

616
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:12,656
my duties, my privileges as a servant of God were formally terminated.

617
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:16,159
It was this.

618
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,499
You know why I started, or at least the reason I gave myself?

619
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:27,371
A priest in a slum parish knows all the sadness of the world. He needs support.

620
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:30,974
So I used to lean on a little Hennessy's. Just a little at first.

621
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:35,178
People said, "Well, that's only natural. The young father has a bad cold."

622
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,413
(chuckles)

623
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:40,617
It got so I used to have those colds in the middle of July, lots of 'em.

624
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,487
I can hear the bishop's voice now.

625
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,490
"You prefer that stuff to your God?"

626
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:51,728
Well, God and I knew better, but... I couldn't stop,

627
00:48:51,762 --> 00:48:54,131
because I had a private devil all of my own.

628
00:48:58,735 --> 00:49:02,139
In Rome, they were very kind, but they were very final.

629
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:05,008
I was sacked, and prayed for, and sent off in the morning.

630
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:12,215
How do you cover that in ten words in a wireless

631
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:16,253
to a family that loved you and sacrificed for you?

632
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:27,764
You see, my dear lady, you're not the only one who walks in trouble.

633
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,004
Goodnight.

634
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:39,343
(door closes)

635
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:12,376
-Can I have some eggs, please? -Three minutes.

636
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:13,477
-How's topside? -(bell ringing)

637
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,379
Is that bridge game still going on in the lounge?

638
00:50:15,412 --> 00:50:17,114
I don't think they're ever gonna stop.

639
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,615
Time to relieve the chief.

640
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:23,854
Be careful of that coffee. It can stand up and walk.

641
00:50:23,887 --> 00:50:25,088
(chuckles)

642
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:34,698
Morning, Chief.

643
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,566
-Good morning. -Ready to relieve.

644
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,437
Steering south, 71 west. Speed 21 knots.

645
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,672
Twenty-one? Who ordered the increase?

646
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,107
The captain.

647
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,448
Jackson.

648
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,753
Take over a moment. I must speak to the captain.

649
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:03,593
♪ Holy, holy, holy

650
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:09,399

651
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:14,337

♪ Amen

658
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,552
The Lord bless us and keep us.

659
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:06,423
The Lord make his face to shine upon us and be gracious unto us.

660
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,828
The Lord lift up his countenance upon us, and give us peace now and forevermore.

661
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:13,797
Amen.

662
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,374
-Good morning. -Good morning, Captain.

663
00:52:24,407 --> 00:52:25,842
Lovely day, isn't it?

664
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,344
LIGHTOLLER: Excuse me, sir.

665
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,847
There's an iceberg warning posted in the chart house.

666
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,649
Yes, I know. I put it there.

667
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:34,885
I just wondered about our speed, sir.

668
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:35,952
It's a clear sea,

669
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,889
and our track takes us quite a bit south of the reported ice field.

670
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:40,924
-Anything else? -No, sir.

671
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,629
Er... Mr. and Mrs. Astor, I should like you to meet our second officer, Mr. Lightoller.

672
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,363
How do you do?

673
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,331
-He's worried about our ship. -Not worried, sir.

674
00:52:48,532 --> 00:52:52,969
I remember a man like that in the old days. Always afraid we were carrying too much sail.

675
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:56,640
But the wind never did us any harm. I like your spirit, Mr. Lightoller.

676
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:57,674
Thank you, sir.

677
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,882
-All right if I skip now, Mother? Big match coming up. -Yes, dear.

678
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,534
I believe that's your trick, Widener.

679
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,703
Are you leaving it there to hatch?

680
00:53:26,736 --> 00:53:29,573
(chuckles) Sorry, Sturges. I'm knocked out.

681
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:32,976
It's almost 10:30, Father. We should have a warm-up.

682
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:33,877
This may be a tough match.

683
00:53:34,144 --> 00:53:36,279
You'll have to find someone else, Norman. I'm busy.

684
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,516
-Yes, sir. -SANDY: An evenhanded rubber.

685
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,384
That's enough for me.

686
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,620
I guess it's time for us all to quit.

687
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,789
I see no reason for stopping. We'll get a fourth.

688
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:49,459
I'll be glad to fill in, Mr. Sturges, if it's all right with everybody?

689
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:51,895
Please do. Cut.

690
00:53:52,262 --> 00:53:54,864
The name's Meeker. Earl Meeker.

691
00:53:55,198 --> 00:53:58,535
All right. Let's have more coffee and double the stakes.

692
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,737
-How much do I owe? -We'll let you know.

693
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:06,977
Excuse me, Father, but if you're busy, maybe I could have the match postponed--

694
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:10,747
I told you, Norman, I'm not interested in the match. Find someone else!

695
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:12,916
Yes, sir.

696
00:54:21,057 --> 00:54:23,426
-RICHARD: A spade. -SANDY: Pass.

697
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,961
MAUDE: Two hearts.

698
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,866
He certainly clouded up.

699
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,504
Well, a word'll do it faster than a hickory stick anytime.

700
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:37,474
A spade, two hearts. Your call.

701
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,675
MEEKER: I pass.

702
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,753
Morning.

703
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:50,887
Hello.

704
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,890
I guess it's of no importance, but I wanted to tell you something about last night.

705
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:28,391
No need to.

706
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:31,628
You danced with me four times. It's more than I figured on.

707
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:34,497
No, I mean the way I walked off without saying anything.

708
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:38,101
It wasn't very adult of me, and I believe in being adult.

709
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:42,572
Forget it. You did your bit. Only I kind of figured you were having a good time.

710
00:55:42,872 --> 00:55:46,576
-To be frank, I was. -So you left me standing right in the middle of the floor?

711
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:48,945
That's just it! I didn't know what to do

712
00:55:48,978 --> 00:55:50,747
when the orchestra started playing that funny dance.

713
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,949
-What do they call it? -"The Navajo Rag"?

714
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:56,086
-That's the one. I'd never heard it-- -Never heard it before?

715
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,588
Where have you been? Locked up in some art gallery?

716
00:55:58,621 --> 00:56:00,056
Why, that's the hottest jig that kids do!

717
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,659
Yes, I noticed those girls with your friends.

718
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:06,396
They seemed to... well... shake automatically,

719
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:08,598
especially the pretty one with the dark hair.

720
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:10,600
Oh, the dark-haired one! She's a glue-foot.

721
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,435
Come here, I'll show you how to do it.

722
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,106
Now, look, all you have to do is this.

723
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:18,508
(clapping)

724
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,114
♪ There's a dance they do on the reservation ♪

725
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,716
♪ It's a dip and a glide and a hesitation ♪

737

(applause)

738
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,056
If we're going to be stared at, I think we should do this to real music.

739
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:10,627
Whenever there's another dance, will you ask me?

740
00:57:13,663 --> 00:57:14,764
Goodbye, gentlemen.

741
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:20,470
Bye, Giff.

742
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:22,539
Bye.

743
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,075
Yee-hoo!

744
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:52,101
-Three spades. -Double.

745
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:53,837
-Content. -Content.

746
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:57,874
(bugle plays)

747
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:10,019
Why do the British find it necessary to announce dinner as if it were a cavalry charge?

748
00:58:10,386 --> 00:58:13,289
-Shall we break? -Just when I'm getting some good cards?

749
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,658
Your grief has been noted. We'll break later.

750
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:17,727
Oh, that's what you said about luncheon.

751
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:22,198
By the time we dock, I'm gonna be one long loaf of liverwurst.

752
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:25,034
Sorry, partner. Not much there.

753
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,737
-Oh, Harry. -HARRY: Yes, sir?

754
00:58:28,371 --> 00:58:30,240
-Is the water still hot? -I just brought it, sir.

755
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:31,608
Thank you.

756
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,633
Is it necessary to lurk in dark corners?

757
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:59,569
I've come to ask you to have dinner with the children.

758
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:02,639
What I really mean is, to have dinner with Norman.

759
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,709
Don't worry. You won't have to put up with me. I'll eat in the cabin.

760
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:11,014
Oh, please, Richard. Don't take it out on him.

761
00:59:11,314 --> 00:59:14,284
He's too young to be slapped in the face without any explanation.

762
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:16,119
Then give him the explanation.

763
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,921
(Julia sighs)

764
00:59:19,122 --> 00:59:20,890
Richard, you can't mean that.

765
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:26,229
Richard, it doesn't concern him. It's an issue between you and me.

766
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:31,601
Norman adores you. You're the man he's loved since the moment he opened his eyes.

767
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:36,005
Can't you, for the few days we're still together,

768
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:40,777
at least show him the courtesy you would show a headwaiter?

769
00:59:41,377 --> 00:59:42,779
I'm sorry, Julia.

770
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:45,982
You're asking me to do something which involves character.

771
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,819
As you have pointed out, I am not a man of character.

772
00:59:51,220 --> 00:59:53,122
Oh, please, Richard. Please!

773
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:55,091
You're in my light, Julia.

774
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:58,294
MAUDE: We made it, partner. Three spades, doubled.

775
00:59:58,328 --> 01:00:00,063
Well, aren't we the lucky ones!

776
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:11,174
(tapping on wireless)

777
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,449
How long will it take to get to Boston?

778
01:00:19,482 --> 01:00:21,017
About seven or eight hours, sir.

779
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:23,186
There's a lot of traffic going out.

780
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:25,321
Seems like when we get to New York, everybody's...

781
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,193
planning to have a party.

782
01:00:31,494 --> 01:00:33,429
Yes, sir. About seven or eight hours.

783
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,300
Well, I guess that'll be soon enough.

784
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:39,902
That'll be 11 shillings, sir. Shall I bill it to your cabin?

785
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:43,439
-Yes, sir? -What time did this message come in?

786
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,709
I think Phillips handled that one, sir. He's having his dinner now.

787
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:48,244
Check your log. There's a mix-up.

788
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:50,813
This morning we got an iceberg warning from the Baltic.

789
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:53,349
Half an hour ago, this one from the Caronia was delivered.

790
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:55,685
Yes, that's right, sir. It came in at 7:40.

791
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:59,389
But it's dated April 12th, two days ago. Why the delay?

792
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,392
I don't know, sir. Something to do with transmission.

793
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,395
We got it half an hour ago and sent it straight to the bridge.

794
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:21,377
-Well, what did they say? -Held up at the other end, sir.

795
01:01:43,466 --> 01:01:46,836
-Hello, Chief. Thought you'd be having dinner. -Finished, sir.

796
01:01:47,303 --> 01:01:50,239
Where's your plot on that iceberg reported by the Baltic?

797
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:54,243
Right here, sir. Ahead and slightly north of our track.

798
01:01:54,277 --> 01:01:56,345
We should sight it about 8:00 in the morning.

799
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,917
There's another report from the Caronia. Plot it in, will you?

800
01:02:01,584 --> 01:02:05,188
42 north, 49.50 west.

801
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:06,956
That would put it up here, sir.

802
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,893
But the Caronia report was filed two days ago.

803
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:14,564
That'd be about right. There's a strong southerly drift.

804
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:16,966
A large enough berg could have moved down there...

805
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,868
almost where the Baltic sighted it.

806
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,337
Do you want to alter course, sir?

807
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:24,841
-What's the weather forecast? -Clear and calm.

808
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,546
Oh, I don't think so. No need to alter course yet.

809
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,915
I'll be on the bridge during the morning watch.

810
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:34,917
Shouldn't be too hard to spot it in daylight.

811
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:45,161
Mr. Murdoch, I thought I'd let you know,

812
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:47,396
the captain will be topside for the morning watch.

813
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,465
Night order book as is.

814
01:02:51,334 --> 01:02:54,237
-We gonna stay at 22 knots? -Why not?

815
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:59,509
-At 30, we couldn't reach that berg before daylight. -That's true, not this one.

816
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,281
But what if these are two different icebergs?

817
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:16,559

We must have come close.

879
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:08,637
Did we hit it?

880
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,807
No, sir. It hit us.

881
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,285

Damage that far aft? Check again.

885
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:34,463
All right. I'll tell him. We're taking water

01:10:34,496 --> 01:10:35,798

887

-Can they shore up? -LIGHTOLLER: No, sir. Ripped us like a tin opener.

Tell the chief engineer to start the forward pumps.

01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:50,846
Wilde.

891
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,482
MAN: Start the forward pumps!

892
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:59,488
Order all hands to stations.

893
01:10:59,521 --> 01:11:02,558
Passengers and crew don life jackets. Prepare to lower away all boats.

894
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,002
Captain Smith.

895
01:11:13,902 --> 01:11:15,504
(tapping on wireless)

896
01:11:15,537 --> 01:11:17,439
Break off traffic and get him up.

897
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:20,943
Stand by to send a C.Q.D. to all vessels. I'll send you the position immediately.

898
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:24,747
-C.Q.D.? That's for distress. -That's right. We struck an iceberg. We're going down.

899
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,586
Captain, I want to know exactly what's happened.

900
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,756
-There's been some, uh, underwater damage. -You can trust me, Captain.

901
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,326
-Is it critical? -MAN: Give me a hand with this cover!

902
01:11:37,726 --> 01:11:39,061
MAN #2: Over here, mate.

903
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:43,932
-Call up Boat Crew 6. -Well, to be on the safe side, we're clearing away the boats.

904
01:11:44,233 --> 01:11:47,903
Captain, I will not be put off. Is this ship going to sink?

905
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:53,375
She is. I'm ordering all women and children into the boats.

906
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:59,481
As for the rest of us, perhaps some vessel can get to us in time.

907
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:04,987
Captain Smith, in other words, there aren't enough lifeboats for the men.

908
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:20,069
(gunshot)

909
01:12:21,537 --> 01:12:25,574
(ship whistle blasts)

910
01:12:27,810 --> 01:12:30,846
(ship alarm blaring)

911
01:12:30,879 --> 01:12:34,049
MAN: All passengers go to their cabins and put on life jackets.

912
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,085
There is no cause for alarm.

913
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,887
You'll find life jackets on the rack in your wardrobe.

914
01:12:38,921 --> 01:12:40,756
Please proceed to your cabins immediately.

915
01:12:41,924 --> 01:12:44,059
You're to put on your life jackets.

916
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:47,896
After that, you're to proceed to the promenade deck by the after ladder.

917
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:53,602
(alarm blaring)

918
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:57,773
(whistle blasts)

919
01:12:58,140 --> 01:12:58,974
Did you hear what's happened?

920
01:12:59,742 --> 01:13:02,177
We ran into an iceberg. None of us even saw it. Isn't that the biggest cheat?

921
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:04,847
I knew there was something. It woke me. Norman, get dressed immediately.

922
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,751
Please relax. I've talked to the captain. There was a collision of sorts.

923
01:13:08,784 --> 01:13:12,087
The steamship company evidently felt we needed something to break the monotony.

924
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:15,524
-Is there any danger? -RICHARD: Danger? On a ship like this?

925
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:18,494
Nonsense. However, we have to follow instructions.

926
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:20,996
Now, put on warm things, everybody.

927
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:23,198
Comfortable, but as becoming as possible.

928
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,834
Annette, get the other jackets from in there.

929
01:13:26,135 --> 01:13:28,904
It might be a good idea to bring some blankets along.

930
01:13:28,937 --> 01:13:30,539
It may be chilly in the lifeboats.

931
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,609
Lifeboats? And you say there's no danger?

932
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:36,779
Julia, I'm afraid you don't understand the corporate mind.

933
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,148
Steamship companies serve the public.

934
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:42,217
To prove they're on the job, they like to inconvenience people.

935
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:44,787
Here, Julia, help Norman.

936
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,092
I imagine they'll row us out a few hundred yards while they repair the damage.

937
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:54,763
All right, Julia. We're assigned to number six lifeboat.

938
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:56,098
Remember, number six.

939
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,501
Well, I believe we're ready.

940
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:03,639
Norman, you better take these. Catch.

941
01:14:06,175 --> 01:14:07,476
Father?

942
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,714
Haven't you forgotten something too?

943
01:14:13,749 --> 01:14:14,917
Oh, I have.

944
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,523
Pay a thousand dollars to ride on the greatest ship that was ever built

945
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:23,525
and three days out somebody pokes a hole in it.

946
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,093
Why don't they patch it up and leave us alone?

947
01:14:25,427 --> 01:14:29,965
Hey, don't you walk out on me. I was gettin' some good cards. We're goin' on with that game.

948
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,634
Don't worry, Mrs. Young. When we get back, the cards will still be warm.

949
01:14:32,668 --> 01:14:34,503
-This way, madam. -All right. Do you mind?

950
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:43,979
MAN: Put on those jackets, please! Don't push! Please. Don't push! Please.

951
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,647
Here, put that jacket on.

952
01:14:46,915 --> 01:14:48,750
Annette! Annette!

953
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:52,621
MAN: Tie your jackets up, please! Tie yours up, sir.

954
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:55,824
Take it quietly, madam. Don't push. Please, don't push.

955
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,961
(ship whistle blasts)

956
01:14:58,994 --> 01:15:00,329
LIGHTOLLER: Number four boat, swing out!

957
01:15:00,596 --> 01:15:03,966
Number two crew, see your boat clear of the ship's side before you lower away.

958
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,170
Officer, there's nobody to man this boat.

959
01:15:08,203 --> 01:15:10,973
There's a crew on its way up. Keep your people together.

960
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:13,709
WILDE: Find your proper boat!

961
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:17,079
Them to starboard's odd. Them to port's even.

962
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:18,714
Is there any way I can help, sir?

963
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:19,748
Yes, you can move out of the way,

964
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:23,819
and see that this passage is kept clear. Stand back, everybody, and keep together!

965
01:15:23,852 --> 01:15:25,888
Are all your people with you? Your entire family?

966
01:15:25,921 --> 01:15:28,991
Yes, they're all here. On second thought, I have some stragglers.

967
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:32,094
-Number eight crew! -Wait over here. I'll be back shortly.

968
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,996
-You can't leave us now! -I'll be back.

969
01:15:34,730 --> 01:15:37,666
Mr. Sturges, can you use your influence? Do you know what's going on?

970
01:15:37,933 --> 01:15:39,434
Stand back. Keep the passage clear.

971
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:43,672
Mrs. Sturges, they say it's nothing, but they're lying. There's water below.

972
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,241
And now somebody says there aren't enough lifeboats for the men.

973
01:15:46,575 --> 01:15:50,012
(ship whistle blasts)

974
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:57,085
Richard, I see they got you into one of those. This doesn't fit.

975
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,354
-You're not busy. I may need you. -Can't be that bad.

976
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:03,158
I'm afraid it is. We may be having sand for supper tonight. Come on.

977
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:08,964
(alarm blaring continues)

978
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:15,170
-MAN: Put on your life jackets! -(crowd clamoring)

979
01:16:15,203 --> 01:16:16,939
MAN: Leave everything behind!

980
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:20,375
Walk by the after deck! Please, put on your life jackets.

981
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:25,013
Walk by the after deck. Please, you must take a life jacket. Come on.

982
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,049
Steward! Can't you get some order here?

983
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,418
They don't want to go, sir. We can't make them understand about the trouble.

984
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:31,019
Well, give me a try. Here.

985
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:35,824
-Mrs. Uzcadum. -(foreign language)

986
01:16:35,857 --> 01:16:37,459
-(foreign language) -Get to your feet!

987
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:41,697
-No, safer place here. -I am at the moment the head of this family. Now, get up!

988
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:45,901
(Sandy speaking foreign language)

989
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:53,809
-(anxious chattering) -(alarm blaring continues)

990
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:59,815
MAN: Remain on this deck. The boats will be lowered down.

991
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:03,785
-I don't think it's so serious. We'll get help. -I think so too.

992
01:17:03,819 --> 01:17:06,154
I'll bet there are practically seven or eight ships coming right now.

993
01:17:06,188 --> 01:17:10,158
But anyway, just in case we get on different boats...

994
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:15,097
if you get to New York first, would you mind calling up home for me?

995
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,399
Of course not. They'll all be worried.

996
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,801
There's just Jackie. That's my kid sister.

997
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:24,373
Tell her I didn't win any medal, but I bought her a pocketbook instead...

998
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:26,675
with beads on it.

999
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:29,878
MAN: Keep your falls clear!

1000
01:17:29,911 --> 01:17:32,314
It was supposed to get there for Easter, but I'll bet it didn't.

1001
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:36,018
You'll be there to tell her, Giff. You're just as apt to be there before me.

1002
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:37,219
Oh, sure.

1003
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:42,090
But even if not, there's one thing I want you to know.

1004
01:17:42,724 --> 01:17:47,763
I don't think you'll believe it, but I wouldn't have missed this boat trip.

1005
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:49,965
Not for anything.

1006
01:17:50,465 --> 01:17:54,202
(ship whistle blasts)

1007
01:17:56,471 --> 01:18:00,008
Officer, Officer, have you room here for four more?

1008
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:01,943
I think so, sir. Are they assigned to this boat?

1009
01:18:01,977 --> 01:18:04,246
They are now. Go ahead, Mrs. Uzcadum.

1010
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:07,015
RICHARD: Here's a nice lady. She'll take care of you.

1011
01:18:09,451 --> 01:18:11,253
Bon voyage, Madeleine, my dear.

1012
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,288
Bless you, Richard.

1013
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:23,432
LIGHTOLLER: Stand back, there.

1014
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:26,468
Hop in for you, lad.

1015
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:30,972
Take a turn on that line! Keep your falls clear!

1016
01:18:31,339 --> 01:18:33,308
Keep your falls clear!

1017
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:36,912
-Some loose ends to take care of, Julia. -Yes, I saw.

1018
01:18:37,512 --> 01:18:39,081
They're loading your lifeboat.

1019
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,317
I'd better go to my own. It's on the other side.

1020
01:18:43,118 --> 01:18:47,456
It will be a long walk, Richard, but thank you for lying.

1021
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:50,459
I know you're trying to make it easy for us.

1022
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,528
This way is easier for me too.

1023
01:18:55,330 --> 01:18:58,100
Oh, Richard, where did we miss out on each other?

1024
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,539
I... I beg your pardon, sir.

1025
01:19:05,474 --> 01:19:10,078
I put you down as a useless man, somebody to lead a cotillion.

1026
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:13,949
After all, it was my major talent.

1027
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:19,488
Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry about everything.

1028
01:19:19,521 --> 01:19:21,022
(cries)

1029
01:19:23,158 --> 01:19:25,827
We have no time to catalog our regrets.

1030
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:30,198
All we can do is pretend 20 years didn't happen.

1031
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,236
It's June again.

1032
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:39,441
You're walking under some elm trees in a white muslin dress.

1033
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,378
The loveliest creature I ever laid eyes on.

1034
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:47,315
That summer, when I asked you to marry me...

1035
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:50,519
I pledged my eternal devotion.

1036
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,390
I would consider it a great favor, Julia,

1037
01:19:56,391 --> 01:19:59,294
if you would accept a restatement of that pledge.

1038
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,363
-(ship whistle blasts) -Oh!

1039
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,334
-Please, madam. -(Julia sobs)

1040
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:09,304
Go ahead, my dear.

1041
01:20:10,338 --> 01:20:11,973
(Julia sobs)

1042
01:20:14,976 --> 01:20:18,480
MAN: Hurry up! Number six boat ready to lower away!

1043
01:20:18,513 --> 01:20:20,615
Stand by your falls!

1044
01:20:22,417 --> 01:20:23,852
Come along, Annette.

1045
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,289
Help your sister, Norman.

1046
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,392
NORMAN: Shouldn't I wait and go on the boat with you?

1047
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:33,662
-The officer put you here, didn't he? -Yes, sir.

1048
01:20:33,695 --> 01:20:37,432
-You know the rules. A good soldier obeys orders. -Yes, sir.

1049
01:20:37,465 --> 01:20:38,867
Au revoir, my pets.

1050
01:20:44,139 --> 01:20:46,174
You look fat and funny in those life jackets.

1051
01:20:46,208 --> 01:20:48,410
Like Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

1052
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:57,052
MAN: Numbers four and six lifeboats, stand by to lower away.

1053
01:20:57,085 --> 01:20:59,221
All passengers to the promenade deck.

1054
01:21:02,057 --> 01:21:04,893
(alarm blaring continues)

1055
01:21:07,229 --> 01:21:09,998
LIGHTOLLER: Stand back, everybody, and keep together!

1056
01:21:16,004 --> 01:21:18,473
(ship whistle blasts)

1057
01:21:23,144 --> 01:21:26,615
Attention! Attention, all able-bodied men!

1058
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:30,552
We need your help further aft as quickly as you can, please.

1059
01:21:31,086 --> 01:21:35,023
MAN: Over here at once! Over here! This side.

1060
01:21:35,056 --> 01:21:36,291
All right, men. This way.

1061
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:40,328
Keep moving.

1062
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:50,972
MAN: Remain on this deck. The boats will be lowered down.

1063
01:21:52,474 --> 01:21:54,643
All right! Give me one of them paddles!

1064
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:57,646
Over here, mates! Lend a hand! She's stuck!

1065
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,017
Some of you, on the end of this rope. The rest of you, over on the other one. Come on!

1066
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:15,330
MAN: All women and children to lifeboat number six.

1067
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,198
In your lifeboat, please.

1068
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:34,282
-I'm sorry, ma'am. She's loaded. -Where will I go, Officer?

1069
01:22:34,316 --> 01:22:37,118
Well, there may be another boat. Sorry. There's no room in this.

1070
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,688
MAN: Stand back.

1071
01:22:41,723 --> 01:22:43,325
Here's a space.

1072
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:54,102
MAN: All right. Lower away.

1073
01:22:57,772 --> 01:22:59,274
MAN: Keep your arms in.

1074
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,612
Where's Norman?

1075
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,616
Norman? Norman!

1076
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,720
He gave a woman up front his seat.

1077
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,223
(yelling) Norman! Norman!

1078
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:18,326
(ship whistle blasts)

1079
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:24,032
(sobbing)

1080
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,537
MAN: Jam problem! We're stuck in the block!

1081
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,074
She won't clear. Get a marlinespike.

1082
01:23:36,244 --> 01:23:37,645
We'll never do it this way.

1083
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,692
MAN: Number ten is farther aft, sir.

1084
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:54,329
Seaman on number four line, fall away!

1085
01:24:21,256 --> 01:24:23,224
(people screaming)

1086
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:45,680
(tapping on typewriter)

1087
01:24:47,515 --> 01:24:50,351
From the Carpathia, sir. "We are coming full speed,

1088
01:24:50,385 --> 01:24:53,855
41 degrees, 30 minutes north, 49 degrees, 21 minutes west."

1089
01:24:54,456 --> 01:24:56,191
CAPTAIN: Give me their position again.

1090
01:24:56,424 --> 01:24:59,694
MAN: 41 degrees, 30 north, 49 degrees, 21 west.

1091
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:10,638
Have Mr. Lightoller pass the word to the lifeboats.

1092
01:25:10,672 --> 01:25:13,208
Steer east southeast. They'll be picked up by dawn.

1093
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:22,650
(alarm blaring continues)

1094
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:35,697
-(ship whistle blasts) -MAN: All clear, Officer.

1095
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,756
-Can you still keep up steam? -We'll give her a try, sir.

1096
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,892
Good. We need power for the Marconi instrument,

1097
01:26:03,925 --> 01:26:06,327
and I want to keep the lights burning as long as possible.

1098
01:26:06,361 --> 01:26:09,230
-If there's a ship coming, she has to see us. -Right, sir.

1099
01:26:10,098 --> 01:26:13,301
I presume you know you may not make it out of here.

1100
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:15,670
Yes, sir. That's the way of it sometimes.

1101
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:16,738
Good luck.

1102
01:26:46,801 --> 01:26:49,003
I see you made it, Mr. Meeker.

1103
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,608
(ship whistle blasts)

1104
01:26:57,946 --> 01:27:00,648
(alarm blaring continues)

1105
01:27:13,661 --> 01:27:17,899
(ship whistle blasts)

1106
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:26,708
Oh, Norman. Oh, my little boy.

1107
01:27:30,345 --> 01:27:33,748
-Steward, you know Mr. Sturges. Have you seen him? -No, I haven't.

1108
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:53,001
MAN: Number seven coxswain, to starboard.

1109
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:57,905
LIGHTOLLER: Please sit down when you get in the boat. Please keep still.

1110
01:27:58,673 --> 01:28:01,009
Fasten your life jacket, please, ma'am.

1111
01:28:01,442 --> 01:28:04,545
(ship whistle blasts)

1112
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:12,654
MAN: Number three boiler room, flooded.

1113
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:17,458
We're flooded to the after-coal bunkers, sir.

1114
01:28:17,492 --> 01:28:19,460
The transverse bulkheads are about to go.

1115
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:21,529
We're finished when the water hits the main boilers.

1116
01:28:23,097 --> 01:28:24,799
Order all hands up from below.

1117
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,868
-Their duty's done. -Yes, sir.

1118
01:28:27,101 --> 01:28:29,370
Mr. McDermatt's waiting amidships, sir.

1119
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,540
-What? -Mr. McDermatt, sir.

1120
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,742
Oh... yes.

1121
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:43,584
-You sent for us, sir? -Yes, Mr. McDermatt, I think it might help if you'd play.

1122
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:46,120
Yes, sir. "Londonderry Air."

1123
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:50,425
(band starts playing)

1124
01:29:14,148 --> 01:29:16,751
Please sit down the moment you get in the boat.

1125
01:29:17,985 --> 01:29:19,954
Please sit down when you get in the boat.

1126
01:29:20,888 --> 01:29:24,892
Take your places, please, and keep still. Keep your hands on the inside.

1127
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:27,161
MAN: Mind your head.

1128
01:29:30,465 --> 01:29:31,632
All right, Mrs. Straus.

1129
01:29:31,666 --> 01:29:34,836
-No, please. -Mrs. Straus, this is the last lifeboat.

1130
01:29:34,869 --> 01:29:36,771
Please, sir, I'm a very old lady.

1131
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,906
I've been with Mr. Straus most of my life.

1132
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:40,708
I will not leave him now.

1133
01:29:44,145 --> 01:29:45,446
All right, ma'am.

1134
01:29:50,585 --> 01:29:52,086
Slack away your first lines.

1135
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:55,189
Keep your hands inside the boat.

1136
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:56,958
Easy, men.

1137
01:29:57,959 --> 01:30:00,495
(band continues)

1138
01:30:00,528 --> 01:30:03,765
Let go your first lines. Please sit still in the boat.

1139
01:30:03,798 --> 01:30:06,567
Fasten your life jacket, ma'am! Lower away!

1140
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:23,618
Look out! She's gonna blow!

1141
01:30:29,023 --> 01:30:31,726
(explosion)

1142
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:46,507
(coughing)

1143
01:30:51,913 --> 01:30:53,548
Don't go in there, sir!

1144
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:55,783
The starboard boiler's gone, and the port one's about to go!

1145
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:58,553
-Are there men in there? -A few, pinned under the rig.

1146
01:30:58,886 --> 01:31:00,988
For God's sake, mister, don't go in there!

1147
01:31:01,355 --> 01:31:03,758
For God's sake, I am going in.

1148
01:31:05,159 --> 01:31:07,728
(explosion)

1149
01:31:07,762 --> 01:31:09,764
(screaming)

1150
01:31:31,018 --> 01:31:33,254
RICHARD: Norman. Norman!

1151
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:38,192
What's happened? What are you doing here?

1152
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:41,829
-I was afraid I couldn't find you, sir. -Come with me.

1153
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:45,566
On the lower decks, it won't do any good to jump.

1154
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,703
The water's near freezing! Move aft!

1155
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,037
-Move-- -Officer,

1156
01:31:50,071 --> 01:31:52,240
this boy's still aboard. Where are they loading?

1157
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,675
Sorry, sir. All the lifeboats have gone.

1158
01:31:58,946 --> 01:32:00,014
Well, Norman...

1159
01:32:01,983 --> 01:32:03,317
I didn't count on this.

1160
01:32:03,751 --> 01:32:07,054
All of the other men were staying. I thought perhaps I should too.

1161
01:32:07,388 --> 01:32:09,290
I'm wearing long trousers, sir.

1162
01:32:11,692 --> 01:32:14,195
I guess long trousers are enough to prove you're a man.

1163
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:18,666
Just the same, you're sore at me for coming back, aren't you, sir?

1164
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:20,167
Yes, I'm sore at you...

1165
01:32:20,902 --> 01:32:23,304
the way I've always been sore at those fool drummer boys

1166
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:25,239
who stayed on to play "Last Retreat".

1167
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,144
I... I thought maybe we could make a swim of it, together.

1168
01:32:32,914 --> 01:32:36,183
Well, whatever happens...

1169
01:32:37,652 --> 01:32:39,120
I love you very much.

1170
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:43,291
I've been proud of you every day of your life.

1171

We're finished, mate.

1179
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:32,773
Mr. Jackson, you will make the last entry in the log and secure.

1180
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:42,416
"At this hour, all wireless communication broken off.
