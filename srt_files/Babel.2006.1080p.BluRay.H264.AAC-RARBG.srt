1
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,244
It's almost new.

2
00:01:48,443 --> 00:01:50,206
Three hundred cartridges.

3
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:56,040
The guy who
gave it to me said...

4
00:01:56,151 --> 00:02:01,555
you can hit
as far as three kilometers.

5
00:02:08,497 --> 00:02:10,465
How much are you asking
for all of this?

6
00:02:10,565 --> 00:02:12,226
One thousand dirhams.

7
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:14,262
One thousand dirhams?

8
00:02:18,407 --> 00:02:20,568
I'll give you five hundred.

9
00:02:25,314 --> 00:02:26,440
And a goat.

10
00:02:35,557 --> 00:02:40,893
With this rifle, your sons
will kill plenty of jackals.

11
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,563
Here, let one of your boys try.

12
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,101
Let Yussef shoot.

13
00:02:50,572 --> 00:02:52,335
Dad, I want to shoot first.

14
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:04,183
This is the safety.
Push it in when you're ready.

15
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:12,158
If he doesn't hit the jackals,
at least he'll scare the shit out of them.

16
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,591
Your turn Yussef.

17
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,869
He shoots better than you.

18
00:03:38,153 --> 00:03:39,450
Good luck,
have a good day.

19
00:03:39,554 --> 00:03:40,543
God bless you.

20
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:43,624
Kill at least three jackals.

21
00:03:44,493 --> 00:03:48,987
Make sure no one
sees you with the rifle...

22
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:52,965
if you see someone coming, hide it.

23
00:04:32,007 --> 00:04:33,440
What are you doing?

24
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,234
I told you,
don't spy on her.

25
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,903
What do you care?

26
00:04:39,014 --> 00:04:40,675
Move it.

27
00:05:02,037 --> 00:05:03,766
Five to two.

28
00:05:05,774 --> 00:05:07,002
There's a jackal.

29
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,075
Where?

30
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,002
Over there.

31
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:17,115
What are you doing,
you idiot?

32
00:05:35,904 --> 00:05:37,735
Zohra doesn't mind.

33
00:05:38,406 --> 00:05:41,068
She doesn't, but I do.

34
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:45,880
This is between her and me.

35
00:05:47,282 --> 00:05:52,242
You're both pigs.
Next time I'm going to tell Dad.

36
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,245
Stay out of this.

37
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:57,883
If you want me to stay out of it,
don't do it.

38
00:06:58,486 --> 00:06:59,919
What are you doing?

39
00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:05,025
Hassan said this bullet
could reach three kilometers.

40
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:07,393
That rock didn't move.

41
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:09,965
You don't know how to shoot.
Give me the rifle.

42
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,362
See.

43
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:22,204
Yeah, but that's not
three kilometers.

44
00:07:35,357 --> 00:07:37,848
I bet the bullet
can't hit that far.

45
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:43,693
These bullets are lame.

46
00:07:44,566 --> 00:07:46,227
You're not aiming right.

47
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:52,004
What'll you give me
if I hit that car?

48
00:07:53,174 --> 00:07:54,539
I'll shoot.

49
00:08:00,715 --> 00:08:02,683
You see? Nothing.

50
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,079
Let me shoot.

51
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,979
Shoot at it.

52
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:25,099
See... nothing.

53
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:28,975
You're right, they're useless.

54
00:08:50,965 --> 00:08:53,866
Where are these kids?

55
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:56,660
Where are you?

56
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:59,740
I'm coming to get you...

57
00:09:02,977 --> 00:09:04,968
You win.

58
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:13,775
Did you brush your teeth?

59
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:26,853
Sleep with angels, my darling.

60
00:10:29,164 --> 00:10:30,893
Sleep well, sweetie.

61
00:10:50,251 --> 00:10:52,014
You are already sharing a room...

62
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,317
didn't we agree
to sleep with the lights off?

63
00:10:56,858 --> 00:10:58,849
There's nothing to be scared of.

64
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:08,429
No, that won't happen to you.

65
00:12:37,225 --> 00:12:40,023
How can I be
in two places at once?

66
00:12:40,194 --> 00:12:43,027
I'm just asking you
to take them for today.

67
00:12:43,898 --> 00:12:46,628
I can't, the mister is still home.

68
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,291
And they aren't going out?

69
00:12:48,403 --> 00:12:50,371
No, I don't think so.

70
00:12:51,673 --> 00:12:55,040
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

71
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,911
I can't Amelia.

72
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,015
Please, it's my son's wedding.

73
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:06,914
Just for the day, Lucia.
I'll be back for them tonight.

74
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,251
And what do I say to Mrs. Catherine?

75
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:14,021
I don't know.
Tell her they're your nephews.

76
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:16,187
Right, because they look
so much like me...

77
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:18,265
with my American looking face!

78
00:13:41,522 --> 00:13:42,750
What's up?

79
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,883
Hi Auntie.

80
00:13:45,026 --> 00:13:46,960
Great to see you, Santiago.

81
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,031
They're really shy.

82
00:13:56,204 --> 00:13:58,001
What? These kids
are coming with us?

83
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:00,301
I couldn't find anyone to watch them.

84
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,236
Their parents won't return tonight.

85
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:04,243
Why bring them?
They'll drive you crazy.

86
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:06,540
Don't worry,
they're very good kids.

87
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,882
Don't you want to
leave them with somebody?

88
00:14:09,984 --> 00:14:11,349
I know a girl who
can take care of them.

89
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:14,250
Are you crazy?
I have to take them with me.

90
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:16,516
I can't leave them
with just anybody.

91
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,549
Are you sure, Auntie?

92
00:20:15,616 --> 00:20:17,277
The ball was out.

93
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,317
That was out.

94
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:25,124
No, it was good.

95
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,553
That was out.

96
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:31,688
I'm deaf, not blind.

97
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,125
You're out.

98
00:20:53,287 --> 00:20:58,350
You shouldn’t have lost your temper.
We lost the game.

99
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:01,193
It wasn't my fault,
it was the ref.

100
00:21:02,463 --> 00:21:06,900
If you hadn't been thrown out,
we would’ve won the game.

101
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,630
Why are you
in a bad mood?

102
00:21:12,973 --> 00:21:16,773
She's always in a bad mood
because nobody's fucked her yet.

103
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:20,780
I'm gonna fuck your dad
to get rid of my mood.

104
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,951
I'll see you at the J-Pop.

105
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,743
What do you want to eat?

106
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:55,678
I said I'd meet my friends
from the team at J-Pop.

107
00:21:56,717 --> 00:22:00,209
Didn't you tell me
we would have lunch together?

108
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:03,015
Dad, I told you I was
going to eat with them.

109
00:22:03,324 --> 00:22:05,986
You never pay attention to me.

110
00:22:15,569 --> 00:22:19,232
My mother always
paid attention to me.

111
00:22:24,445 --> 00:22:28,006
Why do you want to fight?

112
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:39,016
I miss your mother too.

113
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,567
I'm doing the best I can.

114
00:23:07,454 --> 00:23:10,321
Don't forget
the dentist at three.

115
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,827
Take care.

116
00:23:50,998 --> 00:23:52,465
Do you have a table?

117
00:24:05,646 --> 00:24:07,841
Why all the way in the corner?

118
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,981
Isn't the view nice?

119
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:30,102
Do you like him?

120
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:05,932
Hello.

121
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,205
Hello.

122
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:19,719
Can I play with you?

123
00:25:21,221 --> 00:25:23,212
Or you can
have a drink with us?

124
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,756
Tell him to speak slowly.

125
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:31,196
Can you say that
a little slower?

126
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:48,308
You assholes,
how embarrassing.

127
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:10,301
What's the matter?

128
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:15,170
They look at us
like we're monsters.

129
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,004
Oh, come off it.

130
00:26:32,025 --> 00:26:33,458
What are you doing?

131
00:26:33,627 --> 00:26:36,755
Now they're going to meet
the real hairy monster.

132
00:27:33,287 --> 00:27:36,222
<i>Don't forget your appointment</i>
<i>with the dentist. Papa.</i>

133
00:27:36,423 --> 00:27:37,754
I have to go.

134
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,917
I'll see you at your place, then.

135
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,929
What are you doing here?

136
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,632
Something we ate
gave us a stomach ache.

137
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,934
The goats will die
if they don't eat.

138
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:30,066
Wash your face
and take them out again.

139
00:28:30,177 --> 00:28:31,610
My stomach hurts.

140
00:28:31,879 --> 00:28:34,279
There are other
chores to do then.

141
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,815
Move it. Let's go.

142
00:29:07,881 --> 00:29:10,179
God bless. Bye, bye.

143
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:15,119
Thank you,
I'll see you tomorrow.

144
00:29:17,791 --> 00:29:19,884
Tell your mother
to prepare dinner.

145
00:29:38,712 --> 00:29:40,612
Did you kill any jackals?

146
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:44,076
We shot at them,
but didn't hit any.

147
00:29:44,551 --> 00:29:48,112
You have to kill them.
If not, they're going to eat all the goats.

148
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:49,984
Why did you come home late?

149
00:29:50,891 --> 00:29:54,156
They closed the road,
we took the long way.

150
00:29:56,463 --> 00:30:00,160
Apparently some terrorists
killed an American tourist.

151
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:02,032
An American?

152
00:30:02,269 --> 00:30:05,136
Yes, the terrorists attacked
a tour bus on the road.

153
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,570
No, there aren't any terrorists here.

154
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,972
You never know.

155
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,347
How do you know
the American died?

156
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:22,855
That's what they were saying.
The police are looking for the culprits.

157
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:27,447
Yes, this is Mexico.

158
00:31:30,991 --> 00:31:33,755
Yeah... it's full of Mexicans.

159
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,350
Don't talk like that.

160
00:31:35,796 --> 00:31:37,024
It's not true.

161
00:33:16,763 --> 00:33:21,166
How wonderful, you made it.

162
00:33:22,035 --> 00:33:23,900
You decided to bring them?

163
00:33:24,137 --> 00:33:25,365
Hey, what's up?

164
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:32,106
Oh, son, look how handsome.

165
00:33:32,579 --> 00:33:34,706
You look like Julio Preciado.

166
00:33:34,814 --> 00:33:38,773
Forget Julio Preciado,
he looks like Luis Miguel.

167
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,114
These are the kids
I take care of.

168
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:46,715
Say hi to Luis.

169
00:33:48,328 --> 00:33:50,159
Lucio, come here.

170
00:33:50,263 --> 00:33:52,527
This is Mike and Debbie.

171
00:33:55,268 --> 00:33:57,463
Take them to play.

172
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,742
Mom, I don't know how you did it,
but it zipped up perfectly.

173
00:34:09,849 --> 00:34:12,443
And it's been 15 years
since I wore this dress.

174
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:14,383
You haven't changed a bit, Ma.

175
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,820
Working dear, hard work...
that's what keeps you young.

176
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,325
What are you guys laughing about?

177
00:34:21,428 --> 00:34:23,123
Nothing Ma, nothing.

178
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,969
I'll give a buck to the first
who catches a chicken.

179
00:34:43,817 --> 00:34:45,944
Careful with the 'huevos.'

180
00:34:55,161 --> 00:34:56,856
Very good, Debbie got one.

181
00:35:00,033 --> 00:35:01,227
Debbie's the winner.

182
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:03,495
Okay, now we need another five.

183
00:35:03,603 --> 00:35:05,468
So we have five chickens here.

184
00:35:05,872 --> 00:35:07,931
Okay, now who's going to help me?

185
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:11,469
You? Okay, come.

186
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:13,573
Hold it tight, like this.

187
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,411
Grab it right.

188
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:24,252
Everyone back up...
give me some room.

189
00:40:44,043 --> 00:40:46,477
I need your phone.
I will pay.

190
00:42:52,138 --> 00:42:54,163
The bullet didn't
touch her spine.

191
00:42:54,907 --> 00:42:59,173
If she stays like this,
she will bleed to death.

192
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:14,788
Is there anything
we can do?

193
00:43:14,894 --> 00:43:17,328
I have to stitch up the wound
to stop the bleeding.

194
00:43:33,312 --> 00:43:35,837
And tell him
her clavicle is broken.

195
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:51,521
We have to
hold her down.

196
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:52,016
Here are the sterilized drill bits.

197
00:44:55,328 --> 00:44:57,523
You have cavities
in two molars.

198
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:23,988
What are you doing?

199
00:45:35,201 --> 00:45:36,759
What's wrong with you?

200
00:45:48,381 --> 00:45:49,370
Get out.

201
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,483
Get out right now.

202
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,695
Yes, I'll let him know.

203
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,393
That's Mr. Wataya's daughter.

204
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:45,267
Thank you.

205
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:52,638
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

206
00:46:53,279 --> 00:46:56,077
She's deaf-mute...

207
00:46:56,248 --> 00:47:01,083
Face her when you speak
so she can read your lips.

208
00:47:03,956 --> 00:47:06,254
Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?

209
00:47:08,995 --> 00:47:14,695
We are Yoshjo Hamano and Kenji
Mamiya of the Metropolitan Police.

210
00:47:17,236 --> 00:47:19,295
We would like
to see your father.

211
00:47:31,984 --> 00:47:38,651
No, it's nothing bad.
We just want to talk to him.

212
00:47:38,991 --> 00:47:41,118
Do you know
where he is?

213
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:47,297
Please tell him to call.

214
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:53,300
Don't be scared.
We just want to talk to him.

215
00:47:57,009 --> 00:47:58,033
Thank you.

216
00:48:08,521 --> 00:48:12,890
<i>Chieko, I waited for you.</i>
<i>I have a meeting so I'll be back late.</i>

217
00:48:13,025 --> 00:48:14,890
<i>I left you a bento box. Papa.</i>

218
00:48:20,232 --> 00:48:24,225
<i>I'm on my way to your place.</i>

219
00:48:25,004 --> 00:48:26,835
Where are you?

220
00:48:30,009 --> 00:48:31,533
Hurry up!

221
00:48:50,396 --> 00:48:53,661
<i>Moroccan officials</i>
<i>are investigating suspects...</i>

222
00:48:53,766 --> 00:48:56,428
<i>in the shooting of</i>
<i>an American tourist.</i>

223
00:48:56,535 --> 00:49:00,335
<i>Officials said the shooting</i>
<i>took place...</i>

224
00:49:09,682 --> 00:49:10,774
Are you ready?

225
00:49:10,883 --> 00:49:13,010
Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.

226
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:20,985
The cops came again?

227
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:25,095
Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months.
But these were different cops.

228
00:49:25,197 --> 00:49:27,563
Did they come to ask
about your mother's death?

229
00:49:27,666 --> 00:49:31,727
No, but they're probably going
to ask my dad about the same things.

230
00:49:31,837 --> 00:49:33,998
They're just not convinced,
are they?

231
00:49:40,779 --> 00:49:43,942
Believe it or not,
I liked one of the cops.

232
00:49:45,684 --> 00:49:46,673
Idiot.

233
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,253
Did you put on some panties?

234
00:50:52,518 --> 00:50:54,179
Are you sure
it was here?

235
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:57,019
An American stopped me.

236
00:50:57,156 --> 00:51:01,456
I was scared.
He was covered in blood.

237
00:51:03,062 --> 00:51:04,393
Where was the bus stopped?

238
00:51:04,496 --> 00:51:05,622
Over there.

239
00:51:06,432 --> 00:51:08,764
<i>Captain Alarid... Captain Alarid.</i>

240
00:51:10,069 --> 00:51:11,502
<i>I found cartridges.</i>

241
00:51:17,376 --> 00:51:20,243
We found four.
Here's one.

242
00:51:28,354 --> 00:51:29,719
Did you search all over?

243
00:51:29,822 --> 00:51:31,483
Yes, the whole mountain.

244
00:51:50,509 --> 00:51:52,204
They're from around here.

245
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:55,208
Find out who has
a .270 caliber rifle.

246
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:23,398
Hassan Ibrahim?

247
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:24,874
-Yes.
-Drop your weapon.

248
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:26,001
I don't have a weapon.

249
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:27,100
Drop it now.

250
00:52:27,212 --> 00:52:28,304
I told you to drop
your weapon.

251
00:52:28,414 --> 00:52:29,972
This is just my knife.

252
00:52:30,616 --> 00:52:31,640
Get on the ground.

253
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:32,739
What did we do?

254
00:52:32,851 --> 00:52:34,978
Get down on the ground...
face down.

255
00:52:36,822 --> 00:52:38,153
Don't look at me.

256
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:40,288
What did we do?

257
00:52:45,898 --> 00:52:49,095
Take these skins to Najib,
see if he wants to buy them.

258
00:53:06,485 --> 00:53:08,350
Why did you shoot at the bus?

259
00:53:11,957 --> 00:53:14,187
I didn't shoot at anyone.

260
00:53:15,461 --> 00:53:16,587
Then who?

261
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:25,564
It wasn't me.

262
00:53:29,908 --> 00:53:31,705
That was your rifle.

263
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:37,681
I sold it yesterday.

264
00:53:38,684 --> 00:53:40,276
Who did you sell it to?

265
00:54:09,782 --> 00:54:12,273
Do you know where
Abdullah Adboum lives?

266
00:54:13,585 --> 00:54:15,075
Yes.

267
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,584
You have to go over those mountains.

268
00:54:22,394 --> 00:54:23,952
Who lives
in this area?

269
00:54:24,062 --> 00:54:27,498
We live here with our mother.
Abdullah lives on the other side.

270
00:54:31,103 --> 00:54:36,302
If you're lying, I'm going to
come back and cut your balls off.

271
00:54:36,408 --> 00:54:38,672
You can come back
anytime you llke.

272
00:54:47,786 --> 00:54:49,777
Don't walk
between the graves.

273
00:55:12,511 --> 00:55:14,035
Papa... Papa...

274
00:55:14,146 --> 00:55:15,204
What happened?

275
00:55:15,314 --> 00:55:17,407
The pollce...
they're looking for you.

276
00:55:17,516 --> 00:55:18,710
Me? Why?

277
00:55:18,984 --> 00:55:21,384
No, not for you...
they're looking for us.

278
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:22,954
Looking for you?
Why?

279
00:55:23,622 --> 00:55:25,351
Because of the tourist.

280
00:55:25,858 --> 00:55:26,950
What tourist?

281
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:28,890
The American...
Yussef killed her.

282
00:55:28,994 --> 00:55:30,291
Liar, we both did.

283
00:55:30,395 --> 00:55:31,657
What are you saying?

284
00:55:31,763 --> 00:55:33,856
Yussef started shooting
at the cars...

285
00:55:33,966 --> 00:55:35,433
because Hassan said
that the bullet could go far.

286
00:55:35,534 --> 00:55:37,399
Liar, you started shooting at the cars.

287
00:55:37,503 --> 00:55:38,527
But you killed her.

288
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:40,002
What are you saying?

289
00:55:40,105 --> 00:55:42,938
Yussef killed the American
and he spies on Zohra naked...

290
00:55:43,041 --> 00:55:44,906
and Zohra lets him watch her.

291
00:55:45,177 --> 00:55:46,439
That's garbage.

292
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:49,943
It's not garbage.
She's a street girl and he spies on her.

293
00:55:57,589 --> 00:55:59,716
Time to drink!

294
00:56:27,052 --> 00:56:31,512
This song is dedicated
from Luis to Patricia...

295
00:56:31,623 --> 00:56:33,853
the most beautiful bride
in the world.

296
00:57:07,326 --> 00:57:12,263
I think Aunt Amella has to dance.

297
00:58:00,879 --> 00:58:03,439
Amella, can I have this dance?

298
00:58:04,349 --> 00:58:06,613
I don't think your wife
would llke that.

299
00:58:06,718 --> 00:58:11,451
Ohh, she passed away 10 years ago.
Come on Amella.

300
01:00:57,923 --> 01:01:01,518
Let's go dance... You have
something white on your face.

301
01:01:01,626 --> 01:01:03,856
Don't get excited,
it's only cake.

302
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:20,605
<i>Today, near Tazarine,</i>
<i>there was an incident.</i>

303
01:01:20,712 --> 01:01:22,475
<i>An American was shot.</i>

304
01:01:22,581 --> 01:01:27,450
<i>Authorities say it</i>
<i>could have been a robbery.</i>

305
01:01:27,552 --> 01:01:31,318
<i>But, the American government was</i>
<i>quick to suggest a terrorist llnk.</i>

306
01:01:31,423 --> 01:01:33,584
<i>Minister Hassan HazaI</i>
<i>has said...</i>

307
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:38,162
<i>that terrorist cells have been</i>
<i>eradicated in our country...</i>

308
01:01:38,263 --> 01:01:41,494
<i>and one act</i>
<i>of vulgar banditry...</i>

309
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:46,469
<i>followed by superficial evaluations</i>
<i>the U.S. places on it...</i>

310
01:01:46,571 --> 01:01:48,869
<i>cannot ruin our image</i>
<i>or the economy.</i>

311
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:57,161
You have to turn on the
air-conditioning, my husband is ill.

312
01:03:57,268 --> 01:04:00,328
No air-conditioning,
no gasollne near. I'm sorry.

313
01:04:00,438 --> 01:04:04,374
Please, it's too hot.
We can get dehydrated.

314
01:05:44,142 --> 01:05:45,473
Who are they?

315
01:05:46,311 --> 01:05:47,642
My cousins.

316
01:05:47,745 --> 01:05:49,144
Is he deaf-mute
llke us?

317
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:51,306
No, but he understands some.

318
01:05:57,455 --> 01:05:59,320
What is your name?

319
01:06:08,633 --> 01:06:10,066
Chieko.

320
01:06:10,969 --> 01:06:13,733
My name's Haruki.

321
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:32,914
It's whisky.

322
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:51,305
Do the cops come around here?

323
01:06:52,577 --> 01:06:54,044
Sometimes.

324
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:31,234
You smell good.

325
01:14:32,696 --> 01:14:35,290
Welcome home... may I help you?

326
01:14:45,642 --> 01:14:49,373
Are you sure
you want him to come now?

327
01:15:05,029 --> 01:15:07,725
Is this Detective Mamiya?

328
01:15:09,066 --> 01:15:13,332
The deaf-mute girl you met this
afternoon asked me to call.

329
01:15:13,437 --> 01:15:15,598
Yes, her.

330
01:15:15,706 --> 01:15:22,043
She says she needs to talk to you,
alone... about her father.

331
01:15:24,014 --> 01:15:25,481
Why did you do this?

332
01:15:26,750 --> 01:15:28,217
Why did you do this?

333
01:15:31,021 --> 01:15:32,454
Answer me, damn it!

334
01:15:34,024 --> 01:15:35,821
We were testing the rifle.

335
01:15:37,227 --> 01:15:38,990
Are you idlots?

336
01:15:39,396 --> 01:15:41,887
You killed a woman.

337
01:15:43,133 --> 01:15:44,498
And you....

338
01:15:45,302 --> 01:15:47,736
You got naked
so your brother could watch?

339
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,734
Zohra got naked lots of times
so Yussef could watch her.

340
01:15:52,910 --> 01:15:54,377
Is it true or not?

341
01:15:58,682 --> 01:16:00,172
Is it true or not?

342
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,691
Why did you do this to us?

343
01:16:19,703 --> 01:16:21,227
Where's the rifle?

344
01:16:23,207 --> 01:16:24,572
Where's the rifle?

345
01:16:25,142 --> 01:16:27,201
I told you,
a hunter gave it to me.

346
01:16:27,845 --> 01:16:28,971
What hunter?

347
01:16:31,148 --> 01:16:37,383
A Japanese hunter...
gave it to me.

348
01:16:37,821 --> 01:16:41,951
I've got a picture.
She can get it.

349
01:16:42,426 --> 01:16:43,518
Go get it.

350
01:17:07,918 --> 01:17:12,252
He's holding the rifle
he gave me.

351
01:17:38,182 --> 01:17:39,649
We're going to Najib's house.

352
01:17:39,750 --> 01:17:42,810
If the cops come,
tell them we went south.

353
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:03,896
This Abdullah doesn't llve
in the area you told us.

354
01:18:04,007 --> 01:18:05,668
Are you playing with us?

355
01:18:06,243 --> 01:18:08,473
He llves in the area
he told you.

356
01:18:08,579 --> 01:18:10,570
He llves there?

357
01:18:11,048 --> 01:18:13,516
You're going to take us.

358
01:18:52,656 --> 01:18:54,283
They're over there.

359
01:18:57,861 --> 01:19:00,193
The pollce, the pollce.

360
01:19:00,631 --> 01:19:01,962
Run... run.

361
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:29,850
Get down.

362
01:20:38,295 --> 01:20:39,592
Mom, stay here tonight.

363
01:20:39,696 --> 01:20:43,655
I can't, I have to get these kids home.
It's almost dawn.

364
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:45,994
But this fucking guy
is really drunk.

365
01:20:46,103 --> 01:20:50,335
Drunk my ass. I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

366
01:20:50,807 --> 01:20:53,002
Stay a llttle whlle,
the party's just starting.

367
01:20:53,110 --> 01:20:56,136
I would llke to, but these kids
have soccer practice tomorrow.

368
01:20:56,246 --> 01:20:57,338
See you soon, Son.

369
01:20:57,447 --> 01:20:59,506
Congratulations, my darllng.

370
01:21:01,651 --> 01:21:02,052
Take care of my grandchlld.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

371
01:21:02,052 --> 01:21:04,520
Take care of my grandchlld.
I'm dying to be a grandmother.

372
01:21:04,621 --> 01:21:06,020
Seriously, you're not drunk man?

373
01:21:06,123 --> 01:21:09,559
Drunk my ass.
I'm fine. I'll be back.

374
01:21:09,693 --> 01:21:13,652
Remember, they got you once already
and you got in a lot of trouble.

375
01:21:14,598 --> 01:21:15,860
Bye, Ma...

376
01:21:15,999 --> 01:21:19,526
If things don't work here,
I'll meet you with the 'gringos.'

377
01:21:51,802 --> 01:21:53,497
Hey, be careful.

378
01:21:59,409 --> 01:22:02,936
I'll cross the border
through Tecate...

379
01:22:03,046 --> 01:22:05,844
that will get us to
San Diego super fast.

380
01:23:41,878 --> 01:23:44,904
Don't say anything.
Let me do the talking.

381
01:23:45,215 --> 01:23:47,240
But you're provoking him.

382
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,113
I was just kidding.

383
01:25:13,169 --> 01:25:16,900
What now?
Motherfucker...

384
01:25:32,355 --> 01:25:33,879
What's that?

385
01:26:29,979 --> 01:26:32,607
I heard you... stop shouting.

386
01:26:34,651 --> 01:26:35,777
Don't shout at me.

387
01:26:38,788 --> 01:26:40,255
Stop shouting at me.

388
01:26:42,926 --> 01:26:44,791
Easy Santiago, please.

389
01:27:10,553 --> 01:27:11,986
What are you doing?

390
01:27:20,563 --> 01:27:23,259
What are you doing, Santiago?
What are you doing!

391
01:27:23,366 --> 01:27:26,631
See, I told you!
You shouldn't have brought them.

392
01:27:26,736 --> 01:27:30,331
Santiago, stop acting llke a
madman and stop the car.

393
01:27:31,374 --> 01:27:32,773
Please, Santiago, stop!

394
01:27:32,876 --> 01:27:35,606
Shut those kids up!
Shut them up!

395
01:28:03,706 --> 01:28:05,833
Please stop, Santiago.

396
01:28:11,247 --> 01:28:16,480
Motherfuckers, fucking gringo assholes,
here they come.

397
01:29:01,297 --> 01:29:02,321
Get out. Get out.

398
01:29:02,432 --> 01:29:03,660
Are you crazy? Where?

399
01:29:03,766 --> 01:29:07,031
Get out. If they catch us,
we're all screwed...

400
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:09,730
I'll lose them,
then come back for you.

401
01:29:09,839 --> 01:29:11,534
Get out, for Christ sake!

402
01:29:12,275 --> 01:29:13,640
Santiago, calm down.

403
01:29:13,743 --> 01:29:18,237
Aunt Amella, get out...
for the love of God!

404
01:29:41,571 --> 01:29:44,404
Santiago is going to
come back soon and...

405
01:29:44,507 --> 01:29:47,067
the sun is going to rise.

406
01:32:15,858 --> 01:32:17,655
Why can't you call
another ambulance?

407
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:20,160
They just told me
the ambulance isn't coming.

408
01:32:20,263 --> 01:32:22,788
And you know we don't
have another ambulance.

409
01:32:32,475 --> 01:32:34,773
He wants to know how
he will get his wife out of here.

410
01:32:34,877 --> 01:32:37,812
Tell him they said
his embassy will deal with it.

411
01:32:43,753 --> 01:32:46,483
The Americans
stopped the ambulance.

412
01:32:46,589 --> 01:32:49,456
They want to send a hellcopter,
but there are problems.

413
01:35:09,332 --> 01:35:10,424
Good evening.

414
01:35:10,533 --> 01:35:13,730
The doorman called to say
you wanted to talk to me.

415
01:35:13,936 --> 01:35:14,925
I don't understand.

416
01:35:15,037 --> 01:35:17,562
could you speak slowly?

417
01:35:19,575 --> 01:35:20,599
I'm sorry.

418
01:35:22,111 --> 01:35:25,547
What was it
you wanted to tell me?

419
01:35:40,363 --> 01:35:42,558
Do you have tea?

420
01:36:13,829 --> 01:36:17,458
<i>"My father had nothing to do</i>
<i>with my mother's death."</i>

421
01:36:20,903 --> 01:36:22,029
What's this?

422
01:36:42,224 --> 01:36:47,560
When your mother jumped off the
balcony, your father was asleep?

423
01:37:38,013 --> 01:37:39,310
You saw her jump?

424
01:37:48,691 --> 01:37:51,023
You've already told the other officers?

425
01:38:05,107 --> 01:38:06,972
What are you talking about?

426
01:38:52,221 --> 01:38:55,657
Does your father still hunt?

427
01:39:12,441 --> 01:39:16,901
There was an incident involving a rifle
in your father's name.

428
01:39:17,446 --> 01:39:20,813
That's why we want to talk to him.
Understand?

429
01:40:02,024 --> 01:40:08,725
Your father isn't going to jall.
We just need to talk to him.

430
01:40:17,473 --> 01:40:18,667
I have to go.

431
01:40:22,177 --> 01:40:23,644
I really have to go.

432
01:41:31,847 --> 01:41:33,508
What are you doing?

433
01:41:45,127 --> 01:41:46,822
What are you doing?

434
01:41:55,804 --> 01:41:56,930
Please stop.

435
01:41:58,807 --> 01:42:02,504
No, this is wrong.
You're just a girl.

436
01:42:09,051 --> 01:42:10,575
Enough, stop it!

437
01:42:59,068 --> 01:43:00,365
Give me that rifle.

438
01:43:00,469 --> 01:43:02,164
They're going to kill us.

439
01:43:06,108 --> 01:43:07,803
They're going to kill us.

440
01:44:14,376 --> 01:44:19,712
I killed the American. I was the
only one who shot at you.

441
01:44:25,120 --> 01:44:28,283
They did nothing... nothing.

442
01:44:33,028 --> 01:44:39,194
Kill me, but save my brother, he did
nothing... nothing.

443
01:44:48,677 --> 01:44:52,579
Save my brother...
he did nothing.

444
01:51:53,835 --> 01:51:56,804
They're alone.

445
01:51:58,607 --> 01:52:01,201
They are chlldren,
they will die.

446
01:57:30,772 --> 01:57:33,036
There's no need to apologize.

447
02:09:06,400 --> 02:09:11,633
Mr. Wataya, this officer
has been looking for you.

448
02:09:15,276 --> 02:09:19,679
Good evening, I'm Lieutenant Mamiya.

449
02:09:20,681 --> 02:09:22,876
Good evening, how can I help you?

450
02:09:25,519 --> 02:09:28,352
Sir, there was an incident and...

451
02:09:29,556 --> 02:09:31,524
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

452
02:09:31,625 --> 02:09:35,288
do you own a .270 callber
Winchester M70 rifle?

453
02:09:36,664 --> 02:09:38,461
Registration number...

454
02:09:41,001 --> 02:09:43,401
UK-9023.

455
02:09:44,204 --> 02:09:47,696
I don't remember the number,
but I did have a rifle llke that.

456
02:09:48,509 --> 02:09:51,376
Is it true that you gave that rifle
to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim...

457
02:09:51,478 --> 02:09:53,105
who llves in Morocco?

458
02:09:53,414 --> 02:09:54,676
Hassan Ibrahim?

459
02:09:56,350 --> 02:09:59,012
He says he was
your guide in a hunt.

460
02:09:59,286 --> 02:10:01,311
Hassan? Yes,
I remember him well.

461
02:10:01,422 --> 02:10:07,088
He was a good guide and a very
good man, I gave him the rifle in thanks.

462
02:10:09,296 --> 02:10:10,763
Did anything happen?

463
02:10:11,965 --> 02:10:15,162
That rifle was used
in an attempted murder...

464
02:10:15,269 --> 02:10:19,330
and the Moroccan pollce want
to confirm it's not off the black market.

465
02:10:19,440 --> 02:10:22,000
No, I gave it to him.

466
02:10:23,877 --> 02:10:26,368
Is Hassan ok?

467
02:10:27,848 --> 02:10:29,645
I don't know about that.

468
02:10:34,121 --> 02:10:36,282
Am I legally involved?

469
02:10:36,657 --> 02:10:41,754
Not for the moment, but can you
come down to the station tomorrow?

470
02:10:41,995 --> 02:10:43,622
I have a few questions.

471
02:10:45,833 --> 02:10:47,164
Can I leave now?

472
02:10:48,135 --> 02:10:49,625
Good night.

473
02:10:53,807 --> 02:10:54,933
Excuse me.

474
02:10:56,944 --> 02:11:01,847
I heard from your daughter...
about your wife on the balcony.

475
02:11:03,016 --> 02:11:04,381
I'm very sorry.

476
02:11:05,252 --> 02:11:06,617
What balcony?

477
02:11:08,522 --> 02:11:12,458
About how your wife killed herself
by jumping off the balcony.

478
02:11:20,401 --> 02:11:24,997
My wife never jumped off a balcony.
She shot herself in the head.

479
02:11:25,105 --> 02:11:27,369
My daughter was the first to find her.

480
02:11:29,343 --> 02:11:32,005
I've explained it
to the pollce many times.

481
02:11:33,847 --> 02:11:36,315
Don't bother us with that anymore.

482
02:11:37,451 --> 02:11:40,147
I'm very sorry sir, we won't
bother you anymore.

483
02:11:40,487 --> 02:11:41,681
Good night.

484
02:12:34,274 --> 02:12:35,866
