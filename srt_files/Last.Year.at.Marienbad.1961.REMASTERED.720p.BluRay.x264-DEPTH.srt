00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,895
<i>Silent rooms
where the sound of footsteps</i>

4
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,273
<i>is absorbed by carpets
so heavy, so thick,</i>

5
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:52,481
<i>that all sound escapes the ear.</i>

6
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:56,614

heavily laden</i>

12
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:18,128

sand and gravel</i>

<i>Between these walls
laden with woodwork,</i>

70
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,339
<i>with pictures
and framed engravings</i>

71
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,128
<i>through which I made my way,</i>

72
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,926
<i>amongst which I was already</i>

73
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,769
<i>waiting for you.</i>

74
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:06,730
<i>Very far from the setting
where I find myself now,</i>

75
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,943
<i>as you still wait
for someone who will not come.</i>

76
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:14,867
<i>Someone who may never come</i>

77
00:08:15,412 --> 00:08:17,699
<i>to separate us again,</i>

78
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,615
<i>to take you away from me.</i>

79
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,246
<i>We must wait a little.</i>

80
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,791
<i>A few minutes,
a few seconds no more.</i>

81
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:33,177
<i>A few seconds,
as if you were still in doubt</i>

82
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,929
<i>about parting
with him and yourself.</i>

83
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,513
<i>As if his fading figure
might even now reappear...</i>

84
00:08:39,686 --> 00:08:42,804
<i>Here where he appeared
to you too vividly,</i>

85
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,314
<i>too fearfully, too hopefully.</i>

86
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,816
<i>Frightened of losing this bond...</i>

87
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:52,313
<i>This hope no longer has a purpose.</i>

88
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:57,576
<i>The fear of losing
such a suffocating bond is over.</i>

89
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:01,785
<i>This story is already over.</i>

90
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,826
<i>In a few seconds,
it will freeze forever.</i>

91
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,915
<i>Into a marble past, like these
statues worked in stone.</i>

92
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:14,551
<i>Like this very hotel,
filled with emptiness,</i>

93
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,259
<i>these static silent characters</i>

94
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,382
<i>long since dead</i>

95
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:24,930
<i>standing guard in the corridors
as I made my way towards you.</i>

96
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,019
<i>Between two rows of frozen faces</i>

97
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:31,436
<i>watching,
forever indifferent faces.</i>

98
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,946
<i>As I came towards you,
in your doubt.</i>

99
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,983
<i>Still watching
the threshold of this garden.</i>

100
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,038
<i>Now,</i>

101
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,122
<i>I am yours.</i>

102
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,926
Don't worry about
what the others think.

103
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,138
You know that...

104
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:11,725
You pretended only to listen to me.

105
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:17,688
I'm listening.

106
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:21,276
You make my role unbearable.

107
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:25,739
You confine me in a whispering
silence worse than death.

108
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,778
Lower your voice.

109
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,791
These whispers worse than silence.

110
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:36,079
These days worse than death
that we live through.

111
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:41,422
Like coffins buried side by side
in a frozen garden.

112
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:46,923
A reassuringly tidy garden
with clipped hedges,

113
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:50,935
with geometrical paths
down which we walk together,

114
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:55,690
day after day,
and almost hand in hand.

115
00:13:03,825 --> 00:13:05,908
It's unbelievable.

116
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,159
I don't quite remember.

117
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:16,752
It must have been in '28 or '29.

118
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:21,920
In the summer of '29,
it froze for a week.

119
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,304
A handsome woman.

120
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,893
Too much imagination.

121
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:58,286
You confine me in a silence
worse than death.

122
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:03,299
Like these days that we live
through, side by side,

123
00:14:03,468 --> 00:14:08,384
and almost hand in hand.

124
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,718
Our mouths forever apart.

125
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:14,727
<i>Fingers that never entwine,
eyes that do not see you,</i>

126
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:18,856
<i>for they are forced
to look away towards these walls</i>

127
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:22,939
<i>laden with carvings, crystal mirrors,
and outmoded pictures.</i>

128
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:26,404
<i>Fake cornices.</i>

129
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:30,071
<i>False doors and deceiving views.</i>

130
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,157
<i>False exits.</i>

131
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:34,283
Extraordinary!

132
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,949
Not so extraordinary as all that!

133
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:42,042
He set the whole thing up
himself, you know.

134
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:50,755
You've been here long?

135
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:52,764
No. But I've been before.

136
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,266
You like this place?

137
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:58,429
Not much. We just come here.

138
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:01,314
My father was to get a post.

139
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:07,070
A shoe with a broken heel.

140
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,071
From which there is no escape?

141
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:14,328
<i>From which there is no escape.</i>

142
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,577
Don't you know the story?

143
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,288
Last year it was all we talked of.

144
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:25,126
Frank told her that her father
had sent him to look after her.

145
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,167
An odd way of doing so!

146
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,427
She realized that later,

147
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:34,510
when one night
he tried to get into her room,

148
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:38,928
pretending he wanted
to explain a picture to her.

149
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:42,644
Having a German passport
doesn't prove much.

150
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:46,857
But his presence
has no connection.

151
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,875
I suggest a different game.

152
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,411
A game I always win at.

153
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,832
If you can't lose,
it's not a game.

154
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,593
I can lose, but I always win.

155
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,344
Two play.

156
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:20,352
The cards are laid out like this...

157
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,312
Seven.

158
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,692
Five.

159
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,901
Three.

160
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,412
One.

161
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,285
Each player in turn
picks up cards,

162
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:49,253
as many as he likes,
but from one row at a time.

163
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:53,669
The one who picks up the last card
loses.

164
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,304
Will you begin?

165
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:29,543
You haven't changed.
I feel I left you only yesterday.

166
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,707
What have you been doing?

167
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:35,377
Nothing. I'm still the same.

168
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:36,924
Not married?

169
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:39,635
A pity. It's fun.

170
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,809
I like to be free.

171
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:41,851
Here?

172
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,351
Why not here?

173
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,807
It's an odd place.

174
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,643
To be free in, you mean?

175
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:48,648
That, amongst other things.

176
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,855
You're still the same.

177
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,396
<i>You're still the same.</i>

178
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,927
<i>But you hardly seem to remember.</i>

179
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:29,682
<i>Yet you're familiar
with the setting,</i>

180
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:32,602
<i>this hand holding
a bunch of grapes.</i>

181
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,271
<i>Behind the hand,
you see the almost living foliage.</i>

182
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,657
<i>In a garden that would be ours.</i>

183
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,361
You've never noticed?

184
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,531
I've never had so good a guide.

185
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:49,702
"As the compass said to the ship",
goes the proverb.

186
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:56,167
I can show you a lot more here,
if you wish.

187
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,461
With pleasure.

188
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:02,013
Has this hotel so many secrets?

189
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,640
So many.

190
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,219
How strange.

191
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,445
Why look at me like that?

192
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,741
You hardly seem to remember me.

193
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,166
I first saw you in the gardens
in Frederiksbad.

194
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:18,002
You were alone,
apart from the others.

195
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,337
Standing by a balustrade,

196
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:24,846
resting your hand on it,
your arm half outstretched.

197
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,763
You were half facing
the main avenue.

198
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,098
You did not see me coming.

199
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:36,313
My footsteps on the gravel
finally drew your attention.

200
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,978
Then you turned your head.

201
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,984
It was not me.

202
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,320
You must be mistaken.

203
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,989
Remember.

204
00:20:49,165 --> 00:20:52,203
We were near a stone statue

205
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:55,456
on a tall pedestal.

206
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,504
A man and woman in classical dress.

207
00:20:58,883 --> 00:21:03,674
Their pose seemed to represent
something definite.

208
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,885
You asked me who they were.

209
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:10,801
I said I didn't know.

210
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,433
You tried to guess. I said

211
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,940
they might as well be you and I.

212
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,235
Then you began to laugh.

213
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,900
I love,

214
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:29,160
I already loved to hear you laugh.

215
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,167
The others had come near us.

216
00:21:36,337 --> 00:21:39,330
Someone named the statue.

217
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:45,299
He said they were Greek gods
or heroes from mythology.

218
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:50,307
Either that,
or some allegory or another.

219
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:55,726
You weren't listening.
You seemed far away.

220
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,062
Your eyes had become solemn
and empty again.

221
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:06,239
You half turned away to look
at the main avenue again.

222
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:33,092
<i>And once again
we found ourselves separated.</i>

223
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:04,881
It's impossible.

224
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,919
What if you played first?

225
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,844
<i>And once again
I made my way alone</i>

226
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,891
<i>along these same corridors,</i>

227
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,478
<i>through these same deserted rooms,</i>

228
00:24:03,651 --> 00:24:08,737
<i>past these pillars
and windowless galleries,</i>

229
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,273
<i>through these same doorways,</i>

230
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:17,242
<i>making my way at random
in the labyrinth around me.</i>

231
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,255
<i>And once again,</i>

232
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:37,974
<i>everything was empty and deserted
in this huge hotel.</i>

233
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,145
<i>Empty rooms, corridors,</i>

234
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,601
<i>rooms and doors,</i>

235
00:24:44,775 --> 00:24:46,767
<i>doors and rooms,</i>

236
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,028
<i>empty chairs, deep armchairs,</i>

237
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:52,898
<i>stairways, steps,</i>

238
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,317
<i>more and more.</i>

239
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,453
<i>Glass empty glasses.</i>

240
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:02,036
<i>A falling glass,
a glass partition.</i>

241
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,327
<i>A lost letter.</i>

242
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:08,421
<i>Keys hanging on their rings.</i>

243
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:11,549
<i>Numbered room keys:
three hundred and nine,</i>

244
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,588
<i>three hundred and seven,
three hundred and five.</i>

245
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:20,725
<i>Chandeliers and mirrors.</i>

246
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:23,971
<i>Empty corridors
as far as the eye can see.</i>

247
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,564
<i>Like everything else,
the garden was deserted.</i>

248
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:43,702
<i>It was last year.
Have I changed so much?</i>

249
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,584
<i>Or are you pretending
not to know me?</i>

250
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:50,122
<i>One year. Maybe more.</i>

251
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:53,250
<i>At least you haven't changed.</i>

252
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,919
<i>You've still the same faraway eyes.</i>

253
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:59,430
<i>The same smile,
the same sudden laugh.</i>

254
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,638
<i>The same way
of putting out your arm</i>

255
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,269
<i>to ward off something in the way,</i>

256
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,773
<i>of raising your hand
to your shoulder.</i>

257
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,604
<i>You're wearing the same perfume.</i>

258
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,901
<i>Remember.</i>

259
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:18,988
<i>It was in the gardens
in Frederiksbad.</i>

260
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:23,830
<i>You were standing alone.</i>

261
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:27,834
<i>You were leaning
on a stone balustrade,</i>

262
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:32,748
<i>resting your hand on it,
your arm half outstretched.</i>

263
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,505
<i>Looking towards the main avenue.</i>

264
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:43,471
<i>I came towards you,</i>

265
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:48,931
<i>but I stopped some way off,
and looked at you.</i>

266
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:52,851
<i>You were now facing me.</i>

267
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,823
<i>Yet you didn't seem to see me.</i>

268
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:03,236
<i>I was watching you.
You did not move.</i>

269
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,947
<i>I told you how real you seemed.</i>

270
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,289
<i>You just smiled.</i>

271
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:12,454
<i>I spoke of the statue.</i>

272
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:16,966
<i>I told you that the man
wanted to stop the woman.</i>

273
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:20,880
<i>He must have seen some danger</i>

274
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,844
<i>and was motioning his friend
to stop.</i>

275
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:28,804
<i>You replied that she was the one
who had seen something.</i>

276
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:34,443
<i>And that she was pointing out
something breathtaking.</i>

277
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,729
<i>Both explanations were possible.</i>

278
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:43,026
<i>The couple had left home
and had been walking for days.</i>

279
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:47,326
<i>They've just come
to the edge of a cliff.</i>

280
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:51,334
<i>He holds her back,
to keep her from the edge.</i>

281
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,713
<i>While she points to the sea
stretching to the horizon.</i>

282
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:59,834
<i>Then you asked me their names.</i>

283
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:03,263
<i>I replied that it didn't matter.</i>

284
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:07,930
<i>You didn't agree
and started naming them</i>

285
00:28:08,187 --> 00:28:10,395
<i>without much thought.</i>

286
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:12,058
<i>So I said</i>

287
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:15,020
<i>they might as well be you and I.</i>

288
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,729
<i>Or just anyone...</i>

289
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:30,411
Don't name them.
They may have had other adventures.

290
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,453
You're forgetting the dog.
What's he doing?

291
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,715
He's not theirs.
He just happened to run by.

292
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:41,676
But he's with his mistress.

293
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,177
She's not his mistress.

294
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:47,057
He's close,
because the pedestal is narrow.

295
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,018
The same couple have no dog
in that other statue.

296
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:55,102
They're facing now.
Her hand's caressing his lips.

297
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,484
Close to,
you can see she looks away.

298
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:01,484
I don't want to. It's too far.

299
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,445
Follow me. Please.

300
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:06,693
Please!

301
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,117
It's impossible.
I've never been to Frederiksbad.

302
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:16,331
Perhaps it was elsewhere.

303
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,548
In Karlstadt, or Marienbad,

304
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,008
or in Baden-Salsa,

305
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,636
or even in this room.

306
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:29,057
You followed me here
so I could show you

307
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,431
this picture.

308
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,139
The man's movements are clear

309
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,184
and so is the woman's arm.

310
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,522
But you must be on the other side
to see that the man

311
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,567
wants to stop the woman.

312
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,282
He's seen some danger, probably.

313
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,163
He motions her to stop.

314
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:07,129
I think I can give you
some more accurate information.

315
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,803
The statue is of Charles Ill
and his wife.

316
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:16,596
It's not of the period, of course.

317
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:21,526
It shows the Oath before the Diet.

318
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:27,445
The classical costumes
are completely conventional.

319
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,878
You were waiting for me.

320
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:31,300
No. Why should I be?

321
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:37,639
I've waited a long time for you.

322
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:39,974
In your dreams?

323
00:31:44,277 --> 00:31:47,315
You're running away again.

324
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,192
What do you mean?

325
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,275
I don't understand a word.

326
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:57,493
If it were a dream,
why should you be afraid?

327
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,750
Tell me

328
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,080
how our story continues.

329
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:05,956
We met again that very afternoon.

330
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:08,500
By chance, I suppose?

331
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,677
I don't know.

332
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:14,968
Where was it this time?

333
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:25,642
<i>Where? That does not matter.</i>

334
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:30,651
<i>You were with a group of people.</i>

335
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:35,444
<i>People I hardly knew.
I don't think you did either.</i>

336
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:41,207
<i>They were talking about
some current event or other.</i>

337
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:51,793
<i>You probably knew more about it
than I did.</i>

338
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,674
<i>I was watching you.</i>

339
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:03,270
<i>Your sparkling conversation
seemed forced.</i>

340
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:07,358
<i>I felt these people
didn't know who you were.</i>

341
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:10,069
<i>I alone did.</i>

342
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,905
<i>You didn't know yourself.</i>

343
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,238
<i>You kept avoiding my glance.</i>

344
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:21,281
<i>You were clearly
doing it on purpose.</i>

345
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:35,545
<i>I waited, I had the time.</i>

346
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,094
<i>I've always thought I've had time.</i>

347
00:33:43,939 --> 00:33:49,059
<i>When your eyes looked my way,
it was as if I didn't exist.</i>

348
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:53,567
<i>Finally, to make you look,
I spoke,</i>

349
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,198
<i>breaking into the conversation</i>

350
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,076
<i>with some remark</i>

351
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:02,535
<i>designed to draw your attention.</i>

352
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,289
<i>I've forgotten what it was.</i>

353
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:11,540
<i>You answered me
in the sudden silence</i>

354
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:15,300
<i>with irony on what I'd just said.</i>

355
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,179
<i>The others remained silent.</i>

356
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:23,309
<i>And again I felt no one understood.</i>

357
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,438
<i>Perhaps I was the only one to hear.</i>

358
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:57,840
<i>Then someone spoke
of the evening's entertainment.</i>

359
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,589
<i>Perhaps it was for the next day.</i>

360
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,551
<i>I forgot what we said next.</i>

361
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,600
<i>You didn't like walking</i>

362
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:50,605
<i>because of your high heels.</i>

363
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,397
<i>One day, later on I think,</i>

364
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,271
<i>you broke one of your high heels.</i>

365
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:01,486
<i>You had to take my arm</i>

366
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,368
<i>whilst you took off your shoe.</i>

367
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:09,749
<i>The heel was severed,
except for a strand of leather.</i>

368
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:13,453
<i>You looked at it for a moment.</i>

369
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,797
<i>Your foot scarcely touched
the ground,</i>

370
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:21,176
<i>posed before your other foot
like a dancer's.</i>

371
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,884
<i>I offered to fetch another pair.</i>

372
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,720
<i>You refused.</i>

373
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:31,012
<i>Then I said I could carry you back.</i>

374
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:35,896
<i>You just laughed, without replying,
as though...</i>

375
00:36:37,487 --> 00:36:40,321
<i>But that day,
you carried your shoes back.</i>

376
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:42,982
<i>You walked to the hotel
over the gravel.</i>

377
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,505
<i>I saw you again.</i>

378
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,007
<i>You never seemed to be waiting.</i>

379
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:08,178
<i>But we met at every turn,</i>

380
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,935
<i>behind every shrub,</i>

381
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,273
<i>at the foot of every statue,</i>

382
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,235
<i>by every fountain.</i>

383
00:37:22,157 --> 00:37:25,321
<i>As though, in all this garden,</i>

384
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,485
<i>there were only you and I.</i>

385
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,408
<i>We talked about anything,</i>

386
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,287
<i>the statues' names,</i>

387
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,005
<i>the shapes of the bushes,</i>

388
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:44,085
<i>the water in the fountains.</i>

389
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:49,883
<i>Sometimes we remained silent.</i>

390
00:37:55,273 --> 00:38:00,359
<i>At night especially,
you did not like to talk.</i>

391
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,483
<i>One night I went up to your room.</i>

392
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,476
<i>These walls were always there,</i>

393
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:04,729
<i>surrounding me.</i>

394
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,110
<i>Even, smooth, glazed walls.</i>

395
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:12,400
<i>These walls were always there.</i>

396
00:40:13,036 --> 00:40:15,119
<i>The silence, too.</i>

397
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:19,165
<i>I never heard a voice raised
in this hotel.</i>

398
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,500
<i>Conversations took place
in a vacuum,</i>

399
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,915
<i>as if the words meant nothing.</i>

400
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,051
<i>As though they could have
no meaning.</i>

401
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:34,220
<i>A sentence would stop in space,</i>

402
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,347
<i>frozen in its flight,</i>

403
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:42,225
<i>and resume its journey,
there or elsewhere.</i>

404
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,813
<i>It did not matter.</i>

405
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,149
<i>The same conversations,</i>

406
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:53,024
<i>the same missing voices.</i>

407
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:59,573
<i>The servants were silent.
The games.</i>

408
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,242
<i>It was a place of rest.</i>

409
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:08,001
<i>No business was done.
No conspiracies were bred.</i>

410
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:13,169
<i>No words were spoken
to arouse emotion.</i>

411
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,887
<i>There were signs everywhere:</i>

412
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:22,766
<i>"Silence... silence."</i>

413
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,302
Yes, I think I remember.

414
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:02,559
You saw it?

415
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:05,062
No, but a friend told me.

416
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:09,396
But you can check
the weather reports.

417
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:11,606
Let's go to the library.

418
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,912
Do you know what I heard?

419
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:33,420
This time last year,

420
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:38,170
it was so cold, the fountains froze.

421
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:42,967
It must be a mistake.

422
00:42:49,776 --> 00:42:53,816
What do you want?
You know it's impossible.

423
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:59,571
One night, I went up to your room.

424
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,032
<i>You were alone.</i>

425
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,544
Leave me alone.

426
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,339
It was almost summer.

427
00:43:16,511 --> 00:43:18,969
Yes, you're right.

428
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:23,182
There couldn't have been any ice.

429
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:29,973
It's time for the concert.
May I go with you?

430
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,178
Are you going to the concert?

431
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,898
I'll see you at dinner.

432
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:26,112
<i>This story is already over.</i>

433
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:29,782
<i>In a few moments, it will freeze</i>

434
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:32,535
<i>into a marble past.</i>

435
00:44:32,712 --> 00:44:35,625
<i>Like these statues
in this garden in stone.</i>

436
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:39,291
<i>Like this hotel
with its now empty rooms.</i>

437
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,492
You never seemed
to be waiting for me.

438
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:57,163
But we met at every turn.

439
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:59,916
Behind every shrub.

440
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,456
At the foot of every statue.

441
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,837
By every fountain's edge.

442
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,667
As though in all this garden

443
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:11,424
there were only you and I.

444
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:17,851
<i>We talked about
the statues' names,</i>

445
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:22,060
<i>the bushes,
the water in the fountains</i>

446
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,733
<i>and the colour of the sky.</i>

447
00:48:25,361 --> 00:48:27,523
<i>Sometimes we remained silent.</i>

448
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,776
But you always kept
some way away,

449
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,945
as if on the brink

450
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:15,659
of some dark forbidding place.

451
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,032
Come here.

452
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:33,968
Come nearer.

453
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,315
Leave me alone, please.

454
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:01,204
And again these walls,
corridors, doors.

455
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,117
And still more beyond.

456
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:08,871
In order to reach you,

457
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,587
you don't know the paths I've taken.

458
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,634
Now you are here.

459
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:21,550
You still try to escape.
But you are here in this garden,

460
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,470
within my reach,

461
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:27,890
within my sight. You are here.

462
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,065
Who are you?

463
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,195
What's your name?

464
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:40,986
That doesn't matter.

465
00:50:41,914 --> 00:50:44,372
That doesn't matter.

466
00:50:46,502 --> 00:50:48,710
You're like some phantom

467
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,296
waiting for me to come.

468
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,047
Leave me.

469
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:09,556
It's already too late.

470
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,773
You asked me not to see you.

471
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,230
But of course we met,

472
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:22,324
the day after or the next,
or the day after that.

473
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,781
Perhaps it was by accident.

474
00:51:26,417 --> 00:51:29,535
I insisted on your leaving with me.

475
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,755
You said it was impossible,
of course.

476
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:38,627
But now, you know
it's the only thing left

477
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:41,011
for you to do.

478
00:51:41,432 --> 00:51:43,845
Yes, perhaps.

479
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:48,345
I don't know.

480
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:53,479
But why must it be me?

481
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:55,393
You were waiting for me.

482
00:51:57,197 --> 00:52:00,611
No, I wasn't.
I was waiting for no one.

483
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:05,154
Waiting for nothing,
as though you were dead.

484
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:10,497
It's not true. You're still alive.

485
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:14,876
You're here. I can see you.

486
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:18,549
Do you remember?

487
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:24,598
It's probably not true.

488
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,642
You've already forgotten.

489
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,271
It's not true.

490
00:52:32,441 --> 00:52:35,934
You're leaving. Your door is open.

491
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,320
What do you hope to get from me?

492
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,324
What other life
would you have me live?

493
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,076
I don't mean another life!

494
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:49,114
It's a question of your life.

495
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,996
Remember.

496
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:57,664
One evening, the last, I think,

497
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,584
it was almost dark.

498
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:05,304
A shadowy figure
slowly advanced through the dusk.

499
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:10,309
Long before I could distinguish
your features,

500
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,558
I knew it was you.

501
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:17,525
When you recognized me,
you stopped.

502
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:21,605
We stood there, a few yards apart,

503
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,190
without saying a word.

504
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,703
You were standing before me.

505
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:31,490
Waiting, perhaps.

506
00:53:32,501 --> 00:53:36,211
Unable to move
either forward or back.

507
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,128
You stood there,

508
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:45,341
motionless.

509
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:48,969
Your arms at your sides.

510
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:53,474
Looking at me.

511
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,149
Your eyes open even wider.

512
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:01,895
Your lips parted,
as though to speak,

513
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:05,031
or groan, or cry out.

514
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,358
You are afraid.

515
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:10,403
You open your mouth a little more.

516
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:12,868
Your eyes get wider.

517
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:18,124
You hold your hand forward,
uncertainly, as if waiting,

518
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:23,333
appealing, or perhaps in defence.

519
00:54:23,969 --> 00:54:25,756
Your fingers tremble.

520
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:28,509
You are afraid.

521
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:46,693
Who is it?

522
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:49,654
Your husband?

523
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:57,826
He was looking for you,
or maybe passing by.

524
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,754
He was already nearing you.

525
00:55:03,634 --> 00:55:08,550
But you remained rigid,
as if you were not there.

526
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,758
He didn't quite seem
to recognize you.

527
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,640
So he stepped forward.

528
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:19,643
Something about you escaped him.

529
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:22,225
One step further.

530
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:26,025
You looked through him.

531
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,241
He chose to go.

532
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:36,869
And now, you still stare
into the empty space.

533
00:55:37,918 --> 00:55:40,160
You still see him.

534
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:43,375
His grey eyes.

535
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,584
His grey shape.

536
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:51,425
And his smile.

537
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,019
And you're afraid.

538
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:08,150
<i>You dread his return.</i>

539
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:11,316
<i>Again I come to your room.</i>

540
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:15,407
<i>His room was next door,
with a lounge between.</i>

541
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,994
<i>Besides, he'll be
in the card room now.</i>

542
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:21,250
<i>I had told you I would come.</i>

543
00:56:23,881 --> 00:56:26,339
<i>I found all the doors ajar.</i>

544
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:31,048
<i>The hall door,
the lounge door and yours.</i>

545
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,763
<i>I just had to push them open</i>

546
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:37,391
<i>and close them behind me.</i>

547
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,762
<i>You know the rest.</i>

548
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:48,149
No, I don't. I don't know you!

549
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:52,153
Nor this mantelpiece
with its mirror.

550
00:56:52,326 --> 00:56:55,865
What mirror? What mantelpiece?

551
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:59,368
I don't know any more.

552
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,449
It's not true.

553
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:04,836
Why should you be here otherwise?

554
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,294
What was the mirror like?

555
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,840
There's no mirror
over the mantelpiece.

556
00:57:13,597 --> 00:57:15,304
There's a picture.

557
00:57:16,016 --> 00:57:19,555
A landscape,
a snow scene, I think.

558
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,058
The mirror's over the chest.

559
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:27,313
There's also a dressing table

560
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:31,229
and other furniture as well.

561
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,775
What kind of bed?

562
00:57:36,703 --> 00:57:38,990
A big one, probably.

563
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:42,119
What could you see
from the windows?

564
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,783
I don't know.

565
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:50,130
I've never been
in any bedroom with you.

566
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,166
You don't want to remember.

567
00:57:52,511 --> 00:57:54,298
Because you're afraid.

568
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:58,674
Don't you recognize
this photo either?

569
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:04,183
No, I don't remember.

570
00:58:04,356 --> 00:58:06,097
You know who took it!

571
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:10,360
You didn't want me to.

572
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:13,146
You said it would upset you.

573
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:16,533
That's true. I was right!

574
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:22,280
I remember this room perfectly.

575
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,456
You were waiting for me.

576
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:29,420
Yes, there was a mirror
over the chest.

577
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:32,920
I first saw you in the mirror

578
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:36,382
when I pushed open the door.

579
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:41,891
You were sitting
in a sort of négligée.

580
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:47,146
You were all in white
and wearing this ring.

581
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:50,228
I'm sure you're making it up.

582
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:53,361
I've never had
a white dressing gown.

583
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,613
It was someone else.

584
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,199
As you wish.

585
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:03,538
You lay among white feathers.

586
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:08,701
Please be quiet. You're mad.

587
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:12,630
"No, no please!"

588
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,759
It's last year's voice I hear.

589
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:22,007
You were already afraid.

590
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:27,721
That night I loved your fear.

591
00:59:29,858 --> 00:59:34,398
I watched you
as you protested a little.

592
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,779
I loved you.

593
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,696
There was something in your eyes.

594
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:44,533
You were alive.

595
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:49,326
At first...

596
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,499
do you remember?

597
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,131
No.

598
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:59,885
You were sincere.

599
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,302
But only you know.

600
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,117
What's wrong?

601
01:01:05,537 --> 01:01:06,653
Nothing.

602
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,791
- Are you tired?
- A little.

603
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:15,912
It's the sun, all of a sudden.

604
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:20,633
Let's go back in, if you like?

605
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,632
If you like.

606
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,833
That was the day
I photographed you.

607
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:22,379
And you asked me
to give you a year.

608
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,501
Perhaps to test me,

609
01:03:27,721 --> 01:03:32,466
perhaps to weary me,
or so you could forget.

610
01:03:34,102 --> 01:03:37,721
But time is unimportant.

611
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,523
I have come back for you now.

612
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,484
It's impossible.

613
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,116
It's impossible.

614
01:03:56,708 --> 01:03:58,199
Of course.

615
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,168
But you know that it <i>is</i> possible.

616
01:04:01,463 --> 01:04:04,297
You know you are ready to leave.

617
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:08,630
What makes you so sure?

618
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,677
Where would we go?

619
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,463
Anywhere.

620
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:18,512
We should really separate for ever.

621
01:04:19,189 --> 01:04:20,725
Last year...

622
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:26,276
You'll leave alone.

623
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,238
And forever we'll be...

624
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:36,120
Why should we be lonely
and have to wait forever?

625
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:37,780
It's not true.

626
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:41,496
But you're afraid.

627
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:43,706
No!

628
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,052
But now it's too late.

629
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:00,974
<i>He had just left your room.</i>

630
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:06,025
<i>You had just had some row with him.</i>

631
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,983
<i>You can see the garden.</i>

632
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:52,739
<i>You hadn't seen him leave.
That might have calmed you.</i>

633
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:55,817
<i>Then, you went back to the bed.</i>

634
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:59,078
<i>Not knowing where to go,</i>

635
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,203
<i>you went back to the bed again
and sat on it.</i>

636
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:07,499
<i>Then you let yourself fall back.</i>

637
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,502
<i>You went back to the bed,</i>

638
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:20,016
<i>after a few seconds of indecision,</i>

639
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,767
<i>not knowing what to do,</i>

640
01:06:21,936 --> 01:06:25,145
<i>staring in front of you.</i>

641
01:06:30,653 --> 01:06:33,361
<i>And you went back to the bed.</i>

642
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:39,531
<i>Listen to me! Try to remember.</i>

643
01:06:40,955 --> 01:06:43,242
<i>Please listen to me!</i>

644
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,914
<i>Yes, there was...</i>

645
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:51,331
<i>It's true. There was a big mirror.</i>

646
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,672
<i>You didn't dare go near it.</i>

647
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,881
<i>It seemed to frighten you.</i>

648
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:02,633
<i>You're determined not to believe me.</i>

649
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:05,723
<i>Where are you?
Where have you gone?</i>

650
01:07:05,897 --> 01:07:09,516
<i>Why try to run away?
It's too late.</i>

651
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:12,526
<i>It was too late even then.</i>

652
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,732
<i>The door was closed.</i>

653
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:16,989
<i>No! The door was closed!</i>

654
01:07:24,082 --> 01:07:27,792
<i>What more proof do you want?</i>

655
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:31,669
<i>I had a photo of you</i>

656
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:35,253
<i>taken just before you left.</i>

657
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:40,339
<i>You said the photo
didn't prove a thing.</i>

658
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:44,725
<i>Anyone could have taken it.</i>

659
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:48,182
<i>In any garden.</i>

660
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:53,605
<i>I should have shown you
the feathers.</i>

661
01:07:53,778 --> 01:07:56,942
<i>Your body a sea of feathers.</i>

662
01:07:57,365 --> 01:08:00,779
<i>But bodies and négligées
are all alike.</i>

663
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:04,036
<i>Hotels, statues,
and gardens are alike.</i>

664
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:09,458
<i>But for me, this garden was unique.</i>

665
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,038
<i>Every day,</i>

666
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,287
<i>I met you there.</i>

667
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:25,508
<i>One afternoon,
the next day no doubt,</i>

668
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:30,263
<i>I told you we're leaving.</i>

669
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,978
<i>No. You weren't laughing.</i>

670
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:37,270
<i>We'll leave tomorrow
and never return.</i>

671
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,863
<i>No,</i>

672
01:08:40,033 --> 01:08:41,399
<i>that wasn't it.</i>

673
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:45,027
<i>Yes. We were in your room.</i>

674
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,912
<i>We had already decided to leave.</i>

675
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:51,450
<i>You had agreed,
somewhat unwillingly.</i>

676
01:08:52,003 --> 01:08:54,165
<i>I was in your room.</i>

677
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:58,127
<i>From the doorway, you see the bed,</i>

678
01:08:59,218 --> 01:09:02,256
<i>but not the dressing table.</i>

679
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:05,632
<i>You were probably by the window,</i>

680
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:08,221
<i>looking down at the garden,
I think.</i>

681
01:09:08,686 --> 01:09:10,518
<i>I'm not quite sure.</i>

682
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:14,224
<i>I had met him
coming down the stairs.</i>

683
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,608
<i>He'd just left.</i>

684
01:09:17,195 --> 01:09:19,403
<i>Was it another day?</i>

685
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:24,366
<i>That evening, everything was empty.</i>

686
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:26,493
<i>The stairs,</i>

687
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,946
<i>the corridors,</i>

688
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,164
<i>the stairs.</i>

689
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:33,181
<i>I don't remember any more.</i>

690
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,222
<i>I don't remember myself.</i>

691
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,858
<i>I don't remember.</i>

692
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,487
Didn't you hear me knock?

693
01:10:52,081 --> 01:10:55,074
Yes. I told you to come in.

694
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,088
You must have spoken softly.

695
01:11:28,868 --> 01:11:30,951
What's this photograph?

696
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:34,830
An old one of me.

697
01:11:37,752 --> 01:11:38,959
When was it taken?

698
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,745
I don't know. Last year.

699
01:11:43,591 --> 01:11:45,207
Who took it?

700
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:48,468
I don't know. Frank, perhaps.

701
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:53,261
Frank wasn't here last year.

702
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:03,559
Perhaps it wasn't here.

703
01:12:04,445 --> 01:12:07,404
Perhaps it was in Frederiksbad.

704
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:11,116
Perhaps someone else took it.

705
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:18,331
How did you spend the afternoon?

706
01:12:18,501 --> 01:12:20,959
I just read a little.

707
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:26,586
I looked for you. Were you outside?

708
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:30,127
No. I was in the green room.

709
01:12:32,807 --> 01:12:34,799
I looked there though.

710
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,059
You'd something to tell me?

711
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:47,644
You seem worried.

712
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:49,984
I'm a little tired.

713
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:54,777
You must rest. Don't forget
that's what we're here for.

714
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,748
Going out?

715
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,585
I may go to the Gun Room.

716
01:13:03,754 --> 01:13:04,915
At this time?

717
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,339
Why not?

718
01:13:09,051 --> 01:13:13,261
Anderson's arriving tomorrow.
We'll have lunch with him,

719
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,798
if you've no other plans.

720
01:13:17,727 --> 01:13:20,970
What other plans?

721
01:13:21,147 --> 01:13:22,934
Till tonight then.

722
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:37,237
<i>When the door was shut,
you listened for his footsteps.</i>

723
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:42,784
<i>But you heard none. You didn't
even hear other doors closing.</i>

724
01:13:43,669 --> 01:13:46,582
<i>The way to the Gun Room
was via the terrace</i>

725
01:13:46,756 --> 01:13:49,123
<i>behind the hotel.</i>

726
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:54,466
<i>But unless you open the window,
you can't see the terrace.</i>

727
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:57,805
<i>You listened
for his footsteps on the gravel.</i>

728
01:13:57,975 --> 01:14:01,343
<i>With the window closed,
it was impossible to hear.</i>

729
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,972
<i>Besides, there's probably
no gravel just there.</i>

730
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:47,522
One arm reaching up
to your hair.

731
01:14:47,692 --> 01:14:51,857
An outstretched forefinger
to your lips,

732
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:55,022
as if to stifle a cry.

733
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,660
Now you're here again.

734
01:15:08,129 --> 01:15:11,088
No, this is not the proper ending.

735
01:15:11,257 --> 01:15:13,590
I need you alive.

736
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:19,137
Alive, you were every evening

737
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:22,265
for weeks and for months.

738
01:15:26,564 --> 01:15:29,728
I've never stayed anywhere
for so long.

739
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:32,608
Yes, I know.

740
01:15:41,162 --> 01:15:46,203
It's all the same to me.

741
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:56,675
Why don't you want to remember?

742
01:15:59,055 --> 01:16:00,921
You're mad!

743
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:05,722
I'm tired. Leave me.

744
01:18:47,765 --> 01:18:49,301
This game's absurd.

745
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,471
You must take an odd number.

746
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:56,103
The one who begins, loses.

747
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:59,641
Frank used to play last year.

748
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:03,361
You must take the complement
of seven.

749
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:09,072
Please begin.

750
01:19:11,664 --> 01:19:13,747
Which one shall I take?

751
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:19,289
This one.

752
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,979
I've lost, then.

753
01:20:50,054 --> 01:20:53,889
<i>It's not true. You were sincere.</i>

754
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,466
<i>Remember.</i>

755
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:01,729
<i>For days and days,
night after night...</i>

756
01:21:02,441 --> 01:21:06,856
<i>All bedrooms are the same,
you'll say.</i>

757
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,396
<i>But for me,
that room was different.</i>

758
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:13,154
<i>There were no doors, no corridors.</i>

759
01:21:16,413 --> 01:21:18,655
<i>Not even the garden.</i>

760
01:22:02,668 --> 01:22:07,208
<i>In the middle of the night,
the hotel slept.</i>

761
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:12,129
<i>We met each other outside,
as before.</i>

762
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,761
<i>You stopped
when you recognized me.</i>

763
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:20,225
<i>We stood there in silence.</i>

764
01:22:22,146 --> 01:22:25,435
<i>You stood waiting,</i>

765
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:29,267
<i>unable to move
either forward or back.</i>

766
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:34,777
<i>You stood motionless,</i>

767
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,862
<i>your arms by your sides.</i>

768
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:41,279
<i>You wore a long dark cape.</i>

769
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:44,499
<i>I think it was black.</i>

770
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,000
Listen to me, for pity's sake.

771
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,882
We can't turn back the past.

772
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,299
Only wait a little longer.

773
01:22:57,473 --> 01:23:01,683
Next year, the same day,
the same time, here.

774
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,514
I'll follow you.

775
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:09,103
Please. We must wait.

776
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:12,355
A year's not long.

777
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:16,693
For me it's nothing.

778
01:23:16,909 --> 01:23:17,909
But listen!

779
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,236
For how long must we put it off?

780
01:23:23,624 --> 01:23:25,035
I've waited too long.

781
01:23:26,668 --> 01:23:30,036
But what do you hope to achieve?

782
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:33,798
Do you think it's so easy?

783
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:38,048
I don't know.

784
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,889
Perhaps...

785
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:45,764
I'm not very brave.

786
01:23:48,065 --> 01:23:50,398
I can't put it off.

787
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:55,444
A few hours is all I ask.

788
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:01,651
A few months... a few hours.

789
01:24:01,828 --> 01:24:05,663
A few minutes or a few seconds.

790
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:11,791
It's as though
you couldn't decide to leave him,

791
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,085
as if it meant
parting with yourself.

792
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,462
As if his shape...

793
01:24:17,636 --> 01:24:21,755
Be quiet. Someone's coming!

794
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:38,563
Go away, if you love me!

795
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:30,449
You're feeling faint.

796
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:33,667
It's nothing.

797
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:36,086
You're better already.

798
01:25:37,591 --> 01:25:38,832
I'll go upstairs.

799
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:40,841
Shall I come with you?

800
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:44,504
No. I'd rather go alone.

801
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:47,298
I'm going.

802
01:26:08,330 --> 01:26:13,075
<i>And again I made my way
along these corridors,</i>

803
01:26:13,251 --> 01:26:16,460
<i>walking for days and months,</i>

804
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:19,873
<i>walking for years, towards you.</i>

805
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:24,760
<i>There can be no rest
within these walls.</i>

806
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:29,765
<i>I shall leave tonight
and take you with me.</i>

807
01:26:37,776 --> 01:26:41,190
<i>Had this story begun last year</i>

808
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:45,740
<i>with us waiting for each other,</i>

809
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:48,534
<i>one year ago,</i>

810
01:26:49,454 --> 01:26:55,075
<i>you couldn't have gone on
living in this setting,</i>

811
01:26:55,502 --> 01:26:58,245
<i>amongst these mirrors and pillars,</i>

812
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,456
<i>surrounded
by these swinging doors,</i>

813
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:04,258
<i>these giant stairways,</i>

814
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:07,344
<i>this ever open room.</i>

815
01:27:19,818 --> 01:27:22,401
Where are you, my lost love?

816
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:26,815
I'm here.

817
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,318
Here with you, in this room.

818
01:27:30,704 --> 01:27:34,288
But already it's no longer true.

819
01:27:37,836 --> 01:27:41,580
Please help me!

820
01:27:45,093 --> 01:27:47,130
<i>You were feeling better.</i>

821
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:51,598
<i>Yes, now you'll sleep</i>

822
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:56,804
<i>and wake already to meet Ackerson,</i>

823
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:58,562
<i>or Paterson,</i>

824
01:27:59,024 --> 01:28:01,266
<i>whom you're supposed
to lunch with.</i>

825
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,275
Don't let me go.

826
01:28:03,570 --> 01:28:05,732
You know it's too late.

827
01:28:07,616 --> 01:28:10,859
Tomorrow I'll be alone.

828
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:14,245
Your room will be empty.

829
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,655
No!

830
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:17,744
I'm cold.

831
01:28:20,879 --> 01:28:23,041
<i>You need nothing.</i>

832
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,709
<i>You don't know
what happened just now.</i>

833
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:31,630
<i>You don't remember.</i>

834
01:28:33,266 --> 01:28:37,010
<i>You're afraid you shocked them.</i>

835
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:45,481
<i>When this man, who maybe
is your husband, had gone,</i>

836
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:47,486
<i>this man you may even love,</i>

837
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:52,117
<i>whom you'll leave tonight
for ever,</i>

838
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:57,538
<i>you packed your things
and prepared a change of clothes.</i>

839
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:00,908
<i>We were to leave tonight.</i>

840
01:29:01,336 --> 01:29:06,627
<i>You seemed to want
to give him a chance.</i>

841
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:10,593
<i>I don't know. I accepted.</i>

842
01:29:11,096 --> 01:29:15,056
<i>He could have come
to take you back.</i>

843
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:19,890
<i>The hotel was deserted.</i>

844
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:24,516
<i>Everyone was at the play.</i>

845
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:27,894
<i>Your fainting gave you
an excuse not to go.</i>

846
01:29:28,071 --> 01:29:32,611
<i>I can't remember the title.</i>

847
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:36,281
<i>It was due to finish late.</i>

848
01:29:37,038 --> 01:29:40,202
<i>After he'd left you,
lying on your bed</i>

849
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:42,583
<i>he went to the theatre.</i>

850
01:29:42,752 --> 01:29:45,586
<i>He sat with a group of friends.</i>

851
01:29:46,047 --> 01:29:51,133
<i>If he really wanted to keep you,
he would have to leave before the end.</i>

852
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:58,549
<i>You were dressed, ready to go.</i>

853
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:02,220
<i>You sat waiting for him alone</i>

854
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:07,688
<i>in a lounge adjoining your suite.</i>

855
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:12,780
<i>You'd asked me
to leave you till midnight.</i>

856
01:30:14,326 --> 01:30:17,490
<i>Were you hoping he would come?</i>

857
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:21,872
<i>I thought you might
have told him everything</i>

858
01:30:22,042 --> 01:30:24,876
<i>and fixed a time for him to come.</i>

859
01:30:25,587 --> 01:30:30,503
<i>Or perhaps you thought
I might not come myself.</i>

860
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:39,723
<i>I came at the appointed time.</i>

861
01:32:48,897 --> 01:32:50,604
<i>The grounds of the hotel</i>

862
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:53,517
<i>were symmetrically arranged,</i>

863
01:32:54,194 --> 01:32:59,565
<i>without trees or flowers,
or plants of any kind.</i>

864
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:04,410
<i>The gravel,
the stone and the marble</i>

865
01:33:04,579 --> 01:33:08,698
<i>were spread in strict array</i>

866
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,367
<i>in unmysterious shapes.</i>

867
01:33:12,337 --> 01:33:16,672
<i>At first sight, it seemed
impossible to lose your way.</i>

868
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:18,840
<i>At first sight...</i>

869
01:33:19,219 --> 01:33:25,307
<i>Along these stone paths
and amidst these statues,</i>

870
01:33:26,017 --> 01:33:29,852
<i>where you were already</i>

871
01:33:30,021 --> 01:33:33,981
<i>losing your way for ever</i>

872
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:36,642
<i>in the still night,</i>

873
01:33:36,820 --> 01:33:39,608
<i>alone with me.</i>
