1
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,104
Can I do this? What do I do?
Shall I do this?

2
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,318
- Okay.
- There.

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:43,495
I don't have a plate yet.
I've had four in front of me.

4
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,814
How do you like, white or dry?

5
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,586
This one doesn't have any meat.

6
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:50,127
- Here it is.
- I like white and dark.

7
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,136
Well, give this to whoever's done.

8
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:07,895
We've got two tons of potatoes.

9
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,814
Tom. Tom.

10
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,815
I'll drink to that.

11
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,717
Did you know the subject,
Thomas Gruneman?

12
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:35,964
Yes.

13
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,261
Very well?

14
00:01:38,056 --> 00:01:39,592
He was my best friend.

15
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,428
We grew up together.

16
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:46,475
Can you account
for his disappearance in any way?

17
00:01:47,524 --> 00:01:49,015
- Mrs. Gruneman?
- No.

18
00:01:50,444 --> 00:01:55,656
Did he recently appear to be agitated
or depressed in any way?

19
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:56,741
No.

20
00:01:58,702 --> 00:02:01,285
Now, Mr. Cable, at the plant,

21
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:05,991
did he voice any grievance
or discontent about his work there?

22
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:10,707
No, not at all. Tom operated best
when he was under pressure.

23
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,380
Please forgive me, Mrs. Gruneman,
but I have to ask.

24
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,255
Did your husband ever show...

25
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,884
any moral or sexual problems
or peculiarities?

26
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,385
No. No.

27
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:25,184
Any marital problems in general, that is?

28
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,140
We were very happy.

29
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:32,350
Did he ever mention, specifically,
a girl or a woman in New York City?

30
00:02:32,903 --> 00:02:33,939
No.

31
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:37,109
- No.
- Why?

32
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,240
We recovered in his desk at the plant,
in one of the drawers,

33
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:45,037
a letter, a typewritten letter,

34
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:48,412
that was evidently written
on the Friday before he disappeared.

35
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,918
It was written to a girl in New York City,

36
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,215
and we contacted the police.

37
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,293
They brought her in, questioned her,

38
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:02,006
and she said that she had received
six or seven letters of this kind.

39
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,180
Can I see it?

40
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:08,386
Well, it's an obscene letter,
Mrs. Gruneman.

41
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:11,267
I would like to see it.

42
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,733
I'd like you to remember that
it was written by a very disturbed man.

43
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,031
I don't believe it.

44
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:38,834
I'd like you to know that situations of
this kind are not unique, Mrs. Gruneman.

45
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,216
A man will lead... a double life,

46
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,015
a Jekyll-and-Hyde existence,
and his wife has no idea what's going on.

47
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:18,749
<i>Has anybody talked to you
about the financial arrangements?</i>

48
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,794
<i>Well, that depends, naturally,
on how long you want me for...</i>

49
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,134
<i>and what you want to do.</i>

50
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:30,889
<i>I know you.</i>

51
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:33,646
<i>It will be very nice.</i>

52
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,316
<i>Well, I'd like to spend the evening
with you if it's...</i>

53
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,103
<i>if you'd like that.</i>

54
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:45,116
<i>Have you ever been
with a woman before, paying her?</i>

55
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:46,783
<i>Do you like it?</i>

56
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,864
<i>I mean, I have a feeling that
that turns you on very particularly.</i>

57
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:56,161
<i>What turns me on is because
I have a good imagination,</i>

58
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:58,997
<i>and I like... pleasing.</i>

59
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:02,254
<i>Do you mind if I take my sweater off?</i>

60
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,004
<i>I think in the confines of one's house,
one should be</i>

61
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,924
<i>free of clothing and inhibitions.</i>

62
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:14,016
<i>Inhibitions are always nice 'cause
they're so nice to overcome</i>.

63
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,307
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

64
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,191
<i>I'm not.</i>

65
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:23,901
<i>As long as you don't hurt me
more than I like to be hurt...</i>

66
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,653
<i>I will do anything you ask.</i>

67
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,617
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that. You mustn't be.</i>

68
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,574
<i>You know, there's nothing wrong.
Nothing is wrong.</i>

69
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,378
<i>I think the only way
that any of us can ever be happy</i>

70
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:43,128
<i>is to let it all hang out, you know.</i>

71
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:45,756
<i>Do it all and fuck it.</i>

72
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:53,517
- Hi. Would you stand up, please?
- Hi.

73
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:00,179
- Hello.
- Hi.

74
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:04,191
Okay. Hi. Can I see your eyes?
Let me see your hair.

75
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:07,148
- Take your hair... your hat off.
- Take my hair off?

76
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,858
Yeah. Okay.

77
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:11,069
- Too pretty.
- Too pretty.

78
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,988
- She's kind of exotic.
- That's the coloring.

79
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,532
The coloring is great.
Yeah, I don't know.

80
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,334
- It's not quite it though.
- No, not really.

81
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:21,621
Hello. Can I see your hands?

82
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,360
- Mmm.
- Thank you.

83
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,376
- She has some funny hands.
- Yeah.

84
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,173
- No.
- No.

85
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:31,464
- Hi.
- She is great. Beautiful eyes.

86
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,470
Yes, lovely. That's the coloring.

87
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,392
Yeah. Let me see you smile.

88
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,559
- I think she has that cross between...
- She's great. But I've seen you before.

89
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,419
- I think so.
- Have you done any cosmetic ads?

90
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:43,150
- Yes, I have.
- You have?

91
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,819
How could they send us
people with a conflict?

92
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,884
- I don't believe this.
- Call that agency.

93
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,388
- Irene Dunne would've had it.
- That would be perfect.

94
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,236
- C minus.
- C minus.

95
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,242
Got to find her today.

96
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,824
- Okay, that's it. Thank you, ladies.
- Thank you.

97
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,375
Bring the next group, please.

98
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:13,302
I'm exhausted. One more day
of this, and I'll pull out my hair.

99
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,051
Hello. Hi.

100
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,262
Okay, ladies,
just have a seat, please.

101
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,434
It's been six months.

102
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,979
Tom Gruneman's been missing
for half a year.

103
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:30,482
And all the FBI has to offer is a report
that must bore even you.

104
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:34,451
There are thousands
of honest, decent men

105
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,028
who simply disappear every year.

106
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:40,332
Neither Mrs. Gruneman nor I
are willing to just dismiss this case.

107
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,036
Therefore we feel entitled
to investigate on our own.

108
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:45,920
You're entitled.

109
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,839
There are some very competent...

110
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,839
John Klute offered us his services,
and we've accepted.

111
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,135
Klute knew Tom, and he has
a great many ideas about the case.

112
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:57,467
You ever done
any missing persons work before?

113
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,520
No.

114
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,597
Have you spent
any time in the city?

115
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:03,691
No.

116
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,061
Speaking frankly...

117
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,268
You're wondering
why we thought of Klute.

118
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,779
Frankly.

119
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:10,862
He's interested.

120
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,240
And he cares.

121
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,866
Why didn't you ever find out
anything from that girl?

122
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,865
We held her under surveillance,

123
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:24,081
expecting your boy Gruneman
to show up there.

124
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,713
He didn't. We arrested her on a CP charge.

125
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,837
Convicted. Two months women's city prison.

126
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,216
Offered to reduce sentence,
she cooperated.

127
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:37,719
<i>She thought she remembered Gruneman
from those letters from before.</i>

128
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,345
<i>She made that connection.</i>

129
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,600
<i>But she hadn't seen him since then
and couldn't identify his photograph.</i>

130
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,688
<i>A good call girl,</i>

131
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,524
<i>she'll turn 600 or 700 tricks a year.</i>

132
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:49,484
<i>Faces get blurred.</i>

133
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,396
<i>And since then,
she's reported several incidents,</i>

134
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,733
<i>like breather calls,
anonymous phone calls.</i>

135
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:59,036
<i>Also, somebody may be following her,
watching her.</i>

136
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:00,579
<i>Things like that.</i>

137
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:04,409
<i>So I guess it's conceivable
that Gruneman's still around there.</i>

138
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,834
<i>Still bugging her.</i>

139
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,829
Hey, Trina. Bree.

140
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:12,709
Listen, I could use a quick 50.
You got a commuter for me?

141
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,345
Terrific.

142
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,682
Yeah.

143
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,809
Right.

144
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,141
Terrific. Yeah. Bye.

145
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,839
Hi. I'm Bree.

146
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,883
Yeah. Uh, come in, please.

147
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:57,837
I'm glad to know you, Bree.

148
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,551
I'm glad you could come.

149
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:02,553
Sit down, please.

150
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,522
- Um...
- Where you from?

151
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,353
Can I get you a drink?

152
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,686
I'd like a ginger ale. Thank you.
That would be nice.

153
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,942
I'm from Chicago.

154
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,982
You come to New York often?

155
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:22,161
Often? No, I don't come
to New York too often.

156
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,161
- Two or three times a year, maybe.
- That's too bad.

157
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,553
What kind of party did you have in mind?

158
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:43,132
We could...

159
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:48,061
We could have a nice
half-and-half party for 50.

160
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:49,809
Mm-hmm.

161
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,765
We could have a good time for 50.

162
00:10:52,569 --> 00:10:55,152
Or if you wanted something extra,
it would be a little more.

163
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:59,236
Um... Yeah. Have...

164
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:04,908
- Maybe a nice...
- Listen, would it be all right...

165
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,078
- Tell me. What do you want? Tell me.
- I mean...

166
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:14,459
Tell me what you want. Hmm?

167
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,633
Oh, wow.

168
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,387
Wow. That sounds fantastic.

169
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:28,144
That's so exciting,
but it's going to cost you more.

170
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,139
That's fantastic.

171
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,769
That's going to be 100.

172
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,902
- Sure. Fine. Oh, yes. Very good.
- Yeah.

173
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,732
- 100.
- Very good.

174
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,035
Mmm. I like to get business out of the way
at the beginning.

175
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,579
That way we don't have to think about it.
Then we can...

176
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,037
just have a good time.

177
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:54,211
Mmm. I like your mind.

178
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,298
- Yeah.
- So.

179
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,465
Chicago.

180
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:19,277
Is this the bed?

181
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,781
This is the bed.

182
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,202
Very nice. Very nice. Very nice.

183
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,894
There's the bed in operating position.

184
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,025
You're so nice.

185
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,953
Come here. Come here.

186
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,717
Oh, my angel. Oh, my angel.

Hello?

198
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,876
Who is it?

199
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,124
Miss Daniel, my name is Klute. John Klute.

200
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,546
- I'd like to talk to you.
- What do you want?

201
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,841
My name is John Klute.

202
00:18:57,762 --> 00:18:58,762
You said that.

203
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,556
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you
some questions about Tom Gruneman.

204
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:06,890
- Who?
- Tom Gruneman. He wrote you some letters.

205
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:09,138
Wow.

206
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,438
He was a research engineer

207
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,982
at the Tuscarora Laboratories
in Pennsylvania,

208
00:19:13,444 --> 00:19:15,606
and he disappeared from there
last December.

209
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:18,655
- And I've been hired to look for him.
- Why?

210
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,151
You know what I'm talking about,
Miss Daniel.

211
00:19:23,204 --> 00:19:24,204
Honest.

212
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,742
Can I ask you some questions, please?

213
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,663
Do you have any identification?

214
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,382
You're not a cop?

215
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,804
You're not FBI?

216
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,515
You're a private detective?

217
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,768
And you just want to ask me
some questions.

218
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:49,854
Uh-huh.

219
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,013
They're not very recent.
That's last year.

220
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,467
They're quite good. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

221
00:20:30,104 --> 00:20:34,018
Tell me, what have you done that I might
have seen on Broadway or off-Broadway?

222
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,729
Well, I study with George Tainter.

223
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:40,187
George? George is very good.
He's a good man to begin with.

224
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:44,240
And I've been in two of his productions...
workshop-type productions.

225
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,612
Workshop.

226
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,490
They're very nice. Very nice.

227
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:50,994
Tell me, how do you feel
about being an actress?

228
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,166
- I like it very much.
- Mm-hmm.

229
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,289
- Do you think you know yourself?
- I like acting.

230
00:20:57,548 --> 00:21:00,291
- As much as anybody, I guess.
- Do you really know yourself?

231
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,750
- No.
- That's very important.

232
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,882
- I forget myself when I act.
- No, you can't forget yourself.

233
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:08,010
You have to know yourself
and kind of like yourself.

234
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,557
You have to relate.

235
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,804
- Relate to people.
- Mmm.

236
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,852
I had an identity crisis two years ago,

237
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,521
and since then,
I've been working to know myself.

238
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,599
That's very important. Very...

239
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,685
Don't hide your face.

240
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,772
You have a nice face.
Excuse me. Just a second.

241
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,037
Jillian? Yes, okay, send her in.

242
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,665
Well, I'm very busy.
It was wonderful for you to stop by.

243
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,868
If you're in anything
off-off-Broadway or...

244
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,583
How are you today?

245
00:21:41,926 --> 00:21:43,883
I'm not gonna be able
to come back anymore.

246
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,210
I'm sorry.

247
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,429
Because I just can't afford it.

248
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,678
Did I fail you, Bree?

249
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,475
I've been coming here all this time
and paying you all this money.

250
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,055
Why do I still want to trick?

251
00:21:57,149 --> 00:22:01,439
Why do I still walk by a phone
and want to pick up the phone and call?

252
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:04,358
Did you think I had some magic potion?

253
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,403
You'd come in and tell me
what your problem was,

254
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,029
and I would just take it away?

255
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,496
What's the difference between going out
on a call as a model or as an actress,

256
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:14,582
and as a call girl?

257
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,158
You're successful as a call girl...

258
00:22:16,252 --> 00:22:19,620
Because when you're a call girl,
you control it, that's why.

259
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:23,127
Because someone wants you.

260
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:25,918
Not me.

261
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:29,470
I mean, there are some johns
that I have regularly that want <i>me,</i>

262
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:30,673
and that's terrific,

263
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,966
but they want a woman.

264
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,639
And I know I'm good.

265
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:40,520
And I arrive at their hotel
or their apartment...

266
00:22:42,945 --> 00:22:47,360
and they're usually nervous,
which is fine, because I'm not.

267
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,656
I know what I'm doing.

268
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,073
And for an hour...

269
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,408
for an hour,
I'm the best actress in the world,

270
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,242
and the best fuck in the world.

271
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,543
And...

272
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,417
Why'd you say you're the best actress
in the world at that time?

273
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,250
Because it's an act.
That's what's nice about it.

274
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,756
You don't have to feel anything.
You don't have to...

275
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,056
care about anything.

276
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,428
You don't have to like anybody.
You just...

277
00:23:18,105 --> 00:23:19,346
You just...

278
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,231
lead them by the ring in their nose

279
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,731
in the direction
they think they want to go in.

280
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:29,447
And you get a lot of money out of them
in as short a period of time as possible.

281
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,614
And you control it,
and you call the shots.

282
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,787
And I always feel just great afterwards.

283
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,332
- And you enjoyed it?
- No.

284
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:41,920
Why not?

285
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,915
- You said there's nothing wrong with it.
- There's a difference...

286
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:49,672
I don't think there's anything wrong
with it... morally.

287
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,799
I didn't enjoy it physically.

288
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:57,308
I... I came to enjoy it
because it made me feel good.

289
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,438
It made me feel like I wasn't alone.

290
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,139
It made me feel...

291
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,195
that I had some control over myself,

292
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:12,069
that I had some control over my life,

293
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:15,030
that I could determine things for myself.

294
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,038
<i>Oh, I don't know.
I don't know why I'm here.</i>

295
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:23,122
<i>It's so silly to think that somebody else
can help anybody, isn't it?</i>

296
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,970
<i>I could come over tonight. Are you alone?</i>

297
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,764
<i>In about an hour.</i>

298
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:40,260
<i>Okay. See you in an hour.</i>

299
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,168
Bree.

300
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:57,466
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

301
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,592
Here.

302
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:05,897
Enjoy.

303
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,977
- It's good to see you again.
- Likewise.

304
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:16,190
I just got back from Cannes, you know.

305
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:18,740
And I...

306
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:26,704
well, I have something rather exciting
to tell you.

307
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:27,794
Yes?

308
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,496
Cannes was very amusing.

309
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,666
We played baccarat and chemin de fer.

310
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,421
And a very nice little Italian marquis
was rather enthusiastic about me.

311
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:46,186
But a young man can be so silly.

312
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,807
And then one night...

313
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,694
at the gambling tables...

314
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,734
I saw him.

315
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,400
A stranger. He was looking at me.

316
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,538
He was standing very still
on the other side of the room.

317
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,909
And his eyes were looking right into me.

318
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,709
And I knew that,
for the first time in my life...

319
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,127
Please.

320
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,012
Not young. He wasn't young.

321
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,847
He had gray sideburns.

322
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:32,766
- Actually, he looked rather like you.
- Yes?

323
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,526
No one could tell me who he was.

324
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,697
Was he an exiled prince or a mercenary?

325
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:50,000
But there was a feeling stirring
inside me, a pagan feeling.

326
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,457
And the next day on the beach,
in my beach pavilion...

327
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,419
it was so warm on the sand.

328
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:03,300
And I saw him again.

329
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,300
He was staring at me.

330
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,972
His eyes were burning into me.

331
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:17,068
I was helpless.

332
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,981
He didn't even have to say anything,
and I knew.

333
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,034
I knew that somehow...

334
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,742
I've never liked young men.

335
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,047
And I knew that...

336
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,633
that he would awaken something in me...

337
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,881
that no young man had ever awakened.

338
00:28:50,062 --> 00:28:51,062
He was...

339
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,721
He was so wise.

340
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,895
And he taught me so many things...

341
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,611
with his hands...

342
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,690
and with his mind.

343
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,617
I felt so beautiful.

344
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,343
Miss Daniels. Can I come upstairs
and ask you some questions now?

345
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,019
You bastard.

346
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,069
Is this the shakedown, hon?

347
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,736
- You picked a loser. I don't have it.
- I'm looking for Tom...

348
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,490
Jesus. You think I'd be living in this kip
if I were taking calls full-time?

349
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,945
I'd be back on Park Avenue.

350
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,655
Can I ask you some questions?

351
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,997
Or you'll get me thrown back in the brig,
you mean?

352
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:26,238
Have a seat.

353
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,116
Would you like some wine?

354
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,164
- Or some beer?
- No, thank you.

355
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,869
There isn't any beer anyway.

356
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,886
Look, I've already told the police
everything I know.

357
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:50,929
I don't even remember the schlub.

358
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,604
Yeah, they showed me that already.

359
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,814
- I understand this is Gruneman.
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,517
I told them, I don't remember.

361
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,610
Family-type man, it figures.

362
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:19,706
Look, will you please just try to get it
from my side?

363
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,415
A year ago...

364
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,339
I was in the life full-time,

365
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:27,167
living on Park Avenue.

366
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,922
This very nice apartment,
leather furniture.

367
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,388
And then the cops dropped on me,
they caged me.

368
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,969
Started asking me about a guy,

369
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,976
some guy that I'm supposed
to have seen a year before that.

370
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,307
Two years ago!

371
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:44,688
He could be in Yemen.

372
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,856
Gruneman, what does that mean?
It's a name. I don't know him.

373
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:53,364
They start showing me these pictures,
and they don't mean anything to me.

374
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,954
Then they started asking me
if I'd been getting letters

375
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,244
from some guy out in Cabbageville.

376
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,415
Tuscarora.

377
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,290
Yeah, all right, I had been.

378
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,752
Very sick letters.

379
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,881
So they said, "Well, that's Gruneman."

380
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,214
So would you please tell us
when you and he...

381
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,929
Well, there was a guy... once, a freak.

382
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:25,266
Could have been him. Apparently,
Gruneman liked to beat up on girls.

383
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:29,775
And, well, this guy hired me
and then he tried to kill me.

384
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:31,356
That was about two years ago.

385
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,073
Tommy baby, olly, olly, in free, kid.
I got the gumdrops.

386
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,284
You remind me of my uncle.

387
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,418
What else do you remember
about the man who beat you up?

388
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,676
Nothing.

389
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,837
Except that he wasn't kidding, that's all.

390
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,847
See, usually it's a fake out.

391
00:32:57,142 --> 00:32:58,633
You probably know about that.

392
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,540
They pretend to tie you up,
you wear a dress with a cloth belt,

393
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,021
and they pretend to whip you.

394
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,773
It's their money, I don't care.

395
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,398
I'll swing from a shower rod
and whistle "Maytime,"

396
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:12,731
except this guy really freaked out on it.

397
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,322
But you cannot identify this man
as Tom Gruneman?

398
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,653
I can't identify him as anybody.

399
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,751
So... is that it?

400
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:31,708
Listen...

401
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,553
why don't you go downstairs...

402
00:33:37,516 --> 00:33:39,132
You have such a nice mouth.

403
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:40,717
...and get those tapes,

404
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,306
and bring them back up here...

405
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,852
and we'll have a party, you and I?

406
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:48,103
Wouldn't that be nice?

407
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,981
What about afterwards,
about the telephone calls?

408
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,358
Just phone calls, right?

409
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,866
What is it? The phone rings,
you answer, there's nobody there.

410
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,477
Kids getting their kicks, burglars
finding out if the apartment's empty.

411
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,209
It happens all the time in New York.
It doesn't mean anything.

412
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,287
You reported that you had been followed.

413
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,210
Look, I'm sorry.
I've been... leading everybody astray.

414
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,464
It doesn't...

415
00:34:17,514 --> 00:34:19,471
Yeah, okay, I get these feelings,

416
00:34:19,975 --> 00:34:22,137
but they're just feelings, that's just me.

417
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:27,438
I'm sure you'll find this amusing,

418
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,811
but I'm afraid of the dark.

419
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:36,148
Or sometimes I get spooked.
I think I see people, hear things.

420
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:39,655
Or I go out in the morning and think
somebody's been prying open my mailbox.

421
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:43,863
Or if there's trash in front of my door,
I think somebody's trying to freak me out.

422
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,956
It's just nerves. I'm a nervous broad.
It doesn't mean anything.

423
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,592
Bree Daniels.

424
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,884
How is Ted? Yeah.

425
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,193
Thank you. Thank you very much.

426
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,236
I'd love to.
Maybe the next time you're in town?

427
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:23,194
I'd like to meet you very much.
You've got a nice voice.

428
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:25,581
I...

429
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,911
Actually, I'm having a conversation
with a very nice cop.

430
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:35,123
He's not a cop actually,
he's a private de...

431
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:43,923
Is that how you get most of your dates?

432
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,509
Somebody gives your name to somebody else?

433
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:47,764
Most of them, yeah.

434
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,180
And that how you met the man
who beat you up?

435
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,728
I don't remember.
It was two years ago. God.

436
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,730
How else do you get dates then, pimps?

437
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,901
Oh, you're very square, cookie.

438
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,984
No, pimps don't get dates for you,
they just take your money.

439
00:36:05,038 --> 00:36:08,122
The police have given me a list of names.

440
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,744
I'd like to ask you about them.
Frank Ligourin?

441
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,289
I'm sure this is gonna amuse you too.

442
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,466
But I'm trying to get away from all that.

443
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,169
What about this evening, the old man?

444
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,802
You saw that? Goddamn you!

445
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,434
He's 70 years old.

446
00:36:30,063 --> 00:36:31,063
His wife is dead,

447
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:34,060
he's been cutting garments
since he was 14.

448
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,961
He's maybe in his whole life
had one week vacation,

449
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,351
and I'm all he's got.

450
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:39,186
And he never lays a hand on me.

451
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:41,147
What harm is there in that?

452
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,535
And what's your bag, Klute?
What do you like?

453
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,704
You a talker? A button freak?

454
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:52,537
Like to have your chest walked around
with high-heel shoes?

455
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,994
- Like to have us watch you tinkle?
- Okay.

456
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,630
Or do you get it off
wearing women's clothes?

457
00:36:57,966 --> 00:37:00,333
- Goddamn hypocrite squares!
- Okay.

458
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,963
I hope this isn't going
to make my cold any worse.

459
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,384
Now tell me about Frank Ligourin.

460
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,350
He was my old man. We broke up.

461
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,898
When? When did you break up?

462
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,566
About eight months ago.

463
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,690
Would you mind not doing that, ple...

464
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:23,532
What?

465
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,618
Okay?

466
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,623
Well, I thought I could trade you
for those tapes.

467
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,036
Doesn't it get lonely down there
in your little room?

468
00:37:39,007 --> 00:37:42,216
Maybe I could bring you some friends.
I've got some terrific friends.

469
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:43,302
No, thank you.

470
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,088
Men have paid $200 for me,
and here you are turning down a freebie.

471
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:49,766
You could get
a perfectly good dishwasher for that.

472
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:07,400
What are you doing with my keys?

473
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:08,494
Give me your hand.

474
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,462
I knew it.

475
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:27,378
Oh.

476
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:33,096
Don't be afraid.
I'm going to sit you down on the bed.

477
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:37,972
There's someone on the roof.

478
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,935
Sit. Sit!

479
00:40:54,786 --> 00:40:55,786
Tom?

480
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,835
Tom?

481
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,943
- You didn't get him.
- No.

482
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,572
Was it Gruneman?

483
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,289
I didn't see him.

484
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,084
Who sent you on that date?

485
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:56,546
Frankie Ligourin.

486
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,518
You and I will go talk
to Frank Ligourin tomorrow.

487
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:41,507
<i>Don't be afraid. I'm not.</i>

488
00:42:45,605 --> 00:42:47,187
<i>Would you like me to hold you?</i>

489
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,642
<i>I'm just trying to figure you out.</i>

490
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:56,112
<i>I may say, not many people
have been very successful at that.</i>

491
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,784
<i>That's all right. I'll figure
you out before the evening is over.</i>

492
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,699
<i>I hope you do.
And, in a way, I hope you don't.</i>

493
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:12,751
<i>The only responsibility
you have to me is to enjoy yourself.</i>

494
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:16,959
<i>Inhibitions are always nice
'cause they're so nice to overcome.</i>

495
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:19,462
<i>'Cause I'm very bad. I...</i>

496
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,512
<i>In what way? How are you bad?</i>

497
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,058
<i>In my head, I have very wicked ideas.</i>

498
00:43:27,188 --> 00:43:28,269
<i>Lots of them.</i>

499
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:30,555
<i>I'm sure as you're sitting
at your great desk,</i>

500
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,734
<i>you have all kinds ofstrange things
going through your mind.</i>

501
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,233
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that.</i>

502
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,150
<i>Nothing is wrong.</i>

503
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,527
<i>You know that I will do anything you ask.</i>

504
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:48,992
<i>I think the only way that any of us
can ever be happy is to...</i>

505
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,292
<i>is to let it all hang out.</i>

506
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,762
I was just finishing up some work,

507
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,468
mocking up a few photographs.

508
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:10,388
I used to be a photographer.
Bree tell you?

509
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,481
Before I got into publishing.

510
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,140
He knows you're a pimp, Frankie.

511
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:17,898
He knows you were my pimp.

512
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:21,611
Excuse me.
Bree, why don't you wait outside?

513
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:32,163
I always respected Bree.
I'd like to make something clear.

514
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:35,121
- I just got a couple of questions.
- I want to make something clear.

515
00:44:36,132 --> 00:44:38,966
You know, I don't go after a girl.

516
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,419
Girl comes to me.

517
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:44,296
Her choice. Right?

518
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,472
I'm looking for a man, Tom Gruneman.

519
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,552
Miss Daniels tells me the date
that beat her up two years ago

520
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:50,806
might've been that man,

521
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,638
and that you sent her on that date.

522
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:54,769
Two years ago? Sorry.

523
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:59,106
I understand you use narcotics.

524
00:44:59,197 --> 00:45:03,908
Maybe I could have someone come over
and look at your... arms.

525
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:07,403
I may stand better with the cops
than you do.

526
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,702
Why don't you sit down and relax?

527
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,543
It was a family matter
between the girls.

528
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,212
Had two other girls then,
two other girls besides Bree.

529
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:29,091
One of them, Jane McKenna,

530
00:45:30,019 --> 00:45:33,228
she blows a little jealous of Bree,
you know?

531
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:35,518
Bree comes first.

532
00:45:36,484 --> 00:45:40,023
And evidently she knew this freak,
beats up on women.

533
00:45:40,905 --> 00:45:43,022
She cons me into passing him on to Bree.

534
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,736
So Bree'd get hurt.

535
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:48,819
I didn't know till afterwards.

536
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,198
You can't tell them that one of their own
in-laws laid a freak on them.

537
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:55,618
Peace in the family.

538
00:45:57,463 --> 00:46:00,046
Beyond that, I don't know.

539
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:01,877
That's all she wrote.

540
00:46:05,179 --> 00:46:06,215
Did you see the man?

541
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:08,807
No.

542
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,476
How can I get hold of Jane McKenna?

543
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,598
Baby, would I be telling you all this?

544
00:46:18,234 --> 00:46:19,770
She copped out long ago.

545
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,686
She committed suicide, Baxter.

546
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,280
And the other girl, what's her name?

547
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,032
- Arlyn.
- Arlyn...

548
00:46:31,122 --> 00:46:32,122
Page.

549
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:33,531
How do I find her?

550
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,833
I don't know. She's a junkie.

551
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:41,588
Make that scene, you could be anywhere.
Here, San Francisco. They just drop out.

552
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,168
Anything else?

553
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,846
Did you like my friend Frankie?

554
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,640
Not very much.

555
00:46:56,731 --> 00:47:00,566
- Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
- Where can I find Arlyn Page?

556
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:04,027
You're not going to find Arlyn Page.
She's a junkie.

557
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,064
Didn't he tell you
that he sent me that guy?

558
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:10,409
Jane McKenna sent you that guy.

559
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:16,791
Well, she's dead.

560
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,626
Hey.

561
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:25,124
Your tapes.

562
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:30,008
Golly gee, just what I've always wanted.
Dirty phone calls. Ah!

563
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,183
What for?

564
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:37,765
I'm through with your part of it.
You told me what you could.

565
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,273
Well, tell me, Klute.

566
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,689
Did we get you a little, huh?
Just a little bit?

567
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:46,270
Us city folk?

568
00:47:46,364 --> 00:47:49,607
The sin, the glitter, the wickedness, huh?

569
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,276
All that's so pathetic.

570
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,496
Fuck off.

571
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,471
I'll tell you something, Jack.

572
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:16,592
It is in the bells that I hear my voices.

573
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,684
Not today when they all rang.
That was nothing but jangling.

574
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:26,235
But here, in this corner,
where the bells come down from heaven

575
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,061
and the echoes linger...

576
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:33,738
or in the fields where they come across
the quiet of the countryside,

577
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,444
my voices are in them.

578
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,365
- Hark.
- Not so... Gently.

579
00:48:42,086 --> 00:48:43,202
Do you hear?

580
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,586
<i>♪ Dear child of God ♪</i>

581
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,380
That's just what you said.

582
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,959
At the half hour, they will say:

583
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,386
<i>♪ Be brave, go on ♪</i>

584
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,765
At the three-quarters, they will say:

585
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,594
<i>♪ I am thy help ♪</i>

586
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:05,558
But it is at the hour
when the great bell goes after:

587
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:09,440
<i>♪ God will save France ♪</i>

588
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:12,238
It is then that St. Margaret
and St. Cath...

589
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,940
Thank you. Thank you very much.

590
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,327
Script, please.

591
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,516
- Very interesting accent.
- Thank you.

592
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,540
Booth.

593
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,379
Thank you.

594
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,520
All right. So what do you want, cop?

595
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,599
I can't find Arlyn Page without your help.

596
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:48,354
I told you you wouldn't find her.

597
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:52,404
If I can't find her, I can't find him.
If I can't find him, you're in trouble.

598
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,697
So what do you say?

599
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:57,911
Okay?

600
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,419
It's going to cost. Time is money.

601
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,667
Okay, well, I can pay you $100.

602
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,875
A hundred dollars.
I can make that at a lunch break.

603
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,709
A hundred dollars is all I've got.

604
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,970
Hey, you were very good upstairs.

605
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,227
Kid, will you buy me a coffee?

606
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,646
- Buy you lunch. You want lunch?
- Mmm.

607
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,019
Come on.

608
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,734
Whenever it suits you.

609
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,814
No, make it Monday at 8:00 p.m.

610
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:41,870
I said, Monday, 8:00 p.m., baby.
Now, don't be naughty.

611
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,122
He's a lovely man.

612
00:50:49,964 --> 00:50:54,550
Comes here, spends a bundle of money,
and never even touches the girls.

613
00:50:54,635 --> 00:50:58,094
Comes from Grosse Pointe,
has a big house, eight servants,

614
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:02,132
but all he wants to do is come here
and scrub out my bathroom.

615
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:07,061
8:00 p.m., Monday, Mr. Clean.

616
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:15,028
Now, Arlyn Page, I had to let her go.

617
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,235
No. With the kind of people I get here,

618
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,284
I couldn't have a gal
who was half zonked out all the time.

619
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:24,620
You know, I get the crème de la crème.

620
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,664
No, she was trouble.

621
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:29,952
And I don't allow any trouble here.

622
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,041
<i>Che cipuò fare?</i>

623
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,042
<i>Honi soit qui mal y pense.</i>

624
00:51:37,136 --> 00:51:39,549
Do you have any idea
where I can look for her?

625
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,390
Oh, try Momma Reese's.

626
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:50,189
Bree... if you ever get lonely,
or you haven't got any place else to go,

627
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,274
you come here.

628
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,725
You'll always have a home here.

629
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:06,539
Why?

630
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,330
She's a junkie.

631
00:52:09,585 --> 00:52:12,168
She was with you after she left Frankie,
wasn't she?

632
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,121
Well, she's not now.

633
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,167
I tried to do everything for her.

634
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,466
I took her into my own place,
my own little flat on 1st.

635
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,013
You know that sweet place?

636
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:27,555
We could've had everything together,
everything.

637
00:52:28,604 --> 00:52:30,516
Then the bitch sold my mink.

638
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:34,940
Do you know anybody that's seen her,
at all?

639
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:37,314
As far as I'm concerned, she's dead.

640
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:44,827
Okay.

641
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:03,529
Who is it?

642
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,907
Bree Daniels.

643
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,831
I couldn't sleep.

644
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:16,784
I keep thinking I hear noises.

645
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,208
Can I come in?

646
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,219
Come in, yeah.

647
00:54:39,651 --> 00:54:41,171
Oh, it's probably just my imagination.

648
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,322
Sit down.

649
00:54:51,622 --> 00:54:53,284
I'm sorry I woke you up.

650
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,494
I just...

651
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,414
I don't think he's going
to come back again.

652
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:03,631
I just don't want to be alone right now.

653
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,923
Do you mind if I stay here a while?

654
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,511
If you'd like to go back upstairs,
I'd come...

655
00:55:12,601 --> 00:55:14,684
I'd really rather not go upstairs.

656
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:38,040
Why don't you lie down here? Sleep here.

657
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,956
- Come on.
- Where are you going to sleep?

658
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,207
I'll pull that out.

659
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:51,428
Lie down.

660
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,052
Thank you.

661
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,016
Good night.

662
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:44,891
Good night.

663
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,118
Hi.

664
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,250
What's the matter?

665
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,369
You were terrific.

666
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,714
A real tiger.

667
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,806
Are you upset because you didn't
make me come?

668
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,809
I never come with a john.

669
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:57,236
Don't feel bad about losing your virtue.
I sort of knew you would.

670
00:58:58,410 --> 00:58:59,992
Everybody always does.

671
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,505
Arlyn Page? Yeah, she was with me
about three months.

672
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,803
She was lucky I kept her that long.

673
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,255
She was out of it.

674
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:25,143
Somebody said she was streetwalking
over on Lexington Avenue.

675
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,723
Or was it 8th?

676
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,513
You might take a look.

677
00:59:29,441 --> 00:59:31,979
Or try Bill Azure, if you can find him.

678
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,480
Yeah, she used to dress the way you do.

679
00:59:39,618 --> 00:59:41,860
The whore? Yeah. I threw her out.

680
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,696
Do you know where she went from here?

681
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,621
Live like animals, her and the man.

682
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:50,211
Out.

683
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,961
She was living with a man?

684
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,588
He was worse than the whore.

685
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,160
Cappy?

686
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:31,542
- Arlyn Page?
- Arlyn, it's Bree.

687
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:32,869
Cappy, is that you?

688
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,296
It's all right.

689
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,872
Cappy, we got a radio...

690
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,382
Arlyn, it's okay.

691
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:46,640
Bree, honey, I'm waiting for someone.

692
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,259
You've gotta help us.
We've gotta ask you some questions.

693
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:54,603
Can't you see I'm strung out?

694
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,442
It'll only take a couple of minutes.
Ask her.

695
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,316
A couple of years ago
with Frankie and Jane,

696
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:02,649
- Jane sent me a guy that beat up on me.
- If he sees you, he won't come.

697
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,110
Was she seeing a freak,
one of her regular johns?

698
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:06,364
Was he a freak?

699
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,742
Yeah. What about it?

700
01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:10,915
Did he come around a lot?

701
01:01:21,052 --> 01:01:22,839
No, he was an older guy. Guy was older.

702
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:24,545
It's very important.

703
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,427
- Arlyn, get them out of here!
- I'm begging you.

704
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:30,851
It's very important, please.
Can you give me a description of him?

705
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,348
Cappy.

706
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,648
Cappy, listen. Don't...
Listen to me. Cappy!

707
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:38,272
Cappy, don't run, Cappy.
Cappy, don't run!

708
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,353
I've got a radio. Cappy!

709
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:42,206

724
01:06:04,127 --> 01:06:07,291
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow,
a narcotics addict.

725
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:10,043
Well, I believed her.
I believed her absolutely.

726
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:12,841
The man who did those beatings
was not Tom Gruneman.

727
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,169
Suppose it wasn't Tom.
Where does that get you?

728
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:18,176
Tom is still connected to the case
because of the letters,

729
01:06:18,266 --> 01:06:19,723
whether he wrote them or not.

730
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:22,385
I think the only way I'm going to find him

731
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:24,436
is to find the man
who did do the beatings.

732
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:27,606
The only way I'm going to find him
is to pursue Arlyn Page

733
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:31,652
and try and secure from her
some kind of identification.

734
01:06:33,198 --> 01:06:35,235
I'll be flying back to Pennsylvania
on Friday,

735
01:06:35,325 --> 01:06:36,941
and I'll fill them in on things.

736
01:06:37,285 --> 01:06:38,526
How is it back there?

737
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,913
I think you're homesick.
I'll be back on Thursday.

738
01:06:44,459 --> 01:06:47,793
John, I want to tell you
how much I respect your dedication.

739
01:06:48,213 --> 01:06:49,213
Thank you.

740
01:07:07,774 --> 01:07:11,393
<i>'Cause I'm very bad.
I have very wicked ideas.</i>

741
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,486
<i>I'm sure that as you're sitting
at your great desk,</i>

742
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,564
<i>you have all kinds of strange things
going through your mind.</i>

743
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,025
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that.</i>

744
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,110
<i>Nothing is wrong.</i>

745
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:24,496
<i>Do you mind if I take my sweater off?</i>

746
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:28,788
<i>I like to sort of walk around here
with no clothes on.</i>

747
01:07:29,379 --> 01:07:31,871
<i>Better. I think people wear clothes
much too often.</i>

748
01:07:31,965 --> 01:07:34,708
<i>I think in the confines of one's house,
one should be</i>

749
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:38,340
<i>free of clothing and inhibition.</i>

750
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:43,015
<i>I think the only way that any of us
can ever be happy</i>

751
01:07:43,101 --> 01:07:45,718
<i>is to let it all hang out.</i>

752
01:07:45,812 --> 01:07:48,395
<i>Do it all and fuck it.</i>

753
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:37,855
I was trying to get away from...

754
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:41,314
a world that I had...

755
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,697
that I had known because
I don't think it was very good for me...

756
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:48,780
and I found myself...

757
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:54,365
looking up its ass...

758
01:10:58,045 --> 01:11:02,836
and seeing people that I used to know
and that I...

759
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:09,341
that I liked a lot...

760
01:11:15,480 --> 01:11:16,812
that were my friends...

761
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,778
sort of...

762
01:11:23,738 --> 01:11:24,899
girls...

763
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:27,613
and...

764
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:37,290
that could've been me.

765
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:45,003
I mean, I know I'm not stupid.

766
01:11:49,722 --> 01:11:52,009
Ah, well, I guess I just realized that...

767
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:01,022
that I don't really give a damn.

768
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:10,441
<i>What I would really like to do
is be faceless and bodiless...</i>

769
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,538
<i>and be left alone.</i>

770
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:21,330
You're lucky they're still here.

771
01:12:22,088 --> 01:12:26,423
We don't keep unclaimed possessions
in suicide cases more than a year.

772
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,930
Number 497.

773
01:12:37,770 --> 01:12:38,770
Ah.

774
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,309
- Yeah.
- Jane McKenna.

775
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,115
I thought there'd be more.

776
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:58,928
<i>Well, there's this man that I...
this detective...</i>

777
01:14:00,102 --> 01:14:03,345
<i>and I don't know exactly what is...</i>

778
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:08,691
<i>happening or what he wants out of me
or anything like that,</i>

779
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:11,486
<i>but he took care of me.</i>

780
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:14,406
<i>Did you feel threatened by it?</i>

781
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,869
<i>When you're used to being lonely,
and you...</i>

782
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:23,415
<i>somebody comes in and moves that around,
it's sort of scary, I guess.</i>

783
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,711
<i>How do you feel when you feel scary?</i>

784
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:40,890
<i>Angry.</i>

785
01:14:40,977 --> 01:14:42,639
<i>At whom?</i>

786
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:44,845
<i>Whoever it is
that's making me feel that way.</i>

787
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:46,680
<i>Do you feel angry at him?</i>

788
01:14:48,818 --> 01:14:49,979
<i>A lot of the time.</i>

789
01:14:50,069 --> 01:14:52,469
<i>How do you feel angry?
What do you want to do?</i>

790
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,397
<i>I want to...</i>

791
01:15:05,084 --> 01:15:06,200
<i>manipulate him.</i>

792
01:15:07,003 --> 01:15:08,084
<i>How?</i>

793
01:15:10,923 --> 01:15:13,711
<i>In all the ways
that I can manipulate people.</i>

794
01:15:13,801 --> 01:15:16,293
<i>I mean, it's easy to manipulate men.
Right?</i>

795
01:15:45,416 --> 01:15:48,204
They were bringing a freighter
down through Kill Van Kull,

796
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:49,910
propellers washed it up on top.

797
01:15:53,799 --> 01:15:55,836
"Arlyn Page" was probably an alias.

798
01:16:14,236 --> 01:16:15,898
- I'm sorry...
- Hey, man, can you...

799
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:17,521
can you help me out?

800
01:16:19,784 --> 01:16:21,400
Yeah. Yeah. What?

801
01:16:24,163 --> 01:16:26,029
I mean, can you help me out?

802
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:35,213
I mean, it's... that's my baby, dead.

803
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:40,552
And I got to get up.

804
01:16:46,727 --> 01:16:49,390
I mean, you don't know what it means,
my baby, dead.

805
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,812
- Got to get up.
- Yeah.

806
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:56,653
Okay.

807
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,488
Yeah.

808
01:17:17,675 --> 01:17:19,382
Lieutenant Trask, please.

809
01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:21,046
John Klute.

810
01:17:23,806 --> 01:17:27,470
I think we should run down a check
on everybody who knew Tom Gruneman.

811
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,927
I don't think the man
who wrote the letters was Tom.

812
01:17:30,521 --> 01:17:32,729
Just run down a check on everything,
I guess.

813
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,266
I'll talk to you.

814
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,916
You're up, eh?

815
01:18:03,554 --> 01:18:04,635
How are you?

816
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,340
Trask wants you to call him.

817
01:18:11,937 --> 01:18:13,269
He told me about Arlyn.

818
01:18:25,034 --> 01:18:27,777
It probably doesn't have anything to do
with anything...

819
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:31,704
but just as a precaution...

820
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:35,579
when you go out,
if you'd tell me where you're gonna go,

821
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,499
a phone number where I can find you.

822
01:18:38,923 --> 01:18:41,210
Just so I can always keep in touch
with you.

823
01:18:42,301 --> 01:18:43,301
Okay?

824
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:45,803
Sure.

825
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:55,730
I'm all right.

826
01:18:56,357 --> 01:18:57,357
Yeah, I know.

827
01:19:00,694 --> 01:19:03,027
I feel physically,
that's what's different.

828
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:05,526
I mean, I feel... my body feels...

829
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:10,827
I enjoy... making love with him...

830
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:19,624
which is a very baffling
and bewildering thing for me,

831
01:19:19,713 --> 01:19:21,153
because I've never felt that before.

832
01:19:23,050 --> 01:19:26,293
I just wish that I could let things happen

833
01:19:27,012 --> 01:19:31,177
and enjoy it, you know,
for what it is and while it lasts

834
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:34,183
and relax about it.

835
01:19:36,021 --> 01:19:37,887
But all the time, all the time,

836
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:40,474
I keep feeling the need to destroy it,

837
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:43,526
to break it off,

838
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:50,776
to go back to the comfort
of being numb again.

839
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,453
I keep hoping, in a way,
that it's gonna end,

840
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:02,838
because I had more control before
when I was with tricks.

841
01:20:02,923 --> 01:20:06,883
At least I knew what I was doing,
and I was setting everything up. Now I...

842
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:12,676
And that's what's so strange,
is that I'm not setting anything up.

843
01:20:13,058 --> 01:20:17,018
That something is, I mean...

844
01:20:17,104 --> 01:20:20,188
You obviously know what this is like,
but I've never felt it before.

845
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,482
It's a new thing, and it's so strange,

846
01:20:23,277 --> 01:20:25,519
the sensation that something

847
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:30,149
that is flowing from me naturally
to somebody else...

848
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:35,077
without its being prettied up or...

849
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:37,281
I mean, he's seen me horrible!

850
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:40,249
He's seen me ugly,

851
01:20:40,336 --> 01:20:44,080
he's seen me... mean,

852
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:45,880
he's seen me whorey...

853
01:20:46,925 --> 01:20:48,587
and it doesn't seem to matter...

854
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,461
and he seems to accept me...

855
01:20:55,434 --> 01:20:59,348
And I guess having sex with somebody

856
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:03,682
and feeling those sort of feelings
towards them is very new to me,

857
01:21:03,776 --> 01:21:05,563
and I...

858
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:10,030
and I wish that I didn't keep wanting
to destroy it.

859
01:21:15,412 --> 01:21:16,869
I'm trying to stay out of it.

860
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,541
Yeah.

861
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,209
You know what?

862
01:21:28,509 --> 01:21:30,466
I'd love to party with you, but I...

863
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:32,214
Yeah.

864
01:21:33,013 --> 01:21:36,882
Well, listen, Martha,
why don't you try to get somebody else,

865
01:21:36,975 --> 01:21:39,308
and if I change my mind,
I'll call you, okay?

866
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:42,855
Good-bye.

867
01:22:05,838 --> 01:22:08,171
You're not going to get hung up on me,
are you?

868
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:12,968
- Yes, sir, can I help you?
- Can I have a bag, please?

869
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:15,386
- A couple of bags, please.
- All right.

870
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,098
All right.

871
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:20,596
Well, yeah, let me see
how much those weigh.

872
01:22:21,687 --> 01:22:24,430
Okay, let me have some of those
small tomatoes.

873
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:26,315
No mushy ones.

874
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,141
Yeah, okay, thanks.

875
01:22:35,242 --> 01:22:37,359
- What you got in your bag?
- What?

876
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,944
What have you got in your bag?

877
01:23:11,653 --> 01:23:14,361
- Can I have a cantaloupe, please?
- Cantaloupe?

878
01:23:15,949 --> 01:23:17,861
- How much for it?
- Dollar-50.

879
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,051
Wait.

880
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,238
He cut up my clo...

881
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,116
Oh, my God.

882
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,499
Oh, my God.

883
01:25:10,314 --> 01:25:11,314
Hello.

884
01:25:11,982 --> 01:25:15,396
<i>I can be a very bad girl.
I sometimes need a spanking.</i>

885
01:25:18,155 --> 01:25:20,613
<i>I have very wicked ideas.</i>

886
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,861
<i>I will do anything you ask.</i>

887
01:25:22,951 --> 01:25:25,364
<i>You should never be ashamed
of things like that.</i>

888
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:27,862
<i>There's nothing wrong.</i>

889
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:31,495
<i>I think the only way that any of us
can ever be happy</i>

890
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:35,204
<i>is to let it all hang out.</i>

891
01:25:35,297 --> 01:25:37,835
<i>Do it all and fuck it.</i>

892
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:41,417
<i>The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.</i>

893
01:25:46,183 --> 01:25:47,390
She can't remember.

894
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,388
It could've been on a...

895
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:54,018
It could've been hidden in his pocket.
I've seen one of those.

896
01:25:58,779 --> 01:26:00,486
All right, I'll wait for you here.

897
01:26:19,216 --> 01:26:20,216
Bree.

898
01:26:23,261 --> 01:26:26,675
Trask and some officers are going to come
and examine your apartment.

899
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:32,724
I want you to stay here
today and tomorrow.

900
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:36,101
You'll be safe here.

901
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,850
I'll only be gone
for a few minutes tomorrow.

902
01:26:57,546 --> 01:26:58,546
Bree.

903
01:27:05,262 --> 01:27:06,262
Bree?

904
01:27:11,268 --> 01:27:13,079
<i>You look like
you've been with many women,</i>

905
01:27:13,103 --> 01:27:15,937
<i>but I didn't know if you'd ever paid
for a woman before.</i>

906
01:27:16,648 --> 01:27:17,855
<i>You wouldn't need to.</i>

907
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:21,434
<i>So if you do, it's because it...
obviously because it excites you.</i>

908
01:27:21,528 --> 01:27:23,888
<i>Because you're not a man
that would have to pay for a woman.</i>

909
01:27:23,947 --> 01:27:25,779
<i>You could have any woman you wanted.</i>

910
01:27:26,992 --> 01:27:30,531
<i>The only responsibility you have to me
is to enjoy yourself.</i>

911
01:27:32,622 --> 01:27:37,083
<i>You know that I will do anything you ask
or you want</i>

912
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:40,537
<i>since you know that there are no limits
to my imagination,</i>

913
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,714
<i>and I place no moral judgments
on anything.</i>

914
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:55,643
We checked out 42 letters
of Tom Gruneman's friends.

915
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:59,814
And we only came up with one
with any similarity to the obscene letter.

916
01:28:00,901 --> 01:28:02,517
All right, there's Tom Gruneman.

917
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:06,987
Different margins, different spacings.

918
01:28:09,910 --> 01:28:13,324
That's mine.

919
01:28:13,789 --> 01:28:15,781
You said, "Check out everybody."

920
01:28:17,667 --> 01:28:19,954
Same margins, top and sides,

921
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:22,537
but he does best with his middle fingers.

922
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:26,583
We get fainter registrations
from outside keys.

923
01:28:27,052 --> 01:28:30,216
Notice how invariably he does that
with the T and the H.

924
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:47,315
Who is it?

925
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,193
Peter Cable.

926
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:59,786
But you have no case.
There's not even a body.

927
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:05,295
I'm sorry we have to meet here, John,
but I'm rushed for time.

928
01:29:05,382 --> 01:29:07,874
I have an important business meeting
tonight in Chicago.

929
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:09,049
Any developments?

930
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,924
I think I can close the case.

931
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:16,299
I think I can close the case

932
01:29:16,393 --> 01:29:20,478
if I can have $500 to purchase
Jane McKenna's address book.

933
01:29:22,816 --> 01:29:24,478
I don't understand. What do you mean?

934
01:29:24,568 --> 01:29:27,060
I've found a contact
who will sell me the book.

935
01:29:27,153 --> 01:29:31,113
A little black book containing the name
of the client that beat up Bree Daniels.

936
01:29:32,659 --> 01:29:35,993
He's also the man who came
into Bree Daniels' apartment yesterday

937
01:29:36,079 --> 01:29:37,079
and wrecked it.

938
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:42,367
We know that now because of the semen
that he left in her underwear.

939
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:47,125
The blood type is AB and Tom's was type A,
so it wasn't Tom.

940
01:29:52,387 --> 01:29:55,380
I think this man killed Jane McKenna
and killed Arlyn Page.

941
01:29:55,473 --> 01:29:56,680
I think he drowned them.

942
01:29:58,476 --> 01:30:02,186
I think you should prepare yourself
for the fact that possibly Tom is dead.

943
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:06,725
The only way I'll find out is to find him,

944
01:30:06,818 --> 01:30:08,650
and I need the money
before tomorrow night.

945
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:10,694
- You're meeting him tomorrow night?
- Yes.

946
01:30:10,780 --> 01:30:12,580
He'll come to my apartment
and bring the book.

947
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:13,616
At what time?

948
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,532
About 8:30.

949
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:20,325
All right, fine. I'll notify the board
as soon as I get to Chicago

950
01:30:20,415 --> 01:30:22,907
and have them wire you the money
immediately.

951
01:30:24,961 --> 01:30:29,080
Thank you, John.
I certainly hope you're wrong about Tom.

952
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,798
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

953
01:31:57,762 --> 01:31:59,253
I don't want you to do this.

954
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,640
Bree.

955
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:05,802
I'm just going
to a girlfriend's apartment.

956
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,896
I can't stay here, obviously.

957
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:17,904
Please.

958
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,318
Not with him.

959
01:32:22,996 --> 01:32:25,739
This other girl's
got a very big apartment,

960
01:32:25,832 --> 01:32:26,832
lots of room.

961
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,913
It's not necessarily how it looks.

962
01:32:31,921 --> 01:32:35,540
Look, we all respect each other, right?

963
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:37,966
I respect you.

964
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:41,379
Bree respects you.

965
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,174
But you gotta respect her too.

966
01:32:46,895 --> 01:32:48,056
Her best interests.

967
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,994
Mrs. Daniels, I have to close up now.

968
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,808
Leave your name and number
with the service.

969
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:41,799
I'm sure she'll get back to you
as soon as she has a chance.

970
01:34:41,885 --> 01:34:42,885
I can't.

971
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:45,802
Well, I have to close up now.

972
01:34:50,226 --> 01:34:51,637
I almost killed somebody.

973
01:34:52,353 --> 01:34:55,346
I'm certain the doctor
would like to speak with you about it.

974
01:34:55,440 --> 01:34:58,558
I'll have her call you
as soon as she gets home, I promise.

975
01:35:01,821 --> 01:35:03,153
Can I use your phone?

976
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:04,781
Sure.

977
01:35:10,747 --> 01:35:13,740
Is Mr. Goldfarb there?
Mr. Goldfarb Senior.

978
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:19,912
I've got to talk to somebody.

979
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:22,631
I'm just a little way across town.
Can I come over?

980
01:35:22,717 --> 01:35:25,926
About half an hour?

981
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:29,050
Uh-huh.

982
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:37,391
Detective Trask, please.

983
01:35:40,068 --> 01:35:41,104
Hi. John Klute.

984
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:44,395
He didn't take the plane, he canceled out.

985
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:47,606
I'm at home in my apartment.

986
01:35:48,326 --> 01:35:50,443
I don't know where she is.
She's left. I'll find her.

987
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:54,447
<i>Okay. Well, I'll leave word if I go out.</i>

988
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:55,576
<i>Okay.</i>

989
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,891
I have an appointment with Mr. Goldfarb.

990
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:25,856
Mr. Goldfarb!

991
01:36:27,323 --> 01:36:29,155
Mr. Goldfarb!

992
01:36:32,745 --> 01:36:34,486
Hello. What can I do for you?

993
01:36:35,999 --> 01:36:38,241
I'm sorry. I mean Mr. Goldfarb Senior.

994
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:41,452
My father left about 15 minutes ago.
He didn't feel so good.

995
01:36:41,921 --> 01:36:45,335
- Can I help you?
- He's working himself to death, poor man.

996
01:36:45,758 --> 01:36:48,171
- You sure I can't help you?
- It's not important.

997
01:36:48,261 --> 01:36:49,843
No, really, I don't mind.

998
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:52,763
You're gonna miss your train,
Mr. Goldfarb.

999
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:55,052
Excuse me.

1000
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:58,219
Did he leave a message for me,
Bree Daniels?

1001
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:01,980
Oh! I thought that was for tomorrow.

1002
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:17,071
Mr. Goldfarb's wire.

1003
01:37:19,167 --> 01:37:22,035
Oh, yes, Mama, I'm coming right now.

1004
01:37:22,128 --> 01:37:25,246
I know you don't like to get in
in the middle of the picture.

1005
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,752
Yes, right away. Bye-bye.

1006
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:35,923
We're closing now, miss.

1007
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:38,592
May I leave Mr. Goldfarb a message?

1008
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:41,269
Poor man, everybody's friend.

1009
01:39:10,236 --> 01:39:11,272
Hello?

1010
01:39:12,613 --> 01:39:13,613
Hello?

1011
01:39:15,032 --> 01:39:18,321
This is Bree Daniels.
Has the doctor checked in yet?

1012
01:39:18,744 --> 01:39:23,364
When she does,
would you tell her I'm at 246-1383?

1013
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:25,791
And I'll wait here about five minutes.

1014
01:40:56,801 --> 01:40:59,112
Can you tell me how I can
get in touch with the doctor?

1015
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:00,877
<i>Doctor hasn't checked in yet.</i>

1016
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:03,089
I'm trying to locate a Miss Bree Daniels.

1017
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:06,391
<i>Bree? I'm sorry, sir,
but we only take messages for the doctor.</i>

1018
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:10,812
Has she called in or anything?
Has she called the doctor at all today?

1019
01:41:10,898 --> 01:41:13,185
<i>I believe Miss Daniels did leave
a forwarding number.</i>

1020
01:41:13,276 --> 01:41:16,189
- Can you give me that number?
<i>- We can't give out that information.</i>

1021
01:41:16,279 --> 01:41:18,987
I'm a police officer.
Don't make me prove this. It's important.

1022
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:22,657
<i>Sorry. You must understand my position.
I must comply with the rules.</i>

1023
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:26,612
Yeah, I understand all that.
Will you just give me the number, please?

1024
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:38,123
Can we talk about this reasonably?

1025
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:43,128
I know you're expecting
some kind of extravagant behavior, but...

1026
01:41:45,641 --> 01:41:46,677
Do you believe me?

1027
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:48,476
Yes.

1028
01:41:49,562 --> 01:41:50,562
We can talk?

1029
01:41:57,320 --> 01:41:59,903
Well, it's just an ordinary matter.

1030
01:42:01,991 --> 01:42:03,357
I'm a very well-off man.

1031
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:06,569
I have a position to respect.

1032
01:42:08,247 --> 01:42:11,081
And I would feel, personally,
very uncomfortable

1033
01:42:11,167 --> 01:42:16,504
to be... connected
with a certain kind of woman.

1034
01:42:16,589 --> 01:42:18,421
I'm sure you understand what I mean.

1035
01:42:23,429 --> 01:42:25,466
Look, John Klute works for me.

1036
01:42:28,309 --> 01:42:30,016
I know you're his contact.

1037
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:36,394
And I know he's trying to acquire
Jane McKenna's book.

1038
01:42:40,279 --> 01:42:44,114
I'm in a position to offer more for it
than he can.

1039
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:53,240
You don't understand
what I'm talking about, do you?

1040
01:42:54,043 --> 01:42:57,207
Yes, Jane McKenna's book.
And I'll try to get it for you.

1041
01:42:57,672 --> 01:43:01,882
No. Obviously you're frightened
and you're lying.

1042
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:06,845
No, I'm not.
I will. I'll try to get it for you.

1043
01:43:08,891 --> 01:43:13,226
Is this something Klute's invented?

1044
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,476
Is this a trap for me?

1045
01:43:17,525 --> 01:43:19,187
Klute knows about me, doesn't he?

1046
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,359
Knows what about you?

1047
01:43:24,490 --> 01:43:26,197
Then everybody knows about me.

1048
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,944
So it doesn't make any difference
what I do anymore, does it?

1049
01:44:06,031 --> 01:44:08,148
I have no idea what I'm going to do.

1050
01:44:10,953 --> 01:44:12,740
And I'm so deeply puzzled.

1051
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:18,455
I've done terrible things.
I've killed three people.

1052
01:44:21,297 --> 01:44:23,835
But yet I don't consider myself
a terrible man.

1053
01:44:25,593 --> 01:44:28,552
No more than others.

1054
01:44:30,181 --> 01:44:31,968
See, Tom Gruneman discovered me.

1055
01:44:32,057 --> 01:44:33,844
We were here on business together,

1056
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:38,053
and he found me and Jane McKenna
in my hotel room.

1057
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:46,191
She had become hysterical,
and she started screaming,

1058
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,647
and I guess I hit her.

1059
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:52,200
I don't actually recall,
it all happened so quickly.

1060
01:44:53,078 --> 01:44:57,948
Anyway, she fell and hit her head,
and that's when Tom came in the room.

1061
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:00,785
I guess he must've heard her screaming.

1062
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:06,373
But I never understood really
why she did that.

1063
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:08,459
She had never screamed before.

1064
01:45:12,389 --> 01:45:15,302
And it was the revulsion

1065
01:45:15,392 --> 01:45:18,976
and the contempt that I saw on his face...

1066
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,060
and the certainty that sooner or later

1067
01:45:23,150 --> 01:45:25,858
he would use it against me,
within the company.

1068
01:45:27,780 --> 01:45:33,868
And I tried to endure that
as long as I possibly could, you see?

1069
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:42,584
You just want me to keep on talking,
don't you?

1070
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:45,920
No, I don't. I do understand. I really do.

1071
01:45:46,674 --> 01:45:48,210
Well, that's what you all do.

1072
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,379
You make a man think that he's accepted.

1073
01:45:55,724 --> 01:45:57,841
It's all just a great big game to you.

1074
01:46:00,229 --> 01:46:03,688
And you're all obviously too lazy
and too warped

1075
01:46:03,774 --> 01:46:05,891
to do anything meaningful with your lives,

1076
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:10,104
so you prey upon the sexual fantasies
of others.

1077
01:46:13,033 --> 01:46:15,946
I'm sure it comes
as no great surprise to you when I say...

1078
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:20,698
that there are little corners
in everyone...

1079
01:46:22,126 --> 01:46:24,118
which were better off left alone.

1080
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:31,546
Little sicknesses, weaknesses,
which should never be exposed.

1081
01:46:34,054 --> 01:46:37,889
But that's your stock-in-trade, isn't it,
a man's weakness?

1082
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:44,395
And I was never really fully aware
of mine...

1083
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:47,140
until you brought them out.

1084
01:47:12,468 --> 01:47:14,255
<i>How far out of town are we?</i>

1085
01:47:16,180 --> 01:47:19,719
<i>About five miles
outside of New York.</i>

1086
01:47:19,808 --> 01:47:23,552
<i>Do you mind
if I turn the lights down?</i>

1087
01:47:23,646 --> 01:47:26,263
<i>No, it's up to you.
Turn the light out if you'd like.</i>

1088
01:47:29,985 --> 01:47:31,567
<i>My name is Peter Cable.</i>

1089
01:47:32,613 --> 01:47:35,105
<i>I work for the Tole American Corporation,</i>

1090
01:47:35,908 --> 01:47:39,117
<i>which is situated in Pennsylvania
and in New York.</i>

1091
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:42,696
<i>Obviously, I would not
be telling you these things</i>

1092
01:47:43,457 --> 01:47:46,074
<i>if my intentions weren't honorable.</i>

1093
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:51,413
<i>Oh. You look familiar to me.</i>

1094
01:47:51,799 --> 01:47:52,960
<i>In what way?</i>

1095
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:56,339
<i>I don't know.
Your face looks familiar to me.</i>

1096
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:00,763
<i>I guess I have a confession to make.</i>

1097
01:48:00,849 --> 01:48:04,138
<i>We did meet before. About two years ago.</i>

1098
01:48:05,229 --> 01:48:09,690
<i>And I often wondered whatever happened
to Arlyn Page, and here you are.</i>

1099
01:48:12,069 --> 01:48:13,310
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

1100
01:48:15,990 --> 01:48:20,280
<i>Listen, I've got to get out of here.
I mean, I can't...</i>

1101
01:48:20,744 --> 01:48:22,076
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1102
01:48:22,955 --> 01:48:25,100
- <i>I remember you.
- What do you remember?</i>

1103
01:48:25,124 --> 01:48:27,241
<i>You beat me up,
that's what you did!</i>

1104
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:33,789
<i>It's okay. Just freaked me out
for a minute, that's all.</i>

1105
01:48:34,967 --> 01:48:38,131
<i>I promise to drive you back afterwards.</i>

1106
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:42,009
<i>Okay. Why don't you just tell me
what you'd like,</i>

1107
01:48:42,099 --> 01:48:44,637
<i>and then after you tell me
what you'd like...</i>

1108
01:48:44,727 --> 01:48:47,094
<i>I'd like to spend
just some time with you.</i>

1109
01:48:47,187 --> 01:48:49,554
<i>I have been looking for you for two years.</i>

1110
01:48:50,024 --> 01:48:51,060
<i>Why?</i>

1111
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:55,560
<i>That's my business.</i>

1112
01:48:58,782 --> 01:49:01,616
<i>I will say that you gave me
a great deal of pleasure.</i>

1113
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:07,118
<i>I saw in you things that I had not seen
in other women of your profession.</i>

1114
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,413
<i>I will not harm you at all physically.</i>

1115
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,711
- <i>It's all right.
- No, it's not all right.</i>

1116
01:49:13,797 --> 01:49:15,413
<i>Of course you know it's not all right.</i>

1117
01:49:15,507 --> 01:49:19,091
<i>No, it is all right.
But you have to tell me first, and then...</i>

1118
01:49:20,262 --> 01:49:23,801
<i>And if that's what you want, that's fine.</i>

1119
01:49:23,891 --> 01:49:27,931
<i>Arlyn, why don't you lie down
on the bed and make yourself comfortable?</i>

1120
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,393
<i>I'll not strap you in or tie you down.
Just lie down on the bed, please.</i>

1121
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,736
<i>Be comfortable. Nothing's going to happen.</i>

1122
01:49:45,412 --> 01:49:46,903
<i>Nothing's going to happen.</i>

1123
01:49:49,875 --> 01:49:51,036
<i>Okay.</i>

1124
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:55,997
<i>Why don't you make yourself comfortable?
Why don't you take your clo...</i>

1125
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:57,922
<i>I am perfectly comfortable.</i>

1126
01:49:58,342 --> 01:49:59,549
<i>Just put your head down.</i>

1127
01:50:02,554 --> 01:50:05,888
<i>You have such lovely long blonde hair.</i>

1128
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:09,676
- <i>Hmm.
- Turn your head.</i>

1129
01:50:11,772 --> 01:50:12,772
<i>Like that.</i>

1130
01:50:14,108 --> 01:50:17,601
<i>No! No!</i>

1131
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:36,544
<i>Oh.</i>

1132
01:51:44,489 --> 01:51:46,856
<i>I've explained to him what I have to do,</i>

1133
01:51:46,950 --> 01:51:49,693
<i>and I think he understands.</i>

1134
01:51:50,412 --> 01:51:53,621
<i>What could ever happen for us?
We're so different...</i>

1135
01:51:54,374 --> 01:51:58,038
<i>I know enough about myself to know that
whatever lies in store for me,</i>

1136
01:51:58,128 --> 01:52:02,793
<i>it's notgonna be setting up housekeeping
with somebody in Tuscarora,</i>

1137
01:52:02,883 --> 01:52:04,590
<i>and darning socks and doing all that.</i>

1138
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:07,168
<i>I mean, that's just...
I'd go out ofmy mind.</i>

1139
01:52:21,068 --> 01:52:24,687
<i>I don't know how I feel about him. I...</i>

1140
01:52:26,031 --> 01:52:29,399
<i>- It's so hard for me to say it! God!
- To say what?</i>

1141
01:52:29,493 --> 01:52:31,029
<i>I'm going to miss him.</i>

1142
01:52:46,718 --> 01:52:47,925
Bree Daniels.

1143
01:52:53,183 --> 01:52:54,344
How is Roy?

1144
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:05,484
Well, I'm leaving town right now,
and I don't expect to be back.

1145
01:53:06,905 --> 01:53:08,191
You're very nice.

1146
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:11,525
Thank you. Good-bye.

1147
01:53:27,259 --> 01:53:29,216
<i>I have no idea what's going to happen.</i>

1148
01:53:29,845 --> 01:53:32,428
<i>I just... I can't stay in the city.</i>

1149
01:53:34,391 --> 01:53:35,552
<i>Maybe I'll come back.</i>

1150
01:53:37,686 --> 01:53:39,848
<i>You'll probably see me next week.</i>
