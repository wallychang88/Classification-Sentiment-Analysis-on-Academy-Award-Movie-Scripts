Somebody forgot
something in the bathroom.

00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,384
Lenny, you forgot to flush.

15
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,054

Don't you see?

16
00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:49,257
I need to use the restroom.

17
00:02:49,332 --> 00:02:52,130
- So flush it.
- I'm not a housekeeper, remember?

18
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:53,897

Wake Me When It's Over.

58
00:06:14,471 --> 00:06:15,961
- Hey, Wen.
- Hi, Matt.

59
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,668
- How's it going? Getting anywhere?
- Just trying to power through.

60
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:23,907
Oh, yeah. Just do what you can.
Don't kill yourself.

<i>after being abandoned

<i>Thank you for considering my proposal.</i>

<i>Sincerely yours, Wendy Savage.</i>

72
00:07:25,942 --> 00:07:27,603
Hello. Hello.

73
00:07:28,778 --> 00:07:32,305
<i>You have two new messages.</i>

74
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:35,417
<i>First message:</i>

75
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:38,477
<i>Ms. Savage, this is Donna
from Dr. Reichman's office.</i>

76
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:40,147
<i>I'm just calling to let you know...</i>

77
00:07:40,223 --> 00:07:43,590
<i>that your Pap smear results
came back today and it's normal.</i>

78
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:46,561
<i>Everything's fine,
so there's nothing to worry about.</i>

79
00:07:46,629 --> 00:07:49,097
<i>If you have any questions
regarding the test, give me--</i>

80
00:07:59,275 --> 00:08:01,266
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:07,078
- Is this a bad time? I saw your lights come on. 
- No. I'm just--

82
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,811
- You know--
- Oh, okay, then.

83
00:08:08,885 --> 00:08:13,788
- No. I don't want to disturb you if you're--
- No, do, if you can.

84
00:08:13,857 --> 00:08:15,882
Can you?

85
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,427
I got Marley.

86
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,565
- Let's move to the bed.
- No, I like it here. Let's do it on the floor.

87
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,765
- No, come on, Larry.
- I need you to feel how hard my cock is.

88
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,139
I don't want to! The floor is gross.

89
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:36,337
You used to like it on the floor.

90
00:08:36,412 --> 00:08:38,380
When you first moved in, remember?

91
00:08:38,448 --> 00:08:41,815
Yeah, well, not anymore.

92
00:08:41,885 --> 00:08:44,786
It's middle-aged and depressing.

93
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,923
It makes me want to cry.

94
00:08:49,292 --> 00:08:51,886
- Come here, sweetie.
- What's the matter?

95
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:54,794
Come here, good girl. There we go.

96
00:08:54,864 --> 00:08:58,300
- What?
- I've got things going on.

97
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:00,495
- What things?
- Just... things.

98
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,731
Larry, things. It's personal.

99
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:04,773
I thought this was personal.

100
00:09:04,841 --> 00:09:07,173
Oh, personal... medical.

101
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:10,041
Okay?

102
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:12,104
It's cervical.

103
00:09:17,353 --> 00:09:20,686
I had a Pap smear.
Something was irregular.

104
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:24,921
Then I had to have another Pap smear.
They just called with the results.

105
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:26,791
And?

106
00:09:26,863 --> 00:09:31,027
And it's-- You know,
it's not for sure yet, you know...

107
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:33,933
but they might have to go in
and take something out...

108
00:09:34,003 --> 00:09:37,996
and test it and make sure it's not,
you know.

109
00:09:39,576 --> 00:09:41,510
God forbid.

110
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:54,084
- I'm sorry, Wen.
- Mmm.

111
00:09:58,428 --> 00:10:00,658
Annie had that.

112
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,095
What?

113
00:10:06,169 --> 00:10:08,865
A cervical thing--
some kind of procedure.

114
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,374
I went with her to the appointment.

115
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:14,672
She said it was pretty painless.
A little sore afterwards--

116
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:18,271
I feel-- I don't need to be hearing
about your wife's cervix right now.

117
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:21,374
- I'm just trying to be comforting.
- Oh, well, it's not.

118
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:23,180
- Oh.
- It's upsetting.

119
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:25,379
Okay.

120
00:10:25,455 --> 00:10:27,446
- Sorry.
- God!

121
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:56,581
Come here.

122
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:02,283
Come on!

123
00:11:02,358 --> 00:11:04,451
See you.

124
00:11:36,225 --> 00:11:37,715
Hello.

125
00:11:37,794 --> 00:11:39,421
<i>Jon, it's me.</i>

126
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:42,430
Dad is writing on the walls
with his shit.

127
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:47,300
- He's what?
- <i>He's writing with his shit, Jon-- Words!<i>

128
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,168
<i>On the bathroom wall, and he's
leaving them there, for this guy...</i>

129
00:11:50,239 --> 00:11:52,332
Eduardo, to find, like messages.

130
00:11:52,408 --> 00:11:55,434
Wendy, what-what the fuck
are you talking about?

131
00:11:55,511 --> 00:11:58,412
- <i>I am talking about Dad.</i>
- Okay.

132
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:00,540
He is losing his mind, or something.

133
00:12:00,616 --> 00:12:02,777
I got a phone call--
there's something wrong with him.

134
00:12:02,852 --> 00:12:05,252
He's acting out with his shit.
It's all he has left.

135
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,414
And now he's using it
to piss this guy off.

136
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,857
- Uh, what guy?
- <i>Doris' caregiver guy.</i>

137
00:12:10,927 --> 00:12:13,521
Here, here. Listen.

138
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:14,927
<i>Aloha, Wendy.</i>

139
00:12:14,997 --> 00:12:17,488
<i>This is Nancy Lachman,
Doris Metzger's daug--</i>

140
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:22,361
<i>There's been some trouble
with your dad.</i>

141
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:25,669
<i>I know you haven't communicated
with your father for quite some time.</i>

142
00:12:25,742 --> 00:12:28,575
<i>He's not the same anymore.
He forgets things, and--</i>

143
00:12:28,644 --> 00:12:30,339
<i>I'm sorry to leave this
on the machine--</i>

144
00:12:30,413 --> 00:12:32,347
<i>but Eduardo found Lenny
this morning...</i>

145
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:35,213
- <i>handling his, uh, fecal matter.</i>
- Uh, Wendy--

146
00:12:35,284 --> 00:12:37,445
<i>We hired Eduardo to care for
our mother, not your father.</i>

147
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,511
- <i>Wendy!</i>
- What?

148
00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:40,886
Turn it off!

149
00:12:40,957 --> 00:12:43,551
- <i>What is your problem?</i>
- It's the middle of the night.

150
00:12:43,626 --> 00:12:46,117
I've got to teach in the morning,
and I'm on a deadline.

151
00:12:46,195 --> 00:12:49,358
<i>He is writing with his shit, Jon!
Our father!</i>

152
00:12:49,432 --> 00:12:51,457
Do not leave me alone with this!

153
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:53,968
I'm not leaving you alone.
I'm just hanging up.

154
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:58,166
- We'll talk tomorrow. Okay? 
- <i>We don't even know where the man lives anymore.</i>

155
00:12:58,241 --> 00:13:01,039
<i>You want to know where he lives?
Sun City.</i>

156
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:03,943
Have you ever heard of that?
In the middle of the desert somewhere.

157
00:13:04,013 --> 00:13:05,640
We're gonna have to
go out there and find him.

158
00:13:05,715 --> 00:13:07,706
We are not gonna have to
go out there and find him.

159
00:13:07,784 --> 00:13:10,309
Wendy, we are not
in a Sam Shepard play.

160
00:13:10,386 --> 00:13:12,650
We're gonna have to do something.
This is a crisis.

161
00:13:12,722 --> 00:13:15,282
Look, I don't think
this actually qualifies as a crisis.

162
00:13:15,358 --> 00:13:19,351
It's an alarm, okay?
But it's not a crisis, not yet.

163
00:13:19,428 --> 00:13:22,920
- You mean, it's like we're in Orange.
- <i>What?</i>

164
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,627
Yeah. Right, exactly.

165
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:28,397
But we're in Yellow, okay?

166
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,998
So we should just... be aware...

167
00:13:32,074 --> 00:13:34,542
<i>and be cautious.</i>

168
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,841
And when it hits Red,
then we're in trouble.

169
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:39,848
<i>Okay?</i>

170
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:47,515
Your color, right?
Ms. Metzger? Ravishing Red?

171
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,190
Uh, right?

172
00:13:57,433 --> 00:14:00,027
See? Good color, right?

173
00:14:01,938 --> 00:14:04,873
Sexy. Okay.

174
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:13,041
Oh, my goodness.

175
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,140
Ms. Metzger?

176
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,956
Andy, it's me, Jon.

177
00:14:26,028 --> 00:14:28,019
Good, good.

178
00:14:28,097 --> 00:14:32,227
I'm, uh, still plugging away
on that Brecht book.

179
00:14:32,301 --> 00:14:36,829
Yeah, well, he's a complex man.
And you?

180
00:14:36,906 --> 00:14:41,275
Oh, yeah, I heard
Stanford's playing footsie with you.

181
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:44,711
That's great. Oh, great.

182
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,578
Look, I need a favor.

183
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:51,609
Well, it's kind of last minute.
I'm out of town, actually.

184
00:14:51,687 --> 00:14:53,621
Arizona.

185
00:14:54,957 --> 00:14:57,551
Yeah, it's a family thing.

186
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:00,858
No, nothing serious. It's my father.

187
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,831
No, he's just, uh--
his girlfriend died.

188
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,963
Yeah. And, uh, he's getting pretty old
himself, I guess, like everybody.

189
00:15:09,038 --> 00:15:11,734
Yeah. Well, that's what
I was gonna ask you.

190
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,742
It's my 9:00 a.m. On Monday.

191
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,506
"Oedipal Rage and Beckett,"
of all things.

192
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,208
- I have to stop at baggage claim.
- Hold on. Hold on a second.

193
00:15:20,283 --> 00:15:23,582
- You checked luggage? We're only here for a day.
- Two days and one night.

194
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,644
Excuse me
if I plan on changing my clothes.

195
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:28,315
Sorry. Uh, it's my sister.

196
00:15:42,872 --> 00:15:46,535
- I gained some weight.
- I didn't say anything.

197
00:15:46,609 --> 00:15:49,043
Kasia didn't have you pack
a button-down?

198
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:51,477
- What is this, a goddamn fashion show?
- No.

199
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:54,539
It's just, when someone dies,
people dress up.

200
00:15:57,486 --> 00:16:00,011
She's moving back to Poland.

201
00:16:01,657 --> 00:16:04,091
- What, you and Kasia broke up?
- Her visa expired.

202
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:09,595
S-So that's it?
Her visa expires, so-so it's over?

203
00:16:09,665 --> 00:16:11,633
Well, it's either that
or we get married...

204
00:16:11,701 --> 00:16:14,033
and no one's ready for that, okay?

205
00:16:19,442 --> 00:16:22,377
You've been together for over three years.
You're 42 years old--

206
00:16:22,445 --> 00:16:25,744
Wendy, I really don't need romantic advice
from my little sister at the moment.

207
00:16:25,815 --> 00:16:28,841
Let's just take care of the situation
and stay out of each other's shit, okay?

208
00:16:28,918 --> 00:16:30,351
I'm just trying to talk about it.

209
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:33,582
Well, we're not in therapy right now.
We're in real life.

210
00:17:08,057 --> 00:17:11,891
Oh, here. I almost forgot.
Shoot. We have to sign this.

211
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:15,897
They didn't have a very big selection.
Is this okay?

212
00:17:15,965 --> 00:17:18,160
"These words, we hope,
may ease your loss."

213
00:17:18,234 --> 00:17:20,566
"Our prayers are with you,
our love, our thoughts."

214
00:17:20,636 --> 00:17:23,469
So this is sent with some--

215
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:25,507
Here.

216
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,382
Don't forget the balloon.

217
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,437
You must be Leonard's kids.

218
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,535
Uh-huh.

219
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:05,603
The hospital's just five minutes away.

220
00:18:05,681 --> 00:18:08,081
And don't worry. It's nothing serious.

221
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,311
He's been feeling kind of faint...

222
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,913
and what with
the toileting incident and all...

223
00:18:13,989 --> 00:18:16,856
the doctor thought a few tests
were in order.

224
00:18:16,926 --> 00:18:18,860
Well, I-I guess--

225
00:18:18,928 --> 00:18:22,091
I guess we should be going then.

226
00:18:26,268 --> 00:18:28,896
- We're really sorry about your mom.
- Oh, thank you.

227
00:18:28,971 --> 00:18:31,701
Uh, Jon, Wendy--

228
00:18:31,774 --> 00:18:33,833
One more thing before you go.

229
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:35,570
Please sit.

230
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,308
I just want to say...

231
00:18:45,287 --> 00:18:48,256
you know, we love Lenny.

232
00:18:49,992 --> 00:18:54,224
He's been like family to us, but...

233
00:18:54,296 --> 00:18:56,924
he's not really our family--
he's yours.

234
00:18:56,999 --> 00:18:59,229
So...

235
00:18:59,301 --> 00:19:01,769
I hope you'll be able to find
someplace nice for him.

236
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:06,274
- What do you mean?
- She means a place where he can live.

237
00:19:06,342 --> 00:19:08,833
- Right. He lives here.
- That's correct.

238
00:19:08,911 --> 00:19:12,847
Your father's been living off the charity
of our family for quite some time.

239
00:19:12,915 --> 00:19:15,247
- Bill--
- Why would you say charity, Bill?

240
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:18,445
Doris asked my father to come live
with her as a boyfriend, not a boarder.

241
00:19:18,521 --> 00:19:21,752
They were a couple.
They were together for over 20 years.

242
00:19:21,824 --> 00:19:24,452
You can't just throw the man
out on the street.

243
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:28,725
He has a right to live here. Legally speaking,
it's a common law marriage at this point.

244
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:30,765
Not exactly.

245
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:34,625
Not in front of the kids, Bill.

246
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:38,571
Let's step outside.

247
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:52,882
So, was Lenny there
when this was signed?

248
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:56,152
Notarized, all legal.

249
00:19:58,494 --> 00:20:01,463
It's called a non-marital agreement.
It's like a prenup without the nup.

250
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,157
It says that even though
they lived together...

251
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:06,463
they have no legal obligation to each
other, that everything's separate.

252
00:20:06,535 --> 00:20:10,699
And, basically, Dad has no legal right
to any of her property.

253
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,764
Bet you they've already
got the place listed.

254
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:15,435
Did you notice that there wasn't
one picture of us anywhere?

255
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:17,843
Are you surprised?

256
00:20:17,913 --> 00:20:20,381
It's like we don't even exist.

257
00:20:32,194 --> 00:20:33,855
<i>...on your toughest stains.</i>

258
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:36,124
<i>How about this coffee stain on my blouse?</i>

259
00:20:36,198 --> 00:20:38,325
<i>I'll add some things
and make it really messy.</i>

260
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,335
<i>Oxy Clean seeks out stains
and works right before your eyes.</i>

261
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:44,201
<i>Grass and dirt don't stand a chance
against new Oxy Clean.</i>

262
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:48,539
<i>It tackles grass, dirt and grease better
than ever. It gets the stains out.</i>

263
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:51,978
<i>It's safe on all your laundry,
because it's chlorine-free.</i>

264
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:53,275
<i>Wow!</i>

265
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:56,284
<i>Add a scoop to every load
and see for yourself.</i>

266
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,013
<i>It's tough on stains, safe on colors.</i>

267
00:20:58,087 --> 00:21:01,989
<i>And Oxy Clean still works great
on carpet and upholstery.</i>

268
00:21:02,057 --> 00:21:04,958
<i>Call now, and you'll receive
a whopping six pound--</i>

269
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:07,552
- Where the hell have you been?
- Hi, Dad.

270
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:09,860
- Hi, Dad. How are you?
- How are you?

271
00:21:09,932 --> 00:21:11,866
They had me hog-tied for two days.

272
00:21:11,934 --> 00:21:13,868
We got here as soon as we could.

273
00:21:13,936 --> 00:21:16,461
We came straight from the airport.
It-It's Jon and Wendy.

274
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:18,472
I know who you are.

275
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:20,838
The late ones. You're late.

276
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:24,367
You weren't here,
and this is what they do, see?

277
00:21:24,446 --> 00:21:26,175
- Dad--
- You weren't here, I said! Nobody!

278
00:21:26,248 --> 00:21:30,082
- Jon, go get somebody. - We weren't here
'cause we live on the East Coast.</i>

279
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:31,813
- Remember?
- Yeah?

280
00:21:31,887 --> 00:21:34,082
We haven't seen you in a long time.
We're here to help you.

281
00:21:34,156 --> 00:21:37,182
So do something!
You're the doctor!

282
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:41,162
I'm gonna go get somebody.

283
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:44,996
He's not that kind of doctor, Dad.
He-He's a professor.

284
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:48,596
I thought my boy was a doctor.

285
00:21:48,671 --> 00:21:50,662
Doctor of Philosophy.

286
00:21:52,107 --> 00:21:54,905
PhD. Teaches college.

287
00:21:54,977 --> 00:21:58,504
Medicine?

288
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,514
No.

289
00:22:00,582 --> 00:22:03,244
Drama.

290
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:06,948
- He teaches theater.
- Like Broadway?

291
00:22:07,022 --> 00:22:11,482
No, like... theater of social unrest.

292
00:22:12,561 --> 00:22:14,552
Stuff like that.

293
00:22:16,332 --> 00:22:18,323
He's doing a book on-on Bertolt Brecht.

294
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,459
I'll release him
only if he promises to be good.

295
00:22:20,536 --> 00:22:23,767
We can't have him get out of bed by himself.
Are you going to be good, Mr. Savage?

296
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,807
Are you going to be good, Dad?

297
00:22:25,874 --> 00:22:27,569
You're not good, they won't let you go.

298
00:22:27,643 --> 00:22:30,271
You can't keep pulling on everything.
This is for your own good.

299
00:22:30,346 --> 00:22:32,371
This is your food.

300
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:35,474
We don't want him
climbing out on his own.

301
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,816
- He's unsteady. He can fall.
- We'll keep an eye on him.

302
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,480
Thank you.

303
00:22:49,198 --> 00:22:51,792
<i>Vascular dementia or multi-infarct...</i>

304
00:22:51,867 --> 00:22:53,960
usually follow one or more strokes...

305
00:22:54,036 --> 00:22:57,164
but I am not seeing
any sign of a stroke here.

306
00:22:57,239 --> 00:22:59,833
But the disinhibition,
the aggression, masked facies...

307
00:22:59,908 --> 00:23:03,139
with a blank stare that we had talked about
earlier, are all fairly good indicators.

308
00:23:03,212 --> 00:23:07,012
- Is it like Alzheimer's? - There are 
a lot of illnesses that can cause dementia.

309
00:23:07,082 --> 00:23:09,812
I'm not prepared to make
a diagnosis yet, but I think...

310
00:23:09,885 --> 00:23:12,353
his symptoms are much more
characteristic of Parkinson's disease.

311
00:23:12,421 --> 00:23:14,787
So, w-what do we have
to look forward to?

312
00:23:14,857 --> 00:23:18,293
Well, he's not a young man, so cardiac
or respiratory failure may spare him...

313
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,693
from the worst of it, but, uh,
tremors when the limb is at rest...

314
00:23:21,764 --> 00:23:25,393
a shuffling walk, freezing up,
unable to initiate movement...

315
00:23:25,467 --> 00:23:27,435
more and more loss
of motor coordination in general.

Maybe Dad didn't abandon us.
Maybe he just forgot who we were.

329
00:24:12,214 --> 00:24:15,615
- I'm gonna give Brian Deener a call.
- Who's that?

330
00:24:15,684 --> 00:24:17,879
He's a friend of mine,
teaches in the English department.

331
00:24:17,953 --> 00:24:20,387
He just put his mother
in a nursing home near campus.

332
00:24:20,456 --> 00:24:22,447
Could we have some more nuts?

333
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:28,823
- Nursing home?
- Yeah. What?

334
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:32,094
- I wasn't thinking about putting him in a nursing home.
- What were you thinking?

335
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:36,365
- I don't know, but I wasn't thinking that.
- Where else is he gonna live?

336
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:39,100
I mean, really, what's the alternative?
You want to--

337
00:24:39,174 --> 00:24:42,803
- You want to change Dad's diapers, wipe his ass?
- He doesn't need diapers.

338
00:24:42,878 --> 00:24:45,108
- What do you think that catheter was?
- He's in the hospital.

340
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:49,448
But look, even if they did
let Dad stay here...

341
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:52,715
he'd still have to have somebody take care
of him. We can't afford that.

342
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:55,188
You heard the nurse.
Dad falls. He's disoriented.

343
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:57,418
He hasn't fallen once
since we've been here.

344
00:24:57,493 --> 00:25:01,156
Don't make me out to be the evil brother who's
putting away our father against your will.

345
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:03,528
All right,
we're doing this together, right?

348
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:10,298
Well, there's places.

349
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:11,930
- What places?
- Like Aunt Gertie.

350
00:25:12,007 --> 00:25:14,874
That's assisted living. I'm not sure
Dad would get into one of those.

351
00:25:14,943 --> 00:25:17,776
Gertie's pretty independent, remember?
She's also rich.

352
00:25:17,846 --> 00:25:21,145
Okay, so I'm gonna call United...

353
00:25:21,216 --> 00:25:23,650
and try to get the first flight out
first thing tomorrow...

354
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:26,552
get back and see if I can find
a place that'll take him.

355
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:29,090
What am I gonna do?

356
00:25:29,157 --> 00:25:31,625
You're gonna stay here and hold down
the fort until I find something.

357
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,251
By myself?

358
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:36,889
Wendy, this is not the time to regress.

359
00:25:54,783 --> 00:25:57,581
I just don't know
if it's something that I can do...</i>

360
00:25:57,653 --> 00:25:59,644
and so I just don't talk.

361
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:05,189
I don't know how long he'll be gone,
you don't know how long you'll be gone.

362
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,751
And that's just not something
I think I can deal with...

363
00:26:07,829 --> 00:26:10,263
by talking on the phone
every couple weeks.

364
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,161
We can talk more about this
when I get home.

365
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:22,673
Tomorrow morning.

366
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:26,407
I'll make sure to call when I get in.

367
00:26:26,481 --> 00:26:30,383
Okay. Bye.

368
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:43,759
Hey, Wendy? Wen?

369
00:26:46,935 --> 00:26:48,698
I'm going.

370
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:55,068
That should take care of the hotel.

371
00:26:55,143 --> 00:26:57,373
Thanks.

372
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:03,741
- Jon?
- Yeah?

373
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,878
You okay?

374
00:27:05,954 --> 00:27:09,446
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'll talk to you later.

375
00:27:09,524 --> 00:27:11,492
Okay.

<i>Tap that left for four.</i>

379
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:30,002
<i>Grapevine left.
Step touch four times!</i>

380
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:37,284
<i>Now to the Sunday Puzzle from NPRNews.</i>

381
00:27:39,121 --> 00:27:41,885
<i>And the chance to match wits with fellow

382
00:27:45,327 --> 00:27:47,761
- Here it is.
- Oh.

383
00:27:47,829 --> 00:27:51,856
Hello. <i>Hello?</i>

384
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:53,901
<i>Hello. Who is it?</i>

385
00:27:57,673 --> 00:28:01,131
- Hung up.
- <i>Book Expo was the big--</i>

386
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:10,312
<i>So, not only do you have a formal
dining room, if you like to entertain...</i>

387
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:12,945
but you also have an updated kitchen
with granite countertops...

388
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:15,854
oak cabinets,
brand-new appliances...

389
00:28:15,924 --> 00:28:17,949
and they all convey to the new owner.

390
00:28:18,026 --> 00:28:19,618
And look at this dramatic view...

391
00:28:19,695 --> 00:28:22,220
of the eighth tee
on the Lake West golf course.

392
00:28:22,297 --> 00:28:23,730
How perfect is this?

393
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:27,200
<i>You're also only
a five-minute stroll from--</i>

394

00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:38,239
<i>We have eight golf courses--</i>

397
00:29:26,962 --> 00:29:29,226
Sure. We could try maybe 30 days.

398
00:29:30,432 --> 00:29:32,400
No, they're already pre-approved...

399
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:34,867
so it's not gonna take any time at all.

400
00:29:34,936 --> 00:29:38,702
Okay, I'll see you about 3:00.

401
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:26,087
- Hello.
- Hi.

402
00:30:26,154 --> 00:30:30,784
Oh, my God, Jon. You are not--
You are not gonna believe this.

403
00:30:30,859 --> 00:30:32,793
<i>I-I just-- I found this stash...</i>

404
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:35,625
<i>of photographs and stuff
that Dad's kept all these years.</i>

405
00:30:35,697 --> 00:30:39,565
I can't believe it. I am looking at
the funniest picture of you right now.

406
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:41,568
- <i>Oh, yeah?</i>
- You have braces.

407
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:44,127
How come you got braces?
I never got braces.

408
00:30:44,206 --> 00:30:46,868
Ever looked at my teeth?
They're still crooked.

409
00:30:46,942 --> 00:30:49,137
<i>Oh, yeah. How come?</i>

410
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:51,839
'Cause Dad never paid the bills,
and the orthodontist was so pissed off...

411
00:30:51,913 --> 00:30:54,040
he pulled them out of my mouth
before my teeth were fixed.

412
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,948
So I think I found something.

413
00:30:58,019 --> 00:30:59,452
What?

414
00:30:59,521 --> 00:31:02,251
<i>It's a place with an opening
that can take him right away.</i>

415
00:31:02,324 --> 00:31:04,224
What kind of place?

416
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:06,556
A-A facility for older people.

417
00:31:06,628 --> 00:31:08,562
In this country,
they call 'em nursing homes.

418
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:11,258
I thought we were gonna try
assisted living.

419
00:31:11,333 --> 00:31:14,393
They're not gonna take him at assisted
living, Wendy. Let's just be real.

420
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:17,370
- He's got dementia.
- <i>Well, don't lead with that.</i>

421
00:31:17,439 --> 00:31:20,636
Look, if it's any consolation,
uh, this place...

422
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:22,836
they don't call it a-a nursing home.

423
00:31:22,911 --> 00:31:26,039
- Well, what do they call it?
- Uh, rehabilitation center.

424
00:31:26,114 --> 00:31:28,105
It's called the Valley View.

425
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:31,979
<i>That sounds nice.</i>

426
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:35,318
- Is it?
- <i>It's a nursing home, Wendy.</i>

427
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:38,018
- Does it smell?
- Yeah, it smells. They all smell.

428
00:31:38,093 --> 00:31:42,621
Look, this place has an empty bed, they
take Medicaid and it's close to my house.

429
00:31:42,697 --> 00:31:46,360
Believe me, once you get inside,
these places are all the same.

430
00:31:47,869 --> 00:31:51,270
- Hello? - <i>Make sure you have a coat 
for him when we get there.</i>

431
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:53,569
<i>He doesn't have any warm clothes.</i>

432
00:32:06,521 --> 00:32:09,854
- Hi, Dad.
- Hiya.

433
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:13,855
How ya feelin'?

434
00:32:13,929 --> 00:32:15,863
Not bad.

435
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:19,390
You don't need these, right?

436
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:22,526
Not your style.

437
00:32:23,538 --> 00:32:25,529
Look like Grandpa Walton.

438
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,780
Okay, just sign and initial at the Xs.

439
00:32:39,621 --> 00:32:41,521
And here are your valuables.

440
00:32:41,589 --> 00:32:45,525
New prescription. Medication.

441
00:32:46,594 --> 00:32:49,085
Thank you.

442
00:32:50,332 --> 00:32:51,924
And let me give you these.

443
00:32:55,804 --> 00:32:58,932
They don't really like us to give
these away, but you might need 'em.

444
00:33:00,909 --> 00:33:02,843
Thanks.

445
00:33:45,787 --> 00:33:48,119
Excuse me. Sorry.

446
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:50,123
I'm sorry.

447
00:33:50,191 --> 00:33:51,920
- Hi.
- Hi.

448
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,820
Okay, Dad.

449
00:33:59,434 --> 00:34:01,561
Thank you.

450
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:07,773
Excuse me. Sorry.

451
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:16,810
<i>Can we have your attention?</i>

Okay.

463
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:12,872
All right.

464

What-What is it, Dad?

465
00:35:38,967 --> 00:35:41,561
- What are these? - They're Dad's. 
I couldn't get 'em back on his feet.

466
00:35:41,636 --> 00:35:43,536
They swelled up. I need ten bucks.

467
00:35:43,605 --> 00:35:45,732
- Where is he?
- Inside.

468
00:35:45,807 --> 00:35:47,604
Thank you. Pop the trunk.

469
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,404
- Did you remember the coat?
- Yeah. I can't, uh, leave the car unattended.

470
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,675

You like Bingo, Mr. Savage?

482
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,464
Every Tuesday and Thursday night.

483
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,167
Don't like it.

484
00:37:28,743 --> 00:37:30,677

All right. Here we are.

487
00:37:38,353 --> 00:37:40,617
Have the bathroom and closet there.

488
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:43,680
You will share that with Mr. Sperry.

489
00:37:45,727 --> 00:37:48,127
These are just the bare essentials,
of course.

490
00:37:48,196 --> 00:37:51,723
But once you move in,
you can fix it up any way you like.

491

Hi.

00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,635
Hi.

494
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:11,709
All right. Well, I'll leave you alone to,
uh, look around and get yourselves together.

495
00:38:11,786 --> 00:38:14,755
Gonna need you to sign some papers.

496
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:17,723
- I'll send somebody in to get him ready for bed.
- Okay.

497
00:38:20,895 --> 00:38:23,261
Good evening, sir. I'm Jimmy.

498
00:38:23,331 --> 00:38:26,232
You ready for a good night's sleep? Hmm?

499
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:29,828
Give me arms up in the air. Up.

500
00:38:29,904 --> 00:38:31,667
Come on.

501
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,673

502
00:38:33,741 --> 00:38:37,268
Good man.
You ever done time, Mr. Savage?

503
00:38:48,189 --> 00:38:52,057
It's a good idea not to make too big of
a thing when you leave for the first time.

504
00:38:52,126 --> 00:38:53,855
Just go real casual.
No big good-byes.

505
00:38:53,928 --> 00:38:58,922
We don't wanna get him agitated before
he's had time to settle in to his new home.

506
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,934
- All right.
- Thank you.

507
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:02,993
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of him.

508
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:10,040
- Is everything okay, Dad?
- Not bad.

509
00:39:10,111 --> 00:39:12,102
All right then. See ya tomorrow.

510
00:39:16,284 --> 00:39:18,275
Good night, Dad.

511
00:39:21,656 --> 00:39:24,591
Hey.

512
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:28,117
Don't forget to tip the girl
on the way out.

513
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:31,631
All right.

514
00:39:59,727 --> 00:40:01,718
What's the matter?

515
00:40:04,565 --> 00:40:09,161
He didn't-- He didn't
even know where we were taking him.

516
00:40:16,411 --> 00:40:19,437
He still doesn't know.
He doesn't know where he is, Wendy.

517
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:28,018
We are horrible,
horrible, horrible people.

518
00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:30,114
We are horrible!

519
00:40:32,427 --> 00:40:34,418
Horrible!

520
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:37,860
Just horrible.

521
00:40:37,932 --> 00:40:39,900
Horrible.

522
00:41:15,336 --> 00:41:17,861
Looks like the Unabomber lives here.

523
00:41:17,939 --> 00:41:20,499
Yeah, well, I've been doing
a lot of research for the book.

524
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:22,941
The couch is actually pretty comfortable.

525
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,036
Great. Where is it?

526
00:41:34,522 --> 00:41:37,047
Those go over here... actually.

527
00:41:53,341 --> 00:41:55,741
It doesn't look like it, I know...

528
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,971
but there's actually
a system to all this.

529
00:41:58,045 --> 00:42:00,206
Okay.

530
00:42:20,401 --> 00:42:23,370
Jon? What's Zocor?

531
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:26,734
Is it for depression?

532
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:29,469
- It's for cholesterol.
- You have high cholesterol?

533
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:32,240
Yes!

534
00:42:44,659 --> 00:42:47,184
Is this all your nursing home research?

535
00:42:49,163 --> 00:42:51,154
Most of these aren't even open.

536
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:05,302
Hill Haven. This looks nice.

537
00:43:05,379 --> 00:43:08,507
It's in Vermont. I really wish
you hadn't brought that down.

538
00:43:22,229 --> 00:43:24,390
- Jon.
- What?

539
00:43:24,465 --> 00:43:28,231
- What is it?</i>
- Theatre of the Absurd.</i>

540
00:43:40,948 --> 00:43:44,008
You gonna stop?

541
00:43:44,085 --> 00:43:46,019
Yeah.

542
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:49,684
Sorry.

543
00:43:49,757 --> 00:43:51,725
Sorry.

544
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:03,031
We're doing the right thing, Wen.

545
00:44:03,104 --> 00:44:06,096
We're taking better care of the old man
than he ever did of us.

546
00:44:07,141 --> 00:44:09,575
I know.

547
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:11,635
Good night.

548
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:29,285
<i>We know this is one
of the toughest decisions of your life.</i>

549
00:44:30,698 --> 00:44:33,861
<i>What to do when the parent
who took care of you...</i>

550
00:44:33,934 --> 00:44:36,801
<i>can no longer take care of themselves?</i>

551
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,303
<i>That's why here, at Greenhill Manor...</i>

552
00:44:42,376 --> 00:44:45,868
<i>we are committed to providing
the highest quality of care...</i>

553
00:44:45,946 --> 00:44:48,141

00:44:48,215 --> 00:44:51,844
<i>Our board-certified physicians

555
00:44:51,919 --> 00:44:53,614

<i>and emotional well-being

557
00:44:57,491 --> 00:45:01,450
<i>Come celebrate 100 years
of award-winning care.</i>

558
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:14,965
<i>♪ Heaven ♪</i>

559
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:18,034
<i>♪ I'm in heaven ♪</i>

560
00:45:18,112 --> 00:45:21,047
<i>♪ And my heart beats so
that I can hardly speak ♪</i>

561
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:24,380
And exhale.

562
00:45:24,452 --> 00:45:26,886
<i>♪ And I seem to find
the happiness I seek ♪</i>

563
00:45:26,954 --> 00:45:29,218
And breathe it up.

564
00:45:29,290 --> 00:45:31,281
And breathe up wonderful, good energy.

565
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:33,451
Fill yourself with it.

566
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:35,552
And let go of everything you don't need.

567
00:45:35,629 --> 00:45:37,620
Ahh.

568
00:45:37,698 --> 00:45:41,327
Good. Reaching for the person
in front of you, stretch... forward.

569
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:43,495
<i>♪ I'm in heaven ♪</i>

570
00:45:46,774 --> 00:45:48,765
Well, his Medicaid
seems to be squared away.

571
00:45:48,843 --> 00:45:52,006
And as far...

572
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:54,070
as the advance directive--

573
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:58,143
Hey, I take that.

574
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:01,518
On your pen, for anxiety.

575
00:46:04,091 --> 00:46:06,423
Not all the time.
Just when I need it.

576
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,694
Here's the, uh, health care proxy
we talked about...

577
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:18,432
and the living will material.

578
00:46:18,506 --> 00:46:20,804
We'll need these signed
by both you and your father.

579
00:46:22,877 --> 00:46:25,903
The only thing missing here
is the paperwork regarding...

580
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,312
the funeral arrangements.

581
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:32,844
We'll need to know your father's
burial or cremation plans.

582
00:46:40,661 --> 00:46:43,391
See, if you switch
this little thing here...

583
00:46:43,464 --> 00:46:46,365
you can change the volume...

584
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,458
and turn it off.

585
00:46:48,536 --> 00:46:50,561
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:46:50,638 --> 00:46:52,799
There you go.

587
00:47:00,014 --> 00:47:02,574
H-He's got it. He's got it.

588
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,185
How's that?

589
00:47:06,253 --> 00:47:09,689
- Good level?
- Yeah. Yeah.

590
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:12,089
Dad, we need to talk
about a couple things.

591
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,289
- But we-we don't want you to
take it in the wrong way. - Okay.

592
00:47:16,363 --> 00:47:18,558
Yeah, it's just, uh--
it's a couple questions...

593
00:47:18,632 --> 00:47:21,032
that'll make everything easier
in the long run.

594
00:47:25,706 --> 00:47:27,867
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

595
00:47:27,942 --> 00:47:29,933
Okay.

596
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,941
In the event--

597
00:47:37,451 --> 00:47:40,579
In the event
that something should happen--

598
00:47:40,654 --> 00:47:43,214
Um--

599
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,281
Mm-hmm?

600
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:47,884
How--

601
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:51,454
- Dad--
- How do you want us to, um--

602
00:47:51,532 --> 00:47:53,796
Dad, what if you were in a coma?

603
00:47:53,868 --> 00:47:55,665
Jon.

604
00:47:55,736 --> 00:48:00,366
Would you-- Would you-- Would you want
a breathing machine to keep you alive?

605
00:48:01,575 --> 00:48:04,271
What kind of question' is that?

606
00:48:04,345 --> 00:48:09,305
It's a question we should know, in case.

607
00:48:09,383 --> 00:48:11,408
In case what?

608
00:48:11,485 --> 00:48:13,419
In case something happens.

609
00:48:13,487 --> 00:48:16,047
Nothing's gonna happen.
Right now. Nothing new.

610
00:48:16,123 --> 00:48:18,182
Right, it's-it's just procedure.

611
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:20,284
It's something they want
for their records.

612
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:22,124
- Who?
- The people who run the place.

613
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:23,925
The Valley View.
614
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:27,999
What the hell kind of hotel is it?

615
00:48:28,068 --> 00:48:30,935
Dad, it's not a hotel,
it's a nursing home.

616
00:48:46,287 --> 00:48:48,448
Unplug me.

617
00:48:48,522 --> 00:48:51,389
What?

618
00:48:51,458 --> 00:48:53,949
Pull the plug!

619
00:49:01,502 --> 00:49:06,132
Okay, Dad. So now,
um, once we unplug you--

620
00:49:06,206 --> 00:49:08,970
- I'm dead.
- Right.

621
00:49:09,043 --> 00:49:11,671
- And then, we--
- What?

622
00:49:14,081 --> 00:49:16,015
What do we do with you?

623
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:19,252
Bury me!

624
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:22,949
What are you, a bunch of idiots?
You bury me!

625
00:49:24,024 --> 00:49:26,356
Christ.

626
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:38,404
- Oh, Jesus!
- Sorry to scare you.

627
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,874
You just gave your sister heart attack.

628
00:49:41,942 --> 00:49:44,342
She didn't expect to find Polish woman
in her brother's home.

629
00:49:44,411 --> 00:49:45,537
- I told you.
- No, you didn't.

630
00:49:45,612 --> 00:49:46,738
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

631
00:49:46,814 --> 00:49:49,180
- Yes, I did.
- No, you didn't.

632
00:49:49,249 --> 00:49:53,083
I'm taking Kas to the airport 
in the morning. Early flight, right?

633
00:49:53,153 --> 00:49:55,246
We have to leave at 6:30 at latest.

634
00:49:55,322 --> 00:49:57,313
Okay.

635
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:03,957
It's back to Kraków for Kasia.

636
00:50:04,031 --> 00:50:06,693
Yeah, Jon told me. I'm sorry.

637
00:50:06,767 --> 00:50:09,031
Your brother won't marry me...

638
00:50:09,103 --> 00:50:13,369
but when I cook him eggs, he cries.

639
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,273
I should take cab to airport
like self-respecting feminist woman...

640
00:50:16,343 --> 00:50:18,277
but here I am.

641
00:50:19,213 --> 00:50:22,080
See you in morning.

642
00:51:21,842 --> 00:51:25,778
- How'd it go at the airport?
- It was fine.

643
00:51:25,846 --> 00:51:27,814
Good.

644
00:51:27,881 --> 00:51:31,510
- Was it emotional?
- No, not really.

645
00:51:31,585 --> 00:51:34,019
She loves you.

646
00:51:34,088 --> 00:51:36,556
Yeah, well, there are
practical considerations...

647
00:51:36,623 --> 00:51:38,352
that love has nothing to do with.

648
00:51:38,425 --> 00:51:40,086
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

649
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:42,628
Like what?

650
00:51:42,696 --> 00:51:45,597
Do you have any idea how many
Comp Lit critical theory PhDs there are...

651
00:51:45,666 --> 00:51:47,793
running around this country
looking for work?

652
00:51:47,868 --> 00:51:50,029
Even if Kasia and I did get married
and she stayed...

653
00:51:50,104 --> 00:51:52,129
she could end up teaching
at some university...

654
00:51:52,206 --> 00:51:54,265
that's farther away from here
than Poland.

655
00:51:54,341 --> 00:51:57,435
And then we wouldn't be together either.
See what I'm saying?

656
00:51:58,479 --> 00:52:00,208
You're an idiot.

657
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,976
Can we just play the game?

658
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,982
- I got us an interview.
- For what?

659
00:52:09,056 --> 00:52:11,991
For a really nice alternative
to the Valley View.

660
00:52:12,059 --> 00:52:15,426
- But we just got him in there.
- Just hold your judgments until you see it.

661
00:52:15,496 --> 00:52:17,657
It's very beautiful.

662
00:52:17,731 --> 00:52:19,722
It's called Green Hill Manor.

663
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,598
Sounds like an insane asylum.

664
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:26,195
Aah! Oh!

665
00:52:26,273 --> 00:52:28,605
Are you okay?

666
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:32,611
- No, I'm not okay.
- Are you having a heart attack?

667
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,772
No, I'm not having a heart attack!

668
00:52:34,848 --> 00:52:36,509
Wendy, fuck!

669
00:52:39,786 --> 00:52:43,244
- How much do I fill it up?
- 18 pounds.

670
00:52:52,099 --> 00:52:54,067
What do I do with it?

671
00:52:54,134 --> 00:52:56,500
Just hook it to this.

672
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,142
Okay, further down.

673
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:09,614
- What, am I gonna pull it? - No,
that's it, that's it, that's it-- Good.

674
00:53:16,256 --> 00:53:18,816
Ow, ow.

675
00:53:18,892 --> 00:53:21,656
What, it's not funny.

676
00:53:21,728 --> 00:53:24,629
It's not.

677
00:53:24,698 --> 00:53:26,859
- Really, it's not.
- What--

678
00:53:26,934 --> 00:53:29,027
It's not funny.

679
00:53:29,102 --> 00:53:31,900
- What's it supposed to do?
- It relieves the pressure.

680
00:53:31,972 --> 00:53:34,736
I'm supposed to stay like this
for 30 minutes.

681
00:53:34,808 --> 00:53:37,208
- Oh.
- And--

682
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,905
All right, Wendy. Go get my mail.

683
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:41,914
Just go get my mail.

684
00:53:52,993 --> 00:53:56,326
Stop staring.

685
00:53:56,396 --> 00:53:59,661
This is for you.

686
00:53:59,733 --> 00:54:01,928
Larry Mendlessohn.
Who's Larry Mendlessohn?

687
00:54:02,002 --> 00:54:04,095
A friend of mine,
forwarding me my mail.

688
00:54:04,171 --> 00:54:07,868
Is it the married guy?

689
00:54:07,941 --> 00:54:09,932
I'm starving.
Want something to eat?

690
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,069
I thought you were going to stop
seeing that creep.

691
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:14,773
- How about tuna melts?
- Whatever.

692
00:54:44,978 --> 00:54:47,310
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

693
00:55:01,828 --> 00:55:04,388
Look, I need you to spend
Thanksgiving with Dad.

694
00:55:05,565 --> 00:55:07,556
We're not doing it together?

695
00:55:07,634 --> 00:55:11,001
It's the only time I can get away
for research.

696
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:14,871
- Well, I have things to do, too.
- Like what?

697
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:18,775
Like my life, for instance,
in New York City.

698
00:55:18,845 --> 00:55:20,836
Maybe it's time to stop
being so self-involved...

699
00:55:20,914 --> 00:55:23,849
and think about someone else's life
for a change.

700
00:55:23,917 --> 00:55:27,080
Yeah, like you, who can't put his
book aside for a minute while Dad dies.

701
00:55:27,154 --> 00:55:31,022
I've got to get this thing finished, Wendy.
My editor thinks it's a good time for it.

702
00:55:31,091 --> 00:55:33,889
Everyone's really itching for a book
about Bertolt Brecht this holiday season.

703
00:55:33,960 --> 00:55:35,689
Wendy, I'm working.

704
00:55:35,762 --> 00:55:37,753
I'm working.

705
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,231
I know you are.

706
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:42,598
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

707
00:55:42,669 --> 00:55:44,694
It's just--

708
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:47,433
It's just I got a lot riding on this book.

709
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:52,137
And-And your life's
much more portable than mine.

710
00:55:52,212 --> 00:55:55,113
What is that supposed to mean?

711
00:55:55,182 --> 00:55:58,743
What, like-like a toilet?
What, like a porta-potty?

712
00:55:58,819 --> 00:56:03,381
No, it's just, you know,
you don't have a job job, I do.

713
00:56:03,457 --> 00:56:05,084
I have obligations.

714
00:56:05,158 --> 00:56:08,594
You're-You're freelance.

715
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:12,098
Couldn't you just hook up
with a temp agency around here?

716
00:56:14,034 --> 00:56:16,025
Actually, Jon...

717
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:22,102
I'm being funded right now,
to work on my plays.

718
00:56:22,175 --> 00:56:25,838
And that-that might seem
a little self-involved to you...

719
00:56:25,912 --> 00:56:29,211
but I also have obligations
to a prestigious foundation...

720
00:56:29,282 --> 00:56:32,740
that has put a lot of faith in me...

721
00:56:32,819 --> 00:56:37,256
and, frankly, has given me a hell
of a lot more support than he ever has.

722
00:56:37,324 --> 00:56:40,191
You got it?

723
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:41,852
What?

724
00:56:41,928 --> 00:56:44,419
The Guggenheim?

725
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:47,433
Yeah.

726
00:56:48,802 --> 00:56:51,236
Really?

727
00:56:51,304 --> 00:56:54,535
Yeah, really.

728
00:56:54,608 --> 00:56:57,941
- Why do you sound so surprised?
- I-I'm not. I'm just--

729
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:03,244
It's just a really hard 
thing to get is all.

730
00:57:03,316 --> 00:57:06,444
I-I applied for it a half dozen times.
I never got one.

731
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,545
Well, I did.

732
00:57:08,622 --> 00:57:11,216
Why is that so hard for you to believe?

733
00:57:11,291 --> 00:57:14,590
No, I-I believe it. I just can't believe
you've been keeping it a secret.

734
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:16,856
- I just found out.
- Just now?

735
00:57:21,568 --> 00:57:25,868
Oh, my God. It's... amazing.

736
00:57:25,939 --> 00:57:27,998
That's really great, Wen.

737
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:31,202
I, uh-- I'm really proud of you.

738
00:57:31,278 --> 00:57:32,905
You are?

739
00:57:32,979 --> 00:57:35,743
Yeah, it's amazing. It's major.

740
00:57:35,816 --> 00:57:37,750
It's, um--

741
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:45,348
I mean, maybe this is your--
your time, you know. Your year.

742
00:57:49,296 --> 00:57:53,426
Look, how about we both work here
and ride out the holidays together...

743
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,630
and get lots of writing done,
and, you know, we-- It'll be fun.

744
00:57:57,704 --> 00:58:00,195
We'll inspire each other.

745
00:58:00,273 --> 00:58:04,232
Uh, our own little writers' colony.

746
00:58:08,281 --> 00:58:10,613
I'm really proud of you, Wen.

747
00:58:39,913 --> 00:58:41,904
You stole painkillers from a dead woman?

748
00:58:44,684 --> 00:58:47,278
- Mmm.
- Do they work?

749
00:58:47,354 --> 00:58:49,288
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

750
00:59:03,837 --> 00:59:05,737
<i>Salud.</i>

751
00:59:12,078 --> 00:59:13,909

- You're in my apartment?
- I'm on your bed with Marley.

765
01:00:10,837 --> 01:00:12,998
She's got one of your T-shirts.

766
01:00:13,073 --> 01:00:16,668
Mm-mm!

767
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:19,337
<i>It smells like you,
like, uh, lavender and sweat.</i>

768
01:00:20,814 --> 01:00:23,180
Genghis is here, too.
I'm totally getting a hard-on.

769
01:00:23,249 --> 01:00:26,275
- Will you please--
- <i>Sorry.</i>

770
01:00:26,353 --> 01:00:28,583
- How's Genghis?
- She's good. You want to hear her?

771
01:00:28,655 --> 01:00:31,453
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Come here, honey. Here you go.

772
01:00:31,524 --> 01:00:33,458
<i>Hello, bunny.</i>

773
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:35,221
<i>Oh, beast.</i>

774
01:00:35,295 --> 01:00:37,855
She misses you.

775
01:00:37,931 --> 01:00:40,695
You giving her her medication?

776
01:00:40,767 --> 01:00:42,257
<i>Yeah.</i>

777
01:00:42,335 --> 01:00:44,428
Did you water my plant?

778
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:47,603
Yeah, it's doing good.

779
01:00:47,674 --> 01:00:51,235
- When are you coming back?
- After the holidays.

780
01:00:51,311 --> 01:00:54,610
- Thank you for sending me my mail.
- <i>Oh, no problem.<i>

781
01:00:54,681 --> 01:00:55,978
- Uh, Wen?
- <i>Yeah?</i>

782
01:00:56,049 --> 01:00:58,108
I'm gonna be leaving town
next week for a week.

783
01:00:58,184 --> 01:01:01,881
- I-I won't be able to take care of Genghis. 
- Where are you going?

784
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:04,947
Uh, Toronto, to visit Annie's family.

785
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:08,451
<i>It's her parents' 50th anniversary.</i>

786
01:01:10,997 --> 01:01:13,465
<i>Wendy?</i>

787
01:01:13,533 --> 01:01:15,125
Wendy?

788
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:17,032
Did you lose your hard-on?

789
01:01:17,103 --> 01:01:21,472
Wendy, come on.
How about I drive up and bring Genghis?

790
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:25,375
<i>We could spend the afternoon 
together. It'll be fun.</i>

791
01:01:25,445 --> 01:01:27,640
<i>I know it's not much of an offer, but...</i>

792
01:01:27,714 --> 01:01:29,875
you know my situation.

793
01:01:33,186 --> 01:01:35,814
Okay, now if we could all take a look...

794
01:01:35,889 --> 01:01:39,052
at the second page of the blue handout...

795
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:41,650
you'll see a section called
"Creating Special Moments. "

796
01:01:41,728 --> 01:01:45,220
If you're ever at a loss for what to do
with your elder on visiting days...

797
01:01:45,298 --> 01:01:47,823
this list can come in very handy.

798
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:51,564
Hello? Are you here
for the support group?

799
01:01:54,174 --> 01:01:56,506
You have a family member with dementia?

800
01:01:58,978 --> 01:02:01,276
Okay, well, you're in the right place.

801
01:02:01,347 --> 01:02:04,475
Just grab a couple packets and welcome.

802
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,484
And there's room up front.
We won't hurt you.

803
01:02:09,556 --> 01:02:12,320
You've probably been hurt enough already.

804
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:18,357
We're talking about activities you can share
with your confused elder on visiting day.

805
01:02:18,431 --> 01:02:21,264
I culled that list from a terrific book.

806
01:02:24,003 --> 01:02:28,440
You laugh, but I love this series.

807
01:02:28,508 --> 01:02:31,534
When my mother was diagnosed
with Parkinson's, this was my bible.

808
01:02:31,611 --> 01:02:35,172
Here we go. "Number one:
Ask your elder about the old days."

809
01:02:35,248 --> 01:02:37,375
Okay, now I know that sounds
pretty obvious...

810
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:41,477
but when you're dealing with dementia,
you have to work extra hard at this.

811
01:02:41,554 --> 01:02:44,045
You can't just sit on the side of the bed,
asking questions.

812
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:46,285
Bring things in
to stimulate their memory.

813
01:02:46,359 --> 01:02:50,295
Old movies are a terrific so--
Excuse me!

814
01:02:51,965 --> 01:02:54,729
Uh, we-we haven't served
the refreshments yet.

815
01:03:01,708 --> 01:03:05,200
Uh, photographs, that seems obvious.

816
01:03:05,278 --> 01:03:07,212
Uh, movies from the--

817
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,909
from their era, again,
can also be very powerful.

818
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,661
Oh.

819
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,467
Is that your neighborhood, Dad?

820
01:03:36,543 --> 01:03:38,636
Yep.

821
01:03:38,711 --> 01:03:42,010
They got that right.

822
01:03:47,687 --> 01:03:49,985
There she is.

823
01:03:51,157 --> 01:03:53,318
- Who?
- You see her?

824
01:03:53,393 --> 01:03:56,089
She's cooking my dinner for me.

825
01:03:58,097 --> 01:04:01,032
- That bastard.
- That's the father, Dad.

826
01:04:04,771 --> 01:04:08,400
- Hey, you son of a bitch!
- Shut up. Will you shut up?

827
01:04:08,474 --> 01:04:10,635
You shut yourself up!
It's my night!

828
01:04:12,111 --> 01:04:15,478
- He'd always smack me around
- Dad, it's okay. Sit down.

829
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:17,072
You're in the way of the program.
Sit down.

830
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:20,210
- Go to hell, you goddamn old vegetable.
- You're an animal.

831
01:04:20,286 --> 01:04:25,053
- Drop dead! - Sit down. Dad, it's okay. 
It's okay. Just sit down.

832
01:05:01,561 --> 01:05:03,791
This is supposed to remind him
of the olden days.

833
01:05:11,905 --> 01:05:13,896
Look behind you.

834
01:05:18,811 --> 01:05:22,838
- Why are they still showing this?
- This is their entertainment.

835
01:05:32,392 --> 01:05:34,121
You can't judge it by today's standards.

836
01:05:34,193 --> 01:05:36,252
You have to look at it
in a historical context.

837
01:05:36,329 --> 01:05:39,127
I just thought Dad would like
an old movie. Bye. Thanks.

838
01:05:39,198 --> 01:05:41,462
Thank you so much. Thanks.

839
01:05:41,534 --> 01:05:44,230
Thank God we have that interview tomorrow.

840
01:05:46,873 --> 01:05:49,706
Let's just take the stairs.

841
01:05:49,776 --> 01:05:52,267
Thank you. Thanks.

842
01:05:55,281 --> 01:05:57,442
They're gonna ask you
a bunch of questions...

843
01:05:57,517 --> 01:05:59,678
and you're really gonna
have to concentrate, Dad.

844
01:05:59,752 --> 01:06:02,050
- It's important.
- Okay.

845
01:06:23,443 --> 01:06:28,005
- What's that?
- Gingko biloba-- boosts brain function.

846
01:06:28,081 --> 01:06:30,015
Want some?

847
01:06:31,784 --> 01:06:34,014
Dad, open your mouth.

848
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:40,282
Mm.

849
01:06:46,632 --> 01:06:48,759
It's like a pharmacy in there.

850
01:06:49,769 --> 01:06:51,703
What are those?

851
01:06:51,771 --> 01:06:54,604
Antidepressants. You should try some.

852
01:06:54,674 --> 01:06:57,074
- I'm not depressed.
- Please.

853
01:06:57,143 --> 01:06:59,543
You must be the Savages.

854
01:06:59,612 --> 01:07:01,978
- Hi. Jon.
- Roz. How do you do?

855
01:07:02,048 --> 01:07:03,709
- Wendy. Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

856
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:07,116
- Our father.
- Nice to meet you. I'm Roz Landis.

857
01:07:07,186 --> 01:07:12,920
My name is
Leonard Michael Joseph Savage.

858
01:07:14,761 --> 01:07:18,128
Okay. Lenny, can you tell me
what season we're in?

859
01:07:21,834 --> 01:07:24,826
Cold.

860
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,140
And the season is?

861
01:07:31,077 --> 01:07:33,204
Winter. What do you think?

862
01:07:34,647 --> 01:07:37,810
And what is the date today?

863
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:42,349
November.

864
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:44,356
I don't remember the day.

865
01:07:44,424 --> 01:07:46,585
Okay.

866
01:07:46,659 --> 01:07:48,923
Can you tell me where we are?

867
01:07:48,995 --> 01:07:51,555
What city we're in?

868
01:08:00,907 --> 01:08:04,070
Put down "East Coast. "

869
01:08:14,887 --> 01:08:16,684
Boston.

870
01:08:16,756 --> 01:08:19,247
- Boston, Mass.
- You can't help him, Ms. Savage.

871
01:08:19,325 --> 01:08:22,453
- He has to be able to answer the
questions himself. - He knows where he is.

872
01:08:22,528 --> 01:08:23,961
- Wendy.
- What?

873
01:08:24,030 --> 01:08:25,964
- She's conducting a test.
- I know. I'm not an idiot.

874
01:08:26,032 --> 01:08:29,126
Let her ask the goddamn questions!

875
01:08:40,379 --> 01:08:42,506
What'd you say to them?

876
01:08:42,582 --> 01:08:46,109
I said he was pretty good except
he goes in and out every once in a while.

877
01:08:46,185 --> 01:08:48,449
"In and out"?
Wendy, the man's got dementia.

878
01:08:48,521 --> 01:08:51,979
I-I know, but they only had beds
for people who are more independent.

879
01:08:52,058 --> 01:08:54,549
I thought if we could
just get him in there--

880
01:08:54,627 --> 01:08:56,356
Why are you wasting our time
on fantasies?

881
01:08:56,429 --> 01:09:00,593
She said she would put him
on one of the waiting lists.

882
01:09:02,068 --> 01:09:05,196
I mean, J-Jesus,
I-I'm just doing it for Dad.

883
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:07,705
Dad's not the one that has
a problem with the Valley View.

884
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,003
I'm just trying to improve the situation.
Is that a crime?

885
01:09:10,076 --> 01:09:12,977
There's nothing wrong with Dad's
situation. Dad's situation is fine.

886
01:09:13,045 --> 01:09:15,411
He's never gonna adjust to it
if we keep yanking him out.

887
01:09:15,481 --> 01:09:18,075
And actually, this upward mobility
fixation of yours--

888
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:20,847
it's counterproductive
and, frankly, pretty selfish.

889
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,219
- Selfish? - Because it's not about Dad, 
it's about you and your guilt.

890
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,451
That's what these places prey upon.

891
01:09:26,526 --> 01:09:28,357
I happen to think it's nicer here.

892
01:09:28,427 --> 01:09:31,624
Of course you do, because you are
the consumer they want to target.

893
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:34,393
You are the guilty demographic. The
landscaping, the neighborhoods of care--

894
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,401
They're not for the residents,
they're for the relatives...

895
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:39,097
people like you and me who don't want
to admit to what's really going on here.

896
01:09:39,172 --> 01:09:42,107
- Which is what, Jon?
- People are dying, Wendy!

897
01:09:42,175 --> 01:09:46,475
Right inside that beautiful building
right now, it's a fucking horror show!

898
01:09:46,546 --> 01:09:50,312
A-And all this wellness propaganda
and the landscaping--

899
01:09:50,383 --> 01:09:54,183
It's just there to obscure
the miserable fact that people die!

900
01:09:54,253 --> 01:09:56,448
And death is gaseous and gruesome...

901
01:09:56,522 --> 01:10:01,152
and it's filled with shit
and piss and rotten stink!

902
01:10:01,227 --> 01:10:03,627
Come on, Nana.

903
01:11:06,592 --> 01:11:09,459
There. What do you think?

904
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:12,764
What's it do?

905
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:18,833
- Nothing. It's just something 
nice to look at. - Oh.

906
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:21,964
- Hey, how you doing, Mr. Savage?
- Hi, Jimmy.

907
01:11:24,644 --> 01:11:26,475
That's not Jimmy, Dad.

908
01:11:26,545 --> 01:11:29,105
What the hell are you talking about?

909
01:11:29,181 --> 01:11:31,376
- I'm sorry. He's-He gets a little--
- It's okay.

910
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,351
It's Howard, Mr. Savage.
I'm here to put you to bed.

911
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:37,184
Thursday is Jimmy's night off.

912
01:11:37,256 --> 01:11:39,986
Well, then...

913
01:11:40,059 --> 01:11:43,187
I better get going, so, 
good night, Dad.

914
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,730
Good night.

915
01:11:55,308 --> 01:11:57,299
Good night, Mr. Sperry.

916
01:12:17,830 --> 01:12:21,391
- Leave it on.
- Are you sure?

917
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:24,265
- Won't keep you up?
- Yes, I'm sure.

918
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:30,338
Here you go. Good night, Mr. Savage.

919
01:12:30,409 --> 01:12:32,400
Good night.

- Hi.
- Hi.

927
01:13:26,599 --> 01:13:30,126
Hi, baby. Hello. Where's the beast?

928
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:34,468
- Here.

929
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:36,474
Hello!

930
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:40,103
- Did you remember her papers?
- Yeah.

931
01:13:40,179 --> 01:13:42,170
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

932
01:13:42,248 --> 01:13:44,910
- How's Marley?
- She, you know-- She's hanging in there.

933
01:13:44,984 --> 01:13:47,145
Her hind legs are really bothering her...

934
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:51,155
but I found this great vet over at the 
animal hospital-- That place on the East Side.

935
01:13:51,223 --> 01:13:53,418
They have her in physical therapy.
Do you believe it?

936
01:13:53,492 --> 01:13:56,188
She's hanging out twice a week
in the whirlpool.

937
01:13:56,262 --> 01:13:58,196
Get in. Come on. We'll take a ride.

938
01:13:58,264 --> 01:14:00,357
I've never been to Buffalo.

939
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:04,062
Let's have some fun! I've missed you!

940
01:14:07,306 --> 01:14:09,035
Jon?

941
01:14:09,108 --> 01:14:10,700
Jon!

942
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:15,972
- What?
- I'm gonna go out for a minute.

943
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:19,711
- Okay.
- Um, this is my friend Larry.

944
01:14:20,886 --> 01:14:22,877
- This is Jon.
- Hi, Jon.

945
01:14:22,955 --> 01:14:26,584
- Hi, Larry.
- Wendy's told me a lot about you.

946
01:14:27,893 --> 01:14:30,259
I loved your essay
on Mother Courage, by the way.

947
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:34,425
Wendy showed it to me. I did
a production of it. It was a huge help.

948
01:14:38,404 --> 01:14:40,338
Okay.

949
01:14:41,740 --> 01:14:45,506
- He seems really nice.
- Yeah.

950
01:14:46,979 --> 01:14:48,970

01:15:51,544 --> 01:15:53,478
I don't know.

968
01:15:56,181 --> 01:15:58,843
You killed my plant.

969
01:15:58,918 --> 01:16:02,046
- No, I didn't.
- Well, it's not thriving.

970
01:16:02,121 --> 01:16:06,080
- It was thriving when I left.
- I'm sorry.

971
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,491
It's not the plant.
The plant is symbolic.

972
01:16:09,562 --> 01:16:12,531
- Of what?
- What do you think?

973
01:16:12,598 --> 01:16:16,329
- I know this isn't perfect.
- It's not perfect? I mean, come on, Larry.

974
01:16:16,402 --> 01:16:19,200
I mean, for Christ's sake,
I have an MFA.

975
01:16:19,271 --> 01:16:21,569
I mean, look at this.

976
01:16:21,640 --> 01:16:24,768
We're in a motel room in Buffalo.

977
01:16:24,843 --> 01:16:27,710
- I mean, it's embarrassing. It's a cliché!
- Shh.

978
01:16:27,780 --> 01:16:30,874
- What cliché?
- The midlife crisis cliché.

979
01:16:30,950 --> 01:16:34,078
- Whose?
- Yours!

980
01:16:34,153 --> 01:16:36,144
You are married. You are cheating.

981
01:16:36,221 --> 01:16:38,781
You are sleeping with a younger woman.

982
01:16:38,857 --> 01:16:40,791
Uh, Wendy--

983
01:16:40,859 --> 01:16:43,293
You're-You're not exactly
a younger woman.

984
01:16:43,362 --> 01:16:45,557
- What's that supposed to mean?
- You're 39.

985
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:47,326
- You're 52.
- So?

986
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:49,333
- That makes you older.
- Yeah, technically.

987
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:51,699
But this is not exactly the paradigm...

988
01:16:51,770 --> 01:16:55,331
of a prototypical winter-spring romance.

989
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:59,468
Annie's 46.
I mean, you're not my little student.

990
01:16:59,545 --> 01:17:03,481
It's not like we got
<i>The Blue Angel</i> going on here.

991
01:17:03,549 --> 01:17:06,677
- You know, the professor character in <i>The Blue Angel?</i>
- Yeah, Larry, I know the film.

992
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:09,277
Well, yeah, so the poor slob
has an affair with his student...

993
01:17:09,355 --> 01:17:11,289
and his life is destroyed by it.

994
01:17:11,357 --> 01:17:13,382
- Von Stroheim.
- Von Sternberg.

995
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:15,393
- Whatever.
- Von Sternberg.

996
01:17:15,461 --> 01:17:18,055
- You know what I mean. Marlene Dietrich.
- It's--

997
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:21,531
She was a nightclub singer.
She was not a student.

998
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:27,997
But there-there is-- There's a
Francine Prose novel by the same name...

999
01:17:29,241 --> 01:17:31,232
about a professor-student relationship.

1000
01:17:31,310 --> 01:17:34,040
- Why do you do this?
- What?

1001
01:17:34,113 --> 01:17:37,981
You do this all the time, and on top of that,
you insult me by telling me that I'm the one...

1002
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:41,247
that's having a midlife crisis here, when you're
the one having an affair with a married guy...

1003
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,686
instead of seeking real intimacy...

1004
01:17:43,756 --> 01:17:45,781
with someone who is available
for real commitment.

1005
01:17:45,858 --> 01:17:47,883
And you know, it's all about your father.

1006
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,190
Oh, hey!

1007
01:17:50,262 --> 01:17:52,753
Hey.

1008
01:17:52,831 --> 01:17:56,562
I'm just trying to have
a healthy, normal sex life here.

1009
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:58,967
I-- Look, I'm not betraying anyone.

1010
01:17:59,038 --> 01:18:00,972
Only yourself.

1011
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:03,372
- What?
- Nothing.

1012
01:18:05,177 --> 01:18:07,702
Wait. Wendy.

1013
01:18:07,780 --> 01:18:10,214
Wendy.

1014
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:13,982
You don't have-- Oh, for--

1015
01:18:14,053 --> 01:18:15,816
Don't do this.

1016
01:18:17,423 --> 01:18:20,950
Come on, Wen, don't--
Hey, do you want me to help? Oh.

1017
01:18:24,596 --> 01:18:26,962
Are you okay?

1018
01:18:27,032 --> 01:18:29,023
Look, I'll call you.

1019
01:18:29,301 --> 01:18:31,098
<i>You double-crosser! You Judas!</i>

1020
01:18:31,170 --> 01:18:33,900
<i>Harry! Harry, go back!</i>

1021
01:18:33,972 --> 01:18:37,874
<i>Turn me in.
Cut my throat for a thousand quid</i>

1022
01:18:37,943 --> 01:18:39,934
<i>Go back, Harry I'll get help</i>

1023
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:41,502
<i>Oh, Harry</i>

1024
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:44,242
<i>All right, go to Kristo.
There you are, Kristo.</i>

1025
01:18:44,316 --> 01:18:47,342
<i>Give her the blood money
she cut my throat for.</i>

1026
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:49,649
Can we please not use
this horrible light?

1027
01:18:49,722 --> 01:18:51,713
It's depressing.

1028
01:18:53,358 --> 01:18:56,987
I bought you this one, Dad.
Remember?

1029
01:18:57,062 --> 01:18:59,758
See how nice this is?

1030
01:19:07,072 --> 01:19:10,166
Wendy?

1031
01:19:10,242 --> 01:19:13,541
What's-What's going on with that?

1032
01:19:13,612 --> 01:19:16,274
It's not gonna affect you in any way.

1033
01:19:16,348 --> 01:19:20,614
They said it was fine for her to stay here as
long as I could prove she's had all her shots.

1034
01:19:20,686 --> 01:19:23,655
I still don't think it's a good idea.

1035
01:19:23,722 --> 01:19:26,782
Well, they like animals here, Jon.

1036
01:19:26,859 --> 01:19:29,054
Apparently, it's good
for the residents' well-being.

1037
01:19:29,128 --> 01:19:31,995
They reduce stress, so if you just
fucking calm down about it.

1038
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:34,589
Hey, hey, hey!

1039
01:19:41,707 --> 01:19:43,368
Dad?

1040
01:19:44,777 --> 01:19:47,644
I want to introduce you to someone.

1041
01:19:49,148 --> 01:19:52,709
- I don't see anything.
- Well, here, let me prop you up.

1042
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:58,654
- Where's your pillow?
- What?

1043
01:19:58,724 --> 01:20:01,090
- Where's Dad's pillow?
- All right, what pillow?

1044
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:04,186
The big red one, the one I bought him.
The one from Urban Outfitters.

1045
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:11,428
You saw it!

1046
01:20:12,471 --> 01:20:14,462
Jesus, Jon!

1047
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:22,076
- Excuse me.
- Hold on a second. Yeah.

1048
01:20:22,147 --> 01:20:24,638
My father has a big red pillow
that I bought for him...

1049
01:20:24,716 --> 01:20:26,707
and it's missing from his room.

1050
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:30,186
I just started my shift.
Try Simone in the lounge.

1051
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,557
- Are you Simone?
- I am.

1052
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:38,960
I'm Lenny Savage's daughter in B-26.

1053
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:41,363
He has a big red pillow I bought him.
It's missing.

1054
01:20:41,433 --> 01:20:43,833
- Did he have his name on it?
- And his room number.

1055
01:20:43,902 --> 01:20:46,700
What's it look like?

1056
01:20:46,772 --> 01:20:49,832
Big... red... pillow.

1057
01:21:07,893 --> 01:21:11,454
Excuse me. Ma'am?

1058
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:13,760
That belongs to my father.

1059
01:21:13,832 --> 01:21:15,823
The pillow.

1060
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:17,994
It doesn't belong to you,
it belongs to my father.

1061
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,560
Huh?

1062
01:21:19,638 --> 01:21:22,607
I'm so sorry.
It doesn't belong to you.

1063
01:21:22,674 --> 01:21:25,472
No!

1064
01:21:25,544 --> 01:21:27,307
You all right?

1065
01:21:29,581 --> 01:21:31,947
Here you go, Dad.

1066
01:21:34,019 --> 01:21:36,510
Dad, I thought you might like this
to help prop you up.

1067
01:21:36,588 --> 01:21:38,522
Lean forward.

1068
01:21:41,793 --> 01:21:43,761
There. Dad!

1069
01:21:43,829 --> 01:21:46,354
- Ah, Wendy, forget it.
- I don't want it.

1070
01:21:46,431 --> 01:21:49,400
Are you sure?
It'll make you more comfortable.

1071
01:21:49,468 --> 01:21:51,800
Come on. Here we go.

1072
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:54,532
I don't want it! Can't you hear?

1073
01:21:56,041 --> 01:21:59,943
What the hell does she think
I'm paying her for? To bother me?

1074
01:22:02,047 --> 01:22:05,039
Wendy, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

1075
01:22:28,173 --> 01:22:30,164
You want one?

1076
01:22:32,110 --> 01:22:34,044
Thanks.

1077
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:41,785
Thank you.

1078
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:48,449
So what's in the box?

1079
01:22:50,929 --> 01:22:52,624
A cat.

1080
01:22:52,698 --> 01:22:55,258
Taking it out for a walk?

1081
01:23:04,309 --> 01:23:06,243
Your cat is cold.

1082
01:23:08,613 --> 01:23:12,242
Come over here.
I'll turn the heat on.

1083
01:23:22,627 --> 01:23:24,618
How's he doing?

1084
01:23:26,198 --> 01:23:28,632
My friend in B-26.

1085
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:30,634
Oh, he's good.

1086
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:34,803
I mean he's not good,
but he's-he's okay. He's fine.

1087
01:23:48,954 --> 01:23:51,047
He likes tater tots.

1088
01:23:52,958 --> 01:23:55,222
It's the only thing he touches sometimes.

1089
01:23:55,293 --> 01:23:57,386
I give him extras when I can.

1090
01:23:57,462 --> 01:23:59,657
Double servings.

1091
01:24:00,732 --> 01:24:03,257
You married?

1092
01:24:03,335 --> 01:24:06,099
No.

1093
01:24:06,171 --> 01:24:08,662
But my boyfriend is.

1094
01:24:08,740 --> 01:24:11,300
Does your mother know
you're doing that?

1095
01:24:12,544 --> 01:24:15,980
She's not really in the picture.

1096
01:24:16,048 --> 01:24:19,313
She dead? That's why
she never comes around, eh?

1097
01:24:19,384 --> 01:24:23,718
No. Just kind of obsolete
in the parenting department.

1098
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:28,288
- She just wasn't very good at it.
- Hmm.

1099
01:24:28,360 --> 01:24:30,760
Neither was my father, actually.

1100
01:24:30,829 --> 01:24:35,596
So that's why a pretty woman doesn't
have a husband or a family of her own.

1101
01:24:40,772 --> 01:24:42,706
What do you do when you're not here?

1102
01:24:45,444 --> 01:24:47,378
I'm a, um--

1103
01:24:47,446 --> 01:24:49,437
a theater person.

1104
01:24:51,049 --> 01:24:54,450
I temp for money, but it's not
my main thing. I write plays.

1105
01:24:54,519 --> 01:24:57,283
Like Shakespeare?

1106
01:24:57,355 --> 01:25:00,847
Yeah. Well, not as good.

1107
01:25:00,926 --> 01:25:03,690
- What are your plays about?
- What, my plays?

1108
01:25:03,762 --> 01:25:06,196
- Can I read one?
- Are you kidding?

1109
01:25:06,264 --> 01:25:10,064
- No, no. - You actually want 
to read one of my plays?

1110
01:25:10,135 --> 01:25:12,194
What's so strange about that?

1111
01:25:12,270 --> 01:25:15,501
No, it's just that, you know,
in my world...

1112
01:25:15,574 --> 01:25:17,872
people don't usually want
to read somebody's...

1113
01:25:17,943 --> 01:25:19,934
unproduced play.

1114
01:25:23,815 --> 01:25:26,750
Your father's doing okay, by the way.

1115
01:25:27,853 --> 01:25:29,844
He's got some time left.

1116
01:25:31,223 --> 01:25:34,818
- How do you know?
- His toes.

1117
01:25:34,893 --> 01:25:37,828
They haven't started to curl under yet.

1118
01:25:37,896 --> 01:25:41,764
The toes, they always curl under
a few days before.

1119
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:47,034
What, is that some kind of Jamaican
folklore thing or something?

1120
01:25:49,107 --> 01:25:52,076
I learned it from being here.

1121
01:25:52,144 --> 01:25:54,772
We all talk about it.
It's always the same.

1122
01:25:54,846 --> 01:25:57,280
- The toes curl?
- Hmm.

1123
01:25:57,349 --> 01:26:00,477
Like the witch in <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

1124
01:26:00,552 --> 01:26:02,952
A couple of days before they go.

1125
01:26:03,021 --> 01:26:05,012
Why, do you think?

1126
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:10,421
They say it's the air leaving the body.

1127
01:26:23,008 --> 01:26:25,203
I'm from Nigeria, by the way.

1128
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:24,325
Wendy.

1129
01:27:49,427 --> 01:27:51,418
Thank you.

1130
01:28:11,449 --> 01:28:13,849
Jon, it's locked.

1131
01:28:13,918 --> 01:28:17,183
Come on. Open it.

1132
01:28:17,255 --> 01:28:21,419
They published the list in the paper,
and your name wasn't on it.

1133
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:23,723
What?

1134
01:28:23,795 --> 01:28:26,764
The Guggenheim Foundation took out
an ad in the New York Times...

1135
01:28:26,831 --> 01:28:29,891
announcing their fellows for the year,
and your name wasn't on it.

1136
01:28:32,170 --> 01:28:34,536
- That's weird.
- Yeah.

1137
01:28:34,606 --> 01:28:36,597
Must have been an oversight.

1138
01:28:36,675 --> 01:28:38,939
Can you-- Can you let me in?
I'm freezing.

1139
01:28:39,010 --> 01:28:40,875
- It-It wasn't.
- What?

1140
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:42,674
An oversight.

1141
01:28:42,747 --> 01:28:44,612
How do you know?

1142
01:28:46,685 --> 01:28:49,518
Because I called
the Guggenheim Foundation.

1143
01:28:49,587 --> 01:28:51,578
Let me in the car.

1144
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:01,298
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

1145
01:29:01,366 --> 01:29:04,335
I called them to find out
why your name wasn't on the list.

1146
01:29:04,402 --> 01:29:07,530
- Why would you do that?
- 'Cause I was looking out for you.

1147
01:29:07,605 --> 01:29:09,835
You were policing me.

1148
01:29:09,908 --> 01:29:12,468
You're sick. That's sick, Jon.

1149
01:29:12,544 --> 01:29:14,739
No. You're sick.

1150
01:29:14,813 --> 01:29:16,804
You're the sick one, Wendy.

1151
01:29:19,951 --> 01:29:23,512
A friend of mine does some consulting
for the Guggenheim Foundation.

1152
01:29:23,588 --> 01:29:25,886
He looked your name up in the computer.

1153
01:29:25,957 --> 01:29:28,152
You've been rejected eight times.

1154
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:32,322
So? How many times
have you been rejected?

1155
01:29:32,397 --> 01:29:34,331
Fuck! That's not the point.

1156
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:36,264
- Six.
- Hmm, no, no.

1157
01:29:36,334 --> 01:29:38,427
The point is you don't think
I have any talent.

1158
01:29:38,503 --> 01:29:40,903
The point is you called them
because you just couldn't believe...

1159
01:29:40,972 --> 01:29:42,906
that your little sister might just get one!

1160
01:29:42,974 --> 01:29:44,999
- Uh, that's not true.
- Yeah, yeah, it is true.

1161
01:29:45,076 --> 01:29:47,408
You're just like him. He never thought
I could do anything either.

1162
01:29:47,479 --> 01:29:50,312
- Why are you comparing me to Dad?
- Comparing you to--

1163
01:29:50,382 --> 01:29:52,907
- What is the point?
- No! You don't think I have talent.

1164
01:29:52,984 --> 01:29:54,918
You just don't think I can do anything.

1165
01:29:54,986 --> 01:29:57,352
You obviously don't think
you can do anything either...

1166
01:29:57,422 --> 01:29:59,151
because you have to fucking lie about itl

1167
01:29:59,224 --> 01:30:01,692
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm out of my mind?

1168
01:30:52,911 --> 01:30:56,108
- Where'd you get the money from, Wen?
- I got a grant.

1169
01:30:56,181 --> 01:30:59,173
- Just cut the crap, Wendy.
- I got a grant, Jon! I did.

1170
01:31:01,553 --> 01:31:04,488
Okay, fine,
I didn't win a Guggenheim.

1171
01:31:05,523 --> 01:31:07,548
Big fucking deal.

1172
01:31:08,860 --> 01:31:10,794
It was a different kind of grant.

1173
01:31:10,862 --> 01:31:13,126
- What kind?
- What?

1174
01:31:13,198 --> 01:31:16,190
You got a different kind of grant.
What'd you get?

1175
01:31:19,270 --> 01:31:21,204
FEMA.

1176
01:31:21,272 --> 01:31:23,240
What? I never heard of that.

1177
01:31:25,877 --> 01:31:28,437
FEMA.

1178
01:31:28,513 --> 01:31:30,504
FEMA?

1179
01:31:32,951 --> 01:31:36,079
You mean FEMA,
Federal Emergency Management?

1180
01:31:36,154 --> 01:31:38,088
You took money from FEMA?

1181
01:31:38,156 --> 01:31:40,090
I was granted the money.

1182
01:31:40,158 --> 01:31:42,626
What was the federal emergency?

1183
01:31:42,694 --> 01:31:44,889
9/11.

1184
01:31:44,963 --> 01:31:47,090
What does that have to do with you?

1185
01:31:47,165 --> 01:31:50,396
I worked downtown. I was affected.

1186
01:31:50,468 --> 01:31:52,902
Everyone was affected.
The whole world was affected.

1187
01:31:52,971 --> 01:31:55,804
That doesn't mean they're going around
taking money from people who really need it.

1188
01:31:55,874 --> 01:32:00,470
There was no work for months.
All the temps-- All the temps applied.

1189
01:32:00,545 --> 01:32:02,775
I was not the first one to--

1190
01:32:04,616 --> 01:32:07,278
Look, I-I am trying
to get my life together.

1191
01:32:07,352 --> 01:32:10,219
- By stealing money from the federal government?
- I did not steal it!

1192
01:32:10,288 --> 01:32:11,949
There's a thing where you can apply...

1193
01:32:12,023 --> 01:32:15,254
if you lost 25% of your salary
or something like that!

1194
01:32:15,326 --> 01:32:18,693
I don't remember the details.
You call FEMA, you ask them.

1195
01:32:18,763 --> 01:32:21,630
- I'm not. - Look, they care about 
me more than you do.

1196
01:32:21,699 --> 01:32:24,224
I'm not calling FEMA.
Okay?

1197
01:32:24,302 --> 01:32:27,066
- I'm sorry.
- Ha, ha.

1198
01:33:21,593 --> 01:33:25,757
Hello. Yes.

1199
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:28,765
No, it's okay. What-What's wrong?
Is he all right?

1200
01:33:31,235 --> 01:33:33,169
What?

1201
01:33:37,041 --> 01:33:41,478
Okay. Okay, uh, I understand.
We'll, uh-- We'll be right over.

1202
01:33:41,546 --> 01:33:43,377
Thank you.

1203
01:33:43,448 --> 01:33:46,246
- Is he okay?
- It's-It's not Dad. It's Genghis.

1204
01:33:48,219 --> 01:33:50,187
She got in a fight with that other cat.

1205
01:33:50,254 --> 01:33:52,814
They want us to get her out of there now.

1206
01:33:54,258 --> 01:33:57,056
I told you that cat was a bad idea.

1207
01:34:04,402 --> 01:34:05,869
Genghis.

1208
01:34:05,937 --> 01:34:08,497
- Hi.
- Hi.

1209
01:34:08,573 --> 01:34:11,701
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1210
01:34:11,776 --> 01:34:13,971
They were getting along fine before.

1211
01:34:14,045 --> 01:34:16,206
She's under here.
She won't come out.

1212
01:34:17,682 --> 01:34:19,616
Genghis.

1213
01:34:19,684 --> 01:34:22,619
Sometimes, if you just ignore her,
she comes.

1214
01:34:22,687 --> 01:34:24,052
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1215
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:39,030
I read your play.

1216
01:34:39,103 --> 01:34:42,300
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

1217
01:34:42,373 --> 01:34:45,206
I liked it.

1218
01:34:45,276 --> 01:34:47,335
- No way. Really?
- Yeah.

1219
01:34:50,715 --> 01:34:53,707
You didn't think it was a bunch
of middle-class whining?

1220
01:34:53,785 --> 01:34:55,776
No.

1221
01:34:57,288 --> 01:35:00,280
I was scared you'd think
I was some spoiled American...

1222
01:35:00,358 --> 01:35:03,657
who's complaining about
her difficult childhood.

1223
01:35:03,728 --> 01:35:05,992
No, not at all.

1224
01:35:06,064 --> 01:35:08,794
I thought it was sad.

1225
01:35:25,183 --> 01:35:28,550
- I should probably go back to work.
- Okay, I am-- I'm sorry.

1226
01:35:28,619 --> 01:35:30,246
- No, no, no.
- I'm sorry.

1227
01:35:30,321 --> 01:35:32,414
- No, no, no, no, no.
- I am so gross.

1228
01:35:32,490 --> 01:35:34,515
No, you-you're great.

1229
01:35:34,592 --> 01:35:37,322
- I am-- I am gross.
- No, no. No, you're great.

1230
01:35:37,395 --> 01:35:41,331
It's just... I'm in love
with my girlfriend.

1231
01:35:44,268 --> 01:35:46,862
I-I know it sounds like corn,
but, really, I--

1232
01:35:46,938 --> 01:35:49,873
No.

1233
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:52,136
It's not corny.

1234
01:35:55,213 --> 01:35:57,943
Look who it is.

1235
01:35:59,484 --> 01:36:02,180
Genghis.

1236
01:36:03,254 --> 01:36:05,245
Pop the trunk.

1237
01:36:38,356 --> 01:36:42,190
Here, there's emotion, an interest
in what people are feeling.

1238
01:36:44,595 --> 01:36:47,063
Whereas Brecht wants people to think.

1239
01:36:49,934 --> 01:36:52,926
In dramatic theater,
you have suggestion...

1240
01:36:55,139 --> 01:36:58,734
but Brecht wants an argument.

1241
01:37:02,680 --> 01:37:04,671
Excuse me one minute.

1242
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:07,884
Hello?

1243
01:37:09,053 --> 01:37:10,987
Yes, it is.

1244
01:37:20,698 --> 01:37:23,030
Okay, thank you.

1245
01:37:29,774 --> 01:37:32,299
Mr. Savage?

1246
01:37:33,678 --> 01:37:36,943
Um, what's the difference
between plot and narrative?

1247
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,916
Sorry. You wrote it on the board.

1248
01:39:04,235 --> 01:39:06,169
Jon.

1249
01:39:06,237 --> 01:39:08,967
Jon.

1250
01:39:10,041 --> 01:39:11,975
Yeah?

1251
01:39:30,861 --> 01:39:32,795
That's it?

1252
01:39:39,303 --> 01:39:41,271
Yeah.

1253
01:39:56,721 --> 01:39:59,383
Excuse me.

1254
01:43:09,146 --> 01:43:11,046
Hi.

1255
01:43:11,115 --> 01:43:13,413
Hi.

1256
01:43:15,419 --> 01:43:18,081
These are for you.

1257
01:43:18,155 --> 01:43:20,783
Thank you.

1258
01:43:22,526 --> 01:43:24,824
Yeah, they don't have a smell.
They're from the deli.

1259
01:43:24,895 --> 01:43:27,125
I never understand why that is
with flowers from there.

1260
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:31,567
Guess you have to go to a real florist
and pay extra if you want the nice smell.

1261
01:43:35,306 --> 01:43:37,297
Can I come in for a minute?

1262
01:43:44,181 --> 01:43:46,115
Where's Marley?

1263
01:43:48,252 --> 01:43:51,187
She's not-- uh--

1264
01:43:51,255 --> 01:43:53,917
I wasn't gonna get into this.

1265
01:43:53,991 --> 01:43:57,290
Must seem ridiculous compared
to what you've been going through.

1266
01:43:57,361 --> 01:44:00,125
You had a human being die on you.

1267
01:44:00,197 --> 01:44:01,755
She's dead?

1268
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,191
We're gonna do it tomorrow.

1269
01:44:07,137 --> 01:44:10,698
Her hips-- She can't get around anymore.
She can't get up on the bed.

1270
01:44:10,774 --> 01:44:14,642
She's so depressed.

1271
01:44:14,712 --> 01:44:16,737
There's a surgery, but the vet says...

1272
01:44:16,814 --> 01:44:20,978
there are no guarantees
and the rehabilitation's brutal.

1273
01:44:24,722 --> 01:44:26,815
She's old, Wen.

1274
01:44:26,890 --> 01:44:29,450
She's in pain.

1275
01:44:54,451 --> 01:44:56,646
I'm sorry about your dad.

1276
01:45:02,660 --> 01:45:06,096
If you ever want to re-indulge
in unhealthy, compromising behavior...

1277
01:45:06,163 --> 01:45:08,097
you know who to call, right?

1278
01:45:21,045 --> 01:45:23,843
Larry? Can I ask you a question?

1279
01:45:25,149 --> 01:45:27,549
Not about us.

1280
01:45:33,457 --> 01:45:35,118
<i>Go left.</i>

1281
01:45:36,126 --> 01:45:37,616
<i>Good, do it one more time.</i>

1282
01:45:42,166 --> 01:45:44,691
No, he doesn't know
what's happening.

1283
01:45:44,768 --> 01:45:46,759
Let's do it again.

1284
01:45:46,837 --> 01:45:49,135
So walk away
and then pace around a little.

1285
01:45:49,206 --> 01:45:52,039
And, Max, watch TV.

1286
01:45:52,109 --> 01:45:55,203
What did I tell you
about doing your chores before...

1287
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:57,247
watching TV, huh?

1288
01:45:58,816 --> 01:46:01,717
Stop and turn around like it's over.

1289
01:46:04,455 --> 01:46:06,446
Should I react once he goes up?

1290
01:46:19,903 --> 01:46:21,928
Do you think it's too much?

1291
01:46:22,005 --> 01:46:24,872
No, it's, uh--

1292
01:46:24,942 --> 01:46:26,876
it's, um--

1293
01:46:27,878 --> 01:46:30,870
the, uh-- the naturalism with the--

1294
01:46:30,948 --> 01:46:34,907
the magic realism together,
it-it's effective.

1295
01:46:34,985 --> 01:46:36,816
Are you crying?

1296
01:46:43,927 --> 01:46:45,895
Thanks for coming.

1297
01:46:45,963 --> 01:46:47,931
Thanks for inviting me. I'll, uh--

1298
01:46:47,998 --> 01:46:51,991
- I'll see the real thing 
when I come back through. - Okay.

1299
01:46:52,069 --> 01:46:56,005
Do you hate me for using stuff
from your life in the play?

1300
01:46:56,073 --> 01:46:59,270
No. It's fine.

1301
01:46:59,343 --> 01:47:02,676
- You don't think it's self-important
and bourgeois? - No, it's good.

1302
01:47:02,746 --> 01:47:05,647
Wendy, it's really good.

1303
01:47:05,716 --> 01:47:09,948
JFK, please.
Wish me luck on my paper.

1304
01:47:11,255 --> 01:47:13,348
What's it called?

1305
01:47:13,424 --> 01:47:15,358
"No Laughing Matter:

1306
01:47:15,426 --> 01:47:17,724
Dark Comedy in the Plays
of Bertolt Brecht. "

1307
01:47:19,930 --> 01:47:22,763
- Bad title?
- No, it's good. It's good.

1308
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:24,767
No, I like it.

1309
01:47:24,835 --> 01:47:28,202
- Where's the conference?
- Poland.

1310
01:47:28,272 --> 01:47:30,035
You didn't tell me that.

1311
01:47:30,107 --> 01:47:32,735
You didn't ask.

1312
01:47:35,913 --> 01:47:38,541
Just gonna check in with-- you know.

1313
01:47:38,615 --> 01:47:41,049
Play it by ear, see how we...

1314
01:47:41,118 --> 01:47:43,609
feel about each other's people and--

1315
01:47:55,599 --> 01:47:57,533
It's really good.

1316
01:48:00,571 --> 01:48:02,505
Okay.

1317
01:48:56,193 --> 01:48:58,252
Come on, baby. Come on.

1318
01:48:59,329 --> 01:49:01,263
