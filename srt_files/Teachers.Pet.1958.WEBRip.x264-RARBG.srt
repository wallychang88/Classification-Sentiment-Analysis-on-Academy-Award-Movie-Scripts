Now you can see the elevators

27
00:02:33,564 --> 00:02:35,634
leading up to
the executive offices.

28
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,773
That's it, step right in,
ladies and gentlemen.

29
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:39,836
That's the idea.
That's fine.

30
00:02:39,837 --> 00:02:42,767
And now if you'll just get up
a little closer to the table

31
00:02:42,773 --> 00:02:45,742
you'll all be able to view
this room quite well.

32
00:02:45,743 --> 00:02:47,881
This, ladies and gentlemen,
is the City Room,

33
00:02:47,882 --> 00:02:49,908
the heart center
of every newspaper.

34
00:02:49,913 --> 00:02:51,583
Here you see only a handful

35
00:02:51,584 --> 00:02:53,782
of the 2,500 highly-trained
specialists

36
00:02:53,784 --> 00:02:55,954
employed by
the Evening Chronicle.

37
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:57,922
Men and women
who work tirelessly,

38
00:02:57,923 --> 00:02:59,621
not only in this vast building,

39
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:01,423
but in every country
in the world.

40
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:03,225
Editors, reporters,
photographers,

41
00:03:03,226 --> 00:03:06,056
who become your eyes and ears
in war and peace,

42
00:03:06,063 --> 00:03:08,470
who make it possible for you
to sit in your arm chair

43
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:10,396
and witness history
in the making.

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,800
Men and women who uphold

45
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:14,072
the highest tradition
of American journalism

46
00:03:14,073 --> 00:03:16,671
and are dedicated
to the task of making you

47
00:03:16,674 --> 00:03:19,914
the best-informed newspaper
reader on this earth.

48
00:03:21,645 --> 00:03:23,375
These are
some of the papers you saw

49
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,980
printed only a few minutes ago.

50
00:03:24,982 --> 00:03:26,882
These first copies
are rushed up here

51
00:03:26,884 --> 00:03:29,053
to be distributed among
the editors and reporters

52
00:03:29,054 --> 00:03:31,592
so they can be checked in case
there are any mistakes.

53
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,219
Now, in this department,

54
00:03:33,223 --> 00:03:35,692
all the news of the city is
funneled through the City Desk...

55
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:37,593
Which one's the city editor?

56
00:03:37,595 --> 00:03:39,425
I'll get to that
in a moment, madam.

57
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:40,759
Headed by the city editor

58
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,164
who is seated over there

59
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:44,495
in the center of the room
facing his entire staff.

60
00:03:44,502 --> 00:03:46,969
That's Mr. Gannon.
Yes?

61
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,070
Mr. Gannon. Yes,
James Gannon, yes, madam.

62
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:51,072
And at the far end of the room
is the office

63
00:03:51,074 --> 00:03:53,981
of our managing editor,
whose name is Lloyd Crowley.

64
00:03:53,982 --> 00:03:57,847
And down the hall, Colonel
J.R. Ballantine, our publisher.

65
00:03:57,848 --> 00:03:59,578
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

66
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,152
what you may find
of interest next

67
00:04:01,153 --> 00:04:03,689
is what we term in newspaper
parlance the morgue.

68
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,887
So if you'll just follow me
right over here,

69
00:04:05,889 --> 00:04:08,589
I'll be very happy
to show you what we have.

70
00:04:36,854 --> 00:04:38,354
Mr. Gannon,
could I talk to you...

71
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:40,315
I don't care what his brother
thinks of him.

72
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:41,623
That won't sell a paper.

73
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:43,085
Get me a quote with lace on it.

74
00:04:43,093 --> 00:04:44,293
Mr. Gannon...
Archard!

75
00:04:44,294 --> 00:04:46,763
Where's the city hall story?
Can I talk to you?

76
00:04:46,764 --> 00:04:48,364
You want to talk
to me about what?

77
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,995
My son.

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,570
Look, madam, I don't know
how you got in here

79
00:04:51,571 --> 00:04:53,238
or who you are,
but I've got a...

80
00:04:53,239 --> 00:04:56,606
I'm Mrs. Kovac. My Barney
works for you. That's who I am.

81
00:04:56,607 --> 00:04:58,367
Oh.

82
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,475
Barney's mother?

83
00:05:00,477 --> 00:05:01,777
Why, glad to meet you.

84
00:05:01,779 --> 00:05:03,379
Yeah, I bet you are.

85
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,918
Say, Jim, Fisher's calling in.
He's down at Bellevue.

86
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,246
Some dame tried to
commit suicide over a guy.

87
00:05:08,251 --> 00:05:10,251
Swallowed a whole bottle
of sleeping pills.

88
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:12,391
Now that's the business
to be in: sleeping pills.

89
00:05:12,392 --> 00:05:13,719
You wanna send a cameraman?

90
00:05:13,724 --> 00:05:15,164
That depends
on who she is. Find out...

91
00:05:15,165 --> 00:05:16,658
Wait a minute.

92
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,628
- Mr. Gannon.
- Yeah, uh-huh.

93
00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:20,229
No, he says they
just pumped out her stomach,

94
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,798
and all they got was
a quart of bourbon.

95
00:05:21,799 --> 00:05:22,999
That's not
a bad business either.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,630
In that case, no pictures.

97
00:05:24,635 --> 00:05:26,365
Listen, I been trying for
weeks to see you.

98
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:28,708
I can't get you on the phone.
I have to take a tour.

99
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:30,336
What are you, the president?

100
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:31,840
We've got a paper to get out,

101
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,742
and your boy helps us do it.
You should be proud.

102
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:34,984
Why? He's just an errand boy.

103
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:36,478
Copy boy.
Same thing.

104
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,819
Do you want me to start him
as managing editor?

105
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,316
I want you to fire him.

106
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:44,318
Mr. Gannon,
he's gotta go back to school.

107
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:46,221
What for?

108
00:05:46,223 --> 00:05:47,823
What for?

109
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:50,055
Because I want him
to get educated, what for.

110
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
So did his father.

111
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:54,532
Mr. Gannon, his father
worked all his life

112
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:57,066
in an overcoat factory
on 7th Avenue.

113
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:59,067
He took a dictionary
along with him

114
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:00,499
every day in his lunch pail.

115
00:06:00,503 --> 00:06:02,103
"But, Edna," he said to me,

116
00:06:02,105 --> 00:06:04,065
God rest his soul, he said,
"You get Barney educated.

117
00:06:04,074 --> 00:06:06,044
That's the golden key."

118
00:06:06,045 --> 00:06:07,943
Gannon.

119
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,505
Try it tomorrow. This is okay.

120
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:12,251
Ahem, Andrews'll get you
quotes from the deputy mayor

121
00:06:12,252 --> 00:06:14,379
and you and he
can get together on a sidebar.

122
00:06:14,384 --> 00:06:15,624
Did you hear what I just said?

123
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,286
Certainly.

124
00:06:17,287 --> 00:06:19,187
He took the dictionary with him
every day in his lunch pail.

125
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:20,919
"Edna," he said,
God rest his soul,

126
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:23,894
"Get Barney educated.
That's the golden key."

127
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:31,629
With all due respect,
Mrs. Kovac,

128
00:06:31,635 --> 00:06:33,265
you see
that fancy-Dan over there

129
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,040
clipping pictures
out of the paper?

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,775
He's got a golden key:

131
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:40,376
Phi Beta Kappa.

132
00:06:41,645 --> 00:06:44,075
I keep him around for laughs.

133
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,921
Uh, you, uh, wanna see
something else?

134
00:06:48,218 --> 00:06:50,418
This, uh, letter
from some professor

135
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,550
up at the university,

136
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:55,855
E.R., uh, Stone.

137
00:06:55,859 --> 00:06:58,798
Would I, uh, favor them
by appearing as guest lecturer

138
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:01,656
in one of their night school
journalism classes?

139
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,925
Me, Jim Gannon,
who never went to high school.

140
00:07:03,934 --> 00:07:05,872
So what's it got
to do with Barney?

141
00:07:05,873 --> 00:07:07,599
Barney wants to be
a newspaperman.

142
00:07:07,604 --> 00:07:09,642
He'll never learn that
in school.

143
00:07:09,643 --> 00:07:11,209
Your baby's grown up,
Mrs. Kovac.

144
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:13,708
He's old enough to decide
his future for himself.

145
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:15,241
Yeah, how can he decide

146
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:16,845
when he don't even know
what he don't know?

147
00:07:16,847 --> 00:07:19,877
Mr. Gannon, I think
if he was educated,

148
00:07:19,883 --> 00:07:21,253
who could tell
what he could find...

149
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:23,119
I'll tell you one thing
he won't find

150
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,590
is another chance
like he's got here with me.

151
00:07:24,591 --> 00:07:26,255
I'm teaching him his business.

152
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:28,286
During lunch, I let him
take a whack at a news story.

153
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:30,591
Then when I get the chance,
I show him his mistakes.

154
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:33,803
I didn't need him, I just put
him on as an extra because...

155
00:07:33,804 --> 00:07:35,767
You wanna play father?

156
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,697
Oh, Mr. Gannon,
kids don't come that easy.

157
00:07:39,703 --> 00:07:41,270
You have one first.

158
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,771
You wash his diapers,
you stay up nights with him.

159
00:07:43,774 --> 00:07:46,843
You love him and you worry about
him like for about 18 years

160
00:07:46,844 --> 00:07:48,244
and then maybe...

161
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:50,305
Maybe you have a right
to tell him what to do.

162
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:56,848
Gannon.

163
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,521
Oh, hello, Peggy.

164
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,732
Yeah. How are you, honey?

165
00:08:02,826 --> 00:08:04,826
Sure. Sure,
I can see you tonight.

166
00:08:04,828 --> 00:08:06,928
It's Tuesday. Aren't you
gonna play poker?

167
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,770
Oh, I have
a very important conference,

168
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:11,896
but I could, uh,
get there for the last show.

169
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:15,037
What? A new joint?
The Bongo Club?

170
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,868
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.
I know where it is.

171
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,275
Yeah, I'll see you later, honey.

172
00:08:25,148 --> 00:08:28,088
All right, Mrs. Kovac,
I'll talk to Barney.

173
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,760
You will?

174
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,920
Like a Dutch uncle.

175
00:08:34,925 --> 00:08:37,855
Or is that still
too closely related?

176
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:40,396
Oh, my! Oh!

177
00:08:40,397 --> 00:08:42,997
I've been having such
a hard time with that boy.

178
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,600
Oh, relax.
He's a very fine boy.

179
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:45,835
Thank you.

180
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,036
We're very proud of him.

181
00:08:47,037 --> 00:08:49,705
Oh, thank you very much.

182
00:08:49,706 --> 00:08:52,036
Thank you.

183
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:53,479
Goodbye, Mrs. Kovac.
Bye-bye.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,706
Pleasure to see you.

185
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:56,979
Jim. Here's the new murder lead.

186
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,949
Is that the way you want it?

187
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,250
Yeah, it's all right.

188
00:09:01,251 --> 00:09:02,921
Mr. Crowley
wants to see you right away.

189
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:04,550
Okay, Barney.
Oh, by the way...

190
00:09:04,554 --> 00:09:06,923
I know you're gonna fire me.
I just saw her going out.

191
00:09:06,924 --> 00:09:08,991
I told her not to come.

192
00:09:08,992 --> 00:09:10,261
I told her I won't go to school

193
00:09:10,262 --> 00:09:12,028
no matter what anyone said...

194
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,897
Now, wait a minute, kid.
Wait a minute, slow down.

195
00:09:13,898 --> 00:09:15,457
I didn't tell her
I was gonna fire you.

196
00:09:15,465 --> 00:09:17,725
I just said I'd talk to you
like a Dutch uncle.

197
00:09:17,734 --> 00:09:20,244
And maybe I will
one of these days.

198
00:09:21,104 --> 00:09:22,504
Gee, thanks, Mr. Gannon.

199
00:09:22,505 --> 00:09:23,805
Oh, uh, Barney,

200
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:26,637
I, uh, I read
this story of yours.

201
00:09:26,643 --> 00:09:29,278
Stinks, huh?
Well...

202
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,979
Barney, I...

203
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,650
C'mon, we'll talk about it
on the fly.

204
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:35,349
Now in the first place... Oh,
by the way, you heard about it?

205
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:36,922
What?
They found him dead.

206
00:09:36,923 --> 00:09:38,150
Who?
The boss.

207
00:09:38,155 --> 00:09:40,315
No kidding! When?
A few minutes ago.

208
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:42,023
Where'd they find him?
In his office.

209
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,825
How'd it happen?
Well, some dame shot him.

210
00:09:43,827 --> 00:09:45,627
Some dame? Why?

211
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:48,097
Barney, you just asked me
six very important questions.

212
00:09:48,098 --> 00:09:49,598
Who, what, where,
when, how, and why?

213
00:09:49,599 --> 00:09:51,599
That's what every news story
should answer.

214
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:53,801
You haven't done it.

215
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:56,943
Gee, Mr. Gannon, you had me...
Had me half scared to death.

216
00:09:56,944 --> 00:10:00,240
Rewrite it.
Yes, sir.

217
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:01,843
Miss Hughes,
may I use your typewriter?

218
00:10:01,845 --> 00:10:03,545
Yes, Barney, I'm all through.

219
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:22,131
Now, Jim, what do you mean
you're not going?

220
00:10:22,132 --> 00:10:24,502
I sent you a special memo
to take care of it.

221
00:10:24,503 --> 00:10:26,068
I did take care of it.

222
00:10:26,069 --> 00:10:29,939
I wrote a nice long letter.
You got a copy of it.

223
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,840
Yes, I certainly did, Jim.

224
00:10:31,841 --> 00:10:33,910
And I told the professor
that he was...

225
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:37,346
It's not a he, it's a she.

226
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,147
Well, I'm glad I didn't know
that when I wrote that letter,

227
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,719
or I would have really sound...

228
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,018
Do you mean to tell me
that now they've got dames

229
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:46,221
teaching unsuspecting
suckers how to...

230
00:10:46,223 --> 00:10:47,689
Now, Jim.

231
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,760
I'm not supposed to get excited.

232
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:51,627
I don't want to get excited.

233
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:53,128
But when I read your letter...

234
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,430
I just wrote exactly

235
00:10:54,431 --> 00:10:56,431
what I thought
of journalism classes.

236
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:58,473
You wouldn't want me
to lie, would you?

237
00:10:58,474 --> 00:10:59,698
Oh, yes, I would.

238
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,741
Oh, you know as well as I do
it's a waste of time.

239
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:04,869
Where did you learn
the newspaper business?

240
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,244
Working for a newspaper,

241
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:08,081
and not sitting
with your nose in a book

242
00:11:08,082 --> 00:11:09,778
at some cockamamie university.

243
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,709
Oh, now, now, Jim.

244
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:14,616
The colonel
who pays your salary and mine

245
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:18,347
is on the board of trustees
at that cockamamie university.

246
00:11:18,355 --> 00:11:21,385
And last year, they gave him
an honorary degree.

247
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,025
Yeah, they pass those things out

248
00:11:23,026 --> 00:11:24,286
like somebody dealing
a poker hand.

249
00:11:24,294 --> 00:11:26,932
But the colonel
is proud of that degree.

250
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,430
And I'm sure
he wouldn't want you

251
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,169
to do anything to embarrass him

252
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,997
at that cockamamie university.

253
00:11:32,002 --> 00:11:35,202
Look, Crowley,
I don't like eggheads.

254
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:36,665
I don't like colleges.

255
00:11:36,673 --> 00:11:39,143
I can't even stand
the smell of chalk.

256
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,712
Now please don't ask me...

257
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:41,910
Jim.

258
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,946
Now, don't get me wrong.

259
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:46,247
I'm not asking you
to go up there.

260
00:11:46,249 --> 00:11:48,449
I am telling you to go!

261
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,751
And you get there early and
apologize to that woman or...

262
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:53,722
All right, all right.
If you really want me to go.

263
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:56,663
Yes, Jim. I want you to go.

264
00:11:57,927 --> 00:12:00,027
No trouble. No trouble.
Thanks.

265
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,560
Thanks.

266
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,139
Uh, could you tell me
where I could find

267
00:12:44,141 --> 00:12:46,181
Professor Stone's
journalism class?

268
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,876
On the right.
Room 102.

269
00:12:47,877 --> 00:12:50,377
No smoking in the building,
please.

270
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:53,715
Here you are.

271
00:12:53,716 --> 00:12:55,216
Thank you.

272
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,700
Excuse me.

273
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,120
Oh, is Professor Stone around?

274
00:13:32,122 --> 00:13:34,362
She'll be here in a minute.

275
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:39,695
Good evening.

276
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:41,526
Good evening.

277
00:13:41,531 --> 00:13:42,731
Evening.

278
00:13:45,935 --> 00:13:48,165
Oh, could I have
a few words with you

279
00:13:48,171 --> 00:13:49,871
before the class starts?
With me?

280
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:53,342
Yes. You see, there's a little
something I'd like to explain.

281
00:13:53,343 --> 00:13:55,643
Uh, you know, it's like I said
to some of the boys,

282
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,905
anybody who teaches journalism

283
00:13:57,914 --> 00:13:59,248
has gotta have a sense of humor.

284
00:13:59,249 --> 00:14:00,519
You know what I mean, professor?

285
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,147
You see, when I first got that...

286
00:14:02,152 --> 00:14:03,452
Professor?

287
00:14:03,453 --> 00:14:05,821
Yeah, when you sent me the...

288
00:14:05,822 --> 00:14:07,122
Aren't you Professor Stone?

289
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:09,425
No. Clara Dibney.

290
00:14:09,426 --> 00:14:11,826
I think we can begin now.

291
00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:17,829
Oh, would someone
close the door please?

292
00:14:17,834 --> 00:14:19,404
Everyone be seated.

293
00:14:25,175 --> 00:14:26,805
Everyone.

294
00:14:32,982 --> 00:14:34,616
Thank you very much.

295
00:14:34,617 --> 00:14:37,347
And welcome to this survey
course in journalism.

296
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:40,224
I see a few familiar faces
from last semester,

297
00:14:40,225 --> 00:14:42,423
and, of course, many new ones.

298
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,325
I don't know
quite what you expected

299
00:14:44,327 --> 00:14:46,657
but, um, I hope that
you won't be too disappointed.

300
00:14:48,898 --> 00:14:52,868
You know, we have been
very lucky every year

301
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:55,469
to have had some of the really
top men in the newspaper field

302
00:14:55,472 --> 00:14:57,072
come and talk to us.

303
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:59,875
Men from The Times, the Tribune,

304
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,976
Daily News and many others.

305
00:15:01,978 --> 00:15:03,578
So tonight, to start us off,

306
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:06,480
we invited James Gannon,
city editor of the Chronicle.

307
00:15:06,483 --> 00:15:09,485
Unfortunately, however,
he is not with us.

308
00:15:09,486 --> 00:15:12,586
In his place,
Mr. Gannon sent a letter.

309
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:14,619
And although
it's addressed to me,

310
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:16,784
I feel that, uh, this is
something you all should hear.

311
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,396
"My dear Professor Stone."

312
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,429
At least I'm grateful
for the promotion.

313
00:15:24,434 --> 00:15:27,441
"Thank you for the flattery
implied in your request

314
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:30,167
"that I appear as guest lecturer
in your journalism class.

315
00:15:30,173 --> 00:15:32,273
"Thank you, but no, thanks.

316
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:35,975
"If you've ever been inside
a real, live newspaper office

317
00:15:35,978 --> 00:15:38,447
"you'll remember that
a city editor's job

318
00:15:38,448 --> 00:15:40,478
"is to get out a daily paper.

319
00:15:40,483 --> 00:15:43,053
"Unfortunately, that doesn't
leave him much time

320
00:15:43,054 --> 00:15:46,391
"for such pleasant diversions
as bridge luncheons,

321
00:15:46,392 --> 00:15:48,589
"guided tours
through Rockefeller Center,

322
00:15:48,591 --> 00:15:50,526
"the canning of crabapples,

323
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,195
"and lectures
to journalism classes.

324
00:15:54,597 --> 00:15:57,566
"Maybe it's just as well.
If I came,

325
00:15:57,567 --> 00:16:00,536
"I might get carried away by the
spirit of academic integrity,

326
00:16:00,537 --> 00:16:03,567
"and tell your unsuspecting
students the truth.

327
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:06,613
"That the only way
to learn about the fourth estate

328
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:09,278
"is with first-hand experience.

329
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,209
"In the school I graduated from

330
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:14,553
"there were no lectures without
four-letter words in them.

331
00:16:14,554 --> 00:16:17,421
"No books except those thrown
at you to wake you up.

332
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:20,055
"No degrees besides the third.

333
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:21,686
"Information was gotten

334
00:16:21,691 --> 00:16:25,331
"by keeping your eyes and ears
open and your nose clean.

335
00:16:25,332 --> 00:16:28,697
"Inspiration by
a swift kick in the pants.

336
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,028
"To sum it up,

337
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,532
"I think
you're wasting your time

338
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,169
"and I prefer not to waste mine.

339
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,105
Yours truly, James Gannon."

340
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:41,306
Any comments?

341
00:16:42,312 --> 00:16:44,780
Yeah.
Who does he think he is?

342
00:16:44,781 --> 00:16:47,749
Oh, he must've been joking
or something.

343
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:51,850
No, I'm afraid
he was quite serious.

344
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:55,924
You see, I happen to know
Mr. Gannon very well.

345
00:16:55,925 --> 00:16:57,325
As a matter of fact,

346
00:16:57,327 --> 00:16:59,597
I can give you a perfect
picture of this man,

347
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:01,226
without ever having seen him.

348
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,700
He works, I'm sure,

349
00:17:05,702 --> 00:17:08,502
with a cigarette dangling from
his mouth, like so.

350
00:17:08,505 --> 00:17:11,135
In a suit that he hasn't had
pressed in months.

351
00:17:13,009 --> 00:17:15,739
And, of course,
he has the battered old hat

352
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:18,615
that he wouldn't give up
for the crown of England.

353
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,218
Poker comes easy to him,

354
00:17:23,219 --> 00:17:25,749
but, oh, boy, he drinks hard.

355
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,715
After he's had a few,
he'll always tell you:

356
00:17:28,725 --> 00:17:32,695
"Why, I never even got to high
school, and I'm proud of it."

357
00:17:33,996 --> 00:17:35,526
Then, of course, he'll, uh...

358
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:38,832
Oh, and he boasts about his
exploits with the ladies.

359
00:17:38,835 --> 00:17:42,365
Of course he'll never
marry anyone but his job.

360
00:17:42,372 --> 00:17:44,606
In short, he's a perfect example

361
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:46,637
of that dying race,

362
00:17:46,643 --> 00:17:49,378
the unpressed gentlemen
of the press.

363
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:53,518
I hardly have to stand up here

364
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,316
and defend education.

365
00:17:55,318 --> 00:17:58,048
As my father always said,

366
00:17:58,054 --> 00:18:01,394
"Education teaches a man
how to spell experience."

367
00:18:01,395 --> 00:18:03,058
Hear, hear!

368
00:18:03,059 --> 00:18:06,498
So I shall continue wasting my
time, as Mr. Gannon put it,

369
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:08,526
teaching you about
reporting, copy reading,

370
00:18:08,531 --> 00:18:09,831
makeup, and rewrite.

371
00:18:09,832 --> 00:18:12,232
And we'll let Mr. Gannon
throw books,

372
00:18:12,234 --> 00:18:13,840
and kick young men in the pants,

373
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,296
and continue to be one
of the few relics

374
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:17,735
of antiquity on display

375
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,280
outside the Museum
of Natural History.

376
00:18:22,712 --> 00:18:24,680
What about this dame!

377
00:18:24,681 --> 00:18:28,081
Did she tell this jerk off
or did she tell him off?

378
00:18:30,186 --> 00:18:32,286
Oh, yes, Miss
Fuller has the textbooks,

379
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:34,688
the daily papers, and if you'll
just pick up a few copies,

380
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,221
I think we could get started.

381
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,659
Information.

382
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:12,590
Yes.

383
00:19:12,595 --> 00:19:14,355
Yes, that class was tonight.

384
00:19:16,132 --> 00:19:18,472
Oh, but you can still enroll.

385
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:23,338
Well, I would suggest
that you drop by tomorrow.

386
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:25,639
I think that would be
a very good...

387
00:19:34,617 --> 00:19:36,617
And another thing:

388
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:38,519
I don't mind you taking
that creep to lunch,

389
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:41,421
but why does it
have to cost $6.60?

390
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:44,934
Where do you think you're
working? Harper's Bazaar?

391
00:19:46,128 --> 00:19:47,528
What happened?

392
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,830
I still don't know.

393
00:19:48,831 --> 00:19:50,371
I merely said
I liked college football

394
00:19:50,372 --> 00:19:51,966
better than professional,

395
00:19:51,968 --> 00:19:53,798
and he called me an idiot
and began to chew me out.

396
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:56,572
So it's your turn today.
Teresa got it yesterday.

397
00:19:56,573 --> 00:19:58,773
And I'll probably
get it tomorrow.

398
00:19:58,775 --> 00:20:00,775
You can have my doghouse now.

399
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:03,177
Well, thank you, Teresa.
I figured I'd get it.

400
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:05,747
He doesn't work anyone harder
than he works himself.

401
00:20:05,748 --> 00:20:07,448
He's still the first one
and the last one...

402
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,590
Barney!
Yes, sir!

403
00:20:12,655 --> 00:20:14,485
What do you think
this is, a weekly?

404
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:15,931
Sorry, sir.

405
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:25,936
What's this?

406
00:20:27,537 --> 00:20:30,207
"'The future belongs
to the educated man, '

407
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,106
"Dr. Martin Edwards,
president of Tipps College

408
00:20:33,109 --> 00:20:35,109
said today at a meeting
of the board of..."

409
00:20:35,111 --> 00:20:37,011
It's just routine, Jim.

410
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:40,320
A handout from the university
association. We always run them.

411
00:20:40,321 --> 00:20:42,676
I know we always.
And we're gonna stop it.

412
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:44,515
If they got something to sell,
let them take an ad.

413
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:46,691
No more of these
free-ride college items

414
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:49,029
unless I clear them personally.

415
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,586
There's a "please use" on it.

416
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:54,234
"Please use"
doesn't work here anymore.

417
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,937
And those night schools.

418
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:04,506
There's a nice little racket.

419
00:21:04,507 --> 00:21:06,107
Some dame standing up there

420
00:21:06,108 --> 00:21:08,908
never been closer to a paper
than putting in a want ad,

421
00:21:08,911 --> 00:21:10,751
telling them
how to be journalists.

422
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:12,807
Stealing their money.

423
00:21:12,815 --> 00:21:16,615
Amateurs teaching amateurs
how to be amateurs.

424
00:21:16,619 --> 00:21:18,019
Mr. Gannon?

425
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:28,232
Later.

426
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:35,298
And another thing,
I don't wanna look at

427
00:21:35,304 --> 00:21:37,973
that Phi Beta Kappa's puss
around here any longer.

428
00:21:37,974 --> 00:21:39,444
Put him on the night side.

429
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:41,181
Okay, Jim.

430
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:44,079
One of these days,

431
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,880
somebody ought to go down
there and show 'em up.

432
00:21:45,882 --> 00:21:47,682
Let those poor jokers see

433
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:50,024
what a phony-baloney
the whole thing is.

434
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:53,890
Walk right in
that classroom and...

435
00:22:01,831 --> 00:22:03,331
And then, of course,
in this sentence

436
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:04,602
whom do you mean by "he"?

437
00:22:04,603 --> 00:22:06,031
The grocer.

438
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:07,495
That's not clear, Mr. APPINO.

439
00:22:07,503 --> 00:22:09,137
It could mean the boy.

440
00:22:09,138 --> 00:22:10,768
You see,
when writing news articles,

441
00:22:10,773 --> 00:22:12,643
you must be careful
about pronouns

442
00:22:12,644 --> 00:22:15,911
so as not to confuse the reader.

443
00:22:15,912 --> 00:22:17,850
Uh, would someone
turn the lights on please?

444
00:22:17,851 --> 00:22:19,877
- I'll do it.
- Thank you.

445
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,918
We'll have a little breather

446
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:25,289
while Miss Fuller gets us ready
for the second feature.

447
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:34,755
By the way, is, uh,
anyone absent tonight?

448
00:22:34,764 --> 00:22:36,564
No. Just that fella
with the moustache.

449
00:22:36,565 --> 00:22:38,025
I wonder what...

450
00:22:38,034 --> 00:22:39,774
We don't even have
an enrollment card for him.

451
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,536
We don't?

452
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:44,237
That's odd.

453
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,010
He must have been
in the wrong classroom.

454
00:22:47,011 --> 00:22:49,778
Uh, may I have
your attention, please?

455
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,879
Before we go on,
I just want to say that

456
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:54,281
for a first try,
your pieces aren't bad at all.

457
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:57,385
As a matter of fact,
I'm proud of you.

458
00:22:57,386 --> 00:22:59,955
Certainly, they're not as bad
as I make them seem

459
00:22:59,956 --> 00:23:01,756
standing up here
taking potshots at them.

460
00:23:01,758 --> 00:23:03,758
However, on the other hand,

461
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,660
you're not quite ready
for The New York Times.

462
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:08,966
Now, if I seem to be...

463
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,740
Sorry I'm late, professor.

464
00:23:14,637 --> 00:23:17,237
That's all right.

465
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:20,008
If you don't make a habit of it.

466
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:22,339
Uh, if I seem to be
rushing things a bit,

467
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,913
it's only because I believe
in learning by doing.

468
00:23:24,914 --> 00:23:27,749
You see, by writing and studying

469
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,550
your news stories,

470
00:23:29,551 --> 00:23:31,621
you'll see the importance
of some fundamental rules.

471
00:23:31,622 --> 00:23:34,520
The first one being...

472
00:23:34,523 --> 00:23:36,623
Well, Kipling said it quite well
in a poem that he wrote:

473
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,255
"I keep six honest serving men,

474
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:41,531
they taught me
all I knew. Their..."

475
00:23:41,532 --> 00:23:43,260
What and why

476
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:46,265
and when and how
and where and who."

477
00:23:48,805 --> 00:23:50,235
That's right.

478
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,509
But it wasn't Kipling.
It was Emerson.

479
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,977
Um, no, Kipling, I believe...

480
00:23:53,978 --> 00:23:56,236
Want me to look it up?
Whoever it was,

481
00:23:56,245 --> 00:23:58,145
the thought is what's important,
wouldn't you say?

482
00:23:58,147 --> 00:23:59,717
And the thought
to always remember

483
00:23:59,718 --> 00:24:01,476
is that every news
article should...

484
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:05,320
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to sound so curt, Mr...

485
00:24:05,321 --> 00:24:06,521
What is your name?

486
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:09,057
Uh, Ga... Gallagher.

487
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:12,158
It's just that our time
is so limited here and...

488
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,961
That's all right.
I only thought... Never mind.

489
00:24:14,964 --> 00:24:17,104
No, no.
No, please. Say it.

490
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,000
Well, I don't know much
about newspapers,

491
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,302
but I always had the idea

492
00:24:21,303 --> 00:24:22,973
that getting the right name
on a quote

493
00:24:22,974 --> 00:24:24,472
was considered
kind of important.

494
00:24:24,473 --> 00:24:26,173
Yes, by all means.

495
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,535
This class is supposed to be run
like a real newspaper, isn't it?

496
00:24:28,544 --> 00:24:31,054
You're quite right. You see,
in a class of journalism,

497
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:34,615
accuracy is equally as important
as punctuality.

498
00:24:34,616 --> 00:24:36,376
It was the cross-town traffic.

499
00:24:36,385 --> 00:24:38,645
And the... And the point
that we're making in passing

500
00:24:38,654 --> 00:24:40,360
is well worth emphasizing.

501
00:24:40,361 --> 00:24:42,786
Um, a prominent editor
was once asked

502
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,992
what were
the three most important things

503
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:46,634
to remember
about newspaper work.

504
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:47,928
And he said...

505
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,900
"Accuracy,
accuracy, and accuracy."

506
00:24:52,935 --> 00:24:54,965
It was Joseph Pulitzer.

507
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,880
Mr. Gallagher,
are you enrolled in this class?

508
00:25:00,881 --> 00:25:02,237
Enrolled?

509
00:25:02,244 --> 00:25:05,346
We couldn't find a card for you.

510
00:25:05,347 --> 00:25:06,547
No, I didn't know.

511
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:08,248
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher,

512
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:11,250
but you see this class is
restricted to enrolled students.

513
00:25:11,253 --> 00:25:13,153
Of course, if you, uh,
care to register,

514
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:15,315
you can always make arrangements
at the office.

515
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:28,836
Excuse me.

516
00:25:33,709 --> 00:25:35,479
Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

517
00:25:39,715 --> 00:25:44,215
CORY In paragraph five she
says, "Many of the customers."

518
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,720
shouldn't she identify them?

519
00:25:45,721 --> 00:25:47,359
- You mean here?
- Yes.

520
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,956
Uh, yes, that's right. As I
mentioned before, Miss Gross,

521
00:25:49,959 --> 00:25:52,429
whenever possible,
give the names.

522
00:25:54,663 --> 00:25:56,803
All right. Lights, please.

523
00:25:58,234 --> 00:25:59,801
My card.

524
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,338
Oh.

525
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:14,124
Yes, well... Um...

526
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:19,123
Uh...

527
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:22,858
What do I do now?

528
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:24,459
Uh, yes, well, um...

529
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,060
Uh, I'm not quite sure
what to do with you.

530
00:26:27,063 --> 00:26:30,498
Um, you see, everyone's
written a news article.

531
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:32,399
Maybe you could
listen to the criticisms.

532
00:26:32,401 --> 00:26:34,071
Couldn't I try writing one?

533
00:26:34,072 --> 00:26:35,739
Oh, well, no,
that wouldn't be fair.

534
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,306
You see, you haven't had
the benefit of any discussions...

535
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:40,876
I read papers all the time.
It doesn't look so hard.

536
00:26:40,877 --> 00:26:42,837
Oh, you're mistaken,
Mr. Gallagher.

537
00:26:42,845 --> 00:26:44,145
Good newspaper writing

538
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,106
is a highly
specialized technique.

539
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,845
Oh, let me take a whack at it.

540
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,350
You can't kill a fellow
for trying.

541
00:26:55,557 --> 00:26:57,425
All right.

542
00:26:57,426 --> 00:26:59,526
Here are the salient facts
about a recent piece of news.

543
00:26:59,528 --> 00:27:02,128
I would like you
to write 250 words or so.

544
00:27:02,131 --> 00:27:04,731
You can use that desk
in the rear, if you will.

545
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,471
Oh, by the way, do you type?

546
00:27:06,472 --> 00:27:07,598
Well, you know...

547
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:11,205
Well, there's no rush.

548
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:12,837
If you don't finish tonight,

549
00:27:12,841 --> 00:27:15,010
you can always work on it
over the weekend.

550
00:27:15,011 --> 00:27:16,481
Fair enough.

551
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:21,251
"Doesn't look so hard"?

552
00:27:21,252 --> 00:27:22,850
Get a load of him.

553
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:40,337
I don't mean to criticize

554
00:27:40,338 --> 00:27:43,266
because his story
was so much better than mine,

555
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:45,442
but, uh, but don't you
think the first part is, uh,

556
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:47,110
too long getting to the point?

557
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:48,809
Yes, that's right, Mr. APPINO.

558
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,010
Do you understand that,
Mr. Cory?

559
00:27:50,012 --> 00:27:51,446
Yes, I do.

560
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:53,507
Well, let's just sum it up
by saying that...

561
00:27:53,515 --> 00:27:55,915
That the reader's interest
must always be captured

562
00:27:55,918 --> 00:27:57,918
as soon as possible in the lead.

563
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,660
Uh, Mr. Gallagher, I'm afraid
you misunderstood me.

564
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:02,156
I said 250 words.

565
00:28:02,158 --> 00:28:04,926
I said it all in 150.
Is that bad?

566
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:06,127
No, but...

567
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:07,497
Well, you know what they say:

568
00:28:07,498 --> 00:28:09,756
"News writing
is literature in a hurry."

569
00:28:09,765 --> 00:28:11,165
Uh, five minutes?

570
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,437
I'm not used to the machine.

571
00:28:15,204 --> 00:28:18,473
Mr. Gallagher, you're not taking
this work very seriously.

572
00:28:18,474 --> 00:28:20,314
You can't have
given it much thought.

573
00:28:20,315 --> 00:28:22,839
Well, I did the best I could.

574
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:24,612
Sit down, please.

575
00:28:24,613 --> 00:28:26,083
Yes, ma'am.

576
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:37,590
I think we'll read
Mr. Gallagher's article next.

577
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:43,325
I'm not sure I can read it
as fast as he wrote it, but...

578
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:49,265
"A trigger-happy teenager
bent on robbery

579
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,771
"shot Jerome Heffner, 62,
at 5:30 p.m. yesterday

580
00:28:51,773 --> 00:28:54,212
"and left him bleeding to death
on the sidewalk

581
00:28:54,213 --> 00:28:55,840
"in front of his grocery store

582
00:28:55,844 --> 00:28:58,514
"at 286 East 110 Street.

583
00:29:06,622 --> 00:29:09,022
"Within minutes
after the shooting,

584
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,955
"Rosario Salas, 17, was captured

585
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,498
"in an alley behind the store
and brought to Heffner's side.

586
00:29:14,499 --> 00:29:17,665
"'That's the one, ' cried
Heffner, pointing at Salas.

587
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:21,336
"Heffner had been robbed twice
before in the past 18 months.

588
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,037
"'I just couldn't
take it no more, '

589
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,308
The dying grocer told Sgt. Dan
O'Rourke of the homicide squad.

590
00:29:27,309 --> 00:29:29,079
"'When this crazy kid
waves his gun at me

591
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,808
"'and says to give him my money,

592
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:34,322
"I just threw the dollar bills
right in his face.'

593
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:40,491
"The young assailant
is the oldest of nine children

594
00:29:40,492 --> 00:29:43,689
"of widowed Mrs. Hermonita
Salas, 623 Cerdo Street.

595
00:29:43,692 --> 00:29:46,361
"He was held
for investigation of murder.

596
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:49,832
"'I didn't mean to hurt nobody, '
Salas told Sgt. O'Rourke,

597
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:53,368
"'But when he threw
the money at me, I don't know,

598
00:29:53,369 --> 00:29:57,038
"'people been throwing things
in my face all my life.

599
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,209
I guess I couldn't take it
no more.'"

600
00:30:09,718 --> 00:30:12,787
I think Mr. Gallagher
deserves an apology.

601
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:16,358
I accused him of not being
serious, and I was wrong.

602
00:30:19,161 --> 00:30:21,929
This is a remarkable
first effort.

603
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,960
In fact,
Mr. Gallagher has written

604
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:27,235
one of the best news articles
I've ever had in my class.

605
00:30:28,837 --> 00:30:31,767
This piece covers everything
that I've been talking about.

606
00:30:31,773 --> 00:30:34,209
Not only does
Mr. Gallagher answer

607
00:30:34,210 --> 00:30:36,340
the what, when, where,
who, why, and how,

608
00:30:36,345 --> 00:30:38,675
he puts them in such a sequence

609
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,218
that a routine news item

610
00:30:40,219 --> 00:30:42,976
takes on all of the impact
of a short short story.

611
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:44,354
Now, let us look for a moment

612
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:47,388
at how Mr. Gallagher
constructed his story.

613
00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,059
In journalism,
there are two basic patterns...

614
00:30:53,362 --> 00:30:55,232
Boy, I wish
I could write like that.

615
00:30:55,233 --> 00:30:57,231
It really had impact.
It was excellent.

616
00:30:57,233 --> 00:30:58,733
Without labeling it,

617
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:00,344
you pointed out the entire
minority problem.

618
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:02,096
Just great, man. Great.

619
00:31:02,104 --> 00:31:03,504
I was just lucky, I guess.

620
00:31:03,505 --> 00:31:04,965
See you the next time, boy.

621
00:31:04,973 --> 00:31:07,383
Wonderful.
Good night.

622
00:31:27,062 --> 00:31:29,802
Uh, excuse me. I was just
wondering if I left a book here.

623
00:31:29,803 --> 00:31:31,228
But I guess not.

624
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:33,303
I'm glad you came back,
Mr. Gallagher. I was...

625
00:31:33,304 --> 00:31:35,136
Do you have a moment?

626
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:36,767
Certainly.

627
00:31:36,772 --> 00:31:38,812
Well, I've just been reading
your story again and it's...

628
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,407
It's absolutely amazing to think

629
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:43,478
you've had no experience.

630
00:31:43,479 --> 00:31:45,609
Well, I sold papers as a kid

631
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:47,920
and, oh, I play poker every
week with a friend of mine,

632
00:31:47,921 --> 00:31:49,416
a reporter. That's all.

633
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,188
Well, it's just excellent.

634
00:31:53,189 --> 00:31:55,089
Oh, but there is one thing,
Mr. Gallagher.

635
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:56,659
In the future, use triple space.

636
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,328
That's the way
they do it on newspapers.

637
00:31:58,329 --> 00:32:00,357
Oh, they do?
Oh, yes.

638
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:02,562
Thanks, I'll remember.

639
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,704
And, of course,
phrases like "trigger-happy"

640
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:06,066
are a bit hackneyed,

641
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:09,267
but we'll get rid
of those clichés, won't we?

642
00:32:09,271 --> 00:32:11,011
Now, what business are you in?

643
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,336
Uh, paper. Uh, wallpaper.

644
00:32:16,011 --> 00:32:17,545
Wallpaper.

645
00:32:17,546 --> 00:32:20,176
And why are you
taking this course?

646
00:32:20,182 --> 00:32:22,682
In other words,
just what are you after?

647
00:32:22,684 --> 00:32:27,422
Uh, well, that's pretty hard
to put into words.

648
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,889
To tell you the truth,

649
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,560
I didn't want to come
here in the first place.

650
00:32:30,561 --> 00:32:32,589
My boss forced me to do it.

651
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:35,596
See, he's planning on getting
out a weekly down at the plant.

652
00:32:35,597 --> 00:32:37,157
You know,
"Dottie Sprink from Shipping

653
00:32:37,165 --> 00:32:38,765
"and Harry Harper from Legal

654
00:32:38,767 --> 00:32:40,337
have decided to tie the knot."

655
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:42,466
That sort of drivel.

656
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:44,471
Oh.

657
00:32:45,707 --> 00:32:48,437
Well, naturally
I was hoping that...

658
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,849
You mean, you're
really not interested in...

659
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:54,177
Oh, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

660
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,750
But, uh, I must admit

661
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:58,551
I was pretty teed off
the first time I came here.

662
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:00,988
My friend, the reporter,

663
00:33:00,989 --> 00:33:03,519
uh, he said that you'd be
a frustrated old biddy

664
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:06,385
who'd read the textbooks
and never written a line.

665
00:33:06,395 --> 00:33:08,125
And taking a course
from someone like that

666
00:33:08,129 --> 00:33:10,498
would be like betting on a
three-legged horse, he said.

667
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:12,069
Uh, then you must've agreed
with that letter

668
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,667
of Mr. Gannon's that I read.

669
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:15,539
Oh, no, no, no. I wouldn't go
as far as he, but,

670
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,805
you know, you were
pretty rough on him,

671
00:33:17,806 --> 00:33:19,506
awfully rough,
and I don't think he meant...

672
00:33:19,508 --> 00:33:21,608
Rough?

673
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,780
I should have been a lot
rougher. Why, I've never heard...

674
00:33:23,781 --> 00:33:25,909
Well, he's no bum, you know.

675
00:33:25,914 --> 00:33:28,421
He's pretty well thought of.
My friend, the reporter,

676
00:33:28,422 --> 00:33:29,817
he says he's one of the best...

677
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:31,748
But he still
considers journalism a trade.

678
00:33:31,753 --> 00:33:34,455
It's not a trade, Mr. Gallagher.
It's a profession.

679
00:33:34,456 --> 00:33:36,056
And the basic fundamentals
can be taught

680
00:33:36,057 --> 00:33:37,287
the same as in medicine.

681
00:33:37,293 --> 00:33:40,227
But Mr. Gannon
doesn't agree. Oh, no!

682
00:33:40,228 --> 00:33:43,628
He'd like to see surgeons
operating at the age of 10

683
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:45,332
and learn by trial and error.

684
00:33:45,334 --> 00:33:46,767
Now wait a minute.

685
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:48,768
I'm sure he thought
you had a lot of fakers here

686
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,440
but if he could talk
to you for five minutes...

687
00:33:50,441 --> 00:33:52,039
I won't waste my time.

688
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,170
He'd know that you had real
newspaper experience.

689
00:33:54,175 --> 00:33:55,735
Of course, I've had experience,

690
00:33:55,744 --> 00:33:57,778
and so has every instructor
in this school!

691
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:59,409
Now wait a minute,
you don't have to sell me.

692
00:33:59,415 --> 00:34:01,475
After last week...
Oh, I'm sorry.

693
00:34:01,483 --> 00:34:03,821
I shouldn't have gotten so
angry. Forgive me.

694
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:05,749
It's just that...
Oh, that's all right.

695
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:08,094
But, you know, there's one thing
I can't quite figure.

696
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:09,719
What?

697
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:12,985
How could you give up a real
newspaper job for teaching?

698
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:18,396
Well, that's a very good
question, Mr. Gallagher.

699
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,969
Maybe for the same reason

700
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:23,298
that occasionally a musician
wants to be a conductor.

701
00:34:23,305 --> 00:34:25,805
He wants to hear
a 100 people play music

702
00:34:25,807 --> 00:34:27,837
the way he hears it.

703
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:30,581
If I can influence
a few students

704
00:34:30,582 --> 00:34:32,679
who might some day
become reporters

705
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:35,881
and eventually editors...

706
00:34:37,453 --> 00:34:39,153
Well, I think it's worth a try.

707
00:34:39,154 --> 00:34:42,623
I have my own ideas about
what newspapers should be

708
00:34:42,624 --> 00:34:45,764
and I know they can be a great
deal better than they are.

709
00:34:47,496 --> 00:34:50,526
Oh, look at this.
Blood and sex.

710
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:55,473
Journalism is so much more
than blood and sex.

711
00:34:55,474 --> 00:34:57,301
You liked my story
about that murder.

712
00:34:57,305 --> 00:34:59,105
That's "blood," isn't it?

713
00:34:59,107 --> 00:35:01,837
I didn't say I disapprove of
blood, it's just that...

714
00:35:01,843 --> 00:35:03,481
How do you feel about sex?

715
00:35:03,482 --> 00:35:05,479
Well, I'm all for it.
But some...

716
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:14,087
Good night, Mr. Gallagher.

717
00:35:16,124 --> 00:35:18,034
Good night, professor.

718
00:35:33,709 --> 00:35:34,909
What?

719
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:37,210
No! No, no, no,
I am listening.

720
00:35:37,212 --> 00:35:40,012
Repeat that address again.

721
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:43,515
Uh, 9795th Avenue.

722
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:44,889
Who's free?

723
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,020
GARTNER.

724
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:51,725
Um...

725
00:35:51,727 --> 00:35:53,187
GARTNER.

726
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,862
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

727
00:35:54,863 --> 00:35:56,333
I'll shoot someone over
right away.

728
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:57,631
Yeah?

729
00:35:57,633 --> 00:35:59,003
I almost forgot.
Press conference.

730
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,770
Got some visiting fireman
from Russia.

731
00:36:00,771 --> 00:36:02,899
Grab a cameraman. I told them
we'd be right over.

732
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,114
Okay.

733
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:09,406
What's the matter?

734
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:12,381
Well, that's one way
to end the Cold War.

735
00:36:32,167 --> 00:36:33,567
How's this?

736
00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:35,469
Fine.
I'll give you the name...

737
00:36:35,471 --> 00:36:37,638
Yup. Yeah.

738
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:39,369
This is the Chronicle.

739
00:36:39,374 --> 00:36:41,809
You have
a Professor Stone there.

740
00:36:41,810 --> 00:36:45,480
All right, instructor.
Initials E.R.

741
00:36:45,481 --> 00:36:48,449
Uh, what's the first name,
please?

742
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:49,780
Erica.

743
00:36:49,785 --> 00:36:51,885
Mmm. Uh, married or single?

744
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:54,755
Good. I mean, uh,

745
00:36:54,756 --> 00:36:56,586
switch me over there,
will you, please?

746
00:36:59,561 --> 00:37:03,397
Miss Stone's office.
Who's calling?

747
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:05,265
Who?

748
00:37:05,266 --> 00:37:06,796
Well, I, uh...

749
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:10,169
Uh, just one moment, please.

750
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:16,806
It's James Gannon
of the Chronicle.

751
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:18,112
He's here?

752
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:19,953
On the phone. He says
can he drop by tonight?

753
00:37:19,954 --> 00:37:22,078
There's something
he'd like to explain.

754
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:24,853
Tell him to write me
another letter.

755
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:32,526
Hello?

756
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:34,728
Write another letter.

757
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,930
Hello! Hello!

758
00:37:40,201 --> 00:37:41,569
All right, doll,

759
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,710
if that's the only way
you'll play.

760
00:38:06,027 --> 00:38:07,487
Oh, Mr. Gallagher.

761
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:08,925
Oh, hello.

762
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:11,200
I, uh, I want to thank you
for the lovely flowers.

763
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,667
It was a pleasure.

764
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,128
Well, it really wasn't
necessary, you know.

765
00:38:14,135 --> 00:38:16,035
Besides being wrong
about Kipling,

766
00:38:16,037 --> 00:38:18,806
I wanted to apologize for
last time. I was an awful sass.

767
00:38:18,807 --> 00:38:21,037
Oh, not at all, Mr. Gallagher.

768
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:23,180
It's, uh, very stimulating
for a teacher

769
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:25,208
to find a student
with an inquiring mind,

770
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:27,413
you know,
someone who challenges her,

771
00:38:27,415 --> 00:38:29,145
asks questions.

772
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,620
Well, uh, in that case,

773
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:33,219
there's one more question
I'd like to ask.

774
00:38:33,221 --> 00:38:36,991
What do I have to do to
get kept after school again?

775
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:38,959
Well, I was wondering if you'd

776
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,900
stay after class tonight
for a private conference?

777
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:44,096
I have a proposition
to make to you, Mr. Gallagher.

778
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,499
Hi, Gallagher.
How's it goin'?

779
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:48,201
Fine.

780
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,275
Miss Stone's office.

781
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:56,836
Hello.

782
00:38:56,845 --> 00:39:00,405
She has someone in conference,
Dr. Pine, but I'll buzz.

783
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:02,075
Oh, no, I'm sure she won't mind.

784
00:39:06,354 --> 00:39:08,624
No, that's all right.

785
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:17,562
You think
you can get the tickets?

786
00:39:17,565 --> 00:39:19,995
Well, if you can, I'd love it.

787
00:39:20,001 --> 00:39:21,568
What?

788
00:39:26,341 --> 00:39:27,681
Yes, call me back, will you?

789
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:32,605
I'm sorry. He's very amusing.

790
00:39:32,614 --> 00:39:35,883
Now, Mr. Gallagher,
I think I mentioned to you

791
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:38,454
that the dean was greatly
impressed with your news story.

792
00:39:38,455 --> 00:39:41,123
And he believes that anyone
with your natural ability

793
00:39:41,124 --> 00:39:44,662
should be allowed the privilege
of taking on extra work.

794
00:39:44,663 --> 00:39:46,360
That's the proposition?

795
00:39:46,361 --> 00:39:49,261
Yes. Think of it.
Well, it's a chance for you

796
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:51,502
to practically cover
two semesters in one.

797
00:39:51,503 --> 00:39:52,829
No, no, no, I don't...

798
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:54,174
You'd have to have
private instruction.

799
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:56,239
Oh, I'd work
very closely with you.

800
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,267
Well, in that case...

801
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:01,613
Um, do you have any free time
during the day?

802
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:07,279
No, I am afraid we'd have to
work together at night.

803
00:40:08,516 --> 00:40:10,216
All right.
On your way out,

804
00:40:10,218 --> 00:40:12,787
Miss Fuller can set up an
appointment schedule for you.

805
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:14,618
Now, let's see...

806
00:40:15,991 --> 00:40:18,591
What sort of thing would you
like to tackle next?

807
00:40:18,593 --> 00:40:20,260
Well, I...

808
00:40:20,261 --> 00:40:23,230
I want you to get the feel
of investigative reporting.

809
00:40:23,231 --> 00:40:27,001
To learn to root out
the hidden reasons and facts.

810
00:40:27,002 --> 00:40:29,469
Expand that piece you wrote.

811
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,870
Do an interpretative follow-up
of about 2,000 words.

812
00:40:32,874 --> 00:40:35,644
Two thousand? That's an awful
lot of work.

813
00:40:35,645 --> 00:40:37,745
Isn't it?
Yes, it is.

814
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:39,076
But as my father used to say,

815
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,280
"A reporter has to do
a lot of sweating,

816
00:40:41,282 --> 00:40:42,952
before he earns
the right to perspire."

817
00:40:42,953 --> 00:40:45,591
You keep mentioning
your father. What did he do?

818
00:40:45,592 --> 00:40:48,055
He ran a country newspaper.

819
00:40:48,056 --> 00:40:50,456
Well, of course, I don't know
much about this sort of thing,

820
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:53,258
but my friend I told you about,
you know, the reporter?

821
00:40:53,261 --> 00:40:55,301
He says nobody's interested
in a rehash like this.

822
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,256
After all,
it happened a week ago.

823
00:40:57,265 --> 00:40:59,465
Doing another story
on it would be like, uh,

824
00:40:59,467 --> 00:41:01,467
trying to make a salad
out of old lettuce.

825
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:05,239
Uh, excuse me for
saying this, Mr. Gallagher,

826
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,770
but your friend's
kind of reporting

827
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:08,275
went out with Prohibition.

828
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,411
This isn't a rehash.

829
00:41:12,413 --> 00:41:16,550
I'm talking about
the big why behind the story.

830
00:41:16,551 --> 00:41:19,689
This is the function of a
newspaper in today's world.

831
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,956
While TV and radio
announce spot news

832
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:23,617
minutes after it happens.

833
00:41:23,624 --> 00:41:25,464
Newspapers can't compete
in reporting

834
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:27,127
what happened any more.

835
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:29,868
But they can and should tell
the public why it happened.

836
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:34,573
What made your story
so interesting?

837
00:41:34,574 --> 00:41:39,669
I'll tell you. It was Salas'
reason for firing the gun.

838
00:41:39,674 --> 00:41:42,109
Listen to this.

839
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,848
"When he threw
the money at me, I don't know,

840
00:41:44,849 --> 00:41:47,706
"people been throwing things
in my face all my life.

841
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,645
I guess I couldn't
take it no more."

842
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:52,089
But he said it on the spot.
It tied in with the story!

843
00:41:52,090 --> 00:41:55,157
Young Salas gave a vague,
bitter, tormented reason.

844
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:58,956
But behind that
why are a hundred other whys.

845
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,396
One on top of another,
they led to violence.

846
00:42:02,397 --> 00:42:05,297
Was it because he's a member
of a minority group

847
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:08,740
struggling to solve the complex
problem of assimilation?

848
00:42:08,741 --> 00:42:11,005
Did society at large

849
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,906
create the climate
for this tragedy?

850
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,008
Mr. Gallagher,
out there in the city

851
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:17,410
are some of the answers.

852
00:42:17,412 --> 00:42:20,480
Files of
the immigration department,

853
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:23,350
dark shadows of Central Park,

854
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:24,985
tenements,

855
00:42:24,986 --> 00:42:26,546
overcrowded schools,

856
00:42:26,554 --> 00:42:29,024
the jails, the police stations.

857
00:42:30,892 --> 00:42:32,362
And it's your job
to try to find them.

858
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,460
You know, that's the kind
of thing you read

859
00:42:34,462 --> 00:42:36,102
when you're waiting
in a dentist's office.

860
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:37,927
The guy who fights his way
on a subway

861
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:39,733
every night
after a hard day's work,

862
00:42:39,734 --> 00:42:41,572
hangs onto a strap with one hand

863
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:42,999
and a newspaper with the other,

864
00:42:43,004 --> 00:42:44,504
doesn't want to wade through
a dull explanation...

865
00:42:44,505 --> 00:42:46,535
The man on the subway is a lot
more curious than you think.

866
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,508
You ask anybody

867
00:42:48,509 --> 00:42:50,679
except that outdated
reporter friend of yours,

868
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,508
and you'll find that today the
average man wants to know why.

869
00:42:54,515 --> 00:42:57,785
Please, Mr. Gallagher,
won't you try writing it?

870
00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:02,957
All right.

871
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:04,418
But couldn't we go someplace

872
00:43:04,425 --> 00:43:06,155
and have a cup of coffee
and talk it over?

873
00:43:06,161 --> 00:43:08,261
No, thank you. I've, uh,
got to get home.

874
00:43:08,263 --> 00:43:09,963
I have a lot of reading and...

875
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,365
Only take a few minutes.

876
00:43:11,366 --> 00:43:13,166
Maybe you could show me
how to start.

877
00:43:13,168 --> 00:43:14,938
No, no, no. This is what's
called in the trade

878
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:17,836
a think piece
and I want your thinking.

879
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,739
I know you've... Excuse me.

880
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:21,976
Hello.

881
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,337
You got the tickets.
Well, that's wonderful.

882
00:43:24,345 --> 00:43:26,745
They were sold out
weeks ago, I thought.

883
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:28,715
You know, you're fantastic.

884
00:43:28,716 --> 00:43:30,716
What?

885
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:35,618
That's lovely. Yes.

886
00:43:35,623 --> 00:43:37,063
Hold on a second, will you?

887
00:43:37,064 --> 00:43:40,498
Good night, Mr. Gallagher,
and good luck.

888
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,696
Yes.

889
00:43:43,698 --> 00:43:45,968
What time shall I expect you?

890
00:43:46,902 --> 00:43:48,335
Good night.

891
00:43:48,336 --> 00:43:49,966
Good night.

892
00:43:49,971 --> 00:43:51,771
Well, I just think it's great.

893
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:54,875
You're supposed to put me down
for an evening conference.

894
00:43:54,876 --> 00:43:56,536
Tomorrow night
would be, uh, good for me.

895
00:43:56,544 --> 00:44:00,847
Let's see. No. Tomorrow night,
Dr. Pine.

896
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:03,017
Saturday night, Dr. Pine.

897
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:06,618
What's with this Dr. Pine.
Doesn't she feel well?

898
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,256
You're Tuesday at 9:30.

899
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:11,187
Seven would be better for me.

900
00:44:11,192 --> 00:44:13,732
Perhaps we could have dinner
together, you know and...

901
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:16,998
Nine-thirty.

902
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:21,835
Concert, Dr. Pine,
Tuesday. I'll put it down.

903
00:44:21,836 --> 00:44:23,796
Yes, I'll be right in.

904
00:44:23,804 --> 00:44:26,314
You're now Wednesday at 9:30.

905
00:44:36,851 --> 00:44:39,491
Here's the advance
Jim Bacon AP story.

906
00:44:40,688 --> 00:44:43,057
Drama.

907
00:44:43,058 --> 00:44:45,188
Sorry, Jim,
haven't got a quarter.

908
00:44:45,193 --> 00:44:47,962
Broke even tonight,
didn't play. Anything?

909
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:49,563
Nothing much.

910
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:52,004
They found a homemade bomb
in a locker at Grand Central.

911
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:53,267
No damage.

912
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:54,668
Must be that same screwball.

913
00:44:54,669 --> 00:44:58,169
Tell me, why does a guy
do a thing like that?

914
00:44:58,173 --> 00:45:00,311
What difference
does it make? He did it.

915
00:45:00,312 --> 00:45:02,278
Uh, give me some coffee, please.

916
00:45:02,279 --> 00:45:03,837
There's got to be a reason.

917
00:45:03,844 --> 00:45:07,384
I keep sayin' to myself,
"Why, why?"

918
00:45:17,292 --> 00:45:19,326
I, uh, need some stuff, Bill,

919
00:45:19,327 --> 00:45:21,097
on the local
Puerto Rican situation.

920
00:45:21,098 --> 00:45:22,626
Want me to check the clips?

921
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:24,730
No, no, no. I know what
we've got in the morgue.

922
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:26,632
I need more intimate stuff:

923
00:45:26,634 --> 00:45:29,069
Census figures on family income,

924
00:45:29,070 --> 00:45:31,305
housing, employment,

925
00:45:31,306 --> 00:45:33,136
uh, survey on prejudice,

926
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:35,075
uh, police, uh, statistics...

927
00:45:35,076 --> 00:45:37,176
You mean like for a think piece?

928
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:40,708
Yeah, like for a think piece.

929
00:45:40,715 --> 00:45:42,515
I doubt if we have
anything up-to-date

930
00:45:42,517 --> 00:45:44,377
enough for that.
We never use it.

931
00:45:44,385 --> 00:45:46,485
I can round up
something tomorrow if you...

932
00:45:46,487 --> 00:45:48,787
I wanted it tonight.

933
00:45:48,789 --> 00:45:50,819
Why?

934
00:45:50,825 --> 00:45:53,855
I'm going to school.
I need it for my homework.

935
00:45:53,861 --> 00:45:58,031
You ask a silly question,
you get a silly answer.

936
00:45:58,033 --> 00:45:59,503
Yeah.

937
00:46:01,202 --> 00:46:03,070
Mr. Gannon?

938
00:46:03,071 --> 00:46:04,401
Beg your pardon, Mr. Gannon,

939
00:46:04,405 --> 00:46:06,905
but I couldn't help
overhearing...

940
00:46:06,907 --> 00:46:08,275
Well?

941
00:46:08,276 --> 00:46:10,606
I think I might have
what you're looking for.

942
00:46:10,611 --> 00:46:11,945
Where?

943
00:46:11,946 --> 00:46:13,746
Right here in my desk, sir.

944
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:18,252
There's quite a bit on
that Puerto Rican situation.

945
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,723
Getting more explosive
every day.

946
00:46:19,724 --> 00:46:21,355
Got anything on that kid

947
00:46:21,356 --> 00:46:23,156
that killed the grocer at 110th
Street about a week ago?

948
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:25,228
The Salas boy.
Yes, sir.

949
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:31,570
Uh, give me a think piece,

950
00:46:31,571 --> 00:46:34,266
about 2,000 words
on the factors and conditions

951
00:46:34,269 --> 00:46:35,799
that led to the killing.

952
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:37,537
Yes, sir.

953
00:46:37,538 --> 00:46:39,908
Soon as you get the lead
finished, let me see it.

954
00:46:39,909 --> 00:46:41,277
Yes, sir.

955
00:46:58,626 --> 00:47:02,026
I can't seem to get it out
of my mind, Mr. Gannon.

956
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:03,359
What?

957
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:06,233
Why does a guy
do a thing like that?

958
00:47:06,234 --> 00:47:08,872
Maybe he was sore
at the world, that's why.

959
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:10,299
I'm sore at the world, too,

960
00:47:10,305 --> 00:47:12,635
but I don't go around
planting bombs.

961
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,478
Let me speak to Miss Erica
Stone's office, please.

962
00:47:15,479 --> 00:47:17,406
There's got to be
a reason behind it.

963
00:47:17,412 --> 00:47:20,552
The bomb was heavy. He got tired
of carrying it around

964
00:47:20,553 --> 00:47:22,378
so he put it in the locker.

965
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:23,953
Only costs a dime, you know.

966
00:47:23,954 --> 00:47:27,551
Hello. Uh, let me speak
to Miss Erica Stone, please.

967
00:47:27,555 --> 00:47:29,815
She's gone home.

968
00:47:29,824 --> 00:47:33,062
I'm sorry, Mr. Gallagher,
I can't give you her address.

969
00:47:33,063 --> 00:47:35,060
Not without
faculty authorization.

970
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,197
But, uh, I've finished

971
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:39,298
the first paragraph
of my assignment

972
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,400
and, uh, I just wanted
to drop by her place

973
00:47:41,402 --> 00:47:42,902
for a few minutes

974
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:44,841
and, uh, see
if I was on the right track.

975
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:48,039
If you mean the inside track,
the answer is no.

976
00:47:48,042 --> 00:47:52,552
Dr. Hugo Pine is coming along
fast on that one. Good night.

977
00:48:01,722 --> 00:48:06,292
Dr. Hugo Pine.

978
00:48:17,238 --> 00:48:18,707
How's the fan mail this morning?

979
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:20,666
Fine.
I just got more for you.

980
00:48:20,675 --> 00:48:21,875
Thank you.

981
00:48:29,116 --> 00:48:30,776
Hello, Barney.
How are you this morning?

982
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:32,785
How are you, Miss Fletcher.
Fine, thank you.

983
00:48:32,787 --> 00:48:34,647
Got a lot of mail
there this morning.

984
00:48:34,655 --> 00:48:37,755
Good morning.
Good morning, Harold.

985
00:48:41,396 --> 00:48:43,126
Get me everything
you can on him.

986
00:48:44,832 --> 00:48:47,902
Dr. Hugo Pine.

987
00:48:49,470 --> 00:48:50,600
P-I-N-E?

988
00:48:50,605 --> 00:48:53,205
Right. Hurry it up,
will you, Tess?

989
00:48:53,208 --> 00:48:56,138
Here's the rest of
that Salas story.

990
00:48:56,143 --> 00:48:58,512
Take you all night?
Yes, sir.

991
00:48:58,513 --> 00:49:00,582
You should have
knocked it out faster.

992
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,420
After all, how long does it take
to say we need better housing,

993
00:49:03,421 --> 00:49:05,187
bigger playgrounds
and more schools?

994
00:49:05,188 --> 00:49:07,486
Well, I wanted
to talk to Salas' mother.

995
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:09,588
I got there early
while they were still asleep.

996
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:12,190
I wanted to find
something out. I was right.

997
00:49:12,193 --> 00:49:13,593
They were living eight
in one room.

998
00:49:13,594 --> 00:49:15,404
That's against the housing law.

999
00:49:15,405 --> 00:49:17,296
The landlord's a gouger.

1000
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:19,298
There's a $40 rent
ceiling for one room,

1001
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,270
but he takes another 40
under the table.

1002
00:49:21,271 --> 00:49:23,269
It was that 40 the boy was after

1003
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:25,211
when he killed the old man.

1004
00:49:26,807 --> 00:49:28,537
Okay.

1005
00:49:36,784 --> 00:49:38,017
What's your name?

1006
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,887
Miller. Harold Miller.

1007
00:49:40,888 --> 00:49:42,558
All right, Miller.

1008
00:49:49,430 --> 00:49:52,970
Roy, put Miller
back on the day side.

1009
00:49:54,068 --> 00:49:55,398
Okay, Jim.

1010
00:49:57,004 --> 00:49:59,773
Gannon.

1011
00:49:59,774 --> 00:50:03,112
Here's that information you
wanted on Dr. Hugo Pine.

1012
00:50:03,113 --> 00:50:04,410
"Special consultant,

1013
00:50:04,412 --> 00:50:06,212
"psychological warfare,
U.S. Army.

on state mental hospitals.

00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:10,816

00:50:10,818 --> 00:50:13,388
on juvenile delinquency.
Head of..."

1017
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,226
When did he win the Nobel Prize?

1018
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:22,396
He also writes books.

1019
00:50:22,397 --> 00:50:25,897
Yeah, I guess I could have the
bookstore send them up to you.

1020
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:28,400
Any particular ones?

1021
00:50:28,403 --> 00:50:30,370
Whatever he's written.

1022
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:32,911
Okay, I'll take care
of it right away.

1023
00:50:35,776 --> 00:50:38,706
Oh, Gladys.
Gladys, get me the bookstore.

1024
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:43,850
Thanks a lot!

1025
00:50:54,929 --> 00:50:57,259
All right.

1026
00:50:57,264 --> 00:50:58,632
What's that?

1027
00:50:58,633 --> 00:51:01,102
The books you ordered,
by Dr. Hugo Pine.

1028
00:51:01,103 --> 00:51:02,601
I said one copy of each.

1029
00:51:02,603 --> 00:51:04,103
That's what you got,
Mr. Gannon.

1030
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:07,507
And here's the bill.
$83.40.

1031
00:51:07,508 --> 00:51:08,908
Eighty-three...?

1032
00:51:18,252 --> 00:51:21,388
"The Psychoneurotic
Manifestations

1033
00:51:21,389 --> 00:51:23,859
of Abnormal Cultural Patterns."

1034
00:51:29,997 --> 00:51:30,997
Well, I...

1035
00:51:30,998 --> 00:51:33,528
Just catching up
on a little reading.

1036
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:36,269
"The Mind in
a Primitive Environment."

1037
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,100
"Symptoms and Syndromes"?

1038
00:51:38,105 --> 00:51:39,735
Yeah, like Burns and Allen.

1039
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:42,440
"The Effects of Frustration
on the American Woman."

1040
00:51:42,443 --> 00:51:44,283
That is the story of my life.

1041
00:51:44,284 --> 00:51:45,578
That I gotta read.

1042
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,010
"Formulation and..."

1043
00:51:47,014 --> 00:51:48,820
What does this guy do,
write in double talk?

1044
00:51:48,821 --> 00:51:50,616
Must have taken him
a good 60 years

1045
00:51:50,618 --> 00:51:53,186
to write all this stuff.

1046
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:55,017
Yeah!

1047
00:51:55,022 --> 00:51:56,490
Yeah, yeah.

1048
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:58,929
Yeah, with no time off
for bad behavior.

1049
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:02,426
Hey, the old boy must be about
ready to retire on his pension.

1050
00:52:02,430 --> 00:52:04,300
Hey, wait a minute.

1051
00:52:04,301 --> 00:52:06,568
Here's a picture of the guy.

1052
00:52:09,637 --> 00:52:12,837
Brother!

1053
00:52:25,252 --> 00:52:27,552
What is this?

1054
00:52:27,555 --> 00:52:30,955
Doesn't anyone do any work
around this joint any more?

1055
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:39,225
I'll read it during lunch.

1056
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:41,868
Uh, Mr. Gannon?
Yeah?

1057
00:52:41,869 --> 00:52:44,099
I was wondering if,
uh... Well, um...

1058
00:52:44,104 --> 00:52:47,344
Roy said it was all right with
him if it was all right with you

1059
00:52:47,345 --> 00:52:51,341
that, uh, I could try writing
a few obituaries.

1060
00:52:51,345 --> 00:52:53,745
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

1061
00:52:53,748 --> 00:52:56,148
And here's a great one
to start on:

1062
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,317
Dr. Hugo Pine.

1063
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:00,987
Uh, how did he die?

1064
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:02,888
I haven't decided yet.

1065
00:53:17,204 --> 00:53:20,142
What's a five-letter word
for New Zealand parrot?

1066
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:22,040
I know I don't have
an appointment with her

1067
00:53:22,042 --> 00:53:24,310
but I just want to see her
for a couple of minutes.

1068
00:53:24,311 --> 00:53:25,611
She's reading
the rest of your story.

1069
00:53:25,613 --> 00:53:27,113
She'll see you when she's done.

1070
00:53:27,114 --> 00:53:29,052
But I want to see her
about something else.

1071
00:53:29,053 --> 00:53:31,749
It won't take more than...

1072
00:53:38,358 --> 00:53:39,758
Oh.
Oh, sorry.

1073
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:41,227
Come in.

1074
00:53:41,228 --> 00:53:43,697
Mr. Gallagher, I'm so excited
about this piece.

1075
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:45,928
Well, thanks.
It's a brilliant job.

1076
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:49,040
I've just been comparing it
with these other stories and...

1077
00:53:49,041 --> 00:53:50,696
Well, you don't know
what it means

1078
00:53:50,705 --> 00:53:52,705
for a teacher
to find someone like you.

1079
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:54,937
Oh, it wasn't so good.
Awfully long, I thought.

1080
00:53:54,942 --> 00:53:56,676
Oh, it could stand
a little work.

1081
00:53:56,677 --> 00:53:58,207
And I'd love to sit here
with you and work on...

1082
00:53:58,212 --> 00:54:00,650
Okay, let's. Do you
mind if I take my coat...

1083
00:54:00,651 --> 00:54:02,548
No, I'm sorry I have
a dinner appointment.

1084
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:04,417
It's a friend's birthday.

1085
00:54:04,418 --> 00:54:05,648
As a matter of fact,
I'm late already.

1086
00:54:05,653 --> 00:54:07,253
But before you go,

1087
00:54:07,254 --> 00:54:08,494
I want you to make me a promise.

1088
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,956
What's that?

1089
00:54:09,957 --> 00:54:11,787
That you'll give up
the wallpaper business

1090
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,032
and really make
a stab at reporting.

1091
00:54:13,033 --> 00:54:14,757
No, no, I don't think...

1092
00:54:14,762 --> 00:54:16,862
I'll help you
in every way that I can.

1093
00:54:16,864 --> 00:54:18,870
Mr. Gallagher,
I've never before

1094
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:20,726
asked a night class
student to do this.

1095
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:23,495
I'm so sure about you.

1096
00:54:23,504 --> 00:54:25,373
Why, these pieces you wrote
are good enough

1097
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:28,010
to be printed in any paper in
this town. Really they are.

1098
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:29,638
Before I take a step like that,

1099
00:54:29,644 --> 00:54:31,782
shouldn't I
prepare myself a little more?

1100
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:34,079
I didn't mean tomorrow.
Take some other subjects?

1101
00:54:34,081 --> 00:54:36,550
Of course.
English. History is valuable.

1102
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:39,018
What about, uh, psychology?

1103
00:54:39,019 --> 00:54:40,186
Excellent.

1104
00:54:40,187 --> 00:54:43,087
Any particular class or teacher?

1105
00:54:43,090 --> 00:54:45,020
Well, it's a little late
for this semester,

1106
00:54:45,025 --> 00:54:46,955
but Dr. Pine is here
at the university.

1107
00:54:46,961 --> 00:54:49,061
He's one of the most
eminent men in the country.

1108
00:54:49,063 --> 00:54:51,533
No, no, I don't get along
with eggheads like that.

1109
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:53,199
Not Hugo.
Hugo?

1110
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,930
Dr. Pine.

1111
00:54:54,935 --> 00:54:57,905
He's a delightful, unassuming,
wonderful person.

1112
00:54:58,873 --> 00:55:01,140
Yeah.
As a matter of fact,

1113
00:55:01,141 --> 00:55:02,881
he's the one I'm having
dinner with tonight.

1114
00:55:02,882 --> 00:55:04,607
I'll mention it to him.

1115
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:06,612
I'm sure there's something
that he could suggest.

1116
00:55:06,614 --> 00:55:07,881
Hmm. No doubt.

1117
00:55:07,882 --> 00:55:09,882
But, Mr. Gallagher,
you do think that

1118
00:55:09,884 --> 00:55:11,722
someday you
really might consider

1119
00:55:11,723 --> 00:55:13,419
giving up what
you've been doing?

1120
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,950
Someday?

1121
00:55:14,955 --> 00:55:16,815
I'm giving it up right now.

1122
00:55:16,824 --> 00:55:18,864
I can see I've been
wasting my time.

1123
00:55:18,865 --> 00:55:22,395
Mr. Gallagher, I'm delighted.

1124
00:55:22,396 --> 00:55:24,196
Let's shake on it.

1125
00:55:28,402 --> 00:55:30,002
Mr. Gallagher!

1126
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:34,880
So long, professor.

1127
00:56:24,358 --> 00:56:26,588
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1128
00:56:27,628 --> 00:56:29,728
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1129
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:35,170
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1130
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,240
What kind would you like, sir?

1131
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:43,041
These days a girl's gotta know

1132
00:56:43,043 --> 00:56:45,313
all about deductibles,
capital gainses,

1133
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:46,746
things like that,

1134
00:56:46,747 --> 00:56:49,047
or she can wind up
working for the government.

1135
00:56:49,049 --> 00:56:50,379
Hmm.

1136
00:56:50,384 --> 00:56:52,118
What do you think?

1137
00:56:52,119 --> 00:56:53,519
Hmm.

1138
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:55,655
Huh? What?

1139
00:56:55,656 --> 00:56:59,056
Never mind. You've been
thinking enough today.

1140
00:57:07,735 --> 00:57:09,895
Someone you know?

1141
00:57:11,271 --> 00:57:14,171
Slightly.

1142
00:57:14,174 --> 00:57:16,214
Who's the character with her?
Hmm?

1143
00:57:25,986 --> 00:57:29,286
He's dreamy.
Must be from Hollywood.

1144
00:57:31,726 --> 00:57:34,226
He's a psychologist.

1145
00:57:35,595 --> 00:57:38,425
No kidding!

1146
00:57:38,432 --> 00:57:40,072
Well, what do you know?

1147
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:45,138
It just shows you,
you can't tell by looks.

1148
00:57:57,517 --> 00:58:01,417
Jimsy, what's a psychologist?

1149
00:58:03,257 --> 00:58:05,825
A guy who gives
all kinds of advice

1150
00:58:05,826 --> 00:58:08,226
about things he knows
nothing about.

1151
00:58:30,918 --> 00:58:34,618
So he's got more degrees
than a thermometer.

1152
00:58:34,621 --> 00:58:36,421
So he speaks seven languages.

1153
00:58:36,423 --> 00:58:38,257
So he's read every book.

1154
00:58:38,258 --> 00:58:40,088
So what?

1155
00:58:40,094 --> 00:58:44,097
The important thing is
he's had no experience.

1156
00:58:44,098 --> 00:58:46,167
He didn't start at
the bottom and work up.

1157
00:58:46,168 --> 00:58:48,166
That's the only way
you can learn.

1158
00:58:48,168 --> 00:58:51,268
You're so right, Jimsy.
Take me.

1159
00:58:51,271 --> 00:58:53,971
Where would I be if
I just read books?

1160
00:59:02,282 --> 00:59:05,992
Well, I gotta go get undressed.

1161
00:59:07,788 --> 00:59:09,388
Coming over after?

1162
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:11,759
Talk to him about
anything but psychology,

1163
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,488
and I bet you
he's a dead pigeon.

1164
00:59:14,494 --> 00:59:16,996
Don't get mad at me.

1165
00:59:16,997 --> 00:59:20,397
I've got plenty of experience.

1166
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:23,736
Yeah. That's what I like
about you.

1167
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:26,005
Coming over after?

1168
00:59:26,006 --> 00:59:27,606
You got a date.

1169
01:00:12,386 --> 01:00:14,446
Just thought I'd
drop by and say,

1170
01:00:14,454 --> 01:00:15,621
"happy birthday."

1171
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:17,822
Oh, Mr. Gallagher,
how thoughtful of you.

1172
01:00:17,824 --> 01:00:19,225
This is Dr. Pine.

1173
01:00:19,226 --> 01:00:21,286
How do you do?
How do you do?

1174
01:00:21,295 --> 01:00:23,255
Mr. Gallagher's the star pupil
I was telling you about.

1175
01:00:23,263 --> 01:00:25,298
Oh, yes.
He's very advanced.

1176
01:00:25,299 --> 01:00:27,729
Won't you join us for a drink?

1177
01:00:27,734 --> 01:00:30,136
Don't mind if I do.
Scotch.

1178
01:00:30,137 --> 01:00:31,197
Erica?

1179
01:00:31,205 --> 01:00:32,705
Nothing, thanks.
I'm doing just fine.

1180
01:00:32,706 --> 01:00:33,936
Waiter.
Yes, sir?

1181
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:35,281
Two scotches.

1182
01:00:48,989 --> 01:00:51,289
Where's your friend?

1183
01:00:51,291 --> 01:00:52,858
Who?

1184
01:00:52,859 --> 01:00:54,489
Oh, you mean Miss Defore?

1185
01:00:54,494 --> 01:00:57,530
She had to go backstage.
She sings here.

1186
01:00:57,531 --> 01:00:58,898
Oh!

1187
01:00:58,899 --> 01:01:00,099
She's very pretty.

1188
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:03,200
Very talented too.
I'm sure.

1189
01:01:03,203 --> 01:01:07,513
Really a delightful,
unassuming, wonderful person.

1190
01:01:09,709 --> 01:01:13,509
Congratulations on
Symptoms and Syndromes.

1191
01:01:13,513 --> 01:01:15,083
That ought to sweep the country.

1192
01:01:15,084 --> 01:01:17,951
Have you read it?
Hasn't everyone?

1193
01:01:17,952 --> 01:01:19,618
Well, I doubt it.

1194
01:01:19,619 --> 01:01:22,989
I haven't been able to
get through it myself. Heh.

1195
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:25,860
Miss Stone mentioned
that you might be interested

1196
01:01:25,861 --> 01:01:28,329
in taking an elementary
psychology course.

1197
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:30,997
No, I changed my mind.
Just a waste of time.

1198
01:01:30,998 --> 01:01:32,865
Well, I agree with you.

1199
01:01:32,866 --> 01:01:34,196
Those lectures
can be mighty dull.

1200
01:01:34,201 --> 01:01:36,435
I know. I give them.

1201
01:01:40,975 --> 01:01:43,175
I could suggest
a course of reading for you.

1202
01:01:43,177 --> 01:01:45,077
Give you twice as much
in half the time.

1203
01:01:45,079 --> 01:01:46,609
And it'd be a pleasure for you.

1204
01:01:46,613 --> 01:01:49,453
There wouldn't be
a single book written by me.

1205
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:51,479
Cigars? Cigarettes?

1206
01:01:51,485 --> 01:01:53,915
Oh, ahem. Cheers!

1207
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:56,855
Cheers.

1208
01:01:56,856 --> 01:01:58,426
Cheers.

1209
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,097
Cigars?

1210
01:02:04,098 --> 01:02:06,067
Then he spears
this hot line drive,

1211
01:02:06,068 --> 01:02:07,566
runs over and touches second,

1212
01:02:07,567 --> 01:02:09,837
then dives over and tags
the runner sliding in.

1213
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:11,066
It was in 1921.

1214
01:02:11,071 --> 01:02:12,911
The only unassisted triple play

1215
01:02:12,912 --> 01:02:14,536
in World Series history.

1216
01:02:14,541 --> 01:02:16,081
His name was Bill, um...

1217
01:02:16,082 --> 01:02:17,576
Wambsganss.

1218
01:02:19,479 --> 01:02:20,909
Yeah.

1219
01:02:20,914 --> 01:02:23,749
Wasn't that the 1920 series?

1220
01:02:23,750 --> 01:02:25,550
'21.

1221
01:02:25,552 --> 01:02:27,522
No, no, it was the '20 series,
now that I think of it.

1222
01:02:27,523 --> 01:02:29,959
I remember reading about it.
Cleveland against the Dodgers.

1223
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,616
The Indians took five games.

1224
01:02:31,625 --> 01:02:33,925
That year they first played
a five out of nine game series.

1225
01:02:33,927 --> 01:02:37,096
Of course, they did it again
in '21, but the following year

1226
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:38,697
they went back to
best four out of seven.

1227
01:02:38,698 --> 01:02:40,228
Waiter! Round.

1228
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:50,111
We were on the bridge.
The admiral and I looked off

1229
01:02:50,112 --> 01:02:51,440
and there was a kamikaze

1230
01:02:51,445 --> 01:02:53,275
headed straight
for the Enterprise

1231
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,520
coming in low...
Isn't that a coincidence!

1232
01:02:57,684 --> 01:03:00,024
I was on
the Enterprise at the time.

1233
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:07,591
What a day.
What a day that was.

1234
01:03:07,594 --> 01:03:10,063
I remember I was topside
at that particular moment.

1235
01:03:10,064 --> 01:03:11,601
I was on duty at the time...

1236
01:03:11,602 --> 01:03:13,068
Would you like to dance?

1237
01:03:13,069 --> 01:03:14,567
Of course.
Just go right ahead.

1238
01:03:14,568 --> 01:03:16,038
Excuse us.

1239
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:30,152
It's the mambo.

1240
01:03:44,264 --> 01:03:45,598
What's the matter?

1241
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,399
Oh, it's a bit
crowded, you know.

1242
01:03:47,401 --> 01:03:48,901
It doesn't look too dangerous.

1243
01:03:48,902 --> 01:03:50,272
Where's your sense of adventure?

1244
01:03:50,273 --> 01:03:51,810
If you'll excuse us.

1245
01:05:36,476 --> 01:05:39,206
Looks like they're getting ready
to start the floor show.

1246
01:05:39,213 --> 01:05:41,713
Yeah, good.
Uh, cheers.

1247
01:05:41,715 --> 01:05:42,875
Right.

1248
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,955
Same table?
Triples yet.

1249
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:57,730
Where's he puttin' them?
Where are we gonna put him?

1250
01:05:57,731 --> 01:06:00,031
Oh, try it.
It's very simple.

1251
01:06:21,921 --> 01:06:24,121
How about you, sir?

1252
01:06:24,123 --> 01:06:25,693
Well, I'll try.

1253
01:06:29,729 --> 01:06:32,398
Aah!

1254
01:06:40,006 --> 01:06:41,506
Whoa!

1255
01:06:58,091 --> 01:06:59,761
That was
a watutsi tribal rhythm.

1256
01:06:59,762 --> 01:07:02,828
It's played at
victory celebrations.

1257
01:07:02,829 --> 01:07:04,459
To the watutsis.

1258
01:07:19,346 --> 01:07:21,606
Now a little change
from the Afro-Cuban rhythm.

1259
01:07:21,615 --> 01:07:23,745
Ladies and gentlemen,
the gal who invented

1260
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:26,550

Say, she is talented.

1288
01:09:05,218 --> 01:09:06,485
Yeah.

1289
01:09:06,486 --> 01:09:08,046
Oh, dear.
Here, let me help you.

1290
01:09:08,054 --> 01:09:09,354
I'm sorry.

1291
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:10,755
Oh, here, here.
That's all right.

1292
01:09:10,757 --> 01:09:12,557
We'll order another round.
Waiter!

1293
01:09:12,559 --> 01:09:14,789
I think we've all had enough,
Mr. Gallagher.

1294
01:09:14,794 --> 01:09:16,664
What's the matter,
can't take it?

1295
01:09:16,665 --> 01:09:18,363
Oh, it's a very strange thing.

1296
01:09:18,364 --> 01:09:19,802
I once did some research

1297
01:09:19,803 --> 01:09:21,799
on the psychological
aspects of inebriation.

1298
01:09:21,801 --> 01:09:23,301
I've developed
what you might call

1299
01:09:23,302 --> 01:09:24,742
a mental control
of liquor's effects.

1300
01:09:24,743 --> 01:09:26,638
I can drink any amount at all,

1301
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,640
and it doesn't bother me a bit.

1302
01:09:28,642 --> 01:09:31,412
Well, it doesn't bither me
a bot, either!

1303
01:09:34,481 --> 01:09:37,015
Thank you.
Thanks.

1304
01:09:37,016 --> 01:09:38,586
It's been lovely.

1305
01:09:43,189 --> 01:09:44,419
Waiter!

1306
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:55,530
Oh, you leaving too?

1307
01:09:55,535 --> 01:09:57,835
Yes. Can we give you a lift?

1308
01:09:57,837 --> 01:09:59,907
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

1309
01:10:25,599 --> 01:10:27,599
It's all right.
It's all right.

1310
01:10:28,868 --> 01:10:30,938
Can I give you a little help
with your friend?

1311
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:32,937
No. I'll manage.
Just get us a cab.

1312
01:10:32,939 --> 01:10:35,469
Yes, sir.

1313
01:10:38,411 --> 01:10:39,911
Let us give you
a lift home, old man.

1314
01:10:39,913 --> 01:10:41,613
Don't old man me, old man!

1315
01:10:41,615 --> 01:10:43,315
I'll be okay.
Of course you will.

1316
01:10:43,316 --> 01:10:44,946
All you need is a bit of oxygen.

1317
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,071
Here, just take a good, deep
breath of air. Like this.

1318
01:11:03,637 --> 01:11:06,767
Hugo, are you all right?

1319
01:11:06,773 --> 01:11:08,073
Oh!

1320
01:11:43,743 --> 01:11:45,183
May I come in?

1321
01:11:45,184 --> 01:11:46,778
Just a minute.

1322
01:11:55,188 --> 01:11:56,688
Come in.

1323
01:11:58,324 --> 01:11:59,658
Will this help?

1324
01:11:59,659 --> 01:12:01,229
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

1325
01:12:02,862 --> 01:12:04,562
For him?
Oh, nothing will help him.

1326
01:12:11,037 --> 01:12:12,967
How do you feel?

1327
01:12:12,972 --> 01:12:15,572
I never sobered up
so fast in all my life.

1328
01:12:15,575 --> 01:12:17,635
Seeing him in the gutter

1329
01:12:17,644 --> 01:12:19,712
was better than a Turkish bath.

1330
01:12:19,713 --> 01:12:22,380
Well, I never...
What happened?

1331
01:12:22,381 --> 01:12:25,121
Oxygen. It'll
do it every time.

1332
01:12:26,953 --> 01:12:30,623
Oh, dear, and he has
a 8:00 class in the morning.

1333
01:12:30,624 --> 01:12:32,994
Not tomorrow morning.

1334
01:13:01,655 --> 01:13:03,655
Why don't you cross
with the light sometime?

1335
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:06,027
You'll find it
a wonderful experience!

1336
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:10,362
You know,
you were right about Pine.

1337
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:12,665
He's quite a guy.

1338
01:13:12,666 --> 01:13:14,496
Yes, he is.

1339
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:16,900
Good at everything.
Mmm.

1340
01:13:17,971 --> 01:13:20,271
Sometimes that's quite a strain.

1341
01:13:20,273 --> 01:13:22,173
Strain?

1342
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:24,475
Yes, you keep
wanting him to miss.

1343
01:13:24,477 --> 01:13:26,945
Just once.

1344
01:13:26,946 --> 01:13:29,076
Like tonight, I think
I liked him best of all

1345
01:13:29,082 --> 01:13:30,952
when he fell flat on his face.

1346
01:13:30,953 --> 01:13:32,417
You know what I mean?

1347
01:13:32,418 --> 01:13:34,086
I know what you mean.

1348
01:13:34,087 --> 01:13:35,817
Oh, dear.

1349
01:13:35,822 --> 01:13:37,722
It makes people human

1350
01:13:37,724 --> 01:13:40,764
to do something
wrong once in a while.

1351
01:13:42,395 --> 01:13:44,125
Like you.

1352
01:13:44,130 --> 01:13:45,930
Me?

1353
01:13:45,932 --> 01:13:48,702
This evening, in my office.

1354
01:13:50,036 --> 01:13:51,266
Oh.

1355
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,170
Not that I'm for encouraging
that sort of thing,

1356
01:13:53,172 --> 01:13:55,640
you understand.
No, of course not.

1357
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,241
The teacher-student
relationship

1358
01:13:58,244 --> 01:14:00,045
is a very complex one.

1359
01:14:00,046 --> 01:14:02,606
Hmm, very.
You, um...

1360
01:14:02,615 --> 01:14:05,075
You have to be, um, friendly and

1361
01:14:05,084 --> 01:14:08,286
yet keep your distance
at the same time.

1362
01:14:08,287 --> 01:14:09,787
Sure. Sure.

1363
01:14:09,789 --> 01:14:11,559
Otherwise, um, how would you

1364
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:14,857
ever, um, um,
maintain discipline?

1365
01:14:14,861 --> 01:14:16,831
Hmm, it'd be tough.

1366
01:14:23,269 --> 01:14:25,738
Thank you so much
for bringing me home.

1367
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:28,069
It was very nice
of you and I had a...

1368
01:14:36,215 --> 01:14:38,475
Cup of coffee?

1369
01:14:38,484 --> 01:14:39,854
I could use one.

1370
01:14:52,665 --> 01:14:55,495
Would you like to see the view?

1371
01:14:55,501 --> 01:14:59,171
If the view, if you lean out
far enough, it's not bad.

1372
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:03,441
Not bad in here, either.

1373
01:15:03,442 --> 01:15:06,481
You know, I could kill
that secretary of yours.

1374
01:15:06,482 --> 01:15:08,779
She had me convinced
that you and the doctor

1375
01:15:08,782 --> 01:15:11,649
were about to
become a vital statistic.

1376
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:13,886
Hugo?

1377
01:15:13,887 --> 01:15:16,887
Hugo and I are
collaborating on a book.

1378
01:15:16,890 --> 01:15:18,590
Oh!
Yes.

1379
01:15:18,591 --> 01:15:21,731
The psychological factors
of newspaper readership.

1380
01:15:21,732 --> 01:15:25,297
Say, that's a pretty racy title.

1381
01:15:27,300 --> 01:15:30,270
You, um, like a bite
to eat with that coffee?

1382
01:15:30,271 --> 01:15:31,899
You can set the table,
if you will.

1383
01:15:31,905 --> 01:15:33,265
Are you sure it's
not too much trouble?

1384
01:15:33,272 --> 01:15:36,412
Only takes a minute.

"Joel Barlow Stone."

1418
01:17:53,846 --> 01:17:55,476
You found me out, huh?

1419
01:17:56,782 --> 01:18:00,618
Joel Barlow Stone.
Erica Stone.

1420
01:18:00,619 --> 01:18:02,955
What did your father do?

1421
01:18:02,956 --> 01:18:04,956
He ran a country newspaper.

1422
01:18:05,959 --> 01:18:07,159
That's all it was.

1423
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,560
The Eureka Bulletin.

1424
01:18:08,561 --> 01:18:12,097
A country newspaper
read around the world.

1425
01:18:12,098 --> 01:18:13,598
I never tied it up.
You and...

1426
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:15,029
I'm glad.

1427
01:18:15,034 --> 01:18:16,940
At least I know you
didn't come to class

1428
01:18:16,941 --> 01:18:19,006
because I'm my
father's daughter.

1429
01:18:20,373 --> 01:18:22,273
That small one's
the editorial he wrote

1430
01:18:22,275 --> 01:18:24,305
when he won the Pulitzer Prize.

1431
01:18:26,245 --> 01:18:30,315
The Bulletin's front page,
the last one.

1432
01:18:40,659 --> 01:18:43,659
That was on his desk
as long as I can remember.

1433
01:18:44,797 --> 01:18:46,897
What's the matter?

1434
01:18:46,899 --> 01:18:48,499
Uh, nothing.

1435
01:18:48,501 --> 01:18:50,341
It's just that I feel
like a would-be inventor

1436
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:52,366
going through Edison's workshop.

1437
01:18:52,371 --> 01:18:54,041
People always talk about him

1438
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:56,110
as if he were
some sort of a giant.

1439
01:18:56,111 --> 01:18:57,575
You know something?

1440
01:18:57,576 --> 01:18:59,576
He was just
a hard-headed Hoosier

1441
01:18:59,578 --> 01:19:02,418
with a way of putting
his finger on the truth.

1442
01:19:03,549 --> 01:19:05,917
I think you'd have
liked him, Jim.

1443
01:19:05,918 --> 01:19:08,018
I know he'd have liked you.

1444
01:19:11,190 --> 01:19:13,328
Of course,
I never read his newspaper,

1445
01:19:13,329 --> 01:19:15,286
but I certainly read about him.

1446
01:19:15,294 --> 01:19:16,894
I've got stacks of old copies.

1447
01:19:16,895 --> 01:19:19,295
Some day we'll go
through them if you'd like.

1448
01:19:19,298 --> 01:19:21,028
Believe me, this is
an education in itself.

1449
01:19:21,034 --> 01:19:22,367
I'll bet it is.

1450
01:19:22,368 --> 01:19:23,798
That's what this book

1451
01:19:23,802 --> 01:19:25,502
that I'm writing
with Dr. Pine is about.

1452
01:19:25,504 --> 01:19:27,742
To show why
the Bulletin was so great.

1453
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:29,609
It's sort of
a blueprint of journalism

1454
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:31,378
for students to read and follow.

1455
01:19:31,379 --> 01:19:34,646
I once asked you why
you took up teaching.

1456
01:19:34,647 --> 01:19:36,177
I can see now.

1457
01:19:36,182 --> 01:19:38,850
Yes, I want to get
across his ideas.

1458
01:19:38,851 --> 01:19:41,221
What a newspaper meant to him.

1459
01:19:49,628 --> 01:19:52,997
Jim, I'd like you to keep it.

1460
01:19:52,998 --> 01:19:54,798
It should belong to
a good newspaperman.

1461
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,530
I ain't.
But you will be.

1462
01:19:56,535 --> 01:19:58,335
You know, my father
always said I had

1463
01:19:58,337 --> 01:20:00,237
a better nose for
newspapermen than for news.

1464
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:01,706
I can't take that.

1465
01:20:01,707 --> 01:20:03,407
Yes, you can.

1466
01:20:03,409 --> 01:20:05,639
Consider it a bribe, huh?

1467
01:20:05,644 --> 01:20:07,579
Bribe?
Yes.

1468
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:10,950
For you to stick to the decision
that you made tonight.

1469
01:20:10,951 --> 01:20:12,779
Look, I know
it isn't easy to give up

1470
01:20:12,785 --> 01:20:15,585
a steady job for something
that seems like a gamble.

1471
01:20:15,588 --> 01:20:17,488
But I have so much
faith in you, Jim.

1472
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:19,859
I want to help you get started...
No.

1473
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:21,188
I'll do everything...
I can't.

1474
01:20:21,194 --> 01:20:23,304
But I want to.
Don't you understand?

1475
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:26,698
Jim,

1476
01:20:26,699 --> 01:20:29,669
this morning you were
just a very talented pupil.

1477
01:20:31,137 --> 01:20:34,337
But tonight...

1478
01:20:35,508 --> 01:20:37,608
I think we're being whistled at.

1479
01:20:47,286 --> 01:20:50,416
How about some, um, raspberries?

1480
01:20:50,423 --> 01:20:52,890
We have a little, um,

1481
01:20:52,891 --> 01:20:54,291
scrambled eggs?

1482
01:20:55,194 --> 01:20:56,764
Bacon and tomato sandwich?

1483
01:20:58,597 --> 01:21:01,127
Mr. Gallagher, you're pretty
hard to please, I must say.

1484
01:21:01,134 --> 01:21:03,174
Oh, dear, that's had it.

1485
01:21:04,903 --> 01:21:07,339
Say, how about some waffles?

1486
01:21:07,340 --> 01:21:10,310
If I do say so myself,
I make very good hot...

1487
01:21:12,178 --> 01:21:13,748
Jim?

1488
01:22:38,697 --> 01:22:41,097
Oh!

1489
01:23:11,297 --> 01:23:13,527
Oh!

1490
01:23:37,189 --> 01:23:39,156
Morning.

1491
01:23:39,157 --> 01:23:40,557
Hangover?

1492
01:23:40,559 --> 01:23:42,389
Calling what I have a hangover

1493
01:23:42,395 --> 01:23:44,195
is like referring to
the Johnstown flood

1494
01:23:44,196 --> 01:23:45,596
as a slight drizzle.

1495
01:23:46,799 --> 01:23:49,539
I'm sorry you missed
that 8:00 class.

1496
01:23:50,469 --> 01:23:52,469
I may miss the whole semester.

1497
01:24:00,212 --> 01:24:01,612
What do you want?

1498
01:24:02,781 --> 01:24:04,581
Well, I just wanted to
see how you felt.

1499
01:24:04,583 --> 01:24:06,483
I was wondering if there's...

1500
01:24:06,485 --> 01:24:08,445
Do you mind if I
have some coffee?

1501
01:24:08,454 --> 01:24:11,264
If you don't rattle
the cup and saucer.

1502
01:24:44,156 --> 01:24:45,686
Please.

1503
01:24:59,972 --> 01:25:02,342
I've tried some
morning-after cure-alls

1504
01:25:02,343 --> 01:25:04,079
in my time,
but this is about the most...

1505
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:06,536
The recipe was given to me
by an anthropologist.

1506
01:25:06,545 --> 01:25:08,775
It's a mixture used by

1507
01:25:08,781 --> 01:25:11,981
a tribe of cannibals
in the Melanesian Islands.

1508
01:25:11,984 --> 01:25:13,385
They drink this brew

1509
01:25:13,386 --> 01:25:16,046
whenever they eat
a poisoned enemy.

1510
01:25:16,054 --> 01:25:18,964
Of course, it really should
be made with a lizard egg.

1511
01:25:20,793 --> 01:25:22,703
But you can't have everything.

1512
01:25:23,662 --> 01:25:26,030
Now, what do you want?

1513
01:25:26,031 --> 01:25:27,431
Well, this friend of mine...

1514
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:28,833
Please,

1515
01:25:28,834 --> 01:25:30,067
don't shout.

1516
01:25:30,068 --> 01:25:31,335
I wasn't shouting.

1517
01:25:31,336 --> 01:25:32,636
To my ears, at the moment,

1518
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:34,568
you sound like
a parade of banshees.

1519
01:25:37,109 --> 01:25:40,709
Well, you're an authority
on human behavior.

1520
01:25:40,713 --> 01:25:42,551
I thought so until last night.

1521
01:25:42,552 --> 01:25:44,548
I mean you've made
a study of the reactions

1522
01:25:44,550 --> 01:25:46,520
of individuals under
certain conditions.

1523
01:25:46,521 --> 01:25:47,949
Also mice.

1524
01:25:49,455 --> 01:25:53,485
Well. This, uh...
This friend of mine,

1525
01:25:53,492 --> 01:25:55,892
Max, uh, uh, Minnick,

1526
01:25:55,894 --> 01:25:59,196
uh, he, uh, he came to me
the other day with

1527
01:25:59,197 --> 01:26:02,737
a personal problem.
He wanted my advice.

1528
01:26:03,969 --> 01:26:05,939
Well, I didn't know
what to tell him.

1529
01:26:05,940 --> 01:26:08,068
It's, uh, uh...

1530
01:26:08,073 --> 01:26:11,313
I have a feeling if he doesn't
handle this just right,

1531
01:26:11,314 --> 01:26:12,809
he's in real trouble.

1532
01:26:14,079 --> 01:26:16,679
You see, he met this girl...

1533
01:26:16,682 --> 01:26:18,482
Yeah, that's quite a problem.

1534
01:26:19,418 --> 01:26:21,418
I would advise that...

1535
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:22,760
Oh, there's more?

1536
01:26:23,956 --> 01:26:27,625
Now, this girl knew Max
only by name,

1537
01:26:27,626 --> 01:26:29,626
and she hated his guts.

1538
01:26:29,628 --> 01:26:33,297
So in order to get anyplace,
he used a phony name,

1539
01:26:33,298 --> 01:26:35,598
Uh, uh, Max Martin.

1540
01:26:35,601 --> 01:26:38,235
They've been
getting along great,

1541
01:26:38,236 --> 01:26:39,966
but it can't go on like this.

1542
01:26:41,406 --> 01:26:44,175
What should he do?

1543
01:26:44,176 --> 01:26:45,576
Well, it all depends.

1544
01:26:47,112 --> 01:26:49,481
Is he in love with her,
or is this merely

1545
01:26:49,482 --> 01:26:51,382
a transitory amour?

1546
01:26:51,383 --> 01:26:55,520
Well, it started out as a sort
of a hit-and-run proposition

1547
01:26:55,521 --> 01:26:57,091
but he didn't, uh...

1548
01:26:58,891 --> 01:27:00,121
Yeah.

1549
01:27:00,125 --> 01:27:01,425
I guess you could say

1550
01:27:01,426 --> 01:27:02,786
he was sort of in love with her.

1551
01:27:02,795 --> 01:27:04,655
Is he planning to marry her?

1552
01:27:04,663 --> 01:27:07,101
Oh, no, no, no.
Max isn't the marrying kind.

1553
01:27:07,102 --> 01:27:09,569
Yet he didn't take
advantage of this

1554
01:27:09,570 --> 01:27:11,298
hit-and-run proposition.

1555
01:27:11,303 --> 01:27:13,841
It's therefore obvious
that Max has affection

1556
01:27:13,842 --> 01:27:15,639
and a deep respect
toward this lady.

1557
01:27:15,641 --> 01:27:17,171
Oh, yeah, he's got that.

1558
01:27:17,175 --> 01:27:19,635
Well, she's just not
one of those dames, you know.

1559
01:27:19,645 --> 01:27:21,675
In that case,
it's entirely possible

1560
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,680
that he might find
a respectable union

1561
01:27:23,682 --> 01:27:25,016
such as marriage,

1562
01:27:25,017 --> 01:27:28,686
not completely repugnant to him.

1563
01:27:28,687 --> 01:27:33,017
Well, I never thought of
Max as the sort that...

1564
01:27:33,025 --> 01:27:35,855
Hey, you might have
a point there, doc.

1565
01:27:35,861 --> 01:27:37,799
And Max might
have more character

1566
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:39,996
and probity than you
give him credit for.

1567
01:27:41,133 --> 01:27:42,503
Could be.

1568
01:27:44,503 --> 01:27:45,873
Excuse me.

1569
01:27:55,581 --> 01:27:57,021
I'll get it.

1570
01:28:10,495 --> 01:28:12,325
Well, um,

1571
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:14,270
what should Max do, doc?

1572
01:28:16,702 --> 01:28:18,172
Under the circumstances,

1573
01:28:18,173 --> 01:28:21,238
I would advise him to be
completely honest

1574
01:28:21,239 --> 01:28:23,675
and reveal everything.

1575
01:28:23,676 --> 01:28:25,106
You would, huh?

1576
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:27,110
If she's half the woman
he thinks she is,

1577
01:28:27,112 --> 01:28:29,747
she'll understand
and forgive him.

1578
01:28:29,748 --> 01:28:31,948
After all, the man's the same.

1579
01:28:31,950 --> 01:28:34,450
Only the names have been changed

1580
01:28:34,452 --> 01:28:35,987
to protect the guilty.

1581
01:28:35,988 --> 01:28:38,288
But he must do it right away.

1582
01:28:40,092 --> 01:28:41,292
Yeah.

1583
01:28:41,293 --> 01:28:44,903
If she finds out by herself,
Max gets the ax.

1584
01:28:48,266 --> 01:28:50,796
All right. Thanks.

1585
01:28:52,237 --> 01:28:54,107
I'll, uh, tell Max.

1586
01:28:56,341 --> 01:28:57,741
Goodbye, doc.

1587
01:28:57,743 --> 01:28:59,213
Goodbye, Max.

1588
01:29:05,684 --> 01:29:07,184
How'd you know?

1589
01:29:07,185 --> 01:29:10,015
Why, I'm hungover,
not unconscious.

1590
01:29:10,022 --> 01:29:12,692
But I didn't say one
word that you could...

1591
01:29:12,693 --> 01:29:14,360
You're forgetting last night.

1592
01:29:14,361 --> 01:29:16,489
I didn't say
anything last night that...

1593
01:29:16,494 --> 01:29:18,429
But she did.

1594
01:29:18,430 --> 01:29:19,930
The minute I picked her up,

1595
01:29:19,932 --> 01:29:22,670
I knew instantly
something new had been added.

1596
01:29:22,671 --> 01:29:24,238
To begin with,
she forgot to say,

1597
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,596
"happy birthday."

1598
01:29:25,604 --> 01:29:26,974
And all she could talk about

1599
01:29:26,975 --> 01:29:29,682
was this unusual
new student of hers.

1600
01:29:30,843 --> 01:29:32,681
Every time I
changed the subject,

1601
01:29:32,682 --> 01:29:34,978
she came right back to it.
She did?

1602
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:37,780
Constantly,
Mr. Gallagher, or Minnick,

1603
01:29:37,783 --> 01:29:39,883
or Martin,
or whatever your name is.

1604
01:29:39,885 --> 01:29:42,655
Well, my real name's Gannon.

1605
01:29:43,922 --> 01:29:45,089
Oh!

1606
01:29:45,090 --> 01:29:46,860
Gannon of the insulting letter?

1607
01:29:46,861 --> 01:29:48,789
You know about that, too?

1608
01:29:48,794 --> 01:29:52,196
She showed it to me
the moment she received it.

1609
01:29:52,197 --> 01:29:53,827
As a matter of fact, I told her

1610
01:29:53,832 --> 01:29:55,532
what to say
to the class in reply.

1611
01:29:55,533 --> 01:29:57,869
So you were the one.

1612
01:29:57,870 --> 01:30:00,340
Say, you said some
pretty rotten things about me.

1613
01:30:00,341 --> 01:30:04,208
No, she didn't use my reply,
because I agreed with you.

1614
01:30:04,209 --> 01:30:07,378
To me, journalism

1615
01:30:07,379 --> 01:30:09,879
is, uh, like a hangover.

1616
01:30:09,882 --> 01:30:11,619
You can read about it for years

1617
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:13,416
but until you've
actually experienced it,

1618
01:30:13,418 --> 01:30:16,048
you have no conception
of what it's really like.

1619
01:30:16,054 --> 01:30:17,724
Yeah. Yeah,
that's what I felt,

1620
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:19,256
but I've got to admit

1621
01:30:19,257 --> 01:30:20,887
I'm beginning to
think there's something

1622
01:30:20,893 --> 01:30:22,162
to this education bit too.

1623
01:30:22,163 --> 01:30:24,500
The rest of your letter,
however, I found

1624
01:30:24,501 --> 01:30:27,896
filled with puerility,
guilt, and insecurity,

1625
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:30,570
revealing you,
psychologically speaking,

1626
01:30:30,571 --> 01:30:31,898
a complete mess.

1627
01:30:31,904 --> 01:30:33,871
Now wait a minute.

1628
01:30:33,872 --> 01:30:35,642
No. Now, it's useless
for you to hit me.

1629
01:30:35,643 --> 01:30:37,875
I'm going to die anyway.

1630
01:30:37,876 --> 01:30:41,276
Just leave me alone
and let me expire in peace.

1631
01:30:43,181 --> 01:30:45,921
Goodbye,
and don't slam the door.

1632
01:30:53,658 --> 01:30:55,827
Oh, uh, another thing.

1633
01:30:55,828 --> 01:30:58,658
Don't feel too badly
about passing out last night.

1634
01:30:58,663 --> 01:31:01,673
I gave that waiter five bucks
to spike your drinks.

1635
01:31:03,301 --> 01:31:06,801
Oh! Now I understand.

1636
01:31:06,805 --> 01:31:09,035
I only gave him
$2 to spike yours.

1637
01:31:18,917 --> 01:31:20,377
Jim, the colonel's
been calling you.

1638
01:31:20,385 --> 01:31:21,685
All right.

1639
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:23,216
Jim, the colonel
wants to see you.

1640
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:24,391
All right.

1641
01:31:26,424 --> 01:31:28,194
Jim, the colonel's
been calling you.

1642
01:31:28,195 --> 01:31:29,393
I know.

1643
01:31:31,296 --> 01:31:32,696
Barney!

1644
01:31:34,166 --> 01:31:36,166
Gladys, get me...

1645
01:31:36,168 --> 01:31:37,668
Yeah, I know he wants me.

1646
01:31:37,669 --> 01:31:38,969
Get me this call first.

1647
01:31:38,971 --> 01:31:43,571
Miss Erica Stone,
Plaza 3-5-5-9-8.

1648
01:31:43,575 --> 01:31:45,005
Yeah, that's right.

1649
01:31:45,010 --> 01:31:46,640
Call the barber
and tell him I'll be down

1650
01:31:46,644 --> 01:31:49,354
in an hour for a haircut
and a manicure, all right.

1651
01:31:49,355 --> 01:31:51,047
Good morning, Mr. Gannon.

1652
01:31:51,049 --> 01:31:54,119
Get this hat cleaned and blocked
and this thing pressed.

1653
01:31:59,524 --> 01:32:00,958
What's the matter?

1654
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:02,789
Can't a guy get
cleaned up once a year?

1655
01:32:02,795 --> 01:32:04,195
I've got some cologne
in my locker.

1656
01:32:06,698 --> 01:32:08,728
Yeah?

1657
01:32:08,733 --> 01:32:10,133
Oh, she's not?

1658
01:32:10,135 --> 01:32:11,935
Gladys, do me a favor.
Call the florist

1659
01:32:11,937 --> 01:32:13,467
and have him
send her some roses.

1660
01:32:13,471 --> 01:32:15,871
He knows the address.
And put on the card:

1661
01:32:15,874 --> 01:32:19,243
"Pick you up at 6:30."
Sign it "Jim." Yeah.

1662
01:32:19,244 --> 01:32:21,384
Yeah, I'm going to see
the colonel right now.

1663
01:32:27,552 --> 01:32:29,020
Send him right in.

1664
01:32:29,021 --> 01:32:31,021
You better cancel
that luncheon engagement.

1665
01:32:31,023 --> 01:32:32,893
I don't think I can make it.

1666
01:32:34,226 --> 01:32:36,026
Colonel.

1667
01:32:36,028 --> 01:32:38,158
Well, glad you came right in,
Jim.

1668
01:32:38,163 --> 01:32:40,233
I've someone here
I want you to meet.

1669
01:32:40,234 --> 01:32:42,632
Her father was
an old friend of mine.

1670
01:32:42,634 --> 01:32:44,103
Erica, this is Jim Gannon,

1671
01:32:44,104 --> 01:32:47,271
the best city editor
in the business, for my money.

1672
01:32:47,272 --> 01:32:51,108
Jim, this is Miss Stone.
She teaches journalism,

1673
01:32:51,109 --> 01:32:54,178
which makes us all related
in a way, doesn't it?

1674
01:32:54,179 --> 01:32:56,909
Miss Stone has come
to ask a favor of me.

1675
01:32:56,915 --> 01:32:59,175
She's quite excited
about a student of hers,

1676
01:32:59,184 --> 01:33:02,254
A fellow called, uh...
What was that name again?

1677
01:33:04,823 --> 01:33:06,090
Gallagher.

1678
01:33:06,091 --> 01:33:07,558
Ah, yes.

1679
01:33:07,559 --> 01:33:09,528
It seems this Gallagher
is quite exceptional.

1680
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:11,527
Miss Stone brought along
some things he wrote.

1681
01:33:11,529 --> 01:33:12,997
Class work, you know.

1682
01:33:12,998 --> 01:33:15,498
Very good, she says.
I'll read them tonight.

1683
01:33:16,835 --> 01:33:19,495
Now then, it seems to be
generally known

1684
01:33:19,504 --> 01:33:21,238
that you have some, uh,

1685
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:25,039
well, shall we say resistance
to college-trained personnel.

1686
01:33:25,043 --> 01:33:26,913
Miss Stone is
quite aware of that.

1687
01:33:26,914 --> 01:33:28,682
But she feels this
particular fellow

1688
01:33:28,683 --> 01:33:30,210
is so outstanding,

1689
01:33:30,215 --> 01:33:32,315
he may be just the one
to change your attitude.

1690
01:33:32,317 --> 01:33:35,547
Colonel, I...

1691
01:33:35,553 --> 01:33:38,193
I wonder if I could talk to
Miss Stone for a few minutes?

1692
01:33:38,194 --> 01:33:40,790
Why, of course.

1693
01:33:40,792 --> 01:33:42,192
I mean alone.

1694
01:33:42,194 --> 01:33:44,228
I'd like to correct

1695
01:33:44,229 --> 01:33:45,829
any misconceptions
she might have.

1696
01:33:45,830 --> 01:33:48,230
Huh, that's a very good idea.

1697
01:33:48,233 --> 01:33:50,233
I'll bring her in
to you in a few minutes.

1698
01:33:50,235 --> 01:33:52,635
We have a bit more catching up
to do before I give her up.

1699
01:33:52,637 --> 01:33:54,237
But, colonel, I...

1700
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:56,839
And thank you, Jim,
for your cooperation.

1701
01:33:58,276 --> 01:34:00,076
You know who I had
a letter from today?

1702
01:34:00,078 --> 01:34:01,445
John Baldwin.

1703
01:34:01,446 --> 01:34:03,446
He was an old friend
of your father's.

1704
01:34:03,448 --> 01:34:05,948
I remember when the three of us
went to Europe together.

1705
01:34:05,951 --> 01:34:07,951
That was in, oh, 1927.

1706
01:34:25,237 --> 01:34:27,737
Now look, Erica,
before you blow your top,

1707
01:34:27,739 --> 01:34:29,239
I just want to...

1708
01:34:29,241 --> 01:34:31,911
What's the matter?
Aren't you angry?

1709
01:34:32,978 --> 01:34:36,008
No, I'm not angry.

1710
01:34:36,014 --> 01:34:38,182
I just feel a little bruised,

1711
01:34:38,183 --> 01:34:40,817
as if I'd been kicked.

1712
01:34:40,818 --> 01:34:42,418
I'm sorry, Erica, I was going...

1713
01:34:42,420 --> 01:34:44,920
You don't have to explain,
Mr. Gannon.

1714
01:34:44,923 --> 01:34:46,463
I'm sure to you and the boys,

1715
01:34:46,464 --> 01:34:49,888
it was a very funny
practical joke.

1716
01:34:49,894 --> 01:34:51,634
You may have even
bet a few dollars

1717
01:34:51,635 --> 01:34:55,766
that you could make the
professor look like an idiot.

1718
01:34:55,767 --> 01:34:57,797
Well, you did.

1719
01:34:57,802 --> 01:35:00,302
Now why don't you go collect
your bets and leave me alone?

1720
01:35:00,305 --> 01:35:02,105
All right, I admit
it started out as a joke,

1721
01:35:02,107 --> 01:35:04,976
but that didn't last long.

1722
01:35:04,977 --> 01:35:06,807
Why do you think
I left your apartment

1723
01:35:06,811 --> 01:35:08,211
so suddenly last night?

1724
01:35:08,213 --> 01:35:10,083
Oh, I'm sure you had
a pang of conscience.

1725
01:35:10,084 --> 01:35:11,815
I doubt if anyone...

1726
01:35:11,816 --> 01:35:15,286
I didn't want to hurt you
any more than I already had.

1727
01:35:17,855 --> 01:35:19,585
What you did to me
is unimportant.

1728
01:35:19,591 --> 01:35:23,560
But what you did to the other
students is inexcusable.

1729
01:35:23,561 --> 01:35:26,500
They pay their tuition
which they can ill afford.

1730
01:35:26,501 --> 01:35:29,328
And after working hard
at other jobs all day long,

1731
01:35:29,334 --> 01:35:31,240
they study or they come to class

1732
01:35:31,241 --> 01:35:33,166
because they'll
sacrifice anything

1733
01:35:33,171 --> 01:35:34,571
to gain a little more knowledge.

1734
01:35:34,572 --> 01:35:36,040
Now, wait a minute...

1735
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:38,911
Oh, I don't expect you
to understand, Mr. Gannon.

1736
01:35:38,912 --> 01:35:41,478
You're stupid,

1737
01:35:41,479 --> 01:35:43,249
and I think you're proud of it.

1738
01:35:44,682 --> 01:35:46,622
And this makes you cruel.

1739
01:35:48,453 --> 01:35:50,163
And now, may I leave,
if you're finished?

1740
01:36:00,898 --> 01:36:02,698
Are you finished now?

1741
01:36:30,328 --> 01:36:33,768
Roy, here's that Women's
Federation story.

1742
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,000
What about this, Jim?

1743
01:36:39,704 --> 01:36:41,972
Oh, handle it any way you want.

1744
01:36:41,973 --> 01:36:43,840
I do something wrong?

1745
01:36:43,841 --> 01:36:46,141
No.

1746
01:36:46,144 --> 01:36:48,579
Look, yell at me, swear at me,

1747
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:50,150
but please don't be
quiet and polite.

1748
01:36:50,151 --> 01:36:53,048
It's not like you, Jim.

1749
01:36:53,051 --> 01:36:54,621
Sorry. I'll watch myself.

1750
01:36:54,622 --> 01:36:57,189
They look like new, Mr. Gannon.

1751
01:36:59,191 --> 01:37:00,991
Hang them on the cabinet,
will you?

1752
01:37:00,992 --> 01:37:02,532
Yes, sir.

1753
01:37:14,206 --> 01:37:17,036
Well, it's wet and warm
anyway, Jim.

1754
01:37:22,847 --> 01:37:24,547
Mr. Gannon?
Yeah.

1755
01:37:24,549 --> 01:37:28,018
Ahem. Wanna look over
the obituaries I did?

1756
01:37:28,019 --> 01:37:29,349
Roy says they're not bad.

1757
01:37:29,354 --> 01:37:32,364
Whenever you get time.

1758
01:37:37,129 --> 01:37:41,229
Barney, sit down a minute.

1759
01:38:00,518 --> 01:38:02,886
Barney,

1760
01:38:02,887 --> 01:38:04,617
I've been thinking it over

1761
01:38:04,622 --> 01:38:07,691
and I've decided
that your mother is right.

1762
01:38:07,692 --> 01:38:09,862
I think you better go back
and finish school.

1763
01:38:09,863 --> 01:38:11,328
My mother's...

1764
01:38:11,329 --> 01:38:12,698
Now, let's put it this way.

1765
01:38:12,699 --> 01:38:14,697
You'll only be
quitting for a few years

1766
01:38:14,699 --> 01:38:16,229
and when you
want to come back...

1767
01:38:16,234 --> 01:38:17,604
I won't quit.

1768
01:38:19,237 --> 01:38:20,607
Then I'll have to fire you.

1769
01:38:22,974 --> 01:38:24,880
Just when I'm getting started?

1770
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:27,136
You won't do any worse
with an education

1771
01:38:27,145 --> 01:38:29,345
and you might do a lot better.

1772
01:38:31,416 --> 01:38:33,146
What's wrong with this stuff?

1773
01:38:33,151 --> 01:38:34,891
Just tell me...
Just tell me one thing.

1774
01:38:39,157 --> 01:38:41,157
Well, for one thing,

1775
01:38:41,159 --> 01:38:44,228
how do you spell
"philanthropist"?

1776
01:38:44,229 --> 01:38:46,229
How'd you learn to
spell "philanthropist"?

1777
01:38:46,231 --> 01:38:49,400
The way I learned to
spell everything else.

1778
01:38:49,401 --> 01:38:51,801
One lousy letter at a time.

1779
01:38:53,805 --> 01:38:57,165
But the hard way
isn't always the best way.

1780
01:38:57,175 --> 01:38:58,505
I'm not sure it ever is.

1781
01:38:58,510 --> 01:39:01,210
You've always told me experience

1782
01:39:01,213 --> 01:39:02,513
is the most
important thing that...

1783
01:39:02,514 --> 01:39:04,915
Experience is the jockey.

1784
01:39:04,916 --> 01:39:07,676
Education is the horse.

1785
01:39:07,685 --> 01:39:10,945
You'll find out there are a lot
of other places in the world

1786
01:39:10,955 --> 01:39:12,615
beside this City Room.

1787
01:39:12,624 --> 01:39:14,994
You only spend
eight hours a day here.

1788
01:39:14,995 --> 01:39:17,332
If you're lucky,
you sleep eight.

1789
01:39:18,563 --> 01:39:20,563
That leaves eight hours more

1790
01:39:20,565 --> 01:39:24,195
to talk to other people
about other things.

1791
01:39:24,202 --> 01:39:26,570
And if all you know
is newspapers,

1792
01:39:26,571 --> 01:39:28,571
you'll always be
excusing yourself

1793
01:39:28,573 --> 01:39:30,483
and leaving the table.

1794
01:39:32,244 --> 01:39:34,214
I've spent one-third of my life

1795
01:39:34,215 --> 01:39:36,547
going to, staying in,

1796
01:39:36,548 --> 01:39:38,848
and coming back
from men's rooms.

1797
01:39:38,850 --> 01:39:42,150
And that's not
going to happen to you.

1798
01:39:42,153 --> 01:39:44,223
You're fired!

1799
01:40:15,253 --> 01:40:16,887
Oh.

1800
01:40:16,888 --> 01:40:18,288
Max got the ax.

1801
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:20,020
I know, she called me.

1802
01:40:20,024 --> 01:40:22,194
I tried to tell her of your
belated surge of honesty,

1803
01:40:22,195 --> 01:40:24,227
but she wouldn't listen.

1804
01:40:24,228 --> 01:40:25,828
Am I interrupting you working?

1805
01:40:25,830 --> 01:40:28,668
No, merely trying to get
my mind off my head.

1806
01:40:28,669 --> 01:40:30,196
Been going through
some old copies

1807
01:40:30,201 --> 01:40:32,369
of her father's newspaper.

1808
01:40:32,370 --> 01:40:35,870
Research for the book
we're doing together.

1809
01:40:35,873 --> 01:40:37,213
Oh, now, don't worry.

1810
01:40:37,214 --> 01:40:39,278
She'll forgive you eventually.

1811
01:40:41,879 --> 01:40:43,447
No.

1812
01:40:43,448 --> 01:40:46,048
When they hang in your arms
like an old laundry bag,

1813
01:40:46,050 --> 01:40:47,918
it's all over, brother.

1814
01:40:47,919 --> 01:40:50,088
Nonsense.
First she'll go through

1815
01:40:50,089 --> 01:40:52,787
the typical feminine reaction
of indignation,

1816
01:40:52,790 --> 01:40:55,526
then indifference,
then indigestion,

1817
01:40:55,527 --> 01:40:57,157
then insomnia.

1818
01:40:57,161 --> 01:41:01,031
Then she'll accept
your apologies retroactively.

1819
01:41:01,032 --> 01:41:02,999
It's not what I've done.

1820
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:05,669
It's what she's done to me.

1821
01:41:05,670 --> 01:41:07,300
Before, I had contempt

1822
01:41:07,305 --> 01:41:10,535
for eggheads like her and you.

1823
01:41:10,542 --> 01:41:13,342
Well, I was wrong.
Brother, was I wrong.

1824
01:41:13,345 --> 01:41:15,975
But at least I was
definitely wrong.

1825
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:18,415
I was an obstinate, prejudiced,

1826
01:41:18,416 --> 01:41:21,516
inconsiderate,
coldhearted louse!

1827
01:41:21,519 --> 01:41:23,819
But at least I was something!

1828
01:41:23,821 --> 01:41:25,991
Now that I've learned
to respect your kind,

1829
01:41:25,992 --> 01:41:30,990
I'm just a big understanding
remorseful slob.

1830
01:41:30,995 --> 01:41:32,395
A complete zero.

1831
01:41:32,397 --> 01:41:35,027
Oh, that's too bad.

1832
01:41:35,032 --> 01:41:37,000
Maybe you'll get over it.

1833
01:41:37,001 --> 01:41:39,069
Would you like a drink?

1834
01:41:39,070 --> 01:41:41,070
I sure would.
Could I have a martini?

1835
01:41:41,072 --> 01:41:42,441
That's what I started on.

1836
01:41:42,442 --> 01:41:43,740
Well, you'll have to fix it.

1837
01:41:43,741 --> 01:41:45,879
Just the thought
makes my head thump.

1838
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:49,407
You don't know what it's like
to live one way all your life,

1839
01:41:49,414 --> 01:41:51,584
confident that you're right,

1840
01:41:53,050 --> 01:41:56,387
and then suddenly find out
that you're all wrong.

1841
01:41:56,388 --> 01:41:58,618
I'm like a guy whose house
just burned down.

1842
01:41:58,623 --> 01:41:59,992
I've got no place to go.

1843
01:41:59,993 --> 01:42:01,531
When did this feeling
of inadequacy

1844
01:42:01,532 --> 01:42:03,786
first manifest itself?

1845
01:42:03,795 --> 01:42:06,925
I guess it's been creeping
up on me for years,

1846
01:42:06,931 --> 01:42:08,101
like ivy.

1847
01:42:10,067 --> 01:42:11,467
But it really started

1848
01:42:11,469 --> 01:42:14,339
when she got me
asking myself why.

1849
01:42:15,339 --> 01:42:17,908
Now I question everything I do.

1850
01:42:17,909 --> 01:42:20,879
And then this morning,
she called me stupid.

1851
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:23,678
Well, two weeks ago,
I would have belted her.

1852
01:42:23,681 --> 01:42:26,181
But this morning
I say to myself:

1853
01:42:26,183 --> 01:42:28,385
"Why did she call me stupid?"

1854
01:42:28,386 --> 01:42:31,616
And the answer
came to me like that.

1855
01:42:31,623 --> 01:42:33,493
Because I am stupid.

1856
01:42:35,993 --> 01:42:37,133
Vermouth.
Uh...

1857
01:42:50,808 --> 01:42:53,778
Ice. I'm sorry, I used it all.

1858
01:43:11,195 --> 01:43:12,555
Join me?

1859
01:43:12,564 --> 01:43:13,864
Oh, no, no, thanks.

1860
01:43:13,865 --> 01:43:15,595
Nothing in gin
that can hurt you.

1861
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:17,130
Best thing for your stomach.

1862
01:43:19,504 --> 01:43:22,072
Well, all right.

1863
01:43:22,073 --> 01:43:24,813
Let me make sure
the window's closed first.

1864
01:43:29,413 --> 01:43:30,813
Gannon,

1865
01:43:30,815 --> 01:43:33,345
I'm gonna have to
disagree with you.

1866
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:35,250
You're not the least stupid.

1867
01:43:35,252 --> 01:43:37,052
But like so many self-made men,

1868
01:43:37,054 --> 01:43:40,023
you refuse to trust
your own intelligence.

1869
01:43:40,024 --> 01:43:41,958
Intelligence? Huh.

1870
01:43:41,959 --> 01:43:43,389
I know chimpanzees

1871
01:43:43,394 --> 01:43:44,964
who have a better
education than I have.

1872
01:43:44,965 --> 01:43:46,732
I had to cut cards
with the teacher

1873
01:43:46,733 --> 01:43:48,671
to see if I got through
the 8th grade.

1874
01:43:48,672 --> 01:43:51,566
You're confusing
education with schooling.

1875
01:43:51,569 --> 01:43:54,099
Education is the acquisition
of knowledge.

1876
01:43:54,105 --> 01:43:56,505
Which I have acquired
not one ounce of.

1877
01:43:56,508 --> 01:43:57,968
Now, don't be so sure.

1878
01:43:57,975 --> 01:43:59,605
If you care to look it up,
you'll find that

1879
01:43:59,611 --> 01:44:01,780
the definition of knowledge
is "knowing,

1880
01:44:01,781 --> 01:44:03,849
familiarity gained
by experience."

1881
01:44:03,850 --> 01:44:06,018
You'll also find that
wisdom is defined

1882
01:44:06,019 --> 01:44:08,847
as "the possession
of experience and knowledge."

1883
01:44:08,853 --> 01:44:10,687
Now, being experienced,

1884
01:44:10,688 --> 01:44:12,688
you therefore have education,
you have knowledge

1885
01:44:12,690 --> 01:44:15,526
and you have wisdom.
You're brilliant

1886
01:44:15,527 --> 01:44:17,057
and you make a good martini.

1887
01:44:17,061 --> 01:44:18,261
Look, look,

1888
01:44:18,262 --> 01:44:19,800
here, here's a press pass.

1889
01:44:19,801 --> 01:44:21,597
This proves
that I'm a newspaperman.

1890
01:44:21,599 --> 01:44:23,129
Here, here's a driver's license,

1891
01:44:23,134 --> 01:44:25,444
this proves I've passed
a driving test.

1892
01:44:25,445 --> 01:44:26,866
Now, you're a Ph.D.

1893
01:44:26,871 --> 01:44:28,741
That proves that
you're an educated man.

1894
01:44:28,742 --> 01:44:31,309
You know, I don't even have
a high school diploma.

1895
01:44:31,310 --> 01:44:33,738
I know, when you have one,
it doesn't mean anything,

1896
01:44:33,745 --> 01:44:35,345
you lose it, throw it away.

1897
01:44:35,346 --> 01:44:37,346
But if you've never had one

1898
01:44:37,348 --> 01:44:39,348
and you get to my age,

1899
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:41,150
it's like the Nobel Prize.

1900
01:44:44,355 --> 01:44:45,755
Gannon,

1901
01:44:48,259 --> 01:44:49,589
I've sat on many

1902
01:44:49,594 --> 01:44:51,364
university accreditation
committees and I promise

1903
01:44:51,365 --> 01:44:52,831
before you leave tonight

1904
01:44:52,832 --> 01:44:55,200
you'll have a B.A.
In lillibral arts.

1905
01:44:55,201 --> 01:44:56,899
Lillibral?

1906
01:44:56,901 --> 01:44:59,771
There's oxygen seeping into
this room from some place.

1907
01:45:05,042 --> 01:45:06,042
Now.

1908
01:45:06,043 --> 01:45:07,543
The first thing we have to do

1909
01:45:07,545 --> 01:45:08,945
is get you through high school.

1910
01:45:25,396 --> 01:45:28,196
Oh, I think you're
ready for college.

1911
01:45:41,312 --> 01:45:43,282
Now, let's try this.

1912
01:45:51,623 --> 01:45:53,263
Ah, that's great.

1913
01:45:58,229 --> 01:45:59,495
No, no, no, no,

1914
01:45:59,496 --> 01:46:00,726
a bachelor of arts
leaves it buttoned.

1915
01:46:00,732 --> 01:46:02,269
When you get
your master's degree

1916
01:46:02,270 --> 01:46:05,135
then you can wear it open.
No, no, it's no use, doc.

1917
01:46:05,136 --> 01:46:07,696
You know, I may look like
a scholar on the outside,

1918
01:46:07,705 --> 01:46:09,505
but inside I'm still an idiot.

1919
01:46:09,506 --> 01:46:11,306
No.
An experienced idiot,

1920
01:46:11,308 --> 01:46:12,678
but I'm still an idiot.

1921
01:46:12,679 --> 01:46:15,047
Now, don't start
doubting yourself again.

1922
01:46:15,048 --> 01:46:16,046
I can't help it.

1923
01:46:16,047 --> 01:46:17,947
I've lost all my confidence.

1924
01:46:17,949 --> 01:46:19,849
I'm not even sure
I know anything

1925
01:46:19,851 --> 01:46:22,518
about the newspaper business
anymore.

1926
01:46:22,519 --> 01:46:24,855
Maybe she's right.

1927
01:46:24,856 --> 01:46:27,386
Maybe my kind did go out
with Prohibition.

1928
01:46:28,826 --> 01:46:30,626
Oh, that must be
one of my students.

1929
01:46:30,628 --> 01:46:32,728
Why don't you just
relax for a minute?

1930
01:46:32,730 --> 01:46:34,130
I'll get rid of him.

1931
01:46:47,879 --> 01:46:50,146
Hi.
Good evening.

1932
01:46:50,147 --> 01:46:51,477
Feeling better?

1933
01:46:51,482 --> 01:46:52,952
Oh, yeah, yeah, a little.

1934
01:46:52,953 --> 01:46:55,218
How do you feel?
I'm fine.

1935
01:46:55,219 --> 01:46:56,849
What I meant is

1936
01:46:56,854 --> 01:46:58,864
I'd be happy to make it
another night if you like.

1937
01:46:58,865 --> 01:47:00,316
It doesn't bother me, really...

1938
01:47:00,324 --> 01:47:02,759
It's fine.

1939
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:05,760
I brought some of Dad's
original notes with me.

1940
01:47:05,763 --> 01:47:07,301
I thought it
might be interesting

1941
01:47:07,302 --> 01:47:09,528
in chapter four
to show the genesis

1942
01:47:09,533 --> 01:47:11,902
of some of the editorials,
you know?

1943
01:47:11,903 --> 01:47:15,213
And, um, trace them through
the first draft and a...

1944
01:47:19,777 --> 01:47:21,347
He's in the bedroom.

1945
01:47:23,247 --> 01:47:26,747
He'll be all right, I guess,
in a couple of weeks.

1946
01:47:27,919 --> 01:47:29,786
What's the matter with him?

1947
01:47:29,787 --> 01:47:32,355
Oh, utterly despondent,
remorseful.

1948
01:47:32,356 --> 01:47:35,856
Filled with contrition
and ideas of self-destruction.

1949
01:47:39,096 --> 01:47:41,396
But, Hugo...
Martini?

1950
01:47:41,398 --> 01:47:42,928
No, thank you.

1951
01:47:49,473 --> 01:47:52,342
But what surprises me
is the way you treated him.

1952
01:47:52,343 --> 01:47:56,146
The way I treated...?
What he did to me...

1953
01:47:56,147 --> 01:47:59,447
But you should have
asked yourself why he did it.

1954
01:47:59,450 --> 01:48:01,450
You've taken two years
of psychology from me,

1955
01:48:01,452 --> 01:48:03,792
you should have a little
understanding of these things.

1956
01:48:03,793 --> 01:48:06,388
What motivated
this deception of his?

1957
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,190
A desire to humiliate
and hurt me, that's what...

1958
01:48:08,192 --> 01:48:11,862
Never. He has a deep affection
for you, Erica Stone,

1959
01:48:11,863 --> 01:48:15,732
but he is in rebellion
against what you represent.

1960
01:48:15,733 --> 01:48:17,833
Here's a man in
a responsible position,

1961
01:48:17,835 --> 01:48:19,835
who feels insecure and inferior

1962
01:48:19,837 --> 01:48:21,637
because he has
no formal education.

1963
01:48:21,638 --> 01:48:23,106
He meets a teacher,

1964
01:48:23,107 --> 01:48:25,407
the symbol of
academic achievement.

1965
01:48:25,409 --> 01:48:28,339
By deceiving, dominating,
and outwitting the teacher,

1966
01:48:28,345 --> 01:48:30,775
he experiences
the exhilarating feeling

1967
01:48:30,782 --> 01:48:32,949
of superiority.

1968
01:48:32,950 --> 01:48:36,190
His battered and cringing ego
emerges victorious.

1969
01:48:38,289 --> 01:48:40,219
No.

1970
01:48:40,224 --> 01:48:43,359
He's not to be held in contempt,

1971
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:44,830
he's to be pitied.

1972
01:48:47,932 --> 01:48:50,732
I just never
thought of it in that way.

1973
01:49:01,612 --> 01:49:04,682
And you should have seen him
when he came here this evening.

1974
01:49:04,683 --> 01:49:08,681
All of his confidence,
his security completely gone.

1975
01:49:08,685 --> 01:49:11,085
A mere shadow of a man

1976
01:49:11,088 --> 01:49:13,118
doubting his very self.

1977
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,230
You have taken this
once proud and forceful man

1978
01:49:20,231 --> 01:49:22,899
and made of him a weakling,

1979
01:49:22,900 --> 01:49:25,940
bewildered and floundering
in a sea of doubt.

1980
01:49:29,740 --> 01:49:32,110
Joel Barlow Stone.

1981
01:49:34,678 --> 01:49:37,608
I'm sorry, but you stink.

1982
01:49:37,614 --> 01:49:41,454
Now, when he comes out,
be warm and understanding.

1983
01:49:51,762 --> 01:49:53,132
Gannon!

1984
01:49:54,398 --> 01:49:55,798
Gannon!

1985
01:50:01,973 --> 01:50:04,841
Doc, I got my confidence back.

1986
01:50:04,842 --> 01:50:06,282
You know what did it for me?

1987
01:50:06,283 --> 01:50:08,307
Reading the Eureka Bulletin.

1988
01:50:08,312 --> 01:50:11,181
I'm suddenly sure of what
good journalism should be,

1989
01:50:11,182 --> 01:50:16,286
because this is one of the
lousiest papers I've ever seen.

1990
01:50:16,287 --> 01:50:19,255
What's the matter?
Your head again?

1991
01:50:19,256 --> 01:50:20,856
No, yours.

1992
01:50:27,698 --> 01:50:30,328
I'll bet he got a hold of one
of those copies that came out

1993
01:50:30,334 --> 01:50:32,544
while your father
was on his vacation.

1994
01:50:32,545 --> 01:50:33,866
Didn't you?

1995
01:50:36,207 --> 01:50:38,737
No.

1996
01:50:38,742 --> 01:50:42,152
And I'm not going to
try to back out of this one.

1997
01:50:45,616 --> 01:50:47,076
I'm sorry I hurt you again,

1998
01:50:47,084 --> 01:50:49,424
but at least this time it was
done with honesty.

1999
01:50:49,425 --> 01:50:51,590
Martini, anyone?

2000
01:50:53,024 --> 01:50:54,690
Please go on, Mr. Gannon.

2001
01:50:54,691 --> 01:50:57,431
I'm very interested in getting
your critical opinion

2002
01:50:57,432 --> 01:51:00,028
of a newspaper
like the Bulletin.

2003
01:51:02,433 --> 01:51:03,900
Well,

2004
01:51:03,901 --> 01:51:06,139
to begin with,
it isn't even a newspaper.

2005
01:51:06,140 --> 01:51:08,137
It's a guy sitting
around a cracker-barrel,

2006
01:51:08,139 --> 01:51:10,239
talking and talking and talking.

2007
01:51:10,241 --> 01:51:12,041
Isn't it interesting that

2008
01:51:12,043 --> 01:51:14,312
the Pulitzer Prize committee
didn't agree with you?

2009
01:51:14,313 --> 01:51:16,611
He won the prize
for an editorial,

2010
01:51:16,613 --> 01:51:18,051
and it was a brilliant job.

2011
01:51:18,052 --> 01:51:20,418
But he should have stuck
to the editorial page

2012
01:51:20,419 --> 01:51:23,317
and let someone run
the paper who hated words.

2013
01:51:23,320 --> 01:51:27,820
Now, here's a world-shaking
story on page 1.

2014
01:51:27,824 --> 01:51:29,592
At least four columns,

2015
01:51:29,593 --> 01:51:32,833
all about whether those berries
Art Smith was selling yesterday

2016
01:51:32,834 --> 01:51:35,168
were blueberries
or huckleberries.

2017
01:51:35,169 --> 01:51:38,026
Look at this.
Published twice weekly,

2018
01:51:38,035 --> 01:51:40,695
circulation 2,500,

2019
01:51:40,704 --> 01:51:42,174
one page of advertising

2020
01:51:42,175 --> 01:51:45,275
with no other sheet
to give him competition.

2021
01:51:45,276 --> 01:51:47,946
That isn't a newspaper,
it's a hobby!

2022
01:51:49,546 --> 01:51:50,976
You know,

2023
01:51:50,982 --> 01:51:52,982
you may not believe it,
but I'm interested

2024
01:51:52,984 --> 01:51:54,484
in those kids you're teaching.

2025
01:51:54,485 --> 01:51:57,085
But in the name of Pulitzer,
tell them the truth!

2026
01:51:57,088 --> 01:51:58,448
Tell them this is a business,

2027
01:51:58,455 --> 01:52:01,955
a rough, tough,
fighting, clawing business.

2028
01:52:02,926 --> 01:52:04,256
You know, the Chronicle

2029
01:52:04,261 --> 01:52:05,999
has a circulation
of a half million.

2030
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:07,527
Each copy sells for a dime

2031
01:52:07,531 --> 01:52:09,701
and costs at least
10 cents to print.

2032
01:52:09,702 --> 01:52:11,530
We stay alive by advertising,

2033
01:52:11,535 --> 01:52:13,865
the same as every
other paper in this town

2034
01:52:13,870 --> 01:52:15,270
and we battle each other for it.

2035
01:52:15,272 --> 01:52:17,872
I wind up with only
49 columns for news

2036
01:52:17,874 --> 01:52:19,480
and I won't waste four of them

2037
01:52:19,481 --> 01:52:21,936
on whether those berries Art
Smith was selling yesterday

2038
01:52:21,945 --> 01:52:24,415
were blueberries
or huckleberries.

2039
01:52:26,183 --> 01:52:28,421
You're confusing
journalism with loyalty

2040
01:52:28,422 --> 01:52:30,888
and you're giving this paper
a sentimental reverence

2041
01:52:30,889 --> 01:52:32,087
it doesn't deserve.

2042
01:52:32,089 --> 01:52:33,489
Do me a favor.
Tear off the title

2043
01:52:33,490 --> 01:52:34,990
and forget your father wrote it.

2044
01:52:34,992 --> 01:52:37,162
Put in eight pages
of advertising

2045
01:52:37,163 --> 01:52:39,299
and then take an honest
blue pencil to the rest

2046
01:52:39,300 --> 01:52:40,896
and see what you come up with.

2047
01:52:40,897 --> 01:52:42,527
If it's still the same paper,

2048
01:52:42,533 --> 01:52:44,903
then you better put
this back on his desk.

2049
01:52:44,904 --> 01:52:47,301
You gave it to the wrong fellow.

2050
01:53:31,282 --> 01:53:33,620
Leave it go, maybe
the whole joint will burn.

2051
01:53:33,621 --> 01:53:36,286
Don't pour the coffee on it,
it'll explode.

2052
01:53:36,287 --> 01:53:38,947
Hey, Jim, you got
somebody to cover a fire?

2053
01:53:38,955 --> 01:53:40,255
I got a fire of my own.

2054
01:53:40,257 --> 01:53:42,725
The colonel just sent for me.

2055
01:53:42,726 --> 01:53:44,286
Hot copy.

2056
01:53:44,295 --> 01:53:46,955
Let it burn for an hour,
it'll make a better story.

2057
01:53:46,963 --> 01:53:48,663
Maybe this will help.

2058
01:53:48,665 --> 01:53:50,095
Take it out and burn it.

2059
01:53:51,902 --> 01:53:53,102
Good morning, colonel.

2060
01:53:53,104 --> 01:53:54,374
Oh, good morning, Jim.

2061
01:53:54,375 --> 01:53:56,071
You remember Miss Stone.

2062
01:53:56,073 --> 01:53:57,811
She's come back today
with an idea

2063
01:53:57,812 --> 01:54:00,238
which strikes me as
being an excellent one.

2064
01:54:00,244 --> 01:54:02,245
She thought that if we...

2065
01:54:02,246 --> 01:54:03,976
Oh, but you go ahead, Erica.

2066
01:54:03,980 --> 01:54:05,350
After all, it's your idea.

2067
01:54:05,351 --> 01:54:07,949
Thank you, colonel. Uh...

2068
01:54:07,951 --> 01:54:11,551
Uh, Mr. Gannon, I've been
doing a lot of thinking

2069
01:54:11,555 --> 01:54:13,185
and, uh, well,

2070
01:54:13,190 --> 01:54:15,690
when one teaches
the same courses

2071
01:54:15,692 --> 01:54:18,128
semester after semester,

2072
01:54:18,129 --> 01:54:21,729
uh, one is apt to repeat
certain examples

2073
01:54:21,732 --> 01:54:23,932
and certain concepts.

2074
01:54:23,934 --> 01:54:26,144
Yes, one is apt to.

2075
01:54:27,804 --> 01:54:31,441
And, uh, with
the constant repetition,

2076
01:54:31,442 --> 01:54:33,212
if one is...
Is not careful,

2077
01:54:33,213 --> 01:54:36,779
there is a danger
of there becoming

2078
01:54:36,780 --> 01:54:39,149
dogmatic principles.

2079
01:54:39,150 --> 01:54:40,550
Yes, you're quite right.

2080
01:54:40,551 --> 01:54:42,189
Not only in teaching, my dear,

2081
01:54:42,190 --> 01:54:44,886
but if we're not careful
we get into ruts, too.

2082
01:54:44,888 --> 01:54:47,188
Only this morning,
at the staff meeting,

2083
01:54:47,191 --> 01:54:48,591
Jim made the point that

2084
01:54:48,592 --> 01:54:50,330
although we have to
keep the Chronicle

2085
01:54:50,331 --> 01:54:52,597
vital and exciting
and commercial,

2086
01:54:52,598 --> 01:54:54,456
perhaps we ought
to do a little more

2087
01:54:54,465 --> 01:54:56,465
interpretation of the news,

2088
01:54:56,467 --> 01:54:59,797
give our readers
a little more to think about.

2089
01:54:59,803 --> 01:55:01,803
Isn't that right, Jim?

2090
01:55:01,805 --> 01:55:03,835
But pardon me
for interrupting you, dear.

2091
01:55:05,376 --> 01:55:07,506
Oh, that's perfectly
all right, colonel.

2092
01:55:09,413 --> 01:55:11,947
Uh, Mr. Gannon,
I was wondering

2093
01:55:11,948 --> 01:55:13,618
if I could prevail upon you

2094
01:55:13,619 --> 01:55:15,947
to give a series of
guest lectures to my classes?

2095
01:55:15,952 --> 01:55:18,492
You know, Jim,
the practical touch

2096
01:55:18,493 --> 01:55:20,559
added to the academic approach?

2097
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:23,787
The wedding of the old pros
and the eggheads.

2098
01:55:24,995 --> 01:55:27,495
Weren't those
your words, my dear?

2099
01:55:27,498 --> 01:55:29,168
Heh. Exactly, colonel.

2100
01:55:30,701 --> 01:55:34,737
Or perhaps we could debate
certain aspects of journalism.

2101
01:55:34,738 --> 01:55:37,108
The students might
find it very stimulating.

2102
01:55:37,109 --> 01:55:39,137
They sure might.

2103
01:55:39,142 --> 01:55:41,482
Well, I'll let you two
work it out.

2104
01:55:41,483 --> 01:55:42,978
Goodbye, my dear,

2105
01:55:42,979 --> 01:55:45,648
and please feel free
to call on me at any time.

2106
01:55:45,649 --> 01:55:48,119
Oh, goodbye, colonel,
and thank you very much.

2107
01:55:48,120 --> 01:55:50,048
Not at all.
Oh, Jim,

2108
01:55:50,053 --> 01:55:52,691
last night I read this
think piece, you know,

2109
01:55:52,692 --> 01:55:54,419
the one that student wrote.

2110
01:55:54,425 --> 01:55:57,355
It's long, but I think
it's newsworthy.

2111
01:55:59,396 --> 01:56:01,796
Bye-bye, colonel.
Goodbye.

2112
01:56:11,007 --> 01:56:12,537
Long, huh?

2113
01:56:12,543 --> 01:56:15,311
I didn't write it.
One of the staff did.

2114
01:56:15,312 --> 01:56:17,852
To me, anything over
500 words is a novel.

2115
01:56:19,149 --> 01:56:21,317
When do we start this clambake?

2116
01:56:21,318 --> 01:56:23,318
Well, I have a class tonight.

2117
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:25,150
Of course you understand
that the university

2118
01:56:25,155 --> 01:56:26,715
can't pay you anything.

2119
01:56:26,723 --> 01:56:28,763
But since you'll be giving
a series of lectures,

2120
01:56:28,764 --> 01:56:32,428
the dean would like to
give you faculty status.

2121
01:56:32,429 --> 01:56:34,859
Me, on a faculty?

2122
01:56:34,865 --> 01:56:38,365
Oh, no, no, I don't think...
Well, no...

2123
01:56:38,369 --> 01:56:41,639
No, that's a little ridiculous.
I wouldn't know...

2124
01:56:41,640 --> 01:56:44,068
We'll talk it over at lunch.
All right.

2125
01:56:44,074 --> 01:56:45,584
I'll get my coat and hat.

2126
01:56:50,681 --> 01:56:52,011
Hiya, Jim.

2127
01:56:52,015 --> 01:56:53,445
Oh, hello, Bob.

2128
01:56:55,051 --> 01:56:57,320
Mr. Gannon?
Yeah.

2129
01:56:57,321 --> 01:56:59,489
Oh, hello, Mrs. Kovac.

2130
01:56:59,490 --> 01:57:01,760
I just came by to pick up
Barney's things.

2131
01:57:01,761 --> 01:57:03,088
Sure.

2132
01:57:03,093 --> 01:57:06,033
I was hoping I'd bump into you
so I could thank you.

2133
01:57:06,034 --> 01:57:08,298
For what?

2134
01:57:08,299 --> 01:57:11,369
For sending Barney
back to school, for what.

2135
01:57:12,536 --> 01:57:14,736
Is he really going?

2136
01:57:14,738 --> 01:57:16,468
Well, you know,
he's making lots of noises

2137
01:57:16,473 --> 01:57:18,207
about getting another job,

2138
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,338
and he's sore as a boil at you.

2139
01:57:20,344 --> 01:57:22,912
But I know him, he'll go back.

2140
01:57:22,913 --> 01:57:24,513
You know why?

2141
01:57:24,515 --> 01:57:26,345
Because you said so.

2142
01:57:30,821 --> 01:57:32,691
Tell him the day after
he graduates,

2143
01:57:32,692 --> 01:57:35,157
I want him to report back.

2144
01:57:35,158 --> 01:57:36,558
What time?

2145
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:38,860
Nine o'clock, and tell him
not to be late.

2146
01:57:40,797 --> 01:57:43,727
You know something?
I like you.

2147
01:57:45,502 --> 01:57:48,342
I don't care what
anybody says, I like you.

2148
01:57:49,473 --> 01:57:51,441
Goodbye, Mr. Gannon.

2149
01:57:51,442 --> 01:57:52,982
Goodbye, Mrs. Kovac.

2150
01:58:08,024 --> 01:58:11,594
Informal at times, and a little
brutal and hard to accept,

2151
01:58:11,595 --> 01:58:13,655
but it's been an education.

2152
01:58:15,265 --> 01:58:17,295
I didn't know you two
knew each other.

2153
01:58:17,300 --> 01:58:18,700
Oh, yes, I took a class

2154
01:58:18,702 --> 01:58:20,502
from Miss Stone
a couple of years ago.

2155
01:58:20,504 --> 01:58:22,274
Too bad you didn't
learn anything.

2156
01:58:22,275 --> 01:58:23,742
Come here.

2157
01:58:31,382 --> 01:58:35,851
Uh, look, Miller,
we sell advertising

2158
01:58:35,852 --> 01:58:37,552
at 25 bucks an inch.

2159
01:58:37,554 --> 01:58:41,290
The space you use we can't sell.

2160
01:58:41,291 --> 01:58:43,931
Take this story,
and save us about $300.

2161
01:58:46,363 --> 01:58:48,533
And don't just make
the lead a rehash.

2162
01:58:48,534 --> 01:58:51,570
Recent evidence discloses
that the kid had accomplices.

2163
01:58:51,571 --> 01:58:54,668
Oh, no. Salas was alone
when he killed the old man.

2164
01:58:55,872 --> 01:58:58,708
He had four partners
always with him.

2165
01:58:58,709 --> 01:59:01,777
Poverty, prejudice,
bitterness, and despair.

2166
01:59:01,778 --> 01:59:05,047
Salas pulled the trigger
but they loaded the gun.

2167
01:59:05,048 --> 01:59:07,678
Light?
Oh, thanks.

2168
01:59:22,332 --> 01:59:23,772
Well, what are you waiting for?

2169
01:59:23,773 --> 01:59:26,467
You want me to write it for you?

2170
01:59:27,404 --> 01:59:28,744
Ready?

2171
01:59:38,314 --> 01:59:39,849
Who's the dame?

2172
01:59:39,850 --> 01:59:42,350
That's Joel Barlow Stone's
daughter.

2173
01:59:42,352 --> 01:59:43,890
That's a combination for you.

2174
01:59:43,891 --> 01:59:45,717
What have they got in common?

2175
01:59:45,722 --> 01:59:48,357
If I know Jim,
he'll find something.
