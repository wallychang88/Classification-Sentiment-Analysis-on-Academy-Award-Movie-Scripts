<i>Hi, there. I want to talk to you about ducts.</i>

4
00:01:15,534 --> 00:01:18,202
<i>Do your ducts seem old-fashioned,</i>

5
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>out-of-date?</i>

6

<i>We have with us</i>
<i>from the Ministry of Information</i>

12
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:05,792
<i>Deputy Minister, Eugene Helpmann.</i>

13
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:07,877
<i>Good evening, David.</i>

14
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:12,382
<i>What do you believe is behind</i>
<i>this recent increase in terrorist bombings?</i>

15
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,384
<i>Bad sportsmanship.</i>

16
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,886
<i>A ruthless minority of people</i>

17
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,848
<i>seems to have forgotten</i>
<i>certain good old-fashioned virtues.</i>

18
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:24,560
<i>They just can't stand seeing</i>
<i>the other fellow win.</i>

19
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:27,188
<i>If these people would just play the game</i>

20
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,273
<i>they'd get a lot more out of life.</i>

21
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,276
<i>Nevertheless, Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>there are those who maintain</i>

22
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:36,072
<i>that the Ministry of Information</i>
<i>has become too large and unwieldy.</i>

23
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:38,866
<i>In free society,</i>
<i>information is the name of the game.</i>

24
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,703
<i>You can't win the game</i>
<i>if you're a man short.</i>

25
00:02:41,787 --> 00:02:46,249
<i>The cost of it all, seven percent</i>
<i>of the gross national product.</i>

26
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:49,794
<i>I understand this concern</i>
<i>on behalf of the taxpayers.</i>

27
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,256
<i>People want value for money.</i>
<i>That is why we always insist</i>

28
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,884
<i>on the principle</i>
<i>of Information Retrieval Charges.</i>

29
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,138
<i>It's absolutely right and fair</i>

30
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,641
<i>that those found guilty</i>
<i>should pay for their periods of detention</i>

31
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:08,604
<i>and for the information retrieval</i>
<i>procedures used in their interrogation.</i>

32
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:12,275
<i>Do you believe that the government</i>
<i>is winning against terrorists?</i>

33
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,693
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

34
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,198
<i>We're fielding all their strokes,</i>
<i>running all of them out</i>

35
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>and pretty consistently</i>
<i>knocking them for six.</i>

36
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,873
<i>I'd say they're nearly out of the game.</i>

37
00:03:38,844 --> 00:03:42,430
<i>Mr. Helpmann, the bombing campaign</i>
<i>is now in its 13th year.</i>

38
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,849
<i>Beginner's luck.</i>

39
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:47,977
<i>Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.</i>

40
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:52,607
<i>Thank you, David.</i>
<i>And a very merry Christmas to you all.</i>

Mrs. Buttle, are you okay?

73
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,698
We're Department of Works!
Department of Works up here.

74
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,452
- Careful with those bloody things.
- Sure.

75
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,955
Don't take any notice of them.

76
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:56,457
Don't touch me!
Why don't you just get out of here.

77
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,543
Don't you worry.
We'II have everything shipshape in a jiffy.

78
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,212
Nothing to worry about.

79
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,881
It's Tuttle downstairs who can worry.

80
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:07,218
Tuttle? His name's Buttle.
There must be some mistake.

81
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,429
Mistake? We don't make mistakes.

82
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:17,436
Bloody typical. They've gone back
to metric without telling us.

83
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,897
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

84
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,273
Yes...

85
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:53,491
Buttle.

86
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,829
Buttle, Archibald.

87
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,006
Oh, shit!

00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,676
Mister...

00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:18,265
Mr. Lowry, would you step in here, please.

90
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,720
Has anybody seen Lowry?

91
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:02,518
Has anybody seen

92
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,520
Sam Lowry?

93
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:41,765
Sam.

94
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,721
<i>Hello? Sam. Where are you?</i>

95
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,056
- Hello?
<i>- It's 11:00.</i>

96
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:25,059
- What?
<i>- It's 11:00.</i>

97
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,894
Mr. Kurtzmann.

98
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,314
You're up late.

99
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,399
Is it?

100
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:41,200
- The electrics here are up the spout.
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

101
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:42,826
- Yours, too?
- Yes.

102
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,373
I'II be there as soon as I can.
Yes, thanks. 'Bye.

103
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,895
This is not the only statue.

104
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,482
What's this gun for?

105
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:59,153
This one, Sister,
is a nine millimeter submachine gun

106
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:02,865
used for close-quarter combat fighting.
Very effective weapon.

107
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:03,949
Would you like to see it?

108
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:35,856
Sam!

109
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,859
Jack!

110
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,946
Long time no see.

111
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,741
What are you doing here?

112
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,327
Didn't expect to see you
slumming it in Records.

113
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:50,537
- What's the problem?
- Problem? No problem.

114
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,206
Everything's fine. Marvelous.

115
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,793
Alison's in great shape, kids are fine.
I'm on Security Level 5

116
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:59,088
so Mr. Helpmann relies on me
more and more. It's been a great year.

117
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:00,798
You sound worried.

118
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:03,884
Worried? Me?
If I'm worried about anyone, Sam, it's you.

119
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,304
Sam, whatever happened to you?

120
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,139
Records.

121
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:22,653
Sam?

122
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,575
Jack, it's great to see you.
I'm going to be late.

123
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:32,037
Sam, let a friend tell you
your life is going wrong.

124
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,457
Records is a dead-end department.
No security that's worth a damn.

125
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,877
- It's impossible to get noticed.
- I know. Wonderful.

126
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,338
Marvelous. Perfect.

127
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,633
See you, Jack.
Give my regards to Alison and the twins.

128
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,593
- Triplets.
- Triplets?

129
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,471
God, how time flies.

130
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:55,018
A very clear delineation of picture, is it not?
Mobile.

131
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,687
Next!

132
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:04,194
I want to report a wrongful arrest.

133
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,656
You want Information Adjustments.
Different department.

134
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,784
I've been to Information Adjustments.
They sent me here.

135
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:12,911
They said you have a form I need to fill out.

136
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,415
- Have you got an arrest receipt?
- Yeah.

137
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:19,543
Is it stamped?

138
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,712
Stamped?

139
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,383
No, there's no stamp on it, you see.

140
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:30,220
I can't let you have the form
until this is stamped.

141
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,597
Where do I get it stamped?

142
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,224
Information Adjustments.

143
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,238
It's nothing.

144
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:54,870
It keeps picking up old films.
That can't be right, can it?

145
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,664
Perhaps the machine's on the blink.

146
00:15:57,749 --> 00:15:58,790
No, it's not the machine.

147
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,168
There's a mismatch
on the personnel code numbers.

148
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:06,089
Tuttle should've had £31.06
debited against his account, not Buttle.

149
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,092
- My God, a mistake!
- At least it's not ours.

150
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,386
Isn't it? Whose is it?

151
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:13,972
- Information Retrieval.
- Good.

152
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,351
Expediting has put in
for electrical procedures in respect of

153
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:20,229
Buttle, Archibald, shoe-repair operative.

154
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:24,483
But Security has invoiced Admin.
for Tuttle, Archibald, heating engineer.

155
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,611
What a relief. Well, finish your tea, Sam.

156
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,113
Thanks.

157
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:34,201
I don't know what I'd do
if you ever got promoted.

158
00:16:34,285 --> 00:16:38,330
- God, don't worry about that.
- But if they did promote you.

159
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:42,417
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.

160
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,753
- Would you, really?
- Really.

161
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:46,964
You've been promoted.

162
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,972
It's your mother, isn't it?
Pulling strings again.

163
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:03,480
Sam, it's time for you to grow up
and accept responsibility.

164
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:07,651
Your poor father would be appalled
at your lack of promotion.

165
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,697
Mother, I just wish
you would stop interfering.

166
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,409
I don't want promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

167
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:18,829
No, you're not. Jack Lint is a lesson to you.

168
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:22,082
He doesn't have your brains,
but he's got the ambition.

169
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:27,045
You haven't got the ambition. Luckily,
you've got me and the Deputy Minister.

170
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,172
Mr. Helpmann was very close
to your father.

171
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:32,467
Now please, Mrs. Lowry. Don't get upset.

172
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,596
Mr. Lowry, please wait in the reception.
You're giving her wrinkles.

173
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,431
- You see?
- God!

174
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,641
Just try and relax, Mrs. Lowry.

175
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:42,060
I'II make you 20 years younger.

176
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,397
Dr. Jaffe, you are a genius.

177
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:47,941
Would you like to be Surgeon General?

178
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,736
I know simply everybody.

179
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:54,156
They won't know you
when I've finished with you.

180
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,742
First,

181
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,202
we remove the excess derma.

182
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:06,043
Now the flaccid tissues under the eyes
and forehead.

183
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,758
Now, I lift

184
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,136
the wrinkles and the worry lines

185
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,222
right up into the wig, into the hairline.

186
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,352
Now the template.

187
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,649
Now, a bit of sticky. Comme ça!

188
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:32,444
Already she's twice as beautiful
as she was before.

189
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:33,528
<i>Voilà!</i>

190
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:38,075
Mr. Helpmann
was very close to your poor father.

191
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,536
He was close to me. He still is.

192
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:47,584
He'II take you under his wing
when you get to Information Retrieval.

193
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,586
You'II like it there.

194
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:52,005
You're not listening to me, Mother.

195
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,428
What the hell is this, lady?

196
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,431
It's a present for my son. Really!

197
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,227
I hope you like it. It's very exclusive.

198
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:08,939
What on Earth is it?

199
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,942
Something for an executive.

200
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:19,491
Madam Lowry! You look exquisite today.
Merry Christmas.

201
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,952
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.

202
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,414
- You remember my son, Samuel?
- Of course.

203
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,332
We're joining Mrs. Terrain.

204
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,167
Yes, they're waiting.

205
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,636
- Mother, I thought we'd be able to talk.
- We will.

206
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:43,265
- Ida!
- God. She's got what's-her-name with her.

207
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,270
Well, Alma, how are you?

208
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,522
You look wonderful.

209
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,691
Hello, Shirley.

210
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,026
Thank you, Spiro.

211
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,529
- Salt?
- Not yet.

212
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,824
Sam, Happy Christmas.

213
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,203
- So sorry we're late.
- Thanks.

214
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,164
Now, Alma

215
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,249
what are you going to have?

216
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:12,919
I can't make up my mind whether to have
the number one or the number two.

217
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,671
What do you recommend, Spiro?

218
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,882
Between you and me, madame,

219
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:19,801
- today the number two.
- Thank you, Spiro.

220
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,053
Shirley, what are you going to have?

221
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:26,224
Between you and me, mademoiselle,
today the number one.

222
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,143
Madam Lowry?

223
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:32,647
To hell with the diet!
I'm going to have a number eight, please.

224
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,817
- A most perceptive choice, if I may say so.
- Oh, Ida.

225
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,069
<i>- Monsieur?</i>
- Steak, please, rare. Mother...

226
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:40,822
<i>- Monsieur, quel numéro?</i>
- I don't know which number.

227
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,033
- Mother, please...
- That one. There.

228
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,618
Thanks. Mother, will you...

229
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:48,789
Alma! You wicked girl.
You've started your treatments.

230
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,541
- Say the number, please.
- You noticed.

231
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:54,044
- You have to say the number!
- Go away!

232
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:56,004
I must tell you all about it.

233
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,672
Number three.

234
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,678
- Mother, will you listen to me?
<i>- Numéro huit.</i>

235
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,934
Braised veal in wine sauce.

236
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:16,191
It's too exciting.
I've left Dr. Jaffe and gone to Dr. Chapman.

237
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,568
<i>Numéro deux, duck à I'orange.</i>

238
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,821
- Chapman?
<i>- Excusez-moi.</i>

239
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,198
The acid man?

240
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:27,035
Really, Ida. Just because
his techniques are revolutionary.

241
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:30,247
I don't go around calling
Dr. Jaffe "the knife man."

242
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:33,083
<i>Numéro un, crevettes à la mayonnaise.</i>

243
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:34,835
I am sorry, Alma.

244
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:37,838
- I didn't mean to...
- It's all right, Ida.

245
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:40,632
<i>Steak. Numéro trois!</i>

246
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:44,761
<i>Mesdames, monsieur</i>

247
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,639
<i>bon appétit!</i>

248
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,558
<i>- Merci!</i>
<i>- Merci!</i>

249
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:54,354
Acid, on the other hand, can be used
for such wonderfully subtle shading

250
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:56,523
such delicate nuances.

251
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:00,026
Like a Rembrandt etching.
And it is so much quicker.

252
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:04,072
If it wasn't for this complication,
it could've happened to anybody,

253
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,284
I'd have had this dressing off yesterday.

254
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,327
Shirley.

255
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,454
Salt?

256
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,605
What were we saying?

257
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,607
God, this isn't rare.

258
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:43,987
By the by, I saw the most wonderful idea
for Christmas presents at the chemist's.

259
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:46,615
Gift tokens. Medical gift tokens.

260
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,617
That sounds marvelous!

261
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,454
It's good at any doctor's
and most of the major hospitals.

262
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:56,249
It's also accepted
for gynecological examinations

263
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,668
including Caesarian sections.

264
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,212
- Spiro.
- Madam, I don't know what to say.

265
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:05,508
This never happens to us. I'm going
to do something about it straightaway.

266
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:09,679
Sam, can't you do something
about these terrorists?

267
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,890
It's my lunch hour.

268
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,018
Besides, it's not my department.

269
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:19,898
Actually, Alma, that's one of
the little things I've been dying to tell you.

270
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:24,319
Sam's being promoted
to Information Retrieval.

271
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,490
Why, that's wonderful!
Congratulations, Sam.

272
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:33,244
Stop it! I'm not being promoted.
I'm not going to Information Retrieval.

273
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,373
If I wanted to upset you, Mother,
I'd tell you where to stick it.

274
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,753
Pepper?

275
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,006
I've got to go.

276
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,968
You haven't had your dessert.

277
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:50,762
I don't want dessert,
promotion or anything!

278
00:23:50,888 --> 00:23:55,225
Of course you want something.
You must have hopes, wishes, dreams?

279
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,602
No, nothing. Not even dreams.

280
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:09,906
Sam.

281
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:43,857
Sam!

281
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

282
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,274
Oh, God!

283
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,674
Hello. Central Services?

284
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,928
I'm at 579B, Block 19,
Northwestern Section D.

285
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,264
Exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway
at the Orange Blossom Flyover.

286
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:01,601
I've got trouble with my air conditioning.
It's an emergency.

287
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:05,688
<i>Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
<i>I'm sorry, due to staff shortages</i>

288
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:10,193
<i>Central Services cannot take service calls</i>
<i>between 2300 and 0900 hours.</i>

289
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,695
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

290
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,447
This is an emergency!

291
00:26:14,532 --> 00:26:19,202
<i>- Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
- Look, I've got to have a heating engineer.

292
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:22,205
<i>- Thank you for calling Central Services.</i>
- Oh, shit!

293
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,231
Hello.

294
00:26:57,908 --> 00:26:59,701
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

295
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,171
<i>Hello, Mr. Lowry.</i>

296
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:13,006
Yes, who is this?

297
00:27:13,591 --> 00:27:16,593
<i>Put the phone down and raise your hands.</i>

298
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:18,761
What? Who is this?

299
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,267
Nice and easy, now.

300
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:33,276
Just keep your hands where I can see them.

301
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:00,303
What are you doing?

302
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,894
Harry Tuttle, heating engineer,
at your service.

303
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,941
Tuttle?

304
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,277
Are you from Central Services?

305
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,160
I called Central Services.

306
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:25,662
They're overworked these days.

307
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:28,790
Luckily, I intercepted your call.

308
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,125
You did...

309
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,672
Just a minute.
What was that business with the gun?

310
00:28:36,465 --> 00:28:38,466
Just a precaution, sir.

311
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,845
I've had traps set for me before now.

312
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:48,268
Plenty of people in Central Services would
love to get their hands on Harry Tuttle.

313
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,146
Are you telling me that this is illegal?

314
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,238
Well, yes and no.

315
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,865
Officially, only Central Services
can touch this stuff.

316
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,450
Would you hold this, please?

317
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:07,287
But nowadays,
with all the new rules and regulations

318
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,372
they can't get decent staff anymore.

319
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,041
They turn a blind eye as long as I'm careful.

320
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:15,545
But if they could prove that I've been
working on their equipment

321
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:17,880
that's a plate of a different color.

322
00:29:17,965 --> 00:29:20,633
- Wouldn't it be simpler just to...
- Hold this, please.

323
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:22,051
Sorry, yes.

324
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,638
I was saying, wouldn't it be simpler
to work with Central Services?

325
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,682
I couldn't stand the...

326
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,561
- It's getting warm.
- You couldn't stand the what?

327
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:33,563
I couldn't stand the paperwork.

328
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,064
Listen,

329
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,484
this system of yours could be on fire,
and I couldn't turn on a kitchen tap

330
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:41,279
without filling out a 27B/6.

331
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:43,489
Bloody paperwork.

332
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,409
I suppose one has to expect
a certain amount.

333
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,329
Why? I came into this
for the action, the excitement.

334
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:53,916
Go anywhere, travel light. Get in, get out,
wherever there's trouble. A man alone.

335
00:29:55,252 --> 00:29:56,627
They've got the whole country
sectioned off.

336
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:58,671
Can't make a move without a form.

337
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:17,940
Found it. There's your problem.

338
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,193
- Can you fix it?
- No, I can't.

339
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:23,946
But I can bypass it with one of these.

340
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,867
Fine by me.

341
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,624
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

342
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:42,048
Wait here. Wait.

343
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,140
The flashlight.

344
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,229
- Central Services.
- Central Services.

345
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,315
- Yes.
- You rang, sir.

346
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,984
Trouble with your air conditioning?

347
00:31:02,152 --> 00:31:03,653
No, it's all right.

348
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:07,740
It's fixed.

349
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,492
It's fixed?

350
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:13,621
Yes. I mean, it fixed itself.

351
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,581
Fixed itself, did it?

352
00:31:16,625 --> 00:31:17,750
Yes.

353
00:31:19,503 --> 00:31:21,838
Machines don't fix themselves.

354
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,007
He's tampered with it.

355
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:29,095
Sorry you had a wasted journey.

356
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,932
I think we ought to have a look.

357
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,770
Have you got a 27B/6?

358
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:39,188
A 27B/6?

359
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,865
Now look what you've done to him.

360
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:53,035
Have you got a 27B/6?

361
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,455
Not as such.

362
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:59,292
But we'II get one.

363
00:32:00,711 --> 00:32:02,628
It's all right, it's all right.

364
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:06,215
Sorry. I'm a bit of a stickler for paperwork.

365
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:09,218
Where would we be
if we didn't stick to the correct procedures?

366
00:32:09,303 --> 00:32:10,887
We'II be back.

367
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,431
We'II be back!

368
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:20,146
Thanks for coming.

369
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,523
We'II be back, you clever bastard!

370
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,318
- Thank you.
- We'II show you.

371
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:36,245
Thanks, Lowry.
You're a good man in a tight corner.

372
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:48,007
I just happen to work
at the Ministry of Information.

373
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,091
What?

374
00:32:50,761 --> 00:32:53,095
I just happen to know that

375
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:57,600
Information Retrieval
are looking for an Archibald Tuttle,

376
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,435
heating engineer.

377
00:33:02,189 --> 00:33:04,941
You wouldn't by any chance... Would you?

378
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,779
My good friends call me Harry.

379
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:13,574
Information Retrieval?

380
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:15,785
The big boys.

381
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:23,501
What do they want you for?

382
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,007
Time to go.

383
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,093
How's that?

384
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:40,393
You really must let me give you something.

385
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:46,983
How much will it be for the work?

386
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:52,488
Come on. You did me a favor.
Just check the corridor.

387
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,034
Thanks.

388
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,954
Listen, kid. We're all in this together.

389
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,372
Go on.

390
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:16,721
AII clear.

391
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:48,210
I think Kurtzmann is getting suspicious.

392
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,424
What's playing today?

393
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,551
<i>Casablanca.</i>

394
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:58,095
<i>Mr. Lowry, step in here, please.</i>

395
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:03,225
<i>Lowry!</i>

396
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:07,063
<i>Now, Mr. Lowry!</i>

397
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:23,120
Thank God you're here.
We're in terrible trouble.

398
00:35:31,213 --> 00:35:32,546
Look at this.

399
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:35,633
- It's a check.
- It's the refund for Tuttle.

400
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,009
Tuttle?

401
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:40,471
Buttle. I mean Buttle.

402
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,973
It's been confusion from the word go.

403
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,976
He was overcharged
for Information Retrieval procedures.

404
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:48,979
And someone, somewhere,
is trying to make us carry the can.

405
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:52,692
Can I have a look?
I've never seen a refund check before.

406
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,819
I'II bet it's Jeffries.

407
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,905
Yes.

408
00:35:58,115 --> 00:36:01,283
He believes that people
should pay more for their interrogation.

409
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,411
And B: he loathes me.

410
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,329
We've got to get rid of it.

411
00:36:05,414 --> 00:36:08,666
Send it to somebody else.
Better still, send it to Buttle.

412
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,334
After all, it's his check.

413
00:36:10,419 --> 00:36:12,753
I've tried that. Look at this.

414
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,046
You see?

415
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:17,299
The population census
has got him down as dormanted.

416
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:20,970
The Central Collective Storehouse
computer has got him down as deleted.

417
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,054
Hang on.

418
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:24,515
Information Retrieval's
got him inoperative.

419
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,268
Security has got him down as excised.

420
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,104
- Administration's got him as completed.
- He's dead.

421
00:36:32,524 --> 00:36:33,691
Dead?

422
00:36:36,153 --> 00:36:38,070
Well, that's awful.

423
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,453
We'II never get rid of the damn thing now.

424
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,122
What are we going to do, Sam?

425
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,332
Could try the next of kin.

426
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,926
There we go. "Buttle, Veronica, Mrs."

427
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,386
Veronica?

428
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,639
What's the number on the check?

429
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:09,018
27156789

430
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,648
/074328K.

431
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,445
Right into memory.

432
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,823
Central Banking.

433
00:37:24,201 --> 00:37:25,993
Veronica Buttle

434
00:37:26,787 --> 00:37:27,953
Mrs.

435
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,414
Deposit.

436
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,306
Thank God for that.

437
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:49,308
Would you like some tea?

438
00:37:59,569 --> 00:38:01,237
There's a problem.

439
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:03,781
She doesn't have a bank account.

440
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,703
Well, that's it then.

441
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,958
I might just as well
go and hang myself now.

442
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:21,215
This could never have happened
before the stupid 7th tier reorganization.

443
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,925
That's Simmons' doing.

444
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:25,427
He and Jeffries
always sit together at lunch.

445
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:26,846
Bastards!

446
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:37,314
Perhaps we could lose the thing
behind a filing cabinet or something

447
00:38:37,399 --> 00:38:40,860
- or burn it, eat it...
- Look. There is one solution.

448
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,987
- What?
- Drive out to Mrs. Buttle

449
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:46,532
Iet her sign at the back of the check.
She can cash it at the corner sweet shop.

450
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,578
That's brilliant, Sam.

451
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,246
I'II even do it for you.

452
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,665
Here, authorize the check.
What's the address?

453
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,667
Everything's in here.

454
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,463
What shall I do next?

455
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,467
Pink and blue receipts.

456
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:09,179
Sign there, there and there.
And sign the check there.

457
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,187
I think I've broken a bone.

458
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:21,358
My wrist is all limp.
What a pathetic creature I am!

459
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,196
I'II do it for you.

460
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,217
Right. I'II be on my way.

461
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:51,263
Sam?

462
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:56,352
You are good to me, you know.

463
00:39:57,312 --> 00:40:00,397
<i>- Here's looking at you, kid.</i>
- Here's looking at you.

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

464
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:21,919
<i>We interrupt this program</i>

465
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,545

466
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,505
Hello. I wonder if you could tell me where...

467
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,298
Piss off!

468
00:41:13,096 --> 00:41:14,346
Hello.

469
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,933
I'II never confess!

470
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,525
Come on, you've got to interrogate me.

471
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,178
Mrs. Buttle?

472
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,142
Mrs. Buttle?

473
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:10,903
Are you Mrs. Buttle?

474
00:42:18,161 --> 00:42:19,912
My name is Lowry.

475
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,082
Sam Lowry.

476
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:28,629
I'm from the Ministry of Information.

477
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:34,009
I've come to give you a check.

478
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:42,392
It's a refund, actually. There was a mistake.

479
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,311
Mistake?

480
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:47,898
Yes. Not my department, of course.
I'm only Records.

481
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:54,988
I'II tell you what it is. It seems Mr. Buttle
was overcharged by Information Retrieval.

482
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,826
They don't usually make mistakes

483
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:01,662
but I suppose we're all human.

484
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,460
What happened to the...

485
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,717
Actually, my coming here
is rather unorthodox.

486
00:43:15,802 --> 00:43:20,556
Bringing you this check. Any payments are
normally made through Central Computer

487
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,016
but as there were certain

488
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:27,187
difficulties, we thought,
rather than cause delay

489
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:29,898
we'd let you have it now.

490
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,484
It being Christmas and all.

491
00:43:33,486 --> 00:43:35,779
My husband's dead, isn't he?

492
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:41,952
I do assure you, Mrs. Buttle,
the Ministry is very scrupulous

493
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,830
about following up
and eradicating any error.

494
00:43:44,914 --> 00:43:47,624
But if you do have any complaints
you wish to make,

495
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:51,837
I'd be only too happy
to send you the appropriate forms.

496
00:43:52,172 --> 00:43:54,715
What have you done with his body?

497
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:05,142
I don't know anything about that.
I'm really just

498
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:07,436
delivering the check. So if...

499
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,523
Look, if you wouldn't mind
just signing these two receipts,

500
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:16,236
I'd be only too happy to leave you in peace.

501
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,488
He hadn't done anything.

502
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:20,407
He was good!

503
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:26,496
What have you done with his body?

504
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,298
It isn't being very helpful, is it?

505
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:47,142
I didn't have to come here,
you know, Mrs. Buttle.

506
00:44:48,478 --> 00:44:50,646
I'II kill you, you bastard!

507
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,857
Stop it!

508
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,411
Are you all right?

509
00:45:07,789 --> 00:45:09,581
Are you all right?

510
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:16,380
Mrs. Buttle, are you all right?

511
00:45:16,464 --> 00:45:17,589
It's you.

512
00:45:18,591 --> 00:45:20,509
Wait, stop! Don't go!

513
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,918
Stop! I had nothing to do with it. Wait!

514
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,211
Stop!

515
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,737
- Go away.
- Her name's Jill.

516
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:05,781
What?

517
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:07,366
Jill?

518
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:09,117
Jill who?

519
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:10,660
Jill who?

520
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:13,121
Layton.

521
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,875
Jill Layton.

522
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,379
You're a very good little girl.

523
00:47:20,463 --> 00:47:23,465
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for my daddy.

524
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:26,343
He will be pleased when he gets home.

525
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:15,100
Sam, I've just had
the transport pool onto me.

526
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:18,603
You don't know anything about a personnel
transporter gone missing, do you?

527
00:48:18,688 --> 00:48:20,397
Personnel transporter?

528
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:21,815
What?

529
00:48:22,442 --> 00:48:25,235
The pranets, I had a personal transporter.

530
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,696
I'II do the paperwork in the morning.

531
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,783
Is it all right about Mrs. Tuttle...

532
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,869
Buttle's check?

533
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:36,621
Can I forget it?

534
00:48:37,206 --> 00:48:40,125
What a relief. I'm gonna have nightmares.

535
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,421
Damn! Blast!

536
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,424
What's the matter?

537
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:51,470
You don't happen to know
how to get round an IRQ/3, do you?

538
00:48:52,096 --> 00:48:54,639
AII information
on third level suspects is classified.

539
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:59,186
AII inquiries through Information Retrieval.
That's hopeless, they'II tell you nothing.

540
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,397
Come the time they want something
from us, yes.

541
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,900
There's one way I could get round it.

542
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,862
- I could accept my mother's promotion.
- Yes.

543
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:10,197
No!

544
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,575
You can't. You turned it down.

545
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,827
I didn't sign the form.

546
00:49:17,622 --> 00:49:18,914
I did it for you.

547
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,167
- You didn't?
- I did.

548
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:24,586
You didn't!

549
00:49:25,505 --> 00:49:26,713
I did.

550
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:30,842
- Why did you do that?
- That's what you wanted, isn't it?

551
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:33,887
I don't know.

552
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:36,681
I don't know what I want.

553
00:49:38,226 --> 00:49:40,769
Come on, before they turn the lights out.

554
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,079
<i>There is one way around it.</i>

555
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:03,250
<i>I could accept promotion</i>
<i>to Information Retrieval.</i>

556
00:52:21,806 --> 00:52:23,598
What are you doing?

557
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,600
My God, what's going on?

558
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,560
Emergency procedures.

559
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:31,231
I haven't got an emergency.

560
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,857
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

561
00:52:32,942 --> 00:52:35,694
<i>Have a nice day.</i>
<i>This has not been a recording.</i>

562
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,614
Here. Sign that.

563
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,534
What is it?

564
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,995
It's a 27B/6. What do you think it is?
Where is he?

565
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,623
Spoor, come here. I found it.

566
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,001
Spoor, come here!

567
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:55,714
Look there, a bypass valve
on the transformer.

568
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:10,520
You've had that scab Tuttle here.

569
00:53:11,063 --> 00:53:12,063
What are you talking about?

570
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,567
Who fixed your ducts?

571
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,529
I told you before, they fixed themselves.

572
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,615
Where did this come from,
out of your nostril?

573
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,165
Central Services.

574
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:35,253
They don't take kindly to sabotage.

575
00:53:39,425 --> 00:53:41,926
This place is in a terrible state.

576
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:46,014
Just a minute. You're not gonna
leave it like this, are you?

577
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:47,390
Why not?

578
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:50,977
AII you got to do is blow your nose
and it's fixed, isn't it?

579
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,352
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

580
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:54,679
<i>Mrs. Ida Lowry requests the pleasure</i>
<i>of your company</i>

581
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,724
<i>at her apartment tonight from 8:30</i>

582
00:58:00,853 --> 00:58:02,437
<i>to midnight</i>

583
00:58:02,938 --> 00:58:05,189
<i>To celebrate the completion</i>

584
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,608
<i>of her recent cosmetic</i>

585
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:10,319
<i>surgery</i>

586
00:58:30,049 --> 00:58:31,299
Thanks.

587
00:58:31,592 --> 00:58:33,259
It's reply paid.

588
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:34,802
Is it?

589
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,558
Two, three.

590
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,978
<i>Mother, I'm sorry but I am unable</i>
<i>to come to your party</i>

591
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:46,230
You don't have to sing it.

592
00:58:46,315 --> 00:58:47,648
I don't?

593
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:57,658
Aren't you a bit late?
The party started an hour ago.

594
00:58:57,785 --> 00:59:00,536
Yes, it's backlog. Everybody complains.

595
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:03,331
Was it all right otherwise?

596
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:16,177
<i>Mr. Helpmann, I'm keen</i>
<i>to get into Information Retrieval.</i>

597
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,514
<i>Mr. Helpmann,</i>
<i>I'm dying to get at this woman.</i>

598
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:31,067
Where's your invitation?

599
00:59:31,193 --> 00:59:33,361
Don't shoot! Mother!

600
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:39,033
Sam, I'm so glad you came.

601
00:59:40,327 --> 00:59:41,577
Come in.

602
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,538
Mother?

603
00:59:45,874 --> 00:59:48,334
Oh, God, Mother, is that you?

604
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,254
Of course. Isn't it wonderful?

605
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:54,549
The bandages came off just this afternoon.

606
00:59:54,925 --> 00:59:57,176
Come on, darling, join in the fun.

607
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,595
Simply everybody's here.

608
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,515
- Is Mr. Helpmann here? Stop shoving!
- He is.

609
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:05,893
Mr. Helpmann is here,
and he wants to talk to you.

610
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:08,187
Good. I want to talk to him.

611
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:12,108
He says you're the first person
ever to refuse a promotion.

612
01:00:12,234 --> 01:00:16,195
- He thinks you should see a doctor.
- Actually, Mother, I've decided...

613
01:00:16,947 --> 01:00:18,739
Louis, you know Sam.

614
01:00:19,575 --> 01:00:21,367
Can you believe it?

615
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,245
It's just me and my little knife.

616
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,621
Snip.

617
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:27,123
Slice.

618
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:30,501
- Can you believe it?
- Congratulations.

619
01:00:30,586 --> 01:00:33,171
- But this is just the beginning.
- Really?

620
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:36,048
Of course, yes.
You've seen her with her clothes off.

621
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:39,260
Faces are a doddle
compared to tits and ass.

622
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:43,264
- No hairlines.
- Really, Louis!

623
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:46,475
I've been looking for you everywhere.

624
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,941
Mother, I have to talk to Mr. Helpmann.

625
01:00:54,443 --> 01:00:56,694
- You stupid sod.
- Dear boy

626
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,281
what do you think of your mother now?

627
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,116
It will never last.

628
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,953
Excuse me.

629
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:08,289
Dr. Chapman, did you say something?

630
01:01:08,415 --> 01:01:10,750
That technique, I've tried it.

631
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:14,295
A nice effect, but highly unstable.

632
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,132
In six months,
she'II look like Grandma Moses.

633
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:20,468
See here, Chapman.

634
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:24,472
At least mine don't end up looking
like they've been mugged.

635
01:01:29,478 --> 01:01:33,731
<i>What have you done with his body?</i>

636
01:01:38,278 --> 01:01:41,822
- What happened to you?
- There's a little complication.

637
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:46,494
Dr. Chapman says it often happens
with a delicate skin like mine.

638
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,996
Nothing to worry about.

639
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:52,500
He's promised these bandages
will be off in a jiffy.

640
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:56,003
- Actually, there's someone I want to meet.
- I know.

641
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:01,300
Here we are.

642
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:06,013
I'm going to leave you two lovebirds
in peace.

643
01:02:08,267 --> 01:02:10,017
Hello, Shirley.

644
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,312
Come on.

645
01:02:13,939 --> 01:02:15,773
Do you want a drink?

646
01:02:22,030 --> 01:02:23,614
Chase those years away.

647
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:25,366
Listen, Shirley.

648
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:29,537
Look, your mother and my mother
have the idea that...

649
01:02:30,706 --> 01:02:32,290
Look, I'm very flattered.

650
01:02:32,374 --> 01:02:36,043
And, well, I just don't want you
to be under any false impressions.

651
01:02:36,128 --> 01:02:37,712
It's all right.

652
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:40,047
I don't like you, either.

653
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:43,634
Sam!

654
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:47,346
Jack! Excuse me, Shirley.

655
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:50,224
I'm sorry.

656
01:02:53,228 --> 01:02:55,229
- Do you remember Alison?
- Good evening.

657
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:57,815
Alison, Sam Lowry, an old friend.

658
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,900
Alison, yes, of course.

659
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:03,237
- You look different.
- I'm two years older.

660
01:03:03,363 --> 01:03:06,490
And she's been to Dr. Jaffe.
She doesn't like me telling people.

661
01:03:06,575 --> 01:03:08,576
But, in fact, she's really pleased.

662
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:12,496
- I knew there was something different.
- Remember how they used to stick out?

663
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:13,748
What?

664
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,250
Yes, well, rather.

665
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:20,671
- I always used to wonder if they were real.
- What, my ears?

666
01:03:23,425 --> 01:03:26,594
- Dr. Jaffe pinned her ears back.
- Yes, that's...

667
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,889
I always wondered if she wore falsies.

668
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:31,474
Mr. Helpmann.

669
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:33,976
False ears.

670
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:37,938
- Hello, Jack.
- You remember my wife, Alison?

671
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:41,442
Of course, Barbara, isn't it? How are you?

672
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:44,070
Barbara's very well. How are you?

673
01:03:44,279 --> 01:03:45,780
- Fine, thanks.
- Good.

674
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:49,992
Hello, Sam. Ida said you might be here.
Have you got a minute?

675
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,161
Would you excuse us?

676
01:03:52,746 --> 01:03:55,581
Of course. Come on, Alison. Barbara.

677
01:03:57,751 --> 01:03:58,793
Sam,

678
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,799
I need your help.

679
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,615
Thanks very much.

680
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,076
Mr. Helpmann, I'm glad to be of help.

681
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,328
And if I can help you...

682
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:43,003
Your father and I were very close.

683
01:04:43,547 --> 01:04:47,675
Of course, Jeremiah was senior to me,
but we were close friends.

684
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,177
Especially after the bombing.

685
01:04:51,555 --> 01:04:55,182
And now I keep his name alive
at the office every day.

686
01:04:56,351 --> 01:04:59,145
It's as though he's there
still speaking to me.

687
01:04:59,479 --> 01:05:00,980
"'Ere I am

688
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:03,899
"J. H."

689
01:05:06,862 --> 01:05:08,904
The ghost in the machine.

690
01:05:11,533 --> 01:05:14,368
I know he would've wanted me to help you.

691
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:19,165
And I promised your mother

692
01:05:19,541 --> 01:05:23,335
that I'd take you onto the team
at Information Retrieval.

693
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,714
- But I gather that you...
- Well,

694
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,551
actually, Mr. Helpmann,
I've changed my mind.

695
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,054
I've decided I'd accept the transfer.

696
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,724
If I'm not too late.

697
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,101
Too late?

698
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,228
That's for me to say.

699
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:44,398
Well, then I am...

700
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:49,695
Welcome to Information Retrieval.

700
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,500
Top<font color=#FFFF00>Teo</font>.com

701
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:24,813
My name's Lowry.

702
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:27,608
Sam Lowry.

703
01:06:28,610 --> 01:06:31,487
I've been told to report to Mr. Warrenn.

704
01:06:32,113 --> 01:06:33,948
Thirtieth floor, sir.

705
01:06:34,115 --> 01:06:35,783
You're expected.

706
01:06:39,955 --> 01:06:42,706
- Don't you want to search me?
- No, sir.

707
01:06:45,126 --> 01:06:47,628
- Want to see my ID?
- No need, sir.

708
01:06:49,965 --> 01:06:53,175
- But I could be anybody.
- No, you couldn't, sir.

709
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,636
This is Information Retrieval.

710
01:06:56,888 --> 01:06:58,973
The lift's arrived, sir.

711
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,000
Half as terrorists, rest as victims.

712
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,378
Definitely, no.

713
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:54,963
My name's Lowry, Mr. Warrenn.
Sam Lowry.

714
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:58,300
Yes. No. Cancel that. Okay.

715
01:08:59,594 --> 01:09:01,720
Glad to have you on board.

716
01:09:03,765 --> 01:09:06,058
Don't be ridiculous, Jenkins.

717
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:07,643
Yes.

718
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:10,312
You'II like it up here.

719
01:09:10,438 --> 01:09:13,899
We've got a crack team of...
Are they kidding? ...decision makers.

720
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:18,237
In triplicate. I'm expecting big things...
Two copies to Finance! ...of you.

721
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,076
Between you and me, Lowry,

722
01:09:24,327 --> 01:09:27,663
this department is about to be upgraded.

723
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:31,917
Here we are.

724
01:09:32,127 --> 01:09:34,795
Your very own number
on your very own door.

725
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:37,840
And behind that door, your very own office.

726
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:41,093
Congratulations, DZ/015.

727
01:09:41,469 --> 01:09:43,095
Welcome to the team.

728
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,597
Yes. No. Cancel that.

729
01:09:45,807 --> 01:09:47,975
Send two copies to Finance.

730
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,905
You can't borrow any more chairs!
There's only one left in here now

731
01:11:24,989 --> 01:11:27,491
- and I need that to sit on!
- What?

732
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:31,745
Sorry.

733
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:34,540
Who are you?

734
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,417
My name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

735
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:40,379
Oh, yes, the new boy from next door.

736
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,299
My name's Lime. Harvey Lime.

737
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:46,802
Welcome to Expediting.

738
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:50,347
Would you mind
if I borrowed your computer console?

739
01:11:50,431 --> 01:11:53,183
I'II let you have it back in 10 minutes.

740
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:56,353
You want to take my console
into your office?

741
01:11:56,729 --> 01:11:58,981
Yes, just for a few minutes.

742
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,858
I'II tell you what,

743
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:04,278
you tell me what you want,
and I'II do it for you.

744
01:12:05,446 --> 01:12:07,739
I'm a bit of a whiz on that thing.

745
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:11,827
AII right.

746
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:17,332
- I need information on a woman named...
- A woman?

747
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,376
- I see.
- Yes.

748
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:23,714
I know her age and distinguishing marks,
but I need an address, her place of work.

749
01:12:23,798 --> 01:12:26,049
This your dream girl, is it?

750
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:31,221
Look, let me use your console.

751
01:12:31,639 --> 01:12:33,432
You must be joking.

752
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:37,352
When there's a woman involved,
there's no stopping me.

753
01:12:38,313 --> 01:12:40,230
Let's have that sheet.

754
01:12:49,449 --> 01:12:51,283
Sod it, it's broken!

755
01:12:51,492 --> 01:12:53,911
But you haven't switched it on.

756
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:55,829
Oh, yes.

757
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,210
You're putting me off standing there.
Go back to your office.

758
01:13:02,295 --> 01:13:05,213
I'II give you a knock when I've finished.

759
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:08,634
Go on, I'm not going to elope with her.

760
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:11,345
AII right.

761
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,215
Sam!

762
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:12,656
Sam.

763
01:14:16,077 --> 01:14:17,411
Don't go.

764
01:14:19,706 --> 01:14:20,914
Please.

765
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,053
Well?

766
01:14:36,097 --> 01:14:39,266
- Computers are my forte.
- Let me see.

767
01:14:40,518 --> 01:14:44,855
"Gillian Layton. Coloring: white.
Hair: blonde. Eyes: blue. Height: 5'4".

768
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:47,441
"Distinguishing scar on left..."

769
01:14:48,526 --> 01:14:49,609
Is this all you've got?

770
01:14:50,028 --> 01:14:53,780
Best to take things slowly
where some women are concerned.

771
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:55,449
Let me see.

772
01:14:56,576 --> 01:14:58,285
Hey, that's mine!

773
01:14:59,537 --> 01:15:00,871
"Layton.

774
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:04,458
"Truck driver. AII inquiries

775
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:08,295
"reference officer 412/L. Room 5001."

776
01:15:11,591 --> 01:15:12,966
Lowry, glad I caught you.

777
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:16,553
Send that back. Settling down?
I want this order rescinded.

778
01:15:16,637 --> 01:15:20,390
There's a query about a personnel
transporter you took out from the pool.

779
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,393
Or was it a personnel carrier you took?

780
01:15:23,478 --> 01:15:27,939
Send that up to Security.
Anyway, tidy it up, there's a good chap.

781
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,776
Get a new suit. You want the lift?

782
01:16:48,229 --> 01:16:49,855
Can I help you?

783
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,989
I'm looking for Officer 412/L.

784
01:16:59,407 --> 01:17:01,533
He won't be very long now.

785
01:17:05,079 --> 01:17:06,079
I thought so.

786
01:17:12,753 --> 01:17:14,462
You may go in now.

787
01:17:19,802 --> 01:17:21,970
Not that one. That one.

788
01:17:23,014 --> 01:17:24,097
Yes.

789
01:17:31,939 --> 01:17:34,441
Excuse me, are you officer 412/L?

790
01:17:41,449 --> 01:17:42,824
Excuse me!

791
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:46,369
Jack!

792
01:17:49,707 --> 01:17:52,876
I heard you were coming aboard.
Congratulations.

793
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,295
- DZ/015.
- Thanks.

794
01:17:55,963 --> 01:17:57,505
Are you officer 412/L?

795
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:00,800
That's me. For Sam.

796
01:18:00,968 --> 01:18:03,845
- A very happy Christmas.
- Thanks, Jack.

797
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:07,015
- You're settling in all right?
- Yes, fine.

798
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:08,975
I need some information.

799
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:13,188
This is Information Retrieval,
not Information Dispersal.

800
01:18:13,481 --> 01:18:16,233
Amy, don't throw the ball around in here.

801
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,237
- I'm not Amy, I'm Holly.
- Did I call you Amy, darling? I am sorry.

802
01:18:20,321 --> 01:18:22,155
- A triplet?
- One of them, I think.

803
01:18:22,240 --> 01:18:25,408
Barbara's taken
the other two Christmas shopping.

804
01:18:25,493 --> 01:18:28,286
You're not gonna
keep calling her Barbara, are you?

805
01:18:28,371 --> 01:18:32,123
Why not? Barbara's a perfectly good name,
isn't it? Don't you like it?

806
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:35,502
Yes, it's fine.

807
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:39,172
Come on, let's get these together.

808
01:18:41,676 --> 01:18:43,510
I need to find out about a woman.

809
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:47,097
Come on, Chloe, let's show Uncle Sam
how we make the word "cat."

810
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:48,890
- Shall we?
- I'm Holly.

811
01:18:49,016 --> 01:18:50,600
Sorry, love. So you are.

812
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:52,185
This is her.

813
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:56,231
Layton. Oh, shit.

814
01:18:59,402 --> 01:19:01,695
- How much do you know about this?
- Not much.

815
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:04,572
- What does B58/732 mean to you?
- Buttle.

816
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:09,202
I knew it. You always were bloody quick.

817
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:11,788
Who else knows?

818
01:19:11,872 --> 01:19:13,623
Warrenn? Helpmann?

819
01:19:13,958 --> 01:19:16,293
I don't know.
I only know you got the wrong man.

820
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:19,254
Information Transit got the wrong man.

821
01:19:19,338 --> 01:19:22,882
I got the right man. The wrong man
was delivered to me as the right man.

822
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:26,094
I accepted him on good faith
as the right man.

823
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:27,262
Was I wrong?

824
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,264
You killed Buttle?

825
01:19:31,309 --> 01:19:34,894
There are rigid parameters laid down
to prevent such things happening.

826
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,690
It wasn't my fault that Buttle's
heart condition wasn't on Tuttle's file.

827
01:19:38,774 --> 01:19:40,442
How are you getting on?

828
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:45,572
- I really need to know about...
- Tuttle?

829
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:47,615
We'II bring Tuttle in

830
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,286
and interrogate him
at the same voltage as Mr. Buttle.

831
01:19:51,412 --> 01:19:53,580
And juggle the books in electrical banking.

832
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:57,792
- What has Tuttle done?
- We suspect him of freelance subversion.

833
01:19:58,252 --> 01:19:59,586
Freelance subversive?

834
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:03,340
Then all I need to wrap up the case
is the Layton woman.

835
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:07,635
- What has she done?
- She witnessed the Tuttle... Buttle arrest.

836
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,847
Since then she's been going around
making wild allegations

837
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:12,640
trying to exploit the situation.

838
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,101
She's working for someone,
and I don't think it's us.

839
01:20:16,354 --> 01:20:17,729
Terrorist?

840
01:20:20,608 --> 01:20:22,984
<i>Mr. Lint, the next customer</i>
<i>has been delivered.</i>

841
01:20:23,069 --> 01:20:25,528
- Thank you, Myrtle.
- What're you gonna do about Layton?

842
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:29,824
I put her on the detention list.
Security should have her here before 6:00.

843
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,410
What, here?

844
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:35,789
So that she can spill the beans
inside the department?

845
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,123
Don't do that.

846
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:41,836
Why don't I try and get to her for you? I'II...

847
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:45,256
- I'II deactivate her.
- What does that mean?

848
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,300
I want nothing unsavory.

849
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,094
Trust me, Jack.

850
01:20:50,262 --> 01:20:52,597
Come on, put these away.
Mommy will be back.

851
01:20:52,681 --> 01:20:53,681
Let me have her file.

852
01:20:56,435 --> 01:20:58,019
Trust me, Jack.

853
01:20:59,355 --> 01:21:00,730
AII right.

854
01:21:03,567 --> 01:21:06,444
But for Christ's sake, don't lose it.

855
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:10,156
You sit down there, darling.

856
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:13,535
Don't worry, I'II get to her.

857
01:21:13,619 --> 01:21:15,912
You'II never get anywhere
in a suit like that.

858
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:18,957
Here.

859
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:22,419
Try this.

860
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,921
- Bye-bye.
- 'Bye.

861
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:28,550
But, Jack, I...

862
01:21:30,136 --> 01:21:33,763
Put it on, big boy. I won't look at your willy.

863
01:21:44,984 --> 01:21:46,401
Let him go.

864
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,129
Shit!

865
01:23:45,145 --> 01:23:46,271
Oi!

866
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:48,398
- Come out of there.
- What?

867
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:50,984
That's the Deputy Minister's lift.

868
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,236
Sorry, I'm in a hurry.

869
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:56,573
Come here, sonny. Let's see your ID card.

870
01:23:56,657 --> 01:23:57,824
My ID?

871
01:23:58,117 --> 01:23:59,325
Oh, God!

872
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:02,370
This isn't my suit.

873
01:24:02,663 --> 01:24:05,123
Look, my name's Lowry, Sam Lowry.

874
01:24:05,499 --> 01:24:08,293
- Look, really, can't this wait?
- No, sir.

875
01:24:08,836 --> 01:24:11,170
I'm going to have to fill in a report on this.

876
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:13,840
Now, then, what is the date today?

877
01:24:14,341 --> 01:24:16,509
It's the... Oh, God, it'II have to wait!

878
01:24:16,594 --> 01:24:18,177
You, stop!

879
01:24:50,377 --> 01:24:51,419
Stop!

880
01:25:05,434 --> 01:25:08,061
Well done, men. Quick thinking.

881
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:10,688
Excellent work.

882
01:25:12,858 --> 01:25:14,901
I'II take charge of her now.

883
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:16,235
Good.

884
01:25:18,405 --> 01:25:19,572
Okay.

885
01:25:21,617 --> 01:25:24,952
It's a classified matter.

886
01:25:26,747 --> 01:25:31,584
I'II include your fine handling
of the situation in my report.

887
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:33,795
Great.

888
01:25:36,298 --> 01:25:38,383
Merry Christmas, Dawson.

889
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,052
Come along with me, please.

890
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:43,638
Okay, thanks. Well done, men.

891
01:25:44,306 --> 01:25:47,433
Excellent. Good turnout.
Very good, thank you.

892
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:09,747
Just keep moving.

893
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,249
Hey, stop!

894
01:26:13,252 --> 01:26:14,794
Come back here.

895
01:26:15,129 --> 01:26:16,963
Pick up all these things.

896
01:26:17,297 --> 01:26:19,173
Come on, pick them up.

897
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:21,968
Disgraceful.

898
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,762
Can't you even...

899
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:26,848
You illiterate foreign pig!

900
01:26:26,974 --> 01:26:30,184
You come over here
from your own filthy country

901
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,272
and mess up our streets.

902
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:36,315
God!

903
01:26:51,540 --> 01:26:53,541
Well done! Let's go!

904
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:01,841
What are you doing?
For Christ's sake, keep moving!

905
01:27:03,510 --> 01:27:05,052
Get out of my cab.

906
01:27:05,179 --> 01:27:06,929
What? Just drive!

907
01:27:09,016 --> 01:27:12,602
- You've touched me. Nobody touches me.
- What do you...

908
01:27:13,395 --> 01:27:16,397
Please, drive on! Drive on, will you?

909
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,107
Shit. Move over, I'II drive.

910
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:21,027
Don't touch that! Don't touch anything!

911
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:28,409
It's okay, Officer. Thank you.
I've got everything under control.

912
01:27:28,911 --> 01:27:30,411
Oh, shit!

913
01:27:31,079 --> 01:27:35,541
Listen, please drive. Trust me.
You are in terrible danger.

914
01:27:35,751 --> 01:27:37,418
You're an embarrassment.

915
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:39,712
Please drive. Trust me.

916
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:42,173
Drive and I'II explain everything.

917
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:45,259
Please, get out of my cab.

918
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,971
I'm sorry, I...

919
01:27:49,181 --> 01:27:53,476
Okay, you've asked for it.
I'm Information Retrieval Officer

920
01:27:54,895 --> 01:27:57,647
DZ/105 and I'm arresting you so

921
01:27:58,482 --> 01:28:01,651
drive on, or I'II blast your fucking head off!

922
01:28:04,238 --> 01:28:05,238
Go!

923
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,929
Look, I'm sorry about that.
I mean, touching you without permission.

924
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:34,350
Hello, my name's Lowry. Sam Lowry.

925
01:28:34,810 --> 01:28:37,311
I've been...

926
01:28:41,567 --> 01:28:45,570
You won't believe this.
I know it will sound incredible

927
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:48,698
but I've been dreaming about you.

928
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:52,285
No, not like that. I mean, I love you.

929
01:28:52,828 --> 01:28:56,163
I mean, in my dreams, I love you and...

930
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,585
Extraordinary, isn't it?

931
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,673
Anyway.

932
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,639
You don't believe me, do you?

933
01:29:15,517 --> 01:29:20,229
You probably think I'm bonkers, right?
Mad, raving.

934
01:29:21,899 --> 01:29:24,984
No! I think you're very attractive.

935
01:29:27,446 --> 01:29:28,613
What?

936
01:29:29,323 --> 01:29:32,241
Yeah. Sit back. Let me have a look at you.

937
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,792
Oh, yeah.

938
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:45,338
Good looking, sexy. Just my type.

939
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:50,468
I don't believe you.

940
01:29:51,219 --> 01:29:52,511
Why not?

941
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:56,223
Well, I just don't deserve such terrific luck.

942
01:29:57,893 --> 01:29:59,602
You're damn right.

943
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:48,878
You don't trust me, do you?

944
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:28,250
- Oh, my God, we shouldn't have come here!
- I've got a job to do.

945
01:32:28,794 --> 01:32:30,586
But they'II be lying in wait!

946
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:34,173
Christ, you're paranoid.
You got no sense of reality.

947
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:35,966
Wait!

948
01:32:40,347 --> 01:32:43,933
- We should take the lorry and get away!
- Yeah, where to?

949
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:47,436
- Anywhere. As fast as possible.
- There isn't anywhere.

950
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:50,523
- Just far away.
- It's not far enough.

951
01:33:07,874 --> 01:33:09,041
Jill!

952
01:34:02,345 --> 01:34:04,180
What's in the parcel?

953
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:07,474
A Christmas present.

954
01:34:15,609 --> 01:34:17,067
It's heavy.

955
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,029
Heavy Christmas present.

956
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:22,406
If you don't trust me, open it.

957
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:24,825
No, it's fine.

958
01:34:26,286 --> 01:34:28,287
I'd spoil the wrapping.

959
01:34:28,747 --> 01:34:33,459
Anyway, if I want you to trust me,
it's only fair that I should trust you.

960
01:34:40,592 --> 01:34:45,304
Doesn't it bother you, the sort of things
you do at Information Retrieval?

961
01:34:47,307 --> 01:34:49,975
Suppose you'd rather have terrorists.

962
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:57,524
How many actual terrorists
have you met, Sam?

963
01:35:00,987 --> 01:35:03,113
- Actual terrorists?
- Yeah.

964
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:09,328
It's only my first day.

965
01:35:22,968 --> 01:35:24,385
A roadblock.

966
01:35:25,845 --> 01:35:28,222
- What're we gonna do?
- Stay calm.

967
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:31,392
Don't slow down! Don't stop!

968
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:34,687
Please, do as I say. Go straight ahead. Go!

969
01:35:36,648 --> 01:35:39,400
What the fuck are you doing, you stupid...

970
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:55,082
We did it! We broke right through them!

971
01:36:02,882 --> 01:36:05,759
Faster! Don't let them see you. Just go!

972
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,180
Keep going! Faster!

973
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:15,227
- Please, get your foot down!
- Stay off of me!

974
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:50,262
Go faster!

975
01:36:56,353 --> 01:36:59,688
- What if we lose the house?
- Don't touch anything!

976
01:37:00,648 --> 01:37:02,358
Don't touch that!

977
01:37:24,798 --> 01:37:29,301
We did it! We did it!

978
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,142
Oh, no!

979
01:37:52,242 --> 01:37:54,576
What would you like for Christmas?

980
01:37:54,661 --> 01:37:56,453
My own credit card.

981
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,217
- Why have we come here?
- Go away.

982
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:13,804
- Why don't we go back to my flat?
- Forget it.

983
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,097
You don't trust me?

984
01:38:15,181 --> 01:38:18,517
Trust you? A man who hijacks my truck,
loses me my job

985
01:38:18,601 --> 01:38:21,270
has every security man in town
looking for me? Of course I do.

986
01:38:21,354 --> 01:38:23,605
- I was only trying to help.
- Yeah!

987
01:38:24,274 --> 01:38:27,484
I don't trust you either.
What's in that parcel?

988
01:38:28,194 --> 01:38:30,737
You saved it from the lorry.
It must be very special.

989
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:34,074
I saved you from the lorry.
You're not very special.

990
01:38:34,159 --> 01:38:36,743
- I'm gonna open it.
- Don't touch it.

991
01:38:46,504 --> 01:38:47,629
Sam!

992
01:38:47,797 --> 01:38:49,298
It's me

993
01:38:49,716 --> 01:38:51,175
and Shirley.

994
01:38:53,761 --> 01:38:55,262
Mrs. Terrain!

995
01:38:59,434 --> 01:39:01,560
- That should hold it.
- Sam?

996
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:03,645
Hello, Shirley.

997
01:39:07,484 --> 01:39:09,026
What's happened to you now?

998
01:39:09,110 --> 01:39:12,571
My complication had a little complication.

999
01:39:13,031 --> 01:39:16,241
But Dr. Chapman says I'II soon be up

1000
01:39:16,367 --> 01:39:19,244
and bounding about like a young gazelle.

1001
01:39:19,996 --> 01:39:22,915
You buying a Christmas present
for your mother?

1002
01:39:25,752 --> 01:39:27,794
Yes, a little something.

1003
01:39:28,004 --> 01:39:31,340
Shirley and I come here regular-Iarly.

1004
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:34,676
We love romantic lingerie.

1005
01:39:38,389 --> 01:39:40,224
Picture me in these.

1006
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:47,564
Oh, my God!

1007
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:50,108
Sam, where are you going?

1008
01:40:02,205 --> 01:40:03,372
Jill?

1009
01:40:26,646 --> 01:40:28,397
Are you all right?

1010
01:40:31,401 --> 01:40:33,443
You don't deserve to be!

1011
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:36,154
What a bloody stupid thing!

1012
01:40:36,739 --> 01:40:38,615
How could you? Look at these people!

1013
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,950
My God!

1014
01:40:40,743 --> 01:40:42,911
It was a bomb!

1015
01:40:43,162 --> 01:40:46,582
I should've opened it.
I sat there with it next...

1016
01:40:48,084 --> 01:40:50,252
There's your bomb, asshole!

1017
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:57,676
A bribe for official monkeys like you.

1018
01:41:01,598 --> 01:41:03,473
Make yourself useful.

1019
01:41:10,315 --> 01:41:11,481
Here!

1020
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:19,031
Don't touch her! She's hurt.

1021
01:41:22,368 --> 01:41:24,036
Don't touch her!

1022
01:41:27,790 --> 01:41:28,957
Stop!

1023
01:41:37,383 --> 01:41:38,675
Sam, no!

1024
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:55,484
These helmets make your scalp itch.

1025
01:41:55,568 --> 01:41:58,528
Don't mention it.
And they make you sweat.

1026
01:41:58,988 --> 01:42:01,740
Half the time I can never see
where I'm going.

1027
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:05,160
It's a great Niagara of perspiration
coming down.

1028
01:42:05,828 --> 01:42:09,331
I'm lucky. I've got these thick eyebrows.

1029
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:12,918
That keeps it up
and channels it out to the ears.

1030
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:14,002
Jill!

1031
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:15,170
Who's he?

1032
01:42:15,254 --> 01:42:18,507
I don't know,
somebody from Information Retrieval.

1033
01:42:18,591 --> 01:42:20,842
They're always hanging around in lingerie.

1034
01:42:20,927 --> 01:42:22,010
Where is she?

1035
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,057
Jill, is that you?

1036
01:42:27,892 --> 01:42:30,894
Excuse me, sir.
That is government property.

1037
01:42:36,025 --> 01:42:38,360
Jill! Answer me!

1038
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:42,864
I'm looking for a girl with blonde hair.

1039
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:45,367
She's medium height, green eyes.

1040
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:48,704
I don't know, sir.
They check all that at the depot.

1041
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:52,958
We can't allow that.
It's more than our job's worth.

1042
01:42:53,584 --> 01:42:55,460
Jill, you must be here.

1043
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:58,797
You can fill in an application form
if you're a relative.

1044
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,966
Now do stop, sir, please.

1045
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:10,642
Sorry about that, sir.

1046
01:43:11,144 --> 01:43:12,602
Regulations.

1047
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:21,403
This is a black eye
for the department, Lowry.

1048
01:43:21,487 --> 01:43:23,739
I don't care how you behaved at Records.

1049
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:26,241
Informational Retrieval
is an executive branch.

1050
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:29,244
We're proud of our reputation
and we protect it.

1051
01:43:29,328 --> 01:43:33,206
That convoy of personnel carriers
is still not accounted for!

1052
01:43:33,332 --> 01:43:36,376
I thought I told you to deal with it.
And what is this mess?

1053
01:43:36,627 --> 01:43:39,671
An empty desk is an efficient desk!
Good God!

1054
01:43:39,839 --> 01:43:43,425
Queries from Security. Searches
from Central Banking about a check.

1055
01:43:43,509 --> 01:43:46,928
Clarification notices from Accounting
about unreturned receipts!

1056
01:43:47,013 --> 01:43:49,973
- Mr. Warrenn, I have to find out...
- Shut up!

1057
01:43:50,349 --> 01:43:53,226
I don't know what's going on here, Lowry.

1058
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:58,940
But don't think you can intimidate us
with your friends in high places!

1059
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:00,525
Now shape up!

1060
01:44:04,739 --> 01:44:07,824
Lime, I have to use your computer.

1061
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:10,368
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.

1062
01:44:10,703 --> 01:44:14,331
You seem to have rather a lot
to get on with yourself.

1063
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:22,130
Shit!

1064
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,633
Come off it, Jack.

1065
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:27,469
Of course you can check
to see if she's been arrested.

1066
01:44:27,553 --> 01:44:32,724
Sorry, Sam, this case has become
more complicated since last we talked.

1067
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:36,436
But she's innocent, Jack.
She's done nothing wrong.

1068
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:39,773
Tell that to the wives of the men
she blew up this afternoon.

1069
01:44:39,899 --> 01:44:41,900
She's not alone in all this.

1070
01:44:42,026 --> 01:44:43,985
We just had a report in that Tuttle

1071
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:47,781
has wrecked an entire flat
and sabotaged adjacent Central Services.

1072
01:44:47,907 --> 01:44:50,325
As a matter of fact,
it looks like in your block.

1073
01:44:50,409 --> 01:44:53,578
I'd keep my eyes open if I were you. 'Bye.

1074
01:44:54,914 --> 01:44:58,667
But, Jack, you don't think Tuttle
and the girl are in league, do you?

1075
01:44:58,751 --> 01:45:01,878
I do. Everything's connected.
AII along the line.

1076
01:45:01,963 --> 01:45:04,297
Cause and effect, that's the beauty of it.

1077
01:45:04,423 --> 01:45:08,134
Our job is to trace the connections
and then reveal them.

1078
01:45:10,263 --> 01:45:14,516
This whole Buttle-Tuttle confusion
was obviously planned from the inside.

1079
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,268
But, Jack...

1080
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:19,020
She's innocent, Jack.

1081
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:24,442
- We've always been close, haven't we?
- Yes, Jack.

1082
01:45:24,610 --> 01:45:27,946
Until this all blows over,
just stay away from me.

1083
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,247
It's you!

1084
01:47:42,415 --> 01:47:45,583
What's happening?

1085
01:47:46,252 --> 01:47:49,004
Your thermostat's gone, and then some.

1086
01:47:50,172 --> 01:47:52,048
What happened to my flat?

1087
01:47:52,133 --> 01:47:53,842
Hello? What?

1088
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:56,094
It's for you, but,

1089
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:58,346
as you don't live here anymore.

1090
01:47:58,431 --> 01:47:59,848
- What?
- Absolutely.

1091
01:47:59,932 --> 01:48:01,516
Do you know what this is?

1092
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,602
This is an H2206

1093
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:09,315
authorizing the compulsory,
temporary requisitioning of this flat

1094
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,484
for our necessary repairs.

1095
01:48:15,281 --> 01:48:17,407
Don't forget your receipt!

1096
01:48:19,744 --> 01:48:22,787
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit of a stickler
for paperwork.

1097
01:48:26,709 --> 01:48:28,043
Bastards!

1098
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:42,974
What are you doing?

1099
01:49:30,815 --> 01:49:32,941
It's getting cold in here.

1100
01:49:35,152 --> 01:49:36,361
Oh, God!

1101
01:49:37,113 --> 01:49:38,780
It smells badly.

1102
01:49:39,657 --> 01:49:42,408
It's shit! We're filling up with shit!

1103
01:49:58,676 --> 01:49:59,968
Oh, shit.

1104
01:50:02,346 --> 01:50:04,681
We're all in it together, kid.

1105
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:19,112
Jill!

1106
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,702
Are you all right?

1107
01:50:26,453 --> 01:50:30,123
- What happened to you after...
- Your face. Are you hurt?

1108
01:50:32,001 --> 01:50:33,501
No, I'm fine.

1109
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,966
I've been worried sick about you.

1110
01:50:53,147 --> 01:50:55,940
- Who was that?
- That's a friend of mine.

1111
01:50:57,693 --> 01:50:59,402
Oh, God! Holy shit!

1112
01:50:59,737 --> 01:51:01,696
We better get out of here, quick. Come on.

1113
01:51:07,411 --> 01:51:09,370
Thank God! Here, take it.

1114
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:13,333
It's not so big.

1115
01:52:05,386 --> 01:52:07,220
Are you sure this is all right?

1116
01:52:07,304 --> 01:52:08,805
Yes, certain.

1117
01:52:10,224 --> 01:52:12,600
My mother's away for Christmas.

1118
01:52:13,686 --> 01:52:16,646
She's spending it at the plastic surgeon's.

1119
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:21,943
The wraps come off tomorrow.

1120
01:53:02,443 --> 01:53:06,195
Lock the door after me.
Don't answer the phone to anyone.

1121
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:08,448
I won't be long.

1122
01:53:10,117 --> 01:53:12,785
- Where're you going?
- I know a way to save you.

1123
01:53:12,870 --> 01:53:14,996
Trust me. I can do it.

1124
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,789
You can't go without me!

1125
01:53:52,409 --> 01:53:55,495
Excuse me, Dawson, could you
put me through to Mr. Helpmann's office?

1126
01:53:55,579 --> 01:53:59,707
I'm afraid I can't, sir. You have
to go through the proper channels.

1127
01:53:59,792 --> 01:54:02,460
And you can't tell me what
the proper channels are

1128
01:54:02,544 --> 01:54:05,296
because that's classified information.

1129
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:10,593
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing
its tradition of recruiting the brightest.

1130
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,054
Thank you, Dawson.

1131
01:54:20,187 --> 01:54:23,064
- Goodnight, Mr. Lime.
- Goodnight, Dawson.

1132
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:57,723
No, no, Arthur. You're flat on the G!

1133
01:54:57,808 --> 01:55:01,436
It's your breathing.
Take a deep breath after "Noel."

1134
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:03,479
Ready, one, two, three.

1135
01:55:15,117 --> 01:55:18,619
<i>"'Ere I am, J.H."</i>

1136
01:55:19,705 --> 01:55:21,539
<i>The ghost in the machine.</i>

1137
01:55:48,859 --> 01:55:50,359
Mr. Helpmann?

1138
01:56:28,148 --> 01:56:29,649
Mr. Helpmann?

1139
01:57:53,025 --> 01:57:54,191
Jill.

1140
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:47,036
Who's there?

1141
01:58:56,046 --> 01:58:57,797
What do you think?

1142
01:58:58,840 --> 01:59:00,174
Is it me?

1143
01:59:06,848 --> 01:59:08,015
What?

1144
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:15,606
You don't exist anymore.

1145
01:59:16,566 --> 01:59:18,234
I've killed you.

1146
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,865
Jill Layton is dead.

1147
01:59:33,625 --> 01:59:35,960
Care for a little necrophilia?

1148
02:00:39,733 --> 02:00:41,400
Merry Christmas.

1149
02:00:54,915 --> 02:00:57,082
Something for an executive?

1150
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:16,852
She's dead.

1151
02:01:17,270 --> 02:01:19,355
This is a friend of mine.

1152
02:01:22,108 --> 02:01:23,150
No!

1153
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:25,736
Sam!

1154
02:01:32,661 --> 02:01:36,247
93/HKS/608, you are charged
with the following:

1155
02:01:36,331 --> 02:01:38,749
"Giving aid and comfort
to the enemies of society.

1156
02:01:38,834 --> 02:01:41,126
"Attempting to conceal a fugitive
from justice.

1157
02:01:41,211 --> 02:01:44,797
"Passing confidential documents
to unauthorized personnel.

1158
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:48,050
"Destroying government property,
viz. several personnel carriers.

1159
02:01:48,134 --> 02:01:50,970
"Taking possession under false pretences
of said carriers.

1160
02:01:51,054 --> 02:01:53,806
"Forging the signature
of the Head of Records.

1161
02:01:53,890 --> 02:01:57,351
"Misdirecting funds in the form
of a check to A. Buttle

1162
02:01:57,435 --> 02:01:59,228
"through unauthorized channels.

1163
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:01,355
"Tampering with Central Services'
supply ducts.

1164
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:04,233
"Obstructing forces of law and order.

1165
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:06,652
"Disgracing the good name
of the government

1166
02:02:06,736 --> 02:02:09,196
"and the Department
of Information Retrieval.

1167
02:02:09,281 --> 02:02:13,075
"Disrupting the Ministry's
internal communicating system.

1168
02:02:13,827 --> 02:02:16,245
"Wasting Ministry time and paper."

1169
02:02:17,205 --> 02:02:20,708
Now, either you can plead guilty
to seven or eight of the charges

1170
02:02:20,792 --> 02:02:24,128
which will help keep costs down
within your means

1171
02:02:24,212 --> 02:02:28,465
or borrow a sum to be negotiated
from us at a very competitive rate.

1172
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:32,136
We can offer you something
at eleven-and-a-half percent over 30 years

1173
02:02:32,220 --> 02:02:35,306
but you will have to buy insurance
to qualify for this scheme.

1174
02:02:35,515 --> 02:02:37,641
If you prefer something more specific

1175
02:02:37,726 --> 02:02:40,519
say, against electrical charges over £70...

1176
02:02:40,687 --> 02:02:43,480
AII you're requested to do now
is sign this form.

1177
02:02:43,857 --> 02:02:45,441
Think carefully before you sign.

1178
02:02:45,525 --> 02:02:48,861
Thinking ahead in financial matters
is always a wise course.

1179
02:02:49,112 --> 02:02:50,404
Plead guilty.

1180
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:51,989
It's cheaper.

1181
02:02:56,786 --> 02:02:59,997
Sam, what are we going to do with you?

1182
02:03:03,084 --> 02:03:04,585
Where's Jill?

1183
02:03:06,129 --> 02:03:08,005
I've got to find her.

1184
02:03:08,465 --> 02:03:11,383
Please, you've got to get me out of here.

1185
02:03:11,676 --> 02:03:15,387
I understand, Sam.
I know exactly how you feel

1186
02:03:15,722 --> 02:03:18,682
so I brought you a bottle of barley water.

1187
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:21,185
Please help me.

1188
02:03:21,811 --> 02:03:24,939
I assure you,
I'm doing everything within my power.

1189
02:03:25,023 --> 02:03:27,900
But the rules of the game are laid down.

1190
02:03:28,276 --> 02:03:31,320
We all have to play by them. Even me.

1191
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:36,575
It's all a mistake.
You've got to understand that.

1192
02:03:37,452 --> 02:03:42,122
From the Department's point of view,
there was certainly a bit of an own goal.

1193
02:03:42,207 --> 02:03:44,041
I'm not a terrorist.

1194
02:03:44,668 --> 02:03:47,544
You know that. Please get me out of here!

1195
02:03:48,046 --> 02:03:50,881
Sam, Information Retrieval is expensive.

1196
02:03:51,383 --> 02:03:54,468
You're running up an enormous bill
by not cooperating.

1197
02:03:56,888 --> 02:03:58,764
Please, Mr. Helpmann,

1198
02:03:59,724 --> 02:04:01,517
help me find Jill.

1199
02:04:07,065 --> 02:04:09,566
Sam, I think I ought to tell you.

1200
02:04:10,694 --> 02:04:14,488
I'm afraid she's upped stumps
and retired to the pavilion.

1201
02:04:17,033 --> 02:04:18,867
Thrown in the towel.

1202
02:04:20,286 --> 02:04:21,453
Dead?

1203
02:04:22,622 --> 02:04:23,747
Yes.

1204
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:29,003
It's all a bit confusing, but it seems
she was killed resisting arrest.

1205
02:04:34,384 --> 02:04:36,760
No, it's all right. I did that.

1206
02:04:40,098 --> 02:04:42,975
The odd thing is
it appears to have happened twice.

1207
02:04:43,059 --> 02:04:45,769
A bit of a disputed call, I'm afraid.

1208
02:04:47,897 --> 02:04:49,106
Twice?

1209
02:04:50,358 --> 02:04:54,611
There you are. AII I can say is
don't fall at the last fence.

1210
02:04:54,946 --> 02:04:58,115
The finish is in sight.
See you in the paddock.

1211
02:04:58,450 --> 02:05:01,035
Do cooperate. Think of your mother.

1212
02:05:01,244 --> 02:05:03,620
Good luck. Keep your eye on the ball.

1213
02:05:03,705 --> 02:05:06,790
Got to go. Can't keep the orphans waiting.

1214
02:05:16,384 --> 02:05:17,426
No!

1215
02:05:35,737 --> 02:05:39,323
Don't fight it, son. Confess. Quickly.

1216
02:05:40,658 --> 02:05:44,912
If you hold out too long,
you could jeopardize your credit rating.

1217
02:06:35,755 --> 02:06:36,880
Jack?

1218
02:06:46,015 --> 02:06:47,307
Shut up!

1219
02:06:49,727 --> 02:06:52,312
Jack, I'm innocent. Please help me.

1220
02:06:52,689 --> 02:06:53,981
Bastard!

1221
02:06:56,526 --> 02:06:59,403
Jack, this is all a mistake. Please, Jack.

1222
02:06:59,487 --> 02:07:01,280
Take that mask off.

1223
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:08,412
You stupid bastard!

1224
02:07:10,373 --> 02:07:12,291
How could you do this to me?

1225
02:07:12,458 --> 02:07:14,042
Jack, I'm frightened.

1226
02:07:14,127 --> 02:07:16,670
How do you think I feel? You shit!

1227
02:07:16,754 --> 02:07:18,422
- Jack...
- Shut up!

1228
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:27,347
This is a professional relationship.

1229
02:07:31,352 --> 02:07:32,895
You can't!

1230
02:07:35,148 --> 02:07:36,815
No, Jack, please!

1231
02:08:26,282 --> 02:08:27,616
You okay?

1232
02:08:27,742 --> 02:08:28,992
Tuttle!

1233
02:08:29,535 --> 02:08:31,078
Call me Harry.

1234
02:09:19,002 --> 02:09:20,335
Let's go!

1235
02:14:30,563 --> 02:14:34,357
Mr. Lowry, so pleased you could make it.

1236
02:14:34,650 --> 02:14:36,401
Right this way.

1237
02:14:41,866 --> 02:14:43,533
It's a sad loss.

1238
02:14:44,327 --> 02:14:46,494
Your mother was with her at the end.

1239
02:14:50,958 --> 02:14:54,836
Mrs. Terrain has just received
that most wonderful of gifts.

1240
02:14:56,047 --> 02:14:58,381
She came to us physically new.

1241
02:14:59,050 --> 02:15:02,260
She goes hence from us
not so physically new.

1242
02:15:02,345 --> 02:15:04,721
But the spirit never grows old.

1243
02:15:06,307 --> 02:15:07,849
Madam Lowry!

1244
02:15:12,355 --> 02:15:13,605
Mother!

1245
02:15:15,232 --> 02:15:16,441
Sam!

1246
02:15:18,319 --> 02:15:19,736
Mother?

1247
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:23,448
Stop calling me that.

1248
02:15:25,618 --> 02:15:28,536
Mother, please!

1249
02:15:29,038 --> 02:15:31,164
Is this guy bothering you?

1250
02:15:32,375 --> 02:15:33,416
Mother!

1251
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,838
Go away. This is a very sacred moment.

1252
02:18:48,696 --> 02:18:50,655
He's got away from us, Jack.

1253
02:18:50,739 --> 02:18:54,033
I'm afraid you're right, Mr. Helpmann.
He's gone.

1254
02:19:35,492 --> 02:19:39,037
<i>Tomorrow was another day</i>

1255
02:19:40,497 --> 02:19:44,417
<i>The morning found me miles away</i>

1256
02:19:45,711 --> 02:19:50,006
<i>With still a million things to say</i>

1257
02:19:53,510 --> 02:19:55,762
<i>Now</i>

1258
02:19:56,472 --> 02:20:00,767
<i>As twilight beams the sky above</i>

1259
02:20:01,810 --> 02:20:05,229
<i>Recalling thrills of our love</i>

1260
02:20:07,274 --> 02:20:11,277
<i>There's one thing I'm certain of</i>

1261
02:20:12,029 --> 02:20:16,783
<i>Return I will</i>

1262
02:20:18,619 --> 02:20:24,624
<i>To old Brazil</i>

1263
