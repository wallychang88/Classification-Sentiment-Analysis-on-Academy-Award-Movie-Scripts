1
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,786
<i>Our town's boardwalk.</i>

2
00:01:34,194 --> 00:01:40,531
<i>Our last summer party:</i>
<i>The election of Miss Mermaid 1953.</i>

3
00:01:41,668 --> 00:01:43,135
<i>Nice crowd, no?</i>

4
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:49,366
<i>Visitors, tourists,</i>
<i>and a Roman actress as judge.</i>

5
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,809
<i>Everybody's here.</i>

6
00:01:53,313 --> 00:01:57,613
<i>And, of course, we're here too...</i>
<i>the guys...</i>

7
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,484
<i>This is Alberto.</i>

8
00:02:05,992 --> 00:02:08,153
<i>This is Leopoldo, the intellectual.</i>

9
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,360
<i>And here's Moraldo,</i>
<i>the youngest in our crowd.</i>

10
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,330
Look at the lightning.
It's beautiful.

11
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:24,534
<i>The tenor's Riccardo. As always,</i>
<i>this is pretty much his night.</i>

12
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:30,009
<i>And here's Fausto,</i>
<i>our leader and spiritual guide.</i>

13
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,184
Do you believe me now?

14
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:38,720
Do you think I'm that stupid?
Give me my shoe.

15
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:41,554
I will, but give me a kiss.

16
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:44,025
- Let go.
- Give me a kiss.

17
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,027
I said let go.

18
00:02:46,232 --> 00:02:50,032
- Don't be so coy.
- Let me go, you jerk!

19
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,861
The nerve!

20
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,596
Listen, you goose,
you promised me...

21
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:59,139
- Promised you what?
- That before you left...

22
00:02:59,546 --> 00:03:02,310
You're so gullible.
People promise a lot of things.

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:06,246
Think what you promised Sandra.
- Sandra who? You're hallucinating.

24
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:09,114
So now you don't even know her?
That's rich.

25
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:13,691
With four of five votes,
Miss Mermaid 1953 is

26
00:03:13,893 --> 00:03:15,292
Miss Sandra Rubini.

27
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:21,229
My little girl! Just think,
you didn't even want to enter.

28
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:23,029
Your little sister won!

29
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,062
Go, dear, go.

30
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:34,006
Miss Mermaid 1953!

31
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,477
She's really excited.

32
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:43,486
Ladies and gentlemen,
here from Rome is film star Lilia Landi.

33
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:49,185
She will now place the sash
of Miss Mermaid 1953

34
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,729
on our very own beauty queen.

35
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,894
Party's over.

36
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,892
A few words for the fans.

37
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,299
- I...
- Wonderful! She said "I"!

38
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,712
Look! It's lightning!

39
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,777
- I didn't want to compete...
- It's just a passing shower.

40
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:13,419
The party'll continue.
It's just a little...

41
00:04:17,457 --> 00:04:18,788
The check, Mr. Alberto.

42
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:21,187
- Everyone's leaving.
- At least pay your share.

43
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,834
- Introduce me to Lilia Landi.
- Not right now!

44
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,100
There she is. Please.

45
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:44,812
Miss Landi, meet one of
our most esteemed citizens,

46
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,213
playwright Leopoldo Vannucci.
- Delighted.

47
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,354
Most honored.
I've followed your career closely.

48
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,490
He's also our resident poet.

49
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:58,962
It's beautiful outside,
like the end of the world.

50
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,609
Congratulations, Sandra,
Mrs. Rubini.

51
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:18,945
Now you'll be in the movies.

52
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,551
I want you to meet my little girl.

53
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,990
My God! Moraldo!

54
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,535
- What's wrong, Mama?
- Come here! Your sister's sick!

55
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:45,003
- Excuse me, please.
- Get a doctor, quickly!

56
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:51,074
Mama, calm down. It's nothing.
Is there a doctor around?

57
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,351
Yeah... Mancinelli!

58
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,918
Here I am. What's happened?
Step aside! Let me by!

59
00:05:57,123 --> 00:05:59,284
Doctor, my little girl...

60
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:02,723
Here I am. What's happened?

61
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,266
Get out of the way!
Let me through!

62
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,368
It's nothing!
She just needs some air.

63
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:21,742
- Look at poor Sandra!
- It's nothing, Mama. Calm down.

64
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:25,749
- Fausto! Leopoldo, call Fausto!
- Fausto!

65
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,978
Come here!

66
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,619
- Calm down, Mama. It's nothing,
- Nothing? Look at her!

67
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,764
Let me through.

68
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,768
- What happened?
- Sandra fainted.

69
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,675
Is she better?

70
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,177
- Mama.
- Darling!

71
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,446
What's wrong?

72
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,182
I want to die!

73
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:05,187
What? You want to die,
now that you're Miss Mermaid?

74
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:09,384
Don't say that, even as a joke!
Doctor, what's wrong with her?

75
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,158
Answer me.

76
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,858
All right, everyone out!

77
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:01,607
Back already?

78
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:03,147
That's why it's raining.

79
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:05,141
What are you up to?

80
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:09,313
Papa, I gotta leave now,
on business.

81
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,458
Remember that job offer
from Milan?

82
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,457
Well, I've thought about it,
and I'm going to take it.

83
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,790
At this hour?

84
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,989
What have you done now?

85
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,828
Nothing. I'm taking a job.
Aren't you satisfied?

86
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:25,503
What sort of job?

87
00:08:25,705 --> 00:08:29,266
With a company.
They're reliable people.

88
00:08:29,408 --> 00:08:32,343
By the way, can you lend me
5,000 lire for the train?

89
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,572
I'll pay you back
when I get there.

90
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,873
You punk. What did you do?

91
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,549
What did you do?

92
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,652
Nothing. I just got a job.

93
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,751
Don't you believe me?
I'm catching the 1:00 train.

94
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,660
I'll see who it is.

95
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,137
Hello, Mr. Francesco.
How are you?

96
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,699
Hi, Moraldo. Come in.

97
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,134
Come on in.

98
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:08,908
Sit down.

99
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,475
Excuse us, Papa. Okay?

100
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:20,089
Some downpour, no?
Summer's over - too bad.

101
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:21,453
Cigarette?

102
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:24,653
- You only have one left.
- Never mind. I don't want it.

103
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:27,894
It'll rain for days.

104
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,532
Depressing, huh?

105
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,339
- So you're going?
- Yeah, I'm splitting.

106
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,813
- Will you be gone long?
- I don't know... depends.

107
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,614
And Sandra?

108
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:48,548
She's Miss Mermaid now.
She must be happy.

109
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,454
Sandra's expecting.

110
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:55,126
Yeah, I know.

111
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,058
That's why I'm splitting.

112
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:01,828
I'd like to do the right thing,
but how can I?

113
00:10:02,034 --> 00:10:05,492
I'm broke, like you.
That's why I'm going to Milan.

114
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,764
I wanna do something with my life.

115
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:12,470
Just till I get on my feet.
Don't you believe me?

116
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:15,274
I didn't say a word.

117
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:20,218
Look, we understand each other.
I really love Sandra.

118
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:25,624
I'll swear by whatever you want,
by my own mother. I really love her.

119
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,391
It was fate.

120
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:34,492
Be honest. In my shoes, wouldn't you
first try to make it on your own?

121
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:39,830
- I don't know.
- You're hopeless.

122
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,277
Why not go with me?

123
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:49,640
We'll go together.
This town's dead in winter.

124
00:10:50,516 --> 00:10:55,283
If not Milan, we'll go somewhere else.
We've always wanted to leave.

125
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,616
- Right now?
- This is our big chance!

126
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,516
And Sandra will be thrilled,
you'll see.

127
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,627
Let's go and talk outside.

128
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,224
Be quiet. Don't make any noise.

129
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:07,729
- But I...
- Come on!

130
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:11,032
Turn off the light.

131
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:14,169
Papa! Excuse me, Moraldo.

132
00:11:14,473 --> 00:11:16,634
Can I have that 5,000 lire?

133
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,271
What do you want it for?

134
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,311
To run out?
- No, Papa.

135
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,712
You get in trouble and you run.
I'll wring your neck.

136
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,987
- Papa, please...
- Shut up! Come here!

137
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,050
What are you gonna do, Papa?

138
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,319
I swear I'll...
Get out of my way!

139
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:36,853
You little weasel!

140
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:41,124
I swear by your poor mother
that your foul escapades are over!

141
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,665
That girl's father is a decent guy.

142
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,431
Worked all his life, like me,

143
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,803
idiot that I am,
to support his family honestly.

144
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:55,803
You'll marry her, if I have to kick
your ass all the way to the church.

145
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,277
You bastard!

146
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,010
What's going on, Papa?

147
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,081
Nothing.

148
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,188
Go back to bed.

149
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:12,596
You will marry her.
I'll make sure of that.

150
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,542
Hey, Fausto.

151
00:12:41,527 --> 00:12:43,791
Go ahead, laugh, idiots.
My father's crying.

152
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,768
<i>So they got married.</i>

153
00:12:56,976 --> 00:13:00,002
<i>It was a lovely wedding,</i>
<i>even if a bit hastily arranged.</i>

154
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,154
<i>Riccardo sang</i> Ave Maria
<i>and made us all cry.</i>

155
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:28,469
<i>And the parish priest,</i>
<i>who'd known us forever,</i>

156
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,799
<i>gave a very moving speech.</i>

157
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,807
My children...

158
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:35,807
you can't imagine
what a joy it is for me

159
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,575
to join you in holy matrimony.

160
00:13:39,718 --> 00:13:41,310
You, dear Fausto...

161
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,283
and you, dear Sandra.

162
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:51,524
See? Quick and painless.
Good for you.

163
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:04,205
See, Papa?
I'm a married man now.

164
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,245
My little girl.

165
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,156
Hold it. Stand together.

166
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,892
Alberto, you're standing
in front of the bride.

167
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,637
Don't quarrel!

168
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,971
Be careful crossing
the streets in Rome!

169
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,268
What are you crying for?

170
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:17,411
- Riccardo.
- I'm coming.

171
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,062
- Where to now?
- Let's go to Marina.

172
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,869
Good-bye, Francesco.

173
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,566
Thanks, Mr. Rubini.

174
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:49,280
You'll see.
Fausto's not really a bad kid.

175
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:50,206
I know.

176
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,850
This must be your little girl.
Your youngest?

177
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,610
Yes, she's an angel.

178
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,185
Of course,

179
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,346
Fausto will live with us

180
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,416
until he can support himself
and his wife.

181
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:04,055
Good day.

182
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:08,090
Why does she treat him like that?

183
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,260
Take us home.

184
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:19,234
Can we buy you a drink,
Mr. Francesco?

185
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,870
No, thank you, Riccardo.
I'm going home.

186
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,679
- Nine and two... that's 11.
- 11 to 20.

187
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,551
You think you won?

188
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,390
Leopoldo, mark two points
for me, please.

189
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,588
Leopoldo, why the long face?

190
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,092
I'm depressed.

191
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:44,761
What's the big deal?
Just 'cause those two left...

192
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,770
- I wonder if they're in Rome yet.
- What a drag!

193
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:51,773
You gotta know your way
around Rome to have any real fun.

194
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,343
If he'd gone with me,
it'd be a different story.

195
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,277
A couple of phone calls
and we could have had a ball.

196
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,042
And what about Sandra?

197
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:03,584
I meant if we were single.

198
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:09,250
If I went on a honeymoon,
I'd go to Africa, like Hemingway.

199
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,396
Free, in the wild, in a Jeep.

200
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:13,860
Sounds fabulous.

201
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,398
Africa would be a real escape.

202
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,627
I'd go there with Esther Williams.
- What about Franca Marzi?

203
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:22,070
Franca Marzi, Ginger Rogers.

204
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:23,866
Oh, I know!

205
00:17:24,076 --> 00:17:27,204
Remember the surveyor's girlfriend?
The one who burned her shoulder.

206
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:31,042
- The Ciuffini girl.
- Yeah, Africa with her!

207
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:33,013
I'd prefer India.

208
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,409
Antonio.

209
00:17:38,157 --> 00:17:40,216
Come on, I called you.

210
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,821
You're always in the way.
What do you want?

211
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,868
You can talk all you like,
but he's in Rome and we're stuck

212
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,539
in this dirty little rat hole.

213
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,203
They make a nice couple, though.

214
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,710
Nice couple?

215
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:04,382
She's a pretty girl,

216
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:06,451
but not Fausto, with that face!

217
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:08,813
He's tall and well built.

218
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,488
- And he has a decent voice.
- Big deal.

219
00:18:12,024 --> 00:18:15,482
We all have voices.

220
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:22,495
Didn't you have any inkling
about Fausto and your sister?

221
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,831
To be straight about it,
Fausto was a real cad.

222
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,066
He's a scoundrel.
- I wouldn't go that far.

223
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:35,975
He's a passionate creature,
driven by animal instincts.

224
00:18:36,181 --> 00:18:39,947
What are you talking about?
You think you're writing a play?

225
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,713
Fausto's just a horny...
It's as if one of you went with my sister.

226
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:45,719
Now there's an idea!

227
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,762
Alberto, leave her alone.

228
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:06,277
Bastards, you oughta be in bed!

229
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,833
<i>What's left for us to do?</i>

230
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,907
<i>Another day has come to an end.</i>
<i>Nothing to do but go home, as usual.</i>

231
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:41,369
<i>Alberto lives</i>
<i>with his mama and sister,</i>

232
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,743
<i>and he knows that</i>
<i>Mama waits up until he gets in.</i>

233
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:46,315
Alberto's home.

234
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,967
<i>Riccardo, as usual,</i>
<i>stares at his growing gut.</i>

235
00:20:16,748 --> 00:20:19,080
<i>Helluva time to walk in,</i>
<i>you little punk!</i>

236
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,650
'Night, Papa. 'Night, Mama.

237
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:26,314
<i>After eating the meal</i>
<i>his aunts have left for him,</i>

238
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:29,187
<i>Leopoldo prepares to work</i>
<i>on his new play.</i>

239
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,227
<i>He puts on his favorite</i>
<i>record,</i> Fly the Night

240
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,124
<i>and sits at his table.</i>

241
00:20:38,136 --> 00:20:41,936
<i>Removing the cap of his pen,</i>
<i>he draws a triangle</i>

242
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,676
<i>and watches his characters</i>
<i>parade across the ceiling.</i>

243
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,530
Caterina.

244
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:11,034
<i>She's the neighbors' maid.</i>

245
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,167
Hi, Caterina. How's it going?

246
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:16,238
Not so good.
It's too cold out.

247
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:19,643
How are you doing?
- Okay. I'm working.

248
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,073
Really?

249
00:21:24,082 --> 00:21:25,982
What a lovely moon!

250
00:21:26,918 --> 00:21:29,386
- As lovely as you.
- Liar!

251
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,222
Why do you always play that song?

252
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,751
It inspires me.

253
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,799
<i>Just like every other night,</i>
<i>only Moraldo walks the empty streets.</i>

254
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,559
What if I left too?

255
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,297
Where are you off to?

256
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:24,007
It's 3:00 a.m.
Aren't you gonna sleep?

257
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,873
Sleep? I just got up.
I always get up at 3:00.

258
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,341
- Why?
- I go to work.

259
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,280
Work?

260
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:33,914
At the station.

261
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,021
Sit down a minute.
What do you do?

262
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:42,923
What kinda work?

263
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,720
I just told you: I work.

264
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:52,299
- Is this a railroad cap?
- Yeah.

265
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:02,108
Tell me, are you happy?

266
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,409
It's okay.

267
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,445
- Want a smoke?
- Sure.

268
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,789
I had one here...

269
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,463
Sorry, I'm out.
- Never mind. I gotta go.

270
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,394
Listen...

271
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,186
- How's the helmet?
- Okay, it fits fine.

272
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,118
- Will it fly?
- Sooner than my enemies think.

273
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:54,662
So it does fly! Invite me,
and I'll bring a spoon to celebrate.

274
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,231
Olga.

275
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,694
Come out here for a moment.

276
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:13,108
Do me a favor. I'll pay you back
on Sunday. I'm closing a deal.

277
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:14,746
Lend me 1,000 lire.

278
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,513
- So you'll pay me back?
- Yeah.

279
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,322
You worked all night?

280
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:24,621
They should give you a raise.
I'll have a word with the boss.

281
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,760
- I only have 500.
- That's okay.

282
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,426
Thanks, Olga. See you.

283
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:35,131
Massimo and Leopoldo are off
to Bologna for the trotters.

284
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,774
I've got an inside tip.
Let's get a bet down.

285
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,342
A thousand would cover it.
I've got 300 - how about you?

286
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:46,751
<i>Now, even on Sundays,</i>
<i>the beach is deserted,</i>

287
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,543
<i>Still, we'd stare out to sea.</i>

288
00:24:54,626 --> 00:24:57,959
If you were offered 10,000 lire,
would you go in?

289
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:00,932
I would.

290
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:03,131
Let's go.

291
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,031
Let's go and watch Giudizio fish.

292
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,434
Come on, Riccardo.

293
00:25:10,442 --> 00:25:12,740
You know who Leopoldo looks like?
The priest!

294
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:19,605
Please don't tell Mama you saw me.

295
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,180
You said it was over with him.

296
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,375
Listen.

297
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,575
Let me go!

298
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:32,316
Quit staring, guys.

299
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,498
Come on,
let's go watch Giudizio fish.

300
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,283
Hi, Alberto.

301
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,257
- Look...
- We keep bumping into each other.

302
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,522
You're making me look like a jerk
in front of my friends.

303
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:16,963
Your friends mocking other people?
That's rich.

304
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,432
Ya gotta break up with that jerk!

305
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,435
What can you expect from him?

306
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,365
Nothing.

307
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,675
I don't expect anything.
- He's got a wife!

308
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,678
- Stop yelling! Mama's sleeping.
- He's married!

309
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:34,374
I know, but they're separated.

310
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:36,713
So what?
Is he gonna marry you?

311
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:39,685
Is he gonna marry you?
- Butt out, Alberto!

312
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,387
I can take care of myself.
I know what I should do.

313
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,725
- You work so you can do as you please?
- Yes.

314
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:51,592
No, you can't!

315
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:53,261
You're my sister!

316
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:55,063
Get your hands off me!

317
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,372
If you make Mama cry...

318
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,338
Get outta here, Alberto!

319
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:04,746
If you make Mama cry, I'll...

320
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,156
<i>Then, one day, when we'd just</i>
<i>about forgotten about him...</i>

321
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,024
Hey, guys!

322
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:20,993
It's Massimo.

323
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,929
- Guys! Fausto's back in town.
- He's really back?

324
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:27,263
- Yeah, and he's got a mustache!
- Where is he?

325
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,137
There he is!

326
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,636
- Hey, boys!
- Fausto, how's it going?

327
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:36,704
- How are you?
- Just great, thanks.

328
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,850
Hi, Alberto! We've been looking
for you for an hour.

329
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,488
Come over here, guys.
I've got something amazing to show you.

330
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,887
- What's that?
- It's a gramophone.

331
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:53,461
We saw Wanda Osiris.
- She was wonderful.

332
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:57,658
Sure, it was a nice show,
but let's not go overboard.

333
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,402
She came down this long staircase...

334
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,333
Quiet, quiet.
Just listen to this mambo.

335
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,001
There was a guy who danced like this.

336
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:26,161
- Teach me. Is it hard?
- Just follow me.

337
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,610
- Nice, isn't it?
- Are you happy?

338
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,837
Yes, very happy.

339
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:53,248
<i>Things would've gone on as usual</i>

340
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,894
<i>if Fausto's father-in-law</i>
<i>hadn't come up with a crazy idea.</i>

341
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,858
- Praise our Lord Jesus Christ.
- Forever and ever.

342
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:09,333
My good friend,
you get younger by the day.

343
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:12,441
How are you?

344
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:14,745
This must be your son-in-law.

345
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,244
Pleased to meet you.

346
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:19,314
Belated congratulations!

347
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,745
You're a lucky man.

348
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,148
Very lucky.

349
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,751
What's your name?
- Fausto Moretti.

350
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:32,160
Let me be absolutely candid.

351
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,063
This here is my establishment.
Somewhat small, perhaps...

352
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:38,696
You call this small?

353
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,861
Built through hard work.

354
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,974
Frankly, what I really need

355
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,271
is someone with experience:
A delivery man, handyman, stock boy.

356
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:52,710
Someone who can open
in the morning and close at night.

357
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:55,511
But I'd really prefer
to take you on instead.

358
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,314
- Thank the gentleman, Fausto.
- Thank you.

359
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,417
Don't mention it.

360
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:05,324
I'm pleased to give
a young man a start in life.

361
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:08,797
Feel right at home.
When can you start?

362
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,467
- Right now!
- Now?

363
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:13,501
Sure, you can start
learning the ropes.

364
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:17,163
Giulia, this is Sandra's husband.
He'll be working here now.

365
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,570
- Hello. The truck is here.
- I'll be right there.

366
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:22,075
Shouldn't he get one of these?

367
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:26,542
A work coat? I have an extra
he can use right over here.

368
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,676
- Just to keep the dust off.
- Here we are.

369
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,979
Wait, Giulia.

370
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,354
Try it on.

371
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:37,789
Mama'll make one just for you.

372
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,321
Something wrong?
It's just been cleaned.

373
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:44,231
Button up and tie the belt.

374
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,569
Looks like it was tailor-made for him.

375
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:52,242
Very nice.

376
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,406
Now, young man, you start work.

377
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:58,173
There are crates to unload.

378
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,079
Get the shipping log from my wife.

379
00:32:06,658 --> 00:32:09,786
And keep an eye on the men
or they'll break everything.

380
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,292
It's fragile stuff. Get going.

381
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,767
- There he is.
- What's he doing?

382
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:18,287
Come on, leave him alone.
He'll lose his job.

383
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,311
How are you? Welcome back.

384
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:37,343
- You look great.
- What a pretty hat.

385
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,774
- You just got back?
- Yesterday.

386
00:33:39,984 --> 00:33:43,647
- How's married life?
- Where's Fausto?

387
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,652
- He's got a job.
- He's working?

388
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:47,415
Yes, I'm on my way to meet him.

389
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:49,058
You're wise to keep an eye on him.

390
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:54,061
Why? Fausto's a good boy.
He's just a little fickle.

391
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,631
Do you like your new place?

392
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,426
We're staying with Mama for now.

393
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,332
Of course, you had so little time.

394
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,734
Everything was so rushed.

395
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:07,001
You're hardly showing at all.

396
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,270
It's still a long way off, isn't it?

397
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,142
- Sorry, I've got to run. Bye.
- Bye, dear.

398
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:16,276
Let's get together,
and bring Fausto too.

399
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,897
- I came to get you.
- Terrific!

400
00:34:33,871 --> 00:34:35,304
Watch this.

401
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,666
How's that?
- Bravo!

402
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:44,314
Fausto, not in public!

403
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,278
What's the big deal?
We're married.

404
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:49,146
Guess what.
Today I sold a statue this tall.

405
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:51,014
- Really?
- Yes.

406
00:34:51,122 --> 00:34:52,282
I'm so proud of you.

407
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,416
And now let's go to the movies.

408
00:34:55,626 --> 00:34:57,321
- Great!
- We have enough to get in?

409
00:34:57,528 --> 00:34:58,859
Yes, I've got it right here.

410
00:34:59,063 --> 00:35:00,826
That's my baby.

411
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:10,132
There's a couple of seats over there.

412
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:26,822
Is this okay?

413
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,423
Can you see?

414
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,486
- What a nice refrigerator.
- Soon we'll get one too.

415
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,128
How adorable.

416
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:41,268
Looking for your cigarettes?

417
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,638
Thanks. I've got matches.

418
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:48,245
Know what?
Papa really likes you.

419
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:52,280
This morning Mama told me

420
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:55,179
Papa is planning
an addition to the house.

421
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:58,150
But it's to be a surprise.
- Got it.

422
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,017
A light, please.

423
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:05,927
Thanks.

424
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,958
My pleasure.

425
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,539
- So we can live together.
- What?

426
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,209
So we can live together.

427
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,104
Sure.

428
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:34,353
<i>- Don't believe him, my dear.</i>
<i>- You mean I should trust you?</i>

429
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:37,084
<i>I knew he found me irritating.</i>

430
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,677
- Terrific, aren't they?
- Yeah, really good.

431
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,027
Excuse me for a minute.
Be right back. Hold my seat.

432
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,228
- You feeling okay?
- I'm fine. I'll be right back.

433
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:17,086
Ma'am.

434
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,595
Pardon me.

435
00:38:35,112 --> 00:38:36,704
Good evening, ma'am.

436
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,084
When will I see you again?
- What do you want?

437
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:44,812
- Your phone number.
- My number? Get lost.

438
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,048
Wait, don't shut the door.
I must talk to you.

439
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:58,499
- Are you out of your mind?
- I recognize you from the boardwalk.

440
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,797
This summer you wore
that white bathing suit.

441
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,632
So what?
I recognize you too.

442
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,167
You were with a young lady
at the movie theater.

443
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,503
Not me! When can I see you again?

444
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,579
Get out of here.
I'm a married woman.

445
00:39:12,116 --> 00:39:13,845
My maid is upstairs.

446
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:20,886
Let me see you.
Tomorrow night?

447
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,787
No. Never.

448
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,817
Day after tomorrow?

449
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,296
Then when?
- Whenever we meet again.

450
00:39:29,166 --> 00:39:31,134
Let's leave it to fate.
Good-bye.

451
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,331
Please, don't go yet.

452
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,932
I must speak with you.

453
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:38,107
Come back. Listen.

454
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:41,573
I've got to speak with you.
- Go away!

455
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,952
- Sandra, what are you doing here?
- Where were you?

456
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:32,458
I had promised to see a guy off
at the train station.

457
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:35,359
Am I late? Is the movie over?

458
00:40:35,566 --> 00:40:36,794
Too bad.

459
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:41,002
How'd it end? Did she die?
- No, she didn't.

460
00:40:41,205 --> 00:40:42,729
- So what happened?
- They got married.

461
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:46,603
What a fine actress. We saw her
in that movie when we were in Rome.

462
00:40:46,811 --> 00:40:48,244
What was the name of that picture?

463
00:40:48,579 --> 00:40:50,103
Sandra, are you crying?

464
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:53,916
Yes, you are. What's wrong?

465
00:40:55,219 --> 00:40:56,413
I'm scared.

466
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,212
Scared? Of what?

467
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,917
I don't know.
I'm just scared, Fausto.

468
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,117
I'm sorry.

469
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:14,069
Don't, Sandrina.

470
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:18,504
Don't worry. I'm being silly.
I just feel very sad.

471
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,940
Sandra, there's no reason.

472
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,341
I love you very much.

473
00:41:25,616 --> 00:41:27,675
Let me hold your little hand.

474
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:31,114
I feel better now, darling.

475
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,618
I can't stand to see you cry.

476
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:36,725
I won't cry anymore.
Just be near me.

477
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:38,622
I'll always be near you.

478
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,627
- Let's go home.
- Yes, let's.

479
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,067
<i>In the months that followed,</i>

480
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:57,714
<i>the most important events were</i>
<i>Riccardo's mustache - just like Fausto's -</i>

481
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,212
<i>and Alberto's sideburns.</i>

482
00:42:06,624 --> 00:42:09,320
<i>Fausto had, by now,</i>
<i>shaved his mustache.</i>

483
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:14,353
<i>Occasionally his father and sister</i>
<i>would pass by the shop</i>

484
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,661
<i>to see him at work.</i>

485
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:21,471
<i>Leopoldo worked as usual.</i>
<i>He, in turn, cultivated a goatee.</i>

486
00:42:21,672 --> 00:42:22,502
It's scary.

487
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:25,965
I thought you'd like it.

488
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:34,982
<i>And, at last, the eagerly awaited</i>
<i>carnival season.</i>

489
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,902
It'll be better this year.
People seem anxious to celebrate.

490
00:42:54,171 --> 00:42:56,401
Add a beauty mark on the other side.
- Nah, one's enough.

491
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:58,097
Is my dress ready?
- Yes.

492
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:03,474
Now leave me alone or your mother
will kill me. I have to do the sheets.

493
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:07,879
- I need bigger breasts.
- I padded it in front.

494
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:12,144
Look what he's done to himself,
such a good-looking boy.

495
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,916
- So, you're sweet on Alberto?
- What a mouth.

496
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:20,327
- Alberto, she's in love with you.
- Yeah, even Mama's noticed.

497
00:43:20,531 --> 00:43:23,398
- Is she really loaded?
- Why, do you want to marry her?

498
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:26,101
Elvira, my hat.

499
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:28,100
I don't have your hat.

500
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:30,796
So who's got it?
Hold this. Mama.

501
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:35,509
You're still here?
I'm ready to go now.

502
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,044
I'm not going.

503
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,772
Then let me have your hat.

504
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,143
Come on.
- You know I don't wear hats.

505
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:43,251
What am I gonna do?

506
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:49,418
It's just not fair. When you wanna
have a good time, no one helps.

507
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,427
Look in the trunk. You'll find something,
but don't make a mess.

508
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:58,097
What's up? Why's she crying?

509
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:02,902
What's wrong?
- Nothing. Just a slight headache.

510
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:08,644
You and I are gonna have it out.

511
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,446
Alberto, come and look.
This chest is full of stuff.

512
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,710
Don't mess things up.
Your mother will have a fit.

513
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:19,377
Riccardo, I'm sure these are
the right moves. Watch me.

514
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,182
Who's this bearded guy?

515
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:23,851
That's my poor old man.

516
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,525
Leopoldo, look at these pictures.

517
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:28,891
Here's the hat.

518
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,625
Look what I found.
- They're hilarious.

519
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,769
- Who is that?
- I don't have a clue.

520
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:35,666
What a kook!

521
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,773
Look at me.

522
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,192
Look at Alberto!

523
00:45:11,175 --> 00:45:12,767
Wanna dance?
- Yes, dear.

524
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:15,776
- Mama, we're gonna dance.
- Don't exert yourself.

525
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:20,110
Ever been up to the rafters
in this theater?

526
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:21,944
No, and I have no desire to.

527
00:45:29,093 --> 00:45:30,560
Leopoldo, wait for me!

528
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:34,389
What a coincidence -
we're both Chinese.

529
00:45:39,136 --> 00:45:41,104
I love you so much.

530
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,533
And I love you too.

531
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,140
- Why're you squeezing me?
- That's the Chinese way.

532
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,404
- I'm going to get a drink.
- The bar's that way.

533
00:46:00,157 --> 00:46:04,753
I'll bet that one day you'll come here
to see one of my plays.

534
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,691
I like variety shows.

535
00:46:06,897 --> 00:46:08,387
- What'll you have to drink?
- An orangeade.

536
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,625
- Antonio, an orangeade.
- An orangeade, right away!

537
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,432
Ever been up to the rafters
in this theater?

538
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:17,436
- Recognize me?
- Of course I do!

539
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,472
Here alone?
- No, with some girlfriends.

540
00:46:25,215 --> 00:46:26,876
Your costume is cute.

541
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:29,449
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

542
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:31,951
I made a last-minute decision
to come.

543
00:46:32,156 --> 00:46:33,589
We'll have a dance later.
- Sure.

544
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:35,054
Gisella, wait!

545
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:36,089
Who's he?

546
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:39,490
A great writer.
He's my neighbor, you know.

547
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,590
Whiskey, darling?

548
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,394
Whiskey? I want a sandwich.
A large one.

549
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,728
Antonio, a sandwich.

550
00:46:47,237 --> 00:46:49,262
Here, ma'am, just made.

551
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:50,838
Isn't this fun?

552
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,869
A glass of milk.
- Right away, sir.

553
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:57,440
Why the ham sandwich?

554
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,741
- Because it's good.
- You're always eating.

555
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:04,145
- I'm hungry.
- It doesn't look good!

556
00:47:15,399 --> 00:47:16,832
What a nice nose!

557
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,862
May I dance with my sister?

558
00:47:20,070 --> 00:47:21,298
Go right ahead.

559
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:22,995
Lose the sandwich!

560
00:47:25,609 --> 00:47:26,906
Come on.

561
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,348
I'm going to show her the rafters.

562
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,073
I'm starving.

563
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,185
- Cognac, Giulia?
- No, no. I'm feeling dizzy already.

564
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:38,352
Good evening.

565
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:41,555
Good evening.

566
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,459
Having fun?
- Lots. Aren't you?

567
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:52,730
Yeah.

568
00:47:53,804 --> 00:47:55,738
Listen, they're playing
the Sioux Mambo.

569
00:47:55,939 --> 00:47:59,534
- Yes, it's a beautiful song.
- May I?

570
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:03,469
Actually, I'm not alone.

571
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,978
- Giulia, listen.
- Good evening, sir.

572
00:48:06,183 --> 00:48:08,651
Why don't we go over
to the other spread?

573
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:10,117
Excuse me.

574
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:15,884
Two orangeades, Antonio.
Why that face?

575
00:48:16,093 --> 00:48:17,993
- Did you see Michele's wife?
- No, who?

576
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:22,962
My boss's wife. She's really classy.
Put it on my tab, Antonio.

577
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:40,372
I don't think you've got it right.

578
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,817
A master like me?

579
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,683
- What are you staring at?
- Nothing.

580
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:53,356
Where are you taking me?

581
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:02,468
- Look, it's breathtaking.
- I'm getting dizzy.

582
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:04,903
- Then don't look down.
- Now what?

583
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,407
Nothing.
Tomorrow we'll go for a drive.

584
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,944
- I'm not going.
- Of course you are.

585
00:49:11,148 --> 00:49:13,378
One more kiss on that lovely neck.

586
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:15,983
Please.

587
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:18,347
You're so annoying.

588
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:23,123
Stop, stop now.

589
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:19,273
Get out of here
with that damn trumpet!

590
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:29,483
Come with me, sweet little head.

591
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,550
Anita, come on.
Let's go to Mass.

592
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,873
Why won't you believe me?

593
00:51:55,345 --> 00:51:57,973
Alberto, what's wrong?
Feeling sick?

594
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,147
I'm okay.

595
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,545
- Come on, I'll take you home.
- I'm okay.

596
00:52:02,752 --> 00:52:05,118
Get out of here.
- Moraldo.

597
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,290
I'm taking you home.

598
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,482
Go to Peking, why don't you.

599
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:13,891
- Moraldo, leave him alone.
- I can't. He's a friend.

600
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,666
Come on.
- Let go, I'm okay.

601
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:27,571
- Hey, let's go swimming.
- Yeah, but home first.

602
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:30,302
- Okay, home first.
- And then we go swimming.

603
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:33,779
- Then we go swimming.
- We'll all go together.

604
00:52:35,185 --> 00:52:39,019
- Who the hell are you? Who?
- It's me, Moraldo.

605
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:44,850
No, you're nobody.
You're all nobodies.

606
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:51,725
What do you think you're doing?

607
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:55,927
- Nothing, nothing.
- You make me puke. Let me go.

608
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,903
But Alberto, if I let you go...

609
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:00,906
Let me go.
I wanna go by myself.

610
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:04,272
- Alberto, you'll get hurt.
- I want to go alone. I'll be okay.

611
00:53:04,481 --> 00:53:05,505
You're nothing.

612
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,148
- Alberto, look out, you'll fall.
- You make me puke.

613
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,950
- Moraldo, please, let's go.
- I can't just leave him.

614
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,886
May I come along now?
- Yeah, sure.

615
00:53:16,126 --> 00:53:17,286
Come on, come on.

616
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:22,194
What do you want with me?
- Nothing. Just keep walking.

617
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:24,393
Moraldo, know what?

618
00:53:26,670 --> 00:53:29,468
We gotta get married.
- Yes.

619
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,575
You see Fausto?

620
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:38,409
He settled down.
He's happy.

621
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,311
He has a house.
We just gotta get ourselves wives.

622
00:53:41,518 --> 00:53:42,849
Hey, Alberto!

623
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:48,120
You gotta get married, Riccardo.
You just gotta.

624
00:53:48,325 --> 00:53:50,020
Okay, bye.

625
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:51,888
See, I told him too.

626
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:59,293
You know what we'll do instead?

627
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,597
We'll go to Brazil.

628
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,472
We'll take her along.

629
00:54:04,674 --> 00:54:05,902
Yeah, right.

630
00:54:08,178 --> 00:54:10,043
Brazil... by boat.

631
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,981
Yeah, but first we go home.

632
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,949
You gonna leave me here?

633
00:54:18,154 --> 00:54:21,248
I can't just leave him.
You come too.

634
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,754
Alberto, you're home.
Do you want me to take you in?

635
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,429
I don't wanna go home.
What's there for me?

636
00:55:06,503 --> 00:55:08,994
I've been waiting for you.

637
00:55:09,205 --> 00:55:11,400
I wanted to say good-bye.

638
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,441
I'm leaving, Alberto. Forgive me.

639
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:17,044
I just couldn't take it anymore.

640
00:55:18,181 --> 00:55:19,978
Take care of Mama.

641
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,174
I'll always think of you.

642
00:55:25,522 --> 00:55:26,614
Good-bye.

643
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:29,889
Bye, Alberto.

644
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:37,633
Try to be sensible, Alberto.

645
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,208
Olga, where are you going?

646
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,808
Where's she going?

647
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:25,246
Mama, what's going on?

648
00:56:25,515 --> 00:56:29,042
You can see. She's gone.

649
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,653
How can my own daughter
do this to me?

650
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,723
After all I've sacrificed for her.

651
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:41,021
Don't cry, Mama.

652
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:47,226
I'll stay. I'll always be here.

653
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:52,607
You'll see, she'll change her mind
and come home. If not, better yet.

654
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:58,006
For the few pennies she gave us.

655
00:56:58,114 --> 00:56:59,877
Good riddance!

656
00:57:02,819 --> 00:57:05,515
I'll get a job.

657
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:09,790
- Really, Alberto? You will?
- Of course.

658
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,893
Have you found something?

659
00:57:13,129 --> 00:57:14,756
Have you found something?

660
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,514
- Good morning.
- See what that lady wants.

661
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:38,209
- What lady?
- That lady. Over there.

662
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,419
Hello. May I help you?

663
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:43,251
Two candles,
the kind I bought last year.

664
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,792
I wasn't here last year.

665
00:57:45,995 --> 00:57:47,986
She wants the same candles
she bought last year.

666
00:57:48,198 --> 00:57:50,166
So get them for her.
They're in the stockroom.

667
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,863
Sir.

668
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:54,664
Excuse me.

669
00:57:55,338 --> 00:57:56,600
Did you enjoy yourself last night?

670
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:01,539
Try to get here earlier.
It's 11:00. We open at 9:00.

671
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,541
My friend's sister ran away.

672
00:58:03,746 --> 00:58:06,010
Someone runs away every night.
You always have an excuse.

673
00:58:06,249 --> 00:58:08,114
- And I have a toothache.
- Get to work.

674
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,932
Giulia, see what's happened
back there.

675
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,567
I apologize.
Look at the craftsmanship.

676
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:33,769
- What happened?
- They fell.

677
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,976
Please, I'll take care of it.
I'm sorry.

678
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,764
- Well?
- Just paying you back.

679
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,529
Carnival is over.

680
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:17,116
You should always wear
what you did last night.

681
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:47,710
Hand me the receipts in that drawer.

682
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,316
Which drawer?

683
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:51,210
That drawer under the counter.

684
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:03,764
- The receipts you requested.
- Thank you.

685
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,468
What are you doing?
I got no sleep last night.

686
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:10,639
I waltzed with you
in my dreams, all night long.

687
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,308
- Put away these books, please.
- Give me a hand.

688
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:15,409
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

689
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,643
How passionate! Last night
I realized you're a real woman.

690
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:21,316
You must be drunk!

691
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:27,082
Yes, drunk with you,
your flesh, your scent.

692
01:00:28,057 --> 01:00:29,615
Enough! Stop this right now!

693
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,294
You trying to tell me
you don't like it?

694
01:00:46,075 --> 01:00:47,565
Please keep quiet about this.

695
01:00:48,444 --> 01:00:50,674
It's sunny, but quite chilly.

696
01:01:06,896 --> 01:01:09,729
Hello. Do you have
some angel ornaments?

697
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:23,602
- Good night, sir. I'll go out this way.
- Wait a minute.

698
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:31,053
Why not come up
and have a drink with us?

699
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:34,951
Today's our anniversary.
Fifteen years.

700
01:01:35,158 --> 01:01:37,991
Congratulations,
but I wouldn't want to intrude.

701
01:01:38,194 --> 01:01:41,095
On the contrary.
We'd love it.

702
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:45,734
If I'd known, I would've brought
flowers or something.

703
01:01:45,935 --> 01:01:47,425
Nonsense.

704
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:50,639
We live upstairs.
It's very convenient.

705
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,331
After you.
- Thank you.

706
01:02:00,817 --> 01:02:02,341
Allow me.

707
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,087
Come right in.

708
01:02:08,024 --> 01:02:10,993
Giulia, please bring
some vermouth.

709
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:15,259
Giulia, the vermouth.
- Yes, Michele.

710
01:02:15,465 --> 01:02:16,693
Have a seat.

711
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,692
- It's lovely.
- You like it?

712
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:22,166
- Really lovely.
- Modest, but we like it.

713
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,205
I'm about to get our place set up.

714
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:27,638
- Is that so?
- Is that a real antique?

715
01:02:27,844 --> 01:02:30,335
Yes. Here's the vermouth.

716
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:33,174
Evening, ma'am. Congratulations.
I hear it's your...

717
01:02:33,382 --> 01:02:36,249
Thank you. I've got to finish.

718
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,919
Go ahead, dear.

719
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:40,522
Go ahead.

720
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,057
My wife's a good woman, no?

721
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,319
Yes, very good, and...

722
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:47,427
And what?

723
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:48,964
A good woman.

724
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,729
Ah, yes.

725
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:55,231
We're not so young,
but we still get along well.

726
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,463
Since we have few friends,

727
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:01,031
we spend most evenings
in this room.

728
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,670
Sometimes we play cards.

729
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,214
That probably sounds dull
to you, no?

730
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:12,785
You'll find it amusing
that we play cards.

731
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:17,016
Sometimes I read
while my wife knits.

732
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:21,018
But we're not bored,
and do you know why?

733
01:03:21,831 --> 01:03:23,492
Because we really
love each other.

734
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,097
But you wouldn't understand.

735
01:03:28,237 --> 01:03:30,228
Of course I understand.

736
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,974
No, you don't.

737
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,905
- But I really do.
- No, you don't.

738
01:03:35,678 --> 01:03:37,669
I really pity you.

739
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:43,311
And I pity your poor wife even more.

740
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:45,384
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

741
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,380
This.
Here's your month salary.

742
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:52,550
Make up an excuse for your family.
Say you didn't like it. Too much work.

743
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,697
Give them any excuse.
You're really good at that.

744
01:03:56,399 --> 01:03:58,492
But why are you firing me?

745
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,498
So you'll learn to live right.

746
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:06,037
I treated you like a brother
and you acted like a cad!

747
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,572
Now get out of here,
before I wring your neck.

748
01:04:15,017 --> 01:04:17,349
I never expected this from you.

749
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:19,981
No, leave her out of this.

750
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:25,320
Giulia, Fausto's going.
He won't be working for us any longer.

751
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:27,453
He just quit.

752
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,029
So I shouldn't come in tomorrow?

753
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,094
Good evening.

754
01:04:38,908 --> 01:04:41,934
I was only kidding around, ma'am.

755
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,955
I lost my job

756
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:57,487
because of that silly woman,
my boss's wife.

757
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:58,853
Who's that?

758
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:04,192
She came on to me, but out of respect
for Michele, I turned her down.

759
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:08,496
She's an old lady. How could I go
for her? So she bad-mouthed me.

760
01:05:08,604 --> 01:05:10,936
And today he made up
some excuse to fire me.

761
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,974
- What excuse?
- Huh?

762
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,973
He just can't do that.
It's way too easy.

763
01:05:15,177 --> 01:05:19,307
Oh, he can and did. He said,
"Tell your family anything you like.

764
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:20,812
Find any excuse at all."

765
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:25,784
That's unfair. You shouldn't have left.
And no severance at all, nothing?

766
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:29,446
He should have given you notice -
a month at least.

767
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:31,022
No, no notice.

768
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,695
A month at least. He can't just
cheat you out of 30,000 lire.

769
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,525
One can't just do that today.
You work. You've got a job.

770
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:52,713
That was refreshing.

771
01:05:57,186 --> 01:05:59,017
Not drinking?
Aren't you thirsty?

772
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:04,717
Moraldo, can you keep a secret?

773
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:07,361
I don't know. Why?

774
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:10,899
My boss should've
given me notice, right?

775
01:06:12,201 --> 01:06:16,228
So I'm gonna get what's mine,
and we'll split it.

776
01:06:17,173 --> 01:06:18,401
I don't understand.

777
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:24,341
Would you be up
to pulling off a job?

778
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:26,979
- A job?
- You know.

779
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:30,780
- No. What do I have to do?
- Are you chicken?

780
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,319
- No.
- Then let's go.

781
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,087
Follow me.

782
01:06:54,176 --> 01:06:57,236
- Quiet.
- No, out of the way.

783
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,308
Where the hell are we?
- Quiet.

784
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,883
In the courtyard.

785
01:07:09,558 --> 01:07:11,685
Be careful. We don't want
to burn down the house.

786
01:07:24,306 --> 01:07:26,831
- Where are you?
- Over here.

787
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:31,173
What's that?

788
01:07:32,415 --> 01:07:33,382
Beautiful, isn't it?

789
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,514
- What is it?
- An angel.

790
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,186
Now we've gotta get it out.

791
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:43,619
You know how much it's worth?
40,000 lire. I saw the bill.

792
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:47,994
And you're stealing it?
Let's split, Fausto.

793
01:07:48,197 --> 01:07:52,827
It's not theft. It was unpacked
and got left here. It's been two months.

794
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:55,199
No one's noticed.
And you said I should've gotten notice.

795
01:07:55,304 --> 01:07:56,896
So we'll take this instead.

796
01:07:57,106 --> 01:07:58,471
But it's wrong.

797
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:07,175
Listen, Moraldo,
I have a family now. I need this.

798
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:10,112
I've got a lot of things
to take care of.

799
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:13,354
If you're scared, I'll go it alone.

800
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,816
At least give me some light here.

801
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,495
Look how beautiful.

802
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:32,266
Beautiful.

803
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,481
- Tell him to be quiet.
- Giudizio, cut it out!

804
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:08,635
Good morning, Sister.
Is Mother Superior in?

805
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:09,742
Why?

806
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,609
I'd like to discuss some business
I think she'd find in her interest.

807
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,975
What is it?
Mother Superior's in chapel now.

808
01:09:15,184 --> 01:09:15,843
Let's go.

809
01:09:17,386 --> 01:09:19,684
No, Moraldo, wait.
Let's show her.

810
01:09:20,556 --> 01:09:21,750
Show her.

811
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:31,365
An angel, solid wood. It's been
in our house, but we're forced to sell.

812
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:35,799
The Ursuline Convent
could have it for a reasonable price.

813
01:09:35,938 --> 01:09:38,133
Just look at that expression.

814
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,572
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel!

815
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:42,641
Don't be afraid.
He's harmless.

816
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,836
We already have
enough angels. Sorry.

817
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:46,575
Sister, listen.

818
01:10:00,262 --> 01:10:03,129
A brother, way up!

819
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,136
What do you want?

820
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:11,363
How are you today?
Would you like a cigarette?

821
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,008
Wait a moment. Here, catch.

822
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,068
Terrific.

823
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,282
It's lovely here. This is the life.

824
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:23,917
What's your name?

825
01:10:24,019 --> 01:10:25,748
- Father Felice.
- Is the Father Superior in?

826
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,183
No.

827
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,954
- So who's in charge in his absence?
- I am.

828
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:33,686
Wonderful. We have
a real bargain for you.

829
01:10:33,963 --> 01:10:38,491
A magnificent statue.
Colorful, perfect for the altar.

830
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:40,566
- Is that it?
- Yes.

831
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:45,803
Show it to him.

832
01:10:48,277 --> 01:10:50,677
Beautiful angel, beautiful angel!

833
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,006
Isn't it beautiful?
Look how expressive.

834
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:55,012
Where did you get it?

835
01:10:55,451 --> 01:10:57,476
It's from our house,
but we've got no place for it.

836
01:10:57,686 --> 01:11:00,211
We thought it would look
better in your church.

837
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:03,653
We have no need for it here.

838
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:14,831
<i>They were unable to sell</i>
<i>the statue that day.</i>

839
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:19,030
<i>So that evening, Fausto and</i>
<i>Moraldo entrusted it to Giudizio</i>

840
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:20,765
<i>with a thousand instructions.</i>

841
01:12:13,896 --> 01:12:15,227
Here's Papa.

842
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,063
Good evening, Papa.

843
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,570
Moraldo, come here.
Don't make me come after you!

844
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:27,198
- Papa, what did I do?
- You really have to ask?

845
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,735
Hoodlum! Cheat!
Wait till I get hold of you!

846
01:12:31,947 --> 01:12:32,936
I haven't done anything.

847
01:12:33,148 --> 01:12:35,412
What's the matter?
What's the poor boy done?

848
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:38,142
Poor boy! He's a monster!

849
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:43,553
We're all disgraced! Thieves!
Get out! Both of you!

850
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:44,716
What did they do?

851
01:12:44,860 --> 01:12:46,384
They stole a statue!

852
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,621
- No, Papa.
- Liars!

853
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:56,595
These two... I had to beg the police
not to arrest you in my home.

854
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,739
Yes, the police, in my own home!

855
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:05,703
And this pig tried to force himself
on the wife of my dearest friend.

856
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:21,520
A pack of lies! I'm shocked
you believed them! Very shocked!

857
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,095
And you dare raise your voice?

858
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:27,394
Yes, I will! You treat me like
a five-year old! I'm 30!

859
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:32,836
Keep your crummy food!
You'll never see me again! Never!

860
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:56,553
It wasn't his fault.
Giulia came on to him,

861
01:13:57,032 --> 01:13:58,966
then lied to her husband.

862
01:14:02,404 --> 01:14:04,201
Sandra, are you listening to me?

863
01:14:04,406 --> 01:14:05,430
Really?

864
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:09,737
Yeah. Fausto never encouraged her.

865
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,440
Wouldn't give her a second glance.

866
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:17,978
And then they wouldn't pay him.

867
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:22,085
So we took the statue.

868
01:14:24,426 --> 01:14:26,155
He really didn't make a pass at her?

869
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,090
I swear.

870
01:14:30,098 --> 01:14:32,123
Now stop crying.

871
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:40,199
Where is he now?

872
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,309
Out in the garden.

873
01:14:52,988 --> 01:14:54,649
I'm waiting for Moraldo.

874
01:14:54,857 --> 01:14:57,758
Tell Papa I'm leaving.
I don't want to be a burden.

875
01:14:58,427 --> 01:15:01,988
What are you saying?
Moraldo told me everything.

876
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,833
- What do you mean?
- Don't worry, I'll tell Papa

877
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:10,169
that that woman flirted with you.

878
01:15:13,775 --> 01:15:16,972
- Let's forget about it.
- No, they have to know the truth.

879
01:15:18,247 --> 01:15:22,513
Here, your cutlet.
You haven't eaten a thing.

880
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:30,458
Damn it!

881
01:15:31,326 --> 01:15:33,851
Why did you take the statue?

882
01:15:34,563 --> 01:15:38,294
Did you need money?
You should have told me, Fausto.

883
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:42,266
Why didn't you? There should be
no secrets between us.

884
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:46,703
We have to cling to each other.
All we have is each other.

885
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,503
Mama is very kind,

886
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:52,776
but she treats me like a baby.

887
01:15:52,981 --> 01:15:56,439
And Papa is always so busy.
He doesn't even know me.

888
01:15:56,785 --> 01:16:00,414
You're all I have, Fausto.
If you leave too...

889
01:16:09,431 --> 01:16:10,898
Sandra, don't.

890
01:16:15,837 --> 01:16:19,000
- Do you still love me, Fausto?
- Yes.

891
01:16:20,542 --> 01:16:25,809
- Do you love our baby?
- Sandra, my Sandrina, our baby.

892
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:30,275
So will you stay with me?

893
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:31,884
Yes.

894
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:37,215
Then come on home.
Let's go talk to Papa.

895
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:46,890
<i>So Fausto was forgiven and started</i>
<i>leisurely looking for another job.</i>

896
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:54,302
<i>They didn't pay him much attention</i>
<i>at home once the baby was born.</i>

897
01:16:54,509 --> 01:16:57,808
<i>A veritable Adonis,</i>
<i>he looked just like Mama, Papa,</i>

898
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:00,641
<i>Uncle, Grandfather, Grandmother</i>
<i>and even Moraldo.</i>

899
01:17:00,882 --> 01:17:04,682
He looks like my math teacher.
He's so ugly!

900
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:09,788
<i>Sandra was happy, and one day</i>
<i>she quietly took the baby</i>

901
01:17:09,992 --> 01:17:13,758
<i>to meet her father-in-law.</i>

902
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:16,157
- The coffee is almost ready.
- Good girl.

903
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:20,062
Moraldino, why are you so fat?

904
01:17:20,702 --> 01:17:23,432
Yesterday he said "blue."
I wonder what he meant.

905
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:26,130
Has Fausto found a job?

906
01:17:27,476 --> 01:17:31,913
I guess so.
He should start in a matter of days.

907
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,512
Excuse me, Papa.
I'll see about the coffee.

908
01:17:36,718 --> 01:17:38,845
- No, I'll go.
- Please, let me go.

909
01:17:39,054 --> 01:17:45,254
- Sandra, can I hold him?
- Be careful with him, Mirella.

910
01:17:46,194 --> 01:17:49,789
Come on, Moraldino,
give your auntie a kiss.

911
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,660
No, Papa, you don't know
how to hold him.

912
01:17:56,438 --> 01:17:58,099
That's no way to hold a baby.

913
01:17:58,373 --> 01:18:00,068
I don't know that one.

914
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:05,170
- Is that the farthest?
- Yes, it's called Sirius.

915
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:10,880
- Are there people living there?
- I don't think so.

916
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,550
- Would you live there?
- Yes.

917
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,814
- I don't believe you.
- Sure I would.

918
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,449
- Will you walk me home?
- Sure.

919
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:26,999
<i>The evenings were getting warmer.</i>
<i>Spring was in the air.</i>

920
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:56,259
<i>And now, a man whose heart</i>
<i>is as great as his name.</i>

921
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,397
That's him. He's brilliant.
Listen.

922
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:03,226
<i>Mr. Sergio Natali.</i>

923
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:16,707
I shall recite <i>Reminiscence of Youth.</i>

924
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:18,317
- Is that Natali?
- Yes.

925
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,680
He's uglier than sin.

926
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,546
Grandpa, when is Papa coming home?

927
01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:27,961
Little one,
your papa has already returned.

928
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,655
He's here, lost in the crowd.

929
01:19:31,967 --> 01:19:34,527
He's watching you, smiling at you.
He just brushed by you.

930
01:19:34,736 --> 01:19:37,534
And you, little one,
didn't feel a thing.

931
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,400
Why not, Grandpa?

932
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:43,577
Because you're innocent.

933
01:19:44,012 --> 01:19:49,678
Your papa left in the spring,
just like your grandpa.

934
01:19:50,952 --> 01:19:52,920
As a lieutenant, amid flowers,

935
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:58,483
songs and a flag.

936
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,729
<i>Leopoldo has long awaited</i>
<i>this evening.</i>

937
01:20:12,941 --> 01:20:15,239
<i>The great actor has read his play</i>

938
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:18,140
<i>and will see him in his dressing</i>
<i>room after the performance.</i>

939
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,756
<i>His big moment has come.</i>

940
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:39,022
<i>Even we grasped</i>
<i>the importance of this meeting,</i>

941
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,695
<i>and we were as excited</i>
<i>as Leopoldo.</i>

942
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:57,869
Ah, I see you've brought company.
Please, come in.

943
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:00,274
Please, come in.

944
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:03,781
Bring some chairs.
- That's all right, sir. We'll stand.

945
01:22:03,985 --> 01:22:05,748
Forgive the candle.

946
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:09,548
In these second-rate theaters,
they always steal the light bulbs.

947
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:12,727
- Of course, sir. It's nothing.
- May I offer you a cigarette?

948
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:15,887
They're domestic, you know.

949
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:19,396
American cigarettes
are very bad for you.

950
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:22,732
- Sir, I'm a great admirer.
- I saw you in <i>I due Foscari.</i>

951
01:22:24,039 --> 01:22:27,873
Yes, well, the best parts
were left on the cutting room floor.

952
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:31,568
Please, have a seat
while I finish removing my makeup.

953
01:22:35,183 --> 01:22:39,051
Sir, I've admired you for years.

954
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:42,849
I saw you for the first time
in Bologna, in 1943.

955
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:45,115
It was an unforgettable evening.

956
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:50,029
You revealed Ibsen to me.
- Ibsen. Those were the days.

957
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:51,630
Feels like yesterday.

958
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:55,866
Being principal actor
is hard work, my friend.

959
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:59,873
And you're seeing me during a break,
a vacation, I'd like to call it.

960
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:01,970
It's temporary, of course.

961
01:23:02,177 --> 01:23:03,166
Fausto, look who's here.

962
01:23:03,812 --> 01:23:07,805
Let me tell you,
I have great ideas for next season.

963
01:23:08,016 --> 01:23:11,144
I want to put together
an amazing cast.

964
01:23:11,353 --> 01:23:14,186
A cast that will make history.

965
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,949
I might be able to get Ferrati,
and perhaps even Gassman.

966
01:23:17,492 --> 01:23:19,892
Did you hear that?
He's gonna get Ferrati and Gassman.

967
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:24,258
I want young playwrights, both
for the grants and for the challenge.

968
01:23:24,466 --> 01:23:25,831
By the way,

969
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:28,030
I read your piece.

970
01:23:29,070 --> 01:23:31,004
Skimmed it, really.

971
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:35,167
You understand, I'm always so busy.
The theater is a tyrant.

972
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,944
But you've got it.

973
01:23:38,146 --> 01:23:40,808
You really liked it?

974
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:45,552
You've got it here... and here.

975
01:23:46,287 --> 01:23:47,686
Sir.

976
01:23:49,524 --> 01:23:52,152
"I'm a product of my time.
I am, alas, powerless.

977
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,661
Do you understand, Frida,
the writhing agony of my soul?"

978
01:23:55,764 --> 01:23:57,561
Frida laughs.

979
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,326
"I understand, Roberto,
that you are consumed by pride..."

980
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:00,833
Salt.

981
01:24:00,935 --> 01:24:02,698
"...by your being. Roberto laughs.

982
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:06,940
What more damage can pride do
to a soul already ruined?

983
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:09,408
Blind man!
Only fear could save you."

984
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:14,013
Blind man!
Only fear could save you.

985
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:17,177
Brilliant! But that was Frida's line.
She goes on.

986
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:21,114
"In the silence of your desert,
don't you hear a voice calling you?"

987
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,347
Robert, ironic: "Your voice, Frida?"

988
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:25,583
"No... God's."

989
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,728
So ends Act II.

990
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,030
Beautiful.
Don't you think it's good?

991
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,862
- I like it.
- May I start Act III?

992
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,665
- Go on.
- Act III, Scene I.

993
01:24:41,476 --> 01:24:42,465
The door!

994
01:24:42,577 --> 01:24:44,238
I'll close it.

995
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,810
Waiter, what have you got?

996
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:50,915
- Have you eaten, sir?
- May I go on, sir?

997
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,552
Very well, thank you.

998
01:24:52,754 --> 01:24:55,314
- Of course, read on.
- Act III, Scene I.

999
01:25:02,630 --> 01:25:05,098
What's the omelet Romagnola?
The one with all that grease?

1000
01:25:06,301 --> 01:25:09,099
- It's our specialty, with béchamel.
- All right, I'll have that.

1001
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,229
Ask Mr. Natali to introduce us.

1002
01:25:12,140 --> 01:25:13,107
Why not?

1003
01:25:15,844 --> 01:25:18,506
They'll be represented
by two figures clad in white.

1004
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:24,074
Black light will give the scene
a nightmarish quality.

1005
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:26,346
The wind from time to time
will carry in the cry of the gulls.

1006
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:28,945
As if shaken by a sudden shiver,
Frida turns.

1007
01:25:29,090 --> 01:25:32,924
She looks tired, aged. She approaches
him. "There will be no moon tonight."

1008
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:35,153
I like you, baby.

1009
01:25:35,263 --> 01:25:37,731
And if you're not drinking with me,
damn you to hell!

1010
01:25:40,435 --> 01:25:43,268
- Can you do Gary Cooper?
- Alberto, do the saw.

1011
01:25:43,471 --> 01:25:46,201
I do a good saw.
But you've got to close your eyes.

1012
01:25:46,708 --> 01:25:48,198
Be quiet and listen!

1013
01:25:50,545 --> 01:25:52,604
My turn to do an impression.

1014
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:56,250
My grandmother.
- Granny, I'll never leave you.

1015
01:25:56,584 --> 01:26:00,281
Can't you do impressions?
Why are you so serious?

1016
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:03,785
I like this dark-haired boy.
He's got class.

1017
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:05,417
That's true.

1018
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:11,694
"No, not even crime horrifies me now.
Yet I can remember..."

1019
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:18,200
Hey, there's a radio here.
I'm gonna turn it on.

1020
01:26:18,373 --> 01:26:21,706
That's a naughty thing to say.

1021
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,241
Leopoldo, where are you going?

1022
01:26:55,343 --> 01:26:58,244
I'll tell you later.
I feel poetically inspired.

1023
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:00,505
An idea worthy of a genius!

1024
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,541
An ocean breeze, a night wind.

1025
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:08,952
- Sir, my friends...
- Your friends disappoint me.

1026
01:27:10,425 --> 01:27:13,792
He who cares not for art
cares not for life.

1027
01:27:14,429 --> 01:27:16,158
Is the beach that way?
- Yes, sir.

1028
01:27:16,364 --> 01:27:17,991
Excellent!

1029
01:27:18,266 --> 01:27:21,429
Let's use first names -
we're both artists, after all!

1030
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:23,962
Your Frida is wonderful.
She's marvelous.

1031
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:28,031
What a well-sculpted character.
Perfect for Ferrati!

1032
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:34,110
Excellent! I'll write to her tonight.
She'll be thrilled.

1033
01:27:34,782 --> 01:27:38,718
If Act IV is anything like
the first two you read me,

1034
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,420
I can tell you we have
a guaranteed success on our hands.

1035
01:27:44,192 --> 01:27:46,558
What's your name?
- Poldo, sir.

1036
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:50,097
Leopoldo, in two months
you must come with me to Milan.

1037
01:27:50,198 --> 01:27:53,929
- Really, sir? Are you serious?
- Call me Sergio.

1038
01:27:54,135 --> 01:27:58,094
- Sir, are you serious?
- Come, Leopoldo. Let's read Act IV.

1039
01:27:58,206 --> 01:28:01,141
Sir, you have no idea
what this means to me.

1040
01:28:01,342 --> 01:28:04,641
I was ready to give up
on all my dreams.

1041
01:28:05,079 --> 01:28:07,479
- Is the beach this way?
- This way, sir.

1042
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:13,111
Sergio, I can hardly express...
This town is blind to art.

1043
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:15,189
It's so hard,
being perpetually misunderstood.

1044
01:28:15,290 --> 01:28:18,088
My friends don't even understand me.
They only care about material things.

1045
01:28:18,192 --> 01:28:20,717
They live their sordid lives,
thinking of women and money.

1046
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:24,161
I feel so alone.
And the winter is awful.

1047
01:28:24,365 --> 01:28:27,857
It's endless in this town.
I'm so full of sadness and anguish.

1048
01:28:28,069 --> 01:28:32,369
At midnight the town goes dark.
How can an artist feed his demons?

1049
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:34,131
How can he live in this silence?

1050
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:38,611
The years go by,
then one morning you wake up.

1051
01:28:38,713 --> 01:28:40,977
Just yesterday you were a boy,
and now you're no longer young.

1052
01:28:41,082 --> 01:28:42,606
My hat!

1053
01:28:43,084 --> 01:28:47,817
But that's all over now. In two months
I'll go to Milan, Genoa, anywhere.

1054
01:28:48,456 --> 01:28:52,187
I knew I shouldn't give up.
I knew I'd find my way,

1055
01:28:52,293 --> 01:28:54,523
that one day you'd come along.

1056
01:28:57,865 --> 01:28:59,389
Where are you?

1057
01:29:08,843 --> 01:29:12,540
The wind has died down.
Is that the pier?

1058
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,246
Come and read me Act IV.

1059
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:19,250
Sir - Sergio, where are you going?

1060
01:29:19,454 --> 01:29:21,183
We'll find a spot down there.

1061
01:29:22,724 --> 01:29:24,692
But it's dark down there.

1062
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:33,356
Come.

1063
01:29:35,737 --> 01:29:37,102
Come.

1064
01:29:39,974 --> 01:29:42,272
You aren't afraid of me, are you?

1065
01:29:48,316 --> 01:29:52,047
Poldo, where are you going?
I was joking.

1066
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:56,283
What did you think I meant?
Come back here, Poldo.

1067
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:19,010
Bye.

1068
01:30:20,815 --> 01:30:22,373
Bye, baby.

1069
01:30:22,683 --> 01:30:24,708
Don't catch cold.

1070
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:29,520
I'll come to the station
in the morning to see you off.

1071
01:30:42,136 --> 01:30:43,865
What are you doing here?

1072
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:49,437
- I was waiting for you.
- Good for you. Thanks.

1073
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:51,839
I think it's better
if we go home together.

1074
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,441
Of course.

1075
01:30:56,818 --> 01:30:58,809
Man, what a woman!

1076
01:30:59,086 --> 01:31:02,613
You know what she told me?
If I could sing, she'd hire me.

1077
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,723
Honest. She was going
to take me on tour.

1078
01:31:05,893 --> 01:31:07,485
It's not a bad life.

1079
01:31:07,695 --> 01:31:11,529
You travel, you're free,
you have fun, no worries.

1080
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,162
Always surrounded by women.

1081
01:31:22,710 --> 01:31:24,177
What about you?

1082
01:31:25,446 --> 01:31:26,936
What about me? Nothing.

1083
01:31:27,348 --> 01:31:29,578
Why not?
She really wasn't bad-looking.

1084
01:31:30,952 --> 01:31:32,544
What's wrong with you?

1085
01:31:35,056 --> 01:31:36,614
Nothing. I was just thinking.

1086
01:31:37,258 --> 01:31:38,691
About what?

1087
01:31:39,227 --> 01:31:40,387
Sandra.

1088
01:31:41,596 --> 01:31:45,191
What's she got to do with this?
You gonna preach to me now?

1089
01:31:46,267 --> 01:31:48,292
Is that why you waited for me?

1090
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:51,935
Answer me.

1091
01:31:57,445 --> 01:31:58,605
Good night.

1092
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:01,739
You've still got lipstick
on your face.

1093
01:32:02,483 --> 01:32:04,007
Other side.

1094
01:32:32,813 --> 01:32:34,474
Sandra, aren't you asleep yet?

1095
01:32:35,583 --> 01:32:37,676
Look at that little face.
- Don't touch him!

1096
01:32:39,120 --> 01:32:40,417
Why not?

1097
01:32:42,156 --> 01:32:44,181
Are you crying?
- Go away. Get out.

1098
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:47,125
- What did I do?
- Go away.

1099
01:32:47,228 --> 01:32:48,627
Sandrina.

1100
01:32:49,430 --> 01:32:51,557
- Don't touch me.
- You'll wake the baby.

1101
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,228
Tell me what I did, at least.

1102
01:33:38,512 --> 01:33:41,913
<i>That morning, Sandra left the house</i>
<i>at dawn without a word to anyone...</i>

1103
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:45,744
<i>and at noon</i>
<i>she still hadn't come back.</i>

1104
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:50,422
Here comes Riccardo
with Papa's car.

1105
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,587
Hi, Riccardo. Hi, Alberto.
Get in, Fausto.

1106
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:55,523
Hi, Fausto.

1107
01:33:56,263 --> 01:33:58,788
Moraldo went to see Miss Rossi,
Sandra's old teacher.

1108
01:33:58,899 --> 01:34:00,594
She might have gone to see her.

1109
01:34:00,701 --> 01:34:02,464
That's right, Fausto.

1110
01:34:02,570 --> 01:34:04,629
I think she might be there.

1111
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:08,133
Let's go to the school
and then to her nanny's.

1112
01:34:08,509 --> 01:34:11,205
How far to the nanny's?
What about the gas?

1113
01:34:21,288 --> 01:34:23,779
What happened?
Did you have a fight?

1114
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:36,297
Well?

1115
01:34:37,238 --> 01:34:39,035
She hasn't seen her.

1116
01:34:41,642 --> 01:34:43,507
Get in.
Let's go to the nanny's.

1117
01:34:44,578 --> 01:34:47,012
You go ahead.
I'll look for her on my own.

1118
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:51,215
What's happened to her?

1119
01:34:51,318 --> 01:34:52,683
Nothing, miss.

1120
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,017
Forget about him. Let's go.

1121
01:35:06,834 --> 01:35:11,498
Leopoldo, how about before
we leave town we grab a bite to eat?

1122
01:35:12,206 --> 01:35:14,504
We could grab a bite to eat
before we leave town.

1123
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:15,939
Shut up!

1124
01:35:16,777 --> 01:35:19,371
I think we'll find her at the nanny's.

1125
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:20,606
I'm sure of it.

1126
01:35:20,815 --> 01:35:22,715
She went to show her
the baby. You'll see.

1127
01:35:22,917 --> 01:35:26,080
That's what I think.
She went to show her the baby.

1128
01:35:28,322 --> 01:35:31,086
Did you have anything to eat
before you left the house?

1129
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:33,951
Nothing at all?
- I'm not hungry.

1130
01:35:34,061 --> 01:35:35,926
- A sandwich, maybe...
- I'm not hungry.

1131
01:35:48,676 --> 01:35:50,871
- Where are we supposed to turn?
- Let's get out.

1132
01:35:52,279 --> 01:35:56,010
- Let's ask for directions.
- Ask who? There's nobody here.

1133
01:35:56,684 --> 01:35:58,515
There's a house down there.

1134
01:35:58,686 --> 01:36:02,087
There's no one there.
This is a wasteland.

1135
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:06,959
Fausto, where are you going?

1136
01:36:08,629 --> 01:36:11,689
- Watch Leopoldo.
- Go ahead, do it.

1137
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:18,066
- Hey, you could have hit me.
- Don't look at me. It was him.

1138
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:21,566
Quiet.
Did you hear the pipit?

1139
01:36:22,610 --> 01:36:23,838
- What?
- The pipit.

1140
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:25,375
That's no pipit.
That's a robin.

1141
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:28,241
That's no robin.
Robins sound like this...

1142
01:36:31,218 --> 01:36:33,049
How do robins sound?

1143
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:35,085
Robins sound like this...

1144
01:36:51,639 --> 01:36:56,508
<i>But Sandra wasn't at the nanny's either.</i>
<i>Fausto was getting scared.</i>

1145
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,473
- What happened?
- Riccardo.

1146
01:36:59,947 --> 01:37:02,438
We have to go back right away.
- The car won't start.

1147
01:37:02,650 --> 01:37:04,948
We'll have to take
the carburetor apart.

1148
01:37:07,721 --> 01:37:10,019
- May I borrow that bicycle?
- Of course, dear boy.

1149
01:37:10,224 --> 01:37:12,920
It belongs to Cesare,
but he won't need it today. Be careful.

1150
01:37:13,027 --> 01:37:15,222
Would you like something to eat?
An omelet with bacon, maybe.

1151
01:37:15,329 --> 01:37:17,126
- Wait. Where are you going?
- Get out of my way.

1152
01:37:17,298 --> 01:37:19,596
Listen, Fausto.
Sandra is at home. I'm sure of it.

1153
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,168
I'll bet you anything
that she's at home.

1154
01:37:22,269 --> 01:37:24,669
- Cut it out. Out of my way.
- Now you feel guilty?

1155
01:37:24,772 --> 01:37:27,240
It took you long enough.
- Out of my way, idiot!

1156
01:37:27,341 --> 01:37:29,502
Worry about that sister of yours
who never came back!

1157
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:32,636
Dirty rotten coward!
Lecher!

1158
01:37:38,686 --> 01:37:40,244
- You mentioned an omelet?
- Yes.

1159
01:37:40,454 --> 01:37:43,480
- With bacon. Albertone.
- Leave me alone.

1160
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,159
- With bacon.
- With bacon?

1161
01:38:10,284 --> 01:38:12,946
- Isn't anybody home?
- They're at the police station.

1162
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,314
They're looking for her
at the beach.

1163
01:38:16,557 --> 01:38:17,785
At the beach?

1164
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:21,223
Why would they do that?

1165
01:38:21,428 --> 01:38:23,293
I don't know.

1166
01:38:28,168 --> 01:38:31,604
What should I do?
Should I start making lunch?

1167
01:38:40,247 --> 01:38:41,805
It's you.

1168
01:38:43,050 --> 01:38:45,416
See? We meet again.

1169
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:47,444
It's fate.

1170
01:38:48,489 --> 01:38:50,753
What's the matter?
Why haven't you shaved?

1171
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:54,052
Where are you going
in such a hurry? The movies?

1172
01:38:54,261 --> 01:38:56,320
I'm going home.

1173
01:38:57,031 --> 01:39:00,194
Would you be a gentleman
and carry this for me?

1174
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:03,495
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
I really can't.

1175
01:39:37,638 --> 01:39:38,935
Is she back?

1176
01:39:43,110 --> 01:39:45,601
If she doesn't come back,
I'll kill myself!

1177
01:39:46,647 --> 01:39:50,208
You'll never kill yourself.
You're a coward.

1178
01:39:53,687 --> 01:39:56,485
Moraldo, listen.

1179
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:25,213
Mr. Michele.

1180
01:40:30,758 --> 01:40:32,157
What's the matter?

1181
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:35,722
Sandrina has disappeared.

1182
01:40:46,373 --> 01:40:48,273
Hey, workers.

1183
01:40:52,312 --> 01:40:54,678
Stupid workers!

1184
01:40:57,951 --> 01:41:00,886
- What's up with this car?
- Hey, why are you stopping?

1185
01:41:00,988 --> 01:41:04,549
- Get out. Open the hood.
- What do you want me to do?

1186
01:41:05,959 --> 01:41:08,484
Let me out.

1187
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:10,492
Look at him. He's asleep.
- Hurry up.

1188
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:16,233
They're coming.

1189
01:41:16,503 --> 01:41:18,232
Hey, we were only joking!

1190
01:41:23,277 --> 01:41:24,608
What's going on?

1191
01:41:26,647 --> 01:41:29,616
What did I do? I was asleep.

1192
01:41:29,716 --> 01:41:31,308
I'm a socialist.
- Socialist?

1193
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:33,318
You're not even a man!

1194
01:41:44,098 --> 01:41:46,191
- Are you looking for Sandra?
- Yes.

1195
01:41:46,467 --> 01:41:49,061
She's been here with us all day.

1196
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:02,748
Hold it right there.

1197
01:42:06,019 --> 01:42:08,852
Sandra, take the baby
in the other room.

1198
01:42:09,056 --> 01:42:12,287
- Papa, it's all right.
- Please, go in the other room.

1199
01:42:16,897 --> 01:42:21,095
You too, Mirella.
- Please, Papa, let me stay.

1200
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:25,266
What a day, Papa.

1201
01:42:36,316 --> 01:42:38,614
Papa, what are you doing?

1202
01:42:39,119 --> 01:42:41,849
- You hear that?
- No, I can't hear a thing.

1203
01:42:41,955 --> 01:42:43,684
He's beating him!
Let me go in there!

1204
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:45,815
They're just arguing.
A little loudly, but they're men.

1205
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:47,618
He's hurting him.

1206
01:42:47,728 --> 01:42:48,922
Please, Papa!

1207
01:42:49,796 --> 01:42:51,286
Leave them alone.
They're just playing.

1208
01:42:52,432 --> 01:42:55,731
No, Papa, no!

1209
01:42:55,836 --> 01:42:58,566
Let me go in there.
Can't you hear them yelling?

1210
01:42:58,672 --> 01:43:02,540
- Don't worry, it's nothing.
- Mirellina, he'll kill him.

1211
01:43:08,282 --> 01:43:10,648
- He's beating him to a pulp.
- I don't think he's hurting him.

1212
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:13,319
On the contrary...

1213
01:43:15,222 --> 01:43:18,020
Please hold the baby.
I have to go in there.

1214
01:43:19,393 --> 01:43:21,418
Papa, enough!

1215
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:44,373
Allow me to shake your hand.
Michele Corti's the name.

1216
01:43:45,586 --> 01:43:47,076
It's an honor.

1217
01:43:48,288 --> 01:43:51,155
- You really gave me a scare.
- Did he hurt you, darling?

1218
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:53,658
No. How are you?

1219
01:44:05,372 --> 01:44:06,862
Good night, Papa.

1220
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:23,619
You scared me so, Sandra.
Never do that again, you hear?

1221
01:44:24,191 --> 01:44:27,991
And if you make me mad again,
I'll beat you like your father.

1222
01:44:28,528 --> 01:44:29,961
But even harder.

1223
01:44:31,064 --> 01:44:32,861
I'll beat you senseless.

1224
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:35,425
That's how I like you!

1225
01:44:37,571 --> 01:44:39,038
Let me hold the baby.

1226
01:44:41,575 --> 01:44:44,772
- Don't let him catch cold.
- Look, Mirellina is at the window.

1227
01:44:45,078 --> 01:44:46,670
Bye, Mirella.

1228
01:44:54,187 --> 01:44:57,486
<i>Fausto and Sandra's story</i>
<i>ends here for now.</i>

1229
01:44:58,592 --> 01:45:01,493
<i>As for Leopoldo,</i>
<i>Alberto, Riccardo</i>

1230
01:45:01,695 --> 01:45:05,563
<i>and the rest of us,</i>
<i>you can imagine what happened.</i>

1231
01:45:06,767 --> 01:45:08,735
<i>We all talked about leaving,</i>

1232
01:45:09,236 --> 01:45:13,502
<i>but only one of us, one morning,</i>
<i>without a word to a soul,</i>

1233
01:45:13,907 --> 01:45:15,340
<i>actually left.</i>

1234
01:45:55,215 --> 01:45:57,683
- Are you leaving?
- Guido.

1235
01:45:58,151 --> 01:46:00,346
- Yes, I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

1236
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:04,182
I don't know. I'm leaving.

1237
01:46:04,291 --> 01:46:06,384
All aboard.

1238
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:08,291
All clear.

1239
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:14,195
- Why are you leaving then?
- I don't know.

1240
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:15,993
I have to go away. I'm leaving.

1241
01:46:16,103 --> 01:46:18,162
Didn't you like it here?

1242
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:24,033
Good-bye, Moraldo.

1243
01:46:26,313 --> 01:46:27,837
Good-bye, Guido.
