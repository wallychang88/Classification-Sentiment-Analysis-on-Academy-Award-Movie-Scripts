1
00:04:10,172 --> 00:04:12,538
Lucy, what is it?

2
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:17,010
Look, it's Jesus!
Where are they going?

3
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,982
Look, look. It's coming down.

4
00:04:46,214 --> 00:04:49,775
What's going on with that statue?
Where are you taking it?

5
00:04:54,024 --> 00:04:58,393
- What?
- Where are you taking it?

6
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:03,462
To the pope,

7
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,396
They're taking it to the pope!

8
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,872
They want the phone number. No!

9
00:06:09,882 --> 00:06:12,510
Hey, kid, come here.

10
00:06:13,419 --> 00:06:16,047
Listen, what did they eat
at table 16?

11
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:18,687
The prince ate snails.

12
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:21,357
- What kind of wine did they have?
- Soave.

13
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:26,090
Excuse me, Mr. Giulio, I saw them
myself. They had Valpolicella.

14
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,565
- Hi, Marcello.
- Hi, Pierone.

15
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:31,969
So snails and Valpolicella.
Giulio, let me take a picture.

16
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,904
It's not possible, my friend.

17
00:06:34,111 --> 00:06:38,480
Why do you give him all that money?
If you want information, I'm always here.

18
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:01,473
Manager!
Manager, stop that photographer!

19
00:07:04,181 --> 00:07:07,048
- Give me the film!
- Oh, come on. The camera is empty.

20
00:07:07,251 --> 00:07:09,913
Everyone has a right
to their own image.

21
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:13,850
Can you give me a light?

22
00:07:25,004 --> 00:07:27,973
- Listen, darling, come here.
- Me?

23
00:07:28,176 --> 00:07:29,768
- Yes.
- What's the matter?

24
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:31,536
I must talk to you. Come.

25
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,584
Good evening, how are you?

26
00:07:37,687 --> 00:07:39,484
- Well?
- Sit down.

27
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,954
- Where? There's no chair.
- Squat down.

28
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:47,026
- Sorry.
- Naughty boy.

29
00:07:47,499 --> 00:07:50,297
- Why?
- Because you're a naughty boy.

30
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,738
And you know what I'll do?
I'll break your little face.

31
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:59,603
I have to inform the public, it's my job.
After all, it's just a little publicity.

32
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:03,113
You call that publicity? You got her
in trouble with her husband.

33
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:07,050
Do I worry about your being cuckolded?

34
00:08:07,255 --> 00:08:10,315
- You're not a journalist.
- Great journalism.

35
00:08:10,727 --> 00:08:15,687
- Shut up. Don't overdo it.
- You'll kill me.

36
00:08:27,781 --> 00:08:30,215
- Has he arrived?
- No, miss, he didn't show up yet.

37
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:34,410
When he arrives, tell him he's an idiot.
Give me a whiskey.

38
00:08:37,091 --> 00:08:40,390
I can't believe this place is still open.
It's unbearable!

39
00:09:26,952 --> 00:09:29,546
Good evening, Maddalena.
How are you? Alone?

40
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:32,556
- Would you like to dance?
- No.

41
00:09:34,293 --> 00:09:35,783
Shall we have some vodka?

42
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:39,458
No. Everything's going wrong tonight.
I'm leaving.

43
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:42,533
- May I accompany you?
- Why not.

44
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:12,437
- Your friends are ready to attack.
- Marcello, where are you going?

45
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,501
- Miss Maddalena!
- Please, leave me alone tonight.

46
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:19,471
Welcome back. Here she is.
More photogenic than a star!

47
00:10:19,947 --> 00:10:23,212
Every night the same story.
Don't they ever get bored?

48
00:10:23,419 --> 00:10:25,114
Paparazzo, enough!

49
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:28,313
You should be used to it by now.
You're a public figure.

50
00:10:28,525 --> 00:10:31,858
Marcello, where are you going?
Tell us where you're taking her.

51
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:39,694
I

52
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,808
I'd like to live in a new city.
Where I don't know anyone.

53
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,881
Personally, I like Rome very much.

54
00:10:51,085 --> 00:10:56,387
It's sort of a moderate, tranquil jungle
where one can hide well.

55
00:10:59,228 --> 00:11:02,857
I'd like to hide too, but I can't.
I can't.

56
00:11:06,805 --> 00:11:10,104
- What are we going to do now?
- Take a ride. Stay here.

57
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:20,243
I'm fed up even with Rome.
I'd like an island.

58
00:11:20,454 --> 00:11:21,853
Buy one.

59
00:11:22,189 --> 00:11:23,417
I thought about it.

60
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,450
But then, would I really go there?

61
00:11:28,997 --> 00:11:32,091
You know what your problem is?
You have too much money.

62
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,632
And your problem
is you don't have enough.

63
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,432
Meanwhile, here we are,
the two of us.

64
00:11:40,378 --> 00:11:45,281
That's not a problem. We're among
the few people left to be unhappy.

65
00:11:45,484 --> 00:11:48,214
- What happened to you there?
- Nothing.

66
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:53,118
You shouldn't worry. You're so rich,
if you fall, you'll land on your feet.

67
00:11:53,327 --> 00:11:55,124
- You really think so?
- Oh, yes.

68
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,592
I can't even stand on my feet.

69
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:02,797
I'd need a sort of charge to stand
on my own that I don't have.

70
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:07,465
When I make love...
Yes, with love there is this tension.

71
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:11,239
- Only love gives me strength.
- Long live love, then!

72
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:15,044
Annamaria, come and look!

73
00:12:15,552 --> 00:12:17,850
That's not a car, it's an apartment.

74
00:12:18,056 --> 00:12:21,787
- Who are you? Liliana?
- No, I'm not Liliana.

75
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:24,963
- And who are you?
- Good evening.

76
00:12:25,597 --> 00:12:28,430
- Good evening.
- Who are you talking to?

77
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:30,633
Who's there?

78
00:12:31,137 --> 00:12:34,368
Liliana's not here anymore.
She went to Milan.

79
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,843
Do you want to take a ride with us?

80
00:12:37,045 --> 00:12:39,411
- Me?
- Yes.

81
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:41,282
Come along.

82
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:47,182
This lady is asking if I can go
for a ride with her. Should I?

83
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:50,852
Let's take a ride with this girl.

84
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:53,761
What exactly do you want to do?

85
00:12:53,966 --> 00:12:58,369
Nothing. We'll go for a ride and then
we'll take her home. You know her?

86
00:12:58,638 --> 00:12:59,605
No.

87
00:13:01,075 --> 00:13:03,043
At least, I don't think so.

88
00:13:04,512 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm going to eat.
I'll see you there.

89
00:13:07,281 --> 00:13:10,910
- Here they are.
- Turn off the lights, you fanatic!

90
00:13:13,989 --> 00:13:17,049
Get some good money.
These guys are richer than Onassis.

91
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,661
Are you coming with us?

92
00:13:21,866 --> 00:13:25,165
If you could take me home,
I'd appreciate it.

93
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:28,831
- Are you coming?
- Nope.

94
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:32,207
But I live kind of far.

95
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:37,344
- Sit in the back. Can you fit?
- Yes. Thanks.

96
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,380
- Are you okay there?
- Yes, yes.

97
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:42,748
- Bye, hon!
- Bye, Annamaria.

98
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:45,288
- Where do you live?
- At Cessati Spiriti.

99
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,271
- Whose car is this? Is it yours?
- Yes.

100
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:04,039
- Did you buy it for her?
- Her father.

101
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:08,019
My goodness! All my father
gave me were beatings.

102
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:11,418
- Do you know my father?
- You introduced him to me once.

103
00:14:12,293 --> 00:14:15,194
And where do your parents live?

104
00:14:15,597 --> 00:14:17,258
- In Cesena.
- By the sea?

105
00:14:17,466 --> 00:14:18,524
No.

106
00:14:20,336 --> 00:14:22,395
Well, how's it going?

107
00:14:22,805 --> 00:14:25,467
How's it going?
It's going.

108
00:14:27,111 --> 00:14:28,976
Things didn't go well tonight?

109
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,617
Some hypocrite gave me 1000 lira
and a pack of smokes.

110
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:35,908
Was he young or old?

111
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,817
Who knows?
I didn't look him in the face.

112
00:14:43,897 --> 00:14:46,127
Would you go with a woman
like this one?

113
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,664
No.

114
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:51,367
Why?
She's not worse than many others.

115
00:14:51,806 --> 00:14:53,899
You don't go with these
kind of women?

116
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:55,473
Yes, sometimes.

117
00:14:57,947 --> 00:15:01,906
Listen here, Gregory Peck,
I'm not getting any of this stuff.

118
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:03,676
What are we doing?

119
00:15:03,888 --> 00:15:06,982
- Didn't you say you wanted to go home?
- Yes.

120
00:15:07,191 --> 00:15:09,659
So we're taking you home.

121
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:16,027
- Why? What did you think?
- Me? Nothing. I wasn't thinking a thing.

122
00:15:25,113 --> 00:15:28,241
Let's be quiet. Everyone's
sleeping here. Turn off that radio.

123
00:15:28,451 --> 00:15:29,748
We're leaving anyway.

124
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,347
Who do you live with?
Is someone home?

125
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:35,720
- What's she saying?
- Lf someone is home.

126
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:39,090
No, my cousin's in Velletri
for a checkup and...

127
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,796
So will you offer us a cup of coffee?

128
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,495
Sure. I can make good coffee.

129
00:15:52,678 --> 00:15:55,579
I hope you're not expecting
to find a palace.

130
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:58,314
I'll show you the way.

131
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:29,382
The coffee.

132
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:37,154
Watch out for the stairs.
The other evening this kind man...

133
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:43,498
Oh, what a mess. It's flooded again.
This is no way to live. Damn it!

134
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,036
Wait there a moment.

135
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:50,339
The engineer!
He should have been a gravedigger!

136
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:56,350
That'll be the day.
I've been paying for all the devil's sins!

137
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,687
Come on!

138
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:06,731
Hold on, I'll have you go in the bedroom.
Good God.

139
00:17:07,803 --> 00:17:11,796
It's flooded here too. Have a seat
in the bedroom, I'll make you coffee.

140
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:14,771
I need to know someone important.
That's what I need.

141
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:18,645
I'm so sorry.
I put in a request two years ago, but...

142
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,907
Don't worry about it.

143
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:25,845
In the meantime,
I'll make some coffee, okay?

144
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:37,866
Would you close the door?

145
00:17:55,059 --> 00:17:56,822
You want to make love here?

146
00:17:58,397 --> 00:17:59,489
No?

147
00:18:27,197 --> 00:18:29,427
I'll leave your coffee here.

148
00:18:36,142 --> 00:18:39,270
You didn't agree on the terms before?
Are you crazy?

149
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:42,073
Hey, I don't know.
They did everything on their own!

150
00:18:42,282 --> 00:18:43,579
Was I supposed to kick them out?

151
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:48,449
- Hopefully they'll give me 2000 lira.
- 2000 lira? I set the price around here!

152
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:52,114
- Are they husband and wife?
- Yeah, right.

153
00:19:26,601 --> 00:19:28,034
Here. Many thanks.

154
00:19:28,236 --> 00:19:30,830
Must I back up,
or is there room to turn around?

155
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,804
No. It's easier if you turn right
at the end.

156
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:37,003
Can I give you a little kiss?
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

157
00:19:37,215 --> 00:19:39,877
- Come back when you want!
- Bye.

158
00:19:40,552 --> 00:19:42,452
Don't go speeding with that car, now!

159
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,916
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God!

160
00:20:41,724 --> 00:20:43,191
Emma.

161
00:20:44,894 --> 00:20:46,919
Emma! Emma!

162
00:20:47,465 --> 00:20:51,060
Emma, what's wrong?
Answer me, what happened?

163
00:20:59,313 --> 00:21:03,409
What did you do?
What did you do, you crazy fool?

164
00:21:18,169 --> 00:21:19,636
Emma!

165
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:25,634
It's nothing. Stay calm!
I'll take you to the hospital.

166
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:28,379
Why, I ask?
Why are you so crazy?

167
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:32,282
Do you...
Do you want to ruin me, huh?

168
00:21:32,486 --> 00:21:36,479
One of these days I'll just let you die.
I'll let you die!

169
00:21:39,594 --> 00:21:42,995
Emma, answer me.
Stop it now.

170
00:21:52,809 --> 00:21:55,505
Emma, honey...

171
00:21:56,247 --> 00:21:59,011
My love. Emma.

172
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:05,923
Hurry!

173
00:22:17,272 --> 00:22:20,469
Rubini! Did you bring that woman
who poisoned herself?

174
00:22:20,677 --> 00:22:23,441
Giannelli, do me a favor,
don't write anything.

175
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:25,910
I'll be in trouble with the police.

176
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,878
- What happened?
- Nothing.

177
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:31,851
- What is her name?
- I can't tell you. Leave me alone, please.

178
00:22:32,657 --> 00:22:34,181
You can come in.

179
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:36,326
Yes.

180
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:50,778
- Emma.
- Don't tire her. She needs to rest.

181
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:55,381
You can take her home
in a couple of hours.

182
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:58,782
In the meantime, see the brigadier
for the report. It's mandatory.

183
00:22:58,989 --> 00:23:00,854
Emma.

184
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:14,870
Emma, why did you do it?
Tell me. Why?

185
00:23:26,555 --> 00:23:28,352
The brigadier is waiting for you.

186
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,060
I'll be right back.

187
00:23:46,012 --> 00:23:48,572
Wait there, please,
he'll be right with you.

188
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:04,730
- Sister, can I use the phone?
- Sure, go ahead.

189
00:24:58,732 --> 00:25:02,532
- You come here. Come down!
- I just want to take one picture!

190
00:25:02,737 --> 00:25:03,704
Get your hands off me!

191
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:07,939
Sylvia! Sylvia!

192
00:25:16,187 --> 00:25:19,088
Your glasses! Your glasses!

193
00:25:25,164 --> 00:25:27,132
Take your glasses off!

194
00:25:27,934 --> 00:25:29,663
No! Go! Go back.

195
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,081
Sylvia, take your glasses off!

196
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:04,403
Come on, smile!

197
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,284
Do we give her the flowers first
or the pizza?

198
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,886
- The pizza!
- Be careful not to drop it!

199
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:16,921
Please bring your luggage
to customs,

200
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,390
Hurry up with this pizza,
you morons!

201
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,430
Stand back, stand back.

202
00:26:26,004 --> 00:26:27,562
He's here...

203
00:26:27,773 --> 00:26:30,469
The producer Toto Scalise
has just arrived.

204
00:26:30,676 --> 00:26:35,477
He's cast the star for a historic joint
production which will be shot in color...

205
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:37,046
Is that the Swedish woman?

206
00:26:37,249 --> 00:26:40,446
Oh, man, I better not see her
or I'll have to kill my wife tonight!

207
00:26:40,653 --> 00:26:42,211
Long live Sweden!

208
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:45,213
- Offered to the gorgeous
Swedish actress.

209
00:26:45,425 --> 00:26:47,086
Showing her wonderful teeth...

210
00:26:47,294 --> 00:26:50,695
...the beautiful Sylvia bites
into a typical Italian product...

211
00:26:50,899 --> 00:26:55,199
...which, with its colors and its aroma,
is as joyful as our country.

212
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:58,674
Hi, Marcello.
Great piece of meat, huh?

213
00:26:59,109 --> 00:27:04,240
Toto Scalise is leading the star through
customs. A crowd of fans awaits...

214
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:12,287
Such a long trip and she's
as fresh as a rose.

215
00:27:16,363 --> 00:27:18,923
Clementelli, go over to customs,
immediately.

216
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:34,547
- Did you have a good trip?
- Yes, thank you.

217
00:27:34,887 --> 00:27:36,548
What a confusion!

218
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:43,751
I

219
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:58,369
- Come on, Marcello, pass him!
- Quit it! There's nowhere to go!

220
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,775
Come on, pass him.
Run him over!

221
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,454
Is it true that every morning
you bathe in ice?

222
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,469
Do you ever practice yoga?

223
00:28:27,515 --> 00:28:31,246
Ask her which Italian historical figure
she would like to play.

224
00:28:31,454 --> 00:28:33,854
Do you like bearded men?

225
00:28:34,457 --> 00:28:38,154
Would you like something to drink?

226
00:28:39,096 --> 00:28:41,929
Ma'am, what do you think
about Italian actresses?

227
00:29:10,432 --> 00:29:14,095
For Cinema Nuovo, do you think
Italian neorealism is dead or alive?

228
00:29:15,238 --> 00:29:17,433
Do you believe in friendship
among peoples?

229
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,025
Come on, with this phone!

230
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:43,999
No, no. It's that I couldn't
call you before. Thanks.

231
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:50,642
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm working.

232
00:29:50,849 --> 00:29:52,441
Did you take your drops?

233
00:29:53,017 --> 00:29:54,507
Are you alone with her?

234
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:57,517
There are at least 50 people in here!

235
00:29:58,725 --> 00:30:01,558
Swear on your mother's life!
Go on, swear it!

236
00:30:01,761 --> 00:30:03,752
Yes, I swear on my mother.

237
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,835
Beautiful? Well, yes,
if you like American beauty.

238
00:30:10,037 --> 00:30:13,097
She's like a doll, like a big doll.

239
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,028
Yes.

240
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:44,704
Marcello, I'll come over there
and rip your eyes out!

241
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,447
Marcello, why don't you
come here right now?

242
00:30:48,652 --> 00:30:50,051
No, I can't.

243
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,815
- I want to make love.
- What?

244
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:54,454
I want to make love!

245
00:30:57,194 --> 00:30:59,662
- Yes, hold on a second.
- Where shall we take her?

246
00:30:59,864 --> 00:31:02,389
First to St. Peter's,
then to the Quirinale.

247
00:31:02,833 --> 00:31:03,857
Not a bad idea.

248
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:11,138
Here's our Robert!
Our actress' boyfriend.

249
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:24,553
- Marcello?
- What is it? Are you going out?

250
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,457
No, no. I'll wait for you here.
I'll stay home all day long.

251
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,894
What would you like to eat?
Something light.

252
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:35,368
You want a nice plate of ravioli?

253
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:39,503
I've got everything.
I'll just go downstairs for vegetables.

254
00:31:40,146 --> 00:31:43,115
Then we'll go to the movies,
or we can stay in. As you like.

255
00:31:43,683 --> 00:31:46,083
Marcello, do you love me?

256
00:32:07,845 --> 00:32:09,870
Don't leave her alone!

257
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:44,212
Wonderful! Let's do another one.
Stop!

258
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:50,728
She never stops for a minute!

259
00:33:05,981 --> 00:33:09,178
I finished the film.
I'll be right back, okay?

260
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:20,693
- Hey, where did she go?
- She's an elevator, that one!

261
00:35:10,697 --> 00:35:14,793
You're everything, Sylvia.
You know that you're everything?

262
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,435
You're the first woman of creation.

263
00:35:23,346 --> 00:35:26,543
You're the mother, the sister,
the lover, the friend...

264
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,377
...the angel, the devil,
the Earth, the home.

265
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,919
That's what you are: The home!

266
00:35:35,561 --> 00:35:37,085
Sylvia...

267
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:41,866
Why did you come here?

268
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:47,504
Go back to America, please.
What am I supposed to do now?

269
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,553
Oh, our Robert is also a painter.
Bravo!

270
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,566
I must see you.
I must talk to you at all costs.

271
00:36:30,926 --> 00:36:34,760
- Who's that madman?
- Frankie Stout, a divine actor!

272
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:32,159
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Go, sweetheart, go!

273
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,902
He's dancing with the lady!

274
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,743
Hi, darling.

275
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:24,263
- He's a good dancer.
- Sweet as sugar.

276
00:39:24,501 --> 00:39:26,196
Very... Very good, yes.

277
00:39:27,238 --> 00:39:29,763
- You're having banana flambe, huh?
- What else?

278
00:39:30,108 --> 00:39:32,975
- The lady's shoes.
- I'll take them, I'll take them.

279
00:39:33,178 --> 00:39:35,976
- I found them...
- That's fine, thank you.

280
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:39,545
Excuse me. One moment.

281
00:40:04,381 --> 00:40:05,507
What do you want?

282
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:30,385
Bravo! Bravo, Frankie!
You were great!

283
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,527
Bravo! Very good!
Look, you made me cry. Bravo!

284
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:42,102
What class, madam.
You're divine!

285
00:42:42,304 --> 00:42:45,000
Dangerous stuff, but very beautiful.

286
00:42:45,207 --> 00:42:46,970
Thank you, sir!

287
00:42:50,448 --> 00:42:52,973
Marcello, give me the champagne!

288
00:43:44,878 --> 00:43:48,575
I don't know.
I'll bring her back immediately.

289
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:51,548
Give me the shoes. Let go.
I'll be right back.

290
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:55,120
- Why did she get upset?
- Stay here. I'll take care of it.

291
00:43:55,825 --> 00:43:57,053
Here she is!

292
00:43:58,362 --> 00:44:00,592
- Sylvia, the shoes!
- Marcello, what happened?

293
00:44:00,799 --> 00:44:02,699
Nothing happened.
Go away!

294
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:04,266
Let's take your scooter.

295
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:05,869
Marcello, wait for us!

296
00:44:07,973 --> 00:44:09,770
Great idea, Marcello!

297
00:44:10,977 --> 00:44:12,569
Let's take her to Ostia.

298
00:44:17,986 --> 00:44:20,580
Paparazzo, I'm not kidding,
get out of the car!

299
00:44:20,789 --> 00:44:23,815
It'll be an incredible scoop.
I'll give you 50 percent.

300
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:26,620
I don't give a damn about 50 percent.
Go away!

301
00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:28,353
I'll give you 30 percent.

302
00:44:31,334 --> 00:44:34,792
- Get lost!
- Marcello, tell me where you're going!

303
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,843
He didn't tell me where he's going.
Hurry!

304
00:44:59,168 --> 00:45:00,795
We lost them.

305
00:45:08,813 --> 00:45:10,781
Yes... No... Of course!

306
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:21,497
What?

307
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:51,295
...it's full of holes there.

308
00:47:09,558 --> 00:47:11,389
We'd better leave now.

309
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:15,555
Maybe some other time.

310
00:47:20,536 --> 00:47:24,495
Sergio will be back on the 12th.
I'm his mother.

311
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:28,906
- Do you have the key?
- No, he takes the studio key with him.

312
00:47:29,113 --> 00:47:31,547
I'm his mother. Was this for work?

313
00:47:31,916 --> 00:47:34,783
Yes, madam, it was about a job.

314
00:47:34,987 --> 00:47:36,454
But I'll call...

315
00:47:36,655 --> 00:47:39,351
I'll call back on the 12th.
It doesn't matter.

316
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,994
Sorry to disturb, madam.
Good night.

317
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,664
Excuse me, isn't she
that American actress?

318
00:47:48,871 --> 00:47:50,600
- Yes.
- She's so beautiful!

319
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:52,103
Good night.

320
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:08,125
I can't bring you home.
That madwoman wouldn't understand.

321
00:48:08,328 --> 00:48:10,353
Understand?

322
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:14,190
Wait a minute.
I've got an idea that maybe...

323
00:48:16,905 --> 00:48:21,968
- Miss, a phone call for you.
- Yes?

324
00:48:22,978 --> 00:48:26,778
Marcello! Are you sure
you didn't dial the wrong number?

325
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,012
Listen, Maddalena,
can I come with someone?

326
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:33,585
- Someone? Who?
- Who calls her at this hour?

327
00:48:34,325 --> 00:48:36,816
Someone... Someone.

328
00:48:37,629 --> 00:48:42,293
- Why, you're not alone?
- I'm playing cards with my father.

329
00:48:44,436 --> 00:48:46,131
Oh, your father's there.

330
00:48:46,606 --> 00:48:48,130
Tell me.

331
00:48:49,442 --> 00:48:51,171
What is it that you want?

332
00:48:51,713 --> 00:48:55,171
Nothing. I'll call you soon.
I apologize. Good night.

333
00:49:10,235 --> 00:49:12,965
Sylvia, what are you doing?

334
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,885
No, dear. Where am I going
to find milk at this hour?

335
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:31,850
Sylvia!
Where are you going with that cat?

336
00:49:32,061 --> 00:49:34,154
Rome is full of cats, if we start...

337
00:49:34,496 --> 00:49:35,793
Come here! Stop!

338
00:49:38,668 --> 00:49:42,195
You don't know. Wait in the car.
I'll go get it.

339
00:49:44,274 --> 00:49:47,801
I'm going. Get in the car.

340
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:00,582
Excuse me. Do you know where
I can I buy some milk? Some...

341
00:50:00,795 --> 00:50:02,558
All right, all right. Thanks.

342
00:51:38,546 --> 00:51:41,538
Yes, Sylvia, I'm coming too.

343
00:51:42,584 --> 00:51:44,108
I'm coming too.

344
00:51:48,725 --> 00:51:52,161
Yes, I guess she's right.
I'm making a mistake.

345
00:51:52,363 --> 00:51:54,558
We're all making a mistake!

346
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,910
Sylvia, who are you?

347
00:52:47,829 --> 00:52:48,853
Turn him.

348
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:53,968
Stay right there. Good.
Don't you move.

349
00:52:54,169 --> 00:52:58,572
- And to think this guy did Tarzan,
- Put him back.

350
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,072
I'll take this one from the mirror.

351
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:10,984
Stay there. I'll take one while
you're photographing him.

352
00:53:12,925 --> 00:53:14,916
Here they are. Here's Marcello.

353
00:53:17,397 --> 00:53:19,991
- Mr. Robert.
- Not again, guys. Go away.

354
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,428
Hey, wake up!

355
00:53:21,801 --> 00:53:25,897
Mr. Robert. Sylvia! Look!

356
00:53:30,546 --> 00:53:33,071
Marcello, you've got to
give us the details.

357
00:53:33,884 --> 00:53:37,376
- Do me a favor. Leave!
- But I've got to work!

358
00:53:37,588 --> 00:53:39,886
- Enough.
- Get lost, will you?

359
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:42,355
- Enough, please!
- Why is her dress wet?

360
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:44,825
- Why is it wet, Marcello?
- I don't know!

361
00:53:51,138 --> 00:53:53,402
This will end up in a fight.

362
00:54:20,139 --> 00:54:21,629
Go after her, Mr. Robert.

363
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:26,039
- How do you say "Go after her"?
- Hurry, it's not over yet.

364
00:54:33,288 --> 00:54:36,018
Marcello, can you fight in English?

365
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:47,299
- Nice!
- Marcello, hit him too, no?

366
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:51,464
- Marcello, raise your head a bit.
- Is he leaving already? Mr. Robert.

367
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:53,041
Marcello, what happened?

368
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:02,615
Marcello! This one is done.
Now what do I do?

369
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:06,682
Put the horse on the table
and her on the ground.

370
00:55:14,237 --> 00:55:15,431
I'll be right back.

371
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:18,574
Do I pick you up at 8 tonight?
Yes or no?

372
00:55:18,776 --> 00:55:23,270
- Boy, you sure are vain.
- I'm not vain, dear. I work.

373
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:37,857
Steiner.

374
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:41,064
I thought I saw you come in.

375
00:55:41,269 --> 00:55:43,567
How are you?
What are you doing here?

376
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:46,900
And you?
I'm so happy to see you again.

377
00:55:49,011 --> 00:55:51,275
Well, I'm kind of at home here.

378
00:55:52,048 --> 00:55:55,745
Father Franz found this book for me.

379
00:55:55,954 --> 00:55:59,412
It's an old Sanskrit grammar book.

380
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:06,058
It's been so long!
How's your book going?

381
00:56:06,265 --> 00:56:09,723
It's going. I'm gathering material.
Actually, I just finished.

382
00:56:09,937 --> 00:56:13,532
I thought I'd let you read it.
And you?

383
00:56:13,741 --> 00:56:17,643
I read one of your recent articles.
I liked it very much.

384
00:56:17,846 --> 00:56:22,340
- No.
- Why? It was fine.

385
00:56:23,587 --> 00:56:26,317
It was vivid, passionate...

386
00:56:27,023 --> 00:56:28,547
...the best of you.

387
00:56:28,758 --> 00:56:32,717
Qualities you insist on hiding
which nonetheless belong to you.

388
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,298
- I don't think I know how to write.
- I live around here.

389
00:56:36,503 --> 00:56:39,597
Why don't you come
to see me one evening?

390
00:56:40,341 --> 00:56:43,902
- Can you stay another five minutes?
- Sure.

391
00:56:46,214 --> 00:56:49,081
- Father, can I come up with a friend?
- Yes. Sure.

392
00:56:49,284 --> 00:56:52,117
- Are you sure we're not disturbing?
- Not at all. Come on.

393
00:56:52,388 --> 00:56:55,915
As you see, these priests
don't fear the devil.

394
00:56:56,125 --> 00:56:57,490
On the contrary.

395
00:56:58,362 --> 00:57:01,092
They even let me play the organ.

396
00:57:02,099 --> 00:57:04,499
Okay, Steiner, don't be too noisy.

397
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:07,796
Don't worry.
You'll hear some jazz at the most.

398
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,841
- Couldn't we close the church?
- Lf it's jazz, I like it.

399
00:57:13,978 --> 00:57:17,141
Sorry, I promise I won't do it again.

400
00:57:18,117 --> 00:57:19,709
You want to try, Marcello?

401
00:57:27,696 --> 00:57:29,926
We're not used to hearing
these sounds anymore.

402
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:34,298
Such a mysterious voice.
It seems to come from inside the Earth.

403
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:38,705
- What would you like to hear?
- You choose. I trust you.

404
00:58:55,768 --> 00:58:59,169
Where did they say it was?
At the end of a wall?

405
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:03,570
- Hey, Paparazzo!
- They told me at the 47th kilometer.

406
00:59:06,948 --> 00:59:09,508
- I don't want an egg at this hour!
- Eat it.

407
00:59:09,719 --> 00:59:11,584
- I don't want it!
- Eat it.

408
00:59:14,091 --> 00:59:16,082
- And chew slowly.
- Yes.

409
00:59:16,293 --> 00:59:21,026
We should've come yesterday.
It'll be packed with photographers.

410
00:59:21,733 --> 00:59:26,193
- Do you have some coffee?
- Not much, and Marcello needs it.

411
00:59:27,706 --> 00:59:29,674
I don't want a banana.

412
00:59:30,177 --> 00:59:33,271
- I don't want it, Emma!
- Eat it. Eat it.

413
00:59:36,517 --> 00:59:38,348
- And chew slowly.
- Yes.

414
00:59:47,364 --> 00:59:50,390
- The Madonna's children?
- Yes!

415
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:55,560
- Where is the miracle field?
- That way!

416
01:00:14,697 --> 01:00:17,564
It's better if you stay here.
There's too much confusion.

417
01:00:21,739 --> 01:00:24,503
Norman! Norman!

418
01:00:24,709 --> 01:00:27,177
Here. Don't go anywhere.
Norman!

419
01:00:31,315 --> 01:00:33,545
Hi, Norman.
Where are the children?

420
01:00:33,751 --> 01:00:36,743
They're locked up
in police headquarters.

421
01:00:36,954 --> 01:00:40,185
Take me with you. I'll tell you
all about the Communists.

422
01:00:40,392 --> 01:00:42,656
- Is that the miracle tree?
- It's down there.

423
01:00:46,534 --> 01:00:50,868
Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!

424
01:01:01,319 --> 01:01:05,517
You can't keep those two children
in there. It's an abuse!

425
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:09,017
- They say everyone's upstairs.
- Let's go in. Come on.

426
01:01:19,241 --> 01:01:20,799
- Where?
- This way!

427
01:01:22,344 --> 01:01:24,835
- Where are the children?
- I don't know.

428
01:01:25,047 --> 01:01:27,174
- And where is the marshal?
- Who knows?

429
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:37,154
What about the 500 lira that
that journalist gave you?

430
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,454
Can I go home?

431
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:43,497
- Brigadier, sir...
- The lady gave you 1000 lira...

432
01:01:43,702 --> 01:01:46,671
I feel a bad pain in my waist.
I'm catching a cold.

433
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:48,932
You're right.
It feels like winter already.

434
01:01:49,141 --> 01:01:51,974
If you're going to give me some
money, don't tell my husband.

435
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:55,239
- I won't give you any. Look over there.
- Where? That way?

436
01:02:01,390 --> 01:02:05,486
- Now over here. Like this.
- The grandfather's here too!

437
01:02:05,695 --> 01:02:08,596
What are the children's names?

438
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:09,766
- Dario.
- What?

439
01:02:09,967 --> 01:02:12,595
- Dario and Maria.
- Dario and Maria. Nice!

440
01:02:12,871 --> 01:02:14,168
Good! Yes, cry!

441
01:02:14,406 --> 01:02:18,240
It's a real miracle.
The Madonna remembers everyone!

442
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,344
- Do I look good like this?
- You're perfect!

443
01:02:23,016 --> 01:02:26,076
- The cigar?
- I'll give it to you. Sing first.

444
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:33,025
- Then it's not a miracle?
- I don't believe it.

445
01:02:33,229 --> 01:02:37,632
The Lord can do it anywhere, they
often occur for the less fortunate...

446
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,598
...but they are very rare events.
- Couldn't this be one?

447
01:02:40,804 --> 01:02:43,068
No, those youngsters
aren't being honest.

448
01:02:43,274 --> 01:02:48,337
Whoever sees the Madonna is changed.
They don't make money on her!

449
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:54,816
Miracles are born out of silence,
not in this confusion!

450
01:02:55,255 --> 01:02:57,348
So, kids, while you
were going to school,,,

451
01:02:57,557 --> 01:02:59,354
,,, who did you see next to that tree?

452
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,358
- The Madonna,
- And who saw her first?

453
01:03:02,563 --> 01:03:03,530
- I did!
- I did!

454
01:03:03,731 --> 01:03:07,360
- You saw her together, then?
- No, he saw her first!

455
01:03:07,568 --> 01:03:10,128
- Then what happened?
- They're my niece and nephew.

456
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:14,003
We got on our knees,
The Madonna looked at us and smiled,

457
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:16,178
Her feet didn 't touch the ground,

458
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:19,075
Did she tell you
she was the Madonna?

459
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:22,241
They really don't want to believe it.

460
01:03:22,855 --> 01:03:25,050
Could it really have been
the Madonna?

461
01:03:25,257 --> 01:03:27,487
It doesn't matter if it is or not.

462
01:03:28,228 --> 01:03:31,925
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
Why do you say that?

463
01:03:32,132 --> 01:03:33,622
Of course it doesn't matter.

464
01:03:33,835 --> 01:03:38,966
Your Italy is an ancient land filled
with natural and supernatural forces.

465
01:03:39,442 --> 01:03:43,344
Therefore,
everyone feels their influence.

466
01:03:43,546 --> 01:03:45,537
He who looks for God
finds him where he wants.

467
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:50,084
- Did you come for a miracle too?
- No, I'm here with my boyfriend.

468
01:03:50,621 --> 01:03:53,613
He's a journalist. He's here for work.

469
01:03:54,726 --> 01:03:59,254
All this yelling, these people,
frighten me.

470
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:03,958
You three stay in that spot.
And don't laugh! Bring up the crane.

471
01:04:04,504 --> 01:04:07,268
Higher. Keep going.

472
01:04:07,641 --> 01:04:11,407
Sorry, I made a mistake!
Come down! Come back down.

473
01:04:11,612 --> 01:04:13,978
Let's try the children's scene!

474
01:04:14,182 --> 01:04:19,245
Remember, the children are smaller.
Am I in the shot? Can you see me?

475
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,489
Come on! Quickly!

476
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:24,354
Quickly! Hurry, please.

477
01:04:25,296 --> 01:04:28,595
- Here's my boyfriend.
- Good. Go to him.

478
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:30,927
Excuse me for a moment.

479
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:33,267
Ready? Go!

480
01:04:34,073 --> 01:04:38,976
Speak up! Why aren't you praying?
Everyone has to yell!

481
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:41,879
Pray more! Pray more!

482
01:04:43,251 --> 01:04:46,880
Now, it's 7:00.
We'll meet in a couple of hours.

483
01:04:47,155 --> 01:04:51,353
Grab a bite to eat. Thank you. See you
this evening. Have a good meal!

484
01:04:51,561 --> 01:04:57,898
Alessi Emilio, Alessi Stefania.
Bertolucci Eugenio.

485
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:03,167
Bertone Mario, Bertone Letizia,,,,

486
01:05:03,374 --> 01:05:08,004
Holy Madonna,
make this child of mine get well.

487
01:05:08,214 --> 01:05:12,014
Grant me this wish.
I ask you with all my soul.

488
01:05:19,026 --> 01:05:20,721
Marcello...

489
01:05:24,466 --> 01:05:30,200
Don't worry, honey.
The Madonna hears us. She's good.

490
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:08,913
A large crowd has gathered in this
once deserted and unknown area.

491
01:06:09,353 --> 01:06:11,981
Many are believers, many are curious.

492
01:06:12,191 --> 01:06:16,525
Among the curious there are journalists,
photo reporters and correspondents...

493
01:06:16,729 --> 01:06:18,890
...from papers all over the world.

494
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:22,402
There is an innumerable number
of cars piled up.

495
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:24,697
The night is humid but full of stars.

496
01:06:24,906 --> 01:06:27,340
The weather has improved
after all the rain.

497
01:06:27,542 --> 01:06:30,841
We just found out that the two children
are still held by the police.

498
01:06:31,046 --> 01:06:34,015
We await further word from Rome.

499
01:06:34,217 --> 01:06:37,380
We're now interviewing
the two children's uncle.

500
01:06:37,587 --> 01:06:42,047
We want to ask him, when was
the first time they saw the...

501
01:06:42,526 --> 01:06:44,517
The miracle.

502
01:06:44,728 --> 01:06:50,860
My niece and nephew first saw the holy
image of the Madonna on March 15 of...

503
01:06:52,372 --> 01:06:53,430
...the next year.

504
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,006
- You mean the current year.
- The current year. And...

505
01:06:56,744 --> 01:06:58,075
The children are coming.

506
01:06:58,279 --> 01:07:00,179
- Permission from Rome has arrived.
- Really?

507
01:07:00,381 --> 01:07:03,179
- Yes, they are coming.
- The children are coming!

508
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:09,248
Emma, you stay here. Good evening.
I'll be right back.

509
01:07:09,492 --> 01:07:11,756
- Where are you going?
- I'm going up there to see something.

510
01:07:11,961 --> 01:07:15,624
- I'm coming too.
- No, honey, stay here with the lady.

511
01:07:15,834 --> 01:07:17,199
Come on.

512
01:07:20,672 --> 01:07:22,037
Wait here.

513
01:07:37,259 --> 01:07:39,193
Marcello, come down.

514
01:07:39,395 --> 01:07:41,829
But I just came up. Don't worry.

515
01:07:46,336 --> 01:07:47,462
Should I come up?

516
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:56,008
Amilcare, tell the generator operator
to move down a bit more,

517
01:07:56,214 --> 01:07:59,843
Try the channel hoses and keep them
at minimum capacity,

518
01:08:00,254 --> 01:08:03,849
Try the channel hoses and keep them
at minimum capacity,

519
01:08:07,362 --> 01:08:10,729
Marcello, why did you change so much?

520
01:08:11,999 --> 01:08:14,160
Why don't you love me anymore?

521
01:08:18,941 --> 01:08:22,001
Holy Madonna, if only he married me...

522
01:08:22,212 --> 01:08:26,148
...I'd come here on foot every day
and thank you.

523
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,477
But I'm not asking you that.

524
01:08:28,954 --> 01:08:32,151
I'd just like him to be mine
as he was once.

525
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:35,260
- Here they are!
- The children!

526
01:08:35,996 --> 01:08:37,725
Here they are!
Go as high as you can.

527
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:41,129
As soon as they get to the tree,
get a nice dolly shot.

528
01:09:16,576 --> 01:09:19,704
Wait, don't start yet.
I'll give you the signal!

529
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:21,605
Hi, beautiful, how are you?

530
01:09:21,816 --> 01:09:26,549
Put the 5000 on them and then
on the crowd. It's dark over here.

531
01:09:36,368 --> 01:09:38,666
My wife is there too.

532
01:09:40,106 --> 01:09:43,166
Sometimes she makes me so upset
and other times...

533
01:09:48,016 --> 01:09:50,246
Heal me!

534
01:09:59,196 --> 01:10:01,426
Calm down, keep calm.

535
01:10:02,767 --> 01:10:04,667
One at a time.

536
01:10:11,310 --> 01:10:14,074
- It's raining.
- This is going to get dangerous.

537
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:26,385
Massimo, the water makes
the lights explode. Shut everything off!

538
01:10:27,028 --> 01:10:29,553
Turn all generators off!

539
01:10:29,764 --> 01:10:32,528
Turn all generators off!

540
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:50,344
We had to take shelter in the bus
because it started to rain again.

541
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:54,483
Mario! Mario!

542
01:10:54,695 --> 01:10:57,163
Mario, where are you?

543
01:11:06,876 --> 01:11:08,969
The Madonna is over there.

544
01:11:24,932 --> 01:11:27,833
The children are getting up again.

545
01:11:28,035 --> 01:11:30,560
Now they're running
in the opposite direction.

546
01:11:30,771 --> 01:11:32,830
They cry out that they see
the Madonna.

547
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:35,734
The crowd is following them,
going wild.

548
01:11:50,695 --> 01:11:54,597
They changed direction once again,
they're headed to another area.

549
01:12:12,556 --> 01:12:14,080
There she is!

550
01:12:27,740 --> 01:12:30,504
Let me through,
this is going to kill them.

551
01:12:30,710 --> 01:12:32,575
They'll catch pneumonia!

552
01:12:36,583 --> 01:12:38,574
The Madonna said that
if you don't build a church here...

553
01:12:38,785 --> 01:12:41,117
...she won't come anymore.
- Quiet!

554
01:12:41,322 --> 01:12:43,813
The Madonna said
that if you don't build a church here...

555
01:12:44,025 --> 01:12:48,724
...she won't come anymore.
Good night. Go home! Get some sleep!

556
01:14:00,550 --> 01:14:03,144
Let me go! Let me go!

557
01:14:03,388 --> 01:14:06,915
- Paparazzo, give me a break.
- But it's a nice shot!

558
01:14:07,125 --> 01:14:11,323
Let me go! How can you be this way?
It's not possible to be like you!

559
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:16,695
Hyenas! You're worse than hyenas!
You don't respect anyone!

560
01:14:16,904 --> 01:14:20,738
You make me sick! Cowards!

561
01:14:30,219 --> 01:14:33,620
Why are you crying now?!
Where did you leave her?

562
01:14:33,825 --> 01:14:36,157
I don't remember!
I don't remember!

563
01:14:44,302 --> 01:14:45,963
He's dead.

564
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:52,844
He's dead!

565
01:14:53,414 --> 01:14:55,678
He's dead.

566
01:14:55,883 --> 01:15:00,547
Out of the depths I cry to thee, O Lord.
Lord, hear my voice.

567
01:15:00,755 --> 01:15:04,191
Let thy ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.

568
01:15:04,393 --> 01:15:06,884
If thou, O Lord,
shouldst mark iniquities...

569
01:15:11,601 --> 01:15:15,401
...to thou, O Lord, we present
the humble soul of thy son, Aloisio...

570
01:15:15,607 --> 01:15:17,973
...who will live with thou
forever and ever.

571
01:15:22,281 --> 01:15:27,218
Grant him eternal rest, O Lord,
and may perpetual light shine on him.

572
01:15:35,397 --> 01:15:35,531
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

573
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,991
Good evening, I'm Steiner's wife.
We were waiting for you.

574
01:15:55,354 --> 01:15:57,481
Good evening, Marcello.
How are you?

575
01:15:57,689 --> 01:16:00,214
Good. What a lovely home.

576
01:16:00,427 --> 01:16:04,090
Is this Emma?
I've been wanting to meet you.

577
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,760
- Thanks for coming.
- Pardon me.

578
01:16:07,969 --> 01:16:09,197
Come here.

579
01:16:09,838 --> 01:16:12,500
- Hi, Anna, how are you?
- Did you finish your book?

580
01:16:12,909 --> 01:16:15,070
This is Margherita.
You know her paintings.

581
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:16,506
- Of course.
- Sure!

582
01:16:16,713 --> 01:16:19,409
- You didn't even come to my exhibition.
- What a beautiful hand.

583
01:16:19,616 --> 01:16:21,208
She's a big fan of yours...

584
01:16:21,486 --> 01:16:24,785
...but it's not true, because she
doesn't speak a word of Italian.

585
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,355
She only said that
you're very decorative.

586
01:16:27,561 --> 01:16:28,994
She's right.

587
01:16:31,097 --> 01:16:34,089
It might sound strange,
but I think I know you well.

588
01:16:34,535 --> 01:16:38,869
The day you understand that you love
Marcello more than he does...

589
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,600
...you'll be happy.

590
01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:51,380
I always said it. The only real woman
is the Oriental one.

591
01:16:51,589 --> 01:16:55,457
After all, where was Eve?
In the Garden of Eden.

592
01:16:55,693 --> 01:16:58,526
And where was the Garden of Eden?
In the Orient!

593
01:16:58,730 --> 01:17:02,325
- Over there, love is really...
- Why did you marry me, then?

594
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,799
I know, I made a big mistake.

595
01:17:05,104 --> 01:17:09,165
Mysterious, motherly,
both lover and daughter.

596
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:14,336
The Oriental woman huddles
at your feet like a little tiger in love.

597
01:17:14,617 --> 01:17:17,484
This guy's been talking
about the Orient for 15 years.

598
01:17:17,687 --> 01:17:19,052
Why doesn't he stay there?

599
01:17:19,456 --> 01:17:21,890
- Will you introduce Emma to me?
- Of course.

600
01:17:22,092 --> 01:17:24,822
What a lovely face!
Can I say something?

601
01:17:25,029 --> 01:17:26,690
Don't lose hold of this man.

602
01:17:26,897 --> 01:17:31,129
I'm saying this in his best interest,
not yours, otherwise...

603
01:17:31,335 --> 01:17:34,566
The Oriental submits both
her spirit and her flesh...

604
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:36,138
...entirely!

605
01:17:36,341 --> 01:17:40,869
May I introduce my friend Marcello
and his girlfriend Emma?

606
01:17:41,081 --> 01:17:42,241
Good evening, everyone.

607
01:17:42,449 --> 01:17:44,508
I agree with your concept on women.

608
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,583
We have much to learn
from these Oriental women.

609
01:17:47,789 --> 01:17:50,417
Because they've remained
close to nature...

610
01:17:50,659 --> 01:17:54,254
...the nature they conquered
after many centuries of civilization.

611
01:17:54,464 --> 01:17:57,524
- What use is civilization to you?
- Say what?

612
01:17:57,735 --> 01:18:01,398
I'll tell you. You don't know
how to make love anymore!

613
01:18:01,605 --> 01:18:03,698
Speak for yourself, Leonida.

614
01:18:04,275 --> 01:18:05,742
- Would you like a drink?
- Yes, thanks.

615
01:18:05,943 --> 01:18:07,774
I envy you very much.

616
01:18:07,979 --> 01:18:11,107
You know, I've read all your stories
from around the world.

617
01:18:11,317 --> 01:18:14,411
I'd like to travel myself.
You get the chance...

618
01:18:14,655 --> 01:18:17,146
...to meet exceptional people,
women of all races.

619
01:18:17,358 --> 01:18:19,883
I'd like to have children of all colors:
Red, yellow...

620
01:18:20,094 --> 01:18:23,154
Imagine the satisfaction.
Like a bouquet of country flowers.

621
01:18:23,397 --> 01:18:25,024
Can't you say anything else?

622
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,531
You must have an incredible
gallery of memories.

623
01:18:27,737 --> 01:18:28,538
Memories? You think someone my age
can be happy with memories?

624
01:18:28,538 --> 01:18:30,972
Memories? You think someone my age
can be happy with memories?

625
01:18:31,175 --> 01:18:32,972
Most of all, I have projects.

626
01:18:33,177 --> 01:18:36,374
What a splendid creature.
You're our friend's girlfriend?

627
01:18:36,647 --> 01:18:38,945
- Yes.
- You must be from the South.

628
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:41,050
What an extraordinary guy.

629
01:18:41,252 --> 01:18:47,122
He's written dozens of important books
and has maintained a childish candor.

630
01:18:47,326 --> 01:18:50,625
I wonder where he finds so much
optimism, so much faith.

631
01:18:51,565 --> 01:18:54,864
I'm happy that he comes and
I always watch him with awe.

632
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,470
At times, I wonder if I envy him.

633
01:18:57,973 --> 01:19:01,465
Listen, I see that you have
a wonderful Morandi.

634
01:19:01,678 --> 01:19:04,670
Oh, yes, he's my favorite painter.

635
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:07,475
The objects are flooded
with a wistful light...

636
01:19:07,685 --> 01:19:11,621
...and yet painted with such
a detachment, precision, rigor...

637
01:19:12,656 --> 01:19:15,853
...that makes them almost tangible.
You can say that it's an art...

638
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:18,221
...where nothing is coincidental.

639
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:20,796
Steiner said that you have two loves...

640
01:19:21,667 --> 01:19:24,295
...and you don't know
which one to choose.

641
01:19:24,505 --> 01:19:29,204
Journalism and literature.
Watch out for prisons.

642
01:19:29,410 --> 01:19:32,868
Stay free, available, like me.

643
01:19:33,081 --> 01:19:36,448
Never get married. Never choose.

644
01:19:36,987 --> 01:19:39,547
Even in love, it's better to be chosen.

645
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:47,226
I read your poetry a few years ago,
when I thought about writing poetry.

646
01:19:47,432 --> 01:19:49,627
I like it. It's strong, sharp.

647
01:19:49,835 --> 01:19:54,329
- It doesn't seem like a woman's writing.
- What do you know about women?

648
01:19:54,541 --> 01:19:58,477
This is the art I prefer.
The one I think we'll need tomorrow.

649
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:00,738
A clear, precise art...

650
01:20:00,948 --> 01:20:05,112
...without rhetoric, that doesn't lie,
that isn't flattering.

651
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:09,984
Now I have a job that I don't like,
but I often think about tomorrow.

652
01:20:10,193 --> 01:20:14,653
We must all think about tomorrow,
but without forgetting to live today.

653
01:20:15,064 --> 01:20:18,431
I think if one lives intensely...

654
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:23,004
...in fullness of spirit,
every instant will count as a year...

655
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:27,201
...and every year one
will be five years younger!

656
01:20:30,450 --> 01:20:36,480
- Iris, you're an oracle tonight.
- An alcoholic oracle!

657
01:20:37,693 --> 01:20:40,662
Oh, friends, you think too much
about the future.

658
01:20:40,863 --> 01:20:45,266
But you seem so different.
What do you do with your days?

659
01:20:45,468 --> 01:20:49,234
I mean, what do you like to do most?

660
01:20:50,308 --> 01:20:52,799
Well, I don't know. And you?

661
01:20:53,011 --> 01:20:56,572
I know it exactly.
I like the three big escapes:

662
01:20:56,781 --> 01:21:01,684
- Drinking, smoking and going to bed.
- And this is your wisdom.

663
01:21:01,888 --> 01:21:04,914
You read my poems,
but you never understood me.

664
01:21:05,158 --> 01:21:10,391
You are the true primitive,
as primitive as a Gothic spire.

665
01:21:10,598 --> 01:21:15,900
You're so tall that you can't hear
any more voices up there.

666
01:21:16,105 --> 01:21:20,371
If you could see my real height,
you'll see I'm not much taller than this:

667
01:21:30,488 --> 01:21:32,547
- As primitive as a Gothic spire,

668
01:21:32,759 --> 01:21:38,664
You're so tall that you can 't hear
any more voices up there,

669
01:21:38,866 --> 01:21:43,599
If you could see my real height,
you'll see I'm not much taller than this:

670
01:21:48,243 --> 01:21:51,906
Oh, this is an old recording.
I'm sorry, I'll shut it off.

671
01:21:52,114 --> 01:21:55,345
What is it? Why can't we hear it?

672
01:21:55,552 --> 01:21:58,385
I don't want to bore you.
They're just sounds.

673
01:21:58,655 --> 01:22:01,385
They're nature sounds he's recorded.

674
01:22:01,593 --> 01:22:03,959
- Tell him to play them, please.
- No, it's not worth it.

675
01:22:04,163 --> 01:22:05,289
Come on.

676
01:22:05,497 --> 01:22:07,988
If they don't interest you,
why did you record them?

677
01:22:08,201 --> 01:22:12,228
Because I thought they were beautiful.
Do you really want to hear them?

678
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,273
I already know them,
they're extremely stimulating.

679
01:22:15,476 --> 01:22:16,773
As you wish.

680
01:22:43,008 --> 01:22:44,669
Birds.

681
01:22:47,547 --> 01:22:49,481
That's exactly how they sound.

682
01:22:56,759 --> 01:22:57,987
This is a forest.

683
01:23:09,141 --> 01:23:11,336
What are you guys doing here?

684
01:23:12,244 --> 01:23:15,543
- Why did you get out of bed?
- Excuse me a moment.

685
01:23:15,749 --> 01:23:18,912
You'll get a cold with those bare feet!

686
01:23:19,153 --> 01:23:21,678
He heard your storm and he woke up.

687
01:23:25,193 --> 01:23:28,993
- You just wanted one more kiss!
- Daddy hardhead.

688
01:23:29,196 --> 01:23:33,292
Daddy hardhead?
All right, everyone knows now!

689
01:23:33,501 --> 01:23:36,993
- Daddy's hardheaded.
- What lovely children!

690
01:23:38,340 --> 01:23:42,037
- Such intelligent eyes he has.
- Yes, it's true.

691
01:23:42,245 --> 01:23:44,338
When one says something
that strikes him...

692
01:23:44,549 --> 01:23:49,953
...first he thinks about it with a serious
little face and then he laughs cheerfully.

693
01:23:51,323 --> 01:23:55,020
If you give him a flower,
first he looks at every part...

694
01:23:55,228 --> 01:23:58,288
...then he laughs because
he understands that it's beautiful.

695
01:23:58,499 --> 01:24:01,525
The same way you smile when
you listen to some good music.

696
01:24:02,671 --> 01:24:05,367
Well, now, be good
and go back to sleep.

697
01:24:05,575 --> 01:24:08,169
Then, I promise,
I'll come say good night.

698
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:10,845
- Now, say good night to everyone.
- Good night.

699
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:17,776
The girl is completely different.
She loves combinations of words.

700
01:24:17,989 --> 01:24:19,923
A new phrase enchants her.

701
01:24:20,692 --> 01:24:24,321
At times she invents beautiful ones
herself. I noted some of them.

702
01:24:24,630 --> 01:24:29,329
For example:
"Who is the mother of the sun?"

703
01:24:30,905 --> 01:24:34,932
It's really beautiful.
It's like a poet's phrase.

704
01:24:35,676 --> 01:24:40,443
- And do they sleep with you?
- They'd like to, but we don't allow it.

705
01:24:40,983 --> 01:24:44,612
At times, though, the little one
sneaks into our room...

706
01:24:44,821 --> 01:24:48,279
...and jumps in bed
between his mother and I.

707
01:24:48,491 --> 01:24:51,392
He takes her finger
and squeezes it really hard.

708
01:24:52,396 --> 01:24:58,596
You can't imagine how sweet it is
to fall asleep with a child next to you.

709
01:25:10,017 --> 01:25:12,918
Have you known Steiner
for a long time?

710
01:25:13,122 --> 01:25:18,287
Yes, but we've only seen each other
three or four times. But...

711
01:25:39,386 --> 01:25:43,288
Marcello, one day you too
will have a house like this.

712
01:25:52,769 --> 01:25:57,638
We get on well together, don't we?
We're made for each other.

713
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:28,043
- Let me come here more often.
- I told you, you can come anytime.

714
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:30,810
What is it, Marcello?

715
01:26:31,650 --> 01:26:36,087
I should change environment.
I should change many things.

716
01:26:38,225 --> 01:26:39,988
Your house is a real refuge.

717
01:26:40,193 --> 01:26:44,152
Your children, your wife, your books,
your extraordinary friends...

718
01:26:44,364 --> 01:26:47,765
Me, I'm wasting time.
I won't manage anything anymore.

719
01:26:47,968 --> 01:26:52,268
Once I had ambitions,
but maybe I'm losing everything.

720
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:54,336
I forgot everything.

721
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:59,277
Don't think that safety is being locked
up in one's home. Don't do what I did.

722
01:27:00,317 --> 01:27:06,017
I'm too serious to be an amateur, but
not enough to be a professional. There.

723
01:27:07,491 --> 01:27:10,949
A more miserable life
is better, believe me...

724
01:27:11,163 --> 01:27:15,725
...than an existence protected
by an organized society...

725
01:27:15,934 --> 01:27:19,165
...where everything is calculated,
everything is perfect.

726
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:26,445
Marcello, I can only be your friend,
therefore I can't give you any advice.

727
01:27:26,648 --> 01:27:28,081
But if you want my help...

728
01:27:28,284 --> 01:27:31,720
...I can have you meet an editor
who can give you a decent job...

729
01:27:31,921 --> 01:27:36,119
...and give you the chance to focus
on what interests you more.

730
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:40,393
It's always better than writing
for those half-fascist papers, no?

731
01:27:40,598 --> 01:27:43,965
Do you want to think about it
and discuss it later?

732
01:27:44,335 --> 01:27:45,393
Yes.

733
01:27:52,245 --> 01:27:53,212
Come.

734
01:29:04,332 --> 01:29:09,964
Sometimes at night this darkness,
this silence, weighs on me.

735
01:29:11,740 --> 01:29:13,935
Peace frightens me.

736
01:29:14,243 --> 01:29:17,679
I'm afraid of peace more than
anything else. To me it seems...

737
01:29:17,882 --> 01:29:22,751
...that it's only an outer shell
and that hell is hiding behind it.

738
01:29:22,954 --> 01:29:26,048
I think of what my children
will see tomorrow.

739
01:29:26,692 --> 01:29:28,990
"The world will be wonderful," they say.

740
01:29:29,194 --> 01:29:32,163
From what point of view?
When a phone call...

741
01:29:32,365 --> 01:29:35,061
...can announce the end of the world.

742
01:29:35,802 --> 01:29:39,329
One should live outside of passions,
beyond emotions...

743
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:42,976
...in that harmony you find
in completed artworks...

744
01:29:43,177 --> 01:29:45,941
...in that enchanted order.

745
01:29:47,483 --> 01:29:50,611
We should learn to love each other
so much...

746
01:29:50,821 --> 01:29:54,621
...to live outside of time, detached...

747
01:29:57,662 --> 01:29:59,857
Detached.

748
01:30:02,533 --> 01:30:02,555
I

749
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:11,606
I can't spend my life calling you
on the phone!

750
01:30:12,477 --> 01:30:15,674
I want to work in peace!
I don't know!

751
01:30:15,881 --> 01:30:18,714
Miss, could you please
shut off that music?

752
01:30:21,221 --> 01:30:23,849
No, I won't tell you where I am.
I don't know when I'll be back!

753
01:30:24,058 --> 01:30:27,653
Go to hell!
Wretched madwoman.

754
01:30:47,987 --> 01:30:50,683
Quit it with that little voice,
will you?

755
01:30:52,159 --> 01:30:55,458
- Paola, this is broken.
- Go get another one, then.

756
01:30:55,662 --> 01:30:59,894
- Are you having anything to eat?
- No. Yes... I don't know.

757
01:31:00,569 --> 01:31:02,400
The food is good, you know.

758
01:31:08,444 --> 01:31:12,938
- Is it difficult to type?
- Do you want to be a typist?

759
01:31:13,282 --> 01:31:15,113
I'd like to.

760
01:31:15,486 --> 01:31:19,252
- You're a pretty girl, you know?
- Pretty, you're exaggerating!

761
01:31:20,025 --> 01:31:22,823
Come on, you know very well
that you're pretty.

762
01:31:23,028 --> 01:31:25,724
- Okay.
- Paola, this one's broken too.

763
01:31:25,999 --> 01:31:29,162
You're not from Rome.
Where are you from?

764
01:31:29,770 --> 01:31:33,433
- I'm from Umbria, near Perugia.
- Why did you come here?

765
01:31:33,642 --> 01:31:36,110
My father works in Anzio,
that's why I came here.

766
01:31:36,311 --> 01:31:39,906
After Christmas, though, I'm either
going to Ostia or to Rome.

767
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:44,248
- Who is he? Your brother?
- No, he's my helper.

768
01:31:44,455 --> 01:31:46,719
Wow, they treat you well here.

769
01:31:46,924 --> 01:31:50,621
Well, yes, they treat me well,
but I don't like it much.

770
01:31:50,829 --> 01:31:52,820
I can't wait to go home.

771
01:31:53,098 --> 01:31:55,566
Sunday I saw a car
with Perugia license plates...

772
01:31:55,768 --> 01:31:59,431
...and I felt so homesick
that I could've cried.

773
01:32:02,242 --> 01:32:03,504
Let's see your profile.

774
01:32:03,910 --> 01:32:05,309
- Why?
- Let's see it.

775
01:32:05,513 --> 01:32:07,913
- But why?
- Come on, one second.

776
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:11,113
You look like one of those little angels...

777
01:32:11,319 --> 01:32:13,219
...from the paintings
of an Umbrian church.

778
01:32:13,422 --> 01:32:15,788
- They've already told you, huh?
- No.

779
01:32:15,991 --> 01:32:17,390
Why are you laughing?

780
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:18,855
No reason.

781
01:32:20,496 --> 01:32:24,398
- Do you have a boyfriend?
- Yeah, right, a boyfriend.

782
01:32:31,811 --> 01:32:33,142
You're not writing anymore?

783
01:32:35,615 --> 01:32:38,812
- Then can I turn the music back on?
- Yes, sure.

784
01:32:40,388 --> 01:32:42,856
You want to throw out
this piece of paper too?

785
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:25,531
What do you want?

786
01:33:31,048 --> 01:33:34,211
- Marcello, your father is here.
- My father?

787
01:33:34,418 --> 01:33:38,218
- Over there. He said he was your father.
- Come on, don't joke around.

788
01:33:38,422 --> 01:33:43,553
He's over there, eating at that table.
He's been looking for you for two hours.

789
01:33:43,797 --> 01:33:45,822
Didn't he say he was his father?

790
01:33:48,936 --> 01:33:51,837
Marcello, it's true,
he's at that table over there.

791
01:33:52,039 --> 01:33:54,564
- Where?
- Next to the black man.

792
01:34:07,927 --> 01:34:10,862
Dad. Dad!

793
01:34:12,432 --> 01:34:15,993
Marcello! Finally.

794
01:34:16,204 --> 01:34:18,536
I arrived in Rome this morning.

795
01:34:18,739 --> 01:34:21,640
I looked for you everywhere:
At home, at work.

796
01:34:21,944 --> 01:34:25,675
I was about to leave when a friend
of yours told me to wait for you here.

797
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,108
Yes, Paparazzo.

798
01:34:27,315 --> 01:34:32,116
With my line of work, I run around
all day, Dad. I only go home to sleep.

799
01:34:32,354 --> 01:34:33,651
How come you're in Rome?

800
01:34:33,856 --> 01:34:37,417
To solicit that damn case
at the Ministry.

801
01:34:37,628 --> 01:34:40,961
Everything gets shelved here.
Anyway, you look well.

802
01:34:41,265 --> 01:34:42,698
- You look well too.
- I'm okay.

803
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:44,629
And how's Mother?

804
01:34:44,836 --> 01:34:46,827
She gave me a letter for you.

805
01:34:47,038 --> 01:34:50,565
She's well, but always worrying,
you know. She's always been that way.

806
01:34:50,776 --> 01:34:54,507
And with age, these things get worse.
Here it is.

807
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,978
Poor Mother.

808
01:34:57,185 --> 01:35:00,677
But really, you could
write more often, son...

809
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:02,881
...and even come once in a while.

810
01:35:03,092 --> 01:35:05,617
- You haven't been home in a long time.
- I know, but here...

811
01:35:05,829 --> 01:35:07,854
- Hi, Marcello.
- Hi.

812
01:35:08,566 --> 01:35:10,363
- She said hello.
- Yes.

813
01:35:10,568 --> 01:35:12,399
- Is she an actress?
- What?

814
01:35:12,604 --> 01:35:16,563
She wishes. She's a two-bit extra.
An actress!

815
01:35:17,910 --> 01:35:20,208
Do you want a drink, Dad?
You want a gin-fizz?

816
01:35:20,412 --> 01:35:23,939
What? A "gin-fritz"?
No, my beer is just fine.

817
01:35:26,220 --> 01:35:30,418
Hell of a hustle here at night!
Is it like this every night?

818
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:35,994
- Yes.
- In our town, it's pretty sad at this hour.

819
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:41,028
- Are you well here? Have you adjusted?
- Well, yes. It's been a while now.

820
01:35:41,470 --> 01:35:43,631
How's work going? Is it fruitful?

821
01:35:43,940 --> 01:35:48,206
If you're a good journalist, it can be
pretty fruitful. I've been lucky.

822
01:35:48,412 --> 01:35:52,508
- Now I know everyone, I can get around.
- Really?

823
01:35:52,718 --> 01:35:55,118
I have a car, that one over there,
an apartment...

824
01:35:55,321 --> 01:35:56,310
By the way...

825
01:35:56,523 --> 01:35:59,117
...every time I called, some woman
answered the phone.

826
01:35:59,326 --> 01:36:00,520
- Who's she?
- What?

827
01:36:00,727 --> 01:36:02,456
I won't say anything,
you're a man now...

828
01:36:02,663 --> 01:36:06,565
...just don't do anything foolish.
Having fun is fine, we're not saints...

829
01:36:06,768 --> 01:36:10,033
...but marriage is something serious.
When someone lives with you...

830
01:36:10,238 --> 01:36:15,073
No, no, Dad, I understand.
You spoke with the cleaning lady.

831
01:36:16,546 --> 01:36:19,344
- Good evening. You finally found him.
- Yes, thanks.

832
01:36:19,651 --> 01:36:22,643
- You've already met my father, right?
- Sure. We're friends.

833
01:36:22,854 --> 01:36:25,322
Yes, he's the one who told me
to wait for you here.

834
01:36:25,524 --> 01:36:28,254
Are you a photographer?
A photo reporter!

835
01:36:28,561 --> 01:36:32,622
Interesting work.
Artistic work, in some ways.

836
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:34,357
Do you work with my son?

837
01:36:34,569 --> 01:36:37,163
- Unfortunately, yes, I got gypped.
- That's a good one!

838
01:36:37,372 --> 01:36:39,602
Do you have any idea
where the prince is?

839
01:36:39,807 --> 01:36:42,298
I was about to bust him,
but he got away.

840
01:36:42,578 --> 01:36:45,877
- I'm going to take a look around. Bye.
- Maybe you guys are busy.

841
01:36:46,081 --> 01:36:50,142
- No, we're not, Dad.
- You can tell me if you have to go.

842
01:36:50,453 --> 01:36:53,115
- There's work here too.
- Really?

843
01:36:53,758 --> 01:36:57,751
You know, important people come here,
they make news, we take pictures...

844
01:36:57,962 --> 01:37:00,157
- My paper is up there.
- I see.

845
01:37:00,564 --> 01:37:03,624
Well, you just sit here, then?

846
01:37:05,138 --> 01:37:06,571
Shall we go to the cinema?

847
01:37:06,773 --> 01:37:11,540
No, I always go to the cinema.
At home, there's nothing else to do.

848
01:37:11,745 --> 01:37:16,682
It doesn't matter. No, I'll leave you
alone now. You guys are young...

849
01:37:16,886 --> 01:37:19,377
No, Dad, we don't have a thing to do.

850
01:37:19,722 --> 01:37:25,490
Why, what can we do? I mean, just for
a couple of hours before going to bed.

851
01:37:25,762 --> 01:37:27,923
There are only nightclubs at this hour.

852
01:37:28,132 --> 01:37:31,192
By the way, a friend of mine
who was here told me...

853
01:37:31,403 --> 01:37:35,237
...about a place that's not too bad.
Some sort of cabaret...

854
01:37:35,575 --> 01:37:37,907
The Chit Chat... The Ca Ca...

855
01:37:38,111 --> 01:37:40,341
The Cha Cha!
That's an old club.

856
01:37:40,547 --> 01:37:43,243
- The Cha Cha, right!
- Do you want to go there?

857
01:37:43,450 --> 01:37:48,945
I mean, just to take a look.
Since I'm not here that often.

858
01:37:49,157 --> 01:37:52,786
- Paparazzo!
- Good. Invite your friend too.

859
01:37:52,994 --> 01:37:57,954
- No, no, no. I'm paying here.
- No, Dad, come on... Okay.

860
01:37:58,167 --> 01:38:00,658
- Antonio, come here.
- Waiter!

861
01:38:01,572 --> 01:38:03,199
Paparazzo!

862
01:38:04,575 --> 01:38:06,475
- Come on, let's go with my father!
- Where?

863
01:38:06,678 --> 01:38:09,772
- Let's go!
- Hey, what about the prince?

864
01:38:09,981 --> 01:38:14,509
Oh, I see. You pay everything
together here. That's okay.

865
01:38:14,820 --> 01:38:18,256
Paparazzo, hurry, get in the car.
This way, Dad.

866
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:20,290
- Let's go!
- Where are we going?

867
01:38:20,495 --> 01:38:24,454
- We're going to the Cha Cha Cha.
- Marcello, but...

868
01:38:24,666 --> 01:38:26,896
- Take yours, then.
- I'll do the scoop myself.

869
01:38:27,102 --> 01:38:29,570
Tell the editor-in-chief
I'll call him at home.

870
01:38:29,773 --> 01:38:34,733
- Get busy, boys! Bye, Mariella.
- Paparazzo, see you at the morgue!

871
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:58,932
- Is this table okay, gentlemen?
- Nothing has changed.

872
01:38:59,141 --> 01:39:01,905
It's just like I remember it.
Unbelievable.

873
01:39:02,344 --> 01:39:07,111
- Were you here in 1922?
- No, I was in Turin.

874
01:39:07,317 --> 01:39:10,286
- I've been here for a couple of years.
- Oh, good.

875
01:39:19,831 --> 01:39:21,696
Would you like something
to drink, Dad?

876
01:39:21,901 --> 01:39:23,300
Of course I want to drink!

877
01:39:23,503 --> 01:39:25,368
- Do you want a whiskey?
- Yes.

878
01:39:25,573 --> 01:39:28,064
Fine. Bring us three glasses
of whiskey, please.

879
01:39:28,276 --> 01:39:31,143
- Sure. Which brand?
- Black & White.

880
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:34,947
Why don't we do a nice report for
the paper in here? It's like a cemetery.

881
01:39:35,150 --> 01:39:38,677
She's beautiful.
She's got those long legs.

882
01:39:38,888 --> 01:39:41,686
- What?
- He said she has long legs.

883
01:39:41,891 --> 01:39:43,756
- Have you been to Paris?
- No.

884
01:39:43,962 --> 01:39:45,759
I went there a couple of times.

885
01:39:45,964 --> 01:39:50,094
Once, in a cabaret like this one,
there was a beautiful girl...

886
01:39:50,302 --> 01:39:52,668
...she had long legs like that one.

887
01:39:52,870 --> 01:39:58,399
She stripped, and once naked,
we discovered she was a guy!

888
01:39:59,914 --> 01:40:02,678
- Do you have a father?
- Yes, I do.

889
01:40:02,883 --> 01:40:06,182
He must be young, you're just a kid.
What does he do?

890
01:40:06,388 --> 01:40:11,451
Nothing, he's a drifter. He does nothing
all day. He just gives my mother grief.

891
01:40:11,662 --> 01:40:15,996
He sings, he whistles, he'd like to go
to the cinema but has no money.

892
01:40:16,200 --> 01:40:18,532
- No, it's not true, Dad.
- Well, it could be.

893
01:40:51,809 --> 01:40:54,141
Hey, Paparazzo. Isn't that Fanny?

894
01:41:05,491 --> 01:41:08,949
- Lilly, look who's here.
- He's something!

895
01:41:17,272 --> 01:41:20,264
I'm still waiting for the picture
in your paper. You jerk.

896
01:41:20,476 --> 01:41:22,376
And you're just beautiful!

897
01:41:22,578 --> 01:41:24,569
- What's her name?
- Fanny.

898
01:41:24,782 --> 01:41:27,342
- You know her well?
- He sure does!

899
01:41:27,552 --> 01:41:30,453
- She's French.
- Pleasant girl.

900
01:41:30,789 --> 01:41:32,484
So she's French.

901
01:41:42,803 --> 01:41:44,395
Liar.

902
01:41:44,605 --> 01:41:47,438
Joker. Swindler.

903
01:41:47,642 --> 01:41:49,837
How can you go out
with friends like him?

904
01:41:50,045 --> 01:41:52,104
- He's my father.
- Yeah, sure!

905
01:41:52,314 --> 01:41:54,805
- She doesn't believe it, Dad.
- No?

906
01:41:55,652 --> 01:41:57,813
- Really?
- Yes.

907
01:41:58,021 --> 01:42:01,479
- Good evening, miss.
- Good evening, sir.

908
01:42:04,495 --> 01:42:08,090
- Good job.
- It's because I promised her a photo...

909
01:42:08,299 --> 01:42:11,598
...but she's a nice girl.
- I don't doubt it.

910
01:42:11,804 --> 01:42:14,034
- Shall we invite her to the table?
- Why not?

911
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:19,610
Let's invite her. In that case, boys,
let's order a bottle of champagne.

912
01:42:19,813 --> 01:42:23,340
- What? An orange juice will be fine.
- No, champagne is fine.

913
01:42:23,552 --> 01:42:26,248
- Champagne is okay, Dad.
- Let's order the best!

914
01:42:26,456 --> 01:42:29,516
I know what I'm talking about.
I am a connoisseur.

915
01:42:29,926 --> 01:42:32,451
I sold champagne to half of Italy!

916
01:42:32,797 --> 01:42:35,265
Meanwhile, have a drop of whiskey.

917
01:42:57,826 --> 01:42:59,691
Cheers to you.

918
01:43:02,298 --> 01:43:04,493
- Cheers to you, Dad.
- Thanks.

919
01:43:09,906 --> 01:43:12,340
- Good!
- Yes, it's good.

920
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:21,878
- Did you order the champagne?
- Of course.

921
01:43:22,088 --> 01:43:25,683
Here. It comes with the waitress!
What more do you want?

922
01:43:26,026 --> 01:43:28,392
- Fanny. No, don't bother.
- My pleasure.

923
01:43:28,597 --> 01:43:31,395
I'm not saying hello to you.
You either.

924
01:43:31,600 --> 01:43:35,536
- See how your son works? Nice job!
- I see, I see.

925
01:43:35,906 --> 01:43:39,307
Send him back to his hometown!

926
01:43:39,510 --> 01:43:42,104
- Tell me, you're not his father, are you?
- Sure, I am!

927
01:43:42,313 --> 01:43:43,871
It's not possible.
You're too young!

928
01:43:44,082 --> 01:43:47,518
Oh, please, miss,
let's not talk about age.

929
01:43:47,719 --> 01:43:52,884
"Don't awaken desperate sorrow,
because my heart would suffer!"

930
01:43:53,226 --> 01:43:56,252
I'll tell you, it's boredom that ages us.

931
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:59,057
I traveled a lot for business
as a young man.

932
01:43:59,267 --> 01:44:01,462
When I was on the road,
I felt like a lion.

933
01:44:01,669 --> 01:44:07,005
Even now, when I travel, I can keep up
with any of these young men...

934
01:44:07,209 --> 01:44:10,975
...but at home, it's as though I were 80.

935
01:44:11,180 --> 01:44:15,446
What are you doing? You can use
your abilities to open a bottle of Coke.

936
01:44:15,652 --> 01:44:18,143
But I'll take care of the champagne.

937
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,993
Quiet. Look.

938
01:44:29,068 --> 01:44:33,334
It's so beautiful.
It always makes me cry.

939
01:44:34,108 --> 01:44:37,043
Yes, it makes me cry.

940
01:45:07,115 --> 01:45:09,811
Miss, your champagne.

941
01:45:12,021 --> 01:45:17,755
To your beautiful legs,
which I greatly admire. Cheers.

942
01:46:13,995 --> 01:46:16,020
Good, very good.

943
01:46:16,231 --> 01:46:20,691
But we have to drink another drop.
Yes, we do.

944
01:46:22,404 --> 01:46:25,931
First I toasted to your beautiful legs...

945
01:46:26,341 --> 01:46:28,639
...now we must toast...

946
01:46:33,750 --> 01:46:36,651
I wasn't going to say
anything scandalous.

947
01:46:37,054 --> 01:46:39,488
Your father is much funnier
than you are.

948
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:42,022
- Much, much funnier!
- Come on.

949
01:46:42,227 --> 01:46:45,355
Oh, please, miss. Don't be silly.

950
01:46:45,832 --> 01:46:50,826
I want to teach you a difficult game.
Let's see if you can do it as well.

951
01:46:51,238 --> 01:46:55,334
Pay attention.
You put a coin on your forehead...

952
01:46:55,543 --> 01:46:57,909
...and you make it fall
without touching your nose.

953
01:46:58,115 --> 01:47:01,983
- But this is easy. A baby could do it.
- Want to try?

954
01:47:02,185 --> 01:47:06,281
Let's take a coin
and put it on your forehead.

955
01:47:06,491 --> 01:47:09,927
There. Let's see.
Let's see you do it.

956
01:47:10,762 --> 01:47:13,128
- Wait, wait.
- I'm waiting.

957
01:47:15,735 --> 01:47:17,566
Wait, perhaps...

958
01:47:20,975 --> 01:47:26,379
You got me!
Now I tell you a joke...

959
01:47:26,581 --> 01:47:29,448
...a nice little story.

960
01:47:31,219 --> 01:47:36,122
Look, it's a story about a woman who
sends her husband to the market...

961
01:47:36,325 --> 01:47:42,025
...to buy three shirts,
six pairs of handkerchiefs and...

962
01:47:42,266 --> 01:47:45,667
...what do you call this for women?

963
01:47:46,037 --> 01:47:47,698
Brassiere.

964
01:47:49,108 --> 01:47:55,411
So along the way, the man drinks
some wine and forgets everything.

965
01:47:55,615 --> 01:47:59,107
- When he gets home, the teacher says...
- The teacher?

966
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,686
- The wife.
- The wife, come on, Paparazzo.

967
01:48:01,889 --> 01:48:04,517
"Well, did you take care
of my business?"

968
01:48:04,725 --> 01:48:07,922
"I got everything," he answers and takes
out his handkerchief and she says:

969
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:10,860
"Where are the handkerchiefs?"
"Here they are!"

970
01:48:11,068 --> 01:48:15,198
"One, two, three, four, five, six."

971
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:20,776
"Where are the shirts?" she asks.
"Here they are, dear. One, two."

972
01:48:20,979 --> 01:48:23,641
Then she says,
"And where is the brassiere?"

973
01:48:23,850 --> 01:48:25,681
"Wait, I bought a brassiere.
It's here.

974
01:48:25,886 --> 01:48:27,911
I got it, I got it.

975
01:48:28,122 --> 01:48:29,714
Here it is!"

976
01:48:32,126 --> 01:48:35,789
- But you don't need one.
- Dad!

977
01:48:35,998 --> 01:48:37,966
Well, she's so beautiful!

978
01:48:39,067 --> 01:48:42,594
Hey, there is no more champagne.
We have to order some more.

979
01:48:42,806 --> 01:48:44,774
Waiter!

980
01:48:51,515 --> 01:48:53,415
This is a waltz.

981
01:48:53,618 --> 01:48:55,210
I've half a mind to...

982
01:48:55,419 --> 01:48:58,252
- Miss, may I have this dance?
- Here I am.

983
01:48:58,457 --> 01:49:00,516
I'm ready too.

984
01:49:02,528 --> 01:49:05,156
What's wrong?
I can manage. I can manage.

985
01:49:16,212 --> 01:49:18,442
You know that when I was a boy...

986
01:49:18,648 --> 01:49:20,513
Paparazzo. Here you go.

987
01:49:21,151 --> 01:49:23,346
When I was a boy,
my father was never at home.

988
01:49:23,554 --> 01:49:27,217
He'd stay away one week, 20 days.
He never came back.

989
01:49:28,928 --> 01:49:31,522
How my mother cried.

990
01:49:31,965 --> 01:49:36,664
I almost never saw him.
I don't really know him.

991
01:49:38,907 --> 01:49:41,899
But I was glad to see him
again tonight.

992
01:49:42,643 --> 01:49:44,736
- He's fun, huh?
- Yes, very.

993
01:49:44,946 --> 01:49:48,006
You have to show him
a good time tonight.

994
01:49:49,151 --> 01:49:50,118
Yes, but...

995
01:49:52,723 --> 01:49:55,191
Maybe this isn't the way
you dance this.

996
01:49:55,392 --> 01:49:57,690
No, don't worry.
I like it better this way.

997
01:49:57,895 --> 01:50:01,456
Oh, yeah? Then let's dance!

998
01:50:02,267 --> 01:50:04,861
- What extraordinary eyes.
- Oh, yeah?

999
01:50:05,071 --> 01:50:09,235
- I'm not sure how to take this.
- It's a sign of my infinite admiration.

1000
01:50:09,442 --> 01:50:12,468
I'm afraid you're just like your son.

1001
01:50:12,679 --> 01:50:14,772
- How am I? Like my son?
- Yes!

1002
01:50:14,982 --> 01:50:17,416
We must be of the same breed, then.

1003
01:50:22,459 --> 01:50:26,190
No, no, no.
You, daddy, come with me!

1004
01:50:26,463 --> 01:50:28,590
Marcello, follow me!

1005
01:50:29,667 --> 01:50:34,104
Be careful, I go very quickly,
even if I don't have an English car.

1006
01:50:34,839 --> 01:50:38,070
You really want to go to her place
to eat spaghetti?

1007
01:50:38,277 --> 01:50:42,873
Yes, yes, he wants to eat spaghetti
Bolognese with me. Go away.

1008
01:50:43,082 --> 01:50:44,106
Here I am!

1009
01:50:44,318 --> 01:50:47,048
Are you comfortable on my carriage?

1010
01:50:47,254 --> 01:50:49,279
- Listen, Dad...
- What is it?

1011
01:50:49,757 --> 01:50:52,419
...is everything all right?
- Yes, I'm in great company.

1012
01:50:52,627 --> 01:50:54,458
- Leave me alone.
- Say, can you drive?

1013
01:50:54,662 --> 01:50:57,790
If you made love the way I drive,
you'd be very happy.

1014
01:50:59,402 --> 01:51:02,394
- Be quiet! Be a good girl.
- You'll wake everybody up!

1015
01:51:04,408 --> 01:51:06,137
Don't go too fast!

1016
01:51:17,725 --> 01:51:17,747
I

1017
01:51:32,274 --> 01:51:35,471
My father is still a good-looking man,
isn't he?

1018
01:51:43,855 --> 01:51:45,789
Gloria, wake up. We're here.

1019
01:51:46,992 --> 01:51:51,156
You took the longest way, you know.
Oh, my foot!

1020
01:51:51,532 --> 01:51:54,296
Why did it take so long?

1021
01:51:54,701 --> 01:51:57,727
- Well, you're not getting out?
- No, I'm not coming.

1022
01:51:57,939 --> 01:51:59,531
Why? What are you, busy?

1023
01:51:59,740 --> 01:52:03,267
I'm tired. Actually, Paparazzo,
you know what?

1024
01:52:03,580 --> 01:52:06,071
I'll leave you the car.
Take my father home.

1025
01:52:06,282 --> 01:52:07,749
Come on, now.

1026
01:52:07,951 --> 01:52:13,321
Listen, tell him I had to stop by
the printing house...

1027
01:52:13,524 --> 01:52:16,049
...and to call me in the morning
before he leaves.

1028
01:52:16,794 --> 01:52:18,489
Come on, why don't you come?

1029
01:52:18,697 --> 01:52:23,566
I don't feel like it. I want to take a walk
in this area. I don't know it very well.

1030
01:52:30,477 --> 01:52:33,275
Where have you been?
I got here half an hour ago!

1031
01:52:37,553 --> 01:52:40,351
- Marcello, your father is sick!
- What?

1032
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:43,551
He got sick.
Maybe he drank too much.

1033
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:46,456
- I was going to the pharmacy.
- You left him alone?

1034
01:52:46,664 --> 01:52:48,894
He wants these drops
he wrote down.

1035
01:52:49,535 --> 01:52:52,299
Paparazzo, run to the pharmacy
and get these drops!

1036
01:52:52,504 --> 01:52:54,472
- What?
- Hurry!

1037
01:53:01,448 --> 01:53:03,643
- What floor?
- Third.

1038
01:53:15,831 --> 01:53:17,594
Which door? What's the number?

1039
01:53:17,801 --> 01:53:20,793
Don't scream.
It's a respectable building.

1040
01:53:30,951 --> 01:53:32,145
Father.

1041
01:53:33,854 --> 01:53:35,879
- Turn off the light.
- Yes.

1042
01:53:36,757 --> 01:53:38,588
- Where's the light?
- Over there.

1043
01:53:43,065 --> 01:53:44,589
Wait there.

1044
01:53:45,635 --> 01:53:49,002
My friend went to the pharmacy.
He'll be right back.

1045
01:53:49,939 --> 01:53:53,670
It's nothing. Maybe I drank
a little too much.

1046
01:53:53,877 --> 01:53:56,175
Of course it's nothing.

1047
01:54:00,018 --> 01:54:03,146
You want a glass of water?

1048
01:54:03,623 --> 01:54:06,285
No, no. It'll pass, it'll pass.

1049
01:54:17,438 --> 01:54:20,407
- What happened?
- I don't know. He got sick.

1050
01:54:20,609 --> 01:54:23,976
I was really scared.
Marcello is here now.

1051
01:54:28,386 --> 01:54:32,846
- Can I go in to make some coffee?
- No, he said to wait here.

1052
01:54:45,340 --> 01:54:48,707
What neighborhood is this?
Where are we?

1053
01:54:49,110 --> 01:54:50,907
It is the Italian neighborhood.

1054
01:54:51,479 --> 01:54:54,505
I've never heard of it.
Is it far?

1055
01:54:56,385 --> 01:54:58,444
When I used to come to Rome...

1056
01:54:58,655 --> 01:55:03,251
...I always went to a hotel
close to Piazza Fiume.

1057
01:55:09,335 --> 01:55:11,166
What time is it?

1058
01:55:12,171 --> 01:55:13,638
Almost 4 a.m.

1059
01:55:13,839 --> 01:55:16,399
There's a train at 5:30 a.m.

1060
01:55:16,776 --> 01:55:18,710
I'll have to take that one.

1061
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:22,143
I can make it.
Yes, I can make it.

1062
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:26,548
Listen, Dad, why don't you come
to my place. You can rest a bit.

1063
01:55:26,756 --> 01:55:31,318
No, no, no. I'd rather leave.
So I'll be home by 10 a.m.

1064
01:55:31,527 --> 01:55:33,791
- Oh, my watch.
- You can leave later.

1065
01:55:33,997 --> 01:55:35,294
No, no.

1066
01:55:36,867 --> 01:55:39,597
I feel better. I feel a lot better.

1067
01:55:39,803 --> 01:55:44,137
Why don't you stay tomorrow
as well, Dad? Please, stay.

1068
01:55:44,343 --> 01:55:48,575
If you don't want to stay at my place,
maybe you'd prefer your hotel.

1069
01:55:48,782 --> 01:55:50,409
What's the name of it?

1070
01:55:51,485 --> 01:55:55,478
I'll skip work tomorrow and
we can be together all day.

1071
01:55:55,924 --> 01:55:57,619
We can talk, we can...

1072
01:55:59,795 --> 01:56:01,888
We never see each other.

1073
01:56:05,703 --> 01:56:08,570
I have to go. I have to go.

1074
01:56:11,676 --> 01:56:13,735
That's the taxi.

1075
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:21,251
- Marcello, the taxi is here.
- Which taxi?

1076
01:56:21,453 --> 01:56:25,583
I called it. Where's my hat?

1077
01:56:26,527 --> 01:56:31,294
We could send the taxi away.
Please, go downstairs one moment.

1078
01:56:32,966 --> 01:56:37,164
- Don't leave.
- I want to leave, I want to go home.

1079
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:46,807
- Good evening, miss.
- Goodbye and lots of luck. Goodbye.

1080
01:56:47,018 --> 01:56:48,485
Bye, Marcello.

1081
01:56:48,686 --> 01:56:52,588
Well, son, I'm happy to have seen you.
Write to us.

1082
01:56:54,060 --> 01:56:59,123
No, don't accompany me.
I prefer going alone, please.

1083
01:57:30,134 --> 01:57:31,328
I'll break your face!

1084
01:57:35,574 --> 01:57:39,374
Think everyone's like her husband, who
gets cuckolded and doesn't complain?!

1085
01:57:39,580 --> 01:57:42,048
He's showing off because
there are women around.

1086
01:57:42,251 --> 01:57:44,276
- What did you say?
- What's going on?

1087
01:57:44,486 --> 01:57:47,011
I don't know, but it was great.
I'll find out.

1088
01:57:47,222 --> 01:57:48,246
Good, find out.

1089
01:57:48,458 --> 01:57:50,756
The fact remains that
what he wrote is true.

1090
01:57:50,960 --> 01:57:55,021
- Come back here, you ugly bastard!
- My mother has lots of money!

1091
01:57:55,233 --> 01:57:57,360
- Nico.
- Marcellino!

1092
01:57:57,569 --> 01:58:00,504
- Bad boy Marcellino!
- How are you?

1093
01:58:00,706 --> 01:58:02,640
- Where are you going?
- To my fiance's castle...

1094
01:58:02,842 --> 01:58:07,279
...in Bassano di Sutri.
- Why don't you take me?

1095
01:58:07,482 --> 01:58:09,313
- Sure.
- Paparazzo was looking for you...

1096
01:58:09,517 --> 01:58:11,485
...he wanted to do a shoot
for Jardin de Mode.

1097
01:58:11,686 --> 01:58:14,883
I haven't taken fashion pictures
in a year. I've had it.

1098
01:58:15,089 --> 01:58:18,081
- Nicolina!
- There they are!

1099
01:58:20,429 --> 01:58:22,454
Nicolina, we're here!

1100
01:58:22,667 --> 01:58:24,658
Is there room for my friend and I?

1101
01:58:24,869 --> 01:58:27,201
- No, try in the other car.
- What a shame.

1102
01:58:28,506 --> 01:58:29,939
See you there. Bye.

1103
01:58:31,809 --> 01:58:35,267
Stop. Is there room
for two unhappy creatures?

1104
01:58:36,515 --> 01:58:40,451
- There is a bigger car behind us.
- Oh, my God.

1105
01:58:42,622 --> 01:58:45,819
Stop, Oliviero.
Can my friend come too?

1106
01:58:46,026 --> 01:58:48,859
- The usual pimps you fall in love with.
- Come, come.

1107
01:58:49,063 --> 01:58:51,361
As soon as we're out of Rome,
you're driving.

1108
01:58:51,567 --> 01:58:54,001
After Capranica,
the olive grove shortcut.

1109
01:58:54,203 --> 01:58:56,569
Follow us!

1110
01:59:05,183 --> 01:59:07,276
Will there still be people
at your father's house?

1111
01:59:07,586 --> 01:59:10,054
Let's hope not,
so we can go to bed early.

1112
01:59:10,255 --> 01:59:12,689
Anyway, only the fossils
must be left at this hour.

1113
01:59:12,892 --> 01:59:18,421
The parties at our house are famous
for being first-class funerals.

1114
01:59:19,468 --> 01:59:21,129
Is your brother hunting?

1115
01:59:21,336 --> 01:59:25,670
- Irene, take this dog-looking thing back.
- Give it to me.

1116
01:59:27,110 --> 01:59:30,170
I woke up and my bed started to shake,

1117
01:59:30,914 --> 01:59:33,212
- What town are we going to?
- Maybe I was just being nervous,

1118
01:59:34,385 --> 01:59:38,754
- What town are we going to?
- Anyway, Bassano di Sutri,

1119
01:59:41,193 --> 01:59:43,058
I am probably going
to be visited by more ghosts,

1120
01:59:43,262 --> 01:59:46,425
Why are you crying? What language
is that? Where are you from?

1121
01:59:46,633 --> 01:59:48,601
Eskimo!

1122
02:00:05,055 --> 02:00:05,077
I

1123
02:00:09,927 --> 02:00:12,657
Beautiful night to all of you!

1124
02:00:19,672 --> 02:00:22,641
What are you doing?
Where are you going with that?

1125
02:00:23,410 --> 02:00:28,438
Careful not to spill everything.
I don't get the meaning of this walk.

1126
02:00:28,650 --> 02:00:31,949
- Hi, Clemente.
- Giulio, look who I brought.

1127
02:00:36,059 --> 02:00:38,027
You big slut.

1128
02:00:42,065 --> 02:00:44,124
Who told you to come here?

1129
02:00:57,417 --> 02:00:59,681
They came from all regions of Italy.

1130
02:00:59,887 --> 02:01:04,017
We were all there. It was a beautiful,
touching ceremony.

1131
02:01:04,258 --> 02:01:09,093
The people bringing flowers
to the tomb of their beloved leader.

1132
02:01:09,297 --> 02:01:11,265
Excuse me. I haven't had
the pleasure of meeting you.

1133
02:01:11,467 --> 02:01:12,764
- I'm the youngest son.
- Rubini, my pleasure.

1134
02:01:13,069 --> 02:01:15,037
The least important, of course.

1135
02:01:16,273 --> 02:01:20,505
You want to meet someone else from
the family? Or have you had enough?

1136
02:01:20,712 --> 02:01:24,113
- Grandma. Grandma!
- No, don't bother.

1137
02:01:24,316 --> 02:01:25,840
Grandma!

1138
02:01:27,253 --> 02:01:30,620
- I'd like you to meet Mr...
- Rubini, pleased to meet you.

1139
02:01:30,992 --> 02:01:32,084
Good, good.

1140
02:01:32,293 --> 02:01:34,989
She's pretending to be asleep
so she doesn't have to talk.

1141
02:01:35,196 --> 02:01:37,721
Let's continue the genealogical tree.

1142
02:01:37,932 --> 02:01:42,892
Father, meet Mr. Rubini, someone
who looks like he has a real job.

1143
02:01:43,105 --> 02:01:45,733
Really? How are you?

1144
02:01:46,009 --> 02:01:51,914
Allow me to introduce you
to one of my son's friends.

1145
02:01:52,116 --> 02:01:55,381
- What a nice-looking young man!
- Are you a journalist?

1146
02:01:55,586 --> 02:01:58,054
I'm beat. I would need a nanny
to take me to bed.

1147
02:01:58,256 --> 02:02:00,190
Do you want to do it, Jane?

1148
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:04,496
- Will you be my nanny tonight?
- No!

1149
02:02:04,965 --> 02:02:07,661
Lady Rodd, do you ever wash
these dogs? They stink.

1150
02:02:08,036 --> 02:02:11,096
They have a wonderful odor.

1151
02:02:12,073 --> 02:02:15,770
And this is the historic Irene, this year's
debutante. Who I really want to marry...

1152
02:02:16,011 --> 02:02:19,970
- Thanks, I already know who he is.
- Excuse me.

1153
02:02:22,285 --> 02:02:25,982
Come on. I'd like to dance.

1154
02:02:26,823 --> 02:02:29,257
Which of the two was making
advances, you or him?

1155
02:02:29,527 --> 02:02:31,154
Me, of course.

1156
02:02:35,702 --> 02:02:38,637
You really want to see your name
in the papers, huh?

1157
02:02:39,772 --> 02:02:44,903
- Why don't we go somewhere quiet?
- And where would that be?

1158
02:02:49,051 --> 02:02:53,385
My first husband was a journalist.
His news was always exaggerated.

1159
02:02:53,589 --> 02:02:58,117
Poor me, I only realized it
at the end of our honeymoon.

1160
02:03:00,965 --> 02:03:04,298
It's better to have exaggerated news
than no news at all.

1161
02:03:04,503 --> 02:03:07,165
My husband feels the same.

1162
02:03:08,307 --> 02:03:11,606
Often, the public demands
these augmentations.

1163
02:03:11,812 --> 02:03:13,939
Personally, if you allow me...

1164
02:03:14,148 --> 02:03:17,515
...I could give you some news
that isn't so exaggerated.

1165
02:03:22,624 --> 02:03:24,216
I know this perfume.

1166
02:03:24,426 --> 02:03:25,825
Maddalena!

1167
02:03:26,028 --> 02:03:28,588
Where did they find you?

1168
02:03:29,532 --> 02:03:32,763
I'm fine, I'm just drunk.
Did you know Jane?

1169
02:03:32,970 --> 02:03:33,937
No.

1170
02:03:34,138 --> 02:03:38,370
She's an American painter
who lives in Rome.

1171
02:03:38,576 --> 02:03:40,134
- Really?
- Everyone invites her...

1172
02:03:40,345 --> 02:03:45,112
...to hear the dirty things she says.
You'll see, she's very funny.

1173
02:03:46,420 --> 02:03:48,581
Those are the Montalbanos.

1174
02:03:49,357 --> 02:03:52,884
Federica, the wolf.
She likes to milk the young ones.

1175
02:03:53,094 --> 02:03:54,061
The Confalonieris:

1176
02:03:54,262 --> 02:03:57,163
They own half of Calabria and
the nicest flats in Rome.

1177
02:03:58,067 --> 02:04:02,834
Little Eleonora: 80,000 hectares,
two attempted suicides.

1178
02:04:03,073 --> 02:04:05,633
The Sanseverinos:
Magnificent castle in Tuscany.

1179
02:04:05,842 --> 02:04:09,209
And that's Don Giulio and Nico,
his Swedish friend.

1180
02:04:09,412 --> 02:04:12,108
Next year she'll be a princess,
you'll see.

1181
02:04:12,317 --> 02:04:16,811
Don't make that face.
Do you think we're any better?

1182
02:04:17,022 --> 02:04:20,321
At least they do certain things
with elegance.

1183
02:04:26,368 --> 02:04:30,634
- That villa in the park, who lives there?
- Nobody. It's vacant.

1184
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:33,806
It's the nicest, as far as style goes.

1185
02:04:36,279 --> 02:04:39,840
I'm vacant too, you know?

1186
02:04:43,654 --> 02:04:46,054
And what is this gynaeceum?

1187
02:04:46,859 --> 02:04:49,521
Great-grandmothers,
great-great-grandmothers.

1188
02:04:52,032 --> 02:04:56,264
Beautiful women. They all have
the same eyes, did you notice?

1189
02:04:59,707 --> 02:05:02,767
You know, Maddalena,
I thought of you often.

1190
02:05:02,977 --> 02:05:05,946
- I don't understand you.
- Really?

1191
02:05:10,086 --> 02:05:11,451
Neither do I.

1192
02:05:13,957 --> 02:05:15,948
It doesn't matter.

1193
02:05:18,062 --> 02:05:21,725
If you're trying to talk seriously,
I don't want to hear it.

1194
02:05:23,903 --> 02:05:25,632
How is your friend?

1195
02:05:26,907 --> 02:05:30,308
- Are you afraid of serious talks?
- No!

1196
02:05:30,945 --> 02:05:33,743
You don't know how to talk seriously,
do you?

1197
02:05:34,382 --> 02:05:36,316
Where are you taking me?

1198
02:05:37,887 --> 02:05:41,379
Here. This is the room
for serious talks.

1199
02:05:42,293 --> 02:05:45,353
- Have a seat.
- What are we doing?

1200
02:05:46,964 --> 02:05:48,556
Where are you going?

1201
02:06:09,957 --> 02:06:11,322
Marcello?

1202
02:06:12,360 --> 02:06:14,055
Marcello, can you hear me?

1203
02:06:15,130 --> 02:06:18,122
Did you ever feel me so close?

1204
02:06:19,301 --> 02:06:20,768
Where are you?

1205
02:06:21,672 --> 02:06:23,765
- Can you hear me?
- Yes.

1206
02:06:23,975 --> 02:06:25,237
Where are you talking from?

1207
02:06:25,443 --> 02:06:28,503
From a faraway place,
very far away.

1208
02:06:28,714 --> 02:06:32,741
It'd be as if I didn't exist anymore,
if I were not to speak.

1209
02:06:37,158 --> 02:06:41,527
Maddalena. Maddalena!

1210
02:06:48,203 --> 02:06:51,172
Yes, I'm still here. Don't move.

1211
02:06:54,678 --> 02:06:56,509
Would you marry me?

1212
02:06:59,150 --> 02:07:04,247
- And you?
- Yes, I'm in love with you, Marcello.

1213
02:07:05,391 --> 02:07:06,483
Since when?

1214
02:07:08,261 --> 02:07:09,819
Listen.

1215
02:07:10,564 --> 02:07:13,465
- You know what this noise is?
- I don't know.

1216
02:07:14,367 --> 02:07:16,358
And now? Guess.

1217
02:07:19,074 --> 02:07:22,237
- A kiss?
- For you, Marcello.

1218
02:07:22,444 --> 02:07:26,380
So will you marry me?
Or are you afraid to answer?

1219
02:07:28,251 --> 02:07:31,277
Why this question?
Are you a bit drunk?

1220
02:07:31,621 --> 02:07:33,350
Yes, a little.

1221
02:07:34,658 --> 02:07:36,523
I love you, Marcello.

1222
02:07:41,667 --> 02:07:44,864
You know, I'd like to be your wife,
be faithful.

1223
02:07:45,071 --> 02:07:50,441
I'd like everything. I'd like to be your
wife and to have fun like a whore.

1224
02:07:51,012 --> 02:07:55,210
Tonight, I don't know why, I feel like
I love you a lot, like I need you.

1225
02:07:55,684 --> 02:07:58,380
- Is that true?
- Yes, it's true.

1226
02:07:58,788 --> 02:08:02,315
I don't know if you're just playing,
but it doesn't matter.

1227
02:08:02,526 --> 02:08:05,723
I love you.
I only want to be with you.

1228
02:08:05,931 --> 02:08:07,660
You'd hate me after a month.

1229
02:08:08,901 --> 02:08:10,562
Why should I hate you?

1230
02:08:11,671 --> 02:08:14,538
Because one can't have everything.
You can have one thing or the other.

1231
02:08:14,742 --> 02:08:19,076
For me, it's too late to choose. And
I've never wanted to make a choice.

1232
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:24,273
I'm a whore, you know.
It's hopeless, I'll always be a whore.

1233
02:08:24,684 --> 02:08:27,244
- And I don't want to be anything else!
- No, it's not true.

1234
02:08:28,088 --> 02:08:30,955
You're an extraordinary girl, Maddalena.
I know this.

1235
02:08:32,428 --> 02:08:35,363
Your courage, your sincerity...

1236
02:08:35,564 --> 02:08:37,862
Really, I need you.

1237
02:08:39,102 --> 02:08:44,062
Your desperation gives me strength.
You'd be a marvelous companion.

1238
02:08:44,275 --> 02:08:48,575
Because I could tell you everything.
You know everything.

1239
02:08:49,949 --> 02:08:53,749
Maddalena, are you listening?
Answer me.

1240
02:08:54,689 --> 02:08:59,649
Maddalena, enough playing.
Come back. I want to talk to you more.

1241
02:09:19,885 --> 02:09:21,819
We're going on a ghost hunt
at the old villa.

1242
02:09:22,021 --> 02:09:24,216
Is Maddalena with you?

1243
02:09:39,975 --> 02:09:44,435
Giulio, tell everyone to be careful.
You know that the bridge is rotted.

1244
02:09:51,423 --> 02:09:53,186
Once in '22, when I came to Rome...

1245
02:09:53,392 --> 02:09:56,520
...I spent a night in a castle
like this near Genzano.

1246
02:09:56,729 --> 02:10:00,995
You know, once, in my sister-in-law's
castle, we saw a little girl with a candle.

1247
02:10:01,201 --> 02:10:04,261
- Then we found out it wasn't a little girl.
- What do you mean?

1248
02:10:04,471 --> 02:10:08,532
- Nor was it a candle.
- Oh, please! Don't be silly, now.

1249
02:10:29,535 --> 02:10:34,438
- I'm ready to bet that when I'm dead...
- Listen to the silence!

1250
02:10:34,641 --> 02:10:37,667
- Look, there's a light!
- It's the reflection of the candles.

1251
02:10:37,878 --> 02:10:40,506
You have such lack of fantasy.

1252
02:10:40,714 --> 02:10:44,514
Don't you all remember the story that
the farmers tell about the hunchback?

1253
02:10:44,719 --> 02:10:50,248
- Giulio, don't you have electricity here?
- Watch out for the bats, Jane.

1254
02:10:50,460 --> 02:10:53,759
Bats? They're my favorite subjects.

1255
02:10:54,063 --> 02:10:57,294
Nicolina, be careful, the honorable
is going to jump you in there!

1256
02:10:57,501 --> 02:11:00,436
Honey, the door is closed.
There is no key.

1257
02:11:00,638 --> 02:11:03,607
It must be here on the floor.
Give me some light.

1258
02:11:04,643 --> 02:11:06,304
You know, I can't find it.

1259
02:11:08,481 --> 02:11:10,142
- It's not here.
- So?

1260
02:11:10,350 --> 02:11:12,045
- So we'll go back.
- Let's break it down.

1261
02:11:12,253 --> 02:11:15,222
- Here's the key!
- Give it here.

1262
02:11:15,424 --> 02:11:18,120
- Good job, Nicolina.
- Who found it? Nicolina?

1263
02:11:18,861 --> 02:11:21,295
When was the last time
you came here?

1264
02:11:21,498 --> 02:11:22,988
It's been more than two years.

1265
02:11:23,199 --> 02:11:25,963
- What do you use it for?
- I'd make it into a great flat...

1266
02:11:26,170 --> 02:11:29,503
...but Father didn't want to hear it.
- So, what's next for the great journalist?

1267
02:11:29,708 --> 02:11:32,506
A nice third-page article on the stupid
and corrupted aristocracy?

1268
02:11:32,712 --> 02:11:36,648
First of all, I write other things, and then,
you're really not that interesting.

1269
02:11:36,848 --> 02:11:40,113
- Who did Maddalena come with?
- Who's Maddalena?

1270
02:11:40,954 --> 02:11:43,218
Be careful,
this place must be full of rats...

1271
02:11:43,423 --> 02:11:45,220
...cockroaches, snakes and vampires.

1272
02:11:45,425 --> 02:11:48,986
- And now even full of sluts.
- Thanks a lot.

1273
02:11:51,699 --> 02:11:54,566
I'll go first and light the way
for everyone.

1274
02:11:55,604 --> 02:11:59,267
- Giulio, when was this house built?
- Five centuries ago. In 1500.

1275
02:11:59,475 --> 02:12:02,103
- Who built it?
- Pope Giulio II.

1276
02:12:02,312 --> 02:12:04,803
- You had a pope in the family?
- We had two of them!

1277
02:12:05,015 --> 02:12:08,109
- Countess Cristina!
- Irene, if you are scared, come to me.

1278
02:12:08,319 --> 02:12:10,810
Two popes, my love.

1279
02:12:11,156 --> 02:12:15,650
Come, I'll be your guide.
This way. Come, this way.

1280
02:12:15,995 --> 02:12:18,555
Giulio, we're sweeping the floor
with our gowns here.

1281
02:12:18,766 --> 02:12:22,896
- Oh, Irene, I could love you up here.
- You clown!

1282
02:12:26,008 --> 02:12:29,000
Allow me to say that you're
an incredible vision.

1283
02:12:29,212 --> 02:12:31,737
You look like you stepped out
of a painting.

1284
02:12:43,261 --> 02:12:46,059
What a disaster.

1285
02:12:47,266 --> 02:12:50,497
This place is falling apart.

1286
02:12:55,776 --> 02:12:59,837
Giulio, it's such a shame to see
everything's crumbling here.

1287
02:13:00,449 --> 02:13:05,682
But you're never around. You're always
in Rome and you don't take care of it.

1288
02:13:05,989 --> 02:13:11,222
- What should I do, Father?
- This place will be yours someday.

1289
02:13:12,296 --> 02:13:16,232
- Giulio, I'm your ancestor.
- Get lost, you idiot.

1290
02:13:21,474 --> 02:13:25,535
Irene, please, if you see a ghost,
throw yourself into my arms.

1291
02:13:33,187 --> 02:13:37,521
Eugenio, enough! Try to be serious,
otherwise go away!

1292
02:13:37,727 --> 02:13:40,355
- Is your aunt a medium?
- Didn't you know?

1293
02:13:40,563 --> 02:13:44,465
Her husband left her because
he always found some ghost in bed.

1294
02:13:44,669 --> 02:13:46,398
Yes, I remember.

1295
02:13:47,270 --> 02:13:50,899
And yet I've met you someplace before.
You don't forget a face like yours.

1296
02:13:51,109 --> 02:13:54,010
Perhaps, I work. You might've
seen me in some office.

1297
02:13:54,213 --> 02:13:56,340
- You work?
- Yes.

1298
02:13:57,583 --> 02:14:00,017
Who are we trying to summon?

1299
02:14:02,289 --> 02:14:04,689
- You're such a jerk.
- Cristina's making me laugh!

1300
02:14:04,893 --> 02:14:07,088
- It's not true!
- Cristina!

1301
02:14:08,030 --> 02:14:08,997
Who are you?

1302
02:14:11,468 --> 02:14:13,561
Who do you want
to communicate with?

1303
02:14:13,804 --> 02:14:15,931
I feel some energy...

1304
02:14:16,139 --> 02:14:18,903
Countess, keep the contact.
Don't laugh!

1305
02:14:19,109 --> 02:14:20,076
I'm not laughing.

1306
02:14:20,277 --> 02:14:25,180
Do you have a message for one of us?
Give me an answer.

1307
02:14:25,383 --> 02:14:30,650
What is that light down there that's
blinking always in the same place?

1308
02:14:30,856 --> 02:14:34,986
Don't be frightened. It's a tractor.
In the summer, they also work at night.

1309
02:14:38,299 --> 02:14:40,460
- Call Sister Edvige!
- Who is she?

1310
02:14:40,669 --> 02:14:43,194
It's a nun that in the summer,
walks around here...

1311
02:14:43,405 --> 02:14:46,169
...carrying her head on a dish.
- Yeah, right.

1312
02:14:47,043 --> 02:14:51,878
Is it still you?
Why don't you leave me alone?

1313
02:14:52,082 --> 02:14:55,210
- Go away, I beg you!
- Extraordinary.

1314
02:14:55,552 --> 02:14:57,816
Ask if it's the same person
as last time.

1315
02:14:58,022 --> 02:15:02,925
I feel your breath inside my lungs.
Your blood inside my veins!

1316
02:15:06,633 --> 02:15:08,726
She's just drunk. She's drunk.

1317
02:15:14,809 --> 02:15:17,300
- Why is she doing that?
- Easy, easy...

1318
02:15:17,512 --> 02:15:21,209
- Blow out the candles!
- Mommy, I want life.

1319
02:15:21,417 --> 02:15:23,647
Blow them out. Blow them out.

1320
02:15:25,389 --> 02:15:28,654
I want love. I want life.
I want to...

1321
02:15:28,859 --> 02:15:32,886
- Who are you? Tell me who you are.
- I want truth!

1322
02:15:35,935 --> 02:15:37,630
Who do you
want to communicate with?

1323
02:15:37,837 --> 02:15:40,567
- Giulio.
- With Giulio?

1324
02:15:40,908 --> 02:15:43,877
Giulio, there's a message for you.

1325
02:15:44,711 --> 02:15:47,839
That sleaze is in love with you.

1326
02:15:49,018 --> 02:15:51,612
Giulio, you can't escape my love.

1327
02:15:53,089 --> 02:15:57,219
- That's enough, now. Turn on the lights!
- Irene, don't be stupid. We're joking.

1328
02:15:57,426 --> 02:16:00,486
Irene. Irene, come here.

1329
02:16:05,002 --> 02:16:07,493
Who are you, poor soul?

1330
02:16:07,772 --> 02:16:09,603
Why are you crying?

1331
02:16:13,178 --> 02:16:15,043
Why are you crying?

1332
02:16:24,793 --> 02:16:27,489
Wait, I'll make some light.

1333
02:16:47,721 --> 02:16:49,188
No, not here.

1334
02:16:49,389 --> 02:16:55,225
No, love. What are you doing?
Crazy! You're crazy, darling!

1335
02:17:11,147 --> 02:17:14,412
Do you know this is the first time
I've seen the dawn?

1336
02:17:31,040 --> 02:17:33,474
Marcello, have you met my son?

1337
02:17:40,784 --> 02:17:44,447
Shall we go eat some spaghetti?

1338
02:17:50,162 --> 02:17:52,960
He's nothing but a thief.
Eggs at 45 lira each!

1339
02:17:53,166 --> 02:17:56,658
Forget it. From now on,
we'll buy them in Capranica.

1340
02:17:58,539 --> 02:17:59,836
Hello, Mom.

1341
02:18:00,040 --> 02:18:02,031
You're still running around
at this hour?

1342
02:18:02,644 --> 02:18:05,135
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1343
02:18:06,214 --> 02:18:08,011
I'll go with you.

1344
02:18:08,717 --> 02:18:12,813
- Did you sleep well, Mother?
- Do you still feel like a kid or what?

1345
02:18:13,389 --> 02:18:15,721
We were at the old villa.

1346
02:18:15,926 --> 02:18:18,827
Is that crazy Francesca there too?
Tell her to come to mass.

1347
02:18:19,062 --> 02:18:22,498
- Who is she?
- She's the princess mother.

1348
02:18:34,047 --> 02:18:34,069
I

1349
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:39,106
What have I done
to be treated this way?

1350
02:18:39,553 --> 02:18:44,354
Not even a dog gets treated like this.
Who do you think you are?

1351
02:18:46,763 --> 02:18:49,596
If you loved me half as much
as I love you...

1352
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:52,394
...you'd understand some things.
- Yes.

1353
02:18:52,770 --> 02:18:55,364
But you can't. Because
you don't love anyone.

1354
02:18:55,573 --> 02:18:57,598
- Don't scream.
- You can't even fathom...

1355
02:18:57,810 --> 02:19:00,278
...what it means to love someone!
- But you do, right?

1356
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:05,315
You're selfish, that's what you are.
Your heart is locked, empty.

1357
02:19:05,520 --> 02:19:09,217
You only care about women,
you think that's love.

1358
02:19:09,424 --> 02:19:13,622
Yes, I know. You've been saying it
for four hours. I can't take it anymore!

1359
02:19:13,829 --> 02:19:15,990
- I want to go home!
- Not all men are like you.

1360
02:19:16,198 --> 02:19:19,599
Some men are happy to find
someone who loves them...

1361
02:19:19,802 --> 02:19:22,270
...and they don't go looking
for other women!

1362
02:19:22,504 --> 02:19:27,771
It's you. You're the only one like this.
It's a disgrace. A disgrace.

1363
02:19:27,978 --> 02:19:34,144
No, I'm a disgrace.
And my disgrace is having met you!

1364
02:19:34,352 --> 02:19:36,718
I can't stand
having you around anymore!

1365
02:19:36,922 --> 02:19:41,154
Go away!
Go away once and forever!

1366
02:19:47,168 --> 02:19:48,795
Where're you going, stupid?
Come here.

1367
02:19:49,270 --> 02:19:52,933
No. Leave me alone! Let me live!

1368
02:20:01,086 --> 02:20:03,680
Come on, you fool, get in.

1369
02:20:04,056 --> 02:20:05,284
No!

1370
02:20:05,491 --> 02:20:07,288
Look, Emma, I'll...

1371
02:20:14,135 --> 02:20:15,295
Come on, get in.

1372
02:20:16,237 --> 02:20:19,673
What do you want from me?
What are you looking for?

1373
02:20:20,674 --> 02:20:23,370
You're a slime. You're pitiful.

1374
02:20:23,578 --> 02:20:25,910
You'll end up alone like a dog!

1375
02:20:28,450 --> 02:20:30,213
You'll see.

1376
02:20:30,419 --> 02:20:34,287
Who's going to stay with you
if I leave you?

1377
02:20:36,193 --> 02:20:41,688
What are you going to do with your life?
Who could love you like I do?

1378
02:20:41,901 --> 02:20:44,768
I can't spend my life loving you.

1379
02:20:45,538 --> 02:20:51,408
You always say that I'm the crazy one,
that I live in a dream, outside reality.

1380
02:20:52,314 --> 02:20:55,511
But you're the one who's off the road.

1381
02:20:56,051 --> 02:20:59,885
Don't you see that you've already found
the most important thing in life?

1382
02:21:00,089 --> 02:21:03,252
A woman who really loves you,
who'd give her life for you.

1383
02:21:03,459 --> 02:21:05,654
As if you were the only one
in the world.

1384
02:21:07,131 --> 02:21:09,258
You ruin everything.

1385
02:21:09,534 --> 02:21:13,402
You're always cross, always unhappy.

1386
02:21:17,109 --> 02:21:18,701
Marcello...

1387
02:21:20,147 --> 02:21:24,140
...when two people love each other,
nothing else matters.

1388
02:21:24,719 --> 02:21:27,415
What are you afraid of?

1389
02:21:28,189 --> 02:21:33,024
Of you. Of your selfishness, of the
miserable bleakness of your ideals.

1390
02:21:33,229 --> 02:21:36,130
Don't you see that you offer me
the life of a spineless worm?

1391
02:21:36,332 --> 02:21:38,732
You can only talk of cooking and bed.

1392
02:21:38,935 --> 02:21:40,732
A man who accepts to live like this...

1393
02:21:40,937 --> 02:21:44,429
...is a finished man,
he's nothing but a worm!

1394
02:21:45,042 --> 02:21:49,172
I don't believe in your aggressive,
sticky, maternal love!

1395
02:21:49,381 --> 02:21:51,872
I don't want it! I have no use for it!

1396
02:21:52,385 --> 02:21:55,252
This isn't love, it's brutalization!

1397
02:21:55,488 --> 02:21:57,718
When will you understand
that I can't live like this?!

1398
02:21:57,924 --> 02:22:01,121
That I don't want to be with
you anymore?! I want to be alone!

1399
02:22:01,495 --> 02:22:03,793
- Get out of this car!
- No!

1400
02:22:03,998 --> 02:22:06,933
You're a beast, a coward.
I feel sorry for you.

1401
02:22:07,336 --> 02:22:10,271
Yeah, well, and you make me sick.
Get out!

1402
02:22:10,473 --> 02:22:13,442
No, I'm not going.
I'm staying with you!

1403
02:22:13,710 --> 02:22:16,611
No, Emma, you're not staying
with me any longer. Get out.

1404
02:22:16,814 --> 02:22:18,076
No!

1405
02:22:26,126 --> 02:22:27,718
- Get out of the car.
- No!

1406
02:22:27,928 --> 02:22:30,692
Get out of the car!
It's over, don't you get...

1407
02:22:32,732 --> 02:22:36,862
- It's over. Get lost! Go away!
- Scoundrel!

1408
02:22:37,072 --> 02:22:41,008
That's what you are, a scoundrel.
Bastard!

1409
02:22:42,211 --> 02:22:45,112
- Damn you!
- I never want to see you again.

1410
02:22:46,549 --> 02:22:50,952
- Get a truck driver to pick you up, slut!
- Go, go with your whores!

1411
02:23:58,970 --> 02:24:00,301
Hello?

1412
02:24:04,676 --> 02:24:06,109
Where?

1413
02:24:14,888 --> 02:24:17,083
Where are you going?
You can't go through here.

1414
02:24:17,292 --> 02:24:18,782
Go ahead.

1415
02:24:19,628 --> 02:24:22,756
Clear the way!
Let him through!

1416
02:24:26,469 --> 02:24:29,597
- A real monstrosity, Marcello.
- What happened?

1417
02:24:31,975 --> 02:24:32,964
Tiziano!

1418
02:24:33,411 --> 02:24:36,744
He killed his two children,
then he killed himself!

1419
02:24:44,490 --> 02:24:47,152
Marcello, let me in.
Tell them I'm your photographer.

1420
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:49,954
I'll give the pictures
to your paper for cheap.

1421
02:24:50,164 --> 02:24:52,860
Let me go in with you.
Come on, Marcello, let me in.

1422
02:24:53,067 --> 02:24:55,900
- I'm a friend. I must get in.
- Just a moment.

1423
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:01,137
There's a young man who says
he's Mr. Steiner's friend.

1424
02:25:01,345 --> 02:25:02,676
Let him in.

1425
02:25:11,389 --> 02:25:12,981
Come in.

1426
02:25:16,195 --> 02:25:20,131
Distance between the floor
and the bullet hole: 1.5 meters.

1427
02:25:22,134 --> 02:25:26,093
Distance between the left wall
and the bullet hole: 4 meters.

1428
02:25:26,707 --> 02:25:27,901
Did you write it down?

1429
02:25:29,144 --> 02:25:32,978
No, the wife doesn't know anything.
She's not here. She'll be back at 1:00.

1430
02:25:34,584 --> 02:25:37,382
Apparently, before the killings...

1431
02:25:37,587 --> 02:25:41,216
...he called a close friend,
begging her to go and meet his wife.

1432
02:25:41,425 --> 02:25:46,658
Distance between the back wall
and the bullet hole: 5 meters.

1433
02:25:49,167 --> 02:25:51,829
Let's listen to that again.
Rewind.

1434
02:25:57,546 --> 02:26:02,381
You are the true primitive,
as primitive as a Gothic spire,

1435
02:26:02,585 --> 02:26:07,181
You're so tall that you can 't hear
any more voices up there,

1436
02:26:07,390 --> 02:26:12,953
If you could see my real height,
you'll see I'm not much taller than this:

1437
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:18,568
Were you a friend of the Steiner family?

1438
02:26:19,103 --> 02:26:21,037
I was a friend of Steiner's.

1439
02:26:21,473 --> 02:26:25,273
- Since when? Were you a close friend?
- Did you see him lately?

1440
02:26:25,478 --> 02:26:27,173
Can you tell us about it?

1441
02:26:28,448 --> 02:26:32,748
No. I was his friend,
but we didn't see each other often.

1442
02:26:32,954 --> 02:26:34,854
I don't know anything.

1443
02:26:37,192 --> 02:26:38,591
Anything at all.

1444
02:26:39,962 --> 02:26:42,522
- 3. 10 meters.
- 3. 10 meters.

1445
02:26:42,933 --> 02:26:44,230
Foggia!

1446
02:26:50,275 --> 02:26:54,177
Did you notice if there was
something strange in his life?

1447
02:26:54,846 --> 02:26:59,874
- I don't know, financial problems?
- No, I don't think so.

1448
02:27:00,086 --> 02:27:02,714
Had he ever shown suicidal behavior?

1449
02:27:04,523 --> 02:27:05,990
- I don't know.
- Well...

1450
02:27:06,193 --> 02:27:08,821
...please stay available,
we may need you later.

1451
02:27:09,229 --> 02:27:11,254
Mondini, get the gun.

1452
02:27:11,467 --> 02:27:16,564
- A cheerful person, full of love
and attention for the family he adored.

1453
02:27:16,773 --> 02:27:20,140
His was almost a morbid adulation.

1454
02:27:21,177 --> 02:27:21,199
I

1455
02:27:25,350 --> 02:27:29,980
The weapon used, a brand-new
revolver, type Browning.675...

1456
02:27:30,189 --> 02:27:35,559
...was found near his body, which lies
in an armchair next to the fireplace...

1457
02:27:35,763 --> 02:27:38,459
...in a peculiar position.

1458
02:27:46,409 --> 02:27:49,344
I'm done. I'll see him later
at the morgue with the children.

1459
02:27:49,545 --> 02:27:51,638
Fine. Thanks.

1460
02:27:52,014 --> 02:27:54,949
- Can we cover him again, doctor?
- Yes.

1461
02:27:55,887 --> 02:27:56,945
De Angelis.

1462
02:28:04,195 --> 02:28:06,356
Are they done
with the pictures in there?

1463
02:28:06,564 --> 02:28:08,896
Do you want to go
into the children's room?

1464
02:28:09,102 --> 02:28:10,569
This way.

1465
02:28:12,807 --> 02:28:17,540
Doctor, it's 12:15. I must go to
the bus stop and meet his wife.

1466
02:28:17,745 --> 02:28:21,306
I'll take someone from the building,
because I don't know her.

1467
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:24,214
- I'll come.
- Thank you.

1468
02:28:25,322 --> 02:28:26,619
- Let's go right away.
- Yes.

1469
02:28:26,824 --> 02:28:29,486
Polacci, when you're done,
meet me at the bus stop.

1470
02:28:29,694 --> 02:28:32,993
If someone comes here from the station,
call me at the office.

1471
02:29:01,698 --> 02:29:05,429
Guys, some compassion, please.
At least this one time.

1472
02:29:05,769 --> 02:29:10,206
Try to talk to your colleagues,
they're really exaggerating now!

1473
02:29:20,521 --> 02:29:23,046
Maybe he was just afraid.

1474
02:29:24,025 --> 02:29:27,984
You're talking about Steiner?
Had he been threatened?

1475
02:29:28,197 --> 02:29:30,859
No, not in the way you mean.

1476
02:29:32,101 --> 02:29:35,434
Maybe he was afraid of himself...

1477
02:29:35,639 --> 02:29:37,368
...of us all.

1478
02:29:39,043 --> 02:29:41,534
When is she coming?

1479
02:30:06,810 --> 02:30:08,573
That's her.

1480
02:30:09,513 --> 02:30:11,674
- Please come with me.
- Yes.

1481
02:30:20,392 --> 02:30:23,725
What? Did you mistake me
for an actress?

1482
02:30:24,330 --> 02:30:26,764
What are you doing?
What do you want?

1483
02:30:26,966 --> 02:30:29,025
Enough, guys. Get lost!

1484
02:30:29,236 --> 02:30:31,898
- Hi, Marcello. What is it?
- Good morning. I'm Mr. Lucenti.

1485
02:30:32,105 --> 02:30:35,973
- We must speak with you alone.
- Alone? Did something happen?

1486
02:30:36,178 --> 02:30:39,443
No. Be so kind as to follow us, please.
My car is right here.

1487
02:30:39,649 --> 02:30:41,139
- Why?
- There's been a tragedy.

1488
02:30:41,351 --> 02:30:43,945
- What happened?
- Don't be scared, ma'am.

1489
02:30:44,921 --> 02:30:47,651
- The children!
- Follow us, please. Get lost, guys!

1490
02:30:47,859 --> 02:30:50,191
What happened?
Marcello, you have to tell me!

1491
02:30:50,395 --> 02:30:54,627
You'll see them later. They're hurt.
They're just hurt. But I promise you...

1492
02:30:54,834 --> 02:30:57,598
- Enough!
- What do you mean, hurt? Tell me!

1493
02:30:57,804 --> 02:30:59,066
Get out of here!

1494
02:31:43,325 --> 02:31:46,055
Marcello!

1495
02:31:54,439 --> 02:31:57,101
- Stop, will you?
- What do we do about the key?

1496
02:31:58,176 --> 02:32:00,974
You guys didn't want to wait.

1497
02:32:07,320 --> 02:32:10,812
Go in with the car.
Break the gate open, come on!

1498
02:32:11,025 --> 02:32:13,220
Hey, get out of there!

1499
02:32:26,242 --> 02:32:27,869
Go ahead. It's open.

1500
02:32:28,078 --> 02:32:32,640
Oh, look at the colors! How wonderful.
What are you doing? Are you playing?

1501
02:32:35,053 --> 02:32:37,886
Carlo, come and see.
Marcello is going to break the glass!

1502
02:32:38,090 --> 02:32:39,557
One, two, three!

1503
02:32:41,427 --> 02:32:44,919
To Nadia's health and her
newfound freedom!

1504
02:32:45,133 --> 02:32:47,192
To the annulment of her marriage!

1505
02:32:47,402 --> 02:32:50,428
To the annulment of her husband
and of everything else!

1506
02:32:50,639 --> 02:32:52,937
Thanks! Thanks to everyone!

1507
02:32:53,442 --> 02:32:59,642
This marriage experience brings me
back to my old friends filled with desire.

1508
02:32:59,849 --> 02:33:04,616
- Kind of like being a virgin again.
- It's a wonderful sensation.

1509
02:33:04,822 --> 02:33:08,849
You have to be married first
to appreciate it. Right, my love?

1510
02:33:09,061 --> 02:33:11,928
- Be quiet. I'm confessing Lucia.
- I want to hear too.

1511
02:33:13,133 --> 02:33:14,532
Put on "Jingle Bells"!

1512
02:33:14,835 --> 02:33:16,632
Hey, are you two done confessing?

1513
02:33:16,837 --> 02:33:19,362
Today, making love
privately is insulting!

1514
02:33:20,675 --> 02:33:22,165
Here they are!

1515
02:33:24,313 --> 02:33:27,612
Don't make fun of them, because
one of them is the senator's lover.

1516
02:33:29,186 --> 02:33:30,915
Great! Beautiful!

1517
02:33:35,059 --> 02:33:37,027
Who brought these guys?

1518
02:33:38,496 --> 02:33:41,488
These two will be dead
before Christmas.

1519
02:33:45,337 --> 02:33:49,933
Say, weren't you a writer once,
a man of letters, am I right?

1520
02:33:50,142 --> 02:33:52,770
I announce that I left literature
and journalism.

1521
02:33:52,979 --> 02:33:56,710
I'm a publicity agent.
And with great satisfaction.

1522
02:33:58,019 --> 02:34:01,955
It's true that to survive one has to write
anything, but this is pretty bleak.

1523
02:34:02,157 --> 02:34:03,385
Listen, everyone:

1524
02:34:03,659 --> 02:34:07,527
"He has a Greek profile,
but the modernity of his expression...

1525
02:34:07,730 --> 02:34:12,463
...brings him next to the most modern
actor of our time, Paul Newman."

1526
02:34:12,670 --> 02:34:14,695
- Marcello, you're a slime!
- Listen...

1527
02:34:15,474 --> 02:34:19,570
...why don't you tell us what you'd
be capable of doing for an interview.

1528
02:34:19,913 --> 02:34:24,907
- You wish I'd write that for you, huh?
- Oh, how awful. You'd ruin my career.

1529
02:34:25,118 --> 02:34:27,678
Lf, instead of 250,
I gave you 300,000 lira a month...

1530
02:34:27,890 --> 02:34:29,790
...what would you write about me?

1531
02:34:30,159 --> 02:34:34,186
- That you're Marlon Brando.
- And if I gave you 400,000?

1532
02:34:34,563 --> 02:34:37,031
- John Barrymore.
- And a million lira?

1533
02:34:37,966 --> 02:34:39,456
First give me the million.

1534
02:34:43,574 --> 02:34:45,940
You don't know anything!
Go to school!

1535
02:34:48,480 --> 02:34:51,916
What kind of joke is that?
If he's hurt, you'll have to support him.

1536
02:34:52,117 --> 02:34:54,051
I saw you trip him!

1537
02:35:01,128 --> 02:35:04,120
You're a real asshole, though.
You people invited us here.

1538
02:35:04,331 --> 02:35:07,926
Now we're taking our things and
we're leaving. Great party you'll have!

1539
02:35:20,084 --> 02:35:23,451
I've never seen such boring people.

1540
02:35:23,655 --> 02:35:26,749
Our guest of honor is bored,
she needs to have a good time.

1541
02:35:26,960 --> 02:35:29,520
For once, you're right.
Why don't you strip.

1542
02:35:29,729 --> 02:35:32,197
Oh, yeah, your intellectual chest
isn't sexy.

1543
02:35:32,465 --> 02:35:36,401
If you put some Middle Eastern
music on, I can do a great striptease.

1544
02:35:36,737 --> 02:35:39,228
No, give me a break,
we've all seen you naked.

1545
02:35:39,441 --> 02:35:41,170
Come on, let me do it.

1546
02:35:41,443 --> 02:35:45,880
I didn't see you.
But I propose the panther do it.

1547
02:35:46,349 --> 02:35:49,079
Here's Caterina,
who's going to strip for us.

1548
02:35:49,318 --> 02:35:51,878
No, too much technique.
She's a professional.

1549
02:35:52,089 --> 02:35:54,785
- I'll go back to eating my chicken, then.
- No.

1550
02:35:54,993 --> 02:35:58,019
If the guest of honor is bored,
why doesn't she do it?

1551
02:35:58,230 --> 02:36:00,027
With great pleasure.

1552
02:36:00,232 --> 02:36:02,257
Now we're talking!

1553
02:36:02,502 --> 02:36:05,938
Nadia, if you really do it,
I swear I'll stop smoking!

1554
02:36:06,139 --> 02:36:08,607
Put on "Patricia."
I'll turn off the lights.

1555
02:36:08,809 --> 02:36:11,778
- Come on, put on "Patricia."
- Great, "Patricia" it is.

1556
02:36:11,979 --> 02:36:14,539
An inaugural
and commemorative striptease...

1557
02:36:14,750 --> 02:36:18,618
...performed by our Nadia,
to baptize her new life.

1558
02:36:18,820 --> 02:36:21,311
- One always has to set a good example.
- It's idiotic.

1559
02:36:21,523 --> 02:36:24,458
- That's why I'm doing it.
- Nadia, your mink stole!

1560
02:36:45,385 --> 02:36:49,549
That guy will be at your place with
the money ready in no time. Believe me.

1561
02:37:04,509 --> 02:37:06,101
At least, I don't remember.

1562
02:37:08,614 --> 02:37:11,310
What did the lady say?
I didn't understand.

1563
02:37:11,517 --> 02:37:14,350
She asked you if you like me.

1564
02:37:27,269 --> 02:37:31,330
That's mine, Nadia! You owe it to me.
I want that.

1565
02:37:32,876 --> 02:37:36,539
Really, Marcello, you got
a great deal with this car.

1566
02:37:36,748 --> 02:37:39,876
It's a wonderful car, you'll see.
It's a beautiful thing.

1567
02:37:40,085 --> 02:37:41,677
Give me a hand.

1568
02:38:01,777 --> 02:38:05,213
Isn't that enough? Can't you see
you're not entertaining anyone?

1569
02:38:05,415 --> 02:38:08,612
You starting already?
I'm entertaining myself.

1570
02:38:08,819 --> 02:38:12,118
You don't have the guts
to go all the way. You're scared.

1571
02:38:12,323 --> 02:38:16,783
- Might as well stop now.
- Oh, no? You'll see. You'll see!

1572
02:38:33,582 --> 02:38:36,016
Nadia, you shouldn't have
taken off your bra yet.

1573
02:38:36,219 --> 02:38:39,814
The bra, it's the second to last item.
Am I right?

1574
02:38:42,660 --> 02:38:44,855
Good! Congratulations!

1575
02:38:48,668 --> 02:38:53,401
Don't take off the slip. Cover yourself
with the stole and then pull it off.

1576
02:38:57,510 --> 02:38:59,478
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

1577
02:39:08,591 --> 02:39:12,584
- She's not kidding, then.
- Good girl.

1578
02:39:24,443 --> 02:39:28,209
Ruggero!
Ruggero, are you serious?

1579
02:39:28,414 --> 02:39:31,815
You're not a sport.
You don't deserve a woman like this.

1580
02:39:35,090 --> 02:39:37,388
And now, Nadia, take off the stole!

1581
02:39:38,327 --> 02:39:42,354
Come on, Nadia. This is it.
We want to see.

1582
02:39:44,734 --> 02:39:48,135
How did her husband
let her divorce him?

1583
02:39:48,338 --> 02:39:53,537
- She's remarkable, isn't she?
- She's marvelous. She's really hot.

1584
02:39:56,614 --> 02:39:58,548
Oh, God, Riccardo is here!

1585
02:39:59,418 --> 02:40:01,852
Hey, the host is here.

1586
02:40:04,156 --> 02:40:06,317
- Hey, sons of bitches!
- Hi, Riccardo!

1587
02:40:06,526 --> 02:40:08,653
When someone like Nadia
gets rid of a rich husband...

1588
02:40:08,862 --> 02:40:10,193
...this is the least we can do.

1589
02:40:10,431 --> 02:40:14,265
What do I care about her annulment?
I have enough trouble on my own.

1590
02:40:14,803 --> 02:40:17,294
And I don't want photos,
I don't want publicity.

1591
02:40:17,507 --> 02:40:20,874
But on the phone,
you said we could come. Kiss.

1592
02:40:22,613 --> 02:40:26,674
- Who's the idiot that broke the glass?
- Hi, Riccardo.

1593
02:40:26,884 --> 02:40:29,478
Tomorrow morning at 6:00
I'm leaving for Nice.

1594
02:40:29,689 --> 02:40:33,853
So everybody out in half an hour
or I will kick you out.

1595
02:40:36,529 --> 02:40:38,724
- I met her in Spoleto.
- Did you call that person?

1596
02:40:38,932 --> 02:40:42,265
No, I didn't. Guys, I'm serious,
out in half an hour.

1597
02:40:42,469 --> 02:40:46,269
Who cares if you're leaving?
We're not going anywhere.

1598
02:40:46,475 --> 02:40:49,342
We're all friends,
you can go if you want.

1599
02:40:49,546 --> 02:40:53,505
Intellectual man, why don't you
amuse us. I'll raise your salary.

1600
02:40:53,717 --> 02:40:58,654
Nadia was a good sport, but her
striptease didn't warm up the room.

1601
02:40:59,357 --> 02:41:01,825
Come on, come up with something!

1602
02:41:02,794 --> 02:41:06,230
I have 1000, 2000 ideas.

1603
02:41:06,430 --> 02:41:11,663
I could keep you a week without getting
bored, but you have to do what I say.

1604
02:41:11,870 --> 02:41:15,829
- We'll do anything you want.
- First of all, let's close the curtains.

1605
02:41:16,043 --> 02:41:20,343
Let's stay in here.
Let's keep this nice intimacy.

1606
02:41:20,582 --> 02:41:24,518
So I propose that our American
dancer makes love with someone.

1607
02:41:24,719 --> 02:41:26,550
Oh, yes, that's good!

1608
02:41:26,755 --> 02:41:31,249
I bet you never made love. Did you
ever have a man all to yourself?

1609
02:41:31,561 --> 02:41:36,430
Yes? No?
A man who holds you in his arms?

1610
02:41:39,137 --> 02:41:42,698
- What does he want?
- Nothing, he's drunk.

1611
02:41:42,909 --> 02:41:45,844
- Happy about your exploit?
- What time is it?

1612
02:41:46,247 --> 02:41:51,150
After all, it's a duty of hospitality
towards a foreigner, a tourist duty.

1613
02:41:51,352 --> 02:41:53,343
So I'll choose for you.

1614
02:41:53,555 --> 02:41:57,389
It'll be Tito the Brute who'll give you
the delight of the first screwing!

1615
02:41:57,728 --> 02:42:02,688
We didn't do anything. We're lacking
courage. You take care of the music.

1616
02:42:02,900 --> 02:42:04,128
Tito, take your shirt off.

1617
02:42:04,335 --> 02:42:05,996
- Come on!
- You think he's a man?

1618
02:42:06,204 --> 02:42:10,231
I made a good choice. Now, when I turn
off the light, make a woman out of her.

1619
02:42:10,443 --> 02:42:13,037
At the same time, the Tunisian girl
will approach the lawyer...

1620
02:42:13,244 --> 02:42:16,645
...who's been living on his memories...
- Speak for yourself!

1621
02:42:16,848 --> 02:42:18,782
All known means are accepted.

1622
02:42:19,017 --> 02:42:22,578
We're leaving.
Thank you for the beautiful evening.

1623
02:42:22,888 --> 02:42:26,551
No, nobody's getting out of here,
there's plenty of time till dawn.

1624
02:42:26,761 --> 02:42:30,925
You, half-impotent as a man
and as an artist...

1625
02:42:31,165 --> 02:42:33,963
...when I turn off the light,
be brave, make the leap!

1626
02:42:34,169 --> 02:42:36,364
- All right.
- Tonight...

1627
02:42:37,874 --> 02:42:40,604
...you'll couple with Mariuccio.

1628
02:42:40,878 --> 02:42:43,369
Then, Lisa...

1629
02:42:43,582 --> 02:42:48,281
...who paints only to take
her models to bed...

1630
02:42:48,521 --> 02:42:51,081
...you know what I got for you?

1631
02:42:51,290 --> 02:42:55,124
Now you've really bored us.
What are you trying to do?

1632
02:42:55,330 --> 02:42:57,594
Who are you trying to hurt?
I'll kick your ass out of here!

1633
02:42:58,133 --> 02:43:00,033
Who invited you?
Why are you breaking things?

1634
02:43:00,236 --> 02:43:04,502
Riccardino, you'll have a good time
now. This party must never end.

1635
02:43:04,774 --> 02:43:07,208
We'll all stay here.
Someone could come at anytime.

1636
02:43:07,409 --> 02:43:10,901
That's a great line! New, especially.

1637
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:14,975
And you...

1638
02:43:16,287 --> 02:43:19,313
You're dying to make love with me...

1639
02:43:19,524 --> 02:43:22,288
...because you can't find anyone
who'd come under your sheets.

1640
02:43:22,494 --> 02:43:26,954
You release your tension by singing
on those lousy records...

1641
02:43:27,166 --> 02:43:29,100
God, Marcello, I pity you.

1642
02:43:36,777 --> 02:43:40,508
No, not even in Neapolitan dramas!
No!

1643
02:43:40,850 --> 02:43:43,580
You're a real pig. I don't allow
this sort of behavior.

1644
02:43:43,786 --> 02:43:45,913
Apologize to the lady!

1645
02:43:46,456 --> 02:43:48,048
Leave him alone.

1646
02:43:48,492 --> 02:43:52,519
I wanted to give a thank-you speech
to all my friends...

1647
02:43:52,731 --> 02:43:57,168
...for the beautiful career they gave me.
- Don't go. Stay with me!

1648
02:43:58,003 --> 02:44:00,836
I wanted to give a speech to thank...

1649
02:44:01,040 --> 02:44:03,531
Why? Who did you want to thank?

1650
02:44:04,811 --> 02:44:10,443
Beautiful, chubby, mountain farm girl!
I'll bet you're from my parts.

1651
02:44:10,819 --> 02:44:13,447
- Come here.
- Where are you from?

1652
02:44:13,656 --> 02:44:18,923
Let's show this bunch of impotents
how strong you are.

1653
02:44:20,497 --> 02:44:23,091
You came to Rome to try your luck,
didn't you?

1654
02:44:23,300 --> 02:44:27,862
But I'm so unlucky.
If you only knew how unlucky I am.

1655
02:44:29,574 --> 02:44:34,637
What's the matter? What is it?
Are you sick? Wake up!

1656
02:44:39,019 --> 02:44:40,418
Get her some water, she's sick.

1657
02:44:40,587 --> 02:44:40,654
I

1658
02:44:40,654 --> 02:44:44,522
Andrea! Start turning off the lights.

1659
02:44:45,193 --> 02:44:48,253
- What about these guarantees?
- I'm not signing anything.

1660
02:44:48,463 --> 02:44:51,557
- I'm working on a movie.
- And you're already broke.

1661
02:44:51,767 --> 02:44:53,962
- It's not true.
- I said I'm not signing anything.

1662
02:44:54,170 --> 02:44:56,468
The case has been postponed
to the 15th.

1663
02:45:01,679 --> 02:45:03,237
What is this music?

1664
02:45:06,786 --> 02:45:09,653
What are you laughing at?
Who turned off the lights?

1665
02:45:10,457 --> 02:45:12,948
- Will you give me a ride?
- No, I'm not going to Rome.

1666
02:45:13,160 --> 02:45:15,560
You, come on, get dressed. Out!

1667
02:45:22,005 --> 02:45:25,463
Darling, don't worry.
This will help you.

1668
02:45:25,676 --> 02:45:28,577
This medicine will make
your headache go away.

1669
02:45:28,779 --> 02:45:31,942
So, what about your first husband?
I haven't seen him in a while.

1670
02:45:32,150 --> 02:45:36,917
To solve the garage problem, I had to
put the pool at the bottom of the stairs.

1671
02:45:37,122 --> 02:45:42,856
This girl is sick. Take her outside to get
some air. Then, thank God I found...

1672
02:45:43,062 --> 02:45:47,431
- Stand up!
- But I'm sick!

1673
02:45:49,537 --> 02:45:54,531
- Let's pretend you're a nice chicken.
- No, I don't feel like it.

1674
02:45:54,743 --> 02:45:57,234
- I bet you're from Fano.
- No, close to Fano.

1675
02:45:57,446 --> 02:46:00,540
What are you doing to that girl?

1676
02:46:00,750 --> 02:46:03,241
I really don't care.

1677
02:46:03,454 --> 02:46:06,446
You really don't care?

1678
02:46:07,993 --> 02:46:10,518
No, really, I don't care.

1679
02:46:10,729 --> 02:46:14,927
- I don't. If you don't write an article...
- Come here. Come here.

1680
02:46:15,134 --> 02:46:18,467
You sure tell a lot of lies
here in Rome.

1681
02:46:18,673 --> 02:46:23,133
I'm not finished with you.
Come here. Raise your head.

1682
02:46:24,580 --> 02:46:26,411
Raise your head!

1683
02:46:33,556 --> 02:46:37,185
- You fool.
- Do you know Commendatore Angelini?

1684
02:46:37,627 --> 02:46:43,497
What are you doing? Will you write it
in the paper that I wanted to strip?

1685
02:46:44,935 --> 02:46:46,664
- Do you want to dance?
- Yes.

1686
02:46:48,207 --> 02:46:50,038
These are really jokes for men.

1687
02:46:50,243 --> 02:46:52,711
- Let's go say hi to the painter.
- He's not there.

1688
02:46:52,913 --> 02:46:56,246
- He went to Riccione with his wife.
- Let's hitchhike.

1689
02:46:56,450 --> 02:46:58,281
No, I want to be alone.

1690
02:46:58,486 --> 02:47:01,478
- I'm really sad tonight.
- Me too.

1691
02:47:02,491 --> 02:47:04,857
- How do I look?
- You look like a hooker.

1692
02:47:12,335 --> 02:47:15,498
- You were very mean to Odette.
- You knew Odette?

1693
02:47:15,706 --> 02:47:17,503
But I left her the apartment.

1694
02:47:17,709 --> 02:47:21,611
- Who is that poor girl?
- My tummy hurts now.

1695
02:47:23,982 --> 02:47:25,210
It's daytime, people!

1696
02:47:26,953 --> 02:47:30,445
- My watch says 2 a.m.
- It must've stopped.

1697
02:47:30,658 --> 02:47:32,091
What time is it?

1698
02:47:32,294 --> 02:47:36,287
- It's 5:15.
- I have to be in court at 9:00.

1699
02:47:36,933 --> 02:47:40,494
- Can you give me a ride into Rome?
- I'm not going to Rome.

1700
02:47:40,702 --> 02:47:45,139
It was a nice party,
but that's enough.

1701
02:47:46,477 --> 02:47:48,945
Enough, enough, enough.

1702
02:47:51,282 --> 02:47:53,978
Where are my shoes?

1703
02:47:56,655 --> 02:47:59,249
Caterina!

1704
02:48:04,298 --> 02:48:07,995
Sondra and Daniela!

1705
02:48:15,043 --> 02:48:17,170
Paul Newman!

1706
02:48:20,650 --> 02:48:25,553
- Have a nice trip, Riccardo.
- Bye. Sorry, but I really couldn't.

1707
02:48:35,769 --> 02:48:39,535
- And now the beautiful Nadia.
- Shall we go?

1708
02:48:42,844 --> 02:48:46,280
- Bye, I'll call you tomorrow.
- No, I'll call you when I get back.

1709
02:48:46,482 --> 02:48:49,474
- Bye, Nadia. Congratulations.
- Thanks, bye.

1710
02:48:49,685 --> 02:48:52,176
- Good luck to both of you!
- Thank you! Thank you!

1711
02:48:53,924 --> 02:48:56,654
And now it's the lawyer's turn!

1712
02:48:56,861 --> 02:49:01,195
- Grand finale with the lawyer!
- Why don't you do a striptease?

1713
02:49:01,400 --> 02:49:03,595
Well done, Mr. Lawyer.

1714
02:49:42,583 --> 02:49:46,019
- What's down there?
- Where?

1715
02:50:06,610 --> 02:50:08,578
Nature.

1716
02:50:08,779 --> 02:50:12,806
Dawn always makes me emotional.
So emotional.

1717
02:50:13,019 --> 02:50:17,513
I looked so good last night
with makeup. Now I feel all sticky.

1718
02:50:17,824 --> 02:50:22,124
But who cares anymore? It's time
for me to retire anyway. I feel that...

1719
02:50:46,925 --> 02:50:49,792
More retire and more come out.

1720
02:50:52,498 --> 02:50:55,262
If two retire, 10 more appear.

1721
02:50:56,171 --> 02:50:59,868
By 1965, it will be total perversion.

1722
02:51:00,308 --> 02:51:02,674
You'll see how disgusting.

1723
02:51:05,013 --> 02:51:07,846
- Back! Stand back!
- Easy. Easy!

1724
02:51:13,558 --> 02:51:16,527
You'll make a fortune with this fish.
It's worth millions.

1725
02:51:17,062 --> 02:51:19,360
Hey, guys, look! It's a monster!

1726
02:51:30,645 --> 02:51:32,875
Oh, my God.

1727
02:51:36,151 --> 02:51:40,451
- But it's alive.
- It's been dead for three days.

1728
02:51:44,027 --> 02:51:47,588
- Is it male or female?
- What's it looking at?

1729
02:51:55,574 --> 02:51:57,769
Why don't we buy it?
Would you sell it?

1730
02:52:02,983 --> 02:52:06,919
- I wonder where it comes from.
- Maybe it comes from Australia.

1731
02:52:07,121 --> 02:52:10,454
- Why Australia?
- Where's the head, where's the tail?

1732
02:52:11,226 --> 02:52:13,057
Poor thing.

1733
02:52:16,900 --> 02:52:18,959
And it insists on looking.

1734
02:53:04,625 --> 02:53:06,923
I don't understand.
I can't hear you!

1735
02:53:19,708 --> 02:53:21,699
I don't understand,

1736
02:53:28,352 --> 02:53:30,752
I can't hear!

1737
02:53:40,800 --> 02:53:43,064
- Let's go!
- I'm coming.
