1
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:32,594
Watch out, Axel!

2
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:34,930
Gonna be blowing "fireballs"
after tonight.

3
00:04:35,014 --> 00:04:36,181
Fucking-A!

4
00:04:36,432 --> 00:04:37,683
Not bad!

5
00:04:39,185 --> 00:04:43,105
Steve, now you're going to the army,
how about giving me my 20 bucks back?

6
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:54,283
Alright, Mike!
Take care buddy!

7
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,701
See ya fellas!

8
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,875
You know about the happy Roman?
He was "glad-he-ate-her!"

9
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,043
Let's go!

10
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,461
Where's Stan?

11
00:05:06,546 --> 00:05:08,130
Stan, Let's go!

12
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:19,474
Take it easy, don't get your 
ass shot off! Take care!

13
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:23,895
Take care of yourself! Good luck!

14
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,814
Kill a few for me too!

15
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:34,323
Axel, there's Stan!

16
00:05:35,325 --> 00:05:36,992
Stanley, you asshole!

17
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:41,330
It's no use!

18
00:05:41,497 --> 00:05:43,665
Come on, you're beautiful enough!

19
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,168
You're still an ugly bastard!

20
00:05:46,252 --> 00:05:47,669
Good luck in the army, Mike!

21
00:05:53,092 --> 00:05:54,593
Get the hell outta here!

22
00:06:06,856 --> 00:06:10,359
Look at that!
What the hell is that?

23
00:06:10,777 --> 00:06:11,860
Where?

24
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:17,949
Holy shit! You know what that is?
Those are sun dogs.

25
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:19,451
What does it mean?

26
00:06:19,535 --> 00:06:22,537
A blessing on the hunter
sent by the Great Wolf.

27
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,873
What are you talking about?

28
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,541
It's an old Indian thing.

29
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,293
You're full of shit!

30
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:30,796
Would I shit you about 
something like that?

31
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:37,552
You know, there's times nobody 
but a doctor can understand you.

32
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,474
That's an omen. We could have one 
fucking good hunting trip tonight.

33
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:46,061
I don't know where the hell
you come up with the shit!

34
00:06:46,562 --> 00:06:48,397
Wait a minute!

35
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:51,650
You thinking of going
deer hunting tonight?

36
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,485
Not tonight!

37
00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:57,072
I'm getting married tonight and 
you guys are going deer hunting?

38
00:06:57,573 --> 00:07:00,242
First we'll get you legal and 
tuck you in bed with Angela.

39
00:07:01,828 --> 00:07:03,161
You're fucking nuts!

40
00:07:04,747 --> 00:07:05,914
Life is over!

41
00:07:07,333 --> 00:07:09,167
You're getting married, 
we're crazy!

42
00:07:09,335 --> 00:07:10,669
It's all right.

43
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,089
It's all right, we'll 
be right with you.

44
00:07:14,257 --> 00:07:15,507
Am I right?

45
00:07:15,675 --> 00:07:16,675
Right!

46
00:07:17,927 --> 00:07:18,760
Come on!

47
00:07:19,345 --> 00:07:21,930
Come on! I'm buying the 
first round this morning.

48
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:26,601
Steven, any help you need tonight,
feel free to call on me.

49
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,938
Sometimes your humor ain't funny!

50
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:32,107
Willing fingers!

51
00:07:32,191 --> 00:07:33,442
Extra lips!

52
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:36,027
Great!

53
00:07:36,446 --> 00:07:39,531
- You're a regular poet, Axel!
- I couldn't agree with you more.

54
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:56,631
I do!

55
00:08:10,313 --> 00:08:11,813
Oh, my God!

56
00:08:23,493 --> 00:08:25,660
I still do not believe this!

57
00:08:26,162 --> 00:08:28,580
My own boy with a strange girl!

58
00:08:29,165 --> 00:08:32,751
And not so thin,
if you understand my meaning.

59
00:08:33,836 --> 00:08:36,838
The next thing is, 
he goes to Vietnam.

60
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,178
I do not understand, Father.

61
00:08:45,515 --> 00:08:49,100
I understand nothing anymore!
Nothing!

62
00:08:52,355 --> 00:08:53,438
Why?

63
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,861
Can you explain?

64
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,197
Can anyone explain?

65
00:09:30,059 --> 00:09:31,142
Pass on the inside.

66
00:09:31,227 --> 00:09:32,477
You'd never do it!

67
00:09:32,562 --> 00:09:34,145
Shut up! I'm trying 
to concentrate!

68
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,731
- It's your caddy against my truck.
- It ain't your lucky day!

69
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:58,086
Axel, you owe him a window!

70
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,254
Mighty!

71
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,089
Mighty Mike!

72
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,675
Here's your truck back.

73
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,928
I hope I didn't break it, Axel!

74
00:10:08,097 --> 00:10:10,181
That was a million to one 
shot against a sure thing.

75
00:10:10,349 --> 00:10:12,183
There's no such thing.

76
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:13,935
Did you see that?

77
00:10:15,438 --> 00:10:16,354
How you doing?

78
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:20,859
Don't take anybody's money!

79
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:22,944
Don't take my money, take his!

80
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:26,031
What do you want to drink?

81
00:10:26,532 --> 00:10:28,950
A "Kessler" and a "Rolling Rock!"

82
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:33,955
And give my friends down 
here my warm regards.

83
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,634
I got a 100 bucks says that the "Eagles"
never cross the 50 in the next half ...

84
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,136
and the "Steelers" win by 20.

85
00:10:48,554 --> 00:10:51,389
I've got an extra 20 that says the
"Eagles" quarterback wears a dress.

86
00:10:55,645 --> 00:10:57,145
Drinks are on the house!

87
00:11:44,026 --> 00:11:47,195
Joe, maybe we could 
use some more flags.

88
00:11:51,367 --> 00:11:52,367
Is that all right?

89
00:11:53,369 --> 00:11:55,787
Up a bit, I would say.

90
00:11:57,123 --> 00:11:58,707
No, down!

91
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:01,710
Oh, the beautiful cake!

92
00:12:10,803 --> 00:12:12,554
You have a beautiful cake!

93
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,809
I haven't forgotten about you!

94
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:20,395
I have one for you, too.

95
00:12:46,173 --> 00:12:48,924
Go to fucking hell!

96
00:12:51,845 --> 00:12:55,681
I'll give every car in 
the town a flat tire!

97
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,767
Goddammit!

98
00:12:58,769 --> 00:13:00,102
I'll do it!

99
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,109
I fucking mean what I say, girl!

100
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:08,277
Come on!

101
00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:12,114
All around ... Like a sea!

102
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:14,950
Ocean of flat tires!

103
00:13:16,286 --> 00:13:18,204
Fucking bitch!

104
00:13:19,539 --> 00:13:21,707
All bitches!

105
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:25,544
I hate 'em!

106
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,380
Daddy, no! It's me!

107
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,635
Give 'em all flat tires.

108
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:10,089
It is great!

109
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,359
It's my shot, right?

110
00:14:31,778 --> 00:14:32,945
Come on,

111
00:14:34,114 --> 00:14:35,114
wipe off the table!

112
00:14:35,282 --> 00:14:36,198
This is it.

113
00:14:37,534 --> 00:14:38,784
This is really it.

114
00:14:39,619 --> 00:14:40,703
I mean ...

115
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,206
here I go!

116
00:14:51,381 --> 00:14:54,383
There's no sense 
getting too relaxed.

117
00:15:51,191 --> 00:15:52,441
You faggot!

118
00:15:54,444 --> 00:15:55,444
Bum!

119
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:16,465
Jesus Christ!

120
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:18,467
How can you do this
to your own mother,

121
00:16:18,635 --> 00:16:20,803
who prays for you all her life?

122
00:16:23,473 --> 00:16:25,975
How can you be so 
cruel and unfeeling?

123
00:16:26,142 --> 00:16:28,477
You marry this girl, 
you leave her ...

124
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:32,147
with me and you go with 
these bums to the Vietnam.

125
00:16:36,903 --> 00:16:39,321
It's one flight!
It's one flight upstairs!

126
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,408
When I come home ... One flight!

127
00:16:43,827 --> 00:16:45,411
I love Angela.

128
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,248
And she loves me.

129
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:54,920
Wear a scarf today!

130
00:16:56,006 --> 00:16:58,173
You don't wear a 
scarf with a tuxedo.

131
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:02,011
I'm not wearing a 
scarf with a tuxedo.

132
00:17:54,898 --> 00:17:57,566
- You trying to look like a prince?
- What d'ya mean "trying?"

133
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:01,570
You should've done that a long 
time ago, that way it would've set.

134
00:18:01,738 --> 00:18:02,821
I know.

135
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:06,492
- Then why didn't you do it?
- Because I forgot.

136
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:18,087
Steven's getting married in 
a few hours. I don't know why ...

137
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,422
we're talking of hunting 
one last time.

138
00:18:20,924 --> 00:18:24,009
The whole thing is crazy!

139
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,178
I'll tell you one thing.

140
00:18:27,931 --> 00:18:30,516
If I found out my life had to 
end up in the mountains,

141
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:32,518
it'd be all right.

142
00:18:32,852 --> 00:18:34,353
But it has to be in your mind.

143
00:18:35,438 --> 00:18:36,271
What?

144
00:18:38,775 --> 00:18:40,025
One shot?

145
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:44,446
Two is pussy.

146
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,782
I don't think about 
one shot anymore.

147
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,033
You have to think about it.

148
00:18:48,201 --> 00:18:51,370
A deer has to be taken 
with one shot.

149
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:53,455
I tell people that. 
They don't listen.

150
00:18:59,712 --> 00:19:01,213
Do you think about Vietnam?

151
00:19:01,297 --> 00:19:02,297
Yeah.

152
00:19:04,801 --> 00:19:08,554
I don't know, I guess
I'm thinking about the deer,

153
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,139
going to 'Nam ...

154
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:12,307
I like the trees.

155
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:16,895
The way they are in the 
mountains, all different ...

156
00:19:21,651 --> 00:19:22,985
The way the trees are.

157
00:19:26,656 --> 00:19:27,656
Sound like some asshole, right?

158
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:31,910
You're the only guy
that I'd go hunting with.

159
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:36,165
I like a guy with movement and speed.
I ain't gonna hunt with no assholes.

160
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,250
Who's an asshole?

161
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:40,419
Who do you think is an asshole?

162
00:19:40,753 --> 00:19:42,588
They're all a bunch of assholes!

163
00:19:43,756 --> 00:19:47,926
I love 'em, they're great guys,
but without you I hunt alone.

164
00:19:48,011 --> 00:19:49,678
Seriously, I do.

165
00:19:50,096 --> 00:19:51,513
You're a fucking nut!

166
00:19:51,848 --> 00:19:55,184
Know what Mike? You're a 
maniac. A control freak.

167
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:57,519
I just don't like surprises.

168
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,359
- Damn thing won't open!
- Give it a kick!

169
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:06,445
Not like that!

170
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:10,616
See that?

171
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:11,533
Fucking-A!

172
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:20,209
Axel, now I know why you're not 
kicking for the "Steelers."

173
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:24,213
I love Mike's car.

174
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:26,465
Some cars, they just sit.

175
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,302
You never know with a car like this
where it's going to take you.

176
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,722
It makes me feel safe.

177
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:43,732
Axel is humping Mike's 
"Coupe de Ville!"

178
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:49,321
Get out of there!

179
00:20:50,824 --> 00:20:53,243
Get up! What are you doing?

180
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,328
Sit up! Don't ...

181
00:20:56,914 --> 00:20:59,082
Here, put this on, 
you must have it on.

182
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:00,333
Crummy tuxedo!

183
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:04,921
It's been stuck a million 
times. Where did you get it?

184
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:06,673
You're not funny!

185
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,008
- I'm beautiful!
- No you're not!

186
00:21:11,011 --> 00:21:12,095
Thanks, Amy.

187
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,941
Axel, come on!

188
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:26,359
Beautiful!

189
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:35,034
Linda, what's the matter?
I was gonna pick you up!

190
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:38,538
What's the matter?

191
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:39,789
He ...

192
00:21:43,961 --> 00:21:45,795
I wanna ask you something!

193
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:51,217
Wait a minute, goddam it!
What the hell is that on your face?

194
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:55,638
Nicky, you and Michael, you're 
going away in a couple of days.

195
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:58,891
I was just wondering if
I could use this place to stay?

196
00:21:59,727 --> 00:22:00,476
Sure!

197
00:22:00,644 --> 00:22:02,312
I'd want to pay you both.

198
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:05,732
- And I was thinking ...
- What are you talking about?

199
00:22:10,654 --> 00:22:12,322
I would want to pay you.

200
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:17,243
Kochatka, it's me!

201
00:22:17,328 --> 00:22:19,329
How long have you known me for?

202
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,666
What?

203
00:22:24,752 --> 00:22:25,668
I don't know.

204
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:24,537
Have you, Steven, 
a firm intention ...

205
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:28,624
to take unto yourself 
as wife, Angela?

206
00:24:28,959 --> 00:24:29,709
I do.

207
00:24:30,294 --> 00:24:32,879
You have not promised yourself
to any other bride?

208
00:24:33,714 --> 00:24:34,964
I have not.

209
00:24:35,299 --> 00:24:37,884
Have you, Angela, 
the firm intention ...

210
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:42,472
to take unto yourself 
as husband, Steven?

211
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:43,890
I have.

212
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:46,726
You have not promised 
yourself to any other man?

213
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:47,894
I have not.

214
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:54,734
Blessed is the kingdom of 
the Father and of the Son ...

215
00:24:54,818 --> 00:24:57,820
and of the Holy Spirit,
now and ever ...

216
00:24:58,238 --> 00:25:01,407
unto ages and ages.

217
00:31:34,635 --> 00:31:36,553
For a buck, you get a shooter,

218
00:31:36,971 --> 00:31:39,806
and a cigar, and a dance 
with the beautiful bride.

219
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:42,058
Fucking-A!

220
00:33:01,806 --> 00:33:04,140
Quiet, please! Please!

221
00:33:11,482 --> 00:33:16,820
Thank you! I have a very important
announcement to make. The owner ...

222
00:33:19,824 --> 00:33:23,159
The owner of the white Chevy 
Impala, would you please move it,

223
00:33:23,577 --> 00:33:25,161
it's blocking the driveway ...

224
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:50,770
Ladies and Gentlemen, Angela and
Steven would like to welcome you ...

225
00:33:50,855 --> 00:33:55,692
and introduce you to their bridal 
party, especially Michael and Nick,

226
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:01,197
who are going to Vietnam with Steven
to proudly serve their country.

227
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:01,007
You dance with me!

228
00:35:04,428 --> 00:35:06,429
Monday is the day!

229
00:35:06,931 --> 00:35:08,348
Monday!

230
00:35:21,445 --> 00:35:24,447
You nut, you want me to dance?

231
00:35:42,299 --> 00:35:47,804
You know I'd be going with you 
guys if it wasn't for my knee?

232
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:51,701
I'm not the greatest 
dancer in the world.

233
00:36:53,204 --> 00:36:54,871
- You're okay.
- No, I am not.

234
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:56,789
You're very fancy.

235
00:37:00,377 --> 00:37:02,378
Do you want a beer or something?

236
00:37:03,214 --> 00:37:04,380
A beer?

237
00:37:04,465 --> 00:37:06,549
Okay, sure.

238
00:37:06,717 --> 00:37:08,218
What kind do you like?

239
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:09,302
What?

240
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:12,388
I don't know, 
I don't care, any kind.

241
00:37:12,806 --> 00:37:14,557
I'll get you a "Rolling Rock."

242
00:37:15,643 --> 00:37:17,810
It's the best beer around.

243
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:20,396
A "Rolling Rock?"

244
00:37:21,315 --> 00:37:22,315
I'll be right back.

245
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:38,999
Do you wanna come ...?

246
00:37:52,597 --> 00:37:53,764
I'm sorry.

247
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:55,933
It's okay.

248
00:37:56,101 --> 00:38:00,104
Jerry, two "Rolling Rocks"
and give me a "Kessler."

249
00:38:01,439 --> 00:38:03,857
It's okay. It's a wedding.

250
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:07,361
You're supposed to 
let go and have fun.

251
00:38:09,781 --> 00:38:11,532
You like Nick a lot, eh?

252
00:38:50,905 --> 00:38:53,574
Put me down! What are you doing?

253
00:39:08,089 --> 00:39:11,508
Axel, no! Put me down!
What are you doing?

254
00:39:11,593 --> 00:39:12,760
I wanna kiss you!

255
00:39:14,346 --> 00:39:15,179
Stop!

256
00:39:15,347 --> 00:39:17,348
Stop! Or I'll stab you!

257
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:20,184
Do you want to fuck or fight?

258
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:28,108
I'd like to dance with the 
lady, if you don't mind.

259
00:39:37,118 --> 00:39:38,702
Have you known him long?

260
00:40:05,563 --> 00:40:07,564
Know what the son of 
a bitch is doing?

261
00:40:12,404 --> 00:40:13,987
He's got his hand on her ass!

262
00:40:19,077 --> 00:40:21,078
It's only a wedding, Stanley.

263
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:23,330
What do you mean? The guy is ...

264
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:25,582
Look! He did it again!

265
00:40:26,418 --> 00:40:28,836
I'm going to get my 
gun out of my coat.

266
00:40:29,003 --> 00:40:30,087
Go! Get it!

267
00:41:49,501 --> 00:41:51,919
I'll give him a kick up his ass!

268
00:41:53,171 --> 00:41:55,672
- Stan is crazy.
- What's happened?

269
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,341
He's crazy.

270
00:41:58,009 --> 00:41:59,426
A Green Beret!

271
00:42:03,598 --> 00:42:06,099
Jerry, give the man a drink!

272
00:42:08,019 --> 00:42:09,019
Give him a drink.

273
00:42:22,116 --> 00:42:23,700
Don't cause any problems!

274
00:42:23,868 --> 00:42:27,204
I just want to talk to him.
We're going over there!

275
00:42:28,206 --> 00:42:30,374
Sir, Mike Vronsky.

276
00:42:33,294 --> 00:42:36,213
Nick, and this is 
the groom, Steven.

277
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:37,881
I'm the best man.

278
00:42:40,718 --> 00:42:42,052
We're going airborne!

279
00:42:42,136 --> 00:42:45,472
I hope they send us where 
the bullets are flying.

280
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:46,974
Right!

281
00:42:47,892 --> 00:42:48,809
Fuck it!

282
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:52,980
Fuck it? What did he say?

283
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:54,398
Fuck it! That's right!

284
00:42:57,735 --> 00:42:59,319
What's it like over there?

285
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:01,321
Can you tell us anything?

286
00:43:03,157 --> 00:43:04,408
Fuck it!

287
00:43:06,244 --> 00:43:08,078
Okay, fuck it.

288
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,414
Fuck him!

289
00:43:21,759 --> 00:43:22,926
Fuck who?

290
00:43:28,349 --> 00:43:29,099
Who the hell is he?

291
00:43:29,267 --> 00:43:30,601
No idea!

292
00:43:30,768 --> 00:43:32,436
Looks like a fucking hillbilly.

293
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:35,022
Give him another drink, Jerry!

294
00:43:35,857 --> 00:43:37,357
Hey, fuck it!

295
00:45:20,044 --> 00:45:21,378
Will you marry me?

296
00:45:26,718 --> 00:45:27,718
You would?

297
00:45:30,888 --> 00:45:33,056
What I mean is when 
we get back from ...

298
00:45:34,892 --> 00:45:36,393
I mean, when we get back.

299
00:45:37,729 --> 00:45:39,062
I don't know what the hell I mean!

300
00:45:39,397 --> 00:45:42,399
What goes through your mind
comes out of your mouth.

301
00:45:43,401 --> 00:45:45,068
Angela and Steven!

302
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:53,077
If you don't spill a drop, it's good
luck for the rest of your life.

303
00:48:16,805 --> 00:48:20,308
Don't worry about what 
Stan says. Forget that!

304
00:48:20,392 --> 00:48:21,976
He's got a big mouth!

305
00:48:26,398 --> 00:48:29,066
I never really did it with Angela.

306
00:48:33,071 --> 00:48:35,072
Great! That's great!

307
00:48:37,326 --> 00:48:39,327
It's my last one true secret.

308
00:48:39,411 --> 00:48:41,996
That's nothing,
just forget about it.

309
00:48:49,922 --> 00:48:51,589
What am I gonna do
when she has a baby?

310
00:48:51,757 --> 00:48:55,009
Leave it all to 
Angela, hang loose.

311
00:48:56,428 --> 00:48:57,845
Be happy!

312
00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:06,103
See you Monday on the train.

313
00:49:09,608 --> 00:49:10,608
Drive carefully!

314
00:49:11,109 --> 00:49:13,027
You didn't know that 
about Angela, eh?

315
00:49:14,613 --> 00:49:17,031
- It's bullshit!
- Yeah?

316
00:49:19,368 --> 00:49:21,535
- I happen to know it's true.
- You're full of bullshit!

317
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,622
You want a bet? Put your 
money where your mouth is!

318
00:49:25,707 --> 00:49:26,707
Fuck you!

319
00:49:26,875 --> 00:49:28,125
Grow up!

320
00:49:33,131 --> 00:49:34,715
Alright!

321
00:49:48,397 --> 00:49:50,481
Michael, what are you doing?

322
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:57,905
What the hell are you doing?

323
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,744
What are you doing?

324
00:50:09,001 --> 00:50:10,167
Come back here!

325
00:50:12,004 --> 00:50:13,671
What is he doing?

326
00:50:22,014 --> 00:50:23,097
Come back!

327
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:25,182
I've got to talk to ya!

328
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:13,481
Shit!

329
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:18,903
I must be out of my fucking mind!

330
00:51:18,987 --> 00:51:20,738
I must be out of my ...

331
00:51:26,495 --> 00:51:30,081
Everything's going so fast, man!

332
00:51:36,254 --> 00:51:38,089
Think we all will come back?

333
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,257
From 'Nam?

334
00:51:44,513 --> 00:51:45,930
You know something?

335
00:51:46,598 --> 00:51:47,598
The whole thing,

336
00:51:49,434 --> 00:51:50,851
it's right here.

337
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:53,604
I love this fucking place.

338
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:57,608
I know that sounds crazy,
but if anything happens ...

339
00:51:58,026 --> 00:52:00,611
don't leave me over there.

340
00:52:01,613 --> 00:52:04,615
Just don't leave me.
You've got to promise me that.

341
00:52:06,868 --> 00:52:11,539
No, man, you've got to 
promise, definitely.

342
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,377
You've got it!

343
00:52:16,962 --> 00:52:17,962
Promise?

344
00:53:09,264 --> 00:53:10,931
That sounds like shit.

345
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:16,604
It is the "Screaming 
Eagles Airborne" song.

346
00:53:20,525 --> 00:53:22,026
"Screaming Assholes!"

347
00:53:30,285 --> 00:53:32,453
I can't remember the 
rest of the words.

348
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:38,626
Get scared!

349
00:53:53,808 --> 00:53:54,975
Don't push!

350
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,061
It's fucking cold!

351
00:54:00,732 --> 00:54:02,316
36 beers!

352
00:54:03,818 --> 00:54:04,818
What?

353
00:54:06,071 --> 00:54:07,738
Right, I'll go 'round already!

354
00:54:14,413 --> 00:54:18,583
Did you ever piss and take a 
drink of beer at the same time?

355
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,511
I barely got a chance 
to shake it off.

356
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:32,430
Wait! You fuck ...

357
00:54:35,685 --> 00:54:36,851
Bastards!

358
00:54:39,188 --> 00:54:40,605
Sons of bitches!

359
00:55:16,642 --> 00:55:18,310
You guys going my way?

360
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:32,741
That's not funny!

361
00:55:52,261 --> 00:55:54,179
Don't fuck around now!

362
00:55:56,515 --> 00:55:59,184
Come on, don't fuck around!

363
00:56:01,437 --> 00:56:02,854
Don't fuck around!

364
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:32,050
Let me out!

365
00:56:38,808 --> 00:56:40,225
This is not it!

366
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:44,396
Somehow they changed it.

367
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:47,399
Like this happens every year!

368
00:56:47,566 --> 00:56:48,983
You're full of shit, Stanley!

369
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:50,819
Who did you say's full of shit?

370
00:56:50,903 --> 00:56:53,321
You, you're always full of shit!

371
00:56:54,490 --> 00:56:55,490
I'm starving.

372
00:56:55,574 --> 00:56:56,741
Eat that!

373
00:56:57,743 --> 00:57:00,161
How come I never see you eating?

374
00:57:00,246 --> 00:57:02,997
I like to starve, 
keeps the fear up.

375
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:05,583
It ain't natural. Come on, John!

376
00:57:06,836 --> 00:57:07,585
That's mine!

377
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:10,088
- You really want it that bad?
- Right!

378
00:57:10,256 --> 00:57:11,506
Give me a "Twinkie," Mike.

379
00:57:12,091 --> 00:57:14,259
What are you guys, 
a bunch of cripples?

380
00:57:22,351 --> 00:57:24,269
- That's mustard!
- What?

381
00:57:25,938 --> 00:57:28,356
You put mustard on your "Twinkie!"

382
00:57:29,108 --> 00:57:31,776
You're talking like a traffic cop!

383
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,528
Unbelievable!

384
00:57:33,612 --> 00:57:34,863
Give me a beer, Mike!

385
00:57:36,282 --> 00:57:39,284
I can't believe you guys!
What am I doing with you?

386
00:57:39,452 --> 00:57:40,702
This is not it!

387
00:57:41,203 --> 00:57:43,037
They changed it somehow!

388
00:57:44,874 --> 00:57:46,624
You couldn't find your 
own ass with two hands!

389
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:47,792
Fucking-A!

390
00:57:49,211 --> 00:57:52,130
We forgot to toast 
Steven and Angela.

391
00:58:01,307 --> 00:58:02,140
What?

392
00:58:06,645 --> 00:58:10,482
- Don't, I've got things in my mouth!
- I can't take you guys anywhere!

393
00:58:10,983 --> 00:58:11,983
What are you doing?

394
00:58:12,151 --> 00:58:13,485
Get your hands off the bread!

395
00:58:13,986 --> 00:58:16,905
You can dress them up, but 
you can't take them anywhere.

396
00:58:18,324 --> 00:58:21,409
What the fuck are you doing?
That was mine, you assholes!

397
00:58:26,832 --> 00:58:28,500
Fucking assholes! You can't ...

398
00:58:30,669 --> 00:58:32,003
Fucking-A!

399
00:58:32,838 --> 00:58:35,340
You've got a terrific vocabulary!

400
00:58:35,508 --> 00:58:36,841
Fucking-A!

401
00:58:37,009 --> 00:58:38,510
Hey, where's the gear!

402
00:58:39,929 --> 00:58:41,179
Gimme my bag!

403
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:45,350
It's getting cold, eh?

404
00:58:47,186 --> 00:58:50,021
Hey, Mike. You got any 
extra thermal socks?

405
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,031
Got any extra thermal socks?

406
00:59:01,367 --> 00:59:03,368
Come on, I got 'em.

407
00:59:04,787 --> 00:59:06,538
Where the hell's my boots?

408
00:59:09,708 --> 00:59:11,376
Anybody seen my boots?

409
00:59:12,211 --> 00:59:13,878
Somebody took my boots!

410
00:59:14,630 --> 00:59:16,214
I bought 'em special.

411
00:59:17,383 --> 00:59:18,383
Alright!

412
00:59:18,551 --> 00:59:21,302
Alright, guys!
I want my boots back!

413
00:59:21,387 --> 00:59:24,556
I've got a boot, 
right up your ass!

414
00:59:30,563 --> 00:59:32,230
Mike, let me borrow
your extra pair?

415
00:59:33,482 --> 00:59:34,649
No, Stan.

416
00:59:36,068 --> 00:59:37,151
No?

417
00:59:39,905 --> 00:59:42,907
- What do you mean, no?
- Just what I said: No! No means no!

418
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,078
You're some fucking friend.

419
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:49,664
- You know that?
- You've gotta learn, Stanley.

420
00:59:49,748 --> 00:59:53,418
- Here, you've got your head up your ass!
- Maybe he likes the view up there!

421
00:59:58,757 --> 01:00:03,928
Every time he comes up, he's got
no knife, no jacket, and no boots!

422
01:00:04,346 --> 01:00:07,765
All he's got is that stupid gun
he carries around, like John Wayne.

423
01:00:08,183 --> 01:00:09,767
That ain't gonna help you.

424
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:12,270
What the hell? 
Give him the boots!

425
01:00:12,771 --> 01:00:16,274
I ain't giving him 
no boots, no more.

426
01:00:17,359 --> 01:00:19,360
You're a fucking bastard!

427
01:00:20,696 --> 01:00:22,947
See this? This is this!

428
01:00:23,115 --> 01:00:25,617
This ain't something 
else! This is this!

429
01:00:25,951 --> 01:00:27,952
From now on, you're on your own.

430
01:00:32,708 --> 01:00:34,709
I fixed you up a million times.

431
01:00:34,877 --> 01:00:36,794
I fixed him up a million times.

432
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,797
I don't know how many times!

433
01:00:40,132 --> 01:00:42,550
And nothing ever happened.

434
01:00:42,968 --> 01:00:46,054
Your trouble is
nobody knows what 
you're talking about.

435
01:00:46,138 --> 01:00:50,141
"This is this!" What the hell's 
that supposed to mean?

436
01:00:50,476 --> 01:00:52,977
Is that some faggot 
sounding bullshit?

437
01:00:53,145 --> 01:00:56,230
Shut up, will'ya? 
You're outta line!

438
01:00:56,649 --> 01:00:58,149
Watch out with that gun.

439
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:03,237
You know what I think?
I think you're a fucking faggot!

440
01:01:03,739 --> 01:01:04,989
Come on, you guys!

441
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:08,576
Last week he could have had the 
new waitress at the "Bowladrome"

442
01:01:08,744 --> 01:01:10,995
and look what he fucking did?

443
01:01:11,163 --> 01:01:13,331
Nothing! That's what!

444
01:01:13,499 --> 01:01:16,167
Shut up, Stan!

445
01:01:16,835 --> 01:01:22,507
Shut up! Take Michael's goddam boots
and shut up, otherwise I'm going home!

446
01:01:22,675 --> 01:01:24,592
OK, I'm going home right now!

447
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:27,595
Get off my stuff!
What the hell you doing?

448
01:01:30,516 --> 01:01:31,766
Hey, Stosh ...

449
01:01:33,185 --> 01:01:34,435
I said no.

450
01:01:39,942 --> 01:01:42,110
Where you gonna shoot me?

451
01:01:43,612 --> 01:01:44,862
Here!

452
01:02:05,718 --> 01:02:06,884
What's the matter with you?

453
01:05:38,181 --> 01:05:40,849
Bums! Go home!

454
01:10:39,065 --> 01:10:40,899
Un-fucking-believable!

455
01:11:28,615 --> 01:11:30,533
Christ, I don't believe it!

456
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,788
Jesus Christ!

457
01:13:31,154 --> 01:13:32,738
Stevie, take it easy!

458
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:36,659
Stevie, calm down!

459
01:13:45,502 --> 01:13:49,755
Think of something else!
Pull yourself together!

460
01:13:56,847 --> 01:13:58,013
We don't belong here.

461
01:14:17,784 --> 01:14:20,453
Stevie, it's gonna be okay! Okay!

462
01:14:22,205 --> 01:14:24,540
- I'm loose.
- It's gonna be okay.

463
01:14:42,976 --> 01:14:45,311
- I'm okay.
- Okay, take it easy.

464
01:14:48,565 --> 01:14:49,982
It's okay!

465
01:14:51,318 --> 01:14:53,903
Take it easy, Stevie!

466
01:15:07,501 --> 01:15:08,584
Come on!

467
01:15:11,838 --> 01:15:13,088
I'm okay.

468
01:15:40,867 --> 01:15:43,869
Keep calm. Press hard. Okay!

469
01:15:44,287 --> 01:15:45,621
Okay, press hard!

470
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:48,207
I'm here!

471
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:51,210
Go ahead, that's it!

472
01:15:58,885 --> 01:16:01,136
Shake it out!

473
01:16:02,472 --> 01:16:05,224
Think of something else, of home!

474
01:16:05,976 --> 01:16:07,226
Think of home!

475
01:16:08,812 --> 01:16:10,312
Think of Angela.

476
01:16:52,272 --> 01:16:52,938
Come on!

477
01:16:53,106 --> 01:16:55,024
You're gonna have to kill my ass.

478
01:16:58,278 --> 01:17:02,031
You've got to do it! You don't, 
they'll throw you in the pit ...

479
01:17:02,949 --> 01:17:04,450
and you'll die.

480
01:17:06,369 --> 01:17:07,703
You can do it!

481
01:17:07,787 --> 01:17:10,539
You can do it, Stevie! 
You can do it!

482
01:17:16,546 --> 01:17:17,880
Look in my eyes.

483
01:17:17,964 --> 01:17:19,965
Stevie? Stevie, look at me!

484
01:17:21,468 --> 01:17:22,551
Do it!

485
01:17:23,136 --> 01:17:25,971
Alright, show 'em you got balls!

486
01:17:26,222 --> 01:17:28,057
Fuck you, you ...

487
01:17:29,559 --> 01:17:31,310
Go ahead, shoot me!

488
01:17:34,314 --> 01:17:35,314
Come on!

489
01:17:41,571 --> 01:17:43,405
Go ahead! Go ahead, Stevie!

490
01:17:43,490 --> 01:17:45,491
Show 'em you got balls.

491
01:17:45,659 --> 01:17:46,659
Go ahead!

492
01:18:01,007 --> 01:18:02,174
Hey, kid!

493
01:18:02,926 --> 01:18:03,509
Kid!

494
01:18:05,178 --> 01:18:06,845
Look at me, Stevie, you did it!

495
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:14,436
You showed these bastards!

496
01:18:28,118 --> 01:18:29,535
Don't worry, kid!

497
01:18:32,038 --> 01:18:33,038
You did it.

498
01:19:13,664 --> 01:19:14,914
Stevie, don't worry!

499
01:19:17,918 --> 01:19:19,252
Help!

500
01:19:20,254 --> 01:19:21,588
Oh, God!

501
01:19:21,672 --> 01:19:24,007
Michael, there are rats in here!

502
01:19:54,538 --> 01:19:56,039
Motherfucker!

503
01:19:59,627 --> 01:20:00,794
Nicky, listen!

504
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:07,550
It's up to us now.

505
01:20:07,635 --> 01:20:08,968
It's me and you.

506
01:20:09,887 --> 01:20:10,970
What about Steven?

507
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:12,639
Forget him!

508
01:20:13,474 --> 01:20:15,809
- Forget him?
- He ain't gonna make it.

509
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:19,562
Who do you think you are? God?

510
01:20:21,816 --> 01:20:23,650
Look at him. He's in a daze.

511
01:20:25,069 --> 01:20:27,153
He ain't coming to life in a dream!

512
01:20:27,488 --> 01:20:30,073
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying, forget him.

513
01:20:30,491 --> 01:20:33,159
Get it through your head, or 
you and me are both gone too.

514
01:20:42,086 --> 01:20:45,088
- We've gotta play with 
more bullets. │- What?

515
01:20:45,172 --> 01:20:46,089
More bullets.

516
01:20:48,342 --> 01:20:50,844
I've gotta get more 
bullets in the gun.

517
01:20:52,513 --> 01:20:55,014
- What? │- We've gotta 
play with more bullets.

518
01:20:55,182 --> 01:20:58,184
With more bullets in the gun?
How many more bullets?

519
01:21:00,187 --> 01:21:01,187
Three.

520
01:21:10,197 --> 01:21:12,866
So that means we've got 
to play each other.

521
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,618
More bullets against each 
other? What are you crazy?

522
01:21:15,703 --> 01:21:17,453
It's the only way!

523
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:22,959
I'll pick the moment.

524
01:21:23,127 --> 01:21:26,880
When I start shooting you 
go for the nearest gun ...

525
01:21:27,047 --> 01:21:29,132
and zap the fuckers.

526
01:21:29,216 --> 01:21:30,550
I'm not ready for this.

527
01:21:31,385 --> 01:21:34,470
You gotta listen to me! You want 
to stay down here and die?

528
01:21:37,474 --> 01:21:39,893
It's up to you, 
now it's up to you!

529
01:21:40,311 --> 01:21:41,227
No!

530
01:21:41,395 --> 01:21:42,979
Him against me!

531
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,067
Get away!

532
01:21:50,571 --> 01:21:52,488
Me and him! Me against him!

533
01:22:36,367 --> 01:22:37,033
Come on!

534
01:22:38,202 --> 01:22:39,619
These fuckers! Go ahead, Nicky!

535
01:22:41,288 --> 01:22:43,289
It's gonna be all right!

536
01:22:43,374 --> 01:22:45,124
Go ahead, Nicky!

537
01:23:02,059 --> 01:23:04,143
I do three bullets, three!

538
01:23:04,645 --> 01:23:08,815
Three! We do three, ya?
One, two, three! Three!

539
01:23:19,576 --> 01:23:28,167
Three!

540
01:23:28,752 --> 01:23:29,836
Three.

541
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:34,007
Don't worry!

542
01:23:34,758 --> 01:23:37,093
5 minutes we're gonna 
be outta here!

543
01:23:48,772 --> 01:23:53,109
Now we've got ourselves a game. You 
and me. Now we've got a real game!

544
01:24:15,966 --> 01:24:18,801
Ok, you want a game! Alright.

545
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:35,735
Go ahead!

546
01:24:35,819 --> 01:24:38,404
No more. No, no more!

547
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:47,080
I'm gonna will us outta here!
Put an empty chamber in that gun!

548
01:24:47,247 --> 01:24:48,581
Put an empty chamber in that gun!

549
01:24:59,176 --> 01:25:02,095
- Goddam it! │- It's gonna 
be all right! Go ahead!

550
01:25:03,013 --> 01:25:04,263
Shoot, Nicky!

551
01:25:10,521 --> 01:25:11,771
No, Nicky!

552
01:25:13,524 --> 01:25:14,607
You goddam ...

553
01:25:16,193 --> 01:25:19,779
You're gonna die, you 
motherfucker! You're gonna die!

554
01:25:22,533 --> 01:25:24,534
Go ahead, Nicky! Just do it!

555
01:25:25,285 --> 01:25:26,619
Do it!

556
01:25:27,121 --> 01:25:28,454
Go ahead!

557
01:25:34,878 --> 01:25:36,212
You made it!

558
01:25:42,886 --> 01:25:44,720
Alright, we're gonna show 'em.

559
01:25:49,476 --> 01:25:50,560
That's good!

560
01:25:55,816 --> 01:25:56,816
Alright.

561
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:39,692
Come on!

562
01:26:44,448 --> 01:26:45,364
Nicky!

563
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,116
Come on!

564
01:26:58,545 --> 01:26:59,712
Get me up!

565
01:27:26,323 --> 01:27:29,659
Stevie, come on!
We're gonna go for a swim.

566
01:27:37,418 --> 01:27:39,920
We're foreign here in 
the jungle, Michael.

567
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,259
Just get out of here, see!

568
01:27:46,928 --> 01:27:48,845
There's rats in these waters.

569
01:27:51,516 --> 01:27:52,516
Hold on.

570
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:58,248
I wanna go home!

571
01:30:01,896 --> 01:30:02,896
What is that?

572
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:07,067
What's that sound, Michael?

573
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:56,903
I've hit some rocks.

574
01:32:58,155 --> 01:33:00,407
I've hit some rocks, my legs ...

575
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:03,743
My legs!

576
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:12,836
Come on!

577
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:21,928
My legs, I hit some rocks.

578
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,609
My arm!

579
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,864
I can't feel my legs!

580
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:44,701
Alright, come on!

581
01:38:05,213 --> 01:38:07,381
Are you Nikanor Chevotarevich?

582
01:38:10,385 --> 01:38:11,802
Can you understand me, Nikanor?

583
01:38:15,891 --> 01:38:16,974
Yes, that is me.

584
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:19,977
Are you sure?

585
01:38:21,479 --> 01:38:23,981
Chevotarevich, is 
that a Russian name?

586
01:38:27,819 --> 01:38:28,736
No!

587
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,487
It's American.

588
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:32,990
Right, let me see your name tag.

589
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:36,493
Is this yours?

590
01:38:38,413 --> 01:38:39,246
It's his.

591
01:38:39,915 --> 01:38:41,582
What are your parent's names?

592
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:43,167
Lou ...

593
01:38:45,503 --> 01:38:47,254
And my mother's name is ...

594
01:38:50,258 --> 01:38:51,258
Eva.

595
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:55,095
What are your parents' 
dates of birth?

596
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,894
Get him out of here.

597
01:40:18,263 --> 01:40:19,513
Excuse me.

598
01:40:25,937 --> 01:40:27,021
Hello?

599
01:40:29,691 --> 01:40:32,192
I'm calling the United States.

600
01:40:35,530 --> 01:40:38,198
Clairton, Pennsylvania.

601
01:40:40,702 --> 01:40:44,371
Clairton, C-L-A ...

602
01:40:45,790 --> 01:40:48,959
I-R-T-O-N.

603
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:51,045
Pennsylvania, right.

604
01:40:59,888 --> 01:41:00,888
Never mind!

605
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,808
Nothing! No, never mind!

606
01:41:15,487 --> 01:41:16,904
Back off, Jack!

607
01:41:17,906 --> 01:41:18,739
Back off!

608
01:43:14,522 --> 01:43:15,689
How are you?

609
01:43:21,029 --> 01:43:23,780
I'll show you. Come upstairs.

610
01:43:26,201 --> 01:43:28,785
It's not like this with the 
girls back home. It's ok.

611
01:43:29,204 --> 01:43:31,121
I give you a special.

612
01:43:33,458 --> 01:43:35,292
Make you crazy.

613
01:43:38,046 --> 01:43:39,963
No, I don't want that.

614
01:44:02,654 --> 01:44:04,321
Come on inside!

615
01:44:14,416 --> 01:44:16,751
OK, what you like to call me?

616
01:44:18,587 --> 01:44:20,505
What would you like to call me?

617
01:44:23,008 --> 01:44:24,842
Linda, just like home.

618
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:26,177
No! Thanks!

619
01:44:33,769 --> 01:44:35,019
Call me Linda!

620
01:44:35,187 --> 01:44:36,104
Hey, look!

621
01:44:36,438 --> 01:44:37,689
Elephants!

622
01:44:40,025 --> 01:44:41,609
I've got to get the elephants.

623
01:44:43,362 --> 01:44:44,279
No!

624
01:44:44,947 --> 01:44:46,781
I can't stay in a room
with a kid crying!

625
01:44:46,949 --> 01:44:48,533
- Come on!
- No!

626
01:44:49,368 --> 01:44:52,203
Why don't you pay 
me first? Fuck you!

627
01:46:12,785 --> 01:46:14,702
You seem disturbed.

628
01:46:30,386 --> 01:46:31,719
People inside doing it for money?

629
01:46:33,055 --> 01:46:35,306
Sometimes a great deal of money.

630
01:46:36,058 --> 01:46:38,476
I can't play this 
kind of game myself ...

631
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:39,644
but I'm always ...

632
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:41,479
how do you say ...

633
01:46:42,064 --> 01:46:46,734
looking out for those things
quite different, quite rare.

634
01:46:50,406 --> 01:46:51,239
Champagne?

635
01:46:52,491 --> 01:46:53,241
No.

636
01:46:54,743 --> 01:46:56,160
Don't say no.

637
01:46:57,079 --> 01:47:00,498
When a man says no to champagne,
he says no to life.

638
01:47:05,921 --> 01:47:07,505
You saw this before?

639
01:47:11,593 --> 01:47:12,677
Up North.

640
01:47:13,262 --> 01:47:14,595
Oh yes, of course!

641
01:47:15,514 --> 01:47:16,764
Gotta go.

642
01:47:17,266 --> 01:47:19,267
But you must come in!

643
01:47:21,019 --> 01:47:21,769
I insist!

644
01:47:25,858 --> 01:47:29,944
What is there to be afraid of
that is war? War is a joke.

645
01:47:30,446 --> 01:47:32,613
- A silly thing!
- I'm going home, Ace.

646
01:47:33,615 --> 01:47:36,868
Naturellement I pay 
my players. Cash.

647
01:47:37,286 --> 01:47:38,536
American.

648
01:47:39,204 --> 01:47:43,875
However, should you prefer 
German Marks or Swiss Francs,

649
01:47:44,626 --> 01:47:46,210
that, of course, 
could be arranged.

650
01:47:46,295 --> 01:47:47,712
I can arrange everything.

651
01:47:47,796 --> 01:47:49,130
You've got the wrong guy, Ace.

652
01:47:49,298 --> 01:47:51,299
- But you must come in.
- Don't do that!

653
01:47:51,550 --> 01:47:53,134
But I insist!

654
01:50:06,852 --> 01:50:12,607
If you are really brave and lucky,
I can make you very, very rich.

655
01:50:50,312 --> 01:50:52,313
Wow, would you look at that!

656
01:50:54,733 --> 01:50:57,568
- Just keep going!
- You said Logan Street.

657
01:50:57,736 --> 01:51:00,237
- The trailer is right there!
- Just keep going!

658
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:01,989
Wait 'til Michael gets here!

659
01:51:03,742 --> 01:51:05,826
This is it! This is Michael!

660
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:11,916
Stay right there! 
I'll go and get him.

661
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
- Everybody ...
- Stay here!

662
01:51:13,168 --> 01:51:15,503
Three cheers for the 
red white and blue!

663
01:51:30,018 --> 01:51:32,269
- That cab ain't stopping.
- What's going on?

664
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:44,532
What happened? 
I thought it was him.

665
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:46,367
His plane could be late!

666
01:51:46,868 --> 01:51:50,037
Take it easy, Axel, you're 
driving everyone nuts!

667
01:51:53,125 --> 01:51:54,291
You okay?

668
01:52:02,884 --> 01:52:04,635
I know Nick'll be back soon.

669
01:52:05,887 --> 01:52:08,389
I know Nick, he'll 
be coming back, too.

670
01:52:10,225 --> 01:52:12,226
- Right, Axel?
- Fuckin-A!

671
01:52:13,979 --> 01:52:17,148
- Go straight on down to the highway!
- It's your bread, man!

672
01:56:00,706 --> 01:56:02,290
It's open!

673
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:38,910
You look beautiful.

674
01:56:42,331 --> 01:56:43,999
Let me take your coat.

675
01:56:46,168 --> 01:56:48,086
Everybody was here, 
you missed them!

676
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:53,925
They are going to be so mad when 
they find out they missed you.

677
01:56:57,763 --> 01:56:58,930
Welcome home!

678
01:57:06,439 --> 01:57:07,856
I was hoping ...

679
01:57:09,442 --> 01:57:13,194
I was hoping somehow maybe
you had Nick with you.

680
01:57:13,779 --> 01:57:14,779
No.

681
01:57:25,875 --> 01:57:27,542
Did you hear anything on Nick?

682
01:57:34,717 --> 01:57:38,219
Nothing. He is AWOL, 
that's all we know.

683
01:57:42,058 --> 01:57:42,974
He'll be back.

684
01:57:44,727 --> 01:57:47,395
He never wrote to me.
He never called me.

685
01:57:48,230 --> 01:57:49,481
Maybe you were out.

686
01:57:51,650 --> 01:57:53,651
Yeah, maybe.

687
01:57:59,241 --> 01:58:01,159
So, how are you, anyway?

688
01:58:02,078 --> 01:58:04,162
Fine. How are you?

689
01:58:05,498 --> 01:58:09,167
Me? I'm okay, I'm fine. 
I go along.

690
01:58:09,752 --> 01:58:11,753
Still working at the market ...

691
01:58:13,339 --> 01:58:14,839
There's a million things to do.

692
01:58:16,675 --> 01:58:18,760
You sure, you're all right?

693
01:58:19,095 --> 01:58:20,678
What about your wounds?

694
01:58:21,263 --> 01:58:22,514
There is nothing.

695
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:26,101
Just the usual 
complications that's all.

696
01:58:26,268 --> 01:58:27,268
But we heard ...

697
01:58:27,353 --> 01:58:29,437
That's not true, lots 
of guys go through it.

698
01:58:34,693 --> 01:58:36,694
I made Nick that sweater.

699
01:58:44,036 --> 01:58:46,788
I couldn't remember 
the exact size.

700
01:58:47,456 --> 01:58:50,208
I think he is about 
the same size as you.

701
01:58:53,796 --> 01:58:55,797
No, too big.

702
01:58:58,634 --> 01:59:00,718
Well, I could fix 
that though. I mean ...

703
01:59:01,971 --> 01:59:04,556
one thing about wool:
It's really a cinch ...

704
01:59:07,643 --> 01:59:09,144
to fix.

705
01:59:10,729 --> 01:59:12,397
Christ!

706
01:59:15,151 --> 01:59:16,484
It's okay!

707
01:59:23,325 --> 01:59:24,492
It's okay.

708
01:59:26,328 --> 01:59:29,330
- How's your job?
- Great! Fine!

709
01:59:30,916 --> 01:59:34,502
Once or twice we almost had to 
close. I've gotta go to work now.

710
01:59:36,672 --> 01:59:41,092
You've got to go now? Would you 
mind if I walked you to work?

711
01:59:45,347 --> 01:59:46,598
Mikey, you're so ...

712
01:59:48,267 --> 01:59:49,184
weird!

713
01:59:50,352 --> 01:59:52,270
You're always such a gentleman.

714
02:00:01,363 --> 02:00:04,365
It's cold out there.
I'm not used to it.

715
02:00:06,118 --> 02:00:08,703
I'm so glad you're alive.

716
02:00:09,622 --> 02:00:11,289
I'm so happy!

717
02:00:13,876 --> 02:00:15,960
I really don't know what I feel.

718
02:01:09,599 --> 02:01:14,853
Linda, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am about Nick.

719
02:01:17,274 --> 02:01:21,777
I know how much you loved him and
I know it will never be the same.

720
02:01:23,613 --> 02:01:25,614
I just wanted to tell you that.

721
02:01:26,783 --> 02:01:27,783
Maybe ...

722
02:01:28,535 --> 02:01:30,786
Maybe, you don't want 
to talk about it.

723
02:01:46,803 --> 02:01:48,637
How's it going, Hot Lips?

724
02:01:50,974 --> 02:01:52,308
A new kid.

725
02:01:52,976 --> 02:01:54,393
A real tough guy.

726
02:01:56,146 --> 02:01:57,313
It's okay.

727
02:02:02,819 --> 02:02:05,988
Come in with me and say hello.

728
02:02:06,323 --> 02:02:08,324
Please, just say hello.

729
02:02:08,491 --> 02:02:11,660
They want to see how you're 
doing. Just a second, okay?

730
02:02:12,245 --> 02:02:15,664
Hey, look who's here!
It's Michael!

731
02:02:18,168 --> 02:02:22,087
Michael, I read a lot 
about you in the paper.

732
02:02:24,674 --> 02:02:26,759
Doesn't he look terrific, Janie?

733
02:02:26,926 --> 02:02:29,178
Hi, Michael! Beautiful, you look!

734
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:32,348
You look good Michael! Welcome back.

735
02:02:34,517 --> 02:02:37,019
Wait a minute! Look 
at all the medals!

736
02:02:42,025 --> 02:02:44,193
Helen, come on!

737
02:02:46,613 --> 02:02:49,198
We really won over 
there, Mike? We won.

738
02:02:49,532 --> 02:02:51,533
I have to go to work now.

739
02:02:52,535 --> 02:02:54,036
Good to see you.

740
02:02:54,704 --> 02:02:56,038
See you, Michael.

741
02:02:56,456 --> 02:02:58,374
Come see us, Michael.

742
02:03:01,211 --> 02:03:02,378
Can I see you later?

743
02:03:03,880 --> 02:03:06,882
- After work?
- Where? At home?

744
02:03:39,082 --> 02:03:40,833
- One beer at John's.
- What?

745
02:03:41,918 --> 02:03:43,585
I'll buy you a beer.

746
02:03:44,754 --> 02:03:46,088
Alright, just one.

747
02:03:50,927 --> 02:03:52,928
Hey, look at this.

748
02:03:54,264 --> 02:03:56,682
Mikey, how you doing? 
Where was you?

749
02:03:57,100 --> 02:03:59,017
- Where was you?
- Where was I?

750
02:03:59,102 --> 02:04:01,270
We had everything all 
there, the beer,

751
02:04:01,688 --> 02:04:03,188
am I right, Axel?

752
02:04:03,773 --> 02:04:05,274
I got there too late.

753
02:04:10,113 --> 02:04:11,613
You've got a moustache.

754
02:04:13,283 --> 02:04:14,783
Looks pretty good.

755
02:04:16,453 --> 02:04:18,537
- Cute!
- It looks ...

756
02:04:18,955 --> 02:04:20,539
Come on, we're going to John's.

757
02:04:22,625 --> 02:04:24,293
So how you guy's been?

758
02:04:26,796 --> 02:04:28,046
Hanging in there.

759
02:04:28,214 --> 02:04:29,965
How does it feel to be shot?

760
02:04:30,467 --> 02:04:31,717
It don't ...

761
02:04:33,720 --> 02:04:36,305
It don't hurt, if that's 
what you want to know.

762
02:04:37,307 --> 02:04:39,224
How things been? Been okay?

763
02:04:41,895 --> 02:04:44,980
Same old thing. 
Nothing has changed.

764
02:04:45,815 --> 02:04:50,569
I'm getting more ass than a toilet seat
and Axel is getting fatter than ever.

765
02:04:53,490 --> 02:04:55,657
Show him that gun.

766
02:04:55,825 --> 02:04:57,659
Take it easy!

767
02:04:57,827 --> 02:05:00,746
That little pussy 
thing. Look at that!

768
02:05:01,414 --> 02:05:02,498
What's that for?

769
02:05:02,999 --> 02:05:05,083
- The same thing the other one 
was for. │- And what was that for?

770
02:05:05,502 --> 02:05:07,336
- He's a warrior.
- Forget it!

771
02:05:07,587 --> 02:05:08,837
Let's go have a drink!

772
02:05:32,695 --> 02:05:35,030
Come on in the back! Come on!

773
02:05:43,206 --> 02:05:44,623
What's going on?

774
02:05:47,210 --> 02:05:48,961
Stosh, get the glasses 
out of the sink.

775
02:05:49,045 --> 02:05:51,463
- The dirty one's?
- Yeah, use them.

776
02:05:53,883 --> 02:05:55,300
Holy shit!

777
02:05:55,468 --> 02:05:58,136
Did you win the war by yourself?

778
02:05:58,972 --> 02:06:00,889
With no help from you.

779
02:06:01,057 --> 02:06:02,724
Here we go!

780
02:06:07,230 --> 02:06:08,730
To you, Mike!

781
02:06:09,983 --> 02:06:11,149
Fucking-A!

782
02:06:14,737 --> 02:06:17,573
Wait! To Nick and Steve!

783
02:06:18,324 --> 02:06:19,825
To Nick and Steve!

784
02:06:33,256 --> 02:06:34,590
You look great!

785
02:06:39,596 --> 02:06:40,762
How's Angela?

786
02:06:46,853 --> 02:06:48,353
Not so good.

787
02:06:48,771 --> 02:06:51,356
- Worse since she talked to him.
- Talked to who?

788
02:06:53,776 --> 02:06:56,528
Steven? I didn't know he was back.

789
02:06:58,114 --> 02:06:59,698
You didn't know he's back?

790
02:06:59,782 --> 02:07:01,783
I didn't know he's 
back. Is he back?

791
02:07:03,119 --> 02:07:04,369
You ...

792
02:07:04,454 --> 02:07:06,538
Where is he?

793
02:07:06,706 --> 02:07:08,123
Okay, Hey, come on John!

794
02:07:09,626 --> 02:07:10,876
Where is he? Just answer me.

795
02:07:11,044 --> 02:07:12,210
I don't know where.

796
02:07:12,378 --> 02:07:15,130
I don't know where he is.
Angela wouldn't tell us.

797
02:07:16,049 --> 02:07:17,716
Angela wouldn't tell us.

798
02:07:18,885 --> 02:07:20,135
She wouldn't talk to anybody.

799
02:07:20,219 --> 02:07:21,470
Is that true?

800
02:08:04,013 --> 02:08:06,515
I heard Steven was 
alive. Where is he?

801
02:08:13,606 --> 02:08:14,773
Where is Steven?

802
02:08:17,276 --> 02:08:19,194
Just tell me where he is.

803
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:26,034
Angela, where is Steven?

804
02:08:28,871 --> 02:08:30,706
Just tell me where he is.

805
02:08:33,710 --> 02:08:38,380
Where is he?

806
02:08:40,383 --> 02:08:41,717
Please!

807
02:08:42,802 --> 02:08:44,970
You gotta tell me, where is he?

808
02:08:46,305 --> 02:08:47,889
Where is he?

809
02:09:19,173 --> 02:09:20,590
Take care!

810
02:10:12,476 --> 02:10:13,559
I'm in here!

811
02:10:14,478 --> 02:10:15,812
What are you doing?

812
02:10:15,979 --> 02:10:19,148
Nothing. I just got my 
gear, I was going to go.

813
02:10:19,566 --> 02:10:20,316
What?

814
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,401
- I was going to go.
- Don't go!

815
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:26,572
I have all this food.
I'll make you a nice dinner.

816
02:10:26,990 --> 02:10:28,241
I can't.

817
02:10:36,250 --> 02:10:38,084
Why don't we go to bed?

818
02:10:42,506 --> 02:10:45,091
Can't we just comfort each other?

819
02:10:46,510 --> 02:10:49,428
I can't. Not here! 
I've got to get outta here.

820
02:10:50,764 --> 02:10:53,266
I'm sorry. I've just 
got to get out. I ...

821
02:10:53,767 --> 02:10:55,518
I don't know,

822
02:10:55,686 --> 02:10:59,939
I feel a lot of distance. I feel 
far away. I'll see you later.

823
02:11:36,143 --> 02:11:40,980
It feels kinda weird 
going to a motel.

824
02:11:42,482 --> 02:11:45,067
You know what I mean, Michael?

825
02:12:44,711 --> 02:12:47,296
I gotta put my can down for this.

826
02:13:14,324 --> 02:13:15,741
Michael, it's on the house.

827
02:13:15,826 --> 02:13:17,076
No, thanks.

828
02:13:17,494 --> 02:13:18,995
Thanks, buddy!

829
02:13:31,425 --> 02:13:33,009
- How you feeling?
- Fine.

830
02:13:33,093 --> 02:13:34,176
You okay?

831
02:13:35,929 --> 02:13:37,096
You sure?

832
02:13:49,943 --> 02:13:52,945
- What do you think of her?
- I don't know.

833
02:13:53,363 --> 02:13:55,281
Come on, on the level.

834
02:13:55,699 --> 02:13:57,199
I don't know.

835
02:13:58,035 --> 02:14:03,956
Is she beautiful?

836
02:14:08,462 --> 02:14:10,046
- Truth?
- Yeah!

837
02:14:10,130 --> 02:14:11,130
No!

838
02:14:14,301 --> 02:14:15,384
No.

839
02:14:16,470 --> 02:14:18,721
- Do you think she's 
intelligent? │- No.

840
02:14:19,723 --> 02:14:21,140
Neither do I!

841
02:14:29,232 --> 02:14:31,317
I don't think she's 
intelligent either.

842
02:14:31,902 --> 02:14:36,322
- What the hell do you see in her?
- I don't know. That's what I'm asking.

843
02:14:36,490 --> 02:14:38,491
Do you think she's good in bed?

844
02:14:38,909 --> 02:14:40,409
Why don't you ask her?

845
02:15:05,936 --> 02:15:07,436
Where is that fucking ball?

846
02:15:11,525 --> 02:15:12,858
What's he doing?

847
02:15:29,459 --> 02:15:33,129
- What's up?
- The ball ...

848
02:15:33,296 --> 02:15:35,297
Get the jack out of the car!

849
02:15:44,224 --> 02:15:46,308
Watch your elbow!

850
02:15:52,315 --> 02:15:54,233
- Alright?
- Fucking-A!

851
02:15:56,987 --> 02:15:59,071
What you guys want to do now?

852
02:15:59,489 --> 02:16:01,073
We're going hunting, right?

853
02:16:01,408 --> 02:16:02,908
Who asked you?

854
02:16:03,076 --> 02:16:06,662
I'm asking Mike. He's going.

855
02:16:07,164 --> 02:16:08,414
He's going.

856
02:16:08,582 --> 02:16:09,415
But no women.

857
02:16:09,583 --> 02:16:12,668
Just like old times, am I right?

858
02:16:12,752 --> 02:16:15,504
- Just like old times!
- Fucking-A!

859
02:17:48,933 --> 02:17:50,934
You kidding me, Axel?

860
02:17:51,769 --> 02:17:54,271
40 times we could've had it!

861
02:17:56,190 --> 02:17:58,441
If I had been where you are.

862
02:18:08,953 --> 02:18:10,787
Go get him, Axel!

863
02:18:15,376 --> 02:18:16,209
Fuck you!

864
02:18:37,898 --> 02:18:39,649
How sweet it is!

865
02:18:39,900 --> 02:18:41,234
Fucking-A!

866
02:18:41,736 --> 02:18:43,653
Jesus Christ! What was that?

867
02:18:50,578 --> 02:18:53,413
Hey, John! Hey, Axel! I got one!

868
02:18:56,417 --> 02:18:59,169
Hey, fellas, I got mine!

869
02:20:38,769 --> 02:20:41,020
What is that stupid 
gun doing up here?

870
02:20:44,942 --> 02:20:46,443
In case.

871
02:20:46,527 --> 02:20:49,195
In case? In case of what?

872
02:20:49,613 --> 02:20:53,867
In case you stumble on your girlfriend
sucking on a forest ranger's cock?

873
02:20:56,036 --> 02:20:57,620
Say that one more time!

874
02:20:58,372 --> 02:21:01,124
Say it!

875
02:21:01,792 --> 02:21:03,960
You're so full of shit,
you're going to float away.

876
02:21:04,128 --> 02:21:07,297
- Try me? Say it!
- You're gonna float away!

877
02:21:12,052 --> 02:21:14,137
- Take it easy, Mike!
- What was that for?

878
02:21:14,305 --> 02:21:16,806
Did you think it was loaded?
Give me it!

879
02:21:31,322 --> 02:21:34,824
You want to play games?
I'll play you games!

880
02:21:40,331 --> 02:21:42,332
How do you feel now? Huh?

881
02:21:45,169 --> 02:21:46,252
Big shot!

882
02:23:12,756 --> 02:23:14,591
Linda's in back.

883
02:23:14,758 --> 02:23:16,843
- How was the hunting?
- Fine, thanks.

884
02:23:30,274 --> 02:23:31,608
What's the matter?

885
02:23:36,280 --> 02:23:37,614
I don't know.

886
02:23:40,034 --> 02:23:40,950
What's the matter?

887
02:23:42,369 --> 02:23:43,953
Nothing. I don't know.

888
02:23:49,710 --> 02:23:50,877
It's got to be something.

889
02:23:55,215 --> 02:23:56,799
I got the car outside.

890
02:23:57,301 --> 02:23:58,968
Well, that's okay.

891
02:24:01,972 --> 02:24:02,639
Are you sure?

892
02:24:02,890 --> 02:24:05,224
It's okay. Just leave me alone.

893
02:24:07,478 --> 02:24:08,478
Really.

894
02:24:35,255 --> 02:24:37,090
We'll get you home.

895
02:24:41,261 --> 02:24:44,180
I think I'll go with him. Thanks.

896
02:24:54,525 --> 02:24:55,525
You okay?

897
02:24:59,697 --> 02:25:02,031
You ever think life 
would turn out like this?

898
02:25:05,619 --> 02:25:06,536
No.

899
02:27:47,532 --> 02:27:51,118
We have a Bingo!
"Johnny Come Lately!"

900
02:27:51,870 --> 02:27:53,620
Where are you, Johnny?

901
02:27:53,788 --> 02:27:55,205
There you are!

902
02:27:55,623 --> 02:27:58,709
B 15, I 16,

903
02:27:59,127 --> 02:28:02,212
N 33, G 16.

904
02:28:02,297 --> 02:28:04,631
We have a winner!

905
02:28:05,133 --> 02:28:09,636
Get out of my road!
I can't see myself smoking.

906
02:28:10,054 --> 02:28:12,389
The next number is I 16.

907
02:28:13,308 --> 02:28:16,226
I wish I was sweet sixteen.

908
02:28:16,644 --> 02:28:19,730
I 18, then you become a man.

909
02:28:20,064 --> 02:28:22,649
Let's go, men! G 60!

910
02:28:23,067 --> 02:28:27,654
And help those boys who 
can't help themselves.

911
02:28:28,072 --> 02:28:32,409
Will you dance with me? G 47!

912
02:28:32,911 --> 02:28:36,580
I'm still satisfied 
with what I've got.

913
02:28:36,998 --> 02:28:39,082
The wonderful life I've lived.

914
02:28:39,500 --> 02:28:44,087
Think it over, buddy boys,
and I'll give you O 6.

915
02:28:55,600 --> 02:28:59,937
Steven, there's a call for you.
Maybe it's from Angela.

916
02:29:28,883 --> 02:29:31,468
- Hello.
- Stevie, it's me, Mike.

917
02:29:42,814 --> 02:29:44,231
How's things?

918
02:29:44,399 --> 02:29:46,900
I'm okay. Never mind 
me. How about you?

919
02:29:48,319 --> 02:29:49,653
Great.

920
02:29:54,492 --> 02:29:56,326
What's that noise?

921
02:29:57,495 --> 02:29:58,495
What?

922
02:29:59,914 --> 02:30:01,164
Wheelchairs!

923
02:30:01,582 --> 02:30:02,499
What?

924
02:30:07,088 --> 02:30:08,839
When are you getting out?

925
02:30:09,841 --> 02:30:13,010
I'm going to stay here a while.

926
02:30:13,344 --> 02:30:16,179
- What for?
- The place is great!

927
02:30:17,515 --> 02:30:19,182
It's like a resort.

928
02:30:21,185 --> 02:30:24,521
I mean they've got
basketball, bowling ...

929
02:30:24,605 --> 02:30:25,605
What?

930
02:30:27,775 --> 02:30:30,027
Princess Grace came to 
see us the other day.

931
02:30:42,206 --> 02:30:43,790
I've got to go, Mike.

932
02:30:45,877 --> 02:30:47,210
Curfew, man!

933
02:32:05,039 --> 02:32:06,957
Mike? Hey, how are you?

934
02:32:16,634 --> 02:32:18,218
We made it!

935
02:32:19,637 --> 02:32:20,887
That's it!

936
02:32:23,141 --> 02:32:24,474
I don't want to go home!

937
02:32:25,143 --> 02:32:26,726
- I know.
- Good!

938
02:32:27,895 --> 02:32:30,147
Good! Really!

939
02:32:33,484 --> 02:32:34,734
You look good!

940
02:32:36,070 --> 02:32:37,404
You do any hunting?

941
02:32:39,157 --> 02:32:41,241
- Yeah, I did hunting.
- Did you get one?

942
02:32:42,493 --> 02:32:44,327
You didn't get a deer?

943
02:32:45,580 --> 02:32:46,830
No!

944
02:32:47,415 --> 02:32:50,667
I was tracking this beautiful 
buck but it slipped away.

945
02:32:53,921 --> 02:32:56,506
- Angela didn't send you?
- Angela?

946
02:32:56,591 --> 02:32:58,175
- She didn't send you?
- No.

947
02:32:59,177 --> 02:33:02,345
Good. I've got 
something to show you.

948
02:33:02,513 --> 02:33:04,514
- What?
- I've got something here.

949
02:33:05,933 --> 02:33:08,935
Come here. Something 
I gotta show you.

950
02:33:11,856 --> 02:33:14,858
Angela keeps sending me socks.

951
02:33:15,610 --> 02:33:17,861
But it's not socks 
I gotta show you.

952
02:33:18,779 --> 02:33:23,200
This comes every month from 
Saigon. I don't understand.

953
02:33:24,035 --> 02:33:27,037
That place is gonna 
fall any day now.

954
02:33:32,043 --> 02:33:33,376
That's Nicky's.

955
02:33:34,795 --> 02:33:36,379
Nick's alive?

956
02:33:41,552 --> 02:33:42,719
What do you say?

957
02:33:42,803 --> 02:33:44,221
How do you know?

958
02:33:47,808 --> 02:33:50,810
That place is going to 
get caught in a shit storm.

959
02:33:51,479 --> 02:33:54,481
Where's a guy like Nick
get money like this?

960
02:33:55,566 --> 02:33:57,234
Cards maybe.

961
02:33:57,401 --> 02:33:59,986
Listen, Steven, I'm 
going to take you home.

962
02:34:00,404 --> 02:34:04,241
Aw shit! You promised me!

963
02:34:04,408 --> 02:34:06,910
I don't fit! Look!

964
02:34:07,745 --> 02:34:10,414
- I'm going to take you home!
- Shit man, look!

965
02:34:10,499 --> 02:34:14,001
You promised me! I don't fit!

966
02:34:16,171 --> 02:34:19,340
I'm sorry! You do as 
your heart tells you, man.

967
02:34:52,791 --> 02:34:55,793
- Anybody wants one?
- No, Sergeant, we're running late.

968
02:35:01,466 --> 02:35:07,888
Make way!

969
02:37:06,091 --> 02:37:07,758
Where are you going?

970
02:37:08,260 --> 02:37:10,428
Come with me.

971
02:38:18,580 --> 02:38:19,830
Remember me?

972
02:38:21,249 --> 02:38:22,750
Do you remember me?

973
02:38:26,588 --> 02:38:27,838
Do you remember Nick?

974
02:38:31,343 --> 02:38:32,343
Where is he?

975
02:38:32,511 --> 02:38:33,511
I don't know.

976
02:38:33,678 --> 02:38:35,262
Really, I don't know.

977
02:38:35,680 --> 02:38:37,681
He disappeared a long time ago.

978
02:38:40,519 --> 02:38:42,353
- Hold on a minute.
- What are you looking for?

979
02:38:42,521 --> 02:38:44,104
Nothing to see here!

980
02:38:44,439 --> 02:38:45,439
See that?

981
02:38:45,690 --> 02:38:47,024
- What do you want?
- I want a game.

982
02:38:48,860 --> 02:38:49,944
That's for you.

983
02:38:52,697 --> 02:38:57,701
It is too dangerous now.
These times are too dangerous ...

984
02:38:59,538 --> 02:39:01,372
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

985
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:06,627
I want to play the American.

986
02:39:07,128 --> 02:39:09,630
I'll match him. Highest stakes!

987
02:39:22,394 --> 02:39:24,144
How do I know, you 
know where he is?

988
02:39:25,063 --> 02:39:27,064
Because I know, that's all.

989
02:39:27,566 --> 02:39:29,650
But I have to take 
you by the river.

990
02:39:43,331 --> 02:39:46,500
Only because I feel
comfortable with a white suit.

991
02:40:48,146 --> 02:40:51,482
Here we are! If you'd 
like to change your mind ...

992
02:41:27,435 --> 02:41:28,519
Wait here!

993
02:41:52,961 --> 02:41:54,795
He say we have to 
pay for go inside.

994
02:41:54,963 --> 02:41:56,547
- How much?
- 1,000 dollars.

995
02:41:57,716 --> 02:41:59,383
Tell him I'm coming up.

996
02:42:33,919 --> 02:42:38,673
The American is inside. You have to give
him 500 dollars for this information.

997
02:44:21,610 --> 02:44:23,194
- Where is Nick?
- I don't know.

998
02:44:23,362 --> 02:44:26,114
- Where is he?
- I have to ask the boss.

999
02:44:40,713 --> 02:44:41,963
Are you all right?

1000
02:44:42,298 --> 02:44:43,381
Nick, it's me!

1001
02:44:48,220 --> 02:44:49,637
What are you doing?

1002
02:44:52,808 --> 02:44:54,976
Nicolas, what's the matter?

1003
02:44:55,978 --> 02:44:57,145
Get away!

1004
02:45:00,983 --> 02:45:02,233
Do you know it's me? Mike.

1005
02:45:02,735 --> 02:45:03,902
Tell me: It's Mike.

1006
02:45:04,236 --> 02:45:05,653
- Tell me, it's Mike.
- It's Mike.

1007
02:45:07,489 --> 02:45:08,573
Mike who?

1008
02:45:10,159 --> 02:45:13,077
- Mike who?
- Mike who? I don't know.

1009
02:45:19,168 --> 02:45:21,753
I came 12,000 miles to get you.

1010
02:45:22,755 --> 02:45:26,007
Don't do that to me!
Fucking don't do it!

1011
02:45:26,425 --> 02:45:29,844
What's the matter with you?
Don't you recognize me?

1012
02:45:30,012 --> 02:45:31,763
Don't you recognize me?

1013
02:45:36,185 --> 02:45:39,103
Nicky, I love you. You're my 
friend. What are you doing?

1014
02:45:50,783 --> 02:45:53,952
Don't do this to me, you fucking ...

1015
02:45:57,206 --> 02:46:00,792
Did you hear what I said?
Let me in the fucking game!

1016
02:46:20,646 --> 02:46:21,896
How much?

1017
02:46:22,314 --> 02:46:24,649
How much? Here's how much!

1018
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:32,907
Here, you can count it!

1019
02:46:43,919 --> 02:46:46,754
Why not?

1020
02:46:49,341 --> 02:46:52,427
- I don't want the money.
- You don't want it? Take it!

1021
02:46:52,845 --> 02:46:54,178
Tell him!

1022
02:47:46,732 --> 02:47:49,567
We don't have much time.

1023
02:48:17,262 --> 02:48:18,262
Don't do it!

1024
02:48:57,469 --> 02:49:02,056
This what you want?

1025
02:49:12,401 --> 02:49:13,901
I love you.

1026
02:49:49,771 --> 02:49:51,522
Come on Nicky. Come home!

1027
02:49:52,357 --> 02:49:54,692
Just come home. Home!

1028
02:49:57,279 --> 02:50:00,948
Talk to me.

1029
02:50:10,125 --> 02:50:12,043
Wait! What did you do to your arms?

1030
02:50:14,379 --> 02:50:16,964
Remember all the different trees?

1031
02:50:17,466 --> 02:50:18,799
Remember that?

1032
02:50:20,719 --> 02:50:23,054
The mountains ... 
Remember all that?

1033
02:50:24,223 --> 02:50:26,641
- One shot?
- One shot!

1034
02:50:47,079 --> 02:50:49,413
Nicky, Nicky, don't!

1035
02:50:50,500 --> 02:50:51,667
No!

1036
02:51:06,766 --> 02:51:11,436
This seems to be the last chapter
in the history of America in Vietnam.

1037
02:51:11,688 --> 02:51:16,608
It's also been the largest movement
of people in the history of America.

1038
02:51:17,443 --> 02:51:21,947
Hillary Brown, "ABC News" on board
the aircraft-carrier "USS Hancock" ...

1039
02:51:22,365 --> 02:51:23,949
in the South China sea.

1040
02:53:56,018 --> 02:53:58,603
I'll get these tables.

1041
02:54:06,195 --> 02:54:09,281
Axel, bring those 
2 tables over here.

1042
02:54:10,450 --> 02:54:13,702
Everybody make yourselves at home,
the coffee is already made.

1043
02:55:06,839 --> 02:55:09,508
- Cups! I'll get them.
- I'll help you with that.

1044
02:55:10,009 --> 02:55:11,092
I'll help, too.

1045
02:55:32,865 --> 02:55:34,533
There's too many cups.

1046
02:55:34,867 --> 02:55:38,537
- How does everybody want their eggs?
- How about just scrambled?

1047
02:55:40,873 --> 02:55:41,873
Toast!

1048
02:56:14,323 --> 02:56:15,574
Careful, that's hot!

1049
02:56:18,077 --> 02:56:20,745
Hey, Axel, how about some beer?

1050
02:56:26,335 --> 02:56:28,086
I'll get started on the eggs.

1051
02:56:28,254 --> 02:56:30,922
- I'll help you.
- No, sit down!

1052
02:56:32,008 --> 02:56:33,258
Pour the coffee!

1053
02:57:06,626 --> 02:57:08,543
It's been such a gray day.

1054
02:59:31,354 --> 02:59:32,605
To Nick!
