1
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:19,962
This is KKNG Stereo 92, KKNG,
Oklahoma City.

2
00:00:23,769 --> 00:00:29,137
The magnificent American Ballet Company
is at the Civic Center Music Hall.

3
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,984
Great dancing stars are performing
full-length Tchaikovsky ballets,

4
00:00:33,049 --> 00:00:37,686
plus many classic and contemporary
favorites from ABC's vast repertoire.

5
00:00:37,753 --> 00:00:43,536
Tickets are available
at the Music Hall box office and all agencies.

6
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,952
KKNG. And now we continue
with music from the ballet.

7
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,709
Is everybody ready?

8
00:00:55,929 --> 00:00:57,522
Gorgeous.

9
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:13,199
Very smart!

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,550
- I thought you were gonna set up the bar.
- There'll be time after we get back.

11
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:23,446
Dad.

12
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,720
The wife's always the last to know.

13
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:31,127
Emilia, will you get dressed?

14
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:34,007
Janina, that's enough.
There'll be time when we get back.

15
00:01:34,072 --> 00:01:38,065
And it takes you an hour to get ready.
Will you go and do it? Where's Ethan?

16
00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:42,577
Mom, those beads look
absolutely gross with that dress.

17
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:45,681
These beads were given to me by Emma
before you were born.

18
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,272
Well, they look gross now.

19
00:01:48,503 --> 00:01:52,529
- Ethan? Ethan, will you quit that?
- It's the lights. I'm crazy.

20
00:01:52,632 --> 00:01:56,788
Well, the lights are for the party.
Come on, we're leaving in two minutes.

21
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:00,078
Come on, let's go.

22
00:02:00,152 --> 00:02:02,541
- Who's got the tickets?
- I don't have them.

23
00:02:02,615 --> 00:02:05,136
- I got 'em.
- You have the tickets.

24
00:02:07,928 --> 00:02:09,837
I am so nervous.

25
00:02:09,912 --> 00:02:12,465
Momma, don't be so nervous.

26
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:13,036
- How are you doin'?
- OK.

27
00:05:16,564 --> 00:05:19,182
- Did you have a good cry?
- A beaut.

28
00:05:19,412 --> 00:05:22,510
- What'd you tell the kids?
- Nothing. They know you.

29
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,006
They've heard the tale of you and Emma
rehearsing for the same part a hundred times.

30
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:32,688
- There's no law says we gotta go backstage.
- Yes, there is.

31
00:05:32,756 --> 00:05:34,828
Come to the party. Relax, Sevilla.

32
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:40,464
What's the point of doing a perfect arabesque
for audiences who don't know the difference?

33
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:43,695
I was terrible tonight.
I'm going home to soak in a hot bath.

34
00:05:43,763 --> 00:05:46,546
You are no fun, Sevilla. I'll put you in a taxi.

35
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,612
No, thanks, love. My limo's waiting.

36
00:05:51,828 --> 00:05:55,024
- Where are the showers?
- Over that way, I think.

37
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,092
Deedee?

38
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,951
- Freddie.
- Baby, how are you?

39
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,604
Freddie. Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

40
00:06:06,675 --> 00:06:10,418
Meet our kids.
This is Emilia, Janina and Ethan.

41
00:06:14,514 --> 00:06:16,903
You look just great.

42
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,124
Deedee.

43
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:39,664
...instead of four.
- Yes. And he loops that part, so...

44
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:41,737
Hello, Adelaide.

45
00:06:44,627 --> 00:06:46,536
Well.

46
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,676
You've held up very well, dearie.

47
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:53,739
- So've you.
- Running this company keeps me trim.

48
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,800
You could lose a few pounds, Deedee.

49
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,005
So you always said.

50
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:10,411
- No cakes or candy tonight at the party.
- Not a cookie, cookie.

51
00:07:12,562 --> 00:07:14,569
Deedee?

52
00:07:16,498 --> 00:07:18,473
It's Michael.

53
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:20,040
Michael Cooke.

54
00:07:22,162 --> 00:07:25,642
Wayne? Wayne, Michael's here.

55
00:07:25,713 --> 00:07:27,721
Michael...

56
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:34,760
- Hi, Wayne.
- Look at you.

57
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:38,990
- Damn, you look impressive, sir.
- So impressive Deedee didn't recognize me.

58
00:07:39,057 --> 00:07:42,123
You weren't the world's greatest
choreographer when we left.

59
00:07:42,193 --> 00:07:46,448
<i>- Wasn't I? I thought I was.
- He'd done Anna Karenina.</i>

60
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,796
Hey, come on.

61
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,430
- From bar four on?
- Yes. But then I think it's gotta build.

62
00:08:03,505 --> 00:08:05,774
- Towards the end.
- Tonight it was slow.

63
00:08:05,841 --> 00:08:07,848
We should speed it up.

64
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,602
That's how it should go. It shouldn't be any
slower than that. I feel like I'm on point for...

65
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:25,706
Here you are. Oh, God.

66
00:08:25,777 --> 00:08:28,166
- You were wonderful.
- Oh, I wasn't wonderful.

67
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:30,605
- I wanted to be, but I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

68
00:08:30,673 --> 00:08:33,607
- I loved your flowers. Thanks so much.
- You were fabulous.

69
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,495
No, I wasn't.
You know my foot was acting up. I wrote you.

70
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,113
You couldn't notice it. I couldn't tell at all.

71
00:08:39,184 --> 00:08:43,210
- I was so nervous because you were here.
- You were wonderful.

72
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:45,676
- I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

73
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,631
You really were, Emma.

74
00:08:47,696 --> 00:08:49,606
Oh, Wayne.

75
00:08:49,808 --> 00:08:51,750
Oh, Wayne.

76
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:54,574
You moved me like you always did.

77
00:08:55,504 --> 00:08:57,031
Thanks.

78
00:08:57,104 --> 00:09:01,512
- Oh, Wayne, it's been too long.
- Yeah, it sure has.

79
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:06,570
Well... how would you like to see
your godchild? Emilia, come over here.

80
00:09:12,175 --> 00:09:14,444
Oh, my God.

81
00:09:15,536 --> 00:09:18,602
- Isn't she somethin'?
- Oh, my God.

82
00:09:18,672 --> 00:09:22,185
Last time I saw you, I could pick you up.

83
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:25,732
Oh, she's lovely.
She's lovely, Deedee.

84
00:09:25,807 --> 00:09:28,174
She is.

85
00:09:29,615 --> 00:09:30,597
Janina.

86
00:09:30,671 --> 00:09:32,493
- Janina, yes.
- Hi.

87
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,672
- And...
- Ethan.

88
00:09:33,743 --> 00:09:35,630
Ethan. Hi.

89
00:09:35,695 --> 00:09:38,030
OK.

90
00:09:38,128 --> 00:09:40,102
He's a little dangerous.

91
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:46,501
Look at you.

92
00:09:50,863 --> 00:09:53,863
They don't know how fast time goes, do they?

93
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,862
No. They don't.

94
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:59,724
Oh, Deedee.

95
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,995
Oh, Deedee...

96
00:10:06,863 --> 00:10:09,732
Still disgustingly neat.

97
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:12,906
I was always such a total slob, wasn't I?

98
00:10:12,975 --> 00:10:16,236
I only minded when you borrowed
my eyeliner and didn't return it.

99
00:10:16,494 --> 00:10:18,469
To its proper place.

100
00:10:19,855 --> 00:10:23,913
Oh, Emma. You don't travel
with this picture everywhere you go?

101
00:10:23,982 --> 00:10:27,779
That and Mother. The rest appear
and disappear into a scrapbook.

102
00:10:27,854 --> 00:10:31,498
- Oh, sweetheart.
- Did you really wear this hat to my wedding?

103
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:33,835
I love that hat.

104
00:10:36,046 --> 00:10:38,763
God, can you believe how young we looked?

105
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,532
- I look like shit.
- Well, we all did next to Wayne.

106
00:10:43,598 --> 00:10:47,210
- God, he's beautiful.
- Even in those pleated pants.

107
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,060
No wonder the whole company wanted him.

108
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,647
It's a good thing you had your eye elsewhere.

109
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,940
- You mean on Michael.
- No, I mean on the ball.

110
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:04,230
Tell me something, Emma.

111
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,640
What's it like to be you now?

112
00:11:13,069 --> 00:11:15,141
I dance.

113
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:20,199
I take class, I rehearse, I perform.
I go home to my hotel.

114
00:11:20,461 --> 00:11:24,138
Some cities are better than others.
So are some nights.

115
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:31,554
I thought I was good tonight.
I wanted to be, for you.

116
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,728
You couldn't help being good.

117
00:11:34,797 --> 00:11:37,447
- Still?
- Yes.

118
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:40,515
You're an artist.

119
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,730
- Now what are you doing?
- I hate this picture.

120
00:11:50,797 --> 00:11:53,033
I'll send you a new one.
How many bedrooms?

121
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:56,548
You've seen them all.
Wanna see the cellar? We don't have one.

122
00:11:56,621 --> 00:12:00,069
I bet Momma would have been
a much better Anna Karenina. Emma stinks.

123
00:12:00,141 --> 00:12:02,050
You're so stupid.

124
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:05,670
Mark, you know what this
fantastic little Russian's gonna do?

125
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:09,067
He's going to make it respectable
for American boys to be dancers.

126
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:12,842
See, on a good day I can do
entrechat sixes with double cabrioles.

127
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:16,583
- You beat me to it.
- Nice of her to have brought it.

128
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:19,618
- It's all she drinks now.
- You haven't talked to her yet.

129
00:12:19,692 --> 00:12:23,107
I've been busy with the rest of the company.
Wayne, I love the company.

130
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,679
I don't want 'em to ever leave.
I wanna go with 'em. I miss 'em. I want...

131
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,449
Oh, what the hell. Your eyes.

132
00:12:32,524 --> 00:12:34,499
Your ass.

133
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:37,221
Emma? Anybody seen Emma?

134
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:41,707
With all that experience
you're really a professional.

135
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:48,135
Would you like to take class
with the company in the morning?

136
00:12:49,196 --> 00:12:52,065
Emilia, it's pointless to be shy.

137
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:55,204
You must know what you want
and say it.

138
00:12:55,276 --> 00:12:58,888
- I know some things I want.
- Such as?

139
00:12:58,956 --> 00:13:01,738
To take class with the company.

140
00:13:01,803 --> 00:13:05,545
Had I understood 38 years ago
what I was getting myself into,

141
00:13:05,611 --> 00:13:09,889
I'd never have started
this bloody ballet company.

142
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:14,502
I had just one thought.
"We need a first-class American company."

143
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:18,761
- But you've got a lot of foreigners in yours.
- Dance is international.

144
00:13:18,827 --> 00:13:21,761
My company's almost gone under five times.

145
00:13:21,835 --> 00:13:24,868
But here we are,
the best ballet company in the world.

146
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:27,689
Well, in this country, anyway.

147
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:30,470
- Is that the way you were brought up?
- Yes.

148
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,994
Your mother.

149
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:38,915
Well, I want her and your father
to introduce me to some rich oil folk.

150
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:42,085
They have a ballet school, dearie,
and that always means

151
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:46,628
a half a dozen rather lumpy little girls
with very rich daddies.

152
00:13:46,699 --> 00:13:49,186
Now, I won't interfere
with their business, Janina.

153
00:13:49,258 --> 00:13:53,797
I know how to handle the rich.
You give them hope, they give you money.

154
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,033
Don't put that ham away.

155
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:59,271
Save the commercial, Adelaide.
Janina hasn't got a penny.

156
00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:01,735
- She should open a restaurant.
- Thank you.

157
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,996
It's a choreographer's prerogative
to keep his ideas to himself.

158
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:27,046
But, Arnold, must you be so secretive? Tell
us a little something about your new ballet.

159
00:14:30,186 --> 00:14:32,771
There won't be a swan onstage.

160
00:14:34,058 --> 00:14:38,979
- That's a little something.
- But not enough to guarantee you'll do it?

161
00:14:39,881 --> 00:14:44,867
- Don't run, Adelaide.
- I told you Michael and I will do our best.

162
00:14:44,937 --> 00:14:47,206
And I never run.

163
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:50,784
Deedee?

164
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:54,206
How do you get anywhere with her?

165
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:58,783
By realizing she knows
exactly what she's doing.

166
00:14:58,858 --> 00:15:03,647
Oh, by the way, we'd like to have
a new ballet for Emma this season.

167
00:15:03,721 --> 00:15:08,903
Oh, you don't have to use her, Arnold.
It's just a thought.

168
00:15:12,137 --> 00:15:15,585
- Oh, were you pleased with Emma tonight?
- Yes, very.

169
00:15:16,169 --> 00:15:18,176
I made Emma, Janina.

170
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:21,638
No, she didn't. Michael made Emma.
But you helped, Adelaide.

171
00:15:21,704 --> 00:15:24,901
Booze brings out the nit-pickers.
I could have helped make you.

172
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:29,159
- Really, Mom?
- Were you as good as Emma, Mom?

173
00:15:29,225 --> 00:15:32,967
- I was different.
- Very. From the day you both joined us.

174
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:35,204
Different how?

175
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:38,433
Your mother preferred to get married.

176
00:15:40,937 --> 00:15:44,068
- Well, good night, all.
- I'll walk you to the car.

177
00:15:44,137 --> 00:15:47,071
- Good night.
- Coming. Good night.

178
00:15:54,504 --> 00:15:57,820
God, dancers have ugly feet. Ugh.

179
00:15:57,896 --> 00:16:04,093
If I were a man, I could have had all the feet...
I mean children... I wanted, and still danced.

180
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:06,143
How many children?

181
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,862
Three. Like yours.

182
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,535
And a husband like Wayne.

183
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,088
Yes.

184
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,713
You're a very lucky girl.

185
00:16:21,576 --> 00:16:23,747
Wanna change places?

186
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:29,730
No, I can't see you
teaching a pack of klutzy kids.

187
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:36,413
Or living in a town
where the company finally, finally comes.

188
00:16:36,487 --> 00:16:40,742
And when they do, it's for a two-night stand.

189
00:16:40,807 --> 00:16:43,709
No, you picked the life you wanted, Emma.

190
00:16:45,895 --> 00:16:47,902
So did you.

191
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,523
No, not really.

192
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:56,063
You didn't let me.

193
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,481
- How not?
- "How not?"

194
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:06,913
We've picked up some fancy-schmancy
expressions along the way, haven't we?

195
00:17:06,983 --> 00:17:09,601
Deedee...

196
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:12,868
I honestly don't know
what you're talking about.

197
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:16,709
<i>- Remember Michael doing Anna Karenina?
- Yes, of course I do.</i>

198
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,393
- Who did he rehearse for the part of Anna?
- You and me.

199
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:21,634
And?

200
00:17:22,951 --> 00:17:24,773
And...

201
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,989
- You got pregnant.
- Yeah.

202
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:31,811
And you got 19 curtain calls.

203
00:17:31,878 --> 00:17:33,700
Oh, Deedee.

204
00:17:35,142 --> 00:17:36,571
Deedee...

205
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,121
- You resent me for that?
- No, not for that.

206
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,092
Would you like to change places?

207
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:47,647
I don't get 19 curtain calls any more.

208
00:17:47,719 --> 00:17:52,453
But somebody will in something else,
and it won't be me.

209
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,517
Remember Dahkarova?

210
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:59,813
Well, she lives in an apartment
in Carnegie Hall that's as old as she is,

211
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,944
splattered with photographs
of herself as Giselle.

212
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:05,436
She coaches...

213
00:18:05,509 --> 00:18:07,484
when she can.

214
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:10,427
She rents rooms to dancers when she can.

215
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:16,959
She was a great ballerina. She was our idol.
But Michael never considered her for Anna.

216
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,517
She was too old.

217
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:21,789
Exactly.

218
00:18:22,405 --> 00:18:25,056
Well, that's a fact of life, Emma.

219
00:18:27,526 --> 00:18:31,868
And I have to take class in the morning.
That's another fact of life.

220
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,700
Hi, Mom.

221
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,623
Ethan... Ethan?

222
00:18:58,021 --> 00:19:00,126
Women aren't allowed in here.

223
00:19:00,197 --> 00:19:02,652
I suppose the game was called
on account of rain.

224
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:05,791
It wasn't a game, only practice.

225
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:08,414
- You're gonna get kicked off the team.
- I won't.

226
00:19:08,485 --> 00:19:11,900
- Oh, you think you're so valuable?
- No. But they do.

227
00:19:13,765 --> 00:19:15,554
Get dressed. Out. Go home.

228
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:18,490
- It's Dad's advanced class.
- I know the schedule.

229
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:21,565
I'm not gonna miss that class,
so you can save your breath.

230
00:19:21,637 --> 00:19:25,117
You save yours.
Now, get this straight, young man.

231
00:19:25,188 --> 00:19:28,930
You wanna play baseball, finish practice.
You wanna dance, be on time.

232
00:19:28,996 --> 00:19:33,087
I prefer baseball, because athletes last
a lot longer and make a lot more money,

233
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:37,215
but either way you follow the rules.
You got it?

234
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:39,484
I got it.

235
00:19:44,452 --> 00:19:46,208
OK, second group, please.

236
00:19:47,044 --> 00:19:49,859
See you in the rehearsal later. Bye.

237
00:19:49,924 --> 00:19:52,029
Be ready.

238
00:19:53,732 --> 00:19:56,067
<i>Préparation. Music start.</i>

239
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,579
Turn. Heel forward.

240
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:09,565
Continue. Come on, girls.
Together. Not too late.

241
00:20:12,932 --> 00:20:15,779
Everywhere she's studied,
she's been on scholarship.

242
00:20:15,844 --> 00:20:19,226
She studied with Carmelita
in Los Angeles, again on scholarship.

243
00:20:19,492 --> 00:20:22,142
Thank you. Boys, please.

244
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:27,741
She's danced professionally
in Houston and Santa Fe.

245
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:30,528
Lots of money in Santa Fe.

246
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:35,866
And pause. Hold it. Pause.
Girls, continue immediately.

247
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:41,274
Arabesque. Feet close.
All the time in proper position.

248
00:20:41,507 --> 00:20:44,507
Take the time right.

249
00:20:46,627 --> 00:20:48,220
Good.

250
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:52,706
Proper ending,
and the whole combination to the left side.

251
00:20:52,771 --> 00:20:56,731
Deedee and Wayne did a good job.
What do you think, Adelaide?

252
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:05,790
Dad, is it true that Yuri does doubles in the air
then a twist, and comes down on one knee?

253
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:07,746
- That's what I heard.
- Jesus.

254
00:21:07,843 --> 00:21:11,138
My girlfriends couldn't care
if he did triples and landed in a split.

255
00:21:11,202 --> 00:21:13,952
- They just like to see him in his tights.
- And you don't?

256
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:18,971
No. Dancers are boring. They're all in love
with themselves. It's those mirrors.

257
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,569
Dad, did you hear that?

258
00:21:20,642 --> 00:21:23,130
Mom and Dad are teachers,
not dancers. You're neither.

259
00:21:23,202 --> 00:21:25,504
- Is that so?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

260
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,545
- Mom...
- If you don't know by now...

261
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:31,512
- They asked me to join the company.
- Oh, Emilia.

262
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,174
Quiet. Quiet.
When do you start?

263
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:41,056
With rehearsals in New York
before the summer season.

264
00:21:41,122 --> 00:21:43,260
But, Daddy, I didn't tell them I'd go.

265
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,766
- Jerk.
- Ethan!

266
00:21:44,834 --> 00:21:47,649
- I said I wanted to think it over.
- Why, for God's sake?

267
00:21:47,714 --> 00:21:51,129
'Cause she's got more brains than you.
She knows it's the fork in her road.

268
00:21:51,202 --> 00:21:54,137
- The what?
- Don't laugh. It is.

269
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:56,926
And I want to know where I'm going.

270
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:59,709
Right. Why shouldn't you?

271
00:22:00,769 --> 00:22:03,617
That's very smart of you, Emilia.

272
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,160
Let's eat.

273
00:22:08,865 --> 00:22:11,997
The air conditioner in the office
is still on the fritz.

274
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:16,473
Yeah, I know. Thanks, hon. They said
they'd fix it first thing in the morning.

275
00:22:16,577 --> 00:22:20,952
They always say that,
they just never say which morning.

276
00:22:24,161 --> 00:22:27,773
Why do you think she's hesitating
about joining the company?

277
00:22:27,841 --> 00:22:30,426
She won't say it
but she feels funny about leaving us.

278
00:22:30,497 --> 00:22:32,570
I do too. Even funnier.

279
00:22:33,249 --> 00:22:37,755
I have this image of Janina
going off to college, and then Ethan, and...

280
00:22:39,489 --> 00:22:44,093
You know that Emma travels
with these three little dogs?

281
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:47,706
- Would you rather Emilia didn't go?
- No.

282
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:50,623
God, no.

283
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:55,838
I don't want her to spend the rest of her life
buried here in Oklahoma City.

284
00:22:55,905 --> 00:22:59,799
I was thinking - if she does go,
you should go to New York for the summer.

285
00:22:59,872 --> 00:23:01,628
You always baby her.

286
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:03,965
She doesn't make friends as easily as Janina.

287
00:23:04,032 --> 00:23:06,520
She will, in the company.

288
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:09,559
There's always a lot of jealousy
in the company.

289
00:23:09,665 --> 00:23:14,618
Well, that never bothered you.
Why don't you go? Why should I go?

290
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:18,037
You know you wanna go,
you know we have to keep school open,

291
00:23:18,112 --> 00:23:20,959
and you know
I'm a better teacher than you are.

292
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,952
Only in the summer.
It's too damn hot here for me.

293
00:23:25,024 --> 00:23:28,221
Besides, I can't leave the other kids.

294
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:34,426
Well, Janina's happy as a clam here, and she
takes good care of the house. And Ethan...

295
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,878
Oh, Ethan would kill
to go to New York and study.

296
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,927
So?

297
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,676
You know me too well.

298
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:46,810
I would love to go there.

299
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:49,749
I think you have to.

300
00:23:49,824 --> 00:23:54,014
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No, trying to hold onto you.

301
00:23:56,767 --> 00:24:00,728
- I thought it over, but I have two questions.
- Sure.

302
00:24:01,535 --> 00:24:04,153
Ethan says I'm scared of competition. I'm not.

303
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:08,572
But it's a big company,
so how much will I get to dance?

304
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:11,705
Depends on how good you are.

305
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,531
Well, how good am I?

306
00:24:15,071 --> 00:24:16,980
Very. Now, what's the other question?

307
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:20,055
Should I know now
whether I want to stay in the company?

308
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:22,582
What made you ask that?

309
00:24:22,655 --> 00:24:26,517
Well, it seems if you really stay,
there are things you have to give up.

310
00:24:30,047 --> 00:24:33,757
You nut. You deal with that
when and if it happens.

311
00:24:33,823 --> 00:24:37,532
But for now, if you know
what you want to do then you do it.

312
00:24:38,015 --> 00:24:41,113
- It's not always that easy to know.
- Oh, it is for me.

313
00:24:41,182 --> 00:24:43,571
I mean, I know what I want for now.

314
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:45,534
What?

315
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:47,453
Just to dance.

316
00:24:48,702 --> 00:24:51,549
Then go ahead.

317
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,699
Left hand on the barre.

318
00:25:32,765 --> 00:25:34,740
Shoulder down. Arm. And...

319
00:25:38,173 --> 00:25:40,507
Grand plié.

320
00:25:43,006 --> 00:25:45,755
One shoulder back.

321
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:49,650
Open. Look over your hand. Feet together.

322
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:57,497
<i>Lift your arm. Port de bras. Front. One...</i>

323
00:26:21,053 --> 00:26:23,606
Watch.

324
00:26:23,677 --> 00:26:26,906
No. In the middle of the movement. That's it.

325
00:26:26,972 --> 00:26:29,460
Perfect.

326
00:26:29,533 --> 00:26:32,020
<i>OK, now développé. Pull it up. Keep your pull.</i>

327
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:35,475
One, two, three.

328
00:26:35,549 --> 00:26:38,996
And one, two, three.

329
00:26:39,068 --> 00:26:41,076
A little late. Three.

330
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:45,850
And one. Your toes will be in fifth position.

331
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,983
Last time. Again.

332
00:26:55,548 --> 00:26:57,523
- Don't...
- I'm sorry.

333
00:26:59,516 --> 00:27:00,890
- OK.
- That's enough.

334
00:27:00,956 --> 00:27:03,858
How can you dance on it
if you can't even stand a Band-Aid?

335
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:08,120
And one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

336
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:12,531
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

337
00:27:12,955 --> 00:27:15,573
Now, behave.
You're on a scholarship so be grateful.

338
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:18,131
I am. And it keeps me off the streets,
like you said.

339
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:21,204
You better not be so smartass
with your teachers.

340
00:27:21,436 --> 00:27:23,541
So long, Mom.

341
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:26,840
- No.
- You don't wanna be seen with me?

342
00:27:26,907 --> 00:27:30,704
- Don't you have anything better to do?
- Frankly, I don't.

343
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,121
Well, let me go first.

344
00:27:39,995 --> 00:27:41,970
Control.

345
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,586
One. Stay.

346
00:27:46,843 --> 00:27:49,080
And a-one.

347
00:27:49,147 --> 00:27:51,154
<i>Grand finale.</i>

348
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:53,779
Shit.

349
00:27:57,595 --> 00:28:00,442
Hello, Florence.
Is Adelaide around, by any chance?

350
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:03,376
No, sorry.
She had a fundraising meeting, Mrs Rodgers.

351
00:28:03,451 --> 00:28:05,425
Deedee, Deedee.

352
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:09,401
...five, six, seven, eight.

353
00:28:09,467 --> 00:28:11,638
One, two, three, four,

354
00:28:11,707 --> 00:28:13,812
five, six, seven, eight...

355
00:28:25,851 --> 00:28:28,698
- Sevilla. How are you?
- Oh, hello.

356
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,609
That's as far as I got.

357
00:29:15,193 --> 00:29:18,008
Interesting.

358
00:29:18,073 --> 00:29:20,659
Thank you, everybody.

359
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:25,648
Shall I show you your solo now?

360
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,720
Please do.

361
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:40,599
You have three piqué turns
to two chaénés and plié.

362
00:29:40,665 --> 00:29:45,073
- Arabesque. Preparation fourth.
- Double pirouette, right?

363
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:47,665
You can do a single.

364
00:29:47,737 --> 00:29:49,973
I can do a double.

365
00:29:52,761 --> 00:29:55,860
- Where do you want my head here?
- Down and to the side.

366
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:57,904
Fascinating.

367
00:30:00,121 --> 00:30:03,437
You know, Arnold, it might help
if you told me what I was playing.

368
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,520
There's no story, Emma. It's abstract.

369
00:30:05,593 --> 00:30:10,579
I'm aware of that. I asked what I was playing,
not who I was playing. What am I feeling?

370
00:30:10,681 --> 00:30:13,234
Nothing, Emma. You just dance.

371
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:17,102
Arnold...

372
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:20,078
you've got the wrong lady.

373
00:30:27,128 --> 00:30:29,779
Just watch your blood pressure, Arnold.

374
00:30:29,848 --> 00:30:34,517
I did not say that if we don't use Emma,
we won't put on your ballet.

375
00:30:34,584 --> 00:30:40,083
I did say that with Emma it will get
the serious attention it deserves.

376
00:30:41,656 --> 00:30:45,485
Actually,
that's why you showed it to her, isn't it?

377
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,211
I was surprised Emma Jacklin
wanted to be in it.

378
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:51,182
Why? Emma's always worked
with young choreographers...

379
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:53,262
Michael.

380
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:57,843
I'm in bad need of a new ballet, Arnold,
and you know it.

381
00:30:57,912 --> 00:31:00,050
Now, we're using each other, so play fair.

382
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:01,581
You're very talented.

383
00:31:01,656 --> 00:31:06,773
Talented enough to change it, so that
you can use me at what I can do best. Now.

384
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:10,035
I'd like to, Emma, but it's not that simple.

385
00:31:11,064 --> 00:31:13,616
- Your ambivalence is showing.
- Don't get bitchy.

386
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:18,805
- I'm not referring to your sex life.
- Ballets are for dancers, not to oblige stars.

387
00:31:19,543 --> 00:31:22,642
I'm afraid Arnold wants his choreography
to be the only star.

388
00:31:22,711 --> 00:31:24,566
It is, and it should be.

389
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,954
So you don't want me.

390
00:31:31,543 --> 00:31:33,931
Well, then, it is that simple.

391
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:41,171
Your choreography looked very good
on Emilia. Use her. She'll surprise you.

392
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:58,003
Back to work.

393
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:03,220
The little bastard didn't even have the grace
to talk me into staying in his bloody ballet.

394
00:32:04,182 --> 00:32:06,451
Drink slowly.

395
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:10,708
<i>By the way, you and Freddie
aren't doing any Giselles this season.</i>

396
00:32:11,959 --> 00:32:15,025
- Trying to scare the hiccups out of me?
- No.

397
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:17,744
Sevilla's doing two,
then she alternates with...

398
00:32:17,814 --> 00:32:20,149
Carolyn.

399
00:32:20,214 --> 00:32:22,767
You picked a lovely time to tell me, Michael.

400
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,740
Better to get everything
dumped on you all at once.

401
00:32:25,814 --> 00:32:28,748
Better for whom?

402
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:31,539
I'm the artistic director, Emma.

403
00:32:31,606 --> 00:32:36,974
You tell me when and how
you'd say it to an artist you respect.

404
00:32:38,037 --> 00:32:40,045
And a friend.

405
00:32:43,158 --> 00:32:45,743
Poor Freddie.

406
00:32:45,813 --> 00:32:49,774
You know we're only getting paid
by the performance this season.

407
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:52,017
No, I didn't know.

408
00:32:54,005 --> 00:32:57,802
Well, the hiccups are gone, too.

409
00:33:15,445 --> 00:33:18,925
Now, if I can just find
something to put these in...

410
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:23,754
You know, everything she has in here
is either an icon, a samovar or broken.

411
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:26,000
Usually all three.

412
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:31,117
- "D D Vanyo phone?"
- What?

413
00:33:31,188 --> 00:33:33,938
That's what it says, I think.

414
00:33:34,997 --> 00:33:40,048
Oh, that's from last night. You have to learn
how to break Dahkarova's code.

415
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:42,189
- "Wayne phoned."
- Yep.

416
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:46,729
He's so smart. He knew
if he gave me enough rope I'd hang myself.

417
00:33:46,804 --> 00:33:49,171
- How's Janina?
- She's OK.

418
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:55,117
Crazy. Hates ballet, loves Oklahoma.
How did I raise one normal child?

419
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:58,504
Now, this will pass for a vase.

420
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,068
Oh, Em, if I could just get that teaching job.

421
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:05,810
And all I need is Adelaide's OK,
but I can't get the old bitch on the phone.

422
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:08,910
Who's she coaching?

423
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:15,214
Oh. The blonde, with the big eyes.
She's been coming over. Carolyn.

424
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:16,720
Yes.

425
00:34:20,499 --> 00:34:24,755
<i>I just heard Carolyn's going
to be doing Giselle this season.</i>

426
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:29,642
Oh, dammit. I will not get the hiccups... again.

427
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:35,856
Put your arms up. How about
if I kill Adelaide? I'd like to anyway.

428
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:39,753
Don't blame Adelaide.
It's not her fault. I swore I'd quit at 35.

429
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:42,217
And 36, 37...

430
00:34:45,427 --> 00:34:48,013
And then I closed my eyes.

431
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:53,546
How old were you
when you started taking lessons?

432
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,205
Eight.

433
00:34:56,435 --> 00:34:57,995
I was seven.

434
00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:00,684
- Our bodies always objected.
- I know.

435
00:35:00,755 --> 00:35:06,090
But you didn't stay around long enough
to find out they revolt.

436
00:35:06,163 --> 00:35:08,913
And too soon.

437
00:35:09,011 --> 00:35:11,661
They just refuse to do what one wants.

438
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:14,829
They can't.

439
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:23,436
But even now, there are moments
when it comes together.

440
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:26,765
The music, the dancing...

441
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:30,671
the lights...

442
00:35:30,738 --> 00:35:32,626
the costumes...

443
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:38,124
Well, you wanted to know
what it was like to be me.

444
00:35:40,882 --> 00:35:44,427
Deedee, all I'm doing offstage
is just waiting to get back on.

445
00:35:49,202 --> 00:35:51,090
How about a beer?

446
00:35:51,187 --> 00:35:53,194
- I beg your pardon.
- No, tea.

447
00:35:53,426 --> 00:35:55,946
- I'll make it.
- No, you sit.

448
00:35:59,154 --> 00:36:04,904
- I'm gonna talk to Adelaide about your job.
- Don't talk to Adelaide about a damn thing.

449
00:36:06,002 --> 00:36:08,969
Will you tell me something?

450
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:15,054
Why do the problems of people like you seem
so much more important than my problems?

451
00:36:17,458 --> 00:36:21,866
- It's obvious. You're more important.
- Well, if I am, it's not for long.

452
00:36:21,938 --> 00:36:26,760
A couple of years ago
Dahkarova was coaching me.

453
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,005
Today, Carolyn.

454
00:36:29,074 --> 00:36:31,408
But next year...

455
00:36:32,497 --> 00:36:34,505
Emilia.

456
00:36:35,698 --> 00:36:37,607
- Emilia?
- Oh, yes.

457
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:41,228
She's really that good?

458
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:45,767
- I think she's gonna do it for you, Deedee.
- That's it, that's better.

459
00:36:46,897 --> 00:36:49,614
Excuse me.
Mrs Rodgers, could...

460
00:36:51,153 --> 00:36:54,699
- Emma, you're here.
- Still.

461
00:36:56,433 --> 00:37:00,491
- What do you want, Carolyn?
- A glass of water, please.

462
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,653
Ah, kettle is boiling.

463
00:37:06,993 --> 00:37:09,065
- Emma.
- Madame.

464
00:37:12,881 --> 00:37:17,420
- I'm sorry.
- Why? It's not your fault.

465
00:37:17,488 --> 00:37:20,871
- I understand.
- Yes. I understand too.

466
00:37:20,944 --> 00:37:25,833
I went through the very same thing.

467
00:37:31,217 --> 00:37:32,526
Carolyn.

468
00:37:32,976 --> 00:37:35,431
- Cup of tea?
- Thank you, Emma.

469
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:39,017
<i>Getting ready for my first performance
of Giselle is so difficult...</i>

470
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:42,088
Stop talking. Sit.

471
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,186
- Any little cakes, Deedee?
- Cakes? Certainly. Anybody else?

472
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,653
- I'd love some. What kind do you...
- No.

473
00:37:49,136 --> 00:37:51,045
- Hello, Momma.
- Hi, sweetie. How...

474
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,738
Emma. Hello, Mme Dahkarova. Hello, Carolyn.

475
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,815
Emma, Arnold was so mean after you left.

476
00:37:55,887 --> 00:37:59,183
- But he'll give you the part?
- I knew it was your idea.

477
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,895
- Would you like some tea, darling? Emilia?
- Please.

478
00:38:01,968 --> 00:38:04,389
- A lot of Arnold's scowls and mutterings?
- Yes.

479
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:06,635
- You'll get the part.
- What part?

480
00:38:06,703 --> 00:38:09,573
- In Arnold's new ballet.
- Who, Arnold? Good ballet?

481
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:11,557
It's a good part for Emilia.

482
00:38:11,632 --> 00:38:14,632
Then you must help and coach her.

483
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:22,152
All right.

484
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,594
I will.

485
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:26,730
But, Emma... you? Coaching?

486
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,589
Nonsense. I do it. It's necessary
to teach someone else be good like me.

487
00:38:31,663 --> 00:38:34,892
But, Madame, you don't... You're not...

488
00:38:34,959 --> 00:38:38,090
I don't what? I'm not what?

489
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,981
I think what Carolyn means is that
you don't dance any more and I do.

490
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,160
- Who helped you the most?
- Kschessinska.

491
00:38:45,423 --> 00:38:47,725
From Mariinsky to me.

492
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:51,468
From me to you while I still was dancing.

493
00:38:51,535 --> 00:38:58,889
<i>Now to Carolyn, and very soon to you, Emilia,
if you work sur les pointes every day.</i>

494
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:36,934
- Opening nights are so exciting.
- Aren't they?

495
00:39:37,006 --> 00:39:40,137
<i>I wish you were doing
the first Giselle tonight, not Sevilla.</i>

496
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:43,686
It takes all the running you can do
to stay in the same place.

497
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,645
Pardon?

498
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:49,059
<i>It's from Alice in Wonderland, dear.</i>

499
00:39:49,134 --> 00:39:53,705
- It goes down a little bit?
- No, it just follows the natural line.

500
00:39:53,773 --> 00:39:55,879
Yeah, just out just a little bit.

501
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:57,575
- Can I try it again?
- Sure.

502
00:39:59,758 --> 00:40:01,165
It's wonderful.

503
00:41:11,532 --> 00:41:13,671
Remind me to ask you about something.

504
00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:42,628
And one and two and three and four

505
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:45,217
and five and six and seven and eight.

506
00:43:45,481 --> 00:43:48,034
And three. Two and three and four

507
00:43:48,105 --> 00:43:50,788
and five and six and seven. Close eight.

508
00:43:55,753 --> 00:43:58,022
A little faster.

509
00:44:09,001 --> 00:44:11,871
- Not bad.
- Don't spoil me, dear.

510
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:14,880
Well, would you rather
I buttered you up like Adelaide does?

511
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,919
Why don't we butter each other up?

512
00:44:17,993 --> 00:44:23,492
You're revolting. And about as subtle as she
is. This morning she came up to me and said:

513
00:44:23,593 --> 00:44:27,815
"Sevilla, dearie, you're the greatest
prima ballerina in the whole world."

514
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,091
No, I am.

515
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:32,706
Gosh, that is awkward.
We ought to try that again, that lift.

516
00:44:32,776 --> 00:44:36,835
The reason Adelaide goes on and on is
she knows I want to dance in Milan and Rio.

517
00:44:36,905 --> 00:44:40,614
- She's determined I'll do that bloody tour.
- Well, you don't say no.

518
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:45,056
- That's exactly what Richard said.
- Who is Richard?

519
00:44:45,129 --> 00:44:48,031
- Sevilla, long-distance phone call for you.
- Coming.

520
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:50,471
Excuse me, please. I won't be a moment.

521
00:44:51,049 --> 00:44:53,896
Richard is why
I'm not going to end up like Emma.

522
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:59,552
I hate to be interrupted for phone calls.
Could I have the second cast, please?

523
00:44:59,624 --> 00:45:03,715
Let's go from the wheelbarrow.
Ready? And...

524
00:49:55,715 --> 00:49:58,104
You can turn on the light, it's OK.

525
00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:01,757
- I didn't mean to wake you.
- You didn't.

526
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,036
I was with Yuri.

527
00:50:10,658 --> 00:50:13,626
- Are you OK?
- Oh, yes.

528
00:50:13,699 --> 00:50:16,415
I've been taking the pill.

529
00:50:16,483 --> 00:50:18,817
Just in case.

530
00:50:18,914 --> 00:50:21,532
Good God.

531
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:25,595
There's nothing to worry about.
Go to sleep now.

532
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:41,761
- Don't you wanna talk?
- No.

533
00:50:41,826 --> 00:50:44,247
It might spoil it.

534
00:50:44,481 --> 00:50:47,710
- Go back to bed. Sleep well.
- Oh, Emilia.

535
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:49,949
- Be glad for me, Momma.
- I am.

536
00:50:52,065 --> 00:50:56,189
I am, I just didn't think it would...
it would be so soon that you...

537
00:50:56,257 --> 00:50:58,843
That I what?

538
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:03,062
That you wouldn't just... wanna dance.

539
00:51:03,137 --> 00:51:05,112
Oh, Mom.

540
00:51:06,402 --> 00:51:08,857
Go back to bed.

541
00:51:08,961 --> 00:51:10,903
Go on. It's OK.

542
00:51:13,921 --> 00:51:15,929
Go on.

543
00:51:27,745 --> 00:51:29,054
- How are you?
- OK.

544
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:31,128
Let's go.

545
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:56,831
About once a week,
Dad and I would check out all the new stuff.

546
00:51:56,896 --> 00:52:02,842
And Emma and I would go up to the third
floor, try on all the most expensive dresses.

547
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,181
Once we stayed so long
we missed rehearsals...

548
00:52:05,408 --> 00:52:08,191
Hey, I'll see you later.

549
00:52:08,449 --> 00:52:11,580
...stay up there for hours,
trying these dresses...

550
00:52:11,648 --> 00:52:13,819
Oh, Rosie.

551
00:52:16,416 --> 00:52:19,450
- Meet my children. This is Emilia and Ethan.
- Hi.

552
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:22,836
Joe Rosenberg, the conductor
of the company when Dad and I were in it.

553
00:52:22,912 --> 00:52:25,661
- He was the best.
- I still am.

554
00:52:25,728 --> 00:52:27,833
Only now I conduct musicals.

555
00:52:27,903 --> 00:52:31,831
More bread and a permanent pad.
Hey, where are you goin'?

556
00:52:31,903 --> 00:52:35,132
There. We live at Carnegie Hall.
How's your wife, Joe?

557
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,534
Which one? I've had two since I last saw you.

558
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,575
No. Well, how's all three of them?

559
00:52:39,648 --> 00:52:41,851
Dynamite. I never see 'em.

560
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,753
- How's whats his name?
- Wayne.

561
00:52:45,824 --> 00:52:48,987
In Oklahoma with our other daughter.
We're here for the summer.

562
00:52:49,056 --> 00:52:52,219
Terrific. I'm loose.

563
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:57,503
You gave up the ballet
to conduct on Broadway?

564
00:52:57,567 --> 00:53:02,171
- You are a man without soul.
- And you are a woman without wine.

565
00:53:02,399 --> 00:53:05,399
- Did he bring this wine?
- Yes, he brought it.

566
00:53:05,471 --> 00:53:07,097
Taste, he got.

567
00:53:07,167 --> 00:53:10,483
- You have much soul, darling.
- But not much taste.

568
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,501
Correct.

569
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,647
- I'll get it.
- "I'll get it."

570
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:16,661
Shut up.

571
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,742
Hello?

572
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,039
- Deedee, it's honor to Emilia.
- "Honor"?

573
00:53:26,110 --> 00:53:31,228
- Yuri is the best dancer I know in years.
- Of course, my dear. He's Russian.

574
00:53:31,455 --> 00:53:33,430
Correct.

575
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:36,153
And, believe it or not,
Linda's been accepted at Yale.

576
00:53:36,222 --> 00:53:38,710
I guess nobody wants
to go to Princeton any more.

577
00:53:38,783 --> 00:53:40,692
Well, obviously not my kids.

578
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:44,628
All five picked different schools,
but not one picks my alma mater.

579
00:53:44,702 --> 00:53:48,695
- Would you say that was a reflection on me?
- No, Carter.

580
00:53:48,766 --> 00:53:51,221
I'd say that was a reflection on Princeton.

581
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:53,875
You're biased.

582
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:56,154
For years.

583
00:53:58,495 --> 00:54:03,099
- Excuse me, Miss Jacklin.
- Just put 'em down anywhere.

584
00:54:09,086 --> 00:54:12,534
- Obviously I can't kiss you here.
- It wouldn't upset me.

585
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:15,027
It might upset Maggie.

586
00:54:15,102 --> 00:54:17,207
Enough to give you a divorce?

587
00:54:17,438 --> 00:54:21,213
All I'd have to do is ask for a divorce, Emma.
You know that.

588
00:54:21,437 --> 00:54:22,866
Well?

589
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:27,098
- Would you give up dancing?
- Why not?

590
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:30,581
I asked you 15 years ago. 14 years ago. 13.

591
00:54:30,654 --> 00:54:32,923
Ask me now.

592
00:54:36,701 --> 00:54:38,708
You know, I...

593
00:54:38,781 --> 00:54:43,571
I've always wondered -
what do you do with all these flowers?

594
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:48,090
Give them to hospitals.

595
00:54:50,845 --> 00:54:52,819
Emma...

596
00:54:54,077 --> 00:54:56,891
You know one of the reasons
we've lasted so long?

597
00:54:56,989 --> 00:54:58,713
Tell me another, Carter.

598
00:54:58,781 --> 00:55:03,799
Because the whole arrangement
has suited you. You liked the limitations.

599
00:55:05,437 --> 00:55:07,445
I'm not so sure I do any more.

600
00:55:09,117 --> 00:55:11,419
Well, now I do.

601
00:55:11,485 --> 00:55:13,656
I'm sorry.

602
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:19,865
So am I.

603
00:55:19,933 --> 00:55:21,908
Come in.

604
00:55:26,076 --> 00:55:28,443
Well, I guess I'd better be running along.

605
00:55:30,845 --> 00:55:33,714
Would you rather I didn't stop by later?

606
00:55:34,716 --> 00:55:36,953
No, stop by.

607
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:40,086
We might as well finish out the season.

608
00:55:40,156 --> 00:55:42,523
See you later.

609
00:55:53,052 --> 00:55:55,769
Really, you are crazy. Stay.

610
00:55:55,836 --> 00:55:59,862
- Yuri, my mother would have a fit.
- Then she is also crazy.

611
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:03,063
She's just a very proper lady.

612
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:05,914
- You're crazy. I can't.
- Yes.

613
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,939
- Half an hour, then.
- No, all night.

614
00:56:15,387 --> 00:56:17,427
Please.

615
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,474
Why?

616
00:56:21,051 --> 00:56:23,539
I'm homesick.

617
00:56:27,803 --> 00:56:32,407
Now turn your back
to the new direction and look up.

618
00:56:32,796 --> 00:56:35,992
Spot over your hand-arm line.

619
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:39,059
OK, good. Second group, please.

620
00:56:45,019 --> 00:56:47,736
<i>Let's do a port de bras. Be ready.</i>

621
00:56:47,803 --> 00:56:49,494
And...

622
00:56:49,563 --> 00:56:51,832
Don't tighten your shoulder.

623
00:56:51,898 --> 00:56:53,524
Very soft.

624
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:58,806
- You're late.
- Why you come so late?

625
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,046
Stuck in the bathroom.

626
00:57:04,507 --> 00:57:07,092
- Boys, see the ink lighters?
- Lines. Together.

627
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:11,417
- They're flashing.
- Straight lines, please. Arms. Don't forget.

628
00:57:46,138 --> 00:57:49,204
I had more than
just the hots for you back then.

629
00:57:49,434 --> 00:57:52,598
But back then I didn't look so good in tights.

630
00:57:52,666 --> 00:57:55,481
Now the toe shoe's on the other foot.

631
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:57,433
- Is it, now?
- Yeah.

632
00:57:57,498 --> 00:57:59,669
Now we both don't look so good in tights.

633
00:57:59,769 --> 00:58:02,868
- You speak for yourself.
- I am.

634
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:06,865
I can open up new vistas for you, my sweet.

635
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,791
Dancers are dumb.

636
00:58:11,866 --> 00:58:15,608
I mean, what do you know?
Babies and ballet, right?

637
00:58:15,673 --> 00:58:19,863
Well, what do you know
except for music and divorce, right?

638
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:23,988
One moment for station identification, please.

639
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:28,115
Books. Corruption. Dirty pictures.

640
00:58:32,057 --> 00:58:34,097
Divorce is a bummer,

641
00:58:34,169 --> 00:58:36,056
violets are blue.

642
00:58:36,121 --> 00:58:39,155
Tchaikovsky is great...

643
00:58:39,385 --> 00:58:41,010
and so are you.

644
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:45,108
That's nice. I needed that.

645
00:58:47,641 --> 00:58:52,856
Back in the icebox age,
I had an apartment on West 52nd Street. You...

646
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,473
You left before the best part.

647
00:58:57,081 --> 00:59:01,041
- You don't remember, do you?
- Yes, I do.

648
00:59:01,112 --> 00:59:03,600
It was over a jazz joint.

649
00:59:05,944 --> 00:59:08,977
Don't... leave now.

650
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,007
- Feel better?
- Much.

651
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:57,454
- It was my own fault, Yuri.
- Nah.

652
00:59:57,528 --> 01:00:00,724
- I was so nervous.
- Why?

653
01:00:00,823 --> 01:00:05,613
You're so fabulous. And I have weak knees.

654
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:07,859
I like girls with weak knees.

655
01:00:07,928 --> 01:00:10,797
- You just like girls.
- Very much. Is wrong?

656
01:00:10,871 --> 01:00:17,232
No. I personally think everyone should have
the right to make their own choice.

657
01:00:17,463 --> 01:00:19,983
- I like yours.
- My what?

658
01:00:20,055 --> 01:00:22,160
Your choice.

659
01:00:22,231 --> 01:00:26,607
- I'm sorry. My English...
- No, it's mine. I have trouble sometimes.

660
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:31,186
Carolyn, you know,
it sometimes better... not to talk.

661
01:00:31,447 --> 01:00:35,887
- I agree. And particularly with me, because...
- Carolyn.

662
01:00:39,255 --> 01:00:41,011
Yes?

663
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,164
Hello?

664
01:01:25,238 --> 01:01:27,889
<i>- Emilia?
- Daddy.</i>

665
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:29,780
Hi.

666
01:01:30,934 --> 01:01:33,006
How are you? How's Janina?

667
01:01:33,077 --> 01:01:38,707
Janina's taking care of me just fine.
And she's great at the school.

668
01:01:38,774 --> 01:01:40,018
That's good.

669
01:01:40,086 --> 01:01:44,494
Listen, I really had forgotten
how much later it is there.

670
01:01:44,566 --> 01:01:47,118
Daddy, did you hear about
my part in the ballet?

671
01:01:47,189 --> 01:01:50,670
- Yeah, Ma wrote that you got the lead.
- Yeah.

672
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:56,939
Well, don't let that Arnold Berger scare you.
You just sic your boyfriend on him, OK?

673
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:59,021
How is he, by the way?

674
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:03,667
He's OK. I don't really have time
for that sort of thing.

675
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:11,697
I don't wonder. You know, they always work
you a lot harder when you're really good.

676
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:16,044
Put Ma on for a minute, will you?

677
01:02:16,117 --> 01:02:21,780
Mom's with Emma. They're always yakking.
Sometimes she even stays over.

678
01:02:26,773 --> 01:02:29,195
Yeah, well, that's good.

679
01:02:30,453 --> 01:02:35,188
You have her call me when she gets a chance,
OK? Meantime, you get back to bed, and...

680
01:02:35,445 --> 01:02:38,827
Daddy, could you come to New York soon?

681
01:02:38,901 --> 01:02:41,137
You bet, honey.

682
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:45,677
Soon as school finishes, Janina and I are
gonna get on the first plane out of here. OK?

683
01:02:45,748 --> 01:02:48,530
Yes. I love you, Daddy.

684
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,931
I love you too.

685
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:54,827
- Bye.
- Bye.

686
01:03:09,716 --> 01:03:11,723
Up late?

687
01:03:12,596 --> 01:03:14,058
Good morning, darling.

688
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:17,743
Daddy called last night.
I told him you were with Emma.

689
01:03:17,811 --> 01:03:21,553
- Why didn't you wake me?
- It was very late.

690
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,041
Daddy and Janina send their love.

691
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:27,149
Emilia, what time are you
having your lunch today?

692
01:03:27,219 --> 01:03:30,568
I'm busy.
Goodbye, Madame, Ethan.

693
01:03:31,604 --> 01:03:33,906
Something's funny.

694
01:03:37,108 --> 01:03:39,791
One, two, three, four.
Two, two, three four.

695
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,964
Three, two, three, four.
Four, two, three four.

696
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:45,810
Five, two, three, four.
Six, two, three, four.

697
01:03:47,187 --> 01:03:48,616
Emilia...

698
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:52,040
all that emotion is terrific...

699
01:03:52,116 --> 01:03:54,571
<i>for the mad scene in Giselle, not for my ballet.</i>

700
01:03:54,644 --> 01:03:59,116
You're not an uptight village virgin. You're
just a body moving in space with music.

701
01:03:59,187 --> 01:04:01,097
<i>Not to music, with music.</i>

702
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:04,880
That's what dancing is. So please
don't fly around the room emoting.

703
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:09,104
Don't think. Just move as I tell you to move
to the counts I give you. OK?

704
01:04:09,203 --> 01:04:11,145
I don't count.

705
01:04:11,379 --> 01:04:13,550
Then how do you know
what to do when? ESP?

706
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:17,132
I feel it, with the music. And I make it fit.

707
01:04:17,203 --> 01:04:20,399
Well, don't feel it. Count it.

708
01:04:20,466 --> 01:04:22,059
Where were we, Peter?

709
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:25,872
Bar 132... with no feeling, please.

710
01:04:43,826 --> 01:04:47,470
- Look over here. Cute, ain't she?
- She's real pretty.

711
01:04:54,674 --> 01:04:57,423
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

712
01:04:57,490 --> 01:05:01,865
I was wondering if you could
settle a little wager we just made.

713
01:05:01,938 --> 01:05:06,543
We're from out of town,
and we bet you are too.

714
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:08,617
Right?

715
01:05:09,554 --> 01:05:11,528
See, I knew it.

716
01:05:11,601 --> 01:05:14,601
Bartender, get us another round over here.

717
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:21,457
- This is...
- I'm Barney Joe. Lake Charles, Louisiana.

718
01:05:21,522 --> 01:05:23,529
And...

719
01:05:25,809 --> 01:05:29,704
I'm Bill Britt, from Amarillo, West Texas.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

720
01:05:29,778 --> 01:05:31,982
Where are you from?

721
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:35,116
Leningrad, Soviet Union.

722
01:05:35,186 --> 01:05:38,699
No kidding? What are you doing here?

723
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:41,836
I need artistic freedom.

724
01:05:41,906 --> 01:05:43,913
Hey, what are you, anyway?

725
01:05:43,985 --> 01:05:47,629
Artist. Is why I need artistic freedom.

726
01:05:51,569 --> 01:05:53,958
That blows me away.

727
01:06:01,137 --> 01:06:04,682
Now, what are you
saving them cherries for?

728
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:08,808
I save them for supper.

729
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:15,627
- Oh, no.
- What?

730
01:06:15,728 --> 01:06:18,598
- Is time to go.
- Oh, no, don't leave.

731
01:06:27,856 --> 01:06:32,591
Hey, you forgot your...
You forgot your briefcase.

732
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:36,169
Listen, why don't you come on back, now?

733
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,156
I have a marvelous man for that, Sevilla.

734
01:06:42,416 --> 01:06:44,936
No injections, Emma.
I faint at the sight of a needle.

735
01:06:45,008 --> 01:06:47,790
Just massage.
I'll leave his number in your room.

736
01:06:47,856 --> 01:06:50,027
- Thank you, darling.
- Clear the stage.

737
01:06:50,128 --> 01:06:52,778
Would everyone clear the stage?

738
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:58,505
Take the house to half. Conductor, stand by.

739
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:01,708
Hi.

740
01:07:02,672 --> 01:07:05,486
What in the world did you take?

741
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:11,530
Cherries, for remembrance.

742
01:07:13,007 --> 01:07:15,724
Let me out of here.

743
01:07:15,791 --> 01:07:17,700
- Here.
- It's cold in here.

744
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,375
You can do it. You can do it.

745
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:33,189
Five. Six. Seven. Eight.

746
01:08:06,766 --> 01:08:09,865
Something's wrong.

747
01:08:09,935 --> 01:08:12,488
I'm not quite sure, but she's really wonked.

748
01:09:16,429 --> 01:09:18,120
Sorry.

749
01:09:24,621 --> 01:09:28,037
Take this. Hang on. You'll be OK.

750
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:38,696
Not a word to Adelaide. I'll tell you
all about it in my dressing room. Bye-bye.

751
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:46,435
- Emilia...
- She's OK.

752
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:05,002
Go.

753
01:10:15,916 --> 01:10:17,825
Yes, I agree.

754
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:23,017
The right partner is absolutely essential.
And Michael was so good for me.

755
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:26,978
- What happened?
- He became a choreographer.

756
01:10:27,052 --> 01:10:31,940
Now, my dear child...
you should get some sleep.

757
01:10:32,012 --> 01:10:33,987
Oh, not yet.

758
01:10:35,084 --> 01:10:37,767
I meant, what happened
between you and Michael?

759
01:10:40,812 --> 01:10:45,700
- Priorities.
- He liked boys better than girls?

760
01:10:45,771 --> 01:10:48,804
Not then. I... Well, how should I know?

761
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:52,552
We didn't talk about it
quite so openly in those days.

762
01:10:52,619 --> 01:10:55,172
I meant Michael knew
that my priority was dancing.

763
01:10:55,243 --> 01:10:57,829
Are you sorry?

764
01:10:57,899 --> 01:11:02,820
No, I don't believe in being sorry.
We are what we are.

765
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:04,899
Am I like you?

766
01:11:06,539 --> 01:11:09,124
I don't know.

767
01:11:09,195 --> 01:11:13,156
- Now, listen, shouldn't you call home?
- I'd only wake Ethan.

768
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:16,168
Emma, I've stayed at Yuri's a lot.

769
01:11:17,931 --> 01:11:20,964
Emilia, you continually surprise me.

770
01:11:21,035 --> 01:11:22,791
And me.

771
01:11:22,858 --> 01:11:25,673
I wish I knew who I was.

772
01:11:25,738 --> 01:11:27,975
- You will.
- When?

773
01:11:28,043 --> 01:11:31,752
Something happens.
There's always a moment.

774
01:11:31,819 --> 01:11:35,114
- Maybe when Yuri wants to come back.
- I don't want him back.

775
01:11:35,211 --> 01:11:38,822
Course, I'd love to dance with him,
and I love going to bed with him.

776
01:11:38,890 --> 01:11:42,720
But I wanted it to be more,
and that gets in the way, doesn't it?

777
01:11:42,795 --> 01:11:44,966
Which do you want the most?

778
01:11:47,947 --> 01:11:51,721
Both? Well, that's something to dream about.

779
01:11:55,882 --> 01:11:58,435
- Good night.
- Good night.

780
01:12:03,498 --> 01:12:04,960
Emma?

781
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:07,489
It's so nice here.

782
01:12:07,562 --> 01:12:09,570
I'm glad.

783
01:12:18,347 --> 01:12:20,550
...I have simply got to reach him.

784
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:22,658
- May I?
- Of course.

785
01:12:22,763 --> 01:12:25,578
- Hello, Emma.
- Michael, your call to London.

786
01:12:25,643 --> 01:12:27,912
I'll take it here.

787
01:12:27,978 --> 01:12:34,623
Emma, look at the poster Michael unearthed.
Our very first gala performance.

788
01:12:34,698 --> 01:12:39,073
- You were still dancing. You too, Michael.
- You were in the corps de ballet.

789
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:41,001
Well, I'm behind a desk now.

790
01:12:41,066 --> 01:12:44,841
Never mind. We've all kept this company
going, and that's what matters.

791
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:48,899
Yes, another year, another gala.
They remind me of the Olympics.

792
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:52,450
Dearie, you're not nervous after all this time?

793
01:12:52,522 --> 01:12:54,977
All right, I'll call back in an hour.

794
01:12:55,050 --> 01:12:57,385
This is going to be a super gala.

795
01:12:57,450 --> 01:13:00,068
Marcia and Richard
are coming from Stuttgart, and...

796
01:13:00,138 --> 01:13:03,935
- Do you suppose they'll travel tourist?
- Now, Adelaide.

797
01:13:04,010 --> 01:13:07,654
I hear you're also going to do
Arnold's new ballet.

798
01:13:07,722 --> 01:13:08,550
Dearie...

799
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:12,098
No, no. I was just wondering
if Emilia was going to be invited to the party.

800
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:15,013
So she will.

801
01:13:42,153 --> 01:13:44,640
It's very pretty.

802
01:13:49,161 --> 01:13:51,550
Why are you angry?

803
01:13:51,625 --> 01:13:53,152
- Why are you?
- I'm not.

804
01:13:53,416 --> 01:13:56,995
You damn well are, you're just
covering it up with ice, like Emma.

805
01:13:57,065 --> 01:14:03,011
That horny little Russian behaved
like a bastard so you take it out on me.

806
01:14:06,569 --> 01:14:11,325
I didn't hide anything from you.
I brought Rosie here. You knew exactly...

807
01:14:11,401 --> 01:14:14,500
- I gotta wash my hair.
- Come here. Come here, Emilia.

808
01:14:14,569 --> 01:14:19,970
You'll sit down. I wanna talk,
you'll listen to me. I'm still your mother.

809
01:14:30,664 --> 01:14:36,676
When Daddy and Janina come,
do you want them to see us like this?

810
01:14:38,664 --> 01:14:41,152
You wanna hurt them too?

811
01:14:43,656 --> 01:14:47,747
- Talk. Can we talk it out?
- There's nothing to talk about.

812
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,402
Stop punishing me.

813
01:14:51,656 --> 01:14:54,023
Look at me.

814
01:14:54,088 --> 01:14:56,608
Look at me, please.

815
01:14:58,984 --> 01:15:03,970
You know, Daddy and I have been
away from each other all summer.

816
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:06,495
Daddy wouldn't do what you did.

817
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:09,950
- How do you know?
- I know Daddy.

818
01:15:10,023 --> 01:15:12,445
Like you know Yuri?

819
01:15:13,992 --> 01:15:18,945
I'm the only louse?
Come on, Emilia. Be fair.

820
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,520
You hurt, I... I know.

821
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:28,320
And I understand. I can help you.

822
01:15:28,391 --> 01:15:32,701
Let me. Don't shut me out, sweetheart.
We're friends.

823
01:15:32,775 --> 01:15:35,677
Nobody can help you better than I can.

824
01:15:35,751 --> 01:15:37,922
Nobody knows you better than I do. Nobody.

825
01:15:38,023 --> 01:15:42,845
Momma. You're really just
angry about Emma, aren't you?

826
01:15:42,919 --> 01:15:44,577
No.

827
01:15:44,647 --> 01:15:47,549
Emilia, I love you.

828
01:15:47,847 --> 01:15:49,669
I may have seemed like a monster,

829
01:15:49,767 --> 01:15:54,623
but it was to help you understand what my
ballet is, not what you wanted to make it. I...

830
01:15:54,695 --> 01:15:58,011
Bravo, Arnold. Keep talking like that.
She'll be more hysterical.

831
01:15:58,087 --> 01:16:00,574
- I'm not hysterical.
- I'm not hysterical either.

832
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:03,843
- I don't know why you're not.
- What do you mean by that?

833
01:16:03,911 --> 01:16:07,489
Maybe you're right. Some lousy gala,
biggest night of season.

834
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:09,948
It's only your biggest opportunity...

835
01:16:10,054 --> 01:16:13,699
Emilia's biggest opportunity...
It's really nothing special.

836
01:16:13,767 --> 01:16:16,701
- I have to go to the john again.
- Are you all right?

837
01:16:16,774 --> 01:16:19,873
Don't worry about him. He'll be all right.

838
01:16:19,942 --> 01:16:24,317
I have little secret for you. You know,
I think it's perfectly all right to be nervous.

839
01:16:24,390 --> 01:16:27,488
- Really?
- Really. I know.

840
01:16:27,558 --> 01:16:29,827
Dance well.

841
01:16:31,014 --> 01:16:35,454
I'm not at all surprised. You know,
if we sell out the last two weeks,

842
01:16:35,526 --> 01:16:39,454
we end the season
with a deficit of less than 80,000.

843
01:16:39,526 --> 01:16:42,493
- Imagine.
- About the price of your necklace.

844
01:16:42,566 --> 01:16:44,671
Oh, no, Dennis. This is paste.

845
01:16:44,742 --> 01:16:47,076
The real one went for...

846
01:16:47,142 --> 01:16:49,891
- What did it go for, Michael?
- The musicians' strike.

847
01:16:49,957 --> 01:16:52,379
Oh, yes. Pigs.

848
01:16:52,454 --> 01:16:57,855
Oh, hello, Mrs Stewart. I love the Stewarts.
They gave us $25,000 last year.

849
01:16:58,790 --> 01:17:00,132
Emilia?

850
01:17:00,294 --> 01:17:02,977
Oh, don't you look nice.

851
01:17:04,038 --> 01:17:08,293
- You should see the glamour out front.
- I don't wanna think about it.

852
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:11,423
<i>- You're doing Anna.
- The suicide scene.</i>

853
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:16,512
All the other ladies will be in short tutus
and do at least a hundred pirouettes.

854
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:20,607
So this not-so-young lady will be
covered to the floor and act up a storm.

855
01:17:20,677 --> 01:17:22,881
This is a knockout.

856
01:17:22,949 --> 01:17:25,338
Wanna be my date for the party?

857
01:17:25,413 --> 01:17:28,315
- Or do you have one?
- No, that's kaput.

858
01:17:28,389 --> 01:17:32,131
Terrific dress you gave Emilia, too.
But you shouldn't have.

859
01:17:33,541 --> 01:17:36,476
Why not? She's my godchild.

860
01:17:36,549 --> 01:17:39,897
You just shouldn't have, that's all. Good luck.

861
01:18:41,988 --> 01:18:46,046
Even now, there are moments
when it all comes together.

862
01:18:46,115 --> 01:18:49,431
The dancing, the music, the lights...

863
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,447
Your mother chose to get married.

864
01:22:25,824 --> 01:22:28,376
You got 19 curtain calls.

865
01:22:29,376 --> 01:22:31,765
And you got pregnant.

866
01:23:11,934 --> 01:23:16,309
I can't watch it any more.
They're too old for it. That depresses me.

867
01:23:16,382 --> 01:23:18,935
I'm too old to do another one.
That depresses me more.

868
01:23:19,006 --> 01:23:23,349
It's a beautiful ballet, Michael.
It'll live forever.

869
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:25,430
Why can't we?

870
01:23:26,430 --> 01:23:28,699
Why aren't you watching?

871
01:23:28,766 --> 01:23:33,338
It hurts. I keep seeing me and Emma
rehearsing for you.

872
01:23:35,742 --> 01:23:39,004
Hey, if I ask you a question,
will you answer me truthfully?

873
01:23:39,070 --> 01:23:40,477
What?

874
01:23:40,542 --> 01:23:46,390
Jesus, can you believe this?
I've wanted to ask it for 20 years.

875
01:23:46,462 --> 01:23:48,349
OK.

876
01:23:51,646 --> 01:23:55,672
If I hadn't been pregnant, would you have
used me as Anna instead of Emma?

877
01:23:57,182 --> 01:24:00,444
I don't remember, Deedee.

878
01:24:01,790 --> 01:24:04,343
Honestly, I don't.

879
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:07,065
I wish to God I didn't.

880
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:13,722
Hurry up. You're going to miss my ballet.

881
01:25:14,908 --> 01:25:18,072
I think she's gonna do it for you, Deedee.

882
01:25:44,604 --> 01:25:46,709
It's wonderful.

883
01:25:46,780 --> 01:25:48,951
I've gotta take my bow.

884
01:26:56,058 --> 01:27:00,433
- To Emilia, dearie.
- I'm so glad for her.

885
01:27:00,506 --> 01:27:04,914
Tradition is continuity,
and thank God I've lived to see it.

886
01:27:04,987 --> 01:27:08,303
Second generation in our own family.

887
01:27:08,379 --> 01:27:12,307
And yours, of course. Now,
what should we do with our baby ballerina?

888
01:27:12,698 --> 01:27:16,081
<i>I think she'd be lovely in Sleeping Beauty.</i>

889
01:27:16,346 --> 01:27:19,695
Perfect. We'll warm her up this season,

890
01:27:19,770 --> 01:27:23,032
and then she'll warm up the box office
the next season.

891
01:27:23,098 --> 01:27:25,815
- Do you want to tell her?
- No.

892
01:27:26,650 --> 01:27:29,105
- I think it's a fabulous idea.
- I do too.

893
01:27:29,338 --> 01:27:33,397
Isn't it wonderful? Aren't you excited?
I'm so proud of you. I was so excited...

894
01:28:02,809 --> 01:28:05,776
- Has anyone seen my bitch of a wife?
- Now, dearie.

895
01:28:05,849 --> 01:28:08,020
<i>Very smart of you to do Anna.</i>

896
01:28:08,089 --> 01:28:11,537
Next time you'll have to lift me, Emma.
My back is ready for traction.

897
01:28:11,609 --> 01:28:13,780
- Oh, poor Freddie.
- It's worth it.

898
01:28:13,849 --> 01:28:17,297
- You know what we'd like you to do, Emma?
- A new ballet?

899
01:28:17,369 --> 01:28:20,369
- Tradition makes a company...
- This is "tradition" night.

900
01:28:20,441 --> 01:28:22,677
Oh, shut up, Michael.

901
01:28:22,745 --> 01:28:26,836
<i>I'd like to restore the full-length
Sleeping Beauty to our repertoire.</i>

902
01:28:26,904 --> 01:28:30,483
Oh, thank you very much,
but I don't think I could dance that any more.

903
01:28:30,553 --> 01:28:33,848
No. But you could stage it.

904
01:28:33,913 --> 01:28:37,393
You know it inside out.
It'd be fun, a new challenge.

905
01:28:37,497 --> 01:28:41,839
She'd do it beautifully.
Don't you think so, Michael?

906
01:28:41,912 --> 01:28:45,327
I think your timing's lousy, Adelaide.

907
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:49,590
Excuse me.
I really must do something to my face.

908
01:28:54,808 --> 01:28:56,696
For God's sake, Adelaide.

909
01:28:56,760 --> 01:29:00,437
Dearie, even Emma has to move on.

910
01:29:00,504 --> 01:29:03,570
Like all the rest of us.

911
01:29:06,296 --> 01:29:08,817
Hello, Deedee.

912
01:29:08,888 --> 01:29:11,375
Champagne, please.

913
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:28,367
Emma?

914
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:37,554
Do you remember the fairy tales
we used to take turns reading to Emilia?

915
01:29:37,655 --> 01:29:40,819
Like the one about the two princesses?

916
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:46,357
Every time one would open her mouth,

917
01:29:46,424 --> 01:29:49,107
out came diamonds and rubies.

918
01:29:49,367 --> 01:29:54,669
Every time the other one opened her mouth,
out came newts and hoptoads.

919
01:29:56,759 --> 01:29:59,607
Newts and hoptoads, coming out.

920
01:30:02,903 --> 01:30:04,593
Yes.

921
01:30:04,663 --> 01:30:08,592
One of those little toads
has already made an appearance.

922
01:30:08,663 --> 01:30:12,339
- Really? When?
- Tonight, in my dressing room.

923
01:30:12,407 --> 01:30:15,854
When you said I shouldn't have
bought that dress for Emilia.

924
01:30:15,959 --> 01:30:19,756
Twice you said it. Just before a performance.

925
01:30:21,654 --> 01:30:25,680
I danced better tonight than I have in years.

926
01:30:25,750 --> 01:30:27,758
So I heard.

927
01:30:29,399 --> 01:30:36,076
Another little toad. You must have kept
quite a few bottled up all these years.

928
01:30:36,150 --> 01:30:38,833
No.

929
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:40,910
Embalmed, really.

930
01:30:40,983 --> 01:30:43,536
No, I think not.

931
01:30:43,607 --> 01:30:47,665
Why don't you let them out?
I don't have a performance tomorrow.

932
01:30:49,686 --> 01:30:51,508
OK.

933
01:30:55,862 --> 01:30:58,131
Pick.

934
01:31:01,878 --> 01:31:05,839
This is a tiny little one.
I'd practically forgotten him.

935
01:31:08,854 --> 01:31:14,036
Why'd you make your best pal doubt herself?
And her hubby? Why, Emma?

936
01:31:14,102 --> 01:31:17,450
Why'd you take the chance
of lousing up her marriage?

937
01:31:17,525 --> 01:31:21,616
Why'd you say, "You better have that baby.
If you don't you'll never hold onto Wayne?"

938
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:24,533
I'm just curious.

939
01:31:24,597 --> 01:31:27,444
You have a curious memory.

940
01:31:27,510 --> 01:31:32,911
But don't we all. As I remember, I said if you
had an abortion you might lose Wayne.

941
01:31:32,982 --> 01:31:35,665
No. That's sweet, but that's inaccurate.

942
01:31:35,733 --> 01:31:38,700
I remember exactly your words.

943
01:31:38,773 --> 01:31:41,839
For lo, these too many moons.

944
01:31:41,909 --> 01:31:46,165
And eventually I figured out why you
said 'em, because I also remember...

945
01:31:46,389 --> 01:31:49,967
that you said, " Forget about Michael's ballet,
there'll be others."

946
01:31:50,037 --> 01:31:52,404
You clever little twinkle-toes.

947
01:31:53,749 --> 01:31:57,643
You knew a ballet like that comes along
once in a career, and you wanted it.

948
01:31:57,717 --> 01:31:59,953
Real bad.

949
01:32:00,021 --> 01:32:02,770
So you lied to make sure
you got what you wanted.

950
01:32:02,837 --> 01:32:05,390
I never had to lie to get what I wanted.
I'm too good.

951
01:32:05,461 --> 01:32:06,955
Really.

952
01:32:07,925 --> 01:32:08,907
Yes.

953
01:32:08,981 --> 01:32:13,323
And I suppose if you said "bullshit"
you'd say it in French, wouldn't you?

954
01:32:13,397 --> 01:32:17,423
If that word came as naturally to me as to you
I'd have used it several times by now.

955
01:32:17,493 --> 01:32:19,500
In English.

956
01:32:19,572 --> 01:32:22,671
But I think it's more appropriate
that you say it to yourself,

957
01:32:22,741 --> 01:32:26,418
for trying to blame me for what you did.

958
01:32:27,508 --> 01:32:30,355
Deedee, the choice was yours.

959
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:33,039
It's much too late to regret it now.

960
01:32:35,125 --> 01:32:37,775
The same to you, Emma, me darlin'.

961
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:45,933
I don't regret mine.

962
01:32:46,004 --> 01:32:50,477
Then why are you trying
to become a mother at your age?

963
01:32:52,404 --> 01:32:56,976
That's not a little toad.
That's rather a large bullfrog.

964
01:32:57,044 --> 01:33:01,037
I don't wanna be anybody's mother.
I think of Emilia as a friend.

965
01:33:01,107 --> 01:33:04,653
And one reason I tried to help - stupid me -

966
01:33:04,724 --> 01:33:08,619
I thought you'd be happy if your daughter
became what you never could be.

967
01:33:08,691 --> 01:33:12,106
Meaning you. It's so lovely to be you?

968
01:33:12,340 --> 01:33:15,656
- Well, obviously you think so.
- No.

969
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:19,824
And anyway, I doubt if
Emilia could become you.

970
01:33:19,892 --> 01:33:24,048
She's as talented as you are,
and she works as hard.

971
01:33:27,379 --> 01:33:30,991
There's one thing, dearest friend, that you are,

972
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:33,962
that Emilia, poor darling, is not.

973
01:33:34,036 --> 01:33:36,491
And what, pray tell, is that?

974
01:33:36,563 --> 01:33:39,116
A killer.

975
01:33:40,435 --> 01:33:44,047
You'd walk over anybody
and still get a good night's sleep.

976
01:33:44,115 --> 01:33:48,555
That exactly how you got
where you are, Emma.

977
01:34:05,011 --> 01:34:06,953
Good girl.

978
01:34:07,602 --> 01:34:09,610
Deedee...

979
01:34:13,074 --> 01:34:14,667
Deedee...

980
01:34:14,738 --> 01:34:17,389
- I'm sick to death of your jealousy.
- So am I.

981
01:34:17,458 --> 01:34:19,498
Stop blaming your life on me. You picked it.

982
01:34:19,603 --> 01:34:22,505
You picked it. You never let me
find out if I was good enough.

983
01:34:22,578 --> 01:34:27,085
- You weren't. That's why you married Wayne.
- I loved Wayne.

984
01:34:27,314 --> 01:34:30,729
So you said to hell with your career
and got pregnant to prove you meant it?

985
01:34:30,802 --> 01:34:33,420
- Yes.
- Don't lie to me, lie to yourself.

986
01:34:33,490 --> 01:34:35,595
You knew you were second-rate.

987
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:39,146
You got pregnant because Wayne
was a dancer and that meant "queer" then.

988
01:34:39,378 --> 01:34:42,095
- To prove he was a man, you had a baby.
- That's a goddamn lie.

989
01:34:42,353 --> 01:34:45,899
It's the truth and you know it. You saddled
him with a baby and blew his career.

990
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:48,588
Now she's better than you were
and you're jealous.

991
01:34:48,658 --> 01:34:51,080
You're certifiable.
You'll use any excuse.

992
01:34:51,153 --> 01:34:53,674
- What excuse?
- For trying to take away my child.

993
01:34:53,746 --> 01:34:57,608
- I return the compliment. You're a liar.
- And you're a user. You know that?

994
01:34:57,682 --> 01:34:59,885
You're a user, and you always have been.

995
01:34:59,953 --> 01:35:03,630
First me, and then Michael.
Pretending to be in love with Michael.

996
01:35:03,697 --> 01:35:06,796
Then Adelaide, and now Emilia.

997
01:35:06,865 --> 01:35:08,840
- How Emilia?
- "How Emilia."

998
01:35:08,914 --> 01:35:11,052
That display five minutes ago, upstairs.

999
01:35:11,313 --> 01:35:14,346
Curtsy, embrace, applause.
It wasn't for her, it was for you.

1000
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:19,306
You were using Emilia so that everybody in
the room would say, "Isn't Emma wonderful?"

1001
01:35:19,378 --> 01:35:23,785
You are wonderful. You are really amazing.
It is incredible how you keep going on.

1002
01:35:23,857 --> 01:35:26,607
You're over the hill and you know it.
You're terrified.

1003
01:35:26,673 --> 01:35:30,764
All you've got are your scrapbooks,
your old toe shoes and those ridiculous dogs.

1004
01:35:30,833 --> 01:35:32,840
What are you going to fill in with, Emma?

1005
01:35:32,913 --> 01:35:37,801
Not my daughter. You keep
your goddamn hands off my daughter.

1006
01:35:37,873 --> 01:35:41,004
- I'm better for Emilia then you are.
- The hell you are.

1007
01:35:41,073 --> 01:35:46,026
She came to me 'cause her mother wasn't
there. She was busy screwing her head off.

1008
01:35:46,097 --> 01:35:47,952
You bitch.

1009
01:36:17,296 --> 01:36:22,762
You know, if there'd been a photographer
here, you'd have had a whole new career.

1010
01:36:22,832 --> 01:36:25,832
I must look awful.

1011
01:36:25,904 --> 01:36:29,319
No, you don't. You look beautiful.

1012
01:36:29,392 --> 01:36:32,043
I don't know how you do it.

1013
01:36:34,448 --> 01:36:36,936
Give me your comb, I'll show you.

1014
01:36:37,008 --> 01:36:39,855
I'll take this half. Thank you.

1015
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:45,446
I lost an earring.

1016
01:36:46,480 --> 01:36:48,454
I'm sorry.

1017
01:36:50,383 --> 01:36:52,750
- I'm not.
- You're not?

1018
01:36:52,815 --> 01:36:55,815
No. I'm not.

1019
01:36:59,023 --> 01:37:01,478
Boy, that jealousy.

1020
01:37:01,551 --> 01:37:04,006
Its poison, you know?

1021
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:08,585
- It can make you a monster.
- It does make one unfair.

1022
01:37:08,655 --> 01:37:11,590
You got off some bull's-eyes.

1023
01:37:11,663 --> 01:37:13,932
So did you.

1024
01:37:17,807 --> 01:37:19,749
Deedee...

1025
01:37:19,823 --> 01:37:24,842
I don't really remember
what I said about having the baby.

1026
01:37:27,439 --> 01:37:29,708
But I do know...

1027
01:37:34,798 --> 01:37:39,817
I would have said anything
to make sure I got that ballet.

1028
01:37:41,582 --> 01:37:44,430
I just had to have it.

1029
01:37:45,487 --> 01:37:48,782
You were good. Good enough to threaten me.

1030
01:37:58,062 --> 01:38:00,070
Jesus...

1031
01:38:04,399 --> 01:38:06,919
Emma, you don't know...

1032
01:38:09,390 --> 01:38:14,376
how many years
I wanted to hear you say... just that.

1033
01:38:26,766 --> 01:38:30,595
Next bus to midtown Manhattan
in 30 minutes.

1034
01:38:34,094 --> 01:38:38,316
Emma had her all morning, coaching her.
Dahkarova's got her this afternoon.

1035
01:38:38,382 --> 01:38:41,415
- What's all the coaching for?
- OK, surprise.

1036
01:38:41,486 --> 01:38:44,585
Your daughter is dancing with Yuri
on the 15th.

1037
01:38:44,654 --> 01:38:46,726
- He'll wipe her out.
- The hell he will.

1038
01:38:46,797 --> 01:38:49,732
Emma and Dahkarova
have knocked themselves out.

1039
01:38:49,837 --> 01:38:53,481
- Ethan, show Janina her room, please.
- Sure.

1040
01:38:53,549 --> 01:38:56,397
You're going to love it here...

1041
01:38:59,533 --> 01:39:02,631
You wanna see something wonderful? Come.

1042
01:39:04,013 --> 01:39:06,861
Left, right, left, right.

1043
01:39:06,925 --> 01:39:07,940
OK?

1044
01:39:08,013 --> 01:39:09,988
Now, left shoulder. And...

1045
01:39:10,061 --> 01:39:13,061
Left, right. No...

1046
01:39:14,861 --> 01:39:19,433
So remember, it's left, right, left, right.

1047
01:39:19,533 --> 01:39:24,901
You must do it so that really you shine.
Like diamond, you know?

1048
01:39:25,004 --> 01:39:26,597
OK. And...

1049
01:39:26,668 --> 01:39:28,010
One. One. One.

1050
01:39:28,109 --> 01:39:31,425
More close. Close.
That's right, that's right, that's right.

1051
01:39:31,501 --> 01:39:36,389
More this way, this,
instead of this and this, OK?

1052
01:39:37,517 --> 01:39:40,484
Just very sharp. One.
Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.

1053
01:39:40,556 --> 01:39:44,418
That's very good. That's good.
No, it is good.

1054
01:39:46,348 --> 01:39:48,999
You think she can make it, Wayne?

1055
01:39:49,068 --> 01:39:51,752
Will you care if she doesn't?

1056
01:39:52,877 --> 01:39:54,819
No.

1057
01:39:54,892 --> 01:39:57,543
As long as she doesn't.

1058
01:39:58,893 --> 01:40:01,445
Still care you didn't?

1059
01:40:16,652 --> 01:40:20,678
Emma said I married you
'cause I knew I couldn't.

1060
01:40:20,748 --> 01:40:22,984
That's not true.

1061
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:25,702
She said something else.

1062
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:32,391
She said I got pregnant
that first time with Emilia...

1063
01:40:33,804 --> 01:40:37,349
because I wanted to prove to everybody...

1064
01:40:38,507 --> 01:40:40,394
that you weren't gay.

1065
01:40:40,491 --> 01:40:42,498
And that's partly true.

1066
01:40:44,075 --> 01:40:46,082
I knew that.

1067
01:40:47,659 --> 01:40:49,863
You did?

1068
01:40:49,931 --> 01:40:52,614
I had to prove it too.

1069
01:40:53,771 --> 01:40:56,520
So I let you ruin your career.

1070
01:40:57,515 --> 01:41:00,581
No, I saddled you with a family.
You could have been something...

1071
01:41:00,651 --> 01:41:03,498
Me? No, no, no, never. Not me.

1072
01:41:08,971 --> 01:41:11,655
Hey, I got what I wanted.

1073
01:41:22,922 --> 01:41:25,442
So did I.

1074
01:41:58,922 --> 01:42:03,494
- Why you don't ask me?
- Adelaide hates to pay overtime.

1075
01:42:04,713 --> 01:42:08,707
How you supposed to rehearse
without partner?

1076
01:42:10,026 --> 01:42:13,441
You make too much from Carolyn and me.

1077
01:42:14,665 --> 01:42:17,349
But I apologize anyway.

1078
01:42:18,378 --> 01:42:20,614
Keep doing. Come, come, come on.

1079
01:42:27,017 --> 01:42:28,708
So...

1080
01:42:28,777 --> 01:42:31,777
- Can we have supper?
- I'm busy.

1081
01:42:35,817 --> 01:42:38,632
- After supper?
- Bed.

1082
01:42:38,729 --> 01:42:40,933
OK.

1083
01:42:41,033 --> 01:42:42,855
Emilia...

1084
01:42:42,921 --> 01:42:44,547
Is joke.

1085
01:42:44,617 --> 01:42:47,486
I don't think so.

1086
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:49,732
Come on. And...

1087
01:43:03,368 --> 01:43:05,507
That's no joke.

1088
01:43:06,537 --> 01:43:08,708
Nice?

1089
01:43:08,776 --> 01:43:09,987
Yes.

1090
01:43:10,057 --> 01:43:12,478
So smile.

1091
01:43:13,576 --> 01:43:16,064
Let's go on.

1092
01:47:20,900 --> 01:47:22,874
Bravo.

1093
01:48:56,098 --> 01:49:02,011
Emilia, it was marvelous. It was so
wonderful. You... Wasn't she wonderful?

1094
01:49:12,353 --> 01:49:15,004
Up these stairs and to the left.

1095
01:49:16,706 --> 01:49:20,317
Just one more kiss.
Just one more kiss.

1096
01:49:20,385 --> 01:49:22,774
It was so good. Now it's all done.

1097
01:49:22,850 --> 01:49:26,014
Emilia. You were so good.

1098
01:49:26,082 --> 01:49:29,082
- You were so good.
- I just loved you.

1099
01:49:30,305 --> 01:49:35,870
And there he is. There's Yuri.
Yuri, this is my sister Janina.

1100
01:49:48,641 --> 01:49:52,667
You got it? You're kidding me.
You got his autograph?

1101
01:49:59,905 --> 01:50:02,905
You were absolutely wonderful, dearie.

1102
01:50:30,849 --> 01:50:34,678
You were incredible.
That was beautiful...

1103
01:50:58,368 --> 01:51:00,310
Pick a feeling.

1104
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:03,100
Envy.

1105
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:06,010
Her life is just beginning.

1106
01:51:09,023 --> 01:51:11,893
It's not a very long one, Deedee.

1107
01:51:11,968 --> 01:51:13,942
I know.

1108
01:51:15,999 --> 01:51:18,814
Well, as long as it gives her what she wants.

1109
01:51:18,912 --> 01:51:20,887
It will.

1110
01:51:22,911 --> 01:51:24,886
It will.

1111
01:51:26,047 --> 01:51:27,738
Oh, Emma.

1112
01:51:27,807 --> 01:51:31,385
If only she knew everything we know.

1113
01:51:31,455 --> 01:51:34,106
It wouldn't matter a damn.
