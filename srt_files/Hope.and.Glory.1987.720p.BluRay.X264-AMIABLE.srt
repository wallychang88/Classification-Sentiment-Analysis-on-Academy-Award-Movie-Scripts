It was a stray bomb.
Thank you, Adolf.

HEADMASTER:
The school has been destroyed!

1556
01:50:04,557 --> 01:50:08,895
Teachers, keep them away
from that fire. Teachers, fall in!

1557
01:50:09,437 --> 01:50:12,023
Get them into their lines!

1558
01:50:12,190 --> 01:50:15,902
Where's your discipline?
You'll all be punished!

This is war!
And it's not a laughing matter!

1561
01:50:22,742 --> 01:50:24,869
Get them into their lines!

1562
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:26,955
- Get-- Stop it!
- Oh!

1563
01:50:27,122 --> 01:50:28,707
HEADMASTER:
Will you get into your lines!

1564
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:30,166
Who threw that at that teacher?

1565
01:50:30,333 --> 01:50:33,128
- Who threw that box? You!
TEACHER: Stop it!

1566
01:50:33,295 --> 01:50:35,714
You'll regret this.

1567
01:50:36,548 --> 01:50:38,758
Grandpa!

1568
01:50:42,429 --> 01:50:44,973
Get out. Stop that!

BILL: <i>In all my life,
nothing ever quite matched...</i>

1571
01:51:02,407 --> 01:51:04,617

01:51:04,784 --> 01:51:06,619
<i>My school lay in ruins...</i>

<i>...and the river beckoned
with the promise of stolen days.</i>
