1
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:13,053
-Anyone inside?
-Not yet, sir.

2
00:00:13,638 --> 00:00:15,139
-Good morning, Mr Forst.
-Good morning, Mr Forst.

3
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,974
Good morning, Mr Forst.

4
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,649
I have some correspondence
and some papers for you to sign.

5
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:28,318
Don't bother me with that stuff.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,821
-Would you like some coffee?
-No.

7
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,742
-You look lousy.
-You're not in a good mood?

8
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,787
-Anything I can do for you?
-I'll give you a list of my maladies.

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,497
You better give me a cup of coffee.

10
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,958
I don't want to yawn
in Mrs Miniver's face.

11
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,543
-Yes, sir.
-Hmm?

12
00:00:58,516 --> 00:00:59,975
Here you are.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,685
Will you take this thing
out of my mouth?

14
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,520
-Okay.
-Thanks.

15
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:08,984
-Good morning.
-ALL: Good morning, Miss Whiteford.

16
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,945
FORST: Hello, Nita.
How'd they get you out of bed?

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,489
Aw, shut up.

18
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:19,119
Harry. Oh, you know Harry Selfrine.

19
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,122
FORST: Do I know Harry Selfrine?
Do I know Harry.

20
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:23,707
Good morning.

21
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,250
-Jim Mortensen.
-WHITEFORD: Nice boy.

22
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,668
Kazmier, Edward.

23
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,005
Do you know Richard Forst, our manager?

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,634
- Hello, darling. Lang. L-A-N-G.
- How are you, dear?

25
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,429
-Good morning, Mr Draper.
-WHITEFORD: All right.

26
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:40,641
When I was a kid,
we used to play a game called,

27
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:43,018
"Your mother wears army shoes".

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,937
I'm not your mother. Sit down.

29
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,107
--Do you know Frederick P. Draper?

30
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,691
Thank you, Emily Dickinson.

31
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:53,153
-WOMAN: Here you are.
-Thank you very much.

32
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,696
Thank you.

33
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,157
What are you gonna
sell us this time, Harry?

34
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,700
Money.

35
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,745
Actually, it's a very good film.

36
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,998
We call it the, uh,
Dolce Vita of the commercial field.

37
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,542
Is that so?

38
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,502
I don't mean to insinuate
it's a crude film.

39
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,587
We were trying to capture
several approaches.

40
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,172
What Jim means is that we really...

41
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,007
No, no. That's not what I mean at all.

42
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,553
We were talking facts and figures until
we practically went out of our minds.

43
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,638
Losses, gains, ratings, schmatings.

44
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,057
You can lose your mind
if you keep analysing things like that.

45
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,185
Then we came up with
an impressionistic document that shocks.

46
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:26,353
Is that so?

47
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,105
I don't think it so much shocks
as it's honest.

48
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:30,858
It's honest,
but it's a good piece in itself.

49
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,944
So, you see, we're a little nervous
about hitting you with this.

50
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,655
Oh, now, they've got nothing
to be nervous about.

51
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,783
It's a shot in the dark,
but it's strong and it's attractive.

52
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,286
It better be
better than the last one, Harry.

53
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,621
I think I'll loan you my sleeping pills.

54
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,915
You know, I have insomnia

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,669
and I stay awake all night looking
at pictures, worrying about pictures.

56
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,212
I walk all over the place.

57
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,463
Let's see it, J.P.

58
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,798
I'd rather hear 'em talk about it again.

59
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,843
MAN: We'll talk about it later.
FORST: J.P.

60
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,636
All right, Arnold. Roll it.

61
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,822
FREDDIE: You're after my money, huh?

62
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,410
You're not gonna drink this? Too bad.

63
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,412
Never let good liquor go to waste.

64
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,165
# Never let it go to waste
Never let it... #

65
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,000
Ida. Ida, I adore you.

66
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,085
Never let good liquor go to waste.

67
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,922
-Arrivederci! Ciao!
-MAN: Go on. Beat it.

68
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,507
-Scusa pleasa. Bye-bye.
-MAN: So long, sucker.

69
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,934
I'll drive. I'll drive.
Give me the keys. Give me the keys.

70
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,311
Give me the keys. I'll drive.

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,672
FORST: Don't make any noise, Jeannie.
Here, Freddie.

72
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,507
--No, no, Freddie.

73
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,175
FREDDIE: Drink, drink, drink.
FORST: Freddie.

74
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,761
--Drink, drink, drink, drink.

75
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,513
-Come on.
-No, I don't care if we wake 'em.

76
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,723
We'll get 'em all a drink.

77
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:11,143
Let everybody come in and have a drink.

78
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,827
# I got drunk tonight
-Shh!

79
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,541
# I got drunk tonight
like I never got drunk before

80
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,211
# When I'm drunk I'm happy as can be

81
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:41,798
# I am a member of the Souse family

82
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:45,344
# The Souse family is the best family

83
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,555
# That ever came over from old Germany#

84
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:53,769
Oh. Oh, boy.

85
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,940
-Shh!
-Ah!

86
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,403
# Deck the halls with boughs of holly

87
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,698
# Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

88
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,494
-What are you doing?
# 'Tis the season to be jolly

89
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,789
# Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

90
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,085
# Troll the ancient Yuletide carols

91
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:20,504
# Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la #

92
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:23,924
FORST:
What the hell are we doing here?

93
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,057
There's just... All of a sudden,

94
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,102
we just joined the clan
of I-don't-give-a-damners.

95
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,270
Wake up and have a good time

96
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,897
before the bad fairy comes
and makes it midnight!

97
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:43,902
Say, listen. If there's anything
I can't stand, it's a bad fairy.

98
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,196
What the hell do you know
about Cinderella?

99
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,449
Look, now. Sit down.
I wanna tell you something.

100
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:52,536
Just sit down. Sit down.

101
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:58,166
Don't let this sophisticated
exterior fool you.

102
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,129
I believe in Aesop's Fables
and Walt Disney.

103
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,922
All right, Freddie. Okay. All right.

104
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:06,425
"All right" my left eyeball!

105
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:09,845
We met at a bar.

106
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,097
-Right, Jeannie?
-Right.

107
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,725
And it was love at first sight.
Right, Jeannie?

108
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,937
-Right.
-We were thrown out by Morey.

109
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:21,815
But we had laughs.

110
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,150
-Right?
-Right!

111
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:25,152
Shut up. Who asked ya?

112
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,279
Listen.

113
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,035
I think Forst is a holier-than-thou.

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,456
-I am not.
-FREDDIE: Who asked ya? Now, cool it.

115
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,584
You go to a psychiatrist,
don't you, Dickie?

116
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,794
-No, I don't.
-JEANNIE: Well, you look Freudian.

117
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:46,089
-I never even met a psychiatrist.
-He looks like Sigmund.

118
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,925
- JEANNIE: Yes, he does!

119
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,762
Do you know that Freud said if you go to
the bathroom, it's supposed to be sexy?

120
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:55,348
Oh! Oh! Oh!

121
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,393
Sick, sick, sick, sick!

122
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,691
Come on, now. Wait a minute.

123
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,277
Wait a minute!
What the hell are we talking about?

124
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,904
-JEANNIE: Who cares?
-Who cares?

125
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:11,781
Yeah. For a minute or two we act stupid.
We have a good time.

126
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:15,452
Who does it hurt? I mean,
who makes up the rules anyway?

127
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,955
I mean, always play it cool,
always put everybody down.

128
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,500
Standing around a corner
looking out the side of your eye,

129
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,876
see if anybody's lookin' at ya.

130
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,921
-Listen. Hell, fellas. I'm 28...
-FORST: Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

131
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:29,966
I'm 23 years old, and it's time
for me to forget myself, right?

132
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,260
Right!

133
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,473
-Down with the middle class!
-Right.

134
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,309
-Down with the white-collar workers!
-FREDDIE: Down, down, down!

135
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:41,645
-Down, down with the...
-I'll give you the swiftest pain

136
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,313
in the behind that was ever invented!

137
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:46,441
Down with the, uh, lecturers
and do-gooders.

138
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,860
-You know who I hate?
-Down with squealers.

139
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:52,948
-On television!
-I hate cheap people.

140
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,617
Down with hospitals that keep people
waiting until they get paid.

141
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,327
-Right.
-Some hospitals are okay.

142
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,995
Down with hospitals!

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,540
-Don't bully me!
-Don't bully her!

144
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,668
-You shut up.
-Down with gossip columns!

145
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:07,254
FORST: And to hell with politics.
It stinks!

146
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,256
Kill the finks for something!

147
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,343
Down with Sunday schools!

148
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,970
JEANNIE: I like Sunday schools.

149
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,223
--JEANNIE: Hey, I got one.

150
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,891
FORST: What is it?

151
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,602
Down with friendship.
I think it's phony.

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,980
Atta girl!

153
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,482
Oh, wait a minute. You don't know
what you're talking about.

154
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,987
Friendship is a tradition.
Friendship is useful.

155
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,197
Dickie, I got the most terrible friends.

156
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,740
I don't care.

157
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,034
-Sometimes you need a friend.
-So buy a dog!

158
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,538
Oh, I'm talkin' about us, stupid!
Why are you so stupid?

159
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,456
You know how long I've known this jerk?

160
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,377
-Well, Dickie, he's just... Dickie.
-No, no, no.

161
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,212
I'm not one of these guys
who has a few...

162
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,715
-I know. Ah, he didn't mean it.
-Oh. There he is.

163
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,967
Come on out, and to hell with the family
and responsibiIities.

164
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:55,218
JEANNIE: That's right.

165
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:59,180
Come on. Let's ball it up, old buddy.
We don't even know each other.

166
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,349
I'm talking about somebody deep down!

167
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:03,226
-That's right. That's right.
-I'm talk...

168
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:09,024
He's gonna cry. Do something. Freddie!

169
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,942
FORST: I'm talking about something...

170
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:16,990
Oh, Dickie, Dickie, Dickie.

171
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,993
Hi, ho, Silver, away!

172
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:23,079
Get 'em up, Scout!
The Lone Ranger rides again.

173
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:26,207
Masked bandits. Get 'em, Tonto!

174
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,585
Aaah! Aaah!

175
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,378
Aaah! My hand!

176
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,673
Oh, and I shot your hand.
That's a silver bullet.

177
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,301
Hi, ho, Silver, away!

178
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,720
Hey, Jeannie. Hey, Jeannie.

179
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,183
Did you hear the one
about the goose

180
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:47,771
that went down into the subway
and got peopled to death?

181
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,940
Oh, isn't that...

182
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,444
Listen, do you know that Dickie and I...

183
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,281
# Used to do routines in college #

184
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,158
Oh, boy!

185
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,326
Hey, Freddie.

186
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,286
Remember that time
we auditioned for the nightclub?

187
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:07,290
Ah, it closed! Hey, Freddie, let's do
one of our routines for Jeannie, eh?

188
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,501
Come on. Come on. Let's do it.

189
00:11:09,585 --> 00:11:12,504
- Well, come on!

190
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,548
It wasn't funny then, buddy,
and a hundred years wouldn't change it.

191
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,676
Listen, Freddie,
after what I saw on television,

192
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,095
I'm not ashamed of any of our routines.

193
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,306
-Now, come on. Come on.
-Come on. I do want to see it.

194
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,850
-Come on!
-All right! Let's do it.

195
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,521
-Come on, you crazy, shy son of a bitch.
-JEANNIE: Go ahead.

196
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,064
Up on your feet.

197
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,609
Come on. Come on! Come on!

198
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:38,655
-She doesn't want to see it.
-Come on! I'll do that goddamn routine!

199
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:41,741
-No. To hell with ya.
-Come on! Hey, listen. Get this.

200
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:45,787
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great Siegfried!

201
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,415
- JEANNIE: Yay! Yay!

202
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:51,626
Bow! Bow, will ya! Bow!

203
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,628
Aw, come on, Dickie! Bow!

204
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,423
Oh, phooey! Phooey, phooey, phooey!

205
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,466
He spoiled the whole goddamn act.

206
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:02,595
When the drum roll begins,
he's supposed to bow.

207
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:05,306
All right, you big chickens.
I'll do mine.

208
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,809
-Okay, you ready? Listen.
-I'm ready!

209
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,561
Neither one of you's
a communist, are you?

210
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,730
-FORST: Well, uh...
-Oh, I don't care.

211
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,940
I made this up. All right?

212
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,820
# There's a

213
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,240
# Moscow Theatre
where the Reds love to go

214
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:25,952
# To see Sonia the cutie
of the burleskovitch show

215
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,497
# All the commies love her stripping
to the very last man

216
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,625
# They claim it's even better
than the Five-Year Plan

217
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:34,669
# Take it off, take it off

218
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:39,507
# Take it off, take it off

219
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,802
# Take it off, take it off

220
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,180
# But she didn't join the fun #

221
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,849
--FREDDIE: Whee!

222
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,518
JEANNIE: Oh! Oh! Oh!

223
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,979
-Come on, Dickie. Come on.
-What?

224
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,356
Now, listen. Get the picture.

225
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,318
-Stand up there.
-This is a fine...

226
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,278
This is a fine impression
we'll make with the lady, huh?

227
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,821
-Stand up there!
-"Stand up there."

228
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,531
Listen. Get the picture.

229
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,533
-We...
-Boy, this is ridiculous!

230
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,494
-Look, we're gonna do it...
-All right.

231
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,037
...if my heart doesn't give out.

232
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,790
Are you ready? Now, get the picture.

233
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:16,044
Pinpoint spot.

234
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,630
-I got the picture. I got it.
-FREDDIE: Got it?

235
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,384
-Achtung!
-Achtung!

236
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,512
-Right turn!
-Right turn!

237
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,223
-Right turn!
-Shoulders back!

238
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,891
- Back!

239
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,691
Cut.

240
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,075
-Attention.
-Attenzione!

241
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,537
Ooh!

242
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,540
Ta-da!

243
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,418
And I'm supposed to act
like it's all a big mistake.

244
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:02,006
-It's wonderful. You're wonderful.
-FREDDIE: Ooh, Jeannie.

245
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,925
You're great.

246
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,261
And now...

247
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,763
And now, if you'll excuse me,

248
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,933
I'm going into the boudoir to change
into something more comfortable.

249
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,687
Don't worry. You shall feel
many guilt’s but remain pure.

250
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:22,026
Oh. My heart.

251
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,238
It's beating.

252
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,907
-I'm so excited.
-Shit!

253
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,909
Uh-huh.

254
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,619
What are we doin' on our knees?

255
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,249
What is the matter with you?

256
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,088
She's gonna change!

257
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:46,634
Ooh, Dickie. Remember when we didn't
have to worry about our wives and kids?

258
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,428
Oh, God!

259
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,391
Yeah.

260
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,938
Phew.

261
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,943
Mmm.

262
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,987
Remember when we had our own apartment

263
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:09,115
and all the girls would
come up and see us?

264
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,992
And they'd mix drinks for us,

265
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,161
and they would cook us
anything we wanted,

266
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,955
and then they'd give us their money
and go to bed with us.

267
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:17,749
-Don't you remember?
-It never happened.

268
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,667
Of course it did. Don't you remember

269
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,003
Connie and Julie
and what the hell's her name?

270
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,338
-The one with the...
-I don't know.

271
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,926
Oh, my God, Dickie! You're getting old
and grey, and I'm getting fat and grey.

272
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,639
What the hell's she doing in there?

273
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,268
# I dream

274
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:42,941

JEANNIE: Sing it, Dickie.

00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,893
FORST: Hey, uh...

292
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,281
# I dream of Jeannie

293
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:16,951

00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:45,146
# I dream of Jeannie with the light... #

299
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,902
Oh, Freddie.

300
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,946
Aw, Freddie. Aw, no, Freddie.

301
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,241
Don't spoil it, Freddie. Please.

302
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:06,459
Spoil what?

303
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,254
Honey, I'm game for anything.

304
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,633
I just want to know how much you charge.

305
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,426
It's legitimate, isn't it?

306
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,304
I know I have to pay.

307
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:20,306
I'm not too schooled in these things,

308
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,849
but I know somewhere along the line,

309
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,352
your little hand's gonna find its way
into my pocket.

310
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,438
You're shocked, aren't you,
old Dickie, old pal?

311
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,107
What do you think she is?

312
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,192
You think she's some clean towel
that's never been used?

313
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:35,029
FREDDIE: My God, Dickie.
You think you don't pay?

314
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:38,616
How many times a week
does Maria ask you for some money?

315
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,284
Money, Charlie, is a necessity.

316
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:44,372
And don't you think that
you don't work for it and pay for it.

317
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,168
My God, wait. What is this?

318
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,796
He thinks I'm insulting you.
I'm offering you.

319
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,714
Hell, look!

320
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:56,217
What's the matter?

321
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,387
If I went to one of
those fancy restaurants,

322
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,390
I'd probably tip the head waiter,
the waiter, the busboy,

323
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,017
and a hundred bucks
goes flying down the drain.

324
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:08,396
And I couldn't have any more fun
than I could with Jeannie here.

325
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,482
-FORST: Let go of my girl.
-Dickie, wait. Please.

326
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,151
Please. Please. Please.

327
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:14,902
Don't be shocked.

328
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:18,698
It's like this. Fred is a very sad man.

329
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,075
-Now, you...
-Will you let me finish!

330
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,744
Because you're a man
who doesn't say what you mean very well.

331
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:25,621
What you meant was
this was a wonderful evening,

332
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,582
and you enjoy my house and you like me.

333
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,084
But like you said, you're crude.

334
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:38,384
I'm sorry.
Honey, I was only tryin' to be funny.

335
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,136
I thought you said
you were trying to be funny.

336
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:44,807
Well, you go with your... You go!
If you're in such a damned hurry.

337
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,268
My reputation's at stake here!

338
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,956
Ah.

339
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,000
Good night.

340
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,504
Good night, Jeannie.

341
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,302
I'm sorry.

342
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,651
I don't know how you do it.

343
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,488
Well, I just...

344
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,661
I just close my eyes and I...

345
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,456
I see how much liquor I can swallow.

346
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:57,296
I pray that I'll die and be
martyred by the church

347
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,507
for my service to humanity.

348
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,719
You're a lovely girl.

349
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,684
I'm too old to be lovely.

350
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,853
And I haven't got a heart of gold.

351
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,398
The nights are long,
and Little Orphan Annie

352
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,359
of Hard Knoxville
gets tough, you know.

353
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:22,822
I think I'd better go.

354
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,991
Then go ahead! Get the hell out!

355
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,034
Beat it, snowball!

356
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,662
-Right?
-Right.

357
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,707
You're on your own again.

358
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,854
Yeah. Uh-huh.

359
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,231
Mmm-hmm.

360
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,525
Uh-huh.

361
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,409
MARIA: Uh-huh.

362
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,956
Uh-huh.

363
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:17,418
Come here.

364
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:19,920
Well, how did you find that out?

365
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:25,259
It's very important, but I don't think
there's anything you can do about it.

366
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:28,095
-Maria, I want to talk to ya.
-Mmm-hmm.

367
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,765
Mmm-hmm.

368
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,100
Louise, I just came home
from the office.

369
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:37,271
Yes, I had a very hard day
and something important came up.

370
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,607
Can she call you back later?

371
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,818
Uh-huh.

372
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,781
- Uh-huh.

373
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,993
Yeah?

374
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,458
Uh-huh.

375
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,963
Uh-huh.

376
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,967
Louise, we'll call you back later.
Goodbye.

377
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,638
I'm gonna have a drink. You kill me.

378
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:13,641
- Yeah? Why do I kill ya?

379
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,643
Why do I kill ya?

380
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,528
Why do I kill ya, huh?

381
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,613
Why? What do you want to drink?

382
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,282
Whatever it is, I want it on the rocks,
straight and dirty,

383
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:32,952
because I feel
very, very bitchy tonight.

384
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:36,205
Well, I feel very, very bitchy, too.
That makes two of us.

385
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,832
Blue Monday for me today.

386
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:41,669
All day the phone rang and rang.
"Hello, Maria?" "Goodbye, Maria."

387
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:45,714
- "Hello, darling." "Goodbye, darling."
- Hello, darling.

388
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,217
Your sense of humour's
going to destroy our marriage someday.

389
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,802
I wasn't trying to be funny.

390
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,556
Listen, Maria,
go get me a cigarette, will ya?

391
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:56,350
Ooh, we're out! I'm sorry.
I smoked myself silly today.

392
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:59,520
-You're such a conformist.
-Like hell I am!

393
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:02,857
Dickie, why don't you take me
to a movie, okay?

394
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,025
Why doesn't somebody
fill these stupid boxes?

395
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,527
You smoke too much.

396
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,737
There's a Bergman film
in the neighbourhood.

397
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,198
I don't feel like
getting depressed tonight.

398
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,869
But you always love foreign film.

399
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:19,081
-Where the hell are the cigarettes?
-We're out!

400
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:23,836
-What are you getting so huffy about?
-There's nothing on television tonight.

401
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,547
If I had a cigarette, I could think.

402
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,593
-You're hungry.
-Right!

403
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,428
But you're always hungry.

404
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:35,764
That's because I always
come home at dinner time.

405
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:40,519
Oh, I love you when you look like that.

406
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:44,190
Look like what?
Tell me quick, and I'll write it down.

407
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,527
- You wanna fight, huh?
- Yeah, I wanna fight.

408
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,030
Smug. I knew it the first time
I looked at you.

409
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,073
-The better-than-you expression.
-That's right.

410
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,409
I'm the pompous puke of all times.

411
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,078
Yeah, and you smell like a brewery, too.

412
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,581
And I smell like a brewery, too.

413
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,551
And you'll take me to a movie show?

414
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,262
I'll take you

415
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,225
any place that your little heart desires

416
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:25,898
if you'll just keep that lovely mouth
of yours closed for a couple of seconds.

417
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,942
I have a lovely dinner for you.

418
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,154
Come on. Take off your coat
and stay a whiIe, bright eyes.

419
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,406
Well, that sounds like
some kind of a proposition.

420
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:35,950
Oh, Dickie, you're so innocent,

421
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,952
it's hard to get through
to you sometimes.

422
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,079
- FORST: Oh, really?

423
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,302
-No place like home.
-What?

424
00:25:57,597 --> 00:26:00,516
-I said have you ever been to Rome?
-Italy?

425
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,144
I love you.

426
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,605
But you always love me
when I bring food.

427
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,109
-Well, that's because I'm a glutton.
-Were you with Fred tonight?

428
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:13,279
-Yeah.
-I think he's a terrible father.

429
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:16,448
He never talks to the kids
or plays with 'em.

430
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,660
The kids are grown up.

431
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:21,996
Nineteen isn't grown.

432
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,834
I don't like Fred any more.

433
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,503
-Well, why don't you like Fred any more?
-Because

434
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,882
he cheats on his wife.

435
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,724
-Now, who told you that?
-Louise.

436
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,394
Oh, Louise.

437
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:48,981
-Oh.
-Fred talks in his sleep.

438
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:53,694
He comes home at night and he just
stares at her. Doesn't say a word.

439
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:56,322
They have a drink. Silence.

440
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:59,658
-They eat, they say nothing.
-Salt and pepper, please.

441
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:02,536
They get into bed and they say nothing.

442
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,373
And I forgot,
he just barely looks at the kids,

443
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,209
and Louise says
that it's because of that.

444
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,254
Because of what?

445
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:16,383
Well, she reads,
and he just rolls over and goes to sleep

446
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,761
and talks to all these different girls.

447
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:22,723
And Louise says that they have to be
in compromising positions.

448
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,228
Good old Freddie.

449
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:40,407
He says things like...

450
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,243
- Like, "Roll over".

451
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,455
"Let's try that again." Yeah.

452
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:48,999
Things like that.

453
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,251
Things like that, huh?

454
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,004
And do you know what he did with...

455
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,799
Do you know what he did with Darlene?

456
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,635
Darlene? Who the hell's Darlene?

457
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:02,012
The girl in his dream.

458
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,808
Oh.

459
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,770
Well, what did he do with Darlene?

460
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,605
Huh?

461
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,148
You ain't gonna tell me?

462
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,944
He kiss... He kisses her.

463
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,156
You know.

464
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,789
Oh.

465
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,335
You mean, he goes...

466
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,013
You... You mean he goes...

467
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,981
- Bad!

468
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,568
-Is that what you mean?
-No.

469
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,159
- No.

470
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,704
- I... Yes, but...

471
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,879
He says for her to do it to him.

472
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,424
-That's funny.
-When he gets...

473
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:26,180
-Well...
-Well, that's what he said.

474
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:30,350
Yeah, well, you know,
Freddie's getting on in years.

475
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,561
And a man Freddie's age...

476
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,688
You're Fred's age!

477
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:40,027
Yeah, but sexual nightmares
are not one of my problems.

478
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:44,531
Besides, what the hell has that got to
do with Fred being a good father?

479
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,742
Huh?

480
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,620
Well, I...

481
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,042
I'm sorry I talk too much.

482
00:29:55,376 --> 00:30:00,047
Well, you know, Fred puts up
with his kids' asinine friends.

483
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,090
-You know that?
-I...

484
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,718
His kids wanna drink, he lets 'em drink.

485
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,553
They want to smoke, he lets them smoke.

486
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,057
He... Well, he sends
the sons of bitches to college.

487
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,643
They each have their own cars, you know.

488
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,605
And he gives them 50 bucks a week
spending money.

489
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:18,565
Can you imagine that?

490
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,610
And his daughter is beautiful.

491
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:25,489
His son is a big 6'3" hunk of man,

492
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,282
and the girls think he's cute.

493
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:31,912
And he's got Simon, a 1-year-old baby.

494
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,290
I wish I was that kind of a father.

495
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:38,126
Well, we weren't discussing
that part of it anyway.

496
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,797
I'm talking about it
from a woman's point of view.

497
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,340
Oh.

498
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,927
- A woman's  point of...

499
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:51,849
A woman's point of view. Oh, God.

500
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,768
I can't go to the goddamn movie
with you.

501
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,188
Jesus Christ Almighty. Oh, boy.

502
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,861
I can... I can see it all now.

503
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,157
Boy. You know, one of these days,

504
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,785
you girls are gonna go, "Charge!"

505
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,997
And you know somethin' funny?

506
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,793
We'll all surrender,
and you can have everything.

507
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:23,463
You can have the house
and the cars and the office

508
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,966
and the bills and the headaches,

509
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,803
and we'll sit home and laugh!

510
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:32,306
That's what we're gonna do.

511
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,852
All we ask for is peace.

512
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,315
To give us our daily beating and three
square meals a day and bread and water

513
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,817
and we'll just sit staring at the sun,

514
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,652
going blind, okay?

515
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,156
Oh, I'm so sorry. Do we emasculate you?

516
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,658
Poor little boy losing his virility.

517
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:54,077
Well, I don't have it any more!

518
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:58,999
-What happened to it, huh?
-I just don't appeal to you.

519
00:31:59,042 --> 00:32:01,335
Oh, you appeal to me all right.

520
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,503
When I come home, you appeal to me.

521
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,505
When I'm at the office,
you appeal to me.

522
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,549
I am not a sex machine!

523
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,677
-No, you want to go to the movies!
-Because I'm bored.

524
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,846
That's how you get your jollies!

525
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,515
-Don't be crude!
-Crude, schmude. I'm crude!

526
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,601
The minute you get home,
you wanna jump into bed.

527
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,853
FORST: That's the general idea.

528
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:04,815
Why did the man
throw the clock out the window? Huh?

529
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,401
He wanted to see time fly.

530
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:18,245
What does Dracula do
every night at midnight?

531
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:20,747
He takes a coffin break!

532
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:26,086
What is it that's blue and whistles

533
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:30,090
and hangs in a delicatessen?

534
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:42,352
Aren't you gonna say,
"But a herring doesn't whistle"?

535
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,980
Huh? Aren't you gonna say,
"But a herring isn't blue"?

536
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,983
You're not gonna say that?
How can I get to the joke?

537
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:59,286
What is it that weighs 5,000 pounds
and has got a stick through it?

538
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,041
A hippo-popsicle.

539
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:14,509
What is it that's black and white
and red all over?

540
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:17,637
-A newspaper.
-No. A zebra's ass.

541
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,487
You don't think
I'm very funny, do ya, huh?

542
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,989
Of course I think you're funny.

543
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:39,367
Well, I could...
I could be funnier, you know.

544
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:41,078
I really could.

545
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,956
-If I tried a little harder.
-Maybe you're not all that funny.

546
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:52,964
Good night.

547
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,781
-Dickie, I'm sorry.
-I want a divorce.

548
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,926
-Did you hear what I said?
-Oh, Dickie.

549
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,015
I want a divorce.

550
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:29,686
That's the only thing to do, isn't it?

551
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:37,110
Well, why don't you laugh?

552
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,905
It's funny.

553
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,994
Well, what's your answer?

554
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,122
Answer me!

555
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,166
Hello, Jeannie?

556
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,420
Hold on a minute.

557
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,801
I'll send for my clothes in the morning.
I'm not coming back.

558
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,931
I'm on the phone.

559
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,482
This is Richard Forst. Hi.

560
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:00,860
I'd like to see you tonight.

561
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,613
Well, it's very important.

562
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,408
Well, how busy are you?

563
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,956
Well, I could meet you
at the Losers Club.

564
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:15,083
Twenty, thirty minutes.

565
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,420
Take as long as you like.

566
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:20,880
Fine.

567
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,676
I'll see you later.

568
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:48,283
WOMAN: # Wars have come
and wars have gone

569
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:51,619
# History, it goes on and on

570
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,622
# Ever since this world began

571
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:58,084

MAN: # Caesar tried to gain control

573
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:04,966

00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:08,345

575
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:11,806
# And love conquered just as planned

578
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,025
# But when he reached for nine and 10

579
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,028
# Love not war then conquered him

580
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:28,907
# Give up, you're through

581
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,992
# You'll never get away from it

582
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:34,621
# Why try, I'm telling you

583
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:39,751
# This lovin' stuff is here with us

that old Stonewall

00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:56,184
BOTH: # Give up, you're through

589
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,269
# You'll never get away from it

590
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:02,899
# Why try, I'm telling you

591
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:07,237
# This lovin' stuff is here with us
till the day we die

592

593

# Talking to you, friends

00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:18,665
# Love's goin' to get you

595
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,959

# Love #

600
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,323
MAN: If you think I look like silly
in this outfit,

601
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,576
you oughta see me in a bathing suit.

602
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,786
I look like a pair of pliers
with a Band-Aid on.

603
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,916
I'm in such bad shape.

604
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:05,086
- I really am.

605
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,089
I got a frog in my throat.

606
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:11,134
First meat that's passed
that way in an hour.

607
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,349
I just wanted you to see my suit.

608
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,269
Seersucker. Sears made it, and you're
lookin' at the sucker that bought it.

609
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,985
On top of that, I'm so flat-footed,
when I get out of the bathtub,

610
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,238
somebody has to rock me back and forth
to break the suction.

611
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:41,372
But, uh, the postman came with a letter

612
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,543
and told me that the Great Society
was having a war on poverty.

613
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,756
So, uh, I told him if that was true,
I wanted to be the first to surrender.

614
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,661
There once was a girl from...

615
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,829
...who played the violin.

616
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:24,958
Uh, she tucked it under her chin.

617
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,919
She plucked at her strings...

618
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,504
WOMAN: Like angel wings.

619
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:33,841
MAN: She plucked at her strings,
among numerous things,

620
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,385
and tucked it under her chin.

621
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,277
-Well, Mr McCarthy.
-Jim.

622
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,029
Jamie McCarthy.

623
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,824
- Jamie.
- Oh, that's a fine name. Fine.

624
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,077
-My mother used to call me Jamie.
-Did she now?

625
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,037
Say, how would you like
to call me Mother?

626
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,831
Come on, will ya?

627
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,792
I'm old enough to be your father.

628
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:09,711
Listen. Listen.

629
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,671
In that case,
I'd like some fatherly advice.

630
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:13,798
-All right.
-I have a terrible problem.

631
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,508
What's your problem, daughter?

632
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:18,177
-Well, this fellow, a friend...
-Mmm-hmm.

633
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,930
...an Irish friend,
he just called me from the bar,

634
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,100
and he's in terrible trouble
and wants me to come rescue him.

635
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:27,020
-What do you think of that?
-What do you think of it?

636
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,731
Well, I'm asking for your advice.
You're the wise one.

637
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,650
Be a hero. Tell me. Come on.

638
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,237
-Hey, Jackson.
-Yo.

639
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,406
--Hey, Jackson.

640
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,954
Remember the time
we went to New Orleans on a bet?

641
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,749
Yes, sir, I do.

642
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,919
We stayed up all night
screaming at the top of our lungs.

643
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:53,921
We had a...

644
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:55,840
We had a... My nose itches.

645
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,800
-We had a...
-Going to kiss a fool?

646
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,552
Yeah, I know.

647
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,349
We had a couple bimbos.
No, actually, they were very nice girls.

648
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,602
-They reminded me a lot of you two.
-Oh.

649
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,229
But they knew more dirty limericks
than you could shake a stick at.

650
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,397
How nice.

651
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,150
Well, I knew a guy who used to make
them up and sell them.

652
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,944
Really? He must have been an ex-convict.

653
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,572
-That's right. Don't look so wide-eyed.
-I'm not wide-eyed.

654
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,824
Do you realise that
ex-convicts and jailbirds

655
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,785
are the ones that
write all the limericks?

656
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,370
Not all of them.

657
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,830
Oh, don't argue with Mr McCarthy, miss.

658
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,334
Jimmy Arno, he wrote a couple that
were really funny. Didn't he, Jeannie?

659
00:44:31,418 --> 00:44:32,960
-That's right. He did.
-Jimmy Arno?

660
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:36,756
-Mmm-hmm.
-Jimmy Arno? Not the Jimmy Arno.

661
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,841
-Do you know him?
-Never heard of him.

662
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,478
Aw, come on, now.

663
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,897
What the hell do we care
about two whores?

664
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,191
-JEANNIE: You better watch...
-Wait a minute!

665
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,652
-Two whores!
-JEANNIE: I don't want you around!

666
00:44:57,736 --> 00:44:58,986
Come on. Come on.

667
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,072
-You don't want us around?
-That's right.

668
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,200
Look who's saying
she doesn't want us around!

669
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:08,413
-You're coming on awfully strong.
-Just who in the hell are you, huh?

670
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,415
Just who in the hell are you?

671
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,625
Wait a minute. Take it easy.
What's the matter with you?

672
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:14,460
Why be so violent?

673
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,090
Take it easy. Just relax.
Wait a minute, Jeannie. Wait, Jeannie.

674
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,939
I'm sorry.

675
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,568
Can I have a cigarette?

676
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:43,072
Let me close this door.

677
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:48,786
All right. I won't close the door.

678
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,043
Ah, boy, what a life!

679
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:02,800
Ah, what's the matter, Jeannie?
Don't you like me? Hmm?

680
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,304
Why not? Come on. I can take criticism.

681
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,016
Hmm? What's the matter with me?

682
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,019
You don't want me to be crude?
All right, I won't be crude.

683
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:19,108
Jeannie... Jeannie, I'm a nice guy.

684
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,278
Would you think that
I weigh 190 pounds? Huh?

685
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,324
You're married.

686
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,243
Oh, Jeannie, am I married.

687
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,996
Yeah, I'm married.

688
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,249
I got a son almost as old as you.

689
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:38,211
He thinks he's a grown man.

690
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,087
He goes to college.

691
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,758
I wanted him to go to one of those
Midwestern schools and play football,

692
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,301
but his mother said, "No. No football".

693
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:48,554
So he said, "All right. What the hell.
Okay, no football".

694
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:51,057
So instead he goes to Dartmouth.

695
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:53,059
Goes out for tennis instead.

696
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:56,103
All day long he walks around
in tennis shoes.

697
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,022
What kind of a thing is that
for a grown boy

698
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:00,858
to walk around in tennis shoes
all day long?

699
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,610
What the hell. He's my son.

700
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:05,947
Even if he wants to nance around,
I say, "So what?"

701
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,116
Everybody's gotta Iead
their own life, right?

702
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:13,120
So, he goes out for swimming and track,

703
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,959
and wears tennis shoes.

704
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:26,968
Jeannie, do you know what it is to be
a promo man in a firm like mine, huh?

705
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,803
I'll tell ya.

706
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,889
You meet more millionaires
and more presidents

707
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,141
than you dream could exist.

708
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,937
And that seems like
a big thing to you, huh?

709
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,318
So, what have I got
after all those years?

710
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,155
A big house, a kooky wife
and a kid who wears sneakers.

711
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:16,475
Hey, Jeannie baby!
Hey. You're all right, Jeannie baby!

712
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,730
Whoo!

713
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,316
Hey. Turn out these lights, will ya?

714
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,943
Looks like an office in here.

715
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:28,029
How do you expect to make out
with all these lights on?

716
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:30,573
What do you say, Slick?

717
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:39,957
Hey. You know what?
You've got quite a tummy.

718
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,834
You've got... Hasn't he got a... Huh?

719
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:44,003
Hey, how about a little kiss
for my buddy?

720
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,796
How about a... Ooh!

721
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,593
JEANNIE: Stay. Have a good time.
Stella, lock up when you go.

722
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:52,261
Wait a minute. Where you goin'? Hold on!

723
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,972
-Leave me alone.
-Will you leave her alone!

724
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,933
Just get out of here!

725
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,362
Now, what are you makin'
a scene for? Huh?

726
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:13,115
-Come on. Give me a break.
-Give you a break?

727
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,952
Why? You think you deserve a break?

728
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:20,831
-Look, I met this guy.
-You met this guy. So?

729
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:23,542
-STELLA: Leave her alone.
-Ah, shut up! Will you sit down?

730
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,171
So you met this guy. Go ahead.
So you met this guy. What about him?

731
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,090
You in love with this guy?
You hate this guy?

732
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,758
-You went to college with this guy?
-No.

733
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,095
Come on. Don't do this. Don't.

734
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,350
All right. Come on, will ya?

735
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:41,102
Cut it out.

736
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,404
You son of a bitch!

737
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:59,704
JACKSON: There's this joke
about the Siamese twins.

738
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,247
What?

739
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,500
Have you ever heard
that old belly-twister, uh,

740
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,420
about the Siamese twins?

741
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,255
- No.

742
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,842
One is named June and the other July.

743
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,678
-Is that a real one?
-Oh, no, no, no.

744
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:17,888
Let me light that for you.

745
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:20,766
Thank you.

746
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,394
Oh, boy, women.

747
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:26,355
If I live to be a million,
I'll never understand 'em.

748
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,898
Crazy broads.

749
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,568
Aw, shoot, now.

750
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:32,278
Come on over here, huh?

751
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,197
Come on. Will ya?

752
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,866
Come on.

753
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,785
Come on, you son of a gun.

754
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,872
Come on, now. Come on.

755
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:45,082
Come on. Ooh, you.

756
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:48,294
Come on!

757
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,879
You know you're nuts?

758
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:52,965
- You know that, don't you?

759
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:11,817
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Don't go away.

760
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,278
Come on in. Join the party.

761
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,614
There's been a lot of controversy
over you tonight.

762
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,824
Oh, no, there hasn't been
any controversy.

763
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,326
Sure there has.

764
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,661
-You're the one in the bar, right?
-That's right.

765
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,164
-Been waitin' a couple of hours?
-That's right.

766
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:26,999
Well, then, come on, take your coat off.

767
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,584
-Relax, join the party.
-Hey, stop that.

768
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,169
Okay. Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

769
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,922
We'll just have a couple drinks,
then we'll get out of here, huh?

770
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:34,840
You don't mind, do ya?

771
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:38,302
-What's your name, by the way?
-Richard.

772
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,430
JIM: Well, Richard, Richard.
Atta boy. That's a nice name, Richard.

773
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:45,851
Isn't that a nice name, Jackson?
Hey, Richard. Richard. Richard!

774
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,145
I'm talkin' to you, boy.
Come on. Pay attention. Let's go.

775
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:51,524
I'm Jim, that's Joe and, uh,
Stella I suppose you know.

776
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,527
JACKSON: Hey, what do you do, Richard?

777
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,821
I'm a businessman.

778
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:59,365
-Insurance, huh?
-That's right.

779
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,202
At least he's not a fag,
huh, Jeannie?

780
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,540
- Well, maybe I am.

781
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:10,042
The boy Richard is all right.
Your friend Richard...

782
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:12,795
JACKSON: He's got spirit,
hasn't he, Jim?

783
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,713
Listen, now that we're through
with basic training,

784
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:18,217
can we knock off the grade school
theatrics? Jeannie, I...

785
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,554
# I used to work in Chicago
in a department store

786
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:25,224
# I used to work in Chicago
I do but I don't any more

787
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,519
# A lady came in, she asked for a whoop
What kind of whoop said I

788
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:32,731
# Whoop she said, whoop I said
I did but I don't any more #

789
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:37,820
Richard, you don't know
a goddamn thing about women, do ya?

790
00:52:37,904 --> 00:52:40,573
You know that women are basically
all whores? Did you know that?

791
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:42,074
Ooh!

792
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:46,036
I'm sorry.

793
00:52:48,915 --> 00:52:51,000
JIM: Excuse me, Jeannie.

794
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,755
You're married, right?
Wouldn't you say he's married, Jackson?

795
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:59,008
-Oh, yeah, he's married.
-Very much so.

796
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,843
JACKSON: Forty-eight, unhappy as hell.

797
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,763
Uh-huh. Separated, out for a good time.
Out for a good time!

798
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,892
Lookin' for a little
momentary relationship.

799
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,770
Who the hell are you guys?

800
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,941
Oh, didn't we tell ya, Richard?
We're the police.

801
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,444
-Oh, yeah, we're the vice squad.
-Vice squad!

802
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,738
STELLA: They're not.
They're just kidding.

803
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:26,368
So, look, you run along home, sonny boy,
and play with your own.

804
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:31,540
STELLA: Joe is Joe Jackson.
Jim is Jim McCarthy.

805
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:34,210
He's vice president of Metal...

806
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:38,631
JACKSON: Industries of the Pacific
West Coast and affiliate companies.

807
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:40,216
JIM: Jackson's supposed
to mix the drinks, right?

808
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,134
-Right.
-Jackson.

809
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,803
-Get me a double-double scotch.
-Straight?

810
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:48,057
-No soda and no ice.
-No soda, no ice.

811
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:51,143
Neat, clean,
straight down the line, huh?

812
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,147
Dickie, why don't you go?

813
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,985
What do I do now?

814
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,779
Take my coat off?

815
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:05,658
What you want me to do?
Take my coat off? All right.

816
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,911
-All right. Step outside.
-No.

817
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,079
What do you mean, "No"?

818
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,997
If you think I'm gonna fight
in the dark, you're crazy.

819
00:54:12,123 --> 00:54:13,999
-We can't fight in Miss Rapp's house.
-Why not?

820
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,835
Why not? Look, McCarthy,
why don't you just get out of here?

821
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,587
Nobody wants you around.

822
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:20,756
-Oh, nobody wants me around, huh?
-Right.

823
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,968
A little whiIe ago, you almost fainted
when I offered you 200 bucks.

824
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,594
-Oh!
-Two hundred bucks. Who needs ya!

825
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,137
You're not even pretty!

826
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,848
-I hope he knocks you on your fat prat!
-FORST: Take it easy, Jeannie.

827
00:54:29,975 --> 00:54:31,934
-You wanna fight or not?
-You wanna go through with it?

828
00:54:32,018 --> 00:54:33,852
What are you, yellow?

829
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:41,193
Oh, now you did it! Now you did it!

830
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:44,029
Now your head's gonna leave your body.

831
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:46,532
-Hey, do you need any help, boss?
-No!

832
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,993
No! No, I don't need any help!

833
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:52,621
No!

834
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,881
JIM: Ooh, you wanna fight dirty, eh?

835
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:05,634
-Hey, hey, hey.
-I'll kill him. Oh, my knee!

836
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,554
My knee. I'll kill ya.
Ooh, my knee, my knee!

837
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:11,890
-You shouldn't have done it so long.
-I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

838
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:15,060
-All right. Come on.
-JIM: Get out of my way!

839
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:19,565
Come on. Will you go on? Come on, boy.

840
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,901
I'll kill him. Oh, my knee, my knee.
Take it easy, will ya?

841
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:26,071
Ow! God! I'll kill that bum.

842
00:55:26,197 --> 00:55:28,073
I'll take him apart
and put him together again!

843
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:29,658
Yes, sir. Look, just a minute.

844
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,410
For crying out loud,
I know you'll kill him.

845
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,707
What's the matter with you?
Listen, I've taken guys twice his size.

846
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,334
I'll bet you have.

847
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,669
I had a 300-pound wrestler one time,
gave me some gaff.

848
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,839
I picked him up over my head, threw him
to the ground. I broke his collarbone!

849
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,425
You son of a gun.

850
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,098
-You don't believe me, huh?
-Oh, sure I do.

851
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,441
-How did we get into this?
-How did we get into it?

852
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:04,360
How the hell do we get out of it?

853
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,366
You son of a...

854
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,872
Ah, shoot. You look fine.

855
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,625
Now, take it easy, will ya?

856
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,587
Okay. But one word
out of him, and I'll...

857
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,383
You son of a gun!

858
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,303
All right. Come on. Let's go.

859
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:35,307
I said,
"I used to do a little bit of, uh...

860
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:37,601
"A little bit of fighting."

861
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:03,377
I understand you're a pretty big
businessman. Is that right, Jim?

862
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,962
JIM: Yeah, that's right.

863
00:57:05,004 --> 00:57:07,631
Stella tells me you're
in advertising and promotion.

864
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,174
Yeah, that's my title.

865
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,886
They think I'm worth $150,000 a year
plus expenses for it.

866
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:15,556
Ah. Who's your biggest account?

867
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:18,684
He doesn't believe me.

868
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:21,186
-Hey, look. Here's a card.
-I'm not interested.

869
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:25,357
-No, he's not interested in that.
-You buy, uh, brass and aluminium?

870
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:29,027
Yep. I buy brass and aluminium.

871
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,989
-Is that right?
-That's right. Case closed.

872
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,867
Hey. Hey, now. Look, you son of a gun.

873
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:36,535
You told me in the kitchen.

874
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,706
Okay.

875
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:52,217
JIM: Hey, uh, you ever hear the one
about the fag motorcycle driver?

876
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:54,428
FORST: Yeah, I heard that.

877
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,849
Well, how about the one about
the little Jewish agent who...

878
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,226
"Not necessarily."
I heard that one, too.

879
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,896
Hey, why don't you tell him
about that one about "probably"...

880
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:06,398
Oh, come on, now.
You gave the punch line away.

881
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,859
-What's the matter with you?
-I heard that one.

882
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,736
-How about the goose one?
-The goose one?

883
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:15,199
Yeah. The goose that goes down
the subway and gets peopled to death.

884
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:18,785
The goose that goes down the subway
and gets peopled to death.

885
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,915
JIM: Oh, you're too much. Oh, boy!

886
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,875
Hey, did you hear the one about

887
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,919
the little Jewish carpenter
who was so mean...

888
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,129
Once a schmuck, always a schmuck.

889
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,300
That's not the ending I heard.

890
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,220
That joke's old enough to have a beard.

891
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,224
You're really uncanny.

892
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,059
Oh, boy.

893
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:45,604
Hey, you said you were in business.
What kind, uh...

894
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:47,231
He said he was in insurance business.

895
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,483
Well, I'm in finance.
That's a form of insurance.

896
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,276
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

897
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:54,071
-What do you do there?
-I'm chairman of the board.

898
00:58:54,113 --> 00:58:57,157
-We have one corporation.
-Yeah? What's the firm?

899
00:58:57,283 --> 00:59:00,160
- Investment Finance.
- That's a pretty big outfit.

900
00:59:00,286 --> 00:59:03,664
-Yeah.
-Hey, uh, do you know Stewie Ray?

901
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,793
JACKSON: He's not kidding.
JIM: I'm not making it up. Stewie Ray.

902
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:09,628
-Works for me.
-JIM: No kidding? Really?

903
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,589
-Yeah.
-He's a nice guy. Hell of a nice guy.

904
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:15,133
-You do business with him?
-Ah, we talk once in a whiIe.

905
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,970
A firm like mine has to have
a good credit rate. We talk.

906
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,930
-That's very good.
-Yeah.

907
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:23,308
Enough of business already.
I'm getting hungry.

908
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:25,686
You been to Chicago, Dick?

909
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:28,939
-Not often.
-There he goes. He's...

910
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:31,984
He's uncanny with this phraseology,
you know that?

911
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,819
No wonder you're chairman of the board.

912
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,821
Jeannie, you know what
chairman of the board is?

913
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:40,284
He's the man. He's a killer.
Boy, he's got all the weight.

914
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:42,953
Did you ever tell Jean
about the board of directors' meeting?

915
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,789
I was just about to,
but I didn't get the chance somehow.

916
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:51,962
There he goes with that
uncanny phraseology of his again.

917
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:55,716
Boy, I'll bet you're a real murderer
behind that big desk of yours.

918
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,176
Well, I don't have a big desk.

919
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,848
You know, you're all right.
You're all right. You know...

920
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:05,392
I've been a...
I've been a road man all my life.

921
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:08,395
I've been in every toilet in 50 states.

922
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,982
I sort of prefer it that way.
Hey, do you know the...

923
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:20,532
JIM: Hey, you know what?
Before they had planes, they had trains.

924
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:23,327
Now they got these planes that fly
 like that.

925
01:00:23,369 --> 01:00:26,705
Four and a half hours
from New York to Los Angeles.

926
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,248
Four and a half hours. You believe that?

927
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:32,169
-I don't wanna talk about business.
-Huh?

928
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:35,547
I don't wanna either.
I'd rather play a game of billiards.

929
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:37,049
Do you play billiards?

930
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:41,011
I can tell by your expression you don't.
I'll bet you're a golf man, right?

931
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,848
-Tennis.
-Tennis. My kid plays tennis, too.

932
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,725
Is that right? Tennis? No kidding.

933
01:00:46,768 --> 01:00:49,061
I got a friend of mine who bought
Don Budge's house.

934
01:00:49,103 --> 01:00:53,065
I know those guys.
You know, Segura, Kramer, uh, Gonzales.

935
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,733
I only play for myself.

936
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,235
JIM: Sure. Go down,
play a few sets, work off the gut.

937
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,447
That'll keep your mind...
Uh, body up with your mind.

938
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,032
I got a kid who plays, too.

939
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,242
He's a hell of a nice kid.
Smart as a whip, too.

940
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,746
-Nothing like his old man.
-Why you S.O.B.

941
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:11,583
-You're right. I am an S.O.B.
-You are.

942
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:15,754
Oh, boy. This kid's fantastic.
He runs! He runs!

943
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:20,092
And he runs for hours and hours.
Summer, winter, snowing, rain.

944
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:23,095
He doesn't care.
He swims in any kind of weather.

945
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,390
Oh, boy. I'm tellin' ya, I don't know
where these kids get the energy.

946
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:27,933
You ever see these Ivy League kids?

947
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,602
They all look alike,
skinny shoulders, sneakers.

948
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,729
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

949
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,944
Oh, I don't know either.

950
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:41,154
-Hey. Hey.
-What?

951
01:01:41,906 --> 01:01:46,576
I think that Dickie would like
to be alone with the young lady.

952
01:01:49,622 --> 01:01:52,624
Oh, sure. Who wouldn't?
I would, too. You kidding?

953
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,668
A couple of visiting firemen come in,
cramp your style,

954
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,628
step all over your feet, huh?

955
01:01:56,754 --> 01:01:59,297
Listen, McCarthy,
if you don't get out of here,

956
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,675
I'm gonna call the vice squad.

957
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:05,762
-Hey, remember. We're the vice squad!
-You're the vice squad!

958
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:09,182
Okay. Hey, Stella, why don't you
give that girl... What's her name?

959
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:11,184
-Marta.
-Marta. Why don't you give her a call?

960
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,770
Now, come on, sweetheart? All right?
Then we can get out of here. Okay?

961
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:18,024
Oh, gee, Dick, how did we get
into this situation anyway?

962
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:20,819
I'm sorry. It's ridiculous, isn't it?

963
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:22,988
Why don't I give you a call Monday?

964
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:26,324
Maybe we can have lunch or, uh,
maybe just talk on the phone, all right?

965
01:02:26,367 --> 01:02:30,120
-That's a very good idea.
-Good. Okay. Stewie Ray.

966
01:02:32,206 --> 01:02:34,791
Ah. Oh, boy.

967
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,169
Ah, Stewie Ray. Hey, come on.

968
01:02:37,295 --> 01:02:39,463
Oh, Jeannie, I'll call you
the next time I get in town.

969
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,465
Yes, yes, you do that.

970
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,967
JIM: Come on, Stella.
Let's go. Shake it up!

971
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,011
-It's been a real pleasure.
-Nice meeting you.

972
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,804
-Richard, old boy.
-Jim.

973
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,973
-Nice meeting you.
-Right.

974
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:53,977
-Sorry about what happened.
-Well, that's the way it goes.

975
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:56,062
-Night.
-Joey.

976
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,648
JACKSON: It's really been a pleasure.

977
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:02,360
- You're gonna get a raise, Joey.
- I hope so.

978
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:05,238
JIM: Come on, Stella, step it up,
will ya? Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

979
01:03:05,364 --> 01:03:07,866
I'm glad she's not too tired.
I gotta get my coat. Wait.

980
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:09,868
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

981
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,704
-Wait till I get...
-STELLA: It's cold outside.

982
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,247
-Come on.
-STELLA: Good night, Jeannie.

983
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,041
JEANNIE: Thanks. See you later.

984
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,960
Good night again. Good night, Miss Rapp.

985
01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:21,379
JIM: Dickie, Stewie Ray, huh?

986
01:03:22,256 --> 01:03:24,257
Stewie Ray!

987
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:30,722
- I thought they'd never leave.

988
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:33,600
"Stewie Ray."

989
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:38,063
-"You're a golf man, right, Richard?"
-Tennis.

990
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:42,442
I never laughed so hard.

991
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,653
I was pretty good, wasn't I?

992
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:47,405
-My hero.
-Hi, ho, Silver!

993
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,949
Shh!

994
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,078
White horse hero. You get it?

995
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,247
Yeah, I get it.

996
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,007
Ah, Dickie, Dickie, Dickie.

997
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,593
I like you, you know.
I really do like ya.

998
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,595
-Well, don't get serious.
-I'm not.

999
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,597
-Well, don't.
-I wasn't.

1000
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,599
Definition of "seriousness".

1001
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:18,186
Noun. Grave or solemn of disposition.

1002
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:22,816
Yeah, well, I wasn't getting serious.
I'm your friend.

1003
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,819
Well, you know how
I feel about friendship.

1004
01:04:25,945 --> 01:04:28,613
-No. How do you feel?
-Definition of "friendship".

1005
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:31,658
Noun. One who's attached to another

1006
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,786
because of their personal regard.

1007

Companion, a comrade, a chum,

1008
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,834
and someone who doesn't get serious.

01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:43,461
-Friends never get serious?
-Never.

1010
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,673
-Can a friend ask a question?
-No. And shut up.

1011
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,969
Let's do Peter Piper
picked a pickle... Peck a...

1012
01:04:51,012 --> 01:04:54,180
-Ah, Dickie, I'm exhausted.
-You can't be exhausted.

1013
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:56,141
Peter Piper picked a peck of peckled...

1014
01:04:56,183 --> 01:04:57,475
Peter Piper picked a peck of...

1015
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:00,395
Hey, Dickie, why did you want to see me?

1016
01:05:01,522 --> 01:05:03,732
I wanted to play with you.

1017
01:05:03,816 --> 01:05:05,692
All right. Then what?

1018
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,486
Oh, we'd play, have a few laughs,

1019
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:10,363
see what developed.

1020
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,824
-I like you.
-You like me.

1021
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:15,911
-I like you.
-All right, you like me.

1022
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,831
-That's right. I like you.
-Oh, Dickie, what's the matter?

1023
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,002
You think I'm one of
those gross businessmen?

1024
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:26,004
You think I have a secretary
that picks up the phone

1025
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:28,256
and gets me whatever I want?

1026
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,884
Jeannie, I buried eight relatives
in the past six years.

1027
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:33,595
There's nobody left but me.
I'm just a mild success

1028
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:36,014
in a dull profession,
and I wanna start over again.

1029
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,849
And I've got a bad kidney!

1030
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,188
So?

1031
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:55,700
Come on and take a bath.

1032
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,412
I don't want a bath!

1033
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:08,922
No bath?

1034
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,715
No bath.

1035
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,884
People drown in bathtubs.

1036
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:33,571
No hard feelings?

1037
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:36,157
You're aces high with me, Charlie.

1038
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:39,911
# I dream of Jeannie

1039
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,289
# With the light brown hair

1040
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:47,961
# Borne like a vapour on the summer air

1041
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,022
You know, you're a very strange man.

1042
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:11,026
-Well, you want me to leave, I'll leave.
-But not sensitive.

1043
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,279
And another thing,
you don't make me insecure.

1044
01:07:15,114 --> 01:07:17,782
-That's not one of my problems.
-Good.

1045
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,161
Alrighty.

1046
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,830
Now.

1047
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:27,792
Okay, give me a foot.

1048
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,629
--Those are new socks.

1049
01:07:32,631 --> 01:07:34,049
Yeah? Good.

1050
01:07:34,675 --> 01:07:37,635
- Yeah, new socks make me insecure.

1051
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,306
Clothes make the man.

1052
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:46,019
-What does that do?
-Makes your feet smell good.

1053
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,979
Oh, that's fine.

1054
01:07:48,522 --> 01:07:51,232
Then I'm gonna dry them off,
I'm gonna powder them down,

1055
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,234
and then I'm gonna rub 'em till warm.

1056
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,653
# Oh, dem bones, dem bones
They walk all over

1057
01:07:55,738 --> 01:07:57,030
# Dem bones, dem bones
# Dem bones, dem bones

1058
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:58,239
# They walk all over
# Dry bones

1059
01:07:58,324 --> 01:08:00,158
# Dem bones, dem bones
# Dem bones, dem bones, dry bones

1060
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,327
# Now hear the word of the Lord

1061
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,245
# Dem bones, dem bones
# Now the backbone

1062
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:07,832
# Oh, dem bones, dem bones
They walk all over

1063
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,168
# Dem bones, dem bones
gonna walk around #

1064
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,170
-I trust you.
-What?

1065
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:15,882
I said... I said I trust you.

1066
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:17,425
Good.

1067
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,930
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

1068
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:32,524
Oh, Freddie.

1069
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:38,530
Jeannie. Hey, Jeannie.

1070
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:40,782
Jeannie, you wanna hear a secret, huh?

1071
01:08:45,037 --> 01:08:49,707
Oh, Jeannie, I don't give a damn
about racial, religious,

1072
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,627
moral, economical, political problems.

1073
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:55,964
-That makes two of us.
-Eating meat disturbs me.

1074
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:01,094
Right. Can you imagine raising
poor little chickens, steers and lambs

1075
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,720
to fill our tummies?

1076
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,889
Now, there's a problem and nobody cares.

1077
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:06,558
Right.

1078
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,434
-Right? Huh? Right?
-Right.

1079
01:09:08,561 --> 01:09:11,729
They take all the wool off the lamb,
and then we eat it.

1080
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:12,939
Oh, Dickie.

1081
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:17,068
What is all this holier-than-thou crap
that they hand us?

1082
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:20,947
You know what I think?
I think we were all created evil!

1083
01:09:21,073 --> 01:09:25,451
Then some wise guy...
Some, uh... A left-winger or a...

1084
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:29,789
A union organiser comes along and
tells us that we all were created good.

1085
01:09:29,915 --> 01:09:32,917
We were all created in His image. Right?

1086
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:37,130
- Wrong.

1087
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:40,675
Hey, Jeannie. Jeannie, come here.

1088
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:44,470
Now, I'm gonna tell you something.
This is serious.

1089
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:48,349
You're such a lovely girl, Jeannie,

1090
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,351
but you talk too much.

1091
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:53,771
I talk too much?

1092
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,399
Didn't anybody ever tell you that?

1093
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,526
You talk too much.

1094
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,572
-I..?
-Now turn out the lights.

1095
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:45,198
I'm spending the night.

1096
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,126
You're a son of a bitch.
Do you know that?

1097
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:59,504
Why am I a son of a bitch?

1098
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:01,047
Because you get to me.

1099
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,175
And anybody that gets to me...

1100
01:11:07,805 --> 01:11:09,347
You kill me.

1101
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,349
Let's have some music.

1102
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,943
MAN: # Ow!

1103
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,404
# I said everybody

1104
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,616
# Throw up your hands now

1105
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:24,774
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1106
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,495
# I heard of skate-a-ling

1107
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,955
# Skate-a-ling

1108
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:14,008
# Skate-a-ling, skate-a-ling

1109
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:17,470
# Skate-a-ling, oh!

1110
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,582
# Ow!

1111
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:49,043
# I said everybody

1112
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:52,213
# Throw up your hands now

1113
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:25,329
# Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah#

1114
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:28,684
Here we are.

1115
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:34,982
Come on!

1116
01:17:35,442 --> 01:17:37,902
Well, come on. Here's the living room.

1117
01:17:37,986 --> 01:17:40,488
Come on.

1118
01:17:44,618 --> 01:17:46,285
Ooh! Oh!

1119
01:18:38,588 --> 01:18:40,464
Oh, oh, Chet.

1120
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,759
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1121
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:48,013
# You know, life's so funny, baby

1122
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:51,475
# Don't even know where I'm gonna run

1123
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,232
# You know, life's so funny, baby

1124
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:02,945
# Don't even know where I'm gonna run

1125
01:19:05,866 --> 01:19:08,951
# You're still such a little darlin'

1126
01:19:09,578 --> 01:19:11,287
# Expect so much#

1127
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:13,456
Leave her alone now, and stop it!

1128
01:19:13,540 --> 01:19:15,708
-Come and sit down.
-Hey.

1129
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,710
Let's just sit down!

1130
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,269
It's a nice place you got here.

1131
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,065
Thank you. It's 27 years old.

1132
01:19:40,150 --> 01:19:42,651
-Twenty-seven years old?
-Oh, come on, Chettie!

1133
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,988
Let's do some more
twistin' and groovin'.

1134
01:19:46,072 --> 01:19:47,948
-Florence, the party's over.
-Come on, Florence.

1135
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,493
Oh, no. The party's just beginning.

1136
01:19:50,577 --> 01:19:52,745
-Right, Chettie?
-Uh, yeah, right.

1137
01:19:52,829 --> 01:19:55,414
'Cause I'm mixing the drinkies.

1138
01:19:55,499 --> 01:19:57,416
Ladies, declare!

1139
01:19:57,501 --> 01:19:59,627
-Gin and tonic.
-Scotch and soda.

1140
01:19:59,711 --> 01:20:02,379
Two glasses comin' up. Oh!

1141
01:20:08,428 --> 01:20:10,554
Look, I got these records.

1142
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:12,932
Can we have some music, please?

1143
01:20:17,979 --> 01:20:20,731
Can we have some music or something,
or are we just gonna sit here?

1144
01:20:21,900 --> 01:20:23,984
Where are you from, Chet?

1145
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:26,278
Detroit.

1146
01:20:30,408 --> 01:20:31,867
Do you like Los Angeles?

1147
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:35,412
Do you?

1148
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:38,582
Well, I like the climate.

1149
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,043
I do, too.

1150
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:54,765
Well! Well, wasn't that
some place tonight, huh?

1151
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:59,520
And those dances.
The, uh, Watusi and the Frug.

1152
01:20:59,604 --> 01:21:02,898
-CHET: Oh, yeah.
-And the Dog and the Jerk.

1153
01:21:02,941 --> 01:21:04,942
-CHET: And the...
-Did you like it?

1154
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,027
With all those young boys?
Of course I liked it.

1155
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,571
CHET: Yeah.

1156
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:13,200
-Yeah.
-Of course I liked it.

1157
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:16,412
I did notice that you handled yourself
very well at the A-Go-Go.

1158
01:21:16,454 --> 01:21:18,747
Oh! Well, thank you.

1159
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,960
You're definitely an individual type.

1160
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,881
I mean, you don't seem to succumb
to the atmosphere.

1161
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,966
Who was the little bIonde girl

1162
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:32,636
with the big blue eyes
and the big bazoom?

1163
01:21:34,097 --> 01:21:38,809
And did you notice the one
in the black tights with the boots?

1164
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,395
LOUISE: You have to have
the figure for those tights.

1165
01:21:41,479 --> 01:21:43,480
I have never had any complaints, Louise.

1166
01:21:43,607 --> 01:21:45,733
Billie-May, I didn't say
anything like that.

1167
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,324
You...

1168
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:05,169
Come on, now, you guys. I mean,

01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:10,674
Believe me, will ya?

01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:23,520
You people are too much, man. Look...

01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:24,855
Are you kiddin'?

1173
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:27,524
Well, out of that whole room
full of pretty, young chicks,

1174
01:22:27,651 --> 01:22:30,361
what made you come over to our table?

1175
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:32,780
Oh, Billie-May, you know why?

1176
01:22:32,864 --> 01:22:35,658
Because there was
something wrong with ya.

1177
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,994
You guys were all
sitting there like a bunch of...

1178
01:22:39,037 --> 01:22:42,206
Well, like you were gonna
break into tears any minute.

1179
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,542
Now, if I see someone trying to join in

1180
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,295
and not knowing how,

1181
01:22:49,047 --> 01:22:51,215
if I myself know how

1182
01:22:51,341 --> 01:22:54,510
and always make it a point
to know how with anybody,

1183
01:22:54,552 --> 01:22:56,220
and I say, "Go on over, man".

1184
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:58,847
Kind of like, uh, Jesus said. You know.

1185
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:01,725
# Jesus said la, dee, da

1186
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:04,687
# God is love, love is dead #

1187
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:08,816
Kind of like Christ said, you know.
HeIp thy neighbour, man.

1188
01:23:08,900 --> 01:23:11,235
-Is he the one that said that?
-LOUISE: Billie-May,

1189
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:14,029
what difference does it make
who said it?

1190
01:23:14,906 --> 01:23:16,991
CHET: What difference does it make
who said it?

1191
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,410
It could have been, uh...

1192
01:23:19,536 --> 01:23:20,995
It could have been Him.

1193
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:23,747
It could have been Gandhi.
It could have been Buddha.

1194
01:23:23,873 --> 01:23:26,500
It could have been spoodah.
It could have been your daddy.

1195
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:29,503
It could have been your mama.
It could have been your uh-uh.

1196
01:23:29,587 --> 01:23:31,088
Could have been your huh-huh.

1197
01:23:31,172 --> 01:23:34,675
What difference, man?

1198
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:40,514
Hey, listen, man. It's a very good way
to express yourself.

1199
01:23:41,182 --> 01:23:42,599
BILLIE-MAY: What do you mean?

1200
01:23:43,727 --> 01:23:45,185
What?

1201
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,438
I said, "What do you mean?"

1202
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,608
Well, I said, like, take a guy my age.

1203
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,362
I gotta have some kind of a release.

1204
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,364
Now, do you wanna...

1205
01:23:57,449 --> 01:24:00,075
Well, I can't very well
hold up a bank for kicks.

1206
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,536
-That's against the law, right?
-LOUISE: Right.

1207
01:24:02,620 --> 01:24:06,582
-FLORENCE: Right, Chettie.
-Then everybody agrees with me.

1208
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:10,461
-Christ. So what do you do?
-LOUISE: You dance.

1209
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:13,714
-You dance.
-BILLIE-MAY: You dance.

1210
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:18,052
You have a few belts and go up
to some chick's pad and make it, baby.

1211
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:20,554
Make it?

1212
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:26,060
Just make it, baby.
You out-and-out lay down and...

1213
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:33,442
And I...

1214
01:24:39,574 --> 01:24:42,659
Or you can sit around,
have a drag and, uh,

1215
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,621
think about what's wrong
and all, you know?

1216
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:47,831
Oh, I know what you mean.

1217
01:24:50,293 --> 01:24:52,795
-I think you do.
-BILLIE-MAY: Oh, sure she does.

1218
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,505
Sure she does.

1219
01:25:10,605 --> 01:25:12,481
-BILLIE-MAY: Well!
-Well!

1220
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:14,024
Aaah!

1221
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:21,365
FLORENCE: Yeah, boy.

1222
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:25,536
BILLIE-MAY: Well, Louise, Maria,
Florence, there it is.

1223
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,204
This is it.

1224
01:25:27,330 --> 01:25:30,207
The, uh, new generation.
The one our husbands...

1225
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:33,210
CHET:  That's fun...

1226
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,839
That's funny as hell.

1227
01:25:37,882 --> 01:25:42,553
Billie-May, how'd you happen to get
on the subject of our husbands again?

1228
01:25:46,975 --> 01:25:49,226
Well... Oh...

1229
01:25:51,229 --> 01:25:55,357
Because they're scared.
They're scared men. I mean...

1230
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,736
Well, they're...

1231
01:26:01,698 --> 01:26:03,574
They're scared of you.

1232
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:08,078
They're scared of you. They're, uh...

1233
01:26:08,121 --> 01:26:09,705
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

1234
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:12,207
They are scared of your youth,

1235
01:26:14,085 --> 01:26:17,087
and your spirit,

1236
01:26:18,423 --> 01:26:20,465
and your build.

1237
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:25,137
They think that they
are the kings of the earth

1238
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:29,308
and they do not want you
takin' their place, see?

1239
01:26:41,070 --> 01:26:43,780
Well, I don't want it. I mean, not...

1240
01:26:47,410 --> 01:26:49,995
Well, I just don't want the hang-up.

1241
01:26:58,254 --> 01:26:59,922
Chettie!

1242
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:03,634
You're a damn good-looking kid
for only 23.

1243
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:05,594
-Florence.
-Let's dance.

1244
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:09,264
# Florence from Torrance
She's got the insurance

1245
01:27:09,307 --> 01:27:12,809
# Florence from Torrance
The men all want Florence

1246
01:27:12,936 --> 01:27:16,271
# The happiest chick that I ever did see

1247
01:27:16,314 --> 01:27:19,524
# Until I met a girl named Billie-May

1248
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:23,320
# Come on, Billie-May
I want it your way

1249
01:27:23,446 --> 01:27:27,449
# Come on, Billie-May
Make it any day

1250
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:31,370
# Come on, Billie-May
I wanna do the thing

1251
01:27:31,496 --> 01:27:35,374
# Do the little bell, babe
Turn me on like hell, babe

1252
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:40,003
# Come on, Billie-May
Hit the ray, you and me, Billie-May

1253
01:27:40,046 --> 01:27:43,548
# Come on, now
You will see everything for you and me

1254
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:46,677
# We will do all the things
that we did before, my dear

1255
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:50,722
# Florence from Torrance

1256
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:54,351
# The hot-headed Florence
Just what they can't see

1257
01:27:54,394 --> 01:27:57,646
# The girl named Florence
is groovy, you see

1258
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,066
# But all they want to do
is spend her money

1259
01:28:01,192 --> 01:28:06,029
# 'Cause she's got the insurance
The girl from Torrance, Florence

1260
01:28:06,072 --> 01:28:09,533
# Send all her allowance
Florence from Torrance #

1261
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:20,585
-No.
-Come on.

1262
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:23,213
-No.
-Come on. It's easy.

1263
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:26,675
-No. No, Chet. I don't wanna.
-Right shoe.

1264
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:29,011
Right shoe. Yeah, baby.
Put it right there.

1265
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:30,762
-No.
-Come on.

1266
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:36,435
# Put on the red meat, baby
I want the red meat, baby

1267
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,354
# I like the rare meat, baby

1268
01:28:39,397 --> 01:28:43,900
# Don't want no seasonin', baby
No taters or no onions

1269
01:28:44,027 --> 01:28:46,236
# All I wanna do is tonion

1270
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,572
- Come on. That's it.

1271
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:51,116
-Where are you... Come here.
-No.

1272
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:52,701
Right here, baby. It's easy.

1273
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:55,412
# I need your red meat, baby

1274
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:58,415
# It grooves me like
your white meat, baby

1275
01:28:59,250 --> 01:29:02,878
# Put it in the oven
Want it big and round

1276
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,089
# Put it in the oven
Eat it off the ground

1277
01:29:06,215 --> 01:29:08,717
# Come on and do the slip and slide

1278
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,761
# I ain't had no goodies
since your granny died

1279
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:14,431
# Put on the red meat, baby

1280
01:29:14,474 --> 01:29:16,558
# Don't want no taters or onions

1281
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:18,143
# I just want a tonion

1282
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:21,438
# Come on and put on the red, baby

1283
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:26,401
Come on.

1284
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:28,945
# I like the red meat, baby#

1285
01:29:29,489 --> 01:29:32,491
Oh, I think we're makin'
fools of ourselves.

1286
01:29:33,951 --> 01:29:36,244
-What?
-Yeah.

1287
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:39,122
I'm making a fool of myself?

1288
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:40,999
Well, we are. Yeah.

1289
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:46,004
-Well, who are you to criticise me?
-I'm not criticising. I'm just saying...

1290
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:48,632
You don't have to tell me
I'm making a fool of myself.

1291
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:52,469
Look, I know how to dance my way.

1292
01:29:52,512 --> 01:29:54,805
I don't need you to tell me about it.

1293
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,473
I come from a musical background.

1294
01:29:56,599 --> 01:29:58,767
-I take care of a family of five.
-Okay. Okay.

1295
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,477
I have a college degree,

1296
01:30:00,603 --> 01:30:03,105
and I don't need you to tell me
I'm making a fool of myself.

1297
01:30:03,147 --> 01:30:05,315
-Hey. Wait a minute. I'm sorry...
-Don't touch me!

1298
01:30:18,329 --> 01:30:22,332
Chettie, you criticised her, honey.
Criticise me.

1299
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:25,961
At my age, I'm willing
to learn, honey. Please.

1300
01:30:26,879 --> 01:30:29,840
Okay, you wanna cool it
just for a moment?

1301
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:36,179
FLORENCE: # Hot-headed Florence,
she's from Torrance

1302
01:30:36,222 --> 01:30:39,891
# The insurance for Chettie-boy

1303
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:44,729
# Oh, Billie-May
She makes love in the hay

1304
01:30:46,190 --> 01:30:49,025
# Hot-headed Florence

1305
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:54,030
# She's from Torrance
with all the insurance

1306
01:30:54,407 --> 01:30:59,244
# Hot-headed Florence
Zoom, zoom, da-ditty

1307
01:31:01,831 --> 01:31:06,668
# Oh, Maria
You can't see Maria

1308
01:31:06,711 --> 01:31:11,715
# Oh, you can't talk to Maria
Oh, Maria #

1309
01:31:16,053 --> 01:31:19,973
FLORENCE: # Louise, Louise, Louise,
don't pee in the trees#

1310
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:35,238
Well.

1311
01:31:38,409 --> 01:31:42,913
Well, I think that I maintained
my dignity throughout the entire thing.

1312
01:31:43,331 --> 01:31:46,750
I mean, hell, it isn't as if
we did anything wrong.

1313
01:31:47,251 --> 01:31:50,086
All anybody has to do
is just to look at the four of us.

1314
01:31:50,129 --> 01:31:53,089
I mean, to know that there was
nothing wrong.

1315
01:31:53,132 --> 01:31:56,009
And if old Malcolm
is gonna get upset over a...

1316
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:58,136
Over a silly thing like that,
then where are we?

1317
01:31:58,262 --> 01:31:59,846
But you know Louise.

1318
01:31:59,931 --> 01:32:02,641
She is gonna go home and talk about
how vulgar it was

1319
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,686
and how terrible we all behaved and how
she went home the moment it all began.

1320
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:07,854
But I don't...

1321
01:32:07,939 --> 01:32:11,441
Well, if she does, I'm just
gonna tell her she's full of it.

1322
01:32:11,526 --> 01:32:14,361
But I don't think she will. Do you?

1323
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:17,197
I mean, not that I give a damn anyway.

1324
01:32:20,618 --> 01:32:26,540
You know, this is gonna put her
back on the couch for another 25 years.

1325
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:30,293
I'll tell you something eIse
funny, honey.

1326
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,962
I love Malcolm.

1327
01:32:32,838 --> 01:32:35,966
Yes, I am in love with my husband.

1328
01:32:37,134 --> 01:32:38,635
How about that?

1329
01:32:48,980 --> 01:32:50,689
I think he's nice.

1330
01:32:51,691 --> 01:32:53,149
Don't you?

1331
01:32:56,487 --> 01:32:58,196
You know my Louie.

1332
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:00,865
So short.

1333
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:02,826
Those awful glasses.

1334
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:08,498
And he can't carry a tune,
much less dance.

1335
01:33:11,836 --> 01:33:13,587
What's the matter?

1336
01:33:14,505 --> 01:33:16,006
Are you tired?

1337
01:33:18,843 --> 01:33:22,679
Oh, come on. Don't be tired.
The evening's young, you know.

1338
01:33:24,348 --> 01:33:27,058
You know, these dances,
these wild, crazy dances,

1339
01:33:27,184 --> 01:33:30,353
I think they've succeeded
where science failed.

1340
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,899
'Cause, you know, I can go to
a beauty parlour and sit there for hours

1341
01:33:35,026 --> 01:33:38,528
having my hair done
and my naiIs polished,

1342
01:33:39,030 --> 01:33:41,364
but I don't feel any younger.

1343
01:33:42,074 --> 01:33:43,742
I might look it.

1344
01:33:44,869 --> 01:33:48,913
But these dances,
these wild, crazy dances,

1345
01:33:49,373 --> 01:33:51,708
they do something to me inside.

1346
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:58,131
Well, to hell with Louie.

1347
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:03,553
Because do you know
one of these days I'm gonna croak?

1348
01:34:04,221 --> 01:34:07,891
And I'm gonna flop down on the ground,
and some goddamn preacher's

1349
01:34:07,933 --> 01:34:11,436
gonna preach a goddamn sermon
over my goddamn body!

1350
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,399
Oh, Chettie, Chettie, Chettie.

1351
01:34:16,442 --> 01:34:19,736
Oh! Oh, Chettie.

1352
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:25,075
Let's put on another record
and dance some more, shall we?

1353
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:27,327
Shall we?

1354
01:34:46,806 --> 01:34:49,265
Oh. Oh, Chettie.

1355
01:34:49,350 --> 01:34:51,434
I'm so exhausted.

1356
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:54,688
Oh! I'm so exhausted.

1357
01:34:56,107 --> 01:34:57,982
-I'm...
-Oh. Wait.

1358
01:35:01,278 --> 01:35:03,947
Oh, Chettie!

1359
01:35:05,449 --> 01:35:08,618
--Oh, Chettie. Chettie.

1360
01:35:09,203 --> 01:35:14,791
Oh, Chettie, you know,
I just love to dance, don't you?

1361
01:35:15,793 --> 01:35:18,336
I love ya, Flo. I just love ya.

1362
01:35:18,462 --> 01:35:21,965
Oh, you know, I could...
I could just dance...

1363
01:35:22,466 --> 01:35:24,634
Dance all night with you.

1364
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:28,805
-Oh. You know it?
-I know you could.

1365
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:04,924
Oh, that's so wonderful.

1366
01:36:05,843 --> 01:36:07,677
You're wonderful.

1367
01:36:12,892 --> 01:36:14,350
Chettie,

1368
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:20,523
would you kiss me?

1369
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:22,942
Florence. Florence.

1370
01:36:44,715 --> 01:36:46,257
FLORENCE: Mmm!

1371
01:36:56,769 --> 01:37:00,647
Chettie, will you drive me home?

1372
01:37:02,149 --> 01:37:03,608
Sure.

1373
01:37:05,069 --> 01:37:07,195
Sure. I'll drive you home.

1374
01:37:20,501 --> 01:37:23,044
Chettie! Chettie!

1375
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,088
You said you'd drive me home.

1376
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,923
I will. I will.

1377
01:37:28,008 --> 01:37:30,969
Maria, he is driving me home.

1378
01:37:31,053 --> 01:37:34,722
-Florence, you haven't got a car.
-Let me have your car.

1379
01:37:36,183 --> 01:37:39,769
-I will drive you home.
-I will return it tomorrow.

1380
01:37:44,108 --> 01:37:46,484
All right. Let me get the keys.

1381
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,156
I'll drive.

1382
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:03,538
You son of a...

1383
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:05,832
- MARIA:  No, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

1384
01:40:05,916 --> 01:40:08,251
-No, no, no, no, no.
-Yes, yes.

1385
01:41:51,230 --> 01:41:52,772
Let me change.

1386
01:41:54,316 --> 01:41:55,775
Okay.

1387
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:02,824
# If I find my love will I be a louse?

1388
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:06,160
# Who cares, man?
I'm gonna do it anyway

1389
01:42:06,245 --> 01:42:08,621
# Just the way I got to do it today

1390
01:42:08,705 --> 01:42:11,165
# Turn around and we'll all play

1391
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:14,210
# Pull down the spread
Pull down the covers

1392
01:42:14,294 --> 01:42:17,046
# Gonna get in and have another's

1393
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,882
# Lovers' little bed and gonna have fun

1394
01:42:19,967 --> 01:42:22,844
# Undress, baby, and we'll be one

1395
01:42:22,928 --> 01:42:25,888
# Take down your pants
Take down your drawers

1396
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:28,850
# Gonna show your daddy
what his balls are for

1397
01:42:30,686 --> 01:42:33,396
# Come on, honey, take off my socks#

1398
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:09,182
It's the lights.

1399
01:43:10,517 --> 01:43:12,351
I don't like lights.

1400
01:43:27,868 --> 01:43:30,828
Aaah!

1401
01:43:33,665 --> 01:43:36,125
Yeah, well, I'm all wet.

1402
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:39,295
You know you have a beautiful body?

1403
01:43:39,755 --> 01:43:41,964
Yeah, well...

1404
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:43,549
I've been told that, yes.

1405
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:54,435
I have been seduced.

1406
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:04,695
Is it a nice feeling?

1407
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:07,490
I am not tired, if that's what you mean.

1408
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:09,325
Eat your eggs.

1409
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:12,912
What does that mean?

1410
01:44:13,789 --> 01:44:17,750
It means that your eggs are hot,
and they're gonna get cold.

1411
01:44:23,340 --> 01:44:25,299
You're a lousy cook.

1412
01:44:25,384 --> 01:44:29,804
Thank you. I love to cook. My mom always
told me, "You wanna eat, cook.

1413
01:44:29,888 --> 01:44:31,347
"Otherwise you'll be skinny.

1414
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:34,225
"And skinny people
are not like fat people.

1415
01:44:34,309 --> 01:44:36,185
"Fat people are jolly."

1416
01:44:36,270 --> 01:44:38,312
-Right?
-Wrong.

1417
01:44:38,897 --> 01:44:42,149
Skinny people are happy
because they're not fat.

1418
01:44:42,442 --> 01:44:44,110
Okay, I'll diet.

1419
01:44:44,569 --> 01:44:46,028
You're not fat.

1420
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:50,074
-What?
-You're voluptuous.

1421
01:44:52,577 --> 01:44:54,036
What?

1422
01:44:55,414 --> 01:44:57,498
I can't hear you, Dickie.

1423
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:00,793
Oh. Dishes.

1424
01:45:31,408 --> 01:45:33,159
Well, that's a negative attitude.

1425
01:45:33,243 --> 01:45:35,369
-What? Putting on my pants?
-Yeah.

1426
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,538
Well, I just hate getting out of bed.
That's all.

1427
01:45:37,622 --> 01:45:39,874
Stop apologising. I love ya.

1428
01:45:40,375 --> 01:45:43,419
-Don't be so bighearted.
-What an answer.

1429
01:45:44,046 --> 01:45:46,922
-Well, you make lousy eggs.
-I do?

1430
01:45:47,215 --> 01:45:49,675
Yes, and I don't know how
anyone could make lousy eggs.

1431
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,511
Look, in my whole life
nobody ever told me I make lousy eggs.

1432
01:45:52,596 --> 01:45:54,555
Yeah, but nobody was ever
honest with you before.

1433
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:56,307
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

1434
01:45:57,309 --> 01:46:00,603
-What do you want? Cigarettes?
-Oh, no, I quit.

1435
01:46:01,146 --> 01:46:03,689
I don't smoke either. I never did.

1436
01:46:04,524 --> 01:46:06,734
-Well, don't I get any credit for that?
-No.

1437
01:46:07,527 --> 01:46:09,862
Did you know I steal in supermarkets?

1438
01:46:09,946 --> 01:46:11,864
And I don't like dogs.

1439
01:46:13,158 --> 01:46:16,535
-You don't like dogs?
-Hate them. Puppies even.

1440
01:46:16,870 --> 01:46:18,954
What do you mean you steal?

1441
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:24,752
Oh, you jerk.

1442
01:46:25,712 --> 01:46:29,548
Just don't ever say
you know all of Jeannie Rapp's secrets.

1443
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:32,885
-You're wearing false eyelashes.
-So?

1444
01:46:33,345 --> 01:46:36,806
You're stupid.
So help me God, you're stupid.

1445
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,351
I'm stupid? You can't even say a decent,

1446
01:46:40,435 --> 01:46:41,852
"Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers".

1447
01:46:41,937 --> 01:46:45,564
All you do is say, "Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled poopers".

1448
01:46:45,649 --> 01:46:47,650
Well, that doesn't make any sense.

1449
01:46:47,734 --> 01:46:50,319
I dream of Jeannie, Peter Piper,

1450
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:53,739
laughing, dancing, having a good time.

1451
01:46:54,366 --> 01:46:56,909
Does it begin to come back to you?

1452
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:59,120
Oh, you're such a child.

1453
01:46:59,204 --> 01:47:02,123
I am not a child.
You're a... You're a lousy dancer.

1454
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:04,375
-You oughta take lessons.
-Well, I took dances.

1455
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:08,504
You know, you have a tin ear, too.
You can't even carry a tune.

1456
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:13,384
But last night, you danced
and you sang and you just let it all go

1457
01:47:13,468 --> 01:47:15,845
and didn't we have a good time?

1458
01:47:16,221 --> 01:47:18,722
You liked making love to me, didn't you?

1459
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:20,558
Yes, I did.

1460
01:47:20,642 --> 01:47:23,310
So, you see, there.
That's good, isn't it?

1461
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,439
And you enjoyed
my company, too, didn't you?

1462
01:47:26,523 --> 01:47:27,982
I enjoyed your company.

1463
01:47:28,483 --> 01:47:31,569
And you said that you trusted me,
didn't you?

1464
01:47:32,279 --> 01:47:33,779
Yes, I did.

1465
01:47:33,864 --> 01:47:38,451
And you thought Peter Piper was
pretty important last night, didn't you?

1466
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:41,704
-Didn't you?
-Yes, I did.

1467
01:47:42,622 --> 01:47:46,792
You see? I'm always right.

1468
01:47:47,252 --> 01:47:49,420
I listened to your demented
dialogue, too, didn't I?

1469
01:47:49,504 --> 01:47:52,798
-Yes, you did.
-And I thought you were crazy, didn't I?

1470
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:56,719
But I made love to you,
and I held you in my arms all night.

1471
01:47:56,803 --> 01:47:58,721
And if you'd been out
in the street last night,

1472
01:47:58,805 --> 01:48:01,557
they'd have had you committed.
Wouldn't they?

1473
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:03,976
Right?

1474
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:05,561
I suppose so.

1475
01:48:06,229 --> 01:48:08,731
You son of a gun.

1476
01:48:10,775 --> 01:48:12,860
How come you hate me now?

1477
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:16,363
Jeannie,

1478
01:48:19,201 --> 01:48:20,784
do me a favour?

1479
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,248
Don't be silly any more.

1480
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,709
Just be yourself.

1481
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:34,006
But I am myself.

1482
01:48:35,926 --> 01:48:37,384
Who eIse would I be?

1483
01:48:38,094 --> 01:48:39,553
I'm serious.

1484
01:48:43,099 --> 01:48:45,142
Definition of "serious".

1485
01:48:46,228 --> 01:48:49,021
Blah, blah, blah, blah.

1486
01:49:05,330 --> 01:49:07,957
Let me get this garbage out of here.

1487
01:49:09,125 --> 01:49:13,462
# I dream of Jeannie
with the light brown hair

1488
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:18,384
# Borne like a vapour on the summer air

1489
01:49:19,177 --> 01:49:23,472
# I see her tripping
where the light something grows

1490
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:29,603
# I dream of Jeannie
with the light brown hair

1491
01:49:30,021 --> 01:49:32,606
# Borne like a... Ah!

1492
01:49:33,191 --> 01:49:35,359
# On the summer air

1493
01:49:36,528 --> 01:49:39,405
# I see her tripping

1494
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:43,784
# Where the light something grows

1495
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:47,538
# Happy as a... #

1496
01:49:51,167 --> 01:49:52,626
FORST: Jeannie.

1497
01:49:54,337 --> 01:49:55,796
Jeannie?

1498
01:50:04,806 --> 01:50:08,767
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

1499
01:50:08,852 --> 01:50:11,687
Now, if Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

1500
01:50:11,771 --> 01:50:14,064
where is the peck of
pickled peppers Peter picked?

1501
01:50:14,899 --> 01:50:17,192
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

1502
01:50:17,277 --> 01:50:19,820
If Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

1503
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:22,615
where's the peck of
pickled peppers Peter picked?

1504
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:24,867
Huh?

1505
01:50:30,040 --> 01:50:32,750
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

1506
01:50:32,834 --> 01:50:35,628
Now, if Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers,

1507
01:50:35,712 --> 01:50:38,631
where is the peck of
pickled peppers Peter picked?

1508
01:50:38,715 --> 01:50:39,882
Peter Piper picked a peck...

1509
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:41,634
Peter Piper picked
a peck of pickled peppers.

1510
01:50:41,718 --> 01:50:45,471
If Peter Piper picked a peck
of pickled peppers...

1511
01:50:54,439 --> 01:50:58,317
Operator, I want
the emergency rescue squad.

1512
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:00,778
My number?

1513
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,405
My number is...

1514
01:52:05,552 --> 01:52:07,010
No way.

1515
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:12,099
Come on.

1516
01:52:41,129 --> 01:52:43,672
Come on, now, drink this, damn it!

1517
01:52:44,716 --> 01:52:46,842
Goddamn bitch. Drink this!

1518
01:53:19,626 --> 01:53:21,084
Please walk.

1519
01:53:26,883 --> 01:53:28,342
Walk.

1520
01:53:28,676 --> 01:53:30,511
Maria, walk, please.

1521
01:53:41,481 --> 01:53:43,816
Walk. Come on.

1522
01:55:04,022 --> 01:55:06,440
Come on, now. Don't go back out.

1523
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:37,346
No. You gotta stay awake. Please.

1524
01:55:39,182 --> 01:55:40,641
I don't want you to die.

1525
01:55:50,568 --> 01:55:52,069
Please, lady.

1526
01:55:56,324 --> 01:56:00,827
You gotta stay awake.

1527
01:56:05,333 --> 01:56:07,542
- You gotta stay awake.

1528
01:56:15,593 --> 01:56:17,219
Hey. Come on. Come on.

1529
01:56:17,303 --> 01:56:19,096
Come on, now! God damn it!

1530
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:21,640
Now, come on!

1531
01:56:30,775 --> 01:56:32,401
That's it! Oh! Oh! Oh!

1532
01:56:32,485 --> 01:56:35,028
Ooh, you gonna cry? Oh! Come on.

1533
01:56:35,571 --> 01:56:37,197
Come on.

1534
01:56:37,281 --> 01:56:40,742
I didn't want to hit you,
but don't go to sleep on me.

1535
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:44,579
Oh! Come on, now. Cry.
That's it. That's life, honey.

1536
01:56:44,664 --> 01:56:47,416
Tears are happiness, man. Just do it.

1537
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,751
Come on, now. Oh.

1538
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:51,378
You silly nut.

1539
01:56:54,424 --> 01:56:56,466
Do you want some coffee?

1540
01:56:56,551 --> 01:56:58,969
Can I trust ya? Huh? Huh?

1541
01:56:59,554 --> 01:57:01,013
Okay. Wait a minute.

1542
01:57:01,097 --> 01:57:03,598
I don't trust ya anyway. I don't.

1543
01:57:04,017 --> 01:57:06,476
- Ah! You little sneaky, you.

1544
01:57:06,561 --> 01:57:08,437
I'm gonna get you some coffee.

1545
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:52,189
I'm cold.

1546
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,105
I like you.

1547
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:37,901
I caused you a lot of pain
and a lot of grief,

1548
01:58:38,569 --> 01:58:40,946
and I almost killed ya.

1549
01:58:41,030 --> 01:58:43,365
And I prayed, man. Oh...
I prayed to God.

1550
01:58:43,449 --> 01:58:46,618
I said, "God, please, dear God,
don't let anything happen to her

1551
01:58:46,702 --> 01:58:49,621
"'cause I love her so much,
and I'll do anything you say, God".

1552
01:58:49,705 --> 01:58:51,998
And, man, I don't even
believe in Him, you know.

1553
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:55,544
But, I mean, it doesn't matter. I...
We protect ourselves.

1554
01:58:55,628 --> 01:58:59,673
So, when you talk ethics
and values and honesty,

1555
01:58:59,757 --> 01:59:03,009
and I'm a nice guy and you're a nice guy

1556
01:59:04,345 --> 01:59:06,763
and this and that, you know,
I mean, it just doesn't matter.

1557
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:12,519
Nobody cares.

1558
01:59:12,603 --> 01:59:16,815
Nobody has the time
to be vulnerable to each other.

1559
01:59:18,317 --> 01:59:20,485
So, we just go on.

1560
01:59:20,570 --> 01:59:26,032
I mean, right away our armour comes out
like a shield and goes around us

1561
01:59:26,117 --> 01:59:29,202
and we become like mechanical men.

1562
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:31,788
Yeah. And I called you
a mechanical woman, huh?

1563
01:59:31,873 --> 01:59:33,915
I got news. I'm so mechanical...

1564
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:37,419
Honey, it's absolutely ludicrous
how mechanical a person can be.

1565
01:59:40,381 --> 01:59:42,215
I am the sexiest guy in the world.

1566
01:59:45,094 --> 01:59:47,846
I have blond hair.

1567
01:59:49,015 --> 01:59:52,434
I can get all the women I want.

1568
01:59:53,227 --> 01:59:55,103
You're waking up, aren't ya?

1569
01:59:55,188 --> 01:59:56,646
Uh-huh.

1570
01:59:57,190 --> 01:59:59,274
You silly little puddin'.

1571
02:00:00,067 --> 02:00:02,569
Yes, I am a silly little puddin'.

1572
02:00:06,866 --> 02:00:10,619
You know, anybody that would
pop a lot of sleeping pills,

1573
02:00:11,495 --> 02:00:12,996
anybody that would

1574
02:00:13,080 --> 02:00:16,082
their guts out, you know,
in front of company,

1575
02:00:16,167 --> 02:00:21,171
anybody that would let a guy slap her
and not be mad at him...

1576
02:00:21,255 --> 02:00:23,590
-You're supposed to be saving my life.
-...hasn't got much to say.

1577
02:00:23,674 --> 02:00:26,468
I've got lots to say. You wanna try me?

1578
02:00:27,762 --> 02:00:30,472
No, I hate you. I really hate you.

1579
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:11,012
# Yes, I know

1580
02:01:15,476 --> 02:01:17,352
# Yes, I know

1581
02:01:17,436 --> 02:01:20,230
# Oh, didn't Daniel in that lions' den

1582
02:01:28,114 --> 02:01:30,949
# Oh, Lord, I'm ready

1583
02:01:31,033 --> 02:01:35,537
# I'll be ready
when that great day comes

1584
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:38,081
# Oh, glory, hallelujah

1585
02:01:38,165 --> 02:01:41,209
# Ready, oh, Lord, I'm ready

1586
02:01:41,585 --> 02:01:44,379
# I'll be ready when that great... #

1587
02:02:43,939 --> 02:02:46,358
I thought you just had problems.

1588
02:02:53,074 --> 02:02:55,867
That's wonderful. That's something new.

1589
02:02:57,161 --> 02:02:58,953
A noble adulteress.

1590
02:03:00,539 --> 02:03:03,041
I think you ought to be rewarded.

1591
02:03:06,170 --> 02:03:10,965
I'll write it into a policy. You commit
adultery, the adulterer gets killed.

1592
02:03:13,177 --> 02:03:17,055
The beneficiary, who is the adulteress,
gets paid off, right?

1593
02:03:17,139 --> 02:03:19,015
Dickie, I don't care.

1594
02:03:23,604 --> 02:03:27,065
Rejected for the thousandth time
in 14 years.

1595
02:03:30,986 --> 02:03:32,695
She doesn't care.

1596
02:03:37,368 --> 02:03:40,954
All I have to do is find
that 1 0-year-old rapist and kill him.

1597
02:03:42,206 --> 02:03:43,748
And then you get paid off.

1598
02:03:43,833 --> 02:03:46,418
You don't need me,
you don't need any man.

1599
02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:48,628
And I'll write the policy.

1600
02:04:00,766 --> 02:04:05,103
What the hell were you doing?
Chasing each other all over the house?

1601
02:04:06,230 --> 02:04:09,649
You couldn't get laid in bed,
so you come down to the kitchen?

1602
02:04:09,733 --> 02:04:13,486
Then you go up and take a shower
to wash off the kitchen?

1603
02:04:18,492 --> 02:04:21,453
You get laid once
and everything is solved!

1604
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:29,002
Get all the soldiers in Vietnam laid and
the whole Middle East problem is solved!

1605
02:04:32,047 --> 02:04:35,717
You want violence, huh?
You want me to be violent? Is that it?

1606
02:04:35,801 --> 02:04:40,305
You want me to slap you across the face
every time you open your mouth?

1607
02:04:47,438 --> 02:04:49,022
I hate my life.

1608
02:04:52,860 --> 02:04:54,777
I just don't love you.

1609
02:05:46,205 --> 02:05:48,498
Throw me a cigarette, please.

1610
02:05:57,091 --> 02:05:58,550
A light.

1611
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:14,482
My lighter, please.

1612
02:06:41,010 --> 02:06:43,636
Those pills, they tie up your lungs.

1613
02:06:45,139 --> 02:06:46,598
Ouch.

1614
02:07:16,795 --> 02:07:19,464
MAN ON RECORD PLAYER:
# Never felt like this before

1615
02:07:19,548 --> 02:07:27,263
# Never felt like this before

1616
02:07:27,348 --> 02:07:30,975
# I see you in the storm

1617
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:34,145
# And you hold me in your arms

1618
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:38,024
# And I feel safe and warm

1619
02:07:38,108 --> 02:07:41,653
# I want you always by my side
Don't you ever let me leave

1620
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:43,946
# Or get away from you

1621
02:07:44,031 --> 02:07:48,284
# I'm gonna stick like glue

1622
02:07:48,369 --> 02:07:51,746
# 'Cause you knew what I was after

1623
02:07:51,830 --> 02:07:55,291
# Now the time is for laughter

1624
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:59,253
# What you doin' standin' way over there

1625
02:07:59,338 --> 02:08:03,925
-Excuse me.
# I want you to come stand over here

1626
02:08:04,009 --> 02:08:07,887
# And never leave me here alone

1627
02:08:07,971 --> 02:08:10,723
# Have you felt like this before

1628
02:08:10,808 --> 02:08:20,733
# Never felt like this before

1629
02:08:21,110 --> 02:08:22,235
# Never felt like this before #
