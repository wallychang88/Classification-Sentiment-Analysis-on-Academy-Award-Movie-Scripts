Billy, it's good
to see you.

Admiral Sims,
General Mitchell.

3
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,126
We've met.

4
00:02:43,627 --> 00:02:45,126
Mitchell,
you know Admiral Gage?

5
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:47,128
We've exchanged
correspondence.

6
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:50,646
This is Commander Landsdowne
of our lighter-than-air service.

7
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:53,647
His dirigible
will patrol the area
during maneuvers.

8
00:02:53,647 --> 00:02:55,647
I know
the commander.
General Mitchell.

9
00:02:55,647 --> 00:02:58,148
I'd like to
clearly state, Billy,

10
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,149
that I'm extremely
and utterly impartial...

11
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:02,149
in your dispute
with the navy.

12
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:04,150
That's why
the general staff
assigned me...

13
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,151
to decide whether
to allow you to
carry out this mission.

14
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:09,652
I assume you have
no objection to me.

15
00:03:09,652 --> 00:03:11,653
I wouldn't want
a fairer judge.

16
00:03:11,653 --> 00:03:14,654
Very well, then.
Admiral, will you state
the navy's position?

17
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:19,154
That battleship
is the primary target
of our maneuvers.

18
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:23,156
The air service believes
that it can be sunk
by aerial bombardment.

19
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,157
The navy denies this...

20
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:28,658
and asks that they
be allowed to sink it
with naval gunfire.

21
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:31,659
Why does the navy feel
the ship can't be sunk
from the air?

22
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:34,660
That ship
was once the pride
of the German navy--

23
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,660
the battleship
Ostfriesland.

24
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,661
The British called her
"the unsinkable Dreadnought."

25
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,162
Are you aware
of these facts, General?
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:44,162 --> 00:03:46,163
Would you care to fly
back to Langley Field?

27
00:03:46,663 --> 00:03:49,164
I'll show you exactly
how I intend to sink her.

28
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,665
Yes, I'll be glad to.
Gentlemen.

What'd you think of that?
All hits or near misses.
Quite impressive.

30
00:04:09,171 --> 00:04:11,672
We'll send that scow
to the bottom
in nothing flat.

and the ambulance!

34
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:27,175

use his parachute?
We have no parachutes.

I guess so.

What happened?

41
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:03,688
It's that fuel line.

42
00:05:03,688 --> 00:05:06,689
I smelled gas
in the cockpit

Why'd you go up

something was wrong?

General,
if it isn't one thing,
it's another.

45
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:16,692
Today it was that fuel line.
Yesterday
it was an oil pump.

46

And last week
I almost lost a wing.

And yet I'm luckier
than a lot of the guys.

an impressive weapon,

00:05:32,196 --> 00:05:35,198
It can be. Come here.
I'd like to show you
something.

One ton

58
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:57,705
You're not trying to tell me
that your planes can carry
a 2,000-pound bomb.

59
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:01,706
Of course they can.
They'll sink the battleship
as though it were a tin can.

60
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,707
Let's be realistic,
Billy.

61
00:06:03,707 --> 00:06:07,207
A 2,000-pound bomb
is not practical
under wartime conditions.

62
00:06:07,207 --> 00:06:10,208
Maybe you'll
get it in the air,
but never to the target.

63
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:12,710
That's exactly
what I want to do.

64
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:15,711
Give me a chance,
and I'll show you
it can be done.

but never in combat.

How high do you want to fly?
I'd like to come in
at a thousand feet.

67
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:26,214
You know as well as I do that
anti-aircraft will knock down
any planes lower than 5,000.

68
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,214
Anti-aircraft?

69
00:06:28,214 --> 00:06:30,215
In a real fight,

70
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:33,216
our pursuit ships
would be in there
strafing their decks.

71
00:06:33,216 --> 00:06:35,717
I have to be realistic
in this, Billy.

72
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:38,718
After all,
we have performance figures
on our guns.

73
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:41,218
But the airplane
is an unproved weapon.

74
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:44,219
I'll prove it to you
if you'll let me.

75
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,720
One of these days,
half the world will be

to be in the other half.

If I sink that ship,
we may have
a real air force.

78
00:06:54,222 --> 00:06:57,723
Where's the money coming from?
There's not enough to go around
for the army and navy now.

The next war will be fought
in the sky anyway.

until a bayonet is put
to the throat of the enemy.

won the last war,
and they'll win the next.

it's the infantry
who will lead the way.

Yes, and we'll

is supposed to simulate
wartime conditions.

If you come in
at a low level...

ever to be practical,

93
00:07:42,237 --> 00:07:45,239
you're simply
staging an exhibition
for your own purposes...

94
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:47,740

the wrong impression.

to both sides, I'm going to
give you two cracks at her.

But you'll have to come in
at 5,000 feet and carry
only the thousand-pound bombs.

97
00:07:56,241 --> 00:07:59,242
Five thousand feet?
Why, that'll rig it all
in favor of the navy.

of this country should
throw their money away...

That's all he told me.

489
00:32:59,815 --> 00:33:01,816
Wait a minute.
[ Tuning Continues ]

490
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:03,816
[ Announcer ]
We interrupt
this broadcast...

491
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,818
to bring you
a news bulletin.

492
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:08,319
In the greatest disaster
 in aviation history,

493
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,819
six planes en route from
San Diego to Fort Huachuca
have crashed.

494
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:15,321
The flight was composed
of members of the famous
Billy Mitchell squadron...

495
00:33:15,321 --> 00:33:18,322
which, in 1921,
bombed and sank
the battleshipOstfriesland.

496
00:33:18,322 --> 00:33:20,322
Ground parties
have been dispatched...

497
00:33:20,322 --> 00:33:23,324
to the rugged
mountain area near
the Mexican border...

498
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:25,324
to search for
possible survivors.

499
00:33:25,324 --> 00:33:28,825
We now return you
to our program.
???? [ Orchestra ]

500
00:33:34,577 --> 00:33:36,577
I've asked you gentlemen
of the press to come here...

501
00:33:36,577 --> 00:33:39,078
because I want to
make a statement.

502
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,081
Flying is a very
dangerous business,

503
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,582
and a normal
amount of accidents
are to be expected.

504
00:33:52,083 --> 00:33:55,584
But these
recent disasters...

505
00:33:55,584 --> 00:33:58,085
of theShenandoah...

506
00:33:58,085 --> 00:34:02,086
and the planes of the army
of the Mexican flight...

507
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:05,087
are outside the range
of normal accidents.

508
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,088
I would not be keeping faith
with my dead comrades...

509
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:12,089
if I kept quiet
any longer.

510
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:15,590
These--
 These accidents...

511
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,091
are the direct result of--

512
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:21,092
of incompetence,

513
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,592
criminal negligence...

514
00:34:23,592 --> 00:34:29,095
and the almost
treasonable administration
of our national defense...

515
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,095
by the navy...

516
00:34:31,095 --> 00:34:33,596
and the war department.

517
00:34:35,096 --> 00:34:37,596
That is my statement.

518
00:34:37,596 --> 00:34:39,597
Well, that's
sure somethin'.

519
00:34:39,597 --> 00:34:41,598
Is this off the cuff?
You want us to print it?

520
00:34:42,098 --> 00:34:43,599
It's a statement
for publication.

521
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,100
Baby, is this gonna
blow some brass tops off.

522
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:48,100
Would you mind
initialing that?

523
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,101
Colonel, my editor's
an ex-army man.

524
00:34:50,601 --> 00:34:53,102
He may call you
to verify this.
Do you mind?
No.

525
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:56,103
I don't know anything about
army procedure, Colonel,

526
00:34:56,603 --> 00:34:58,103
but couldn't you
be court-martialed for this?

527
00:34:58,603 --> 00:35:00,604
That's exactly
what I want.

528
00:35:38,116 --> 00:35:40,616
Colonel Mitchell?

529
00:35:40,616 --> 00:35:42,617
Major.

530
00:35:42,617 --> 00:35:44,618
By order of
the secretary of war,

531
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,119
you've been placed
in arrest, sir.

532
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,120
I've been ordered to
serve on you the charge sheet
and court-martial papers.

533
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,121
Thank you.

534
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:55,122
I'm instructed to tell you
that you're restricted
to the Washington area.

535
00:35:55,122 --> 00:35:58,123
You will remember at all times
that you are in arrest
and deport yourself accordingly.

536
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,123
I understand, Major.

537
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:03,124
Report to the office
of the adjutant general
by noon tomorrow,

538
00:36:03,124 --> 00:36:04,624
where your quarters
will be.

539
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,125
Is that all?
Yes, sir.

540
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:11,127
Now that that's over,
will you gentlemen join me
in a cup of coffee?

541
00:36:12,627 --> 00:36:14,627
Thank you, sir.
I really don't quite--

542
00:36:15,128 --> 00:36:17,128
That's okay, Major.
Carry on.

543
00:36:33,134 --> 00:36:34,633
Mitchell.

544
00:36:36,135 --> 00:36:38,135
Good morning,
General Guthrie.

545
00:36:38,135 --> 00:36:41,636
I don't suppose
it's occurred to you
to resign.

546
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:44,636
Resign under fire?
Not a chance, sir.

547
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:47,137
I must say
I'm sorry, Mitchell.

548
00:36:47,137 --> 00:36:49,139
Sorry for the army.

549
00:36:57,508 --> 00:36:58,508
Good afternoon,
Colonel Mitchell.
Hello.

550
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:00,509
I'll send it
right up.

551
00:37:03,009 --> 00:37:07,010
Welcome back. It's good
to see you again, sir.
Thank you, Phil.

552
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:10,011
Can I have
my old room?
It's ready for you, sir.

553
00:37:12,011 --> 00:37:15,013
Excuse me.
You're Col. Mitchell,
aren't you?
Yes.

554
00:37:15,013 --> 00:37:17,013
I'm Lt. Col. White.

555
00:37:17,013 --> 00:37:20,014
I've been appointed
your defense counsel
by the judge advocate general.

556
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:23,015
I'm glad to see you.
Come up to my room.
We can talk there.

557
00:37:23,015 --> 00:37:25,016
Fine.

558
00:37:29,017 --> 00:37:31,519
I assume, sir,
that you've been served.

559
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,519
Got them right here.

560
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,020
I don't think there'll
be much for you to do.
It's an open-and-shut case.

561
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:39,021
Is it?

562
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:44,022
Oh, yes, I'm guilty.

563
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:46,023
Definitely.

564
00:37:46,023 --> 00:37:48,023
You'll plead guilty?

565
00:37:48,023 --> 00:37:52,525
No, I guess I'll have to
plead not guilty
if I want my day in court.

566
00:37:55,025 --> 00:37:58,026
You mean, you, uh--
you did it
deliberately?

567
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,027
I had to make somebody
listen to me.

568
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:04,529
You chose the hard way,
Colonel.

569
00:38:04,529 --> 00:38:07,029
I know it,
and I haven't
got a chance,

570
00:38:07,029 --> 00:38:10,030
but I want to
go through with it
anyway.

571
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:12,532
Sound crazy,
don't I?
No, sir.

572
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:15,032
No, I, uh,
I think I understand.

573
00:38:15,032 --> 00:38:17,533
Have the members
of the court
been announced?

574
00:38:17,533 --> 00:38:20,533
Just came through.
I saw General Guthrie
downstairs.

575
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:22,535
So did I.

576
00:38:24,034 --> 00:38:26,536
What does he
have to do with it?

577
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:29,537
He's been appointed
the president of the court.

578
00:38:32,538 --> 00:38:35,038
Who are
the other members?
[ Chuckles ]

579
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:37,539

"Maj. Gen. George L. Irwin,
 Gen. Slade, Gen. Graves,

Gen. Ford.,
Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
Gen. Bolling."

582
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:50,043
There's not
a flying officer
among them.

583
00:38:50,043 --> 00:38:53,044
Sir, have you considered
taking on a civilian counsel?

584
00:38:53,044 --> 00:38:56,045
You're entitled to one,
you know.

585
00:38:56,045 --> 00:38:58,045
Could use
the heavy artillery, huh?

586
00:38:58,546 --> 00:39:02,046
Well, honestly, sir,
I don't think we can afford
to overlook any possibility.

587
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,548
Big name?
The biggest possible.

588
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:13,551
I've never had to go
outside the army before.

589
00:39:26,054 --> 00:39:29,555
Why, Col. Mitchell!
It's so good to see you
again, sir.

590
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:32,556
You look as well
as ever, Mrs. Sturges.
Is Congressman Reid in?

591
00:39:32,556 --> 00:39:35,057
Yes, he is.
Go right in.
Thank you.

592
00:39:36,558 --> 00:39:39,058
Hello, Frank.

593
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:42,060
Billy! It's about time
you showed up.

594
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:45,060
Well, you finally did it.
You kicked 'em
where it really hurts.

595
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:47,061
I'm proud of you.

596
00:39:47,061 --> 00:39:50,562
I hope you're here
for the reason I think.
Gonna let me handle this?

597
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:53,062
You're stuck with me.
I've been
counting on it.

598
00:39:53,062 --> 00:39:57,064
Been preparing since you
got in your jam. I'm ready
to go to court tomorrow.

599
00:39:57,064 --> 00:40:00,064
Let's see what section
they've thrown at you.

600
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,065
I thought so.
Article 96,
the catch-all clause.

601
00:40:03,065 --> 00:40:07,067
Covers everything
from kicking a horse
to kissing a sergeant.

602
00:40:07,067 --> 00:40:10,568
"Conduct prejudicial to
 the good of the service,"
my eye!

603
00:40:10,568 --> 00:40:12,570
This is the way
I see it.

604
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:16,570
We won't wait for the
court-martial to start in on us.
We'll open up on them first.

605
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:21,071
We'll call a press conference,
we'll issue a statement,
blast the navy out of the water.

606
00:40:21,572 --> 00:40:23,572
Then we'll take on
the general staff
of the army--

607
00:40:24,072 --> 00:40:25,573
No, Frank, no.
What's the matter?

608
00:40:26,073 --> 00:40:28,574
I don't like it.
I don't want it.
I won't fight that way.

609
00:40:29,074 --> 00:40:31,575
This is what
you've been fighting for
all these years--

610
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:34,576
a chance to get recognition
for the air service,

611
00:40:35,076 --> 00:40:37,577
to tell the people about
the importance of air power.

612
00:40:37,577 --> 00:40:40,578
You haven't changed
your mind about that,
have you?

613
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:43,579
No, I haven't.
I want a new air program
and a new air service.

614
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:46,580
But I don't want
to wreck the army to get it,
or the navy either.

615
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,581
I don't understand you, Billy.
In a fight like this,
it's all or nothing.

616
00:40:52,582 --> 00:40:54,582
[ Sighs ]

617
00:40:54,582 --> 00:40:57,583
I don't see it that way.
I see.

618
00:40:57,583 --> 00:41:00,585
You want to kick
the army in the pants,
but do it politely.

619
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:03,586
All I want is a chance to tell
the whole tragic story...

620
00:41:04,085 --> 00:41:05,586
of this country's
air defense.

621
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:07,587
All I want
is my day in court.

622
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:09,587
And that's exactly
what you'll get--

623
00:41:10,087 --> 00:41:12,588
one day, with Gen. James Guthrie
as president of the court.

624
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:14,589
Have you heard
about Guthrie?

625
00:41:15,088 --> 00:41:18,089
What do you think I do
around Washington,
warm a chair?

626
00:41:18,089 --> 00:41:20,090
What can I do?

627
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,592
Challenge him for prejudice
and kick him off the court.

628
00:41:23,592 --> 00:41:28,093
I'll not be a party to anything
that casts aspersions
on the integrity of an officer.

629
00:41:28,093 --> 00:41:30,594
[ Scoffs ]
The old school tie, huh?

630
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:34,595
The army took me in
when I was a raw kid.
It taught me everything I know.

631
00:41:34,595 --> 00:41:37,095
I'm not at war
with the army.

632
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:40,096
Billy Mitchell,
you're not talking
like your father's son.

633
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:43,598
That great old man would be
fighting with everything he had
to get a fair trial.

634
00:41:44,098 --> 00:41:47,599
I'm being court-martialed
by officers of
the United States Army.

635
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,600
I'll get a fair trial.

636
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:54,101
Unless you believe that, Frank,
don't take the case.

637
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:59,103
All right.
You've handcuffed me,
but I'll try to get you off.

638
00:41:59,603 --> 00:42:01,604
If I do,
it'll be quite a trick.

639
00:42:41,999 --> 00:42:44,1000
This looks like
a warehouse.
Itwasa warehouse.

640
00:42:44,1000 --> 00:42:47,502

into a courtroom.

Just one second,

642
00:43:11,509 --> 00:43:13,509
Thank you.

643
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:18,511
Good morning, Colonel Moreland.
I see we're tangling again.

644
00:43:18,511 --> 00:43:22,011
Yes.
Well, good luck.

645
00:43:26,513 --> 00:43:29,013
It's a fine place
to hide a trial.

646
00:43:29,013 --> 00:43:32,015
I would say they want
as little public attention
as possible...

647
00:43:32,015 --> 00:43:34,516

00:43:40,017 --> 00:43:42,518
George Carlson.
Yes?

651
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:45,019
My son served
under you.

652
00:43:45,019 --> 00:43:49,020
He was shot down
over the Argonne.

653
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:51,521
Do you mean
Glen Carlson?
Yes, sir.

654
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:55,022
Well, I'm very glad
to meet you.

655
00:43:55,022 --> 00:43:57,022
Glen was a fine boy.

656
00:43:57,022 --> 00:44:00,023
Looked a lot like you,
as a matter of fact.

657
00:44:00,023 --> 00:44:03,024
I've always wanted
to thank you for
the letter you wrote.

658
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:05,526
It was such
a great comfort
to us.

659
00:44:05,526 --> 00:44:07,526
I wish I could've
done more.

660
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:10,527
Well, I'm sorry
about all this.

661
00:44:10,527 --> 00:44:13,028
I'd just like to say...

662
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,028
Stand up when
the court enters!

663
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,028
good luck.

664
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:38,536
The court
will come to order.

665
00:44:38,536 --> 00:44:40,537
Colonel Moreland.

666
00:44:40,537 --> 00:44:43,538
The prosecution is
ready to proceed
with the trial...

667
00:44:43,538 --> 00:44:46,539
ofThe United States
against William Mitchell,
Colonel.

668
00:44:46,539 --> 00:44:49,039
Whom does the accused
wish to introduce
as counsel?

669
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:52,040
As counsel,
the Honorable Frank R. Reid,

670
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,041
and as associate counsel
the regularly appointed
defense counsel,

671
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:57,042
Lt. Col. Herbert A. White.

672
00:45:00,043 --> 00:45:02,544
Before this court
is sworn,

673
00:45:02,544 --> 00:45:07,546
I would like to state
that it will be conducted
as a military tribunal.

674
00:45:07,546 --> 00:45:11,046
I expect
the fullest cooperation
from both sides...

675
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:15,047
to bring it to
the speediest possible
conclusion.

676
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:18,548
The trial judge advocate
will now swear in the court
and read the charge.

677
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:21,666
"Further, that the accused
 did conduct himself...

678
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,667
"to the prejudice
 of good order
 and military discipline,

679
00:45:25,167 --> 00:45:26,668
"and in a way
 to bring discredit upon
 the military service.

680
00:45:27,168 --> 00:45:28,819
"Further, that the accused,

681
00:45:28,819 --> 00:45:31,820
"with intent to discredit
 the administration
 of the war department,

682
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:36,321
did make a statement highly
contemptuous and disrespectful
of said administration."

683
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:39,823
Colonel Mitchell,
you have heard the charge
and the specifications.

684
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,823
How do you plead?

685
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,824
Not guilty.

686
00:45:44,824 --> 00:45:47,824
[ Spectators Murmuring ]
The prosecution
may proceed.

687
00:45:47,824 --> 00:45:51,325
The prosecution
does not desire to make
any opening statement.

688
00:45:51,325 --> 00:45:53,326
If the court please,

689
00:45:53,326 --> 00:45:55,827
I wish to withhold
my opening argument...

690
00:45:56,327 --> 00:45:57,827
until the government
states its case.

691
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,829
However, we intend to
show that Col. Mitchell's
statement was justified...

692
00:46:00,829 --> 00:46:03,329
by the deplorable conditions
in the army and navy.

693
00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:05,830
Justification
is not an issue here.

694
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,831
This is a very simple case.

695
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,832
Did or did not the accused
make the newspaper statements
attributed to him?

696
00:46:11,832 --> 00:46:15,333
- If he did, he's guilty.
- Not if the statement's true.
  We want a--

697
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:19,334
You will have an opportunity
to develop that point later,
Mr. Reid.

698
00:46:19,334 --> 00:46:22,335
The trial judge advocate
will call the first witness.

699
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:25,336
The prosecution
calls Carl Tuttle.

700
00:46:27,337 --> 00:46:29,337
Carl Tuttle!

701
00:46:29,337 --> 00:46:32,338
Mr. Tuttle, are you
the author of this article...

702
00:46:32,338 --> 00:46:35,339
which contains
an alleged statement
by the accused?

703
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,842
Yes, sir, I am.

704
00:46:40,842 --> 00:46:43,842
At this time I ask
that this newspaper
be received...

705
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,843
as the prosecution's
exhibit number one.

706
00:46:45,843 --> 00:46:47,844
It will be
so received.

707
00:46:47,844 --> 00:46:49,844
Now, Mr. Tuttle,

708
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:53,845
who gave you this statement
which later appeared in
the columns of your newspaper?

709
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:55,346
Col. Mitchell, sir.

710
00:46:55,346 --> 00:46:58,347
And it was printed exactly
as he gave it to you?
Yes, sir.

711
00:46:58,347 --> 00:47:00,848
Where did Col. Mitchell
give you this statement?

712
00:47:01,348 --> 00:47:02,848
In his office
 in Fort Sam Houston.

713
00:47:03,348 --> 00:47:04,849
How did you happen
to be there?

714
00:47:05,349 --> 00:47:08,851
Col. Mitchell telephoned
my editor and asked him
to send over a reporter.

715
00:47:08,851 --> 00:47:10,851
No further questions.

716
00:47:10,851 --> 00:47:13,351
Does the defense desire
to cross-examine?

717
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:16,352
Mr. Tuttle,

718
00:47:16,352 --> 00:47:18,353
did your paper
make any effort...

719
00:47:18,353 --> 00:47:21,354
to find out the truth
or the untruth of
Col. Mitchell's statement?

720
00:47:21,354 --> 00:47:23,354
Yes, sir.
I was put on the story.

721
00:47:23,354 --> 00:47:25,355
What did you do?

722
00:47:25,355 --> 00:47:28,356
I called up 50 officers
in the various branches
of the service...

723
00:47:28,356 --> 00:47:30,356
and asked their opinion--

724
00:47:30,356 --> 00:47:32,357
Objection.
This is hearsay.
Sustained.

725
00:47:32,357 --> 00:47:35,358
Did the 50 officers
you interviewed all agree...

726
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,360
that the conditions
in the army and the navy,
as described by Col. Mitchell--

727
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,360
Objection!

728
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,361
This is irrelevant
and calls for a conclusion
on the part of the witness.

729
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,862
Sustained.
You must stop when you hear
the court's ruling, Mr. Reid.

730
00:47:47,862 --> 00:47:49,864
I'll put the question
another way, General.

731
00:47:49,864 --> 00:47:52,864
The question
is irrelevant
in any form.

732
00:47:52,864 --> 00:47:56,866
The court directs you
to confine yourself to evidence
permissible under its rulings.

733
00:47:57,365 --> 00:47:59,366
Col. Moreland,
call the next witness.

734
00:48:00,866 --> 00:48:03,367
The prosecution
calls Howard Millikan.

735
00:48:03,868 --> 00:48:08,368
Mr. Millikan, did your paper
receive any letters from
your readers in this matter?

736
00:48:08,368 --> 00:48:10,369
Yes, many.

737
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:13,370
What would you say
was the general tone
of these letters?

738
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,871
Objection.
Question is irrelevant.
Sustained.

739
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:17,872
Were your readers
shocked?

740
00:48:18,371 --> 00:48:21,372
What was their feeling
about Col. Mitchell and his
devotion to his country?

741
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:23,373
Objection.
Question is immaterial.

742
00:48:23,373 --> 00:48:25,874
Do not answer,
Mr. Millikan.

743
00:48:25,874 --> 00:48:28,875
Mr. Reid, my patience
is nearing its end.

744
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:32,877
My belief
in military justice
is also nearing its end.

745
00:48:32,877 --> 00:48:37,378
We have a right to prove
the defendant was justified
in saying what he did.

746
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:39,378
In a military court,
Mr. Reid,

747
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:42,880
there is no justification
for disobedience,
insubordination or treason.

748
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,881
I don't agree,
General.

749
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:48,382
It's one thing when a man
accuses another of being
a murderer without cause.

750
00:48:48,382 --> 00:48:51,382
- It's something else
  when he can prove it.
- I object!

751
00:48:51,382 --> 00:48:53,383
Mr. Reid
is arguing his case.

752
00:48:53,383 --> 00:48:56,884
The issue here is,
did the accused make the
statements attributed to him?

753
00:48:56,884 --> 00:48:59,384
And did he make them
without authority?

754
00:48:59,384 --> 00:49:02,886
On this point,
uncontradicted proof
has been presented.

755
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:05,887
And on this point,
the prosecution rests.

756
00:49:05,887 --> 00:49:08,388
[ Spectators Murmuring ]
[ Guthrie ]
You may step down.

757
00:49:09,888 --> 00:49:11,889
Is the understanding
of the court correct?

758
00:49:11,889 --> 00:49:13,890
The prosecution has
no further witnesses?

759
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:17,390
That is correct, sir.

760
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:19,891
The defense may summon
its first witness.

761
00:49:21,392 --> 00:49:23,392
[ Whispering ]
We got anybody
on deck?
No.

762
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:25,894
I had no idea
they'd finish so quickly.

763
00:49:25,894 --> 00:49:29,394
If it please the court,
witnesses for the defense
are still en route.

764
00:49:29,394 --> 00:49:31,395
They're not present
in Washington?

765
00:49:31,395 --> 00:49:35,897
The brevity
of the prosecution's case
has upset our timetable.

766
00:49:35,897 --> 00:49:38,898
These witnesses
should be standing by,
Mr. Reid.

767
00:49:38,898 --> 00:49:41,899
That would've been difficult
for most of our witnesses,

768
00:49:41,899 --> 00:49:43,899
because they're officers
in the armed forces...

769
00:49:43,899 --> 00:49:45,900
and need special permission
to leave their posts.

770
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,400
Who are these officers?

771
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:52,946
"Major H.H. Arnold,
  Major--"
Just a moment, Mr. Reid.

772
00:49:53,445 --> 00:49:55,945
What would be the nature
of these witnesses' testimony?

773
00:49:55,945 --> 00:49:59,443
- To prove the truth
  of Col. Mitchell's statement.
- The prosecution objects.

774
00:49:59,443 --> 00:50:02,943
The truth or falsity
of Col. Mitchell's statement
is not an issue here.

775
00:50:04,442 --> 00:50:05,942
Was this Major Arnold
present...

776
00:50:06,442 --> 00:50:08,942
when the accused made
the alleged statements
to the press?

777
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:11,440
- No, sir,
  but he'll prove justification.
- Objection.

778
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:14,939
- The court has already
  ruled on that issue.
- Sustained.

779
00:50:14,939 --> 00:50:16,939
Who are
your other witnesses,
Mr. Reid?

780
00:50:16,939 --> 00:50:20,438
"Major Carl Spaatz,
 Capt--"
Objection!

781
00:50:20,438 --> 00:50:22,437
May I see that list,
please, Mr. Reid?

782
00:50:28,436 --> 00:50:30,936

Were any of these people
present in Texas
at the stated time?

786

No, sir, they were not.
Then, I regret to say,
they're inadmissible.

will stand adjourned...

What do you think
about the day's doings,
Col. White?

00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,809
It's court
procedure.

793

My dear friend,
that's not a court.

A man's allowed to
defend himself in court,

They're operating
under army rules,

You stay out of this.
I got to figure out something,
or we're through, licked.

No way of changing
the procedure, Mr. Reid.

You call that
procedure?

The accused is permitted to
give his name and address,
then off with his head.

800
00:51:23,303 --> 00:51:25,303
We'll get our innings.

801
00:51:25,303 --> 00:51:27,302
We'll get nothing.

802
00:51:27,302 --> 00:51:30,301
You don't have a chance
if they don't let us try to
prove you were justified...

in making
that big pronouncement
of yours.

804
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:35,300
It's like refusing
to allow a defendant
to present an alibi.

805
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,299
I'll give them
what you call my alibi.

806

I'll testify and give them
my story in full, for the court
and for the whole country.

And I'll bring up
all the justification
there is.

that statement? Yes or no?"

Am I right, Colonel?
That's right.

of our getting
one justification witness

a copy of theManual
of Courts-Martial,1921.

It states that under
the procedure governing

a charge having been made
must first be referred...

Billy Mitchell has staked
his entire military career
to get it to them.

974
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:30,070
And I know that your husband
would want you to help him.

975
01:01:31,569 --> 01:01:35,068
[ Sniffling ]
You know he would too.

976
01:01:37,567 --> 01:01:40,067
Mrs. Lansdowne, may I ask
why you have waited until now...

977
01:01:40,067 --> 01:01:43,066
to spread this tale
in the newspapers?

978
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:46,564
- Nobody asked me before.
- And who asked you now?

979
01:01:49,064 --> 01:01:51,064
It was my own decision.

980
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:53,063
As I understand it,
Mrs. Lansdowne,

981
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:57,062
you and Col. Mitchell
have been close friends
for a long time.

982
01:01:57,062 --> 01:01:58,562
That's right.

983
01:01:59,062 --> 01:02:03,060
Isn't it possible
that you came here
to aid an old friend...

984
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:06,059
at the expense
of the exact truth?

985
01:02:06,059 --> 01:02:09,059
- I object!
- Sustained.

986
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12,557
Very well.

987
01:02:12,557 --> 01:02:16,057
You say, Mrs. Lansdowne,
that Col. Mitchell did not
ask you to testify here.

988
01:02:16,057 --> 01:02:18,556
That's right.
Did someone else ask you?

989
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:20,555
Yes.
Who?

990
01:02:24,055 --> 01:02:27,054
Congressman Reid.
Congressman Reid?

991
01:02:27,054 --> 01:02:29,553
And did Congressman Reid
suggest...

992
01:02:29,553 --> 01:02:32,552
that you tell the story
as it actually happened,

993
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:36,551
or did he perhaps suggest
that you emphasize
elements in it...

994
01:02:36,551 --> 01:02:38,550
which would prove favorable
to Col. Mitchell?

995
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,049
I object!
 I object most violently...

996
01:02:41,049 --> 01:02:43,549
the suggestion that I
suborned this witness.

997
01:02:43,549 --> 01:02:46,049
I am only trying to find out
why this witness--

998
01:02:46,049 --> 01:02:48,548
You are trying to imply
that I put pressure
on Mrs. Lansdowne...

999
01:02:49,048 --> 01:02:50,547
to come here
and perjure herself.

1000
01:02:51,047 --> 01:02:53,546
I think, sir, that
my reputation in the Congress
of the United States--

1001
01:02:53,540 --> 01:02:57,028
- I am not impugning
  your reputation.
- Order in the court.

1002
01:02:59,518 --> 01:03:02,008
Allow me
to rephrase my question.

1003
01:03:03,503 --> 01:03:07,486
Prior to your appearance here,
was pressure brought to bear
on you?

1004
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:12,469
Yes.
Very strong pressure.

1005
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:14,461
Well.
[ Spectators Murmuring ]

1006

Suppose you tell us
about it.

1007
01:03:17,948 --> 01:03:21,435
- I was told
  not to testify.
- Not-- By whom?

1008
01:03:22,930 --> 01:03:24,921
I'd rather not say.

Tell them who told you
not to testify.

- Objection! I withdraw--
- Let her speak.
  Let her speak.

[ Guthrie ]
Just a moment, Mr. Reid.

1014
01:03:44,349 --> 01:03:49,829
Mrs. Lansdowne,
you're making
a very serious charge.

1015
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:54,311
Are you telling this court
that you were approached
by naval officers...

1016
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:56,802
who asked you
to withhold information?

1017
01:03:56,802 --> 01:03:59,790
Yes, sir.
Tell the court
who they were.

1018
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:02,780
I object! This is irrelevant
and-and immaterial!

1019
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:04,773
Objection overruled.

1020
01:04:05,768 --> 01:04:07,761
I would rather not
identify them.

1021
01:04:09,255 --> 01:04:11,248
They thought
they were doing it
for the good of the navy.

1022
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:15,731
- What did they say?
- They said it was the duty
  of a navy wife...

1023
01:04:16,228 --> 01:04:18,720
to protect the service
at all costs.

1024
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:20,712
Didn't you
agree with that?

1025
01:04:20,712 --> 01:04:23,701
Yes.

1026
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:27,187
They told me that my husband
was a naval hero...

1027
01:04:27,187 --> 01:04:29,181
and that I owed it
to his memory...

1028
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:31,173
not to drag his name
through the mud of a trial.

1029
01:04:32,666 --> 01:04:34,161
Then what made you
change your mind?

1030
01:04:34,660 --> 01:04:38,146
Because
I realized...

1031
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:41,135
that by
telling the truth,

1032
01:04:41,135 --> 01:04:44,622
I would be doing my duty
to the navy and to Zach.

1033
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:50,600
If Zach were alive,
he would be here to
testify for Col. Mitchell.

1034
01:04:51,098 --> 01:04:54,086
I am testifying
in his place
and telling the truth.

1035
01:04:55,581 --> 01:04:58,071
He tried everything.

1036
01:04:59,567 --> 01:05:01,559
He wrote letters,
made phone calls,

1037
01:05:02,057 --> 01:05:04,049
protested to everyone.

1038
01:05:05,045 --> 01:05:07,536
He knew it wasn't safe
to take that ship up.

1039
01:05:09,529 --> 01:05:13,513
On the last day, I drove out
to the mooring mast with him
to say good-bye.

1040
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:17,498
Everything was ready
for the takeoff,

1041
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:20,487
but he kept delaying
the departure.

1042
01:05:20,487 --> 01:05:23,477
He was waiting, hoping
for some last-minute word
from Washington.

1043
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:28,457
We walked to the communication
shack together,

1044
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:31,446
and he asked the chief on duty
if a message had come for him.

1045
01:05:32,940 --> 01:05:36,926
There was none.
And when the ship was ready,

1046
01:05:36,926 --> 01:05:39,914
he kissed me good-bye
and climbed into the cabin.

1047
01:05:42,405 --> 01:05:45,891
He waved to me
through the window once,

1048
01:05:47,387 --> 01:05:49,877
and then he gave the order
to cast off.

1049
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,356
I never saw him again.

1050
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:01,831
Zach and his men were
sent to their deaths
by indifference!

1051
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:05,816
Zach was too young
to be insubordinate,

1052
01:06:05,816 --> 01:06:09,304
too young and too brave
to save his own life.

1053
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:16,278
I see no need
of prolonging
your appearance here.

1054

Thank you, madame.
You are excused.

1055
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,691
The prosecution moves
that Mrs. Lansdowne's
testimony...

1056
01:06:44,189 --> 01:06:45,683
be stricken from the record
as irrelevant...

1057
01:06:46,181 --> 01:06:50,166
and as a violation of
the court's previous ruling
on justification witnesses.

1058
01:06:50,166 --> 01:06:56,143
The defense considers
Mrs. Lansdowne's testimony
to be of extreme relevance.

1059
01:06:56,143 --> 01:06:59,631
Moreover, I request
the court to reconsider...

1060
01:06:59,631 --> 01:07:02,122
its prior ruling about
justification witnesses...

1061
01:07:02,122 --> 01:07:06,106
and allow the defense
to call the witnesses whom
it has previously requested.

1062
01:07:07,601 --> 01:07:11,088
In my opinion,
the entire court should
vote on this objection.

1063

that this changes
the whole picture.

She's just
an emotional woman.

I think we ought
to listen to her...

and to anyone else who may
have pertinent testimony.

1070

I agree with MacArthur.
Well, I don't.

We're here to try Mitchell
for insubordination.

We're not here to listen
to a lot of wailing
about the navy...

1073

or to hear people try to
justify his behavior.

1074

You just said it.
We're here to try Mitchell.

1075
01:07:57,959 --> 01:08:00,423
And to give him a fair trial,
we have to listen
to every bit of evidence...

1076
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:03,872
whether or not it's
technically called
a justification.

Did you hear
what that girl said
about theShenandoah?

1078

Suppose other witnesses
had equally positive
testimony.

1079
01:08:08,305 --> 01:08:11,753
The trial would go on for weeks,
and the publicity would be bad
for everybody.

Well, that's the chance
we have to take.

The whole foundation
of our legal system
and of our country...

1082

on the right of a man
to defend himself,

on his right
to use every means
to defend himself.

at least he's entitled
to tell his story.

we forget that,
we're in grave danger.

First, is it proper
to send an aviator up
without a parachute?

1123
01:10:38,811 --> 01:10:42,753
It's suicidal. It's like
sending a man to sea
without a life preserver.

of the aircraft presently

around our airfields
prove their worth.

01:11:06,892 --> 01:11:10,342
most of your so-called
informedstatements?

1133
01:11:10,834 --> 01:11:16,252
I wouldn't be surprised
at anything in the official
reports you refer to.

1134
01:11:16,252 --> 01:11:18,225
I would be surprised
if anybody believed them.

1135
01:11:18,225 --> 01:11:21,181
No further questions.

1136
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:24,136
Major Spaatz,
what is your present
military assignment?

1137
01:11:24,136 --> 01:11:26,598
I am chief of the
tactical unit section
of the training command.

1138
01:11:26,598 --> 01:11:28,569
Now, Major Spaatz,
can you inform this court...

1139
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:32,510
as to how many planes
our armed forces presently
have for combat purposes?

1140
01:11:32,510 --> 01:11:34,482
Yes, sir. Nine.

1141
01:11:34,974 --> 01:11:38,915
But the War Department
carries on the army list
1,800 planes.

1142
01:11:38,915 --> 01:11:41,378
That is technically
correct, sir.

1143
01:11:41,378 --> 01:11:44,333
But of that number,
1,400 are museum pieces...

1144
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:46,305
which are obsolete
and of little
serviceable use.

1145
01:11:46,797 --> 01:11:48,767
And the remaining 400?

1146
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:52,216
331 of those
were flown in France
in 1917...

1147
01:11:52,216 --> 01:11:54,681
and have not
been modified
or improved since.

1148
01:11:54,681 --> 01:11:56,651
And the remaining 69?

1149
01:11:57,143 --> 01:11:59,113
Sixty are used
for training purposes.

1150
01:11:59,113 --> 01:12:02,563
That leaves nine
for use against
a possible enemy.

1151
01:12:02,563 --> 01:12:06,010
And of that number, not one
pursuit ship is equipped
for wartime service.

1152
01:12:06,010 --> 01:12:08,967
So you believe the organization
of the tactical unit
of the air service...

1153
01:12:08,967 --> 01:12:11,430
is being retarded
by the War Department.

1154
01:12:11,923 --> 01:12:15,863
- I do.
-Thank you, Major.
 Thank you very much.

1155
01:12:15,863 --> 01:12:18,820
Is it your experience,
Mr. La Guardia,
as a member of the Congress,

1156
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:23,253
that younger officers
invariably want to carry out
the wishes of the general staff?

1157
01:12:23,253 --> 01:12:25,225
Well, let me put it
this way.

1158
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,687
When the army testifies
before Congress,

1159
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:31,137
it operates like
a self-greasing axle.
[ Spectators Laugh ]

1160
01:12:31,137 --> 01:12:33,107
Thank you, Congressman.
Your witness.

1161
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:36,554
Mr. La Guardia, is it true
you made a speech in New York...

1162
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:40,990
in which you said Col. Mitchell
is not being tried
by a jury of his peers?

1163
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:44,930
- That is correct.
- By what logic do you
  arrive at the conclusion...

1164
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:49,363
that general officers
in the United States Army
are not equals to Col. Mitchell?

1165
01:12:49,858 --> 01:12:53,305
That's easy. Their feet
are stuck in the mud.
[ Spectators Laugh ]

1166
01:12:53,798 --> 01:12:56,261
Not one of them has ever
flown in an airplane.

1167
01:12:56,261 --> 01:12:59,710
Isn't it possible, Congressman--
having flown a plane yourself--

1168
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:03,159
that your judgment is clouded
by the natural sympathy
you feel...

1169
01:13:03,159 --> 01:13:06,114
for another man
who also flies a plane?

1170
01:13:06,114 --> 01:13:10,055
I have no more
natural sympathy
for an airplane pilot...

1171
01:13:10,055 --> 01:13:12,520
than I do for some
of my colleagues
in Congress.

1172
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:16,460
[ Spectators Laugh ]
Yet you say that officers
who have never flown...

1173
01:13:16,460 --> 01:13:18,431
are not equals
to Col. Mitchell.

1174
01:13:18,924 --> 01:13:22,373
In that respect only.
It's as reasonable
to have them judge him...

1175
01:13:22,373 --> 01:13:24,343
as it is for you
to run for Congress.

1176
01:13:24,343 --> 01:13:27,791
[ Spectators Laughing ]
No further questions.

1177
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:31,241
Admiral Sims, how does
the United States Navy
handle its aircraft?

1178
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:34,688
What is its policy?
Well, it has no policy.

1179
01:13:34,688 --> 01:13:37,152
It bumps along
from day to day.
[ Spectators Laugh ]

1180
01:13:37,152 --> 01:13:40,600
Does the navy
consider the airplane
a major weapon?

1181
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,541
The Navy Department
is ignoring the airplane...

1182
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:47,991
in the hope that,
if they don't notice it,
maybe it'll disappear.

1183
01:13:47,991 --> 01:13:50,453
[ Laughter ]
Thank you, Admiral.
Your witness.

1184
01:13:51,931 --> 01:13:54,888
Admiral, how do you account for
this difference of opinion...

1185
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:57,350
between you and your
colleagues of the navy?

1186
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:01,292
Well, they are just not
educated about the air.

1187
01:14:01,292 --> 01:14:03,263
Surely,
they're capable officers...

1188
01:14:03,263 --> 01:14:06,218
who can inform themselves
on the problems of aviation.

1189
01:14:06,218 --> 01:14:10,160
Reading a lot of golf books
doesn't make a man
a good golf player.

1190
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:15,579
[ Laughter ]
As I understand it, Admiral, you
are no longer in active service.

1191
01:14:15,579 --> 01:14:19,027
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.
  I am retired.

1192
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:24,446
But I can still think for
myself, and I'd like to tell
this court one thing, sir.

1193
01:14:24,446 --> 01:14:27,894
This row on air power
is not a row between
the army and navy.

1194
01:14:28,388 --> 01:14:32,329
It is a clash between
men who love to fly
and men who don't,

1195
01:14:32,822 --> 01:14:35,284
men who think
in terms of air power...

1196
01:14:35,284 --> 01:14:38,733
and men who can't
think at all.

1197
01:14:39,227 --> 01:14:42,675
Col. Moreland,
this Mitchell business
is getting out of hand.

1198
01:14:43,168 --> 01:14:45,138
It looks as though
he's put the army on trial.

1199
01:14:45,138 --> 01:14:48,094
Mr. President, the army
has no intention of being
on the defensive.

1200
01:14:48,094 --> 01:14:51,050
You may depend on that.
The prestige
of our armed forces...

1201
01:14:51,542 --> 01:14:53,514
is being affected
all over the world.

1202
01:14:53,514 --> 01:14:56,469
The sooner this is over with,
the better it'll be
for the whole country.

1203
01:14:56,469 --> 01:15:01,412
I can assure you, sir,
the complexion of the trial
is going to change very shortly.

1204
01:15:01,412 --> 01:15:03,875

Yes, sir.

Well, forget the party
and get a good night's sleep.

on the witness stand

than this quinine.
I'd better get a doctor.

You'll do nothing
of the kind.

Why do you want to do it?
You don't have to.

1247
01:17:46,204 --> 01:17:50,146
Col. Mitchell, at this time,
I remind you that under
the Articles of War,

1248
01:17:50,638 --> 01:17:53,595
you have three choices
as to procedure.

1249
01:17:53,595 --> 01:17:56,058
You may remain silent,
and, if you do so,

1250
01:17:56,058 --> 01:17:59,508
no inference
will be drawn
one way or the other.

1251
01:17:59,746 --> 01:18:03,246
You may, if you wish,
make a statement
not under oath.

1252
01:18:03,747 --> 01:18:05,747
Or you may be sworn,

1253
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,749
in which case,
you'll be subject
to cross-examination.

1254
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:10,751
The rights of the accused
have been explained to him,

1255
01:18:10,751 --> 01:18:13,251
and he elects
to testify under oath.

1256
01:18:21,255 --> 01:18:24,757
Do you swear the testimony
you shall give in
the proceedings now before us...

1257
01:18:25,255 --> 01:18:29,258
shall be the truth,
the whole truth and nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

1258
01:18:29,258 --> 01:18:31,260
I do.

1259
01:18:34,762 --> 01:18:36,762
May it please the court,
I should like to note
the addition...

1260
01:18:36,762 --> 01:18:40,764
of Major Allan Gullion
to my staff.

1261
01:18:40,764 --> 01:18:43,264
He shall conduct
the cross-examination
of Col. Mitchell.

1262
01:18:43,264 --> 01:18:46,767
Who's he?
One of the best legal minds
in the army.

1263
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:48,769
I didn't know
he was in Washington.

1264
01:18:53,770 --> 01:18:56,270
And now, Colonel,
as an aviation expert,

1265
01:18:56,270 --> 01:18:58,773
as a flyer who's been
highly honored
by his government...

1266
01:18:58,773 --> 01:19:01,274
for his services
in war and in peace,

1267
01:19:01,774 --> 01:19:03,775
is there something you wish
to say in conclusion?

1268
01:19:06,776 --> 01:19:10,277
As an officer
in the United States Army,

1269
01:19:10,277 --> 01:19:12,779
I had to choose between
my duty to the army...

1270
01:19:12,779 --> 01:19:15,780
and what I considered
to be my duty
to my country.

1271
01:19:17,281 --> 01:19:20,782
I chose the distasteful
method of inviting
my own court-martial...

1272
01:19:20,782 --> 01:19:25,285
because I felt
in no other way
could I focus attention...

1273
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:27,787
upon a desperately
urgent problem.

1274
01:19:27,787 --> 01:19:31,789
I hope I've made it clear
that our country needs
an adequate air force.

1275
01:19:31,789 --> 01:19:36,790
But above and beyond that,
it needs immediate
consideration...

1276
01:19:36,790 --> 01:19:39,291
for the safety
of our flyers.

1277

Thank you, Colonel.

1279
01:19:48,795 --> 01:19:52,798
I know your words
will not go unheeded
by the people of this country.

1280
01:19:52,798 --> 01:19:55,548
You may cross-examine.

1281
01:19:59,551 --> 01:20:03,552
[ Knocks ]
Col. Mitchell, I've been
studying your war record,

1282
01:20:03,552 --> 01:20:07,054
and I must confess
it overwhelms me.

1283
01:20:07,054 --> 01:20:10,556
Those ribbons on your breast,
sir-- would you mind stating
what decorations they represent?

1284
01:20:12,558 --> 01:20:16,557
The Distinguished Service Medal,
the Distinguished Service Cross,
the Legion of Honor,

1285

the Crown of Italy,

01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:21,562
the Order of Saint Michael
and Saint George
and the Croix de Guerre.

1287
01:20:21,562 --> 01:20:24,562
That's very interesting, sir.
Now, Colonel,
to your knowledge,

1288
01:20:24,562 --> 01:20:28,065
are you the only American
officer in the army today
that wears such decorations?

1289
01:20:28,065 --> 01:20:30,065
Of course not.
Many other officers
wear them.

1290
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:33,067
I see.
Now, tell me this.

1291
01:20:33,067 --> 01:20:36,068
Have any of these
other officers
ever been court-martialed?

1292
01:20:36,068 --> 01:20:40,069
Objection. That's immaterial.
You needn't answer that,
Colonel.

1293
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:44,071
I was merely trying
to establish what
a unique officer you are.

1294
01:20:44,071 --> 01:20:46,073
But you are.
You are very,
very different...

1295
01:20:46,073 --> 01:20:48,073
and a special
sort of man.

1296
01:20:50,076 --> 01:20:53,076
I assume, Col. Mitchell,
you share with me
the respect I have...

1297
01:20:53,076 --> 01:20:55,077
for those officers
in the American army...

1298
01:20:55,077 --> 01:20:57,577
who wear as distinguished
decorations as your own?

1299
01:20:57,577 --> 01:20:59,579
Of course.
They earned them.

1300
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:02,579
By risking their lives
in combat in the defense
of their country?

1301
01:21:02,579 --> 01:21:06,082
Yes.
Then why did you
call such men traitors?

1302
01:21:06,582 --> 01:21:09,584
Objection.
That question assumes
facts not in evidence.

1303
01:21:10,084 --> 01:21:13,086
Objection overruled.

1304
01:21:13,086 --> 01:21:15,585
To repeat the question,

1305
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:18,588
in your statement
 in San Antonio,

1306
01:21:18,588 --> 01:21:21,588
why did you call
such men traitors?

1307
01:21:21,588 --> 01:21:24,589
I wasn't referring
specifically to any officer.

1308
01:21:24,589 --> 01:21:26,591
But you certainly must
have had some men in mind...

1309
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:30,093
when you accuse
the general staff of conduct
that was virtually treasonable.

1310
01:21:32,094 --> 01:21:36,097
I was thinking of the system,
the system of administering
air power...

1311
01:21:36,097 --> 01:21:38,098
in the army
and the navy.

1312
01:21:38,098 --> 01:21:42,098
I see. You were speaking
in generalities.
Yes.

1313
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:46,101
But isn't it possible, sir,
that many of your statements
have been generalities?

1314
01:21:46,101 --> 01:21:48,600
No, sir.

1315
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,604
And am I to understand,
when you use a phrase,

1316
01:21:53,604 --> 01:21:57,606
"guilty of criminal
 negligence,"
that you meant that?

1317
01:21:58,107 --> 01:22:02,108
That statement was
and is accurate.

1318
01:22:02,108 --> 01:22:04,109
Negligence
of the ordinary--
No. Forgive me--

1319
01:22:04,109 --> 01:22:06,610
Forgive me
for interrupting, Colonel,

1320
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:10,611
but I'm sure the court
would like to be clear
on this point.

1321
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:16,614
You do then reiterate
your accusation...

1322
01:22:16,614 --> 01:22:22,118
that certain high-ranking
officers in the American
army are criminals.

1323
01:22:22,118 --> 01:22:24,119
You're twisting my words.

1324
01:22:25,619 --> 01:22:30,121
Col. Mitchell,
did your public attack
on the army...

1325
01:22:30,121 --> 01:22:33,622
start after
a series of accidents
involving your friends,

1326
01:22:33,622 --> 01:22:37,125
in which some
of your friends were--
were killed?

1327
01:22:37,125 --> 01:22:39,626
Yes.
Isn't it possible, sir,

1328
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:45,128
that the sense of grief
that you felt
over their loss...

1329
01:22:45,628 --> 01:22:48,130
inspired you
to make your statement?

1330
01:22:48,130 --> 01:22:51,631
It did not.
Then why didn't you
attack your superiors...

1331
01:22:51,631 --> 01:22:55,134
before the accidents
involving your friends?

1332
01:22:55,134 --> 01:22:57,134
I wasn't ready.

1333
01:22:57,134 --> 01:23:00,136
You mean
you didn't think the iron
was hot enough to strike?

1334
01:23:02,136 --> 01:23:04,137
I recall no such thought.

1335
01:23:04,137 --> 01:23:08,139
And don't you mean
that you wanted to wait
until you felt sure...

1336
01:23:08,139 --> 01:23:11,640
that the newspapers
would be on your side?

1337
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,141
On the side of a bigger
and better air service.

1338
01:23:14,141 --> 01:23:17,642
You consider the press qualified
to influence and dictate
to the armed forces?

1339
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:21,645
I object to this whole
line of questioning
as irrelevant and immaterial.

1340
01:23:21,645 --> 01:23:25,647
The matter before this court
is the facts behind
the alleged offense.

1341
01:23:27,648 --> 01:23:29,649
May it please the court.

1342
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:34,651
The accused is attempting
to establish justification
for the offense,

1343
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:37,653
and I'm trying to prove
that there's no
justification.

1344
01:23:37,653 --> 01:23:39,653
[ Guthrie ]
Sustained.

1345
01:23:39,653 --> 01:23:44,139
Colonel, I have here
original letters
written by you...

1346
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:48,641
to the War Department
over the period
of the last two years.

1347
01:23:49,642 --> 01:23:52,643
You recognize them?
They're mine, all right.

1348
01:23:52,643 --> 01:23:55,143
I've read them
with great interest.

1349
01:23:55,143 --> 01:23:59,146
I'm glad somebody did.
[ Laughs ]

1350
01:23:59,146 --> 01:24:01,648
I should like to question you
about some of the statements...

1351
01:24:01,648 --> 01:24:04,148
you make
in these communications.

1352
01:24:04,148 --> 01:24:06,149
You say here that
"In future wars,

1353
01:24:06,149 --> 01:24:08,651
"soldiers will invade
 peaceful lands...

1354
01:24:08,651 --> 01:24:13,152
by leaping in parachutes
from airplanes in the sky."

1355
01:24:13,152 --> 01:24:15,654
Would you care to reveal
who gave you
this startling information?

1356
01:24:15,654 --> 01:24:17,655
Nobody gave it to me.

1357
01:24:17,655 --> 01:24:21,657
It's quite obvious
to anyone with
the slightest foresight.

1358
01:24:21,657 --> 01:24:25,659
I see. Then do you mean
that the chiefs of staff
of the army and navy...

1359
01:24:25,659 --> 01:24:28,160
are not only treasonable
and incompetent...

1360
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:30,661
but are lacking
in foresight as well?

1361
01:24:30,661 --> 01:24:33,663
You said that.
I didn't.
[ Spectators Laugh ]

1362
01:24:33,663 --> 01:24:36,163
Now, in this letter,
you recommend that
the armed forces...

1363
01:24:36,163 --> 01:24:38,165
be separated
into three branches--

1364
01:24:38,165 --> 01:24:42,668
the army, navy
and the air force.

1365
01:24:42,668 --> 01:24:45,168
Is that your opinion?
It is.

1366
01:24:45,668 --> 01:24:48,169
Why did you seek to divide
the fighting forces
of this country?

1367
01:24:48,670 --> 01:24:50,670
I didn't mean
to divide them.

1368
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:52,672
I recommended that
they all be combined...

1369
01:24:52,672 --> 01:24:55,173
under a single Department
of National Defense...

1370
01:24:55,173 --> 01:24:57,173
with specialists
in command of each branch.

1371
01:24:57,173 --> 01:25:00,174
And did you see yourself, sir,

1372
01:25:00,174 --> 01:25:03,176
in the role of the specialist
 in command of the air force?

1373
01:25:03,176 --> 01:25:06,679
Objection. The line
of questioning up to now
is a familiar one...

1374
01:25:06,679 --> 01:25:09,179
seeking to falsely
characterize
the accused...

1375
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,180
by the clever
manipulation
of semantics.

1376
01:25:13,181 --> 01:25:15,182
Sustained.

1377
01:25:17,182 --> 01:25:21,184
You state here that "The army
should investigate methods
of protection against air raids,

1378
01:25:21,184 --> 01:25:23,687
including alarm signals
and bomb shelters."

1379
01:25:23,687 --> 01:25:25,687
[ Chuckles ]
Bomb shelters.

1380
01:25:26,187 --> 01:25:30,690
Is it your actual belief that
this country is vulnerable
to attack from the air?

1381
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:34,692
It is my belief, if not now,
at least within
the foreseeable future.

1382
01:25:34,692 --> 01:25:38,192
Col. Mitchell, do you have
any idea of the width
of the Atlantic Ocean?

1383
01:25:38,192 --> 01:25:40,194
Approximately 3,000 miles.

1384
01:25:40,194 --> 01:25:44,196
And the Pacific Ocean?
I know what you're
getting at, and I tell you,

1385
01:25:44,196 --> 01:25:48,698
it won't be long before
an airplane will fly
nonstop across both oceans.

1386
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:51,199
Carrying bombs.
Carrying bombs.

1387
01:25:51,199 --> 01:25:55,700
Col. Mitchell, do you realize
that your declarations,
if taken seriously,

1388
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:59,703
could result in creating
panic among the people
of our country?

1389
01:25:59,703 --> 01:26:03,705
I'd rather have the people
scared than dead.
[ Spectators Laugh ]

1390
01:26:05,204 --> 01:26:07,206
Now, here's one
in which you propose
that the government...

1391
01:26:07,206 --> 01:26:09,708
build an academy
like West Point for airmen.

1392
01:26:09,708 --> 01:26:11,709
What do you have
against West Point?

1393
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:14,210
I have nothing
against West Point.

1394
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:18,211
It's a fine school
for infantrymen.

1395
01:26:18,211 --> 01:26:20,714
There should be
an equally good school
for flyers.

1396
01:26:22,212 --> 01:26:24,715
Now, in this one, you make
the statement that, quote,

1397
01:26:24,715 --> 01:26:26,715
"Airships traveling
 a thousand miles an hour...

1398
01:26:27,216 --> 01:26:31,719
will fight each other
in the stratosphere."
Unquote.

1399
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:36,220
Col. Mitchell, do you have
any comprehension how fast
a thousand miles an hour is?

1400
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:39,721
Of course I do.
Do you know that it's faster
than the speed of sound?

1401
01:26:39,721 --> 01:26:43,724
It's approximately
250 miles faster
than the speed of sound.

1402
01:26:43,724 --> 01:26:47,225
Are there any airplanes today
that can go 250 miles an hour?

1403
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:50,726
Wedon't have any.
 I can tell you that.
[ Laughter ]

1404
01:26:50,726 --> 01:26:55,730
But you said, sir, that
they wouldn't only go
250 miles an hour,

1405
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:58,731
but they would go
250 miles...

1406
01:26:58,731 --> 01:27:01,231
faster than
the speed of sound.

1407
01:27:01,231 --> 01:27:04,232
That's correct.
Well, now, would it be
asking too much...

1408
01:27:04,734 --> 01:27:07,735
if I could learn from you
what crystal ball...

1409
01:27:07,735 --> 01:27:10,235
you got
these astounding facts from?

1410
01:27:10,235 --> 01:27:13,737
Objection. The prosecutor's
attempting to ridicule
the witness.

1411
01:27:13,737 --> 01:27:16,740
I'll answer that question.
There is no crystal ball.

1412
01:27:17,238 --> 01:27:19,239
Anyone with any knowledge
of the air knows...

1413
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:24,242
that the ultimate speed
of aircraft
is almost unlimited.

1414
01:27:24,242 --> 01:27:26,745
It depends only
on technical developments.

1415
01:27:28,745 --> 01:27:31,746
Amazing.

1416
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:34,747
Here's a letter
to headquarters you wrote
after a short trip to Hawaii.

1417
01:27:34,747 --> 01:27:38,750
You say, quote,
"The army and navy commands
 here are concerned...

1418
01:27:38,750 --> 01:27:41,249
"principally with the question
 of jurisdiction.

1419
01:27:41,249 --> 01:27:43,251
"There is so much
 petty bickering between them...

1420
01:27:43,251 --> 01:27:46,753
that the Islands are virtually
undefended." Unquote.

1421
01:27:46,753 --> 01:27:49,254
[ Spectators Murmuring ]
Do you consider that
a proper observation...

1422
01:27:49,254 --> 01:27:52,254
to be made by an officer
about his superiors?

1423
01:27:52,254 --> 01:27:54,256
That was written
in connection
with my belief...

1424
01:27:54,256 --> 01:27:57,259
that air power
will control the Pacific.

1425
01:27:57,259 --> 01:28:00,760
It's very important that
the missions of the army,
the navy and the air...

1426
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:02,859
be-- be sharply defined.

1427
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:07,263
Thank you.

1428
01:28:07,263 --> 01:28:10,764
You seem to have quite a bit
to say about Hawaii, Colonel.

1429
01:28:10,764 --> 01:28:13,265
For example,
you write that...

1430
01:28:13,265 --> 01:28:18,767
"Pearl Harbor has no adequate
 defense against air attack--

1431
01:28:18,767 --> 01:28:22,269
It hasn't.
"and that a foreign power
 could attack...

1432
01:28:22,269 --> 01:28:25,837
and reduce the Hawaiian Islands
in a matter of minutes."

1433
01:28:25,837 --> 01:28:28,338
Do you actually
believe that?
I not only believe it,

1434
01:28:28,338 --> 01:28:31,341
if you'll look into
those letters, you'll find
my specific observations...

1435
01:28:31,341 --> 01:28:34,342
on how it can be done.

1436
01:28:34,342 --> 01:28:36,342
I was coming to that.

1437
01:28:36,342 --> 01:28:39,344
Oh, yes. Here it is.

1438
01:28:40,844 --> 01:28:45,847
Your letter dated
December 14, 1923.

1439
01:28:45,847 --> 01:28:47,849
I'll read this slowly
and distinctly...

1440
01:28:47,849 --> 01:28:51,850
because I want the court
to know that you are
second to none,

1441
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:55,850
that you are an expert
in palmistry,

1442
01:28:55,850 --> 01:28:59,353
table-tipping
and the reading of tea leaves.

1443
01:28:59,353 --> 01:29:02,356
I object!
The prosecutor's
being abusive.

1444
01:29:02,356 --> 01:29:06,856
- Objection sustained.
