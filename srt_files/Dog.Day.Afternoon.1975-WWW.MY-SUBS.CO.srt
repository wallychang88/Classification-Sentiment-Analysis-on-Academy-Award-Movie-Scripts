1
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,875
It has to be from downtown.

2
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,630
It's handled through this office,
but it requires downtown approval.

3
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,217
I don't know.

4
00:04:21,638 --> 00:04:23,348
It has been submitted.

5
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:58,132
Sylvia, can you help me with this?

6
00:04:58,716 --> 00:04:59,801
Coming.

7
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,028
Closing time. Going in?

8
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:23,032
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

9
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,039
I couldn't say.

10
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,795
- You the manager?
- It's a matter of policy.

11
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,008
It... It looks...

12
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,719
Keep talking like nothing was wrong.

13
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:46,889
Listen, let me call you back.

14
00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:55,648
Sonny, I'm getting really bad vibes.

15
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:59,569
What are you talking about?

16
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:03,114
Maybe we should take
something smaller, Sonny.

17
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,911
You crazy? He started already.
He's got the gun out.

18
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:11,831
Go on, go over by the door.

19
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:16,711
Get over by the door.

20
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,137
Freeze!

21
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:10,181
- Nobody move.
- Get over there!

22
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,227
Okay. All right, get away
from those alarms. Come on!

23
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,395
Come on, get in the center.

24
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,191
He moves, take his head off.

25
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,443
Put the gun on him!
Get out of the center.

26
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:24,862
Sonny.

27
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,906
I can't do it, Sonny.

28
00:07:28,324 --> 00:07:31,202
- What?
- I'm not gonna make it.

29
00:07:32,912 --> 00:07:36,040
- What? Put it on him.
- I can't do it, Sonny.

30
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,376
Oh, fuck me. Sal.

31
00:07:39,794 --> 00:07:40,878
- Sal.
- What?

32
00:07:41,045 --> 00:07:43,297
Where are you? He can't make it.

33
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:44,674
Fuck him. Let him go!

34
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,760
Come on, Sonny!

35
00:07:49,387 --> 00:07:51,389
All right, let him out.

36
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:53,975
- Let him out!
- Do what the gentleman says, Howard.

37
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:55,768
Let him out!

38
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,273
I'm sorry, Sonny.

39
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,275
Oh, shit.

40
00:08:03,276 --> 00:08:05,945
- Stevie, don't take the car.
- How do I get home?

41
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,615
Take the subway. We need the car.

42
00:08:09,991 --> 00:08:12,410
Stevie, the keys.

43
00:08:14,412 --> 00:08:16,164
- I'm sorry, Sonny.
- Right.

44
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,790
All right, lock it.

45
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,292
Shit.

46
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,884
- What do you want?
- Sonny, there's a girl under that desk.

47
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:37,727
All right, go.

48
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,358
We got rid of him.
So now we just move it along.

49
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,194
- Sal, you got them?
- I got them.

50
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:49,238
Okay. What'd he say to me?
Wait a minute.

51
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:51,490
Anybody here?
What's this, a squirrel?

52
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:54,577
Hey, you. Come on. Go ahead.

53
00:08:54,744 --> 00:08:57,413
In the back there.
No one's gonna hurt you.

54
00:08:57,997 --> 00:08:59,582
Go ahead, get to the back.

55
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,627
- Pull the drapes!
- Howard.

56
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,966
Now, you, to the back there.

57
00:09:09,217 --> 00:09:10,927
Go to him, right there.

58
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:15,139
Okay. We're gonna move this now.
Just moving along.

59
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:18,392
Come on. Gotcha. Gotcha.

60
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:23,105
We're moving right along, folks. Gonna
get this thing done in half an hour.

61
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,316
We just gotta block....

62
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,318
Oh, shit.

63
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,819
Here.

64
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:33,324
Knock out the TV.
There we go.

65
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:37,245
See? No replay, folks.
No alarms.

66
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,622
Let's get you all fixed up
and on your way.

67
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,416
- Right. Is the vault open?
- I can take care of that.

68
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,710
That's good. Let's go. Take care of it.

69
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:50,633
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you trying to do?

70
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:53,844
Trip the alarm? Use the spot key?

71
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,974
- I must've been out of my mind.
- You get your mind right!

72
00:09:58,391 --> 00:10:01,143
I'm a Catholic. I don't wanna
hurt anybody, understand?

73
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:03,187
- Yes, sir.
- No alarms.

74
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,022
- No alarms!
- Okay.

75
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:06,899
No games, all right?

76
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,652
Use the other one.

77
00:10:10,945 --> 00:10:12,113
Miriam...

78
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:13,864
...open the safe.

79
00:10:15,074 --> 00:10:17,952
It's all right. It's all right.

80
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,467
Here. Put it in this.

81
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,109
What?

82
00:10:50,776 --> 00:10:52,653
That's all there is.

83
00:10:55,573 --> 00:10:56,907
What are you talking about?

84
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:59,744
They picked it up today.
There's only $1100.

85
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,872
- It's true.
- He's gonna shoot me.

86
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,958
I can't believe it.

87
00:11:06,709 --> 00:11:08,794
I can't believe it.

88
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:11,714
There's no money here.

89
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:15,384
- Come on, Sonny, let's do it!
- I'm doing it!

90
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:21,515
Too much. This is too much.
This is too much.

91
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,476
All right, come on. Let's go.

92
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:27,438
Somebody... You answer it.

93
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:31,025
Watch him, Sal. You, come with me.
Watch him.

94
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:35,279
- Sit down.
- Who's the head teller here?

95
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,156
- I am.
- Come here.

96
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:43,579
All right, open it up.

97
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,334
Nope, not all of it.

98
00:11:48,501 --> 00:11:51,670
Look, I worked in a bank.
I know the alarms. All right?

99
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:53,672
Don't play games with me. See.

100
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,925
You take one of these,
go like this...

101
00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:57,802
...in here, and out it comes.

102
00:11:58,052 --> 00:11:59,220
You got your 100.

103
00:11:59,762 --> 00:12:01,305
I'll call you back.

104
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:05,559
No, it's decoy money. It's marked.

105
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:07,478
It's shit.

106
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,021
See?

107
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:14,777
Cheer up, you'll be
the veterans of a robbery.

108
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,821
You know the bank
sends you a dozen red roses?

109
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,699
Sal, let him answer it.

110
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,413
Hey, you. Manager. Fucker!
Don't get ideas.

111
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:27,581
I bark, that man there, he bites.

112
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,376
- Believe me, I'm on your side.
- On my side, shit.

113
00:12:30,543 --> 00:12:34,046
Listen, we got young girls here.
You could watch your language.

114
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,760
I speak what I feel.

115
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:43,431
"Watch my language."
Empty the drawer out.

116
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,184
I don't know.
You'd have to find out from him.

117
00:12:47,685 --> 00:12:49,270
Traveler's checks...

118
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,022
...and the register.

119
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,192
The register.

120
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:59,613
You've got it.
All right, let's go.

121
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,992
I'll take that from you.

122
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,120
All right, Sal, here we go.

123
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:10,374
Shit.

124
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:21,552
Come on.

125
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,517
- Shit.
- Sonny, what the hell are you doing?

126
00:13:28,851 --> 00:13:30,936
I'm burning the register here.

127
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,609
Moving right along, folks.

128
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:39,612
All right. Okay.

129
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:43,365
We're leaving.
Let me have the keys.

130
00:13:43,908 --> 00:13:45,242
Howard, give him the keys.

131
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:49,038
- Come on.
- Howard.

132
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:51,832
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
We're gonna leave.

133
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,673
Sonny. Who's that?

134
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,009
It's the insurance guy
from across the street.

135
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,594
He probably saw the smoke.

136
00:14:12,686 --> 00:14:15,064
Please, put out the fire.

137
00:14:28,536 --> 00:14:30,412
- I'll get some water.
- Stay right there!

138
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:33,666
No, no, please, don't...! Don't do it!

139
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,752
- I'll call you back later.
- Get rid of him.

140
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,463
- Come on, get rid of him!
- Howard.

141
00:14:40,422 --> 00:14:41,757
Howard.

142
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:50,724
- Hey. Hey. Use your head.
- I can handle it.

143
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:01,652
- Everything's all right?
- Cigarette butt got in the wastebasket.

144
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:07,408
- Well, then you're okay.
- Yeah. Thanks for keeping an eye out.

145
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,159
Okay.

146
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,249
- Good.
- Go now. We gave you all we've got.

147
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:16,417
Okay, we're going.

148
00:15:17,751 --> 00:15:20,004
Answer the phone.
Sal, get them in the vault.

149
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:21,630
Come on, in the vault.

150
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,049
- Where's the money?
- I'm getting it. Got it.

151
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,726
He's gonna come with us. Okay.

152
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:36,729
No, please don't close that door.
How can we breathe?

153
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:38,689
- I can't explain. I'll call...
- Right.

154
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:40,733
Wait a minute.

155
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,526
- Wait a minute. Listen.
- What?

156
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:45,446
I'll never make this.
I'll have to go to the toilet.

157
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:49,742
Honey, it's no joke.

158
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:53,037
I got a terrible fear of being locked in.

159
00:15:57,249 --> 00:16:00,169
- Who has to go to the bathroom?
- I do too.

160
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,173
- See, now they all wanna go.
- Look, do you wanna check it out?

161
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,301
It's the first door on your right.

162
00:16:09,762 --> 00:16:12,139
All right, Mouth, let's go.

163
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:16,518
First door on my right.

164
00:16:17,436 --> 00:16:18,479
It's Maria!

165
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:22,650
Listen, I... I forgot she's in there.
It's not her fault.

166
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,736
She's always pulling this.
She's supposed to have 10 minutes...

167
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:29,198
- ...she takes 15...
- Shut up! Nobody goes to the bathroom.

168
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:31,742
- Let's go, out.
- We're having a bank robbery.

169
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:36,163
Mulvaney speaking.

170
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:37,998
All right, Mouth. Mouth.

171
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,084
- Here's your toilet.
- It's for you.

172
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,628
- What?
- Telephone call.

173
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,839
For you.

174
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,278
Yeah.

175
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,489
<i>- What are you doing in there?</i>
- Who's this?

176
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:15,744
<i>Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti,
asshole. We got you by the balls.</i>

177
00:17:15,994 --> 00:17:19,540
<i>I'm looking you right in the eye.
Right now I can see you.</i>

178
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:20,791
- Who is it?
- Cops.

179
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,356
You come to the front door....

180
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:46,150
Hang it up.

181
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:10,257
Get on the side of the street.

182
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,759
Come on, let's go.

183
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:15,304
How'd that happen?

184
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:19,516
Did I do anything to hurt you?
Did I treat you badly?

185
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:21,602
Look at my salary.
I won't be a hero.

186
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,812
Did you have a plan or what?

187
00:18:24,062 --> 00:18:26,023
What did you do,
just barge in on a whim?

188
00:18:26,899 --> 00:18:29,735
- Why'd you have to light a fire?
- I told you to get out...

189
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:32,154
...when you could,
but you had to hang around.

190
00:18:32,321 --> 00:18:34,364
He don't have a plan.
It's all a whim.

191
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,325
- Rob a bank, right?
- I had it planned!

192
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,162
Only the money should have
been delivered, not taken away.

193
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,291
That fucking Jack, downtown, he gave
me the wrong information. That fuck!

194
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:47,795
What is this Jack supposed to be?
A mastermind or what?

195
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:49,421
I wouldn't be arguing with me.

196
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:52,966
We're all in a barrel together
and we wanna get out of it.

197
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,344
Oh....

198
00:18:56,094 --> 00:18:59,723
All right, I gotta have time to think.
I gotta think.

199
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,308
Oh, shit.

200
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:21,411
Listen, bastards. You keep away,
or we'll start throwing bodies out...

201
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,080
...one at a time. Got that?

202
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,377
Who is this?

203
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:40,305
There a Jenny here?

204
00:19:40,472 --> 00:19:43,851
- Who's Jenny here?
- That's me.

205
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,144
It's the squirrel. You got a husband?

206
00:19:47,479 --> 00:19:50,399
Yeah? Well, he's on the phone.
Go ahead.

207
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:53,610
Well, what could I tell him?

208
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:56,697
I don't know, tell him whatever.
Tell him the truth.

209
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:59,950
What a fucking comedy.
W-N-E-W, plays all the hits.

210
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,743
<i>Listen. Now, don't hang up.</i>

211
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,830
- First off, is anybody hurt in there?
<i>- No.</i>

212
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,001
Keep away, or we'll start throwing
bodies out, one at a time. You got that?

213
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,754
Don't do that. Let me talk to you for
a while. How many people you got?

214
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,172
<i>No, call me back.</i>

215
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,592
- Call me back.
- Excuse me.

216
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:21,096
He said he wants to know
what time you'll be through.

217
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,724
What? Oh, girlie, please.

218
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:33,942
Come on. Let's go.

219
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,410
- Where's the back door?
- It's locked on the inside.

220
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,953
Where is it?

221
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:47,331
Through the passageway to the right.

222
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,294
Sal, cover them, cover them.

223
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:55,714
You could just go ahead
and cook whatever's there.

224
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,390
<i>Ready for riot gang. 3-4, sergeant.</i>

225
00:21:05,557 --> 00:21:07,768
<i>3-4, sergeant. Is that roof...?</i>

226
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,912
<i>- Negative.
- Tell units preset.</i>

227
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,707
Oh, yes, I will. Yes, I will.

228
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:33,919
- Let's go, come on.
- Honey, I've gotta go now.

229
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:36,046
I gotta go.

230
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,465
I love you too.

231
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,593
All right, inside here.

232
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:47,808
Sal, I don't know what happened.

233
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,228
Maybe somebody tripped an alarm
or something. I don't know.

234
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,814
- But there's a way out of this.
- Listen.

235
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:57,192
- Were you serious about what you said?
- About what?

236
00:21:57,943 --> 00:22:00,028
About throwing...

237
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,784
About throwing those bodies out the door?

238
00:22:08,286 --> 00:22:10,414
That's what I want him to think.

239
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,082
I wanna know what you think.

240
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,215
Because I'll tell you right now,
I'm ready to do it.

241
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,551
Right. Okay.

242
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,054
- I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

243
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:29,141
All right.

244
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,185
Listen, everybody.
I know we got a problem here, right?

245
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:35,188
But there's a way out of this thing.
I'm telling you.

246
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:38,025
All you gotta do is cooperate with me.

247
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:40,652
Stay cool, and we'll get out of this,
all right?

248
00:22:40,902 --> 00:22:42,904
Nobody gets hurt if you listen to me.

249
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:47,284
First, we'll do things a step at a time.
You gotta go to the bathroom, right?

250
00:22:47,534 --> 00:22:49,202
She'll get to go to the bathroom.

251
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:52,039
Everybody who has to go
will get to go to the bathroom.

252
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:53,498
We'll do things together.

253
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,501
Now, stay cool...
What's the matter with him?

254
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,588
He's got asthma.

255
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:03,133
- Asthma?
- Yeah, asthma.

256
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,519
Asthma. Shit.

257
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:17,773
Um... All right, I'll take care of that.

258
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,983
- You, what's your name?
- Mulvaney.

259
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,194
Mulvaney? Come with me.

260
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:27,032
- He's got asthma and he's a guard?
- They go to guard school.

261
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,826
To learn what, how to shoot?
He doesn't have a gun.

262
00:23:29,993 --> 00:23:33,038
They earn a $105 a week
to fold the flag in the morning...

263
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:35,499
...straighten up.
I don't know what they learn.

264
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:40,212
All right, I wanna block that door.
In case they try coming in, I can hear it.

265
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,005
All right. Let's move this.

266
00:23:46,468 --> 00:23:48,512
Wait a minute. Hold it, hold it.

267
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,099
Let's get rid of this.

268
00:23:57,854 --> 00:23:59,189
You got kids?

269
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:01,858
I got two kids and I'd like
to see them again.

270
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:04,736
You'll see them again.
You're being cooperative with me.

271
00:24:04,903 --> 00:24:07,864
I got no complaints
against you, whatsoever.

272
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,992
Whatsoever. You got bank insurance?

273
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,788
You know I do. You seem
to know a lot about bank procedure.

274
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,416
I know a lot about a lot of things.

275
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:24,589
I just wanna get you
out of here safe, right?

276
00:24:26,341 --> 00:24:28,301
What if I take you with me?

277
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:29,970
If you take anybody...

278
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,139
...please take me.

279
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:34,057
They'll shoot you, you know?

280
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:35,559
The cops...

281
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,688
...don't care about bank insurance.
See what they did in Attica?

282
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:44,192
Forty-two people, they killed.
The innocent with the guilty.

283
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:46,945
Anyway....

284
00:24:49,698 --> 00:24:54,244
I won't take you. I'll take one of
them girls, a married one with kids.

285
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:58,456
Cops don't like it in the papers when
they shoot a married woman with kids.

286
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,087
You're all right.

287
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:07,215
You won't fuck with me, will you?

288
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,275
Come on, set a car.

289
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:28,028
- Help with those barricades.
- Move them back.

290
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:37,954
There's the FBI.

291
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:43,627
How you doing, Sheldon?

292
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:08,443
Why didn't you wait
and try to take them outside?

293
00:26:08,777 --> 00:26:10,111
I made an error in judgment.

294
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,740
Thought the S.O.B.s would be
remorseful at the sight of a policeman.

295
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:17,661
And you know something?
Nobody said "hostage" yet, understand?

296
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,124
- We have a bank robbery here.
- Yeah.

297
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:28,463
How did the press guys
get through the barrier?

298
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:38,056
We don't know what's up yet.
We're setting up communications.

299
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:41,601
This is Ron Cummins from CBS.
Can you tell me the situation?

300
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:45,188
We got the... We're setting up
communications now.

301
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:47,065
The perpetrators are in the bank.

302
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:48,608
That's all I can say now.

303
00:26:48,858 --> 00:26:52,612
When I get it, you'll get it.
That's all. Okay.

304
00:26:53,029 --> 00:26:55,031
What are you doing
on the fire escape?

305
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,743
I said on the roof.
Now, get up on the roof, will you?

306
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:49,753
- Get the phone company?
- It's being set up now.

307
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,756
This phone is gonna be
a direct line into the bank.

308
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:02,140
- Mulvaney speaking.
<i>- Moretti here. Let me talk to him.</i>

309
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,146
- Yeah.
<i>- Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti.</i>

310
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,190
- Yeah.
- Okay...

311
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:12,859
...you're in there, we're out here.
What do we do?

312
00:28:13,026 --> 00:28:15,111
- I don't know. What do we do?
<i>- Listen.</i>

313
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:19,032
- Are the people in the bank okay?
- They're okay.

314
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:22,827
<i>- You alone or you got confederates?</i>
- I'm not alone.

315
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:27,499
- I got Sal.
- Sal, what's that for, Salvatore?

316
00:28:27,665 --> 00:28:30,210
Yeah. Sal, he's a killer.

317
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,588
We're Vietnam veterans
so killing don't mean anything to us.

318
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,465
<i>- In the Army?</i>
- In the Army, yeah.

319
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:40,178
- So there's you, what's your name?
- Why do you wanna know my name?

320
00:28:41,012 --> 00:28:43,848
Give me any name.
Just so I got something to call you.

321
00:28:51,189 --> 00:28:54,818
Let's be reasonable, okay?
Just give me your name.

322
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:57,570
Uh.... Call me Sonny.

323
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,072
<i>- Sonny?</i>
- Yeah.

324
00:28:59,239 --> 00:29:00,824
Okay. Now listen, Sonny.

325
00:29:01,074 --> 00:29:02,992
I wanna see if the people are okay.

326
00:29:03,243 --> 00:29:04,661
<i>- Right.</i>
- Yeah.

327
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:07,455
Then I wanna work out a way
to get them out of there.

328
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,582
I wanna come over without a gun.

329
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:13,044
You can frisk me so you can trust me.
We'll find a way out of this.

330
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:14,337
Right.

331
00:29:14,504 --> 00:29:18,758
I just wanna find some way
that I can trust you too.

332
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:21,469
Not be on the street
where you could just shoot me.

333
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:24,139
<i>- Some sign, right?</i>
- Right. Like what?

334
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,182
How about letting the people out?

335
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:30,145
Come on, now. Who do you think you're
dealing with? A fucking idiot here?

336
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:32,730
They're keeping me alive.
I'm gonna let them out?

337
00:29:32,897 --> 00:29:35,567
Talk to me. Just talk to me straight.
I'm ready to talk.

338
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,570
Okay, okay.
How about giving us the women?

339
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:41,156
No, I've got women.
That's all I've got here.

340
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:43,867
Okay. Give me something.
Give me one of them.

341
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:46,369
- Why do you want one?
<i>- It's like a fair exchange.</i>

342
00:29:46,619 --> 00:29:48,746
- I'll come over. I won't pack nothing.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

343
00:29:48,913 --> 00:29:52,083
I don't know if you'll take me hostage.
It's a sign of trust.

344
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,503
- How do I call you back?
<i>- We got a direct line here.</i>

345
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:57,714
Pick up the receiver and I'm here.

346
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:01,301
He wants one.

347
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:07,682
- Him, right?
- Right.

348
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,392
- Right?
- Right.

349
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,437
- Okay? He goes.
- Okay.

350
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,147
Can you get up?

351
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,152
What are we dealing with here?

352
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,656
Hey, you have to keep
checking me out all the time?

353
00:30:24,282 --> 00:30:25,492
Yeah.

354
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:29,245
- Here you are. Your stomach okay?
- It's all right.

355
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,165
He'll need the keys.

356
00:30:32,832 --> 00:30:34,042
Got the keys?

357
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,713
- Just the one, Sonny!
- Right.

358
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:56,022
- Hey, don't fire! Don't fire!
- What are you doing?

359
00:30:56,189 --> 00:30:58,483
- Get away from him!
- That's a hostage!

360
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,530
<i>- Don't fire, don't fire. Hold your fire.</i>
- Hold your fire!

361
00:31:03,696 --> 00:31:05,573
We voted to send him out!

362
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,244
- He's one of the hostages!
- Get away from him!

363
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:11,955
- What's the matter with you?
- He's a hostage!

364
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:15,625
He's one of the hostages.
What the hell's the matter with you?

365
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:19,379
I don't give a fuck, goddamn it!
Get away. Get out of here.

366
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,507
Hey, Sonny! Wait a minute, Sonny.

367
00:31:22,757 --> 00:31:25,093
That was your fault, Sonny.

368
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,887
You know we had
the communications set up here.

369
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:31,015
We're not set up properly.
We've got 250 cops here.

370
00:31:31,182 --> 00:31:33,017
We don't know
what's going on in there.

371
00:31:33,268 --> 00:31:36,396
- You almost killed him! Are you crazy?
- That was smart.

372
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:41,401
You say you got nothing but women,
and throw out a guy. What's going on?

373
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:43,528
You wanted a hostage,
I gave you one.

374
00:31:43,778 --> 00:31:46,864
- You gonna deal with us or not?
- I gave you one.

375
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:50,410
You did, but you should have picked up
the phone. Come on out.

376
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:53,705
Look. I ain't packing nothing, see?

377
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,248
I ain't packing nothing.

378
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,668
You can come out and frisk me.
You can tell.

379
00:32:00,795 --> 00:32:03,298
- Why you want me to come out?
- To look at something.

380
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:07,385
- To see what you're up against.
- I can see it. Why come out?

381
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:10,471
Come out and see it all, all right?
Come on.

382
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:12,974
All right?

383
00:32:13,516 --> 00:32:18,146
Sal is in there with the other people.
Anything happens to me, they'll get it.

384
00:32:18,521 --> 00:32:21,691
I don't forget about Sal.
Come out and look. Okay?

385
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,110
Come on. Okay?

386
00:32:24,277 --> 00:32:25,653
I gotta check with him first.

387
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:28,364
All right. You don't need that artillery.

388
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:38,333
Sonny, five minutes.
You tell him that.

389
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:40,293
Take it easy.

390
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:43,212
Get them back. He's got a white flag.

391
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:45,381
All right. Okay.
Everything's all right.

392
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:48,760
- See that?
- Right, yeah. Okay.

393
00:32:49,761 --> 00:32:52,430
- Come on out, Sonny.
- He's too close here.

394
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:54,557
Get back!
What the fuck are you doing?

395
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,267
- Get them back.
- Get back!

396
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:59,604
- All right.
- Okay. Come on out.

397
00:32:59,854 --> 00:33:02,357
Take a look at this. Come on.

398
00:33:02,523 --> 00:33:05,109
Here, look. Look up here. Look.

399
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:06,444
Look.

400
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,989
Look over here, huh?

401
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:17,038
Over there, right?
We got everything here, okay?

402
00:33:35,098 --> 00:33:37,266
You got the militia out here, huh?

403
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:49,237
Let Sal come look.
What hope have you got? Huh?

404
00:33:49,404 --> 00:33:51,197
Come on. Quit while you're ahead.

405
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,866
- It's only attempted robbery.
- Armed robbery.

406
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:56,536
All right, armed, then.
Nobody's been hurt.

407
00:33:56,786 --> 00:34:00,415
Release the hostages. No one
will worry over kidnapping charges.

408
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,083
The most you'll get is 5 years.

409
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,043
- You'll get out in one year.
- Kiss me.

410
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:06,295
- What?
- Kiss me.

411
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,465
When I'm being fucked,
I like to get kissed on the mouth.

412
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,635
You're a city cop, right?
Bank robbery's a federal offense.

413
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:16,055
They got me on kidnapping, armed
robbery. They're gonna bury me.

414
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,224
I won't talk to somebody
trying to con me.

415
00:34:18,391 --> 00:34:20,268
- Get someone in charge.
- I am in charge.

416
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:24,105
I won't talk to some flunky pig
trying to con me. What's he doing?

417
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:26,190
- Get back!
- Why are they moving in?

418
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:30,611
Will you get the fuck back there?
Get back there. Get over there!

419
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:33,030
- Go on back there, man!
- Get over there!

420
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:35,366
He wants to kill me so bad,
he can taste it.

421
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:38,870
- No one's gonna kill anybody.
- Attica! Attica! Attica!

422
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,082
Attica! Attica! Attica!

423
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:45,585
Attica! Attica!

424
00:34:47,044 --> 00:34:49,881
Attica! Attica! Attica!

425
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:51,966
Attica!

426
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:55,303
Attica! Remember Attica!

427
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:03,603
Go ahead. Go ahead.
Your word don't fucking matter!

428
00:35:03,895 --> 00:35:05,563
Come on, calm down.

429
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:11,277
...to put their guns down!

430
00:35:11,944 --> 00:35:13,362
Put your guns down!

431
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,615
Wasn't for the TV guys,
they'd kill us all.

432
00:35:18,826 --> 00:35:21,120
Tell them to put their guns down!
Get back!

433
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,206
- Put those guns down!
- Put the guns down!

434
00:35:23,372 --> 00:35:26,000
Get back!
Put those fucking guns down!

435
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,960
Put those guns down!

436
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,464
Put them down! Put them down!

437
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:34,675
Put those fucking guns down.

438
00:35:34,926 --> 00:35:37,053
Put those guns down.

439
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,850
Attica! Attica!

440
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:56,197
You got it, man!
You got it, man!

441
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:58,574
You got it, man!

442
00:35:59,492 --> 00:36:01,577
You got it! You got it!

443
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:08,417
You got it, man! You got it, right?
You got it, right?

444
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:12,880
You got it. You got it.
You got it, right?

445
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:15,091
<i>headquarters in Washington...</i>

446
00:36:15,258 --> 00:36:16,968
- Robbing a bank?
- What was...? What?

447
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,178
<i>- -as to the identity
of one of the men.</i>

448
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:22,682
Why didn't he tell me
he needed money?

449
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:27,395
He should've come to me
if he needed money.

450
00:36:28,062 --> 00:36:30,231
I can't believe it.

451
00:36:30,398 --> 00:36:34,569
<i>We know that eight people
are still being held in the bank.</i>

452
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:38,865
<i>The situation inside the bank
is totally unknown to us other than...</i>

453
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,910
<i>...descriptions that have been
obtained from Howard Calvin.</i>

454
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,329
Why steal when your mom's a sucker?

455
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,500
<i>We'll switch you now to Ron Cummins
at the bank in Brooklyn.</i>

456
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:52,211
<i>Miss Benson, what's it like inside?</i>

457
00:36:52,837 --> 00:36:54,714
They're holding up, what can you say?

458
00:36:54,922 --> 00:36:57,216
- The guy with the gun on us...
- Got a deal?

459
00:36:57,383 --> 00:37:01,762
- ...he's a quiet type.
- Any confidence in Detective Moretti?

460
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:05,766
They don't know Detective Moretti yet.
I gotta go now.

461
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:08,519
What's this with the hands?

462
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,813
She's out, let her stay out.

463
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:13,232
They're my girls.
I'm going back in there.

464
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:27,371
- Howard, how is he?
- Howard's all right.

465
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:30,499
- Put the TV on.
- Girls, I was interviewed.

466
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:33,920
Sal, looks good.

467
00:37:34,879 --> 00:37:37,173
Everybody's out there.
They got the whole media.

468
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,383
Television people. Television people...

469
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:42,261
...they wanna talk to you.
They're out there.

470
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,685
Yeah?

471
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:52,563
<i>Hello, Sonny.
Sonny, you're on the air.</i>

472
00:37:52,813 --> 00:37:55,358
<i>- Would you answer a few questions?</i>
- Yeah.

473
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:58,361
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

474
00:38:02,531 --> 00:38:04,075
<i>- Hello?</i>
- See, now...

475
00:38:04,241 --> 00:38:06,202
...I just saw myself there.
What'd you...?

476
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:08,120
- Why am I doing it?
<i>- Yes.</i>

477
00:38:08,287 --> 00:38:10,873
- Doing what?
<i>- Robbing a bank.</i>

478
00:38:11,916 --> 00:38:13,417
Oh.

479
00:38:14,043 --> 00:38:15,878
Uh....

480
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:18,172
What? I don't know
what you mean by that.

481
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:21,133
I'm robbing a bank
because they got money here.

482
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:24,428
<i>I mean, why do you feel
you have to steal for money?</i>

483
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,097
<i>Couldn't you get a job?</i>

484
00:38:28,182 --> 00:38:30,476
No. Doing what?

485
00:38:30,768 --> 00:38:34,981
You know... You know, if you want a job,
you gotta be a member of a union.

486
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:38,317
See. If you got no union card,
you don't get a job.

487
00:38:38,693 --> 00:38:40,361
<i>What about non-union jobs?</i>

488
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:45,074
What's wrong with this guy?

489
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,035
What do you mean, non-union?
Like what, a bank teller?

490
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,371
- Know how much a bank teller makes?
- Not much.

491
00:38:50,538 --> 00:38:54,917
Not much. $115 to start, right?
You gonna live on that?

492
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:59,422
I got a wife and kids. How am I gonna
live on that? What do you make a week?

493
00:38:59,672 --> 00:39:03,092
<i>- I'm here to talk to you, Sonny.</i>
- No, well, I'm... I'm talking to you.

494
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:06,679
We're entertainment, right?
What do you...? What do you got for us?

495
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,931
<i>What do you want to get for it?</i>

496
00:39:09,181 --> 00:39:13,227
<i>- Do you expect to be paid?</i>
- I don't need to be paid. Look.

497
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:17,523
I'm here with my partner and nine
other people, see, and we're dying.

498
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:21,152
You're gonna see our brains on the
sidewalk. They'll spill our guts out.

499
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,820
Gonna show that on television?

500
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,823
Have housewives see that?
Instead of <i>As the World Turns?</i>

501
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:28,367
What do you got for me?
I want something for that.

502
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:29,618
<i>- Sonny.</i>
- Yeah.

503
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:32,371
<i>- You could give up.</i>
- Give up?

504
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:34,790
- Right. You ever been in prison?
<i>- No.</i>

505
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:38,169
No. Let's talk about something
you fucking know about, okay?

506
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:42,214
- How much you make a week?
<i>- Transmission has been interrupted.</i>

507
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:45,968
<i>Please stand by, we will return
to our special newscast very soon.</i>

508
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:48,679
Hello? What the fuck happened?

509
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:50,639
Hey.

510
00:39:51,265 --> 00:39:53,309
Guess he didn't appreciate
your language.

511
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:56,771
Fuck him.

512
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:04,695
Sal.

513
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:08,949
Sal.

514
00:40:25,007 --> 00:40:27,176
I don't know,
they might deal with us.

515
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:31,680
You know? I mean, I don't know about
that guy out there.

516
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:36,477
But if I get the FBI involved in this,
they might deal.

517
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:38,270
What do you think?

518
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,489
No.

519
00:40:48,823 --> 00:40:50,074
- Sal....
- No!

520
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,536
- What's the matter with you?
- You made a promise, didn't you?

521
00:40:53,702 --> 00:40:55,496
- Did you promise me something?
- Yeah.

522
00:40:55,663 --> 00:40:59,416
Did you say either we get away clean
or we kill ourselves?

523
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:02,461
- Did you?
- I'm not talking about that.

524
00:41:02,628 --> 00:41:04,755
- You believe in keeping your promises?
- Yeah.

525
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,632
- Then does it still go?
- Yeah.

526
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,093
- Well, what are you talking about?
- I'm trying to...

527
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:14,849
I ain't going back to that prison, Sonny.

528
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:21,981
- Yeah.
<i>- Kill them all. Now.</i>

529
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:25,359
<i>- Take your bayonet, jam it into their...</i>
- Fuck you, you fucker.

530
00:41:37,872 --> 00:41:40,040
Shit.

531
00:42:03,397 --> 00:42:06,108
We ask for a jet. What do you think?

532
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:14,408
We get a helicopter.

533
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:18,162
We get a helicopter here,
it lands on the roof...

534
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:23,292
...and takes us to a jet.
And we fly the fuck out of the country.

535
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:28,088
Sal. Sal...

536
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:29,924
...we can do it.

537
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,264
Sal. Sal, look.

538
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:41,018
We got them. We don't even know it.
We got the hostages.

539
00:42:41,936 --> 00:42:45,773
We've been looking at this the
wrong way. We make the demands.

540
00:42:46,023 --> 00:42:48,734
They're gonna give us
anything we want.

541
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,493
I'm flying to the tropics.
Fuck the snow.

542
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:05,209
Hey, where's the Mouth?

543
00:43:06,543 --> 00:43:10,881
- You ready to go to Algeria?
- Algeria? Yeah, sure.

544
00:43:11,257 --> 00:43:13,008
We're all going to sunny climes!

545
00:43:13,175 --> 00:43:16,262
Sal, I can make it happen!
I can make it happen!

546
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:20,432
I made it happen so far, right?
I can make it happen.

547
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:29,775
- Yeah.
- Give me Moretti.

548
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,735
Sarge.

549
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,156
All of you, go ahead, make phone calls.
Call home or whatever.

550
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:38,158
We're all going on a trip.

551
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,661
<i>- Yeah, Sonny.</i>
- Yeah. I wanna talk to you.

552
00:43:40,953 --> 00:43:43,998
<i>- And I'm coming out.</i>
- Good, I'll be there.

553
00:43:44,248 --> 00:43:46,000
Let's go. Come on, he's coming out.

554
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:47,501
Sal.

555
00:43:47,918 --> 00:43:50,587
Now, you gotta understand something.

556
00:43:50,838 --> 00:43:54,049
If we leave the country,
there's no coming back here.

557
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:56,593
There's no coming back.

558
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,138
If there's anyone you wanna talk to...

559
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:02,391
...you wanna say goodbye to,
do it now.

560
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,397
No.

561
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,524
No.

562
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:13,527
Is there any special country
you wanna go to?

563
00:44:16,488 --> 00:44:18,324
Wyoming.

564
00:44:20,034 --> 00:44:22,870
No, Wyoming....
That's not a country.

565
00:44:24,121 --> 00:44:26,415
That's all right. I'll take care of it.

566
00:44:49,563 --> 00:44:51,774
All right, put them down!

567
00:44:55,027 --> 00:44:57,946
Put them down. You need a gun?
What do I have?

568
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:01,700
See this here, look.
I got nothing up my sleeve.

569
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:05,829
I got nothing here either.
Wanna see my pockets? Here.

570
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,625
You need that gun, right? Yeah.

571
00:45:10,501 --> 00:45:13,629
Moretti, tell them
to put their guns down!

572
00:45:13,796 --> 00:45:17,674
Hey, you, see that?
Put it in your holster.

573
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,180
Put the guns down!

574
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:29,019
You know what it means
to put a gun down? What's this?

575
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,272
- What's this?
- Put them down.

576
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:36,235
Right. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

577
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,779
You got it, right?

578
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,157
You got it, baby! Hey, Moretti!

579
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:44,159
You ready to let these...?

580
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:51,583
You got Maria in there!

581
00:45:54,378 --> 00:45:56,338
Maria!

582
00:45:57,089 --> 00:46:00,592
He's got a gun in there! Maria!

583
00:46:02,094 --> 00:46:04,721
Maria! Maria!

584
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:08,225
Get him the fuck out of here!

585
00:46:09,268 --> 00:46:10,894
How the hell did that happen?

586
00:46:11,145 --> 00:46:13,397
- I got Sal in there!
- Take it easy.

587
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,525
- Notify the precinct, all right?
- Who the fuck is that?

588
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:19,069
No, no, no.
He's one of them Spanish kids.

589
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:20,779
- Who's Maria?
- She's inside.

590
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,699
Sal wants to see Sonny,
says he'll shoot unless he does.

591
00:46:23,866 --> 00:46:26,952
- Sal. Sal.
- He's serious. Sonny, he means it!

592
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,330
- He means it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

593
00:46:31,123 --> 00:46:32,499
It's all right.

594
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:37,504
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- How'd that happen?

595
00:46:37,671 --> 00:46:40,299
You got his girlfriend.
You know the Spanish. You okay?

596
00:46:40,466 --> 00:46:42,301
That fuck tried to kill me.

597
00:46:42,551 --> 00:46:45,387
- You look all squeezed out.
- Squeezed out, I'm squeezed out.

598
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:48,474
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Wait, let me see.
Let me see your head.

599
00:46:48,724 --> 00:46:51,018
- I'm bleeding.
- Let me see it.

600
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:52,728
Let me see it.

601
00:46:52,895 --> 00:46:56,440
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

602
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:01,487
It's all right. You want to
talk to me about something?

603
00:47:02,154 --> 00:47:04,114
You should've heard that phone call.

604
00:47:04,364 --> 00:47:06,658
Calls up, some creep,
says, "Kill everybody."

605
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:08,660
Everybody wants to kill everybody.

606
00:47:08,911 --> 00:47:11,538
You're gonna get assholes like that
anyhow, right?

607
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:13,081
Right.

608
00:47:17,085 --> 00:47:19,755
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.
I got an offer.

609
00:47:21,048 --> 00:47:22,591
I want a helicopter out of here.

610
00:47:24,218 --> 00:47:27,429
And a jet to go wherever I wanna go.

611
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,973
So I don't want a little jet,
I want a big one.

612
00:47:30,224 --> 00:47:33,644
One with a bar, a piano.
Maybe I wanna go out of the country.

613
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,523
I don't know, Sonny. I don't know
whether a helicopter'll fit in here or not.

614
00:47:37,981 --> 00:47:39,149
I'll check it out.

615
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,610
- It could land on the roof.
- No, that's asphalt.

616
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:43,904
You know what'll happen,
it'll break through.

617
00:47:44,071 --> 00:47:46,782
I'll call my superiors, you understand?

618
00:47:47,032 --> 00:47:49,117
Why don't you
bring your superiors here?

619
00:47:49,368 --> 00:47:52,079
Why am I talking to you
if you gotta call your superiors?

620
00:47:52,454 --> 00:47:56,083
- We don't always see eye-to-eye.
- Yeah, so I'll talk to them.

621
00:47:56,291 --> 00:47:57,626
I'll see what they say.

622
00:47:57,876 --> 00:48:01,129
I talk to them and I ask them,
all right? Then we'll see.

623
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,006
Anything else I can give you?

624
00:48:06,593 --> 00:48:09,429
Yeah, I want you to bring
my wife down here.

625
00:48:10,097 --> 00:48:12,307
- What do you give us?
- What do you want?

626
00:48:13,141 --> 00:48:14,601
The women hostages.

627
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,689
Oh, man. You know,
there's no talking to you.

628
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:21,900
That's all I got in there,
I told you, is women.

629
00:48:22,776 --> 00:48:24,820
You gonna talk to me or what?

630
00:48:26,655 --> 00:48:29,491
I'll give you one hostage
for each thing you give me, see?

631
00:48:29,658 --> 00:48:31,785
Give me the helicopter,
I give you a hostage.

632
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:33,787
Give me the jet, I give you a hostage.

633
00:48:34,037 --> 00:48:36,582
You give me my wife,
I give you a hostage.

634
00:48:36,832 --> 00:48:39,084
Then the rest come home on the jet.

635
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:43,255
I'll see what they'll do, all right?

636
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,633
In the meantime, you pick out
who you wanna give us.

637
00:48:46,883 --> 00:48:49,803
And you tell me where
your wife is, all right?

638
00:48:50,345 --> 00:48:54,266
<i>I'm here minding my own business,
I hear the transistor, go, "Sonny what?"</i>

639
00:48:54,516 --> 00:48:56,852
<i>I can't believe my ears.
I grab the kids.</i>

640
00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:00,397
<i>I'm telling you, Sonny didn't do it.
It ain't him to rob a bank!</i>

641
00:49:00,647 --> 00:49:04,151
<i>It ain't him to steal or hurt anybody
or do nothing wrong!</i>

642
00:49:04,443 --> 00:49:07,112
<i>He's never done wrong
since the day I know him.</i>

643
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:11,325
<i>Night before last we're at Coney Island.
I'm looking in the glove compartment.</i>

644
00:49:11,491 --> 00:49:13,410
<i>He's got a gun with bullets in it.</i>

645
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:16,246
<i>Things are adding up
how crazy he's acting lately...</i>

646
00:49:16,496 --> 00:49:19,666
...and in with a bad crowd.
So I look at him.

647
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:22,628
Go on, get in bed. He's yelling
at the kids like a madman.

648
00:49:22,878 --> 00:49:26,131
Then he wants me to go on a
kiddie ride. I don't wanna go.

649
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:29,301
He starts screaming at me.
Shh. Sweetheart, shh, shh.

650
00:49:29,468 --> 00:49:32,179
He's screaming and screaming.

651
00:49:32,429 --> 00:49:35,182
I say, "What are you
gonna do with the gun?

652
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,309
Shoot me and dump me in the river?"

653
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:40,896
I mean, I was scared of him.
I never been scared of him.

654
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:44,941
His mother says we was always fighting,
the cops was always at our house.

655
00:49:45,192 --> 00:49:48,570
I hit him with a jack handle
once in the car.

656
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,073
Only I didn't even hit him,
I hit myself.

657
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:54,117
You should've seen the bruise
on my leg, from here to here.

658
00:49:54,284 --> 00:49:58,497
He'd put on his hat and coat,
he goes out the door. Shh!

659
00:49:59,748 --> 00:50:03,085
So they tell me he did it.
But I don't believe it.

660
00:50:03,251 --> 00:50:06,797
Mrs. Wortzik, please, listen to me.
They want you down at the bank.

661
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:11,301
His body functions might've done it,
but he himself, he didn't do it!

662
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:23,438
"Dear Abby: Lately I've been
dreaming about falling into water...

663
00:50:23,605 --> 00:50:26,608
...and not being able
to reach the surface.

664
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:31,238
I begin to breathe heavily
and I wake up in a cold sweat.

665
00:50:31,488 --> 00:50:35,367
A friend tells me that my problem
is one of sexual repression."

666
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,871
- Margaret, are you all right?
- No.

667
00:50:40,038 --> 00:50:43,959
<i>What are you, a renegade,
a bandit? What kind of man are you...</i>

668
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:46,878
<i>...siding with the Indians
against his own people?</i>

669
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:50,507
<i>- What's your grudge against me?
- I'm taking you in for murder, Kilgore.</i>

670
00:50:56,596 --> 00:50:57,639
Yeah?

671
00:50:57,806 --> 00:51:01,143
<i>Are you doing
anything to any of those girls in there?</i>

672
00:51:01,852 --> 00:51:03,687
He's back again.

673
00:51:04,771 --> 00:51:06,356
<i>Well?</i>

674
00:51:09,151 --> 00:51:10,444
<i>Who is this?</i>

675
00:51:11,778 --> 00:51:14,281
Sonny. Look at Margaret.

676
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:18,660
What's the matter with her?

677
00:51:19,995 --> 00:51:21,747
There's no air in here.

678
00:51:25,751 --> 00:51:28,420
What happened to the air conditioning?

679
00:51:33,425 --> 00:51:37,220
- I'm sorry, Syl.
- It's all right.

680
00:51:38,263 --> 00:51:41,725
- Where's the air conditioning?
- The basement.

681
00:51:46,146 --> 00:51:49,483
Sal, I'm gonna go
check the air conditioning.

682
00:51:49,733 --> 00:51:52,611
- I'll be right back.
- Sonny.

683
00:51:57,616 --> 00:51:59,117
What?

684
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,288
I never been up in an airplane before.

685
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:09,961
So? I mean...

686
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:15,342
I mean, it's safe. It's like a car.
It's safer than a car.

687
00:52:16,635 --> 00:52:18,011
It's....

688
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:19,846
It's all right, Sal.

689
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,855
- I'm gonna go check it now.
- Okay.

690
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:53,880
- Sal!
- What?

691
00:52:54,047 --> 00:52:56,800
- They're coming in the back!
- In the vault! Come on.

692
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,428
- Goddamn it, move!
- Back, get back.

693
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:01,847
No, don't shoot!

694
00:53:09,229 --> 00:53:12,148
That's it, Sonny! Get her in there!
Do it!

695
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,860
Get her in there!

696
00:53:16,403 --> 00:53:17,779
Who fired that shot?

697
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,074
Pick her up by the legs.

698
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:24,953
Who fired the shot?

699
00:53:26,371 --> 00:53:27,831
Come on! Move!

700
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,667
Okay, legs. I'll bring her.

701
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,169
<i>- They're moving good.</i>
- What's that?

702
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:37,424
Sonny?

703
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:40,427
Sonny! Get me a bullhorn.

704
00:53:44,764 --> 00:53:46,141
Sonny!

705
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:53,773
- You got that bullhorn?
- Right. Here.

706
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,570
Hey, Sonny.

707
00:54:00,864 --> 00:54:02,324
Come on out, Sonny.

708
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:06,202
- Sonny.
- Sonny!

709
00:54:06,369 --> 00:54:07,579
That's all I need.

710
00:54:10,206 --> 00:54:12,417
- Sonny?
- Sonny!

711
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,502
Come on, take care of that, will you?

712
00:54:15,754 --> 00:54:18,048
- Sonny, come on out.
- Sonny, come on out.

713
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:20,592
Go straighten that out,
will you, Carmine? Sonny!

714
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:23,470
Sonny, come on out.

715
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,891
- Sonny?
- You did fine.

716
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:29,643
Sonny.

717
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:34,064
Sonny!

718
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:37,525
You son of a bitch,
you wanna get those people killed?

719
00:54:37,776 --> 00:54:39,653
Come on out, Sonny.

720
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:45,241
Sonny, come on out.

721
00:54:49,162 --> 00:54:50,580
Come on out here, now.

722
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,836
Come on out, Sonny. Sonny!

723
00:55:00,882 --> 00:55:02,550
Sonny?

724
00:55:05,303 --> 00:55:07,263
Come on out here, Sonny.

725
00:55:09,265 --> 00:55:11,226
All right, I see it, Sonny. Come on.

726
00:55:11,393 --> 00:55:14,270
Come on. All right, get back.

727
00:55:18,233 --> 00:55:19,943
Wait, wait. People, wait.

728
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:25,991
Keep going.

729
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,036
What's the matter with you?

730
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:33,456
- What?
- What're you firing that shot for?

731
00:55:33,707 --> 00:55:35,208
We got 250 cops here!

732
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,711
Fuck you! What were
they doing back there?

733
00:55:37,961 --> 00:55:40,588
What the hell's
the matter with you? Huh?

734
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,465
Are we dealing?

735
00:55:42,632 --> 00:55:44,634
- They were trying to get in, right?
- Who?

736
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:47,220
Come on, don't give me that shit.
You know who.

737
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:49,514
- What's going on?
- You're full of shit!

738
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,725
Find out what's going on there!

739
00:55:51,975 --> 00:55:54,644
- Honest to God, Sonny, I don't know...
- Bullshit!

740
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,813
Communications aren't set up yet.

741
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,357
- Get someone to talk to me!
- Goddamn it.

742
00:55:59,607 --> 00:56:01,526
I'm not talking to you anymore.

743
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:04,195
- Let me talk to you.
- You say this, you do that.

744
00:56:04,446 --> 00:56:05,739
Why were they back there?!

745
00:56:06,031 --> 00:56:08,283
- I don't know!
- You're full of shit.

746
00:56:08,533 --> 00:56:10,410
That's another force, a tactical force!

747
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,204
They like to shoot,
climb through windows!

748
00:56:13,455 --> 00:56:16,374
They like that, right?
Without your orders, right?

749
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,084
No. Yes! Without my orders!

750
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:21,129
- You're not coming through the roof?
- I tell you we won't.

751
00:56:21,296 --> 00:56:24,758
You're telling me a lot of things,
but you're not doing them.

752
00:56:25,008 --> 00:56:26,259
What were they doing?!

753
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,762
- I don't know!
- You can't answer me, right?

754
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:30,472
- You can't answer me.
- What?

755
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,223
- You can't answer me.
- Yes, I can.

756
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:34,476
So tell me what they were doing.

757
00:56:34,768 --> 00:56:37,270
No communications!
I sent someone back there.

758
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,399
I got a guy in there who's gonna kill
somebody. That's your responsibility.

759
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:44,277
- Not mine, that's yours.
- Wait a minute, hold on. Let's...

760
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:46,362
- We got everything you wanted.
- Oh, yeah?

761
00:56:46,529 --> 00:56:49,616
Yeah. We can't get a helicopter in here,
but a bus is coming.

762
00:56:50,075 --> 00:56:52,911
We got a jet coming into Kennedy,
all right?

763
00:56:53,078 --> 00:56:55,330
Okay? All right?

764
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,125
Now, we got ahold of your wife.

765
00:56:59,918 --> 00:57:01,336
Your wife is coming.

766
00:57:01,503 --> 00:57:03,797
We reached her
and she's coming here, all right?

767
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:06,841
- Okay?
- Where you going? Where you going?

768
00:57:07,008 --> 00:57:09,552
I'm right here.
I thought we were gonna talk.

769
00:57:10,011 --> 00:57:11,930
I thought so too.
But we're not talking.

770
00:57:12,097 --> 00:57:13,973
We're trying to get in the back door.

771
00:57:14,224 --> 00:57:17,727
Your wife will be here
in about a half-hour. Okay?

772
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:19,938
They're still pointing.
They love to point.

773
00:57:20,188 --> 00:57:22,565
Holster that weapon!
Holster it!

774
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,526
Holster that weapon!

775
00:57:25,276 --> 00:57:26,903
You too!

776
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,031
All right, come on.

777
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:32,492
- What?
- What else do you want me to do?

778
00:57:32,742 --> 00:57:34,828
How could you do any better?

779
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:36,746
We got everything you wanted.

780
00:57:36,913 --> 00:57:39,249
I'll do anything I can
to stop anything I can.

781
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:43,211
Anything else?

782
00:57:43,461 --> 00:57:45,046
- Yeah.
- What?

783
00:57:45,296 --> 00:57:47,799
I got some people
in there that are hungry.

784
00:57:47,966 --> 00:57:50,802
- Can you get some food?
- No problem. What do you want?

785
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,637
- Want some pizzas?
- Yeah, all right.

786
00:57:52,804 --> 00:57:53,888
Pizzas?

787
00:57:54,055 --> 00:57:57,517
Hey, Carmine, get some food,
some pizzas.

788
00:57:58,184 --> 00:58:00,061
Can we get some beer, you think?

789
00:58:00,353 --> 00:58:02,981
No beer.
Let's keep it to soft drinks, all right?

790
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:05,817
Come on. All right? Carmine...

791
00:58:05,984 --> 00:58:08,611
...some soft drinks too, okay?
Cokes.

792
00:58:08,862 --> 00:58:10,738
- What else?
- I need some aspirin too.

793
00:58:10,989 --> 00:58:12,448
Some lady's not feeling well.

794
00:58:13,158 --> 00:58:14,993
You got it. Anything else?

795
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:19,205
- Just don't fucking con me.
- I'm not. Why would I wanna do that?

796
00:58:19,372 --> 00:58:23,418
I'm in trouble enough as it is.
I'm not trying to create any trouble.

797
00:58:24,002 --> 00:58:25,336
All right?

798
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,137
It's okay.

799
00:58:38,183 --> 00:58:41,394
They can't... They can't bring
a helicopter in here, Sal.

800
00:58:41,561 --> 00:58:43,313
Because they can't land it here.

801
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:46,941
But they're gonna get us a limo bus...
A big bus so we can all get in.

802
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,068
And that's how we get to the airport.

803
00:58:50,236 --> 00:58:51,946
It's good. It looks good.

804
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:58,828
You people,
I just ordered you some food, so....

805
00:58:58,995 --> 00:59:01,080
I even got her some aspirins.

806
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,333
Okay? So we're moving it along now.

807
00:59:03,875 --> 00:59:07,045
I gotta pay for the food.
Where's the marked fives?

808
00:59:07,295 --> 00:59:09,964
That was a foolish thing
you did back there.

809
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,885
Yeah? Foolish thing.

810
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:19,098
We gonna get the ball rolling?

811
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:21,893
Yeah, what do you think I'm doing?

812
00:59:22,143 --> 00:59:24,312
I'm working on it, right?
What's it look like?

813
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,856
You think it's easy?
I gotta keep them cool.

814
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,858
I gotta keep all you people happy.

815
00:59:29,108 --> 00:59:31,361
I gotta have all the ideas
and do it all alone.

816
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:33,279
I'm working on it.
You wanna try it?

817
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,157
Your food is here, Sonny.

818
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,702
You're starting to get on my nerves.

819
00:59:48,253 --> 00:59:52,548
All right. Go on with him there.
You'll be all right. Go right here.

820
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:58,054
- What do I owe you?
- It's all paid for.

821
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:59,722
- It's paid for.
- I paid for it.

822
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:01,474
No, I got it. I got it.

823
01:00:02,016 --> 01:00:04,644
Here. Keep the change.

824
01:00:08,147 --> 01:00:09,482
What?

825
01:00:11,985 --> 01:00:13,695
- You want this?
- Yeah!

826
01:00:17,156 --> 01:00:18,199
You like it?

827
01:00:28,376 --> 01:00:30,503
Moretti, could you use five?

828
01:00:38,845 --> 01:00:41,014
I got a lot for you.

829
01:00:50,231 --> 01:00:51,566
Get back!

830
01:00:51,733 --> 01:00:55,695
Get back, goddamn it! Get back!

831
01:00:56,904 --> 01:01:00,033
Let him go. Let him go.

832
01:01:11,586 --> 01:01:15,423
<i>More! More! More!</i>

833
01:01:15,590 --> 01:01:19,761
<i>More! More! More!</i>

834
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,059
Could you open it?

835
01:01:27,352 --> 01:01:28,770
Thank you, man.

836
01:01:29,562 --> 01:01:31,272
See you later.

837
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:35,693
I'm a fucking star!

838
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:01,427
- Okay, kick...
- Right.

839
01:02:01,594 --> 01:02:03,596
- ...out, turn.
- Around.

840
01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:08,226
No, just pick her up and hold her.
She'll be okay.

841
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:11,687
You're getting your kick good. Here.

842
01:02:20,446 --> 01:02:23,116
Kick, out....

843
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:24,826
This is where it gets stuck.

844
01:02:26,661 --> 01:02:28,830
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

845
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:30,081
Here.

846
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:32,500
Miriam's making a fool of herself.

847
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,293
Out.

848
01:02:34,544 --> 01:02:37,755
- Anybody got a cigarette?
- Yeah, I do.

849
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:39,507
Sylvia, you don't smoke.

850
01:02:41,843 --> 01:02:43,636
You don't smoke?

851
01:02:44,554 --> 01:02:45,972
No.

852
01:02:47,223 --> 01:02:49,142
Why...? Why do you wanna start now?

853
01:02:49,434 --> 01:02:52,311
I'm scared to death, that's why.
What, you don't smoke?

854
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:55,314
- No.
- How come?

855
01:03:00,445 --> 01:03:02,697
- I don't want the cancer.
- Oh, my God.

856
01:03:02,989 --> 01:03:06,409
- Give me the cigarette.
- Go ahead, do what you want.

857
01:03:08,035 --> 01:03:10,413
I just think you ought to
take care of your body.

858
01:03:10,663 --> 01:03:13,749
My body? What for?

859
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:18,254
The body is the temple of the Lord.

860
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:22,216
You're serious.

861
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:26,971
So you rob a bank...

862
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:30,850
...but you keep your body pure.
Is that it?

863
01:03:35,688 --> 01:03:37,482
You gonna smoke or what?

864
01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:41,194
Yes.

865
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:43,988
If I die of cancer,
it'll be half your fault.

866
01:03:49,368 --> 01:03:53,581
- No, it's because you're weak.
- Right, I'm weak.

867
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,335
- One, two, three...
- Where's your bullets?

868
01:03:57,502 --> 01:03:58,753
Mulvaney speaking.

869
01:04:01,631 --> 01:04:03,090
It's Moretti.

870
01:04:04,634 --> 01:04:06,469
Wants to talk to you.

871
01:04:07,845 --> 01:04:08,846
Yeah.

872
01:04:09,013 --> 01:04:10,848
<i>Will you guys hold it down back there?</i>

873
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:13,142
<i>Sonny, they're bringing in your wife.</i>

874
01:04:27,114 --> 01:04:29,492
Step back. Stay back.

875
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:32,370
- Where's Moretti?
- Probably in the bar.

876
01:04:40,253 --> 01:04:42,713
In the barbershop.

877
01:04:45,258 --> 01:04:46,801
What's that?

878
01:04:47,718 --> 01:04:49,762
We went to Bellevue
where you told us...

879
01:04:50,012 --> 01:04:51,430
...said he was his wife.

880
01:04:51,681 --> 01:04:53,432
They were married in a church.

881
01:04:53,724 --> 01:04:55,142
Jesus Christ!

882
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:56,894
Leon.

883
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,149
Leon!

884
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,402
Hey, Leon, over here!

885
01:05:04,902 --> 01:05:07,196
Leon! Hey, Leon!

886
01:05:07,363 --> 01:05:10,032
- Now move it back.
- Leon, over here!

887
01:05:10,283 --> 01:05:13,035
Leon! Happy birthday!

888
01:05:22,753 --> 01:05:25,172
- Hey, give us some room, huh?
- Watch his head.

889
01:05:29,927 --> 01:05:31,470
He's a queer?

890
01:05:31,804 --> 01:05:34,724
Sarge. Sarge, he wants you!

891
01:05:36,142 --> 01:05:39,312
Come on, get the shield out of here.
I don't need it now.

892
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:41,856
Where were you four hours ago,
when I needed it?

893
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:44,567
He's not gonna shoot.
Yeah, Sonny, what?

894
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,986
What happened? Is he all right?

895
01:05:47,236 --> 01:05:50,573
- He's a little groggy right now, okay?
- No, let me talk to him.

896
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:54,035
Let me get him on his feet and
call you back. Shut the fucking door.

897
01:05:58,247 --> 01:06:01,250
Stop the noise in here. I don't wanna
hear a fucking sound! Typewriter!

898
01:06:02,126 --> 01:06:04,170
- Get off the fucking phone!
- Sarge.

899
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:05,921
Now!

900
01:06:06,756 --> 01:06:08,674
Give me some water, all right?

901
01:06:11,177 --> 01:06:13,846
Leon? Leon.

902
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:18,434
You all right, Leon? They give you a shot
down at the hospital or something?

903
01:06:19,477 --> 01:06:22,563
Oh, God.
They shot me with, like, unreal!

904
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,607
You gotta get ahold of yourself...

905
01:06:25,066 --> 01:06:28,194
...so you can talk to him,
see if he'll come out of the bank.

906
01:06:28,361 --> 01:06:29,779
Oh, no.

907
01:06:29,945 --> 01:06:32,615
He's got eight people, and a kid
named Sal. You know him?

908
01:06:32,948 --> 01:06:36,285
- No, not really.
- Says he's gonna shoot these eight people.

909
01:06:36,494 --> 01:06:40,039
I can't help it.
I can't stop him from anything.

910
01:06:40,331 --> 01:06:41,999
Who will he listen to, then?

911
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:45,169
I can't... I can't talk to him.
He won't listen to anybody.

912
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:48,005
He's been...
He's been crazy all summer.

913
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:51,133
He's tried to kill me since June.

914
01:06:52,635 --> 01:06:56,013
Yeah. Put a gun to my head.
And he cut me with a knife.

915
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:59,141
- He beat up my friends.
- Did you contact the police?

916
01:06:59,308 --> 01:07:02,019
Well.... What good would that do?

917
01:07:02,353 --> 01:07:06,190
It'd just make him mad. They don't
know him. And it wouldn't stop him.

918
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,820
- Somebody's gotta stop him.
- You don't understand. He's crazy.

919
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:16,450
He's got a wife, children.

920
01:07:17,743 --> 01:07:19,745
He's a wonderful father.

921
01:07:20,621 --> 01:07:21,706
His mother...

922
01:07:21,872 --> 01:07:26,127
...you should see her. Together with
his father, they're like a car wreck.

923
01:07:27,128 --> 01:07:29,547
It just... It just rolls off his back.

924
01:07:29,797 --> 01:07:32,842
He sees them.
He pays the rent. Unbelievable.

925
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:38,848
I was the one who wanted to get
married. He didn't really want it...

926
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:41,726
...but he did it.
I don't know why.

927
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:44,311
Why did you wanna get married?

928
01:07:48,315 --> 01:07:50,526
I thought it would help me.

929
01:07:51,277 --> 01:07:54,321
But, uh.... But it didn't.

930
01:07:54,697 --> 01:07:57,992
I... I was so confused.
I was doing...

931
01:07:58,159 --> 01:07:59,744
...insane things.

932
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,371
What sort of things, Leon?

933
01:08:07,209 --> 01:08:08,836
After the wedding...

934
01:08:09,545 --> 01:08:12,548
...I ran off for 10 days
to Atlantic City.

935
01:08:13,507 --> 01:08:15,676
Sonny was frantic.

936
01:08:15,843 --> 01:08:20,014
He knew I'd been drinking. He didn't
know where I was, who I was with.

937
01:08:21,182 --> 01:08:24,310
I couldn't explain the things I did.

938
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:26,854
So I went to a psychiatrist...

939
01:08:27,188 --> 01:08:28,731
...who told me...

940
01:08:29,356 --> 01:08:33,360
...that I was a woman
trapped in a man's body.

941
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:44,830
So right away Sonny wanted to give me
money for the sex-change operation.

942
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,041
But where was he gonna get it?

943
01:08:47,291 --> 01:08:49,794
$2500?

944
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,713
My God, he was in hock
up to his ears already.

945
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,799
He needed the money
for your operation?

946
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:58,093
It drove him crazy. He...

947
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,721
He would fly into these rages.

948
01:09:01,597 --> 01:09:03,808
And I got more depressed than ever.

949
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:06,560
I knew I'd never get my operation.

950
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:08,687
So I, uh....

951
01:09:09,438 --> 01:09:13,317
I tried to kill myself.
I took about a half a pound of pills.

952
01:09:13,484 --> 01:09:17,988
Blues, reds, yellows, screamers,
uppers, downers, you name it.

953
01:09:18,572 --> 01:09:20,407
And I wound up in a hospital.

954
01:09:20,574 --> 01:09:22,451
And, uh...

955
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:24,745
...Sonny comes there...

956
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,206
...and he just looks at me.

957
01:09:28,374 --> 01:09:30,042
And he says:

958
01:09:30,292 --> 01:09:32,253
"Why, Leon?

959
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,214
When things were going so good?"

960
01:09:39,844 --> 01:09:41,720
Don't you think...?

961
01:09:42,304 --> 01:09:45,558
Leon, don't you think
he sort of did it for you?

962
01:09:49,186 --> 01:09:51,188
Yeah, I guess so.

963
01:09:52,857 --> 01:09:55,776
Don't you think you owe it to him
to try to get him out?

964
01:09:57,278 --> 01:09:59,405
I can't talk to him.

965
01:10:01,448 --> 01:10:04,702
You're up to your neck in it, Leon.
You're an accessory.

966
01:10:05,119 --> 01:10:09,999
- No, no. They can't hold me responsible.
- Wait, you could help us a little.

967
01:10:10,374 --> 01:10:11,417
I'm afraid.

968
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:15,087
Just talk to him for a minute.
How can he hurt you on the phone?

969
01:10:16,213 --> 01:10:20,593
- All you're gonna be is on the phone.
- I can't. I don't know what to....

970
01:10:20,843 --> 01:10:23,971
- Just talk with him on the phone.
- I can't. No.

971
01:10:25,639 --> 01:10:27,641
I can't.

972
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,021
You think about it, Leon.

973
01:10:33,397 --> 01:10:34,440
Yeah.

974
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:42,698
- He doesn't wanna talk to you.
- What do you mean, won't talk to me?

975
01:10:43,741 --> 01:10:46,577
- Let me work on it.
- I thought you were doing that.

976
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:57,421
He don't wanna talk to me.

977
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,313
<i>Police are questioning Leon Shermer...</i>

Sonny. Sonny, they said,
"Two homosexuals in the bank."

998
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:35,644
- Right on TV. You hear?
- What difference does it make?

999
01:12:35,811 --> 01:12:39,273
They're gonna say anything they want.
Let them say it.

1000
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:45,779
Well, I'm not a homosexual.

1001
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:52,703
Tell them to get that right.
That's going out on the TV.

1002
01:12:56,957 --> 01:13:01,545
Sal, what am I supposed to do? I can't
control what they say on television.

1003
01:13:03,172 --> 01:13:06,592
What should I do? I'm doing
everything I can. I can't do that.

1004
01:13:07,342 --> 01:13:08,886
I mean, they're...

1005
01:13:11,180 --> 01:13:12,806
Look, Sal.

1006
01:13:13,265 --> 01:13:17,352
Forget about it. It's just a freak show
to them, anyway. It don't matter.

1007
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,354
Whatever they say, it don't matter.

1008
01:13:25,527 --> 01:13:27,112
It'll be all right.

1009
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:38,040
What's the matter with you?

1010
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:42,628
You shouldn't let something like that
spoil your fun, you know?

1011
01:13:42,795 --> 01:13:44,963
You gotta get fun out of life.

1012
01:13:50,427 --> 01:13:51,637
Shit.

1013
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:53,847
Where's the goddamn jet?

1014
01:13:54,890 --> 01:13:57,726
They're always screaming overhead,
going somewhere...

1015
01:13:57,893 --> 01:14:00,062
...when you don't need them,
you know?

1016
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:28,048
What are you gonna tell the pilot
when you get on the plane?

1017
01:14:29,299 --> 01:14:31,093
You have to know, right?

1018
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:33,470
- Did you know Holland's pretty good?
- Use this.

1019
01:14:33,720 --> 01:14:37,266
- Holland?
- They sheltered people during the war.

1020
01:14:37,891 --> 01:14:39,643
They're good people.

1021
01:14:39,852 --> 01:14:41,311
Where's Holland?

1022
01:14:41,562 --> 01:14:44,189
- It's right up....
- It's over there.

1023
01:14:47,526 --> 01:14:48,861
She doesn't have a map.

1024
01:14:49,027 --> 01:14:51,238
It's got good chocolate.

1025
01:14:53,657 --> 01:14:56,160
Come on, get in the vault.
Get in the vault. Come on.

1026
01:14:56,326 --> 01:14:57,369
Quickly!

1027
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:12,342
They're waiting for us
to do something, I think.

1028
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:17,389
Sonny.

1029
01:15:18,849 --> 01:15:21,602
- Come on out for a second, please.
- It's him, Sonny.

1030
01:15:22,019 --> 01:15:24,479
Come on out here.
I wanna talk to you a second.

1031
01:15:27,232 --> 01:15:29,443
- Come on, Sonny.
- Sonny.

1032
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:38,660
Sonny.

1033
01:15:39,411 --> 01:15:40,996
Come on out, Sonny.

1034
01:15:42,122 --> 01:15:43,624
Sonny?

1035
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:50,214
Come on out a minute.

1036
01:15:51,298 --> 01:15:52,925
That's it, Sonny.

1037
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:01,141
Hey, Sonny!

1038
01:16:05,395 --> 01:16:06,438
Moretti!

1039
01:16:09,107 --> 01:16:13,278
What the fuck is going on?
Get the lights back on.

1040
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:15,322
Moretti!

1041
01:16:16,949 --> 01:16:17,991
Who are you?

1042
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,328
FBI, Sheldon.

1043
01:16:23,914 --> 01:16:25,666
Oh, good.

1044
01:16:25,832 --> 01:16:28,835
About time. Maybe we can
get this thing started, huh?

1045
01:16:29,002 --> 01:16:30,796
Look, get the lights back on...

1046
01:16:30,963 --> 01:16:34,216
...and the air conditioner.
We got no air conditioning.

1047
01:16:34,466 --> 01:16:38,053
- No more favors. That's all over, Sonny.
- Favors?

1048
01:16:38,387 --> 01:16:40,681
You been doing me favors all night?

1049
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:45,227
I have a jet, limo will be here
in a half hour.

1050
01:16:47,104 --> 01:16:49,314
I want the hostages.

1051
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:51,733
No, no, no. Bullshit.

1052
01:16:52,526 --> 01:16:55,028
I'd like to work with you on this,
not against you.

1053
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:57,531
The hostages are
what's keeping me alive.

1054
01:16:59,658 --> 01:17:00,951
When do I get them?

1055
01:17:02,703 --> 01:17:04,288
Didn't they tell you anything?

1056
01:17:06,206 --> 01:17:08,125
I'd like to hear it from you.

1057
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:14,381
You get one hostage for the
limousine that you bring me in.

1058
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:18,010
One hos... One hostage for the jet.

1059
01:17:18,468 --> 01:17:21,888
Then I get to the airport.
I go into the plane, check it all out.

1060
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:24,683
And if it's okay,
then they all come out.

1061
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,146
- I wanna go inside.
- Why?

1062
01:17:29,396 --> 01:17:32,733
- To see if everybody's all right.
- They're all right.

1063
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,609
No, I have to see.

1064
01:17:42,034 --> 01:17:43,577
Oh....

1065
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:45,203
You got guts.

1066
01:17:45,454 --> 01:17:48,707
Think if we slit their throats,
we're gonna let you out?

1067
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:50,709
I have to see.

1068
01:18:02,179 --> 01:18:04,306
I gotta check with my partner.

1069
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,232
The FBI, Sal. They're coming in.

1070
01:18:20,572 --> 01:18:22,574
Hey, pussycat. There you go.

1071
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:32,250
You'd like to kill me?
Bet you would.

1072
01:18:32,501 --> 01:18:35,712
I wouldn't like to kill you.
I will if I have to.

1073
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:37,881
It's your job, right?

1074
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:40,675
The guy who kills me...

1075
01:18:40,926 --> 01:18:45,138
...I hope he does it because he hates
my guts, not because it's his job.

1076
01:18:51,728 --> 01:18:54,856
Nobody give your right name.
It's the FBI.

1077
01:19:06,451 --> 01:19:09,996
Just wanna make sure all you
young ladies are all right in here.

1078
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:11,456
- Look...
- We're all right.

1079
01:19:11,623 --> 01:19:14,751
...they asked for the jet hours ago.
Now, what are you doing?

1080
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:18,213
That's being set up.
We'll have you out in a couple of hours.

1081
01:19:18,422 --> 01:19:21,591
- A couple of hours?
- Why not give them what they want?

1082
01:19:21,758 --> 01:19:24,719
They'll get what they want.
We wanna be sure we get what we want.

1083
01:19:24,886 --> 01:19:27,848
That's to get you all out of here safe.

1084
01:19:29,516 --> 01:19:30,851
You two boys too.

1085
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:32,477
That's close enough.

1086
01:19:36,231 --> 01:19:39,568
Tell the TV to stop saying
there's two homosexuals in here.

1087
01:19:40,694 --> 01:19:42,571
I will, Sal.

1088
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:46,616
Outside for a minute, Sonny?

1089
01:20:11,766 --> 01:20:13,351
You handle yourself well, Sonny.

1090
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:17,856
A lot of men would have choked.
We might have had a death on our hands.

1091
01:20:18,106 --> 01:20:20,567
But you handled it. I respect that.

1092
01:20:21,318 --> 01:20:24,362
Now, don't you try to take Sal.
We'll handle him.

1093
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,201
- Just sit tight and you won't get hurt.
- Wait. What are you talking about?

1094
01:20:30,994 --> 01:20:32,829
You just sit quiet.

1095
01:20:34,372 --> 01:20:36,166
We'll handle Sal.

1096
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:42,172
You think I'd sell him out, you fuck?

1097
01:20:59,064 --> 01:21:00,607
What'd he say?

1098
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,903
He was just talking
about arrangements.

1099
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:08,073
I talked to him about the TV, Sal.
It's gonna be all right.

1100
01:21:08,949 --> 01:21:09,991
That's all?

1101
01:21:10,909 --> 01:21:12,202
Yeah.

1102
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,914
Why couldn't he say that in here?

1103
01:21:16,957 --> 01:21:21,628
I don't know. He wanted to show me
how the bus is coming in.

1104
01:21:32,556 --> 01:21:33,598
What's the matter?

1105
01:21:34,808 --> 01:21:36,935
Somebody get a glass of water.

1106
01:21:39,187 --> 01:21:40,897
Got a hankie?

1107
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:43,316
They poisoned the pizza.

1108
01:21:43,525 --> 01:21:47,153
It's not the pizza. He's got diabetes.

1109
01:21:48,113 --> 01:21:51,783
He had some Coke before.
Don't give him anything. I'll hold it.

1110
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:55,579
What can we do for you,
Mr. Mulvaney? Tell us.

1111
01:22:00,375 --> 01:22:02,544
Is there a doctor out here?

1112
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:07,757
We need a doctor in here.

1113
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:12,137
We need a doctor.

1114
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:16,516
- What's wrong?
- The manager, he's diabetic.

1115
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:18,268
He don't look good.

1116
01:22:31,948 --> 01:22:33,491
I gotta search you.

1117
01:22:37,078 --> 01:22:39,205
Watch out he don't kiss you, doc.

1118
01:22:40,582 --> 01:22:42,834
Looking for an antonym.

1119
01:22:44,753 --> 01:22:46,171
Okay.

1120
01:22:52,093 --> 01:22:53,428
Just him.

1121
01:22:54,846 --> 01:22:56,222
Sonny.

1122
01:22:57,515 --> 01:23:01,353
I've convinced Leon to talk to you.
He's on the phone now.

1123
01:23:15,033 --> 01:23:16,576
He's coming on.

1124
01:23:17,410 --> 01:23:19,412
Shh, shh, shh.

1125
01:23:25,293 --> 01:23:26,378
Hello.

1126
01:23:27,462 --> 01:23:28,838
<i>Hello?</i>

1127
01:23:29,172 --> 01:23:30,590
<i>Hello, Leon?</i>

1128
01:23:31,007 --> 01:23:33,551
Hello. Hello, Sonny.

1129
01:23:34,135 --> 01:23:35,512
What happened?

1130
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:37,847
How you...? How you doing?

1131
01:23:38,306 --> 01:23:41,226
Well, I'm out of the hospital.

1132
01:23:41,393 --> 01:23:44,896
Yeah, I know. You know,
I thought you'd never get out.

1133
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:49,109
Hot. I never thought
I'd get out this way, I'll tell you.

1134
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:50,819
Yeah.

1135
01:23:51,319 --> 01:23:52,946
So how you doing?

1136
01:23:54,114 --> 01:23:57,242
<i>- Uh, I'm a little shaky.</i>
- Oh, yeah?

1137
01:23:57,409 --> 01:24:00,787
Moretti told me that you were
all drugged up...

1138
01:24:01,788 --> 01:24:06,459
...so I figured that's why you didn't
talk to me. I was wondering why.

1139
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:08,378
It was really terrible, you know?

1140
01:24:08,628 --> 01:24:11,881
I mean, you walk in, and right away
they say you're crazy.

1141
01:24:12,048 --> 01:24:14,259
And then they start sticking
things in your arm.

1142
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:19,639
I mean, how do they expect you to get
uncrazy if you're asleep all the time?

1143
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:24,978
I'm... I'm just starting
to come out of it now.

1144
01:24:25,145 --> 01:24:28,773
- So....
<i>- So how are you?</i>

1145
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:30,400
I'm fine.

1146
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:34,279
This is something, huh?

1147
01:24:39,159 --> 01:24:40,827
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

1148
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:44,497
I don't know, Leon, you know?
I'm dying here.

1149
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:46,458
I'm dying.

1150
01:24:48,126 --> 01:24:51,337
Don't you ever listen to yourself
when you say you're dying?

1151
01:24:51,588 --> 01:24:54,716
<i>- Did you ever listen to yourself?</i>
- What are you talking...?

1152
01:24:54,966 --> 01:24:58,470
What do you mean, what am I
talking about? You're dying.

1153
01:24:58,678 --> 01:25:02,599
Do you know that you say that
to me every day? "I'm dying."

1154
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:05,727
You're not dying.
You're killing the people around you.

1155
01:25:05,977 --> 01:25:09,439
Leon, don't give me that shit.
I don't need the deep shit now!

1156
01:25:09,689 --> 01:25:12,150
You don't realize what
the things you do mean.

1157
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,903
Yeah? I know what I do.

1158
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:17,071
<i>You stick a gun to somebody's head.</i>

1159
01:25:17,322 --> 01:25:21,034
- I don't know what I'm doing sometimes.
<i>- Obviously, you don't.</i>

1160
01:25:21,284 --> 01:25:23,578
"Go to sleep
so it won't hurt when I shoot."

1161
01:25:24,496 --> 01:25:27,123
<i>What do you think
I've been doing in the hospital?</i>

1162
01:25:27,332 --> 01:25:30,001
I take a handful of pills
to get away from you.

1163
01:25:30,168 --> 01:25:31,795
- Right?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1164
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:34,506
So now I'm talking to you
on the phone again, right?

1165
01:25:34,756 --> 01:25:37,467
I... I... I got no job.
I don't have friends.

1166
01:25:37,717 --> 01:25:40,386
I can't live.
I have to live with people.

1167
01:25:42,263 --> 01:25:44,140
This death business, I'm sorry.

1168
01:25:44,390 --> 01:25:47,519
I don't know what I'm getting here
with that shit.

1169
01:25:47,685 --> 01:25:51,856
You know, what am I supposed
to say to that shit? This is going on.

1170
01:25:52,106 --> 01:25:54,567
<i>- And you're giving me that shit.</i>
- I'm sorry.

1171
01:25:54,776 --> 01:25:56,486
You know what's happening with me.

1172
01:25:56,736 --> 01:25:59,364
You know the pressures
I've been having, right?

1173
01:25:59,614 --> 01:26:02,909
I got all these pressures. You know it.
You're in that hospital...

1174
01:26:03,159 --> 01:26:06,329
...with them tubes coming out
and want that operation, right?

1175
01:26:06,538 --> 01:26:09,165
You're giving me that shit.
Everybody's giving me shit.

1176
01:26:09,332 --> 01:26:14,087
Everybody needs money.
So you needed money? I got you money.

1177
01:26:14,337 --> 01:26:18,091
- I didn't ask you to rob a bank!
- I know you didn't ask me.

1178
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:22,428
Look, I'm not putting this
on anybody, you know?

1179
01:26:22,679 --> 01:26:25,640
Nothing on nobody.
I did this on my own. You see?

1180
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:29,102
All on my own, I did it.
But I just want you to know something.

1181
01:26:29,269 --> 01:26:32,438
I want you to know
that I'm getting out of here.

1182
01:26:32,689 --> 01:26:34,816
I'm getting a plane out of here...

1183
01:26:34,983 --> 01:26:38,903
...and I just wanted you to know it.
And I wanted you to come down...

1184
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:42,115
...and I wanted to just say
goodbye to you.

1185
01:26:42,365 --> 01:26:45,660
Or, if you wanted to,
you can come with me.

1186
01:26:45,910 --> 01:26:48,580
You're free to do what you want.
That's just what...

1187
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,748
<i>...I wanted to say to you, that's all.</i>

1188
01:26:52,917 --> 01:26:55,253
- I'm... I'm free to do what I want, huh?
<i>- Right.</i>

1189
01:26:55,503 --> 01:27:00,300
I been trying to get away from you for
months and I'm going with you on a trip?

1190
01:27:00,550 --> 01:27:02,552
Where? Where are you going?

1191
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:06,890
I don't know where yet.
We said Algeria. I don't know.

1192
01:27:07,140 --> 01:27:09,183
So I'll go to Algeria.
I don't know yet.

1193
01:27:09,434 --> 01:27:11,978
Why are you going to Algeria?

1194
01:27:13,605 --> 01:27:16,608
I don't know why. They got
a Howard Johnson's there.

1195
01:27:16,774 --> 01:27:19,694
Howard Johnson's. You're warped,
you know? You're really warped.

1196
01:27:19,903 --> 01:27:22,322
<i>I'm warped. I know I'm warped.</i>

1197
01:27:22,614 --> 01:27:25,199
God, Algeria. It's...

1198
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:31,080
You know, they walk around
with masks on, things on their heads.

1199
01:27:31,331 --> 01:27:34,500
- They're a bunch of crazy people.
<i>- What am I supposed to do?</i>

1200
01:27:34,751 --> 01:27:37,879
- You could have picked a better place.
<i>- Like where?</i>

1201
01:27:38,129 --> 01:27:39,964
<i>Sweden? Denmark?</i>

1202
01:27:42,383 --> 01:27:44,677
Yeah, I like that. Yeah.

1203
01:27:46,471 --> 01:27:49,599
You know what?
Sal wanted to go to Wyoming.

1204
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:53,895
I had to tell him it's not a country.
He don't know where Wyoming is.

1205
01:27:54,228 --> 01:27:57,815
I'm with a guy who don't know where
Wyoming is. Think you got problems?

1206
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,484
Phew.

1207
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:01,152
So, uh....

1208
01:28:01,319 --> 01:28:03,071
So Sal is with you?

1209
01:28:03,321 --> 01:28:06,783
<i>Oh, boy.
You'd be better off giving up.</i>

1210
01:28:07,825 --> 01:28:11,162
I'm not giving up, because
why have I done this so far?

1211
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:15,208
I've gone so far with this,
and why should I give up now?

1212
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:17,293
I can't give up.

1213
01:28:20,129 --> 01:28:23,883
<i>- Would you do me a favor then?</i>
- Yeah, what?

1214
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:30,431
These guys that have me
down here, you know...

1215
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:34,519
...they think I'm part of the plot
to rob the bank.

1216
01:28:34,686 --> 01:28:37,730
That's crazy, Leon. That's crazy.

1217
01:28:37,897 --> 01:28:40,358
They're bullshitting you,
giving you a snow job.

1218
01:28:40,608 --> 01:28:43,236
- They told me I was an accessory.
<i>- No.</i>

1219
01:28:43,486 --> 01:28:46,239
<i>That's just a con job on you.
Don't listen to that.</i>

1220
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:50,535
I have to listen to it.
I can't survive in prison, Sonny.

1221
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:53,413
- Leon, you're not going to prison.
<i>- How do you know?</i>

1222
01:28:53,663 --> 01:28:55,498
Because I know. Believe me.

1223
01:28:55,665 --> 01:28:58,042
- Look, please, just tell them.
<i>- Please what?</i>

1224
01:28:58,334 --> 01:28:59,752
Tell them what?

1225
01:29:00,003 --> 01:29:03,965
That you didn't do it?
Are they on the phone now?

1226
01:29:04,132 --> 01:29:06,426
- Are they on the phone now?
- Yeah.

1227
01:29:06,718 --> 01:29:09,345
That's great, Leon.
That's really terrific.

1228
01:29:09,637 --> 01:29:12,181
<i>You talk to me with them on the phone.
Really smart.</i>

1229
01:29:12,432 --> 01:29:14,308
- I have no choice!
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

1230
01:29:14,559 --> 01:29:18,479
What am I supposed to do? There's
7000 fucking cops all around me.

1231
01:29:18,730 --> 01:29:20,690
- Who's on now?
<i>- Look, don't lay it on me!</i>

1232
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:23,985
I'm not, but you knew
that was going on, right?

1233
01:29:24,235 --> 01:29:26,195
<i>You knew what was happening, right?</i>

1234
01:29:26,446 --> 01:29:27,697
Yeah!

1235
01:29:27,947 --> 01:29:30,158
I wanna know
who's on the phone now.

1236
01:29:32,452 --> 01:29:34,579
Moretti. Moretti, is that you?

1237
01:29:36,122 --> 01:29:37,623
<i>Hello.</i>

1238
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:42,754
Will somebody talk to me?
Somebody gonna talk to me or what?

1239
01:29:43,004 --> 01:29:46,174
- They on the phone now?
- They won't talk to you.

1240
01:29:46,924 --> 01:29:50,762
All right. He didn't do it, okay?
He had nothing to do with it.

1241
01:29:52,138 --> 01:29:54,891
<i>All right. Now, will you get
the fuck off the phone?</i>

1242
01:29:55,058 --> 01:29:56,642
Are they off the phone?

1243
01:30:00,188 --> 01:30:01,230
Yeah.

1244
01:30:01,397 --> 01:30:04,859
Terrific. That really convinced them.
That's what they wanted to know.

1245
01:30:05,026 --> 01:30:06,986
- Did I do it for you?
- Yeah, thank...

1246
01:30:07,153 --> 01:30:08,404
- Thank you very much.
<i>- Okay.</i>

1247
01:30:10,448 --> 01:30:12,575
So now what?
What are you gonna do?

1248
01:30:13,201 --> 01:30:14,994
Well, I thought...

1249
01:30:16,370 --> 01:30:18,498
...that I would
go back to the hospital.

1250
01:30:18,748 --> 01:30:22,877
They're really nice there.
They seem like they're trying to help me.

1251
01:30:23,336 --> 01:30:25,421
That's good, then.
You found something.

1252
01:30:26,214 --> 01:30:28,216
Yeah, I don't know if I have or not.

1253
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:32,303
So are you gonna still
have the operation?

1254
01:30:32,553 --> 01:30:35,056
Yeah. Yeah.

1255
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:38,893
So then, what am I
supposed to say to you?

1256
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:47,527
Thanks a lot...

1257
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:49,946
...and bon voyage.

1258
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:53,366
Yeah, right. See you sometime.

1259
01:30:53,574 --> 01:30:56,327
Yeah. I'll see you in my dreams, huh?

1260
01:30:56,577 --> 01:30:58,037
<i>Right, I'll write a song.</i>

1261
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:06,379
- I don't know. Life's so funny.
<i>- You said a mouthful, sweetheart.</i>

1262
01:31:11,509 --> 01:31:13,511
Well... Goodbye, huh?

1263
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,432
Bye.

1264
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:46,294
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Give me... Can I have...?

1265
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:48,796
<i>- Moretti. Moretti.</i>
- Hey. Hey.

1266
01:31:48,963 --> 01:31:52,008
You cut off the incoming calls.
Can I have a line?

1267
01:31:52,175 --> 01:31:54,635
I wanna talk to my wife
and to my kids.

1268
01:31:54,886 --> 01:31:57,221
<i>He wants an outside line,
is it all right?</i>

1269
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:01,350
- Hey. I want a line.
<i>- Yeah, Sonny, I'm getting it.</i>

1270
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:06,439
I could call anybody,
they'd put them on the phone.

1271
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:08,816
The pope, an astronaut...

1272
01:32:10,151 --> 01:32:11,861
...the wisest of the wise.

1273
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:15,156
Who do I have to call?

1274
01:32:17,283 --> 01:32:19,577
I just don't know what to do.

1275
01:32:26,626 --> 01:32:28,419
- Hello.
<i>- Angie.</i>

1276
01:32:28,586 --> 01:32:31,130
Sonny, Jesus!
I was watching it on TV.

1277
01:32:31,297 --> 01:32:35,301
<i>- Yeah. So where are the kids?</i>
- I sent them to the neighbors.

1278
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,764
I can't believe. I can't believe.
I mean, it ain't like you.

1279
01:32:39,972 --> 01:32:41,015
I know.

1280
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:43,976
<i>You've never done anything
like it before in your life.</i>

1281
01:32:44,227 --> 01:32:46,854
I'm dying, you know that?
I'm dying here.

1282
01:32:47,104 --> 01:32:51,776
<i>I blame myself. I notice you been tense,
like something is happening.</i>

1283
01:32:52,026 --> 01:32:55,112
<i>Like that night you're yelling
at the kids like a madman.</i>

1284
01:32:55,363 --> 01:32:56,864
<i>Then you want me to go...</i>

1285
01:32:57,114 --> 01:32:59,825
...on that ride, here to there,
full of those kids.

1286
01:33:00,076 --> 01:33:03,454
It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go,
so you yell at me:

1287
01:33:03,704 --> 01:33:08,000
"You pig, get on the fucking ride!"
Everything fell out of me.

1288
01:33:08,251 --> 01:33:11,629
<i>My heart, my liver just fell to the floor.
I mean, everything.</i>

1289
01:33:11,879 --> 01:33:16,509
You know what it felt like? You yelling
at me in front of all those people?

1290
01:33:16,759 --> 01:33:19,053
<i>You never talked to me
like that before, Sonny.</i>

1291
01:33:19,303 --> 01:33:22,056
I think, "He's gonna shoot me,
dump my body in the river."

1292
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:24,809
<i>- Will you just shut up?</i>
- I was scared of you!

1293
01:33:25,184 --> 01:33:29,647
Will you shut the fuck up
and listen to me?! Just listen to me!

1294
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:32,191
You see that?
With the language and everything.

1295
01:33:32,441 --> 01:33:34,819
I'm trying to talk to you, and you...

1296
01:33:35,069 --> 01:33:36,821
A person can't communicate with you!

1297
01:33:37,071 --> 01:33:40,741
I mean, what am I here?
I'm your wife. I'm your wife!

1298
01:33:41,742 --> 01:33:44,120
You know something? You hurt me.

1299
01:33:44,370 --> 01:33:48,082
You hurt me, you know that?
Can you imagine, marrying another man?

1300
01:33:49,083 --> 01:33:51,168
<i>Did I ever do anything
to make you do that?</i>

1301
01:33:51,419 --> 01:33:54,255
<i>Did I ever turn you down or anything?</i>

1302
01:33:54,505 --> 01:33:56,299
I know I let myself get fat.

1303
01:33:56,549 --> 01:33:59,760
- Don't call yourself fat.
<i>- You can't stand me to say it.</i>

1304
01:34:00,011 --> 01:34:04,056
Like I can't stand you being
a bank robber. That's what love is.

1305
01:34:04,223 --> 01:34:06,600
Yeah? You know what love is, right?

1306
01:34:06,851 --> 01:34:10,271
If you know what love is so much,
why didn't you come down here?

1307
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:14,525
- Well....
- Talk to me about love, go ahead.

1308
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:16,986
Sonny, I'm scared.

1309
01:34:17,236 --> 01:34:20,072
I'm scared. Are they
gonna shoot me or something?

1310
01:34:20,323 --> 01:34:21,741
They're not gonna shoot you!

1311
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:25,911
<i>You should see it on the TV.
They got cannons, machine guns.</i>

1312
01:34:26,162 --> 01:34:28,205
They're after me, Angie, not you.

1313
01:34:28,414 --> 01:34:30,416
It's late already
by the time I find out...

1314
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:34,420
<i>...it's just you and Sal.
I can't get a babysitter! What'll I do?</i>

1315
01:35:05,659 --> 01:35:10,498
Listen, I think I better take him back
for a cardiac check.

1316
01:35:20,925 --> 01:35:23,594
So, what's the matter?
What, he gonna die or what?

1317
01:35:23,761 --> 01:35:28,974
No, no. It's just a precautionary
measure. It's awfully warm in here.

1318
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:44,698
All right, then.
Let's go, let him out.

1319
01:35:44,949 --> 01:35:46,992
I'm not going. I'm okay.

1320
01:35:47,868 --> 01:35:49,662
I just needed the injection.

1321
01:35:49,912 --> 01:35:54,166
What, you trying to be a hero?
You don't look good. We'll let you out.

1322
01:35:54,417 --> 01:35:56,502
I'm not trying to be anything.

1323
01:35:57,086 --> 01:35:59,046
I just wanna be left alone.

1324
01:35:59,213 --> 01:36:00,798
Okay?

1325
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,468
- No one's bothering you.
- I wish to fuck you never came.

1326
01:36:05,845 --> 01:36:07,179
That's all.

1327
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:10,724
Don't try to act like
you're some angel of human kindness.

1328
01:36:16,188 --> 01:36:18,482
<i>Out of the closets and into the streets!</i>

1329
01:36:18,649 --> 01:36:20,985
<i>Out of the closets and into the streets!</i>

1330
01:36:24,405 --> 01:36:28,951
<i>Out of the closets and into the streets!
Out of the closets and into the streets!</i>

1331
01:36:38,586 --> 01:36:42,089
<i>Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!</i>

1332
01:36:42,256 --> 01:36:45,468
<i>Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!</i>

1333
01:36:45,634 --> 01:36:49,513
<i>Sonny all the way!
Sonny all the way!</i>

1334
01:37:18,918 --> 01:37:20,503
Ladies.

1335
01:37:21,837 --> 01:37:23,339
Ladies.

1336
01:37:24,757 --> 01:37:28,219
I wanna apologize
for my use of language back there.

1337
01:37:28,594 --> 01:37:31,430
Why? What did you say,
Mr. Mulvaney?

1338
01:37:37,728 --> 01:37:40,231
- What did he say?
- He said the F-word.

1339
01:37:40,481 --> 01:37:42,066
- What?
- What did he say?

1340
01:37:42,316 --> 01:37:43,817
He said the F-word.

1341
01:37:50,950 --> 01:37:52,493
- Fuck.
- I know, Miriam.

1342
01:37:52,660 --> 01:37:53,994
Fuck.

1343
01:37:56,622 --> 01:38:00,459
But I'm a Christian
and my ears are not garbage cans.

1344
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:04,380
Come on.

1345
01:38:04,547 --> 01:38:06,924
Oh, Edna.

1346
01:38:08,050 --> 01:38:10,886
- Then we shouldn't go after them.
- Then we won't.

1347
01:38:11,554 --> 01:38:13,556
- What's that?
- Sonny.

1348
01:38:13,931 --> 01:38:17,226
Could you come out, please?
Sonny?

1349
01:38:17,393 --> 01:38:19,270
- Shit.
- What?

1350
01:38:19,436 --> 01:38:22,273
- It's my mother.
- Sonny.

1351
01:38:22,815 --> 01:38:24,775
Someone here to see you. Sonny...

1352
01:38:24,942 --> 01:38:28,862
- ...could you come out, please?
- Oh, who needs this shit?

1353
01:38:29,029 --> 01:38:33,033
Sonny. Sonny,
could you come out, please?

1354
01:38:36,996 --> 01:38:38,080
Sonny.

1355
01:38:40,124 --> 01:38:42,459
Mom, what are you doing down here?

1356
01:38:43,627 --> 01:38:46,714
- I don't need you down here.
- Oh, Sonny.

1357
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:50,175
All of Brooklyn is out here.
Three networks of television.

1358
01:38:50,426 --> 01:38:53,721
- I got it all worked out, Ma.
- I talked to the man from the FBI.

1359
01:38:54,096 --> 01:38:55,931
Who? No, don't talk to anybody.

1360
01:38:56,098 --> 01:38:59,518
He says if you come out now,
everything is gonna be all right.

1361
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:02,813
- I'm trying to get you out of this.
- Don't talk to the FBI.

1362
01:39:03,063 --> 01:39:04,315
I told them everything...

1363
01:39:04,565 --> 01:39:09,445
...how you were in the war in Vietnam,
I told them you always had good jobs.

1364
01:39:09,612 --> 01:39:12,823
I told them you were with Goldwater
in '64 in the convention and...

1365
01:39:13,073 --> 01:39:15,993
Listen, I'm getting a plane
and I'm going to Algeria.

1366
01:39:16,243 --> 01:39:18,287
- I'll write you from there.
- Algeria?

1367
01:39:18,454 --> 01:39:20,706
- I gotta get out of here.
- I don't understand.

1368
01:39:20,956 --> 01:39:24,001
If I stay and talk to you,
they won't send the limousine.

1369
01:39:24,251 --> 01:39:28,464
- They'll think I'll come out with you.
- What's the matter with that?

1370
01:39:28,714 --> 01:39:30,549
Because I'm not coming with you.

1371
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:35,387
The FBI understands everything,
that it is not you that is doing this.

1372
01:39:35,638 --> 01:39:38,599
It's the pressures from your home life!

1373
01:39:38,849 --> 01:39:42,394
- Don't get on Angie now.
- Did I say one word against her?

1374
01:39:42,645 --> 01:39:45,606
You were going to. She has
nothing to do with it, it's me!

1375
01:39:45,856 --> 01:39:48,942
Your life was sweetness and roses.
And you...

1376
01:39:49,109 --> 01:39:53,656
You wouldn't need Leon if Angie
was treating you right, you know that!

1377
01:39:53,906 --> 01:39:57,493
I don't understand why you
wanna sleep with her anyway.

1378
01:39:57,743 --> 01:40:00,037
You got two kids on welfare now.

1379
01:40:00,287 --> 01:40:05,000
- You want three kids on welfare?
- I can't talk to you about this now.

1380
01:40:05,459 --> 01:40:07,795
What are you gonna do?
All right, come out.

1381
01:40:08,045 --> 01:40:11,090
I can't come out. I can't.
Sal is in there with the people.

1382
01:40:11,340 --> 01:40:14,093
- If I come out, he's gonna kill them.
- Oh, my God.

1383
01:40:14,259 --> 01:40:15,928
Run. Run.

1384
01:40:16,178 --> 01:40:19,390
Run? Where am I gonna run?
Ma, I can't run.

1385
01:40:19,640 --> 01:40:22,142
- Maybe...
- There's no maybe. No maybes.

1386
01:40:22,393 --> 01:40:25,312
You gotta go home. Where's Pop?
He didn't come, did he?

1387
01:40:25,562 --> 01:40:29,566
Is he pissed off at you!
He says he doesn't have a son.

1388
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:31,819
- He says you're dead.
- He's right.

1389
01:40:31,985 --> 01:40:33,237
- No. No.
- Look, Ma...

1390
01:40:33,404 --> 01:40:36,281
...I'm a fuck-up and an outcast
and that's it.

1391
01:40:36,532 --> 01:40:39,910
You come near me, you're gonna
get fucked over and fucked out!

1392
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,080
Now, I gotta go, Ma.
Get her home, okay?

1393
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:44,790
Just take her home.

1394
01:40:45,040 --> 01:40:47,710
How beautiful you were
when you were a baby.

1395
01:40:47,876 --> 01:40:50,671
Go home now. Get her home now.

1396
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:53,882
All right.

1397
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:02,850
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

1398
01:41:12,151 --> 01:41:13,652
Uh....

1399
01:41:18,657 --> 01:41:20,868
Being of sound mind...

1400
01:41:21,493 --> 01:41:22,828
...and body....

1401
01:41:23,954 --> 01:41:25,622
You know, what they....

1402
01:41:35,758 --> 01:41:38,093
To my darling wife...

1403
01:41:39,428 --> 01:41:40,804
...Leon...

1404
01:41:44,475 --> 01:41:46,435
...whom I love...

1405
01:41:50,314 --> 01:41:52,357
...more than any man...

1406
01:41:52,733 --> 01:41:54,693
...has loved another man...

1407
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:57,738
...in all eternity.

1408
01:42:02,451 --> 01:42:03,827
I leave...

1409
01:42:05,662 --> 01:42:09,208
...$2700...

1410
01:42:11,168 --> 01:42:14,880
...from my $10,000
life-insurance policy...

1411
01:42:18,467 --> 01:42:20,385
...to be used...

1412
01:42:21,929 --> 01:42:24,598
...for your sex-change operation.

1413
01:42:30,604 --> 01:42:33,732
If there is any money left over...

1414
01:42:36,735 --> 01:42:39,029
...I want it to go to you...

1415
01:42:41,782 --> 01:42:43,617
...at my first...

1416
01:42:44,827 --> 01:42:48,205
At the first anniversary
of my death...

1417
01:42:48,705 --> 01:42:50,624
...at my grave.

1418
01:42:59,675 --> 01:43:01,593
To my wife...

1419
01:43:02,010 --> 01:43:03,929
...to my sweet wife...

1420
01:43:05,097 --> 01:43:06,723
...Angela...

1421
01:43:09,852 --> 01:43:13,981
...5000 from the same policy.

1422
01:43:18,902 --> 01:43:21,196
You are the only woman...

1423
01:43:21,363 --> 01:43:23,615
...that I ever loved.

1424
01:43:28,871 --> 01:43:32,040
And I repledge my love to you...

1425
01:43:34,126 --> 01:43:36,169
...in this sad moment.

1426
01:43:41,592 --> 01:43:43,135
Oh....

1427
01:43:43,844 --> 01:43:46,889
To little Kimmy...

1428
01:43:47,931 --> 01:43:49,641
...and Timmy.

1429
01:43:51,268 --> 01:43:53,645
I hope you remember me, Timmy.

1430
01:43:57,065 --> 01:43:59,401
You are the little man
of the family now...

1431
01:44:08,243 --> 01:44:11,538
...and I hope
you look after them for me.

1432
01:44:15,751 --> 01:44:17,544
To my mother...

1433
01:44:21,173 --> 01:44:23,467
...I ask forgiveness.

1434
01:44:28,138 --> 01:44:30,974
You... You don't understand...

1435
01:44:33,352 --> 01:44:35,604
...the things I said...

1436
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:38,190
...and did.

1437
01:44:41,276 --> 01:44:44,738
But I'm me and I'm different.

1438
01:44:50,619 --> 01:44:53,330
I want a military funeral...

1439
01:44:57,918 --> 01:45:01,505
...and I'm entitled to have one,
free of charge.

1440
01:45:07,302 --> 01:45:10,389
God... God bless you...

1441
01:45:11,807 --> 01:45:13,767
...and watch over you...

1442
01:45:17,479 --> 01:45:20,357
...till we are joined in the hereafter.

1443
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:38,166
Here, I'll sign.
I'll spell that last name.

1444
01:45:43,797 --> 01:45:46,675
- Watch out!
- Watch out over here.

1445
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
Look out over here. Watch it.

1446
01:45:52,723 --> 01:45:54,641
Come on, sarge, just one picture?

1447
01:46:02,357 --> 01:46:04,359
Back, back!

1448
01:46:06,862 --> 01:46:09,072
All you guys, back up!

1449
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:36,266
- You're the driver?
- Yeah.

1450
01:46:38,685 --> 01:46:40,771
All right. I wanna check it out.

1451
01:46:44,858 --> 01:46:47,235
- These seats come out?
- No, they're bolted.

1452
01:46:55,160 --> 01:46:57,871
All right, here.
Light me on that side.

1453
01:46:59,372 --> 01:47:01,166
Give me light over there.

1454
01:47:06,505 --> 01:47:08,006
All right.

1455
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:16,473
Jesus, you're the man, huh?

1456
01:47:17,349 --> 01:47:20,018
I was watching. I saw you, man.

1457
01:47:21,228 --> 01:47:24,231
You should see yourself,
you wouldn't believe it.

1458
01:47:24,606 --> 01:47:27,818
- I believe it.
- Goddamn, Sheila won't believe it.

1459
01:47:27,984 --> 01:47:29,569
- Who's Sheila?
- My old lady.

1460
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,947
They said, "Gas up a stretch...

1461
01:47:32,114 --> 01:47:35,575
- ...go to 285 Prospect Park West."
- Give me some light over here.

1462
01:47:35,742 --> 01:47:39,287
I said, "Shit, another load
for the massage parlors."

1463
01:47:56,054 --> 01:47:57,097
It's okay.

1464
01:47:57,556 --> 01:47:59,516
My man, I'm gonna remember you.

1465
01:48:06,857 --> 01:48:09,401
This is Agent Murphy.
He'll be your driver.

1466
01:48:09,734 --> 01:48:11,027
No, I want him.

1467
01:48:13,363 --> 01:48:16,366
- Give me the black guy.
- Hey, man, I ain't into that shit.

1468
01:48:16,533 --> 01:48:17,826
Nobody'll hurt you.

1469
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:21,872
If they would've shot,
they would've shot already.

1470
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:24,666
- I can't allow that, Sonny.
- You can't allow?

1471
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:28,378
What makes you think you can
say shit to me? I'm running this.

1472
01:48:29,713 --> 01:48:32,340
I'll pay you. What do you want?
A hundred? Two hundred?

1473
01:48:32,507 --> 01:48:34,176
A thousand? Come on.

1474
01:48:35,427 --> 01:48:37,387
Don't look at him, I'm running this.

1475
01:48:38,722 --> 01:48:40,182
Come on.

1476
01:48:42,267 --> 01:48:43,685
Look, it'll be an adventure.

1477
01:48:49,107 --> 01:48:52,235
You men that shoot, aim for white meat.

1478
01:49:00,660 --> 01:49:02,370
Take a walk.

1479
01:49:03,747 --> 01:49:04,789
Give me him.

1480
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:10,045
You think you're dealing
with a fucking idiot?

1481
01:49:11,046 --> 01:49:12,422
Take a walk, cop!

1482
01:49:17,552 --> 01:49:20,764
Everybody is a con man. Come on.

1483
01:49:25,018 --> 01:49:26,770
I want everyone across the street.

1484
01:49:28,438 --> 01:49:30,815
I want them all back, on the sidewalk!

1485
01:49:31,066 --> 01:49:32,484
Let's go!

1486
01:49:33,193 --> 01:49:35,779
At least I know
who I'm dealing with now.

1487
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:41,201
Here's a pen for you. Come on.

1488
01:49:51,378 --> 01:49:53,255
Don't move, okay?

1489
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:59,844
Sonny, here's your document.

1490
01:50:00,971 --> 01:50:04,432
- Right.
- Oh, you gotta sign it. Here.

1491
01:50:06,226 --> 01:50:09,312
We're taking off. We're going now.

1492
01:50:09,896 --> 01:50:11,815
Okay, Sal. Where is he? Sal?

1493
01:50:12,607 --> 01:50:13,942
Sal.

1494
01:50:14,109 --> 01:50:15,819
That's it, we're going.

1495
01:50:16,653 --> 01:50:18,738
Here, people, let's go. We're going.

1496
01:50:19,406 --> 01:50:20,448
Can I get my sweater?

1497
01:50:20,615 --> 01:50:23,118
Get what you had when you came in.

1498
01:50:32,961 --> 01:50:34,421
Sal?

1499
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:38,174
Sal.

1500
01:50:41,011 --> 01:50:43,138
- How you doing?
- Good.

1501
01:50:43,305 --> 01:50:46,182
- Good? We're gonna do it, right?
- Yeah.

1502
01:50:46,683 --> 01:50:48,560
We're gonna do it. Sal, see...

1503
01:50:48,810 --> 01:50:51,396
...you gotta keep your eye on him.
He's the driver.

1504
01:50:51,646 --> 01:50:53,940
- I need it.
- No, it's mine.

1505
01:50:54,190 --> 01:50:56,401
You gotta keep
your eye on him, Sal, see?

1506
01:51:01,406 --> 01:51:03,283
All right, where am I now?

1507
01:52:01,216 --> 01:52:03,176
All right, hold it. Hold it.

1508
01:52:04,052 --> 01:52:05,804
All right, let's go.

1509
01:52:06,554 --> 01:52:09,307
Swing around now. Swing around.

1510
01:52:09,974 --> 01:52:11,935
Just keep holding hands.

1511
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:19,567
Hold it.

1512
01:52:21,486 --> 01:52:23,780
Break it on "three."
Not yet, don't break yet.

1513
01:52:24,489 --> 01:52:26,074
One...

1514
01:52:26,366 --> 01:52:27,951
...two...

1515
01:52:28,118 --> 01:52:29,702
- ...three. Go.
- Go.

1516
01:52:40,672 --> 01:52:42,882
Oh, fuck. We did it.

1517
01:52:43,049 --> 01:52:45,802
- We did it.
- Wish us luck.

1518
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:48,430
Bye-bye.

1519
01:52:50,765 --> 01:52:53,601
- Okay, you got your one.
- Follow my car.

1520
01:53:06,698 --> 01:53:08,158
Sheldon here, get me Kennedy.

1521
01:53:08,324 --> 01:53:12,579
- Sal, we did it. Huh?
- Yeah.

1522
01:53:12,996 --> 01:53:15,331
I'll be a son of a bitch, we did it.

1523
01:53:15,957 --> 01:53:18,168
Okay, let's move.
Come on, honk the horn.

1524
01:53:21,546 --> 01:53:23,840
Hey, Sal, do me a favor, will you?

1525
01:53:24,090 --> 01:53:27,051
Keep the gun pointed up.
We hit a bump, the gun'll go off.

1526
01:53:37,353 --> 01:53:39,314
All right. You set out there?

1527
01:53:42,150 --> 01:53:43,943
We're leaving now.

1528
01:53:44,194 --> 01:53:46,070
We want no trouble en route.

1529
01:53:49,073 --> 01:53:50,366
- Intersection check?
<i>- Check.</i>

1530
01:53:53,077 --> 01:53:56,080
- All right. We'll be starting up right now.
<i>- 10-4.</i>

1531
01:54:28,571 --> 01:54:29,906
It's gonna be all right.

1532
01:54:55,765 --> 01:54:57,267
Sal.

1533
01:54:57,433 --> 01:55:00,603
Sal, you just gotta remember
to keep the gun pointed up.

1534
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:25,628
You fucking scumbags...

1535
01:55:29,924 --> 01:55:31,926
Hey, let him go!

1536
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:28,710
What's he doing?

1537
01:57:29,085 --> 01:57:31,462
He's still got some
arrangements to make.

1538
01:57:44,976 --> 01:57:47,353
- That's it?
- That's it.

1539
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,314
Sal, see it? There it is.

1540
01:58:47,163 --> 01:58:48,790
Oh, I forgot.

1541
01:58:49,040 --> 01:58:51,167
I forgot to ask if they
got food on board.

1542
01:58:56,005 --> 01:58:57,507
They gonna have food on board?

1543
01:59:04,055 --> 01:59:07,266
There's your jet. We get one more now.
That's the deal.

1544
01:59:07,517 --> 01:59:09,769
Right. Okay, who goes?

1545
01:59:10,311 --> 01:59:11,771
Sylvia?

1546
01:59:13,314 --> 01:59:14,524
Maria.

1547
01:59:22,907 --> 01:59:25,117
I'll pray for you.

1548
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,286
Sal...

1549
01:59:27,745 --> 01:59:29,914
...because this is
your first plane trip...

1550
01:59:30,081 --> 01:59:32,583
...don't be scared, okay?

1551
01:59:46,180 --> 01:59:49,308
I didn't eat all day.
Will there be any food on board?

1552
01:59:49,642 --> 01:59:51,227
There'll be hamburgers. Ready?

1553
01:59:54,814 --> 01:59:56,649
- Sal.
- What?

1554
01:59:57,066 --> 01:59:58,734
Ready to go?

1555
01:59:59,318 --> 02:00:00,653
Yeah.

1556
02:00:04,907 --> 02:00:07,952
Okay. Let's move it.

1557
02:00:09,662 --> 02:00:11,080
Sal...

1558
02:00:11,998 --> 02:00:15,042
...we don't want any accidents
at this point, right?

1559
02:00:15,418 --> 02:00:17,086
You keep your gun pointed up.

1560
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:21,090
You ready to get out first?

1561
02:00:21,549 --> 02:00:22,925
I'm ready.

1562
02:00:28,055 --> 02:00:29,557
Don't shoot me.

1563
02:00:31,058 --> 02:00:33,686
Wait, hold it. Hold it. Hold it.
Hold it, please.

1564
02:00:33,853 --> 02:00:35,354
Okay, it's safe. Come on.

1565
02:00:35,521 --> 02:00:37,356
Put him away, put him away.

1566
02:00:51,704 --> 02:00:55,082
All right, guys, move back.
Come on, back up.

1567
02:01:07,845 --> 02:01:09,305
Now spread them!

1568
02:01:14,185 --> 02:01:16,938
No. No, we're all secure here.

1569
02:01:17,104 --> 02:01:19,857
Murphy will report from the car.

1570
02:01:24,487 --> 02:01:26,155
You make the report.

1571
02:01:26,405 --> 02:01:27,823
Put the gun down.

1572
02:01:28,074 --> 02:01:29,408
Back off.

1573
02:01:30,242 --> 02:01:34,205
Get up now, Sonny.
You're under arrest.

1574
02:01:34,372 --> 02:01:36,582
You have the right to remain silent.

1575
02:01:36,749 --> 02:01:39,210
You have the right to an attorney
during your interrogation.

1576
02:01:40,711 --> 02:01:44,924
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1577
02:01:45,091 --> 02:01:47,218
If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer...

1578
02:01:47,385 --> 02:01:51,514
...one will be appointed
to represent you if you wish one.

1579
02:02:04,235 --> 02:02:07,822
<i>Agent Sheldon,
would you please remain on the apron...</i>

1580
02:02:07,989 --> 02:02:11,575
<i>...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?</i>

1581
02:02:11,826 --> 02:02:12,868
<i>Repeat:</i>

1582
02:02:13,077 --> 02:02:16,372
<i>Agent Sheldon, would you please
remain on the apron...</i>

1583
02:02:16,789 --> 02:02:21,043
<i>...until the hostages are
well inside the terminal?</i>

1584
02:02:21,293 --> 02:02:23,629
Yeah, I got you. We'll hold here.
