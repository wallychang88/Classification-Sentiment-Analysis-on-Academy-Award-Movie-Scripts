00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,469
So it's been a week.

339
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,888
Yeah, Grandpa, remember?
It's been a week.

340
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,308
Last week, we went for a ride
in the car. Remember?

341
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:54,270
Oh. That's a good
machine.

342
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:58,400
Always give signals
when you turn.

343
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,235
Right.
Right.

344
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,987
Left.

345
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:10,537
WOMAN:
Let's reach for the sky.

346
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
So...

347
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:20,171
Are you a good lawyer?
Heh, heh, heh.

348
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,048
Are you honest?

349
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,010
Well, I don't know.

350
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:29,806
Being honest doesn't have much
to do with being a lawyer, Grandpa.

351
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:33,268
If you're not honest,
you got nothing.

352
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:35,603
Yeah.

353
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,690
Your parents
should see you now.

354
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:41,860
The hell with them.

355
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:45,447
They've never cared before,
why are they gonna care now?

356
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,535
They're still your parents.
No.

357
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:53,455
You raised me.

358
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,291
You're the one that put
me through law school.

359
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:58,460
You're a wonderful man, Grandpa.

360
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,795
But your son, he's a shit.

361
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,967
He was born with colic.

362
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:11,097
Sam, I love you.

363
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,645
Look at you.

364
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,315
Filled out like a man.

365
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:25,570
Soon, you'll look like a lawyer,
and you'll be a lawyer.

366
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,324
I am a lawyer, Sam.

367
00:23:29,492 --> 00:23:31,993
I've been a lawyer for 12 years.

368
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,497
[CHUCKLES]

369
00:23:44,507 --> 00:23:47,258
So it's another week already?

370
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:55,558
MAN: Do you know Jules Stouffer?
ARTHUR: Yes, I do.

371
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:58,269
MAN: Client of yours, right?
ARTHUR: Yes.

372
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,981
MAN:
Wasn't he originally
represented by Alvin Burton?

373
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,691
ARTHUR:
Yes, that is correct.

374
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,527
MAN:
Why did he change representation?

375
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:08,196
Because I handled him on
an aggravated assault charge.

376
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,698
That's my area,
not Burton's area, so...

377
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,494
Did Jules Stouffer express
dissatisfaction with Mr. Burton?

378
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,162
No. Not at all.

379
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,664
Burton's an excellent lawyer.

380
00:24:17,832 --> 00:24:19,541
You're not going after him, are you?

381
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,460
We're not going after anyone,
Mr. Kirkland. We are simply...

382
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,670
Do you
know David...?

383
00:24:23,838 --> 00:24:25,922
We are trying to review
certain accusations

384
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,174
to determine whether or not
they are true.

385
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:30,718
And to, more or less,
clean our own house.

386
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,180
So please do not overdramatize
these proceedings.

387
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:38,476
This is not the McCarthy hearings.
Oh. That's a relief.

388
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:39,894
So you're not gonna ask me:

389
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:43,523
"Are you now,
or have you ever been, a lawyer?"

390
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,819
That wasn't amusing, Mr. Kirkland.

391
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,404
Do you know David Crebbs?

392
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:52,323
No, it wasn't, Miss, um...

393
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,827
Packer.
Packer.

394
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,246
This isn't amusing.
It is, however, ridiculous.

395
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,415
Yes. David Crebbs? I know him.

396
00:25:00,583 --> 00:25:03,334
Have you ever seen...?
Is this mike working?

397
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,422
Do you know David Crebbs?

398
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,340
Why are we using microphones?

399
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,135
Why don't we just talk to each other?
We're close enough.

400
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,554
This is a hearing, Mr. Kirkland.

401
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,765
Ah. Yes. It's a hearing.

402
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,267
CRENNA:
Do you know Jules Stouffer?

403
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,686
We've already asked that
question, Mr. Crenna.

404
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,190
Oh, we're through with Stouffer?
How about Alvin Burton?

405
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,817
Do you know David Crebbs?
I already asked that.

406
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,694
What'd he say?

407
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:30,904
He said, "Yes."

408
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,865
Have you ever seen him
intoxicated in court?

409
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,202
David Crebbs
has a speech impediment.

410
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,371
Now, if you check your records,
you'll see it's there someplace.

411
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,999
No. That's the answer
to your question.

412
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,085
No, he doesn't drink.
Doesn't drink at all.

413
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:49,297
At this point,
I would just like to say

414
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:52,800
that what this committee
is doing, in theory,

415
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,886
is highly commendable.

416
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:59,307
However, in practice, it sucks.

417
00:25:59,934 --> 00:26:02,644
And I am not going to
answer any more questions.

418
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:14,113
GAIL:
What do you think
we're trying to do in there?

419
00:26:16,033 --> 00:26:17,533
Want a drink?
No.

420
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,868
Whatever you may think,

421
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:23,414
we are not conducting
some kind of witch hunt.

422
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,124
What are you doing then?

423
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,043
You might not be aware of this,

424
00:26:27,211 --> 00:26:29,504
but there's a lot of
corruption going around

425
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:31,381
that nobody's
doing anything about.

426
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,508
You think your committee's
doing something?

427
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,093
Yes, I do.

428
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:39,597
That committee
is a very dangerous farce.

429
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,726
Whoa. Mr. Kirkland.

430
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:46,271
I spend 14 hours a day
working on that committee.

431
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,274
I don't do it for laughs.
I don't care how many hours.

432
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,942
Understand?
Spend your life.

433
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:53,111
You know what
you're accomplishing?

434
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,781
If we don't police our own activities,
Ruining the careers of guys

435
00:26:56,949 --> 00:27:00,868
who wipe their ass wrong.
Nothing's gonna happen.

436
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,459
So, what do you think?

437
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,169
About what?

438
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,463
About me.
What do you think?

439
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,049
Think I'm kind of interesting?

440
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,552
Somebody you'd like
to have a drink with?

441
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,638
I think that you're crazy.

442
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:23,641
Oh. What about Daniels?

443
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,394
Say around 7:30?

444
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:31,024
I don't think so.

445
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:32,984
Eight?

446
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:36,988
Eight-thirty.

447
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:49,751
All right.

448
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,056
Uh, I'm Arthur Kirkland.
You wanted to see me?

449
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,266
Yeah.

450
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,442
Yeah, my man, Bambi,

451
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,444
ooh, he recommended you
real highly.

452
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:20,031
He said, "Arthur Kirkland,
he the man to see."

453
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,617
Okay, Ralph. Why don't you
tell me what happened.

454
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:25,578
It says here in the report
that you were involved in a robbery.

455
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:28,498
Uh-uh. No, sir.
Uh-uh. No.

456
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,458
See... See, what happened is,

457
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,794
it was time
to come down on the nigga.

458
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,797
Mr. Kirkland, you know,
it's like smoking.

459
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,007
They got to have
a nigga every 20 minutes.

460
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,468
See, what happened is,

461
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:43,763
I was in this alley petting my dog
when they came down on me.

462
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:47,225
It states here that you were...
The dog was attacking you

463
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:49,268
when you were first seen
in the alley.

464
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:51,270
Yeah? Yeah, well...

465
00:28:51,438 --> 00:28:53,564
Well, see, my dog,
he gets like that sometimes.

466
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,192
It also states that the dog

467
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,236
belonged to a Mrs. B. Jackson.

468
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,697
Well, he sure looked like my dog.

469
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:04,575
You know, he had that...
Come on, Ralph.

470
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:05,910
It also states here

471
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:09,580
that when asked what you were
doing in the alley,

472
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,960
you replied, "I don't know nothing
about that taxi-cab robbery."

473
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,837
Now, that's true, because I don't.

474
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,340
How'd you know
there was one, Ralph?

475
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:21,509
Mr. Kirkland, there's always one.

476
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,263
Ralph, tell me the truth
or get another lawyer.

477
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:28,015
I don't need the bullshit. Let's go.

478
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,810
Okay.

479
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,938
I was in that cab. But I didn't rob it.

480
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,189
It was my cousin's idea.

481
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:39,735
I didn't know nothing. It was my
cousin's idea. See, he... He crazy.

482
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,781
What's your cousin's name?
I don't know.

483
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,700
I mean...

484
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,035
He live over on Hillsdale.

485
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,204
You don't know
your cousin's name?

486
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,833
Ralph, who do you think
you're talking to?

487
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:56,669
You think I'm an idiot?
Okay, I read a report,

488
00:29:56,837 --> 00:29:59,922
I can tell if somebody's
bullshitting me or not.

489
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,966
Either you give me
straight answers

490
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,551
or you get another lawyer.

491
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:08,139
I don't have time to listen
to some jive-ass put me on.

492
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,348
Okay.

493
00:30:11,727 --> 00:30:17,440
It wasn't my idea, but I did
know what was coming down.

494
00:30:17,858 --> 00:30:21,068
See, me and
my cousin Royce...

495
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,988
Royce Shavers.

496
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:30,912
See, he figures that
since I am the way I am...

497
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,499
Mr. Kirkland,

498
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,418
I can look real fine
sometimes, you know?

499
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,922
Yeah,
I'm sure you can, Ralph.

500
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,801
Well, Royce figures
that we can be a couple.

501
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:48,179
You know, like a man
and a woman couple.

502
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:51,432
Because a cab driver will pick
up a couple a whole lot faster

503
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,310
than they will two nigga men.

504
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,437
So, uh...

505
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:03,027
we got into this cab over
on Garrison Boulevard,

506
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,489
and we asked him to take us down
to the harbor.

507
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:10,284
You know, like...
Like we was tourists.

508
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,787
And, um...

509
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,752
Hey, man, I...
I can't go to jail, man.

510
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,881
I just can't do it.
I can't go to that place.

Please, Mr. Kirkland,
you've got to help me.

Please.

00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,143
Okay.
Please.

514
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:39,647
Okay, I'll help you, Ralph.
Just don't lie to me, that's all.

515
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:42,441
Okay? Okay.
Yes, sir.

516
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:47,655
Thank you.
Don't lie to me. Okay?

517
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,657
Yes, sir.
Okay.

Oh, God.

00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,010
Well...

524
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,513
You really take renting
an unfurnished apartment
literally, don't you?

525
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:15,349
Arthur, you know it doesn't
have to stay this way.

526
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:18,894
What happened?

527
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,023
Did your wife take you
in the divorce settlement?

528
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,484
She had a better lawyer.
Oh.

What about your kids?
Get to see them much?

530
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,490
Well, they're in California,
you know.

531
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,285
Phone calls, holidays.

Put the food out,
I'll get the plates.

533
00:32:37,873 --> 00:32:41,709
I guess I was lucky.
We never had any kids.

How long were you married?
Three years.

Were you in love?
No.

Yeah.

just about every night.

How did you feel when you walked
out on the committee this morning?

Did you feel all those daggers
in your back?

dangerous group, you know?

Arthur, why?

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:34,053
Why do you feel
it's dangerous?

552
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:37,515
Because you're conning
the public into thinking
you're doing something.

553
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:40,017
And you're not.
Yeah. But we are doing something.

No.
We are protecting the public

00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:45,064

is what we're doing.

something about what's going on.

We are not sitting in jail at nights
because of contempt of court.

Yeah.

Uh-huh. You know why?
I have no idea. Tell me.

581
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,532
I got a client who's in jail
because of a faulty taillight

582
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,159
and I can't get him out.

583
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:22,578
What do you mean
you can't get him out?

You wanna hear a story
about our wonderful judicial system?

585

Hm?
Sure.

586
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:31,212
There's a guy named
Jeff McCullaugh,

587
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:34,590
and he's going down
the highway one night

588
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:39,220
and the cops stop him
because his taillight isn't working.

589
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,764
They pull him over to the side,
run a make on him.

590
00:35:41,932 --> 00:35:45,601
Computer kicks back
that there's a Jeff McCullaugh

591
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,687
wanted in Alabama
for assault with a deadly weapon.

592
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:50,731
Was this the same Jeff McCullaugh?
No.

593
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:54,026
But he fits
the general description
so they arrest him.

594
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,862
Why didn't McCullaugh tell them
they had the wrong person?

595
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,115
He told the public defender,
who I don't think really believed him.

596
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,700
And he was too busy.

597
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,787
He never even bothered to check.
Are you serious?

598
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:07,414
Ah, wait. It gets better.

599
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:13,045
While Jeff is sitting in jail,
a guard is stabbed.

600
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:16,006
And the knife is planted
in Jeff's cell.

601
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,801
And Jeff is brought to trial
on a new charge,

602
00:36:18,969 --> 00:36:22,054
this time, assaulting a guard
with a deadly weapon.

603
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:24,765
And a trial date is set

604
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:28,435
six months from the time
he was first picked up.

605
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,982
I'll make a long story short for you.
Six months go by

606
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:37,152
and a very shaky, very crazy
Jeff McCullaugh goes to court.

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,573
Now, the public defender
who's defending him, he says...

608
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,243
He tells Jeff that he can get him off
Mm-hm.

609
00:36:44,411 --> 00:36:45,452
If he pleads guilty.

610
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,205
He'll make a deal with the judge,
and he'll get him off.

611
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:49,456
Time served.
Right.

612
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,750
So he pleads guilty
even though he's innocent.

613
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:55,462
That's right. However,
the deal was made
with a Judge Callahan.

614
00:36:55,630 --> 00:37:00,718
The day of the trial,
Judge Callahan cannot be found.

615
00:37:01,011 --> 00:37:02,970
Fleming is in his place.

616
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:06,098
Fleming doesn't know
anything about the deal.

617
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,518
Jeff pleads guilty.

618
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:13,772
Fleming sentences Jeff
to five years in prison.

So one little guy

621
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:23,824
has already spent
a year and a half in jail

622
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,784
because his lights didn't work.

623
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,328
I've spent the last year

624
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,873
putting together enough evidence
to prove he's innocent.

625
00:37:31,041 --> 00:37:32,124
And I prove it.

626
00:37:32,292 --> 00:37:35,294
I get it all together,
and I bring it into Fleming's court

627
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:37,504
and he throws it out.

628
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:41,425
Why?
Because it came in three days late.

629
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:47,389
Holy shit.

630
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,018

No, Arthur. That's the law.

You can't fault Fleming legally

because he was going
by the letter of the law.

Are you kidding?
No, I'm not.

You don't know he's guilty.

You're making
an assumption he's guilty

You're all he's got, believe me.

So he's counting on tapping
that emotion in you which says:

"Let's get somebody in power.
Let's get a judge."

These proceedings are here
to see that justice is done.

And justice is, as any
reasonable person would tell you,

One truth, a tragic one,

is that that girl

Another truth

1796

is that the prosecution

of substantiating evidence,

1798

other than the testimony
of the victim herself.

1799
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:57,840
Another truth
is that my client voluntarily...

01:53:16,290 --> 01:53:18,291
Was it blackmail?

1859
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:21,002
No.

1860
01:53:22,421 --> 01:53:24,380
Was it jealousy?

1861
01:53:24,673 --> 01:53:26,215
No.

1862
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,553
Yesterday,

1863
01:53:30,721 --> 01:53:33,806
I found out why.

1864
01:53:38,729 --> 01:53:42,064
She doesn't have a motive.

1865
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:45,902
You know why?

1866
01:53:48,489 --> 01:53:50,990
Because she's not lying.

1867
01:53:52,576 --> 01:53:55,244
And ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

1868
01:53:56,622 --> 01:53:58,998
the prosecution

1869
01:53:59,541 --> 01:54:03,211
is not gonna get
that man today.

1870
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:04,962
No.

1871
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:08,174
Because I'm gonna get him.

1872
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:10,635
My client,

1873
01:54:10,802 --> 01:54:15,056
the honorable Henry T. Fleming,

1874
01:54:15,224 --> 01:54:18,976
should go right to fucking jail!

1875
01:54:19,144 --> 01:54:22,271
The son of a bitch is guilty!

1876
01:54:22,439 --> 01:54:24,065
FRANK: Your Honor.
ARTHUR: That man is guilty.

1877
01:54:24,233 --> 01:54:25,775
Mr. Kirkland.
Damn it, Arthur!

1878
01:54:25,943 --> 01:54:29,570
That man there.
That man is a slime.

1879
01:54:30,113 --> 01:54:31,906
He is a slime.

1880
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:34,367
If he's allowed to go free,

1881
01:54:34,535 --> 01:54:37,495
then something really wrong
is going on here.

1882
01:54:37,663 --> 01:54:39,288
RAYFORD:
Mr. Kirkland, you are out of order.

1883
01:54:39,456 --> 01:54:41,707
You're out of order.
You're out of order!

1884
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:44,293
The whole trial is out of order.

1885
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:47,129
They're out of order. That man...

1886
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:51,092
That sick, crazy, depraved man

1887
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:53,803
raped and beat that woman there!

1888
01:54:53,971 --> 01:54:57,306
And he'd like to do it again!
He told me so.

1889
01:54:57,474 --> 01:55:00,810
MAN 1: Please.
ARTHUR: It's just a show. It's a show.

1890
01:55:00,978 --> 01:55:03,145
MAN 2: Come on.
ARTHUR: It's Let's Make a Deal.

1891
01:55:03,313 --> 01:55:07,900
Let's Make a Deal.
Hey, Frank, you wanna make a deal?

1892
01:55:08,068 --> 01:55:11,821
I got an insane judge who likes
to beat the shit out of women.

1893
01:55:11,989 --> 01:55:13,489
What do you wanna give me, Frank?

1894
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:15,658
Three weeks' probation?
Damn it, Arthur.

1895
01:55:16,577 --> 01:55:19,328
You... You son of a bitch!

1896
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:22,290
You're supposed
to stand for something.

1897
01:55:22,457 --> 01:55:24,667
You're supposed to protect people.

1898
01:55:24,835 --> 01:55:27,295
But instead,
you fuck and murder them.

1899
01:55:27,462 --> 01:55:28,629
RAYFORD:
Get him out of here.

1900
01:55:28,797 --> 01:55:32,091
You killed McCullaugh.
You killed him!

1901
01:55:32,259 --> 01:55:35,094
Hold it. Hold it.

1902
01:55:35,262 --> 01:55:38,931
I just completed
my opening statement.

1903
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:40,141
[WHISTLES]

1904
01:55:40,309 --> 01:55:41,892
All right!

1905
01:55:42,728 --> 01:55:45,104
[CROWD MURMURING]

1906
01:55:50,360 --> 01:55:52,361
RAYFORD: Order in the court.
BAILIFF: Back behind the line.

1907
01:55:52,529 --> 01:55:56,157
RAYFORD: Order in the courtroom.
BAILIFF: Do what I say.

1908
01:55:57,326 --> 01:55:59,493
Oh, shit.

1909
01:56:04,958 --> 01:56:07,293
MAN:
The judge. The judge says
now you wanted a trial,

1910
01:56:07,461 --> 01:56:09,712
so now the guy's doing
two to 10.

1911
01:56:20,974 --> 01:56:22,558
Hi, Arthur.

1912
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:26,687
Good to see you.
Nice day.
