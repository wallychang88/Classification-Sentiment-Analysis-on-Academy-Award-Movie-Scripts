(GAVEL BANGING)

2
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,152
AUCTIONEER: Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in luck today here in Los Angeles.

3
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:44,654
Through the years,
the Bullwinkle Galleries...

4
00:01:44,754 --> 00:01:46,448
have brought up for auction...

5
00:01:46,548 --> 00:01:51,370
many collections of the personal effects
of your famous movie stars.

6
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,248
But today, today is indeed
a red-letter day.

7
00:01:55,348 --> 00:01:58,383
The personal effects of Tony Hunter!

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,794
Lot 94.

9
00:01:59,894 --> 00:02:03,972
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's start out with Lot 94.

10
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,061
Some of the potpourri
of Mr. Hunter's own personal costumes...

11
00:02:09,237 --> 00:02:12,933
that he used in his famous
dancing-singing pictures.

12
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:16,186
Remember this?
Perhaps the most famous top hat...

13
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,188
and stick of our generation.

14
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:22,192
Yes, the one he used
in Swinging Down to Panama...

15
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,576
and all his other famous pictures.

16
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:28,580
Let's start with $5. Do I hear $5?

17
00:02:28,923 --> 00:02:31,041
It's worth a lot more.

18
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:33,794
All right. Let's start with 2.

19
00:02:34,137 --> 00:02:37,381
Well? Fifty cents?

20
00:02:39,225 --> 00:02:40,717
Anything?

21
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,472
Just one more for the road.
About 20 minutes to New York.

22
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,064
Bottoms up.

23
00:02:57,202 --> 00:03:00,021
- So you're from California?
- That's right. Sunny Cal.

24
00:03:00,121 --> 00:03:02,691
- Sunny Cal?
- Yeah. Sunny Cal.

25
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:06,528
Say, you're from Sunny Cal. I bet
you know a lot of movie stars out there.

26
00:03:06,628 --> 00:03:08,863
I got to confess.
I'm just like you and me.

27
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,366
- Only get to see them in the movies.
- Ha, ha.

28
00:03:11,466 --> 00:03:14,251
But I read about them.
I know all about them.

29
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,380
Boy, I'd sure like to meet
that Ava Gardner.

30
00:03:18,556 --> 00:03:21,383
- You're a little late. She's married.
- Yeah.

31
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,628
- You know this one?
- MAN 1: Who's that?

32
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:27,048
- MAN 2: Tony Hunter.
- Oh, him. The singing-dancing fella.

33
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:31,261
My wife used to go see all his pictures.
Almost broke up our home.

34
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:33,603
"Tony Hunter! Tony Hunter!"

35
00:03:33,905 --> 00:03:35,849
He was good 12 or 15 years ago...

36
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,400
but the columnists out there
say he's through.

37
00:03:39,035 --> 00:03:42,689
TONY: Through? He's washed up.
Hasn't made a picture in three years.

38
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,859
- Did you say something, mister?
- I said I agreed with you.

39
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,527
That Tony Hunter's a has-been.

40
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:49,362
- Got a match?
- Yeah.

41
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,741
I wouldn't go to see him
if they gave away $5 bills with the ticket.

42
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:54,159
(MAN 2 CHUCKLES)

43
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:55,584
Yeah.

44
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,671
We should be pulling...

45
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:04,669
The funny thing about what you're saying,
boys, is that it's absolutely true.

46
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,387
Here. Have an exploding cigar.

47
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:25,440
- This the last of the bags, Mr. Hunter?
- Yeah.

48
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,443
Say, porter, um, could you see that
they get put in a taxi...

49
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,788
- ...and taken up to the, uh, Plaza Hotel?
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

50
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:35,241
Everybody's getting off, sir.

51
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:38,703
If you don't mind,
I'll just sit for a minute or two.

52
00:04:38,803 --> 00:04:41,998
You couldn't just, uh, make up my berth
for the night here, could you?

53
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:44,383
No, sir. I couldn't do that.

54
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:48,095
(HUMMING)

55
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:58,681
There's a mob of reporters
and photographers out there.

56
00:04:58,781 --> 00:05:01,976
Yep. There must be some big shot aboard.
Maybe the president.

57
00:05:02,076 --> 00:05:05,362
No, too many for that.
Probably a movie star.

00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:14,413
- TONY: Hi, fellas.
- Tony Hunter! Hello, Mr. Hunter!

60
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:17,158
Thanks for the red-carpet bit.
I didn't expect it.

61
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:20,578
- MAN 1: What brings you to New York?
- Just fooling around.

62
00:05:20,678 --> 00:05:22,914
- Between pictures, Tony?
- In a manner of speaking.

63
00:05:23,014 --> 00:05:26,000
Didn't I read something in Variety
about you going into a show?

64
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,629
Lily and Les Marton had something
planned for me. I haven't decided yet.

65
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,758
I haven't been on the stage in a long time.
And you get into a different medium.

66
00:05:33,858 --> 00:05:35,718
- What it actually is...
- MAN 2: Here she is!

67
00:05:35,818 --> 00:05:37,804
- MAN 1: Excuse me, Mr. Hunter.
- See you later.

68

MAN 2: Hi, Miss Gardner.

69
00:05:39,197 --> 00:05:41,683
MAN 3: Miss Gardner, hold it, please?
Smile pretty. Thanks.

70
00:05:41,783 --> 00:05:45,353
- MAN 2: How long you going to be in town?
- I have no definite plans.

71
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:47,939
Tony! I had no idea
you were on the train.

72
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,066
This is a surprise.
You going to be here long?

73
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,485
- Perhaps a week or two...
- Excuse me, Miss Gardner.

74
00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:55,405
Could the boys get one more shot of you
coming out the door?

75
00:05:55,505 --> 00:05:58,158
Honestly, isn't all this stuff
an awful bore?

76
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,326
- Good to see you, Tony.
- It's nice to see you.

to do a Sunday feature on you.

People just won't let them alone, will they?

80
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:15,932
No. I don't know how they stand it.

81
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,899
(SINGING) I'll go my way by myself

82
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:28,820
Like walking under the clouds

I'll go my way by myself

84

All alone in a crowd

85
00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:45,754
I'll try to apply myself

86
00:06:46,764 --> 00:06:50,258
And teach my heart how to sing

87
00:06:52,312 --> 00:06:56,431
I'll go my way by myself

88
00:06:57,275 --> 00:07:01,144
Like a bird on the wing

89
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:06,942
I'll face the unknown

90
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:12,447
I'll build a world of my own

91
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:18,119
No one knows better than I, myself

92
00:07:18,629 --> 00:07:25,835
I'm by myself alone

Sis-boom-bah, yay

Did you kids paint
those signs just for me?

98
00:07:54,749 --> 00:07:56,992
That's cute. Piggy.

99
00:07:58,002 --> 00:07:59,828
Let's get rid of this stuff.

100
00:08:00,338 --> 00:08:02,747
This is the biggest surprise I've had.

101
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:10,665
- Mister, can I have your autograph?
- You certainly can, gal, come here!

102
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,166
That's my wife. Let go.

103
00:08:12,266 --> 00:08:14,627
Don't worry.
I'll get around to you in a minute.

104
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,671
- Who's he?
- Never saw him before in my life.

105
00:08:16,771 --> 00:08:19,632
- Hello, piggy!
- Hello, yourself, you two-headed creep!

106
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,426
Why didn't you say when you were coming?

107
00:08:21,526 --> 00:08:22,802
We had to ask your agent.

108
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,847
- Why didn't you send us a wire?
- I wanted to sneak in quietly.

109
00:08:25,947 --> 00:08:30,018
Believe me, I didn't have any trouble.
I want to see if you've changed in a year.

110
00:08:30,118 --> 00:08:33,521
No, Les, you haven't changed a bit.
You look desperately ill, as usual.

111
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:35,857
- What'd you have to say that for?
- Just kidding.

112
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:37,442
I've been feeling terrible all day.

113
00:08:37,542 --> 00:08:41,821
Kind of faint, lightheaded,
a lot of pressure here, queasy inside...

114
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,448
- ...my pulse...
- You look great.

115
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:47,201
As for you, that New York pallor
is like a breath of fresh air.

116
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:51,497
You're too pretty to be a successful writer
and much too pretty to be married to that.

117
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,791
That's the prettiest compliment
I've had all day!

118
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:56,669
Come on, you two-headed lovebirds,
there's work to be done!

119
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:00,256
- Now I have here a script of a show!
- Les, you didn't bring it.

we've ever written.

Only two blocks more, then Sardi's.

- You tell him, Les.

Who do you think
is going to do the show?

128
00:09:23,588 --> 00:09:27,784
Only the greatest director-producer
in town, Jeffrey Cordova.

129
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:29,827
- Who?
- Jeff Cordova.

130
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,705
We're meeting him tonight, backstage,
right after the show.

131
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,416
- What did you say his name was?
- Jeffrey Cordova!

132
00:09:35,516 --> 00:09:36,709
You're not serious.

133
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,045
I don't think he ever heard
of this fella.

134
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:42,131
What's the matter? Don't you
get newspapers back in California?

135
00:09:42,231 --> 00:09:44,675
This genius directed Man
in a Mousetrap...

136
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:49,263
The Lost Nymph, and did them both
while starring in Oedipus Rex.

137
00:09:49,363 --> 00:09:51,974
He's got three hits running,
and he's starring in one of them.

138
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,393
Only one?

139
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:57,522
This fella's fabulous, phenomenal,
fantastic! He can do anything.

140
00:09:57,622 --> 00:09:59,399
- Has he ever directed a musical?
- Oh...

141
00:09:59,499 --> 00:10:01,567
What's the difference?
He can do anything.

142
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,695
He's theater.
He's a new kind of theater man, Tony.

143
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:07,156
The theater's changed.
Lots of things have changed.

144
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:08,957
They certainly have.

145
00:10:10,092 --> 00:10:12,585
What's happened to 42nd Street?

146
00:10:13,304 --> 00:10:17,041
I just can't get over it.
I just can't understand it.

147
00:10:17,141 --> 00:10:20,670
This used to be the great theater street
of the town. The New Amsterdam.

148
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,756
I had one of my biggest successes there.
Ran a year and a half.

149
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:26,884
Noel Coward and Gertie were here in
Private Lives in the Selwyn.

150
00:10:26,984 --> 00:10:29,053
Strictly carriage trade,
nothing but the finest.

151
00:10:29,153 --> 00:10:33,307
First show I ever did was at the Eltinge,
and I don't believe that's here anymore.

152
00:10:33,407 --> 00:10:35,601
- Oh! Oh! Oh!
- What's the matter?

153
00:10:35,701 --> 00:10:38,396
- LESTER: I think he broke my leg.
- Can you put your weight on it?

154
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:40,648
- LESTER: I'll try.
- I'm sorry! I didn't mean it.

155
00:10:40,748 --> 00:10:43,025
- Okay, forget it.
- Let's get him a cab.

156
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,444
Taxi!

00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:46,988
Here, let me carry you.

159
00:10:47,088 --> 00:10:50,658
My dear man, it's entirely my fault
and I apologize.

160
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:52,452
Here's for your trouble.

161
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:55,121
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Lean on me.

162
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,332
- I can stand anything but pain.
- You'll be all right.

I'm sick of these artificial barriers
between the musical and the drama.

286
00:21:18,719 --> 00:21:22,414
In my mind, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...

287
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:26,293

and the magic rhythms...

I tell you, if it moves you,
if it stimulates you...

292
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:39,139
if it entertains you, it's theater.

293
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:42,518
When the right combination gets together
and it spells theater...

294
00:21:42,618 --> 00:21:45,986
I got to be right in there
up to my armpits.

295
00:21:46,455 --> 00:21:47,940
That's higher than usual.

296
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,484
Now, that's what I wanted
Tony to hear you say.

297
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:55,030
I tried to tell him how you feel, but I knew
that you could say it so beautifully.

298
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,574
Lily, you splendid animal.

299
00:21:57,674 --> 00:22:00,619
Take your hands off my wife
and let's get down to business.

300
00:22:00,719 --> 00:22:03,831
Now I have here a script.
It's great. It's ready to roll.

301
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:07,501
Jeff, I want you to take this home.
I want you to read it tonight...

302
00:22:07,601 --> 00:22:10,754
But before I do,
give me a rough idea of the plot.

303
00:22:10,854 --> 00:22:13,507
- LESTER: Now?
- Throw it at me for a quick impression.

304
00:22:13,607 --> 00:22:15,592
- TONY: I'm dying to hear it.
- LILY: You tell it.

305
00:22:15,692 --> 00:22:17,928
- You do it so much better.
- Lester, honestly.

306
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:20,688
- Please, Lily, tell them.
- Lester, honestly.

307
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:25,435
With Tony in mind, we naturally
visualize a light and intimate show.

308
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:29,523
We want to give him a chance to play
a charming guy, with just enough plot...

309
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:32,700
to make him do lots
of gay and varied numbers.

310
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:36,363
He's a writer and illustrator
of children's books...

311
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:38,031
but to get in the real dough...

312
00:22:38,131 --> 00:22:41,201
on the side,
he writes lurid murder mysteries...

313
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:43,794
full of violence and buckets of blood.

314
00:22:44,346 --> 00:22:47,124
The success of these
makes him feel he's sort of...

315
00:22:47,224 --> 00:22:49,918
sold his soul to the devil,
but he keeps on doing it.

316
00:22:50,018 --> 00:22:53,338
There's lots of comedy implications
with his friends, played by us.

317
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,175
- With his girl.
- I love this. Terrific possibilities.

318
00:22:56,275 --> 00:22:58,510
And some of the best numbers
we've ever written!

319
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:02,848
Children's playground, a reform school,
12 showgirls playing softball!

320
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:06,310
- And a number about a murder mystery!
- You two are the end.

321

00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:34,588
but valid in terms of today,
of modern life.

328
00:23:34,688 --> 00:23:36,506
Jeff, I'm so glad!

329
00:23:36,606 --> 00:23:40,260
Of course, these modern thrillers,
he's got to keep turning them out.

330
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,346
They make him fame, money. He's caught.

331
00:23:42,446 --> 00:23:44,056
It's a funny situation.

332
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:47,935
Of course! It's brilliant,
contemporary, perceptive.

333
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:51,362
This story's a modern version of Faust.

334
00:23:52,748 --> 00:23:55,157
- Faust?
- You're kidding, Jeff.

335
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:59,613
I guess I didn't tell it right.
I didn't bring out the point.

336
00:23:59,713 --> 00:24:03,992
But you did bring out the point admirably.
You used the phrase:

337
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:06,627
"He sells his soul to the devil."

338
00:24:06,803 --> 00:24:10,123
Now, that's the line you have to follow
straight through.

339
00:24:10,223 --> 00:24:12,918
Just like Faust,
this man is tempted by the devil...

340
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:17,596
and his compromise, his sellout,
must end in eternal damnation.

341
00:24:18,065 --> 00:24:20,008
That'll leave them laughing.

342
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:24,137
Kids, you've got a choice here
between a nice little musical comedy...

343
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:27,057
and a modern musical morality play...

344
00:24:27,157 --> 00:24:29,692
with meaning and stature!

345
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:33,981
- But we don't want to write Faust.
- You're taking me too literally.

346
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:36,615
I want to do your story. I love it!

347
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,444
But I want to angle it
to bring out the analogy...

348
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:42,413
between the Faust legend
and this man's story.

349
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:46,535
Won't this make it heavy?
Is this a box-office idea?

350
00:24:46,635 --> 00:24:48,036
Is Faust box-office?

351
00:24:48,136 --> 00:24:51,373
Listen, Faust by Christopher Marlowe,
Faust by Goethe, Faust by Gounod...

352
00:24:51,473 --> 00:24:52,833
Faust by Hector Berlioz.

353
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,920
I tell you, anyone who's touched this
legend has turned it into a gold mine.

354
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,804
It's got to be a smash.

355
00:24:59,689 --> 00:25:02,551
It could still have all the fun in it,
couldn't it?

356
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:06,680
- Yeah, and some stature thrown in.
- Now, kids, I'm happy about this.

357
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,349
- Really happy.
- So are we, Jeff.

358
00:25:09,449 --> 00:25:10,892
This publisher you mentioned...

359
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:14,028
obviously, he could be
the counterpart of the devil.

360
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:20,868
Evil personified!

361
00:25:21,294 --> 00:25:25,623
Leading all mankind
into the paths of temptation!

362
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:29,703
- LILY: But nobody could play it like you.
- Nobody's going to.

363
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:32,046
LESTER:
You mean you're going to play it?

364
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,125
The part of the girl... Somebody fresh.

365
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:39,046
Somebody with fire, charm, grace, beauty.
Gabrielle Gerard.

366
00:25:39,146 --> 00:25:42,549
- Gerard? She's a ballet dancer.
- She doesn't want to do a show.

367
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:45,135
- She turns them all down.
- Nobody ever turns me down.

368
00:25:45,235 --> 00:25:48,055
Do you really think you could get her?
What a cast!

369
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:52,768
Tony Hunter, Jeff Cordova,
Gabrielle Gerard! Tony! Isn't this exciting?

370
00:25:52,868 --> 00:25:54,234
Yeah.

371
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:58,405
Now, look, this is going to be
a sort of modern Faust story.

372
00:25:58,874 --> 00:26:03,327
I play the Faust character. You play
the Devil. It'll have stature, importance.

373
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:06,490
- I have to dance with this ballet dancer?
- She's wonderful.

374
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,783
It'll be great.

375
00:26:07,883 --> 00:26:11,244
It'll be great for somebody.
I'll pick up my marbles and go home.

376
00:26:11,344 --> 00:26:14,247
Fellas, bless you and good luck,
but this just ain't for me.

377
00:26:14,347 --> 00:26:16,333
I know what I can do,
and I'm sticking to it.

378
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:19,544
That's the trouble. You've stuck to it,
and you're stuck with it.

379
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:22,172
- What?
- JEFF: Nobody admires you more than I.

380
00:26:22,272 --> 00:26:25,384
I've seen every show
and every movie you've ever done...

381
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,177
but let's face some brutal facts.

382
00:26:27,277 --> 00:26:30,389
Times have changed, Tony.
You haven't changed with them.

383
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:34,692
- You've gone stale.
- Then you certainly don't need me.

384
00:26:35,452 --> 00:26:36,937
Yes, we do!

385
00:26:37,037 --> 00:26:39,439
Because you can be greater
than you ever were!

The new Tony Hunter. Tony Hunter, 1953!

390
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:55,497
- But can I do it?
- It's a challenge to all of us...

391
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:58,166
but that's what the theater's about:
a challenge.

392
00:26:58,266 --> 00:27:00,585
Whatever I am,
whether it's a new me or an old me...

393
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,504
remember, I'm still just an entertainer.

It's all entertainment!

Believe me, there is no difference
between the magic rhythms...

397
00:27:11,154 --> 00:27:13,849
- ...of Bill Robinson's immortal feet...
- You said that before.

398
00:27:13,949 --> 00:27:17,644
All right, what did Bill Robinson do?
He danced on the stairs, didn't he?

399
00:27:17,744 --> 00:27:20,397
Now I happen to play Oedipus the king
on the same stairs.

400
00:27:20,497 --> 00:27:23,157
What's the difference?
We're all theater.

401

Show me the greatest tragic actor...

402
00:27:25,794 --> 00:27:27,988
or the lowest red-nosed comic
in burlesque...

403

The lights on the lady in tights

- You know you can't get Gerard.
- Why?

Because Paul Byrd won't let her
do a show. He's a tough customer.

Gabrielle is not going to do a show.
She's too important to ballet.

to churn already.

for a wonderful singer for the girl.

to stress the dancing in that role?

No, Paul.

but Gabrielle has all that and more.

Gabrielle? Paul,
I feel a little embarrassed.

498
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,893
I think she's charming,
within her limitations. Charming.

monkey wrench into things, doesn't it?

- Don't be childish.

in this show.

00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:36,799
- What makes you say that?
- Did he come backstage to see me...

after the performance?

- You're a famous leading ballerina.

He's a famous movie and stage actor.

He's practically a historical character
by now.

Dancing with him is like dancing
with a statue of General Grant.

I'm going to do the choreography,
so there's nothing for you to worry about.

in the show.

The story he's telling them has nothing
to do with the story we wrote.

00:40:45,468 --> 00:40:47,995
This will mean months of rewriting.

the brains, the talent, the artists.

653
00:43:34,345 --> 00:43:36,963
Wonderful. Aren't they wonderful?

654
00:43:41,143 --> 00:43:42,385
(ALL CHATTERING)

655
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,464
You have no idea
how well things are going.

656
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:47,473
It's really wonderful.

657
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:50,261
Ladies and gentlemen.

658
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:52,721
I want you all to meet
the happy little group...

659
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:54,390
that's responsible for the show...

660
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:57,726
that everyone will be clamoring
to get seats for next season.

661
00:43:57,826 --> 00:44:00,653
The celebrated choreographer Paul Byrd.

662
00:44:02,998 --> 00:44:07,194
The authors you know:
Lily and Lester Marton.

663
00:44:07,294 --> 00:44:09,162
Take a bow, Lily.

664
00:44:09,588 --> 00:44:11,574
And, ladies and gentlemen...

665
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:13,909
my star, Tony Hunter.

666
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:17,628
A name, a talent.
Mr. Show Business himself.

667
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,419
And, ladies and gentlemen,
his new leading lady.

668
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:27,590
That glamorous, delightful dancer
from the magical world of ballet.

669
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,893
Mr. Hunter's own personal choice,
Gabrielle Gerard.

670
00:44:34,196 --> 00:44:37,892
I think, gentlemen, you will agree
your investment is safe, yes?

671
00:44:37,992 --> 00:44:40,985
Now let's relax
and have a drink, shall we?

672
00:44:42,371 --> 00:44:46,400
My dear, how do you authors
ever think of these brilliant ideas?

673
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,695
That damnation scene.
Did you ever in your life hear...

674
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:53,956
My boy. I had the pleasure
of backing your last show too.

675
00:44:54,174 --> 00:44:57,126
Jeffrey. How about?

676
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:14,803
There it is, folks. The work light.

677
00:45:14,903 --> 00:45:17,848
Only an electric bulb, perhaps,
but for the next four weeks...

678
00:45:17,948 --> 00:45:20,809
that will be our sun,
our moon, our stars.

679
00:45:20,909 --> 00:45:24,313
These four walls will be our universe,
our private world.

680
00:45:24,413 --> 00:45:27,650
We enter with nothing but a dream,
but when we leave...

681
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:29,443
we'll have a show.

682
00:45:29,543 --> 00:45:33,906
In between, there will be enthusiasms,
frustrations, hot tempers...

683
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:35,324
ha, ha, cold coffee.

684
00:45:35,424 --> 00:45:38,035
Some of us will fight,
some fall in love...

685
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:40,621
but all of us will work and adore it...

686
00:45:40,721 --> 00:45:43,666
because all of us are inspired
by the same thing.

687
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:47,586
The night that curtain goes up,
it will go up on a smash hit.

688
00:45:47,686 --> 00:45:49,713
And believe me, kids...

689
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:52,883
there's nothing in the world
as soothing...

690
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:55,101
as a smash hit.

691

(INAUDIBLE)

692
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:50,948
What do you think this is,
summer stock or something?

(INAUDIBLE)

694
00:47:12,146 --> 00:47:13,387
Go!

695
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:19,094
That's it. That's wonderful.
Why didn't you do it before?

696
00:47:19,194 --> 00:47:20,679
Good, men.

697
00:47:20,779 --> 00:47:23,432
Honey, would you try
that cross, please, again for me?

698
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:26,810
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

699
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:29,730
"You got me wrong.
I'm a self-made snake.

Eat or be eaten.

"I just realized that I like to eat,
and to eat caviar whenever possible.

00:47:37,546 --> 00:47:39,789
"Anything wrong with that?"

703
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,701
"Anything wrong with that?" A bad line.

704
00:47:42,801 --> 00:47:47,373
What we need is some quick image,
like "spreading ideals on a cracker."

705
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:50,417
You all like that? "Ever try
spreading ideals on a cracker?"

706
00:47:50,517 --> 00:47:51,960
Let me hear it, Tony.

707
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:54,463
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?

708
00:47:54,563 --> 00:47:57,424
- Jeff. I don't...
- Honey, just try that cross again for me.

709
00:47:57,524 --> 00:48:00,851
"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

"Listen, baby. We all live
by the law of the jungle..."

712
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:08,894
- Excuse me, Tony.
- "...eat or be eaten."

713
00:48:08,994 --> 00:48:10,778
Pardon me, folks.

714
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:19,488
You know about icebergs, don't you?

715
00:48:19,588 --> 00:48:22,533
One-eighth above the surface,
seven-eighths below. That's you.

716
00:48:22,633 --> 00:48:25,619
You're giving me only that one-eighth.
I'm greedy. I want more.

717
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:27,496
All eight-eighths. Now let it rip, Tony.

718
00:48:27,596 --> 00:48:31,875
Give it too much. Go way over.
Come along. The whole eight-eighths!

719
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:33,377
Okay, Gaby. Same place.

"The same kind of opportunistic snake
that he is."

721
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:37,840
You got me wrong. I'm a self-made snake!

722
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:41,176
Listen, baby. We all live by
the law of the jungle: Eat or be eaten!

723
00:48:41,276 --> 00:48:45,055
And I realized that I like to eat,
and eat caviar whenever possible.

724
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:48,016
Did you ever try spreading ideals
on a cracker?

725
00:48:48,116 --> 00:48:51,068
Good boy, Tony.
That's it. Eight-eighths.

726
00:49:03,298 --> 00:49:05,868
- Sorry. Butterfingers.
- No. It's not your fault, Tony.

727
00:49:05,968 --> 00:49:07,995
It's an awkward pattern.
I have a better idea.

728
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,372
You hold your position right here,
and Jimmy...

729
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:13,876
suppose you pick up Gaby like that,
and put her down...

730
00:49:13,976 --> 00:49:16,128
right here next to Tony?
Now you see, Tony...

731
00:49:16,228 --> 00:49:18,547
I'd like to practice it with her
two or three times.

732
00:49:18,647 --> 00:49:19,798
I think I could handle it.

733
00:49:19,898 --> 00:49:21,675
Do you mind if he tries it with Barbara?

734
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:23,677
These are new toe shoes.
They're killing me.

735
00:49:23,777 --> 00:49:26,388
Sure. You go ahead and rest.
Barbara, come here. Try it.

736
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:28,599
I think this is what's throwing you off.

737
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,894
If you hold your balance so, like this,
then grab her here by the...

738
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:34,945
Paul, I think we're making
a mistake here.

739
00:49:38,417 --> 00:49:40,360
I think we're wasting Tony
in this scene.

740
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,697
He's got the first-act finale right
after this. The damnation scene.

741
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:45,908
I don't want to dissipate
his impact in that.

742
00:49:46,008 --> 00:49:50,287
Now, why not let him exit into the house
and watch it from his balcony?

743
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:51,914
- How'd that be?
- Wonderful idea.

744
00:49:52,014 --> 00:49:54,500
See what that would do?
Save your sock for the finale.

745
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,793
Much better that way.

746
00:49:55,893 --> 00:49:58,170
PAUL: Let's go back
to the beginning positions. Gaby.

747
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:00,255
Boys, get around up here,
and the girls, yes.

748
00:50:00,355 --> 00:50:02,925
You were down here in the line
like that. Not too close.

749

This group's down here, you're up there.

- Let's try it this way.
- No!

751
00:50:06,778 --> 00:50:09,814
Let's not try it this way
or any other way.

752
00:50:11,366 --> 00:50:15,521
I have had enough. I've had
three weeks of these lovely rehearsals...

753
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:19,107
three weeks of Chinese torture.
I don't know what you're trying to do...

754
00:50:19,207 --> 00:50:21,902
except make me look like
a complete fool. A clumsy idiot.

755
00:50:22,002 --> 00:50:25,322
I've tried. For three weeks, I've tried.
I've taken everything.

756
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:29,034
I've watched my part being changed,
my numbers being cut out day after day...

757
00:50:29,134 --> 00:50:30,410
and I haven't said a word.

758
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,955
Got to be cooperative,
think of the good of the show.

759
00:50:33,055 --> 00:50:35,172
Let's get this straight:

760
00:50:35,349 --> 00:50:39,044
I am not Nijinsky.
I am not Marlon Brando.

I am Mrs. Hunter's little boy, Tony,
song-and-dance man.

I'm supposed to have entertained
millions of people in my time.

763
00:50:45,817 --> 00:50:50,639
And I am not entertained by
this little ballerina's snide insinuations...

764
00:50:50,739 --> 00:50:52,599
that I am a no-talent hoofer.

765
00:50:52,699 --> 00:50:55,727
I am sick of her superior smirk.
I'm sick of her.

766
00:50:55,827 --> 00:50:59,773
I'm sick of Faust. I am sick of this show.
Never mind saying it!

- I don't know. I was...

to keep our heads. It's only a show.

I know. I'm sorry, baby.

00:51:34,574 --> 00:51:37,728
So am I. Let's try
to be sensible about it.

776

- Do you think we should try to find Tony?
- I don't know. What do you think?

- Maybe we should.
- But Jeff said not to.

And, of course,
you mustn't disobey teacher.

someone has got to be at the helm.

But to you, he's 100 percent right
every time.

If you say one more word to me
about Jeff's hypnotic influence on me...

- ...I'll scream.
- He's got you so bulldozed...

We're not quarreling.
We're in complete agreement.

- You must have the wrong apartment.

into my bed of nails.

Oh.

I'm terribly sorry.

That's all right. You couldn't have done it
if I hadn't softened it up for you.

- What?
- Nothing.

- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

That's right. Dancers shouldn't smoke.

- You mind if I do?
- Yes. I mean, it's all right.

in a hotel.

They don't belong to the hotel yet.
They're mine, and they're originals.

about dancing. I'm just a Hollywood actor.

815
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:21,398
No, don't do that.
I'm supposed to apologize to you.

816
00:54:21,783 --> 00:54:23,018
- Oh...
- I mean...

817
00:54:23,118 --> 00:54:25,896
I see, the fellows got together,
stuck a gun in your back...

818
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:29,107
No, it was all my idea.
I just wanted to tell you that...

819
00:54:29,207 --> 00:54:31,443
All right. It was Paul's idea.

820
00:54:31,543 --> 00:54:33,445
Why do I let him push me around?

821
00:54:33,545 --> 00:54:36,239
What do I want to apologize
to you for anyway?

822
00:54:36,339 --> 00:54:38,200
You've been mean to me.

823
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:41,620
You didn't want me in the show
in the first place.

824
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,871
What?

825
00:54:42,971 --> 00:54:45,540
And you think
I'm a dime-a-dozen ballet dancer.

826
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:46,792
No.

827
00:54:46,892 --> 00:54:50,420
And this whole thing's making me
a nervous wreck and no show is worth it.

828
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:53,632
I wouldn't apologize to you
in a million years.

829
00:54:53,732 --> 00:54:57,928
Now, don't do that. Please, just
calm down. Now take it easy. Look.

830
00:54:58,028 --> 00:55:00,722
I thought I was the only nervous wreck
around here...

831
00:55:00,822 --> 00:55:02,724
and all this time
you've been behaving...

832
00:55:02,824 --> 00:55:05,560
I've behaved horribly to you,
and I know it.

833
00:55:05,660 --> 00:55:09,696
I'm not used to behaving horribly.
It's a big strain.

834
00:55:10,498 --> 00:55:13,985
You just misunderstood me, that's all.
I think you're terrific.

835
00:55:14,085 --> 00:55:17,739
I think everything in the show
is probably terrific, except me.

836
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:20,158
I've been scared to death of you...

837
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:23,710
and scared to death
of every last kid in the chorus.

838

Don't be nice to me.

839
00:55:29,643 --> 00:55:32,886
It just makes me seem twice as ugly.

840
00:55:36,066 --> 00:55:39,810
I'd say you were more plain than ugly...

841
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:42,855
- ...but at least you've got talent.
- Thanks.

842
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:45,684
Now look, Gaby. It's just plain silly...

843
00:55:45,784 --> 00:55:48,103
that we have never sat down
and talked this out.

844
00:55:48,203 --> 00:55:51,398

the greatest means of communication...

00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:56,069
- And all we do is snarl at each other.
- I know.

We're from two different worlds,
two eras...

848
00:55:59,214 --> 00:56:02,284
but yet we're supposed
to dance together, work together.

849
00:56:02,384 --> 00:56:04,035
No one consulted us...

850
00:56:04,135 --> 00:56:07,463
but we're the only things that matter
in this whole thing.

telling us what to do.

852
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:15,137
You're right.
We have to do the performing.

that have to get up on that stage...

854

- ...and make idiots out of ourselves.
- Tony, is that what's going to happen?

855
00:56:22,696 --> 00:56:25,807
No. Of course not.
Things are going to be fine.

856
00:56:25,907 --> 00:56:29,436
I have a feeling that everything
is going to be much better from now on.

Yes, I know, but...

858

No. I'm not dressed.
I just came from rehearsal.

in our show or not.

- Lil, how about this cut?
- It's fine.

- I'm already holding down the orchestra.
- Maybe the key's too low.

Ask Lester if Tony
can take it a key higher.

01:21:05,427 --> 01:21:09,289
I believe in what you said. I got
carried away in the wrong direction.

1146
01:21:09,389 --> 01:21:14,301
You've got to be the boss, Tony.
I think you can pull this off brilliantly...

1147
01:21:15,353 --> 01:21:17,888
and I'd like to be a part of it.

1148
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:20,967
Jeff, you're all right.

1149
01:21:21,067 --> 01:21:23,303
I must tell you one thing.
There isn't any money.

1150
01:21:23,403 --> 01:21:26,640
Colonel Todd and the backers
have stolen away into the night.

1151
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:27,891
- We've got backers.
- Who?

1152
01:21:27,991 --> 01:21:30,185
A bunch of painters.
A fellow named Degas from...

1153
01:21:30,285 --> 01:21:33,313
- You wouldn't sell your paintings.
- Sure, they love the theater.

1154
01:21:33,413 --> 01:21:37,484
I figure we need five or six weeks on tour
to do what we have to do with this show.

1155
01:21:37,584 --> 01:21:40,112
- Jeff, would you help us with bookings?
- Of course.

1156
01:21:40,212 --> 01:21:43,615
Hal, have you got paper and pencil?
We can send a telegram.

1157
01:21:43,715 --> 01:21:44,957
(ALL CHATTERING)

1158
01:21:45,884 --> 01:21:48,078
- HAL: Washington? Washington's open.
- TONY: And Boston.

1159
01:21:48,178 --> 01:21:49,329
Boston's very good.

1160
01:21:49,429 --> 01:21:52,708
Can we go to Philadelphia, Detroit,
then come on back to New York?

1161
01:21:52,808 --> 01:21:56,635
- Paul, aren't you excited?
- Yeah. It's wonderful.

1162
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,680
I wish them a lot of luck.

1163
01:22:00,982 --> 01:22:04,518
- This kind of leaves us out.
- Why?

1164
01:22:04,778 --> 01:22:08,056
With Tony doing the dances,
it's not going to be my kind of show.

1165
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:11,108
Yours, either.
I don't want you to do it.

1166
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:15,021
I wouldn't think of leaving
the show, Paul.

1167
01:22:15,121 --> 01:22:20,034
- I've worked too hard on your career to...
- It's my career, and I want to stay.

1168
01:22:21,545 --> 01:22:24,781
I'm taking the 9:00 train
tomorrow morning for New York.

1169
01:22:24,881 --> 01:22:27,041
I expect you to be there.

1170
01:22:28,593 --> 01:22:30,711
Have a nice trip, Paul.

1171
01:22:35,809 --> 01:22:38,635
JEFF: Dancers, singers, the sketches.

1172
01:22:42,482 --> 01:22:45,976
TONY: Listen, kids, it's going
to mean rehearsing every day...

1173
01:22:46,194 --> 01:22:48,388
all day, right up to curtain time.

1174
01:22:48,488 --> 01:22:51,850
We're going to put in new numbers,
and learn them as fast as we can...

1175
01:22:51,950 --> 01:22:54,853
and we're going
to yank out all that junk.

1177
01:22:56,204 --> 01:22:59,691

and it looks pretty good now.

I see a new sun up in a new sky

1182
01:23:26,276 --> 01:23:31,105
And my whole horizon
Has reached a new high

1183
01:23:31,531 --> 01:23:36,228

1184
01:23:36,328 --> 01:23:41,233
But today hear it hum a cheery new song

1185
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:46,154
I dreamed a new dream
I saw a new face

1186
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:51,243
And I'm spreading sunshine
All over the place

1187
01:23:51,343 --> 01:23:56,421
With a new point of view
Here's what greets my eye

I should've realized
There'd be another man

1195
01:24:30,423 --> 01:24:34,960

Before I knew where I was at

1198
01:24:44,896 --> 01:24:49,141
I found myself up on the shelf
And that was that

1199
01:24:49,693 --> 01:24:54,688
I tried to reach the moon
But when I got there

1200
01:24:55,615 --> 01:24:58,977
All that I could get was the air

My feet are back upon the ground

- No, I haven't heard.

At least they haven't mentioned it.

- Wasn't he going to...
- What a rat.

- Just give him a few more years.
- Yeah.

and gets married.

- Is that why you never got married?

about you...
