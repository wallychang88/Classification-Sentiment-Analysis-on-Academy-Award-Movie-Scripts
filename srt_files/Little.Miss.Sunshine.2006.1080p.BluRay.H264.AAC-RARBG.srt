00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,949
The winner of a 30,000-dollar scholarship...

2
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,125
is Miss Louisiana, Erika Schwarz.

3
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,852
And the new Miss America
is Miss Kansas...

00:00:56,913 --> 00:00:58,911
Tara Dawn Holland!

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,352
scholarship...

6
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,999
is Miss Louisiana, Erika Schwarz.

7
00:01:17,936 --> 00:01:19,747
And the new Miss America

8

is Miss Kansas,
Tara Dawn Holland!

9
00:01:24,076 --> 00:01:26,510
There are two kinds
of people in this world...

10
00:01:27,092 --> 00:01:29,728
winners and losers.

11
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:33,095
Inside each and every one of you...

12
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:36,355
at the very core of your being...

13
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:40,479
is a winner
waiting to be awakened...

14
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,699
and unleashed upon the world.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,463
With my nine-step
'Refuse to Lose' program...

16
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:50,033
you now have the necessary
tools and the insights...

17
00:01:50,094 --> 00:01:54,394
and the know-how to put
your losing habits behind you...

18
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:58,391
and to go out and make
your dreams come true.

19
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:02,415
No hesitating.

20
00:02:04,196 --> 00:02:05,290
No complaining.

21
00:02:06,357 --> 00:02:07,317
And no excuses.

22
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,922
I want you to go out
in the world...

23
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:11,584
and I want you to be winners!

24
00:02:13,727 --> 00:02:14,601
Thank you.

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,485
Thank you.

26
00:03:35,205 --> 00:03:36,258
I'm on my way.

27
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:38,724
I don't know how long.

28
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,296
I don't know!

29
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:44,194
Richard, he has
nowhere else to go.

30
00:03:46,954 --> 00:03:48,196
I'm not smoking.

31
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:49,762
I'm not!

32
00:03:50,837 --> 00:03:52,064
Look, I'm at the hospital.

33
00:03:52,842 --> 00:03:53,880
Yeah, okay. Bye.

34
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:19,732
Miss Hoover?

35
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,612
Your brother's fine.

36
00:04:23,489 --> 00:04:24,749
I need you to keep him away

37
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,744
from sharp objects-knives,
scissors.

38
00:04:26,805 --> 00:04:28,086
If you have medications,

39
00:04:28,147 --> 00:04:30,613
depressants in your
house, keep them secure.

40
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,735
-I'd prefer to keep him, but...
-I know. The insurance.

41
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:36,896
You want to see him?

42
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:53,896
Hey, Frank.

43
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,088
Sheryl.

44
00:04:59,538 --> 00:05:00,999
I'm so glad you're still here.

45
00:05:05,274 --> 00:05:06,626
Well, that makes one of us.

46
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:10,897
A strong low pressure system
passed across New Mexico tonight...

47
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:14,501
bringing with it a little moisture
that will cool things off a bit.

48
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,069
We may even see a
five-to 10-degree

49
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,815
drop in temperatures
in Albuquerque.

50
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:20,412
There will be no significant
accumulations of rainfall...

51
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:21,631
Do you want to talk or no?

52
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,683
-Nearly nothing, but statewide 93%-
-No.

53
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,430
Hello?

54
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,158
Anyone?

55
00:05:45,113 --> 00:05:47,059
Down here.
We have you with Dwayne.

56
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,010
Dwayne, hi.
Uncle Frank's here.

57
00:05:58,969 --> 00:06:00,726
He doesn't mind, Frank.
We talked.

58
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,237
Wha... I know. I know.

59
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,690
But we can't have you sleeping alone.
The doctor said.

60
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,797
I'm sorry.
I have to insist.

61
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,649
You'll get along fine.
He's really quiet.

62
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,154
And here's your cot.

63
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,065
Please, Frank.

64
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,473
Please.

65
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:34,300
Thank you.

66
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:36,911
I'm gonna start dinner.

67
00:06:36,972 --> 00:06:37,902
You can come out
when you're settled.

68
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,556
And, uh, just leave
the door open.

69
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:43,151
That's important.

70
00:06:53,912 --> 00:06:55,948
Dwayne, honey, there's
a bucket of chicken in the car.

71
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,296
Can you get it?
And, uh, I'll make a salad.

72
00:06:59,857 --> 00:07:01,596
-Olive?
-Yeah?

73
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:03,633
-Is Grandpa with you?
-Yeah.

74
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:05,980
-What are you guys doing?
-Rehearsing.

75
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,868
-Okay, well, dinner in 10 minutes.
-Okay.

76
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:13,454
-Hi.
-Hi. Frank's here.

77
00:07:13,515 --> 00:07:16,645
Oh, God.
Did, uh, Stan Grossman call?

78
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:17,896
Well, check the machine.

79
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,519
Dwayne, please, come on.
The chicken. It's in the car.

80
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,884
Will you set the table?
We'll do paper plates tonight.

81
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:27,949
Remember Olive was runner-up
in the Little Miss Sunshine?

82
00:07:28,392 --> 00:07:29,825
They just called right now...

83
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,521
Hey, it's your sister!

84
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:33,787
Fuck.

85
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:45,835
Hi. Richard Hoover
for Stan Grossman, please.

86
00:07:46,516 --> 00:07:47,795
Any way to reach him or...

87
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:51,989
Well, I'm just wondering
if this darn book deal is done or not.

88
00:07:52,852 --> 00:07:53,439
If...

89
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:56,224
Yes.

90
00:07:57,408 --> 00:07:58,877
Okay, could you
please just have him

91
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,436
call me anytime
over the weekend?

92
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:01,573
He has my cell number.

93
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,647
Just to let me know we're on.

94
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:07,307
Okay? Thank you. Bye.

95
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:09,649
So what happened
with Stan Grossman?

96
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:11,424
He's in Scottsdale.

97
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:13,020
Why didn't he call?

98
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,854
Will you let me
worry about this, please?

99
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:19,313
Dwayne, can you check on Frank?
Tell him it's dinnertime.

100
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,779
Olive! Dinnertime!

101
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,974
Coming!

102
00:08:30,381 --> 00:08:31,164
What?

103
00:08:31,765 --> 00:08:32,465
Dinner?

104
00:08:36,554 --> 00:08:38,304
What, you don't talk anymore?

105
00:08:40,177 --> 00:08:40,841
Why not?

106
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:44,661
You can talk.
You just choose not to?

107
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:52,700
Is that Nietzsche?

108
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:57,344
You don't speak
because of Friedrich Nietzsche.

109
00:09:04,151 --> 00:09:04,859
Far out.

110
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:14,675
Frank, you can sit
here next to Dwayne.

111
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,276
Here's the salad,

112
00:09:16,337 --> 00:09:19,237
and I'm gonna run and
get Sprite for everyone.

113
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,681
Olive, come on!
Dinnertime!

114
00:09:24,825 --> 00:09:25,760
Okay.

115
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:34,834
So who do you hang out with?

116
00:09:41,652 --> 00:09:42,592
No one?

117
00:09:54,987 --> 00:09:56,309
What about your family?

118
00:10:02,472 --> 00:10:04,431
Frank! Hey!

119
00:10:04,492 --> 00:10:07,909
-Richard.
-Good to... see you.

120
00:10:19,197 --> 00:10:20,652
Let me get Olive.

121
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:25,141
-Olive? Dad?
-You guys, go on and start.

122
00:10:25,202 --> 00:10:27,250
-Let's go!
-We're coming.

123
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,027
-Frank, some Sprite?
-Yes.

124
00:10:29,656 --> 00:10:31,829
And I want everyone to have
at least a little salad.

125
00:10:32,706 --> 00:10:33,598
Thanks, Sheryl.

126
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,204
Honey.

127
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,165
So, Sheryl, I
couldn't help noticing

128
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,352
Dwayne has stopped speaking.

129
00:10:45,531 --> 00:10:48,283
Oh, yeah, he's taken
a vow of silence.

130
00:10:48,895 --> 00:10:50,594
You've taken a vow of silence?

131
00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:52,969
Yeah. He's gonna join
the Air Force Academy,

132
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,079
become a test pilot... and
he's taken a vow of silence

133
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,239
until he reaches that goal.

134
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,202
You're kidding?

135
00:10:58,047 --> 00:10:59,412
Hi, Uncle Frank.

136
00:10:59,473 --> 00:11:02,663
Oh, hey, Olive.
Wow, you're gettin' big.

137
00:11:02,724 --> 00:11:05,370
Almost like a real person.

138
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:10,512
-What happened to your arms?
-Olive.

139
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:12,915
That's all right.
I had a little accident. I'm okay.

140
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:16,198
-How's the, uh, routine coming, honey?
-It's good.

141
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,771
Yeah? When are you
gonna show it to us?

142
00:11:18,434 --> 00:11:20,488
I don't know.
It's up to Grandpa.

143
00:11:20,588 --> 00:11:22,756
A couple of days.
It still needs work.

144
00:11:23,552 --> 00:11:24,751
What's that? Chicken?

145
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:26,967
Every night it's
the fuckin' chicken!

146
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:28,592
Holy God Almighty!

147
00:11:28,653 --> 00:11:30,342
-It is possible just once...
-Dad!

148
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:32,156
we could get something
to eat around here

149
00:11:32,217 --> 00:11:34,177
that's not the goddamn
fucking chicken?

150
00:11:34,238 --> 00:11:35,144
-Hey, Dad!
-I'm just sayin'...

151
00:11:35,205 --> 00:11:35,837
Dad!

152
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:37,733
Christ.

153
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:39,701
When you want to start cooking
your own food, you're welcome.

154
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:41,148
At Sunset Manor, you know...

155
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:42,552
If you like Sunset
Manor so much,

156
00:11:42,613 --> 00:11:44,184
you shouldn't have
got kicked out.

157
00:11:44,851 --> 00:11:46,133
For God's sakes.

158
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,621
So when did you start
with the vow?

159
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:55,680
Been nine months, Frank.

160
00:11:56,353 --> 00:11:57,334
He hasn't said a word.

161
00:11:58,191 --> 00:11:59,068
Not one.

162
00:12:00,464 --> 00:12:02,180
I think it shows
tremendous discipline.

163
00:12:02,241 --> 00:12:03,772
-Richard.
-I really do.

164
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,745
Really. I think we could
learn something from Dwayne.

165
00:12:06,378 --> 00:12:07,266
Dwayne has a goal.

166
00:12:08,246 --> 00:12:09,148
He has a dream.

167
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,131
It may not be my dream,
may not be yours...

168
00:12:12,676 --> 00:12:16,355
but he's pursuing it with
great conviction and focus.

169
00:12:16,609 --> 00:12:18,191
In fact, I was thinking
about the nine steps-

170
00:12:18,252 --> 00:12:19,855
Oh, for crying out loud!

171
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:22,723
About the nine steps and how
Dwayne's utilizing seven of them

172
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,116
in his personal quest
to self-fulfilment.

173
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:24,828
Richard, please.

174
00:12:24,889 --> 00:12:27,231
Well, I'm just saying
I've come around.

175
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:29,235
I think he could use our support.

176
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:32,764
How did it happen?

177
00:12:34,775 --> 00:12:36,447
-How did what happen?
-Your accident.

178
00:12:37,436 --> 00:12:38,375
Honey, here.

179
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:41,100
Oh, no, it's okay.
Unless you object.

180
00:12:42,744 --> 00:12:44,479
No, I'm pro-honesty here.

181
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,231
I just think, you
know, it's up to you.

182
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,412
Be my guest.

183
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:54,535
Olive, um, Uncle Frank
didn't really have an accident.

184
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:56,943
What happened was he...

185
00:12:58,053 --> 00:12:58,839
tried to kill himself.

186
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:00,679
You did?

187
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:02,494
Why?

188
00:13:03,743 --> 00:13:06,014
I'm sorry. I don't think this
is an appropriate conversation.

189
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:08,432
Honey, let's let Uncle Frank
finish his dinner, okay? Shh.

190
00:13:09,578 --> 00:13:11,296
Why did you want
to kill yourself?

191
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:14,805
No, don't answer the question, Frank.

192
00:13:14,866 --> 00:13:17,039
-Richard! Richard!
-He's not gonna answer the question. Frank.

193
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:18,834
-I wanted to kill myself...
-Don't listen to him.

194
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:19,437
Richard!

195
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,765
-I was very unhappy.
-He's sick in his head.

196
00:13:21,826 --> 00:13:22,437
Richard!

197
00:13:22,498 --> 00:13:24,691
I'm sorry! I don't think it's
an appropriate conversation...

198
00:13:24,752 --> 00:13:26,912
-for a seven-year-old.
-She's gonna find out anyway.

199
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:28,164
Okay.

200
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:30,189
Go on, Frank.

201
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,953
Why were you unhappy?

202
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:39,006
Um, well, there are
a lot of reasons.

203
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:42,982
Mainly, though, I fell
in love with someone

204
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:44,737
who didn't love me back.

205
00:13:45,628 --> 00:13:46,348
Who?

206
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,283
One of my grad students.

207
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:50,052
I was very much
in love with him.

208
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,273
Him?

209
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:54,050
It was a boy?

210
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,311
You fell in love with a boy?

211
00:13:56,372 --> 00:13:58,004
Yes, I did. Very much so.

212
00:13:58,835 --> 00:13:59,754
That's silly.

213
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,652
You're right. It was silly.
It was very, very silly.

214
00:14:02,713 --> 00:14:04,297
-There's another word for it.
-Dad.

215
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:08,235
So, that's when you
tried to kill yourself?

216
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:09,844
Well, no.

217
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:11,482
The boy that I was in love with,

218
00:14:11,543 --> 00:14:13,482
fell in love with another
man... Larry Sugarman.

219
00:14:13,543 --> 00:14:15,974
-Who's Larry Sugarman?
-Larry Sugarman is, perhaps...

220
00:14:16,035 --> 00:14:19,195
the second most highly regarded
Proust scholar in the U.S.

221
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,456
Who's number one?

222
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:22,977
That would be me, Rich.

223
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,248
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

224
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,583
So that's when.

225
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,819
No. What happened was
I was a bit upset...

226
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,712
so I said some things
that I shouldn't have said...

227
00:14:32,773 --> 00:14:34,203
and I did some things
that I shouldn't have done...

228
00:14:34,264 --> 00:14:36,415
and subsequently
I was fired from my job...

229
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,956
and forced to move
out of my apartment

230
00:14:38,017 --> 00:14:39,192
and move into a motel.

231
00:14:44,564 --> 00:14:46,457
-And that's when you tried to-
-Well, no.

232
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,489
Actually, all of that was okay.

233
00:14:48,617 --> 00:14:52,105
What happened was two days
ago the MacArthur Foundation,

234
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:53,474
in its infinite wisdom...

235
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:56,392
awarded a genius grant
to Larry Sugarman.

236
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,714
And that's when I...

237
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,017
Decided to check out early.

238
00:15:03,346 --> 00:15:06,038
Yes. Yes. And I failed
at that as well.

239
00:15:07,118 --> 00:15:10,390
Olive, the important thing
to understand here...

240
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:12,969
is that Uncle Frank
gave up on himself.

241
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,451
He made a series
of foolish choices...

242
00:15:15,512 --> 00:15:16,910
I'm sorry... and he
gave up on himself...

243
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,768
which is something winners never do.

244
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:20,740
So that's the story, okay?

245
00:15:20,801 --> 00:15:23,568
Now, everyone, just
let's move on and, uh...

246
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:25,453
Is he always like this?

247
00:15:26,461 --> 00:15:27,543
How can you stand it?

248
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:28,471
Olive,

249
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:31,384
tell him about your routine
while you're doing this.

250
00:15:31,445 --> 00:15:33,956
Okay. Little Miss Chilli
Pepper is a beauty contest

251
00:15:34,138 --> 00:15:35,590
for everyone in Albuquerque...

252
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,532
but you have to be six or seven

253
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:38,959
and you have to be a girl.

254
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:41,030
This is our sister.

255
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,939
-Cindy.
-Spring break.

256
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:45,195
Dwayne went to see his dad
in Florida for two weeks...

257
00:15:45,256 --> 00:15:47,304
and Olive went to Laguna
to see her cousins.

258
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,592
She made it to the top of
the regionals out there.

259
00:15:49,857 --> 00:15:51,039
I was in second place.

260
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,732
Well, what do you think
your chances are?

261
00:15:54,295 --> 00:15:55,405
I think I can win,

262
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,245
because some of
the other girls...

263
00:15:57,419 --> 00:16:01,004
they've been doing it longer,
but I practice every day.

264
00:16:01,329 --> 00:16:02,198
Yeah. Good luck.

265
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,013
Not about luck, Frank.

266
00:16:04,718 --> 00:16:06,702
Luck is the name losers give
to their own failings.

267
00:16:06,763 --> 00:16:09,538
It's about wanting to win,
willing yourself to win.

268
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,389
You've got to want it
badder than anybody else.

269
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:12,283
I do.

270
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,207
-Then you're gonna be a winner.
-Richard.

271
00:16:14,268 --> 00:16:15,245
It's the truth.

272
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,162
You know, actually,

273
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:19,864
there is a message from
Cindy on the machine.

274
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,985
Something about Little Mrs. Sunshine.

275
00:16:23,141 --> 00:16:25,707
-What? Little Miss Sunshine?
-Yeah.

276
00:16:25,768 --> 00:16:26,240
What?

277
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:34,968
Sheryl, it's Cindy.

278
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:36,929
Remember when Olive
was here last month?

279
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:39,428
She was runner-up in the
regional Little Miss Sunshine?

280
00:16:39,787 --> 00:16:40,716
They just called right now

281
00:16:40,777 --> 00:16:42,959
and said that the girl who
won had to forfeit her crown.

282
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,193
I don't know why.
Something about diet pills.

283
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,704
Now she has a place in the
state contest in Redondo Beach!

284
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:54,960
Oh, my gosh! I won!
I won! I won! I won!

285
00:16:55,021 --> 00:16:56,610
-Finish your dinner!
-I'm finished!

286
00:16:56,671 --> 00:16:57,311
What happened?

287
00:16:58,687 --> 00:16:59,594
I'm just calling to... Cindy!

288
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:01,121
Yeah, we just got it.

289
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:03,962
Yeah, she basically went crazy.

290
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:06,586
-I won! I won! I won!
-No, I didn't get that.

291
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:09,204
The machine cut you off. Okay.

292
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,821
Redondo Beach.

293
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:14,349
This Sunday?

294
00:17:14,979 --> 00:17:16,508
Wh... are you guys going?

295
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:18,172
Yes.

296
00:17:18,769 --> 00:17:21,711
-Can you put it off?
-They have to. They have to.

297
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:24,289
-Where does that leave us?
-We can't do it. We can't.

298
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:27,549
No, no... no, I understand
that, Cindy. Yeah.

299
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:31,196
They... I just... No, I'll just
figure it out. Okay, bye-bye.

300
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:34,389
It's this Sunday?
Why can't Jeff and Cindy take her?

301
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,361
They have some equestrian
thing in Santa Barbara.

302
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,152
You know, they do that horse
shit every single weekend.

303
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:40,223
Well, it's the nationals.

304
00:17:40,284 --> 00:17:42,933
They're taking both horses,
so apparently it's a big deal.

305
00:17:43,497 --> 00:17:44,468
What about Olive?

306
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,316
Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine! I won!

307
00:17:51,185 --> 00:17:51,826
I won!

308
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,135
I'm going! We're going!

309
00:17:55,196 --> 00:17:57,284
-You promised?
-We'll fly out and come back Monday.

310
00:17:57,345 --> 00:17:59,955
-How are you gonna get around out there?
-We'll rent a car.

311
00:18:00,016 --> 00:18:02,564
-And stay at a hotel?
-We can afford it.

312
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:06,034
-This is our seed money.
-Well, if I had a little help bringin' it in.

313
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:08,485
-Don't start that.
-It all goes to your nine steps!

314
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,576
I told you I'm gonna talk
to Stan Grossman!

315
00:18:10,637 --> 00:18:12,399
We're gonna get locked
and loaded on this deal

316
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,860
and start generating
some income!

317
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:17,819
-But in the meantime we've gotta be...
-Okay, okay! We'll drive!

318
00:18:17,886 --> 00:18:20,642
-I'm not drivin'.
-How are you gonna fit Grandpa in the Miata?

319
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,882
-Well, Grandpa does not have to come.
-What? I coached her!

320
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:25,766
I gave her the moves.
I gotta go.

321
00:18:25,827 --> 00:18:26,629
Why don't you take the VW?

322
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:29,442
I cannot drive a shift, Richard.
I tried and I cannot do it.

323
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:32,039
-We'll fly there.
-We can't afford it.

324
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,552
Well, that's what we're gonna do
unless you have a better idea.

325
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,903
Here. This is dessert.

326
00:18:42,676 --> 00:18:45,158
I won! I won!
I won! I won! I won!

327
00:18:45,313 --> 00:18:47,376
I won! I won! I won!

328
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:54,772
Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!
Little Miss Sunshine!

329
00:18:56,222 --> 00:18:58,241
All right.
I'll drive the bus.

330
00:18:58,652 --> 00:19:02,206
Richard, I was told explicitly
not to leave Frank by himself.

331
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:03,880
-No offence, Frank.
-None taken.

332
00:19:04,107 --> 00:19:06,597
You got Dwayne here.
They can look after each other.

333
00:19:06,684 --> 00:19:09,613
No, Richard! That's asking too much.
If something happened...

334
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:13,739
We can't go, then, unless
Dwayne and Frank go with us.

335
00:19:14,295 --> 00:19:17,240
-Mom, where's my bathing suit?
-Right.

336
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:19,965
Frank?

337
00:19:21,222 --> 00:19:22,449
I found it!

338
00:19:24,054 --> 00:19:25,195
Okay.

339
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:28,907
I'm going! I'm going!
I'm going!

340
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,857
Oh, Dwayne, come on, please.
Think of your sister.

341
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,067
Come on, Dwayne.
It'll be a lot of fun.

342
00:19:36,585 --> 00:19:38,370
You can go to the beach and...

343
00:19:43,071 --> 00:19:45,828
'This is unfair.

344
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,892
'All I ask is...

345
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,381
that you leave me alone.'

346
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,910
Dwayne, flight school.

347
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,357
I will give you permission
for flight school.

348
00:20:03,546 --> 00:20:08,706
I won! I won! I won! I won!
I'm gonna win this one too!

349
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:20,955
'But I'm not going...

350
00:20:21,116 --> 00:20:24,854
to have any fun.'

351
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,750
Yeah, we're all with you
on that one, Dwayne.

352
00:20:26,811 --> 00:20:30,154
Grandpa! Grandpa!
Is Grandpa coming to California?

353
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:32,280
-We're all coming, honey.
-Hey, uh, hold on.

354
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:34,788
Olive, come over here
for a second.

355
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,586
Come here.
Sit down for a second.

356
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:38,759
Look,

357
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,149
there's no sense in
entering a contest...

358
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,612
if you don't think
you're gonna win.

359
00:20:44,022 --> 00:20:48,592
So do you think you can win
Little Miss Sunshine?

360
00:20:48,653 --> 00:20:49,456
Richard...

361
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:52,762
Are you gonna win?

362
00:20:58,627 --> 00:20:59,209
Yes!

363
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:02,047
We're going to California.

364
00:21:11,387 --> 00:21:12,187
Good night, Dwayne.

365
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,980
Not on your watch.
I wouldn't do that to you.

366
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:44,368
Thank you, Dwayne.

367
00:21:46,316 --> 00:21:48,794
Coming from you,
that means a lot.

368
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:50,767
Good night.

369
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,429
Jesus, I'm tired.

370
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,474
I'm so fucking tired.

371
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,996
Do you know how tired I am?

372
00:22:49,338 --> 00:22:50,600
If some girl came up to me,

373
00:22:50,661 --> 00:22:52,450
begged me to fuck
her, I couldn't do it.

374
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,721
-That's how tired I am.
-Dad? Watch the language, huh?

375
00:22:55,782 --> 00:22:57,000
She's listening to music.

376
00:22:57,846 --> 00:23:00,216
Olive, I'll give you a million
dollars if you turn around.

377
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:02,764
-See?
-All right.

378
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:04,915
-But the rest of us.
-Oh, the rest of you.

379
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,349
Can I give you some advice?

380
00:23:08,656 --> 00:23:10,211
Well, I'm gonna
give it to you anyway.

381
00:23:10,403 --> 00:23:12,004
I don't want you making
the same mistakes

382
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:12,880
I made when I was young.

383
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:14,186
Can't wait to hear this.

384
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:18,036
Dwayne... that's your name, right?
Dwayne?

385
00:23:18,865 --> 00:23:20,918
This is the voice
of experience talking.

386
00:23:21,322 --> 00:23:22,244
Are you listening?

387
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:24,467
Fuck a lot of women, Dwayne.

388
00:23:24,693 --> 00:23:27,454
-Hey! Dad!
-Not just one woman. A lot of women.

389
00:23:27,515 --> 00:23:29,675
-That's enough, all right?
-Are you gettin' any?

390
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:30,259
Dad!

391
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,004
You can tell me, Dwayne.
Are you gettin' any?

392
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:36,210
-Come on, please.
-No? Jesus. You're what, 15?

393
00:23:36,271 --> 00:23:37,813
-My God, man!
-Dad!

394
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,279
You should be
gettin' that young stuff.

395
00:23:39,427 --> 00:23:41,524
That young stuff is
the best in the world.

396
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:42,779
Dad, that's enough! Stop it!

397
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,586
Will you kindly not
interrupt me, Richard?

398
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:48,284
See, right now you're jail-bait.
They're jail-bait. It's perfect.

399
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:49,468
I mean, you hit 18...

400
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:51,486
man, you're talking
about three to five.

401
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:53,662
Hey, I will pull
this truck over right now!

402
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:55,755
So pull the truck over!
You're not gonna shove me out!

403
00:23:55,816 --> 00:23:57,357
Fuck you! I can say what I want.

404
00:23:57,418 --> 00:24:00,037
-I still got Nazi bullets in my ass!
-Ah, the Nazi bullets!

405
00:24:00,098 --> 00:24:02,178
You're as bad as those
fuckers at Sunset Manor.

406
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:07,371
-What happened at Sunset Manor?
-Frank, don't encourage him.

407
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:08,914
What happened? I'll
tell you what happened.

408
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:11,202
I paid my money.
They took my money.

409
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,230
I should be able to do
what the fuck I want!

410
00:24:13,681 --> 00:24:16,513
-He started snorting heroin.
-You started snorting heroin?

411
00:24:16,574 --> 00:24:18,727
-I'm old!
-Well, that stuff'll kill you.

412
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,927
What am I, an idiot?

413
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:21,459
And don't you start
taking that shit.

414
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,669
When you're young,
you're crazy to do that stuff.

415
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:24,695
What about you?

416
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:26,099
What about me? I'm old.

417
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,064
When you're old, you're
crazy not to do it.

418
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:29,516
We've tried. Believe me.

419
00:24:29,577 --> 00:24:31,991
The intervention was a fiasco.
He's worse than a two-year-old.

420
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:34,250
Can we please talk
about something else?

421
00:24:35,111 --> 00:24:37,257
I take it you didn't
like it at Sunset Manor.

422
00:24:37,318 --> 00:24:37,750
Frank.

423
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:39,616
Are you kidding me?
It was a fuckin' paradise.

424
00:24:40,133 --> 00:24:42,193
They got a pool.
They got golf.

425
00:24:42,254 --> 00:24:45,383
Now I'm stuck with Mr. Happy here,
sleepin' on a fuckin' sofa.

426
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,237
Look, I know you're
a homo and all,

427
00:24:48,298 --> 00:24:49,710
but maybe you can
appreciate this.

428
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:51,183
You go to one of those places,

429
00:24:51,353 --> 00:24:53,425
there's four women
for every guy.

430
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,987
Can you imagine
what that's like?

431
00:24:55,447 --> 00:24:56,369
You must've been very busy.

432
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,987
Whoa! I had second-degree
burns on my Johnson.

433
00:24:59,048 --> 00:24:59,905
I kid you not.

434
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,495
-Really?
-Forget about it.

435
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,879
What are you guys talking about?

436
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:05,911
Politics.

437
00:25:06,156 --> 00:25:06,790
Oh.

438
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:13,769
Fuck a lot of women, kid.
I have no reason to lie to you.

439
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,232
Not one woman.
A lot of women.

440
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:19,666
You heard what I said?

441
00:25:20,546 --> 00:25:21,772
Did it go in anywhere?

442
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,603
Yeah, I think
we get the point, Dad.

443
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:26,454
Don't show me the pad.
I don't want to see the fuckin' pad.

444
00:25:30,459 --> 00:25:32,226
Mom, how much can we spend?

445
00:25:32,472 --> 00:25:34,119
I would say four dollars.

446
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:35,723
Anything under four dollars.

447
00:25:36,629 --> 00:25:38,188
Hi. You ready?

448
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:41,583
Yeah, I'm gonna have the,
uh, number five with coffee, please.

449
00:25:41,644 --> 00:25:42,431
All right.

450
00:25:43,337 --> 00:25:46,998
A number seven, over easy,
and a grapefruit juice.

451
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:50,406
-Grapefruit. Okay.
-I would like a fruit plate.

452
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:52,326
-And do you have chamomile?
-Yes.

453
00:25:52,831 --> 00:25:56,491
-With honey, please.
-I would like the lumberjack and coffee.

454
00:25:56,788 --> 00:25:58,713
-And extra bacon.
-Extra.

455
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:01,598
-Now, Dad, you should probably...
-Richard, don't start.

456
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,740
-He's gonna kill himself.
-Well, it's his life.

457
00:26:04,048 --> 00:26:06,309
-Thank you, Sheryl.
-Garden salad?

458
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,236
And you.

459
00:26:08,477 --> 00:26:11,592
-I... I'm sorry. I, um-Sorry.
-Take your time.

460
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:14,070
Don't apologize, Olive.
It's a sign of weakness.

461
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,645
Um, well, I want...

462
00:26:16,713 --> 00:26:18,318
Okay, okay. I know what I want.
I know.

463
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:22,609
Okay, can I get
the waffles and, uh...

464
00:26:22,866 --> 00:26:25,197
I don't...
What does 'alamodey' mean?

465
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:28,283
-Oh, that means it comes with ice cream.
-Okay, 'alamodey' then.

466
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:29,634
Olive, for breakfast?

467
00:26:30,478 --> 00:26:32,543
You said four dollars.

468
00:26:32,687 --> 00:26:34,938
Okay. You're right.
Thank you.

469
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:36,385
Okay. Be right back.

470
00:26:37,036 --> 00:26:40,526
Actually, Olive,
'a la mode' in French...

471
00:26:40,596 --> 00:26:43,800
translates literally
as 'in the fashion.'

472
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,951
a la mode.

473
00:26:46,546 --> 00:26:48,560
'Mode' is derived
from Latin modus,

474
00:26:48,934 --> 00:26:50,476
meaning 'due or proper measure.'

475
00:26:50,586 --> 00:26:52,115
-Frank, shut up.
-Richard!

476
00:26:52,345 --> 00:26:54,653
Olive, can I tell you a little
something about ice cream?

477
00:26:54,765 --> 00:26:58,144
-Yeah.
-Well, ice cream is made from cream...

478
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,001
which comes from cow's milk...

479
00:27:00,062 --> 00:27:02,899
and cream has a lot of fat in it.

480
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:05,080
-Richard.
-What?

481
00:27:05,141 --> 00:27:07,062
She's gonna find out
anyway, remember?

482
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,949
What? Find out what?

483
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,597
Well, when you eat ice cream,

484
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:14,000
the fat in the ice cream
becomes fat in your body.

485
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:15,833
-Richard, I swear to God-
-It's true.

486
00:27:15,894 --> 00:27:18,294
-What? What's wrong?
-Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.

487
00:27:18,355 --> 00:27:22,451
So if you eat a lot of ice cream,
you might become fat.

488
00:27:22,764 --> 00:27:26,604
And if you don't, you're gonna
stay nice and skinny, sweetie.

489
00:27:27,085 --> 00:27:29,167
-Mom...
-Olive, Richard is an idiot.

490
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:31,470
I like a woman
with meat on her bones.

491
00:27:31,748 --> 00:27:34,020
I don't... why's everyone so upset?

492
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,972
No, no one's upset, honey. I...

493
00:27:37,125 --> 00:27:38,978
I just want you to understand...

494
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,208
it's okay to be skinny,

495
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:42,454
and it's okay to be fat, if
that's what you want to be.

496
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:44,627
Whatever you want, it's okay.

497
00:27:45,717 --> 00:27:48,001
Okay, but, Olive,
let me ask you this.

498
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,887
Those women in Miss America...

499
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:56,002
Are they skinny,
or are they fat?

500
00:27:57,674 --> 00:27:58,439
Honey?

501
00:27:59,907 --> 00:28:00,650
Well,

502
00:28:02,421 --> 00:28:03,697
they're skinny, I guess.

503
00:28:03,758 --> 00:28:06,369
Yeah. I guess they don't
eat a lot of ice cream.

504
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:09,135
Okay. Coffee.

505
00:28:10,031 --> 00:28:10,860
Coffee.

506
00:28:12,363 --> 00:28:13,924
-Grapefruit.
-Thank you.

507
00:28:14,582 --> 00:28:15,385
Chamomile.

508
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,431
And here's your ice cream.

509
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,448
'Alamodey,' right?

510
00:28:20,117 --> 00:28:21,642
I'll be back with your
waffles in a second.

511
00:28:25,843 --> 00:28:27,643
Does anyone want my ice cream?

512
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:30,285
Yeah, I'd like a little.

513
00:28:30,432 --> 00:28:31,473
Dwayne? Frank?

514
00:28:31,857 --> 00:28:33,533
Olive's not gonna
have her ice cream.

515
00:28:33,594 --> 00:28:34,702
Do you mind if I have a little?

516
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:37,033
-Yeah, let's dig in.
-That looks really good.

517
00:28:37,093 --> 00:28:39,363
Boy, I feel sorry for
anybody that doesn't want

518
00:28:39,424 --> 00:28:41,703
to enjoy their ice cream
so early in the morning.

519
00:28:41,764 --> 00:28:42,844
Boy, that looks good.

520
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:44,647
You sure you don't
wanna have some, Olive?

521
00:28:44,894 --> 00:28:47,601
Those waffles are gonna be
awful lonely in there.

522
00:28:47,662 --> 00:28:49,944
-Mmm! Mmm!
-Watch this.

523
00:28:50,132 --> 00:28:52,928
Wait! Stop!
Don't eat it all.

524
00:28:58,602 --> 00:28:59,721
-All right, Olive...
-Richard!

525
00:29:04,781 --> 00:29:06,426
Hey, Stan!

526
00:29:07,197 --> 00:29:08,655
Stan, it's Richard.

527
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:11,059
Again. Listen,
I know you're busy...

528
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,741
but we're just dying to hear

529
00:29:12,802 --> 00:29:14,419
what sort of numbers you
came up with in Scottsdale.

530
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,132
So, uh, give me a call, please.

531
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:18,369
Hey, did you get him?

532
00:29:18,701 --> 00:29:20,928
No, I can't get a signal out of this thing.

533
00:29:23,711 --> 00:29:25,188
How long till we get there?

534
00:29:25,249 --> 00:29:28,022
-A long time, honey.
-I know. But how long?

535
00:29:28,083 --> 00:29:31,784
Well, we gotta do 600 miles of driving
today and 200 tomorrow.

536
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:34,766
-That's a lot of driving. Let's go.
-I'll drive for a while.

537
00:29:34,913 --> 00:29:37,869
-No, no. I got it.
-No. I gotta learn how to do this.

538
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,920
I mean, you're doing it.
How hard can it be?

539
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:46,177
-Push the stick down hard.
-I'm pushing hard.

540
00:29:47,848 --> 00:29:48,990
Okay. Okay, there you go.

541
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:51,510
Now push the clutch in
all the way to the floor.

542
00:29:51,571 --> 00:29:52,636
It's on the floor.

543
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,550
The floor.

544
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:05,330
Sticking on there.

545
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:06,624
Push down hard.

546
00:30:11,722 --> 00:30:13,950
Well, you've got a problem.

547
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:17,164
Your clutch is, uh, shot.

548
00:30:18,544 --> 00:30:19,611
Can we get a new one?

549
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:23,548
These old buses, you...
you have to order the part.

550
00:30:24,259 --> 00:30:25,298
How long does it take?

551
00:30:26,161 --> 00:30:27,976
Well, it's the weekend...

552
00:30:28,606 --> 00:30:33,812
so... maybe... Thursday.

553
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:49,926
Is there a, uh,

554
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:52,765
dealership around here?

555
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,633
Well, uh, they're
probably gonna be closed.

556
00:30:56,694 --> 00:30:58,634
It's, uh...
It's the weekend, you know.

557
00:30:58,695 --> 00:31:00,153
Yes, we're aware of that.

558
00:31:02,379 --> 00:31:05,080
I'll tell you what. You know these...
these old buses?

559
00:31:05,734 --> 00:31:08,570
You don't need the
clutch to change from...

560
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:10,479
from the third to the fourth.

561
00:31:10,783 --> 00:31:12,688
You only really need the clutch

562
00:31:12,749 --> 00:31:14,873
to go from number
one to number two.

563
00:31:15,488 --> 00:31:17,520
But as long as you keep
parking on a hill...

564
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,352
and you let it go,

565
00:31:19,641 --> 00:31:22,277
and it goes 15, 20
miles per hour...

566
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,098
you start her in third,
and you go from third to fourth.

567
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:28,838
What if you're not
on a hill? There's no hill.

568
00:31:28,899 --> 00:31:30,379
What if there's no hill?
What do you...

569
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:32,407
Yeah, it's...

570
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:39,609
Olive,

571
00:31:40,543 --> 00:31:42,594
Dad, I want you
in the car first.

572
00:31:43,116 --> 00:31:45,322
-I know. We know.
-All right, here we go!

573
00:31:48,065 --> 00:31:49,030
Everybody push!

574
00:31:49,856 --> 00:31:50,642
All right.

575
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:55,046
Here we go! Push! Push!

576
00:31:56,185 --> 00:31:59,039
Okay... okay... okay!

577
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,967
I just want everyone here to know...

578
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:04,644
that I am the pre-eminent
Proust scholar in the United States.

579
00:32:04,705 --> 00:32:05,600
Here we go!

580
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,504
-Go on, honey.
-I'm putting it in gear!

581
00:32:09,684 --> 00:32:11,202
-Go, honey!
-Come on!

582
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:13,413
Come on, Olive!
Run! Run! Come on!

583
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:15,619
-Come on!
-Sheryl, let's go!

584
00:32:16,255 --> 00:32:16,954
Sheryl!

585
00:32:21,825 --> 00:32:22,860
-Frank, let's go!
-I'm coming.

586
00:32:23,802 --> 00:32:26,266
-You're losing them. Slow down!
-I can't slow down!

587
00:32:26,327 --> 00:32:29,317
Come on! Come on! Come
on, you dumb bastard!

588
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:30,525
I can't. I can't slow down.

589
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:32,131
-I can't slow down!
-Let's go!

590
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:34,297
Help him. Come on!

591
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,630
Come on. Come on. Get in.

592
00:32:40,968 --> 00:32:42,455
No one gets left behind.

593
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:44,165
-Close the door!
-No one gets left behind!

594
00:32:44,324 --> 00:32:46,184
Outstanding, soldier!
Outstanding!

595
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,011
Outstanding.

596
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,413
-Was that fun?
-Yeah.

597
00:33:47,306 --> 00:33:48,845
So finally I'm just sitting there...

598
00:33:49,081 --> 00:33:50,268
and I decide, you know,

599
00:33:50,426 --> 00:33:52,010
'This is Stan Grossman.
What the hell?'

600
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:54,202
And I start pitching him
the nine steps.

601
00:33:54,307 --> 00:33:55,205
And about...

602
00:33:55,718 --> 00:33:58,563
I don't know... two minutes
in, he stops me, he says...

603
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:01,067
'I can sell this.'

604
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:02,908
Mm-hmm. Interesting.

605
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,660
Yeah, and this is the guy who
knows how to do it, you know.

606
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:08,050
You start with a book, and
then you do a media tour,

607
00:34:08,443 --> 00:34:11,095
corporate events,
DVD, VHS series.

608
00:34:11,156 --> 00:34:12,820
I mean, there's a whole
fascinating science

609
00:34:12,881 --> 00:34:14,800
into how you roll
these things out.

610
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:15,509
Wow.

611
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:17,795
Yeah, so he's in Scottsdale
right now, you know...

612
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:21,142
building the buzz and kind of getting
the whole hype thing going.

613
00:34:21,203 --> 00:34:25,053
He's doing what the pros call
a ticking clock auction.

614
00:34:25,683 --> 00:34:27,805
Oh, how about that!

615
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:35,629
Yeah, and I can detect
that note of sarcasm there, Frank.

616
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,722
What sarcasm? I didn't...
I didn't hear it.

617
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:39,856
But I want you
to know something.

618
00:34:41,209 --> 00:34:42,469
I feel sorry for you.

619
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,410
You do? Good.

620
00:34:44,471 --> 00:34:47,561
Yeah, I do. Because sarcasm
is the refuge of losers.

621
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,044
-It is? Really?
-Yep.

622
00:34:50,781 --> 00:34:53,983
Sarcasm is losers trying to bring
winners down to their level...

623
00:34:54,044 --> 00:34:55,574
and that's step four in the program.

624
00:34:55,642 --> 00:34:57,963
Wow, Richard, you've really opened
my eyes to what a loser I am.

625
00:34:58,024 --> 00:35:00,121
How much do I owe you for
those pearls of wisdom?

626
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:01,314
That one's on the house.

627
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:04,205
-Okay, you guys, that's enough.
-It's on the house.

628
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:07,021
-That was for free?
-No charge. No charge.

629
00:35:07,082 --> 00:35:09,015
-Stop it!
-He started it.

630
00:35:09,311 --> 00:35:10,758
That's... oh, wait a second.

631
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:12,917
-You are so bad.
-Quiet. This is it. This is that call.

632
00:35:15,069 --> 00:35:15,912
He... hello?

633
00:35:17,459 --> 00:35:18,105
Stan?

634
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:20,927
Stan?

635
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:30,266
Stan Grossman?

636
00:35:31,032 --> 00:35:31,931
Richard Hoover.

637
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:33,595
Finally.

638
00:35:34,305 --> 00:35:35,237
How're ya doin'?

639
00:35:35,818 --> 00:35:38,030
No, I know. We were,
uh, on the highway,

640
00:35:38,091 --> 00:35:40,232
and I lost you on my cell. Forget about it.
How'd we do?

641
00:35:47,423 --> 00:35:49,523
Honey, I'm gonna use the ladies' room.
You need to go?

642
00:35:49,787 --> 00:35:52,924
No. I'm gonna go practice
my routine over there.

643
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,954
Okay, well, don't go too far.

644
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,911
Well, I think that we just
gotta talk to him a little.

645
00:35:59,565 --> 00:36:00,606
No, you gotta talk to him.

646
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,042
No, Stan, listen to me.
Hold on now.

647
00:36:04,317 --> 00:36:06,414
I am going to get something to drink.
You want anything?

648
00:36:06,475 --> 00:36:09,758
-Stay positive and...
-Yeah, get me some porn.

649
00:36:10,063 --> 00:36:10,687
Okay.

650
00:36:11,603 --> 00:36:13,247
Get me something
really nasty too.

651
00:36:13,308 --> 00:36:14,813
I don't want any of
that airbrushed shit.

652
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:15,664
Okay.

653
00:36:15,725 --> 00:36:18,035
Okay, here's a 20. Get
yourself a little treat too.

654
00:36:18,096 --> 00:36:22,287
-Get yourself a fag rag.
-All right. I will.

655
00:36:24,822 --> 00:36:25,963
Uh, that one.

656
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:27,972
Yes. And that one.

657
00:36:28,336 --> 00:36:31,261
And I would like
that one... no, down.

658
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:34,633
Yes. Yes. Yes.
I would like that one.

659
00:36:34,786 --> 00:36:37,476
And, uh, I will have a...

660
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,536
a blue raspberry Slushee.

661
00:36:41,737 --> 00:36:42,323
Frank?

662
00:36:43,795 --> 00:36:45,612
Oh, my God! How are you?

663
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,615
Uh... I thought you were
gonna be in Santa Fe

664
00:36:47,676 --> 00:36:49,263
for the conference.
I was looking for you.

665
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:53,304
-Aren't you supposed to be in New Haven?
-Yeah.

666
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:56,343
Well, you heard about Larry and
the whole genius thing, right?

667
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:57,090
Yeah.

668
00:36:57,195 --> 00:36:59,071
-It's official.
-Oh, good.

669
00:36:59,152 --> 00:37:01,892
So we're going to this private
spa in Sedona for the week...

670
00:37:02,697 --> 00:37:03,920
-Larry's here?
-Yeah.

671
00:37:04,879 --> 00:37:06,534
He's out filling the tank.
He's, uh...

672
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:08,396
Oh. Yeah, there he is.

673
00:37:08,785 --> 00:37:09,477
Wow.

674
00:37:10,237 --> 00:37:12,134
I can't believe this.
How have you been?

675
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:13,667
I've been fine.

676
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:17,294
Good. Good.

677
00:37:17,355 --> 00:37:18,198
You know, I heard

678
00:37:19,395 --> 00:37:20,889
that you got fired.

679
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:24,673
Yeah. No, I quit, 'cause
enough is enough, you know?

680
00:37:24,734 --> 00:37:26,644
Right. Good. Good.

681
00:37:28,219 --> 00:37:29,326
So what are you up to now?

682
00:37:30,074 --> 00:37:33,044
Um, I'm weighing my options...

683
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:35,881
and, um, just, you know,

684
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:38,446
taking some time off, and so...

685
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,340
Great. That's great.

686
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,076
$19.79, sir.

687
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,759
So...

688
00:37:51,809 --> 00:37:53,860
-Well, it was great to see you.
-Yeah, you too.

689
00:37:55,557 --> 00:37:56,923
-Take care of yourself.
-You too.

690
00:37:57,266 --> 00:37:57,762
Bye.

691
00:38:26,715 --> 00:38:27,297
Hey.

692
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:29,612
You forgot your Slushee.

693
00:38:33,622 --> 00:38:35,118
You're in Scottsdale
right now, right?

694
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:37,565
Okay, I can come by.

695
00:38:37,795 --> 00:38:39,090
I'm gonna be coming
through there.

696
00:38:39,151 --> 00:38:40,146
I could swing right by.
We could...

697
00:38:42,844 --> 00:38:44,815
Christ.
He's not getting it.

698
00:38:48,424 --> 00:38:49,522
Did you try that?

699
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:53,436
Listen to what I'm saying, Stan!
I'll... I'll...

700
00:39:00,061 --> 00:39:00,701
So what happened?

701
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:03,935
Nothing.
Let's get out of here.

702
00:39:04,401 --> 00:39:06,980
Wait a minute. I thought
you said this was a done deal.

703
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,980
-He said it was a done deal.
-What, you didn't get anything?

704
00:39:10,173 --> 00:39:12,022
Oh, my God!
Where does that leave us?

705
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,298
Fucked.
That's where it leaves us.

706
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,463
I can't believe I'm hearing...
Did you even try negotiating?

707
00:39:16,524 --> 00:39:17,945
Yes! Of course I tried!
What do you think I...

708
00:39:20,995 --> 00:39:23,445
Let's just go, okay? Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

709
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:30,165
Let's go!

710
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:09,703
'Where's Olive?'

711
00:40:12,587 --> 00:40:13,534
Oh!

712
00:40:25,197 --> 00:40:25,983
All right, Frank.

713
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:27,504
-Come on, Olive.
-Come on, Olive.

714
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:29,447
Come on, sweetie, jump.
Jump in the car.

715
00:40:29,508 --> 00:40:32,316
-We can't stop. Jump.
-I got her! I got her!

716
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:54,068
Richard.

717
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:57,490
Yeah.

718
00:40:58,987 --> 00:40:59,874
Whatever happens,

719
00:41:00,507 --> 00:41:02,321
you tried to do
something on your own...

720
00:41:02,957 --> 00:41:04,863
which is more than
most people ever do...

721
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:07,301
and I include myself
in that category.

722
00:41:09,649 --> 00:41:11,101
You took a big chance.

723
00:41:11,453 --> 00:41:13,353
That took guts, and
I'm proud of you.

724
00:41:16,826 --> 00:41:18,563
Okay, Dad.
Thank you.

725
00:41:30,016 --> 00:41:30,882
Thank you, Dad.

726
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:07,827
Okay, here is 11.

727
00:42:08,284 --> 00:42:09,629
Frank, you're 12.

728
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,052
And Grandpa's 13.

729
00:42:14,567 --> 00:42:16,477
Can I sleep with Grandpa tonight?

730
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,211
Well, you'll have to ask Grandpa.

731
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:19,925
-Grandpa?
-I got two beds.

732
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:22,488
You could still use some rehearsing.

733
00:42:22,717 --> 00:42:24,495
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

734
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:34,162
All right, everybody,
we have a long day tomorrow.

735
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,825
I'll knock on your doors at 7:00 a.m.

736
00:42:38,045 --> 00:42:39,451
That means no lolly-gagging.

737
00:42:40,723 --> 00:42:42,949
We need to be packed
and on the road by 7:40, guys.

738
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,156
-Frank, you guys'll be okay?
-Yeah, we're fine.

739
00:42:45,217 --> 00:42:46,836
-Okay, well, good night.
-Good night.

740
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:47,894
Sleep tight.

741
00:42:49,048 --> 00:42:49,788
Okay.

742
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:09,018
What a fucking nightmare.

743
00:43:10,971 --> 00:43:13,098
Richard, we... we have to talk.

744
00:43:14,568 --> 00:43:15,301
Please.

745
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:17,483
Sheryl,

746
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:21,306
let's just get through
this and go home.

747
00:43:21,489 --> 00:43:23,285
No, Richard, we have to talk now!

748
00:43:23,346 --> 00:43:25,477
I tried to tell you
we couldn't afford this trip!

749
00:43:25,538 --> 00:43:28,969
-Do you realize we're becoming bankrupt?
-We are not bankrupt!

750
00:43:30,477 --> 00:43:33,267
Hey, don't listen to that.

751
00:43:33,581 --> 00:43:35,251
Let's turn on the tube.

752
00:43:36,241 --> 00:43:37,748
We agree that the right man
to preserve the traditions...

753
00:43:37,809 --> 00:43:38,875
I'm gonna brush my teeth.

754
00:43:41,262 --> 00:43:43,344
Secretary Rumsfeld and I
thought long and hard...

755
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:44,867
about this important choice.

756
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:45,806
To me...

757
00:43:45,867 --> 00:43:48,999
You said this was a lock!
You said it was a done deal!

758
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,818
Stan Grossman said it was a done deal!

759
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,723
I'm not married to Stan Grossman!

760
00:43:53,784 --> 00:43:57,253
I trusted him! You gotta trust
to be trusted! That's step six!

761
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:59,714
Oh, fuck the nine steps, Richard!

762
00:43:59,922 --> 00:44:02,738
They're not working!
Forget it! It's over!

763
00:44:02,799 --> 00:44:05,237
I never want to hear
about the nine steps again!

764
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:17,913
Perfect. Perfect. You're
the world champion growler.

765
00:44:18,109 --> 00:44:19,691
Time for your beauty rest.
Get in there.

766
00:44:27,035 --> 00:44:28,287
There you go.

767
00:44:30,512 --> 00:44:31,355
Good night.

768
00:44:32,429 --> 00:44:33,881
-Grandpa?
-Yeah.

769
00:44:36,389 --> 00:44:38,247
I'm kinda scared about tomorrow.

770
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:39,522
Are you kiddin' me?

771
00:44:39,583 --> 00:44:40,917
You're gonna blow
'em out of the water.

772
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,277
They're not gonna know
what hit 'em.

773
00:44:44,235 --> 00:44:45,732
-Grandpa?
-Yeah.

774
00:44:48,206 --> 00:44:49,444
Am I pretty?

775
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:50,252
Olive,

776
00:44:53,102 --> 00:44:54,027
you are...

777
00:44:54,535 --> 00:44:56,955
the most beautiful girl
in the whole world.

778
00:44:58,002 --> 00:44:59,768
Nah, you're just saying that.

779
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:01,490
No, I'm not. I'm madly
in love with you.

780
00:45:01,551 --> 00:45:04,027
And it's not because of your brains
or your personality.

781
00:45:04,151 --> 00:45:05,747
It's because you're beautiful,

782
00:45:06,097 --> 00:45:07,316
inside and out.

783
00:45:09,424 --> 00:45:11,137
-Grandpa?
-What?

784
00:45:15,718 --> 00:45:17,148
I don't want to be a loser.

785
00:45:17,591 --> 00:45:18,623
You're not a loser.

786
00:45:18,684 --> 00:45:20,352
Where'd you get the idea
you're a loser?

787
00:45:21,281 --> 00:45:22,057
Because...

788
00:45:23,493 --> 00:45:24,838
Daddy hates losers.

789
00:45:24,899 --> 00:45:27,043
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Back up a minute.

790
00:45:27,104 --> 00:45:28,613
You know what a loser is?

791
00:45:29,294 --> 00:45:32,582
A real loser is somebody that's
so afraid of not winning,

792
00:45:32,943 --> 00:45:34,264
they don't even try.

793
00:45:35,611 --> 00:45:36,957
Now, you're trying, right?

794
00:45:38,434 --> 00:45:38,981
Yeah.

795
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:40,214
Well, then, you're not a loser.

796
00:45:40,743 --> 00:45:42,226
We're gonna have
fun tomorrow, right?

797
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:44,127
Yeah.

798
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:48,700
We can tell 'em
all to go to hell.

799
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,809
Good night, sweetie.
I love you.

800
00:46:14,506 --> 00:46:15,346
What are you doing?

801
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:18,595
I'm gonna fix this.

802
00:46:21,817 --> 00:46:22,566
Richard...

803
00:46:24,928 --> 00:46:25,990
I'm gonna fix this.

804
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:56,786
Here we go.

805
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,213
Here we go.

806
00:47:23,436 --> 00:47:24,159
Hi.

807
00:48:41,561 --> 00:48:42,906
Hi. Stan Grossman, please.

808
00:48:48,486 --> 00:48:49,731
Stan, it's Richard.

809
00:48:49,806 --> 00:48:51,023
I don't know where
the fuck you are.

810
00:48:51,084 --> 00:48:52,178
I'm at the hotel.
Call me.

811
00:49:12,939 --> 00:49:13,982
But it's funny.

812
00:49:17,542 --> 00:49:18,141
So I said,

813
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:20,209
'You want me to teach you
about life experiences?

814
00:49:20,742 --> 00:49:22,682
You can write a book
about my experiences.'

815
00:49:23,382 --> 00:49:24,453
So he says to me...

816
00:49:28,659 --> 00:49:29,657
Hello, Stan.

817
00:49:30,272 --> 00:49:31,883
You're the one
that said it would sell!

818
00:49:31,944 --> 00:49:33,655
That's what I thought at the time.

819
00:49:33,871 --> 00:49:34,951
But it's a great program.

820
00:49:35,012 --> 00:49:37,655
You said so yourself.
I don't understand.

821
00:49:37,716 --> 00:49:39,434
It's not the program, Richard.

822
00:49:39,928 --> 00:49:41,834
It's you. Okay?

823
00:49:42,558 --> 00:49:44,299
No one's heard of you.

824
00:49:44,759 --> 00:49:46,096
Nobody cares.

825
00:49:53,618 --> 00:49:54,892
What's the next step?

826
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:56,826
There is none.

827
00:49:57,756 --> 00:49:58,746
We had our shot.

828
00:49:59,298 --> 00:50:01,207
It didn't fly. We move on.

829
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:03,289
You... you mean give up?

830
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:04,084
Richard.

831
00:50:04,454 --> 00:50:05,386
Hey, wh...

832
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:09,257
Whoa, hey! One setback here,
and you're ready to just quit?

833
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:10,120
Richard, listen.

834
00:50:10,696 --> 00:50:12,383
I pushed this thing hard, okay?

835
00:50:12,444 --> 00:50:13,766
I rammed it down
their fucking throats,

836
00:50:13,827 --> 00:50:15,274
and no one bought it!

837
00:50:16,797 --> 00:50:18,632
It's time to move on.

838
00:50:19,248 --> 00:50:20,654
You're not gonna win this one.

839
00:50:23,743 --> 00:50:25,845
Okay. Okay.
You know what?

840
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:28,261
Good. I'm glad.
You know why?

841
00:50:28,947 --> 00:50:31,149
Because this is what
the nine steps are all about.

842
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:33,550
-Right here, Stan. Right here!
-Richard.

843
00:50:33,756 --> 00:50:35,379
-Richard, please.
-You blew it!

844
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:37,676
You blew it.
You're out.

845
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:47,503
Mom?

846
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:50,465
Dad?

847
00:50:55,453 --> 00:50:56,693
What is it, hon?

848
00:50:58,282 --> 00:50:59,541
Grandpa won't wake up.

849
00:51:15,848 --> 00:51:17,196
Want to take an eye test?

850
00:51:18,678 --> 00:51:20,163
Uncle Frank?
An eye test?

851
00:51:23,484 --> 00:51:25,167
Olive, come here.
Put those away.

852
00:51:25,268 --> 00:51:26,694
We're gonna have
a family meeting.

853
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:28,303
Dwayne, family meeting.

854
00:51:33,165 --> 00:51:34,269
First of all...

855
00:51:35,081 --> 00:51:36,982
the doctors are doing everything

856
00:51:37,043 --> 00:51:38,958
they can to help
Grandpa right now.

857
00:51:39,704 --> 00:51:41,159
He's had a long,

858
00:51:41,959 --> 00:51:43,194
eventful life...

859
00:51:44,014 --> 00:51:46,325
and I know he loves
both of you very much.

860
00:51:47,372 --> 00:51:48,763
But if God wants to take him,

861
00:51:48,824 --> 00:51:50,664
we have to be ready
to accept that, okay?

862
00:51:53,563 --> 00:51:54,950
Whatever happens,

863
00:51:56,616 --> 00:51:57,761
we're a family.

864
00:51:59,707 --> 00:52:02,049
And what's important
is that we love each other.

865
00:52:02,794 --> 00:52:05,490
I love you guys so, so much.

866
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:28,903
Look at this.
This is a 15-pound turkey.

867
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:31,279
It does it in three hours' time.

868
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,684
Are you the family
of Edwin Hoover?

869
00:52:37,765 --> 00:52:38,485
Yes.

870
00:52:41,264 --> 00:52:42,326
I'm sorry.

871
00:52:43,346 --> 00:52:44,669
We did everything we could.

872
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:46,955
He was, uh...

873
00:52:48,441 --> 00:52:49,562
well, it was too much.

874
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,783
He probably just fell asleep
and never woke up.

875
00:52:56,902 --> 00:52:59,787
I'll have someone come talk to you
about handling the remains.

876
00:53:05,164 --> 00:53:05,896
Thank you.

877
00:53:16,004 --> 00:53:16,745
Linda!

878
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:24,574
Mom?

879
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:27,407
Is Grandpa dead?

880
00:53:27,881 --> 00:53:30,190
Yeah, honey.
He passed away.

881
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:40,570
That's what this machine does.
Chicken, fish or beef.

882
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:43,501
So you always look forward
to eating the food.

883
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,361
And that, I believe...

884
00:53:47,466 --> 00:53:50,012
Put it in the machine.
Centre it. Turn it around.

885
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:50,974
Hi.

886
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:54,309
I'm your bereavement
liaison, Linda.

887
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:00,332
My consolations for your loss.

888
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:01,669
Thank you.

889
00:54:02,784 --> 00:54:04,944
Okay, these are the forms
you need to fill out.

890
00:54:05,332 --> 00:54:06,639
A death certificate.

891
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:09,369
A report of death.

892
00:54:10,054 --> 00:54:11,574
An M.E. Pink slip.

893
00:54:11,635 --> 00:54:14,082
Please try and be
as detailed as possible.

894
00:54:14,628 --> 00:54:16,875
Um, this is a brochure...

895
00:54:16,936 --> 00:54:19,585
for a grief recovery support
group that meets on Tuesdays.

896
00:54:19,646 --> 00:54:22,338
And, if you like, at this time,
I can refer you to a funeral home...

897
00:54:22,925 --> 00:54:24,613
so you can begin making
your own arrangements.

898
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:28,383
Actually, prearrangements have
already been made in Albuquerque.

899
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:31,803
Albuquerque?

900
00:54:31,864 --> 00:54:33,621
We're actually on our way
to California right now.

901
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:35,522
If the body is
crossing state lines,

902
00:54:35,616 --> 00:54:38,376
you're gonna need a burial transit
permit from a registrar's office.

903
00:54:38,437 --> 00:54:41,957
Okay, but we're trying
to get to Redondo Beach by 3:00.

904
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,405
3:00 today? Hmm.

905
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,240
Ain't gonna happen.

906
00:54:48,644 --> 00:54:50,433
Okay, um, can I just...

907
00:54:50,638 --> 00:54:53,648
I know that this is, uh...
this might be a little unusual...

908
00:54:54,261 --> 00:54:56,790
but if maybe we could just go.

909
00:54:56,851 --> 00:54:58,170
And then we'll come back,

910
00:54:58,231 --> 00:55:00,194
and we'll take care of
all the paperwork and...

911
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:02,602
No. You can't just abandon the body.

912
00:55:02,817 --> 00:55:05,017
No, no, no. Nobody's
gonna abandon the body.

913
00:55:05,078 --> 00:55:05,948
We're gonna go and...

914
00:55:06,009 --> 00:55:07,808
Otherwise, the hospital
becomes responsible.

915
00:55:07,869 --> 00:55:08,839
We're gonna go and come back.

916
00:55:08,933 --> 00:55:10,091
Sir, there are ways
we have of doing things.

917
00:55:10,152 --> 00:55:11,062
You're not following me...

918
00:55:11,123 --> 00:55:12,685
Sir, you are not the only one

919
00:55:12,746 --> 00:55:14,505
that's had somebody
die here today, okay?

920
00:55:22,007 --> 00:55:26,007
Is there any way we might
be able to view the remains?

921
00:55:31,546 --> 00:55:33,823
We haven't had a chance
to move him downstairs...

922
00:55:35,656 --> 00:55:37,244
so someone may come
in in a few minutes

923
00:55:37,305 --> 00:55:38,913
to take him to the basement.

924
00:55:40,223 --> 00:55:41,979
Just tell them who you are,
and they will wait.

925
00:55:42,292 --> 00:55:43,223
-Thank you.
-Okay?

926
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:46,353
And when you're done
with the paperwork,

927
00:55:46,414 --> 00:55:47,741
I'll be at the nurses' station.

928
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:50,363
-Great. Thank you, Linda.
-Thank you.

929
00:56:28,397 --> 00:56:29,551
Goddamn it, Dad.

930
00:56:31,342 --> 00:56:32,557
Goddamn it!

931
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:35,148
Stupid.

932
00:56:45,913 --> 00:56:48,449
We'll go to Little Miss Sunshine
next year, okay, honey?

933
00:56:49,717 --> 00:56:50,825
Next year.

934
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,998
No. No.

935
00:57:02,078 --> 00:57:03,847
We've come 700 miles.

936
00:57:04,136 --> 00:57:07,292
I will be damned if I'm not
making that contest, Sheryl.

937
00:57:07,843 --> 00:57:09,820
Well, Richard,
we can't leave him here.

938
00:57:13,483 --> 00:57:14,870
We're not gonna leave him.

939
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:19,414
-Richard, what are you doing?
-Fuck.

940
00:57:26,331 --> 00:57:28,671
-Dwayne, go around outside.
-Richard, what are you thinking?

941
00:57:28,732 --> 00:57:31,754
-We're gonna take him with us.
-No, no. That is not happening.

942
00:57:31,902 --> 00:57:33,404
He's better off with us
that these people.

943
00:57:33,944 --> 00:57:36,015
I want you to go around outside
and underneath this window.

944
00:57:36,076 --> 00:57:37,350
Dwayne, don't you dare move.

945
00:57:37,461 --> 00:57:40,621
Honey, you stay here.
We'll take Olive. Frank can drive.

946
00:57:40,682 --> 00:57:42,593
No, Sheryl, we'll be
there in two hours.

947
00:57:42,654 --> 00:57:45,369
I'll call a funeral
home once we get there.

948
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,667
If there's one thing
my father would have wanted...

949
00:57:47,941 --> 00:57:50,811
it's to see Olive perform
in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.

950
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:55,285
Now, I believe we'd be doing
a grave disservice to his memory...

951
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:56,843
if we were to just give up now.

952
00:57:57,231 --> 00:58:00,601
All right? There's two kinds
of people in this world.

953
00:58:00,662 --> 00:58:02,761
There's winners
and there's losers.

954
00:58:02,932 --> 00:58:04,532
Okay? You know what
the difference is?

955
00:58:04,811 --> 00:58:05,997
Winners don't give up.

956
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:09,409
So what are we here?
Are we winners, or are we losers?

957
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:11,436
Huh?

958
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:14,969
Okay, okay, okay.
Let's do it.

959
00:58:15,724 --> 00:58:17,584
You guys go. Olive,
you watch the curtain.

960
00:58:23,790 --> 00:58:26,835
I don't know. I have no reason
to assume it's gonna be otherwise.

961
00:58:28,053 --> 00:58:30,073
Watch. Get the back.
Get the back.

962
00:58:30,134 --> 00:58:31,727
Shh. Go, go, go.

963
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:35,634
Yeah, 1:00.

964
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,044
Now?

965
00:58:40,714 --> 00:58:43,281
-He's very heavy. Be gentle.
-Mm-hmm.

966
00:58:43,348 --> 00:58:44,097
Now!

967
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:46,937
One, two...

968
00:58:47,839 --> 00:58:50,910
Okay, three.
Wait, wait, wait!

969
00:58:50,971 --> 00:58:52,021
Not yet. Not yet.

970
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:56,637
-Okay, go. Go, go, go.
-Shh, shh, shh. Okay.

971
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,587
Richard, I can't do it!

972
00:58:59,648 --> 00:59:00,719
-I got him. I got him.
-Come on.

973
00:59:02,069 --> 00:59:03,762
Come on!
Hurry up!

974
00:59:09,147 --> 00:59:10,570
Okay, he's slipping.
Okay.

975
00:59:11,005 --> 00:59:11,988
Hold on.

976
00:59:16,266 --> 00:59:18,029
I got it. I got it.
I got it. I got it.

977
00:59:21,075 --> 00:59:22,153
Be careful.

978
00:59:26,485 --> 00:59:27,521
Be cool. Be cool.

979
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:28,776
Okay. Here we go.

980
00:59:28,837 --> 00:59:29,712
Hurry up.

981
00:59:31,404 --> 00:59:32,259
Keep watch, Olive.

982
00:59:34,318 --> 00:59:35,351
Watch the curb.
Watch the curb.

983
00:59:43,468 --> 00:59:44,469
Watch his head!
Watch it!

984
00:59:46,498 --> 00:59:47,322
Keys.

985
00:59:51,836 --> 00:59:53,236
Swing him around this way.

986
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:55,386
-Olive, get in.
-Here we go.

987
00:59:57,016 --> 00:59:58,097
Okay, let's go.

988
01:00:02,117 --> 01:00:04,714
Sheryl. Let's go, Frank.

989
01:00:04,915 --> 01:00:08,505
Did I mention that I am the
pre-eminent Proust scholar in the U.S?

990
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:12,373
Here we go! Here we go!

991
01:00:12,683 --> 01:00:13,860
Are you okay?

992
01:00:22,865 --> 01:00:24,987
-Dad?
-Yeah, honey?

993
01:00:29,173 --> 01:00:30,530
What's gonna happen to Grandpa?

994
01:00:53,018 --> 01:00:54,079
Uncle Frank?

995
01:00:55,387 --> 01:00:56,144
Yeah?

996
01:00:59,185 --> 01:01:00,636
Do you think there's a heaven?

997
01:01:03,594 --> 01:01:06,731
That's hard to say, Olive.
I... I don't think anyone knows for sure.

998
01:01:08,212 --> 01:01:10,920
I know, but what do you think?

999
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:13,727
Um,

1000
01:01:14,983 --> 01:01:15,654
well...

1001
01:01:15,863 --> 01:01:17,195
I think there is one.

1002
01:01:19,663 --> 01:01:21,744
-You think I'll get in?
-Yes.

1003
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,157
-Promise?
-Yes.

1004
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:41,093
Whoa! Hey! Son of a bitch!

1005
01:01:41,154 --> 01:01:43,177
-What happened?
-He... He cut me off.

1006
01:01:48,176 --> 01:01:50,367
-It's stuck.
-Okay, just leave it.

1007
01:01:50,566 --> 01:01:51,523
It's stuck or something.

1008
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,842
-Maybe... try pulling it from under here.
-No, no. Just leave it.

1009
01:01:58,132 --> 01:02:00,211
-Fix it when we get there.
-Okay, fine.

1010
01:02:01,255 --> 01:02:01,857
Shit!

1011
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,161
Oh, Jesus! God!

1012
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:11,062
I'm being pulled over.

1013
01:02:12,024 --> 01:02:12,888
Here we go.

1014
01:02:14,454 --> 01:02:15,407
Okay.

1015
01:02:15,876 --> 01:02:18,677
Everybody just pretend
to be normal, okay?

1016
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,167
Like-Like everything's normal here.

1017
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:36,367
How you folks doin'?

1018
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:39,040
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're fine.
Just...

1019
01:02:40,918 --> 01:02:43,174
-Little trouble with the horn?
-Sorry. What?

1020
01:02:43,235 --> 01:02:45,705
-Havin' a little trouble with your horn?
-Yeah.

1021
01:02:47,731 --> 01:02:49,194
Little trouble. Sorry.

1022
01:02:49,255 --> 01:02:51,121
Uh, sorry.

1023
01:02:52,264 --> 01:02:53,334
Could you step outside
the vehicle?

1024
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:04,198
Step this way, please.

1025
01:03:05,008 --> 01:03:05,794
No, no.

1026
01:03:05,855 --> 01:03:06,367
What?

1027
01:03:07,152 --> 01:03:07,845
Don't...

1028
01:03:08,401 --> 01:03:08,979
'Don't' what?

1029
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,471
Do you have something
in your trunk, sir?

1030
01:03:14,767 --> 01:03:15,359
It's nothing. I...

1031
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:17,073
Don't... don't open it.

1032
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:20,233
You've just given me probable
cause to search your trunk.

1033
01:03:20,294 --> 01:03:21,289
Just... I... I just...

1034
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,438
Put your hands on the vehicle now!
Now!

1035
01:03:24,923 --> 01:03:25,614
-Don't move.
-Okay.

1036
01:03:29,892 --> 01:03:30,926
It's not illegal!

1037
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:33,553
Sir, I would advise you
to keep your mouth shut!

1038
01:03:35,293 --> 01:03:37,684
Oh, my God.
What is he doing?

1039
01:03:44,359 --> 01:03:47,036
-It's not illegal.
-Goddamn.

1040
01:03:53,172 --> 01:03:54,178
Sir, could you come back here?

1041
01:04:04,545 --> 01:04:06,735
I love this stuff. I love it.

1042
01:04:07,071 --> 01:04:08,700
God bless ya.
God bless ya.

1043
01:04:10,149 --> 01:04:11,562
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna bust ya.

1044
01:04:12,078 --> 01:04:13,076
Oh, thank you.

1045
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:16,234
How you doin'?

1046
01:04:19,448 --> 01:04:21,866
-Cute... cute family. That's nice.
-Thank you.

1047
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:24,712
This on the side. A little
of this, a little of that.

1048
01:04:24,773 --> 01:04:25,526
-It's-

1049
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:27,939
-Oh, man.
-Sweet... sweetness.

1050
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,048
That is sweet. Yeah.

1051
01:04:30,109 --> 01:04:32,749
-Dirty.
-And this one is one of my favourites.

1052
01:04:33,911 --> 01:04:35,418
Ahh, good, yeah.

1053
01:04:37,634 --> 01:04:39,828
That's a little different choice.

1054
01:04:43,396 --> 01:04:43,988
No?

1055
01:04:46,927 --> 01:04:48,983
-Gonna leave that with ya.
-All right.

1056
01:04:49,827 --> 01:04:51,810
-You have a good day there.
-Yeah.

1057
01:05:03,473 --> 01:05:04,446
What happened?

1058
01:05:06,189 --> 01:05:08,114
I'll tell you when I
regain consciousness.

1059
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:14,896
Frank, Dwayne, get out and push.

1060
01:05:32,856 --> 01:05:35,439
Okay, there it is...
Redondo Beach, 46.

1061
01:05:36,102 --> 01:05:38,104
It's 2:15. Might be
a few minutes late.

1062
01:05:38,165 --> 01:05:41,003
Now, Richard, they said 3:00 sharp.
They were very explicit.

1063
01:05:41,064 --> 01:05:42,766
We can't cross these people.
Trust me.

1064
01:05:42,827 --> 01:05:46,200
-Mom, Dwayne has 20/20 vision.
-I bet he does.

1065
01:05:46,897 --> 01:05:49,425
Okay, now I'm gonna check
to see if you're colour blind.

1066
01:05:49,914 --> 01:05:51,207
Ass hole!

1067
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:55,043
What's the letter in the circle?

1068
01:05:58,377 --> 01:06:00,798
No, no, no.
Inside the circle.

1069
01:06:01,422 --> 01:06:03,542
Right there. See?

1070
01:06:04,397 --> 01:06:07,303
It's an 'A.' Can't you see it?
Right there.

1071
01:06:10,327 --> 01:06:11,529
It's bright green.

1072
01:06:15,987 --> 01:06:17,103
Oh, man.

1073
01:06:26,451 --> 01:06:28,400
Dwayne, I think you
might be colour blind.

1074
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,316
You can't fly jets
if you're colour blind.

1075
01:06:54,713 --> 01:06:56,107
We've got a little bit of...

1076
01:06:56,807 --> 01:06:58,558
Okay, got an
emergency back here.

1077
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:00,850
-I think we need to pull over.
-What is it?

1078
01:07:00,911 --> 01:07:02,500
-What's the emergency?
-Pull over.

1079
01:07:03,098 --> 01:07:06,433
It's all right, man. Dwayne, Dwayne!
It's all right. Hold on.

1080
01:07:06,494 --> 01:07:08,859
-Just pull over the car!
-Okay! All right!

1081
01:07:09,983 --> 01:07:12,540
-Could you get him to pull over, please?
-Richard, pull over!

1082
01:07:12,601 --> 01:07:15,301
-Richard, pull over the car!
-It's all right. We're pulling over.

1083
01:07:15,362 --> 01:07:17,502
-I'm pulling over. Stop it.
-It's all right.

1084
01:07:17,563 --> 01:07:21,528
-Dwayne! No, no. Dwayne. Sit down.
-God, this better be good.

1085
01:07:21,589 --> 01:07:24,340
-Pull over.
-I'm pulling over. All right.

1086
01:07:24,755 --> 01:07:26,634
Stop the car. It's
gonna be okay, Dwayne.

1087
01:07:26,695 --> 01:07:28,195
All right. Don't open the door.

1088
01:07:28,256 --> 01:07:30,155
Dwayne? Oh, God!

1089
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,430
Fuck!

1090
01:07:37,435 --> 01:07:39,302
Fuck!

1091
01:07:41,134 --> 01:07:43,761
-What happened?
-He's colour blind. He can't fly.

1092
01:07:44,961 --> 01:07:46,294
Oh, Jesus.

1093
01:07:48,382 --> 01:07:49,447
Oh, no.

1094
01:07:52,054 --> 01:07:52,511
Uh, just-

1095
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:53,947
just give him a second.

1096
01:08:17,043 --> 01:08:17,902
Dwayne?

1097
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:23,819
Dwayne, honey, I'm sorry.

1098
01:08:31,022 --> 01:08:33,725
-Dwayne, come on. We have to go.
-I'm not going.

1099
01:08:37,442 --> 01:08:39,615
-Dwayne...
-I said I'm not.

1100
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:42,863
Okay? I don't care.
I'm not getting on that bus again.

1101
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:46,779
Dwayne, for better or worse,
we're your family.

1102
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,314
No, you're not my family!

1103
01:08:48,837 --> 01:08:50,700
Okay? I don't wanna
be your family!

1104
01:08:50,899 --> 01:08:54,236
I hate you fucking people!
I hate you!

1105
01:08:55,155 --> 01:08:58,369
Divorce, bankrupt, suicide!

1106
01:08:58,978 --> 01:09:01,589
You fucking losers!
You're losers!

1107
01:09:05,067 --> 01:09:07,833
No. Please
just leave me here, Mom.

1108
01:09:08,164 --> 01:09:09,614
Okay?
Please, please, please.

1109
01:09:13,871 --> 01:09:15,045
Please just leave me here.

1110
01:09:27,043 --> 01:09:27,705
Shit.

1111
01:09:31,926 --> 01:09:33,239
I don't know what to do.

1112
01:09:34,813 --> 01:09:37,313
Well, it's gettin' late.

1113
01:09:37,374 --> 01:09:39,889
Maybe... can somebody
stay here with him?

1114
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:42,371
-I'll stay.
-Oh, that is not happening.

1115
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:47,175
All right. Well...

1116
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:49,199
uh...

1117
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:52,726
I'm just worried about the time.

1118
01:09:56,549 --> 01:09:57,190
Olive,

1119
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,010
you, uh...

1120
01:10:00,093 --> 01:10:01,279
you wanna try talking to him?

1121
01:10:01,340 --> 01:10:04,089
Richard, no! There is nothing to say.
We just have to wait.

1122
01:10:04,870 --> 01:10:05,396
Honey...

1123
01:10:56,623 --> 01:10:57,264
Okay.

1124
01:11:00,237 --> 01:11:01,071
Let's go.

1125
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:35,257
I apologize for the things I said.

1126
01:11:37,176 --> 01:11:37,984
I was upset.

1127
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:40,200
I didn't really mean them.

1128
01:11:43,196 --> 01:11:44,037
It's okay. Come on.

1129
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:45,543
Let's go.

1130
01:11:52,066 --> 01:11:52,729
2:55.

1131
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,641
All right. Everybody,
look for the exit, okay?

1132
01:11:58,835 --> 01:12:00,830
Okay, here! Here's the turn-off.
Turn in here.

1133
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:03,313
Does anybody see
the Redondo Suites?

1134
01:12:03,977 --> 01:12:07,284
-There's the hotel!
-There it is! There it is, Olive.

1135
01:12:07,345 --> 01:12:09,692
We're gonna make it.
We're gonna make it.

1136
01:12:10,296 --> 01:12:10,813
All right.

1137
01:12:11,167 --> 01:12:11,990
How...

1138
01:12:13,303 --> 01:12:14,632
How the hell do
you get over there?

1139
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:18,075
-Sheryl?
-No, no, no, no!

1140
01:12:18,642 --> 01:12:22,228
-You're passing it!
-Turn around, turn around.

1141
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:24,889
-You drove past it!
-You've gotta turn around!

1142
01:12:24,950 --> 01:12:26,906
-It's back there!
-I can't turn around.

1143
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:29,403
Anybody see a way back?
It's a one-way street!

1144
01:12:29,464 --> 01:12:30,153
Oh!

1145
01:12:30,959 --> 01:12:33,451
Rich! You've got parking
lots on the right!

1146
01:12:34,646 --> 01:12:36,843
-Here, here!
-Put your seat belt on, baby!

1147
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:39,358
-What are you doing?
-I can't slow down! I can't!

1148
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:43,295
-What time is it, Frank?
-Oh, 2:59.

1149
01:12:43,356 --> 01:12:43,858
Dad!

1150
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:45,442
Straight shot from here.
We're gonna make it.

1151
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,307
-Oh, it's a dead end!
-I'm not goin' back!

1152
01:12:49,368 --> 01:12:51,818
-Richard, you have to go back!
-That is a one-way road!

1153
01:12:51,879 --> 01:12:54,297
That'll take us all the way
back to the free-way!

1154
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:57,449
You're the one who told me
to go left back there!

1155
01:12:58,679 --> 01:12:59,894
I'm not turnin' back.

1156
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:03,977
-Richard!
-It's right there.

1157
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:08,789
What-What are you doing?
You can't do this!

1158
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:11,745
-God, Richard!
-Okay, here's the hotel.

1159
01:13:11,813 --> 01:13:13,473
Okay, stop!

1160
01:13:13,729 --> 01:13:15,357
-Where's the entrance?
-Right here!

1161
01:13:16,206 --> 01:13:18,409
You passed it!
You're passing it!

1162
01:13:18,470 --> 01:13:20,019
Hold on!

1163
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:24,183
Here we go. One more time.
Little bump.

1164
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:31,205
Mom!

1165
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:15,346
Hello?
Hi. We'd like to register.

1166
01:14:15,407 --> 01:14:16,701
Sorry, we're closed.

1167
01:14:16,762 --> 01:14:19,242
Uh, no. We have the
entrant right here.

1168
01:14:19,377 --> 01:14:22,519
-We just wanna check in.
-Registration ended at 3:00.

1169
01:14:22,774 --> 01:14:25,158
-It's 3:00 now.
-No.

1170
01:14:25,743 --> 01:14:27,783
Oh. Come on. Have a heart.
We're four minutes late.

1171
01:14:27,844 --> 01:14:29,504
We just drove all the
way from Albuquerque.

1172
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,906
-Then you should've been here by 3:00.
-Wait, wait.

1173
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,657
There must be some way
we can work this out. Please.

1174
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:36,795
Everybody else was
here before 3:00.

1175
01:14:36,856 --> 01:14:38,498
I'd be giving unfair advantage.

1176
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:39,853
No, we're not looking
for an advantage.

1177
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:41,641
We just want her to compete.
That's it.

1178
01:14:41,729 --> 01:14:44,219
Don't yell at me, sir.
I didn't make you late.

1179
01:14:44,681 --> 01:14:46,417
We've settled on the
schedule for the show.

1180
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:47,429
We've turned off the computers.

1181
01:14:47,490 --> 01:14:50,325
Our line-up is final.
I have a hair check to do.

1182
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:50,801
Okay.

1183
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:53,130
I'm sorry that you're late,
but I can't help you.

1184
01:14:56,653 --> 01:14:57,234
Please.

1185
01:14:58,939 --> 01:15:00,324
You don't know
what we've been through.

1186
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,115
Um, Miss Jenkins?

1187
01:15:07,659 --> 01:15:09,417
I... I can put
'em in the system.

1188
01:15:10,258 --> 01:15:13,891
-Oh, Kirby, you don't have to.
-No, it's okay. Takes five minutes.

1189
01:15:14,778 --> 01:15:17,526
Well, it's your time.
Excuse me.

1190
01:15:18,495 --> 01:15:20,551
Thank you, Kirby.
Thank you very much.

1191
01:15:20,697 --> 01:15:22,045
Really, you don't know
what this means.

1192
01:15:22,145 --> 01:15:24,135
Please, it's only five minutes.

1193
01:15:24,831 --> 01:15:26,781
I am not working for
these people next year.

1194
01:15:27,188 --> 01:15:28,227
These people are crazy.

1195
01:15:29,155 --> 01:15:31,285
Okay, so, what's your name?

1196
01:15:31,841 --> 01:15:32,486
Olive.

1197
01:15:33,602 --> 01:15:34,482
That's a nice name.

1198
01:15:34,556 --> 01:15:36,662
-Mom, Mom! Look!
-What's her last name?

1199
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:39,249
It's Miss California.
Look, it's really her!

1200
01:15:39,423 --> 01:15:40,472
You want to go say hi?

1201
01:15:40,533 --> 01:15:41,527
Albuquerque...

1202
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:47,861
-Thank you.
-Bonnie, come here. Come on.

1203
01:15:47,922 --> 01:15:49,877
Hi! What's your name?

1204
01:15:50,097 --> 01:15:50,868
Olive.

1205
01:15:51,207 --> 01:15:52,647
What's your talent, Olive?

1206
01:15:53,143 --> 01:15:54,473
I like dancing.

1207
01:15:54,944 --> 01:15:57,403
Dancing was too hard for me.
I'm a singer.

1208
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,150
You must be a good dancer.

1209
01:15:59,773 --> 01:16:00,522
I am.

1210
01:16:00,838 --> 01:16:01,863
I'm really good.

1211
01:16:01,934 --> 01:16:03,304
I bet you are.

1212
01:16:03,950 --> 01:16:05,992
Well, thanks for
stopping by, Olive.

1213
01:16:06,323 --> 01:16:07,170
Best of luck.

1214
01:16:11,161 --> 01:16:12,181
Hmm. Miss California?

1215
01:16:13,072 --> 01:16:14,257
Do you eat ice cream?

1216
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:15,858
I love ice cream.

1217
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:18,931
My favourite flavour is
Chocolate Cherry Garcia...

1218
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:21,887
although, technically,
I think that's a frozen yogurt.

1219
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:23,501
Okay?

1220
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:26,395
Okay. Thanks. Bye.

1221
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:27,169
Bye.

1222
01:16:29,570 --> 01:16:32,706
-Mom, she eats ice cream.
-I heard.

1223
01:16:34,671 --> 01:16:38,259
Your packet has tickets in it,
and there's your badge number.

1224
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:39,505
-Okay.
-Is there anything else?

1225
01:16:40,245 --> 01:16:42,734
Uh, yeah. Is there a
funeral home around here?

1226
01:16:57,621 --> 01:16:58,774
-Hi.
-Hi.

1227
01:17:03,311 --> 01:17:05,471
Okay, Olive,
let's get your swimsuit on.

1228
01:17:05,581 --> 01:17:06,833
You wanna go change
behind the curtain?

1229
01:17:07,311 --> 01:17:09,108
This is the last
touch-up, everybody.

1230
01:17:09,169 --> 01:17:10,996
Final touch-ups. Last touch-up.

1231
01:17:42,352 --> 01:17:45,005
-Okay! Wait!
-I won't wait for you!

1232
01:17:47,453 --> 01:17:48,465
Let's get outta here.

1233
01:17:53,396 --> 01:17:55,585
Hey! Hey, Olive Hoover.

1234
01:17:56,043 --> 01:17:58,303
-Mm-hmm?
-Hey, I need your music.

1235
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:00,485
-Oh, music, right.
-Yeah.

1236
01:18:04,312 --> 01:18:05,457
Where is it? All right.

1237
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:09,611
Here you go.

1238
01:18:10,826 --> 01:18:11,453
This?

1239
01:18:12,176 --> 01:18:14,340
-Did you choose this?
-No, my grandpa did.

1240
01:18:14,805 --> 01:18:16,113
-Your grandpa?
-Mm-hmm.

1241
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:17,951
-Which track?
-Twelve.

1242
01:18:19,218 --> 01:18:20,994
We were drivin' five, six hours.

1243
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:22,554
Thought he was napping.

1244
01:18:23,419 --> 01:18:25,152
By the time we figured it out, it's...

1245
01:18:26,981 --> 01:18:27,607
You know.

1246
01:18:28,085 --> 01:18:28,712
Too late.

1247
01:18:30,862 --> 01:18:31,703
So where's the body?

1248
01:18:33,491 --> 01:18:34,002
Um...

1249
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:51,539
Personal effects.

1250
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:53,921
-Thank you.
-You take care.

1251
01:18:56,268 --> 01:18:57,075
You too.

1252
01:19:20,916 --> 01:19:21,923
I'm ready.

1253
01:19:22,637 --> 01:19:23,839
I'm ready.

1254
01:19:27,229 --> 01:19:29,682
-She was scared, but she did very well.
-Was she?

1255
01:19:34,536 --> 01:19:35,922
Ladies and gentlemen,

1256
01:19:36,598 --> 01:19:39,056
welcome to the 24th annual...

1257
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:41,354
Little Miss Sunshine Pageant!

1258
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:44,884
Yes!

1259
01:19:46,146 --> 01:19:48,618
Now, please, put your
hands together once again

1260
01:19:48,828 --> 01:19:50,485
and help me welcome
to the stage...

1261
01:19:50,609 --> 01:19:53,749
our 12 beautiful contestants!

1262
01:20:14,375 --> 01:20:14,938
Wow.

1263
01:21:15,323 --> 01:21:17,993
Oh, let's have a big
round of applause

1264
01:21:18,054 --> 01:21:20,556
for our lovely contestants!

1265
01:21:22,183 --> 01:21:25,215
At the end of the evening,
one of these girls...

1266
01:21:25,276 --> 01:21:28,716
will be crowned
Little Miss Sunshine!

1267
01:21:37,489 --> 01:21:39,319
Olive, honey,
are you okay in there?

1268
01:21:40,142 --> 01:21:41,338
Yeah, I'm fine.

1269
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:46,343
Hey.

1270
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:49,358
What?

1271
01:21:49,851 --> 01:21:51,652
You got a kid in the show?

1272
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:53,991
Your first time?

1273
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:57,171
Yeah, yeah.

1274
01:22:45,882 --> 01:22:47,161
America!

1275
01:22:48,490 --> 01:22:50,120
It's so beautiful!

1276
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:54,582
Sometimes...

1277
01:22:54,986 --> 01:22:57,425
I just wish I could go
to sleep till I was 18...

1278
01:22:58,929 --> 01:23:00,883
and skip all this
crap-high school

1279
01:23:00,944 --> 01:23:02,737
and everything-just skip it.

1280
01:23:05,228 --> 01:23:06,849
You know Marcel Proust?

1281
01:23:07,898 --> 01:23:09,830
-He's the guy you teach.
-Yeah.

1282
01:23:10,328 --> 01:23:11,287
French writer.

1283
01:23:11,771 --> 01:23:13,715
Total loser.

1284
01:23:14,581 --> 01:23:15,768
Never had a real job.

1285
01:23:16,242 --> 01:23:18,569
Unrequited love affairs. Gay.

1286
01:23:19,581 --> 01:23:22,511
Spent 20 years writing a book
almost no one reads.

1287
01:23:22,585 --> 01:23:24,935
But he's also probably
the greatest writer since Shakespeare.

1288
01:23:24,996 --> 01:23:26,031
Anyway, he, uh...

1289
01:23:27,213 --> 01:23:28,611
he gets down to the
end of his life...

1290
01:23:29,417 --> 01:23:32,477
and he looks back and decides
that all those years he suffered...

1291
01:23:32,538 --> 01:23:34,455
Those were the best
years of his life,

1292
01:23:34,759 --> 01:23:35,953
'cause they made him who he was.

1293
01:23:36,851 --> 01:23:38,752
All the years he was happy?
You know, total waste.

1294
01:23:39,512 --> 01:23:40,246
Didn't learn a thing.

1295
01:23:41,977 --> 01:23:44,792
So, if you sleep
until you're 18...

1296
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:48,598
ah, think of the suffering
you're gonna miss.

1297
01:23:48,659 --> 01:23:50,280
I mean, high school?
High school...

1298
01:23:50,341 --> 01:23:51,793
Those are your prime
suffering years.

1299
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:53,832
You don't get better suffering
than that.

1300
01:23:58,876 --> 01:23:59,718
You know what?

1301
01:24:02,674 --> 01:24:04,134
Fuck beauty contests.

1302
01:24:05,842 --> 01:24:09,142
Life is one fucking
beauty contest after another.

1303
01:24:09,717 --> 01:24:12,836
You know, school,
then college, then work?

1304
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:13,995
Fuck that.

1305
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:17,234
And fuck the Air Force Academy.

1306
01:24:17,816 --> 01:24:20,234
If I wanna fly,
I'll find a way to fly.

1307
01:24:21,071 --> 01:24:22,383
You do what you love,

1308
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:24,003
and fuck the rest.

1309
01:24:30,399 --> 01:24:31,929
I'm glad you're
talkin' again, Dwayne.

1310
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,449
You're not nearly as
stupid as you look.

1311
01:24:45,322 --> 01:24:46,122
Wanna go back?

1312
01:24:47,418 --> 01:24:48,440
Not really.

1313
01:24:51,745 --> 01:24:53,414
Yeah, we should go back.

1314
01:24:56,364 --> 01:24:59,330
And now, the moment
we've all been waiting for...

1315
01:25:00,265 --> 01:25:02,326
the talent competition.

1316
01:25:13,378 --> 01:25:15,259
Miss Carly Nugent.

1317
01:25:44,742 --> 01:25:46,694
Yee-haw!

1318
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:49,721
Yodel-lay-he-hoo, that was great!

1319
01:26:07,622 --> 01:26:09,143
Wow-ow-ow-ow!

1320
01:26:09,249 --> 01:26:11,719
Funky-licious!

1321
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,370
I'm goin' backstage.

1322
01:26:35,431 --> 01:26:36,977
Yeah, right. See ya.

1323
01:26:40,888 --> 01:26:42,157
Oh, look at you.

1324
01:26:43,298 --> 01:26:44,090
Is that your costume?

1325
01:26:44,151 --> 01:26:44,891
Mm-hmm.

1326
01:26:47,094 --> 01:26:49,084
Okay, here.

1327
01:26:51,627 --> 01:26:52,592
Hey, what's goin' on?

1328
01:26:53,001 --> 01:26:55,417
Oh, I just-I came to
wish Olive good luck.

1329
01:26:55,478 --> 01:26:56,381
How you doin', honey?

1330
01:26:56,579 --> 01:26:57,194
Good.

1331
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:00,262
-Nervous.
-Yeah. You're gonna do great.

1332
01:27:00,461 --> 01:27:01,613
I just know it.

1333
01:27:01,674 --> 01:27:03,346
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah.

1334
01:27:05,848 --> 01:27:06,711
What's up?

1335
01:27:10,613 --> 01:27:11,855
I don't want her to go on.

1336
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:18,250
-Are you authorized to be backstage?
-No. Hey.

1337
01:27:18,336 --> 01:27:20,692
-Where are the dressing rooms?
-Are you allowed to be here?

1338
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:22,631
Just tell me where
the dressing rooms are.

1339
01:27:23,217 --> 01:27:26,281
Listen, we're not in Albuquerque anymore.

1340
01:27:27,286 --> 01:27:29,529
-Hey, how are you feeling?
-Better. Where's Olive?

1341
01:27:29,776 --> 01:27:32,625
-There. What's up?
-Mom, I don't want Olive doing this.

1342
01:27:32,929 --> 01:27:34,248
Oh, my God!

1343
01:27:34,309 --> 01:27:37,188
-Look around. This place is fucked!
-He's right!

1344
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:40,518
Look, I don't want these
people judging Olive. Fuck them!

1345
01:27:40,599 --> 01:27:43,947
-Listen, it is too late.
-No, it's not too late. You're the mom...

1346
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:45,522
and you're supposed to protect her.

1347
01:27:46,265 --> 01:27:48,618
Everyone is gonna
laugh at her, Mom.

1348
01:27:49,592 --> 01:27:51,481
Please don't let her do this.

1349
01:27:51,732 --> 01:27:53,206
Olive Hoover, two minutes.

1350
01:27:54,775 --> 01:27:56,215
Look, she's not a beauty queen.

1351
01:27:57,618 --> 01:27:58,650
She's just not.

1352
01:28:00,063 --> 01:28:00,912
I'm gonna tell her.

1353
01:28:00,973 --> 01:28:01,892
No, Dwayne. You listen to me.

1354
01:28:02,303 --> 01:28:03,633
Olive is who she is.

1355
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:06,597
She has worked so hard.
She's poured everything into this.

1356
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:08,249
We can't just take
it away from her.

1357
01:28:08,717 --> 01:28:09,713
We can't.

1358
01:28:10,590 --> 01:28:13,181
I know you wanna protect her.
I know, honey, but...

1359
01:28:13,816 --> 01:28:15,596
we gotta let Olive be Olive.

1360
01:28:17,236 --> 01:28:18,916
Olive Hoover. Are you the family?

1361
01:28:18,977 --> 01:28:20,746
Yeah. Okay?

1362
01:28:22,478 --> 01:28:24,647
Olive, it's time. Okay?

1363
01:28:25,851 --> 01:28:26,350
Yeah.

1364
01:28:27,481 --> 01:28:29,103
-We gotta go now.
-Hang on.

1365
01:28:30,797 --> 01:28:31,766
Olive, look at me.

1366
01:28:33,908 --> 01:28:36,053
If you don't want to do this,
that's okay.

1367
01:28:37,006 --> 01:28:38,337
If you want to sit this one out,

1368
01:28:39,138 --> 01:28:41,317
it's totally fine by us.
We're proud of you anyway.

1369
01:28:42,583 --> 01:28:43,359
We gotta go.

1370
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,627
It's time.

1371
01:28:58,377 --> 01:28:59,659
Ready? Let's go.

1372
01:29:11,905 --> 01:29:12,893
Good luck, honey.

1373
01:29:14,439 --> 01:29:16,999
Copy that. Twenty-five
is performance ready...

1374
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:17,818
and we're walkin'...

1375
01:29:20,119 --> 01:29:21,269
as fast as we can.

1376
01:29:24,607 --> 01:29:26,875
-Is she going on?
-Yeah. She's going on.

1377
01:29:30,863 --> 01:29:32,710
Pure fairy-tale magic.

1378
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:34,732
Miss Charisma Whiteman!

1379
01:29:36,235 --> 01:29:38,308
Wasn't that a stardust fantasy?

1380
01:29:38,369 --> 01:29:39,459
Thank you for that.

1381
01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:41,825
You have been such
a patient audience.

1382
01:29:42,094 --> 01:29:43,425
We have one more contestant,

1383
01:29:43,486 --> 01:29:45,225
and then we'll be
crowning our winner.

1384
01:29:45,435 --> 01:29:48,675
Please give a warm welcome to...
Miss...

1385
01:29:50,253 --> 01:29:51,952
Olive Hoover!

1386
01:30:06,514 --> 01:30:07,256
You okay?

1387
01:30:08,451 --> 01:30:12,450
Um, I'd like to dedicate this
to my grandpa...

1388
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:15,050
who showed me these moves.

1389
01:30:15,594 --> 01:30:17,354
Oh, that is so sweet!

1390
01:30:18,823 --> 01:30:20,649
Is he here? Where is
your grandpa right now?

1391
01:30:21,547 --> 01:30:23,131
In the trunk of our car.

1392
01:30:24,654 --> 01:30:25,769
Okay!

1393
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:27,833
Well, take it away, Olive!

1394
01:30:44,879 --> 01:30:45,572
Huh!

1395
01:31:21,892 --> 01:31:23,406
You suck!

1396
01:31:24,655 --> 01:31:26,775
Those little fuckers. I will kill them.

1397
01:31:26,843 --> 01:31:28,489
You stink!

1398
01:31:37,691 --> 01:31:39,408
No, no, no, no, no.

1399
01:32:10,710 --> 01:32:12,543
What is your daughter doing?

1400
01:32:20,450 --> 01:32:23,091
She's kickin' ass.
That's what she's doin'.

1401
01:32:38,222 --> 01:32:40,500
Get over here!
Get over here!

1402
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:42,450
I want that little ragamuffin
off the stage this minute.

1403
01:32:42,537 --> 01:32:43,166
All right.

1404
01:32:43,400 --> 01:32:45,327
Get her. Right now!
Right this minute!

1405
01:32:45,388 --> 01:32:46,820
Don't touch... don't touch her.

1406
01:32:46,881 --> 01:32:49,556
-Your act's over, honey.
-Hey!

1407
01:32:52,442 --> 01:32:55,264
-Hey! Hey, let go of my daughter!
-Oh!

1408
01:32:56,118 --> 01:32:58,179
Holy sh...

1409
01:32:59,357 --> 01:33:00,791
Let her finish!

1410
01:33:04,164 --> 01:33:07,175
Get off me!
Help! Get off me!

1411
01:33:07,969 --> 01:33:09,754
-Help me!
-Take charge! Just take charge!

1412
01:33:09,815 --> 01:33:11,188
Keep dancin', honey!
Daddy's okay.

1413
01:33:13,352 --> 01:33:17,153
Get your daughter
off this stage right now!

1414
01:33:18,214 --> 01:33:19,821
Now!

1415
01:33:24,713 --> 01:33:25,458
Honey?

1416
01:33:44,111 --> 01:33:46,249
-Like that?
-Oh!

1417
01:34:38,198 --> 01:34:39,459
-Ooh!
-Ah!

1418
01:34:50,581 --> 01:34:53,843
Yeah! All right!

1419
01:35:09,666 --> 01:35:11,438
Okay, you're out...

1420
01:35:12,139 --> 01:35:14,069
on the condition
that you never enter

1421
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:15,664
your daughter in a
beauty pageant...

1422
01:35:15,725 --> 01:35:17,610
in the state of California ever again.

1423
01:35:18,366 --> 01:35:18,992
Ever.

1424
01:35:22,469 --> 01:35:24,157
I think we can live with that.

1425
01:35:29,212 --> 01:35:29,944
All right.

1426
01:35:31,318 --> 01:35:32,205
We're back in business.

1427
01:35:32,869 --> 01:35:33,670
Lock and load.

1428
01:35:48,494 --> 01:35:51,824
Olive, your grandpa would've
been really proud of you.

1429
01:35:51,885 --> 01:35:54,497
-Yeah, you were great. Mm-wah!
-You were beyond great.

1430
01:35:55,022 --> 01:35:56,071
You were incredible.

1431
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:57,984
Thank you.

1432
01:36:02,109 --> 01:36:03,229
Let's get outta here.

1433
01:36:29,033 --> 01:36:29,764
Whoo!

1434
01:36:32,864 --> 01:36:33,942
It's in gear.

1435
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:47,864
What in the world?
