1
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:09,333
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Williams.

2
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,333
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning.

3
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:14,834
- Morning, Mrs. Wilberforce.
- Good morning, Mr. Brown.

4
00:02:14,834 --> 00:02:17,834
- Morning, madam.
- Good morning.

5
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:24,295
Fetch the superintendent.
Tell him it's Mrs. Wilberforce.

6
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,836
[Baby screaming]

7
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:39,088
- Good morning, ma'am.
- Good morning, sergeant.

8
00:02:39,547 --> 00:02:41,588
Ah, good morning, Mrs. Wilberforce.

9
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:45,589
Very nice to see you again.
Good morning, superintendent.

10
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:50,590
It's about my friend
Amelia and the spaceship...

11
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,591
- Spaceship? - That she saw in her
garden last Wednesday afternoon.

12
00:02:55,591 --> 00:02:58,591
She hasn't seen it again?

13
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:01,091
She never saw it in the first place.

14
00:03:01,591 --> 00:03:03,591
Oh, I'm very relieved to hear that.

15
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:08,592
On Wednesday in children's hour, they
were doing a little play called...

16
00:03:08,592 --> 00:03:11,592
visitors from other worlds.

17
00:03:12,092 --> 00:03:14,093
Amelia had her wireless on.

18
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:18,094
It's obvious. She dropped off to sleep.

19
00:03:18,594 --> 00:03:21,094
The whole thing was just a dream.

20
00:03:21,594 --> 00:03:23,594
Amelia was so embarrassed.

21
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:26,596
She quite refused to come
here to tell you herself.

22
00:03:26,596 --> 00:03:30,096
Well. I do hope all sorts
of official wheels...

23
00:03:30,096 --> 00:03:33,596
haven't been set in motion. Now,
you mustn't worry about that, ma'am.

24
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,096
I'm very grateful to you for
this additional information.

25
00:03:36,096 --> 00:03:38,097
Now, if you'll allow me,
I'll see you to the door.

26
00:03:38,097 --> 00:03:41,098
But as I was with her
when she came to report it,

27
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,098
I thought it no more than my
duty to come here and explain.

28
00:03:45,098 --> 00:03:49,099
I must say, if there are
any beings on other worlds,

29
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,099
I can't think why they'd want
to come to our world, can you?

30
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,099
Now you mention it,
ma'am, I can't either.

31
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,600
We seem so terribly
overcrowded already, don't we?

32
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,100
It was different when I
was a girl, quite different.

33
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,351
Superintendent. Ah, your umbrella,
ma'am. You left it behind.

34
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,351
I'm always leaving it.

35
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,852
I don't like it very much,
really. Perhaps that's the reason.

36
00:04:10,852 --> 00:04:13,852
Well, I won't keep you, superintendent.

37
00:04:13,852 --> 00:04:16,852
Thank you very much for
being so understanding.

38
00:04:16,852 --> 00:04:19,354
Thank you, Mrs. Wilberforce,
for being so helpful.

39
00:04:19,354 --> 00:04:21,854
We're always more than
pleased to see you.

40
00:04:21,854 --> 00:04:23,854
Thank you.

41
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:26,104
[Thunderclap]

42
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,940
Miss Whipple, has there been
anyone about the advertisement?

43
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,441
[Responds, indistinct]

44
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:49,357
Never mind.

45
00:04:54,817 --> 00:04:57,858
Thank you all the same, miss Whipple.

46
00:05:15,362 --> 00:05:20,446
[Birds squawking] [bird] here we
are. Come on then. Come on. Here we are.

47
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:23,988
All right. All right. Pretty Polly.

48
00:05:24,447 --> 00:05:27,448
All right, my dear.

49
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,948
I haven't been gone so very
long, have I? Pretty Polly.

50
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:31,948
Oh, darling. Water.

51
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:37,990
[Screeching] help, help!

52
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,115
"That's the time they long for"

53
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,616
[pipes clanging]

54
00:05:45,616 --> 00:05:47,616
[Water gurgling]

55
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,616
[Gurgling stops]

56
00:06:01,618 --> 00:06:03,118
[Train whistle blows]

57
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,120
[Bird] help!

58
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
[Trilling] hey, over here.

59
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:19,872
- [Bell ringing]
- [Chitters]

60
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:28,707
Mrs. Wilberforce? Yes?

61
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:32,873
I understand you have rooms to let.

62
00:06:32,873 --> 00:06:36,373
Oh, the rooms, yes. Won't you
come in, please? Thank you.

63
00:06:36,373 --> 00:06:38,874
My name's Marcus. How
do you do, Mr. Marcus?

64
00:06:39,374 --> 00:06:41,874
Professor Marcus. Oh,
how do you do, professor?

65
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:44,374
Yes, I have two,
right back... yes.

66
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,876
Would you excuse me a moment
while I put this away, please?

67
00:07:04,212 --> 00:07:08,713
I'm afraid it's quite impossible to
make it hang evenly, professor Marcus.

68
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:10,713
Because of the subsidence.

69
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,714
Subsidence? From the bombing.

70
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:16,214
None of the pictures will.
You have no other lodgers?

71
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:19,715
Oh, no. The upper floors are
no longer structurally sound.

72
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:22,715
But the two rooms at the
rear, they're quite all right.

73
00:07:22,715 --> 00:07:25,715
Then you live here all alone? Yes.

74
00:07:25,715 --> 00:07:30,716
I think I should tell you, professor, I'm
unable to provide breakfast or early morning tea.

75
00:07:31,216 --> 00:07:32,716
This is the sitting room.

76
00:07:33,216 --> 00:07:35,216
And the bedroom is just down here.

77
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,717
These rooms do need
an airing, don't they?

78
00:07:38,217 --> 00:07:40,718
I'm afraid there's no proper service.

79
00:07:40,718 --> 00:07:45,634
- And the view is, well...
- [whistle blowing]

80
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:48,968
Most exhilarating.

81
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,220
The rooms will suit me
admirably, Mrs. Wilberforce.

82
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh.

83
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,220
I shall move in tomorrow if that
is convenient to you. Tomorrow?

84
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,136
Oh. [bird] hello.

85
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:03,637
What's that? Who's talking?

86
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,638
It's only general Gordon. He
belonged to my late husband.

87
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,638
I had four. Husbands?

88
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:12,639
No, parrots. And now
I've only three. Parrots.

89
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,639
Of course, one small
point, Mrs. Wilberforce.

90
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,639
Some friends and I have
formed a small musical group.

91
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
A string quintet, in fact.

92
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,140
Then you're a musician,
a professor of music?

93
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,640
No, no, no. Merely an
amateur, you understand.

94
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,640
But we have been looking
for somewhere to practice.

95
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,141
Now, would it be agreeable to you
if... if you were to practice here?

96
00:08:32,641 --> 00:08:35,642
Oh, professor Marcus,
I should be delighted.

97
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:38,642
I've always loved music.

98
00:08:38,642 --> 00:08:42,142
Now, if you'll come into my
sitting room, I'll find you a key.

99
00:08:42,142 --> 00:08:45,144
I've got a spare one
here somewhere in my desk.

100
00:08:45,144 --> 00:08:47,644
I'll let you have it. Then
you can let yourself in...

101
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,644
should I happen to be
out when you arrive.

102
00:08:50,644 --> 00:08:53,144
You know, I shall be able to
let my friends in of an evening.

103
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:56,145
They can come and go without
disturbing you. [shrieks]

104
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:59,146
Oh, it wouldn't disturb me
in the least. [shrieks]

105
00:08:59,146 --> 00:09:04,646
I have very few friends. It'll be very
pleasant having someone in the house again.

106
00:09:04,646 --> 00:09:08,147
These are my three little companions.

107
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,147
You see? This is general Gordon,

108
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:13,647
that's admiral Beatty
and this one is called...

109
00:09:13,856 --> 00:09:15,898
Mildred.

110
00:09:15,898 --> 00:09:17,898
I should like to pay
a few weeks in advance.

111
00:09:17,898 --> 00:09:21,898
Three guineas, I think the... no, please. That
will do quite well when you come tomorrow.

112
00:09:21,898 --> 00:09:24,858
I shall have the rooms aired.
If there's anything I can do,

113
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,484
I do hope you won't hesitate to ask.

114
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,984
You are most kind. And if I may say so,

115
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:33,984
you have a very curious
and charming house.

116
00:09:33,984 --> 00:09:36,484
Such pretty windows. [whistle blowing]

117
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:38,486
Thank you. I'm rather
afraid the position...

118
00:09:38,486 --> 00:09:41,986
I always think the windows
are the eyes of a house.

119
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:47,487
And didn't someone say, "the
eyes are the windows of the soul"?

120
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,488
I don't really know, but
it's such a charming thought.

121
00:09:50,488 --> 00:09:52,988
I do hope someone expressed it.

122
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:55,488
Well, au revoir.

123
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:59,530
Good morning, professor
Marcus. Till tomorrow.

124
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,739
Did you understand all that?

125
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:09,240
We're going to have
a guest in the house.

126
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,740
[Chitters] "but I saw them last
night having, oh, such a time"

127
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:16,741
"in the twilight"

128
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:25,992
[bell rings]

129
00:10:30,952 --> 00:10:33,952
All right, Mrs.
Wilberforce. I'll answer it.

130
00:10:33,952 --> 00:10:36,994
It must be my friends.

131
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:45,996
Ah, good evening, major Courtney.

132
00:10:46,996 --> 00:10:49,496
[Chuckles] good evening, professor.

133
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,997
I hope I'm not too early.
Not at all. Not at all.

134
00:10:51,997 --> 00:10:55,955
Mrs. Wilberforce, may I
present major Courtney?

135
00:10:56,497 --> 00:10:59,497
How do you do, Mrs.
Wilberforce? I'm honored.

136
00:10:59,997 --> 00:11:02,498
[Bell rings]

137
00:11:02,498 --> 00:11:04,498
Come in, gentlemen. Come in.

138
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:09,499
May I introduce Mr. Lawson? How
do you do, gentlemen? Mr. Lawson.

139
00:11:09,957 --> 00:11:13,000
And Mr. Robinson. Mrs. Wilberforce.

140
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
- Mr. Robinson.
- All right. Thank you.

141
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,000
- You're the cellist, Mr. Lawson?
- Uh, what, ma'am?

142
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,002
He's the cellist.
Yeah. I'm the, uh...

143
00:11:24,002 --> 00:11:28,002
there's only Mr. Harvey to come.
I think perhaps we might, uh,

144
00:11:28,002 --> 00:11:31,002
go upstairs. Yes. Yes.

145
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:35,503
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilberforce.
Oh, I'm so sorry, major.

146
00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:42,754
Here. What's all this about, doc?

147
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:47,255
Take out your instruments.
Not "doc" this time, Harry.

148
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:50,255
Professor. [bell rings]

149
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:59,256
Good evening, Mr. Harvey.
It is Mr. Harvey, isn't it?

150
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,506
Yes, it is Mr. Harvey.

151
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:03,507
[Laughing] come in. Come in.

152
00:12:03,507 --> 00:12:06,008
The others are all here.

153
00:12:09,008 --> 00:12:12,508
Our Mrs. Wilberforce.

154
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,510
The temperamental one. Oh.

155
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,010
I do hope you'll be
comfortable, gentlemen. Upstairs.

156
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,010
And I do wish you
well with your efforts.

157
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,010
Professor Marcus has
told me so much about you.

158
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,512
I really must just tell
you how very happy I am...

159
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:33,012
- to have you all here.
- Thank you.

160
00:12:37,263 --> 00:12:39,263
Who's she?

161
00:12:39,263 --> 00:12:41,763
What does she mean you
told her so much about us?

162
00:12:41,763 --> 00:12:43,763
We supposed to make
noises with these things?

163
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,763
What kind of noises? Who is she?

164
00:12:45,763 --> 00:12:48,264
Not noises, one round, music.

165
00:12:48,264 --> 00:12:50,764
I said, what does
she mean, you... shh.

166
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:22,603
[Pipes clanging]

167
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:24,603
[Water gurgling]

168
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:27,103
[Gurgling stops]

169
00:13:27,103 --> 00:13:29,103
[Gurgling]

170
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,354
I tell you, it makes no sense.

171
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:37,354
If we have to have someone to bring
out the money, let's get a professional.

172
00:13:37,354 --> 00:13:39,854
We'll bring it out ourselves. Make
a spectacular getaway, you mean.

173
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:44,855
At 70 miles an hour in the heart
of London in broad daylight.

174
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:48,606
We'll take it back into the
station... and send it out by train.

175
00:13:48,606 --> 00:13:51,607
What any intelligent policeman
would expect us to do.

176
00:13:51,607 --> 00:13:53,607
You've quite a flair,
Louis, for the obvious.

177
00:13:53,607 --> 00:13:58,357
Can't you appreciate that Mrs. Wilberforce
is not a mere appendage to my plan,

178
00:13:58,357 --> 00:14:00,357
she's the very core of it.

179
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:04,359
A lopsided old grandma. Yeah.

180
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:09,026
How do we know we can trust her to do it
right if she don't even know what she's doing?

181
00:14:09,026 --> 00:14:11,109
One round?

182
00:14:11,609 --> 00:14:14,611
Sweet little old lady like
her, it just don't seem right...

183
00:14:14,611 --> 00:14:17,611
for her to be working
with us on a stickup caper.

184
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:21,861
I tell you, I don't like old ladies.
I don't like having them around.

185
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,362
I can't stand them.

186
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:26,612
[Knocking]

187
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,363
[Grunts]

188
00:14:53,365 --> 00:14:56,367
I thought perhaps before
you've all become too absorbed,

189
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,367
you and your guests
might like a cup of tea.

190
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:02,867
Oh, you shouldn't. You know, professor,

191
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:06,368
you didn't tell me the
truth about yourself...

192
00:15:06,368 --> 00:15:08,869
and these other gentlemen.

193
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:12,369
You're not the least bit like amateurs.

194
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,870
You really must be professionals.
You're every bit as good.

195
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,370
Not quite. Though we are rather proud...

196
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,870
of Mr. Harvey's timbre.

197
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,871
And that pizzicato passage,
Mr. Lawson... quite delightful.

198
00:15:26,871 --> 00:15:30,871
May I ask you where you studied?

199
00:15:30,871 --> 00:15:35,372
Well, I didn't really study
anyplace, lady. I just picked it up.

200
00:15:35,372 --> 00:15:39,373
You know, I was so surprised when
I heard what you were playing.

201
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:44,873
It brought back something that really
I'd completely forgotten all about.

202
00:15:44,873 --> 00:15:46,873
My 21st birthday party.

203
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:50,875
You see, my father had
engaged a string quintet...

204
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,375
to come in and play in the evening.

205
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,875
And while they were playing Boccherini,

206
00:15:55,875 --> 00:16:00,877
someone came in and said the
old queen had passed away.

207
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:02,877
Then everyone went home.

208
00:16:02,877 --> 00:16:06,377
And that was the end of my party.

209
00:16:06,377 --> 00:16:09,878
All that time ago in pang Bourne.

210
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,545
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll run and make the tea.

211
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,045
The kettle must be nearly on the boil.

212
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:21,379
Who's she talking about? Old queen who?

213
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:24,879
Look, I don't care how we do this
job, but let's leave her out of it.

214
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,880
I say, hadn't we
better discuss it later?

215
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,881
I don't want to discuss it. I
want it settled here and now.

216
00:16:29,881 --> 00:16:34,381
All right, Louis. I'll
put it to the vote.

217
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:39,381
But understand this: No one is
indispensable, and certainly not you, Louis.

218
00:16:39,381 --> 00:16:42,883
Only the plan is essential,
the plan, my plan.

219
00:16:42,883 --> 00:16:47,633
Major, if we don't use Mrs. "w",

220
00:16:47,633 --> 00:16:50,634
if we call in someone else, we'll
each have to take a smaller cut.

221
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,134
Yes. Good, we
see eye-to-eye.

222
00:16:53,134 --> 00:16:56,635
I don't care what it means, I want her
out of it. Two for her, one against.

223
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:02,303
Harry? I just don't think we can
depend on a screwy old dame like that.

224
00:17:02,303 --> 00:17:04,803
It's up to you, one round.

225
00:17:07,303 --> 00:17:09,803
Uh.

226
00:17:09,803 --> 00:17:13,804
You going to leave a decision like this
to a thick-eared muscle man like him?

227
00:17:13,804 --> 00:17:17,304
How would he know? What do you
mean? I got a vote too, ain't I?

228
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:20,805
It's a democracy, ain't it? And
what's the matter with muscle anyway?

229
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:24,806
Okay, I'm with you and the major.
Mrs. Lopsided just got elected.

230
00:17:25,306 --> 00:17:27,306
Of all the stupid ways to decide. Bravo.

231
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:31,306
A majority decision to
do the intelligent thing.

232
00:17:31,306 --> 00:17:35,808
Louis, you accept that decision, or you
pack up your fiddle and play elsewhere.

233
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:41,808
All right. But there's just one thing.

234
00:17:41,808 --> 00:17:44,809
I've never worked with you before,
and I don't know anything about you.

235
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:49,810
But major has, and he says you've got
quite a reputation as a master brain.

236
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,768
He'd better be right. If you do your
job as well as Mrs. "w" will do hers,

237
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:57,311
I shall be well satisfied.
You just worry about your plan.

238
00:17:57,311 --> 00:18:02,394
'Cause her part sounds like something somebody
dreamt up in the booby hatch to while away...

239
00:18:04,394 --> 00:18:07,312
[door creaking]

240
00:18:08,812 --> 00:18:11,812
Well, now. Shall I be mother?

241
00:18:17,147 --> 00:18:22,147
[Woman on p.a.] train now
arriving at platform one...

242
00:18:22,147 --> 00:18:25,689
is the one-five from Cambridge.

243
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:34,483
Excuse
me, major Courtney,

244
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:37,025
I wonder if perhaps you'd like some tea?

245
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:40,023
I wonder if perhaps you'd
like some tea, major Courtney?

246
00:19:40,523 --> 00:19:45,523
No, thank you, Mrs.
Wilberforce. Please don't bother.

247
00:19:51,021 --> 00:19:54,020
I could make some
coffee if you'd prefer.

248
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,019
No, thank you. You're
very kind. Thank you.

249
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:03,020
[Knocking]

250
00:20:06,393 --> 00:20:09,393
- Yes, Mrs. Wilberforce?
- So sorry to bother you, major.

251
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:13,351
But before you start again, would
one of you hold general Gordon for me?

252
00:20:13,351 --> 00:20:17,350
I have to give him his medicine, you
see. I can't quite manage by myself.

253
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,348
Mr. Robinson, would you mind
giving Mrs. Wilberforce a hand?

254
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:22,848
It's a pleasure, Mrs.
Wilberforce, I assure you.

255
00:20:22,848 --> 00:20:25,849
I hope that all you gentlemen will
excuse me. Extremely kind, Mr. Robinson.

256
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,348
He does dislike taking his medicine, but
if somebody... I'll do it right away for you.

257
00:20:29,348 --> 00:20:31,389
I'm afraid it's rather nasty.

258
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:34,847
I'd better ask the vet to make
it a little more palatable.

259
00:20:34,847 --> 00:20:38,345
You leave it to me, ma'am. I'm
very good with birds. Oh, really?

260
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:43,886
Tea, coffee, mend the plumbing,
give the parrot his medicine.

261
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:46,344
Give the parrot his medicine?

262
00:20:51,842 --> 00:20:56,385
- [Harry] Ow!
- Oh, I'm so sorry. I do apologize.

263
00:20:56,385 --> 00:21:00,342
No, no, no. I assure you, he's
never bitten anyone before.

264
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,841
Hasn't he?

265
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,508
I wonder how we're to get
him down. [squawking]

266
00:21:05,508 --> 00:21:08,466
I am so sorry, Mr.
Robinson. I'll get a bandage.

267
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:11,007
No, don't bother, Mrs.
Wilberforce. It's all right.

268
00:21:11,215 --> 00:21:15,130
- Swab the decks. - swab the decks
yourself, you filthy-looking...

269
00:21:16,339 --> 00:21:20,339
oh, dear. Oh, dear. Poor Mr. Robinson.

270
00:21:22,338 --> 00:21:24,379
I'm so sorry, major Courtney,

271
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:27,837
but I'm afraid general Gordon
has bitten Mr. Robinson's finger.

272
00:21:27,837 --> 00:21:31,336
Now he's on top of the cabinet
and refuses to come down.

273
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:35,834
Mr. Robinson is on top of the cabinet?
No, Mr. Harvey. General Gordon.

274
00:21:35,834 --> 00:21:37,835
Mr. Lawson, you're the tallest.

275
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:40,334
Do you think you could
try to get him down for us?

276
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:43,374
Sure, I'll get him, ma'am.

277
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:47,332
I feel I'm being such a bother. How could
you possibly think a thing like that?

278
00:21:47,332 --> 00:21:49,374
Oh, you are kind.

279
00:21:49,374 --> 00:21:53,832
...very fond of parrots, and they were
at sea for many years with my husband.

280
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:56,331
Here, I'll do it.

281
00:21:56,331 --> 00:21:59,832
- All right, Pavlova.
- Captain Wilberforce was in the mercantile marines.

282
00:22:00,331 --> 00:22:03,830
- [Bird cackling]
- [Wilberforce] oh, be quiet, you naughty bird.

283
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,328
[Bird] hello. Come here, birdie.

284
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:09,329
[Creaking] do be careful, Mr. Lawson.

285
00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:12,829
[Harry laughing] general
Gordon, general Gordon.

286
00:22:12,829 --> 00:22:15,328
Mr. Robinson, do catch him.

287
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:17,828
Do catch him. Mr. Lawson, it's all
right. He'll help you in a minute.

288
00:22:17,828 --> 00:22:23,326
General Gordon. Don't open the
door, major. He mustn't get out.

289
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:25,325
Oh, major,
could you help...

290
00:22:25,325 --> 00:22:27,325
Mr. Lawson... no,
you're in the chair.

291
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,866
Mr. Robinson. Give us a hand, will you?

292
00:22:29,866 --> 00:22:33,491
- [Wilberforce]... in the conservatory.

293
00:22:36,115 --> 00:22:37,573
Oh!

294
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,072
I'll get him for you.

295
00:22:51,072 --> 00:22:54,071
Yes, he'll get him. Here,
general. Nice birdie.

296
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,568
[Screeches]

297
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:13,568
What are you doing? Him.

298
00:23:13,568 --> 00:23:16,067
Steady, steady. No
violence. What are you doing?

299
00:23:16,566 --> 00:23:19,566
- [Wilberforce] there he goes.
- Surely the three of you can catch a parrot.

300
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:22,564
But there's no ladder. Somebody
has to go out of the window.

301
00:23:22,564 --> 00:23:24,564
Go on, then.

302
00:23:24,564 --> 00:23:28,063
Lend him a hand. Get him. I'm
wounded in the hand. Get him yourself.

303
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:30,562
Oh, I do apologize for the disturbance.

304
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:33,063
Now, you really mustn't trouble anymore.

305
00:23:33,063 --> 00:23:35,563
You know, the last time
I just phoned the police.

306
00:23:35,563 --> 00:23:38,562
And they came round with the
fire brigade and long ladders.

307
00:23:38,562 --> 00:23:41,061
Oh, the wicked, wicked bird.

308
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:43,560
It's always general Gordon too.
He's the naughty one. That's right.

309
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,562
Don't worry about the
police or the fire brigade.

310
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:48,560
I'm not chasing any parrot. I
don't care if he's a field marshal.

311
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:51,060
Land ahoy!

312
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:54,225
Oh, dear. General Gordon.

313
00:23:54,727 --> 00:23:56,226
I'm not too keen on heights, you know.

314
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,226
Never mind. You stay where you are.

315
00:23:58,226 --> 00:24:00,225
I'll get him. [bird] all aboard.

316
00:24:00,726 --> 00:24:04,307
- [One round] sorry, ma'am... - it's
all right. You couldn't help it.

317
00:24:05,808 --> 00:24:09,806
Oh, Mr. Lawson. That's great.
Now he's flown off again.

318
00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:14,555
[Yells]

319
00:24:14,555 --> 00:24:18,555
[Wilberforce] major, was that
your nose? Are you all right?

320
00:24:21,054 --> 00:24:23,553
Pretty Polly.

321
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:30,553
Good morning, Louis.

322
00:24:32,552 --> 00:24:37,552
Why, there he is. I am so
sorry you've been disturbed.

323
00:24:38,052 --> 00:24:41,051
Poor darling, he does so
dislike taking his medicine.

324
00:24:41,051 --> 00:24:44,050
I think that he's been so upset...

325
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,549
I'll leave it until tomorrow.

326
00:24:46,549 --> 00:24:48,550
Right, tomorrow.

327
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,549
Oh, professor, as the practice
has already been interrupted,

328
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:56,048
are you quite sure you wouldn't like
any... no, thank you, Mrs. Wilberforce.

329
00:24:56,048 --> 00:24:58,548
No tea. Thank you all the same.

330
00:24:58,548 --> 00:25:03,047
Oh, well. I'll make quite sure
you're not disturbed again.

331
00:25:03,546 --> 00:25:05,046
[Wilberforce] I'm ashamed of you.

332
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:09,545
Ashamed of you causing all
this... [bird squawking]

333
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:12,212
Such a disturbance. I'm
going to shut you in.

334
00:25:12,212 --> 00:25:14,211
But you were a good little girl.

335
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:17,710
Naughty
Polly. Naughty Polly.

336
00:25:35,624 --> 00:25:38,290
Nervous, Louis?

337
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:41,289
Let's get started. Yeah.

338
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,784
Now, Harry. The gun.

339
00:26:11,284 --> 00:26:13,784
Right. Thank you.

340
00:27:31,353 --> 00:27:33,852
[Tires screeching]

341
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:37,352
Hey, what do you think you're
trying to do? Hey, move on.

342
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,350
Go on, get a move on.
We want to get past here.

343
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:45,849
What's the big idea? You're
in our way. [honking horn]

344
00:27:45,849 --> 00:27:48,849
Get out of here, will you? Oh.

345
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:52,348
[Horns honking, distant]

346
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,846
[Blow thuds]

347
00:28:04,846 --> 00:28:07,344
[Honking continues, distant]

348
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,758
There's no driver here.
Now, what's all this about?

349
00:28:46,754 --> 00:28:50,254
[Man] take the hand
brake off, will you?

350
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:52,255
[All chattering, indistinct]

351
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,002
Hey!

352
00:29:02,003 --> 00:29:04,336
[Whistle blows]

353
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,834
[Whistle blows]

354
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:16,833
[Tires screeching]

355
00:29:21,331 --> 00:29:23,332
[Whistle blows]

356
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,830
Disturbance at King's Cross.

357
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:56,170
[Woman on p.a.] the train
now arriving at platform one...

358
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,003
is the one-five from Cambridge.

359
00:30:07,922 --> 00:30:10,922
- [Man] Here, Charlie. Take this lot up to parcels.
- Yeah, all right.

360
00:30:26,924 --> 00:30:30,924
Hello, M-2.G.W., from H.P.C.
Urgent message. Begins...

361
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:34,925
car believed concerned in armed robbery, King's
Cross area, found abandoned in field street.

362
00:30:34,925 --> 00:30:39,426
It's the one, hmm? There is
no trace of stolen property.

363
00:30:39,426 --> 00:30:41,926
[Horn honks]

364
00:30:50,511 --> 00:30:53,511
[Superintendent] it'll disorganize
the entire running of the trains.

365
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:56,011
We know, but we've gotta check
all luggage going out of here.

366
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:58,012
You can't hold up traffic
on a mainline station.

367
00:30:58,012 --> 00:31:01,513
We're sure the stuff was brought in here.
They'll try and ship it out under our noses.

368
00:31:04,763 --> 00:31:07,263
[Man] we've gotta check all
the exits. They must be inside.

369
00:31:07,263 --> 00:31:09,264
Yes, all right. I'll phone the yard.

370
00:31:19,515 --> 00:31:22,515
[Man] but in broad daylight?
I mind me own business.

371
00:31:22,515 --> 00:31:26,015
If you don't mind,
just open up. Excuse me.

372
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:28,016
Sure. It belongs to me aunt Kate.

373
00:31:28,016 --> 00:31:31,017
She's just after dying and
leaving me a few old knickknacks.

374
00:31:31,017 --> 00:31:34,517
Family items.
Keepsakes, you might...

375
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:38,017
excuse me. Could you tell me
where I'd go to collect a trunk?

376
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:42,019
Just over there, madam, where
it says "parcels." thank you.

377
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:50,270
Now, how many pieces of luggage have you
booked in in the last 10 to 15 minutes?

378
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:52,770
Excuse me. Just a minute, lady.

379
00:31:53,271 --> 00:31:56,271
You mean going out or coming in?
Going out, leaving the station!

380
00:31:56,271 --> 00:31:59,271
How many? I'll have to check.

381
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:02,272
It's a trunk. Professor
Marcus, who lodges with me,

382
00:32:02,272 --> 00:32:05,272
is having a trunk sent
up from... where was it?

383
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:07,772
Cambridge. He's leaving today.

384
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:11,440
Coming in from Cambridge
for Marcus. Right.

385
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,940
Will you sign for it, please, ma'am?

386
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,940
There it
is, right...

387
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,441
going out, how many?

388
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:23,442
Let me look at the list, will you?

389
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
[Rings]

390
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,861
Now, major, before we start,
let's press button "a," shall we?

391
00:32:46,862 --> 00:32:50,862
[Major] it's the police. [
continues, indistinct] that's better.

392
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:53,863
Major, I want you to keep calm,

393
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,863
speak quietly and concentrate.

394
00:32:57,363 --> 00:33:00,363
Have you got that? Splendid.

395
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:04,864
Mrs. "w" should be coming
into view just about...

396
00:33:06,764 --> 00:33:08,564
now.

397
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:16,866
[No audible dialogue]

398
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:19,866
Now she's driving away.

399
00:33:52,288 --> 00:33:54,288
[No audible dialogue]

400
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,872
Major, major, major.

401
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:05,373
Relax! Calm down!

402
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:10,374
Back to the station. She's
come back to the station.

403
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:17,791
What's wrong? Major, major, what's
happening? Louis, Louis, Louis.

404
00:34:17,791 --> 00:34:19,793
Major? Louis, will you mind
your own business, please?

405
00:34:19,793 --> 00:34:23,793
[Train whistles]

406
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:28,793
Louis, Louis. Hello, major?

407
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:30,794
Get out. You get out.

408
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:32,795
Major, tell me what's happening.

409
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:40,629
I'm always leaving it.

410
00:34:43,629 --> 00:34:45,629
[Laughing] tell me, what's she doing?

411
00:34:45,629 --> 00:34:48,629
What's going on here? It's all right.

412
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:53,130
It's just that she went
back to get her umbrella.

413
00:35:14,801 --> 00:35:17,801
She could've shocked
us all. The silly old...

414
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:20,301
what you knocking her for?
She done it, didn't she?

415
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:24,302
We're nearly home, Louis.
What can possibly go wrong now?

416
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:26,303
Driver, stop at once!

417
00:35:26,553 --> 00:35:30,553
Don't do that again! I say!

418
00:35:31,053 --> 00:35:34,554
Young man, stop that.
Young man, did you hear me?

419
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:37,054
What are you doing to that horse?

420
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,804
[Man] get out of
here. Is this your horse?

421
00:35:40,804 --> 00:35:44,305
Go on, get out of here! Go on, get out!

422
00:35:44,805 --> 00:35:48,805
Shoo! Go on. Get out of it.

423
00:35:48,805 --> 00:35:51,306
Young man.

424
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:54,390
Do you mind? Now, go on, get out of it.

425
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,390
Get this horse out of the way there.

426
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:58,432
Whose horse is it? You
leave that horse alone!

427
00:35:58,932 --> 00:36:01,390
Look, missus, will you mind your
own business? And don't prod.

428
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,390
Get out of here! The
poor, defenseless animal.

429
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:05,892
But, missus, you don't understand.

430
00:36:05,892 --> 00:36:07,892
He's been following me all the
way down from Burton Street.

431
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:09,892
He's had three pounds
of my best pippins.

432
00:36:10,392 --> 00:36:12,392
Let's see, that's one in
six... he's at it again.

433
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:14,392
Go on, get out of here.

434
00:36:14,392 --> 00:36:17,894
No, now stop it this instant or I
shall report you to the authorities.

435
00:36:18,394 --> 00:36:22,394
Look, missus, will you mind your
own business? Driver, driver.

436
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:25,895
Look, if you like the horse, if you don't
want me to break all four of its legs,

437
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:27,895
get him out of here!

438
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:31,395
Driver, I insist that you do
something to stop this vicious brute.

439
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:34,395
Listen, lady, this is no business
of ours. Keep out of this.

440
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:37,063
I'm warning you! Keep out!

441
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:40,063
Keep out! Now get the
old witch out of here!

442
00:36:40,063 --> 00:36:43,563
[Wilberforce] the poor, innocent animal.
He's hungry. You don't feed him enough.

443
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:49,065
Are you going to stand there while
this hooligan... look, he's at it again!

444
00:36:49,565 --> 00:36:53,065
Boy, go for a constable.
No, lady, please.

445
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:02,067
Now,
listen...

446
00:37:02,067 --> 00:37:04,567
[all laughing]

447
00:37:04,567 --> 00:37:07,567
- [Laughter continues]
- Now, steady on.

448
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,569
Stop it, I
say. How disgr...

449
00:37:10,569 --> 00:37:12,569
- [whinnies]
- [Shrieks]

450
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,278
Bogies, I knew it.
Let's get out of here.

451
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:26,320
No, slowly. Drive round
the corner and come back.

452
00:37:28,153 --> 00:37:34,029
Constable. This ruffian has
been behaving disgracefully.

453
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:36,071
What's all this about?

454
00:37:36,071 --> 00:37:38,072
[All clamoring, indistinct]

455
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:41,031
What about my barrow?

456
00:37:41,031 --> 00:37:43,073
[Shouting]

457
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:51,658
- Where's my horse?
- Stop that!

458
00:37:55,658 --> 00:37:59,158
Where's my horse?

459
00:37:59,158 --> 00:38:02,326
Where's my horse? [man] all
right, what's going on here?

460
00:38:02,326 --> 00:38:06,327
How did all this get started?
Constable. I can explain.

461
00:38:06,827 --> 00:38:09,827
Officer, he started it. Look what
he's done to my cab. I started it?

462
00:38:09,827 --> 00:38:11,786
Your cab? What about my barrow?

463
00:38:12,286 --> 00:38:14,828
What about my wagon?
And where's my horse?

464
00:38:28,496 --> 00:38:32,498
I don't believe it. I
don't believe it. Shut up!

465
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,498
It's just sitting there.
Look, couldn't we...

466
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:38,998
no one, I hope, is going
to suggest that we steal it.

467
00:38:39,123 --> 00:38:42,164
[Crowd clamoring]

468
00:38:45,125 --> 00:38:47,166
[Man] quiet, quiet!

469
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,000
What's going on, sergeant? There's
been a fight in the street, sir.

470
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,500
I'm so glad you're here. Mrs.
Wilberforce, what are you doing here?

471
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,042
This lout has been behaving... you know
her and you let her walk around loose?

472
00:38:56,502 --> 00:38:58,502
Now, none of that! Don't
you distress yourself, ma'am.

473
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,002
You don't know what she's done. Be
quiet or I'll have you put in charge.

474
00:39:01,002 --> 00:39:03,002
Look what she
did... be quiet!

475
00:39:03,002 --> 00:39:07,003
You better go home, ma'am. If we
need a statement, we'll call on you.

476
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:09,503
Wilson, take this lady home. Use my car.

477
00:39:09,503 --> 00:39:15,004
And it's a brown horse, 11 years old
and answers to the name of Dennis.

478
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:24,421
[Tires screeching]

479
00:39:37,424 --> 00:39:39,924
This way, please.

480
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,884
Could you put it there?

481
00:39:47,884 --> 00:39:51,426
That's right. Ah.

482
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:54,385
It's so good of you. I do
hope I haven't been a bother.

483
00:39:54,385 --> 00:39:56,926
No, ma'am. It's all right.

484
00:39:56,926 --> 00:39:59,886
Good afternoon.

485
00:40:17,513 --> 00:40:20,514
Harry, the police. They're at the
house. They're actually in the house.

486
00:40:20,514 --> 00:40:23,555
But where are the others?

487
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:26,514
The bogies brought it home
for her. What did you expect?

488
00:40:27,014 --> 00:40:29,057
[Bell rings]

489
00:40:39,517 --> 00:40:41,558
"In the twilight"

490
00:40:41,558 --> 00:40:45,018
"in the beautiful twilight"

491
00:40:45,018 --> 00:40:47,518
"they all go out"

492
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,519
ah, professor. Good
afternoon, gentlemen.

493
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,519
[Laughing] your last rehearsal.

494
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:03,520
Ah, professor, I must give
you back your ten shillings.

495
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,020
Thank you. The cab man
wouldn't take any money...

496
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,521
because he said he was going
into some other business.

497
00:41:42,192 --> 00:41:45,193
How about that, eh?

498
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:49,693
How about that?

499
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:12,113
Right. Got it?

500
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,282
You know, I was even hoping
you'd be able to play for them.

501
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:22,782
Oh, yes, Boccherini.

502
00:42:22,782 --> 00:42:27,783
You know, if only you could have
stayed just a few minutes longer.

503
00:42:27,783 --> 00:42:31,284
They will be so disappointed
to have missed you.

504
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:34,284
And as for me, well,
I'm sad to see you go.

505
00:42:37,785 --> 00:42:40,785
Gotta get my cello upstairs.

506
00:42:41,035 --> 00:42:43,535
I only hope you've enjoyed
it as much as I have.

507
00:42:43,535 --> 00:42:45,535
Indeed we have, madam,
thank you, thank you.

508
00:42:45,535 --> 00:42:47,536
Good-bye, major Courtney.

509
00:42:47,536 --> 00:42:50,994
And I do wish you good
fortune in your travels.

510
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:55,537
Thank you very much. Oh,
indeed, I do. Oh, I'm so sorry.

511
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:03,871
Good-bye, professor
Marcus. Good-bye, gentlemen.

512
00:43:04,371 --> 00:43:07,915
Good-bye.
Tootle-oo.

513
00:43:12,873 --> 00:43:14,415
Mr. Lawson, I must tell you,

514
00:43:14,873 --> 00:43:18,374
when I was listening to your playing
of that andante passage a while ago,

515
00:43:18,374 --> 00:43:22,875
I thought it the most sensitive
playing I'd ever heard.

516
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:25,375
You thought it was good,
eh? Oh, yes. Yes, indeed.

517
00:43:25,875 --> 00:43:29,876
Bye-bye, missus, luv.
Bye-bye, Mrs. Wilberforce.

518
00:43:29,876 --> 00:43:31,876
Thanks for the nice tea and everything.

519
00:43:31,876 --> 00:43:33,876
Not at all.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

520
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:45,669
What is that moron playing at?

521
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:50,129
It's stuck in the door.
The case is stuck...

522
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:53,629
well, ring the bell, brains.
Don't just stand there.

523
00:43:55,629 --> 00:43:57,671
[Rings] thank you.

524
00:44:17,383 --> 00:44:22,426
It's all right, Mrs. Wilberforce.
Everything's under control. Good-bye.

525
00:44:31,801 --> 00:44:33,802
Good-bye.

526
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:38,135
Get over in the car there.
Hey, that's my money.

527
00:44:58,556 --> 00:45:00,306
Go on. Wait a minute. Stop and think.

528
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:03,306
We haven't the time. Drive
on. I said wait a minute!

529
00:45:03,306 --> 00:45:05,307
What are we going to do about her?

530
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:12,933
[All clamoring, indistinct
] make your mind up.

531
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:18,392
I tell you, we must do
something. She knows.

532
00:45:18,392 --> 00:45:23,392
She saw the money. She'll talk. And my
picture's on file and so is Harry’s and yours.

533
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:27,393
If they take her down to the gallery, she'll
shop us. They've got our fingers and thumbs.

534
00:45:59,899 --> 00:46:02,899
Professor Marcus, I don't
quite know how to say this...

535
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:05,899
I suppose you're wondering about
the money in Mr. Lawson's cello case.

536
00:46:06,399 --> 00:46:07,900
Why, it's only natural that you should.

537
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,400
I don't think we told you that Mr. Lawson
sold his butcher shop in Hammersmith.

538
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,400
That's right, I did. Yes,
yes. He got the cash for it...

539
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:18,901
'cause there wasn't time
to, uh, write a check.

540
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,401
I still don't quite understand.

541
00:46:21,401 --> 00:46:23,401
You're wondering about the music.

542
00:46:23,401 --> 00:46:26,902
You're wondering how Mr. Lawson...

543
00:46:26,902 --> 00:46:31,403
uh, is able to play... [chuckling]

544
00:46:31,403 --> 00:46:35,403
Without a
cello. Yes, but...

545
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:37,403
yes, he's going on this tour,

546
00:46:37,403 --> 00:46:41,905
and all he's got in
there is... and no cello.

547
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:44,905
We must get her out of here. A snatch?

548
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:46,905
Get her into the car. [bell rings]

549
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:56,407
- Good afternoon, Louisa.
- Afternoon, Amelia.

550
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:59,407
Do come in.
These are...

551
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:02,408
oh, then you were able
to stay to tea after all.

552
00:47:02,408 --> 00:47:06,908
How very, very nice.
What an exciting surprise.

553
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:10,408
We'll have to take them both. We've
got to get away. [bell rings]

554
00:47:10,408 --> 00:47:13,409
Excuse me, won't you?

555
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:19,410
Professor Marcus... Constance, good
afternoon. And Hypatia. How are you?

556
00:47:19,410 --> 00:47:22,411
Let me present these gentlemen.

557
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:24,911
Amelia, you've met professor
Marcus and this is major Courtney.

558
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:28,411
Hypatia, have you met major Courtney?

559
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:33,413
[All continue chattering] what do
you think we should do, charter a bus?

560
00:47:33,413 --> 00:47:36,913
Mr. Robinson and Mr. Harvey.

561
00:47:46,915 --> 00:47:51,415
Lettice, oh, dear. Oh,
Louisa, I'm so sorry I'm late.

562
00:47:51,415 --> 00:47:53,416
Ladies, ladies. [chattering]

563
00:47:53,916 --> 00:47:56,916
Would you all please
step into my sitting room?

564
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,416
Ladies, ladies.

565
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:01,916
There's been a terrible robbery
at King's Cross station...

566
00:48:02,416 --> 00:48:05,000
at 1:00 this afternoon.

567
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Oh, have you a paper? May
I see the latest test score?

568
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,501
A robbery? At king's cross station?

569
00:48:12,501 --> 00:48:14,502
Yes, it must have
been terribly exciting.

570
00:48:14,502 --> 00:48:16,502
The paper says the
gangsters... what is the score?

571
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:20,002
Australia all out for 60,000. 1:00?

572
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:24,002
Yes. The papers say that the police
are not certain... three hundred and ten.

573
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:26,004
They're out for 310. [chuckling]

574
00:48:26,004 --> 00:48:29,004
They're not certain how the money
was brought from the station.

575
00:48:29,004 --> 00:48:33,004
Sixty thousand pounds, they say it is.

576
00:48:42,673 --> 00:48:44,756
[Chattering]

577
00:48:50,257 --> 00:48:53,257
Ladies, ladies, please. Do you mind?

578
00:48:53,257 --> 00:48:57,258
You'll step into the sitting room for a
few minutes. I'll be with you in a moment,

579
00:48:57,258 --> 00:49:01,258
but I've something of a very private
nature to say to these gentlemen.

580
00:49:01,258 --> 00:49:04,258
Constance, I can't
help it. I'm very sorry.

581
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:06,759
Hypatia, I was asking you to
step into the sitting room.

582
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:09,760
Oh, but I want to talk to major
Courtney. I can't help it, my dear.

583
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,760
Slip out, move the car into
the next row. All right.

584
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,260
Uh-uh.

585
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,262
Leave that here.

586
00:49:29,763 --> 00:49:34,264
Professor Marcus, I take it there's no
need for me to look at the newspaper.

587
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:36,764
Indeed, I thought not.

588
00:49:37,264 --> 00:49:40,265
I am shocked by this revelation.

589
00:49:40,265 --> 00:49:42,265
Shocked and appalled.

590
00:49:42,265 --> 00:49:44,765
And I must tell
you, all of you...

591
00:49:45,265 --> 00:49:48,765
where's Mr. Robinson gone? He'll,
uh... he'll be back in a moment.

592
00:49:48,765 --> 00:49:51,266
Oh. Now, look, missus,
we haven't got much time.

593
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:55,766
Louisa, you've only laid five places.

594
00:49:55,766 --> 00:49:57,767
Surely these gentlemen
are staying for tea.

595
00:49:57,767 --> 00:50:00,768
[All chattering, indistinct]

596
00:50:00,768 --> 00:50:04,268
They want to play
to us. No, I don't...

597
00:50:04,268 --> 00:50:08,768
oh, no. I'm sorry, but
we mustn't press them.

598
00:50:08,768 --> 00:50:10,768
Oh, let them play, Louisa.

599
00:50:10,768 --> 00:50:13,270
We can't press them, Lettice,
I'm sorry. They must hurry.

600
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:16,270
It'd be nice when we're
having our teas. Come, dear.

601
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,770
Yes, we will have them by and by.

602
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:21,270
Now, Amelia, if you don't mind.

603
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:23,271
They'll all come. I assure you.

604
00:50:23,271 --> 00:50:25,272
Yes, I do assure you.

605
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,772
You know, at the bottom of the
garden there's a most jolly little...

606
00:50:27,772 --> 00:50:31,772
Hypatia, didn't you hear me say
we'll just go in the sitting room?

607
00:50:32,273 --> 00:50:34,773
Yes, go in. I'm sure
they'll come by and by.

608
00:50:34,773 --> 00:50:37,773
[Hypatia] Louisa, I
think it's very unfair.

609
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,773
Well, there's nothing for it.

610
00:50:39,773 --> 00:50:42,190
You'll have to come in.

611
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:46,691
But please remember this, these are
some of my oldest and closest friends.

612
00:50:46,691 --> 00:50:50,692
They mustn't get the slightest
inkling of this disgraceful affair.

613
00:50:50,692 --> 00:50:54,943
Oh, really. This is the
most embarrassing position.

614
00:50:54,943 --> 00:50:57,943
Embarrassing and humiliating.

615
00:50:57,943 --> 00:51:01,693
Simply try for one hour
to behave like gentlemen.

616
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:04,028
All right, ma'am.

617
00:51:11,028 --> 00:51:13,028
No, please.

618
00:51:16,029 --> 00:51:20,030
Now we will go in.

619
00:51:55,534 --> 00:52:00,536
"Darling, I am growing old"

620
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:07,036
"silver threads among the gold"

621
00:52:08,537 --> 00:52:14,038
"shine upon my brow today"

622
00:52:15,538 --> 00:52:20,039
"life is fading fast away"

623
00:52:21,539 --> 00:52:26,539
but, my darling, you will be

624
00:52:26,539 --> 00:52:28,540
"will be"

625
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:33,540
"ever as young and fair to me"

626
00:52:38,541 --> 00:52:42,542
good-bye,
ladies. Good-bye.

627
00:52:45,542 --> 00:52:50,044
I thought they'd never go home.

628
00:52:50,044 --> 00:52:53,294
Mrs. Wilberforce, I don't
think you quite understand...

629
00:52:53,294 --> 00:52:56,294
the intricacies of this
particular situation.

630
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:58,794
Let me try to explain, Mrs. Wilberforce.

631
00:52:58,794 --> 00:53:02,795
You see, in this case, it would
do no good to take the money back.

632
00:53:02,795 --> 00:53:06,796
Strange as it may seem to you,
nobody wants the money back.

633
00:53:07,296 --> 00:53:09,796
Don't expect me to believe that.

634
00:53:09,796 --> 00:53:12,797
But it's true, Mrs. Wilberforce.

635
00:53:12,797 --> 00:53:16,547
You see, this particular
shipment of money was insured.

636
00:53:16,547 --> 00:53:21,548
So now the insurance company simply
pays to the factory 60,000 pounds,

637
00:53:21,548 --> 00:53:24,548
and then, in order to recover its money,

638
00:53:24,548 --> 00:53:30,049
it puts one farthing on all the
premiums, on all the policies...

639
00:53:30,049 --> 00:53:32,050
for all the next year.

640
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,050
You see?

641
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,550
So how much real harm
have we done anybody?

642
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,550
One farthing's worth, Mrs. Wilberforce.

643
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,550
You hadn't thought of
it like that, had you?

644
00:53:41,717 --> 00:53:44,719
Hey, you know what? I never
thought of it like that either.

645
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:47,552
Surely it isn't as simple as all that.

646
00:53:47,552 --> 00:53:49,552
I assure you, if we tried
to take the money back now,

647
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:52,052
it would simply confuse the whole issue.

648
00:53:52,052 --> 00:53:55,053
They wouldn't even take it
back. That's perfectly true.

649
00:53:57,054 --> 00:53:59,554
Oh, but it's quite ridiculous.

650
00:53:59,554 --> 00:54:01,554
Before you speak, Mrs. Wilberforce,

651
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:03,554
has it occurred to you to wonder...

652
00:54:03,554 --> 00:54:07,055
why five such men as ourselves
should have been driven to this?

653
00:54:07,055 --> 00:54:12,555
Why we should risk apprehension,
public humiliation, disgrace?

654
00:54:13,055 --> 00:54:14,556
There is not one amongst us...

655
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:18,556
who is not burdened with
responsibilities to others.

656
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:21,556
Major, tell her.

657
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:24,057
Tell her your own story.

658
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:29,058
No, no, I... oh, please,
Claude. Tell her.

659
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:34,058
Well, it's just that... well, at
this very moment, Mrs. Wilberforce,

660
00:54:34,058 --> 00:54:37,560
there is waiting an invalid, a
dear, sweet, little old lady...

661
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,060
not, may heaven bless
her, not unlike yourself...

662
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:43,810
waiting with patient
serenity, but with high hope...

663
00:54:43,810 --> 00:54:46,561
that she has nothing more to fear.

664
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,812
My mother.

665
00:54:52,312 --> 00:54:57,313
[Sniffles] each of them
could tell a similar story.

666
00:54:57,313 --> 00:54:59,813
I planned the robbery, Mrs. Wilberforce.

667
00:55:01,313 --> 00:55:03,313
I wanted to help them.

668
00:55:11,314 --> 00:55:17,315
No, I don't think, even
if what you say is true,

669
00:55:17,315 --> 00:55:20,316
I still don't think it can be said...

670
00:55:20,816 --> 00:55:23,816
to be enough
justification...

671
00:55:23,816 --> 00:55:26,316
Madam, how can you be so
heartless? You're a cruel woman.

672
00:55:26,316 --> 00:55:30,318
But to sit in judgment on your
fellow creatures. I'm sorry.

673
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:33,318
This is getting us nowhere.
We must do something.

674
00:55:33,318 --> 00:55:35,818
Quite right, Mr. Harvey,
we've got to tell her.

675
00:55:35,818 --> 00:55:38,068
Mrs. Wilberforce, I
wanted to spare you this,

676
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:41,069
but I'm afraid the
police are after you too.

677
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:44,570
That's right, you're as hot
as the rest of us, ma'am.

678
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,570
As hot?

679
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,570
[Major] if they pick her up, there's
no saying what they may do to her.

680
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:52,988
- Pick me up? Would you mind explaining...
- job was planned in her house.

681
00:55:52,988 --> 00:55:57,488
She carried the lolly for us. Yes,
I know I carried the lolly, but...

682
00:55:57,488 --> 00:55:59,488
but she was ignorant
of the plan, of course.

683
00:55:59,488 --> 00:56:01,989
Ignorance in the sight
of the law is no excuse.

684
00:56:02,072 --> 00:56:04,572
Even if we swear that she
didn't know what she was doing.

685
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:06,822
They'd never believe us. Yeah.

686
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:08,823
Who would believe anything we said?

687
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:11,824
Oh, but this is ridiculous.

688
00:56:11,824 --> 00:56:13,824
I know the superintendent.
I shall deny any knowledge.

689
00:56:14,324 --> 00:56:17,824
She'll never stand up to it, of course.

690
00:56:17,824 --> 00:56:21,324
The grilling, the rubber hoses. [professor
] the rest of her life sewing mail bags.

691
00:56:21,324 --> 00:56:23,326
Mail bags?

692
00:56:23,326 --> 00:56:27,076
And no one to look
after the parrots. Oh.

693
00:56:27,076 --> 00:56:29,576
We won't let them get
you, Mrs. Wilberforce.

694
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:32,577
Why not? What's she ever done for us?

695
00:56:32,577 --> 00:56:35,078
If they get us, I'll tell
them she planned the job.

696
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:38,328
I'll tell them she
planned the big one. Oh.

697
00:56:38,745 --> 00:56:43,246
The east castle street
job. [chuckling]

698
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:52,746
[Bell rings] oh. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

699
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:56,747
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

700
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,747
It's a bogey. A bogey. Oh, no.

701
00:56:59,747 --> 00:57:02,748
Look, out the back
way. Stay where you are.

702
00:57:02,748 --> 00:57:05,749
Don't answer it. We must
answer it. The light's on.

703
00:57:05,749 --> 00:57:07,749
When you were at the station with
the trunk, what did you say to them?

704
00:57:08,249 --> 00:57:10,249
Nothing. I've no idea. I don't remember.

705
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:12,249
Let's get out of here. Where do we go?

706
00:57:12,749 --> 00:57:15,751
No one's going anywhere. Mrs.
Wilberforce, listen to me.

707
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:18,251
Go to the door. Ask him what he wants.

708
00:57:18,751 --> 00:57:21,751
Say you're going to bed early. Yes.

709
00:57:23,251 --> 00:57:27,252
If he asks about me, say I left
this afternoon for Manchester.

710
00:57:27,252 --> 00:57:29,253
Manchester.

711
00:57:29,253 --> 00:57:33,753
Don't let him in, you understand? No.

712
00:57:33,753 --> 00:57:37,754
He can't come in without a search
warrant. Not without a search warrant.

713
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:42,837
You don't want to rot in stir the rest of
your life. Be sensible. Stay buttoned up.

714
00:57:43,337 --> 00:57:45,004
Buttoned up? [bell rings]

715
00:57:50,255 --> 00:57:53,255
Yes? [clatters]

716
00:57:53,338 --> 00:57:56,339
Uh, good evening, Mrs.
Wilberforce. What do you want?

717
00:57:56,840 --> 00:58:01,840
It's sergeant McDonald. Yes, I
know who it is. What do you want?

718
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:04,840
The superintendent asked me
to call in on the way back.

719
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,842
What about? What's the matter?
Oh, it's nothing, ma'am.

720
00:58:07,842 --> 00:58:11,842
Just to let you know, we've
sorted out all that rumpus.

721
00:58:11,842 --> 00:58:14,342
- You'll not be wanted.
- I won't be wanted?

722
00:58:14,342 --> 00:58:18,343
- I won't come in. I'm all
wet. - Y-you can't come in!

723
00:58:18,343 --> 00:58:21,844
I'm going to bed early. Professor
Marcus left this afternoon.

724
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:26,844
You can't come in without a search
warrant. [sergeant] a search warrant?

725
00:58:27,344 --> 00:58:30,512
What would I be wanting
with a search warrant?

726
00:58:30,512 --> 00:58:34,512
You haven't got a
search warrant, have you?

727
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:37,512
No, ma'am. Then good night.

728
00:58:48,264 --> 00:58:52,765
He...
c-coming.

729
00:58:52,765 --> 00:58:57,765
Oh, dear. Don't let him in. Whatever
he says, just tell him to buzz off.

730
00:59:01,267 --> 00:59:05,767
- You're quite sure you're all right,
Mrs. Wilber... - of course I'm all right.

731
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:08,767
Now, will you please buzz off?

732
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:17,352
He's going off. He's going
away. Was that all right?

733
00:59:17,352 --> 00:59:21,353
Fine. Give him time to move on.
Now, now, Mrs. Wilberforce. In here.

734
00:59:21,353 --> 00:59:24,520
- The cases.
- Let me give you a piece of advice.

735
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,020
Don't go near a police station
again, any police station.

736
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:35,521
And don't speak to a police constable
again, under any circumstances.

737
00:59:35,521 --> 00:59:40,022
Just lie low and stay buttoned up, you
understand? Don't talk to anybody about anything.

738
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:45,023
Surely you don't intend to take the
money. Surely we must send back the money.

739
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:50,023
I agree that we must stay
low and... and buttoned up.

740
00:59:50,023 --> 00:59:55,025
It wouldn't be right to keep the
money. Now, listen with both ears.

741
00:59:55,525 --> 00:59:58,025
We've had about all we're
going to take from you.

742
00:59:58,025 --> 01:00:03,525
You don't seem to realize what
this situation means. No. No.

743
01:00:03,525 --> 01:00:06,527
I was quite wrong.
Doesn't she understand?

744
01:00:07,027 --> 01:00:11,027
No, it isn't any good.
I know what we must do.

745
01:00:11,527 --> 01:00:16,028
I know I carried the lolly
for you, but even if they do...

746
01:00:16,028 --> 01:00:19,028
make me sew mail bags,

747
01:00:19,028 --> 01:00:23,528
I would rather... rather
go to the police station...

748
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:27,529
and give myself up.

749
01:00:38,614 --> 01:00:41,114
[Thunderclap]

750
01:00:41,114 --> 01:00:44,114
[Train whistle blowing]

751
01:00:44,114 --> 01:00:48,616
It ought to look like an accident.

752
01:00:48,616 --> 01:00:52,116
How about suicide? What do you mean?

753
01:00:52,116 --> 01:00:55,616
Well, get her to write a note, you
know. "I just couldn't stand it no more.

754
01:00:56,116 --> 01:00:59,618
Signed, Mrs. Wilberforce." and then
somebody goes down and hangs her.

755
01:00:59,618 --> 01:01:02,618
Hmm? Very funny.

756
01:01:06,618 --> 01:01:09,619
You got a better idea?

757
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:14,619
Who's gonna do it?

758
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:16,619
I couldn't.

759
01:01:16,619 --> 01:01:19,620
I should be terrified of... muffing it.

760
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,120
I mean to
say... well.

761
01:01:26,121 --> 01:01:30,122
It ought to be someone
experienced in...

762
01:01:32,122 --> 01:01:35,122
why look at me?
Why should I...

763
01:01:35,622 --> 01:01:38,122
we know how you feel about
her. You've told us so often...

764
01:01:38,122 --> 01:01:40,624
that you hate little old ladies.

765
01:01:40,624 --> 01:01:44,124
And why not you? You are the
one who masterminded this mess.

766
01:01:44,624 --> 01:01:47,624
I... I'm not...
[knocking]

767
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:51,625
Professor, if we're going to the
police station, we ought to go now. Hmm?

768
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:55,126
Well, we'd sooner not go
now, ma'am, not in this rain.

769
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:58,126
Uh, Mr. Lawson here's got a bad cold.

770
01:01:58,126 --> 01:02:01,627
Oh, very well. As
soon as the rain stops.

771
01:02:01,627 --> 01:02:05,127
I think, meanwhile, I had
better lock these away...

772
01:02:05,127 --> 01:02:08,127
out of temptation.

773
01:02:18,128 --> 01:02:20,129
Thank you.

774
01:02:38,632 --> 01:02:41,632
[Train chugging, distant]

775
01:03:56,227 --> 01:04:01,228
No, no. I... I won't. I
can't. Come, now, major.

776
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:04,228
Enough of that.

777
01:04:04,228 --> 01:04:06,729
No, no, no. I can't.

778
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:17,732
All right, Louis.

779
01:04:17,732 --> 01:04:19,732
I lost.

780
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:22,732
I'll do it.

781
01:04:41,235 --> 01:04:44,735
No, no. Not down there.
Not in her own room.

782
01:04:44,735 --> 01:04:48,235
[Clears throat] not
in front of the parrots.

783
01:04:48,235 --> 01:04:51,236
Send her up here afterwards.

784
01:05:04,821 --> 01:05:07,321
Ah, good. Mrs. Wilberforce,

785
01:05:07,821 --> 01:05:11,323
major Courtney would like to speak
to you privately, if you don't mind.

786
01:05:11,323 --> 01:05:15,823
Upstairs. Major Courtney? But what
can he... just a moment, please.

787
01:05:20,823 --> 01:05:24,825
If you wouldn't mind just going
upstairs, I think you'll find...

788
01:05:24,825 --> 01:05:28,325
he has the solution to all our problems.

789
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:31,325
It won't take a minute.

790
01:05:40,076 --> 01:05:41,576
[Knock on door]

791
01:05:47,077 --> 01:05:49,577
[Knocking continues]

792
01:05:50,077 --> 01:05:52,578
Yes, major Courtney?

793
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:57,079
[Train whistle blows, distant]

794
01:05:59,579 --> 01:06:02,579
She had to go. She asked for it.

795
01:06:02,579 --> 01:06:06,081
She's probably been asking
for it all her life. Yeah.

796
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:09,081
Look what she done to that barrow
boy and the cabby and the junk man.

797
01:06:09,581 --> 01:06:11,581
All of 'em out of
business in ten minutes.

798
01:06:12,081 --> 01:06:16,082
I promise you, Mrs. Wilberforce, they've no
intention of letting you take them to the police.

799
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:19,083
But professor Marcus
said... he was lying.

800
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:24,583
At this very moment, they believe me to
be... to be bargaining for your silence.

801
01:06:25,084 --> 01:06:27,584
These men are criminals,

802
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:31,584
and I, too, am one of them.

803
01:06:31,584 --> 01:06:35,084
All the same, I don't like it.

804
01:06:35,084 --> 01:06:39,085
Shut up, will ya? Shut up!
Please, please. [squawks]

805
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:42,085
Let us try to be patient.

806
01:06:57,089 --> 01:07:00,589
All I ask you is to
believe me when I say, well,

807
01:07:00,589 --> 01:07:04,089
a spark of decency remains.

808
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:07,090
I was moved, madam, by your appeal.

809
01:07:07,590 --> 01:07:11,591
I shall go to the police,
even if the others do not.

810
01:07:11,591 --> 01:07:14,591
But I... I
need your help.

811
01:07:14,591 --> 01:07:18,092
Stay here. Guard the money.

812
01:07:18,092 --> 01:07:22,842
Give me time to reach
the officers of the law...

813
01:07:23,342 --> 01:07:25,342
and bring them back with me.

814
01:07:25,842 --> 01:07:28,843
- Uh, you do trust me,
don't you? - Yes, but, uh...

815
01:07:31,843 --> 01:07:34,343
[creaking]

816
01:07:52,764 --> 01:07:55,264
[Creaking continues]

817
01:08:06,266 --> 01:08:10,099
Major. Major?

818
01:08:10,099 --> 01:08:14,100
What's taking him so long?
What's taking him so...

819
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:18,600
Be quiet. I am still
talking to major Courtney.

820
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:21,101
Wait downstairs.

821
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:27,601
He's gone. The major's
gone. He's crossed us.

822
01:08:28,101 --> 01:08:30,102
Mrs. Wilberforce.

823
01:08:31,853 --> 01:08:34,853
It's gone. The lolly's gone!

824
01:08:38,353 --> 01:08:41,853
He didn't go the back way.
He's done it. He's took the lot!

825
01:08:41,853 --> 01:08:45,855
I've nothing to say! I'm
going to stay buttoned up.

826
01:08:49,772 --> 01:08:52,688
[Departing footsteps]

827
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:05,691
Louis! On the roof!

828
01:09:11,191 --> 01:09:14,192
On the roof, quickly! Cover the back!

829
01:09:33,944 --> 01:09:36,946
Now, now, Louis. Well,
don't get excited.

830
01:09:40,446 --> 01:09:42,446
[Grunts]

831
01:09:42,446 --> 01:09:44,946
Oh, my word!

832
01:09:52,948 --> 01:09:56,949
Professor, may I ask you... no, thank
you, Mrs. Wilberforce. No tea. Thank you.

833
01:09:58,949 --> 01:10:03,949
What are you all doing? Professor!
Where did you get that cello case?

834
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:07,950
I'll have that, Mr. Robinson. I
gave Mrs. Wilberforce our word...

835
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:10,450
that no attempt would be
made to remove the money.

836
01:10:10,450 --> 01:10:12,950
Thank you. Thank you!

837
01:10:16,951 --> 01:10:20,452
Be sensible, old man. You
don't think I'd walk out on you?

838
01:10:20,452 --> 01:10:23,452
The idea is preposterous.

839
01:10:23,952 --> 01:10:26,952
[Chuckles nervously] you
know me better than that.

840
01:10:26,952 --> 01:10:29,954
Louis! Oh, no. Louis, old chap. Please.

841
01:10:30,454 --> 01:10:35,454
No. Don't. No. Louis,
Louis! No. Louis, Louis!

842
01:10:35,454 --> 01:10:40,955
It won't do any harm to tell you now.
Major Courtney has gone for the police.

843
01:10:41,456 --> 01:10:44,456
They'll be here shortly. Oh,
whatever's that? [clunking]

844
01:10:44,956 --> 01:10:47,956
I expect something fell off the
roof. Maybe a chimney pot. The roof!

845
01:10:47,956 --> 01:10:49,957
A chimney pot. See who it is, Harry.

846
01:10:55,374 --> 01:10:58,874
We'll talk about this
when the police get here.

847
01:10:58,874 --> 01:11:03,875
It's long past my bedtime, and
I've had a most exhausting day.

848
01:11:11,877 --> 01:11:16,335
Well, where is he? Where is
the major? Is he up there still?

849
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:18,877
No, no. He, uh...
he come down.

850
01:11:18,877 --> 01:11:23,879
- Well, bring him here.
- He come down with the chimney pot.

851
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,879
The chimney... [
snickers] is he hurt?

852
01:11:26,879 --> 01:11:29,879
I shouldn't think he felt a thing.

853
01:11:49,465 --> 01:11:51,965
I just decided something.

854
01:11:51,965 --> 01:11:55,966
I decided I changed my
mind. I ain't gonna do it.

855
01:11:56,383 --> 01:11:58,383
What? What are you saying? Why not?

856
01:11:58,383 --> 01:12:00,884
You're in this as much as
we are. It's too late now,

857
01:12:01,384 --> 01:12:03,885
one round, to have a mind to change.

858
01:12:04,385 --> 01:12:08,385
- This is a hanging matter, one round.
- Why is it a hanging matter...

859
01:12:08,385 --> 01:12:12,885
for doing the major any more than
it is for doing Mrs. Lopsided, eh?

860
01:12:13,385 --> 01:12:15,887
- That's not the point.
- Come on.

861
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:19,887
Listen, I drew the match last time,
didn't I? I took my chances, didn't I?

862
01:12:19,887 --> 01:12:23,387
I sat there when we thought
the major was doing it, okay?

863
01:12:23,887 --> 01:12:27,389
I've had enough. If we were gonna do it,
we should have done it and got it over with.

864
01:12:27,389 --> 01:12:30,847
Ahh, you're being
stupid. Okay, I'm stupid,

865
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:35,390
but nobody touches
Mrs. Lopsided, nobody.

866
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:39,890
I see.

867
01:12:43,348 --> 01:12:46,224
- Maybe one round is right.
- What?

868
01:12:46,724 --> 01:12:49,224
As one round says,

869
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:53,224
the first thing to do is
to lose the poor old major.

870
01:12:53,224 --> 01:12:55,767
There's a wheelbarrow out there.
Would you mind fetching it, please?

871
01:12:55,767 --> 01:12:58,726
What for? The major
has a train to catch.

872
01:12:58,726 --> 01:13:01,726
[Train whistle blowing, distant]

873
01:13:03,643 --> 01:13:06,143
[Sniffs loudly]

874
01:13:06,143 --> 01:13:10,645
[Whispering] Harry and Louis are
desperate men. We must be careful.

875
01:13:15,895 --> 01:13:18,896
Let's get this clear. No one is
running out now. That goose head is...

876
01:13:18,896 --> 01:13:22,897
[whispering]
Unreliable... and dangerous.

877
01:13:22,897 --> 01:13:27,897
I had to sweeten him. That
leaves the three of us.

878
01:13:32,398 --> 01:13:34,356
All right.

879
01:13:43,149 --> 01:13:45,149
[Chuckles]

880
01:13:52,609 --> 01:13:54,151
[Gulps]

881
01:13:59,151 --> 01:14:02,153
[Train passes by]

882
01:14:23,156 --> 01:14:26,656
Stop the clowning, will ya?

883
01:14:26,656 --> 01:14:30,114
Come on. All right, Harry.
I'll give one round a hand.

884
01:14:30,614 --> 01:14:34,157
You stay with Louis.

885
01:14:56,328 --> 01:14:59,328
[Grunts, imitates gunfire]

886
01:15:01,869 --> 01:15:04,329
Too noisy, eh?

887
01:15:04,329 --> 01:15:08,330
No, no, no, no. No, I can
manage all right. Thank you.

888
01:15:11,330 --> 01:15:13,872
Yeah. [growls]

889
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:32,499
Hello, madam. We're in a tough spot.

890
01:15:32,499 --> 01:15:36,000
Don't shout
out or any...

891
01:16:15,505 --> 01:16:17,005
[thud]

892
01:16:29,008 --> 01:16:32,008
[Train whistle blows]

893
01:16:49,345 --> 01:16:52,846
I think, one round, you'd better
fetch the car. Here is the key.

894
01:16:53,346 --> 01:16:55,846
There's no need to go through the house.

895
01:16:56,346 --> 01:17:00,347
Hey, professor. You wouldn't be trying
to get me out of the way, would you?

896
01:17:00,347 --> 01:17:04,347
[Chuckles] don't be stupid,
one round. Don't call me that.

897
01:17:04,347 --> 01:17:08,847
Just don't call me stupid.
Just tell me what's going on!

898
01:17:09,347 --> 01:17:11,848
Hey! Hey, what are they doin' in there?

899
01:17:17,264 --> 01:17:20,765
[Other door opening,
footsteps approaching]

900
01:17:21,266 --> 01:17:24,766
No, no. It wasn't me. You
done her! You done her! You...

901
01:17:25,266 --> 01:17:28,766
- no, look! It was Harry! He's got
the money. He's gone! - Why, you...

902
01:17:41,268 --> 01:17:43,769
[yelps]

903
01:17:47,854 --> 01:17:50,520
[Whimpers]

904
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:55,605
[Gasping]

905
01:18:02,105 --> 01:18:05,106
You done her!
No, I never...

906
01:18:12,107 --> 01:18:15,149
Aah! You done her!

907
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:18,608
No, I never! Where's your
sense of humor, one round?

908
01:18:18,608 --> 01:18:20,608
[Plank thuds]

909
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:30,526
[Squawking] oh, dear,
oh, dear, oh, dear!

910
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:38,028
I said nobody was to do her!

911
01:18:40,528 --> 01:18:45,362
I said... I said... I said nobody
was to do Mrs. Lopsided! Mr. Harvey!

912
01:18:45,362 --> 01:18:47,904
Stop that!

913
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:54,863
What are you doing? And who
is Mrs. Lopsided, may I ask?

914
01:18:54,863 --> 01:18:59,405
Where's Mr.
Robinson? He's...

915
01:18:59,905 --> 01:19:02,864
he's... he's
outside.

916
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:06,657
Somebody took the key.
The cello case has gone.

917
01:19:06,657 --> 01:19:09,532
It's, uh, out there too.

918
01:19:10,032 --> 01:19:12,616
Well, bring it in.

919
01:19:14,116 --> 01:19:16,616
I fell asleep.

920
01:19:16,616 --> 01:19:20,618
Somebody took the key out of my pocket.

921
01:19:20,618 --> 01:19:24,118
I'm very angry. As you
have every right to be.

922
01:19:24,118 --> 01:19:29,619
It's disgraceful, Mrs. Wilberforce.
Shameful. Mr. Robinson will answer for it.

923
01:19:35,286 --> 01:19:38,787
I'll take that, thank you.

924
01:19:38,787 --> 01:19:42,287
Professor Marcus, this is
another black mark against you.

925
01:19:42,287 --> 01:19:45,246
I shall certainly tell the police.

926
01:19:48,287 --> 01:19:53,788
- What happened?
- Why, uh, I thought they done her in.

927
01:19:53,788 --> 01:19:56,247
I thought Harry done her.

928
01:19:56,247 --> 01:19:58,789
So?

929
01:19:58,789 --> 01:20:01,790
So all right. I made a mistake.

930
01:20:06,124 --> 01:20:09,040
- Put him in the barrow.
- No.

931
01:20:10,792 --> 01:20:13,792
What? What are you saying?

932
01:20:13,792 --> 01:20:17,792
You lose Harry. I'm staying with mum.

933
01:20:22,543 --> 01:20:26,044
[Yawns] have you any idea...

934
01:20:26,044 --> 01:20:29,003
what's making those
officers so long in coming?

935
01:20:29,378 --> 01:20:34,879
All right. But afterwards, before we
do her, we have to take care of him.

936
01:20:34,879 --> 01:20:39,420
What my husband would have said
about all this if he were alive!

937
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:44,380
Captain Wilberforce was
in the mercantile marines.

938
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:49,380
He went down with his
ship, oh, 29 years ago...

939
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:52,923
in a typhoon in the china sea.

940
01:20:52,923 --> 01:20:56,882
These three little
creatures were with him.

941
01:20:56,882 --> 01:21:00,882
He kept them in his cabin.
Captain Wilberforce...

942
01:21:00,882 --> 01:21:04,925
made sure they were
safely on the last boat.

943
01:21:04,925 --> 01:21:10,384
But he himself remained at
the salute on the bridge.

944
01:21:12,384 --> 01:21:14,343
Look, uh, I make a proposition to you.

945
01:21:14,718 --> 01:21:17,719
I'll take care of him
if you take care of her.

946
01:21:18,136 --> 01:21:22,969
- That's a straight 50-50
split, huh? - No, no.

947
01:21:23,469 --> 01:21:27,470
I would rather it was the other
way about. Let me have one round.

948
01:21:27,887 --> 01:21:30,970
You take care of Mrs. "w." wait.

949
01:21:37,763 --> 01:21:39,721
[Thud]

950
01:21:45,222 --> 01:21:48,223
Guess who's next.

951
01:21:53,223 --> 01:21:56,225
Wait a minute, one round.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

952
01:21:56,225 --> 01:21:59,725
Look. We can make a deal. You'll
never get away by yourself.

953
01:21:59,725 --> 01:22:03,267
I'll help you. Do him. He's
the one who got you into this.

954
01:22:03,267 --> 01:22:06,225
Do him. I heard ya, both of ya.

955
01:22:06,225 --> 01:22:10,727
I been standing here all the time. Sure,
you two were gonna put me on the train.

956
01:22:11,227 --> 01:22:14,769
And all the time you been
telling me how stupid I am.

957
01:22:14,769 --> 01:22:18,728
Okay. So who looks stupid now, eh?

958
01:22:18,728 --> 01:22:21,228
[Train approaching]

959
01:22:26,395 --> 01:22:29,854
[Train whistle screeching]

960
01:22:38,398 --> 01:22:41,356
The safety catch was on.

961
01:22:59,025 --> 01:23:02,402
[Train whistle blows] it
was a good plan, you know.

962
01:23:02,402 --> 01:23:06,860
I've worked on so many plans, and they
were all good, but this was the best.

963
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:09,902
Except for the human element.

964
01:23:09,902 --> 01:23:13,903
All good plans include the human
element, but then, I admit you were right.

965
01:23:13,903 --> 01:23:18,361
No really good plan could
include Mrs. Wilberforce,

966
01:23:18,861 --> 01:23:22,404
unless, of course, we had more men.

967
01:23:22,404 --> 01:23:26,404
There were only five of
us.???? [humming quintet]

968
01:23:26,404 --> 01:23:30,405
What's the matter? What's the matter
with you? Take it easy, will you?

969
01:23:30,405 --> 01:23:33,406
But it would take 20 or 30 or
40, perhaps, to deal with her,

970
01:23:33,406 --> 01:23:36,406
because we'll never be
able to kill her, Louis.

971
01:23:36,406 --> 01:23:41,908
- She'll always be with us, forever and ever and ever.
- [Train approaching]

972
01:23:41,908 --> 01:23:45,908
And there's nothing we
can do. You're crazy!

973
01:23:45,908 --> 01:23:49,908
You mustn't say things like
that, Louis, because I told you...

974
01:23:49,908 --> 01:23:52,909
you mustn't make me angry!

975
01:24:27,664 --> 01:24:29,664
[Gunfire]

976
01:24:42,166 --> 01:24:44,666
[Echoing] over here, Louis.

977
01:24:57,919 --> 01:25:00,085
[Gunfire]

978
01:25:03,544 --> 01:25:07,086
[Professor, voice echoing]
Seven gone, Louis. One more to go.

979
01:25:26,963 --> 01:25:29,049
[Train passing]

980
01:25:48,592 --> 01:25:50,593
[Professor] Louis.

981
01:25:53,552 --> 01:25:56,093
[Singsong] Louis.

982
01:26:14,096 --> 01:26:16,596
Oh-hoo!

983
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:21,098
[Metal scraping] what are you doing?

984
01:26:21,098 --> 01:26:24,098
I won't keep you, Louis.

985
01:26:24,098 --> 01:26:29,182
- There'll be another train soon.
- [Train approaching]

986
01:26:29,182 --> 01:26:32,599
[Metal screeching]

987
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:40,100
[Bar clanks to ground]

988
01:26:52,352 --> 01:26:55,477
[Metal crunching, thud]

989
01:27:19,856 --> 01:27:22,356
[Gears grinding]

990
01:27:24,357 --> 01:27:26,858
[Whistle toots]

991
01:27:36,943 --> 01:27:40,943
But I do hope you'll believe me.
It's true I carried the lolly,

992
01:27:40,943 --> 01:27:44,484
but I wasn't really one of the gang.

993
01:27:44,484 --> 01:27:47,944
I admit the caper was
planned in my house,

994
01:27:47,944 --> 01:27:50,444
but it wasn't I who planned it.

995
01:27:50,444 --> 01:27:53,945
And I did not plan or
have anything to do...

996
01:27:54,445 --> 01:27:56,987
with the east castle street job.

997
01:27:56,987 --> 01:28:01,946
- Didn't you, ma'am?
- I don't even know where east castle street is.

998
01:28:02,946 --> 01:28:05,946
Oh, good morning, superintendent.

999
01:28:05,946 --> 01:28:08,448
I was just telling the sergeant...
morning. If you'll forgive me,

1000
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,948
I'm rather late for an
important conference.

1001
01:28:10,948 --> 01:28:14,448
I'm sure sergeant Harris'll look after
you all right. Oh, but, superintendent,

1002
01:28:14,448 --> 01:28:17,449
I did want to ask your
advice about some things...

1003
01:28:17,449 --> 01:28:21,991
Wat happened to the rest of the gang,
ma'am? Well, that's the funny thing.

1004
01:28:22,491 --> 01:28:25,950
They all disappeared during the night.

1005
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:29,951
But I have all the lolly... oh, I
beg your pardon. I'm so confused.

1006
01:28:29,951 --> 01:28:33,992
I have all the money back at the
house. You see, I took charge of it.

1007
01:28:33,992 --> 01:28:37,451
And they were so alarmed,
they simply disappeared.

1008
01:28:37,451 --> 01:28:40,452
They didn't have a spaceship, did they?

1009
01:28:40,452 --> 01:28:44,952
You're not suggesting
I imagined all this?

1010
01:28:44,952 --> 01:28:48,954
- No, no, ma'am.
- Really, sergeant, you must think my mind is wandering.

1011
01:28:48,954 --> 01:28:52,954
No, no, Mrs. Wilberforce.
It's just that, uh, well,

1012
01:28:52,954 --> 01:28:56,454
for various reasons, we
want you to oblige us...

1013
01:28:56,454 --> 01:28:58,995
by forgetting all about the matter.

1014
01:28:58,995 --> 01:29:02,456
And don't mention it to anyone. Oh!

1015
01:29:02,456 --> 01:29:06,456
Oh, I won't mention it, of course.
But you'll send someone for the money?

1016
01:29:06,956 --> 01:29:11,998
Oh, I think as far as we're concerned,
ma'am, why don't you just keep the money?

1017
01:29:13,958 --> 01:29:18,958
Keep the money?
I can't believe...

1018
01:29:18,958 --> 01:29:22,959
oh, I know it's only a farthing
on everybody's policies, but, uh...

1019
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:29,459
they said you wouldn't
want the money back,

1020
01:29:29,459 --> 01:29:32,460
that it would only confuse the issue.

1021
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:35,460
That's right, Mrs. Wilberforce.
Now, if you don't mind,

1022
01:29:35,460 --> 01:29:38,001
I've got some very pressing
business to attend to.

1023
01:29:38,001 --> 01:29:40,961
Oh, yes, of course. Good morning.

1024
01:29:43,253 --> 01:29:48,712
[Sergeant] Mrs. Wilberforce, wait!

1025
01:29:48,712 --> 01:29:51,712
Just a moment!

1026
01:29:51,712 --> 01:29:55,755
- You forgot it, ma'am.
- Oh. No, I don't think I want it.

1027
01:29:55,755 --> 01:29:59,214
I never liked it. Now I
can buy a dozen new ones.

1028
01:29:59,214 --> 01:30:02,714
Oh, uh, good morning, sergeant.

1029
01:30:06,716 --> 01:30:09,716
Oh. They're very good, very good.

1030
01:30:10,216 --> 01:30:14,217
Turned out nice, hasn't it? Yes, it has.

1031
01:30:14,717 --> 01:30:18,217
Oh, hey, look! Lady!

1032
01:30:18,717 --> 01:30:20,258
Look!
