1
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,018
¶ I love your funny face

2
00:00:37,153 --> 00:00:41,020
¶ Your sunny, funny face

3
00:00:41,823 --> 00:00:44,030
¶ For you're a cutie

4
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:46,235
¶ With more than beauty

5
00:00:46,578 --> 00:00:49,033
¶ You've got a lot of

6
00:00:49,163 --> 00:00:51,120
¶ Personality-N-T

7
00:00:51,248 --> 00:00:55,542
¶ You fill the air with smiles

8
00:00:56,086 --> 00:01:00,748
¶ For miles and miles and miles

9
00:01:00,882 --> 00:01:03,171
¶ Though you're no Mona Lisa

10
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:05,922
¶ For worlds I'd not replace

11
00:01:06,053 --> 00:01:09,754
¶ Your sunny, funny face

12
00:01:11,683 --> 00:01:19,773
¶ You've made my life so glamorous

13
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:27,231
¶ You can't blame me
for feeling amorous

14
00:01:27,364 --> 00:01:32,109
¶ Oh, 's wonderful

15
00:01:32,619 --> 00:01:37,530
¶ 'S marvellous

16
00:02:05,316 --> 00:02:07,355
Good morning, Miss Prescott.

17
00:02:09,945 --> 00:02:11,937
Good morning, Miss Prescott.

18
00:02:20,746 --> 00:02:22,988
Now hear this.

19
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:43,554
I simply cannot release this issue
the way it is.

20
00:02:43,683 --> 00:02:48,345
In the 60 years of Quality
magazine, this hits rock bottom.

21
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,263
If I let this go through, I will have
failed the American woman.

22
00:02:52,399 --> 00:02:54,308
No, Miss Prescott,
don't say that.

23
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:57,562
The great American woman,
who stands out there naked,

24
00:02:57,696 --> 00:03:00,815
waiting for me
to tell her what to wear.

25
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:03,071
It doesn't speak.

26
00:03:03,201 --> 00:03:06,700
And if it won't speak to me,
it won't speak to anyone.

27
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:11,038
A magazine
must be like a human being.

28
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,871
If it comes into the home
it must contribute.

29
00:03:14,002 --> 00:03:17,121
It just can't lie around.

30
00:03:17,255 --> 00:03:19,461
A magazine must have...

31
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:23,384
..blood and brains and pizzazz.

32
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,004
This is just paper.

33
00:03:25,137 --> 00:03:28,552
If I send paper to the American
woman, I will have let her down.

34
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:30,923
No, Miss Prescott,
you mustn't say that.

35
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:33,098
Yes. D for down.

36
00:03:33,227 --> 00:03:34,721
D for dreary.

37
00:03:34,854 --> 00:03:39,232
D for dull and for depressing,

38
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:41,185
dismal and deadly!

39
00:03:44,697 --> 00:03:47,448
Ahh! Here it is.

40
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:50,575
Here is our theme.
Here is our answer. Pink.

41
00:03:57,208 --> 00:04:00,826
Girls, girls, girls, girls.
Take this to all the designers.

42
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:03,250
I want dresses made up in this pink.

43
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,254
Babs, take this to Kaiser Delmont.

44
00:04:05,382 --> 00:04:07,707
I want shoes and stockings
in this colour.

45
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:10,416
Laura, everything goes pink!

46
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,720
I want the whole issue pink.
I want the whole country pink!

47
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:18,059
Lettie, take an editorial.
"To the women of America..."

48
00:04:18,185 --> 00:04:20,854
No, make it
"To the women everywhere."

49
00:04:21,188 --> 00:04:22,765
Banish the black,

50
00:04:22,898 --> 00:04:24,440
burn the blue,

51
00:04:24,566 --> 00:04:26,642
and bury the beige.

52
00:04:26,776 --> 00:04:28,650
From now on, girls...

53
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:34,189
¶ Think pink! Think pink
when you shop for summer clothes

54
00:04:34,325 --> 00:04:38,369
¶ Think pink! Think pink
if you want that quelque chose

55
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:40,286
¶ Red is dead, blue is through

56
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,205
¶ Green's obscene, brown's taboo

57
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:46,246
¶ And there is not the slightest
excuse for plum, or puce

58
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:47,919
¶ Or chartreuse

59
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,710
¶ Think pink!
Forget that Dior says black and rust

60
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,540
¶ Think pink! Who cares
if the new look has no bust?

61
00:04:55,677 --> 00:04:57,669
¶ I wouldn't presume to tell a woman

62
00:04:57,804 --> 00:04:59,262
¶ What a woman ought to think

63
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:01,879
¶ But tell her if she's gotta think,
think pink

64
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:04,589
¶ For bags, pink for shoes

65
00:05:04,727 --> 00:05:07,264
¶ Razzle, dazzle and spread the news

66
00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:11,063
¶ And pink's for the lady
with joie de vivre

67
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,485
¶ Pink's for all the family

68
00:05:15,945 --> 00:05:18,815
¶ Try pink shampoo

69
00:05:19,198 --> 00:05:21,274
¶ Pink toothpaste too

70
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:24,316
¶ Play in pink, all day in pink

71
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:27,240
¶ Play day in pink

72
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:30,990
¶ Drive in pink

73
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,156
¶ Come alive in pink

74
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:35,128
¶ Hang five in pink

75
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:42,425
¶ Go out dancing
but just remember one thing

76
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:44,296
¶ You can get a little wink

77
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,138
¶ If you got a little pink

78
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:49,965
¶ In your swing

79
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:57,937
¶ Think pink! Think pink,
it's the latest word, you know

80
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,979
¶ Think pink! Think pink,
and you're Michelangelo

81
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,450
¶ Feels so gay, feels so bright

82
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,945
¶ Makes your day, makes your night

83
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,946
¶ Pink is now the colour to which
you gotta switch

84
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,707
¶ To which you gotta switch

85
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,033
¶ Every stitch

86
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:20,829
¶ Every stitch you switch

87
00:06:20,962 --> 00:06:25,588
¶ Think pink! Think pink
on the long, long road ahead

88
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,127
¶ On the road

89
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:31,968
¶ Think pink! Think pink,
and the world is rosy red

90
00:06:32,097 --> 00:06:33,591
¶ Everything's rosy

91
00:06:33,724 --> 00:06:36,641
¶ Everything on the great horizon

92
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:39,010
¶ Everything that you can think

93
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,855
¶ And that includes the kitchen sink

94
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,858
¶ Think pink

95
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,644
¶ Think pink, think pink

96
00:06:46,777 --> 00:06:48,236
¶ Think pink, think pink

97
00:06:48,362 --> 00:06:51,031
¶ Think pink, think pink,
think pink!

98
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:55,701
Maggie?

99
00:06:56,286 --> 00:06:58,159
Dovitch. I want to see you.

100
00:06:58,287 --> 00:07:01,371
Girls, back to work.
Gentlemen, that will do.

101
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:04,120
The railroad
is going to paint a whole train pink

102
00:07:04,251 --> 00:07:05,745
and send it on a tour.

103
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:08,582
TWA will let me know
if we can have a pink plane.

104
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:12,047
I haven't seen a woman in two weeks
in anything but pink.

105
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:15,508
- What about you?
- Me? I wouldn't be caught dead.

106
00:07:15,636 --> 00:07:19,468
Dovitch, I can't wait to tell you
about my feature for the next issue.

107
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,180
It's my newest project.
When you hear it, you will drop.

108
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,551
- Now what?
- Just you listen.

109
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:28,356
Dick Avery
started working on the pictures.

110
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,972
He's more excited about it
than any of us.

111
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:35,188
Here it is. Clothes for the woman
who isn't interested in clothes.

112
00:07:35,738 --> 00:07:39,153
Marion, give me a long look.

113
00:07:39,282 --> 00:07:40,362
Longer.

114
00:07:40,826 --> 00:07:43,115
Longer.

115
00:07:43,245 --> 00:07:47,243
Steve, tip that back light down
a bit, will you? OK.

116
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:53,419
Hold it, boys.
Beethoven isn't working. Try Brahms.

117
00:07:53,546 --> 00:07:57,246
Look, Marion,
I'd like to try it again.

118
00:07:57,383 --> 00:08:00,004
This time,
let's see if we can't get with it.

119
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:03,006
Keep in mind
that you're a woman who thinks.

120
00:08:03,138 --> 00:08:06,008
That is a piece of sculpture
by ltsabuchi.

121
00:08:06,141 --> 00:08:11,098
Look at it as if you understand it.
As if it understands you. See?

122
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,317
No, that's not the way we look
when we're thinking of Itsabuchi.

123
00:08:18,443 --> 00:08:21,397
React to it. Just... say it.

124
00:08:22,822 --> 00:08:25,906
Itsabuchi, hmm?

125
00:08:26,993 --> 00:08:31,072
You haven't quite got it.
Now, listen carefully.

126
00:08:31,205 --> 00:08:34,158
You are in the Museum of Modern Art,
Marion.

127
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:37,161
Deep, Marion. Profound, Marion.

128
00:08:37,293 --> 00:08:40,413
You have come across this statue.
It says something to you

129
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:43,037
because you are intellectual,
always thinking.

130
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:46,339
What are you thinking?

131
00:08:46,468 --> 00:08:49,041
I'm thinking
this is taking a long time,

132
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:52,678
and I'll never be able to
pick up Harold's laundry.

133
00:08:52,974 --> 00:08:56,177
When Harold doesn't get his laundry,
disaster!

134
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,186
If we don't get this fixed, you may
never see Harold again. Let's go.

135
00:09:01,315 --> 00:09:05,312
The woman who thinks must come
to grips with fashionable attire.

136
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:09,571
A woman can be beautiful, as well
as intellectual. See facing page.

137
00:09:09,697 --> 00:09:11,108
And how is the facing page?

138
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:15,238
The facing page looks
as intellectual as a snake.

139
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:18,121
Nonsense. Marion can be very deep.

140
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:20,286
Look at her. She's reading.

141
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,536
Marion, dear, what are you reading?

142
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,128
Minute Men From Mars.

143
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:31,212
Are we all gonna hang around,
or get somebody else?

144
00:09:31,342 --> 00:09:33,879
- How about Lucy Brand?
- On her honeymoon.

145
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:36,680
- Betty Hayes?
- She's in jail.

146
00:09:36,805 --> 00:09:39,474
Are there no models
who think as well as they look?

147
00:09:39,599 --> 00:09:42,601
Marion might look better
in a different background.

148
00:09:42,728 --> 00:09:45,266
We can go on location.
An intellectual hang-out.

149
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,389
- Somewhere with books.
- A book store.

150
00:09:47,524 --> 00:09:51,189
A sinister place
in Greenwich Village. Come on, girls.

151
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,482
Let's hurry. We might have to pick up
Harold's laundry on the way.

152
00:10:03,038 --> 00:10:04,283
There's one.

153
00:10:05,248 --> 00:10:06,825
Driver, stop here.

154
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:08,416
That's sinister enough.

155
00:10:11,795 --> 00:10:14,417
Melissa, help me with this lamp.
It's heavy.

156
00:10:14,548 --> 00:10:16,873
I can't, Babs, I got my hands full.

157
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:27,801
It's movingly dismal. We couldn't
have done better if we'd designed it.

158
00:10:27,935 --> 00:10:30,223
Marion looks smarter already.

159
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:38,564
I'm sorry. I didn't see you up there.
Are you alright?

160
00:10:40,363 --> 00:10:44,941
Yes, thank you. Can I help you?
Would you like a book?

161
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:48,942
- Marion, over here.
- Who are those?

162
00:10:50,205 --> 00:10:51,580
May I help you?

163
00:10:51,706 --> 00:10:54,576
Thank you.
We have everything we need.

164
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,666
Please tell me what this is about.

165
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:59,000
We're just going to take
a few pictures.

166
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:00,707
What sort of pictures?

167
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,879
- Are you the owner?
- No, Dr Post is.

168
00:11:03,008 --> 00:11:05,296
I work here,
and I'm in charge in her absence.

169
00:11:05,427 --> 00:11:08,131
I'm Jo Stockton. Can you help me?

170
00:11:08,263 --> 00:11:10,338
How do you do? I'm Dick Avery.

171
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:11,967
What about these pictures?

172
00:11:12,099 --> 00:11:13,724
We want the shop as a background

173
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:16,520
for fashion pictures
for Quality magazine.

174
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:20,179
I'm sorry. I can't let you.
Dr Post would never approve.

175
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:22,557
She doesn't approve
of fashion magazines.

176
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:26,559
It's chi-chi and an unrealistic
approach to self-impressions.

177
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:30,313
- We have trouble. She's a thinker.
- She's also a talker.

178
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:32,276
I must ask you to leave.

179
00:11:32,409 --> 00:11:34,200
We throw ourselves at your mercy.

180
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:37,447
Haven't poor people like us
a right to make a living?

181
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,537
I asked you to leave.
That is my right.

182
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,243
If the rights of the individual

183
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,162
are not respected by the group,
the group cannot exist.

184
00:11:44,295 --> 00:11:45,494
What does that mean?

185
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:48,963
"Do unto others as
you would have others do unto you."

186
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:51,084
We'll only do unto you for a moment,

187
00:11:51,219 --> 00:11:54,634
and it's no more
than we would do unto ourselves.

188
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:56,886
Girls, I want these books rearranged.

189
00:11:57,015 --> 00:12:00,265
They look too much alike.
They're too pat. Mix them up.

190
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:02,516
No, you mustn't mix them up.

191
00:12:02,645 --> 00:12:05,219
The books on this shelf
pertain to empiricism,

192
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:08,974
and on this shelf, materialism,
and on this, psychopiscoparalysm.

193
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,525
Put them back. Please talk to her.
It'll take me hours.

194
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:15,572
One never talks to Maggie Prescott.
One only listens.

195
00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,648
Here. I think we ought to use her
in the shot. Miss, come here, please.

196
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:22,952
- Me?
- You're selling a book to that girl.

197
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,076
Her?

198
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:26,531
Just pretend that Marion can read.

199
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:28,125
Say, listen!

200
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:29,746
Alright, Marion, let's go.

201
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:33,294
But this would be a violation
of all my principles.

202
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:36,210
It would be hypocrisy for me
to lend myself to this.

203
00:12:36,342 --> 00:12:37,753
- I'm sorry, but...
- Shush.

204
00:12:37,885 --> 00:12:41,384
Now, tell Marion about the books
so that we can get out of here.

205
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,304
This deals with epiphenomenalism,
which has to do with consciousness

206
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:50,389
as a mere accessory
of physiological processes

207
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:55,432
whose presence or absence
makes no difference...

208
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,149
Whatever are you doing?

209
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,559
Hold it!

210
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:02,650
- Good. Get her in another outfit.
- Put on the shebop.

211
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,649
None of you seems to realise you're
trespassing on private property.

212
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,320
You run around, ignorant of the fact
that I can have you put in jail.

213
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,994
- For the last time...
- You're getting tiresome.

214
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,536
What are you doing?

215
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,660
Let go. Let go of my arm.

216
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:20,080
I know you don't mean any harm,
but you are in everyone's way.

217
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:21,625
Now, we won't be a moment.

218
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,211
Let me in.

219
00:13:24,343 --> 00:13:27,629
The air will do her good.
She was very pale.

220
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:37,135
Alright, hit it.

221
00:13:37,563 --> 00:13:39,437
Hold it. Ready?

222
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:41,356
Good. One more, please.

223
00:13:41,484 --> 00:13:43,559
Alright. Hit it.

224
00:13:43,694 --> 00:13:44,773
Hold it. Ready?

225
00:13:45,863 --> 00:13:48,485
Very good, Marion.
One more, please. Last one.

226
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:49,814
Alright, here we go.

227
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,409
Hit it.

228
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:53,326
Hold it. Ready.

229
00:13:53,454 --> 00:13:56,123
OK, that's it. That ought to do.

230
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,844
- Quite through?
- Thank you. You've been wonderful.

231
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,216
We'll mention the shop
in the magazine.

232
00:14:19,352 --> 00:14:20,632
Don't you dare!

233
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:22,596
Taxi!

234
00:14:24,815 --> 00:14:27,057
Oh, no!

235
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:30,689
Oh!

236
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,231
Hello there.

237
00:14:32,363 --> 00:14:34,486
I stayed to help you
put these back.

238
00:14:34,615 --> 00:14:36,987
I didn't realise we made such a mess.

239
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:39,655
Which shelf for materialism?

240
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:42,028
Just hand them to me.

241
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,573
Oh, no.

242
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:50,585
You should be ashamed of yourself.

243
00:14:50,713 --> 00:14:52,622
We don't usually barge in that way.

244
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,793
I mean a man of your ability
wasting his time

245
00:14:55,926 --> 00:14:58,796
photographing silly dresses
on silly women.

246
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:03,588
Most people think they're
beautiful dresses on beautiful women.

247
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,966
At most, a synthetic beauty.

248
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:08,888
Trees are beautiful.

249
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:13,264
Why don't you photograph trees?

250
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,519
I do what I do for a living.
It has to do with supply and demand.

251
00:15:16,653 --> 00:15:20,068
You'd be amazed how small
the demand is for pictures of trees.

252
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:22,523
My work is pleasant,
the pay is excellent,

253
00:15:22,658 --> 00:15:24,567
and I get a trip to Paris every year.

254
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:26,196
I certainly envy you that.

255
00:15:26,328 --> 00:15:29,115
I'd be in Paris now
if I could afford it.

256
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,328
You'd have a ball.

257
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:35,915
You'd go to a party every night,
drink champagne,

258
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:39,496
swim in perfume, and a new love
affair every hour on the hour.

259
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:43,415
If I went to Paris, it would be
to go to Emile Flostre's lectures.

260
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:45,509
Who goes to Paris for lectures?

261
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:48,554
Professor Flostre
is the greatest living philosopher,

262
00:15:48,682 --> 00:15:51,090
and father of empathicalism.

263
00:15:51,226 --> 00:15:53,896
Oh? What's empathicalism?

264
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:59,266
The most sensible approach to
true understanding and peace of mind.

265
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,942
Sounds great, but what is it?

266
00:16:01,069 --> 00:16:02,812
It's based on empathy.

267
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:05,270
Do you know
what the word "empathy" means?

268
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:08,323
No, I'll have to have
the beginner's course on that one.

269
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,941
Empathy.
Is it something like sympathy?

270
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:12,986
Oh, it goes beyond sympathy.

271
00:16:13,121 --> 00:16:15,825
Sympathy
is to understand what someone feels.

272
00:16:15,957 --> 00:16:18,282
Empathy
is to project your imagination

273
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:22,462
so that you actually feel
what the other person is feeling.

274
00:16:22,588 --> 00:16:25,423
You put yourself
in the other person's place.

275
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,790
Do I make myself clear?

276
00:16:37,977 --> 00:16:40,550
- Why did you do that?
- Empathy.

277
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:44,637
I put myself in your place and
I felt that you wanted to be kissed.

278
00:16:46,734 --> 00:16:48,940
You put yourself in the wrong place.

279
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:52,688
I have no desire to be kissed
by you, or anyone else.

280
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:56,523
Don't be silly. Everybody wants
to be kissed, even philosophers.

281
00:16:57,911 --> 00:17:01,077
I'm sorry, Mr Avery, we don't stock
what you're looking for.

282
00:17:01,206 --> 00:17:02,450
I'll let you out.

283
00:17:02,582 --> 00:17:05,867
Don't bother. I'll throw myself out.

284
00:17:09,671 --> 00:17:10,667
Goodbye.

285
00:17:20,097 --> 00:17:25,257
¶ I was taught that
I ought not expose my inner senses

286
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:30,811
¶ Had no plan for a man

287
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,226
¶ I was full of self-defences

288
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:44,738
¶ Now I feel that I really
should face the consequences

289
00:17:45,537 --> 00:17:49,237
¶ My philosophic search

290
00:17:49,374 --> 00:17:54,001
¶ Has left me in the lurch

291
00:17:55,338 --> 00:18:02,087
¶ I must find why my mind
is behaving like a dancer

292
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:08,304
¶ What's the clue to pursue?

293
00:18:08,683 --> 00:18:14,472
¶ For I have to have the answer

294
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:23,772
¶ I could cry salty tears

295
00:18:23,905 --> 00:18:30,109
¶ Where have I been all these years?

296
00:18:30,995 --> 00:18:33,237
¶ Is it fun?

297
00:18:33,706 --> 00:18:35,663
¶ Or should I run?

298
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:41,165
¶ How long has this been going on?

299
00:18:42,672 --> 00:18:48,258
¶ There were chills up my spine

300
00:18:48,969 --> 00:18:54,924
¶ And some thrills I can't define

301
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,967
¶ Does it show?

302
00:18:58,103 --> 00:18:59,894
¶ And who would know?

303
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:05,181
¶ How long has this been going on?

304
00:19:06,485 --> 00:19:12,071
¶ Oh, I feel that I could melt

305
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:17,154
¶ Into heaven I'm hurled

306
00:19:18,746 --> 00:19:23,906
¶ I know how Columbus felt

307
00:19:24,626 --> 00:19:30,629
¶ Finding another world

308
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:36,132
¶ Can I trust how I feel?

309
00:19:37,388 --> 00:19:43,425
¶ Is this my Achilles heel?

310
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:49,389
¶ Look at me, I'm all at sea

311
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:57,269
¶ How long has this been going on?

312
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:24,638
¶ This is grand

313
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:27,337
¶ This is great

314
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:36,138
¶ I'm in such a lovely state

315
00:20:38,777 --> 00:20:41,861
¶ Can one kiss

316
00:20:44,198 --> 00:20:47,898
¶ Do all of this?

317
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:36,784
What do you think?

318
00:21:36,912 --> 00:21:39,319
Good models.
What have you in mind?

319
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:41,365
A fantastic idea.

320
00:21:41,499 --> 00:21:43,955
It staggers me
nobody's thought of it before.

321
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:46,754
I'm going to select a girl
to be the Quality Woman.

322
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:50,462
This girl will represent everything
the magazine stands for.

323
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:54,090
It's a great gimmick. Any
of these models would be alright.

324
00:21:54,219 --> 00:21:58,134
She's got to be more than alright.
She's got to have pizzazz.

325
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:02,132
A collection will be designed for her
by the greatest couturier in Paris.

326
00:22:02,269 --> 00:22:04,676
- Paul Duval?
- Yes, Paul Duval.

327
00:22:04,813 --> 00:22:09,059
And he's going to let us photograph
the collection before the opening.

328
00:22:09,192 --> 00:22:11,564
We'll scoop every other magazine.

329
00:22:11,694 --> 00:22:13,900
- Staggers you, doesn't it?
- I can't believe it.

330
00:22:14,029 --> 00:22:18,109
He would be barred
from all the other fashion magazines.

331
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:22,109
Nonsense. If the project comes off,
we'll all be heroes.

332
00:22:22,245 --> 00:22:26,492
Wait till you see what I've got.
The girl. The Quality Woman.

333
00:22:26,624 --> 00:22:27,787
Oh, Marion's...

334
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:30,953
Forget her. This is the other girl
I'm talking about.

335
00:22:31,086 --> 00:22:32,995
That thing from the book shop?

336
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,703
Maggie, she's new.

337
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:37,503
She's fresh.

338
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:39,253
You've gone out of your mind.

339
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:42,505
One can't deny that she is unusual.
Who is she?

340
00:22:42,638 --> 00:22:46,422
Don't even ask. The thought of her
makes me shudder. Dreadful girl.

341
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,385
If this is some sort ofjoke...

342
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:51,970
It's no joke. If we do her over
and fix her up, she'd be great.

343
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,385
She'd devour us all.

344
00:22:53,523 --> 00:22:55,681
- Come on, Maggie.
- Well, look at her.

345
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,816
I think her face is perfectly funny.

346
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:02,064
The Quality Woman must have grace,
elegance and pizzazz.

347
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:04,867
This is the first time
I've seen you lack imagination.

348
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:08,407
Every girl in Quality
has grace, elegance and pizzazz.

349
00:23:08,536 --> 00:23:11,905
What about a girl with character,
spirit and intelligence?

350
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:14,246
That would be novel
in a fashion magazine.

351
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:16,332
Sir, I owe you a drink.

352
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,369
Can you make me some enlargements?

353
00:23:18,504 --> 00:23:20,211
- Yes.
- Use our darkroom.

354
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:23,256
- Let me study the possibilities.
- Now you are talking.

355
00:23:23,383 --> 00:23:26,384
- I'm not promising anything.
- You don't have to.

356
00:23:27,512 --> 00:23:30,845
Runs around here
Iike he owns the magazine.

357
00:23:30,973 --> 00:23:33,464
Lettie, remember that creature
in the book shop?

358
00:23:33,601 --> 00:23:35,308
Get her up here. Order books.

359
00:23:35,435 --> 00:23:38,685
- A large order, so she can't refuse.
- $50 worth?

360
00:23:38,813 --> 00:23:41,351
Yes, $50 worth if necessary.

361
00:23:41,483 --> 00:23:45,811
$50 to get her up here. We'll have to
drug her to get her to Paris.

362
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:56,996
Er, Miss Prescott, please.

363
00:23:57,122 --> 00:24:00,954
- Lettie, you'd better come out here.
- I've got the books she ordered.

364
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:04,995
Miss Prescott's secretary
will deal with you.

365
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:08,542
Oh, it's you. Well, come on in.

366
00:24:09,217 --> 00:24:10,415
Come on.

367
00:24:16,265 --> 00:24:17,759
The books are here.

368
00:24:22,562 --> 00:24:23,760
Come in.

369
00:24:31,653 --> 00:24:35,982
That'll be $52 and 75 cents,
and $1.20 for the taxi.

370
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:37,942
$53.95.

371
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:39,867
Drop the books.

372
00:24:39,994 --> 00:24:41,572
Come on, drop the books.

373
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:43,946
- On the floor?
- Yes, drop them.

374
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,702
Straighten up, shoulders back.

375
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:52,880
If you girls only knew
how important posture is.

376
00:24:53,006 --> 00:24:55,627
I didn't come here
to enrol in a military school.

377
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:58,545
All I want is $53.95.

378
00:24:58,677 --> 00:25:00,385
The Modigliani is $12.50,

379
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:03,846
and the Braque and Hieronymus Bosch
come to $22.75.

380
00:25:03,974 --> 00:25:06,097
$7 for the postimpressionists

381
00:25:06,226 --> 00:25:09,143
and $10.50 for The Egyptians -
Fourth to Seventh Dynasties

382
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:13,433
make it a total of $52.75,
and there's $1.20 for the taxi.

383
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,973
- Talks incessantly.
- The body's good.

384
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:18,731
It'll be better
when we get through with it.

385
00:25:18,862 --> 00:25:22,231
- Through with what?
- She might do.

386
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:23,776
Might do what?

387
00:25:24,701 --> 00:25:26,325
The bones are good.

388
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:30,070
Suppose we leave my bones alone
and give me my $53.95?

389
00:25:30,206 --> 00:25:32,115
The eyebrows up, a light powder.

390
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:35,369
I want a little rouge here.
She needs a marvellous mouth.

391
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:37,993
The hair is awful. It must come off.

392
00:25:38,129 --> 00:25:40,702
Would you mind telling me
what all this is about?

393
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:44,922
We may as well get started. Babs,
get that dreadful thing off of her.

394
00:25:45,052 --> 00:25:47,757
Now, wait a minute. Just a minute.

395
00:25:47,888 --> 00:25:49,715
Don't! Stop!

396
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:53,717
This is my second and last encounter
with you lunatics.

397
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,307
You just keep your hands off me,
all of you.

398
00:25:56,979 --> 00:26:00,431
I make a delivery and find myself
being pillaged and plundered.

399
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,770
Well, I'll have no more of it.
I don't want my hair cut.

400
00:26:03,903 --> 00:26:07,237
I don't want my eyebrows up or down.
I want them where they are.

401
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:12,110
And I see no functional advantage
in a marvellous mouth.

402
00:26:12,244 --> 00:26:15,198
I'm leaving now, and if anyone
makes a move to stop me

403
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,200
there'll be plenty of hair cut,
and it won't be mine.

404
00:26:21,544 --> 00:26:22,824
Bring her back, girls, alive!

405
00:26:29,843 --> 00:26:31,254
Hurry up.

406
00:26:34,556 --> 00:26:36,595
Hurry. Over here.

407
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:46,525
Hey,
didn't you see that light outside?

408
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,899
In desperation, one does not examine
one's avenue of escape.

409
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:52,571
Oh, it's you.

410
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:57,357
I'm sorry if I spoiled a print.

411
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:01,324
That's alright.
What's all the desperation about?

412
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,162
Those people.

413
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:06,160
They don't care about
anyone's feelings.

414
00:27:06,918 --> 00:27:09,872
Pulling my clothes
and cutting my hair.

415
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:13,005
Is that girl in there?

416
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:15,089
Don't give me away.

417
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:17,423
Maybe you should give them
a chance...

418
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,675
There was no one here when I came in.

419
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,844
If you see her, hang on to her.

420
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,177
I'll do that.

421
00:27:26,894 --> 00:27:31,223
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
I thought you'd make a good model.

422
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:33,691
This is your idea?

423
00:27:33,817 --> 00:27:35,726
Yeah, I'm the one you sue.

424
00:27:36,361 --> 00:27:38,400
Oh, how could I be a model?

425
00:27:39,322 --> 00:27:42,773
I have no illusions about my looks.
I think my face is funny.

426
00:27:42,908 --> 00:27:44,486
That's what Maggie said.

427
00:27:44,618 --> 00:27:46,575
I hate to admit it,
but she's right.

428
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:50,321
What you call funny,
I call interesting.

429
00:27:52,792 --> 00:27:55,544
It's too ridiculous
even to think about.

430
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,370
- I couldn't do it.
- Let me be the judge of that.

431
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:03,999
I wouldn't take you to Paris
if I didn't think you'd work out.

432
00:28:04,137 --> 00:28:07,303
- Paris?
- Yeah. Look at it this way.

433
00:28:07,431 --> 00:28:09,637
Modelling
may not be as bad as you think.

434
00:28:09,808 --> 00:28:14,019
If it is, you'll be in Paris.
You can see your Professor Whosis.

435
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:15,770
- Flostre?
- Yeah.

436
00:28:15,897 --> 00:28:18,352
You can talk to him
and go to his lectures.

437
00:28:18,483 --> 00:28:20,522
That way it won't be a total loss.

438
00:28:21,485 --> 00:28:23,312
A means to an end.

439
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:26,814
Or a means to a beginning,
according to how it works out.

440
00:28:26,949 --> 00:28:28,147
Now, let's see.

441
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:31,410
There we are.

442
00:28:31,536 --> 00:28:34,537
- Oh, no.
- What's the matter?

443
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:37,949
How can you possibly
make a model out of that?

444
00:28:38,084 --> 00:28:39,542
You can't be serious.

445
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:41,910
When I'm done, you'll look like...

446
00:28:42,045 --> 00:28:46,707
What do you call beautiful?
A tree. You'll look like a tree.

447
00:28:47,342 --> 00:28:50,924
¶ Frankly, dear,
your modesty reveals to me

448
00:28:51,054 --> 00:28:53,627
¶ Self-appraisal often makes us sad

449
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,340
¶ And if I add, your funny face
appeals to me

450
00:28:58,894 --> 00:29:01,681
¶ Please don't think
I've suddenly gone mad

451
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:06,639
¶ You have all the qualities
of Peter Pan

452
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,195
¶ I'd go far before I'd find
a sweeter pan

453
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:17,660
¶ I love your funny face

454
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:23,867
¶ Your sunny, funny face

455
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,044
¶ For you're a cutie

456
00:29:29,171 --> 00:29:32,088
¶ With more than beauty

457
00:29:32,215 --> 00:29:39,095
¶ You've got a lot of
personality for me

458
00:29:39,222 --> 00:29:43,930
¶ You fill the air with smiles

459
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:49,387
¶ For miles and miles and miles

460
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,644
¶ Though you're no Mona Lisa

461
00:29:53,776 --> 00:29:56,777
¶ For worlds I'd not replace

462
00:29:56,904 --> 00:30:00,771
¶ Your sunny, funny face

463
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:05,167
¶ I love your funny face

464
00:31:07,051 --> 00:31:10,466
¶ Your sunny, funny face

465
00:31:12,347 --> 00:31:15,134
¶ You're not exotic

466
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:17,971
¶ But so hypnotic

467
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:20,975
¶ You're much too much

468
00:31:21,606 --> 00:31:25,306
¶ If you can cook the way you look

469
00:31:25,442 --> 00:31:28,941
¶ I'd swim the ocean wide

470
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:35,281
¶ Just to have you by my side

471
00:31:36,786 --> 00:31:38,992
¶ Though you're no Queen of Sheba

472
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:43,533
¶ For worlds I'd not replace

473
00:31:54,093 --> 00:31:55,966
¶ Your sunny

474
00:31:57,137 --> 00:31:59,593
¶ funny

475
00:32:00,474 --> 00:32:03,593
¶ face

476
00:32:14,028 --> 00:32:17,646
Ladies, feast your eyes
on our Quality Woman.

477
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,240
Marvellous!

478
00:32:20,826 --> 00:32:23,399
I'm sorry about the trouble.
I didn't realise.

479
00:32:23,537 --> 00:32:27,534
My dear, let me do the apologising.
I behaved abominably.

480
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:30,203
She's agreed to go to Paris.
She can hardly wait.

481
00:32:30,335 --> 00:32:31,330
Marvellous!

482
00:32:31,461 --> 00:32:35,410
This is not a loss of integrity.
It is a means to an end, and...

483
00:32:35,548 --> 00:32:38,169
There's no time for talking.
Tell us on the plane.

484
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,132
Alright, girls, we've got to
get cracking. To work and to Paris.

485
00:33:38,479 --> 00:33:42,013
- Would you like a tour of Paris?
- No, we're not tourists.

486
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,390
Do we look like people
who gape all day?

487
00:33:44,526 --> 00:33:47,099
They can't understand anyone
coming here to work.

488
00:33:47,237 --> 00:33:50,403
We should all go straight to
our hotels and get some rest.

489
00:33:50,531 --> 00:33:52,773
- I am exhausted.
- I know how you feel.

490
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:55,446
I'm so tired it's an effort for me
to say I'm tired.

491
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,282
Goodbye.
I'll be in touch.

492
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:17,046
¶ I want to step out

493
00:34:17,181 --> 00:34:18,805
¶ Down the Champs Elysées

494
00:34:18,933 --> 00:34:20,640
¶ From the Arch of Triumph

495
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,310
¶ To the Petit Palais

496
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:25,057
¶ That's for me

497
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,723
¶ Bonjour, Paris

498
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,442
¶ I want to wander

499
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,146
¶ Through the Saint-Honoré

500
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:34,986
¶ Do some window-shopping

501
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,738
¶ In the Rue de la Paix

502
00:34:36,865 --> 00:34:39,486
¶ That's for me

503
00:34:39,618 --> 00:34:42,903
¶ Bonjour, Paris

504
00:34:44,956 --> 00:34:47,493
¶ I want to see the den
of thinking men

505
00:34:47,625 --> 00:34:50,495
¶ Like Jean-Paul Sartre

506
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:54,708
¶ I must philosophise
with all the guys

507
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,339
¶ Around Montmartre and Montparnasse

508
00:34:58,468 --> 00:35:00,176
¶ I'm strictly tourist

509
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:01,963
¶ But I couldn't care less

510
00:35:02,096 --> 00:35:03,756
¶ When they parlez-vous me

511
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:05,467
¶ Then I gotta confess

512
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,220
¶ That's for me

513
00:35:08,352 --> 00:35:12,183
¶ Bonjour, Paris

514
00:35:12,856 --> 00:35:14,266
¶ Light up the Louvre museum

515
00:35:14,399 --> 00:35:15,941
¶ Jazz up the Latin quarter

516
00:35:16,067 --> 00:35:19,067
¶ To show the richest
and the poorest

517
00:35:19,195 --> 00:35:20,570
¶ Here it comes

518
00:35:20,696 --> 00:35:24,112
¶ The great American tourist

519
00:35:24,241 --> 00:35:27,241
¶ This has got to be illegal

520
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,278
¶ What I feel

521
00:35:29,412 --> 00:35:31,701
¶ Très gai, très chic,
très magnifique

522
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:36,160
¶ C'est moi, c'est vous,
c'est grand, c'est tutu

523
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:39,294
¶ It's too good to be true

524
00:35:39,421 --> 00:35:42,422
¶ All the things we can do

525
00:35:42,549 --> 00:35:47,791
¶ You do things to my point of view

526
00:35:47,929 --> 00:35:49,304
¶ We can show you the north

527
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,841
¶ Or we can show you the south

528
00:35:50,973 --> 00:35:52,550
¶ Then we can show you the west

529
00:35:52,683 --> 00:35:56,727
¶ Come on and show me the best

530
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:05,980
¶ That's for me

531
00:36:06,112 --> 00:36:08,187
¶ Bonjour, Paris

532
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:10,361
- Bonjour!
- Bonjour!

533
00:36:16,497 --> 00:36:19,070
¶ That's for me

534
00:36:19,208 --> 00:36:21,283
¶ Bonjour, Paris

535
00:36:21,418 --> 00:36:23,706
¶ Bonjour!

536
00:36:33,929 --> 00:36:35,092
¶ Living is easy

537
00:36:35,222 --> 00:36:37,048
¶ The living is high

538
00:36:37,182 --> 00:36:38,380
¶ All good Americans

539
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:39,975
¶ Should come here to die

540
00:36:40,101 --> 00:36:41,512
¶ Bonjour!

541
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:52,069
¶ Is it real?

542
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:53,939
¶ Am I here?

543
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:01,661
¶ Am I here?

544
00:37:01,787 --> 00:37:03,827
¶ Is it real?

545
00:37:47,036 --> 00:37:51,579
¶ There's something missing

546
00:37:51,707 --> 00:37:55,407
¶ There's something missing, I know

547
00:37:55,544 --> 00:37:57,619
¶ There's something missing

548
00:37:57,754 --> 00:38:00,423
¶ Something missing, I know

549
00:38:00,548 --> 00:38:07,629
¶ There's still one place
I've got to go

550
00:38:25,988 --> 00:38:28,064
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

551
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:29,776
¶ I thought that you were tired

552
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:31,284
¶ I heard you say that you

553
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,987
¶ You said
that you were so exhausted

554
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,365
¶ You said you needed sleep

555
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:35,575
¶ You told me that you had to rest

556
00:38:35,705 --> 00:38:37,247
¶ You said you ought to rest

557
00:38:37,374 --> 00:38:39,200
¶ Is this what you call rest?

558
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:42,583
¶ This fussing and fretting
is getting my goat

559
00:38:42,712 --> 00:38:44,170
¶ Let's all let our hair down

560
00:38:44,296 --> 00:38:45,292
¶ We're in the same boat

561
00:38:45,422 --> 00:38:47,249
¶ We're strictly tourists

562
00:38:47,382 --> 00:38:48,960
¶ You can titter and jeer

563
00:38:49,092 --> 00:38:50,634
¶ All we want to say is

564
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,171
¶ Lafayette, we are here

565
00:38:52,304 --> 00:38:54,759
¶ On a spree

566
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:57,345
¶ Bonjour, Paris

567
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:59,514
- Bonjour.
- Bonjour.

568
00:39:02,146 --> 00:39:03,344
Bonjour!

569
00:39:04,606 --> 00:39:06,433
Well, how was that?

570
00:39:11,612 --> 00:39:13,190
Allo?

571
00:39:13,322 --> 00:39:17,616
Duval! I can't hear myself think,
and I'm trying to think in French.

572
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:20,198
- Maggie!
- Ssh! I'm calling again.

573
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:22,866
I shouldn't design
a collection for you.

574
00:39:22,998 --> 00:39:26,615
I am jeopardising my position
with Harper's Bazaar and Vogue,

575
00:39:26,751 --> 00:39:28,542
all for a girl who does not appear.

576
00:39:28,669 --> 00:39:33,829
You're too important for jeopardy.
Relax. She will be here without fail.

577
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:37,500
You said she would be here at ten
this morning. It is now past five.

578
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:39,961
- She's not at the hotel.
- Forget about her.

579
00:39:40,096 --> 00:39:43,595
We've started the campaign.
There isn't time to get someone else.

580
00:39:43,724 --> 00:39:44,756
Well, where is she?

581
00:39:44,892 --> 00:39:48,343
Maybe at the top of the Eiffel Tower,
or the bottom of the Seine.

582
00:39:48,479 --> 00:39:51,314
Maybe she's in a traffic jam.
How should I know?

583
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,638
Oh, c'est naturel.

584
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:56,772
¶ Bonjour, Paris

585
00:39:56,903 --> 00:39:58,646
Bonjour, bonjour.

586
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:01,816
I'm throwing a shindig
to christen the Quality Woman.

587
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:04,522
Leave it to Dick to find
a delicatessen in Paris.

588
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,744
Imported all the way
from Napa Valley, California.

589
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,033
Melons from Florida.

590
00:40:09,164 --> 00:40:12,283
About the guest of honour.
Where is she? How does she look?

591
00:40:12,417 --> 00:40:14,623
If she's here, she looks invisible.

592
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,461
- She didn't show?
- She did not.

593
00:40:16,588 --> 00:40:19,161
These gentlemen are waiting
to do her face, hair.

594
00:40:19,299 --> 00:40:21,754
Duval needs measurements.
Where is she?

595
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:24,755
I wouldn't like to swear in court,
but I have an idea.

596
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:27,460
Do keep it to yourself!

597
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:30,967
I'll have her here
tomorrow morning at ten without fail.

598
00:40:31,101 --> 00:40:33,058
In the meantime, be my guests.

599
00:40:35,939 --> 00:40:36,934
Strike.

600
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:58,956
Salaud! Dégueulasse!

601
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,282
Je vous déteste!

602
00:41:00,961 --> 00:41:02,159
Oh, chéri.

603
00:41:03,463 --> 00:41:05,290
This must be the place.

604
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:20,092
Thank you.

605
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,767
Monsieur, Gigi would like to dance.

606
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,856
- Who's Gigi?
- I am Gigi.

607
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:30,816
Some other time. I just stopped by
to pick up the wife and kids.

608
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:35,026
All that is delicious
is not nutritious.

609
00:41:35,283 --> 00:41:37,323
Avaricious, av...

610
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,658
I feel a hostile vibration.

611
00:41:39,787 --> 00:41:41,412
That'll be me. Sorry.

612
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:49,789
Has he been that way long?

613
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:52,839
Three hours.
It is the ultimate in concentration.

614
00:41:52,966 --> 00:41:54,709
Feels so good when you stop.

615
00:41:56,469 --> 00:41:59,007
I have no doubt
that in less than ten years,

616
00:41:59,138 --> 00:42:04,214
people everywhere will know that
only empathicalism can bring peace.

617
00:42:04,351 --> 00:42:07,850
Peace through understanding
is the only real...

618
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:11,607
Well, hello. How are you?

619
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:13,690
Just fine, thank you.
How are you?

620
00:42:13,818 --> 00:42:15,478
How long have you been in Paris?

621
00:42:15,611 --> 00:42:17,937
This is Mr Avery.
These are my friends.

622
00:42:18,073 --> 00:42:20,112
How do you do, boys?

623
00:42:20,241 --> 00:42:23,740
Would you mind if I had
my own conversation with this lady?

624
00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:27,036
- They don't understand English.
- You were talking English.

625
00:42:27,164 --> 00:42:30,912
It's hard to explain,
but it's all part of empathicalism.

626
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:33,913
We don't have to communicate
with words.

627
00:42:34,045 --> 00:42:37,912
They understand me through the way
I feel, and the tone of my voice.

628
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:41,583
- Sort of like a dog.
- Obviously, you don't understand.

629
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:43,213
Who's buying the wine?

630
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:45,752
- I am.
- I understand more than you think.

631
00:42:45,889 --> 00:42:49,423
- If you're saying that the wine...
- Let me show you something.

632
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:55,309
Gentlemen, may I tell you
that you look like a mess of worms?

633
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:59,271
And that you not only look like,
but you are, a mess of worms.

634
00:42:59,401 --> 00:43:01,808
I'll bet you've been here
all these years

635
00:43:01,945 --> 00:43:04,862
because if you left,
you'd be picked up for vagrancy.

636
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:07,527
- Bravo.
- Your defence rests.

637
00:43:07,658 --> 00:43:09,781
This isn't funny.
You don't belong here.

638
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,662
Neither do you,
which brings us to why I'm here.

639
00:43:12,788 --> 00:43:14,579
Monsieur, you dance with Mimi?

640
00:43:14,706 --> 00:43:17,162
No, thanks, I'm busy.
Didn't Gigi tell you?

641
00:43:17,292 --> 00:43:20,708
That's very rude,
refusing to dance with Mimi.

642
00:43:20,837 --> 00:43:23,754
Where I come from,
the man asks the girl to dance.

643
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,921
You must come from the Stone Age.

644
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,546
We think freely here. If a girl wants
to dance with a man, she asks him.

645
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,213
We're not inhibited by
outmoded social conventions.

646
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:37,848
I can see that.
Do you ask men to dance with you?

647
00:43:38,561 --> 00:43:40,185
Isn't it time you realised

648
00:43:40,313 --> 00:43:44,641
that dancing is nothing more than
a form of expression or release?

649
00:43:44,775 --> 00:43:48,060
There's no need to be formal
or cute about it.

650
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:52,524
As a matter of fact, I rather feel
Iike expressing myself now.

651
00:43:52,657 --> 00:43:54,815
And I could certainly use a release.

652
00:47:31,938 --> 00:47:35,389
- Bonsoir. Vous étiez formidable.
- Merci.

653
00:47:35,525 --> 00:47:38,525
You certainly made friends
and influenced people.

654
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:40,941
They're empathicalists.

655
00:47:41,071 --> 00:47:45,697
You talk a lot about empathy.
Ever do anything about it yourself?

656
00:47:45,825 --> 00:47:47,367
I don't know what you mean.

657
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:51,408
- Why not throw some empathy my way?
- I still don't know what you mean.

658
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:54,112
How do you think I feel
when you don't show up?

659
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,530
I'm responsible for you.

660
00:47:55,668 --> 00:47:59,535
An empathicalist should feel me
asking for unemployment insurance.

661
00:47:59,671 --> 00:48:01,249
Show up where?

662
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:05,330
They've been waiting for you
at Duval's all day.

663
00:48:05,468 --> 00:48:08,385
I had no idea. Nobody told me.

664
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:11,383
We've been calling you
on the telephone for hours.

665
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:18,053
I've been at the café all day.
I'm terribly sorry.

666
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:21,354
I don't want to sound like
the personnel department,

667
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:24,852
but you ought to get to bed early.
The camera picks up everything.

668
00:48:24,986 --> 00:48:28,022
I don't want to spend my life
retouching your pictures.

669
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:32,070
When we're done, you can spend
all your time making small talk.

670
00:48:32,201 --> 00:48:36,412
Small talk? I suppose you think
the neckline of a dress

671
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:39,492
makes for world-shaking conversation?

672
00:48:39,624 --> 00:48:42,791
Anything you don't understand,
you call small talk.

673
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:45,955
- What do you think of Flostre?
- Don't change the subject.

674
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:48,923
- It's the same subject.
- I haven't met Flostre.

675
00:48:49,050 --> 00:48:52,584
You haven't? By now
I thought you two'd be buddies.

676
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:56,847
You don't find Flostre in cafés,
except on special occasions.

677
00:48:56,973 --> 00:49:00,389
Not everyone interested in
empathicalism meets him,

678
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:03,435
any more than every American
meets the President.

679
00:49:03,562 --> 00:49:06,896
An invitation to Flostre's home
is a great honour,

680
00:49:07,024 --> 00:49:09,479
and as hard to get
as an invitation to...

681
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,353
The White House.

682
00:49:11,486 --> 00:49:14,238
I don't think jokes about Flostre
are funny.

683
00:49:14,364 --> 00:49:17,779
No more jokes. But let's be friendly.
We have to work together.

684
00:49:17,909 --> 00:49:22,202
You don't have to be friendly
to work together. Acquainted will do.

685
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:24,618
Am I supposed to
go over to Duval's now?

686
00:49:24,748 --> 00:49:26,575
I said you'd be there at 10:30 a.m.

687
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:28,582
- I'll be there.
- Promise?

688
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:30,537
I said I'd be there, and I will.

689
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:33,339
- Alright.
- This is where I get off.

690
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:36,585
Wait a minute. Don't go away mad.

691
00:49:36,717 --> 00:49:40,845
Can't we walk and get friendly,
or better acquainted, or something?

692
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:43,426
No, thanks. I've got to go to bed.

693
00:49:43,557 --> 00:49:47,554
I don't want you spending
your life retouching my pictures.

694
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:49,428
You are mad, aren't you?

695
00:49:51,439 --> 00:49:53,265
No, I'm not mad, I...

696
00:49:55,192 --> 00:49:58,276
I'm hurt, and disappointed, and...

697
00:49:59,738 --> 00:50:00,936
..and mad.

698
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:36,935
¶ I didn't mean to
start any scene to

699
00:50:37,064 --> 00:50:39,733
¶ Make you sigh, or to die

700
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:43,317
¶ It's most immoral
for us to quarrel

701
00:50:43,444 --> 00:50:46,480
¶ Why can't we both agree?

702
00:50:46,614 --> 00:50:50,314
¶ Don't you know Ben Franklin
wrote about this thing at length?

703
00:50:50,451 --> 00:50:54,115
¶ On the proposition that
in union there is strength

704
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:59,029
¶ Why raise a storm up
if we'll just warm up?

705
00:50:59,167 --> 00:51:04,955
¶ We'll be much stronger
and live much longer

706
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:07,795
¶ Let's kiss and make up

707
00:51:07,925 --> 00:51:10,047
¶ Come on, let's wake up

708
00:51:10,177 --> 00:51:13,462
¶ For I need you, and you need me

709
00:51:14,597 --> 00:51:16,673
¶ Let's kiss and make up

710
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:18,764
¶ No use to break up

711
00:51:18,893 --> 00:51:22,261
¶ When we can work in harmony

712
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:25,394
¶ I'll give you your way

713
00:51:25,524 --> 00:51:27,599
¶ You'll give me my way

714
00:51:27,734 --> 00:51:29,857
¶ And out the doorway

715
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,943
¶ Our cares will fly away

716
00:51:32,071 --> 00:51:34,194
¶ If we'd be happy

717
00:51:34,323 --> 00:51:36,280
¶ The way is clear

718
00:51:36,408 --> 00:51:38,484
¶ Let's kiss and make up

719
00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:40,741
¶ No use to break up

720
00:51:40,871 --> 00:51:44,156
¶ We need each other, dear

721
00:55:01,093 --> 00:55:03,216
What are they doing?
They've been hours.

722
00:55:03,345 --> 00:55:05,384
There was a lot to be done.

723
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:09,884
- They don't look happy.
- They don't look unhappy.

724
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:13,934
I can't tell. Do they look pleased?

725
00:55:14,063 --> 00:55:17,017
- They don't look displeased.
- Everyone.

726
00:55:17,149 --> 00:55:19,437
- The grand finale.
- I'm getting nervous.

727
00:55:19,568 --> 00:55:21,809
- You should.
- Sit down.

728
00:55:21,945 --> 00:55:27,531
Friends, you saw enter here a waif,
a gamin, a lowly caterpillar.

729
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:32,109
We open the cocoon but
it is not a butterfly that emerges.

730
00:55:32,246 --> 00:55:37,156
- It's not?
- No, it is a bird of paradise.

731
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,247
Lights!

732
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,541
Curtain!

733
00:56:02,898 --> 00:56:04,096
Oh...

734
00:56:30,798 --> 00:56:34,547
- Beautiful! I don't believe it.
- Maggie, what did I tell you?

735
00:56:34,678 --> 00:56:37,464
You look absolutely fabulous.
How does it feel?

736
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:39,720
It feels wonderful, but it's not me.

737
00:56:39,849 --> 00:56:42,386
The hair, the dress. It's perfection.

738
00:56:42,518 --> 00:56:45,139
You see how much we accomplish
when you appear?

739
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:49,647
Try to stay with us for a while.
Duval shows the collection on Friday.

740
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:52,561
The night before,
we'll introduce you to the press.

741
00:56:52,694 --> 00:56:55,564
It is your opportunity.
It will be your evening.

742
00:56:55,696 --> 00:56:57,854
- You will be there?
- Yes, of course.

743
00:56:57,990 --> 00:57:00,481
Dick, that gives you a week
to photograph her.

744
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:03,820
I want marvellous pictures.
Give me a lot of pizzazz.

745
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:07,654
Take her, and whatever you do,
don't let her out of your sight.

746
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:10,990
Do what I tell you.
Don't worry about it.

747
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:15,290
Here, hold these balloons high
in the air, and when I say "run",

748
00:57:15,422 --> 00:57:18,755
run as fast as you can
and don't let the balloons go.

749
00:57:18,884 --> 00:57:21,505
Run as fast as I can
and don't let the balloons go.

750
00:57:21,678 --> 00:57:23,966
Right. Now, ready?

751
00:57:24,097 --> 00:57:27,097
Head up a little. You're so happy.

752
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:28,802
Alright, run!

753
00:57:28,934 --> 00:57:30,132
Run!

754
00:57:30,269 --> 00:57:32,178
What? Oh, why did I ever...

755
00:57:32,854 --> 00:57:35,345
- What's wrong?
- I don't know which way to go.

756
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:36,940
That way.

757
00:57:37,067 --> 00:57:40,186
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
I've never done anything like this.

758
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:44,186
There's nothing to be nervous about.
You're in Paris, the Tuileries.

759
00:57:44,323 --> 00:57:48,237
You've got balloons. There's
a sudden shower. You're very happy.

760
00:57:48,368 --> 00:57:51,073
- Why am I so happy?
- Because I say you are.

761
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:55,825
That's all you have to know.
You're happy. Now, run!

762
00:57:57,084 --> 00:57:58,282
Great. That's great.

763
00:57:58,419 --> 00:57:59,617
Now, stop!

764
00:58:00,629 --> 00:58:01,827
Wonderful!

765
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:12,387
Now, today you're not happy.

766
00:58:12,515 --> 00:58:15,006
- I'm hurt and...
- Right, a creature of tragedy.

767
00:58:15,142 --> 00:58:18,226
Heartbroken, suffering.
You're Anna Karenina.

768
00:58:18,770 --> 00:58:20,597
Shall I throw myself under the train?

769
00:58:20,731 --> 00:58:25,107
We'll see. For now, just wonderful,
noble self-sacrifice.

770
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:27,940
Your lover
has just kissed you goodbye.

771
00:58:31,407 --> 00:58:34,194
You may never know that kiss again,
or love again.

772
00:58:34,326 --> 00:58:36,652
Marcel, put some tears in her eyes.

773
00:58:39,623 --> 00:58:41,415
There are tears in her eyes.

774
00:58:41,542 --> 00:58:44,377
Good. You're not only a model,
you're an actress.

775
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:50,125
Jo, give me the works.
Heartbreak, longing, tragedy.

776
00:58:50,258 --> 00:58:51,882
Wet your lips.

777
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,132
Good. Alright. Now, la steam!

778
00:58:55,262 --> 00:58:56,258
La steam!

779
00:58:56,388 --> 00:58:58,760
That's great. Just like the movie.

780
00:58:58,891 --> 00:59:00,764
Poor Anna Karenina.

781
00:59:00,892 --> 00:59:02,470
No, not too much steam.

782
00:59:02,602 --> 00:59:06,682
Cut down the steam.
That's wonderful. That's it.

783
00:59:09,775 --> 00:59:14,152
Good. Now give her some flowers.
Flowers. Arms full.

784
00:59:14,279 --> 00:59:17,280
Alright. More. More. More!

785
00:59:17,657 --> 00:59:20,230
Alright, Jo, it's spring.
You're in love.

786
00:59:20,368 --> 00:59:23,369
Now, turn around. Fabulous!

787
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:40,167
You're walking out of the opera,

788
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:43,256
Ieaving to the passionate
music of Tristan und Isolde.

789
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:45,714
- You're very unhappy.
- What happened now?

790
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,925
A rendezvous at the opera.
Two seats.

791
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:50,052
He didn't show up. You're furious.

792
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:54,515
When I say go, walk down with fire
in your eyes and murder on your mind.

793
00:59:54,649 --> 00:59:55,847
Wet your lips.

794
00:59:56,275 --> 01:00:00,107
You're Isolde. You're a queen.
Now, go, go, go!

795
01:00:01,363 --> 01:00:03,901
You're furious at Tristan.

796
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:05,656
That's great.

797
01:00:19,379 --> 01:00:21,537
Today,
you're just a simple little girl.

798
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:25,504
You live on the Seine, and you're
trying to catch a fish for lunch.

799
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:29,672
Jo, fish. I want you
to look like you're fishing.

800
01:00:29,805 --> 01:00:32,592
I'm trying,
but I've never fished before.

801
01:00:32,724 --> 01:00:36,508
That's quite obvious. You might
just as well be flying a kite.

802
01:00:37,646 --> 01:00:39,603
Don't look like such an amateur.

803
01:00:39,773 --> 01:00:41,184
You're just not fishing.

804
01:00:41,316 --> 01:00:44,400
I am, but it's caught on something.

805
01:00:44,528 --> 01:00:46,899
Well, give it a yank.

806
01:00:47,030 --> 01:00:49,069
Pretend you caught a fish.
Pull it out.

807
01:00:50,575 --> 01:00:52,152
Marvellous!

808
01:00:55,788 --> 01:01:00,449
- Here's what I want you to be.
- I know. I'm a princess at a ball.

809
01:01:00,584 --> 01:01:04,830
The bird is Prince Charming,
turned into a bird by a sorcerer.

810
01:01:04,962 --> 01:01:07,536
But we've decided
not to let it spoil the ball

811
01:01:07,673 --> 01:01:10,674
and to go on dancing
as if nothing had happened.

812
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,425
You've outgrown me.

813
01:01:13,512 --> 01:01:16,631
Alright. Now, give him a kiss.

814
01:01:17,098 --> 01:01:20,514
He's your Prince Charming, isn't he?
Well, get happy!

815
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:23,055
That's a killer.

816
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,890
Alright, Marcel, lights!

817
01:01:33,154 --> 01:01:36,025
Jo! Jo, where are you?

818
01:01:37,074 --> 01:01:39,779
Tell me when you're ready. Say "go".

819
01:01:39,910 --> 01:01:42,152
I'm ready. What are you gonna do?

820
01:01:42,287 --> 01:01:45,656
Never mind what I'm going to do.
Just say "go".

821
01:01:46,416 --> 01:01:47,744
Alright. Go!

822
01:01:51,254 --> 01:01:54,420
Holy Moses! You look fabulous!

823
01:01:54,548 --> 01:01:55,746
Look, stop.

824
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:57,665
Stop!

825
01:01:57,801 --> 01:02:02,048
- I can't stop. Take the picture.
- Stop!

826
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:06,094
I don't want to stop. I like it.
Take the picture.

827
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:30,445
This is your wedding day,
the happiest day of your life.

828
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:33,914
Bells are ringing, flowers blooming,
angels singing.

829
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:38,538
The man you love more than anyone
is inside the church waiting for you.

830
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,500
What's the matter?

831
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,586
I just feel so dishonest
in this wedding dress.

832
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:50,049
It's not the happiest day of my life.
No one's waiting for me anywhere.

833
01:02:50,182 --> 01:02:54,310
But you weren't Anna Karenina.
The bird wasn't Prince Charming.

834
01:02:54,436 --> 01:02:56,761
- Please, Dick.
- I don't understand.

835
01:02:56,897 --> 01:02:58,521
Yes, I know.

836
01:02:58,648 --> 01:03:01,104
Oh, mais quelle mariée charmante!

837
01:03:01,234 --> 01:03:04,685
On ne m'avait pas dit qu'il y aurait
un mariage aujourd'hui.

838
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:05,935
Mais entrez donc.

839
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:08,147
But, Padre, we're not here to marry.

840
01:03:08,282 --> 01:03:12,030
- Such a beautiful bride.
- This is not my dress.

841
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,868
We're here to take pictures.

842
01:03:13,995 --> 01:03:18,040
Nous sommes ici pour photographie,
pour la magazine de la fashion.

843
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:21,415
I'm sorry. Perhaps we should've
asked your permission first.

844
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:24,544
No wedding? Quel dommage!

845
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,213
Merci.

846
01:03:27,549 --> 01:03:28,545
Jo!

847
01:03:33,888 --> 01:03:35,465
Jo?

848
01:03:38,517 --> 01:03:41,850
I'm sorry. I don't know
what's the matter with me.

849
01:03:41,979 --> 01:03:45,561
Forget it and relax.
We've been working too hard.

850
01:03:45,690 --> 01:03:48,181
I suppose we'll be going home soon?

851
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:50,191
That's it. You're homesick.

852
01:03:50,319 --> 01:03:54,364
Well, just this last picture,
then you'll be through.

853
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:57,609
- And then what happens?
- We go home.

854
01:03:58,327 --> 01:03:59,358
And then?

855
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,614
What do you mean?

856
01:04:01,746 --> 01:04:03,537
Will I see you any more?

857
01:04:03,665 --> 01:04:06,998
And how! If you model,
I can get you bookings.

858
01:04:07,126 --> 01:04:10,577
- We'd be working together every day.
- I'll model.

859
01:04:10,713 --> 01:04:12,670
Good. We'll put you to work.

860
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,297
Stand here, please.
There's a good place. Fine.

861
01:04:19,762 --> 01:04:20,758
Lovely.

862
01:04:20,888 --> 01:04:23,842
Now, tip your head just a little bit.

863
01:04:24,850 --> 01:04:27,175
Good. A little smile.

864
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,059
Jo.

865
01:04:33,108 --> 01:04:34,139
Yes?

866
01:04:35,068 --> 01:04:36,645
Something is wrong.

867
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:39,319
No. Why?

868
01:04:39,447 --> 01:04:42,117
You're the saddest bride
I've ever seen.

869
01:04:42,242 --> 01:04:44,483
You look as if you've been jilted.

870
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,695
This is your wedding day.

871
01:04:46,829 --> 01:04:50,778
The day you've dreamt of.
You're marrying the man you love.

872
01:04:50,916 --> 01:04:52,873
The man who loves you.

873
01:04:53,919 --> 01:04:55,117
He's the only...

874
01:04:56,213 --> 01:04:57,790
And you're...

875
01:05:06,555 --> 01:05:09,721
Dick, I thought
it would never happen.

876
01:05:11,226 --> 01:05:14,641
I never want to go home.
I love Paris!

877
01:05:14,771 --> 01:05:18,934
I love these clothes and
the little church. And I love you.

878
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:24,609
What did you say?

879
01:05:24,738 --> 01:05:26,896
I love Paris.

880
01:05:27,032 --> 01:05:28,823
That's not what I heard.

881
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:33,078
My, my, my...!

882
01:05:35,873 --> 01:05:37,664
Well, what do you know!

883
01:05:39,668 --> 01:05:41,127
¶ He loves

884
01:05:42,087 --> 01:05:43,878
¶ And she loves

885
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:46,832
¶ And they love

886
01:05:47,383 --> 01:05:51,795
¶ So why can't... you love

887
01:05:52,179 --> 01:05:57,137
¶ And I love too?

888
01:05:59,853 --> 01:06:01,596
¶ Birds love

889
01:06:01,729 --> 01:06:03,852
¶ And bees love

890
01:06:04,774 --> 01:06:08,522
¶ And whispering trees love

891
01:06:09,445 --> 01:06:11,236
¶ And that's what

892
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,862
¶ We both should do

893
01:06:19,745 --> 01:06:23,790
¶ I always knew someday

894
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:27,829
¶ You'd come along

895
01:06:28,920 --> 01:06:32,668
¶ We'll make a twosome

896
01:06:33,549 --> 01:06:37,214
¶ That just can't go wrong

897
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:40,218
¶ Darling

898
01:06:42,057 --> 01:06:43,885
¶ He loves

899
01:06:44,727 --> 01:06:46,518
¶ And she loves

900
01:06:46,645 --> 01:06:48,934
¶ And they love

901
01:06:49,064 --> 01:06:53,690
¶ So won't you love me

902
01:06:54,653 --> 01:07:01,271
¶ As I love you?

903
01:10:25,759 --> 01:10:28,214
Armande, let me see
a breeze in the trees.

904
01:10:28,344 --> 01:10:31,215
Not too much.
I don't want a cyclone.

905
01:10:31,347 --> 01:10:32,806
Fountains.

906
01:10:34,642 --> 01:10:37,595
It's thrilling!
It makes me cry for the Carolines.

907
01:10:37,728 --> 01:10:40,265
The correspondent from Pakistan
has accepted.

908
01:10:40,397 --> 01:10:43,433
The correspondent from Madrid
will be able to make it.

909
01:10:43,566 --> 01:10:46,602
And the man from Istanbul
will be at the presentation.

910
01:10:46,736 --> 01:10:48,694
Good. Now, where is Jo?

911
01:10:49,364 --> 01:10:50,443
Here she is.

912
01:10:50,573 --> 01:10:53,325
Thank heavens.
I thought you'd stand us up again.

913
01:10:53,451 --> 01:10:56,156
- How did the wedding pictures go?
- Wonderfully.

914
01:10:56,287 --> 01:10:58,160
He is a marvellous photographer.

915
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:02,368
All you do is sit there.
I make my speech to the press,

916
01:11:02,501 --> 01:11:05,418
the curtains will open
and you dazzle 'em!

917
01:11:05,545 --> 01:11:07,870
- Give 'em the old pizzazz.
- I'll try.

918
01:11:08,006 --> 01:11:10,331
I will introduce you to them.

919
01:11:10,466 --> 01:11:12,755
Be charming
and answer their questions.

920
01:11:12,885 --> 01:11:16,301
- What sort of questions?
- It's remarkably simple.

921
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,837
I've written editorials on it
for years.

922
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,717
As one lady to another...

923
01:11:20,851 --> 01:11:23,472
We ought to look like
one lady to another.

924
01:11:23,603 --> 01:11:26,176
They'll want to know
who does your hair,

925
01:11:26,314 --> 01:11:29,231
what you eat, drink,
what sheets you sleep on.

926
01:11:29,358 --> 01:11:32,312
You're the authority
on how to be lovely.

927
01:11:32,444 --> 01:11:34,271
What am I going to tell them?

928
01:11:34,404 --> 01:11:36,527
Just listen and repeat after me.

929
01:11:37,365 --> 01:11:40,485
¶ On how to be lovely

930
01:11:40,618 --> 01:11:43,738
¶ You gotta be happy

931
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:45,863
¶ When you can feel light and gay

932
01:11:45,998 --> 01:11:49,782
¶ Then you'll be lovely as a holiday

933
01:11:50,085 --> 01:11:53,002
¶ On how to be charming

934
01:11:53,213 --> 01:11:56,000
¶ You gotta be merry

935
01:11:56,132 --> 01:11:58,421
¶ If only to weave a spell

936
01:11:58,551 --> 01:12:03,212
¶ And you'll be
Iovely as a carousel, too

937
01:12:04,890 --> 01:12:07,760
¶ I know you can show how

938
01:12:07,893 --> 01:12:10,727
¶ It's all in the know-how

939
01:12:10,853 --> 01:12:13,890
¶ And once you know, oh how

940
01:12:14,023 --> 01:12:15,647
¶ The world looks good to you

941
01:12:15,775 --> 01:12:17,684
¶ As it should to you

942
01:12:18,360 --> 01:12:21,147
¶ On how to be lovely

943
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:24,482
¶ You gotta be jolly

944
01:12:24,616 --> 01:12:26,276
¶ When you can be fancy-free

945
01:12:26,743 --> 01:12:31,203
¶ And flash a smile that folks
come flocking to see

946
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:37,248
¶ You'll be as lovely as can be

947
01:13:07,447 --> 01:13:10,447
¶ Can't do it with make-up

948
01:13:10,574 --> 01:13:13,148
¶ You just gotta wake up

949
01:13:13,994 --> 01:13:16,366
¶ And starting to take up

950
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:18,158
¶ The life delirious

951
01:13:18,582 --> 01:13:20,159
¶ Nothing serious

952
01:13:20,708 --> 01:13:23,911
¶ On how to be lovely

953
01:13:24,045 --> 01:13:26,666
¶ You gotta be cheery

954
01:13:26,797 --> 01:13:29,086
¶ I'll give you a guarantee

955
01:13:29,216 --> 01:13:31,007
¶ You don't need dough

956
01:13:31,134 --> 01:13:34,135
¶ You don't need a college degree

957
01:13:36,056 --> 01:13:39,424
¶ Make sorrow incidental

958
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:42,096
¶ Let joy be monumental

959
01:13:42,228 --> 01:13:46,723
¶ And you'll be lovely

960
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,778
¶ You'll be as lovely as can be

961
01:14:09,419 --> 01:14:11,494
Ah, beautiful!

962
01:14:12,672 --> 01:14:14,249
Beautiful!

963
01:14:14,381 --> 01:14:15,959
These are not my clothes.

964
01:14:16,091 --> 01:14:19,709
They were lent for tonight.
I'm being presented to the press.

965
01:14:19,845 --> 01:14:22,845
Alors! Your picture will be
in all the newspapers?

966
01:14:22,972 --> 01:14:23,968
Oh, yes.

967
01:14:24,098 --> 01:14:27,134
And they'll ask me
all sorts of questions.

968
01:14:27,268 --> 01:14:28,382
Oh!

969
01:14:28,519 --> 01:14:32,599
I think perhaps you had better stay
here with me, huh?

970
01:14:33,649 --> 01:14:34,644
Hello!

971
01:14:37,068 --> 01:14:39,524
Don't you remember me?
Jo Stockton?

972
01:14:39,654 --> 01:14:40,982
C'est Jo!

973
01:14:41,114 --> 01:14:44,482
On vous a manqué, mais on n'a pas
le temps de s'arrêter maintenant.

974
01:14:44,617 --> 01:14:47,487
Flostre part au café
et on est déjà en retard. Au revoir.

975
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:50,620
What were they saying about Flostre?

976
01:14:50,747 --> 01:14:54,959
That he is speaking at the café
and that they are late.

977
01:15:08,139 --> 01:15:10,380
Mr Avery will be by in five minutes.

978
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:13,007
Ask him to pick me up at the café.

979
01:15:19,774 --> 01:15:21,482
Vous retrouverez tout cela

980
01:15:21,609 --> 01:15:23,317
à travers tous mes écrits
sur I'empathicalisme.

981
01:15:23,444 --> 01:15:26,361
La spiritualité
inhérente à I'empathicalisme

982
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:30,652
matérialise les plus nobles aspects
de la nature humaine.

983
01:15:30,784 --> 01:15:32,741
Consciemment ou inconsciemment,

984
01:15:32,869 --> 01:15:35,739
elle est perceptible
dans tout ce qui nous touche.

985
01:15:35,872 --> 01:15:40,414
Dans nos meilleures sculptures...
Et dans notre meilleure littérature.

986
01:15:49,801 --> 01:15:51,176
Pardon, monsieur.

987
01:15:51,302 --> 01:15:54,173
Je suis... terribly sorry.

988
01:15:54,305 --> 01:15:56,878
- I...
- Quite alright, mademoiselle.

989
01:15:57,016 --> 01:15:58,214
You're quite welcome.

990
01:16:01,853 --> 01:16:05,518
Etudiez la statue un instant.
Je reviens tout de suite.

991
01:16:09,235 --> 01:16:10,812
Now, mademoiselle.

992
01:16:10,945 --> 01:16:13,945
I can't believe it.
I thought you'd be old.

993
01:16:14,073 --> 01:16:16,777
Well, I mean, a philosopher
and professor.

994
01:16:16,908 --> 01:16:19,909
It all suggests age.
I mean, maturity.

995
01:16:20,036 --> 01:16:22,029
I'm afraid I've disappointed you.

996
01:16:22,163 --> 01:16:26,741
No. There's no reason why someone
brilliant shouldn't be young.

997
01:16:27,835 --> 01:16:30,539
I find myself
at an awkward disadvantage.

998
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:34,086
You know who I am.

999
01:16:35,050 --> 01:16:39,378
But except that you are
very charming, I don't know you.

1000
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:43,343
I'm so excited about meeting you,
I forgot to introduce myself.

1001
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:46,677
If only you knew how anxious I am
to talk to you.

1002
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:49,645
I came from New York
just to see you.

1003
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:53,720
You couldn't have a more loyal
disciple of empathicalism than I.

1004
01:16:53,858 --> 01:16:58,236
- Than whom?
- I'm sorry. I'm Jo Stockton.

1005
01:16:59,072 --> 01:17:02,108
I'm enchanted,... Miss Stockton.

1006
01:17:03,993 --> 01:17:08,619
And since you've come such a long way
to talk with me,

1007
01:17:08,747 --> 01:17:11,238
by all means, let us talk.

1008
01:17:17,338 --> 01:17:19,876
..there's so much
you can teach us.

1009
01:17:20,007 --> 01:17:22,000
I may go next year.

1010
01:17:22,134 --> 01:17:25,669
You must see Greenwich Village.
It's our Left Bank.

1011
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:29,089
People there think, and do things.
Useful things.

1012
01:17:29,224 --> 01:17:32,225
- Do you live in Greenwich Village?
- Of course.

1013
01:17:32,352 --> 01:17:36,515
Then I will come. Perhaps we can do
useful things together.

1014
01:17:36,647 --> 01:17:40,098
I'm sure that in all America
there's no empathicalist

1015
01:17:40,234 --> 01:17:41,858
as charming as you.

1016
01:17:41,985 --> 01:17:44,310
Well, I hate to throw
a wet blanket...

1017
01:17:44,446 --> 01:17:47,400
Darling, guess who this is.
You'll never guess!

1018
01:17:47,532 --> 01:17:50,201
- Your brother?
- Professor Flostre.

1019
01:17:50,326 --> 01:17:54,904
- This is Dick Avery.
- Professor? I thought you'd be old.

1020
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,123
- So did I. Aren't you surprised?
- I'm overcome.

1021
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:02,081
For you, my dear,
I promise never to grow old.

1022
01:18:02,212 --> 01:18:04,619
- Come on, Jo.
- What's the matter?

1023
01:18:04,756 --> 01:18:06,547
We've got to get to Duval's.

1024
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:09,544
Must you go?
I was just beginning to know you.

1025
01:18:09,677 --> 01:18:12,880
Couldn't I stay?
The professor wants to talk to me.

1026
01:18:13,013 --> 01:18:16,547
- You've heard it all before.
- Have you lost your mind?

1027
01:18:16,683 --> 01:18:19,637
- We'll talk about that later.
- What are you doing?

1028
01:18:19,769 --> 01:18:22,770
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life!

1029
01:18:22,897 --> 01:18:26,100
What's got into you?
Have you any idea...

1030
01:18:29,987 --> 01:18:32,062
How could you be so rude?

1031
01:18:32,197 --> 01:18:35,032
Embarrassing me
in front of Professor Flostre!

1032
01:18:35,158 --> 01:18:37,399
What am I going to tell him?

1033
01:18:37,535 --> 01:18:41,781
You're not gonna tell him anything.
You'll never see him again.

1034
01:18:41,914 --> 01:18:45,080
- Not going to see him again?
- That's what I said.

1035
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:47,331
Now, just a moment...

1036
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:50,876
I went through all this nonsense
to meet this man.

1037
01:18:51,005 --> 01:18:52,630
So I could talk to him.

1038
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:58,216
I worship everything he stands for.
The way he thinks.

1039
01:18:58,346 --> 01:19:01,133
You might as well tell me
never to eat again.

1040
01:19:01,933 --> 01:19:05,183
The Herald Tribune has brought
a correspondent from Sweden.

1041
01:19:05,311 --> 01:19:07,552
- The more the merrier.
- They are here.

1042
01:19:07,688 --> 01:19:10,226
Get them quiet, Duval.
I'll be back.

1043
01:19:10,357 --> 01:19:14,354
When a man looks at a woman
the way Flostre looks at you...

1044
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:23,318
If you weren't so serious,
this would be terribly funny.

1045
01:19:23,452 --> 01:19:26,287
I'll check the lights,
then I make my speech.

1046
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:27,788
Everybody, ready!

1047
01:19:27,914 --> 01:19:29,823
Flostre may be the quiz kid,

1048
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:32,793
the greatest philosopher
since Aristotle.

1049
01:19:32,919 --> 01:19:36,418
But he's also a man.
He's more man than philosopher!

1050
01:19:36,547 --> 01:19:39,548
His interest in me
is anything but intellectual?

1051
01:19:39,675 --> 01:19:42,166
He's as interested in your intellect
as I am.

1052
01:19:43,595 --> 01:19:46,679
Ladies and gentlemen of the press,
my friends.

1053
01:19:46,806 --> 01:19:50,673
I have asked you here to meet
the woman selected to represent

1054
01:19:50,810 --> 01:19:54,937
the most discriminating
publication in the world, Quality.

1055
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:57,471
Let's forget it
and get this over with.

1056
01:19:57,607 --> 01:19:58,722
Forget it?

1057
01:19:58,859 --> 01:20:02,192
Attack Flostre and you attack
the things I believe in.

1058
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:05,274
We're fortunate to have found out
these things now.

1059
01:20:05,406 --> 01:20:07,861
I'm certain you'll not be
disappointed.

1060
01:20:07,992 --> 01:20:11,158
She is a rare creature...
chosen from hundreds

1061
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:14,869
for her appearance, her grace,
her poise...

1062
01:20:14,998 --> 01:20:17,868
and her ineffable charm.

1063
01:20:18,001 --> 01:20:20,456
We can never
reconcile our differences.

1064
01:20:20,586 --> 01:20:22,246
They are too elemental.

1065
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:25,546
This is no time
to discuss our differences.

1066
01:20:25,674 --> 01:20:27,583
Please, let's get this show on.

1067
01:20:27,718 --> 01:20:30,802
Yes, the show!
Our personal lives don't matter!

1068
01:20:30,929 --> 01:20:34,712
- Would you please sit down?
- Leave me alone!

1069
01:20:38,769 --> 01:20:41,604
May I present the Quality Woman!

1070
01:21:13,968 --> 01:21:16,541
What does that one say?

1071
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:20,379
They all say the same thing.
Everyone in Paris is laughing.

1072
01:21:20,516 --> 01:21:23,801
- I'm not.
- This is all your fault.

1073
01:21:23,935 --> 01:21:27,719
I know. I said things
I shouldn't have. She got upset.

1074
01:21:27,856 --> 01:21:30,975
- Just a lovers' quarrel.
- A what?

1075
01:21:31,109 --> 01:21:34,062
- You and that girl...
- Why not?

1076
01:21:34,195 --> 01:21:36,483
Impossible!
You're in the fashion world.

1077
01:21:36,613 --> 01:21:39,318
We're cold, artificial
and without sentiment.

1078
01:21:39,449 --> 01:21:42,699
- How can you be in love?
- I'm a black sheep.

1079
01:21:42,827 --> 01:21:46,161
What about my collection?
Without her I cannot show it.

1080
01:21:46,289 --> 01:21:49,408
- The gowns were sewn on her!
- I'm facing ruin!

1081
01:21:49,542 --> 01:21:52,115
She'll show up.
The girl has integrity.

1082
01:21:52,252 --> 01:21:56,250
She's filled with virtues.
Only she's not wasting them on us.

1083
01:21:56,381 --> 01:21:58,836
I went to the café. She isn't there.

1084
01:21:58,967 --> 01:22:00,046
So where is she?

1085
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:03,046
She's at her hotel,
but she won't take messages.

1086
01:22:03,179 --> 01:22:07,342
So I bribed the desk clerk into
Ietting me copy her phone messages.

1087
01:22:08,934 --> 01:22:12,137
"At 10:15, Dick Avery called."

1088
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:14,843
"At 11:30, Dick Avery called."

1089
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:19,850
"At 12:16, Professor Flostre called."

1090
01:22:21,028 --> 01:22:23,649
Lousy, rotten good-for-nothing!

1091
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,982
"Having an evening of international
philosophy, poetry,

1092
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:31,954
song and meditation tonight
at my salon."

1093
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:36,373
"Would be delighted if you would
join us. Émile Flostre."

1094
01:22:36,500 --> 01:22:38,623
That's where she'll be tonight.

1095
01:22:38,752 --> 01:22:40,910
Not showing my collection.
I'm ruined.

1096
01:22:41,046 --> 01:22:43,797
I'll go to Flostre's tonight
and bring her back.

1097
01:22:43,924 --> 01:22:47,506
And take someone who isn't
emotionally involved. Like me.

1098
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:48,880
You'll never get in.

1099
01:22:49,011 --> 01:22:52,961
Empathicalists have a very firm way
with hostile vibrations.

1100
01:22:53,098 --> 01:22:55,969
Let's turn into
a couple of friendly vibrations.

1101
01:22:56,101 --> 01:22:59,552
Until we get in. As they say,
if you can't lick 'em, join 'em.

1102
01:23:08,947 --> 01:23:11,947
- Do I look grubby enough?
- Yeah. How's the beard?

1103
01:23:12,075 --> 01:23:14,151
- Full of pizzazz.
- Come on.

1104
01:23:17,538 --> 01:23:19,198
Oui? Qui est vous?

1105
01:23:19,331 --> 01:23:21,904
Nous sommes voyager ici
pour la meditation.

1106
01:23:22,042 --> 01:23:23,322
Quels noms?

1107
01:23:23,460 --> 01:23:24,456
La.

1108
01:23:24,586 --> 01:23:27,954
Ah! Monsieur et Madame Barker
de Florida.

1109
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:31,876
- Florida.
- That's us. De Tallahassee.

1110
01:23:32,009 --> 01:23:33,468
Bon. Entrez.

1111
01:23:33,594 --> 01:23:35,882
- Come on, sugar.
- Alright, darlin'.

1112
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,555
- Où est Flostre?
- Pourquoi?

1113
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,761
I don't know. I just asked.

1114
01:23:49,566 --> 01:23:52,650
¶ On me demande

1115
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,695
¶ Pourquoi je l'ai tué

1116
01:23:55,822 --> 01:23:57,482
C'est triste!

1117
01:23:57,615 --> 01:24:00,782
- What's the matter?
- The song's a bundle of laughs.

1118
01:24:00,910 --> 01:24:07,030
¶ Un moment de passion engageante
Je le détestais

1119
01:24:07,166 --> 01:24:09,870
She stabbed her lover
because she hated him.

1120
01:24:10,001 --> 01:24:12,575
¶ Mais quand je I'ai vu

1121
01:24:13,546 --> 01:24:17,211
¶ Mort, froid, et massacré

1122
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:20,176
Now that the poor thing is dead...

1123
01:24:20,302 --> 01:24:25,213
¶ Tout d'un coup, je savais bien
Que je l'ai aimé

1124
01:24:25,348 --> 01:24:27,756
Now that he's dead, she loves him.

1125
01:24:28,935 --> 01:24:30,844
¶ Ma tête éclate

1126
01:24:31,521 --> 01:24:36,431
¶ Je suis complètement dérangée

1127
01:24:36,567 --> 01:24:39,402
This kid's a little confused.

1128
01:24:39,528 --> 01:24:41,650
¶ Et maintenant

1129
01:24:41,780 --> 01:24:44,068
¶ Il n'y a plus rien

1130
01:24:44,199 --> 01:24:46,274
¶ Il n'y a qu'un seul remède

1131
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:48,069
Now she's gonna get even.

1132
01:24:48,202 --> 01:24:51,737
- ¶ Je vais me jeter sur la rue
- She's gonna kill herself.

1133
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:53,911
¶ Corbillard

1134
01:24:57,127 --> 01:24:59,166
C'est tragique!

1135
01:24:59,295 --> 01:25:02,000
- C'est tragique!
- You can say that again.

1136
01:25:02,131 --> 01:25:03,045
Hey!

1137
01:25:08,638 --> 01:25:10,180
Look up the airstay.

1138
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,678
We're on the wrong floor.

1139
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:16,435
Un moment, s'il vous plaît.

1140
01:25:16,562 --> 01:25:19,598
Suivez moi.
Il me semble qu'il y a une erreur.

1141
01:25:19,731 --> 01:25:22,518
Il y a un autre couple
qui s'appelle Barker de Florida.

1142
01:25:22,651 --> 01:25:24,726
Oh-oh, the real Barkers.

1143
01:25:24,861 --> 01:25:26,569
Now what's this all about?

1144
01:25:27,321 --> 01:25:31,698
- They are not from Tallahassee!
- They ain't even from Miami.

1145
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:34,530
I've never seen these people
in Tallahassee,

1146
01:25:34,661 --> 01:25:37,911
and I have been in every corner
of Tallahassee.

1147
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:41,704
- Is this some sort of a gag?
- I know who he is!

1148
01:25:41,834 --> 01:25:45,535
- Il est un photographer de fashion.
- Fashion?!

1149
01:25:45,671 --> 01:25:48,292
She's a fashion editor.
Get 'em out!

1150
01:25:48,424 --> 01:25:51,175
At once,
or Mr Flostre will hear about this.

1151
01:25:51,301 --> 01:25:54,836
Now, wait, we're spiritual singers
on a tour and...

1152
01:25:54,971 --> 01:25:57,544
Now the hostile vibrations
have gone...

1153
01:25:57,682 --> 01:25:59,805
Attendez!
We are ready for your show.

1154
01:26:01,018 --> 01:26:04,718
- Command performance!
- Come on, Mama. We're on.

1155
01:26:04,855 --> 01:26:06,894
Let's give 'em the old pizzazz.

1156
01:26:12,904 --> 01:26:15,359
¶ Ring-a dem bells

1157
01:26:16,157 --> 01:26:18,066
¶ Ring-a dem bells

1158
01:26:19,493 --> 01:26:21,201
¶ We is goin'

1159
01:26:21,328 --> 01:26:23,367
¶ Don't know where-a

1160
01:26:23,497 --> 01:26:25,952
¶ All we know is

1161
01:26:26,082 --> 01:26:28,122
¶ It's up there-a

1162
01:26:28,918 --> 01:26:31,207
¶ Somehow we gotta

1163
01:26:31,337 --> 01:26:34,041
¶ Climb that stair-a

1164
01:26:35,215 --> 01:26:37,374
¶ Ring-a dem...

1165
01:26:37,759 --> 01:26:39,799
¶ Ring-a dem...

1166
01:26:40,303 --> 01:26:42,379
¶ Bells

1167
01:26:45,892 --> 01:26:48,596
¶ Come, all you children,
gather around

1168
01:26:48,727 --> 01:26:50,519
¶ Gather around, you children!

1169
01:26:50,646 --> 01:26:55,272
¶ And we will lose
that evil spirit called voodoo

1170
01:26:58,486 --> 01:27:01,024
¶ Nothing but trouble
If he's found you

1171
01:27:01,155 --> 01:27:02,946
¶ If he has found you, children

1172
01:27:03,074 --> 01:27:05,031
¶ But you can chase that hoodoo

1173
01:27:05,159 --> 01:27:07,567
¶ With the dance that you do

1174
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:15,868
¶ Let us lead the way

1175
01:27:16,962 --> 01:27:22,204
¶ Jubilee today

1176
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:26,386
¶ He'll never hound you,
step on the ground you...

1177
01:27:26,512 --> 01:27:27,543
¶ Children!

1178
01:27:32,351 --> 01:27:33,596
¶ Clap your hands

1179
01:27:33,727 --> 01:27:34,841
¶ Slap your thighs

1180
01:27:34,978 --> 01:27:36,602
¶ Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1181
01:27:36,730 --> 01:27:38,769
¶ Everybody come along

1182
01:27:38,898 --> 01:27:41,270
¶ And join the jubilee!

1183
01:27:41,984 --> 01:27:43,229
¶ Clap your hands

1184
01:27:43,361 --> 01:27:44,605
¶ Slap your thighs

1185
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:46,147
¶ Don't you lose time

1186
01:27:46,280 --> 01:27:48,486
¶ Come along
And shake your shoes time

1187
01:27:48,615 --> 01:27:51,699
¶ Now for you and me

1188
01:27:51,910 --> 01:27:53,285
¶ On the sands of time

1189
01:27:53,411 --> 01:27:56,365
¶ You're only a pebble

1190
01:27:56,497 --> 01:28:00,364
¶ Remember trouble must be treated
just like a rebel

1191
01:28:00,501 --> 01:28:01,746
¶ Send it to the devil

1192
01:28:01,877 --> 01:28:03,122
¶ Clap your hands

1193
01:28:03,253 --> 01:28:04,451
¶ Slap your thighs

1194
01:28:04,588 --> 01:28:06,165
¶ Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

1195
01:28:06,298 --> 01:28:11,292
¶ Everybody come along
and join the jubilee!

1196
01:28:11,427 --> 01:28:13,835
¶ So ring-a dem bells

1197
01:28:13,971 --> 01:28:16,213
¶ Ring-a dem bells out

1198
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:19,012
¶ Ring-a them, ring-a them
Ring-a them, ring-a them

1199
01:28:20,018 --> 01:28:21,299
¶ Bells!

1200
01:28:25,732 --> 01:28:28,020
Well, Mr Tallahassee, how we doin'?

1201
01:28:28,150 --> 01:28:32,362
Why, we's the two most friendly
vibrations you ever seen.

1202
01:28:32,738 --> 01:28:35,110
Hey, diddle diddle,
the cat and the fiddle.

1203
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,279
The dish ran away with the spoon.

1204
01:28:40,370 --> 01:28:43,406
Do you know why
a chicken crosses the road?

1205
01:28:43,539 --> 01:28:45,662
No, why does a chicken
cross the road?

1206
01:28:45,791 --> 01:28:48,496
- To get to the second floor!
- You is a genius!

1207
01:28:48,627 --> 01:28:50,620
Roses are red,
the violets are blue,

1208
01:28:50,754 --> 01:28:55,581
the dresses is gotta be showed.
Let's get this show on the road!

1209
01:28:56,342 --> 01:28:59,628
¶ Clap your hands, slap your thighs,
gimme that beat, boy...

1210
01:28:59,762 --> 01:29:02,597
¶ Gimme that, gimme that
crazy knocked-out beat!

1211
01:29:02,723 --> 01:29:05,640
¶ You gotta...
if you wanna get to the promised land

1212
01:29:05,767 --> 01:29:07,511
¶ You gotta clap your hands

1213
01:29:36,212 --> 01:29:39,747
¶ Clap your hands, slap your thighs,
gimme some heat, man!

1214
01:29:39,882 --> 01:29:42,752
¶ Gimme some,
gimme some Dixieland beat!

1215
01:29:42,885 --> 01:29:47,345
¶ When you hear that Dixieland,
you gotta clap your hands

1216
01:29:49,516 --> 01:29:52,682
¶ Clap-a your hands

1217
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:56,345
¶ Clap-a your hands

1218
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,018
¶ Hallelujah!
Hallelu... Hallelu...

1219
01:29:59,149 --> 01:30:01,818
¶ Hallelujah

1220
01:30:02,277 --> 01:30:09,691
¶ Come along and join ourjubilee!

1221
01:30:22,003 --> 01:30:25,502
Intellectual gratification
is nonexistent.

1222
01:30:25,631 --> 01:30:30,044
- Only you can fulfil that potential.
- This is it.

1223
01:30:31,261 --> 01:30:34,345
- Flostre, there you are.
- Professor, we need you.

1224
01:30:34,473 --> 01:30:38,173
What are you doing here?
You look ridiculous!

1225
01:30:38,351 --> 01:30:42,051
We've come to see Flostre. Professor,
Maggie and I need guidance.

1226
01:30:42,188 --> 01:30:44,513
We realise what futile lives we lead.

1227
01:30:44,648 --> 01:30:48,183
- When did you realise this?
- Today. At about two o'clock.

1228
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:51,319
- Just after lunch.
- Professor, don't believe them.

1229
01:30:51,446 --> 01:30:54,067
We want to sit at your feet
and learn.

1230
01:30:54,199 --> 01:30:56,903
We sit at your feet,
ignorant, but so willing.

1231
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:58,908
You leave his feet alone.

1232
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:01,408
Professor, they want to make
a fool of you.

1233
01:31:01,538 --> 01:31:04,373
- Are you making a fool of him?
- Me?

1234
01:31:04,499 --> 01:31:08,248
You're making things difficult.
You don't own empathicalism.

1235
01:31:08,378 --> 01:31:10,502
It's in the public domain.

1236
01:31:10,631 --> 01:31:14,213
- Why don't you trust these people?
- Because I know them well.

1237
01:31:14,342 --> 01:31:17,343
I know what they're here for
and it is not guidance.

1238
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:19,759
Don't listen to her, Master. She is but a child.

1239
01:31:19,889 --> 01:31:21,798
They came to see me, not you.

1240
01:31:21,933 --> 01:31:24,767
To get me over to Duval's
to model their collection.

1241
01:31:26,478 --> 01:31:29,894
- I should have known.
- You should've heard what he said.

1242
01:31:30,023 --> 01:31:33,973
If we'd come a few minutes later,
you'd have found out for yourself.

1243
01:31:34,110 --> 01:31:35,770
You've said enough, Mr Avery.

1244
01:31:35,903 --> 01:31:38,939
Not yet. I haven't told you
what a phoney you are.

1245
01:31:39,073 --> 01:31:42,691
- Get out of my house.
- I'm not ready to leave.

1246
01:31:42,826 --> 01:31:45,068
I think I can change your mind.

1247
01:31:45,203 --> 01:31:47,777
Catch!

1248
01:31:47,914 --> 01:31:49,705
Oh! Oh, no!

1249
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:54,290
Look what you've done!
Bursting in here like a hoodlum.

1250
01:31:54,420 --> 01:31:56,745
- I never touched him.
- Go away!

1251
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,667
It's time you woke up
to your responsibilities.

1252
01:31:59,800 --> 01:32:01,543
Will you please leave?

1253
01:32:01,676 --> 01:32:04,677
Duval can't show his collection
without you.

1254
01:32:04,804 --> 01:32:07,377
You can't do this to him,
or to all the others.

1255
01:32:07,515 --> 01:32:08,629
Hundreds of people.

1256
01:32:08,849 --> 01:32:11,008
I'm not interested in your people.

1257
01:32:11,143 --> 01:32:15,603
- Your empathy is a little one-sided.
- Get out!

1258
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:16,810
Alright!

1259
01:32:17,691 --> 01:32:19,517
I assume you mean me, too.

1260
01:32:20,318 --> 01:32:22,524
On you it looks cute, sugar.

1261
01:32:27,741 --> 01:32:29,781
Well, you fixed everything!

1262
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:33,907
If you can't lick 'em, join 'em
and if you can't join 'em, lick 'em!

1263
01:32:34,039 --> 01:32:36,529
- Tell Duval I'm sorry.
- Where are you going?

1264
01:32:36,666 --> 01:32:40,200
There's a plane to New York
at 10:30 p.m. and I'm on it.

1265
01:32:41,045 --> 01:32:43,915
You can't do this to me! Come back!

1266
01:32:44,048 --> 01:32:48,590
How dare you leave me in the street
Iike this! Taxi!

1267
01:32:59,561 --> 01:33:02,515
- Have they gone?
- They've gone.

1268
01:33:02,648 --> 01:33:05,897
- And you're still here?
- I'm still here.

1269
01:33:06,026 --> 01:33:07,982
Are you alright?

1270
01:33:08,111 --> 01:33:09,273
Well.

1271
01:33:09,987 --> 01:33:13,653
In fact, I feel wonderful.

1272
01:33:15,035 --> 01:33:17,442
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1273
01:33:17,579 --> 01:33:21,907
I had no idea they were coming,
or what got into Dick.

1274
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:27,117
My dear, you mustn't assume guilt
for something that was unavoidable.

1275
01:33:28,171 --> 01:33:29,879
They've gone.

1276
01:33:31,091 --> 01:33:35,088
You are here.
That's all that matters now.

1277
01:33:35,219 --> 01:33:38,090
Nice of you to say so,
but it was me...

1278
01:33:38,222 --> 01:33:40,926
You have the most penetrating eyes.

1279
01:33:41,058 --> 01:33:43,727
I can still see them
when I close mine.

1280
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:45,643
- Professor?
- Call me Émile.

1281
01:33:45,770 --> 01:33:48,937
Would there be any value
in my contacting philosophers

1282
01:33:49,065 --> 01:33:52,231
in cities like
Omaha and Detroit and...

1283
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:55,064
and acquainting them
with empathicalism?

1284
01:33:55,195 --> 01:33:58,564
Your mouth suggests to me
burgundy velvet.

1285
01:33:58,699 --> 01:34:03,609
Dr Post, who runs a shop I worked in,
has contacts in several universities.

1286
01:34:03,745 --> 01:34:05,536
Please.

1287
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:10,117
Don't say another word.

1288
01:34:10,251 --> 01:34:13,335
- But I came here to talk.
- We'll talk.

1289
01:34:13,462 --> 01:34:16,830
- Later.
- Why don't I come back later?

1290
01:34:16,965 --> 01:34:18,423
But I need you now.

1291
01:34:19,217 --> 01:34:22,632
Professor Flostre, I came to talk
with a philosopher.

1292
01:34:22,762 --> 01:34:25,335
You're talking like a man.

1293
01:34:25,472 --> 01:34:28,592
But I am a man. And you're a woman.

1294
01:34:28,767 --> 01:34:31,174
That's not what I came
to talk about.

1295
01:34:31,311 --> 01:34:32,770
My dear.

1296
01:34:35,773 --> 01:34:38,857
There is a magical moment
waiting for us.

1297
01:34:38,984 --> 01:34:42,934
- Don't come any closer.
- Why are you behaving like this?

1298
01:34:43,071 --> 01:34:47,780
- You come from Greenwich Village.
- I'm moving uptown. Yonkers.

1299
01:34:47,909 --> 01:34:49,533
But before you move...

1300
01:35:03,465 --> 01:35:07,082
I cannot keep them waiting.
I must make an announcement.

1301
01:35:07,218 --> 01:35:10,717
- What shall I say?
- Tell them it was all my fault.

1302
01:35:22,733 --> 01:35:24,476
Maggie, where's Dick?

1303
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:28,274
You told him to go and he went.
He flies at 10:30 p.m.

1304
01:35:28,405 --> 01:35:29,567
He mustn't!

1305
01:35:29,697 --> 01:35:31,904
I knew you would not let us down!

1306
01:35:32,033 --> 01:35:35,651
- You must do the collection!
- Later. I've got to get to Dick.

1307
01:35:35,786 --> 01:35:38,703
- We are so late already.
- I want to help.

1308
01:35:38,831 --> 01:35:42,116
I know how you feel,
even if you think I don't.

1309
01:35:42,250 --> 01:35:46,912
- I can put myself in your place.
- Maggie, that's empathy!

1310
01:35:47,046 --> 01:35:50,497
That's what you've been talking
about! Why didn't you say?

1311
01:35:50,633 --> 01:35:53,918
Get to work. I'll take care
of Dick. Leave it to me!

1312
01:35:54,053 --> 01:35:56,970
Lettie, what is the name
of Dick Avery's hotel?

1313
01:35:57,097 --> 01:35:59,848
- Le Savoyard.
- Get me the number.

1314
01:35:59,974 --> 01:36:03,177
- How long before we can begin?
- We're ready.

1315
01:36:05,646 --> 01:36:07,306
Messieurs et mesdames.

1316
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:10,974
We are proud to bring you
a new collection by Paul Duval,

1317
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:13,149
inspired by the Quality Woman,

1318
01:36:13,278 --> 01:36:17,738
chosen to represent a great American
fashion magazine, Quality.

1319
01:36:17,865 --> 01:36:20,072
We begin with Hors d'Oeuvre.

1320
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:36,873
Hotel Savoyard?
M. Dick Avery, s'il vous plaît?

1321
01:36:43,764 --> 01:36:48,674
- Monsieur, your bill is ready.
- I know. 352,428 francs.

1322
01:36:48,810 --> 01:36:51,810
- Merci, monsieur. Come back soon.
- Thank you.

1323
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:56,847
He doesn't answer, madame.
I will give you the desk.

1324
01:36:58,735 --> 01:37:02,779
Hello. Monsieur Avery?
He just left.

1325
01:37:02,906 --> 01:37:05,443
Well, run out and get him!
It's urgent!

1326
01:37:06,242 --> 01:37:07,440
Oui, madame.

1327
01:37:10,621 --> 01:37:12,946
I'm so sorry. It was too late.

1328
01:37:27,762 --> 01:37:31,759
- Did you get him?
- No. We'll get him at the airport.

1329
01:37:31,891 --> 01:37:34,464
- I can't find it!
- How are you spelling it?

1330
01:37:34,602 --> 01:37:37,175
- A-U-L-Y.
- Orly. O-R-L-Y.

1331
01:37:37,312 --> 01:37:39,803
- You were there!
- I'm just so nervous.

1332
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,932
- Are you ready?
- Just about.

1333
01:37:42,067 --> 01:37:44,736
Monsieurs et mesdames, Jonquille.

1334
01:37:44,861 --> 01:37:45,940
I'm ready.

1335
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:55,784
You can board your plane now,
monsieur. Pleasant flight.

1336
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:56,943
Thanks.

1337
01:38:01,292 --> 01:38:03,331
Attention! Attention!

1338
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:07,244
Monsieur Avery?
Monsieur Richard Avery?

1339
01:38:07,381 --> 01:38:09,338
Maggie, is there any news?

1340
01:38:09,466 --> 01:38:13,594
They promised they'd get my message
to him before he boarded.

1341
01:38:15,888 --> 01:38:17,133
It's too late.

1342
01:38:17,265 --> 01:38:21,344
The clock must be fast.
He just hasn't got the message yet.

1343
01:38:31,277 --> 01:38:34,860
I'm sure he got it.
He didn't want to talk to me.

1344
01:38:37,533 --> 01:38:40,070
I don't blame him.
I hurt him too much.

1345
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:51,542
And now, the finale
of the collection. Wedding Day.

1346
01:39:03,139 --> 01:39:05,013
What a beautiful bride!

1347
01:39:05,141 --> 01:39:07,180
Yes. Pity it isn't her wedding.

1348
01:39:25,201 --> 01:39:26,446
Professor!

1349
01:39:26,578 --> 01:39:28,404
Keep away from me, you!

1350
01:39:28,538 --> 01:39:31,953
If you lay one finger on me,
I will call your embassy.

1351
01:39:32,082 --> 01:39:35,700
I want to apologise.
She wasn't worth fighting about.

1352
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:38,587
- Don't tell me I did that!
- You?

1353
01:39:38,713 --> 01:39:41,121
You didn't even give me a headache.

1354
01:39:41,257 --> 01:39:44,957
She did this to me, with a statue
that cost 200,000 francs.

1355
01:39:45,094 --> 01:39:48,545
- She did that?
- I have 18 stitches in my head.

1356
01:39:48,681 --> 01:39:51,254
- She gave you 18 stitches?
- And a gashed lip.

1357
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:53,051
And six stitches in my ear.

1358
01:39:53,185 --> 01:39:56,304
Professor, I love every broken bone
in your body!

1359
01:40:01,776 --> 01:40:04,527
Excuse me, Duval. Where is Jo?

1360
01:40:04,653 --> 01:40:07,322
She was magnificent!
You should've seen her!

1361
01:40:07,447 --> 01:40:10,365
- Where is she?
- I don't know, she was here...

1362
01:40:10,492 --> 01:40:12,568
Lettie! Have you seen Jo?

1363
01:40:12,702 --> 01:40:15,619
No, I...
Oh, Dick, she was just great!

1364
01:40:15,746 --> 01:40:18,154
Maggie, where's Jo?
Have you seen her?

1365
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:20,366
She was here, but she's disappeared.

1366
01:40:20,501 --> 01:40:23,335
- Did she say where she was going?
- I understand now.

1367
01:40:23,462 --> 01:40:26,628
She put herself in your place,
so put yourself in her place.

1368
01:40:26,756 --> 01:40:29,164
You'll meet each other
in somebody's place.

1369
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:32,217
That's it!
Maggie, you ought to be president.

1370
01:40:32,345 --> 01:40:33,755
I thought I was!

1371
01:41:00,078 --> 01:41:05,866
¶ I love your funny face

1372
01:41:07,334 --> 01:41:11,628
¶ Your sunny, funny...

1373
01:41:24,225 --> 01:41:27,808
- ¶ 'S wonderful
- ¶ 'S wonderful

1374
01:41:27,979 --> 01:41:31,561
- ¶ 'S marvellous
- ¶ 'S marvellous

1375
01:41:31,690 --> 01:41:33,896
¶ That you should care

1376
01:41:35,068 --> 01:41:37,773
¶ For me

1377
01:41:39,155 --> 01:41:42,654
- ¶ 'S awful nice
- ¶ 'S awful nice

1378
01:41:42,783 --> 01:41:46,697
¶ 'S paradise
¶ 'S paradise

1379
01:41:46,829 --> 01:41:48,905
¶ 'S what I love

1380
01:41:49,831 --> 01:41:51,740
¶ To see

1381
01:41:54,044 --> 01:42:00,580
¶ You've made my life so glamorous

1382
01:42:02,343 --> 01:42:08,096
¶ You can't blame me for feeling
amorous

1383
01:42:09,516 --> 01:42:11,638
¶ Oh, 's wonderful

1384
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:15,684
¶ 'S marvellous

1385
01:42:18,273 --> 01:42:21,724
¶ That you should care

1386
01:42:21,860 --> 01:42:25,193
¶ For me
