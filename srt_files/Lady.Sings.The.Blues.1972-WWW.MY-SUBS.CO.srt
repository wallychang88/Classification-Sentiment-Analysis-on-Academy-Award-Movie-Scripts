1
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,606
<i>All right, Eleanora.</i>

2
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,193
Eleanora.

3
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,741
Miss Holiday.

4
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,162
You better haul
your little black ass in here.

5
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,587
Slow.

6
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:08,266
It's about time.

7
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,479
Girl, if you wants
to lay around all day,

8
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,564
you is in the wrong end
of the business.

9
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,525
When I give it away
for the first time,

10
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,485
it ain't gonna be to no $2 john

11
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,862
in East Baltimore.
That's for damn sure.

12
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,990
At the rate you going, by the time
you decide to give it away,

13
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:26,868
you'll have to pay some john
$2 just to take it.

14
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,704
I's here, y'all. I got my $2.

15
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,289
That's dynamite.

16
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,211
And I see just the woman I want.

17
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:41,049
Come here, baby. Come to Papa.

18
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,010
Got a surprise for you.
I got a surprise for you.

19
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,555
I got a surprise for you, too,
if you don't leave me alone.

20
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,931
- Come here, sweetie.
- What?

21
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,266
Come over here.

22
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:52,435
Let me tell you something. Come on.
Come on. I know. I know. Listen.

23
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,104
I'm trying to talk to this...

24
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:58,984
Now, what do a fine man like you
want with a child like this?

25
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,027
She ain't 15 years old yet.

26
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,988
- What that got to do with anything?
- I know. I know.

27
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,906
I come here to spend my money.

28
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,285
Suppose I take you over here
and show you a real woman

29
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,579
who could give you your money's worth.

30
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,414
No.

31
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:15,709
No, that one's
plenty woman enough for me.

32
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:19,713
Don't try to give me no jive, broad.
I see what I want.

33
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,048
I come here to spend my money.

34
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,509
And I see what I want, and this is it.

35
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,013
- Come on. Come on, now.
- Well, you can't get what you see.

36
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,473
And since you don't want
what you can get,

37
00:06:30,557 --> 00:06:33,685
then you know where you can go,
and this is it.

38
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,271
We don't need his kind, no way.

39
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,649
Imagine him making all that fuss
over one young Kid.

40
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:44,863
- He must have been good and drunk.
- Yeah, drunk or blind. Shit.

41
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,657
All right, honey.
You can go now. That's enough.

42
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:48,909
Honey.

43
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:54,205
You are wearing this thing out
and me with it.

44
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:57,709
Now, why don't you take it with you
and make it a good home?

45
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,835
You mean, I can have it?

46
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:02,297
If you can get out of here with it
before I can count to 10. One,

47
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:06,051
two, three, four,

48
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,847
five, six, seven, eight,

49
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,558
nine, ten.

50
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:59,688
Eleanora. Eleanora.

51
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,607
The good Lord
give you two long legs to run with,

52
00:08:02,691 --> 00:08:04,150
and He give me two strong hands

53
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,153
to beat your black behind blue
the next time you slowpoke home

54
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:08,989
when you know we got
an all-night drive

55
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,991
before we get to Cousin Charlotte's.

56
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,826
- Sorry.
- Now, here.

57
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,745
You take these here keys
and make sure you use them.

58
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:17,205
I don't wanna come back here
Sunday night

59
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:19,082
and find the house all cleaned out.

60
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,419
Talking about cleaning,
you didn't do the steps this week,

61
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,963
and the oven could use
a good scrubbing.

62
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,717
I didn't have time to make the beds,
and there's washing to be put out.

63
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,136
Wave goodbye to your cousin Eleanora.

64
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,892
I'm gonna call Reverend Jones and
make sure you get to church on Sunday.

65
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,104
Now, you be a good girl, Eleanora,
and next time you can come with us.

66
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,065
There's a letter inside
from your mama from New York.

67
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:49,237
And empty out the pan
under the icebox.

68
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,142
<i>Do</i>

69
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:04,813
<i>Want to anyway</i>

70
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,738
<i>I don't care what people say</i>

71
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,371
<i>If I should</i>

72
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,874
<i>Take a notion</i>

73
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:30,505
<i>To jump into the ocean</i>

74
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:35,218
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

75
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,096
<i>If I do</i>

76
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,807
<i>If I do</i>

77
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,019
<i>If my man ain't</i>

78
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:47,981
<i>Got no money</i>

79
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,568
<i>And I say take all...</i>

80
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,779
I's here. Got my $2.

81
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:58,533
It's dynamite. That's dynamite.

82
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,412
Come on, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on.

83
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,081
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

84
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:07,292
I'm not scared of you
'cause you handsome.

85
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,502
- You know what I mean?
- Come on.

86
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:12,881
- Okay, I...
- Come on. Come on.

87
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:15,675
Come on, sweetie, sweetie.
Let me take a look at you.

88
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,719
Oh, my goodness.

89
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,888
Why don't you sit down on the...

90
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,431
- Okay.
- Come on.

91
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:25,560
Okay, wait, wait, wait. Sit down.
You can't do nothing standing up, now.

92
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:27,896
Come on. Sit down. Okay.

93
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:30,690
Now take your hat off,
and rest your coat.

94
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:44,954
Funny girl!
And then the missus woke up

95
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:47,165
and saw
that he hadn't come home all night.

96
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,584
And then wouldn't she hit the ceiling!

97
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,711
Went running all over the place

98
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:54,255
flopping that old yellow nightgown
of hers, you know,

99
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:58,134
and looking for him
and calling, "Charles?

100
00:11:58,218 --> 00:11:59,928
"Charles?"

101
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,182
I sure hope they get their problems
all settled

102
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:06,017
before they get back here
in the morning.

103
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,104
Got my polishing to do. See you, girl.

104
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,202
- This your kid, Sadie?
- Yes, Sir.

105
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,621
You know, she shouldn't
be walking around by herself

106
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,039
in this neighborhood.

107
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,750
- You know what I mean?
- Yes, Sir.

108
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,593
Guess you heard about what happened.

109
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,805
I came all the way from Baltimore
to see you, Ma.

110
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,015
My baby.

111
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,859
Thank you, Mama.

112
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,906
Sure is gonna be great
staying together again, ain't it, Ma?

113
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,909
Ain't it, Ma?

114
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,083
Honey, you know there ain't nothing
your mama wouldn't do for you.

115
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,835
Nothing in the world.

116
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,130
You can stay the night,

117
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,008
but the madam's
coming home in the morning.

118
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:23,886
I understand, Mama.

119
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:28,016
Sister Edson.

120
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:30,893
I bet you if I called her
and asked her...

121
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,186
She's a lady from our church,

122
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,731
and she's always willing to help out
nice, young girls.

123
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,650
And since you're my daughter...

124
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,071
I bet she'd be willing
to let you do some housework

125
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:43,906
for your room and your board.

126
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,790
- I'm sorry, baby.
- It's all right, Mama.

127
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:56,336
Can't fault you
for what ain't your fault.

128
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,338
I'll be all right.

129
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,330
Come in, missy.

130
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:38,294
Excuse me, miss.
Is you "Miss Lorraine Edson,

131
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,381
"290 139th Street, Harlem"?

132
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:45,885
Yes, honey, I sure am.
And you must be Sadie's girl.

133
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,178
Yes, ma'am. I am.

134
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,515
Well, the good Lord's
delivered you safe and sound.

135
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:53,393
My mama told me to say thank you
for taking me in.

136
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,103
And she told me also to tell you

137
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:58,439
that you have
the best rooming house in Harlem,

138
00:14:58,523 --> 00:15:01,025
and that I ain't supposed to be lazy

139
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,860
and I supposed to work real,
real hard.

140
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,489
Well, now,
that's a fine spirit you got, honey.

141
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,576
And I want you
to just make yourself right at home.

142
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,661
Okay.

143
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,580
Rest your things. Look around.
I'll be right back.

144
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:18,501
That's a fine young girl.

145
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,339
Hello?

146
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,258
Yeah, who's this?

147
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:26,509
Who?

148
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:29,554
I don't think I know that name.

149
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:08,718
Well, now, honey, I'll show you
my whole place, upstairs and down.

150
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,428
I don't want to see the upstairs,
Miss Edson,

151
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,181
'cause my Mama told me
you had a job for me as a cleaner.

152
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,308
And that's what I got, missy.

153
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,728
I mean, you're the one
with other things on your mind.

154
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,063
Wishful thinking, I call it.

155
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:24,901
'Cause, girl, let's face it,
you got a long way to go

156
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,321
before you can earn $2
for just 10 minutes of your time,

157
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,531
or ain't you looked
at yourself lately?

158
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,019
That lazy bitch.
She don't look where she's going.

159
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,649
Ain't it a shame how some
of God's children have it so easy

160
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,902
and others have it so hard?

161
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,946
"Ain't it a shame?"

162
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,095
<i>Last night, night before
Two different robbers at my door</i>

163
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,745
Come on. Kid, come on, beat it.

164
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,496
Mister, is the boss around?

165
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,040
You're saying goodbye to him. Bye-bye.

166
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,791
Okay, but, look,
I work in the neighborhood already,

167
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,628
and I'd be willing to quit working
and come up here and work for you.

168
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,546
Yeah, I'd be very happy to quit, too.
Come on, honey.

169
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,673
- But I can sing. I really can.
- Yeah.

170
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:56,469
I can dance, and I know the words
to every song that's out today.

171
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,387
I mean, I've been really rehearsing
and everything.

172
00:18:58,471 --> 00:18:59,930
That's very good. So do I.
But I tell you,

173
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,851
in order to be a showgirl,
you gotta have something to show.

174
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,436
Well, I got something. I really do.

175
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,147
All you have to do is push it up a bit
and put some lip rouge on.

176
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,273
I could do it, mister,
give me a break.

177
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:10,358
Look, really, I'm good.

178
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:11,692
All you have to do
is give me a chance.

179
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,985
Listen, girlie. Listen to me.

180
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,946
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but no amount of slinky

181
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:19,992
and makeup is gonna change you
into a female that looks like...

182
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,455
Like that.

183
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,874
Louis, so good to see you.

184
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,752
I'll get you a great table.
How about a nice table for Mr. McKay?

185
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:34,567
What you looking at?
Don't your mama make you wash steps?

186
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,232
<i>Shake it to the east
Shake it to the west</i>

187
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,485
<i>Shake it to the one
that you love the best</i>

188
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,158
- Now?
- No, not yet, don't you peek, Mama.

189
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:28,954
- Now?
- Not yet.

190
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,627
- Now?
- No.

191
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,421
Now come with me.

192
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,304
Surprise.

193
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,726
Jesus. Lord have mercy.

194
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,313
I ain't never, in my whole life,
seen such a fine hat.

195
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:58,150
Just like them fancy ladies
up on Sugar Hill.

196
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:02,822
Oh, Lord, and just to think
my baby give it to me.

197
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:06,575
Honey, I just loves it.

198
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,703
God bless Sister Edson.

199
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,414
I can see she's doing right by you.

200
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:15,668
Every time you come over here,
you're looking better and better.

201
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,128
Still cleaning and washing,
no cooking yet, huh?

202
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,256
No, not yet.

203
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,966
Hey, Mama, I gotta go.
It's getting late.

204
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,717
I don't wanna miss my train.

205
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:27,555
Honey, I forgot.
I got a surprise for you, too.

206
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,601
I got me a new job starting next week,
and it's gonna be close by you,

207
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,646
and I'll be able to walk over
most evenings, won't that be nice?

208
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,189
And we can visit.

209
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:40,317
That'll be swell, Mama.
That'll be just swell.

210
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:42,945
- Just what we always wanted.
- Yeah.

211
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,781
We'll be able
to spend more time together.

212
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:47,533
That'll be real great.

213
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,327
Lord have mercy.

214
00:22:50,411 --> 00:22:52,746
My baby done made me
so happy this day.

215
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,934
Eleanora, you're late again.

216
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:15,853
Girl, you done missed
two tricks already.

217
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:18,939
You better get the spirit, sister,
and get yourself on up them steps

218
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,025
and quit your lollygagging.

219
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,652
Didn't your mama teach you
how to close doors?

220
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:26,780
If you don't want this job,
somebody else sure do.

221
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,170
You fine, young thing.

222
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,965
You're new in the neighborhood.

223
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,009
So, honey, I gotta love you real good.

224
00:24:30,219 --> 00:24:34,181
Looky here
what Lorraine done sent to me.

225
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,059
I never accomplished any great feats,

226
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:39,186
but you know something, baby?

227
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm something else under them sheets.

228
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:45,150
You see my father was a jockey,
and he taught me how to ride.

229
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:50,364
He said, Big Ben,
you got to get it from side to side.

230
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,409
Now, in case you don't know who I am,

231
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:58,580
I'm Big Ben, baby.
Yeah, the lover-man.

232
00:24:58,664 --> 00:25:02,126
We gonna have ourselves
a ball tonight.

233
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:05,295
Lorraine done sent me
this fine dinner.

234
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:10,968
Young and tender.
This is where her head was.

235
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:13,137
Won't be there when I get through.

236
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:18,684
'Cause, see, I'm from the city,
and I'm gonna kiss your little titty.

237
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,230
Young, and fine, and mellow.

238
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:26,275
Light as a feather.

239
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,068
<i>Big Ben told all his men</i>

240
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,238
<i>Don't you take no numbers
after half past ten</i>

241
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,408
What?
What's the matter with you, woman?

242
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:38,454
Ain't nothing personal, mister,
but I just quit the business.

243
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,666
Hell, bitch, you crazy?
Ain't this a killer?

244
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,751
Lorraine.

245
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,336
Hey, Lorraine. Lorraine.

246
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,172
What's happening?
Who's making all that noise up there?

247
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,424
- He said his name is Big Ben.
- Big Ben?

248
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,593
Ain't you supposed to be upstairs
with Big Ben?

249
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:53,677
I ain't doing it.

250
00:25:53,761 --> 00:25:55,137
What you mean
you ain't doing it, girl?

251
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:58,432
You give my place a bad name.
Big Ben's the best customer I got.

252
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:01,477
You can't do that.
All the girls love Big Ben.

253
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,313
He's my best customer, and I'm trying
to make something out of you.

254
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,274
I sent him up to you.
Now, what's the matter with you, girl?

255
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,484
You better get the spirit, sister,

256
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,486
and get on back upstairs
and do your work.

257
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,529
The Lord knows
I'm trying to help you...

258
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,239
Miss Edson, honey, I done quit.

259
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,407
Done quit?

260
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,951
Well, you get on away
from around here, then.

261
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,036
'Cause you ain't nothing.

262
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,830
You ain't never been nothing,
and you ain't gonna be nothing.

263
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,958
'Cause you don't go messing like that
with Big Ben.

264
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:28,462
- That's right.
- Get your ass back in the house.

265
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,005
- You looking for someone, miss?
- Yes.

266
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,716
I noticed your sign in the window,

267
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,219
and I'm a featured dancer
at a club downtown.

268
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,387
And I don't have much time,

269
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,849
but I happen to live
in the neighborhood.

270
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:25,477
And I'm looking
for something a little closer to home.

271
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,480
So you're a dancer now?

272
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,568
Okay, dancer. Dance.

273
00:28:23,285 --> 00:28:26,079
Yeah, that's fine, girls. Take 10.

274
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:29,583
Thank you, honey. Just real nice.
Beautiful. Wonderful.

275
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,627
I tell you what,
watch your step as you leave.

276
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,921
You know the way out. Be careful.

277
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,631
Hey, baby, you know how to sing?

278
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:38,008
Yeah, I know how to sing,
but he wants a dancer.

279
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,552
You ain't got nothing to lose.
You better try to think up a song.

280
00:28:40,636 --> 00:28:44,014
- I can sing anything. Shoot.
- All right, let's try something.

281
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,474
- What you know?
- But he doesn't like me.

282
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,060
He ain't got nothing to do.
I can handle him. What can you sing?

283
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,812
- I can sing <i>All of Me.</i>
- Jerry, I'm sorry, brother.

284
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:51,897
Just go on.

285
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,649
<i>All of Me</i>, man,
you ain't never heard this like this.

286
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,234
<i>- All Of Me.</i>
- Church, take you home.

287
00:28:55,317 --> 00:28:56,818
This a friend of mine, man,
I didn't...

288
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,029
You gonna love it. Jerry,
you're a good person in your heart.

289
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:03,242
- You know you're gonna love it.
- Okay, okay, let her sing. Sing.

290
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,620
<i>All of me</i>

291
00:29:07,913 --> 00:29:09,122
Ain't Miss Holiday something?

292
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,008
<i>All of me</i>

293
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:26,056
<i>Why not take all of me?</i>

294
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:29,810
<i>Can't you see</i>

295
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:34,523
<i>I'm no good without you</i>

296
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:37,067
<i>Take my lips</i>

297
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,780
<i>I want to lose them</i>

298
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,032
<i>Take my arms</i>

299
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:47,869
<i>I'll never use them</i>

300
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,247
<i>Your goodbye</i>

301
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:54,835
<i>Left me with eyes that cry</i>

302
00:29:54,918 --> 00:30:01,049
<i>How can I go on without you?</i>

303
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,177
<i>You took the part</i>

304
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:07,472
<i>That once was my heart</i>

305
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:13,186
<i>So why not take all of me?</i>

306
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,771
<i>Yeah</i>

307
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:18,066
<i>Take all of me</i>

308
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:26,325
Come on, you girls, come on,
you gotta get dressed.

309
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:29,036
We open in 15 minutes. And you...

310
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,204
Tonight, you get your chance.

311
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,623
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
What'd you say your name was?

312
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:36,043
- Eleanora.
- Ella... Ella who?

313
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:41,673
Billie. Billie Holiday.
Billie Holiday, that's my name.

314
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,508
Okay, Billie.
One of the girls will show you

315
00:30:43,592 --> 00:30:44,926
- where you put your things.
- Okay.

316
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,471
Tonight, all you gotta do is watch
the other singers and do what they do.

317
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,348
Okay, you're an angel, Jerry.

318
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,059
Yeah, wait a minute.
I'll be a bum if you don't pull in

319
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:53,560
15 bucks in tips tonight.

320
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,438
15 bucks. Now, that's my definition
of a good singer.

321
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,023
Okay.

322
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,192
Go on, Billie Holiday.

323
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:10,285
<i>Do you wanna see me</i>

324
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:13,497
<i>Dance right out my shoe</i>

325
00:31:14,498 --> 00:31:18,001
<i>Do you wanna see me</i>

326
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,296
<i>Dance right out my shoe</i>

327
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:25,175
<i>Well, then play that old</i>

328
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:29,137
<i>Low down chopper blues</i>

329
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,601
<i>Yeah</i>

330
00:31:37,938 --> 00:31:40,982
<i>Well, the band starts playing</i>

331
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:44,736
<i>And I lose control</i>

332
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,073
<i>The band starts playing</i>

333
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,951
<i>And I lose control</i>

334
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,911
What you frowning about, baby?

335
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,288
Don't worry about it.
What she miss on the top

336
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:57,207
she can pick up on the bottom.

337
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,668
I hope that works both ways.

338
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,379
Don't worry about it.
One day, she picked the table up.

339
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:12,514
All right, Mama, go ahead.

340
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,141
Next time,
you could pick up the floor.

341
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,976
We don't need a janitor.

342
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:20,063
Go on. Go on. Jerry's watching.
Right there, Jack.

343
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:21,940
Come on, baby.

344
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,151
That's a new girl just breaking in.

345
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:41,835
<i>Someday he'll come along</i>

346
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,128
Yes, sir.

347
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,505
<i>The man I love</i>

348
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:48,425
<i>And he'll be big and strong</i>

349
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,634
Pick it up.

350
00:32:49,718 --> 00:32:51,511
<i>The man I love</i>

351
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:53,013
Pick it up. Come over. Come on.

352
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,932
<i>And when he comes my way</i>

353
00:32:57,267 --> 00:33:02,439
<i>I'll do my best to make him stay</i>

354
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,316
You're pitiful.

355
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:09,529
<i>He'll look at me and smile</i>

356
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,574
<i>I'll understand</i>

357
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,534
Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.

358
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:19,623
<i>Then in a little while
he'll take my hand</i>

359
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:23,335
<i>And though it seems absurd</i>

360
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,962
- Come on. Come on.
- Pick it up.

361
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:27,964
You think you're too good
to pick up money?

362
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,593
- Want me to put my foot in your ass?
- Would you shut up?

363
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:38,099
<i>Maybe he'll come Sunday</i>

364
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,853
<i>Maybe Monday</i>

365
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:44,356
You gotta do better than that, hon.

366
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,732
<i>Maybe not</i>

367
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,692
Go. Get it. Get it.

368
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,364
<i>Still I'm sure he'll come one day</i>

369
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,659
<i>Maybe Tuesday</i>

370
00:33:55,742 --> 00:34:00,288
<i>Will be my good news day</i>

371
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:04,084
<i>He'll build a little home</i>

372
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:08,213
<i>Just meant for two</i>

373
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,882
<i>From which I'll never roam</i>

374
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:14,052
Take the money. Come on,
I can do better than that myself.

375
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,806
<i>And so all else above</i>

376
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,057
Go ahead, pick it on up.

377
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,143
<i>I'm dreaming of</i>

378
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:28,525
<i>The man I love</i>

379
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:40,537
Schmuck. Me and my big heart,
and you and your friends.

380
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,957
- Who does she think she is?
- A lady. With a hell of a voice.

381
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,126
We ain't gonna end up
with a quarter tonight.

382
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:49,504
Shit, you ain't paid me in two weeks.
What you bullshitting about a quarter?

383
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,433
Billie, Billie, go get it.
Get the money.

384
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,852
Go on. Get it.

385
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,864
Do you want my arm to fall off?

386
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:32,964
Take it. Take the money.
Take it, Billie.

387
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,608
<i>I fell in love with you
the first time I looked into</i>

388
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,443
<i>Them there eyes</i>

389
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,529
<i>'Cause you have a certain little
cute way of flirting</i>

390
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:59,866
<i>With them there eyes</i>

391
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:04,704
<i>They make me feel so happy
They make me feel so blue</i>

392
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:05,914
Take it.

393
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,667
<i>I'm falling, no stalling</i>

394
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:10,752
- Here's some money.
- Work it out, baby.

395
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,673
<i>My heart is jumping
You've started something</i>

396
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:17,676
<i>With them there eyes</i>

397
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:23,348
<i>You'd better look out
little brown eyes if you're wise</i>

398
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,392
Sing like a lady. Come on, lady.

399
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:26,726
<i>They bubble</i>

400
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:29,771
<i>Gonna get you
in a whole lot of trouble</i>

401
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,816
<i>Ooh, baby</i>

402
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:38,822
<i>Them there eyes</i>

403
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,950
<i>Them there eyes</i>

404
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:48,915
Here's your cut, Billie. I like you.
I think you're gonna make it.

405
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:51,126
Thanks, Jerry. I like you, too.

406
00:36:53,837 --> 00:36:55,588
Say, baby, that's beautiful.

407
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:56,965
Here, take some.

408
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,134
Get out.
Come on, you were beautiful tonight.

409
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,094
I just wanna tell you thank you.

410
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,221
I love you.
You were beautiful. Just pretty.

411
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,473
Thank you. I really was scared,
I'll tell you that.

412
00:37:05,557 --> 00:37:07,851
You should have been scared.
Them niggers is dangerous.

413
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,936
- Billie.
- What you doing?

414
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:12,105
- Billie.
- Yeah? Yeah, Jerry.

415
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,314
These are for you.

416
00:37:13,398 --> 00:37:15,650
There's a car
waiting for you upstairs.

417
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,944
- Thanks, Jerry.
- Here's your money, Yvonne.

418
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:19,863
A car waiting for me upstairs.

419
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,702
Don't flash them moon eyes at me.
I didn't send you nothing.

420
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,328
There was never a doubt in my mind.

421
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:29,748
Besides, there's a card,
and you probably can't even write.

422
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,207
Don't have to know how to read,
neither,

423
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,001
to know what that card's saying.

424
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,503
If he spent as much time
running his numbers

425
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38,882
as he does them damn gardenias,
he could have one hell of a business.

426
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,970
Think you're pretty smart, don't you?
Well, what do you know?

427
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,764
You got a great thing going in here.

428
00:37:45,847 --> 00:37:48,933
Leave that nigger alone.
He is dangerous. You understand?

429
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:52,270
He pulls that bit on everybody,
got a room full of girls at home.

430
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,772
You just gonna be another one.
You wanna be that?

431
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,356
Billie, you got too much going.

432
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,818
This is one face
that won't get that hungry.

433
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,987
I don't stand in no line for nobody.

434
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,238
All right.

435
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:05,074
Not even Mr. Louis McKay.

436
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,162
Jerry?

437
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:14,000
- Tell him the answer is no.
- No?

438
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,210
No.

439
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:23,301
That'll show him, 'cause he usually
gets everyone he wants.

440
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:27,055
He can get this one, too,
but not on the first night.

441
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,559
Good night, lady.

442
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,103
- Good night, Billie.
- Good night, Jerry.

443
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:39,275
What's the matter?
You don't like gardenias?

444
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,403
They're okay.

445
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:45,156
So?

446
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,743
So you don't put them on
just to go to someone's apartment

447
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:51,287
for a late-night supper.

448
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:56,626
- So that's how it is?
- That's how it is.

449
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,379
Pardon me, lady, I must have
got you mixed up with someone

450
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,967
who used to reside at Missus...
What's her name?

451
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,345
If that's what you thought, nigger,
why'd you give me them damn flowers?

452
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,347
Why didn't you
just give me some money?

453
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:15,854
I did.

454
00:39:21,234 --> 00:39:25,113
Hey, Billie.
Listen, listen, all right?

455
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,156
You don't mind
if I call you Billie, do you?

456
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,075
- Don't call me nothing.
- No, listen.

457
00:39:29,158 --> 00:39:31,578
Listen, I know a place downtown.
It's open all night.

458
00:39:31,661 --> 00:39:35,039
A fantastic place. You can eat.
You can have food. You can dance.

459
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,666
You can do anything you want.
Now, come on.

460
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,209
Just like the late-night-supper stuff?

461
00:39:38,293 --> 00:39:41,170
No, no, this is for real, baby.
Listen, there's my car right there.

462
00:39:41,254 --> 00:39:43,172
We can go on
right down there right now.

463
00:39:43,256 --> 00:39:44,799
Listen, I like you.

464
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,426
I wouldn't do anything to harm you.

465
00:39:46,509 --> 00:39:49,012
- I'm so thrilled.
- Really, seriously.

466
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,058
Please, Billie.

467
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:58,187
- Please? Pretty please?
- Pretty please.

468
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,315
All right?

469
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:04,402
Come on. You look so pretty.

470
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:14,579
What's been going on?

471
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,540
Good evening.

472
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:21,169
- Mr. McKay, nice to see you again.
- Paul, <i>come stai?</i>

473
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,463
<i>- Bene. Bene.</i> How are you?
- Good.

474
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,882
Gosh, you stayed away a long time.

475
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,024
<i>I might have done a lot of things</i>

476
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,234
<i>Been smiled upon by kings and queens</i>

477
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:46,986
<i>Had you been around</i>

478
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,573
<i>Perhaps had you been by my side</i>

479
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,659
<i>My dreams might not have been denied</i>

480
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,494
<i>Had you been around</i>

481
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:59,958
<i>I've wasted many years
tasted many tears</i>

482
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,543
<i>And I want to know</i>

483
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:10,259
<i>Lost on my own before I knew of you</i>

484
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,762
<i>I might have heard a sigh</i>

485
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,806
<i>Of someone passing by</i>

486
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,975
<i>Had you been around</i>

487
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,520
<i>And though it seems absurd</i>

488
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:21,813
<i>I really never heard</i>

489
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:25,566
<i>A sound</i>

490
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,612
<i>Until that day you came my way</i>

491
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:33,408
<i>With pleasure I never found</i>

492
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,159
<i>It all might have been</i>

493
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:40,415
<i>Had you been around</i>

494
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,379
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

495
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:49,215
Fantastic. Fantastic.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

496
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,717
Thank you, Janie.

497
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,386
She gets better-looking every day,
doesn't she, guys?

498
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,972
Well, how do you like this place?
Isn't this something?

499
00:41:56,055 --> 00:42:00,018
I wanted to bring you here because
I thought you'd really enjoy yourself.

500
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,102
It ain't so hot.

501
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,438
I been to a whole lot of places
like this before.

502
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,611
Is that so? Right. Well, where?

503
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,122
- Where?
- Where what?

504
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,834
You said you've been
to a lot of places like this before.

505
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,129
- Where?
- Did I say that?

506
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,882
I heard you say that.
Maybe I misunderstood what you said.

507
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:33,593
What do you think you said?

508
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,055
I said, you ain't so hot.

509
00:42:39,015 --> 00:42:40,016
Well...

510
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,270
I...

511
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:46,981
I just love the way you talk,
you know what I mean?

512
00:42:47,065 --> 00:42:48,483
Well, you make me...

513
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:52,361
You know... I've never met
nobody like you before, you know?

514
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,530
- You kind of make me speechless.
- Do I really?

515
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:56,324
- I mean, really?
- I mean, yeah.

516
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,409
Right. I don't know
what to do with myself, you see.

517
00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:01,537
I don't even know what to do with
my hands and everything, you know?

518
00:43:02,205 --> 00:43:04,957
You sure have pretty teeth
when you smile.

519
00:43:06,626 --> 00:43:08,002
Okay.

520
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:11,506
And that, you know...

521
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:16,844
That dress.
I want to tell you about that dress.

522
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:21,349
That dress brings out
the best tones in your skin.

523
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,814
Do you feel like dancing?

524
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:32,902
I don't know.

525
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,113
Well, I feel like dancing.

526
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,658
Go on and dance, then.
Ain't nobody stopping you.

527
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,245
You mean,
you want me to dance by myself?

528
00:43:44,831 --> 00:43:46,457
Okay.

529
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:49,418
Thank you. I really appreciate that.

530
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:53,172
Yeah, you really a nice lady,
you know? Come on, now.

531
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,561
Mr. McKay,

532
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:09,689
I have a confession to make.

533
00:44:10,523 --> 00:44:11,941
What's that?

534
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,360
This place is fantastic,

535
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,946
and so are you.

536
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,906
Yeah.

537
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,252
<i>- What are you doing?
- Nothing.</i>

538
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,504
<i>Can't you do it sleeping?</i>

539
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:38,551
I really can't believe
I'm here with you, you know that?

540
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,595
If you don't go to sleep,
you won't be.

541
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,141
That's what I get
for breaking a house rule.

542
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:49,061
I like to have breakfast alone,
you know what I mean?

543
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:13,211
What are you doing, woman?

544
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,176
You want me to leave, don't you?

545
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,182
Look, when I want you to leave,
I'll let you know, okay?

546
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:27,558
Okay.

547
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,143
Okay.

548
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,862
Just so you don't get any big idea,
you understand?

549
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:45,952
- We'll take this a day at a time.
- Okay.

550
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,828
All right.

551
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:49,580
Anything you say.

552
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,295
Louis?

553
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,550
Now what?

554
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,848
How do you like your eggs?

555
00:46:47,722 --> 00:46:50,308
<i>I want a pig foot</i>

556
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:54,979
<i>And a bottle of beer</i>

557
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,703
Is she great? Is she beautiful?

558
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:13,956
Okay. Okay, folks,
we got a little celebration.

559
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:15,499
Our lady

560
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:18,878
herself, Miss Billie,

561
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:21,672
appearing in this nightclub
for one year.

562
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,343
And in honor...

563
00:47:25,426 --> 00:47:28,929
In honor of the occasion...
Bring that in, and be careful with it.

564
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,973
Everybody gets a piece.

565
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,850
I mean a hunk. A hunk of the cake.

566
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,853
Courtesy of the house. Yeah.

567
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:40,107
And everybody's gonna get
a glass of champagne

568
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:43,277
courtesy of Mr. McKay over there.

569
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,241
Okay. Hey, Mr. Piano Man.

570
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:51,535
Come here. Come here.
You're the guy who discovered her.

571
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,245
How about you propose the toast?

572
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,247
I'm for that. Hey, Billie.

573
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:58,376
We got old cheapie
to spring for something.

574
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:01,170
You're beautiful, Jer. Damn, Jer!

575
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:04,173
Damn, but everything's beautiful.

576
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:06,092
He even paid the band, Billie,
since you been here.

577
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:09,637
Beautiful year. And everybody...
Girls. Look at the uniforms!

578
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,181
All right.
Look, even the hoes is making money.

579
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,143
That's only because
you're our biggest trick.

580
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,275
Anyway, Billie, we love you sincerely,
very much, in our hearts.

581
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,360
We sure do.

582
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:29,698
- You gonna play, Piano Man?
- Yeah.

583
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:31,575
Key a bar. Okay.

584
00:48:31,784 --> 00:48:32,785
Break it.

585
00:48:32,868 --> 00:48:34,829
<i>For she's a jolly good lady</i>

586
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,456
<i>For she's a jolly good lady</i>

587
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,335
<i>For she's a jolly good lady</i>

588
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:44,964
<i>Which nobody can deny</i>

589
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,180
Hey, Billie, I want you to meet
two friends of mine.

590
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,182
- This is Harry and Reg. Come on in.
- Yeah.

591
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,309
Come on in. There she is.

592
00:48:58,519 --> 00:48:59,728
-Hi, Harry
- Hi.

593
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:01,522
- Hi, Reg. How are you?
- Really nice to meet you.

594
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,815
I hate to interrupt you.

595
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,775
I know you're all celebrating
and everything,

596
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:08,821
but I just
sure appreciate meeting you.

597
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,033
My name is Harry Bradford.
That is, if you didn't get it.

598
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:15,536
- Over there, this is Reg Hanley.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

599
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,163
- Louis McKay.
- We...

600
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,875
We're just fans of yours.

601
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,376
And I need all the fans I can get.

602
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,086
Pull up a couple of chairs, fellows,
and join us.

603
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:25,463
Thank you.

604
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:30,551
Where do you fellows play?

605
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:33,512
Well, actually,
we're playing no place right now.

606
00:49:33,596 --> 00:49:37,057
Fact is, we're trying to form a band
to take a tour around the country,

607
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:39,727
and we wanted to talk to you
about joining us.

608
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,188
- Joining you? You serious?
- Very.

609
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,401
A colored singer with a white band?

610
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,653
Yeah. Yeah.

611
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,363
Yeah?

612
00:49:53,491 --> 00:49:55,159
You must want to
keep playing no place.

613
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,119
Well, you see,
that's exactly the point.

614
00:49:57,203 --> 00:50:00,581
We wouldn't be just another band
with you singing.

615
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,918
We'd be something special
because, well, you're special, Billie.

616
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,169
Here.

617
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,713
There you go.

618
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:10,466
Thank you.

619
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,259
We'd go straight to the top.
I know it.

620
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,053
I don't know about
no straight to the top.

621
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,222
I'm just trying
to get to a club downtown.

622
00:50:16,305 --> 00:50:17,515
We all are.

623
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:19,683
Of course, you don't understand,
see, the way you get downtown is...

624
00:50:19,767 --> 00:50:23,395
I mean, you know, the way you do that
is that you go out on the road,

625
00:50:23,479 --> 00:50:25,940
and you build up your name
in the sticks, and then, blam!

626
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,651
You get snapped up by network radio,
who're always looking

627
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:34,365
for someone big with the hicks
to sell them soap or something.

628
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,658
Yeah, then you come back to New York,

629
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,952
and besides radio,
there's records, club dates downtown,

630
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:41,163
- you name it, Billie.
- Just like that, huh?

631
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:43,666
Well, it works that way sometimes.

632
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,167
You mean to tell me
that I have to travel

633
00:50:45,251 --> 00:50:47,253
all the way to East Jesus and back,

634
00:50:47,336 --> 00:50:50,631
before I can get in some club downtown
less than five minutes away from here?

635
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,259
- Well...
- They full of shit, ain't they?

636
00:50:57,846 --> 00:51:02,810
I just think it'd be fantastic
if you just came with us.

637
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,854
- How about that?
- I'm sorry, fellows.

638
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,649
I think your band
is gonna have to start without me.

639
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,902
<i>I'll tell you what.
Piano Man's got my telephone number.</i>

640
00:51:12,027 --> 00:51:14,780
<i>If you give it some second thoughts,
give us a call.</i>

641
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,411
How you like my timestep, Reg?

642
00:51:20,536 --> 00:51:22,246
I think we might have
a part for you, Miss Holiday,

643
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,622
but we'll have to see your legs.

644
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,339
You know, the last time
I saw fields and farm animals,

645
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,301
I was hitching up north from Baltimore
to see my mama.

646
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:39,305
Leader, I am trying to follow a rule
called "food three times a day,"

647
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:40,848
but I sense we are dangerously behind.

648
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,099
Let me explain to you.

649
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,643
This is only Tuesday,
and I only feed on Friday.

650
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,688
Stop complaining, Oklahoma.

651
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,064
That's a horrible-looking thing.

652
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:52,610
You mean we have all this fun,
and we still get paid?

653
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:55,571
Well, about $12 a week
to do with what you will.

654
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:58,073
$14? Would you take $8?

655
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,575
Fantastic.
I'll take whatever you give me.

656
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,327
I get the chance to travel.
I get a chance to do everything.

657
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:02,453
I sense we're in for
a lot of candy stores

658
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,746
and a lot of jelly beans.

659
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,915
Can you imagine
someone liking to tour?

660
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,917
Yes, some fun, Billie.

661
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,170
Miss Holiday.

662
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,047
You're in the South now.

663
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:19,053
Jesus, look at this.

664
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:22,306
You got a half an hour, that's all.
Billie, let me help you out of there.

665
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:24,016
- A whole half-hour?
- Let me help you out.

666
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,517
Half an hour's all we got.

667
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,229
- Put your shoes on, man.
- Get on out here.

668
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,857
Billie, what'll it be?
What do you want?

669
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,778
What do I want? What do I really want?

670
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,364
- What do you really want?
- Well, I'll tell you.

671
00:52:38,697 --> 00:52:40,574
- What?
- I really want

672
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,744
a steak smothered in onions.

673
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:48,123
And I really want
a big pot of collard greens.

674
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,208
Right.

675
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:51,168
- And I want some yams.
- Right.

676
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:53,170
- I want some black-eyed peas and rice.
- Right.

677
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,797
And I want...

678
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,801
And I want... I want... I want...
I want a potato pie.

679
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,511
One hot dog, coming up.

680
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,222
- Mustard?
- Oh, crap.

681
00:53:06,058 --> 00:53:08,852
- Hey, Reg...
- Hello, I'm from the Board of Health.

682
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,317
Billie, you ain't missing a thing.

683
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:27,037
<i>I cried for you</i>

684
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:33,085
<i>What a fool I used to be</i>

685
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:37,089
<i>Now I found two eyes</i>

686
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:40,259
<i>Just a little bit bluer</i>

687
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:42,886
<i>I found a heart</i>

688
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,181
<i>Just a little bit truer</i>

689
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:50,769
<i>And I cried for you</i>

690
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:57,985
<i>Now it's your turn to cry over me</i>

691
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:04,867
Still think it's fun, Billie?

692
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:09,413
Watch it, will you?

693
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,457
<i>Sorry to say it's that time again.</i>

694
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:15,419
<i>This has been the</i> Oasis Cosmetics Hour
<i>from New York, New York,</i>

695
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:17,045
<i>featuring the new mellow sounds</i>

696
00:54:17,129 --> 00:54:20,007
<i>of our Sweet Sam
and His Society Swingers.</i>

697
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,258
<i>So until tomorrow night...</i>

698
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,342
Man, did you hear that?

699
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:23,802
- Here we go again.
- Did you hear that?

700
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:26,764
- Yeah.
- Sweet Sam and His Society Sissies.

701
00:54:26,847 --> 00:54:29,057
That's supposed to be us, man.
That should be our gig.

702
00:54:29,141 --> 00:54:30,350
Do you want to be a sissy?

703
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:34,188
Man, here we are, riding our asses off
all over this cotton-picking country,

704
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:37,357
trying to win these hicks over,
and what do we got to show for it?

705
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,068
Zero. Nothing, man. Bullshit.

706
00:54:40,152 --> 00:54:43,906
Where is that big radio cat
that's supposed to discover us, Reg?

707
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,616
Where is that son of a bitch, anyway?

708
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,076
Watch your mouth.
Can't you see there's a lady present?

709
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,537
That's right.
Show some respect, you motherfucker.

710
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:52,831
Billie.

711
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,253
Who is it?

712
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:00,923
It's Harry.

713
00:55:01,882 --> 00:55:03,801
- What do you want?
- Can I come in?

714
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:05,677
Come on.

715
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:11,975
Gonna be a rehearsal downstairs
in 10 minutes.

716
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:13,811
Oh, boy.

717
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:18,857
We got a full day off next week.

718
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,321
I'll be dead by next week.

719
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,788
I'm taking the night off.

720
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:37,626
You take tonight off,

721
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:43,298
and, sure as hell,
that'll be the night

722
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:46,552
that Mr. Network Radio Scout

723
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:50,347
is sitting out front
and all the things.

724
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,725
I mean, everything that we've been
doing goes right down the drain

725
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:59,273
because, let's face it, Billie,
you are the cream in our coffee.

726
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,400
You got that the wrong way around,
don't you?

727
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:04,653
We are just another band without you.

728
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,197
Okay.

729
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:11,243
Give me a shot of that bourbon
in my bag, will you?

730
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,957
Well, how about a real...

731
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:21,378
A real what?

732
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:26,842
One shot and you'll be flying.

733
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,762
Look, Harry,
like I've been telling you,

734
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:33,807
what you do is your business.

735
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,934
I may be tired, but I ain't dumb.

736
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:38,103
You're walking across a street.
A truck hits you.

737
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,187
You're laying in the street.

738
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:41,565
They take you to the nearest hospital.
What's the first thing they do?

739
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:45,819
They give you a shot of morphine.
Now, morphine ain't an aspirin.

740
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:49,114
It's dope.

741
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:52,576
Do you think that makes you an addict?

742
00:56:54,286 --> 00:56:57,456
One goddamn little shot ain't gonna

743
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:02,002
make you a junkie,
but, you know, it keeps you flying.

744
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,963
Okay, Harry. If I get hit by a truck,
I'll call you, okay?

745
00:57:05,881 --> 00:57:07,132
Now get out of here.

746
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:25,108
Reg, how much longer
before we get to the next town,

747
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,861
- or a gas station or something?
- Well, from the looks of things,

748
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,863
it's gonna be back roads
and cow pastures

749
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:31,406
for quite a while yet.

750
00:57:31,490 --> 00:57:33,617
Pull over to a clump of bushes
or something then?

751
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,035
- No.
- A hedge?

752
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,495
- Come on, please.
- All right.

753
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,706
You have but to ask, madam,
this vehicle is at your disposal.

754
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,000
- How about the lake?
- Come on.

755
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,377
All right.

756
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,049
You should take a look at it out here.

757
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:53,136
It's beautiful. Look at those trees.

758
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:03,605
Hey, Billie. Where you going?
You forgot the sheet music.

759
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,941
Just turn your head.

760
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:07,693
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

761
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:02,164
Come on, Billie.

762
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,629
Let's go. All aboard.

763
00:59:48,752 --> 00:59:54,132
<i>Southern trees</i>

764
00:59:54,925 --> 01:00:01,681
<i>Bear a strange fruit</i>

765
01:00:03,058 --> 01:00:09,064
<i>Blood on the leaves</i>

766
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:15,779
<i>And blood at the root</i>

767
01:00:16,822 --> 01:00:22,035
<i>Here is a fruit</i>

768
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:28,416
<i>For the crows to pluck</i>

769
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:34,381
<i>For the rain to gather</i>

770
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:42,389
<i>For the wind to suck</i>

771
01:00:46,351 --> 01:00:53,024
<i>For the sun to rot</i>

772
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:58,029
<i>For the tree</i>

773
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:04,786
<i>To drop</i>

774
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:12,752
<i>Here is a strange</i>

775
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:18,425
<i>And bitter</i>

776
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:26,183
<i>Crop</i>

777
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:38,612
<i>Now we're proud to present our
feature vocalist, Miss Billie Holiday.</i>

778
01:01:43,992 --> 01:01:46,494
<i>You're mean to me</i>

779
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:49,456
<i>Why must you be mean to me?</i>

780
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:52,459
<i>Gee, honey, it seems to me</i>

781
01:01:52,542 --> 01:01:55,212
<i>You love to see me crying</i>

782
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,214
<i>I don't know why</i>

783
01:01:57,297 --> 01:02:00,508
<i>I stay home each night when you</i>

784
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:07,515
<i>Left all alone
Singing the blues and crying</i>

785
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:13,271
<i>You treat me coldly
each day in the year</i>

786
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:17,359
<i>You always scold me</i>

787
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:22,989
<i>Whenever you're mean to me...</i>

788
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,004
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

789
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,799
<i>Miss Holiday has been
experiencing some dizzy spells.</i>

790
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,468
<i>I'm sure she'll be back with us
in just a little while.</i>

791
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,971
<i>We will continue
with an instrumental right now,</i>

792
01:02:46,054 --> 01:02:48,598
<i>and I'm sure she'll be all right.
Thank you very much.</i>

793
01:02:48,682 --> 01:02:49,933
<i>Thank you.</i>

794
01:02:52,978 --> 01:02:56,398
<i>But if you treat me right, Daddy</i>

795
01:02:57,565 --> 01:03:01,695
<i>I'll stay home every day</i>

796
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:08,159
<i>If you treat me right, Daddy</i>

797
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:13,373
<i>I'll stay home every day</i>

798
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:19,087
<i>But you're so mean to me, baby</i>

799
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:24,426
<i>I know you're gonna drive me away</i>

800
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:29,889
<i>Love is just like a faucet</i>

801
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,853
<i>It turns off and on</i>

802
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:41,234
<i>Love is just like a faucet</i>

803
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:46,156
<i>It turns off and on</i>

804
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:51,161
<i>Sometimes when you think it's on, baby</i>

805
01:03:51,745 --> 01:03:58,418
<i>It has turned off and gone</i>

806
01:03:59,586 --> 01:04:02,005
How about singing
that <i>Old Black Joe</i> there, Billie.

807
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,132
Come on, now. Don't go.

808
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:05,884
Sing <i>Old Black Joe.</i>

809
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:09,012
Come on. Don't stop, Billie.
Keep going now.

810
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:11,139
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

811
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,265
<i>Thank you.</i>

812
01:04:12,432 --> 01:04:15,268
You know that ditty <i>Old Black Joe,</i>
don't you, honey, baby?

813
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:19,439
<i>Now, I'd love to do them all for you.
I'd love to do it for you,</i>

814
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:21,483
<i>but we got something planned here.</i>

815
01:04:21,566 --> 01:04:25,320
<i>A little number called</i>
What a Little Moonlight Can Do.

816
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:43,963
<i>What a little moonlight can do</i>

817
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:55,058
<i>What a little moonlight can do to you</i>

818
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,772
<i>You're in love</i>

819
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,985
<i>Your heart's fluttering all day long</i>

820
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:10,865
<i>You only shudder
'cause your poor tongue</i>

821
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:15,161
<i>Just won't utter the words</i>

822
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:19,332
<i>I love you</i>

823
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:23,962
Miss Billie Holiday.
Let's give her another hand.

824
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,551
Hey, baby.

825
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,638
Baby, what you doing here?

826
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,976
Here, I've been trying
to get you on the phone. Oh, baby.

827
01:05:39,102 --> 01:05:40,687
I missed you so much.

828
01:05:41,813 --> 01:05:44,482
You look so good, baby.

829
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,235
How'd you get here?

830
01:05:47,569 --> 01:05:48,862
Get your clothes off.

831
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,700
I like your style,
but I can't say much for your timing.

832
01:05:54,701 --> 01:05:57,328
Why don't we wait till we get home,
get a nice hot bath?

833
01:05:57,412 --> 01:05:58,413
No.

834
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:04,919
Whatever you say.
My, my, the man is ready.

835
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:06,546
Well, so am I.

836
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:14,679
We've been having a rough tour.

837
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,016
Baby, I'm so happy you're here.

838
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,437
Now, this is all I'm gonna do.

839
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,982
And I want you to do the rest...

840
01:06:27,609 --> 01:06:29,068
You're hurting me.

841
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:30,945
Jesus.

842
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:35,241
All right, that's it.
Come on, let's go.

843
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,701
- I know what you're thinking.
- This tour's over.

844
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,912
I'm the one who sent you here,
and I'm taking you back home.

845
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,163
So get your things, let's go.

846
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,539
Wait a minute.
I know what you're thinking, baby.

847
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,999
I don't wanna hear about it.
Just come home.

848
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:44,584
I'm not hooked.

849
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,383
No, I ain't going.

850
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:55,470
I ain't going, Louis.

851
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:02,310
Billie, listen to me.

852
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:06,940
All right.

853
01:07:12,028 --> 01:07:13,321
Billie, it...

854
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:19,118
Believe me when I tell you
that this is for your own good.

855
01:07:19,202 --> 01:07:20,787
Don't preach to me, Louis.

856
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:23,289
All that I plan for you
is done with you in mind.

857
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,960
You affect my whole life, baby.
I love you.

858
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:30,171
If you go down, baby. I go down, too.

859
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,257
I'm not going down.

860
01:07:32,549 --> 01:07:35,134
Because there ain't no place
down there I wanna be.

861
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,680
Be going up, baby.

862
01:07:39,681 --> 01:07:41,015
It'll just take a little time.

863
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:44,519
I love you, too. I love you.

864
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:49,274
Sure, I've taken a few shots,
but only when I needed it,

865
01:07:49,357 --> 01:07:51,484
and I'm not hooked, Louis. Wait, baby.

866
01:07:51,609 --> 01:07:55,572
Only when you needed it.
What do you think hooked is?

867
01:07:57,365 --> 01:07:59,367
All I had to do is listen
to your voice on the telephone,

868
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:00,618
and I knew.

869
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,412
Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

870
01:08:02,537 --> 01:08:04,581
One of those old fake cats
you be running around with?

871
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:06,833
I've been on those streets
all of my life.

872
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,668
I know what that shit is.

873
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,173
It's good, ain't it?

874
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,677
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

875
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,638
We're going home, now.

876
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,976
Wait, baby, wait.

877
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,020
See? You don't understand.

878
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,189
Now, you don't know how it is

879
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:34,068
when people are looking down at you,
and laughing at you,

880
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:36,654
and think that I'm a loser.

881
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:39,490
And if I go home now,
I'll think that I'm one, too.

882
01:08:39,574 --> 01:08:42,118
I gotta prove it to them,
I gotta prove it to myself.

883
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:43,661
What are you proving with that needle?

884
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,540
That you're not woman enough
to make it without a crutch,

885
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:51,127
a magic way out, when the going
gets a little too rough?

886
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:56,424
I want you to make it, too, baby,
but not this way. Not this way.

887
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:57,842
Okay.

888
01:08:57,925 --> 01:09:00,053
Okay, I promise you
I won't take any more stuff.

889
01:09:01,179 --> 01:09:05,224
I promise you. I gotta stay out here.
You're gonna let me stay?

890
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,602
- No.
- Louis, please.

891
01:09:07,727 --> 01:09:09,312
I get it. I'll be big,

892
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:11,314
and then I can work at a good club,
and we'll be together.

893
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,067
I promise you, I won't take
any more stuff. Come on, Louis.

894
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:16,653
Come on, Louis,
won't you take your clothes off?

895
01:09:16,986 --> 01:09:21,866
Come on. Come on, Louis, please.
I can't go now.

896
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,660
I gotta take you home, baby,
because I know...

897
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,078
I ain't going.

898
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:28,831
Hey, Crazy Maurice and Weird Lucille
want us to go out there with them.

899
01:09:28,915 --> 01:09:32,460
Lady, what do you have this door
locked for? You cool?

900
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,295
I'm fine, Harry.

901
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,007
Come on in.

902
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,804
Well, there he is.

903
01:09:43,971 --> 01:09:45,390
How the hell are you?

904
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:47,100
He's fine.

905
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:55,066
I just dropped by
to see if you needed anything.

906
01:09:55,817 --> 01:10:00,446
Like a trip back to the hotel
or something,

907
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,782
but I guess you got it covered.

908
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,576
- So I'll catch you later, okay?
- See you at the hotel.

909
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,955
Bye. See you at the hotel.

910
01:10:15,670 --> 01:10:17,046
Harry's a good friend.

911
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:25,263
That's what every little girl needs,
a good friend like Harry.

912
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:30,727
Okay.

913
01:10:32,186 --> 01:10:35,773
I'm gonna get some gas for the car,
and I'll take you back to the hotel.

914
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:39,861
Louis...

915
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:44,490
I love you.

916
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:50,872
I promise you. No more stuff, okay?

917
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,166
I promise you.

918
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,640
Nine.

919
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:11,225
- Come on, Billie.
- Five.

920
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:12,894
- Eight.
- Seven.

921
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,103
Here we go, babe.

922
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,605
$2 she hits them.

923
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:26,574
- Jesus Christ!
- What?

924
01:11:26,741 --> 01:11:27,825
Billie, get out of sight.

925
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,786
- Billie, come on.
- No, God damn.

926
01:11:29,869 --> 01:11:31,078
Billie, get out of sight.

927
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:49,722
- God damn!
- How are you? Hi, motherfucker.

928
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:54,811
- Motherfucker! Fuck you! Shit!
- Billie. Billie.

929
01:11:54,894 --> 01:11:57,355
- Hey, you nigger! What you doing?
- Go!

930
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,942
- You son of a bitch! Fuck you!
- They'll kill you, honey.

931
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:02,360
They'll kill you.

932
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,612
You motherfuckers get a good look!

933
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:06,531
- I ain't finished!
- Get down there!

934
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:09,158
- No! Kiss my ass, you motherfuckers!
- Get this bus going, you asshole!

935
01:12:09,242 --> 01:12:11,828
Kiss my ass, you white-ass fascists!

936
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:32,265
Billie, you all right?

937
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:33,933
Relax, honey.

938
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,810
Fuck you, motherfuckers!

939
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,354
Billie. Billie, don't, honey.

940
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:42,400
Don't. Relax, relax.
Relax, it's okay. It's okay, Billie.

941
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:49,740
Guess who's out there?

942
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:53,035
Mr. Network Radio Scout himself
sitting out there as big as life.

943
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:54,328
Oh, no.

944
01:12:54,412 --> 01:12:55,955
- He's right.
- That's right. Yeah.

945
01:12:58,916 --> 01:12:59,959
Can you make it, Billie?

946
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,213
Sure, I can make it.

947
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,799
That's what we came out here for,
isn't it?

948
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,509
- Isn't she great?
- I'll help you.

949
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:10,845
No, that's fine.
I'll take care of myself.

950
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,263
Okay.

951
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:17,810
Y'all get on out of here
so I can get dressed and get ready.

952
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:20,271
- You know, I think I love you.
- Come on, now. Let's go.

953
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,231
Give me my tie.

954
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:44,689
<i>Give me</i>

955
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,860
I can't.

956
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,437
What the hell are you looking at?

957
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:41,746
<i>Ding dong ain't it swell</i>

958
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:43,914
<i>They just delivered the liberty bell</i>

959
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:48,419
<i>How sad
all those Philadelphians will be</i>

960
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:54,133
<i>He keeps making fancy passes at me</i>

961
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,768
And now, a word from our sponsor,
Sunray Soap.

962
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:07,354
Mommy? Mommy, what am I gonna do?

963
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,732
What's the matter, Shirley?

964
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,318
Why are there tears
running down your cheeks?

965
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:13,444
Good luck.

966
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:16,072
'Cause none of the kids
will play with me.

967
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,991
Let me look at you. My, my.

968
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:23,329
I see. Your complexion
is so dull and listless.

969
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:26,749
I think this is a job for Sunray Soap.

970
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,959
And later, that same day...

971
01:16:29,043 --> 01:16:32,171
Mommy? Mommy, what am I gonna do?

972
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:36,050
I have so many friends
I don't know who to play with first.

973
01:16:36,175 --> 01:16:37,676
Play with yourself.

974
01:16:38,636 --> 01:16:40,513
And now, we continue with our show,

975
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:43,224
by introducing you
to still another new vocalist.

976
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:46,685
Sunray Soap brings you
the lovely and talented

977
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:50,523
Miss Angela DeMarco.

978
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,072
I'm next.

979
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:02,493
<i>Hello, Broadway, how do you do?</i>

980
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,913
<i>I've waited a lifetime
to say hi to you</i>

981
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:11,544
<i>Hello, Broadway, here comes me</i>

982
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,215
<i>And those who fought me
will say they taught me</i>

983
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:19,093
<i>Everything I know</i>

984
01:17:19,468 --> 01:17:23,097
<i>They used to fool me
Now they say they knew me</i>

985
01:17:23,180 --> 01:17:26,308
<i>Hello, Broadway's opening night</i>

986
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,061
<i>Thank you for my name in lights</i>

987
01:17:29,145 --> 01:17:32,690
<i>Hello, Broadway, I like your style</i>

988
01:17:32,773 --> 01:17:36,068
<i>Now that I'm here
I'll wait for a while</i>

989
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:42,324
<i>Hello, Broadway, here comes me</i>

990
01:17:45,703 --> 01:17:48,914
<i>And that, ladies and gentlemen
of the listening and dancing audience,</i>

991
01:17:48,998 --> 01:17:49,999
<i>is our show.</i>

992
01:17:50,374 --> 01:17:52,418
<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
we're off the air.</i>

993
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,173
<i>You heard the Reg Hanley Band
with our featured vocalists,</i>

994
01:17:57,256 --> 01:18:00,009
<i>Angela DeMarco and Debbie McGee.</i>

995
01:18:36,921 --> 01:18:38,214
We tried, Billie.

996
01:18:39,298 --> 01:18:41,592
Those Sunray people,
they wouldn't go for it.

997
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,219
They just wouldn't buy it.

998
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,432
I suppose we could've
told you upfront,

999
01:18:48,515 --> 01:18:51,727
but we were just hoping
they'd get some sense in their heads

1000
01:18:51,810 --> 01:18:52,811
and change their...

1001
01:18:52,895 --> 01:18:54,271
Mr. Marshall, the network scout,

1002
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,106
he was on the phone
all during the show

1003
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:57,608
arguing with them, Billie.

1004
01:18:57,691 --> 01:19:01,195
Look, you fellows don't have to
explain nothing. I understand.

1005
01:19:02,613 --> 01:19:06,784
They're trying to sell soap, right?
Everybody knows we don't use it.

1006
01:19:09,453 --> 01:19:11,038
Get a bright complexion.

1007
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:14,458
Pretty white hands.

1008
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:20,130
We got a party to go to, don't we?

1009
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:22,967
We still got a table
at Cafe Manhattan.

1010
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,719
Cafe Manhattan?

1011
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,431
You told me if I went on tour,
I'd get downtown.

1012
01:19:29,515 --> 01:19:31,141
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1013
01:19:31,225 --> 01:19:32,309
Yeah.

1014
01:19:32,393 --> 01:19:34,186
What you all just sitting there for?

1015
01:19:35,271 --> 01:19:36,438
Come on, gang.

1016
01:19:37,147 --> 01:19:39,900
We gonna get some of them
lily-white hands, ain't we?

1017
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:41,902
That's right. We got a party to go to.

1018
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:44,405
- Come on, Mama.
- Come on, baby.

1019
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:56,458
That piano man's killing me
with them bad notes.

1020
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:57,626
I know.

1021
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,257
- Billie, I say you're the greatest.
- I think you're the greatest, too.

1022
01:20:06,552 --> 01:20:07,636
What you...

1023
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,473
Oh, man, Vic, you can't be ordering
no beer in a club like this, man.

1024
01:20:11,557 --> 01:20:14,435
You order beer, and they think
you want to wash your hair.

1025
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,854
Beer's what the sidemen get.

1026
01:20:17,563 --> 01:20:20,024
You gotta get something flashier.
You hit the big time, now.

1027
01:20:20,107 --> 01:20:21,275
His hair needs it.

1028
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:27,489
Reg, Reg, Reg, my man.
You're my main man, you know that?

1029
01:20:27,573 --> 01:20:28,991
You all right in my book.

1030
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,119
Come on, Harry.

1031
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,457
There you go.

1032
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:40,210
And one for Mama. Little Mama.

1033
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:46,967
- All right, we're gonna have a toast.
- All right.

1034
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:48,344
- Everybody.
- Here we go.

1035
01:20:48,427 --> 01:20:50,471
- To Reg.
- Well.

1036
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:56,352
Who got us home, no more to roam,
and drink this goddamn foam.

1037
01:20:57,936 --> 01:20:58,937
Drink up.

1038
01:21:01,482 --> 01:21:02,691
All right.

1039
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:14,119
- Harry, can you meet me outside?
- No.

1040
01:21:14,870 --> 01:21:17,247
What you mean, Har, "no"? Come on.

1041
01:21:18,665 --> 01:21:21,126
You ain't gonna get anything from me,
I mean, not right under his nose.

1042
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,130
- I want to keep mine in one piece.
- I know you...

1043
01:21:26,548 --> 01:21:29,009
I know you ain't scared of Louis, now.
Come on.

1044
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:32,513
Billie, go home. Go home.

1045
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:39,978
I can't let them know
them goddamn soap bastards got to me.

1046
01:21:40,854 --> 01:21:42,189
Don't do that to me, buddy.

1047
01:21:44,525 --> 01:21:46,735
You think I'm crazy enough
to carry in the city?

1048
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,612
Come on, pal.

1049
01:21:50,489 --> 01:21:51,740
Billie, go home.

1050
01:21:52,950 --> 01:21:54,451
You know you can't fight it
when you're hooked,

1051
01:21:54,535 --> 01:21:55,536
and you are hooked.

1052
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,579
You're an A number-one mainliner.

1053
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:02,000
You think so, huh?

1054
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:05,921
Okay, pally.

1055
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,133
Motherfucker.

1056
01:22:11,677 --> 01:22:12,761
I'm sorry.

1057
01:22:13,762 --> 01:22:14,930
My glass slipped.

1058
01:22:18,142 --> 01:22:20,727
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm going home, Mama.

1059
01:22:22,062 --> 01:22:24,314
I don't feel so good. I'm just tired.

1060
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:27,526
Hey, look, let's go.
This party's too tight-ass for me.

1061
01:22:28,193 --> 01:22:30,195
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1062
01:22:30,654 --> 01:22:31,989
No, no, no, wait a minute, now.

1063
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:35,033
Listen, I got some business
to take care of and...

1064
01:22:35,659 --> 01:22:37,744
Just hang on for a few minutes.
Everything will be smooth

1065
01:22:37,828 --> 01:22:39,246
and I'll take you right on home, okay?

1066
01:22:39,329 --> 01:22:40,664
A very talented young lady
is here tonight.

1067
01:22:40,747 --> 01:22:41,915
No, it's not okay.

1068
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:44,710
If you don't get a cab,
I'll get my own self a cab, okay?

1069
01:22:44,793 --> 01:22:46,170
Billie, take it easy, baby.

1070
01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:48,464
With a little coaxing,
maybe we can get her up here to sing.

1071
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,799
Wait one minute. One minute. Okay?

1072
01:22:50,883 --> 01:22:54,178
Ladies and gentlemen,
Cafe Manhattan proudly presents

1073
01:22:54,261 --> 01:22:55,721
Miss Billie Holiday.

1074
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,563
Come on, Billie.

1075
01:23:06,356 --> 01:23:07,566
Hey, Billie.

1076
01:23:08,358 --> 01:23:09,943
They're all cheering for you.

1077
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:34,968
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1078
01:23:35,969 --> 01:23:38,722
<i>You old gloomy sight</i>

1079
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:42,434
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1080
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:46,688
<i>Thought we said goodbye last night</i>

1081
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:53,529
<i>I tossed and turned
until it seemed you had gone</i>

1082
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:59,284
<i>But here you are with the dawn</i>

1083
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,957
<i>Wish I'd forget you</i>

1084
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:09,461
<i>But you're here to stay</i>

1085
01:24:10,546 --> 01:24:12,881
<i>It seems I met you</i>

1086
01:24:13,507 --> 01:24:17,135
<i>When my love went away</i>

1087
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:23,934
<i>Now everyday I start by saying to you</i>

1088
01:24:26,270 --> 01:24:30,607
<i>Good morning, heartache, what's new?</i>

1089
01:24:33,944 --> 01:24:38,115
<i>Stop haunting me now</i>

1090
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:45,914
<i>Can't shake you no how</i>

1091
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:53,797
<i>Just leave me alone</i>

1092
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:59,011
<i>I've got those Monday blues</i>

1093
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:02,723
<i>Straight through Sunday blues</i>

1094
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,310
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1095
01:25:07,519 --> 01:25:10,522
<i>Here we go again</i>

1096
01:25:12,232 --> 01:25:14,401
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1097
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:18,530
<i>You're the one who knew me when</i>

1098
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:22,784
<i>Might as well get used to you</i>

1099
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:26,872
<i>Hanging around</i>

1100
01:25:28,040 --> 01:25:32,461
<i>Good morning, heartache</i>

1101
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:37,382
<i>Sit down</i>

1102
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,564
Let's hear it for her, folks.

1103
01:25:52,648 --> 01:25:54,733
- Billie Holiday.
- One more. One more.

1104
01:25:55,901 --> 01:25:59,863
Come on. Let's bring her back, folks.
Bring her back. Billie Holiday.

1105
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,796
Come on, baby, I gotta pee.

1106
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:19,758
So that's why you ran out
of the club so fast, huh?

1107
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:20,884
Yeah.

1108
01:26:21,551 --> 01:26:23,345
Ain't that something? Well...

1109
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,681
Come on, baby, let me in.

1110
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,225
Wait a minute. Now, wait, wait, wait.

1111
01:26:29,142 --> 01:26:31,269
They don't have no woman's john
at the club?

1112
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:33,730
You know they got a woman's john
at the club.

1113
01:26:33,814 --> 01:26:36,108
- Come on.
- Come on what?

1114
01:26:36,233 --> 01:26:37,776
- It was dirty.
- What's dirty?

1115
01:26:37,901 --> 01:26:40,028
What are you talking about?
Wait a minute.

1116
01:26:40,112 --> 01:26:43,198
- The toilet at the club. Come on.
- What's wrong?

1117
01:26:43,323 --> 01:26:44,825
What's wrong?

1118
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:46,618
Come on, I gotta go.

1119
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,996
I gotta... Come on, let me in.

1120
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,999
You know what they say, you gotta go,
you gotta go. Here you go.

1121
01:26:54,459 --> 01:26:56,378
Yeah, I know you don't want me...

1122
01:26:57,504 --> 01:26:58,505
Come on.

1123
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,716
You're always hogging up the bathroom.

1124
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,260
You never give me a chance
to get in the bathroom.

1125
01:27:03,343 --> 01:27:06,388
- I'm getting so sick.
- You better use this.

1126
01:27:06,471 --> 01:27:09,141
'Cause if you gotta go,
you better use this right now. Go on.

1127
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:12,102
'Cause I can't let you
in the bathroom.

1128
01:27:12,185 --> 01:27:13,270
You want me to do it right here?

1129
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:16,106
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1130
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:20,193
What's the problem? Why are you sick?

1131
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:25,115
I am not gonna let you
go in that bathroom, not right now.

1132
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,033
Not right now.

1133
01:27:37,294 --> 01:27:38,295
Billie!

1134
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:40,338
God damn it!

1135
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:48,764
It's mine.

1136
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:52,642
Look, honey. I'll hold on
to that stuff. Wait, you're all...

1137
01:27:59,900 --> 01:28:01,234
Billie.

1138
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,740
No, this is my...

1139
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,367
You're taking...

1140
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:10,994
Give it to me!

1141
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:12,829
Give it.

1142
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,503
Give it to me.

1143
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:21,755
You'd kill me for it, wouldn't you?

1144
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:51,613
Going out for a walk.

1145
01:30:56,284 --> 01:30:57,702
When I come back,

1146
01:31:01,539 --> 01:31:03,541
I don't want to find you here.

1147
01:31:28,358 --> 01:31:31,861
<i>If I should take a notion</i>

1148
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:35,031
<i>To jump into the ocean</i>

1149
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,369
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1150
01:31:41,079 --> 01:31:44,791
<i>If I go to church on Sunday</i>

1151
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,919
<i>Then cabaret all day Monday</i>

1152
01:31:48,086 --> 01:31:51,631
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1153
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:57,220
<i>If my man ain't got no money</i>

1154
01:31:57,429 --> 01:32:00,181
<i>And I say take all mine, honey</i>

1155
01:32:00,432 --> 01:32:04,352
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1156
01:32:06,104 --> 01:32:09,232
<i>I swear I won't call no copper</i>

1157
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:12,527
<i>If I'm beat up by my papa</i>

1158
01:32:12,736 --> 01:32:16,823
<i>Ain't nobody's business if I do</i>

1159
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:21,411
<i>Nobody's business</i>

1160
01:32:21,661 --> 01:32:24,539
<i>Ain't nobody's business</i>

1161
01:32:24,831 --> 01:32:30,253
<i>Nobody's business if I do</i>

1162
01:32:34,716 --> 01:32:36,134
<i>Thank you.</i>

1163
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,387
<i>Thank you, you're sweet.</i>

1164
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:45,101
<i>You're so sweet sometimes.
Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

1165
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,562
<i>We gonna take
a short intermission right here,</i>

1166
01:32:47,687 --> 01:32:49,898
<i>'cause the band's gotta pee.</i>

1167
01:32:50,774 --> 01:32:52,525
<i>We gonna be right back.</i>

1168
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:55,820
<i>Bring up your girl, Yvonne,
to do a little dance for you.</i>

1169
01:32:56,112 --> 01:32:58,073
<i>I thank you for your money
and your time.</i>

1170
01:32:58,156 --> 01:32:59,365
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

1171
01:32:59,783 --> 01:33:03,536
- I'm your fan, sugar.
<i>- You handsome devil, you.</i>

1172
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,831
<i>I'll be right back. Right back.</i>

1173
01:33:18,259 --> 01:33:20,637
Billie, Billie, it's all yours.

1174
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:22,806
-Hi, Reg
- Hi.

1175
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:25,100
Thank you, Jerry.

1176
01:33:25,475 --> 01:33:27,310
Hey, Reg, what you doing here?

1177
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,605
- I just went to see your mother.
- Oh, yeah?

1178
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,066
She wanted to know if you were
coming by the hospital tonight.

1179
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:36,486
Of course, I'm coming by.
You know I'm coming by.

1180
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,613
You take care of your mama,
I take care of mine.

1181
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:40,949
Yeah, she just wanted to know,
that's all, Billie.

1182
01:33:41,074 --> 01:33:42,492
Listen, I can wait around
and take you over there?

1183
01:33:42,659 --> 01:33:44,285
- Jerry...
- What time is it?

1184
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:49,916
9:18. Jerry said
he'd let you off early. I asked him.

1185
01:33:51,876 --> 01:33:54,254
You know, that song
you just got through singing,

1186
01:33:54,379 --> 01:33:55,839
<i>It 'Ain't Nobody's Business?</i>

1187
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,093
Well, that's not true.

1188
01:34:00,927 --> 01:34:02,595
Many people around
who love you, Billie.

1189
01:34:04,764 --> 01:34:06,641
- Yeah, okay.
- Billie?

1190
01:34:06,850 --> 01:34:08,393
- Yeah?
- Sing pretty.

1191
01:34:20,196 --> 01:34:23,032
Come on back. We're waiting.
Let's get down with it.

1192
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,876
<i>I don't know why</i>

1193
01:34:32,959 --> 01:34:36,921
<i>But I'm feeling so sad</i>

1194
01:34:37,589 --> 01:34:40,383
<i>I long to try</i>

1195
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:43,887
<i>Something I never had</i>

1196
01:34:44,470 --> 01:34:47,348
<i>Never had no kissing</i>

1197
01:34:48,141 --> 01:34:51,144
<i>Oh, what I've been missing</i>

1198
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:56,858
<i>Lover man, oh, where can you be?</i>

1199
01:34:58,401 --> 01:35:01,196
<i>The night is cold</i>

1200
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:05,158
<i>And I'm so all alone</i>

1201
01:35:06,075 --> 01:35:08,870
<i>I'd give my soul</i>

1202
01:35:08,953 --> 01:35:12,457
<i>Just to call you my own</i>

1203
01:35:13,291 --> 01:35:16,461
<i>Got the moon above me</i>

1204
01:35:17,086 --> 01:35:20,131
<i>But no one to love me</i>

1205
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:26,054
<i>Lover man, oh, where can you be?</i>

1206
01:35:28,848 --> 01:35:32,727
Don't go, Billie. Come on, back, baby,
and sing <i>The Man I Love.</i>

1207
01:35:32,852 --> 01:35:35,063
Take care of business.
Hurry back, Billie.

1208
01:35:35,188 --> 01:35:37,774
Yeah, be cool, baby.
Don't overdo it now.

1209
01:35:47,033 --> 01:35:48,868
Baby, you wanna stick it in my eye?

1210
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:55,041
- Come on. Put it right up in there.
- Yeah, yeah.

1211
01:35:56,292 --> 01:35:57,502
Come on, sweetheart.

1212
01:35:57,585 --> 01:35:59,754
Yeah, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

1213
01:36:05,176 --> 01:36:07,845
- Hey, man, don't come in my room.
- Billie, what's wrong? Billie.

1214
01:36:07,929 --> 01:36:09,806
- Don't come in my room.
- Come on, Billie. Come on.

1215
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:12,225
Girl, come on, you don't need
this gutter-pusher's shit.

1216
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:14,477
- I'm telling you.
- Look, I don't wanna talk to you.

1217
01:36:14,560 --> 01:36:17,021
He cuts his shit.
You don't know what he cuts it with.

1218
01:36:17,105 --> 01:36:18,606
He don't care what he cuts it with.

1219
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:19,774
God damn, you gonna take a chance

1220
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,693
on a hotshot
on this nigger's reference?

1221
01:36:21,776 --> 01:36:22,944
"Hotshot"?

1222
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:25,113
What you mean, "hotshot"?

1223
01:36:25,196 --> 01:36:27,323
- Don't you never say that again.
- I'm sorry.

1224
01:36:27,907 --> 01:36:29,993
I didn't mean nothing by it, Hawk.

1225
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,911
- Give me that shit.
- I'm sorry.

1226
01:36:31,995 --> 01:36:34,038
- Come on, just... Just...
- Billie.

1227
01:36:34,122 --> 01:36:36,708
- Telephone.
- I appreciate you saying this.

1228
01:36:36,791 --> 01:36:38,293
I can get some shit for us.

1229
01:36:38,376 --> 01:36:39,419
- Now, listen.
- Bullshit.

1230
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:40,795
I ain't going to no goddamn phone.

1231
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,797
- Wait a minute, man.
- Tell them to hold it, shit.

1232
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:44,382
Listen to me,
you're going to the phone now.

1233
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,801
- I ain't going out.
- Billie, it's the hospital.

1234
01:36:46,884 --> 01:36:48,803
- There's a phone call.
- I ain't going to no...

1235
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:51,681
- I don't care if it's the hospital.
- Do you want it, baby?

1236
01:36:51,764 --> 01:36:55,268
- Do you want it, baby?
- No, she don't want no shit now, man.

1237
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:56,853
- Hawk.
- You want it, baby?

1238
01:36:56,936 --> 01:36:58,313
Don't do that to me.

1239
01:36:59,188 --> 01:37:01,024
Billie, it's a phone call.

1240
01:37:01,649 --> 01:37:03,693
- Come on, baby.
- Come on man, come on.

1241
01:37:03,776 --> 01:37:05,695
Billie, I can get some shit,
good shit.

1242
01:37:05,778 --> 01:37:07,739
You understand?
I don't get high on beer, baby.

1243
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:09,615
You don't need this shit.

1244
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:14,746
Hello.

1245
01:37:15,288 --> 01:37:18,082
Yeah. Yeah, this is Billie Holiday.
Who is this?

1246
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21,502
Yeah. Yeah, I get it.

1247
01:37:41,314 --> 01:37:42,815
Get on out of here.
Take care of your business.

1248
01:37:42,899 --> 01:37:44,734
Now, wait a minute, Hawk.
Hawk, now, wait.

1249
01:37:44,817 --> 01:37:47,070
- I love Billie.
- Go on, man, get out of here.

1250
01:37:47,403 --> 01:37:50,365
You done hit me, man.
I'll get you, nigger.

1251
01:37:50,448 --> 01:37:53,618
Man, I'm sorry. I fucked up, didn't I?

1252
01:37:55,536 --> 01:37:57,205
You know me, though, man.
We used to get...

1253
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:58,414
- You know that.
- Yeah.

1254
01:37:58,498 --> 01:38:01,042
I used to steal shit
and sell it to you for stuff.

1255
01:38:04,712 --> 01:38:05,755
Get out.

1256
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:09,467
- Billie, don't...
- Get out.

1257
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:12,512
- You heard what the lady said.
- I'm talking to you, Hawk.

1258
01:38:13,388 --> 01:38:14,597
Get out.

1259
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,349
Get out of here.

1260
01:38:16,432 --> 01:38:18,893
Okay, I'm just gonna
take this for my...

1261
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,104
- Billie, wait.
- Watch your mouth.

1262
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:22,313
I'm getting out!

1263
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:24,941
Wait, now, Billie.

1264
01:38:25,024 --> 01:38:28,361
- You dumb, girl. She's being dumb.
- Get out of here.

1265
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:32,073
- Hawk. Hawk.
- I'm getting paid, though.

1266
01:38:33,241 --> 01:38:37,036
We'll be out later. Yeah.
Did you see Jerry's face?

1267
01:38:42,333 --> 01:38:45,920
Who gives a... Come on, Billie.
You handled that nigger.

1268
01:38:47,922 --> 01:38:49,632
Yeah, I know how you feel.
You gonna kick it.

1269
01:38:49,715 --> 01:38:52,760
I know you. You come to, you see?
You know, what I mean?

1270
01:38:52,844 --> 01:38:55,388
I need... You know. I don't need much.

1271
01:38:56,097 --> 01:38:57,932
You know, look at that. Nothing.

1272
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,143
Dookie. That's right.

1273
01:39:02,145 --> 01:39:03,563
We go see Mama.

1274
01:39:04,188 --> 01:39:06,482
The Duchess, laying up there,
been waiting for you.

1275
01:39:06,566 --> 01:39:09,735
She loves you. She love me, too.
She says she gonna cook for me.

1276
01:39:10,403 --> 01:39:12,905
- Piano Man.
- What? What, baby?

1277
01:39:13,698 --> 01:39:16,325
- Come on. You went through a lot.
- Mama...

1278
01:39:17,452 --> 01:39:18,870
Yes, Mama.

1279
01:39:21,664 --> 01:39:24,625
- That nigger scared me.
- My mama didn't make it.

1280
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:28,254
"Mama didn't make it."
Mama didn't make what?

1281
01:39:28,337 --> 01:39:30,173
What you talking about,
"Mama didn't make it"?

1282
01:39:30,256 --> 01:39:31,716
Stop that now.

1283
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:33,551
The Duchess is gone.

1284
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:39,432
Billie, Billie.

1285
01:39:42,393 --> 01:39:43,644
Billie.

1286
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:48,941
Billie.

1287
01:39:50,443 --> 01:39:54,655
Billie, your mama.
Your mama's gone, Billie.

1288
01:40:05,917 --> 01:40:07,126
Piano Man.

1289
01:40:08,044 --> 01:40:09,253
Piano Man.

1290
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:22,683
Mama.

1291
01:40:26,979 --> 01:40:29,106
Everything's going wrong.

1292
01:41:16,862 --> 01:41:18,322
Mr. McKay?

1293
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:21,826
- Dr. Grossman?
- Yes, how are you?

1294
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:25,454
It's good to see you.
You're on time, too.

1295
01:41:26,163 --> 01:41:27,290
It's good to see you.

1296
01:41:27,582 --> 01:41:29,458
I'm very happy you called me.

1297
01:41:29,709 --> 01:41:31,961
Well, to tell you the truth,

1298
01:41:32,878 --> 01:41:34,463
I had no choice.

1299
01:41:35,047 --> 01:41:38,175
You see, it's a question of the bill.

1300
01:41:38,259 --> 01:41:41,345
She seems to be under the impression
that we could make some arrangements.

1301
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,639
- Where is she?
- Why, she's right there, by the tree.

1302
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:47,810
Listen, will you do me a little favor?
Don't tell her I'm taking care of it.

1303
01:41:48,269 --> 01:41:50,938
Okay. Now, you do me a favor.

1304
01:41:51,063 --> 01:41:53,899
Don't you tell her I contacted you.

1305
01:41:53,983 --> 01:41:56,694
You know, it's a matter of ethics,
you know?

1306
01:41:56,777 --> 01:42:01,240
And I need her full confidence.
You understand?

1307
01:42:01,574 --> 01:42:04,869
But the fact that she came here alone
speaks a lot for her.

1308
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:09,540
Doctor, do you mind if I have
one of your nurses give her this?

1309
01:42:09,624 --> 01:42:11,709
No, not at all. Nurse.

1310
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,881
Would you give this box
to Miss Holiday?

1311
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:18,633
She's over there under the tree.

1312
01:42:19,759 --> 01:42:21,969
I appreciate this, Doctor.

1313
01:42:22,345 --> 01:42:25,097
- Thank you so much.
- Don't mention it. Don't mention it.

1314
01:42:25,681 --> 01:42:28,893
- Well, I hope you have a good visit.
- Yeah, thank you.

1315
01:42:58,839 --> 01:43:00,007
Boo.

1316
01:43:02,259 --> 01:43:03,761
Louis.

1317
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:06,681
How'd you find me?

1318
01:43:08,057 --> 01:43:10,393
I didn't tell anybody
where I was gonna be.

1319
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:15,981
Listen, I heard about your mom.
I'm sorry, baby.

1320
01:43:17,358 --> 01:43:19,694
I wish there was something
I could've done.

1321
01:43:19,777 --> 01:43:20,861
No.

1322
01:43:22,071 --> 01:43:24,448
I have to start doing things
for myself.

1323
01:43:24,532 --> 01:43:25,658
Louis...

1324
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:29,203
I made up my mind. No more singing.

1325
01:43:29,620 --> 01:43:33,416
It only seems to get me into trouble,
you know?

1326
01:43:33,499 --> 01:43:36,669
Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
Let me see your eyes, okay?

1327
01:43:36,752 --> 01:43:40,548
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Let me see. Let me see.

1328
01:43:45,553 --> 01:43:47,346
Don't look so hot.

1329
01:43:50,182 --> 01:43:51,892
You're beautiful.

1330
01:43:52,476 --> 01:43:53,686
No.

1331
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:58,899
Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna make a deal with you.

1332
01:44:00,359 --> 01:44:03,279
If you promise to be Mrs. Louis McKay,

1333
01:44:03,362 --> 01:44:06,991
I promise
I'll never leave you alone again.

1334
01:44:15,666 --> 01:44:17,042
You're kidding, aren't you?

1335
01:44:17,126 --> 01:44:20,171
No, I'm not kidding, baby.
I'm not kidding.

1336
01:44:21,130 --> 01:44:24,842
Okay, it's a deal. It's a deal.
It's a deal.

1337
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:27,136
Fantastic.

1338
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:29,930
Now how about signing, sealing
and delivering the goods

1339
01:44:30,014 --> 01:44:32,516
right on that little finger
right there?

1340
01:44:32,725 --> 01:44:35,436
Okay, I better get to town
before the stores close.

1341
01:44:36,353 --> 01:44:37,688
I'll be back tomorrow.

1342
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:39,315
- Bright and early.
- Okay.

1343
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:42,777
- You take care of yourself, okay?
- Okay.

1344
01:44:46,697 --> 01:44:50,242
I love you, you know that?
I'll always love you.

1345
01:45:06,842 --> 01:45:09,220
Doctor. Doctor.

1346
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:15,684
Billie Holiday?

1347
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,523
- Billie Holiday?
- Yes. Yes, that's me.

1348
01:45:20,606 --> 01:45:23,400
I'm Detective Hennen, New York City
Police Department, Narcotics Division.

1349
01:45:23,484 --> 01:45:25,653
- We got a warrant for your arrest.
- What's going on?

1350
01:45:25,736 --> 01:45:27,446
- We gotta take you in.
- What the hell's going on?

1351
01:45:27,530 --> 01:45:29,031
We're taking her in
for illegal use of...

1352
01:45:29,114 --> 01:45:31,200
She's under my medical care.
This is a private hospital.

1353
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:33,619
Look, Doc, it's still illegal,
and you know it.

1354
01:45:33,702 --> 01:45:34,870
Now, don't give us any trouble.

1355
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,747
Get dressed, miss,
or we'll have to take you in...

1356
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:39,291
But you don't understand.
She's on gradual withdrawal.

1357
01:45:39,375 --> 01:45:42,628
<i>If she stops cold, the shock
to her system could kill her.</i>

1358
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:44,713
<i>Don't you understand?
It could kill her.</i>

1359
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:12,616
- How is she, Doc?
- We'll find out soon enough.

1360
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:15,077
- Come on, get her up here.
- Hey, baby.

1361
01:46:15,160 --> 01:46:16,495
Let me see.

1362
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:21,292
All right.
Now, Louis, help me get this off.

1363
01:46:21,709 --> 01:46:22,793
You take this arm.

1364
01:46:22,877 --> 01:46:24,295
I'm trying to get her
out of this place.

1365
01:46:24,378 --> 01:46:27,673
I'm sorry, they told me to get you
in and out of here in five minutes.

1366
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:31,051
The right arm. Lift the sleeve.

1367
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:34,346
Here. Yeah, that's it.
Now, you hold her still now.

1368
01:46:35,347 --> 01:46:36,849
There we are.

1369
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:42,313
Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy. Easy.

1370
01:46:42,396 --> 01:46:43,731
Okay.

1371
01:46:45,900 --> 01:46:48,485
Hold her still now. That's it. Now.

1372
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,535
There we are.

1373
01:47:00,039 --> 01:47:01,457
This could be worse.

1374
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:05,628
But when she was at my place,

1375
01:47:05,711 --> 01:47:09,298
- we gave her less, less and less.
- I gotta get her out of this place.

1376
01:47:09,381 --> 01:47:11,967
And that helped her fight this off.
Her heart's very strong.

1377
01:47:12,051 --> 01:47:14,720
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
I will have to ask you to hurry.

1378
01:47:17,681 --> 01:47:18,891
I'm coming.

1379
01:47:19,433 --> 01:47:21,393
- Okay, let's take look.
- All right, now listen.

1380
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:23,103
Good.

1381
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:25,898
- Now you get this thing on again.
- I'll take care of that.

1382
01:47:25,981 --> 01:47:27,983
- There we go.
- You go ahead, now.

1383
01:47:28,067 --> 01:47:29,193
Don't worry, Louis.

1384
01:47:29,276 --> 01:47:32,237
All right, I'll catch up.
I'll catch you when you get outside.

1385
01:47:37,284 --> 01:47:40,871
Baby. Baby.

1386
01:47:49,797 --> 01:47:51,840
You must feel like the alonest

1387
01:47:53,384 --> 01:47:55,219
girl in this whole life right now.

1388
01:47:57,846 --> 01:47:59,765
- Mama.
- Billie.

1389
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:03,394
Listen. Listen, baby. Listen.

1390
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:04,853
Look.

1391
01:48:07,523 --> 01:48:10,609
You see that? You see?

1392
01:48:10,693 --> 01:48:12,361
You see that?

1393
01:48:14,363 --> 01:48:16,949
- If you hear me...
- Louis.

1394
01:48:17,866 --> 01:48:19,535
This is gonna be yours.

1395
01:48:20,869 --> 01:48:23,664
Please take me home.

1396
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:28,335
I'm gonna give you this with love.

1397
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:32,172
With all...

1398
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:35,884
All of the love
I know and feel for you.

1399
01:48:41,181 --> 01:48:42,474
Billie.

1400
01:48:46,478 --> 01:48:48,564
I'm sorry. You're gonna have to go.

1401
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:51,066
I'm sorry.

1402
01:48:51,150 --> 01:48:52,276
Billie.

1403
01:48:54,069 --> 01:48:55,612
I'm with you, baby.

1404
01:48:58,866 --> 01:48:59,950
I'm with you.

1405
01:49:01,243 --> 01:49:02,953
I'll always be with you.

1406
01:49:09,877 --> 01:49:16,800
<i>Lady sings the blues</i>

1407
01:49:16,884 --> 01:49:21,847
<i>She's got 'em bad</i>

1408
01:49:21,930 --> 01:49:27,311
<i>She feels so sad</i>

1409
01:49:28,562 --> 01:49:34,818
<i>Wants the world to know</i>

1410
01:49:36,070 --> 01:49:42,409
<i>Just what her blues is all about</i>

1411
01:49:43,702 --> 01:49:46,997
<i>The blues ain't nothing</i>

1412
01:49:47,081 --> 01:49:51,418
<i>But a pain in your heart</i>

1413
01:49:52,169 --> 01:49:56,465
<i>When you got a bad start</i>

1414
01:49:56,799 --> 01:50:02,096
<i>You and your man have to part</i>

1415
01:50:02,179 --> 01:50:03,555
- She'll be here any minute now.
- Be quiet.

1416
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:06,141
Hold it. Hold it. Everybody, hold it.
Now, wait a minute.

1417
01:50:06,225 --> 01:50:08,102
This is a welcome-home party
for Billie, yeah?

1418
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:10,354
I tell you what,
let's all be nice and jolly.

1419
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:14,817
And you, not one word about jail
or bars or serving time or...

1420
01:50:14,900 --> 01:50:16,401
- Or nervousness.
- Or nervousness.

1421
01:50:16,485 --> 01:50:17,903
Would you move out the way?

1422
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:19,321
She's here. She's here. She's here.

1423
01:50:19,404 --> 01:50:20,948
One minute.
One minute, I tell you what.

1424
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:22,950
Everybody get in place
and turn out the lights.

1425
01:50:23,033 --> 01:50:24,868
- But I didn't get the sign up.
- Turn out the lights.

1426
01:50:24,952 --> 01:50:26,745
- Get it up.
- Turn off the lights.

1427
01:50:26,829 --> 01:50:28,163
Please.

1428
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:31,834
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- The lights.

1429
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:37,714
Nice and quiet.

1430
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:41,343
What do you mean?
She stepped on my foot.

1431
01:50:42,302 --> 01:50:43,512
Quiet.

1432
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,728
- Surprise!
- Surprise, Billie.

1433
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:53,313
Billie, you look beautiful.

1434
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:55,649
- You look great, Billie.
- Welcome home, Billie.

1435
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:59,111
Nice to see you, Billie.
I hope we're not intruding.

1436
01:51:01,405 --> 01:51:05,075
The funny thing about being away,
you forget what everybody look like.

1437
01:51:05,534 --> 01:51:07,244
- I tried to...
- He's still homely.

1438
01:51:09,371 --> 01:51:13,125
I tried to picture your faces
so many times, but...

1439
01:51:15,169 --> 01:51:16,587
I got a little...

1440
01:51:17,296 --> 01:51:19,923
I got a little blurry.
I couldn't figure what you look like.

1441
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:22,384
Do a party. Give me a kiss.

1442
01:51:24,803 --> 01:51:27,723
Bring her in. Let's show her
what we got for her. Get up.

1443
01:51:27,806 --> 01:51:30,100
- Thank you.
- How about one for your first boss?

1444
01:51:35,439 --> 01:51:37,566
- And me.
- Leave her alone.

1445
01:51:37,649 --> 01:51:39,401
Why don't you shut up?

1446
01:51:39,484 --> 01:51:42,279
You didn't let none of them
dikey broads get to you, did you?

1447
01:51:42,362 --> 01:51:44,114
- Come on. Come on.
- Big dinner.

1448
01:51:44,198 --> 01:51:45,699
Fried chicken?

1449
01:51:48,869 --> 01:51:51,663
<i>Dance right out of my shoes</i>

1450
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:53,749
<i>Never see you
with your clothes on, dear</i>

1451
01:51:53,832 --> 01:51:59,880
<i>Band starts playing
the lowdown shuffle blues</i>

1452
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:01,798
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1453
01:52:01,882 --> 01:52:03,300
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1454
01:52:03,508 --> 01:52:04,843
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1455
01:52:09,264 --> 01:52:12,768
- You never get that note.
- No, but you might yourself.

1456
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:16,313
You better come back 'cause
Jerry ain't made enough money yet.

1457
01:52:16,396 --> 01:52:19,524
We just as poor we can be,
ain't we, Mr. Jerry?

1458
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,903
When are you coming back?
'Cause we miss you, honest to God.

1459
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,780
I don't care, rich or poor,
we miss you.

1460
01:52:24,863 --> 01:52:26,031
But we're poor, we need you.

1461
01:52:26,114 --> 01:52:29,743
- Yeah, right.
- Well, I ain't gonna be coming back.

1462
01:52:30,911 --> 01:52:34,289
Unless you can get this piano
and the club into my kitchen

1463
01:52:34,373 --> 01:52:38,085
because I'm gonna be cooking
for that pretty nigger over there,

1464
01:52:39,253 --> 01:52:43,465
so I can get fat,
and we might have some babies.

1465
01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:48,971
- Billie, I got something for you.
- Piano Man, a little <i>arpege.</i>

1466
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:50,597
We got something ourselves, over here.

1467
01:52:50,681 --> 01:52:51,890
Yeah.

1468
01:52:52,349 --> 01:52:54,309
Speech. Speech. Give me a little...

1469
01:52:54,935 --> 01:52:55,978
White man talking.

1470
01:52:57,229 --> 01:52:58,272
What is that?

1471
01:52:58,355 --> 01:53:00,691
Well, me and the band,
we've been doing pretty good.

1472
01:53:00,774 --> 01:53:04,319
All because of a certain lady,
and we even got a record contract.

1473
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:06,363
Fantastic.

1474
01:53:06,446 --> 01:53:07,614
And we cut one song

1475
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:10,242
I think you might know
called <i>Don't Explain</i>,

1476
01:53:10,742 --> 01:53:14,496
and written by a little skinny lady,
and I put her name right on there.

1477
01:53:15,247 --> 01:53:17,541
"Written by Miss Billie Holiday."

1478
01:53:19,167 --> 01:53:20,294
Thank you.

1479
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:36,018
<i>You know that I love you</i>

1480
01:53:36,184 --> 01:53:39,688
<i>And what love endures</i>

1481
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:42,941
<i>All my thoughts are of you</i>

1482
01:53:43,358 --> 01:53:46,611
<i>For I'm so completely yours</i>

1483
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:49,823
<i>Cry to hear folks chatter</i>

1484
01:53:50,574 --> 01:53:53,869
<i>And I know you cheat</i>

1485
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:57,205
<i>Right or wrong don't matter</i>

1486
01:53:57,581 --> 01:54:00,208
<i>When you're with me, sweet</i>

1487
01:54:01,793 --> 01:54:03,420
<i>Hush now</i>

1488
01:54:05,297 --> 01:54:07,841
<i>Don't explain</i>

1489
01:54:09,593 --> 01:54:13,513
<i>What is there to gain?</i>

1490
01:54:15,098 --> 01:54:18,101
<i>I'm glad</i>

1491
01:54:18,352 --> 01:54:21,396
<i>You're back</i>

1492
01:54:22,981 --> 01:54:27,736
<i>Don't explain</i>

1493
01:54:46,546 --> 01:54:48,131
It's about the best I can do,

1494
01:54:49,424 --> 01:54:51,468
but it isn't enough, is it?

1495
01:54:52,344 --> 01:54:54,137
Come on, what are you talking about?

1496
01:55:00,602 --> 01:55:03,855
How long is it gonna be
before you get back to work?

1497
01:55:03,939 --> 01:55:05,774
A month? Two months?

1498
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:09,111
No.

1499
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:15,242
- No.
- Who are you kidding, Billie?

1500
01:55:21,706 --> 01:55:23,166
Me, I guess.

1501
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,589
- So, what happens now?
- What do you think happens, woman?

1502
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:38,849
You do it right this time.

1503
01:55:41,685 --> 01:55:43,270
Get yourself

1504
01:55:46,440 --> 01:55:49,609
an agent that'll take care
of your career

1505
01:55:52,404 --> 01:55:55,699
and a husband
that'll take care of you.

1506
01:55:56,491 --> 01:55:58,410
I love you.

1507
01:55:59,369 --> 01:56:00,537
I really do.

1508
01:56:04,916 --> 01:56:08,128
I meant what I said
about working in the kitchen.

1509
01:56:08,211 --> 01:56:10,297
Working in the kitchen?
What are you gonna do in there?

1510
01:56:10,380 --> 01:56:12,924
You still haven't learned
to boil an egg.

1511
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:26,646
You got a felony rap against you,
and that automatically revokes

1512
01:56:26,730 --> 01:56:28,940
your license in New York.
You know that.

1513
01:56:29,024 --> 01:56:30,358
No, I didn't know that.

1514
01:56:30,442 --> 01:56:33,778
And if you're not working in New York,
you're nothing.

1515
01:56:33,862 --> 01:56:38,783
Give me an idea. Give me a suggestion.
I'll work with you. I love your work.

1516
01:56:39,910 --> 01:56:42,913
- But what can I do?
- Let's kick it around.

1517
01:56:42,996 --> 01:56:44,998
All right. Think about it.

1518
01:56:45,499 --> 01:56:48,502
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1519
01:56:49,586 --> 01:56:51,296
Wait a minute.

1520
01:56:53,507 --> 01:56:56,176
You do something for me, Miss Holiday,

1521
01:56:56,968 --> 01:57:00,889
and I'll do something for you.
I'll get you back in New York.

1522
01:57:00,972 --> 01:57:04,643
You take a month,
no, two months on the road.

1523
01:57:04,726 --> 01:57:07,729
I'll book you into top spots.
Be sure of that.

1524
01:57:07,854 --> 01:57:11,191
You bring me back reviews
that are raves.

1525
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:13,026
And you'll kill them.
I know you'll kill them.

1526
01:57:13,109 --> 01:57:14,945
- I don't wanna work on any bus tours.
- No, wait a minute.

1527
01:57:15,028 --> 01:57:17,656
- Let him finish what he's saying...
- You knock them dead,

1528
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:23,161
you sing your heart out,
you bring me back that publicity.

1529
01:57:23,537 --> 01:57:26,748
And I'll make those
license commissioners take notice.

1530
01:57:26,831 --> 01:57:27,999
You know how?

1531
01:57:28,291 --> 01:57:30,335
I'll get you Carnegie Hall.

1532
01:57:33,046 --> 01:57:35,340
No, wait. Wait a minute.

1533
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:38,843
Now, wait, wait, wait.
I know you don't sing opera.

1534
01:57:38,927 --> 01:57:41,972
I know you don't sing
with the hands held over here.

1535
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:45,934
I know your style,
but that's the very point.

1536
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:50,272
- I am a jazz singer. And...
- Now you got it.

1537
01:57:50,814 --> 01:57:54,359
Did you ever hear
of any agent in the world

1538
01:57:54,442 --> 01:57:58,238
booking a jazz singer
into Carnegie Hall?

1539
01:57:58,321 --> 01:58:00,991
I'll have the newspaper guys,
the magazine fellows,

1540
01:58:01,074 --> 01:58:03,118
the radio, the newsreel.

1541
01:58:04,160 --> 01:58:05,370
And, Billie,

1542
01:58:06,371 --> 01:58:09,749
when that curtain goes down
on your opening night,

1543
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:14,796
you're gonna hear a noise
that'll shake that frigging place.

1544
01:58:14,879 --> 01:58:17,632
Then show me the license commissioner

1545
01:58:17,716 --> 01:58:21,469
with the courage who would dare
not to give you back your license.

1546
01:58:21,553 --> 01:58:24,264
That audience will tear him into bits.

1547
01:58:24,347 --> 01:58:27,225
- Billie, you're gonna do it?
- What do you think?

1548
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:29,811
You couldn't do that for me,
could you?

1549
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:32,772
- You've made a deal.
- I'd have to take my manager.

1550
01:58:32,856 --> 01:58:34,691
I just have two people
that I have to take.

1551
01:58:34,774 --> 01:58:37,235
I have to take my piano player, and...

1552
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:41,281
Louis, you will go with me, won't you?

1553
01:58:41,906 --> 01:58:43,199
Come on.

1554
01:58:45,076 --> 01:58:46,369
- Carnegie Hall?
- All right, when do we leave?

1555
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:49,998
All right, we get Carnegie Hall.
Yes, Carnegie Hall's a big deal.

1556
01:58:50,081 --> 01:58:51,499
It's a deal.

1557
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:53,543
<i>It's very clear</i>

1558
01:58:54,794 --> 01:58:58,131
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1559
01:58:58,548 --> 01:59:00,800
<i>Not for a year</i>

1560
01:59:01,259 --> 01:59:04,012
<i>But ever and a day</i>

1561
01:59:05,013 --> 01:59:07,182
<i>The radio</i>

1562
01:59:07,265 --> 01:59:09,142
<i>And the telephone</i>

1563
01:59:09,225 --> 01:59:11,728
<i>And the movies that we know</i>

1564
01:59:11,811 --> 01:59:14,606
<i>May just be passing fancies</i>

1565
01:59:14,689 --> 01:59:18,234
<i>And, in time, may go</i>

1566
01:59:18,318 --> 01:59:20,195
<i>But, oh, my dear</i>

1567
01:59:21,112 --> 01:59:24,074
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1568
01:59:24,824 --> 01:59:26,826
<i>Together we're</i>

1569
01:59:27,535 --> 01:59:30,622
<i>Going a long, long way</i>

1570
01:59:31,414 --> 01:59:33,875
<i>In time, the Rockies may crumble</i>

1571
01:59:33,958 --> 01:59:35,794
<i>Gibraltar may tumble</i>

1572
01:59:35,919 --> 01:59:38,963
<i>They're only made of clay</i>

1573
01:59:39,089 --> 01:59:42,884
<i>But our love is here to stay</i>

1574
01:59:56,690 --> 02:00:00,318
<i>The radio and the telephone</i>

1575
02:00:00,402 --> 02:00:03,530
<i>And the movies that we know</i>

1576
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:06,658
<i>May just be passing fancies</i>

1577
02:00:06,741 --> 02:00:09,202
<i>And in time may go</i>

1578
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:12,330
<i>But, oh, my dear</i>

1579
02:00:12,414 --> 02:00:15,542
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1580
02:00:16,626 --> 02:00:21,798
<i>Together we're going a long, long way</i>

1581
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:25,802
<i>In time, the Rockies may crumble</i>

1582
02:00:25,885 --> 02:00:27,512
<i>Gibraltar may tumble</i>

1583
02:00:27,595 --> 02:00:29,848
<i>They're only made of clay</i>

1584
02:00:29,931 --> 02:00:34,102
<i>But our love is here to</i>

1585
02:00:34,185 --> 02:00:37,230
<i>Our love is here to</i>

1586
02:00:37,313 --> 02:00:42,277
<i>Our love is here to stay</i>

1587
02:00:45,071 --> 02:00:47,115
My business is falling apart
without me.

1588
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:48,908
I've been out here
three months already.

1589
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,412
What did Bernie say on the phone
two hours ago?

1590
02:00:52,495 --> 02:00:54,831
Another one or two weeks
ought to do it.

1591
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:56,207
That's Bernie's new slogan.

1592
02:00:56,291 --> 02:00:58,668
I've never heard it before
except 1,000 times.

1593
02:00:58,752 --> 02:01:01,004
Pretty soon it's not gonna matter
one way or the other.

1594
02:01:01,087 --> 02:01:03,423
It matters. That we know. All right?

1595
02:01:03,548 --> 02:01:07,218
Louis, Louis, wait just a minute.
Look, I'm sick and tired

1596
02:01:07,302 --> 02:01:09,554
of all these train stations
and strange hotels.

1597
02:01:09,637 --> 02:01:11,723
I wanna be at home,
and, with you leaving now,

1598
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:14,184
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
you know?

1599
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:17,479
Well, at least with me in
New York City, I can pressure Bernie.

1600
02:01:17,562 --> 02:01:19,564
- You know, I can keep an eye on him.
- To hell with Bernie.

1601
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:20,690
I'm not thinking about Bernie.

1602
02:01:20,774 --> 02:01:22,984
I'm thinking about you and me.
You know I need you.

1603
02:01:23,067 --> 02:01:24,569
You told me
you were never gonna leave me.

1604
02:01:24,652 --> 02:01:25,695
I know, baby, listen...

1605
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:26,905
You told me
you would never leave me alone.

1606
02:01:26,988 --> 02:01:29,407
Give me the smile, come on.
You're not gonna let me leave

1607
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:31,993
without that beautiful smile
on your face. Give me the sun.

1608
02:01:32,076 --> 02:01:34,162
- Give me the shine.
- But, Louis, I'm scared.

1609
02:01:34,245 --> 02:01:39,042
Please. Please, shine for me.
Please. Please. Come on.

1610
02:01:42,879 --> 02:01:44,297
Call me right away.

1611
02:02:13,868 --> 02:02:18,373
<i>You've forgotten the words</i>

1612
02:02:19,207 --> 02:02:22,085
<i>I love you</i>

1613
02:02:23,753 --> 02:02:26,172
<i>Each memory</i>

1614
02:02:26,548 --> 02:02:29,133
<i>That we've shared</i>

1615
02:02:31,678 --> 02:02:37,851
<i>You ignore every star above you</i>

1616
02:02:40,061 --> 02:02:46,109
<i>I can't realize you ever cared</i>

1617
02:02:47,652 --> 02:02:52,740
<i>You've changed</i>

1618
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:58,830
<i>You're not the angel I once knew</i>

1619
02:03:01,833 --> 02:03:07,881
<i>No need to tell me that we're through</i>

1620
02:03:10,091 --> 02:03:14,721
<i>It's all over now</i>

1621
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:21,603
<i>You've changed</i>

1622
02:03:25,106 --> 02:03:27,817
We're in Hollywood, baby.
We're gonna be in the movies.

1623
02:03:27,901 --> 02:03:30,904
That's right. We're gonna be famous.
You're gonna be a star, right?

1624
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:32,739
We'll team up.
We'll be great together.

1625
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:33,990
I'll be like Valentino.

1626
02:03:34,073 --> 02:03:35,617
You be like...

1627
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:38,369
We be like Valentino
and What's-her-name. You know?

1628
02:03:38,453 --> 02:03:39,495
Me and you, baby.

1629
02:03:39,579 --> 02:03:43,416
- It's going to be all right.
- I don't understand it.

1630
02:03:43,499 --> 02:03:45,960
It's been two months
since Louis left, right?

1631
02:03:46,044 --> 02:03:47,086
Yeah.

1632
02:03:47,170 --> 02:03:48,713
What the hell's
the matter with Bernie?

1633
02:03:48,796 --> 02:03:50,423
He told me it wasn't gonna be
but two months.

1634
02:03:50,506 --> 02:03:52,759
We've been out here
seems like forever.

1635
02:03:53,426 --> 02:03:55,595
- Oh, my goodness.
- He is jive. You understand?

1636
02:03:55,678 --> 02:03:57,972
We've been working good hotels
and everything.

1637
02:03:58,056 --> 02:03:59,682
We've been getting good reviews,
and we...

1638
02:03:59,766 --> 02:04:02,268
I wanna get back to New York.
I wanna get home.

1639
02:04:02,852 --> 02:04:04,187
Don't worry about it.
It's gonna be cool.

1640
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:05,271
I know it's gonna work out.

1641
02:04:05,355 --> 02:04:07,148
You know why I know
it's gonna work out?

1642
02:04:07,231 --> 02:04:10,652
Because it's gonna work out.
We gonna play Carnegie Hall one day.

1643
02:04:10,735 --> 02:04:11,861
That's right.

1644
02:04:11,945 --> 02:04:16,616
It'd be the first Carnegie concert
with a 90-year-old old maid, me.

1645
02:04:16,699 --> 02:04:18,785
And a 92-year-old polygamist.
That's me.

1646
02:04:18,868 --> 02:04:20,912
'Cause I ain't gonna be
no old maid, you know.

1647
02:04:22,038 --> 02:04:23,206
Oh, boy.

1648
02:04:24,791 --> 02:04:27,251
We gonna just have to get
some connections, that's all.

1649
02:04:27,335 --> 02:04:29,087
We gonna have to get
some connections, that's all.

1650
02:04:29,170 --> 02:04:32,090
I got connections, baby.
Big connections.

1651
02:04:32,173 --> 02:04:34,133
- You got connections?
- That's right.

1652
02:04:34,717 --> 02:04:35,969
- Out here?
- Back.

1653
02:04:36,052 --> 02:04:38,054
- Out here in California?
- Yeah. Yes.

1654
02:04:38,137 --> 02:04:41,641
Okay, why don't you get some stuff?

1655
02:04:41,724 --> 02:04:46,479
I'm really depressed. I'm down and...
Come on, now.

1656
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,149
- Come on, Piano Man.
- Pay day's two days away.

1657
02:04:50,233 --> 02:04:51,609
I'm busted, right?

1658
02:04:51,693 --> 02:04:54,570
You ain't got no money, neither.
You talking about getting some stuff?

1659
02:04:56,406 --> 02:04:59,367
Okay, that's all right. Forget it.
I can get my own connections, then.

1660
02:05:01,119 --> 02:05:03,705
Lady, we've been
through this shit before, man.

1661
02:05:03,788 --> 02:05:04,789
You gonna mess up...

1662
02:05:04,872 --> 02:05:08,167
That's all right.
I just want a cop now, you know?

1663
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:09,877
No big thing.

1664
02:05:14,799 --> 02:05:17,176
Don't worry about it.
I'll do it myself.

1665
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:18,845
You know, I'll take care of it.

1666
02:05:18,928 --> 02:05:20,430
You ain't your brother's keeper,
you know?

1667
02:05:20,513 --> 02:05:22,348
Why don't you tell that nigger
you got in New York...

1668
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:23,933
I ain't your brother's keeper?

1669
02:05:25,268 --> 02:05:28,479
You can't get something for nothing
out here, girl. Did you know that?

1670
02:05:30,189 --> 02:05:31,816
I ain't trying to get
something for nothing.

1671
02:05:31,899 --> 02:05:32,942
What?

1672
02:05:33,026 --> 02:05:35,653
Just go on back to the hotel.
Go on back to the bungalow.

1673
02:05:35,737 --> 02:05:37,071
I'll meet you there later.

1674
02:05:38,031 --> 02:05:39,115
Billie.

1675
02:05:39,282 --> 02:05:41,325
I can handle it.
It's not the idea of that, man.

1676
02:05:41,409 --> 02:05:43,244
You're gonna get messed up
out here in the streets.

1677
02:05:43,327 --> 02:05:44,412
Why do you got to do that?

1678
02:05:44,495 --> 02:05:46,914
You're a star now. You understand?
You're big time.

1679
02:05:46,998 --> 02:05:50,043
You're gonna... I can get the stuff,
all right? I'll meet you...

1680
02:05:50,126 --> 02:05:52,170
- Now you're talking, big boy.
- Yeah, now.

1681
02:05:52,253 --> 02:05:53,838
- Okay.
- I'll meet you back at the hotel.

1682
02:05:53,921 --> 02:05:55,965
- About an hour, all right?
- All right.

1683
02:05:56,883 --> 02:05:57,967
Take this.

1684
02:05:58,134 --> 02:06:00,386
Come on, now take it.
Now, you know, you need some money.

1685
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:02,889
You can take this and pawn it.
We can get it back later.

1686
02:06:04,891 --> 02:06:07,143
- Hey, you know what?
- Chicken butt.

1687
02:06:12,356 --> 02:06:16,402
<i>Them that's got shall get</i>

1688
02:06:17,111 --> 02:06:21,282
<i>Them that's not shall lose</i>

1689
02:06:23,409 --> 02:06:26,496
<i>So the Bible says</i>

1690
02:06:26,579 --> 02:06:27,914
Play your harmonica.

1691
02:06:28,206 --> 02:06:33,336
<i>And it still is news</i>

1692
02:06:34,420 --> 02:06:38,674
<i>Mama, Mama may have</i>

1693
02:06:41,094 --> 02:06:43,763
<i>Papa may have</i>

1694
02:06:45,640 --> 02:06:49,477
<i>God bless the child</i>

1695
02:06:49,560 --> 02:06:52,688
<i>That's got his own</i>

1696
02:06:56,067 --> 02:06:59,612
You got your own harmonica.
I got my own harmonica.

1697
02:06:59,695 --> 02:07:01,531
I got my own high, too.

1698
02:07:02,406 --> 02:07:04,450
I knew you were trying
to hog the horse.

1699
02:07:05,701 --> 02:07:06,702
Hang on.

1700
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:08,871
Let me tell you something, you know...

1701
02:07:08,955 --> 02:07:10,790
How are we gonna...

1702
02:07:12,041 --> 02:07:14,210
Just a... Just a minute.

1703
02:07:14,293 --> 02:07:15,461
How we gonna be cool?

1704
02:07:15,545 --> 02:07:17,880
Piano Man, I've been trying
to tell you. You know what?

1705
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:21,717
My father was all right.
You know, he never did whip me?

1706
02:07:21,801 --> 02:07:24,762
You wanna know why?
'Cause he wasn't there.

1707
02:07:26,848 --> 02:07:28,933
- He left my mama.
- It's me, man.

1708
02:07:29,016 --> 02:07:31,060
We coming, Me.

1709
02:07:31,144 --> 02:07:32,895
- Who is that?
- Me, it's Me.

1710
02:07:32,979 --> 02:07:36,190
- That's you at the door?
- That's what the man said, "It's Me."

1711
02:07:38,734 --> 02:07:40,486
Hey, Me, we're coming.

1712
02:07:40,778 --> 02:07:42,613
- Yes.
- Say...

1713
02:07:42,697 --> 02:07:46,367
We gotta be cool, man.
Shit, it might be the man.

1714
02:07:47,785 --> 02:07:49,537
- That's right.
- The man.

1715
02:07:49,620 --> 02:07:53,332
That's the man.
I ain't talking about, you know?

1716
02:07:53,416 --> 02:07:55,710
- Say, man.
- Herbie Emma Savits.

1717
02:07:55,793 --> 02:07:59,380
- "Say, man."
- Who is it? Is this Me or Say Man?

1718
02:07:59,463 --> 02:08:01,090
It's Jimmy.

1719
02:08:01,883 --> 02:08:03,593
Come on, open the door.

1720
02:08:04,177 --> 02:08:06,846
Hey, Piano Man. Piano Man.

1721
02:08:06,929 --> 02:08:09,056
That might be the man.
I better go and clean up.

1722
02:08:09,140 --> 02:08:11,559
Just a minute, we coming. Hold on.

1723
02:08:12,810 --> 02:08:14,520
- Come on, man.
- Tell him that...

1724
02:08:14,604 --> 02:08:15,980
Just a minute.

1725
02:08:16,063 --> 02:08:19,192
We have to...
We have to flush the toilet.

1726
02:08:28,034 --> 02:08:30,203
Okay, wait a minute.

1727
02:08:33,789 --> 02:08:35,541
Hey! Wait. Be...

1728
02:08:40,004 --> 02:08:41,964
Hey, who is it?

1729
02:08:42,048 --> 02:08:45,092
- Hey, it's Jim.
- Ain't nobody but me.

1730
02:08:45,176 --> 02:08:47,595
All right. Just a minute.

1731
02:08:48,888 --> 02:08:50,598
- Jim.
- Right.

1732
02:08:50,681 --> 02:08:53,643
It's just Jim, baby.
Jim and me, I gotta...

1733
02:08:53,809 --> 02:08:55,937
- Who's Jim?
- He ain't the man, anyhow.

1734
02:08:56,270 --> 02:08:58,814
Hey, Jimmy, I want you to meet...

1735
02:08:58,898 --> 02:09:00,399
Come on, hey, Jimmy.

1736
02:09:00,483 --> 02:09:01,943
- Hey.
- Hi, Jimmy.

1737
02:09:02,026 --> 02:09:03,694
Listen, Jimmy, this is Lady.

1738
02:09:03,778 --> 02:09:06,656
Jimmy's the man.
Hey, man, this is Lady.

1739
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:09,158
Lady Day, this is Billie Holiday.

1740
02:09:09,242 --> 02:09:11,494
You know what I mean? The star.

1741
02:09:11,577 --> 02:09:13,871
- I wanna talk to you, Piano Man.
- Sure, man.

1742
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:15,748
Have a seat.
Why don't you guys come on in?

1743
02:09:15,831 --> 02:09:17,917
- You want a taste? You want a taste?
- Excuse me, ma'am.

1744
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:19,502
Something? A little drink?

1745
02:09:19,585 --> 02:09:22,588
Hey, Piano Man, my man here says that

1746
02:09:22,672 --> 02:09:24,590
you and him
got some business to take care of.

1747
02:09:24,674 --> 02:09:26,634
I was coming back. You know what?

1748
02:09:27,176 --> 02:09:30,221
Man, you said you was gonna
drop right on back, baby,

1749
02:09:30,304 --> 02:09:31,889
and you didn't make it.
Now that ain't no way to act.

1750
02:09:31,973 --> 02:09:33,307
I got something for you, though.
No, I know.

1751
02:09:33,391 --> 02:09:35,434
- Piano Man, who is these guys?
- Let's not... Billie.

1752
02:09:35,518 --> 02:09:37,353
Well, look, baby, I'll tell you.

1753
02:09:37,478 --> 02:09:39,855
No, wait.
Damn. Now, wait a minute, man.

1754
02:09:39,939 --> 02:09:41,232
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1755
02:09:41,315 --> 02:09:43,067
I'll give you the ring.
You can take my ring.

1756
02:09:43,150 --> 02:09:44,193
Wait...

1757
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,492
Billie!

1758
02:09:51,575 --> 02:09:54,745
- What are you doing to Piano Man?
- God damn it, Billie!

1759
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:58,082
- What are y'all doing with him?
- Billie! God!

1760
02:10:00,418 --> 02:10:01,752
No, Billie, please.

1761
02:10:01,836 --> 02:10:02,837
Get up.

1762
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,506
Wait a minute, listen.
Look, I got the shit.

1763
02:10:08,634 --> 02:10:10,261
You can't steal from us
like that, man.

1764
02:10:23,399 --> 02:10:25,693
They're gonna kill me. Billie!

1765
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:29,196
Let him up.

1766
02:10:29,864 --> 02:10:32,992
- Billie.
- What did you do?

1767
02:10:35,661 --> 02:10:37,496
- I think we better get out of here.
- Yeah.

1768
02:10:41,667 --> 02:10:44,670
Golly. Golly.

1769
02:10:47,214 --> 02:10:51,260
Piano Man, look at you.
You're bleeding all over.

1770
02:10:51,344 --> 02:10:52,970
Piano Man.

1771
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:57,058
Piano Man,
what you doing with this ring?

1772
02:10:57,683 --> 02:11:00,561
You are always trying to be a hero,
Piano Man.

1773
02:11:00,644 --> 02:11:02,813
You were supposed to pawn
this goddamn ring.

1774
02:11:02,897 --> 02:11:05,066
Is that why the men beat you?

1775
02:11:08,569 --> 02:11:10,571
You're still my friend.

1776
02:11:13,157 --> 02:11:15,785
<i>God bless the child</i>

1777
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:18,579
<i>That's got his own</i>

1778
02:11:19,538 --> 02:11:22,249
<i>That's got his own</i>

1779
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:26,212
<i>Mama may have</i>

1780
02:11:26,837 --> 02:11:31,634
Help, Mommy! Mama, help me!
Somebody, help me!

1781
02:11:35,888 --> 02:11:41,435
Piano Man! Wait a minute.
Piano Man, wait a minute.

1782
02:11:41,519 --> 02:11:42,853
Jesus.

1783
02:11:44,980 --> 02:11:49,610
Piano Man, you ain't dead, are you?
Don't die, Piano Man.

1784
02:11:52,571 --> 02:11:55,616
Piano Man is dead,
and everything is out of it here.

1785
02:11:56,283 --> 02:11:57,493
We got it.

1786
02:11:58,869 --> 02:12:01,372
We got Carnegie Hall.

1787
02:12:03,791 --> 02:12:05,418
Billie, did you hear me?

1788
02:12:06,627 --> 02:12:09,463
We finally got Carnegie Hall.

1789
02:12:10,798 --> 02:12:12,299
Billie, I can't hear you.

1790
02:12:13,676 --> 02:12:15,553
Turn that damn radio off.

1791
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:18,264
We must have a bad connection.

1792
02:12:19,765 --> 02:12:21,350
Did you hear me, Billie?

1793
02:12:24,311 --> 02:12:25,521
Wait a minute.

1794
02:12:26,063 --> 02:12:28,107
There's something wrong.
She sounds real funny.

1795
02:12:28,190 --> 02:12:29,692
What are you talking about?
Let me have that.

1796
02:12:29,775 --> 02:12:31,861
Billie, this is Louis. Look...

1797
02:12:33,487 --> 02:12:36,240
What's going on? You okay?

1798
02:12:36,490 --> 02:12:39,493
Louis, I'm scared out here.

1799
02:12:39,577 --> 02:12:42,746
Something scary is happening to me.

1800
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:47,084
What the hell is going on out there?

1801
02:12:48,878 --> 02:12:50,254
See, we...

1802
02:12:50,337 --> 02:12:51,547
See, we...

1803
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:55,092
See, we can't do everything
by ourselves.

1804
02:12:59,305 --> 02:13:02,266
- Is that the boyfriend?
- There he is. That's him.

1805
02:13:11,942 --> 02:13:13,944
I can't talk to you right now.

1806
02:13:14,653 --> 02:13:15,863
I don't know. I don't know.

1807
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:21,494
Billie?

1808
02:13:23,621 --> 02:13:25,998
Who is it? Leave me alone, go away.

1809
02:13:26,081 --> 02:13:29,335
Billie, open the door.
Billie, it's Louis. Open the door.

1810
02:13:29,418 --> 02:13:33,589
- Who?
- Billie, it's Louis!

1811
02:13:35,007 --> 02:13:36,008
Louis?

1812
02:13:37,843 --> 02:13:39,053
Open the door.

1813
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:43,807
Is that you, Louis?

1814
02:13:50,814 --> 02:13:52,024
It's me, baby.

1815
02:13:54,109 --> 02:13:56,654
Hey, Billie,
can we talk to you for a second?

1816
02:14:03,994 --> 02:14:05,538
Billie, can we talk to you a minute?

1817
02:14:05,621 --> 02:14:07,248
Yeah, come on out and talk to us.

1818
02:14:12,461 --> 02:14:16,840
I knew you'd come, Louis.
I knew you'd come.

1819
02:14:21,053 --> 02:14:22,888
I've been waiting for you.

1820
02:14:31,522 --> 02:14:33,482
Why is it so dark in here?

1821
02:14:35,985 --> 02:14:37,152
You all right?

1822
02:14:46,412 --> 02:14:47,496
What happened?

1823
02:14:53,252 --> 02:14:55,713
Baby, it's all right. Listen. Listen.

1824
02:14:58,340 --> 02:15:01,302
I love you, Louis.
You love me, don't you?

1825
02:15:01,385 --> 02:15:03,554
I knew you were gonna come. See?

1826
02:15:03,637 --> 02:15:06,557
Listen, baby, what happened?
What happened to Piano Man?

1827
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:10,769
What's the matter with you?

1828
02:15:13,981 --> 02:15:15,274
Then why are you so...

1829
02:15:24,033 --> 02:15:26,118
I'm fine, see?

1830
02:15:26,201 --> 02:15:29,204
Everything's... Everything's fine.

1831
02:15:30,289 --> 02:15:31,624
I don't know.

1832
02:15:31,749 --> 02:15:35,210
See, these men, they followed me
from the inquest and...

1833
02:15:37,546 --> 02:15:39,548
Bothered me and everything, and...

1834
02:15:41,467 --> 02:15:43,344
This is all right, baby.
It's all right.

1835
02:15:43,427 --> 02:15:46,597
Listen, it's all over now.

1836
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:52,019
Piano Man is dead
and there's nothing...

1837
02:15:52,102 --> 02:15:55,147
We can't do anything about it,
but you're you.

1838
02:15:55,356 --> 02:15:57,775
You got to keep on living.
Now, you gotta...

1839
02:15:57,858 --> 02:15:59,276
Piano Man's dead.

1840
02:15:59,360 --> 02:16:01,070
Yeah, you got a lot
of hard work ahead of you now.

1841
02:16:01,153 --> 02:16:02,571
I mean, you gotta work hard.

1842
02:16:02,655 --> 02:16:04,531
You gotta put your mind
on work, you know?

1843
02:16:04,615 --> 02:16:06,742
You got Carnegie Hall
to think about now.

1844
02:16:07,409 --> 02:16:09,536
I'm gonna get you home.
I'm gonna get you home.

1845
02:16:09,620 --> 02:16:13,624
- Yeah, you know, Piano Man is dead.
- Yeah, I do.

1846
02:16:14,333 --> 02:16:18,712
See, Louis, I wish I was dead.

1847
02:16:18,796 --> 02:16:20,506
- Billie...
- I know.

1848
02:16:20,589 --> 02:16:22,049
- See...
- I'm gonna go pack your things now,

1849
02:16:22,132 --> 02:16:23,342
all right?

1850
02:16:24,885 --> 02:16:26,470
It's not... I'm really...

1851
02:16:26,553 --> 02:16:28,889
See, Louis, I'm no good...

1852
02:16:29,598 --> 02:16:31,225
I don't...

1853
02:16:32,810 --> 02:16:35,813
See, Piano Man was right over there...
Louis?

1854
02:16:39,400 --> 02:16:41,777
I knew you'd come
and take care of me, see?

1855
02:16:44,988 --> 02:16:48,117
Hey, Louis, get me out of here, huh?

1856
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:51,745
I've been waiting for you, I...
You took so long to come by, and...

1857
02:16:51,829 --> 02:16:53,247
But...

1858
02:16:53,455 --> 02:16:56,041
Why do those guys keep bothering me?

1859
02:16:56,625 --> 02:16:58,627
I don't know them.

1860
02:16:59,378 --> 02:17:02,297
- Here you are, baby.
- I don't care, anyway.

1861
02:17:03,632 --> 02:17:06,301
Come on, take your hat now.
We're going home, okay?

1862
02:17:07,219 --> 02:17:08,220
We're going home.

1863
02:17:08,303 --> 02:17:11,974
- We're going home.
- Yeah, we're going home, all right?

1864
02:17:12,349 --> 02:17:13,642
I'm going home, right?

1865
02:17:13,726 --> 02:17:15,352
Okay, you put your hat on.
We're going home.

1866
02:17:15,561 --> 02:17:19,148
Take the train right on into New York,
right into Penn Station, okay?

1867
02:17:19,231 --> 02:17:21,024
How much time we got? You wanna...

1868
02:17:21,692 --> 02:17:25,529
We can do that on the train, okay?
Let's go. Heading to Carnegie Hall.

1869
02:17:26,321 --> 02:17:29,450
There you go. Come on, baby.

02:17:29,533 --> 02:17:31,368

02:17:39,668 --> 02:17:41,044
Louis.

1874
02:17:41,128 --> 02:17:42,171
- What, baby?
- Do you love me?

1875
02:17:42,254 --> 02:17:44,381
I love you. Yes, I love you.

1876
02:17:45,674 --> 02:17:47,342
I love you. Now, come on, let's go.

1877
02:17:47,426 --> 02:17:50,637
And you gonna be with me?
See, because...

1878
02:17:52,848 --> 02:17:56,518
I'm a good girl. I don't mean...
I didn't mean to do things...

1879
02:17:56,602 --> 02:18:00,564
I know. I know, but let's...
Why don't we get out of here now?

1880
02:18:00,647 --> 02:18:02,941
Go on, now, go on.
Let's get the train.

1881
02:18:03,025 --> 02:18:04,026
Okay.

1882
02:18:04,109 --> 02:18:05,652
Straight into
Pennsylvania Station, okay?

1883
02:18:05,736 --> 02:18:06,779
Okay.

1884
02:18:06,862 --> 02:18:09,531
- Go back to New York, see? New York.
- Yeah.

1885
02:18:09,615 --> 02:18:12,367
- Home.
- Home. Home.

1886
02:18:13,076 --> 02:18:15,412
- Come on.
- I'm gonna take my coat.

1887
02:18:15,496 --> 02:18:17,039
You take your coat. Okay.

1888
02:18:17,873 --> 02:18:19,416
Okay, I'll take my hat.

1889
02:18:20,709 --> 02:18:23,629
- I'll put your hat on you.
- Okay.

1890
02:18:26,590 --> 02:18:28,509
Thank you, baby. Thank you.

1891
02:18:28,592 --> 02:18:32,095
- Here it is. Right there.
- It's all over now, Billie.

1892
02:18:32,179 --> 02:18:33,722
It's all over.

1893
02:18:41,104 --> 02:18:43,774
Miss Holiday, could you give us
a statement about...

1894
02:18:43,857 --> 02:18:46,777
<i>Whatever my man is</i>

1895
02:18:47,861 --> 02:18:53,116
<i>I'm his for evermore</i>

1896
02:18:56,370 --> 02:19:00,916
<i>What's the difference if I say</i>

1897
02:19:00,999 --> 02:19:05,212
<i>I'll go away</i>

1898
02:19:05,295 --> 02:19:10,217
<i>When I know I'll come back on my knees</i>

1899
02:19:10,300 --> 02:19:12,719
<i>Some day</i>

1900
02:19:16,223 --> 02:19:22,521
<i>For whatever my man is</i>

1901
02:19:22,813 --> 02:19:27,276
<i>I'm his</i>

1902
02:19:27,359 --> 02:19:34,157
<i>Forevermore</i>

1903
02:19:55,053 --> 02:19:57,139
More, more!

1904
02:20:05,355 --> 02:20:07,399
They're still screaming out there.

1905
02:20:08,442 --> 02:20:11,236
Billie, you made it. I love you.

1906
02:20:11,320 --> 02:20:14,156
They love you. Listen to them scream.

1907
02:20:14,239 --> 02:20:15,574
I hear them. I hear them.

1908
02:20:15,657 --> 02:20:20,412
The walls are shaking.
They never seen anything like tonight.

1909
02:20:20,495 --> 02:20:23,332
It's fantastic.
Can I get my license now?

1910
02:20:23,415 --> 02:20:26,752
Are you kidding?
You've got all of New York City.

1911
02:20:26,835 --> 02:20:28,128
You're home.

1912
02:20:36,261 --> 02:20:38,305
Billie, you can't keep
Carnegie Hall waiting.

1913
02:20:38,388 --> 02:20:40,057
Okay, I'll do <i>God Bless the Child.</i>

1914
02:20:40,140 --> 02:20:41,683
<i>God Bless the Child.</i>

1915
02:20:41,767 --> 02:20:42,809
- Kill them, Billie.
- I love you.

1916
02:20:42,893 --> 02:20:45,103
- I love you, too.
- All right, later.

1917
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:10,379
<i>Them that's got shall get</i>

1918
02:21:11,630 --> 02:21:15,384
<i>Them that's not shall lose</i>

1919
02:21:16,301 --> 02:21:19,471
<i>So the Bible says</i>

1920
02:21:20,180 --> 02:21:23,892
<i>And it still is news</i>

1921
02:21:23,976 --> 02:21:26,937
<i>Mama may have</i>

1922
02:21:27,646 --> 02:21:31,066
<i>Papa may have</i>

1923
02:21:31,775 --> 02:21:34,569
<i>But God bless the child</i>

1924
02:21:34,653 --> 02:21:36,989
<i>That's got his own</i>

1925
02:21:37,906 --> 02:21:41,743
<i>That's got his own</i>

1926
02:21:44,955 --> 02:21:46,999
<i>Money</i>

1927
02:21:47,082 --> 02:21:53,213
<i>You got lots of friends</i>

1928
02:21:54,131 --> 02:22:00,095
<i>Crowding around the door</i>

1929
02:22:01,096 --> 02:22:04,558
<i>When it's gone</i>

1930
02:22:04,641 --> 02:22:08,228
<i>And spending ends</i>

1931
02:22:08,353 --> 02:22:12,649
<i>They don't come no more</i>

1932
02:22:13,984 --> 02:22:18,488
<i>Rich relations give</i>

1933
02:22:19,489 --> 02:22:23,618
<i>A crust of bread and such</i>

1934
02:22:24,786 --> 02:22:27,831
<i>You can help yourself</i>

1935
02:22:28,540 --> 02:22:32,377
<i>But don't take too much</i>

1936
02:22:32,878 --> 02:22:35,505
<i>Mama may have</i>

1937
02:22:36,381 --> 02:22:38,467
<i>Papa may have</i>

1938
02:22:39,468 --> 02:22:41,845
<i>But God bless the child</i>

1939
02:22:41,928 --> 02:22:44,639
<i>That's got his own</i>

1940
02:22:45,474 --> 02:22:51,480
<i>That's got his own</i>
