1
00:00:00,228 --> 00:00:01,946
Of course.

2
00:00:04,109 --> 00:00:06,223
I've just spoken to them.

3
00:00:06,268 --> 00:00:09,305
- And do they know what happened?
- No more than you read there.

4
00:00:09,348 --> 00:00:13,023
- And what speed?
- The fastest yet achieved anywhere on Earth.

5
00:00:18,748 --> 00:00:23,663
"Disintegrated... Wreckage lies
scattered over a mile-wide area. "

6
00:00:25,469 --> 00:00:28,505
It looks as if it really
had exploded in the air.

7
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:32,780
- But they must know more than this.
- They don't. There's nothing left to tell.

8
00:00:32,828 --> 00:00:36,058
- They may have hit something.
- Aye, he hit something all right.

9
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:38,259
He hit the speed of sound.

10
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:42,665
Well, it looks as if I might
have been wrong after all.

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:47,658
Cos you can't get through this thing. That
was a great aircraft, flown by a great pilot.

12
00:00:47,708 --> 00:00:49,859
- Yes, I know.
- Well...

13
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,818
Do we go on?

14
00:00:57,388 --> 00:00:59,504
Well, that's for you to decide, isn't it?

15
00:01:00,909 --> 00:01:02,864
Yes, I suppose it is.

16
00:01:03,867 --> 00:01:06,666
I wanted to know how you feel about it.

17
00:01:08,228 --> 00:01:14,224
Could we get a full report on all this
and could I look at it? It might help us.

18
00:01:14,268 --> 00:01:17,784
Oh, and if you're sending a wire,
you might put my name on it too.

19
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:23,099
He was a good bloke, old Geoffrey.

20
00:01:31,428 --> 00:01:35,546
I'd better say it at once. I'm going
on with this sound-barrier business.

21
00:01:36,788 --> 00:01:38,700
Why, Tony?

22
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:43,827
It's difficult to explain. I... just
feel it's got to be done, that's all.

23
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,421
By you?

24
00:01:47,468 --> 00:01:49,265
Yes, by me.

25
00:01:55,307 --> 00:01:57,299
Was... he married?

26
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:07,579
Yes, I believe he was.

27
00:02:10,388 --> 00:02:14,142
Is there anything I can say
that will stop you, Tony?

28
00:02:14,188 --> 00:02:16,179
No, Sue. Nothing.

29
00:02:17,188 --> 00:02:20,180
Don't you see, I... I
can't let the show down now.

30
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:23,938
Let the show down? Is there no thought
in your mind of letting me down, or him?

31
00:02:23,988 --> 00:02:27,583
- Oh, Sue.
- If only I could understand, Tony.

32
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:30,095
But I can't, you see.

33
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:34,699
I can only see a great wall in the sky
strong enough to smash an aircraft to pieces.

34
00:02:34,748 --> 00:02:36,978
And beyond it, nothing.

35
00:02:37,028 --> 00:02:39,019
Nothing at all.

36
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:44,099
I'm sorry, Sue.

37
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:54,344
Darling...

38
00:02:54,388 --> 00:02:59,746
I promised to speak to Dad and ask him whether
I mightn't give up this job, but after...

39
00:02:59,787 --> 00:03:01,619
Well, after this, how could I?

40
00:03:01,669 --> 00:03:04,705
Don't you see what he'd
have felt about me if I had?

41
00:03:04,748 --> 00:03:07,343
I've heard those words before, Tony.

42
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:11,587
Christopher said them to me
the night before he was killed.

43
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:15,064
He was scared too Father
might think he was a coward.

44
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,905
Oh, it isn't that.

45
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:21,863
I just don't want him to think I'm ratting on
a job because someone else got killed doing it.

46
00:03:23,587 --> 00:03:26,341
- Where are you going?
- I can't face him tonight.

47
00:03:26,388 --> 00:03:27,980
Oh, darling.

48
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:29,700
Leave me alone.

49
00:03:36,948 --> 00:03:40,623
Oh, Sue is not feeling very
well. She's not coming down.

50
00:03:40,668 --> 00:03:42,545
Oh.

51
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,022
Sorry.

52
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:58,905
You know, when I first started flying,

53
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:05,547
some people, religious people,
thought what we were doing was wrong.

54
00:04:05,588 --> 00:04:08,898
They thought it was breaking a law of nature.

55
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,463
Sounds funny now, of
course, but they used to say,

56
00:04:12,508 --> 00:04:15,500
"If God had meant us to fly,
he'd have given us wings. "

57
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:19,906
Now, this sound barrier...

58
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:26,985
people might feel again that God had
put it there for his own good purpose.

59
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:29,462
That it can't be broken.

60
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,976
That it would be wrong to try.

61
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:39,346
Now, I wouldn't blame anyone
who believed that. I...

62
00:04:39,389 --> 00:04:41,504
I wouldn't blame them at all.

63
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:47,784
- Do you believe that, Tony?
- No, Dad.

64
00:04:47,828 --> 00:04:50,979
If I believe anything,
it's the exact opposite.

65
00:04:52,628 --> 00:04:54,823
Oh, if only I were 30 years younger.

66
00:04:56,108 --> 00:04:59,418
Well, sorry about Sue. We'll
get Factor to send her up a tray.

67
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:01,379
Let's go in, shall we?

68
00:07:53,788 --> 00:07:56,939
Mummy, somebody at the door.

69
00:07:56,988 --> 00:07:58,943
Yes, dear, I know.

70
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:02,940
Oh, Sally, don't play on the
stairs, dear. I've told you before.

71
00:08:05,948 --> 00:08:09,180
- Hello, Jess. Am I disturbing you?
- No, of course not. Do come in.

72
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:12,026
I was shopping and I thought I'd drop in.

73
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:13,979
- Hello, Bobby.
- I made this.

74
00:08:14,028 --> 00:08:15,620
Oh, isn't that lovely.

75
00:08:15,668 --> 00:08:18,978
Jess, I wanted to speak to
Philip rather urgently. Is he in?

76
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,940
No, but he'll be back quite
soon, I expect. Let's go in here.

77
00:08:21,988 --> 00:08:24,741
Oh, I do think you've done this charmingly.

78
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:29,107
You know this is the house
I'd set my heart on, don't you?

79
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:32,106
Why did you want this when you've got
that big house almost to yourselves?

80
00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:34,104
I just did.

81
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:37,106
Here he is and I haven't got
the pie in the oven. Excuse me.

82
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,742
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, sweetie.

83
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,825
- Look who's here again. Isn't that nice?
- Oh.

84
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:43,780
I'm just getting lunch.

85
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:47,377
- Hello.
- Hello. I was passing and I thought...

86
00:08:47,428 --> 00:08:51,023
Well, it was a nice thought.
Come on, come and sit down.

87
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:54,663
- How was the flight?
- Wonderful. Tony was kind about my flying too.

88
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:57,063
- No regrets, then?
- None at all.

89
00:08:57,108 --> 00:08:59,622
Why does everyone I'm fond
of have to be a test pilot?

90
00:08:59,668 --> 00:09:01,739
Why can't they sit in offices
like the rest of humanity?

91
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:04,507
The rest of humanity doesn't
know what it's missing.

92
00:09:10,148 --> 00:09:14,300
When Tony's flying these days...
I try to go to the cinema.

93
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:17,776
You can't hear the sound so clearly in there.

94
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:21,941
Philip...

95
00:09:21,988 --> 00:09:23,866
How does Jess feel about all this?

96
00:09:23,908 --> 00:09:27,458
Oh, I think she accepts it
just as a job like any other.

97
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:31,023
I wish I were like Jess. I'm
not very brave, I'm afraid.

98
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,338
When's he testing the
Prometheus at full speed?

99
00:09:36,388 --> 00:09:37,980
I don't know.

100
00:09:38,028 --> 00:09:41,384
You do, I think. But perhaps
it's best you shouldn't tell.

101
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:48,102
- What's he doing at this minute?
- He's up for half an hour on a routine test.

102
00:09:48,148 --> 00:09:51,458
- Will you stay for lunch?
- Oh, won't that be difficult for Jess?

103
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:53,419
- Has she enough?
- She'll manage somehow.

104
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,982
Susan, you mustn't worry, you know.

105
00:09:57,428 --> 00:09:59,579
There's no better pilot in this country.

106
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:07,221
Philip, I believe to have courage,
one must also have understanding.

107
00:10:07,268 --> 00:10:09,735
If only I could understand
the purpose of it all.

108
00:10:11,868 --> 00:10:15,747
You know, I don't think that sort
of understanding comes from up here.

109
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,221
Only from here.

110
00:10:19,548 --> 00:10:22,506
Jess, lay on another place, will
you? Susan's staying for lunch.

111
00:10:25,348 --> 00:10:29,023
- Well?
- Tomorrow at 3:00.

112
00:10:29,068 --> 00:10:31,059
- What, the full test?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:35,219
That's good work, Will.

114
00:10:36,547 --> 00:10:39,426
She's still nose-heavy over Mach 9.0.

115
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:44,496
- Well, give up the test if you're worried.
- Of course I'm worried! Wouldn't you be?

116
00:10:44,548 --> 00:10:48,257
Tony says it's not serious.
He can correct easily.

117
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:50,537
He doesn't want to wait any longer. Nor do I.

118
00:10:50,587 --> 00:10:53,056
- You need a rest, Will.
- Of course I need a rest!

119
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:56,180
I've needed a rest for over 35 years.

120
00:10:56,229 --> 00:10:58,697
- Give me a drink.
- You know where to find it.

121
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:09,297
- Where is Tony now?
- He's over with the new test pilot.

122
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:12,703
That boy's a good flyer, by the
way. Tony says he's better than him.

123
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:14,784
That's not true. No one's better than Tony.

124
00:11:16,229 --> 00:11:18,219
Tony hasn't got it up here.

125
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:23,377
That's what a pilot needs
nowadays. Brains and imagination.

126
00:11:23,428 --> 00:11:27,705
- Isn't that what they've always needed?
- Maybe. Well, here's hoping.

127
00:11:46,548 --> 00:11:49,824
- Well, what is it, Dad?
- A galaxy in Andromeda.

128
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:57,504
- And how far away is that?
- Oh, about 700,000 light years.

129
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:02,019
You mean that what I am seeing now is the
way this galaxy looked 700,000 years ago?

130
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,626
That's right.

131
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:04,986
Hm.

132
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:09,657
- I'm looking at the past, then, aren't I?
- In a manner of speaking.

133
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:13,502
Is there a way of looking into the future?

134
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,377
- Yes.
- How?

135
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:22,105
Through that telescope. What you see there is
the past, the present and the future, all in one.

136
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,423
The process of continuous creation.

137
00:12:26,468 --> 00:12:29,505
Stars die, stars are born.

138
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:32,187
No beginning, no end.

139
00:12:32,228 --> 00:12:34,982
Yes, you can see into the
future out there, all right.

140
00:12:37,868 --> 00:12:41,178
- Nice hobby you've got here.
- Passes the time.

141
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:43,220
- Well, good night.
- Tony?

142
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:49,502
- You hardly knew Christopher, did you?
- Well, just that one night.

143
00:12:50,428 --> 00:12:53,146
Susan blames me for his death, doesn't she?

144
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:57,182
Oh, that you needn't answer. I know she does.

145
00:12:58,188 --> 00:13:00,179
I just wondered if you blame me too.

146
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:03,617
You can tell me the truth, I can take it.

147
00:13:04,788 --> 00:13:07,144
Do you, Tony?

148
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,178
No.

149
00:13:09,268 --> 00:13:12,225
Hm. Well, good night, Tony boy.

150
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:15,696
Happy landings for tomorrow.

151
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:17,339
Piece of cake.

152
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:32,460
Oh, sorry, darling. I
didn't mean to wake you.

153
00:13:34,469 --> 00:13:37,743
- You're very late, Tony.
- I've been gassing with the old man.

154
00:13:38,749 --> 00:13:40,578
Are you flying tomorrow?

155
00:13:41,909 --> 00:13:43,899
Just the usual bumble around.

156
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,659
- What time?
- Three o'clock.

157
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:51,819
- I'll see that film at the Palace.
- Mm.

158
00:13:51,868 --> 00:13:53,699
It's a good one, I hear.

159
00:13:54,828 --> 00:13:56,420
- Darling?
- Mm-hm?

160
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,698
Do you mind if we call him John?

161
00:14:01,747 --> 00:14:03,420
I think I do.

162
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,539
- Good night.
- Good night, my love.

163
00:14:12,428 --> 00:14:14,100
- Pity.
- What?

164
00:14:14,148 --> 00:14:17,299
- That I didn't meet you ten years ago.
- Why?

165
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:20,225
I'd have had ten years longer
of being married to you.

166
00:14:21,227 --> 00:14:22,818
- Good night.
- Good night.

167
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:36,540
Tony?

168
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,141
Oh, Tony.

169
00:14:45,987 --> 00:14:50,185
Crash crew, this is Control,
testing. How do you hear me?

170
00:14:50,228 --> 00:14:54,903
Roger. Stand by in crash
position on runway 2-0.

171
00:14:54,948 --> 00:14:56,939
- Good afternoon.
- Hello.

172
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:51,585
<i>Ridgefield Tower from Glass
Jar 1-0. Clear for take-off?</i>

173
00:15:51,627 --> 00:15:53,027
1-0. Clear to go.

174
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,581
Roger.

175
00:17:13,267 --> 00:17:16,384
<i>Ridgefield Tower, this is Glass Jar 1-0.</i>

176
00:17:16,428 --> 00:17:23,220
<i>I'm going up to 40,000 and dive her first
at a Mach number of about 0.95 or 0.96.</i>

177
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:26,305
<i>- Roger, 1-0. - Coming
in over the airfield now.</i>

178
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:30,178
1-0 to Tower. Flying level. 30,000 feet.

179
00:18:30,227 --> 00:18:31,944
Conditions pretty near perfect.

180
00:18:31,987 --> 00:18:33,978
Visibility unlimited.

181
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:38,018
I'm going up another ten to 40,000.

182
00:19:12,548 --> 00:19:15,300
40,000, straight and level.

183
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,696
Outside air temperature, 50 below.

184
00:19:20,468 --> 00:19:24,064
Revs 12.5, ASl 380 knots.

185
00:19:24,108 --> 00:19:25,745
OK, here we go.

186
00:19:42,828 --> 00:19:44,260
0.90.

187
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,775
No buffeting, trim correct, increasing speed.

188
00:19:52,268 --> 00:19:54,178
Nine four.

189
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,776
Nine five.

190
00:19:57,668 --> 00:19:59,546
Buffeting, nose-heavy, trimming back.

191
00:20:06,948 --> 00:20:09,941
Port wing dropping. Air
brakes open. Throttling back.

192
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:32,266
<i>OK. At that speed, nothing serious.</i>

193
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:35,186
<i>Behaviour normal, apart from nosing down.</i>

194
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:38,697
<i>Right, I'm going up to 40,000
feet again for the full go.</i>

195
00:20:46,868 --> 00:20:52,022
Hello, Tony, this is Will. Did you correct
that nose-heavy trim before opening air brakes?

196
00:20:52,828 --> 00:20:56,787
All right, Will, you old hen. Everything
you said would happen did happen.

197
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:57,862
All in order, don't fuss.

198
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:00,581
What about your nose-heavy
trim? Did you correct?

199
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:04,258
<i>Of course I corrected. I told you
I was climbing again, didn't I?</i>

200
00:21:35,268 --> 00:21:38,340
OK, 40,000. Straight and level.

201
00:21:39,668 --> 00:21:41,149
All set.

202
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:43,179
Hang on a minute.

203
00:21:52,588 --> 00:21:54,624
Here we go. This is it.

204
00:22:26,707 --> 00:22:27,777
Nine-five.

205
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,779
Buffeting. Nose heavy.

206
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,219
Trimming back.

207
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,384
Nine-six.

208
00:22:36,428 --> 00:22:37,907
Nine-seven.

209
00:22:39,949 --> 00:22:41,826
Nine-eight.

210
00:22:41,868 --> 00:22:44,586
25,000. Very nose-heavy.

211
00:22:44,627 --> 00:22:45,618
Air brakes open.

212
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:55,744
The controls don't respond! I can't hold her!

213
00:22:56,949 --> 00:22:57,937
Nine-nine!

214
00:23:03,748 --> 00:23:05,898
<i>- Still no response!
- Bail out.</i>

215
00:23:05,948 --> 00:23:07,620
It's coming up to Mach One!

216
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:12,417
Bail out. Bail out.

217
00:23:18,068 --> 00:23:20,263
<i>Tony!</i>

218
00:23:27,028 --> 00:23:28,746
Crash, square able 7.

219
00:25:30,108 --> 00:25:31,780
Get back!

220
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:41,017
- Why did you come here?
- I wanted to.

221
00:25:41,068 --> 00:25:42,660
I wanted to.

222
00:25:45,708 --> 00:25:46,982
Halt!

223
00:25:54,226 --> 00:25:56,297
Here, you'd better sit down.

224
00:25:58,628 --> 00:26:01,859
- Is... Is Father here?
- No.

225
00:26:03,067 --> 00:26:05,787
He was here for an hour
or more, but he's gone now.

226
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,944
Oh, Will.

227
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,856
I don't know what to say to you,
Susie, love. I don't know what to say.

228
00:26:15,869 --> 00:26:21,307
I can't go on, of course. I've had
my fill of designing aeroplanes.

229
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:25,785
Still I don't know where it
went wrong. I can't fathom it.

230
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,899
Oh, I suppose I've got too old.

231
00:26:31,587 --> 00:26:33,580
What are you going to do?

232
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:37,860
I don't know. I... hadn't thought.

233
00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:44,261
- I must go somewhere, I think.
- No, Susie love, please, don't.

234
00:26:44,308 --> 00:26:51,225
I'm thinking of JR. I know how things are
between you, but don't leave him alone now.

235
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:53,145
Not for a bit, anyway.

236
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,617
I must go now, Will.

237
00:26:59,148 --> 00:27:02,060
Please don't blame yourself.

238
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:05,817
Tony knew... he was up against
something he couldn't beat.

239
00:27:07,668 --> 00:27:09,898
Come on, I'd better take you home.

240
00:27:45,128 --> 00:27:46,527
<i>All set.</i>

241
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:48,559
<i>Hang on a minute.</i>

242
00:27:49,488 --> 00:27:51,479
<i>Here we go. This is it.</i>

243
00:27:58,847 --> 00:28:00,679
<i>Nine-five.</i>

244
00:28:00,729 --> 00:28:03,322
<i>Buffeting. Nose-heavy.</i>

245
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:06,087
<i>Trimming back.</i>

246
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:08,245
<i>Nine-six.</i>

247
00:28:08,288 --> 00:28:10,120
<i>Nine-seven.</i>

248
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,201
<i>Nine-eight.</i>

249
00:28:13,248 --> 00:28:16,320
<i>Down to 25,000. Very nose-heavy.</i>

250
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:18,486
<i>Air brakes open.</i>

251
00:28:19,809 --> 00:28:23,403
<i>The controls don't respond. I can't hold her!</i>

252
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:24,881
<i>Nine nine!</i>

253
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:27,163
<i>Still no response.</i>

254
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,484
<i>- Bail out.
- Coming up to Mach One!</i>

255
00:28:30,528 --> 00:28:32,995
<i>Bail out. Bail out!</i>

256
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:44,079
- Sue.
- Jess.

257
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,046
Get Dr Peyton, Philip.

258
00:28:52,088 --> 00:28:54,079
Come along, we'll go upstairs.

259
00:29:57,009 --> 00:29:59,045
- It is a boy, isn't it?
- Yes.

260
00:30:27,568 --> 00:30:29,559
Oh, it's Tony.

261
00:30:36,068 --> 00:30:38,536
- Name this child.
- John Anthony.

262
00:30:38,588 --> 00:30:42,821
John Anthony, I baptise you
in the name of the Father,

263
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:45,257
and of the Son,

264
00:30:45,308 --> 00:30:48,060
and of the Holy Ghost, amen.

265
00:30:49,388 --> 00:30:51,423
Now, smile, please.

266
00:30:52,468 --> 00:30:55,029
He's here. The car's outside.
Oh dear, I hoped he wouldn't.

267
00:30:55,068 --> 00:30:56,978
Oh, don't panic, Jess.

268
00:31:00,828 --> 00:31:02,943
Ah, how do you do?

269
00:31:08,149 --> 00:31:10,821
- Well, hello, Sue.
- Hello, Father.

270
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:13,017
Hello, young fella.

271
00:31:13,067 --> 00:31:15,901
- Did you christen him Tony?
- No, John.

272
00:31:17,068 --> 00:31:19,707
It was what Tony wanted.

273
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:22,058
Hm. He's a fine baby.

274
00:31:22,107 --> 00:31:23,462
Yes, isn't he?

275
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:28,581
- Oh, Sir John, can I tempt you to this?
- Oh, thank you. It's a charming house you have.

276
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:31,187
Glad you like it, Sir John.

277
00:31:31,228 --> 00:31:33,822
I haven't had a chance yet
of congratulating you, Father.

278
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:35,938
Mm. Quite a surprise.

279
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:39,823
- I hear the new airliner's is a great success.
- Mm. We hope so.

280
00:31:39,868 --> 00:31:43,303
Now, here's a small present for... John.

281
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:45,138
Thank you.

282
00:31:47,108 --> 00:31:52,024
The Chinaman, he says, "Me no likey
plitty lady. Me likey plitty drinky. "

283
00:31:52,069 --> 00:31:54,820
- Hello, Will.
- Hello, JR.

284
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,587
Delighted to see you looking better.

285
00:31:56,629 --> 00:31:59,461
- How was Bognor?
- Oh, very restful, very quiet.

286
00:31:59,508 --> 00:32:01,181
- I'm glad you're back.
- I'm not back.

287
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:02,741
Oh.

288
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:07,703
Well, when you're at Bognor, you might
have a look at this. I'd like your views.

289
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:12,025
- Byfield's work?
- Yes.

290
00:32:12,068 --> 00:32:15,105
- What's his idea in that?
- To increase stability.

291
00:32:16,828 --> 00:32:23,983
The way I see it, JR, a good aircraft has... It's
got to have something sort of... inevitable about it.

292
00:32:24,027 --> 00:32:29,545
Now, look. This thing could be changed
a hundred different ways. For example...

293
00:32:29,588 --> 00:32:33,103
Do you know what you are,
JR? You're a vile seducer.

294
00:32:35,068 --> 00:32:39,266
Oh, by the way, I hear you've
made a... new Prometheus.

295
00:32:40,508 --> 00:32:43,102
- What's the idea?
- It's too good an aircraft to lose, Will.

296
00:32:43,148 --> 00:32:46,265
It's the best that came out
of England since the war.

297
00:32:46,309 --> 00:32:50,984
- No. It failed, JR.
- It wasn't the aircraft that failed, Will.

298
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:55,060
Now, you come and see me on Monday.

299
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:16,707
Well, this may not be the time to tell you,
but I've been watching your work very closely,

300
00:33:16,748 --> 00:33:20,865
and now Makepeace is leaving us, I've
decided to promote you to chief test pilot.

301
00:33:20,906 --> 00:33:23,820
- Oh, thank you, Sir John.
- In the firm, I'm still known as JR.

302
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:26,940
- Take up the new Prometheus tomorrow.
- Yes, JR.

303
00:33:26,987 --> 00:33:30,344
Take her up every day for the next few weeks.
No specific tests, just get used to her.

304
00:33:30,389 --> 00:33:33,744
- Right.
- Goodbye and thank you. A charming party.

305
00:33:35,148 --> 00:33:40,063
Oh, and Peel? Not above Mach
9.0, until further orders.

306
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,344
- Philip?
- I think so.

307
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:42,738
Hello, darling.

308
00:34:43,788 --> 00:34:46,062
Come on. Up we get.

309
00:34:48,788 --> 00:34:52,497
- Has John been good?
- Yes. He doesn't seem to mind the noise at all.

310
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,582
- Jess?
- Mm-hm?

311
00:34:57,629 --> 00:35:02,656
You've both been very good to me here. I don't
think you'll ever realise how grateful I am.

312
00:35:02,709 --> 00:35:04,585
Why this all of a sudden?

313
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:06,664
I think I've got that flat in London.

314
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:09,586
Oh dear, I'm sorry. We
shall both miss you terribly.

315
00:35:09,628 --> 00:35:10,902
I shall miss you.

316
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:13,337
Couldn't you find something
a little nearer here?

317
00:35:13,387 --> 00:35:16,141
I don't want him to grow up in
the shadow of his grandfather.

318
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,506
Come on, darling.

319
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,462
- Why not stick the nose on the tail?
- I'll stick your nose on your tail.

320
00:35:40,987 --> 00:35:43,297
- Will?
- What?

321
00:35:43,348 --> 00:35:46,145
Is it possible that at the speed
of sound, the controls are reversed?

322
00:35:46,187 --> 00:35:49,897
At the speed of sound,
Philip, anything's possible.

323
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:51,301
Why?

324
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:54,339
During the war once, I put a
Spitfire into a flat-out dive.

325
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:57,825
No particular reason,
just youthful high spirits.

326
00:35:57,868 --> 00:35:59,779
I think now that I hit the sound barrier.

327
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:07,143
I remember that the more I pulled on
the stick, the harder the nose went down.

328
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:10,339
- The same thing happened today.
- You're not meant to do a high Mach number!

329
00:36:10,388 --> 00:36:12,949
I know, but I did.

330
00:36:12,988 --> 00:36:19,665
Both times, I felt that if I'd had the guts to
put the stick forward instead of pulling it back,

331
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:23,302
I could have pulled out
without having to lose speed.

332
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,145
What do you think?

333
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:30,341
There's nothing in the books to suggest for
one second anything so Edgar Allan Poe-ish.

334
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:32,982
Rather depends on the
books, doesn't it, Will?

335
00:36:34,388 --> 00:36:36,696
There were books once that
said the Earth was flat.

336
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:45,461
Yes?

337
00:36:45,508 --> 00:36:47,464
Oh. He's here.

338
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:51,466
It's JR, for you.

339
00:36:52,868 --> 00:36:54,746
Hello?

340
00:36:57,388 --> 00:36:59,344
Peel here, JR.

341
00:36:59,388 --> 00:37:01,185
Yes?

342
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:02,627
What, now?

343
00:37:02,668 --> 00:37:05,057
Well, yes, of course.

344
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:07,497
What have I done? He sounded grim as blazes.

345
00:37:17,108 --> 00:37:19,065
Here's Daddy.

346
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:22,304
- I'm sorry I'm late, darling.
- We had to start, darling.

347
00:37:22,347 --> 00:37:23,381
I had to see the old man.

348
00:37:23,427 --> 00:37:25,383
- You've got it, then?
- I've got what?

349
00:37:25,428 --> 00:37:30,057
- Well, the rise, of course.
- Oh, blast it. I forgot to ask him.

350
00:37:30,108 --> 00:37:32,827
- You forgot to ask him?
- Yes. I'm sorry darling.

351
00:37:32,868 --> 00:37:35,303
Oh, really! What a husband.

352
00:37:35,348 --> 00:37:40,342
All right. Bobby, go
out and play on the lawn.

353
00:37:40,388 --> 00:37:43,903
- That's it, you come with me. Nice flight, dear?
- Yes, thanks. Wonderful.

354
00:37:43,948 --> 00:37:47,544
I've got something hot for you in the oven.

355
00:37:50,387 --> 00:37:52,219
What does he want?

356
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:55,661
- You won't tell Jess, will you?
- No.

357
00:37:55,707 --> 00:38:00,736
To take the Prometheus up and reproduce
the conditions under which Tony crashed.

358
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:06,059
Could I have the bread, please?

359
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:10,867
Thanks.

360
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:15,187
- At the same speed?
- Well, faster, if possible.

361
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,296
When?

362
00:38:18,348 --> 00:38:20,703
I shall take her up this
afternoon for a high Mach number,

363
00:38:20,747 --> 00:38:22,942
and if that's all right, full crack tomorrow.

364
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:26,303
Are you going to do it?

365
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:30,546
Look, I don't have to, you know. This
was merely a suggestion, not an order.

366
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:34,457
Hm.

367
00:38:34,509 --> 00:38:37,898
That's the situation, Sue.
I don't have to, but I must.

368
00:38:38,908 --> 00:38:42,104
- Why must you?
- Well...

369
00:38:42,147 --> 00:38:46,903
It's a bit hard to explain. I only know that
if I don't accept your father's suggestion,

370
00:38:46,948 --> 00:38:49,382
I should never want to fly again.

371
00:38:49,429 --> 00:38:53,706
And as flying, I've now found
out, is my life, well, I...

372
00:38:55,788 --> 00:38:59,224
- There we are, darling. I hope it's still all right.
- It looks lovely.

373
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:05,263
- Fancy you forgetting to ask for the rise.
- Don't worry. I don't think he'll... object now.

374
00:39:05,308 --> 00:39:07,538
- Is it safe to buy the coats for the children?
- Mm.

375
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:11,628
Oh, good. Now they'll look smarter
than those stuck-up Harrison kids.

376
00:39:16,428 --> 00:39:19,465
A complaint from one of our most
important customers in Mexico

377
00:39:19,508 --> 00:39:24,458
has revealed to me a possible defect in
the Marlborough Mark 3 engine mounting...

378
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:26,498
Ah. Oh, Will.

379
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:30,703
What's the test scheduled
for the Prometheus tomorrow?

380
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:34,900
- The details are on the sheet.
- There's one quite important detail that isn't.

381
00:39:34,948 --> 00:39:39,146
- At what Mach number is my machine to fly?
- Mach One.

382
00:39:39,187 --> 00:39:41,179
Wasn't Tony enough for you?

383
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,308
We learnt a lot from Tony's crash.

384
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:48,306
Just enough to know that to fly
at the speed of sound is death.

385
00:39:54,028 --> 00:39:56,144
- Haven't you had enough of that?
- No.

386
00:39:58,266 --> 00:40:00,906
Ever heard of pilotless aircraft?

387
00:40:00,948 --> 00:40:04,020
This problem can't be solved
with pilotless aircraft.

388
00:40:04,067 --> 00:40:06,104
Not in years, anyway.

389
00:40:06,148 --> 00:40:08,820
Well, what are a few
years one way or another?

390
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:10,903
Important to me. I may
not have so many of them.

391
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:14,145
Hm. Trying for a peerage now, huh?

392
00:40:15,508 --> 00:40:17,021
You'd better get out, Will.

393
00:40:17,068 --> 00:40:22,745
I'm sorry for you, JR. I don't know
what devil it is that's eating you up.

394
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:25,178
And it can't make life any too happy for you.

395
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:32,698
Cable to Mexico City. Your letter received,
and will receive our attention. Stop.

396
00:41:04,188 --> 00:41:07,339
Oh. Good evening, Sue.

397
00:41:08,386 --> 00:41:09,456
Good evening, Father.

398
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:13,580
Well, you don't often give me the
pleasure of seeing you these days.

399
00:41:13,628 --> 00:41:16,903
- How's my grandson?
- He's very well.

400
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:18,462
Good.

401
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:21,618
- Father?
- Yes?

402
00:41:21,668 --> 00:41:26,537
- Are you going on with this test tomorrow?
- What's that to do with you?

403
00:41:26,588 --> 00:41:28,976
Did Philip tell you what
happened to him this afternoon?

404
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,258
Yes. I've just been reading his report.

405
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:36,345
For a good ten seconds, he
was completely out of control.

406
00:41:36,389 --> 00:41:38,220
What are his chances if
that happens tomorrow?

407
00:41:38,268 --> 00:41:40,338
Well, it might not happen tomorrow.

408
00:41:41,347 --> 00:41:42,941
Please put off the test, Father.

409
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:44,977
No.

410
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,658
You're prepared to let
Philip go the way of Tony?

411
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:51,619
Well, we don't know the way of Tony.

412
00:41:51,668 --> 00:41:54,899
That's Philip's job tomorrow,
to find out how Tony was killed.

413
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:57,985
And Tony was finding out how
Geoffrey de Havilland was killed,

414
00:41:58,027 --> 00:42:00,701
and another pilot will find
out how Philip was killed.

415
00:42:00,747 --> 00:42:02,386
And each time, we'll learn a bit more.

416
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:07,377
So that one day, Ridgefields will build an
airliner that'll go to New York in three hours.

417
00:42:07,428 --> 00:42:08,747
Two.

418
00:42:08,788 --> 00:42:11,939
So a few people who can afford it will
spend an occasional weekend in New York,

419
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,945
and Ridgefields shares will go up and up.

420
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:17,264
My dear Susan, what kind
of man do you think I am?

421
00:42:17,907 --> 00:42:21,218
I don't know. I... really don't know.

422
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:30,101
What sort of a man with... two deaths on his
conscience could risk burdening it with a third?

423
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:34,778
A man whose passionate worship is for a
pile of bricks and mortar called Ridgefields?

424
00:42:34,828 --> 00:42:39,743
My dear Susan, if you were to tell
me that only by giving up Ridgefields

425
00:42:39,788 --> 00:42:42,825
could I find out what happens to
an aircraft at the speed of sound,

426
00:42:42,866 --> 00:42:45,223
I'd say, "All right, Susan,
my girl, it's a deal. "

427
00:42:45,268 --> 00:42:48,977
- I don't believe that.
- That's because you can't understand it!

428
00:42:49,028 --> 00:42:53,068
You make imaginary sacrifices for yourself, but
it's other people's lives you really sacrifice.

429
00:42:53,108 --> 00:42:55,099
You think I felt nothing at Tony's death?

430
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:59,619
What else can I think, when a few hours after
his death I find you listening to his voice?

431
00:42:59,668 --> 00:43:06,744
Our ways are different in so many things, I
expect our ways of grieving are different too.

432
00:43:06,788 --> 00:43:10,541
Well, I don't suppose
you've any more to say to me.

433
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:11,987
Yes, I have, Father.

434
00:43:12,789 --> 00:43:16,667
- I'm taking John to live in London.
- Oh. Indeed?

435
00:43:17,548 --> 00:43:21,586
You know why I'm taking your
grandson away from you, don't you?

436
00:43:21,628 --> 00:43:24,619
You want me to think of
you as a man with a vision.

437
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:27,704
Well, that vision has killed
both my husband and my brother.

438
00:43:27,746 --> 00:43:31,297
And while I'm alive, it's
not going to kill my son too.

439
00:43:31,348 --> 00:43:35,341
There are evil visions as well
as good ones, you know, Father.

440
00:43:35,387 --> 00:43:37,457
That's why I'm taking my baby away.

441
00:44:04,028 --> 00:44:05,142
Thanks, Windy.

442
00:44:05,188 --> 00:44:08,068
- Tell them I'll be out in two minutes, will you?
- OK.

443
00:44:30,948 --> 00:44:32,825
You sent for me, Father.

444
00:44:32,868 --> 00:44:37,463
Well, thank you for coming.
I've... I've got something to say.

445
00:45:00,188 --> 00:45:02,303
<i>1-4 to Tower. Climbing now.</i>

446
00:45:02,347 --> 00:45:04,736
<i>JPTseems a bit high, but
other pressures normal.</i>

447
00:45:04,788 --> 00:45:06,858
<i>Checking. Will call again later.</i>

448
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:16,062
Erm, before you go off, I... I wanted to
know what school you've got John down for.

449
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,627
Is that all you wanted to say?

450
00:45:18,668 --> 00:45:23,503
No. Good schools are not two
a penny. You've got to think.

451
00:45:24,948 --> 00:45:26,700
But surely there's plenty of time.

452
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,865
<i>I'm climbing to 40,000 feet.
Weather conditions ideal.</i>

453
00:45:36,508 --> 00:45:40,467
<i>I'm going to make my first
run level at full throttle.</i>

454
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:41,827
<i>I'm still climbing.</i>

455
00:45:41,867 --> 00:45:44,381
- Susan...
- Yes, Father?

456
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:47,385
<i>Levelling out now. 40,000.</i>

457
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:50,386
<i>All right. I'm all set.</i>

458
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:52,418
<i>Starting run now.</i>

459
00:45:54,548 --> 00:45:55,822
<i>Increasing speed.</i>

460
00:45:57,668 --> 00:45:59,660
<i>Revs twelve-five.</i>

461
00:46:00,748 --> 00:46:02,465
<i>Mach 0.88.</i>

462
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,180
<i>0.89. Slight buffeting.</i>

463
00:46:08,068 --> 00:46:11,901
<i>0.90. Getting nose-heavy now. Correcting.</i>

464
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,864
<i>Throttling back.</i>

465
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:30,299
<i>Run completed.</i>

466
00:46:33,108 --> 00:46:36,101
- I'm sorry, I must go.
- No, don't go! Stay and talk.

467
00:46:36,147 --> 00:46:37,502
Don't leave me alone.

468
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:43,223
<i>1-4 to Tower.</i>

469
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,576
<i>Still at 40,000. At that speed,
she was quite controllable.</i>

470
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:49,303
<i>There was a slight port wing
drop, but nothing serious.</i>

471
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:52,420
<i>Didn't have to use trim,
I corrected on the stick.</i>

472
00:46:52,469 --> 00:46:54,265
<i>JPTnow normal.</i>

473
00:46:58,387 --> 00:47:02,427
Well, what were we talking about? It, erm...

474
00:47:02,468 --> 00:47:05,301
- It was about schools, wasn't it?
- Yes.

475
00:47:05,347 --> 00:47:06,781
<i>Right. Second run.</i>

476
00:47:08,148 --> 00:47:10,138
<i>This time we'll try a dive.</i>

477
00:47:10,189 --> 00:47:12,384
<i>35 degrees.</i>

478
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,943
<i>Here we go again. Starting dive... now.</i>

479
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:19,305
<i>Maximum revs.</i>

480
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:21,905
<i>0.91.</i>

481
00:47:21,949 --> 00:47:23,939
<i>Slight buffeting.</i>

482
00:47:23,988 --> 00:47:26,104
<i>0.92.</i>

483
00:47:26,149 --> 00:47:28,707
<i>She's pitching a bit. Still buffeting.</i>

484
00:47:28,748 --> 00:47:32,865
<i>0.93. Nose very heavy now.</i>

485
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:35,137
<i>Trimming back.</i>

486
00:47:35,188 --> 00:47:36,986
<i>Port wing dropping. Correcting.</i>

487
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:40,821
<i>0.94. Still under control.</i>

488
00:47:42,028 --> 00:47:43,905
<i>Nine-five.</i>

489
00:47:43,948 --> 00:47:45,940
<i>Nose still going down.</i>

490
00:47:47,428 --> 00:47:49,145
<i>Air brakes open, throttling back.</i>

491
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,389
<i>Second run completed.</i>

492
00:47:54,428 --> 00:47:58,103
Can a vision be evil, Sue? Can it? Can it?

493
00:47:58,948 --> 00:48:00,175
I shouldn't have said that.

494
00:48:00,228 --> 00:48:03,903
It's a terrible thing to make a man
doubt everything he's ever lived for.

495
00:48:03,948 --> 00:48:06,587
If I've killed them both for nothing.

496
00:48:06,627 --> 00:48:09,095
Well, it can't be true, can it? Can it?

497
00:48:20,507 --> 00:48:23,386
Ridgefield Tower, this is 1-4. 40,000 again.

498
00:48:34,948 --> 00:48:39,658
All right. Third and last, steepest
possible, dive. Full throttle.

499
00:48:39,707 --> 00:48:41,026
Here we go.

500
00:48:52,748 --> 00:48:54,227
Nine-four.

501
00:48:56,068 --> 00:48:57,899
Nine-five.

502
00:48:57,948 --> 00:48:59,347
Buffeting.

503
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:01,576
Nine-six.

504
00:49:02,788 --> 00:49:04,221
Nine-seven.

505
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:07,504
Nine-eight.

506
00:49:07,548 --> 00:49:08,536
Out of control.

507
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:16,056
25,000 feet.

508
00:49:17,629 --> 00:49:19,505
Air brakes on, throttling back.

509
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,339
Pulling out of dive.

510
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:35,141
<i>Ridgefield Tower, this is 1-4.</i>

511
00:49:35,189 --> 00:49:39,865
<i>Nose heavy again. I couldn't trim out,
I had to use the air brakes to pull out.</i>

512
00:49:39,908 --> 00:49:42,900
All right. Clear to land now. Runway 3-0.

513
00:49:42,948 --> 00:49:47,419
<i>1-4, negative. I've got an idea I
want to try out. I'm going up again.</i>

514
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:20,983
<i>Ridgefield Tower, this is 1-4.</i>

515
00:50:22,148 --> 00:50:23,342
<i>40,000 feet.</i>

516
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:28,585
I think I can beat this nose-heavy
business by reversing the controls.

517
00:50:28,628 --> 00:50:30,619
Anyway, I'm going to try.

518
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:32,736
I won't be a moment.

519
00:50:49,428 --> 00:50:50,827
All right, here we go.

520
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:58,385
<i>Increasing speed.</i>

521
00:50:59,867 --> 00:51:01,267
<i>Nine-four.</i>

522
00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:05,221
<i>Nine-five.</i>

523
00:51:06,587 --> 00:51:08,498
Buffeting.

524
00:51:08,548 --> 00:51:10,459
Nine-six.

525
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,701
Nine-seven.

526
00:51:14,188 --> 00:51:15,382
Nine-eight.

527
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:18,101
She's out of control.

528
00:51:20,867 --> 00:51:22,461
Nine-nine!

529
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:29,617
Mach One!

530
00:51:34,669 --> 00:51:36,863
I'm putting the stick forward.

531
00:51:40,508 --> 00:51:42,624
She's coming up!

532
00:51:42,668 --> 00:51:45,180
Throttling back.

533
00:51:53,268 --> 00:51:55,418
<i>It's sticking.</i>

534
00:51:58,508 --> 00:52:00,578
I did it! I did it!

535
00:52:05,827 --> 00:52:07,465
1-4 to Tower.

536
00:52:08,467 --> 00:52:13,746
On fourth run, Mach meter showed 1...

537
00:52:13,787 --> 00:52:15,540
.. point 01.

538
00:52:15,589 --> 00:52:19,786
Corrected nose-heavy trim
by putting the stick forward.

539
00:52:21,228 --> 00:52:23,139
Have you got that? Stick forward.

540
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:25,867
I'm landing now.

541
00:52:32,948 --> 00:52:34,903
He's got through.

542
00:52:34,948 --> 00:52:36,939
It's all right. He's got through.

543
00:52:59,148 --> 00:53:01,298
You'll...

544
00:53:01,347 --> 00:53:02,827
You'll do me a favour, will you?

545
00:53:02,867 --> 00:53:04,426
Of course.

546
00:53:04,468 --> 00:53:09,906
You don't tell anyone what happened
in this office this afternoon.

547
00:53:11,308 --> 00:53:13,504
Do you think I would?

548
00:53:48,828 --> 00:53:51,546
I say. A chap called Sound just looked in.

549
00:53:51,588 --> 00:53:55,103
He's absolutely livid with you, old boy. He
says he's going to bump his speed up next time.

550
00:53:56,268 --> 00:53:57,542
Oh good, I've found you in.

551
00:53:57,587 --> 00:53:59,259
- Hello darling. I...
- Look at this.

552
00:53:59,308 --> 00:54:02,823
- We've got to make up our mind now.
- Look, darling...

553
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:08,100
Do you think the colour's too much? Cos they've
got a sort of beigey colour with stripes, and I...

554
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:09,705
Well, it seemed a bit dull to me, but...

555
00:54:09,748 --> 00:54:12,215
Look, darling, pay attention.
This is very important.

556
00:54:12,267 --> 00:54:15,464
- Is it all right?
- Yes, I'm sorry, darling. Yes, it's fine.

557
00:54:15,508 --> 00:54:18,386
Good, that's lovely. I'll
be able to get back in time.

558
00:54:18,427 --> 00:54:20,703
Well, bye-bye, darling. See you at home.

559
00:54:53,308 --> 00:54:55,344
Hm.

560
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:59,222
I thought I heard a car. I
wondered if it could be you.

561
00:55:02,948 --> 00:55:04,939
He has the look of Tony.

562
00:55:06,227 --> 00:55:07,786
His eyes.

563
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:12,580
- What's that?
- It's the moon.

564
00:55:12,629 --> 00:55:14,618
I never knew it could look so unfriendly.

565
00:55:14,669 --> 00:55:16,897
It's an unfriendly universe.

566
00:55:19,108 --> 00:55:20,665
Do you believe that?

567
00:55:20,708 --> 00:55:24,098
Unfriendly only because it's
unconscious of our existence. 12

568
00:55:24,148 --> 00:55:27,617
- That's a depressing conception.
- Doesn't depress me.

569
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:30,705
In our fight with the universe,
it gives us the advantage.

570
00:55:31,868 --> 00:55:33,587
Must it always be a fight?

571
00:55:34,548 --> 00:55:38,507
Well, I think it must. It wasn't for nothing
we were given so many weapons to fight with.

572
00:55:39,148 --> 00:55:43,027
- Such as?
- Imagination, for one thing.

573
00:55:43,068 --> 00:55:45,501
Which some people call vision, don't they?

574
00:55:46,506 --> 00:55:48,781
Yes, some people do.

575
00:55:48,827 --> 00:55:51,660
And I suppose another weapon is courage.

576
00:55:52,347 --> 00:55:55,420
- Daddy, why didn't you tell me?
- Tell you what?

577
00:55:55,468 --> 00:55:58,141
How alone you must have been.

578
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,702
Even Will had more imagination than...

579
00:56:02,508 --> 00:56:04,658
I am sorry.

580
00:56:04,707 --> 00:56:07,063
You've no need to be.

581
00:56:09,669 --> 00:56:11,579
- I must put John to bed.
- Yes.

582
00:56:11,629 --> 00:56:15,860
- He's no right to be up as late as this.
- And you mustn't keep your car waiting.

583
00:56:15,908 --> 00:56:18,216
The car's gone, Father.

584
00:56:18,267 --> 00:56:20,180
We've come home.

585
00:56:22,388 --> 00:56:23,786
Hm.
