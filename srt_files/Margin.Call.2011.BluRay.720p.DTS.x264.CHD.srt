1
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,260
Is that them?

2
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,032
Jesus Christ.

3
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,734
Are they going to
do it right here?

4
00:02:22,558 --> 00:02:24,575
You guys ever been
through this before?

5
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,912
No.

6
00:02:26,914 --> 00:02:30,565
It's best to ignore it, keep your
head down, and go back to work.

7
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:31,683
Go on.

8
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:40,008
Don't watch.

9
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,630
Timothy Singh?

10
00:03:01,698 --> 00:03:04,432
Yes.
I'm afraid we have to speak with you.

11
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:05,601
Come.

12
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,150
Eric Dale?

13
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:23,986
Excuse me?

14
00:03:24,053 --> 00:03:25,237
Eric Dale?

15
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,557
No.
Sorry?

16
00:03:28,624 --> 00:03:30,192
I'm not Eric Dale.

17
00:03:30,259 --> 00:03:32,093
I'm so sorry.

18
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,828
He's my boss.

19
00:03:34,113 --> 00:03:35,597
He's down the hall.

20
00:03:35,665 --> 00:03:36,998
Thanks.

21
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,182
Excuse me, Mr. Dale?

22
00:03:55,184 --> 00:03:56,484
This way.

23
00:04:05,327 --> 00:04:06,595
Okay.

24
00:04:46,269 --> 00:04:49,354
I am obviously sorry
that we are here today.

25
00:04:49,422 --> 00:04:54,559
But these are extraordinary times,
as you very well must know.

26
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,928
Look, I run
Risk Management.

27
00:04:56,996 --> 00:05:00,264
I don't really see how that's a
natural place to start cutting jobs.

28
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:02,801
We hope you understand
this is in no way personal.

29
00:05:02,868 --> 00:05:06,037
The majority of this floor
is being let go today.

30
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:12,210
Ms. Bratberg is now going to run through
the details of what the firm is offering.

31
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,731
Okay.

32
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:20,117
Mr. Dale, the firm is offering you a
six-month severance at half your salary.

33
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:23,772
You will keep all unvested
options that you currently hold.

34
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,857
Health will be extended
through that period.

35
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:32,247
You have until tomorrow at 4:47 to either
take the offer or it will be revoked.

36
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:33,615
Do you understand?

37
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,852
Yes.

38
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:38,370
Unfortunately, Mr. Dale,

39
00:05:38,437 --> 00:05:41,105
due to the highly sensitive
nature of your work here,

40
00:05:41,173 --> 00:05:44,643
the firm has to take certain
precautions for security purposes

41
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,312
that may seem punitive
in nature.

42
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:50,381
I hope, considering your

43
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,803
over 19 years of
service to the firm,

44
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:58,140
you will understand that these
measures are in no way a reflection

45
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,076
of the firm's feelings
towards your performance

46
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,011
or your character.

47
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:06,414
I don't understand.

48
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:10,484
She's apologizing for
what's about to happen.

49
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:14,505
Your company e-mail, access to the
server, access to the building,

50
00:06:14,573 --> 00:06:19,894
and your mobile data and phone service
will all be severed as of this meeting.

51
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,414
And this gentleman
will take you to your office

52
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:25,950
so you can clear out
your personal belongings.

53
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,942
What about what I'm currently working on?
I'm in the middle of something that...

54
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,796
The firm has worked out its transition
plan and is prepared to move forward.

55
00:06:38,864 --> 00:06:41,416
But we do appreciate
your concern.

56
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:46,287
We understand that this is difficult.
And here is my card.

57
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:47,906
Please contact me in
the next few weeks

58
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,358
if you need any assistance with
this transition in your life.

59
00:06:56,665 --> 00:06:57,732
Sir.

60
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,973
Okay.

61
00:07:07,493 --> 00:07:08,626
Okay.

62
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,629
Okay.

63
00:07:38,173 --> 00:07:39,407
Hey.

64
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:46,631
I'm sorry.

65
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,518
You still alive?
Uh-huh. For now.

66
00:07:51,287 --> 00:07:52,887
Congratulations.

67
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:55,974
It was a bloodbath.

68
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,275
I heard.

69
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,980
Listen, Eric,

70
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,349
if there was something I could
have done, I would have done it.

71
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,417
I know.
All right?

72
00:08:05,484 --> 00:08:08,019
Yeah, I know. I know.

73
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:09,971
Okay.

74
00:08:10,673 --> 00:08:11,940
Just tell me,

75
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,309
who was it?

76
00:08:14,376 --> 00:08:16,511
Come on, Eric.
Come on, Will.

77
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,379
Rogers?
I'm not going to say, you know.

78
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:19,815
You know me.
Robertson?

79
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:26,003
That cunt. I knew it.

80
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,555
I knew I shouldn't have fucking
gone to her last year.

81
00:08:27,623 --> 00:08:29,491
It wasn't anyone.
Eric, you know what it was?

82
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:30,826
It was bad luck, and
that's all it was.

83
00:08:30,893 --> 00:08:31,993
Yup.

84
00:08:32,662 --> 00:08:33,628
Yup.

85
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:37,449
All right, well, good luck.

86
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,749
Will?

87
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:40,801
Come here.

88
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:45,239
I was just in the middle
of a lot of shit right here

89
00:08:45,307 --> 00:08:47,259
that I think somebody
needs to take a look at.

90
00:08:48,026 --> 00:08:50,728
Eric, listen,

91
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:52,697
they're telling us everybody
needs to get out of here.

92
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:54,865
Just leave their stuff.

93
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:57,535
And while we appreciate
your concern,

94
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:01,973
this is not your
problem anymore.

95
00:09:06,845 --> 00:09:07,845
Good luck.

96
00:09:12,902 --> 00:09:14,269
Thank you.

97
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:23,945
Right this way, Mr. Murphy.

98
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:47,135
Eric, I'm very sorry.
Yeah.

99
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:50,038
Did they say what was
going to happen with us?

100
00:09:50,105 --> 00:09:52,139
Jesus, Seth.
What?

101
00:09:52,207 --> 00:09:54,709
It's going to get pretty ugly
around here for a while.

102
00:09:54,777 --> 00:09:58,513
But, you know, you guys
will be all right.

103
00:09:58,581 --> 00:10:00,715
Good luck, Eric.
All right.

104
00:10:03,419 --> 00:10:06,922
I'll see you around, okay?
All right. Thank you.

105
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:28,777
Eric.

106
00:10:31,664 --> 00:10:34,081
I wanted to say thanks.

107
00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:36,667
It's not necessary.
Well, it is.

108
00:10:36,735 --> 00:10:39,337
You were the person
around here that I...

109
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:40,505
I know.

110
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:45,743
Hey, look,

111
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,313
I was working on something, but
they wouldn't let me finish it.

112
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,965
So, take a look at it.

113
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,935
Be careful.

114
00:11:15,274 --> 00:11:17,008
<i>We're sorry.</i>

115
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:20,445
<i>The telephone you are calling from
is not in service at this time.</i>

116
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:28,553
Robertson!

117
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:30,471
Sarah Robertson.

118
00:11:30,539 --> 00:11:31,739
Sarah.

119
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,577
You shut off my phone?

120
00:11:35,644 --> 00:11:38,012
Eric, I didn't do anything.

121
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,380
Fuck you.

122
00:12:04,239 --> 00:12:07,258
Well, that was
fucking hideous.

123
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:10,027
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

124
00:12:10,095 --> 00:12:11,412
You think?

125
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:13,981
Much.

126
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,352
You got any Nicorettes?

127
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:21,789
I'm out of Nicorettes.

128
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:25,526
Which means in about 10 minutes
I'm going to kill someone.

129
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:31,866
You all right, Sam?

130
00:12:33,118 --> 00:12:34,752
My dog is dying.

131
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:40,975
I'm sorry.

132
00:12:41,042 --> 00:12:45,797
Just got off the phone with the vet.
Fucking tumor on her liver.

133
00:12:45,864 --> 00:12:50,335
I was spending, like, $1,000 a day
already just trying to keep her alive.

134
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,102
Yeah,

135
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,339
I don't have a fucking clue
what to do about it.

136
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,528
Well, they're
all gone.

137
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,931
So...

138
00:13:07,503 --> 00:13:09,270
How many do we have left?

139
00:13:09,338 --> 00:13:10,938
About 33.

140
00:13:11,006 --> 00:13:14,676
Well, make sure they're all out there.
I've gotta say something.

141
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:17,111
Yeah, no,
they're ready.

142
00:13:17,179 --> 00:13:19,030
They're ready
for you.

143
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,226
All right, let's hear it.

144
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:42,603
You're all still here
for a reason.

145
00:13:42,671 --> 00:13:47,124
80% of this floor was
just sent home, forever.

146
00:13:47,192 --> 00:13:49,593
We spent the last hour
saying our goodbyes.

147
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:52,629
They were good people and
they were good at their jobs,

148
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:54,882
but you were better.

149
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:58,086
Now they're gone, they're
not to be thought of again.

150
00:13:58,153 --> 00:14:00,688
This is your opportunity.

151
00:14:02,024 --> 00:14:03,541
On every floor
of this building

152
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,610
and in every office,
from Hong Kong to London,

153
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:07,245
the same thing is happening.

154
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:09,280
By the time we're done,

155
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:13,567
three of every seven guys who were
standing between you and your boss' job

156
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:15,603
are gone.

157
00:14:16,538 --> 00:14:19,340
That is your opportunity.

158
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:25,763
I've been with this
place for 34 years,

159
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,833
and I can tell you this is not the last
time that you're gonna go through this.

160
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,636
But you are all survivors.

161
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:37,342
And that is how this firm, over 107
years, has continued to grow stronger.

162
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:41,178
So keep your heads high.
Get back to work. Let's hear it.

163
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,583
Everyone's going out, man.
You should... Come on.

164
00:15:35,651 --> 00:15:37,719
No, man. I'm cool.
Thanks.

165
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:42,056
Okay. Well, if you change your
mind, just give me a call.

166
00:15:42,124 --> 00:15:44,359
I will.

167
00:15:44,426 --> 00:15:45,560
Come.

168
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,831
Where you guys going?
The Grand.

169
00:15:50,899 --> 00:15:53,200
I will call you
when I am done.

170
00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:55,152
All right.

171
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,722
Hey, be glad
you're still alive.

172
00:16:00,058 --> 00:16:01,192
I am.

173
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,038
Have a good night, man.
You, too.

174
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,224
Come on. Come on. Come on.

175
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:21,859
<i>We're sorry. You've
reached a number...</i>

176
00:19:21,926 --> 00:19:24,344
<i>Fuck me. Fuck!
...that has been disconnected.</i>

177
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,941
Hello?
Hey.

178
00:19:38,643 --> 00:19:40,978
<i>I can't hear you.
What?</i>

179
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,747
Can you go outside?
It's too loud.

180
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:46,299
Hold on a second. It's loud.
Just give me a second.

181
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,572
<i>All right, what's up?
Hey, where are you?</i>

182
00:19:51,639 --> 00:19:54,274
<i>Lugo.
Okay. Are you with Will?</i>

183
00:19:54,343 --> 00:19:56,410
<i>Yeah. Will Emerson?
Yeah.</i>

184
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:59,580
Yeah. I think he's
still here. Why?

185
00:19:59,648 --> 00:20:03,217
All right. I need you to get Will, and
I need you guys to come back up here.

186
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,052
<i>Where?
To the office.</i>

187
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:07,904
<i>What?
I'm serious.</i>

188
00:20:07,972 --> 00:20:11,342
Wait a sec... You want me to get
our boss' boss out of a club

189
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:14,028
and bring him back to the office
at 10:00 on a Thursday night?

190
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:16,480
Well, our boss got axed,
so technically he is our boss,

191
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:19,984
<i>and yes, that is what I want you to do.
Why?</i>

192
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,620
Look, man. Just trust me, okay?
I need you guys back here now.

193
00:20:22,687 --> 00:20:24,989
<i>All right. We'll
be there in 10.</i>

194
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,008
Fuck.

195
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:47,761
Have I ever told you
how much I love your bag?

196
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:49,397
No, really.

197
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:52,032
Do you have a little dress that matches it?
Yeah, I do.

198
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,636
Because you could bounce around
in it like a fucking girl.

199
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,271
Hey!

200
00:20:57,338 --> 00:21:00,040
Look who's burning
the candle at both ends.

201
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,442
Why didn't you come
out with us?

202
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:05,879
There's no more cuts planned.
You don't have to kiss my arse.

203
00:21:05,947 --> 00:21:08,048
I frankly don't even know
what it is you guys do.

204
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:10,217
Well, I'm really sorry I had
to bring you guys back here,

205
00:21:10,284 --> 00:21:12,186
but...
That's all right.

206
00:21:12,253 --> 00:21:14,688
What's going on?
Look at this.

207
00:21:14,756 --> 00:21:17,758
Eric gave me this file before he left.
Eric...

208
00:21:17,826 --> 00:21:20,227
Dale. And he told me that he
couldn't quite figure it out.

209
00:21:20,294 --> 00:21:22,196
And the last thing
he said to me

210
00:21:22,263 --> 00:21:25,716
before the elevator doors
closed was, "Be careful."

211
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,595
He said, "Be careful"?

212
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,243
Yeah. So, obviously,
I'm a little curious.

213
00:21:28,286 --> 00:21:29,970
I start to get into
it a little bit,

214
00:21:29,972 --> 00:21:31,839
and I realize that the only
thing that he's missing...

215
00:21:31,907 --> 00:21:36,143
This is not good, Will. All right.
Okay. So what is he doing here?

216
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,446
No, no. Go to model four.
It makes more sense.

217
00:21:38,513 --> 00:21:40,213
Okay. All right.

218
00:21:40,281 --> 00:21:42,249
What is this?

219
00:21:42,317 --> 00:21:45,653
This is basically everything that we
have in our books at any given time.

220
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,322
But, what Eric was trying to
do was to work these numbers

221
00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:51,792
for levels of volatility that fall
outside of the standard VAR model.

222
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,394
What are those levels?
It's fairly complicated.

223
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:56,063
Simplify.

224
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,633
The volatility levels are set using
historic patterns, basically,

225
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:02,086
and then stretching those patterns
out another 10, 15% roughly.

226
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:03,621
All right, so?

227
00:22:03,688 --> 00:22:06,991
So, we are starting to
test those historic patterns.

228
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,794
When?

229
00:22:09,861 --> 00:22:11,395
Today.
Tuesday.

230
00:22:11,397 --> 00:22:14,664
Monday. Last Friday
and Wednesday.

231
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,567
Two Fridays ago.

232
00:22:16,634 --> 00:22:18,385
All right. I get it.

233
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,805
Fuck me.

234
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,975
Once this thing gets going
in the wrong direction,

235
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:26,626
this is fucking huge.

236
00:22:26,628 --> 00:22:29,447
How huge?

237
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,715
Well, the losses are greater than
the current value of the company.

238
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:34,985
Projected losses.
The projected losses, Will.

239
00:22:35,053 --> 00:22:37,521
And this is just our floor? Yes.

240
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:41,525
Where the fuck
is Eric Dale?

241
00:22:41,592 --> 00:22:43,060
I don't know. I tried to
call him. His phone is off.

242
00:22:43,128 --> 00:22:44,411
What do you mean?

243
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,496
They turned everybody's phone
off that they axed today.

244
00:22:46,565 --> 00:22:48,565
Fucking ruthless.

245
00:22:48,633 --> 00:22:49,989
Did you try his personal cell?

246
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,093
Yeah, I called his cell phone.
It's not on.

247
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:54,571
Call his home.
At this hour?

248
00:22:54,639 --> 00:22:56,907
Yeah. Do we even
know if he's right?

249
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:59,960
Looks pretty fucking right to me.
It does.

250
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:05,032
Mrs. Dale, it's Will Emerson.

251
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:08,002
I'm fine, thank you.
May I speak with Eric?

252
00:23:10,488 --> 00:23:12,689
No, we've tried that.
His phone appears to be off.

253
00:23:12,757 --> 00:23:16,660
Listen, could you have him call
me the moment he comes in?

254
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:19,263
The moment he walks
through the door.

255
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,065
Thank you so much.

256
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:22,499
Goodbye.

257
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,934
Where the fuck is he?

258
00:23:24,002 --> 00:23:25,469
Doesn't he have, like, three kids?
So?

259
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:28,105
Fuck, I don't know,
would you go home?

260
00:23:29,808 --> 00:23:31,541
I know where he is.

261
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,278
I need you two to
go and get him.

262
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:36,230
There will be a car
waiting for you downstairs.

263
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:38,065
You need to go.
Right now?

264
00:23:38,132 --> 00:23:39,800
Yeah, right now.

265
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:41,168
What are you
going to do?

266
00:23:41,236 --> 00:23:43,120
I'm going to call Sam.

267
00:23:47,275 --> 00:23:48,642
Fuck me.

268
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,877
<i>Yes?
It's Will.</i>

269
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,480
It's 11:00 at night.

270
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:11,849
I know. I'm sorry.
I wouldn't have called.

271
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,918
What's the problem?

272
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,904
I think you need
to get back here.

273
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:18,706
What?

274
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,807
<i>Sam, listen...</i>

275
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,909
It's 11:00 at night.

276
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,997
I'm well aware of the fucking time, Sam.
I'm telling you, you need to see this.

277
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,499
<i>See what?</i>

278
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:29,533
It's...

279
00:24:30,234 --> 00:24:32,119
E-mail it to me.

280
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,238
I don't think that that
would be a good idea.

281
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:39,877
I'm on my way.

282
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,401
Look at these people.

283
00:24:49,354 --> 00:24:53,573
Wandering around with absolutely
no idea what's about to happen.

284
00:24:57,111 --> 00:24:58,995
Right?

285
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:02,833
Well, I try to not let work
get to me like that.

286
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:05,085
I've noticed that about you.

287
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,106
Come on. We're 23 years old.

288
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,992
I'm 28.
All right, 28.

289
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,527
Whatever, it's the same thing,

290
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:18,282
but I made nearly a quarter of
a million dollars last year.

291
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,318
Fuck. For what?

292
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:24,104
I push numbers around
on a computer screen.

293
00:25:24,172 --> 00:25:26,773
A bunch of glorified crack addicts are
willing to take that information,

294
00:25:26,841 --> 00:25:28,442
and they pretend
to understand it,

295
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:30,010
and they bet it against some other
jock halfway around the world

296
00:25:30,077 --> 00:25:32,162
who, you know, if he
wasn't doing this,

297
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,866
he'd be in an OTB somewhere, putting
it all on number seven, you know?

298
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,336
At the end of the day,
one guy wins, one guy loses.

299
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:44,341
You do know it's a little more
complicated than that, right?

300
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:45,392
Yeah.

301
00:25:52,233 --> 00:25:54,835
It's Will. He wants to know if
we found him. What do I say?

302
00:25:54,903 --> 00:25:57,487
Let's say that we
haven't found him yet.

303
00:25:58,239 --> 00:25:59,473
Okay.

304
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:24,064
Hey.
Hey.

305
00:26:24,132 --> 00:26:25,232
So?

306
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:27,567
Eric Dale.

307
00:26:27,635 --> 00:26:29,869
Oh, Jesus.

308
00:26:29,937 --> 00:26:32,506
Before he leaves the building, escorted
by fucking security, by the way...

309
00:26:32,574 --> 00:26:34,208
I had nothing to do with that.
I know.

310
00:26:34,275 --> 00:26:35,642
I'm sorry. Go on.

311
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:38,111
Before he leaves the building, he
hands this disk to Peter Sullivan.

312
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,580
Who's Peter Sullivan again?
Doesn't matter.

313
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:41,648
He's one of Eric's guys.
All right.

314
00:26:41,716 --> 00:26:46,013
But before the elevator doors are
closing, the last thing that he says is,

315
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,112
"Be careful."

316
00:26:48,322 --> 00:26:49,989
"Be careful"?

317
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,124
Yeah.

318
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,292
"Be careful"?
Yeah.

319
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,094
Why?
Take a look.

320
00:26:57,148 --> 00:26:59,216
Oh, Jesus. You know I can't
fucking read these things.

321
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,418
Just speak to me in English.

322
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,022
All right. Basically, this kid, Peter Sullivan,
he gets all inspired by your pep talk.

323
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:06,823
Nice job, by the way.

324
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,626
And he delves straight
in after work.

325
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,328
And I think he nailed it.

326
00:27:11,395 --> 00:27:12,896
Nailed it?

327
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,833
Yeah, I think he figured out
what Eric was missing.

328
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,367
And?

329
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:19,786
It's not good, Sam.

330
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:23,690
These here are the historical
volatility index limits

331
00:27:23,758 --> 00:27:27,261
which, of course, our entire trading
model relies on pretty fucking heavily.

332
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:31,548
Well, we're now so levered up that
once it gets outside of these limits,

333
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,502
it gets ugly in a hurry.

334
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,055
And how close to those
limits have we gotten?

335
00:27:38,122 --> 00:27:40,990
Sam, we're beyond close.

336
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:44,578
We broke through these limits five
or six days in the last two weeks.

337
00:27:44,646 --> 00:27:47,364
Now, somehow we've managed to stay
on the right side of it for now.

338
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,032
For now.

339
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,619
Well, look what happens when we
get on the wrong side of it.

340
00:27:58,459 --> 00:27:59,659
Wait a minute. What
am I looking at?

341
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:00,927
You're looking at
this figure here.

342
00:28:04,966 --> 00:28:06,533
Whoa. Is that...
Yeah.

343
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,170
And that would not be a bad day
for us, historically speaking.

344
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,889
Is that figure right?
I don't know. I can't be sure.

345
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:13,991
Where's Eric Dale?

346
00:28:14,058 --> 00:28:15,558
We shut his phone off.
Of course we did.

347
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:18,262
Yeah. So I called his wife,
who says he's not home.

348
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,997
Yeah, he's probably crying in
some fucking beer somewhere.

349
00:28:20,064 --> 00:28:21,765
Yeah, or worse.

350
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,033
Where's the kid
that did this?

351
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,518
I sent him out
looking for Eric.

352
00:28:24,585 --> 00:28:26,269
You think he knows
what he's doing?

353
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,588
I don't know.
What do I know?

354
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:30,607
Get him back here.
Get him back here.

355
00:28:42,804 --> 00:28:46,072
What do you think these
girls make in a night?

356
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,407
$1,500?

357
00:28:54,616 --> 00:28:56,249
Two grand?

358
00:28:57,752 --> 00:28:59,986
Two grand.

359
00:29:00,054 --> 00:29:04,123
Fuck. That's...
That's pretty great.

360
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,793
I mean, all considered.

361
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:12,899
Shit.

362
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:14,133
Will.

363
00:29:16,136 --> 00:29:18,037
Yep.

364
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,807
No. No, we asked,
and nobody's seen him.

365
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:25,445
Okay, yep.

366
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:43,680
All right, so what do you
think Rogers makes in a year?

367
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,982
I don't know, I have no idea.
Come on. Play along.

368
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:49,019
What year? I don't know.
Last year.

369
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,221
Three quarters
of a million.

370
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:54,991
Come on.

371
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,261
What?
Oh, it's not even close.

372
00:29:57,328 --> 00:29:59,163
More?
Much more.

373
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:01,665
A million?

374
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:04,234
Will Emerson made two and
a half million last year.

375
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,136
Fuck you.
Fuck me.

376
00:30:06,204 --> 00:30:08,505
Fuck you. How do
you know that?

377
00:30:09,707 --> 00:30:11,308
He told me.
He just told you?

378
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:14,378
I asked him, and
yeah, he told me.

379
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:16,813
You think that's true?

380
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,549
Yeah, probably.

381
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,484
That's fucked up.

382
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:24,821
Why is that fucked up?
I don't know, does it seem right to you?

383
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,524
Right? I mean,
right is... Right is...

384
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:30,927
Jesus.

385
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,797
So what do you think
that means Rogers puts away?

386
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:37,484
I have no idea, Seth.
This traffic is a fucking nightmare.

387
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,451
Sorry.

388
00:31:01,409 --> 00:31:02,308
Gentlemen.

389
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,345
Will. Mr. Rogers.

390
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:07,246
Come with us, please.

391
00:31:13,687 --> 00:31:15,822
Sam, this is Seth Bregman
and Peter Sullivan.

392
00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:16,990
Sir.

393
00:31:20,027 --> 00:31:21,594
Will?
Uh-huh?

394
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,297
Where are we going?

395
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:27,567
We're going to get a second
opinion on your work, Peter.

396
00:32:03,971 --> 00:32:06,172
So, Sam, what
do you have for us?

397
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,241
It'll be here in a minute.

398
00:32:08,308 --> 00:32:10,210
Finding somebody in the copy room at this
hour was a little bit of a challenge.

399
00:32:10,277 --> 00:32:11,962
Okay, let's go right into
the introductions.

400
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,446
This is Sarah Robertson,
who you know.

401
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:17,000
Chief Risk Management Officer
Ramesh Shah from upstairs.

402
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,719
And David Horn, one of the
firm's in-house counsel.

403
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:23,222
Nice to meet you all. This is my Head of
Trading, Will Emerson, and this is...

404
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,993
Peter Sullivan and Seth Bregman.
They work in our Risk Department.

405
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,694
Where's Eric Dale?

406
00:32:28,762 --> 00:32:30,764
He was let go today.

407
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,735
Who do you have left
in your Risk Department?

408
00:32:35,803 --> 00:32:39,789
As of today that would be Peter
and our Junior Analyst, Seth.

409
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,460
Really?

410
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:45,829
Will Emerson?

411
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,649
Yes, please. Just
hand them out.

412
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,750
Thank you.

413
00:33:01,362 --> 00:33:03,530
Apparently, Eric had been
working on this for some time,

414
00:33:03,598 --> 00:33:04,998
but he wasn't
able to finish it.

415
00:33:05,065 --> 00:33:06,766
This morning, as he
left the building,

416
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,536
he handed the program to Peter here
and asked him to take a look at it.

417
00:33:09,604 --> 00:33:13,406
Peter did. He put a few things in
that Eric seemed to be missing,

418
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,642
and this is what came out.

419
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:18,695
Peter, is this your work?

420
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,732
Mostly Mr. Dale's.

421
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,618
But is this your draft?

422
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:26,820
Yes.

423
00:33:26,887 --> 00:33:30,673
Again, expanded on the original
work by Mr. Dale. But, yes.

424
00:33:30,741 --> 00:33:32,008
What's your background?

425
00:33:32,076 --> 00:33:33,426
My background?
Your CV?

426
00:33:33,494 --> 00:33:34,761
I've been with the firm
for two and a half years,

427
00:33:34,828 --> 00:33:35,895
working with Eric
that whole time.

428
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:37,897
But I hold a doctorate
in engineering,

429
00:33:37,965 --> 00:33:40,967
specialty in propulsion, from MIT
with a bachelor's from Penn.

430
00:33:41,035 --> 00:33:43,636
What is a specialty
in propulsion, exactly?

431
00:33:43,704 --> 00:33:46,539
My thesis was a study in the
ways that friction ratios

432
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,476
affect steering outcomes in aeronautical
use under reduced gravity loads.

433
00:33:51,161 --> 00:33:53,446
So, you're
a rocket scientist?

434
00:33:53,514 --> 00:33:55,015
I was. Yeah.

435
00:33:56,083 --> 00:33:57,417
Interesting.

436
00:33:57,485 --> 00:33:59,136
How did you end up here?

437
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,738
It's all just numbers, really.
Just changing what you're adding up.

438
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:05,525
And to speak freely, the money here
is considerably more attractive.

439
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,052
What time is it?

440
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,587
2:15.

441
00:34:17,654 --> 00:34:21,124
Fuck me. Fuck me.

442
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:23,659
And I'm guessing by the fact that
you two haven't said anything

443
00:34:23,727 --> 00:34:25,395
that the math checks out.

444
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,765
Look, we'd need some
time to go over this.

445
00:34:28,832 --> 00:34:32,269
But Mr. Sullivan here seems
like he knows what he's doing.

446
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,237
So, it would appear
we have a problem.

447
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:35,655
Thank you for that.

448
00:34:35,723 --> 00:34:36,990
What time is it?

449
00:34:37,057 --> 00:34:38,841
2:16.
Fuck me.

450
00:34:40,361 --> 00:34:41,627
Fuck me.

451
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:53,022
Sam, how long under
normal operations

452
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:55,608
would it take your people
to clear that from our books?

453
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:00,463
What?

454
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,032
All of it?
Yes.

455
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:06,119
I don't know. Weeks.

456
00:35:06,187 --> 00:35:08,888
Weeks?
Yeah. Weeks.

457
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:13,826
But you certainly know that our
business is selling and buying?

458
00:35:13,894 --> 00:35:15,929
It doesn't work for very long
without both components.

459
00:35:15,997 --> 00:35:17,530
We suddenly stop
buying for a day or two,

460
00:35:17,598 --> 00:35:20,734
that's not something you can hide
under the rug. That gets out.

461
00:35:20,801 --> 00:35:25,105
And when it does, this whole thing
comes to an end, and right quick.

462
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,408
I understand.
Do you?

463
00:35:31,545 --> 00:35:32,579
Yes.

464
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:38,351
How many traders do we have left
between your floor and Peterson's?

465
00:35:38,418 --> 00:35:40,386
I don't know, what...
60.

466
00:35:40,454 --> 00:35:41,938
Jared, as I look
at this more closely,

467
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,374
it is these VAR numbers that
are setting this thing off.

468
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,759
Excuse me.

469
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,789
I warned you
about this last year.

470
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,958
We would not be in this position
if we had done what I...

471
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:03,994
Please.

472
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:05,611
As I was saying, and I
speak completely off the record,

473
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:07,847
it's only a matter of time
before someone else

474
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:10,750
starts putting these in and they come
up with exactly the same results

475
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:12,585
and look at exactly what
we're looking at right now,

476
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:13,653
if they haven't already.

477
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,371
Understood.

478
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:18,708
And, Sarah, what value would you
allow to be placed on those assets

479
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,144
that might remain on the
books, if they had to?

480
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:22,746
Why would they still
be on the books?

481
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:24,597
Because suddenly nobody
wants to fucking buy them.

482
00:36:24,665 --> 00:36:26,132
Fuck you, Sam. Will you give
me a fucking break here?

483
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,750
Excuse me, Jared...

484
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,385
Without an active market,
it would take weeks or months

485
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:31,537
for me to come up with
an accurate value on them.

486
00:36:31,605 --> 00:36:33,439
You would have to go
block by block.

487
00:36:33,507 --> 00:36:35,558
Look, Jared, it's a very simple
business, right? We talked about this.

488
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:36,810
Sam.

489
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:40,046
Will, Peter, and...

490
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,548
What the fuck is his name?
Seth.

491
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,968
Thank you. Seth. Could you
please give us a few moments?

492
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:48,654
And, Peter?

493
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,306
Has anyone else seen this?

494
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,025
No, no one
aside from us.

495
00:36:52,092 --> 00:36:54,194
And Eric Dale.
Yes.

496
00:36:54,196 --> 00:36:57,963
And can it really be possible that
we don't know where Eric Dale is?

497
00:36:58,031 --> 00:37:00,233
I called his wife, he
hasn't come home yet,

498
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,835
and we turned off
his phone today.

499
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:04,621
Perfect.

500
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,289
Well, I'd like to
know where he is.

501
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:19,735
Jesus fucking Christ.
Who is that guy?

502
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,171
Sam's boss.

503
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,474
He looks like he's
15 years old.

504
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,009
He's 40.

505
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:28,577
Yeah, how does
that happen?

506
00:37:28,645 --> 00:37:30,846
Oh, it happens
all the time.

507
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:35,385
Except to me.

508
00:37:37,554 --> 00:37:39,522
Kid's a fucking killer.

509
00:37:42,025 --> 00:37:44,694
What are they talking
about in there?

510
00:37:49,116 --> 00:37:50,783
It ain't pretty.

511
00:37:51,952 --> 00:37:53,619
What ain't pretty?

512
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:57,724
If people stop buying
what we're selling.

513
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:04,397
Jared.

514
00:38:04,464 --> 00:38:07,383
You cannot be doing what
you're thinking of doing.

515
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,018
Well, I don't see
any other choice.

516
00:38:09,085 --> 00:38:10,553
What does that mean,
we don't have a choice?

517
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,321
Fuck you, you don't
have a choice.

518
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:15,058
Fuck me? Did you even
look at the numbers, Sam?

519
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,659
Yeah, but what do I know?

520
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,111
Correct me if I'm
wrong, Mr. Shah,

521
00:38:18,178 --> 00:38:20,713
but these numbers,
they don't add up.

522
00:38:20,781 --> 00:38:22,215
One and one no
longer makes two.

523
00:38:22,282 --> 00:38:23,950
Look, if I may, I would like
a little bit more time.

524
00:38:24,018 --> 00:38:25,451
Jared, we can't
tell you yet.

525
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,870
Are you fucking kidding me?
We have talked about this.

526
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,089
We need a little more time
to give you our conclusion.

527
00:38:30,157 --> 00:38:33,259
Okay. We meet again
in 45 minutes.

528
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:35,978
Sam, do you have the file?
Yeah.

529
00:38:53,047 --> 00:38:55,081
What are you going to do?

530
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,736
Are you gonna call him?

531
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,042
I already have.

532
00:39:17,287 --> 00:39:18,287
Wow.

533
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:22,091
Jesus.

534
00:39:26,546 --> 00:39:28,348
Wow, that's gorgeous.

535
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,425
It's a long way down.

536
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,661
Yes, it is.

537
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:55,608
Will, don't do that.
Come on.

538
00:39:58,762 --> 00:40:00,529
You know the feeling
that people experience

539
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:04,600
when they stand on the edge like
this isn't a fear of falling.

540
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:07,836
It's the fear that
they might jump.

541
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:10,907
That's very deep and depressing.
Thank you.

542
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:13,176
Yeah, well, I'm a little
dark sometimes.

543
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:15,644
All right. Come down, please, Will.
Please, come on.

544
00:40:15,712 --> 00:40:17,246
Will.

545
00:40:17,314 --> 00:40:19,098
Yeah, fuck it.

546
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,233
Whoo!

547
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:23,202
Not today!

548
00:40:30,226 --> 00:40:32,812
It looks like they're going to
make us dump this shit.

549
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,963
What?

550
00:40:34,731 --> 00:40:36,198
You watch.

551
00:40:36,266 --> 00:40:37,950
How?

552
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:39,184
You'll see.

553
00:40:39,252 --> 00:40:40,686
How could they do that?

554
00:40:40,754 --> 00:40:43,823
They can't. It's impossible.
But they'll figure a way.

555
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,541
I've been at this
company for 10 years,

556
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:49,612
and I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

557
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:52,414
When all is said and done,
they do not lose money.

558
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,234
They don't mind if
everybody else does,

559
00:40:55,302 --> 00:40:57,136
but they don't lose.

560
00:41:05,512 --> 00:41:07,847
Will?

561
00:41:07,915 --> 00:41:11,050
Did you really make two and
a half million last year?

562
00:41:11,118 --> 00:41:12,485
Yeah, sure.

563
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:18,157
How did you
spend it all?

564
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,658
It goes quite quickly.

565
00:41:19,726 --> 00:41:21,560
You know, you learn to spend
what's in your pocket.

566
00:41:21,628 --> 00:41:23,312
Two and a half million
goes quickly?

567
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,314
All right, let's see.

568
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,449
So the taxman takes
half up front,

569
00:41:27,517 --> 00:41:29,718
so you're left with
one and a quarter.

570
00:41:29,786 --> 00:41:32,121
My mortgage takes
another 300 grand.

571
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:35,524
I send 150 home for my parents,
you know, keep them going.

572
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:36,792
So what's that?
800.

573
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,394
All right, 800.

574
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,480
Spent 150 on a car.

575
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:46,686
About 75 on restaurants.
Probably 50 on clothes.

576
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:49,755
I put 400 away for a rainy day.
That's smart.

577
00:41:49,823 --> 00:41:53,626
Yeah, as it turns out, 'cause it
looks like the storm's coming.

578
00:41:54,161 --> 00:41:55,894
You still got 125.

579
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:02,385
Yeah, well, I did spend $76,520
on hookers, booze, and dancers.

580
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:03,653
But mainly hookers.

581
00:42:05,455 --> 00:42:07,489
76,500?

582
00:42:07,557 --> 00:42:09,742
I was a little shocked
initially, but then I realized

583
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:13,345
that I could claim most of it
back as entertainment. It's true.

584
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:19,852
Holy shit!
Goddamn!

585
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,687
The cavalry is here!
Come on, we should go.

586
00:42:29,646 --> 00:42:31,280
How old are you?

587
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:34,584
Forty-three.
Jesus.

588
00:42:40,423 --> 00:42:42,091
This is bizarre.

589
00:42:44,527 --> 00:42:46,629
It's like a dream.

590
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:54,804
I don't know, seems like we
actually may have just woken up.

591
00:42:57,508 --> 00:42:58,641
Come in.

592
00:42:59,993 --> 00:43:02,194
How do we look?

593
00:43:02,262 --> 00:43:04,947
I should go.
No. You should stay.

594
00:43:05,015 --> 00:43:06,349
So?

595
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,567
It's legit.

596
00:43:08,635 --> 00:43:10,302
The kid killed it.

597
00:43:11,004 --> 00:43:13,272
The formula's worthless.

598
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:16,175
What does that mean?
It's broken.

599
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:19,312
There are eight trillion dollars
of paper around the world

600
00:43:19,379 --> 00:43:21,047
relying on that equation.

601
00:43:21,114 --> 00:43:22,315
Well, we were wrong.

602
00:43:22,383 --> 00:43:24,950
No, you mean
you were wrong.

603
00:43:25,018 --> 00:43:27,170
Now, don't get me started.
We discussed this.

604
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,104
I'm heading for
the conference room.

605
00:43:28,171 --> 00:43:29,872
No, I want you
to hear this.

606
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:33,576
I don't want
to hear this.

607
00:43:33,644 --> 00:43:35,878
How do you think I've stuck
around this place so long?

608
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:46,121
I called Tuld.

609
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,593
Do we have a contingency
plan here?

610
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,345
A contingency plan?
Yes.

611
00:43:53,413 --> 00:43:56,699
No, we went all
in on this one.

612
00:43:56,767 --> 00:44:00,336
So we've gotten ourselves quite
exposed here, haven't we?

613
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,556
To Tuld or the market?

614
00:44:06,493 --> 00:44:07,794
To both.

615
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,701
He's here?

616
00:44:32,769 --> 00:44:33,619
Mmm-hmm.

617
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,001
Tuld's helicopter just landed.
I know. Come with us.

618
00:45:06,069 --> 00:45:08,237
Where's Sam?
I don't know. You sure you want all of us?

619
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:09,422
Yes.

620
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:19,665
One piece of advice for
everyone before we go in there.

621
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:21,400
This could get a little ugly.

622
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,969
But whatever you do, just tell
the truth. No sugarcoating.

623
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:25,538
Do not change a word of it.

624
00:45:25,606 --> 00:45:29,325
No one here is smart enough,
including the rocket scientist.

625
00:45:36,232 --> 00:45:38,467
Mr. Cohen.
Morning.

626
00:45:40,253 --> 00:45:41,887
This way, please.

627
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:49,077
He's already in there
waiting for you.

628
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:50,646
Excellent.

629
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,337
John.

630
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,207
Please, sit down.

631
00:46:20,977 --> 00:46:22,845
Welcome, everyone.

632
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:25,565
I must apologize for dragging you
all here at such an uncommon hour.

633
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:29,869
But from what I've been told, this
matter needs to be dealt with urgently.

634
00:46:29,936 --> 00:46:33,022
So urgently, in fact, it probably
should have been addressed weeks ago.

635
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,358
But that is spilt milk
under the bridge.

636
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:40,463
So, why doesn't somebody tell me
what they think is going on here?

637
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:43,282
Mr. Tuld, as
I mentioned earlier,

638
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:46,169
if you compare the figure
at the top of page 13...

639
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:49,771
Jared, it's a little early for all that.
Just speak to me in plain English.

640
00:46:51,057 --> 00:46:52,457
Okay.

641
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:54,309
In fact, I'd like to speak to
the guy who put this together.

642
00:46:54,377 --> 00:46:57,013
Mr. Sullivan, is it?
Does he speak English?

643
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:58,163
Sir?

644
00:46:58,231 --> 00:47:00,016
I'd like to speak
with the analyst

645
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,450
who seems to have
stumbled across this mess.

646
00:47:01,518 --> 00:47:04,687
Certainly. That would be
Peter Sullivan. Right here.

647
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,089
Oh, Mr. Sullivan, you're here.
Good morning.

648
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:09,842
Maybe you could tell me what
you think is going on here.

649
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,929
And please, speak as you
might to a young child

650
00:47:13,996 --> 00:47:16,465
or a golden retriever.

651
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:20,269
It wasn't brains that got me here.
I can assure you of that.

652
00:47:22,004 --> 00:47:23,004
Well, um...

653
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:27,576
Sir, as you may
or may not know, I work

654
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:31,213
here for Mr. Rogers as an
associate in the Risk Assessment

655
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,148
and Management Office at MBS.

656
00:47:33,216 --> 00:47:36,935
Please. Just relax. Stand up.
Tell us in a clear voice.

657
00:47:37,003 --> 00:47:39,555
What is the nature
of the problem?

658
00:47:41,524 --> 00:47:42,624
Okay.

659
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,763
As you probably know,
over the last 36 to 40 months

660
00:47:47,848 --> 00:47:51,050
the firm has begun packaging

661
00:47:51,117 --> 00:47:56,254
new MBS products that combine
several different tranches

662
00:47:56,322 --> 00:48:00,459
of rating classifications
in one tradable security.

663
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:02,628
This has been
enormously profitable,

664
00:48:02,696 --> 00:48:04,963
as I imagine you noticed.

665
00:48:05,031 --> 00:48:06,365
I have.

666
00:48:06,433 --> 00:48:08,668
The firm is currently doing
a considerable amount

667
00:48:08,735 --> 00:48:10,269
of this business every day.

668
00:48:10,336 --> 00:48:13,739
Now, the problem, which is, I
guess, why we are here tonight,

669
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:17,426
is that is takes us,
the firm, about a month

670
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:21,713
to layer these products correctly,
thereby posing a challenge

671
00:48:21,781 --> 00:48:24,349
from a Risk Management
standpoint.

672
00:48:24,417 --> 00:48:26,636
And, Mr. Sullivan,
that challenge is?

673
00:48:26,638 --> 00:48:30,923
We have to hold these assets on our books
longer than we might ideally like to.

674
00:48:30,925 --> 00:48:32,808
Yes.

675
00:48:32,875 --> 00:48:35,110
But the key factor here is these
are essentially just mortgages.

676
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:38,864
So that has allowed us to push
the leverage considerably beyond

677
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:42,735
what you might be willing or allowed
to do in any other circumstance,

678
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:46,638
thereby pushing the risk profile
without raising any red flags.

679
00:48:48,375 --> 00:48:50,175
Now... Thank you,
Mr. Sullivan. Sit down.

680
00:48:50,243 --> 00:48:52,662
What I'm guessing your
report here says,

681
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,164
and give me some rope here.

682
00:48:55,231 --> 00:48:59,268
What I'm guessing it says is that
considering the, shall we say,

683
00:48:59,336 --> 00:49:02,505
bumpy road we've been on
the last week or so,

684
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:07,443
that the figures your brilliant co-workers
up the line ahead of you have come

685
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,795
up with don't make
much sense anymore

686
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,364
considering what's
taking place today.

687
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:14,132
Actually, not what's
taking place today,

688
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:17,036
but what's already taken place
over the last two weeks.

689
00:49:17,103 --> 00:49:20,505
So, you're saying
this has already happened?

690
00:49:20,574 --> 00:49:21,941
Sort of.

691
00:49:23,426 --> 00:49:25,794
Sort of.

692
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:31,650
And, Mr. Sullivan, what does your model
say that, that means for us here.

693
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,453
Well, that's where it
becomes a projection.

694
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:35,788
But...

695
00:49:38,157 --> 00:49:41,159
You're speaking with
me, Mr. Sullivan.

696
00:49:41,227 --> 00:49:43,261
Well, sir,

697
00:49:43,329 --> 00:49:47,149
if those assets
decrease by just 25%

698
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:49,718
and remain on our books,

699
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:54,023
that loss would be greater than
the current market capitalization

700
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,991
of this entire company.

701
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:02,597
So, what you're telling me

702
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:07,252
is that the music
is about to stop

703
00:50:08,554 --> 00:50:11,724
and we're going to be left
holding the biggest bag

704
00:50:11,791 --> 00:50:13,325
of odorous excrement

705
00:50:13,392 --> 00:50:16,178
ever assembled
in the history of

706
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,431
capitalism.

707
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:28,207
Sir, I'm not sure that I would put it
that way. But let me clarify.

708
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,442
Using your analogy,

709
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,612
what this model shows

710
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,248
is the music, so to
speak, just slowing.

711
00:50:37,651 --> 00:50:39,952
If the music were to
stop, as you put it,

712
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:43,321
then this model wouldn't be
even close to that scenario.

713
00:50:43,389 --> 00:50:46,091
It would be
considerably worse.

714
00:50:50,129 --> 00:50:53,832
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Sullivan.

715
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:58,504
Do you care to know why I'm
in this chair with you all?

716
00:50:58,572 --> 00:51:00,972
I mean, why I earn
the big bucks?

717
00:51:02,275 --> 00:51:03,475
Yes.

718
00:51:03,543 --> 00:51:07,145
I'm here for one reason
and one reason alone.

719
00:51:07,213 --> 00:51:13,302
I'm here to guess what the music might
do a week, a month, a year from now.

720
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:15,971
That's it.

721
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,207
Nothing more.

722
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:23,295
And standing here tonight,

723
00:51:23,363 --> 00:51:28,967
I'm afraid that
I don't hear a thing.

724
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:32,904
Just

725
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:36,908
silence.

726
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:56,845
So, now that we know the music has
stopped, what can we do about it?

727
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:01,232
Mr. Cohen? Ms. Robertson?

728
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:05,403
I'm afraid I think this is where
you're supposed to step back in.

729
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:08,957
Lord knows we've relied enough
on Mr. Sullivan tonight.

730
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,928
What do you have for us?

731
00:52:20,654 --> 00:52:25,657
What have I told you since the first
day you stepped into my office?

732
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,660
There are three ways to make
a living in this business,

733
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,097
be first, be smarter,
or cheat.

734
00:52:33,032 --> 00:52:35,234
Now, I don't cheat.

735
00:52:35,301 --> 00:52:40,272
And although I like to think we have some
pretty smart people in this building,

736
00:52:40,339 --> 00:52:43,875
it sure is a hell of a lot
easier to just be first.

737
00:52:44,677 --> 00:52:46,612
Sell it all. Today.

738
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,800
Is that even possible, Sam?

739
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:53,769
Yes, but at what cost?

740
00:52:55,571 --> 00:52:57,206
I'll have to pay.

741
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:00,409
Really?

742
00:53:00,476 --> 00:53:01,977
I think so.

743
00:53:03,062 --> 00:53:05,697
Where is this going
to come back to us?

744
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,133
Everywhere.

745
00:53:08,201 --> 00:53:12,771
Sam, I don't think you to understand
what your boy here has just said.

746
00:53:16,543 --> 00:53:18,176
If I made you,

747
00:53:18,978 --> 00:53:20,846
how would you do this?

748
00:53:26,552 --> 00:53:29,755
You call the traders in for their normal
6:30 meeting and you be honest with them.

749
00:53:29,822 --> 00:53:32,574
Because they're going to know
it's the end either way.

750
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:35,744
You're going to have to throw them
a bone, and a pretty big one.

751
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:38,063
And then you've got to come
out of the gates storming.

752
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,399
No swaps. No nothing.

753
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:42,768
40% done by 10:15. By 11:00,

754
00:53:42,836 --> 00:53:44,302
all your trades
have to be gone

755
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,722
because by lunchtime,
word's going to be out.

756
00:53:47,791 --> 00:53:51,860
And by 2:00 you're going to be selling at
65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky.

757
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:55,097
And then the feds are going to be in here,
up your ass, trying to slow you down.

758
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,181
Ramesh?

759
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:58,817
They can slow you down.
They can't stop you.

760
00:53:58,885 --> 00:54:00,152
It's yours to sell.

761
00:54:00,353 --> 00:54:03,288
But, John, even if

762
00:54:03,356 --> 00:54:06,792
we manage to pull that off,
and that's saying something,

763
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:11,680
the real question is,
who are we selling this to?

764
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:14,332
Same people we've been selling
it to the last two years,

765
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,034
and whoever else will buy it.

766
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:19,788
But, John, if you do this,

767
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,025
you will kill the market
for years. It's over.

768
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:28,364
And you're selling something
that you know has no value.

769
00:54:28,415 --> 00:54:32,868
We are selling to willing buyers
of the current fair market price.

770
00:54:33,602 --> 00:54:37,205
So that we may survive.

771
00:54:37,207 --> 00:54:40,926
You will never sell anything to
any of those people ever again.

772
00:54:40,993 --> 00:54:42,294
I understand.

773
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,196
Do you?
Do you?

774
00:54:45,481 --> 00:54:47,149
This is it!

775
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,384
I'm telling you.
This is it.

776
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:02,714
Now, it's 4:00.

777
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,850
Jared, you've got till 5:00 to break
this down and draw me up a plan.

778
00:55:05,919 --> 00:55:10,289
Is there anybody else who knows what's
in here at the moment, block by block?

779
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,841
Eric Dale.

780
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,343
And where is he?

781
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:17,496
As of today, he's no
longer with the firm.

782
00:55:17,563 --> 00:55:20,048
We have been trying
to locate him.

783
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,020
Carmelo.
Yes.

784
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:27,589
Get me Eric Dale here by 6:30.

785
00:55:27,641 --> 00:55:29,141
It's done.

786
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,276
We meet back here in an hour.

787
00:55:33,647 --> 00:55:35,413
Sam, let's talk.

788
00:55:48,628 --> 00:55:50,695
This is a hell
of a town.

789
00:55:52,532 --> 00:55:55,534
I've always loved this place,
since the day I arrived.

790
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,135
Everything about it.

791
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:08,864
Sam, are you going
to go with me on this?

792
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,351
I don't know, John.

793
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:16,021
This one is very ugly.

794
00:56:17,690 --> 00:56:20,492
You and I,
we're salesmen.

795
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:23,162
We sell. That's what we do.
It's not complicated.

796
00:56:23,229 --> 00:56:25,280
Exactly.

797
00:56:25,347 --> 00:56:27,950
And you know damn well you
don't sell anything to anybody

798
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,952
unless you think they're
gonna come back for more.

799
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:33,739
That's the lesson we learned.
And tomorrow, we're done.

800
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:35,173
But this is it, Sam.

801
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:37,442
You keep saying that.
What's that supposed to mean?

802
00:56:37,510 --> 00:56:39,911
This is the big one.

803
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:42,781
Most of us aren't going to
make it out of this one.

804
00:56:42,848 --> 00:56:44,849
Us?
The Street.

805
00:56:45,818 --> 00:56:47,936
What are you talking about?

806
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,405
This isn't the last situation I'm
gonna have to deal with this week.

807
00:56:50,472 --> 00:56:52,173
This is just the start.

808
00:56:52,241 --> 00:56:54,309
It's the start 'cause
you're starting it.

809
00:56:54,376 --> 00:56:58,130
Maybe. But I don't believe that.
Not this time.

810
00:56:58,197 --> 00:57:00,399
The numbers, they just
don't add up anymore.

811
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:04,035
I agree with you there.
I've been saying that for years.

812
00:57:04,103 --> 00:57:08,407
If this kid out there can
come up with this, then...

813
00:57:08,474 --> 00:57:11,210
Look, I just don't think I can
walk in there knowing what I know

814
00:57:11,277 --> 00:57:13,895
and put the hammer
down on these guys.

815
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,614
When did you start
getting so soft, Sam?

816
00:57:16,682 --> 00:57:19,418
Fuck you, soft.
You're panicking.

817
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:26,691
If you're the first out of the
door, that's not called panicking.

818
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:36,434
You're obviously operating with
more information than I have.

819
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:41,439
But I think this will
destroy this firm.

820
00:57:41,507 --> 00:57:43,075
No one will ever
trust you again.

821
00:57:43,142 --> 00:57:45,944
You're knowingly putting people
out of business, full stop.

822
00:57:48,614 --> 00:57:51,082
You let me deal
with that, Sam.

823
00:58:06,049 --> 00:58:07,081
How'd it go?

824
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:11,035
This is a fucking shit show.

825
00:58:11,103 --> 00:58:13,638
They're gonna go with it?
Probably.

826
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:15,707
Jesus.

827
00:58:17,443 --> 00:58:19,344
Remember this day, boys.

828
00:58:21,514 --> 00:58:23,214
Remember this day.

829
00:58:38,831 --> 00:58:41,032
So, what's the
strategy here?

830
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,367
That's where I'm
headed right now.

831
00:58:42,435 --> 00:58:44,269
Downstairs to work
on it with my guys.

832
00:58:44,337 --> 00:58:46,838
No, no. You and
I with John.

833
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:57,015
I'm not sure that we need one, Sarah.
That's not the way I do things.

834
00:58:57,082 --> 00:58:58,316
Please.

835
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:03,388
Listen, he knows where
we've stood on this

836
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,490
all along.

837
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:08,026
That's exactly
my point.

838
00:59:08,093 --> 00:59:12,230
And knowing what was
discussed by both you and I,

839
00:59:12,298 --> 00:59:15,367
I don't see how this could
provide you with anything

840
00:59:15,434 --> 00:59:18,170
other than a false
sense of comfort.

841
00:59:18,237 --> 00:59:21,506
I'm not looking for a sense
of comfort here, Sarah.

842
00:59:22,608 --> 00:59:25,243
I don't think there's
one to be found.

843
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:37,806
So, again, what's
the strategy here?

844
00:59:40,292 --> 00:59:42,761
I'm just not sure there's
much more to do on this.

845
00:59:43,829 --> 00:59:45,963
It's very simple.

846
00:59:46,031 --> 00:59:48,900
Don't even think about
fucking me on this.

847
00:59:49,968 --> 00:59:52,103
'Cause if we're
going down,

848
00:59:53,206 --> 00:59:55,607
then you damn well
know it'll be together.

849
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:58,893
No.

850
00:59:58,961 --> 01:00:00,862
I'm not sure that
I do know that.

851
01:00:22,968 --> 01:00:24,236
Hey.

852
01:00:24,736 --> 01:00:26,288
Oh, I'm sorry.

853
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:42,737
What do you guys think
Tuld made last year?

854
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,508
Would you shut
the fuck up?

855
01:00:46,576 --> 01:00:48,293
86 million.

856
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:52,163
In bonuses and salary.

857
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,132
Really?
Sure, it's public record.

858
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:56,501
That is a lot
of fucking money.

859
01:00:57,703 --> 01:00:59,437
He was worth a billion.

860
01:00:59,505 --> 01:01:00,638
Was?

861
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:03,125
Till today.

862
01:01:03,959 --> 01:01:05,260
Really?

863
01:01:06,862 --> 01:01:08,230
You'll see.

864
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,035
I'm going to get some coffee.
You guys want anything else?

865
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:16,905
I'm all right.
I could use some real air.

866
01:01:16,973 --> 01:01:18,990
Probably a good idea.
Is it all right, Will?

867
01:01:19,058 --> 01:01:20,925
Is what all right?
If I get out of here for a minute?

868
01:01:20,993 --> 01:01:22,760
Of course, it's not a prison.

869
01:01:22,828 --> 01:01:25,263
You want me to hold your hand?

870
01:01:29,702 --> 01:01:32,370
Why did they put
all this fruit on it?

871
01:01:41,747 --> 01:01:43,782
Hello, Will Emerson.

872
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:45,016
Hello.

873
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:49,854
Right.

874
01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:53,575
No, thank you.
I understand.

875
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:58,095
No, we'll be discreet.

876
01:01:59,632 --> 01:02:01,566
Thank you.

877
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,835
What?
Eric's wife.

878
01:02:03,902 --> 01:02:06,037
He's alive, he's home, he
doesn't want to speak to us,

879
01:02:06,104 --> 01:02:07,572
and he doesn't know
that she rang me.

880
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:09,590
Where's he live?
Heights.

881
01:02:09,759 --> 01:02:11,910
Shall I call Tuld's guy?
No.

882
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:14,245
It's Eric. The last thing we need
is those guys going over there.

883
01:02:14,313 --> 01:02:15,747
No, you two go get him
and try to bring him here.

884
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,333
But you got to be back by 6:00 a.m.
All right.

885
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,104
I hate Brooklyn.

886
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,460
May I come in?

887
01:02:29,462 --> 01:02:31,980
Of course.
Please, sit down.

888
01:02:37,453 --> 01:02:38,653
So...

889
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,859
We're going to
do this thing.

890
01:02:47,997 --> 01:02:49,163
Okay.

891
01:02:50,549 --> 01:02:52,450
It's going to be tight.

892
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:56,037
Is Sam on board?

893
01:02:56,104 --> 01:02:57,438
Not yet.

894
01:03:01,243 --> 01:03:03,111
Sarah,

895
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:07,415
I need a head to feed to the traders
on the floor and the board.

896
01:03:11,938 --> 01:03:13,905
Is it me or Cohen?

897
01:03:13,973 --> 01:03:15,306
It's you.

898
01:03:24,984 --> 01:03:28,887
Of course, you're well aware
that I filtered several warnings

899
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:31,957
to you and Cohen
about this a year ago.

900
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:36,511
I really don't think that's the best
path for you to take at this point.

901
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,451
You're going to be
well taken care of here.

902
01:03:46,188 --> 01:03:47,989
Obviously, it is

903
01:03:49,025 --> 01:03:50,158
quite complicated.

904
01:03:50,225 --> 01:03:52,410
John, I was told under
no uncertain terms...

905
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,696
It was always
a very gray area.

906
01:03:54,763 --> 01:03:59,601
Actually, it was made very clear
at the time by you, me, and Cohen.

907
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:05,173
I'd really appreciate it if
you didn't fight me on this.

908
01:04:17,302 --> 01:04:19,938
We all fucked this
one up pretty good.

909
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:21,940
Yes.

910
01:04:24,326 --> 01:04:26,361
We need you to stay here
until this is finished

911
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:28,696
and the market's closed.

912
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,231
I understand.

913
01:04:32,518 --> 01:04:36,087
They'll go over the numbers
with you downstairs.

914
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:37,489
Good luck.

915
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:57,141
Oh, fuck.
Jared's coming.

916
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,512
What's the boy
wonder want?

917
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:08,853
You got a minute?
Just off to pick up Eric.

918
01:05:08,921 --> 01:05:10,688
Yeah. I know. It will
only take a second.

919
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:12,289
All right,
what is it?

920
01:05:12,357 --> 01:05:14,792
Tuld and I have
concerns that Sam

921
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:18,195
may not be willing to step up
and do the right thing here.

922
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,681
This has never
been a problem.

923
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,048
No, it hasn't.

924
01:05:21,116 --> 01:05:24,302
But sometimes, in acute
situations such as this,

925
01:05:24,370 --> 01:05:29,774
often what is right can take
on multiple interpretations.

926
01:05:33,746 --> 01:05:35,296
Sam will step up.

927
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:38,099
Oh, I know he will.
But if he doesn't...

928
01:05:39,651 --> 01:05:42,970
But if he doesn't, we need
to know that you will.

929
01:05:45,006 --> 01:05:46,341
Thank you.

930
01:05:46,408 --> 01:05:48,459
You need to know
that I will what?

931
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:51,896
That you'll
step up.

932
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:54,833
I have no doubt that Sam will
make the right decision.

933
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:56,567
But just to
make it clear,

934
01:05:56,635 --> 01:05:59,570
he and I have always had the same
interpretation of what's right,

935
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,958
no matter how acute
the situation.

936
01:08:50,141 --> 01:08:51,776
Jesus, that's a nice place.

937
01:08:51,843 --> 01:08:54,144
Yeah, it is.
He just bought it.

938
01:08:55,747 --> 01:08:58,600
I hope it was with cash.

939
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:01,469
Fuck me, you're a heartless
little shit sometimes.

940
01:09:03,121 --> 01:09:04,622
And it wasn't.

941
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:08,876
Don't touch any
of the buttons.

942
01:09:15,283 --> 01:09:17,552
What are you doing here?
Hey.

943
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:27,562
So, Peter finished the model
you were working on.

944
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,763
Really?

945
01:09:29,831 --> 01:09:31,766
It caused a shit storm.

946
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,300
I bet it did.

947
01:09:34,402 --> 01:09:35,620
You think he's right?

948
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:38,155
I know he's right.

949
01:09:40,425 --> 01:09:41,493
Fuck.

950
01:09:43,545 --> 01:09:44,879
All right.

951
01:09:50,035 --> 01:09:52,370
So Jared Cohen called
an emergency meeting

952
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:54,422
with the senior
partners last night.

953
01:09:54,489 --> 01:09:56,741
And based on your findings,

954
01:09:56,809 --> 01:10:00,011
they've decided to liquidate
our entire position.

955
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,813
Today.

956
01:10:04,132 --> 01:10:06,166
I'm very sorry
about that.

957
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:15,943
They're worried about you being out here
and they want me to bring you back.

958
01:10:16,511 --> 01:10:18,212
Please.

959
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:20,013
I'm just saying.

960
01:10:20,081 --> 01:10:21,782
Fuck them. Fuck them.
Eric...

961
01:10:21,784 --> 01:10:24,385
Don't be rash.
Forget it. I signed my paper. I'm out.

962
01:10:24,453 --> 01:10:26,955
They'll pay you.
They got nothing on me.

963
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,122
They'll pay you.

964
01:10:28,991 --> 01:10:31,225
I've been paid
enough already.

965
01:10:35,297 --> 01:10:36,430
Fuck.

966
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:42,169
Do you know I built
a bridge once?

967
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,672
Sorry?
A bridge.

968
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:47,624
No, I didn't know that.

969
01:10:47,693 --> 01:10:49,927
I was an engineer
by trade.

970
01:10:52,130 --> 01:10:56,200
It went from Dilles Bottom, Ohio,
to Moundsville, West Virginia.

971
01:10:56,267 --> 01:10:59,003
It spanned 912 feet
above the Ohio River.

972
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:02,372
12,100 people
use this thing a day.

973
01:11:02,440 --> 01:11:05,793
And it cut out 35 miles
of extra driving each way

974
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:08,362
between Wheeling
and New Martinsville.

975
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:13,367
That's a combined 847,000
miles of driving a day.

976
01:11:14,870 --> 01:11:18,672
Or 25,410,000
miles a month.

977
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:27,698
And 304,920,000
miles a year saved.

978
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:31,902
Now, I completed that project in 1986.
That's 22 years ago.

979
01:11:33,004 --> 01:11:35,172
So over the life
of that one bridge,

980
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:41,345
that's 6,708,240,000
miles

981
01:11:41,412 --> 01:11:44,231
that haven't had
to be driven at...

982
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,701
What? Let's say
50 miles an hour.

983
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:48,869
So that's what?

984
01:11:48,937 --> 01:11:52,640
That's 134,164,800
hours.

985
01:11:52,708 --> 01:11:56,877
Or 559,020 days.

986
01:11:56,945 --> 01:11:59,112
So that one little bridge
has saved the people

987
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:00,481
of those two
communities a combined

988
01:12:00,549 --> 01:12:04,017
1,531 years
of their lives

989
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:07,321
not wasted in
a fucking car.

990
01:12:11,193 --> 01:12:14,428
1,531 years.

991
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:16,197
Jesus.

992
01:12:27,693 --> 01:12:30,394
I guess you better
get back over there.

993
01:12:34,399 --> 01:12:35,533
Yeah.

994
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:41,238
Thanks for coming by.

995
01:12:41,306 --> 01:12:42,874
You're welcome.

996
01:12:47,078 --> 01:12:48,546
Who the fuck is this?

997
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,115
I would imagine
it's the firm's people.

998
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:52,766
What?

999
01:12:52,834 --> 01:12:55,203
They don't want
any loose ends.

1000
01:12:56,738 --> 01:12:59,489
They fired me.
Fuck them. Fuck them.

1001
01:12:59,557 --> 01:13:02,926
I totally agree. Fuck them.
So come back, take the money,

1002
01:13:02,994 --> 01:13:04,662
you'll be home by 5:00.

1003
01:13:04,729 --> 01:13:06,397
Otherwise, they're going to
fight you on everything.

1004
01:13:06,465 --> 01:13:09,784
They're going to fight you on your
package, your options, everything.

1005
01:13:10,452 --> 01:13:11,719
Be smart.

1006
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:21,162
Well, you're a better
man than me.

1007
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:23,898
That's always been true.
Yes, it has.

1008
01:13:29,387 --> 01:13:30,938
House looks good.

1009
01:13:32,624 --> 01:13:33,824
Thanks.

1010
01:13:35,326 --> 01:13:37,495
Hey, Eric.

1011
01:13:37,563 --> 01:13:41,933
Don't beat yourself up too much
about this stuff, all right?

1012
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,235
Some people like driving
the long way home.

1013
01:13:45,303 --> 01:13:47,355
Who the fuck knows, right?

1014
01:14:17,936 --> 01:14:19,603
Ah.

1015
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:21,105
There he is.

1016
01:14:22,674 --> 01:14:23,574
John.

1017
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:27,511
How's it looking?

1018
01:14:27,579 --> 01:14:30,680
Cohen's doing a nice
job. It could work.

1019
01:14:30,748 --> 01:14:32,533
What does that mean?

1020
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:35,736
It means,

1021
01:14:35,804 --> 01:14:38,572
as you very well know,

1022
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,876
that you're a very important
piece of this puzzle.

1023
01:15:13,942 --> 01:15:16,109
That's very generous.

1024
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,678
It's not a gift.

1025
01:15:17,746 --> 01:15:20,480
I need to know you're
with me on this.

1026
01:15:23,785 --> 01:15:25,386
I'm with the firm, John.

1027
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:30,574
I won't get what I need
from your boys on the floor

1028
01:15:30,642 --> 01:15:31,843
unless they believe you.

1029
01:15:34,079 --> 01:15:36,814
Unless they believe
in you completely.

1030
01:15:41,103 --> 01:15:43,004
Are you in on this?

1031
01:15:44,572 --> 01:15:46,473
I've told you
my reservations.

1032
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,659
You can't have
reservations.

1033
01:15:49,778 --> 01:15:51,745
And I need
to know now.

1034
01:15:54,049 --> 01:15:57,885
Well, John, I am completely with
the firm, as I always have been.

1035
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,269
Excuse me.

1036
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,833
All right, Will,
am I getting fired?

1037
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:32,153
I don't know.

1038
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,490
Yeah.

1039
01:16:37,775 --> 01:16:39,693
Almost definitely. Yes.

1040
01:16:42,414 --> 01:16:43,898
Are you?
No.

1041
01:16:46,534 --> 01:16:48,002
Seth, it's nothing you did.

1042
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:50,404
You're just in the wrong
firm at the wrong time.

1043
01:16:50,406 --> 01:16:53,290
Young guys are always
the first to get culled.

1044
01:16:53,358 --> 01:16:55,609
Listen, nothing I'm gonna say is
going to make you feel any better.

1045
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:59,413
It's just going to suck for a
while, and then you'll be fine.

1046
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,152
You all right?

1047
01:17:06,905 --> 01:17:09,056
Yeah. I'm fine.

1048
01:17:09,123 --> 01:17:12,760
For what it's worth, I'm sorry
this is happening to you.

1049
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,664
Don't be. You didn't
do it to me.

1050
01:17:16,731 --> 01:17:20,083
Still, at least you're going to have
some nice cash to walk away with.

1051
01:17:20,168 --> 01:17:21,702
I guess.

1052
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,454
Shit, this is really going
to affect people.

1053
01:17:23,522 --> 01:17:25,022
Yeah, it's going to
affect people like me.

1054
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:27,942
No. No. Real people.

1055
01:17:28,627 --> 01:17:30,294
Jesus, Seth.

1056
01:17:30,362 --> 01:17:32,145
Listen, if you really want
to do this with your life,

1057
01:17:32,213 --> 01:17:34,732
you have to believe you're
necessary. And you are.

1058
01:17:34,799 --> 01:17:36,600
People want to live
like this, in their cars

1059
01:17:36,667 --> 01:17:39,286
and the big fucking houses
they can't even pay for,

1060
01:17:39,354 --> 01:17:41,038
then you're necessary.

1061
01:17:41,105 --> 01:17:43,373
The only reason that they all get
to continue living like kings

1062
01:17:43,441 --> 01:17:46,510
is because we've got our fingers
on the scales in their favor.

1063
01:17:46,577 --> 01:17:48,612
I take my hand off,

1064
01:17:48,847 --> 01:17:52,499
then the whole world gets really
fucking fair really fucking quickly,

1065
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:55,402
and nobody actually wants that.
They say they do, but they don't.

1066
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:57,654
They want what we
have to give them,

1067
01:17:57,722 --> 01:18:00,190
but they also want
to play innocent

1068
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,942
and pretend they have no
idea where it came from.

1069
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:03,911
That's more hypocrisy
than I'm willing to swallow.

1070
01:18:03,978 --> 01:18:07,281
So fuck...
Fuck normal people.

1071
01:18:07,348 --> 01:18:11,318
The funny thing is, tomorrow,
if all of this goes tits up

1072
01:18:11,386 --> 01:18:14,771
they're going to crucify
us for being too reckless.

1073
01:18:14,840 --> 01:18:16,673
But if we're wrong

1074
01:18:16,842 --> 01:18:19,443
and everything gets
back on track,

1075
01:18:19,510 --> 01:18:22,028
then the same people are going to
laugh till they piss their pants,

1076
01:18:22,096 --> 01:18:23,630
'cause we're gonna look
like the biggest pussies

1077
01:18:23,698 --> 01:18:25,933
God ever let
through the door.

1078
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:31,605
You think we're
going to be wrong?

1079
01:18:34,326 --> 01:18:35,959
No, they're all fucked.

1080
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:53,010
Good morning.

1081
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:54,812
Peter.

1082
01:18:55,413 --> 01:18:56,913
You want one?

1083
01:18:57,615 --> 01:18:58,782
I don't smoke.

1084
01:18:58,850 --> 01:19:01,185
Oh, that's good.
I don't much either.

1085
01:19:13,865 --> 01:19:16,132
You tired?

1086
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,135
Of what? Remember,
I don't work as hard as you.

1087
01:19:19,203 --> 01:19:20,303
That's not true.

1088
01:19:20,372 --> 01:19:22,138
No, it is, actually.

1089
01:19:26,093 --> 01:19:27,695
We all getting
fired tonight?

1090
01:19:27,762 --> 01:19:29,029
Probably.

1091
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:32,466
Are they going
to fire you?

1092
01:19:32,534 --> 01:19:34,868
They won't exactly
call it that.

1093
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:38,171
It'll be a mercy
killing, really.

1094
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,174
You don't have to stand
out here for me.

1095
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:43,276
No, I don't

1096
01:19:43,345 --> 01:19:46,580
really want to go back
in there just yet.

1097
01:19:46,648 --> 01:19:48,315
I understand that.

1098
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:52,619
I think I know
your son.

1099
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,087
Really?

1100
01:19:54,155 --> 01:19:57,925
Not well, but he always
seemed like a nice person.

1101
01:19:57,992 --> 01:20:00,111
He is a nice person.

1102
01:20:00,178 --> 01:20:04,031
I guess you could say
worse things about a guy.

1103
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:07,067
Does he know what's
about to happen?

1104
01:20:07,135 --> 01:20:08,752
What do you mean?

1105
01:20:09,754 --> 01:20:11,521
Did you talk to him?

1106
01:20:12,624 --> 01:20:14,758
No, I hadn't even thought...

1107
01:20:19,697 --> 01:20:20,697
Wow.

1108
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:23,800
They are all
coming in now.

1109
01:20:25,036 --> 01:20:26,570
Yes, they are.

1110
01:20:31,743 --> 01:20:34,945
Have you ever done
anything like this?

1111
01:20:35,013 --> 01:20:37,281
No, never. Not even close.

1112
01:20:38,916 --> 01:20:39,916
Oh.

1113
01:20:40,885 --> 01:20:42,019
Yeah.

1114
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:47,491
Are you sure
it's the only,

1115
01:20:49,027 --> 01:20:51,028
or the right
thing to do?

1116
01:20:54,348 --> 01:20:55,649
For who?

1117
01:20:58,220 --> 01:20:59,687
I'm not sure.

1118
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,022
Neither am I.

1119
01:21:36,457 --> 01:21:37,758
Oh, God.

1120
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,644
You all right?

1121
01:22:49,814 --> 01:22:52,082
You're about
to fire me.

1122
01:23:07,882 --> 01:23:11,518
This is all I ever
wanted to do.

1123
01:23:18,727 --> 01:23:19,993
Really?

1124
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:50,974
They're almost ready for you,
Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes.

1125
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,180
You as well, huh?

1126
01:23:57,982 --> 01:23:59,816
Yes.

1127
01:23:59,884 --> 01:24:01,251
Jesus.
Yeah.

1128
01:24:04,122 --> 01:24:05,956
Sorry.
Thank you.

1129
01:24:20,905 --> 01:24:24,290
I didn't think they were going
to be able to get you back here.

1130
01:24:26,294 --> 01:24:28,194
Well, they told me
they were going to

1131
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,297
drag me through hell on everything
over the next two years,

1132
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:33,066
my options,
my health care.

1133
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,569
Or I could come
back here and make

1134
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:40,824
$176,471 an hour

1135
01:24:40,892 --> 01:24:42,993
to sit quietly
in this room.

1136
01:24:44,495 --> 01:24:46,996
Didn't seem like
much of a choice.

1137
01:24:47,715 --> 01:24:49,216
It never is.

1138
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:57,608
Obviously, looking back,
it was expressed with

1139
01:24:58,643 --> 01:25:01,345
insufficient urgency,

1140
01:25:01,412 --> 01:25:04,914
but your point was passed on.
I need you to know that.

1141
01:25:06,050 --> 01:25:07,166
Eric.

1142
01:25:07,234 --> 01:25:09,703
It's okay.
I understand.

1143
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:12,538
Believe me. There was nothing
else you could have done.

1144
01:25:13,307 --> 01:25:14,641
I guess.

1145
01:25:17,712 --> 01:25:20,981
At the time, it didn't seem like
there was much of a choice.

1146
01:25:21,833 --> 01:25:23,366
It never does.

1147
01:25:34,028 --> 01:25:35,795
You have kids, yeah?

1148
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:37,731
Mmm-hmm.

1149
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:48,625
So, what's your package
going to be like?

1150
01:25:51,195 --> 01:25:54,497
I don't know.
That's what I'm waiting for now.

1151
01:25:54,565 --> 01:25:57,234
It's probably going
to be pretty good.

1152
01:25:58,302 --> 01:25:59,770
It better be.

1153
01:26:15,553 --> 01:26:19,172
Thank you all for coming in
a little early this morning.

1154
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:20,473
I know yesterday
was pretty bad,

1155
01:26:20,541 --> 01:26:22,508
and I wish I could say that
today's gonna be less so,

1156
01:26:22,577 --> 01:26:24,911
but that isn't going
to be the case.

1157
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:26,930
Now, I'm supposed to read this
statement to you all here.

1158
01:26:26,998 --> 01:26:28,465
But why don't you just
read it on your own time,

1159
01:26:28,532 --> 01:26:32,202
and I'll just tell you what
the fuck is going on here.

1160
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:37,507
I've been here all night meeting
with the executive committee,

1161
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:40,677
and the decision has been made
to unwind a considerable portion

1162
01:26:40,744 --> 01:26:44,114
of the firm's holdings
and several key asset classes.

1163
01:26:47,034 --> 01:26:50,436
The crux of it is,
in the firm's thinking,

1164
01:26:50,504 --> 01:26:53,873
the party is over
as of this morning.

1165
01:26:53,941 --> 01:26:58,445
There's gonna be considerable turmoil in
the markets for the foreseeable future,

1166
01:26:58,512 --> 01:27:03,683
and they believe it is better
that this turmoil begin with us.

1167
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,287
As a result,

1168
01:27:07,355 --> 01:27:09,806
the firm has decided
to liquidate

1169
01:27:09,874 --> 01:27:14,177
its majority position
of fixed income MBS today.

1170
01:27:16,247 --> 01:27:17,830
These are your packets.

1171
01:27:17,898 --> 01:27:21,468
You will see what accounts
you're responsible for today.

1172
01:27:22,637 --> 01:27:25,071
I'm sure it hasn't
taken you long

1173
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:29,108
to understand the
implications of this sale

1174
01:27:29,176 --> 01:27:31,110
on your relationships
with your counterparties

1175
01:27:31,178 --> 01:27:32,845
and, as a result,

1176
01:27:34,315 --> 01:27:36,015
on your careers.

1177
01:27:36,083 --> 01:27:40,287
I have expressed this reality
to the executive committee,

1178
01:27:40,354 --> 01:27:42,054
and they understand.

1179
01:27:42,122 --> 01:27:43,573
As a result,

1180
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:47,244
if you achieve a 93%
sale of your assets,

1181
01:27:47,311 --> 01:27:52,633
you will receive a $1.4
million one-off bonus.

1182
01:27:52,700 --> 01:27:57,120
If the floor as a whole
achieves a 93% sale,

1183
01:27:57,221 --> 01:28:03,860
you will get an additional
$1.3 million apiece.

1184
01:28:03,928 --> 01:28:06,963
For those of you who have never
been through this before,

1185
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:09,933
this is what the beginning
of a fire sale looks like.

1186
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:13,703
I cannot begin to tell you how important
the first hour and a half is gonna be.

1187
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:16,339
I want you to hit
every bite you can find.

1188
01:28:16,406 --> 01:28:20,443
Dealers, brokers, clients.
Your mother, if she's buying.

1189
01:28:20,510 --> 01:28:22,645
And, no swaps.

1190
01:28:23,547 --> 01:28:25,648
It's outgoing only. Today.

1191
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:34,190
Obviously, this is not going down the
way that any of us would have hoped.

1192
01:28:34,258 --> 01:28:37,127
But the ground is
shifting below our feet,

1193
01:28:37,194 --> 01:28:40,029
and apparently there's
no other way out.

1194
01:28:58,783 --> 01:28:59,883
Guys,

1195
01:29:02,686 --> 01:29:05,822
this is obviously
a very, very unique situation.

1196
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:09,375
If we are successful today,

1197
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:13,246
we will have been successful
in destroying our own jobs.

1198
01:29:14,532 --> 01:29:18,401
I cannot promise that
any of you, all of you,

1199
01:29:18,469 --> 01:29:22,906
some of you will be
repositioned within the firm.

1200
01:29:22,974 --> 01:29:28,011
But I can tell you that I am very proud of
the work that we have done here together.

1201
01:29:30,181 --> 01:29:35,118
I've been at this
place 34 years,

1202
01:29:35,186 --> 01:29:37,654
and I can tell you from experience
that people are going to say

1203
01:29:37,722 --> 01:29:40,857
some very nasty things
about what we do here today

1204
01:29:40,925 --> 01:29:44,627
and about what you've dedicated
a portion of your lives to.

1205
01:29:45,396 --> 01:29:47,663
But,

1206
01:29:47,731 --> 01:29:53,136
have faith that in the bigger picture,
our skills have not been wasted.

1207
01:29:53,204 --> 01:29:55,205
We have accomplished much,

1208
01:29:55,273 --> 01:29:58,175
and our talents have been used

1209
01:30:00,545 --> 01:30:03,280
for the greater good.

1210
01:30:03,347 --> 01:30:05,698
Here's your packets.
Get to work.

1211
01:30:41,235 --> 01:30:43,286
<i>City, this is Eric.
Give me Elliot.</i>

1212
01:30:44,822 --> 01:30:46,306
<i>City.
Hey, it's Will Emerson.</i>

1213
01:30:46,374 --> 01:30:47,373
<i>William, how are you?</i>

1214
01:30:47,441 --> 01:30:49,209
I'm all right. How's
the trouble and strife?

1215
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:51,477
<i>Busting my ass, as always.</i>

1216
01:30:51,545 --> 01:30:53,179
You see, that's what I tried to tell you,
John. Why do you think I'm single?

1217
01:30:53,247 --> 01:30:55,048
<i>I know you did.
What can I do for you?</i>

1218
01:30:55,115 --> 01:30:56,816
Listen. I just got
the tap on my shoulder,

1219
01:30:56,884 --> 01:30:58,852
and we've got some risk over
here that we need to move.

1220
01:30:58,919 --> 01:31:01,221
So today it looks like
my loss is your gain.

1221
01:31:01,288 --> 01:31:02,856
<i>What kind of size
are we talking?</i>

1222
01:31:02,923 --> 01:31:04,841
It should be on your
screen. I just sent it.

1223
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,609
<i>Jesus! Where does this land?</i>

1224
01:31:06,677 --> 01:31:08,778
<i>96 on the dollar.
91.</i>

1225
01:31:08,780 --> 01:31:10,196
All three and we're
done at 94.

1226
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:12,332
<i>Ninety-three and a half.
Done.</i>

1227
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:15,735
<i>Trading.
Hello, gorgeous.</i>

1228
01:31:15,803 --> 01:31:17,487
<i>Will, what's happening
over there?</i>

1229
01:31:17,554 --> 01:31:19,055
Well, today's moving day.

1230
01:31:19,123 --> 01:31:21,357
<i>Fuck are you guys
so worked up about?</i>

1231
01:31:21,425 --> 01:31:24,894
You think they tell me anything? All I
know is that today, my loss is your gain.

1232
01:31:24,962 --> 01:31:27,130
Now you're a friendly,
so I've come to you first.

1233
01:31:27,197 --> 01:31:31,100
I got 270 mil at 15 year paying
out a point and a half above par.

1234
01:31:31,168 --> 01:31:34,353
<i>Where's it from?
Where's it from? Do you care?</i>

1235
01:31:34,421 --> 01:31:35,638
<i>No, not really.</i>

1236
01:31:35,940 --> 01:31:37,640
<i>Now, where's the trade?
I'm hearing things...</i>

1237
01:31:37,642 --> 01:31:39,425
<i>Alexis...
You guys are scaring me a little.</i>

1238
01:31:39,427 --> 01:31:42,679
I'm only sharing this
with you right now. 85.

1239
01:31:44,531 --> 01:31:45,531
<i>Done.</i>

1240
01:31:47,201 --> 01:31:49,519
<i>Deutsche.
It's Will Emerson.</i>

1241
01:31:49,586 --> 01:31:51,487
<i>Fuck you, you limey bastard.</i>

1242
01:31:51,555 --> 01:31:53,089
Come on, are you
still angry about that?

1243
01:31:53,157 --> 01:31:55,625
<i>Word is out. I'm
hanging up now.</i>

1244
01:31:56,944 --> 01:31:58,945
<i>Merrill.
Lawrence!</i>

1245
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,597
<i>What the fuck are
you guys doing over there?</i>

1246
01:32:00,665 --> 01:32:02,666
<i>Just a little spring cleaning.
That is not what I'm hearing.</i>

1247
01:32:02,733 --> 01:32:04,367
All right, Lawrence,
are you a buyer?

1248
01:32:04,435 --> 01:32:06,336
<i>I'm not sure anymore.
Where at?</i>

1249
01:32:06,404 --> 01:32:08,304
Well, it sounds like I should
be asking you where at.

1250
01:32:08,372 --> 01:32:09,506
<i>What are we
talking about here?</i>

1251
01:32:09,573 --> 01:32:11,808
Three hundred seventy-five
mil at 30 year mixed.

1252
01:32:11,876 --> 01:32:14,878
<i>Fuck me.
Are you with me on this?</i>

1253
01:32:14,979 --> 01:32:17,297
<i>Sixty-three cents.
Oh, fuck you. I'm hanging up.</i>

1254
01:32:17,365 --> 01:32:19,599
<i>Sixty-three.</i>

1255
01:32:19,666 --> 01:32:21,818
Let me call my man here.
I'll come back to you in five.

1256
01:32:21,886 --> 01:32:24,037
<i>It may be 55 in 5.</i>

1257
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:26,956
Well, all right, then.
Stay on the line.

1258
01:32:27,024 --> 01:32:29,209
Sam, pick up the phone.

1259
01:32:29,276 --> 01:32:31,745
<i>- Sam, get on the line!
- Yeah.</i>

1260
01:32:31,812 --> 01:32:33,363
<i>I got Lawrence at Merrill.
Where are we?</i>

1261
01:32:33,430 --> 01:32:35,165
<i>Sixty-three cents.
Jesus.</i>

1262
01:32:35,232 --> 01:32:37,683
<i>On what?
375 mix 30.</i>

1263
01:32:37,751 --> 01:32:39,319
<i>Get him to 65 and hit it.</i>

1264
01:32:39,386 --> 01:32:41,370
Are you fucking
kidding me? That's...

1265
01:32:41,438 --> 01:32:45,008
What is that? That's a $131
million loss on a single trade.

1266
01:32:45,076 --> 01:32:47,277
<i>I understand. Hit it.</i>

1267
01:32:48,429 --> 01:32:51,464
Hey, Lawrence.
We're fill or kill at 65.

1268
01:32:51,532 --> 01:32:52,698
<i>It's filled.</i>

1269
01:33:16,373 --> 01:33:17,673
Well done.

1270
01:33:24,714 --> 01:33:26,282
I just want to give
you a heads up.

1271
01:33:26,350 --> 01:33:29,885
They're going to start sending
a few people home now.

1272
01:33:32,089 --> 01:33:33,155
Now?

1273
01:33:33,223 --> 01:33:35,191
Yes, Sam.
No loose ends.

1274
01:33:41,565 --> 01:33:42,932
Of course.

1275
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:46,219
And for what it's worth,

1276
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:49,088
you're still good.

1277
01:33:51,858 --> 01:33:55,111
Yeah, I guess someone
upstairs really likes you.

1278
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:50,716
Sam.

1279
01:34:52,153 --> 01:34:53,719
Please, sit.

1280
01:34:53,787 --> 01:34:57,057
Congratulations are
clearly in order.

1281
01:34:57,124 --> 01:35:00,143
They did the
best they could.

1282
01:35:00,211 --> 01:35:04,097
You did a hell of a job.
And I thank you for it. Come on, sit.

1283
01:35:04,865 --> 01:35:06,265
Excuse me for eating,

1284
01:35:08,068 --> 01:35:09,835
but it's been a long day.

1285
01:35:09,903 --> 01:35:12,972
Can I get you something?
No, nothing. Thanks.

1286
01:35:16,193 --> 01:35:18,227
So, what can I do for you?

1287
01:35:18,295 --> 01:35:19,696
I want out.

1288
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:23,299
I'm done. I want out.

1289
01:35:25,485 --> 01:35:26,986
It's been a very difficult
day for everyone.

1290
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:28,354
I need you to release
my options, if they're

1291
01:35:28,421 --> 01:35:31,073
worth anything after today.
I want my bonus. I'm out.

1292
01:35:31,141 --> 01:35:33,943
You'll get your bonus, your options,
and keep your current base.

1293
01:35:34,011 --> 01:35:37,380
But I need you to stay with me
for the next 24 months, okay?

1294
01:35:41,418 --> 01:35:43,353
Oh, come on, Sam.

1295
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:44,737
Put a smile on your face.

1296
01:35:44,804 --> 01:35:47,540
You did some good today.
You said that yourself.

1297
01:35:47,607 --> 01:35:50,910
Do you know, I'm starting to feel a
little better about this whole thing.

1298
01:35:53,230 --> 01:35:55,948
You're one of the luckiest
guys in the world, Sam.

1299
01:35:56,016 --> 01:35:57,900
Could have been digging
ditches all these years.

1300
01:35:59,036 --> 01:36:01,003
That's true.

1301
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:04,607
And if I had, at least there'd be some
holes in the ground to show for it.

1302
01:36:06,059 --> 01:36:07,493
Jesus.

1303
01:36:07,795 --> 01:36:10,746
I just don't know how we
fucked this up quite so much.

1304
01:36:14,618 --> 01:36:16,619
When did you start feeling
so sorry for yourself?

1305
01:36:16,686 --> 01:36:19,104
It's unbearable. What?

1306
01:36:19,173 --> 01:36:22,708
So you think we might have put a
few people out of business today.

1307
01:36:22,776 --> 01:36:25,345
That's all for naught.

1308
01:36:25,412 --> 01:36:30,766
But you've been doing that every
day for almost 40 years, Sam.

1309
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:34,603
And if this is all for naught,
then so is everything out there.

1310
01:36:37,374 --> 01:36:39,075
It's just money.

1311
01:36:39,709 --> 01:36:42,245
It's made up,

1312
01:36:42,313 --> 01:36:44,013
pieces of paper with
pictures on it

1313
01:36:44,081 --> 01:36:48,234
so that we don't have to kill each
other just to get something to eat.

1314
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:50,236
It's not wrong.

1315
01:36:50,304 --> 01:36:53,506
And it's certainly no different
today than it's ever been.

1316
01:36:54,858 --> 01:36:57,727
1637, 1797,

1317
01:36:57,795 --> 01:37:02,164
1819, 1837, 1857, 1884,

1318
01:37:04,067 --> 01:37:06,502
1901, 1907,

1319
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:10,422
1929, 1937, 1974,

1320
01:37:10,490 --> 01:37:13,559
1987, Jesus.
Didn't that fucker fuck me up good.

1321
01:37:13,626 --> 01:37:16,762
1992, 1997, 2000, and whatever
we want to call this.

1322
01:37:16,830 --> 01:37:21,534
It's all just the same thing, over
and over. We can't help ourselves.

1323
01:37:21,602 --> 01:37:25,171
And you and I
can't control it

1324
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:28,107
or stop it or
even slow it.

1325
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:30,493
Or even ever
so slightly alter it.

1326
01:37:31,394 --> 01:37:33,696
We just react.

1327
01:37:33,763 --> 01:37:36,065
And we make a lot of money
if we get it right.

1328
01:37:36,133 --> 01:37:39,101
And we get left by the side of
the road if we get it wrong.

1329
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:41,037
And there have always been
and there always will be

1330
01:37:41,104 --> 01:37:42,771
the same percentage
of winners and losers,

1331
01:37:42,840 --> 01:37:44,373
happy fucks and sad sacks,

1332
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:47,093
fat cats and starving
dogs in this world.

1333
01:37:49,146 --> 01:37:50,230
Yeah.

1334
01:37:51,699 --> 01:37:54,701
There may be more of us today
than there's ever been.

1335
01:37:54,768 --> 01:37:58,170
But the percentages,
they stay exactly the same.

1336
01:38:17,724 --> 01:38:21,560
I'll do it, John, but not
because of your little speech.

1337
01:38:21,628 --> 01:38:25,131
But because I
need the money.

1338
01:38:25,198 --> 01:38:29,835
Hard to believe after all these
years, but I need the money.

1339
01:38:33,256 --> 01:38:34,490
This is the executive
dining room.

1340
01:38:34,692 --> 01:38:37,193
Do you want coffee or tea?
No.

1341
01:38:41,381 --> 01:38:43,349
You gonna keep the kid?

1342
01:38:44,851 --> 01:38:48,020
Keep him? He's
getting promoted.

1343
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:49,955
It's all hands
on deck now, Sam.

1344
01:38:50,023 --> 01:38:52,408
There's going to be a lot of money
to be made coming out of this mess,

1345
01:38:52,475 --> 01:38:56,162
and we're gonna need all the
brains we can get around here.

1346
01:40:20,330 --> 01:40:21,631
Hello.

1347
01:40:23,099 --> 01:40:24,833
I've called the police.

1348
01:40:24,901 --> 01:40:26,068
Mary.

1349
01:40:26,736 --> 01:40:28,237
Sam.
Yep.

1350
01:40:31,074 --> 01:40:32,841
What are
you doing?

1351
01:40:48,792 --> 01:40:50,759
Sam, what
are you doing?

1352
01:40:52,896 --> 01:40:54,397
Ella died.

1353
01:41:20,106 --> 01:41:24,527
I was driving home from the vet and I
couldn't think of where else to go.

1354
01:41:26,029 --> 01:41:28,797
She belongs here.
I know.

1355
01:41:28,865 --> 01:41:31,400
But, Sam, you don't
live here anymore.

1356
01:41:37,357 --> 01:41:39,057
Are you all right?

1357
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,161
You don't
look so good.

1358
01:41:43,963 --> 01:41:46,132
Yeah, it's been a rough
day all the way around.

1359
01:41:46,199 --> 01:41:48,334
I know, Sammy called.

1360
01:41:48,401 --> 01:41:49,468
Is he all right?

1361
01:41:49,536 --> 01:41:52,605
They got hammered,
but they got out alive.

1362
01:41:52,672 --> 01:41:53,939
Good.

1363
01:42:01,565 --> 01:42:03,966
Well, I'm gonna
go back inside

1364
01:42:06,136 --> 01:42:08,804
and go back to bed.

1365
01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:11,740
The alarm is on, so
don't try and break in.

1366
01:42:21,150 --> 01:42:22,952
Take care of yourself.
