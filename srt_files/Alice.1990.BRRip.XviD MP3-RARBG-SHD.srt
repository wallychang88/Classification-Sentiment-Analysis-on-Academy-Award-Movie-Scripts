- Yes.

Don't sit her by Ray Poole's wife. She'll
ask if he's moving to Kidder Peabody.

- An eel trap?

Maybe for a lamp base
or a dried flower arrangement?

- Interesting, yeah.
- Live with it for a while.

- Are they?

It isn't even that he's so handsome.

That's funny. My trainer
mentioned him this morning.

He's not just an acupuncturist.
He's a diagnostician.

He took Jean Lewis's pulse
and told her she would develop an ulcer.

No Western doctor could find it.
Six months later she fell over with pain.

Don't forget Dr Yang.
His herbs are marvellous.

They're not chemicals.
They're all natural substances.

Every Western doctor wanted to operate.

00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,512
There was a young man once.

165
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:50,138
- Not husband?
- No.

166
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:55,153
Feelings for my husband
are different.

167
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:58,230
What are deepest feelings
for husband?

168
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,275
I love him, but I...

169
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:04,663
But what, Mrs Tait?

170
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:08,866
Please tell husband.
Husband here in room.

171
00:15:09,785 --> 00:15:13,205
You see him? Tell him.
But what, Mrs Tait?

172
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,711
I'm the wife, you know,
I take care of the kids,

173
00:15:18,836 --> 00:15:23,046
I host the dinner parties,
arrange the social schedule,

174
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:27,303
try to look pretty
so your friends can admire your taste.

175
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:32,018
I've become one of those women
who shops all day and gets pedicures.

176
00:15:32,141 --> 00:15:34,441
But I wanna be more.
There's more to me.

177
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,940
- You have children to raise.
- I can still raise the children.

178
00:15:39,064 --> 00:15:42,484
I wanna do something with my life
before it's too late.

179
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,409
- Do what?
- I don't know what. There's lots I can do.

180
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:50,160
Every time I ask you to be specific,
you become tongue-tied.

181
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:53,084
I had a career.
I gave up a career to marry you.

182
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:57,043
What career? You were a small-town girl
with a Catholic school background...

183
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,496
I was working!

184
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,585
You were struggling
to break into the fashion industry.

185
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,802
I was struggling
because I was young.

186
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,512
You were so pretty.

187
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,718
And we went for a drive
to that amusement park.

188
00:16:09,845 --> 00:16:12,925
(♪ ARTIE SHAW & HIS ORCHESTRA:
"Moonglow")

189
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,016
- (Alice) I can't stay out too late.
- Why not?

190
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:19,063
I have to help the costume designer
shop in the morning.

191
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:21,228
The show opens in six weeks.

192
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:26,856
- Is the costume designer your boyfriend?
- No. I don't exactly have a boyfriend.

193
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:29,027
If I did, I wouldn't be here.

194
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,947
You're very beautiful.

195
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,669
- And you're very rich.
- No, I'm not, actually.

196
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:44,341
My family is,
but... I wanna make it on my own.

197
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,384
- And I will.
- I'm sure you will.

198
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,269
- (Doug) And what are your plans?
- Oh, definitely something in fashion.

199
00:16:56,391 --> 00:17:02,271
A designer for the theatre, or costume
designing, just regular clothing designer.

200
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,107
I don't know. It's still just a dream.

201
00:17:07,110 --> 00:17:11,070
And if I said marry me,
and have my children

202
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,118
and stay by my side,
and be Mrs Douglas Tait?

203
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:16,623
(Alice laughs)

204
00:17:16,745 --> 00:17:21,455
I'd say you were getting ahead
of yourself. After all, we just met.

205
00:17:22,334 --> 00:17:24,884
But I'll confess
you're very handsome.

206
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,850
(Dr Yang) And now, Mrs Tait?

207
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,112
Now I spend hours

208
00:17:44,731 --> 00:17:48,241
trying so hard
to hold on to my youth.

209
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:52,066
And he doesn't notice.

210
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:57,077
- Mrs Tait angry.
- I'm at a crossroads.

211
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:00,752
I'm lost.

212
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,288
I'm lost.

213
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,247
Sleep. Sleep.

214
00:18:06,378 --> 00:18:08,628
Deeper. Deeper.

215
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:16,308
At the count of three,
you will awaken and remember nothing.

216
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:20,600
You will have no memories
of these trance feelings. None.

217
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:24,062
You will not be upset by them.

218
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:28,189
One: you are coming out.

219
00:18:29,234 --> 00:18:32,784
Two: you are nearly conscious.

220
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,324
Three...

221
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:39,908
Maybe I strained my back
playing tennis, you know?

222
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:43,497
My husband was trying to teach me,
but I'm not athletic.

223
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:46,084
Relax, Mrs Tait. Just relax.

224
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:50,089
We will start the treatment
with these herbs.

225
00:18:52,132 --> 00:18:54,262
What is schedule for today?

226
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:57,054
Oh, well, I was gonna do
a little shopping.

227
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:01,099
And then I was going to, er...
to, er...

228
00:19:02,267 --> 00:19:03,727
Yes?

229
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,230
...to pick up my children at school.

230
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,776
Or maybe not. No, I think
I'll let the baby-sitter do that.

231
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:17,121
Mrs Tait, Dr Yang would like you
to go through day as planned.

232
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,740
- Sudden changes too impulsive.
- Really?

233
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:25,539
Mrs Tait should take lunch
with no shellfish.

234
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:29,376
Then, at 2:30,
she will take herbs, yes?

235
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:33,383
- 2:30. All right.
- After, she can retrieve children.

236
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:37,047
- But these are not dangerous, are they?
- Very mild.

237
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:41,347
Will take effect quickly.
Will wear off quickly.

238
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:42,813
Mild.

00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:57,111
Mrs Tait, you wanted some water.

00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,569
Is it 2:30 already?

242
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,080
Just about.

243
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:38,088
Your eyes are really on fire.

244
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,138
Thank you.

- Joe Rufallo-Tufallo.

246
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,359
What do you do, Joe?

247
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,204
Er... I'm a musician.

248
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:04,279
Saxophone?

249
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:06,827
How did you know?

250
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:09,752
You look like you blow tenor to me.

251
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:13,752
Well, you hit it right on the head.

252
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:18,260
- Actually, I'm in rehearsal now.
- Rehearsal?

253
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:22,380
Yeah, for a tribute to Duke Ellington.

254
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:26,049
- The Duke? My favourite, Joe.
- Is he?

255
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,599
Oh! So...

256
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:34,225
What number reed do you use?

257
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:37,114
- Reed?
- Reed, Joe.

258
00:22:37,232 --> 00:22:40,442
- Between the lips.
- Yeah, er... A three.

259
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:42,609
- Do you play tenor?
- No.

260
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:45,737
I just... love the sax.

261
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,488
Yeah. Well, it's a great horn.

262
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:52,209
- Oh, the best.
- Yeah.

263
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,998
I'm fooling around a little
with a soprano now, too.

264
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,996
Really? Soprano?

265
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:00,128
- Uh-huh.
- Joe.

266
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:04,551
That'll extend your range.
You know that, don't you?

267
00:23:04,676 --> 00:23:07,046
- Yeah.
- So...

268
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:10,635
Tell me, Joe.

269
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,765
Your wife, a musician too?

270
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:16,524
- Er... I'm not married.
- Not married?

271
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:18,976
- No.
- Joe.

272
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,607
And you love Edna Millay.

273
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,781
- Yeah...
- Yeah. My favourite.

274
00:23:26,907 --> 00:23:29,157
- I know that.
- Yeah.

275
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,580
So I was just thinking,

276
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:37,535
we should get together
and talk about her, don't you think?

277
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,537
- I think so.
- Yes.

278
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,129
When?

279
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:45,474
- When, Joe?
- Tomorrow. Yeah.

280
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,891
What time?

281
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,012
You tell me.

282
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:55,812
Three o'clock.
Inside the penguin house.

283
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,976
At the zoo.

284
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,154
- Great. Great.
- Super.

285
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:05,403
So, one last thing.

286
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:11,238
I remember the first time
I heard Coltrane on soprano.

287
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:15,538
Until then, it had just been tenor,
of course, but...

288
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:18,124
It was such a moment, Joe.

289
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,669
Opened a whole new world
of harmonics for me.

290
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:24,341
- Really?
- Really.

291
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,932
I'll leave you with that, Joe.

292
00:24:28,051 --> 00:24:30,511
I'll see you tomorrow at the zoo.

293
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,273
The penguin house!
That's what I said.

294
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:40,145
- (Nina) In the zoo?
- Yes.

295
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,191
- You suggested this?
- Yes. I couldn't believe I said it.

296
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:46,066
- I thought somebody else was talking.
- That's great.

297
00:24:46,194 --> 00:24:49,164
The words were just coming out,
I had no idea what I was saying.

298
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,160
I had no idea what anything even meant.
I was talking about reeds.

299
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,664
- Coltrane. Who's Coltrane?
- What is that?

300
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:58,117
- That's what I wanna know.
- You probably read it.

301
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:00,708
I was so forward, too.
I can't believe it.

302
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:02,794
Completely obnoxious.

303
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:04,919
Yes, but he was responsive.

304
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:08,006
Yes, but I'm telling you,
it was like I was possessed.

305
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:11,973
Really. I'm saying, "A whole new world
of harmonics opened up for me."

306
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,845
- Harmonics?
- Harmonics.

307
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,142
What do I know about harmonics?

308
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:18,846
Well, is he nice?
What did you find out about him?

309
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,437
- Well, he's not married.
- Good.

310
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,193
He's in rehearsal
at someplace called Park East.

311
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:27,106
- Uh-huh.
- Sound East.

312
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:31,355
And he's rehearsing something,
kind of a Duke Ellington tribute.

313
00:25:31,489 --> 00:25:35,289
What have I done?
I can't meet a strange man at the zoo.

314
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:37,450
- Why not?
- I'm not like Jane.

315
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:40,829
- I'm not looking for a roll in the hay.
- What are you looking for?

316
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:43,997
Listen, not a word of this.
You mustn't breathe a word.

317
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:47,297
- Of course not, I promise.
- God, I have nothing to wear.

318
00:25:47,422 --> 00:25:51,012
- I've gotten so fat. This is not for me.
- Oh, Mitzie.

319
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:53,894
- Hi, darling. We did the best we could.
- Thanks.

320
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,722
Oh, hello, sweetie.
Look at her.

321
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:59,558
Come on, honey. Let's go home.

322
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,940
I love how you made
one purple ear and one green ear.

323
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:10,775
- What colour are you gonna do the tail?
- I don't know. I guess red.

324
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:14,124
- That would be a good idea.
- I could make it orange.

325
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:18,948

326
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,209
- Hi.
- Hi.

327
00:26:21,331 --> 00:26:24,211
Nancy Brill has been made
a big deal on a TV show.

328
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:27,714
She buys scripts now.
I sent her flowers.

329
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:31,837
I'm happy for her, cos she's a friend,
but I must admit I'm a little envious.

330
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:35,046
Oh, Alice, we discussed this.
I thought we agreed.

331
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:40,558
I know. How about if I took some kind
of a course or a class or something?

332
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:42,813
- You mean in school?
- Yeah.

333
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:45,306
- Like what?
- I don't know.

334
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,363
Now I regret I never went to college.

335
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:52,034
At Sacred Heart
I was good at English.

336
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:58,026
Oh, speaking of Sacred Heart, we've
been invited to an evening next month

337
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,159
in honour of Mother Teresa.

338
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,956
Really? Mother Teresa?
You think she'll be there in person?

339
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,593
I expect some of her cronies
will show up.

340
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,090
I wanna bring the kids.
I talk so much about Mother Teresa.

341
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:14,934
- I don't know about that.
- Mother Teresa! She's my idol.

342
00:27:15,051 --> 00:27:18,011
We have to bring them.
It'd be a great experience.

343
00:27:18,138 --> 00:27:19,808
- We'll see.
- Yeah.

344

346
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,743
I can't do it to my husband.

347
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:22,164
All this talk last night of Mother Teresa
just made me feel so guilty.

348
00:28:22,285 --> 00:28:25,575
I believe in fidelity.
It's my upbringing.

349
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:30,075
I'm not gonna commit adultery.
I just can't do it.

350
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:35,550
And who is this guy anyway, you know?
Some horn player? A divorcé?

351
00:28:35,673 --> 00:28:37,973
He's a complete stranger.

352
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,722
I've been married 16 years, Dr Yang.

353
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,595
I can't just go out
and commit adultery.

354
00:28:43,723 --> 00:28:47,733
Not that I'm so sure he even wants me,
you know? I'm getting older.

355
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:51,982
And what would happen
if I fell in love with him? This is...

356
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:57,606
- I'm just so mixed up.
- Mrs Tait's feelings in titanic conflict.

357
00:28:57,737 --> 00:29:00,447
But Dr Yang has prescription.

358
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:05,043
Oh, you know, yesterday's herbs
made me feel a little strange.

359
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:08,961
These herbs are different.
Very valuable.

360
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:12,842
- Difficult to obtain.
- Are all these completely safe?

361
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:16,551
Best way to get to know strange man
is to observe.

362
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:18,223
Yeah...

363
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,301
It's bitter. What will this do?

364
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:26,018
Enable Mrs Tait to observe
without being observed.

365
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:31,559
What... what is this?

366
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:34,858
- Where am I going? I can't believe this.
- Do not worry.

367
00:29:34,983 --> 00:29:37,993
- Invisibility will wear off shortly.
- I'm invisible!

368
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:41,111
I'm completely gone.
I don't believe it!

369
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:44,199
I never saw anything like this in my life.
Dr Yang, is this safe?

370
00:29:44,325 --> 00:29:46,865
Mrs Tait knows where man
can be found.

371
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,195
It's crazy!

372
00:29:48,329 --> 00:29:51,829
If she wants to learn more about him,
she has chance.

and I wanna take Shana with me.

375
00:30:13,688 --> 00:30:18,148
Just for a week. I know it's not
our arrangement, but I think she'll like it.

376
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:20,856
- I can show her Disneyworld.
- Sure.

377
00:30:20,987 --> 00:30:24,527
- Thanks. I'll make it up to you.
- It's OK. She'll have fun.

378
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:27,657
I hope you're not going
with one of your more exotic escorts.

379
00:30:27,785 --> 00:30:28,995
Like who?

380
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:33,040
Like Peter Wilkes, who enjoys taking
my daughter racing in his Ferrari.

381
00:30:33,166 --> 00:30:36,376
- That was perfectly safe and she loved it.
- But I didn't.

382
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:40,922
- You introduced her to sports cars.
- I feel better when I'm behind the wheel,

383
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:45,679
not some advertising guy whose
glasses have lenses like Coke bottles.

384

Peter's fine. He's very paternal.

Now, listen,
I wanna show you something.

00:30:51,476 --> 00:30:55,016
These are some graphics I've been
working on for a couple of weeks.

387
00:30:55,146 --> 00:30:58,476
I really trust your visual sense.
I think they're brilliant.

388
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:02,028
- Everybody here's a bit ambivalent.
- Sexy stuff.

389
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:03,913
- Yeah.
- Like you.

390
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:06,490
Sort of European. We did it in Paris.

391
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:08,946
- Sort of kinky.
- Kinky...

392
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:11,447
I like that kinky stuff.

393
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,329
Remember the times we used to lock
that door and make love on that couch?

394
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:20,668
- Joe, that was a long time ago.
- No, no. It was after we got divorced.

395
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:24,797
Nobody could fault you for your sex drive
which is a 10 on the Richter scale.

396
00:31:24,926 --> 00:31:29,136
Yeah, well, what did you fault me for?
Because I don't have a 180 IQ like you?

397
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:31,393
You lied a bit, you gambled.

398
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:36,936
- You flirted with all my friends.
- You know, you're still very sexy.

399
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:42,443
Joe, don't think I'm not tempted,
you know, but I've got a busy schedule.

if you didn't see him?

I'm glad I didn't show up.

You know, a vintage Rolls,

Yeah, sure.
I don't know, you know?

You can't just decide
to be a writer and then write.

434

- Why not?
- You need background.

be bad for my system?

then burn these herbs in teacup.

they might make good shows, or a series.

- I wanted to get your opinion on the plot.

493
00:37:49,685 --> 00:37:53,685
And if you think it's something
for your show, I'd like to write it.

494
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:57,784
- You write?
- I wrote a little when I was young.

495
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:01,992
- Nothing major, obviously.
- You kept it a secret if you wrote.

496
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,584
Well, I'd like to try. I'd like to try.

497
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:09,870
- I did work on some shows years ago.
- Wasn't that in the costume department?

498
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:14,417
Yeah, but, you know, at least
I did have some contact with the theatre.

499
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:20,423
Uh-huh. So what's your idea?
Because the truth is, I'm backed up today.

500
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:25,299
Oh, OK. Well, it's about two sisters
who were very close as kids.

501
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,679
And now that they're adults,
they've grown apart.

502
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,689
- Like you and your sister.
- Me?

503
00:38:33,729 --> 00:38:36,569
Aren't you and Dorothy polite
but not so friendly?

504
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,190
Well, gee,
I never even thought of that.

505
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:43,358
Let me stop you. We want
blood-and-guts stuff, not so subtle.

506
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:48,159
Oh, well. I have another about
a young girl who wanted to be a nun.

507
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:53,615
No nuns. They want sexy, unscrupulous,
rich, melodramatic, but no nuns.

508
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:57,499
Listen, anything like that
occurs to you, we'll talk.

509
00:38:57,628 --> 00:38:59,838
Give me a jingle
and we'll go to Le Cirque.

510
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:03,014
OK. All right. Well, thank you.

511
00:39:09,431 --> 00:39:14,731
- (Doug) Is something burning in there?
- No. No, it's OK.

512
00:39:15,729 --> 00:39:18,479
- (Doug) Come to sleep!
- Yeah. Soon.

'It's been almost 20 years.

525
00:40:38,896 --> 00:40:41,856
'Tell me I don't look so bad,
considering I'm dead.'

526
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:45,782
No. Considering you're dead,
you look great.

527

'See? Even if you had married me,
you'd have still been a widow.'

528
00:40:49,698 --> 00:40:52,618
Oh, Eddie, I felt terrible
when I heard about the crash.

529
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:56,503
But I wasn't surprised.
I always said you drove recklessly.

530

'Ah!

531
00:40:58,082 --> 00:41:02,172
'You thought I did everything recklessly,
including making love.'

Not that I wasn't saddened.

was a total accident.

'Boom! Not for a second
did I see that moving van.'

537
00:41:25,776 --> 00:41:27,606
I thought of you the other day.

538
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:31,656
I met an interesting man
who kind of reminded me of you.

539
00:41:31,782 --> 00:41:35,292
'Oh, no.
Do I sense trouble in paradise?'

540
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:39,671
No, no, no. Everything's fine here.
I'm very happy.

'So tell me all about this guy
who reminds you of me.'

542
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:48,335
Well, he's like you.
He's irresponsible and temperamental.

543
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,425
- 'Yeah.'
- But he...

544
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:53,221
He's cute, you know?

545
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:58,267
""Thou shalt not commit adultery."
That's not my line. I read it.'

546
00:41:58,392 --> 00:42:00,442
I'm not. I just met him.

- Oh, I don't know.

551
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:23,248

You think I have that in me?

- Who are you talking to?
- Oh, I was...

553
00:42:28,005 --> 00:42:30,505
I just saw you sitting there
having a conversation.

554
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:34,552
- I was probably just thinking out loud.
- At this hour?

555
00:42:34,678 --> 00:42:37,218
- 'Bottoms and no top. I coulda called it.'
- Quiet!

556
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:41,727
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine. I just had this idea for a story.

557
00:42:41,852 --> 00:42:44,312
So I guess I was acting out
all the parts.

558
00:42:44,438 --> 00:42:46,978
- Alice, that's crazy.
- It's crazy.

559
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:49,487
I'm gonna get some sleep.
I'm gonna go to bed.

560
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:53,740
Me too. I got a long day. I'm gonna be
home late. It's my backgammon night.

561
00:42:53,864 --> 00:42:56,084
- Is tonight backgammon?
- Sweetheart?

562
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,790
- Will you try to relax?
- I will. I'll try.

563
00:42:58,911 --> 00:43:01,461
- You've been awful tense lately.
- Have I been tense?

564

now she wants my opinion?'

569

- Hi.
- Hi.

570
00:43:41,328 --> 00:43:44,828
I, erm... I'm sorry if I bothered you
by calling you at home.

571

- I was concerned.
- No, I'm... It's fine.

572
00:43:48,210 --> 00:43:53,170
I must've seemed a little abrupt. I was
having a conversation with my husband.

It's OK. I understand.

574
00:43:56,885 --> 00:44:00,135
I was disappointed
when you didn't show up at the zoo.

575
00:44:00,264 --> 00:44:04,484
They have this very beautiful
white bear I wanted to show you.

your husband used a line like that?'

- Well, I...
- 'Give him some encouragement.'

'Come on, you can't go to hell
for taking your kids to the circus!'

It was great seeing you again.

654
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:42,111
You're still wonderful.

655
00:49:44,774 --> 00:49:46,614
(Cheering and clapping)

656
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:04,592
Did you get a prize?

657
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:09,668
- So how's the rehearsal coming?
- Oh, fine.

658
00:50:09,799 --> 00:50:13,349
- Great arrangement on "The Mooche".
- "The Mooche"?

659
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,720
- "Mooche," the Ellington number.
- Oh. "The Mooche." Yes.

660
00:50:17,849 --> 00:50:22,399
I figured you'd know it.
You seem so knowledgeable about jazz.

661
00:50:22,521 --> 00:50:26,191
I'm not really, but I'd like to learn.

662
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:39,292
(Cheering)

663
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:50,720
So you're nothing really
like you were the other day.

664
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,430
- (Alice laughs)
- You were coming on so strong.

665
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:56,932
I know. I was just...
I was so obnoxious.

666
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:00,175
I'm so embarrassed. I...

667
00:51:00,308 --> 00:51:05,358
I guess it was to counteract
my shyness or something. I don't know.

668
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:10,280
So this is me. Do you feel...
Are you disappointed?

669
00:51:10,402 --> 00:51:11,952
- No, no.
- No?

670
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,700
- Actually, you scared me a little.
- Really?

671
00:51:14,823 --> 00:51:18,453
No, well...
But I sensed it wasn't you.

672
00:51:18,577 --> 00:51:19,867
Yeah.

673
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:24,002
Look, can I ask you a question?

674
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,464
Sure.

675
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:28,035
What?

676
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,759
Are you happily married?
Or is that tactless?

677
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,380
No. Yes. Yes, I...

678
00:51:33,508 --> 00:51:36,718
Gosh, I've been married
almost 16 years now.

679
00:51:36,845 --> 00:51:38,885
16 years.

680
00:51:39,014 --> 00:51:41,774
Oh. Well, that that's great.

681
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:43,181
Yeah.

682
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:46,271
No, really, erm...

683
00:51:46,396 --> 00:51:49,396
- A good marriage, it's a rare thing.
- Yeah.

684
00:51:52,944 --> 00:51:55,114
Why did you get divorced?

685
00:51:56,781 --> 00:51:59,701
Well, my wife and I,
we were both too opinionated.

686
00:51:59,826 --> 00:52:02,286
She's very brilliant.

687
00:52:02,412 --> 00:52:05,712
Uh-huh. And attractive?

688
00:52:07,459 --> 00:52:08,669
Yes.

689
00:52:09,919 --> 00:52:12,009
- And very sexy.
- Uh-huh.

690
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:17,179
And when you're with her,
do you...

691
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:21,925
Do you still have the urge
to be with her?

692
00:52:24,392 --> 00:52:27,442
- No.
- No?

693
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:32,482
No? You never have the urge to, er...
to grab her?

694
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:37,109
Like, you know, if the two of you are
in her office or something?

695
00:52:37,238 --> 00:52:42,288
Or, I don't know, you know, just throw
her down on the couch or something?

696
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,410
For old times' sake?

697
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,132
Er...

698
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:54,757

(Alice) Here's the story: a woman who's
never done a dishonest thing in her life

702
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:02,453
finds herself falling
into a love affair with a musician.

703
00:54:02,574 --> 00:54:05,704
- It's a little vague, Alice.
- Well... Really? You think?

704
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:09,577
Look, be honest. What do you know
about that kind of woman?

705
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:12,326
- Well, I...
- Who's the woman?

706
00:54:12,459 --> 00:54:15,419
Who's the man?
Who's the poor husband?

707
00:54:15,545 --> 00:54:18,875
Where does it go?
What makes it interesting?

708
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:22,467
Is it lurid? Is it sexual? Perverse?

709
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,644
Is she a whore?

710
00:54:26,014 --> 00:54:28,434
What's the matter? You look pale.

711
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:34,154
(Alice) I know I can write.
I'm just blocked, you know?

714
00:54:39,402 --> 00:54:41,452
Yeah. Yeah, I know you're right.

715
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:43,661
- It's not so...
- It's like me.

716
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:46,662
- I wanted to be a classical musician.
- Yeah?

717
00:54:46,785 --> 00:54:50,905
But it wasn't in me.
So I make my living doing studio work.

719
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:56,340
But I do have a pretty good feel for jazz.

720
00:54:56,461 --> 00:54:59,511
And is that where you...
where you met your wife?

721
00:54:59,631 --> 00:55:01,931
- In commercials?
- Yeah, exactly.

722
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:05,090
We were doing a spot
for some detergent.

723
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:08,140
- Detergent!
- It was love at first sight.

724
00:55:08,264 --> 00:55:12,984
Christ, within half an hour,
we were making love in the ladies' room.

725
00:55:13,102 --> 00:55:16,312
- Oh, excuse me.
- No, that's fine.

726
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:19,529
You have a very charming way
of telling things.

Listen, do you think you can get away
tomorrow evening?

728

A friend of mine is making a record.
It might be fun for you to hear him.

730
00:55:32,121 --> 00:55:36,381
- He's a terrific cellist.
- Well, an evening...

731
00:55:37,836 --> 00:55:40,956
Well, tomorrow evening is
Doug's backgammon night, so...

732
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:44,129
- What time would this be?
- Eight, eight-thirty.

733
00:55:44,259 --> 00:55:47,049
- Eight?
- Yeah. If you like...

734
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:51,018
Well, I can meet you.
How about in front of the school?

735
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:55,020
In front of the school...
An evening...

736
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:57,614
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

737
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,860
That sounds like fun.

738
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:02,573

So, finally, he rented a store
on Lexington Avenue,

741
00:56:16,124 --> 00:56:19,884
and he's gonna bankroll her
and she's opening a boutique.

742
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:22,553
- Oh, really?
- Or a sweater shop.

743
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:26,048
And I thought to myself,
that's something.

744
00:56:26,175 --> 00:56:29,295
Possibly, on a part-time basis,
you could help out.

745
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:32,769
You have a nice personality
and you know sweaters.

746
00:56:34,142 --> 00:56:37,152
It's not really what I had in mind,
you know.

747
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,310
Well, think about it.

- I won't be too late.

751

- I don't know. The usual, nothing much.

Gee, it's after 7.30.
Gosh. You don't wanna be late.

754
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:04,012

we had that little problem a while ago.

I can't stay too long.
I'm supposed to be visiting my sister.

817
01:03:29,807 --> 01:03:34,267
- A-ha! Intrigue?
- No, no, you know. I just...

818
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:45,413
It's a dumb lie, because
my sister and I aren't close at all.

819
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:50,411
I'd like to be. She and her husband
moved here recently from Philadelphia.

820
01:03:50,536 --> 01:03:52,576
She's a very fine attorney.

821
01:03:53,748 --> 01:03:57,338
Would you mind holding that
a little closer, please?

822
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:06,682
Oh, this is relaxing.

823
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:12,562
Oh, I... I was very surly with
a gentleman friend earlier, you know.

824
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:15,773
I behaved like a real bitch.
Excuse my French.

825
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,555
Mrs Tait feel more calm?

826
01:04:19,690 --> 01:04:22,280
As a matter of fact, I do. I do.

827
01:04:22,401 --> 01:04:24,451
This is...

828
01:04:25,905 --> 01:04:29,445
Everything seems to be floating.

829
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:37,214
I think I'll just lie down for a moment,
if you don't mind.

831
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:32,260
(Alice) Gee, Dorothy,
what happened to our house?

832
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:34,428
It's so run-down.

833
01:05:34,932 --> 01:05:39,482
I understand you used me as an alibi
tonight to get out of the house.

834
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:43,023
(Alice) What went wrong?
We used to be so close.

835
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:48,609
- We chose different paths.
- Yeah. And you think mine is trivial.

836
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:52,317
Anybody who spends that much
on stuffed animals for their children...

837
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:55,240
I know how you feel.
You made it very clear last time.

838
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:59,959
People are starving and you fill
the nursery with every conceivable toy.

839
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,792
Isn't there any way
that you could respect me?

840
01:06:02,918 --> 01:06:05,668
You're just like Mom.

841
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:10,886
Yeah. You know, I've been thinking
about Mom and Dad a lot lately.

842
01:06:11,010 --> 01:06:14,470
Remember how Dad used to cut
our birthday cakes with his sword?

843
01:06:14,597 --> 01:06:18,387
- (Dorothy) You bought all that junk?
- He was a naval hero!

844
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:20,767
Come on. He was a bore
and Mom was a drunk.

845
01:06:20,895 --> 01:06:22,935
Come on. Don't say that.

846
01:06:23,063 --> 01:06:25,113
So, who are you cheating with?

847
01:06:25,232 --> 01:06:28,242
I'm not cheating. Not physically.

848
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:30,780
You know, not yet, anyway.

849
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:34,275
You probably still believe
what the nuns told us at Sacred Heart.

850
01:06:34,408 --> 01:06:38,578
My days as a Catholic
ended when I was about 16.

851
01:06:38,704 --> 01:06:42,544
My days as a Catholic ended
when Mom found my diaphragm.

852
01:06:42,666 --> 01:06:46,916
But the music was beautiful, wasn't it?
And the rituals.

853
01:06:47,046 --> 01:06:50,216
Go on, have one more confession.
It's free.

854
01:07:10,986 --> 01:07:14,276
(Alice) My sister's been right
about so many things.

855
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,906
I am too much like Mom.

856
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:22,622
Sometimes I think I'm not raising
my children with the right values.

857
01:07:22,748 --> 01:07:24,788
That I'm spoiling them.

858
01:07:24,917 --> 01:07:28,417
Not exposing them
to the things that matter most.

859
01:07:29,964 --> 01:07:32,554
When I was young,
I wanted to be a saint.

860
01:07:32,675 --> 01:07:37,135
'I used to pray with my arms outstretched
because it was more painful

861
01:07:37,263 --> 01:07:39,813

862
01:07:41,016 --> 01:07:44,096

a chance to help out that way.

'What happened?
Where did that part of me go?'

866
01:08:01,245 --> 01:08:04,325
And now, even my marriage.

867
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,666
I'm so mixed up about it.

868
01:08:07,585 --> 01:08:10,125
And I feel guilty about Joe.

869
01:08:12,131 --> 01:08:14,171
God, I'm exhausted.

870
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:19,931
- You have curls.
- I only have one. You have so many.

871
01:08:20,055 --> 01:08:23,635
You know, I'm crazy about these.
These are just absolutely...

872
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,187
- Oh, Alice. Hi.
- Hi.

873
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:28,902
- This is Joanne, this is Kimberly.
- Hi.

874
01:08:29,023 --> 01:08:32,693
See you later. How are Dennis and
Kate doing? Have they adjusted?

875
01:08:32,818 --> 01:08:36,408
- They're doing real well.
- I am having terrible problems with Perry.

876
01:08:36,530 --> 01:08:40,030
Every time I leave the house, he cries.
Especially if "Sesame Street" isn't on.

877
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:42,829
- He needs more sessions on the couch.
- That could be.

878
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:45,713
You were gonna call me
about Jessica's birthday party.

879
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:49,381
- Of course they'll come.
- They'll have a magician. I have an idea.

880
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:53,011
I want Kate to have a play-date
next weekend with Perry in Southampton.

881
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,300
I'll have my chauffeur pick them up
directly from school.

882
01:08:56,425 --> 01:09:00,845
- Gee, can I call you about that?
- Please. They're looking forward to it.

883
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:02,891
- Hi. How are you?
- Great.

884
01:09:03,015 --> 01:09:06,595
Perry would like to invite Shana to
the movies in his dad's screening room.

885
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:09,767
- They're showing "The Little Mermaid".
- Sure.

886
01:09:09,897 --> 01:09:13,647
He's really sorry for the last time.
He didn't mean to vomit on her collage.

887
01:09:13,776 --> 01:09:16,026
- I've gotta run. Call me.
- I'll call you.

888
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,453
Bye-bye.

889
01:09:19,365 --> 01:09:22,485
Listen, I'm really sorry about last night.

890
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,788
No, no, it's OK.
Can we talk in private for a minute?

891
01:09:25,913 --> 01:09:27,293
Yeah.

892
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:33,296
I was thinking, maybe I should
just back off for a little while.

893
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:36,170
- Really?
- Well...

894
01:09:37,049 --> 01:09:41,389
- I can't bear to be the source of trouble.
- Oh, no. It's not you at all.

895
01:09:41,512 --> 01:09:46,482
No, it's me. It's just who I am,
who I've been.

896
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:49,310
I'm just trying to figure out
who that is.

897
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:52,226
That's why I don't wanna be an obstacle.

898
01:09:52,356 --> 01:09:56,606
Really? So you think... you think
we shouldn't meet any more?

899
01:09:57,611 --> 01:09:59,611
Maybe it's for the best.

900
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:04,079
Gee, I was gonna take you
to a neat restaurant for lunch tomorrow.

901
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:07,251
- You were?
- Not if... not if...

902
01:10:15,713 --> 01:10:18,173
Listen, we better get the kids.

903
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:24,806
- Hi. Hi.
- Alice, hi. God. Come on in.

904
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:28,640
- I didn't get you away from anything?
- I was working on a brief, but...

905
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:32,727
- I'm so happy to be taken away from it.
- I was a couple of blocks away.

906
01:10:32,855 --> 01:10:37,645
Dorothy, I just wanted to tell you
that I feel bad about this.

907
01:10:37,776 --> 01:10:40,276
I've been thinking about it and I'm sorry.

908
01:10:40,404 --> 01:10:41,954
Oh, honey, I know.

909
01:10:42,072 --> 01:10:46,792
Listen, I'm the big sister.
I should be kind, and I'm sorry.

910
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:50,000
- Do you want some tea?
- Erm... No.

911
01:10:50,122 --> 01:10:53,002
I didn't handle it well.
I really apologise.

912
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:57,375
- Who am I to be judgmental of your life?
- Listen, be quiet for just a second.

913
01:10:57,504 --> 01:11:01,684
I was... I was wrong.
You know, I was...

914
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:07,720
There's something disgusting about all
the stuff I buy the kids and I buy myself.

915
01:11:07,848 --> 01:11:11,638
- All of that. So you were right.
- But it's your life, you know? Who am I?

916
01:11:11,769 --> 01:11:14,309
You're my sister,
and I care about what you think.

917
01:11:14,438 --> 01:11:18,068
- Yeah?
- And I miss being closer, you know?

918
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:22,202
When you guys moved to the city,
I was hoping that would happen.

919
01:11:22,321 --> 01:11:24,661
I was hoping that too, you know?

920
01:11:24,782 --> 01:11:28,912
I'm sorry, but I was really surprised
to see how you've changed.

921
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:32,366
- I didn't know how to handle it.
- You knew Doug was very wealthy.

922
01:11:32,498 --> 01:11:36,538
Yeah, of course I knew that,
but when I walked in, you know...

923
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:41,968
Oh, God, your closet. Clothes and
a hundred shoes and all that stuff.

924
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:44,340
- It was hard for me, I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

925
01:11:44,468 --> 01:11:46,468
You know, you're just very...

926
01:11:46,595 --> 01:11:50,345
You're different. You have different ideas
than you did when we were kids.

927
01:11:50,474 --> 01:11:54,734
I know that. I know that.
I know that, you're right.

928
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:58,073
But don't you think I wanna be close?

929
01:11:58,190 --> 01:12:00,230
I do.

It's about her working in Calcutta.
It's just so incredibly tragic there.

All these bigwigs are sitting there
with tears running down their faces.

934
01:12:54,955 --> 01:13:00,165
It was just incredibly moving.
She was just so simple and unassuming.

935
01:13:00,294 --> 01:13:04,174
You know? It was amazing.
I was... I was weeping.

936
01:13:04,298 --> 01:13:08,838
The kids were cute though. Dennis,
I think, was just thrilled to be up so late.

937
01:13:08,969 --> 01:13:12,849
But I really think Katie had a feel
for what was going on.

938
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:16,233
- Why are you so nervous?
- I'm not. Why do you say nervous?

939
01:13:16,351 --> 01:13:18,941
You haven't stopped talking.
I've heard this three times.

940
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:21,612
Really, three times?
This is a big step for me.

941
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:26,822
I just feel... Shouldn't it happen
more gradually or something?

942
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:30,195
- It hasn't exactly been rushed.
- Rushed? I don't know.

943
01:13:30,324 --> 01:13:33,914
It feels rushed. It feels rushed.
I've been married now 15 years.

944
01:13:34,036 --> 01:13:36,076
Probably I'm just out of practice.

It's not like juggling.
You don't have to practise.

946

Doug and I do have sex,
but not the way we used to.

947
01:13:43,045 --> 01:13:47,665
Which is probably my fault. Somewhere
along the line I just lost interest.

948
01:13:47,799 --> 01:13:50,889
Then he seemed to.
But probably because I did.

949
01:13:51,011 --> 01:13:54,641
But I don't know why I did.
Anyway, we rarely seem to do it.

950
01:13:54,765 --> 01:13:57,385
- Maybe he lost interest first.
- Shh. Shh.

951
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,307
- What?
- Relax.

952
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:03,266
What's relaxed? It's not even dark.
God, I prefer it when it's dark.

953
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:06,358

- See?

Yes.

960
01:14:41,603 --> 01:14:44,863
Dialogue in fiction
has two functions.

961
01:14:44,982 --> 01:14:50,532
In the novel, to be read to oneself
as voices in the mind.

962
01:14:50,654 --> 01:14:54,534
And in scripts and in plays,
to be read out loud.

963
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:58,407
So that what we're really
talking about here is

964
01:14:58,537 --> 01:15:02,617
the two aspects
of the consciousness of words.

965
01:15:02,749 --> 01:15:07,169
Internal and meditative in the novel,

966
01:15:07,295 --> 01:15:14,045

in the drama and in film.

01:16:19,576 --> 01:16:21,156
My muse?

976
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:24,616
Yeah. You look surprised.
I'm your muse. I'm here to help you.

977
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:28,958
- You're having trouble writing.
- I am having trouble, as a matter of fact.

978
01:16:29,086 --> 01:16:32,336
I feel I should be able to handle
some silly little TV script.

979
01:16:32,464 --> 01:16:35,724
- Well, writing's hard.
- Especially with a friend buying.

980
01:16:35,842 --> 01:16:39,682
- You don't think Nancy's a friend?
- Sure. We go back years.

981
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:42,345
I introduced her to her boss
and the man she lives with.

982
01:16:42,474 --> 01:16:45,274
You're not psychological at all.
How can you be a writer?

983
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:47,443
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

984
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:50,192
What I mean is,
don't ever count on Nancy Brill.

985
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,355
- She's not gonna give you a break.
- No.

986
01:16:52,484 --> 01:16:55,284
You represent
where she pulled herself out of.

987
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,453
- She's passed you.
- Nancy?

988
01:16:57,572 --> 01:17:01,122
Haven't you noticed she keeps checking
her watch when she talks to you?

989
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:05,043
- It can't be. I introduced her to...
- I know, to her lover and her boss.

990
01:17:05,163 --> 01:17:07,173
More reason to give you the brush.

991
01:17:07,290 --> 01:17:10,040
People that made it don't wanna know
people from the past.

992
01:17:10,168 --> 01:17:13,628
- What are you trying to write?
- That's a script.

993
01:17:13,755 --> 01:17:17,085
- I'm also taking a course.
- Well, that's technique.

994
01:17:17,217 --> 01:17:21,427
The important part can't be taught:
Inspiration. That's where I come in.

995
01:17:21,555 --> 01:17:24,095
I think the professor thinks
I have some promise.

996
01:17:24,224 --> 01:17:27,064
- He's very encouraging.
- I know Professor Davis.

997
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:29,515
- He's trying to get you into the sack.
- No.

998
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,816
It's the reason he teaches.
Female pupils.

999
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,030
No. He's very deep.
He's not like that.

1000
01:17:35,152 --> 01:17:38,322
Yeah. Very deep is exactly
where he wants to put it.

1001
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:40,816
- Now, what about your mother?
- What, Mom?

1002
01:17:40,949 --> 01:17:42,329
Yeah, your mother.

1003
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:45,750
She was a movie actress for a while.
Her story might make a good plot.

1004
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:48,831
She was just in the movies
for a very, very short time.

1005
01:17:48,957 --> 01:17:52,127
And she never made it.
Losers are much more interesting.

1006
01:17:52,252 --> 01:17:55,672
- Mom's not a loser.
- Look how defensive you are.

1007
01:17:55,797 --> 01:18:00,217
It's a good story. I know you idolised her,
but be realistic. This is important.

1008
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:04,853
She was in the movies. She made two
or three movies, and then she met Dad.

1009
01:18:04,973 --> 01:18:08,983
And Dad persuaded her to retire.

1010
01:18:09,102 --> 01:18:13,862
No, Alice, I was never more
than a pretty face.

1011
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:17,902
And when it began to wrinkle,
the studio stopped calling.

1012
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:21,028
(Alice) No, there was much more
to you than your looks.

1013
01:18:21,156 --> 01:18:25,446
- You could've done more with your life.
- You flatter me.

1014
01:18:25,577 --> 01:18:30,207
After the studio didn't want me,
I was lucky your father came along.

1015
01:18:30,332 --> 01:18:33,922
I was so used to having
someone look after me.

1016
01:18:34,044 --> 01:18:37,924
I would've killed myself
if it wasn't for him.

1017
01:18:38,048 --> 01:18:42,968
That's why it's so important
to marry a substantial man,

1018
01:18:43,094 --> 01:18:47,224
not some struggling left-wing artist
in Greenwich Village.

1019
01:18:47,349 --> 01:18:52,769
But then when Dad died, you drank
yourself to death with margaritas.

1020
01:18:52,896 --> 01:18:55,316
I couldn't help it, darling.

1021
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:00,360
You know I could never resist the taste
of salt around the rim of a glass.

1022
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,315
Oh, Mom.

1023
01:19:04,449 --> 01:19:06,489
You were so charming.

1024
01:19:07,244 --> 01:19:09,964
But so misguided.

1025
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:13,000
Why didn't I see it?

1026
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:18,094
When it came to me and your dad,
you had stars in your eyes.

1027
01:19:19,798 --> 01:19:22,468
Can't say the same for your sister.

(Joe) Well, it's Chambertin 1961.

1031
01:19:38,275 --> 01:19:41,645
Mm. You know so much
about wine, too.

1032
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:43,738
I know nothing.

1033
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:47,953
I ordered the most expensive one
and figured it must be the best.

1034
01:19:49,577 --> 01:19:53,287
These past few weeks
have been really fun for me.

1035
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:56,455
You were so relaxed this morning,
back at my place.

1036
01:19:56,584 --> 01:20:01,134
Very uninhibited.
Nothing sexier than a lapsed Catholic.

1037
01:20:01,256 --> 01:20:05,216
(Alice) Yeah. I have something
I wanna share with you.

1038
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:07,803
I must be drunk,
or I wouldn't be doing this.

1039
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:10,719
(Joe) Drugs?
Am I seeing correctly?

1040
01:20:10,849 --> 01:20:15,309
I gotta take these with water.
You can't take it with wine.

1041
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:20,977
These are not drugs. These are herbs.
They're very rare. You can't get any more.

1042
01:20:21,109 --> 01:20:24,569
- What kind of herbs?
- They make you invisible.

1043
01:20:24,696 --> 01:20:27,696
You're right.
You are a little drunk.

Oh, my God! I've got goose bumps

Come on. Have a sip.

1051

- What is this?
- Go on. I don't know. Just come on.

Take some.

01:21:04,944 --> 01:21:08,204
- What will it do? I'm a father.
- Look, trust me.

1054
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:20,964
- I don't feel any different.
- Wait a second.

- Just give it a minute.

- I can't... Where did you get this?

or something, just for fun?

How many times I wished for this!
Especially when I lived next to the YWCA.

01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,220
I ran into her the other day.
She was buying some classical records.

1090
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:35,142
He's a sax player. She turned beet red.

1091
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:40,481
It adds up, because Anny Phyfe said
she saw her with a man, not her husband,

1092
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:43,440
at the Whitney,
and she was blissful.

1093
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:47,821
I love these pants. Can you picture her
sleeping with another man?

1094
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:50,151
I'm sure all the lights are out.

1095
01:23:50,276 --> 01:23:53,736
It was bound to happen. Doug has been
such a run-around for years.

1096
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:57,243
You say that, but I don't know anyone
who's had an affair with him.

1097
01:23:57,367 --> 01:24:03,327
He's careful, but I've heard the stories.
He's a good-looking, rich, athletic man.

1098
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,746
You think he's gonna be satisfied
with Miss Mouse?

1099
01:24:06,876 --> 01:24:11,416
Actually, Jane, now that you mention it,
I think I do remember someone.

1100
01:24:11,548 --> 01:24:15,048
I hear he's always got
something going on the outside.

1101
01:24:17,053 --> 01:24:21,813
Excuse me. There's some heavy
breathing in the dressing room.

1102
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:40,244
I may be home late tomorrow. They're
throwing a Christmas party at the office.

1103
01:24:40,368 --> 01:24:43,198
- Shall I join?
- Oh, no, no.

1104
01:24:44,664 --> 01:24:48,214
It's not for wives.
You know, just the office crowd.

1105
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:52,839
You know, this January
we'll be married 16 years.

When you look around, I mean.

1108
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:04,561
Have you ever been unfaithful to me?

1109
01:25:06,686 --> 01:25:11,686
- What kind of a question is that?
- You know, every wife speculates.

1110
01:25:11,816 --> 01:25:15,066
- No.
- OK. It was just a casual question.

1111
01:25:16,112 --> 01:25:17,532
Have you?

1112
01:25:22,076 --> 01:25:24,576
- No.
- I was just kidding.

1113
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:36,050
Dorothy, I need some sisterly advice.

1114
01:25:36,174 --> 01:25:38,474
I think Doug is having an affair.

1115
01:25:38,593 --> 01:25:42,353
- Why?
- I overheard these people talking.

1116
01:25:42,472 --> 01:25:47,312
- Did they say he was?
- Yeah. And it might not be the first time.

1117
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:48,685
(Dorothy sighs)

1118
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:51,271
- (Dorothy) What do you think?
- I don't know.

1119
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:54,937
I asked him if he'd ever been unfaithful
and, of course, he denied it.

1120
01:25:55,068 --> 01:25:57,988
- (Dorothy) Of course.
- But I keep recalling these incidents.

1121
01:25:58,112 --> 01:26:00,662
(Dorothy) Look, if they make sense,
I would believe them.

1122
01:26:00,782 --> 01:26:04,162
(Alice) I've just been so trusting,
it never even occurred to me.

1123
01:26:04,285 --> 01:26:09,165
(Dorothy) There's a difference between
being trusting and wearing blinders.

1124
01:26:09,290 --> 01:26:13,540
Well, I suppose I don't really have
a right to complain,

1125
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,800
since I'm having an affair too.

1126
01:26:16,923 --> 01:26:19,053
- What?
- Yeah.

1127
01:26:19,175 --> 01:26:22,425
I better sit down.
This is really starting to get interesting.

1128
01:26:22,553 --> 01:26:25,473
He's a saxophone player,
and I like him a lot.

1129
01:26:25,598 --> 01:26:28,688
I've even had fantasies
of maybe leaving Doug for him.

1130
01:26:28,810 --> 01:26:30,850
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

1131
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:35,396
Well... Oh, Jesus.

1132
01:26:36,567 --> 01:26:38,987
Hey, Doug, come on.
The party's started on four.

1133
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:42,782
- Be right up. I have a little business.
- Let's go.

1134
01:26:44,659 --> 01:26:47,539
- Merry Christmas, Doug.
- Merry Christmas.

1135
01:26:52,792 --> 01:26:55,502
Did you see Howard's face
when you snubbed him?

1136
01:26:55,628 --> 01:26:58,458
- Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm. Crestfallen.

1137
01:26:59,757 --> 01:27:01,877
- How've you been?
- I've been excellent.

1138
01:27:02,009 --> 01:27:03,679
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1139
01:27:03,803 --> 01:27:07,353
- I saw you walk under the mistletoe.
- Too bad you weren't with me.

1140
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:09,523
I am with you.

1141
01:27:12,437 --> 01:27:15,397
- (Doug) Can you get away again Friday?
- This Friday?

1142
01:27:15,523 --> 01:27:19,993
I was going to tell Alice that the market
was in crisis and I had to work very late.

1143
01:27:20,111 --> 01:27:23,821
I have that board meeting again
on Friday. Philadelphia.

1144
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:29,501
- I don't know if I'll be back in time.
- Oh, come on. Try and make it.

1145
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:33,040
We can use Jay Teller's
apartment again.

1146
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:35,206
I still have such hot memories.

1147
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,924
- You're wicked.
- Yes.

1148
01:27:38,045 --> 01:27:40,085
Friday is perfect.

1149
01:27:41,716 --> 01:27:44,836
Are you wearing
that underwear I bought you?

1150
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:51,600
Oh, I keep having the feeling
that we're not alone.

1151
01:27:51,726 --> 01:27:55,306
We're alone, honey.
And no one will miss us.

1152
01:28:06,741 --> 01:28:08,791
(Screams) Oh, my...

1153
01:28:08,910 --> 01:28:11,750
Did you also have an affair
with Veronica Reynolds?

1154
01:28:11,871 --> 01:28:15,211
And Cynthia Scott, maybe?
They both look just like her.

1155
01:28:15,333 --> 01:28:19,053
- What are you doing here?
- The question is, why did you marry me?

1156
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:21,800
How did you get in here?
Alice? Alice?

1157
01:28:21,923 --> 01:28:26,053
Alice? Listen, Alice, this is nothing.
We both had a few drinks.

1158
01:28:26,177 --> 01:28:29,307
How did you get inside the office?
Alice?

1159
01:28:29,430 --> 01:28:31,060
Alice!

1160
01:28:31,182 --> 01:28:33,182
(♪ Soft piano music)

1161
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:37,654
Joe?

1162
01:28:55,122 --> 01:28:56,922
- Hi.
- Hi.

1163
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,751
OK, listen. Here's the thing.

1164
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:02,877
I'm leaving my husband.

1165
01:29:03,005 --> 01:29:06,125
It's been on my mind
for a long time.

1166
01:29:06,259 --> 01:29:10,139
Anyway, I've... I've really decided.

1167
01:29:11,097 --> 01:29:15,267
- So, I just thought you'd wanna know.
- Erm, Alice...

1168
01:29:16,394 --> 01:29:17,734
Yeah?

1169
01:29:18,855 --> 01:29:20,685
When you phoned...

1170
01:29:22,149 --> 01:29:26,699
...I was pacing up and down in front
of the mirror, rehearsing a speech.

1171
01:29:27,989 --> 01:29:30,369
Because I wanted to talk to you.

1172
01:29:30,491 --> 01:29:32,581
- Yes?
- The other day...

1173
01:29:33,953 --> 01:29:37,503
...you know, when we split up
on Madison Avenue,

1174
01:29:37,623 --> 01:29:39,793
after we both got invisible.

1175
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:43,337
'I guess I was a little drunk,
and I...

1176
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:47,592
'I did something
I've always wanted to do.

1177
01:29:47,717 --> 01:29:50,047
'I went to 96th Street.

1178
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:54,137
'And at four o'clock,
I entered the office of Dr Lerner,

1179
01:29:54,265 --> 01:29:56,725
'Vicki's psychoanalyst.

1180
01:29:56,851 --> 01:30:01,481
'Well, I listened to her private thoughts
for nearly an hour.

1181
01:30:02,857 --> 01:30:06,147
'And it turns out that, down deep...

1182
01:30:07,570 --> 01:30:09,700
'...she's still in love with me.

1183
01:30:10,948 --> 01:30:14,908
'And she regrets
having instigated our break.'

1184
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:17,995
The point I'm getting at is...

1185
01:30:20,833 --> 01:30:23,753
...I think I should take
that chance with her.

1186
01:30:24,795 --> 01:30:29,965
We were together for six years,
and we have a child whom we both love.

1187
01:30:33,846 --> 01:30:36,676
I don't know what else to say except...

1188
01:30:38,059 --> 01:30:43,229
...that, under everything,
I still care for her.

1189
01:30:48,778 --> 01:30:50,908
(Alice sighs)

1190
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:52,570
Well...

1191
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:57,368
Yes.

1192
01:30:58,955 --> 01:31:00,365
Well...

1193
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:20,349
(Dr Yang) Mrs Tait, come in.
Please excuse appearance.

1194
01:31:20,476 --> 01:31:23,686
- Dr Yang leaving.
- You're going away?

1195
01:31:23,813 --> 01:31:27,733
Yes. Must go to Tibet
for a period of time.

1196
01:31:27,858 --> 01:31:31,568
Ancient scrolls discovered.
New remedies.

1197
01:31:31,696 --> 01:31:35,566
Dr Yang must always
continue education.

1198
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:41,120
Good for my patients
and keeps Dr Yang young.

1199
01:31:41,914 --> 01:31:45,254
But tell Doctor, what is problem?

1200
01:31:45,376 --> 01:31:49,706
Well, I've experienced a double blow.

1201
01:31:49,839 --> 01:31:55,259
A husband who loved me once,
I know that he no longer does.

1202
01:31:55,386 --> 01:31:59,386
And a man I met recently
and developed strong feelings for

1203
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:02,345
now doesn't seem to want me.

1204
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:07,186
Love.
Love is most complex emotion.

1205
01:32:07,314 --> 01:32:10,324
Human beings unpredictable.

1206
01:32:10,443 --> 01:32:12,613
No logic to emotions.

1207
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:15,737
Where there is no logic,
there is no rational thought.

1208
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:19,945
Where there is no rational thought,
there can be much romance,

1209
01:32:20,077 --> 01:32:22,407
but much suffering.

1210
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:27,958
Gee, I... I feel like I'm adrift,
like I've been cut loose.

1211
01:32:28,085 --> 01:32:32,295
A while ago, I had a routine life,
with feelings I understood.

1212
01:32:32,423 --> 01:32:34,473
A husband, a home.

1213
01:32:34,592 --> 01:32:37,802
Mrs Tait had illusion of happiness.

1214
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:44,188
Upon closer observation, not very honest
husband, not very honest with self.

1215
01:32:44,310 --> 01:32:48,690
- I'm frightened.
- Freedom is frightening feeling.

1216
01:32:48,814 --> 01:32:51,114
Can you help me before you go?

1217
01:32:51,233 --> 01:32:53,283
Here, Mrs Tait.

1218
01:32:53,402 --> 01:32:56,322
Special herbs, very special herbs.

1219
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:59,157
Found only in Himalayas.

1220
01:32:59,283 --> 01:33:02,793
- What will these do?
- Is strong love potion.

1221
01:33:02,912 --> 01:33:08,292
Dissolve into drink. He who drinks
will lose heart to Mrs Tait.

1222
01:33:08,417 --> 01:33:11,707
So these will make Joe
love me again?

1223
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:14,967
Or your husband love you again
as he once did.

1224
01:33:15,091 --> 01:33:20,181
- Really?
- Herb is potent. Choice is yours.

1225
01:33:20,304 --> 01:33:22,474
Use wisely.

1226
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:24,598
Choice?

1227
01:33:24,725 --> 01:33:28,805
I think Mrs Tait has better idea
of who she is,

1228
01:33:28,938 --> 01:33:31,358
than before she came to Dr Yang.

1229
01:33:31,482 --> 01:33:34,442
Who her friends are, or are not.

1230
01:33:34,568 --> 01:33:39,158
Who is husband, lover,
sister, mother.

1231
01:33:39,281 --> 01:33:43,241
What are her needs,
her limits, her gifts.

1232
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:46,459
What are her innermost feelings.

1233
01:33:47,623 --> 01:33:53,133
May not know all answers,
but has better idea. No?

1234
01:33:54,213 --> 01:33:56,843
Yes. Yes, it's true.

1235
01:33:56,966 --> 01:34:01,296
Now must decide
which road her life will take.

1236
01:34:07,059 --> 01:34:08,979
Whoa! Sorry.

1237
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:13,521
Alice!
I didn't think you could make it.

1238
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:17,858
- Uh-oh. What's wrong?
- I'll come back.

1239
01:34:17,987 --> 01:34:21,987
(Dorothy) Don't be silly. Come in.
There are a lot of people you know here.

1240
01:34:23,284 --> 01:34:28,504
- Is that Alice? Hi. Where's Doug?
- He's busy.

1241
01:34:28,622 --> 01:34:32,422
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

1242
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:37,173
- I'm a little shaken up.
- I see that. Let's go into the kitchen.

1243
01:34:40,509 --> 01:34:42,799
What is it? What?

1244
01:34:44,013 --> 01:34:48,143
OK. I have to make a decision
between Doug and Joe.

1245
01:34:48,267 --> 01:34:50,387
Oh, God. Well...

1246
01:34:51,687 --> 01:34:54,517
- All right. What are your feelings?
- I don't know.

1247
01:34:54,648 --> 01:34:56,778
I have feelings for both of them.

1248
01:34:56,901 --> 01:34:59,611
Alice, is it that simple?
You just pick the one you want?

1249
01:34:59,737 --> 01:35:02,027
It's a long story,
but yes, yes, I can.

1250
01:35:02,156 --> 01:35:06,366
- You're the one to make this decision.
- Come on, you two. Join the party.

1251
01:35:06,493 --> 01:35:10,753
It's prime time.
People are gonna begin leaving soon.

1252
01:35:14,001 --> 01:35:16,751
That's great.
Look at these people go.

1253
01:35:16,879 --> 01:35:22,009
- We're not gonna have anything left.
- The party's a big hit. So's the eggnog.

1254
01:35:22,134 --> 01:35:25,054
Cocktail franks
and bicarbonate of soda.

1255
01:35:26,889 --> 01:35:31,229
What's, erm... what's with Alice?
She looked so upset when she came in.

1256
01:35:33,437 --> 01:35:37,317
- I'm gonna go get some more cake.
- Come on, tell me.

1257
01:35:37,441 --> 01:35:38,861
Dorothy?

1258
01:35:45,074 --> 01:35:47,494
Excuse me.
Alice? Could I have a word with you?

1259
01:35:47,618 --> 01:35:50,498
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Excuse us.

1260
01:35:51,497 --> 01:35:54,287
Thanks. He was getting
a little repetitious.

1261
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,246
What is this?

1262
01:35:56,377 --> 01:35:59,507
I'm so glad you and Dorothy
are seeing more of each other.

1263
01:35:59,630 --> 01:36:01,840
Thank you. I'm glad, too.

1264
01:36:01,966 --> 01:36:05,046
- I've always liked you.
- Thank you. I've always liked...

1265
01:36:05,177 --> 01:36:09,387
Have I got something there?
I'm glad you guys moved to New York.

1266
01:36:09,515 --> 01:36:12,135
No, I mean, I really like you.

1267
01:36:12,268 --> 01:36:15,228
Thank you. I really like you, too.

1268
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:18,484
- Now I know I made a mistake.
- What's that? A mistake?

1269
01:36:18,607 --> 01:36:23,777
Yeah. Marrying Dorothy. You're the one
I love. Always have, always will.

1270
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:26,744
What are you saying?
Are you kidding?

1271
01:36:27,825 --> 01:36:29,865
I don't know. Maybe I'm drunk.

1272
01:36:29,994 --> 01:36:34,254
Maybe you're drunk. I don't think
you should be saying things like that.

1273
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:37,043
- Oh, Alice, darling.
- Ken, come on!

1274
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:39,167
Come on, Ken.

1275
01:36:41,672 --> 01:36:45,552
Who's that?
Ah, it doesn't matter, anyway.

1276
01:36:49,179 --> 01:36:50,719
- Hello.
- Hello.

1277
01:36:50,848 --> 01:36:55,638
- We haven't met. I'm Sid Moscowitz.
- Excuse me. I'm Alice Tait.

1278
01:36:55,769 --> 01:37:00,729
You'll think I'm very forward, but you're
the loveliest creature I've ever seen.

1279
01:37:00,858 --> 01:37:03,068
Thank you.
That's very sweet. Thank you.

1280
01:37:03,193 --> 01:37:06,573
- Don't be offended.
- This is my night. I'm not at all offended.

1281
01:37:06,697 --> 01:37:09,987
- I've been staring at you for half an hour.
- Have you really?

1282
01:37:10,117 --> 01:37:12,577
- God!
- Excuse me. Hi, Sid. How are you?

1283
01:37:12,703 --> 01:37:16,213
- I'm fine.
- Everyone's having too much eggnog!

1284
01:37:16,332 --> 01:37:18,672
I want you to know I...

1285
01:37:18,792 --> 01:37:22,802
- You mean a lot to me.
- You don't even know me.

1286
01:37:22,921 --> 01:37:26,091
I know enough to know that
I would be lost without you.

1287
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:29,296
- You'd be lost without me?
- Suddenly, really...

1288
01:37:29,428 --> 01:37:33,518
- You're my world, Alice.
- I was just looking for my sister Dorothy.

1289
01:37:33,640 --> 01:37:35,730
- Excuse me...
- I need to say this.

1290
01:37:35,851 --> 01:37:38,231
- Who are you?
- My name is Alice Tait.

1291
01:37:38,354 --> 01:37:41,274
- Excuse me...
- Dorothy's sister. I was looking for her.

1292
01:37:41,398 --> 01:37:43,688
You are the most devastating woman...

1293
01:37:43,817 --> 01:37:46,697
- What is everyone on?
- Alice? I just I love you.

1294
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:48,910
- That's a beautiful name.
- Excuse me.

1295
01:37:49,031 --> 01:37:53,241
- The herbs. The herbs!
- (Both) Alice. Excuse me.

1296
01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:56,909
The herbs! A bag, did you see
a brown bag around here?

1297
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:01,419
- The nutmeg. I put that in the eggnog.
- Nutmeg? Oh, no. Isn't there any left?

1298
01:38:01,543 --> 01:38:05,463
- It was a small bag.
- It's not nutmeg. Get the eggnog, please.

1299
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:07,419
We have to tip the whole thing out.

1300
01:38:07,549 --> 01:38:11,349
- I'm Nat. I've been staring at you...
- There's been a mistake.

1301
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:14,640
- Give me that. Don't drink any more.
- You're so lovely.

1302
01:38:14,765 --> 01:38:17,725
- Ken, let me talk to you tomorrow.
- I love you.

1303
01:38:17,851 --> 01:38:22,481
Excuse me. You're gonna think this is
very sudden. I love you. Let's get married.

1304
01:38:22,606 --> 01:38:25,356
- I think we should. I have a lot of money.
- Alice. My God.

1305
01:38:25,484 --> 01:38:29,284
- There's been an accident.
- Joseph Banks. Can you feel it?

1306
01:38:29,405 --> 01:38:31,655
- Alice?
- Can you feel? Can you...?

1307
01:38:31,782 --> 01:38:35,912
Why don't you back off a second, OK?
Let me talk to her. Give me one second.

1308
01:38:36,036 --> 01:38:39,036
(♪ LIBERACE: "O Tannenbaum")

1309
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:04,401
- Claire had so much liposuction done.
- Yes?

1310
01:39:04,523 --> 01:39:08,033
I ran into her in Palm Beach
and again at the kinesiologist's.

1311
01:39:08,152 --> 01:39:12,532
I think she wants to have an affair
with her dog-walker.

1312
01:39:12,656 --> 01:39:15,696
- (Man) Taxi!
- Is it five or six Pekingese she has?

1313
01:39:15,826 --> 01:39:18,826
- (Woman 2) Six, I think. Is he cute?
- Mm... <i>Mezzo, mezzo.</i>

1314
01:39:28,505 --> 01:39:30,545
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

1315
01:39:30,674 --> 01:39:33,554
- We have to talk.
- Yeah, I think we do need to talk.

1316
01:39:33,677 --> 01:39:37,597
All right. I've fooled around a little
over the years. I'm not perfect.

1317
01:39:37,723 --> 01:39:40,523
- Neither am I.
- No, you are.

1318
01:39:40,642 --> 01:39:43,192
No, Doug. I've lied, I've cheated.

1319
01:39:43,312 --> 01:39:45,812
I've done things
I didn't think I had in me.

1320
01:39:45,939 --> 01:39:48,279
- You have?
- I have, I have.

1321
01:39:48,400 --> 01:39:51,280
We haven't had a real marriage
in so long, if ever.

1322
01:39:51,403 --> 01:39:53,323
In what way did you lie and cheat?

1323
01:39:53,447 --> 01:39:58,237
All I know is, I don't like the way I feel
about it. I think it's time to change that.

1324
01:39:58,368 --> 01:40:02,038
I don't wanna blow this out of proportion,
OK? What's past is past.

1325
01:40:02,164 --> 01:40:06,134
Nothing has to be different. We can
get things back to the way they were.

1326
01:40:06,251 --> 01:40:08,341
I know I can. I know I can.

1327
01:40:08,462 --> 01:40:11,922
- But I'm not going to.
- What does that mean?

1328
01:40:12,049 --> 01:40:15,389
Would you excuse us, please, Hilda?
Just for a moment, please.

1329
01:40:15,511 --> 01:40:18,061
I'll tell you what it means,
I'm tired of all this.

1330
01:40:18,180 --> 01:40:21,520
I'm tired of pedicures
and face-lifts,

1331
01:40:21,642 --> 01:40:25,152
and shopping and gossip
about who's in bed with who.

1332
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:28,650
- I'm tired of the whole thing.
- There's more than that. The children!

1333
01:40:28,774 --> 01:40:33,864
Yes, exactly. I want them growing up
with deeper values, with something else.

1334
01:40:33,987 --> 01:40:37,277
- Don't give me a lecture.
- That's something I don't need any more.

1335
01:40:37,407 --> 01:40:39,157
- What is it?
- For your own interest.

1336
01:40:39,284 --> 01:40:42,294
You wanted to take a writing course.
I said OK.

1337
01:40:42,412 --> 01:40:46,292
Did you also have an affair with
Nancy Brill? I wouldn't be surprised.

1338
01:40:46,416 --> 01:40:49,336
- I don't like you this way.
- I can't write.

1339
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:54,261
And if I could,
I'm incapable of more than a TV plot.

1340
01:40:54,383 --> 01:40:56,723
- We need to go to the Bahamas.
- It's pathetic.

1341
01:40:56,843 --> 01:41:01,563
- Unwind, sunbathe, unload this.
- I'm going further than the Bahamas.

1342
01:41:01,682 --> 01:41:05,062
- What? Where are you going?
- I'm going to Calcutta.

1343
01:41:05,185 --> 01:41:07,225
- You're going where?
- Calcutta.

1344
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:12,734
- To try and work with Mother Teresa.
- Do you have your ticket?

1345
01:41:12,859 --> 01:41:15,859
I want the children to have
a different kind of life.

1346
01:41:16,947 --> 01:41:20,237
- To know something different.
- Work Mother Teresa? Are you serious?

1347
01:41:20,367 --> 01:41:23,537
- I'm serious.
- You're serious about this?

1348
01:41:23,662 --> 01:41:27,542
- When did this amazing thought pop up?
- It doesn't matter when.

1349
01:41:27,666 --> 01:41:30,036
It does to me.

1350
01:41:30,168 --> 01:41:35,378
One minute without your charge plates
and masseuse and you would be lost!

1351
01:41:35,507 --> 01:41:38,587
Yeah, I know. You're probably right.

1352
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:43,929
- But it's not gonna be that way anymore.
- Really? What's it gonna be? Calcutta?

1353
01:41:44,057 --> 01:41:47,347
You're going off to Calcutta?

1354
01:41:47,477 --> 01:41:51,607
Do you know they have 10,000
unlisted diseases in Calcutta?

1355
01:41:53,734 --> 01:41:56,364
I don't believe...
What are you saying?

1356
01:41:58,363 --> 01:42:01,073
The second you see
an ad for a diamond earring,

1357
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:05,829
or get a craving for a caviar blini,
you'll be back, if indeed you go.

1358
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:08,374
You're not going with my children!

1359
01:42:21,553 --> 01:42:24,393
(Nina) 'Did you hear about Alice Tait?
She left her husband.'

(Sue) 'No!'
(Nina) 'That's old news.

1361
01:42:26,725 --> 01:42:30,055
- 'The big news is, she went to India.'
- 'Really?'

1362
01:42:30,187 --> 01:42:32,687
(Nina) 'It's incredible.
She met Mother Teresa!

1363
01:42:32,814 --> 01:42:36,404
'But now she's back, and I heard
she's doing some kind of volunteer work.'

1364
01:42:36,526 --> 01:42:39,196
(Sue) 'She always had
that Catholic streak.'

1365
01:42:39,321 --> 01:42:41,321
(Nina) 'She not only left her husband,

1366
01:42:41,448 --> 01:42:44,408
'she left her cook,
her chauffeur and her maid.

1367
01:42:44,534 --> 01:42:46,794
'And she's living downtown
just with the kids.

1368
01:42:46,912 --> 01:42:50,292
'You're not gonna believe this.
She does everything herself.

1369
01:42:50,415 --> 01:42:54,535
'Penny said she spends all her free time
with her kids, and she looks great.'

1370
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:57,880
(Sue) 'No cook or maid?
Did she have a mental breakdown?'

1371
01:42:58,006 --> 01:43:02,136
(Nina) 'That's my thought. But someone
said she's a changed woman.'

1372
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:05,560
(Sue) 'Speaking of changed women,
Gloria Phillips had face work.'

1373
01:43:05,681 --> 01:43:08,351
(Nina) 'She's having an affair
with her astrologer, isn't she?'

1374
01:43:08,475 --> 01:43:12,265
(Sue) 'But she's a changed woman,
because you can't tell it's Gloria.'
