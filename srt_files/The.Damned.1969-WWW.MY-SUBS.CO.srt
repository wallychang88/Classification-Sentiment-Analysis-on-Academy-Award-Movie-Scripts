1
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,453
- Janek!
- Here I am, Baron.

2
00:02:25,457 --> 00:02:26,685
Come on.

3
00:02:33,165 --> 00:02:34,598
Rub hard.

4
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,962
- Everybody here?
- No, Baron. Not everybody.

5
00:02:42,574 --> 00:02:44,064
Who's missing?

6
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:47,370
Mr. Bruckmann
and <i>Hauptsturmführer</i> Aschenbach...

7
00:02:47,446 --> 00:02:49,914
who still have to arrive from Oberhausen.

8
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,878
And the old man? Baron Joachim.

9
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:58,445
Come on, talk.

10
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:01,959
Baron Joachim is in his apartment.

11
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:05,685
He's getting dressed for dinner,
and so are the others.

12
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:17,271
- And my son?
- Can't you hear him?

13
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:30,351
Gunther.

14
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,391
- What do you want, Thilde?
- Come.

15
00:03:42,334 --> 00:03:43,665
Come.

16
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,565
What do you want?

17
00:03:47,339 --> 00:03:48,397
See.

18
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:52,310
Just like last year, Thilde.
No more, no less.

19
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,672
Yes, but last year
I was part of the audience.

20
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:57,113
Instead, this evening it will be different.

21
00:03:57,182 --> 00:04:01,380
- I hope I don't forget my part.
- It will be a grand debut.

22
00:04:01,453 --> 00:04:04,616
Tomorrow, your name
will be in all the newspapers.

23
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,792
All right. Thank you. All right.

24
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:01,045
A little compromise today and tomorrow...

25
00:05:01,113 --> 00:05:04,344
and one fine day
we won't even be able to find our chairs.

26
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:05,881
Yes, dear.

27
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:08,978
I'm almost ready.

28
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,655
You know how Uncle Joachim
insists on punctuality...

29
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:16,523
- especially this evening.
- Please, help me.

30
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,958
- Darling, stay still.
- Thank you, dear.

31
00:05:22,034 --> 00:05:25,492
You see, one can't always be saying "yes."
They're not reasonable people.

32
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,267
The more you give them to eat,
the more ravenous they become.

33
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,935
Darling, it's 40 years
that Uncle Joachim's been at the helm...

34
00:05:32,444 --> 00:05:35,140
and always with equilibrium and firmness.

35
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:37,944
Equilibrium. You've used the right word.

36
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:43,645
A favor to the Liberals,
one to the National Socialists.

37
00:05:43,722 --> 00:05:45,849
A favor to me, and one to Konstantin.

38
00:05:45,924 --> 00:05:50,258
Herbert, you're not being fair.
Joachim is certainly not soft with that...

39
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,093
- particular gentleman.
- Because he's a snob.

40
00:05:53,165 --> 00:05:56,032
If Hitler wasn't the son of a customs agent
and a servant...

41
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,626
Joachim would have already
thrown himself in his arms.

42
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:00,729
Yes, but you must admit
he took your advice...

43
00:06:00,806 --> 00:06:03,001
and didn't give a mark
to the National Socialists.

44
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:05,600
That's only because he's so miserly.

45
00:06:10,682 --> 00:06:14,550
- The children?
- You'll be hearing them soon enough.

46
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,588
They must be so nervous.

47
00:06:20,826 --> 00:06:23,920
- Come on, Herbert. Let's go, we're late.
- Thank you.

48
00:06:25,063 --> 00:06:26,826
- Come, darling.
- Yes.

49
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,727
<i>"Now I can feel</i>

50
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:32,326
<i>"now I can feel them in my little heart</i>

51
00:06:32,404 --> 00:06:36,204
<i>"But there are too many
and I can't repeat all of them</i>

52
00:06:36,275 --> 00:06:38,971
<i>"If you wish to read them</i>

53
00:06:39,044 --> 00:06:41,205
<i>"come closer</i>

54
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,249
<i>"Put your head on my breast
and listen carefully</i>

55
00:06:44,316 --> 00:06:46,375
<i>"listen carefully"</i>

56
00:06:52,724 --> 00:06:54,351
Happy birthday.

57
00:06:56,929 --> 00:06:59,159
Best wishes for your birthday.

58
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:03,791
Come here. I thank you.

59
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,270
I thank you, too, my little dear.

60
00:07:08,707 --> 00:07:11,005
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Janek.

61
00:07:31,063 --> 00:07:33,395
- Listen. Do you hear them?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:43,008 --> 00:07:46,637
Ever since she was born, she was told,
"You are the most intelligent...

63
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:50,739
"you're the richest, the most envied,
you're the Baroness von Essenbeck."

64
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:54,309
How can I ask her
just to become Mrs. Bruckmann?

65
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:58,888
The wife of an ordinary executive
of the steelworks which bear her name.

66
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:02,292
An ordinary executive
is not exactly the right term.

67
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,791
You have Uncle Joachim's confidence.

68
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,924
And Herbert and Konstantin
would never make a decision without you.

69
00:08:09,668 --> 00:08:12,694
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- Something.

70
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,069
But it's not enough for Sophie.

71
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:20,778
I've made a career for myself,
but I'll always be one of her employees.

72
00:08:22,014 --> 00:08:23,811
If we decided to get married tomorrow...

73
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:27,010
old Joachim would lose
that confidence and liking for me.

74
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,819
He likes to believe
that she's the inconsolable widow...

75
00:08:32,124 --> 00:08:34,422
of the adored son, the hero.

76
00:08:37,262 --> 00:08:38,251
Idiot!

77
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,322
He'd probably sack me on the spot,
you know, Wolfe.

78
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,527
No, Frederick, you're wrong.

79
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,501
Today, not even his 10,000 slaves
working in his mines and factories...

80
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:53,168
not even his money, his castles,
have enough power to put you out...

81
00:08:53,478 --> 00:08:55,605
because we have the power...

82
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:59,149
and we want you to remain where you are.

83
00:08:59,217 --> 00:09:02,209
If anything,
we want you to climb even higher.

84
00:09:06,158 --> 00:09:08,592
Over whom should I climb? Herbert?

85
00:09:09,895 --> 00:09:13,353
Though the fact that Herbert's
got to climb down is no news to anyone.

86
00:09:13,432 --> 00:09:17,459
His hostility towards
the National Socialists is too apparent.

87
00:09:19,371 --> 00:09:21,464
- But Konstantin--
- Konstantin?

88
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,338
Does he have that much effect on you?

89
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:28,242
Well, he's a member of the SA.

90
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,607
He has connections with Röhm.

91
00:09:30,682 --> 00:09:33,583
Our large industries will need men like you.

92
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:39,183
And our chancellor
has a weakness for big industrialists.

93
00:09:44,796 --> 00:09:48,960
In any case,
it wasn't Konstantin I had in mind.

94
00:09:54,406 --> 00:09:58,172
<i>"Can you feel?
Can you feel how much I love you?</i>

95
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:01,235
<i>"Then I don't have to write it down for you"</i>

96
00:10:06,985 --> 00:10:09,010
Do you think they would agree to an encore?

97
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:11,783
I think even more than one,
so don't risk asking for it.

98
00:10:11,857 --> 00:10:14,587
Then I will give up the idea.

99
00:10:16,128 --> 00:10:17,117
That was beautiful.

100
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:21,029
Wonderful, my dear. You were perfect, Thilde.

101
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:23,693
Come, sit down. Thank you so much.

102
00:10:23,768 --> 00:10:25,793
Thank you. Bravo.

103
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,039
Very good.

104
00:11:55,126 --> 00:11:57,856
You are the first to hold yourself back.

105
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,671
You seem to be ambitious,
but you're only a social climber.

106
00:12:11,743 --> 00:12:13,734
Sophie wouldn't be happy.

107
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,142
You worry too much
about Herbert and Konstantin.

108
00:12:19,217 --> 00:12:23,813
And you forget, there's somebody much
more important than they are: Joachim.

109
00:12:27,425 --> 00:12:31,486
You must realize that today, in Germany,
anything can happen...

110
00:12:31,563 --> 00:12:34,726
even the improbable,
and it's just the beginning.

111
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:36,662
"Personal morals are dead.

112
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:40,136
"We are an elite society
where everything is permissible."

113
00:12:40,338 --> 00:12:42,203
These are Hitler's words.

114
00:12:42,274 --> 00:12:45,903
My dear Frederick,
even you should give them some thought.

115
00:12:53,652 --> 00:12:56,678
Tonight, for example.

116
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:32,721
Wonderful, my dear. Perfectly good.

117
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,589
I've so enjoyed it. Thank you so much.

118
00:13:37,262 --> 00:13:41,596
I know it doesn't matter to you,
but your son is really talented.

119
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:46,533
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

120
00:13:52,344 --> 00:13:54,471
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

121
00:14:16,034 --> 00:14:17,831
I'm sorry. Telephone.

122
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:56,965
A little silence, please. Silence, please.

123
00:15:57,936 --> 00:16:00,666
In Berlin, the Reichstag is burning.

124
00:16:15,186 --> 00:16:17,211
Stop! Did you hear, stop it!

125
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,393
The fire started half an hour ago.
A conspiracy, no doubt.

126
00:16:23,928 --> 00:16:27,193
But I think
they've already arrested the guilty one.

127
00:16:27,499 --> 00:16:31,026
A Dutchman. A member of the Communist Party.

128
00:16:31,102 --> 00:16:32,763
Communist, of course!

129
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:37,667
A grave Communist crime
against the new government.

130
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:04,366
<i>Reich scum!</i>

131
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:21,875
They could've chosen another day
to burn the Reichstag.

132
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,979
Right, Grandfather?
They ruined your birthday.

133
00:17:39,871 --> 00:17:42,271
It was my headquarters in Berlin.

134
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:48,009
They still have not been able
to put out the fire.

135
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,547
The Berliners are on the terraces
enjoying the spectacle.

136
00:17:55,353 --> 00:17:57,082
Perhaps I shouldn't be here.

137
00:17:57,155 --> 00:17:59,783
The SA have been confined to their barracks.

138
00:18:01,659 --> 00:18:04,958
Keep calm, Konstantin.
The coup d'état has failed.

139
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:08,221
Whatever your battleground is,
it's not Berlin...

140
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:10,665
or at least it never has been until now.

141
00:18:10,735 --> 00:18:15,365
In any case, the fact that we've uncovered
the leaders of this conspiracy proves--

142
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,500
What conspiracy?
It's clear it's only a pretext.

143
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,901
That's far-fetched, Herbert.

144
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,675
Herbert's theories are always far-fetched.

145
00:18:29,253 --> 00:18:31,346
It's a deliberate provocation.

146
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:34,491
It can only be somebody
who's against the government.

147
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,528
If there is anyone who doesn't need
a parliament to govern us...

148
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:39,358
it's your chancellor.

149
00:18:40,264 --> 00:18:41,856
Herbert, please.

150
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,866
All Germany knows
there's a list of proscribed people.

151
00:18:47,939 --> 00:18:51,534
Now's the moment to get rid of
all opposition without trial and publicity...

152
00:18:51,609 --> 00:18:53,304
with all Europe looking on!

153
00:18:53,378 --> 00:18:56,006
The internal order of Germany
cannot interest Europe.

154
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,513
What internal order?

155
00:18:57,582 --> 00:19:00,483
The kind that allows his friends
to enter homes and kill?

156
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,348
Herbert, please.

157
00:19:04,355 --> 00:19:07,324
Didn't your Göring
promise the enemies of the Third Reich...

158
00:19:07,392 --> 00:19:11,488
- enough rope to hang themselves?
- You're losing your head, Herbert.

159
00:19:11,763 --> 00:19:16,029
Göring refers to the Communists.
Perhaps you're a Communist, too.

160
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,433
Today it's the Communists. And tomorrow?

161
00:19:19,837 --> 00:19:21,600
Don't worry about tomorrow.

162
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:24,239
At this very moment,
there's someone in Berlin...

163
00:19:24,308 --> 00:19:26,367
who's already doing the worrying.

164
00:19:26,544 --> 00:19:29,980
- Isn't that so?
- Well said, cousin Sophie.

165
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:35,217
Our only worry should be the
celebration of Uncle Joachim's birthday.

166
00:19:35,887 --> 00:19:38,981
Even if this is not a night
like all the others.

167
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:57,530
Happy Birthday

168
00:20:30,608 --> 00:20:32,405
For a long time...

169
00:20:33,111 --> 00:20:35,875
I have intended telling you...

170
00:20:36,881 --> 00:20:39,145
what I am now about to say.

171
00:20:41,986 --> 00:20:44,181
The dramatic events...

172
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:47,824
which occurred in these last few hours...

173
00:20:48,459 --> 00:20:51,553
force me to overcome any hesitation...

174
00:20:52,296 --> 00:20:54,127
and uncertainty...

175
00:20:55,099 --> 00:20:57,090
and go ahead.

176
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:00,237
In all these years...

177
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:05,166
you know that I have had only one object:

178
00:21:06,544 --> 00:21:11,072
To hold on to
the unity and prestige of our firm.

179
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:16,514
For that reason,
I always tried to adjust our work...

180
00:21:17,054 --> 00:21:19,648
and our structure...

181
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:22,852
according to the circumstances.

182
00:21:24,862 --> 00:21:28,821
During the Great War, during peace...

183
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:31,296
during...

184
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:33,296
crisis.

185
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,630
Now, in the face...

186
00:21:36,707 --> 00:21:39,904
of these recent dramatic events...

187
00:21:40,244 --> 00:21:41,768
I maintain...

188
00:21:41,846 --> 00:21:45,612
that it is more than ever necessary...

189
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:49,543
to protect the Essenbeck Steelworks...

190
00:21:49,921 --> 00:21:53,288
from eventual political pressures...

191
00:21:54,425 --> 00:21:55,790
or from...

192
00:21:57,028 --> 00:22:00,122
even greater risks.

193
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:07,229
You must admit
that I never yielded to this regime.

194
00:22:07,939 --> 00:22:11,534
And everybody knows I never had...

195
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:17,544
and never will have a rapport
with that... gentleman.

196
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:25,722
Nevertheless, in the interests
of the factory...

197
00:22:27,925 --> 00:22:30,655
our production activity...

198
00:22:31,495 --> 00:22:35,556
compels us to keep in daily contact...

199
00:22:35,633 --> 00:22:38,067
with these people.

200
00:22:40,605 --> 00:22:43,472
This is why I feel an indispensable need...

201
00:22:43,541 --> 00:22:45,771
to have at my side a man...

202
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:48,878
in favor of the regime...

203
00:22:49,413 --> 00:22:51,881
- who can guarantee us--
- All right.

204
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:55,009
My resignation
has been ready for some time, Joachim...

205
00:22:55,086 --> 00:22:57,316
if this is what you're asking.

206
00:22:57,755 --> 00:23:00,451
I am forced to do it, Herbert...

207
00:23:00,725 --> 00:23:04,320
against my will
and without strong conviction.

208
00:23:04,996 --> 00:23:07,521
- But the steelworks--
- Yes.

209
00:23:07,598 --> 00:23:10,226
Right or wrong, they must always come first.

210
00:23:10,334 --> 00:23:12,131
That has always been your creed.

211
00:23:12,203 --> 00:23:14,694
You sent your son to the slaughter,
so you could say:

212
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:18,640
"The Essenbecks put children and cannons
into the world with the same sentiment."

213
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:21,735
And with the same sentiment
they'll be buried.

214
00:23:24,849 --> 00:23:26,180
Forgive me.

215
00:23:29,887 --> 00:23:32,117
I congratulate you, Konstantin.

216
00:23:32,323 --> 00:23:34,883
You'll be the vice president that we deserve.

217
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,195
Come, Herbert. Please.

218
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:54,476
I hope I don't follow in the footsteps...

219
00:23:54,845 --> 00:23:56,506
of my predecessor.

220
00:23:58,215 --> 00:23:59,876
Agreed, Frederick?

221
00:24:03,087 --> 00:24:06,386
<i>"Children, the young ones
are coming out of my ears</i>

222
00:24:07,291 --> 00:24:10,692
<i>"A man, a real man</i>

223
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:14,395
<i>"Children, the young ones
are coming out of my ears</i>

224
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,633
<i>"A man, a real man"</i>

225
00:24:20,504 --> 00:24:24,668
If it suited him, Aschenbach
would stab me in the back. I know that.

226
00:24:25,443 --> 00:24:28,935
But not this time. He's on my side.

227
00:24:30,081 --> 00:24:31,810
On our side, Sophie.

228
00:24:33,050 --> 00:24:34,677
Herbert was right.

229
00:24:35,486 --> 00:24:38,978
They did set the Reichstag on fire.
Coming here in the car tonight...

230
00:24:39,056 --> 00:24:43,925
Aschenbach was perfectly clear in his own
mind that it was going to be successful.

231
00:24:45,463 --> 00:24:49,991
We talked about you and about me,
about Joachim, about the steelworks.

232
00:24:51,969 --> 00:24:54,028
And underneath all that...

233
00:24:56,607 --> 00:24:58,199
he was saying:

234
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:02,436
"Tonight, you will be
given a special opportunity.

235
00:25:02,513 --> 00:25:05,778
"It's up to you to decide
whether to take it or not.

236
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:10,112
"Whether to be with us or against us."

237
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:12,812
You understand what that means, Sophie?

238
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:24,293
I can't believe they'd put Joachim's name
on the proscription list.

239
00:25:24,368 --> 00:25:27,132
He's much too important to the steelworks.

240
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:31,338
For Herbert, perhaps, it's probably over.

241
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,008
Strange things will happen tonight, probably.

242
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,148
And the only losers will be the onlookers.

243
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:42,151
I feel as if I've been given
a special mission.

244
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:48,086
And if I accept it, if I take that chance...

245
00:25:49,827 --> 00:25:52,125
they'll give me all their help.

246
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:55,698
And there won't any more be a Herbert...

247
00:25:55,766 --> 00:25:58,064
or a Konstantin, or a Joachim.

248
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,001
I will be in command.

249
00:26:02,106 --> 00:26:05,974
I will make decisions. You and I, Sophie.

250
00:26:14,418 --> 00:26:16,318
What have you decided?

251
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:23,621
It would be the first decision I'd taken...

252
00:26:24,195 --> 00:26:25,958
without consulting you.

253
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,021
You did well, Frederick...

254
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,294
even if I will never know
how to push you enough.

255
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,368
Go, and go to the limit.

256
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:42,604
None of them are worth
even half of what you are.

257
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,080
You did well to wait,
or to say yes, to thank them.

258
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,344
But now you must make it pay!

259
00:26:47,651 --> 00:26:50,347
All the times
that Herbert tried to push you aside...

260
00:26:50,421 --> 00:26:52,685
that Joachim looked down on you...

261
00:26:52,756 --> 00:26:56,419
and Konstantin, with his protective air,
always trying to help you...

262
00:26:56,494 --> 00:26:59,395
to offer you a hand. He's the worst of all.

263
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,901
Don't be afraid, Frederick.

264
00:27:07,371 --> 00:27:08,895
I'm not afraid.

265
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:15,404
All we have to do now
is to convince your son...

266
00:27:16,914 --> 00:27:21,044
- that I can do the job.
- I'll take care of Martin.

267
00:27:23,621 --> 00:27:25,953
I know Martin's desires.

268
00:27:36,734 --> 00:27:38,793
He has no sense of values.

269
00:27:40,004 --> 00:27:44,532
The steelworks or a Rolls,
it's all the same to him.

270
00:27:46,777 --> 00:27:49,678
We will throw him the bait. Leave it to me.

271
00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:57,587
- I've won!
- Yes, you've won.

272
00:27:57,655 --> 00:27:59,486
- Where's Erika?
- Erika, come!

273
00:27:59,557 --> 00:28:03,584
- I've won, you can come out now.
- Erika! Where are you?

274
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:10,166
- Here I am.
- There you are, you naughty little thing.

275
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:13,829
Come here. Now it's your turn. Come.

276
00:28:19,677 --> 00:28:22,043
Put your hands over your eyes. Like that.

277
00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:24,804
Now count up to 100, out loud.

278
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,977
One, two, three...

279
00:28:29,253 --> 00:28:31,414
four, five, six...

280
00:28:31,789 --> 00:28:33,882
seven, eight, nine...

281
00:28:33,958 --> 00:28:36,426
ten, eleven, twelve...

282
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:38,393
thirteen, fourteen...

283
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:01,974
Erika. Come!

284
00:29:11,395 --> 00:29:15,832
Drink! Let's not talk any more. Drink!

285
00:29:17,334 --> 00:29:21,327
- I will not leave my school.
- You'll leave that dirty hole!

286
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,639
You'll come with me to the factory.

287
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:28,300
I'll drag you if necessary.

288
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:34,083
But I swear, in 10 years,
you will be in a position of command.

289
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:37,713
In a position to even throw me out.

290
00:29:38,322 --> 00:29:42,224
At the cost of breaking
that damn cello over your head.

291
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:48,693
You're getting to be like your mother.
The same delicate stomach!

292
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:53,535
Never wanted to put her foot
inside the factory.

293
00:29:57,241 --> 00:30:01,371
The heat of the ovens made her giddy.

294
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:07,681
- Listen, Papa, I have decided--
- I'll decide for you.

295
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,324
I know. You can't bear me.

296
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:22,565
But even I don't ask that you love me.

297
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,061
On the contrary.

298
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:29,034
I don't intend to leave that seat...

299
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:33,838
to that eager Frederick, neither to Martin.

300
00:30:34,845 --> 00:30:36,608
I'll tie you to it...

301
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:41,508
when your time comes,
and God help me if I don't.

302
00:30:43,487 --> 00:30:46,217
Those bastards have poisoned your mind.

303
00:30:46,623 --> 00:30:49,990
But we'll tear
that school of yours to pieces...

304
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:53,828
including all their bloody damned books!

305
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:57,194
Gunther!

306
00:31:07,111 --> 00:31:11,207
- Erika.
- Do you want her to find us quickly?

307
00:31:33,704 --> 00:31:34,864
Come in.

308
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:46,510
Come in.

309
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,616
All right.

310
00:31:53,056 --> 00:31:54,455
As I foresaw.

311
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:57,483
Before daybreak, Herbert will be arrested.

312
00:32:03,033 --> 00:32:06,730
Poor Herbert! And to think
that we're so close to the border.

313
00:32:10,974 --> 00:32:14,171
Will there be a trial?
Is there a specific charge?

314
00:32:17,347 --> 00:32:20,407
I don't believe
such formalities are necessary.

315
00:32:21,118 --> 00:32:24,144
We just have to be careful
of their substance...

316
00:32:27,858 --> 00:32:30,019
and the substance is this:

317
00:32:33,363 --> 00:32:36,457
Before the flames of the Reichstag
are put out...

318
00:32:37,768 --> 00:32:40,862
the men of old Germany
will be reduced to ashes.

319
00:32:47,277 --> 00:32:50,838
Nevertheless, a semblance of legality...

320
00:32:51,949 --> 00:32:55,407
can also be useful sometimes.

321
00:32:57,654 --> 00:33:01,112
But now you must excuse me.
I'm tired and would like to retire.

322
00:33:11,835 --> 00:33:13,359
If you need me.

323
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:29,778
But to leave like this, like thieves.

324
00:33:30,587 --> 00:33:33,055
We are not the only ones, Elizabeth.

325
00:33:33,123 --> 00:33:37,856
Every day there are a lot of people who
have to leave for other parts of Europe.

326
00:33:37,928 --> 00:33:41,659
We are among the more fortunate.
At least we know where we're going.

327
00:33:41,765 --> 00:33:44,427
- We have friends.
- But when?

328
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,739
The time it takes to get ready
and hand over the office at the factory.

329
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:57,145
It's all over, Gunther.

330
00:34:00,517 --> 00:34:03,850
It was our fault. Everyone's, even mine.

331
00:34:04,187 --> 00:34:06,781
It does no good to raise your voice
when it's too late...

332
00:34:06,857 --> 00:34:08,950
not even to save your soul.

333
00:34:09,026 --> 00:34:12,291
All we have done
is give Germany a sick democracy.

334
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:14,654
The fear of a proletarian revolution...

335
00:34:14,731 --> 00:34:17,700
which would have thrown the country
to the Left was too great...

336
00:34:17,768 --> 00:34:22,603
and now we can't defend it any longer.
Nazism, Gunther, is our creation.

337
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,498
It was born in our factories,
nourished with our money.

338
00:34:27,344 --> 00:34:30,905
I know what you're thinking:
that I shouldn't run away...

339
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:35,279
- and perhaps you're hating me for it.
- No, Uncle Herbert.

340
00:34:39,723 --> 00:34:42,886
- We'll keep in contact, won't we?
- Yes.

341
00:34:44,595 --> 00:34:47,086
It's so late. What are you doing?

342
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:50,027
- Where's Thilde? Do you know, Erika?
- I don't know.

343
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:52,763
Thilde!

344
00:36:03,907 --> 00:36:05,807
Herbert, they're here.

345
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:08,674
They've come to take you.
You haven't a moment to lose.

346
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:11,407
- Elizabeth.
- No!

347
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:13,949
Herbert, you haven't got
a moment to lose. Hurry!

348
00:36:14,017 --> 00:36:15,848
- Don't go.
- Hurry!

349
00:36:45,148 --> 00:36:47,082
- You're mad to take that. Give it to me.
- No!

350
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,744
I'll get rid of it for you. Now hurry.

351
00:36:55,325 --> 00:36:57,384
Herbert! Darling, quickly.

352
00:37:00,297 --> 00:37:03,528
- Take care of the children.
- Go, my love.

353
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,795
Herbert, don't. This way.

354
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:24,178
Open!

355
00:37:48,612 --> 00:37:50,637
You, too, recognize this weapon?

356
00:37:52,349 --> 00:37:53,407
Yes.

357
00:37:54,584 --> 00:37:58,020
The weapon apparently
belongs to Mr. Herbert Thallman.

358
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,381
Should we continue with our investigation?

359
00:38:30,253 --> 00:38:32,983
Let's leave it to the legal authorities.

360
00:38:35,258 --> 00:38:37,954
Mr. Thallman has taken a file
of compromising documents...

361
00:38:38,028 --> 00:38:41,464
concerning the most recent research
in the steelworks.

362
00:38:41,898 --> 00:38:44,696
It could be very useful outside the Reich.

363
00:38:46,002 --> 00:38:48,630
He cannot make any concrete use of it.

364
00:39:07,357 --> 00:39:09,484
"To the prosecuting attorney.

365
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:14,222
"February 18, 1933.

366
00:39:16,466 --> 00:39:17,694
"Subject:

367
00:39:18,935 --> 00:39:22,564
"The incrimination
of Herbert Thallman, fugitive...

368
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:26,334
"for the first-degree murder...

369
00:39:26,743 --> 00:39:30,235
"of Baron Joachim von Essenbeck."

370
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:59,574
I know what you are feeling, my dear Martin.

371
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,910
But you can't, from one day to another...

372
00:40:08,952 --> 00:40:12,888
assume such a big responsibility...

373
00:40:12,956 --> 00:40:15,618
without feeling, let's say...

374
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,088
afraid.

375
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:22,598
But neither I nor Frederick
will leave you alone.

376
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:24,723
We say, however...

377
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:28,259
that you have all the time
to continue your studies...

378
00:40:29,272 --> 00:40:33,470
and to take in hand the problems of the firm.

379
00:40:36,112 --> 00:40:38,979
They aren't small problems, believe me.

380
00:40:40,317 --> 00:40:44,777
Meanwhile, Frederick and I
will keep the business going...

381
00:40:45,322 --> 00:40:48,052
as we have always done in the past.

382
00:40:49,025 --> 00:40:53,018
I had really hoped
that you wouldn't have to assume...

383
00:40:53,396 --> 00:40:55,887
the presidency of the steelworks...

384
00:40:56,266 --> 00:41:00,430
under such tragic circumstances.

385
00:41:04,407 --> 00:41:06,170
But unfortunately...

386
00:41:06,676 --> 00:41:10,305
I still wanted to say that...

387
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:15,648
Grandfather was right.

388
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:20,014
In these times, our plant...

389
00:41:20,724 --> 00:41:23,158
Yes, after all...

390
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,831
either it is in agreement
with the government...

391
00:41:29,899 --> 00:41:32,891
or else our business, our advantages...

392
00:41:39,943 --> 00:41:42,969
I don't pretend to be a businessman,
not even a politician.

393
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:45,476
However, this I know, too...

394
00:41:47,183 --> 00:41:50,482
it's a matter of fact of special production.

395
00:41:51,454 --> 00:41:53,820
There are technical problems.

396
00:41:56,526 --> 00:41:57,618
Good.

397
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:00,660
Very good.

398
00:42:01,297 --> 00:42:03,925
You've even made a crowning speech.

399
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:09,200
Now, however, don't exaggerate.

400
00:42:10,607 --> 00:42:13,007
Let's try to give this meeting...

401
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:17,945
a rather more familiar tone?

402
00:42:21,217 --> 00:42:24,209
- Joachim's intentions--
- I beg you, Konstantin!

403
00:42:25,588 --> 00:42:29,080
Martin has not finished.
He's still saying something.

404
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,626
Let's listen.

405
00:42:32,262 --> 00:42:36,062
Uncle Konstantin,
I will respect all of Grandfather's will.

406
00:42:40,804 --> 00:42:45,138
He has nominated you vice president,
and it's fair that it should be so.

407
00:42:48,278 --> 00:42:51,076
But I think that in a moment like this...

408
00:42:51,681 --> 00:42:55,378
I think, yes, in a moment like this,
the presidency...

409
00:42:55,752 --> 00:42:58,846
above all, needs a technician.

410
00:43:04,127 --> 00:43:06,288
What kind of a joke is this?

411
00:43:06,362 --> 00:43:09,593
It's not a joke.
Enormous interests are at stake.

412
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:15,199
And Martin thinks...

413
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,909
As far as I know, it's the first time...

414
00:43:20,276 --> 00:43:22,972
Martin ever used his head to think.

415
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:26,573
I inherit the major stock,
and it's up to me to decide.

416
00:43:27,016 --> 00:43:28,813
It is up to me to decide!

417
00:43:36,059 --> 00:43:39,051
I nominate Frederick Bruckmann...

418
00:43:39,696 --> 00:43:41,823
president of the administration...

419
00:43:41,898 --> 00:43:45,163
and general director
of the Essenbeck Steelworks...

420
00:43:45,902 --> 00:43:49,497
and all its associated member groups.

421
00:43:55,612 --> 00:43:57,477
Frederick Bruckmann.

422
00:43:58,047 --> 00:44:03,007
I pulled you up like this
from the nothing that you were.

423
00:44:04,621 --> 00:44:06,316
Herbert's pistol...

424
00:44:06,823 --> 00:44:10,725
Aschenbach's testimony,
the arrival of the SS.

425
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:17,259
Too much fantasy, Konstantin.

426
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:21,129
You come with me.

427
00:44:22,372 --> 00:44:24,863
Today, you, too, learned something.

428
00:44:25,341 --> 00:44:28,504
Things you are not taught
in a school like yours.

429
00:44:29,445 --> 00:44:30,537
Come.

430
00:44:40,924 --> 00:44:42,915
Don't have any illusions.

431
00:44:43,927 --> 00:44:45,895
This war has just begun.

432
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:50,265
Gunther, come!

433
00:48:13,169 --> 00:48:17,629
To the first model, with the hope
that we will quickly hear its music.

434
00:48:29,886 --> 00:48:32,684
Will this entertainment last much longer?

435
00:48:33,756 --> 00:48:37,123
Your place is here, Martin.
You can't leave now.

436
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:38,792
All right, sir.

437
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:45,567
Mr. Bruckmann.

438
00:48:48,237 --> 00:48:50,000
I don't understand...

439
00:48:50,072 --> 00:48:53,564
I knew your father
at the French Front in 1916.

440
00:48:54,477 --> 00:48:58,106
A true Essenbeck, and a heroic officer.

441
00:48:58,748 --> 00:48:59,806
I know.

442
00:48:59,882 --> 00:49:03,909
The General Staff is quite firm
on this point. Either Röhm goes or we go.

443
00:49:03,986 --> 00:49:05,783
It's naked extortion.

444
00:49:06,322 --> 00:49:10,383
The SA is a knife at the throat
of the high finance and the <i>Reichswehr</i>.

445
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:13,429
Consequently, it'll be necessary
to stop the flow...

446
00:49:13,496 --> 00:49:16,659
of the heavy artillery
into the barracks of the SA.

447
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,561
Is that your personal opinion?

448
00:49:20,636 --> 00:49:23,127
It is the opinion of the general staff.

449
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:27,936
And also of the Chancellor,
if you don't mind my saying so.

450
00:49:28,277 --> 00:49:31,371
The army is the army, and the SA is the SA.

451
00:49:31,781 --> 00:49:34,409
We are not concerned with internal order.

452
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:38,179
And we will not divide
our traditional duties with others.

453
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:40,116
Traditional duties?

454
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:44,187
I'd like to know
where the Prussian generals were...

455
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,457
when we cleaned up Germany
from top to bottom!

456
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:50,897
- This country will never be clean enough--
- I beg your pardon.

457
00:49:51,734 --> 00:49:53,133
Gentlemen.

458
00:49:54,837 --> 00:49:58,329
No one doubts the merits
of the attack formations, dear cousin.

459
00:49:59,442 --> 00:50:03,071
We ourselves would not be here
without the work of the SA.

460
00:50:03,713 --> 00:50:06,876
But heavy arms are not needed
for public order.

461
00:50:08,351 --> 00:50:10,649
All you have to do is look around.

462
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,178
Germany is the most orderly country
in the whole world.

463
00:50:14,457 --> 00:50:17,893
It's a pleasure
for the American and English tourists.

464
00:50:19,128 --> 00:50:20,993
What more do you want?

465
00:50:22,832 --> 00:50:25,426
And so, gentlemen, we're all agreed.

466
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,561
Not one single machine gun
leaves this place...

467
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:32,406
unless it is requested by the general staff.

468
00:50:49,091 --> 00:50:51,821
We are close to the elections, Frederick...

469
00:50:52,128 --> 00:50:55,859
and we must win them at all costs
if we want them to be the last.

470
00:50:55,932 --> 00:50:58,366
But you know that takes a lot of money.

471
00:50:58,668 --> 00:51:00,397
Essenbeck is late.

472
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:06,069
Joachim's stubborn hostility has created
this disagreeable state of affairs.

473
00:51:06,208 --> 00:51:08,540
All the other industrialists
have paid their quota--

474
00:51:08,611 --> 00:51:12,638
Excuse me. It is difficult to set aside
such a large sum of money...

475
00:51:12,715 --> 00:51:15,240
without juggling the balance sheets.

476
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:18,053
This is a corporation...

477
00:51:18,955 --> 00:51:22,857
and as you well know,
Konstantin can be a problem.

478
00:51:25,261 --> 00:51:27,422
If Konstantin wants to become a problem...

479
00:51:27,496 --> 00:51:31,865
well then, I say that a problem
always can be resolved.

480
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:35,036
Don't you think so?

481
00:51:35,371 --> 00:51:38,238
"The state cannot but crush
the innocent little flower...

482
00:51:38,307 --> 00:51:41,640
- "if the flower obstructs its path."
- I am not the state.

483
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:46,180
I've done everything I was required to do,
and I will involve myself no further.

484
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:47,647
Come on now!

485
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:50,815
Don't take me up on every word.

486
00:51:51,787 --> 00:51:54,813
They are words of Hegel, you know.

487
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,691
He'd turn over in his grave...

488
00:51:58,761 --> 00:52:02,458
at the idea of Konstantin being
compared to his innocent little flower.

489
00:52:03,466 --> 00:52:06,458
Don't you think I could go? It's late.

490
00:52:07,803 --> 00:52:09,395
Yes, go, Martin.

491
00:52:09,939 --> 00:52:11,930
Thank you. Goodbye.

492
00:52:16,879 --> 00:52:20,212
You will answer for everything
that may happen here.

493
00:52:21,283 --> 00:52:22,807
Remember that.

494
00:52:26,122 --> 00:52:30,957
ESSENBECK CAST-STEEL FACTORY H. ESSENBECK

495
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:04,523
<i>Emmer Street, please. Drive quickly.</i>

496
00:53:57,012 --> 00:54:00,470
- She's not here now. She's gone out.
- Thank you, I know.

497
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:05,331
Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Walter Rathenau...

498
00:56:10,379 --> 00:56:13,075
Erich Maria Remarque...

499
00:56:14,383 --> 00:56:17,443
Arnold and Stefan Zweig...

500
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:20,978
André Gide...

501
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,016
Helen Keller...

502
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:26,722
Margaret Sanger...

503
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,188
Jack London...

504
00:56:30,266 --> 00:56:32,291
George Bernard Shaw...

505
00:56:33,936 --> 00:56:35,494
Émile Zola...

506
00:56:37,339 --> 00:56:38,863
Marcel Proust.

507
00:57:45,674 --> 00:57:47,039
Come here.

508
00:57:51,981 --> 00:57:54,176
I had to open it. I'm sorry.

509
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:03,013
I'm obliged to read the mail,
specially foreign correspondence.

510
00:58:03,492 --> 00:58:07,326
Herbert Thallman is my uncle.
It's absurd that I can't receive--

511
00:58:07,396 --> 00:58:09,364
Listen to me, von Essenbeck.

512
00:58:09,431 --> 00:58:12,730
If your uncle had good sense,
he wouldn't write to you here.

513
00:58:12,801 --> 00:58:16,669
Where would you like him to write to me?
He needs help.

514
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:20,538
- You read that yourself, didn't you?
- I don't want to know anything.

515
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:22,940
I don't want to be involved in it.

516
00:58:23,012 --> 00:58:27,108
I only want you not to drag our institute
in this mess.

517
00:58:28,851 --> 00:58:31,285
And then, I can't believe...

518
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:35,254
I refuse to believe what your uncle writes.

519
00:58:38,794 --> 00:58:41,160
- I ask permission to leave.
- Go.

520
00:58:42,865 --> 00:58:45,891
And get your hair cut, von Essenbeck.

521
00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:48,731
Yes, sir.

522
00:58:57,346 --> 00:58:58,813
Yes, I believe that's all of it.

523
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:03,113
Request for renewal, tax deposit, stamps.

524
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:06,849
- Reason for the trip?
- Vacation.

525
00:59:07,489 --> 00:59:11,118
Vacation. Going alone, Mrs. Thallman?

526
00:59:11,593 --> 00:59:13,220
With my children.

527
00:59:14,596 --> 00:59:17,895
Thilde, age eleven. Erika, eight.
Is that correct?

528
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,758
Yes.

529
00:59:21,804 --> 00:59:24,295
Do you intend joining your husband?

530
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:26,164
No.

531
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,700
Perhaps you don't know where he is.

532
00:59:30,512 --> 00:59:32,639
We are always well-informed, you know.

533
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:35,911
I can't see the difficulty.
We only wish to leave.

534
00:59:36,151 --> 00:59:38,847
Has someone caused you some difficulty?

535
00:59:39,988 --> 00:59:41,649
No, not exactly.

536
00:59:49,331 --> 00:59:52,232
Do you know that your husband
has committed murder?

537
00:59:52,301 --> 00:59:54,030
That's absurd. A disgrace.

538
00:59:54,103 --> 00:59:56,833
Are you sure? Then why don't you
convince him to come back?

539
00:59:56,905 --> 00:59:59,738
- He could prove his innocence.
- But I don't know where he is.

540
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:02,174
What have the children or I
got to do with it?

541
01:00:02,244 --> 01:00:05,042
Is there some charge, perhaps, against us?

542
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:08,514
We don't want to leave, just to get away.

543
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:22,991
- Is someone forcing you to leave?
- No, they're stopping me.

544
01:00:24,199 --> 01:00:26,258
Who's stopping you, Mrs...

545
01:00:26,568 --> 01:00:28,866
Thallman. Elizabeth Thallman.

546
01:00:29,171 --> 01:00:31,401
Perhaps you mean to insinuate.

547
01:00:31,840 --> 01:00:35,276
Answer. Don't be afraid. Answer.

548
01:00:37,546 --> 01:00:40,071
- Good morning.
- Your friend is not at home.

549
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:41,912
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

550
01:00:41,984 --> 01:00:44,248
She had to go out.
She said she would be back late.

551
01:00:44,319 --> 01:00:45,684
All right.

552
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:48,408
Lisa.

553
01:01:50,786 --> 01:01:53,619
Look what I've brought you.
Do you like this little horse?

554
01:01:53,689 --> 01:01:57,056
- Yes, thank you.
- You can ride on it. Do you like it?

555
01:01:58,393 --> 01:02:01,294
You can caress it. Try it, Lisa.

556
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:04,426
- It's all yours. Do you like it?
- Yes.

557
01:02:05,334 --> 01:02:07,359
You must take care of him.

558
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:11,466
You know, he likes you very much.
He really does.

559
01:03:01,056 --> 01:03:02,216
Lisa!

560
01:03:10,999 --> 01:03:13,433
Lisa, why don't you answer me?

561
01:03:37,592 --> 01:03:39,958
- You're a wicked girl, Lisa.
- No!

562
01:03:42,998 --> 01:03:46,934
What do you think you're doing?
I've told you not to waste time.

563
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:49,034
You never do any work.

564
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:56,104
You stay here and play all day.
Look at the disorder in here.

565
01:03:57,245 --> 01:04:00,703
Stop crying, or I'll really give you
something to cry about.

566
01:04:03,018 --> 01:04:05,851
I told you to stop. Didn't you hear me?

567
01:04:07,155 --> 01:04:09,248
Start cleaning up the room.

568
01:04:10,726 --> 01:04:12,853
And the plates need washing.

569
01:04:13,128 --> 01:04:16,325
Come on now. Get to work!

570
01:05:13,188 --> 01:05:14,416
Martin.

571
01:05:19,394 --> 01:05:20,588
It's you.

572
01:05:20,662 --> 01:05:23,961
- I didn't expect to find you here.
- What's the time?

573
01:05:24,866 --> 01:05:27,733
- It's 2:00.
- 2:00.

574
01:05:28,670 --> 01:05:31,764
It's so late.
I had a lot of work to do tonight.

575
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:43,042
Help me, I implore you. Help me.

576
01:05:48,457 --> 01:05:51,984
I know you're the strongest,
and you can prevent me from going.

577
01:05:52,060 --> 01:05:54,460
But I don't see what's the point.

578
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:57,590
You can't still be afraid of Herbert.

579
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:02,469
Yes, before maybe, but now!

580
01:06:02,537 --> 01:06:06,098
Now his papers aren't worth anything.
No one's going to listen to him.

581
01:06:06,174 --> 01:06:08,369
Germany can do as she wishes.

582
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:12,212
You yourselves can do anything you like
in the whole of Europe.

583
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,273
Nobody's going to lift a finger
against you. So why keep us here?

584
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:21,714
Oh, yes, because one day we might remember.

585
01:06:22,624 --> 01:06:26,253
We might say to ourselves what we know
about you, about everyone.

586
01:06:26,328 --> 01:06:29,456
But do you think that day
is going to come, Sophie?

587
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,726
No, it's not.

588
01:06:35,270 --> 01:06:38,831
Herbert still deludes himself.
I don't anymore. You never believed it.

589
01:06:38,907 --> 01:06:41,068
So why? Why keep us here?

590
01:06:43,211 --> 01:06:46,044
Just my presence here
must be unbearable to you...

591
01:06:46,114 --> 01:06:48,548
because it makes you remember
when you want to forget.

592
01:06:48,617 --> 01:06:50,676
I too, I only want to forget.

593
01:06:50,752 --> 01:06:53,277
So let us go away, Sophie. Let us go.

594
01:06:54,456 --> 01:06:56,822
Just one word, one word from you.

595
01:06:57,526 --> 01:06:59,255
One word is enough.

596
01:06:59,694 --> 01:07:03,528
Go. Leave. If this is what you want.

597
01:07:11,306 --> 01:07:13,706
Don't fool yourself, however, Elizabeth.

598
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:16,471
Don't dream of coming back one day
to find a Germany...

599
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:20,811
which was so dear to your heart.
It's finished, that Germany. Forever.

600
01:07:21,216 --> 01:07:24,117
There will be no other Germany but this one.

601
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:27,784
And you will not be able to escape it
or avoid it.

602
01:07:28,490 --> 01:07:32,950
For it will spread before you know it,
all over Europe, and everywhere.

603
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:57,076
<i>Hauptsturmführer</i> Aschenbach.

604
01:07:59,487 --> 01:08:01,387
Baroness von Essenbeck.

605
01:08:22,677 --> 01:08:23,769
Lisa.

606
01:08:24,946 --> 01:08:26,038
Come.

607
01:08:32,921 --> 01:08:34,946
Come, I'll show it to you.

608
01:08:44,332 --> 01:08:47,631
Why were you crying the other day?
I heard you, you know.

609
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:49,966
Did someone hit you?

610
01:08:51,306 --> 01:08:52,705
Your mother?

611
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:56,603
Does she do it often,
on your little tiny ass?

612
01:09:37,886 --> 01:09:38,978
Why?

613
01:10:17,192 --> 01:10:18,784
Stop it, Martin.

614
01:10:20,061 --> 01:10:22,529
Stop it, darling. I've got to go.

615
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:25,430
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to pose.

616
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:26,994
To pose?

617
01:10:28,436 --> 01:10:30,063
No, stay with me.

618
01:10:30,905 --> 01:10:32,770
I'm late.

619
01:10:33,641 --> 01:10:35,609
I've got to go, darling.

620
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:39,245
Didn't you have enough?

621
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:42,810
I'm late, darling. I've got to go.

622
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:46,050
Stop it! Please!

623
01:10:53,795 --> 01:10:56,025
Where the devil is that dress?

624
01:11:01,269 --> 01:11:03,601
Darling, please.

625
01:11:05,240 --> 01:11:06,468
Stop it.

626
01:11:07,542 --> 01:11:09,407
That's enough, Martin.

627
01:11:09,944 --> 01:11:13,971
If you want to be of some help,
why don't you tidy up this room a bit?

628
01:11:14,082 --> 01:11:16,277
Look what a mess you've made.

629
01:11:17,652 --> 01:11:20,143
And that stupid little girl is ill.

630
01:11:20,588 --> 01:11:22,419
- Who?
- Lisa.

631
01:11:22,524 --> 01:11:25,220
I've got to pay for her doctor as well.

632
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:28,059
What's the matter with her? What's she got?

633
01:11:28,129 --> 01:11:30,927
How should I know? Can't understand it.

634
01:11:31,299 --> 01:11:34,996
She's got a high temperature.
Last night she was delirious.

635
01:11:36,237 --> 01:11:37,636
I'm so late.

636
01:11:40,775 --> 01:11:43,266
Martin, what's the matter with you?

637
01:11:43,645 --> 01:11:47,581
Why don't you do as I told you?
This room is in such a mess.

638
01:11:50,885 --> 01:11:52,750
Now, I really must go.

639
01:11:59,093 --> 01:12:02,153
Darling, when you leave,
lock the door, please.

640
01:12:03,932 --> 01:12:05,160
Goodbye.

641
01:13:12,048 --> 01:13:13,140
Lisa.

642
01:14:59,689 --> 01:15:02,317
- You won't forget us?
- I promise.

643
01:15:04,928 --> 01:15:07,021
We are going to miss you so.

644
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:10,588
But you know that you're welcome with
Herbert and I, anytime you want.

645
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:13,727
- Try to come.
- Yes, I'll try. I really will.

646
01:15:14,838 --> 01:15:19,002
Imagine how excited the children are.
We're all going to see Herbert.

647
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:20,406
Give him my love.

648
01:15:31,450 --> 01:15:34,715
What happened? What are you doing here?

649
01:15:35,888 --> 01:15:37,685
What do you want from me?

650
01:15:37,756 --> 01:15:40,691
I don't know anything!

651
01:15:41,326 --> 01:15:42,657
What do you want?

652
01:15:42,728 --> 01:15:46,755
Look, the house is full of gifts.
Expensive things.

653
01:15:51,236 --> 01:15:54,603
I don't know anything!

654
01:15:57,109 --> 01:15:59,737
When I heard that it concerned
the Baron von Essenbeck...

655
01:15:59,811 --> 01:16:02,075
I took the liberty of calling you.

656
01:16:02,147 --> 01:16:04,672
Otherwise, I would never have dared.

657
01:16:04,917 --> 01:16:08,819
As you can see, I haven't forgotten
all the things you have done for me.

658
01:16:09,254 --> 01:16:13,054
There's no formal charge yet.
Only the usual evidence from the family...

659
01:16:13,125 --> 01:16:15,992
and a name spoken in delirium
by the poor victim.

660
01:16:16,061 --> 01:16:18,552
By the child, I mean. Nothing else.

661
01:16:20,566 --> 01:16:24,297
Nevertheless, the young baron
was seen coming out of a club.

662
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:27,465
One of those clubs, you know.

663
01:16:28,273 --> 01:16:29,934
On Grabenstrasse.

664
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,547
I'll take care of it.

665
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:57,328
Take her with you.

666
01:16:58,971 --> 01:17:01,906
I don't want to go to the police!
Get out of here!

667
01:17:01,974 --> 01:17:04,340
I don't want to go!

668
01:17:04,443 --> 01:17:07,105
- Go away!
- Shut up!

669
01:17:31,169 --> 01:17:32,500
Read this.

670
01:17:34,206 --> 01:17:35,798
It's incredible.

671
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:57,654
- What does it mean?
- That's what I want to know.

672
01:17:58,130 --> 01:18:01,395
When has Martin ever shown
this kind of initiative?

673
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,797
To call an extraordinary meeting
of the board of directors.

674
01:18:07,773 --> 01:18:10,833
Of course,
he is the major shareholder, Sophie.

675
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,678
He can do as he pleases.

676
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,281
But why does he want to call a meeting
of a board of directors?

677
01:18:18,350 --> 01:18:20,250
We'll know soon enough.

678
01:18:21,853 --> 01:18:24,048
- Do you know where he is?
- No.

679
01:18:25,257 --> 01:18:28,988
I've been looking for him.
He can't be found, Sophie.

680
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:34,660
He was last seen
in a bar in Düsseldorf three days ago.

681
01:18:36,335 --> 01:18:39,668
- Now they've lost all track of him.
- He must be found.

682
01:18:40,138 --> 01:18:43,073
We'll turn Germany upside down if necessary.

683
01:18:59,558 --> 01:19:02,652
- But the president--
- The president is not here!

684
01:19:02,794 --> 01:19:04,989
In his absence, you will do as I tell you.

685
01:19:05,063 --> 01:19:07,793
But we have received direct orders
that do not--

686
01:19:07,866 --> 01:19:10,130
I assume every responsibility.

687
01:19:17,509 --> 01:19:20,842
The whole shipment must be diverted
to Stuttgart...

688
01:19:24,249 --> 01:19:27,514
and delivered to the area SA command.

689
01:19:28,253 --> 01:19:29,777
You understand?

690
01:20:17,836 --> 01:20:18,996
Hello.

691
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:36,380
- What's happening, Frederick?
- All right, don't worry.

692
01:20:37,756 --> 01:20:41,749
We'll find him.
We've got half the city looking for him.

693
01:21:09,788 --> 01:21:11,585
Try Aschenbach again.

694
01:21:13,792 --> 01:21:17,319
- It's too early.
- It's almost 3:00. You can always try!

695
01:21:35,547 --> 01:21:39,711
<i>Hauptsturmführer</i> Aschenbach. It's urgent.

696
01:21:53,231 --> 01:21:54,596
Frederick.

697
01:22:01,873 --> 01:22:04,433
Bruckmann, Frederick Bruckmann.

698
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:07,540
From the castle at Kleistburg.

699
01:22:09,347 --> 01:22:10,746
Yes, I'll wait.

700
01:23:13,545 --> 01:23:14,773
Martin.

701
01:23:17,649 --> 01:23:20,083
What are you afraid of? Answer me!

702
01:23:20,752 --> 01:23:22,686
Why does Konstantin keep you in here?

703
01:23:23,154 --> 01:23:26,146
What does he want?
What have you promised him? Martin!

704
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,450
Konstantin?

705
01:23:31,029 --> 01:23:32,963
What happened, Martin?

706
01:23:33,131 --> 01:23:36,658
- I'm afraid. I'm in his hands.
- No, Martin.

707
01:23:36,835 --> 01:23:39,065
- I'm afraid.
- No.

708
01:23:44,242 --> 01:23:47,405
- I'll help you. Tell me everything.
- No.

709
01:23:47,479 --> 01:23:51,540
I must know everything in order
to help you! Tell me, Martin.

710
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:56,516
Speak, Martin.

711
01:23:56,588 --> 01:23:58,749
Is he the one who made you write that letter?

712
01:23:58,823 --> 01:24:00,120
No!

713
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:03,190
Is he the one who made you write that letter?

714
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:11,660
I'll take care of it, dear.

715
01:24:14,005 --> 01:24:15,768
Your mother will protect you.

716
01:24:17,008 --> 01:24:20,910
Then the moment has come
to crush the innocent little flower...

717
01:24:21,312 --> 01:24:23,940
because the flower obstructs our path.

718
01:24:25,050 --> 01:24:28,952
I have already pre-announced
to Frederick a similar occurrence.

719
01:24:30,055 --> 01:24:34,890
But Frederick has not developed well
his sense of the Hegelian system.

720
01:24:37,095 --> 01:24:39,791
When is the board of directors meeting?

721
01:24:39,964 --> 01:24:42,694
Within a month, according to the bylaws.

722
01:24:43,068 --> 01:24:45,059
And what will be the procedure?

723
01:24:45,236 --> 01:24:48,501
Very simple. Konstantin will ask
for verification of the powers.

724
01:24:48,573 --> 01:24:50,234
There will be a vote.

725
01:24:50,308 --> 01:24:54,005
Martin, who has the major stock,
will withdraw his support from Frederick--

726
01:24:54,079 --> 01:24:56,411
Will pass it on to Konstantin.

727
01:24:56,481 --> 01:25:00,645
But how did Konstantin
get his hands on Martin?

728
01:25:01,720 --> 01:25:05,588
He has many friends in the Police, SA,
even the Gestapo.

729
01:25:06,024 --> 01:25:07,924
Another cord to cut.

730
01:25:09,260 --> 01:25:13,287
Very soon, however,
the files regarding Martin will pass into...

731
01:25:13,598 --> 01:25:15,395
more important hands.

732
01:25:16,334 --> 01:25:17,323
Come.

733
01:26:08,486 --> 01:26:12,115
These are the most complete archives
ever to be conceived.

734
01:26:13,391 --> 01:26:16,451
This is the secret Germany.
Nothing is lacking.

735
01:26:17,695 --> 01:26:20,789
You can even find your history,
and Frederick's.

736
01:26:21,399 --> 01:26:23,162
Can you believe it?

737
01:26:24,202 --> 01:26:27,228
You see, it's not very difficult to enter...

738
01:26:28,006 --> 01:26:29,997
into the lives of people.

739
01:26:30,975 --> 01:26:34,911
Every German citizen today
is potentially one of our informers.

740
01:26:36,080 --> 01:26:39,675
The collective thinking of our people
is now complicity.

741
01:26:40,752 --> 01:26:44,745
Don't you think that this is
the true miracle of the Third Reich?

742
01:26:48,693 --> 01:26:52,129
If you wish, we can read
Konstantin's future together.

743
01:26:53,731 --> 01:26:55,255
If he has one.

744
01:26:55,733 --> 01:27:00,397
Konstantin will always have a future
as long as his friends are in power.

745
01:27:00,572 --> 01:27:03,507
If I were you, I wouldn't be so pessimistic.

746
01:27:03,608 --> 01:27:07,237
You see, Sophie, if we need the SA
to conquer Germany...

747
01:27:07,979 --> 01:27:11,039
to conquer the world, we need the Army.

748
01:27:11,649 --> 01:27:13,810
But the Army wants no part of the SA.

749
01:27:13,885 --> 01:27:17,218
The generals have been explicit.
"Either us or them."

750
01:27:17,755 --> 01:27:21,885
Do you want the Chancellor
to be displeased with our fine generals?

751
01:27:22,527 --> 01:27:26,224
Do you think Hitler is willing
to put his friend Röhm in the background?

752
01:27:26,297 --> 01:27:28,231
In the background? A man like Röhm?

753
01:27:28,299 --> 01:27:31,393
That wouldn't be enough,
and too much of a risk.

754
01:27:32,036 --> 01:27:34,630
Certain things are not done halfway.

755
01:27:37,575 --> 01:27:40,738
Konstantin is your risk as much as ours.

756
01:27:40,812 --> 01:27:45,146
- For you, it would be easy.
- No, cousin Sophie, that is not so.

757
01:27:46,284 --> 01:27:49,185
It's nice of you to try to save...

758
01:27:49,254 --> 01:27:52,815
Frederick from such a distasteful task...

759
01:27:53,858 --> 01:27:55,792
but the terms are very clear.

760
01:27:55,860 --> 01:27:59,023
We also share the disadvantages
of our alliance.

761
01:27:59,764 --> 01:28:02,324
Frederick will do what must be done.

762
01:28:02,867 --> 01:28:07,065
But I would like you to help me never
to expose him to this sort of thing again.

763
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:08,765
What do you mean?

764
01:28:09,908 --> 01:28:13,366
I would like you to help to transform
the Essenbeck Corporation...

765
01:28:13,444 --> 01:28:16,971
from a family enterprise
to a company with a sole owner.

766
01:28:17,048 --> 01:28:19,243
And since Frederick's name is not Essenbeck--

767
01:28:19,317 --> 01:28:23,083
- It's impossible.
- Nothing is impossible in this country.

768
01:28:23,821 --> 01:28:25,584
A decree is sufficient.

769
01:28:25,657 --> 01:28:30,151
And Frederick will be able to obtain
the name and the title of Essenbeck.

770
01:28:30,929 --> 01:28:33,124
Don't you think you are demanding too much?

771
01:28:33,197 --> 01:28:35,165
You are also demanding.

772
01:28:37,468 --> 01:28:41,370
You know the hostility that still interferes
with our marriage.

773
01:28:43,708 --> 01:28:47,906
Yours is a beautiful love story.

774
01:28:52,817 --> 01:28:54,580
An exemplary story.

775
01:28:55,353 --> 01:28:59,585
But I don't see how it is directly connected
with the life of the Third Reich.

776
01:28:59,657 --> 01:29:01,750
It's not just a love story.

777
01:29:03,461 --> 01:29:05,929
To wage war, they want cannons.

778
01:29:06,998 --> 01:29:10,092
They won't have enough
without the Essenbeck Steelworks.

779
01:29:10,168 --> 01:29:12,193
Watch out, cousin Aschenbach.

780
01:29:12,270 --> 01:29:15,797
In this negotiation, I don't have
less of an argument than you have.

781
01:29:15,873 --> 01:29:19,832
What made you suddenly
become such a miser with concessions?

782
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:22,209
That's not difficult to answer.

783
01:29:23,614 --> 01:29:25,844
In every question of power...

784
01:29:27,051 --> 01:29:30,714
always an alternative is necessary,
even hypothetical.

785
01:29:31,522 --> 01:29:35,219
- It's the first rule in the art of governing.
- Enough. I understand.

786
01:29:35,426 --> 01:29:40,193
That means, it doesn't seem practical
to put everything in Frederick's hands...

787
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:43,326
even that which is Martin's.

788
01:29:45,803 --> 01:29:47,703
He's your son, Sophie.

789
01:29:48,473 --> 01:29:51,601
Must I always be the one
to remind you of that?

790
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:10,123
I can't believe it's possible.

791
01:30:10,995 --> 01:30:14,055
- When?
- Soon, Frederick.

792
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:17,093
Much sooner than you think.

793
01:30:27,045 --> 01:30:28,569
And Aschenbach?

794
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:32,813
Aschenbach is against it.
But what does that mean?

795
01:30:33,484 --> 01:30:36,317
He, too, will find himself faced
with a <i>fait accompli</i>.

796
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:40,187
Can't you understand
that you count more than he does by now?

797
01:30:40,258 --> 01:30:42,419
Aschenbach produces words.

798
01:30:43,094 --> 01:30:44,925
You produce cannons.

799
01:30:45,063 --> 01:30:48,260
It's the one thing that carries weight,
believe me...

800
01:30:48,433 --> 01:30:50,663
above all, to the chancellery.

801
01:30:51,769 --> 01:30:55,034
The decree, Frederick. Don't you think so?

802
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:59,574
Frederick von Essenbeck.

803
01:31:11,055 --> 01:31:14,388
Power. All the power or nothing.

804
01:31:15,093 --> 01:31:16,355
Remember?

805
01:31:17,795 --> 01:31:20,992
Then we'll get married. Very soon.

806
01:31:22,266 --> 01:31:24,894
You and I together, forever.

807
01:31:32,543 --> 01:31:33,908
And Martin?

808
01:31:36,481 --> 01:31:39,279
Martin has never been a problem.

809
01:31:42,220 --> 01:31:45,280
And Konstantin, has he never been a problem?

810
01:31:51,796 --> 01:31:53,525
You have to do it.

811
01:31:57,668 --> 01:31:59,226
It's your move.

812
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:07,539
Oh, God.

813
01:32:16,554 --> 01:32:19,022
I am not afraid, Sophie.

814
01:32:27,365 --> 01:32:28,730
Joachim...

815
01:32:30,334 --> 01:32:31,767
Konstantin...

816
01:32:34,005 --> 01:32:35,495
and tomorrow?

817
01:32:39,010 --> 01:32:41,308
God, the complicity grows.

818
01:32:43,314 --> 01:32:44,804
And I know...

819
01:32:47,685 --> 01:32:50,620
I'll be trapped with Aschenbach all my life.

820
01:32:54,358 --> 01:32:56,588
When you are at the peak of the pyramid...

821
01:32:56,661 --> 01:32:59,630
not even Aschenbach will have power over you.

822
01:33:00,831 --> 01:33:02,389
Oh, my God.

823
01:33:04,035 --> 01:33:06,469
I've accepted a ruthless logic...

824
01:33:09,640 --> 01:33:12,370
and I can never get away from it.

825
01:33:17,882 --> 01:33:19,008
When?

826
01:33:19,550 --> 01:33:22,314
Aschenbach will tell you where and when.

827
01:33:23,321 --> 01:33:26,552
WELCOME TO THE SA IN BAD WIESSEE

828
01:33:31,896 --> 01:33:35,593
<i>I've not been in Wiessee since Munich.</i>

829
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:38,931
<i>Those were bad days. Now it will be
all right, don't you think so?</i>

830
01:33:39,003 --> 01:33:41,995
<i>When I think of Munich,
I think of a putsch...</i>

831
01:33:42,073 --> 01:33:44,541
<i>a whore, and a flea-ridden cell.</i>

832
01:33:44,609 --> 01:33:48,136
<i>Me, too. The putsch and the cell
must have been the same.</i>

833
01:33:48,212 --> 01:33:50,544
<i>And I bet it was the same whore.</i>

834
01:33:52,083 --> 01:33:53,482
<i>Ready!</i>

835
01:33:57,855 --> 01:33:59,186
<i>Fire!</i>

836
01:34:08,466 --> 01:34:10,866
<i>Nothing happens to the old one.</i>

837
01:34:13,838 --> 01:34:18,434
<i>Today they have a holiday for Hindenburg.
And tomorrow, maybe the Chancellor.</i>

838
01:34:18,576 --> 01:34:21,602
<i>That is a wonderful idea.
He gets on my nerves.</i>

839
01:34:40,598 --> 01:34:44,762
<i>Halt, this is the boss. He arrives by car,
because he gets sick on the train.</i>

840
01:39:45,402 --> 01:39:47,962
<i>I have no shoulder to cry on.</i>

841
01:39:50,975 --> 01:39:55,935
<i>Roderich, you and I will end up in
the heavens.</i>

842
01:39:57,915 --> 01:40:02,875
<i>So don't kick me out of here.</i>

843
01:40:07,925 --> 01:40:10,485
<i>I've got no one in the whole world.</i>

844
01:40:36,253 --> 01:40:39,711
<i>Röhm would be a fool
to be let down by Hitler.</i>

845
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:41,724
<i>Fool, how can you say that?</i>

846
01:40:42,159 --> 01:40:45,185
<i>They were very close,
their hearts and souls together.</i>

847
01:40:45,629 --> 01:40:50,191
<i>- Don't you think so?
- I can only tell you that if he doesn't stop...</i>

848
01:40:50,267 --> 01:40:55,170
<i>making difficulties for us,
only his moustache will remain.</i>

849
01:40:55,806 --> 01:40:58,969
<i>Damn! We've brought him to the position
he now holds.</i>

850
01:40:59,643 --> 01:41:02,237
<i>Be fair to the armed forces.</i>

851
01:41:03,781 --> 01:41:08,775
<i>How long do you think
this nice vacation will last?</i>

852
01:41:09,553 --> 01:41:13,216
<i>We will stay here until they have agreed.</i>

853
01:41:15,492 --> 01:41:17,517
<i>And if they do not agree?</i>

854
01:41:17,928 --> 01:41:20,055
<i>Then there will be a fight.</i>

855
01:41:21,098 --> 01:41:22,531
<i>What else?</i>

856
01:41:23,167 --> 01:41:27,194
<i>Let's go in. You are missing the best.</i>

857
01:49:08,899 --> 01:49:10,696
<i>They're all dead. Let's go.</i>

858
01:50:06,323 --> 01:50:08,348
<i>Let it... Let it...</i>

859
01:50:32,983 --> 01:50:36,885
<i>I realized immediately what she was
about to do. I understood.</i>

860
01:50:38,722 --> 01:50:41,156
<i>I don't know why, but I understood.</i>

861
01:50:42,425 --> 01:50:45,883
<i>I did not move. I did nothing to stop her.</i>

862
01:50:47,731 --> 01:50:50,666
<i>I sat in Olga's room without moving a finger.</i>

863
01:50:50,834 --> 01:50:53,268
<i>There was a deathly silence all around.</i>

864
01:50:53,803 --> 01:50:57,034
<i>And when night came, I stayed there, waiting.</i>

865
01:51:02,545 --> 01:51:07,073
Calm yourself.
I didn't bring you here to blackmail you.

866
01:51:09,252 --> 01:51:11,447
Konstantin has already tried.

867
01:51:12,856 --> 01:51:15,051
It didn't bring him any luck.

868
01:51:16,159 --> 01:51:19,993
And then to put you in real trouble,
you, the son of a hero...

869
01:51:20,063 --> 01:51:23,328
the true hero, the only von Essenbeck.

870
01:51:25,268 --> 01:51:27,293
Just because a little Jewess...

871
01:51:29,873 --> 01:51:32,307
had the bad taste to hang herself.

872
01:51:34,010 --> 01:51:36,308
Didn't you know? Jew.

873
01:51:38,848 --> 01:51:43,217
According to the new order,
yours isn't even a crime. In fact, it's...

874
01:51:45,588 --> 01:51:49,547
But that's not enough
to say we are friends or allies.

875
01:51:51,528 --> 01:51:52,722
Allies?

876
01:51:55,999 --> 01:51:57,398
If you wish.

877
01:51:58,335 --> 01:52:00,269
I thought that you and Frederick--

878
01:52:00,337 --> 01:52:03,795
I thought so, too, until yesterday.

879
01:52:05,508 --> 01:52:08,136
Frederick thinks he's become irreplaceable...

880
01:52:09,546 --> 01:52:10,945
but he's mistaken.

881
01:52:11,514 --> 01:52:14,745
Only he who acknowledges he can lose
from one day to the next...

882
01:52:14,818 --> 01:52:17,286
everything he might've gained,
thanks to our support:

883
01:52:17,354 --> 01:52:19,845
That, yes, is a trustworthy friend.

884
01:52:21,825 --> 01:52:26,228
But he who wants to become
master of all, even of himself...

885
01:52:27,097 --> 01:52:29,327
who deludes himself into thinking...

886
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:32,828
he is able to make his own decisions...

887
01:52:33,236 --> 01:52:36,501
to think by himself:

888
01:52:37,440 --> 01:52:38,702
That, no.

889
01:52:42,412 --> 01:52:47,111
You don't have these pretensions.
Right, Martin?

890
01:52:49,386 --> 01:52:52,287
But isn't it too late? The decree?

891
01:52:52,756 --> 01:52:57,591
The decree. Suddenly, that piece of paper
has got a tremendous value...

892
01:52:58,695 --> 01:53:02,131
as long as the receiver is in a position
to enjoy it.

893
01:53:03,566 --> 01:53:07,627
They are using National Socialism
as an instrument for their own ambitions.

894
01:53:09,172 --> 01:53:13,006
They still don't understand
what National Socialism really is.

895
01:53:13,176 --> 01:53:15,144
But they've already cut me out!

896
01:53:15,211 --> 01:53:17,941
Frederick can appoint his own successor.

897
01:53:18,348 --> 01:53:23,047
As far as I know,
Frederick has no sons... yet.

898
01:53:25,455 --> 01:53:28,322
Your mother, on the other hand, has one.

899
01:53:29,993 --> 01:53:31,722
You, Martin.

900
01:53:45,108 --> 01:53:46,871
It would be so easy.

901
01:53:55,618 --> 01:53:57,586
But if you're afraid...

902
01:53:58,855 --> 01:54:02,723
I'm not afraid. I have waited years for this.

903
01:54:07,096 --> 01:54:11,499
I don't say afraid of Frederick,
but of your mother.

904
01:54:23,246 --> 01:54:26,977
I could do anything
to destroy her security, her strength...

905
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:29,012
and her power.

906
01:54:30,487 --> 01:54:31,749
Anything!

907
01:54:33,056 --> 01:54:34,751
I was always kept apart.

908
01:54:36,759 --> 01:54:39,091
She only wanted to humiliate me.

909
01:54:41,598 --> 01:54:45,796
She never realized
that I loved her and needed her.

910
01:54:47,670 --> 01:54:49,035
And I really did.

911
01:54:52,475 --> 01:54:55,000
But now, all that changed to hate.

912
01:54:56,346 --> 01:54:57,711
I hate her.

913
01:55:00,717 --> 01:55:02,116
Very simple.

914
01:55:02,752 --> 01:55:05,448
I want to see her weak...

915
01:55:06,289 --> 01:55:09,224
ruined and alone.

916
01:55:12,028 --> 01:55:15,828
Help me, please. I'll do what you say.
I'll do anything.

917
01:55:16,599 --> 01:55:20,695
- Anything to accomplish this.
- Yes, Martin.

918
01:55:22,171 --> 01:55:23,763
I will help you.

919
01:55:25,909 --> 01:55:28,036
I won't give them any peace.

920
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:03,242
Gunther, pay a little attention.

921
01:56:06,282 --> 01:56:08,546
Uncle Frederick has something to say.

922
01:56:11,287 --> 01:56:15,451
I bet that you're now going to tell us
the date of the wedding.

923
01:56:20,930 --> 01:56:24,127
- I shall try not to miss it.
- You won't miss it, Martin.

924
01:56:26,402 --> 01:56:28,393
Neither will any of the others.

925
01:56:29,372 --> 01:56:31,567
You mean the ones who remain?

926
01:56:34,844 --> 01:56:38,575
I assumed total responsibility
not only of the steelworks...

927
01:56:39,182 --> 01:56:40,877
but of this entire family.

928
01:56:42,118 --> 01:56:45,576
And therefore, I intend to stop this habit...

929
01:56:46,522 --> 01:56:48,285
of taking liberties.

930
01:56:49,058 --> 01:56:50,582
Excuse me, Frederick.

931
01:56:52,028 --> 01:56:54,963
You don't mean to include me
amongst your subjects.

932
01:56:55,698 --> 01:56:57,427
I'm simply a guest.

933
01:56:57,900 --> 01:57:01,131
No, dear cousin. I wouldn't dare.

934
01:57:02,672 --> 01:57:04,833
But if you're a little patient, you can--

935
01:57:04,907 --> 01:57:05,931
Excuse me.

936
01:57:06,009 --> 01:57:09,604
Gunther! I haven't finished yet.

937
01:57:09,679 --> 01:57:11,476
They're not problems which concern me.

938
01:57:11,547 --> 01:57:14,482
They concern you
because you live in this house!

939
01:57:15,018 --> 01:57:16,815
I didn't ask to stay!

940
01:57:18,588 --> 01:57:20,215
And I won't stay very much longer.

941
01:57:20,289 --> 01:57:24,020
I order you! Get back into your place!

942
01:57:36,873 --> 01:57:39,535
At least this can be a moment for truth.

943
01:57:41,210 --> 01:57:45,874
Neither one of you condescended to come
to the opening of the new steelworks.

944
01:57:47,150 --> 01:57:48,981
For one reason or another...

945
01:57:49,052 --> 01:57:53,079
you decided to miss
a most important family obligation.

946
01:57:54,757 --> 01:57:57,248
Your absence was conspicuous to me.

947
01:57:58,394 --> 01:58:02,125
And I insist that this kind of behavior
never happens again!

948
01:58:06,102 --> 01:58:08,969
What is the meaning of all this control?

949
01:58:11,240 --> 01:58:15,609
The impromptu visits, the secrecy,
the spying.

950
01:58:17,613 --> 01:58:20,138
The investigations carried out
by the secret service...

951
01:58:20,216 --> 01:58:22,707
against some of my most trusted colleagues.

952
01:58:23,953 --> 01:58:25,580
What is all this?

953
01:58:27,590 --> 01:58:30,616
For some time,
the works have seemed to be besieged...

954
01:58:31,594 --> 01:58:34,586
and I know very well that none of this
could have taken place...

955
01:58:34,664 --> 01:58:36,529
without your full knowledge.

956
01:58:37,266 --> 01:58:38,756
So what is it?

957
01:58:39,602 --> 01:58:41,126
I assure you...

958
01:58:43,206 --> 01:58:45,401
that no one will leave this room...

959
01:58:46,476 --> 01:58:50,173
until all that has to be said is said.

960
01:59:22,812 --> 01:59:24,336
Can I sit down?

961
01:59:42,832 --> 01:59:44,925
I was sitting here that night.

962
01:59:49,705 --> 01:59:51,536
I don't have much to say.

963
01:59:53,309 --> 01:59:57,939
Elizabeth and the children took the train
to Salzburg on the morning of June 18.

964
02:00:00,216 --> 02:00:01,683
They never arrived.

965
02:00:02,552 --> 02:00:05,578
You know where they were taken? Not even you?

966
02:00:06,355 --> 02:00:09,415
They took them where you decided. To Dachau.

967
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,786
To the internment camp.

968
02:00:12,061 --> 02:00:14,825
I know you didn't mean any harm
to any of them...

969
02:00:14,897 --> 02:00:17,730
you just wanted to compel me to return.

970
02:00:18,034 --> 02:00:20,502
In the interest of justice, of course...

971
02:00:20,870 --> 02:00:22,337
and the steelworks.

972
02:00:23,206 --> 02:00:26,107
And to get rid of anyone
who one day might say:

973
02:00:26,742 --> 02:00:31,236
"Yes, it's true, it was Herbert's gun
that killed Joachim von Essenbeck...

974
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:36,746
"but the hand was another's."

975
02:00:38,087 --> 02:00:39,418
What do you want?

976
02:00:58,007 --> 02:00:59,235
Nothing.

977
02:01:01,944 --> 02:01:04,071
You have succeeded with your plan.

978
02:01:05,114 --> 02:01:07,912
I have returned to give myself up
to the Gestapo.

979
02:01:08,918 --> 02:01:11,478
In exchange, they will release the children.

980
02:01:12,755 --> 02:01:15,690
They won't talk. They can't harm you.

981
02:01:17,760 --> 02:01:19,751
And Elizabeth won't talk.

982
02:01:23,966 --> 02:01:25,331
She's dead.

983
02:01:26,335 --> 02:01:27,825
It's not true.

984
02:01:29,238 --> 02:01:30,762
It is, Gunther.

985
02:01:33,109 --> 02:01:35,509
Someone has to know and remember.

986
02:01:36,178 --> 02:01:40,376
And tell the others,
because they also must know...

987
02:01:41,284 --> 02:01:42,751
and remember.

988
02:02:15,251 --> 02:02:17,845
Uncle Herbert! Wait for me.

989
02:02:18,387 --> 02:02:20,651
Gunther, where are you going?

990
02:02:26,963 --> 02:02:30,023
Gunther! Stop.

991
02:02:30,666 --> 02:02:34,363
Where are you going? Idiot!
You haven't heard the best yet.

992
02:02:37,073 --> 02:02:38,597
- Idiot.
- Martin!

993
02:02:39,742 --> 02:02:41,471
Come with me. Come.

994
02:02:45,047 --> 02:02:46,446
Look at him.

995
02:02:48,117 --> 02:02:52,747
It's he who killed your father.
He! With his own hands.

996
02:02:53,122 --> 02:02:56,023
Don't you believe it? Why don't you ask him?

997
02:02:56,525 --> 02:03:00,427
Tell him! How many shots did you fire?
One, two, three?

998
02:03:01,030 --> 02:03:03,396
You can tell him now. Who could prove it?

999
02:03:04,934 --> 02:03:06,959
Why did you do it?

1000
02:03:07,036 --> 02:03:10,904
Because Frederick said that we have
to say everything that needed to be said.

1001
02:03:11,240 --> 02:03:14,539
I cooperated. Isn't that what you wanted?

1002
02:03:15,044 --> 02:03:16,568
The sole owner.

1003
02:03:18,614 --> 02:03:22,812
I'll make you pay for that, you little swine.

1004
02:03:23,886 --> 02:03:27,151
But don't you understand
that something's changing in this house?

1005
02:03:27,790 --> 02:03:30,258
I'm not afraid of you anymore, Frederick.

1006
02:03:30,993 --> 02:03:33,359
And even if it seems paradoxical to you...

1007
02:03:34,263 --> 02:03:38,222
if anyone should be afraid among us,
it's you...

1008
02:03:39,301 --> 02:03:43,260
from now on. And you, too, Mother.

1009
02:03:53,949 --> 02:03:55,883
What do you want of Frederick?

1010
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:04,282
- Everything.
- You're crazy, Martin.

1011
02:04:04,360 --> 02:04:06,123
I want everything, Mother.

1012
02:04:06,762 --> 02:04:09,890
And I'll take everything.
Everything that belongs to me.

1013
02:04:10,566 --> 02:04:12,158
I won't let you!

1014
02:04:15,171 --> 02:04:17,196
- Mother!
- Ask my pardon.

1015
02:04:17,273 --> 02:04:20,606
Kneel and ask my pardon.

1016
02:04:21,177 --> 02:04:22,371
Mother!

1017
02:04:27,483 --> 02:04:32,147
Kneel, and ask my pardon, on your knees!

1018
02:04:33,989 --> 02:04:37,948
No, Martin, no. On your knees.

1019
02:04:38,694 --> 02:04:40,855
On your knees!

1020
02:05:12,027 --> 02:05:16,657
Tomorrow Martin will repent, you'll see.
He'll ask my pardon.

1021
02:05:17,666 --> 02:05:19,190
He will repent.

1022
02:05:26,242 --> 02:05:27,334
Come.

1023
02:05:53,002 --> 02:05:53,900
Gunther.

1024
02:05:58,140 --> 02:06:01,701
I will kill them. If you want, I will kill them.

1025
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:07,410
You see, Gunther, you, tonight...

1026
02:06:09,852 --> 02:06:12,753
have acquired something truly extraordinary.

1027
02:06:14,823 --> 02:06:18,190
The brutality of your father,
Frederick's ambition...

1028
02:06:18,928 --> 02:06:21,260
even the ruthlessness of Martin.

1029
02:06:23,332 --> 02:06:26,768
But all that is nothing
compared to what you already possess.

1030
02:06:28,437 --> 02:06:32,100
Hate, Gunther! You possess hate!

1031
02:06:33,442 --> 02:06:36,411
It's a young hate. Pure. Absolute.

1032
02:06:37,479 --> 02:06:42,212
But be careful. This potential
of energy and fury is too important...

1033
02:06:42,284 --> 02:06:44,775
to use it in a paltry private vendetta.

1034
02:06:45,621 --> 02:06:48,249
It would be a luxury. A useless waste.

1035
02:06:49,425 --> 02:06:52,724
To destroy Frederick,
the venomous bite of an asp is enough.

1036
02:06:53,762 --> 02:06:55,627
You will come with me.

1037
02:06:56,732 --> 02:06:59,724
We will teach you to administer
your immense wealth.

1038
02:07:00,569 --> 02:07:02,764
To invest it in a better way.

1039
02:07:04,240 --> 02:07:06,674
You understand, don't you?

1040
02:07:07,843 --> 02:07:08,935
Come.

1041
02:07:14,717 --> 02:07:16,048
Gunther...

1042
02:07:19,321 --> 02:07:20,413
come.

1043
02:09:53,175 --> 02:09:55,302
Martin, what are you doing here?

1044
02:10:01,216 --> 02:10:04,208
Go away, Mother. Go away, please.

1045
02:10:08,524 --> 02:10:10,389
It's he who sends you.

1046
02:10:12,161 --> 02:10:14,152
Why do you hate him so?

1047
02:10:19,234 --> 02:10:22,567
And me? Do you also hate your mother?

1048
02:10:23,605 --> 02:10:27,541
Go away, Mother. Please, go away.

1049
02:11:01,143 --> 02:11:03,077
You don't know the risk you are running...

1050
02:11:03,145 --> 02:11:06,046
by putting yourself into Aschenbach's hands.

1051
02:11:09,318 --> 02:11:11,309
How can you have faith in him?

1052
02:11:13,555 --> 02:11:15,648
Should I have faith in you?

1053
02:11:19,962 --> 02:11:21,486
Listen, Martin.

1054
02:11:21,930 --> 02:11:25,422
You listen, Mother.
It's not Aschenbach who makes me afraid.

1055
02:11:25,901 --> 02:11:27,368
It's not Frederick.

1056
02:11:29,738 --> 02:11:31,672
It's you, Mother.

1057
02:11:32,374 --> 02:11:34,638
You, who's always been my nightmare.

1058
02:11:35,577 --> 02:11:39,377
You, with your oppression, with your will
to subjugate me at all costs...

1059
02:11:40,115 --> 02:11:41,343
in every way.

1060
02:11:41,683 --> 02:11:43,947
With your idiotic wigs and lipsticks.

1061
02:11:51,894 --> 02:11:54,294
You've never loved me. Never.

1062
02:11:56,164 --> 02:11:58,098
You have always preferred him.

1063
02:12:06,008 --> 02:12:09,466
You gave him everything,
everything that belongs to me.

1064
02:12:09,711 --> 02:12:12,771
My factory, my money, my house,
brick by brick.

1065
02:12:13,248 --> 02:12:17,048
Even my name! And your love.

1066
02:12:18,654 --> 02:12:20,281
You're the worst.

1067
02:12:22,791 --> 02:12:24,816
So it's you I hate!

1068
02:12:25,894 --> 02:12:28,829
You can't imagine the evil I wish you!

1069
02:12:37,639 --> 02:12:39,766
I will destroy you, Mother.

1070
02:12:54,323 --> 02:12:55,551
Martin!

1071
02:13:18,013 --> 02:13:20,914
Martin! No!

1072
02:16:56,431 --> 02:16:58,626
Sophie, we must do something.

1073
02:17:01,236 --> 02:17:05,332
We can't stay inside. Isolated.

1074
02:17:07,609 --> 02:17:09,406
Prisoners in our own house.

1075
02:17:11,246 --> 02:17:13,714
Hunted just as Aschenbach wanted us to be.

1076
02:17:18,486 --> 02:17:19,680
Sophie.

1077
02:17:23,425 --> 02:17:25,950
I will not be destroyed in this way!

1078
02:17:44,579 --> 02:17:46,103
I've learned to kill.

1079
02:17:49,251 --> 02:17:50,912
The game isn't over yet.

1080
02:17:52,954 --> 02:17:54,785
And I'll go to the very end.

1081
02:17:56,892 --> 02:17:58,621
But you must want it, too.

1082
02:18:01,496 --> 02:18:02,861
You must help me.

1083
02:18:05,033 --> 02:18:07,024
I will not let Martin strip...

1084
02:18:08,870 --> 02:18:12,704
I won't let Martin strip me
of all the things I have gained.

1085
02:18:16,945 --> 02:18:18,537
We can still break him.

1086
02:18:21,716 --> 02:18:23,081
I only need you.

1087
02:18:26,054 --> 02:18:28,022
Sophie, I only need you.

1088
02:18:43,772 --> 02:18:45,137
I need you.

1089
02:18:55,850 --> 02:18:57,408
I need you!

1090
02:18:58,420 --> 02:19:00,354
Don't abandon me now!

1091
02:19:11,032 --> 02:19:12,590
I beg of you.

1092
02:19:13,868 --> 02:19:15,836
Don't abandon me now.

1093
02:19:21,376 --> 02:19:22,843
Not you, too.

1094
02:20:25,907 --> 02:20:29,741
Mommy and Martin

1095
02:20:31,613 --> 02:20:33,581
Martin kills Mommy

1096
02:20:58,373 --> 02:20:59,465
Come.

1097
02:21:06,481 --> 02:21:08,745
I brought some of my friends with me.

1098
02:21:10,418 --> 02:21:13,148
Otherwise, what kind of celebration
would it be?

1099
02:21:18,927 --> 02:21:20,622
You seem depressed.

1100
02:21:23,131 --> 02:21:27,761
And it's your wedding day,
Frederick von Essenbeck.

1101
02:22:08,710 --> 02:22:10,769
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1102
02:22:16,951 --> 02:22:18,919
It's just a piece of paper, Frederick.

1103
02:22:18,987 --> 02:22:21,922
You were wrong to place
so much importance to it.

1104
02:22:21,990 --> 02:22:24,891
These days, decrees are very unreliable.

1105
02:22:39,774 --> 02:22:41,867
Aschenbach said
that you haven't understood...

1106
02:22:41,943 --> 02:22:43,638
anything of National Socialism.

1107
02:22:44,379 --> 02:22:48,315
And yet it's not a very difficult thing.
Even I have understood it.

1108
02:22:57,859 --> 02:23:01,022
Now hurry up, Frederick. Mother is waiting.

1109
02:24:34,589 --> 02:24:36,386
Come on. Light the candles.

1110
02:25:27,775 --> 02:25:29,003
Come on.

1111
02:27:12,346 --> 02:27:14,940
Do you claim to be of the Aryan race?

1112
02:27:19,987 --> 02:27:22,046
- Yes.
- Yes.

1113
02:27:22,857 --> 02:27:27,021
Do any hereditary diseases
exist in your family?

1114
02:27:31,165 --> 02:27:32,757
- No.
- No.

1115
02:29:11,532 --> 02:29:13,329
Thank you for coming.

1116
02:29:16,170 --> 02:29:17,501
Thank you.

1117
02:36:41,548 --> 02:36:42,879
English
