1
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,133
How you doing, Keaton?

2
00:03:38,762 --> 00:03:41,181
I can't feel my legs...

3
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:44,726
...Keyser.

4
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,148
Ready?

5
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:03,120
What time is it?

6
00:04:04,538 --> 00:04:05,747
12:30.

7
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,024
It all started back in New York
six weeks ago.

8
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:17,736
A truck loaded with gun parts
got jacked outside of Queens.

9
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:20,238
The driver saw nobody,
but someone fucked up.

10
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:23,158
He heard a voice.
Sometimes that's all you need.

11
00:05:26,703 --> 00:05:27,746
Mr. McManus?

12
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,999
Christ! Don't you fucking guys
ever sleep?

13
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,461
- We have a warrant for your arrest.
- Fuck you, pig.

14
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,595
Todd Hockney?

15
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:47,140
- Who wants to know?
- New York Police Department.

16
00:05:51,728 --> 00:05:52,562
Shit!

17
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:54,856
- Freeze!
- Hold it!

18
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:01,947
You sure you brought enough guys?

19
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:38,692
It's quite simple.

20
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:43,697
A restaurant that changes with the
taste without losing the esthetic.

21
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:48,452
In other words, the atmosphere
will not be painted on the walls.

22
00:06:49,745 --> 00:06:51,288
Let me give you an example.

23
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,457
This I had to see for myself.

24
00:06:56,251 --> 00:06:57,043
David.

25
00:06:58,503 --> 00:07:00,547
- I'm in a meeting.
- Time for another one.

26
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,092
Everyone, this is David Kujan.

27
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,220
Special Agent Kujan, U.S. Customs.

28
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:10,348
These men are from
the New York Police Department.

29
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:13,894
You look good, Keaton.
Better than I'd have thought.

30
00:07:14,144 --> 00:07:15,395
You have a problem?

31
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:19,316
A small matter of a stolen truck
loaded with guns.

32
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,070
Mr. Keaton?

33
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,572
Will you excuse us for a moment?

34
00:07:27,908 --> 00:07:31,411
We have some questions to ask you
downtown. You'll be a while.

35
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:35,457
No, no, no, please.
Please, sit down.

36
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,835
This is a small problem.

37
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:40,212
Enjoy the meal.

38
00:07:40,504 --> 00:07:42,047
Talk to you later.

39
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,571
<i>It didn't make sense</i>
<i>that I'd be there.</i>

40
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:09,574
<i>These guys were hard-core hijackers.</i>

41
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,868
<i>But there I was.</i>

42
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:16,039
<i>At that point, I wasn't scared.</i>

43
00:08:16,289 --> 00:08:19,376
<i>I knew I hadn't done anything</i>
<i>they could do me for.</i>

44
00:08:20,127 --> 00:08:22,003
<i>Besides, it was fun.</i>

45
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,798
<i>I got to make like I was notorious.</i>

46
00:08:25,757 --> 00:08:27,134
<i>You all know the drill.</i>

47
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:32,139
<i>When your number is called,</i>
<i>repeat the phrase you've been given.</i>

48
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:34,808
<i>Number one, step forward.</i>

49
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:42,107
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

50
00:08:43,859 --> 00:08:46,278
<i>Number two, step forward.</i>

51
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:52,242
Give me the fucking keys,
you cocksucker, motherfucker...

52
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:56,163
Knock it off. Get back.
Number three, step forward.

53
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,425
- Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.
- <i>In English, please.</i>

54
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,885
Excuse me?

55
00:09:10,177 --> 00:09:12,137
<i>In English.</i>

56
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:15,265
Hand me the keys, you cocksucker.
What the fuck?

57
00:09:15,515 --> 00:09:17,392
<i>Number four, step forward.</i>

58
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:20,479
<i>It was bullshit.</i>
<i>The whole rap was a setup.</i>

59
00:09:20,729 --> 00:09:23,815
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

60
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:25,484
<i>It was the cops' fault.</i>

61
00:09:25,776 --> 00:09:28,653
<i>You don't put guys like that</i>
<i>into a room together.</i>

62
00:09:28,945 --> 00:09:30,906
<i>Who knows what can happen.</i>

63
00:09:31,198 --> 00:09:35,077
Hand me the keys,
you fucking cocksucker.

64
00:09:35,368 --> 00:09:38,455
This has really gotta be
embarrassing for you guys.

65
00:09:38,747 --> 00:09:43,251
<i>Someone was pissed about that</i>
<i>hijacked truck. The cops had nothing.</i>

66
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:46,546
<i>They hoped somebody would slip</i>
<i>and give them something.</i>

67
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:50,717
<i>They knew we wouldn't fight it</i>
<i>because they knew how to lean on us.</i>

68
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:54,679
<i>Our rights went out the window.</i>
<i>It was a violation. Disgraceful.</i>

69
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,516
<i>They went after McManus first.</i>
<i>Topnotch entry man.</i>

70
00:09:57,808 --> 00:09:59,267
What truck?

71
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:03,063
- The truck with the guns, fucko.
- Fucko?

72
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:08,235
<i>He was a good guy. Crazy though.</i>

73
00:10:08,527 --> 00:10:10,237
Wanna know what Fenster told us?

74
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:13,907
- Said who?
- McManus. He told us another story.

75
00:10:14,199 --> 00:10:17,661
Was that the one about
the hooker with the dysentery?

76
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:20,747
<i>Fenster worked with McManus.</i>
<i>He was a tight-ass.</i>

77
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,292
<i>But when it came to the job,</i>
<i>he was right on. A smart man.</i>

78
00:10:24,543 --> 00:10:25,669
What are you saying?

79
00:10:25,961 --> 00:10:29,089
- I said he'll flip you.
- He'll what?

80
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,007
- Flip you for real.
- I'm shaking.

81
00:10:31,299 --> 00:10:33,301
Come on. Answer my question.

82
00:10:33,593 --> 00:10:35,137
Can you hear me in the back?

83
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:39,975
I want my lawyer.

84
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,978
I'm gonna have your fucking badge,
cocksucker.

85
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:46,022
<i>Todd Hockney. Good with explosives.</i>

86
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,776
<i>Without a doubt, the guy who</i>
<i>didn't give a fuck about anybody.</i>

87
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:52,237
You guys don't have a leg to stand on.

88
00:10:52,529 --> 00:10:56,199
I can put you in Queens
on the night of the hijacking.

89
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,659
Really?

90
00:10:57,993 --> 00:11:01,747
I live in Queens. Did you put that
together yourself, Einstein?

91
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:04,249
You got a team of monkeys
working on this?

92
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,669
You know what happens if you do
another turn in the joint?

93
00:11:09,755 --> 00:11:11,840
Fuck your father
and then have a snack.

94
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:15,427
- You gonna charge me?
- I'll charge you when I'm ready.

95
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:18,138
- With what?
- You know damn well, dead man.

96
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:22,059
<i>But Keaton? He was the real prize</i>
<i>for them, for obvious reasons.</i>

97
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,728
It was your mistake. Not mine.

98
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:29,983
Did you ever stop to ask me?

99
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:35,614
I mean, I been walking around
with the same face, the same name.

100
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,949
I'm a businessman.

101
00:11:38,241 --> 00:11:40,243
What's that?
The restaurant business?

102
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:44,164
From now on, you're in the
getting-fucked-by-us business.

103
00:11:44,456 --> 00:11:46,792
I'm gonna make you famous, cocksucker.

104
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:48,752
Like I said...

105
00:11:49,002 --> 00:11:52,172
...it was your mistake. Not mine.

106
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:55,842
Now, you charge me with this shit...

107
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:58,136
...and I'll beat it.

108
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,600
Let's get back to the truck, asshole.

109
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,065
Somebody's gotta do something.
I get hauled in every five minutes.

110
00:12:10,357 --> 00:12:13,402
So I did a little time.
Does that mean I get railed...

111
00:12:13,652 --> 00:12:18,156
...every time a truck finds its way
off the planet? Fuck them.

112
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:22,494
Fenster, will you relax? These guys
don't have any probable cause.

113
00:12:22,744 --> 00:12:24,830
You're fucking-A right. No P.C.

114
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,208
You're goddamn right.
You do some time, never let you go.

115
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,379
They treat me like a criminal,
I'll end up a criminal.

116
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,047
You are a criminal.

117
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,386
Now, why you gotta go and do that?
I'm trying to make a point.

118
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:44,266
Why don't you make your point?
You're making me tired all over.

119
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:45,684
Fuck it, then.

120
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:48,061
- I heard you were dead.
- Oh, yeah?

121
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:51,565
- You heard right.
- Word I got is you hung up your spurs.

122
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:54,693
- What's that all about?
- What's this?

123
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,195
Rumor is Keaton's gone straight.

124
00:12:57,988 --> 00:13:01,116
- I hear he's tapping Edie Finneran.
- Who's that?

125
00:13:01,408 --> 00:13:05,454
A heavyweight criminal lawyer.
I hear she's Keaton's meal ticket.

126
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,789
How about it, Keaton?

127
00:13:08,039 --> 00:13:09,875
You a lawyer's wife?

128
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,377
What retainer you giving her?

129
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,591
Hey, Fenster, do your friend a favor.

130
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:20,385
Tell him to keep quiet.

131
00:13:21,261 --> 00:13:23,221
Dean Keaton.

132
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:25,766
Gone clean, huh?

133
00:13:26,475 --> 00:13:28,060
Say it ain't so.

134
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,936
Or did you hit that truck?

135
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:33,857
Mac, Mac. Forget him.
Did you get to talk to your lawyer?

136
00:13:35,025 --> 00:13:36,818
This whole thing was a shakedown.

137
00:13:37,069 --> 00:13:40,530
- Why do you say that?
- How many times you been in a lineup?

138
00:13:41,573 --> 00:13:43,658
It's always you and four dummies.

139
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:47,162
P.D. pays homeless guys
10 bucks a head half the time.

140
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:50,665
There's no way they'd line
five felons in the same row.

141
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:54,336
A voice lineup? A public defender
could get you out of that.

142
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,338
So why was I strip-searched?

143
00:13:56,588 --> 00:13:58,215
It was the feds.

144
00:13:58,465 --> 00:14:00,550
A truckload of guns get snagged.

145
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:04,679
Customs comes down on NYPD
for answers. They come up with us.

146
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:08,058
- They're clutching at straws.
- A guy's finger was up my ass.

147
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,476
Is it Friday already?

148
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:12,813
Yeah, lover-boy.

149
00:14:13,063 --> 00:14:15,774
You want a piece?
Jump in. I'll love you.

150
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:19,528
So who are the goddamn pigs
who stole our fucking truck?

151
00:14:20,821 --> 00:14:23,824
- What did you say?
- Who stole the fucking truck?

152
00:14:24,074 --> 00:14:27,035
- I don't want to know.
- Who asked you, working man?

153
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,579
Fuck who did it.
I wanna know, who's the gimp?

154
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:33,625
- He's okay.
- Says you. What about it, pretzel man?

155
00:14:34,251 --> 00:14:35,710
His name is Verbal.

156
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:38,296
Verbal Kint.

157
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:42,634
Roger, really.
People say I talk too much.

158
00:14:42,884 --> 00:14:44,678
I was gonna tell you to shut up.

159
00:14:44,928 --> 00:14:46,680
We met before once or twice.

160
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,306
In county. I was in for fraud.

161
00:14:48,557 --> 00:14:50,726
You were in a lineup. What happened?

162
00:14:51,017 --> 00:14:53,770
I walked. 90 days suspended.

163
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:55,188
So you did it.

164
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,274
All right, now look.

165
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:01,027
We've all been put out
by this whole thing, right?

166
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,990
So I figure we owe it to ourselves
to salvage a little dignity.

167
00:15:05,532 --> 00:15:08,744
Now, me and Fenster heard
about a little job.

168
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,704
Why don't you just calm down?

169
00:15:11,163 --> 00:15:12,914
What do you care what he says?

170
00:15:14,082 --> 00:15:15,876
I'm just talking here.

171
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:21,590
It seems to me like Mr. Hockney wants
to hear it, and I know Fenster's down.

172
00:15:22,507 --> 00:15:24,176
What about you, guy?

173
00:15:25,552 --> 00:15:26,928
I'm interested. Sure.

174
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,473
There. See?

175
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:32,768
Now I'd like to exercise
my right to free assembly.

176
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:34,853
Why don't you just shut up?

177
00:15:40,984 --> 00:15:42,444
You're missing the point.

178
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,615
No. You're missing the point.

179
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:49,951
I don't wanna hear anything from you.

180
00:15:50,452 --> 00:15:52,579
I don't care about your job.

181
00:15:57,626 --> 00:16:00,045
I want nothing to do with any of you.

182
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:03,965
I beg your pardon,
but you can all go to hell.

183
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:07,844
Dean Keaton...

184
00:16:08,595 --> 00:16:10,180
...gone the high road.

185
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,017
What is the world coming to?

186
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,898
Fuck him.

187
00:16:24,736 --> 00:16:26,363
<i>And that was how it started.</i>

188
00:16:26,613 --> 00:16:31,118
<i>Us five being brought in on trumped-up</i>
<i>charges to be leaned on by half-wits.</i>

189
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:36,373
I really can't
talk about it much here.

190
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:40,085
<i>What the cops never figured out,</i>
<i>and what I know now...</i>

191
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:43,630
<i>...was that these men would</i>
<i>never break. Never lie down.</i>

192
00:16:44,548 --> 00:16:46,591
<i>Never bend over for anybody.</i>

193
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:49,052
<i>Anybody.</i>

194
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:05,861
Who are you?

195
00:17:06,153 --> 00:17:09,114
Agent Jack Baer, FBI. How many dead?

196
00:17:09,364 --> 00:17:12,617
Fifteen. They're still pulling
bodies out of the water.

197
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:15,370
- Any survivors?
- There's two.

198
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:17,956
One guy's in County Hospital
in a coma.

199
00:17:18,248 --> 00:17:21,293
The D.A. has the second guy,
a cripple from New York.

200
00:17:21,543 --> 00:17:23,670
The chief wants this place sealed off.

201
00:17:23,962 --> 00:17:26,381
If you have any questions,
give him a call.

202
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:04,127
<i>This is Dave Kujan.</i>
<i>I'll be in Los Angeles until Tuesday.</i>

203
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:06,463
<i>If you need me, contact Jeff Rabin...</i>

204
00:18:06,755 --> 00:18:11,343
<i>...of the San Pedro Police Department</i>
<i>at extension 112. Have a nice day.</i>

205
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:17,724
- Why can't I see him?
- I told you.

206
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:22,187
The D.A. was here ready to arraign
even before they moved him to county.

207
00:18:22,479 --> 00:18:25,232
Kint's lawyer shows up
five minutes later...

208
00:18:25,524 --> 00:18:28,735
...the D.A. comes out looking like
the bogeyman smacked him.

209
00:18:28,985 --> 00:18:32,072
They take his statement,
and they cut him a deal.

210
00:18:32,322 --> 00:18:34,783
- Did they charge him with anything?
- Weapons.

211
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,284
Misdemeanor two.

212
00:18:36,576 --> 00:18:37,911
What is that?

213
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,082
I give the D.A. credit for getting
that much. You understand?

214
00:18:42,374 --> 00:18:43,959
Excuse me, sir.

215
00:18:45,085 --> 00:18:47,129
This thing has turned political.

216
00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:49,840
The mayor was here last night,
the chief.

217
00:18:50,132 --> 00:18:52,134
This morning, the governor called.

218
00:18:52,426 --> 00:18:54,594
This guy is protected
from up on high...

219
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:57,723
...by the Prince of Darkness.
Take my word for it.

220
00:18:57,973 --> 00:19:00,267
- When does he post bail?
- Two hours, tops.

221
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,102
- I wanna see him.
- No, David.

222
00:19:02,394 --> 00:19:04,187
I gotta see him, Jeffrey.

223
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:07,607
You gotta do this for me.
I came a long way for this.

224
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,861
Dave, please.

225
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,033
Even if I let you talk to him,
he won't talk.

226
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:22,998
He's paranoid about being recorded.
He knows interrogation rooms are wired.

227
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:26,168
This won't be an interrogation.
Just a friendly chat.

228
00:19:26,418 --> 00:19:28,295
He won't go to
the interrogation room.

229
00:19:28,545 --> 00:19:30,672
- Then someplace else, then.
- Where?

230
00:19:33,925 --> 00:19:37,637
If this was a dope deal, where is it?
If it was a hit, who called it in?

231
00:19:37,888 --> 00:19:41,641
I'm sure you have wild theories
to answer all these questions.

232
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:44,728
- You know what I think.
- That's crazy.

233
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,731
He's got total immunity.
His story checks out.

234
00:19:47,981 --> 00:19:52,235
- He doesn't know what you wanna know.
- I don't think he does. Not exactly.

235
00:19:52,486 --> 00:19:55,322
There's a lot more to his story,
believe me.

236
00:19:55,572 --> 00:19:59,034
I wanna know why 27 men died
on that pier...

237
00:19:59,326 --> 00:20:03,622
...for what looks to be $91 million
worth of dope that wasn't there.

238
00:20:03,872 --> 00:20:07,292
And above all, I wanna be sure
Dean Keaton's dead.

239
00:20:07,793 --> 00:20:09,002
He's dead.

240
00:20:09,461 --> 00:20:12,381
Come on. Two hours.
Just till he makes bail.

241
00:20:13,006 --> 00:20:16,385
They're all dead. I don't care
how tough a guy Keaton was.

242
00:20:16,676 --> 00:20:19,554
Nobody on that boat could've
come out alive.

243
00:20:22,974 --> 00:20:26,561
- Is he talking?
- He regained consciousness and spoke.

244
00:20:26,853 --> 00:20:29,272
- Not English. Then he lapsed.
- Hungarian?

245
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:32,234
- I think so.
- Most of them were Hungarians.

246
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:36,154
- Put on one of these.
- Burn victims are subject to infection.

247
00:20:37,114 --> 00:20:39,699
And of course, there's no smoking.

248
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:51,795
Keep your mask up.
Don't touch him.

249
00:20:52,045 --> 00:20:52,963
Is he gonna die?

250
00:20:53,255 --> 00:20:55,674
He has burns over 60% of his body.

251
00:20:55,966 --> 00:20:58,468
Get a man on the door
till police get here.

252
00:20:58,719 --> 00:20:59,803
Is he dangerous?

253
00:21:00,053 --> 00:21:03,306
Yes. Do it. Do it now.

254
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:09,563
Joel? Yeah. Baer.
Down at L.A. County.

255
00:21:09,855 --> 00:21:13,859
Look, the guy they pulled out
of the harbor is Arkosh Kovash.

256
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:18,488
No, he's all fucked up.

257
00:21:19,865 --> 00:21:21,408
I can't hear you.

258
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,244
Will you shut up? I'm on the phone.

259
00:21:28,915 --> 00:21:30,459
Send me a Hungarian.

260
00:21:31,293 --> 00:21:33,086
He's talking like a Thai hooker.

261
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,592
Keyser Soze!

262
00:21:43,638 --> 00:21:45,015
No shit.

263
00:21:46,683 --> 00:21:49,561
Joel, call Dan Metzheiser
over at Justice...

264
00:21:49,811 --> 00:21:52,481
...and find Dave Kujan from Customs.

265
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:29,393
Verbal, this is Agent Kujan
from Customs.

266
00:22:30,143 --> 00:22:31,728
Nice to meet you.

267
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,649
- He wants to ask you a few questions.
- What about?

268
00:22:35,899 --> 00:22:37,734
About Dean Keaton, mostly.

269
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:41,279
But I'd like to start at the lineup.

270
00:22:41,571 --> 00:22:44,866
- Can I get some coffee?
- Let's talk about the lineup.

271
00:22:45,117 --> 00:22:48,412
I'm really thirsty.
I used to dehydrate as a kid.

272
00:22:48,703 --> 00:22:51,748
One time I got so bad
my piss come out like snot.

273
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,625
I'll get your coffee.

274
00:22:53,917 --> 00:22:55,877
Get me one too while you're at it.

275
00:23:00,966 --> 00:23:02,676
That guy is tense.

276
00:23:02,926 --> 00:23:04,386
Tension is a killer.

277
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,472
I used to be in a quartet
in Skokie, Illinois.

278
00:23:07,764 --> 00:23:11,518
The baritone was Kip Diskin.
Big, fat guy. I mean, orca fat.

279
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,186
He was so stressed...

280
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:15,313
You know we're trying to help you.

281
00:23:15,605 --> 00:23:17,399
Sure. And I appreciate that.

282
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:20,527
And I wanna help you, Agent Kujan.
I like cops.

283
00:23:20,819 --> 00:23:23,321
I would've liked to have been
a fed but...

284
00:23:23,572 --> 00:23:27,367
You're not telling us everything.
I know you know something.

285
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:29,870
<i>I told the D.A. everything I know.</i>

286
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:36,376
<i>Verbal, I know you like Keaton.</i>
<i>I know you think he's a good man.</i>

287
00:23:36,668 --> 00:23:39,379
- <i>I know he was good.</i>
- <i>He was a corrupt cop.</i>

288
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:42,424
<i>Sure, 15 years ago.</i>
<i>But he was a good thief.</i>

289
00:23:43,216 --> 00:23:45,052
The cops wouldn't let him go legit.

290
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:47,596
Dean Keaton was a piece of shit.

291
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:53,226
Are you trying to get a rise
out of me, Agent Kujan?

292
00:23:53,894 --> 00:23:55,437
I just wanna hear your story.

293
00:23:55,687 --> 00:23:56,980
It's all there.

294
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:59,483
May I have a cigarette?

295
00:24:02,694 --> 00:24:04,571
- According to...
- I need a light.

296
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:11,912
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

297
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:20,796
According to your statement,
you're a short-con operator.

298
00:24:22,631 --> 00:24:24,091
Run-of-the-mill scams.

299
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:26,510
That's been suppressed.
It's inadmissible.

300
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:27,844
I know.

301
00:24:28,136 --> 00:24:30,180
Sweet deal you have.
Total immunity.

302
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:34,351
Well, I do have the weapons charge.

303
00:24:34,643 --> 00:24:36,812
I'm looking at six whole months
hard time.

304
00:24:37,104 --> 00:24:38,980
You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer?

305
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:42,484
You know a religious guy
named John Paul?

306
00:24:42,734 --> 00:24:43,944
Ruby's in Attica.

307
00:24:44,194 --> 00:24:46,530
- He didn't have my lawyer.
- I know Ruby.

308
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,158
He's big on respect.
He's a good friend of mine.

309
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:52,202
I know your testimony's sealed.

310
00:24:52,452 --> 00:24:55,914
Ruby's got friends inside
who do a lot of favors for him.

311
00:24:56,206 --> 00:25:00,043
What would he say if he found out you
dropped his name to the D.A.?

312
00:25:00,293 --> 00:25:03,630
- There's nothing about Ruby.
- I'll mention that to him.

313
00:25:03,922 --> 00:25:06,675
First thing on the job,
I learned to spot a murderer.

314
00:25:06,967 --> 00:25:10,721
You arrest three guys for a killing.
You put them in jail overnight.

315
00:25:11,012 --> 00:25:13,098
Next day, whoever's sleeping
is your man.

316
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:16,768
If you're guilty, you know you're
caught. You let your guard down.

317
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,396
- You following me?
- No.

318
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,648
Let me get to the point.

319
00:25:22,816 --> 00:25:24,234
I'm smarter than you.

320
00:25:24,901 --> 00:25:27,362
And I'll find out
what I wanna know.

321
00:25:27,612 --> 00:25:29,448
And I'm gonna get it from you.

322
00:25:30,615 --> 00:25:32,492
I'm not a rat.

323
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,791
Thanks.

324
00:25:44,379 --> 00:25:47,549
When I picked beans in Guatemala,
we made fresh coffee.

325
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:49,384
Right off the trees, I mean.

326
00:25:49,634 --> 00:25:50,761
That was good.

327
00:25:51,053 --> 00:25:52,929
This is shit, but I'm at a police...

328
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,639
Can we get started again?

329
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:57,517
Now, what happened after the lineup?

330
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,901
The sergeant told me
he couldn't release you.

331
00:26:06,193 --> 00:26:09,029
Can you believe that?
You weren't even charged.

332
00:26:09,321 --> 00:26:10,864
Police!

333
00:26:13,617 --> 00:26:17,788
I wanna take pictures of your face.
I'll take them to the D.A.'s office.

334
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,039
Forget about it.

335
00:26:19,289 --> 00:26:21,708
I'll have this at the grand jury
by Monday.

336
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,960
I don't wanna talk about it, Edie.

337
00:26:26,963 --> 00:26:28,757
What did Fortier and Renault say?

338
00:26:29,549 --> 00:26:31,551
They asked for some more time.

339
00:26:31,802 --> 00:26:33,387
They just want more time.

340
00:26:33,637 --> 00:26:34,846
More time for what?

341
00:26:35,347 --> 00:26:38,725
No matter how you cover me,
they'll still find out about me.

342
00:26:39,226 --> 00:26:41,019
Give me some credit.

343
00:26:41,353 --> 00:26:42,354
I got you this far.

344
00:26:42,604 --> 00:26:45,232
Let's go to the grand jury.
This won't stop...

345
00:26:45,482 --> 00:26:47,776
It's never gonna stop, period.

346
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:52,155
By next week, every investor is
gonna be walking away from us.

347
00:26:53,907 --> 00:26:55,325
It's finished.

348
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:57,369
I'm finished.

349
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:05,293
Don't give up on me now, Dean.

350
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:09,256
It's never gonna stop.

351
00:27:16,346 --> 00:27:17,806
I love you.

352
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:21,476
They ruined me in there tonight.

353
00:27:23,061 --> 00:27:24,604
I love you.

354
00:27:25,981 --> 00:27:27,190
Do you hear me?

355
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:35,449
What?

356
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,330
Let's just go to my place.

357
00:27:57,721 --> 00:27:59,681
We'll worry about this tomorrow.

358
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:05,479
Let's go.

359
00:28:07,898 --> 00:28:10,400
<i>Fenster and McManus had</i>
<i>a cagey proposition.</i>

360
00:28:10,692 --> 00:28:13,445
<i>A fast jump. High risk, long money.</i>

361
00:28:13,737 --> 00:28:15,322
<i>We all knew it could be done.</i>

362
00:28:15,614 --> 00:28:18,241
<i>I figured to do it wrong</i>
<i>meant killing.</i>

363
00:28:18,533 --> 00:28:20,744
<i>To do it right took five men.</i>

364
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:22,996
<i>Five men meant Keaton.</i>

365
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:26,458
<i>Keaton took convincing.</i>

366
00:28:28,668 --> 00:28:30,921
New York's Finest Taxi Service.

367
00:28:31,671 --> 00:28:33,048
Bullshit.

368
00:28:33,757 --> 00:28:35,300
Bullshit.

369
00:28:36,343 --> 00:28:38,261
They don't operate anymore.

370
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:42,599
McManus has a friend in the 14th
precinct. They're doing one job.

371
00:28:42,849 --> 00:28:45,227
They're picking up a guy
smuggling emeralds.

372
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,438
- McManus already has a fence set.
- A fence? Who?

373
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:51,983
- Some guy in California. Redfoot.
- I never heard of him.

374
00:28:52,275 --> 00:28:53,360
You have to come.

375
00:28:53,652 --> 00:28:58,073
- What's it to you whether I do or not?
- They don't know me. You do.

376
00:28:58,365 --> 00:29:00,534
They won't take me unless you go.

377
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:03,662
- Look at me. I need this.
- Tough.

378
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:07,416
You're telling me you don't need this?
Is this your place?

379
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:11,586
You look like you got a good
little scam going with this lawyer.

380
00:29:15,841 --> 00:29:17,050
Sorry.

381
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,302
It's okay.

382
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:23,473
You say it's the real thing.
That's cool.

383
00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:27,644
You okay?

384
00:29:27,978 --> 00:29:29,521
I was out of line.

385
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,108
But they'll never stop with us.
You know that.

386
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,819
As clean as you get,
they won't let you go.

387
00:29:36,111 --> 00:29:40,157
This way, we hit the cops where it
hurts, and we get well in the meantime.

388
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,996
You're sure you're okay?

389
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,831
I'll be all right.

390
00:30:04,473 --> 00:30:06,641
- I sometimes get...
- Forget it.

391
00:30:10,228 --> 00:30:12,481
I'll probably shit blood tonight.

392
00:30:27,496 --> 00:30:29,164
How do they wanna do it?

393
00:30:30,874 --> 00:30:34,002
McManus wants to go in shooting.
I say no.

394
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,297
Fenster? Hockney?

395
00:30:37,547 --> 00:30:40,217
They're pretty pissed off.
They'll do anything.

396
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:43,470
I got a way to do it
without killing anyone...

397
00:30:43,762 --> 00:30:46,056
...but they won't let me in
without you.

398
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,867
Three million?

399
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,204
Maybe more.

400
00:31:13,625 --> 00:31:15,043
No killing?

401
00:31:16,712 --> 00:31:19,005
Not if we do it my way.

402
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:55,667
<i>New York's Finest Taxi Service</i>
<i>wasn't a normal taxi.</i>

403
00:31:55,917 --> 00:31:59,963
<i>It was a ring of corrupt cops</i>
<i>that ran a high-profit racket...</i>

404
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:02,340
<i>...driving smugglers</i>
<i>around the city.</i>

405
00:32:02,591 --> 00:32:05,927
<i>For a few hundred dollars a mile,</i>
<i>you got a police escort.</i>

406
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:08,013
<i>They even had business cards.</i>

407
00:32:08,263 --> 00:32:12,225
<i>Somebody started asking questions,</i>
<i>and the Taxi Service shut down.</i>

408
00:32:12,517 --> 00:32:15,979
<i>Internal Affairs has been waiting</i>
<i>to catch them in the act.</i>

409
00:32:16,271 --> 00:32:17,856
<i>That's where we came in.</i>

410
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:21,193
- So how was the flight?
- Fucking great.

411
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:25,322
Will this get me to Staten Island?

412
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:28,950
You kidding me? This'll get you
to Cape Cod.

413
00:32:29,201 --> 00:32:32,120
<i>McManus came to us with the job.</i>
<i>Fenster got the vans.</i>

414
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,663
<i>Hockney, the hardware.</i>

415
00:32:33,914 --> 00:32:36,333
<i>I figured out how to do it</i>
<i>so no one died.</i>

416
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:39,961
<i>But Keaton, Keaton put on</i>

417
00:32:40,253 --> 00:32:44,132
<i>A little "fuck you" from</i>

418
00:32:46,802 --> 00:32:49,304
All right, watch this. Watch this.

419
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:50,722
Careful, careful!

420
00:32:50,972 --> 00:32:51,807
Come on, asshole.

421
00:32:54,017 --> 00:32:55,769
Holy shit!

422
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:57,646
Don't move, you fuckers!

423
00:32:57,938 --> 00:32:59,398
Drop it now, motherfucker.

424
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,025
Drop the fucking gun. Drop it.

425
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,654
What do you guys want?

426
00:33:05,904 --> 00:33:08,281
I'm a fucking cop, you stupid asshole!

427
00:33:08,824 --> 00:33:10,033
Watch the glass!

428
00:33:11,618 --> 00:33:14,329
- You want a buckshot shampoo, chubby?
- Shut up!

429
00:33:16,498 --> 00:33:17,833
Oh, fuck.

430
00:33:21,128 --> 00:33:24,214
Good afternoon, my little pork chops.
Give me the shit.

431
00:33:24,464 --> 00:33:25,716
Give him the shit!

432
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:29,052
Give him the fucking shit, man!

433
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:31,847
Hurry up! Come on!

434
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,558
- Now the money.
- There's no money.

435
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:36,351
There's no fucking money.

436
00:33:37,352 --> 00:33:38,770
Give him the money.

437
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:42,274
Do it! Give him the money!
Give him the money!

438
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:43,942
Hurry up!

439
00:33:44,985 --> 00:33:46,862
Motherfucker, you know who I am?

440
00:33:47,154 --> 00:33:50,031
Do you people know who the fuck I am?
Fuck!

441
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:52,284
We do now, jerkoff.

442
00:33:59,166 --> 00:34:01,251
Wait a minute. What's that?

443
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,588
What the fuck...?

444
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:06,506
Holy shit!

445
00:34:23,398 --> 00:34:25,067
<i>Keaton made an anonymous call.</i>

446
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:27,569
<i>The press was there</i>
<i>before the police.</i>

447
00:34:27,861 --> 00:34:30,238
<i>Strausz and Rizzi were</i>

450
00:34:37,412 --> 00:34:39,206
<i>It was beautiful.</i>

451
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,049
I owe you $2.50.

452
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,802
Dr. Keaton.

453
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:57,974
- There's more than I thought.
- When's the fence coming?

454
00:34:58,392 --> 00:35:01,728
Redfoot never comes to see me.
I always go to see him.

455
00:35:02,437 --> 00:35:03,939
In California?

456
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:07,442
Yes, Verbal, in California.
Fenster and I...

457
00:35:07,692 --> 00:35:09,486
Wait. Hold the fucking phone.

458
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:12,030
You and Fenster? No, no, no.

459
00:35:12,489 --> 00:35:13,657
You kidding me?

460
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:16,618
Okay, so everyone's gonna go?

461
00:35:17,035 --> 00:35:18,620
We all go.

462
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,165
What's your fucking problem, man?

463
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:25,961
My problem is that you and Fenster are
off in California...

464
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,839
...while we're sitting here
holding our dicks.

465
00:35:29,381 --> 00:35:31,133
The job's over.

466
00:35:31,466 --> 00:35:32,801
Cool it.

467
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,929
L.A.'s a good place to lay low
for a while.

468
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,183
You wanna dance?

469
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:49,067
Ladies.

470
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,702
I'd like to propose a toast.

471
00:36:00,162 --> 00:36:01,788
There you go.

472
00:36:04,207 --> 00:36:05,959
To Mr. Verbal...

473
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:09,504
...the man with the plan.

474
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:24,227
<i>We'll miss the flight.</i>

475
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:28,273
Don't do this.
Send her a note, something.

476
00:36:29,149 --> 00:36:30,984
I said we'll make it.

477
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,645
We're gonna miss the plane.

478
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,190
She'll understand.

479
00:37:29,418 --> 00:37:30,961
That's heartwarming.

480
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:32,504
Really.

481
00:37:34,005 --> 00:37:35,424
I'm weepy.

482
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:38,552
Jeff, you wanna wait outside?

483
00:37:41,888 --> 00:37:44,725
You wanted to know
what happened after the lineup.

484
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:46,393
Come on, Verbal.

485
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,770
Who do you think you're talking to?

486
00:37:49,104 --> 00:37:51,898
Do you expect me to believe
that he retired?

487
00:37:52,441 --> 00:37:53,984
For a woman?

488
00:37:55,777 --> 00:37:58,697
Bullshit. Keaton was using her.

489
00:37:58,947 --> 00:38:01,158
- He loved her.
- Sure.

490
00:38:01,408 --> 00:38:04,327
<i>Hitting the Taxi Service</i>
<i>wasn't his idea?</i>

491
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,121
<i>It was Fenster and McManus.</i>

492
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:10,250
<i>Keaton was a cop for four years.</i>
<i>Who knew the Taxi Service better?</i>

493
00:38:10,542 --> 00:38:13,420
- <i>That job was his.</i>
- <i>But Edie had him turned around.</i>

494
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:15,464
Let me tell you something.

495
00:38:15,714 --> 00:38:17,132
I know Dean Keaton.

496
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:19,968
I've been investigating him
for three years.

497
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:22,971
The guy I knew was
a cold-blooded bastard.

498
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:27,350
I.A. indicted him on 3 counts of murder
before he was kicked off the force.

499
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:29,519
He's not the hooker
with the heart of gold.

500
00:38:29,978 --> 00:38:31,480
You got him all wrong.

501
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:33,815
Do I?

502
00:38:34,316 --> 00:38:38,570
Dean Keaton was under indictment
seven times while he was on the force.

503
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,282
In every case, witnesses
either reversed their testimony...

504
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,285
...or died before they could testify.

505
00:38:45,952 --> 00:38:47,788
They finally nailed him
for fraud.

506
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,459
He spent five years in Sing Sing.
He killed three prisoners inside.

507
00:38:52,918 --> 00:38:55,712
Of course, I can't prove this.

508
00:38:56,463 --> 00:38:59,049
But I can't prove
the best part either.

509
00:39:00,384 --> 00:39:04,471
Dean Keaton was dead.
Did you know that?

510
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:06,598
He died in a fire two years ago...

511
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,645
...during a murder investigation of a
witness who would testify against him.

512
00:39:11,895 --> 00:39:16,775
Two people saw Dean Keaton walk into
a warehouse just before it blew up.

513
00:39:17,067 --> 00:39:20,320
They said he went in to check
a leaking gas main.

514
00:39:20,862 --> 00:39:24,741
It blew up and took
all of Dean Keaton with it.

515
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:27,661
Within three months
of the explosion...

516
00:39:27,953 --> 00:39:30,330
...the two witnesses, they were dead.

517
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:32,624
One killed himself in his car...

518
00:39:32,874 --> 00:39:35,961
...the other fell down
an open elevator shaft.

519
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:40,757
Let's get this show on the road.

520
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:43,051
There are far too many people...

521
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:46,179
We'll be out of here
before he blows his porch light.

522
00:39:46,471 --> 00:39:48,807
- I have a noon meeting.
- Five minutes.

523
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:50,809
Everyone just calm down.

524
00:39:51,101 --> 00:39:54,688
I want you to ask this man
about the shootout in the harbor.

525
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:09,578
- He says they were buying...
- Dope. We know.

526
00:40:15,292 --> 00:40:19,254
He doesn't know what they were buying,
but not dope. People.

527
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,589
What?

528
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:29,973
He needs guarantees...

529
00:40:30,223 --> 00:40:33,518
- What's he talking about?
- He says his life is in danger.

530
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:38,231
He saw the devil,
looked him in the eye.

531
00:40:38,523 --> 00:40:40,859
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, wait a minute.

532
00:40:41,151 --> 00:40:43,987
Ask him to tell him what he told me.

533
00:40:44,446 --> 00:40:46,031
About the devil.

534
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,908
Who's the devil?

535
00:40:53,372 --> 00:40:55,290
Keyser Soze.

536
00:40:59,711 --> 00:41:00,837
Keyser Soze?

537
00:41:01,129 --> 00:41:04,549
He was in the harbor killing many men.

538
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,094
He saw Keyser Soze?

539
00:41:13,016 --> 00:41:14,017
He saw his face.

540
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:18,563
All right, look. Tell him
to tell her what he looks like.

541
00:41:18,814 --> 00:41:20,232
Describe him.

542
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:30,367
<i>Six weeks ago, I get a call</i>
<i>saying I can find Keaton...</i>

543
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:33,620
<i>...eating at Mondino's</i>
<i>with his attorney. There he is.</i>

544
00:41:34,246 --> 00:41:37,165
Because he never profited
from his alleged death...

545
00:41:37,457 --> 00:41:40,877
...and we convicted someone else
of the murder...

546
00:41:41,128 --> 00:41:42,754
...we had to let him go.

547
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:46,717
He was dead long enough
for the murder rap to blow over.

548
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,593
And then he had lunch.

549
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:50,721
I don't know about that.

550
00:41:51,012 --> 00:41:52,764
I don't think you do.

551
00:41:53,181 --> 00:41:55,475
But you say you saw Keaton die.

552
00:41:55,767 --> 00:41:58,395
You're covering him,
and he's still out there.

553
00:41:58,687 --> 00:42:00,689
He's behind the circus
at the harbor.

554
00:42:00,981 --> 00:42:04,359
He's using your stupidity.
You think he's your friend.

555
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:07,154
You tell me he's dead, so be it.

556
00:42:07,904 --> 00:42:09,990
I wanna be sure he's dead.

557
00:42:10,282 --> 00:42:12,993
He wasn't behind anything.
It was the lawyer.

558
00:42:13,744 --> 00:42:15,078
What lawyer?

559
00:42:15,954 --> 00:42:16,747
What lawyer?

560
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:19,916
When I was in that quartet
in Skokie, Illinois...

561
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:22,210
I know you held out on the D.A.!

562
00:42:22,502 --> 00:42:26,173
What did you leave out of that
testimony? I can phone Ruby Deemer.

563
00:42:26,465 --> 00:42:29,176
- The D.A. gave me immunity.
- Not from me.

564
00:42:29,468 --> 00:42:31,720
You get no immunity from me.

565
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:35,223
Every criminal I've put in prison
or cop who owes me...

566
00:42:35,474 --> 00:42:39,311
...every creep that works the street
will know the name of Verbal Kint.

567
00:42:39,603 --> 00:42:43,148
You talk to me or that immunity
they deem so fit to grant you...

568
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:47,194
...won't be worth the paper the
contract on your life is printed on.

569
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:51,573
There was a lawyer.

570
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:54,493
Kobayashi.

571
00:42:55,327 --> 00:42:57,454
- Was he the one that killed Keaton?
- No.

572
00:42:57,746 --> 00:43:00,332
But I'm sure Keaton is dead.

573
00:43:00,624 --> 00:43:02,209
Convince me.

574
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:04,920
And tell me every last detail.

575
00:43:24,314 --> 00:43:28,276
<i>We arrived in Los Angeles and met</i>
<i>McManus' fence, Redfoot.</i>

576
00:43:28,735 --> 00:43:32,155
<i>He had a good reputation.</i>
<i>Seemed like a good guy.</i>

577
00:43:32,447 --> 00:43:34,366
<i>Still, we should've known better.</i>

578
00:43:34,658 --> 00:43:35,450
How you doing?

579
00:43:35,784 --> 00:43:39,162
- Good. You?
- Not bad. Can't complain.

580
00:43:39,538 --> 00:43:41,206
How's it going, Fenster?

581
00:43:42,374 --> 00:43:44,126
No need to open it, right?

582
00:43:50,424 --> 00:43:52,050
You must be Keaton.

583
00:43:53,093 --> 00:43:54,928
Redfoot, Dean Keaton.

584
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:59,349
- Todd Hockney and Verbal Kint.
- Verbal, the man with a plan, huh?

585
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,518
Interested in any more work?

586
00:44:02,602 --> 00:44:05,313
- We're always looking for work.
- We're on vacation.

587
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:08,024
Oh, well. That's too bad.

588
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,027
I got a ton of work
and no good people.

589
00:44:11,528 --> 00:44:13,280
- Not like you guys.
- What's the job?

590
00:44:13,613 --> 00:44:16,408
There's this jeweler out of Texas
named Saul.

591
00:44:16,658 --> 00:44:18,702
He rents a suite
in a downtown hotel.

592
00:44:18,952 --> 00:44:22,414
He does appraisals. Sometimes
he buys, sometimes he doesn't.

593
00:44:22,664 --> 00:44:25,292
The word is, he carries around
a lot of cash.

594
00:44:25,959 --> 00:44:30,088
So I figure I keep the merchandise,
you keep the green.

595
00:44:30,505 --> 00:44:32,632
- It's simple.
- What about security?

596
00:44:32,924 --> 00:44:35,844
A couple of bodyguards.
Nothing you couldn't handle.

597
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:38,346
Give me time to check it out?

598
00:44:38,638 --> 00:44:40,849
I expect nothing less from you, man.

599
00:44:42,184 --> 00:44:44,061
Good to see you. We'll call you.

600
00:44:44,478 --> 00:44:47,314
Enjoy L.A. Get yourself laid.

601
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:56,073
A friend of mine in New York tells me
that you knew Spook Hollis.

602
00:44:57,032 --> 00:45:00,035
The way I hear it,
you did time with old Spook.

603
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:01,912
Good man, wasn't he?

604
00:45:02,537 --> 00:45:04,623
I used to run dope for him.

605
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:06,917
Too bad he got shivved.

606
00:45:09,544 --> 00:45:10,545
I shivved him.

607
00:45:13,048 --> 00:45:16,510
Better you hear it from me now,
than from somebody else later.

608
00:45:18,053 --> 00:45:19,679
I appreciate that.

609
00:45:21,223 --> 00:45:22,641
Just out of curiosity...

610
00:45:23,183 --> 00:45:26,311
...was it business or personal?

611
00:45:28,313 --> 00:45:29,189
A bit of both.

612
00:45:31,233 --> 00:45:32,984
Like I said...

613
00:45:33,443 --> 00:45:35,695
...give me a call
if you're interested.

614
00:45:40,367 --> 00:45:41,952
Is there a problem?

615
00:45:43,745 --> 00:45:45,205
One job.

616
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,165
That was the deal.

617
00:45:52,295 --> 00:45:53,839
One job?

618
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:58,218
One job!

619
00:45:59,553 --> 00:46:01,555
That's a good one, Keaton.

620
00:46:03,765 --> 00:46:07,227
<i>Keaton fought it,</i>
<i>but a man can't change what he is.</i>

621
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:10,397
<i>He can convince anyone he's</i>
<i>someone else, but never himself.</i>

622
00:46:10,647 --> 00:46:14,276
<i>It took one day with McManus nagging,</i>
<i>and we went back to work.</i>

623
00:46:28,957 --> 00:46:31,209
I get out of my car
and it's wrecked.

624
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:34,755
I look in the back seat of the car,
and this woman is naked.

625
00:46:35,047 --> 00:46:36,798
I'm laughing so hard!

626
00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:38,175
Get in the car, Saul.

627
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:41,011
Freeze, motherfucker!
Right there!

628
00:46:41,261 --> 00:46:42,637
Here we go.

629
00:46:48,727 --> 00:46:52,022
Give me the case.
Give me the fucking case!

630
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,571
Give me the fucking case.

631
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:03,617
I'm telling you for the last time,
give me the fucking case!

632
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,332
Come on! Hey, don't move.

633
00:47:46,034 --> 00:47:47,828
Just hand over the case.

634
00:47:48,829 --> 00:47:51,039
Hand over the fucking case.

635
00:48:14,855 --> 00:48:16,481
Come on, let's go!

636
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:20,485
- Come on!
- Bad day. Fuck it.

637
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:22,112
Let's go, let's go!

638
00:48:46,178 --> 00:48:47,637
Fuck!

639
00:48:50,348 --> 00:48:54,019
Looks like a lot of China to me.
Shit.

640
00:48:59,441 --> 00:49:01,318
Guys, come on.

641
00:49:02,486 --> 00:49:04,696
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna kill him.

642
00:49:04,988 --> 00:49:06,573
We're gonna do it my way.

643
00:49:06,823 --> 00:49:09,034
- You gonna kill him?
- I'll deal with him.

644
00:49:09,326 --> 00:49:12,579
- You better deal with him.
- I'll deal with him. Shut up.

645
00:49:19,336 --> 00:49:20,754
What do I do with that?

646
00:49:22,297 --> 00:49:25,092
I don't know. Feed it to the gimp.
Ease his pain.

647
00:49:25,384 --> 00:49:27,677
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

648
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:30,847
- I got thrown this job by some lawyer.
- Who?

649
00:49:31,098 --> 00:49:33,058
I don't know. Some limey.

650
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:36,603
He's a middleman for someone.
He doesn't say, I don't ask.

651
00:49:36,895 --> 00:49:39,314
- You're fucking full of shit.
- Fuck you.

652
00:49:39,648 --> 00:49:42,401
Listen to me. We wanna meet him.

653
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,320
That's funny.

654
00:49:45,862 --> 00:49:48,490
He called me.
Says he wants to meet you guys.

655
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:52,828
- We'll meet him.
- I'll call.

656
00:49:53,078 --> 00:49:56,581
- Good. Do that. No problem.
- I don't like it. Wait a minute.

657
00:49:56,832 --> 00:49:57,999
One more thing...

658
00:49:58,542 --> 00:50:01,169
...any more surprises,
and I'm gonna kill you.

659
00:50:02,629 --> 00:50:04,297
You're such a tough guy.

660
00:50:04,548 --> 00:50:08,468
Do me a favor, all right?
Get the fuck off my dick.

661
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:12,723
Better put a leash on that puppy.

662
00:50:14,766 --> 00:50:18,437
You know, it's an awful shame
about Saul getting whacked.

663
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:21,606
Cops will be looking
for the guys who did it.

664
00:50:22,107 --> 00:50:24,568
Sooner or later,
they'll come asking me.

665
00:50:26,987 --> 00:50:29,114
You have a sweet night, ladies.

666
00:50:33,118 --> 00:50:34,536
Fuck you.

667
00:50:40,709 --> 00:50:41,835
So this lawyer...

668
00:50:42,127 --> 00:50:43,712
Kobayashi.

669
00:50:44,337 --> 00:50:46,757
...came from Redfoot.
- Right.

670
00:50:47,049 --> 00:50:49,551
Why leave this out
when you talked to the D.A.?

671
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:52,054
Dave, someone to see you.

672
00:50:55,307 --> 00:50:56,641
Jack.

673
00:50:57,684 --> 00:50:59,352
I been looking all over for you.

674
00:50:59,686 --> 00:51:03,023
You still after that coke
that took a walk from the bloodbath?

675
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:06,026
Well, you can stop looking.
There was no coke.

676
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:11,406
I been talking to a guy they pulled
out of a drainpipe after the shootout.

677
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:13,575
He came to. He started talking.

678
00:51:13,867 --> 00:51:17,788
He's part of a Hungarian mob dealing
with some goats from Argentina.

679
00:51:18,038 --> 00:51:20,916
- He says it wasn't a dope deal.
- But the 91 million...

680
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,959
Our man says no way on the dope.

681
00:51:23,251 --> 00:51:26,922
He tells me the bunch was pulling
stumps for Turkey the next day.

682
00:51:27,172 --> 00:51:30,467
They had no time to negotiate,
no means to move it.

683
00:51:30,759 --> 00:51:32,677
- What's the money for?
- He didn't know.

684
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:35,639
No one doing the deal knew,
except a few people.

685
00:51:35,931 --> 00:51:38,183
They were very hush about it,
he says.

686
00:51:38,475 --> 00:51:41,019
Whatever it was,
it was very sensitive.

687
00:51:41,269 --> 00:51:42,521
I don't get it.

688
00:51:42,813 --> 00:51:45,023
You got the cripple in there
from New York.

689
00:51:45,315 --> 00:51:47,484
- Did he mention Keyser Soze?
- Who?

690
00:51:48,777 --> 00:51:50,654
Just bear with me here.

691
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,824
Who's Keyser Soze?

692
00:51:54,116 --> 00:51:55,367
Fuck!

693
00:51:55,951 --> 00:51:59,413
We've been going over this
for an hour and a half.

694
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:03,291
What we need to do is find Redfoot
and get out of here now.

695
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:05,877
What we need to do is think.

696
00:52:06,169 --> 00:52:07,337
Think back.

697
00:52:08,296 --> 00:52:11,091
Somebody with power...

698
00:52:11,633 --> 00:52:14,553
...who was capable of tracking us
from New York to L.A.

699
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:18,140
- What the hell are we doing here?
- We're waiting.

700
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:19,683
Sit down.

701
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:22,144
No. It's hot, and I'm fucking bored.

702
00:52:22,436 --> 00:52:24,646
Mr. Hockney, do stay.

703
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,314
Mr. Keaton.

704
00:52:26,773 --> 00:52:30,819
Mr. Fenster, I recognize from
his mug shots, as well as Mr. McManus.

705
00:52:31,111 --> 00:52:33,196
I can only assume
that you are Mr. Kint...

706
00:52:33,488 --> 00:52:35,907
...the gentleman who disposed
of Saul Berg.

707
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:40,537
My employer sends his gratitude.
A most unexpected benefit.

708
00:52:41,038 --> 00:52:42,622
I am Mr. Kobayashi.

709
00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:47,502
I have been asked by my employer
to bring a proposal to you gentlemen.

710
00:52:47,794 --> 00:52:50,881
- What do you want?
- My employer requires your services.

711
00:52:53,008 --> 00:52:54,092
One job.

712
00:52:54,384 --> 00:52:56,470
One day's work. Very dangerous.

713
00:52:56,762 --> 00:53:00,182
He doesn't expect all of you to live,
but those who do...

714
00:53:00,432 --> 00:53:04,269
...will have $91 million to divide
between you in any way you see fit.

715
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:05,395
Who's your boss?

716
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:10,067
I work for Keyser Soze.

717
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:22,245
Who's Keyser Soze?

718
00:53:22,537 --> 00:53:27,417
Judging by the sudden change in mood,
I'm sure your associates can tell you.

719
00:53:28,335 --> 00:53:31,213
I come with an offer
directly from Mr. Soze.

720
00:53:31,505 --> 00:53:32,839
An order, actually.

721
00:53:33,131 --> 00:53:35,217
What do you mean, "an order"?

722
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:37,761
In 1981, Mr. Keaton,
you participated...

723
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:40,806
...in the hijacking of a truck
in Buffalo, New York.

724
00:53:41,056 --> 00:53:44,351
The cargo was raw steel.
Steel which belonged to Mr. Soze...

725
00:53:44,643 --> 00:53:48,688
...and which was destined for Pakistan
to be used in a nuclear reactor.

726
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,858
A most profitable violation
of UN regulations.

727
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:54,152
You had no way of knowing this.

728
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:57,406
The man shipping the steel
was working for Mr. Soze...

729
00:53:57,656 --> 00:53:59,116
...without his knowledge.

730
00:53:59,408 --> 00:54:01,952
Earlier this year,
Mr. Fenster and Mr. McManus...

731
00:54:02,244 --> 00:54:05,789
...hijacked a two-prop cargo flight
out of Newark airport.

732
00:54:06,081 --> 00:54:10,419
The plane was carrying gold and
platinum wiring, also set for Pakistan.

733
00:54:11,002 --> 00:54:12,254
Two months ago...

734
00:54:12,546 --> 00:54:16,842
...Mr. Hockney stole a truck
carrying gun parts through Queens.

735
00:54:17,134 --> 00:54:20,637
Gun parts which were set to be
destroyed by the state of New York.

736
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:24,558
They were to be lost in a way station
and re-routed to Belfast.

737
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:27,853
Again, Mr. Soze using pawns
who had no knowledge.

738
00:54:28,103 --> 00:54:30,689
Which brings us to Mr. Kint.

739
00:54:31,523 --> 00:54:35,610
Nine months ago, one of Mr. Soze's
less-than-intelligent couriers...

740
00:54:35,861 --> 00:54:40,365
...was taken in a complicated
confidence scam by a cripple.

741
00:54:41,283 --> 00:54:44,202
He was relieved of $62,000.

742
00:54:44,453 --> 00:54:47,497
Now, it has taken us some time
to find you.

743
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:51,501
Our intention was to approach you
after your apprehension in New York.

744
00:54:51,752 --> 00:54:52,919
You set up the lineup.

745
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:56,089
You were not to be released
until I had come to see you.

746
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:59,426
It seems Mr. Keaton's attorney,
Miss Finneran...

747
00:54:59,676 --> 00:55:01,720
...was a little too effective...

748
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:05,557
...in expediting his release. Holding
the rest was a moot point.

749
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:08,685
- What about Redfoot?
- Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.

750
00:55:08,935 --> 00:55:11,271
Mr. Soze rarely works with
the same people.

751
00:55:11,563 --> 00:55:13,315
They never know
who they work for.

752
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:17,736
One cannot be betrayed
if one has no people.

753
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,530
So why are you telling us?

754
00:55:20,781 --> 00:55:25,619
Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze,
Mr. Fenster. All of you.

755
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:29,748
That you did not know you did
is the only reason you're still alive.

756
00:55:30,207 --> 00:55:31,667
He feels you owe him.

757
00:55:31,959 --> 00:55:34,002
You will repay your debt.

758
00:55:34,378 --> 00:55:38,215
Fuck the debt and fuck you.
How do we know you work for Soze?

759
00:55:38,674 --> 00:55:41,343
I don't think that is very relevant,
Mr. Hockney.

760
00:55:41,593 --> 00:55:46,181
You all are responsible for the murder
of Saul Berg and his bodyguards.

761
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:50,561
Mr. Redfoot can testify to your
involvement. We can see that he will.

762
00:55:50,853 --> 00:55:52,020
What's your point?

763
00:55:52,312 --> 00:55:54,022
The offer is this, gentlemen.

764
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:58,068
Mr. Soze's primary interest
is narcotics.

765
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,196
He has been competing,
shall we say...

766
00:56:01,446 --> 00:56:03,490
...with Argentineans
for years now.

767
00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:06,994
Competing with Mr. Soze has
taken its toll.

768
00:56:07,494 --> 00:56:10,873
These Argentineans are negotiating
the sale...

769
00:56:11,123 --> 00:56:14,084
...of $91 million in cocaine
in three days' time.

770
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:17,129
Needless to say,
this purchase will revitalize...

771
00:56:17,421 --> 00:56:20,549
...the diminishing strength
of their organization.

772
00:56:20,841 --> 00:56:24,344
Mr. Soze would like you
to stop the deal.

773
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:27,848
If you choose, you may wait
until after the buy.

774
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,767
Whatever money changes hands is yours.

775
00:56:31,602 --> 00:56:36,607
Mr. Soze would like you to get to the
boat and destroy the cocaine onboard.

776
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:41,820
And then you will be free
of your obligations to Mr. Soze.

777
00:56:43,322 --> 00:56:47,242
You give me one good reason why
I shouldn't kill you right now.

778
00:56:48,827 --> 00:56:51,288
A gift from Mr. Soze.

779
00:56:54,666 --> 00:56:56,460
Good day, gentlemen.

780
00:58:05,737 --> 00:58:08,949
They got my whole life in here.
Everything I've ever done.

781
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:10,826
They know everything.

782
00:58:11,493 --> 00:58:14,288
Everybody I've ever worked with
or did time with.

783
00:58:32,139 --> 00:58:34,099
- This isn't right.
- I don't know.

784
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:37,352
Who's that guy used to talk about Soze
in New York?

785
00:58:39,104 --> 00:58:40,189
Bricks Marlin.

786
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:43,525
Yeah, he did jobs for him.
Indirect stuff.

787
00:58:43,817 --> 00:58:46,695
He made five times more money
than it was worth.

788
00:58:48,238 --> 00:58:52,284
This guy's a pipe dream. Kobayashi's
using him for window-dressing.

789
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:54,453
I don't know. This is bad.

790
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:58,749
No, it's bullshit. This guy
could be LAPD. It's a fucking setup.

791
00:58:59,541 --> 00:59:02,544
The way I hear it,
Soze's some kind of a butcher.

792
00:59:02,795 --> 00:59:04,922
A peerless, psycho, fucked-up butcher.

793
00:59:05,214 --> 00:59:07,132
There is no Keyser Soze!

794
00:59:09,885 --> 00:59:11,970
Who is Keyser Soze?

795
00:59:12,638 --> 00:59:14,056
He's supposed to be Turkish.

796
00:59:14,348 --> 00:59:16,308
Some say his father was German.

797
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:18,602
Nobody ever believed he was real.

798
00:59:18,852 --> 00:59:21,897
Nobody knew him or saw anybody
that worked directly for him.

799
00:59:22,147 --> 00:59:24,900
To hear Kobayashi tell it,
anybody could've worked for him.

800
00:59:25,192 --> 00:59:28,195
You never knew. That was his power.

801
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:32,282
The greatest trick
the devil ever pulled...

802
00:59:32,574 --> 00:59:35,702
...was convincing the world
he didn't exist.

803
00:59:37,037 --> 00:59:39,498
One story the guys told me,
the story I believe...

804
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:41,333
...was from his days in Turkey.

805
00:59:41,583 --> 00:59:44,086
A gang of Hungarians
wanted their own mob.

806
00:59:44,378 --> 00:59:46,171
They realized that to be in power...

807
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:49,174
...you didn't need guns or money
or even numbers.

808
00:59:49,466 --> 00:59:53,053
You just needed the will to do
what the other guy wouldn't.

809
00:59:53,345 --> 00:59:56,431
After a while, they come into power.
They went after Soze.

810
00:59:56,682 --> 00:59:59,893
He was smalltime then.
Just running dope, they say.

811
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:05,315
They come to his home
in the afternoon...

812
01:00:05,607 --> 01:00:07,067
<i>...looking for his business.</i>

813
01:00:07,317 --> 01:00:10,571
<i>They find his wife and kids</i>
<i>and decide to wait for Soze.</i>

814
01:00:26,795 --> 01:00:27,880
<i>He comes home...</i>

815
01:00:28,172 --> 01:00:31,008
<i>...to find his wife raped</i>
<i>and children screaming.</i>

816
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,803
<i>The Hungarians knew Soze was tough,</i>
<i>not to be trifled with.</i>

817
01:00:35,053 --> 01:00:37,431
So they let him know
they meant business.

818
01:00:41,810 --> 01:00:45,647
<i>They tell him they want his</i>
<i>territory, all his business.</i>

819
01:00:45,898 --> 01:00:49,943
Soze looks over the faces
of his family.

820
01:00:51,195 --> 01:00:54,948
Then he showed these men of will
what will really was.

821
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:17,596
<i>He tells them he would rather</i>
<i>see his family dead...</i>

822
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:20,182
<i>...than live another day after this.</i>

823
01:01:21,308 --> 01:01:23,560
<i>He lets the last Hungarian go.</i>

824
01:01:23,852 --> 01:01:27,731
He waits until his family is
in the ground, then goes after the mob.

825
01:01:28,023 --> 01:01:30,609
He kills their kids.
He kills their wives.

826
01:01:30,859 --> 01:01:33,195
He kills their parents,
their parents' friends.

827
01:01:33,737 --> 01:01:35,989
<i>He burns down the houses</i>
<i>they live in...</i>

828
01:01:36,949 --> 01:01:38,575
<i>...the stores they work in.</i>

829
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,245
<i>He kills people that owe them money.</i>

830
01:01:41,537 --> 01:01:42,704
<i>And like that...</i>

831
01:01:44,081 --> 01:01:44,998
...he's gone.

832
01:01:45,249 --> 01:01:47,251
Underground.
Nobody's ever seen him since.

833
01:01:47,501 --> 01:01:51,672
He becomes a myth. A spook story that
criminals tell their kids at night.

834
01:01:51,922 --> 01:01:55,134
"Rat on your pop,
and Keyser Soze will get you."

835
01:01:55,926 --> 01:01:57,845
And no one ever really believes.

836
01:01:58,137 --> 01:02:00,013
Do you believe in him, Verbal?

837
01:02:02,724 --> 01:02:04,393
Keaton always said:

838
01:02:04,643 --> 01:02:08,147
"I don't believe in God
but I'm afraid of him."

839
01:02:10,065 --> 01:02:12,109
Well, I believe in God.

840
01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:14,528
And the only thing that scares me...

841
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,697
...is Keyser Soze.

842
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:25,289
Do you give any weight to this?

843
01:02:25,581 --> 01:02:29,543
I can introduce you to Dan Metzheiser.
He's got a file on Soze in D.C.

844
01:02:29,835 --> 01:02:31,503
It's a hobby of his.

845
01:02:31,795 --> 01:02:35,466
A lot of guys equate him to that
reporter on <i>The Incredible Hulk</i>.

846
01:02:40,471 --> 01:02:43,182
- You've heard of him?
- Where? On the street?

847
01:02:43,474 --> 01:02:46,143
Yeah, a few times. Outside stuff.

848
01:02:46,435 --> 01:02:49,062
Somebody worked for a guy
who got some money...

849
01:02:49,354 --> 01:02:51,940
...from Keyser Soze.
You know, shit like that.

850
01:02:53,066 --> 01:02:55,194
It could be an old badge.
A hex sign...

851
01:02:55,486 --> 01:02:58,030
...to keep people from fucking with you.

852
01:02:58,322 --> 01:03:00,365
- But you're here.
- Well, shit, yeah.

853
01:03:00,657 --> 01:03:04,870
A guy left a hospital on a fried
drumstick because he's afraid of Soze.

854
01:03:05,204 --> 01:03:07,164
I'll run it up the flagpole.

855
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:12,920
I came clean. So what if I left out
how I got on the boat.

856
01:03:13,212 --> 01:03:17,174
It's so full of holes, the D.A. would've
told me to blow amnesty out my ass.

857
01:03:17,466 --> 01:03:18,467
Big fucking deal.

858
01:03:18,759 --> 01:03:20,135
That's why you never told the D.A.?

859
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:21,637
You tell me, Agent Kujan.

860
01:03:21,887 --> 01:03:24,932
If I said the Loch Ness monster
hired me, what would you say?

861
01:03:25,182 --> 01:03:27,935
Turn state's evidence.
We'll put you on the stand.

862
01:03:28,185 --> 01:03:30,187
I've got immunity.
What can you offer?

863
01:03:30,437 --> 01:03:32,981
If there is a Soze,
he's gonna come for you.

864
01:03:34,316 --> 01:03:35,859
Where's your head?

865
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:39,571
Where do you think
the pressure's coming from?

866
01:03:39,822 --> 01:03:41,365
Soze knows where I am now.

867
01:03:41,657 --> 01:03:45,452
He's got a burner under you to let
me go, so he can scoop me up later.

868
01:03:45,744 --> 01:03:49,373
Immunity was just a deal with you.
I got a new problem when I post bail.

869
01:03:49,623 --> 01:03:51,583
Why play to him?
We can protect you.

870
01:03:52,417 --> 01:03:53,710
Gee, thanks, Dave.

871
01:03:54,002 --> 01:03:56,755
Bang-up job so far.
Extortion. Coercion.

872
01:03:57,005 --> 01:03:58,507
Pardon me, kiss my pucker.

873
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:03,262
The fuckers that rounded us up and sank
us into this mess are bailing me out?

874
01:04:05,889 --> 01:04:08,267
You think you can catch Keyser Soze?

875
01:04:08,517 --> 01:04:12,813
You think he'd come this close to
getting caught and stick his head out?

876
01:04:13,355 --> 01:04:16,108
If he comes up,
it'll be to get rid of me.

877
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,234
After that...

878
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:21,196
...my guess is, you'll never
hear from him again.

879
01:04:43,343 --> 01:04:44,970
What happened next?

880
01:04:45,345 --> 01:04:47,598
The next morning Fenster was gone.

881
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:50,476
He couldn't handle the idea
of slumming for Soze.

882
01:04:50,726 --> 01:04:55,189
He left us a note and took a chunk
of the money we'd scraped together.

883
01:04:55,689 --> 01:04:56,773
Then what?

884
01:04:57,065 --> 01:04:58,233
McManus was furious.

885
01:04:58,525 --> 01:05:02,696
He was talking about tracking him down
and ripping his heart out.

886
01:05:03,572 --> 01:05:05,616
That night we got the call.

887
01:05:06,033 --> 01:05:07,117
What call?

888
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:09,995
Kobayashi told us where
we could find Fenster.

889
01:05:17,836 --> 01:05:20,214
All right.
Let's get the fuck out of here.

890
01:05:21,924 --> 01:05:23,550
We gotta bury him.

891
01:05:23,801 --> 01:05:25,219
With what?

892
01:05:25,469 --> 01:05:27,304
With our hands.

893
01:05:36,772 --> 01:05:38,690
This is nuts.

894
01:05:38,941 --> 01:05:40,067
It's dry fucking sand.

895
01:05:40,359 --> 01:05:44,029
When he rots, the surfers
are gonna smell him a mile away.

896
01:05:44,279 --> 01:05:45,072
Fuck!

897
01:05:45,322 --> 01:05:47,908
What are we gonna do?
This guy's gonna kill us.

898
01:05:48,158 --> 01:05:52,121
I don't know about you, but
I can run. I got no problem with that.

899
01:05:52,955 --> 01:05:56,083
Kobayashi doesn't seem to have
a problem with it either.

900
01:05:57,042 --> 01:05:58,210
If you run...

901
01:05:58,502 --> 01:06:01,088
...we'll be digging
a hole for you. You got that?

902
01:06:01,964 --> 01:06:04,007
This ain't my boy we're burying.

903
01:06:04,341 --> 01:06:05,592
I don't owe anybody!

904
01:06:06,218 --> 01:06:07,469
So fuck you.

905
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:09,888
He was my partner for five years.

906
01:06:10,180 --> 01:06:13,392
We did more jobs and saw more money
than you can count.

907
01:06:13,642 --> 01:06:15,477
So fuck you!

908
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:17,104
Because now it's payback.

909
01:06:17,354 --> 01:06:19,022
It's not payback!

910
01:06:21,984 --> 01:06:23,318
It's precaution.

911
01:06:23,610 --> 01:06:26,113
You want payback? You wanna run?
I don't care.

912
01:06:29,575 --> 01:06:31,743
I'm not doing this for Fenster.

913
01:06:32,494 --> 01:06:34,455
I'm not doing it for you.

914
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:37,791
I'm doing this for me.

915
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:41,753
I'm gonna finish this thing.

916
01:06:42,254 --> 01:06:45,924
This Kobayashi bastard
isn't gonna stand on me.

917
01:07:06,570 --> 01:07:08,530
After they killed Fenster,
nobody ran?

918
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:11,074
I wanted to.
I thought we could make it.

919
01:07:11,366 --> 01:07:12,701
Why didn't you say anything?

920
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:17,122
I tried, but Keaton wouldn't have it.
It was too far-fetched for him.

921
01:07:17,414 --> 01:07:19,833
Keaton was a grounded guy. An ex-cop.

922
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:22,836
To a cop, the explanation
is never that complicated.

923
01:07:23,086 --> 01:07:27,257
There's no mystery to the street.
No archcriminal behind it all.

924
01:07:27,549 --> 01:07:30,886
If you got a body and think
his brother did it, you're right.

925
01:07:31,136 --> 01:07:35,140
Nobody argued with Keaton. They just
set their minds to Kobayashi.

926
01:07:45,692 --> 01:07:46,819
They're coming up.

927
01:07:48,529 --> 01:07:50,781
<i>Did you hear me? He's coming up.</i>

928
01:07:51,031 --> 01:07:52,658
He's on his way down.

929
01:08:49,298 --> 01:08:50,841
Don't move.

930
01:08:51,633 --> 01:08:53,343
Press 20. Do it now.

931
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:14,823
Move!

932
01:09:17,993 --> 01:09:19,411
The answer is no.

933
01:09:19,745 --> 01:09:22,956
- Mr. Soze will be most...
- There is no Keyser Soze.

934
01:09:23,248 --> 01:09:25,042
Mention him again,
I'll kill you.

935
01:09:25,292 --> 01:09:29,671
A strange threat. I can only assume
you've come here to kill me anyway.

936
01:09:35,052 --> 01:09:38,180
Now, we know that you can get to us.

937
01:09:38,430 --> 01:09:40,891
But now you know that
we can get to you.

938
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:44,478
I'm giving you one last chance
to call this off.

939
01:09:44,770 --> 01:09:46,021
Mr. S...

940
01:09:46,313 --> 01:09:49,691
My employer has made up his mind.
He does not change it.

941
01:09:49,983 --> 01:09:50,901
Neither do we.

942
01:09:51,568 --> 01:09:54,571
You got Fenster, but you
won't be able to get all of us.

943
01:09:54,822 --> 01:09:56,365
Not before we get to you.

944
01:09:56,657 --> 01:09:58,408
I believe you, Mr. McManus.

945
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:00,577
I most sincerely do.

946
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:03,497
You wouldn't be chosen
were you not so suitable.

947
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:05,749
But I cannot make this decision.

948
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:10,420
What you threaten me with is ludicrous
compared to what will be done to me...

949
01:10:10,712 --> 01:10:13,632
...if I do not carry out
my orders in full.

950
01:10:20,848 --> 01:10:23,016
I'm the guy that's gonna get you.

951
01:10:25,018 --> 01:10:27,396
I just wanted you to know that.

952
01:10:28,147 --> 01:10:30,357
I'm so sorry, Mr. McManus.

953
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:33,277
I implore you, Mr. Keaton,
believe me...

954
01:10:33,569 --> 01:10:36,822
...Mr. Soze is very real
and very determined.

955
01:10:37,114 --> 01:10:38,449
We'll see.

956
01:10:45,873 --> 01:10:49,209
Before you do me in, Mr. McManus...

957
01:10:49,460 --> 01:10:53,464
...you'll let me finish my business
with Ms. Finneran, won't you?

958
01:10:58,594 --> 01:11:00,137
What did you say?

959
01:11:01,180 --> 01:11:02,681
Edie Finneran.

960
01:11:02,973 --> 01:11:05,392
She's upstairs. In my office.

961
01:11:05,684 --> 01:11:08,479
For an extradition deposition.

962
01:11:08,937 --> 01:11:11,356
I requested she be put
on the case personally.

963
01:11:11,607 --> 01:11:13,484
She flew in yesterday.

964
01:11:15,652 --> 01:11:17,029
No matter.

965
01:11:17,446 --> 01:11:19,740
Kill away, Mr. McManus.

966
01:11:24,119 --> 01:11:25,579
You're lying.

967
01:11:26,121 --> 01:11:27,456
Am I?

968
01:11:44,681 --> 01:11:48,268
Ms. Finneran's escort while
she's here in Los Angeles.

969
01:11:48,519 --> 01:11:50,103
Never leaves her side.

970
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:53,524
I thought you'd be glad to know
she's in good hands.

971
01:11:57,736 --> 01:12:00,572
Get some rest. The boat
will be ready Friday.

972
01:12:00,823 --> 01:12:03,283
If I see you or any of your friends
before then...

973
01:12:03,534 --> 01:12:07,913
...she'll find herself the victim of a
gruesome violation before she dies.

974
01:12:08,163 --> 01:12:10,707
As indeed, will your father,
Mr. Hockney...

975
01:12:11,291 --> 01:12:14,795
...and your Uncle Randall
in Arizona, Mr. Kint.

976
01:12:15,129 --> 01:12:19,383
I might only castrate
Mr. McManus' nephew, David.

977
01:12:21,510 --> 01:12:23,428
Do I make myself clear?

978
01:12:23,929 --> 01:12:26,140
Take care of the bodies downstairs.

979
01:12:26,390 --> 01:12:28,934
We'll add them to the cost
of Mr. Fenster.

980
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:31,061
Excuse me, gentlemen.

981
01:13:09,850 --> 01:13:11,935
It's a logistical nightmare.

982
01:13:12,227 --> 01:13:15,522
Close quarters.
Ten, maybe 20 men.

983
01:13:15,814 --> 01:13:18,192
No telling how many more
will be below deck.

984
01:13:18,525 --> 01:13:20,486
- Can we stealth these guys?
- No.

985
01:13:21,445 --> 01:13:23,822
With all that coke,
they're gonna be ready.

986
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,868
Which brings me
to sunny point number two.

987
01:13:28,327 --> 01:13:31,580
Even if we get through and
jack the boat, we got nothing.

988
01:13:31,872 --> 01:13:33,665
What if we wait for the money?

989
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:36,335
Ten more men at least.

990
01:13:36,752 --> 01:13:39,797
Look, in my opinion, it can't be done.

991
01:13:40,047 --> 01:13:42,007
Whoever goes there
won't come out alive.

992
01:13:42,257 --> 01:13:43,592
I'm gonna wait for the money.

993
01:13:44,259 --> 01:13:47,262
- Me too.
- Did you hear what he just said?

994
01:13:47,513 --> 01:13:49,598
- If I'm going in, I want a cut.
- Me too.

995
01:13:51,558 --> 01:13:53,602
There's nothing that can't be done.

996
01:13:56,647 --> 01:13:59,358
I can't believe we're
walking into certain death.

997
01:14:06,615 --> 01:14:09,076
The news said
it's raining in New York.

998
01:14:30,806 --> 01:14:32,349
What language is that?

999
01:14:32,641 --> 01:14:33,934
I don't know.

1000
01:14:34,226 --> 01:14:36,395
Russian, I think.

1001
01:14:37,688 --> 01:14:39,314
Hungarian.

1002
01:15:43,253 --> 01:15:46,048
The package has arrived, gentlemen.

1003
01:16:05,776 --> 01:16:06,777
You kids ready?

1004
01:16:07,444 --> 01:16:10,280
I would be if I didn't
have to stop and answer you.

1005
01:16:10,572 --> 01:16:14,827
I'm ready. McManus, you better be
set up in 10 seconds.

1006
01:16:17,037 --> 01:16:18,080
I'm ready.

1007
01:16:19,748 --> 01:16:21,333
I want you to stay here.

1008
01:16:22,709 --> 01:16:23,961
I'm supposed to cover...

1009
01:16:24,211 --> 01:16:27,339
If we don't get out of this,
take the money and go.

1010
01:16:27,589 --> 01:16:32,219
Find Edie. Tell her what happened.
She knows people and knows what to do.

1011
01:16:32,594 --> 01:16:36,306
If I don't get Kobayashi my way,
she'll get him her way.

1012
01:16:36,557 --> 01:16:38,183
Just do what I say.

1013
01:16:38,934 --> 01:16:40,269
Please.

1014
01:16:43,313 --> 01:16:44,857
Tell her that...

1015
01:16:48,527 --> 01:16:50,279
Tell her I tried.

1016
01:17:03,292 --> 01:17:04,209
<i>McManus...</i>

1017
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,919
<i>...he's on his way.</i>

1018
01:17:06,253 --> 01:17:07,379
I'm there.

1019
01:17:59,598 --> 01:18:03,477
One, two, three, four...

1020
01:18:03,769 --> 01:18:07,022
...five, six, seven...

1021
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:10,025
Oswald was a fag.

1022
01:18:20,035 --> 01:18:21,411
How you doing?

1023
01:18:24,414 --> 01:18:26,834
Is there...
Is there a problem?

1024
01:18:52,276 --> 01:18:53,277
Now.

1025
01:19:23,265 --> 01:19:26,268
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

1026
01:19:26,810 --> 01:19:29,313
<i>E-I-E-I-O</i>

1027
01:19:29,813 --> 01:19:34,359
<i>And on that farm he shot some guys</i>

1028
01:19:34,735 --> 01:19:37,070
<i>Bada-boom</i>
<i>Bada-bing-bang-boom</i>

1029
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:09,436
Elvis has left the building.

1030
01:22:32,579 --> 01:22:34,039
<i>Why didn't you run?</i>

1031
01:22:34,665 --> 01:22:36,041
I froze up.

1032
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:40,170
I thought about Fenster,
how he looked when we buried him.

1033
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:43,757
I thought about Keaton.
It looked like he might pull it off.

1034
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:55,018
A boy came across a body on the beach
today. Shot twice in the head.

1035
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:57,771
Two guys from the Bureau
just identified him.

1036
01:22:58,021 --> 01:23:01,233
Arturro Marquez.
A petty smuggler from Argentina.

1037
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:04,194
Arrested last year
in New York for trafficking.

1038
01:23:04,445 --> 01:23:07,948
He escapes to California.
They pick him up in Long Beach.

1039
01:23:08,198 --> 01:23:11,326
They're setting up extradition,
he escapes again.

1040
01:23:11,618 --> 01:23:12,953
Now, get this.

1041
01:23:13,203 --> 01:23:16,540
Edie Finneran's brought in
to advise on the proceedings.

1042
01:23:16,832 --> 01:23:17,958
Kobayashi.

1043
01:23:18,250 --> 01:23:21,336
New York faxed me a copy
of his testimony. He was a rat.

1044
01:23:21,628 --> 01:23:22,588
A big rat.

1045
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,591
Arturro was very opposed
to returning to prison.

1046
01:23:25,883 --> 01:23:29,761
So much so that he named
close to 50 people.

1047
01:23:30,053 --> 01:23:32,556
Guess who he named in the finale?

1048
01:23:33,390 --> 01:23:34,850
Keyser Soze.

1049
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:36,685
There's more.

1050
01:23:48,739 --> 01:23:50,324
I'll tell you what I know.

1051
01:23:50,616 --> 01:23:53,202
Stop me when this sounds familiar.

1052
01:23:54,495 --> 01:23:56,955
There was no dope on that boat.

1053
01:24:38,580 --> 01:24:39,957
You, stay quiet.

1054
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:41,583
He is here.

1055
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,127
I know he is here.

1056
01:24:43,752 --> 01:24:45,921
That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

1057
01:24:46,171 --> 01:24:48,048
I know he is here!

1058
01:24:49,216 --> 01:24:51,802
- You can't understand. That's him.
- Shut up!

1059
01:24:52,052 --> 01:24:53,470
That's him! You hear me?

1060
01:24:53,720 --> 01:24:57,224
I'm telling you, it's Keyser Soze!

1061
01:26:55,092 --> 01:26:56,802
- Where's Hockney?
- I don't know.

1062
01:26:57,052 --> 01:26:58,595
There's no coke!

1063
01:26:59,555 --> 01:27:02,182
You heard me, you dumb fuck!
There's no coke!

1064
01:27:02,432 --> 01:27:05,936
I've been up and down this ship!
Every fucking room!

1065
01:27:06,228 --> 01:27:08,105
There is nothing!

1066
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:09,773
Nothing!

1067
01:27:10,065 --> 01:27:11,358
Don't you fuck with me!

1068
01:27:11,650 --> 01:27:15,779
There is no fucking coke!

1069
01:27:26,498 --> 01:27:28,000
I'm out of here.

1070
01:28:08,957 --> 01:28:11,210
I told them nothing.

1071
01:28:12,169 --> 01:28:13,504
I swear.

1072
01:28:14,213 --> 01:28:16,632
I told them nothing. Please.

1073
01:29:02,928 --> 01:29:03,762
McManus.

1074
01:29:04,179 --> 01:29:05,848
What the fuck is going on?

1075
01:29:08,475 --> 01:29:10,435
The strangest thing...

1076
01:30:04,990 --> 01:30:08,035
You say you saw a man in a suit
with a slim build.

1077
01:30:08,327 --> 01:30:09,828
- Wait a minute.
- No.

1078
01:30:10,078 --> 01:30:13,540
You saw Soze? You told the D.A.
you didn't know who it was.

1079
01:30:13,832 --> 01:30:15,542
I know there was dope there.

1080
01:30:15,793 --> 01:30:17,836
You know what I'm getting at!

1081
01:30:18,128 --> 01:30:19,588
Get out of my face.

1082
01:30:19,880 --> 01:30:22,800
I've got immunity.
I don't have to take that shit!

1083
01:30:23,050 --> 01:30:25,093
You know what I'm getting at.

1084
01:30:25,385 --> 01:30:29,264
The truth! Try to tell me
you saw someone kill Keaton.

1085
01:30:29,556 --> 01:30:31,725
- I did.
- You're lying to me!

1086
01:30:31,975 --> 01:30:34,353
You've known this whole fucking time.

1087
01:30:34,603 --> 01:30:37,648
I don't know what you're saying.
I saw Keaton get shot.

1088
01:30:37,898 --> 01:30:40,818
Then why didn't you help him?
You had a gun.

1089
01:30:41,068 --> 01:30:42,611
He was your friend.

1090
01:30:46,698 --> 01:30:48,659
Because I was afraid.

1091
01:30:49,368 --> 01:30:50,452
Okay?

1092
01:30:50,702 --> 01:30:53,038
- Afraid.
- Afraid of what?

1093
01:30:54,623 --> 01:30:56,542
I knew it was Keyser Soze.

1094
01:30:56,792 --> 01:31:00,963
It was Keyser Soze, Agent Kujan.
I mean, the devil himself.

1095
01:31:02,047 --> 01:31:04,508
How do you shoot the devil
in the back?

1096
01:31:09,221 --> 01:31:10,764
What if you miss?

1097
01:31:15,602 --> 01:31:18,063
All right.
Let's get back to the pier.

1098
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:42,981
Ever hear of Arturro Marquez?

1099
01:32:43,273 --> 01:32:44,691
What? No.

1100
01:32:44,942 --> 01:32:47,444
<i>He was a stool pigeon</i>
<i>for the Justice Department.</i>

1101
01:32:47,736 --> 01:32:50,989
He swore out a statement
saying that he had seen...

1102
01:32:51,281 --> 01:32:55,202
...and could positively identify
one Keyser Soze.

1103
01:32:55,452 --> 01:32:56,745
It says right here:

1104
01:32:57,037 --> 01:33:01,208
"He had knowledge of his businesses,
including but not exclusive...

1105
01:33:01,458 --> 01:33:04,670
...to trafficking and murder."
- I never heard of him.

1106
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,422
His own people were selling him
to Hungarians.

1107
01:33:07,673 --> 01:33:11,385
<i>Most likely the Hungarians that</i>
<i>Soze all but wiped out in Turkey.</i>

1108
01:33:11,635 --> 01:33:12,928
The money wasn't for dope.

1109
01:33:13,428 --> 01:33:17,933
The Hungarians were buying the one guy
that could incriminate Keyser Soze.

1110
01:33:18,183 --> 01:33:19,393
I never heard of him.

1111
01:33:19,685 --> 01:33:23,564
Keaton did. Edie Finneran
was Marquez's extradition adviser.

1112
01:33:23,814 --> 01:33:25,524
She knew what he knew.

1113
01:33:25,774 --> 01:33:28,527
- I don't...
- There were no drugs on that boat.

1114
01:33:28,777 --> 01:33:32,406
It was a hit. A suicide mission
to whack out the one guy...

1115
01:33:32,656 --> 01:33:34,700
<i>...that could finger Keyser Soze.</i>

1116
01:33:34,950 --> 01:33:36,869
<i>Soze put some thieves to it.</i>

1117
01:33:37,244 --> 01:33:39,621
<i>Men he knew he could march</i>
<i>into certain death.</i>

1118
01:33:39,872 --> 01:33:42,499
You're saying Soze
sent us to kill someone?

1119
01:33:43,667 --> 01:33:46,336
<i>Keaton did.</i>
<i>He left you behind for a reason.</i>

1120
01:33:46,628 --> 01:33:48,422
Just do what I tell you.

1121
01:33:48,714 --> 01:33:51,508
If you all knew that Soze
could find you anywhere...

1122
01:33:51,758 --> 01:33:55,679
...why did he give you the money
to run? He could use you on the boat.

1123
01:33:55,929 --> 01:33:57,473
He wanted me to live.

1124
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:03,145
<i>A one-time dirty cop without a</i>
<i>loyalty in the world wants to save...</i>

1125
01:34:03,395 --> 01:34:04,688
<i>...a worthless cripple?</i>

1126
01:34:04,980 --> 01:34:06,565
No, sir. Why?

1127
01:34:07,316 --> 01:34:10,736
- Edie.
- I don't buy that reform story.

1128
01:34:11,028 --> 01:34:15,783
Even if I did, I don't believe
he would send you to protect her.

1129
01:34:16,074 --> 01:34:17,618
So why?

1130
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:21,413
Because he was my friend.

1131
01:34:21,705 --> 01:34:25,959
No, Verbal. He wasn't your friend.
Keaton didn't have friends.

1132
01:34:26,251 --> 01:34:27,044
Why are you here?

1133
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:31,173
He saved you because he wanted it
that way. It was his will.

1134
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,759
Keaton was Keyser Soze!

1135
01:34:34,635 --> 01:34:37,971
He could wrangle the wills
of men like Hockney and McManus.

1136
01:34:38,222 --> 01:34:43,227
He could engineer a police
lineup through his contacts in NYPD.

1137
01:34:43,477 --> 01:34:46,063
He's a man who could've killed
Edie Finneran!

1138
01:34:50,901 --> 01:34:55,989
She was found yesterday in a hotel in
Pennsylvania, shot twice in the head.

1139
01:35:00,702 --> 01:35:03,080
What do you think about Keaton now?

1140
01:35:04,623 --> 01:35:06,208
Edie?

1141
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,711
He used you to get on the boat.
He couldn't get on alone.

1142
01:35:09,962 --> 01:35:13,507
He had to pull the trigger himself
to make sure he got his man.

1143
01:35:13,757 --> 01:35:15,759
The one man that could identify him.

1144
01:35:16,718 --> 01:35:18,554
This is all bullshit.

1145
01:35:18,804 --> 01:35:20,806
You said you saw him die.

1146
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,226
Or did you?

1147
01:35:24,476 --> 01:35:26,603
You hid when you heard the police.

1148
01:35:26,854 --> 01:35:29,481
You said you heard the shot
before the fire.

1149
01:35:29,731 --> 01:35:31,650
But you didn't see him die.

1150
01:35:31,942 --> 01:35:33,277
I knew him. He'd never...

1151
01:35:33,527 --> 01:35:34,945
He programmed you.

1152
01:35:35,195 --> 01:35:39,575
He programmed you to tell us what he
wanted you to. He knew we were close.

1153
01:35:39,825 --> 01:35:42,911
Where was the pressure coming from?
Why were you protected?

1154
01:35:43,162 --> 01:35:45,998
It was Keaton.
Immunity was your reward.

1155
01:35:46,248 --> 01:35:47,916
But why me?

1156
01:35:48,208 --> 01:35:50,627
Why not Fenster, McManus or Hockney?
Why me?

1157
01:35:50,878 --> 01:35:52,754
I'm stupid. I'm a cripple.

1158
01:35:53,046 --> 01:35:54,631
Because you're a cripple.

1159
01:35:55,048 --> 01:35:56,717
Because you're stupid.

1160
01:35:57,009 --> 01:35:59,052
Because you're weaker than them.

1161
01:36:03,223 --> 01:36:04,558
If he's dead...

1162
01:36:04,933 --> 01:36:08,979
...if what you say is true,
then it won't matter.

1163
01:36:10,355 --> 01:36:13,275
It was his idea to hit
the Taxi Service, wasn't it?

1164
01:36:13,525 --> 01:36:16,612
- Come on, tell me the truth.
- It was all Keaton.

1165
01:36:17,821 --> 01:36:21,074
We followed him from the beginning.

1166
01:36:22,201 --> 01:36:23,368
I didn't know.

1167
01:36:23,827 --> 01:36:26,079
I saw him die.

1168
01:36:26,371 --> 01:36:30,125
I believe he's dead. Oh, Christ!

1169
01:36:30,793 --> 01:36:32,503
You're not safe on your own.

1170
01:36:36,632 --> 01:36:37,841
You think he's...

1171
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:39,843
Keyser Soze?

1172
01:36:40,385 --> 01:36:41,929
I don't know, Verbal.

1173
01:36:43,597 --> 01:36:47,559
Keyser Soze's a shield.
Or like you said, "a spook story."

1174
01:36:48,644 --> 01:36:52,397
But I know Keaton. And someone is
out there pulling strings for you.

1175
01:36:53,023 --> 01:36:56,610
- Stay here and let us protect you.
- I'm not bait. I post today.

1176
01:36:56,860 --> 01:36:58,153
You posted 20 minutes ago.

1177
01:36:58,737 --> 01:37:00,864
Capt. Leo wants you
out of here ASAP.

1178
01:37:01,115 --> 01:37:04,076
- Unless you turn state's.
- I'll take my chances.

1179
01:37:04,326 --> 01:37:07,830
If someone wants to get you,
they're gonna get you out there.

1180
01:37:08,080 --> 01:37:11,375
Turn state's evidence.
You might never see trial.

1181
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,210
Maybe so.

1182
01:37:14,545 --> 01:37:16,880
But I'm not a rat, Agent Kujan.

1183
01:37:32,855 --> 01:37:35,107
Fucking cops!

1184
01:37:59,089 --> 01:38:01,717
Excuse me.
Can I use your fax machine?

1185
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:08,891
You'll have to sign for these,
Mr. Kint.

1186
01:38:10,476 --> 01:38:12,269
One watch, gold.

1187
01:38:12,561 --> 01:38:14,730
One cigarette lighter, gold.

1188
01:38:15,647 --> 01:38:17,649
One pack of cigarettes. Thank you.

1189
01:38:18,192 --> 01:38:20,360
We still got nothing, Dave.

1190
01:38:20,736 --> 01:38:22,738
I know what I wanted
to know about Keaton.

1191
01:38:22,988 --> 01:38:24,531
Which is nothing.

1192
01:38:25,073 --> 01:38:26,200
No matter.

1193
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:28,577
He'll have to know how close we came.

1194
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:31,789
<i>Keyser Soze or no Keyser Soze...</i>

1195
01:38:32,039 --> 01:38:35,167
<i>...if Keaton is alive,</i>
<i>he's not coming up again.</i>

1196
01:38:35,459 --> 01:38:36,835
<i>I'll find him.</i>

1197
01:38:37,795 --> 01:38:39,338
<i>Waste of time.</i>

1198
01:38:41,882 --> 01:38:44,551
<i>A rumor's not a rumor</i>
<i>that doesn't die.</i>

1199
01:38:44,968 --> 01:38:46,178
<i>What?</i>

1200
01:38:47,095 --> 01:38:48,013
<i>Nothing.</i>

1201
01:38:50,057 --> 01:38:51,517
Man, you're a slob.

1202
01:38:51,767 --> 01:38:54,895
Yeah, but it all has a system, Dave.

1203
01:38:55,187 --> 01:38:59,358
It don't make sense when you look right
at it. You gotta stand back from it.

1204
01:39:00,692 --> 01:39:04,154
Wanna see a real horror show?
You should see my garage.

1205
01:39:41,358 --> 01:39:42,609
<i>Convince me.</i>

1206
01:39:42,860 --> 01:39:45,821
<i>When I was in that quartet</i>
<i>in Skokie...</i>

1207
01:39:46,071 --> 01:39:47,614
<i>Where's your head?</i>

1208
01:39:47,865 --> 01:39:50,075
<i>What we need to do is think.</i>
<i>Think back.</i>

1209
01:39:50,325 --> 01:39:52,286
<i>I'm sure you've heard tall tales.</i>

1210
01:39:52,536 --> 01:39:54,663
- <i>This isn't right.</i>
- <i>I just want your story.</i>

1211
01:39:54,913 --> 01:39:57,541
<i>It's all there.</i>
<i>I'm telling it straight, I swear.</i>

1212
01:39:57,833 --> 01:39:59,668
- <i>guy in California</i>
<i>named Redfoot.</i>

1213
01:39:59,918 --> 01:40:01,670
<i>A gift from Mr. Soze.</i>

1214
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,507
- <i>What about Redfoot?</i>
- <i>Mr. Redfoot knew nothing.</i>

1215
01:40:05,757 --> 01:40:08,385
<i>Big, fat guy.</i>
<i>I mean, orca fat.</i>

1216
01:40:08,677 --> 01:40:10,762
- <i>There was a lawyer.</i>
- <i>Kobayashi.</i>

1217
01:40:11,013 --> 01:40:12,139
- <i>never see him again.</i>

1218
01:40:12,431 --> 01:40:15,350
- <i>in Guatemala, we made</i>
<i>fresh coffee.</i>

1219
01:40:15,601 --> 01:40:18,479
<i>...- thought he was a good man.</i>
- <i>I know he was good.</i>

1220
01:40:20,898 --> 01:40:22,775
<i>And tell me every last detail.</i>

1221
01:40:23,066 --> 01:40:25,319
<i>How do you shoot the devil</i>
<i>in the back?</i>

1222
01:40:25,569 --> 01:40:29,072
<i>He's protected from up on high</i>
<i>by the Prince...</i>

1223
01:40:29,364 --> 01:40:30,991
<i>What about it, pretzel man?</i>

1224
01:40:31,241 --> 01:40:33,118
- <i>There was a lawyer.</i>
- <i>What lawyer?</i>

1225
01:40:33,368 --> 01:40:36,205
- <i>I am Mr. Kobayashi.</i>
- <i>Kobayashi. Kobayashi.</i>

1226
01:40:36,455 --> 01:40:37,831
<i>Tell me every last detail.</i>

1227
01:40:38,081 --> 01:40:40,918
<i>I work for Keyser Soze.</i>

1228
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:42,377
<i>Convince me.</i>

1229
01:40:56,767 --> 01:41:01,480
<i>Every creep that walks the street</i>
<i>will know the name of Verbal Kint.</i>

1230
01:41:02,106 --> 01:41:05,442
The cripple, did you see him?
Which way did he go?

1231
01:41:05,692 --> 01:41:06,819
He went out that way.

1232
01:41:07,069 --> 01:41:09,279
<i>I know you know something.</i>

1233
01:41:09,571 --> 01:41:12,950
<i>I'm smarter than you.</i>
<i>And I'll find out what I wanna know.</i>

1234
01:41:13,242 --> 01:41:16,620
<i>To a cop, the explanation</i>
<i>is never that complicated.</i>

1235
01:41:16,912 --> 01:41:19,790
<i>There's no mystery to the street.</i>
<i>No archcriminal...</i>

1236
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:24,545
<i>Somebody with power, who was capable</i>
<i>of tracking us from New York to L.A.</i>

1237
01:41:24,795 --> 01:41:28,549
<i>You think he'd come</i>
<i>this close to getting caught...</i>

1238
01:41:28,841 --> 01:41:30,175
<i>...and stick his head out?</i>

1239
01:41:31,927 --> 01:41:34,513
<i>Because you're stupid.</i>
<i>Because you're a cripple.</i>

1240
01:41:36,807 --> 01:41:39,268
<i>You've known the whole fucking time!</i>

1241
01:41:41,728 --> 01:41:42,688
<i>Keaton's dead.</i>

1242
01:41:42,980 --> 01:41:46,066
<i>I can't feel my legs, Keyser.</i>

1243
01:41:46,316 --> 01:41:49,862
<i>First thing I learned on the job</i>
<i>was how to spot a murderer.</i>

1244
01:41:50,154 --> 01:41:53,323
- <i>the cripple from New York,</i>
<i>he mention Keyser Soze?</i>

1245
01:41:54,116 --> 01:41:55,159
<i>Who?</i>

1246
01:41:55,409 --> 01:41:56,827
<i>And after that...</i>

1247
01:41:57,369 --> 01:42:00,164
<i>...my guess is, you'll</i>
<i>never hear from him again.</i>

1248
01:42:20,809 --> 01:42:23,103
<i>The greatest trick</i>
<i>the devil ever pulled...</i>

1249
01:42:23,353 --> 01:42:26,231
<i>...was convincing the world</i>
<i>he didn't exist.</i>

1250
01:42:28,150 --> 01:42:29,193
<i>And like that...</i>

1251
01:42:30,861 --> 01:42:32,279
<i>...he's gone.</i>

1252
01:45:53,897 --> 01:45:54,898
