1
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:20,560
Even if you accept the belief that the
high Trendex means a rising sales curve-

2
00:02:20,725 --> 00:02:22,015
-Mr. Thornhill.
-Good night.

3
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:24,645
-Say hello to the missus.
-We're not talking.

4
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,520
My recommendation is still the same.

5
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,733
Spread the good word
in as many small-time segments as we can.

6
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,860
Let the opposition have their high ratings
while we cry all the way to the bank.

7
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,200
Why don't we colonize
at the Colony next week?

8
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:38,990
Let me hear from you, Sam.
Uh, happy thoughts, et cetera.

9
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,620
You better walk me to the Plaza.

10
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:43,705
MAGGIE: I didn't put a coat on.
-Use your blood sugar, child. Come on.

11
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:45,625
-Next?
-Gretchen Sabinson.

12
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,125
Oh, yes. Send her a box of candy
from Blum's, $10. You know the kind.

13
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,630
Each piece wrapped in gold paper.
She'll like that.

14
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:53,255
She'll think she's eating money.

15
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:56,095
Just say to her:
"Darling, I count the days, the hours-"

16
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:58,136
-You sent that one last time.
-I did?

17
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:02,349
Well, put: "Something for your sweet tooth,
baby, and all your other sweet parts. "

18
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:04,601
-I know.
-Could we take a cab, Mr. Thornhill?

19
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,812
-For two blocks?
-You're late and I'm tired.

20
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,523
That's your trouble, Maggie,
you don't eat properly.

21
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,149
Here. Taxi.

22
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:14,277
I have a very sick woman here.
You don't mind, do you?

23
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,904
-Well, no.
ROGER: Thank you very much.

24
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,114
Perfectly all right.

25
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:21,159
-First stop, the Plaza. Don't throw the flag.
-Poor man.

26
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,412
Oh, come, come, come.
I made him a happy man.

27
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:27,791
-I made him feel like a good Samaritan.
-He knew you were lying.

28
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:31,128
Ah, in the world of advertising,
there's no such thing as a lie.

29
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:35,257
There's only the expedient exaggeration.
You ought to know that.

30
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:38,260
-Say, do I look heavyish to you?
-What?

31
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,845
I feel heavyish.

32
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,514
Put a note on my desk in the morning:
"Think thin. "

33
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,474
"Think thin. "

34
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,561
-Better make it the 59th Street entrance.
-Okay.

35
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,439
Oh. Soon as you get back,
call my mother.

36
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,150
Remind her we've got those theater tickets
for tonight.

37
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,068
Dinner at 21, 7: 00.

38
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,156
I'll have had two martinis at the Oak Bar,
so she needn't bother to sniff my breath.

39
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:02,159
-She doesn't do that.
-Sure she does. Like a bloodhound.

40
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,829
Bigelow at 10: 30 is your first tomorrow,
the Skin Glow rehearsal at noon...

41
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,998
... then lunch with Falcon and his wife.

42
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:10,459
-Oh, yeah. Where was that?
-Larry and Arnold's, 1: 00.

43
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,586
-Oh.
-Will you check in later?

44
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,795
Absolutely not.

45
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,716
Here, driver, take this lady
back where she belongs.

46
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:19,885
-Right.
-That ought to cover it.

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,138
-Don't forget, call my mother right away.
-I won't.

48
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,183
-Good night, Mr. Thornhill.
-Good night, sweetie.

49
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,022
Oh, wait, Maggie. You can't call her.
She's at Mrs. --

50
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,378
-Good evening.
ROGER: Good evening.

51
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,964
I'm looking for Mr. Weltner
and two other gentlemen.

52
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,883
Yes, sir. Right this way.

53
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,177
ROGER: Herman.
-Roger.

54
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,012
-I'm a little late.
-Roger Thornhill.

55
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:05,639
-Fanning Nelson.
-How do you do?

56
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,349
-How do you do?
-Larry Wade.

57
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,560
-We got a little head start here.
-Oh, that won't last long.

58
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:15,232
I was telling Larry and Fanning you may be
slow on starting but there's nobody faster.

59
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,818
-What's the matter? You've got the fidgets.
-I just did something stupid.

60
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:22,572
I told my secretary to call Mother.
I realized she won't be able to reach her.

61
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,700
HERMAN: Why not?
-She's playing bridge at one of her cronies'.

62
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,286
-Your secretary?
-No. My mother.

63
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,498
One of those new apartments.
Wet paint and no telephone yet.

64
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:33,917
MAN: George Kaplan.
-Perhaps if I send her a telegram.

65
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,710
-Mr. George Kaplan?
ROGER: Boy.

66
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,302
-Kaplan.
-I've got to get off a wire immediately.

67
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,763
Could you send it for me
if I write it out for you?

68
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,432
Oh, I'm not permitted to do that, sir,
but if you'll follow me.

69
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,435
-Oh. Will you excuse me, gentlemen?
-Go right ahead.

70
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:57,816
-Right through there, sir.
-Yeah, thanks.

71
00:05:57,983 --> 00:05:59,651
Thank you, sir.

72
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,113
Wait, what's that supposed to be?

73
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,741
The car's waiting outside.
You will walk between us saying nothing.

74
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,077
-What are you talking about?
-Let's go.

75
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,289
Let's go where? Who-? Who are you?

76
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,541
Mere errand boys
carrying concealed weapons.

77
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:18,670
His is pointed at your heart. So, please,
no errors of judgment, I beg of you.

78
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,630
What is this, a joke or something?

79
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:24,134
-Yes, a joke. We will laugh in the car.
-Come.

80
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,802
ROGER:
But this is ridiculous.

81
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,951
Don't tell me where we're going,
surprise me.

82
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,497
You know, I left some friends back there
in the Oak Bar.

83
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,541
They're going to think I'm awfully rude.

84
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:59,502
I mean, uh, couldn't we stop off
at a drugstore for a moment...

85
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,924
... so that I could explain
I'm being, uh, kidnapped?

86
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,676
Well, that is what's happening, isn't it?

Who's Townsend?

90
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,330
Really?

91
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,207
Interesting.

92
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,169
-Where is he?
-Upstairs, dressing.

93
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,755
-Tell him I'm here.
-The dinner guests are expected.

94
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,966
Never mind that. Say to him: "Kaplan. "

95
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,385
By the way,
what are we having for dessert?

96
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:32,137
-Is anyone in the library?
-No.

97
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,763
This way.

98
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,109
You will wait here.

99
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:49,195
Well, don't hurry.
I'll catch up on my reading.

[DOOR UNLOCKING]

101
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:32,947
Good evening.

102
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:59,557
Not what I expected. A little taller.

103
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,352
A little more polished than the others.

104
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,189
Oh, I'm so glad you're pleased,
Mr. Townsend.

105
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,692
But I'm afraid just as obvious.

106
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:13,154
What the devil is all this about?
Why was I brought here?

107
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,867
Games? Must we?

108
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,870
Not that I mind a case of abduction...

109
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,665
... but I have tickets
for the theater this evening.

110
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:28,378
To a show I was looking forward to. And I
get unreasonable about things like that.

111
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:32,507
With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.

112
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,137
Oh, Leonard,
have you met our distinguished guest?

113
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,515
He's a well-tailored one, isn't he?

114
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,561
My secretary is a great admirer
of your methods, Mr. Kaplan.

115
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:48,815
-Elusiveness, however misguided-
-Wait a minute. Wait, wait.

116
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,943
-Did you call me "Kaplan"?
-I know you're a man of many names...

117
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,821
... but I'm perfectly willing to accept
your current choice.

118
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:56,155
Current choice?

119
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:59,617
My name is Thornhill. Roger Thornhill.
It's never been anything else.

120
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,327
Of course.

121
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,707
Your friends picked up the wrong package
when they bundled me out here in the car.

122
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,750
Do sit down, Mr. Kaplan.

123
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:11,337
I told you, I'm not Kaplan,
whoever he is. I'm-

-Excuse me.

The guests are here, dear.

00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,760
LESTER: Look after them.
I'll be with you in a few minutes.

127
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,598
Now, shall we get down to business?

128
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,932
I'm all for that.

129
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:26,436
Simply, I'd like you to tell me
how much you know of our arrangements...

130
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,730
... and how you've come by
this information.

131
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,441
-I don't expect to get this for nothing.
-Of course not.

132
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:35,069
Don't misunderstand, I don't expect you
to fall in with this suggestion...

133
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:39,741
... but the least I can do is afford you
the opportunity of surviving the evening.

134
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:44,913
What the devil is that supposed to mean?

135
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,707
Why don't you surprise me,
Mr. Kaplan, and say yes?

136
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,710
ROGER: I've already told you-
-We know where you're headed for.

137
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:51,961
I know where I'm headed.

138
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:56,466
I'm headed for the Winter Garden Theater in
New York, and I think I'd better get going.

139
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,101
Townsend,
you're making a serious mistake.

140
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,314
This is not going to lead
to a very happy conclusion, Mr. Kaplan.

141
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:14,484
ROGER: I'm not Kaplan.
-I do wish you'd reconsider.

142
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:19,238
We also know your contact in Pittsburgh
since Jason committed suicide.

143
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:22,659
What contact?
I've never even been in Pittsburgh.

144
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:26,663
On June the 16th, you checked
into the Sherwyn Hotel in Pittsburgh...

145
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,791
... as Mr. George Kaplan
of Berkeley, California.

146
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,835
A week later, you registered
at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel...

147
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,754
... as Mr. George Kaplan of Pittsburgh.

148
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,340
On August 11th,
you stayed at the Statler in Boston.

149
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:41,177
August the 29th, George Kaplan of Boston
registered at the Whittier in Detroit.

150
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,513
At present, you are registered
in room 796...

151
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,766
... at the Plaza Hotel in New York
as Mr. George Kaplan of Detroit.

152
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,017
-Really?
-In two days...

153
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,437
... you are due at the Ambassador East
in Chicago.

154
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,274
And then at the Sheraton-Johnson Hotel
in Rapid City, South Dakota.

155
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,360
-Not me.
-There's very little sense...

156
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:01,364
... in maintaining that you're deceiving us
any more than we're deceiving you.

157
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,534
I don't suppose it would do any good
to show you ID cards...

158
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,788
-... a driver's license, things like that?
-They provide you with such good ones.

It's getting late. I have guests.

160
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,920
Do you intend to cooperate with us?
I'd like a simple yes or no.

161
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,296

1157
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:17,378
Come again?

1158
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:21,591
Are you sure?

1159
01:35:22,634 --> 01:35:24,344
Okay. Right.

1160
01:35:24,510 --> 01:35:26,012
Yeah, I got it.

1161
01:35:26,179 --> 01:35:28,556
One-oh-five-five, off and clear.

1162
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:32,644
-Where are we going?
-Airport.

1163
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,605
-For what?
-Orders.

1164
01:35:35,772 --> 01:35:37,982
Airport? I don't wanna be taken
to an airport.

1165
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,986
-I want to be taken to police headquarters.
-You do, huh?

1166
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,821
Why do you think I sent for you?

1167
01:35:43,988 --> 01:35:46,908
How about this guy, Charlie?
He sent for us.

1168
01:35:47,075 --> 01:35:48,910
-Sit back.
-Didn't you hear what I said?

1169
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:52,205
I want to be taken to police headquarters.
I'm a dangerous assassin.

1170
01:35:52,372 --> 01:35:56,501
-I'm a mad killer on the loose.
-You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

1171
01:36:22,735 --> 01:36:23,861
They said right here.

1172
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:27,365
Does anyone mind if I sit down?
I've been running all day.

1173
01:36:38,543 --> 01:36:41,671
Thought I'd never make it.
Getting too old for this kind of work.

1174
01:36:42,255 --> 01:36:43,631
All right, men. Thank you.

1175
01:36:44,215 --> 01:36:46,050
-This way, Mr. Thornhill.
-Wait a minute.

1176
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:49,679
We haven't much time.
Yeah, this way is more private.

1177
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:57,353
-I don't think I caught your name.
-I don't think I pitched it.

1178
01:36:57,895 --> 01:37:00,398
You're police, aren't you? Or is it FBI?

1179
01:37:00,565 --> 01:37:02,358
FBI, CIA, ONI.

01:37:02,525 --> 01:37:04,861

-Really?

1181
01:37:05,028 --> 01:37:08,990
You can stick this in your alphabet soup.
I had nothing to do with that killing.

1182
01:37:09,157 --> 01:37:11,284
-We know that.
-You know it?

1183
01:37:11,451 --> 01:37:14,120
Then why did you let the police
chase me all over the map?

1184
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:18,374
We never interfere with the police,
unless absolutely necessary.

1185
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,918
-It's become necessary.
-Oh, I see.

1186
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:23,212
Well, then, I take it
I'm going to be cleared.

1187
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:26,382
I do wish you'd walk faster, Mr. Thornhill.
We'll miss the plane.

1188
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:28,634
Where are we going?
New York or Washington?

1189
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:31,054
Rapid City, South Dakota.

1190
01:37:31,220 --> 01:37:34,724
-Rapid City? What for?
-It's near Mount Rushmore.

1191
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:36,768
No, thank you.
I've seen Mount Rushmore.

1192
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,562
So has your friend Mr. Vandamm.

1193
01:37:39,937 --> 01:37:41,689
Vandamm?

1194
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:44,609
A rather formidable
kind of gentleman, eh?

1195
01:37:44,776 --> 01:37:47,070
What about that treacherous little tramp
with him?

1196
01:37:47,236 --> 01:37:48,488
-Miss Kendall?
-Yeah.

1197
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:50,990
His mistress. We know all about her.

1198
01:37:52,492 --> 01:37:54,452
Tell me, what's Vandamm up to?

1199
01:37:54,619 --> 01:37:57,497
Oh, you could say he's a sort
of importer-exporter.

1200
01:37:57,663 --> 01:37:58,998
Of what?

1201
01:37:59,165 --> 01:38:01,959
Oh. Government secrets, perhaps.

1202
01:38:02,543 --> 01:38:04,295
Well, then why don't you grab him?

1203
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:07,298
There's still too much we don't know
about his organization.

1204
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:08,800
Oh, I see.

1205
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:11,219
What's all this got to do
with Mount Rushmore?

1206
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:13,721
Well, Vandamm has a place near there.

1207
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:17,225
We think it's his jumping-off point
to leave the country tomorrow night.

1208
01:38:17,392 --> 01:38:19,811
-Are you gonna stop him?
-No.

1209
01:38:19,977 --> 01:38:21,813
Well, then what are we going there for?

1210
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:23,981
To set his mind at ease
about George Kaplan.

1211
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:28,486
Oh, you, huh?
You're George Kaplan, aren't you?

1212
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,823
Oh, no, Mr. Thornhill.
There is no such person as George Kaplan.

1213
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,866
What do you mean? I've been in his room.

1214
01:38:34,033 --> 01:38:36,953
I've tried on his clothes.
He's got short sleeves and dandruff.

1215
01:38:37,120 --> 01:38:39,831
Believe me, Mr. Thornhill,
he doesn't exist.

1216
01:38:39,997 --> 01:38:45,920
Which is why I'm gonna have to ask you
to go on being him for the next 24 hours.

1217
01:38:46,087 --> 01:38:48,506
Come on. We'll discuss it on the plane.

without me, you finish it without me.

We might have
if you hadn't stumbled into it.

1221
01:39:16,534 --> 01:39:20,204
You ought to give me a medal
instead of asking me to be a target...

1222
01:39:20,371 --> 01:39:23,374
...just so your special agent or whatever
doesn't get shot at.

1223

Not shot at, Mr. Thornhill. Found out.
Once found out, they're as good as dead.

-You listen to me.

1227
01:39:37,054 --> 01:39:41,642
I'm an advertising man, not a red herring.
I've got a job, a secretary, a mother...

1228
01:39:41,809 --> 01:39:44,562
...two ex-wives and several bartenders
dependent upon me...

1229
01:39:44,729 --> 01:39:48,024
...and I don't intend to disappoint them all
by getting myself killed.

1230
01:39:48,191 --> 01:39:50,443
The answer is no.

01:39:50,610 --> 01:39:52,904
-Is that final?
-Yes.

1232
01:39:53,070 --> 01:39:55,156
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

1233
01:39:55,323 --> 01:39:58,826
If there was a chance of changing
your mind I'd talk about Miss Kendall.

Of whom you so obviously disapprove.

Yes, for using sex
like some people use a fly swatter.

...that she was probably forced to do
whatever she did to protect herself.

1238
01:40:12,256 --> 01:40:14,467
To protect herself from what?

1239
01:40:14,634 --> 01:40:17,512
Exposure and assassination.

1240
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,765
You see, Mr. Thornhill, she....

01:40:21,432 --> 01:40:23,309
She's one of our agents.

-Oh, no.
-I know you didn't mean it...

one last word of caution, Mr. Kaplan.

with this harebrained scheme.

you're the cause of our present trouble.

-...that she fell for you-
-And vice versa.

1254
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:24,328
-our friend Vandamm wouldn't
be losing faith in her loyalty now.

1255
01:41:24,870 --> 01:41:28,666
It was quite obvious to him last night
that she had become emotionally involved.

1256
01:41:28,833 --> 01:41:33,087
Worst of all, with a man he thinks
is a government agent.

1257
01:41:33,546 --> 01:41:35,756
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm irresistible?

I'm trying to remind you it is your
responsibility to help us restore her...

he leaves the country tonight.

-Good afternoon, Mr. Kaplan.
-Not her.

Did I misunderstand you
about bringing her here?

We'll get to that later.

1268

I suppose you were surprised
to get my call.

01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:24,573
Not at all. I knew the police
would release you, Mr. Kaplan.

are we here for today?

of your rendezvous...

...and your ultimate destination.

You wouldn't care to carry my bags for me,
would you?

Perhaps you'd be interested in the price,
just the same.

01:43:58,232 --> 01:44:01,819
-The price?
-For doing nothing to stop you.

How much did you have in mind?

1283
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:07,742
I want the girl.

1284
01:44:10,035 --> 01:44:12,913
I want the girl to get
what's coming to her.

1285

Turn her over to me, I'll see there's
enough pinned on her to keep her...

my feelings for Miss Kendall...

I would trade her in for peace of mind?

I mean, apologize.

1318
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:14,345
No need.

1319
01:47:15,512 --> 01:47:17,264
I understand.

1320
01:47:19,266 --> 01:47:21,352
All in the line of duty.

1321
01:47:22,519 --> 01:47:24,813
I did treat you miserably.

1322
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:26,690
I, uh....

1323
01:47:26,857 --> 01:47:28,942
I hated you for it.

1324
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,445
I didn't want you to go on
thinking that I....

1325
01:47:32,947 --> 01:47:36,700
And I- I used some pretty harsh words.
I'm sorry.

1326
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,702
They hurt deeply.

1327
01:47:38,869 --> 01:47:42,081
-Well, naturally, if I'd known-
-I couldn't tell you.

1328
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:43,999
-Of course not.
-Could I?

1329
01:47:45,918 --> 01:47:47,294
No, I guess not.

1330
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:52,508
EVE: You didn't get hurt. I'm so relieved.
-Of course I was hurt.

1331
01:47:52,675 --> 01:47:55,386
-How would you have felt?
-In the cafeteria, when you fell.

1332
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:59,056
-When I shot you with the blanks.
-Oh, that. No.

1333
01:47:59,723 --> 01:48:04,061
EVE: You did it rather well, I thought.
-Yes, I thought I was quite graceful.

1334
01:48:04,603 --> 01:48:07,731
Considering
it's not really your kind of work.

1335
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:12,820
Well, I got into it by accident.
What's your excuse?

1336
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:18,617
I met Phillip Vandamm at a party one night
and saw only his charm.

1337
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:20,244
Oh.

1338
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,248
I guess I had nothing to do
that weekend, so I....

1339
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:26,750
I decided to fall in love.

1340
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:29,545
Well, that's nice.

1341
01:48:30,462 --> 01:48:35,259
Eventually, the professor and his
Washington colleagues approached me...

1342
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:40,431
...with a few sordid details about Phillip
and he told me that...

1343
01:48:40,597 --> 01:48:44,560
...my relationship with him
made me uniquely valuable to them.

1344
01:48:44,893 --> 01:48:46,145
Mm-hm.

1345
01:48:46,353 --> 01:48:49,231
So you became a Girl Scout, huh?

1346
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:52,860
Maybe it was the first time anyone
ever asked me to do anything worthwhile.

1347
01:48:55,279 --> 01:48:56,697
Has life been like that?

1348
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:01,452
How come?

1349
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:05,456
Men like you.

1350
01:49:06,457 --> 01:49:08,792
What's wrong with men like me?

1351
01:49:09,084 --> 01:49:11,211
They don't believe in marriage.

1352
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:13,130
I've been married twice.

1353
01:49:13,297 --> 01:49:14,423
See what I mean?

1354
01:49:16,675 --> 01:49:19,636
I may go back to hating you.
It was more fun.

1355
01:49:26,393 --> 01:49:27,895
Goodbye, darling.

1356
01:49:29,271 --> 01:49:32,524
-Wait a minute. Not so soon.
-No, I gotta get back and convince them...

1357
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:35,819
...that I took the long way around
so nobody followed me.

1358
01:49:37,654 --> 01:49:39,948
Couldn't we stand like this
for just a few hours?

1359
01:49:40,115 --> 01:49:42,659
Just this time you're supposed
to be critically wounded.

1360
01:49:42,826 --> 01:49:44,828
I never felt more alive.

1361
01:49:44,995 --> 01:49:46,413
Well, whose side are you on?

1362
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:48,916
Yours, always, darling.

1363
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:52,920
Please don't undermine my resolve
just when I need it most.

1364
01:49:53,087 --> 01:49:54,505
[CAR HORN HONKING]

1365
01:50:01,512 --> 01:50:05,808
Oh, well, I guess it's off to the hospital
for me and back to danger for you.

1366
01:50:05,974 --> 01:50:07,684
I don't like it a bit.

1367
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:11,897
It's much safer now, thanks to you,
my darling decoy.

1368
01:50:12,064 --> 01:50:14,316
Don't thank me. I couldn't stand it.

1369
01:50:14,483 --> 01:50:16,068
All right. I won't.

1370
01:50:16,235 --> 01:50:19,488
After your malevolent friend Vandamm
takes off tonight...

1371
01:50:19,655 --> 01:50:23,826
...you and I are gonna get together and do a
lot of apologizing to each other in private.

1372
01:50:23,992 --> 01:50:27,287
-You know that can't be.
-Of course it can be.

1373
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:32,709
He has told you, hasn't he?

1374
01:50:33,210 --> 01:50:36,255
-Told me what?
-Miss Kendall, you gotta get moving.

1375
01:50:36,421 --> 01:50:39,716
-Wait a minute. What didn't you tell me?
-Why didn't you?

1376
01:50:40,717 --> 01:50:43,887
She's going off with Vandamm tonight
on the plane.

1377
01:50:45,430 --> 01:50:47,057
She's going off with Vandamm?

1378
01:50:47,224 --> 01:50:50,227
We went to such lengths
to make her a fugitive from justice.

1379
01:50:50,394 --> 01:50:53,397
So that Vandamm couldn't very well decline
to take her along.

1380
01:50:53,564 --> 01:50:56,400
I needn't tell you how valuable
she can be to us over there.

1381
01:50:57,359 --> 01:50:59,403
You lied to me.
You said that after tonight-

1382
01:50:59,570 --> 01:51:02,281
-I needed your help.
-Well, you got it, all right.

1383
01:51:02,447 --> 01:51:03,574
Don't be angry.

1384
01:51:03,740 --> 01:51:05,993
You think I'm gonna let you
go through with this?

1385
01:51:06,160 --> 01:51:08,829
-Oh, she has to.
-Nobody has to do anything.

1386
01:51:08,996 --> 01:51:11,081
I don't like the games
you play, professor.

1387
01:51:12,082 --> 01:51:15,043
War is hell, Mr. Thornhill,
even when it's a cold one.

1388
01:51:15,919 --> 01:51:18,338
If you can't lick the Vandamms
of this world...

1389
01:51:18,797 --> 01:51:21,717
...without asking girls to bed down
and fly away with them...

1390
01:51:21,884 --> 01:51:23,427
...and never come back...

1391
01:51:23,594 --> 01:51:26,263
...perhaps you ought to learn
how to lose a few cold wars.

1392
01:51:26,972 --> 01:51:29,474
I'm afraid we're already doing that.

1393
01:51:35,939 --> 01:51:40,235
-I'm not gonna let you do this. Get out.
-Please don't spoil everything. Please.

1394
01:51:45,324 --> 01:51:49,411
MAN [ON RADIO]: -Mr. Kaplan twice in full
view of horrified men, women and children...

1395
01:51:49,578 --> 01:51:52,956
...who had come to the park to see
the famed Mount Rushmore monument.

1396
01:51:53,123 --> 01:51:58,629
Witnesses described Kaplan's assailant
as an attractive blonde in her late twenties.

1397
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:02,591
Kaplan, who was removed to the
Rapid City Hospital in critical condition...

1398
01:52:02,758 --> 01:52:06,762
...has been tentatively identified
as an employee of the federal government.

1399
01:52:06,929 --> 01:52:09,348
The tragedy developed
with startling suddenness.

1400
01:52:09,514 --> 01:52:12,726
Chris Swenson,
a busboy in the Mount Rush more cafeteria...

1401
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:15,896
...stated that he heard voices raised in-

1402
01:52:21,985 --> 01:52:23,987
-Here we are.
-Hello.

1403
01:52:24,154 --> 01:52:26,823
Slacks, a shirt and these.

1404
01:52:26,990 --> 01:52:28,158
Thanks.

1405
01:52:28,325 --> 01:52:31,912
That'll do for you around here
for the next couple of days.

1406
01:52:32,663 --> 01:52:34,998
For the next couple of days?

1407
01:52:35,624 --> 01:52:36,667
-Hey.
-What?

1408
01:52:36,833 --> 01:52:37,918
What's this?

1409
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:41,213
That's where I hit the chair
doing that phony fall in the cafeteria.

1410
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:43,548
You and your dopey schemes, shootings.

1411
01:52:43,715 --> 01:52:47,511
-Otherwise, feeling all right?
-Oh, yeah. Fine.

1412
01:52:47,678 --> 01:52:50,806
Considering your driver
has a sledgehammer for a hand.

1413
01:52:50,973 --> 01:52:52,849
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1414
01:52:53,016 --> 01:52:55,560
No, that's all right. I guess I deserved it.

1415
01:52:56,353 --> 01:52:58,522
I guess I deserve that locked door too.

1416
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:02,609
You seen wandering about in good health
could've proved fatal to Miss Kendall.

1417
01:53:03,527 --> 01:53:06,530
-I've begun to forget her already.
-Good.

1418
01:53:06,697 --> 01:53:09,199
-Better that way.
-Yeah, much.

1419
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:11,994
Inside of an hour, she'll be gone.

1420
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:18,417
-How's everything out in Rapid City?
-Oh, everything's fine.

1421
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:22,629
Mr. Kaplan's untimely shooting has now
acquired the authority of the printed word.

1422
01:53:22,796 --> 01:53:25,257
Everyone's been cooperating beautifully.

1423
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:27,009
Well, now you can include me.

1424
01:53:27,718 --> 01:53:29,886
-I'm a cooperator.
-I'm most grateful.

1425
01:53:30,387 --> 01:53:33,473
-Care to do me a favor in return?
-Anything.

1426
01:53:33,640 --> 01:53:36,768
I'd like a drink. Will you get me a—?
Get me some bourbon?

1427
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:38,478
A pint will do.

1428
01:53:38,979 --> 01:53:40,063
Can I join you?

1429
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:43,358
Well, if you're gonna join me,
you better make it a quart.

1430
01:53:43,525 --> 01:53:46,361
-See you in a few minutes.
-Yeah.

1431
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:53,220
-Stop.
-Oh, excuse me.

1432
01:54:53,386 --> 01:54:55,138
Stop.

-No, thanks. Never mind.

01:55:21,998 --> 01:55:23,500

01:58:07,956 --> 01:58:11,334
VANDAMM: There's nothing to worry about.
EVE: I just lost my head.

1437
01:58:11,501 --> 01:58:14,588
VANDAMM: I'm not just saying this
to make you feel better.

1438
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:16,131
I mean it.

1439
01:58:16,298 --> 01:58:18,341
EVE:
I just didn't know what I was doing.

1440
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:21,011
VANDAMM: He wanted to destroy you.
You had to protect yourself.

VANDAMM: Ah, rubbish.

Soon we'll be off together and I shall
dedicate myself to your happiness.

01:58:32,022 --> 01:58:34,232

-Of course.

6000, descending.

And now, uh....

01:58:44,618 --> 01:58:47,537
I wonder if I might have a few words
of parting with you, sir?

1450
01:58:47,704 --> 01:58:49,331
Certainly.

Well, Leonard...

01:58:56,421 --> 01:59:00,258
...how does one say goodbye
to one's right arm?

1455
01:59:06,723 --> 01:59:09,351
I'm afraid you're gonna wish
you had cut it off sooner.

1456
01:59:11,186 --> 01:59:12,604
Mm-hm.

1457
01:59:13,938 --> 01:59:16,358
LEONARD: I know how terribly fond you are
of Miss Kendall....

1458
01:59:16,524 --> 01:59:19,444
I don't find this a terribly attractive....

1459
01:59:22,822 --> 01:59:26,034
-She is not to be trusted.
-You're being mysterious.

1460
01:59:26,201 --> 01:59:28,536
I'm not being mysterious at all.

1461
02:00:01,653 --> 02:00:03,655
It couldn't have been anything.

1462
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,786
You must've had some doubts
about her yourself.

1463
02:00:11,287 --> 02:00:13,957
-And still do.
VAN DAMM: Rubbish.

1464
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:16,960
LEONARD: Why else would
you have decided not to tell her...

1465
02:00:17,127 --> 02:00:19,921
...that our little treasure here
has a bellyful of microfilm?

1466
02:00:20,088 --> 02:00:22,465
You seem to be trying to fill mine
with rotten apples.

1467
02:00:22,632 --> 02:00:24,634
LEONARD: Sometimes the truth
does taste like worms.

1468
02:00:24,801 --> 02:00:27,095
The truth? I've heard nothing
but innuendoes.

1469
02:00:27,262 --> 02:00:31,099
Call it my woman's intuition if you will,
but I've never trusted neatness.

1470
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:33,685
Neatness is always the result
of deliberate planning.

1471
02:00:33,852 --> 02:00:36,312
She shot him in a moment
of fear and anger.

1472
02:00:36,479 --> 02:00:39,482
-You were there yourself. You saw it.
LEONARD: Yes.

1473
02:00:41,651 --> 02:00:46,322
And thereby wrapped everything up
into one very neat and tidy bundle.

1474
02:00:47,991 --> 02:00:50,869
A, she removed any doubts
you may have had about her, uh....

1475
02:00:51,035 --> 02:00:53,830
Now, what did you call it, her devotion?

1476
02:00:53,997 --> 02:00:58,251
B, she gave herself a new and urgent reason
to be taken to the other side with you...

1477
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:01,629
-...in case you decided to change your mind.
-You know what I think?

No, I mean it,

LEONARD:
The gun she shot Kaplan with.

1483
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:23,193
I found it in her luggage.

1484
02:01:24,444 --> 02:01:28,198
It's an old trick. Shoot one of your own
to show that you're not one of them.

1485

They've just freshened it up a bit

Yes, we wondered what it was too.
Didn't we, Leonard?

Of course I am.

Like our friends,
I too believe in neatness, Leonard.

1493

This matter is best disposed of
from a great height...

valuable attributes as it now turns out.

as being along on this journey...

EVE: I shall, Leonard.

1511
02:05:17,385 --> 02:05:20,805
LEONARD: He's heading pretty far out
on the north leg and awfully high.

1512
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:25,184
I guess he's gonna play it safe
with a long, slow descent.
