1
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,302
No, no, no. Get-- Get-- Back of the line, man.

2
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:36,555
- You're gonna let me in, right?
- No, no, no.

3
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,182
I got business to run here. Back of the--

4
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,560
- Yo, Maurice.
- Jack. Jackie Jack.

5
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,647
Jackie Jack. Jackie Jack. Jack, how you doing?

6
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,025
And Miss Lovely Amber Waves. Mwah.

7
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:49,401
- Hi, Maurice.
- <i>Como estas?</i>

8
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,613
- I've been pissed you haven't been around.
- Uh, we were on vacation.

9
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,616
Don't you ever stay away
from my club that long again, okay?

10
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,410
- You got it.
- And not for nothing, honey...

11
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,706
...but you are the sexiest bitch
in the entire county. I love you.

12
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:03,957
You're such a charmer.

13
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,335
Listen. I got your booth set up over there.

14
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:10,380
Some clams, I'm gonna send right over.
Listen, Jack. I'm ready, I'm available.

15
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,050
You put me in a movie, okay?
We're talking box office.

16
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,262
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Box office, Jack. Chi-Chi?

17
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:22,559
Chi-chi, listen. Jack and Amber's table.
Take them over an order of clams. Let's go.

18
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:25,687
Okay, how's it going here?

19
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,732
Listen, baby. Me and you,
we'll take a picture later on, okay?

20
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,233
I love you, baby.

21
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,613
How's it going? Hey, hey, hey. Yeah.

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,949
Hey, we were looking for you before, man.
Where were you, seriously?

23
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,535
- Yeah. Okay, I was here.
- Seriously, man.

24
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,579
Hmm.

25
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,957
- I love you.
- I love you, Beck. I love you, Beck.

26
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,460
Hey, Maurice. Hey, cowboy.

27
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,921
- Cow--? That's a cowboy?
- Cowboy.

28
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,589
- That's--
- There you go.

29
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,383
- You like it? It's nice, right?
- Yeah.

30
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,593
- If you like it, it's okay.
- I love it, man.

31
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,845
- Okay.
- All right.

32
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,264
- Cool. Real cool.
- Thanks, man.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,392
- Compliments of Maurice.
- Oh, thank you.

34
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:07,062
- Can I get a margarita, please?
- Uh, 7-Up.

35
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,234
- Hi, Rollergirl.
- Hi.

36
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,112
- Did you call that girl today?
- I forgot.

37
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:19,282
If you don't do it tomorrow, it'll be the
weekend, you'll never be able to see her.

38
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:20,909
Okay.

39
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,744
What's the matter down there?

40
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,456
- I gotta go pee.
- Well, go then.

41
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,298
What's happening?

42
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,509
What's happening?

43
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:40,303
Guys, let's get the album.

44
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,888
- Hey, Jack.
- Little Bill.

45
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,348
- Hi.
- Hi, Amber. How are you?

46
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:28,185
Uh, how's our schedule?
Are we still on for day after tomorrow?

47
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,520
More like the day after the day after tomorrow.

48
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:34,024
Jack, come on. I gotta call Rocky, Scotty,
Kurt. I gotta call those guys.

49
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:37,527
I wanna keep a small group on this one.
A small crew. Know what I mean?

50
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:39,404
- A low-key deal?
- Exactly.

51
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,198
Well--

52
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:44,951
I mean, do--? I'm sorry.
Do we--? Do we have a script?

53
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,898
- Hey.
- Hey

54
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,652
- So how you doing?
- Fine.

55
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:22,572
- How old are you?
- I have a work permit. I have all the papers--

56
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,408
No, it's nothing like that.
You been working here long?

57
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,494
A month.

58
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,746
- Maurice give you the job?
- Yeah.

59
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,125
You from around here? I mean, uh, Canoga? Reseda?

60
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,921
- Um, no. You know where Torrance is?
- Yeah. How do you get here?

61
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,006
Take the bus.

62
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,635
- So, what do you wanna be?
- Excuse me?

63
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,931
Well, I mean, you take the bus from Torrance
to come here to Reseda to do this job.

64
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,600
Can't you get a job like this in Torrance?

65
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:54,855
- Yeah, but I don't want to.
- Oh, okay.

66
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,818
So...

67
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,321
...you want 5 or 10?

68
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,282
What?

69
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:09,077
Well, if you just wanna see me jack off, it's 10.

70
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,289
But if you just wanna look at it, it's only 5.

71
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:16,042
- Guys pay you to watch you, do they?
- Yeah.

72
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,962
- You already done it tonight?
- Couple times.

73
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:22,799
- And you can do it again?
- If you want. If you got 10 bucks.

74
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,969
No.

75
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,637
My name is Jack.

76
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,681
Eddie. Eddie Adams.

77
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:32,976
- Eddie Adams from Torrance.
- Yup.

78
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,312
- Jack Horner, filmmaker.
- Really?

79
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,983
Yeah. I make, uh, adult films, exotic pictures.

80
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,028
Ah, I know who you are.
I read about you in a magazine.

81
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,196
<i>Inside Amber, Amanda's Ride. You made those.</i>

82
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,698
- Right.
- Those are great.

83
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,658
So now you know...

84
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,702
- ...I'm not full of doggy doo-doo.
- Heh, yeah.

85
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,747
Wanna come back to the table
and, uh, you know, have a drink with me?

86
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,583
Uh, I'd love to, but I gotta work.

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,336
You have to work, get money,
you know, pay the rent.

88
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,463
Well, yea-- I mean, no.

89
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:04,257
I need money, but I don't pay rent.
I still live at home.

90
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:07,260
How old are you, Eddie?

91
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:09,512
Seventeen.

92
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:13,224
Seventeen-year-old piece of gold.

93
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:15,727
- Heh, yeah, right.
- Why don't you come to the table?

94
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:19,397
- I got some people I'd like you to meet.
- I do know you. I know who you are.

95
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,026
I'd love to come to your table for a drink.
Obviously, you're not full of, um--

96
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,361
- Doggy doo-doo.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:28,239
But I just couldn't walk out on Maurice.
I'm really sorry.

98
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,617
Yeah.

99
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:35,288
I got a feeling, beneath those jeans there's
something wonderful just waiting to get out.

100
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:49,719
- Hey, guys.
- Bill. What's up?

101
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:53,765
- Not a lot. What are you guys up to?
- Don't know, probably just go home.

102
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:56,601
- I'll see you guys later.
- What are you still doing here?

103
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:59,270
- Can I sleep at your place?
- Half-hour, I'll be there.

104
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,439
- Bye, Maurice.
- Good night.

105
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,650
Hey, listen. Thank you.

106
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,235
Love you, <i>mamita</i>. Take care.

107
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,113
This is the man that you let in anytime,
you understand?

108
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,240
- Ha, ha.
- All right.

109
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,743
<i>- Luego.
- Hasta mañana.</i>

110
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,750
Fix you some eggs, beauty?

111
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,962
No. I'm going to sleep. Good night.

112
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,923
Good night, honey-tits. Sleep beautiful.

113
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,591
Okay.

114
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:05,336
Tom? Hi. Yeah, it's me.

115
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,881
I know that it's late, but I--

116
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,341
ls Andy there? Is he?

117
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,012
I'd like to say hello.

118
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:18,058
I'd like to say hello to my son, and that's all.

119
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,105
Let me tell you something.

120
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:27,692
Let me tell you something you don't know.
I know a lawyer. You understand?

121
00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:31,988
You might think I don't, but I do,
and I'll take you to court.

122
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,997
Tom, don't. Come on, Torn.
Please. Please. Please.

123
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,225
What the fuck are you doing?

124
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:46,062
What the fuck does it look like I'm doing?

125
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,397
Can you close the door?

126
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,817
Will I close the door?

127
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,154
Will I close the door?
That's my wife, you asshole.

128
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:57,574
Uh, I'm sorry.

129
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,327
Get out. Go sleep on the couch.

130
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:03,955
Don't stop, big stud.

131
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,844
Yeah. That's right.

132
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,505
Oh, Jesus, please, okay?
Shave if you're gonna do that.

133
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:20,883
- You scratch my face.
- Sorry.

134
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,434
- Good morning.
- Hey.

135
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:36,274
How's it at work? You get home late, huh?

136
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,235
- Yeah.
- You know, you work in a nightclub.

137
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:42,238
If it means so much to you,
you should find one that's closer.

138
00:13:42,405 --> 00:13:43,448
Yeah.

139
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:47,076
I gotta get to work.

140
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:49,454
- At a car wash.
- What?

141
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,914
You work at a car wash. You work at a nightclub.

142
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:54,083
School never occurred to you?

143
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,889
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

144
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:14,604
So basically, you're getting
twice the bass with the TK-421

145
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:17,315
...which we've, uh, got available
in this system right here.

146
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,444
I don't know.
I don't really know if I need all that bass.

147
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:23,946
Oh, I think you need all that bass.

148
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,616
Heh, I mean, if you want a system
to handle what you want...

149
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,118
...yeah, you need the bass.

150
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,289
See, this-- This is hi-fi, okay?

151
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,250
High fidelity. Know what that means?

152
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:39,462
That means this is the highest quality fidelity.

153
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:43,424
Hi-fi. Those are two very important things
to have in a stereo system.

154
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,845
- It's the price. For the 420--
- I have this very unit in my home.

155
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,806
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

156
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,475
Of course, I got it modified with the TK-421

157
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:54,477
...which, uh, kicks it up another...

158
00:14:54,644 --> 00:15:00,525
...I don't know, maybe three or four, um,
quads per channel, you know.

159
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:04,237
But that's really-- That's technical talk.
That doesn't really concern you.

160
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,240
Still a little uncertain, aren't you?

161
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:08,658
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

162
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:11,244
You know what you need? You need a test drive.

163
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,413
That's what you need. You need a test drive.

164
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:17,875
It's one thing to hear it from Buck's mouth,
it's another to hear it from the TK-421.

165
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,919
So let me just pop in this 8-track...

166
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:22,463
...and you just give a listen,
tell me what you think, okay?

167
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,593
Whoo. Huh?

168
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,888
You hear that? You hear the bass? Right?

169
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,682
You hear it? It kicks.

170
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:37,812
It turns. It curls up your belly.
Makes you wanna freaky-deaky, right?

171
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,898
Heh, you got that?
Now, see, if you get this system as is...

172
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:44,193
...it's not gonna sound like this
without the TK-421 modification...

173
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,530
...and we do that in the store right here,
very small price.

174
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:50,741
Go on and move with it if you need to.
It helps me.

175
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,369
Thank you for your time.

176
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:56,581
Oh, okay. Well, hey. So long, partner.

177
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,126
- What the fuck was that?
- What?

178
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,878
- Have I told you?
- Have-- What?

179
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,963
- Have I?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

180
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:07,925
You put on that country-western shit,
no one's gonna buy a stereo.

181
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,678
What kind of brother are you, anyway?
Listening to that shit.

182
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,347
- All right. Look, Jerry--
- No, no, no. You look.

183
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,391
I gave you a job here because, you know...

184
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:19,395
...I thought your acting stuff might bring
some nice pussy into the place, and it has.

185
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:23,566
But I can't have any more fuckups. You dig?

186
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:24,775
Yeah.

187
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,777
- You dig?
- Yeah. I dig.

188
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,281
Okay, now get in the back
and, uh, unload those new 484s.

189
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,950
All right. Sorry, I was just--

190
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,912
Settle down, class. Settle down.

191
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,623
This is your final.

192
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,585
Keep your test papers face down
until I tell you to turn them up.

193
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,421
Clear your tables, please.

194
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:49,675
There should be nothing on your desk
but your test paper and a pencil.

195
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:54,388
We're covering chapters 17 through 28.

196
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,768
Your eyes should stay on your test paper, please.

197
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,978
Are we ready?

198
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,481
Class, begin.

199
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:34,220
<i>I love to suck cock. I love to suck cock.</i>

200
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:51,153
Honey? You okay? Sweetheart? ls something wrong?

201
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,992
- I gotta get back.
- I need it once more.

202
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,161
- I have to go back to work.
- Come on. Give it to me, Eddie.

203
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:01,163
Don't make me pounce you, Sheryl Lynn.

204
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,249
- Ooh, baby, baby, baby.
- I'll do it.

205
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,793
- You promise?
- Oh, that's it.

206
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,420
- You want it?
- Yeah.

207
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,171
- How bad?
- Bad.

208
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,007
- You sure?
- Yeah.

209
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,174
You asked for it.

210
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,347
Oh, God. Wait.

211
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,560
Stop. Stop.

212
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,353
What?

213
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,236
Your cock is so beautiful.

214
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,155
Yeah?

215
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,033
Do you know how good you are at doing it, Eddie?

216
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,995
Having sex? Fucking me? Making love to me'?

217
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,291
Everyone has one thing, you think?

218
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,960
I mean, everyone's given
one special thing, right?

219
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,962
That's right.

220
00:18:52,423 --> 00:18:54,592
Everyone's blessed with one special thing.

221
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,262
Hey.

222
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:03,768
I want you to know I plan on being a star.

223
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:06,395
A big, bright shining star.

224
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:10,274
That's what I want. That's what I'm gonna get.

225
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,193
I know.

226
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,153
I gotta go.

227
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,448
You're lucky.

228
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:56,404
Hi.

229
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,321
- Eddie.
- Hi.

230
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,823
- Want a ride?
- Jack?

231
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:44,660
- Yeah. Want a ride?
- Hi. Uh, well, I'm going really far.

232
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,246
Do you remember me from a couple hours ago?

233
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,415
Yeah, I remember.

234
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,543
Come with us, sweetie.

235
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,587
Okay.

236
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,553
This is a really cool car, Jack.

237
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,186
So, what I'm trying to tell you, Eddie...

238
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:15,316
...is that it takes a lot
of the good, old American green stuff...

239
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,486
...to make one of these things,
you know what I mean?

240
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:22,531
I mean, you know, you've got your camera,
you've got your film...

241
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,910
...you got your lights, you got your sound,
you got your lab costs...

242
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,413
...you got your developing,
YOU 90'! your synching, you got your editing.

243
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:36,295
Before you turn around, you've spent
maybe 20-, 25-, $30,000 on a movie.

244
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:39,423
- Wow, that's a lot of money.
- You bet your ass it is.

245
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,383
But if you make a good one...

246
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,720
...there's practically no end
to how much money you can make.

247
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,556
- Have you seen Jack's house?
- No.

248
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,851
- He Will.
- He'll see it.

249
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,188
You got maybe 15, 20 guys standing around...

250
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,942
...just making sure that your lighting is right.

251
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,445
But you can work out in the morning,
you can work out at noon...

252
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,489
...you can work out at night.

253
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,784
It doesn't matter
if you don't have those juices flowing...

254
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:11,747
...down there in the Mr. Torpedo area,
in the fun zone...

255
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,416
...but you gotta get the people in the theater.

256
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,752
You know, you need the big dicks, the big tits.

257
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,380
Uh-oh. Here we go.

258
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:23,092
How do you keep them in the theater
after they've come?

259
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:25,511
With beauty...

260
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,806
...and with acting.

261
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:33,519
Now, I understand you've gotta
get them in the theater, you know?

262
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,104
You gotta keep the seats full.

263
00:22:35,521 --> 00:22:39,275
But I don't wanna make a film
where they show up, they sit down...

264
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,820
...they jack off, and they get up
and they get out before the story ends.

265
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:48,617
It is my dream, it is my goal,
it is my idea to make a film...

266
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,788
...that the story just sucks them in...

267
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:58,127
...and when they spurt out that joy juice,
they just gotta sit in it.

268
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:04,758
They can't move
until they find out how the story ends.

269
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:09,638
You know, aah, I wanna make a film like that.

270
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,266
And I understand,
you know, they have to make films--

271
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,978
I've made them myself,
you know, that are a few laughs...

272
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:19,523
...everybody fucks their brains out,
and that's fine.

273
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:23,819
But it's my dream to make a film...

274
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,114
...that is true...

275
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:31,952
...and right and dramatic.

276
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,955
You sure you don't want a Fresca?

277
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,540
- No, thanks.
- Are you sure?

278
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:38,834
- Yeah.
- You're out of limes, Jack.

279
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,754
Well, check in the kitchen, darling.

280
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,507
I'm going to bed.

281
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,844
Good night, Jackie. Don't stay up too late.

282
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,846
Good night, beauty.

283
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,223
- Good night, Eddie.
- Good night.

284
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:55,434
Glad you came by.

285
00:23:57,353 --> 00:24:00,272
- You're great.
- Oh, thank you.

286
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:07,029
She's the best.

287
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,240
She's a wonderful mother, you know?

288
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:13,702
She's a mother to all those who need love.

289
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,538
- She's really nice.
- Yeah.

290
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:22,836
You know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking,
I wanna be in business with you, Eddie.

291
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,506
- Really?
- Yeah. What do you think?

292
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:27,549
I'd love it.

293
00:24:28,634 --> 00:24:30,511
What do you think of Rollergirl?

294
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:33,347
- She's great.
- Yeah.

295
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:36,308
- Would you like to do it?
- Have sex?

296
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,979
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. I mean, I'd love to.

297
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,399
- She's really foxy.
- Oh, you bet your ass she is.

298
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,401
You're officially out of limes, Jack.

299
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:48,070
Well, I'll pick up some for you
tomorrow or something.

300
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,363
Come here, darling.

301
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,534
I want you to go over there
and sit on the couch with Eddie.

302
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:55,619
Here we go. Are we gonna fuck?

303
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:59,707
- Oh, yes.
- Ha, ha. Wait a minute.

304
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,763
- Are you ready?
- Yeah. Are you?

305
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,765
Oh, yeah.

306
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,438
Are you gonna take your skates off?

307
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:25,065
I don't take my skates off.

308
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,276
- And don't fucking come in.
- Okay.

309
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:30,988
Aim it at her tits, Eddie.

310
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:57,222
- Hi.
- Where were you?

311
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,642
- Nowhere.
- Shut up. Where were you?

312
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,646
You see that little slut girl you see?
Sheryl? Sheryl Lynn?

313
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,565
Don't say that.

314
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,985
Make you feel like a stud to see trash like that?

315
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,822
- She your girlfriend?
- No, she's not my girlfr--

316
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,159
She's a little whore and a little piece of trash.

317
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:19,995
And I know you're not the only one she sees.

318
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:23,707
- Why would you say something like that?
- I heard things about her, that girl.

319
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:26,460
Don't think I don't know what goes on
when I'm not here.

320
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:30,506
I wash your sheets. I know she's been here.
Or you doing something else in there...

321
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,841
...with your music and your posters on the wall?

322
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,178
- What is your problem?
- Okay, fine. All right. Just go.

323
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:39,181
Go to that whore Sheryl Lynn.
Why don't you just go to her?

324
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,849
- Yeah. Well, maybe I will.
- Yeah?

325
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,351
- Yeah.
- What are you gonna do?

326
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,771
- I don't know. I'll do something.
- You can't do anything.

327
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:48,273
You're a loser. You'll always be a loser.

328
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,443
You couldn't even finish high school
because you were so stupid.

329
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,737
- So, what are you gonna do?
<i>- I'll</i> do something.

330
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,740
I'll go somewhere.
I'll run away where you can never find me.

331
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,617
Go ahead and fuck that little girl.

332
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:04,331
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm getting my stuff.

333
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,210
You think that's your stuff?
That's not your stuff. You didn't pay for it.

334
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:11,588
That is not your stuff
because you didn't pay for it, stupid!

335
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,424
None of this is yours! This--

336
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,011
You leave here, you leave with what you've got!

337
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:21,306
Nothing! Nothing!

338
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:25,144
You understand me?
You want to treat me like this?

339
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:27,688
- This is what happens, okay?
- I didn't do anything.

340
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,107
You want to live that way?
Fuck that little whore!

341
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:33,402
You think you're gonna be this?
You think you're gonna be this?

342
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,945
Goddamn poster!

343
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:38,031
Don't do that! Don't do that!
Why are you doing that?

344
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,576
You're not gonna be shit
because you're too stupid!

345
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,619
- I'm not stupid!
- Yes, you are!

346
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:46,248
Please, please. Don't fucking do that.
Please don't be mean to me.

347
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,168
I'm not being mean to you.
You're just too stupid to see it.

348
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:53,255
You don't know what I can do,
what I'm gonna do, or what I'm gonna be.

349
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:56,466
You don't know. I'm good.
I have good things you don't know about.

350
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:57,968
I'm gonna be something! I am!

351
00:27:58,135 --> 00:28:00,762
- Don't fucking tell me I'm not!
- You can't do anything.

352
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:04,433
Don't be mean! And you don't talk to me! No!

353
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,351
Fuck.

354
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:19,072
Eddie Adams from Torrance.

355
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:21,200
I knew you'd make it.

356
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,578
- You take the bus the whole way here?
- Yeah. It wasn't bad, though.

357
00:28:24,745 --> 00:28:26,121
- How are you?
- Oh, great.

358
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,415
I got some people I want you to meet.

359
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,882
- Do you like music?
- I love music.

360
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:40,010
- What kind?
- All kinds of music. Rock, jazz, classical.

361
00:28:40,177 --> 00:28:42,763
Oh, I want you to meet a couple of great people.

362
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:45,933
- Buck and Becky.
- Hi. I'm Eddie. Eddie Adams.

363
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,810
- Buck Swope. Nice to meet you.
- Our new fella.

364
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,979
- Becky Barnett.
- It's nice to meet you.

365
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,189
Oh, this is the new fella?

366
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:53,523
- Oh, ho.
- Oh, ho.

367
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,317
- Is that a faccia?
- That is a faccia.

368
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,195
- I didn't know you'd be so precious.
- Faccia's "face," right?

369
00:28:58,362 --> 00:28:59,571
- That's right.
- Yeah.

370
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:03,158
- Nice to meet you, guys.
- All right.

371
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:05,160
- Great people.
- Oh, yeah.

372
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,912
He's one hell of an actor.

373
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,748
Hey, Reed. Reed-o.

374
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,961
I want you to meet the new boy on the street.

375
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,462
Eddie Adams.

376
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,965
- Hi. I'm Eddie.
- Hi, Eddie. Reed Rothchild.

377
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,093
- I want you to stick around for a while.
- Sure.

378
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,096
- Make him something special.
- Aye, aye.

379
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,015
- So you live on this street?
- No, no.

380
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,559
Oh, I thought Jack just said you did.

381
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,353
- Na - Hmm.

382
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,646
- Want a drink?
- Sure.

383
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:35,190
- Margarita?
- Great.

384
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,192
Wow.

385
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:44,032
Two, four, mm-hm, whatever.

386
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,745
- Can I ask you something?
- Uh-huh.

387
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,831
- Do you work out?
- Yeah.

388
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,375
Yeah. You look like it. What do you squat?

389
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:56,920
- About two.
- Super, super.

390
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:58,964
What about you?

391
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,508
What do you squat?

392
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:04,386
- Three-fifty.
- Wow.

393
00:30:04,553 --> 00:30:06,888
- No B.S.
- That's a lot.

394
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,725
- Where do you work out?
- In Torrance, where I live.

395
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:11,393
Cool. Cool.

396
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,689
Hey, you ever go to Vince's out here?
Oh, no. I would have seen you.

397
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:18,900
- I'm there every day.
- I've always wanted to work out at Vince's.

398
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,237
Cool. Here. Taste that.

399
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,952
- Ahem, rock 'n' roll.
- Right?

400
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:35,167
- Did you ever see that movie Star Wars?
- Oh, about four times.

401
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:39,212
- People tell me I look like Han Solo.
- Really?

402
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,674
What do you bench?

403
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:45,218
You tell first.

404
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,220
I asked you first.

405
00:30:47,387 --> 00:30:49,139
Same time.

406
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,724
Cool.

407
00:30:50,891 --> 00:30:52,601
- Are you ready?
- Ready.

408
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:56,396
One, two, three...

409
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,523
- You didn't say anything.
- Oh, neither did you.

410
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,443
Hey, guys. Look at me.

411
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:21,171
Thank you, Johnny. My dear, it's party time.

412
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:24,466
Oh, do you look lovely. Mm.

413
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:28,428
- Hello, Colonel. How are you?
- Oh, hello, Jack. Ha-ha-ha.

414
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:30,597
Hi. This is my lady friend.

415
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:34,434
Darling, I'd like you to meet Jack Horner,
the finest director in the business.

416
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:35,644
- Hi.

417
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:37,437
Do you have any coke at this party?

418
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,315
- They can find some somewhere. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

419
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,484
- Great.
- You're no bigger than a minute?

420
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,652
Uh-uh. Ha, ha.

421
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:45,570
- Shy as a butterfly.
- I'll bet.

422
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:50,075
He has every right to tell me
how to sell stereos. It's his store, I'll listen.

423
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,577
He does not have the right
to tell me how to dress.

424
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,704
Where's he get off telling me how to dress, huh?

425
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,666
- It's old. It's just plain old.
- No, wait. Let me tell you--

426
00:31:57,833 --> 00:31:59,918
He was obviously pissed off about the music.

427
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,255
- What's wrong with it?
- The cowboy look ended six years ago.

428
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,675
- It's coming back though, Becky.
- No, it's not. It's over. It's dead, okay?

429
00:32:06,842 --> 00:32:08,844
I don't think you know what you're talking about.

430
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,012
I do know what I'm talking about.

431
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:13,849
Your bosses at the stereo store
are saying the same thing.

432
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:17,018
- What? What?
- You have to get a new look.

433
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,020
What? You get a new look.

434
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,481
I have a look, okay?
The look I have is just fine.

435
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,526
- What's your look?
- Chocolate love, all right?

436
00:32:24,693 --> 00:32:26,445
- Oh, take a pill.
- One hundred percent.

437
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,239
You don't have to lash out.
I'm trying to be your friend.

438
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,534
- Okay, Becky. Drop it.
- I tried opening up a club there, you know?

439
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:36,329
But you see, Miss Amber, I'm just this
poor fellow from Puerto Rico, you know?

440
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,373
I got this club. Yeah, that's one thing.

441
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:41,835
But soon that goes, I die,
then what do I have? I got nothing.

442
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,044
Mm-hm.

443
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,464
You know, I want something
I can send home, you know?

444
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,427
Something I can send to my brothers
and say, "Look at me.

445
00:32:50,594 --> 00:32:53,889
Look at me and all the beautiful women
I've been with."

446
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:56,558
So what? You want me to talk to Jack?

447
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,437
Yeah. I mean, you know.
I mean, what am I asking you here?

448
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:02,814
Honey, Amber, baby, please, talk to Jack.

449
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,400
Tell him I can do this. Tell him I won't be bad.

450
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,111
- So you wanna be in a movie?
- Baby, please.

451
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:10,530
<i>- I'll</i> see what I can do.
- Would you, love?

452
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,282
Thank you very much.

453
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:13,492
Thank you, <i>mamita.</i>

454
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:19,789
Maurice, can I talk to you?
I need to talk to you now.

455
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,083
- Now?
- Yeah. We gotta go in here.

456
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,919
- Excuse me.
- Hi.

457
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,087
Can I join in'?

458
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:27,881
Most certainly.

459
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:31,551
- Your cowboy--? That's not dead.
- Then what is Becky talking about?

460
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,554
- She's got something up her ass.
- Fuck that shit.

461
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,348
Bitch.

462
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:58,119
- Do a cannonball.
- No, no. Watch this jackknife.

463
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:06,795
- Did it look cool?
- That was pretty good.

464
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,089
Let me show you what you did wrong.

465
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,853
Full flip.

466
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,071
Whoa.

467
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:40,829
Ow.

468
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,290
- You all right?
- Yeah.

469
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,209
Hey, you gotta bring your legs
all the way around.

470
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:49,129
I know. I know.

471
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,048
- Hey, hey, hey. This is my point.
- What?

472
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,050
- Okay, you know what I say?
- What?

473
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,136
Wear what you dig.

474
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,888
That's it. Just wear what you dig.

475
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:02,142
- That's what I said.
- Well, what's the problem?

476
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,688
- Should I get that?
- Yeah.

477
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:10,066
Hello? Uh-huh.

478
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,402
Uh, can you speak a little louder, please?

479
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:15,989
A who? A Ma--? A Maggie. You know a Maggie?

480
00:35:16,156 --> 00:35:19,951
- I don't know a Maggie.
- Uh, look, sorry. There's no Maggie here.

481
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:24,831
Your-- Your mother. Oh, okay. Just give me a sec.

482
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:27,334
Watch that for me, okay?

483
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:33,548
Uh, excuse me, is Maggie here?
Maggie? Are you Maggie?

484
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:37,177
No? Do you know? Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.

485
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,012
Do you know Maggie?

486
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,475
- Are you Maggie?
- No.

487
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,353
Oh, man. Can you believe this?

488
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,106
Hello? Yeah, listen.
I'm sorry, there's no Maggie here.

489
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:53,818
Okay. No, no. It's not a problem. Okay. Ciao.

490
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,114
- Who was that?
- Oh, some kid looking for his mom.

491
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:49,416
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What's it look like they're doing?

492
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,750
That's my wife.

493
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:54,879
Shut up, Bill. You're embarrassing me.

494
00:36:55,255 --> 00:36:57,716
Yeah, Little Bill. Shut up.

495
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,522
- Little Bill.
- Hey, Kurt. How's it going?

496
00:37:12,689 --> 00:37:15,608
- What's wrong with you?
- Oh, my fucking wife, man.

497
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,736
She's down there, some idiot's dick in her.

498
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,156
Everybody's standing around watching.
It's a fucking embarrassment.

499
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,658
Yeah, yeah. I know. Anyway, listen.

500
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:26,161
- Yeah.
- For the shoot, I wanna talk about the look.

501
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:28,413
- See about getting this new zoom lens.
- Right.

502
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,499
I was wondering if we'd be able
to look into getting more lights.

503
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,042
Jack wants a minimal thing.

504
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:36,671
Yeah, well, very often minimal means
a lot more photographically, I think--

505
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:39,507
- Well, I think than most people understand.
- I understand.

506
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,594
No, I know you understand.
I'm talking about some other people.

507
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,263
I think what Jack is talking about is minimal.

508
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,390
Not really natural, but minimal.

509
00:37:47,557 --> 00:37:50,226
- Okay, fine. Uh, I was just saying--
- I understand.

510
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,188
Yeah, because I'm trying
to give each picture its own look.

511
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,357
- Can we talk about this later?
- Oh, yeah.

512
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,818
You gotta go somewhere, or...?

513
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,446
Yeah. No. I mean, unh--

514
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,448
I was hoping for the shoot tomorrow...

515
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:06,034
...we could send Rocky down
and he could pick it up.

516
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,911
- Kurt.
- No, hey. Got you.

517
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:10,205
You gotta go somewhere, so, hey, what the fuck?

518
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:13,041
It's only the photography of the film
we're talking about.

519
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:16,961
- Are you giving me shit, Kurt?
- No. Hey, no way, Little Bill.

520
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,381
My fucking wife has an ass in her cock
in the driveway, Kurt.

521
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,551
All right? I'm sorry if my thoughts
are not on the photography...

522
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,722
- ...of the film we're shooting tomorrow.
- Okay. No big deal. Sorry.

523
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:30,767
- All right?
- Gotcha.

524
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,032
All right, where is it?

525
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,083
I think she's sick.

526
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,254
- Oh, what the fuck is this?
- I didn't do anything. I-- I didn't--

527
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,548
- Is she breathing?
- I don't know.

528
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,717
- I think maybe she did too much coke.
- Do you think so, doctor?

529
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:07,220
- This girl's definitely OD'd.
- Oh, fuck me. Okay.

530
00:39:07,387 --> 00:39:09,222
I want you to handle this for me, Johnny.

531
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:10,473
- You listening?
- Yeah.

532
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,894
Get her in the car, drive her to Saint Joe's.
Drop her off in the front. I don't want any--

533
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,814
- Got you.
- Make sure no one sees the limo.

534
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:20,525
- Got it.
- What the fuck is this?

535
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:24,279
This is twice in two days
that a chick has OD'd on me.

536
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,448
You think maybe you ought to
think about getting some new shit?

537
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:28,658
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

538
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:32,120
- Oh, shit. She's freaking out.
- Oh, see? Look at this.

539
00:39:32,287 --> 00:39:34,747
With all this fucking conversation.
Come on. Come on.

540
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,876
- Please don't die.
- Hey, hey.

541
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,961
Come on!

542
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,966
- Back door, Johnny.
- You got it.

543
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,176
Fucking shit.

544
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,725
Get out of my way.

545
00:39:55,268 --> 00:39:58,187
- Bart, is she all right?
- Shut the fuck up.

546
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,303
- Hey, Reed.
- Hey, Scotty J. How are you?

547
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:33,514
You know, you know. Ha, ha, who's this?

548
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:37,185
Eddie, this is Scotty J. He's a friend.
He works on some of the films.

549
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,103
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, yeah. Me too.

550
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,897
Uh, you gonna be working, or...?

551
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,857
- Um, maybe.
- Oh.

552
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,860
- Probably. Ha, ha.
- That's great. Ha, ha.

553
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,280
How'd you meet Jack? Because I work
on the films, you know, sometimes.

554
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,908
- So if you ever, yeah...
- Hey, Eddie.

555
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,287
- Come here a second.
- That's the boy you told me about.

556
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,706
Uh, could you excuse me for a minute?

557
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,875
- Yeah.
- Very nice to meet you.

558
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,127
- Take care.
- Yeah.

559
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:08,591
- Hey.
- Eddie Adams, this is the Colonel.

560
00:41:08,758 --> 00:41:10,718
- Hi.
- How do you do, Eddie?

561
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:13,221
Eddie is, uh, interested in film.

562
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:17,058
Oh. I can't give you much advice
that Jack probably doesn't know...

563
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,686
...but I can advise
that you think about your name.

564
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:20,895
My name. Yeah.

565
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:23,898
Like, think about some name that makes you happy.

566
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,651
- Something with a little pizzazz, you know?
- Sure.

567
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:32,323
You see, Eddie, the Colonel here,
he puts up all the money for our films.

568
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,742
It's an important part of the process.

569
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,662
- Oh. Great, great.
- I'm looking forward to seeing you in action.

570
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,916
- Jack says you got a great big cock.
- Um, well, heh, I don't know. I guess so.

571
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:43,835
May I see it?

572
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,962
- Really?
- Please. Yeah.

573
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,755
Okay.

574
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,055
- Well, thank you, Eddie.
- No problem.

575
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,766
- Thanks, Eddie.
- Bye.

576
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,754
- You wanna hear a poem I wrote?
- Yeah.

577
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,422
Okay.

578
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:35,928
<i>I love you, you love me Going down the sugar tree</i>

579
00:42:36,137 --> 00:42:40,975
<i>We'll go down the sugar tree And see lots of bees</i>

580
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,353
<i>Playing, playing</i>

581
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:48,816
<i>But the bees won't sting Because you love me</i>

582
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,402
- That's it.
- That's fucking great. Did you write that?

583
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,490
- Yeah. I write songs too. I'm still working--
- How's it going, boys?

584
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,742
Hey, Jack.

585
00:42:58,618 --> 00:42:59,660
Having a good time?

586
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,330
Excellent time. Thank you, Jack.
It was a great party.

587
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:05,792
- The best.
- Ah, that's what Jackie's house is for.

588
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,835
To have a good time. Right?

589
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:09,504
- That's right.
- Coming in.

590
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,674
- Woo-hoo. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

591
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,054
- Ah, how about a little bubbles?
- Oh, yeah.

592
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,475
- Excuse me, Jack.
- Yeah?

593
00:43:22,642 --> 00:43:25,394
I was thinking about what the Colonel
was saying, about my name.

594
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:28,189
Uh-huh.
- I was just wondering if you had any ideas.

595
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:31,776
I had some thoughts on it, yeah.
What about you? What do you think?

596
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:35,530
Well, my idea was--
You know, I just want a name--

597
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:38,366
I want it so it can cut glass,
you know, like razor-sharp.

598
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,826
Razor-sharp. Right.

599
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:43,871
Yeah, well, when I close my eyes,
I see this thing. It's like this big sign.

600
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,541
And the name is in,
like, bright-blue neon lights...

601
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:49,043
...with, like, purple outline.

602
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:54,006
And this name is just so bright and so sharp
that the sign, it just blows up...

603
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:57,218
...because the name is just so powerful.

604
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,312
It says, "Dirk Diggler."

605
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:13,734
I think-- I think heaven has sent you here,
Dirk Diggler.

606
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:18,823
I think the angels have blessed us all
because of you.

607
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:22,285
- You're Dirk. Ha, ha.
- Dirk Diggler, ha, ha.

608
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,412
Amen.

609
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,587
Talk to me, Kurt.

610
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,172
- Twenty to 30.
- Oy.

611
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,384
- I got a couple tough shadows to deal with.
- There's shadows in life, baby.

612
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,094
- Jack.
- Yo.

613
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:44,390
- You, uh, wanna go over this?
- Okay.

614
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:48,019
Uh, the setup is-- Okay, here we go.

615
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,104
Uh, "One, Amber talking to Becky.

616
00:44:50,271 --> 00:44:53,232
They make the telephone call to the agents
to send over some actors.

617
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:58,905
Two, enter Reed to audition for Amber.
They go at it. Becky watches.

618
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,741
Three, Becky goes to the bathroom to jack off.

619
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:04,577
She gets interrupted by Amber. They go at it.

620
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,621
Four..."

621
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:10,333
Who's "Dirk--? Dirk Diggler?"

622
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:14,045
That's that new, good-looking kid.
Eddie at the club.

623
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,296
- Good name.
- Yeah.

624
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:18,299
Anyway, uh, "Enter Dirk. He meets Becky.
They go at it."

625
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:22,803
No, ugh. Change that, will you? Uh--
I want Eddie to be auditioning for Amber.

626
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,639
Got it.

627
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:28,142
- Darling, where are you going?
- Huh? I gotta go wash my vagina.

628
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,686
- How long will you be?
- Two seconds.

629
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,688
You want it clean, don't you?

630
00:45:36,317 --> 00:45:38,402
I'm back now. I'm ready to start my--

631
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,031
- Come in.
- Hey.

632
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:44,158
- Hi.
- Ha, ha. Hi.

633
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:46,911
Dirk. Dirk Diggler.

634
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,957
- Scotty.
- Yeah, uh--

635
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:55,002
I'm supposed to come get you now
and tell you that they're all ready now.

636
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,630
- Okay.
- Yeah. Okay.

637
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:02,843
Do you think you could give me a minute?

638
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,888
Thanks.

639
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:14,188
I'm back now.
I'm ready to start my acting career.

640
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,199
That's right.

641
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,456
- Hey.
- Hey.

642
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,667
- You look really good.
- Oh, thank you.

643
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,836
Ahem. And you look really sexy.

644
00:46:37,003 --> 00:46:38,921
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

645
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,720
- I like your name a lot.
- You do?

646
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,346
Yeah. It's really cool.

647
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,557
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Heh.

648
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:56,605
You'll be right down there.

649
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:07,033
Thanks. Hey.

650
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:09,243
- Ho, how's my boy?
- Great.

651
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,661
- How you feeling?
- Let's do it.

652
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,288
Ha, ha. All right.

653
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,498
- Remember everything we talked about?
- Yeah.

654
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:18,711
Okay, now, you're gonna come through
the door, walk right over here...

655
00:47:18,878 --> 00:47:23,591
...I'll-- I'll say, uh, "Action, Eddie."
That'll be your cue, right?

656
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,552
You come through the door,
you walk over here to the desk...

657
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:29,638
...to Amber, and we shoot.

658
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:32,933
- Um, do we go right into the sex, or...?
- I need some more fill.

659
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,894
- Is that all right?
- Good.

660
00:47:35,061 --> 00:47:37,021
- Is it okay with you?
- That looks good.

661
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:39,440
- Amber?
- Good.

662
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,235
- Okay.
- Okay. You don't need a rehearsal?

663
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:45,029
No, it's okay. I can do it.

664
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:46,989
Okay, then we'll shoot the rehearsal.

665
00:47:47,156 --> 00:47:48,532
- Great.
- All right.

666
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,743
- Um, could I ask you something, Jack?
- Sure.

667
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,245
Um, I was wondering if you could, um...

668
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,290
...call me Dirk Diggler from now on.

669
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,792
- Absolutely.
- Great. Heh.

670
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,126
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. It's--

671
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,879
- No, no. From now on.
- Thanks.

672
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,881
Okay, let's get a good one.

673
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:07,385
- Do you wanna practice your lines with me?
- No, I know it.

674
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,637
- You look great, honey.
- Thanks.

675
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:12,056
Um, does he want me to keep going until I come?

676
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:15,643
- Yeah. You just come when you're ready.
- Okay. Well, where should I do it?

677
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:17,103
Where do you want?

678
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,438
Wherever you tell me.

679
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,482
Well, come on my tits if you can, okay?

680
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,777
Just pull it out and do it on my stomach
and my tits if you can.

681
00:48:24,944 --> 00:48:27,530
Yeah. No problem.

682
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,035
Are you all right, honey?

683
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:35,830
Oh, this is great. I'm fine.
I just wanna do good.

684
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,165
- I just want it to be really good.
- Mm-hm.

685
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:42,837
I was wondering, is it okay if I really try
to make it look sexy? Would that be okay?

686
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,339
- Okay.
- Great.

687
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,094
- You ready?
- Yeah.

688
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:53,931
Make your entrance through this door.
He'll call, "Action." That's your cue.

689
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:56,016
- You got the lines for the scene?
- Uh-huh.

690
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,727
If you drop one, just call for it,
but do not stop, okay?

691
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,521
Do not stop. You want some water?

692
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:03,441
- No, I'm fine. Thanks.
- Okay. You're gonna do fine.

693
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:05,776
Roll it, Scotty.

694
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,904
Speed. Ahem.

695
00:49:09,572 --> 00:49:10,865
- Sticks.
- Marker.

696
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:13,492
- Yeah?
- Camera's set.

697
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,828
- We're ready, chief.
- Okay.

698
00:49:16,162 --> 00:49:18,080
And...

699
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,792
...action, Dirk.

700
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,466
Hello. Are you John?

701
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,801
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

702
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,471
<i>Your agency recommends you very highly.</i>

703
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,391
<i>Well, I'm a really hard worker, and if
you give me a job, I won't disappoint you.</i>

704
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:40,478
<i>- What special skills do you have?
- Well, I just got--</i>

705
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,315
<i>I've been in the Marines for three years.
I just got back from a tour of duty.</i>

706
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,567
<i>- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.</i>

707
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:50,154
<i>And it got really hard being surrounded
by all those guys all day.</i>

708
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,406
<i>How long has it been since you've had a woman?</i>

709
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:55,784
<i>- A long time.
- That's terrible.</i>

710
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,997
<i>But now I'm back,
and I'm ready to pursue my acting career.</i>

711
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:03,417
<i>Well, as you may or may not know,
this is an important film for me.</i>

712
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:06,337
<i>If it's not a hit,
I'm gonna get kicked out of my apartment.</i>

713
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,590
<i>- My landlord's a real jerk.
- Really?</i>

714
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:13,594
<i>Why don't you take your pants off?
It's important I get an idea of your size.</i>

715
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:15,554
<i>No problem.</i>

716
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:22,186
Oh.

717
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,966
I think that you have the job,
but why don't I make sure of something?

718
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:57,471
This is a giant cock.

719
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:39,615
We've rolled out.

720
00:52:39,782 --> 00:52:42,159
Uh, we gotta change mags.

721
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:44,745
Do it quickly.

722
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,128
- Kids.
- Is everything cool?

723
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:56,090
It's going great. We just gotta change the angle.

724
00:52:56,256 --> 00:52:58,092
Does it--? Does it look sexy?

725
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,345
- Oh, it's great.
- You're doing so good, Dirk.

726
00:53:01,512 --> 00:53:03,764
- Does it feel good?
- Yep.

727
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,897
Okay?

728
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:13,440
Roll sound, Scotty.

729
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,862
Speed.

730
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:21,699
Quiet. Sticks.

731
00:53:25,994 --> 00:53:27,621
Marker.

732
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,456
We're back.

733
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,583
Action, kids.

734
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,630
- We're gonna go down now.
- Okay.

735
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:41,927
- No. No, first-- Down again.
- Okay.

736
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,602
John, you're a wonderful actor.

737
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:53,021
Oh, John.

738
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:00,988
- Oh, John.
- Yeah.

739
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,324
John, you're a wonderful actor.

740
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,175
- You're amazing.
- Oh, you feel so good, Amber.

741
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:23,051
- Are you ready to come?
- Yeah.

742
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,345
- Come in me.
- What?

743
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:29,308
Don't worry. I'm fixed. I want you to come in me.

744
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:31,268
- Okay. Yeah.
- Yeah?

745
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,853
Okay.

746
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,196
Oh, God, yeah.

747
00:54:47,451 --> 00:54:49,203
Wonderful.

748
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,457
- Cut. Terrific. Nice work. Nice work.
- All right.

749
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,126
Congratulations. That was great, wasn't it?

750
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:57,836
- Wasn't that sexy?
- Rock 'n' roll.

751
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,546
- That was something.
- Really good.

752
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,048
It looked great. Very sexy.

753
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,342
- Doesn't he fuck like a champ?
- Was it sexy?

754
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,718
- You rocked.
- Thanks.

755
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,554
- Hey, the camera loves you.
- We didn't get the come shot.

756
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,348
- What?
- We missed the come shot.

757
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:11,141
He came inside of her.

758
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,977
Maybe we could, like, go to stock footage or--

759
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,815
Are you crazy? It won't match.

760
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:19,024
- Well--
- Jack.

761
00:55:19,191 --> 00:55:22,986
- Hmm?
- I could do it again if you need a close-up.

762
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,661
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

763
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,288
Okay, everyone say, "Dirk."

764
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:34,790
Dirk.

765
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,584
These are real wood.

766
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,712
No, these. These are the ones. These are great.

767
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,923
Yeah. Those are really cool. Are they lizard?

768
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,093
No. They're Italian. I'm gonna fucking buy these.

769
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:49,972
Guys.

770
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:54,142
It's funny you say that
because we should be in a band, you know?

771
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,611
- Like my shoes?
- They're cool.

772
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,197
I got them with Reed and Scotty.
They're cool, huh?

773
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,658
- Yeah.
- You know, embossed leather...

774
00:56:09,825 --> 00:56:13,287
...with this patchwork, reptilian-pattern design.

775
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,414
- Cool.
- Can we have some hot sauce here?

776
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,332
- Oh, hi, Scotty.
- Hi, Scotty.

777
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:20,252
- Come on, sit down and help yourself.
- Oh, thanks.

778
00:56:20,419 --> 00:56:21,503
Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

779
00:56:21,670 --> 00:56:24,298
- Scotty, this is Jaime Lynn.
- I was thinking about the--

780
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,383
Scotty, Jaime Lynn. Say hello to Jaime Lynn.

781
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,468
- You're a Leo, huh?
- That's right.

782
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:31,138
- Hey, my girlfriend wants to meet you.
- Is that right?

783
00:56:31,305 --> 00:56:33,849
- This is Raymond.
- How do you do? What's your name?

784
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,976
- Becky Barnett.
- Excuse me?

785
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:38,020
Becky Barnett.

786
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,772
- Raymond's a Leo.
- I knew it. I knew it.

787
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,649
- What's your sign?
- I'm a Pisces.

788
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:44,985
What? I can't deal with no Pisces.

789
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:47,112
- That shirt's pretty sexy too.
- Well, yeah.

790
00:56:47,279 --> 00:56:50,032
Well, this is, um, like,
imported Italian nylon...

791
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,285
...and, uh, it's like a special-edition,
limited silk print...

792
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:57,748
...and it was done by this really famous,
um, design artist from Italy.

793
00:56:57,915 --> 00:56:58,957
Pick a card, man.

794
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,376
What's up, baby? I love you. Picture later, baby.

795
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,922
What table's that going to?
Four? Five, Jose. Five.

796
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:09,009
What's happening, my man?
You alive, man. I thought you were dead.

797
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:12,679
- Yo, what's up, people?
- Rise from the deck.

798
00:57:12,846 --> 00:57:14,264
Oh.

799
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,266
- Damn, that's--
- Two of diamonds, right?

800
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,477
- That's my card. That is incredible.
- Right.

801
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:22,689
But doesn't it make you nervous when
you're dealing with all those evil forces?

802
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:24,399
Horses? What?

803
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,985
No. The evil forces.

804
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:30,697
Evil? No, man. It's not evil. It's an illusion.

805
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,533
- It's an illusion.
- Yeah. Yeah, it's confusing.

806
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,410
Thank you.

807
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:37,371
Listen up, kid. Listen up.

808
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:40,624
I'm gonna try and do this all in one shot,
know what I mean?

809
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:43,627
So we start like this,
and then you roll her over, Dirk.

810
00:57:43,794 --> 00:57:45,796
Rollergirl, you roll right over with him.

811
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,507
Try to give me every single position.
Is that possible?

812
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,218
Well, if she--
Rollergirl, if you wrap your leg around--

813
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,053
No, the other one, the left one.

814
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,848
Around and over. Good.
See, we can go right into doggy style.

815
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:58,558
Perfect.

816
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,478
Is the movement on a waterbed gonna be a problem?

817
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:03,981
No, not at all, Kurt.
I mean, I dig it. It's great.

818
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,524
- Okay, can we do this?
- Yeah.

819
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:07,985
All right, everybody, here we go.

820
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,737
- This is gonna be great. Jack.
- Yeah?

821
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,739
Do you want me to use a Spanish accent?

822
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:24,501
"Jack Horner has found something special
in newcomer Dirk Diggler.

823
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:28,588
It's another stellar sexual standout
from Horner and Company.

824
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:32,300
Diggler delivers a performance
worth a thousand hard-ons.

825
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,637
His presence when dressed is powerful
and demanding.

826
00:58:35,804 --> 00:58:37,723
<i>When stripped to the bone...</i>

827
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:40,767
<i>...Diggler's more eruptive than a volcano
on a bad day.</i>

828
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:43,478
<i>Amber Waves' ripe cherry lips
do a wonderful job...</i>

829
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,564
<i>...of handling Diggler's wide load.</i>

830
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:47,941
<i>And Reed Rothchild's stiff biceps...</i>

831
00:58:48,108 --> 00:58:52,946
<i>...do a slapping good job
with Becky Barnett's supple ass.</i>

832
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:55,782
<i>But it's Diggler that
remains the standout in this film.</i>

833
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,285
<i>It's easy to predict that after only two films...</i>

834
00:58:58,452 --> 00:59:01,496
<i>...that Diggler's success
can only grow and grow and grow...</i>

835
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:04,124
<i>...and grow and grow and grow...</i>

836
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:08,628
<i>...and grow and grow and grow."</i>

837
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:16,196
- What else?
- Well, that's it for now.

838
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:19,866
I mean, look at the character
Holmes came up with, for instance.

839
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:23,620
- And look, I just...
- Tell me.

840
01:00:24,162 --> 01:00:27,666
I don't like seeing women treated that way.
This guy he plays, Johnny Wadd--

841
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:32,045
It's always about slapping some girl around
or whatever. It's not right. It's not cool.

842
01:00:32,212 --> 01:00:35,298
It's just not sexy. I mean,
it's not sexy like it should be, Jack.

843
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:38,343
This guy's more of like
a James Bond-type character.

844
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:42,139
You know, he's classy. He's a world-traveled guy.

845
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:46,393
- I like that.
- Reed could play my partner.

846
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:50,897
- I like that a lot.
- We could make it really good, Jack.

847
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:54,609
Honestly, if you direct it,
we make a whole series with a whole story.

848
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,195
I mean, it's exactly
what we've always talked about.

849
01:00:58,280 --> 01:00:59,906
Please?

850
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,368
When we get back, set up the typewriter.

851
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:06,329
We'll see what comes out of it.

852
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,749
But I have to talk to the Colonel
when we get to Vegas.

853
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,919
And, Dirk, you gotta
work on the Colonel too, Dirk.

854
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,546
I mean, you gotta be committed.

855
01:01:14,713 --> 01:01:17,883
Right, right. Jack,
I'll do whatever I have to do.

856
01:01:18,925 --> 01:01:20,510
Does this character have a name?

857
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,432
His name is Brock Landers.

858
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,893
His partner's name is Chest Rockwell.

859
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,439
Those are great names.

860
01:01:33,273 --> 01:01:36,776
<i>And the award for best newcomer goes tom.</i>

861
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,614
Yes. My baby boy. Dirk Diggler. Whoo.

862
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,074
And the award for best cock goes to...

863
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,993
Here we go again. Dirk Diggler.

864
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:48,205
The award for best actor goes to... Aah!

865
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,208
I've seen all his movies,
and I can't wait to work with him.

866
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,710
Mr. Dirk Diggler.

867
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,749
Wow.

868
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,418
- I don't know what to say.
- Come on, say it.

869
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,670
I guess--

870
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:37,963
Wow.

871
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:40,173
I guess the only thing I can say...

872
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:43,510
...is I'll promise to keep rocking 'n' rolling
and making better films.

873
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:49,724
You know, it seems we make
these movies and sometimes, you know...

874
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:52,602
...they're considered filthy or something
by some people...

875
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,896
...but I don't think that's true.

876
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:57,899
These movies we make, they can be better.

877
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:00,986
They can help. They really can. I mean that.

878
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:03,321
We can always do better.

879
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:05,865
I'm gonna keep trying if you guys keep trying.

880
01:03:06,032 --> 01:03:07,742
Let's keep rocking 'n' rolling, man.

881
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,622
Yeah!

882
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:21,172
Yeah!

883
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,177
Marker.

884
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:28,346
Set.

885
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,575
<i>Shot of tequila, straight up.</i>

886
01:03:48,742 --> 01:03:50,577
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

887
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:55,957
<i>I've been in this place for 20 minutes
just to get a seat.</i>

888
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:59,919
<i>- Are you alone?
- Yeah. Just visiting I.A.</i>

889
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:03,131
<i>Some people told me
the food in here was really good.</i>

890
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,258
<i>Good? It's not good.</i>

891
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:09,429
<i>It's probably the best place to eat
in all of Los Angeles. It's excellent.</i>

892
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:11,264
<i>I certainly hope so.</i>

893
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:14,601
<i>I could die of starvation
before I get something in my mouth.</i>

894
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:18,730
<i>Still hungry?</i>

895
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,524
<i>Starving.</i>

896
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:28,031
<i>- Why don't you feast on that?
</i>- Okay.

897
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:40,210
<i>Oh, it's true.</i>

898
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:41,920
<i>What's that?</i>

899
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,131
<i>You are Brock Lenders.</i>

900
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:12,283
<i>Freeze! Don't make me chase you, Raphael!</i>

901
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,547
Freeze!

902
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:43,857
We're almost there. Here's what I want.
I want you to trim the head.

903
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:47,193
Take that shot of Reed with the revolver,
just dump that, okay?

904
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,736
And switch the title card.

905
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:52,240
I want it to come flying right out
of the screen, right at the audience.

906
01:05:52,407 --> 01:05:55,076
- Nice. Piece of cake.
- That's my guy.

907
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,373
I told him,
"This is a special party for Scotty J.

908
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,001
I want your lightest, bubbliest champagne."

909
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,419
So this is what he gave me.

910
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,172
I want you take a little sip
and tell me what you think.

911
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:10,592
This is supposed to be really good stuff.
Here. Take a sip.

912
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,511
- Is that pretty light?
- Yeah, that is.

913
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,805
- Baby, it's beautiful.
- What do you think?

914
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,056
- It's great?
- Yeah.

915
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,726
- Look how spacious it is.
- Yeah. Look, I like this too.

916
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,562
That's custom-made.
That's real imported Italian leather.

917
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:25,106
- This color is very unusual.
- Watch this.

918
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,275
- What's that?
- My initials.

919
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:29,777
Oh, that's so imaginative.
How'd you think of that?

920
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,530
I was just thinking of my name one day
and dreamt it up.

921
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:33,740
- Hi, Dirk.
- How are you?

922
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:35,533
- I'm almost finished.
- Looks great.

923
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:38,244
I used a little poetic license
to capture your essence.

924
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,455
- Show me the rest of the house?
- Looks great.

925
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,499
Yeah, it's good for conversation, huh?

926
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:46,920
Yeah. Jessie did that oil painting as well
and Buck is still installing the stereo.

927
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,713
- That's a beanbag.
- You're kidding.

928
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:52,926
And that lamp, those are real sterling silver.
Yeah, they have a very modern feel too.

929
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,553
This could be the place
you could have conversations.

930
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,263
- You ready?
- What is this? Yeah.

931
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:58,932
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

932
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:03,603
- This is my dojo.
- It's all Asian. You have an Asian room.

933
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:06,940
- Yeah. It has that whole karate feel.
- Nice. It's very comfortable.

934
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,442
- Yeah. A lot of ancient China.
- That's really good.

935
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:11,569
I have my statues for my best-actor awards.

936
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,905
You have a place to keep your awards. I'm glad.

937
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:15,740
Look up there.

938
01:07:15,949 --> 01:07:17,200
Oh, that's handy.

939
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:18,785
- Can you see yourself?
- Yeah.

940
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:20,453
- That's great, huh?
- That's nice.

941
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:21,621
- Ta-da.
- Oh.

942
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,748
- My whole entire wardrobe.
- That's great.

943
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:27,126
It's all perfectly organized by color,
as well as designer.

944
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:31,756
You don't have to think about anything.
You just reach in and know right where it is.

945
01:07:31,923 --> 01:07:33,216
- You're gonna love it.
- Yeah?

946
01:07:33,383 --> 01:07:36,427
This is my favorite thing
in the whole world. Close your eyes.

947
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:38,596
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, baby.

948
01:07:43,935 --> 01:07:46,062
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Oh, God. Heh.

949
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:49,566
This is it. This is the thing.

950
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:51,192
You deserve this, baby.

951
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:55,238
Isn't it great? This is the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen in my whole life.

952
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:57,532
- You wanna go for a ride?
- Oh, yeah. Heh.

953
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:00,577
Let's do this thing. She rocks.

954
01:08:00,743 --> 01:08:02,161
Whoo.

955
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:03,621
- Yeah!
- Ha, ha.

956
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:05,832
- Hold on.
- Ha, ha.

957
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:09,085
<i>- You set us up, Chico.
- You wanna fuck with Raphael and Ringo...</i>

958
01:08:09,252 --> 01:08:12,797
<i>...that's your business.
You don't fuck with Chest and Brock.</i>

959
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:15,216
<i>- No--
- You know what?</i>

960
01:08:15,383 --> 01:08:16,884
<i>- No.
- You're not even worth it.</i>

961
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,220
<i>I gave you a chance.</i>

962
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:24,767
<i>I trusted him.</i>

963
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:30,231
<i>Well, we almost solved the case.</i>

964
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,776
<i>At least the women are safe.</i>

965
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:37,196
<i>Let's go get some of that Saturday-night beaver.</i>

966
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,326
<i>No one fucks with Chest and Brock.</i>

967
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,871
This is the best work we've ever done.

968
01:08:45,038 --> 01:08:47,540
It's a real film, Jack.

969
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,754
- It feels good.
- You made it fly.

970
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:57,925
You know, this is the film...

971
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,511
...I want them to remember me by.

972
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,066
Thank you.

973
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:35,129
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
it's all about love, you know?

974
01:09:35,296 --> 01:09:38,675
I mean, if you love someone,
how hard can the world be?

975
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:42,261
I mean, uh, people will come
and they will go, and so will problems...

976
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:47,684
...but ultimately, if you have got love
on your side, and it is just...

977
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:52,438
I mean, it is just deep down in your soul...

978
01:09:53,272 --> 01:09:57,402
...what's a problem gonna be
that takes your attention away from that?

979
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,738
Do you understand?

980
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:06,160
- I'm Becky Barnett.
- I'm Jerome.

981
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,830
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too, Becky.

982
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:12,750
- So, what do you do?
- Oh, uh, I'm in the auto industry.

983
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:14,001
Oh.

984
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:16,629
Yeah, I'm a regional manager over at Pep Boys.

985
01:10:16,796 --> 01:10:17,922
Oh. Wow.

986
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,590
That's great. That's great.

987
01:10:19,757 --> 01:10:21,467
You've got a really nice smile, Becky.

988
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:24,303
Thank you, heh, heh...

989
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:26,514
- ...Jerome. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

990
01:10:39,485 --> 01:10:42,488
- The Colonel.
- Excuse me.

991
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:47,785
Floyd Gondolli. Ha, ha.
Great you could make it. Great, great, great.

992
01:10:47,952 --> 01:10:51,414
- How are you? You look happy.
- I'm fine.

993
01:10:51,581 --> 01:10:53,750
- Meet boys, Tommy, Pete.
- Hi.

994
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,877
Meet girls, Cyndi, Angie.

995
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,253
- Hi.

996
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,672
- These are the next stars.
- Mm-hm.

997
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,259
- These are the real people in the world.
- Ah, ahem.

998
01:11:03,426 --> 01:11:07,680
I think we ought to talk with Jack now.
Iron this out before we start the new year?

999
01:11:07,847 --> 01:11:08,848
Let's do it.

1000
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:12,685
What were you thinking? What
were you feeling? Did you do research?

1001
01:11:12,852 --> 01:11:14,687
- Hi, Amber.
- What are you talking about?

1002
01:11:14,854 --> 01:11:17,982
- Oh, nothing.
- You wanna come with me for a little while?

1003
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:21,194
- Where?
- It's a surprise, surprise, surprise.

1004
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:23,863
Yeah. Let's go. Excuse me, Jessie.

1005
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:56,437
- Hey, Buck.
- Hey, Jessie. How you doing?

1006
01:11:56,604 --> 01:11:59,565
- You sitting alone?
- Yes.

1007
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:06,072
- Todd Parker.
- Rocking Reed Rothchild.

1008
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:10,576
- Aw, you made it. Yeah. Woo-hoo.
- Yeah.

1009
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:12,995
Amazing party, man. Fucking chicks everywhere.

1010
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,748
You bet. Courtesy of Jack Homer. Thank you.

1011
01:12:15,915 --> 01:12:19,001
I wouldn't mind me having
a piece of that action right over there.

1012
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:20,878
That's Michelle. I'll introduce you.

1013
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:24,799
- Sure. Introduce her to my lap.
- Ha, ha. Did you get off work, man?

1014
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:27,093
- I don't dance Sunday nights.
- Right.

1015
01:12:27,260 --> 01:12:30,304
- Whose Vette is that out in the driveway?
- Dirk.

1016
01:12:30,471 --> 01:12:32,598
- I'm so jealous of him.
- That shit's jamming.

1017
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:35,935
It's dropped down low with a 350 cube,
3-and-a-quarter horsepower...

1018
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:39,105
...4-speed, 4.10 gears,
10 coats of competition orange...

1019
01:12:39,272 --> 01:12:41,941
...hand-rubbed lacquer
with a dual-plane manifold.

1020
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:44,235
Tsk, full fucking race cams. Whoa.

1021
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:45,945
Yep.

1022
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,454
I'm pretty happy with it, you know.

1023
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:57,331
It's a great look for you, I think.

1024
01:12:57,498 --> 01:13:00,501
It's pretty original, you know, I think.

1025
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,211
Right.

1026
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,674
Heh. I'm gonna take this off.

1027
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:10,970
- Ha, ha.
- Yeah.

1028
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,972
What were we talking about before?

1029
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:16,726
- Um, oil painting?
- No.

1030
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:20,813
- No-- Yes. I mean, um, but I was saying--
- Oh, oh, oh. Sunsets.

1031
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,733
Right, yeah. I was saying that I love sunsets.

1032
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:27,153
- But sunrises are better. Heh.
- Exactly. Ha, ha.

1033
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,780
I thought I was the only one who felt that way.

1034
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:31,824
- No, I feel that way.
- Really?

1035
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:35,328
Yes, really. Hey, have you ever heard
my stereo system?

1036
01:13:35,494 --> 01:13:38,706
- No.
- I'm gonna open my own business.

1037
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,001
- Really?
- Yes. Yes. It's my dream.

1038
01:13:42,168 --> 01:13:47,131
Okay, it's hi-fi stereo equipment
at discount prices.

1039
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:50,551
Yeah. It's called Buck's Super Stereo World.

1040
01:13:50,718 --> 01:13:53,220
- That is a fucking great idea. Heh.
- Yeah.

1041
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:57,516
You know, in the 80s,
that's when it's gonna happen for real.

1042
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,353
- Really?
- Yes, really. The 1980s.

1043
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,562
Wow.

1044
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,776
I wanted you to give me a minute
so I could tell you how much I love you.

1045
01:14:06,943 --> 01:14:10,529
I mean, it's gonna be a new year and
we're gonna start things and do things...

1046
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:14,200
...and I just wanted you to know
how much I care about you.

1047
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:15,826
I really care about you, honey.

1048
01:14:15,993 --> 01:14:17,870
- You're my little baby.
- Thank you, Amber.

1049
01:14:18,037 --> 01:14:22,541
You're the best thing that's happened to me
since my son went off, and I just--

1050
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,378
I love you, honey.

1051
01:14:25,544 --> 01:14:27,588
I love you too.

1052
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:31,842
Fucking 1980, you know?

1053
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:33,469
- Can you believe it?
- I can't.

1054
01:14:33,636 --> 01:14:38,432
I mean, it's like, the next thing you know
it's gonna be, like, 1990 and 2000.

1055
01:14:38,599 --> 01:14:40,559
- I mean, can you imagine?
- Hmm.

1056
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:46,565
Goodbye, 1979. Hello, 1980.

1057
01:14:46,732 --> 01:14:48,067
Okay.

1058
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:52,571
Make sure you snort it back real quick and hard.

1059
01:14:52,738 --> 01:14:55,491
- Huh?
- Like this.

1060
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,041
Okay.

1061
01:15:09,088 --> 01:15:12,008
- Ugh, it burns.
- It's good though, right?

1062
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,093
- It's going in my throat.
- Hmm.

1063
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:16,971
That's the drip. The drip's the best part.

1064
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:20,433
- It tastes like aspirin.
- Here. Do one more in the other nostril.

1065
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:23,185
- I need a drink of water, I think.
- Mm-mm.

1066
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:26,564
One more, and then a drink of water.

1067
01:15:32,737 --> 01:15:34,864
Do you think I look cool when I do it?

1068
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:42,288
So let's talk about the future.

1069
01:15:42,455 --> 01:15:45,332
Let's talk about what video means
to this industry.

1070
01:15:45,499 --> 01:15:48,002
And let's talk about how all of us--
Not one of us.

1071
01:15:48,169 --> 01:15:49,879
How all of us are gonna profit.

1072
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:54,550
I've been doing theater in San Francisco
and San Diego...

1073
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:57,053
...about as long as
you've been doing stag and hard-core.

1074
01:15:57,219 --> 01:15:59,555
We're all familiar with your biography, Floyd.

1075
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:02,266
No one is doubting your credentials
or your history.

1076
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,310
Then why the resistance?

1077
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:07,813
I mean, this industry is gonna
be turned upside down soon enough.

1078
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:11,817
- Why help it?
- Why not be prepared?

1079
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,528
Colonel's got the money.
You got the talent, Jack.

1080
01:16:14,695 --> 01:16:17,615
I got the connection to the equipment
and the mail-order distribution.

1081
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:22,870
Not to mention those kids out there
who are hot fuck action to the max, Jack.

1082
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,749
This is the future. Videotape tells the truth.

1083
01:16:26,916 --> 01:16:32,838
Wait a minute. You come into my house,
my party, to tell me about the future?

1084
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:36,592
That the future is tape, videotape, and not film?

1085
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:40,179
That it's amateurs and not professionals?
I'm a filmmaker.

1086
01:16:40,346 --> 01:16:43,516
That's why I will never make a movie
on videotape.

1087
01:16:43,682 --> 01:16:45,351
And I'll tell you something else.

1088
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,479
I will never, ever loan out any of the actors...

1089
01:16:48,646 --> 01:16:51,524
- ...that I have under contract to you.
- Wait, wait, wait, Jack.

1090
01:16:52,024 --> 01:16:55,111
I'm not a complicated man. I like cinema.

1091
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:58,030
In particular,
I like to see people fucking on film.

1092
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:01,200
I don't wanna win an Oscar,
and I don't wanna reinvent the wheel.

1093
01:17:01,367 --> 01:17:05,371
I like simple pleasures like butter in my ass,
lollipops in my mouth.

1094
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,873
That's just me.
That's just something that I enjoy.

1095
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:09,708
Call me crazy, call me a pervert...

1096
01:17:09,875 --> 01:17:12,962
...but there's one little thing
that I wanna do in this life...

1097
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:17,800
...and that is I wanna make
a dollar and a cent in this business.

1098
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,427
Ahh, Jack, I'm not trying to hurt you.

1099
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:23,556
I'm trying to help you
stay one step ahead of the game.

1100
01:17:24,014 --> 01:17:27,393
We're going in circles now.
We're in familiar territory.

1101
01:17:27,852 --> 01:17:29,979
The territory we're in is the future.

1102
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,355
Not to mention the cost.

1103
01:17:32,356 --> 01:17:35,568
You know, if it looks like shit
and it sounds like shit...

1104
01:17:35,734 --> 01:17:37,278
...then it must be shit.

1105
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:42,074
You're holding on too tight, Jack.
It doesn't have to look good.

1106
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:44,535
Film is just too damn expensive.

1107
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:47,705
And the theaters are already converting
to video projectors.

1108
01:17:48,414 --> 01:17:49,915
I haven't heard that.

1109
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,917
Well, it's true.

1110
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:56,422
Well...

1111
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,384
Ten minutes before the new year.

1112
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:04,471
I'd like to spend it with my friends.

1113
01:18:05,097 --> 01:18:08,309
We will or will not continue this conversation.

1114
01:18:15,274 --> 01:18:17,776
- Hey, Dirk. Ha, ha.
- Hey, Scotty. What's up?

1115
01:18:17,943 --> 01:18:19,778
- Fucking New Year's, right?
- 1980.

1116
01:18:19,945 --> 01:18:23,616
- Oh, man, right. Did you see my new car?
- You got a new car?

1117
01:18:23,782 --> 01:18:24,992
- Yeah. Wanna see?
- Yeah.

1118
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,244
All right, cool. It's out front.

1119
01:18:28,120 --> 01:18:29,246
Come on. It's out front.

1120
01:18:29,413 --> 01:18:32,499
Dirk. I want you to meet my friend Todd.
Todd Parker, Dirk Diggler.

1121
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,585
- What's up? How are you?
- We finally meet.

1122
01:18:34,752 --> 01:18:35,794
- Yeah.

1123
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:38,839
I was telling you about him before.
You remember. Todd Parker.

1124
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,926
- He works at Party Boys Strip Club.
- Oh, cool. You're a dancer.

1125
01:18:42,092 --> 01:18:44,929
- Yeah, I got some moves.
- Dirk? Uh--

1126
01:18:45,596 --> 01:18:48,224
I'm sorry. You coming?
Or you wanna talk to these guys--?

1127
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,976
Yeah, Scotty. I'll be around in a bit.
We can talk then?

1128
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,436
- Okay.
- See you later, Reed.

1129
01:18:52,603 --> 01:18:54,271
- See you.
- All right.

1130
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,653
Uh, when you get by, uh, the lights,
close your eyes.

1131
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:01,820
- Okay?
- All right.

1132
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,365
- All right, just follow my voice. All right'?
- Yeah.

1133
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,492
Here, here, here.

1134
01:19:06,659 --> 01:19:08,869
Here, here, here.

1135
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,330
- Here, here, here.
- Where?

1136
01:19:11,497 --> 01:19:14,458
Keep coming. All right, open them.

1137
01:19:14,625 --> 01:19:16,460
This is it. Ha-ha-ha.

1138
01:19:16,627 --> 01:19:19,296
- It's cool.
- Yeah. You wanna get inside?

1139
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:21,048
- When did you get this?
- Uh, yesterday.

1140
01:19:21,215 --> 01:19:25,010
Actually, I had it painted yesterday
so the paint might still be kind of sticky.

1141
01:19:25,177 --> 01:19:28,514
- This is great, man. Really great.
- You wanna go for a ride?

1142
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:32,142
Wait, wait, wait. Fuck.
Hell, how much time is left?

1143
01:19:32,851 --> 01:19:35,437
- I'm sorry, Dirk.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

1144
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,524
- Why did you do that, Scotty?
- Uh, you look at me sometimes.

1145
01:19:38,691 --> 01:19:40,526
- What?
- I wanted to know if you like me.

1146
01:19:40,693 --> 01:19:43,654
Well, of cour-- Uh. Yeah, I like you, Scotty.

1147
01:19:43,821 --> 01:19:45,864
- Can I kiss you? Please?
- Scotty, I don't--

1148
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,700
- Can I kiss you on the mouth?
- No.

1149
01:19:47,866 --> 01:19:50,119
- Please let me.
- Scotty.

1150
01:19:50,286 --> 01:19:53,539
I'm really sorry. I didn't mean
to grab you like that or scare you.

1151
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,499
- It's all right.
- Do you wanna kiss me?

1152
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,751
- Scotty, what?--?
- No?

1153
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,837
- What is the matter with you?
- Uh, forget it.

1154
01:20:00,004 --> 01:20:04,717
I'm really drunk. Really, I am. I'm just--
I'm out of my head.

1155
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:07,386
I'm so wa-- I'm really wasted. Really, Dirk.

1156
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,347
- I'm really wasted. I'm crazy right now.
- I understand, man.

1157
01:20:10,514 --> 01:20:13,058
- I'm really crazy, you know?
- Do you wanna go back inside?

1158
01:20:13,225 --> 01:20:14,601
Uh--

1159
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:17,187
- Do you like my car, Dirk?
- What?

1160
01:20:17,354 --> 01:20:19,023
- I mean--
- Yeah. Yeah.

1161
01:20:19,189 --> 01:20:21,066
Because I wanted to, you know--

1162
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,444
I wanted to make sure you thought it was cool...

1163
01:20:23,610 --> 01:20:26,113
...or else I was gonna take it back.

1164
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:27,823
Oh.

1165
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,575
- Yeah.
- It's great, Scotty.

1166
01:20:29,742 --> 01:20:31,368
Happy New Year.

1167
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:34,330
- Happy New Year, Scotty.
- I love you. I really love you.

1168
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:36,290
- I love you too, Scotty.
- Okay.

1169
01:20:36,457 --> 01:20:40,711
- All right, let's go back inside, okay?
- All right. All right.

1170
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:51,013
Fucking idiot.

1171
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:54,058
I'm a fucking idiot.

1172
01:20:56,143 --> 01:20:58,854
I'm a fucking idiot.

1173
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,441
I'm a fucking idiot.

1174
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:06,945
I'm a fucking idiot.

1175
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:09,615
I'm a fucking idiot.

1176
01:21:09,782 --> 01:21:14,203
Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot. Fucking idiot.

1177
01:21:14,912 --> 01:21:20,959
Jackie. Jackie.
Two minutes, pops. Let's go, let's go.

1178
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:23,921
Whoo!

1179
01:21:24,922 --> 01:21:28,384
Two. Two minutes. Two minutes.

1180
01:21:28,759 --> 01:21:30,302
Come on, Little Bill.

1181
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:33,931
Okay. Becky, I'm--

1182
01:21:38,644 --> 01:21:41,814
Little Bill. Smile, man. Come here.

1183
01:21:42,439 --> 01:21:44,149
Right, ha, ha.

1184
01:21:47,403 --> 01:21:49,154
I'm so excited.

1185
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,701
Little Bill, champagne?

1186
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:57,287
- Aw, thanks. That's really nice of you.
- Happy New Year.

1187
01:21:57,454 --> 01:21:58,622
- To you too.
- Okay, man.

1188
01:21:58,789 --> 01:22:00,624
Get some champagne, dude.

1189
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,170
No, I'm sorry, I don't have any matches.

1190
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,714
- I got it here, hold on.
- Happy New Year.

1191
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:14,847
Hey, Kurt, have you seen my wife?

1192
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,224
No, no. Hey, they're doing that countdown thing.

1193
01:22:17,391 --> 01:22:19,476
- Come on in, man.
- Okay.

1194
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:02,478
Come on, say something. Make a toast.

1195
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:04,771
Hey, Little Bill, look at me.

1196
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:11,880
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1197
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:15,300
...four, three, two--

1198
01:24:18,512 --> 01:24:22,140
- What the fuck was that?
- Where's Jack?

1199
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,312
Where's Jack?

1200
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,696
<i>What about your character Brock Lenders...</i>

1201
01:24:35,862 --> 01:24:39,783
<i>...and what some people might consider
violent attitudes towards women?</i>

1202
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:44,454
<i>Violence? No. What--?</i>

1203
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:50,711
<i>I mean, if there's a certain amount
of, you know, violence or action...</i>

1204
01:24:50,877 --> 01:24:53,422
<i>...in this series of films,
you know, that's the movie.</i>

1205
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:59,386
<i>If Brock Landers is slick with a gun...</i>

1206
01:24:59,553 --> 01:25:02,431
<i>...he does so only in the vein of good and right.</i>

1207
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:05,392
<i>Brock protects the values
of the American ideal...</i>

1208
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:10,981
<i>...and fights for causes that instill pride in
a society where morals are hard to come by.</i>

1209
01:25:11,148 --> 01:25:13,859
<i>- Who sent you? Who sent you?
- Get the fuck off me, asshole.</i>

1210
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,862
<i>Lie still! Lie still
or I'll punch you in the goddamn face!</i>

1211
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:19,197
<i>Fuck off.</i>

1212
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:21,700
<i>I'll find out who sent you.</i>

1213
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:31,209
<i>Amber, I live in this world.
I don't like violence any more than you do.</i>

1214
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:33,670
<i>Violence is a bad thing.</i>

1215
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:38,425
<i>But when you see violence in films, it's--
You know--</i>

1216
01:25:38,592 --> 01:25:42,554
<i>If movies, films, caused violence...</i>

1217
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:44,723
<i>...we'd be able to wipe out violence tomorrow.</i>

1218
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,725
<i>Boom, no more films. That's fine with me.</i>

1219
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:49,519
<i>I'll find something else to do.
I'll fuck on my own time.</i>

1220
01:25:49,686 --> 01:25:52,230
<i>You know, I got other interests. I'm a magician.</i>

1221
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:56,693
<i>Urn, and, you know, hopefully, that'll be
something that I focus on in the future.</i>

1222
01:25:56,860 --> 01:26:00,906
<i>Because you can't fuck forever.
I realize that. Anyway, violence...</i>

1223
01:26:01,073 --> 01:26:04,534
...is <i>something that plagues us as a society.</i>

1224
01:26:05,118 --> 01:26:08,580
<i>Well, the fine line is I'm playing a character.</i>

1225
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:10,999
<i>You know, I mean, I'm Dirk Diggler.</i>

1226
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,420
<i>Brock Lenders is a character that I'm playing.</i>

1227
01:26:16,088 --> 01:26:18,674
<i>I'm gonna ask you once more,
and I'm gonna ask you nice.</i>

1228
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,801
<i>Where the fuck is Ringo, you bitch?</i>

1229
01:26:21,218 --> 01:26:22,719
<i>Fuck you.</i>

1230
01:26:22,886 --> 01:26:23,929
Oh!

1231
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:26,181
<i>- Uh, why do I love him? AMBER". Yeah.</i>

1232
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,684
<i>He's, uh-- He's very special.</i>

1233
01:26:28,850 --> 01:26:32,479
<i>And, um, he can fuck hard
or he can fuck, like, really gently.</i>

1234
01:26:32,646 --> 01:26:34,398
<i>He's the best.</i>

1235
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:39,695
<i>Uh, I think that's part of my reason
for doing this, you know?</i>

1236
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:42,531
<i>I've gotten thousands
upon thousands of letters.</i> ..

1237
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:44,408
<i>...you know, from people telling me:</i>

1238
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:48,620
<i>"God, you've taught me this and
you've made our love life so much better."</i>

1239
01:26:48,787 --> 01:26:51,623
<i>And this isn't "Go out and have sex
with 10 million people."</i>

1240
01:26:51,790 --> 01:26:55,460
<i>And, you know, "How to get a girl off."
It's about how to get your wife off.</i>

1241
01:26:55,627 --> 01:26:57,963
<i>If only people
could have been doing this before...</i>

1242
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:00,507
<i>...we could have saved a million relationships.</i>

1243
01:27:00,674 --> 01:27:02,259
<i>You know, I've saved thousands.</i>

1244
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:05,262
<i>Blocking, an idea or a movement.</i>

1245
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:09,975
<i>Jack will put the final touches together
for what the camera needs for editing...</i>

1246
01:27:10,142 --> 01:27:13,186
<i>...but, you know, he allows me
to block my own sex scenes...</i>

1247
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:17,232
<i>...and, you know, gives me the freedom
to develop the character and stuff like that.</i>

1248
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,901
<i>God, ha, ha, I don't know any other,
you know, director...</i>

1249
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:24,698
<i>...who would let an actor,
you know, do that, heh. You know?</i>

1250
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:29,703
<i>Ha-ha-ha. I don't allow him
to block his own sex scenes.</i>

1251
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:32,330
<i>It is. It's jealousy.</i>

1252
01:27:32,497 --> 01:27:37,043
<i>It's deceitfulness. It's vindictiveness.
It's all of that stuff, you know?</i>

1253
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:40,297
<i>But, I mean, God, what can you expect
when you're on top, you know?</i>

1254
01:27:40,464 --> 01:27:43,175
<i>It's like Napoleon. When he was the king...</i>

1255
01:27:43,341 --> 01:27:46,094
<i>...you know, people were constantly
trying to conquer him...</i>

1256
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,346
<i>...you know, in the Roman Empire.</i>

1257
01:27:49,347 --> 01:27:51,850
<i>So it's history repeating itself all over again.</i>

1258
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:55,353
<i>To all the critics out there,
I know they're gonna be reviewing this...</i>

1259
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,522
...and <i>I know they're gonna try to knock me.</i>

1260
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:01,193
<i>I just want them to know-- Is it okay
if I say this into the camera, Amber?</i>

1261
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,028
<i>Okay-</i>

1262
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:06,156
<i>I only am who I am because I was born that way.</i>

1263
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:11,036
<i>I have a gift, and I am trying
to not be selfish about it, but to use it.</i>

1264
01:28:11,203 --> 01:28:15,373
<i>Okay? And if you wanna knock me for that,
it's your own problem, okay?</i>

1265
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:17,918
<i>Jealousy will get you nowhere.</i>

1266
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:20,420
<i>I'm gonna keep rocking on.</i>

1267
01:28:21,880 --> 01:28:23,381
<i>For Dirk Diggler. .</i>.

1268
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:27,385
<i>...the future is something
to look forward to, not to fear.</i>

1269
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:29,930
<i>He is a creative man of many interests:</i>

1270
01:28:30,096 --> 01:28:34,184
<i>Film, poetry, karate, music, and dance.</i>

1271
01:28:34,351 --> 01:28:37,229
<i>He is a man of passion and mystery.</i>

1272
01:28:37,395 --> 01:28:39,648
<i>He is a man of lust.</i>

1273
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,410
- It's my poem to you.
- It's good, Amber. It's really good.

1274
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:55,580
You're like a director now.
So have you shown Jack yet?

1275
01:28:55,747 --> 01:28:58,250
No, just you. I wanted you to be the first.

1276
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,752
- It's really good, Amber. Congratulations.
- Thanks.

1277
01:29:00,919 --> 01:29:02,838
- Thanks, baby.
- Wow.

1278
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,924
Um, the only thing I was wondering is--

1279
01:29:06,091 --> 01:29:08,760
You might think about cutting that part
where Jack talks--

1280
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:10,387
- About blocking the sex?
- Yeah.

1281
01:29:11,596 --> 01:29:14,099
That stuff about me
not being a black belt is not true.

1282
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,518
Yeah. I can fix that.

1283
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,562
- Ace of spades.
- How did it turn out?

1284
01:29:20,063 --> 01:29:21,898
- Are you sure?
- No.

1285
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,775
- Shit.
- Hello?

1286
01:29:23,942 --> 01:29:26,945
- Hey, how was it, man?
- What?

1287
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,030
Really? I bet. You're so good.

1288
01:29:29,197 --> 01:29:32,534
- Look, slow-- Slow down. Slow down.
- You'll have to show it to me.

1289
01:29:32,701 --> 01:29:38,456
Guys, guys, guys. Slow down, Colonel. Say again?

1290
01:29:42,460 --> 01:29:44,337
I'll be right there.

1291
01:29:53,305 --> 01:29:54,639
80...?

1292
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,601
Well, let me tell you, Jack, ha, ha.

1293
01:29:58,727 --> 01:30:05,317
I mean, I don't mean to laugh about it,
but she was 15 going on 150, believe me.

1294
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:08,153
She was-- You would never know it. Never know.

1295
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:11,907
I mean, I was fooled completely.
I mean, I've had a few of them.

1296
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,116
Anyhow...

1297
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,995
You do believe me, don't you, Jack?

1298
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,663
Yeah, I believe you.

1299
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:23,001
Anyway, so I take her home, Jack,
you know, and I got her there...

1300
01:30:23,168 --> 01:30:25,170
...and I tell her not to do so much coke...

1301
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:28,673
...but she must have done 20 lines
of this stuff in, like, 5 minutes.

1302
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,176
It's like a vacuum in her nose.
And there's only--

1303
01:30:32,510 --> 01:30:33,553
Just going up like crazy.

1304
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:37,724
Anyway, she's got all this stuff going up,
and the next thing you know, she started--

1305
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:41,102
Something must have broken up there,
blood poured all over the place.

1306
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:44,606
All over the sheets and everything.
Just... pouring out.

1307
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:47,651
- Oh, Jack. Oh, God.
- All right.

1308
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,862
You thought she was older.
You-- You didn't do anything.

1309
01:30:51,029 --> 01:30:55,075
She was just at the-- She was at your place.
You didn't do anything, right?

1310
01:30:55,241 --> 01:30:56,785
- Nothing.
- You didn't do anything?

1311
01:30:56,952 --> 01:30:59,704
- You know me. I didn't do a thing.
- You didn't do anything?

1312
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:02,999
- No, I didn't do anything.
- All right, nothing.

1313
01:31:06,962 --> 01:31:08,797
But they, uh...

1314
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:12,258
They found something at the house.

1315
01:31:14,427 --> 01:31:17,138
- What?
- There's something that's...

1316
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:23,478
Jack, it's my fucking weakness, Jack.

1317
01:31:23,645 --> 01:31:27,148
It's just, they're so small,
and they're so cute and they're so adorable.

1318
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:30,068
- I just can't help it when they're so cute--
- Jesus Christ.

1319
01:31:30,235 --> 01:31:32,779
No, no, Jack. Listen, listen.
I don't touch them, Jack.

1320
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:37,409
I don't touch them in any way, honestly.
Jack, please.

1321
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:39,202
All right.

1322
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:44,749
Tsk. Well, now you think I'm an asshole.

1323
01:31:46,167 --> 01:31:51,089
Jack, let me tell you this.
I love you, Jack. I'm your friend.

1324
01:31:51,256 --> 01:31:54,175
There's one thing I want you to do, though.
Tell me--

1325
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,470
Jack, come on. Tell me that you're my friend.

1326
01:31:57,887 --> 01:32:00,390
Just tell me. Am I your friend? Am I--?

1327
01:32:05,729 --> 01:32:06,771
<i>Jack?</i>

1328
01:32:08,606 --> 01:32:10,150
<i>Jack?</i>

1329
01:32:11,109 --> 01:32:14,070
<i>Jack, Jack, am I your friend?</i>

1330
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:19,159
<i>Just tell me. Am I?
Just tell me, Jack. Am I your friend?</i>

1331
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,667
- I do.
- I do too.

1332
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,050
<i>I now pronounce you man and wife.</i>

1333
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,309
Listen, I'm-- I'm dying--

1334
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,479
- I'm dying to do a movie with you.
- I know you are.

1335
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:49,939
I mean, it's such an important thing in my life.

1336
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,150
I spoke to Jack--

1337
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:56,321
Oh, man. I just--

1338
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:58,698
<i>- I'll</i> tell you what comes to mind.
- Yeah?

1339
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:02,118
What comes to mind is
I am the ultimate Latin lover.

1340
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:05,789
- I've never been to Las Vegas.
- There is no Latin lover like me, understand?

1341
01:33:05,955 --> 01:33:07,791
Once you get Maurice as the Latin lover...

1342
01:33:07,957 --> 01:33:09,834
Have you ever been to, um, Niagara Falls?

1343
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:12,670
- I've been to Las Vegas.
- That is great. That's so great.

1344
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:16,007
This is gonna be a great opportunity for me
to run the store my way.

1345
01:33:16,174 --> 01:33:18,343
- Just to get those guys off my back.
- Exactly.

1346
01:33:18,510 --> 01:33:21,179
- Hello? Champagne.
<i>- I'll</i> run the store my way.

1347
01:33:21,346 --> 01:33:24,432
- You--? Are you guys moving to Bakersfield?
- Did you find a house?

1348
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:25,683
- Yeah.
- Soon?

1349
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,977
- I know-- I once lived in Bakersfield.
- Yeah?

1350
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:31,147
Hey, guys, we're losing these two.
They're moving to Bakersfield.

1351
01:33:31,314 --> 01:33:34,150
- Did you like it there?
- Big promotion.

1352
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,861
They look at the movies and say,
"Hell, I can do that."

1353
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,572
- I can do it.
- It's more complicated than that.

1354
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,616
- It's a tough racket, actually.
- Right.

1355
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:43,993
Hey, Dirk, you made it.

1356
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:46,371
- Hey, Jack.
- How you doing?

1357
01:33:46,538 --> 01:33:48,957
Good. Who's that?

1358
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,376
Hi. I'm Johnny Doe.

1359
01:33:51,543 --> 01:33:53,920
You're Dirk Diggler.

1360
01:33:55,880 --> 01:33:58,174
It's great to meet you.

1361
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:02,929
Johnny's, uh, the new boy on the street.

1362
01:34:03,096 --> 01:34:06,057
He's interested in, uh, show business.

1363
01:34:12,063 --> 01:34:13,773
He's very tired.

1364
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:17,986
And, uh, he's shy, you know?

1365
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:22,949
So like I said, it's a tough--
It's a tough business.

1366
01:34:23,116 --> 01:34:24,617
You got a great kisser...

1367
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:30,415
...but, you know, there's a lot of work
involved, a lot of people.

1368
01:34:30,582 --> 01:34:33,042
We all have to work our buns off.
Know what I mean?

1369
01:34:33,209 --> 01:34:38,423
I mean, it takes 15, 16 guys
just to do the lighting.

1370
01:34:40,008 --> 01:34:42,552
No, no, no. It's crystal, man.
You just wanna do bumps.

1371
01:34:42,719 --> 01:34:46,472
- Shut up, man.
- All right.

1372
01:34:46,931 --> 01:34:48,683
Hey, you guys.

1373
01:34:49,142 --> 01:34:50,643
What?

1374
01:34:50,810 --> 01:34:53,730
- Just saying hey.
- Yeah, whatever.

1375
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,441
Oh, man.

1376
01:34:57,442 --> 01:34:59,319
- Oh!
- You all right?

1377
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:03,323
- It's fucking getting me fucking high, man.
- Yeah. It's that carpet dope.

1378
01:35:04,741 --> 01:35:07,035
It's the kind of dope they used to put carpet in.

1379
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:10,788
You know, they'd mix it up in the bathtub
and while they were mixing it up...

1380
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:13,958
...they'd drop in a hunk of carpet into it.

1381
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,628
Ow!

1382
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:20,506
It's a lot better than that pink shit,
I tell you. The pink shit's fucking weird.

1383
01:35:20,673 --> 01:35:22,759
They put fish scales in that shit.

1384
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:35,813
Fuck.

1385
01:35:44,530 --> 01:35:47,659
You look good. You ready?

1386
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:49,661
You ready?

1387
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:58,836
Come on.

1388
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:04,509
I am a star.
I'm a fucking rock 'n' roll star, man.

1389
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,844
My cock can get hard. Come on. Fuck.

1390
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,473
Please don't do this to me. No, please. Come on.

1391
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:13,518
I'm a star. I am--

1392
01:36:19,023 --> 01:36:21,567
Again. You ready?

1393
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:24,988
I'm born ready.

1394
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:27,198
Come on.

1395
01:36:29,701 --> 01:36:31,744
- What?
- It's just there's a thing there--

1396
01:36:31,911 --> 01:36:33,371
- No.
- That'll Work.

1397
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:34,956
- Jack.
- Yeah?

1398
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:36,874
I'm ready to shoot.

1399
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,920
- Uh, 20 minutes, huh?
- No. I'm ready now. It's gotta be now.

1400
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:42,255
Twenty minutes, babe.

1401
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:46,259
Fuck it. Hey, no. Hey, Jack.
I'm ready to shoot now.

1402
01:36:46,426 --> 01:36:49,012
My cock is ready. I wanna fuck. Let's go.

1403
01:36:49,178 --> 01:36:50,638
Twenty minutes.

1404
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,391
- I wanna fuck. Who's it gonna be?
- What?

1405
01:36:53,558 --> 01:36:55,852
Who do you want to start fucking? Me or him?

1406
01:36:56,019 --> 01:36:57,061
- What?
- Shut up, okay?

1407
01:36:57,228 --> 01:37:00,148
- I didn't do anything to you.
- What? You're not even an actor.

1408
01:37:00,315 --> 01:37:02,942
- You got no business being here.
- Knock this shit off.

1409
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,235
- Yes, I am.
- No, no.

1410
01:37:04,402 --> 01:37:07,071
- I'm an actor. I'm a real fucking actor.
- Shut up.

1411
01:37:07,238 --> 01:37:08,406
- What?
- Hey, come on.

1412
01:37:08,573 --> 01:37:09,824
- Shut up.
- No.

1413
01:37:09,991 --> 01:37:12,702
Stop this Mickey Mouse bullshit.
I want you to go in there.

1414
01:37:12,869 --> 01:37:16,080
I want you to cool off, okay?

1415
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:18,958
Just cool off and we'll come back
and shoot the scene.

1416
01:37:19,125 --> 01:37:21,502
- I said, I'm ready to shoot.
- Not now.

1417
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:24,130
I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack.

1418
01:37:24,380 --> 01:37:26,674
I'm not gonna shoot you in the state you're in.

1419
01:37:26,841 --> 01:37:29,344
What do you mean, "state"?
State? State of California?

1420
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:32,597
- I know where the fuck I am, Jack.
- You've been up for two days.

1421
01:37:32,764 --> 01:37:34,432
No, I haven't been up for two days.

1422
01:37:34,599 --> 01:37:37,101
Nevertheless,
you look like you haven't been to sleep.

1423
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,605
So I ain't gonna shoot you this way
because you don't look good.

1424
01:37:40,772 --> 01:37:42,982
You know what? You don't tell me anything, okay?

1425
01:37:43,149 --> 01:37:44,984
- Really?
- You're not the boss of me.

1426
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:46,611
- Yes, I am.
- Oh, you're the king, huh?

1427
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:48,571
- Yes!
- Don't you fucking touch me, man!

1428
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:51,366
- Dirk, honey--
- No, no. No. You shut up too.

1429
01:37:51,532 --> 01:37:53,993
You're not the mother of me
and you're not my boss.

1430
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:55,953
- You're not my fucking mom.
- Hey, man--

1431
01:37:56,120 --> 01:37:57,705
- Dirk, honey--
- I'll take you home.

1432
01:37:57,872 --> 01:38:01,876
No, no. I'm ready to shoot the scene.
I wanna shoot the scene. I'm fine.

1433
01:38:02,043 --> 01:38:03,544
I want you out of here.

1434
01:38:03,711 --> 01:38:07,590
- Look, it's over, okay? I'm done.
- Listen to me, kid. I want you--

1435
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,592
- Don't you fucking call me a kid.
- What?

1436
01:38:09,759 --> 01:38:13,388
I'll fuck you up. You wanna see me
kick some ass? I know fucking karate.

1437
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:16,224
- You're fucking fired! You are fired!
- Come on, come on.

1438
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:19,018
- You're fired, you goddamn kid!
- What is that? What is that?

1439
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:21,020
- Jack! Jack!
- Jack, Jack, Jack.

1440
01:38:21,187 --> 01:38:23,940
No, no, no. You know what?
I'm the biggest star here, man.

1441
01:38:24,107 --> 01:38:26,109
That's the way it is.

1442
01:38:26,275 --> 01:38:30,738
I wanna fuck. It's my big dick.
So everybody get ready fucking now!

1443
01:38:32,615 --> 01:38:35,326
You know what? Here. I don't need this shit.

1444
01:38:35,493 --> 01:38:38,037
You know, fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck all of you!

1445
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,331
You're not my boss! You're not the king of me!

1446
01:38:40,498 --> 01:38:42,375
I am the fucking king of Dirk!

1447
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:45,628
You're nothing without me, Jack.
You're fucking nothing. Fuck this.

1448
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:47,505
- I don't need this shit.
- Dirk, wait.

1449
01:38:47,672 --> 01:38:49,757
- Fuck this.
- I'm so sorry, Jack. I'm so sorry.

1450
01:38:49,924 --> 01:38:52,593
I'm gonna take care of this.
I'm gonna straighten him out.

1451
01:39:07,733 --> 01:39:09,318
Okay, Dirk, you ready?

1452
01:39:09,485 --> 01:39:11,487
Yeah. I was born ready, Nick. Let's go, man.

1453
01:39:12,321 --> 01:39:14,157
- Dirk Diggler demo.
- Keep the vocals up.

1454
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:17,034
"You Got the Touch," take seven.

1455
01:39:17,869 --> 01:39:19,370
Excuse me, Reed.

1456
01:39:19,537 --> 01:39:22,039
Oh, heh. Oops.

1457
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,795
You got the <i>touch</i>

1458
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:32,675
<i>You got the power</i>

1459
01:39:35,636 --> 01:39:36,929
<i>Yeah</i>

1460
01:39:43,478 --> 01:39:46,898
<i>After all is said and done</i>

1461
01:39:47,064 --> 01:39:50,109
<i>You never walk, you never run</i>

1462
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:52,320
<i>You're a winner</i>

1463
01:39:54,572 --> 01:39:58,284
<i>You got the moves, you know the streets</i>

1464
01:39:58,451 --> 01:40:01,370
<i>Break the rules, take the heat</i>

1465
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,248
<i>You're nobody's fool</i>

1466
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,295
<i>You're at your best When the goin' gets rough</i>

1467
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:13,925
<i>You've been put to the test But it's never enough</i>

1468
01:40:14,509 --> 01:40:16,260
<i>You got the touch</i>

1469
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:20,097
You think the bass is taking away from the vocal?

1470
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:26,437
No, not really. Maybe. It sounds balanced to me.

1471
01:40:26,604 --> 01:40:28,606
It's definitely taking away from my vocal.

1472
01:40:28,773 --> 01:40:31,442
Just take the bass down and bring up the vocals.

1473
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:34,237
Okay, let's do it, Nick. You heard him.

1474
01:40:34,946 --> 01:40:36,447
You wanna take it from the top?

1475
01:40:36,614 --> 01:40:39,116
- Yeah, let's try it.
- Okay.

1476
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:44,413
<i>Heat will rock you</i>

1477
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:49,710
<i>And heat will roll you</i>

1478
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:55,132
<i>Baby, don't you know?</i>

1479
01:40:55,633 --> 01:41:00,513
<i>My heat will move your soul</i>

1480
01:41:01,180 --> 01:41:02,682
<i>BOTH". Come on, come on, come on</i>

1481
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,183
<i>Come on</i>

1482
01:41:04,684 --> 01:41:08,729
<i>Love me today</i>

1483
01:41:09,981 --> 01:41:14,318
<i>Love me tomorrow</i>

1484
01:41:15,319 --> 01:41:18,239
<i>All day, all night</i>

1485
01:41:18,406 --> 01:41:21,492
<i>You feel my heat</i>

1486
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,414
<i>BOTH". Feel, feel, feel, feel my heat</i>

1487
01:41:26,581 --> 01:41:28,291
I think we should repeat that again.

1488
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:32,837
<i>BOTH". Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel</i>

1489
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:34,213
<i>Feel my heat</i>

1490
01:41:34,380 --> 01:41:35,715
<i>Feel my heat</i>

1491
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:38,676
Yeah. That's definitely cool.

1492
01:41:39,135 --> 01:41:41,804
- Let's lay it down. Nick?
- You wanna lay it down?

1493
01:41:41,971 --> 01:41:43,556
Were we rolling on that rehearsal?

1494
01:41:43,723 --> 01:41:46,517
Is he gonna fuck me in the ass?

1495
01:41:46,684 --> 01:41:49,687
- Is that what you want?
- It would be nice.

1496
01:41:50,021 --> 01:41:52,064
Fuck her in the ass.

1497
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:54,400
Lock and load, Jack.

1498
01:42:02,116 --> 01:42:04,577
I was gonna take a pottery class
at Everywoman's Village.

1499
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:07,038
- Oh, I wanna do that.
- Okay, we'll do that.

1500
01:42:07,204 --> 01:42:09,165
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 3.

1501
01:42:09,332 --> 01:42:11,792
- I was thinking something.
- What?

1502
01:42:12,335 --> 01:42:14,920
I was gonna see about taking the GED.
Do you know what that is?

1503
01:42:15,087 --> 01:42:18,591
- Mm-hm, for high school, to graduate.
- It's because I never got my diploma.

1504
01:42:18,758 --> 01:42:22,011
I feel bad, you know, that, uh--
I think you were right about that.

1505
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:25,139
You should do it, Rollergirl,
because you know what?

1506
01:42:25,306 --> 01:42:28,017
If you wanted to, you could do anything.

1507
01:42:33,939 --> 01:42:36,067
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes. That's me. yes.

1508
01:42:36,233 --> 01:42:38,527
- You have your loan application?
- Yes, I do. Right there.

1509
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:40,780
- Good. You wanna follow me?
- Yes, I do.

1510
01:42:41,238 --> 01:42:44,408
Hey, Kurt, are we gonna
have any more coverage on this, or...?

1511
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:46,827
No, no. We just keep shooting. This is video.

1512
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,497
We shoot and shoot,
and then we deal with it later.

1513
01:42:49,664 --> 01:42:52,416
All right, now, Summer,
I want you to take Skye's thong off.

1514
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:55,961
That thong thing. Yeah, actually take it off.
That's good. And finger it.

1515
01:42:56,128 --> 01:42:57,922
Oh, that's good. Lick the thong. Yeah.

1516
01:42:58,089 --> 01:43:00,508
You know, that's really good technically, but--

1517
01:43:00,675 --> 01:43:03,511
But it lacks passion.
I wanna see some passion here.

1518
01:43:03,678 --> 01:43:05,096
<i>Yes, bitch!</i>

1519
01:43:06,722 --> 01:43:08,599
<i>Yeah, that's it.</i>

1520
01:43:09,183 --> 01:43:10,476
<i>Lick my balls.</i>

1521
01:43:11,227 --> 01:43:12,311
<i>Fuck me.</i>

1522
01:43:14,355 --> 01:43:15,690
<i>Who's your daddy, bitch?</i>

1523
01:43:16,732 --> 01:43:20,403
<i>You live. You live. Yes!</i>

1524
01:43:22,697 --> 01:43:24,407
I'm back.

1525
01:43:24,824 --> 01:43:25,866
Perfect timing.

1526
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:28,661
I'm back.

1527
01:43:30,788 --> 01:43:32,915
- What the fuck took you so long, man?
- Todd.

1528
01:43:43,467 --> 01:43:44,510
Fuck.

1529
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:48,556
That's really what Buck's Super Stereo
World is all about. It's about the customer.

1530
01:43:48,723 --> 01:43:51,308
People wanna know
what they're getting into technically.

1531
01:43:51,475 --> 01:43:53,811
I have the specific technical hi-fi background...

1532
01:43:53,978 --> 01:43:56,188
...to answer any question somebody's gonna have.

1533
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:58,691
I've been in sound equipment
long enough to know...

1534
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:01,318
...what a guy wants
when he walks through that door.

1535
01:44:01,485 --> 01:44:05,030
That's the kind of personal touch
Buck's Super Stereo World's gonna have.

1536
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:14,832
I miss my two sons, you know.
I miss my little Andrew and-- And my Dirk.

1537
01:44:14,999 --> 01:44:18,627
You know, I always felt like Dirk was my baby.

1538
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:20,087
My new baby.

1539
01:44:20,504 --> 01:44:23,799
- Don't you miss Dirk?
- Yeah.

1540
01:44:23,966 --> 01:44:27,595
He's so fucking talented, the bastard.
You know, I just--

1541
01:44:29,638 --> 01:44:34,226
I love him, Rollergirl.
I mean, I really love the stupid jerk, ha, ha.

1542
01:44:35,936 --> 01:44:37,980
I love you, Mom.

1543
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:41,066
I want you to be my mom, Amber. Are you my mom?

1544
01:44:41,525 --> 01:44:44,653
I'll just-- I'll ask you if you're my morn, okay?

1545
01:44:44,820 --> 01:44:47,698
And you say yes, okay? Are you my mom?

1546
01:44:48,324 --> 01:44:49,575
Yes, honey.

1547
01:44:49,742 --> 01:44:53,078
- Ha.
- Yes. Yes.

1548
01:44:54,663 --> 01:44:57,374
- Don't try--
- Hold on. Come on, come on, all right?

1549
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,752
All we need is the tapes, Burt.

1550
01:44:59,919 --> 01:45:02,296
No. You don't get them until you pay.

1551
01:45:02,463 --> 01:45:04,965
In our situation,
that doesn't make any fucking sense!

1552
01:45:05,132 --> 01:45:07,510
Wait. We can't pay the price of the demo tapes...

1553
01:45:07,676 --> 01:45:11,138
...unless we take the demo tapes
to the record company and get paid!

1554
01:45:11,305 --> 01:45:13,349
Hello? Exactly.

1555
01:45:13,724 --> 01:45:17,561
That's not an MP. That's a YP. "Your problem."

1556
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,564
Come up with the money
and I'll give you the tapes. That's it.

1557
01:45:20,731 --> 01:45:24,193
Okay, now you're talking above my head.
I don't know this industry jargon.

1558
01:45:24,360 --> 01:45:25,736
YP, MP. Whatever, okay?

1559
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,489
All I know is that
I cannot get a record contract--

1560
01:45:28,656 --> 01:45:31,867
We cannot get a record contract
unless I take these tapes--

1561
01:45:32,034 --> 01:45:34,036
And granted, the tapes themselves are your--

1562
01:45:34,203 --> 01:45:37,081
Are your busi-- Are your-- You own them, okay?

1563
01:45:37,248 --> 01:45:40,918
But the magic that is on the tapes,
that fucking heart and soul...

1564
01:45:41,085 --> 01:45:44,380
...that we put into those tapes,
that is ours, and you don't own that.

1565
01:45:44,547 --> 01:45:47,925
Now, I need to take that magic
and get it to the record company.

1566
01:45:48,092 --> 01:45:50,970
They're waiting. We were supposed
to be there a half-hour ago.

1567
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:54,265
We look like assholes right now, man.

1568
01:46:00,729 --> 01:46:04,567
I don't wanna do this anymore, honey.
I can't. I just-- Let's have fun now.

1569
01:46:04,733 --> 01:46:08,320
Let's just go and go and go, because it's over.

1570
01:46:08,487 --> 01:46:12,283
There's too many things. Too many things.
Too many things. Too many things.

1571
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:15,119
- Okay.
- Let's go walk.

1572
01:46:15,286 --> 01:46:18,414
- I don't wanna leave this room.
- Me either, ha, ha.

1573
01:46:19,248 --> 01:46:20,666
I love you, honey.

1574
01:46:20,833 --> 01:46:22,626
- I love you, Mom.
- Aah!

1575
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,964
Let me explain to him in simple arithmetic.
One, two, three.

1576
01:46:27,131 --> 01:46:31,135
Because you don't fucking get it, Burt.
You give us the tapes.

1577
01:46:31,302 --> 01:46:34,763
We get the record contract. We come back
and give you your fucking money.

1578
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:37,016
Have you heard the tapes? Have you heard them?

1579
01:46:37,182 --> 01:46:39,727
We're guaranteed a record deal.
Our stuff is that good!

1580
01:46:39,894 --> 01:46:42,855
Okay, now I got it. I got it. Now I understand.

1581
01:46:43,022 --> 01:46:46,483
I know you want it to happen,
but it's not gonna happen...

1582
01:46:46,650 --> 01:46:49,737
...because it's a Catch-22, and that's it.

1583
01:46:49,904 --> 01:46:52,448
What the fuck does that mean?
What is a Catch-22, Burt?

1584
01:46:52,615 --> 01:46:55,451
- Aah.
- Twenty-two, gentlemen. Think about it.

1585
01:46:57,119 --> 01:46:59,204
- You know what I'm thinking about, man?
- No, Dirk!

1586
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:01,957
I'm thinking about
kicking some fucking ass in here!

1587
01:47:02,124 --> 01:47:03,542
Scotty, get him out of here.

1588
01:47:03,709 --> 01:47:07,338
Thanks a lot for backing us up too. Real good.

1589
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:09,715
Fuck.

1590
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:16,597
- Mr. Swope.
- Yes.

1591
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,475
We can't help you.

1592
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:26,148
I have all the papers, though.
I mean, every-- Everything's in order, yes?

1593
01:47:26,315 --> 01:47:30,402
Yes, yes, but we can't give you a loan.
I'm sorry.

1594
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:31,987
- Why?
- I don't understand. Why?

1595
01:47:32,154 --> 01:47:33,864
Yeah, why can't you give me the loan?

1596
01:47:35,991 --> 01:47:37,868
Mr. Swope, you're a pornographer.

1597
01:47:38,035 --> 01:47:40,496
This bank is not in business
to support pornography.

1598
01:47:40,663 --> 01:47:43,415
Okay, I'm not a pornographer, though.
I'm an actor.

1599
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:45,250
- I'm sorry.
- Please, please.

1600
01:47:45,417 --> 01:47:48,837
Now, this is a new business for me.

1601
01:47:49,004 --> 01:47:55,010
All right? It's a real thing that I wanna do.
It's a real thing that I can do. Please.

1602
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,471
- I'm sorry.
- Well, we did everything right.

1603
01:47:57,638 --> 01:47:59,974
Okay, honey, it's okay.
Just wait a minute, wait a minute.

1604
01:48:00,140 --> 01:48:03,018
Now, let's just take a minute, okay? Um...

1605
01:48:03,727 --> 01:48:06,855
Look, you have something to say.
I have something to say, all right?

1606
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:09,233
So let's just talk, okay?

1607
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:12,569
If there is something
that I didn't fill out correctly on this...

1608
01:48:12,736 --> 01:48:16,490
...or if there is something I left out,
or maybe you want me to write on there...

1609
01:48:16,657 --> 01:48:19,618
...just tell me what to write on there.
I'll write it on there.

1610
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:21,704
I'm sorry.

1611
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:27,459
You're not being fair. This isn't fair.

1612
01:48:27,626 --> 01:48:30,879
This financial institution
cannot endorse pornography.

1613
01:48:31,046 --> 01:48:33,465
Stop saying that!
<i>Wlll</i> you quit saying "pornography"?

1614
01:48:33,632 --> 01:48:37,720
- Why are you doing this to me?
- Please. Now, please. I'm sorry.

1615
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:43,892
I'm an-- I am an ac-- I am an actor.

1616
01:48:48,147 --> 01:48:49,440
Come on.

1617
01:49:15,966 --> 01:49:18,802
- That guy wants that thing for the thing--
- You fix it up.

1618
01:49:32,649 --> 01:49:34,485
Who's your <i>daddy?</i>

1619
01:49:34,651 --> 01:49:37,529
- How is it?
- What it is, what it is.

1620
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:39,323
<i>Yeah.</i>

1621
01:49:41,366 --> 01:49:43,869
<i>Suck that cock, bitch.</i>

1622
01:49:57,925 --> 01:50:00,469
- Hello. You must be Maggie.
- Yes.

1623
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:03,889
- Kathleen O'Malley. I'm the judge.
- Yes.

1624
01:50:06,183 --> 01:50:09,019
- You have a lawyer with you?
- No, I don't.

1625
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:11,021
I do not.

1626
01:50:27,871 --> 01:50:30,874
- Hello, judge.
- Morning, counselor.

1627
01:50:51,812 --> 01:50:53,522
You've been divorced for six years?

1628
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:56,316
Yes, since 1977.

1629
01:50:56,483 --> 01:51:00,028
And the agreement on the money settlement
has been taken care of?

1630
01:51:00,946 --> 01:51:02,573
Yes.

1631
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:07,870
So, what we're talking about then is coming
to an agreement on the custody of...

1632
01:51:08,036 --> 01:51:09,997
- Of "Andrew."
- Yes.

1633
01:51:11,748 --> 01:51:14,251
Oh, what was decided during the divorce?

1634
01:51:14,418 --> 01:51:17,963
Well, initially, uh,
Andrew was to go with his father...

1635
01:51:18,130 --> 01:51:20,465
...with a visitation with his mother...

1636
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:25,637
...uh, from, uh, Saturday noon to Sunday at 7...

1637
01:51:25,804 --> 01:51:31,268
...with his mother entitled to bring Andrew
to her house or any reasonable place.

1638
01:51:31,435 --> 01:51:34,229
- Was that the understanding?
- Yes.

1639
01:51:34,730 --> 01:51:37,149
Why wasn't that visiting privilege honored, then?

1640
01:51:37,316 --> 01:51:40,736
- It was for a while.
- I only saw him twice.

1641
01:51:40,903 --> 01:51:43,906
It said "reasonable place."

1642
01:51:44,072 --> 01:51:48,452
I didn't think that a house of prostitution
and drugs and pornography was that.

1643
01:51:48,619 --> 01:51:50,162
I'm sorry?

1644
01:51:50,329 --> 01:51:53,665
My wife is in the pornography business.

1645
01:51:54,458 --> 01:51:56,752
I didn't think that environment
was safe for my son.

1646
01:51:56,919 --> 01:52:01,465
No, this is not right.
Um, my son was never exposed to drugs...

1647
01:52:01,632 --> 01:52:03,842
...or pornographic material
or any of those things.

1648
01:52:04,009 --> 01:52:05,761
My husband just assumed--

1649
01:52:05,928 --> 01:52:09,264
I saw it with my own eye, Maggie.

1650
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,892
Did you register a complaint?

1651
01:52:12,059 --> 01:52:15,187
Uh, my client
didn't officially register, Your Honor.

1652
01:52:15,354 --> 01:52:20,484
But I think the circumstances call
for immediate action, uh...

1653
01:52:20,651 --> 01:52:22,152
...for the safety of the child.

1654
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:26,323
The problem is, judge,
is that my ex-wife, ahem...

1655
01:52:26,490 --> 01:52:31,662
...she's a sick person, and she needs help.
She deals in sex and drugs for a living.

1656
01:52:31,828 --> 01:52:33,789
No, I don't do drugs.

1657
01:52:33,956 --> 01:52:37,292
Your Honor, she has been
in and out of trouble with the law...

1658
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:39,294
...on several occasions for this sort of thing.

1659
01:52:39,461 --> 01:52:42,798
No, no. No, not anymore. No.

1660
01:52:42,965 --> 01:52:45,259
Have you ever been arrested?

1661
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:48,345
Yes.

1662
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:54,184
When was the last time you were arrested,
and, uh, what was the charge?

1663
01:53:11,910 --> 01:53:15,664
<i>Okay, okay, okay,
let's get ready for this experiment.</i>

1664
01:53:16,206 --> 01:53:18,542
<i>Hi. Jack Homer here.</i>

1665
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:22,879
<i>Uh, we're in the back of this beautiful
limousine in the back seat...</i>

1666
01:53:23,046 --> 01:53:26,633
<i>...riding along west on Sherman Way.</i>

1667
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:32,723
<i>And beside me is a beautiful, talented,
gorgeous, young actress...</i>

1668
01:53:32,889 --> 01:53:36,143
<i>...from adult cinema, Miss Rollergirl.</i>

1669
01:53:36,310 --> 01:53:38,603
<i>Hi. Hello. Howdy.</i>

1670
01:53:38,770 --> 01:53:41,606
<i>Are you ready to get on with this experiment?</i>

1671
01:53:41,773 --> 01:53:44,443
<i>- Ready. Ready like Freddy.
- Ha-ha-ha.</i>

1672
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:49,489
<i>Yes. And we're, uh, going along,
like I said, west on Sherman Way...</i>

1673
01:53:49,656 --> 01:53:53,243
<i>...and this is called On the Lookout.</i>

1674
01:53:53,410 --> 01:53:57,247
<i>That's the name of this show.
On the lookout for a young stud...</i>

1675
01:53:57,414 --> 01:54:00,667
<i>...who maybe will get in the back seat here...</i>

1676
01:54:00,834 --> 01:54:04,171
<i>...and get it on with Rollergirl.</i>

1677
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:09,259
<i>Uh, and we're going to make film history...</i>

1678
01:54:09,426 --> 01:54:11,928
<i>...right here on videotape.</i>

1679
01:54:25,734 --> 01:54:28,653
- Hello?
- Hey.

1680
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:31,323
Waiting for someone?

1681
01:54:32,616 --> 01:54:34,159
Yeah.

1682
01:54:34,326 --> 01:54:38,497
I'm waiting for somebody, but I'm not sure
if they're gonna show up, though.

1683
01:54:39,373 --> 01:54:41,416
You wanna wait in the car?

1684
01:54:43,418 --> 01:54:44,878
Cool.

1685
01:55:12,989 --> 01:55:14,741
I'm Joe.

1686
01:55:15,492 --> 01:55:17,327
Dirk.

1687
01:55:19,996 --> 01:55:21,998
You know who I am?

1688
01:55:24,042 --> 01:55:25,669
No.

1689
01:55:27,087 --> 01:55:29,339
My name's Dirk Diggler.

1690
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:32,509
No.

1691
01:55:33,009 --> 01:55:36,138
I mean, you're a guy. I'm just helping you out.

1692
01:55:36,721 --> 01:55:38,181
Yeah.

1693
01:55:39,349 --> 01:55:40,600
<i>What do you see here?</i>

1694
01:55:41,977 --> 01:55:43,854
<i>Well, I see a girl. Ha, ha.</i>

1695
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:46,606
<i>Ha, yeah. Well, you like what you see?</i>

1696
01:55:46,773 --> 01:55:51,528
<i>- Um, yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Ha, ha, all right. Get in.</i>

1697
01:55:51,695 --> 01:55:56,032
<i>Get in and let's make film history.</i>

1698
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,537
So...

1699
01:56:01,329 --> 01:56:03,123
...what do you wanna do?

1700
01:56:04,124 --> 01:56:06,293
It's what you wanna do.

1701
01:56:08,295 --> 01:56:10,213
I wanna watch you.

1702
01:56:11,381 --> 01:56:14,176
I mean, I'm not gay. I just wanna...

1703
01:56:15,343 --> 01:56:18,472
Maybe you could jerk off a little,
and I could watch.

1704
01:56:19,681 --> 01:56:23,226
Maybe I'll join in later,
but for now, I just wanna watch.

1705
01:56:25,395 --> 01:56:27,189
Twenty bucks.

1706
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,443
Ten's all I have.

1707
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:37,282
<i>You go to school?</i>

1708
01:56:37,449 --> 01:56:40,076
<i>Urn, yeah. Yeah, I do.</i>

1709
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,120
<i>Where do you go to school?</i>

1710
01:56:42,287 --> 01:56:43,955
<i>Um...</i>

1711
01:56:44,372 --> 01:56:46,333
<i>Is it okay if I don't tell you?</i>

1712
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:48,668
<i>Yeah. Yeah, that's cool.</i>

1713
01:56:48,835 --> 01:56:50,253
Ahem.

1714
01:56:50,420 --> 01:56:52,589
<i>You recognize Rollergirl from her films?</i>

1715
01:56:52,756 --> 01:56:57,302
<i>Yep. Ha, ha, yeah. Yeah,
we watch her films a lot at my frat house.</i>

1716
01:56:57,469 --> 01:57:00,555
<i>- I go to, uh-- I go to CSUN. JACK". Wonderful.</i>

1717
01:57:00,722 --> 01:57:03,433
<i>Yeah, the fucking guys
will never believe this, ha, ha.</i>

1718
01:57:04,559 --> 01:57:09,231
<i>So, you know, we've done a whole
bunch of films together, Rollergirl and I.</i>

1719
01:57:09,606 --> 01:57:11,107
<i>Do you remember me?</i>

1720
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:12,776
Ahem.

1721
01:57:12,943 --> 01:57:15,195
<i>We went to school together.</i>

1722
01:57:16,905 --> 01:57:18,990
<i>Your name's Brandy, right?</i>

1723
01:57:20,116 --> 01:57:22,953
<i>Brandy? Brandy's your name, right?</i>

1724
01:57:24,579 --> 01:57:26,206
<i>No.</i>

1725
01:57:26,456 --> 01:57:29,501
<i>- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Your name's not Brandy?</i>

1726
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:36,049
<i>Well,</i> ha-- Okay.

1727
01:57:39,553 --> 01:57:42,472
Maybe--? Maybe do it harder?

1728
01:57:51,731 --> 01:57:54,901
Faster. Do it a little faster.

1729
01:57:58,280 --> 01:58:00,240
<i>All right.</i>

1730
01:58:03,577 --> 01:58:07,831
<i>You're hiding her again.
Let's get on the other side. That's it.</i>

1731
01:58:09,499 --> 01:58:13,044
<i>Just nice and sexy, you know...</i>

1732
01:58:13,211 --> 01:58:14,879
Yeah.

1733
01:58:19,884 --> 01:58:23,847
<i>Listen, pal, you gotta make it
a little more sexy, you know?</i>

1734
01:58:24,014 --> 01:58:26,600
<i>Don't just ram it in there like that.</i>

1735
01:58:26,766 --> 01:58:29,811
<i>This is not a hole in the wall, pal.
This is Rollergirl.</i>

1736
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,855
Faster.

1737
01:58:35,233 --> 01:58:37,110
Do it faster.

1738
01:58:38,028 --> 01:58:41,197
- Get your hand wet.
- Be quiet.

1739
01:58:43,366 --> 01:58:47,203
<i>JACK". Can you be more sexy?
Like, uh, cinematically sexy.</i>

1740
01:58:47,370 --> 01:58:49,247
<i>Just don't ram it. Don't--</i>

1741
01:58:50,749 --> 01:58:53,877
<i>Be respectful. This is Rollergirl.</i>

1742
01:58:54,753 --> 01:58:56,087
<i>Are you listening to me, kid?</i>

1743
01:58:56,254 --> 01:58:59,257
<i>- Just let me do my thing. I know what--
- This is stupid, Jack.</i>

1744
01:58:59,424 --> 01:59:03,595
<i>Okay, that's it. Hold it. Cut. Pull over.</i>

1745
01:59:04,054 --> 01:59:05,180
<i>Pull over.</i>

1746
01:59:13,438 --> 01:59:16,775
I can't fucking believe this.
Jesus Christ, you gave me a hard-on, lady.

1747
01:59:16,941 --> 01:59:19,569
The least you could do
is jack me off or something.

1748
01:59:20,195 --> 01:59:21,946
What the fuck did you say?

1749
01:59:23,365 --> 01:59:26,618
I just said it's not that cool
to leave me with a hard-on, all right?

1750
01:59:26,785 --> 01:59:28,787
Fuck you.

1751
01:59:30,914 --> 01:59:33,291
I don't fucking believe this.

1752
01:59:35,543 --> 01:59:37,629
This is a fine life you've made for yourself.

1753
01:59:39,547 --> 01:59:41,716
You really should be proud.

1754
01:59:41,925 --> 01:59:43,802
I mean, really.

1755
01:59:45,595 --> 01:59:48,598
- Fucker.
- Yeah, fuck you.

1756
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:51,685
And your fucking films suck now anyway.

1757
01:59:57,524 --> 01:59:59,275
Come on.

1758
02:00:01,361 --> 02:00:05,115
I can't. I can't get it hard, all right?
I just can't. I'm sorry.

1759
02:00:09,869 --> 02:00:13,415
You just shouldn't do this sort of thing, faggot.

1760
02:00:13,581 --> 02:00:14,958
Get out of the car, man!

1761
02:00:15,125 --> 02:00:17,919
Jack, Jesus. No, Jack. Jack.

1762
02:00:18,086 --> 02:00:20,755
Jack. Jack. Hey.

1763
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:22,215
Jack. Jack.

1764
02:00:22,382 --> 02:00:24,843
Get him out of the fucking truck, man!

1765
02:00:25,009 --> 02:00:26,636
You shouldn't be coming down here.

1766
02:00:26,803 --> 02:00:30,348
Jack. Jack. Jesus Christ.

1767
02:00:30,515 --> 02:00:33,893
- Come on, Jack. Jack.
- You little fucker.

1768
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:36,688
- You piece of shit. You faggot.
- Fuck you.

1769
02:00:36,855 --> 02:00:38,481
Faggot, you like that?

1770
02:00:38,648 --> 02:00:41,151
- Jack. Jack.
- Amateur fucker.

1771
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,945
Come on.

1772
02:00:51,995 --> 02:00:54,330
You don't ever disrespect me.

1773
02:00:54,497 --> 02:00:58,251
Fucker! You don't ever disrespect me, you fucker!

1774
02:00:58,418 --> 02:01:02,005
- Motherfucker, look at you now, huh?
- That's what you get, faggot.

1775
02:01:02,172 --> 02:01:05,133
You think you can fuck?
You can't fuck me, you fucker!

1776
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:09,345
You can't touch me!
You can't touch me, you fucker!

1777
02:01:09,512 --> 02:01:10,889
Stop it.

1778
02:01:12,891 --> 02:01:17,854
- You don't do this, donkey-dick. You don't.
- Unh!

1779
02:01:18,271 --> 02:01:20,064
Fucking faggot.

1780
02:01:24,527 --> 02:01:29,032
- You don't ever disrespect me, you fucker!
- Come on.

1781
02:01:29,199 --> 02:01:31,534
You fucking piece of shit!

1782
02:01:31,701 --> 02:01:37,207
You fucking-- Fucking die, you shithead!

1783
02:02:14,202 --> 02:02:15,787
- Okay.
- Okay.

1784
02:02:15,954 --> 02:02:20,458
- What do you want?
- I want an apple fritter, jelly...

1785
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:25,255
...um, chocolate with sprinkles,
and, um, a bear claw too.

1786
02:02:25,421 --> 02:02:28,591
- A bear claw. Okay.
- Yeah. And hurry.

1787
02:02:28,758 --> 02:02:31,678
Hey, how's my little kung-fu fighter'?

1788
02:02:31,845 --> 02:02:33,972
He's kicking ass inside my stomach.

1789
02:02:34,138 --> 02:02:36,307
- Ha, ha. See? That's a boy.
- Uh-huh.

1790
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:37,851
Okay.

1791
02:02:39,811 --> 02:02:42,564
- Okay, be right back.
- Okay.

1792
02:02:44,607 --> 02:02:47,360
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up? Can I help you?

1793
02:02:47,527 --> 02:02:50,196
- Yeah. Uh, I'm gonna get a dozen.
- All right.

1794
02:02:55,034 --> 02:02:58,288
Let me get, uh, a couple bear claws.

1795
02:02:59,205 --> 02:03:01,833
- Two bear claws.
- Yeah.

1796
02:03:03,126 --> 02:03:05,128
A couple glazed.

1797
02:03:07,297 --> 02:03:10,800
Oh, apple fritter. No, no. Not that one.
The one in front of it.

1798
02:03:10,967 --> 02:03:15,054
- Yeah, that one. That one. That one.
- Okay.

1799
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:20,393
Oh, yeah. Two chocolate.

1800
02:03:21,227 --> 02:03:22,270
Two chocolates.

1801
02:03:22,437 --> 02:03:24,522
Old-fashioned, yeah. Give me two of those.

1802
02:03:24,689 --> 02:03:26,816
Two old-fashioned.

1803
02:03:27,525 --> 02:03:31,279
Oh, is this, uh--?
Did you do this for the Christmas?

1804
02:03:31,446 --> 02:03:33,448
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's cute.

1805
02:03:33,615 --> 02:03:38,161
Yeah, give me two of those
sprinkly Christmas things.

1806
02:03:38,328 --> 02:03:39,829
- Yeah.
- Christmas hoops.

1807
02:03:39,996 --> 02:03:41,664
That's great.

1808
02:03:43,666 --> 02:03:47,253
- Okay, uh, how many is that?
- That's 11.

1809
02:03:51,549 --> 02:03:55,094
All right, motherfucker,
empty the cash register now. And hurry up.

1810
02:03:55,261 --> 02:03:58,306
- Jesus Christ.
- Shut the fuck up.

1811
02:03:58,473 --> 02:04:00,224
Hurry up with that shit.

1812
02:04:04,687 --> 02:04:07,857
No, no, no, motherfucker.
Empty the safe too, asshole.

1813
02:04:11,194 --> 02:04:12,695
And I ain't got all night.

1814
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:18,826
- Don't even move.
- I'm not moving. I'm not moving.

1815
02:04:18,993 --> 02:04:20,870
Shut up!

1816
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:27,752
- Don't fucking move, man.
- I'm not-- I'm not--

1817
02:04:27,919 --> 02:04:29,879
Shut the fuck up.

1818
02:04:30,046 --> 02:04:31,881
Hey, don't-- Don't do that. No, no, no.

1819
02:04:32,048 --> 02:04:35,426
No, no, no. You shut the fuck up.

1820
02:04:36,219 --> 02:04:37,553
Give me this sh--

1821
02:05:28,104 --> 02:05:29,856
All right, this could be the thing.

1822
02:05:30,023 --> 02:05:32,275
Something to help us score a little extra cash.

1823
02:05:32,775 --> 02:05:36,446
The guy's name is Rahad Jackson.
He's got more money than God.

1824
02:05:36,612 --> 02:05:39,532
He's got twice as much coke, crank,
and smack. All right?

1825
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:43,161
This guy's gonna buy just about anything
anybody wants to sell him.

1826
02:05:43,327 --> 02:05:47,081
Just likes people hanging around
at his house partying, the whole thing.

1827
02:05:47,248 --> 02:05:48,624
How do you know him?

1828
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,461
He used to come to Party Boys a lot.
Mutrix introduced me.

1829
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:54,088
How will we do it exactly?
How would it all go down?

1830
02:05:54,255 --> 02:05:57,175
It's gonna go down like this.
I'm gonna call him on the phone...

1831
02:05:57,341 --> 02:06:00,678
...and I'm gonna tell him
I got a half a key of quality stuff.

1832
02:06:00,845 --> 02:06:02,805
Do you have his phone number?

1833
02:06:02,972 --> 02:06:04,390
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1834
02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:07,769
So I'm gonna call him on the phone.
I'm gonna give him a price.

1835
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:08,978
How much?

1836
02:06:09,145 --> 02:06:11,481
Well, it's half a key, man.
It's, like, 5000 bucks.

1837
02:06:11,647 --> 02:06:14,901
- You split that up three ways...
- It's enough to get the Vette fixed.

1838
02:06:15,068 --> 02:06:18,112
That's right, man. So we're gonna do the deal.

1839
02:06:18,279 --> 02:06:20,823
We're gonna drop
half a key of baking soda into a bag.

1840
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:22,992
We're gonna walk over there. We're gonna--

1841
02:06:24,494 --> 02:06:26,788
Boom. Right there.

1842
02:06:26,954 --> 02:06:31,042
- This could be a nifty bit of hustle-bustle.
- Wait. Do you have his address?

1843
02:06:31,209 --> 02:06:33,377
Fucking, Reed, yeah. I got his fucking address.

1844
02:06:33,544 --> 02:06:36,214
What? Yeah, okay, question. Sorry.

1845
02:06:36,380 --> 02:06:39,509
Hold on. What if he tests the stuff out?

1846
02:06:40,093 --> 02:06:42,345
- He won't.
- Well, how do you know that?

1847
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:46,432
Because I know he won't. I'm positive.

1848
02:06:46,599 --> 02:06:48,851
You guys should be careful.

1849
02:06:49,018 --> 02:06:51,187
- Scotty.
- What?

1850
02:06:51,354 --> 02:06:52,522
What do you mean, "What?"

1851
02:06:52,688 --> 02:06:56,567
Do me a favor. Just mind your business,
please. What the fuck?

1852
02:06:56,734 --> 02:06:58,236
Sorry.

1853
02:06:58,402 --> 02:07:00,196
Anyway, heh...

1854
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:02,865
Dump it in there good. Dump it in clean.

1855
02:07:04,408 --> 02:07:06,536
Hey, hey, hey, you can't lay this all on me, man.

1856
02:07:06,702 --> 02:07:08,871
We're gonna go in there-- This is it.

1857
02:07:09,038 --> 02:07:10,498
Fine.

1858
02:07:12,542 --> 02:07:14,335
You guys ready for this?

1859
02:07:14,502 --> 02:07:16,212
- I am.
- Dirk?

1860
02:07:16,379 --> 02:07:20,716
- Me? Yeah, yeah. I was born ready, man.
- All right.

1861
02:07:22,093 --> 02:07:23,719
- What the fuck is that?
- It's a big gun.

1862
02:07:23,886 --> 02:07:26,180
- No shit, but why?
- Just in case.

1863
02:07:26,347 --> 02:07:28,558
Shit.

1864
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:29,934
Fucking great.

1865
02:07:30,101 --> 02:07:31,978
- You never said anything about a gun.
- Shh.

1866
02:07:32,145 --> 02:07:33,563
Now I'm nervous. Do you have a gun?

1867
02:07:33,729 --> 02:07:35,898
- No, I don't have a gun. He never said--
- Shh. Relax.

1868
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:40,319
- Let's just get in and out, all right? In, out.
- Not too fast. It makes it look suspicious.

1869
02:07:41,737 --> 02:07:43,322
Goddamn it.

1870
02:07:43,489 --> 02:07:45,408
You all right'?

1871
02:07:45,575 --> 02:07:48,786
- Just let me do all the talking, all right?
- Just be cool.

1872
02:07:59,547 --> 02:08:02,300
How you doing? Come on in.

1873
02:08:05,678 --> 02:08:07,638
Whoa.

1874
02:08:09,724 --> 02:08:11,934
- Hey, man.
- Hello, come on in.

1875
02:08:12,852 --> 02:08:14,270
Hey.

1876
02:08:25,448 --> 02:08:27,617
Hey, Rahad.

1877
02:08:27,783 --> 02:08:28,993
Hello, friends.

1878
02:08:29,619 --> 02:08:31,120
- Hey.
- Which one is Todd?

1879
02:08:31,287 --> 02:08:35,124
Yeah, that's me. Ha, ha.
We met before, down at Party Boys.

1880
02:08:35,291 --> 02:08:37,793
Yeah, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on in. Come on in.

1881
02:08:37,960 --> 02:08:39,962
Uh, these are my friends here. Dirk and Reed.

1882
02:08:40,129 --> 02:08:42,798
Good to see you.
Take a seat. You want something to drink?

1883
02:08:44,175 --> 02:08:45,843
- Want a pill? Coke? Little dope?
- No.

1884
02:08:46,010 --> 02:08:48,930
- Uh, you sure you don't want something?
- No, thank you. No.

1885
02:08:49,513 --> 02:08:52,308
So got something? Huh?

1886
02:08:52,475 --> 02:08:54,018
We got something here?

1887
02:08:54,644 --> 02:08:56,854
Here it is. That's about half a key right there.

1888
02:08:58,314 --> 02:09:00,358
- All right.
- That is some quality shit.

1889
02:09:01,734 --> 02:09:03,861
- If you wanna test that out...
- Don't worry about him.

1890
02:09:04,028 --> 02:09:06,322
- ...I mean, go ahead. If you want.
- No, no, no. Wait.

1891
02:09:07,949 --> 02:09:09,700
Here's that build-up. I love this part.

1892
02:09:19,710 --> 02:09:21,003
Fucking love that song.

1893
02:09:22,672 --> 02:09:24,674
So anyway, uh, what's the price?

1894
02:09:29,845 --> 02:09:32,515
Well, ha-ha-ha, we, ha-ha-ha...

1895
02:09:35,851 --> 02:09:39,438
Well, ha-ha-ha, we, ha-ha-ha...

1896
02:09:39,605 --> 02:09:43,401
Maybe, I don't know, 5 grand.

1897
02:09:45,611 --> 02:09:48,155
- Five grand.
- Yeah.

1898
02:09:50,533 --> 02:09:52,785
All right. No problem. That's cool.

1899
02:09:58,124 --> 02:09:59,583
Five grand?

1900
02:09:59,750 --> 02:10:01,585
Five grand.

1901
02:10:05,673 --> 02:10:07,341
Okay.

1902
02:10:21,731 --> 02:10:23,357
You guys wanna play baseball?

1903
02:10:23,941 --> 02:10:25,985
- No, thank you.
- No.

1904
02:10:27,737 --> 02:10:31,365
The black guy has a gun in his jacket. Todd?

1905
02:10:40,082 --> 02:10:42,168
Let's get up and get the fuck out of here.

1906
02:10:42,335 --> 02:10:44,086
Todd, count the fucking money in the car.

1907
02:11:00,561 --> 02:11:04,648
Hey, you wanna see something really fascinating?

1908
02:11:08,861 --> 02:11:11,280
- Check it out.
- Oh, wow. That's sweet.

1909
02:11:13,783 --> 02:11:15,659
- That thing's not loaded, is it?
- Not yet.

1910
02:11:15,826 --> 02:11:18,329
- Is that silver? Look-- See, we--

1911
02:11:18,496 --> 02:11:20,790
- Let's see what happens now, huh?
- Don't point--

1912
02:11:20,956 --> 02:11:24,251
- Could you not point the gun, please, sir?
- Ha-ha-ha.

1913
02:11:24,418 --> 02:11:25,461
- Todd.
- You wanna watch.

1914
02:11:26,962 --> 02:11:29,256
- Why? You think I can't do it?
- No, wait, wait.

1915
02:11:29,423 --> 02:11:31,967
- Huh? Ha-ha-ha. You think I can't do it?
- Sir?

1916
02:11:32,134 --> 02:11:34,970
- You wanna see me do it? You dare me?
- No, we don't dare you.

1917
02:11:36,305 --> 02:11:37,473
Fucking dare me.

1918
02:11:43,479 --> 02:11:45,648
Thank you, thank you.

1919
02:11:47,650 --> 02:11:49,860
Your fucking faces, man.

1920
02:11:53,364 --> 02:11:55,199
What the fuck?

1921
02:11:56,492 --> 02:11:59,870
Hey, I love this thing. I make these
little mix tapes together, you know?

1922
02:12:00,037 --> 02:12:04,291
I put all my favorite songs together.
Which one is this? Number, uh, 11. I love it.

1923
02:12:04,458 --> 02:12:07,503
You know, when you buy a tape
or something or an album...

1924
02:12:07,670 --> 02:12:11,173
...you put it on, and the songs,
the bands put them in some fucking order...

1925
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:15,219
...like they want you to listen to it
in that order. I hate that. Fucking hate that.

1926
02:12:15,386 --> 02:12:19,014
I don't like to be told what to listen to,
when to listen to it, or anything.

1927
02:12:27,523 --> 02:12:28,649
Fuck.

1928
02:12:30,568 --> 02:12:33,696
It's Cosmo. He's Chinese.

1929
02:12:34,447 --> 02:12:37,366
That's why he likes
lighting off firecrackers. Huh?

1930
02:13:12,234 --> 02:13:14,570
Ricky Springfield. He's a buddy of mine.

1931
02:13:31,754 --> 02:13:35,049
Todd, we're leaving, man. Todd.

1932
02:13:35,216 --> 02:13:37,593
Let's go. All right?

1933
02:14:18,384 --> 02:14:19,635
We're leaving.

1934
02:14:19,802 --> 02:14:22,721
Sir. We gotta split, man. We gotta go.

1935
02:14:22,888 --> 02:14:25,641
Aw, come on. You just got here.
Let's hang out, let's party.

1936
02:14:25,808 --> 02:14:29,687
We got somewhere else to go.
We scheduled dinner with friends.

1937
02:14:29,853 --> 02:14:31,814
We're not leaving yet.

1938
02:14:34,483 --> 02:14:38,070
We're here now,
and we want something else from you.

1939
02:14:39,029 --> 02:14:40,781
Hey.

1940
02:14:40,948 --> 02:14:42,366
Hey, hey, hey.

1941
02:14:44,451 --> 02:14:46,787
We want something else from you.

1942
02:14:47,621 --> 02:14:48,664
What?

1943
02:14:48,831 --> 02:14:51,417
Todd, what the hell are you doing, man?
Let's just go.

1944
02:14:52,668 --> 02:14:54,837
In the master bedroom...

1945
02:14:55,838 --> 02:14:59,633
...under the bed in a floor safe.

1946
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,218
Understand?

1947
02:15:01,844 --> 02:15:04,263
- What is the matter with you? Let's go.
- Todd.

1948
02:15:04,430 --> 02:15:05,848
- Come on, man.
- Shut up, Dirk.

1949
02:15:06,015 --> 02:15:08,350
I told you I got a plan. I got a very good plan.

1950
02:15:09,310 --> 02:15:11,020
Are you kidding me, kitty?

1951
02:15:11,186 --> 02:15:12,813
No, I'm not, see?

1952
02:15:12,980 --> 02:15:15,941
I'm not kidding. I want what's in the safe.

1953
02:15:16,108 --> 02:15:19,320
We want what is in the goddamn safe,
in the goddamn master bedroom...

1954
02:15:19,486 --> 02:15:22,865
...in the fucking floor,
in a goddamn fucking floor safe, that's all.

1955
02:15:23,032 --> 02:15:24,491
Todd, don't be crazy, okay?

1956
02:15:24,658 --> 02:15:28,078
Sir, we don't know anything about this.
This is not at all what we wanted.

1957
02:15:28,245 --> 02:15:31,457
Shut the fuck up, Dirk.
Do not reach for your gun, man.

1958
02:15:31,624 --> 02:15:33,375
Don't reach for your gun.

1959
02:15:47,723 --> 02:15:48,766
He went in the bedroom.

1960
02:15:49,391 --> 02:15:51,143
Todd, what the fuck are you doing?

1961
02:15:51,602 --> 02:15:54,730
- He went in the bedroom.
- Todd, when the fuck did you go crazy?

1962
02:15:54,897 --> 02:15:58,067
He's got coke, and he's got cash
in that safe in that bedroom...

1963
02:15:58,233 --> 02:16:01,070
...and if we leave here without it,
we're fucking idiots, man.

1964
02:16:01,236 --> 02:16:03,238
We came here to motherfucking do something.

1965
02:16:03,405 --> 02:16:05,658
And we can fucking do it, all right? You with me?

1966
02:16:05,824 --> 02:16:10,245
Todd, listen to me. Let's just split, man.
Let's just split now. This is not the thing.

1967
02:16:10,412 --> 02:16:12,247
This is not supposed to be the thing.

1968
02:16:12,414 --> 02:16:15,668
That's what I goddamn came here
to motherfucking do.

1969
02:16:15,834 --> 02:16:18,545
And that's what I'm gonna fucking do
right the fuck now.

1970
02:16:18,712 --> 02:16:21,006
Fuck no! Todd, don't!

1971
02:16:21,173 --> 02:16:23,092
- Don't be fucking stupid!
- Todd! Todd!

1972
02:16:26,428 --> 02:16:28,347
- Come on!
- Fuck! Go, man!

1973
02:16:28,514 --> 02:16:29,932
Come on, you puppies.

1974
02:16:34,436 --> 02:16:36,188
It's coming down for puppies!

1975
02:16:43,737 --> 02:16:47,324
Come on, come on, come on. Puppies!

1976
02:16:48,033 --> 02:16:49,993
No!

1977
02:16:51,412 --> 02:16:53,080
Oh, shit.

1978
02:16:53,789 --> 02:16:55,416
Come on!

1979
02:16:59,712 --> 02:17:00,796
Shit.

1980
02:17:16,270 --> 02:17:19,481
Fucking son of a bitch. Oh, God.

1981
02:17:19,648 --> 02:17:22,901
Oh, God. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1982
02:17:23,068 --> 02:17:27,239
Fuck. Fucking stupid motherfucker.

1983
02:17:27,406 --> 02:17:29,533
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

1984
02:17:33,954 --> 02:17:35,664
Oh, fuck.

1985
02:17:36,498 --> 02:17:40,043
Oh, fuck. Son of a bitch.

1986
02:18:26,507 --> 02:18:28,217
Jack?

1987
02:18:35,182 --> 02:18:38,310
Jack, could you please help me?

1988
02:18:48,529 --> 02:18:50,030
I'm...

1989
02:18:55,327 --> 02:18:56,870
Uh...

1990
02:19:01,708 --> 02:19:04,795
I just-- I wanted to come
and say sorry, you know.

1991
02:19:04,962 --> 02:19:06,588
And, um...

1992
02:19:09,258 --> 02:19:12,427
Well, I just wanna know if you can help me, Jack.

1993
02:19:13,095 --> 02:19:15,639
I, um-- I need help.

1994
02:19:18,267 --> 02:19:19,852
And, um...

1995
02:19:20,602 --> 02:19:22,604
...I'm sorry, you know?

1996
02:19:26,400 --> 02:19:28,443
I need help, Jack.

1997
02:19:40,497 --> 02:19:42,624
I'm so fucking sorry, Jack.

1998
02:19:46,545 --> 02:19:48,797
I'm sorry too, kid.

1999
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,677
It's okay, baby.

2000
02:19:53,844 --> 02:19:56,722
- We all need to start again.
- Yeah.

2001
02:19:56,889 --> 02:19:58,807
Okay.

2002
02:19:58,974 --> 02:20:00,851
Shh.

2003
02:20:01,018 --> 02:20:02,686
It's okay.

2004
02:20:06,481 --> 02:20:08,609
It's okay, baby.

2005
02:20:08,775 --> 02:20:10,694
Shh.

2006
02:20:10,861 --> 02:20:14,573
Yeah. You're all right, baby.

2007
02:20:14,740 --> 02:20:17,367
<i>- One more. Let's go. Please. Eleven.
- Eleven.</i>

2008
02:20:17,534 --> 02:20:19,036
Yeah.

2009
02:20:22,998 --> 02:20:25,167
Did I hear someone say deal?

2010
02:20:25,334 --> 02:20:27,502
This weekend and this weekend only...

2011
02:20:27,669 --> 02:20:32,007
...Buck's Super Cool Stereo Store is making
super-cool deals on all name brands.

2012
02:20:32,174 --> 02:20:33,592
We're open. We're ready.

2013
02:20:33,759 --> 02:20:37,512
All you need to do is walk over,
get down, and come inside us.

2014
02:20:39,848 --> 02:20:41,433
Word.

2015
02:20:41,850 --> 02:20:44,603
Cut. Excellent.

2016
02:20:44,770 --> 02:20:47,230
Buck, honey, that was great.

2017
02:21:03,121 --> 02:21:04,665
I said, shut up, Colonel.

2018
02:21:06,833 --> 02:21:08,919
Shut up, Colonel.

2019
02:21:12,631 --> 02:21:14,716
I said, shut up.

2020
02:21:17,469 --> 02:21:24,059
<i>Cinco, cuatro, tres, dos, uno.</i>

2021
02:21:36,405 --> 02:21:39,658
Wait, wait, wait. What happened there?

2022
02:21:39,825 --> 02:21:46,581
That's a Q. That's supposed to be a G.
Oh, man. No, no.

2023
02:22:07,185 --> 02:22:08,770
Go.

2024
02:22:13,942 --> 02:22:15,652
What the heck?

2025
02:22:16,695 --> 02:22:19,281
Naughty, naughty, Candy-

2026
02:22:21,199 --> 02:22:22,659
- Push.
- Okay, ready to push?

2027
02:22:22,826 --> 02:22:24,453
Okay, let's push. Let's push. Let's push.

2028
02:22:25,829 --> 02:22:29,332
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Go, go, go. Push, push, push.

2029
02:22:29,499 --> 02:22:31,126
Yes. Yes.

2030
02:22:31,293 --> 02:22:33,712
- God almighty, fucking Christ.
- We're almost there.

2031
02:22:33,879 --> 02:22:36,631
- No, don't cuss, sweetie.
- One big push for me, all right?

2032
02:22:36,798 --> 02:22:40,218
Big push for the doctor. Big push.
This is it. Big push. Push, push, push.

2033
02:22:43,013 --> 02:22:45,140
- I got it, I got it, yeah.
- He got it.

2034
02:22:45,307 --> 02:22:46,767
It's a boy. It's a boy.

2035
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,902
No hurry, guys. Just sometime this year, huh?

2036
02:22:57,069 --> 02:23:01,573
- Jack, should we put it in the garage?
- Put it where I told you to put it.

2037
02:23:02,699 --> 02:23:03,950
Oh.

2038
02:23:04,117 --> 02:23:05,911
Maurice.

2039
02:23:06,661 --> 02:23:10,040
- You've got to turn a fan on.
- It smells good, doesn't it?

2040
02:23:10,207 --> 02:23:11,666
No. It smells like shit.

2041
02:23:11,833 --> 02:23:14,002
Oh, come on. This is Puerto Rican cooking.

2042
02:23:14,169 --> 02:23:16,505
Everybody's complaining
in the whole neighborhood.

2043
02:23:16,671 --> 02:23:18,673
This is what they're complaining about.
Taste this.

2044
02:23:18,840 --> 02:23:21,551
No, I can't taste it, not now.
I'll taste it later.

2045
02:23:24,096 --> 02:23:26,139
Rollergirl, yoo-hoo.

2046
02:23:26,306 --> 02:23:27,766
Honey, honey. Listen to me.

2047
02:23:27,933 --> 02:23:31,144
Take the dirt on one side of your room
and move it to the other side.

2048
02:23:31,311 --> 02:23:33,688
- Okay.
- Then one side of the room will look clean...

2049
02:23:33,855 --> 02:23:36,191
...that used to look dirty. That'll be good, huh?

2050
02:23:37,692 --> 02:23:41,446
Oh! Johnny Weissmuller. That's my swimmer.

2051
02:23:41,613 --> 02:23:44,616
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Five gold medals, look at that.

2052
02:23:44,783 --> 02:23:47,786
- Say, "Hello, Uncle Jack."
- Oh, look at him.

2053
02:23:47,953 --> 02:23:51,623
- You like Uncle Jack's pool?
- Who is the Olympic-fever baby?

2054
02:23:51,998 --> 02:23:54,251
- Who's the Olympic-fever baby?
- Say, "Hi, Jack."

2055
02:23:54,417 --> 02:23:55,794
- Say, "Hi. Hi."
- "Hi, Jack."

2056
02:23:55,961 --> 02:23:58,630
- "Watch me kick."
- He's not gonna piss in the pool, is he?

2057
02:23:58,797 --> 02:24:02,676
- I don't think so.
- Do you like Uncle Reed? Yes, you do.

2058
02:24:02,843 --> 02:24:04,511
- He is a good boy.
- Yo, Buck.

2059
02:24:04,678 --> 02:24:07,722
I gotta talk to you about
the stereo modification for this system.

2060
02:24:07,889 --> 02:24:09,391
- No technical shit.
- No, no, no.

2061
02:24:09,558 --> 02:24:12,435
If you don't get the right modification
it's not gonna be loud.

2062
02:24:12,602 --> 02:24:14,563
Loud isn't what I want. I don't want loud.

2063
02:24:14,729 --> 02:24:16,064
- I want...
- Mellow.

2064
02:24:16,231 --> 02:24:18,525
Mellow. That's what I want.

2065
02:24:18,692 --> 02:24:20,735
- Okay.
- Buck, I want mellow.

2066
02:24:20,902 --> 02:24:23,572
Mellow. Mellow.

2067
02:24:23,738 --> 02:24:25,240
Yeah.

2068
02:24:25,407 --> 02:24:28,493
Oh, great, honey. Great.

2069
02:24:38,086 --> 02:24:40,088
Are we ready?

2070
02:24:40,255 --> 02:24:44,050
We have got all the time we want.

2071
02:24:44,801 --> 02:24:46,720
What are you looking at?

2072
02:24:47,304 --> 02:24:50,390
- I'm looking at you.
- You're staring.

2073
02:24:50,557 --> 02:24:52,601
You know what I'm staring at?

2074
02:24:53,602 --> 02:24:59,357
I'm staring at the foxiest bitch
in the whole world.

2075
02:25:28,094 --> 02:25:30,555
I've been around this block twice now.

2076
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:32,641
I'm looking for something.

2077
02:25:32,807 --> 02:25:34,392
A clue.

2078
02:25:34,935 --> 02:25:38,063
I've been looking for clues,
and something led me back here.

2079
02:25:38,480 --> 02:25:41,358
Yep. So here I am.

2080
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:45,320
Could have been me, the one that was
at Ringo's place when the shit went down.

2081
02:25:45,487 --> 02:25:49,407
Hey, I know how it is. I've been there.

2082
02:25:49,658 --> 02:25:51,993
We've all done bad things.

2083
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:55,288
We've all had those guilty feelings in our heart.

2084
02:25:55,664 --> 02:26:00,001
You wanna take your brain out of your head
and wash it and scrub it and make it clean.

2085
02:26:00,168 --> 02:26:01,962
Well, no.

2086
02:26:04,005 --> 02:26:06,341
But I'm gonna help you settle this.

2087
02:26:06,508 --> 02:26:09,552
First we're gonna check for holes,
see what we can find.

2088
02:26:09,719 --> 02:26:14,057
Then we're gonna get nice and wet
and you're gonna spread your legs.

2089
02:26:14,474 --> 02:26:18,103
Oh, that's good. So you know me.

2090
02:26:18,270 --> 02:26:20,438
You know my reputation.

2091
02:26:20,605 --> 02:26:24,192
Thirteen inches is a tough load.
I don't treat you gently.

2092
02:26:24,359 --> 02:26:28,530
That's right. I'm Brock Landers.

2093
02:26:29,155 --> 02:26:31,324
So I'm gonna be nice.

2094
02:26:33,118 --> 02:26:35,370
So I'm gonna be nice.

2095
02:26:36,746 --> 02:26:38,790
So I'm gonna be nice.

2096
02:26:38,957 --> 02:26:41,126
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

2097
02:26:41,293 --> 02:26:44,337
Where the fuck is Ringo?

2098
02:27:09,112 --> 02:27:11,197
I am a star.

2099
02:27:11,406 --> 02:27:14,242
I'm a star. I'm a star. I'm a star.

2100
02:27:14,409 --> 02:27:17,620
I am a big, bright, shining star.

2101
02:27:33,720 --> 02:27:35,430
That's right.

2102
02:34:28,634 --> 02:34:30,386
<i>I just...</i>

2103
02:34:37,477 --> 02:34:39,520
<i>I just wanna talk to you.</i>

2104
02:34:44,650 --> 02:34:46,527
<i>I just want...</i>

2105
02:34:48,029 --> 02:34:49,781
<i>Raphael.</i>

2106
