1
00:01:49,515 --> 00:01:51,100
No, Your Honor.
Yes.

2
00:01:51,184 --> 00:01:52,642
I have something to say.

3
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:54,061
You can put me away,

4
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:56,146
but you can't put away
what's going to happen to you

5
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,439
and to this whole country next time.

6
00:01:58,522 --> 00:02:00,107
Next time, we are going to...

7
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:03,068
Don't say anymore.
Leave that for the appeal.

8
00:02:04,444 --> 00:02:07,655
It is the judgment of this court
that the defendant, John Huberman,

9
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:09,948
having been found guilty
of the crime of treason

10
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:12,701
against the United States
by the jury of this court

11
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:15,661
for the southern district of Florida
at Miami,

12
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:19,040
be committed to the custody
of the United States Attorney General

13
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,375
for imprisonment in an institution
of the penitentiary type

14
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:24,419
for a period of 20 years.

15
00:02:25,086 --> 00:02:27,255
And the defendant may be
forthwith remanded

16
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,340
to the custody
of the United States Marshal.

17
00:02:29,423 --> 00:02:30,591
The court is now adjourned.

18
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:32,176
Here she comes.

19
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:39,849
Just a minute, Miss Huberman.
Look this way, would you, please?

20
00:02:40,098 --> 00:02:42,726
We'd like a statement from you,
Miss Huberman, about your father.

21
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,062
For instance, do you think your father
got what he deserved?

22
00:02:45,145 --> 00:02:46,188
Could we say that you're pleased

23
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:49,273
your father's going to pay the penalty
for being a German worker?

24
00:02:50,483 --> 00:02:53,193
Let us know if she tries to leave town.

25
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:09,206
Would you care to pause
for some refreshments, Mr. Hopkins?

26
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:12,084
Alicia, were you really followed
by a policeman?

27
00:03:12,126 --> 00:03:13,252
It sounds very exciting.

28
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:14,586
I'm gonna shoot it out
with them tomorrow.

29
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:16,212
No, thanks. Had enough. So have you.

30
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:19,048
Now, don't be silly.
The important drinking hasn't started yet.

31
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,843
Everybody down here has got
a stuffed fish hanging on the wall.

32
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,885
Where'd they get it? Never seen a fish.

33
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:25,971
How about you, handsome?

34
00:03:26,262 --> 00:03:28,639
Haven't I seen you somewhere before?

35
00:03:28,807 --> 00:03:31,976
Well, it doesn't matter.
I like party crashers.

36
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,770
He's not a party crasher. I brought him.

37
00:03:35,854 --> 00:03:38,064
I wouldn't mind being followed by a cop.

38
00:03:38,147 --> 00:03:41,942
I hate low, underhanded people
like policemen, pussyfooting after you.

39
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:43,944
Of course, I'm a marked woman,
you know.

40
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:46,613
I'm liable to blow up the Panama Canal
any minute now.

41
00:03:46,655 --> 00:03:48,614
- You want some ice in it?
- No, thank you.

42
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:51,909
It's not becoming for a lovely girl like you
to be worried about policemen.

43
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:53,952
- You won't be tomorrow.
- Oh, really?

44
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:57,037
- We sail at 10:00.
- Really? We just sail away?

45
00:03:57,121 --> 00:03:59,082
Show me a fish and I'll show you a liar.

46
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:01,584
What this party needs
is a little glam treatment.

47
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:04,752
We'd better start breaking up, Alicia.
We have to be on board at 9:00.

48
00:04:04,836 --> 00:04:08,256
One week in Havana and this whole thing
about your father will have blown over.

49
00:04:08,338 --> 00:04:09,631
Do you love me, Commodore?

50
00:04:09,673 --> 00:04:13,635
- You're a very beautiful woman.
- I'll have another drink to appreciate that.

51
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:14,761
Where are you going?

52
00:04:14,844 --> 00:04:16,847
- Fishing.
- This time of night, you're mad.

53
00:04:16,929 --> 00:04:18,431
- How about you? Still drinking?
- What's the difference?

54
00:04:18,513 --> 00:04:19,932
There's no fish, day or night.

55
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:22,100
You know something? I like you.

56
00:04:22,185 --> 00:04:24,644
Well, I'll see you on board, Alicia, at 9:00.

57
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:26,270
I have to think that over.

58
00:04:26,354 --> 00:04:29,148
You don't have to pack.
We'll pick up some things in Havana.

59
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,776
I think I'll have to leave him here
to dry out.

60
00:04:31,859 --> 00:04:36,320
I'm very sorry, you all have to go.
It has been a perfectly hideous party.

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,239
Good night.
Good night.

62
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:57,756
There's one more drink left apiece.
Shame about the ice.

63
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,006
- What is?
- Gone.

64
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,383
- Who's gone?
- The ice.

65
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:06,346
Why do you like that song?

66
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:14,018
Because it's a lot of hooey.

67
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:20,649
There's nothing like a love song
to give you a good laugh.

68
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:22,692
That's right.

69
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,322
It's stuffy in here, isn't it?

70
00:05:28,614 --> 00:05:29,907
Might be.

71
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:32,033
What about

72
00:05:35,161 --> 00:05:36,787
we have a picnic?

73
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:39,373
Outside?

74
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,755
It's too stuffy in here for a picnic.

75
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:52,342
- Want to finish that?
- Shame to leave it.

76
00:05:57,346 --> 00:05:59,056
You're quite a boy.

77
00:06:11,649 --> 00:06:14,402
- My car is outside.
- Naturally.

78
00:06:16,404 --> 00:06:18,739
- Want to go for a ride?
- Very much.

79
00:06:22,325 --> 00:06:24,244
What about your guests?

80
00:06:24,618 --> 00:06:27,371
They'll crawl out under their own steam.

81
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:29,790
I'm gonna drive.

82
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,834
That's understood.

83
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,174
Don't you need a coat?

84
00:06:40,716 --> 00:06:42,050
You'll do.

85
00:06:54,894 --> 00:06:58,606
Wait a minute. Let me put this on you,
or you might catch cold.

86
00:07:17,705 --> 00:07:20,248
- How am I doing?
- Not bad.

87
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,252
- Scared?
- No.

88
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,797
- No, you're not scared of anything.
- Not too much.

89
00:07:33,635 --> 00:07:37,263
- This fog gets me.
- It's your hair in your eyes.

90
00:07:43,476 --> 00:07:46,145
What does the speedometer say?

91
00:07:48,146 --> 00:07:49,481
Sixty-five.

92
00:07:55,028 --> 00:07:58,489
I want to make it 80,
and wipe that grin off your face.

93
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:02,992
I don't like gentlemen who grin at me.

94
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:16,921
- A cop.
- What?

95
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:20,340
A policeman is chasing us. Look.

96
00:08:21,049 --> 00:08:22,675
They make me sick.

97
00:08:28,012 --> 00:08:29,974
He wants to talk to you.

98
00:08:32,434 --> 00:08:36,937
Drunken driving. My second offense.
Now I go to jail.

99
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,023
The whole family in jail. Who cares?

100
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,870
Having a time for yourself, aren't you?

101
00:08:56,412 --> 00:08:58,913
People like you ought to be in bed.

102
00:08:58,998 --> 00:09:00,791
- Drunk, huh?
- Just a minute, Officer.

103
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,294
No arguments, mister.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.

104
00:09:12,425 --> 00:09:15,344
- Sorry, but you didn't speak up.
That's all right.

105
00:09:15,762 --> 00:09:17,972
Sure you can handle it?
No trouble.

106
00:09:18,346 --> 00:09:20,015
You ought to know.

107
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:31,232
Where is the ticket?
He didn't give me a ticket.

108
00:09:34,943 --> 00:09:36,987
- What's your name?
- Devlin.

109
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,574
You showed that cop something.
He saluted you.

110
00:09:41,658 --> 00:09:44,035
- Did he?
- I saw him.

111
00:09:44,952 --> 00:09:48,748
Why, you double-crossing buzzard.
You're a cop!

112
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:53,001
- All right, we'll argue later.
- Get away from my car. Get out of my car.

113
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:56,212
- I'm gonna take you home.
- You're not going to take me home at all!

114
00:09:56,253 --> 00:09:57,587
Move over.

115
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:01,758
Come on.

116
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:11,057
Get out of my car, federal cop.
You're crashing my party.

117
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:14,684
Just like that buzzard with the glasses.
Leave me alone!

118
00:10:14,768 --> 00:10:17,604
You're trailing me
to get something on me.

119
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,567
Are you going to calm down?

120
00:10:23,984 --> 00:10:25,653
Good. Now move over.

121
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:30,782
I'm not gonna...

122
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:53,801
You'd better drink that.

123
00:11:07,312 --> 00:11:09,105
Why all this service?

124
00:11:10,481 --> 00:11:12,108
Go on, drink it.

125
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:23,200
Finish it.

126
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:53,185
Feel better?

127
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,145
What do you care how I feel?

128
00:11:59,689 --> 00:12:02,359
You... You cop.

129
00:12:19,414 --> 00:12:21,332
What's this all about?

130
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:25,710
- What's your angle?
- What angle?

131
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:28,338
- About last night.
- Just wanted to be friends.

132
00:12:28,421 --> 00:12:29,923
Friends. Yeah.

133
00:12:30,632 --> 00:12:33,884
- So you could frame me?
- No. I've got a job for you.

134
00:12:34,426 --> 00:12:36,720
Don't tell me. There's only...

135
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:44,310
There's only one job
that you coppers would want me for.

136
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,771
- Well, you can forget it, Mr...
- Devlin.

137
00:12:48,854 --> 00:12:50,357
- What?
- Devlin.

138
00:12:51,274 --> 00:12:53,526
I'm no stool pigeon, Mr. Devlin.

139
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:56,237
My department authorized me
to engage you to do some work for us.

140
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:57,780
It's a job in Brazil.

141
00:12:58,447 --> 00:13:00,365
Go away. The whole thing bores me.

142
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:04,702
Some of the German gentry who were
paying your father are working in Rio.

143
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:08,455
- Ever hear of the I.G. Farben industries?
- I tell you, I'm not interested.

144
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:11,874
Farben has men in South America
planted there before the war.

145
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:15,086
We're cooperating with the
Brazilian government to smoke them out.

146
00:13:15,168 --> 00:13:18,630
- My chief thinks that the daughter of a...
- Of a traitor?

147
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:22,967
He thinks you might be valuable
in the work. They might sort of trust you.

148
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,803
You could make up a little
for your daddy's peculiarities.

149
00:13:25,886 --> 00:13:28,638
- Why should I?
- Patriotism.

150
00:13:28,722 --> 00:13:30,765
That word gives me pain.

151
00:13:30,848 --> 00:13:35,561
No, thank you.
I don't go for patriotism, or patriots.

152
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:37,353
I'd like to dispute that with you.

153
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:40,523
Waving the flag with one hand
and picking pockets with the other.

154
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:43,984
That's your patriotism.
Well, you can have it.

155
00:13:45,236 --> 00:13:47,571
We've had your bungalow wired
for three months.

156
00:13:47,612 --> 00:13:50,364
"Conversation between John Huberman
and daughter Alicia,

157
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:54,118
"6:30 p.m., January 9, 1946,
at Miami Beach, Florida."

158
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,870
Some of the evidence
that wasn't used at the trial.

159
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:58,079
I don't want to hear that.

160
00:13:58,163 --> 00:14:00,456
Relax, hard-boiled, and listen.

161
00:14:01,582 --> 00:14:05,293
There is for both of us,
a mint of money in it, Alicia.

162
00:14:05,627 --> 00:14:07,670
I told you before Christmas
I wouldn't do it.

163
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,798
You don't use your judgment.
You can have anything you want.

164
00:14:11,007 --> 00:14:13,008
- The work is easy.
- I'm not listening, Father.

165
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:16,887
This is not your country, is it?
My mother was born here.

166
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:18,846
We have American citizenship.

167
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:21,724
Where is your judgment?
In your feelings you are German.

168
00:14:21,807 --> 00:14:24,142
You got to listen to me.
You don't know what we stand for.

169
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:28,146
I know what you stand for,
you and your murderous wife.

170
00:14:28,938 --> 00:14:30,482
I've hated you ever since I found out.

171
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:33,484
- My daughter, don't talk to me like that.
- Stay on your side of the table!

172
00:14:33,567 --> 00:14:35,485
Alicia, put your voice down.

173
00:14:35,526 --> 00:14:39,656
I hate you all, and I love
this country. Do you understand that?

174
00:14:41,032 --> 00:14:45,494
I love it. I'll see you all hang
before I raise a finger against it.

175
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,581
Now go on and get out of here,
or, so help me, I'll turn you in.

176
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:56,002
Don't ever come near me or speak
to me again about your rotten schemes.

177
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:03,884
Well, that doesn't prove much.

178
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:07,512
- I didn't turn him in.
- We didn't expect you to.

179
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:10,682
Well, what do you say?

180
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:16,061
Go away and leave me alone.

181
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:19,064
I have my own life to lead.

182
00:15:19,397 --> 00:15:23,234
Good times, that's what I want,
and laughs with people I like.

183
00:15:24,693 --> 00:15:28,405
And no underhanded cops who want
to put me up in a shooting gallery.

184
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:31,657
But people of my own kind,
who treat me right,

185
00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:33,033
and like me and understand me.

186
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,327
Good morning, Alicia.

187
00:15:37,329 --> 00:15:38,329
Hello.

188
00:15:38,414 --> 00:15:39,747
Thought you might need
a hand this morning.

189
00:15:39,831 --> 00:15:41,374
We're sailing with the tide, you know.

190
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:43,209
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

191
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,585
- Don't tell me you've forgotten, my dear?
- Almost.

192
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:50,047
I'll help you pack. Although you don't need
anything. We got everything on board.

193
00:15:50,131 --> 00:15:51,674
Thank you. I'll pack myself.

194
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:54,926
We're moored at
the hotel pier. You know the spot.

195
00:15:55,468 --> 00:15:57,304
- Yes.
- You're a darling.

196
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,431
Sweetest girl I ever knew.

197
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:01,932
See you soon.

198
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,187
Well, what about it?
Plane leaves tomorrow morning, early.

199
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:13,066
All right.

200
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,819
You better tell him.

201
00:16:54,768 --> 00:16:56,269
I'll tell her.

202
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:58,021
See you later.

203
00:17:06,361 --> 00:17:08,363
That's a very nice-Iooking man.

204
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:10,739
You'll be seeing him in Rio.

205
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,784
No, I won't be seeing any men in Rio.

206
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:17,079
Yes, you will.
That's our boss, Paul Prescott.

207
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:23,875
- Did he say anything about the job?
- No.

208
00:17:24,125 --> 00:17:25,418
No hints?

209
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:30,089
No. He had some news about your father
he picked up at the last stop.

210
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:33,299
- What about him?
- He died this morning.

211
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,014
Oh.

212
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:43,392
- How?
- Poison capsule.

213
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:46,727
- He did it himself?
- Yes, in his cell.

214
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:49,730
Sorry.

215
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,317
I don't know why I should feel so bad.

216
00:17:55,986 --> 00:18:00,447
When he told me a few years ago
what he was, everything went to pot.

217
00:18:00,531 --> 00:18:02,991
I didn't care what happened to me.

218
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:05,702
Now I remember how nice he once was,

219
00:18:06,661 --> 00:18:08,496
how nice we both were.

220
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:10,832
Very nice.

221
00:18:11,665 --> 00:18:13,917
It's a very curious feeling.

222
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:18,087
As if something had happened to me,
and not to him.

223
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,965
You see, I don't have to hate him anymore.

224
00:18:22,382 --> 00:18:23,717
Or myself.

225
00:18:24,676 --> 00:18:26,553
We're coming into Rio.

226
00:18:29,847 --> 00:18:31,390
Yes. So we are.

227
00:18:55,743 --> 00:18:58,537
I wonder if the Embassy or someone
can get me a maid.

228
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:01,874
It's a nice apartment, and I don't mind
dusting and sweeping, but I hate cooking.

229
00:19:01,957 --> 00:19:03,000
I'll ask them.

230
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,460
While you're at it,
find out when I go to work,

231
00:19:05,543 --> 00:19:06,753
- and on what.
- Yes, ma'am.

232
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:11,757
- Have another drink?
No, thank you. I've had enough.

233
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:13,216
Whiskey and soda, please.

234
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,259
Well, did you hear that?

235
00:19:15,594 --> 00:19:18,638
I'm practically on the wagon.
That's quite a change.

236
00:19:18,721 --> 00:19:20,139
It's a phase.

237
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,807
You don't think a woman can change?

238
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:26,394
Sure. And change is fun. For a while.

239
00:19:26,477 --> 00:19:27,896
For a while.

240
00:19:29,104 --> 00:19:30,606
What a rat you are, Devlin.

241
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,608
All right. You've been sober for eight days.

242
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:36,903
As far as I know,
you've made no new conquests.

243
00:19:36,945 --> 00:19:38,862
Well, that's something.

244
00:19:38,904 --> 00:19:40,281
Eight days.

245
00:19:40,907 --> 00:19:42,908
Practically whitewashed.

246
00:19:43,241 --> 00:19:44,993
I'm very happy, Dev.

247
00:19:46,077 --> 00:19:49,538
- Why won't you let me be happy?
- Nobody's stopping you.

248
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:56,878
Why don't you give
that copper's brain of yours a rest?

249
00:19:58,672 --> 00:20:01,090
Every time you look at me,
I can see it running over its slogans,

250
00:20:01,131 --> 00:20:04,968
"Once a crook, always a crook.
Once a tramp, always a tramp."

251
00:20:07,303 --> 00:20:11,556
Go on. You can hold my hand.
I won't blackmail you for it afterwards.

252
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:13,849
Scared?

253
00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:17,270
I've always been scared of women,
but I get over it.

254
00:20:17,353 --> 00:20:19,771
And now you're scared of yourself.

255
00:20:19,854 --> 00:20:23,692
- You're afraid you'll fall in love with me.
- That wouldn't be hard.

256
00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:25,568
Now careful, careful.

257
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:28,321
You enjoy making fun of me, don't you?

258
00:20:30,948 --> 00:20:33,158
No, Dev. I'm making fun of myself.

259
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:35,285
I'm pretending I'm a nice, unspoiled child,

260
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,371
whose heart is full of daisies
and buttercups.

261
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,914
Nice daydream. Then what?

262
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:51,673
- I think I will have another drink.
- I thought you'd get around to it.

263
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:53,341
Make it a double.

264
00:20:58,471 --> 00:21:00,889
Why won't you believe in me, Dev?

265
00:21:03,309 --> 00:21:04,809
Just a little.

266
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,104
Why won't you?

267
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,825
I know why you won't, Dev.

268
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,328
You're sore.
You're sore because you've fallen

269
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,996
for the little drunk you tailed in Miami,

270
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:32,498
and you don't like it.
It makes you sick all over, doesn't it?

271
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,750
People will laugh at you.

272
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,085
The invincible Devlin, in love
with someone who isn't worth

273
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:38,462
even wasting the words on. Poor Dev.

274
00:21:38,503 --> 00:21:42,090
In love with a no-good gal.
It must be awful. I'm sorry...

275
00:21:46,093 --> 00:21:48,803
Gentlemen, I assure you
she's the perfect type for the job.

276
00:21:48,846 --> 00:21:52,265
It's not the girl. It's these
German scientists I'm worried about.

277
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:56,144
I simply question why we don't find
some way of taking them into custody.

278
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:59,437
It'd do no good. Even if you
arrest their leader, Alexander Sebastian,

279
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:02,273
tomorrow another Farben man
takes his place, their work goes on.

280
00:22:02,357 --> 00:22:04,025
Yes, you're right.

281
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:07,110
I see, Captain Prescott,
your method is the best way.

282
00:22:07,194 --> 00:22:09,655
Well, she's good
at making friends with gentlemen,

283
00:22:09,738 --> 00:22:12,990
and we want somebody inside his house,
in his confidence.

284
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:15,201
You have faith in this procedure,
Captain Prescott?

285
00:22:15,284 --> 00:22:16,327
Yes. With somebody on the inside...

286
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:18,704
- Have you consulted the young lady?
- No, not yet.

287
00:22:18,746 --> 00:22:22,415
As a matter of fact, our man, Devlin,
just brought her down here the other day.

288
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:24,709
Now we're waiting for Sebastian
to come back to Rio.

289
00:22:24,792 --> 00:22:27,211
Has your Mr. Devlin told her
the nature of the work?

290
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:29,338
No. We haven't discussed it
with him at all,

291
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:31,048
but I can set your mind at rest about her.

292
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:33,884
- You're sure of her political side?
Oh, yes.

293
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:38,887
Well, there is nothing to be lost
if we proceed as you advise.

294
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:42,098
Now that's fine.
I'll give Devlin his instructions right away.

295
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,942
It's nice out here.

296
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:48,029
Let's not go out for dinner. Let's stay here.

297
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:50,906
We have to eat.

298
00:23:51,907 --> 00:23:54,283
We can eat here. I'll cook.

299
00:23:55,785 --> 00:23:59,621
- I thought you didn't like to cook.
- No, I don't like to cook.

300
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:06,002
But I have a chicken in the icebox,
and you're eating it.

301
00:24:06,084 --> 00:24:08,378
What about all the washing up
afterwards?

302
00:24:08,462 --> 00:24:10,756
We'll eat it with our fingers.

303
00:24:11,047 --> 00:24:15,676
- Don't we need any plates?
- Yes. One for you and one for me.

304
00:24:19,596 --> 00:24:22,599
Would you mind
if I had dinner with you tonight?

305
00:24:22,933 --> 00:24:26,435
I'd be delighted. Where are you going?

306
00:24:27,144 --> 00:24:31,273
If we're gonna stay in, I have to telephone
the hotel, see if there are any messages.

307
00:24:31,315 --> 00:24:34,066
- Do you have to?
- I have to.

308
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,288
- This is a very strange love affair.
- Why?

309
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,876
Maybe the fact that you don't love me.

310
00:24:56,544 --> 00:24:59,255
Hello, Palace Hotel?

311
00:25:01,089 --> 00:25:04,341
This is T.R. Devlin.
Are there any messages for me?

312
00:25:04,925 --> 00:25:07,719
When I don't love you, I'll let you know.

313
00:25:08,011 --> 00:25:11,806
- You haven't said anything.
- Actions speak louder than words.

314
00:25:12,348 --> 00:25:14,976
There is? Good. Read it to me, please.

315
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:28,027
Prescott wants me over right away.

316
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,405
- Did he say what about?
- No.

317
00:25:31,322 --> 00:25:33,907
- Maybe it's our assignment.
- Probably.

318
00:25:42,498 --> 00:25:44,417
Want me to bring
anything back with me?

319
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,962
Yes. What about a nice bottle of wine
to celebrate?

320
00:25:49,963 --> 00:25:53,299
- What time should I come back?
- 7:00.

321
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,139
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

322
00:26:19,196 --> 00:26:20,614
What is it, Devlin?
What's the matter?

323
00:26:20,697 --> 00:26:21,906
I don't know if she'll do it.

324
00:26:21,989 --> 00:26:23,366
What do you mean you don't think she...

325
00:26:23,408 --> 00:26:24,909
You haven't discussed it with her,
have you?

326
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,827
No. I didn't know
what the job was until this moment.

327
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,245
What do you mean she wouldn't do it?

328
00:26:28,286 --> 00:26:30,663
Well, I don't think she's that type
of woman. She strikes me to be...

329
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:33,165
I don't understand your attitude.

330
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:38,128
- Why do you think she won't do it?
- Well, she's had no experience.

331
00:26:38,212 --> 00:26:41,632
Come now. What experience
does she lack, do you think?

332
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:45,050
She's never been trained for that kind
of work. They'll see through her.

333
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,803
This woman was chosen not only because
her father gives her an ideal background,

334
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,223
but because Sebastian knows her.

335
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:55,059
Yes. He was once in love with her.

336
00:26:57,269 --> 00:26:58,812
I didn't know that.

337
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:01,147
I don't see why we're arguing
about petty things like this?

338
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:03,024
We've got important work to do.

339
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:04,650
Sebastian's house is a cover-up

340
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:07,152
for whatever this Farben Group is up to
here in Rio.

341
00:27:07,236 --> 00:27:09,071
We've got to get Miss Huberman
inside that house

342
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:10,404
and find out what's going on there.

343
00:27:10,446 --> 00:27:11,489
Yes, that's right.

344
00:27:11,572 --> 00:27:12,907
So I think you'd better go back
to Miss Huberman

345
00:27:12,949 --> 00:27:14,699
and explain to her what she has to do.

346
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:15,909
I...

347
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:18,036
What is it?
- Nothing, sir.

348
00:27:18,328 --> 00:27:20,704
I thought you were gonna say something.

349
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:22,790
How is the meeting to be arranged?

350
00:27:22,831 --> 00:27:26,919
We discussed that. I think the Riding Club
would be the best place.

351
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:30,004
Sebastian usually rides there
in the mornings.

352
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:33,090
So the rest is up to you
and Miss Huberman.

353
00:27:34,341 --> 00:27:36,927
- Okay, Devlin, that's all.
- All right.

354
00:27:50,021 --> 00:27:52,147
Dev, is that you?
- Uh-huh.

355
00:27:52,982 --> 00:27:56,318
I'm glad you're late.
This chicken took longer than I expected.

356
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,735
What did they say?

357
00:27:57,819 --> 00:27:59,946
Hope it isn't done too much.

358
00:28:01,114 --> 00:28:03,074
It caught fire once.

359
00:28:03,699 --> 00:28:08,912
I think it's better if I cut it up out here,
unless you want a half of one to yourself.

360
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,998
We're going to have knives and forks
after all.

361
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:14,624
I've decided we're going to eat in style.

362
00:28:14,666 --> 00:28:19,045
Marriage must be wonderful,
with this sort of thing going on every day.

363
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:24,341
I wonder if it's too cold out here.
Maybe we should eat inside.

364
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:32,056
Hasn't something like this
happened before?

365
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:36,685
What's the matter?

366
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,230
Don't look so tense. Troubles?

367
00:28:42,273 --> 00:28:44,942
Well, handsome, I think
you better tell mama what's going on,

368
00:28:45,026 --> 00:28:48,444
or all this secrecy is going to ruin
my little dinner.

369
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:52,198
Come on, Mr. D,
what is darkening your brow?

370
00:28:52,948 --> 00:28:54,866
- After dinner.
- No, now.

371
00:28:56,994 --> 00:29:00,287
Look, I'll make it easy for you.
The time has come when you must tell me

372
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,832
that you have a wife
and two adorable children,

373
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:06,126
and this madness between us
can't go on any longer.

374
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:09,045
I bet you've heard that line often enough.

375
00:29:12,006 --> 00:29:14,341
Right below the belt every time.

376
00:29:16,134 --> 00:29:18,428
- That isn't fair, Dev.
- Skip it.

377
00:29:19,596 --> 00:29:22,890
We have other things to talk about.
We've got a job.

378
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:25,851
So there is a job.

379
00:29:28,187 --> 00:29:30,688
You remember a man named Sebastian?

380
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,399
- Alex Sebastian?
- Yes.

381
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:38,069
One of my father's friends, yes.

382
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,864
- He had quite a crush on you.
- I wasn't very responsive.

383
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,285
He's here. The head of a large
German business concern.

384
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,829
His family always had money.

385
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:52,623
He's part of the combine
that built the German war machine,

386
00:29:52,706 --> 00:29:54,833
- and hopes to keep on going.
- Something big?

387
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:58,002
It has all the earmarks
of being something big.

388
00:29:58,294 --> 00:30:00,213
We have to contact him.

389
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,103
Go on. Let's have all of it.

390
00:30:18,186 --> 00:30:21,397
We're meeting him tomorrow.
The rest is up to you.

391
00:30:22,189 --> 00:30:25,109
You've got to work on him and land him.

392
00:30:25,151 --> 00:30:28,610
Mata Hari. She makes love for the papers.

393
00:30:29,404 --> 00:30:34,032
There are no papers. You land him.
Find out what's going on inside his house,

394
00:30:34,116 --> 00:30:37,451
what the group around him is up to,
and report to us.

395
00:30:39,453 --> 00:30:43,707
I suppose you knew about
this pretty little job of mine all the time.

396
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:46,959
No, I only just found out about it.

397
00:30:48,503 --> 00:30:50,296
Did you say anything?

398
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:55,133
I mean, that maybe I wasn't the girl
for such shenanigans.

399
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:00,554
I figured that was up to you,
if you'd care to back out.

400
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:02,347
I suppose you told them Alicia Huberman

401
00:31:02,432 --> 00:31:04,850
will have this Sebastian eating
out of her hand in a couple of weeks.

402
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:08,561
- She's good at that. Always was.
- I didn't say anything.

403
00:31:10,938 --> 00:31:16,401
Not a word for that
little lovesick lady you left an hour ago?

404
00:31:18,111 --> 00:31:22,281
- I told you, that's the assignment.
- Well, now, don't get sore, Dev.

405
00:31:24,157 --> 00:31:27,744
I'm only fishing for a little birdcall
from my dream man.

406
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:32,539
One little remark such as,

407
00:31:32,748 --> 00:31:36,000
"How dare you gentlemen
suggest that Alicia Huberman,

408
00:31:36,042 --> 00:31:39,837
"the new Miss Huberman,
be submitted to so ugly a fate?"

409
00:31:40,295 --> 00:31:41,922
That's not funny.

410
00:31:47,594 --> 00:31:49,888
Do you want me to take the job?

411
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:53,641
- You're answering for yourself.
- I am asking you.

412
00:31:53,724 --> 00:31:55,267
It's up to you.

413
00:31:57,185 --> 00:31:58,812
Not a peep?

414
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,858
Darling, what you didn't tell them, tell me.

415
00:32:05,107 --> 00:32:09,695
That you believe I'm nice, and that
I love you, and I'll never change back.

416
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:12,990
I'm waiting for your answer.

417
00:32:18,077 --> 00:32:20,121
What a little pal you are.

418
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:24,999
Never believing me.

419
00:32:25,708 --> 00:32:28,794
Not a word of faith.
Just down the drain with Alicia.

420
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,839
That's where she belongs.

421
00:32:32,172 --> 00:32:34,383
Oh, Dev. Dev...

422
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,062
- When do I go to work for Uncle Sam?
- Tomorrow morning.

423
00:33:01,905 --> 00:33:05,742
We shouldn't have had this
out here. It's all cold now.

424
00:33:07,494 --> 00:33:09,245
What are you looking for?

425
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:13,039
I had a bottle of champagne.
I must have left it somewhere.

426
00:33:22,839 --> 00:33:25,383
In case you're asked,
I'm with Pan American Airways.

427
00:33:25,467 --> 00:33:28,553
- As Devlin?
- Yes. Public relations office.

428
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,222
Anything else?

429
00:33:31,388 --> 00:33:34,224
No. Except, we met on the plane
coming in from Miami.

430
00:33:34,266 --> 00:33:36,392
The less detail the better.

431
00:33:48,611 --> 00:33:50,905
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yes.

432
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,699
We'll go by him easy.
Let him spot you. Come on.

433
00:34:23,223 --> 00:34:25,682
I guess I'm the girl nobody remembers.

434
00:34:25,809 --> 00:34:27,727
- Was it Sebastian?
- Yes.

435
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:30,729
We'll stick around,
give him another chance.

436
00:35:17,685 --> 00:35:20,186
My dear Alicia.
Will you forgive me for being late?

437
00:35:20,229 --> 00:35:22,981
Last-minute conference at the office.
You got my message?

438
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:24,732
Yes. It's all right, Alex.

439
00:35:24,816 --> 00:35:26,192
Sweet of you to wait.

440
00:35:26,276 --> 00:35:30,028
- I was afraid you might run off.
- I'm not that easily put off.

441
00:35:30,112 --> 00:35:32,613
I was too anxious to meet you again.

442
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,157
You know, I'm tired.

443
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:38,035
The worst thing about business
is it makes you feel old and look old.

444
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,829
You seem to have escaped all of that.

445
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,372
Four years of dullness and disintegration.

446
00:35:42,414 --> 00:35:43,540
Awful.

447
00:35:43,623 --> 00:35:46,000
Alex, you look younger
than you did in Washington.

448
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:49,378
It's a temporary improvement
entirely due to your presence, my dear.

449
00:35:49,462 --> 00:35:52,213
You always affected me like a tonic.

450
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:54,257
Perhaps now, with you here in Rio,

451
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,426
unless you insist
on running away from me again.

452
00:35:59,136 --> 00:36:00,888
- Would you like another drink?
- Yes, thank you.

453
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:11,730
You know him?

454
00:36:12,439 --> 00:36:14,732
No, I don't think so, but he seems familiar.

455
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:16,692
Captain Prescott. Intelligence man.

456
00:36:16,734 --> 00:36:19,195
He's down here
as part of the Washington espionage.

457
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:21,322
The American Embassy's
loaded with them.

458
00:36:21,405 --> 00:36:22,573
Really?

459
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,866
He's rather handsome, isn't he?

460
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:28,285
I'm allergic to American agents.

461
00:36:28,827 --> 00:36:31,371
Their fine points
don't particularly appeal to me.

462
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:34,123
They've bothered you
since you came down?

463
00:36:34,207 --> 00:36:35,958
No, not yet.

464
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,754
They were troublesome in Miami?

465
00:36:41,254 --> 00:36:45,759
Yes, that's why I left right after the trial,
to get away from their snooping.

466
00:36:45,841 --> 00:36:48,427
I wondered why you left your father.

467
00:36:50,095 --> 00:36:52,098
He insisted. He was so unselfish.

468
00:36:52,139 --> 00:36:55,225
He kept worrying about me,
begging me to leave.

469
00:36:56,351 --> 00:36:58,519
I had no idea he was going to die.

470
00:36:58,602 --> 00:37:03,231
Many things have died for all of us.
We mustn't let our spirit die with them.

471
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:08,736
Perhaps I can help you to forget. I'd like to.

472
00:37:09,111 --> 00:37:10,445
It's odd,

473
00:37:12,531 --> 00:37:15,116
but I feel at home with you.

474
00:37:15,826 --> 00:37:20,495
You know, my dear,
I knew this was going to happen.

475
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:23,665
I knew, when we met the other day

476
00:37:23,748 --> 00:37:27,292
that if I saw you again,
I'd feel what I used to for you.

477
00:37:27,752 --> 00:37:29,336
The same hunger.

478
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:32,755
You're so lovely, my dear.

479
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:36,342
Now I'm going to make
a fool of myself again.

480
00:37:36,425 --> 00:37:39,386
There's someone else, of course.
Who is it this time?

481
00:37:39,469 --> 00:37:41,680
That Mr. Devlin you were with?

482
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:43,556
There is no one.

483
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:45,933
He seemed attentive.

484
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:51,354
Mr. Devlin has pestered me
with his attentiveness ever since I arrived.

485
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:53,440
I met him on a plane from Miami.

486
00:37:53,481 --> 00:37:55,066
You made a pretty couple.

487
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,110
Oh, no, Alex.
Mr. Devlin doesn't interest me.

488
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:04,365
I was so Ionely that day,
I could have gone riding with Peter Rabbit.

489
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,744
You'll let me help your Ioneliness?

490
00:38:10,829 --> 00:38:14,541
You're very sweet to forget
what a brat I was once.

491
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:19,378
My dear, I shall test out your repentance
at once.

492
00:38:20,336 --> 00:38:22,797
Will you have dinner with me again
tomorrow night?

493
00:38:22,839 --> 00:38:25,300
- Thank you very much.
- My house?

494
00:38:27,301 --> 00:38:28,761
Yes. How nice.

495
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,845
My mother's giving a dinner party.

496
00:38:30,887 --> 00:38:32,472
She won't mind an extra guest?

497
00:38:32,555 --> 00:38:35,266
An old friend is never an extra guest.

498
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:41,103
- Well, should we order now?
- Yes, I'm starved.

499
00:38:42,897 --> 00:38:45,024
Now, let's see.

500
00:38:45,107 --> 00:38:47,650
What shall we have
for our first dinner together?

501
00:39:01,997 --> 00:39:03,123
Good evening.

502
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:04,540
Very good.

503
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:06,751
Yes. Yes, isn't it?

504
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:10,587
I'd like you to wear these.
They're rented for the occasion.

505
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:17,676
- Would you help me, please?
- Why, yes. Certainly.

506
00:39:18,177 --> 00:39:21,012
- Thank you.
- So the old boy knew me?

507
00:39:21,054 --> 00:39:23,056
Yes, he thought you were very handsome.

508
00:39:23,138 --> 00:39:24,390
You don't say!

509
00:39:24,432 --> 00:39:25,891
Sorry I'm not going with you.

510
00:39:25,974 --> 00:39:27,601
- Dev will pick those up later.
- All right.

511
00:39:27,684 --> 00:39:30,479
Try to memorize the names
of all the people you see there tonight.

512
00:39:30,562 --> 00:39:31,647
The men, I mean.

513
00:39:31,729 --> 00:39:33,856
And get their nationalities.
That's very important.

514
00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:36,108
You mean the Germans?
That won't be difficult for me.

515
00:39:36,191 --> 00:39:38,944
And I suggest
that you don't ask any questions.

516
00:39:39,027 --> 00:39:40,445
Just use your eyes and ears.

517
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:44,074
They're a pretty keen and desperate
bunch. Don't underestimate them.

518
00:39:44,156 --> 00:39:45,825
Thank you for your instructions.
Good evening.

519
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:49,160
By the way, unless you have something
very urgent to report,

520
00:39:49,244 --> 00:39:52,122
I suggest you two keep shy of each other
for the next few days,

521
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:54,749
that's in case Sebastian's people
want to check on you after your visit.

522
00:39:54,833 --> 00:39:56,834
- Yes, I understand. Good evening.
- That's all. Good luck.

523
00:39:56,917 --> 00:39:58,252
Good night.

524
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:38,493
Good evening. I'm Miss Huberman.
Will you tell Mr. Sebastian that I'm here?

525
00:41:30,286 --> 00:41:31,954
- Miss Huberman?
- Yes.

526
00:41:32,038 --> 00:41:34,706
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.

527
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:35,791
Not at all.

528
00:41:35,832 --> 00:41:38,377
You resemble your father very much.

529
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:39,711
I'm Alex's mother.

530
00:41:39,795 --> 00:41:41,295
I knew when I saw you.

531
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:45,174
Alex has always admired you.
Now, at last, I know why.

532
00:41:45,423 --> 00:41:46,759
You're very kind.

533
00:41:46,842 --> 00:41:50,803
You did not testify at your father's trial.
We thought that unusual.

534
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:52,471
He didn't want me to.

535
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,807
He refused to let his lawyers
call me on the stand.

536
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:56,225
I wonder why.

537
00:41:56,308 --> 00:41:57,559
Hello.

538
00:41:58,434 --> 00:41:59,602
Alicia.

539
00:42:00,561 --> 00:42:01,896
I'm so glad.

540
00:42:01,979 --> 00:42:03,648
- You met my mother?
- Yes, we just met.

541
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,940
You didn't meet Alicia when we were

542
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,566
in Washington four years ago,
did you, Mother?

543
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,151
I don't know where you were at the time.

544
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,196
Alex, I think we should join
our other guests.

545
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,992
- May I take your wrap?
- Thank you.

546
00:42:27,793 --> 00:42:31,838
Miss Huberman, may I present
Eric Mathis.

547
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:34,716
- How do you do?
How do you do?

548
00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:37,884
William Rossner.

549
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,011
How do you do?

550
00:42:40,553 --> 00:42:42,012
Very honored.

551
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,056
Emil Hupka.

552
00:42:44,849 --> 00:42:46,349
How do you do?

553
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,601
Delighted.

554
00:42:48,768 --> 00:42:50,270
And Mr. Knerr.

555
00:42:54,314 --> 00:42:55,940
And Dr. Anderson.

556
00:42:56,817 --> 00:42:58,276
Dr. Anderson.

557
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:01,029
It gives me great pleasure.

558
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:07,034
Dr. Anderson's our guest of honor tonight.

559
00:43:07,075 --> 00:43:10,703
You mustn't bore Miss Huberman,
Alex, with discourses on science.

560
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:12,371
Not before dinner, anyway.

561
00:43:12,455 --> 00:43:14,457
Dinner is served, madame.

562
00:43:17,418 --> 00:43:21,253
Dr. Anderson,
you will sit beside me over there.

563
00:43:21,462 --> 00:43:24,298
Eric, you will sit next to Miss Huberman.

564
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:27,634
You have just come from Spain, señora?

565
00:43:27,759 --> 00:43:29,761
A few weeks ago. It seems ages.

566
00:43:29,803 --> 00:43:33,348
Travel does not mean anything anymore.
It goes so swiftly.

567
00:43:33,514 --> 00:43:34,557
One has the feeling...

568
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,475
That bottle doesn't belong here.

569
00:43:36,558 --> 00:43:37,684
Shh. You're mistaken.

570
00:43:37,768 --> 00:43:42,146
We can expect rocket ships to be
carrying us around the ocean very soon.

571
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,398
We can expect many strange things.

572
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:46,232
See a good movie this afternoon, Eric?

573
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:47,567
No, I was disappointed.

574
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:49,110
Must have been a comedy.

575
00:43:49,152 --> 00:43:51,905
You know, Eric loves to go to the movies
to cry.

576
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:53,822
He's very sentimental.

577
00:43:57,117 --> 00:44:00,037
It takes nearly as long
to go from the city to the airport,

578
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:01,996
as it does to cross the...

579
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:19,386
I'm afraid, gentlemen,
that something must be done about Emil.

580
00:44:19,468 --> 00:44:20,929
I don't know.

581
00:44:21,637 --> 00:44:24,556
It was an understandable slip.
The man was tired.

582
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,434
No. But it was a very dangerous slip.

583
00:44:27,642 --> 00:44:31,062
It's not the first one. There have been
several other lapses before.

584
00:44:31,145 --> 00:44:33,480
There will be more if you permit him.

585
00:44:33,563 --> 00:44:35,857
That's bad. That's very bad.

586
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:39,194
I think, gentlemen,
you can leave it to me to find some way.

587
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:42,822
When you drive up to Petrópolis,
the road winds quite a bit.

588
00:44:42,905 --> 00:44:44,490
It is very high.

589
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,158
There are some very awkward turns.

590
00:44:48,118 --> 00:44:52,496
I'm sure I will not have any difficulty
in getting Emil to give me a lift in his car.

591
00:44:52,538 --> 00:44:54,999
It's quite a trick to jump clear.

592
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:58,376
I'll just have to be careful, that is all.

593
00:44:58,835 --> 00:45:01,129
Turned my ankle the last time.

594
00:45:10,886 --> 00:45:15,474
Madame says will you join the others,
or will you take your coffee in here?

595
00:45:15,557 --> 00:45:18,393
I think we'll take coffee in here, Emil.

596
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:22,646
I'm very sorry, gentlemen,

597
00:45:22,688 --> 00:45:24,815
to make such an exhibition.

598
00:45:24,982 --> 00:45:27,984
Nonsense. We all have nerves.

599
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:30,610
You have been overworking.

600
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:32,488
Don't you think, Sebastian?

601
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:34,781
You need to rest.

602
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:38,242
- Your health is very important to us.
- That's very considerate.

603
00:45:38,326 --> 00:45:40,203
I am very tired,

604
00:45:40,245 --> 00:45:44,831
so now, I think, perhaps
if you'll make my pardon to the ladies,

605
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:47,375
Alex, for my leaving so early, then I...

606
00:45:47,417 --> 00:45:50,711
Maybe, Emil, it would be better
if I came with you.

607
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:54,006
Perhaps if you tried to drive yourself
all the way up to Petrópolis,

608
00:45:54,089 --> 00:45:56,300
it might be too much for you.

609
00:45:56,591 --> 00:45:58,259
I shall drive you.

610
00:45:58,509 --> 00:45:59,802
No.

611
00:45:59,886 --> 00:46:03,180
That would be too much for you.
All that way, it is too much to ask.

612
00:46:03,221 --> 00:46:05,223
Nonsense. I'd love to go.

613
00:46:05,724 --> 00:46:07,266
Come on, Emil.

614
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:09,185
Good night, gentlemen.

615
00:46:09,227 --> 00:46:10,853
Good night, Alex.

616
00:46:11,228 --> 00:46:13,688
I hope you feel better
in the morning, Emil.

617
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:14,856
Thank you.

618
00:46:14,898 --> 00:46:19,109
And I'm very sorry
to make a scene before strangers.

619
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,487
Very sorry.

620
00:46:21,528 --> 00:46:23,404
Thank you, Alex, for an excellent dinner.

621
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,408
And please tell your mother for me
that the dessert was superb.

622
00:46:39,001 --> 00:46:41,211
Miss Huberman has been gone
a long time.

623
00:46:41,295 --> 00:46:44,548
Mother, is it necessary for you to
always address Alicia as Miss Huberman?

624
00:46:44,631 --> 00:46:46,925
I do wish you'd be
a little more cordial to her.

625
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:49,260
Really? I thought I was behaving very well.

626
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:51,429
- Has she been complaining about me?
- No.

627
00:46:51,512 --> 00:46:52,930
I'm grateful.

628
00:46:52,972 --> 00:46:54,639
You might smile at her.

629
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:58,268
Wouldn't it be a little too much
if we both grinned at her like idiots?

630
00:46:58,309 --> 00:47:00,185
Please, Mother, I want to enjoy myself.

631
00:47:00,270 --> 00:47:04,148
- Is it so boring to sit with me alone?
- Not at all.

632
00:47:11,571 --> 00:47:12,612
Hello.

633
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:13,906
- Hello.
- I thought I saw you.

634
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,282
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

635
00:47:15,323 --> 00:47:17,576
- Great turnout, isn't it?
- Yes.

636
00:47:19,202 --> 00:47:20,745
Where are they?

637
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:22,455
In a box, in the stand.

638
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:25,750
I don't think they can see us,
Alex and his mother.

639
00:47:25,833 --> 00:47:29,377
Don't telephone me anymore.
Just rely upon my popping up.

640
00:47:29,752 --> 00:47:32,171
- Can you hear me?
- Sure. Go ahead.

641
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,341
- Heard of a Dr. Anderson?
- No.

642
00:47:36,883 --> 00:47:38,509
He's some kind of a scientist.

643
00:47:38,593 --> 00:47:43,388
Kind face, 60 years old, gray hair,
deep crease in the forehead.

644
00:47:44,264 --> 00:47:46,183
- Tall or short?
- Short.

645
00:47:47,059 --> 00:47:49,685
- Emil Hupka. Heard of him?
- No.

646
00:47:51,437 --> 00:47:56,149
He made quite a scene
about a wine bottle the other night.

647
00:47:56,232 --> 00:47:57,817
Didn't like the vintage?

648
00:47:57,859 --> 00:48:00,569
He seemed to think
there was something else in the bottle.

649
00:48:00,653 --> 00:48:02,154
- Was there?
- No.

650
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:04,365
It was wine. We drank it.

651
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:07,658
Has he pulled anything since?

652
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:10,118
Haven't seen him since.

653
00:48:12,038 --> 00:48:13,497
Anything else?

654
00:48:15,165 --> 00:48:16,833
Nothing important.

655
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:20,336
Just a minor item,
but you may want it for the record.

656
00:48:20,419 --> 00:48:21,754
What is it?

657
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:25,675
You can add Sebastian's name
to my list of playmates.

658
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:33,847
- Pretty fast work.
- That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

659
00:48:33,931 --> 00:48:35,224
Skip it.

660
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:39,852
- Are you betting on this race?
- No.

661
00:48:40,395 --> 00:48:42,938
Alex says Number 10 is sure to win.
He knows the owner.

662
00:48:43,021 --> 00:48:44,189
Thanks for the tip.

663
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:46,358
Alex says they've been
holding him back, but...

664
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,903
I can't help recalling some of your remarks
about being a new woman.

665
00:48:49,985 --> 00:48:52,321
Daisies and buttercups, wasn't it?

666
00:48:52,405 --> 00:48:53,697
You idiot.

667
00:48:53,738 --> 00:48:56,367
What are you sore about?
You knew very well what I was doing.

668
00:48:56,408 --> 00:48:58,033
- Did I?
- You could've stopped me.

669
00:48:58,075 --> 00:49:00,703
Just one word, but no, you wouldn't,
you threw me at him.

670
00:49:00,744 --> 00:49:02,287
I threw you at nobody.

671
00:49:02,371 --> 00:49:03,914
Didn't you tell me to go ahead?

672
00:49:03,997 --> 00:49:07,000
A man doesn't tell a woman what to do,
she tells herself.

673
00:49:07,084 --> 00:49:10,044
You almost had me believing
that hokey-pokey miracle of yours

674
00:49:10,128 --> 00:49:12,380
that a woman like you
could ever change her spots.

675
00:49:12,422 --> 00:49:14,840
- You're rotten.
- That's why I didn't try to stop you.

676
00:49:14,923 --> 00:49:17,759
- The answer had to come from you.
- I see. Some kind of love test.

677
00:49:17,801 --> 00:49:19,260
That's right.

678
00:49:20,594 --> 00:49:21,929
You never believed in me, anyway,

679
00:49:21,971 --> 00:49:24,431
- so what's the difference?
- Lucky for both of us I didn't.

680
00:49:24,472 --> 00:49:27,267
It wouldn't have been pretty
if I had believed in you, if I'd figured,

681
00:49:27,308 --> 00:49:31,562
"She'd never be able to go through
with this, she's been made over by love."

682
00:49:31,603 --> 00:49:35,440
If you only once had said that you love me.
Oh, Dev.

683
00:49:36,108 --> 00:49:39,235
Listen, you chalked up another boyfriend,
that's all. No harm done.

684
00:49:39,277 --> 00:49:40,403
I hate you.

685
00:49:40,445 --> 00:49:43,030
There's no occasion to.
You're doing good work.

686
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,450
Number 10 is out in front, looks like
Sebastian knows how to pick them.

687
00:49:46,491 --> 00:49:48,951
Is that all you have to say to me?

688
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:52,163
Dry your eyes, baby. It's out of character.

689
00:49:52,246 --> 00:49:55,540
Except keep on your toes,
it's a tough job we're on.

690
00:49:56,833 --> 00:49:59,460
Snap out of it. Here comes Dreamboat.

691
00:50:00,919 --> 00:50:04,422
Hello, Alex.
It was so exciting. A beautiful horse.

692
00:50:04,464 --> 00:50:06,466
- Do you remember Mr. Devlin?
- How do you do?

693
00:50:06,549 --> 00:50:09,093
Hello. Alicia tells me
you had a bet on Number 10.

694
00:50:09,176 --> 00:50:12,137
Sorry I didn't get the tip earlier. So long.

695
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:14,097
See you sometime, Dev.

696
00:50:14,473 --> 00:50:16,516
It was a wonderful race,
did you have much money on the winner?

697
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,268
I didn't see the race.

698
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:21,019
Didn't you? I thought I saw you
looking through your field glasses.

699
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,480
I was watching you and your friend,
Mr. Devlin.

700
00:50:23,522 --> 00:50:25,774
I presume that's why you left
my mother and me,

701
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,400
you had an appointment to meet him.

702
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:29,109
Don't be absurd.

703
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,070
I met him purely by accident.

704
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,614
You didn't seem very anxious
to get away from him.

705
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,157
- He's just...
- I watched you.

706
00:50:36,866 --> 00:50:39,619
I thought maybe you're in love with him.

707
00:50:39,993 --> 00:50:42,954
- Don't talk like that, I detest him.
- Really?

708
00:50:43,789 --> 00:50:46,499
- He's very good-Iooking.
- Alex,

709
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:49,877
I've told you before.
Mr. Devlin doesn't mean a thing to me.

710
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,962
I'd like to be convinced.

711
00:50:52,504 --> 00:50:54,589
Would you, maybe,
care to convince me, Alicia,

712
00:50:54,673 --> 00:50:57,300
that Mr. Devlin means nothing to you?

713
00:51:01,512 --> 00:51:05,057
Pleased to hear, Señor Barbosa,
that our little theatrical plan is working.

714
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:07,433
We've got hold of something concrete
for a change.

715
00:51:07,517 --> 00:51:09,477
I'm delighted, gentlemen. What is it?

716
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:13,063
Professor Wilhelm Otto Renzeler
is working here in Brazil.

717
00:51:13,146 --> 00:51:14,981
One of Germany's scientific wizards.

718
00:51:15,022 --> 00:51:16,649
- I didn't know he was here.
- Oh, yes.

719
00:51:16,732 --> 00:51:19,402
He's living and experimenting
in Sebastian's house.

720
00:51:19,485 --> 00:51:20,736
They call him Dr. Anderson.

721
00:51:24,531 --> 00:51:25,615
Excuse me, sir.

722
00:51:25,698 --> 00:51:29,034
Miss Huberman wishes to see
Captain Prescott or Mr. Devlin.

723
00:51:29,076 --> 00:51:30,077
What do you mean? She's here?

724
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,161
Yes, sir.

725
00:51:31,245 --> 00:51:33,246
Show her in, Ribero.
- Yes, sir.

726
00:51:33,664 --> 00:51:35,874
I don't like this.
I don't like her coming here.

727
00:51:35,957 --> 00:51:39,502
She's had me worried
for some time, a woman of that sort.

728
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:44,423
What sort is that, Mr. Beardsley?

729
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:47,508
I don't think any of us have any illusions
about her character, have we, Devlin?

730
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:49,552
Not at all, not the slightest.

731
00:51:49,593 --> 00:51:52,679
Miss Huberman is first, last,
and always not a lady.

732
00:51:52,721 --> 00:51:56,182
She may be risking her life,
but when it comes to being a lady,

733
00:51:56,224 --> 00:52:00,227
she doesn't hold a candle to your wife, sir,
sitting in Washington, playing bridge

734
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:02,730
with three other ladies
of great honor and virtue.

735
00:52:02,813 --> 00:52:04,731
- Take it easy, Dev.
- Sorry.

736
00:52:04,814 --> 00:52:07,483
I think those remarks about my wife
are uncalled for.

737
00:52:07,567 --> 00:52:09,568
Withdrawn. Apologize, sir.

738
00:52:14,864 --> 00:52:16,241
- How do you do, Miss Huberman?
- How do you do?

739
00:52:16,324 --> 00:52:19,327
This is Mr. Beardsley
and Señor Julio Barbosa.

740
00:52:19,910 --> 00:52:21,328
- Care to sit down?
- Thank you.

741
00:52:21,411 --> 00:52:23,580
You have the esteem
of my government, señorita.

742
00:52:23,663 --> 00:52:25,790
But we are worried
about you visiting this office.

743
00:52:25,874 --> 00:52:27,542
I promise not to break the rules again.

744
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:30,753
But I need some advice,
and I couldn't find Mr. Devlin.

745
00:52:30,836 --> 00:52:33,004
In fact, I need it before lunch.

746
00:52:33,087 --> 00:52:37,424
Has something happened?
- Yes, something rather confusing.

747
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:41,054
Mr. Sebastian has asked me to marry him.

748
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:42,929
What?
Well, well.

749
00:52:44,765 --> 00:52:49,101
He wants me to marry him right away,
and I'm to give him my answer at lunch.

750
00:52:49,184 --> 00:52:52,729
I didn't know what the department
might think about such a step.

751
00:52:52,812 --> 00:52:56,190
Are you willing
to go this far for us, Miss Huberman?

752
00:52:57,441 --> 00:52:59,068
Yes, if you wish.

753
00:53:00,653 --> 00:53:03,113
What do you think of this, Devlin?

754
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:05,864
I think it's a useful idea.

755
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:09,201
Well, you know the situation
better than any of us.

756
00:53:09,701 --> 00:53:13,121
May I ask what inspired
Alex Sebastian to go this far?

757
00:53:14,538 --> 00:53:16,415
He is in love with me.

758
00:53:17,333 --> 00:53:20,001
And he thinks you're in love with him?

759
00:53:22,004 --> 00:53:23,588
Yes, that's what he thinks.

760
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,257
Gentlemen,
it's the cream of the jest.

761
00:53:29,802 --> 00:53:33,137
Then... Then it's all right?

762
00:53:35,473 --> 00:53:37,392
Yes, I'd say so.

763
00:53:38,184 --> 00:53:41,687
Of course,
it's a perfect marriage for us.

764
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:44,230
There's only one thing,
won't it delay us a bit?

765
00:53:44,313 --> 00:53:45,940
What do you mean?

766
00:53:46,274 --> 00:53:49,902
Mr. Sebastian is a very romantic fellow,
isn't he, Alicia?

767
00:53:51,486 --> 00:53:52,570
Yes.

768
00:53:52,988 --> 00:53:56,449
Then he'll probably want to take
his bride away for a long honeymoon.

769
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:58,200
Won't that hold us up?

770
00:53:58,284 --> 00:54:00,244
Devlin's got a point there.
I don't know,

771
00:54:00,326 --> 00:54:03,414
I think we can rely on Miss Huberman
to get back into the house quickly.

772
00:54:05,623 --> 00:54:07,958
Yes, I think I can manage that.

773
00:54:09,377 --> 00:54:11,461
Everything seems to be nicely arranged.

774
00:54:11,503 --> 00:54:15,548
I don't think you need me here anymore,
do you, Captain Prescott?

775
00:54:16,007 --> 00:54:19,217
I do want to thank you,
Miss Huberman, very much.

776
00:54:19,718 --> 00:54:21,678
I think, so far,
everything has been managed

777
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,015
- with great intelligence.
Yes, thank you very much.

778
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:28,850
Are you quite sure
she didn't come down here to see you?

779
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:31,520
To capture the rich Alex Sebastian
for a husband?

780
00:54:31,603 --> 00:54:33,855
Don't be absurd, Mother,
she didn't even know I was here.

781
00:54:33,938 --> 00:54:38,359
- We will discuss it more fully tonight.
- We will not discuss it tonight.

782
00:54:44,238 --> 00:54:45,906
You know, all these carping questions

783
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,782
are merely the expression
of your own jealousy,

784
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,409
just as you've always been jealous
of any woman

785
00:54:49,492 --> 00:54:50,952
I've ever shown any interest in.

786
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:52,871
In this case,
there's nothing more to discuss.

787
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:56,415
You mean, then,
you are going ahead with this marriage?

788
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,544
I mean that the wedding
will be next week.

789
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:02,629
It'll be private.

790
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:07,215
We shall both be pleased
to have you present if you wish.

791
00:55:39,576 --> 00:55:42,787
- Good evening, sir, madame.
- Good evening, Joseph.

792
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:46,207
It doesn't look very cheerful here.

793
00:55:46,248 --> 00:55:49,585
I'm sorry, sir. Madame Sebastian
wasn't certain you'd be back tonight.

794
00:55:49,668 --> 00:55:51,211
Why not? I telegraphed her.

795
00:55:51,254 --> 00:55:54,422
Madame Sebastian said
we were all to retire, sir.

796
00:55:54,881 --> 00:55:56,049
Where is my mother?

797
00:55:56,091 --> 00:55:59,093
Madame Sebastian went to bed
very early, sir.

798
00:55:59,218 --> 00:56:02,220
I'm sorry, my dear. I'm afraid this isn't
a very bright homecoming for you.

799
00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:03,596
That's all right, Alex.

800
00:56:03,679 --> 00:56:06,515
Well, what shall we do? Shall we have
Joseph arrange for food for us?

801
00:56:06,598 --> 00:56:09,142
Not unless you want to.
I'm rather tired myself.

802
00:56:09,226 --> 00:56:11,061
We'll go right up, then.

803
00:56:11,103 --> 00:56:13,104
- Good night.
- Good night.

804
00:56:17,566 --> 00:56:19,943
I'd like to have all my dresses
put out on the bed here.

805
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:22,153
Don't hang anything up,
I like to know where everything goes.

806
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:25,699
- Joseph, did you have the closets aired?
- Yes, madame.

807
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:34,872
This isn't very large. I'll need more room.

808
00:56:44,505 --> 00:56:45,755
This door is locked.

809
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:48,301
That's used for a storeroom, madame.

810
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:51,886
- May I have the key?
- I do not have the keys, madame.

811
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:53,179
Where are they?

812
00:56:53,262 --> 00:56:56,932
Madame Sebastian has charge
of all the house keys, madame.

813
00:56:57,725 --> 00:56:58,725
Oh.

814
00:57:00,102 --> 00:57:02,145
Do you know where Mr. Sebastian is?

815
00:57:02,228 --> 00:57:06,231
I believe he is having a business meeting
downstairs in the study, madame.

816
00:57:08,442 --> 00:57:09,901
I miss Hupka.

817
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:12,778
He was a first-class metallurgist.

818
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,822
Gleichen is just as good.

819
00:57:14,906 --> 00:57:16,699
Such is your opinion.

820
00:57:16,824 --> 00:57:20,161
But I don't want to criticize.
What were you asking?

821
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:23,204
You want a report, a written report.

822
00:57:23,662 --> 00:57:26,999
Well, my friends, my work is done.

823
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:31,294
- You've been successful?
- Yes.

824
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:41,011
- I'm very sorry. I...
- Not at all.

825
00:57:41,218 --> 00:57:42,721
- Come on in.
- No. I'm sorry to interrupt you.

826
00:57:42,804 --> 00:57:44,013
I didn't know you were busy.

827
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:47,807
Some of the closets are locked.
Could you give me the keys?

828
00:57:48,142 --> 00:57:50,185
I'm so sorry. I'd forgotten about the keys.

829
00:57:50,268 --> 00:57:53,062
Of course, I'll get them for you at once.

830
00:58:00,193 --> 00:58:03,279
I'll bring the keys to you
right away, my dear.

831
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,033
Mother? Mother?

832
00:58:07,616 --> 00:58:08,825
Come in.

833
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:14,663
Mother, Alicia wants the closet keys.

834
00:58:18,166 --> 00:58:20,335
Mother, stop arguing! Give me those keys!

835
00:58:20,377 --> 00:58:21,752
I will not!

836
00:58:23,295 --> 00:58:25,547
Mother, will you please give me the keys?

837
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,467
Thank you.

838
00:58:39,433 --> 00:58:41,018
There they are.

839
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,187
Afraid I'm going to be busy the rest
of the morning, my dear.

840
00:58:43,229 --> 00:58:44,397
See you at lunch.

841
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,107
Thank you, dear.

842
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:05,622
Mr. Sebastian has the key for this,
madame. It's the wine cellar.

843
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:22,971
Then the wine cellar's
the obvious place to look.

844
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:25,890
Alex has the key to that.

845
00:59:25,931 --> 00:59:27,725
Then get it from him.

846
00:59:27,766 --> 00:59:29,393
Get it? How?

847
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:32,269
Don't you live near him?

848
00:59:34,521 --> 00:59:36,440
What do I look for if I get the key?

849
00:59:36,482 --> 00:59:37,648
You look for a bottle of wine,

850
00:59:37,733 --> 00:59:40,777
like the one that rattled
the fellow at dinner that night.

851
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,154
All the bottles look alike to me.
I'm no mastermind.

852
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:47,115
You're doing all right.

853
00:59:49,576 --> 00:59:51,201
It's no fun, Dev.

854
00:59:53,412 --> 00:59:55,789
Too late for that now, isn't it?

855
00:59:56,874 --> 01:00:00,835
Look, why don't you persuade
your husband to throw a large shindig,

856
01:00:00,919 --> 01:00:04,671
so he can introduce his bride
to Rio society, say sometime next week?

857
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:05,881
Why?

858
01:00:05,964 --> 01:00:07,798
Consider me invited,

859
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,470
and I'll try and find out
about that wine cellar business.

860
01:00:13,596 --> 01:00:17,599
I don't think my husband is interested
in entertaining just yet.

861
01:00:18,183 --> 01:00:20,393
The honeymoon isn't over, huh?

862
01:00:22,311 --> 01:00:26,398
Don't underestimate your charms,
Mrs. Sebastian. You can handle it.

863
01:00:26,482 --> 01:00:28,316
I don't think it's going to be
so easy about you.

864
01:00:28,399 --> 01:00:30,777
He thinks you're in love with me.

865
01:00:30,818 --> 01:00:32,987
Tell him you thought
if you invited me to the house,

866
01:00:33,071 --> 01:00:36,114
and I saw how happily married you were,

867
01:00:36,198 --> 01:00:40,117
then the horrid passion I have for you
might be torn out of me.

868
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,786
That sounds very logical.

869
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,456
Good, next week, then. And get the key.

870
01:00:45,539 --> 01:00:48,917
I have to fly up to Berlin,
but I'll be back in time.

871
01:00:50,252 --> 01:00:53,504
All right. I'll be looking forward
to seeing you.

872
01:00:53,547 --> 01:00:56,422
It's always a pleasure
meeting you, madame.

873
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:35,664
I'm surprised
at Mr. Devlin coming tonight.

874
01:01:35,747 --> 01:01:39,083
I don't blame anyone
for being in love with you, darling.

875
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,835
I just hope that

876
01:01:40,918 --> 01:01:43,879
nothing will happen to give him
any false impressions.

877
01:01:44,088 --> 01:01:46,299
I'll be with you in a minute.

878
01:01:56,306 --> 01:01:57,515
Darling.

879
01:02:01,394 --> 01:02:03,896
It's not that I don't trust you,
but when you're in love at my age,

880
01:02:03,979 --> 01:02:06,231
every man who looks at your woman
is a menace.

881
01:02:06,314 --> 01:02:08,942
Forgive me for even talking about it.

882
01:02:09,067 --> 01:02:10,401
I'm very contrite.

883
01:03:09,784 --> 01:03:13,079
Well, I think we might join
the rest of the party now.

884
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:15,455
I think all our guests are here.

885
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,922
Where can I find Madame Sebastian?

886
01:03:24,963 --> 01:03:27,799
- Go right in the drawing room, sir.
- Thank you.

887
01:03:44,438 --> 01:03:46,773
- Hello, Dev.
- Good evening.

888
01:03:55,155 --> 01:03:56,823
You haven't seen the house, have you?

889
01:03:56,906 --> 01:03:58,575
No, it's quite a jolly little cottage.

890
01:03:58,658 --> 01:04:00,701
Let me show you around the place.

891
01:04:00,784 --> 01:04:03,162
Later. His nibs is on the trail.

892
01:04:05,873 --> 01:04:08,042
- Mr. Devlin. Glad to see you.
- Good evening.

893
01:04:08,124 --> 01:04:10,043
It's kind of your bride to invite me.

894
01:04:10,126 --> 01:04:11,877
We both invite you, Mr. Devlin.

895
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:14,713
You will see that our guest is fed,
my dear, and amused.

896
01:04:14,796 --> 01:04:16,756
You know... Excuse me.

897
01:04:17,923 --> 01:04:20,634
Madame Estorik, I'm so glad to see you.

898
01:04:23,596 --> 01:04:26,514
- This isn't going to be easy.
- Why?

899
01:04:27,223 --> 01:04:30,934
He's quite sensitive about you.
He's going to watch us like a hawk.

900
01:04:31,018 --> 01:04:33,771
Yes, he's rather jealous of anyone who...

901
01:04:33,854 --> 01:04:36,814
- Where'd you get the key, off his chain?
- Yes.

902
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:42,110
Let's hope the liquor doesn't run out
and start him down the cellar for more.

903
01:04:42,194 --> 01:04:43,904
I hadn't thought about that.

904
01:04:43,987 --> 01:04:45,489
Quite a point.

905
01:04:49,534 --> 01:04:50,868
Thank you.

906
01:04:51,118 --> 01:04:54,037
- Mr. Devlin, how nice. You remember me?
- Señora Ortiz.

907
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,790
How sweet.
Young men usually have short memories.

908
01:04:56,873 --> 01:04:59,375
Here's something I adore, champagne.

909
01:05:00,168 --> 01:05:01,336
May I?

910
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:11,427
- Joseph.
- Madame?

911
01:05:11,511 --> 01:05:14,805
Do you think you have enough champagne
to last for the rest of the evening?

912
01:05:14,887 --> 01:05:17,223
I don't know, madame. I hope so.

913
01:05:34,904 --> 01:05:37,240
- Enjoying yourself, Mr. Devlin?
- Very much, thank you.

914
01:05:37,323 --> 01:05:40,200
There are so many things
I would like to ask about the States.

915
01:05:40,242 --> 01:05:42,160
I haven't heard anything for a long time.

916
01:05:42,245 --> 01:05:43,453
I'll be glad to tell you.

917
01:05:43,537 --> 01:05:46,415
- Will you excuse me, Señora Ortiz?
- Would you mind?

918
01:06:01,927 --> 01:06:03,804
- We'd better hurry.
- Lots of time.

919
01:06:03,887 --> 01:06:07,056
No. Joseph might have to ask Alex
for more wine.

920
01:06:08,933 --> 01:06:11,101
He's running out faster than he thought.

921
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:14,938
I'm sorry to hear that. Is he watching?

922
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:17,648
Yes. You'd better go out
in the garden alone,

923
01:06:17,733 --> 01:06:21,735
wait around the back of the house for me,
and I'll show you the wine cellar door.

924
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:34,912
- Nice party, isn't it?
- It's a wonderful party.

925
01:06:34,955 --> 01:06:37,957
I think you've done it wonderfully well.
I'm very proud.

926
01:06:37,999 --> 01:06:39,417
Mr. Devlin bothering you much?

927
01:06:39,459 --> 01:06:42,210
No, darling.
He's trying to drown his sorrow.

928
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,665
Excuse me. I think I'll ask the orchestra
to play some Brazilian music.

929
01:07:26,748 --> 01:07:30,167
- They've played waltzes all evening.
- All right, dear.

930
01:07:51,018 --> 01:07:53,187
- That's the door.
- All right.

931
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:01,193
I'll keep the garden door open
and I'll tell you if anything happens.

932
01:09:05,038 --> 01:09:06,622
What's happened?

933
01:09:08,541 --> 01:09:10,334
Look, vintage sand.

934
01:09:13,879 --> 01:09:15,880
We've got to leave things
as we found them.

935
01:09:15,963 --> 01:09:18,215
Help me find a bottle of wine,
with the same label as these others.

936
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:22,636
- It isn't really sand, is it?
- No, I think it's some kind of metal ore.

937
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:40,776
This is a bit weird.
- I'm terrified.

938
01:09:40,859 --> 01:09:43,778
Just pretend you're a janitor.
Janitors are never terrified.

939
01:09:43,819 --> 01:09:45,781
I have a feeling we're very slow.

940
01:09:45,864 --> 01:09:47,406
We're on schedule. Take it easy.

941
01:09:47,490 --> 01:09:49,783
I keep hearing someone coming.

942
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,744
That'll be nice.

943
01:09:52,661 --> 01:09:55,956
- Think, if he comes down with Joseph.
- Unfortunate.

944
01:10:27,481 --> 01:10:29,108
Someone is coming.

945
01:10:29,775 --> 01:10:31,276
Alex, he's seen us.

946
01:10:31,402 --> 01:10:33,319
Wait a minute, I'm going to kiss you.

947
01:10:33,403 --> 01:10:36,447
- No, he'll only think...
- That's what I want him to think.

948
01:10:41,743 --> 01:10:44,079
You'd better stay upstairs, Joseph.
They may need you.

949
01:10:44,120 --> 01:10:45,413
Yes, sir.

950
01:10:51,085 --> 01:10:52,669
Oh, Dev, Dev.

951
01:11:02,051 --> 01:11:03,511
Push me away.

952
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:10,267
I'm sorry to intrude on this tender scene.

953
01:11:10,309 --> 01:11:13,604
I couldn't help what happened.
He's been drinking.

954
01:11:14,020 --> 01:11:15,896
So he carried you down here?

955
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,440
Please, Alex.

956
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:19,567
You love him.

957
01:11:19,649 --> 01:11:21,610
No. Of course not. Please go.

958
01:11:21,693 --> 01:11:24,904
For what it's worth, as an apology,
your wife is telling the truth.

959
01:11:24,946 --> 01:11:27,239
I knew her before you,
loved her before you,

960
01:11:27,281 --> 01:11:29,158
but I wasn't as lucky as you.

961
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:30,409
Sorry, Alicia.

962
01:11:30,491 --> 01:11:32,410
- Please go.
- Good night.

963
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,584
Alex, don't be foolish.

964
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:43,586
I came down here because he threatened
to make a scene unless I'd see him alone.

965
01:11:43,628 --> 01:11:44,837
He kissed you.

966
01:11:44,922 --> 01:11:47,423
I couldn't stop him. I tried.

967
01:11:47,506 --> 01:11:49,591
We'll talk about it later.

968
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:52,260
Your guests are upstairs.

969
01:11:53,135 --> 01:11:55,262
Will you please go to them?

970
01:12:02,936 --> 01:12:05,604
Mr. Devlin, are you going so soon?

971
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:07,981
Yes, I'm afraid I have to be up
early in the morning.

972
01:12:08,066 --> 01:12:10,108
Thank you and good night.

973
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:15,905
Joseph.
- Yes, sir?

974
01:12:15,988 --> 01:12:18,824
- We'll go down for the wine now.
- Yes, sir.

975
01:12:41,385 --> 01:12:43,011
You know, Joseph,

976
01:12:43,719 --> 01:12:46,347
I don't think we need
give them any more champagne.

977
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:49,766
- We still have some upstairs, haven't we?
- Yes, sir.

978
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:52,644
And some whiskey and wine?

979
01:12:52,686 --> 01:12:55,813
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I think we'll give them that.

980
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:09,283
I'm sorry about what happened, Alex.

981
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:13,953
My dear, I shall never forgive myself
for behaving like a stupid schoolboy.

982
01:13:15,955 --> 01:13:16,956
Then you believe me?

983
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:19,250
Of course. It isn't worth mentioning again.

984
01:13:19,332 --> 01:13:21,918
Thank you. Are you coming up?

985
01:13:22,001 --> 01:13:25,672
Not for a little while. Dr. Anderson's
waiting for me in the study.

986
01:13:25,714 --> 01:13:29,425
Sleep well. It was a very successful party.

987
01:13:30,717 --> 01:13:32,468
- Good night, then.
- Good night.

988
01:13:32,552 --> 01:13:34,554
Thanks for being so nice.

989
01:17:00,766 --> 01:17:01,975
Mother.

990
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,063
Mother.

991
01:17:14,654 --> 01:17:16,655
Why are you up so early?

992
01:17:18,572 --> 01:17:20,199
I need your help.

993
01:17:21,034 --> 01:17:22,744
Something is wrong?

994
01:17:23,910 --> 01:17:26,704
A great deal. Alicia.

995
01:17:30,875 --> 01:17:32,584
I have expected it.

996
01:17:33,252 --> 01:17:34,795
I knew. I knew.

997
01:17:35,753 --> 01:17:37,089
What is it?

998
01:17:37,505 --> 01:17:38,882
Mr. Devlin?

999
01:17:40,091 --> 01:17:41,092
No.

1000
01:17:46,263 --> 01:17:48,722
I am married to an American agent.

1001
01:18:18,206 --> 01:18:21,792
Yes. It is easy to see now.

1002
01:18:22,793 --> 01:18:24,794
I knew, but I didn't see.

1003
01:18:25,378 --> 01:18:27,171
They picked her because of her father.

1004
01:18:27,255 --> 01:18:30,008
I must have been insane, mad,

1005
01:18:30,091 --> 01:18:33,719
behaved like an idiot,
to believe in her with her clinging kisses.

1006
01:18:33,802 --> 01:18:35,929
Stop wallowing in your foul memories.

1007
01:18:36,013 --> 01:18:37,763
Well, what do I do?

1008
01:18:38,264 --> 01:18:41,142
There's nothing to do. I'm done, finished.

1009
01:18:44,103 --> 01:18:45,979
- They'll find out.
- They won't find out.

1010
01:18:46,021 --> 01:18:47,522
They'll find out what I'm married to.

1011
01:18:47,606 --> 01:18:50,649
Look what they did to Emil Hupka.
Emil who did nothing.

1012
01:18:50,733 --> 01:18:54,485
And I've betrayed them, I've bungled,
and there's no excuse.

1013
01:18:55,778 --> 01:18:58,656
I'd do the same myself,
kill the fool who betrayed them.

1014
01:18:58,739 --> 01:19:01,910
- There's no need for them to find out.
- Mathis is very sharp.

1015
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:05,120
Yes. He dislikes you. But his criticism
of your talents wouldn't go

1016
01:19:05,203 --> 01:19:09,081
that far to imagine that you are married
to an American agent.

1017
01:19:09,165 --> 01:19:13,628
We are protected by the enormity
of your stupidity for a time.

1018
01:19:13,711 --> 01:19:17,005
- Alicia, I'll take care of her myself.
- No, not that way.

1019
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:19,674
I stood looking at her
when she was asleep.

1020
01:19:19,757 --> 01:19:22,676
- I could have...
- Quiet, Alex.

1021
01:19:25,178 --> 01:19:28,139
You're almost as impetuous
as before your wedding.

1022
01:19:28,181 --> 01:19:30,599
You barred me from that episode.

1023
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:32,726
Let me arrange this one.

1024
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:36,188
Listen to me,
no one must know what she is.

1025
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:39,941
There must be no suspicion of her,
of you, or me.

1026
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:46,071
She must be allowed to move about freely,
but she will be on a leash.

1027
01:19:46,196 --> 01:19:49,073
She will learn nothing further to inform.

1028
01:19:50,367 --> 01:19:54,161
She must go, but it must happen slowly.

1029
01:19:54,786 --> 01:20:00,290
If she could become ill
and remain ill for a time until...

1030
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:12,260
Drink your coffee, darling, it's getting cold.

1031
01:20:12,343 --> 01:20:14,219
Are you going out this afternoon, Alex?

1032
01:20:14,302 --> 01:20:18,472
No, my dear, I have some letters to write.
What are you going to do?

1033
01:20:18,556 --> 01:20:20,683
I just have a little shopping.

1034
01:20:20,766 --> 01:20:23,977
I'd like to go to the Imperiale
and maybe I'll go to Cosmos and see

1035
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:25,896
if they have any new books in
from New York.

1036
01:20:25,980 --> 01:20:27,021
If you're going down there,

1037
01:20:27,064 --> 01:20:29,982
will you go to Suzette Crew's
to see if my cigars have arrived?

1038
01:20:30,066 --> 01:20:31,441
Should be about 1,000 of them.

1039
01:20:31,525 --> 01:20:34,694
If they have, ask them to keep them
in the humidor for me, will you?

1040
01:20:39,156 --> 01:20:42,450
Anything wrong?
- No. The light bothers me.

1041
01:20:42,742 --> 01:20:44,911
I have a bit of a headache.
Would you mind...

1042
01:20:44,995 --> 01:20:47,831
- Yes, I think we can fix that.
- Thank you.

1043
01:20:48,706 --> 01:20:52,959
You know, some people get too much sun
down here. You must be careful.

1044
01:20:53,585 --> 01:20:57,838
I think you can be
very proud of yourself, Mrs. Sebastian.

1045
01:20:58,047 --> 01:21:01,300
That sand that Devlin brought in
shows uranium ore.

1046
01:21:01,467 --> 01:21:03,510
So now we know what we're driving at.

1047
01:21:03,594 --> 01:21:08,389
Your job from now on will be to try to help
us find out where that sand comes from.

1048
01:21:08,431 --> 01:21:11,559
The location of the uranium deposit
is of vast importance,

1049
01:21:11,642 --> 01:21:13,643
and we're putting quite a few people on it.

1050
01:21:13,727 --> 01:21:16,313
But I think you'll be of great help.

1051
01:21:16,396 --> 01:21:17,480
All right.

1052
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:20,733
But that isn't the main reason why
I asked you to come here this afternoon.

1053
01:21:20,774 --> 01:21:23,402
- No?
- No, I wanted to tell you that

1054
01:21:23,776 --> 01:21:26,904
I'm going to change your contact
in about a week.

1055
01:21:26,946 --> 01:21:29,656
Mr. Devlin's been transferred to Spain.

1056
01:21:30,617 --> 01:21:31,950
To Spain?

1057
01:21:32,868 --> 01:21:34,452
Does Mr. Devlin know that?

1058
01:21:34,535 --> 01:21:37,580
- Yes. He asked for the transfer.
- Why?

1059
01:21:37,664 --> 01:21:40,415
Well, I guess he thought
he was going stale here.

1060
01:21:40,457 --> 01:21:42,083
He wants to leave Rio?

1061
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:46,378
Yes. I guess he thought
he'd find Spain more interesting.

1062
01:21:46,462 --> 01:21:48,756
Yes, I imagine it would be.

1063
01:21:48,797 --> 01:21:50,132
There really isn't very much

1064
01:21:50,174 --> 01:21:53,468
for a brainy fellow like Mr. Devlin
to do in Rio anymore.

1065
01:21:53,551 --> 01:21:56,638
Well, of course,
it is more or less routine now.

1066
01:21:57,931 --> 01:22:01,808
In the meantime,
I'm to report to Mr. Devlin as usual?

1067
01:22:01,893 --> 01:22:04,937
Yes. He'll be here
until the new man arrives.

1068
01:22:05,562 --> 01:22:07,355
Thank you, Captain Prescott.

1069
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,899
I'll keep my ears wide open. Goodbye.

1070
01:22:09,982 --> 01:22:11,858
Goodbye. And...

1071
01:22:13,485 --> 01:22:14,860
Go easy on that sun.

1072
01:22:27,664 --> 01:22:29,414
Darling, what is it?

1073
01:22:29,665 --> 01:22:31,000
I don't know.

1074
01:22:31,166 --> 01:22:34,670
- Are you in pain?
- Yes, I'm so dizzy.

1075
01:22:35,419 --> 01:22:36,922
What happened to her?

1076
01:22:37,004 --> 01:22:39,048
We were walking
and she was stricken suddenly.

1077
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,634
I'll be all right. Let's go inside.

1078
01:23:03,652 --> 01:23:05,862
I'm sorry I couldn't make it on time.

1079
01:23:05,946 --> 01:23:08,990
It gets a bit Ionely
squatting on a bench all day.

1080
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:11,533
Yes, Rio can be a very dull town.

1081
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:13,618
What's new?

1082
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,453
Nothing. What's new with you?

1083
01:23:16,871 --> 01:23:18,122
Nothing.

1084
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:23,334
Any domestic troubles
about the other night?

1085
01:23:24,043 --> 01:23:25,086
No.

1086
01:23:25,253 --> 01:23:27,671
Any footprints in that sand, yet?

1087
01:23:28,213 --> 01:23:29,798
No, nothing yet.

1088
01:23:31,008 --> 01:23:33,009
Just a social visit?

1089
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:35,845
A little fresh air helps.

1090
01:23:36,637 --> 01:23:38,514
You don't look so hot.

1091
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,434
- Well...
- Sick?

1092
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:45,978
No, hangover.

1093
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,484
That's news. Back to the bottle again?

1094
01:23:52,692 --> 01:23:55,445
It sort of lightens my chores.

1095
01:23:56,321 --> 01:23:59,031
- Big party?
- Just the family circle.

1096
01:23:59,615 --> 01:24:01,532
Sounds quite jolly.

1097
01:24:01,574 --> 01:24:03,826
It helps life in a dull town.

1098
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:07,121
You ought to take it easy on that liquor.

1099
01:24:08,705 --> 01:24:12,876
Don't you find Rio
a little hard to take, too?

1100
01:24:14,711 --> 01:24:16,212
Not a bad town.

1101
01:24:18,088 --> 01:24:21,633
You look all mashed up.
Must have been quite an evening.

1102
01:24:21,716 --> 01:24:23,802
Yeah, it was.

1103
01:24:24,093 --> 01:24:27,263
Okay, if you want to play that way,
go on, have fun,

1104
01:24:27,347 --> 01:24:29,056
no reason why you shouldn't.

1105
01:24:29,139 --> 01:24:30,349
That's right, Dev.

1106
01:24:30,432 --> 01:24:34,018
Here's something that belongs to you.
I should have given it to you sooner.

1107
01:24:34,101 --> 01:24:35,478
What is it?

1108
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:38,271
A scarf that you lent me once in Miami.

1109
01:24:44,444 --> 01:24:46,238
Cleaning house?

1110
01:24:50,991 --> 01:24:52,492
Goodbye, Dev.

1111
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:56,246
What do you mean, goodbye?

1112
01:24:57,162 --> 01:24:59,039
Nothing. Just goodbye.

1113
01:25:00,374 --> 01:25:02,668
Fresh air isn't as good for a hangover
as I thought.

1114
01:25:02,751 --> 01:25:04,710
Sit down. You're still tight.

1115
01:25:04,794 --> 01:25:06,379
I don't want to.

1116
01:25:08,631 --> 01:25:10,383
Where are you going?

1117
01:25:10,799 --> 01:25:12,217
Back home.

1118
01:25:17,763 --> 01:25:20,724
You are not taking care of yourself, Alicia.

1119
01:25:20,932 --> 01:25:22,642
I feel much better.

1120
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,478
You look like something awful.

1121
01:25:27,105 --> 01:25:29,022
Circles under the eyes.

1122
01:25:31,483 --> 01:25:35,945
My dear child, you must have a doctor
find out what is the matter with you.

1123
01:25:36,028 --> 01:25:37,988
I never go near doctors.

1124
01:25:38,738 --> 01:25:41,783
They always want to cart you off
to a hospital.

1125
01:25:42,033 --> 01:25:44,369
Maybe you belong in a hospital.

1126
01:25:45,661 --> 01:25:49,790
Tell me, when did you first feel sick?

1127
01:25:52,584 --> 01:25:54,002
I don't remember.

1128
01:25:54,085 --> 01:25:56,629
Maybe the party, I think.

1129
01:25:57,087 --> 01:25:59,798
I still think a sea trip
would be much better for you, darling,

1130
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:01,508
than doctors and hospitals.

1131
01:26:01,592 --> 01:26:04,303
A little cruise somewhere. Maybe Spain?

1132
01:26:04,677 --> 01:26:06,971
Put the roses back in your cheeks,
my sweet.

1133
01:26:07,013 --> 01:26:09,306
I don't think so.
I don't care much for boats.

1134
01:26:09,347 --> 01:26:11,141
We could go together, my dear,

1135
01:26:11,183 --> 01:26:14,769
if you could bear to leave Alex behind
for a few weeks.

1136
01:26:14,852 --> 01:26:17,896
I think I prefer Alex
to a case of seasickness.

1137
01:26:19,982 --> 01:26:21,858
I always get seasick.

1138
01:26:23,193 --> 01:26:25,653
Then you might like the mountains.

1139
01:26:27,029 --> 01:26:29,364
The air is fresh and pure.

1140
01:26:29,865 --> 01:26:31,449
I am going next week.

1141
01:26:31,532 --> 01:26:33,242
You're leaving?

1142
01:26:33,493 --> 01:26:35,495
I'm sorry. I'll miss you.

1143
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:38,997
Yes. I'm delaying my work too long.

1144
01:26:39,748 --> 01:26:43,418
If you come with me,
the mountains won't make you seasick.

1145
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:48,756
And the Aymores mountains are beautiful,
covered with flowers and...

1146
01:26:49,548 --> 01:26:52,926
What Alicia needs is rest,
not mountain climbing.

1147
01:26:53,009 --> 01:26:55,345
I have heard about the Aymores.

1148
01:26:55,553 --> 01:26:57,180
Did you? Really?

1149
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:00,682
Yes.

1150
01:27:00,724 --> 01:27:05,520
The beautiful little native towns,
tell me, are you going to Leopoldina?

1151
01:27:05,603 --> 01:27:09,815
- No, no. I am going to Santa...
- Care for some more brandy, Otto?

1152
01:27:10,315 --> 01:27:11,983
No, no, thank you.

1153
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:16,362
I never drink more than one brandy,
and even this is sometimes too much.

1154
01:27:16,403 --> 01:27:18,279
I'll just finish my coffee.

1155
01:27:18,363 --> 01:27:20,490
- No, that is...
- But that's Alicia's...

1156
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:23,117
Oh, I'm sorry.

1157
01:27:24,243 --> 01:27:27,246
Perhaps Alex is right, my dear child.

1158
01:27:27,830 --> 01:27:30,748
When you are young,
rest is the best doctor.

1159
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:37,547
And if you lie still for a few days,
reading, relaxing,

1160
01:27:37,796 --> 01:27:42,342
forgetting all your troubles,
it might be as well as medicine or sea air.

1161
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:47,805
When I come back, you will be all well,
making us all very happy once more.

1162
01:27:53,225 --> 01:27:56,687
Excuse me. I want to go to bed, I think.

1163
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:58,439
Pain again, darling?

1164
01:27:58,522 --> 01:28:00,440
I'm sorry to complain.

1165
01:28:02,442 --> 01:28:04,902
Shall I take you up to your room?

1166
01:28:05,152 --> 01:28:08,697
May I help
you, my dear, some hot water, maybe?

1167
01:28:12,283 --> 01:28:14,703
No, please, don't bother.

1168
01:28:16,537 --> 01:28:18,163
I'll be all right.

1169
01:28:18,247 --> 01:28:21,750
If you don't feel better in
the morning, I insist you call a doctor.

1170
01:28:21,790 --> 01:28:24,419
I don't like
the way she looks, Alex.

1171
01:28:24,461 --> 01:28:26,336
I'm worried about her.

1172
01:28:57,654 --> 01:28:58,739
Alicia?

1173
01:28:58,822 --> 01:29:00,365
Joseph, help me lift her.

1174
01:29:00,449 --> 01:29:02,617
We must take her up to bed.

1175
01:29:03,576 --> 01:29:05,078
Come, my dear.

1176
01:29:12,666 --> 01:29:14,627
I told you she is sick.

1177
01:29:15,044 --> 01:29:16,836
Don't exert yourself.

1178
01:29:17,171 --> 01:29:18,421
Be quiet.

1179
01:29:19,547 --> 01:29:21,674
No. Go! Go away!

1180
01:29:21,758 --> 01:29:22,967
No!

1181
01:29:34,352 --> 01:29:35,727
No, I don't want to.

1182
01:29:35,811 --> 01:29:39,106
Some sort of spasm.
I'm sure it's not serious.

1183
01:29:39,189 --> 01:29:40,981
We must get a doctor.

1184
01:29:41,023 --> 01:29:42,983
The poor child is suffering too much.

1185
01:29:43,026 --> 01:29:45,528
I'll call the hospital. I'll get Dr. De Sa.

1186
01:29:45,569 --> 01:29:48,154
Don't worry, dear Otto. We'll get a doctor.

1187
01:29:48,196 --> 01:29:51,157
A good one.
We'll take the best care of her.

1188
01:29:54,369 --> 01:29:56,954
Joseph, disconnect the telephone.

1189
01:29:57,079 --> 01:29:59,455
Madame must have absolute quiet.

1190
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,999
Take it out of the room, Joseph.

1191
01:30:29,356 --> 01:30:30,773
Five days, eh?

1192
01:30:30,857 --> 01:30:33,025
Say, that must be quite a binge she's on.

1193
01:30:33,109 --> 01:30:34,736
I don't think so.

1194
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:38,238
Well, you said she was drinking last week,
drunk when you saw her.

1195
01:30:38,321 --> 01:30:41,532
- Yes, but I've had time to think it over.
- Think what over?

1196
01:30:41,615 --> 01:30:44,535
That drinking of hers, I don't believe it.

1197
01:30:44,617 --> 01:30:47,037
Why should she lie to you about that?

1198
01:30:47,079 --> 01:30:49,914
Don't know.
She wasn't drunk, she was sick.

1199
01:30:50,582 --> 01:30:52,459
Maybe that's why she hasn't shown up.

1200
01:30:52,542 --> 01:30:54,252
She looked like
the ragged end of nowhere.

1201
01:30:54,334 --> 01:30:56,211
Well, still sounds like a hangover to me.

1202
01:30:56,295 --> 01:30:57,880
Yes. I'm going to pay a call.

1203
01:30:57,963 --> 01:31:00,716
Wait a minute,
I don't want you to mess things up.

1204
01:31:00,757 --> 01:31:02,883
We hope to close this case out
in a few days.

1205
01:31:02,966 --> 01:31:05,802
I won't mess anything up.
Just a social call.

1206
01:31:05,886 --> 01:31:07,471
I'm a friend of the family.

1207
01:31:07,554 --> 01:31:10,807
All right, go ahead if you want to.
But don't take any chances.

1208
01:31:11,015 --> 01:31:13,434
And call me up when you get back.

1209
01:31:13,476 --> 01:31:15,269
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

1210
01:31:41,457 --> 01:31:42,583
Good evening, sir.

1211
01:31:42,666 --> 01:31:44,752
Good evening. Family home tonight?

1212
01:31:44,835 --> 01:31:46,002
Yes, sir.

1213
01:31:46,086 --> 01:31:49,881
Would you mind telling Mr. Sebastian
that Mr. Devlin is here?

1214
01:31:50,799 --> 01:31:53,342
- What is it, Joseph?
- I'm very sorry, sir,

1215
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:56,928
but since Mr. Sebastian asked me
not to disturb him, I don't know...

1216
01:31:56,970 --> 01:31:58,096
Asleep?

1217
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:01,182
No, sir. He's in the study
with some business associates.

1218
01:32:01,265 --> 01:32:04,143
- How long do you think he'll be tied up?
- I don't know, sir.

1219
01:32:04,185 --> 01:32:05,811
Mrs. Sebastian home?

1220
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:08,480
- Yes, sir.
- Would you mind telling her?

1221
01:32:08,563 --> 01:32:10,649
- I'm afraid I can't, sir.
- Why not?

1222
01:32:10,732 --> 01:32:14,025
Mrs. Sebastian is very ill
and confined to her bed.

1223
01:32:15,860 --> 01:32:18,071
I'm sorry to hear that.
How long has she been ill?

1224
01:32:18,154 --> 01:32:19,322
A week.

1225
01:32:19,489 --> 01:32:21,491
- Has she had a doctor?
- I think so, sir.

1226
01:32:21,573 --> 01:32:24,159
We are all very concerned about her.

1227
01:32:24,660 --> 01:32:27,955
If you will wait here, Mr. Devlin,
I'll tell Mr. Sebastian.

1228
01:32:27,996 --> 01:32:29,205
Right.

1229
01:32:36,962 --> 01:32:39,338
- Excuse me, sir.
- What is it, Joseph?

1230
01:32:39,380 --> 01:32:41,215
Mr. Devlin to see you, sir.

1231
01:32:41,298 --> 01:32:42,299
Oh.

1232
01:32:43,384 --> 01:32:45,260
Tell him I'll be with him in a minute,
will you?

1233
01:32:45,343 --> 01:32:46,594
Yes, sir.

1234
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:51,683
Go on, Professor.
This sounds serious to me.

1235
01:32:51,765 --> 01:32:53,016
To me, also.

1236
01:32:53,100 --> 01:32:54,810
What happened Monday?

1237
01:32:54,893 --> 01:32:56,270
Same thing.

1238
01:32:56,686 --> 01:32:59,605
When I left the bank,
a man was following me.

1239
01:32:59,689 --> 01:33:03,316
But this morning
when I went to the ticket office,

1240
01:33:03,359 --> 01:33:06,028
the same man came inside
and stood beside me.

1241
01:34:12,917 --> 01:34:15,043
Alicia. Alicia.

1242
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:26,552
- Alicia, what's wrong with you?
- I'm so glad you came.

1243
01:34:29,222 --> 01:34:30,473
I had to.

1244
01:34:30,807 --> 01:34:34,685
I couldn't stand any more
waiting and worrying about you.

1245
01:34:35,977 --> 01:34:38,604
That wasn't a hangover you had that day.

1246
01:34:38,688 --> 01:34:40,398
You were sick then.

1247
01:34:40,439 --> 01:34:43,651
- What is it?
- Yes, I was sick then.

1248
01:34:45,277 --> 01:34:47,529
What's wrong with you, Alicia?

1249
01:34:47,696 --> 01:34:48,905
Oh, Dev.

1250
01:34:49,614 --> 01:34:52,324
What is it, dear? What's wrong with you?

1251
01:34:53,784 --> 01:34:55,619
They're poisoning me.

1252
01:34:55,660 --> 01:34:58,538
I couldn't get away from them.

1253
01:34:58,621 --> 01:35:00,580
I tried, but I was too weak.

1254
01:35:00,664 --> 01:35:01,916
How long?

1255
01:35:03,917 --> 01:35:05,502
Since the party.

1256
01:35:06,460 --> 01:35:08,754
Alex and his mother found out.

1257
01:35:13,342 --> 01:35:15,301
Come on. Try and sit up.

1258
01:35:15,677 --> 01:35:16,928
Sit up.

1259
01:35:17,012 --> 01:35:18,929
I've got to get you out of here.

1260
01:35:19,054 --> 01:35:20,973
I thought you had gone.

1261
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:24,643
No, I had to see you once
and speak my piece.

1262
01:35:25,185 --> 01:35:27,729
I was getting out because I love you.

1263
01:35:27,812 --> 01:35:30,731
I couldn't bear seeing you
and him together.

1264
01:35:37,446 --> 01:35:38,821
You love me.

1265
01:35:39,739 --> 01:35:42,032
Why didn't you tell me before?

1266
01:35:42,450 --> 01:35:43,616
I know.

1267
01:35:44,076 --> 01:35:46,995
I couldn't see straight or think straight.

1268
01:35:48,246 --> 01:35:50,789
I was a fatheaded guy, full of pain.

1269
01:35:52,166 --> 01:35:54,417
It tore me up not having you.

1270
01:35:56,836 --> 01:35:58,463
You love me.

1271
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,299
You love me.

1272
01:36:01,715 --> 01:36:04,633
Long ago, all the time,
since the beginning.

1273
01:36:09,055 --> 01:36:11,015
Here, put on your robe.

1274
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:13,850
Come on.

1275
01:36:15,185 --> 01:36:16,644
Try to sit up.

1276
01:36:19,647 --> 01:36:22,900
Dev, I'm afraid I can't make it.

1277
01:36:22,982 --> 01:36:25,444
They gave me pills to sleep.

1278
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:28,780
Keep awake. Keep talking.

1279
01:36:30,323 --> 01:36:32,991
- Have you got a coat?
- In the closet.

1280
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:36,661
They didn't want the others
to know about me.

1281
01:36:43,541 --> 01:36:45,002
Keep talking.

1282
01:36:49,880 --> 01:36:51,674
Go on. What happened?

1283
01:36:52,257 --> 01:36:54,967
- What happened?
- Alex found out.

1284
01:36:55,385 --> 01:36:58,971
- And the others haven't?
- They'd kill him if they knew.

1285
01:37:00,305 --> 01:37:01,932
They killed Emil.

1286
01:37:02,891 --> 01:37:04,393
Are you in pain?

1287
01:37:04,433 --> 01:37:06,353
I don't know. The pills...

1288
01:37:06,561 --> 01:37:08,188
Give me your feet.

1289
01:37:10,606 --> 01:37:13,025
Say it again. It keeps me awake.

1290
01:37:13,692 --> 01:37:15,068
I love you.

1291
01:37:16,444 --> 01:37:18,196
Stand up.

1292
01:37:19,406 --> 01:37:21,323
Come on, wake up! Talk!

1293
01:37:22,366 --> 01:37:23,866
Dr. Anderson...

1294
01:37:25,493 --> 01:37:27,495
Go on. Go on, walk. Talk.

1295
01:37:27,578 --> 01:37:31,665
The sand comes
from the Aymores mountains.

1296
01:37:32,417 --> 01:37:33,834
We'll find it.

1297
01:37:34,166 --> 01:37:36,836
Near a town, Santa Ma something.

1298
01:37:37,254 --> 01:37:39,338
Good girl. We'll take care of it later.

1299
01:37:39,422 --> 01:37:41,465
- Come on. Keep awake. Keep walking.
- I'm afraid.

1300
01:37:41,549 --> 01:37:45,260
Dev, I'm afraid. They're all in the house.
We can't make it.

1301
01:37:52,766 --> 01:37:54,559
Don't ever leave me.

1302
01:37:54,851 --> 01:37:57,269
You'll never get rid of me again.

1303
01:37:58,271 --> 01:37:59,897
I never tried to.

1304
01:38:01,273 --> 01:38:03,232
Brace up. Here he comes.

1305
01:38:08,904 --> 01:38:11,406
What are you doing, Alicia?
What is this, Mr. Devlin?

1306
01:38:11,489 --> 01:38:14,451
I'm taking her to the hospital
to get the poison out of her.

1307
01:38:14,491 --> 01:38:15,535
Poison?

1308
01:38:15,617 --> 01:38:17,703
How would you like
your friends downstairs to know?

1309
01:38:17,786 --> 01:38:19,079
They've yet to be told.

1310
01:38:19,121 --> 01:38:20,914
- I'm taking her back to her room.
- No, Dev.

1311
01:38:20,955 --> 01:38:22,749
I'll raise quite a rumpus if you try.

1312
01:38:22,833 --> 01:38:27,086
- Alex, he knows?
- Yes.

1313
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:29,129
What is happening, Alex?

1314
01:38:31,090 --> 01:38:32,256
Alicia.

1315
01:38:32,341 --> 01:38:34,050
She's worse?
Yes.

1316
01:38:34,885 --> 01:38:37,595
All right, dear, we're going. We're going.

1317
01:38:37,678 --> 01:38:41,681
You haven't forgotten what they did
to Emil, have you, Sebastian?

1318
01:38:44,601 --> 01:38:46,102
Help him, Alex.

1319
01:38:46,935 --> 01:38:49,481
I'm glad you have a head on you, madame.

1320
01:38:49,563 --> 01:38:51,482
I'm not afraid to die.

1321
01:38:52,524 --> 01:38:56,277
You've got your chance, here and now.
Tell them who she is.

1322
01:38:57,278 --> 01:38:58,779
Need any help, Alex?

1323
01:38:59,821 --> 01:39:01,073
No, we can handle her.

1324
01:39:01,156 --> 01:39:03,158
Where are you taking her?

1325
01:39:04,993 --> 01:39:07,119
You answer that one, Sebastian.

1326
01:39:07,203 --> 01:39:08,788
To the hospital.

1327
01:39:08,829 --> 01:39:10,873
Alex, talk to them, quick!

1328
01:39:16,126 --> 01:39:18,004
I'm glad she's going.

1329
01:39:18,087 --> 01:39:20,923
You should not have waited so long, Alex.

1330
01:39:22,841 --> 01:39:25,385
Well, what am I going to do?
Start shooting?

1331
01:39:27,011 --> 01:39:29,513
Hold on, darling.
You've only got about 20 yards to go.

1332
01:39:29,596 --> 01:39:31,348
What happened, Alex?

1333
01:39:31,640 --> 01:39:32,640
Hmm?

1334
01:39:34,225 --> 01:39:35,811
Oh. Um...

1335
01:39:36,519 --> 01:39:38,061
She collapsed.

1336
01:39:38,645 --> 01:39:41,898
Mr. Devlin heard her scream
when he was waiting for me.

1337
01:39:41,982 --> 01:39:43,358
Come on, Alicia.

1338
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:45,986
Yes. I telephoned the hospital
as soon as I saw how she was.

1339
01:39:46,068 --> 01:39:48,028
- You have a car, Mr. Devlin?
- Out in front.

1340
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:49,196
Your hat, Alex.

1341
01:39:49,862 --> 01:39:53,616
- You are going with him, madame?
- No. Alex will call me up.

1342
01:39:54,367 --> 01:39:55,368
I'll wait here.

1343
01:39:55,451 --> 01:39:57,912
Call as soon as the doctor sees her.

1344
01:39:57,995 --> 01:39:59,371
Poor child.

1345
01:40:02,124 --> 01:40:04,835
- How do you feel?
- A bit dizzy.

1346
01:40:04,918 --> 01:40:06,335
Take some deep breaths.

1347
01:40:06,377 --> 01:40:07,878
Hurry. Hurry.

1348
01:40:18,721 --> 01:40:20,555
Now, just a minute,
I must sit with her.

1349
01:40:20,638 --> 01:40:21,848
No room, Sebastian.

1350
01:40:21,932 --> 01:40:24,310
- You must take me, they're watching me.
- That's your headache.

1351
01:40:24,392 --> 01:40:27,185
Please, take me! Please! Please!

1352
01:40:29,354 --> 01:40:32,816
There is no telephone in her room
to call the hospital.

1353
01:40:33,233 --> 01:40:35,693
Alex, will you come in, please?

1354
01:40:36,444 --> 01:40:38,361
I wish to talk to you.
