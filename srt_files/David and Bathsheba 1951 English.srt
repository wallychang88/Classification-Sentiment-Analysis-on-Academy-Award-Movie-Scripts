03:54:30,469 --> 03:54:33,427
You have never loved anyone
but yourself.

177
03:54:33,629 --> 03:54:36,985
"David," meaning "beloved."

178
03:54:37,189 --> 03:54:39,419
- David, the beloved-of-David.
- Whatever you say...

179
03:54:39,589 --> 03:54:42,740
My love was wasted.
You had no need of it.

180
03:54:45,589 --> 03:54:48,183
Is your memory so short?

181
03:54:49,069 --> 03:54:51,663
I had great need of it once.

182
03:54:51,869 --> 03:54:55,623
I begged you on my knees,
but you deserted me.

183
03:54:55,829 --> 03:54:58,423
You refused to follow me into exile.

184
03:54:58,789 --> 03:55:02,065
You even dishonored your vows
and let your father marry you to another.

185
03:55:02,229 --> 03:55:04,140
- Against my will.
- You can say so.

186
03:55:05,989 --> 03:55:10,346
But I cannot help thinking that real
love would have fathered a stronger will.

187
03:55:10,549 --> 03:55:12,540
Then why did you take me back?

188
03:55:13,789 --> 03:55:14,824
You might have guessed.

189
03:55:22,109 --> 03:55:23,906
Without Saul's daughter at my side...

190
03:55:24,069 --> 03:55:27,186
...the northern tribes would not have
acknowledged me as king.

By taking you back...

192
03:55:29,509 --> 03:55:31,977

DAVID:
Abishai.

201
03:57:55,869 --> 03:57:58,986
There is a house over there...

202
03:57:59,189 --> 03:58:01,578
...under that big terebinth tree.

203
03:58:01,789 --> 03:58:03,427
- You know it?
- Yes, sire.

204
03:58:03,629 --> 03:58:06,427
- The house of Uriah the Hittite.
- Uriah the Hittite.

205
03:58:06,629 --> 03:58:09,427
- He's a captain with the army.
- Yes, I know him.

206
03:58:09,829 --> 03:58:11,979
Does he, by any chance,
have a sister?

207
03:58:12,189 --> 03:58:14,305
No, sire. He has a wife.

208
03:58:14,509 --> 03:58:17,979
A Hebrew woman of Benjamin
called Bathsheba.

209
03:58:19,189 --> 03:58:21,066
Bathsheba.

210
03:58:22,109 --> 03:58:23,622
During my visit to the army...

211
03:58:23,789 --> 03:58:27,145
...this Uriah's gallantry was called
to my attention.

212
03:58:27,349 --> 03:58:30,546
It's been in my mind to reward him.

213
03:58:31,909 --> 03:58:35,982
Perhaps, in his absence,
his wife could accept the reward.

214
03:58:36,189 --> 03:58:39,659
- I'll send for the woman in the morning.
- No. Send for her now.

215
03:58:39,829 --> 03:58:42,297
She shall dine with me tonight.

216
03:58:43,229 --> 03:58:45,185
Yes, sire.

DAVID:
You're not eating.

218
03:58:50,949 --> 03:58:53,019
I dined earlier, sire.

219
03:58:53,189 --> 03:58:55,464
It is my custom when I am alone.

220
03:58:58,309 --> 03:59:00,743
As a soldier's wife,
you have good reason...

221
03:59:00,909 --> 03:59:03,981
...to hate the king who keeps
your husband from your side.

222
03:59:04,149 --> 03:59:05,707
The king does what he must.

223
03:59:05,869 --> 03:59:08,178
His needs are the kingdom's.

224
03:59:08,349 --> 03:59:10,180
Not all of them.

225
03:59:14,469 --> 03:59:16,061
This wine is Phoenician.

226
03:59:16,269 --> 03:59:20,581
I find it mellower than ours.
It has the blandness of the sea air.

227
03:59:20,949 --> 03:59:24,385
Have you ever visited the coast?

228
03:59:24,589 --> 03:59:25,578
No, sire.

229
03:59:25,789 --> 03:59:27,984
I lived for several years
among the Philistines.

230
03:59:28,189 --> 03:59:30,657
A cold people like their sea.

231
03:59:31,349 --> 03:59:32,748
We Hebrews are of the desert.

232
03:59:32,909 --> 03:59:35,628
We breathe its wind
and our blood runs hot with it.

233
03:59:35,789 --> 03:59:37,859
Our emotions are fierce,
like the desert wind.

234
03:59:38,029 --> 03:59:39,428
We worship our God fiercely...

235
03:59:39,589 --> 03:59:41,898
...we love fiercely,
we feel sorrow fiercely...

236
03:59:42,429 --> 03:59:45,899
...even the lesser sorrows,
like the absence of a loved one.

03:59:47,429 --> 03:59:49,067
Has Uriah been away for long?

238
03:59:49,669 --> 03:59:51,978
We have been married seven months.

239
03:59:52,189 --> 03:59:54,703
Of this time,
we have been together six days.

240
03:59:55,469 --> 03:59:57,425
A poor return on the hopes
your betrothal.

241
03:59:57,589 --> 04:00:00,706
DAVID: You are generous indeed
not to hate me.

242
04:00:00,909 --> 04:00:03,025
I had no hopes, sire.

243
04:00:03,229 --> 04:00:05,106
I first saw Uriah on our wedding day...

244
04:00:05,269 --> 04:00:08,022
...when my father brought me
to his house.

245
04:00:08,389 --> 04:00:11,347
Then six days is the sum
total of your love?

246
04:00:11,869 --> 04:00:15,544
Of our marriage, yes, sire.

247
04:00:35,469 --> 04:00:38,063
One of the vanities of kings
is that they think virtue...

248
04:00:38,229 --> 04:00:40,140
...can be rewarded with a bauble.

249
04:00:40,349 --> 04:00:43,785
How God must laugh
at the spectacle of unvirtuous kings...

250
04:00:43,949 --> 04:00:48,067
...hanging bits of rock
and metal on virtuous men.

251
04:01:05,429 --> 04:01:07,579
That is for virtue.

252
04:01:24,229 --> 04:01:27,187
Now you understand
why I sent for you.

253
04:01:28,989 --> 04:01:32,982
My understanding is not necessary,
sire.

254
04:01:33,989 --> 04:01:35,104
Why not?

255
04:01:35,269 --> 04:01:37,146
You are the king.

256
04:01:37,549 --> 04:01:39,346
Is that all?

257
04:01:39,909 --> 04:01:41,706
Well, leave the king out of it.

258
04:01:41,869 --> 04:01:44,303
Think if any man would be content
with such an answer.

259
04:01:44,469 --> 04:01:46,539
What other answer can I give, sire?

260
04:01:46,749 --> 04:01:50,537
You have sent for me
and made known to me your will.

261
04:01:50,749 --> 04:01:53,183
What else is there for me to say?

262
04:01:56,309 --> 04:01:58,425
In Egypt that would be enough.

263
04:02:02,109 --> 04:02:06,102
There, the pharaoh has certain rights
he can command but l...

264
04:02:06,269 --> 04:02:11,024
Even if I had the right I've never used
my power to take anything by force.

265
04:02:12,469 --> 04:02:15,745
All that I have ever had
has been given to me.

266
04:02:17,029 --> 04:02:19,543
Freely, without restraint.

267
04:02:19,709 --> 04:02:23,384
Even Israel. I refused the throne
until every elder of every tribe...

268
04:02:23,549 --> 04:02:26,461
...would come to me
and beg me to take it.

269
04:02:27,869 --> 04:02:30,224
It's been a kind of pride.

270
04:02:30,389 --> 04:02:32,584
My pride.

271
04:02:33,389 --> 04:02:36,586
Never to force myself on anyone.

272
04:02:37,829 --> 04:02:39,501
So I said nothing to you.

273
04:02:39,669 --> 04:02:43,139
Until you told me
that there is no love in your marriage.

274
04:02:45,669 --> 04:02:47,739
Yes, you told me that.

275
04:02:47,909 --> 04:02:49,501
And so did Uriah.

04:02:50,229 --> 04:02:54,063
DAVID:
His dream of glory is his wife in tears.

277
04:02:56,389 --> 04:02:58,220
You better go.

04:03:02,429 --> 04:03:03,748
Oh, no, keep that.

279
04:03:03,909 --> 04:03:06,901
It's only a stone
but you lend it beauty.

280
04:03:09,549 --> 04:03:11,619
Uriah's a fool.

281
04:03:12,149 --> 04:03:15,107
When I looked on you
from my terrace tonight...

282
04:03:15,269 --> 04:03:17,908
...I knew that every future moment
spent away from you...

283
04:03:18,069 --> 04:03:20,219
...would be a moment lost.

284
04:03:20,389 --> 04:03:24,780
Yet he's found only six days for you
in seven months.

285
04:03:24,949 --> 04:03:27,747
The perfume of his beloved
is the stink of war.

286
04:03:27,909 --> 04:03:30,548
Does he think a man was made
only for the agony of battle?

287
04:03:30,709 --> 04:03:34,179
Does he call that manhood?
Has he no blood, no heart?

288
04:03:39,189 --> 04:03:40,941
Now go.

289
04:03:43,949 --> 04:03:46,463
And be thankful
that I am not the pharaoh.

290
04:03:49,789 --> 04:03:52,861
At least I can console myself
with the thought that your modesty...

291
04:03:53,029 --> 04:03:54,621
...matches your beauty.

292
04:03:56,149 --> 04:03:58,788
Perhaps you would prefer
truth to modesty, sire.

293
04:04:01,349 --> 04:04:04,022
Before you went away,
I used to watch you every evening...

294
04:04:04,189 --> 04:04:06,145
...as you walked on your terrace...

295
04:04:06,309 --> 04:04:10,097
...always at the same hour,
always alone.

Yes.

299
04:04:17,989 --> 04:04:23,063
I had heard that never had the king
found a woman to please him.

300
04:04:23,829 --> 04:04:26,104
I dared to hope
that I might be that woman.

301
04:04:27,749 --> 04:04:30,138
Why are you telling me this now?
Why not before?

302
04:04:30,309 --> 04:04:32,140
Because first...

303
04:04:32,309 --> 04:04:34,698
...I had to know
what was in your heart.

If the law of Moses is to be broken,
David...

305
04:04:37,429 --> 04:04:41,581
...let us break it in full understanding
of what we want from each other.

306
04:04:45,989 --> 04:04:49,504
No, please. I'm not finished.

307
04:04:51,429 --> 04:04:54,785
There are women you could send for
and send away again.

308

What do you want?

310
04:05:00,389 --> 04:05:02,505
To please you.

311
04:05:02,829 --> 04:05:06,583
Have I not made it plain enough
that you please me?

312
04:05:06,989 --> 04:05:09,947
I'll never send you away,
if that is what you want.

...but of all the days
and all the nights to come.

But you're not free.

321
04:05:40,309 --> 04:05:41,867
If I were free?

322
04:05:43,749 --> 04:05:46,138
A king is not supposed
to need anything.

323
04:05:46,629 --> 04:05:48,620
Only a fool would suppose that.

I never see their eyes...

04:06:03,109 --> 04:06:06,419
...only the tops of their heads
as they bow to me.

330

Their hands are extended to me...

...but palms upwards, for favors.

04:06:17,629 --> 04:06:19,665
Will I see your eyes, Bathsheba?

You will see them.

I need someone to understand that.

04:06:37,829 --> 04:06:40,184
I need the kind of understanding...

340
04:06:40,349 --> 04:06:43,625
...that only one human being
can give to another.

04:06:44,989 --> 04:06:48,026
I need someone to share my heart.

342

The man I watched from my window
is not the king...

is well worth the sharing.

528
04:27:22,429 --> 04:27:23,748
...I bring you trouble.

529
04:27:24,869 --> 04:27:27,303
Our secret is no longer a secret.

530
04:27:27,469 --> 04:27:29,699
- Who has learned it?
- No one yet.

531

But soon all will know
who have eyes to see.

532
04:27:33,869 --> 04:27:37,544
I'm sure now of what I have feared
this past week.

533
04:27:38,109 --> 04:27:40,339
I am with child.

534
04:27:40,909 --> 04:27:42,900

535

No need for tears.

536
04:27:50,949 --> 04:27:53,224
You bring me only joy.

537
04:27:53,389 --> 04:27:55,778
DAVID: What man would not be happy
to learn that his wife...

538
04:27:55,949 --> 04:27:57,746
...will give him a child?

539
04:27:59,229 --> 04:28:03,017
- I am not your wife.
- You are my only wife.

540
04:28:03,189 --> 04:28:07,660
DAVID:
Please, beloved, do not be afraid.

04:28:07,829 --> 04:28:09,820
BATHSHEBA:
I am not afraid.

542
04:28:10,749 --> 04:28:13,786
Soon enough we must all go down
to Sheol.

543
04:28:13,949 --> 04:28:16,509
My tears are for our child
who will never see the light.

544
04:28:16,669 --> 04:28:18,307
Bathsheba, listen to me.

545
04:28:18,469 --> 04:28:19,902
You will not die.

546
04:28:20,069 --> 04:28:23,505
- The law says that I must.
- They would not dare. I am the king.

547
04:28:23,669 --> 04:28:27,582
The Israelites have had kings
for less than 50 years.

548
04:28:28,709 --> 04:28:31,177
BATHSHEBA: They have had
the law of Moses for hundreds.

549
04:28:31,349 --> 04:28:34,261
I will give them their kingdom.
You and I will flee into Egypt.

550
04:28:34,429 --> 04:28:36,147
BATHSHEBA:
No, David.

551
04:28:37,629 --> 04:28:41,065
Your life is marked out
on a certain course.

552
04:28:41,229 --> 04:28:44,938
Even you cannot change it
if it's God's design.

553
04:28:56,549 --> 04:28:58,699
There is another answer.

554
04:29:00,069 --> 04:29:01,900
Uriah.

555
04:29:02,629 --> 04:29:04,779
Uriah is a soldier.

556
04:29:04,949 --> 04:29:08,828
Soldiers die every day in battle
and not always by enemy hands.

557
04:29:08,989 --> 04:29:10,707
No, David.

558
04:29:10,909 --> 04:29:14,106
Even our love could not bear
the burden of such a crime.

559
04:29:16,109 --> 04:29:18,543
The crime lies in the chance
that I was born a Hebrew.

560
04:29:18,709 --> 04:29:21,462
In any other nation on earth,
Uriah's life would be forfeit.

561
04:29:21,669 --> 04:29:23,546
It would be no less a crime.

562
04:29:28,709 --> 04:29:31,348
If I sent for him,
told him everything...

563
04:29:32,869 --> 04:29:35,542
We both know what he would say.

564
04:29:37,069 --> 04:29:40,266
DAVID: Yes. Honor is everything,
charity nothing.

565
04:29:41,149 --> 04:29:42,980
For the sake of honor,
blood must flow...

566
04:29:43,149 --> 04:29:46,300
...lives must be ruined,
humanity denied.

567
04:29:46,829 --> 04:29:50,583
I can see Uriah now,
hurrying to the gate...

568
04:29:50,749 --> 04:29:52,580
...eager to be
the first to cast a stone.

ABISHAl:
Sire.

570
04:29:57,069 --> 04:29:58,104
What is it, Abishai?

571
04:29:58,309 --> 04:30:00,539
The orders for Joab, sire.

572
04:30:10,669 --> 04:30:12,421
Yes.

573
04:30:20,229 --> 04:30:22,379
Do not send it now.

574
04:30:22,549 --> 04:30:24,665
I may want to add to the message.

575
04:30:24,829 --> 04:30:26,501
Yes, sire.

576
04:30:36,389 --> 04:30:37,947
DAVID:
There is another way.

577
04:30:41,389 --> 04:30:43,857
Perhaps it will solve nothing...

578
04:30:44,869 --> 04:30:47,463
...but at least it will gain us time.

579
04:30:50,469 --> 04:30:55,384
If Uriah can be made to believe
that the child is his.

580
04:30:55,549 --> 04:30:58,188
But he has been away almost a year.

581
04:30:58,349 --> 04:31:00,340
DAVID:
I will send for him...

582
04:31:00,869 --> 04:31:03,542
...to report on the campaign.

583
04:31:04,469 --> 04:31:07,267
He will be here in Jerusalem
one night...

584
04:31:07,709 --> 04:31:09,461
...perhaps two.

585
04:31:11,189 --> 04:31:13,657
- You called me your wife.
DAVID: The law calls you his.

586
04:31:13,829 --> 04:31:16,627
That is not worthy of you, David.

587
04:31:17,509 --> 04:31:20,626
It tears my heart
to suggest such a thing.

588
04:31:23,349 --> 04:31:26,068
But it is your life, beloved.

04:31:26,589 --> 04:31:28,739
Your life.

590
04:31:29,949 --> 04:31:32,144
It is shameful what you ask.

591
04:31:32,309 --> 04:31:34,982
There is no shame too great...

592
04:31:35,309 --> 04:31:39,018
...no act so vile
that I would not commit it...

593
04:31:39,789 --> 04:31:42,257
...if it would save my love.

Come, Uriah.

Absalom, it is many days
since we have seen you at the palace.

599
04:34:13,149 --> 04:34:16,459
I have been in Judah, sire,
tending to my vines.

600
04:34:16,669 --> 04:34:18,944
And do you expect a good yield
from your vines?

601
04:34:19,149 --> 04:34:21,617
I have no reason
to be dissatisfied, sire.

602
04:34:21,829 --> 04:34:24,059
In such a bad year.

603
04:34:24,269 --> 04:34:26,339
You're to be congratulated.

- I should like a word with you in private.
URIAH: I am at my king's service.

04:34:33,909 --> 04:34:35,581
I will not keep you long.

606
04:34:35,749 --> 04:34:40,106
You must be eager to go home
to your wife.

- Yes, sire.

With your permission, I plan
to return to camp early tomorrow...

...so that I may lead
my hundred into the battle.

612
04:34:54,749 --> 04:34:58,708
As you wish. Abishai will have
dispatches for you to carry.

Well, I might believe that,
but you have a wife.

616

My wife is nothing, sire,
beside my duty.

617
04:35:13,949 --> 04:35:16,179
Sit down, Uriah.

618
04:35:18,029 --> 04:35:19,860
They say she is very beautiful.

As women go.

620
04:35:32,709 --> 04:35:36,987
A woman does not always share
her husband's devotion to duty.

Have you ever tried to think of things
from her point of view?

No, sire.

- That is the law.
- The law.

The law can only control
what we do...

Is it possible that you believe
that she does not think or feel?

A woman is flesh and blood,
Uriah, like us.

633
04:36:09,509 --> 04:36:13,582
Perhaps more so because we give her so
little to think of but matters of the flesh.

634
04:36:13,749 --> 04:36:16,104
In all our history,
only a handful of women...

637

A woman's occupation
is her husband...

...and her life is her love.

639
04:36:30,309 --> 04:36:34,348
But if her husband rejects her love,
if he puts another love before it...

640
04:36:34,509 --> 04:36:38,548
...if he denies her the only meaning
that her life can have...

641
04:36:39,509 --> 04:36:43,218
...is it not understandable
if she seeks a meaning for it elsewhere?

- Yes.
- Lf she does, she breaks the law.

...under the law,
he is the one who must condemn her.

- You know nothing.
- The lady has servants.

Servants tell things to other servants
and they tell them to their mistresses.

URIAH: I swore that while the army
still slept in tents...

699
04:42:47,469 --> 04:42:50,381
...while Rabbah still stood in defiance
of God's will...

700
04:42:50,989 --> 04:42:55,141
...I would deny myself the comforts
and the pleasures of my own house.

701
04:42:55,749 --> 04:42:57,501
URIAH:
I would keep myself clean for battle...

702
04:42:57,669 --> 04:42:59,705
...as if for entering the tabernacle
of the Ark.

703
04:43:03,229 --> 04:43:06,460

713

of the hottest battle.

714
04:44:06,509 --> 04:44:09,103

715
04:44:09,349 --> 04:44:11,704

No.

I will not add hypocrisy
to my other sins.

what I intend...

...I cannot ask him to share
the burden of my guilt.

722

Set Uriah in the forefront
of the hottest battle...

723
04:44:38,669 --> 04:44:41,627
...and retire from him
that he may be smitten and die.

724
04:44:41,789 --> 04:44:43,347
- Yes.
- When it is finished...

725
04:44:43,549 --> 04:44:46,109
...seal it and give it to Uriah.

726
04:44:48,829 --> 04:44:50,467
Yes, sire.

727
04:45:58,029 --> 04:46:00,827
Sire, we bring great news.

728
04:46:00,989 --> 04:46:03,219
The walls of Rabbah
have been breached.

729
04:46:03,389 --> 04:46:06,187
When we left, there was fighting
in the streets of the city.

730
04:46:06,349 --> 04:46:08,943
Joab bids me urge you
to come to Rabbah with all speed...

731
04:46:09,109 --> 04:46:11,623
...to receive the surrender
of your enemies.

732
04:46:17,669 --> 04:46:19,022
And our dead?

733
04:46:19,189 --> 04:46:21,828
Our losses have been heavy, sire.

734
04:46:21,989 --> 04:46:23,707
Of the captains of a thousand:

735
04:46:23,869 --> 04:46:28,021
Abimelech the son of Jurabiel,
and Heled the son of lkkesh.

736

There was a mistake in the orders, sire.

748
04:47:00,749 --> 04:47:05,345
Uriah advanced too far into the breach
and was cut off from his command.

to return to Rabbah, I'll ride with you.

Sire, the lady Bathsheba's servant
is waiting for your answer.

Go to Bathsheba.

Tell her that Uriah is dead.

Tell her to prepare for our marriage...

755
04:47:38,429 --> 04:47:40,385
...at the end of her month
of mourning.

756
04:47:40,589 --> 04:47:42,784
Will you not go to her yourself?

No.

758
04:48:33,269 --> 04:48:37,182
The hand of God
is heavy on his people.

759
04:48:37,349 --> 04:48:39,021
Thus speaks the Lord:

760
04:48:39,229 --> 04:48:40,742
"I will withhold the rains...

761
04:48:40,909 --> 04:48:43,867
...and cause the fields
and vineyards to dry up...

762
04:48:44,029 --> 04:48:45,781
...the flocks to grow thin.

763
04:48:45,949 --> 04:48:50,261
I will waste the land with drought,
the people with famine.

764
04:48:50,429 --> 04:48:53,865
Yea, I will smite Israel
for its sin against me.

765
04:48:54,029 --> 04:48:58,466
Woe unto Israel.
Woe unto my people who have sinned."

766
04:49:00,589 --> 04:49:01,908
What sin, Nathan?

767
04:49:02,909 --> 04:49:06,663
The Lord has not vouchsafed to me
its nature...

768
04:49:06,989 --> 04:49:09,184
...but evidently the sin is great...

769
04:49:09,789 --> 04:49:12,667
...thus to incur his wrath.

770
04:49:13,349 --> 04:49:15,704

to make him angry?

04:49:15,869 --> 04:49:19,623
That soldier who laid hands on the Ark,
he was only trying to be helpful.

772
04:49:19,789 --> 04:49:22,064
It is not for us to question
the ways of the Lord.

773
04:49:22,229 --> 04:49:24,185
I question nothing.

774
04:49:24,349 --> 04:49:28,058

The man had been drinking wine.

All were excited
when the Ark began to fall.

776
04:49:31,589 --> 04:49:35,707
Is it not possible that the man might
have died naturally from other causes?

777
04:49:35,869 --> 04:49:38,622
All causes are of God.

listened to the people talk of the king.

785

They say that David
is no longer David.

786
04:50:00,509 --> 04:50:04,138
They say that he neglects his duty,
that he is often away from the city.

787
04:50:04,309 --> 04:50:07,585
When he is here,
he has turned his face from his people.

There were two men,
one rich and one poor.

875
05:01:29,069 --> 05:01:32,345
The rich man owned
great flocks and herds.

876
05:01:32,509 --> 05:01:35,467
But the poor man had naught
but one ewe lamb.

877
05:01:35,629 --> 05:01:38,063
He reared it and it grew up with him
and his children.

878
05:01:38,229 --> 05:01:42,825
It ate of his food and drank of his cup.
It was like a daughter to him.

Now there came a wayfarer
to the rich man asking meat.

880
05:01:46,469 --> 05:01:49,984
But the rich man did not take
of his own flocks to feed his guest.

881
05:01:50,149 --> 05:01:53,858
Instead, he took the poor man's
one ewe lamb and slew it...

882
05:01:54,029 --> 05:01:56,065
...and prepared it for the wayfarer.
