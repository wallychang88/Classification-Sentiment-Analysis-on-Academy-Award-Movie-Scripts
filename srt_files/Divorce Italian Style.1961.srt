3
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,342
- Roast beef, sir?
- Yes.

4
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,008
- Potatoes?
- Two.

5
00:02:39,508 --> 00:02:41,175
That's enough.

6
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,217
<i>The serenades of the south.</i>

7
00:03:11,342 --> 00:03:14,675
<i>The sweet, warm, exhausting 
Sicilian nights.</i>

8
00:03:14,758 --> 00:03:17,092
<i>The whole time I'd been away,</i>

9
00:03:17,217 --> 00:03:20,758
<i>the memory of those nights...
or rather, of one particular night...</i>

10
00:03:20,883 --> 00:03:25,092
<i>had filled my days with longing 
and nostalgia.</i>

11
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:28,217
<i>Agramonte: 18,000 souls,</i>

12
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,967
<i>4,300 of them illiterate.</i>

13
00:03:30,092 --> 00:03:33,300
<i>1,700 either partially or fully 
unemployed.</i>

14
00:03:33,425 --> 00:03:36,258
<i>Twenty-four churches,
if I'm not mistaken,</i>

15
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:40,258
<i>including a few distinguished
Baroque specimens of the late 1600s.</i>

16
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:44,633
<i>This is the Cefalù palace,</i>

17
00:03:44,758 --> 00:03:46,800
<i>and this is my ancestors'
coat of arms.</i>

18
00:03:46,925 --> 00:03:50,175
<i>Practically the only thing
my father had not yet sold.</i>

19
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:51,758
<i>Papa's dissolute ways,</i>

20
00:03:51,842 --> 00:03:54,175
<i>whose nature I won't disclose
out of respect for Mama,</i>

21
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:57,342
<i>had reduced us to living
in a single wing of the palace,</i>

22
00:03:57,425 --> 00:04:01,883
<i>while the other wing was occupied
by my Uncle Calogero and his family.</i>

23
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:05,800
<i>But of this fateful cohabitation and
its consequences, I'll speak more later.</i>

24
00:04:06,842 --> 00:04:09,758
<i>Here's my father,
Baron Don Gaetano Cefalù.</i>

25
00:04:09,883 --> 00:04:11,675
<i>And these are his friends
from the social club.</i>

26
00:04:11,758 --> 00:04:14,592
- You're looking well, Baron.
- My respects, Don Gaetano.

27
00:04:14,717 --> 00:04:17,717
<i>For five seconds
he was the object of their gossip.</i>

28
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:21,592
<i>But here they are, once again engrossed
in their favorite topic: Women.</i>

29
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:23,675
<i>An inexhaustible subject.</i>

30
00:04:23,758 --> 00:04:26,008
<i>In the vivid imagination
of my townsmen,</i>

31
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:28,383
<i>women took on mythical status.</i>

32
00:04:28,508 --> 00:04:30,175
<i>The marvelous, invisible women 
of Agramonte,</i>

33
00:04:30,258 --> 00:04:33,050
<i>who hid their beauty and ardor
behind the grating...</i>

34
00:04:33,175 --> 00:04:36,092
<i>Pardon me... behind the slats 
of bashful shutters.</i>

35
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,842
<i>Meanwhile, Agramonte's working class</i>

36
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,342
<i>marched inexorably on
toward progress.</i>

37
00:04:48,758 --> 00:04:52,133
<i>This progress may have been
a tad slow... indeed.</i>

38
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,550
<i>But the audacious trumpets
of the working class</i>

39
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:57,925
<i>were answered by
the equally loud bells of San Filmino.</i>

40
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,717
Therefore, my faithful
and beloved fellow citizens,

41
00:05:05,883 --> 00:05:11,050
I exhort you to vote for a party 
that is of the people

42
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:13,883
and therefore democratic,

43
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:16,550
and therefore respectful of our 
Christian faith.

44
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,092
A party, in a word,

45
00:05:19,175 --> 00:05:22,592
both democratic and Christian.

46
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:37,133
<i>My wife, Rosalia.</i>

47
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:40,383
<i>Twelve years of marriage.</i>

48
00:05:43,717 --> 00:05:45,675
<i>Donna Matilde, my mother.</i>

49
00:05:48,967 --> 00:05:51,592
<i>My sister Agnese,
unmarried and still dependent,</i>

50
00:05:51,717 --> 00:05:55,508
<i>officially compromised...
i.e., engaged... to Rosario Mulè,</i>

51
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:58,592
<i>of the respected firm Mulè and Sons,</i>

52
00:05:58,675 --> 00:06:00,592
<i>a funeral parlor.</i>

53
00:06:05,342 --> 00:06:07,258
<i>And this is Don Calogero,</i>

54
00:06:07,342 --> 00:06:09,092
<i>intruder in the Cefalù Palace,</i>

55
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,967
<i>husband of Aunt Fifidda,
my father's sister.</i>

56
00:06:12,092 --> 00:06:15,175
<i>In a mere 15 years, this former farmer</i>

57
00:06:15,175 --> 00:06:17,800
<i>had paid off a number
of my father's rash gambling debts,</i>

58
00:06:17,925 --> 00:06:21,342
<i>enabling him to snatch up
our best plots of land.</i>

59
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,800
<i>And finally we come to Angela,</i>

60
00:06:25,592 --> 00:06:28,758
<i>daughter of Calogero and Fifidda
and thus my first cousin.</i>

61
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,925
<i>Angela attended high...</i>

62
00:06:32,342 --> 00:06:36,758
<i>Attended a high school
run by nuns in Catania.</i>

63
00:06:36,883 --> 00:06:39,467
<i>She spent her summer vacations
at home.</i>

64
00:06:51,425 --> 00:06:53,217
<i>I loved Angela.</i>

65
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:59,050
- Good night, Don Ferdinando.
- Regards to Donna Rosalia.

66
00:06:59,133 --> 00:07:00,842
- Good night.
- Rest well.

67
00:07:01,758 --> 00:07:03,050
Good night.

68
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:40,925
<i>Fefè.</i>

69
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:45,175
<i>- You feeling all right?
- I'm fine. Good night.</i>

70
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:29,592
Fefè.

71
00:08:30,675 --> 00:08:31,633
Yes?

72
00:08:31,758 --> 00:08:34,425
<i>- What is it? Aren't you well?
- I'm fine.</i>

73
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:36,050
What is it?

74
00:08:36,175 --> 00:08:38,717
Do you need anything? Some warm chamomile?

75
00:08:38,842 --> 00:08:42,133
I don't want anything. Go to bed.

76
00:08:42,633 --> 00:08:44,550
<i>Go to bed.</i>

77
00:09:16,508 --> 00:09:19,300
<i>- Who's in there?
- It's me, Papa.</i>

78
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:22,050
Hurry up, please.

79
00:09:22,592 --> 00:09:23,800
All right.

80
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:30,050
Gaetano, do you need me?

81
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:33,050
No, go to bed.

82
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:34,925
Get out of here!

83
00:09:43,675 --> 00:09:45,300
Sorry.

84
00:10:11,258 --> 00:10:14,550
I knew the garlic in the peppers
wouldn't agree with you.

85
00:10:15,425 --> 00:10:17,342
I told your mother so.

86
00:10:17,425 --> 00:10:20,800
She says you can't cook peppers
without garlic.

87
00:10:20,925 --> 00:10:24,217
It's true that they're not
as good without garlic.

88
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:27,675
But she should understand,

89
00:10:27,758 --> 00:10:31,717
there are some things a wife understands
better than a mother.

90
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,217
It's a matter of...

91
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:36,217
I don't know.

92
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:39,175
It's nothing I can spell out.

93
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,217
Don't you agree, Fefè?

94
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:54,758
I'm a little chilly.
It's so cold tonight.

95
00:10:54,883 --> 00:10:57,092
Rosalia, are you sick or something?

96
00:10:57,217 --> 00:11:00,092
The thermometer at the club read 
90º today.

97
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:03,883
Fefè, do you really love me?

98
00:11:03,967 --> 00:11:06,008
Of course I do.

99
00:11:07,008 --> 00:11:09,592
How much, Fefè, how much?

100
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:17,133
Your feet are so nice and cool.

101
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:53,050
<i>And yet... she had looked in 
my direction.</i>

102
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,175
You know what I was thinking?

103
00:12:17,258 --> 00:12:20,883
I was wondering,
why is it we're alive?

104
00:12:24,258 --> 00:12:27,842
Have you ever wondered
what the purpose of our lives is?

105
00:12:27,925 --> 00:12:30,467
- No. What is it?
- To love.

106
00:12:31,592 --> 00:12:34,342
To love. We live to love.

107
00:12:34,425 --> 00:12:37,717
- If we wasn't to love...
- "Weren't". If we weren't to love.

108
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:43,258
Yes, we would wilter,
like so many wiltered flowers.

109
00:12:44,758 --> 00:12:46,967
I mean, wilt... that's the word.

110
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,092
This abysmal heat!

111
00:12:54,175 --> 00:12:55,758
Do you need anything?

112
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:57,508
No. Go to sleep.

113
00:13:07,258 --> 00:13:09,675
Baroness, tell him to keep
his hands to himself!

114
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:12,258
You watch out,
or I'll tell your father.

115
00:13:12,342 --> 00:13:13,967
You know how he is.

116
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:17,717
- What can I do?
- Be quiet! You're a tease.

117
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:20,675
Last night I pushed my dresser up 
against the door,

118
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,467
but the minute I turned my back...

119
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:26,675
Don Fefè, you tell him.
- So don't turn your back.

120
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,758
Oh, my God, someone's coming!

121
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,217
Don Ferdinando!

122
00:13:36,342 --> 00:13:38,008
Agnese, please.

123
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:41,633
Don Ferdinando,
Agnese and I must get married.

124
00:13:41,758 --> 00:13:43,925
Soon. Before Christmas.

125
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:47,467
Yes, we'll discuss it,
but there's still plenty of time.

126
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:51,133
But first I have to finish
mourning my poor grandfather.

127
00:13:51,258 --> 00:13:55,383
Don't get any ideas.
Rosario has always respected me.

128
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,300
I swear!

129
00:13:59,092 --> 00:14:02,717
Well, I'll be going.

130
00:14:03,508 --> 00:14:05,217
Excuse me.

131
00:14:12,758 --> 00:14:17,217
<i>Well, I guess I am a rather 
interesting man...</i>

132
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,383
<i>refined, intelligent.</i>

133
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:25,383
<i>But that stomach!</i>

134
00:14:26,592 --> 00:14:31,092
<i>I'll have to cut out fats, 
sugars and starches.</i>

135
00:14:31,217 --> 00:14:33,175
<i>I'll have to cut out everything!</i>

136
00:14:49,383 --> 00:14:52,633
I brought you your coffee,
freshly brewed.

137
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,383
- Were you resting?
- Yes.

138
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,383
Not so much. Just a bit.

139
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:13,383
What do you mean? You like it sweet.

140
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:14,925
Not anymore.

141
00:15:16,425 --> 00:15:20,717
Fefè, can I have a sip?
Just a tiny sip.

142
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,425
- There's a potful right there.
- No, from your cup.

143
00:15:37,425 --> 00:15:39,467
- Are you crazy?
- A gray hair.

144
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:43,133
Now that I've pulled one out,
seven more will grow in.

145
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:47,217
Gray temples are so distinguished.
Did you know that?

146
00:15:55,258 --> 00:15:57,967
Sisina, watch the wind!

147
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,592
The house is filling with smoke!

148
00:15:59,717 --> 00:16:01,550
How many times must I tell you, idiot!

149
00:16:01,633 --> 00:16:02,842
I can't help that.

150
00:16:05,508 --> 00:16:08,717
You have to talk to your mother,
for crying out loud!

151
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,592
We made soap on the 18th of last month,
and it's only the 11th!

152
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:14,675
Do you know what we spend
in a month just on soap?

153
00:16:14,758 --> 00:16:17,342
Please, don't start this again.

154
00:16:17,467 --> 00:16:18,550
What?

155
00:16:18,675 --> 00:16:21,800
Can't you buy ready-made soap 
at the store?

156
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:27,383
If we used our heads more,
we could save some real money.

157
00:16:27,508 --> 00:16:31,133
Believe me, your mother's
going to hear about this!

158
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,008
<i>Couldn't you find some other 
time to make soap?</i>

159
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,550
- We have to make it.
- The house is filling with smoke!

160
00:16:52,633 --> 00:16:54,758
We're suffocating!

161
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:57,300
<i>Good girl, Sisina.</i>

162
00:18:15,758 --> 00:18:20,092
<i>Sometimes we'd go to the beach 
in the summer.</i>

163
00:18:21,092 --> 00:18:25,300
<i>Rosalia would bury herself
in the sand for her arthritis.</i>

164
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:40,967
Would you move my umbrella?

165
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,425
<i>Oh, my God, someone's coming!</i>

166
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,383
- Warm day.
- Yes, quite.

167
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,633
We weren't doing anything wrong. 
I swear.

168
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,883
I know.

169
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,592
Baron, we never had that talk.
I'm ready when you are.

170
00:19:40,758 --> 00:19:43,425
- Christmas is still a ways off.
- Right, well...

171
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,133
Excuse us.

172
00:19:57,925 --> 00:20:00,342
<i>Angela!</i>

173
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,925
Angela, what are you doing?

174
00:20:30,883 --> 00:20:35,008
Picking flowers in honor
of the Immaculate Conception.

175
00:20:35,092 --> 00:20:37,717
I felt like picking flowers too.

176
00:20:39,258 --> 00:20:42,883
I just wouldn't know who to give 
them to.

177
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,800
You know what I mean, don't you?

178
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:53,800
Yes.

179
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,592
They smell so nice!

180
00:21:05,092 --> 00:21:07,342
The other day as you were leaving church,

181
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:10,342
you looked at me.

182
00:21:10,425 --> 00:21:12,425
Why did you look at me that way?

183
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:17,758
So you've thought about it, eh?

184
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:28,008
- Wait.
- Here.

185
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:43,092
There he is. My beloved son
was off picking flowers.

186
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,758
Got some real flowers too
while he was at it.

187
00:21:45,925 --> 00:21:47,883
Papa, you know how to ruin 
a poetic moment.

188
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:50,008
Rosalia is right.

189
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:56,633
Fefè, what lovely flowers.

190
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:02,050
Thank you, my son.

191
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:08,633
- How nice. Where'd you find them?
- Over there.

192
00:22:45,258 --> 00:22:47,675
Bring them closer so I can smell them.

193
00:22:50,925 --> 00:22:52,550
So pretty.

194
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:07,258
MAN ORBITS EARTH

195
00:23:29,092 --> 00:23:32,883
Fefè, I feel a strange dissatisfaction
deep inside.

196
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:35,258
For instance, you know
how much I like grapes.

197
00:23:35,383 --> 00:23:38,592
Well, I like grapes most
when we have none.

198
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:42,175
When we have grapes,
I feel like eating pears.

199
00:23:43,133 --> 00:23:47,050
<i>Last year in Agramonte, the homicide
rate was 2. 1%. That's something.</i>

200
00:23:47,133 --> 00:23:50,717
At your service, Baron. Baroness.

201
00:23:52,758 --> 00:23:56,508
- Anyway, where was I?
- You look like a princess!

202
00:23:58,425 --> 00:24:02,092
<i>Don Ciccio Matara,
Natalino Urso's henchman,</i>

203
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:04,550
<i>the man who torched
the Mazzalorso family's land.</i>

204
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:07,383
<i>Horrible things were said
about Don Ciccio.</i>

205
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:09,717
<i>Two years ago they killed 
that woman Cesira,</i>

206
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:11,467
<i>right here on her way to church.</i>

207
00:24:11,592 --> 00:24:13,050
<i>And no one saw a thing.</i>

208
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:23,050
<i>But to be beholden forever
to Don Ciccio Matara...</i>

209
00:24:23,175 --> 00:24:25,300
<i>no, no, no.</i>

210
00:24:25,425 --> 00:24:27,133
See you tonight, then.

211
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,175
- Where was I, Fefè?
- Pears.

212
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,883
Right. For me it's not
the grapes in themselves,

213
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,925
as much as my desire for them.

214
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,967
Like that poem I like so much,

215
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:42,883
that says Saturdays are so much 
better than Sundays.

216
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,883
Hello again.

217
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,550
<i>I'll kill her!</i>

218
00:25:00,883 --> 00:25:03,092
- Gaetano!
- Shut up!

219
00:25:07,258 --> 00:25:08,550
<i>I don't deserve this!</i>

220
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,467
<i>I didn't know it yet.</i>

221
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:13,800
<i>But that night would mark
a turning point in my life.</i>

222
00:25:15,175 --> 00:25:16,967
I'll kick him out of this house!

223
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:18,883
Stop your father!

224
00:25:18,967 --> 00:25:20,133
Papa, what is it?

225
00:25:20,258 --> 00:25:25,092
He had the nerve to wave two 
25,000-lire notes in my face!

226
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:28,300
Aunt Fifidda was calling for help.
What do notes have to do with it?

227
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:31,092
I don't know. I think
he's beating his daughter.

228
00:25:32,925 --> 00:25:36,133
Come here, you hussy!

229
00:25:36,925 --> 00:25:39,425
Fifidda, open up! It's me!

230
00:25:39,592 --> 00:25:40,842
What's the scoundrel's name?

231
00:25:40,967 --> 00:25:44,133
- He'll kill the poor child!
- Let me in!

232
00:25:44,258 --> 00:25:45,633
His name!

233
00:25:46,217 --> 00:25:48,383
I'll never tell you!

234
00:25:48,467 --> 00:25:51,258
Tell me the name of that scoundrel!

235
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:54,467
Stop it! Calm down!

236
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,592
Cover yourself up, you hussy!

237
00:26:11,425 --> 00:26:13,258
Come on, let's go.

238
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,467
The hussy!

239
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:21,092
Excuse me.

240
00:26:29,842 --> 00:26:32,592
No, not her!

241
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,925
What's the midwife doing here?

242
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,925
- I want to know her condition.
- Why?

243
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,258
She has a lover.

244
00:26:38,383 --> 00:26:42,050
Yes. Her diary's right here.

245
00:26:42,383 --> 00:26:45,217
Read for yourself.

246
00:26:45,592 --> 00:26:48,050
I'll kill her with my own hands!

247
00:26:49,092 --> 00:26:53,133
<i>Today it finally happened.
Surrounded by all those flowers...</i>

248
00:26:53,258 --> 00:26:56,550
- Fefè, what happened?
- Nothing. They're all in the next room.

249
00:26:56,633 --> 00:26:58,592
I'll go take a look.

250
00:27:04,925 --> 00:27:09,550
<i>Today it finally happened.
Surrounded by all those flowers...</i>

251
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:13,092
<i>we met, and...</i>

252
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:17,008
<i>But it's too marvelous for words.</i>

253
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:20,467
<i>Now I'm his forever!</i>

254
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:29,633
<i>My sweet love...</i>

255
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:35,300
<i>beaten, humiliated, examined.</i>

256
00:27:36,092 --> 00:27:40,300
<i>The smile on that witch's face
when she said to your father,</i>

257
00:27:41,258 --> 00:27:43,008
<i>"Undefiled".</i>

258
00:27:44,758 --> 00:27:46,675
<i>Undefiled.</i>

259
00:27:48,592 --> 00:27:50,258
<i>My poor Angela.</i>

260
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:52,008
<i>You're a flower.</i>

261
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,050
<i>A delicate lily.</i>

262
00:30:09,217 --> 00:30:10,758
Why are you crying?

263
00:30:13,092 --> 00:30:14,717
Why?

264
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,592
Aren't you cold?

265
00:30:20,717 --> 00:30:22,967
Look what he did to me.

266
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:28,467
But I didn't say a word about us.

267
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:30,175
My love.

268
00:30:30,258 --> 00:30:32,342
I'm leaving. I'm going away.

269
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:35,383
They're sending me back to school.

270
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:39,925
No, we mustn't.

271
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:48,675
Angela, you're mine!

272
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,883
<i>She left the next day
on the 10:20 bus,</i>

273
00:31:22,758 --> 00:31:26,300
<i>accompanied by two nuns from 
the Convent of the Seven Sorrows.</i>

274
00:31:30,592 --> 00:31:33,425
Good-bye, my love.

275
00:31:50,133 --> 00:31:52,425
<i>That same week, in Catania,</i>

276
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:54,508
<i>the trial of Mariannina Terranova
was starting,</i>

277
00:31:54,592 --> 00:31:57,800
<i>who had committed a crime of passion.</i>

278
00:31:57,925 --> 00:32:01,383
<i>I'm sure you remember
the hullabaloo in the press.</i>

279
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:05,592
<i>The two-timing victim,
Vito Cafiero, a 24-year-old student.</i>

280
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,758
<i>The pathetic figure of the killer,
Mariannina Terranova,</i>

281
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,758
<i>his 26-year-old common-law wife.</i>

282
00:32:10,883 --> 00:32:13,050
<i>Mariannina had taken a train</i>

283
00:32:13,133 --> 00:32:16,092
<i>and gone to empty her gun
into the body of her beloved</i>

284
00:32:16,175 --> 00:32:18,300
<i>as he left a movie theater
in Catania.</i>

285
00:32:18,425 --> 00:32:22,175
<i>The collective honor of the south
had found its heroine.</i>

286
00:32:30,092 --> 00:32:34,800
Mariannina Terranova,
where did you get the murder weapon?

287
00:32:36,092 --> 00:32:38,633
- He gave it to me.
- Who's "he"?

288
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:44,008
Him. He said: "If I ever cheat on you,
kill me with this".

289
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,258
And then?

290
00:32:45,967 --> 00:32:47,008
And then?

291
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:52,217
And then... he destroyed my honor.

292
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:55,008
Good for you, Mariannina!

293
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:57,508
Remove that woman!

294
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,717
Gentlemen of the jury.

295
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:13,008
"Lips once kissed long for more".

296
00:33:13,717 --> 00:33:17,508
But I say, paraphrasing
a much more lofty and sacred text,

297
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,008
"He who looks at a woman with desire

298
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:23,758
has already sinned in his heart".

299
00:33:24,092 --> 00:33:29,467
So while the train carried Mariannina
Terranova to her fateful destination,

300
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:35,008
unstoppable as the destiny
that drove her on.

301
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:37,550
This poor, diminutive creature 
of the south.

302
00:33:37,633 --> 00:33:39,883
Wrapped in the age-old dark shawl,

303
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:42,133
symbol of our women's modesty,

304
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:44,592
wringing her hands in her lap,

305
00:33:44,717 --> 00:33:47,383
her womb condemned by God

306
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:51,175
to suffer the divine pangs
of motherhood,

307
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:55,550
while the train raced on
as in an inescapable nightmare,

308
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:59,383
the rhythmic thrust
of the pistons pounding

309
00:33:59,467 --> 00:34:02,758
in the delirious ears
of poor, ruined Mariannina...

310
00:34:02,883 --> 00:34:04,967
"Dishonored, dishonored, dishonored".

311
00:34:14,342 --> 00:34:18,050
<i>Honor, my friends. What is honor?</i>

312
00:34:18,717 --> 00:34:22,050
<i>Shall we accept the definition
given by the venerable Tomaseo</i>

313
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:24,508
<i>in his monumental dictionary
of the Italian language:</i>

314
00:34:24,592 --> 00:34:30,425
<i>"The moral and civic attributes
that render a man respectable</i>

315
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:33,758
<i>and respected in the society
in which he lives"?</i>

316
00:34:33,925 --> 00:34:38,467
<i>Or shall we throw that out
like some worn-out, useless thing?</i>

317
00:34:39,592 --> 00:34:43,342
<i>Letters! Letters written by anonymous
but symbolic hands.</i>

318
00:34:43,425 --> 00:34:47,008
Illegible letters that would offend
the dignity of this courtroom.

319
00:34:47,092 --> 00:34:49,883
<i>Blunt and concise, like this one,</i>

320
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,758
<i>which in one word renders poor 
Mariannina's fate:</i>

321
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:54,467
"Cuckoldess"!

322
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,383
<i>Or this one, which uses a crude image
to express the nefarious thought.</i>

323
00:35:01,425 --> 00:35:05,342
<i>Cuckold! Dishonored!</i>

324
00:35:05,467 --> 00:35:11,217
<i>The Cefalù family name,
my lineage, sullied by a tramp!</i>

325
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:15,258
Tramp.

326
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:21,592
<i>Let's take a look.</i>

327
00:35:32,342 --> 00:35:33,633
<i>Here we are.</i>

328
00:35:34,092 --> 00:35:37,175
<i>Article 587 of the Penal Code:</i>

329
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:40,050
<i>"He who causes the death
of spouse, daughter or sister</i>

330
00:35:40,217 --> 00:35:43,133
<i>upon discovering her
in illegitimate carnal relations</i>

331
00:35:43,258 --> 00:35:47,175
<i>and in the heat of passion
caused by the offense to his honor</i>

332
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,925
<i>or that of his family will be sentenced
to three to seven years".</i>

333
00:35:50,258 --> 00:35:52,467
<i>Three to seven years. Let's see.</i>

334
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:55,550
<i>I'm 37 years old.
Seven more makes 44.</i>

335
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:58,508
<i>Angela is 16, plus seven...</i>

336
00:36:01,008 --> 00:36:02,592
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

337
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,675
<i>Seven years is the maximum.</i>

338
00:36:04,758 --> 00:36:07,842
<i>Terranova... No, her crime
can't be considered the same.</i>

339
00:36:07,883 --> 00:36:11,758
<i>The law is clear. It considers 
the jealousy of the woman,</i>

340
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,717
<i>but it doesn't protect her honor.</i>

341
00:36:14,425 --> 00:36:16,842
EIGHT YEARS FOR MARIANNINA
MORAL INSULT MITIGATES SENTENCE

342
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,925
FOR NATIVE OF AGRAMONTE
WHO WAS SEDUCED AND ABANDONED

343
00:36:20,092 --> 00:36:21,758
<i>Eight years.</i>

344
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:24,258
<i>That's certainly
quite a stretch of time,</i>

345
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:26,050
<i>but she's a bricklayer's daughter.</i>

346
00:36:26,175 --> 00:36:28,967
<i>She's vulgar, ignorant, ugly.
A common-law wife!</i>

347
00:36:29,425 --> 00:36:32,925
<i>Whereas I'm a gentleman,
with a college degree,</i>

348
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,383
<i>an exemplary husband
of almost 15 years.</i>

349
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:37,050
<i>An aristocrat!</i>

350
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,675
<i>Yes, gentlemen of the jury,
an aristocrat.</i>

351
00:36:39,758 --> 00:36:44,592
<i>These are dark times, full of greed
and cynical scientific materialism.</i>

352
00:36:44,717 --> 00:36:48,675
<i>But aristocrats are not
aristocrats for nothing. No, sir!</i>

353
00:36:48,758 --> 00:36:52,800
<i>But I'm certainly not going
to hark back to the Crusades.</i>

354
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:55,633
<i>No, let's stick to the facts.</i>

355
00:36:57,758 --> 00:36:59,758
<i>Gentlemen of the jury,</i>

356
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:02,342
<i>is there anything
in the letter of the law</i>

357
00:37:02,425 --> 00:37:05,800
<i>that does not perfectly fit
this man's tragic situation?</i>

358
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:09,217
<i>Was there not the heat of passion?
Was his honor not offended</i>

359
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,550
<i>the instant he discovered
his beloved spouse</i>

360
00:37:11,675 --> 00:37:14,592
<i>swooning in her lover's arms?</i>

361
00:37:15,258 --> 00:37:19,342
<i>A lover for Rosalia... who could it be?</i>

362
00:37:19,467 --> 00:37:22,050
<i>He'd have to be hand-picked.</i>

363
00:37:22,592 --> 00:37:25,883
<i>Someone I could bring
into the house. Into her bed.</i>

364
00:37:25,967 --> 00:37:29,800
<i>But who could it be?</i>

365
00:37:34,883 --> 00:37:36,717
<i>I bought her that dress in Catania,</i>

366
00:37:36,842 --> 00:37:39,800
<i>and took her for a stroll
for a specific reason.</i>

367
00:37:39,925 --> 00:37:41,842
- Baroness.
- Professor.

368
00:37:41,925 --> 00:37:44,842
<i>- My respects.
- No, the professor won't work.</i>

369
00:37:45,092 --> 00:37:48,967
- Fefè, everyone's looking at me.
- No, they're not.

370
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,925
<i>I wanted to see if those 
well-rounded hips,</i>

371
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:53,383
<i>that had clinched my proposal 
of marriage...</i>

372
00:37:53,717 --> 00:37:55,592
<i>I was young and inexperienced then.</i>

373
00:37:55,717 --> 00:38:00,383
<i>Anyway, I wanted to see if Rosalia's hips
still attracted men's attention,</i>

374
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:04,425
<i>and in effect,
it seemed they did indeed.</i>

375
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:08,967
You must be warm.

376
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:32,092
<i>No, not the marshal.
Certainly no one related to the law.</i>

377
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,467
<i>Absolutely not Don Ciccio Matara.</i>

378
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:52,175
I can feel a draft.

379
00:39:14,675 --> 00:39:16,258
<i>Perhaps an artistic type,</i>

380
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,550
<i>a soul mate.</i>

381
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,383
<i>I wonder if Tonino Gambacurta
would be suitable.</i>

382
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:51,800
What a lovely voice Tonino has.

383
00:39:51,925 --> 00:39:53,008
What?

384
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,592
Poor boy.

385
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:01,425
Why "poor boy"?

386
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,842
Don't you know?

387
00:40:23,675 --> 00:40:27,300
<i>Definitely not Tonino.</i>

388
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:42,675
Good night.

389
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:09,258
If you don't say it,
I can't go to sleep.

390
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,883
Yes, I love you. Good night.

391
00:41:12,175 --> 00:41:14,758
How much, Fefè?

392
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,925
Why?

393
00:41:30,508 --> 00:41:31,675
Enough!

394
00:42:46,883 --> 00:42:48,008
<i>Ferdinando.</i>

395
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:50,008
Mama's brought you some breakfast.

396
00:42:51,133 --> 00:42:53,258
- Do it for me.
- Go away!

397
00:42:56,925 --> 00:42:59,925
- Be patient.
- I always have to suffer.

398
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:04,175
One day he's all sugar and honey,
and then all of a sudden...

399
00:43:05,925 --> 00:43:09,925
Rosalia, keep one thing in mind:
He loves you.

400
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,883
That much is certain.

401
00:43:21,258 --> 00:43:23,717
What are you yelling about?
Go away!

402
00:43:25,342 --> 00:43:26,967
Animal.

403
00:43:30,383 --> 00:43:32,467
What are you looking at?
I'm talking to you.

404
00:43:32,592 --> 00:43:33,633
Idiot!

405
00:43:52,842 --> 00:43:54,467
Carmelino.

406
00:46:18,092 --> 00:46:21,842
<i>I saw you yesterday, Rosalia,
during the procession.</i>

407
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:24,425
<i>You were as beautiful
and pure as the Virgin Mary.</i>

408
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:32,217
<i>I wanted to die on the spot.</i>

409
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:36,008
<i>To die with that image
of you in my soul,</i>

410
00:46:36,092 --> 00:46:38,217
<i>with this immense desire
to know you were mine,</i>

411
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:41,425
<i>which life will never grant me.</i>

412
00:46:43,883 --> 00:46:47,217
<i>Believe me, Rosalia.
I'm afraid I'll lose my faith.</i>

413
00:46:47,383 --> 00:46:48,883
<i>No, I'm not blaspheming.</i>

414
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:51,633
<i>But yesterday, when I saw you,
so beautiful and bold...</i>

415
00:46:51,758 --> 00:46:54,258
<i>Like a young pagan goddess...</i>

416
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:12,175
<i>Desert of El Alamein,
Saturday, May 29, 1942,</i>

417
00:47:12,258 --> 00:47:14,967
<i>20th year of the fascist era.</i>

418
00:47:15,258 --> 00:47:19,342
<i>Rosalia, I swear if I make it out 
of this hell alive,</i>

419
00:47:19,467 --> 00:47:23,883
<i>if this rotten war spares me
and I make it back,</i>

420
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:26,008
<i>you'll be mine forever.</i>

421
00:47:27,383 --> 00:47:31,467
<i>Carmelo Patanè. Of course!
Declared missing in Africa.</i>

422
00:47:31,633 --> 00:47:35,383
<i>He was even listed on the monument
to the fallen in the piazza,</i>

423
00:47:35,467 --> 00:47:37,508
<i>but his name was later removed.</i>

424
00:47:37,592 --> 00:47:40,425
<i>Carmelo Patanè, godson of the old priest.</i>

425
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,675
<i>Tramp!</i>

426
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,717
Good morning.

427
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:23,842
- The service is over.
- But I just saw someone go in.

428
00:48:23,925 --> 00:48:29,342
A painter restoring some works of art.
But if it's urgent, I suppose...

429
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:31,425
Just a few minutes. A quick visit.

430
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,092
Go ahead.

431
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:58,383
That section was completely ruined.

432
00:49:03,383 --> 00:49:05,550
Look, Don Ferdinando.
That rosette merits restoring.

433
00:49:10,258 --> 00:49:11,967
And look over there.

434
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:19,800
- He's quite good.
- Yes, he's very good.

435
00:49:28,175 --> 00:49:31,633
<i>By flattering Patanè's silly vanity,</i>

436
00:49:31,758 --> 00:49:33,717
<i>it was easy to lure him to my house</i>

437
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:35,925
<i>on the pretext of requesting
his expert advice</i>

438
00:49:36,092 --> 00:49:39,425
<i>on some crusty old frescoes
on the living room ceiling.</i>

439
00:49:43,008 --> 00:49:45,633
Just as I suspected.

440
00:49:46,342 --> 00:49:50,508
Some ignorant 19th-century iconoclast,
with a view to...

441
00:49:50,592 --> 00:49:53,717
How can I say... improving his abode,

442
00:49:53,842 --> 00:49:59,758
had someone paint over
the original 17th-century decorations

443
00:49:59,883 --> 00:50:03,092
with these... if you'll forgive me...

444
00:50:03,258 --> 00:50:09,675
These absurd and quite revolting
scenes of hunting and feasting.

445
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,300
Yes, that makes sense.

446
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:16,175
They say the Cefalùs were
avid hunters, avid eaters,

447
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:18,425
and avid... well, just avid.

448
00:50:19,008 --> 00:50:23,258
With all due respect, Baron, it was
sacrilegious on your ancestors' part.

449
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:25,550
- I hope it can be fixed.
- Perhaps.

450
00:50:25,633 --> 00:50:27,758
You've gone mad, Fefè. It's all junk!

451
00:50:27,883 --> 00:50:31,050
No. Actually, I had in mind...

452
00:50:31,133 --> 00:50:35,175
I mean, if he thinks it's worth it.
- Well, it's a matter of...

453
00:50:43,758 --> 00:50:45,467
Pardon me.

454
00:50:50,425 --> 00:50:54,967
As I was saying.
They would be of great value,

455
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:56,717
if properly restored.

456
00:50:57,842 --> 00:50:59,425
<i>Idiot!</i>

457
00:51:00,092 --> 00:51:03,550
<i>But they had pretended
not to know each other.</i>

458
00:51:04,592 --> 00:51:07,592
<i>Perhaps the time had come
for me to make up with Rosalia.</i>

459
00:51:30,092 --> 00:51:31,717
<i>Come in.</i>

460
00:51:37,133 --> 00:51:40,300
Rosalia, it's me. I'm sorry.

461
00:52:20,425 --> 00:52:23,133
Forgive me. Be patient with me.

462
00:52:42,967 --> 00:52:46,592
You really must excuse me.
I have a terrible headache.

463
00:52:46,717 --> 00:52:50,092
Oh, I'm sorry. Just a kiss, then.

464
00:52:51,258 --> 00:52:53,050
Good night.

465
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:56,467
<i>Carmelo is fine.</i>

466
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,758
<i>Perfect.</i>

467
00:53:07,675 --> 00:53:12,133
<i>The next day, on the pretext
of taking care of some old taxes,</i>

468
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:14,092
<i>I went to Catania.</i>

469
00:53:14,217 --> 00:53:17,300
<i>I was dying to see Angela.</i>

470
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:18,925
<i>I also had to make a very 
important purchase.</i>

471
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,175
Let's try recording something.

472
00:53:21,258 --> 00:53:23,550
- Say something.
- I don't know what to say.

473
00:53:23,675 --> 00:53:26,008
The first thing that comes to mind.

474
00:53:26,133 --> 00:53:27,883
Go ahead!

475
00:53:28,092 --> 00:53:32,217
- Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury.
- You're not a lawyer, are you?

476
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:35,675
Now listen to this gem. It's perfect.

477
00:53:35,967 --> 00:53:37,342
Just listen.

478
00:53:45,217 --> 00:53:46,717
Perfect, isn't it?

479
00:54:02,883 --> 00:54:03,842
Waiter.

480
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,633
Take a nice bottle of wine
to the attorney.

481
00:54:10,467 --> 00:54:14,050
<i>Fate seemed to lay one favorable sign
after another at my feet.</i>

482
00:54:14,175 --> 00:54:18,050
<i>"Your Honor, gentlemen of the jury".</i>

483
00:54:30,258 --> 00:54:31,717
Thank you, my friend!

484
00:54:36,925 --> 00:54:38,258
<i>What a nice man.</i>

485
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,717
<i>What a great face.</i>

486
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,883
<i>So handsome.</i>

487
00:54:56,050 --> 00:54:58,217
Good day, my dear friend!

488
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:13,050
Sister.

489
00:55:16,092 --> 00:55:18,675
Angela, what an unexpected pleasure.

490
00:55:20,758 --> 00:55:23,383
How are you? You've grown.

491
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,217
A terrible thing has happened.

492
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,675
Papa was here yesterday.
I wrote you a letter.

493
00:55:27,758 --> 00:55:29,883
Good morning, Sister.

494
00:55:30,008 --> 00:55:32,925
- Mother, this is my uncle.
- I'm her mother's brother. May I...

495
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:35,217
I'm sorry, but not in public.

496
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,758
Come to the institute
Sundays or Thursdays.

497
00:55:37,883 --> 00:55:39,175
Let's go.

498
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:41,717
In line, girls. Move!

499
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Is she studying hard?

500
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:59,383
Sisina? Is there any mail?

501
00:56:04,925 --> 00:56:06,592
Mama! Rosalia!

502
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,592
Where is everybody?

503
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,217
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

504
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,092
Don Ferdinando, despite how it looks...

505
00:56:20,258 --> 00:56:22,633
- Is nobody home today?
- They're all at Aunt Fifidda's.

506
00:56:22,758 --> 00:56:24,717
- They've been fighting all day.
- Why?

507
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,675
<i>She's my sister, you understand?
Keep your hands off her!</i>

508
00:56:30,758 --> 00:56:32,675
She's my wife too. And she's killing me!

509
00:56:32,758 --> 00:56:34,383
I'll do as I please in my house.

510
00:56:34,508 --> 00:56:37,467
It'll be yours when you pay for it.
Scoundrel!

511
00:56:41,425 --> 00:56:44,508
As long as I'm here it's mine.
And I'll do as I like.

512
00:56:44,592 --> 00:56:46,175
I'll take care of my own affairs.

513
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:49,217
I decide about my daughter's life!

514
00:56:49,342 --> 00:56:53,258
You're a greedy scoundrel!
You want to marry her off for money!

515
00:56:53,383 --> 00:56:55,633
His own daughter! Disgusting!

516
00:56:55,758 --> 00:56:57,842
- Coward!
- Money grabber!

517
00:56:57,967 --> 00:56:59,800
You're just a coward!

518
00:57:14,508 --> 00:57:18,133
<i>But I'll be yours or no one's.</i>

519
00:57:19,008 --> 00:57:21,175
<i>Ferdinando, my beloved.</i>

520
00:57:22,758 --> 00:57:28,133
<i>If our love cannot be,
no other will ever take its place.</i>

521
00:57:30,383 --> 00:57:34,300
<i>In my heart I'll always be yours.</i>

522
00:57:35,092 --> 00:57:37,342
<i>I'll pray for you as long as I live.</i>

523
00:59:41,258 --> 00:59:44,175
<i>Who, gentlemen of the jury,</i>

524
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:46,508
<i>in this rapid summary of the facts,</i>

525
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:50,883
<i>could even vaguely imagine
the horror caused</i>

526
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:54,925
<i>by the spectacle of the two 
lovers lying there,</i>

527
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:59,217
<i>disgustingly entwined in the 
vile enactment of their sin.</i>

528
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:02,592
<i>There, on the couch,
in his very own house!</i>

529
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:08,300
<i>He was shocked.
He searched for an explanation.</i>

530
01:00:08,383 --> 01:00:13,508
<i>Perhaps he hoped for a miracle
to erase the sight from his eyes!</i>

531
01:00:13,592 --> 01:00:16,050
<i>Or perhaps he searched for words...</i>

532
01:00:16,217 --> 01:00:20,092
<i>Words that could express his pain.</i>

533
01:00:21,342 --> 01:00:23,758
<i>Instead, he found a weapon.</i>

534
01:00:23,883 --> 01:00:29,092
<i>An old pistol, forgotten for who knows
how long in some side table...</i>

535
01:00:36,925 --> 01:00:39,008
<i>Instead, he found a weapon.</i>

536
01:00:39,175 --> 01:00:42,800
<i>An old pistol,
forgotten for who knows how long</i>

537
01:00:42,925 --> 01:00:45,217
<i>in an old rococo credenza</i>

538
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:49,217
<i>of 18th-century Neapolitan design,
perhaps rebuilt in the 19th.</i>

539
01:01:02,008 --> 01:01:06,925
<i>Carmelo Patanè began work
at 10:00 a.m. on July 12.</i>

540
01:01:07,258 --> 01:01:10,092
<i>It felt almost like a solemn ceremony,</i>

541
01:01:10,217 --> 01:01:12,550
<i>with her, him and me,</i>

542
01:01:12,717 --> 01:01:14,717
<i>all of us very excited but restrained.</i>

543
01:01:14,883 --> 01:01:17,050
<i>And Sisina was there, too.</i>

544
01:01:26,592 --> 01:01:30,592
Well, I guess I'll put on my smock.

545
01:01:30,717 --> 01:01:33,217
Will you excuse me?

546
01:01:33,550 --> 01:01:36,883
Yes, but first drink your coffee.
Please sit down.

547
01:01:37,092 --> 01:01:38,383
Thank you. With pleasure.

548
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:42,717
- Sugar?
- Thank you.

549
01:01:42,842 --> 01:01:44,842
- One or two?
- Two.

550
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:50,258
- Would you like a pastry?
- No, thank you.

551
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:53,175
They're homemade. Very special.
My wife made them.

552
01:01:53,717 --> 01:01:55,842
In that case, I'd love one.

553
01:01:55,967 --> 01:01:57,092
Sisina, go on.

554
01:01:58,425 --> 01:02:00,008
Get going.

555
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:34,217
Well, I'll excuse myself.

556
01:02:34,550 --> 01:02:36,675
Please finish your coffee.

557
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:39,217
Besides, you haven't had your pastry.
Excuse me.

558
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:45,592
You're looking well, Rosalia.

559
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:49,175
So are you, Carmelo.

560
01:03:57,342 --> 01:03:59,842
<i>It's been so long.</i>

561
01:03:59,925 --> 01:04:02,842
<i>Yes, it has.</i>

562
01:04:03,842 --> 01:04:05,467
BARON CEFALÙ, OPEN YOUR EYES!

563
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,133
YOUR WIFE IS CHEATING ON YOU
UNDER YOUR VERY OWN ROOF!

564
01:04:08,342 --> 01:04:09,467
A FRIEND.

565
01:04:35,258 --> 01:04:38,592
<i>Premature, I know.
But I was hoping for the best.</i>

566
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:46,675
<i>Patanè was a very shy man.</i>

567
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,717
<i>And Rosalia was disgustingly faithful.</i>

568
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:52,300
<i>In three meetings,
nothing at all had happened.</i>

569
01:04:52,592 --> 01:04:54,467
<i>Or practically nothing.</i>

570
01:05:14,842 --> 01:05:18,592
<i>You know, I'd like to...
Perhaps I'm being foolish.</i>

571
01:05:18,717 --> 01:05:22,883
<i>Perhaps I could... I don't know...
help you a little.</i>

572
01:05:22,967 --> 01:05:25,300
<i>You could help me a lot, Rosalia.</i>

573
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,008
<i>But please understand:</i>

574
01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:29,675
<i>Just as friends.</i>

575
01:05:29,967 --> 01:05:33,883
<i>I'd like to sit here and watch
while you work.</i>

576
01:05:34,592 --> 01:05:36,675
<i>Why that sad look now?</i>

577
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,258
<i>It's nothing.</i>

578
01:05:44,467 --> 01:05:45,967
<i>Yes, Rosalia.</i>

579
01:05:46,092 --> 01:05:51,550
<i>The tempera mixture
with the water color and the oil-</i>

580
01:05:57,258 --> 01:05:58,508
<i>Why are you laughing?</i>

581
01:05:58,717 --> 01:06:01,675
<i>Please, don't laugh.
You're driving me mad.</i>

582
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,133
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

583
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:06,383
<i>Won't you forgive me?</i>

584
01:06:06,467 --> 01:06:08,717
<i>I'd better not come here anymore.</i>

585
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:10,467
<i>Believe me, it's better.</i>

586
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:46,092
Sisina, take this plate away.

587
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,342
<i>Nothing concrete happened
that day either.</i>

588
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:57,050
<i>But Rosalia had changed.</i>

589
01:06:57,383 --> 01:07:00,217
<i>She was especially kind to me,</i>

590
01:07:00,467 --> 01:07:03,425
<i>almost as if already asking</i>

591
01:07:03,675 --> 01:07:05,092
<i>forgiveness for something.</i>

592
01:07:09,342 --> 01:07:11,758
Rosalia, the head.

593
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:14,092
No, thank you. I don't feel like it.

594
01:07:14,425 --> 01:07:16,592
Too bad. You like it so much.

595
01:07:16,717 --> 01:07:18,633
Aren't you feeling well?

596
01:07:18,925 --> 01:07:21,425
<i>Rosalia saying no to a fish head?</i>

597
01:07:21,717 --> 01:07:24,342
<i>A sign of definite progress!</i>

598
01:07:45,717 --> 01:07:47,383
Does your head still hurt?

599
01:07:48,008 --> 01:07:51,508
The doctor says this migraine
could become chronic.

600
01:07:51,842 --> 01:07:53,842
Too bad. Good night.

601
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:01,883
<i>This is good, very good.
But be careful.</i>

602
01:08:01,967 --> 01:08:06,008
<i>Mustn't appear too resigned.
I'll let out a sigh.</i>

603
01:08:09,258 --> 01:08:13,425
- I'm sorry, Fefè.
- It's all right. Sleep.

604
01:08:18,217 --> 01:08:19,967
It's so hot today,

605
01:08:20,050 --> 01:08:22,592
but it's nice and cool in here.

606
01:08:23,592 --> 01:08:25,258
Why do you look at me like that?

607
01:08:28,717 --> 01:08:32,550
I'd like to paint your portrait one day.

608
01:08:33,425 --> 01:08:37,050
<i>Paint you as a madonna.</i>

609
01:08:38,258 --> 01:08:41,050
Or a harem girl.

610
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:48,175
Have you never painted me
from memory?

611
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:51,300
<i>Yes, a thousand times.
Everywhere I go.</i>

612
01:08:52,383 --> 01:08:55,508
During these long years,
no matter where I was.

613
01:08:56,883 --> 01:09:00,175
I even made a quick sketch of you
at Eptismania,

614
01:09:00,425 --> 01:09:02,383
on a Corinthian capitol, I remember.

615
01:09:02,508 --> 01:09:04,300
<i>All over the place, really:</i>

616
01:09:04,425 --> 01:09:08,133
<i>On marble tabletops,
in coffee shops and bars.</i>

617
01:09:08,217 --> 01:09:12,883
I did one in Panarea,
where I get away now and then.

618
01:09:13,008 --> 01:09:17,050
<i>It's still there,
in an old fisherman's hut.</i>

619
01:09:17,175 --> 01:09:18,758
Do you know Panarea?

620
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:20,550
No. Is it pretty?

621
01:09:20,633 --> 01:09:22,925
Sea. Rocks. Nature.

622
01:09:24,508 --> 01:09:27,217
I'd love to see those portraits.

623
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:29,675
A journey back in time.

624
01:09:29,967 --> 01:09:32,342
In search of lost dreams.

625
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:36,383
<i>I beg of you, Carmelo.</i>

626
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,592
Who is it?

627
01:09:42,342 --> 01:09:43,967
I've brought you some lemonade.

628
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,175
Good.

629
01:09:47,258 --> 01:09:50,133
That idiot's always in the way!

630
01:09:57,050 --> 01:09:58,592
Warm, isn't it?

631
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,217
I imagine everyone's asleep.

632
01:10:01,383 --> 01:10:04,217
<i>The baron and baroness
are sleeping, aren't they?</i>

633
01:10:05,050 --> 01:10:06,425
At this hour everyone's asleep.

634
01:10:06,592 --> 01:10:08,925
- Good.
- Except me.

635
01:10:11,883 --> 01:10:14,925
- Don't you ever nap after lunch?
- Never.

636
01:10:15,550 --> 01:10:17,717
I used to, once in a while,

637
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:19,800
after straightening up the kitchen.

638
01:10:20,342 --> 01:10:21,717
But now...

639
01:10:22,758 --> 01:10:23,717
Now?

640
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:27,008
I can't sleep anymore...

641
01:10:28,133 --> 01:10:29,633
even at night.

642
01:10:35,133 --> 01:10:36,550
<i>Let me look at you.</i>

643
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:40,758
Antonello da Messina.

644
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:49,050
Those adolescent martyrs
typical of Antonello.

645
01:10:49,133 --> 01:10:51,675
<i>Come on. Hold still.</i>

646
01:10:51,758 --> 01:10:55,717
Is that scoundrel trying
to corrupt my servant?

647
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,175
I'd like to paint your portrait someday.

648
01:11:00,383 --> 01:11:03,133
Sisina, go to the drugstore
and get me some aspirin.

649
01:11:09,592 --> 01:11:11,925
How's the work going, Professor?

650
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:14,175
It's going well. Not bad.

651
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:17,550
Good. Keep it up.

652
01:11:17,633 --> 01:11:19,383
Thank you, Baron. Thank you.

653
01:11:32,758 --> 01:11:35,925
- In the name of the Father...
- Father, I've committed a grave sin.

654
01:11:36,050 --> 01:11:37,592
And the Holy Ghost.

655
01:11:38,342 --> 01:11:40,633
Now, who is he?

656
01:11:41,092 --> 01:11:44,633
Father, do you know Antonello?

657
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,508
Antonello who?

658
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:48,675
No, must not be from this parish.

659
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:50,883
No, Father. He's from Messina.

660
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:54,383
You had to go all that way
to get into trouble?

661
01:11:54,717 --> 01:11:58,550
- No, Father, I don't know him.
- So who is this Antonio?

662
01:11:58,633 --> 01:12:00,300
Antonello.

663
01:12:00,467 --> 01:12:03,800
No, the professor mentioned him to me.

664
01:12:03,883 --> 01:12:05,092
What professor?

665
01:12:05,383 --> 01:12:07,675
Don Carmelino, your godson.

666
01:12:07,758 --> 01:12:10,342
Let me see if I understand.
"He" is Carmelino?

667
01:12:10,425 --> 01:12:11,675
Yes, Father.

668
01:12:11,758 --> 01:12:15,550
You wretched girl!
He's married, with three kids!

669
01:12:17,383 --> 01:12:19,883
Why weren't you wearing a ring?

670
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,550
Impostor!

671
01:12:21,883 --> 01:12:24,883
Calm down, Sisina. Stop shouting.

672
01:12:25,633 --> 01:12:29,008
I don't wear a ring because it's 
unfashionable in the city.

673
01:12:29,592 --> 01:12:34,133
If you're married you should wear a ring.
How's a girl to know?

674
01:12:34,217 --> 01:12:35,342
Calm down.

675
01:12:35,467 --> 01:12:37,217
<i>Don't yell, Sisina.</i>

676
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,342
<i>Calm down, please.</i>

677
01:12:41,883 --> 01:12:45,133
<i>Married with three children.
Keep calm.</i>

678
01:12:46,050 --> 01:12:49,300
<i>Let's consider things
in light of these new developments.</i>

679
01:12:49,758 --> 01:12:52,717
<i>He knows that the servant knows,
therefore he's nervous.</i>

680
01:12:52,842 --> 01:12:54,175
<i>Let's see.</i>

681
01:12:54,883 --> 01:12:57,592
<i>Let me put myself in his shoes 
for a moment.</i>

682
01:12:57,842 --> 01:12:59,717
<i>Just for a moment.</i>

683
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,550
I have to tell you something right now.

684
01:13:07,050 --> 01:13:10,508
I've hesitated to tell you.
But it's very important.

685
01:13:14,550 --> 01:13:16,675
What is it? Are you ill?

686
01:13:16,883 --> 01:13:19,383
Come, lie down on the couch.

687
01:13:21,842 --> 01:13:24,550
Rosalia, I'm unworthy of your love.
I've lied to you.

688
01:13:24,717 --> 01:13:27,050
I let you think I was a free man.

689
01:13:30,342 --> 01:13:32,717
I'm not single, Rosalia.

690
01:13:33,092 --> 01:13:34,883
I'm married just like you.

691
01:13:35,175 --> 01:13:38,883
I've betrayed the solemn oath
I took 12 years ago.

692
01:13:39,717 --> 01:13:41,092
Forgive me.

693
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:44,675
But the man you see before you
is still the loneliest man alive.

694
01:13:44,883 --> 01:13:46,508
I swear it!

695
01:13:47,550 --> 01:13:49,883
My poor Carmelino.

696
01:14:00,383 --> 01:14:01,633
<i>My love!</i>

697
01:14:03,842 --> 01:14:05,342
Yes, Papa.

698
01:14:05,967 --> 01:14:07,592
<i>Is someone in there with you?</i>

699
01:14:08,425 --> 01:14:11,467
No. Why would anyone be in here with me?

700
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,175
I thought I heard...

701
01:14:13,258 --> 01:14:15,717
Go to bed, Papa. Sleep well.

702
01:14:40,633 --> 01:14:42,258
Damn it.

703
01:15:01,342 --> 01:15:04,133
Matilde. Donna Rosalia. Baron.

704
01:15:04,717 --> 01:15:06,050
Good-bye once again.

705
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:55,342
<i>My love!</i>

706
01:15:57,592 --> 01:16:00,050
No, don't go! Come here.

707
01:16:00,133 --> 01:16:01,675
<i>I love you!</i>

708
01:16:01,717 --> 01:16:03,842
You're mine.

709
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:06,883
Nothing in this world can stop our love.

710
01:16:09,050 --> 01:16:11,467
You and I are alone. Alone!

711
01:16:11,550 --> 01:16:14,842
We've waited 12 years for this 
moment without knowing it.

712
01:16:15,217 --> 01:16:16,592
- Admit it.
- Yes!

713
01:16:16,717 --> 01:16:18,342
Well, then? My life!

714
01:16:20,217 --> 01:16:22,592
<i>Not like this. Tomorrow.</i>

715
01:16:22,592 --> 01:16:25,592
Tomorrow. But first promise me something.

716
01:16:26,092 --> 01:16:29,550
Anything at all. But why tomorrow?

717
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:31,842
Tomorrow is Thursday, isn't it?

718
01:16:32,467 --> 01:16:35,050
I was thinking that tomorrow...

719
01:16:45,342 --> 01:16:48,092
<i>Tomorrow... a promise.</i>

720
01:16:49,217 --> 01:16:52,842
<i>What promise? And why tomorrow?</i>

721
01:16:53,217 --> 01:16:55,508
TOMORROW

722
01:16:55,592 --> 01:16:57,383
TODAY

723
01:16:59,217 --> 01:17:03,633
<i>Preceded by scandal, controversy,
protest, critical outcry and hosannas,</i>

724
01:17:03,717 --> 01:17:06,425
<i>a sensational film had opened in town.</i>

725
01:17:07,133 --> 01:17:10,175
<i>The priest of San Filmino
railed against it,</i>

726
01:17:10,300 --> 01:17:12,925
<i>warning his flock to boycott it,</i>

727
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:14,925
<i>but to little effect.</i>

728
01:17:15,050 --> 01:17:17,217
Orgies worthy of Tiberius!

729
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:20,842
Wife-swapping! Striptease!
Let's go, guys!

730
01:17:25,008 --> 01:17:27,467
<i>We'd never seen anything like it.</i>

731
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:30,217
<i>Not even all the chairs from the bar
piled into the theater</i>

732
01:17:30,342 --> 01:17:33,592
<i>could hold the huge audience
that assembled.</i>

733
01:17:35,092 --> 01:17:36,925
<i>They even came from the countryside,</i>

734
01:17:37,050 --> 01:17:39,717
<i>riding for miles on horseback,</i>

735
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:43,467
<i>making the gentlemen of Agramonte
anxious for their wives' virtue.</i>

736
01:17:43,925 --> 01:17:47,008
<i>Finally, Don Ciccio Matara took over
organization of the event,</i>

737
01:17:47,133 --> 01:17:50,092
<i>and with great efficiency,
I might add.</i>

738
01:17:50,217 --> 01:17:54,050
Papa, three hours locked up
with all those people?

739
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:56,550
I just couldn't bear it.

740
01:17:57,217 --> 01:17:59,425
Have you really got another headache?

741
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:03,092
Then I'll stay home too.
- No, there's no need.

742
01:18:03,425 --> 01:18:05,925
I'll just take an aspirin
and go to bed.

743
01:18:06,050 --> 01:18:07,758
You go ahead.

744
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,467
Oh, what a headache.

745
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:14,300
- Pickles get you too excited.
- And you should know.

746
01:18:14,383 --> 01:18:16,508
The older you get,
the dirtier your mind gets!

747
01:18:16,633 --> 01:18:19,217
Sisina, take these away.

748
01:18:19,342 --> 01:18:22,842
Leave your door open tonight
and I'll tell you all about the movie.

749
01:18:23,133 --> 01:18:25,425
Let's go, Gaetano.

750
01:18:25,842 --> 01:18:27,467
Good-bye, Rosalia.

751
01:18:29,342 --> 01:18:30,883
Good evening, Baroness.

752
01:18:31,633 --> 01:18:35,258
Did you ask Sisina to stay home
and keep you company?

753
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:37,800
No, I'd rather she didn't.

754
01:18:38,092 --> 01:18:40,592
But the idiot says she's made 
some kind of vow.

755
01:18:41,175 --> 01:18:44,300
- Minors under 16 can't get in anyway.
- That's right.

756
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:47,467
- Take care of yourself, okay?
- Yes, dear.

757
01:18:47,550 --> 01:18:48,883
Good night.

758
01:18:49,008 --> 01:18:51,508
And have a good time.

759
01:19:01,967 --> 01:19:03,008
I'm coming.

760
01:19:03,133 --> 01:19:04,550
<i>Let's go, Fefè!</i>

761
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:06,633
My cigarettes.

762
01:19:21,175 --> 01:19:25,175
<i>It has to happen here.
Not in our room.</i>

763
01:19:25,258 --> 01:19:27,425
<i>She wouldn't be capable of that.</i>

764
01:20:45,175 --> 01:20:47,383
A great-looking specimen.

765
01:20:47,675 --> 01:20:49,758
But I can tell she has no soul.

766
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:29,133
<i>The odious images conjured up
by that anonymous letter tormented him.</i>

767
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,717
<i>With great reluctance,
he gave in to the impulse</i>

768
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:33,592
<i>to run home and see for himself.</i>

769
01:21:33,717 --> 01:21:37,383
<i>Though he felt it too insulting
to his beloved life companion,</i>

770
01:21:37,508 --> 01:21:41,633
<i>a gnawing suspicion had taken 
hold of his tortured mind.</i>

771
01:21:41,717 --> 01:21:46,175
<i>His hesitant and uncertain steps led him
along the fateful path to his home,</i>

772
01:21:46,300 --> 01:21:50,717
<i>where all seemed normal,
tranquil and peaceful.</i>

773
01:21:51,008 --> 01:21:54,217
<i>What if he's already inside?
Those snakes!</i>

774
01:22:02,092 --> 01:22:03,758
<i>Good heavens! Where's she going?</i>

775
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:08,342
<i>And why does she have a suitcase?</i>

776
01:22:10,675 --> 01:22:12,467
<i>The 9:43 train!</i>

777
01:22:13,217 --> 01:22:14,508
<i>The gun!</i>

778
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:16,467
<i>Curse them!</i>

779
01:22:19,675 --> 01:22:20,883
<i>To the station!</i>

780
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:23,592
<i>I could catch them
with suitcases at the station.</i>

781
01:22:23,717 --> 01:22:25,592
<i>That could count as catching 
them in the act.</i>

782
01:22:25,717 --> 01:22:28,175
<i>It has to count. It has to!</i>

783
01:22:28,592 --> 01:22:32,092
<i>He'd found the house empty,
the nest deserted.</i>

784
01:22:32,217 --> 01:22:36,508
<i>Overtaken by a natural impulse
for revenge, he ran like a madman</i>

785
01:22:36,592 --> 01:22:39,383
<i>toward the station.
Faster and faster. On and on!</i>

786
01:22:39,508 --> 01:22:41,508
<i>To kill... perhaps.</i>

787
01:22:41,592 --> 01:22:45,300
<i>But perhaps also in desperate hope
of catching his unfaithful spouse</i>

788
01:22:45,383 --> 01:22:47,717
<i>and stopping her from leaving.
Who knows?</i>

789
01:22:49,342 --> 01:22:52,300
<i>But when he saw them there together,</i>

790
01:22:52,425 --> 01:22:54,508
<i>her and her lover...</i>

791
01:22:57,175 --> 01:23:01,217
<i>The 9:43 train. Right on time.</i>

792
01:23:01,717 --> 01:23:02,633
<i>Curse them!</i>

793
01:23:08,425 --> 01:23:11,592
<i>The next day, a sleepy calm
reigned in Agramonte,</i>

794
01:23:11,717 --> 01:23:13,342
<i>as if nothing had happened.</i>

795
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:17,342
<i>The adulterers' elopement
had unhinged part of my plan.</i>

796
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:20,550
<i>"He who causes the death
of spouse, daughter or sister,</i>

797
01:23:20,633 --> 01:23:23,217
<i>upon discovering her
in illegitimate carnal relations,</i>

798
01:23:23,342 --> 01:23:26,717
<i>and in the heat of passion caused
by the offense to his honor, etc."</i>

799
01:23:26,883 --> 01:23:30,133
<i>The law was exceptionally clear
on this matter.</i>

800
01:23:30,342 --> 01:23:33,800
<i>"Heat of passion" equals "catching them
in the act" plus "offended honor".</i>

801
01:23:34,133 --> 01:23:36,800
<i>Therefore, having failed
to catch them in the act,</i>

802
01:23:36,883 --> 01:23:39,217
<i>I'd have to lay it on thick
with the offended honor,</i>

803
01:23:39,342 --> 01:23:43,717
<i>so the heat of passion could reach
the intensity required by the law.</i>

804
01:23:44,383 --> 01:23:48,925
<i>I then remembered a few tricks
I'd learned in the military.</i>

805
01:23:56,592 --> 01:23:58,092
104.

806
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:08,633
Why?

807
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:12,883
Why did you abandon me?

808
01:24:20,092 --> 01:24:23,008
<i>Dr. Talamone was the biggest 
gossip in town.</i>

809
01:24:23,342 --> 01:24:26,342
<i>Public opinion held my stock
in a definite decline.</i>

810
01:24:26,425 --> 01:24:28,258
<i>In fact, it took a nosedive.</i>

811
01:24:41,633 --> 01:24:43,633
<i>My friends from the social club</i>

812
01:24:43,717 --> 01:24:47,800
<i>at first adopted an attitude
of pained and vivid compassion.</i>

813
01:24:48,008 --> 01:24:49,675
<i>But only at first.</i>

814
01:25:23,258 --> 01:25:25,925
He's locked himself in there
since that tragic day.

815
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:30,300
He won't see anyone or eat anything.
My poor son.

816
01:25:37,092 --> 01:25:40,883
<i>If this man had discovered his wife
in flagrant adultery,</i>

817
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:44,925
<i>then yes, gentlemen of the jury,
he might have killed.</i>

818
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:47,717
<i>But not after the fact.
Not in cold blood.</i>

819
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,883
<i>He couldn't give chase
to the adulterers</i>

820
01:25:51,092 --> 01:25:53,175
<i>inflamed with hatred.</i>

821
01:25:53,383 --> 01:25:55,342
<i>No, gentlemen of the court.</i>

822
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:58,175
<i>He lay there</i>

823
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:02,050
<i>in a state of dumb despondency
that numbed his senses.</i>

824
01:26:02,217 --> 01:26:06,800
<i>Fefè, eat something for your mama.</i>

825
01:26:07,092 --> 01:26:09,383
No, go away.

826
01:26:09,883 --> 01:26:11,800
Leave me alone.

827
01:26:16,925 --> 01:26:20,383
<i>Meanwhile, rumors spread
through town like an oil spill.</i>

828
01:26:20,508 --> 01:26:22,008
<i>All sorts of things were said,</i>

829
01:26:22,175 --> 01:26:25,550
<i>the substance of which
could be summed up a single word:</i>

830
01:26:25,633 --> 01:26:27,175
<i>Cuckold.</i>

831
01:26:31,258 --> 01:26:35,133
Now we see the results of such 
shameless pictures.

832
01:26:35,467 --> 01:26:38,092
Unworthy mystifications of art,

833
01:26:38,217 --> 01:26:43,175
that flaunt and exalt sin.
Debauchery and immorality.

834
01:26:47,258 --> 01:26:51,508
It's a point of fact that historically,
even here in the south,

835
01:26:51,592 --> 01:26:55,050
which I'm pleased to visit for 
the first time,

836
01:26:55,217 --> 01:26:58,508
the moment's come to face the age-old
problem of women's emancipation

837
01:26:58,592 --> 01:27:01,592
as it's been confronted
and solved, for example,

838
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:03,758
by our Chinese brothers.

839
01:27:03,883 --> 01:27:08,508
Therefore, I invite you to express
your democratic opinion on these facts.

840
01:27:08,592 --> 01:27:09,717
In other words,

841
01:27:09,842 --> 01:27:14,050
what is the calm, objective
judgment that Mrs. Cefalù deserves?

842
01:27:14,717 --> 01:27:16,717
Whore!

843
01:27:25,217 --> 01:27:27,883
<i>Finally, the anonymous letters began.</i>

844
01:27:28,592 --> 01:27:31,800
<i>In Agramonte the anonymous letter
is a prized handicraft.</i>

845
01:27:32,175 --> 01:27:34,758
<i>We start practicing as children
on sheets torn from notebooks,</i>

846
01:27:34,883 --> 01:27:37,842
<i>graduating to polished specimens
forged by expert adult hands.</i>

847
01:27:38,258 --> 01:27:41,050
<i>In this orgy of accusation,
mockery and defamation,</i>

848
01:27:41,133 --> 01:27:42,967
<i>we'd all been lumped together.</i>

849
01:27:43,175 --> 01:27:47,800
<i>Not only had I been dishonored,
but the entire Cefalù household:</i>

850
01:27:47,883 --> 01:27:51,467
<i>Living members, future descendants,
and anyone associated with us.</i>

851
01:27:51,550 --> 01:27:56,175
<i>Even future generations
in any way related to the Cefalù name</i>

852
01:27:56,383 --> 01:27:59,383
<i>saw their very existence threatened.</i>

853
01:27:59,467 --> 01:28:02,675
<i>In short, everyone was brought into it,
without exception,</i>

854
01:28:02,758 --> 01:28:04,217
<i>including the servants.</i>

855
01:28:05,550 --> 01:28:09,508
<i>But for me, those letters
were worth their weight in gold.</i>

856
01:28:09,842 --> 01:28:13,050
<i>I cataloged them
in the most meticulous fashion.</i>

857
01:28:14,925 --> 01:28:16,717
"Cuckold".

858
01:28:23,217 --> 01:28:25,008
"Cuckold". Good.

859
01:28:29,383 --> 01:28:31,508
"We stand behind you".

860
01:28:38,550 --> 01:28:40,092
<i>"Mulè and Sons regrets..."</i>

861
01:28:40,217 --> 01:28:42,842
I'll let him know he's a coward!

862
01:28:44,008 --> 01:28:46,550
- Coward!
- Calm down.

863
01:28:46,675 --> 01:28:48,800
Forget that gravedigger!

864
01:28:49,092 --> 01:28:51,508
No one will want his sister now!

865
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,967
He's dishonored us all!

866
01:28:54,258 --> 01:28:56,342
Coward!

867
01:28:58,883 --> 01:29:00,425
My son!

868
01:29:01,467 --> 01:29:03,883
- Rosario left you.
- Yes, he left me.

869
01:29:04,217 --> 01:29:05,592
Did he tell you in person?

870
01:29:05,883 --> 01:29:09,217
No, he sent this letter. Read it.

871
01:29:19,717 --> 01:29:23,175
I'm sorry, Agnesina. I'm really sorry.

872
01:29:27,842 --> 01:29:30,800
You're a cuckold, and proud of it!

873
01:29:35,883 --> 01:29:38,842
<i>Lower, ever lower.</i>

874
01:29:40,217 --> 01:29:44,717
<i>Let's sink into the mud
up to our necks.</i>

875
01:29:46,842 --> 01:29:49,342
<i>Everyone shunned him openly</i>

876
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:52,342
<i>because he'd been branded
by the most vile disgrace possible.</i>

877
01:29:56,550 --> 01:30:00,217
<i>I was a leper. I might as well
have had the plague,</i>

878
01:30:00,383 --> 01:30:02,883
<i>like a character
from a novel by Manzoni.</i>

879
01:30:13,592 --> 01:30:15,842
<i>Hear the latest news
on the cuckold front!</i>

880
01:30:18,717 --> 01:30:20,883
My respects, Don Ferdinando.

881
01:30:41,508 --> 01:30:42,967
<i>Interesting.</i>

882
01:30:43,092 --> 01:30:45,550
<i>Up until then, no one
had bothered telling me</i>

883
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:48,175
<i>where the hell the two runaways 
had holed up.</i>

884
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,508
<i>And this was rather annoying,
because I, the wounded party.</i>

885
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,717
<i>Couldn't go about openly 
gathering information.</i>

886
01:30:55,800 --> 01:30:58,217
<i>I was supposed to just suddenly
up and disappear.</i>

887
01:30:59,008 --> 01:31:02,508
<i>Don Ciccio Matara,
with his circle of mysterious friends,</i>

888
01:31:02,633 --> 01:31:04,425
<i>might be able to help me.</i>

889
01:31:05,008 --> 01:31:07,883
<i>But the initiative clearly
had to come from him.</i>

890
01:31:08,425 --> 01:31:13,883
<i>To be honest, that day I got the feeling
he might be leaning in that direction.</i>

891
01:31:25,133 --> 01:31:26,967
<i>Dear Papa and Mama,</i>

892
01:31:27,258 --> 01:31:32,425
<i>today I took my Latin exam,
and it went quite well.</i>

893
01:31:33,258 --> 01:31:35,383
"Dear Papa and Mama".

894
01:31:39,842 --> 01:31:41,133
That means...

895
01:31:45,217 --> 01:31:46,467
<i>Help!</i>

896
01:31:47,092 --> 01:31:49,133
<i>Matilde, help!</i>

897
01:31:50,717 --> 01:31:52,633
Calogero!

898
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:55,675
Help!

899
01:31:58,883 --> 01:32:00,050
Carmela!

900
01:32:02,217 --> 01:32:04,175
It's Calogero!

901
01:32:05,925 --> 01:32:08,675
Gaetano! Matilde!

902
01:32:11,092 --> 01:32:13,383
<i>Call the doctor, quick!</i>

903
01:32:22,300 --> 01:32:23,342
You slug!

904
01:32:24,342 --> 01:32:25,342
Me?

905
01:32:25,467 --> 01:32:26,842
Why?

906
01:32:44,717 --> 01:32:46,050
Holy Mother of God!

907
01:32:47,092 --> 01:32:49,383
Quick, a glass of water!

908
01:32:51,175 --> 01:32:54,092
- What is it?
- Something terrible's happened.

909
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:22,550
<i>Ferdinando, my love,</i>

910
01:33:22,675 --> 01:33:25,592
<i>a friend told me what happened to you.</i>

911
01:33:26,175 --> 01:33:30,550
<i>My love, I wish I were there
to share your every pain.</i>

912
01:33:30,633 --> 01:33:32,092
<i>But it can't be.</i>

913
01:33:32,550 --> 01:33:35,175
<i>Perhaps we're being punished
for our sin.</i>

914
01:33:35,550 --> 01:33:40,092
<i>Perhaps this is a sign our love 
will never be blessed.</i>

915
01:33:41,342 --> 01:33:46,550
<i>Forever yours no matter what happens... 
Angela.</i>

916
01:34:40,842 --> 01:34:42,217
What a tragedy.

917
01:34:42,550 --> 01:34:44,633
Poor guy's heart just gave out.

918
01:34:44,883 --> 01:34:46,717
But you mustn't take it too hard.

919
01:34:46,883 --> 01:34:51,467
We all knew Don Calogero had a 
heart condition.

920
01:34:52,717 --> 01:34:55,717
Now it's time for you
to make a move, Don Fefè.

921
01:34:55,842 --> 01:35:00,217
Your family was well respected.
The entire town is waiting.

922
01:35:00,342 --> 01:35:03,133
Couldn't you...
Do I make myself clear?

923
01:35:03,383 --> 01:35:06,092
We've called certain friends into action.

924
01:35:06,217 --> 01:35:07,717
Give me 24 hours.

925
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:11,092
We'll find out where they are.

926
01:35:23,883 --> 01:35:25,717
Have courage.

927
01:35:48,383 --> 01:35:50,883
Are you Baron Don Ferdinando Cefalù?

928
01:35:51,217 --> 01:35:52,675
My name is Immacolata Patanè.

929
01:35:54,592 --> 01:35:56,175
I'm his wife.

930
01:35:57,300 --> 01:36:01,050
I came all the way from Catania
to find out what you intend to do.

931
01:36:01,675 --> 01:36:03,300
I really don't...

932
01:36:14,967 --> 01:36:18,383
<i>Yes, now I'd been provoked.</i>

933
01:36:18,508 --> 01:36:21,467
<i>Gravely provoked, I might add.</i>

934
01:36:44,758 --> 01:36:48,842
<i>Don Ciccio Matara had kept his promise.</i>

935
01:37:26,967 --> 01:37:27,925
Immacolata!

936
01:37:54,883 --> 01:37:56,842
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

937
01:37:57,383 --> 01:37:58,883
I avenged my honor.

938
01:38:03,092 --> 01:38:04,675
But...

939
01:38:05,883 --> 01:38:07,967
What about mine?

940
01:38:43,842 --> 01:38:48,258
BARON CEFALÙ KILLS WIFE
CAUGHT HIDING OUT WITH LOVER

941
01:38:59,008 --> 01:39:04,342
<i>In this picturesque corner of Sicily,
many have died in the name of honor.</i>

942
01:39:05,133 --> 01:39:07,258
<i>Poor Rosalia, you didn't deserve it.</i>

943
01:39:07,592 --> 01:39:12,925
<i>But I know you rest in peace,
with your naïve little dreams.</i>

944
01:39:13,217 --> 01:39:16,467
<i>I really did love you in my own way.</i>

945
01:39:16,758 --> 01:39:19,175
<i>But you were too much.</i>

946
01:39:19,258 --> 01:39:21,842
<i>You would ask,
"How much do you love me?"</i>

947
01:39:22,133 --> 01:39:24,592
<i>You were hungry for love,
my poor Rosalia.</i>

948
01:39:24,883 --> 01:39:27,800
<i>Too hungry.</i>

949
01:39:29,883 --> 01:39:31,550
ONE LAW FOR ALL

950
01:39:31,842 --> 01:39:36,342
<i>There's not much to say about the trial.
It went much as I expected.</i>

951
01:39:36,883 --> 01:39:38,467
Gentlemen of the jury...

952
01:39:42,925 --> 01:39:46,717
<i>The attorney, De Marzi, was brilliant,
impassioned and sarcastic.</i>

953
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:48,092
<i>Moving and moved.</i>

954
01:39:48,217 --> 01:39:52,633
<i>He played the entire scale of emotions
with confident precision.</i>

955
01:39:52,883 --> 01:39:55,258
<i>He didn't go so far as to 
mention the Crusades,</i>

956
01:39:55,425 --> 01:39:58,300
<i>but he did cite Othello
and our countryman Turiddu.</i>

957
01:39:58,717 --> 01:39:59,925
<i>Mama was there.</i>

958
01:40:00,050 --> 01:40:02,717
<i>Crying, the poor soul.</i>

959
01:40:02,842 --> 01:40:06,633
<i>Yes, even I was close to tears.</i>

960
01:40:06,717 --> 01:40:08,550
<i>Then he brought my father into it:</i>

961
01:40:08,717 --> 01:40:10,758
<i>A debauched corrupter of innocents,</i>

962
01:40:10,883 --> 01:40:13,925
<i>undoubtedly infected with some 
unmentionable disease,</i>

963
01:40:14,050 --> 01:40:16,008
<i>producer of debts and bastards galore.</i>

964
01:40:16,092 --> 01:40:18,133
<i>Clearly, grave hereditary dysfunction</i>

965
01:40:18,217 --> 01:40:20,925
<i>could be added to my wounded honor.</i>

966
01:40:21,050 --> 01:40:23,258
<i>Finally, he produced the widow Patanè.</i>

967
01:40:23,550 --> 01:40:26,175
<i>He couldn't produce her children,
as they were still very young.</i>

968
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,467
<i>And the penal code forbade it.</i>

969
01:40:28,550 --> 01:40:30,133
<i>But he showed us their pictures.</i>

970
01:40:30,217 --> 01:40:33,675
<i>The image of those poor orphans
helped my case to no end.</i>

971
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:35,342
<i>I don't really know why.</i>

972
01:40:35,425 --> 01:40:37,508
<i>Perhaps because in Italy, children...</i>

973
01:40:38,217 --> 01:40:40,092
<i>Well, children will always be children.</i>

974
01:40:41,092 --> 01:40:43,258
Silence! His Honor is entering 
the courtroom.

975
01:40:53,925 --> 01:40:55,717
In the name of the Italian people...

976
01:40:57,050 --> 01:40:59,342
<i>Three years. The minimum.</i>

977
01:40:59,592 --> 01:41:03,175
<i>Actually, a little less than the minimum.
I received a small pardon.</i>

978
01:41:03,258 --> 01:41:06,550
<i>I won't say I'd predicted it,
but I was sort of counting on it.</i>

979
01:41:06,758 --> 01:41:10,217
<i>On average there's a pardon
every three years, so it was my due.</i>

980
01:41:11,092 --> 01:41:15,592
<i>I can't say it was a pleasant three years,
but it's behind me now.</i>

981
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:25,842
<i>I was suddenly seized by a strange fear.</i>

982
01:41:27,050 --> 01:41:30,133
- Waiter, take care of the bill.
- Thank you, sir.

983
01:41:32,758 --> 01:41:35,717
<i>During those months
I'd received letters from Angela.</i>

984
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,342
<i>But only a few.
And they were rather vague.</i>

985
01:41:38,467 --> 01:41:42,092
<i>She always said she prayed for me
and made constant vows.</i>

986
01:41:42,217 --> 01:41:46,050
<i>Perhaps it was the natural shyness
of our southern women.</i>

987
01:41:46,508 --> 01:41:47,717
<i>Or perhaps...</i>

988
01:41:47,925 --> 01:41:50,842
<i>No, it couldn't be.
That would be too unfair.</i>

989
01:41:56,967 --> 01:41:58,508
He's here!

990
01:42:02,050 --> 01:42:03,675
He's here!

991
01:42:25,550 --> 01:42:27,925
My beloved son!

992
01:43:26,383 --> 01:43:29,717
A FEW MONTHS LATER

993
01:44:05,092 --> 01:44:08,883
<i>Yes, life begins at 40.</i>

994
01:44:09,383 --> 01:44:11,300
<i>It really is true.</i>
