1
00:02:18,703 --> 00:02:20,275
David, look!

2
00:02:23,504 --> 00:02:24,911
Look at that.

3
00:02:24,935 --> 00:02:26,083
Look!

4
00:02:26,107 --> 00:02:27,541
Wheels.

5
00:02:27,679 --> 00:02:29,946
- Wheels?
- They are wheels.

6
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:31,395
It's like a big car.

7
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,261
OK!

8
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:01,925
OK!

9
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:05,077
Is that a house?

10
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,692
I don't see any houses.

11
00:03:06,716 --> 00:03:08,627
- Over there.
- Yeah.

12
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,795
David...

13
00:04:25,652 --> 00:04:27,466
Garden is small.

14
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,628
No.

15
00:04:30,426 --> 00:04:32,371
Garden of Eden is big.

16
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:34,350
Like this.

17
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:42,284
You OK?

18
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:04,063
Is the heart murmur getting louder?

19
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:56,814
Keep backing her
up, slow, slow now.

20
00:05:57,029 --> 00:05:59,182
And...

21
00:06:15,555 --> 00:06:17,396
Alright, listen up, everyone.

22
00:06:17,758 --> 00:06:20,036
Now, this here, is Mr Jacob

23
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,880
and Mrs Monica Yi.

24
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:24,720
Mr Yi is an expert chicken sexer

25
00:06:24,744 --> 00:06:28,113
has worked in California
and Seattle, so, uh...

26
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,212
let's give him a big Arkansas welcome.

27
00:06:34,298 --> 00:06:35,548
Fine.

28
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:38,638
OK, here we put the
males in the blue bin

29
00:06:38,662 --> 00:06:40,678
and the females in the white bin.

30
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:43,125
OK. Go work.

31
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:58,685
David.

32
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,089
OK,

33
00:07:02,113 --> 00:07:06,651
you read the E volume
and I'll read the C volume.

34
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,411
Mom, what can I do?

35
00:08:54,135 --> 00:08:55,342
It's good.

36
00:11:01,765 --> 00:11:03,432
Let's give them Mountain dew.

37
00:11:03,456 --> 00:11:06,147
No, I need water. OK?

38
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,177
OK!

39
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,128
Write it big.

40
00:12:28,966 --> 00:12:31,284
DON'T FIGHT.

41
00:14:15,456 --> 00:14:17,505
Oh, no.

42
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:48,329
My favourite.

43
00:14:48,797 --> 00:14:50,308
My favourite.

44
00:16:09,054 --> 00:16:11,589
Just set it down anywhere.

45
00:16:15,996 --> 00:16:18,358
Is it down?
- Yeah.

46
00:16:26,677 --> 00:16:28,431
I'm thinking about water.

47
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,535
I'm thinking about
water, let stick do the rest.

48
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,803
I find it every time.

49
00:16:44,591 --> 00:16:46,076
So it's

50
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:47,921
two fifty

51
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:50,667
for one good clean water well

52
00:16:50,691 --> 00:16:53,652
and three hundred for two.

53
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:59,180
Three hundred?

54
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,099
I tell you what then,

55
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:03,449
fella before you thought
he could save money too

56
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:05,869
you know what happened to him, huh?

57
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:11,416
No, we don't need.

58
00:17:11,632 --> 00:17:13,491
Let's go back.

59
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,588
David.

60
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:26,428
We use our minds.

61
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:37,969
Where will the water go?

62
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,181
High place or low place?

63
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:42,702
Low place.

64
00:17:46,898 --> 00:17:48,582
There.

65
00:17:51,108 --> 00:17:52,688
There?

66
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,802
OK.

67
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:58,092
There.

68
00:17:58,126 --> 00:18:01,425
- Why?
- Cause trees like water.

69
00:18:37,528 --> 00:18:39,056
David.

70
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:50,859
For the house, we have
to pay for water... huh.

71
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,946
David.

72
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,245
Now, you're a common sense man Mr Yi.

73
00:20:04,373 --> 00:20:07,195
Taking lands folks
too scared to buy.

74
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,243
- I admire a thinking man.
- Thank you.

75
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,474
Now, Iâ€™m-ma tell you,
farmer these days, you

76
00:20:12,498 --> 00:20:15,075
gotta go big or go home,
that's just outta here.

77
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:16,803
It's good time for it.

78
00:20:16,827 --> 00:20:19,849
Reagan's out to make sure
that the farmers are happy.

79
00:20:19,959 --> 00:20:22,434
And I'll be right here to help you.

80
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,911
Thank you very much.

81
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,592
You brought your helper.

82
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,919
Would you like a sucker?

83
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:29,968
They are not bad.

84
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,188
You would like a blue one.

85
00:20:33,957 --> 00:20:35,790
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

86
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:37,482
You're welcome.

87
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:55,214
If there's is some wrong, you can call
the owner, I'm just the one hauling it.

88
00:20:56,549 --> 00:20:59,049
Hey there. My name's Paul.

89
00:21:01,497 --> 00:21:03,051
Say hello.

90
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,374
OK.

91
00:21:09,797 --> 00:21:12,167
- Two thousand.
- Thank you.

92
00:21:12,983 --> 00:21:14,945
You know Mr Yi,

93
00:21:15,222 --> 00:21:17,202
if you want,

94
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:21,256
I drive these things all
day, I'm driving in my sleep.

95
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,423
I'm a good worker.

96
00:21:24,481 --> 00:21:25,940
Thank you, but...

97
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:27,952
these are Korean vegetables,

98
00:21:27,976 --> 00:21:29,132
Korean fruits.

99
00:21:29,156 --> 00:21:31,015
Korean?

100
00:21:32,724 --> 00:21:35,069
I wanna show you something.

101
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:37,158
Ah,

102
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,494
you better take a look at this.

103
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:41,703
Look at this.

104
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,129
This is old money,

105
00:21:49,153 --> 00:21:51,223
This is Korean war money.
- Yes sir.

106
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:54,207
I was there, it was a hard time.

107
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:56,777
I'm sure you know.

108
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,681
You wanna take it?

109
00:21:59,705 --> 00:22:02,623
David, what do you say?

110
00:22:02,787 --> 00:22:05,774
You know, it's funny,
the minute I saw you...

111
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,560
I knew we're gonna be friends.

112
00:22:09,886 --> 00:22:11,944
Can I pray?

113
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:13,723
Sorry?

114
00:22:15,831 --> 00:22:17,584
Thank you.

115
00:22:18,166 --> 00:22:19,998
Thank you God.

116
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,737
Thank you for the Yi Family.

117
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,977
Thank you for this divine appointment.

118
00:22:26,808 --> 00:22:29,864
Hallelujah.

119
00:22:30,027 --> 00:22:32,119
Hallelujah.

120
00:22:35,554 --> 00:22:37,950
Yes.

121
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,797
Big things.

122
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:46,736
You got big things
for this family.

123
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,307
OK.

124
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,484
Yeah.

125
00:23:57,508 --> 00:23:58,854
Of course.

126
00:24:05,047 --> 00:24:06,931
Why?

127
00:29:47,933 --> 00:29:49,133
David?

128
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:55,104
David, come.

129
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,902
Thank you grand ma.

130
00:31:54,396 --> 00:31:55,733
You...

131
00:31:57,568 --> 00:32:00,096
You might wanna check by
doing something out here.

132
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:01,374
You...

133
00:32:01,398 --> 00:32:02,655
What?

134
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:05,066
You know what exorcism is?

135
00:32:06,933 --> 00:32:08,418
Yeah.

136
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,965
You know,

137
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:16,723
what happened out here

138
00:32:17,713 --> 00:32:19,736
that's no good.

139
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:22,626
Something like that

140
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:26,793
not good.

141
00:32:29,248 --> 00:32:30,802
Out!

142
00:32:31,697 --> 00:32:33,479
Out in the name of Jesus!

143
00:32:33,503 --> 00:32:34,814
Out!

144
00:32:35,198 --> 00:32:39,070
Out in the name of Jesus!

145
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:40,755
Out!

146
00:32:42,235 --> 00:32:44,016
OK.

147
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,379
Now things,

148
00:32:45,403 --> 00:32:47,009
things will grow.

149
00:32:49,507 --> 00:32:51,256
How come you put
them so close to the other,

150
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,404
you don't want to put them
so close to the other like that.

151
00:32:53,428 --> 00:32:57,131
You gotta put them like
further apart, like that.

152
00:32:57,155 --> 00:32:58,979
No.

153
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:01,818
- Is that right?
- Yeah this is right.

154
00:33:01,842 --> 00:33:04,257
Otherwise, these are not gonna grow...
tinier than lettuces

155
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:06,519
They won't grow like, grow up.

156
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:08,932
No, it's here to here.

157
00:33:08,967 --> 00:33:10,547
Shoot man...

158
00:33:10,666 --> 00:33:12,969
We're growing in the Arkansas way.

159
00:33:12,993 --> 00:33:14,557
You know?

160
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,813
You'll be happy.

161
00:33:17,124 --> 00:33:18,756
I'm telling you.

162
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:22,714
You'll be happy.

163
00:33:31,878 --> 00:33:33,181
I don't want...

164
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:36,226
No, no, no. Get that away from
me in the name of Jesus.

165
00:33:36,302 --> 00:33:38,881
In the name of Jesus, get
that away, choo, choo, choo.

166
00:33:39,297 --> 00:33:42,518
You're crazy man, you... crazy.

167
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:45,624
- Just don't pass those cigarettes to me...
- OK, let's do it, OK.

168
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:48,183
Come on. Let's get this soil wet.

169
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:52,013
You ready? Yeah.

170
00:33:52,037 --> 00:33:54,147
Wow. OK.

171
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,424
That's free water.

172
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:05,038
Stop David.

173
00:35:10,057 --> 00:35:11,441
Go back.

174
00:35:11,465 --> 00:35:12,878
David...

175
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:16,707
Go back to your room, stop!
- David. David.

176
00:35:16,731 --> 00:35:19,500
Go to your room, David. Come.

177
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:24,082
There is a Korea smell.
- You've never even been to Korea.

178
00:35:24,106 --> 00:35:27,860
- Grandma smells like Korea.
- David...

179
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,617
I want some.

180
00:36:52,641 --> 00:36:54,641
No, this is mine.

181
00:36:54,665 --> 00:36:56,684
Yours is right there.

182
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,983
You know, she can't even read.

183
00:38:37,007 --> 00:38:39,768
She isn't like a real grandma.

184
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,856
You like grandma?

185
00:38:44,804 --> 00:38:46,348
Thank you.

186
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:09,332
David.

187
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:44,008
I'm going down.

188
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,606
David!

189
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:56,602
David. Come up here now.

190
00:39:57,339 --> 00:39:58,961
I'm telling mom.

191
00:40:39,758 --> 00:40:41,083
Good boy.

192
00:40:41,461 --> 00:40:42,919
Good boy.

193
00:42:22,234 --> 00:42:24,645
Only for kids.

194
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:27,442
Do you want to try?

195
00:44:14,957 --> 00:44:16,415
David.

196
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:31,184
Penis.

197
00:44:47,405 --> 00:44:50,628
Is this a dream?
Is this a dream?

198
00:44:53,405 --> 00:44:54,691
OK?

199
00:44:57,413 --> 00:44:58,899
Penis broken.

200
00:44:58,923 --> 00:45:00,738
Penis broken.

201
00:45:01,014 --> 00:45:04,473
It's not called the penis,
it's called the ding-dong.

202
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,050
Huh?

203
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,144
Ding-dong.

204
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:55,656
What a wonderful day to
be in the house of the Lord.

205
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,140
If you're here with
us for the first time,

206
00:45:58,164 --> 00:46:00,044
please stand.

207
00:46:01,766 --> 00:46:04,599
Now, don't be
ashamed, y'all stand up.

208
00:46:10,321 --> 00:46:12,286
What a beautiful family.

209
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,480
Glad you're are here.

210
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:16,507
Yeah, you be...

211
00:46:16,531 --> 00:46:18,581
be seated, thank you.

212
00:46:23,241 --> 00:46:25,234
- Oh, hi.
- Hi, I'm Monica.

213
00:46:25,258 --> 00:46:26,781
How long you've been in town?

214
00:46:26,805 --> 00:46:28,345
- Uh, I'm..
- Where you've been hiding?

215
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:30,657
I'm sorry. My English
is not so good.

216
00:46:30,681 --> 00:46:32,143
No, it's OK. We'll
teach you English.

217
00:46:32,167 --> 00:46:34,010
You're just too cute.

218
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:35,444
Thank you!

219
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:38,635
- OK, thank you.
- Okay.

220
00:46:38,659 --> 00:46:40,389
So cute!

221
00:46:51,313 --> 00:46:52,546
Hey.

222
00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,942
Can you stop me if I say
something in you language?

223
00:46:56,867 --> 00:46:58,161
Sure.

224
00:46:58,281 --> 00:47:01,747
Chinga Chinga Chong,
chuma, chuma choo.

225
00:47:09,182 --> 00:47:11,580
Why is your face so flat?

226
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:13,663
It isn't.

227
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:17,355
My name is John.

228
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,202
What's yours?

229
00:47:19,857 --> 00:47:21,413
David.

230
00:47:21,437 --> 00:47:23,216
Nice to meet your David.

231
00:47:26,212 --> 00:47:27,471
Hey, David!

232
00:47:27,495 --> 00:47:30,916
Lobomo, komo, romo?

233
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,433
Oh...

234
00:47:32,457 --> 00:47:33,636
Komo.

235
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,359
That means "Aunt" in Korea.

236
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:39,345
That is so neat.

237
00:47:52,272 --> 00:47:54,394
But I don't like Grandma.

238
00:47:57,382 --> 00:47:58,914
No?

239
00:47:58,938 --> 00:48:00,914
Why can't you?

240
00:48:00,938 --> 00:48:02,269
Why?

241
00:48:03,663 --> 00:48:07,019
Broken ding-dong.
Ding-dong broken.

242
00:48:51,272 --> 00:48:52,438
Paul?

243
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,286
What are you doing?

244
00:48:55,422 --> 00:48:56,679
It's uh...

245
00:48:56,703 --> 00:48:58,235
It's Sunday.

246
00:48:58,259 --> 00:49:00,106
It's my church.

247
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:04,286
OK, do you need a ride?

248
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,841
No I gotta finish this.

249
00:49:07,351 --> 00:49:09,387
I'll see you in Monday.

250
00:49:23,278 --> 00:49:24,986
See you Paul.

251
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:16,856
Pretty boy, pretty boy.

252
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,039
- Pretty...
- I'm not pretty, I'm good looking.

253
00:50:52,026 --> 00:50:55,242
Is this a dream?
Is this a dream?

254
00:51:07,388 --> 00:51:10,642
Ah! Good boy, good boy, good boy.

255
00:51:10,669 --> 00:51:13,299
Good boy, good boy.

256
00:51:13,724 --> 00:51:15,432
Good boy.

257
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:05,455
OKAY?

258
00:56:41,579 --> 00:56:43,521
- Paul.
- Yeah.

259
00:56:44,758 --> 00:56:46,609
Why is this so dry?

260
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:48,544
Yeah, it's dry.

261
00:56:48,633 --> 00:56:50,820
Is that dry over there?

262
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:53,318
Yeah, it's pretty much dry all.

263
00:57:01,157 --> 00:57:03,888
This one too, there is no water.

264
00:57:04,032 --> 00:57:05,482
Bone dry.

265
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,474
We better check that well.

266
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:18,568
If it's water to your well

267
00:57:19,563 --> 00:57:21,381
you won't get much further.

268
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:26,595
You know, if you want you can

269
00:57:26,619 --> 00:57:30,771
look at this, you can try with these
guys, you ever see one these guys?

270
00:57:33,535 --> 00:57:35,921
Right there, right there.

271
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,940
We need to find water somewhere.

272
00:57:44,708 --> 00:57:48,368
If that soil ain't wet, we're
gonna loose the crop.

273
01:01:13,034 --> 01:01:15,109
Mr Jacob Yi,

274
01:01:17,722 --> 01:01:20,656
there are some good
stuff out here Mr Jacob Yi.

275
01:01:21,292 --> 01:01:23,281
Oh, so beautiful.

276
01:01:23,925 --> 01:01:26,265
It's so beautiful Mr Jacob Yi.

277
01:01:26,526 --> 01:01:29,750
I think we better send it to Dallas.

278
01:01:30,175 --> 01:01:31,750
- Paul.
- Yeah?

279
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:34,085
Good job.

280
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:40,931
- Very good job.
- Oh yeah.

281
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:44,134
Good job.

282
01:01:45,544 --> 01:01:47,260
Good job.

283
01:01:48,433 --> 01:01:51,149
OK. That's... that's enough.

284
01:02:41,009 --> 01:02:42,670
Paul.

285
01:02:43,478 --> 01:02:45,034
- Come on.
- What?

286
01:02:45,058 --> 01:02:46,819
Take it back.

287
01:02:47,087 --> 01:02:49,303
- What for?
- Put it back.

288
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:53,043
What happened?

289
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:57,707
Take it back? Alright.

290
01:03:04,734 --> 01:03:07,012
Where are they
getting their produce at?

291
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:09,832
California.

292
01:03:11,562 --> 01:03:14,192
They just changed it
like that, aren't they?

293
01:03:14,507 --> 01:03:15,957
You know,

294
01:03:16,593 --> 01:03:18,949
we still got some time Jacob with

295
01:03:19,078 --> 01:03:21,219
you know, we find some place else.

296
01:03:21,243 --> 01:03:24,163
Just, it ain't rotting on the van.

297
01:03:24,187 --> 01:03:27,985
Korean people, big
city, you never trust them.

298
01:03:28,009 --> 01:03:30,487
We'll forget... just forget about Dallas,

299
01:03:30,511 --> 01:03:34,568
we'll forget about Dallas, we
just go Oklahoma City, Memphis.

300
01:03:34,649 --> 01:03:36,482
We've got...

301
01:03:38,525 --> 01:03:40,647
I'm still paying for water.

302
01:03:41,142 --> 01:03:42,702
Well, take it there.

303
01:03:44,087 --> 01:03:46,057
It's OK. It's gonna be alright.

304
01:03:46,081 --> 01:03:48,217
I've to go to work, OK?

305
01:03:48,501 --> 01:03:49,517
I've to go to work.

306
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:51,428
It's gonna be alright.

307
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:29,393
David,

308
01:04:29,623 --> 01:04:31,260
David,

309
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:34,421
David, go change, it's time to go.

310
01:04:34,445 --> 01:04:36,838
- Where?
- Church picnic.

311
01:06:09,521 --> 01:06:12,151
This just gets better and better.

312
01:06:42,756 --> 01:06:45,590
Strong, strong boy.

313
01:06:45,984 --> 01:06:48,574
Strong boy.

314
01:09:01,574 --> 01:09:06,289
â™ª Wonderful, wonderful, Minari. â™ª

315
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:09,749
â™ª Wonderful, wonderful, Minari. â™ª

316
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:48,818
I wanna come too.

317
01:13:33,109 --> 01:13:36,425
Oh my God, oh my God.

318
01:14:31,314 --> 01:14:33,276
â™ª Wonderful, â™ª

319
01:14:33,545 --> 01:14:35,169

01:14:35,941 --> 01:14:38,328
â™ª Minari. â™ª

01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:40,907
â™ª Wonderful, â™ª

322
01:14:41,323 --> 01:14:43,754
â™ª wonderful â™ª

323
01:14:44,257 --> 01:14:46,610
â™ª Minari. â™ª

324
01:14:46,703 --> 01:14:49,082
â™ª Minari. â™ª

325
01:15:57,744 --> 01:15:59,341
What?

326
01:17:00,008 --> 01:17:01,953
Why is she like that?

327
01:17:01,977 --> 01:17:05,604
We'll call mom from
church, get dressed.

328
01:17:16,001 --> 01:17:18,570
When Jesus comes again,

329
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:21,980
what a glorious day that's gonna be.

330
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:26,755
But what are you
gonna say, when he asks

331
01:17:26,779 --> 01:17:28,528
I'm going to go call mom, OK?
- OK.

332
01:17:28,552 --> 01:17:30,451
Why is Rick from work,

333
01:17:30,475 --> 01:17:32,724
Su from the bank?

334
01:17:33,460 --> 01:17:36,307
Why is Earl from the
grocery store, not with us?

335
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:42,223
Why didn't you preach the good news
of the salvation to those precious people?

336
01:17:51,311 --> 01:17:52,840
David,

337
01:17:56,726 --> 01:17:59,827
When will they come home?

338
01:18:00,249 --> 01:18:02,133
I don't know.

339
01:18:10,685 --> 01:18:12,535
There is that cross guy.

340
01:18:23,907 --> 01:18:25,609
You think he saw?

341
01:18:25,633 --> 01:18:28,218
I heard he got dirt pores
and he shits in a bucket.

342
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:30,901
He got no water where he leaves.

343
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,644
How's grandma?

344
01:18:55,668 --> 01:18:57,546
Mom said we can stay with friends.

345
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,091
Really?

346
01:19:00,842 --> 01:19:03,120
Mom's friend keeps this here.

347
01:19:03,144 --> 01:19:05,367
They don't mind.

348
01:19:16,078 --> 01:19:18,057
Wanna try some?

349
01:19:19,739 --> 01:19:21,608
Does it hurt?

350
01:19:21,944 --> 01:19:24,201
Put it like this.

351
01:19:32,668 --> 01:19:34,471
Only hurts if you eat it.

352
01:19:34,495 --> 01:19:36,746
Don't eat it, stupid.

353
01:19:40,032 --> 01:19:41,805
I'm a cow boy!

354
01:19:50,032 --> 01:19:52,237
You won't get points that way.

355
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:53,538
Junk card

356
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,580
You'll get more money.

357
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,538
- This one?
- Yeah.

358
01:20:02,807 --> 01:20:04,679
This is a great game.

359
01:20:04,703 --> 01:20:06,465
Yeah.

360
01:20:52,289 --> 01:20:54,650
Alright boys, breakfast.

361
01:20:59,048 --> 01:21:01,706
There you go, come
here Brook, give me a hug.

362
01:21:01,730 --> 01:21:04,463
Come on over here, come here.

363
01:21:05,658 --> 01:21:07,026
Get over here.

364
01:21:07,050 --> 01:21:08,491
You sleep good?

365
01:21:09,159 --> 01:21:10,540
That's your buddy huh?

366
01:21:10,565 --> 01:21:12,276
Hey, it's good to meet you.

367
01:21:12,605 --> 01:21:14,437
Go on, eat your breakfast.

368
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,146
How's your daddy like that new farm?

369
01:21:25,182 --> 01:21:26,702
Good.

370
01:21:27,734 --> 01:21:29,923
He growing things
good, doing things right?

371
01:21:29,947 --> 01:21:31,676
Yes.

372
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:33,593
That's good.

373
01:21:36,664 --> 01:21:39,442
I know the fella who was there before.

374
01:21:39,624 --> 01:21:42,454
- Who?
- Bucky Reed.

375
01:21:42,662 --> 01:21:44,833
Went flat broke.

376
01:21:45,049 --> 01:21:46,681
Boom.

377
01:21:48,148 --> 01:21:51,065
I guess it's what a man does.

378
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:58,165
You tell you momma,
I was here all night.- OK.

379
01:21:59,943 --> 01:22:03,789
And you help your dad
on that farm, alright?

380
01:22:04,708 --> 01:22:06,358
You hear me?

381
01:22:08,933 --> 01:22:11,815
Alright, Johnnie, I'll see
you in a while, alright?

382
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:14,148
I'm going to work.

383
01:24:32,762 --> 01:24:36,557
Mom wants to go back to
California because of Grandma.

384
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:38,798
When?

385
01:24:40,392 --> 01:24:44,548
First they are going to check
your heart, and then decide.

386
01:24:46,416 --> 01:24:49,620
Would you rather
leave with mom or dad?

387
01:24:50,465 --> 01:24:51,998
I don't know.

388
01:24:52,223 --> 01:24:53,925
Me neither.

389
01:25:03,152 --> 01:25:05,218
David, David.

390
01:25:06,459 --> 01:25:10,149
- Paul.
- Thank you, so much.

391
01:25:39,747 --> 01:25:41,179
Sorry.

392
01:25:41,873 --> 01:25:44,088
Don't put that kimchi too far away.

393
01:25:44,268 --> 01:25:46,196
I like it.

394
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:49,919
It made me, sweat on
my head, you know?

395
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:51,246
You're OK?

396
01:25:51,270 --> 01:25:52,833
I'm good.

397
01:25:59,543 --> 01:26:01,193
You're our first guest here.

398
01:26:01,217 --> 01:26:02,668
I'm honored.

399
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,838
Paul.

400
01:26:46,862 --> 01:26:49,224
She says something here.

401
01:26:49,248 --> 01:26:51,238
- Right here?
- Yeah, yeah.

402
01:26:53,165 --> 01:26:54,858
Look out.

403
01:26:55,222 --> 01:26:57,619
Look out, it's gonna

404
01:27:00,743 --> 01:27:03,304
cast you out.

405
01:27:03,582 --> 01:27:05,267
Cast you out.

406
01:27:05,291 --> 01:27:06,846
Cast you out.

407
01:27:07,547 --> 01:27:08,979
Hear our prayers,

408
01:27:09,003 --> 01:27:10,620
O heavenly father.

409
01:27:10,644 --> 01:27:12,337
Hear ours prayer

410
01:27:12,361 --> 01:27:13,717
come down.

411
01:27:13,741 --> 01:27:15,288
Jesus, mi amore.

412
01:27:15,312 --> 01:27:17,014
Only you can heal.

413
01:27:17,116 --> 01:27:19,201
Only you can heal.

414
01:27:19,225 --> 01:27:22,019
Hear the prayer that we...

415
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:24,894
It feels different, isn't it?

416
01:27:25,653 --> 01:27:27,790
It feels like lighter.

417
01:27:27,814 --> 01:27:30,046
- Yes, yes.
- Feel lighter.

418
01:27:30,729 --> 01:27:32,700
Thank you, thank you Paul.

419
01:27:32,724 --> 01:27:33,803
Thank you so much.

420
01:27:33,827 --> 01:27:35,154
Thank you.

421
01:27:35,178 --> 01:27:36,735
Wait here.

422
01:27:36,759 --> 01:27:39,198
I have something.
- OK.

423
01:27:47,128 --> 01:27:48,712
Hey.

424
01:27:52,401 --> 01:27:53,860
Do you,

425
01:27:53,911 --> 01:27:56,301
do you want me to

426
01:27:56,325 --> 01:27:57,610
pray for

427
01:27:57,634 --> 01:27:59,060
you and...

428
01:27:59,685 --> 01:28:01,560
If you want.

429
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:05,631
Why?

430
01:28:06,918 --> 01:28:08,472
No need.

431
01:28:09,130 --> 01:28:10,632
Why?

432
01:28:10,832 --> 01:28:13,019
- I meant...
- Come early tomorrow.

433
01:28:13,234 --> 01:28:15,101
OK? Lot of work.

434
01:29:58,054 --> 01:30:00,294
This looks good.

435
01:30:01,066 --> 01:30:04,330
- This looks good, you're all good.
- Okay.

436
01:30:05,648 --> 01:30:09,815
Wait, wait, OK, just one more thing.

437
01:30:12,689 --> 01:30:15,962
It's good, what do you think they
gonna say when they see that?

438
01:30:18,644 --> 01:30:19,858
Jacob.

439
01:30:20,205 --> 01:30:22,861
This is good, OK, this is good.

440
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:25,935
It's good.

441
01:30:25,959 --> 01:30:26,990
Yes.

442
01:30:27,014 --> 01:30:28,647
Hey.

443
01:30:29,619 --> 01:30:31,450
They won't say no.

444
01:30:31,474 --> 01:30:34,497
They won't say no!
- OK.

445
01:30:34,521 --> 01:30:37,073
- OK.
- I love these.

446
01:30:38,861 --> 01:30:43,139
This is a very exciting moment, this is
a very important moment, Jacob just...

447
01:30:43,934 --> 01:30:46,556
OK, OK.
- Yes!

448
01:32:22,564 --> 01:32:24,126
Thank you.

449
01:32:38,906 --> 01:32:40,425
Alright.

450
01:32:41,234 --> 01:32:42,953
Alright, buddy.

451
01:32:44,087 --> 01:32:46,585
You can sit up, get dressed,
and go wait in the waiting room,

452
01:32:46,609 --> 01:32:49,486
- how does that sound?
- Good, thank you.

453
01:32:49,510 --> 01:32:51,002
Thank you.

454
01:35:40,683 --> 01:35:44,042
Mr and Mrs Yi,
we're ready to see you now.

455
01:35:52,364 --> 01:35:55,492
OK, see, this is where
blood flows out, like a door.

456
01:35:55,516 --> 01:35:58,101
Open, close, open, close.

457
01:35:58,125 --> 01:36:00,271
You see how close the hole is here,

458
01:36:00,295 --> 01:36:02,089
now, this is why the
California doctor wanted

459
01:36:02,113 --> 01:36:04,107
to wait till he's bit
older before surgery.

460
01:36:04,525 --> 01:36:05,794
But,

461
01:36:05,818 --> 01:36:07,382
and are you ready?

462
01:36:07,406 --> 01:36:09,897
It looks like the hole is getting smaller.

463
01:36:11,051 --> 01:36:12,485
What?

464
01:36:12,509 --> 01:36:13,796
It's still there.

465
01:36:13,820 --> 01:36:18,117
But in comparing measurements,
it's a significant improvement.

466
01:36:18,471 --> 01:36:20,703
Right? This means,
we can rule out surgery.

467
01:36:20,727 --> 01:36:24,496
And we can see, if the
hole close up on its own.

468
01:36:25,945 --> 01:36:28,341
This is a very good news.

469
01:36:29,027 --> 01:36:31,457
Sounds, they... got louder.

470
01:36:31,481 --> 01:36:35,492
Yes, sometimes as the hole
gets smaller, the sound gets louder.

471
01:36:35,629 --> 01:36:37,287
Loud is good.

472
01:36:38,832 --> 01:36:40,482
Are we happy?

473
01:36:40,819 --> 01:36:43,329
Yes. I'm happy.

474
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:45,247
Thank you.

475
01:36:47,025 --> 01:36:48,831
Must be those Arc water.

476
01:36:48,855 --> 01:36:52,414
Whatever it is you're
doing, don't change a thing.

477
01:37:29,992 --> 01:37:31,633
Hey, what are these?

478
01:37:31,657 --> 01:37:33,890
I'm guessing some kind of

479
01:37:36,571 --> 01:37:38,386
Or maybe it's seeds.

480
01:37:38,490 --> 01:37:40,877
It kind of looks like peanuts.

481
01:37:42,539 --> 01:37:44,767
Kind of looks like
peanuts chopped in half.

482
01:37:44,791 --> 01:37:46,092
Yeah.

483
01:49:39,032 --> 01:49:41,402
Yeah, mark it.

484
01:49:41,426 --> 01:49:44,058
Might be where it is.

485
01:50:46,394 --> 01:50:48,087
David.
