00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:03,420
Romio

2
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:17,652
<i>The latest ceasefire came too late
to save these villages...</i>

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,755
Today President clinton voiced concerns
at the deteriorating situation in Sarajevo...

4
00:00:32,469 --> 00:00:36,765
When people ask me, good listeners,
why do I hate all the Tutsi,

5
00:00:36,848 --> 00:00:39,684
I say, "Read our history. "

6
00:00:39,768 --> 00:00:42,687
The Tutsi were collaborators
for the Belgian colonists.

7
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:45,774
They stole our Hutu land,
they whipped us.

8
00:00:45,857 --> 00:00:48,860
Now they have come back,
these Tutsi rebels.

9
00:00:48,944 --> 00:00:52,239
They are cockroaches.
They are murderers.

10
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:56,910
Rwanda is our Hutu land.
We are the majority.

11
00:00:56,911 --> 00:01:00,498
They are a minority of traitors
and invaders.

12
00:01:00,581 --> 00:01:06,420
We will squash the infestation.
We will wipe out the RPF rebels.

13
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:09,924
This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.

14
00:01:10,007 --> 00:01:13,176
Stay alert.
Watch your neighbors.

15
00:01:32,572 --> 00:01:36,117
- Mr, Rusesabagina, thank you,
- Good to see you, sir,

16
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:49,340
Thank you,

17
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,842
These are for you, sir,
They're fresh from Havana,

18
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:54,845
Wonderful, Next time you are there,
tell Fidel that I said hello,

19
00:01:55,763 --> 00:01:57,139
Good to see you gentlemen,

20
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:24,250
That is a fine cigar, sir,

21
00:02:24,835 --> 00:02:26,670
This is a Cohiba cigar,

22
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,674
- Each one is worth 10,000 francs,

23
00:02:30,757 --> 00:02:34,010
Yes, yes, But it is worth
more to me than 10,000 francs,

24
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:35,762
What do you mean, sir?

25
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:42,477
If I give a businessman 10,000 francs,
what does that matter to him?

26
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:46,481
He is rich,
But if I give him a Cohiba cigar

27
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:51,319
straight from Havana, Cuba,,,
Hey, that is style, Dube,

28
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:53,155
Style,

29
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:06,127
Cohiba--a fantastic cigar,

30
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,337
The best, eh?

31
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:11,007
So, you're going to koin us
at the rally today?

32
00:03:13,552 --> 00:03:14,928
I will try my best, George,

33
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,598
but these days I have no time
for rallies and politics,

34
00:03:18,682 --> 00:03:22,185
Politics is power, Paul,
Hutu power,

35
00:03:22,227 --> 00:03:23,520
And money,

36
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,068
It's time for you
to koin your people,

37
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:32,905
Thank you, George,

38
00:03:33,823 --> 00:03:35,825
But time is also money,

39
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,953
I need six extra cases
of beer today,

40
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:41,914
along with the regular order,

41
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,628
- Business is good at the hotel,
- It is very good,

42
00:03:48,629 --> 00:03:50,881
I'm always glad
to see you, Paul,

43
00:03:57,597 --> 00:04:00,224
Put that back! Put that back!
That's not beer!

44
00:04:05,522 --> 00:04:08,066
- You, clean this up,
- Yes, sir, Come on,

45
00:04:08,191 --> 00:04:10,818
Paul, don't worry
about the Carlsberg,

46
00:04:10,902 --> 00:04:13,613
I'll give you Heineken,
and I won't charge you extra,

47
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:14,740
Thank you,

48
00:04:19,203 --> 00:04:22,831
A bargain buy from China--
ten cents each,

49
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,293
You know, I'll get at least fifty,

50
00:04:26,877 --> 00:04:28,211
At least,

51
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:38,180
George Rutaganda is a bad man,

52
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:41,058
I've heard him on the radio
telling the Hutus to kill all the Tutsis,

53
00:04:42,518 --> 00:04:45,521
Rutaganda and his people,
they are fools, Dube,

54
00:04:45,605 --> 00:04:47,899
Their time is soon over,

55
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:49,984
Anyway, this is business,

56
00:04:55,907 --> 00:04:59,535
- Oh, no, It's the lnterhamwe,

57
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:21,809
No, no, sit up, Dube, Sit up,

58
00:05:21,892 --> 00:05:23,894
Smile, Dube, Don't attract

59
00:05:23,978 --> 00:05:27,898
Some of these men are my neighbors,
They know that I'm Tutsi,

60
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,443
Just smile as if
they are friends, Dube,

61
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:37,825
- I know this man!
- Are you a Tutsi?

62
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,202
What are you doing here?

63
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:42,913
No, no, Hutu power,
Hutu power, Hutu power!

64
00:05:44,374 --> 00:05:46,042
Okay, Yes!

65
00:05:50,464 --> 00:05:51,798
Get out of here,

66
00:06:00,057 --> 00:06:02,059
There's water coming from the box,

67
00:06:02,184 --> 00:06:04,311
Park here,
We'll go in the front,

68
00:06:07,731 --> 00:06:09,983
Gregoire, please help with this water,

69
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:12,444
Gregoire!

70
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,196
Deal with this right away,

71
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,366
- We were hoping to go see the gorilla,
- You must contact our safari desk,

72
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:21,370
Dube, this is the lobby,

73
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:23,997
- What's going on?
- I am sorry, sir, It is an emergency,

74
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,045
Oh, shit! Oh, sorry, sir,

75
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,635
Ten alive, twelve are dead,

76
00:06:38,221 --> 00:06:39,388
All right,

77
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,183
But save the shells,

78
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:43,727
Fill them with,,,

79
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:47,897
,,,a stuffing,
The good meat and something local,

80
00:06:47,898 --> 00:06:51,735
- Cassava?
- And,,,the fish,

81
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:53,903
- And tipali,
- Yes,

82
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:57,824
We'll call it "fresh lobster
in a cassava and tipali crust,"

83
00:06:57,908 --> 00:06:58,909
Dube,

84
00:06:58,909 --> 00:07:00,368
Style, sir,

85
00:07:00,369 --> 00:07:01,912
Yes, sir,

86
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:08,836
The problem is, General Bizimungu,
I have information

87
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,050
that the lnterhamwe militia
will not heed the peace agreement,

88
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,762
Colonel, the U,N, need not worry
about the lnterhamwe,

89
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:18,971
We will control them,

90
00:07:19,055 --> 00:07:21,307
- General,
- Paul,

91
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:23,476
This scotch is exceptional,

92
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:27,313
It is our most popular single malt,
I knew you'd like it,

93
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:29,232
Colonel Oliver,

94
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,318
Good to see you, Paul,

95
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,905
General, let me recommend

96
00:07:34,905 --> 00:07:36,907
It is spectacular--
straight off the plane,

97
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,909
Fresh lobster in Kigali,
You do us proud, Paul,

98
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,911
Thank you,

99
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:43,913
I left a little something for you
at the coat check,

100
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,457
Excuse me, gentlemen,

101
00:07:48,544 --> 00:07:50,879
I need flour,
Give me two bags of flour,

102
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:54,508
Okay, the plates are ready,
Here they come,

103
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,595
Good afternoon, ladies,

104
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:01,265
Elizabeth, please put these
in the general's briefcase,

105
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,600
Yes, sir,

106
00:08:04,435 --> 00:08:05,936
This is RTLM, Hutu Power Radio.

107
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,440
I have a message for our president.

108
00:08:09,524 --> 00:08:13,361
Beware. Do not trust
the Tutsi rebels.

109
00:08:13,445 --> 00:08:15,947
Do not shake the hand
that will stab you.

110
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:17,282
They will treat you...

111
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:21,118
... reporting from Kigali, Rwanda,
where tensions are high

112
00:08:21,244 --> 00:08:24,330
as the deadline for the U. N.-brokered
peace agreement approaches.

113
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:30,086
Hello, Mr, Paul,

114
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,435
Hello, Jeremiah,

115
00:08:45,853 --> 00:08:47,020
Hello, sir,

116
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:54,487
- Good to see you, Paul,
- Odette,

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,781
See you soon,

118
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:01,786
So your brother
and the girls are here,

119
00:09:01,869 --> 00:09:03,036
Yes,

120
00:09:04,247 --> 00:09:05,331
One, two, three,,,

121
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:07,250
Oh, Carine!

122
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:09,877
Okay, Anais, let me see,
Your turn,

123
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:11,420
One, two, three,,,

124
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,342
Who is the winner?
Oh, it doesn't matter,

125
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:18,219
I have chocolates,
Who wants chocolates?

126
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,428
Hey, Papa, watch this,

127
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:25,852
Oh, my goodness, Well, here,
chocolates, chocolates, Who wants?

128
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,605
Say thank you to your Uncle Paul,

129
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:31,775
- Please, not before dinner,

130
00:09:31,859 --> 00:09:33,944
- Thank you,
- Okay, okay,

131
00:09:34,028 --> 00:09:35,362
Let's go in,

132
00:09:41,577 --> 00:09:44,788
Things are very slow at the shop,
How are things at the hotel?

133
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:47,958
Very busy,
Many people visiting the gorillas,

134
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,878
A lot of foreign press arriving
for the peace acc--

135
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:53,422
- What?
- There are soldiers,

136
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:56,008
- Where?
- On the street,

137
00:10:00,096 --> 00:10:02,932
I'll go see what's happening,
It's all right,

138
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:09,940
- We know you are Tutsi,
- Please, sir, this is my husband,

139
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:12,442
- He's kust a gardener,
- He's been spying for the rebels,

140
00:10:12,442 --> 00:10:15,236
- No, we do not know any rebels,
- You will come with us!

141
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,365
No, we are telling the truth,
We do not know any,,,

142
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:20,575
- What is it?
- Shut up!

143
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:23,328
Tatiana, go back in the house,
You must go back,

144
00:10:23,412 --> 00:10:25,414
- You mustn't be out here,
- It's Victor,

145
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,335
No, Captain, you see--

146
00:10:30,419 --> 00:10:33,505
It's not me, It's not me,
Captain, Captain,

147
00:10:33,589 --> 00:10:36,091
Why are you taking him away?
Please, please,

148
00:10:36,217 --> 00:10:38,677
- I know, I know, but it's not me,

149
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:41,346
No! No!

150
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:42,682
We must do something,

151
00:10:42,807 --> 00:10:44,517
- Do what?
- Call someone,

152
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:47,436
I'm not going, I'm not going,

153
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,521
No!

154
00:10:54,527 --> 00:10:56,779
Get him in the truck, Now!

155
00:10:57,864 --> 00:10:59,490
We must do something,

156
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,659
Please help him!

157
00:11:01,785 --> 00:11:04,245
Oh, Victor!

158
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:05,789
Victor!

159
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,666
There is nothing we can do,

160
00:11:08,792 --> 00:11:11,503
- You must stay the night, Thomas,
- Yes,

161
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:16,341
No!

162
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,262
Why would they arrest Victor?

163
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,433
He has no politics,

164
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,937
- He's a gardener,
- Who knows, Tatsi?

165
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,356
Who knows?

166
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:34,277
Someone who didn't like him
denounced him as a rebel spy,

167
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:37,363
Happens all the time now,

168
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:44,370
Maybe you could call
one of your contacts in the army,

169
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,581
It wouldn't help,

170
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,960
You could ask as a favor,

171
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,211
No, I could not,

172
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:58,426
Tatsi, all day long I work
to please this officer,

173
00:11:58,427 --> 00:12:02,347
that diplomat, some tourist,
to store up favors

174
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:05,017
so if there is a time
when we need help,

175
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:07,102
I have powerful people
I can call upon,

176
00:12:07,269 --> 00:12:09,521
But Victor was a good neighbor,

177
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:13,942
He is not family,
Family is all that matters,

178
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:19,823
Please, please,
leave these things to my good kudgment,

179
00:12:35,632 --> 00:12:38,009
This assignment is bullshit,

180
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:41,095
Come on, A few days in a nice hotel,
no one shooting at us?

181
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,726
Gentlemen, welcome

182
00:12:46,852 --> 00:12:49,062
I am Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager,

183
00:12:49,146 --> 00:12:50,981
- How you doing?
- Nice to meet you,

184
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:53,275
Anything that you need,
please find me,

185
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:54,651
- Thank you,
- Certainly,

186
00:13:02,284 --> 00:13:06,329
So, what is the actual difference

187
00:13:06,414 --> 00:13:10,835
According to the Belgian colonists,
the Tutsis are taller and more elegant,

188
00:13:10,918 --> 00:13:13,837
It was the Belgians
that created the division,

189
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:15,380
How?

190
00:13:15,465 --> 00:13:18,843
They picked people,
those with thinner noses, lighter skin,

191
00:13:18,927 --> 00:13:20,929
They used to measure
the width of people's noses,

192
00:13:21,012 --> 00:13:23,556
The Belgians used the Tutsis
to run the country,

193
00:13:23,556 --> 00:13:26,016
Then when they left,
they left the power to the Hutus,

194
00:13:26,017 --> 00:13:28,269
and of course the Hutus
took revenge

195
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:30,563
on the elite Tutsis
for years of repression,

196
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:32,482
Am I telling the truth, Paul?

197
00:13:32,566 --> 00:13:35,902
Yes, unfortunately,
Please take this to the general,

198
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:40,281
Benedict is our finest kournalist
in Kigali, an expert on the subkect,

199
00:13:41,992 --> 00:13:43,326
So what are you, Paul?

200
00:13:45,996 --> 00:13:47,289
I am Hutu,

201
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:49,332
Gentlemen,

202
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:53,920
- More champagne?
- More champagne would be nice,

203
00:13:54,004 --> 00:13:57,299
Excuse me, honey,
Can I ask you a personal question?

204
00:13:57,383 --> 00:14:01,845
- Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?
- I am Tutsi,

205
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,724
- And your friend? Tutsi?
- No, I am Hutu,

206
00:14:08,478 --> 00:14:09,854
They could be twins,

207
00:14:10,396 --> 00:14:13,565
Get the camera,
The general's going to give us an interview,

208
00:14:13,566 --> 00:14:14,567
Okay,

209
00:14:15,985 --> 00:14:19,905
I'm in room 22, I'd love
to finish up this conversation,

210
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:26,830
Senior U.N. officers claim that
the Rwandan army is secretly training

211
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:30,166
and arming the Hutu militia
called the Interhamwe.

212
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:34,629
I put this claim to the head
of the armed forces, General Bizimungu.

213
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:38,466
No. No, we have not been
training the militia.

214
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,552
The U. N. are mistaken
in this accusation.

215
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:43,179
Do you support your president's
agreement to make peace with the rebels?

216
00:14:43,305 --> 00:14:46,725
The president has
the full support of the army.

217
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:49,854
That peace agreement will
be signed today in Tanzania

218
00:14:49,937 --> 00:14:53,273
between Tutsi rebel forces
and President Habyarimana.

219
00:14:53,316 --> 00:14:56,068
This is a great day for Rwanda

220
00:14:56,152 --> 00:14:58,070
and for all of Africa,

221
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:00,823
Negotiation has replaced confrontation,,,

222
00:15:00,907 --> 00:15:03,409
Paul, have a drink,

223
00:15:03,493 --> 00:15:05,328
Friendship has replaced fear,

224
00:15:05,411 --> 00:15:07,579
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a live feed

225
00:15:07,622 --> 00:15:09,540
to the signing
of the peace agreement,

226
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:13,085
To our president,
May he find peace,

227
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,838
May we all find peace,

228
00:15:15,922 --> 00:15:21,552
Let us all dedicate ourselves
to nurturing this hard-earned accord,

229
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:22,930
To peace!

230
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,097
Peace!

231
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:29,728
- Look me up if you come over,
- Yes, it is a beautiful city,

232
00:15:29,853 --> 00:15:32,313
I am planning on returning there as--
Forgive me,

233
00:15:32,398 --> 00:15:34,566
- Thank you, Bye,
- Thomas,

234
00:15:36,735 --> 00:15:38,570
- Hello, Fedens,

235
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,906
Well, this is a surprise,

236
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:43,409
Forgive us, Paul,
We must talk,

237
00:15:44,285 --> 00:15:46,161
Yes, what's wrong?

238
00:15:46,287 --> 00:15:49,081
I have it from a very
reliable source, Paul,

239
00:15:49,165 --> 00:15:50,291
Who?

240
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:53,168
Thank you, Sullivan,

241
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:58,925
My assistant,
the Hutu Power man,

242
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:02,011
He says that we must get out now,
that soon it'll be very bad,

243
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,555
Give me this man's name,

244
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,267
Please, Paul, even though
he is lnterhamwe, he's a friend,

245
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:10,144
He wants your kob, Thomas,

246
00:16:14,149 --> 00:16:17,402
He said that
there is a signal,

247
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,072
It is "Cut the tall trees,"

248
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:24,993
And when they hear this signal,
the militia are to go to war,

249
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:28,998
Paul, please, let us
take Tatiana with us,

250
00:16:28,998 --> 00:16:31,000
You are Hutu,
You will be safe,

251
00:16:32,168 --> 00:16:36,088
Fedens, I know you
have heard many things,

252
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:39,091
And I know
what we have seen, Thomas,

253
00:16:39,175 --> 00:16:41,927
But please, the United Nations
are here now,

254
00:16:42,011 --> 00:16:44,555
The world press are watching,

255
00:16:44,555 --> 00:16:47,391
The peace has been signed,
Let this process work--

256
00:16:47,475 --> 00:16:49,018
What was that?

257
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:54,690
Power cuts,

258
00:16:55,984 --> 00:16:58,111
We are running on generators,

259
00:16:59,112 --> 00:17:01,114
Fedens,,,

260
00:17:01,114 --> 00:17:02,782
Please, don't worry,

261
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:08,705
Tomorrow you will come by the house
and we will discuss this with Tatiana,

262
00:17:08,747 --> 00:17:10,123
All right?

263
00:17:12,751 --> 00:17:15,754
- Good night, Paul,
- Yes, Kiss the girls for me,

264
00:17:44,325 --> 00:17:45,618
Shit!

265
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:02,677
Stay in your houses,
Stay in your house,

266
00:18:02,761 --> 00:18:04,971
Everybody stay in your house!

267
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:37,755
Tatiana?

268
00:19:07,703 --> 00:19:09,871
- Paul!
- Tatiana!

269
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:14,127
- What is going on here?
- Our house has been burned,

270
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,045
- Didn't you hear the news?
- What news?

271
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:20,466
They are saying President Habyarimana
has been murdered,

272
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,343
Tutsi rebels have killed him,

273
00:19:22,385 --> 00:19:25,763
Nonsense, Why would the rebels kill
the president when he agreed to peace?

274
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:31,770
Everyone, please,
out of this room, Please,

275
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:33,897
Jean Baptiste, find them seats
in the other room,

276
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,773
Odette, please,

277
00:19:39,111 --> 00:19:43,198
- Did you meet with Thomas and Fedens?
- Yes, I told them to go home,

278
00:19:44,324 --> 00:19:47,911
- Go and call them, Tatsi,

279
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:56,212
- Why do the neighbors run to us?
- You are the only Hutu they can trust,

280
00:19:56,337 --> 00:19:57,880
You are a Tutsi,

281
00:19:57,963 --> 00:20:01,216
They are scared, Paul,
I am scared,

282
00:20:07,598 --> 00:20:10,434
These are probably rumors
started by agitators,

283
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:13,312
We must remain calm
for the children, Tatsi, We must,

284
00:20:13,771 --> 00:20:17,358
Forgive me, Paul,
Elys says that Roger has gone,

285
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,694
Gone? Gone where?

286
00:20:19,694 --> 00:20:23,447
- He was afraid for his friend Simon, Mama,

287
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:24,616
He went next door,

288
00:20:25,617 --> 00:20:27,368
Wait, Paul!

289
00:20:27,452 --> 00:20:30,538
Tatiana, no, You have to

290
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:32,457
- Stay in the house, No!
- Please,

291
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:43,761
Paul, please, what is wrong?
Tell me, what is wrong?

292
00:20:43,886 --> 00:20:46,889
- Oh, my son! Where are you hurt?
- Is he okay? Oh, my baby!

293
00:20:46,972 --> 00:20:49,057
Talk to me,
Where are you hurt?

294
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:50,225
Paul?

295
00:20:52,895 --> 00:20:54,062
Oh, Tatsi,

296
00:20:56,357 --> 00:20:58,359
Odette, Odette!

297
00:20:58,443 --> 00:20:59,444
Oh, no,

298
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:00,986
I'm okay,

299
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,447
Get his clothes off,
Tatsi, please get some water,

300
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:05,699
- He's hurt,
- Please, let's get his clothes off,

301
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:08,202
- He's covered in blood,
- Lay back, son,

302
00:21:09,954 --> 00:21:11,956
He went next door
to the Chirangas,

303
00:21:12,874 --> 00:21:14,625
Where is he hurt?

304
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,212
Look here, Odette, look here,

305
00:21:17,379 --> 00:21:19,965
Stay still, Roger,
Keep him still, Paul,

306
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:23,385
- I can't find the wound,
- What happened to you?

307
00:21:23,468 --> 00:21:24,927
- Tell your mother,
- Talk to me,

308
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:27,097
Tell your mother
what happened, Roger,

309
00:21:27,181 --> 00:21:28,640
Roger, you're okay,

310
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,477
Do not worry, he is not cut,
He is not hurt,

311
00:21:32,561 --> 00:21:35,021
This is not his blood, Paul,

312
00:21:36,273 --> 00:21:37,649
You are not hurt,

313
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,195
My darling, it's okay,
It's okay,

314
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,113
You are safe,
Look at your mother,

315
00:21:43,197 --> 00:21:45,240
Come here, Elys,

316
00:21:45,241 --> 00:21:48,828
- Where did the blood come from?
- Please, please!

317
00:21:49,746 --> 00:21:51,664
- You are safe,
- You are out, Roger,

318
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:54,500
You are safe, you are safe, Roger,
You are safe, Roger,

319
00:21:54,584 --> 00:21:56,168
It's okay,

320
00:21:56,252 --> 00:21:58,504
I love you so much,
I love you,

321
00:22:18,358 --> 00:22:19,651
Oh, son,

322
00:22:24,114 --> 00:22:25,573
Paul,

323
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:31,079
Listen to me, good people of Rwanda.
Terrible news...

324
00:22:31,163 --> 00:22:34,166
- It is true,
- Horrible news...

325
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:39,004
Our great president
is murdered by the Tutsi cockroaches.

326
00:22:39,005 --> 00:22:40,006
Oh, my God!

327
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:43,926
They tricked him to sign
their phony peace agreement.

328
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,637
Then they shot his plane
from the sky.

329
00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:52,018
It is time to clear the brush,
good Hutus of Rwanda.

330
00:22:53,103 --> 00:22:55,939
We must cut the tall trees.

331
00:22:56,564 --> 00:22:59,400
cut the tall trees now!

332
00:22:59,484 --> 00:23:01,027
The soldiers are here!

333
00:23:01,111 --> 00:23:04,030
- Let us go to work, loyal Hutus.
- No, no,

334
00:23:04,114 --> 00:23:06,658
Everyone, stay calm,
Stay calm and be quiet,

335
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:11,163
Find these traitors.
Let none of them escape.

336
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,832
Split up,
Everybody out,

337
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:19,421
- You two, check the back,

338
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,509
- You, go and find him,
- Yes, sir,

339
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:31,726
I better go have a word with them,

340
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:35,813
Go around the back,
Make sure no one comes out,

341
00:23:35,938 --> 00:23:36,939
Yes, sir!

342
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:40,651
Who's in charge here?

343
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:41,944
You,

344
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,745
- Can I help you, sir?
- Everybody out! Out!

345
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:53,748
- Let me see your identity card,
- Grab your things, Go!

346
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:55,834
I am a good friend
of General Bizimungu,

347
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:57,001
Get out!

348
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,590
Get out of here!

349
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:05,009
Everybody, out!
Get out, get out!

350
00:24:05,094 --> 00:24:06,678
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?

351
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,931
No, I work at the Mille Collines,

352
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:13,518
I used to work at the Diplomat,

353
00:24:13,561 --> 00:24:16,272
We want to use that hotel,
All the room keys are in the safe,

354
00:24:16,397 --> 00:24:18,732
You must open it,
Let's go,

355
00:24:18,816 --> 00:24:22,361
- Paul!
- Sir, I cannot leave my family,

356
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:25,198
I must take them with me,
It is not safe here,

357
00:24:25,281 --> 00:24:27,408
There are Tutsi spies everywhere,

358
00:24:27,492 --> 00:24:29,118
I cannot take all these people,

359
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:31,162
No, no, sir,

360
00:24:31,246 --> 00:24:34,082
We have our car
and our van,

361
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:36,834
- captain Kaliso, come on.
- Roger,

362
00:24:37,377 --> 00:24:41,422
- Let's go!
- Come on, Hurry! Go around, go around,

363
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,758
We found him,
Let's go, Let's go!

364
00:24:45,177 --> 00:24:48,597
- Can I go with you?
- Yes, of course, Jeremiah, Hurry,

365
00:24:58,816 --> 00:25:00,400
Oh, Jesus, no!

366
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:03,821
Oh, it's Simon, Papa!

367
00:25:04,947 --> 00:25:08,116
Don't look, don't look, don't look,

368
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,477
- The safe is in the manager's office,
- You two, go with him,

369
00:26:23,778 --> 00:26:26,155
Look at this, Beer,

370
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:44,550
I've got them,

371
00:26:56,229 --> 00:26:57,688
Get down, all of you!

372
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:07,615
Sir, sir, Here, I have them,

373
00:27:12,329 --> 00:27:14,164
Traitor!

374
00:27:14,247 --> 00:27:16,165
These are Tutsi cockroaches!

375
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:19,294
Let me explain, sir,
Please wait,

376
00:27:22,631 --> 00:27:23,715
Shoot them,

377
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,300
Shoot them,

378
00:27:28,136 --> 00:27:31,806
Please, I don't use guns,
I don't,

379
00:27:31,849 --> 00:27:32,850
It's easy,

380
00:27:37,855 --> 00:27:41,150
Shoot them, or you die first,

381
00:27:42,068 --> 00:27:45,780
Sir, what could I pay you
not to do this?

382
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:47,698
You wanna pay me?

383
00:27:47,698 --> 00:27:50,158
Why not?
Look at them,

384
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:52,078
These are not rebels,

385
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:56,540
Soon they will be worthless to you,
Why not take some money for your work?

386
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,168
- How much?
- You name a price,

387
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,803
10,000 francs for each,

388
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,307
- Sir, I don't have that much,

389
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:14,434
Wait, wait! Here,

390
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:17,854
It's 1,000 U,S,

391
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:21,483
50,000 francs for my wife and children,

392
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,694
- Take them,
- Go, go, go,

393
00:28:23,777 --> 00:28:26,154
Go, go, go,

394
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,156
- Have you any money?
- Nothing,

395
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,451
- Paul, don't let them die,

396
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,417
Sir, I have more money actually,

397
00:28:41,295 --> 00:28:44,631
And let them give you something,
Some money, whatever they have,

398
00:28:44,716 --> 00:28:45,800
All right?

399
00:28:47,302 --> 00:28:49,554
Here you are,
Give me everything you have,

400
00:28:51,723 --> 00:28:53,558
Here, Paul, it's all I have,

401
00:28:56,561 --> 00:28:58,729
Here you are, See?

402
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:03,652
This is enough for one cockroach,
Pick one,

403
00:29:05,237 --> 00:29:06,446
Sir,,,

404
00:29:08,615 --> 00:29:11,993
I will give you 100,000 francs
for all of them,

405
00:29:13,996 --> 00:29:15,872
- Give me it,
- I don't have it here,

406
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:18,000
At the Mille Collines
I can get it for you,

407
00:29:18,083 --> 00:29:20,460
You'll run into the hotel
and hide behind the U,N,

408
00:29:20,544 --> 00:29:25,215
Sir, I swear,

409
00:29:25,299 --> 00:29:28,802
I will get you the money,
You keep them outside,

410
00:29:31,472 --> 00:29:33,640
Please, sir, Please,

411
00:29:34,976 --> 00:29:37,562
- Let's go,
- Okay, Everyone in the van,

412
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:39,313
Come on now, Hurry,

413
00:29:51,076 --> 00:29:54,871
Go with my soldiers, And hurry back
if you want to keep these cockroaches,

414
00:29:59,543 --> 00:30:02,295
The soldiers are here,
Where is the car?

415
00:30:02,296 --> 00:30:05,716
There is nothing I can do,
Excuse me, sir! Please, could you--

416
00:30:18,062 --> 00:30:19,480
Here's the money,

417
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,024
100,000 francs as promised,

418
00:30:22,108 --> 00:30:24,110
Now please, let them go, sir,

419
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:26,362
Take the money,
We will get them later,

420
00:30:29,198 --> 00:30:31,366
- You can go,
- Thank you,

421
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:34,578
Traitor,

422
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,460
Thank you, Paul,

423
00:30:45,924 --> 00:30:48,843
Do you understand, Dube?
Because I can't wait for Paul,

424
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:51,179
- You must tell him when he comes--
- Here he is, sir,

425
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:56,851
Paul, I have to go,
The staff of Kivu Lodge have fled,

426
00:30:56,935 --> 00:30:59,854
I have to close up there,
You are in charge now,

427
00:30:59,938 --> 00:31:01,105
It's okay, it's okay,

428
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:04,901
There were no survivors in last night's
plane crash in Kigali, Rwanda.

429
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:07,738
Everyone, please move to the side,
Clear the door,

430
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:09,198
Come, Tatsi,

431
00:31:11,617 --> 00:31:13,744
Andre, I need two suites,

432
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:16,205
- Paul, please, where is my passport?
- Yes, I understand,

433
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:20,375
- I need to get hold of my embassy,
- If you give me one moment, please,

434
00:31:21,753 --> 00:31:25,465
- Odette, Jean Baptiste, take this room,
- What about our neighbors?

435
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:28,217
What will they do?

436
00:31:30,762 --> 00:31:33,139
- Dube,
- Yes, sir?

437
00:31:34,766 --> 00:31:39,103
Please,,,put these "guests"
in two staff rooms,

438
00:31:39,187 --> 00:31:40,688
Right away, sir,

439
00:31:49,364 --> 00:31:52,533
No, no, no, Please, it's old,

440
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,124
It's all right, Roger,
It's all right, We're here,

441
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,044
- Ah, Joseph,
- Your suit, sir,

442
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,504
This mess is unacceptable,

443
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:06,590
Call housekeeping, get them
up here right away, Thank you,

444
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,928
- I'm trying Thomas and Fedens,
- All right,

445
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,100
Operator, I need a line,

446
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,020
I need a line now, Please, Hello?

447
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,026
You did not reach them?

448
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:28,279
No, No answer,

449
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:33,493
It is a very tense situation,
and I just want to assure the families

450
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:36,663
of those who are there that we are
doing everything we possibly can

451
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,291
to try to ensure
the safety of our citizens there.

452
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,584
Can you at least tell us,
is the airport actually open?

453
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,379
We are calling the airport,
We are calling the embassy,

454
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,049
We are trying to get as much
information for you as we can,

455
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:48,925
- And yes, your passport, yes,
- And my passport,

456
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:51,345
Antoinette will take care
of this for you,

457
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,682
Dube, where is Gregoire?

458
00:32:58,102 --> 00:33:01,522
Sir, he has moved

459
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,371
Mr, Manager,

460
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,293
What do you think
you are doing, Gregoire?

461
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:22,752
Who is it?

462
00:33:23,503 --> 00:33:25,046
It's okay, darling,

463
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,132
What do you want?

464
00:33:27,215 --> 00:33:30,760
You had better get out of this room
and back downstairs right away,

465
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:34,056
- I don't have to listen to you anymore,
- Yes, you do,

466
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:37,267
I am in charge, Now get out
of this room right now,

467
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:47,903
Mr, Manager, do you notice
the smell of cockroaches?

468
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,533
If I were to leave this room,

469
00:33:53,284 --> 00:33:55,744
And I know people
who can cleanse it,

470
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,750
But maybe it doesn't bother you,
Why is that?

471
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,045
Are you used to the smell?

472
00:34:05,588 --> 00:34:06,839
Well, not me,

473
00:34:07,841 --> 00:34:10,218
I need a clean room
to escape it,

474
00:34:16,475 --> 00:34:20,270
Please move into the hotel,
Everyone, keep moving,

475
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:22,689
My house has been burned,
I have nowhere to go,

476
00:34:22,773 --> 00:34:24,274
Yes, I understand this, Your Honor,

477
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:26,610
But we are operating
at capacity as it is,

478
00:34:26,694 --> 00:34:30,531
I can give you one room,
but you will have to share it, I'm sorry,

479
00:34:30,614 --> 00:34:33,200
- There's no way we can share,
- I am sorry, Forgive me,

480
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,785
There are eight of us,

481
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,369
- Yes?
- Paul, I need your help,

482
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:37,621
Yes, Madame Archer,

483
00:34:45,129 --> 00:34:47,923
They're Tutsi children
from the St, Francis orphanage,

484
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:50,217
Okay, come on, let's go,

485
00:34:50,843 --> 00:34:53,804
- I have only one room,
- That'll do,

486
00:34:56,057 --> 00:34:57,558
Come,

487
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,977
- Otto, please,
- Excuse me,

488
00:35:01,104 --> 00:35:04,107
Corporal, take that lady's bag, please,
and quickly,

489
00:35:06,735 --> 00:35:10,155
- Have to go get the rest of them,
- The rest of them?

490
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,574
There are another ten,
I'll be back soon,

491
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,078
Madame Archer,

492
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:18,872
I have a favor to ask of you,

493
00:35:18,956 --> 00:35:22,543
My brother-in-law and his family,
they live near the St, Francis,

494
00:35:22,585 --> 00:35:24,712
On O'Clare, 20,

495
00:35:24,795 --> 00:35:27,714
Can you please get them
and bring them here to me?

496
00:35:27,798 --> 00:35:29,800
- Sure,
- And I have a photo,

497
00:35:31,802 --> 00:35:33,553
Please, keep moving!

498
00:35:37,266 --> 00:35:38,892
- Thanks, Paul,

499
00:35:38,977 --> 00:35:40,812
Please move into the hotel!

500
00:35:40,895 --> 00:35:42,563
Come on, kids, don't be afraid,

501
00:35:42,647 --> 00:35:45,316
- Take them around the back,
- Everyone, keep moving!

502
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,658
Has he spoken to you yet?

503
00:35:53,742 --> 00:35:54,743
No,

504
00:36:08,424 --> 00:36:10,509
Is your face still hurting?

505
00:36:11,552 --> 00:36:12,719
It's all right,

506
00:36:19,268 --> 00:36:21,979
The neighbors asked me
to thank you for your kindness,

507
00:36:24,732 --> 00:36:26,817
I shouldn't have brought them here,

508
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:32,156
The first thing they told me
when I received my appointment

509
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:34,950
was to never, never lower

510
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:39,330
"Maintain the Mille Collines' dignity
at all times, Paul,"

511
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:46,171
Soon all of this will be over,

512
00:36:48,632 --> 00:36:50,800
What if I lose my kob, Tatsi?

513
00:36:53,804 --> 00:36:54,805
Oh, my God!

514
00:36:54,888 --> 00:36:57,098
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back,

515
00:37:17,245 --> 00:37:19,163
Take care of them,

516
00:37:19,247 --> 00:37:20,540
How, sir?

517
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:24,335
Bathe them, feed them,

518
00:37:25,795 --> 00:37:27,088
Put them to bed,

519
00:37:30,258 --> 00:37:31,884
I will send you some help,

520
00:37:36,723 --> 00:37:38,516
Okay, babies,

521
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:41,103
We have heard reports
of reprisal massacres,

522
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:43,646
Will the U,N, intervene
to stop the bloodshed?

523
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,816
We're here as peacekeepers,
not as peacemakers,

524
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,569
My orders are
not to intervene,

525
00:37:50,529 --> 00:37:52,405
- Excuse me,
- Thank you, Colonel,

526
00:37:53,157 --> 00:37:54,241
Here, Over here,

527
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:57,410
Listen, I got us a car,
but we gotta move now,

528
00:37:58,162 --> 00:37:59,830
We're not allowed
to do that, Jack,

529
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:03,250
David, the shit's going down outside
these walls, We gotta cover it,

530
00:38:03,334 --> 00:38:06,420
We're not leaving the hotel grounds
unless we have an armored car,

531
00:38:06,546 --> 00:38:08,714
- That's the ground rules,
- The ground rules?

532
00:38:08,714 --> 00:38:10,590
Where do you think we are,
fucking Wimbledon?

533
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:15,638
We cover the story from here
until we get the proper vehicles, Jack,

534
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:18,182
Shoot some "B" roll of the refugees,

535
00:38:23,813 --> 00:38:25,106
Let's go,

536
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:27,817
Colonel, I have no way
to protect these people,

537
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:30,736
And I have more refugees
than I have room for as it is,

538
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:34,241
I was given 20 orphans today
by the Red Cross,

539
00:38:34,241 --> 00:38:36,326
This is not a refugee camp,

540
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,662
Can you not take them with you
to your facilities?

541
00:38:38,745 --> 00:38:41,956
No, I can't do that, Paul,

542
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,669
I'm overwhelmed
at my refugee camp,

543
00:38:45,753 --> 00:38:48,255
I'm under attack, constant attack,

544
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:52,259
As soon as we can stabilize
this situation, then I'll take 'em,

545
00:38:55,262 --> 00:38:59,891
...and stop the Tutsi cockroaches
who try to run from justice.

546
00:38:59,976 --> 00:39:04,522
The Tutsi cockroach judge
called Makesa is hiding at 4...

547
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:11,528
-... Kabulla and his cockroaches...
- Turn that radio off,

548
00:39:12,238 --> 00:39:13,989
Watch out for him. He--

549
00:39:16,326 --> 00:39:20,163
And get back to work,
We have a hotel to run,

550
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:23,416
There's no work here anyway,
The boss has left,

551
00:39:23,542 --> 00:39:25,168
I am your boss!

552
00:39:38,682 --> 00:39:42,686
Sir, there's a call from the Mille collines
in Rwanda on line one.

553
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:45,314
Yes? Who am I speaking to?

554
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,568
Yes, sir, Paul Rusesabagina,
the house manager,

555
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,778
I met you on your last visit here,
Mr, Tillens,

556
00:39:51,863 --> 00:39:54,574
Ah, yes, Paul, I remember,

557
00:39:54,615 --> 00:39:56,366
How are things there?

558
00:39:56,451 --> 00:39:58,786
The situation is difficult, sir.

559
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:04,291
Some of our directors believe
we should close the Mille Collines

560
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:06,377
until this unrest is over,

561
00:40:06,461 --> 00:40:10,131
I'm not sure about that, Paul.
What do you think?

562
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:16,846
Sir, that would be

563
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:21,226
The Mille Collines is an oasis of calm
for all our loyal customers,

564
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:24,479
What would they think
if Sabena deserted them now?

565
00:40:24,563 --> 00:40:27,691
I assure you, the United Nations
have everything under control, sir,

566
00:40:29,234 --> 00:40:31,027
Very well, Paul,
Very well,

567
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:35,032
But if this thing gets worse,
we must close,

568
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:38,452
If there is anything
I can do, please call,

569
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,581
Sir, yes, there is one thing I'm going
to be needing from you right away,

570
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:47,461
Let me tell you, it was an embarrassment
for me to have to ask for this,

571
00:40:48,296 --> 00:40:52,466
Most of us in this room have known each
other and worked together for many years,

572
00:40:53,635 --> 00:40:57,639
Is it really necessary
for me to get a letter from Belgium

573
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:59,391
for you to perform your duties?

574
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:06,939
In fact, forget this letter,

575
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:11,152
If you don't want to work for me and would
rather be out there, then leave now,

576
00:41:16,366 --> 00:41:19,953
Please, everyone, back to work,

577
00:41:25,793 --> 00:41:27,878
Paul, thank you for coming,

578
00:41:27,878 --> 00:41:31,381
The air conditioner's on the blink, ls
there any way you can have a look at it?

579
00:41:31,465 --> 00:41:33,383
- I'm kust on a deadline,
- Certainly,

580
00:41:33,384 --> 00:41:37,638
Fred, let me know when you
get the satellite feed, Thanks,

581
00:41:38,306 --> 00:41:42,226
Mr, Fleming, I brought you
some tea as well, sir,

582
00:41:42,310 --> 00:41:43,686
Thank you, Paul,

583
00:41:44,938 --> 00:41:47,315
You're an oasis in the desert,

584
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:50,860
...the elements of
the government and army

585
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:54,697
are following the example of what
happened to the Americans in Somalia.

586
00:41:54,781 --> 00:42:00,578
I think they intend to intimidate us,
try to attack us, and...

587
00:42:00,704 --> 00:42:04,291
hope that the West
will pull all its troops out.

588
00:42:04,374 --> 00:42:06,793
- Do you think they'll succeed?
- No, they won 't.

589
00:42:06,877 --> 00:42:08,211
The U. N. 's here to stay.

590
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,963
What about
the outbreak of violence

591
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,007
since the shooting down
of the president's plane?

592
00:42:12,007 --> 00:42:14,843
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

593
00:42:14,927 --> 00:42:18,013
I'm responsible
for the safety of this crew,

594
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:21,850
What is this?

595
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:54,884
- Where did you get this?
- Half a mile down the road,

596
00:42:55,385 --> 00:42:57,220
Fred, it's David,

597
00:42:57,304 --> 00:43:00,140
I've got incredible footage,
It's a massacre,

598
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:02,851
Dead bodies, machetes,

599
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:06,146
If I get this through right away,
can you make the evening news?

600
00:43:07,022 --> 00:43:08,148
Yeah,

601
00:43:13,404 --> 00:43:15,155
You have to lead with this,

602
00:43:16,365 --> 00:43:18,367
I point at you, you do a shot,

603
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:22,455
And you'll get a total double
and see if all the drinking--

604
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,623
- Excuse me, Mr, Daglish,
- Hey, Paul,

605
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,461
Listen, sorry about earlier,

606
00:43:28,461 --> 00:43:31,130
If I'd known you were in there,
I wouldn't have--

607
00:43:31,214 --> 00:43:36,010
I am glad that you have shot this footage
and that the world will see it,

608
00:43:36,136 --> 00:43:39,222
It is the only way we have
a chance that people might intervene,

609
00:43:42,476 --> 00:43:46,772
Yeah, and if no one intervenes,

610
00:43:48,565 --> 00:43:52,485
How can they not intervene
when they witness such atrocities?

611
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:56,948
I think if people see this footage,,,

612
00:43:58,033 --> 00:44:00,702
,,,they'll say, "Oh, my God,
that's horrible,"

613
00:44:00,703 --> 00:44:02,621
and then go on
eating their dinners,

614
00:44:07,335 --> 00:44:10,504
What the hell do I know?
Listen, you wanna kust relax?

615
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:13,257
I have more work to do,
I thank you for your offer,

616
00:44:13,341 --> 00:44:15,509
Please enkoy your evening,
Mr, Daglish,

617
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:22,516
- Help! Please help us! Please!
- Sir! Sir!

618
00:44:22,642 --> 00:44:24,644
We've got trouble at the gate,

619
00:44:27,355 --> 00:44:29,982
Can we have some
medical assistance here, please?

620
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:33,277
That group, come with me,
Move out of the area,

621
00:44:33,361 --> 00:44:35,488
- Here, get up, get up,
- Right, fall back, everybody,

622
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:38,659
Benedict, what is happening?

623
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:41,661
They're killing everyone,
The lady,,,

624
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,497
The lnterhamwe have surrounded
the whole town,

625
00:44:44,623 --> 00:44:45,749
Come on!

626
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,252
Cover the road, Now,

627
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:50,753
Stand your ground,

628
00:44:52,631 --> 00:44:53,673
Hold the line,

629
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:56,052
Do not shoot!
Do not shoot!

630
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:25,332
- Lieutenant, guard this gate,
- Yes, sir,

631
00:45:25,832 --> 00:45:28,835
You two, take up positions
behind those sandbags,

632
00:45:28,919 --> 00:45:34,007
They murdered my men,
I lost ten Belgian U,N, soldiers,

633
00:45:34,091 --> 00:45:36,510
They were protecting
the lady prime minister,

634
00:45:36,635 --> 00:45:38,762
- She is dead?
- Yeah, she's dead,

635
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,767
The Europeans are putting together
an intervention force,

636
00:45:43,851 --> 00:45:45,352
They'll be here in a few days,

637
00:45:45,352 --> 00:45:49,064
I understand that, Colonel, but there is

638
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:50,524
What can I do?

639
00:45:50,650 --> 00:45:53,903
I'll put two more men on the gate,
two of my best lieutenants,

640
00:45:54,821 --> 00:45:56,197
- All right,
- All right,

641
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,990
I understand, Thank you,

642
00:46:07,917 --> 00:46:09,084
Madame Archer,

643
00:46:10,337 --> 00:46:11,421
Hello,

644
00:46:12,631 --> 00:46:15,842
- We were expecting you five days ago,
- I'm sorry,

645
00:46:15,926 --> 00:46:18,345
My brother and his family,
did you find them?

646
00:46:18,428 --> 00:46:21,180
I made it to the house,

647
00:46:21,265 --> 00:46:23,851
- Empty?
- It had been ransacked,

648
00:46:24,977 --> 00:46:28,188
As I left, an old woman,

649
00:46:28,272 --> 00:46:32,359
I went to the house, She has
the two little girls, They're safe,

650
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:33,902
Okay,

651
00:46:33,986 --> 00:46:35,821
But,,,

652
00:46:35,905 --> 00:46:40,284
My brother and his wife--
did the old lady know of them?

653
00:46:43,454 --> 00:46:47,333
My brother is dead,
They would never leave their children,

654
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:51,004
Perhaps they could not make it
home, Tatiana, They are hiding,

655
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,508
Please, can you return
and bring the girls back here to us?

656
00:46:55,675 --> 00:46:59,345
I can't, There are
lnterhamwe roadblocks everywhere,

657
00:47:03,058 --> 00:47:05,060
When I reached the orphanage,,,

658
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:08,355
,,,the lnterhamwe were there,

659
00:47:09,272 --> 00:47:12,066
They'd already started
killing children,

660
00:47:12,901 --> 00:47:14,527
They made me watch,

661
00:47:17,448 --> 00:47:19,450
There was one girl,

662
00:47:19,533 --> 00:47:22,202
she had her little sister
wrapped on her back,

663
00:47:25,998 --> 00:47:29,209
As they were about to chop her,
she cried out to me,

664
00:47:31,671 --> 00:47:33,673
"Please don't let them kill me,

665
00:47:34,924 --> 00:47:37,635
I promise I won't be Tutsi anymore,"

666
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:40,429
Please, I can't,

667
00:47:47,854 --> 00:47:51,899
They're targeting Tutsi children, Paul,
to wipe out the next generation,

668
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:03,495
I've nowhere to take
the orphans, Paul,

669
00:48:03,662 --> 00:48:08,083
Don't worry, There will be
an intervention force coming soon,

670
00:48:09,084 --> 00:48:11,294
We will get the orphans out then,

671
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:25,518
They're here!

672
00:48:31,399 --> 00:48:34,318
They're here! We are safe!

673
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:35,736
Soldiers have arrived!

674
00:48:36,321 --> 00:48:38,948
- Wow, look, it's the French!

675
00:48:39,032 --> 00:48:40,867
Thank goodness!

676
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,328
- Welcome,
- Thank you,

677
00:48:44,412 --> 00:48:45,496
Well done,

678
00:48:48,959 --> 00:48:50,418
About time, gentlemen,

679
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:53,671
Thank you for saving our lives,

680
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,219
It's okay, Roger,

681
00:49:01,472 --> 00:49:05,309
Jean Baptiste, our prayers
have been answered, Thank God,

682
00:49:05,392 --> 00:49:07,102
Yes, finally!

683
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:10,897
See, it's okay,

684
00:49:13,109 --> 00:49:15,403
We can do nothing
from our side,

685
00:49:18,573 --> 00:49:21,325
Sweetheart, I told you
we'd be safe,

686
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:24,119
See? I told you, Yeah,

687
00:49:26,122 --> 00:49:29,417
So, Colonel, what can I get for you?

688
00:49:31,544 --> 00:49:32,795
Something strong,

689
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:34,881
- Scotch?
- Yeah,

690
00:49:38,134 --> 00:49:39,885
Congratulations, Colonel,

691
00:49:41,138 --> 00:49:43,223
You have performed a minor miracle,

692
00:49:45,392 --> 00:49:48,103
- Congratulations, huh?
- Yes, sir,

693
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:53,566
You should spit in my face,

694
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:56,945
Excuse me, Colonel?

695
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:58,864
You're dirt,

696
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:02,951
We think you're dirt, Paul,

697
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:05,954
Who is "we"?

698
00:50:06,956 --> 00:50:10,417
The West, all the superpowers,
everything you believe in, Paul,

699
00:50:10,418 --> 00:50:13,671
They think you're dirt,
they think you're dung, You're worthless,

700
00:50:13,713 --> 00:50:16,257
I'm afraid I don't understand
what you are saying, sir,

701
00:50:16,341 --> 00:50:18,676
Come on, don't bullshit me, Paul,

702
00:50:19,677 --> 00:50:21,470
You're the smartest man here,

703
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:25,474
You got them all eating
out of your hands,

704
00:50:25,558 --> 00:50:29,478
You could own this freakin' hotel,

705
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:30,897
you're black,

706
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:34,401
You're not even a nigger,

707
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:37,320
You're an African,

708
00:50:42,868 --> 00:50:44,786
They're not gonna stay, Paul,

709
00:50:46,664 --> 00:50:48,791
They're not gonna stop this slaughter,

710
00:50:51,335 --> 00:50:52,419
Please,

711
00:50:53,045 --> 00:50:54,254
Got it,

712
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,383
- Hello,
- Hello, Daddy,

713
00:50:59,885 --> 00:51:02,304
Elys, take Diane in the other room,

714
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:07,810
What is it?

715
00:51:13,233 --> 00:51:14,984
All the whites are leaving,

716
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:17,820
They are being evacuated,

717
00:51:18,863 --> 00:51:21,740
But,,,what about us?

718
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,411
We have been abandoned,

719
00:51:24,411 --> 00:51:27,414
But the soldiers
will stop the killers,

720
00:51:27,497 --> 00:51:29,957
Listen, Listen to me, Tatsi, Listen,

721
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:33,253
I said all the whites are leaving--
the French, the ltalians,

722
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,881
even the U,N, Belgian soldiers,
all of them!

723
00:51:38,676 --> 00:51:40,552
Who is left?

724
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,888
I don't know,

725
00:51:44,056 --> 00:51:49,728
Colonel Oliver said he has 300
U,N, peacekeepers for the whole country,

726
00:51:52,106 --> 00:51:54,817
The most he can spare
for the hotel are four men,

727
00:51:56,027 --> 00:51:58,237
And they are not allowed to shoot,

728
00:52:04,035 --> 00:52:05,953
I am a fool,

729
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:08,248
No, No, no,

730
00:52:08,957 --> 00:52:11,960
They told me
I was one of them, and l,,,

731
00:52:14,713 --> 00:52:19,259
Wine, chocolates, cigars, style--
I swallowed it,

732
00:52:19,343 --> 00:52:21,553
I swallowed it,
I swallowed all of it,

733
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:24,973
And they handed me their shit,

734
00:52:29,895 --> 00:52:33,398
I have no history,
I have no memory,

735
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:36,985
I'm a fool, Tatsi,

736
00:52:38,696 --> 00:52:40,698
You are no fool,

737
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:46,328
I know who you are,

738
00:52:50,124 --> 00:52:51,792
News Service Africa.

739
00:52:51,876 --> 00:52:55,546
A United Nations source reports
that the U. S. and British representatives

740
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,341
on the Security council
will lobby for the removal

741
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,011
of all U. N. peacekeepers
from Rwanda.

742
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:23,450
Please, Jack,

743
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,452
Wait, he's British,

744
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,288
Jack, please don't leave me,

745
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,375
Can we talk?
Just one second,

746
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,296
Please, Jack, Please,

747
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:37,923
They'll put me on the street,
They'll chop me,

748

00:53:49,853 --> 00:53:51,521
- Paul!
- They are waiting,

753
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:52,521
Paul,

754
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,109
He won't put you out,
Here, give her anything she wants,

755
00:53:57,152 --> 00:53:59,154
- Anything, Just charge it,
- This is not necessary,

756
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,531
- They're gonna kill us here,
- Let him go,

757
00:54:01,615 --> 00:54:03,533
We have to let him go,

758
00:54:11,375 --> 00:54:13,752
Don't do that, please,

759
00:54:13,836 --> 00:54:15,838
Jesus Christ, I'm so ashamed,

760
00:54:28,017 --> 00:54:30,019
Wait! Wait!

761
00:54:34,732 --> 00:54:36,525
Hold the buses!

762
00:54:36,609 --> 00:54:37,860
Peter!

763
00:54:50,832 --> 00:54:54,168
Thank you for being here,
Thank you very much, Thank you,

764
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:56,379
- No Rwandans,
- What?

765
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:59,174
Foreign nationals only,
Sorry, Father, those were the orders,

766
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:02,927
- But you can't leave the children behind,
- Sorry, Father, we have our orders,

767
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:04,470
- You can't leave them!
- We can do no more,

768
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:06,389
Father, it is of no use,

769
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,768
These men are not here--
They are not here to help us,

770
00:55:09,852 --> 00:55:11,436
Please, there is nothing we can do,

771
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,772
Get your people on the bus,
I will take care of the others,

772
00:55:13,856 --> 00:55:15,858
It is of no use, Father,

773
00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:22,281
No, no, no,

774
00:55:22,365 --> 00:55:24,033
To the hotel,
To the hotel,

775
00:55:28,162 --> 00:55:31,165
Sir, please, don't touch the camera,
We have the right to film,

776
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,918
- No filming,
- Go to the hotel,

777
00:55:34,002 --> 00:55:35,461
Go inside,

778
00:55:36,546 --> 00:55:39,549
Go inside the hotel,

779
00:55:39,633 --> 00:55:41,927
Yes, you can stay, yes,
We will take care of you,

780
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,845
Go into the hotel,

781
00:55:48,308 --> 00:55:49,309
No!

782
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:54,189
Go to the hotel,
Go inside, Go inside the hotel,

783
00:56:43,157 --> 00:56:45,451
Excuse me, Excuse me,

784
00:56:49,747 --> 00:56:51,999
- Sir,
- Come, Dube,

785
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:56,086
- Please, everyone inside,
- Please, people, let's go inside,

786
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:59,089
Out of the rain, please,
Come, sister, come,

787
00:57:04,929 --> 00:57:05,930
Paul,

788
00:57:10,184 --> 00:57:11,602
I want you to go,

789
00:57:13,104 --> 00:57:14,438
Go where?

790
00:57:17,025 --> 00:57:21,279
You take the children,
You go get the girls,

791
00:57:21,363 --> 00:57:23,448
- Your card says Hutu--
- What are you saying?

792
00:57:23,532 --> 00:57:27,035
Please, please,
You pay money at the roadblocks,

793
00:57:27,035 --> 00:57:29,037
I want you to go,

794
00:57:29,037 --> 00:57:30,788
No, Tatiana, no,

795
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,791
I will never leave you,

796
00:57:36,795 --> 00:57:38,505
I will never leave you,

797
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,429
Oh, Tatsi,

798
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:52,561
Let us sleep, my wife,
Let us sleep,

799
00:58:05,909 --> 00:58:07,785
Get up, Get up,

800
00:58:07,827 --> 00:58:09,495
Get up, get up, get up,

801
00:58:11,498 --> 00:58:15,126
- Are you the manager?
- Yes, sir, What's the matter?

802
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:18,880
Everyone must leave the hotel now,

803
00:58:18,964 --> 00:58:21,132
- Why?
- Papa, what's wrong?

804
00:58:21,216 --> 00:58:22,509
It's an order,

805
00:58:24,052 --> 00:58:28,056
I need some time--
20, 30 minutes--to take a shower,

806
00:58:29,516 --> 00:58:32,644
- Sir, people are still sleeping,
- I don't care,

807
00:58:34,647 --> 00:58:38,776
Please, let me get you some beers,
You and your boys,

808
00:58:38,901 --> 00:58:41,987
And I'll be down right away, all right?
As quick as I can,

809
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:44,991
- Ten minutes,
- Yes, sir, ten minutes,

810
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:49,203
- Get out of the way,
- Quick, children, quickly,

811
00:58:49,328 --> 00:58:52,414
- Roger's not here,
- Where is he? Where's Roger?

812
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:53,582
Under the bed,

813
00:58:55,043 --> 00:58:57,503
Roger, It's Papa,

814
00:58:57,504 --> 00:58:59,422
They've gone,
They've gone, they've gone,

815
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:01,841
Come, come, Come on,

816
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:08,348
Oh, my darling,
It's okay, sweetie, It's okay,

817
00:59:08,431 --> 00:59:10,641
Come on, it's okay, It's okay,

818
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:13,353
- Go to the roof, Tatiana,

819
00:59:13,437 --> 00:59:15,522
Yes, yes,
go to the roof right now,

820
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:18,983
Yes, good day,
General Bizimungu, please,

821
00:59:20,152 --> 00:59:21,903
He is where?

822
00:59:21,987 --> 00:59:24,072
No, that is unacceptable,

823
00:59:24,073 --> 00:59:25,824
Who would order such a thing?

824
00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:30,162
Yes, did you find the general?

825
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:36,043
Gentlemen, please have some beer,

826
00:59:36,127 --> 00:59:37,795
Get me the guest list,

827
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:40,130
Yes, sir,

828
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:43,968
Yes?

829
00:59:44,052 --> 00:59:47,972
Sorry, sir, but I have a call
from Paul in Kigali. He says it's urgent.

830
00:59:48,056 --> 00:59:49,974
Paul, are you all right?

831
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:51,517
We have a big problem, sir.

832
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:52,768
What?

833
00:59:52,811 --> 00:59:54,979
The Hutu army have come,

834
00:59:55,063 --> 00:59:57,565
They've ordered us--
all of us--out of the hotel,

835
00:59:57,566 --> 00:59:59,442
Why are they doing this?

836
00:59:59,484 --> 01:00:01,986
I think they will kill us all,

837
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:02,987
Kill?

838
01:00:04,656 --> 01:00:08,326
What do you mean,,,all?
How many?

839
01:00:08,410 --> 01:00:13,206
We have 100 staff
and now more than 800 guests,

840
01:00:13,332 --> 01:00:15,334
- 800?!
- Yes, sir.

841
01:00:15,417 --> 01:00:18,586
There are now 800 Tutsi
and Hutu refugees.

842
01:00:18,671 --> 01:00:21,215
I do not have much time left, sir,

843
01:00:24,969 --> 01:00:26,887
I want to thank you

844
01:00:26,971 --> 01:00:29,223
for everything that you
have done for me and my family,

845
01:00:29,348 --> 01:00:32,434
and please thank all
of my friends at Sabena.

846
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:35,521
Paul, wait,

847
01:00:36,064 --> 01:00:38,900
I'm gonna put you on hold,
Stay by the phone,

848
01:00:39,984 --> 01:00:42,778
- Where are your papers?
- We don't have any papers, sir,

849
01:00:42,904 --> 01:00:46,157
We don't have any papers,
They got burnt in the house,

850
01:00:47,075 --> 01:00:49,661
Louis, get on to the U,N,
Tell them what's happening,

851
01:00:49,828 --> 01:00:51,246
Did you need something, sir?

852
01:00:51,329 --> 01:00:55,666
Mary, call the prime minister's office,
Tell them I must speak with him now,

853
01:00:55,834 --> 01:00:56,918
Okay,

854
01:01:00,422 --> 01:01:01,965
Paul, are you there?

855
01:01:02,466 --> 01:01:03,467
Yes, sir,

856
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,218
Who can I call to stop this?

857
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:10,849
The French,
They supply the Hutu army,

858
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:16,063
Do everything you can to buy time,
I'll call you right back,

859
01:01:20,193 --> 01:01:22,737
What are you doing, Dube?

860
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:25,740
The lieutenant, sir,

861
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:31,995
- Go and get these boys some more beer,
- Thirsty, boy? You like beer?

862
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:33,414
Thank you,

863
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:37,626
Come with me, please,

864
01:01:42,299 --> 01:01:44,426
Sir, that was two weeks ago,

865
01:01:49,723 --> 01:01:51,224
Here you are, sir,

866
01:01:54,144 --> 01:01:56,479
Anderson, Arthurs, Boulier,,,

867
01:01:57,856 --> 01:01:59,357
What is this?

868
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:03,778
It is the guest list, sir,

869
01:02:04,822 --> 01:02:06,907
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

870
01:02:06,991 --> 01:02:12,079
No, We stopped taking names
after the president was murdered,

871
01:02:12,163 --> 01:02:15,624
- This is the only guest list, sir,
- There are no Europeans left!

872
01:02:16,751 --> 01:02:21,088
Get me the names
of all the cockroaches in there now,

873
01:02:22,006 --> 01:02:24,925
- That will take time,
- We don't have time,

874
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:29,680
If I don't have the names
so that I can pick out the traitors,

875
01:02:29,764 --> 01:02:32,600
then I'll kill everyone in there,

876
01:02:34,102 --> 01:02:35,603
Starting with you,

877
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:37,897
Leave,

878
01:02:40,317 --> 01:02:41,359
Yes, sir,

879
01:02:53,622 --> 01:02:55,040
Yes, sir,

880
01:02:55,708 --> 01:02:56,792
Who did you call?

881
01:02:58,044 --> 01:03:00,379
- Who did I call?
- Don't lie to me!

882
01:03:02,715 --> 01:03:04,717
What is your name?

883
01:03:04,800 --> 01:03:07,135
Rusesabagina,

884
01:03:08,221 --> 01:03:10,223
Paul Rusesabagina,

885
01:03:10,723 --> 01:03:12,516
I'll remember you,

886
01:03:13,810 --> 01:03:15,186
I'll remember you,

887
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:19,899
- Let's go,
- Come on, we're leaving,

888
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:30,452
They've gone,

889
01:03:33,789 --> 01:03:35,207
Paul, Paul,

890
01:03:37,876 --> 01:03:39,836
I was afraid for you,

891
01:03:41,213 --> 01:03:44,841
Sir, the president of Sabena
is on the phone for you,

892
01:03:46,218 --> 01:03:48,178
I must talk with this man,

893
01:03:54,018 --> 01:03:56,729
- Mr, Tillens,
- Paul, what's going on?

894
01:03:56,813 --> 01:04:00,149
They left, Thank you, sir,
What did you do?

895
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:03,319
I got through to the French
president's office,

896
01:04:05,572 --> 01:04:07,907
Well, thank you,
You have saved our lives,

897
01:04:08,741 --> 01:04:13,370
I pleaded with the French and
the Belgians to go back and get you all,

898
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:16,916
I am afraid this is not
going to happen.

899
01:04:18,585 --> 01:04:21,087
They're cowards, Paul,

900
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:25,758
Rwanda is not worth
a single vote to any of them,

901
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,096
The French, the British,

902
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:32,849
I am sorry, Paul,

903
01:04:35,102 --> 01:04:36,228
Thank you,

904
01:04:39,857 --> 01:04:41,483
There will be no rescue,,,

905
01:04:42,943 --> 01:04:44,903
,,,no intervention for us,

906
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:48,782
We can only save ourselves,

907
01:04:49,992 --> 01:04:52,160
Many of you know
influential people abroad,

908
01:04:52,245 --> 01:04:53,746
You must call these people,

909
01:04:53,788 --> 01:04:56,832
Please, fax this

910
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:59,627
You must tell them
what will happen to us,

911
01:05:01,296 --> 01:05:02,797
Say good-bye,

912
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:07,510
But when you say good-bye,

913
01:05:07,594 --> 01:05:12,766
say it as though you are reaching
through the phone and holding their hand,

914
01:05:13,642 --> 01:05:16,353
Let them know that
if they let go of that hand,,,

915
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:19,939
,,,you will die,

916
01:05:23,318 --> 01:05:27,030
We must shame them
into sending help,

917
01:05:29,492 --> 01:05:34,455
Most importantly,
this cannot be a refugee camp,

918
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:38,626
The lnterhamwe believe that the
Mille Collines is a four-star Sabena hotel,

919
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:42,380
That is the only thing
that is keeping us alive,

920
01:05:42,463 --> 01:05:44,381
Have you printed the bills?

921
01:05:45,883 --> 01:05:48,385
Thank you,
Now please erase the register,

922
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:51,472
- Erase it?
- Yes, I want no names to appear there,

923
01:05:52,182 --> 01:05:54,184
Boss, the carpenters are ready,

924
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:56,977
Tell them to remove
all of the numbers from the doors,

925
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:59,063
- And put what?
- And put nothing,

926
01:06:06,905 --> 01:06:09,574
Good day,
Here is your bill for the last week,

927
01:06:09,658 --> 01:06:12,327
If you cannot pay
or think you will not be able to pay,

928
01:06:12,369 --> 01:06:15,789
please go to the banquet room and
Dube will take care of you, Thank you,

929
01:06:19,919 --> 01:06:22,379
Does the State Department
have a view

930
01:06:22,463 --> 01:06:26,675
as to whether or not
what is happening could be genocide?

931
01:06:26,717 --> 01:06:30,137
We have every reason to believe
that acts of genocide have occurred.

932
01:06:30,221 --> 01:06:34,934
How many acts of genocide
does it take to make genocide?

933
01:06:35,017 --> 01:06:38,020
Alan, that's just not a question
that I'm in a position to answer.

934
01:06:38,104 --> 01:06:41,691
Is it true that you
have specific guidance

935
01:06:41,733 --> 01:06:44,235
not to use the word "genocide"
in isolation,

936
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:46,905
but always to preface it
with this word "acts of"?

937
01:06:48,448 --> 01:06:53,536
I have guidance
which I try to use as best as I can.

938
01:06:53,578 --> 01:06:55,162
I have--

939
01:06:55,247 --> 01:06:57,666
There are formulations
that we are using

940
01:06:57,749 --> 01:07:00,710
that we are trying to be
consistent in our use of--

941
01:07:03,338 --> 01:07:05,131
I'm sorry it is not Glenmorangie,

942
01:07:06,258 --> 01:07:07,884
As long as it is scotch,

943
01:07:10,221 --> 01:07:13,933
Your white friends
have abandoned you,

944
01:07:15,684 --> 01:07:18,353
- So it would seem,
- Well, don't worry,

945
01:07:18,437 --> 01:07:21,732
- I will take care of you,
- I'm glad to hear that

946
01:07:21,774 --> 01:07:24,735
because I was wondering if perhaps
you could spare us a few policemen,

947
01:07:24,777 --> 01:07:25,986
To protect us, sir,

948
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,073
- The police are very busy, Paul,
- Yes, I'm aware of this,

949
01:07:29,115 --> 01:07:32,410
But when I last spoke
to the president of Sabena,

950
01:07:32,452 --> 01:07:35,872
he assured me that anyone
who helped protect Belgian property

951
01:07:35,955 --> 01:07:37,414
would be well rewarded,

952
01:07:38,458 --> 01:07:39,792
I will see what I can do,

953
01:07:40,961 --> 01:07:42,587
Excuse me momentarily, sir,

954
01:07:44,339 --> 01:07:46,132
Where has all our beer gone?

955
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:49,845
Sir, Gregoire has been taking beer,

956
01:07:50,554 --> 01:07:51,972
How much beer?

957
01:07:52,890 --> 01:07:53,974
Many,

958
01:07:57,352 --> 01:08:00,313
,,,come down to the reception,
And then he says to me,

959
01:08:00,356 --> 01:08:01,982
"How do you want the girls?"

960
01:08:03,984 --> 01:08:06,903
There's our cockroach manager,
Always kissing ass,

961
01:08:12,618 --> 01:08:13,785
General,,,

962
01:08:15,496 --> 01:08:17,247
I'm glad you came by,

963
01:08:17,999 --> 01:08:20,501
I overheard something
that I think you should know about,

964
01:08:20,543 --> 01:08:21,794
What did you overhear?

965
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:26,132
It was a discussion between a U,N, Colonel
and an American Embassy official,

966
01:08:26,174 --> 01:08:27,592
And what did they say?

967
01:08:27,675 --> 01:08:30,511
The American assured the colonel
that they would watch everything,

968
01:08:30,553 --> 01:08:32,137
How? They have gone, Paul,

969
01:08:32,180 --> 01:08:35,308
With their spies, Satellites,

970
01:08:37,811 --> 01:08:39,646
Americans,

971
01:08:39,688 --> 01:08:41,606
Oh, Gregoire!

972
01:08:45,402 --> 01:08:47,320
You know, I admire you, General,

973
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:50,824
How do you keep command
of your men amid such madness?

974
01:08:50,866 --> 01:08:54,661
- I am a strong man, Paul,
- I wish I were more like you,

975
01:08:55,579 --> 01:08:57,956
- I mean, look at my staff,
- Cheers,

976
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:00,667
He won't work,

977
01:09:00,751 --> 01:09:03,337
- He is staff?
- Oh, yes,

978
01:09:03,421 --> 01:09:04,422
Yes,

979
01:09:15,183 --> 01:09:17,351
Get back to work, you slug! Go!

980
01:09:18,728 --> 01:09:20,146
Satellites?

981
01:09:21,314 --> 01:09:24,817
What was I going to say, that
the Americans were hiding in the trees?

982
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:40,667
- What's the matter?
- I have to go out and get food,

983
01:09:40,751 --> 01:09:44,671
- Go out? Where?
- To George Rutaganda's place,

984
01:09:44,755 --> 01:09:46,882
No, No, no,

985
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:48,759
I have to, Tatiana,

986
01:09:48,843 --> 01:09:51,470
We are only as valuable
as the money we give to him,

987
01:09:51,554 --> 01:09:53,222
You cannot go alone,

988
01:09:54,098 --> 01:09:57,726
I'm not going alone,
I'll take Gregoire with me,

989
01:09:57,810 --> 01:10:01,063
He's a good Hutu,
and he wants to impress me now,

990
01:10:10,907 --> 01:10:13,075
It is good to see you
back at work, Gregoire,

991
01:10:13,118 --> 01:10:16,204
- Please, sir, accept my humblest apologies,
- Please, please,

992
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:18,915
We have a kob this morning,

993
01:10:18,957 --> 01:10:21,292
We are going
to see George Rutaganda,

994
01:10:22,377 --> 01:10:23,711
Please get the van,

995
01:10:43,482 --> 01:10:44,941
Show me your l,D,

996
01:10:45,026 --> 01:10:47,528
Remember how those Tutsi women
used to look down

997
01:10:47,612 --> 01:10:50,615
their long noses at Hutu men?
Now they beg for their lives.

998
01:10:50,698 --> 01:10:53,242
I'm here to see my friend
George Rutaganda,

999
01:10:53,326 --> 01:10:57,663
I say taste those
Tutsi whores before they die.

1000
01:10:57,747 --> 01:11:01,292
Then they'll know
what Hutu power is, my warriors.

1001
01:11:01,334 --> 01:11:05,129
Remember, one cockroach
can start an infestation.

1002
01:11:05,171 --> 01:11:07,673
We need to exterminate these vermin.

1003
01:11:38,372 --> 01:11:40,749
Hey, Paul, my old friend,

1004
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:48,174
Tutsi prostitutes and witches,
So, what can I do for you?

1005
01:11:48,883 --> 01:11:51,510
- I need supplies, George,
- Anytime,

1006
01:11:56,558 --> 01:12:00,186
Paul, everything is double the price now,
You understand that?

1007
01:12:00,228 --> 01:12:03,397
Yes, I need rice, beans,

1008
01:12:03,482 --> 01:12:06,902
powdered milk, beer,
and your best whiskey,

1009
01:12:08,070 --> 01:12:11,531
Beer yes, but whiskey no,

1010
01:12:11,615 --> 01:12:13,199
You have no whiskey?

1011
01:12:13,242 --> 01:12:15,953
No whiskey, no spirits,

1012
01:12:16,036 --> 01:12:20,749
Your,,,rich guests will have to do
without their scotch,

1013
01:12:21,375 --> 01:12:24,878
Anyway, Paul,
I have bled that cow enough now,

1014
01:12:25,963 --> 01:12:27,506
What are you saying, George?

1015
01:12:27,590 --> 01:12:33,179
Your rich cockroaches at the hotel,

1016
01:12:34,013 --> 01:12:36,265
Soon all the Tutsis will be dead,

1017
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:42,105
You do not honestly believe
that you can kill them all?

1018
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:44,857
And why not?

1019
01:12:46,484 --> 01:12:48,068
Why not?

1020
01:12:48,153 --> 01:12:50,655
We are halfway there already,

1021
01:12:53,450 --> 01:12:56,327
So, Paul, you want
12 bags of rice?

1022
01:12:57,537 --> 01:13:00,123
Give him 12 bags of rice
and 4 crates of beer,

1023
01:13:00,207 --> 01:13:01,708
Yes, sir, right away,

1024
01:13:03,252 --> 01:13:09,007
Oh, and, Paul, I'll give you a crate
of soft drinks for the kids free of charge,

1025
01:13:10,509 --> 01:13:11,593
Yes,

1026
01:13:13,345 --> 01:13:16,139
Ten bags of beans,
Come, quick,

1027
01:13:16,766 --> 01:13:19,226
And put those in the van, You,

1028
01:13:20,853 --> 01:13:22,855
Let me give you
a little tip, my friend,

1029
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:25,650
Our generals in army say,
"Don't go near the Mille Collines

1030
01:13:25,733 --> 01:13:27,901
or they will send
the Belgian soldiers back here,"

1031
01:13:27,985 --> 01:13:32,281
But soon those generals will
have gone and we will be in charge,

1032
01:13:33,491 --> 01:13:37,745
It's time to butcher that fat cow
of yours for the meat,

1033
01:13:48,632 --> 01:13:50,050
Let's go,

1034
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:54,972
Maybe you could help us, Paul,

1035
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:57,932
You have some very important
traitors at that hotel,

1036
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,435
Now, if we were to get them,

1037
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:04,314
then maybe we would let you have
one or two cockroaches of your own,

1038
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,651
Do you understand?

1039
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:12,489
It is almost dawn, George,

1040
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,658
We really must be going,

1041
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:19,621
Take the river road back,
It's clear,

1042
01:14:41,353 --> 01:14:43,939
- Gregoire,
- What is going on now?

1043
01:14:44,022 --> 01:14:46,232
- You've driven off the road,
- No, I'm on the road,

1044
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:49,152
You're going to put us in the river,
Stop the car, stop the car,

1045
01:16:13,698 --> 01:16:15,408
Back up the car, Gregoire,

1046
01:16:17,285 --> 01:16:18,452
Listen to me,

1047
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:23,249
You will tell no one
what you have seen here today,

1048
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,709
No one, Gregoire,

1049
01:16:41,018 --> 01:16:45,022
Dube, Please help Gregoire
to unload the van, Thank you,

1050
01:17:19,349 --> 01:17:20,767
Oh, dear,

1051
01:17:52,884 --> 01:17:54,177
Oh, God!

1052
01:17:57,389 --> 01:17:58,598
Oh, God!

1053
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,142
- Sir,
- Dube!

1054
01:18:01,226 --> 01:18:05,063
- Sir, are you okay?
- Don't come in, Don't come in,

1055
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:07,149
I'll be out in a minute,

1056
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:11,236
- Sir, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm all right, Dube,

1057
01:18:12,154 --> 01:18:13,947
Don't come in, I'll be out,

1058
01:18:48,274 --> 01:18:49,525
Hundreds,

1059
01:18:52,279 --> 01:18:54,364
It was too many to count,

1060
01:18:57,909 --> 01:19:00,369
Why are people so cruel?

1061
01:19:04,333 --> 01:19:05,500
Hatred,

1062
01:19:06,960 --> 01:19:08,795
Insanity, I don't know,

1063
01:19:14,510 --> 01:19:15,552
There you go,

1064
01:19:15,636 --> 01:19:17,930
Is she putting
her fingers in the soup?

1065
01:19:17,972 --> 01:19:19,890
Oh, yes,

1066
01:19:21,058 --> 01:19:23,560
,,,to do with you,
Nothing to do with me,

1067
01:19:23,644 --> 01:19:25,020
I remember,,,

1068
01:19:26,147 --> 01:19:27,857
No, no, no, you make a mistake,

1069
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:29,608
- Hello,
- Come with me,

1070
01:19:31,653 --> 01:19:33,571
- Where are we going?
- Just come,

1071
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:51,756
It's beautiful,

1072
01:19:53,759 --> 01:19:55,010
You like it?

1073
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:06,897
I hear we must pay for everything,

1074
01:20:06,981 --> 01:20:08,482
Yes, this is true,

1075
01:20:09,775 --> 01:20:13,278
So,,,how much for this?

1076
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:16,782
A kiss,

1077
01:20:28,628 --> 01:20:33,466
You are a good man,
Paul Rusesabagina,

1078
01:20:50,150 --> 01:20:51,734
I have a confession,

1079
01:20:53,821 --> 01:20:55,823
When you worked as the nurse,,,

1080
01:20:55,906 --> 01:20:58,033
- In Ruhengeri?
- Yes,

1081
01:20:58,117 --> 01:21:00,160
When we first met,,,

1082
01:21:01,746 --> 01:21:04,206
I had you transferred to Kigali,

1083
01:21:06,584 --> 01:21:07,918
What?

1084
01:21:08,878 --> 01:21:13,382
I bribed the Minister of Health
to have you transferred to Kigali,

1085
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:17,846
- Why?
- To be closer,

1086
01:21:19,305 --> 01:21:21,056
So that I could marry you,

1087
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:29,065
What was the bribe?

1088
01:21:31,860 --> 01:21:35,029
- What am I worth to you?
- It was substantial,

1089
01:21:35,113 --> 01:21:37,949
- Tell me what it was,
- A car,

1090
01:21:40,035 --> 01:21:42,871
- What sort of car?
- What does that matter?

1091
01:21:42,955 --> 01:21:44,790
I want to know,

1092
01:21:46,375 --> 01:21:47,959
A Volkswagen,

1093
01:21:52,965 --> 01:21:54,299
I hope it was a new one,

1094
01:22:19,409 --> 01:22:22,578
We have had a good life,
you and l, Yes,

1095
01:22:25,540 --> 01:22:30,128
I thank God every day
for the time we've had,

1096
01:22:36,176 --> 01:22:40,096
- We have to have a plan,
- A plan?

1097
01:22:41,974 --> 01:22:44,977
Our children cannot
see us die first,

1098
01:22:45,019 --> 01:22:48,439
If the militia come, you must
come up here as quick as you can,

1099
01:22:48,522 --> 01:22:51,149
- Please, I don't want to--

1100
01:22:51,234 --> 01:22:54,195
- I don't want you to talk like this, please,
- We have to, Tatiana,

1101
01:22:55,988 --> 01:22:58,365
If I do not make it,

1102
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:01,243
you must take all of our children
by the hand,,,

1103
01:23:03,037 --> 01:23:04,371
,,,and you must kump,

1104
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:09,711
- What are you saying? I could never--
- You have to, Tatiana,

1105
01:23:09,794 --> 01:23:12,588
- You have to promise me,
- What are you saying?

1106
01:23:12,631 --> 01:23:15,967
Tatiana, the machete is no way to die,
You have to promise me you will do it,

1107
01:23:16,051 --> 01:23:17,761
I cannot do--

1108
01:23:17,803 --> 01:23:20,555
You have to
promise me, Tatiana, Please,

1109
01:23:20,639 --> 01:23:22,223
Promise me you will do it,

1110
01:23:25,853 --> 01:23:27,688
Please, Tatiana,

1111
01:23:30,858 --> 01:23:31,984
Yes,

1112
01:23:34,862 --> 01:23:36,572
I'm sorry, I love you,

1113
01:23:38,324 --> 01:23:39,658
I love you,

1114
01:23:47,542 --> 01:23:49,001
I'm gonna get you!

1115
01:23:50,461 --> 01:23:52,463
Diane, Elys, you know better,

1116
01:23:52,547 --> 01:23:55,049
No one can be at the front
of the hotel, I have told you this,

1117
01:23:55,133 --> 01:23:57,427
- Take these children in the back, Hurry,
- Sorry, Papa,

1118
01:23:58,636 --> 01:24:00,471
- Come, children, Come,

1119
01:24:03,225 --> 01:24:06,436
Paul, I've got good news,

Now, certainly Odette
and Jean Baptiste are on the list,

1138
01:25:00,951 --> 01:25:03,787
I'm sorry, Jean, Odette,

1139
01:25:04,955 --> 01:25:08,542
But I have been assured
there will be another plane soon,

1140
01:25:08,625 --> 01:25:09,584
Excuse me,

1141
01:25:12,129 --> 01:25:15,173
Don't worry, Tatsi,
we'll make it to the next list,

1142

01:25:30,815 --> 01:25:32,149
What have you brought us?

1145
01:25:32,191 --> 01:25:35,527
Antibiotics, medical supplies,
general first aid,

1146
01:25:35,612 --> 01:25:37,113
Thank you,

1147
01:25:37,155 --> 01:25:39,657
- I hear there's to be a convoy,
- Yes,

1148
01:25:39,741 --> 01:25:41,451
Are you on the list?

1149
01:25:44,955 --> 01:25:49,668
Madame Archer, I have

1150
01:25:50,669 --> 01:25:53,922
Is there any way that you
could return to the old woman

1151
01:25:54,006 --> 01:25:55,966
and bring the girls
back here to us?

1152
01:25:56,049 --> 01:26:00,011
Paul, that side of town has been

1153
01:26:00,971 --> 01:26:02,305
They're probably dead,

1154
01:26:05,351 --> 01:26:08,687
Madame Archer, I'm begging you,
Those girls have no one now,

1155
01:26:12,483 --> 01:26:13,984
I'll try,

1156
01:26:15,111 --> 01:26:17,196
We have to leave by 7 a,m,

1157
01:26:17,697 --> 01:26:19,824
Who'll take care
of the orphans when you're gone?

1158
01:26:19,866 --> 01:26:23,536
Odette, Odette will care for them
until we can get them out of here,

1159

News Service Africa.
Today a Red cross representative

claimed that the death rate
in the Rwandan conflict

1165
01:26:55,486 --> 01:26:59,031
may have climbed to as many
as 500,000 victims.

1166
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:01,533
One report stated
that 40, 000 bodies

1167
01:27:01,575 --> 01:27:03,827
had been removed
from Lake Victoria.

1168
01:27:05,705 --> 01:27:06,706
Where is she?

1169
01:27:06,789 --> 01:27:10,584
I don't know,
We wait until seven,

1170
01:27:10,626 --> 01:27:13,045
If she is not back
with the girls by then,,,

1171
01:27:14,422 --> 01:27:15,881

Please, Paul, the girls,
We wait a little longer,

1185
01:27:56,132 --> 01:27:58,134
We cannot wait,
We cannot wait, Tatsi,

1186
01:27:58,217 --> 01:27:59,218
There you go,

1187
01:27:59,844 --> 01:28:01,178
Let's move out!

1188
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:06,225
Good luck, sir,

1189
01:28:17,654 --> 01:28:22,242
I am not leaving, You hold Tatiana,
Take care of my family,

1190
01:28:28,415 --> 01:28:29,916
Paul, Paul!

1191

I cannot leave these people to die,

1192
01:28:34,671 --> 01:28:35,922
Papa!

1193

Roger! Roger, I will follow
on the next flight,

01:28:39,009 --> 01:28:41,803
No, don't leave me! Paul!

1195
01:28:41,846 --> 01:28:45,307
Don't worry, Don't worry, children,
Your father's going to be okay,

1196
01:28:45,391 --> 01:28:46,433
Papa!

1197
01:28:46,517 --> 01:28:50,270
- Don't worry, He's okay,
- I want Papa!

1198
01:28:50,354 --> 01:28:51,813
It's okay,

1199
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:20,676
I say those Hutus
who shelter the cockroaches

1200
01:29:20,719 --> 01:29:23,054
are the same as cockroaches.

1201
01:29:25,224 --> 01:29:27,059
- They are all the same.
- This is crazy,

1202
01:29:27,142 --> 01:29:31,187
Their fate should be the same.
This is RTLM.

1203
01:29:42,241 --> 01:29:46,411
The Tutsi cockroaches
of the rebel army must be denied recruits.

1204
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:50,083
come on, good Hutus.
The graves are not yet full.

1205
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:53,043
- Who will help us fill them?
- That goddamn radio station,

1206
01:29:54,128 --> 01:29:57,423
Okay, Y eah, they are
going to the airport,

1207
01:30:00,969 --> 01:30:05,014
Stand by your radios.
I am hearing some urgent news.

1208
01:30:06,224 --> 01:30:09,310
- Boss! Please, come quick!
- Not now, Dube,

1209
01:30:09,394 --> 01:30:12,355
It is important! It is on the radio,
You have to hear it,

1210
01:30:13,732 --> 01:30:16,985
We have received reports
of very important cockroaches

1211
01:30:17,069 --> 01:30:20,906
and traitors trying to escape
from the Mille collines Hotel.

1212
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:22,491
Gather up your weapons.

1213
01:30:22,574 --> 01:30:25,743
Stand by your radios.
We will keep you informed.

1214
01:30:25,786 --> 01:30:29,039
- They are being smuggled away...
- No, no! Who told them of this, Dube?

1215
01:30:29,123 --> 01:30:32,376
I saw Gregoire, sir, It is Gregoire,
I saw him leaving in our bus,

1216
01:30:41,970 --> 01:30:44,430
Please, sir,

1217
01:30:44,514 --> 01:30:47,100
I say who leaves that hotel,
and no one else,

1218
01:30:49,519 --> 01:30:52,438
General Bizimungu,
they are driving into an ambush,

1219
01:31:12,835 --> 01:31:14,002
Slow down,

1220
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,464
Stay calm,

1221
01:31:18,090 --> 01:31:20,008
- What is happening?
- We're stopping,

1222
01:31:22,178 --> 01:31:24,388
You have got cockroaches
in these trucks,

1223
01:31:24,472 --> 01:31:26,849
No, no, I've got
U,N, personnel in these trucks,

1224
01:31:26,891 --> 01:31:29,143
I've got permission to go
through these roadblocks,

1225
01:31:29,185 --> 01:31:32,521
- I'm going to search these trucks,
- You are not going to search this convoy,

1226
01:31:34,190 --> 01:31:36,317
- I am,
- Cover me,

1227
01:31:43,366 --> 01:31:44,825
Go to the back,

1228
01:31:50,874 --> 01:31:54,502
Get away from that truck,
Get away from that truck! Now!

1229
01:32:04,054 --> 01:32:06,181
Get back!
You're not to hurt these people,

1230
01:32:07,766 --> 01:32:09,267
Get back! Move back!

1231
01:32:09,935 --> 01:32:12,354
Look, I told you,
you've got cockroaches in your truck,

1232
01:32:12,396 --> 01:32:16,066
No, no, no, They're political refugees
under U,N, sanction,

1233
01:32:19,695 --> 01:32:23,865
News has come to us
that we have cowards in our own army

1234
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:26,076
who will not let us punish them.

1235
01:32:29,247 --> 01:32:30,248
No!

1236
01:32:32,375 --> 01:32:34,377
You're moving cockroaches
from Mille Collines?

1237
01:32:34,419 --> 01:32:36,921
No, sir, No, sir,

1238
01:32:36,963 --> 01:32:40,049
- They cannot leave Mille Collines,
- They are not leaving,

1239
01:32:40,926 --> 01:32:41,927
Stop him!

1240
01:32:44,304 --> 01:32:45,680
You bastard!

1241
01:32:51,436 --> 01:32:52,520
What's your name?

1242
01:32:52,604 --> 01:32:54,939
- What's your name?
- I can't think,,,

1243
01:32:55,774 --> 01:32:58,735
- Kill them!
- Get everybody out of here! Move it!

1244
01:32:58,777 --> 01:33:01,613
What's your name?
What's your name?

1245
01:33:02,239 --> 01:33:03,573
Let's move! Drive!

1246
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:05,409
Move! Get out!

1247
01:33:05,451 --> 01:33:06,952
Out, or I'll shoot!

1248
01:33:10,206 --> 01:33:11,207
Get out!

1249
01:33:14,961 --> 01:33:16,587
Drive, drive! Let's go!

1250
01:33:17,505 --> 01:33:19,507
Help us get out of here,

1251
01:33:19,591 --> 01:33:21,342
Clear the street!

1252
01:33:30,936 --> 01:33:33,605
I am receiving more news,
good Hutus.

1253
01:33:33,688 --> 01:33:37,525
I have learned that
the traitor Rusesabagina's cockroaches

1254
01:33:37,609 --> 01:33:38,985
are on a truck.

1255
01:33:39,069 --> 01:33:41,279
1 0,000 francs for their heads!

1256
01:33:43,574 --> 01:33:46,243
Stay still,
Give me your shirt, quickly,

1257
01:33:55,795 --> 01:33:57,797
Come on, Paul,

1258
01:33:57,880 --> 01:34:00,924
Come on, here, here,

1259
01:34:03,469 --> 01:34:04,762
Please, please,

1260
01:34:04,804 --> 01:34:07,640
- Hey, medic, Get a medic over here!
- You need to hurry up, please,

1261
01:34:07,724 --> 01:34:09,434
Come, hurry, hurry,

1262
01:34:12,312 --> 01:34:14,772
- Let me help you,
- Someone give this guard a hand, please,

1263
01:34:17,734 --> 01:34:19,235
Oh, Tatiana, my darling,

1264
01:34:22,322 --> 01:34:24,490
- I was so worried about you,
- Move that truck out of the way!

1265
01:34:24,574 --> 01:34:25,575
Get him inside!

1266
01:34:26,368 --> 01:34:28,536
Tatiana, Tatiana,

1267
01:34:29,871 --> 01:34:32,373
You left me,
You left me,

1268
01:34:32,457 --> 01:34:34,542
Take this, I don't want it,
I don't want it,

1269
01:34:34,626 --> 01:34:37,420
You said you'd never leave me,
and you left me, You are a liar!

1270
01:34:39,673 --> 01:34:41,800
I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

1271
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:43,677
- I'm sorry,
- Papa, Papa,

1272
01:34:43,719 --> 01:34:46,638
- Papa, Mama!
- I love you,

1273
01:34:55,273 --> 01:34:58,025
I wanted you to be safe,
all of you,

1274
01:34:58,901 --> 01:35:01,570
That was not
your decision to make,

1275
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:05,074
We make our decisions together,
That was our promise,

1276
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:06,826
You're right,

1277
01:35:07,035 --> 01:35:08,953
You're right,

1278
01:35:09,037 --> 01:35:11,914
I knew that the minute
the truck pulled away,

1279
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:13,374
I'm sorry,

1280
01:35:13,708 --> 01:35:14,917
Come on, put some more water,

1281
01:35:15,001 --> 01:35:16,544
What are they doing?

1282
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:19,172
Dube,

1283
01:35:19,965 --> 01:35:23,635
I'm sorry, sir, They shut down
the water, This is all we have,

1284
01:35:30,184 --> 01:35:31,852
General,

1285
01:35:31,894 --> 01:35:33,395
Where are my supplies?

1286
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:36,106
I'm sorry, sir,
The cellar is empty,

1287
01:35:36,190 --> 01:35:41,236
You have nothing, and yet
you call me, begging me for help?

1288
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:43,655
Do you know the trouble I have
protecting these cockroaches?

1289
01:35:43,739 --> 01:35:46,033
Sir, I have money from the guests,

1290
01:35:46,075 --> 01:35:48,035
Rwandan francs!

1291
01:35:48,995 --> 01:35:51,163
Those are only good
for wiping your ass,

1292
01:35:52,749 --> 01:35:54,876
There is nothing more
I can do for you, Paul,

1293
01:35:54,918 --> 01:35:57,587
No more police,
no more protection,

1294
01:35:58,963 --> 01:36:01,840
Let the U,N, take care of you,

1295
01:36:04,761 --> 01:36:06,512
Drive, Go!

1296
01:36:13,103 --> 01:36:15,230
What would Sabena make of this?

1297
01:36:23,030 --> 01:36:24,114
Watch out!

1298
01:36:30,121 --> 01:36:31,622
Get down, get down!

1299
01:36:36,168 --> 01:36:38,420
Are you hurt?
Go outside,

1300
01:36:38,504 --> 01:36:41,048
Please stay still,
There's glass here, I will get it out,

1301
01:36:41,132 --> 01:36:42,842
Is anyone hurt, Odette?

1302
01:36:42,925 --> 01:36:45,052
Lots of cuts and bruises,

1303
01:36:51,518 --> 01:36:53,394
Thank God it was a storeroom,

1304
01:36:55,313 --> 01:36:58,274
And in Rwanda,
humanitarian agencies report

1305
01:36:58,316 --> 01:37:00,860
that a rapid advance
by the Tutsi rebel army

1306
01:37:00,944 --> 01:37:04,823
has sparked a mass evacuation
of Hutu refugees towards the congo.

1307
01:37:04,865 --> 01:37:07,033
One aid worker described it

1308
01:37:07,117 --> 01:37:10,120
as the largest refugee exodus
in modern history.

1309
01:37:10,204 --> 01:37:11,914
The rebels have taken half the city,

1310
01:37:11,997 --> 01:37:16,167
and they have proposed a deal
the Hutu generals are willing to accept,

1311
01:37:17,086 --> 01:37:20,130
The rebels will exchange
their Hutu prisoners,

1312
01:37:20,172 --> 01:37:22,007
and you people,
all of you,

1313
01:37:22,091 --> 01:37:25,469
will be able to move
behind the rebel lines where it's safe,

1314
01:37:25,511 --> 01:37:27,596
The lnterhamwe, what about them?

1315
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:31,016
- No one controls them,
- This time they will kill us all,

1316
01:37:31,058 --> 01:37:33,477
They will kill us all if we stay here,

1317
01:37:34,145 --> 01:37:35,855
We have to take the chance,

1318
01:37:36,814 --> 01:37:38,816
What time should we
be ready to leave?

1319
01:37:39,734 --> 01:37:41,819
I can put it together
in two days, Paul,

1320
01:37:41,903 --> 01:37:43,154
Two days?

1321
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:46,741
Colonel, there is no way that we
can hold out for two days,

1322
01:37:46,825 --> 01:37:48,618
I have nothing left
to bribe them with,

1323
01:37:50,162 --> 01:37:54,207
Colonel, we will

1324
01:38:17,857 --> 01:38:21,026
Diane,,,let your mother rest,

1325
01:38:21,068 --> 01:38:23,403
You rest too, sweetheart,

1326
01:38:32,247 --> 01:38:33,498
Diplomat,

1327
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:36,542
What?

1328
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,420
I have to go to the Diplomat,

1329
01:38:49,723 --> 01:38:52,600
- What are you doing?
- We have to go to the Diplomat,

1330
01:38:52,643 --> 01:38:55,187
- To do what?
- Your items, they are there,

1331
01:38:56,605 --> 01:38:59,107
Will you please put your
policemen at the gate, sir?

1332
01:38:59,191 --> 01:39:02,110
No, Let us see
what you have to offer first,

1333
01:39:13,539 --> 01:39:15,707
Oh, no, Madame Archer,

1334
01:39:33,560 --> 01:39:34,561
Move, move!

1335
01:39:39,983 --> 01:39:41,317
- Cover us,
- Yes, sir,

1336
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:42,402
Hurry!

1337
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:48,033
Come on, show me,

1338
01:39:57,251 --> 01:40:00,087
Look at this,
Nice, yes?

1339
01:40:00,838 --> 01:40:02,172
And here you are,

1340
01:40:09,013 --> 01:40:11,557
The rebels are
getting closer, yes?

1341
01:40:12,433 --> 01:40:14,977
The rebels can have this graveyard,

1342
01:40:15,019 --> 01:40:17,354
We have ordered everyone
out of the city,

1343
01:40:20,108 --> 01:40:21,275
Here,

1344
01:40:22,360 --> 01:40:23,611
Have a drink,

1345
01:40:30,369 --> 01:40:32,371
You know what
the Scottish call it?

1346
01:40:32,454 --> 01:40:33,955
No,

1347
01:40:35,791 --> 01:40:39,211
Uisge beatha--water of life,

1348
01:40:45,384 --> 01:40:51,348
I went once on a tour of the finest
single malt distillery in the world,

1349
01:40:52,224 --> 01:40:55,143
- Have you ever been to Scotland?
- No, sir,

1350
01:40:56,270 --> 01:40:57,771
Wonderful country,

1351
01:40:58,523 --> 01:41:00,107
Wonderful golf,

1352
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:04,445
I wonder, will I ever go back?

1353
01:41:06,072 --> 01:41:07,365
What do you think?

1354
01:41:08,742 --> 01:41:09,868
No,

1355
01:41:11,494 --> 01:41:14,497
I hope we all get to do
a great many things, General,

1356
01:41:15,999 --> 01:41:17,542
Can we go now,
please, sir?

1357
01:41:19,294 --> 01:41:21,963
I am going to do you
a great favor, Paul,

1358
01:41:22,089 --> 01:41:24,007
- Private,
- Yes, sir!

1359
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:27,260
Pack those carefully,
put them in my keep, and guard them,

1360
01:41:28,053 --> 01:41:32,557
I am going to take you with us
to our new headquarters in Gitarama,

1361
01:41:33,350 --> 01:41:35,435
I do not want to go
to Gitarama, sir,

1362
01:41:35,519 --> 01:41:38,188
Well, you can't go back
to the hotel,

1363
01:41:38,272 --> 01:41:40,065
The crazy men are
on their way there now,

1364
01:41:40,149 --> 01:41:45,571
Sir,,,General, we must go back
so that I can get my family,

1365
01:41:45,613 --> 01:41:48,741
Trust me,

1366
01:41:48,825 --> 01:41:53,705
General, these are difficult times,

1367
01:41:53,788 --> 01:41:55,581
We need to help one another,

1368
01:41:55,623 --> 01:41:58,959
And what help can I get
from you, Paul?

1369
01:41:59,043 --> 01:42:02,463
- You are a marked man, sir,

1370
01:42:02,547 --> 01:42:06,342
You are on a list, The Americans
have you on their list as a war criminal,

1371
01:42:06,426 --> 01:42:09,429
Paul, I am sick and tired

1372
01:42:09,471 --> 01:42:12,265
Are you stupid, General?

1373
01:42:12,307 --> 01:42:14,517
How do you think
these people operate?

1374
01:42:14,601 --> 01:42:19,063
You sit here with five stars on your chest,
Who do you think they are coming after?

1375
01:42:23,652 --> 01:42:24,819
Fine,

1376
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:30,158
We will go to Gitarama,
and you will stay on that list,

1377
01:42:30,242 --> 01:42:34,162
- I committed no war crimes,
- Who will tell them?

1378
01:42:34,205 --> 01:42:37,166
You need me to tell them
how you helped at the hotel,

1379
01:42:37,208 --> 01:42:40,461
They blame you for all their misfortunes,
They say you led the massacres,

1380
01:42:40,503 --> 01:42:42,004
I led no massacres!

1381
01:42:42,088 --> 01:42:44,006
Do you think they're
going to believe you?

1382
01:42:44,090 --> 01:42:45,633
You will tell them the truth!

1383
01:42:45,675 --> 01:42:47,885
I will tell them nothing
unless you help me,

1384
01:42:49,721 --> 01:42:52,181
What are you going to do,
shoot me?

1385
01:42:54,184 --> 01:42:55,518
Shoot me,

1386
01:42:56,186 --> 01:42:58,313
Please shoot me,
It would be a blessing,

1387
01:42:58,355 --> 01:43:01,691
I will pay you to shoot my family,

1388
01:43:02,692 --> 01:43:04,026
You cannot hurt me,

1389
01:43:04,111 --> 01:43:07,656
You will tell them
that I did nothing!

1390
01:43:10,409 --> 01:43:13,286
We are leaving,
Right now,

1391
01:43:22,129 --> 01:43:24,047
Get out!

1392
01:43:26,384 --> 01:43:28,469
Get these people
away from the gate!

1393
01:43:34,308 --> 01:43:36,310
Stop it! Stop it!

1394
01:43:37,061 --> 01:43:38,354
Clear the hotel,

1395
01:43:39,105 --> 01:43:41,273

01:43:46,196 --> 01:43:49,824
All of the militia
must leave now! Get out!

1399
01:44:11,388 --> 01:44:12,555
Oh, no, no!

1400
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:14,141
Shut up, cockroach!
Get down!

1401
01:44:16,644 --> 01:44:18,520
That's him, That's him!

Tatiana!

1407
01:45:06,070 --> 01:45:08,322
- Have you seen Tatiana?
- No, I've not seen Tatiana,

1408
01:45:08,406 --> 01:45:10,908
- Paul, what is happening?
- I have to find my wife!

1409
01:45:13,202 --> 01:45:14,328
Tatiana!

1410
01:45:18,333 --> 01:45:19,500
Tatiana!

1411
01:45:46,278 --> 01:45:48,029
They've gone, They've gone,

1412
01:45:50,366 --> 01:45:51,367
They've gone,

1413
01:45:56,288 --> 01:45:58,290
What were you
going to do with this?

01:47:04,734 --> 01:47:07,236
