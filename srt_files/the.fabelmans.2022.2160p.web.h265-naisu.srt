1
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,920
BURT: Mommy and Daddy
will be right next to you.

2
00:00:50,056 --> 00:00:51,490
The lights will go down.

3
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:54,125
There may be some organ music
as the curtain opens.

4
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,391
Don't be scared.

5
00:00:55,526 --> 00:00:57,327
It'll be dark in there,
you said.

6
00:00:57,462 --> 00:00:59,428
- I don't want to go in.
- But it's fun.

7
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:01,130
All week,
you've been so excited.

8
00:01:01,265 --> 00:01:02,829
Your first ever movie.

9
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:05,536
- And the people are gigantic.
- What people?

10
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:08,142
You said the people
in the movie are gigantic.

11
00:01:08,277 --> 00:01:09,909
Oh, because of
the big screen they're on,

12
00:01:10,044 --> 00:01:11,773
but they're not real, uh, right?

13
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:14,809
- MITZI: They're like dreams.
- Dreams are scary.

14
00:01:14,945 --> 00:01:18,318
Some dreams are, but this is
gonna be a nice dream.

15
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,778
About a circus and clowns
and acrobats and, um...

16
00:01:21,914 --> 00:01:23,289
You want to know how it works?

17
00:01:23,424 --> 00:01:25,322
There's a big machine
called a projector.

18
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:27,124
Inside, there's
a big bright light,

19
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,658
and it projects photographs

20
00:01:28,793 --> 00:01:30,833
- of-of clowns and acrobats.
- MITZI: And elephants.

21
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,299
- Uh, "projecting" means it sends them out.
- Happy things.

22
00:01:33,434 --> 00:01:35,599
Happy things like light
from a huge flashlight.

23
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:38,431
But these photographs move past
the light really fast.

24
00:01:38,567 --> 00:01:40,366
24 photos in every second.

25
00:01:40,502 --> 00:01:41,936
Now, in your brain,

26
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:44,573
each photograph stays
for about a 15th of a second.

27
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:47,110
That's called
persistence of vision.

28
00:01:47,246 --> 00:01:48,743
The photographs move past

29
00:01:48,878 --> 00:01:50,580
faster than your brain
can let go of them,

30
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,583
and that's how
the movie projector tricks us

31
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:55,953
into believing that
motionless pictures are moving.

32
00:01:56,088 --> 00:01:58,621
A motion picture.

33
00:01:58,756 --> 00:02:02,961
Movies are dreams, doll,
that you never forget.

34
00:02:03,096 --> 00:02:04,163
You just wait and see.

35
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,578
When it's over,
you're gonna have

36
00:02:05,697 --> 00:02:07,595
the biggest, sloppiest smile
on your face.

37
00:02:07,731 --> 00:02:09,597
They're letting us in.

38
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:25,916
HARRY:
Wait till the engines pass.

39
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:42,467
Unlock the door.

40
00:02:45,472 --> 00:02:47,003
KLAUS:
Pass it down.

41
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,112
- What's that?
- Second section.

42
00:02:54,315 --> 00:02:56,945
KLAUS:
Angel. She's on that train.

43
00:02:57,081 --> 00:02:59,281
HARRY: So what? We got the
dough. Let's get out of here.

44
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,420
Lights. I must turn the lights
down the track.

45
00:03:01,555 --> 00:03:03,255
You crazy lunkhead.
Give me that wheel.

46
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:06,022
We are going to...
Down the track!

47
00:03:08,228 --> 00:03:10,356
The train! Stop the train!

48
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:12,094
Stop the train!

49
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,130
Stop! Can't you see the lights?!

50
00:03:16,265 --> 00:03:17,535
Stop!

51
00:03:19,502 --> 00:03:20,967
First section! Hold it!

52
00:03:21,102 --> 00:03:24,773
KLAUS: Angel! Angel!

53
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,435
What was your favorite part?

54
00:03:53,474 --> 00:03:56,242
Sammy, what do you want
for Hanukkah?

55
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:58,608
I told you
this wasn't a good idea,

56
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,414
what with all of his
A-N-X-I-E-T-I-E-S.

57
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:03,546
Kids his age have big
I-M-A-G-I-N-A-T-I-O-N-S.

58
00:04:03,682 --> 00:04:07,585
No fair spelling out
the long words.

59
00:04:10,723 --> 00:04:12,243
The lights change
how everything looks.

60
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,622
It's hard to find our house.

61
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:16,158
Ours is the dark house
with no lights.

62
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:29,109
That's what I want for Hanukkah.

63
00:04:29,244 --> 00:04:31,039
- What?
- Christmas lights!

64
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:33,640
Sorry, dolly.

65
00:04:33,775 --> 00:04:36,016
Jews don't get Christmas lights.

66
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,878
Eight nights of candlelight.

67
00:04:38,014 --> 00:04:41,421
♪ Who could ask
for anything more? ♪

68
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:45,119
♪ Who could ask for
anything more? ♪

69
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:48,928
Can I sleep
with the oscilloscope?

70
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,609
HARRY: <i>Get going.
We got to burn rubber.</i>

71
00:05:04,745 --> 00:05:06,265
- KLAUS: <i>What's that?
- Second section.</i>

72
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:07,864
KLAUS:
<i>Angel. She's on that train.</i>

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
<i>The lights.</i>

74
00:05:09,111 --> 00:05:10,671
<i>I must turn the lights
down the track.</i>

75
00:05:10,695 --> 00:05:11,544
<i>Stop the train!</i>

76
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:12,781
<i>Stop the train!</i>

77
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,514
<i>Angel!</i>

78
00:05:16,818 --> 00:05:20,493
SAMMY:
Mommy! Mommy!

79
00:05:22,362 --> 00:05:24,187
I know what I want for Hanukkah!

80
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,265
I know what I want
for Hanukkah!

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,633
(all speaking Hebrew in unison)

82
00:05:37,913 --> 00:05:39,346
...Hanukkah!

83
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:42,949
NATALIE:
Thank you!

84
00:05:46,415 --> 00:05:47,847
Sammy.

85
00:05:47,983 --> 00:05:50,087
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa.

86
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:52,052
I'm so excited.

87
00:05:58,328 --> 00:06:01,866
ALL: ♪ Down by the station
early in the morning ♪

88
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,836
♪ See the little pufferbellies

♪ Off they go. ♪

97
00:06:30,295 --> 00:06:33,631
Okay, so the outside grounds,
the middle conducts the power,

98
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:36,003
and these two metal wheels
under the engine

99
00:06:36,138 --> 00:06:37,532
complete the circuit.

100
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:40,667
So, new, Mr. Engineer?

101
00:06:40,802 --> 00:06:43,310
RCA gave you a raise?

102
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:45,941
That is
one expensive trolley car.

103
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:47,810
It's not a trolley car.
It's a Lionel train.

104
00:06:47,946 --> 00:06:49,950
No raises for the computer guys
this year.

105
00:06:50,085 --> 00:06:51,110
Next year, maybe.

106
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:52,726
Your moonlighting son
is paying for it

107
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,713
by filling up my house
with broken TVs.

108
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:57,183
Repair work, that's how.

109
00:06:57,318 --> 00:07:00,322
Oy, careful he doesn't
electrocute himself.

110
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:02,592
(speaks Russian)

111
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:04,225
- TINA: Hold on.
- You're okay.

112
00:07:04,361 --> 00:07:06,790
You're not taking that fancy
train to Florida without me.

113
00:07:06,925 --> 00:07:08,463
Hey, look.

114
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:10,601
She's down on the floor.

115
00:07:10,737 --> 00:07:12,599
Who's gonna help her up?

116
00:07:12,735 --> 00:07:14,200
Who says I'm getting up?

117
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:17,977
I'm going to Miami
on the Sammy Limited.

118
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:19,975
Go ahead.

119
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,011
Ooh.

120
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:32,515
I precisely engineer toys.

121
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,017
You can play with them

122
00:08:34,152 --> 00:08:35,992
when you've learned
to treat them with respect.

123
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,691
I do respect them. I love them.

124
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:39,746
I know you do, but you can't
just love something.

125
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,430
You also have to
take care of it, right?

126
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:49,603
Maybe we can play together
with them this weekend.

127
00:08:57,677 --> 00:09:00,174
But I need to see them crash.

128
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,209
I don't understand.

129
00:09:05,246 --> 00:09:07,918
Why does he need
to see them crash?

130
00:09:12,094 --> 00:09:13,152
It's late.

131
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:14,687
You don't want
to shut your light?

132
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:15,855
Mm. In a minute.

133
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:18,497
I'm still wide-awake.

134
00:09:18,632 --> 00:09:20,993
You see these descending notes?

135
00:09:21,128 --> 00:09:23,598
That's called a lament bass.

136
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:29,170
You should play it on the radio
on that arts program.

137
00:09:29,305 --> 00:09:31,037
- Oh.
- They keep asking you to go back.

138
00:09:31,172 --> 00:09:32,840
I don't have time for that. Mm.

139
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,711
Well, we can hire a sitter.

140
00:09:34,846 --> 00:09:36,086
Who can afford that? Forget it.

141
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:38,218
That was another life.

142
00:09:38,353 --> 00:09:40,621
That was two kids ago.

143
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:49,025
You know what I miss most
about the piano?

144
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:54,030
Surrendering to the score.

145
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,504
Knowing Bach is
gonna tell you how...

146
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,940
First this note,
then this chord,

147
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:05,508
then you open your hand,
you stretch down an octave...

148
00:10:15,089 --> 00:10:19,121
Making a little world
you can be safe and happy in.

149
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,426
Thank you.

150
00:10:36,075 --> 00:10:39,713
That's why he needs
to watch them crash.

151
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:45,246
He's trying to get
some kind of control over it.

152
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:53,419
Sammy?

153
00:10:54,556 --> 00:10:57,958
We're going to use
Daddy's camera to film it.

154
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:00,194
Only crash the train once, okay?

155
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:01,833
Then, after we get
the film developed,

156
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,393
you can watch it crash
over and over

157
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:05,772
till it's not so scary anymore.

158
00:11:05,907 --> 00:11:08,467
And your real train
won't ever get broken.

159
00:11:10,643 --> 00:11:13,336
One more thing, dolly.

160
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,981
Let's not tell your father.

161
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:19,445
It'll be our secret movie,
just yours and mine.

162
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:23,449
- Okay?
- Okay.

163
00:11:24,424 --> 00:11:25,691
Sorry I'm late.

164
00:11:25,827 --> 00:11:27,726
I picked up
Ms. Moynahan's Motorola.

165
00:11:27,862 --> 00:11:29,302
There's no room left
in the workshop.

166
00:11:29,393 --> 00:11:31,433
- Where should I put it?
- The living room, I guess?

167
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,157
Okay.

168
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:35,994
Hey, uh, sorry I'm late.
I picked up Mrs. Fabelman.

169
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,270
Where should I put her?

170
00:11:39,201 --> 00:11:41,368
Ow! Ow, ow, ow.

171
00:11:41,503 --> 00:11:43,704
- Did the mail come?
- It's on the table.

172
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,847
Cossack.

173
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,933
- This is brisket?
- SAMMY: My movie!

174
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:11,633
MITZI:
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

175
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,368
After supper.

176
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:16,107
The amount of magnetism
is increased by

177
00:12:16,242 --> 00:12:18,373
how magnetically permeable
the core material is.

178
00:12:18,509 --> 00:12:20,814
The tricky thing is
how permeable we can make it.

179
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,278
Am I supposed to be
following any of this?

180
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:25,818
You know what
a magnetic field is, right?

181
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,888
Uh, yeah. Well, sure.
I mean, it...

182
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,085
Sammy, do you know
what a magnetic field is?

183
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,824
- Can I be excused?
- Nope.

184
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,694
But I need to,
just for a minute.

185
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,329
- What's so urgent?
- HADASSAH: Honey.

186
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,159
This tastes funny, Burt.

187
00:12:38,294 --> 00:12:40,425
It tastes funny
on a plastic fork.

188
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:43,493
- Ma.
- Is she saving the silverware

189
00:12:43,628 --> 00:12:45,739
for when the Eisenhowers
drop by?

190
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:47,434
The problem is
we're using vacuum tubes,

191
00:12:47,501 --> 00:12:49,206
not transistors,
and magnetic cores

192
00:12:49,341 --> 00:12:52,042
- to try to access memory...
- 35,000 magnetic cores.

193
00:12:52,178 --> 00:12:53,841
Hey, Sam, you know
on your father's camera

194
00:12:53,977 --> 00:12:55,110
when the film runs out?

195
00:12:55,245 --> 00:12:56,707
When that happens,
what do you do?

196
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,562
- Load more film.
- The same with computers.

197
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:00,624
You have to load more tape, and
that slows everything down...

198
00:13:00,648 --> 00:13:02,317
Mitz, the chopped liver
was beyond belief.

199
00:13:02,452 --> 00:13:04,155
BENNIE: ...load it with data,

200
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,320
and instead of changing tapes
every ten seconds,

201
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:08,023
this new machine
he's engineering...

202
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:10,486
- The BIZMAC!
- The BIZMAC!

203
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:12,499
It can search for information

204
00:13:12,631 --> 00:13:13,911
through all these tapes at once.

205
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:15,375
You never need
to change any of them.

206
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:16,551
It'll be ten times faster.

207
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:19,171
I love Burt's brain.

208
00:13:19,307 --> 00:13:22,374
Especially when you're around
to explain what's in it.

209
00:13:26,814 --> 00:13:28,054
Mom, I have to go upstairs now.

210
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,647
Not until
you've finished eating.

211
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:30,782
He cleaned his plate.

212
00:13:30,914 --> 00:13:32,241
No, he didn't.

00:13:33,281 --> 00:13:34,880
Sammy.

214
00:13:35,015 --> 00:13:36,933
Hey, Natalie, I think there's
something under your plate.

215
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:38,277
- MITZI: Sammy.
- No, there isn't.

216
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:39,161
BENNIE:
Lift it up and check.

217
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,487
I saw it moving.

218
00:13:49,371 --> 00:13:50,531
Licorice.

219
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,833
If there's anything
I'm a sucker for,

220
00:13:52,969 --> 00:13:53,969
it's licorice.

221
00:13:56,175 --> 00:13:58,977
Uncle Bennie,
that was so disgusting!

222
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:01,977
- No, no!
- Natalie, he is not your uncle.

223
00:14:02,112 --> 00:14:04,478
Also, he is not that funny.

224
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:07,619
Oh, "uncle" is a term
of affection.

225
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,221
Natalie, he's not related.

226
00:14:10,357 --> 00:14:15,127
He's only always here
because he works for my son.

227
00:14:15,263 --> 00:14:18,029
He's only always here because
he's my best friend.

00:22:17,101 --> 00:22:19,205
OLDER SAMMY:
Stop.

351
00:22:19,341 --> 00:22:20,941
Freeze.

352
00:22:29,488 --> 00:22:30,749
- Where's the lunch box?
- Wow.

353
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:32,315
Where's the lunch box?! Hurry!

354
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,970
Guys, look at the monster
Sammy caught.

355
00:22:34,094 --> 00:22:35,658
I got the babies.

356
00:22:35,793 --> 00:22:37,658
- ROGER: Sal found babies.
- Look at that.

357
00:22:37,793 --> 00:22:38,873
ROGER:
Sammy, Dean, come on.

358
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,464
There's a huge nest right there.

359
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,365
- Come on, guys.
- A big one, Sammy.

360
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:44,226
- SAMMY: Oh, God.
- BOYS: Oh!

361
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:45,567
DEAN:
It's a whole herd of 'em.

362
00:22:45,702 --> 00:22:46,833
SAL:
Scorpions come in nests.

363
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:48,508
No, actually,
it's a bed of scorpions.

364
00:22:48,643 --> 00:22:50,805
No, it's a nest.

365
00:22:50,941 --> 00:22:53,001
The baby scorpions
are called "scorplings."

366
00:22:53,137 --> 00:22:54,236
They're twice as venomous.

367
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,557
That's-that's why
the lab pays more.

368
00:22:55,581 --> 00:22:57,012
There's got to be
like 50 of 'em.

369
00:22:57,147 --> 00:22:58,325
Well, how much is the
laboratory gonna pay for them?

370
00:22:58,349 --> 00:22:59,650
50 cents per baby.

371
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:02,088
- That's 25 bucks!
- We're rich.

372
00:23:02,223 --> 00:23:04,417
Well, what are we gonna buy?

373
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,522
12 dollars even.

374
00:23:09,292 --> 00:23:12,225
Well, it's the merit badge
for photography, not movies.

375
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:14,730
The manual says you got to tell
a story with still pictures.

376
00:23:14,866 --> 00:23:16,602
Yeah, but all a movie is
is still pictures.

377
00:23:16,737 --> 00:23:18,777
You just put a bunch of them
together and they move.

378
00:23:18,801 --> 00:23:20,967
Okay, but what kind of movie
are we making?

379
00:23:21,103 --> 00:23:23,602
Ooh. Sammy, look.
It's Janet Benedict.

380
00:23:26,977 --> 00:23:28,875
Hey, go on and talk to her.
I dare you.

381
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:30,316
HARK:
He already talked to her.

382
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,911
- SAL: No way.
- DEAN: Like hell.

383
00:23:32,046 --> 00:23:33,848
No way.
He actually spoke to her?

384
00:23:33,984 --> 00:23:36,015
He did. He did.
He walked right up to her.

385
00:23:36,151 --> 00:23:37,600
- And he...
- You went up to Janet Benedict?

386
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,064
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

387
00:23:39,135 --> 00:23:40,855
Oh, come on.
Tell them what happened, Sammy.

388
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:41,879
Nothing happened.

389
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:44,363
Something happened. Come on.

390
00:23:44,499 --> 00:23:46,862
Could be the same one.

391
00:23:48,064 --> 00:23:50,932
"Overland." Say, I think
it is the same one.

392
00:23:51,698 --> 00:23:53,473
Well, I declare.

393
00:23:57,244 --> 00:23:58,578
So, uh,

394
00:23:58,713 --> 00:24:01,747
Sammy kind of side winds his way
in her direction.

395
00:24:01,882 --> 00:24:03,979
And he's trying to, um...
he-he's trying to work up

396
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:06,583
the nerve to say something
slick and smooth like,

397
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:08,486
- "Hey, Jan, baby."
- No, I wasn't.

398
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:10,085
You're making this up.

399
00:24:10,221 --> 00:24:12,488
But-but he sees that Janet's
got something on her nose.

400
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:13,790
So now he's thinking, "Cool.

401
00:24:13,926 --> 00:24:15,606
Here's my excuse to go up
and talk to her."

402
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:18,830
So he goes and he says, "Hey,
uh, sorry, Janet.

403
00:24:18,966 --> 00:24:21,166
It-it looks like you have
a little smudge on your nose."

404
00:24:21,261 --> 00:24:22,964
- Shut up, Hark.
- But it wasn't a smudge.

405
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,060
- It looked like a smudge.
- And it wasn't little.

406
00:24:25,084 --> 00:24:26,660
Hark, shut up!

407
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:29,370
It was a booger!

408
00:24:29,505 --> 00:24:30,838
A big, fat,

409
00:24:30,974 --> 00:24:32,844
Janet Benedict booger.

410
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:37,847
It was huge.

411
00:24:42,654 --> 00:24:43,719
Hey, Sammy.

412
00:24:43,854 --> 00:24:45,524
Stand and deliver.

413
00:24:45,659 --> 00:24:48,253
What kind of movie
are we gonna make?

414
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:52,196
HARK:
Stand and deliver.

415
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:55,770
SAMMY: No, keep screaming.
Keep screaming.

416
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,330
I need more dust. Dad, can you
grab the sandwich board?

417
00:25:01,354 --> 00:25:03,670
REGGIE: No, no. God, no,
no more dust. No.

418
00:25:03,805 --> 00:25:05,205
Reggie, stop coughing!

419
00:25:05,341 --> 00:25:07,188
- REGGIE: I'm coughing because there's dust.
- Okay.

420
00:25:07,212 --> 00:25:08,925
- More dust, fellas.
- Natalie, say, "Please don't kill me."

421
00:25:08,949 --> 00:25:09,808
- NATALIE: All right.
- SAMMY: Reggie, stop coughing.

422
00:25:09,943 --> 00:25:11,410
You're being dramatic.

423
00:25:11,546 --> 00:25:13,059
Mr. Fabelman, you're getting
dirt inside my stagecoach.

424
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:14,743
REGGIE: Don't you want me
to be dramatic?

425
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,159
- Don't look into the camera.
- Well, we'll clean it out.

426
00:25:16,183 --> 00:25:17,556
Guys, stop looking
into the camera.

427
00:25:17,691 --> 00:25:19,288
- I can't use any of this.
- -Dad!

428
00:26:10,737 --> 00:26:12,139
Fake.

429
00:26:14,182 --> 00:26:15,579
Totally fake.

430
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,161
You hear it?

431
00:27:07,297 --> 00:27:09,095
She has got to cut
those goddamn fingernails

432
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:10,868
before she goes
on live television.

433
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,472
I have to perform this
tomorrow.

434
00:27:13,608 --> 00:27:15,440
It's a difficult piece.

435
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:17,139
It's a very big deal for me.

436
00:27:17,274 --> 00:27:19,578
All I asked was for you
to keep your big traps shut

437
00:27:19,714 --> 00:27:22,381
and listen
to my dress rehearsal.

438
00:27:22,516 --> 00:27:23,813
Sorry, Mitz. It's wonderful.

439
00:27:23,949 --> 00:27:25,229
You hear how
the rising arpeggios

440
00:27:25,347 --> 00:27:26,952
lift up the sad notes?

441
00:27:27,088 --> 00:27:29,448
It's in F minor, but your mom
makes it sound so alive.

442
00:27:29,583 --> 00:27:31,583
She makes it sound like
she's playing a typewriter.

443
00:27:32,622 --> 00:27:34,357
Oh, no.

444
00:27:34,492 --> 00:27:35,691
Not this again.

445
00:27:41,096 --> 00:27:42,733
Do you hear it? Am I clicking?

446
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,996
I concentrate
on your playing, but...

447
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,605
Bu... Oh, great. But what?

448
00:27:46,741 --> 00:27:48,021
But people can hear it
in Tucson.

449
00:27:48,139 --> 00:27:48,900
Maybe I've gotten used to it.

450
00:27:49,036 --> 00:27:50,036
Maybe GE should make

451
00:27:50,071 --> 00:27:51,191
rubber tips for fingernails.

452
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:53,608
All right, Mitzi Fabelman.

453
00:27:53,744 --> 00:27:55,206
Time to face the music.

454
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,914
BURT: Oh, boy.

455
00:27:57,049 --> 00:27:58,684
You stay away from me
with those things.

456
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,380
- It's Beethoven, damn it.
- No, no, no!

457
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:02,029
- It is not Morse code. Come on.
- No! Stop! Stop! Stop it!

458
00:28:02,053 --> 00:28:03,573
He has a point, though,
especially with

459
00:28:03,597 --> 00:28:05,088
the polydirectional
ribbon microphones

460
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:06,623
they have on television
stage...

461
00:28:08,961 --> 00:28:10,393
...Come on. You married her.

462
00:28:10,528 --> 00:28:11,762
Dad, don't.

463
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,218
Do it. Do it.
Do it. Do it. Do it!

464
00:28:13,263 --> 00:28:14,897
I will scratch you.
Don't think I won't!

465
00:28:15,033 --> 00:28:16,569
BENNIE:
Do you think Arthur Rubinstein

466
00:28:16,704 --> 00:28:18,001
had fingernails?

467
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:19,936
- Horowitz? Schnabel?
- Do not think about it.

468
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,048
- Kempff?
- No, no, no.

469
00:28:21,104 --> 00:28:22,707
- MEN: Liberace.
- No, no, no, no.

470
00:28:22,842 --> 00:28:23,983
- Not my nails.
- Come on, Fabelman.

471
00:28:24,007 --> 00:28:25,287
Show her
who's General Electric's

472
00:28:25,374 --> 00:28:27,374
- product design manager.
- No, my beautiful nails.

473
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:29,494
I paid a buck 50
at the beauty parlor for these.

474
00:28:29,549 --> 00:28:31,342
Oh, no.

475
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:35,953
MEN: One, two, three.

476
00:28:38,756 --> 00:28:40,791
Get off of me, Delilah.

477
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,360
- Delilah?
- Okay, the fun's over.

478
00:28:42,496 --> 00:28:44,592
I'll do the rest myself.

479
00:28:49,998 --> 00:28:52,435
Oh.

480
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:53,771
Oh, great.

481
00:28:53,907 --> 00:28:56,106
Just great.
Well, that decides it.

482
00:28:56,241 --> 00:28:58,539
I'm gonna play the program
from memory tomorrow.

483
00:28:58,674 --> 00:29:03,248
No sheet music, short nails,
like a real performing artist.

484
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:53,531
Did you drop your gun?

485
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:54,667
Come on.

486
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,477
That's me.

487
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,951
ROGER:
Real scary, Sheriff.

488
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,424
BOY: Whoa.

489
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,171
BOY: Whoa.

490
00:30:42,814 --> 00:30:45,012
H-How'd you do that?

491
00:30:47,818 --> 00:30:49,449
How'd you do that?

492
00:31:07,806 --> 00:31:09,708
Whoa!

493
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,548
BOY:
Go, Sammy!

494
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,791
It's kind of like what I do,
isn't it,

495
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:30,023
what a movie director does?

496
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,357
- It is?
- I figure out

497
00:31:31,493 --> 00:31:33,164
what my division
needs to accomplish,

498
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:36,562
then I work out how my guys
are gonna get it done.

499
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,534
Yeah, it is. Yeah, sort of.

500
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:42,403
How'd you make it look like
the guns were really firing?

501
00:31:44,711 --> 00:31:46,344
I did it with pins.

502
00:31:46,479 --> 00:31:47,639
Pins.

503
00:31:47,774 --> 00:31:50,011
Yeah, I poked holes
in the film with pins.

504
00:31:50,147 --> 00:31:51,715
- Sammy.
- Yeah.

505
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:53,280
Thinking like an engineer.

506
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:55,180
Watch the road, Dad.

507
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:58,617
Sammy, watch the road.

508
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,312
I can't edit
without an editing machine.

509
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,521
I have to be able
to cut and splice, and I...

510
00:32:02,656 --> 00:32:05,128
Let's revisit it
after the camping trip.

511
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:07,396
It's three hours
to the national forest.

512
00:32:07,532 --> 00:32:10,599
If you get your license,
you can help with the driving.

513
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,103
Okay.

514
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:15,634
"You are approaching
a railroad crossing

515
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,873
"with no warning devices
and limited visibility.

516
00:32:18,008 --> 00:32:19,342
The speed limit is..."

517
00:32:19,477 --> 00:32:21,277
See, the thing is, though,
about my new movie,

518
00:32:21,301 --> 00:32:22,815
is that it's just...

519
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,379
It's about World War II,
your war.

520
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:27,035
It's gonna be, like,
out of this world.

521
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:28,150
I'm shooting on a Bolex H8.

522
00:32:28,285 --> 00:32:29,645
Finally, I can use
double run film.

523
00:32:29,746 --> 00:32:30,866
You know, that's six minutes

524
00:32:30,948 --> 00:32:32,268
without having to
change the reel.

525
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:34,491
How much did you spend
to rent this camera?

526
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:37,192
20 bucks. But I used my own money.

527
00:32:37,328 --> 00:32:38,523
You don't have to...

528
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,758
And this movie editor
gizmo costs?

529
00:32:40,893 --> 00:32:43,292
It's a Mansfield
eight millimeter movie editor.

530
00:32:43,427 --> 00:32:45,464
How much?

531
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,739
- 80 bucks.
- Doggone it, Sammy!

532
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:50,070
A hundred dollars for a hobby?

533
00:32:50,205 --> 00:32:51,672
It's not a hobby, Dad.

534
00:32:51,808 --> 00:32:53,968
If you spent half the time
on algebra that you spend on

535
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:56,424
- these movies, you could get...
- Algebra? I hate algebra.

536
00:32:56,448 --> 00:32:57,368
Why are you...

537
00:32:57,446 --> 00:32:58,909
It's completely pointless.

538
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:01,165
Not if you want to make
something, it's not pointless.

539
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:03,682
Gee, Sammy, when I was a boy,
I always used to think,

540
00:33:03,818 --> 00:33:06,020
- "Somebody figured out how to make this."
- Yeah.

541
00:33:06,156 --> 00:33:07,389
- This car...
- Uh-huh.

542
00:33:07,524 --> 00:33:09,794
...that rearview mirror,
that directional signal.

543
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,861
I want to make movies, though.

544
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:14,796
I mean something real.

545
00:33:14,932 --> 00:33:17,267
Not imaginary.

546
00:33:19,106 --> 00:33:21,700
Something someone can
actually use.

547
00:33:23,106 --> 00:33:25,938
Like a driver's license.

548
00:33:26,841 --> 00:33:29,144
LISA: I'm gonna vomit, Sammy!
I'm gonna vomit!

549
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,519
REGGIE:
Sammy, please pull over.

550
00:33:30,544 --> 00:33:31,976
She's gonna puke all over me.

551
00:33:32,112 --> 00:33:34,445
- -Go slower.
- You are the worst driver.

552
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,144
You're gonna break the car.

553
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:38,551
We're on a back road going
three miles per hour.

554
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:40,757
- Calm down.
- You're doing great, doll.

555
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:41,893
You're doing very well.

556
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:43,656
Okay, watch out.
Puddle up ahead.

557
00:33:51,769 --> 00:33:53,536
BURT: So we've got three

558
00:33:53,672 --> 00:33:55,548
that are strong and still green
inside, so they don't burn.

559
00:33:55,572 --> 00:33:57,501
Bright green means
that they're still alive

560
00:33:57,637 --> 00:33:59,475
and that they carry moisture.

561
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:02,708
And the reason that we use
the shape of the triangle

562
00:34:02,843 --> 00:34:05,282
is that when
these three points connect,

563
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:07,986
if we find the center
of gravitational force,

564
00:34:08,121 --> 00:34:10,288
it creates
almost perfect balance.

565
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:12,343
- Whew. Oh.
- Because I'm Tutti, and you're Frutti.

566
00:34:12,390 --> 00:34:14,589
So who else

is not for
industrial process control,

610
00:36:27,107 --> 00:36:28,747
and it will raise
every red flag there is.

00:36:28,875 --> 00:36:30,594
- How many bits?
- Float64.

612
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,962
64 bits?

613
00:36:32,097 --> 00:36:33,230
Sixty... You are nuts.

614
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:35,432
And time-sharing

615
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:37,328
They're gonna know
this is a business machine

616
00:36:37,352 --> 00:36:39,794
we're building, and we're
all gonna get fired.

617
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,231
No.

618
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,537
Yes!

619
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:44,140
GE doesn't build
business computers.

620
00:36:44,275 --> 00:36:45,555
We do heavy industry processing.

621
00:36:45,609 --> 00:36:46,969
You got that
straight from the CEO.

622
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,612
Ralph Cordiner is gonna
skin you alive.

623
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:51,547
Once Bank of America buys in,
this will be profitable,

624
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:54,149
and that's Mr. Cordiner's job,
making money.

625
00:36:54,285 --> 00:36:55,484
My job is getting Raytheon

626
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,123
to deliver
10,000 germanium transistors

627
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,578
that meet
our tolerance standards.

628
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:01,786
And your job is to get
the cabling diagrams

629
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:03,659
to Pitney Bowes
so when the time comes,

630
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:05,856
we have a sorter to hook up
to the mainframe.

631
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,432
Well, maybe Pitney Bowes
will hire me

632
00:37:07,532 --> 00:37:08,606
after you get us both
canned from GE.

633
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,127
Isn't it worth getting canned

634
00:37:10,262 --> 00:37:12,663
for the chance to build
a machine that can do all that?

635
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:14,262
It's worth it to you, maybe!

636
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:16,037
Sure as the Lord made
little green apples,

637
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:17,104
California, here you come.

638
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:18,473
IBM is waiting.

639
00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:20,009
REGGIE:
Are we moving to California?

640
00:37:20,107 --> 00:37:22,107
- BENNIE: You are, any day now.
- BURT: No, no, no.

641
00:37:22,131 --> 00:37:23,051
SAMMY:
What?

642
00:37:23,078 --> 00:37:24,658
BURT: IBM's asking,
and that's flattering, but...

643
00:37:24,682 --> 00:37:26,044
- BENNIE: Flattering?
- Flattering!

644
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:28,059
Every guy in computer
would give his matzo balls

645
00:37:28,184 --> 00:37:29,480
to get an offer.

646
00:37:29,616 --> 00:37:31,050
You'll be in California

647
00:37:31,186 --> 00:37:33,688
building double-precision
auxiliary units with an FP64.

648
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:36,021
I'm gonna be left
schvitzing in Arizona

649
00:37:36,156 --> 00:37:38,076
- making 40-watt light bulbs.
- Hold your horses.

650
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,603
- Congruence? Come on.
- I told your mom it'll be up to her.

651
00:37:40,666 --> 00:37:43,260
I'm not uprooting us again
unless she says yes.

652
00:37:43,396 --> 00:37:48,937
Why would Mamaleh ever leave
all of this for California?

653
00:37:49,707 --> 00:37:52,102
We have the Grand Canyon.

654
00:37:52,238 --> 00:37:55,314
They have the
San Andreas Fault.

655
00:37:56,382 --> 00:37:57,983
Mamaleh says...

656
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:00,711
I will never leave Arizona,

657
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:03,183
and Arizona will never leave me.

658
00:38:06,723 --> 00:38:09,526
Kids, avert your eyes.

659
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,174
- Hey, man.
- SAMMY: Hmm?

660
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:33,651
- Shouldn't you be filming this?
- Not enough light.

661
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,759
GE, living better electrically!

662
00:39:03,982 --> 00:39:05,176
Mom?

663
00:39:05,311 --> 00:39:08,387
Mom, everyone can see
through your dress. Um...

664
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:14,085
Reggie, get out of the way.

665
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:17,462
Dad, can you please stop this?

666
00:39:18,264 --> 00:39:20,465
- Come. Sit.
- No.

667
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:26,161
Bennie, don't look!

668
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,704
Oh! You're all nuts!

669
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:28,797
My mama's such a good mama.

670
00:40:35,604 --> 00:40:37,773
I love you so much.

671
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:45,715
I'm right here.

672
00:40:47,253 --> 00:40:49,450
I'm right here with you.

673
00:40:49,585 --> 00:40:51,550
I'm holding your hand.

674
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,388
Can you feel that, Mama?

675
00:40:53,524 --> 00:40:55,091
I just gave you a squeeze.

676
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,589
I love you, Mama.

677
00:41:02,562 --> 00:41:04,030
Ma.

678
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:07,066
Mommy?

679
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,238
She opened her eyes.

680
00:41:11,373 --> 00:41:13,478
Nurse.

681
00:41:13,614 --> 00:41:16,037
Mommy, I'm here.
Here. I'm right here.

682
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:18,275
I'm right here, Mama.

683
00:41:19,284 --> 00:41:21,118
Mommy, look at me.

684
00:41:21,254 --> 00:41:23,280
Mommy, can you hear?

685
00:41:26,424 --> 00:41:27,720
Oh.

686
00:41:27,855 --> 00:41:31,794
Oh, oh...

687
00:42:00,091 --> 00:42:02,656
BURT: It's a Mansfield
eight millimeter movie editor.

688
00:42:02,792 --> 00:42:05,025
That's what you wanted, right?

689
00:42:09,762 --> 00:42:11,433
Oh, my God.

690
00:42:19,613 --> 00:42:21,474
Uh, now I need a favor
in return.

691
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,915
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

692
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:31,417
Here's the favor.

693
00:42:31,552 --> 00:42:33,284
Yeah.

694
00:42:38,996 --> 00:42:41,198
I want you to make
a camping trip movie.

695
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:42,690
Uh, you can learn

696
00:42:42,825 --> 00:42:44,039
how the editing machine works
while you do this.

697
00:42:44,063 --> 00:42:45,398
It'll make your mom feel better.

698
00:42:45,533 --> 00:42:47,068
Yeah.

699
00:42:47,203 --> 00:42:51,075
That last night when she danced
in the headlights,

700
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:53,409
that'd be great.

701
00:42:53,545 --> 00:42:55,779
Get to it tomorrow, okay?

702
00:42:57,749 --> 00:43:01,785
Um, tomorrow's
when we start shooting.

703
00:43:04,051 --> 00:43:05,455
<i>Escape to Nowhere.</i>

704
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:06,870
We're shooting all weekend, Dad.

705
00:43:06,894 --> 00:43:08,829
- I can't.
- Shoot it next weekend.

706
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:14,526
We've got like 40 guys
coming to be in the movie.

707
00:43:14,661 --> 00:43:17,164
I'll-I'll w-work on all the
camping trip stuff on Monday.

708
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:19,937
I'm asking you to do this now
for your mom. She's...

709
00:43:20,073 --> 00:43:22,839
Yeah, and I said that I will,
just not tomorrow, please.

710
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,907
Don't be selfish.
She just lost her mother.

711
00:43:26,043 --> 00:43:28,074
That's more important
than your hobby.

712
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:29,679
Dad, can you stop
calling it a hobby?

713
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:31,915
It'll cheer her up,
watching this.

714
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:34,130
- It's something we can do to...
- Her mom just died.

715
00:43:34,154 --> 00:43:35,885
How is that gonna cheer her up?

716
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,690
Because you made it for her.

717
00:43:49,095 --> 00:43:52,033
Uh, something's not right.

718
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:57,236
I don't know what else to do.

719
00:44:00,345 --> 00:44:02,373
Can you help me?

720
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:22,259
MITZI:
Hello.

721
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:25,598
TINA:
Mitzi. Mitzi.

722
00:44:29,571 --> 00:44:31,275
Mama?

723
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,343
Somebody's coming.

724
00:44:33,479 --> 00:44:35,208
MITZI:
Mama?

725
00:44:38,011 --> 00:44:40,644
M-Mama. What...

726
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:43,855
- Mama. Mam...
- You mustn't let him in.

727
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:48,192
- You mustn't let him in.
- Mama, I-I can't hear you.

728
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:49,792
I am scared.

729
00:44:49,928 --> 00:44:52,791
You mustn't let him
in the house.

730
00:44:52,926 --> 00:44:54,188
Mama, please. I...

731
00:44:54,323 --> 00:44:55,592
Do not let him in.

732
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:57,808
- Do not let him in the house.
- What? No, I can't...

733
00:44:57,867 --> 00:44:59,501
Wh-Who's coming?

734
00:44:59,637 --> 00:45:01,105
Don't open the door.

735
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,939
Mama.

736
00:45:05,234 --> 00:45:06,375
Mommy, don't go.

737
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,345
Don't go yet.

738
00:45:11,379 --> 00:45:14,478
You're having
a bad dream...

739
00:45:32,898 --> 00:45:36,207
...This is a lot of food, Mom.

740
00:45:36,342 --> 00:45:38,740
Well, I'm upset.

741
00:45:38,876 --> 00:45:40,973
Oh, my God. That crazy dream.

742
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:43,145
I can't get it out of my head.

743
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,981
Uh, last night, I dreamed
I got a call from my mama.

744
00:45:47,116 --> 00:45:49,184
And she wanted to warn me.

745
00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:51,919
- That's silly. Grandma died.
- REGGIE: About what?

746
00:45:52,055 --> 00:45:53,295
MITZI:
Well, something's coming.

747
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:55,223
She wants me
to batten down the hatches.

748
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:57,625
We're never going to be able
to eat all of this.

749
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:04,231
Who is that?

750
00:46:15,778 --> 00:46:17,480
It's Uncle Boris.

751
00:46:17,615 --> 00:46:18,480
SAMMY:
Hmm?

752
00:46:18,615 --> 00:46:20,280
Uncle who?

753
00:46:21,485 --> 00:46:23,151
Mom?

754
00:46:25,219 --> 00:46:27,892
That's who she meant!

755
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:32,457
My...
That's my-my mama's brother!

756
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:42,335
Oh, he scared the crap
out of her when they were kids!

757
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:53,247
Don't let him in!

758
00:46:56,754 --> 00:46:58,052
You were in the circus?

759
00:46:58,187 --> 00:46:59,788
Mama said you were
the lion tamer.

760
00:46:59,923 --> 00:47:01,355
BORIS:
No, not at first.

761
00:47:01,490 --> 00:47:05,359
At first, it was, "Podgorny,
pound in the tent pegs.

762
00:47:05,495 --> 00:47:08,359
Podgorny, muck out the
pachyderms."

763
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,935
And then, one night,
the big cat act,

764
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:14,432
he comes down with the flu bug,
so it was, uh,

765
00:47:14,567 --> 00:47:16,874
"Boris Podgorny,
in with the lions."

766
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,571
He's lying, right?

767
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:21,736
- No, he's telling you a story.
- Know what it's like, huh?

768
00:47:21,871 --> 00:47:23,809
Pain in the ass, sisters.

769
00:47:25,213 --> 00:47:26,582
- That's rude.
- He said "ass"!

770
00:47:26,717 --> 00:47:28,018
I know.

771
00:47:28,154 --> 00:47:31,321
But when did you start
working in the movies?

772
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:33,251
1927.

773
00:47:33,386 --> 00:47:34,858
1927... that was<i> The Jazz Singer.</i>

774
00:47:34,994 --> 00:47:36,434
That's the year
that talkies started.

775
00:47:36,458 --> 00:47:37,929
Yeah, sure, talkies. But me, no.

776
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:40,463
I started with, um,
<i>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>

777
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:42,093
Not a talkie.

778
00:47:42,228 --> 00:47:44,602
It was Harry Pollard.

779
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:46,232
He acted for Selig Polyscope.

780
00:47:46,368 --> 00:47:49,136
He, uh, married
Maggie what's-her-name.

781
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:51,101
- Mm-hmm.
- He directed<i> Uncle Tom.</i>

782
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:52,669
Lift up your plate.

783
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:56,146
So, Pollard needed help
with the bloodhounds.

784
00:47:56,281 --> 00:47:59,675
So, my pal Fleischaker was
a big name in dog acts.

785
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,117
Poodles, mainly.

786
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:04,319
But, "Sure,"
Fleischaker says to Pollard.

787
00:48:04,454 --> 00:48:07,018
"Yeah. Bloodhounds, poodles,
what's the difference?"

788
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:08,492
LISA:
Ooh.

789
00:48:08,628 --> 00:48:10,190
So, he went.

790
00:48:10,326 --> 00:48:14,130
But, uh, by this time,
uh, Fleischaker,

791
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,363
he had it up to here
with the Jew-haters.

792
00:48:16,498 --> 00:48:19,936
There was a lot of that kind
in the circuses.

793
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,903
Not many Jews,
lots of Jew-haters.

794
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:23,738
- Right.
- But the movies...

795
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:26,143
Oy vavoy!

796
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:28,107
Fleischaker writes to me,
"Boris," he writes.

797
00:48:28,243 --> 00:48:30,340
"Boris," he writes,

798
00:48:30,475 --> 00:48:32,745
"Hollywood is heimish, heimishe.

799
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,413
I'm in a minyan with Douglas
Fairbanks and Ricardo Cortez."

800
00:48:36,548 --> 00:48:37,708
- Whoa.
- "Come to Hollywood."

801
00:48:37,756 --> 00:48:38,983
So, I went.

802
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:44,054
Your wife, she don't like
doing the dishes?

803
00:48:44,189 --> 00:48:46,892
Uh, piano hands.

804
00:48:47,028 --> 00:48:49,366
Ah, fershteyn.

805
00:48:50,169 --> 00:48:54,369
So, you like the movies,
huh, Mr. Pitselshas?

806
00:48:54,505 --> 00:48:57,373
Okay, so the sergeant,
he comes over the hill here,

807
00:48:57,509 --> 00:49:01,109
and I'm gonna go below him,
so we see him and the sky.

808
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:02,779
And so we don't see
what he sees,

809
00:49:02,914 --> 00:49:04,412
but we do see that he's really...

810
00:49:04,548 --> 00:49:06,548
Okay, so he's, like,
almost losing his mind, right?

811
00:49:06,684 --> 00:49:08,844
- Mm-hmm.
- 'Cause what he is seeing is totally terrible.

812
00:49:08,884 --> 00:49:11,383
And then, I'm gonna turn
the camera so that we see it.

813
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,023
It's just in another notebook.
Hang on.

814
00:49:14,158 --> 00:49:16,193
If that's the movie, uh

815
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,588
you could show me instead of
describing me to death.

816
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:20,827
No, that's just
our stupid camping trip.

817
00:49:20,962 --> 00:49:22,330
My dad's...

818
00:49:22,466 --> 00:49:24,228
He wants me to put
this camping film together

819
00:49:24,363 --> 00:49:25,395
so it'll cheer up Mom.

820
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:28,705
Because her heart is broken.

821
00:49:28,841 --> 00:49:30,805
Because her mama iz toyt.

822
00:49:31,607 --> 00:49:34,172
But you, Mr. Director,
you don't want to do this,

823
00:49:34,308 --> 00:49:35,574
what your daddy tells you,

824
00:49:35,709 --> 00:49:37,947
because you want to make
your war picture, huh?

825
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:40,080
Yeah, yeah.

826
00:49:40,215 --> 00:49:42,213
Believe me, Sammy boy, I get it.

827
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:44,721
Family, art.

828
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:47,323
It'll tear you in two.

829
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,889
You hear that?

830
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:54,625
Oh, yeah. My mom's practicing.
She's always...

831
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:56,917
Sha. You talk too much. Listen.

832
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,835
When she was a kid,
already she played like that.

833
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:10,979
She should have been
a concert piano player.

834
00:50:11,114 --> 00:50:14,052
Little Rubinstein, she was.

835
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:16,747
She could have played...

836
00:50:16,882 --> 00:50:20,458
You name it,
she could have played there.

837
00:50:20,593 --> 00:50:22,220
And she...

838
00:50:23,023 --> 00:50:26,495
Once, I visited her and Tina
and Menashe in Cincinnati,

839
00:50:26,631 --> 00:50:30,800
and she says to me she wants
to be a great piano artist.

840
00:50:30,935 --> 00:50:32,567
But she didn't do it.

841
00:50:32,702 --> 00:50:35,471
Yeah, she's really good.
You know, she played on TV.

842
00:50:35,607 --> 00:50:36,867
TV? Feh!

843
00:50:37,002 --> 00:50:40,474
She could have played
at Musikverein in Vienna.

844
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,847
You see,
what she got in her heart

845
00:50:43,982 --> 00:50:45,613
is what you got, what I got.

846
00:50:45,749 --> 00:50:46,810
Art.

847
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:51,153
Like me. Like you, I think.

848
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:54,855
We're junkies,
and art is our drug.

849
00:50:54,990 --> 00:50:56,421
Family, we love.

850
00:50:56,556 --> 00:50:59,826
But art, we're meshuga for art.

851
00:50:59,962 --> 00:51:02,530
You think I wanted to leave my
sisters, my mama and my papa,

852
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:05,900
and go stick my stupid head
in the mouth of lions?

853
00:51:06,703 --> 00:51:08,935
Put-Putting your head
in-in a lion's mouth is art?

854
00:51:12,105 --> 00:51:16,544
No. Sticking your head in
the mouths of lions was balls.

855
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:21,251
Making sure the lion
don't eat my head, that is art.

856
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:25,920
You see, Tini,
she didn't say to Mitzi,

857
00:51:26,056 --> 00:51:27,788
"Go do what you gotta."

858
00:51:27,924 --> 00:51:31,794
I mean, she was a good person,
my sister, but she was scared.

859
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:33,329
Scared for your mother.

860
00:51:33,464 --> 00:51:35,228
- She should have safety in the family.
- Uh...

861
00:51:35,364 --> 00:51:37,502
So Mitzi, she gave it all up.

862
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,094
Ow! Wh...

863
00:51:40,229 --> 00:51:42,164
I want you should remember
how that hurt.

864
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:45,976
Because when they say all this,
when they say, "What you do?"

865
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:48,311
"Oh, that's cute. It's a hobby.

866
00:51:48,446 --> 00:51:50,246
It's like stamps
or butterfly collecting,"

867
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:52,213
you feel your face,
how it feels now.

868
00:51:52,348 --> 00:51:53,588
Yeah, you almost pulled it off.

869
00:51:53,723 --> 00:51:55,003
So you remember your Uncle Boris

870
00:51:55,131 --> 00:51:56,419
and what he's telling you.

871
00:51:56,554 --> 00:51:58,921
Because you're going to join
the circus, I can tell.

872
00:51:59,056 --> 00:52:00,352
You can't hardly wait.

873
00:52:00,488 --> 00:52:01,852
You want to be in the big top.

874
00:52:01,987 --> 00:52:04,294
You'll shovel elephant shit
until they say,

875
00:52:04,429 --> 00:52:07,129
"Okay, Sammy,
now ride the goddamn elephant."

876
00:52:07,264 --> 00:52:08,793
Oh, you love those people, huh?

877
00:52:08,928 --> 00:52:11,895
Your sisters, your mama,
your papa. Except...

878
00:52:13,167 --> 00:52:14,798
Except this.

879
00:52:14,933 --> 00:52:16,673
This, I think you love
a little more.

880
00:52:16,808 --> 00:52:17,907
No, I don't.

881
00:52:18,043 --> 00:52:19,770
Yeah.

882
00:52:19,905 --> 00:52:21,938
Oh, hey.
Run all you want, boy chick,

883
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:24,414
but you know I ain't
whistling Dixie here.

884
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:28,446
You'll make your movies,
and you will do your art.

885
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:31,581
And you'll remember how it hurt.

886
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:34,018
So you know what I'm saying?

887
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:37,561
Art will give you crowns in
heaven and laurels on earth.

888
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,363
But

889
00:52:39,498 --> 00:52:43,563
it'll tear your heart out
and leave you lonely.

890
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:46,066
You'll be a shanda
for your loved ones.

891
00:52:46,202 --> 00:52:48,131
An exile in the desert.

892
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:49,933
A gypsy.

893
00:52:51,073 --> 00:52:52,670
Art is no game.

894
00:52:52,805 --> 00:52:54,471
Art is dangerous
as a lion's mouth.

895
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,278
It'll bite your head off.

896
00:52:58,443 --> 00:52:59,910
Look at me.

897
00:53:01,215 --> 00:53:03,653
Look at me.

898
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:07,416
Is it a wonder that Tini, she
wanted nothing to do with me?

899
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,926
With me, with...

900
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:12,158
Oh, Tini.

901
00:53:12,294 --> 00:53:16,267
Oh, Tini! Oh, Tini.

902
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,227
I...

903
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:24,704
Stop, stop! Stop it!

904
00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,273
What, you never saw
nobody grieving before?

905
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:35,451
Let's go to sleep, bubbala.

906
00:53:42,892 --> 00:53:45,094
Uh, you can sleep in the bed.
I have my sleeping bag.

907
00:53:45,229 --> 00:53:46,509
I'm sitting Shiva for my sister.

908
00:53:46,625 --> 00:53:47,891
I sleep on the floor.

909
00:53:48,027 --> 00:53:49,528
Y-You want to sleep
on the floor, too?

910
00:53:49,663 --> 00:53:51,862
She was your grandma.

911
00:53:51,998 --> 00:53:55,003
Tear your clothes.
Sleep on the floor.

912
00:53:55,139 --> 00:53:57,341
Good night.

913
00:54:10,552 --> 00:54:12,820
- Say "bye-bye."
- Bye-bye.

914
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:14,150
Bye-bye.

915
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:01,305
I don't know what Mama
was so worried about.

916
00:55:01,441 --> 00:55:04,705
It was a nice visit.

917
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:03,365
Yuck.

918
01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:14,170
BENNIE: Whoa!

919
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:16,813
GIRLS: Oh!

920
01:01:21,586 --> 01:01:24,348
MITZI and GIRLS:
Aw.

921
01:01:26,523 --> 01:01:30,160
This is the life.

922
01:01:40,465 --> 01:01:43,807
Only you can prevent
forest fires.

923
01:02:11,799 --> 01:02:13,463
MITZI:
Mm.

924
01:02:23,878 --> 01:02:26,377
Oh.

925
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:33,021
It's so beautiful,
what you made, dolly.

926
01:02:33,788 --> 01:02:36,222
You really see me.

927
01:02:43,462 --> 01:02:45,229
BENNIE:
Hey, man. How about that, huh?

928
01:02:45,365 --> 01:02:48,166
BURT:
Hey, Sammy, that was real neat.

929
01:02:52,477 --> 01:02:53,807
Die,<i> Amerikaner!</i>

930
01:02:55,243 --> 01:02:58,046
BOY:
Move! Move! Fall backwards!

931
01:03:02,146 --> 01:03:03,953
ALL:
Whoa!

932
01:03:04,752 --> 01:03:05,888
<i>Attacke!</i>

933
01:03:08,727 --> 01:03:09,992
Ah! Cover!

934
01:03:17,163 --> 01:03:19,166
Krauts, they're everywhere!

935
01:03:20,771 --> 01:03:22,499
There's too many of them!

936
01:03:45,487 --> 01:03:47,262
SAMMY:
Turn.

937
01:03:47,398 --> 01:03:48,398
Cut!

938
01:03:48,423 --> 01:03:51,198
Great. Now, um...

939
01:03:52,627 --> 01:03:54,034
Okay, come here. Come here.

940
01:03:54,169 --> 01:03:56,905
Um, you're standing here
a minute,

941
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:58,908
looking down
at what just happened.

942
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,044
- A whole minute?
- I'll give you a signal

943
01:04:01,179 --> 01:04:02,957
when I want you to start
to move, okay? So you're just...

944
01:04:02,981 --> 01:04:04,476
Like, you mean
I should count to 60?

945
01:04:04,611 --> 01:04:06,024
- What? No. No, no, no, no.
- Like, one Mississippi,

946
01:04:06,048 --> 01:04:06,911
two Mississippi, and then move?

947
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:08,111
Don't-don't count to 60.

948
01:04:08,247 --> 01:04:10,347
You just got to...

949
01:04:10,483 --> 01:04:13,356
S-S-So... So you're all
like-like-like,

950
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:14,923
"Oh, my God."

951
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:19,161
Like, "All my men,
they're all

952
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:21,216
they're all dead.
All my men, they're-they're..."

953
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:24,367
So you want me to,
like, act and stuff.

954
01:04:24,503 --> 01:04:25,959
Well... yeah.

955
01:04:26,094 --> 01:04:27,711
- Like I'm-I'm sort of sad or something?
- Right.

956
01:04:27,735 --> 01:04:30,016
- Um, that's the whole point.
- 'Cause my whole platoon...

957
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:31,298
R-Right, right. Your platoon.

958
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,674
Your... Your men!

959
01:04:33,810 --> 01:04:36,613
They've been wiped out.

960
01:04:36,748 --> 01:04:39,675
These guys, they're your family.

961
01:04:41,114 --> 01:04:42,652
Your family's being,

962
01:04:42,788 --> 01:04:44,817
like, murdered,

963
01:04:44,953 --> 01:04:46,722
and it's your fault.

964
01:04:46,857 --> 01:04:48,891
You did this to them, and you...

965
01:04:49,027 --> 01:04:50,427
I-I thought it was
the Nazis that...

966
01:04:50,525 --> 01:04:52,323
Okay, yeah, but it was you
who gave the order

967
01:04:52,459 --> 01:04:54,060
to go down into
the Valley of Death.

968
01:04:54,196 --> 01:04:55,356
- Okay? You decided.
- Mm-hmm.

969
01:04:55,426 --> 01:04:57,497
Nobody else. You could've...

970
01:04:57,633 --> 01:04:59,363
Mm-hmm.

971
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:01,598
You could've protected them.
Okay?

972
01:05:01,733 --> 01:05:05,406
'Cause they trusted you,
and they loved you.

973
01:05:05,542 --> 01:05:06,542
Mm-hmm.

974
01:05:06,604 --> 01:05:12,114
Now you're just looking
at this

975
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:17,887
at this thing
that you've done,

976
01:05:18,022 --> 01:05:22,251
and... you can't
save them anymore.

977
01:05:22,387 --> 01:05:25,160
Because they're all dead.

978
01:05:26,491 --> 01:05:28,691
- Wow, that's, uh...
- Yeah.

979
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:31,531
...real gung ho.

980
01:05:33,164 --> 01:05:35,199
Okay. Okay.

981
01:05:35,335 --> 01:05:36,863
- You good?
- Lock and load.

982
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:38,539
Yeah. Yeah. Lock and load.
All right.

983
01:05:38,674 --> 01:05:40,036
Good.

984
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,330
Uh, Sammy?

985
01:06:38,466 --> 01:06:41,104
How far are you
gonna let him walk?

986
01:06:43,101 --> 01:06:44,300
Cut!

987
01:06:49,509 --> 01:06:51,307
BOY:
Hey, that's a cut, Angelo!

988
01:06:51,443 --> 01:06:53,377
- BOYS: Angelo!
- Angelo!

989
01:06:53,513 --> 01:06:54,643
BOYS:
Come back! Come back!

990
01:06:54,779 --> 01:06:56,920
- He said, "Cut!"
- Angelo, hey! -Angelo!

991
01:09:06,548 --> 01:09:08,779
MAN: Bravo!

992
01:09:10,578 --> 01:09:12,215
Bravo!

993
01:09:20,027 --> 01:09:21,429
Sammy!

994
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:28,333
Oh, dolly!

995
01:09:28,469 --> 01:09:31,367
You're not a civilian anymore.

996
01:09:31,503 --> 01:09:33,776
That movie, my God.

997
01:09:33,911 --> 01:09:35,938
It was...

998
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:38,611
ROGER:
Hi, Mrs. Fabelman.

999
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,053
Mr. DeMille.

1000
01:09:48,188 --> 01:09:49,721
Come here.

1001
01:09:50,891 --> 01:09:53,096
- Hey, there he is.
- Congratulations, young man.

1002
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:54,661
- Congratulations.
- Hey. Hey, hey.

1003
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:56,509
I guess you based it on
your dad's war stories, huh?

1004
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:58,006
SAMMY: Sort of.
You know, but he doesn't like

1005
01:09:58,030 --> 01:09:59,710
- to talk about it, so...
- MAN: No, I understand.

1006
01:09:59,734 --> 01:10:00,934
SAMMY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1007
01:10:00,999 --> 01:10:03,004
Dad, Mom's getting a ride
with Bennie.

1008
01:10:03,139 --> 01:10:04,303
She'll see us at home.

1009
01:10:04,438 --> 01:10:05,718
Hey, that last scene with the...

1010
01:10:05,772 --> 01:10:07,252
REGGIE:
Why do you like blood so much?

1011
01:10:07,336 --> 01:10:08,418
NATALIE: And are you ever
gonna make a movie

1012
01:10:08,442 --> 01:10:09,839
with parts for girls again?

1013
01:10:09,974 --> 01:10:11,545
- ANGELO: Yeah.
- MAN: Make a career...

1014
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,360
- What?
- NATALIE: With girls, you know, like,

1015
01:10:13,410 --> 01:10:15,985
because all the men stare off
into the distance all the time,

1016
01:10:16,120 --> 01:10:17,852
maybe a girl could save the day.

1017
01:10:19,614 --> 01:10:21,984
Okay, what are the five steps
to save a drowning person?

1018
01:10:22,120 --> 01:10:24,090
All right, one is
you swim behind the person

1019
01:10:24,226 --> 01:10:25,426
so they don't grab you.

1020
01:10:25,562 --> 01:10:27,622
Two, you throw your arm
across his chest.

1021
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:29,332
- Or her chest.
- Three.

1022
01:10:29,468 --> 01:10:31,228
Not Sammy. He's too scared
of girls' boobies.

1023
01:10:31,362 --> 01:10:33,426
Three, you swim
on your back with the victim

1024
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:35,682
on your chest, using your
free arm to paddle yourself.

1025
01:10:35,706 --> 01:10:37,502
And speaking of boobies,
if you ever get any,

1026
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:38,903
we'll have a party. Um...

1027
01:10:39,038 --> 01:10:40,958
And at the party,
we'll give her the booby prize.

1028
01:10:40,982 --> 01:10:43,272
Ha-ha. What's four?

1029
01:10:43,407 --> 01:10:44,974
Um...

1030
01:10:47,283 --> 01:10:48,578
Crap.

1031
01:10:48,713 --> 01:10:50,218
Bring the victim to land, dummy.

1032
01:10:50,353 --> 01:10:52,320
- SAMMY: Mm.
- Then five?

1033
01:10:52,456 --> 01:10:55,725
Call the undertaker.

1034
01:10:59,229 --> 01:11:00,794
This is serious business.

1035
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:03,290
I got to know all of this to
get the lifesaving merit badge.

1036
01:11:03,314 --> 01:11:05,630
More kids die
in swimming accidents

1037
01:11:05,766 --> 01:11:07,166
than in any other kind
of accident.

1038
01:11:07,301 --> 01:11:08,334
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1039
01:11:08,470 --> 01:11:09,867
Not everything is a big joke.

1040
01:11:10,002 --> 01:11:12,208
Okay, okay.
So what's step number five?

1041
01:11:12,344 --> 01:11:14,174
It's just...
You laugh at everything,

1042
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:15,576
even when nothing's funny.

1043
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:17,511
You always have to be
the center of attention.

1044
01:11:17,535 --> 01:11:20,977
Eat. And don't talk
with your mouth full.

1045
01:11:21,113 --> 01:11:24,146
I'm not eating this crud
before a swimming test.

1046
01:11:24,281 --> 01:11:26,487
You can get cramps in the water
if you eat before,

1047
01:11:26,623 --> 01:11:28,386
and you can drown
from getting cramps!

1048
01:11:28,521 --> 01:11:29,619
Stop shouting at her!

1049
01:11:29,754 --> 01:11:32,025
Sammy Fabelman, goddamn it!

1050
01:11:32,161 --> 01:11:33,396
For weeks now,

1051
01:11:33,531 --> 01:11:35,732
it has been nothing
but disrespect from you!

1052
01:11:35,867 --> 01:11:36,993
Disrespect?!

1053
01:11:37,129 --> 01:11:39,158
Why are you being
such a little shit to me?!

1054
01:11:39,294 --> 01:11:40,614
Damn it to hell,
I am your mother!

1055
01:11:40,731 --> 01:11:43,032
I wish you weren't!

1056
01:12:06,359 --> 01:12:10,030
Oh. Let me see.

1057
01:12:10,165 --> 01:12:12,034
Oh, my God.

1058
01:12:12,169 --> 01:12:13,264
Oh, what have I done?

1059
01:12:19,209 --> 01:12:20,773
Talk to me.

1060
01:12:21,675 --> 01:12:23,507
Oh, Sammy, please talk to me.

1061
01:12:23,643 --> 01:12:25,041
Tell me what's happening.

1062
01:12:25,176 --> 01:12:30,112
Do you have any idea
how much I love you?

1063
01:12:39,194 --> 01:12:41,057
Don't go.

1064
01:15:23,522 --> 01:15:24,924
Mom.

1065
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,223
Mom.

1066
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:31,326
I won't tell.

1067
01:15:33,436 --> 01:15:35,671
I won't tell. I won't.

1068
01:15:36,968 --> 01:15:39,237
I won't tell.

1069
01:15:39,373 --> 01:15:40,940
I won't.

1070
01:16:01,825 --> 01:16:03,765
Sure about this?

1071
01:16:05,168 --> 01:16:06,735
Mm-hmm.

1072
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:10,935
There you go.
Bought and paid for.

1073
01:16:11,071 --> 01:16:13,742
Oh. Just a second.
It's in the back.

1074
01:16:17,507 --> 01:16:19,609
Stocking up on Kodak
before the big move?

1075
01:16:19,744 --> 01:16:21,080
N-No, I'm...

1076
01:16:21,215 --> 01:16:23,214
Smart. Film's cheaper here
than in California.

1077
01:16:23,349 --> 01:16:26,181
I bet everything's
more expensive there.

1078
01:16:26,317 --> 01:16:27,856
You're losing
your steadiest customer.

1079
01:16:27,991 --> 01:16:32,493
Him and his whole family,
they're moving west.

1080
01:16:32,628 --> 01:16:34,592
He just sold me his camera.

1081
01:16:34,728 --> 01:16:36,858
Oh, yeah? How come?

1082
01:16:36,994 --> 01:16:38,367
Says he's finished.

1083
01:16:38,502 --> 01:16:40,567
Sorry about the wait, Mr. Loewy.

1084
01:16:40,702 --> 01:16:42,501
We had to order it special.

1085
01:16:42,637 --> 01:16:44,201
You bought a camera?

1086
01:16:47,707 --> 01:16:49,373
It's for you!

1087
01:16:49,509 --> 01:16:51,747
I know how much you loved
using it for your war picture,

1088
01:16:51,882 --> 01:16:53,722
so I figured you ought to have
one of your own.

1089
01:16:53,746 --> 01:16:58,183
It's, um, a "bon voyage,"
"see you later, alligator,"

1090
01:16:58,318 --> 01:17:01,922
"I believe in you" present
from your uncle Bennie.

1091
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,968
Because it's from me?

1092
01:17:16,768 --> 01:17:18,971
This move? Huh?

1093
01:17:19,107 --> 01:17:22,010
This is your dad's
glory-hallelujah moment.

1094
01:17:22,145 --> 01:17:25,614
And, oy vavoy, Sammy,
does that guy ever deserve it.

1095
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,277
All the way back when,
back at RCA,

1096
01:17:27,412 --> 01:17:29,012
he knew what computing
was gonna be about

1097
01:17:29,084 --> 01:17:31,384
before practically
anybody else knew it.

1098
01:17:33,124 --> 01:17:35,186
And IBM?

1099
01:17:35,322 --> 01:17:37,152
That's where guys like Burt
are figuring out

1100
01:17:37,287 --> 01:17:39,894
how to use what he's made to...

1101
01:17:40,029 --> 01:17:41,959
They're gonna change
the whole goddamn world,

1102
01:17:42,094 --> 01:17:44,459
so this was the right decision.

1103
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:50,102
For all sorts of reasons.

1104
01:17:53,038 --> 01:17:56,244
Yeah, so I'm happy for you.

1105
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,346
You know I am.

1106
01:17:58,482 --> 01:18:00,178
But I'm gonna miss you.

1107
01:18:00,978 --> 01:18:03,214
All of you, a lot.

1108
01:18:10,293 --> 01:18:12,659
You think whatever bad things
you want about me, kiddo,

1109
01:18:12,794 --> 01:18:13,957
but you stop making movies,

1110
01:18:14,092 --> 01:18:16,732
it'll break your mother's heart.

1111
01:18:16,867 --> 01:18:19,329
You will break her heart,
I mean it.

1112
01:18:20,466 --> 01:18:22,536
She doesn't deserve that,
not from anybody,

1113
01:18:22,671 --> 01:18:25,071
least of all from you.

1114
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:40,713
I'll give you 35 bucks for it.

1115
01:18:41,549 --> 01:18:43,793
You drive a hard bargain, kid.

1116
01:19:00,977 --> 01:19:03,177
I'm still done
making movies, though.

1117
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:06,783
Everybody makes movies
in California.

1118
01:19:15,369 --> 01:19:16,369
Hey!

1119
01:19:16,393 --> 01:19:18,060

01:19:33,908 --> 01:19:36,675
A few months, in the spring.

1126
01:19:36,811 --> 01:19:38,547
Can I have my own room?

1127
01:19:38,683 --> 01:19:40,976
Everybody gets their own room.

1128
01:19:41,112 --> 01:19:43,347
- Yay!
- Yes!

1129
01:19:49,556 --> 01:19:51,955
I just remembered, last night,
I had a funny dream.

1130
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:53,696
REGGIE:
What was it?

1131
01:19:53,831 --> 01:19:56,163
I-I can't believe
I dreamed this.

1132
01:19:56,299 --> 01:19:59,034
Uh, uh, uh, Bennie and me
were having an argument,

1133
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:03,169

Is Mommy carsick?

1139
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:21,418
Let's just give her
a little time.

1140
01:20:44,443 --> 01:20:47,448
Bennie and me, we never

1141
01:20:47,583 --> 01:20:49,547
we never...

1142
01:20:52,883 --> 01:20:55,485
I would never let it get
as far as I imagine you think.

1143
01:20:55,621 --> 01:20:58,856
Oh, I never
imagined any of that.

1144
01:20:58,992 --> 01:21:01,596
You think Dad knows?

1145
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,029
I don't... I don't mean...

1146
01:21:03,165 --> 01:21:04,565
I don't mean,
"Did you tell him?"

1147
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,067
I know you didn't.

1148
01:21:06,865 --> 01:21:08,630
But...

1149
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:15,604
But you think he has an inkling?

1150
01:21:19,379 --> 01:21:21,247
I've almost told him
so many times.

1151
01:21:21,382 --> 01:21:23,651
I'll say,
"Burt, there's something

1152
01:21:23,786 --> 01:21:26,120
I've got to tell you."

1153
01:21:26,255 --> 01:21:28,122
Then he looks at me
like he can't conceive

1154
01:21:28,257 --> 01:21:29,892
that anything
could be wrong between us,

1155
01:21:30,028 --> 01:21:32,458
so instead, I say,
"Burt, we got ants."

1156
01:21:34,626 --> 01:21:36,263
Or, "Burt, could you climb
on the roof

1157
01:21:36,398 --> 01:21:38,296
and turn the antenna
so I can watch channel 5?"

1158
01:21:38,432 --> 01:21:41,003
Which, of course, he does.

1159
01:21:45,535 --> 01:21:48,373
I can't fight with your father.

1160
01:21:50,341 --> 01:21:53,180
He kills with such kindness.

1161
01:21:54,975 --> 01:21:56,783
I'm mean to him,
he buys me a dress.

1162
01:21:56,918 --> 01:21:59,714
From Saks.

1163
01:22:02,587 --> 01:22:04,389
Mom, when I showed you
what I filmed,

1164
01:22:04,524 --> 01:22:06,593
I never meant
for any of this to happen.

1165
01:22:06,728 --> 01:22:08,723
Oh... mmm.

1166
01:22:11,263 --> 01:22:13,662
Guilt is a wasted emotion.

1167
01:22:14,968 --> 01:22:16,467
SAMMY:
Hmm.

1168
01:22:19,635 --> 01:22:22,506
What's gonna happen now?

1169
01:22:25,881 --> 01:22:27,749
I'm gonna be your mom.

1170
01:22:27,884 --> 01:22:31,313
I'm gonna be the girls' mom.

1171
01:22:31,448 --> 01:22:33,187
Despite my countless faults,

1172
01:22:33,322 --> 01:22:35,657
I'm not ruining everything
for everyone.

1173
01:22:35,793 --> 01:22:37,994
I'm gonna not be selfish.

1174
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:43,830
Burt Fabelman is the kindest,
smartest, wisest,

1175
01:22:43,966 --> 01:22:46,394
most patient, most decent,

1176
01:22:46,529 --> 01:22:48,497
most understanding man there is,

1177
01:22:48,632 --> 01:22:51,601
and I'm gonna stay married
to him.

1178
01:23:14,226 --> 01:23:16,259
It's only a rental.

1179
01:23:16,394 --> 01:23:17,626
The new house will be ready

1180
01:23:17,761 --> 01:23:19,831
faster than you can say
"Jack Robinson."

1181
01:23:19,967 --> 01:23:22,236
Jack Robinson.

1182
01:23:24,104 --> 01:23:26,207
And we're still here.

1183
01:23:27,738 --> 01:23:29,138
Just tell me if
you're going to mope

1184
01:23:29,162 --> 01:23:30,310
for the rest of your life

1185
01:23:30,445 --> 01:23:32,045
or if it's something
you plan to outgrow.

1186
01:23:32,069 --> 01:23:32,840
Bug off.

1187
01:23:32,975 --> 01:23:34,815
You're, like, going for
the misery merit badge,

1188
01:23:34,839 --> 01:23:36,483
you and Mom
with your long faces.

1189
01:23:36,619 --> 01:23:38,786
She can't even get out of bed
to make breakfast and...

1190
01:23:38,921 --> 01:23:40,187
Okay, new rule, guys.

1191
01:23:40,323 --> 01:23:42,024
Um, when we walk to school
in the morning,

1192
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,226
let's just leave
all the Fabelman mishegoss

1193
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:46,361
behind us in the Fabelmans'
moldy old rental house.

1194
01:23:46,495 --> 01:23:48,656
So, for eight hours a day,
let's be normal kids

1195
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,765
in an ordinary,
normal school, okay?

1196
01:23:52,336 --> 01:23:54,096
STUDENT: Some glue
on your hand or something.

1197
01:23:55,272 --> 01:23:56,912
- Too easy.
- That's what I'm telling you.

1198
01:23:57,006 --> 01:23:59,471
It's like we got parachuted

1199
01:23:59,606 --> 01:24:02,678
into the land of
the giant sequoia people.

1200
01:24:02,813 --> 01:24:04,608
REGGIE:
All right.

1201
01:24:04,743 --> 01:24:07,842
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1202
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:11,718
Up over! Nice dig.

1203
01:24:11,854 --> 01:24:13,122
Atta Johnson.

1204
01:24:13,257 --> 01:24:15,858
- I got it. I got it.
- Get it up. Get it up.

1205
01:24:15,993 --> 01:24:17,858
- Oh!
- Set, set, set, set.

1206
01:24:17,994 --> 01:24:19,462
- Hit it.
- Take it.

1207
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:20,796
I got it.

1208
01:24:20,931 --> 01:24:23,393
COACH:
Way to get up!

1209
01:24:23,528 --> 01:24:25,765
Nice.

1210
01:24:26,969 --> 01:24:29,934
Nice. Attababy, Logan.

1211
01:24:32,073 --> 01:24:33,472
Do it again. Go again.

1212
01:24:33,607 --> 01:24:36,110
STUDENT: Come on, boys.

1213
01:24:36,246 --> 01:24:37,978
COACH: Good work, guys.

1214
01:24:38,113 --> 01:24:40,149
Keep the intensity. Keep moving.

1215
01:24:42,050 --> 01:24:43,717
Rotate. Nice, Jake.

1216
01:24:43,852 --> 01:24:45,413
Good job, Chris.

1217
01:24:47,089 --> 01:24:48,452
Fabelman, it won't hurt you.

1218
01:24:48,588 --> 01:24:50,059
It's a volleyball,
not a cannonball.

1219
01:24:50,194 --> 01:24:52,892
Okay. Let's go. Serve.

1220
01:24:53,027 --> 01:24:54,453
COACH:
Go!

1221
01:24:54,588 --> 01:24:55,654
Attababy!

1222
01:24:55,789 --> 01:24:56,896
That's good reactions.

1223
01:24:57,032 --> 01:24:58,132
Let's move. Let's...

1224
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:02,633
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I didn't... Oh, my...

1225
01:25:02,768 --> 01:25:05,134
I'm gonna murder you,
you piece of shit!

1226
01:25:05,269 --> 01:25:07,143
Hey, Chad.

1227
01:25:08,909 --> 01:25:10,379
Cool it.

1228
01:25:11,182 --> 01:25:12,710
I am... I did not mean
to do that.

1229
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:14,881
- Are you okay? I'm...
- That really hurt, asshole.

1230
01:25:15,017 --> 01:25:17,186
Watch your mouth, Logan.

1231
01:25:22,386 --> 01:25:24,426
Go fetch the ball.

1232
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:27,119
Sure, yeah.

1233
01:25:28,088 --> 01:25:30,566
- LOGAN: Let's go.
- SAMMY: Mm-hmm.

1234
01:25:32,968 --> 01:25:35,033
Hey, new kid.

1235
01:25:35,168 --> 01:25:37,206
What's your name?

1236
01:25:39,137 --> 01:25:40,972
Sam.

1237
01:25:41,107 --> 01:25:43,542
Sam what?

1238
01:25:46,607 --> 01:25:48,481
Fabelman.

1239
01:25:50,987 --> 01:25:52,821
Told you he's a kike.

1240
01:25:52,956 --> 01:25:54,584
He doesn't like Jews.

1241
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:57,254
Nobody likes Jews.

1242
01:25:57,390 --> 01:26:00,262
Except other Jews, right?

1243
01:26:01,358 --> 01:26:03,765
So, Bagelman...

1244
01:26:03,901 --> 01:26:05,297
No, that's not my name.

1245
01:26:05,432 --> 01:26:07,027
- Don't call me that.
- So

1246
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:09,336
you gave my best friend
a concussion, Bagelman.

1247
01:26:09,471 --> 01:26:11,971
- No, I didn't. Leave me alone.
- Hey.

1248
01:26:12,107 --> 01:26:14,106
Don't argue with me.

1249
01:26:14,241 --> 01:26:16,542
A serious concussion.

1250
01:26:17,641 --> 01:26:19,941
So, how do we make you pay?

1251
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:22,348
How about this? We...

1252
01:26:22,483 --> 01:26:23,947
You're drinking
from the fountain.

1253
01:26:24,082 --> 01:26:27,215
You never hear me come up
from behind you, and bam!

1254
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:30,692
I shatter your front teeth
all over the spigot...

1255
01:26:33,390 --> 01:26:34,995
...Hey, look at me.

1256
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:40,368
He's demented, like, medically.

1257
01:26:41,236 --> 01:26:43,135
So watch out for yourself.

1258
01:27:06,693 --> 01:27:08,831
Close the door!

1259
01:27:14,801 --> 01:27:17,301
- Mom got a monkey.
- Why'd you get a monkey?

1260
01:27:17,437 --> 01:27:18,868
'Cause I needed to laugh.

1261
01:27:22,138 --> 01:27:23,575
MITZI: Oh, help me with this.

1262
01:27:23,710 --> 01:27:25,640
The directions don't make
any sense.

1263
01:27:25,776 --> 01:27:27,543
REGGIE:
Careful. Careful.

1264
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:29,714
NATALIE:
Get down!

1265
01:27:30,514 --> 01:27:32,616
I'll get a banana.

1266
01:27:32,751 --> 01:27:35,223
Save the curtains.
They're rented.

1267
01:27:42,964 --> 01:27:44,663
Oh.

1268
01:27:45,902 --> 01:27:47,098
Uh, hello.

1269
01:27:47,233 --> 01:27:48,770
Who are you?

1270
01:27:48,905 --> 01:27:50,434
He's mine.

1271
01:27:50,569 --> 01:27:52,737
What are we gonna call him?

1272
01:27:53,572 --> 01:27:56,108
Bennie. His name's Bennie.

1273
01:28:02,915 --> 01:28:05,150
I don't want to see
a psychiatrist, Burt.

1274
01:28:05,286 --> 01:28:06,382
You're scaring the kids.

1275
01:28:06,518 --> 01:28:07,648
You're sleeping all day.

1276
01:28:07,784 --> 01:28:09,351
I miss the desert.

1277
01:28:09,486 --> 01:28:10,952
I miss dry heat.

1278
01:28:11,087 --> 01:28:12,823
You haven't even unwrapped
the piano.

1279
01:28:12,959 --> 01:28:15,824
You aren't cooking
or shopping or unpacking.

1280
01:28:15,959 --> 01:28:17,593
MITZI:
Psychiatrists help you know

1281
01:28:17,729 --> 01:28:19,533
why you're feeling something.

1282
01:28:19,668 --> 01:28:21,428
They can't help you feel
something different.

1283
01:28:21,505 --> 01:28:23,404
You're behaving
like when your mother died,

1284
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:26,903
like you're in mourning,
but nobody's died.

1285
01:28:29,076 --> 01:28:30,611
Okay.

1286
01:28:31,514 --> 01:28:34,614
So I'll call the monkey
some other name.

1287
01:28:47,693 --> 01:28:50,630
IBM's out of his league, Mitz.

1288
01:28:52,102 --> 01:28:54,969
Bennie was... He

1289
01:28:55,104 --> 01:28:58,467
is my best friend.

1290
01:28:58,603 --> 01:29:00,469
But they don't need him.

1291
01:29:00,605 --> 01:29:02,741
This is what I know.

1292
01:29:04,511 --> 01:29:06,646
I don't need him, either.

1293
01:29:08,779 --> 01:29:11,420
Bennie wasn't your friend.

1294
01:29:12,354 --> 01:29:14,951
But you knew he was mine.

1295
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,395
What does that mean?

1296
01:30:15,751 --> 01:30:18,317
Logan, I'm really,
really missing you.

1297
01:30:22,358 --> 01:30:23,753
Hey!

1298
01:30:23,889 --> 01:30:25,553
Who's there?

1299
01:30:25,688 --> 01:30:27,925
Who's there?

1300
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:41,675
Bagelman, yo.

1301
01:30:53,151 --> 01:30:55,286
I left you a little snack
in your locker.

1302
01:30:55,421 --> 01:30:57,355
Did you like it?

1303
01:30:57,491 --> 01:30:58,754
Guess he wasn't hungry.

1304
01:30:58,889 --> 01:31:00,758
Uh, he said... he said it was...

1305
01:31:00,893 --> 01:31:02,729
- What'd you call it, Chad?
- Kosher.

1306
01:31:02,864 --> 01:31:05,133
- Kosher.
- Knock it off, moron!

1307
01:31:05,268 --> 01:31:07,936
We talked about this.

1308
01:31:08,071 --> 01:31:09,702
All right.

1309
01:31:09,837 --> 01:31:12,233
Come on.
We'll be late for practice.

1310
01:31:14,775 --> 01:31:17,579
So, what is this?
Are you Jewish?

1311
01:31:20,577 --> 01:31:21,880
Well...

1312
01:31:22,016 --> 01:31:23,712
Holy crap.
He's got the hots so bad,

1313
01:31:23,848 --> 01:31:25,415
he can't even talk to her.

1314
01:31:25,550 --> 01:31:27,946
No, I don't.

1315
01:31:28,081 --> 01:31:30,156
Apologize to her.

1316
01:31:30,291 --> 01:31:32,221
For what?

1317
01:31:32,356 --> 01:31:35,119
For making goo-goo eyes at her,
for drooling at her.

1318
01:31:35,255 --> 01:31:37,258
I wasn't drooling at her.

1319
01:31:37,393 --> 01:31:40,228
Then apologize to her
for killing Christ.

1320
01:31:40,363 --> 01:31:43,638
Why are you encouraging him?

1321
01:31:44,634 --> 01:31:45,837
Go on.

1322
01:31:45,973 --> 01:31:49,204
Apologize to her
for killing our Lord.

1323
01:31:50,578 --> 01:31:52,876
LOGAN:
Ugh. Don't go.

1324
01:31:53,012 --> 01:31:54,681
- Come watch me run.
- No, thanks.

1325
01:31:54,817 --> 01:31:56,377
- I'm not in the mood now.
- Oh, please.

1326
01:31:56,401 --> 01:31:57,834
I run better when you are there.

1327
01:31:57,954 --> 01:32:00,483
Apologize to her, you
Christ-killing son of a bitch!

1328
01:32:00,618 --> 01:32:02,450
I'm going home.

1329
01:32:04,492 --> 01:32:06,155
Go on and say sorry.

1330
01:32:06,290 --> 01:32:08,961
You're getting me in trouble
with my girl.

1331
01:32:09,097 --> 01:32:11,799
You know, obviously,
since I'm not 2,000 years old

1332
01:32:11,934 --> 01:32:14,968
and have never been to Rome,
I'm not apologizing.

1333
01:32:15,103 --> 01:32:17,804
But hey, you know, maybe, uh,
your boyfriend should

1334
01:32:17,940 --> 01:32:20,035
apologize to you
for making out in the stairwell

1335
01:32:20,170 --> 01:32:22,743
half an hour ago
with some redhead.

1336
01:32:22,878 --> 01:32:25,110
He-he's lying. He's...
I-I didn't do that.

1337
01:32:25,246 --> 01:32:26,307
I swear.

1338
01:32:26,442 --> 01:32:28,243
You told me
you were finished with her.

1339
01:32:29,682 --> 01:32:33,017
Logan, you lied to me!

1340
01:32:35,322 --> 01:32:36,658
Claudia.

1341
01:32:40,030 --> 01:32:42,928
Whoa...

1342
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:47,766
You made a mistake.
Listen to me.

1343
01:32:47,901 --> 01:32:49,132
You made a mistake.

1344
01:32:49,267 --> 01:32:50,907
- You're gonna fix it.
- Bash his head in!

1345
01:32:50,931 --> 01:32:52,413
Shut up, Chad, goddamn it!

1346
01:32:52,469 --> 01:32:54,609
Tomorrow, you're gonna
find her first thing,

1347
01:32:54,745 --> 01:32:56,345
and you're gonna tell her
you were lying.

1348
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:57,812
Say-say you were, um, scared.

1349
01:32:57,947 --> 01:32:59,867
Say-say whatever you
got to say, but you tell her

1350
01:32:59,891 --> 01:33:02,317
it wasn't true and you did not
see me doing that.

1351
01:33:02,452 --> 01:33:04,684
Or I swear, I will hurt you

1352
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:07,051
worse than
you've ever been hurt.

1353
01:33:08,488 --> 01:33:09,755
You get me?

1354
01:33:09,891 --> 01:33:12,661
Nod to show
you dig what I'm saying.

1355
01:33:25,575 --> 01:33:27,136
He won't tell me who did this.

1356
01:33:27,271 --> 01:33:29,338
Ask him who did this.

1357
01:33:29,473 --> 01:33:31,372
Tell your father who did this,
and he will drive

1358
01:33:31,507 --> 01:33:33,267
to that little shit's house,
and he will beat

1359
01:33:33,319 --> 01:33:35,359
- the living crap out of him.
- Is your nose broken?

1360
01:33:35,383 --> 01:33:37,224
No, of course it's not broken.
You think I'd be sitting here

1361
01:33:37,248 --> 01:33:38,808
- if his nose was broken?
- Who hit you?

1362
01:33:38,832 --> 01:33:40,325
What do you care who it was?

1363
01:33:40,384 --> 01:33:42,049
It's not like
you'll do anything about it.

1364
01:33:42,184 --> 01:33:43,655
Tell me what happened first.

1365
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,453
What happened is I hate it here,

1366
01:33:45,589 --> 01:33:48,796
and what happened is
you brought us here because...

1367
01:33:48,931 --> 01:33:51,060
Because I got a better job,
so we moved.

1368
01:33:51,195 --> 01:33:53,901
You don't even care
where you are.

1369
01:33:54,036 --> 01:33:56,231
You get to go to work,
and that could be in Iceland.

1370
01:33:56,367 --> 01:33:58,499
You're working
with your goddamn machines,

1371
01:33:58,634 --> 01:34:01,606
so you get to be happy
while the rest of us are mis...

1372
01:34:01,742 --> 01:34:03,107
- Just, come on.
- Don't.

1373
01:34:03,242 --> 01:34:04,962
Well, but you-you're bleeding
on the carpet.

1374
01:34:04,986 --> 01:34:06,110
It's a rental house.

1375
01:34:06,246 --> 01:34:08,213
Do you even notice
how much we hate it here,

1376
01:34:08,349 --> 01:34:11,582
where we're practically the
only Jewish people for miles

1377
01:34:11,718 --> 01:34:13,854
and everything is awful?

1378
01:34:13,989 --> 01:34:17,625
Do you even care
that this is your fault...

1379
01:34:17,748 --> 01:34:19,068
Everything
that's happening now...

1380
01:34:19,092 --> 01:34:20,593
Just because
you ran away from home

1381
01:34:20,729 --> 01:34:21,961
and took all of us with you?!

1382
01:34:22,097 --> 01:34:24,159
I came here so I could work
ten times harder

1383
01:34:24,294 --> 01:34:25,700
with ten times
the responsibility,

1384
01:34:25,828 --> 01:34:27,308
which seems to have escaped
everybody,

1385
01:34:27,332 --> 01:34:28,892
s-so I could build us
a nice home and...

1386
01:34:28,938 --> 01:34:30,311
Could everyone settle?
I want to say something.

1387
01:34:30,335 --> 01:34:32,095
No, no. You didn't come here
to build houses.

1388
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:33,799
You didn't come here to work.
You ran away.

1389
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,740
I think you have something
to say to me, Sammy!

1390
01:34:35,764 --> 01:34:37,010
And if I'm right about that,

1391
01:34:37,145 --> 01:34:39,065
then get it off your chest
and say it to my face!

1392
01:34:39,089 --> 01:34:41,490
I started therapy.

1393
01:36:16,072 --> 01:36:18,141
SAMMY:
Anyways,

1394
01:36:18,277 --> 01:36:20,143
what I really wanted
to say is that,

1395
01:36:20,279 --> 01:36:22,077
about yesterday,
what I told you was

1396
01:36:22,212 --> 01:36:24,318
it wasn't true, and I lied,

1397
01:36:24,454 --> 01:36:26,516
and I'm sorry.

1398
01:36:26,652 --> 01:36:28,087
But why?

1399
01:36:28,222 --> 01:36:30,090
- What did I ever do to you?
- Oh, no, no.

1400
01:36:30,226 --> 01:36:31,964
- It wasn't about you.
- Because that, like, really,

1401
01:36:31,988 --> 01:36:34,196
- really wasn't cool, you know?
- No, I didn't mean to hurt...

1402
01:36:34,220 --> 01:36:36,540
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- Because I really love Logan.

1403
01:36:36,589 --> 01:36:37,742
Yeah, she cried herself to sleep

1404
01:36:37,766 --> 01:36:38,863
thinking he cheated on her.

1405
01:36:38,998 --> 01:36:40,278
You ought to be more considerate

1406
01:36:40,302 --> 01:36:42,134
of other people's feelings.

1407
01:36:42,269 --> 01:36:44,109
Okay, but Logan told me
to say I killed Christ.

1408
01:36:44,133 --> 01:36:45,300
- That wasn't Logan.
- What?

1409
01:36:45,436 --> 01:36:46,996
- That was Chad.
- Why would he do that?

1410
01:36:47,043 --> 01:36:49,075
Logan laughed.
He thought it was hilarious.

1411
01:36:50,512 --> 01:36:52,412
He's Jewish.

1412
01:36:52,548 --> 01:36:54,239
You don't say.

1413
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:58,183
Yeah, I mean, since the day
I was circumcised.

1414
01:37:05,654 --> 01:37:08,091
So, how'd you know
she was a redhead?

1415
01:37:08,226 --> 01:37:10,194
- Oh, my God.
- SAMMY: Hmm?

1416
01:37:10,330 --> 01:37:12,560
He was making out
with Renee Reynolds?

1417
01:37:15,432 --> 01:37:17,365
- If you were lying...
- Mm-hmm?

1418
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:20,007
...how'd you know
her hair color?

1419
01:37:22,477 --> 01:37:24,308
Uh...

1420
01:37:29,915 --> 01:37:32,247
Does it hurt?

1421
01:37:32,382 --> 01:37:34,250
So, you don't believe in Jesus?

1422
01:37:34,386 --> 01:37:36,357
Monica's, like,
totally hot on Jesus.

1423
01:37:37,587 --> 01:37:39,059
I can't imagine my life
without him.

1424
01:37:39,194 --> 01:37:42,259
Well, we've managed
for like 5,000 years,

1425
01:37:42,395 --> 01:37:44,828
so I guess it's possible.

1426
01:37:44,963 --> 01:37:47,363
Maybe we could...

1427
01:37:47,499 --> 01:37:50,734
I don't know, get together
and pray on it.

1428
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:55,172
What, like, you and me?

1429
01:37:55,307 --> 01:37:57,238
We can ask him
to come into your heart

1430
01:37:57,373 --> 01:38:01,709
and, you know, see what happens.

1431
01:38:02,779 --> 01:38:04,784
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

1432
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:06,252
I mean...

1433
01:38:06,387 --> 01:38:09,089
What? Like, that would be,
like, when? Like, today?

1434
01:38:13,419 --> 01:38:16,257
It's a lot, huh?

1435
01:38:16,393 --> 01:38:20,061
It's sort of a shrine almost.

1436
01:38:20,196 --> 01:38:22,502
A shrine to guys.

1437
01:38:22,637 --> 01:38:23,998
L-Lots of guys.

1438
01:38:24,134 --> 01:38:26,570
They're sexy.

1439
01:38:26,706 --> 01:38:28,603
I guess.

1440
01:38:31,911 --> 01:38:33,777
I mean, not Jesus.

1441
01:38:33,913 --> 01:38:36,149
Jesus is sexy.

1442
01:38:37,318 --> 01:38:39,182
Isn't that, like,
a sin or something?

1443
01:38:39,317 --> 01:38:40,950
I don't know.

1444
01:38:41,086 --> 01:38:43,184
He came to us as a man.

1445
01:38:43,319 --> 01:38:45,917
A handsome young man.

1446
01:38:46,052 --> 01:38:48,994
He could've come as a girl
or an old man

1447
01:38:49,129 --> 01:38:50,999
or someone with leprosy, but...

1448
01:38:51,134 --> 01:38:53,331
Nobody knows
what he really looked like.

1449
01:38:54,167 --> 01:38:56,132
Probably, he looked like you.

1450
01:38:56,267 --> 01:38:58,668
Oh, because... because he was...

1451
01:38:58,804 --> 01:39:00,135
Jewish.

1452
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:02,505
A handsome Jewish boy.

1453
01:39:03,811 --> 01:39:05,981
Just like you.

1454
01:39:22,125 --> 01:39:24,065
Let's pray.

1455
01:39:30,496 --> 01:39:32,601
Close your eyes.

1456
01:39:34,505 --> 01:39:36,706
Lord, I'm here
with my friend Sammy...

1457
01:39:36,842 --> 01:39:37,978
Sam.

1458
01:39:38,114 --> 01:39:40,244
I'm here with
my good friend Sam,

1459
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:44,642
who's Jewish,
and he's a nice boy.

1460
01:39:44,777 --> 01:39:49,185
Lord Jesus, he's good and brave,

1461
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:53,219
and he's funny, Lord, and,

1462
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:56,229
and I like him.

1463
01:40:00,426 --> 01:40:02,334
Relax.

1464
01:40:06,872 --> 01:40:08,472
Ask.

1465
01:40:09,912 --> 01:40:11,569
Ask him to come into you.

1466
01:40:11,704 --> 01:40:14,115
Ask him to enter you.

1467
01:40:16,684 --> 01:40:18,585
Um

1468
01:40:18,720 --> 01:40:20,754
Hi there, Jesus.

1469
01:40:20,889 --> 01:40:23,619
It's me, Sam Fabelman.

1470
01:40:25,190 --> 01:40:27,327
If you're real, show me

1471
01:40:27,462 --> 01:40:29,582
- a sign or something, and...
- No, wait. You can't...

1472
01:40:29,695 --> 01:40:33,327
You can't ask Jesus
to do tricks to impress you.

1473
01:40:33,462 --> 01:40:35,167
You have to be humble.

1474
01:40:35,303 --> 01:40:37,868
You have to beg him to.
I'll do it.

1475
01:40:38,671 --> 01:40:41,571
I'm gonna beg the Holy Spirit
to come into me.

1476
01:40:41,707 --> 01:40:44,710
I'm gonna draw the Spirit
in with my breath.

1477
01:40:46,277 --> 01:40:48,814
Spirit, come into me!

1478
01:40:48,950 --> 01:40:50,611
Please, Holy Spirit!

1479
01:40:50,746 --> 01:40:53,150
I'm begging you,
sweet Holy Father,

1480
01:40:53,285 --> 01:40:55,356
for the sake of my friend Sammy.

1481
01:40:55,492 --> 01:40:56,580
Sam.

1482
01:40:56,716 --> 01:40:58,185
Come into us, Jesus!

1483
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,154
Hear our prayer!

1484
01:41:00,289 --> 01:41:01,757
Open your mouth.

1485
01:41:01,893 --> 01:41:05,359
Open your mouth and take
the spirit of Christ into you.

1486
01:41:33,022 --> 01:41:35,096
MONICA'S MOTHER:
Monica, Sammy, I made snacks.

1487
01:41:35,231 --> 01:41:37,194
We're coming!

1488
01:41:37,330 --> 01:41:38,925
- Oh...
- Tomorrow after school,

1489
01:41:39,061 --> 01:41:40,899
want to meet out back
behind the bleachers?

1490
01:41:41,035 --> 01:41:42,363
- Yeah.
- Cool.

1491
01:41:42,498 --> 01:41:44,634
We can pray some more.

1492
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:57,416
When I was a girl
and I felt sad,

1493
01:41:57,552 --> 01:42:00,119
I'd go to the zoo
and I'd watch the monkeys.

1494
01:42:00,254 --> 01:42:01,856
MONICA:
They made you laugh?

1495
01:42:01,992 --> 01:42:04,225
Yeah, yeah, the monkeyshines.

1496
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,254
Oh, but there was
more to it than that.

1497
01:42:06,389 --> 01:42:08,260
It was...

1498
01:42:08,396 --> 01:42:10,295
They understand
what we've done to them,

1499
01:42:10,431 --> 01:42:12,260
with the cages
and the people pointing.

1500
01:42:12,396 --> 01:42:14,068
We share that with them,

1501
01:42:14,204 --> 01:42:16,335
the truth of
how cruel people are.

1502
01:42:16,471 --> 01:42:17,999
But if you watch them
for long enough,

1503
01:42:18,135 --> 01:42:20,905
you can tell they know stuff
we can't begin to imagine.

1504
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,736
Important stuff.

1505
01:42:22,872 --> 01:42:24,911
And they're not gonna
let us in on it

1506
01:42:25,047 --> 01:42:26,871
'cause it belongs to them.

1507
01:42:27,006 --> 01:42:28,542
It's their own monkey business.

1508
01:42:28,678 --> 01:42:31,312
Theirs. It's not ours. It's...

1509
01:42:32,987 --> 01:42:34,952
Oh, I don't know.

1510
01:42:35,087 --> 01:42:36,722
Self-possession.

1511
01:42:36,857 --> 01:42:38,754
Right.

1512
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:42,323
They belong to themselves.

1513
01:42:42,459 --> 01:42:44,627
If it belongs to itself,

1514
01:42:44,762 --> 01:42:46,859
let it go back
to where it came from.

1515
01:42:46,995 --> 01:42:49,197
Anyway, that's how come
I got a monkey.

1516
01:42:49,332 --> 01:42:51,134
And a therapist.

1517
01:42:51,270 --> 01:42:53,005
He throws his poop.

1518
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:54,807
The therapist?

1519
01:42:54,942 --> 01:42:56,066
No, the monkey.

1520
01:42:56,202 --> 01:42:57,574
That's why I'm staying
in a hotel.

1521
01:42:57,710 --> 01:42:59,947
You don't have to.
We have plenty of room.

1522
01:43:00,082 --> 01:43:01,842
My rabbi in New Jersey says

1523
01:43:01,977 --> 01:43:04,383
a monkey in the house
isn't kosher.

1524
01:43:04,519 --> 01:43:05,999
That's why we're not
going to eat him.

1525
01:43:06,048 --> 01:43:07,728
Did you schedule him
for his polio vaccine?

1526
01:43:07,788 --> 01:43:09,569
- MONICA: They can get polio?
- MITZI: Pass the peas.

1527
01:43:09,593 --> 01:43:11,063
BURT: Well, they're susceptible
to pretty much everything

1528
01:43:11,087 --> 01:43:13,092
- humans are, so yes.
- He hates going to the vet.

1529
01:43:13,227 --> 01:43:14,592
You see, Monica, in this family,

1530
01:43:14,727 --> 01:43:16,896
it's the scientists
versus the artists.

1531
01:43:17,032 --> 01:43:18,332
Sammy's on my team.

1532
01:43:18,467 --> 01:43:20,457
Takes after me,
except he's got real talent.

1533
01:43:20,593 --> 01:43:21,665
Mom.

1534
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,360
And he's completely terrible
at science.

1535
01:43:23,384 --> 01:43:24,595
Mm. And algebra.

1536
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:25,867
And sports.

1537
01:43:26,003 --> 01:43:28,275
- Will you please stop?
- He showed me his camera.

1538
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:30,375
Is he good at kissing?

1539
01:43:30,511 --> 01:43:31,941
- I'll tell you later.
- Shut up!

1540
01:43:32,076 --> 01:43:34,380
- He sleeps with a camera under his pillow.
- No, I don't.

1541
01:43:34,516 --> 01:43:36,156
But he refuses
to actually shoot anything.

1542
01:43:36,285 --> 01:43:38,079
He should shoot Ditch Day.

1543
01:43:38,126 --> 01:43:40,366
- SAMMY: Mm. Mm-mm.
- They still don't have a photographer.

1544
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:42,030
- You could volunteer.
- What's Ditch Day?

1545
01:43:42,054 --> 01:43:43,504
It doesn't matter.
I'm not going.

1546
01:43:43,559 --> 01:43:44,964
Something seniors get to do
at the end of the year.

1547
01:43:44,988 --> 01:43:46,828
They let us pretend like
we're ditching school,

1548
01:43:46,852 --> 01:43:48,919
and we all take buses
to Santa Cruz Main Beach.

1549
01:43:49,055 --> 01:43:50,525
You have to go! Everyone goes.

1550
01:43:50,660 --> 01:43:52,360
My dad will lend you his camera.

1551
01:43:52,495 --> 01:43:53,693
It's super fancy.

1552
01:43:53,829 --> 01:43:55,502
Costs like a thousand dollars.

1553
01:43:55,638 --> 01:43:58,303
It's called, like, a...
an "Air" something. I forget.

1554
01:43:58,438 --> 01:43:59,868
- Wait, not an Arriflex.
- Right.

1555
01:44:00,003 --> 01:44:03,236
Your dad owns
a 16 millimeter Arriflex?

1556
01:44:04,139 --> 01:44:05,943
Wow. Wow, okay.
So, 16 millimeter on stock...

1557
01:44:06,078 --> 01:44:07,990
See, usually it's the teacher
who shoots the Ditch Day movie,

1558
01:44:08,014 --> 01:44:09,858
- and it's a big joke.
- That's two minutes, 45 seconds a roll.

1559
01:44:09,882 --> 01:44:11,697
At ten bucks a roll,
for a whole day, that would be,

1560
01:44:11,721 --> 01:44:13,058
- like, insanely expensive.
- I owe you a graduation check.

1561
01:44:13,082 --> 01:44:14,851
My dad will get the school
to pay for it.

1562
01:44:14,987 --> 01:44:16,987
And I need to rent a
16 millimeter editing machine,

1563
01:44:17,011 --> 01:44:18,558
and I have no idea
how much that costs,

1564
01:44:18,694 --> 01:44:20,934
- so it's not gonna work.
- My dad will rent one for you.

1565
01:44:20,958 --> 01:44:23,007
Uh, we can rent it,
whatever it costs, right?

1566
01:44:23,062 --> 01:44:24,959
Burt.

1567
01:44:26,598 --> 01:44:28,798
Uh, what's wrong
with your Bolex?

1568
01:44:28,934 --> 01:44:30,870
You could afford to be
a little encouraging.

1569
01:44:31,005 --> 01:44:32,468
About what?

1570
01:44:32,604 --> 01:44:34,265
About him making movies again.

1571
01:44:34,400 --> 01:44:36,120
Well, I didn't say that.
I'm just talking...

1572
01:44:36,144 --> 01:44:38,072
- Maybe he's moved on.
- On from what?

1573
01:44:38,208 --> 01:44:40,446
He hasn't picked up his camera
once since we got here.

1574
01:44:40,582 --> 01:44:42,182
He'll be going to college
this September.

1575
01:44:42,206 --> 01:44:43,813
Maybe his feelings about it
have changed.

1576
01:44:43,948 --> 01:44:46,448
He's growing up.
I'm enthusiastic about that.

1577
01:44:46,584 --> 01:44:48,017
Filming is what he loves.

1578
01:44:48,152 --> 01:44:49,897
- I don't think him...
- Oh, Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.

1579
01:44:49,921 --> 01:44:51,761
Guys, can we please just
stop talking about me?

1580
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:53,330
I'd think that you,
more than anyone,

1581
01:44:53,430 --> 01:44:54,703
should have some
understanding of what a...

1582
01:44:54,727 --> 01:44:56,127
Let's go to your place
or something.

1583
01:44:56,151 --> 01:44:57,829
Maybe your dad
can show me the camera.

1584
01:44:57,965 --> 01:44:59,574
- ...a vocation, a-a calling is.
- BURT: All right. All right.

1585
01:44:59,598 --> 01:45:00,901
We'll rent him the equipment.

1586
01:45:01,037 --> 01:45:02,195
He hates the beach.

1587
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:04,130
That's why he doesn't want
to go to Ditch Day.

1588
01:45:04,154 --> 01:45:05,262
But it's not your calling.

1589
01:45:05,398 --> 01:45:07,407
Is that why you can't, uh,
respect it?

1590
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:08,903
BURT:
I have respect for everything

1591
01:45:09,038 --> 01:45:10,777
- he works hard doing.
- He's afraid.

1592
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,791
He's scared if he does, those
guys will beat him up again.

1593
01:45:12,815 --> 01:45:15,096
What? No, I'm not. I never said
that I was scared of them.

1594
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:16,920
- MITZI: You don't, though.
- You got beat up?

1595
01:45:17,014 --> 01:45:18,974
You always dismiss
what he does, what anyone does,

1596
01:45:19,018 --> 01:45:22,583
that's playful or imaginative
as a pastime or a hobby.

1597
01:45:22,718 --> 01:45:24,423
You already won, Mitz.

1598
01:45:24,559 --> 01:45:26,360
I surrendered.
I'm not taking the bait.

1599
01:45:26,496 --> 01:45:28,003
SAMMY: Can you guys please
just cut it out?

1600
01:45:28,027 --> 01:45:29,907
- MITZI: Oh, who's baiting who?
- You're embarrassing me.

1601
01:45:29,931 --> 01:45:31,477
I said I'd take him for his
polio shot the first five times

1602
01:45:31,501 --> 01:45:32,908
- you asked me, didn't I?
- Well, you say you will,

1603
01:45:32,932 --> 01:45:35,029
but I guess you don't mean it,
so I ask again

1604
01:45:35,165 --> 01:45:36,965
- and again and again.
- He's scared of shots.

1605
01:45:36,989 --> 01:45:39,553
He's scared of the doctor.

1606
01:45:40,269 --> 01:45:43,543
I am taking the goddamn monkey
to the vet, okay?

1607
01:45:43,678 --> 01:45:45,198
HADASSAH:
Probably needs a tranquilizer

1608
01:45:45,222 --> 01:45:46,580
with all this yelling.

1609
01:45:46,715 --> 01:45:49,014
Can you ask your dad
about borrowing the camera?

1610
01:45:49,150 --> 01:45:50,444
He'll say yes.

1611
01:45:50,579 --> 01:45:52,415
Thank you.

1612
01:45:52,550 --> 01:45:55,088
I'm filming Ditch Day.

1613
01:45:55,224 --> 01:45:56,886

Your mom misses Phoenix
too much.

1649
01:49:16,523 --> 01:49:17,751
Tell them the truth.

1650
01:49:17,886 --> 01:49:19,754
And I can't leave.

1651
01:49:19,890 --> 01:49:21,721
This is where my work is.

1652
01:49:21,856 --> 01:49:23,063
I have to...

1653
01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:24,631
That's crazy.

1654
01:49:24,767 --> 01:49:27,465
You... you can't ruin everything

1655
01:49:27,601 --> 01:49:29,699
because you miss one place

1656
01:49:29,834 --> 01:49:32,033
and you're stuck someplace else.

1657
01:49:32,168 --> 01:49:34,669
I miss Bennie too much.

1658
01:49:34,804 --> 01:49:36,208
NATALIE:
So?

1659
01:49:36,343 --> 01:49:38,076
We all miss him.

1660
01:49:38,879 --> 01:49:41,238
This is a different kind
of missing.

1661
01:49:41,374 --> 01:49:43,013
NATALIE:
Because what?

1662
01:49:43,812 --> 01:49:45,543
You love Bennie?

1663
01:49:45,678 --> 01:49:47,120
Don't you love Daddy?

1664
01:49:47,256 --> 01:49:48,256
Sure she does.

1665
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:50,185
- Of course I love Dad.
- And I love Mom.

1666
01:49:50,321 --> 01:49:52,521
Then why is this
all of a sudden happening?!

1667
01:49:52,657 --> 01:49:54,354
Stay together.

1668
01:49:54,489 --> 01:49:57,296
You love each other,
and you love us,

1669
01:49:57,432 --> 01:49:58,831
and we don't want this.

1670
01:49:58,966 --> 01:50:01,027
We don't want to have to move
back and forth

1671
01:50:01,163 --> 01:50:02,565
and not live with both of you.

1672
01:50:02,701 --> 01:50:04,338
We can't. Dad, we can't.

1673
01:50:04,474 --> 01:50:05,871
You're always so mean to him!

1674
01:50:06,006 --> 01:50:07,768
That's why
you're getting divorced!

1675
01:50:07,904 --> 01:50:09,675
It's because of you!

1676
01:50:09,811 --> 01:50:11,072
Don't blame your mom.

1677
01:50:11,208 --> 01:50:13,109
This wasn't her idea.
It was mine.

1678
01:50:13,244 --> 01:50:16,114
- Don't-don't say that.
- NATALIE: No, it wasn't.

1679
01:50:16,250 --> 01:50:18,746
She just said it was because
of Bennie, so stop lying!

1680
01:50:18,882 --> 01:50:20,985
Both of you, stop lying!

1681
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:23,118
I'm giving your mom a chance

1682
01:50:23,253 --> 01:50:27,820

to your beach blanket movie
after that.

1690
01:50:58,659 --> 01:51:01,058
We're different, I guess.

1691
01:51:17,011 --> 01:51:19,307
Is she gonna marry Bennie?

1692
01:51:20,142 --> 01:51:22,277
If she wants to, she will.

1693
01:51:24,019 --> 01:51:26,248
God, she's the most selfish
person in the world.

1694
01:51:26,383 --> 01:51:29,486
It must've been hard for her,
married to a

1695
01:51:29,621 --> 01:51:31,489
a genius.

1696
01:51:31,624 --> 01:51:33,456
Dad worships Mom.

1697
01:51:33,591 --> 01:51:35,062
Okay.

1698
01:51:35,998 --> 01:51:39,865
But maybe it's hard
being worshipped by someone

1699
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:41,865
you know you'll never
be as good as

1700
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,071
or ever do anything as good as.

1701
01:51:44,206 --> 01:51:45,498
She...

1702
01:51:46,642 --> 01:51:49,007
She laughs at Bennie's jokes,

1703
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:53,574
but Dad's always
been her best audience.

1704
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:55,611
Come on.

1705
01:51:55,746 --> 01:51:57,512
She'll be fine.

1706
01:51:57,647 --> 01:52:00,447
She'll tell herself everything
happens for a reason.

1707
01:52:00,582 --> 01:52:02,821
She'll make excuses
like she always does.

1708
01:52:02,956 --> 01:52:04,818
You're way more selfish
than her.

1709
01:52:06,728 --> 01:52:08,659
That's why you're angry at her.

1710
01:52:08,795 --> 01:52:11,596
It's because she's scared,

1711
01:52:11,731 --> 01:52:13,933
just like you, Sammy.

02:03:10,555 --> 02:03:13,450
I want to know why you did that.

1891
02:03:13,585 --> 02:03:15,458
I don't know. I ought to have
my head examined.

1892
02:03:15,594 --> 02:03:16,791
Am I supposed to feel bad now

1893
02:03:16,926 --> 02:03:18,430
about all that shit
we did to you?

1894
02:03:18,566 --> 02:03:19,840
Do you feel bad
about all that shit?

1895
02:03:19,864 --> 02:03:21,304
That's none of
your goddamn business!

1896
02:03:21,362 --> 02:03:23,242
- 'Cause you should feel bad about...
- Oh, right!

1897
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:25,700
That's why you did it. You want
me to feel like crap about...

1898
02:03:25,724 --> 02:03:27,604
I wanted you to be nice to me
for five minutes!

1899
02:03:27,740 --> 02:03:29,899
Or I did it
to make my movie better.

1900
02:03:30,034 --> 02:03:31,237
I don't know why.

1901
02:03:31,372 --> 02:03:34,976
You are the biggest jerk
I've ever met in my entire life.

1902
02:03:35,112 --> 02:03:38,482
I have a monkey at home
that's smarter than you!

1903
02:03:38,617 --> 02:03:42,619
You dumb, anti-Semitic asshole!

1904
02:03:42,755 --> 02:03:45,184
I made you look like
you could fly.

1905
02:03:46,192 --> 02:03:47,758
But I can't fly.

1906
02:03:47,893 --> 02:03:49,956
I can outrun any guy
in Santa Clara County,

1907
02:03:50,092 --> 02:03:51,831
and I worked real hard
to do that.

1908
02:03:51,966 --> 02:03:54,533
But you... you make me feel
like I'm some kind of failure

1909
02:03:54,669 --> 02:03:56,735
or a phony or...
or like I'm supposed to be

1910
02:03:56,871 --> 02:03:59,471
some guy I'm never gonna be,
not even in my dreams.

1911
02:03:59,607 --> 02:04:00,937
You took that guy,
whoever he is,

1912
02:04:01,072 --> 02:04:03,072
wherever you got him from,
and you put him up there

1913
02:04:03,096 --> 02:04:04,967
on that screen
and told everyone

1914
02:04:05,103 --> 02:04:06,412
everyone that that's me.

1915
02:04:06,548 --> 02:04:08,641
And that's not me.
That's... It's...

1916
02:04:10,617 --> 02:04:14,147
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.

1917
02:04:17,649 --> 02:04:19,592
Jesus, it wasn't supposed
to make you upset.

1918
02:04:19,728 --> 02:04:21,622
I didn't mean to freak you out.
I didn't mean...

1919
02:04:21,758 --> 02:04:24,564
Who cares what you meant?

1920
02:04:25,660 --> 02:04:27,831
Fabelman!

1921
02:04:29,268 --> 02:04:30,500
Oh, shit.

1922
02:04:30,635 --> 02:04:31,915
You liar! You backstabbing liar!

1923
02:04:31,939 --> 02:04:34,046
I'm gonna beat your...

1924
02:04:45,852 --> 02:04:47,714
You totally bought it,
his whole snow job.

1925
02:04:47,850 --> 02:04:50,017
You ate it up. You moron.

1926
02:04:50,153 --> 02:04:52,823
Logan, you are so conceited
and dumb.

1927
02:05:18,112 --> 02:05:20,785
Is something about to happen?

1928
02:05:21,822 --> 02:05:23,621
You like living dangerously,
Fabelman.

1929
02:05:23,757 --> 02:05:25,420
No, I don't.
I really, really don't.

1930
02:05:25,555 --> 02:05:27,055
Yes, you do.

1931
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:30,990
But you tell anybody
about me getting, um

1932
02:05:31,125 --> 02:05:34,799
upset, that would be a mistake.

1933
02:05:37,061 --> 02:05:38,432
Our secret.

1934
02:05:38,567 --> 02:05:40,105
Okay?

1935
02:05:40,240 --> 02:05:42,037
Definitely.

1936
02:05:45,612 --> 02:05:47,911
Unless I make a movie about it.

1937
02:05:49,044 --> 02:05:51,750
Which I'm never ever gonna do.

1938
02:06:17,277 --> 02:06:19,206
You never...

1939
02:06:20,379 --> 02:06:22,209
What's it like?

1940
02:06:23,984 --> 02:06:27,148
It kind of shows you how
out of control everything is

1941
02:06:27,283 --> 02:06:31,856
and how y-you're not
in charge of anything.

1942
02:06:34,385 --> 02:06:36,458
A-And how it doesn't matter.

1943
02:06:36,594 --> 02:06:38,326
I better not.

1944
02:06:39,296 --> 02:06:42,196
In my head, everything's
already out of control.

1945
02:06:44,629 --> 02:06:46,672
You're full of shit.

1946
02:06:46,808 --> 02:06:49,676
I got to split.
Claudia's waiting for me.

1947
02:06:54,882 --> 02:06:58,350
Life's nothing like the movies,
Fabelman.

1948
02:06:58,486 --> 02:06:59,714
SAMMY:
Maybe not.

1949
02:06:59,849 --> 02:07:02,287
But hey, in the end

1950
02:07:02,422 --> 02:07:04,691
you got the girl.

1951
02:07:27,581 --> 02:07:30,442
Must have been some night.

1952
02:07:32,982 --> 02:07:35,280
Did Monica like the corsage?

1953
02:07:35,416 --> 02:07:38,791
- Yeah.
- Well, I told you she would.

1954
02:07:46,732 --> 02:07:48,828
That time when I hit you...

1955
02:07:48,964 --> 02:07:51,801
In-in Phoenix, when I...

1956
02:07:51,936 --> 02:07:54,406
Oh, God. You remember.

1957
02:07:56,004 --> 02:07:57,973
SAMMY:
Not really.

1958
02:07:58,109 --> 02:07:59,876
Oh, for the love of God,
it's not like

1959
02:08:00,012 --> 02:08:02,348
I spent my whole life
hitting you.

1960
02:08:02,483 --> 02:08:04,978
Once. I hit you once.

1961
02:08:05,113 --> 02:08:06,583
It should've been memorable.

1962
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:08,080
Before the swimming test.

1963
02:08:08,216 --> 02:08:10,113
Yes, before the swimming test!

1964
02:08:10,248 --> 02:08:12,415
Yes. Well, I-I...

1965
02:08:12,550 --> 02:08:15,928
I s-slapped you on your back

1966
02:08:17,064 --> 02:08:19,127
as hard as I could.
I screwed up your tryouts,

1967
02:08:19,263 --> 02:08:20,964
and you-you couldn't get
your merit badge,

1968
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:22,620
and then you couldn't make
Eagle Scout.

1969
02:08:22,644 --> 02:08:24,044
- Ma, I made Eagle Scout.
- And I...

1970
02:08:24,171 --> 02:08:26,251
- It wasn't a big deal.
- Well, I left a goddamn mark

1971
02:08:26,275 --> 02:08:29,013
on your skin
in the sh-shape of my hand.

1972
02:08:29,077 --> 02:08:31,306
And I need you to say
you forgive me for doing that.

1973
02:08:31,441 --> 02:08:35,012
- Well, okay. I forgive you.
- Because... Because...

1974
02:08:36,247 --> 02:08:38,114
- Because you're my kid.
- Mom, I forgive you.

1975
02:08:38,249 --> 02:08:40,117
And-and-and my kids
mean more to me than...

1976
02:08:40,252 --> 02:08:42,372
- Mom, I forgive you.
- ...anything else on the Earth.

1977
02:08:42,396 --> 02:08:43,894
- I forgive you.
- -Because...

1978
02:08:43,950 --> 02:08:46,270
Please, please. Because how
am I ever gonna forgive myself?

1979
02:08:46,294 --> 02:08:48,524
- I can't.
- Mom, I-I-I...

1980
02:08:48,660 --> 02:08:49,989
I forgive you.

1981
02:08:50,124 --> 02:08:51,924
The eggs are burning.

1982
02:08:52,059 --> 02:08:54,563
MITZI:
Oh, God.

1983
02:08:54,698 --> 02:08:57,133
♪ ♪

1984
02:08:58,937 --> 02:09:01,973
I'm doing this thing.

1985
02:09:02,943 --> 02:09:05,306
And I-I don't know
if it's the right thing,

1986
02:09:05,441 --> 02:09:07,944
but it's a life-and-death
thing for me.

1987
02:09:08,080 --> 02:09:10,408
And I'm sorry,
but everybody else

1988
02:09:10,544 --> 02:09:12,746
is gonna have to hang on
for dear life.

1989
02:09:12,881 --> 02:09:14,850
And somehow,

1990
02:09:14,985 --> 02:09:18,419
we will survive this, all of us.

1991
02:09:18,554 --> 02:09:21,522
Even your father,
who I adore with all my heart.

1992
02:09:21,658 --> 02:09:25,832
He deserves so much better
than what I'm doing, but...

1993
02:09:28,868 --> 02:09:31,501
...but Bennie needs me, dolly.

1994
02:09:31,636 --> 02:09:33,671
And I need him.

1995
02:09:33,806 --> 02:09:35,169
So much so that without him,

1996
02:09:35,305 --> 02:09:37,072
I'm turning into someone
I don't know

1997
02:09:37,208 --> 02:09:40,106
and none of you
will know me anymore.

1998
02:09:40,241 --> 02:09:42,013
I'll just be that hateful person

1999
02:09:42,148 --> 02:09:44,006
who did that terrible thing
to your back.

2000
02:09:44,142 --> 02:09:48,218
And yes, this is the most
selfish thing I have ever done,

2001
02:09:48,353 --> 02:09:52,188
but I've got to do this now
because, Sammy

2002
02:09:53,457 --> 02:09:56,356
you do what your heart
says you have to,

2003
02:09:56,492 --> 02:09:59,492
'cause you don't owe anyone
your life.

2004
02:10:00,731 --> 02:10:02,565
Not even me.

2005
02:10:08,840 --> 02:10:10,773
Oh... Are they ruined?

2006
02:10:10,909 --> 02:10:13,745
I-I-I can make some more.

2007
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:15,447
Oh, no, no, no.

2008
02:10:15,582 --> 02:10:17,279
I like 'em burnt.

2009
02:10:21,182 --> 02:10:23,221
So, Monica dumped me.

2010
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:25,023
She did?

2011
02:10:25,158 --> 02:10:27,894
Yeah, after I told her
about the divorce.

2012
02:10:28,725 --> 02:10:30,293
Huh?

2013
02:10:31,230 --> 02:10:33,699
Probably shouldn't have
asked her to marry me.

2014
02:10:33,834 --> 02:10:35,833
- You did not.
- Oh, but...

2015
02:10:35,968 --> 02:10:38,498
Oh. You did?

2016
02:10:39,601 --> 02:10:43,140
- In so many words.
- Poor girl.

2017
02:11:04,497 --> 02:11:05,761
Dad?

2018
02:11:09,670 --> 02:11:11,905
Hey, Dad, I'm home.

2019
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:24,746
BURT:
Sammy?

2020
02:11:30,617 --> 02:11:32,926
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

2021
02:11:38,593 --> 02:11:40,667
Come here.

2022
02:11:49,308 --> 02:11:51,177
It's a panic attack.
Your mother gets them.

2023
02:11:51,313 --> 02:11:53,708
- What did you do when she'd get them?
- I made her tea.

2024
02:11:53,843 --> 02:11:55,241
Okay.

2025
02:12:01,249 --> 02:12:03,983
Plus, you're exhausted.

2026
02:12:04,118 --> 02:12:05,991
You don't sleep.

2027
02:12:06,126 --> 02:12:07,856
I hear you walking around
all night

2028
02:12:07,992 --> 02:12:09,226
or typing those letters,

2029
02:12:09,361 --> 02:12:10,961
and the three hours' drive
to the college

2030
02:12:11,055 --> 02:12:12,895
- every day and back, it's...
- Oh, no, no, no.

2031
02:12:12,933 --> 02:12:14,361
I can't go back to that dorm.

2032
02:12:14,497 --> 02:12:15,996
Maybe your roommate
settled down.

2033
02:12:16,132 --> 02:12:17,568
He voted for Goldwater.

2034
02:12:17,703 --> 02:12:19,569
I can't go back.

2035
02:12:19,704 --> 02:12:20,935
Dad...

2036
02:12:23,973 --> 02:12:26,039
I don't know

2037
02:12:26,175 --> 02:12:28,344
what to do anymore.

2038
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:31,115
I don't want to disappoint you,

2039
02:12:31,250 --> 02:12:34,417
and I promised
that I'd stick it out,

2040
02:12:34,552 --> 02:12:37,253
but two years is like forever,
and I hate school.

2041
02:12:37,388 --> 02:12:39,487
Like, a lot.

2042
02:12:39,622 --> 02:12:44,290
And I want to get work
on a movie or a TV show,

2043
02:12:44,425 --> 02:12:46,193
so I send out all those letters,

2044
02:12:46,328 --> 02:12:48,198
but nobody ever writes back.

2045
02:12:48,334 --> 02:12:50,703
And my life is just
going by so fast,

2046
02:12:50,839 --> 02:12:52,936
but it's not getting anywhere.

2047
02:12:55,440 --> 02:12:58,275
Concentrate on sipping.
It'll calm you down.

2048
02:13:03,617 --> 02:13:05,715
Here. Uh...

2049
02:13:08,423 --> 02:13:11,354
You can go through the mail
while I get the soup hot.

2050
02:13:33,111 --> 02:13:35,444
SAMMY:
It's from Mom.

2051
02:13:36,479 --> 02:13:38,344
It's just a bunch
of goofy photos

2052
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:40,317
from some kind of block party.

2053
02:14:26,732 --> 02:14:28,530
Dad?

2054
02:14:30,771 --> 02:14:32,534
Dad, what's...

2055
02:14:42,048 --> 02:14:43,973
Oh, Dad, I didn't mean to...

2056
02:14:44,109 --> 02:14:46,680
If you hate school so much,
don't go.

2057
02:14:47,778 --> 02:14:49,516
But... Dad, we need...

2058
02:14:49,652 --> 02:14:51,223
I don't know.
I would like you to

2059
02:14:51,358 --> 02:14:53,259
because this film thing...
I don't know.

2060
02:14:53,394 --> 02:14:55,518
Maybe I should have
put my foot down about it

2061
02:14:55,653 --> 02:14:58,329
years ago, but...

2062
02:14:59,860 --> 02:15:03,132
I know you're gonna work
like the dickens

2063
02:15:03,268 --> 02:15:04,863
on whatever you wind up doing

2064
02:15:04,998 --> 02:15:08,174
because you're a chip
off the old block.

2065
02:15:12,842 --> 02:15:16,413
We're never not going to know
each other, Sammy.

2066
02:15:19,810 --> 02:15:22,249
How do you know that?

2067
02:15:22,385 --> 02:15:24,084
You and Mom don't anymore.

2068
02:15:24,219 --> 02:15:26,324
Yes, we do.

2069
02:15:27,255 --> 02:15:29,426
We always will.

2070
02:15:30,326 --> 02:15:32,792
I know it because

2071
02:15:34,598 --> 02:15:36,802
we've gone too far
in our story

2072
02:15:36,938 --> 02:15:40,173
to actually say "the end."

2073
02:15:49,514 --> 02:15:51,943
Uh, you missed something
in the mail.

2074
02:16:18,779 --> 02:16:20,609
Good news?

2075
02:16:23,417 --> 02:16:25,615
BERNIE FEIN:
<i>They've ordered 32 half hours,</i>

2076
02:16:25,750 --> 02:16:29,111
Fridays at 8:30 p.m. on CBS,
starting September 17th.

2077
02:16:29,247 --> 02:16:30,818
We already have six shows
in the can.

2078
02:16:30,953 --> 02:16:33,224
It's like<i> Stalag 17</i>
or<i> The Great Escape,</i>

2079
02:16:33,360 --> 02:16:34,958
- except it's funnier.
- SAMMY: Mm.

2080
02:16:35,094 --> 02:16:36,359
And it's for television.

2081
02:16:36,495 --> 02:16:37,791
- And it's funny.
- Yeah.

2082
02:16:37,926 --> 02:16:39,660
Or at least I pray to God
that it's funny.

2083
02:16:39,796 --> 02:16:41,426
<i>Hogan's Heroes...</i>
That's the title.

2084
02:16:41,561 --> 02:16:42,894
What do you think?

2085
02:16:43,029 --> 02:16:45,233
- Pretty catchy, right?
- Catchy. Yeah.

2086
02:16:45,368 --> 02:16:46,966
And if all goes well,

2087
02:16:47,102 --> 02:16:51,676
I might be able to offer you
something next season.

2088
02:16:52,479 --> 02:16:55,512
Maybe assisting an assistant
to an assistant.

2089
02:17:00,453 --> 02:17:02,218
You don't want to be
in TV anyway.

2090
02:17:02,354 --> 02:17:05,420
Um, your letter said as much.

2091
02:17:05,555 --> 02:17:07,722
By the way, I love this letter.

2092
02:17:07,857 --> 02:17:09,623
- Oh.
- I used to write a whole bunch

2093
02:17:09,759 --> 02:17:11,394
of these letters
when I was your age.

2094
02:17:11,530 --> 02:17:13,932
You want to make movies.
Am I right?

2095
02:17:14,067 --> 02:17:15,498
Well, yeah. Yes, I do.

2096
02:17:15,634 --> 02:17:17,862
But look, I'm just happy
to start anywhere,

2097
02:17:17,998 --> 02:17:19,631
and-and that doesn't...

2098
02:17:19,767 --> 02:17:21,506
You know who you need to meet?

2099
02:17:21,641 --> 02:17:24,305
I mean, not for a job,
'cause he doesn't do that.

2100
02:17:24,441 --> 02:17:26,311
How would you like to meet

2101
02:17:26,447 --> 02:17:29,312
the greatest film director
who ever lived?

2102
02:17:29,447 --> 02:17:31,911
And he's right across the hall.

2103
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:35,684
Come on.

2104
02:17:40,489 --> 02:17:42,427
Wait here a minute.

2105
02:17:51,532 --> 02:17:53,533
Um, this is Nona.

2106
02:17:53,668 --> 02:17:55,303
Nona's gonna look after you.

2107
02:17:55,439 --> 02:17:56,669
Um, he's not here. He's...

2108
02:17:56,804 --> 02:17:58,102
- NONA: He's at lunch.
- Right.

2109
02:17:58,238 --> 02:18:00,205
- You want to wait?
- BERNIE: Yeah, he'll wait.

2110
02:18:00,341 --> 02:18:02,073
Sit.

2111
02:18:03,180 --> 02:18:04,878
Good luck.

2112
02:18:10,319 --> 02:18:11,922
Could be hours.

2113
02:18:36,411 --> 02:18:38,648
♪ ♪

2114
02:18:55,199 --> 02:18:57,436
♪ ♪

2115
02:19:40,778 --> 02:19:43,608
All right, kid,
you got five minutes.

2116
02:19:43,744 --> 02:19:45,979
Probably one. Stand up.

2117
02:19:49,486 --> 02:19:51,354
Hey. L-Lose the tie.

2118
02:19:51,490 --> 02:19:53,723
You'll stand a better chance.

2119
02:21:03,291 --> 02:21:06,158
They tell me you want to be
a picture maker.

2120
02:21:07,498 --> 02:21:09,460
Um, yes, sir, I do.

2121
02:21:09,596 --> 02:21:11,403
Why?

2122
02:21:11,539 --> 02:21:13,963
This business,
it'll rip you apart.

2123
02:21:14,099 --> 02:21:16,641
W-Well...

2124
02:21:18,035 --> 02:21:19,070
Mr. Ford, I...

2125
02:21:19,206 --> 02:21:21,514
So, what do you know
about art, kid?

2126
02:21:23,846 --> 02:21:25,410
I-I love your movies so much.

2127
02:21:25,546 --> 02:21:27,417
No. Art.

2128
02:21:27,553 --> 02:21:30,050
See that painting over there?

2129
02:21:32,226 --> 02:21:34,092
Uh, yeah. I mean yes.

2130
02:21:34,227 --> 02:21:35,554
Yes, I do see it.

2131
02:21:35,689 --> 02:21:37,596
Walk over to it.

2132
02:21:43,469 --> 02:21:46,301
Well, what's in it? Describe it.

2133
02:21:46,436 --> 02:21:48,172
Oh, okay. Um...

2134
02:21:48,308 --> 02:21:50,175
So, there are two guys,

2135
02:21:50,311 --> 02:21:52,411
and they're on horseback,

2136
02:21:52,546 --> 02:21:54,169
and they're looking
for something.

2137
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:55,424
So maybe they're scouting...

2138
02:21:55,543 --> 02:21:57,544
No. No.

2139
02:21:57,680 --> 02:21:59,545
Where's the horizon?

2140
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,752
The-the horizon?

2141
02:22:01,887 --> 02:22:04,253
- Where is it?
- Yeah, it's at the bottom.

2142
02:22:04,389 --> 02:22:05,950
That's right.

2143
02:22:06,085 --> 02:22:08,726
Walk over to this painting.

2144
02:22:14,727 --> 02:22:16,129
Well?

2145
02:22:17,738 --> 02:22:19,694
Right, okay.
So, there are five cowboys.

2146
02:22:19,830 --> 02:22:21,990
- You know, they could be Indian...
- No, no, no, no, no!

2147
02:22:22,014 --> 02:22:23,669
Where's the goddamn horizon?

2148
02:22:23,805 --> 02:22:25,477
Um, it's-it's there.

2149
02:22:25,613 --> 02:22:27,377
- Where?
- At the top of the painting.

2150
02:22:27,513 --> 02:22:29,340
All right, get over here.

2151
02:22:31,549 --> 02:22:33,617
Now, remember this.

2152
02:22:33,753 --> 02:22:36,011
When the horizon's
at the bottom,

2153
02:22:36,146 --> 02:22:37,883
it's interesting.

2154
02:22:38,019 --> 02:22:40,356
When the horizon's at the top,

2155
02:22:40,491 --> 02:22:42,461
it's interesting.

2156
02:22:42,597 --> 02:22:44,525
When the horizon's
in the middle,

2157
02:22:44,661 --> 02:22:47,463
it's boring as shit.

2158
02:22:47,598 --> 02:22:50,328
Now, good luck to you.

2159
02:22:51,231 --> 02:22:53,733
And get the fuck out
of my office!

2160
02:22:53,869 --> 02:22:55,839
Okay.

2161
02:22:59,476 --> 02:23:01,141
Thank you.

2162
02:23:02,149 --> 02:23:04,045
My pleasure.
