00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:42,373
You got a clinic open.

183
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:43,407
That's no good?

184
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:44,941
Does that
make you feel good?

185
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:45,942
Not bad.

186
00:09:45,944 --> 00:09:47,710
Meanwhile, jarmon
sits on his committees

187
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,345
and carves up the land,
the oil, and the taxes.

188
00:09:50,347 --> 00:09:51,446
You ever seen him?

189
00:09:51,448 --> 00:09:52,847
Have you ever
seen him operate?

190
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,849
Marvin...
Yeah.

191
00:09:54,851 --> 00:09:56,650
What's in it for you?

192
00:09:56,652 --> 00:09:58,718
Oh, uh...

193
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,853
An air card,
a phone card,

194
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:02,754
1,000 bucks a week.

195
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:05,056
And that's all?

196
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:06,590
Well...

197
00:10:06,592 --> 00:10:09,759
Marvin wants me
to go into politics.

198
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:12,862
What else is new?

199
00:10:14,465 --> 00:10:16,164
For what office?

200
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,698
Senator.

201
00:10:20,135 --> 00:10:21,767
Well, why not?

202
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:23,769
If he really
put his mind to it.

203
00:10:23,771 --> 00:10:26,605
That means you'd
have to register.

204
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:28,406
He never has,
you know.

205
00:10:28,408 --> 00:10:29,740
Hasn't been any reason.

206
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:31,675
I hope you
keep that a secret.

207
00:10:31,677 --> 00:10:34,711
Unless you
took it seriously.

208
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,180
Look, the point is,

209
00:10:37,182 --> 00:10:39,582
you can go with the
things you believe in.

210
00:10:39,584 --> 00:10:41,951
For openers,
you've got credibility.

211
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:42,952
You've got the name.

212
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,253
What do you mean,
the name?

213
00:10:44,255 --> 00:10:46,154
You're not going to bring
my father into this.

214
00:10:46,156 --> 00:10:47,421
O.K., we won't.

215
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,189
He's got the looks.

216
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:50,423
Right.

217
00:10:50,425 --> 00:10:53,259
And he's got the power.

218
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:55,461
What does that mean?

219
00:10:55,463 --> 00:10:57,529
You know
what that means.

220
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,097
No, I don't.

221
00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:07,704
Well...If you gentlemen
will excuse me,

222
00:11:07,706 --> 00:11:10,440
um, I have to remove
some film from the bathtub

223
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:11,841
before it rots.

224
00:11:22,185 --> 00:11:25,319
You're saying I can
say what I want,

225
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,553
do what I want,

226
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:28,187
go where I please.

227
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:29,621
Hmm?

228
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,322
That's right.

229
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:32,956
Here's
your guarantee.

230
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:37,960
I lose?

231
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,564
That's it.

232
00:11:42,566 --> 00:11:45,700
So what are you
worried about?

233
00:11:45,702 --> 00:11:47,401
You're free, McKay.

234
00:11:47,403 --> 00:11:50,270
You don't have a chance,
so say what you want.

235
00:11:50,272 --> 00:11:52,672
It's just between
you and the public.

236
00:11:52,674 --> 00:11:54,407
The question is...

237
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,176
Whether you can put
your ass on the line.

238
00:11:57,178 --> 00:12:00,845
No. The question is
whether it's worth it.

239
00:12:02,081 --> 00:12:03,180
Well...

240
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:06,782
Thanks for the beer.

241
00:12:06,784 --> 00:12:09,017
But I remember this...

242
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,252
I remember my mom and dad

243
00:12:11,254 --> 00:12:13,954
went through the 1930s
without welfare,

244
00:12:13,956 --> 00:12:16,156
without poverty programs.

245
00:12:16,158 --> 00:12:19,859
Why, none of us kids
even had a social worker.

246
00:12:19,861 --> 00:12:21,694
[Crowd laughs]

247
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,595
How did we do it?

248
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:26,397
Well, ladies, excuse me,

249
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,466
but we worked our butts off.

250
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,303
But I tell you this,
good people,

251
00:12:35,305 --> 00:12:38,906
that Crocker jarmon
still believes

252
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,941
that individuals
are responsible

253
00:12:40,943 --> 00:12:43,043
for themselves.

254
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:46,946
And so does the vast majority
of the American people!

255
00:12:46,948 --> 00:12:49,782
And that's why we're
going to tell big brother

256
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:51,383
to get lost!

257
00:12:51,385 --> 00:12:53,818
[Cheering and whistling]

258
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:57,921
The solution to welfare
is not more welfare.

259
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,757
It's more enterprise,
more industry,

260
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,058
and more jobs.

261
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,860
Now, there are those
who say to industry,

262
00:13:04,862 --> 00:13:06,261
don't build,
don't develop,

263
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:07,862
don't cut
a single tree,

264
00:13:07,864 --> 00:13:10,164
or you'll destroy
our watershed, and so on.

265
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,799
But I know when
the time comes for building,

266
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,068
we will build, because
building means jobs.

267
00:13:17,071 --> 00:13:18,103
And...

268
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:20,205
And...

269
00:13:20,207 --> 00:13:22,941
We'll find a way
to love mother nature

270
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:25,109
and preserve her...

271
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:28,345
Without
going to extremes.

272
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,413
[Applause]

273
00:13:32,417 --> 00:13:34,417
You think I'm mean?

274
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,385
No!
No!

275
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,986
Well, if I am,

276
00:13:37,988 --> 00:13:39,954
I've spent the last
18 years in the senate

277
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:41,322
being a meanie,

278
00:13:41,324 --> 00:13:42,556
and if need be,

279
00:13:42,558 --> 00:13:44,624
I will spend
another 18 years

280
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:48,994
working to keep this country
healthy and growing

281
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:52,564
and booming
into the future!

00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,512
Thanks for coming.

Oh, you did, huh,
you old devil?

285
00:14:11,116 --> 00:14:13,716
I wish I could, but you know,
the old ball and chain.

286
00:14:13,718 --> 00:14:15,117
How are you?

287
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:16,852
Senator,
good to see you.

288
00:14:16,854 --> 00:14:17,886
Harry rich.

289
00:14:17,888 --> 00:14:18,987
Hello, Harry.
How's business?

290
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:19,988
Fine, fine.

291
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,289
Good. Good, good, good.

292
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,089
Senator jarmon,

293
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:23,590
remember our
little toddy?

294
00:14:23,592 --> 00:14:25,024
Well, hello there, toddy.

295
00:14:25,026 --> 00:14:28,060
He's an ugly little cuss.

My--
what's that?

297
00:14:29,463 --> 00:14:30,395
My daddy thinks

298
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:32,764
you should run
for vice president.

299
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:35,533
Get this child
to a violin.

300
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:36,634
Remember me?

301
00:14:36,636 --> 00:14:40,838
Why, sure do, son.
How's the old throwing arm?

302
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,006
Oh, please, please.
I'm a married man.

306
00:14:52,015 --> 00:14:56,083
Today, at 10:00, I filed
the papers to enter my name

307
00:14:56,085 --> 00:14:57,484
in the Democratic primary

308
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:00,854
as a candidate for
the United States senate.

309
00:15:00,856 --> 00:15:02,755
[Telephone rings]

310
00:15:02,757 --> 00:15:03,756
Any questions?

Community legal service.

312
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,324
Why are you doing this?

313
00:15:06,326 --> 00:15:08,793
Because I don't think
the incumbent

314
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,928
is really in touch
with how people live

315
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,095
or what they need.

316
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:13,763
That's what I tried
to do as a lawyer,

317
00:15:13,765 --> 00:15:15,931
and that's what
I hope to go on doing

318
00:15:15,933 --> 00:15:16,998
as a candidate.

319
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,933
How do you feel
about welfare?

320
00:15:18,935 --> 00:15:21,769
We subsidize trains.
We subsidize planes.

321
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,303
Why not
subsidize people?

322
00:15:24,906 --> 00:15:26,705
What about busing?

323
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:27,706
What about it?

you're going.

00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:52,940
I guess...

542
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:55,808
I guess it is
pretty funny.

543
00:24:57,178 --> 00:25:00,546
In fact, when you think
about it, the whole idea

544
00:25:00,548 --> 00:25:02,314
of 2 guys
making decisions

545
00:25:02,316 --> 00:25:03,682
for 20 million people,

546
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:05,050
that's pretty funny.

547
00:25:05,052 --> 00:25:08,620
But, still,
you can't laugh too much

548
00:25:08,622 --> 00:25:11,522
when you think
what's at stake.

549
00:25:11,524 --> 00:25:13,423
The fact is,
in the next few elections,

550
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:15,825
we're going to decide just
what it's going to be like

551
00:25:15,827 --> 00:25:17,426
to live in this country.

552
00:25:17,428 --> 00:25:19,628
O.K., cut.
We got all we need.

553
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:23,264
Whether people
will have more power

554
00:25:23,266 --> 00:25:25,799
to shape their own lives.

555
00:25:30,671 --> 00:25:34,538
Or whether we're going
to lose that power.

556
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,806
I know that anyone
can stand up

557
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:38,440
and say that much.

558
00:25:38,442 --> 00:25:40,108
It's the details
that's hard,

559
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,111
just how you get
people involved.

560
00:25:43,113 --> 00:25:45,980
Our lives are more
and more determined

561
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:48,983
by forces that overwhelm
the individual.

562
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:55,221
I don't know. Maybe...

563
00:25:56,991 --> 00:25:59,458
Maybe these questions
can't be raised

564
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,258
in a political campaign.

565
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:06,661
Maybe people
aren't ready to listen.

566
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:09,596
But I'm going to try,

567
00:26:09,598 --> 00:26:11,965
and I hope that you'll
support that effort

568
00:26:11,967 --> 00:26:14,567
and at least give me
the benefit of the doubt.

569
00:26:14,569 --> 00:26:15,834
Thank you.

570
00:26:23,676 --> 00:26:25,609
Mr. McKay, your speech
was wonderful.

571
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:27,077
I enjoyed
every moment of it.

572
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:28,745
You'll be
a wonderful senator.

573
00:26:28,747 --> 00:26:29,746
Thank you very much.

574
00:26:29,748 --> 00:26:30,747
Mrs. McKay.

575
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:31,748
Yes. Hello.

576
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:32,749
Oh, you're lovely.

577
00:26:32,751 --> 00:26:34,150
Of all the candidates'
wives,

578
00:26:34,152 --> 00:26:35,351
you are the loveliest.

579
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:36,618
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

580
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,153
Thank you. You look
lovely, too. Thank you.

581
00:26:39,155 --> 00:26:40,287
Hello, sir.

582
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:42,222
Mrs. McKay, I really
enjoyed being with you

583
00:26:42,224 --> 00:26:43,189
here this evening.

584
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:45,357
I'm glad you came.
Thank you very much.

585
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,524
It's a thrill
to meet you.

586
00:26:46,526 --> 00:26:47,758
What's the pin?

587
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,159
Oh, this is our laborers
international pin.

588
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:49,993
I'm sorry?

589
00:26:49,995 --> 00:26:51,561
The laborers
international pin.

590
00:26:51,563 --> 00:26:53,229
How do you do,
Mrs. McKay?

591
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:54,029
I love your dress.

592
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,231
Oh, thank you
very much.

593
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,899
Mr. McKay, I've
heard it all before,

594
00:26:57,901 --> 00:26:59,433
but never put
quite like that.

595
00:26:59,435 --> 00:27:00,434
You were great.

596
00:27:00,436 --> 00:27:01,601
Thank you very much.

597
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:02,902
Right. You are.

598
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:04,236
Mr.--I'm sorry.
I can't--

599
00:27:04,238 --> 00:27:05,170
medina.

600
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:06,337
Medina. And you were
with your wife.

601
00:27:06,339 --> 00:27:08,172
I remember that
very well.

602
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:10,541
See, I have a terrific memory.
You didn't know that.

603
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:11,642
Did you enjoy the speech?

604
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:12,643
It was terrific.

605
00:27:12,645 --> 00:27:13,910
Good. Good. Mr. hodely...

606
00:27:13,912 --> 00:27:17,380
<i> As for credibility...</i>

607
00:27:17,382 --> 00:27:19,048
<i> As I understand it,</i>

608
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:22,518
<i> it depends on whether</i>
<i> you mean what you say.</i>

609
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,788
<i> You say you wouldn't</i>
<i> draw the line in Vietnam.</i>

610
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:28,790
<i> Well, then just</i>
<i> where do you propose</i>

611
00:27:28,792 --> 00:27:30,925
<i> to stand up</i>
<i> against the communists,</i>

612
00:27:30,927 --> 00:27:34,995
<i> on the beaches</i>
<i> in Santa Monica?</i>

613
00:27:34,997 --> 00:27:37,063
<i> I...</i>

614
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:39,665
<i> Well, that depends</i>
<i> on the circumstances.</i>

615
00:27:39,667 --> 00:27:41,633
<i> There's no set answer</i>
<i> for that one.</i>

616
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:42,634
<i> Well, hold it.</i>

617
00:27:42,636 --> 00:27:43,801
<i> There's no set answer.</i>

618
00:27:43,803 --> 00:27:44,935
<i> Well, that's honest,</i>
<i> all right,</i>

619
00:27:44,937 --> 00:27:46,136
<i> but that leaves us</i>
<i> nowhere.</i>

620
00:27:46,138 --> 00:27:47,370
<i> But it's not</i>
<i> a serious question.</i>

621
00:27:47,372 --> 00:27:49,538
It's exactly what you're
going to get asked

622
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,006
tomorrow in long beach.

623
00:27:51,008 --> 00:27:52,440
You got an answer
for him, Corey?

624
00:27:52,442 --> 00:27:54,442
Well, he could say,
uh...

625
00:27:54,444 --> 00:27:55,843
Japan or India

626
00:27:55,845 --> 00:27:58,846
or countries with certain
kinds of governments

627
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,281
which legitimately
request our help.

628
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:03,616
You're speech-writing.
This isn't the cow palace,

629
00:28:03,618 --> 00:28:05,718
this is practice
for a local TV interview.

630
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,686
A lot of people
in this state

631
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,621
still expect an invasion
in Pasadena.

632
00:28:09,623 --> 00:28:11,856
Then we'll fight 'em
in the rose bowl.

633
00:28:11,858 --> 00:28:13,123
Frankly, I don't think

634
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:15,125
this is a gag-writer
situation.

635
00:28:15,127 --> 00:28:17,060
Well, I can kill myself,
I suppose.

636
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:18,661
Look, he could refer them

637
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,229
to our foreign policy
position paper.

638
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:21,196
What position paper?

639
00:28:21,198 --> 00:28:22,730
We'll have it written
in 2 weeks.

640
00:28:22,732 --> 00:28:24,264
I'll tell you
what I think--

641
00:28:24,266 --> 00:28:25,064
hold on.

642
00:28:25,066 --> 00:28:27,733
Come on,
what am I here for?

643
00:28:27,735 --> 00:28:29,267
I've got it.
I've got it.

644
00:28:29,269 --> 00:28:30,935
Will you shut up?

645
00:28:31,938 --> 00:28:35,539
McKay says he will not
let them land

646
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,941
on the beaches
of Santa Monica

647
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:41,144
because the parking problem
is bad enough already.

648
00:28:41,146 --> 00:28:43,146
[Laughter]

649
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:44,747
O.K., that's it.

650
00:28:44,749 --> 00:28:46,615
Thank God
for small favors.

651
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:47,816
O.K., that's it.

652
00:28:47,818 --> 00:28:49,617
It never hurts
to toss one off.

653
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:52,152
But does he really
want to say that?

654
00:28:52,154 --> 00:28:53,887
Next question.

655
00:28:53,889 --> 00:28:55,555
Mr. McKay,
what do you think

656
00:28:55,557 --> 00:28:56,622
about
legalized abortion?

657
00:28:56,624 --> 00:28:58,256
Ah, good question.

658
00:28:58,258 --> 00:28:59,323
I'm for it.

659
00:28:59,325 --> 00:29:00,824
I think every woman
should have that right.

660
00:29:00,826 --> 00:29:03,827
Wait a minute, bill.
You can't put it that way.

661
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,095
That's what I think.

662
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:07,696
Well, it's not going
to be understood

663
00:29:07,698 --> 00:29:09,230
without a hell of
a long explanation,

664
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:10,898
so how about this
for the time being?

665
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,567
Uh, just say
it's worth studying.

666
00:29:13,569 --> 00:29:15,569
O.K. I'll think
about it.

667
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:16,903
All right.

668
00:29:16,905 --> 00:29:18,304
Uh, Mr. McKay--bill...

669
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:21,307
We notice your father
hasn't said one word

670
00:29:21,309 --> 00:29:22,975
about your campaign.

671
00:29:22,977 --> 00:29:24,843
Is he sitting it out?

672
00:29:28,048 --> 00:29:30,048
Uh, let's have
that again.

673
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:32,784
Is your father sitting out
your campaign?

674
00:29:32,786 --> 00:29:35,052
I'm running on
my own hook.

675
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:37,521
[Everyone talking at once]

676
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:38,889
Oh, to hell
with it.

677
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:39,890
Where's he going?

678
00:29:39,892 --> 00:29:40,991
That's all for now.

679
00:29:40,993 --> 00:29:42,993
I said
that's all for now.

680
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:45,328
We're going to have to give
a lot more consideration

681
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,262
to his appearance.

682
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:47,663
If that's the way
he's going to be--

683
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:48,864
Lou.

684
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:51,633
We got a stand set up
right over there.

685
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:53,267
Just pull up behind it.

686
00:29:55,738 --> 00:29:57,871
Hey, I don't want to
drive up in this tank.

687
00:29:57,873 --> 00:29:59,405
Stop here.

688
00:29:59,407 --> 00:30:01,740
That's a good idea.
He's going on foot.

689
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:03,274
Come on.

690
00:30:04,744 --> 00:30:06,577
I don't know what good
this is going to do.

691
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:08,879
It's good for him.

692
00:30:20,158 --> 00:30:21,824
Folks, I want you
to meet bill McKay.

693
00:30:21,826 --> 00:30:23,392
He's running for
the United States senate.

694
00:30:23,394 --> 00:30:25,227
Would you like to
step up here, please?

695
00:30:25,229 --> 00:30:26,461
No, no.

696
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:30,031
Hi, red.

697
00:30:30,033 --> 00:30:30,831
Hi.

698
00:30:30,833 --> 00:30:32,599
Can I have a sip?

699
00:30:32,601 --> 00:30:34,434
Do you do this often?

700
00:30:34,436 --> 00:30:36,636
That'd be great if he
were running for alderman.

701
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:38,904
I'm not running
for alderman.

702
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:41,873
Well, then what are
you doing down here?

703
00:30:41,875 --> 00:30:43,274
Like the leaflet says,

704
00:30:43,276 --> 00:30:46,477
I'm here because
I'm running for senator.

705
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,011
I wanted
to come here today

706
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,645
because I used
to spend some time

707
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:51,748
around this place
a few years ago.

708
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:53,282
In those days,
you could swim here.

709
00:30:53,284 --> 00:30:55,617
It was before they
turned this harbor

710
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,352
into a chemistry set.

711
00:30:57,354 --> 00:30:58,286
In those days,

712
00:30:58,288 --> 00:30:59,820
there used to be
a beach right there

713
00:30:59,822 --> 00:31:02,088
where that
parking lot is.

714
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,355
Anyhow, coming out here

715
00:31:03,357 --> 00:31:05,056
used to be something
pretty special.

716
00:31:05,058 --> 00:31:07,091
Today, it wasn't.
It wasn't so special.

717
00:31:07,093 --> 00:31:09,059
You know, I look
around this beach,

718
00:31:09,061 --> 00:31:10,660
and you know
what I see?

719
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:11,661
Freaks.

720
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:12,662
[Cheering]

721
00:31:12,664 --> 00:31:13,929
You know it.

722
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:15,163
I see lost people.

723
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,764
Ha ha. Oh, really?

724
00:31:16,766 --> 00:31:18,599
Maybe I am middle-class,
in a way,

725
00:31:18,601 --> 00:31:20,601
<i> but I didn't</i>
<i> find that out today.</i>

726
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:22,302
<i> I found that out</i>
<i> working with people</i>

727
00:31:22,304 --> 00:31:23,736
<i> who are trying</i>
<i> to make sure</i>

728
00:31:23,738 --> 00:31:25,504
<i> their kids have enough</i>
<i> to eat tomorrow morning.</i>

729
00:31:25,506 --> 00:31:26,505
Hey, this is good.

730
00:31:26,507 --> 00:31:28,306
We can certainly use
the pollution angle.

731
00:31:28,308 --> 00:31:30,274
Yeah. I'll speed it up.
I don't know.

732
00:31:30,276 --> 00:31:32,843
Maybe we can use a line
or two out of context.

733
00:31:32,845 --> 00:31:34,444
Look what he says.

734
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:36,112
[Rewinding]

735
00:31:37,248 --> 00:31:39,248
<i> Instead of building</i>
<i> atomic reactors,</i>

736
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:41,516
<i> you could clean up</i>
<i> every river,</i>

737
00:31:41,518 --> 00:31:43,584
<i> and instead</i>
<i> of drilling for oil...</i>

738
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:44,885
Hey, that's too much.

739
00:31:44,887 --> 00:31:46,319
I got union problems
already.

740
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,187
O.K. How fast
do you need these spots?

741
00:31:48,189 --> 00:31:50,189
June. He's the only name
in the primary,

742
00:31:50,191 --> 00:31:52,724
so we're not going to
waste too much money.

743
00:31:52,726 --> 00:31:55,193
<i> And we can fire</i>
<i> the board of regents.</i>

744
00:31:55,195 --> 00:31:57,161
How can a senator fire
the board of regents?

745
00:31:57,163 --> 00:31:58,162
It's meaningless.

746
00:31:58,164 --> 00:31:59,930
It sounds good.

747
00:31:59,932 --> 00:32:01,064
Anything else?

748
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:02,465
Don't worry.
It'll cut together.

749
00:32:02,467 --> 00:32:04,867
Wait till we get
the stuff at watts. Trust me.

750
00:32:04,869 --> 00:32:07,236
Gentlemen, this way, please.
This way.

751
00:32:07,238 --> 00:32:09,671
We're going to proceed
5 blocks

752
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:11,072
to our watts headquarters.

753
00:32:11,074 --> 00:32:13,507
Question--could jarmon
walk through watts?

754
00:32:13,509 --> 00:32:15,942
Is your father going
to join the campaign?

755
00:32:15,944 --> 00:32:17,176
Pardon me?

756
00:32:17,178 --> 00:32:18,610
Is your father going
to join the campaign?

757
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:19,677
Whether he does
or not,

758
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,078
I can tell you
what's basic

759
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,079
for the ghetto--

760
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,080
it's a scandal.

761
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:24,214
There's no hospital here.

762
00:32:24,216 --> 00:32:25,815
There's no
on-the-job training

763
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:26,849
for medical aides.

764
00:32:26,851 --> 00:32:28,083
They have
no housing program--

765
00:32:28,085 --> 00:32:29,117
excuse me just a sec.

766
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:30,451
They have
no housing program.

767
00:32:30,453 --> 00:32:32,085
They have
no public transportation.

768
00:32:32,087 --> 00:32:33,619
There's
no birth-control centers.

769
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,554
Tell it, bro.

770
00:32:35,556 --> 00:32:36,922
So what else is new?

771
00:32:36,924 --> 00:32:38,690
Gentlemen, there
will be a cookout

772
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:39,924
in the park
at 3 P.M.

773
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:41,091
Hello.

774
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:42,092
Shake hands with me.

775
00:32:42,094 --> 00:32:44,427
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

776
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:45,995
Hey, brother.

777
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:47,096
How ya doin'?

778
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,964
Bill McKay.

779
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:52,833
You the golden wonder
of the west.

780
00:32:52,835 --> 00:32:54,167
I wouldn't
say that.

781
00:32:54,169 --> 00:32:56,536
Well, what do you
think about my dog?

782
00:32:56,538 --> 00:32:59,772
Well, that's--
that's a fine dog.

783
00:32:59,774 --> 00:33:02,341
Gimme five!

784
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:03,141
Huh?

785
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:05,676
Hey, man.
Hey, hey. Five!

786
00:33:05,678 --> 00:33:06,476
That's my man.

787
00:33:06,478 --> 00:33:07,977
But lookee here.
Lookee here.

788
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:09,511
What about my dog?

789
00:33:09,513 --> 00:33:11,112
What do you think
about my dog?

790
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,313
That's a fine dog.

791
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:15,882
Ooh, now,
what have we here?

792
00:33:15,884 --> 00:33:18,451
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

793
00:33:18,453 --> 00:33:19,518
Excuse us.

794
00:33:21,522 --> 00:33:24,489
Why are you so eager
to defeat jarmon?

795
00:33:24,491 --> 00:33:25,289
Because I think

796
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:26,723
the people
should be able

797
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:27,957
to decide
for themselves.

798
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:29,591
Let them make
the comparison.

799
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,859
What does that mean?

800
00:33:31,861 --> 00:33:34,094
Peace and "up yours."

801
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:36,629
Hey, look at that.

802
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,764
You used to play ball,
didn't you, bill?

803
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:39,765
Yeah.

804
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,466
Well, come on.
Shoot a few.

805
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:44,001
No, look, it's just
on the other side.

806
00:33:44,003 --> 00:33:45,802
Come on.
It's a great idea.

807
00:33:45,804 --> 00:33:48,271
Be fast, bill.
Be fast.

808
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,572
Yay!

809
00:33:49,574 --> 00:33:50,606
Come on.

810
00:33:50,608 --> 00:33:53,541
It's a good idea.
<i> Great</i> idea.

811
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:57,677
Get out of here!

812
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:01,546
Come on.

813
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:16,960
Hey, bill,
look at this.

814
00:34:16,962 --> 00:34:18,661
3 calls
from the<i> chronicle.</i>

815
00:34:38,014 --> 00:34:39,613
God said it!

816
00:34:39,615 --> 00:34:41,014
God means it!

817
00:34:41,016 --> 00:34:42,448
Repent of all sins!

818
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:44,850
Walter, here at the McKay
campaign headquarters,

819
00:34:44,852 --> 00:34:47,452
they're celebrating
his victory in the primary.

820
00:34:47,454 --> 00:34:49,454
A winner, like
his famous father.

821
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:50,922
He's assumed
a strong lead

822
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:53,457
over a field of virtually
unknown Democratic candidates

823
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:55,525
in the Democratic
senatorial primary.

824
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:56,325
Mr. McKay...

825
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,926
Your victory
was predicted.

826
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:59,060
Could it have been

827
00:34:59,062 --> 00:35:00,761
any sort
of surprise?

828
00:35:00,763 --> 00:35:01,928
Everything that happens

829
00:35:01,930 --> 00:35:03,296
is a complete surprise
to me.

830
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,997
¶ The power, the glory ¶

831
00:35:04,999 --> 00:35:06,898
¶ as said in the west ¶

832
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,666
¶ the voters
are shouting ¶

833
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:11,068
McKay is the best!

834
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,702
¶ Win with all the... ¶

835
00:35:12,704 --> 00:35:14,937
bill, you got to get
on the horn to Mrs. York.

836
00:35:14,939 --> 00:35:16,204
She won't talk
to anybody but you.

837
00:35:16,206 --> 00:35:17,405
Is she on now?

838
00:35:17,407 --> 00:35:18,205
Yes.

839
00:35:18,207 --> 00:35:19,372
Bill, Natalie wood's here.

840
00:35:19,374 --> 00:35:20,973
We got to get
some pictures.

841
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,074
Oh, really?

842
00:35:22,076 --> 00:35:23,909
Yes. Nancy, come on.

843
00:35:23,911 --> 00:35:28,045
¶ He'll deal with issues
that have weight ¶

844
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:31,314
¶ McKay's the people's
candidate ¶

845
00:35:31,316 --> 00:35:34,984
¶ to the senate,
here we co-o-ome ¶

846
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:36,318
I'd like you
to meet bill McKay.

847
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,819
Hello. How are you?

848
00:35:37,821 --> 00:35:39,420
And Nancy McKay.

849
00:35:39,422 --> 00:35:41,455
This is my wife Nancy.

850
00:35:41,457 --> 00:35:42,622
Hello.

851
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:46,492
The campaign, the dinners
that you've hosted...

852
00:35:46,494 --> 00:35:49,094
It's a pleasure.
I admire what you stand for.

853
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:50,762
Oh. Thank you.

854
00:35:51,931 --> 00:35:54,731
Mrs. barron,
have you met...

855
00:35:54,733 --> 00:35:56,666
Do you like fruit?

856
00:35:56,668 --> 00:35:58,634
Yes, I do. Do you?

857
00:35:58,636 --> 00:36:01,169
Oh, yeah,
I like strawberries.

858
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:02,670
Miss wood, I'm--

859
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:03,971
do you like yogurt?

860
00:36:03,973 --> 00:36:04,972
I'm Arthur
fleischer.

861
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:06,106
You do?

862
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:08,041
We met at
the peace seminar

863
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:09,108
in Santa Barbara.

864
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:10,142
Oh, yes.

865
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:13,011
I'm on leave
of absence to work

866
00:36:13,013 --> 00:36:14,278
on foreign policy
aspects

867
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,246
of this campaign.

868
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:17,747
That's...Wonderful.

869
00:36:17,749 --> 00:36:18,981
It's
very interesting,

870
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,515
you know. It's--

871
00:36:20,517 --> 00:36:23,217
Arthur, you're
needed over here.

872
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:25,452
Natalie wood: You know
what you should do?

873
00:36:25,454 --> 00:36:27,987
Bill. Mr. McKay? Bill?

874
00:36:27,989 --> 00:36:29,154
Mr. McKay?

875
00:36:29,156 --> 00:36:31,389
Oh, you
just throw it in?

876
00:36:31,391 --> 00:36:34,392
Mr. McKay, we've got
to get on the phone.

877
00:36:34,394 --> 00:36:36,994
Could you move
it through?

878
00:36:36,996 --> 00:36:38,462
If you don't
have much time--

879
00:36:38,464 --> 00:36:40,330
we've got to get
to the phone.

880
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:41,964
Anyway, nice
to meet you.

881
00:36:41,966 --> 00:36:43,499
Nice to meet you.

882
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:46,234
She's been waiting
on the phone

883
00:36:46,236 --> 00:36:47,468
a half an hour, bill.

884
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,969
What's her name?

885
00:36:48,971 --> 00:36:49,970
York.

886
00:36:49,972 --> 00:36:51,705
Ah.

887
00:36:51,707 --> 00:36:53,573
¶ We love him,
we need him ¶

888
00:36:53,575 --> 00:36:55,875
¶ we know
that he'll win... ¶

889
00:36:55,877 --> 00:36:57,376
I know. I know.

890
00:36:57,378 --> 00:36:58,543
¶ I say, he will win ¶

891
00:36:58,545 --> 00:37:00,411
¶ we're all for McKay ¶

892
00:37:00,413 --> 00:37:02,379
¶ he can do it today ¶

893
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:06,248
¶ he can show you
a better way... ¶

894
00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:08,383
thank you.
I hope so, too. Bye.

895
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:09,650
Well, that's it.

896
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:10,984
I don't know what
her name is,

897
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:12,385
but she's sending a check.

00:43:07,953 --> 00:43:09,953
Crapshoot made
this country great.

1071
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:12,588
God made this country great.

1072
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,791
God shoots crap.

1073
00:43:14,793 --> 00:43:15,925
My little...

1074
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,260
Grandson's playing it.

1075
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,928
<i> Los Angeles</i>
<i> international airport.</i>

1076
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:23,264
<i> For those of you going on</i>
<i> with us to San Diego,</i>

1077
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:25,699
<i> our scheduled</i>
<i> departure time will be...</i>

1078
00:43:25,701 --> 00:43:27,367
Got to get off.
There's been a change of plan.

1079
00:43:27,369 --> 00:43:29,869
Get off? What about
the group in San Diego?

1080
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:31,070
Never mind that.

1081
00:43:31,072 --> 00:43:33,037
We got a fire in Malibu.
It's perfect.

1082
00:43:35,241 --> 00:43:38,274
Looking down at a major
brush and forest...

1083
00:43:40,778 --> 00:43:44,179
It looks to me like about
a 30-square-mile area

1084
00:43:44,181 --> 00:43:46,514
on both sides
of the Mountain.

1085
00:43:46,516 --> 00:43:49,383
[Siren]

1086
00:43:54,056 --> 00:43:55,388
There's the nbc
helicopter.

1087
00:43:55,390 --> 00:43:57,323
Yeah, that means that
the wire service guys

1088
00:43:57,325 --> 00:43:58,424
are up there, too.

1089
00:43:58,426 --> 00:44:00,559
We can hit them
on 3 points--

1090
00:44:00,561 --> 00:44:01,560
the fire-disaster
insurance,

1091
00:44:01,562 --> 00:44:02,894
the watershed stuff,

1092
00:44:02,896 --> 00:44:05,096
and the fire-prevention
program we talked about.

1093
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:06,664
I want to do
the watershed

1094
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:08,098
because fires like this
come from neglect.

1095
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,699
Yeah, but disaster
insurance is now.

1096
00:44:09,701 --> 00:44:11,300
These people
are losing their homes

1097
00:44:11,302 --> 00:44:12,301
and their possessions,

1098
00:44:12,303 --> 00:44:13,568
and the companies
won't underwrite them.

1099
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:14,635
That damn jarmon

1100
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:15,569
is against the
federal government

1101
00:44:15,571 --> 00:44:16,736
even getting
into it.

1102
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:17,737
Don't turn this
into an issues thing.

1103
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:19,138
It'll look
like you're trying

1104
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:21,006
to make political capital
out of a fire.

1105
00:44:21,008 --> 00:44:22,874
I'm not making political
capital out of it.

1106
00:44:22,876 --> 00:44:25,142
O.K., but don't hit them
over the head with it.

1107
00:44:27,312 --> 00:44:29,211
Closer, will ya?

1108
00:44:29,213 --> 00:44:30,278
Closer!

1109
00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:33,113
Start with
the watershed,

1110
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:35,181
and then go into
insurance, o.K.?

1111
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:36,248
O.K. All right.

1112
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,350
Bill wants to talk
to some of the firemen.

1113
00:44:38,352 --> 00:44:40,018
Bill, over here.

1114
00:44:41,988 --> 00:44:43,854
O.K., fellas,
bill McKay here.

1115
00:44:43,856 --> 00:44:45,455
Bill McKay.

1116
00:44:45,457 --> 00:44:47,757
That's it,
bill McKay.

1117
00:44:47,759 --> 00:44:49,425
[Everyone talking
at once]

1118
00:44:54,631 --> 00:44:56,897
We've lost
over 40 homes so far.

1119
00:44:56,899 --> 00:44:58,431
You want to make
a statement?

1120
00:44:58,433 --> 00:44:59,465
Yes, I do.

1121
00:44:59,467 --> 00:45:01,166
To me, this is a result

1122
00:45:01,168 --> 00:45:02,967
of what we've been
talking about.

1123
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:05,903
That is, when you
erode the watershed

1124
00:45:05,905 --> 00:45:07,905
with large-scale,
indiscriminate road-building

1125
00:45:07,907 --> 00:45:08,972
and development

1126
00:45:08,974 --> 00:45:10,907
so that you lose
the root system

1127
00:45:10,909 --> 00:45:12,508
that keeps the water
in the ground

1128
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:13,642
in the first place,

1129
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:14,676
that's why this brush
all dries out.

1130
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,144
Of course, you need...

1131
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,412
[Helicopter drowns him out]

1132
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:24,217
Do you know
who that is?

1133
00:45:24,219 --> 00:45:25,851
McKay: Yeah.

1134
00:45:25,853 --> 00:45:27,219
Smokey the bear.

1135
00:45:27,221 --> 00:45:28,420
All right, gentlemen,
can we have your attention?

1136
00:45:28,422 --> 00:45:30,355
The senator's going
to make a statement.

1137
00:45:30,357 --> 00:45:32,623
Here. This way, please.

1138
00:45:32,625 --> 00:45:34,024
Hello. How are you?

1139
00:45:34,026 --> 00:45:36,493
I'm still hoping for
a chance to debate you.

1140
00:45:36,495 --> 00:45:37,794
Don't blame you
a bit.

1141
00:45:37,796 --> 00:45:38,961
Hi, Jack.

1142
00:45:38,963 --> 00:45:41,697
Glad to see
you got your wet suit on.

1143
00:45:41,699 --> 00:45:43,298
All right, now...

1144
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,599
I'm, uh...

1145
00:45:44,601 --> 00:45:46,867
Everybody set?

1146
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:50,136
I will make this
very brief.

1147
00:45:50,138 --> 00:45:53,339
I have been on the phone
with the president,

1148
00:45:53,341 --> 00:45:55,140
and one hour from now,

1149
00:45:55,142 --> 00:45:59,343
Malibu will be declared
a national disaster area,

1150
00:45:59,345 --> 00:46:01,111
and I am assured

1151
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:04,547
that within
the next 24 hours,

1152
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:07,082
this fire will be checked.

1153
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:10,085
Our concern is to make
absolutely certain

1154
00:46:10,087 --> 00:46:13,688
that these disasters do
not occur in the future.

1155
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:16,691
That is why I am
very happy to see

1156
00:46:16,693 --> 00:46:18,693
that Mr. McKay
took the trouble

1157
00:46:18,695 --> 00:46:20,961
to be on hand
for this announcement.

1158
00:46:20,963 --> 00:46:21,995
When I leave here,

1159
00:46:21,997 --> 00:46:23,830
I am flying
back to Washington

1160
00:46:23,832 --> 00:46:27,566
to introduce the jarmon
watershed bill,

1161
00:46:27,568 --> 00:46:29,834
which will
include provisions

1162
00:46:29,836 --> 00:46:33,571
for federally financed
disaster insurance.

1163
00:46:33,573 --> 00:46:37,174
I think I can guarantee
swift passage of that bill

1164
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:39,142
through the senate
finance committee

1165
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:42,645
because I happen to be
chairman of that committee.

1166
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:45,247
So, we are doing
all we can,

1167
00:46:45,249 --> 00:46:48,016
and I want to add
my personal thanks

1168
00:46:48,018 --> 00:46:50,618
to all
of the heroic volunteers

1169
00:46:50,620 --> 00:46:51,986
who have risked
their lives

1170
00:46:51,988 --> 00:46:53,153
in this holocaust

1171
00:46:53,155 --> 00:46:56,756
to save the homes
of their neighbors.

1172
00:46:56,758 --> 00:46:58,758
Your actions
and your efforts

1173
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,594
have been an inspiration
to us all.

1174
00:47:01,596 --> 00:47:03,696
So I say goodbye,
God bless you,

1175
00:47:03,698 --> 00:47:04,997
and good luck.

1176
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:06,365
Thank you,
senator.

1177
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:14,638
Reporter: Do you have
a statement?

1178
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,805
What's
your reaction?

1179
00:47:15,807 --> 00:47:17,206
Any comments?
Any comment on that?

1180
00:47:17,208 --> 00:47:19,208
What about
the watershed bill?

1181
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:20,909
I haven't read the bill.
I, uh--

1182
00:47:20,911 --> 00:47:23,878
sounds like
a good proposal.

1183
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,479
Look, it's an emergency.

1184
00:47:25,481 --> 00:47:27,747
I welcome any action at all.

1185
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:30,483
Uh, Mr. jarmon
says that--

1186
00:47:30,485 --> 00:47:32,184
[crowd cheers]

1187
00:47:32,186 --> 00:47:36,888
Says that he's taking
his case, uh, to the public.

1188
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:39,891
Well, then why does
he refuse to meet me

1189
00:47:39,893 --> 00:47:41,626
in open debate?

1190
00:47:41,628 --> 00:47:43,694
Jarmon's the one!

1191
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:45,429
[Crowd heckling]

1192
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:48,865
Mr. jarmon says the economy
is moving again.

1193
00:47:48,867 --> 00:47:50,433
Then why is my office
in San Diego

1194
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:53,035
filled with people
looking for work?

1195
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,637
Now, I say there's got
to be a better way.

1196
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:56,838
We have to retool--

1197
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,839
[microphone feedback]

1198
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,374
Some of our industry.

1199
00:48:00,376 --> 00:48:02,576
We have to build
our strengths--

[microphone squeals]

1201
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:06,479

that people can use.

00:48:09,784 --> 00:48:10,816
I'm sorry.

1204

I'll have it
fixed in a second.

Here, just like this.

the one you want!

1213
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:30,194
It doesn't
matter, right?

1214
00:48:30,196 --> 00:48:32,996
Never mind.
It doesn't matter.

1215
00:48:41,439 --> 00:48:42,237
Bill, I'm sorry,

1216
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,340
but this has got
to be lunch.

1217
00:48:45,342 --> 00:48:47,942
Now, look, jenkin's
got 500 farmers

1218
00:48:47,944 --> 00:48:50,544
in a high school gym
over in Bakersfield.

1219
00:48:50,546 --> 00:48:51,945
That's where
we're going?

1220
00:48:51,947 --> 00:48:53,079
Yeah.

about the whole
farm program,

and jarmon's
the one

1224
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,216
that got it
out of committee.

1225
00:48:59,886 --> 00:49:02,720
A better way...

1226
00:49:02,722 --> 00:49:07,624
And that way is to subsidize
the small farmer directly,

1227
00:49:07,626 --> 00:49:10,827
rather than pay the huge
agricultural combine

1228
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:12,728
to wipe him out.

Damn that jenkin!
Why didn't he call?

1240
00:49:50,225 --> 00:49:52,058
Why couldn't he just
pick up a phone

1241
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:53,392
and say that
there's no one there?

1242
00:49:53,394 --> 00:49:54,760
He was probably trying
to get through.

this now, or we're dead.

Now, those guys want
to talk to the candidate.

1251

They got to file
in half an hour,

1252
00:50:09,271 --> 00:50:10,403
and they want
a statement.

1253
00:50:10,405 --> 00:50:12,004
The statement is,
it's not true.

1254
00:50:12,006 --> 00:50:13,505
We'll give them
more tomorrow.

1255

No. I can't go--

1256
00:50:14,508 --> 00:50:16,241

going to comment

1257
00:50:16,243 --> 00:50:17,475

1262

1268
00:50:35,924 --> 00:50:37,523
is really for jarmon.

1269

You're kidding.

No. It's coming out
tomorrow morning.

this afternoon.

1275

They went up
to his house?

Yeah, operator?

00:50:49,367 --> 00:50:50,933
I want to make a call
to Los Angeles.

"Hello, boys!
How are you?"

1280
00:50:54,437 --> 00:50:56,437
Got through to brokaw,
and he confirmed it.

1281
00:50:56,439 --> 00:50:58,605
We got through to brokaw,
and he confirmed it!

I'm a half hour
ahead of you.

Now, will you get
out of here, Wally?

1284
00:51:02,143 --> 00:51:03,375
Hello?
Are you ready?

1285
00:51:03,377 --> 00:51:05,210
Are you going to put
somebody on the door?

1286
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:07,045
Why don't you put one of
your brilliant advance men?

are on the bus.

All right.

And drive them
over a cliff.

Uh, honey, where
the hell did you go?

1292

Uh, I'm sorry.

No, I wasn't
cursing you.

one thing or another.

Well, that makes it
look true.

We'll have to look
at that on the 6:00 news.

David, will you go outside
and watch the door, please?

1301
00:51:30,398 --> 00:51:31,797
Just talk to me
straight, man.

1302

O.K., honey,

1303
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,536
Bill, you're just
going to have to go up

1304
00:51:39,538 --> 00:51:41,137
and talk to him.
It's the only way.

1305
00:51:41,139 --> 00:51:42,271
Oh, no.
We don't use him.

1306
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:43,572
I told you that
from the beginning.

O.K., uh, we'll just
announce you're quitting.

oh, Luke, stop it!
Will you get off my back?

1597
01:02:35,814 --> 01:02:37,713
I don't want anything
coming in here.

1598
01:02:37,715 --> 01:02:38,847
Jarmon's agreed to a debate.

1599
01:02:38,849 --> 01:02:40,248
Well, that's
fantastic!

1600
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,549
I want you to hold off
everything coming in here

1601
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:42,616
for 15 minutes.

1602
01:02:42,618 --> 01:02:43,583
But the board's
plugged through

1603
01:02:43,585 --> 01:02:44,717
for the evening.

1604
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,051
Find Harry and
get him to replug it.

1605
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:47,585
And close the curtains!

1606
01:02:47,587 --> 01:02:49,019
Whatever you say.

1607
01:02:49,021 --> 01:02:51,855
Now, I've got to go down there
and negotiate tomorrow.

1608
01:02:51,857 --> 01:02:53,389
We've got to pick
a panel to question you,

1609
01:02:53,391 --> 01:02:54,957
I got to make sure
you're sitting down.

1610
01:02:54,959 --> 01:02:56,858
Find out about
lighting...Panel...

1611
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:57,859
Why sitting down?

1612
01:02:57,861 --> 01:02:58,993
Makeup...

1613
01:02:58,995 --> 01:03:00,094
Why sitting down?

1614
01:03:00,096 --> 01:03:01,728
The man comes on
like your father.

1615
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,463
To avoid another
handshaking stunt

1616
01:03:03,465 --> 01:03:04,630
like at that damn fire.

1617
01:03:04,632 --> 01:03:05,931
He'll try to make you
look like a kid.

1618
01:03:05,933 --> 01:03:07,632
Well, I don't
give a damn.

1619
01:03:07,634 --> 01:03:08,933
And I don't want
a panel, either.

1620
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:10,134
I just want to get
up there

1621
01:03:10,136 --> 01:03:11,735
and say
what I came to say.

1622
01:03:11,737 --> 01:03:13,002
Well, we'll go over it,

1623
01:03:13,004 --> 01:03:14,303
but you can't say
too much on TV.

1624
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:15,871
I thought the point
was to say what I wanted.

1625
01:03:15,873 --> 01:03:17,072
Well, it is,

1626
01:03:17,074 --> 01:03:18,139
but in the right way
at the right time.

1627
01:03:18,141 --> 01:03:19,240
We never discussed
a right time.

1628
01:03:19,242 --> 01:03:20,808
We never had to
because you know--

1629
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:21,942
don't tell me
what I know!

1630
01:03:21,944 --> 01:03:23,877
Don't make me.
Get me--

1631
01:03:23,879 --> 01:03:25,545
put that damn phone down
and let's get this straight!

1632
01:03:25,547 --> 01:03:28,481
I want to know what
the hell this campaign is!

1633
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:36,621
We've come up 14 points
since we began.

1634
01:03:36,623 --> 01:03:40,457
That's why jarmon
is debating you.

1635
01:03:41,927 --> 01:03:44,394
The man is scared.

1636
01:03:44,396 --> 01:03:47,363
For the first time
in this campaign,

1637
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:49,031
you're getting through.

1638
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:50,799
And we're not at
the beginning anymore,

1639
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:52,300
and it's not my job

1640
01:03:52,302 --> 01:03:53,768
to explain everything
to you anymore.

1641
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,770
My job right now
is to avoid having you look

1642
01:03:55,772 --> 01:03:57,905
like you're sitting
on jarmon's lap,

1643
01:03:57,907 --> 01:04:00,440
and if you don't feel
I'm doing my job...

1644
01:04:00,442 --> 01:04:03,342
Well, then, you just tell me,
and I'll shove off.

1645
01:04:03,344 --> 01:04:04,442
Anytime.

1646
01:04:07,413 --> 01:04:09,045
Did you get spivak?

1647
01:04:09,047 --> 01:04:11,781
Uh...No. Hold on.

1648
01:04:11,783 --> 01:04:13,048
Uh, Bob, hold on.

1649
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,250
Uh, Lynn,
will you get--

1650
01:04:15,252 --> 01:04:16,084
Marvin...

1651
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,919
From here on out,
no promises.

1652
01:04:17,921 --> 01:04:20,254
I never asked you
to make promises.

1653
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,090
Lynn, will you
get fleischer

1654
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:23,758
for an 11:00 briefing session?

1655
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:24,759
Right. David?

1656
01:04:24,761 --> 01:04:26,827
You hear that,
Corey?

1657
01:04:26,829 --> 01:04:28,028
Get carr on the phone

1658
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,529
and tell him to start
earning his money.

1659
01:04:29,531 --> 01:04:30,530
Wally? Wally?

1660
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:31,531
Here, here!

1661
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:32,632
Oh, Wally...

1662
01:04:32,634 --> 01:04:33,633
Uh, yeah...

1663
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:35,267
No, no, no.

1664
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:36,901
What line is spivak on?

1665
01:04:36,903 --> 01:04:37,902
Yeah.

1666
01:04:37,904 --> 01:04:39,303
I can't call
from in here.

1667
01:04:39,305 --> 01:04:41,238
Call from
the other room!

1668
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:42,939
How much time do you need?

1669
01:04:42,941 --> 01:04:44,173
Well, we need...

1670
01:04:44,175 --> 01:04:46,041
[Everyone talking at once]

1671
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:54,914
Ladies and gentlemen,
have a pleasant afternoon

1672
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:56,048
in San Diego.

1673
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:56,915
O.K., group,
we're going to disembark

1674
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:58,182
through the front exit.

1675
01:04:58,184 --> 01:04:59,550
Then we'll proceed
to the South parking lot.

1676
01:04:59,552 --> 01:05:01,051
Wally: We'll be going
out the back.

1677
01:05:01,053 --> 01:05:02,485
Wally, out the front!

1678
01:05:02,487 --> 01:05:03,486
Just a minute.

1679
01:05:03,488 --> 01:05:04,487
What's wrong?

1680
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:05,387
It's stuck.

1681
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:06,921
Is jarmon taking
unfair advantage

1682
01:05:06,923 --> 01:05:07,922
of backlash?

1683
01:05:07,924 --> 01:05:08,923
Um, yes, I think--

1684
01:05:08,925 --> 01:05:10,057
excuse us, please.

1685
01:05:10,059 --> 01:05:11,458
Wally: Hold it!
Hold it, everybody!

1686
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:12,792
Bill, I've got
to talk to you.

1687
01:05:12,794 --> 01:05:13,793
What about?

1688
01:05:13,795 --> 01:05:15,227
Wally:
Just follow me.

1689
01:05:15,229 --> 01:05:16,228
Excuse me.
Coming through.

1690
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,463
Wait a minute!
What is it?

1691
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:20,665
Pilot: I'm sorry,
but you can't come in here.

1692
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,266
Nobody's allowed in here.

1693
01:05:22,268 --> 01:05:23,867
Jesus!

1694
01:05:23,869 --> 01:05:25,001
What's going on?

1695
01:05:25,003 --> 01:05:26,335
This isn't any
cocktail lounge. You--

1696
01:05:26,337 --> 01:05:28,070
look...It's not even
worth mentioning

1697
01:05:28,072 --> 01:05:29,805
an ad like that.

1698
01:05:29,807 --> 01:05:31,072
As far as
the shooting stuff

1699
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:32,273
in Oakland goes,

1700
01:05:32,275 --> 01:05:34,275
you have compassion
for all concerned,

1701
01:05:34,277 --> 01:05:35,909
but you're waiting
to hear the details.

1702
01:05:35,911 --> 01:05:37,310
And the reason
you're vulnerable

1703
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:38,444
on this stuff
is you haven't

1704
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:39,645
established yourself
on crime, right?

1705
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:41,613
You're going to have
to get out of here.

1706
01:05:41,615 --> 01:05:42,614
In a second,
officer.

1707
01:05:42,616 --> 01:05:43,514
This is bill McKay.

1708
01:05:43,516 --> 01:05:45,415
I don't care if
it's Henry Fonda.

1709
01:05:45,417 --> 01:05:47,750
Give him
the damn program.

1710
01:05:47,752 --> 01:05:48,751
Here it is.

1711
01:05:48,753 --> 01:05:50,486
This is your
crime program.

1712
01:05:50,488 --> 01:05:51,787
You have to get this

1713
01:05:51,789 --> 01:05:53,121
in your lunch speech
today,

1714
01:05:53,123 --> 01:05:54,755
and you have to
get it in the debate

1715
01:05:54,757 --> 01:05:55,922
tomorrow night.

1716
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:57,056
Whatever questions
they ask,

1717
01:05:57,058 --> 01:05:58,223
just give them
our answers.

1718
01:05:58,225 --> 01:06:00,291
Crime isn't an issue.
It's a symptom.

1719
01:06:00,293 --> 01:06:01,892
Hey, that's
a good line.

1720
01:06:01,894 --> 01:06:03,994
Yeah, for when
you write your book.

1721
01:06:03,996 --> 01:06:06,296
The point is now
to hit the 5-point

1722
01:06:06,298 --> 01:06:08,231
prevention
and enforcement stuff.

1723
01:06:08,233 --> 01:06:09,832
Part of
"the better way."

1724
01:06:09,834 --> 01:06:10,933
Right.

1725
01:06:10,935 --> 01:06:13,301
Better way
to screw 'em all.

1726
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:17,071
Lots of it.
Lots of it.

1727
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,439
Come on, fellas.
Only 15 minutes to air.

1728
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:21,208
Let's get to
the lighting effect.

1729
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:24,544
Are you sure it's o.K. On
the health insurance stuff?

1730
01:06:24,546 --> 01:06:25,745
Terrific stuff.

1731
01:06:25,747 --> 01:06:27,346
Jarmon will be left
no air if you say it like that.

1732
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:28,680
Got the figures?
Here they are.

1733
01:06:28,682 --> 01:06:30,081
It's number 23.

1734
01:06:30,083 --> 01:06:31,348
You want
to check it?

1735
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:32,816
Want to go
over it again?

1736
01:06:32,818 --> 01:06:33,817
No.

1737
01:06:33,819 --> 01:06:34,884
Give them our answers

1738
01:06:34,886 --> 01:06:35,818
no matter what
the questions are.

1739
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:36,852
Hey...
What?

1740
01:06:36,854 --> 01:06:38,286
Tie. Boring.
Let's change ties.

1741
01:06:38,288 --> 01:06:39,086
Why?

1742
01:06:39,088 --> 01:06:40,587
Never mind.

1743
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:43,989
Otherwise, you'll smudge
your makeup, you get it?

1744
01:06:43,991 --> 01:06:45,390
When you
get up there,

1745
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:46,524
you're going to be
sitting camera right.

1746
01:06:46,526 --> 01:06:48,058
All the time that
jarmon's talking,

1747
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:49,059
just keep looking
at jarmon.

1748
01:06:49,061 --> 01:06:50,160
[Cough]

1749
01:06:50,162 --> 01:06:51,060
Jarmon talks,
you look at jarmon.

1750
01:06:51,062 --> 01:06:52,294
[Cough]
Right.

1751
01:06:52,296 --> 01:06:53,461
Try to keep your eyes
steady. Don't blink.

1752
01:06:53,463 --> 01:06:55,029
Whatever you do,
don't look up at all.

1753
01:06:55,031 --> 01:06:56,030
Don't look up.

1754
01:06:56,032 --> 01:06:57,364
'Cause your eyes
are glazed,

1755
01:06:57,366 --> 01:06:58,631
then you look
all cockeyed.

1756
01:06:58,633 --> 01:06:59,865
You look
like a moron.

1757
01:06:59,867 --> 01:07:01,032
When you're
not gesturing...

1758
01:07:01,034 --> 01:07:02,066
Who's that?

1759
01:07:02,068 --> 01:07:03,033
Keep your fingers
interlaced.

1760
01:07:03,035 --> 01:07:04,034
Who's that?

1761
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:05,035
You got that?

1762
01:07:05,037 --> 01:07:06,036
Yeah. O.K.

1763
01:07:06,038 --> 01:07:07,103
I'm just
trying to help.

1764
01:07:07,105 --> 01:07:08,037
I can interlace
my own fingers.

1765
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:10,506
O.K., o.K.

1766
01:07:20,884 --> 01:07:21,883
5 seconds...

1767
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,050
4 seconds...

1768
01:07:23,052 --> 01:07:24,451
3 seconds...

1769
01:07:24,453 --> 01:07:25,585
2...

1770
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:26,986
1.

1771
01:07:26,988 --> 01:07:28,620
We're on the air,
and cue van.

1772
01:07:28,622 --> 01:07:29,954
<i> Tonight...</i>

1773
01:07:29,956 --> 01:07:32,523
<i> Senator Crocker jarmon</i>

1774

1775

1776
01:07:36,995 --> 01:07:39,261
<i> The jarmon-McKay debate.</i>

1777
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:42,297
<i> Good evening,</i>
<i> I'm van amberg, abc.</i>

1778
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:44,532
<i> I'll be your moderator</i>

1779
01:07:44,534 --> 01:07:46,133

<i> Rollin post...</i>

<i> Ken Jones...</i>

<i> And Maury green.</i>

1786
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:57,274
<i>We'll begin our questioning now</i>
<i> with Maury green.</i>

1787
01:07:57,276 --> 01:08:00,210
Mr. McKay, at the beginning
of your campaign,

1788
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:02,045
you favored busing

1789
01:08:02,047 --> 01:08:03,980
to achieve integration
in the schools.

1790
01:08:03,982 --> 01:08:05,514
Lately, you seem
to be against it.

1791
01:08:05,516 --> 01:08:07,382
Which is it--
for or against?

1792
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:09,384
Well, we can't
let a school bus

1793
01:08:09,386 --> 01:08:11,152
carry all the burdens
of our society.

1794
01:08:11,154 --> 01:08:12,553
The main problem
is still,

1795
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,755
how do we get
a first-rate education

1796
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:15,956
for each
and every child?

1797
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:17,157
We can't afford

1798
01:08:17,159 --> 01:08:18,992
to have inferior
schools anywhere,

1799
01:08:18,994 --> 01:08:20,593
and we--we should
always try to preserve

1800
01:08:20,595 --> 01:08:22,261
the concept of
the neighborhood school

1801
01:08:22,263 --> 01:08:23,962
in achieving this.

1802
01:08:23,964 --> 01:08:25,530
Aw, shit.

1803
01:08:25,532 --> 01:08:27,131
Gentlemen, is pollution
a political issue

1804
01:08:27,133 --> 01:08:28,398
in this campaign,

1805
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,133
or is this one subject
you both can agree on?

1806
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:32,702
Ha ha. Of course
it's not political.

1807
01:08:32,704 --> 01:08:36,138
Now, let's look at that oil
spill that fouled our beaches.

1808
01:08:36,140 --> 01:08:38,240
Now, I warned about
that oil spill.

1809
01:08:38,242 --> 01:08:42,877
I testified, I hollered
for stronger regulation.

1810
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,980
But...We needed the oil,

1811
01:08:45,982 --> 01:08:47,381
and we weren't
careful enough

1812
01:08:47,383 --> 01:08:49,249
about how we went in
and got it.

1813
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:52,585
So, I end up in the shower
along with everybody else,

1814
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:56,421
trying to scrub the oil
out of my old gray hair.

1815
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:00,524
Now, when
it comes to smog,

1816
01:09:00,526 --> 01:09:04,393
we are bucking the dream
of every private citizen

1817
01:09:04,395 --> 01:09:05,994
in his own automobile.

1818
01:09:05,996 --> 01:09:09,030
So...We had to
take on the battle

1819
01:09:09,032 --> 01:09:10,498
of installing devices,

1820
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:15,235
and we are gradually seeing
that shift-over take effect.

1821
01:09:15,237 --> 01:09:18,238
In fact, I think
we can now say,

1822
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:20,039
as a result of
our herculean labors,

1823
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:22,908
that we are turning
the corner on smog

1824
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:25,210
here in California.

1825
01:09:25,212 --> 01:09:27,345
Moderator:
Mr. McKay.

1826
01:09:27,347 --> 01:09:30,081
I don't think we
can see the corner,

1827
01:09:30,083 --> 01:09:31,649
much less turn it.

1828
01:09:31,651 --> 01:09:33,150
I won't say it's
a matter of Republicans

1829
01:09:33,152 --> 01:09:34,151
or democrats,

1830
01:09:34,153 --> 01:09:35,986
but it's politics,
all right,

1831
01:09:35,988 --> 01:09:39,189
when the politicians put
the needs of the polluters

1832
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:40,723
over the needs
of the public.

1833
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:43,325
We have the money
to do this job.

1834
01:09:43,327 --> 01:09:45,694
We don't have to
raise taxes one cent.

1835
01:09:45,696 --> 01:09:47,662
We just have to
have the leadership

1836
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:49,463
to get the job done.

1837
01:09:50,632 --> 01:09:51,631
Mr. McKay,

1838
01:09:51,633 --> 01:09:54,634
what do you think of
legalizing abortion?

1839
01:09:54,636 --> 01:09:57,803
Well, this is a matter that
not only concerns women,

1840
01:09:57,805 --> 01:09:59,204
but all of us.

1841
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:00,605
We can't tolerate
leadership

1842
01:10:00,607 --> 01:10:02,073
that shuts its eyes
to the problem.

1843
01:10:02,075 --> 01:10:03,274
And it certainly deserves

1844
01:10:03,276 --> 01:10:05,376
a lot more study
than it's been getting.

1845
01:10:05,378 --> 01:10:06,877
Senator jarmon.

1846
01:10:06,879 --> 01:10:09,145
Well, I'm an old-fashioned guy
when it comes to this,

1847
01:10:09,147 --> 01:10:11,213
and I don't care
who knows it.

1848
01:10:11,215 --> 01:10:14,616
I say that human life
is sacrosanct.

1849
01:10:14,618 --> 01:10:15,516
It is God given,

1850
01:10:15,518 --> 01:10:17,518
and we must have control

1851
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,987
over just how and when
we let people take it away.

1852
01:10:20,989 --> 01:10:22,288
Mr. McKay,

1853
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:23,922
until recently,
the public opinion polls

1854
01:10:23,924 --> 01:10:26,257
have shown senator jarmon
substantially ahead,

1855
01:10:26,259 --> 01:10:29,026
but reportedly, you are
beginning to catch up,

1856
01:10:29,028 --> 01:10:30,327
although
you're still behind.

1857
01:10:30,329 --> 01:10:32,962
Now, what effect will
the public opinion polls

1858
01:10:32,964 --> 01:10:35,497
have on your campaign?

1859
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:38,366
I'm the underdog, so I
don't believe in polls.

1860
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:39,767
I wouldn't believe
in them anyhow.

1861
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,236
I don't think you can
trim what you say

1862
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:43,471
to suit someone's poll.

1863
01:10:43,473 --> 01:10:46,207
Mr. McKay,
your opponent has implied

1864
01:10:46,209 --> 01:10:48,342
you have nothing
to say about crime.

1865
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:49,609
Do you?

1866
01:10:51,212 --> 01:10:53,745
I have put out
a 5-point program

1867
01:10:53,747 --> 01:10:56,080
on prevention
and enforcement.

1868
01:10:56,082 --> 01:10:58,582
That program
spells out in detail

1869
01:10:58,584 --> 01:10:59,849
the training and equipment

1870
01:10:59,851 --> 01:11:02,351
of the men
who enforce the laws,

1871
01:11:02,353 --> 01:11:04,619
and we must
give them every means

1872
01:11:04,621 --> 01:11:07,488
with which to handle crimes
against person and property

1873
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:09,890
with speed,
effectiveness, and safety.

1874
01:11:09,892 --> 01:11:11,958
In addition,
we've got to set forth

1875
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,225
the type of system

1876
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,626
that can stop crime

1877
01:11:14,628 --> 01:11:17,095
before it has a chance
to start.

1878
01:11:17,097 --> 01:11:18,329
Senator jarmon.

1879
01:11:18,331 --> 01:11:20,230
Well, of course
it's very easy

1880
01:11:20,232 --> 01:11:23,233
for anyone to come
into it at this time

1881
01:11:23,235 --> 01:11:24,234
and say anything

1882
01:11:24,236 --> 01:11:25,501
that might capitalize--

1883
01:11:25,503 --> 01:11:28,370
to pretend that you
have all the answers

1884
01:11:28,372 --> 01:11:29,904
for a situation

1885
01:11:29,906 --> 01:11:33,840
that you--you may
have helped encourage.

1886
01:11:33,842 --> 01:11:35,908
Indirectly, that is.

1887
01:11:35,910 --> 01:11:38,777
The question is, where
do you draw the line?

1888
01:11:38,779 --> 01:11:42,380
For some people,
their idea of getting tough

1889
01:11:42,382 --> 01:11:45,349
is longer
suspended sentences.

1890
01:11:45,351 --> 01:11:47,517
Let's just think
where crime comes from.

1891
01:11:47,519 --> 01:11:51,187
Studies have proved that
it's this whole attitude

1892
01:11:51,189 --> 01:11:53,989
of permissiveness.

1893
01:11:53,991 --> 01:11:56,257
Well, let's face it.

1894
01:11:56,259 --> 01:11:58,125
That attitude has
given us

1895
01:11:58,127 --> 01:12:00,527
some real bums
to contend with.

1896
01:12:00,529 --> 01:12:05,130
Society has gone soft
as an old banana.

1897
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:06,264
Senator jarmon,

1898
01:12:06,266 --> 01:12:07,665
at the beginning
of your campaign,

1899
01:12:07,667 --> 01:12:09,533
your supporters
predicted

1900
01:12:09,535 --> 01:12:11,468
a record-breaking
victory margin.

1901
01:12:11,470 --> 01:12:13,269
Do you still go
along with that?

1902
01:12:13,271 --> 01:12:14,670
Well, Ken, I've played

1903
01:12:14,672 --> 01:12:16,538
on too many losing
football teams

1904
01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:19,807
where we thought
we had it won...

1905
01:12:19,809 --> 01:12:24,177
Of course I've played in
many more winning occasions.

1906
01:12:24,179 --> 01:12:27,547
But I have learned
never to predict

1907
01:12:27,549 --> 01:12:29,081
whether you're
going to win or lose

1908
01:12:29,083 --> 01:12:31,283
or what that point spread's
going to be.

1909
01:12:31,285 --> 01:12:33,218
If the people
have faith in you

1910
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:36,454
and think that faith will
be reflected, that's fine.

1911
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:37,688
Mr. McKay--

1912
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:39,723
but you don't predict.

1913
01:12:39,725 --> 01:12:41,691
Moderator:
Thank you, senator.

1914
01:12:41,693 --> 01:12:43,926
Gentlemen, relax
for just a moment

1915
01:12:43,928 --> 01:12:45,827
while we pause
for this message.

1916
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:49,030
We'll be back with our
debate in just a moment.

1917
01:12:49,032 --> 01:12:49,830
I told you,

1918
01:12:49,832 --> 01:12:51,431
you got balls
in both hands.

1919
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:52,698
Just wait, o.K.?

1920
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:00,437
[Muted conversations]

1921
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:01,971
I think so.

1922
01:13:12,916 --> 01:13:14,448
...not the fireworks

1923
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:17,050
I expected
with this group.

1924
01:13:17,052 --> 01:13:18,051
Say something.

1925
01:13:18,053 --> 01:13:19,452
Yeah, probably.

1926
01:13:26,093 --> 01:13:27,992
<i> Lay them right over</i>
<i> each other.</i>

1927
01:13:27,994 --> 01:13:31,628
<i> Just a normal shot...</i>
<i> Wider...O.K.</i>

1928
01:13:31,630 --> 01:13:34,063
<i> 3, tighten up</i>
<i> just a touch.</i>

1929
01:13:34,065 --> 01:13:35,631
Get ready
to fade in.

1930
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:38,333
We come now to our
concluding statements.

1931
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,867
Each candidate
will have one minute.

1932
01:13:39,869 --> 01:13:42,336
The order was picked
by the flip of a coin,

1933
01:13:42,338 --> 01:13:44,171
and senator jarmon
will go first.

1934
01:13:44,173 --> 01:13:45,372
Senator jarmon.

1935
01:13:45,374 --> 01:13:49,208
To me, this country
was never stronger,

1936
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:51,476
but the test
of a strong country

1937
01:13:51,478 --> 01:13:54,946
is how it faces
its difficulties.

1938
01:13:54,948 --> 01:13:56,013
And now and then,

1939
01:13:56,015 --> 01:13:58,749
when I hear the barking
and the baying

1940
01:13:58,751 --> 01:14:02,352
of those who would
knock our system down,

1941
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:04,687
I'm reminded
of the last days

1942
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:06,488
of the great Roman empire.

1943
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:11,759
They argued about what vices
they could legalize,

1944
01:14:11,761 --> 01:14:14,161
and what happened
was an onslaught

1945
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:17,097
that nearly spelled
the end of civilization.

1946
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:19,966
Now, I am not suggesting

1947
01:14:19,968 --> 01:14:22,034
that that
is what will happen

1948
01:14:22,036 --> 01:14:26,104
if the people do not send me
back to the senate.

1949
01:14:26,106 --> 01:14:28,039
I just promise you this--

1950
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:31,908
I will continue to stand up
for the philosophy

1951
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:34,343
that has made
this nation great,

1952
01:14:34,345 --> 01:14:36,645
and is more than ever
called for

1953
01:14:36,647 --> 01:14:38,913
if we are to face
the future

1954
01:14:38,915 --> 01:14:40,748
with hope
and confidence.

1955
01:14:40,750 --> 01:14:45,652
I have that hope
because I believe in America.

1956
01:14:45,654 --> 01:14:47,520
I believe that
our greatest moment

1957
01:14:47,522 --> 01:14:50,856
is yet to come.

1958
01:14:50,858 --> 01:14:52,224
Thank you.

1959
01:14:52,226 --> 01:14:53,325
Mr. McKay,

1960
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:57,662
you now have one minute
to sum up.

1961
01:15:02,001 --> 01:15:03,867
Mr. McKay.

1962
01:15:07,805 --> 01:15:10,205
In the begin--I don't--
I think it's important

1963
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:13,541
to note what subjects
we haven't discussed.

1964
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,809
We've completely
ignored the fact

1965
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:17,410
that this is a society

1966
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:21,013
divided by fear, hatred,
and violence.

1967
01:15:21,015 --> 01:15:22,547
And until we talk

1968
01:15:22,549 --> 01:15:24,081
about just what this
society really is,

1969
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:27,084
then I don't know how
we're going to change it.

1970
01:15:27,086 --> 01:15:28,819
For example, we haven't
discussed

1971
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:30,554
the rot that
destroys our cities.

1972
01:15:30,556 --> 01:15:32,589
We have all
the resources we need

1973
01:15:32,591 --> 01:15:33,856
to check it,
and we don't use them,

1974
01:15:33,858 --> 01:15:35,924
and we haven't discussed
why not.

1975
01:15:35,926 --> 01:15:38,359
We haven't discussed
race in this country.

1976
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:39,893
We haven't
discussed poverty.

1977
01:15:39,895 --> 01:15:41,427
In short,
we haven't discussed

1978
01:15:41,429 --> 01:15:43,429
any of the sicknesses
that may yet bl--

1979
01:15:43,431 --> 01:15:46,098
send this country
up in flames,

1980
01:15:46,100 --> 01:15:47,365
and we'd better do it.

1981
01:15:47,367 --> 01:15:49,100
We'd better get it
out in the open

1982
01:15:49,102 --> 01:15:50,367
and confront it...

1983
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:51,668

1984

Gentlemen--

1985
01:15:52,837 --> 01:15:55,571
you had to do it,
didn't you?

1986
01:15:55,573 --> 01:15:57,573
I never dreamed
that my opponent

1987
01:15:57,575 --> 01:16:00,542
would stoop
to encouraging violence.

1988
01:16:00,544 --> 01:16:02,277
I very seriously
doubt--

1989
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:04,746
that is not
what I said.

the person who is
weeping the loudest

the fullest advantage

successful country

2103
01:20:31,989 --> 01:20:35,590

Yes!
Yes!

2107
01:20:40,763 --> 01:20:43,997

we must obey our laws

2108

how he appreciates

2118
01:21:29,171 --> 01:21:30,904
your being here,
Mr. starkey.

2119
01:21:30,906 --> 01:21:33,039
He's got a hell
of a way of showing it.

2120
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:35,975
He probably got held up
on the freeway.

2121
01:21:35,977 --> 01:21:38,077
No. I saw him
in the hotel.

2122
01:21:44,584 --> 01:21:46,850
Well, there are some
things more important

2123
01:21:46,852 --> 01:21:48,284
than an election.

2124
01:21:48,286 --> 01:21:51,720
I don't know what the hell
you mean by that.

2125
01:21:53,390 --> 01:21:54,989
John.

2126
01:21:57,660 --> 01:21:58,925
I'm telling you, John,

2127
01:21:58,927 --> 01:22:00,927
I'm just about
to the point

2128
01:22:00,929 --> 01:22:02,428
where it's not worth it.

2129
01:22:02,430 --> 01:22:03,462
You think not, huh?

2130
01:22:03,464 --> 01:22:05,931
I think he's gonna
get his ass kicked.

2131
01:22:05,933 --> 01:22:08,533
He's not gonna get
his ass kicked.

2132
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:10,801
Oh, yeah?

2133
01:22:10,803 --> 01:22:12,469
He's cute.

2134
01:22:33,090 --> 01:22:35,223
I'm sorry.
Am I late?

2135
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:38,425
Hello, bud.
Hi.

2136
01:22:38,427 --> 01:22:41,127
Bill, this is
Floyd j. Starkey.

2137
01:22:41,129 --> 01:22:42,495
He has to leave
in a few minutes

2138
01:22:42,497 --> 01:22:44,497
because 100,000
teamsters in this state

2139
01:22:44,499 --> 01:22:46,599
are waiting to hear
what he has to say.

2140
01:22:46,601 --> 01:22:47,866
Is there
any cream?

2141
01:22:47,868 --> 01:22:49,200
Uh, here.

2142
01:22:49,202 --> 01:22:53,103
Bud, this is a man who
can do you a lot of good.

2143
01:22:54,573 --> 01:22:56,072
Oh, yeah?

2144
01:22:56,074 --> 01:22:58,841
And you can probably
do us some good,

2145
01:22:58,843 --> 01:23:00,742
if you get
to Washington.

2146
01:23:00,744 --> 01:23:02,276
You didn't do much good

2147
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:04,845
trying to break up
the farm workers.

2148
01:23:04,847 --> 01:23:06,246
Oh? Yeah?

2149
01:23:06,248 --> 01:23:10,149
That isn't
how I'd put it.

2150
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,551
Well, there's no point

2151
01:23:13,553 --> 01:23:15,252
in us chewing over
our differences.

2152
01:23:15,254 --> 01:23:16,886
When we get
right down to it,

2153
01:23:16,888 --> 01:23:19,355
you might find we have
a lot in common.

2154
01:23:19,357 --> 01:23:22,157
I don't think we have
shit in common.

2155
01:23:31,768 --> 01:23:32,933
[Laughing]

2156
01:23:32,935 --> 01:23:35,201
[Everyone laughing]

2157
01:23:42,810 --> 01:23:45,544
And now...The man--

2158
01:23:45,546 --> 01:23:47,879
the man you've all
been waiting for.

2159
01:23:47,881 --> 01:23:51,781
Our next senator, from this
great state of California,

2160
01:23:51,783 --> 01:23:54,183
bill McKay!

2161
01:23:54,185 --> 01:23:56,451
[Loud applause and cheering]

2162
01:24:04,494 --> 01:24:08,429
We want bill!
We want bill!

2163
01:24:08,431 --> 01:24:11,899
We want bill!
We want bill!

2164
01:24:11,901 --> 01:24:15,035
We want bill!
We want bill!

2165
01:24:15,037 --> 01:24:18,304
We want bill!
We want bill!

2166
01:24:18,306 --> 01:24:22,040
We want bill!
We want bill!

2167
01:24:22,042 --> 01:24:24,142
We want bill!
We want bill!

2168
01:24:24,144 --> 01:24:28,178
We want bill!
We want bill!

2169
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:30,747
We want bill!
We want bill...

2170
01:24:36,521 --> 01:24:38,053
I, um...

2171
01:24:38,055 --> 01:24:40,622
Just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

2172
01:24:44,927 --> 01:24:48,328
Seriously, it's nice
to be talking

2173
01:24:48,330 --> 01:24:50,430
to an audience
of working people,

2174
01:24:50,432 --> 01:24:53,932
because I can congratulate
you on having jobs.

2175
01:24:53,934 --> 01:24:56,200
[Applause]

2176
01:24:56,202 --> 01:24:59,336
You do have jobs,
don't you?

2177
01:24:59,338 --> 01:25:01,638
How many are out of work?

2178
01:25:03,375 --> 01:25:06,976
Well, the unemployment figure
for this state is 8%.

2179
01:25:06,978 --> 01:25:08,377
Think of it.

2180
01:25:08,379 --> 01:25:12,147
The biggest, the richest,
the most powerful country

2181
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:16,083
cannot keep
its full job force working.

2182
01:25:16,085 --> 01:25:18,385
It cannot tend
all its sick people.

2183
01:25:18,387 --> 01:25:22,021
It cannot feed
all its hungry people

2184
01:25:22,023 --> 01:25:25,290
or decently house
its poor people.

2185
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:28,126
It cannot educate everyone
who needs an education.

2186
01:25:28,128 --> 01:25:31,696
I say there has got to be
a better way.

2187
01:25:36,836 --> 01:25:39,136
We want bill!
We want bill!

2188
01:25:39,138 --> 01:25:42,372
We want bill!
We want bill!

2189
01:25:42,374 --> 01:25:44,273
We want bill!
We want bill!

2190
01:25:44,275 --> 01:25:47,776
We want bill!
We want bill!

2191
01:25:47,778 --> 01:25:51,379
To me, that's what this
election is all about...

2192
01:25:51,381 --> 01:25:55,216
Because the time has passed
when you can turn your back

2193
01:25:55,218 --> 01:25:57,484
on the fundamental needs
of the people.

2194
01:26:02,758 --> 01:26:06,759
And don't think that you
can distract them anymore

2195
01:26:06,761 --> 01:26:10,495
by playing off
the young against the old,

2196
01:26:10,497 --> 01:26:12,530
the black
against the white,

2197
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:16,400
the poor against
the less poor.

2198
01:26:28,980 --> 01:26:32,548
I think the time has come

2199
01:26:32,550 --> 01:26:35,551
when the American people
realize

2200
01:26:35,553 --> 01:26:37,953
that we're
in this together...

2201
01:26:39,423 --> 01:26:43,958
And that we sink or swim
together.

2202
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:51,063
And I say to you, maybe--
just maybe--

2203
01:26:51,065 --> 01:26:53,932
that that's the way
it should be--

2204
01:26:53,934 --> 01:26:58,702
a test of our courage...

2205
01:27:00,038 --> 01:27:02,938
Of our compassion...

2206
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:06,741
Our faith in ourselves,

2207
01:27:06,743 --> 01:27:09,343
and our faith
in our country.

2208
01:27:09,345 --> 01:27:12,346
[Applause]

2209
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:21,753
No candidate
can come before you

2210
01:27:21,755 --> 01:27:26,357
and say that he's got
all the answers.

2211
01:27:26,359 --> 01:27:30,093
Crocker jarmon says
that he has the answers.

2212
01:27:30,095 --> 01:27:31,894
[Laughter]

2213
01:27:33,364 --> 01:27:34,363
Does he?

2214
01:27:34,365 --> 01:27:36,231
No!
No!

2215
01:27:36,233 --> 01:27:38,499
[Applause]

2216
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:45,837
All a man can say...

2217
01:27:45,839 --> 01:27:47,872
Is "here I am."

2218
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:49,874
And that's what I say
to you tonight--

2219
01:27:49,876 --> 01:27:54,078
here I am. I'm willing
to give it all I've got.

2220
01:27:54,080 --> 01:27:56,480
Let's make a beginning!

2221
01:28:02,054 --> 01:28:04,320
Tell him we
believe in him!

2222
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:06,922
We want bill!
We want bill!

2223
01:28:06,924 --> 01:28:08,657
We want bill!

2224
01:28:08,659 --> 01:28:11,359
Thank you
very much.

2225
01:28:20,502 --> 01:28:21,968
Oh, hello, Pete!

2226
01:28:21,970 --> 01:28:23,402
Mr. McKay!

2227
01:28:25,239 --> 01:28:26,638
How are--

2228
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,006
how are things
at the office?

2229
01:28:28,008 --> 01:28:28,873
Well, you know,

2230
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:30,174
some of the guys
are down on you,

2231
01:28:30,176 --> 01:28:31,408
but, hell, we knew that.

2232
01:28:31,410 --> 01:28:33,576
Look, I've been there
since the beginning.

2233
01:28:33,578 --> 01:28:35,744
I know what this
is costing you.

2234
01:28:35,746 --> 01:28:37,345
I saw something
out there tonight.

2235
01:28:37,347 --> 01:28:38,746
Believe me, this
is really effective.

2236
01:28:38,748 --> 01:28:40,214
I can feel it.
You can do it.

2237
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:41,381
You can go
all the way.

2238
01:28:41,383 --> 01:28:43,483
You and I both know
this is bullshit,

2239
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,485
but the point is,
they're believing it.

2240
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:47,854
Bill, come on,
the car's waiting!

2241
01:28:47,856 --> 01:28:49,255
Right.
Excuse me.

2242
01:28:49,257 --> 01:28:51,556
It's good to
see you, Pete.

2243
01:28:53,593 --> 01:28:57,328
Ladies...Ladies...

2244
01:28:57,330 --> 01:28:59,463
If we can all
just simmer down now

2245
01:28:59,465 --> 01:29:01,665
and keep our blood pressures
under control,

2246
01:29:01,667 --> 01:29:04,267
Mr. McKay has something
very important

2247
01:29:04,269 --> 01:29:06,535
he wants
to talk to us about.

2248
01:29:16,012 --> 01:29:17,544
Thank you.

2249
01:29:17,546 --> 01:29:20,413
First, I would
like to say that...

2250
01:29:20,415 --> 01:29:22,948
I'm sorry I ate
all the shrimp.

2251
01:29:25,752 --> 01:29:28,552
The unemployment figure
for this state is 8%.

2252
01:29:28,554 --> 01:29:30,420
That's just
the official figure.

2253
01:29:30,422 --> 01:29:31,954
Really, it's closer to 12%.

2254
01:29:31,956 --> 01:29:34,690
The biggest, the richest,
the most powerful country

2255
01:29:34,692 --> 01:29:37,392
can't afford to keep its
full job force working,

2256
01:29:37,394 --> 01:29:40,561
cannot afford to feed
all of its hungry people

2257
01:29:40,563 --> 01:29:42,362
or decently house
its poor people.

2258
01:29:42,364 --> 01:29:45,665
Don't think we can any longer
play off the young against--

2259
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:47,667
black against the white--
rich against the poor.

2260
01:29:47,669 --> 01:29:49,669
It's not gonna be
decided by newspapers.

2261
01:29:49,671 --> 01:29:51,404
It's gonna be decided
by you!

2262
01:29:51,406 --> 01:29:53,572
I say, there's got
to be a better way.

2263
01:29:53,574 --> 01:29:55,307
There's got to be
a better way.

2264
01:29:55,309 --> 01:29:57,042
A better way--
a better way--

2265
01:29:57,044 --> 01:29:59,711
<i> way--way--way!</i>

2266
01:29:59,713 --> 01:30:02,714
Ladies and gentlemen...

2267
01:30:02,716 --> 01:30:05,717
The time has passed...

2268
01:30:05,719 --> 01:30:08,452
The time has<i> passed...</i>

2269
01:30:09,721 --> 01:30:12,454
Got to be a better way.

2270
01:30:13,457 --> 01:30:16,191
I say to you...

2271
01:30:16,193 --> 01:30:18,059
Can't any longer--

2272
01:30:18,061 --> 01:30:20,061
oh, no. Can't any longer

2273
01:30:20,063 --> 01:30:23,330
play off black against old,

2274
01:30:23,332 --> 01:30:25,865
young against poor.

2275
01:30:25,867 --> 01:30:30,469
This country cannot house
its houseless,

2276
01:30:30,471 --> 01:30:33,004
feed its foodless.

2277
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:39,209
Larylarylarylaryl...

2278
01:30:39,211 --> 01:30:40,743
They're demanding
a government

2279
01:30:40,745 --> 01:30:43,212
<i> of</i> the people...

2280
01:30:43,214 --> 01:30:46,348
Peopled by people.

2281
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:50,151
Our faith, our compassion...

2282
01:30:51,487 --> 01:30:54,020
Our courage
on the gridiron.

2283
01:30:56,491 --> 01:30:58,224
[Imitates explosion]

2284
01:30:58,226 --> 01:31:00,492
The basic indifference

2285
01:31:00,494 --> 01:31:04,228
that made
this country great.

2286
01:31:04,230 --> 01:31:06,496
And on election day...

2287
01:31:06,498 --> 01:31:09,098
<i> And</i> on election day...

2288
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:11,233
We won't run away.

2289
01:31:11,235 --> 01:31:14,636
Vote once, vote twice...

2290
01:31:14,638 --> 01:31:17,238
For bill McKay...

What we have in this room

is essentially a bunch
of lazy dilettantes.

we are within 3 points.

2461

We haven't made
many converts,

2462
01:38:19,927 --> 01:38:23,094
but we sure have made
a lot of undecided.

2470
01:39:09,569 --> 01:39:11,101
Nothing.

2471
01:39:12,971 --> 01:39:15,071
An early return.

2472
01:40:19,036 --> 01:40:22,303
[Telephone rings]

2473
01:40:23,639 --> 01:40:24,638
Yeah. Yeah.

2474
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:25,639
Bill, jenkin.

2475
01:40:25,641 --> 01:40:26,439
Yeah.

2476
01:40:26,441 --> 01:40:28,040
What are you,
still in bed?

2477
01:40:28,042 --> 01:40:29,641
Come on. You got
to vote by 7:00.

2478
01:40:29,643 --> 01:40:30,575
What?

2479
01:40:30,577 --> 01:40:32,109
You got to get out
and vote by 7:00,

2480
01:40:32,111 --> 01:40:33,643
or you're not going to
make the afternoon papers.

2481
01:40:33,645 --> 01:40:35,177
What time is it?

2482
01:40:37,314 --> 01:40:38,713
Bill, what do you
think of the weather?

2483
01:40:38,715 --> 01:40:40,314
When are you going back up
through L.A., bill?

2484
01:40:40,316 --> 01:40:41,548
After lunch,
I believe.

2485
01:40:41,550 --> 01:40:43,182
Do you think bill
will take the precinct?

2486
01:40:43,184 --> 01:40:44,550
Pardon, what did you say?

2487
01:40:51,391 --> 01:40:53,391
Walter, it's raining today
on election day,

2488
01:40:53,393 --> 01:40:54,992
all over the state,
we understand.

2489
01:40:54,994 --> 01:40:56,393
And here
at McKay headquarters,

2490
01:40:56,395 --> 01:40:58,995
there's frantic concern
to get out their voters.

2491
01:40:58,997 --> 01:41:00,196
Generally, they believe

2492
01:41:00,198 --> 01:41:01,730
a big turnout
will favor their man.

2493
01:41:01,732 --> 01:41:04,733
Hundreds of volunteers are
going out to knock on doors.

2494
01:41:10,574 --> 01:41:13,908
<i> Crocker jarmon</i>

2498
01:41:19,814 --> 01:41:24,449
<i> Nothing much, but his father</i>

2499
01:41:26,085 --> 01:41:28,185
Good day.
You come with me

2500
01:41:28,187 --> 01:41:29,753
for a minute, please?

2501
01:41:37,896 --> 01:41:40,096
Guess there's no point
in asking who you voted for.

2502
01:41:40,098 --> 01:41:41,363
Oh, you wouldn't really

2503
01:41:41,365 --> 01:41:43,098
want me to say that,
would you?

2504
01:41:43,100 --> 01:41:44,232
I hear it's raining

2505
01:41:44,234 --> 01:41:45,600
in the Southern part
of the state.

2506
01:41:45,602 --> 01:41:46,701
It is?

2507
01:41:46,703 --> 01:41:47,868
It is.

2508
01:41:47,870 --> 01:41:49,269
How do you think
this affects

2509
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:50,503
your son's chances?

2510
01:41:50,505 --> 01:41:52,238
I would think it might help
a great deal.

2511
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:53,505
It'll keep the enemy indoors.

2512
01:41:53,507 --> 01:41:55,641
And it's going to be
a great day for America.

2513
01:41:55,643 --> 01:41:56,808
Kiss her.

2514
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:59,911
That's the best suggestion
I've heard all morning.

2515
01:41:59,913 --> 01:42:01,913
Are those phone banks
working in east L.A.?

2516
01:42:01,915 --> 01:42:02,914
Yeah.

2517
01:42:02,916 --> 01:42:03,981
You double sure?

2518
01:42:03,983 --> 01:42:05,315
Yes.

2519
01:42:05,317 --> 01:42:06,482
Well, check again.

2520
01:42:06,484 --> 01:42:07,950
Is everything all right
at the hotel?

2521
01:42:07,952 --> 01:42:09,318
Don't you have
anywhere to go?

2522
01:42:09,320 --> 01:42:11,920
Look, I have to make sure
that things happen here.

2523
01:42:11,922 --> 01:42:13,321
You're driving
everyone crazy.

2524
01:42:13,323 --> 01:42:14,722
Well, there are
a lot of details.

2525
01:42:14,724 --> 01:42:17,591
Why don't you go
clean your beard?

2526
01:42:27,903 --> 01:42:30,770
Would you mind telling us
who your friends voted for?

2527
01:42:30,772 --> 01:42:34,106
Well, the other people
on my block voted for McKay

2528
01:42:34,108 --> 01:42:35,373
because he was handsome.

2529
01:42:35,375 --> 01:42:37,341
Would you mind telling us
who you voted for?

2530
01:42:37,343 --> 01:42:38,975
Well, I always say

2531
01:42:38,977 --> 01:42:41,644
handsome is
as handsome does.

2532
01:42:41,646 --> 01:42:43,245
<i> I'm talking with</i>
<i> Dr. Benjamin Dwight,</i>

2533
01:42:43,247 --> 01:42:44,512
<i> who in the last</i>
<i> 3 elections</i>

2534
01:42:44,514 --> 01:42:45,746
<i> here in the state</i>
<i> of California</i>

2535

2537
01:42:49,050 --> 01:42:52,751
<i> Dr. Dwight, can you explain</i>
<i> to us the technique you use?</i>

2538
01:42:52,753 --> 01:42:56,154
<i> We pick the key precincts</i>
<i> in Los Angeles county,</i>

2539
01:42:56,156 --> 01:42:59,490
<i> and we interview the voters</i>
<i> on the way from the polls.</i>

2540
01:42:59,492 --> 01:43:01,492
<i> Now, based</i>
<i> on your interviews,</i>

2541
01:43:01,494 --> 01:43:04,361
<i> what is your projection</i>
<i> for this Senate Race?</i>

2542
01:43:04,363 --> 01:43:06,363
<i> Crocker jarmon by 8%.</i>

2543
01:43:06,365 --> 01:43:09,265
8%? What kind
of shit is this?

2544
01:43:09,267 --> 01:43:10,499
The polls don't close
for 3 hours.

2545
01:43:10,501 --> 01:43:13,134
Well, that doesn't
change anybody's mind.

2546
01:43:13,136 --> 01:43:14,535
That doesn't change
their minds--

2547
01:43:14,537 --> 01:43:16,003
they stay home, schmuck.

2548
01:43:16,005 --> 01:43:17,137
Who did you vote for?

2549
01:43:17,139 --> 01:43:18,204
Crocker jarmon.

2550
01:43:18,206 --> 01:43:19,572
Who'd you vote for?
Bill McKay.

2551
01:43:19,574 --> 01:43:21,740
Crocker jarmon.
He takes care of me.

2552
01:43:21,742 --> 01:43:22,741

<i> down in the Southern</i>

01:43:48,331 --> 01:43:49,763

2569

<i> That advantage</i>

<i> by early returns</i>
<i> from the San Francisco area,</i>

2571
01:43:56,403 --> 01:43:58,936

<i> occasionally may be</i>
<i> something to grab and check</i>

01:46:52,040 --> 01:46:53,506
taking your own poll.

2640
01:46:53,508 --> 01:46:55,508
It's a rumor.
Don't believe it.

2641
01:46:55,510 --> 01:46:57,343
Where are you going
from here, Lucas?

2642
01:46:57,345 --> 01:46:58,610
I'm going downstairs
to have a drink

2643
01:46:58,612 --> 01:46:59,644
with a thousand close friends.

2644
01:46:59,646 --> 01:47:00,778
I heard another rumor

2645
01:47:00,780 --> 01:47:02,846
you were headed
for a long vacation.

2646
01:47:02,848 --> 01:47:04,147
No, no, no.

2647
01:47:05,116 --> 01:47:06,181
Lucas!

2648
01:47:07,384 --> 01:47:08,649
Luke! Luke!

2649
01:47:10,319 --> 01:47:11,984
Uh, no comment.

2650
01:47:14,321 --> 01:47:16,220
Hi. I want to talk to you.

2651
01:47:16,222 --> 01:47:17,821
O.K., we'll, uh--

2652
01:47:17,823 --> 01:47:20,490
now. Now.
I want to talk to you.

2653
01:47:32,870 --> 01:47:33,869
Well...

2654
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:34,803
Hey!

2655
01:47:34,805 --> 01:47:37,071
You guys are not
supposed to be here.

2656
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:53,019
O.K. We've got about
60 seconds of privacy

2657
01:47:53,021 --> 01:47:55,654
before they find out
we're here. Now, so, uh,

2658
01:47:55,656 --> 01:47:58,189
what's on your mind,
senator?

2659
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:02,159
I don't know.

2660
01:48:02,161 --> 01:48:03,293
[Knock on door]

2661
01:48:03,295 --> 01:48:04,827
O.K. You got
to get out there.

2662
01:48:04,829 --> 01:48:06,962
I told you they'd be here.

2663
01:48:08,031 --> 01:48:09,597
Marvin...

2664
01:48:09,599 --> 01:48:11,231
What do we do now?

2665
01:48:11,233 --> 01:48:12,298
Wait a minute.
What?

2666
01:48:12,300 --> 01:48:14,233
What do we do know?

2667
01:48:14,235 --> 01:48:16,568
[All talking at once]

2668
01:48:30,583 --> 01:48:32,849
There's a big party
downstairs.
