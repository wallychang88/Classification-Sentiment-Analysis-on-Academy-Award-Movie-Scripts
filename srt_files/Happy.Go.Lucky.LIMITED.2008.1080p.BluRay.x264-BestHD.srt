1
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:19,714
 The Road To Reality.

2
00:04:21,217 --> 00:04:23,635
 Don't wanna be going there.

3
00:04:27,556 --> 00:04:29,850
 Hiya.

4
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:33,061
 An oasis of calm in here, mad out there.

5
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:40,318
 Gorgeous day for it, though, innit?

6
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:45,323
 Never been in here before.

7
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:15,395
 I like your hat.

8
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:41,588
 Busy?

9
00:05:44,383 --> 00:05:46,384
 Hello?

10
00:05:50,014 --> 00:05:51,389
 Having a bad day?

11
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:53,851
 No.

12
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:56,144
 Oh. Not till I showed up, eh?

13
00:05:58,272 --> 00:06:00,524
 Look like a rabbit caught in the headlights.

14
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:01,941
  I won't bite. 

15
00:06:02,776 --> 00:06:04,777
 Don't worry, I'm going now.

16
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:08,364
 Have a good day. Stay happy.

17
00:06:10,492 --> 00:06:12,744
 I ain't nicked nothing. Honest, guv'nor.

18
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:15,830
 Beep, beep, beep, beep.

19
00:06:27,218 --> 00:06:29,427
 Oh, no, no, come on.

20
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:37,894
 That's just brilliant, that is.

21
00:06:41,857 --> 00:06:44,567
 Oh, no, I didn't even get a chance
 to say goodbye.

22
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:56,872
  # You'll never get it right
 cos when you're laid in bed at night 

23
00:06:56,872 --> 00:07:00,209
  # Watching... roaches climb the wall 

24
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:03,378
  # If you called your dad he could stop it all 

25
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:07,007
  # You'll never live like common people 

26
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,302
  # You'll never do what common people do 

27
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:13,097
  # You'll never fail like common people 

28
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:16,474
  # You'll never watch your life slide out of view 

29
00:07:17,268 --> 00:07:20,104
  # And dance and drink and screw 

30
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:22,105
  # Because there's nothing else to do 

31
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,092
 The music's stopped.

32
00:07:50,092 --> 00:07:51,551
 It stopped ages ago.

33
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,264
 Yeah, I was just enjoying the silence.

34
00:07:58,517 --> 00:07:59,893
  What? 

35
00:08:00,895 --> 00:08:02,771
 What's so funny?

36
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:05,648
 I don't know!

37
00:08:07,109 --> 00:08:08,776
 Can you just...

38
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,654
 Oh, your sister's woken up, Poppy.

39
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,992
  Suzy, what's that? 

40
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,244
  What is it? Is that your latest conquest? 

41
00:08:17,244 --> 00:08:19,996
 Oh, bless him!

42
00:08:21,499 --> 00:08:24,001
 Don't you ever pray that you're adopted, Suzy?

43
00:08:24,001 --> 00:08:25,336
 Oh, argh!

44
00:08:25,336 --> 00:08:27,337
 Yeah.

45
00:08:28,506 --> 00:08:30,548
 You got me, Zoe.

46
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,928
 - Ssssh!
 - Who are you shushing?

47
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:36,138
 No, no, no, no, no, no.

48
00:08:36,138 --> 00:08:41,143
 She's right. Let's all enjoy the silence together.

49
00:08:41,143 --> 00:08:45,773
 Dawn, will you shut up?
 Because no-one else can get a word in.

50
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:48,692
  Ssssssh! 

51
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,193
 Sorry!

52
00:08:51,237 --> 00:08:54,156
 - Sssssh.
 - Fingers on lips.

53
00:08:54,156 --> 00:08:55,908
 Fingers on the tits.

54
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,077
 - Fingers on tits.
 - Fingers on the hips.

55
00:08:58,077 --> 00:09:00,036
 Can I borrow yours?

56
00:09:02,373 --> 00:09:05,751
 - Fingers on the tits.
 - Oh, that is properly disgusting.

57
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:07,461
 Chicken fillets. Lunch, anyone?

58
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,380
  - Oh, hello!
 - Can I have a go? 

59
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,841
 Of course you can, Dawn, you don't need to ask.

60
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:14,676
 - Anyone over there?
 - Oh, I know where that's been.

61
00:09:16,387 --> 00:09:18,639
 You have gone down in my estimation.

62
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,558
 I'm sorry, Alice.

63
00:09:20,558 --> 00:09:24,061
 - I don't get why you wear them, Poppy.
 - Oh, don't you?

64
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:27,481
 I mean, you just put them in your bra...

65
00:09:27,481 --> 00:09:28,440
 Yeah?

66
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,402
 I like the way they make me feel, Suzy.

67
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,988
  - Like a natural woman.
 - That's right. 

68
00:09:33,988 --> 00:09:36,532
 - I think it's in the wrong place.
 - Ah, whoop!

69
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:38,325
 Oh, look, you've got three tits!

70
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:40,369
 She's like you, Zoe.

71
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,288
  - No, that's three nipples.
 - Oh, right. 

72
00:09:42,288 --> 00:09:43,830
 Have you got three nipples?

73
00:09:45,332 --> 00:09:50,379
 She doesn't like to talk about it.
 I'm going to give her a little hug.

74
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:53,048
 - Over you go.
 - Oh, that's quite nice. Do that again.

75
00:09:53,048 --> 00:09:55,049
 Oh, really? Oh!

76
00:09:55,676 --> 00:09:57,051
 Ooh!

77
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:03,976
 Your cleavage looks great from up here.

78
00:10:03,976 --> 00:10:05,977
 - Thank you.
 - I've got a bird's eye view.

79
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:09,190
 Come on, ladies, cop a load of this.

80
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:11,066
 Oh, yeah, roll up, roll up.

81
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:12,610
 Look at that!

82
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,237
 - It's good, isn't it?
 - They're amazing.

83
00:10:15,237 --> 00:10:17,155
 Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

84
00:10:19,241 --> 00:10:21,951
 I think we know where Poppy's sleeping tonight.

85
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,254
 Morning.

86
00:10:32,254 --> 00:10:34,255
 Time to get up, sleepyhead.

87
00:10:36,717 --> 00:10:38,718
 Cup of tea here.

88
00:10:39,887 --> 00:10:42,263
 Come on. You can do it.

89
00:10:43,265 --> 00:10:46,684
 That's it. That's it, nearly there.

90
00:10:47,728 --> 00:10:50,105
 Oh, here we go.

91
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:53,107
 - And she's up! Hey.
 - Thanks.

92
00:10:55,402 --> 00:10:56,820
 You all right?

93
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,156
 Yeah, I slept good.

94
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,367
 I heard you.

95
00:11:01,367 --> 00:11:04,286
 You always start that.

96
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,329
 - I don't snore.
 - I know. You never have.

97
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:09,123
 - I don't.
 - I don't.

98
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:19,718
 - Are they still asleep?
 - No, they buggered off ages ago.

99
00:11:19,718 --> 00:11:20,928
 - Did they?
 - Yeah.

100
00:11:20,928 --> 00:11:23,180
 Oh, right.

101
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,932
 - What's the time?
 - About 10 past 12.

102
00:11:27,017 --> 00:11:29,770
 - They've got a bit of work to do.
 - Have they?

103
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:33,482
 - Dawn's late with her dissertation.
 - Oh, no. When are your exams?

104
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:35,568
 - Three weeks tomorrow.
 - You'll be all right.

105
00:11:35,568 --> 00:11:39,029
 Yeah. I'm totally chilled out about it.

106
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,489
 Of course you are.

107
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:42,490
 - I'm cool.
 - Yeah.

108
00:11:43,325 --> 00:11:45,494
 I'm just really stressed.

109
00:11:45,494 --> 00:11:47,745
 What? Like an Eskimo with a headache?

110
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,376
  - Does anyone want any toast?
 - Yeah. 

111
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:54,670
 - Yes, please.
 - With marmalade, two slices.

112
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,213
 Yeah, I know, cut on the diagonal.

113
00:11:56,213 --> 00:11:58,007
 - Yeah.
 - No crusts.

114
00:11:58,007 --> 00:12:01,134
  - Got it. Oh, do you know what?
 - What? 

115
00:12:03,304 --> 00:12:05,389
 - Oh, yeah.
 - She's gone.

116
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:07,975
 The thing is, we're starting with criminal justice.

117
00:12:07,975 --> 00:12:10,436
 - Is that your first exam?
 - Yeah, it's crap.

118
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:15,149
 If we had cyber crime first,
 or, like, crime and pleasure,

119
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:17,568
 I could ease myself into it.

120
00:12:17,568 --> 00:12:19,945
 - No probs.
 - Oh, you'll be all right, Suzy.

121
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:22,823
 Yeah, if we can get a degree, any idiot can.

122
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:25,868
 - You calling your sister an idiot?
 - Calling you an idiot.

123
00:12:25,868 --> 00:12:27,244
 Thank you.

124
00:12:27,244 --> 00:12:29,497
 "Crime and pleasure", now that sounds good.

125
00:12:29,497 --> 00:12:31,539
 - Sounds like last night.
 - Yeah.

126
00:12:32,249 --> 00:12:34,585
 You'll be all right.

127
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:36,753
 Yeah.

128
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:40,758
 - See you later.
 - Alligator.

129
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:43,469
 - When are we going to see Helen?
 - Yeah, when's the baby due?

130
00:12:43,469 --> 00:12:45,429
 Don't know, soon. She's been texting me.

131
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:47,765
 - Me too, she's getting worse.
 - I know, bless her.

132
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:50,434
 - Want to wait till after your exams?
 - I want to get it over with.

133
00:12:50,434 --> 00:12:53,270
 All right. Don't worry, leave her to me.

134
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:57,775
 - Text me, yeah?
 - Work hard.

135
00:12:57,775 --> 00:13:00,361
 Suze... you know it's that way, don't you?

136
00:13:00,361 --> 00:13:02,362
 Oh, yeah.

137
00:13:20,506 --> 00:13:22,800
 - These make good legs?
 - Great.

138
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,801
 # I'm so excited...

139
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,710
 - It would be amazing to fly, wouldn't it?
 - You reckon?

140
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,711
 Just... whoosh!

141
00:14:00,629 --> 00:14:03,507
 - What? Like Mr Vertigo?
 - Oh, yeah. I love that book.

142
00:14:03,507 --> 00:14:04,967
 - Yeah.
 - Oh, vultures.

143
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:07,720
 - Met a few of them.
 - These could be useful.

144
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,598
 Oh, yeah, they're great.
 Oh, look at him, he's gorgeous.

145
00:14:10,598 --> 00:14:12,516
 We could do an owl, they've got big heads.

146
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:15,060
 Good idea. He's got your eyes, look.

147
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,313
 - Cheers, Poppy.
 - No, they're lovely.

148
00:14:17,313 --> 00:14:18,731
 Do penguins emigrate?

149
00:14:18,731 --> 00:14:20,900
 What? Do they move to the Costa del Sol?

150
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,693
 Emigrate, migrate, whatever.

151
00:14:22,693 --> 00:14:25,529
 - What about parrots?
 - Oh, yeah, definitely.

152
00:14:25,529 --> 00:14:28,574
  - Or a toucan. Oh, look at his beak.
 - They're good colours. 

153
00:14:28,574 --> 00:14:30,575
 Beautiful.

154
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,332
 So, are you going to get another bike?

155
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:40,002
 Oh, no, I couldn't replace my old lovely.
 It's flown the nest now.

156
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,046
 Definitely going to learn to drive, though.

157
00:14:42,046 --> 00:14:43,630
 - Going to book lessons?
 - Might do.

158
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,549
 Might not.

159
00:14:45,549 --> 00:14:48,551
 I told you, you're not learning to drive in my car.

160
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,724
 Nutter.

161
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:56,769
 - Chickens, we could do chickens.
 - Chickens don't fly.

162
00:14:56,769 --> 00:15:00,189
  Lazy buggers.
 What are we going to make, then? 

163
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:02,899
 - I don't know. What do you think?
 - I don't know.

164
00:15:05,361 --> 00:15:07,112
 - Where are they?
 - Here.

165
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:10,157
 - That far apart, are they?
 - Yeah. Don't poke me.

166
00:15:10,157 --> 00:15:12,158
 Wasn't going near you.

167
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,621
 - Go on, then.
 - Great.

168
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:24,338
 You should ask an adult to help you.

169
00:15:24,338 --> 00:15:26,339
 I don't know any.

170
00:15:37,184 --> 00:15:40,728
 - I think they're quite good.
 - Yeah, what do you reckon?

171
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,068
  - I think we could pull in these.
 - Definitely. 

172
00:15:46,068 --> 00:15:48,362
 - Pub?
 - Yeah, hair of the dog.

173
00:15:48,362 --> 00:15:51,781
 I'm ready. Put a bit of lippy on and away we go.

174
00:16:12,761 --> 00:16:15,263
  - Hi, Liz.
 - Hi, Zoe. How are you? 

175
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,856
 Ooh.

176
00:16:27,818 --> 00:16:29,819
 Didn't expect that one!

177
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:44,668
 Morning, Tina.

178
00:16:44,668 --> 00:16:50,424
 Birds that live here in North America,
 they fly all the way to South
America.

179
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:51,425
 Yeah?

180
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:54,261
  That's a journey and a half, isn't it? 

181
00:16:54,261 --> 00:16:57,890
 But the... the biggest journey of them all
 is of the arctic tern.

182
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,975
 Because he flies from the Arctic...

183
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:06,689
 Yeah?... all the way - wow,
 across the world - to the South Pole.

184
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:08,734
 Isn't that incredible?

185
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:11,946
 From the North to the South Pole
 and that is... ssh!

186
00:17:11,946 --> 00:17:15,908
 And that is 9,300 miles. That's right.

187
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,951
 Wow, wow.

188
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,878
 All right, Nick, do the other side now.

189
00:17:27,878 --> 00:17:30,672
  Here we go, look. No, don't pull it out. 

190
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,762
 What we can do... Shall we give him...
 Shall we give him a few bits?

191
00:17:39,056 --> 00:17:41,767
 Do you want to give him... I like that, I like that.

192
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:43,978
  - Shall we give him one here?
 - No. 

193
00:17:43,978 --> 00:17:45,103
  No? 

194
00:17:46,564 --> 00:17:49,567
 He's got eyebrows, look.

195
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,568
  - Yeah?
 - Let me see. 

196
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:56,407
 I think that's brilliant. That's brilliant.

197
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,367
 Here we go.

198
00:17:58,367 --> 00:18:00,660
 Shall I put some more yellow in that?
 There we go.

199
00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:03,831
  What colours do you think
 your feathers could be? 

200
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:06,876
 See, you could do a rainbow colour.
 That's a good idea, isn't it?

201
00:18:06,876 --> 00:18:10,921
 - I did a rainbow.
 - Do a rainbow. Rainbows like parrots.

202
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,589
  Don't put that on yet. 

203
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:17,468
  Let's have a look. 

204
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,806
 Little bit more. What about the fringing?

205
00:18:20,806 --> 00:18:23,601
 You could do a bit more
 on the fringing there, couldn't you?

206
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:26,395
 Hungry? It's going to be lunch time soon.

207
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:29,106
 But I'm not a cook.
 It's lunch time in a minute.

208
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:30,733
 We're going to lunch in a minute.

209
00:18:30,733 --> 00:18:32,776
 You can wash your hands.

210
00:18:32,776 --> 00:18:34,528
 Who's ready?

211
00:18:34,528 --> 00:18:36,529
 Hey!

212
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,623
 Oh, wow! That is fantastic. Look at you go!

213
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,753
 Whooh! Flap your arms. Flap your wings.

214
00:18:57,051 --> 00:18:58,468
 Bit dangerous, innit?

215
00:18:59,803 --> 00:19:01,180
 What?

216
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,015
 Putting these over their heads.

217
00:19:03,015 --> 00:19:06,184
 I'm trying to suffocate them.
 That's my goal. Little buggers.

218
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:10,773
  - They look great.
 - How was your weekend? 

219
00:19:10,773 --> 00:19:13,067
 - Crap.
 - Oh, no, why's that, then?

220
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,361
 I didn't do much, just stayed in, really.

221
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:16,737
 It's the weekend, Tash.

222
00:19:16,737 --> 00:19:19,240
  - I know. I had a run-in with my mum.
 - Did ya? 

223
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,244
 Mm. My sister was working Saturday.
 I had to look after Jasmine.

224
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:25,913
 - How is she?
 - That girl eats too much.

225
00:19:25,913 --> 00:19:27,164
 Bless her.

226
00:19:27,164 --> 00:19:31,293
 She ate three chicken legs and four jam tarts
 and then wants to tell
me she's starving.

227
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:32,628
 The little piglet.

228
00:19:32,628 --> 00:19:35,089
  - I dropped her off to my mum's.
 - Yeah? 

229
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:38,884
 I said you've got to tell Sherryanne
 that she needs to put this girl
on a diet.

230
00:19:38,884 --> 00:19:40,469
 You'll give her a complex, she's 7.

231
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:44,139
 All of a sudden Mum doesn't want to get
 involved, for the first time
in her life.

232
00:19:44,139 --> 00:19:47,601
 Then I'm just leaving the house
 and my two aunts arrive from Dollis Hill.

233
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,727
 Oh, no.

234
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:52,648
 So we get the Spanish Inquisition.
 "Tash, you got a boyfriend?

235
00:19:52,648 --> 00:19:56,861
 Are you getting married soon? Why don't you
 give your mother another
grandchild?

236
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:59,238
 You know she nearly 60. She getting old. "

237
00:19:59,238 --> 00:20:00,322
 Aargh!

238
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:03,868
 I was, like, "I haven't got a boyfriend.
 I won't be getting married soon,

239
00:20:03,868 --> 00:20:06,787
 and, no, I won't be investing
 in a mortgage in the near future,

240
00:20:06,787 --> 00:20:08,372
 thank you very much. "

241
00:20:08,372 --> 00:20:10,999
 - Then I just closed the door and left.
 - End of.

242
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,731
 - You cooking?
 - Yeah, are you cooking?

243
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:35,566
 I'm cooking with gas. What we having?

244
00:20:35,566 --> 00:20:37,276
 - Food.
 - That makes a change.

245
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:38,861
 - Are you hungry?
 - I'm ravishing.

246
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:41,197
 - Aren't you just.
 - Thank you.

247
00:20:41,197 --> 00:20:42,573
 How did it go today?

248
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:44,825
 What, with my flying flock of feathered friends?

249
00:20:44,825 --> 00:20:47,036
 Good, they loved it. Flapping away they were.

250
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:48,537
 - Were they?
 - Yeah, bless them.

251
00:20:48,537 --> 00:20:52,124
 I had to nip it in the bud with my lot
 before they flew out the window.

252
00:20:52,124 --> 00:20:53,584
 It was OK, though, was it?

253
00:20:53,584 --> 00:20:56,879
 Oh, yeah, I played them Stravinsky after lunch
 just to calm them down.

254
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:59,757
 - What did you play?
 - The Rite Of Spring.

255
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,634
 I booked my first driving lesson.

256
00:21:01,634 --> 00:21:02,843
 - Did you?
 - Yeah.

257
00:21:02,843 --> 00:21:04,637
 - When is it?
 - 12 o'clock, Saturday.

258
00:21:04,637 --> 00:21:06,931
 Excellent, well done you.

259
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:09,599
 - I'll set the table.
 - Yeah, it's nearly ready.

260
00:21:21,612 --> 00:21:23,239
 Yeah, I know.

261
00:21:23,239 --> 00:21:25,407
  I love the end of the week.
 - You don't say. 

262
00:21:25,407 --> 00:21:26,951
 - I do, actually.
 - Do you?

263
00:21:26,951 --> 00:21:28,452
 - Yeah.
 - Oh.

264
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:31,664
 You know I take this dance class
 on a Friday afternoon, the golden time.

265
00:21:31,664 --> 00:21:34,166
  I swear to God, half the kids are bigger than me. 

266
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:38,587
 - That's not hard, though, is it, eh, titch?
 - No, I don't mean taller, I mean wider.

267
00:21:38,587 --> 00:21:40,047
 You want to be careful, you know?

268
00:21:40,047 --> 00:21:44,176
 You don't want the kids jumping about
 expressing themselves. A bit dangerous.

269
00:21:44,176 --> 00:21:45,761
 Yeah, you do all that on Friday,

270
00:21:45,761 --> 00:21:49,682
 but then they spend the weekend indoors,
 glued to their Nintendo DS.

271
00:21:49,682 --> 00:21:51,851
 Totally. A couple of weeks ago
 I came in Monday -

272
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:54,186
 I told Poppy - sat the kids down for carpet time,

273
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:56,272
 asked them what they did over the weekend.

274
00:21:56,272 --> 00:21:58,649
  Gorgeous weather.
 Not one of them had been out. 

275
00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:01,151
 They'd all been sitting at home
 on their PlayStations.

276
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:04,697
 - You couldn't get them up off the carpet.
 - When they got up, they were wheezing.

277
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:08,075
 - That's pollution for you.
 - We always used to go to the park.

278
00:22:08,075 --> 00:22:11,245
  - A lot of them don't have parks to go to.
 - Yeah, exactly. 

279
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,205
 But you don't need a park to go for a walk.

280
00:22:13,205 --> 00:22:15,166
 If Mum and Dad don't go out, the kids don't.

281
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,668
 Parents are too frightened
 to let their kids play out.

282
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:20,462
 Even a bit of green by the estate,
 they don't let them play there.

283
00:22:20,462 --> 00:22:22,673
 But it's hard for a lot of mums and dads, isn't it?

284
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:25,634
 They've had a hell of a week.
 They're under pressure and stress.

285
00:22:25,634 --> 00:22:28,846
  - Tell me about it.
 - They get back from work, if they work... 

286
00:22:28,846 --> 00:22:32,016
 You know. A lot of them are
 single mums, they're exhausted.

287
00:22:32,016 --> 00:22:36,103
 It's understandable if they don't take
 their kids out for a lovely picnic.

288
00:22:36,103 --> 00:22:39,815
 It's not acceptable. Life's hard, but if
 you want to find a way you find it, innit?

289
00:22:39,815 --> 00:22:42,234
  - Some parents can't be bothered.
 - Yeah, I know. 

290
00:22:42,234 --> 00:22:45,279
 So instead they let their kids
 stay up half the night on chat rooms.

291
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:47,531
 - Yeah!
 - Yeah, that's worrying.

292
00:22:47,531 --> 00:22:50,284
 - Scary.
 - Makes me so angry.

293
00:22:50,284 --> 00:22:53,579
 A lot of seven-year-olds know more
 about the internet than we do.

294
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:55,956
 At least people are talking about it. That's good.

295
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:58,667
 - Is it?
 - Well, yeah. It means we're aware.

296
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:01,337
 I'm aware smoking's bad for me.
 It doesn't mean I'll stop.

297
00:23:01,337 --> 00:23:03,547
  - As long as you know what will kill you.
 - Thanks. 

298
00:23:03,547 --> 00:23:04,715
 Any time.

299
00:23:04,715 --> 00:23:07,885
 I know drinking's bad for me,
 but, you know... I can't help myself.

300
00:23:07,885 --> 00:23:09,886
 - Oh, shame.
 - Cheers!

301
00:23:10,721 --> 00:23:14,849
 Cheers, everyone! Here's to our livers
 and all who drown in them.

302
00:23:15,726 --> 00:23:18,562
 Careful, Poppy, you got your first
 driving lesson tomorrow.

303
00:23:18,562 --> 00:23:20,397
 Oh, yeah, quick, put that down.

304
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:22,441
 You don't want to mess up your blind spot.

305
00:23:22,441 --> 00:23:25,652
 - Oh, that sounds good.
 - Oh, it's here. How many fingers?

306
00:23:33,577 --> 00:23:36,205
 - That must be for you.
 - I'm so excited!

307
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:38,916
 You should do some deep breathing
 before you get in the car.

308
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,794
 Ooh, can't see him. Wish me luck.

309
00:23:41,794 --> 00:23:45,381
 Good luck. I'll keep the emergency
 services on standby.

310
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:48,216
  Any excuse, eh?
 I know what you're like with firemen. 

311
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:54,013
 Hello. Scott?

312
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:57,768
 - Are you Poppy?
 - That's me. Nice to you meet you.

313
00:23:57,768 --> 00:23:59,603
 Right, the car's just here.

314
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:01,981
 They're not infected! What are you like?

315
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:05,943
 They're clean, I just washed them specially,
 honest.

316
00:24:05,943 --> 00:24:07,903
 - This it?
 - You get in the passenger seat.

317
00:24:07,903 --> 00:24:11,448
 - You know it's me learning to drive?
 - We have to talk a few things
through.

318
00:24:11,448 --> 00:24:13,616
 Oh, have we? Fair enough. If you insist.

319
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:19,748
 - Did you choose this colour car?
 - Make yourself comfortable.

320
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:23,169
 - Thank you. Is this your car?
 - No, it's the company's car.

321
00:24:23,169 --> 00:24:25,629
 - Oh, right, what's your car like, then?
 - It is my car.

322
00:24:25,629 --> 00:24:28,048
 You said it was the company's car.
 Make your mind up.

323
00:24:28,048 --> 00:24:30,592
 - Have you got your provisional licence?
 - Yep!

324
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:34,555
 There you go. That's me on a bad day.

325
00:24:34,555 --> 00:24:36,472
 - Is that your real name, Pauline?
 - Right.

326
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:41,145
 - OK, everything seems to be in order.
 - Does it? That's good.

327
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:43,355
 Now, have you ever had
 a driving lesson before?

328
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:47,359
 Yeah. No, it wasn't really a lesson.
 It was in a Cadillac in Miami.

329
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:50,613
 Bunny-hopped down the beach.
 I was a bit pissed, it was hilarious.

330
00:24:50,613 --> 00:24:52,781
 We won't be pissed when driving this car, OK?

331
00:24:52,781 --> 00:24:55,659
 We're not going to bunny-hop.
 We'll focus and concentrate.

332
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:58,370
 I'm going to take you to a spot
 we take all learner drivers.

333
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,998
 - Are you?
 - We'll go through the cockpit drill.

334
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:04,251
 - Oh, naughty.
 - You'll listen and take responsibility.

335
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:05,544
 I'll see what I can do.

336
00:25:05,544 --> 00:25:08,463
 - OK. Put your seat belt on.
 - Will do, Captain Scott.

337
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:12,300
 Here we go, gigolo.

338
00:25:15,054 --> 00:25:17,890
 - So you spoke to the office?
 - I spoke to your boss.

339
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:21,018
 He's not my boss, I work for myself.
 I'm my own man.

340
00:25:21,018 --> 00:25:24,896
 But it's his car... or it's your car... Someone.

341
00:25:27,441 --> 00:25:30,194
 And they told you the price - £22.50 an hour?

342
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:32,029
 That's right. Cheap as chips, you lot.

343
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:34,198
  - We may be cheap but we're better.
 - Are you? 

344
00:25:34,198 --> 00:25:37,368
 You go with the big companies,
 they use inexperienced instructors.

345
00:25:37,368 --> 00:25:38,619
 They don't?

346
00:25:38,619 --> 00:25:40,579
  They've just passed their test and charge more. 

347
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:41,330
 Bastards.

348
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,459
 Us experienced instructors, we go
 with small companies and charge less.

349
00:25:45,459 --> 00:25:48,712
  - That makes a lot of sense, that does.
 - Cheapness is relative. 

350
00:25:48,712 --> 00:25:51,422
 Yeah, it is. You're right. Bang-on!

351
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:55,302
 So, do you want the same time every week?

352
00:25:55,302 --> 00:25:56,512
 Go on, then.

353
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:59,473
 - Do you or don't you? I need to know.
 - Well, if you need to know.

354
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:02,059
 If it's good for you, it's good for me, Scott.

355
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:04,060
 OK, 12 o'clock every Saturday.

356
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:11,485
 - Do you like working Saturdays?
 - I only work half day, Saturday.

357
00:26:11,485 --> 00:26:13,820
 - Oh, that's good.
 - You're my last pupil.

358
00:26:16,282 --> 00:26:20,410
 What do you do for the rest of the day?
 Are you going out tonight?

359
00:26:21,412 --> 00:26:23,664
 I shall go home and read my book.

360
00:26:23,664 --> 00:26:26,666
 Oh, it must be a good book. What is it?

361
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,628
 It's a book.

362
00:26:29,628 --> 00:26:31,838
 Yeah, well, we worked that much out.

363
00:26:38,262 --> 00:26:40,931
 - You see three pedals in front of you.
 - Yeah, yeah.

364
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:44,435
 Will you put your left foot on the left-hand pedal
 and push it all the way down?

365
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,145
 He's a bit frisky, isn't he?

366
00:26:46,145 --> 00:26:48,689
 OK, Pauline.
 Please take your boot off the pedal.

367
00:26:48,689 --> 00:26:52,484
 Nobody's called me Pauline
 since I was two years old. Makes me laugh.

368
00:26:52,484 --> 00:26:53,944
 What am I supposed to call you?

369
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,071
 - Oh, how about Poppy?
 - Poppy?

370
00:26:56,071 --> 00:26:57,573
 - Yeah.
 - Oh, yeah.

371
00:26:57,573 --> 00:27:00,117
 No, whatever turns you on, Scott. I don't mind.

372
00:27:00,117 --> 00:27:03,579
 OK, Poppy. Your boots are inappropriate
 for a driving lesson.

373
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,457
 - What's wrong with them?
 - You can't control a car in high heels.

374
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:10,002
 I can do a lot in these.
 You should see me in these on a dance floor.

375
00:27:10,002 --> 00:27:13,172
 - They may be good on a dance floor.
 - Not just good on a dance floor.

376
00:27:13,172 --> 00:27:14,298
 They are "Oooh".

377
00:27:14,298 --> 00:27:16,175
 They may be good in a Cadillac on a beach

378
00:27:16,175 --> 00:27:19,803
 when you're pissed with your boyfriend,
 but they're not suitable for
driving.

379
00:27:19,803 --> 00:27:20,971
 You're funny.

380
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:23,516
 Now, next week
 I want you to bring flat-soled shoes.

381
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,810
 - I don't look any good in them.
 - It's not how you look, it's how you drive.

382
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:29,563
 I'll see what I can rustle up for you, Scott.
 Leave it to me.

383
00:27:29,563 --> 00:27:30,981
 Right, you see three mirrors -

384
00:27:30,981 --> 00:27:33,526
 your two side-view mirrors
 and your rear-view mirror.

385
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:36,445
 - They make a golden triangle.
 - Is that like the pubic triangle?

386
00:27:36,445 --> 00:27:40,324
 It's a pyramid and at the top of it
 you see the all-seeing eye - Enrahah.

387
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:43,369
 Can you repeat that, please? "En-ra-hah".

388
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,579
 - You talking about the eye of Lucifer?
 - No!

389
00:27:45,579 --> 00:27:47,998
 Cos I don't know if I want to look in there,
 thank you.

390
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:50,918
 It's not Lucifer. There are
 two fallen angels before Lucifer.

391
00:27:50,918 --> 00:27:54,797
 - There is Enrahah, Raziel and Lucifer.
 - I don't have them in my phone book.

392
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:56,257
 - Bear with me.
 - Where is he?

393
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,758
 - Bear with me.
 - I can't see him.

394
00:27:57,758 --> 00:27:59,301
 - It's a teaching tool.
 - Is it?

395
00:27:59,301 --> 00:28:01,554
 Let me explain something to you about teaching.

396
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:05,558
 The teacher's job is to bring out good habits
 in the pupil and to get rid of bad habits.

397
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:08,269
 He does that through
 frequent repetitive thinking.

398
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:10,813
 And he does that by creating clear
 and distinct images

399
00:28:10,813 --> 00:28:12,523
 that are easy for the pupil to retain.

400
00:28:12,523 --> 00:28:14,524
 - Oh, does he, now?
 - Yes.

401
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,778
 Don't worry, it's burnt in there.

402
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:20,614
 You remember. You will remember
 Enrahah till the day you die

403
00:28:20,614 --> 00:28:22,032
 and I will have done my job.

404
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:25,077
 Why don't you have something nice up there
 like a giant strawberry?

405
00:28:25,077 --> 00:28:26,787
 Believe you me, it works.

406
00:28:26,787 --> 00:28:28,706
 - OK, stop!
 - What am I doing now?

407
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:31,292
 Please take your hand off the gear.
 Off the gear stick!

408
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,877
 - All right.
 - Foot off the pedal.

409
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,754
 - I'm not touching anything.
 - Let me explain to you something.

410
00:28:35,754 --> 00:28:38,841
 This car is my livelihood.
 This car is how I earn my living.

411
00:28:38,841 --> 00:28:41,093
 - I don't know how you earn your living.
 - Yeah.

412
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:44,054
 But if I walked into your pub
 or your discotheque or your club

413
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:46,682
 and I walked up to the DJ
 and I scratched all his records,

414
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:48,058
 or I smashed all the glasses,

415
00:28:48,058 --> 00:28:52,438
 and I said, "I'm sorry, I didn't know
 what I was doing," that wouldn't be acceptable.

416
00:28:52,438 --> 00:28:54,273
 There is only one problem with that.

417
00:28:54,273 --> 00:28:57,775
 I don't own a bar or a disco.
 I'm just a primary school teacher.

418
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,114
 - Are you?
 - Afraid so, kiddo.

419
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,118
 Are you a Satanist, Scott?

420
00:29:06,118 --> 00:29:10,080
 - No, in fact I'm exactly the opposite.
 - Are you the Pope, then?

421
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,874
 - That's the same thing.
 - Is it? Does he know that?

422
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:18,088
 Right, you have three pedals, A, B, C.
 Accelerator, brake and clutch.

423
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:19,423
 # Talking about...
 Lovely.

424
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:20,715
 - Good.
 - Yeah.

425
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:23,344
 What's he like?

426
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,095
 - You'd love him.
 - Would I?

427
00:29:25,095 --> 00:29:27,348
 He made me laugh. He was funny.

428
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,433
 What? Like funny "Ha ha" or funny peculiar?

429
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:32,436
 - Bit of both, actually.
 - So, what happened, then?

430
00:29:32,436 --> 00:29:34,855
 - He shouted at me.
 - What? He gave you a telling off?

431
00:29:34,855 --> 00:29:36,941
 He's a little bit uptight. Just a little bit.

432
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,693
 - Bet you wound him up.
 - Might set you up with him.

433
00:29:39,693 --> 00:29:41,737
 - Is he fit?
 - Yeah.

434
00:29:41,737 --> 00:29:43,948
 No, he's not fit at all. Just your type.

435
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,867
 What do I get out of it?
 - You get a shag whenever you want.

436
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,619
 When was the last time that happened?

437
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:53,332
 Who's fault's that, eh?
 Where are you going? Suzy!

438
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:55,376
 - You all right?
 - All right?

439
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,127
 - What's going on?
 - Come on.

440
00:29:57,127 --> 00:29:59,171
 - You shouting at my little sister?
 - No.

441
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:01,298
 - Doesn't look like it, does it?
 - Poppy!

442
00:30:01,298 --> 00:30:03,342
 - Where are you going?
 - Fuck off!

443
00:30:03,342 --> 00:30:05,969
 Not coming with us, apparently. Adios.

444
00:30:08,305 --> 00:30:10,306
 Suze!

445
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,585
 Ooh.

446
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,839
 - Morning, Poppy.
 - All right?

447
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,216
 - What's the matter?
 - Buggered my back, haven't I?

448
00:30:44,216 --> 00:30:46,010
 - Looks like it.
 - Trampolining.

449
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,679
 - Trampolining? Really?
 - Yeah, I go every week.

450
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:50,472
 - What? After school?
 - I love it.

451
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:51,348
 Great.

452
00:30:51,348 --> 00:30:53,392
 You've got to keep the muscles a-pumping.

453
00:30:53,392 --> 00:30:55,644
 - Cos I've just started flamenco.
 - You haven't?

454
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:58,689
 - It's fantastic.
 - I've always wanted to do it. Bit of that.

455
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,024
 - Careful.
 - I'm all right.

456
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,942
 - Come along, if you want.
 - When is it?

457
00:31:01,942 --> 00:31:03,652
 Every Tuesday, 6:30.

458
00:31:03,652 --> 00:31:05,737
 - Well, see how you feel.
 - All right.

459
00:31:12,953 --> 00:31:14,954
 - Morning, Leanne.
 - Morning.

460
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,667
 Stink of urine round here.

461
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:21,045
 - I can't smell anything.
 - Have you peed your pants?

462
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,171
 Yeah, sorry.

463
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,131
 - You're a naughty girl.
 - Tell me about it.

464
00:31:24,131 --> 00:31:25,174
 Ow!

465
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,467
 - You all right?
 - Yeah.

466
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,801
 Come on, we're nearly there.

467
00:31:27,801 --> 00:31:31,180
 - Have you lost your sense of smell?
 - Yeah, smoking dulls your senses.

468
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,473
 - And your brain. Here we go.
 - Go on, then.

469
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,065
 Done that.

470
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,608
 - All done?
 - Yeah, thanks.

471
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:43,859
 OK.

472
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,903
 Take care.

473
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:48,697
 - OK, who have we got next?
 - Poppy Cross.

474
00:31:48,697 --> 00:31:49,657
 Thanks.

475
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,617
 Poppy? No, I'm Zoe. Nice to meet you.

476
00:31:51,617 --> 00:31:54,078
 No, I'm Poppy, sorry about her.
 Don't know who she is.

477
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,996
 - My name's Ezra.
 - Hello, Ezra.

478
00:31:55,996 --> 00:31:58,498
 - You want to just follow me upstairs?
 - Yeah.

479
00:31:59,708 --> 00:32:02,169
 - You're big, aren't you?
 - Good luck!

480
00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:05,089
 - Just take your time.
 - What are you going to do to me?

481
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,466
 Ooh!

482
00:32:07,466 --> 00:32:09,718
 Makes me laugh.

483
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:12,471
 OK, I'm just going to feel the muscles
 in your back.

484
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:14,932
 - Right.
 - And you let me know where the pain is.

485
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,933
 I'll send you a text.

486
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,728
 Strong fingers.

487
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,690
 That tickles.

488
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:28,070
 - Oooh! Bang on the money.
 - OK.

489
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,115
 - Ow...
 - And this side?

490
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,740
 Yeah.

491
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:38,122
 OK. Do you want to reach down to your side
 as if you're picking something up?

492
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,291
 Picking chickens.

493
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,792
 No, sorry. I can't do that. Ow! Oooh.

494
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,551
 Is it your back?

495
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,635
 Sorry?

496
00:32:51,635 --> 00:32:54,470
 Cos it can affect everything, can't it?

497
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,521
 Like your mood and everything.

498
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:10,988
 - Nice action.
 - Lie on your back for me, please.

499
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:14,700
 Must get one of these. Come in very handy.

500
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,160
 Oooh! Ow.

501
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,623
 OK, I'm just going to ask you to roll
 yourself onto your side, facing me.

502
00:33:20,623 --> 00:33:22,248
 You don't ask for much do you, eh?

503
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,668
 I'm going to feel the muscles in your spine again.

504
00:33:28,547 --> 00:33:30,089
 Ooh.

505
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,137
 Oh!

506
00:33:35,137 --> 00:33:38,557
 # What-d'you-ma-call-it,
 ding dang dilly dilly da da, hoo-hoo!

507
00:33:38,557 --> 00:33:40,017
 OK.

508
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:42,185
 All right, lie back.

509
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,272
 There we go.

510
00:33:45,272 --> 00:33:48,067
 There's a joint in your spine that's jammed up.

511
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,360
 Oh, no.

512
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,695
 - Would you like me to release it?
 - Is it serious?

513
00:33:51,695 --> 00:33:54,198
 - It's not too bad.
 - What you going to do? Will it hurt?

514
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,199
 It may for a few days.

515
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,081
  - Go on, then. Go for your life.
 - Are you sure? 

516
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,666
 If you're quick.

517
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:08,878
 OK. I'm going to roll you over and you'll
 feel a short sharp click in your back.

518
00:34:09,922 --> 00:34:13,050
 OK? Breathe in. And...

519
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,095
 Oh. Wait a minute.

520
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:18,222
 OK. Are you ready?

521
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,557
 Yeah.

522
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:21,851
 OK, breathe in...

523
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,645
 - OK.
 - And release.

524
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,231
 Oh, hoochy coochy ga-la!

525
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,816
 OK. Just relax for me.

526
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,445
 Didn't know you were going to do that.

527
00:34:33,445 --> 00:34:35,531
 Ooh.

528
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:37,574
  Just relax and breathe normally. 

529
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,248
  OK, would you like to sit up for me? 

530
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,249
 Yeah.

531
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:55,134
 Will this be a regular occurrence,
 chopping and changing?

532
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:58,262
 - Sorry, Scott. Something came up.
 - I've got a life too, you know.

533
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:01,056
 - I had to make an appointment.
 - Isn't this an appointment?

534
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,892
 I couldn't help it.

535
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,394
 The road to hell is paved with good intentions.

536
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,395
 Sounds like fun.

537
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,442
 Having a bad day, are you?

538
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,195
  - I had a bad pupil this morning.
 - Oh, no, what did he do? 

539
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,280
 He was late, he refused to pay his money.

540
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,907
 He slammed the door and swore at me.

541
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,035
  - You shout at him, did you?
 - I drove off, I'm not teaching him again. 

542
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,454
 - You show him.
 - He's rude, he's arrogant,

543
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,248
 he's overconfident and he's too street.

544
00:35:26,248 --> 00:35:27,416
 You don't like that.

545
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,169
 He's been overindulged
 and encouraged to express himself.

546
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,171
 Express himself! Chop his hands off!

547
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:34,131
  Do you know what it means when they do that? 

548
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:35,966
 - Go on.
 - How little do they know.

549
00:35:35,966 --> 00:35:37,467
 How little do their mothers know.

550
00:35:39,386 --> 00:35:41,221
 And they smell.

551
00:35:42,264 --> 00:35:44,849
 It's not easy being you, is it? Eh?

552
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,655
 Fancy meeting you here, hey?

553
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:02,158
 You don't have to laugh, I'll let you off.

554
00:36:21,136 --> 00:36:22,930
 OK, gently, gently, gently, gently.

555
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,473
 - Steady progression.
 - Sorry.

556
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:27,852
 Take your foot off the brake.
 There's no need to put your foot on the brake.

557
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,229
 - Do you know what's doing that?
 - What is doing that?

558
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:33,148
 - Your boots. Your boots are doing that.
 - No, I was taking my time.

559
00:36:33,148 --> 00:36:35,651
 - I panicked.
 - Your boots, they're inappropriate.

560
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:36,693
 OK, on.

561
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,368
 Poppy, come on.
 Let's pick up some speed. OK?

562
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:47,663
  - Don't shout at me, Scott.
 - Well, don't dilly dally, let's just go. OK. 

563
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:50,374
 - I'm just learning.
 - Next left-hand turn. OK?

564
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,877
 - You panic me.
 - So, mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

565
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,171
  - Gets me right there.
 - Enrahah, Enrahah. 

566
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,132
 Both hands on the wheel, Enrahah. Enrahah.

567
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,092
 I don't like that, gives me the creeps.

568
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,554
  OK, Poppy. Indicate. Mirror, signal, manoeuvre. 

569
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,723
  - Indicate.
 - Signal, OK. 

570
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,058
 - How am I doing?
 - Foot down on the brake. Clutch.

571
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:11,937
 You don't want to stall. OK, find your biting point
 and peep and creep.

572
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:13,939
 - First gear. Peep and creep.
 - First gear.

573
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:16,399
 - Peep and creep.
 - Peeping and a-creeping.

574
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:27,995
 - When you get to the end of the road...
 - Ooh, he's nice.

575
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:31,248
 When we get to the end of the road...
 Can you please focus on the driving?

576
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,417
 Enrahah, Enrahah.

577
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,753
  - Enrahah. OK!
 - I... That's a bit weird. 

578
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,047
  Foot on the brake, clutch. You don't want to stall. 

579
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:41,008
  Find your bite.
 Can you feel you're slightly on a hill? 

580
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,927
 - No.
 - OK, put the hand brake on.

581
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:46,555
 Find your biting point.
 OK, lock your door. Lock your door.

582
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:49,099
 - Don't be ridiculous.
 - Poppy, there's two of them.

583
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:51,101
  - Are you taking the piss?
 - Lock your door. 

584
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:54,939
 - OK, let's go. Let's go, Poppy, let's go.
 - I don't believe you just said that.

585
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,982
 Let's go. On you go. On you go.

586
00:37:56,982 --> 00:38:00,152
 - Let's go that way.
 - Poppy! Poppy, let's go!

587
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,198
 - We're on a bend. Now, let's go.
 - Blimey, O'Reilly.

588
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:07,450
 Right, on you go. Keep to the left
 of the centre of the road.

589
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:18,420
 Usual time next week? 12 o'clock?
 You can check it if you like.

590
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,421
 See you.

591
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,967
 Cheerio.

592
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,974
 All right, doggie?

593
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,940
  Here's another one.
 - Yeah. 

594
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,192
 Circle, completely red.

595
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,819
 What? Like a tomato?

596
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,947
 For instance. White horizontal line.

597
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,615
 Give us a clue, Zoe.

598
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:50,244
 Horizontal, parallel to the horizon.

599
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,620
 Thank you, Miss Marsh.

600
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,166
 - You're welcome.
 - So, it's not... up and down like a yoyo.

601
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,792
 - No.
 - Right.

602
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,460
 - What is it?
 - Vertical.

603
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:00,963
 - No, you muppet, the sign.
 - That'd be "no entry".

604
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,424
 - For what?
 - For black boys on bicycles.

605
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,635
 - Don't get me started on that again.
 - It just popped out of his mouth.

606
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,639
 - You can always get another instructor.
 - Yeah, I know. See how it goes, eh?

607
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,350
 - Ask me another.
 - This is also a red circle.

608
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,686
 - Yeah.
 - Black car - this isn't a racist thing.

609
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,856
 - Glad to hear it.
 - Next to the black car is a red car.

610
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:21,609
 That's Mr Golly overtaking Noddy.

611
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,903
 - Enrahah.
 - Enrahah to you.

612
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,780
 - What is it?
 - No overtaking.

613
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,408
 - Enrahah.
 - Enrahah-ha-ha!

614
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,869
 - He sounds like a nutter.
 - He is a nutter.

615
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,705
 - How's your back?
 - It's all right, actually. He sorted it.

616
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:37,291
 Magic fingers. He was sweet, wasn't he?

617
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,292
 He was fit.

618
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:42,338
 Octagonal sign with "stop" written in it.

619
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,422
 - Stop!
 - All right, then.

620
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,638
 Who's going to blink first?

621
00:40:01,106 --> 00:40:04,400
 - Do you want a cup of tea?
 - Yes, please.

622
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:10,074
 No, you have the lasagna tonight.
 We can finish the chicken tomorrow.

623
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,826
 Look, I can't talk now. See you later.

624
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,038
 - Do you think we'll make it?
 - Depends on the traffic.

625
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:19,707
 Should be all right. Ooh, that's my back!

626
00:40:37,142 --> 00:40:40,354
 Hey, come in, ladies, as quick as you can.

627
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,399
  Do want to put your bags,
 and there's a couple of places. 

628
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:44,733
 - Sorry we're late.
 - Sorry.

629
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:48,904
 No problem, it's very Spanish to be late.
 Take your places. Then we can start.

630
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,905
 Here.

631
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,912
 I was just introducing myself
 to the peoples what don't know me.

632
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,707
 It's lovely to see you again
 and lovely you bring a friend.

633
00:40:59,707 --> 00:41:01,542
 Welcome in my class.

634
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:07,047
 So, my name is Rositta Santos
 and I'm coming from Sevilla in Spain.

635
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,466
 Or Seville, what you say here.

636
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:18,267
  What is famous for our bullfighting,
 our beautiful oranges - 

637
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:23,981
 what your English peoples
 turn into disgusting marmalade.

638
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,650
  Are you going to keep
 those sunglasses on, then? 

639
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:31,822
 And also is the birth home of flamenco.

640
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,406
 Sorry.

641
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,966
 Then everybody is ready... I hope.

642
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,804
  So, feet in parallel. Hip distance apart. 

643
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:02,686
 Pulling up from the waist.
 Opening across the chest.

644
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,315
  Shoulder blades drawing down to the spine. 

645
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,316
 Arms relaxed.

646
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,695
 And taking the head over to your right.

647
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,200
  Feeling that lovely stretch at the neck. 

648
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,080
 Then to the left.

649
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,874
 Not very flamenco, is it?

650
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:28,044
  To the right. 

651
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,214
  Bringing the head back to the centre. 

652
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,050
  And relax. Lovely. 

653
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,055
 So, guys. We're going to reverse the abs now.

654
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,223
 Right foot in front.

655
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:44,311
  Lifting up from the elbows
 like they got strings attached. 

656
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,938
  Like little Pinocchio. 

657
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,898
 Lifting, lifting.

658
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,693
 Keeping the shoulders down.
 Arms above the head.

659
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:54,237
  Framing the face. Here I am... proud. 

660
00:42:55,030 --> 00:43:00,035
 Then bringing the arms down in front.
 Pressing, pressing, pressing.

661
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:04,999
  Keeping the tension,
 keeping the strength, but fluid as well. 

662
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:10,921
 Then lifting up again from the elbows.
 Like the eagle spreading his wings.

663
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:14,340
  Beautiful, angry, ferocious. 

664
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,180
 And, guys, when you're lifting up
 your eagle wings,

665
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:25,811
  remember that this dance comes from the pain,
 from the suffering 

666
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,646
 of los gitanos...

667
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,483
 erm... what you say, "the gypsies".

668
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:33,944
 I know this word not politically correct,

669
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:37,698
 but these guys,
 they been squashed down by society

670
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,285
  for centuries, centuries, and they say, 

671
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,538
 "We don't need this. We got pride.

672
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:46,499
 We got dignity.

673
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:49,584
 We got heart. We got flamenco. "

674
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:54,798
 They say, "This... my space. "

675
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,967
  My space. 

676
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,928
 My space.

677
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,972
 My space. Everybody... do this. One, two.

678
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,933
 My space.

679
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,893
 - And again.
 - My space!

680
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,895
 - Vamos! Vamos!
 - My space!

681
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,897
 - And again.
 - My space!

682
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,191
  - Vamos, vamos.
 - My space! 

683
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:14,151
 - With meaning.
 - My space!

684
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,361
 But, guys.

685
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,529
 My space!

686
00:44:16,529 --> 00:44:18,989
 - One more time.
 - My space!

687
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,534
 - With expression.
 - My space!

688
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:23,702
 - I don't believe it.
 - My space!

689
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,622
  OK, guys. I'll give you two counts in. 

690
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:30,709
  Then we're going to stamp
 and clap the compás, OK? 

691
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,001
  Uno, dos. 

692
00:44:38,968 --> 00:44:43,346
 Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?

693
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:47,768
 Where is the passion? Where is the revenge?
 Where is the blood?

694
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:49,228
 This is flamenco.

695
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,356
 That clapping, so polite.
 It's like the end of the opera.

696
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,900
 "Excuse me, how many sugar
 you want in your tea?"

697
00:44:57,027 --> 00:45:00,865
 This woman been spending
 every Wednesday afternoon for a year

698
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,367
 with your husband, in a hotel in Paddington.

699
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,412
 This guy been having an affair
 for five years with your best friend.

700
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,877
 Your boyfriend, what you gave your love,
 your spirit, for five years

701
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:18,883
 betrays you with a Swedish bitch,
 what is 22 years old.

702
00:45:18,883 --> 00:45:23,053
 You want to kill him.
 You want to cut off his balls.

703
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:27,807
 He's such a bastard! I hate him!

704
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,685
 Are you all right?

705
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,200
 Didn't bargain for that. That was something else.

706
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,784
 I know, but all credit to her.

707
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,037
 She picked herself up. She came straight back.

708
00:45:48,037 --> 00:45:50,915
 As if nothing had happened.
 Like a little fireball, wasn't she?

709
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,834
 - Not a grain of sentimentality.
 - No, wipe the tears.

710
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,544
 Bless her. I wanted to give her a hug.

711
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,254
 I don't think she'd appreciate that.

712
00:45:57,254 --> 00:46:00,132
 No! "This is my space, get off me!"

713
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:03,552
 Leaves a nasty taste, though,
 exploding her heart all over the floor.

714
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,638
 - Then it was "put that away".
 - Stick that in a box.

715
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,515
 - Get it out another time.
 - Perhaps never.

716
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,266
  - You'll be lucky.
 - I know. 

717
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,936
 She must be going through some shit,
 though, mustn't she?

718
00:46:11,936 --> 00:46:16,315
  - She's actually a good teacher.
 - Oh, yeah, definitely. 

719
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,900
 She's going to burn herself out.

720
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,111
 I believed her when she said
 she'd cut off his balls, though. Didn't
you?

721
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,572
 I don't expect the guys will be back
 next week, then?

722
00:46:23,572 --> 00:46:25,949
 No! Snip, snip.

723
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:29,286
 - How's your love life?
 - How is my love life?

724
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,871
  - Nothing doing?
 - Not a sausage. 

725
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:33,290
 - Are you OK with that?
 - Oh, yeah.

726
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,667
  - Good for you.
 - Cheers. 

727
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,543
 Cheers.

728
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,965
 - How's your Beth?
 - Darren's dumped her.

729
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:42,132
 Oh, no.

730
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,510
 Just before her 18th birthday. "Thanks, Darren. "

731
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,720
  - Why do men always do that, eh?
 - I know. 

732
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,140
 Christmas, Valentine's Day.
 Boom! They're gone.

733
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,435
 - I hope he won't turn up to the party.
 - Name off the list.

734
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,480
 I'm looking at her and thinking,
 "Don't call him. Don't call him. "

735
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,608
 - "Don't do it, Beth. Don't do it. "
 - You can't say anything, though.

736
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:03,403
 - You've got to let them get on with it.
 - You can't help being protective.

737
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,657
 Of course, she's got her A levels coming up.

738
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,784
 Fingers crossed, she's going to Manchester.

739
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:11,662
 - Fantastic. What she want to do there?
 - Sociology.

740
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,874
 - Lovely.
 - I hope she'll take a gap year. Travel.

741
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:16,542
 That's important, see the world.

742
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:19,879
 - I think so. Cos I never got the chance.
 - Nor me.

743
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:22,173
 - You made up for it later, though.
 - Didn't I just?

744
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,341
  - Where were you?
 - All over the place. 

745
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:28,304
 Taught in this school in Thailand, six months.
 Me and Zoe.

746
00:47:28,304 --> 00:47:32,224
 Started off in Australia.
 Zoe's got relations in Melbourne and Sydney.

747
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:37,313
 Bali, Java, Malaysia, Vietnam - beautiful.
 Then Thailand.

748
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,148
 Fabulous.

749
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:43,486
 Amazing. Gorgeous kids.
 Loved learning. 60 in a class.

750
00:47:43,486 --> 00:47:44,820
  - 60?
 - Oh, yeah. 

751
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,031
 Fantastic. Great challenge.

752
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,991
  - And for them.
 - Especially for them. 

753
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,033
 Yeah.

754
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:55,539
  - Do you want another one?
 - I'd love to but I'm driving, aren't I?
 
755
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,458
 Oh, of course you are.
 Got to be good. Work tomorrow.

756
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,429
 Poppy, this is your third driving lesson.

757
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:55,099
  - I'm getting quite good, aren't I?
 - No, you're not good. 

758
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,601
 You're smug. You're too easily distracted.

759
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,938
 You're distracted by squirrels,
 by dogs, by children in the park,

760
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,358
 by old ladies in surgical stockings,
 by half-naked men in their gardens.

761
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:07,862
 - Oh, well, he was quite fit, wasn't he?
 - No, he wasn't fit, he had
a paunch.

762
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:11,615
  - I didn't know you were checking it out.
 - Keep your eyes focused on the road. 

763
00:49:11,615 --> 00:49:15,244
 This car is a lethal weapon.
 Pay attention or you'll kill somebody.

764
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,204
 Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

765
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:21,125
 Oh, come on, Scott. How often do you
 see a squirrel sending a text like that?

766
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:25,212
  - Left turn. Mirror, signal, Enrahah.
 - Sending a little text. 

767
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,754
 Enrahah!

768
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:34,013
 I can't believe you're a teacher,
 that you're in charge of 40 children.

769
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,265
 It took me by surprise, to be honest. It's 30.

770
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,642
 30. You have no respect for order.

771
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,770
 You are arrogant, you are disruptive
 and you celebrate chaos.

772
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,482
  - I slipped through the net, didn't I?
 - No, you are the net. 

773
00:49:44,482 --> 00:49:46,650
 Believe you me, Poppy, you are the net.

774
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,862
 OK, we're going to do the next left turn.
 Mirror, signal, manoeuvre.

775
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:53,949
 - Enrahah. Keep with it, Poppy.
 - Oooh. Don't like this corner.

776
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:56,160
 Get away from the bend.
 Get away from the bend.

777
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,330
 Do you remember the pyramid?
 Do you remember the shape of the pyramid?

778
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:00,498
  - Enrahah.
 - No. 

779
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,666
 Enrahah is the eye at the top of the pyramid.

780
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,335
 I'm talking about the bottom of it.

781
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:07,671
 Those at the bottom of the pyramid
 are kept in total ignorance

782
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:10,591
 of what those at the top of the pyramid
 are achieving. Enrahah.

783
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,009
 Where are you on the pyramid?

784
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:15,054
 - I'm outside the pyramid, looking in.
 - Of course you are.

785
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:19,058
 Where are you? That is more to the point.
 Where are you and your children?

786
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:22,561
  - Where are we all, eh?
 - The next left turn. Enrahah. 

787
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:25,940
 - Did you like school, Scott?
 - I'm afraid it didn't agree with me.

788
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,941
 Oh, that's a shame.

789
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:31,529
 Let me tell you something
 about the education system.

790
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:35,074
 - Oh, go on, then.
 - It produces left brain prisoners.

791
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:36,784
 - Do you know what that means?
 - I do.

792
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:39,119
 Well, I'll tell you. Our brain has two sides.

793
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,873
 The left brain and the right brain.
 The left brain... Keep going, keep going.

794
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:45,125
 The left brain is information, data. It's dead.

795
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:48,337
 The right brain is individuality.
 It's where the soul lies.

796
00:50:48,337 --> 00:50:52,424
 And the education system, it works like this -
 "I will give you a world view.

797
00:50:52,424 --> 00:50:55,970
 And if you repeat my world view,
 if you reconfirm my world view,

798
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:59,974
 you will pass your exams and you will
 go higher and higher and higher

799
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:02,560
 and you will become a policeman, a magistrate,

800
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,897
 a lawyer, a general, a politician,
 and you will be happy and you will succeed.

801
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,566
 But if you think for yourself,

802
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,986
 if you think outside of the box,
 then you will be unhappy and you will fail. "

803
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:17,407
 That's how the education system works.
 Left turn. Enrahah. Signal. Enrahah.

804
00:51:19,994 --> 00:51:21,661
 Were you bullied at school, Scott?

805
00:51:24,248 --> 00:51:26,917
 We're going to do the next left turn. Enrahah.

806
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,544
 Kids, they can be cruel, can't they, eh?

807
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,757
 Nick!

808
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:41,182
 Nick, what's going on? Eh?

809
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,225
 Are you all right, Charlie?

810
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,351
 Yeah, I could see that. What's going on, eh?

811
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,441
  Venga, venga! 

812
00:51:53,277 --> 00:51:55,154
  Don't bounce. 

813
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:56,946
  Keep pounding. 

814
00:51:58,908 --> 00:52:00,617
  Facing front. 

815
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:04,913
  Look in front of us. 

816
00:52:07,416 --> 00:52:10,043
  It's not salsa. Keep straight. 

817
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,841
  Venga, mátalo. 

818
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:18,302
  Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres. 

819
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:22,639
  Face the front. Don't look at me.
 Uno, dos, tres. Keep it pounding.
 
820
00:52:23,224 --> 00:52:26,976
 Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.
 Uno, dos, tres. Uno, dos, tres.

821
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:31,856
 Bravo, everybody.

822
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:38,322
 I have to tell you, I am slightly impressed.

823
00:52:38,322 --> 00:52:43,160
 Much better than last week.
 Though of course this is not difficult.

824
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,329
 And still could improve.

825
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:47,540
  But... it will do. 

826
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,833
 For now.

827
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:53,002
  Be quiet. Get on with it. 

828
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,424
  What are you writing about? All about you? 

829
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,425
 That's lovely, Savannah.

830
00:53:01,053 --> 00:53:04,222
  Good girl. Married with a prince, yeah? 

831
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:08,643
 There we are. You carry on
 with your work, there's a good...

832
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,773
 Yeah, you carry on. You draw a picture now.

833
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:15,192
 Hold on. What's going on?
 Can you stop that, please?

834
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:19,028
 What is happening? Are you hurting Ayotunde?

835
00:53:20,531 --> 00:53:23,075
 Are you all right? He hurt you hard?

836
00:53:23,075 --> 00:53:26,537
 He hit you? Come here.
 We do not hurt our friends.

837
00:53:26,537 --> 00:53:29,247
 You come and sit over here.
 Get on with your work.

838
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:34,587
 You were hurting Ayotunde for no reason.
 That's not very nice.

839
00:53:34,587 --> 00:53:36,588
 That's not what we do to our friends.

840
00:53:38,174 --> 00:53:42,178
 - I can't do these.
 - Yes, you can. You carry on with that.

841
00:53:42,178 --> 00:53:44,972
 - Miss, I've got a tiger fish.
 - OK, Chelsea.

842
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,056
 What's happening here, eh?

843
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,567
 You can talk to me, you know?

844
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,654
  Anything you want to say. 

845
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:05,992
 I'm here to help you.

846
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:15,919
 Because I'm your mate, aren't I?

847
00:54:19,215 --> 00:54:21,341
 - Yes.
 - Yeah, that's right.

848
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,469
 That's what mates do...

849
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,681
 ...isn't it?

850
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,891
  - Yes.
 - Yeah. 

851
00:54:35,856 --> 00:54:37,899
 What's making you so angry?

852
00:54:43,197 --> 00:54:45,198
 I want to help sort this out.

853
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,285
 Come on, chop chop.

854
00:54:51,747 --> 00:54:53,748
 - Hi, Jenny.
 - Hi, Poppy.

855
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,711
 - Poppy.
 - Have you got a minute?

856
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:59,755
 - What's up?
 - I think I might have a problem.

857
00:54:59,755 --> 00:55:01,923
 - Come in. Sit yourself down.
 - Cheers.

858
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,930
 It's Nick, really...

859
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,738
 You know what I mean, you know?

860
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,325
 You know?

861
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,326
 - You know?
 - I know.

862
00:56:55,204 --> 00:56:57,498
 It's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's...

863
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,874
 Isn't it just?

864
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:01,334
  You know? You know, it's... 

865
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:06,298
 You know, they, they, they, they, they...

866
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:07,800
 Do they?

867
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,219
 They're not, they're not, they're not, they're not!

868
00:57:10,219 --> 00:57:12,805
 They're not, you know?

869
00:57:12,805 --> 00:57:14,389
 Oh.

870
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,822
 Are you warm enough?

871
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:36,328
 # I know, I said that I was leaving

872
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:39,290
  - That's nice.
 - He's, he's, he's... 

873
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:42,417
  - Is he?
 - You know, he's... 

874
00:57:43,502 --> 00:57:46,296
  Ah, now, and he's, he's... Oh, he's... 

875
00:57:47,006 --> 00:57:48,756
 Oh, no.

876
00:57:49,967 --> 00:57:53,679
 He's, he's, he's...

877
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:55,723
  - What is he?
 - He's a prick. 

878
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:57,849
 Oh! I know a few.

879
00:58:01,437 --> 00:58:03,646
 There you go.

880
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:07,401
 That's it. Yeah.

881
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,944
  - You know what I mean, you know?
 - Yeah, yeah. 

882
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:12,114
  She's, she's, she's... 

883
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:14,825
 She's, she's, she's, you know. She's, she's...

884
00:58:14,825 --> 00:58:18,871
  You know. She's, she's, she's,
 she was, she was... 

885
00:58:18,871 --> 00:58:22,291
 She was, she was, she was, she was...

886
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,043
 - She was so...
 - Was she?

887
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:26,962
 She wouldn't, you know.
 She wouldn't. She wouldn't, you know.

888
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:29,298
 She wouldn't, and I'm, I'm... I'm not, you know.

889
00:58:29,298 --> 00:58:34,803
 I'm not, you know. I'm, I'm...
 She's... you know. She's...

890
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,430
 She's, you know. She's...

891
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,016
 You know, they're, they're, they're, they're...

892
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:42,310
 You know what I mean?

893
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,271
 Yeah.

894
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:48,441
 I do.

895
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,694
 What's your name?

896
00:58:52,822 --> 00:58:53,823
 Hey?

897
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,242
 - Come on.
 - Where are you going?

898
00:58:56,242 --> 00:58:58,326
 - Taxi!
 - That'll be for me.

899
00:59:00,287 --> 00:59:02,288
 Come on, 'sake.

900
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:06,460
 Keep your hair on.

901
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,630
 I've only just met you. Mum warned me
 about going with strangers.

902
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,595
 - Where are you going?
 - Longest way out, shortest way home.

903
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,639
 Oh, sod's law.

904
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,099
 - Is he gone?
 - All right. What?

905
00:59:21,934 --> 00:59:23,935
 - Is he gone?
 - Ease up.

906
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:26,147
 - What?
 - Is he gone?

907
00:59:26,147 --> 00:59:27,523
 You what?

908
00:59:27,523 --> 00:59:30,317
 - Is he gone?
 - Is who gone?

909
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:32,695
 - The rubber knocker man.
 - You what?

910
00:59:32,695 --> 00:59:37,825
 - The rubber knocker man.
 - Oh! The rubber knocker man.

911
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,285
 - Sssh.
 - Why didn't you say?

912
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:42,079
 - Is he gone?
 - Yeah, yeah. No, he's gone, he's gone.

913
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:44,165
 - 'Sake.
 - I see him. He's a-running.

914
00:59:44,165 --> 00:59:46,457
 He's a-rubbing his knockers. He's gone.

915
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,544
 Oh, he's gone. Hang about.

916
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,342
 Oh, there you go.

917
00:59:58,137 --> 01:00:00,513
 Found the en suite, then.

918
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:06,936
 Shake it all about.

919
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:15,361
 What am I doing?

920
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:26,581
 Oh, all done, then?

921
01:00:32,546 --> 01:00:34,047
  All right? 

922
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:53,526
 Have you had your dinner?

923
01:00:53,526 --> 01:00:55,527
 No.

924
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,707
 - Here you are, take that.
 - No.

925
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,545
 - Something to eat.
 - No, thank you.

926
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:25,348
 - Where are you going to sleep tonight?
 - In a bed.

927
01:01:27,226 --> 01:01:29,519
 Of course you are. Silly me.

928
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:41,447
 What?

929
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:57,463
 You know?

930
01:02:00,176 --> 01:02:01,342
 Yeah.

931
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:54,938
 Next, please.

932
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:09,911
  - Are you asleep?
 - Yeah. 

933
01:03:23,342 --> 01:03:24,884
 So what you been up to?

934
01:03:26,762 --> 01:03:29,265
 - This and that.
 - Ducking and a-diving.

935
01:03:29,265 --> 01:03:30,807
 Wheeling and a-dealing.

936
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,145
 - So where you been?
 - Tooing and a-froing.

937
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:36,396
 - Seriously.
 - Seriously.

938
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:39,942
 I went for a walk.

939
01:03:39,942 --> 01:03:42,278
  Thought we were going out for a drink. 

940
01:03:42,278 --> 01:03:44,738
 Oh, yeah. Sorry.

941
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:47,907
 - Left you a message.
 - My battery died on me.

942
01:03:51,829 --> 01:03:55,040
 - So how was your day?
 - How was your day?

943
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:57,041
 Fantastic, the earth moved.

944
01:03:58,377 --> 01:04:02,006
 - I've got a violent pupil in my flock.
 - What's he doing?

945
01:04:02,006 --> 01:04:04,967
 - Being violent.
 - What, is he hitting you?

946
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:07,928
 - He's been hitting the other kids.
 - What are you doing about it?

947
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:09,929
 I spoke to Heather.

948
01:04:11,182 --> 01:04:13,183
 Poor little bugger.

949
01:04:15,561 --> 01:04:17,855
 You've got to love them, haven't you?

950
01:04:17,855 --> 01:04:20,064
 Yeah, otherwise you'd kill them.

951
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,777
 So where did you go tonight?

952
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:27,656
 The eternal question. Where have we been?
 Where are we going?

953
01:04:27,656 --> 01:04:29,657
 What's the meaning of life?

954
01:04:30,784 --> 01:04:33,621
 I went to the moon and then back again.

955
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:36,790
 - Wow, you walk quickly.
 - I've got good legs.

956
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:39,502
 Yeah, you've got great legs.
 Not that you're my type.

957
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:43,963
 - These are great legs.
 - Ah, get off. Read your palm.

958
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:49,719
 Oh, I see a very strong line.

959
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:56,059
 It's your bullshit line,
 and I see a tall, dark, handsome... turd.

960
01:04:57,311 --> 01:05:00,064
 - Next to it is a bloke.
 - A bloke?

961
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:01,816
 - Yeah.
 - Let's see.

962
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:05,611
 Oh, yeah, there he is. Isn't he gorgeous?

963
01:05:05,611 --> 01:05:07,612
 - Not my type.
 - No.

964
01:05:11,158 --> 01:05:13,494
 Where have all the good men gone, eh?

965
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:16,037
 Well, they're not hiding in here, are they?

966
01:05:17,832 --> 01:05:22,001
 Come out, come out, wherever you are.
 We're ready and waiting.

967
01:05:25,047 --> 01:05:27,048
 They haven't got the balls.

968
01:05:34,849 --> 01:05:36,684
 - All right, Nick?
 - Yeah.

969
01:05:36,684 --> 01:05:38,686
  - How you doing there?
 - I'm reading. 

970
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:40,688
 - What you reading?
 - "Yuck!"

971
01:05:40,688 --> 01:05:43,940
 - "Yuck!" That's nice, isn't it?
 - Oh, it's a classic, that.

972
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,319
 - Nick, this is Tim.
 - Hi, Nick.

973
01:05:47,319 --> 01:05:48,070
 Hello.

974
01:05:48,070 --> 01:05:50,364
 Now, Nick, when I asked you the other day,

975
01:05:50,364 --> 01:05:52,241
 did you know what a social worker was,

976
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:53,951
 can you remember what you said?

977
01:05:53,951 --> 01:05:59,165
 A social worker helps you on... hard things.

978
01:05:59,165 --> 01:06:01,959
 A social worker helps you with hard things, yes.

979
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:04,044
 - That's true.
 - Yeah, very good.

980
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:06,213
 That's right. And I was thinking,

981
01:06:06,213 --> 01:06:09,300
 how could I help Tim
 to get to know you a bit better?

982
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:12,928
 I was thinking, because you've done
 some very good learning this year...

983
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,347
 Oh, I'd say so, yes.
 - He has, hasn't he?

984
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:19,267
 And I was thinking, would you mind
 showing Tim some of your work?

985
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:21,937
 - No.
 - That's a good idea.

986
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,397
 I'd love to see it.

987
01:06:23,397 --> 01:06:25,941
 Is that, "No, you don't want to"
 or "No, you don't mind"?

988
01:06:25,941 --> 01:06:28,402
 - No, I don't mind.
 - I didn't think you would.

989
01:06:28,402 --> 01:06:30,905
 Well, that's good, isn't it? What's it going to be?

990
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:33,365
 - You come and sit here. Have a look.
 - Oh, thanks.

991
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:36,911
 - We should show off your maths.
 - Are you good at maths, Nick?

992
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:41,664
 - Are you all right, sweet? A bit tired?
 - Let's have a look at this. Here.

993
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,752
 - What's this, then?
 - Look.

994
01:06:44,752 --> 01:06:47,922
 - This is last term.
 - Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.

995
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:50,466
 Oh, he's good at his numbers.
 - Very good.

996
01:06:50,466 --> 01:06:52,927
 - Yeah, smiley faces.
 - I'm going to see you later, OK?

997
01:06:52,927 --> 01:06:55,679
 - See you.
 - Thanks, Mrs Stockman. See you soon.

998
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,891
 - Smiley face, big smiley face there.
 - Smiley face, ticks everywhere.

999
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:02,936
 - Very good.
 - All last term this was.

1000
01:07:03,938 --> 01:07:06,106
 Isn't it? Not bad.

1001
01:07:06,106 --> 01:07:07,942
 Is it good this term as well?

1002
01:07:07,942 --> 01:07:11,320
 Er... yes, it's a bit on and off. Isn't it?

1003
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,781
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Not so good.

1004
01:07:13,781 --> 01:07:16,157
 - We'll get around that, though.
 - Of course.

1005
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:20,620
 You know you're not in trouble, don't you, Nick?

1006
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:23,374
  - Yeah.
 - Yeah. 

1007
01:07:23,374 --> 01:07:26,125
 No-one could be angry with you. Not for long.

1008
01:07:28,796 --> 01:07:30,965
 You've been a bit angry, though, haven't you?

1009
01:07:30,965 --> 01:07:32,590
 Yeah.

1010
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:37,596
  - What's made you angry?
 - I don't know. 

1011
01:07:37,596 --> 01:07:39,223
  You don't know? 

1012
01:07:39,223 --> 01:07:41,474
 What's it like at home?

1013
01:07:42,143 --> 01:07:43,561
 Fine.

1014
01:07:43,561 --> 01:07:45,980
  - Yeah, with you and your mum?
 - Yeah. 

1015
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:46,856
 Yeah.

1016
01:07:46,856 --> 01:07:49,149
  - You get on with your mum, don't you?
 - Yeah. 

1017
01:07:50,442 --> 01:07:52,862
  - Does anybody else come to the house?
 - No. 

1018
01:07:52,862 --> 01:07:56,157
 No? What about any of Mummy's friends?

1019
01:07:56,157 --> 01:07:58,284
 Has she got a boyfriend?

1020
01:07:58,284 --> 01:07:59,826
 Yeah, she does.

1021
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:04,415
  She does? What's his name? 

1022
01:08:04,415 --> 01:08:05,875
 Jason.

1023
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:07,793
  Jason. 

1024
01:08:07,793 --> 01:08:09,670
  Is Jason nice? 

1025
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,296
 No.

1026
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:19,512
 Has he been making you angry, Nick?

1027
01:08:20,973 --> 01:08:22,391
 Yeah.

1028
01:08:22,391 --> 01:08:24,017
 That's no good, is it?

1029
01:08:26,645 --> 01:08:29,398
 Have you got a piece of paper, Miss Cross?

1030
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:31,567
 Yeah, sure we could rustle one up.

1031
01:08:31,567 --> 01:08:33,944
 - You good at drawing, Nick?
 - Yeah.

1032
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:35,028
 OK.

1033
01:08:38,699 --> 01:08:41,242
 - Here we go.
 - Let's get you a pencil.

1034
01:08:41,994 --> 01:08:43,995
 There you go.

1035
01:08:44,997 --> 01:08:49,542
 Take that, Nick, and what I'd like you to do,
 is draw me a house.

1036
01:08:50,836 --> 01:08:52,213
 Do you think you can do that?

1037
01:08:52,213 --> 01:08:53,881
 - Yeah.
 - Yeah.

1038
01:08:53,881 --> 01:08:55,632
 Thought so.

1039
01:08:57,301 --> 01:08:59,511
  That's your mum, in her bedroom. 

1040
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:02,223
  - And who else is there?
 - Jason. 

1041
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:04,766
  Jason's there. Where's he? 

1042
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,353
  - He's in the living room.
 - In the living room. 

1043
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:12,232
  - You're all in different rooms, aren't you?
 - Mm-hm. 

1044
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:16,069
  Why are you in a different room to Jason? 

1045
01:09:16,862 --> 01:09:20,491
  - Because he's not nice to me.
 - He's not nice. What does he do to you? 

1046
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:22,033
 He hits me.

1047
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,537
  - He hits you.
 - Yeah. 

1048
01:09:26,539 --> 01:09:29,290
  You know that's not right, don't you, Nick? 

1049
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:37,466
 - It was lovely to meet you.
 - Yeah, you too.

1050
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:39,301
 Thank you. I think he'll be all right.

1051
01:09:39,301 --> 01:09:40,719
 - Of course.
 - Yeah.

1052
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:44,390
 - He's got a good teacher.
 - Has he? Where is she? I can't see her.

1053
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:47,268
 - I'm looking at her.
 - Oh. Thank you very much.

1054
01:09:47,268 --> 01:09:51,272
 - I wouldn't mind looking at her again.
 - She wouldn't mind looking at you again.

1055
01:09:51,272 --> 01:09:52,940
 Really? That's good.

1056
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:55,192
 - Give us your number.
 - OK, I'll write it down.

1057
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,193
 That's a start.

1058
01:10:04,577 --> 01:10:05,995
 There you go.

1059
01:10:05,995 --> 01:10:08,706
 - Thank you very much.
 - You're welcome.

1060
01:10:08,706 --> 01:10:10,707
 - Goodbye.
 - See you.

1061
01:10:22,887 --> 01:10:25,264
 Are you all right? Had a good week?

1062
01:10:25,264 --> 01:10:27,265
  - Yeah.
 - Oh, that's a bonus. 

1063
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:30,810
 Smells in here.

1064
01:10:32,229 --> 01:10:34,815
  I didn't know you had a dog. 

1065
01:10:34,815 --> 01:10:37,401
 No, it isn't a dog. I just had a lesson.

1066
01:10:37,401 --> 01:10:39,694
  - Bit stinky, was he?
 - Could say that. 

1067
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,867
  - You got a dog?
 - No, I live in a flat. 

1068
01:10:44,867 --> 01:10:49,205
 Be cruel, wouldn't it? I'd love a dog.
 Have you ever had a dog?

1069
01:10:49,205 --> 01:10:51,832
 - Your mum and dad got a dog?
 - My dad's dead.

1070
01:10:51,832 --> 01:10:53,833
  Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. 

1071
01:10:54,877 --> 01:10:57,213
  - How do you get on with your mum?
 - I don't. 

1072
01:10:57,213 --> 01:10:58,213
 Oh.

1073
01:11:01,675 --> 01:11:03,260
 You live with your mum and dad?

1074
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,221
 No.

1075
01:11:05,221 --> 01:11:07,764
 How old do you think I am, 12?

1076
01:11:09,099 --> 01:11:11,519
  - 22, 23?
 - Oh, I like you. 

1077
01:11:11,519 --> 01:11:13,520
 You can stay.

1078
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:15,940
 I'm 30.

1079
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,732
 Old maid, now.

1080
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:23,572
 So, do you live on your own?

1081
01:11:23,572 --> 01:11:26,325
 No. I live with my flatmate.

1082
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:30,412
 Nearly 10 years now. She done well, bless her.

1083
01:11:30,412 --> 01:11:34,082
 - That's a long time.
 - She's gorgeous. I love her.

1084
01:11:36,585 --> 01:11:38,419
 What do you mean, you love her?

1085
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:43,091
 I mean, I love her. She loves me.
 We love each other.

1086
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:48,763
 What, so you're...

1087
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:51,349
 What?

1088
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:58,148
 Yeah, that's it. That's us.

1089
01:12:02,987 --> 01:12:07,407
 - You got a problem with that, Scott?
 - No, nothing to do with me.

1090
01:12:09,285 --> 01:12:10,952
 I don't think it is.

1091
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:18,419
 - OK, check your mirrors. Enrahah.
 - Yeah, checking, checking.

1092
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:21,338
 Indicate and knock on the door,
 let them know you want to come in.

1093
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:24,800
 Knock on the door, OK. Put your foot
 down on the clutch. Put it in first gear.

1094
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,386
 OK, find your biting point just before you go.
 OK, stop.

1095
01:12:27,386 --> 01:12:29,138
 - What?
 - Put the car in neutral.

1096
01:12:29,138 --> 01:12:31,140
 Put the car in neutral, the hand brake on.

1097
01:12:31,140 --> 01:12:34,810
 Take your hand off the steering wheel,
 foot off the pedal, turn off the ignition.

1098
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:36,770
  - I haven't started.
 - I've stopped. 

1099
01:12:36,770 --> 01:12:39,315
 - Now you tell me why I've stopped.
 - Got a headache?

1100
01:12:39,315 --> 01:12:42,359
 No. Yes! I have got a headache
 and you tell me why I've got one.

1101
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:46,447
 Erm... I don't know. Time of the month?
 Oh, give me a clue.

1102
01:12:46,447 --> 01:12:48,823
 Well, think. Top to toe. Top to toe.

1103
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:51,952
  - Boots, Poppy. Boots.
 - Oh, here we go. 

1104
01:12:51,952 --> 01:12:54,997
 Every week I ask you,
 "Please wear appropriate footwear. "

1105
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:57,666
 And every week you insist
 on wearing those stupid boots.

1106
01:12:57,666 --> 01:13:00,002
  - Yeah, sorry about that.
 - You know what this is? 

1107
01:13:00,002 --> 01:13:02,087
  - This is vanity before safety.
 - Oh, right. 

1108
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:05,090
 "I'm sorry, Mrs Jones. I'm sorry.
 Poppy killed your child,

1109
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:08,427
 but don't worry, she looked really cool
 in her sexy, seductive boots. "

1110
01:13:08,427 --> 01:13:10,471
  - Am I keeping you awake at night?
 - No. 

1111
01:13:10,471 --> 01:13:11,846
 Are you sure about that?

1112
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:14,558
 Shall we get on with the lesson?

1113
01:13:14,558 --> 01:13:16,477
 Will you do something about your boots?

1114
01:13:16,477 --> 01:13:19,980
 I don't think so. They're fine. I'm comfy in these.

1115
01:13:19,980 --> 01:13:22,190
 A lot of people drive in heels.

1116
01:13:23,192 --> 01:13:25,277
 Very well, on your head be it.

1117
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:27,111
 Yeah, okey-dokey.

1118
01:13:35,246 --> 01:13:38,541
 Keep to the left of the centre. Enrahah. Enrahah.

1119
01:13:38,541 --> 01:13:40,417
 When we come to this bend, what do we do?

1120
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:43,796
  - Are you expecting the worst?
 - We keep to the left. 

1121
01:13:43,796 --> 01:13:45,422
  We expect a juggernaut, OK? 

1122
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:47,633
 - Expect the worst.
 - Expecting the worst.

1123
01:13:47,633 --> 01:13:49,885
  - More gas, more gas.
 - Expecting the worst. 

1124
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:51,345
  - Expecting the worst.
 - More gas. 

1125
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:54,640
 - There's a juggernaut, get down!
 - Poppy, put both hands on the wheel

1126
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,517
 and keep your eyes on the road!

1127
01:13:56,517 --> 01:13:59,353
 - There was a juggernaut, Scott.
 - There wasn't a juggernaut.

1128
01:13:59,353 --> 01:14:02,231
 - That was a stupid thing to do, Poppy.
 - There was a little...

1129
01:14:02,231 --> 01:14:04,483
 - Give me gas. Give me gas.
 - I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1130
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:06,693
 - I'm giving you gas.
 - Away from the bend. Give me gas.

1131
01:14:13,534 --> 01:14:14,368
 Right.

1132
01:14:14,368 --> 01:14:16,287
  - Poppy.
 - Yeah? 

1133
01:14:16,287 --> 01:14:19,039
 I am not going to allow you
 to endanger both of us,

1134
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:21,125
 just for you to have your stupid little joke.

1135
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:24,545
  I mean, if you want to make jokes,
 if that's what you want to do, 

1136
01:14:24,545 --> 01:14:27,464
 then I will gladly sit here
 and you can take the mickey out of me

1137
01:14:27,464 --> 01:14:29,758
 for £22.50 an hour - it's your money.

1138
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:32,845
  - I'm big enough. I can take it.
 - Can you? 

1139
01:14:32,845 --> 01:14:35,973
 But I will not allow you
 to endanger yourself, myself,

1140
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,517
 and other road users just for your amusement.

1141
01:14:38,517 --> 01:14:40,144
 I wasn't taking the mickey, Scott.

1142
01:14:40,144 --> 01:14:42,771
  - I'm sorry.
 - Don't touch me! Don't you touch me! 

1143
01:14:42,771 --> 01:14:45,733
 Right, that's it. Get out!

1144
01:14:45,733 --> 01:14:48,444
 - What's happening now?
 - Get in the passenger seat.

1145
01:14:48,444 --> 01:14:51,613
 - Why?
 - The lesson is over. I'm taking you home.

1146
01:14:53,199 --> 01:14:56,201
 Oh. So, that's that, then, is it?

1147
01:14:56,994 --> 01:14:58,244
  All right, then. 

1148
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:08,129
 Speak to the office and when they ask you,
 tell them I can't teach you.

1149
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:14,804
 Fucking!

1150
01:15:14,804 --> 01:15:17,680
 Take it easy, Scott. It's all right. It's all right.

1151
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:30,527
 Well, come on, then. Let's go.
 It's costing me enough money as it is.

1152
01:15:32,196 --> 01:15:36,115
 All I ask is that you behave like an adult.

1153
01:15:37,493 --> 01:15:39,619
 What? Like you, Scott?

1154
01:15:45,501 --> 01:15:47,210
 It's like musical cars, this.

1155
01:15:49,129 --> 01:15:52,383
 - What now?
 - Get in the driver's seat, please.

1156
01:15:52,383 --> 01:15:54,342
 I've never given up on a pupil.

1157
01:15:56,053 --> 01:16:01,349
 Oh, so that bit's over, is it?
 Oh, well, make your mind up.

1158
01:16:02,143 --> 01:16:05,187
 Do you want to have a walk,
 get a breath of fresh air or something?

1159
01:16:05,187 --> 01:16:07,188
 No? All right, then.

1160
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:16,823
 Check your mirrors.

1161
01:16:22,371 --> 01:16:26,207
 What about that guy you gave up on
 the other week, eh?

1162
01:16:27,293 --> 01:16:29,461
 He passed his test this morning.

1163
01:16:29,461 --> 01:16:32,965
  - Oh, well, that's good.
 - He didn't deserve to. 

1164
01:16:32,965 --> 01:16:35,467
 He was very rude.
 He didn't even say thank you.

1165
01:16:35,467 --> 01:16:40,097
 I don't know, some people. Doesn't take much.

1166
01:16:40,097 --> 01:16:42,223
  - It's just the little things.
 - That's right. 

1167
01:16:43,184 --> 01:16:45,019
 Enrahah.

1168
01:16:45,019 --> 01:16:47,187
 Keep to the left of the centre of the road.

1169
01:16:49,273 --> 01:16:53,610
 You can make jokes while you're driving,
 but you will crash and you will die laughing.

1170
01:16:55,029 --> 01:16:58,072
 Well, if you're going to go,
 it's the best way to go, I suppose.

1171
01:17:01,118 --> 01:17:03,662
  - Are you scared of death?
 - No, I'm not scared of death. 

1172
01:17:03,662 --> 01:17:06,373
 I'm scared of dying. That's why I woke up.

1173
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:08,501
  - Oh, when did you wake up?
 - A long time ago. 

1174
01:17:08,501 --> 01:17:10,002
  - Who set the alarm?
 - I did. 

1175
01:17:10,002 --> 01:17:12,463
  - I opened my eyes and I saw.
 - And what did you see? 

1176
01:17:12,463 --> 01:17:16,467
 You can laugh while Rome is burning,
 but believe you me, Poppy, it is burning.

1177
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:20,386
 And if you don't wake up,
 then you will be burnt to a cinder.

1178
01:17:22,264 --> 01:17:25,935
  I mean, look around you. What do you see?
 Do you see happiness? 

1179
01:17:25,935 --> 01:17:29,688
 Do you see a policy of bringing
 happiness to people? No. No.

1180
01:17:29,688 --> 01:17:31,607
 You see ignorance and fear.

1181
01:17:31,607 --> 01:17:34,568
 You see... You see the disease
 of multiculturalism,

1182
01:17:34,568 --> 01:17:36,278
 and what is multiculturalism?

1183
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:38,614
 Multiculturalism is non-culturalism.

1184
01:17:38,614 --> 01:17:40,533
 And why do they want non-culturalism?

1185
01:17:40,533 --> 01:17:43,118
 Because they want to reduce collective will.

1186
01:17:43,118 --> 01:17:44,787
 The American Dream never happened.

1187
01:17:44,787 --> 01:17:46,747
 The American nightmare is already here.

1188
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:48,290
 Look at the Washington Monument.

1189
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:52,127
 It is 555 feet above the ground
 and 111 feet below the ground.

1190
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:56,173
 555 plus 111 is 666.

1191
01:17:56,173 --> 01:17:59,134
 666, Poppy. 666.

1192
01:18:03,889 --> 01:18:06,308
  Keep to the left of the centre of the road. 

1193
01:18:06,308 --> 01:18:08,852
 Are you an only child, Scott?

1194
01:18:12,773 --> 01:18:16,569
 Enrahah. Use all your mirrors.

1195
01:18:16,569 --> 01:18:18,570
 Watch your speed.

1196
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,215
 Same time next week?

1197
01:18:40,593 --> 01:18:42,886
 - Of course.
 - Of course.

1198
01:18:47,308 --> 01:18:48,683
 Stay happy.

1199
01:19:06,452 --> 01:19:09,955
 - Oh, come on, Suzy.
 - Don't worry, she'll be here.

1200
01:19:09,955 --> 01:19:11,999
 What time's Helen expecting us?

1201
01:19:11,999 --> 01:19:15,294
 - She wanted us there by four.
 - She's going to go nuts.

1202
01:19:15,294 --> 01:19:18,506
 Not much I can do about that. Runs in the family.

1203
01:19:18,506 --> 01:19:20,131
 How was your lesson?

1204
01:19:21,467 --> 01:19:24,595
 I don't know. Dark.

1205
01:19:24,595 --> 01:19:28,181
 - How do you mean, dark?
 - Dark as the night.

1206
01:19:28,891 --> 01:19:31,811
 He hasn't been feeling you up, has he?

1207
01:19:31,811 --> 01:19:33,771
 I'd like to see him try.

1208
01:19:33,771 --> 01:19:36,982
  Touching your knee instead of the gear stick,
 that old chestnut. 

1209
01:19:36,982 --> 01:19:38,818
 No.

1210
01:19:38,818 --> 01:19:40,944
 You all right, Poppy?

1211
01:19:42,613 --> 01:19:45,407
 Yeah. I think I'm just worried about Helen.

1212
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,827
 Really, how do you mean?

1213
01:19:47,827 --> 01:19:50,746
 - Should have gone to see her ages ago.
 - Yeah, families, eh?

1214
01:19:50,746 --> 01:19:52,497
  Oh, here's Suzy. 

1215
01:20:54,059 --> 01:20:55,810
 Here we are.

1216
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:10,284
 - Hello!
 - Are you all right?

1217
01:21:10,284 --> 01:21:13,286
 Look at this! Oh, mind the tree.

1218
01:21:14,663 --> 01:21:16,665
 - It's nice to stand up.
 - All right, Poppy?

1219
01:21:16,665 --> 01:21:19,668
  - All right, Jamie?
 - Suzy, mind your sister's new motor. 

1220
01:21:19,668 --> 01:21:21,545
  - You all right, Jamie?
 - All right? 

1221
01:21:21,545 --> 01:21:23,506
 - Yeah.
 - Long time no see.

1222
01:21:23,506 --> 01:21:25,925
 - Yeah, long time no see.
 - All right, Suzy?

1223
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:27,968
  - All right, Jamie?
 - All right. 

1224
01:21:27,968 --> 01:21:30,513
 Ooh, these are for you.

1225
01:21:30,513 --> 01:21:35,351
 - I got you a little bottle of bubbly.
 - Oh, thank you very much. It's lovely.

1226
01:21:35,351 --> 01:21:39,522
 - All right. I'll pop these upstairs for you.
 - Lovely, Jamie. Thank
you very much.

1227
01:21:39,522 --> 01:21:42,483
 - Isn't that lovely?
 - I'm guessing we're having a barbecue.

1228
01:21:42,483 --> 01:21:44,484
 Whatever gave you that idea, Suze?

1229
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:47,905
 - Keep on running, Jamie.
 - Yeah.

1230
01:21:47,905 --> 01:21:51,283
 Better put these down now, shall I?
 That's a good idea. Having fun yet?

1231
01:21:51,283 --> 01:21:53,202
  - Yeah.
 - Take your shoes off, Suzy. 

1232
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:55,204
  - All right!
 - And you too, Poppy. 

1233
01:21:55,204 --> 01:21:58,207
 I'll give you the grand tour.
 This is the downstairs toilet.

1234
01:21:58,207 --> 01:22:00,543
 - Oh, I thought it was the wine cellar.
 - I wish.

1235
01:22:00,543 --> 01:22:03,379
 Through here, this is the living room.

1236
01:22:03,379 --> 01:22:06,882
 Ta-da! Yeah, went with
 a blue and silver theme in here.

1237
01:22:06,882 --> 01:22:09,051
 Did you, Jamie? It's very nice, isn't it, Suze?

1238
01:22:09,051 --> 01:22:11,137
 - Here's our dining area.
 - Lovely.

1239
01:22:11,137 --> 01:22:14,473
 There's usually another chair here.
 But we put it outside for later.

1240
01:22:14,473 --> 01:22:15,808
 - For the foxes?
 - Yeah!

1241
01:22:15,808 --> 01:22:18,519
 - We only got it last weekend, didn't we?
 - Yeah, flat pack.

1242
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:19,602
 Really?

1243
01:22:22,648 --> 01:22:26,944
 It's beautiful, Helen.
 Haven't you got green fingers, eh?

1244
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:29,196
  - Is it all right to smoke, Helen?
 - I suppose so. 

1245
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:31,407
 Can you get the ash in the ashtray, please?

1246
01:22:31,407 --> 01:22:33,033
  I'll try not to miss the potty. 

1247
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:35,202
  - You've been trained.
 - Come and see my roses! 

1248
01:22:35,202 --> 01:22:38,330
 - Oh, lovely.
 - I only planted these this time last year.

1249
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:40,624
 - You didn't.
 - They've done really well.

1250
01:22:40,624 --> 01:22:42,751
 I want to grow them into a big bush.

1251
01:22:42,751 --> 01:22:44,587
 - They smell lovely.
 - Don't they just.

1252
01:22:44,587 --> 01:22:46,422
 My lavender. Put that by the compost.

1253
01:22:46,422 --> 01:22:50,092
 - Best place for it, really.
 - Hydrangeas need perking up a bit.

1254
01:22:50,092 --> 01:22:51,760
 Bit down in the dumps, is he?

1255
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:54,263
 Hello there, cheer up. Might never happen.

1256
01:22:54,263 --> 01:22:57,057
 Busy Lizzies are doing very well.
 Beautiful flowers.

1257
01:22:57,057 --> 01:23:00,102
 - Been a bit busy, has she?
 - Going to plant more of these next year.

1258
01:23:00,102 --> 01:23:02,229
 - That looks crap.
 - Thanks, Suzy.

1259
01:23:02,229 --> 01:23:04,231
 - Eucalyptus.
 - Oh, Zoe.

1260
01:23:04,231 --> 01:23:06,233
 Gum tree!

1261
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:08,819
 - Brings back memories, doesn't it?
 - Yeah, the smell.

1262
01:23:08,819 --> 01:23:10,613
 G'day, blue, how's it going?

1263
01:23:10,613 --> 01:23:13,574
 - Drinks up.
 - Cheers, Jamie. Let me give you a hand.

1264
01:23:13,574 --> 01:23:16,201
 - Cheers, everyone.
 - Cheers.

1265
01:23:18,621 --> 01:23:20,206
 So, you've spoken to Mum, then?

1266
01:23:20,206 --> 01:23:22,583
 Yeah, I spoke to her last Sunday. She's all right.

1267
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:24,668
 - Lovely. She coming down?
 - Yes.

1268
01:23:24,668 --> 01:23:26,629
 What's she coming down with? Syphilis?

1269
01:23:26,629 --> 01:23:29,256
 - When did you last speak to her, Suzy?
 - Oh, leave it out.

1270
01:23:29,256 --> 01:23:31,300
 - You should give her a ring.
 - I spoke to her.

1271
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:33,177
 - They're very excited.
 - Course they are.

1272
01:23:33,177 --> 01:23:34,845
 They'll come down when the baby's born.

1273
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:38,432
 - Get on with the in-laws, do you, Jamie?
 - Yeah, I do, as it goes.

1274
01:23:38,432 --> 01:23:41,811
 - Yeah, you get on with Dad, don't you?
 - We have a nice chat from time to time.

1275
01:23:41,811 --> 01:23:43,979
 - Do you?
 - That's more than we ever do.

1276
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:46,607
 Does it seem funny,
 your little sister having a baby?

1277
01:23:46,607 --> 01:23:49,401
 - Yeah, it is a bit weird.
 - No, it's perfectly natural.

1278
01:23:49,401 --> 01:23:51,612
 - I'm an auntie.
 - Oh, yeah?

1279
01:23:51,612 --> 01:23:54,323
 - Got two nieces. My brothers' kids.
 - They're lovely.

1280
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:57,284
 - Yeah, well, they're all right.
 - Oh, he's kicking.

1281
01:23:57,284 --> 01:24:02,122
 Oh, yeah, that's amazing. Hello,
 little man in there. It's your auntie speaking.

1282
01:24:02,122 --> 01:24:05,167
 There's your other auntie here, Auntie Suzy.
 Does she want a word?

1283
01:24:05,167 --> 01:24:08,170
 - What are you going to call it?
 - Yeah, have you chosen a name yet?

1284
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:11,173
 - We weren't going to say, were we?
 - We're not telling anyone yet.

1285
01:24:11,173 --> 01:24:13,759
 - Go on, your secret's safe with us.
 - No, it's bad luck.

1286
01:24:13,759 --> 01:24:15,219
 It's Nathan.

1287
01:24:15,219 --> 01:24:17,847
 Oops. It's lovely.

1288
01:24:17,847 --> 01:24:19,765
 - Nathan?
 - Yeah.

1289
01:24:19,765 --> 01:24:22,852
 - It's a lovely name, Helen.
 - Is there a Nathan in the family?

1290
01:24:22,852 --> 01:24:25,855
 - No.
 - No, just feels right to us.

1291
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:27,982
 Well, that's the important thing.

1292
01:24:27,982 --> 01:24:31,110
 - Nathan Lightfoot.
 - Yes, Suzy, Nathan Lightfoot.

1293
01:24:31,110 --> 01:24:32,862
 Nathan Lightfoot Esquire.

1294
01:24:32,862 --> 01:24:34,864
 - It's boring.
 - Take no notice of her.

1295
01:24:34,864 --> 01:24:37,157
 - I'm not.
 - Cheers. Cheers, Nathan.

1296
01:24:38,450 --> 01:24:41,286
 - Let me get you another top up. Suzy?
 - Oh, yeah, thanks, Jamie.

1297
01:24:45,791 --> 01:24:48,377
 I know, let's have a go on your PlayStation,
 Jamie.

1298
01:24:48,377 --> 01:24:49,712
  - Yeah.
 - Yeah. 

1299
01:24:49,712 --> 01:24:52,089
 - Yeah, I'll start it up.
 - No, Jamie.

1300
01:24:52,089 --> 01:24:54,924
 - Zoe's favourite, isn't it?
 - Yeah, I can't get enough.

1301
01:24:56,010 --> 01:24:58,971
 - What games you got?
 - Sonic The Hedgehog, Splinter Cell.

1302
01:24:58,971 --> 01:25:00,848
  - Cool.
 - We can't start with that now. 

1303
01:25:00,848 --> 01:25:02,224
 - Why not?
 - It's too late.

1304
01:25:02,224 --> 01:25:03,851
 Is it? What's the time?

1305
01:25:03,851 --> 01:25:05,853
  - Oh, five minutes.
 - No. 

1306
01:25:05,853 --> 01:25:08,314
  - Come on, let's play.
 - Jamie, I said leave it. 

1307
01:25:08,314 --> 01:25:10,316
 - All right, lovely.
 - Sit down.

1308
01:25:10,316 --> 01:25:12,317
 Oh, for fuck sake.

1309
01:25:20,493 --> 01:25:22,912
 Bane of my life, PlayStations.

1310
01:25:22,912 --> 01:25:24,997
 - Oh, you got one?
 - No, the kids at school.

1311
01:25:24,997 --> 01:25:27,458
 They're like that under the desks, aren't they?

1312
01:25:27,458 --> 01:25:29,710
 - I always confiscate them in my class.
 - Do you?

1313
01:25:29,710 --> 01:25:31,837
  - What a surprise.
 - They must love that. 

1314
01:25:31,837 --> 01:25:35,507
 - Well, maybe in the morning, eh?
 - Yeah, before we go for a walk.

1315
01:25:37,259 --> 01:25:40,554
 It's incredible to think
 I'm going to get even bigger.

1316
01:25:40,554 --> 01:25:43,349
 - Only 10 more weeks.
 - Exciting, strap yourself in.

1317
01:25:43,349 --> 01:25:46,310
 Doesn't it make you both feel
 a little bit broody, you girls?

1318
01:25:46,310 --> 01:25:49,980
 - No, actually. How about you, Zoe?
 - Afraid not. With all due respect.

1319
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,941
 You want a baby, though, don't you, Poppy?

1320
01:25:51,941 --> 01:25:55,236
 - No, thanks. I've just had a kebab.
 - I didn't mean that. Eventually.

1321
01:25:55,236 --> 01:25:56,612
 Maybe. Who knows?

1322
01:25:56,612 --> 01:25:58,906
 At 35, you're considered a high-risk mum.

1323
01:25:58,906 --> 01:26:02,159
 - Give me a chance, I've just turned 30.
 - It's only five years away.

1324
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:04,912
 - You've got to make plans.
 - A five-year plan? Like Stalin?

1325
01:26:04,912 --> 01:26:07,998
 - When are you getting on the property ladder?
 - I need a step up first.

1326
01:26:07,998 --> 01:26:11,126
 - You got to get yourself a mortgage.
 - We don't want the hassle.

1327
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:14,588
 - You need to invest your savings.
 - I just stuff mine under the mattress.

1328
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:17,299
 - Have you got a pension yet?
 - You got to be joking.

1329
01:26:17,299 --> 01:26:20,177
 - Have you got a pension?
 - We've both got pensions, haven't we?

1330
01:26:20,177 --> 01:26:23,097
 - Oh, yeah.
 - Great. Where are your Zimmer frames?

1331
01:26:23,097 --> 01:26:25,266
 - You've got to take life seriously.
 - Have I?

1332
01:26:25,266 --> 01:26:28,435
 You can't get drunk every night, partying,
 however much fun it is.

1333
01:26:28,435 --> 01:26:30,563
 I don't get drunk every night. Do we?

1334
01:26:30,563 --> 01:26:33,983
 - No, she's an adult now, your big sister.
 - Unfortunately.

1335
01:26:33,983 --> 01:26:36,861
 - You have to take responsibility, Poppy.
 - OK, take it easy.

1336
01:26:36,861 --> 01:26:39,071
 I am taking it easy.

1337
01:26:39,071 --> 01:26:40,948
 I just want you to be happy, that's all.

1338
01:26:40,948 --> 01:26:42,449
 I am happy.

1339
01:26:42,449 --> 01:26:44,201
 - I don't think you are.
 - I am.

1340
01:26:44,201 --> 01:26:48,622
 I love my life. Yeah, it can be tough at times.
 That's part of it, isn't it?

1341
01:26:48,622 --> 01:26:53,335
 I've got a great job, brilliant kids, lovely flat.
 I've got her to look at.

1342
01:26:53,335 --> 01:26:58,299
 I've got amazing friends. I love my freedom.
 I'm a lucky lady, I know that.

1343
01:26:58,299 --> 01:27:01,051
 - All right, no need to rub it in.
 - What am I rubbing in?

1344
01:27:01,051 --> 01:27:03,095
 - I know what you're saying.
 - What?

1345
01:27:03,095 --> 01:27:05,181
 - You think I've taken the easy option.
 - Hey.

1346
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:06,807
 Hang on, Helen. She didn't say that.

1347
01:27:06,807 --> 01:27:09,477
  - It's what she meant.
 - No, you're insecure about your life. 

1348
01:27:09,477 --> 01:27:11,395
 - All right, Suze.
 - That's not true.

1349
01:27:11,395 --> 01:27:14,231
 - Why are you trying to control everyone?
 - I'm not. I'm not.

1350
01:27:14,231 --> 01:27:16,108
 - Whatever. You're boring me.
 - Leave it out.

1351
01:27:16,108 --> 01:27:18,360
 Why are you all attacking me? It's not fair.

1352
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:22,363
 - No-one's attacking you, Helen.
 - They're not attacking you, Hel.

1353
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:25,659
  - Blimey.
 - It's pathetic. 

1354
01:27:25,659 --> 01:27:28,370
 - Suzy!
 - Sorry.

1355
01:27:28,370 --> 01:27:30,663
  - She'll be all right in a minute.
 - Yeah. 

1356
01:27:32,625 --> 01:27:34,209
 It's hormones.

1357
01:27:38,047 --> 01:27:40,173
 - You all right?
 - Yeah.

1358
01:27:42,176 --> 01:27:46,262
 - Do you want to play a game, Jamie?
 - Yeah, yeah.

1359
01:27:47,223 --> 01:27:49,058
 No, best leave it till the morning.

1360
01:27:49,058 --> 01:27:51,894
 I think we should all go to bed, it's getting late.

1361
01:27:51,894 --> 01:27:53,145
 All right, then.

1362
01:27:53,145 --> 01:27:55,897
 Jamie, go upstairs
 and get the bedding for Suzy.

1363
01:27:56,774 --> 01:27:59,735
  - You're looking tired, Suzy.
 - She always looks like that. 

1364
01:27:59,735 --> 01:28:01,570
 It's just my face.

1365
01:28:01,570 --> 01:28:03,489
 Thanks for the barbecue, Helen. Jamie.

1366
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:05,741
  - Anytime.
 - It was gorgeous. 

1367
01:28:05,741 --> 01:28:06,742
 Thanks.

1368
01:28:06,742 --> 01:28:09,662
  We'll go for a walk by the sea tomorrow.
 It'll be lovely. 

1369
01:28:09,662 --> 01:28:11,079
  Be nice. 

1370
01:28:16,669 --> 01:28:18,670
 Move your arse.

1371
01:28:23,175 --> 01:28:25,176
 Flap, flap, flap!

1372
01:28:28,556 --> 01:28:31,100
 Careful, Poppy.
 I'm worried about you in those shoes.

1373
01:28:31,100 --> 01:28:34,186
 - Don't worry. They're not too high.
 - Poppy, come off the wall.

1374
01:28:34,186 --> 01:28:36,187
 Give us a piggy back?

1375
01:28:44,446 --> 01:28:46,823
 Suzy, don't do that. Don't. Stop it.

1376
01:28:57,543 --> 01:29:00,753
 You should have told me,
 I wouldn't have got on your back.

1377
01:29:12,224 --> 01:29:14,934
 I'm all right. How are you? Good weekend?

1378
01:29:16,645 --> 01:29:18,771
 Oh, heavy night last night, was it?

1379
01:29:20,191 --> 01:29:22,650
 That's what I like to hear. Good boy.

1380
01:29:24,528 --> 01:29:26,989
  So, do you fancy going out sometime, then? 

1381
01:29:26,989 --> 01:29:30,742
  How's Friday looking for you?
 Think you can squeeze me in? 

1382
01:29:34,246 --> 01:29:36,623
 Oh, go on, then. I don't drink.

1383
01:29:37,500 --> 01:29:39,376
 But...

1384
01:29:39,376 --> 01:29:41,377
 Yeah, maybe just the one.

1385
01:29:42,213 --> 01:29:44,422
 Yeah, something like that.

1386
01:29:46,175 --> 01:29:50,470
 All right, then.
 See you then, then, then, then, then.

1387
01:29:52,890 --> 01:29:56,392
 All right. See you, sailor. Bye.

1388
01:30:20,793 --> 01:30:21,626
 Scott!

1389
01:30:41,897 --> 01:30:44,107
 Suzy, wind your sister's window up.

1390
01:31:11,343 --> 01:31:14,305
 What was that all about, then?

1391
01:31:14,305 --> 01:31:16,348
 Search me.

1392
01:31:16,348 --> 01:31:18,225
 Bit weird.

1393
01:31:18,225 --> 01:31:20,226
 Isn't it just?

1394
01:31:22,021 --> 01:31:24,564
 - Gives me the creeps, to be honest.
 - Yeah.

1395
01:31:29,111 --> 01:31:30,863
 So, what are we doing for tea, then?

1396
01:31:30,863 --> 01:31:33,073
 - Takeaway. What do you reckon?
 - Chinese?

1397
01:31:33,073 --> 01:31:35,201
 Oh, hello, look who's here. Little piglet.

1398
01:31:35,201 --> 01:31:36,494
 - Are you paying?
 - No.

1399
01:31:36,494 --> 01:31:39,038
 - Course she's not.
 - Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

1400
01:31:39,038 --> 01:31:40,873
 - Mum and Dad.
 - Which one am I?

1401
01:31:40,873 --> 01:31:43,375
 - Dad, of course.
 - I hate being Dad.

1402
01:31:43,375 --> 01:31:46,127
 - You love it.
 - Oh, get off, Poppy.

1403
01:31:52,343 --> 01:31:54,093
 It's a beautiful sky.

1404
01:32:12,404 --> 01:32:13,906
 There you go.

1405
01:32:13,906 --> 01:32:15,698
 Thanks.

1406
01:32:19,411 --> 01:32:21,704
 So where were we?

1407
01:32:23,249 --> 01:32:24,959
 What brings you here?

1408
01:32:24,959 --> 01:32:27,336
 - I met a girl.
 - Oh, very nice.

1409
01:32:27,336 --> 01:32:29,130
 - Yeah.
 - What's she like, then?

1410
01:32:29,130 --> 01:32:30,756
 - I can't talk about it.
 - Why not?

1411
01:32:30,756 --> 01:32:32,925
 - It's a secret.
 - I'm good with secrets.

1412
01:32:32,925 --> 01:32:36,262
 - It's between me and her, though.
 - Oh, fair enough. I won't pry.

1413
01:32:36,262 --> 01:32:38,471
 - Who is she?
 - I couldn't possibly.

1414
01:32:39,181 --> 01:32:40,974
 Trust me.

1415
01:32:42,393 --> 01:32:43,726
 She's a teacher.

1416
01:32:45,187 --> 01:32:47,356
 - Is she?
 - She's gorgeous.

1417
01:32:47,356 --> 01:32:50,275
 Oh... I hate her already.

1418
01:32:52,069 --> 01:32:53,778
 Haven't you got lovely eyes?

1419
01:32:55,531 --> 01:32:57,658
 - Thanks.
 - Beautiful colour.

1420
01:32:57,658 --> 01:32:59,034
 - Really?
 - Yeah.

1421
01:32:59,034 --> 01:33:00,494
 Picked them myself.

1422
01:33:00,494 --> 01:33:02,204
 - Did you?
 - Yeah.

1423
01:33:02,204 --> 01:33:03,831
 - Where from?
 - Down the market.

1424
01:33:03,831 --> 01:33:05,875
 - You're joking me?
 - No.

1425
01:33:05,875 --> 01:33:08,210
 I'd say you got yourself a bargain there.

1426
01:33:08,210 --> 01:33:11,839
 - You've got one as well.
 - Have I? Just the one? Which one?

1427
01:33:11,839 --> 01:33:13,215
 - That one.
 - This one?

1428
01:33:13,215 --> 01:33:15,217
 - Particularly lovely, is he?
 - He is.

1429
01:33:15,217 --> 01:33:16,844
 But don't upset the other one.

1430
01:33:16,844 --> 01:33:18,304
 - No, she's all right.
 - Is she?

1431
01:33:18,304 --> 01:33:20,347
 - Yeah, we've had a chat about it.
 - Oh, good.

1432
01:33:20,347 --> 01:33:24,059
 Yeah, she's over the worst now.
 Yeah, anyway she's got other talents.

1433
01:33:24,059 --> 01:33:25,227
 - Has she?
 - Yeah.

1434
01:33:25,227 --> 01:33:27,354
 - What are they?
 - So many.

1435
01:33:27,354 --> 01:33:29,231
 - She can juggle.
 - Obviously.

1436
01:33:29,231 --> 01:33:32,485
 Yeah, goes without saying.
 She can wink on demand.

1437
01:33:32,485 --> 01:33:34,110
 - Really?
 - Oh, yeah.

1438
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:37,031
 - Let's see.
 - Are you sure?

1439
01:33:37,031 --> 01:33:39,241
 - Yeah.
 - It's pretty spooky.

1440
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:41,660
 - Go on.
 - OK, are you ready?

1441
01:33:41,660 --> 01:33:43,704
 Yeah.

1442
01:33:43,704 --> 01:33:45,497
 She is good!

1443
01:33:46,499 --> 01:33:49,126
 - This one tries to join in.
 - Don't let him.

1444
01:33:49,126 --> 01:33:50,961
 I won't. Anyway, he's lovely, so...

1445
01:33:50,961 --> 01:33:54,340
 - Well, she's lovely, too.
 - Don't try and claw your way out of it.

1446
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:56,257
 - Sorry.
 - It's all right.

1447
01:33:57,426 --> 01:33:59,094
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers.

1448
01:33:59,094 --> 01:34:00,178
 Again.

1449
01:34:07,436 --> 01:34:09,187
 This is nice.

1450
01:34:11,315 --> 01:34:13,316
 It is nice.

1451
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,101
 Here we are.

1452
01:34:51,981 --> 01:34:53,816
 Wow.

1453
01:34:53,816 --> 01:34:56,026
 Welcome to my humble abode.

1454
01:34:56,026 --> 01:34:57,819
 Thank you.

1455
01:35:24,722 --> 01:35:26,807
 - Aren't you high up?
 - Yeah.

1456
01:35:26,807 --> 01:35:30,478
 Yeah. What's it like up there?

1457
01:35:30,478 --> 01:35:32,479
 Hm. It's OK.

1458
01:35:35,524 --> 01:35:37,525
 That's better.

1459
01:35:49,371 --> 01:35:52,249
 - I think you must be too hot.
 - Yeah, it does feel hot.

1460
01:35:52,249 --> 01:35:54,210
 Yeah, I thought so.

1461
01:35:54,210 --> 01:35:56,211
 Usually right.

1462
01:35:58,214 --> 01:36:01,217
 - Though it's not really my job.
 - No, you're very good at it.

1463
01:36:01,217 --> 01:36:03,552
 I know.

1464
01:36:03,552 --> 01:36:05,762
 Hidden talents.

1465
01:36:08,307 --> 01:36:10,308
 Oh, wow.

1466
01:36:11,852 --> 01:36:14,438
 Now, that's what I call a bargain.

1467
01:36:14,438 --> 01:36:16,648
 - Yeah?
 - Yeah.

1468
01:36:21,403 --> 01:36:23,780
 One, two, three.

1469
01:36:25,241 --> 01:36:26,784
 - I'm a bit hot, too.
 - Yeah?

1470
01:36:26,784 --> 01:36:27,827
 Yeah.

1471
01:36:27,827 --> 01:36:31,080
 - Maybe this'll help.
 - I think you might be right.

1472
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:34,917
 - What about if this...
 - Oh, yeah, and that one. Go on, then.

1473
01:36:34,917 --> 01:36:35,918
 OK.

1474
01:36:35,918 --> 01:36:38,837
 Ooh, I quite like it like that.

1475
01:36:40,923 --> 01:36:42,090
 - Oh!
 - Lovely.

1476
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:46,719
 - What's it like in there?
 - Oh, not bad.

1477
01:37:36,395 --> 01:37:38,355
 I'll go and make that tea.

1478
01:37:38,355 --> 01:37:40,148
 Great.

1479
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:07,176
 Going to be late for my lesson.
 Hey-ho. There you go.

1480
01:38:07,176 --> 01:38:09,345
 - I'll give you a lift.
 - Will you?

1481
01:38:09,345 --> 01:38:10,513
 - Yeah.
 - Oh!

1482
01:38:10,513 --> 01:38:13,390
 - Means I keep you for longer.
 - Thank you very much.

1483
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:15,391
 It's OK.

1484
01:38:16,685 --> 01:38:19,939
 - So when you coming back to school?
 - Oh. Next week.

1485
01:38:19,939 --> 01:38:23,901
 - I'll see how things go with his mum.
 - Yeah, he'll be all right.

1486
01:38:23,901 --> 01:38:25,902
 He'll be fine.

1487
01:38:33,744 --> 01:38:35,579
 Hello.

1488
01:38:35,579 --> 01:38:36,663
 Hi.

1489
01:38:50,136 --> 01:38:53,680
 Are you happy... in your life?

1490
01:38:55,558 --> 01:38:58,184
 That's a big question.

1491
01:39:00,229 --> 01:39:01,813
 Isn't it just?

1492
01:39:27,756 --> 01:39:30,926
 - So, you play football, then?
 - Yeah, five-a-side every week.

1493
01:39:30,926 --> 01:39:33,387
 - Right. Is that indoors or outdoors?
 - No, outdoors.

1494
01:39:33,387 --> 01:39:35,431
 - Oh, here she is.
 - Made it. Just.

1495
01:39:35,431 --> 01:39:39,726
 - Why aren't you wearing any jewellery?
 - Oh, it's that kind of day.

1496
01:39:40,728 --> 01:39:42,605
 So, you doing anything tonight?

1497
01:39:42,605 --> 01:39:44,982
 Yeah, it's a mate's 30th.
 We're all meeting in a bar.

1498
01:39:44,982 --> 01:39:46,859
 - Great.
 - What are you two up to?

1499
01:39:46,859 --> 01:39:48,861
  - Oh, cinema.
 - Yeah, see a film. 

1500
01:39:48,861 --> 01:39:51,071
  - Popcorn...
 - Sit in the dark, hold hands. 

1501
01:39:51,071 --> 01:39:52,448
 Yeah, no necking.

1502
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,492
 She's only saying that cos you're here.

1503
01:39:54,492 --> 01:39:56,285
 Normally I'm all over her like a rash.

1504
01:39:56,285 --> 01:39:58,662
 - I don't blame you.
 - He's a right smoothie.

1505
01:39:58,662 --> 01:40:00,456
 Isn't he just?

1506
01:40:00,456 --> 01:40:02,124
 - Here he is.
 - Nice to meet you.

1507
01:40:02,124 --> 01:40:04,043
 - Nice to meet you.
 - Nice to meet you, Zoe.

1508
01:40:04,043 --> 01:40:06,252
  - Yeah, whatever.
 - Have a good time tonight. 

1509
01:40:07,838 --> 01:40:09,839
  Come on, you. 

1510
01:40:11,926 --> 01:40:15,513
 Hiya, Scott. This is Tim.
 He's coming with us today.

1511
01:40:15,513 --> 01:40:17,472
 - Just joking.
 - Hi.

1512
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:22,019
 - Ooh, can't win them all.
 - Apparently not.

1513
01:40:22,019 --> 01:40:23,646
 - See you later.
 - I'll call you.

1514
01:40:23,646 --> 01:40:24,980
 - Will you?
 - Yeah.

1515
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:26,147
 Good.

1516
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:44,458
 What happened on Sunday, Scott?
 You should've stopped to say hello.

1517
01:40:44,458 --> 01:40:47,586
 I don't know what you're talking about.
 I was in Stevenage on Sunday.

1518
01:40:47,586 --> 01:40:50,005
 Stevenage? Funny, you must have a twin.

1519
01:40:50,005 --> 01:40:52,883
 I was there all day. I was looking after
 my mum. My aunt's dying.

1520
01:40:52,883 --> 01:40:55,511
 - I'm sorry to hear that.
 - It's all right.

1521
01:40:55,511 --> 01:40:59,682
 - Don't believe you, Scott.
 - It's up to you, I was there till midnight.

1522
01:40:59,682 --> 01:41:01,683
 Don't think so, gigolo.

1523
01:41:20,202 --> 01:41:22,997
  Concentrate, Poppy.
 Concentrate. Watch what I'm doing. 

1524
01:41:22,997 --> 01:41:26,917
 Now I'm going to indicate. I keep in lane.
 In a roundabout, you keep
in lane.

1525
01:41:26,917 --> 01:41:29,086
 OK? You keep in lane, all right?

1526
01:41:29,086 --> 01:41:34,258
  You take responsibility for other drivers
 and for yourself and you keep in lane, OK? 

1527
01:41:34,258 --> 01:41:37,219
 This is a roundabout. Concentrate,
 pay attention. Good. Thank you.

1528
01:41:37,219 --> 01:41:39,805
 Are you... Was that a request
 or was that a demand?

1529
01:41:39,805 --> 01:41:42,391
 Did he bully me then? Did he just shove in then?

1530
01:41:42,391 --> 01:41:44,018
  - Or did he ask?
 - Did he? 

1531
01:41:44,018 --> 01:41:46,604
 No, he didn't ask.
 You see what roundabouts do?

1532
01:41:46,604 --> 01:41:50,691
 Roundabouts, if you keep in lane
 and you keep going, you'll be fine.

1533
01:41:50,691 --> 01:41:53,652
 You're following rules and keeping
 everything the way it should be.

1534
01:41:53,652 --> 01:41:54,945
  Everything in check. 

1535
01:41:54,945 --> 01:41:58,324
  But if you get selfish and if you
 step out of it, then it goes wrong. 

1536
01:41:58,324 --> 01:42:00,867
 And it gets dangerous.
 Do you see what I mean?

1537
01:42:05,164 --> 01:42:08,083
 Waa-aaah...

1538
01:42:08,083 --> 01:42:11,253
 I'm not waiting for somebody
 who can't keep in lane on a roundabout.

1539
01:42:11,253 --> 01:42:12,755
 I'm not waiting.

1540
01:42:12,755 --> 01:42:14,840
  Everywhere you see, look at the cameras. 

1541
01:42:14,840 --> 01:42:17,259
 Everywhere you go, they're watching you.

1542
01:42:17,259 --> 01:42:19,929
 They're seeing you. They're watching.
 Everywhere you go.

1543
01:42:19,929 --> 01:42:23,349
 Look at this place, it stinks.
 Come on. What are you waiting for?

1544
01:42:23,349 --> 01:42:27,019
  - All right.
 - Jesus Christ! Look, another camera... 

1545
01:42:27,019 --> 01:42:28,938
 Speed camera. Why do you need them?

1546
01:42:28,938 --> 01:42:31,440
 There's two guys at the back of the road
 selling drugs

1547
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,610
  and you have a speed camera.
 Why do you need a speed camera? 

1548
01:42:34,610 --> 01:42:36,153
 You can wait.

1549
01:42:36,153 --> 01:42:37,570
 - You can wait!
 - Easy.

1550
01:42:42,284 --> 01:42:44,370
  Come on! Drive the car. 

1551
01:42:44,370 --> 01:42:47,915
 You're not driving a camel.
 OK? This is not a bazaar.

1552
01:42:47,915 --> 01:42:51,000
 We have rules in this country.
 We have regulations. Keep to them.

1553
01:42:54,630 --> 01:42:56,631
 Fucking morons!

1554
01:43:17,278 --> 01:43:20,322
 Check your mirrors, your seat,
 make yourself comfortable.

1555
01:43:20,322 --> 01:43:22,116
 - No, I don't think so.
 - Seat belt on.

1556
01:43:22,116 --> 01:43:24,160
 - I'm not going anywhere.
 - What do you mean?

1557
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:26,078
 You are in no fit state to take this lesson.

1558
01:43:26,078 --> 01:43:28,330
 I am the instructor. You are the pupil.

1559
01:43:28,330 --> 01:43:29,999
 - You need to calm down.
 - I am calm.

1560
01:43:29,999 --> 01:43:32,835
 - You can't drive like this.
 - You can't comment on my driving!

1561
01:43:32,835 --> 01:43:36,714
 I think I can when you're putting yourself
 in danger, putting me in danger,

1562
01:43:36,714 --> 01:43:39,425
 - and putting other people in danger.
 - It's them.

1563
01:43:39,425 --> 01:43:42,511
 That's bullshit. It's all bullshit.
 That's it, I don't want it.

1564
01:43:42,511 --> 01:43:44,513
 - You want this lesson to stop?
 - Yes, I do.

1565
01:43:44,513 --> 01:43:47,183
 I don't want you to teach me any more. I'm sorry.

1566
01:43:47,183 --> 01:43:50,436
 OK. Fantastic. Get in the passenger seat
 and I'll drive you home.

1567
01:43:50,436 --> 01:43:52,313
 No, I don't think so. I'm driving.

1568
01:43:52,313 --> 01:43:53,606
 - No, you're not.
 - I am.

1569
01:43:53,606 --> 01:43:55,858
 Poppy, if this isn't a lesson, you can't drive.

1570
01:43:55,858 --> 01:43:57,359
 You're not driving anywhere.

1571
01:43:57,359 --> 01:43:59,987
 You got two choices,
 either I drive you home or you walk.

1572
01:43:59,987 --> 01:44:02,364
 I don't mind walking, but you can't drive this car.

1573
01:44:02,364 --> 01:44:05,492
 - You can't stop me.
 - Yes, I can.

1574
01:44:06,535 --> 01:44:08,662
 - Poppy, give me the keys.
 - No.

1575
01:44:08,662 --> 01:44:11,248
 - Give me the keys to my car.
 - No, I don't think so.

1576
01:44:11,248 --> 01:44:14,543
 I'm going to ask you one more time.
 Please give me the keys to my car.

1577
01:44:14,543 --> 01:44:17,171
 - I'm sorry, I can't.
 - Give me the fucking keys to my car,

1578
01:44:17,171 --> 01:44:18,714
 - you fucking bitch!
 - Get off me!

1579
01:44:18,714 --> 01:44:23,093
 - Give me the... fuck...
 - Get off me. Get off me!

1580
01:44:23,093 --> 01:44:25,888
 - Give me the fucking...
 - Get off me. You get away from me!

1581
01:44:25,888 --> 01:44:29,391
 - Give me the fucking keys!
 - You can't touch me, Scott.

1582
01:44:29,391 --> 01:44:32,520
 - Give me the fucking keys!
 - You can't touch me. You're out of order.

1583
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:35,564
 - Give me those fucking keys!
 - You're out of order.

1584
01:44:35,564 --> 01:44:37,274
 - You're out of order.
 - Give me the...

1585
01:44:37,274 --> 01:44:40,485
 I'm calling the police.
 Do you want me to call the police?

1586
01:44:41,904 --> 01:44:43,238
 Do you?

1587
01:44:46,408 --> 01:44:50,245
 Right. So let's just calm down, shall we?

1588
01:44:52,998 --> 01:44:56,376
 OK, we're disturbing the peace here.

1589
01:45:01,090 --> 01:45:03,926
 I just want to get in my car and drive away.

1590
01:45:03,926 --> 01:45:05,761
  - That's not going to happen.
 - Jesus! 

1591
01:45:05,761 --> 01:45:09,682
 You're doing it again. You never give in
 for fuck's sake, you fucking bitch!

1592
01:45:09,682 --> 01:45:11,433
 - You need help.
 - Don't patronise me.

1593
01:45:11,433 --> 01:45:15,062
  - I'm not patronising you.
 - Yes, you are always patronising me. 

1594
01:45:15,062 --> 01:45:18,232
  This is what you always wanted,
 what you set out to achieve. 

1595
01:45:18,232 --> 01:45:19,691
  This is the game you play. 

1596
01:45:20,401 --> 01:45:24,113
 You prodded me. You poked me.
 You stroked me. You teased me.

1597
01:45:24,113 --> 01:45:26,240
 You flirted with me. You sucked me in.

1598
01:45:26,240 --> 01:45:29,785
  You wore your high-heel boots,
 your short skirt, your low-cut top 

1599
01:45:29,785 --> 01:45:32,079
 and you flashed your tits, you tossed your hair.

1600
01:45:32,079 --> 01:45:35,082
 You played with the gear stick. You lied to me!

1601
01:45:35,082 --> 01:45:39,377
  This is all about you.
 The world has to revolve around you. 

1602
01:45:41,297 --> 01:45:45,009
 I'm a driving instructor.
 I just wanted to do my job.

1603
01:45:45,009 --> 01:45:49,221
 You had no intention of learning how to drive.
 You had one thing in mind.

1604
01:45:49,221 --> 01:45:53,476
 To reel me in. And why?
 Because you have to be adored.

1605
01:45:53,476 --> 01:45:56,479
  You've got to be wanted. And you drink it in. 

1606
01:45:56,479 --> 01:45:59,273
  And you leave me with a spring in your step 

1607
01:45:59,273 --> 01:46:02,818
 and you go off and you fuck your boyfriend
 and you fuck your girlfriend.

1608
01:46:02,818 --> 01:46:06,654
 And you all drive around
 in that stupid, little yellow car.

1609
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:17,874
 Scott...

1610
01:46:25,925 --> 01:46:28,009
 Come on, now.

1611
01:46:37,102 --> 01:46:39,479
 I just want to go home.

1612
01:46:41,607 --> 01:46:42,941
  I'm sure you do. 

1613
01:46:44,193 --> 01:46:46,194
 Don't we all, eh?

1614
01:46:52,827 --> 01:46:54,410
 Tell you what.

1615
01:46:56,539 --> 01:46:58,915
 Why don't we have a talk about it?

1616
01:47:05,214 --> 01:47:07,340
 We'll sit in the car.

1617
01:47:08,175 --> 01:47:10,218
 We'll have a chat, OK?

1618
01:47:12,471 --> 01:47:14,472
 All right?

1619
01:47:17,393 --> 01:47:19,686
 And then I'll give you your keys.

1620
01:47:50,759 --> 01:47:53,052
 I'm sorry if I upset you, Scott.

1621
01:47:59,268 --> 01:48:01,269
 I wish I could make you happy.

1622
01:48:03,522 --> 01:48:05,523
  I was happy. 

1623
01:48:07,943 --> 01:48:09,527
 OK.

1624
01:48:12,490 --> 01:48:14,616
 And I was in Stevenage last Sunday.

1625
01:48:17,161 --> 01:48:19,537
  - Sure.
 - You can ask my mum. 

1626
01:48:27,213 --> 01:48:29,422
 So, same time next week?

1627
01:48:45,981 --> 01:48:47,941
 I'm sorry, Scott.

1628
01:48:54,865 --> 01:48:56,491
 There you go.

1629
01:48:59,787 --> 01:49:01,621
 I'll just get my bag, all right?

1630
01:49:09,255 --> 01:49:11,089
 I'm a good driving instructor.

1631
01:49:14,343 --> 01:49:16,719
 Yeah, I know you are.

1632
01:49:26,856 --> 01:49:28,231
 Take care, Scott.

1633
01:49:30,192 --> 01:49:32,152
 Was that your boyfriend?

1634
01:49:36,323 --> 01:49:38,283
 Before?

1635
01:49:42,580 --> 01:49:44,372
 Was it?

1636
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,746
 I think I should give up smoking.

1637
01:52:28,746 --> 01:52:31,373
 That's a good idea.

1638
01:52:31,373 --> 01:52:33,374
 What can I give up?

1639
01:52:34,084 --> 01:52:36,544
 You could give up being too nice.

1640
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:40,382
 Seriously, you can't make everyone happy.

1641
01:52:40,382 --> 01:52:44,385
 There's no harm in trying, though, is there?
 Bring a smile to the world.

1642
01:52:45,387 --> 01:52:47,931
 - Come on, Poppy.
 - I know. I know.

1643
01:52:49,391 --> 01:52:51,769
 I still think we should call the police.

1644
01:52:51,769 --> 01:52:53,895
 No, that's not going to help him, is it?

1645
01:52:54,772 --> 01:52:56,397
 I don't know.

1646
01:52:56,982 --> 01:52:59,235
 - You know what?
 - What?

1647
01:52:59,235 --> 01:53:01,611
 - We're lucky, aren't we?
 - Yeah, we are.

1648
01:53:02,988 --> 01:53:05,866
 Well... well, you make your own luck in life,
 don't you?

1649
01:53:05,866 --> 01:53:09,036
 Well, some of us do.
 Some of us miss the boat completely.

1650
01:53:09,036 --> 01:53:11,330
 It's hard work being a grown-up, isn't it?

1651
01:53:11,330 --> 01:53:14,291
 Yeah, it is. It's a long trip.

1652
01:53:14,291 --> 01:53:16,292
 Yeah, tell me when we get there.

1653
01:53:17,253 --> 01:53:19,629
 Don't worry, I'll let you know.

1654
01:53:21,841 --> 01:53:25,719
 You keep on rowing and I'll keep on smiling.

1655
01:53:25,719 --> 01:53:27,720
 Hm. Are we there yet?

1656
01:53:30,558 --> 01:53:32,559
 We've got a hell of a way to go.

1657
01:53:40,734 --> 01:53:43,820
 We're getting good at this, aren't we?
 Nothing to it.

1658
01:53:56,167 --> 01:54:00,045
 Hello, you. Missing me already?

1659
01:54:00,045 --> 01:54:02,214
 Oh...

1660
01:54:02,214 --> 01:54:04,257
 That's nice to hear.

1661
01:54:06,135 --> 01:54:08,136
 A nightmare. Yeah.

1662
01:54:08,971 --> 01:54:11,264
 I'm still alive... just.

1663
01:54:12,725 --> 01:54:15,352
 Well... it's a long story.

1664
01:54:15,352 --> 01:54:17,855
 I'm on the lake, with Zoe.

1665
01:54:17,855 --> 01:54:20,316
 Yeah.

1666
01:54:20,316 --> 01:54:22,651
 The bathroom flooded, yeah.

1667
01:54:22,651 --> 01:54:24,987
 It's all right now. We've found a boat.

1668
01:54:24,987 --> 01:54:28,531
 You're
 funny.

1669
01:54:33,829 --> 01:54:36,039
 No.
