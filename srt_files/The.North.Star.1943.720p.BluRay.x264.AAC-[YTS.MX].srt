1
00:01:38,102 --> 00:01:40,604
Good morning, my
little honey bees.

2
00:01:40,605 --> 00:01:42,606
Good morning!

3
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:44,608
Good morning. Good morning.

4
00:01:44,609 --> 00:01:46,111
Good morning, one and all.

5
00:01:46,112 --> 00:01:48,111
Good... Morning!

6
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,614
Good morning!

7
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:10,634
Anna!

8
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:11,636
Anna!

9
00:02:12,136 --> 00:02:13,136
Anna!

10
00:02:13,137 --> 00:02:14,638
Where's Pavel Grigorich?

11
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,640
I've come to be your
guest for breakfast.

12
00:02:16,641 --> 00:02:17,641
Stop shouting.

13
00:02:17,642 --> 00:02:18,807
Don't be so young
with the voice.

14
00:02:18,844 --> 00:02:20,346
You'll have to come
back, Comrade Karp.

15
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,846
Grandpa is still asleep.

16
00:02:21,847 --> 00:02:24,350
A new baby came to the
hospital last night,

17
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:26,350
and then Grandpa came
home and did his writing.

18
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:27,351
Good morning.

19
00:02:27,352 --> 00:02:29,854
That's not the way you say it.

20
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:32,857
You say, "a baby came
into the bright world

21
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:36,362
in the darkest part
of the night."

22
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:40,664
Don't talk so pretty.

23
00:02:40,665 --> 00:02:42,666
A new baby. Isn't that nice?

24
00:02:42,667 --> 00:02:44,168
What's nice about it?

25
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:45,170
I -- I'll be back.

26
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:47,671
You argue too much.

27
00:02:47,672 --> 00:02:49,673
Heep!

28
00:02:49,674 --> 00:02:51,175
Good morning, Grandpa.

29
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:53,679
Ah. Good morning, my lad.

30
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:06,691
You should not have
worked all night.

31
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:09,193
Mm. I had a good night's work.

32
00:03:09,194 --> 00:03:11,195
Did a little writing.

33
00:03:11,196 --> 00:03:12,696
Feel better? Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:12,697 --> 00:03:14,699
Come and have breakfast now.

35
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,161
Oh, dear.

36
00:03:21,706 --> 00:03:24,708
What seems to be the
trouble, Boris Stepanich?

37
00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:27,711
It'll take a better mechanic
than I am to answer that.

38
00:03:27,712 --> 00:03:30,214
The patient is cured, Father.

39
00:03:30,215 --> 00:03:31,215
It's all right now.

40
00:03:31,216 --> 00:03:32,716
Hello, Comrade Karp.

41
00:03:32,717 --> 00:03:34,718
You ever been to Kiev?
Of course.

42
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,722
There was a pretty girl there
who lost her head over me.

43
00:03:37,923 --> 00:03:39,924
Years ago. Oh, of course.

44
00:03:39,925 --> 00:03:42,927
Well, it is the
last day of school.

45
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:44,929
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be on our way.

46
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,932
It's our vacation, and we're
going to Kiev on a holiday.

47
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,435
That's a nice bus ride.

48
00:03:49,436 --> 00:03:50,935
Not for us. We're hiking.

49
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:52,938
All the way? Well, of course.

50
00:03:53,438 --> 00:03:54,939
It'll only take us
four or five days.

51
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,440
Only?

52
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,942
Marina is going?

53
00:03:57,943 --> 00:04:00,945
Yes. Marina and
Clavdia and grisha.

54
00:04:00,946 --> 00:04:03,447
My brother -- unfortunately.

55
00:04:03,448 --> 00:04:06,952
Ah, but Marina is
the one who counts.

56
00:04:08,453 --> 00:04:09,453
Have you proposed?

57
00:04:09,454 --> 00:04:12,456
Or does one propose in
these modern times?

58
00:04:12,457 --> 00:04:13,958
Good morning, Papa.

59
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,461
Good morning.

60
00:04:22,467 --> 00:04:24,468
What are you doing, Marina?

61
00:04:24,469 --> 00:04:26,470
I'm baking honey
cakes for the trip.

62
00:04:26,471 --> 00:04:28,472
The cakes have
to be baked now?

63
00:04:28,473 --> 00:04:30,975
You're not leaving
until tomorrow.

64
00:04:30,976 --> 00:04:32,478
Well, it's hard at our age

65
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,479
to remember how
exciting a trip can be.

66
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,982
The planning is half the fun.

67
00:04:39,985 --> 00:04:42,488
A long time ago, this is
the way I wore my hair.

68
00:04:42,988 --> 00:04:45,491
Were you pretty, Mama,
when you were young?

69
00:04:45,492 --> 00:04:47,491
I'm not so old, little one.

70
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:49,995
Mama's pretty now.
And she's not old.

71
00:04:50,495 --> 00:04:51,996
It's only that
you're so young.

72
00:04:51,997 --> 00:04:53,998
I'm not so young.

73
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:55,501
There are plenty
who are younger.

74
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,002
Yes. And there always will be.

75
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:03,007
Sophia, when you go marketing,
remind everybody to come

76
00:05:03,008 --> 00:05:05,511
and help with the
loading of the trains.

77
00:05:05,512 --> 00:05:07,511
Tell them there will
be supper for all

78
00:05:07,512 --> 00:05:08,552
when the work is finished.

79
00:05:09,014 --> 00:05:11,015
I'll tell everybody!
I'll tell everybody!

80
00:05:11,016 --> 00:05:12,516
May I, Papa? May I?

81
00:05:12,517 --> 00:05:14,518
I'll do it on my
way to school.

82
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,020
Please, may I? May I, please?

83
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,022
All right. You tell them.

84
00:05:18,023 --> 00:05:20,024
I'll say there will be
supper for everybody.

85
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,025
Yes.

86
00:05:21,026 --> 00:05:23,529
I'll say there will
be music and singing.

87
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:25,029
I'll say there
will be dancing,

88
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,031
and I'll say there will
be cider for old people

89
00:05:27,032 --> 00:05:28,532
and fruit drinks for children.

90
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,535
You might also remember to
say there will be work.

91
00:05:32,037 --> 00:05:33,537
Oh.

92
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:35,539
Yes. I'll say that, too.

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:39,544
"Everybody must
work," I'll say.

94
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:42,546
No pancakes?

95
00:05:42,547 --> 00:05:45,549
You know what else the comrade
commander said to me?

96
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,052
You have my permission
not to tell me.

97
00:05:48,053 --> 00:05:50,054
"Eat pancakes."
That's what he said.

98
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,056
It has been
recently discovered

99
00:05:52,057 --> 00:05:54,560
that pancakes are fine for
a bombardier's nerves.

100
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,060
That ought to
interest you, Damian.

101
00:05:56,061 --> 00:05:57,563
You're going to be a doctor.

102
00:05:57,564 --> 00:06:00,564
It doesn't interest me.

103
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:02,566
Don't worry with
those maps, Damian.

104
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,068
I know all the roads.

105
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,571
And when we get to Kiev,

106
00:06:05,572 --> 00:06:09,074
I will show you and your little
friends all there is to see.

107
00:06:09,574 --> 00:06:12,576
Me and my little friends
are still young.

108
00:06:12,577 --> 00:06:13,577
A visit to Kiev

109
00:06:13,578 --> 00:06:16,080
is something that doesn't
happen to us every day.

110
00:06:16,081 --> 00:06:18,582
And don't patronize
us about it.

111
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,584
Be a man of the world in
front of your mirror.

112
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,586
It's better that way.
Mirrors don't talk back.

113
00:06:22,587 --> 00:06:24,088
Hmm!

114
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,593
Most men in the world feel
pleased when they have sons.

115
00:06:27,594 --> 00:06:28,593
I wonder why.

116
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:30,594
I told you years ago.

117
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:33,597
Two quiet little girls
would have been very nice.

118
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:36,600
Well, you can't change us now,
and you wouldn't if you could.

119
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:39,603
Two healthy, brilliant,
handsome sons.

120
00:06:39,604 --> 00:06:42,606
June 20, 1941, 8:00 A.M.,

121
00:06:42,607 --> 00:06:44,608
broadcasting from moscow.
Be still, both of you.

122
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:49,613
German troop movements are
reported on the Polish border.

123
00:06:49,614 --> 00:06:51,615
Their nature is unknown.

124
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:53,617
Reports reach us of
a typhus epidemic

125
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,619
in the German-occupied
city of Warsaw.

126
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,623
London was bombed twice last
night by the Luftwaffe.

127
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:00,626
In the Polish city of Lodz,

128
00:07:00,627 --> 00:07:04,128
112 Polish children died
this morning as a result

129
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:07,633
of being made to give blood
transfusions to German wounded.

130
00:07:07,634 --> 00:07:10,634
Children. Taking blood from...

131
00:07:10,635 --> 00:07:13,138
Here's a report from a
reliable source in --

132
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:33,657
goodbye, now.

133
00:07:33,658 --> 00:07:34,658
Goodbye, sweetheart.

134
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,660
Goodbye, Papa. Bye, baby.

135
00:07:36,161 --> 00:07:38,162
Goodbye, Papa.

136
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,665
Bye, Mama. Bye, dear.

137
00:07:44,169 --> 00:07:46,670
Come on, Clavdia!
You'll be late!

138
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:48,173
You're my brother,
not my guardian.

139
00:07:48,673 --> 00:07:50,175
Mind your business.

140
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:54,678
Good morning, Clavdia.

141
00:07:54,679 --> 00:07:56,680
Good morning, Marina.

142
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,681
You're early.

143
00:07:57,682 --> 00:07:59,684
Oh! You know I never
eat breakfast.

144
00:08:01,186 --> 00:08:03,187
You always look so clean.

145
00:08:03,188 --> 00:08:05,189
You're no cleaner than I am.

146
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,192
Maybe not as clean.
And hair is curly.

147
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:09,693
Your hair looks nice.

148
00:08:09,694 --> 00:08:11,696
Oh, it's as straight as wheat.

149
00:08:12,197 --> 00:08:14,199
And don't try to console me.

150
00:08:17,702 --> 00:08:18,702
Well, well.

151
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:21,205
The last day of school
is a happy day.

152
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:22,206
Even I remember.

153
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,707
Oh, no. No?

154
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,710
We're very sorry
it's the last day.

155
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,753
My first words will
be to congratulate

156
00:09:09,754 --> 00:09:12,256
our three pupils
in the last class

157
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:14,258
who have all been
awarded scholarships

158
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:16,762
to the state
University of Kiev.

159
00:09:18,263 --> 00:09:21,265
One of those three has
taken the highest marks

160
00:09:21,266 --> 00:09:25,270
of any pupil in this
year's senior graduating class.

161
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,772
He is Damian Taratsa.

162
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:41,285
It is not my custom to start
your vacation with a lecture.

163
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:46,290
But this is the summer
of 1941, a solemn time.

164
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,794
No one of us knows
what will happen.

165
00:09:50,295 --> 00:09:51,797
I don't have to remind you

166
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:55,799
that we are people
with a noble history.

167
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,302
You are expected to
carry on that history

168
00:09:58,303 --> 00:10:02,307
with complete devotion
and self-sacrifice.

169
00:10:02,807 --> 00:10:04,809
I think you'll do that.

170
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,314
And now... Have a happy summer.

I-I can't explain it, but,
well, I-I almost wish

185
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,418
we weren't having
this supper tonight.

186
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,420
Oh, goodness knows
I usually love it.

188

with the trip, if you

00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,927
Too many good things at once.

190
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:03,927
Mm. I felt it, too.

191
00:12:03,928 --> 00:12:05,429
I didn't want
anything to happen.

192
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:06,932
Just the trip. Nothing else.

193
00:12:06,933 --> 00:12:08,932
Oh, well. We really won't
celebrate tonight.

194
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:11,435
We'll just eat supper and act
like it was any other evening

195
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:12,938
and we were home
with the family.

196
00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:15,940

Kolya says we'll go to the
theater when we get to Kiev.

222
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:11,116
All we have to do is
apply for the tickets.

223
00:15:11,117 --> 00:15:12,616
We'll have three
whole days in Kiev.

224
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:14,618
We shall see everything.

225
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,620
It's been a good year.

226
00:15:16,621 --> 00:15:20,125
Scholarship to the university,
of course, means the most.

227
00:15:20,126 --> 00:15:22,626
There was a medal
for marksmanship.

228
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:24,629
And now this vacation.

229
00:15:26,631 --> 00:15:28,632
We'll be separated for a year.

230
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:31,635
You'll be getting a scholarship
the following year.

231
00:15:31,636 --> 00:15:34,139
But it's this year
I'm thinking about.

232
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,640
That's a long time.

233
00:15:37,141 --> 00:15:39,643
I don't think it
is at our age.

234
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,144
You don't think so?

235
00:15:41,145 --> 00:15:43,147
How strange.

236
00:15:43,648 --> 00:15:45,649
What are you saying, Marina?

237
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,154
Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

238
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:56,159
It's odd you don't think a year
away from me is a long time.

239
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,161
It doesn't worry you?

240
00:15:58,162 --> 00:16:00,163
No.

241
00:16:00,164 --> 00:16:01,665
All right.

242
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,669
You don't have to keep
saying it over and over.

243
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:08,673
Are you sure you feel
about me as you used to?

244
00:16:09,674 --> 00:16:12,177
I don't like this talk.
It -- it's bad.

245
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:14,679
It's only natural that I --
it's not natural at all.

246
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,681
It's not like you.

247
00:16:17,181 --> 00:16:20,183
I've loved you since I was
old enough to see you.

248
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,686
I will love you until I die.

249
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:24,187
That's the way it is,

250
00:16:24,188 --> 00:16:25,690
and there's no need
to talk about it.

251
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,691
You mean you'll never
talk about it?

252
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:29,192
You'll never tell me?

253
00:16:29,193 --> 00:16:31,695
I'll tell you in my own time.

254
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:34,199
But I'll not tell
you to waste time.

255
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:35,700
Look here, Marina.

256
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,702
You and I are -- are
like one person.

257
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:41,706
And I always thought you wanted
both of us to be educated and --

258
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,206
I didn't mean that.

259
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,208
Of course I want you to
go to the university.

260
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:46,710
Of course.

261
00:16:46,711 --> 00:16:48,712
It'd make me sad
if you didn't --

262
00:16:48,713 --> 00:16:49,713
and ashamed.

263
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,216
But it wouldn't matter.

264
00:16:51,217 --> 00:16:52,716
I'd go anyway.

265
00:16:52,717 --> 00:16:55,719
I'm a citizen of this country.

266
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,721
I intend to go forward
with it and --

267
00:16:57,722 --> 00:16:59,723
and to give it all I have.

268
00:16:59,724 --> 00:17:02,225
I have strong
feelings about it.

269
00:17:02,226 --> 00:17:04,728
You'll come along
with those feelings.

270
00:17:04,729 --> 00:17:08,233
But... You don't
come before them.

271
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:10,734
I understand.

272
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:15,240
I feel the same way for
myself, for both of us.

273
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,741
I was being foolish.

274
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:19,743
I only wanted to be with you.

275
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:22,746
I'm proud you got the
scholarship, of course.

276
00:17:22,747 --> 00:17:23,747
You'll be a great man,

277
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:26,251
and the whole district
will be proud of you.

278
00:17:26,252 --> 00:17:27,751
You'll have medals.

279
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:29,753
I think we'll go to the
theater every night.

280
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:30,755
That's too often.

281
00:17:31,255 --> 00:17:32,756
And we'll grow old together,

282
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:35,260
and I'll be a beautiful
old woman and very kind.

283
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:36,760
Oh, I'm sure of it.

284
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:39,262
My grandchildren will love me,

285
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:41,765
and you will, too,
more than ever.

286
00:17:41,766 --> 00:17:43,268
What's wrong with that?

287
00:17:43,269 --> 00:17:44,768
Plenty of people
grow old together

288
00:17:44,769 --> 00:17:46,271
and have a fine
life behind them.

289
00:17:46,771 --> 00:17:49,274
I didn't say there was
anything wrong with it.

290
00:17:52,777 --> 00:17:55,278
I shall buy baby
dresses in Kiev.

291
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,780
For whom?

292
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:58,783
For our first...

293
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:01,785
Our grandchildren.

294
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:03,286
Oh.

295
00:18:03,287 --> 00:18:07,791
You'll, um, you'll put the
dresses away for a while?

296
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,295
Yes. Of course
that's what I mean.

297
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,872
When we get home, you and
I should call a meeting,

298
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:31,376
and the five of us should
go over all the plans

299
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:32,876
for our journey tomorrow.

300
00:19:32,877 --> 00:19:35,378
Don't you think, Kolya?

301
00:19:36,097 --> 00:19:37,089
I don't need to plan

302
00:19:37,144 --> 00:19:39,384
to get up and get dressed
and eat my breakfast.

303
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:40,884
I know how to do that.

304
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:44,888
I'm getting tired of hearing you
children talk about this trip.

305
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:46,890
I'm only going because
Father made me.

306
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:48,366
Oh.

307
00:19:48,794 --> 00:19:52,216
Oh, I thought it was because
-- well, because me.

308
00:19:52,396 --> 00:19:54,397
I-I mean us.

309
00:19:54,398 --> 00:19:57,400
Don't you like us?

310
00:19:57,401 --> 00:19:58,903
No.

311
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:00,904
Oh.

312
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:03,381
What's the matter
with you, Clavdia?

313
00:20:04,313 --> 00:20:07,223
I-I have a choking
sensation in my chest.

314
00:20:07,504 --> 00:20:08,411
You eat too much.

315
00:20:08,412 --> 00:20:09,913
You usually do.

316
00:20:09,914 --> 00:20:11,414
It's not at all that.

317
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:13,918
It's my emotions in the chest.

318
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:17,921
Clavdia, you're a throwback.

319
00:20:17,922 --> 00:20:19,424
What's that? What do you mean?

320
00:20:19,924 --> 00:20:22,427
Somebody who doesn't
belong to their own time.

321
00:20:22,428 --> 00:20:26,429
Ours is a new world, Clavdia.
You don't belong in it.

322
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:27,931
Oh, I see.

323
00:20:27,932 --> 00:20:29,933
You mean I'm rather
old-fashioned

324
00:20:29,934 --> 00:20:31,936
and romantic, rather.

325
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:34,439
Yeah.

326
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:43,464
No.

327
00:21:44,121 --> 00:21:46,060
I've told you -- you
cannot come along.

328
00:21:48,714 --> 00:21:49,915
I'm always too young.

329
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:52,046
I'm too young for everything.

330
00:21:53,468 --> 00:21:56,718
Well, someday, when everybody
else is too old for everything,

331
00:21:56,918 --> 00:21:59,168
you'll be just old enough.

332
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,554
Take care of the puppy.

333
00:22:29,555 --> 00:22:31,170
I'll bring everybody
a present.

334
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:32,727
Don't get your feet wet.

335
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,787
And take care of yourselves.

336
00:22:34,972 --> 00:22:38,474
Goodbye.

337
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:39,562
Goodbye!

338
00:22:39,563 --> 00:22:41,064
Papa.

339
00:22:41,065 --> 00:22:43,067
Goodbye.

340
00:22:59,463 --> 00:23:02,467
The first time we have ever
been separated, Grandpa.

341
00:23:04,115 --> 00:23:07,118
It's only for a short time.

342
00:23:13,156 --> 00:23:14,097
Good morning.

343
00:23:16,198 --> 00:23:18,200
Clumsy in the body are
those clumsy in the head.

344
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,901
You wake Grandpa and I'll --

345
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:21,702
oh, I'm gonna kill you,
you nasty little thing.

346
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:22,370
I'm gonna kill you.

347
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,706
Drink your milk, Clavdia.

348
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:35,217
You will now find it more
comfortable to get up.

349
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,220
Goodbye, Father.

350
00:23:39,221 --> 00:23:41,722
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

351
00:23:41,723 --> 00:23:43,862
Seven times last night
you said goodbye.

352
00:23:43,893 --> 00:23:45,447
We'll be back soon.

353
00:23:45,734 --> 00:23:48,323
We'll try to get
along without you.

354
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,732
Well, goodbye!

355
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:54,236
Oh, Mother.

356
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,737
We'll be back soon.

357
00:23:56,738 --> 00:23:57,541
Oh, have a good time, son.

358
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,241
We'll miss you.

359
00:23:59,242 --> 00:24:01,744
Damian?

360
00:24:03,145 --> 00:24:05,481
Damian!

361
00:24:06,148 --> 00:24:07,333
Coming!

362
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:14,155
Good journey, Marina.

363
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:15,658
Good journey.

364
00:24:16,158 --> 00:24:21,162
Good journey! Good journey!

365
00:24:21,163 --> 00:24:22,663
Good journey!

366
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:24,665
Good journey to us all!

367
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,666
Kolya!

368
00:24:26,164 --> 00:24:27,168
Good morning, Kolya.

369
00:24:27,169 --> 00:24:28,671
- Good morning!
- Hello.

370
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,672
Good morning, good
morning, good morning.

371
00:24:31,673 --> 00:24:32,673
Hey!

372
00:24:32,674 --> 00:24:34,176
Good morning, Clavdia.

373
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:47,188
What's the matter with you?
With your face?

374
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:48,691
You look so foolish.

375
00:24:49,191 --> 00:24:51,193
Well, you never said "good
morning" to me before.

376
00:24:51,693 --> 00:24:53,194
Good morning!

377
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,695
Good morning, Kolya.

378
00:24:54,696 --> 00:24:56,198
Good morning!

379
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,702
I don't like guns, Kolya.

380
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:00,703
Then don't have one.

381
00:25:01,203 --> 00:25:02,203
I don't like the
noise they make.

382
00:25:02,204 --> 00:25:04,705
Who does? Why are
you carrying it?

383
00:25:04,706 --> 00:25:07,708
If you look at me, Clavdia, you
will see that I'm in uniform.

384
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:09,210
Men in uniform carry guns.

385
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,212
Uniforms, air force,

386
00:25:11,213 --> 00:25:13,214
Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

387
00:25:13,215 --> 00:25:14,715
Remember now?

388
00:25:14,716 --> 00:25:17,718
Oh, you're teasing me.

389
00:25:17,719 --> 00:25:19,720
Well, don't play with
that gun, please.

390
00:25:19,721 --> 00:25:21,197
I intend to use it.

391
00:25:22,363 --> 00:25:23,673
When we near the
end of the trip,

392
00:25:23,699 --> 00:25:24,700
I intend to kill someone

393
00:25:24,726 --> 00:25:26,227
and leave their carcass
for the hawks.

394
00:25:26,228 --> 00:25:27,229
You want to help?

395
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,183
Oh, no. No. I will stop you.

396
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:31,732
I-I will sacrifice myself.

397
00:25:31,733 --> 00:25:35,236
Oh, I couldn't stand to
think of you lying in jail,

398
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:37,740
a murderer, tortured
with conscience.

399
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:39,240
Oh, Kolya.

400
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:41,242
I've got to kill him. But who?

401
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:42,244
Damian.

402
00:25:44,246 --> 00:25:49,251

00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:08,889
I told you young athletes not
to walk so far and so fast

443
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:09,890
the first day.

444
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:12,894
Make a fire.

445
00:28:13,895 --> 00:28:16,397
We must have a fire.

446
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,401
A fire is so romantic.

447
00:28:21,903 --> 00:28:25,406
Oh, we must have a fire.

448
00:28:25,407 --> 00:28:28,909
Otherwise, we can't
sit around and dream.

449
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,413
Maybe it would be
better to kill you.

450
00:29:59,501 --> 00:30:03,504
Do, um, do all men make
noises when they sleep?

451
00:30:03,505 --> 00:30:05,507
I don't know. I never
listen to all men.

452
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:14,014
Hey, it's Karp.

453
00:30:14,015 --> 00:30:16,016
Oh! Karp!

454
00:30:16,017 --> 00:30:18,519
Good morning, Karp!
Good morning!

455
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,023
Good morning. Good morning.
I thought we'd pass you.

456
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:22,523
We're on our way home.

457
00:30:22,524 --> 00:30:24,026
I'll give you a ride
to the crossroads.

458
00:30:24,027 --> 00:30:26,026
Good! It's time for a ride.

459
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:28,529
You can't go on a walking trip
and take a ride. You can't.

460
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,531
Well, you see
more if you walk,

461
00:30:30,532 --> 00:30:32,533
but we'd only be
riding a few miles.

462
00:30:32,534 --> 00:30:34,034
Oh, come on.

463
00:30:34,035 --> 00:30:36,538
And riding's good
for the feet.

464
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:56,557
Well, well. Nothing
like having good feet.

465
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:58,058
My feet are not good.

466
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:00,060
They're much too small.
Everybody knows that.

467
00:31:00,061 --> 00:31:01,563
I think we should walk.

468
00:31:02,063 --> 00:31:04,064
You can't go on a walking
trip and take a ride.

469
00:31:04,065 --> 00:31:05,566
Who made up that law?

470
00:31:05,567 --> 00:31:07,069
It's not a law. It's just --

471
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,570
well, it's --
it's not romantic.

472
00:31:09,571 --> 00:31:10,571
I see.

473
00:31:10,572 --> 00:31:13,574
You and Marina walk.
We men will ride.

474
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,077
Would you ride while I walked?

475
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:18,078
Darling Marina, I'm
not making you walk.

476
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:20,080
But would you let me
walk while you rode?

477
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:22,082
The brightest of women
are not bright.

478
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:23,584
I'm learning that.

479
00:31:23,585 --> 00:31:24,585
We are women.

480
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:26,587
Different things go
on in our heads.

481
00:31:26,588 --> 00:31:28,090
That's what makes
us attractive.

482
00:31:28,091 --> 00:31:30,090
You coming?

483
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:32,093
If you're quite
certain you want me.

484
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,599
A fine marriage yours will be.

485
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,601
Boss you and then
laugh at you.

486
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,102
Oh, come on, Clavdia.

487
00:31:42,103 --> 00:31:44,104
When you don't stand
by your convictions,

488
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:46,607
you set back the cause of all
women everywhere in the world.

489
00:31:46,608 --> 00:31:48,286
She's an interesting
type, Clavdia.

490
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:50,346

Something the matter
with the sun.

00:33:10,141 --> 00:33:12,644
Is that an old saying, Karp?

509
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:16,647

Tell me what you mean.

510
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:18,148

You've been hearing
your own head.

518
00:33:33,164 --> 00:33:34,665
A wit.

519
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:35,667
I hear it.

520
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,168
I've been hearing
it for an hour.

521
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:40,170
But I don't know.

522

What are you

00:33:57,588 --> 00:33:59,406
We can all hear it.
They're planes.

528
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:01,617
And you ought to know
what planes sound like.

529
00:34:01,743 --> 00:34:04,246
They're many planes, and
they're not far from here.

530
00:34:04,247 --> 00:34:06,246
Can't we have an air force
while you're on leave?

531
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:08,749
You should have let Grandpa
examine your head.

532
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,253
Maybe there's something
wrong inside.

533
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:16,258
Whoa!

534
00:34:16,758 --> 00:34:18,760
Whoa.

535
00:35:00,802 --> 00:35:03,805
Get down! All of you!
Get down immediately!

536
00:35:05,306 --> 00:35:07,809
We're being bombed!
Understand that! Quickly!

537
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:14,816
Get out of your wagons and get
into the ditch immediately!

538
00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:20,320
Leave the horses.
Get in the ditch!

539
00:35:20,321 --> 00:35:21,822
I don't believe you. We
can't leave the horses.

540
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:24,326
I intend to use this gun on
anybody who isn't in that ditch.

541
00:36:37,398 --> 00:36:38,900
Marina.

542
00:37:25,947 --> 00:37:27,447
Will he --

543
00:37:27,448 --> 00:37:28,949
I don't know yet. I
don't think he --

544
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,951
let me. No.

545
00:37:30,952 --> 00:37:33,955
You take a drink
of water, child.

546
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:50,470
Both of you... Close your
eyes and take my arm.

547
00:37:50,471 --> 00:37:54,474
The face of war is ugly
and not for the young.

548
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,478
We are not young anymore.

549
00:38:35,016 --> 00:38:37,017
Any better?

550
00:38:37,018 --> 00:38:38,520
No.

551
00:38:41,022 --> 00:38:43,023
Clavdia?

552
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:45,025
No.

553
00:38:45,026 --> 00:38:49,029
I guess it's the first time in
my life I haven't been hungry.

554
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:52,534
Oh, yesterday we were home,
and everybody in the --

555
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:58,038
one day you're home,
and the next day...

556
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:01,041
The next day, here you are.

557
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:05,045
Last week, the little boy was
in the store with his mother.

558
00:39:05,046 --> 00:39:07,047
I met them there.

559
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,548
He had a ball,

560
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:11,552
and he was bouncing it
with his left hand.

561
00:39:12,053 --> 00:39:15,555
I remember because I
noticed he was left-handed

562
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:18,058
and wondered what it felt
like to be left-handed.

563
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:21,061
And now there he is
without his left hand.

564
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:23,064
Without the hand that
bounced the ball!

565
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,041
Oh! I shouldn't be
talking this way!

566
00:39:26,067 --> 00:39:27,567
I know it!

567
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:29,569
You're all ashamed of me.

568
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,704
You are what you are, Clavdia.

569
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,576
It is my opinion that the
trouble in the world

570
00:39:34,577 --> 00:39:36,576
comes from people who
don't know what they are,

571
00:39:36,577 --> 00:39:39,080
who pretend to be
something they're not.

572
00:39:41,082 --> 00:39:42,582
Come on, Clavdia.

573
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,583
I'll wash your face.

574
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:45,586
Dirty cheeks.

575
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:49,589
Go back.

576
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,094
It's over. There
is nothing to do.

577
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,120
Good morning, Nadya.

578
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:22,122
Well, how do you feel?

579
00:40:22,123 --> 00:40:25,125
I always wanted to know
how the doctor felt.

580
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:27,627
I'm very glad to have a patient.

581
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:29,629
People around here
are too healthy.

582
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:30,630
You like your baby?

583
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:33,634
Oh, she's very ugly,
like her father.

584
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,638
And beautiful.

585
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:13,174
Olga!

586
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:52,713
Commander Petrov of the
12th Border Cavalry

587
00:41:53,214 --> 00:41:55,215
speaking to the
border villages.

588
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:56,718
The fascist armies
of the German Reich

589
00:41:56,719 --> 00:41:58,718
invaded the Soviet
Union this morning.

590
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:00,220
I will repeat.

591
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:01,723
German armies crossed the border

592
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:03,723
of the Soviet Union
this morning.

593
00:42:03,724 --> 00:42:06,726
The attack was made with
unprecedented fury.

594
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:08,228
But our land will be defended

595
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:11,231
with a fury the fascist
armies have never known.

596
00:42:11,232 --> 00:42:14,736
To the border villages,
salute, comrades.

597
00:42:15,236 --> 00:42:16,738
The war has come.

598
00:43:51,832 --> 00:43:57,337
Comrades, we have good reason to
know that our country is at war.

599
00:43:57,338 --> 00:44:01,341
In our small village alone,
30 people have been injured.

600
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:04,344
Eleven people have been killed.

601
00:44:04,345 --> 00:44:07,347
But this is not a
time for mourning.

602
00:44:07,348 --> 00:44:10,850
It is time for revenge.

603
00:44:10,851 --> 00:44:13,353
We will divide into two groups,

604
00:44:13,354 --> 00:44:16,356
each to do his duty from
this day until death.

605
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,052
The able-bodied men
are to come forward

606
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,361
to the right of this building.

607
00:44:21,362 --> 00:44:23,363
We will move from the
village to the hills

608
00:44:23,364 --> 00:44:25,365
and take our position
as guerrillas.

609
00:44:25,366 --> 00:44:27,367
I will go immediately

610
00:44:27,368 --> 00:44:31,372
to Comrade Commander
Petrov's Garrison to get the guns.

611
00:44:33,374 --> 00:44:37,377
The second group has
the hardest job.

612
00:44:37,378 --> 00:44:39,881
They must stay behind.

613
00:44:41,382 --> 00:44:43,885
As guerrillas, we must
have aid and information.

614
00:44:45,386 --> 00:44:49,891
As villagers, you must, before
the entrance of the Germans,

615
00:44:50,391 --> 00:44:52,392
destroy everything.

616
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:53,893
Everything, comrades.

617
00:44:53,894 --> 00:44:56,396
The houses you have built,

618
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,398
the crops you have
sowed with your hands,

619
00:44:58,399 --> 00:45:01,401
the cattle you have raised.

620
00:45:01,402 --> 00:45:04,906
The Germans are not more
than 50 miles away.

621
00:45:05,906 --> 00:45:09,409
Yours is the dangerous job.

622
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,413
For this job, you
will volunteer.

623
00:45:13,414 --> 00:45:16,781
It is you who may have
to live with the...

624
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:21,422
...the Germans.

625
00:45:37,812 --> 00:45:40,312
"I, who am about to become
a guerrilla fighter

626
00:45:40,441 --> 00:45:43,443
of the Soviet Union, I
take this solemn oath."

627
00:45:43,444 --> 00:45:46,446
I, who am about to become
a guerrilla fighter

628
00:45:46,447 --> 00:45:50,450
of the Soviet Union, I
take this solemn oath.

629
00:45:50,451 --> 00:45:52,952
"I will not lay down these arms

630
00:45:52,953 --> 00:45:55,456
until the last fascist is
driven from our land."

631
00:45:55,956 --> 00:45:58,459
I will not lay down these arms

632
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:01,961
until the last fascist
is driven from our land.

633
00:46:01,962 --> 00:46:05,965
"I am willing to give my
life, to die in battle

634
00:46:05,966 --> 00:46:08,469
to keep my people from
fascist slavery."

635
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:13,473
I am willing to give my
life, to die in battle

636
00:46:13,474 --> 00:46:17,478
to keep my people
from fascist slavery.

637
00:46:44,004 --> 00:46:46,005
You know where we'll be.

638
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:50,009
One of us will come every
night to the pine grove.

639
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,012
Remember, we'll need
supplies and information.

640
00:46:53,013 --> 00:46:56,516
This is our land, our village!

641
00:46:56,517 --> 00:47:00,021
We remember we fought another
war to make them ours.

642
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:02,522
We swear to give our
lives if they be needed.

643
00:47:02,523 --> 00:47:05,026
We swear!

I'm ready, Comrade Petrov.

661
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:37,617
Good. Now, just a moment.

662
00:48:37,618 --> 00:48:39,619
These reports show the
Germans rapidly advancing

663
00:48:39,620 --> 00:48:40,620
across our territory.

664
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:42,622
By nightfall, there
won't be a highway

665
00:48:42,623 --> 00:48:44,125
free of their guns,
their tanks,

666
00:48:44,126 --> 00:48:46,626
and their supply trucks,
all going to the front.

667
00:48:46,627 --> 00:48:48,387
Remember, you have a
good 40 miles to travel.

668
00:48:48,629 --> 00:48:50,131
Your best chance is to
take to the back road.

669
00:48:50,132 --> 00:48:51,631
That'll take too long.

670
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:53,134
I'll have to take a
chance on the highway.

671
00:48:53,135 --> 00:48:55,134
We need that ammunition
bad and quick.

672
00:48:55,135 --> 00:48:57,637
I'll get the truck through.
You can count on it.

673
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:59,140
Good.

674
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,652
Comrade Karp is going
to take my place.

675
00:49:12,653 --> 00:49:15,156
My duty is to report to
the nearest airfield.

676
00:49:15,157 --> 00:49:17,657
So gather around,
listen closely,

677
00:49:17,962 --> 00:49:19,790
and I'll show you what I
think is your only chance

678
00:49:19,816 --> 00:49:20,986
to get back to the village.

679
00:49:21,612 --> 00:49:24,115
The Germans must have crossed
the river at the upper bend,

680
00:49:24,116 --> 00:49:26,116
and --

681
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:30,621
get down, everybody!

682
00:50:33,183 --> 00:50:34,685
Father!

683
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:38,188
Kolya.

684
00:50:40,691 --> 00:50:43,192
Damian.

685
00:50:43,193 --> 00:50:45,695
Get the guns out.

686
00:50:45,696 --> 00:50:47,698
Save the guns.

687
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:50,701
Get them out.

688
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,212
Get these boxes out!

689
00:51:08,218 --> 00:51:10,219
Did you do it?

690
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:11,721
Yes, Father.

691
00:51:11,722 --> 00:51:13,224
They're safe.

692
00:51:14,725 --> 00:51:17,226
For our men.

693
00:51:17,227 --> 00:51:19,730
Take it to them.

694
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:25,735
They're... They're at
the end of the stream.

695
00:51:25,736 --> 00:51:27,737
Other side,

696
00:51:27,738 --> 00:51:30,239
Obmyk Hill...

697
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,745
Beyond the pinewoods, past...

698
00:51:36,246 --> 00:51:38,749
Take it back to them.

699
00:51:39,249 --> 00:51:40,249
You hear me?

700
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:42,752
Yes, Father. We'll
take it back.

701
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:48,259
Say hello to... To
your mother for me.

702
00:52:15,786 --> 00:52:18,789
I promise.

703
00:52:48,747 --> 00:52:50,372
Well, that's all of it.

704
00:52:51,263 --> 00:52:53,322
I'll say goodbye now.

705
00:52:53,323 --> 00:52:55,324
Travel at night and
stick to the woods.

706
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:57,326
When you get to the
upper crossroads,

707
00:52:57,327 --> 00:52:59,328
you'll see a little --
but what about you?

708
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:00,830
You said the Germans
had crossed the river.

709
00:53:00,831 --> 00:53:02,832
How can you get
to the airfield?

710
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:05,835
I'll get through all right.

711
00:53:05,836 --> 00:53:08,337
Now, do your best.

712
00:53:08,338 --> 00:53:10,339
Don't be frightened.

713
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,344
Fear is a bad enemy -- or
so people have told me.

714
00:53:15,141 --> 00:53:16,345
Bye, Clavdia.

715
00:53:16,346 --> 00:53:18,348
Goodbye, Kolya.

716
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,352
Marina.

717
00:53:24,855 --> 00:53:27,857
We'll do the best we can.
That's all.

718
00:53:27,858 --> 00:53:29,860
Tell Mother that...

719
00:53:38,869 --> 00:53:39,869
Grisha.

720
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,872
Goodbye, Kolya.

721
00:53:43,874 --> 00:53:45,876
Look after them, Karp.

722
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:12,903
Twenty-five years ago, we
fought and died for this earth.

723
00:54:15,405 --> 00:54:16,906
People go forward.

724
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:18,409
They fight for themselves

725
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:20,409
and make things better
for themselves --

726
00:54:20,410 --> 00:54:25,915
more food, a good bed, jokes
to make and time to laugh.

727
00:54:25,916 --> 00:54:28,419
Then the filthy come
and try to stop it.

728
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,919
They want to take
away from people

729
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,423
all the good they've made
for themselves.

730
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:37,927
Well... Then you take your gun

731
00:54:37,928 --> 00:54:41,432
and you fight until
you've killed all such.

732
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:45,935
Ready, comrades?

733
00:54:45,936 --> 00:54:47,436
Yes, comrade.

734
00:54:47,437 --> 00:54:48,939
We're ready.

735
00:55:07,958 --> 00:55:10,960
We are ordered to occupy
the North Star village.

736
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:12,962
How big is this village?

737
00:55:12,963 --> 00:55:14,465
Not big.

738
00:55:14,965 --> 00:55:17,468
We're only taking
125 men to hold it.

739
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:20,970
We are ordered to establish
a regimental field hospital

740
00:55:20,971 --> 00:55:23,472
in the village
North Star ahead.

741
00:55:23,473 --> 00:55:26,475
Field hospital and a
village dispensary.

742
00:55:26,476 --> 00:55:28,978
How can I take care of all
these men and more to come?

743
00:55:28,979 --> 00:55:30,481
The order says that
more ambulances

744
00:55:30,482 --> 00:55:31,981
and doctors will
be sent to us.

745
00:55:31,982 --> 00:55:33,482
I don't want doctors.

746
00:55:33,483 --> 00:55:34,984
I need surgeons.

747
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:38,489
The colonel has forgotten me.
I am a surgeon.

748
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:44,493
A surgeon is a man who can
operate, Dr. Richter.

749
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:46,496
I have not forgotten you.

750
00:55:54,004 --> 00:55:58,007
Dr. Richter, where did you
take your medical training?

751
00:55:58,008 --> 00:56:01,011
Freiburg, as I have told the
colonel many times before.

752
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:04,514
That was a good school.

753
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:06,255
I must beg the
colonel's pardon.

754
00:56:06,516 --> 00:56:08,517
With respect to the colonel's superior
rank and reputation,

755
00:56:08,518 --> 00:56:10,019
I must beg the
colonel's pardon to --

756
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,022
do not beg my pardon
so often, Dr. Richter.

757
00:56:13,023 --> 00:56:16,025
Good manners do not
make a good surgeon.

758
00:56:16,026 --> 00:56:17,528
It's well known, of course,

759
00:56:17,529 --> 00:56:20,529
the colonel studied at the
University of Leipzig.

760
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:22,531
In the great days.

761
00:56:22,532 --> 00:56:25,535
I was a pupil of freidenthal.

762
00:56:26,536 --> 00:56:27,778
His most famous pupil.

763
00:56:28,348 --> 00:56:30,039
Freidenthal? The Jew?

764
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:32,541
Yes. Freidenthal the Jew.

765
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,543
The colonel did not
mind his being a Jew?

766
00:56:34,544 --> 00:56:36,045
Mind?

767
00:56:36,046 --> 00:56:39,548
I never thought about
it in those days.

768
00:56:40,148 --> 00:56:42,358
It must be pleasant to
be so sure of oneself.

769
00:56:43,037 --> 00:56:44,592
I should like to
think I was as good

770
00:56:44,618 --> 00:56:46,120
as the colonel thinks he is.

771
00:56:47,789 --> 00:56:50,059
The day you think you're as
good as I am, Dr. Richter,

772
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,061
I will know that
you're suffering

773
00:56:52,062 --> 00:56:53,564
from delusions of grandeur

774
00:56:53,565 --> 00:56:56,065
and I shall commit
you to an asylum.

775
00:56:56,066 --> 00:56:58,569
Trust me, Dr. Richter.

776
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:09,571
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!

777
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:18,588
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!

778
00:57:24,094 --> 00:57:26,095
It's hard. The hardest part.

779
00:57:26,096 --> 00:57:28,097
The hardest part.

780
00:57:28,589 --> 00:57:30,091
Go and do it now.

781
00:57:30,185 --> 00:57:33,689
Others give their lives. We
give what is life to us.

782
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:11,900
Look.

783
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:13,403
Another burning village.

784
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:15,622
Speed up. Speed up.

785
00:59:23,834 --> 00:59:25,998
Quite different, isn't
it, Dr. Richter?

786
00:59:26,866 --> 00:59:29,868
The Army of the Third Reich
didn't see burning villages

787
00:59:29,869 --> 00:59:31,870
on its pleasant tour
through Western Europe.

788
00:59:31,871 --> 00:59:32,947
This amuses the colonel?

789
00:59:33,174 --> 00:59:35,874
No. Danger doesn't amuse me.

790
00:59:35,875 --> 00:59:38,443
I only state facts.

791
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:41,880
A strong people. One
has always heard that.

792
00:59:41,881 --> 00:59:45,385
A hard people to conquer.

793
01:01:20,479 --> 01:01:23,482
Silence!

794
01:01:25,484 --> 01:01:27,987
Who is responsible for the
burning and destruction

795
01:01:28,487 --> 01:01:29,488
in this village?

796
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:39,831
Where are the younger men?

797
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,799
They burned it and
have tried to escape.

798
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:48,975
Is that correct?

799
01:02:03,552 --> 01:02:04,919
Has the hospital
been burned down?

800
01:02:05,024 --> 01:02:07,525
It is not bad. We caught it.

801
01:02:07,526 --> 01:02:09,028
Carry in the
casualties immediately

802
01:02:09,528 --> 01:02:11,029
and get the operative
cases ready.

803
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:12,532
As you order, colonel.

804
01:02:20,539 --> 01:02:23,041
The chairman of the Soviet
of this collective farm

805
01:02:23,042 --> 01:02:26,045
is called... Rodion Pavlov.

806
01:02:27,046 --> 01:02:29,048
Is he here?

807
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:33,552
Where is his family?

808
01:02:37,056 --> 01:02:39,057
I wish these
questions answered!

809
01:02:39,058 --> 01:02:41,561
You have already, by the
burning of this village,

810
01:02:41,562 --> 01:02:45,064
shown yourselves to be
enemies of the German army.

811
01:02:46,275 --> 01:02:50,069
We punish our enemies...
Severely.

812
01:02:52,015 --> 01:02:54,518
Where is the wife
of Rodion Pavlov?

813
01:03:00,891 --> 01:03:03,081
I am the wife of
Rodion Pavlov.

814
01:03:03,355 --> 01:03:04,356
Come forward.

815
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:13,092
I wish to know where
your husband is hiding,

816
01:03:13,592 --> 01:03:17,596
how many men he has with him
and how much ammunition.

817
01:03:18,737 --> 01:03:19,690
Yes?

818
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:22,600
I cannot answer
those questions.

819
01:03:22,601 --> 01:03:25,604
You are certain that
you will not answer?

820
01:03:26,605 --> 01:03:28,607
I am certain.

821
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:31,110
Take her inside.

822
01:04:18,157 --> 01:04:22,161
Swine. Swine!

823
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:26,164
I am a doctor.

824
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,666
They will bring her out.

825
01:04:29,051 --> 01:04:31,669
Her right arm and her
right leg will be broken.

826
01:04:31,670 --> 01:04:33,671
You should advise your
people to give information

827
01:04:33,672 --> 01:04:34,673
when it is asked for.

828
01:04:35,174 --> 01:04:36,174
You are a doctor and
you are able to --

829
01:04:36,175 --> 01:04:39,177
in this new order of ours,
we have to countenance

830
01:04:39,178 --> 01:04:42,181
and commit many acts one does
not necessarily approve of.

831
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:21,719
Shh.

832
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:57,255
We'll have a look.

833
01:05:57,521 --> 01:05:59,523
We'll join you at
the crossroads.

834
01:06:27,132 --> 01:06:28,634
Wait.

835
01:06:29,635 --> 01:06:31,136
Take Clavdia and grisha
and hitch the horses.

836
01:06:31,137 --> 01:06:33,138
I can shoot. Do
what I tell you.

837
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:35,642
If anything goes wrong,
then -- well, drive away.

838
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:38,144
Don't wait. Just drive.

839
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:44,651
The horses. Quick.
Hitch the horses.

840
01:06:50,656 --> 01:06:52,657
Frightened?

841
01:06:52,658 --> 01:06:54,659
I...

842
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,661
Yes.

843
01:06:56,662 --> 01:06:58,663
Good.

844
01:06:58,664 --> 01:07:00,665
Only fools aren't frightened

845
01:07:00,666 --> 01:07:03,169
when there's something
to be frightened about.

846
01:07:03,669 --> 01:07:06,672
And I don't like to see
a fool hold a gun.

847
01:07:07,673 --> 01:07:10,175
Now, go on.

848
01:07:10,176 --> 01:07:12,177
And remember --

849
01:07:12,178 --> 01:07:14,179
you'll only have
a second to fire

850
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:16,683
and you must be
quick and sure.

851
01:09:51,337 --> 01:09:53,338
Try to sleep.

852
01:09:53,729 --> 01:09:55,842
I'll watch.

853
01:10:01,347 --> 01:10:02,847
Planes?

854
01:10:02,848 --> 01:10:04,849
It's hard to tell.

855
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:07,852
You get some sleep, my dear.

856
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:11,356
Everything sounds
like planes to me.

857
01:10:11,357 --> 01:10:15,360
I think of Damian
and the children...

858
01:10:16,126 --> 01:10:17,712
Wherever they are.

859
01:10:19,474 --> 01:10:20,867
And Kolya.

860
01:10:26,872 --> 01:10:28,874
You are quiet for you.

861
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,378
I haven't had any
sleep for 30 hours.

862
01:10:32,878 --> 01:10:35,380
I've been on four
bombing trips today.

863
01:10:35,381 --> 01:10:36,881
You're my fifth.

864
01:10:36,882 --> 01:10:38,383
How did you do?

865
01:10:38,384 --> 01:10:41,386
Well, I always do well.

866
01:10:41,387 --> 01:10:45,390
I got two planes...
Whole line of supplies.

867
01:10:45,391 --> 01:10:47,392
Got some big guns
near the river.

868
01:10:47,393 --> 01:10:48,895
Well, get ready
to do it again.

869
01:10:48,921 --> 01:10:50,897
We'll be over them
in three minutes.

870
01:10:50,898 --> 01:10:52,897
We'll see how good you are.

871
01:10:52,898 --> 01:10:54,399
Oh, I'm good.

872
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,402
You must have heard about me.

873
01:10:57,403 --> 01:10:58,903
First flight, son?

874
01:10:58,904 --> 01:11:01,906
This is my first flight
in the war, Grandaddy.

875
01:11:01,907 --> 01:11:03,409
I was at home on leave.

876
01:11:04,910 --> 01:11:06,911
Well, don't get
shaky about it.

877
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:08,914
I'll bring you
through all right.

878
01:11:16,422 --> 01:11:17,922
He talks that way.

879
01:11:17,923 --> 01:11:19,424
I've been flying
with him for years.

880
01:11:19,425 --> 01:11:21,928
I'm used to it.

881
01:11:34,940 --> 01:11:36,942
I can blow those supply trucks.
What do you say?

882
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:38,443
Save your bombs.

883
01:11:38,444 --> 01:11:39,946
This will make a
good strafing job.

884
01:11:39,947 --> 01:11:42,448
We're going down.

885
01:11:51,957 --> 01:11:54,460
Tanks. Tanks in
those trees ahead.

886
01:11:59,965 --> 01:12:02,467
Pilot, are you all right?

887
01:12:02,468 --> 01:12:03,970
Are you all right?!

888
01:12:05,971 --> 01:12:08,974
Gunner, they got the pilot.
Come forward at once.

889
01:12:53,519 --> 01:12:55,019
Sir.

890
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:57,021
Where did you get it?
Are you bad?

891
01:12:57,022 --> 01:12:58,523
I don't know.

892
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:00,024
I can't feel it.

893
01:13:00,025 --> 01:13:03,528
Remember -- years
ago in training?

894
01:13:03,529 --> 01:13:06,032
They said when you couldn't
feel it, it was bad!

895
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:08,533
That's not true. That's all
talk. You hold on.

896
01:13:08,534 --> 01:13:10,535
We'll go over the road and
let go what we got left,

897
01:13:10,536 --> 01:13:12,176
and I'll have on the
ground in 10 minutes.

898
01:13:19,044 --> 01:13:21,546
We're badly clipped in the back.
It's worse than I thought.

899
01:13:21,547 --> 01:13:22,547
You crawl to the back.

900
01:13:22,548 --> 01:13:24,048
I'll let you know
when to bail out.

901
01:13:24,049 --> 01:13:25,550
No, never. Never been
frightened, I mean.

902
01:13:25,551 --> 01:13:27,552
Maybe there's something
the matter with me.

903
01:13:27,553 --> 01:13:29,055
All right. Crawl back now.

904
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:31,055
If you can't open the
hatch, I'll do it for you.

905
01:13:31,056 --> 01:13:33,456
If the plane's too bad to land,
I'm gonna try something else.

906
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:35,400
And it doesn't need more
than one man to do it.

907
01:13:35,561 --> 01:13:37,561
Now, don't argue and sound
brave and be a nuisance.

908
01:13:37,563 --> 01:13:38,563
I can do it alone.

909
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:40,066
Get ready to jump!

910
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,073
Well, you'd never
have made it anyway.

911
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,081
I'll get ready for it.

912
01:13:57,082 --> 01:14:00,585
This is going to be for
my father and for me

913
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:04,090
and for my village and for
people I've never seen.

914
01:14:05,090 --> 01:14:07,592
Those are big words.

915
01:14:07,593 --> 01:14:10,096
I guess I'll have to
stand by them now.

916
01:14:12,097 --> 01:14:14,599
I'm coming down, and
it's going to hurt you!

917
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,601
And I'm coming down
just where I want to

918
01:14:16,602 --> 01:14:19,605
because I was a good bombardier
and a good pilot, too!

919
01:15:02,091 --> 01:15:04,567
The children were given their
supper at the hospital tonight.

920
01:15:04,985 --> 01:15:05,986
Good. They needed it.

921
01:15:06,467 --> 01:15:08,615
It was a good supper
I saw it

922
01:15:09,401 --> 01:15:10,902
Why did they do that?

923
01:15:10,903 --> 01:15:12,904
There's been
nothing but bad bread.

924
01:15:12,905 --> 01:15:14,405
What? What, Anna?

925
01:15:14,406 --> 01:15:17,408
The children are still
at the hospital --

926
01:15:17,409 --> 01:15:20,411
in the hall, on the
benches where I saw them.

927
01:15:20,412 --> 01:15:22,914
Supper was over long ago.
Shh. Shh.

928
01:15:22,915 --> 01:15:24,417
What?

929
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,441
Sasha.

930
01:15:50,442 --> 01:15:51,944
Shh.

931
01:15:54,947 --> 01:15:57,949
He says we are to stay here.

932
01:15:57,950 --> 01:15:59,450
He says we --

933
01:15:59,451 --> 01:16:01,954
Mischa and Sonya
went in there and...

934
01:16:15,968 --> 01:16:17,970
Forceps.

935
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:20,472
Gauze.

936
01:16:33,351 --> 01:16:34,898
No. Don't do that.

937
01:16:38,991 --> 01:16:40,493
No. Don't do that.

938
01:17:01,513 --> 01:17:02,514
Rag.

939
01:17:09,021 --> 01:17:11,022
Orderly!

940
01:17:11,023 --> 01:17:13,524
Guard! Guard!

941
01:17:13,525 --> 01:17:15,526
Guard!

942
01:17:15,527 --> 01:17:18,029
Take this man out. Put
him under arrest.

943
01:17:18,030 --> 01:17:22,033
Do not be so nervous,
Captain Richter.

944
01:17:22,034 --> 01:17:24,535
You are well guarded
in this room

945
01:17:24,536 --> 01:17:27,038
from the feeble attacks
of an old man.

946
01:17:27,715 --> 01:17:28,981
Dismissed!

947
01:17:30,542 --> 01:17:33,045
After you, Dr. Kurin.

948
01:17:34,046 --> 01:17:38,049
I realize that this is difficult
for you to understand.

949
01:17:38,050 --> 01:17:41,053
But our plasma supply
was insufficient,

950
01:17:41,553 --> 01:17:44,555
so we have to take blood for our
wounded where we can get it

951
01:17:44,556 --> 01:17:47,059
and where the donor is
easiest to control.

952
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:51,562
I was looking at your
hospital library today.

953
01:17:51,563 --> 01:17:55,567
I had forgotten that Kurin
the pathologist was Russian.

954
01:17:57,311 --> 01:18:00,072
Strange to find you in
this little village.

955
01:18:01,573 --> 01:18:05,076
You came to the University of
Leipzig to read your paper.

956
01:18:05,077 --> 01:18:08,579
Must have been...
30 years ago.

957
01:18:08,580 --> 01:18:12,083
I was a student, of course,
and not allowed to hear you.

958
01:18:12,388 --> 01:18:14,085
But I remember it.

959
01:18:14,537 --> 01:18:16,087
Cigarette?

960
01:18:16,683 --> 01:18:17,590
They said that men of medicine

961
01:18:17,616 --> 01:18:19,425
see all that can
happen to people.

962
01:18:20,092 --> 01:18:22,595
I'm an old man, and
I have seen much.

963
01:18:23,095 --> 01:18:24,597
But how can a doctor
bring himself

964
01:18:24,598 --> 01:18:26,597
to not only take
blood from children

965
01:18:26,598 --> 01:18:28,099
but to bleed them white?

966
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:31,604
Comrade Kurin.

967
01:18:43,615 --> 01:18:45,117
This boy needs help.

968
01:18:45,617 --> 01:18:47,619
May I? Of course.

969
01:18:57,129 --> 01:18:58,629
Dr. Von Harden,

970
01:18:58,630 --> 01:19:00,631
do you mean that you're not
having this man arrested?

971
01:19:00,632 --> 01:19:03,634
If you wish to be a
warrior, Captain Richter,

972
01:19:03,635 --> 01:19:05,636
you must take chances
with your life.

973
01:19:05,637 --> 01:19:07,638
Dr. Kurin is a famous
man of science.

974
01:19:07,639 --> 01:19:11,643
He's not a man who kills and
therefore no danger to us.

975
01:19:27,659 --> 01:19:30,661
Halt! Who goes there?

976
01:19:30,662 --> 01:19:32,163
It's me -- Dr. Kurin.

977
01:19:32,164 --> 01:19:35,167
Advance to be recognized!

978
01:19:42,174 --> 01:19:43,674
The Kechins' boy.

979
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:45,676
You recognize him, comrade.
Take me to Rodion.

980
01:19:45,677 --> 01:19:46,678
Yeah.

981
01:20:13,705 --> 01:20:16,707
Twenty trucks. Now
start counting.

982
01:20:16,708 --> 01:20:20,211
One, two, three, four, five,

983
01:20:20,212 --> 01:20:22,713
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

984
01:20:22,714 --> 01:20:24,716
Ten seconds. And
here they come.

985
01:20:49,241 --> 01:20:51,242
Twenty trucks,
then 10 seconds.

986
01:20:51,243 --> 01:20:52,745
Eight motorcycles
in 15 seconds.

987
01:20:53,245 --> 01:20:55,748
And more trucks without ammo.

988
01:21:07,759 --> 01:21:09,760
Yes. That's the track.

989
01:21:10,891 --> 01:21:12,763
Karp hasn't seen these
hills for 10 years,

990
01:21:12,764 --> 01:21:15,266
but he remembered
them as if --

991
01:21:15,267 --> 01:21:17,268
we'll go straight through
without stopping,

992
01:21:17,269 --> 01:21:18,769
and we'll be there.

993
01:21:18,770 --> 01:21:20,746
We'll have done our work.

994
01:21:21,774 --> 01:21:23,274
Yes.

995
01:21:23,275 --> 01:21:25,277
Your face has changed.

996
01:21:26,278 --> 01:21:28,810
And yours.

997
01:21:29,615 --> 01:21:32,284
Tired and hungry.

998
01:21:33,285 --> 01:21:35,286
You read about hunger,

999
01:21:35,287 --> 01:21:38,791
but you don't understand how bad
it is until it happens to you.

1000
01:21:38,792 --> 01:21:41,792
If Karp and I can keep awake,
nothing else will matter.

1001
01:21:41,793 --> 01:21:43,294
I can do some of the driving.

1002
01:21:43,295 --> 01:21:44,795
Not this time.

1003
01:21:44,796 --> 01:21:47,298
We'll be climbing.
It'll be hard.

1004
01:21:47,299 --> 01:21:49,300
You'll sleep on my shoulder.

1005
01:21:49,301 --> 01:21:52,805
That'll make me feel
good, sure of myself.

1006
01:21:57,809 --> 01:22:00,311
Could I, Marina?

1007
01:22:00,655 --> 01:22:02,314
I've never...

1008
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:05,317
Could I?

1009
01:22:34,415 --> 01:22:36,454
I'm going through the
woods to this side.

1010
01:22:36,985 --> 01:22:39,350
As their group of motorcycles
come around this turn,

1011
01:22:39,351 --> 01:22:41,352
I'm going to fire at them.

1012
01:22:41,353 --> 01:22:42,855
That'll stop the column.

1013
01:22:42,856 --> 01:22:44,355
You will be ready here.

1014
01:22:44,356 --> 01:22:47,860
As the firing starts, you will
take the wagons across the road.

1015
01:22:47,861 --> 01:22:49,360
The firing will
cover the noise,

1016
01:22:49,361 --> 01:22:52,363
and they'll not be
watching for you.

1017
01:22:52,364 --> 01:22:54,867
They'll be busy with me.

1018
01:22:55,367 --> 01:22:56,368
I hope.

1019
01:23:05,377 --> 01:23:07,378
If two people were
there to fire,

1020
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:08,881
one one side and one another,

1021
01:23:08,882 --> 01:23:10,881
it'll be a better
chance for you.

1022
01:23:10,882 --> 01:23:12,383
I'm coming with you.

1023
01:23:12,688 --> 01:23:14,618
It's not for us to talk of
what's best for one of us.

1024
01:23:15,227 --> 01:23:16,887
You're needed to
take home the guns.

1025
01:23:16,888 --> 01:23:19,381
That's what you must do
and what you will do.

1026
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:22,381
When you hear the
firing, go across.

1027
01:23:22,615 --> 01:23:25,397
When it's over, I'll meet you
on the hill by the cow path.

1028
01:23:27,399 --> 01:23:29,902
On the hill by the cow path.

1029
01:23:38,410 --> 01:23:40,913
He's right, Marina.
It's the only way.

1030
01:24:22,454 --> 01:24:23,954
Soon now.

1031
01:24:23,955 --> 01:24:26,957
When you hear the firing, go
across as fast as you can.

1032
01:24:26,958 --> 01:24:30,462
And remember to leave room
for me to cross next to you.

1033
01:24:35,467 --> 01:24:37,970
Grisha.

1034
01:24:38,470 --> 01:24:39,470
Where's Clavdia?

1035
01:24:39,471 --> 01:24:40,971
She's gone.

1036
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:43,474
She went after Damian.

1037
01:24:43,475 --> 01:24:45,476
I saw her.

1038
01:24:45,477 --> 01:24:47,978
Grisha.

1039
01:24:49,205 --> 01:24:51,246
Why didn't you -- I
must go find her.

1040
01:24:51,309 --> 01:24:53,351
You must not go after her.
You must let her alone.

1041
01:24:53,895 --> 01:24:55,289
I saw her face.

1042
01:25:43,994 --> 01:25:45,375
Oh, Grandpa.

1043
01:25:45,696 --> 01:25:46,387
Anna.

1044
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:48,540
Oh, somebody help me.

1045
01:25:49,935 --> 01:25:53,545
Make me do something right,
the way everybody else does.

1046
01:25:55,046 --> 01:25:57,549
Keep me from being
so frightened.

1047
01:25:59,769 --> 01:26:03,055
Keep me from crying, please.

1048
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:33,273
Where are you hit?

1049
01:28:34,095 --> 01:28:36,097
Bad?

1050
01:28:41,212 --> 01:28:43,214
There are only two --

1051
01:28:53,725 --> 01:28:56,728
don't go, Marina. Wait
a few more minutes.

1052
01:29:06,237 --> 01:29:09,239
A dead kid and a fat girl.

1053
01:29:09,240 --> 01:29:12,743
All right. Signal
to them to go on.

1054
01:29:12,744 --> 01:29:15,247
The dangerous enemy
has been dealt with.

1055
01:29:15,248 --> 01:29:16,748
I'm going.

1056
01:29:17,248 --> 01:29:19,751
Stay here.

1057
01:29:47,278 --> 01:29:49,280
Blind.

1058
01:29:58,289 --> 01:30:02,293
Clavdia?

1059
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:51,628
Come on. We just have time.

1060
01:31:05,503 --> 01:31:06,704
Is it bad?

1061
01:31:06,730 --> 01:31:07,858
No wounds on him.

1062
01:31:08,991 --> 01:31:09,796
Clavdia.

1063
01:31:09,843 --> 01:31:10,827
It's me -- Marina.

1064
01:31:10,859 --> 01:31:11,862
And Karp.

1065
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:12,863
Clavdia.

1066
01:31:12,864 --> 01:31:15,866
Cla-- where is she?

1067
01:31:16,784 --> 01:31:19,870
Clavdia.

1068
01:31:19,871 --> 01:31:21,872
She's dead.

1069
01:31:21,873 --> 01:31:23,375
Clavdia.

1070
01:31:58,409 --> 01:31:59,410
Marina?

1071
01:31:59,911 --> 01:32:01,411
Yes?

1072
01:32:01,412 --> 01:32:02,412
Where are we?

1073
01:32:02,413 --> 01:32:04,915
Over the Yunageno Hills.

1074
01:32:04,916 --> 01:32:06,416
How much longer?

1075
01:32:06,417 --> 01:32:09,419
Not much more.

1076
01:32:09,420 --> 01:32:12,422
What time is it?

1077
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:14,925
About 5:00.

1078
01:32:15,946 --> 01:32:17,429
5:00.

1079
01:32:19,321 --> 01:32:21,933
In the morning or --
or in the afternoon?

1080
01:32:57,842 --> 01:32:59,844
All right! All right!

1081
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:02,493
You say Boris has not
come with the guns,

1082
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:04,367
but they are your children, and
they're being bled to death!

1083
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:07,400
Why, the whole
village will be --

1084
01:33:07,426 --> 01:33:09,929
our time has come to fight.

1085
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:11,871
It does no good for me to lie.

1086
01:33:12,431 --> 01:33:16,435
Men with rocks and clubs are
not good against machine guns.

1087
01:33:16,623 --> 01:33:18,975
Now, there will be
five men to a gun.

1088
01:33:19,112 --> 01:33:20,916
You know it, and I'll say it.

1089
01:33:21,025 --> 01:33:23,691
This may be the last time
we ride down a hill.

1090
01:33:23,783 --> 01:33:24,944
What do you say?

1091
01:33:26,946 --> 01:33:29,449
All right. Saddle your horses.

1092
01:33:31,951 --> 01:33:33,952
Take up your watch
at the pine grove.

1093
01:33:33,953 --> 01:33:35,954
And when Boris gets
here with the guns,

1094
01:33:35,955 --> 01:33:37,325
rush him down to the
north cornfield.

1095
01:33:37,356 --> 01:33:39,959
Pray that he arrives in time.

1096
01:34:25,504 --> 01:34:28,007
All right. The selected
men, dismount.

1097
01:34:31,010 --> 01:34:35,013
The rest of you wait here
until you see the gas aflame,

1098
01:34:35,014 --> 01:34:37,517
and then ride to the
schoolyard and ride fast.

1099
01:34:37,518 --> 01:34:40,519
Barricade it soon as you get in.

1100
01:34:54,533 --> 01:34:56,034
You know the plan.

1101
01:34:56,035 --> 01:34:58,536
Each group knows what to do.

1102
01:34:58,537 --> 01:34:59,538
Now let's do it.

1103
01:36:52,151 --> 01:36:53,746
All right. Now for
the gasoline.

1104
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:56,656
Let's keep it pouring.

1105
01:38:27,746 --> 01:38:29,747
Down! We are fighting
in the village!

1106
01:38:29,748 --> 01:38:30,749
I'll take you!

1107
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:53,773
They're our men!
They've come to fight.

1108
01:39:28,307 --> 01:39:31,310
Sophia, Nadya, our
children are home!

1109
01:39:32,311 --> 01:39:33,811
The children!

1110
01:39:33,812 --> 01:39:34,813
Nadya!

1111
01:39:48,819 --> 01:39:49,504
Grisha.

1112
01:39:49,530 --> 01:39:50,272
Anna!

1113
01:39:50,303 --> 01:39:51,881
My baby is home!

1114
01:39:57,336 --> 01:39:58,838
Damian, it's your mother.

1115
01:39:58,839 --> 01:40:00,839
Damian!

1116
01:40:11,850 --> 01:40:14,353
Mama.

1117
01:40:19,358 --> 01:40:21,360
Mama.

1118
01:40:30,046 --> 01:40:31,869
Grandpa!

1119
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:32,871
Gran--

1120
01:42:05,464 --> 01:42:07,967
I have come for another
visit, Dr. Von Harden.

1121
01:42:07,968 --> 01:42:09,968
I'll only be a minute, doctor.

1122
01:42:12,471 --> 01:42:14,473
Sulfanilamide.

1123
01:42:21,480 --> 01:42:23,482
Come in, Dr. Kurin.

1124
01:42:26,985 --> 01:42:30,488
You do not like Dr. Richter.

1125
01:42:30,489 --> 01:42:33,993
I do not like
incompetent doctors.

1126
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:37,495
I do not like much
of what I have done

1127
01:42:37,496 --> 01:42:38,497
for the past nine years.

1128
01:42:38,997 --> 01:42:41,999
You do not like bleeding
children to their death?

1129
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,000
The boy died?

1130
01:42:43,001 --> 01:42:45,503
You knew he would die!

1131
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:48,007
They took too much blood.

1132
01:42:48,507 --> 01:42:50,508
I am sorry for that.

1133
01:42:50,509 --> 01:42:55,012
Yes, I believe you when
you tell me you're sorry.

1134
01:42:55,013 --> 01:42:59,017
I'm sorry for many
things, Dr. Kurin.

1135
01:43:00,018 --> 01:43:02,520
Most sorry that it isn't
the world we used to know.

1136
01:43:02,521 --> 01:43:05,523
I have heard about
men like you --

1137
01:43:05,524 --> 01:43:09,026
civilized men who are sorry.

1138
01:43:09,027 --> 01:43:11,028
This?

1139
01:43:11,029 --> 01:43:13,030
This kind is nothing.

1140
01:43:13,031 --> 01:43:17,034
They will go when
their bosses go.

1141
01:43:17,035 --> 01:43:22,039
But men like you, who have
contempt for men like him --

1142
01:43:22,040 --> 01:43:25,543
to me, you are the real filth.

1143
01:43:26,059 --> 01:43:30,047
Men who do the work of fascists
while they pretend to themselves

1144
01:43:30,048 --> 01:43:34,051
that they are better than the
beasts for whom they work.

1145
01:43:34,052 --> 01:43:35,553
Men who do murder

1146
01:43:35,554 --> 01:43:39,558
while they laugh at those
who order them to do it.

1147
01:43:40,058 --> 01:43:43,562
It is men like you who have sold
their people to men like him.

1148
01:43:45,564 --> 01:43:47,565
You see, Dr. Von Harden,

1149
01:43:47,566 --> 01:43:50,569
you were wrong
about many things.

1150
01:43:51,069 --> 01:43:53,572
I am a man who kills.

1151
01:44:12,879 --> 01:44:15,067
You, uh, feel you'll
need this thing, huh?

1152
01:44:15,761 --> 01:44:17,595
I like it.

1153
01:44:17,596 --> 01:44:20,598
We will come home someday.

1154
01:44:20,599 --> 01:44:23,100
I want to sew again.

1155
01:44:23,101 --> 01:44:26,604
And you will want to
write your book again.

1156
01:44:26,605 --> 01:44:28,607
We are not so old.

1157
01:44:34,613 --> 01:44:37,116
They tell me you were
very brave, Grandpa.

1158
01:44:37,117 --> 01:44:38,116
And why not, child?

1159
01:44:38,117 --> 01:44:40,619
I'm of the same blood
as you and Clavdia.

1160
01:44:44,623 --> 01:44:46,123
It's gone.

1161
01:44:46,124 --> 01:44:48,626
There will be another someday.

1162
01:44:48,627 --> 01:44:49,627
Yes.

1163
01:44:49,628 --> 01:44:51,630
It will be different for us.

1164
01:44:52,130 --> 01:44:54,632
Wars don't leave
people as they were.

1165
01:44:55,234 --> 01:44:56,634
All people will learn this

1166
01:44:56,635 --> 01:45:00,638
and come to see that
wars do not have to be.

1167
01:45:01,404 --> 01:45:04,143
We'll make this the last war.

1168
01:45:05,143 --> 01:45:08,647
We'll make a free
world for all men.

1169
01:45:10,148 --> 01:45:15,153
The Earth belongs to us, the
people, if we fight for it.

1170
01:45:17,021 --> 01:45:19,023
And we will fight for it!

1171
01:45:28,262 --> 01:45:30,764
♪ Our forest, our river ♪

1172
01:45:30,765 --> 01:45:33,266
♪ We'll fight for
land and home ♪

1173
01:45:33,267 --> 01:45:38,772
