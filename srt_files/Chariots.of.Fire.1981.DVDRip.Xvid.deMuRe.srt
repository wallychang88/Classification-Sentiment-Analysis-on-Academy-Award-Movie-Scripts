1
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:53,784
<i>Let us praise famous men...</i>

2
00:00:54,675 --> 00:00:56,666
<i>... and our fathers that begat us.</i>

3
00:00:58,555 --> 00:01:00,511
<i>All these men...</i>

4
00:01:00,595 --> 00:01:02,745
<i>... were honoured in their generations...</i>

5
00:01:02,835 --> 00:01:06,589
<i>... and were a glory in their days.</i>

6
00:01:06,675 --> 00:01:10,463
We are here today to give thanks...

7
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:13,752
...for the life of Harold Abrahams.

8
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:18,148
To honour the legend.

9
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:21,663
Now there are just two of us -

10
00:01:21,755 --> 00:01:24,144
young Aubrey Montague...

11
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:26,385
...and myself -

12
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,864
who can close our eyes...

13
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,868
...and remember those few young men...

14
00:01:32,955 --> 00:01:35,344
...with hope in our hearts...

15
00:01:35,435 --> 00:01:38,871
<i>... and wings on our heels.</i>

16
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:13,073
<i> Cariton Hotel, Broadstairs, Kent.</i>

17
00:04:13,155 --> 00:04:15,146
<i>28th June, 1924.</i>

18
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:19,746
<i>Dear Mum. I'm most awfully sorry about</i>
<i>your cold and the general dreariness.</i>

19
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:22,303
<i>We're also having</i>
<i>quite bad weather here, too.</i>

20
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:25,751
<i>Thanks for your letters.</i>
<i>I'm sorry you and Pa are disappointed...</i>

21
00:04:25,835 --> 00:04:29,510
<i>... I should be letting the Olympic Games</i>
<i>interfere with my shorthand.</i>

22
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:33,793
<i>But if you were my age, with a chance</i>
<i>to win the Worid Championship in Paris...</i>

23
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:36,150
<i>... you would be just as big a fool as I am.</i>

24
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:40,592
<i>By the way, it's awfully kind of Pa</i>
<i>to finance me here, in spite of my idiocy.</i>

25
00:04:40,675 --> 00:04:44,668
<i>It's marvellous for esprit de corps.</i>
<i>Most of the chaps have managed to get down.</i>

26
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:47,633
- Cricket, Montague, in the ballroom.
- Now!

27
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:50,906
No ball!

28
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:52,986
Come on, Aubrey, the old leg break.

29
00:05:03,515 --> 00:05:06,473
- Howzat!
- Not out.

30
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:08,944
What? You could hear it
in bloody Bournemouth!

31
00:05:09,035 --> 00:05:11,595
- Come on, Liddell, my innings.
- I didn't touch it.

32
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:15,224
- You heard the crack of my wrist.
- I saw the bloody thing bend! Andy!

33
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,226
No tickle for me.

34
00:05:17,315 --> 00:05:20,273
He's out, I tell you.
You're all deaf and bloody blind.

35
00:05:20,355 --> 00:05:22,949
Aubrey, I ask you, for God's sake!

36
00:05:26,835 --> 00:05:28,826
It's not fair!

37
00:05:34,115 --> 00:05:35,912
All right.

38
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:41,504
<i> Harold's here. As intense as ever.</i>

39
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:44,553
<i>Just as he was</i>
<i>on our very first day at Cambridge.</i>

40
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,626
<i>I remember we shared a taxi together.</i>

41
00:06:12,635 --> 00:06:14,626
I'll take these.

42
00:06:18,315 --> 00:06:20,385
- See you inside, Aubrey.
- Right.

43
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,385
Thank you.

44
00:06:28,675 --> 00:06:30,666
- Name, please.
- We're new.

45
00:06:30,755 --> 00:06:32,871
I can see that, laddie. What's your name?

46
00:06:32,955 --> 00:06:34,946
Abrahams. HM.

47
00:06:35,555 --> 00:06:39,070
- Top of the list. Repton. That the one?
- That's it. Left a year ago.

48
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:42,625
- Been doing your bit, 'ave you? France?
- No. Joined too late.

49
00:06:42,715 --> 00:06:44,307
Bad luck, lad.

50
00:06:44,395 --> 00:06:46,863
Many a dead man
would have liked a share of it.

51
00:06:46,955 --> 00:06:48,946
You're right there, son.

52
00:06:49,795 --> 00:06:52,025
Welcome to Caius.

53
00:06:52,915 --> 00:06:56,430
- Sign here.
- Thank you.

54
00:06:56,515 --> 00:07:00,394
It's across the courtyard,
top right-hand corner, up the stairs.

55
00:07:00,475 --> 00:07:01,874
Thanks.

56
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,513
By the way, what are your names?

57
00:07:03,595 --> 00:07:06,905
Rogers, head porter,
and this is Mr Ratcliffe, my assistant.

58
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:08,986
Well, Mr Rogers, Ratcliffe...

59
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:12,306
...I ceased to be a "laddie" when
I took up the King's commissión.

60
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:15,546
- Is that clear?
- Yes... Mr Abrahams.

61
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:17,546
- Quite clear.
- Thank you.

62
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:20,024
I'd be obliged if you'd remember it.

63
00:07:20,115 --> 00:07:22,106
- See you later.
- Fine.

64
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:26,349
What's your friend studying, then, son?

65
00:07:26,435 --> 00:07:28,426
Barrack-room law?

66
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,946
- I've no idea.
- Mm.

67
00:07:31,035 --> 00:07:32,673
One thing's certain.

68
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:37,306
A name like Abrahams, he won't be
in the chapel choir, now, will he?

69
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:39,511
- Name?
- Montague.

70
00:07:39,595 --> 00:07:41,586
- What?
- Montague.

71
00:08:28,715 --> 00:08:30,751
I take the war list...

72
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,826
...and I run down it.

73
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:36,749
Name after name which I cannot read...

74
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:40,066
...and which we, who are older than you...

75
00:08:40,155 --> 00:08:42,749
...cannot hear, without emotion.

76
00:08:44,235 --> 00:08:47,068
Names which will be only names to you...

77
00:08:47,155 --> 00:08:49,146
...the new college.

78
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:53,911
But which to us summon up face after face...

79
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:59,023
...full of honesty and goodness...

80
00:08:59,115 --> 00:09:00,912
...zeal and vigour...

81
00:09:00,995 --> 00:09:03,668
...and intellectual promise.

82
00:09:05,195 --> 00:09:07,311
The flower of a generation.

83
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,351
The glory of England...

84
00:09:09,435 --> 00:09:11,426
...and they died for England...

85
00:09:11,515 --> 00:09:13,745
...and all that England stands for.

86
00:09:14,835 --> 00:09:18,987
And now by tragic necessity,
their dreams have become yours.

87
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:22,827
Let me exhort you. Examine yourselves.

88
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:24,906
Let each of you discover...

89
00:09:24,995 --> 00:09:28,032
...where your true chance of greatness lies.

90
00:09:28,755 --> 00:09:30,746
For their sakes...

91
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:35,113
...for the sake of your college
and your country, seize this chance.

92
00:09:35,195 --> 00:09:37,186
Rejoice in it...

93
00:09:37,275 --> 00:09:41,553
...and let no power or persuasión
deter you in your task.

94
00:09:44,675 --> 00:09:47,508
<i> Thursday, October 10th, 1919.</i>

95
00:09:47,595 --> 00:09:49,950
<i>My first day at Cambridge was rounded off...</i>

96
00:09:50,035 --> 00:09:52,754
<i>... by the freshmen's dinner,</i>
<i>a sumptuous affair.</i>

97
00:09:52,835 --> 00:09:54,985
<i>The master gave us a moving speech...</i>

98
00:09:55,075 --> 00:09:58,590
<i>... and I'm now eagerly awaiting</i>
<i>the start of term proper.</i>

99
00:09:58,955 --> 00:10:01,594
Rugby club, golfing society, tennis...

100
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:04,553
...squash club, flora and fauna, philately.

101
00:10:04,635 --> 00:10:06,626
Is that all? You're an idle man!

102
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:10,469
- I've got to work some time.
- Try bird-watching. You can take a book.

103
00:10:10,555 --> 00:10:12,546
How can I watch if I'm reading a book?

104
00:10:12,635 --> 00:10:15,388
Follow in the footsteps of WG.
Any Yorkshiremen here?

105
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:17,386
I can't bat for toffee.

106
00:10:19,275 --> 00:10:21,072
# Upon the battle scene

107
00:10:21,155 --> 00:10:22,793
# They fight the foe together

108
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,672
# There every mother's son

109
00:10:24,755 --> 00:10:26,871
# Prepared to fight or fall is

110
00:10:26,955 --> 00:10:30,345
# The enemy of one the enemy of all is

111
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:34,544
# The enemy of one the enemy of all is

112
00:10:35,395 --> 00:10:37,545
- Abrahams, HM.
- Can you manage a tenor?

113
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:40,866
- We're desperately short of tenors.
- Only under torture.

114
00:10:40,955 --> 00:10:43,753
- Aubrey. Sing, do you?
- School choir, that's all.

115
00:10:43,835 --> 00:10:45,234
You, Stallard?

116
00:10:45,315 --> 00:10:47,670
They kicked me out of <i>Ring-a-ring o'Roses.</i>

117
00:10:47,755 --> 00:10:49,905
Sorry about that. We can't all be gifted.

118
00:10:49,995 --> 00:10:52,225
# If everybody's somebody

119
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,465
# Then no one's anybody

120
00:10:54,555 --> 00:10:56,910
- Put my friend here down as well.
- Steady on.

121
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:59,714
Splendid! Rehearsals start on Monday.
<i>Iolanthe.</i>

122
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:03,868
- I was a boy alto.
- Perfect! You can be Queen of the Fairies.

123
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,264
Where were you
when your country needed you?

124
00:11:06,355 --> 00:11:10,633
We have a duty, a solemn duty, to those
millions of lives needlessly slaughtered!

125
00:11:10,715 --> 00:11:13,434
# When the boys are far away

126
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:17,986
# They dream of home

127
00:11:19,115 --> 00:11:21,106
Well, glad to have you, Stallard.

128
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:23,584
Good middle-distance men
don't grow on trees.

129
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:25,666
I can't vouch for those times.

130
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:29,907
Taken with the school alarm clock,
most of them.

131
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:33,146
Give or take a second,
they're good enough for me.

132
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:37,152
Have you come across a fellow
called Abrahams? HM Abrahams?

133
00:11:37,235 --> 00:11:39,226
He's challenged for the college dash.

134
00:11:39,355 --> 00:11:41,346
What's so special about that?

135
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:44,108
In all the 700 years, nobody's ever done it.

136
00:11:44,195 --> 00:11:45,674
Right, what do you do?

137
00:12:02,195 --> 00:12:04,425
Right, chaps, thank you! Thank you.

138
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,513
Let it be known that HM Abrahams
of Gonville and Caius...

139
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:11,473
...has formally made challenge
for the college dash.

140
00:12:12,875 --> 00:12:14,513
You show 'em, Harold!

141
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:16,870
For those not familiar with the rules...

142
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:20,504
The challenger will attempt
to run around the court perimeter...

143
00:12:20,595 --> 00:12:22,790
...to and from a point beneath the clock...

144
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,753
...within the time taken
by the clock to strike midday.

145
00:12:25,835 --> 00:12:29,544
A distance traditionally
recognised as one of 188 paces.

146
00:12:29,635 --> 00:12:32,945
I say, Abrahams, what have you got
on your feet? Rockets?

147
00:12:33,035 --> 00:12:35,310
The challenge will commence on the...

148
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:38,944
- Abrahams, you haven't got a chance!
- Do it for Israel!

149
00:12:39,035 --> 00:12:41,344
The challenge commences
on the stroke of one.

150
00:12:41,435 --> 00:12:44,313
The challenger must finish
before the stroke of 12.

151
00:12:44,395 --> 00:12:46,386
Come on, Abrahams, you swank!

152
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:48,830
Will the challenger make himself ready?

153
00:12:48,915 --> 00:12:51,713
Whoa!

154
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:59,153
This Abrahams.
What do you know about him?

155
00:12:59,235 --> 00:13:01,146
Repton chap.

156
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:02,463
Jewish.

157
00:13:02,555 --> 00:13:05,786
- His father's a financier in the city.
- Financier?

158
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:08,309
What's that supposed to mean, I wonder?

159
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:10,386
I imagine he lends money.

160
00:13:11,075 --> 00:13:13,066
Exactly.

161
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:15,305
And what do they say about the son?

162
00:13:15,395 --> 00:13:18,228
Academically sound. Arrogant.

163
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:20,226
Defensive to the point of pugnacity.

164
00:13:20,315 --> 00:13:22,783
Mm. As they invariably are.

165
00:13:23,395 --> 00:13:26,228
Yet possessing
a keen sense of duty and loyalty.

166
00:13:29,595 --> 00:13:31,984
Do they say he can run?

167
00:13:32,075 --> 00:13:33,827
Like the wind.

168
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:41,225
Gentlemen, would you draw back, please?
Away from the course.

169
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:42,907
Thank you.

170
00:13:42,995 --> 00:13:44,986
Mr Abrahams, your position, please.

171
00:13:45,755 --> 00:13:48,315
Owing to the absence
of any other challenger...

172
00:13:48,435 --> 00:13:50,232
...Mr Abrahams will run alone.

173
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:52,306
Not so, Mr Starter!

174
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:58,150
Your name and college, if you please, sir.

175
00:13:58,235 --> 00:14:01,033
Lindsay. I race beside my friend here.

176
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:04,630
We challenge in the name
of Repton, Eton and Caius.

177
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:10,110
<i>- </i> I didn't know you ran.
- Nor I you.

178
00:14:10,195 --> 00:14:13,824
Some chap just told me about this.
I thought I'd come and push you along.

179
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:15,394
- Delighted.
- Splendid.

180
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:16,544
Good luck.

181
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:19,433
Gentlemen, to your marks, if you please.

182
00:14:21,475 --> 00:14:24,228
Now remember, on the first strike of 12.

183
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:50,386
Come on!

184
00:15:08,155 --> 00:15:09,952
Eight!

185
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:13,066
Nine!

186
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:16,506
Ten!

187
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,948
- Eleven!
- Go on! Go on!

188
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:36,672
Did they both do it?

189
00:15:36,755 --> 00:15:38,746
I think not.

190
00:15:38,835 --> 00:15:42,145
- Young Lindsay failed by a whisker.
- Pity.

191
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:46,148
<i> Well, it's been done.</i>
<i>And by a Caius man! You must be very proud.</i>

192
00:15:46,235 --> 00:15:48,226
<i>The first man in seven centuries.</i>

193
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:53,309
<i>Perhaps they really are</i>
<i>God's chosen people, after all.</i>

194
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,515
<i>I doubt if there's a swifter man</i>
<i>in the kingdom.</i>

195
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,906
Get to your marks.

196
00:16:06,035 --> 00:16:08,230
Get set.

197
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:47,794
<i> He may be your best friend, Sandy,</i>
<i>but he's my best brother.</i>

198
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:51,026
<i>I'm thinking of him</i>
<i>and not your blessed athletics team.</i>

199
00:16:51,115 --> 00:16:54,027
<i>His heart's set on following Father</i>
<i>in the missión.</i>

200
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:57,107
Do you not think he's busy enough
without taking up racing?

201
00:16:57,195 --> 00:17:00,232
He's fast, Jennie.
You've seen him with a ball in his hands.

202
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,351
I've seen him with a Bible in his hands.

203
00:17:02,435 --> 00:17:04,426
And I know which is the most important.

204
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:06,506
You can't deny him the chance.

205
00:17:06,595 --> 00:17:09,155
Get him on the track, I'm telling you...

206
00:17:09,235 --> 00:17:11,829
Don't tell me, Sandy. I don't want to hear.

207
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:13,871
Eric's special to me. Precious.

208
00:17:13,955 --> 00:17:17,550
I don't want his work spoilt
with all this running talk, do you hear?

209
00:17:26,035 --> 00:17:29,027
There you are. Well done.

210
00:17:36,755 --> 00:17:38,825
You know, ladies and gentlemen...

211
00:17:38,915 --> 00:17:42,430
...one of the compensations
of achieving a certain notoriety...

212
00:17:42,515 --> 00:17:44,153
...if only as a rugby player...

213
00:17:44,235 --> 00:17:47,272
...is that occasionally
you're asked to give things away.

214
00:17:49,155 --> 00:17:51,544
It's often said that giving beats receiving.

215
00:17:51,635 --> 00:17:53,466
Let me tell you -

216
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,149
the look of delight
on those little boys' faces...

217
00:17:56,235 --> 00:18:00,547
...was worth ten of the tin pots gathering
dust on my Edinburgh sideboard.

218
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,470
When we were in China, my father here...

219
00:18:04,555 --> 00:18:08,343
...was always waxing lyrical
about his wee home in the glen.

220
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:11,510
But being oriental-born myself...

221
00:18:11,595 --> 00:18:14,155
...like my brothers and my sister here...

222
00:18:14,235 --> 00:18:16,829
...I suffered from a natural incredulity.

223
00:18:17,915 --> 00:18:19,906
But looking about me now -

224
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:21,986
the heather on the hills -

225
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,465
I can see he was right.

226
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:27,546
It's very special.

227
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,626
Thank you for welcoming us home.

228
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,194
And thank you...

229
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:38,551
...for reminding me that I am,
and will be whilst I breathe...

230
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:42,670
...a Scot.

231
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,545
Mr Provost, sir.

232
00:18:48,635 --> 00:18:51,354
Before you allow Eric here to go...

233
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,634
Is it not true that the main event
of the meeting is still to be run?

234
00:18:55,715 --> 00:18:57,353
It is. Aye.

235
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,551
The 200-yards open championship.

236
00:18:59,635 --> 00:19:03,025
It's the last event
of this gathering, by tradition.

237
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:06,312
Do you not think,
if we can find him some kit...

238
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:10,149
...we might persuade Scotland's
finest wing to show us his paces?

239
00:19:13,155 --> 00:19:15,146
What do you say, Eric?

240
00:19:25,155 --> 00:19:27,385
To your marks!

241
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,794
Get set!

242
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,624
Didn't I tell you, Eric? Didn't I tell you?

243
00:20:43,515 --> 00:20:46,393
Surely a touch of liberality
would do no harm.

244
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:49,831
Sandy, the kingdom of God
is not a democracy.

245
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,383
The Lord never seeks re-election.

246
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,035
There's no discussión, no deliberation...

247
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:57,549
...no referenda as to which road to take.

248
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,471
There's one right, one wrong...

249
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:02,546
...one absolute ruler.

250
00:21:02,635 --> 00:21:07,072
- A dictator, you mean.
- Aye, but a benign, loving dictator.

251
00:21:07,155 --> 00:21:09,669
So much for your freedom of choice.

252
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:11,825
You've still got a choice, Sandy.

253
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:14,865
Nobody's forcing you to follow it.

254
00:21:19,515 --> 00:21:21,710
Ooh! Hey, hey!

255
00:21:22,835 --> 00:21:24,905
- Do you know what day it is?
- Yeah.

256
00:21:24,995 --> 00:21:26,986
- Tell me, then.
- Sunday.

257
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:29,589
The Sabbath's not a day
for playing football, is it?

258
00:21:29,675 --> 00:21:31,154
No.

259
00:21:31,235 --> 00:21:34,386
- Are you up early in the morning?
- Me ma gets me up at seven.

260
00:21:34,475 --> 00:21:36,466
We'll have a game then, then. OK?

261
00:21:36,555 --> 00:21:38,546
Mr Liddell, is it OK if me da comes?

262
00:21:38,635 --> 00:21:40,751
Sure. Bring your whole family.

263
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:42,826
I'll give ye a five-goal start.

264
00:21:42,915 --> 00:21:45,190
You've got a train to catch at nine.

265
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:47,266
There's plenty of time.

266
00:21:47,355 --> 00:21:50,711
Do you want the kid to grow up
thinking God's a spoilsport?

267
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,869
If I may, I'd like to propose a toast.

268
00:21:56,955 --> 00:21:58,593
To the Liddell family...

269
00:21:58,675 --> 00:22:01,143
...whom I'm fortunate enough
to call my friends.

270
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:03,988
The Reverend JD, Mrs L, young Ernest.

271
00:22:04,835 --> 00:22:07,793
<i>Bon voyage</i> and safe journey back to China.

272
00:22:07,875 --> 00:22:10,150
May the years ahead be happy and content.

273
00:22:10,235 --> 00:22:13,466
For those who remain,
may God protect them...

274
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:15,227
...inspire them...

275
00:22:15,315 --> 00:22:17,067
...and lead them to glory.

276
00:22:17,155 --> 00:22:19,225
Thank you, Sandy. That was very nice.

277
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,988
I'm relying on you now
to keep them all out of mischief.

278
00:22:22,075 --> 00:22:26,307
That I will, Mrs L. If they do transgress,
I'll pop the details on a postcard.

279
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:29,353
You can read all about it
before you can say Marco Polo.

280
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,471
Cost you a fortune in postage stamps.

281
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:33,830
Don't worry. I shall protect my investment.

282
00:22:33,915 --> 00:22:36,873
I'm going to rule you with a rod of iron.

283
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:40,750
We're going to have to watch ourselves!

284
00:22:44,315 --> 00:22:46,385
You're a very lucky young man, Eric.

285
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,670
You're the proud possessor of many gifts.

286
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:51,553
And it's your sacred duty
to put them to good use.

287
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:54,991
Dad's right. Run like we know you can,
strong and true.

288
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:57,828
The missión cannot but gain
by your success.

289
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,349
What we need now is a muscular Christian.

290
00:23:01,835 --> 00:23:04,588
To make folks sit up and notice.

291
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,030
How good are you, Eric?

292
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:11,145
Sandy reckons he'll run for Scotland
before the month's out.

293
00:23:11,235 --> 00:23:13,669
Then after that... the sky's the limit.

294
00:23:13,755 --> 00:23:15,188
Meaning what?

295
00:23:16,155 --> 00:23:18,146
The Olympic Games, maybe?

296
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:23,145
Eric, you can praise the Lord
by peeling a spud...

297
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:25,226
...if you peel it to perfection.

298
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:28,466
Don't compromise.
Compromise is a language of the devil.

299
00:23:28,555 --> 00:23:30,511
Run in God's name...

300
00:23:30,595 --> 00:23:33,109
<i>... and let the worid stand back in wonder.</i>

301
00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:50,872
# Lean and his mercy will provide

302
00:23:50,955 --> 00:23:56,393
# Trust and thy trusting soul shall prove

303
00:23:56,875 --> 00:24:02,427
# Christ is its life and Christ its love

304
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:11,263
# <i>Run the straight race</i>

305
00:24:11,355 --> 00:24:14,472
# <i>Through God's good grace</i>

306
00:24:14,915 --> 00:24:16,985
# <i>Lift up thine eyes</i>

307
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:20,545
# <i>And seek his face</i>

308
00:24:20,635 --> 00:24:26,665
# <i>Life with its way before us lies</i>

309
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:36,111
You came to see a race today.

310
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:38,186
To see someone win.

311
00:24:38,595 --> 00:24:40,586
It happened to be me.

312
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:44,148
But I want you to do more
than just watch a race.

313
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:46,906
I want you to take part in it.

314
00:24:47,995 --> 00:24:51,590
I want to compare faith to running in a race.

315
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,946
It's hard.

316
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,265
It requires concentration of will.

317
00:24:57,835 --> 00:24:59,826
Energy of soul.

318
00:25:01,555 --> 00:25:03,432
You experience elation...

319
00:25:03,515 --> 00:25:05,506
...when the winner breaks the tape...

320
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:08,665
...especially if you've got a bet on it.

321
00:25:09,475 --> 00:25:11,466
But how long does that last?

322
00:25:12,075 --> 00:25:14,509
You go home. Maybe your dinner's burnt.

323
00:25:15,595 --> 00:25:17,904
Maybe you haven't got ajob.

324
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:21,106
So who am I to say believe...

325
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:24,388
...have faith, in the face of life's realities?

326
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:29,067
I would like to give you
something more permanent...

327
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,146
...but I can only point the way.

328
00:25:31,715 --> 00:25:34,104
I have no formula for winning the race.

329
00:25:34,555 --> 00:25:36,546
Everyone runs in her own way...

330
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:38,626
...or his own way.

331
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:42,503
And where does the power come from
to see the race to its end?

332
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:46,426
From within.

333
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:49,146
Jesus said...

334
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:52,750
..."Behold, the kingdom of God is within you."

335
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:58,550
"If with all your hearts ye truly seek me...

336
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:00,785
...ye shall ever surely find me."

337
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:03,470
If you commit yourself...

338
00:26:03,555 --> 00:26:05,546
...to the love of Christ...

339
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:09,667
...then <i>that</i> is how you run a straight race.

340
00:26:16,755 --> 00:26:18,950
Cheers. Thanks for coming.

341
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:33,546
It's an ache.

342
00:26:34,835 --> 00:26:36,826
A helplessness.

343
00:26:38,635 --> 00:26:40,626
And an anger.

344
00:26:44,435 --> 00:26:46,426
One feels humiliated.

345
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:55,994
Sometimes I say to myself,
"Steady on, you're imagining all this."

346
00:26:56,755 --> 00:26:58,746
Then I catch that look again.

347
00:26:59,675 --> 00:27:01,666
Catch it on the edge of a remark.

348
00:27:02,475 --> 00:27:04,864
Feel a cold reluctance in a handshake.

349
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:12,906
That's my father.

350
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:14,986
A Lithuanian Jew.

351
00:27:15,475 --> 00:27:17,466
He <i>is</i> alien.

352
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:20,513
- He's as foreign as a frankfurter.
- A kosher one at that!

353
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,426
I love and admire him.

354
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:31,706
He worships this country.

355
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:33,990
From nothing, he built what he believed...

356
00:27:34,075 --> 00:27:36,589
...was enough to make
true Englishmen of his sons.

357
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,546
My brother's a doctor.

358
00:27:43,875 --> 00:27:45,866
A leader in his field.

359
00:27:46,755 --> 00:27:50,464
- Which one is he?
- That's me with the curis, on his back.

360
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:56,986
He wanted for nothing.

361
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,186
And here am I.

362
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:04,551
<i>Setting up shop</i>
<i>in the finest university in the land.</i>

363
00:28:19,795 --> 00:28:21,786
But the old man forgot one thing.

364
00:28:22,555 --> 00:28:24,546
This England of his is Christian...

365
00:28:24,635 --> 00:28:26,626
...and Anglo-Saxon.

366
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,225
And so are her corridors of power.

367
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:34,464
And those who stalk them
guard them with jealousy and venom.

368
00:28:35,475 --> 00:28:38,706
You're right to study law.
You're quite an advocate.

369
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:42,231
A rare ethnic advantage.
It's called the gift of the gab.

370
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:51,315
So what now? Grin and bear it?

371
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:53,306
No, Aubrey.

372
00:28:53,395 --> 00:28:56,034
I'm going to take them on. All of them.

373
00:28:56,595 --> 00:28:58,586
One by one.

374
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:00,946
And run them off their feet.

375
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:10,628
# <i>He is an Englishman!</i>

376
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:16,467
# <i>He is an Englishman</i>

377
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:22,234
# <i>For he himself has said it</i>

378
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:26,354
# <i>And it's greatly to his credit</i>

379
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:30,634
# <i>That he is an Englishman</i>

380
00:29:36,755 --> 00:29:39,223

382
00:29:44,195 --> 00:29:47,426
<i>Clean sweep for Cambridge star.</i>

383
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:50,066
<i>Abrahams hat trick.</i>

384
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:52,146
<i>From a special correspondent.</i>

385
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:07,585

# Englishman

395
00:30:49,915 --> 00:30:51,792
Bravo!

396
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:56,385
Bravo, Harold!

397
00:31:15,755 --> 00:31:18,747
# L'étendard sanglant est levé

398
00:31:19,235 --> 00:31:22,113

00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:26,230

# Entendez-vous dans les campagnes

404
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:50,425
4-1 Liddell! What are you asking?

405
00:31:50,515 --> 00:31:52,506
£25, Liddell to win.

406
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:06,906
Mr Mussabini, I believe.

407
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:10,067
My name's Keddie. Colonel John Keddie.

408
00:32:10,155 --> 00:32:12,430
- I'm...
- President of the Scottish Three A's.

409
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:15,188
I know, and I'm glad to know you, sir.

410
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:17,948
- <i>Ah, monsieur Sam! Bonjour.</i>
- <i>Ah, bonjour.</i>

411
00:32:18,075 --> 00:32:19,633
- How's the leg?
- OK.

412
00:32:19,715 --> 00:32:21,307
Nasty fall you took.

413
00:32:21,435 --> 00:32:23,426
<i>Enchanté.</i> Good luck.

414
00:32:23,555 --> 00:32:25,625
You're very welcome here, of course.

415
00:32:25,715 --> 00:32:28,673
But we do have a strict amateur code.

416
00:32:29,475 --> 00:32:31,466
Colonel, don't worry your head.

417
00:32:31,555 --> 00:32:33,386
I'm here spectating, that's all.

418
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:35,750
Ah, good. I felt sure you would understand.

419
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:38,826
Well, to battle!

420
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,906
I hope you enjoy the games.

421
00:32:41,755 --> 00:32:43,746
Games? You must be joking.

422
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:46,224
I've seen better-organised riots.

423
00:32:46,315 --> 00:32:49,148
Come on, Scotland!

424
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,226
<i>Vive la France!</i>

425
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:01,826
Gentlemen, get to your marks.

426
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,668
Get set.

427
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:22,986
Get up, lad. Get up.

428
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,825
Yeah.

429
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:35,632
He'll never do it.

430
00:33:35,715 --> 00:33:38,070
Don't you believe it. His head's not back yet.

431
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:49,466
Come on, Eric!

432
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:23,946
Get back! Give him air!

433
00:34:26,235 --> 00:34:28,624
Well done, Eric, son. Well done.

434
00:34:28,715 --> 00:34:31,673
He'll be right in ajiffy.
I'll go away and get his clothes.

435
00:34:36,835 --> 00:34:40,225
You take good care
of this lad o' yours, Mr McGrath.

436
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:44,194
Because if you drop him,
you'll never find another one like this.

437
00:34:44,275 --> 00:34:47,312
It's not the prettiest quarter
I've ever seen, Mr Liddell.

438
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:49,386
But certainly the bravest.

439
00:34:49,475 --> 00:34:51,466
Get him up. Come on, gently.

440
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:58,746
Keep your arm around.

441
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:21,346
Mr Mussabini.

442
00:35:23,395 --> 00:35:25,386
Mr Abrahams, is it?

443
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:28,464
So you've travelled 300 mile just to see me?

444
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:30,147
You and Liddell.

445
00:35:30,235 --> 00:35:32,226
I'd heard you were both the best.

446
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:34,306
And what do you think now?

447
00:35:34,395 --> 00:35:36,386
Eric Liddell?

448
00:35:36,475 --> 00:35:39,990
I've never seen such drive,
such commitment in a runner.

449
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,546
He runs like a wild animal.

450
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,353
He unnerves me.

451
00:35:44,435 --> 00:35:46,153
So he should.

452
00:35:46,235 --> 00:35:48,749
He frightens the living daylights out of me.

453
00:35:48,835 --> 00:35:51,474
I want you to help me take him on.

454
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:56,065
Tell me, Mr Abrahams. Are you married?

455
00:35:56,155 --> 00:35:58,146
No. Why?

456
00:35:58,235 --> 00:35:59,634
Well...

457
00:35:59,715 --> 00:36:02,388
...when the right girl comes along...

458
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,626
...how will you feel if she pops the question?

459
00:36:08,195 --> 00:36:10,186
You see, Mr Abrahams...

460
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,152
...like the bridegroom...

461
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:14,624
...it's the coach that should do the asking.

462
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,711
Mr Mussabini...

463
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:19,751
...I can run fast.

464
00:36:19,835 --> 00:36:22,588
With your help, I think I can run even faster.

465
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,905
Perhaps faster than any man ever ran.

466
00:36:25,635 --> 00:36:27,626
I want that Olympic medal.

467
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:30,426
Now, I can see it there.

468
00:36:30,515 --> 00:36:32,631
It's waiting for me.

469
00:36:32,715 --> 00:36:34,706
But I can't get it on my own.

470
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:43,469
Well, we've an old saying in my game, son.

471
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:46,511
You can't put in what God's left out.

472
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:49,232
Now, you leave it to me.

473
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:52,546
I'll watch you. I'll observe.
And if I think I can help -

474
00:36:53,715 --> 00:36:56,275
if I can see the big prize hanging there -

475
00:36:56,355 --> 00:36:58,744
believe me, I won't waste any time.

476
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:01,110
When we meet again...

477
00:37:01,195 --> 00:37:03,186
...l'll be the one that does the begging.

478
00:37:03,275 --> 00:37:05,152
So you will watch me?

479
00:37:05,235 --> 00:37:07,226
Son, if you're good enough...

480
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:11,434
...l'll take you apart piece by bloody piece.

481
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:14,066
Thank you.

- She's magnificent.

501
00:38:25,315 --> 00:38:27,704
Bravo! Bravo!

502
00:38:40,635 --> 00:38:42,432
I think it's going rather well.

503
00:38:42,515 --> 00:38:45,268
I've never seen this sort of thing,
but I am enjoying it.

504
00:38:45,355 --> 00:38:47,630
- And you, JB?
- I've done better shows myself.

505
00:38:47,715 --> 00:38:50,388
- Do you remember them offhand?
- I don't!

506
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:52,670
So the stone heart's frail after all.

507
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:55,872
- Abrahams is smitten, you say?
- Smitten? He's decapitated.

508
00:38:55,955 --> 00:38:58,674
- He won't listen to reason.
- The poor lad's in love!

509
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:01,872
He's only just set eyes on her.
I've worshipped her for years.

510
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:05,152
- By the way, where is he now?
- He's gone to ask her out to dinner.

511
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:08,108
- Has he, by Jove!
- In the interval?!

512
00:39:08,915 --> 00:39:11,793
- Thank you. Mine, I take it?
- Ah, Harold.

513
00:39:12,835 --> 00:39:14,826
Lovely.

514
00:39:17,395 --> 00:39:18,384
Well?

515
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:20,545
- Well what?
- Did you speak to her?

516
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:21,670
Yes.

517
00:39:21,755 --> 00:39:23,188
- Is she coming?
- Yes.

518
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:25,345
- To dinner?
- Yes.

519
00:39:25,435 --> 00:39:28,791
Her kid brother is athletics-mad.
Always talking about me!

520
00:39:28,875 --> 00:39:33,232
Monty, you'd better have my glass.
I've a terrible feeling you're going to need it.

521

- Sorry, Monty.

522
00:39:41,995 --> 00:39:44,270
Yes, thank you very much, sir.

523
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:46,346
Yes, of course I will, sir.

524
00:39:51,195 --> 00:39:53,231
Good evening, Miss Gordon!

525
00:39:53,315 --> 00:39:55,306
A triumph, I hear.

526
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:21,346
Who was that chap over there?

527
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:23,746
Music critic of the <i>Star.</i>

528
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:27,032
- Boring old buffer, really.
- Well, he obviously enjoyed it.

529
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:29,106
I shouldn't think so.

530
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:32,312
They always say that.
They save the poison for the print.

531
00:40:32,395 --> 00:40:36,104
- A bit off tonight, I thought.
- What? You were magnificent!

532
00:40:36,195 --> 00:40:38,186
Thank you.

533
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:42,553
One of my little maids has gone and
got herself preggers with a gondolier.

534
00:40:42,635 --> 00:40:45,752
We had to shove her second on tonight.
The trío...

535
00:40:45,835 --> 00:40:49,544
- Your usual, Miss Gordon?
- Thank you, Toffy.

536
00:40:49,635 --> 00:40:51,626
And you, sir.

537
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:53,474
Thank you.

538
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:57,309
This is Mr Abrahams.
He's a very famous runner.

539
00:40:57,395 --> 00:41:00,307
He's trying your special
for the first time tonight.

540
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:03,068
- I hope you enjoy it, sir.
- I'm sure I shall.

541
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:06,826
Well, go on then!

542
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:11,623
It's a secret concoction of Toffy's...

543
00:41:11,715 --> 00:41:13,706
...a sort of cocktail <i>de maison...</i>

544
00:41:13,795 --> 00:41:16,025
...so you'd jolly well better enjoy it.

545
00:41:16,755 --> 00:41:19,064
- Excellent.
- There, Toffy!

546
00:41:19,155 --> 00:41:21,544
You've won yourself a friend for life.

547
00:41:22,715 --> 00:41:24,706
My favourite, please.

548
00:41:26,555 --> 00:41:28,546
- For two.
- My pleasure.

549
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:33,386
What have I ordered?

550
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:35,227
Surprise.

551
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:37,306
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

552
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:47,304
Well... the great Harold Abrahams.

553
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:49,991
My brother will be insanely jealous.

554
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:52,066
So will mine.

555
00:41:55,715 --> 00:41:57,706
You don't look very ruthless.

556
00:41:57,795 --> 00:41:59,308
Should I?

557
00:41:59,395 --> 00:42:03,104
According to my brother.
Tim says that's why you always win.

558
00:42:03,835 --> 00:42:06,224
- Why running?
- Why singing?

559
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,226
It's my job.

560
00:42:10,595 --> 00:42:13,746
No, that's silly. I do it because I love it.

561
00:42:15,595 --> 00:42:17,665
Do you love running?

562
00:42:17,755 --> 00:42:21,509
I'm more of an addict.
It's a compulsión. A weapon.

563
00:42:21,595 --> 00:42:24,029
- Against what?
- Being Jewish, I suppose.

564
00:42:29,795 --> 00:42:31,672
You're not serious?!

565
00:42:31,755 --> 00:42:33,154
You're not Jewish...

566
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:35,226
...or you wouldn't ask.

567
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:36,543
Fiddlesticks!

568
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:38,626
People don't care.

569
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:44,594
Anyway, being Jewish
hasn't done you any harm.

570
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:47,386
I'm what I call semi-deprived.

571
00:42:47,475 --> 00:42:49,670
That sounds clever. What does it mean?

572
00:42:49,755 --> 00:42:53,350
It means they lead me to water,
but they won't let me drink.

573
00:42:55,235 --> 00:42:58,864
You're a funny old stick,
Mr Harold Abrahams.

574
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,906
Funny...

575
00:43:01,995 --> 00:43:03,951
...but fascinating.

576
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:06,105
I'll settle for the fascinating.

577
00:43:06,195 --> 00:43:08,550
Life isn't that gloomy, is it?

578
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,866
Not tonight.

579
00:43:16,155 --> 00:43:18,385
You're so beautiful.

580
00:43:20,155 --> 00:43:21,907
Like you.

581
00:43:21,995 --> 00:43:24,555
<i>Le pied de porc anglais, madame.</i>

582
00:43:26,755 --> 00:43:28,666
Pigs' trotters.

583
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:30,586
Oh, my God.

584
00:43:42,355 --> 00:43:45,472
<i> The train arriving at platform two...</i>

585
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:47,864
<i>... is the Flying Scotsman from Aberdeen.</i>

586
00:43:47,955 --> 00:43:50,628
7.30, Mr Liddell! 7.30 on t'dot.

587
00:43:52,475 --> 00:43:54,670
There you are, sir. Hot tea and toast.

588
00:43:54,755 --> 00:43:56,074
Great.

589
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:58,225
- You sleep all right?
- Like a log.

590
00:43:58,315 --> 00:44:00,749
Aye. Must have a clear conscience.

591
00:44:00,835 --> 00:44:02,826
Far from it.

592
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:06,066
- Are we here?
- Aye, sir. Just pulled in. King's Cross.

593
00:44:06,155 --> 00:44:09,033
Oh, and here's the paper, with your picture in.

594
00:44:09,115 --> 00:44:11,424
Expecting great things, from all accounts.

595
00:44:11,515 --> 00:44:13,506
Are they indeed?

596
00:44:14,155 --> 00:44:16,749
- Here you are.
- Much obliged, sir.

597
00:44:16,835 --> 00:44:19,872
Now, no hurry. You've got
an hour before we kick you out.

598
00:44:19,955 --> 00:44:22,344
- And good luck for this afternoon.
- Thank you.

599
00:44:22,435 --> 00:44:24,551
Come on, sir. Wake up. King's Cross.

600
00:44:26,715 --> 00:44:29,866
Aye, Mr Abrahams. So's the Scot.

601
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:27,146
Mr Abrahams?

602
00:45:28,115 --> 00:45:30,106
Mr Liddell.

603
00:45:31,435 --> 00:45:33,744
I'd like to wish you the best of success.

604
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:36,872
Thank you. And may the best man win.

605
00:45:44,555 --> 00:45:46,546
Get to your marks.

606
00:45:58,075 --> 00:46:00,066
Get set.

607
00:46:12,635 --> 00:46:14,626
Extraordinary.

608
00:47:03,755 --> 00:47:05,746
Harold.

609
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:08,506
Harold.

610
00:47:10,555 --> 00:47:12,546
This is absolutely ridiculous.

611
00:47:12,635 --> 00:47:15,832
It's a race you've lost, not a relative.
Nobody's dead.

612
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:21,314
For goodness' sake, snap out of it, Harold.
You're behaving like a child.

613
00:47:21,395 --> 00:47:23,465
- I lost.
- I know!

614
00:47:24,035 --> 00:47:26,026
I was there, remember? Watching.

615
00:47:29,075 --> 00:47:31,066
It was marvellous.

616
00:47:31,675 --> 00:47:33,666
You were marvellous.

617
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,985
He was more marvellous, that's all.

618
00:47:37,075 --> 00:47:39,066
On the day, the best man won.

619
00:47:39,155 --> 00:47:41,146
I had to look for him.

620
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:43,954
It's absolutely fundamental. You never look.

621
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:49,468
He was ahead. There was nothing you
could have done. He won fair and square.

622
00:47:49,555 --> 00:47:51,352
Well, that's that, Abrahams.

623
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:53,903
If you can't take a beating, it's for the best.

624
00:47:53,995 --> 00:47:55,986
I don't run to take beatings!

625
00:47:57,755 --> 00:47:59,313
I run to win.

626
00:47:59,395 --> 00:48:01,386
If I can't win, I won't run.

627
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:04,906
If you don't run, you can't win.

628
00:48:06,155 --> 00:48:08,305
Ring me when you've sorted that one out.

629
00:48:08,395 --> 00:48:10,386
Sybil...

630
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,344
Don't go.

631
00:48:15,915 --> 00:48:17,906
I just don't know what to do.

632
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,986
Try growing up.

633
00:48:40,155 --> 00:48:42,146
Harold.

634
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:44,746
You're a great man.

635
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:46,826
You ran like a god.

636
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,633
I was proud of you. Don't make me ashamed.

637
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:53,706
It's not the losing, Syb.

638
00:48:54,795 --> 00:48:57,389
Eric Liddell's a fine man and a fine runner.

639
00:48:57,475 --> 00:48:59,466
It's me!

640
00:48:59,555 --> 00:49:01,546
After all that work...

641
00:49:02,395 --> 00:49:04,625
...now, God knows, what do I aim for?

642
00:49:06,395 --> 00:49:08,545
Beating him the next time.

643
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,549
Sybil, I can't run any faster.

644
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:18,066
Mr Abrahams!

645
00:49:18,835 --> 00:49:20,427
Mr Abrahams!

646
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:24,146
I can find you another two yards.

647
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:36,587
Charlie Paddock.

648
00:49:36,675 --> 00:49:39,792
Californian cannonball.
Worid's fastest human.

649
00:49:39,875 --> 00:49:42,025
Winner, 100 metres, Olympic Games...

650
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,424
...1920, Antwerp. Time?
- 10.3.

651
00:49:48,475 --> 00:49:50,466
Jackson Scholz...

652
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,546
...the New York Thunderbolt.

653
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:55,311
Runner-up, Olympic Games, 1920.

654
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:57,386
Lost by looking right.

655
00:49:57,475 --> 00:49:59,545
Look, here's the finish. You see?

656
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:01,591
Paddock, leaping past him at the tape?

657
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:03,745
That glance cost Scholz the race.

658
00:50:05,075 --> 00:50:07,066
- Scholz's fastest?
- 10.3... 4.

659
00:50:11,635 --> 00:50:14,991
Eric Liddell. Well, you know all about him.

660
00:50:15,075 --> 00:50:17,111
Look at them.

661
00:50:17,195 --> 00:50:19,425
Think them. Breathe them.

662
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:23,428
I want their faces leering at you
every time you shut your eyes.

663
00:50:23,515 --> 00:50:26,109
The Flying Scotsman first.
That bloody well hurt.

664
00:50:26,195 --> 00:50:28,151
What, Eric Liddell?

665
00:50:28,235 --> 00:50:30,226
Well, he's no real problem.

666
00:50:31,075 --> 00:50:34,545
He's a great runner
but he needs to go further out.

667
00:50:34,635 --> 00:50:37,308
- He's no 100-metres man.
- He could have fooled me!

668
00:50:37,395 --> 00:50:39,147
Yeah, he's fast.

669
00:50:39,235 --> 00:50:42,750
But he won't go any faster, not in
the dash, anyway. He's a gut runner.

670
00:50:42,835 --> 00:50:44,826
He's all heart. Digs deep.

671
00:50:45,555 --> 00:50:47,546
A short sprint is run on nerves.

672
00:50:47,635 --> 00:50:50,752
- It's tailor-made for neurotics.
- Thanks very much.

673
00:50:50,835 --> 00:50:54,669
No, I mean it. You can push guts,
bully them, but you can hone nerves.

674
00:50:54,755 --> 00:50:57,906
Paddock, Scholz and Eric Liddell.

675
00:50:58,755 --> 00:51:00,746
Come here a minute, Mr Abrahams.

676
00:51:06,635 --> 00:51:09,229
Now, do you know
why you lost the other day?

677
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:11,306
Because you're overstriding.

678
00:51:11,395 --> 00:51:13,351
Just a couple of inches. Now...

679
00:51:13,435 --> 00:51:17,144
These coins represent the strides
in your hundred metres.

680
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:23,547
Have you got another two coins,
Mr Abrahams?

681
00:51:25,795 --> 00:51:27,831
Well, maybe we can find them.

682
00:51:27,915 --> 00:51:29,906
As I said...

683
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:31,792
...overstriding.

684
00:51:31,875 --> 00:51:33,786
Death to the sprinter.

685
00:51:34,555 --> 00:51:36,625
Slap in the face each stride you take.

686
00:51:36,715 --> 00:51:38,706
Knocks you back.

687
00:51:39,435 --> 00:51:42,029
Like that. Like that...

688
00:51:42,115 --> 00:51:44,106
...and that!

689
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:46,469
Now...

690
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:00,349
I want you to imagine
you're running on hot bricks.

691
00:52:00,435 --> 00:52:03,791
If you leave your feet too long
on the ground, they'll get burnt.

692
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:06,992
Up, up, up. Light, light, light!
Light as a feather.

693
00:52:30,235 --> 00:52:32,066
Set!

694
00:52:57,555 --> 00:53:00,308
No! Not your head back again!

695
00:53:00,395 --> 00:53:02,147
Get it level! Go and do it again.

696
00:53:02,235 --> 00:53:03,350
That's it!

697
00:53:10,715 --> 00:53:12,671
Faster, come on!

698
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:15,030
Pass the car! Go on!

699
00:53:15,115 --> 00:53:16,514
Go on! Go on!

700
00:53:16,595 --> 00:53:18,745
Go on, go on, on, on!

701
00:53:19,595 --> 00:53:21,665
Come on, now! Keep it up, come on!

702
00:53:23,555 --> 00:53:25,989
Rhythm, Mr Abrahams, rhythm!

703
00:53:49,995 --> 00:53:53,704
<i>Training, training. All I ever hear is training.</i>

704
00:53:53,795 --> 00:53:56,514
<i>Do you believe in</i>
<i>what we're doing here or not?</i>

705
00:53:56,595 --> 00:53:58,586
Look, Jennie, I'm sorry.

706
00:54:00,235 --> 00:54:02,226
I was late. I apologise.

707
00:54:02,315 --> 00:54:05,307
- It's all very well, Eric.
- Look, I said I was sorry.

708
00:54:05,395 --> 00:54:08,228
To me. It's not me you've insulted.

709
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:10,306
Away with your bother!

710
00:54:10,395 --> 00:54:13,068
The Lord'll not feel slighted
at the missing of a bus.

711
00:54:13,155 --> 00:54:15,385
Yes, Eric, you missed a bus. But why?

712
00:54:15,475 --> 00:54:17,466
Your mind's not with us any more, son.

713
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:20,308
It's full of running and starting
and medals and pace.

714
00:54:20,395 --> 00:54:23,148
It's so full of it,
you've no room for standing still.

715
00:54:23,235 --> 00:54:25,624
Jennie, Jennie, Jennie!

716
00:54:25,715 --> 00:54:27,706
Don't fret yourself.

717
00:54:28,235 --> 00:54:30,226
I do fret myself, Eric.

718
00:54:30,835 --> 00:54:32,826
I'm frightened for you.

719
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:35,475
I'm frightened for what it all might do to you.

720
00:54:45,875 --> 00:54:50,346
Please, Mr Liddell.
Would you sign your name, please?

721
00:54:50,435 --> 00:54:52,232
Surely.

722
00:54:54,435 --> 00:54:56,426
You want to pick yourself a pen?

723
00:55:03,755 --> 00:55:05,746
- There you are.
- Thanks.

724
00:55:19,195 --> 00:55:22,551
Come on, Jennie, let's go for a walk.
I've got something to say.

725
00:55:36,155 --> 00:55:38,623
It's a sight and a half, in't it, Jennie?

726
00:55:49,435 --> 00:55:51,665
Auld Reekie. I'll be sad to leave it.

727
00:56:05,035 --> 00:56:06,753
I've decided.

728
00:56:07,395 --> 00:56:09,386
I'm going back to China.

729
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:11,989
The missionary service have accepted me.

730
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:15,150
Oh, I'm so pleased!

731
00:56:15,235 --> 00:56:17,669
But I've got a lot of running to do first.

732
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:20,746
Jennie...

733
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:23,065
Jennie, you've got to understand.

734
00:56:26,075 --> 00:56:28,509
I believe that God made me for a purpose.

735
00:56:29,395 --> 00:56:31,465
For China.

736
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,546
But he also made me fast.

737
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:37,872
And when I run... I feel his pleasure.

738
00:56:39,475 --> 00:56:42,228
To give it up would be
to hold him in contempt.

739
00:56:43,235 --> 00:56:45,226
You were right.

740
00:56:45,755 --> 00:56:47,746
It's notjust fun.

741
00:56:48,395 --> 00:56:51,307
To win is to honour him.

742
00:56:53,595 --> 00:56:55,586
Jennie...

743
00:56:56,395 --> 00:56:58,386
Jennie.

744
00:56:58,755 --> 00:57:00,746
I've got my degree to get.

745
00:57:01,475 --> 00:57:03,466
All that work.

746
00:57:04,315 --> 00:57:06,306
Then there's Paris.

747
00:57:07,235 --> 00:57:09,226
The Olympic Games.

748
00:57:11,635 --> 00:57:13,626
There's just not enough of me.

749
00:57:15,155 --> 00:57:18,067
I'm asking you to manage
the missión on your own...

750
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:20,146
...till then.

751
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:23,146
Will you do that for me, Jennie?

752
00:57:40,395 --> 00:57:42,386
Andy, I've lost him.

753
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,147
Can't reach him.

754
00:57:44,235 --> 00:57:46,669
You will, old girl. You will.

755
00:57:46,755 --> 00:57:49,474
He says he needs to clear his mind of me.

756
00:57:51,155 --> 00:57:53,225
He can't love me and say that.

757
00:57:59,275 --> 00:58:01,550
Syb.

758
00:58:01,635 --> 00:58:04,069
The worid's against him, or so he believes.

759
00:58:04,155 --> 00:58:06,510
Now he's got a chance to prove himself.

760
00:58:06,595 --> 00:58:09,746
He can't see or hear anything
beyond that, not even you.

761
00:58:09,835 --> 00:58:13,510
It's hard, I know,
but you've just got to try and understand.

762
00:58:13,595 --> 00:58:16,587
- Why should I?
- Because he's what you want, isn't he?

763
00:58:18,755 --> 00:58:20,507
What about you?

764
00:58:20,595 --> 00:58:22,551
And Stallard and Aubrey?

765
00:58:22,635 --> 00:58:25,433
You're still the same.
The chance is there for you too.

766
00:58:25,515 --> 00:58:27,665
To be <i>a</i> fastest, yes, but not <i>the</i> fastest.

767
00:58:27,755 --> 00:58:29,950
The fastest man ever before.

768
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:34,794
Father's never going to learn how to do that.

769
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:36,831
That's immortality.

770
00:58:36,915 --> 00:58:39,668
Just think what it means to a man like Harold.

771
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:43,232
Well, to me the whole thing's fun.
I don't need that.

772
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:45,306
"Cast care aside" and all that.

773
00:58:46,475 --> 00:58:50,673
But for Harold, it's a matter of life and death.

774
00:58:50,755 --> 00:58:52,905
- So all I can do is wait?
- 'Fraid so.

775
00:58:52,995 --> 00:58:55,065
And pray like hell that he wins!

776
00:58:56,475 --> 00:58:58,466
And if he doesn't?

777
00:59:01,155 --> 00:59:03,146
You mustn't worry, old thing.

778
00:59:03,235 --> 00:59:06,147
I've never ever seen a man
so smitten as our Harold.

779
00:59:06,235 --> 00:59:09,227
It's just that I'm a little envious, that's all.

780
00:59:09,835 --> 00:59:11,826
Oh, Andy.

781
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:18,546
- Your parasol, Miss Gordon.
- Thank you, Mildred.

782
00:59:19,075 --> 00:59:21,066
Good luck tonight.

783
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:23,146
He's a damned fool!

784
00:59:23,235 --> 00:59:25,908
I always thought the Irish had all the luck!

785
00:59:26,795 --> 00:59:28,990
- John, Savoy Theatre.
- Yes, sir.

786
00:59:29,075 --> 00:59:31,066
Splendid.

787
00:59:39,755 --> 00:59:41,825
Mildred, would you get my spikes?

788
00:59:45,755 --> 00:59:47,746
Ready, my lord!

789
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:52,549
Now, Coote, if I shed a drop I want to know.

790
00:59:52,635 --> 00:59:54,626
Touch but not spill, what?

791
01:00:08,475 --> 01:00:10,545
<i> Life slips by, Abrahams.</i>

792
01:00:10,635 --> 01:00:12,865
<i>Life slips by.</i>

793
01:00:12,955 --> 01:00:17,233
But this fine old university of ours,
she offers some rare consolations.

794
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:19,306
Beyond measure, sir.

795
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:22,831
I can take it, then, that you would
be acutely grieved to discover...

796
01:00:22,915 --> 01:00:26,510
...that any behaviour or action
on your part were causing her grief?

797
01:00:26,595 --> 01:00:29,155
Naturally, sir. I would, deeply.

798
01:00:29,235 --> 01:00:31,226
Good. I was sure of it.

799
01:00:32,235 --> 01:00:36,467
Here in Cambridge, we've always
been proud of our athletic prowess.

800
01:00:36,555 --> 01:00:40,468
We believe, we've always believed,
that our games are indispensable...

801
01:00:40,555 --> 01:00:43,752
...in helping to complete
the education of an Englishman.

802
01:00:43,835 --> 01:00:45,826
They create character.

803
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:49,547
They foster courage, honesty and leadership.

804
01:00:49,635 --> 01:00:53,105
But most of all,
an unassailable spirit of loyalty...

805
01:00:53,195 --> 01:00:56,153
...comradeship and mutual responsibility.

806
01:00:56,635 --> 01:01:00,230
- Would you agree?
- Yes, sir. I would.

807
01:01:04,155 --> 01:01:08,467
I'm afraid there is a growing suspición
in the bosom of this university -

808
01:01:08,555 --> 01:01:10,705
and I tell you this without in any way...

809
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:13,946
...decrying your achievements,
in which we all rejoice -

810
01:01:14,035 --> 01:01:17,471
that in your enthusiasm for success...

811
01:01:17,555 --> 01:01:20,547
...you have perhaps lost sight
of some of these ideals.

812
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:25,151
May I ask what form
this disloyalty, this betrayal, takes?

813
01:01:25,235 --> 01:01:28,352
- Oh, hardly betrayal!
- The word grief was mentioned.

814
01:01:29,195 --> 01:01:31,629
It's said that you use a personal coach.

815
01:01:32,755 --> 01:01:34,746
Mr Mussabini, yes.

816
01:01:34,835 --> 01:01:38,714
- Is he Italian?
- Of Italian extraction, yes.

817
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:41,673
- I see.
- But not all Italian.

818
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:44,553
- I'm relieved to hear it.
- He's half Arab!

819
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:53,186
Do we take it that you employ this
Mr Mussabini on a professional basis?

820
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:57,632
Sam Mussabini is the finest,
most advanced...

821
01:01:57,715 --> 01:02:00,912
...clearest-thinking athletics coach
in the country.

822
01:02:00,995 --> 01:02:03,304
I'm honoured to be worthy of his attention.

823
01:02:03,395 --> 01:02:05,386
Nevertheless, he's a professional.

824
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:07,511
What else would he be? He's the best.

825
01:02:07,595 --> 01:02:11,349
Ah, but there, Mr Abrahams,
I'm afraid our paths diverge.

826
01:02:11,955 --> 01:02:15,743
You see, this university believes
that the way of the amateur...

827
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:19,066
...is the only one to provide
satisfactory results.

828
01:02:19,155 --> 01:02:21,146
I am an amateur.

829
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:23,305
You're being trained by a professional.

830
01:02:23,395 --> 01:02:25,670
You've adopted a professional attitude.

831
01:02:25,755 --> 01:02:30,226
For the past year, you have concentrated
on developing your own technique...

832
01:02:30,315 --> 01:02:34,228
...in the headlong pursuit,
may I suggest, of individual glory.

833
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:38,388
Not a policy very conducive to
the fostering of <i>esprit de corps.</i>

834
01:02:38,955 --> 01:02:41,913
I am a Cambridge man first and last.

835
01:02:42,835 --> 01:02:45,144
I am an Englishman first and last.

836
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:50,313
What I have achieved, what I intend
to achieve, is for my family...

837
01:02:50,395 --> 01:02:53,592
...my university and my country.

838
01:02:54,435 --> 01:02:57,586
And I bitterly resent
your suggesting otherwise.

839
01:02:57,675 --> 01:03:00,712
Your aim is to win at all costs, is it not?

840
01:03:00,795 --> 01:03:04,344
At all costs, no.
But I do aim to win within the rules.

841
01:03:04,435 --> 01:03:07,188
Perhaps you would rather
I played the gentleman and lost?

842
01:03:07,275 --> 01:03:09,743
To playing the tradesman, yes.

843
01:03:13,555 --> 01:03:18,106
My dear boy, your approach has been,
if I may say so, a little too plebeian.

844
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:20,911
You are the elite...

845
01:03:20,995 --> 01:03:23,748
...and are therefore expected
to behave as such.

846
01:03:32,675 --> 01:03:34,666
Thank you, sir...

847
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:37,386
...for your hospitality.

848
01:03:38,475 --> 01:03:40,989
The evening has been most illuminating.

849
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:44,266
Good night to you, sir.

850
01:03:46,315 --> 01:03:48,704
You know, gentlemen...

851
01:03:49,715 --> 01:03:51,831
...you yearn for victory, just as I do.

852
01:03:52,635 --> 01:03:55,832
But achieved with
the apparent effortlessness of gods.

853
01:03:56,675 --> 01:04:00,384
Yours are the archaic values
of the prep school playground.

854
01:04:01,595 --> 01:04:03,745
You deceive no one but yourselves.

855
01:04:04,635 --> 01:04:07,229
I believe in the pursuit of excellence...

856
01:04:08,435 --> 01:04:10,665
...and I'll carry the future with <i>me.</i>

857
01:04:20,755 --> 01:04:22,985
Well, there goes your Semite, Hugh.

858
01:04:24,395 --> 01:04:26,386
A different god.

859
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:29,065
A different mountain top.

860
01:04:41,395 --> 01:04:43,909
Harold! Harold! We're in.

861
01:04:43,995 --> 01:04:48,068
All of us!
You, Henry, Andy and me, we're all in!

862
01:04:48,155 --> 01:04:50,544
You 100 and 200, Andy 400 and hurdles...

863
01:04:50,635 --> 01:04:53,229
...Henry the mile, and me the steeplechase.

864
01:04:53,315 --> 01:04:55,306
Paris, here we come!

865
01:04:56,435 --> 01:04:58,426
Eric Liddell's picked too.

866
01:04:58,515 --> 01:05:00,426
Rivals under the same flag.

867
01:05:00,515 --> 01:05:02,506
Your chance to get even, eh?

868
01:05:02,595 --> 01:05:04,665
I can't wait.

869
01:05:04,915 --> 01:05:07,145
Welcome to Dover, my Lord Birkenhead.

870
01:05:07,755 --> 01:05:10,428
Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...

871
01:05:10,515 --> 01:05:12,745
...that they'll wipe the floor with our boys?

872
01:05:12,835 --> 01:05:16,384
It's certainly true that
the Americans have prepared seriously...

873
01:05:16,475 --> 01:05:18,909
...some would say too seriously,
to gain success.

874
01:05:18,995 --> 01:05:23,466
But we feel we may, in our
unsophisticated way, have their match.

875
01:05:23,555 --> 01:05:26,149
Sir, do you think
the British team stand a chance...

876
01:05:26,235 --> 01:05:30,786
...against such great American athletes
as Charlie Paddock and Jackson Scholz?

877
01:05:30,875 --> 01:05:34,504
You Americans have a number of men
who are rated as worid-beaters...

878
01:05:34,595 --> 01:05:39,032
...but this contest is in Europe,
not in the rarefied climes of the United States.

879
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:41,834
Parisian conditions are bound
to be more robust...

880
01:05:41,915 --> 01:05:44,907
...more combative and certainly more cavalier.

881
01:05:44,995 --> 01:05:47,907
Lord Birkenhead,
are the Yanks so well trained...

882
01:05:47,995 --> 01:05:50,634
...that they will wipe the floor with our boys?

883
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:53,149
Gentlemen, Abrahams, Liddell and Lindsay...

884
01:05:53,235 --> 01:05:56,193
We have the men who could
give them a run for their money.

885
01:06:00,355 --> 01:06:02,152
Eric!

886
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:07,307
Sandy! You haven't come all the way
from Scotland just to see me off, have you?

887
01:06:07,395 --> 01:06:09,351
I have not. I'm seeing myself off.

888
01:06:09,435 --> 01:06:11,391
Come on, or we'll miss the boat.

889
01:06:11,475 --> 01:06:15,150
Hey, Mr Liddell! What do you think
of your chances against Abrahams?

890
01:06:15,235 --> 01:06:17,226
I'll do my best. Can do no less.

891
01:06:17,315 --> 01:06:19,306
Mr Liddell, sir!

892
01:06:19,395 --> 01:06:21,829
What about the qualifying heats on Sunday?

893
01:06:21,915 --> 01:06:24,270
- What did you say?
- On Sunday!

894
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,710
Do you think you can beat the Americans?

895
01:06:27,915 --> 01:06:29,985
There's Mr Abrahams! There he is!

896
01:06:30,075 --> 01:06:32,066
- Mr Abrahams!
- Sorry, I've no time...

897
01:06:32,155 --> 01:06:33,474
Hello, Jeremy.

898
01:06:33,555 --> 01:06:36,149
- Gilbert and Sullivan will win.
- Thanks very much.

899
01:06:36,235 --> 01:06:38,669
- Harold!
- Sybil.

900
01:06:44,715 --> 01:06:46,865
- I came to wish you luck.
- I'm glad.

901
01:06:51,515 --> 01:06:54,552
I understand. I wanted you to know that.

902
01:06:56,995 --> 01:06:58,986
I'll be here when you come back.

903
01:07:04,835 --> 01:07:08,714
Hurry along, Mr Abrahams.
She's about to sail!

904
01:07:09,315 --> 01:07:12,671
I must go. I'll see you in three weeks.

905
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:17,666
Bye-bye.

906
01:07:20,275 --> 01:07:23,711
Mind your step, sir.
We want you to get there in one piece.

907
01:08:05,475 --> 01:08:09,468
- When did you get to know?
- Did you not read the papers this morning?

908
01:08:09,555 --> 01:08:13,150
The heats for the 100 are on
the Sunday after the opening ceremony...

909
01:08:13,235 --> 01:08:15,669
...the semis and final a couple of days after.

910
01:08:16,235 --> 01:08:18,226
It's only a heat.

911
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,465
Does it make all that difference?

912
01:08:25,755 --> 01:08:27,746
Yeah.

913
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:29,826
Yeah, it does.

914
01:08:34,475 --> 01:08:37,865
And strong though the temptation may be...

915
01:08:37,955 --> 01:08:42,346
...to disport your newly acquired finery
around the streets of Paris -

916
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:45,265
if they aren't temptation enough -

917
01:08:45,355 --> 01:08:48,153
may I ask you on behalf
of the Olympic Committee...

918
01:08:48,235 --> 01:08:50,988
...to save your sartorial splendour...

919
01:08:51,075 --> 01:08:53,384
...until at least after the opening ceremony.

920
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:55,033
May I remind you...

921
01:08:55,115 --> 01:08:57,106
...you are the favoured few.

922
01:08:58,075 --> 01:09:00,384
You constitute what is without doubt...

923
01:09:00,475 --> 01:09:04,184
...the most powerful athletic force
ever to leave these shores.

924
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:07,026
You are to face the worid's best -

925
01:09:07,275 --> 01:09:09,743
brown and yellow, white and black...

926
01:09:09,835 --> 01:09:11,826
...young and ardent as yourselves...

927
01:09:11,915 --> 01:09:14,190
...fleet of foot and strong of limb...

928
01:09:14,835 --> 01:09:19,226
...from every civilised nation
on the face of the earth.

929
01:09:19,315 --> 01:09:21,385
I have no doubt...

930
01:09:21,475 --> 01:09:25,468
...that you will acquit yourselves
honourably and... with distinction.

931
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,941
Good luck to you all.

932
01:09:47,030 --> 01:09:49,339
<i> Your mind's not with us any more.</i>

933
01:09:49,430 --> 01:09:52,263
<i>It's full of sprinting and starting</i>
<i>and medals and pace.</i>

934
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:55,069
<i>It's so full of it,</i>
<i>you've no room for standing still!</i>

935
01:09:55,150 --> 01:09:57,948
<i> Jennie, Jennie! Don't fret yourself.</i>

936
01:09:58,030 --> 01:10:01,739
<i>I do fret myself, Eric. I'm frightened for you.</i>

937
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:04,424
<i>I'm frightened what it all might do to you.</i>

938
01:10:07,350 --> 01:10:10,262
<i>- Do you know what day it is?</i>
<i>- Yeah. Sunday.</i>

939
01:10:10,350 --> 01:10:13,581
<i> The Sabbath's not a day</i>
<i>for playing football, is it?</i>

940
01:10:16,950 --> 01:10:19,942
<i>It's an awful step you're taking, Liddell.</i>

941
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:22,225
<i>The whole of Britain will be watching you.</i>

942
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:24,699
I don't know that they'll understand.

943
01:10:27,350 --> 01:10:29,341
I'm not sure that <i>I</i> understand.

944
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:34,465
I'm not sure that I do either, sir.

945
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:38,338
For the last three years
I've devoted myself to my running...

946
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,421
...just to be on this ship.

947
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:42,501
I gave up my rugby.

948
01:10:42,590 --> 01:10:44,581
My work has suffered.

949
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:47,983
And I've deeply hurt someone
I hold very dear.

950
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:51,221
Because I told myself...

951
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:53,949
...if I win, I win for God.

952
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:58,465
And now I find myself sitting here,
destroying it all.

953
01:11:00,150 --> 01:11:02,061
But I have to.

954
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:04,186
To run would be against God's law.

955
01:11:06,790 --> 01:11:08,781
I was mistaken.

956
01:11:11,310 --> 01:11:15,383
My boy - as things stand, you must not run.

957
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,587
But I want you
to hold your fire for a while, Liddell.

958
01:11:18,670 --> 01:11:20,661
Leave everything to me.

959
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:25,268
Say nothing. Wait until we get to Paris.

960
01:11:25,910 --> 01:11:27,901
I'll have a word with the French.

961
01:11:27,990 --> 01:11:30,060
I'm not without a certain pull...

962
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,186
...and we fought in the war together.

963
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:34,261
They do owe us something.

964
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:36,341
I don't understand.

965
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:39,263
They're not a very principled lot, the Frogs.

966
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:42,663
But, when faced with a stand like yours...

967
01:11:42,750 --> 01:11:44,741
...one never knows.

968
01:11:44,830 --> 01:11:46,821
I might get through.

969
01:11:50,430 --> 01:11:52,739
I just might possibly persuade them.

970
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,701
The French, sir?

971
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,781
What can they do?

972
01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:01,509
Shift that bloody heat of yours, of course.

973
01:12:01,590 --> 01:12:03,581
Good evening.

974
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:11,741
Good night, sir.

975
01:12:23,110 --> 01:12:24,702
# With cat-like tread

976
01:12:24,790 --> 01:12:26,587
# Upon our prey we steal

977
01:12:26,670 --> 01:12:28,388
# In silence dread

978
01:12:28,470 --> 01:12:30,426
# Our cautious way we feel

979
01:12:30,510 --> 01:12:32,387
# No sound at all

980
01:12:32,470 --> 01:12:34,222
# We never speak a word

981
01:12:34,310 --> 01:12:37,859
# A fly's footfall would be distinctly heard

982
01:12:38,110 --> 01:12:41,785
# Come friends, who plough the sea

983
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:43,622
# Truce to navigation

984
01:12:43,710 --> 01:12:45,507
# Take another station

985
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:49,424
# Let's vary piracy

986
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:52,502
# With a little burglary

987
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:59,101
<i> I wish you could see, Ma, the</i>
<i>wonderful spirit abroad now we've left home.</i>

988
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:02,148
<i>Harold on the piano</i>
<i>with his beloved Gilbert and Sullivan.</i>

989
01:13:02,230 --> 01:13:05,905
<i>We're all laughing and relaxing,</i>
<i>chatting about anything but running.</i>

990
01:13:06,110 --> 01:13:08,578
<i>We're here for Britain and we know it.</i>

991
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:10,501
<i>I'm here for you, Ma.</i>

992
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,502
<i>You and Pa. I hope I do you proud.</i>

993
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,581
<i>There's not a chap amongst us...</i>

994
01:13:15,670 --> 01:13:18,787
<i>... who isn't ready to burst his heart</i>

995
01:13:19,510 --> 01:13:21,501
<i> Attention!</i>

996
01:14:17,470 --> 01:14:20,940
"American champions arrive in France."

997
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:32,382
There's Paddock.

998
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:34,461
Charles Paddock.

999
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,825
- There's Fitch.
- My God!

1000
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:41,541
And there's Scholz.

1001
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,383
Yes, that's Scholz all right.

1002
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:46,904
A bit more my size. Mean with it, though.

1003
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,582
10.4.

1004
01:14:48,670 --> 01:14:50,820
Got your plate full there, Harold.

1005
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:53,621
Battle on your hands, what!

1006
01:15:00,070 --> 01:15:02,026
Charles H Paddock...

1007
01:15:02,110 --> 01:15:04,260
...and Jackson Scholz.

1008
01:15:04,350 --> 01:15:06,784
The fastest men in the worid.

1009
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:20,507
Push it!

1010
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,581
Come on, that's more like it!

1011
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:31,265
One, two! One, two! One, two!

1012
01:15:38,150 --> 01:15:40,141
Come on now!

1013
01:15:45,710 --> 01:15:49,942
Keep doin' it like that, come on!

1014
01:15:50,990 --> 01:15:52,981

Your Royal Highness, may I introduce
Mr Tom Watson, representing New Zealand.

How do you do? You've come a long way.

1033
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:14,181
I'm from Oxford, sir. They wrote to me.

1034
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:17,023
Said as I was over here,
I might as well take part.

1035
01:21:17,110 --> 01:21:20,022
- Economical. But can you run?
- I'll give it a try, sir.

1036
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:23,625
- That's the spirit. Best of luck to you.
- Thank you, sir.

1037
01:21:38,110 --> 01:21:40,180
The royal benediction, no less.

1038
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:44,502
- The chap's invaluable.
- Hear, hear! Henry V and all that.

1039
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:46,581
Protocol, Monty. Protocol.

1040
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:51,300
He's here to show us what may be done -
and more essentially, what may not be.

1041
01:21:52,110 --> 01:21:54,419
Jackson Scholz. How do you do?

1042
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:56,501
I'm Eric Liddell.

1043
01:21:56,590 --> 01:21:58,660
Well, we've heard a lot about you.

1044
01:22:02,990 --> 01:22:04,264
Ah, Liddell!

1045
01:22:04,350 --> 01:22:06,341
Excuse me.

1046
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,941
I was afraid you weren't here.

1047
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:11,021
I'm afraid I am, sir.

1048
01:22:11,510 --> 01:22:13,660
Fine. Do you good.

1049
01:22:13,750 --> 01:22:15,741
Take you out of yourself a bit.

1050
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:18,864
The Prince of Wales would like to meet you.

1051
01:22:19,670 --> 01:22:21,422
No.

1052
01:22:21,510 --> 01:22:23,501
No. No, sir.

1053
01:22:23,590 --> 01:22:25,023
It wouldn't be right.

1054
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:28,500
Liddell... he is your future king.

1055
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:30,740
Are you refusing to shake his hand?

1056
01:22:30,830 --> 01:22:33,503
Does your arrogance extend that far?

1057
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:39,269
My arrogance, sir, extends
just as far as my conscience demands.

1058
01:22:39,350 --> 01:22:41,181
Fine.

1059
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:45,548
Then let's hope that's wise enough
to give you room for manoeuvre.

1060
01:22:49,950 --> 01:22:51,941
All right, sir.

1061
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:54,100
Splendid. I'll take you to him now.

1062
01:23:08,910 --> 01:23:13,188
Your Royal Highness,
may I present Mr Eric Liddell?

1063
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,261
Delighted, Liddell. Delighted.

1064
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:18,103
I saw you play for Scotland.
It depressed me no end.

1065
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,420
Ran in a couple of tries from your own half.

1066
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:22,341
I believe I did, sir, yes.

1067
01:23:22,430 --> 01:23:24,864
Nice to have you on the same side at last.

1068
01:23:25,590 --> 01:23:28,104
Excellent effort of Lindsay's, don't you think?

1069
01:23:28,190 --> 01:23:31,341
- He did well, sir. He did indeed.
- An example to us all.

1070
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:35,787
Eric, may I introduce
His Grace the Duke of Sutherland...

1071
01:23:35,870 --> 01:23:38,020
...president of our Olympic Association?

1072
01:23:38,110 --> 01:23:41,102
- How do you do?
- And our chairman, Lord Cadogan.

1073
01:23:42,430 --> 01:23:44,421
Have a seat.

1074
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,221
Make yourself comfortable.

1075
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:49,501
Cigar?

1076
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:52,263
Oh, no, of course. You don't. Nor drink.

1077
01:23:52,350 --> 01:23:56,821
Such is the resolution of the young man
you have before you, gentlemen.

1078
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:05,948
Lord Birkenhead has advised us
as to your attitude...

1079
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:09,659
...towards your participation
in the 100-metres heats, Liddell.

1080
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:12,423
Or would your non-participation
be more accurate?

1081
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:14,501
It would, sir, yes.

1082
01:24:14,590 --> 01:24:17,741
We were also consulted as to
how we should approach the French.

1083
01:24:17,830 --> 01:24:22,187
Something we can't allow, going
cap in hand to the Frogs, of all people!

1084
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:24,261
Simply out of the question.

1085
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:28,468
A simple matter of national dignity.
Being a patriot, I'm sure you understand.

1086
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:31,508
I must say, sir,
I felt it was an impractical suggestion.

1087
01:24:31,590 --> 01:24:33,865
Why didn't you damn well say so?

1088
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:36,145
As an athlete, you value economy of effort.

1089
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:39,745
I wanted to run.
I was desperate enough to try anything.

1090
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,219
Well, all that being understood...

1091
01:24:42,310 --> 01:24:44,904
...we decided to invite you in for a little chat...

1092
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:48,107
...to see if there's any way
we can help resolve the situation.

1093
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:52,547
There's only one solution. That's
for this man to change his mind and run.

1094
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,860
Don't state the obvious, Cadogan.

1095
01:24:54,950 --> 01:24:59,740
We've to explore ways in which we can help
this young man to reach that decisión.

1096
01:25:00,110 --> 01:25:02,101
I'm afraid there are no ways, sir.

1097
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:05,341
I won't run on the Sabbath and that's final.

1098
01:25:06,750 --> 01:25:09,867
I intended to confirm this
with Lord Birkenhead tonight...

1099
01:25:09,950 --> 01:25:13,067
...even before you called me up
before this inquisition.

1100
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,503
Don't be impertinent.

1101
01:25:14,590 --> 01:25:18,947
The impertinence lies with those who
seek to influence a man to deny his beliefs.

1102
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:22,306
On the contrary, Liddell.
We're appealing to your beliefs.

1103
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:25,587
In your country and your king.
Your loyalty to them.

1104
01:25:25,670 --> 01:25:30,460
Hear, hear.
In my day, it was king first, God after.

1105
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:33,269
And the war to end wars
bitterly proved your point.

1106
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:36,949
God made countries. God makes kings...

1107
01:25:37,030 --> 01:25:39,100
...and the rules by which they govern.

1108
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:44,665
And those rules say that the Sabbath is his.

1109
01:25:45,670 --> 01:25:47,979
And I for one intend to keep it that way.

1110
01:25:50,950 --> 01:25:52,941
Mr Liddell.

1111
01:25:53,030 --> 01:25:55,828
You're a child of your race... as I am.

1112
01:25:55,910 --> 01:26:00,267
We share a common heritage,
a common bond, a common... loyalty.

1113
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:04,107
There are times when
we are asked to make sacrifices...

1114
01:26:04,190 --> 01:26:06,181
...in the name of that loyalty...

1115
01:26:06,270 --> 01:26:09,660
...and without them
our allegiance is worthless.

1116
01:26:09,750 --> 01:26:11,866
As I see it, for you...

1117
01:26:12,630 --> 01:26:14,621
...this is such a time.

1118
01:26:15,070 --> 01:26:17,061
Sir...

1119
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,981
God knows, I love my country.

1120
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:24,146
But I can't make that sacrifice.

1121
01:26:30,510 --> 01:26:32,501
Come in!

1122
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:36,264
Your Royal Highness... Lord Lindsay.

1123
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:44,108
Your Highness, Cadogan, gentlemen.

1124
01:26:44,190 --> 01:26:46,829
I do apologise for barging in like this.

1125
01:26:46,910 --> 01:26:49,344
The fact is
I am fully aware of Eric's dilemma.

1126
01:26:50,150 --> 01:26:54,063
I wondered if I could be so bold
as to suggest a possible solution.

1127
01:26:54,870 --> 01:26:56,588
Do.

1128
01:26:56,670 --> 01:26:58,262
Yes.

1129
01:26:58,350 --> 01:27:00,341
Another day, another race.

1130
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,421
What the devil's that supposed to mean?

1131
01:27:02,510 --> 01:27:04,660
It's quite simple as a matter of fact, sir.

1132
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:07,025
The 400 metres. It's on Thursday.

1133
01:27:07,110 --> 01:27:09,101
I've already got my medal.

1134
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:12,899
So why don't you let Eric
take my place in the quarter?

1135
01:27:15,470 --> 01:27:17,188
I think that's a splendid idea.

1136
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,342
Can we allow him to change events
at such short notice?

1137
01:27:21,830 --> 01:27:24,105
That's a matter for the committee.

1138
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:26,226
We <i>are</i> the committee.

1139
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:28,861
I think it's a very good idea.

1140
01:27:29,190 --> 01:27:31,181
David?

1141
01:27:32,030 --> 01:27:34,021
All those in favour say aye.

1142
01:27:34,110 --> 01:27:35,987
Aye.

1143
01:27:36,070 --> 01:27:38,061
Liddell?

1144
01:27:38,510 --> 01:27:40,660
- Andy, I...
- A pleasure, old chap.

1145
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:44,461
Just to see you run.

1146
01:27:48,190 --> 01:27:50,181
Aye.

1147
01:27:50,270 --> 01:27:52,101
Well, that's settled.

1148
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:58,941
A sticky moment, George.

1149
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:02,899
Thank God for Lindsay.
I thought the lad had us beaten.

1150
01:28:02,990 --> 01:28:04,981
He did have us beaten, FE.

1151
01:28:05,070 --> 01:28:08,142
- And thank God he did.
- I don't quite follow you.

1152
01:28:08,230 --> 01:28:11,028
The lad, as you call him,
is a true man of principle...

1153
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,748
...and a true athlete.

1154
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:15,822
His speed is a mere extensión
of his life, its force.

1155
01:28:16,510 --> 01:28:19,024
We sought to sever his running
from himself.

1156
01:28:19,110 --> 01:28:21,101
For his country's sake, yes.

1157
01:28:21,190 --> 01:28:23,181
No sake is worth that, FE.

1158
01:28:23,910 --> 01:28:26,299
Least of all a guilty national pride.

1159
01:28:42,510 --> 01:28:44,819
<i>"Lindsay makes way for Liddell."</i>

1160
01:28:44,950 --> 01:28:47,669
"400 metres for defecting Scot."

1161
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:50,344
"'Smacks of fanaticism,' says official."

1162
01:28:50,430 --> 01:28:52,546
"'Man of principle,' says primate."

1163
01:28:52,630 --> 01:28:54,621
"We should be proud."

1164
01:29:34,350 --> 01:29:37,740
- So that's the Olympic Stadium.
- That's it, Sam.

1165
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:39,866
It's as good as being in there, isn't it?

1166
01:29:39,950 --> 01:29:42,669
Better! Seeing as I'm <i>persona non grata.</i>

1167
01:29:44,430 --> 01:29:45,988
Yeah.

1168
01:29:46,070 --> 01:29:48,868
It's tiptop, Mr Abrahams.
You've done a grand job.

1169
01:29:48,950 --> 01:29:50,941
If we don't win now, we never will.

1170
01:29:51,030 --> 01:29:53,590
Have I got everything, Sam?
Everything you need?

1171
01:29:53,670 --> 01:29:55,626
Er...

1172
01:29:58,950 --> 01:30:00,542
Yes.

1173
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:03,221
All we need now is Sunday.

1174
01:30:24,430 --> 01:30:29,106
My text this afternoon
is taken from Isaiah, chapter 40.

1175
01:30:31,830 --> 01:30:33,821
Behold.

1176
01:30:34,750 --> 01:30:36,945
The nations are as a drop in the bucket...

1177
01:30:38,110 --> 01:30:41,102
<i>... and are counted</i>
<i>as the small dust in the balance.</i>

1178
01:30:43,670 --> 01:30:46,707
<i>All nations before him are as nothing.</i>

1179
01:30:48,150 --> 01:30:50,584
They are counted to him less than nothing...

1180
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:52,388
...and vanity.

1181
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:56,820
He bringeth the princes to nothing.

1182
01:30:58,030 --> 01:31:01,261
He maketh the judges of the earth as a vanity.

1183
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:04,901
Hast thou not known?

1184
01:31:06,110 --> 01:31:08,101
<i>Hast thou not heard...</i>

1185
01:31:08,590 --> 01:31:12,139
<i>... that the everlasting God, the Lord...</i>

1186
01:31:12,230 --> 01:31:14,585
<i>... the creator of the ends of the earth...</i>

1187
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,501
<i>... fainteth not...</i>

1188
01:31:16,590 --> 01:31:18,581
<i>... neither is weary?</i>

1189
01:31:18,670 --> 01:31:20,661
Juvenile!

1190
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:27,221
Oldest con in the business.

1191
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:29,619
I know, Sam.

1192
01:31:29,710 --> 01:31:32,144
He giveth power to the faint...

1193
01:31:32,950 --> 01:31:35,145
...and to them that have no strength...

1194
01:31:36,310 --> 01:31:38,301
...he increaseth might.

1195
01:31:41,350 --> 01:31:43,500
<i>But they that wait upon the Lord...</i>

1196
01:31:44,510 --> 01:31:46,501
<i>... shall renew their strength.</i>

1197
01:31:47,190 --> 01:31:49,181
<i>They shall mount up...</i>

1198
01:31:50,190 --> 01:31:53,068
...with wings, as eagles.

1199
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:57,100
<i>They shall run...</i>

1200
01:31:57,190 --> 01:31:59,181
<i>... and not be weary.</i>

1201
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:02,581
<i>They shall walk...</i>

1202
01:32:03,190 --> 01:32:05,181
<i>... and not faint.</i>

1203
01:32:36,590 --> 01:32:40,424
Do you remember when we first
bumped into each other, old man?

1204
01:32:41,870 --> 01:32:43,861
We shared a taxi, remember?

1205
01:32:46,430 --> 01:32:48,500
You made me feel...

1206
01:32:48,590 --> 01:32:51,582
...an age old, burdened, sour...

1207
01:32:52,230 --> 01:32:54,221
Even superior.

1208
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:58,024
That was <i>the</i> miscalculation of my life.

1209
01:33:00,070 --> 01:33:02,265
You, Aubrey...

1210
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:04,625
...are my most complete man.

1211
01:33:04,710 --> 01:33:06,701
You're brave...

1212
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:08,667
...compassionate...

1213
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:10,627
...kind.

1214
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,701
A content man.

1215
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:14,826
That's your secret.

1216
01:33:14,910 --> 01:33:16,901
Contentment.

1217
01:33:17,950 --> 01:33:19,941
I'm 24 and I've never known it.

1218
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:25,344
I'm forever in pursuit and I don't
even know what it is I'm chasing.

1219
01:33:30,790 --> 01:33:32,781
Aubrey, old chap, I'm scared.

1220
01:33:35,630 --> 01:33:39,543
Sam and I, we've laboured,
rowed and bullied for this.

1221
01:33:40,910 --> 01:33:42,901
Day in, day out.

1222
01:33:43,110 --> 01:33:45,908
You've seen us -
chuckled over us, I'll be bound.

1223
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:47,867
Out in all weathers.

1224
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:49,941
Madmen.

1225
01:33:50,350 --> 01:33:52,341
And for what?

1226
01:33:53,350 --> 01:33:55,500
I was beaten out of sight in the 200.

1227
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:59,299
Then I let Paddock trick me in the semi.

1228
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:04,022
Now, in one hour's time,
I'll be out there again.

1229
01:34:04,950 --> 01:34:08,260
I'll raise my eyes
and look down that corridor...

1230
01:34:08,350 --> 01:34:12,821
...four-feet wide with ten lonely seconds
to justify my whole existence.

1231
01:34:15,390 --> 01:34:17,381
But will I?

1232
01:34:22,190 --> 01:34:24,385
Aubrey, I've known the fear of losing.

1233
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:27,499
But now I'm almost too frightened to win.

1234
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,868
<i> Dear Mr Abrahams.</i>

1235
01:35:34,950 --> 01:35:38,306
<i>You must please pardon</i>
<i>my not coming to see you run...</i>

1236
01:35:38,390 --> 01:35:40,585
<i>... much as I would like to do so.</i>

1237
01:35:40,670 --> 01:35:44,583
<i>However, I believe and hope you will win...</i>

1238
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:46,661
<i>... the 100 metres.</i>

1239
01:35:46,990 --> 01:35:49,185
<i>Go out determined to do your best.</i>

1240
01:35:49,270 --> 01:35:51,067
<i>And don't forget...</i>

1241
01:35:51,150 --> 01:35:53,948
<i>... drop down at the first stride.</i>

1242
01:35:55,230 --> 01:35:57,539
<i>Get well warmed up...</i>

1243
01:35:57,630 --> 01:35:59,780
<i>... and then let the gun release you.</i>

1244
01:36:01,430 --> 01:36:05,105
<i>I should use the springy old six-spike shoes.</i>

1245
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:08,661
<i>All the best of luck.</i>

1246
01:36:08,750 --> 01:36:10,820
<i>From yours truly, Sam Mussabini.</i>

1247
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:17,546
<i>PS. Please accept the charm.</i>

1248
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:20,098
<i>My old father swore by it.</i>

1249
01:37:21,990 --> 01:37:25,778
No regrets, Eric,
that you're not down there with them?

1250
01:37:27,910 --> 01:37:29,901
Yeah.

1251
01:37:30,910 --> 01:37:32,901
No doubts, though.

1252
01:37:33,430 --> 01:37:36,866
Your Royal Highness, may I present
Mr Bowman of the United States?

1253
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,747
Mr Bowman.

1254
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:41,025
- Mr Murchison.
- Mr Murchison.

1255
01:37:41,750 --> 01:37:44,105
And Mr Watson of New Zealand
I believe you know.

1256
01:37:44,190 --> 01:37:46,704
- Oh, yes, Mr Watson. How are you?
- Very well, sir.

1257
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:48,109
Good.

1258
01:37:48,190 --> 01:37:51,023
- Mr Paddock.
- Ah, Mr Paddock.

1259
01:37:51,110 --> 01:37:54,261
Dinner for your whole team at my club
when we get back to London.

1260
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:58,059
Now if you win, I pay,
Abrahams wins, you pay, all right?

1261
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:01,943
Sir, you have yourself a deal.

1262
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:04,268
Done.

1263
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,500
- The best of luck to you.
- And to you, sir.

1264
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,581
- Mr Scholz.
- Scholz.

1265
01:38:08,670 --> 01:38:10,740
And this is our Harold Abrahams.

1266
01:38:10,830 --> 01:38:12,946
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

1267
01:38:13,030 --> 01:38:15,260
Do your best. That's all we can expect.

1268
01:38:16,310 --> 01:38:18,540
- Good luck, Abrahams.
- Thank you, sir.

1269
01:38:18,870 --> 01:38:20,861
Come on, Charlie!

1270
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:33,539
Charlie, Charlie, rah rah rah!

1271
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:54,222
<i>Prêt!</i>

1272
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:55,982
Head down.

1273
01:40:56,070 --> 01:40:58,061
<i> Watch the first stride.</i>

1274
01:40:58,910 --> 01:41:00,901
<i>Go for release.</i>

1275
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:18,826
<i> Premier...</i>

1276
01:42:18,910 --> 01:42:20,901
<i>... numéro 419.</i>

1277
01:42:21,550 --> 01:42:24,542
<i>Abrahams, Grande Bretagne.</i>

1278
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:30,945
<i>Temps, 10 secondes, trois cinquièmes.</i>

1279
01:42:31,030 --> 01:42:34,659
<i>Second, 74.</i>

1280
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:36,706
<i>Scholz, États Unis.</i>

1281
01:43:21,790 --> 01:43:23,781
Harold!

1282
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:43,741
My son.

1283
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:06,661
- Harold!
- Ssh, ssh, ssh!

1284
01:44:06,750 --> 01:44:08,820
Leave him be. The poor fella's whacked.

1285
01:44:08,910 --> 01:44:11,219
- But he won!
- Exactly.

1286
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:14,507
One of these days, Monty,
you're going to win yourself.

1287
01:44:14,590 --> 01:44:16,979
And it's pretty difficult to swallow.

1288
01:44:23,710 --> 01:44:25,541
<i>- </i>
- Come in.

1289
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:28,706
Mrs Abrahams just rang, miss.

1290
01:44:28,790 --> 01:44:31,748
The <i>Daily Express.</i>
They've been on from Paris.

1291
01:44:31,830 --> 01:44:33,627
Mr 'Arold. He won!

1292
01:44:33,710 --> 01:44:35,541
She told me to tell you he won!

1293
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:39,021
Thank you very much, Bill.

1294
01:44:41,350 --> 01:44:44,148
Oh, it's 15 minutes to curtain-up, miss.

1295
01:44:57,230 --> 01:44:59,221
He did it, sir.

1296
01:45:03,950 --> 01:45:05,941
Thank you, Matthews.

1297
01:45:07,150 --> 01:45:09,141
"Abrahams triumphant."

1298
01:45:10,350 --> 01:45:13,740
"Caius College athlete
wins blue riband at Games."

1299
01:45:15,190 --> 01:45:17,181
Just as I expected.

1300
01:45:27,510 --> 01:45:31,344
Yes, you've always thought
of yourself as a ruthless man. Hard.

1301
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:33,261
Bit of a loner, like me.

1302
01:45:34,750 --> 01:45:37,583
But actually,
you're as soft as a limp pocket.

1303
01:45:39,190 --> 01:45:41,181
Oh, you care.

1304
01:45:43,150 --> 01:45:45,539
Care about things that really matter.

1305
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:49,945
If you didn't, I wouldn't have come
within a mile of you.

1306
01:45:54,350 --> 01:45:56,659
Do you know who you won for
out there today?

1307
01:45:57,190 --> 01:45:59,260
Hmm?

1308
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:01,227
Us!

1309
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:04,141
You and old Sam Mussabini.

1310
01:46:05,670 --> 01:46:07,820
I've waited 30 bloody years for this.

1311
01:46:07,910 --> 01:46:10,822
<i>Pardon, messieurs. Il faut partir maintenant.</i>

1312
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:12,742
<i>Il est trois heures du matin.</i>

1313
01:46:12,830 --> 01:46:13,819
Oh!

1314
01:46:15,510 --> 01:46:17,501
Harold!

1315
01:46:19,150 --> 01:46:21,584
It means the worid to me, this, you know.

1316
01:46:23,750 --> 01:46:25,866
And if all the worid can do...

1317
01:46:25,950 --> 01:46:29,340
...is to want to go home to bed,
then they can go to hell!

1318
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:32,746
Because we've had today...

1319
01:46:32,830 --> 01:46:34,661
...you and me...

1320
01:46:34,750 --> 01:46:36,741
...and we've got it for keeps.

1321
01:46:37,870 --> 01:46:39,906
So now it's out o' yer system...

1322
01:46:39,990 --> 01:46:43,585
...go home to that girl o' yours
and start some bloody living.

1323
01:46:43,670 --> 01:46:45,262
Yes?

1324
01:46:55,950 --> 01:46:58,180
- To Sam Mussabini.
- Oh.

1325
01:46:58,270 --> 01:47:00,909
The greatest trainer in the worid.

1326
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,909
Hm?

1327
01:47:10,550 --> 01:47:12,666
Tell him. Get some more.

1328
01:47:12,750 --> 01:47:15,184
Come on, Sam. We're going home.

1329
01:47:38,310 --> 01:47:40,301
<i> The final of the 400 metres.</i>

1330
01:47:41,310 --> 01:47:43,585
<i>Taylor. États Unis.</i>

1331
01:47:43,670 --> 01:47:46,389
<i>Numéro 278.</i>

1332
01:47:46,750 --> 01:47:50,026
Good luck. Don't expect
I'll see you till after the race.

1333
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:57,862
What's the deal with this guy Liddell?
Is he a problem?

1334
01:47:57,950 --> 01:47:59,941
No problem. He's a flyer.

1335
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:02,669
He's had two races today already. He'll die.

1336
01:48:03,630 --> 01:48:06,463
Just swing along, you guys, and wait.

1337
01:48:07,950 --> 01:48:11,340
After 300 metres, rigor mortis sets in.

1338
01:48:11,430 --> 01:48:13,421
You'll pull him in on a rope.

1339
01:48:18,350 --> 01:48:20,147
Good luck, Taylor.

1340
01:48:20,230 --> 01:48:22,698
- Watch out for Liddell.
- Coach says no problem.

1341
01:48:22,790 --> 01:48:24,781
He's got something personal to prove.

1342
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:27,509
Something guys like Coach'll
never understand.

1343
01:48:31,870 --> 01:48:33,462
Excuse me.

01:48:33,550 --> 01:48:35,541

01:48:47,950 --> 01:48:51,784
It says in the Old Book,
"He that honours me...

1347
01:48:51,870 --> 01:48:54,304
...I will honour."

1348
01:48:54,750 --> 01:48:56,945

<i> So where does the power come from...</i>

1352
01:49:29,190 --> 01:49:31,101
<i>... to see the race to its end?</i>

1353
01:49:31,190 --> 01:49:32,669
<i>From within.</i>

1354
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:43,827
