1
00:00:19,253 --> 00:00:23,155
"You are standing in the cavern
of the evil wizard.

2
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:27,389
All around you are the carcasses
of slain ice dwarfs."

3
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:35,800
Melt... Melt wizard.

4
00:00:37,676 --> 00:00:40,373
"What do you want to melt him with?"

5
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,645
Josh!

6
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,871
What do you think I
want to melt him with?

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,886
- I told you to take out the garbage!
- Just a second!

8
00:00:46,987 --> 00:00:49,547
Throw thermal...

9
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:51,448
Josh! Didn't you hear
what your mother said?

10
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:52,674
One minute!

11
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:55,230
Joshua Baskin!

12
00:00:57,634 --> 00:01:00,569
"Your hesitancy has cost you dearly.

13
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:03,765
"The wizard, sensing
your apprehension...

14
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,400
"unleashes a fatal bolt
from the ice scepter.

15
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:11,108
With luck, you
will thaw in several million years."

16
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:12,876
Great.

17
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:25,290
Come on, Josh.
It's starting to stink up the place.

18
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,858
Okay, okay, okay.

19
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:33,908
Take the garbage out.
Every day, take the garbage out. There!

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,380
The teams are being led into the field,
and the crowds are going crazy! Yeah! Yeah!

21
00:01:38,482 --> 00:01:41,814
And wait a minute. It's the Yankees'
star pitcher coming out of the bullpen.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,582
Look at him! And the crowds
are cheering. They're going crazy!

23
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,022
- They're screaming! Is Billy there? Okay.
- In the back.

24
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:49,594
Rick Rhoden is on the mound
for the Yankees.

25
00:01:49,695 --> 00:01:52,721
He looks into the catcher's mitt,
shakes off the first signal...

26
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:55,268
takes the turn.

27
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:59,932
He wipes the sweat off his brow,
leans back and fires.

28
00:02:00,042 --> 00:02:04,945
Yeah! Good-bye,
Mr. Spalding!

29
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:09,876
Here, here. Wait.

30
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:12,683
Got it, need it, need it, got it.

31
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,054
- Oh!
- Hey, hey, hey!

32
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,596
You ever go by Simpson's desk
when she's grading papers or somethin'?

33
00:02:18,698 --> 00:02:21,394
She leaned over,
you can see right down her shirt.

34
00:02:21,501 --> 00:02:23,731
No.
Swear to God.

35
00:02:23,837 --> 00:02:25,202
- Bra?
- No, no.

36
00:02:25,227 --> 00:02:27,229
She's got one of those
undershirt things.

37
00:02:27,308 --> 00:02:30,072
So if you get real close
to the board...

38
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:33,614
you can see all the way down
to her flowers.

39
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:35,649
Whoa!

40
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:38,311
Yeah. Give me your gum.

41
00:02:40,157 --> 00:02:42,819
- Need it, got it, got it, need it.
- Hey, hey.

42
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:47,627
- Give me a dollar! Give me...
- Oh, my God. It's Cynthia.

43
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:51,225
How did a geek like Freddie Benson
get a sister like that?

44
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:53,305
Beats me.

45
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,908
I mean, imagine having
a boyfriend like that.

46
00:02:58,933 --> 00:03:00,134
Hi, Josh.

47
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:05,313
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. It's Billy.

48
00:03:05,421 --> 00:03:07,285
- Come on!
- Don't start.

49
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,189
He says hi!

50
00:03:10,294 --> 00:03:13,724
Come on, Miss Cheapo.
A quarter! A quarter.

51
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:14,950
Unbelievable!

52
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:18,469
God. She likes you.
I know she likes you. I'll find out, okay?

53
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:47,467
- Don't forget to call me after supper.
- Okay.

54
00:03:47,573 --> 00:03:50,371
- Remember about Cynthia.
- Don't worry!

55
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:51,305
I'm as interested as you are.

56
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:54,722
This isn't fair.

57
00:03:54,824 --> 00:03:57,418
Buddy, we've been
talkin' about this for months.

58
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,553
You knew this was gonna happen
when Rachel got older.

59
00:03:59,663 --> 00:04:03,155
- Why can't she stay in your room?
- Because.

60
00:04:03,268 --> 00:04:07,568
Bein' part of a family
means sharing responsibilities.

61
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:12,269
Great. But do I have to share my room?

62
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:17,147
I'm a person. I am not your maid.

63
00:04:17,251 --> 00:04:19,378
Can any of you appreciate that?

64
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:24,254
You waltz in here like
it's some kind of a resort...

65
00:04:24,359 --> 00:04:27,227
lounging around,
waiting for your dinner to be cooked...

66
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,730
your clothes to be ironed.

67
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:34,602
What about me, huh? Have you ever once
thought about how I feel?

68
00:04:34,706 --> 00:04:39,268
Do you know what it's like to work
eight hours and come home to this?

69
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:43,180
Every single day?

70
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,543
None of you ever offer to help me!

71
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,620
Why?

72
00:04:49,657 --> 00:04:52,455
I can't do it alone anymore.

73
00:04:54,063 --> 00:04:58,466
Just can't.

74
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:02,527
And if you tell them anything
that goes on in this room...

75
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,539
well, you'll be sorry.

76
00:05:08,881 --> 00:05:10,678
So, will you tell me?

77
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:15,419
- You're in.
- What do you mean, I'm in?

78
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,821
- Cynthia Benson.
- What about her?

79
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:22,661
You ready for this?
She doesn't like Barry anymore.

80
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:24,139
So?

81
00:05:24,165 --> 00:05:26,456
So what do you mean, "so"?
That's it. She's available.

82
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:31,466
- Billy, it doesn't mean...
- Josh.

83
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:36,469
Hey, it's after midnight.

84
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,413
- Now, say good night to Billy.
- Good night, Billy. I gotta go.

85
00:05:40,852 --> 00:05:44,252
Good night, Mrs. Baskin!

86
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,019
Sweet dreams.

87
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:57,529
All right. Come on.

88
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,541
One dollar. Come on, kid.

89
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:03,976
Watch this.
Need some help with the hammer?

90
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,548
Okay. I'm ready.
Here I go. Here I go.

91
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,779
I get one more try. One more try.

92
00:06:09,887 --> 00:06:13,448
Okay, honey.
Big smile. Big smile.

93
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,221
- Go! Go! Go!
- Good. Good.

94
00:06:17,996 --> 00:06:20,055
Oh, "wimpy"!
Better luck next time.

95
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,295
Let me get one more try? Please?
Come on! I can't live with "wimpy."

96
00:06:23,404 --> 00:06:25,895
Mommy! Make it stop!

97
00:06:29,077 --> 00:06:31,739
You sure you want to
go on this thing, son?

98
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:33,645
- Yeah.
- No, no.

99
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,172
I don't know about this one, Bob.

100
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,551
- No, this looks too scary.
- It's okay.

101
00:06:39,656 --> 00:06:43,057
- Oh, my God.
- See? I told you.

102
00:06:43,161 --> 00:06:45,721
He doesn't want to go on it.

103
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,994
Son, you don't have to go on this thing
if you don't feel like it.

104
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:51,831
No, no. It's just that I...
I want to go on myself.

105
00:06:51,937 --> 00:06:53,996
- You do?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:54,107 --> 00:06:55,701
I think it's something...

107
00:06:55,726 --> 00:06:57,727
Yeah, I think it's
something I should do.

108
00:06:57,812 --> 00:07:01,248
Great. Why don't we meet you
at the Ferris wheel?

109
00:07:02,618 --> 00:07:05,349
Half hour.

110
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:07,513
- Excuse me.
- Hey!

111
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:10,287
What are you doing? Come on, man.

112
00:07:10,394 --> 00:07:13,090
Watch it.

113
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:17,827
Sal threw up on the other ride.

114
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,609
It was disgusting.

115
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:26,474
Josh?

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,639
- Oh. Hi.
- Hi.

117
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,945
Have you been on this before?

118
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:33,543
- This?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:33,656 --> 00:07:35,681
- Yes.
- Is it scary?

120
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:40,354
- Yes.
- Are you here alone?

121
00:07:42,532 --> 00:07:44,625
Yes.

122
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:47,295
Look. Aren't those
your parents?

123
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:50,398
- Where?
- Right over there.

124
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:52,534
Honey! Smile!

125
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:56,106
Why, yes.

126
00:07:56,216 --> 00:07:58,274
- Hey, who's this?
- This is Josh Baskin.

127
00:07:58,385 --> 00:08:00,352
- How you doin'?
- This is Derek.

128
00:08:00,454 --> 00:08:03,515
- He drives.
- Next.

129
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,526
- Go ahead.
- Yo, next!

130
00:08:06,628 --> 00:08:08,687
- Go ahead.
- Yo, next!

131
00:08:09,965 --> 00:08:12,832
Whoa! Read this sign.

132
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:15,035
"You must be at least
this big to ride this ride."

133
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,261
What? Oh.

134
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,137
Hey, I don't make the rules, kid.

135
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:22,337
Next!

136
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,881
Well, it's a stupid rule.

137
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:27,680
Look, why don't you
try the Kiddie Whip?

138
00:08:30,391 --> 00:08:33,361
Yeah, it's about time.
You. You.

139
00:08:33,462 --> 00:08:36,897
- See you, Josh.
- No problem. Step up.

140
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:47,940
- Hey, watch it, kid!
- Hey. Come on, you guys. Let's go.

141
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:21,918
"Drop 25 cents here."

142
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,527
Come on!

143
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:45,037
Work! Work!

144
00:09:57,362 --> 00:10:00,024
Neat!

145
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,580
Make my wish. Right.

146
00:10:17,887 --> 00:10:19,912
I wish I were big.

147
00:10:42,818 --> 00:10:44,911
"Your wish is granted."

148
00:11:04,644 --> 00:11:07,204
Somebody's gonna get you!

149
00:11:07,314 --> 00:11:10,112
Come on. Go! Come on!

150
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:34,378
What's the matter?

151
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,541
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

152
00:11:38,652 --> 00:11:40,711
No.

153
00:11:40,821 --> 00:11:43,585
Honey, you'll wake up your brother.

154
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:46,752
Come on. Come on.
You sleep with us.

155
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:58,235
Easy, doggie!
Easy! Don't make me do it.

156
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:01,210
I'm only part-time. Sorry.

157
00:12:03,983 --> 00:12:06,008
Josh!

158
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,217
Josh!

159
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,824
- Josh!
- What?

160
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:18,461
It's 7:30. Are you up?

161
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:27,735
Come on, sleepyhead! You're gonna miss
the bus, and I can't drive you today.

162
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:26,649
What does he do in his sleep?

163
00:13:45,371 --> 00:13:48,898
Honey? I put out some clean clothes.

164
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:52,410
Bring down your dungarees
and stuff for the laundry, okay?

165
00:13:52,514 --> 00:13:56,041
- Okay.
- You getting a cold, Josh?

166
00:13:56,152 --> 00:13:58,177
No. Fine.

167
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,928
He's got a cold.

168
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,058
Now Rachel's gonna get a cold, I'm gonna
get a cold, his father's gonna get a cold.

169
00:14:18,011 --> 00:14:20,639
Oh, my God.

170
00:14:20,748 --> 00:14:24,309
- Breakfast is ready, Josh.
- Be right there!

171
00:14:40,605 --> 00:14:44,097
Josh! Hurry up!
Your eggs are getting cold.

172
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,515
Hold this. Hold this. Good.
Now, can you keep it a secret?

173
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:52,814
Yeah. Keep it a secret.

174
00:14:52,921 --> 00:14:55,948
Bring down Rachel with you, all right?

175
00:14:56,058 --> 00:15:00,154
Okay.

176
00:15:00,262 --> 00:15:02,492
Come on. Come on.

177
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:05,864
Oh, yeah. Shh, shh, shh.
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

178
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:12,104
You want orange juice or

179
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:14,509
What about your breakfast?

180
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:30,432
- Don't. Please, don't! Don't! Please!
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

181
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:37,240
- No!
- It's me.

182
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:40,747
- It's Josh. Mom! Mom.
- Stop it! Oh, God!

183
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:43,216
- I made a wish last night.
- Oh, please, stop!

184
00:16:43,322 --> 00:16:45,381
I turned into a grown-up.
I made this wish on the machine.

185
00:16:45,406 --> 00:16:46,490
Go away!

186
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,426
It turned me into a grown-up.
Last night at the carnival.

187
00:16:48,451 --> 00:16:49,528
No! No!

188
00:16:49,529 --> 00:16:52,396
My birthday's November 3.
Mom, I got a "B" on my history test.

189
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:55,400
Here, take the purse.
You can have anything that's in it! Go away!

190
00:16:55,502 --> 00:16:59,165
M-M-M-My baseball team is
called the Dukes!

191
00:16:59,274 --> 00:17:01,936
Uh, I made this for you.
Who are you calling?

192
00:17:02,043 --> 00:17:07,071
I have a
birthmark behind my left knee!

193
00:17:07,183 --> 00:17:10,619
- You bastard. What did you do to my son?
- I am your son, Mom.

194
00:17:10,721 --> 00:17:14,020
- Where is my child? Where is my son?
- Oh, Ma! Ma! Ma!

195
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:17,357
Police!

196
00:17:17,463 --> 00:17:19,362
Hands up!

197
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:21,956
Hands up on defense!

198
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:25,128
Come on! All the way. All the way.

199
00:17:25,238 --> 00:17:28,605
- It's all yours!
- All right, stop!

200
00:17:28,709 --> 00:17:31,941
I'm open! Here! I'm open!

201
00:17:32,047 --> 00:17:35,312
Shoot it! Yeah!

202
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:41,251
Gentlemen, this period is over.

203
00:17:41,276 --> 00:17:42,477
You stink, Kopecki!

204
00:17:42,659 --> 00:17:45,092
Get back to the locker rooms
and get on to your next class.

205
00:17:45,117 --> 00:17:46,318
Billy, you stink!

206
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,532
Wash shirts and shorts.

207
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,864
Billy, do us both a favor.

208
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:54,633
Put the balls in the equipment closet
and you practice your layup.

209
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,834
Horowitz, pick up that shirt
or I'll make you eat it. It stinks!

210
00:17:57,944 --> 00:18:00,641
Let's go, gentlemen.
Hey, let's go now.

211
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:02,772
- Billy.
- Yeah?

212
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:06,077
- What?
- It's me.

213
00:18:07,824 --> 00:18:11,920
- It's Josh.
- Coach Barnes!

214
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:14,519
- No! Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Coach Barnes!

215
00:18:14,631 --> 00:18:17,998
Billy, shut up! I'm your best friend!
Please, you gotta believe me.

216
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,332
- Don't hurt me.
- I'll prove it to you. Billy, please!

217
00:18:20,439 --> 00:18:23,375
- Look, I'm not gonna hurt you!
- Help! Help!

218
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:26,001
Goddamn it, Billy Francis Kopecki!

219
00:18:26,112 --> 00:18:28,170
Look, I know I don't look
like myself, okay?

220
00:18:28,282 --> 00:18:32,184
But something really strange happened,
and I'm really scared! I need your help!

221
00:18:32,287 --> 00:18:34,778
You're my best friend!
I can prove it to you.

222
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:09,397
Josh?

223
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:15,999
You look terrible.

224
00:19:16,106 --> 00:19:16,834
I know.

225
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:22,890
He had on a blue, uh,
sweatshirt with a hood on it...

226
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,896
that said "Giants" across the front.

227
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,163
He... He ran in here.
He ran into the kitchen.

228
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:31,967
He followed me a-around
that pillar there...

229
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:35,944
and when I got into the kitchen, he turned
around and he pulled down his pants...

230
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:39,016
and he exposed his heinie.

231
00:19:39,116 --> 00:19:43,520
I... I can't. I can't.

232
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:48,955
I was in the house making gravy,
and I heard this commotion.

233
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:51,326
That's right.
We're at the scene right now.

234
00:19:51,432 --> 00:19:53,491
We've talked to the mother.
She's pretty hysterical.

235
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:56,263
She's not making any sense at all.

236
00:19:56,372 --> 00:19:58,863
There's no ransom note, no prints.
There's no nothing;

237
00:19:58,974 --> 00:20:01,966
I'll tell you what-
file a report, be on the safe side.

238
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:04,273
- Shut up!
- Bet he ran away.

239
00:20:04,381 --> 00:20:07,442
- Wish I could.
- Want me to pack your bags?

240
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,922
It's me.

241
00:20:13,992 --> 00:20:16,290
You couldn't wish
for a million dollars?

242
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:20,623
Take that off. Don't worry.
I got it all figured out.

243
00:20:20,735 --> 00:20:22,828
Go to the city,
lay low for a couple days...

244
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,735
find that Zoltar thing,
make your wish.

245
00:20:25,841 --> 00:20:27,739
You'll be home by Thursday.

246
00:20:28,909 --> 00:20:31,137
It grew all over.

247
00:20:31,243 --> 00:20:34,370
- Hmm.
- Why can't I just tell them what happened?

248
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:36,878
You did, and your mom
tried to kill you.

249
00:20:38,782 --> 00:20:41,341
I'm gonna get in one
awful lot of trouble because of this.

250
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,441
They'll probably be so happy to see you,
you'll probably get a new bike out of it.

251
00:20:45,552 --> 00:20:47,781
- Come on. Let's get going.
- Oh!

252
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,825
Excuse me.

253
00:20:58,928 --> 00:21:01,417
Thanks.

254
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,429
She's a problem.

255
00:21:03,531 --> 00:21:06,397
This is the time of day
when she gets cranky and she cries.

256
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:08,433
She does it every day.

257
00:21:08,534 --> 00:21:10,763
I'm not supposed to go to
New York without my folks.

258
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,632
You'll be all right. Here.

259
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,199
- Where did you get that?
- My father's sock drawer.

260
00:21:20,308 --> 00:21:23,208
- You stole it?
- It's his emergency fund.

261
00:21:51,928 --> 00:21:55,760
Fine! Fine. Fine.
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

262
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:58,764
Kill the bitch. Kill her with a knife.
Kill her with a knife!

263
00:21:58,866 --> 00:22:01,993
Kill the bitch. Kill the bitch.
Kill her with a knife.

264
00:22:02,101 --> 00:22:04,500
Put it in. Bitch!
Kill the bitch!

265
00:22:04,604 --> 00:22:06,627
Kill her!

266
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:17,238
- You lookin' for some fun tonight, sweet thing?
- No, thank you.

267
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:20,006
- Hey, man. Spare some change?
- No, not really.

268
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:22,170
Hey, this looks okay.

269
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:25,215
No, it doesn't.

270
00:22:25,316 --> 00:22:27,647
St. James, Josh. It's religious.

271
00:22:32,455 --> 00:22:36,355
Stay out there all night,
all day and all night again?

272
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:46,593
- Hi.
- Hi.

273
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:53,592
Uh, we would like
a hotel room, please.

274
00:22:53,701 --> 00:22:58,601
17.50 a night for the room,
$10 deposit for the sheets.

275
00:23:01,973 --> 00:23:04,030
Mm-hmm.

276
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:06,267
You go straight
to the top of the stairs.

277
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:09,936
The last door on the right,
next to the bathroom.

278
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:13,138
Wait a second.
I'll show you.

279
00:23:16,349 --> 00:23:18,372
- It smells bad.
- Shh.

280
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,747
- Have a pleasant stay.
- Thanks.

281
00:23:20,853 --> 00:23:24,150
Hey, Angel!
Get out of that bathroom now!

282
00:23:26,023 --> 00:23:28,354
He's in that bathroom all night.

283
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:32,553
I don't want to stay here by myself.

284
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,219
I can't help it, Josh.
I gotta be home by 10:00.

285
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:41,922
Look, I'll cut classes tomorrow.

286
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:46,661
We'll find that Zoltar thing
before you know it, okay?

287
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:49,293
Just one night. All right?

288
00:23:49,404 --> 00:23:53,133
- All right.
- Good.

289
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,730
- What if I can't sleep?
- It's probably better if you don't.

290
00:23:58,543 --> 00:24:00,600
See you in the morning.

291
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:05,339
- Well, you know, like, what time?
- 8:30.

292
00:24:09,785 --> 00:24:12,308
I'd use the chain, if I were you.

293
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:14,852
All right. Come on out.
Open the door.

294
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,011
Stay away from here.

295
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,055
If you don't have the money,
don't show us your face over here!

296
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:41,101
Goddamn it!

297
00:24:48,443 --> 00:24:51,342
- Get out!
- Watch the money! Give me that!

298
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:07,554
Mom. Mom.

299
00:26:12,483 --> 00:26:14,381
You really think we'll find it today?

300
00:26:14,484 --> 00:26:17,918
It's a big city, Josh.
I bet there's a million Zoltar machines.

301
00:26:18,019 --> 00:26:20,145
Well, where should we start first?

302
00:26:20,255 --> 00:26:24,087
I don't know.
Oh, let... Let's try the next street.

303
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:29,151
- I told you, it's not a video game.
- Then what is it?

304
00:26:29,261 --> 00:26:32,558
Well, it's not a video game.

305
00:26:32,662 --> 00:26:34,855
This one's got a number on it.
Does yours?

306
00:26:34,963 --> 00:26:38,453
- No. Wait. Here's one.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

307
00:26:38,566 --> 00:26:40,624
- What are you doing?
- Do you have Zoltar?

308
00:26:40,734 --> 00:26:43,634
No, I told you, I looked in the back.
I've got Powerhouse...

309
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:46,135
- We really need Zoltar.
- I haven't got it.

310
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:50,696
- What did the guy at the arcade say?
- They have to license them.

311
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:54,366
- And where are we?
- Uh, the licensing bureau.

312
00:26:54,477 --> 00:26:58,069
Right. So all we gotta do is get a list
of all the carnivals then track it down.

313
00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:00,077
Will you quit your moping now?

314
00:27:00,179 --> 00:27:02,078
- I'm not mopin'.
- Can I help you?

315
00:27:02,181 --> 00:27:04,581
Yes. We would like a list
of all carnivals and fairs.

316
00:27:04,606 --> 00:27:05,807
And arcades.

317
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:09,343
- Yeah.
- Carnivals and fairs.

318
00:27:09,452 --> 00:27:12,482
Try Consumer Affairs
down the hall, room 111.

319
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:13,708
Thank you.

320
00:27:13,788 --> 00:27:16,949
Fill this out in triplicate.
Five dollar filing charge.

321
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:21,424
- See?
- One month to process. You get it in six weeks.

322
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:28,329
- Six weeks?
- Sometimes longer, but you could get lucky.

323
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,260
Next, please!

324
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:33,657
Fill this out in triplicate.

325
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:38,764
I'm gonna be 30 years old
for the rest of my life.

326
00:27:38,871 --> 00:27:42,600
Would you come on?
We'll figure something out.

327
00:27:42,706 --> 00:27:47,800
By the way, you may be
older than that.

328
00:27:47,911 --> 00:27:49,968
So now what?

329
00:27:50,078 --> 00:27:53,171
- I'll come and see you every day after school.
- How?

330
00:27:53,281 --> 00:27:55,771
I'll tell them I made
the basketball team.

331
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,178
- I won't have nothin' to do.
- You can get a job.

332
00:27:58,284 --> 00:27:59,779
- Can't get a job.
- Why?

333
00:27:59,804 --> 00:28:01,004
Can't be any different than school.

334
00:28:01,085 --> 00:28:03,279
- What are you good at?
- I don't know. Making spitballs?

335
00:28:03,388 --> 00:28:06,150
- How 'bout a delivery man?
- I don't know how to drive.

336
00:28:06,255 --> 00:28:08,279
Yeah, right.

337
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:13,387
Cardiological technician.
Civil engineer.

338
00:28:13,493 --> 00:28:16,461
- You're not gonna eat your cherry?
- Go ahead.

339
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:20,858
- Clerical transcriber.
- Billy.

340
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,626
Yeah.

341
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:29,859
- Gross. God, that's gross!
- Check, please.

342
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:32,961
- Go to the next column.
- Collection agent. Company clerk.

343
00:28:33,072 --> 00:28:36,699
- Computer operator. Construction engineer.
- Computer operator?

344
00:28:36,808 --> 00:28:39,401
- What?
- Computer operator. Read that one.

345
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:42,841
- Josh, will you quit with your stupid computers!
- Just read it.

346
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:46,880
- "MacMillan Toys." Toys!
- Toys!

347
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:47,743
Whee-whee-whee-whee, Jags.

348
00:28:49,183 --> 00:28:54,550
"Seeking experienced computer operators
for all levels of system management.

349
00:28:54,653 --> 00:28:57,450
"Candidates must perform data updates,
malfunction isolation...

350
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,885
- monitoring of cluster performance."
- "Performance." I can do that.

351
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:02,822
- You can?
- Sure.

352
00:29:02,925 --> 00:29:06,882
- Hey, great. They use H.P. 3000s.
- You understand all that?

353
00:29:06,994 --> 00:29:10,156
Well, it's... It's an old system,
but, you know...

354
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:16,698
- Where do we go?
- Um, "Apply in person, MacMillan Toys."

355
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:21,929
- All right. Let's go.
- Miss? Miss?

356
00:29:22,037 --> 00:29:24,527
Miss?

357
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,105
Miss?

358
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:29,173
You look good.

359
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,209
- MacMillan Toys!
- There it is!

360
00:29:35,814 --> 00:29:38,576
MacMillan Toys. May I help you?

361
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,944
- I'll connect you.
- Are these the applications?

362
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:43,915
- Yes. Just have a seat. I'll call your name.
- What's next?

363
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:47,543
- There.
- Previous employment.

364
00:29:47,654 --> 00:29:51,321
- Your paper route.
- I don't think I can put that.

365
00:29:51,322 --> 00:29:54,313
- Neighborhood circulation director?
- Yeah!

366
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,153
Yes. Hold on just a moment, please.

367
00:29:57,259 --> 00:30:00,455
What's he got?

368
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:05,660
Hey, don't worry about it.

369
00:30:05,765 --> 00:30:08,061
Um, social security number?

370
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,726
32-17-25.

371
00:30:10,835 --> 00:30:14,291
- What is that?
- It's my locker combination.

372
00:30:14,404 --> 00:30:18,065
- Great.
- Mr. Baskin?

373
00:30:18,173 --> 00:30:21,663
- Mr. Baskin?
- Y... Yes. Yes.

374
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:24,868
The personnel director
will see you now.

375
00:30:26,578 --> 00:30:29,307
Uh, your son can wait out here.

376
00:30:32,782 --> 00:30:34,907
Yeah, okay.
Son, you should sit down.

377
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:38,781
- And don't give the lady any trouble now.
- Sure, Dad.

378
00:30:38,886 --> 00:30:41,581
This way.

379
00:30:41,688 --> 00:30:44,781
Don't forget-
look him in the eye!

380
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,523
There's a couple of numbers
missing on your social security.

381
00:30:58,631 --> 00:31:00,655
Oh. Oh, 12.

382
00:31:02,401 --> 00:31:04,425
012.

383
00:31:07,638 --> 00:31:09,936
It says here you've
got four years' experience.

384
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:11,140
Yes.

385
00:31:11,141 --> 00:31:13,869
- All on computers.
- Yes.

386
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:20,943
Where did you go to school?

387
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,139
It was... It was called
George Washington.

388
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:27,444
Oh, G.W. My brother-in-law
got his doctorate there.

389
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:33,347
- Did you pledge?
- Yes, every morning.

390
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:39,450
It happened again.
David, the girl is absolutely useless.

391
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:42,957
You have got to give me someone who
knows what she is doing. Excuse me.

392
00:31:43,061 --> 00:31:45,722
I'm not getting any of my mail.
Nothing has been filed.

393
00:31:45,829 --> 00:31:48,956
Ever since she got engaged,
my life has been a disaster.

394
00:31:49,065 --> 00:31:51,156
Well, you know, she came
so highly recommended.

395
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:55,291
She spent the last three months writing
down her married name. Mrs. Judy Hicks.

396
00:31:55,401 --> 00:31:57,868
Mrs. Donald Hicks.
Mrs. Judy Mitchellson Hicks.

397
00:31:57,971 --> 00:32:00,564
Sometimes with a hyphen,
sometimes without a hyphen.

398
00:32:00,672 --> 00:32:04,127
Sometimes she spells the hyphen.

399
00:32:04,242 --> 00:32:06,941
Well, I really don't
know where I can put her.

400
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,167
Put her on unemployment.

401
00:32:11,578 --> 00:32:14,875
- When can you start?
- Soon.

402
00:32:22,012 --> 00:32:24,206
MacMillan Toys. I'll transfer.

403
00:32:24,314 --> 00:32:26,212
- Brent.
- Susan.

404
00:32:27,949 --> 00:32:29,915
- Where's Mildred?
- She's out sick.

405
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:33,451
Again.

406
00:32:33,553 --> 00:32:35,850
And it's easy to clean.

407
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,614
That's very important,
that you're easy to clean.

408
00:32:38,724 --> 00:32:40,622
Open that one.

409
00:32:43,193 --> 00:32:45,091
What's so...
What's the joke?

410
00:32:45,194 --> 00:32:48,185
- Is it a small?
- Oh, Miss Lawrence.

411
00:32:48,296 --> 00:32:50,195
See, when she opens
her shower presents...

412
00:32:50,298 --> 00:32:53,628
everything she says she'll say on her
wedding night, only she doesn't know it.

413
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:56,291
- So, when we read the list to her...
- Who's answering my phone?

414
00:32:56,401 --> 00:32:58,595
Oh, it's pink.

415
00:32:58,703 --> 00:33:00,635
Oh. I'll get it.

416
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:03,227
Oh, I needed towels.
Thank you very much.

417
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:10,471
Paul Davenport's office.

418
00:33:10,577 --> 00:33:12,634
- Can I help you?
- Susan Lawrence. Is he in?

419
00:33:12,745 --> 00:33:15,178
- Of course.
- Thank you.

420
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:20,815
- Susan.
- Paul.

421
00:33:20,918 --> 00:33:22,941
If I don't have a man tonight,
I'm absolutely going...

422
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:25,348
- Mr. MacMillan's on line two.
- Yeah, I'll hold.

423
00:33:25,454 --> 00:33:27,977
An automatic switch-on...

424
00:33:42,298 --> 00:33:45,061
These are the preliminary
voice runs on Princess Gwendolyn.

425
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:48,396
All comments should be directed
to Jack Taylor no later than Thursday.

426
00:33:49,602 --> 00:33:51,501
One day, I'll find my prince.

427
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:53,627
Alternate version number one:

428
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:55,432
One day, my prince will come.

429
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:57,528
Alternate version number two:

430
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:00,699
I want you to steal all
the money from Mummy's purse...

431
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:03,174
and buy all my accessories.

432
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:05,267
The more you buy me,
the more I'll love you.

433
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:09,506
Just kidding, Susan.

434
00:34:15,085 --> 00:34:16,983
Tra-la. Tra-la.

435
00:34:27,494 --> 00:34:30,893
I thought we'd start you off
on last week's preschool orders.

436
00:34:30,995 --> 00:34:34,588
It should take a few days. Give you
a chance to find your way around.

437
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:37,393
- Do you smoke?
- Well, just that once, but...

438
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,160
Only on breaks,
and in the coffee room.

439
00:34:40,268 --> 00:34:42,326
Most of that's pretty
straightforward stuff.

440
00:34:42,436 --> 00:34:45,336
You have any questions,
come to me. Good luck.

441
00:34:49,107 --> 00:34:51,164
Bye.

442
00:35:02,982 --> 00:35:06,279
The Dinky Link.

443
00:35:06,385 --> 00:35:08,614
Seven.

444
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:12,278
- Jimmy's Toy Box.
- Psst.

445
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:15,413
Screwy Hermie.

446
00:35:15,523 --> 00:35:17,717
Psst!

447
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:20,918
Hey. Psst. Hey.
I'm Scott Brennen.

448
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:23,995
Uh, I... I'm Josh Baskin.

449
00:35:24,096 --> 00:35:26,790
Listen, what are you trying to do,
get us all fired?

450
00:35:26,897 --> 00:35:29,057
- Huh?
- Gotta slow down. Pace yourself.

451
00:35:29,166 --> 00:35:31,998
- Slowly. Slowly. Slow.
- Sorry.

452
00:35:33,535 --> 00:35:36,900
- Today's my first day.
- I know.

453
00:35:40,507 --> 00:35:43,168
- So, how long have you worked here?
- Five years.

454
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:48,173
Work stinks,
but the fringe benefits are great.

455
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:52,438
See that girl over there in the red?

456
00:35:52,547 --> 00:35:55,606
Say hi to her, and she's yours.

457
00:35:55,716 --> 00:36:00,481
She'll wrap her legs around you so
tight, you'll be begging for mercy.

458
00:36:00,585 --> 00:36:03,246
Well, I'll stay away from her then.

459
00:36:04,588 --> 00:36:07,715
Excuse me.

460
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:12,250
Yeah. Brennen.
I gave it to you yesterday.

461
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,418
Oh, here it is.

462
00:36:14,528 --> 00:36:18,155
I don't have time to xerox it.
Let the new guy do it.

463
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:20,388
Yeah. It...

464
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:25,531
We still... We haven't
shipped it out yet.

465
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:27,625
You gotta be quiet.
People are tryin' to work here.

466
00:36:27,737 --> 00:36:29,636
- Hey, wait!
- They can't think.

467
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:32,331
We're gonna go in the other
room and see some toys. Come on.

468
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,736
Come on, you guys. Stay together.

469
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:39,401
Come on, guys.

470
00:36:40,512 --> 00:36:42,569
Trouble.

471
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:46,079
We're pregnant?

472
00:36:46,181 --> 00:36:48,614
Huggy Bear took a nosedive.

473
00:36:48,717 --> 00:36:50,615
That's not possible.

474
00:36:50,717 --> 00:36:55,015
Look at these figures, Paul.
Third-quarter profits off 40%.

475
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:57,179
Pre-orders down 55.

476
00:36:57,288 --> 00:37:01,416
I'm not talking about one toy.
I'm talking about the whole goddamn line:

477
00:37:01,525 --> 00:37:03,583
Huggy Bear Mama, Huggy Bear Papa.

478
00:37:03,693 --> 00:37:05,591
Goddamn Baby's off 60%.

479
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:09,955
You must feel awful.

480
00:37:12,332 --> 00:37:16,460
- I must feel awful?
- You must.

481
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,534
Paul, uh...

482
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:22,502
Paul, I... I think we must feel awful.

483
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,629
Well, yeah. I feel bad too.

484
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:27,229
This whole line was your idea.

485
00:37:27,342 --> 00:37:30,242
I think that if you just march
right in and talk with MacMillan...

486
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:32,105
It's not my fault.

487
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:35,236
Honey, are we trying to fix this
thing or are we tryin' to place blame?

488
00:37:35,347 --> 00:37:39,441
If it'll make you feel better, I'll go
in there with you while you talk to him.

489
00:37:40,684 --> 00:37:43,311
Thank you.

490
00:37:43,419 --> 00:37:48,116
Yeah.

491
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:51,655
I taught him everything he knows.

492
00:37:51,757 --> 00:37:55,691
Mm-hmm.
Right up.

493
00:37:55,793 --> 00:37:57,692
Hi, this is Matthew
with MacMillan Toys.

494
00:37:57,795 --> 00:38:00,160
Yeah, well, I live right
over by the river.

495
00:38:00,263 --> 00:38:02,195
And I just need
to confirm your address.

496
00:38:02,297 --> 00:38:04,696
You ever seen Brooklyn by dawn?

497
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,528
Hey, hey. Does it sound
like I'm beggin'? I am.

498
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:15,231
Hello?

499
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:17,396
Uh...

500
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:21,806
- Hello?
- Hello.

501
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:24,434
- Mrs. Baskin?
- Yes?

502
00:38:26,113 --> 00:38:28,774
- How are you?
- Who is this?

503
00:38:30,482 --> 00:38:33,177
I just wanted you to know that, uh...

504
00:38:33,284 --> 00:38:36,047
Josh is all right,
and he's okay and everything.

505
00:38:36,152 --> 00:38:38,209
You have my boy?

506
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,220
Yeah, and y... you're gonna get
him back just the way he was.

507
00:38:41,322 --> 00:38:44,017
Look, I swear to God,
if you do anything to him...

508
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:47,024
if you touch one hair on his head...

509
00:38:47,127 --> 00:38:50,323
I will spend the rest of my life
making sure you suffer.

510
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:54,525
Wow. Thanks.

511
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,386
Let me talk to Josh.

512
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:58,112
Oh, he can't come to
the phone right now.

513
00:38:58,201 --> 00:39:00,531
Why not? Why not?
What did you do to him?

514
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:03,329
I didn't do anything to him.
I think he's a terrific kid.

515
00:39:03,437 --> 00:39:06,234
I want proof that he's all right.

516
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:08,396
Uh, all right.

517
00:39:08,506 --> 00:39:13,169
Um, a... ask me something th...
that... that only he would know.

518
00:39:13,276 --> 00:39:16,402
Then I'll ask him for you, and
that way you'll know that he's okay.

519
00:39:16,511 --> 00:39:19,638
Ask him what I used to sing to him
when he was a little boy.

520
00:39:22,949 --> 00:39:25,547
Isn't there something else
that you'd rather ask him?

521
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:26,772
Ask him.

522
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:36,117
I got it. I got it.

523
00:40:00,172 --> 00:40:02,921
Look, you're gonna
see him again really soon.

524
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,497
I promise. I cross my heart
and hope to...

525
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:09,317
Uh, we'll talk about this later.

526
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:13,956
- That's total bullshit, Paul!
- But, sir, the favorability rating...

527
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:17,852
Let's not lie to ourselves.
If a kid likes a toy, it sells. That's all.

528
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:20,285
But every bit of research
and focus testing shows...

529
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:23,552
It worked in research.
It worked in the testing.

530
00:40:23,577 --> 00:40:24,776
It just didn't work with the kids.

531
00:40:24,853 --> 00:40:25,884
Oh, sorry.

532
00:40:25,909 --> 00:40:27,708
Why don't you watch where
the hell you're going!

533
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,542
- Are you okay?
- I am fine.

534
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:32,380
You could kill somebody
running around here like that!

535
00:40:32,483 --> 00:40:35,276
Paul, a boss should get knocked
on his ass once in a while.

536
00:40:35,382 --> 00:40:37,005
- It's good for him.
- I don't know, sir.

537
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,014
You should see a doctor.

538
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:39,741
For crying out loud, Paul,
I'm fine! I'm fine!

539
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:41,710
- Sorry, sir. Sorry.
- Where were you going anyway, son?

540
00:40:41,711 --> 00:40:43,267
- Sorry, sir. Sorry.
- Where were you going anyway, son?

541
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:45,866
Um, I was, uh...

542
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:49,135
I was going to the Xerox room
'cause they needed these by 5:00.

543
00:40:49,243 --> 00:40:53,104
Oh! That's good.
Nothing wrong with a little hustle.

544
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,966
Nothing at all.

545
00:40:56,072 --> 00:40:58,367
Right, Paul?

546
00:40:58,472 --> 00:41:00,732
It's good to see
a little hustle for a change.

547
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,961
What did he mean?

548
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:07,500
I hustle.
Uh, sir? Sir!

549
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:37,222
Get down!
Get down! Get out of the area!

550
00:41:41,163 --> 00:41:43,922
He's got my money. Get in!

551
00:41:46,361 --> 00:41:48,621
- Ferris!
- Thank you.

552
00:41:48,726 --> 00:41:51,282
Brennen!

553
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:54,049
Baskin!

554
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:56,213
- What is this?
- Payday.

555
00:41:56,323 --> 00:42:00,253
- Hey, Walt. Where's mine?
- $187?

556
00:42:00,355 --> 00:42:02,411
- Yep.
- Oh! Oh!

557
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,042
They really screw you, don't they?

558
00:42:05,153 --> 00:42:08,241
- "Sign below." Hi.
- Hi.

559
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:17,943
Okay. So how
would you like that?

560
00:42:20,047 --> 00:42:23,408
Could I have your
driver's license, please?

561
00:42:27,876 --> 00:42:31,204
- Okay.
- All right.

562
00:42:31,309 --> 00:42:32,773
Three dimes,
a hundred dollar bill and 87 ones.

563
00:42:43,256 --> 00:42:45,153
- One...
- One, two...

564
00:42:45,256 --> 00:42:48,186
three, four, five, six...
Three, four, five, six...

565
00:42:48,287 --> 00:42:51,307
- seven, eight, nine, 10!
- Seven, eight, nine...

566
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:55,416
Look at it. Look at it.
It's beautiful.

567
00:42:55,517 --> 00:42:57,811
Look at this. You know what
we're gonna do with this?

568
00:42:57,916 --> 00:42:59,904
- What?
- Spend it!

569
00:43:22,572 --> 00:43:25,093
It wasn't that bad.

570
00:43:25,204 --> 00:43:27,465
It was the boat ride that did it.

571
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:29,727
No. It was the pork rinds.

572
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:33,424
Pork rinds!

573
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,754
- We sure had fun, didn't we?
- Yeah. Yeah, we sure did.

574
00:43:42,863 --> 00:43:44,164
Booger! Booger!

575
00:43:44,165 --> 00:43:45,789
Booger! Booger!

576
00:43:45,897 --> 00:43:49,918
Get that baby to shut up. Come on.

577
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:51,995
I could use some help
with the baby.

578
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:57,649
Oh, please. I'm... I give you all the
help I can. I... You drive me nuts.

579
00:43:57,759 --> 00:43:59,656
You are never here.

580
00:43:59,758 --> 00:44:03,280
I'm just goin' out for a little
while. I'll be back when I want to, okay?

581
00:44:10,188 --> 00:44:12,981
- Hello?
- Hello.

582
00:44:13,086 --> 00:44:16,607
- Uh, is this the Baskin residence?
- Yes.

583
00:44:16,717 --> 00:44:18,875
- Hi.
- Who's this?

584
00:44:18,983 --> 00:44:21,379
We're conducting a, uh...

585
00:44:21,483 --> 00:44:23,380
a consumer s... survey
and we were wondering...

586
00:44:23,482 --> 00:44:28,503
what kind of medicine...
you would give to your family.

587
00:44:28,613 --> 00:44:31,735
- For what?
- For a stomachache.

588
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:34,208
Pepto-Bismol.

589
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:37,104
- How-How often do you give that?
- Every four hours.

590
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:39,106
I gotta go.

591
00:44:39,208 --> 00:44:41,105
Every four hours.

592
00:44:42,474 --> 00:44:45,132
Okay.

593
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,136
Thank you.

594
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:11,988
Josh! Josh!

595
00:45:12,094 --> 00:45:14,286
- Doggie!
- No-No. Get away from that dog.

596
00:45:14,393 --> 00:45:16,755
- Come on. Get away from that dog.
- Doggie. I wanna pet him!

597
00:45:16,858 --> 00:45:19,822
- Doggie!
- We'll go inside and buy you a nice gum ball.

598
00:45:19,924 --> 00:45:21,821
Okay.

599
00:45:26,188 --> 00:45:29,845
How did you get it to stop?

600
00:45:50,511 --> 00:45:54,134
Right. Okay.
Second door. Right there.

601
00:45:54,243 --> 00:45:58,606
Okay. This one is goin'
way out. See if you can get this one.

602
00:45:59,907 --> 00:46:02,202
Okay. Another big one.

603
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,132
Hey, no fair! Hey.

604
00:46:13,634 --> 00:46:15,394
Yee-haw!

605
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:18,328
Oh, my God.
Just keep away from the strange man.

606
00:46:20,597 --> 00:46:22,858
- Gotcha.
- What's your name?

607
00:46:22,963 --> 00:46:25,223
- Jordan. What's yours?
- My name's Josh.

608
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:28,225
- I'm gonna blow you away, Josh.
- I just got you!

609
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:30,848
- No way! You're closer. Get back here!
- I got you!

610
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:46,150
You big gawk.

611
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,006
- You work for me, don't you?
- Yes.

612
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:07,667
I thought so.
What, are you here with your kids?

613
00:47:07,777 --> 00:47:09,833
No.

614
00:47:11,476 --> 00:47:13,532
- I got the last!
- Did not.

615
00:47:13,642 --> 00:47:16,662
- I was just looking around.
- Oh.

616
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:21,161
Me too. I come here
every Saturday.

617
00:47:22,805 --> 00:47:25,701
You can't see this
on a marketing report.

618
00:47:27,402 --> 00:47:29,492
What's a marketing report?

619
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:32,122
Come on! It's my turn!

620
00:47:32,233 --> 00:47:35,197
Exactly. Come on.

621
00:47:38,097 --> 00:47:40,289
What do you think of that?

622
00:47:40,396 --> 00:47:42,452
- The Championship Hockey?
- Yeah.

623
00:47:42,563 --> 00:47:46,617
- Oh, I love it. Only that-
- Only what?

624
00:47:46,727 --> 00:47:49,987
- Well, the pieces don't move.
- What do you mean?

625
00:47:50,093 --> 00:47:53,579
Well, on the old set, you could slide
the men up and down the ice.

626
00:47:53,691 --> 00:47:55,917
Now all they do is spin around.

627
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:59,146
It's more like real hockey the old way.
Why'd they change it?

628
00:47:59,255 --> 00:48:01,345
I don't know.

629
00:48:01,455 --> 00:48:04,612
See, the Starfighters are good
because you can change all the pieces.

630
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:06,980
But I never liked the Galacticons.

631
00:48:07,086 --> 00:48:10,174
You only get one robot,
and they don't come with a vehicle.

632
00:48:10,283 --> 00:48:12,941
- I see.
- Plus, you can't take 'em underwater. If you do...

633
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:20,735
Neat.

634
00:48:31,741 --> 00:48:34,399
Okay, uh, let's check out the...

635
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:49,060
- Piano lessons?
- Three years.

636
00:48:49,167 --> 00:48:53,062
Me too. Every day after school.

637
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:18,211
Hey, hey!

638
00:50:16,297 --> 00:50:17,954
What department did
you say you were in?

639
00:50:17,979 --> 00:50:18,961
I'm in Computers.

640
00:50:18,962 --> 00:50:21,018
- Computers?
- Yeah. Yeah.

641
00:50:21,128 --> 00:50:24,114
You just saved me
a trip to the gym, son.

642
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:30,854
According to the studies, this thing
should go straight through the roof.

643
00:50:30,956 --> 00:50:33,183
- Hey! Hey! Watch it, fella.
- Sorry. Sorry.

644
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:37,083
Vice president
in charge of product development.

645
00:50:37,187 --> 00:50:39,448
Vice president?
He's only been here a week!

646
00:50:39,553 --> 00:50:41,949
And he came from Data Processing.

647
00:50:42,051 --> 00:50:45,913
He's out of his mind.
The old man has finally lost it.

648
00:50:46,017 --> 00:50:49,674
- Did you know he gave him Bob's old office?
- Bob's...

649
00:50:49,782 --> 00:50:52,769
Bob's office is bigger than my office!

650
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:54,135
There's gotta be a reason.

651
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,358
Things like this don't happen
unless there's a reason.

652
00:50:56,945 --> 00:50:59,410
That means if the president dies,
you get to take over?

653
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:01,532
No. They got a hundred of' em.
Are we ready?

654
00:51:01,557 --> 00:51:02,642
Yes, Mr. Baskin.

655
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,733
Come on in.

656
00:51:04,842 --> 00:51:07,863
Look at this place.
It's bigger than the principal's office!

657
00:51:07,975 --> 00:51:10,768
- How would you know?
- Remember that explosion in science?

658
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:13,030
- Oh, yeah.
- Truckapillar!

659
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:15,694
59.95.

660
00:51:15,804 --> 00:51:19,564
- You know that only costs 10 bucks to make?
- Get outta here!

661
00:51:22,968 --> 00:51:26,199
- What is this?
- Oh. They just put this in here.

662
00:51:26,224 --> 00:51:27,423
It doesn't mean anything.

663
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:30,860
So, what do they make you do
for all this?

664
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:35,327
Well, I play with all of this stuff, and
then I go in and tell 'em what I think.

665
00:51:35,429 --> 00:51:37,758
- That's it?
- Yeah.

666
00:51:37,861 --> 00:51:40,325
- And they pay you for that?
- Yeah.

667
00:51:40,427 --> 00:51:43,822
Suckers!

668
00:51:43,925 --> 00:51:46,322
Thank you, Miss Patterson.

669
00:51:46,425 --> 00:51:49,320
Hey, Miss Patterson, could you
call Media and have them send up...

670
00:51:49,423 --> 00:51:51,749
the video of the Giants
Broncos Super Bowl and

671
00:51:51,774 --> 00:51:53,971
have them edit out the
commercials and stuff?

672
00:51:54,154 --> 00:51:56,312
- Yes, Mr. Baskin.
- Thanks.

673
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,146
- Miss Patterson.
- You're the luckiest guy I know.

674
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:05,850
Boom!

675
00:52:05,953 --> 00:52:09,075
- Great.
- Mr. Davenport.

676
00:52:10,883 --> 00:52:13,144
Try taking some of the padding out.

677
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:16,477
Projected sales are
gonna go through the roof.

678
00:52:16,502 --> 00:52:17,580
Those test scores...

679
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:18,514
Whoa!

680
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:20,937
Oh... You know, this is an
office, not a playground.

681
00:52:21,112 --> 00:52:23,008
Kill somebody...

682
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:26,738
- Did you check Mattel?
- Nothing.

683
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:29,434
Time now to check the day's business news.

684
00:52:29,542 --> 00:52:31,631
- Coleco?
- Zero.

685
00:52:31,741 --> 00:52:35,137
He can't come from nowhere, Susan.
He has to come from somewhere.

686
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:36,899
- How 'bout Hasbro?
- Yes.

687
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:38,422
And Fisher-Price and Worlds of Wonder.

688
00:52:38,505 --> 00:52:40,803
I have called everywhere.
Nobody's ever heard of him.

689
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:42,426
This is just terrific!

690
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:44,298
- It's not my fault.
- Shh!

691
00:52:44,403 --> 00:52:46,864
Today's arrests
bring the current total to 18...

692
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:48,088
I know him.

693
00:52:48,268 --> 00:52:51,390
Those under indictment include
five senior vice presidents...

694
00:52:51,499 --> 00:52:53,226
Now they're arresting businessmen?

695
00:52:53,251 --> 00:52:55,249
The new American crime,
tryin' to earn a living?

696
00:52:55,331 --> 00:52:58,523
...the most coveted position on Wall Street-
Baskin!

697
00:52:58,629 --> 00:53:01,356
Susan, he has to come from somewhere.

698
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:05,516
Let's face it, Paul. The guy
comes from Data Processing.

699
00:53:05,626 --> 00:53:08,454
Terrific. That's just terrific.
This is just terrific!

700
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:10,285
You're being paranoid, Paul.

701
00:53:10,824 --> 00:53:14,380
These tests were conducted
over a six-month period...

702
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:20,419
using a double-blind format of eight
overlapping demographic groups.

703
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:23,541
Every region of the country
was sampled.

704
00:53:23,653 --> 00:53:26,742
The focus testing
showed a solid base...

705
00:53:28,649 --> 00:53:31,738
in the nine-to-11-year-old bracket...

706
00:53:31,848 --> 00:53:36,141
with a possible carryover
into the 12-year-olds.

707
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:42,335
When you consider that GoBots and
Transformers pull 37% market share...

708
00:53:42,444 --> 00:53:44,409
I'm sorry.

709
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:46,531
And that we are targeting
the same area...

710
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:49,198
I think that we should see
one-quarter of that...

711
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:53,327
and that is one-fifth of the total
revenue from all of last year.

712
00:53:56,071 --> 00:53:58,468
- Excellent, Paul.
- Thank you. Thank you.

713
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,796
Any questions?

714
00:54:00,902 --> 00:54:03,060
- No.
- Not from me.

715
00:54:03,168 --> 00:54:06,563
Yes?

716
00:54:06,666 --> 00:54:10,323
- Yes?
- I don't get it.

717
00:54:13,097 --> 00:54:15,561
What, exactly, don't you get?

718
00:54:15,662 --> 00:54:19,649
It turns from a building
into a robot. Right?

719
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:21,988
Precisely.

720
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,614
Well, what's fun about that?

721
00:54:27,957 --> 00:54:30,978
Well, if you had read
your industry breakdown...

722
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:34,780
you would see that our success
in the action figure area...

723
00:54:34,888 --> 00:54:38,648
has climbed from 27% to 45%
in the last two years.

724
00:54:38,753 --> 00:54:40,842
There. That might help.

725
00:54:40,952 --> 00:54:44,041
Oh.

726
00:54:48,282 --> 00:54:51,541
- Yes?
- I... I still don't get it.

727
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,937
What?

728
00:54:55,045 --> 00:54:57,377
What don't you get, Josh?

729
00:54:57,402 --> 00:55:00,399
There's a million robots
that turn into something.

730
00:55:00,478 --> 00:55:02,872
This is a building
that turns into a robot.

731
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:05,194
What's fun about
playing with a building?

732
00:55:05,274 --> 00:55:07,364
This is a skyscraper.

733
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:13,426
Well, couldn't it be, like, a robot that
turns into, like, a bug or something?

734
00:55:13,538 --> 00:55:15,695
- A bug?
- Yeah.

735
00:55:15,803 --> 00:55:19,031
A prehistoric insect with
claws that could pick up a car.

736
00:55:19,056 --> 00:55:20,254
Interesting.

737
00:55:21,134 --> 00:55:24,155
- A prehistoric Transformer?
- Interesting.

738
00:55:24,266 --> 00:55:27,424
- So the robot turns into a bug?
- Uh, gentlemen...

739
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,792
You've got a very good idea here!

740
00:55:29,897 --> 00:55:32,294
The robot turns into a bug!

741
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,486
- This is a great idea!
- Wh...

742
00:55:34,595 --> 00:55:37,151
- Different sizes...
- Susan, we could do ladybugs!

743
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,216
You could have
him wreck buildings.

744
00:55:39,241 --> 00:55:40,425
Transformers for girls!

745
00:55:40,426 --> 00:55:43,821
A building is inert. A bug, it moves,
it's got all kinds of possibilities.

746
00:55:43,925 --> 00:55:47,480
This doesn't just happen.
This guy... This doesn't happen.

747
00:55:47,589 --> 00:55:51,576
- He doesn't just come to a meeting and say "bugs."
- Uh...

748
00:55:51,688 --> 00:55:54,743
Well done, Josh. Well done.

749
00:55:58,884 --> 00:56:01,076
Oh-ho! He is vicious!

750
00:56:01,184 --> 00:56:04,807
- He's not vicious.
- Don't kid yourself. That man is a killer.

751
00:56:04,916 --> 00:56:07,312
All he said was, he didn't get it.

752
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:11,469
"I don't get it.
I don't get it. Let's make it a bug!"

753
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,907
He was going for the throat,
trying to eviscerate me.

754
00:56:15,011 --> 00:56:18,668
Did you see the look
on MacMillan's face?

755
00:56:20,077 --> 00:56:22,473
Mm-hmm.

756
00:56:22,575 --> 00:56:24,767
It's quite a unique space.

757
00:56:24,873 --> 00:56:28,928
The lines are so clean, and you don't
get any of that partition quality.

758
00:56:29,038 --> 00:56:32,468
It has 50-foot ceilings,
old hardwood floors...

759
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:35,830
ample closet space,
a modern kitchen...

760
00:56:35,936 --> 00:56:40,797
a brand-new bathroom
with a jet-stream Jacuzzi.

761
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:43,331
We'll take it!

762
00:56:48,396 --> 00:56:50,657
Baskin!
Rental delivery!

763
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:55,190
Come out.
Come out.

764
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:03,646
- Hey! What, are you nuts?
- So close.

765
00:57:08,422 --> 00:57:11,148
They said...

766
00:57:11,254 --> 00:57:13,650
that I could write you...

767
00:57:13,752 --> 00:57:17,114
and let you know I was okay.

768
00:57:17,218 --> 00:57:19,409
Whoa!
Check it out!

769
00:57:19,517 --> 00:57:24,209
So far they're treating me fine.

770
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,802
- I got enough to eat-
- Two!

771
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:29,537
And am perfectly safe.

772
00:57:30,578 --> 00:57:36,066
- Rebound! Two!
- They say I'll get out of here...

773
00:57:38,175 --> 00:57:40,968
In about a month.

774
00:57:45,738 --> 00:57:47,635
In the meantime...

775
00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:53,096
it's a lot like camp.

776
00:57:54,035 --> 00:57:56,364
I watch TV...

777
00:57:56,468 --> 00:57:59,556
- I got it! I got it! I got it!
- Hooray!

778
00:57:59,666 --> 00:58:04,562
And even get outside...

779
00:58:04,665 --> 00:58:06,926
once in a while.

780
00:58:07,031 --> 00:58:09,552
I know...

781
00:58:09,663 --> 00:58:12,093
you miss me...

782
00:58:12,194 --> 00:58:14,953
but try not to worry.

783
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,786
I think...

784
00:58:16,892 --> 00:58:18,584
this experience...

785
00:58:18,692 --> 00:58:21,622
- might even be good for me.
- Knocked him out!

786
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:26,550
I love you very much...

787
00:58:26,656 --> 00:58:28,882
and I know...

788
00:58:28,987 --> 00:58:32,417
I'll see you soon.

789
00:58:32,518 --> 00:58:35,539
Your son...

790
00:58:35,651 --> 00:58:38,672
Joshua.

791
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:41,373
P.S.

792
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:44,570
Give Rachel a kiss
from her big brother.

793
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:52,479
- Hey.
- Oh, hey. Hey.

794
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:55,207
Sorry I'm late. The computers
were down for, like, 45 minutes.

795
00:58:55,315 --> 00:58:57,212
There was nothing I could do about it.

796
00:58:57,314 --> 00:58:59,211
- What is this?
- It's a letter to my mom.

797
00:58:59,314 --> 00:59:01,471
- She's gonna feel... This is terrible!
- No. You don't mail it...

798
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:03,771
- You're gonna get her all screamin' and cryin'-
- No, I'm not.

799
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:06,037
It's just a letter
to say I'm okay and stuff.

800
00:59:09,176 --> 00:59:11,038
Come on. Why can't I go with you?

801
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:14,627
Bill... I told you, Billy. It's only for
people in the company, so you can't.

802
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:18,171
- I could be your assistant.
- Billy!

803
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:21,725
Fine. Fine.
Just go to your fancy party...

804
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:26,234
while I stay at home by my mailbox
and wait for your stupid carnival list.

805
00:59:26,336 --> 00:59:30,027
- It's just this once, okay?
- Sure.

806
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:33,098
Yes. That's a beautiful fit.

807
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,425
Here, Paul. Take this,
go over to the mirror...

808
00:59:35,532 --> 00:59:37,588
put the hat on and look at yourself.

809
00:59:38,864 --> 00:59:40,761
What color would you call this?

810
00:59:40,863 --> 00:59:44,157
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. I'd like to rent a tuxedo.

811
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:47,486
Uh, I see. Is... Is... Is there
any particular occasion?

812
00:59:47,593 --> 00:59:49,717
Yeah. His company is havin' a party.

813
00:59:49,825 --> 00:59:52,381
Uh, well, then you probably
want something simple.

814
00:59:52,491 --> 00:59:56,357
Maybe a nice black, uh,
with a p-p-p...

815
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:58,518
Whoa! Check it out.

816
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,493
- Oh, wow. Feel that. What do you think?
- I like it.

817
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:03,530
Look at these.

818
01:00:03,631 --> 01:00:06,723
Uh, usually this type of tuxedo
is popular with students...

819
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:09,595
senior proms, juvenile
dress-ups and maybe a fancy p...

820
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:10,820
Look at this one.

821
01:00:11,103 --> 01:00:14,002
- Ooh.
- What kind of tuxedo is this?

822
01:00:14,105 --> 01:00:16,629
That's not a tuxedo!
That's a morning coat.

823
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,730
- Well, what do you call this?
- Ugly.

824
01:00:19,775 --> 01:00:22,208
Oh, hey. I've got it.

825
01:00:23,410 --> 01:00:26,536
Excuse me. I'll be right back. Oy.

826
01:00:29,815 --> 01:00:34,341
Maybe we got off
on the wrong foot. Let's start again.

827
01:00:34,451 --> 01:00:36,384
Hey, smell my neck.

828
01:00:36,485 --> 01:00:38,577
Mm-mmm.

829
01:00:38,687 --> 01:00:41,586
- I was hopin' for a raise, sir.
- A raise.

830
01:00:41,689 --> 01:00:43,918
- Just-Just-Just a little one.
- All right, a little one.

831
01:00:44,024 --> 01:00:46,218
Uh, have a good time.
I'll see what I can do.

832
01:00:46,325 --> 01:00:49,554
- Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir.
- All right.

833
01:00:49,661 --> 01:00:52,753
Come on, George. You can't sell
to the parents. You sell to the kids.

834
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,762
I disagree.

835
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:57,265
Listen. You hit 'em at
7:00 in the morning

836
01:00:57,290 --> 01:00:59,290
while their folks are still asleep.

837
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:01,630
Then you get 'em good and
jacked up for three hours...

838
01:01:01,735 --> 01:01:04,497
so that by 10:00,
they're rippin' the house apart.

839
01:01:04,603 --> 01:01:07,729
It's timing, George. Timing.

840
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:10,670
You want that parent to wake up...

841
01:01:10,774 --> 01:01:15,334
listening to little Jennifer
screaming, "Puppy Pal, Puppy Pal."

842
01:01:17,479 --> 01:01:19,938
It's very beautiful and
I'm having a lovely time.

843
01:01:19,963 --> 01:01:21,563
I'm delighted, Miss Patterson.

844
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:25,980
It's much better than last year.
I just wanted to tell you that.

845
01:01:26,084 --> 01:01:28,313
How are you gents doing here?

846
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:32,114
- Double up on the scotch, will you?
- Right away, sir.

847
01:01:35,723 --> 01:01:37,622
Here you are, sir.

848
01:01:37,724 --> 01:01:40,385
- Susan.
- Love your tux.

849
01:01:40,493 --> 01:01:44,018
I think it's the same as the ma?
Tre d's.

850
01:01:46,263 --> 01:01:50,789
Yeah. Have you decided what
you're doing on the Danbury line?

851
01:01:50,900 --> 01:01:53,060
No, I haven't.

852
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:56,558
Well, uh, I think if you got
everyone's input up front...

853
01:01:56,759 --> 01:01:59,351
I mean, right from
the beginning, you can...

854
01:01:59,461 --> 01:02:02,053
- Susan, have a drink.
- What?

855
01:02:02,163 --> 01:02:06,290
Have a couple of drinks.
It's a party.

856
01:02:16,571 --> 01:02:19,834
Look at this!

857
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,209
Oh, God!

858
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:41,012
Josh! I'm glad
you could make it.

859
01:02:41,121 --> 01:02:43,485
Bet he gets another raise.

860
01:02:43,589 --> 01:02:46,181
Now, that's what I call a tuxedo.

861
01:02:46,291 --> 01:02:50,349
I rented it. This is a real bow tie though.
I tied it myself.

862
01:02:50,461 --> 01:02:53,690
- That's why I was late.
- No, you're not late at all.

863
01:02:53,796 --> 01:02:56,120
- Let me show you around.
- There's Miss Patterson. Hi.

864
01:02:56,145 --> 01:02:57,745
There's a guy from the meeting!

865
01:02:58,699 --> 01:03:02,134
Would you like a drink... uh,
champagne, glass of wine?

866
01:03:02,159 --> 01:03:03,559
No, just some milk.

867
01:03:04,236 --> 01:03:06,293
Why not? You on the wagon?

868
01:03:06,405 --> 01:03:08,394
No, I'm at a party.

869
01:03:14,576 --> 01:03:16,508
It works on your hips.

870
01:03:16,611 --> 01:03:19,100
You need a whole other exercise
for your thighs. It's true.

871
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,338
Hi.

872
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:41,785
Let me grab a plate here.

873
01:03:41,895 --> 01:03:45,260
Excuse me. This looks good.

874
01:03:45,364 --> 01:03:48,854
...from the I.R.S. Tells me that I can't
amortize like that...

875
01:03:48,967 --> 01:03:51,297
s... so I show him the schedule...

876
01:03:51,401 --> 01:03:54,300
and then he says, "It's not
accepted accounting procedure."

877
01:03:54,402 --> 01:03:56,368
I say, "You little pissant."

878
01:03:56,470 --> 01:03:59,164
Try a little bit of, uh...

879
01:04:02,675 --> 01:04:04,868
- That looks good.
- Yeah.

880
01:04:07,812 --> 01:04:10,472
Want to get a load of that guy.
He's, uh, overdressed.

881
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:19,274
- Look, my feet really hurt.
- Yeah? You want me to rub 'em?

882
01:04:19,386 --> 01:04:21,545
You know, most people,
they don't know how to rub feet.

883
01:04:21,654 --> 01:04:23,916
Think it's in the thumbs.
It's the knuckles.

884
01:04:24,023 --> 01:04:27,457
- Now put some eucalyptus oil on-
- Just-Just dance.

885
01:04:29,026 --> 01:04:30,958
- It's great.
- Oh, it's great.

886
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:33,891
- I'm having a really good time.
- I'm really excited about this.

887
01:04:38,065 --> 01:04:39,963
- Ignore him. Just ignore him.
- I don't know him.

888
01:04:40,066 --> 01:04:43,158
- The guy's a goddamn knock-off artist.
- What do you mean?

889
01:04:43,269 --> 01:04:47,498
Amphibian?
He takes 10,000 G.I. Joes...

890
01:04:47,605 --> 01:04:52,972
slaps some gills on 'em, webs
their feet, packages 'em in seaweed.

891
01:04:53,074 --> 01:04:57,371
- There's not supposed to be pieces in mousse.
- Carrot.

892
01:05:27,598 --> 01:05:30,224
- But the toy sold, Paul.
- Excuse me.

893
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:36,594
- Hi.
- Hi.

894
01:05:36,704 --> 01:05:40,228
All the same people
having all the same discussion.

895
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,864
It's like they cloned
some party in 1983...

896
01:05:43,976 --> 01:05:47,704
and kept spinning it out
again and again and again.

897
01:05:47,812 --> 01:05:50,243
I loved your ideas
on the Squeezy Doll line.

898
01:05:51,380 --> 01:05:53,278
Thanks.

899
01:05:53,381 --> 01:05:56,473
They were so... incisive.

900
01:05:56,583 --> 01:05:59,243
"Incisive."

901
01:06:00,486 --> 01:06:02,884
It's beluga.

902
01:06:02,987 --> 01:06:05,385
MacMillan orders it every year.

903
01:06:07,224 --> 01:06:10,521
Sidle up to him
and then ask for a raise.

904
01:06:20,432 --> 01:06:22,625
Gesundheit.

905
01:06:22,734 --> 01:06:24,962
You all right?

906
01:06:25,069 --> 01:06:27,297
You okay?

907
01:06:27,403 --> 01:06:29,801
You want a glass of water?

908
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,204
- Want something to drink?
- Could I have a milk shake or something?

909
01:06:35,309 --> 01:06:38,299
I got a car outside.
You wanna get outta here?

910
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,242
- Uh-huh.
- Let's go.

911
01:06:45,616 --> 01:06:47,673
Watch it!

912
01:06:47,784 --> 01:06:51,683
Did you see that?

913
01:06:51,820 --> 01:06:54,810
I'm not really a big one for parties.

914
01:06:54,922 --> 01:06:58,753
I like things that are
a little more... intimate.

915
01:06:58,858 --> 01:07:01,017
Wow! Is this your car?

916
01:07:01,126 --> 01:07:03,649
Well, it's the company's car.

917
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:07,251
- This is the coolest thing I've ever seen!
- Yes, sir.

918
01:07:10,131 --> 01:07:12,393
Sir.

919
01:07:22,874 --> 01:07:25,272
Just seeing someone in the office...

920
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:28,400
you don't really get
a chance to know them.

921
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,534
Just being with you here,
I really get a sense of...

922
01:07:31,646 --> 01:07:33,839
Of who you are.

923
01:07:33,948 --> 01:07:36,005
- You gonna eat these fries?
- No, no.

924
01:07:36,116 --> 01:07:38,172
Hey, mister, you want
some of these fries?

925
01:07:38,197 --> 01:07:39,597
No. No, thank you.

926
01:07:39,685 --> 01:07:43,413
See, it's hard,
in a business situation...

927
01:07:45,221 --> 01:07:49,052
I mean, there's this invisible
line, and... and even if...

928
01:07:49,157 --> 01:07:52,352
even if you're attracted to someone...

929
01:07:52,460 --> 01:07:55,222
You're gonna call someone before...

930
01:07:55,328 --> 01:07:57,760
No.

931
01:07:57,864 --> 01:08:01,524
Uh, I mean,
at this point in my life...

932
01:08:01,634 --> 01:08:04,192
Don't...

933
01:08:04,302 --> 01:08:08,201
Don't play with the ra...
Leave the, uh... Don't...

934
01:08:08,304 --> 01:08:11,635
I'm really vulnerable
right now, you know, and I...

935
01:08:18,077 --> 01:08:20,270
- And I...
- Ejector seat!

936
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:29,381
This is great!

937
01:08:31,853 --> 01:08:34,911
Hey, come on up.

938
01:08:45,828 --> 01:08:48,727
- That was my apartment.
- Really?

939
01:08:48,830 --> 01:08:51,262
- Yeah.
- Love to see where you live.

940
01:08:59,405 --> 01:09:02,099
Have you always lived alone?

941
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:04,832
- No, not always.
- Oh.

942
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:07,965
Is it just recently, or...

943
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:12,408
- Yeah.
- Give yourself a couple of days. It'll pass.

944
01:09:12,513 --> 01:09:15,947
Oh. They said it was
gonna take six weeks.

945
01:09:16,049 --> 01:09:19,016
Well, it can be painful, but...

946
01:09:19,118 --> 01:09:22,142
that's what they invented
Xanax for, right?

947
01:09:22,254 --> 01:09:24,345
Watch your step.

948
01:09:24,454 --> 01:09:26,716
Thank you.

949
01:09:29,058 --> 01:09:32,253
I'm not sure we should do this yet.

950
01:09:32,360 --> 01:09:35,657
- Do what?
- Well...

951
01:09:35,762 --> 01:09:41,664
I mean, I like you, and I...
I wanna spend the night with you.

952
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,396
Do you mean sleep over?

953
01:09:48,937 --> 01:09:51,563
Well, is... Yeah.

954
01:09:54,641 --> 01:09:57,767
Okay. But I get to be on top.

955
01:10:15,089 --> 01:10:18,022
- You live here?
- Yeah.

956
01:10:18,124 --> 01:10:19,987
It's nice, isn't it?

957
01:10:26,995 --> 01:10:30,894
- You, uh... You want a soda?
- Huh?

958
01:10:30,998 --> 01:10:34,897
- Soda? You want one?
- Yeah, sure.

959
01:10:35,001 --> 01:10:39,196
I rigged this up
so you don't need any quarters.

960
01:10:39,305 --> 01:10:42,329
- Aah! No. No. Don't.
- What?

961
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:45,031
The glue is not dry yet.

962
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:47,369
- Sorry. It's okay.
- Sorry.

963
01:10:47,476 --> 01:10:49,806
You didn't break it.

964
01:10:53,013 --> 01:10:53,937
No.

965
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:56,062
You don't need quarters
for this either. It's free.

966
01:10:56,149 --> 01:10:59,605
- No, thank you.
- Okay.

967
01:11:02,119 --> 01:11:05,813
- Is that a trampoline?
- Yeah. You wanna try it?

968
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:10,150
- No.
- You should. It's really fun.

969
01:11:10,258 --> 01:11:14,055
It's simple too. Come on. You'll
like it. And it's really easy too.

970
01:11:14,161 --> 01:11:16,855
- Do you have some wine, maybe...
- Take off your shoes.

971
01:11:16,963 --> 01:11:19,156
Oh, maybe for a few minutes.

972
01:11:19,263 --> 01:11:21,729
It's easy. All right.

973
01:11:24,701 --> 01:11:27,998
It's really simple.
Let me just get my big balls off here.

974
01:11:30,304 --> 01:11:33,930
- No, really, I... I'll watch.
- It's fun. I'll do it with you.

975
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,939
Up.
Excellent. All right.

976
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,099
- Help me up?
- Sure!

977
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:46,877
- Okay. Jump.
- You want me to jump.

978
01:11:46,983 --> 01:11:49,279
Yeah. Just jump.

979
01:11:51,018 --> 01:11:54,042
- There. Now can I have a drink?
- No, no, no.

980
01:11:54,154 --> 01:11:58,679
Look, really jump.
Stand there and get air. Go ahead.

981
01:11:58,790 --> 01:12:02,951
Get some air between you
and the tramp... oline.

982
01:12:05,294 --> 01:12:08,852
Oh, come on. I'll do it with you,
to show you how it goes.

983
01:12:08,963 --> 01:12:12,021
Ready? Come on. Jump.
See? That's all it is.

984
01:12:12,132 --> 01:12:15,122
That's all there is to it.
Good.

985
01:12:16,469 --> 01:12:19,527
There you go.
There you go. Yeah.

986
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:25,465
It's easy.
Anybody could do this.

987
01:12:25,575 --> 01:12:27,598
Whoo!

988
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:37,679
Whoa! How'd you do that?

989
01:12:42,876 --> 01:12:45,104
Good!

990
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:54,781
- Why do you smoke?
- Oh.

991
01:12:57,185 --> 01:12:59,117
- That's, uh...
- That was two.

992
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:02,210
- Mmm, yeah.
- Okay.

993
01:13:48,386 --> 01:13:50,579
Oh. Hi.

994
01:13:50,687 --> 01:13:52,744
- Here.
- What?

995
01:13:52,856 --> 01:13:55,015
Pick one.

996
01:13:58,191 --> 01:14:01,022
Okay, try it again.

997
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:04,759
That one.

998
01:14:04,863 --> 01:14:08,421
It's for you.
It's a glow-in-the-dark compass ring.

999
01:14:08,532 --> 01:14:10,760
So you won't get lost.

1000
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:34,045
Good night.

1001
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:55,118
Jones Industrial Average...

1002
01:14:55,226 --> 01:14:57,385
Have fun last night?

1003
01:14:57,494 --> 01:14:59,619
Sure. Yeah.

1004
01:14:59,729 --> 01:15:02,457
Yeah. Yeah, you left pretty quick.

1005
01:15:02,564 --> 01:15:04,792
Gave him a ride home, Paul.

1006
01:15:04,899 --> 01:15:07,923
- Oh. Did he enjoy it?
- Don't be ridiculous.

1007
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:10,399
Ah, that's me... Mr. Ridiculous.

1008
01:15:10,504 --> 01:15:12,697
Just a silly old guy.

1009
01:15:12,805 --> 01:15:16,261
Short-term credit
conditions. Yields fell slightly...

1010
01:15:16,373 --> 01:15:18,931
I don't feel like going out tonight.

1011
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:23,100
- What do you mean? They're your friends.
- I know.

1012
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:26,871
Leave it! Leave it!

1013
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,140
Do you have to play with everything?

1014
01:15:41,824 --> 01:15:44,620
Baskin.

1015
01:15:44,726 --> 01:15:47,522
Baskin?

1016
01:15:52,898 --> 01:15:56,297
Wouldn't you rather play basketball?
I know how to play that.

1017
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,992
- We could be a team for the MacMillan Company.
- No!

1018
01:15:59,102 --> 01:16:01,360
I'm not very good at sports,
but I'll give it a try.

1019
01:16:02,771 --> 01:16:05,670
- That isn't a sport.
- Well, it takes eye-to-hand coordination.

1020
01:16:05,773 --> 01:16:08,797
- It's not a sport if you don't sweat.
- What about golf?

1021
01:16:08,909 --> 01:16:11,933
And you're not sitting there
letting some machine do all the work.

1022
01:16:12,043 --> 01:16:14,407
- What about car racing?
- Shut up, Baskin!

1023
01:16:14,511 --> 01:16:16,943
- What are the rules again?
- I told you.

1024
01:16:17,047 --> 01:16:21,947
Over the line on the serve. Yellow
is out-of-bounds. Play to 21. Ready?

1025
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:24,812
- Sorry. Sorry.
- One-nothin;

1026
01:16:24,919 --> 01:16:28,477
- Hold it.
- Get it! Get it! Get it! Attaboy.

1027
01:16:28,588 --> 01:16:31,350
- Okay. You ready? All right.
- Yeah.

1028
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:35,447
- Ho ho! Nice try!
- That was in.

1029
01:16:35,559 --> 01:16:40,084
Two-zip. Just made it two-zip.
Ready? Okay, here we go.

1030
01:16:46,934 --> 01:16:49,799
Oh! It's in. Good. Point.

1031
01:16:49,902 --> 01:16:52,630
Whoa!
What's the matter...

1032
01:16:52,736 --> 01:16:54,759
Wait a minute.
Time out. Time!

1033
01:16:59,209 --> 01:17:01,141
- Backhand!
- Whoa!

1034
01:17:01,243 --> 01:17:03,937
Yes!

1035
01:17:05,947 --> 01:17:09,108
- 19-18.
- Uh, that was under the line.

1036
01:17:09,216 --> 01:17:10,313
What?

1037
01:17:10,338 --> 01:17:11,738
You said it had to be
over the line on a serve.

1038
01:17:11,763 --> 01:17:12,816
My best sport's video hockey.

1039
01:17:12,817 --> 01:17:13,909
No, I didn't.

1040
01:17:13,934 --> 01:17:16,234
Yeah, you said it had to be
over the line on a serve.

1041
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:19,651
No, I did not!
Now, give me the goddamn ball!

1042
01:17:19,755 --> 01:17:21,880
Well, that's cheating.

1043
01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:24,183
- Give me the goddamn ball, will ya?
- No!

1044
01:17:24,292 --> 01:17:27,054
- Give me the ball, you little shit.
- It's my serve.

1045
01:17:27,161 --> 01:17:31,185
- Give me the goddamn ball! I never said that!
- Yes, you did.

1046
01:17:33,131 --> 01:17:35,654
Give me the...
Give me the ball.

1047
01:17:35,765 --> 01:17:38,323
Give me the ball!

1048
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:41,333
- Give me the... Give me the...
- This is new.

1049
01:17:41,437 --> 01:17:45,302
Come here. Give me the ball.

1050
01:17:45,405 --> 01:17:47,871
- You're a cheater!
- Give me the...

1051
01:17:47,975 --> 01:17:50,066
- I do not cheat!
- He cheats!

1052
01:17:50,175 --> 01:17:52,300
Give me the ball!

1053
01:17:52,409 --> 01:17:54,534
Give me the ball!

1054
01:17:56,746 --> 01:18:00,736
Give... Give me the...
Give me the...

1055
01:18:00,849 --> 01:18:02,276
Give me the ball!

1056
01:18:02,301 --> 01:18:04,501
All right, let's take it over.
We'll take it over! Ow!

1057
01:18:07,954 --> 01:18:10,147
He didn't have to punch me.

1058
01:18:10,255 --> 01:18:12,585
I know.

1059
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:15,714
He's scared of you. Ohh.

1060
01:18:15,826 --> 01:18:18,957
- You don't play his game.
- I tried to play his game.

1061
01:18:18,982 --> 01:18:20,182
He beat me up.

1062
01:18:21,763 --> 01:18:25,197
If he's scared of me,
then why did he punch me?

1063
01:18:25,299 --> 01:18:29,824
He punched you
because he's scared of you.

1064
01:18:29,935 --> 01:18:33,061
- I don't get it.
- It's just the way he is.

1065
01:18:33,171 --> 01:18:35,694
Everything's a fight with him.

1066
01:18:35,805 --> 01:18:38,033
Everyone's an enemy.

1067
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:41,596
It's not just a job for him.
It's a war.

1068
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,845
How come you're so nice?

1069
01:18:50,949 --> 01:18:52,149
What?

1070
01:18:52,174 --> 01:18:55,374
You work as hard as he does,
and you're not like that.

1071
01:18:55,952 --> 01:18:58,111
You don't know me that well.

1072
01:18:58,221 --> 01:19:00,483
Yes, I do.

1073
01:19:02,324 --> 01:19:05,416
You're one of
the nicest people I've met.

1074
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:12,260
How do you do it?

1075
01:19:30,532 --> 01:19:33,328
On the fast break.
What a job. Let's get this done.

1076
01:19:33,434 --> 01:19:35,332
- It's in the corner-
- Oh. Go Knicks.

1077
01:19:35,435 --> 01:19:38,129
Oh! Heartbreak! He lost it.

1078
01:19:38,237 --> 01:19:43,638
Must need a new center.
Good night.

1079
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:11,388
Come in.

1080
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:16,656
- Hey, Josh.
- Hi.

1081
01:20:16,762 --> 01:20:19,593
What time is it?

1082
01:20:19,698 --> 01:20:22,290
- It's 10:00 or somethin'.
- Mmm.

1083
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:25,561
What are you doin' here so late?

1084
01:20:25,668 --> 01:20:28,066
I finished up on the Astro Blaster.

1085
01:20:29,638 --> 01:20:32,230
So? What do you think?

1086
01:20:33,407 --> 01:20:35,464
It's okay.

1087
01:20:37,643 --> 01:20:40,201
I know what you mean.

1088
01:20:40,312 --> 01:20:44,973
Astro Blaster, Laser Might-
They're all the goddamn same.

1089
01:20:46,849 --> 01:20:49,083
Wasn't always that way.

1090
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:56,235
I remember there was this duck once.

1091
01:20:56,348 --> 01:20:58,617
You mean, like,
a-a rubber duck for the bath?

1092
01:20:58,723 --> 01:21:01,927
No, no, no. Just a...

1093
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:06,104
little, wooden, quacky duck.

1094
01:21:06,215 --> 01:21:11,597
And a string on the bottom and you pulled
him forward, he'd waddle from side to side.

1095
01:21:11,701 --> 01:21:13,764
And I realized...

1096
01:21:15,281 --> 01:21:20,389
if you put the head on a hinge,
just a little wooden dowel...

1097
01:21:21,937 --> 01:21:27,216
then the beak would peck at the ground
when it pulls forward.

1098
01:21:27,321 --> 01:21:31,060
See? Oh.

1099
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:35,671
Just... I had an idea.

1100
01:21:38,460 --> 01:21:40,591
Look at this. Come over here.

1101
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:44,878
You know what this is?

1102
01:21:44,981 --> 01:21:47,617
It's a report on how to
expand the heavy adventure

1103
01:21:47,642 --> 01:21:49,648
market past the 12
year-old cutoff point.

1104
01:21:50,735 --> 01:21:53,905
- You can't do that. It doesn't work.
- Why not?

1105
01:21:54,013 --> 01:21:56,316
Y... You can't keep a kid
from growing up.

1106
01:21:56,422 --> 01:22:01,165
All a 13-year-old boy wants
is a 13-year-old girl.

1107
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,141
And I sure don't know
how to build one of those.

1108
01:22:24,784 --> 01:22:27,314
- What's this?
- What does it look like?

1109
01:22:27,427 --> 01:22:31,165
Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties
and your exercise tape.

1110
01:22:31,274 --> 01:22:33,509
- Susan-
- And I want my keys back.

1111
01:22:35,657 --> 01:22:37,959
Sure.

1112
01:22:40,306 --> 01:22:43,908
It was just some scratches, honey.
He'll get over it.

1113
01:22:44,018 --> 01:22:46,719
- It has nothing to do with him.
- Oh, what is this, then?

1114
01:22:46,827 --> 01:22:48,992
Your one big moment of redemption?

1115
01:22:50,173 --> 01:22:52,110
Yeah. Yeah, that sounds good to me.

1116
01:22:52,212 --> 01:22:54,982
Come on, Susan. He's just
another link in the chain.

1117
01:22:55,089 --> 01:22:57,928
First it was Tom Caulfield.
Then Handlen.

1118
01:22:58,034 --> 01:23:01,533
Then Golding. Then me.
Am I missing somebody?

1119
01:23:01,646 --> 01:23:04,118
It's not like that anymore.

1120
01:23:04,221 --> 01:23:07,321
What is so special about Baskin?

1121
01:23:07,432 --> 01:23:10,498
He's a grown-up.

1122
01:23:10,609 --> 01:23:12,409
Susan...

1123
01:23:12,517 --> 01:23:15,320
I can't believe
you brought up Golding.

1124
01:23:16,630 --> 01:23:19,332
Can't believe you slept with him.

1125
01:23:26,330 --> 01:23:28,062
Oh!

1126
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:31,737
Catch.
Catch the dough. Catch!

1127
01:23:31,848 --> 01:23:34,151
A little piece of dough over there!

1128
01:23:34,256 --> 01:23:37,163
Here it come!
Throw me the dough. Right here.

1129
01:23:37,266 --> 01:23:38,930
Hey! Hey!

1130
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:41,137
- Oh, my God!
- Got him!

1131
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:47,731
He's really good!

1132
01:23:52,419 --> 01:23:54,357
Surprise!

1133
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:17,061
Happy birthday to you.

1134
01:24:17,171 --> 01:24:19,234
- You!
- Hey.

1135
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:21,544
What are you gonna wish for this time?

1136
01:24:28,810 --> 01:24:33,222
I know what we can do. We can get
some beers and some dirty magazines...

1137
01:24:33,327 --> 01:24:37,134
- I can't, Billy.
- What? Of course you can. It's your birthday.

1138
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,839
- I have to go somewhere.
- Where? Where?

1139
01:24:39,949 --> 01:24:42,422
Um...

1140
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:45,728
well, I have to
go meet somebody and...

1141
01:24:45,835 --> 01:24:51,217
- Slag out all night.
- Yeah, I know, but, see, I... I just...

1142
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:55,059
Well, I can't right now.
But I'll call you. All right?

1143
01:24:55,167 --> 01:24:57,435
Okay? I'll give you a call.

1144
01:24:59,147 --> 01:25:02,214
Thanks again, Billy! It was fun!

1145
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:11,378
- Hi.
- Hi.

1146
01:25:13,865 --> 01:25:16,498
- Do you want to come in?
- Sure.

1147
01:25:33,968 --> 01:25:36,236
Sit down.

1148
01:25:52,163 --> 01:25:54,226
- Wanna go?
- Yeah! Yeah.

1149
01:25:54,338 --> 01:25:56,675
Okay.

1150
01:26:22,931 --> 01:26:25,166
Wanna go again?

1151
01:26:29,723 --> 01:26:31,626
How come you have all these points?

1152
01:26:31,730 --> 01:26:33,895
'Cause I'm just tappin' 'em.
You don't have to kill 'em.

1153
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:44,771
Rick Rhoden, on the mound.

1154
01:26:47,149 --> 01:26:49,349
He takes the curve.

1155
01:26:49,457 --> 01:26:52,364
Here's the windup and the pitch.

1156
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:55,271
Pick a prize.

1157
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:58,351
So they have these cars
that you can actually drive...

1158
01:26:58,454 --> 01:27:02,022
except they're on this rail,
so you can't get off the road...

1159
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:03,602
You have a really big gob of mustard right...

1160
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,843
- What?
- Mustard.

1161
01:27:06,949 --> 01:27:09,320
- Where?
- Right there.

1162
01:27:13,539 --> 01:27:16,240
- Is it gone?
- Well...

1163
01:27:16,347 --> 01:27:18,376
Here.

1164
01:27:21,365 --> 01:27:24,204
- That gone?
- Yeah.

1165
01:27:29,226 --> 01:27:31,563
Listen.

1166
01:27:31,668 --> 01:27:34,004
Oh, the music?

1167
01:27:39,059 --> 01:27:41,190
Wanna dance?

1168
01:27:41,301 --> 01:27:43,466
Dance?

1169
01:27:43,576 --> 01:27:46,608
- We don't have to if you don't want to.
- Okay. Okay.

1170
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,954
- All right.
- Okay.

1171
01:27:50,666 --> 01:27:53,608
- Are you cold?
- Mm-mmm.

1172
01:27:55,582 --> 01:27:59,156
We could get some hot
chocolate, you know.

1173
01:27:59,181 --> 01:28:00,384
Mm-mmm.

1174
01:28:00,467 --> 01:28:02,529
You can wear my jacket if you want.

1175
01:28:02,641 --> 01:28:05,079
- Come on. It'll be fun.
- I'm scared.

1176
01:28:05,182 --> 01:28:08,049
What are you worried about?
You're with me, right?

1177
01:28:08,074 --> 01:28:09,778
All right.
You're on.

1178
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:31,001
Oh, I haven't done this
in a long time.

1179
01:28:39,501 --> 01:28:43,570
What were you like
when you were younger?

1180
01:28:45,487 --> 01:28:49,089
Oh, well, I wasn't much different.

1181
01:28:49,201 --> 01:28:51,834
I believe that about you.

1182
01:29:01,341 --> 01:29:04,875
I've been thinking about you a lot.

1183
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:08,894
It's crazy.

1184
01:29:11,879 --> 01:29:14,147
In my car...

1185
01:29:14,253 --> 01:29:16,886
lying in bed.

1186
01:29:20,139 --> 01:29:23,673
I've just never gone out
with someone like you.

1187
01:29:25,425 --> 01:29:29,061
With all the other men,
there was so much to hide.

1188
01:29:31,947 --> 01:29:35,253
I feel like I can tell you anything.

1189
01:29:38,336 --> 01:29:41,436
Susan? Susan?

1190
01:29:44,891 --> 01:29:48,026
There's something
I think I should tell you.

1191
01:29:48,136 --> 01:29:50,495
What?

1192
01:31:04,945 --> 01:31:07,202
You want the light on?

1193
01:31:54,665 --> 01:31:58,214
- Good morning. Hey, Brent! How are you?
- Good morning!

1194
01:31:58,325 --> 01:32:00,548
- Hi, everybody!
- Hi, Josh!

1195
01:32:00,655 --> 01:32:02,843
Josh. My man!

1196
01:32:02,952 --> 01:32:06,003
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1197
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:07,410
Good morning, sir.

1198
01:32:07,434 --> 01:32:09,629
I'd like some coffee,
please, Miss Patterson.

1199
01:32:10,106 --> 01:32:11,466
But you don't drink coffee.

1200
01:32:12,905 --> 01:32:16,127
And, uh, make it black.

1201
01:32:16,233 --> 01:32:18,127
It was a dream, honey.

1202
01:32:18,230 --> 01:32:22,381
Atlantic City was beautiful
and Donald was so romantic...

1203
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:26,437
I know I'm late with this,
but congratulations, Mrs. Hicks.

1204
01:32:28,679 --> 01:32:33,035
Barbara, you are not
going to believe this. Hold on.

1205
01:32:38,198 --> 01:32:42,247
You know, you two should come to
Vermont. It is so pretty up there now.

1206
01:32:42,359 --> 01:32:46,408
- We spent our anniversary there.
- All you did was watch TV.

1207
01:32:46,516 --> 01:32:50,997
- I popped popcorn too.
- He likes that intellectual stuff.

1208
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:54,501
Anybody happen to see that
great documentary about Columbus...

1209
01:32:54,604 --> 01:32:56,827
on PBS the other night?

1210
01:32:56,934 --> 01:32:59,054
- Mm-mmm.
- Uh, no. Was it good?

1211
01:32:59,165 --> 01:33:02,091
- I had no idea he had a fourth ship.
- Yeah. The Santa Cristina.

1212
01:33:02,193 --> 01:33:05,414
- That's right.
- He only had that on his second trip though.

1213
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,345
- You saw it too.
- No.

1214
01:33:08,448 --> 01:33:11,641
But I... I used to... study,
you know, the stuff, so...

1215
01:33:11,666 --> 01:33:12,863
Really?

1216
01:33:12,941 --> 01:33:17,161
- Dad, I need some help with my alge...
- Uh, not now, Adam.

1217
01:33:17,268 --> 01:33:20,353
- Yeah, Dad, you said...
- Adam, we have guests.

1218
01:33:20,463 --> 01:33:24,784
He's had the roughest time with algebra.
We've tried tutors, everything.

1219
01:33:24,888 --> 01:33:27,871
- Mom!
- With algebra? I used to study that too.

1220
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:30,001
Isn't that nice?

1221
01:33:30,114 --> 01:33:32,597
Okay, look.
Forget all the X's and Y's stuff...

1222
01:33:32,709 --> 01:33:34,761
"cause that was invented
by some teacher that hates kids.

1223
01:33:34,873 --> 01:33:36,767
- All right.
- Let's imagine that Larry Bird...

1224
01:33:36,870 --> 01:33:39,694
- is gonna score 10 points in a quarter, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

1225
01:33:39,798 --> 01:33:41,885
So how many points is he
gonna score in the entire game?

1226
01:33:41,910 --> 01:33:43,491
That's easy... 40 points.

1227
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:46,747
- Exactly. That's algebra.
- Righ... It is?

1228
01:33:46,853 --> 01:33:52,242
Yeah. See? Okay, one quarter is to 10
points that he scores in a quarter...

1229
01:33:52,345 --> 01:33:54,533
just as four...

1230
01:33:54,641 --> 01:33:56,829
You're right. He's wonderful.

1231
01:33:56,937 --> 01:33:59,295
- I know.
- Ohh!

1232
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:01,629
For earned run averages, field
goal percentages, whatever.

1233
01:34:01,654 --> 01:34:02,851
That's pretty cool.

1234
01:34:02,927 --> 01:34:05,910
I don't wanna hear it anymore.

1235
01:34:06,022 --> 01:34:08,881
- You constantly bring... What's home?
- This is my house.

1236
01:34:08,984 --> 01:34:11,968
What's home? Fine. It's your house,
you pay for it.

1237
01:34:17,470 --> 01:34:20,329
- Billy, are you on the phone?
- I'm doin' it.

1238
01:34:20,433 --> 01:34:23,689
- Hey, Billy, get off the phone.
- Listen to your mother.

1239
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,945
- Mmm.
- He's never done this before.

1240
01:34:27,055 --> 01:34:31,104
- Kind of like a sweepstakes.
- Get the art department on the phone. Get them!

1241
01:34:31,215 --> 01:34:34,832
- Send out for some sandwiches.
- Cajun or deli?

1242
01:34:34,942 --> 01:34:37,494
Maybe next year, right? Next year.

1243
01:34:37,605 --> 01:34:41,087
- You can do it. I know you can.
- I cannot plan a whole line.

1244
01:34:41,200 --> 01:34:44,716
Why? Nobody knows more about toys
in this entire company than you.

1245
01:34:44,827 --> 01:34:47,844
Susan, that means
marketing and strategy and stuff.

1246
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:50,245
- All he wants is a proposal.
- I can't...

1247
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:52,602
You come up with the ideas,
and I'll handle the marketing.

1248
01:34:52,627 --> 01:34:53,824
Excuse me.

1249
01:34:53,912 --> 01:34:56,532
- But it-
- Come on. It'll be neat.

1250
01:34:57,806 --> 01:34:59,791
Oh, I... I don't know.

1251
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:02,289
I don't have any ideas
for new toys or anything.

1252
01:35:02,314 --> 01:35:03,511
You've got great ideas.

1253
01:35:19,538 --> 01:35:21,431
Cute. Can you walk the dog?

1254
01:35:23,231 --> 01:35:26,849
- Forget how to knock?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1255
01:35:37,974 --> 01:35:42,091
Hey! Hey, you guys!
Wait up for me!

1256
01:35:53,482 --> 01:35:56,533
"Department of Consumer Affairs"?

1257
01:35:59,605 --> 01:36:01,862
Yeah, buddy! It came!

1258
01:36:01,969 --> 01:36:05,025
He gives too much homework.
What'd you get on the test?

1259
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:06,247
I got a "C."

1260
01:36:09,989 --> 01:36:13,040
- Do you have, like, Sports Illustrated?
- Sure.

1261
01:36:16,611 --> 01:36:20,434
- Here.
- Two and a quarter, kid.

1262
01:36:24,132 --> 01:36:28,181
- Hey. I got it.
- Oh, all right. Comic books.

1263
01:36:28,293 --> 01:36:31,548
- Change.
- Say, what's that one?

1264
01:36:31,654 --> 01:36:34,773
- Trade. Yeah.
- This one's got Billy in the coal mine.

1265
01:36:34,882 --> 01:36:37,139
Think I've read this one.

1266
01:36:37,245 --> 01:36:39,468
I'll trade you for X-Factor.

1267
01:36:41,338 --> 01:36:45,387
It won't be like these, where
you just follow the story along.

1268
01:36:45,498 --> 01:36:48,122
You would actually
make a whole different

1269
01:36:48,147 --> 01:36:50,741
story appear just by
pressing these buttons.

1270
01:36:50,823 --> 01:36:53,341
An electronic comic book?
That's amazing.

1271
01:36:53,452 --> 01:36:56,571
Yeah, a living comic book.
It's gonna be different every time.

1272
01:36:56,681 --> 01:36:59,006
This is incredible.
You're brilliant.

1273
01:36:59,109 --> 01:37:03,930
If you liked one, you could see it
over and over and over again.

1274
01:37:04,035 --> 01:37:06,689
You're... You're wonderful.

1275
01:37:06,797 --> 01:37:09,054
Do you really like it?

1276
01:37:10,758 --> 01:37:13,015
- Really?
- Really.

1277
01:37:15,617 --> 01:37:19,235
- You think Mac'll like it?
- I think he'll love it.

1278
01:37:19,342 --> 01:37:22,067
We could do sports
comic books, where, like,

1279
01:37:22,092 --> 01:37:24,287
if he's going to steal
second or something.

1280
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:28,717
We could have sports books...
baseball, football.

1281
01:37:28,829 --> 01:37:31,415
It would work for almost
any sport there is... hockey!

1282
01:37:31,524 --> 01:37:35,880
- Wh... What is it we're doing?
- Huh?

1283
01:37:38,845 --> 01:37:41,068
W-What's going on here?

1284
01:37:41,175 --> 01:37:43,795
Well, you know, we're...

1285
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,857
Something wrong?

1286
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:52,547
- You don't like it?
- No! No!

1287
01:37:52,657 --> 01:37:54,709
It's...

1288
01:37:56,383 --> 01:37:59,502
I mean, if it's an affair,
that's one thing.

1289
01:38:00,810 --> 01:38:03,362
But if it's...

1290
01:38:03,472 --> 01:38:06,194
If it's s... something else...

1291
01:38:08,930 --> 01:38:11,948
Not that we have to know
right now. We don't.

1292
01:38:12,058 --> 01:38:15,642
But if we think that it could
turn into something else, well...

1293
01:38:20,777 --> 01:38:23,034
How do you feel about all this?

1294
01:38:25,171 --> 01:38:27,462
How do I feel about what?

1295
01:38:29,830 --> 01:38:32,984
How do you...
How do you f... feel about me?

1296
01:38:48,666 --> 01:38:53,181
What is that supposed to mean?

1297
01:39:03,842 --> 01:39:06,667
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
Mr. Baskin is still in conference.

1298
01:39:06,771 --> 01:39:09,697
Yeah? Well, tell him I called again.

1299
01:39:09,799 --> 01:39:13,484
Kopecki. K-O-P...

1300
01:39:13,593 --> 01:39:15,986
E-K-E. Yes, I can spell, young man.

1301
01:39:16,088 --> 01:39:18,209
Yeah, right.
Well, tell him it's important.

1302
01:39:18,318 --> 01:39:20,143
Good-bye.

1303
01:39:20,248 --> 01:39:22,436
Each page would be
made out of six panels.

1304
01:39:22,545 --> 01:39:24,969
There will be 30 pages
per electronic comic book,

1305
01:39:24,994 --> 01:39:26,790
with a choice every two pages...

1306
01:39:27,371 --> 01:39:30,660
No, choice every three pages.

1307
01:39:30,765 --> 01:39:32,494
But ours will also be in color.
Did I say that?

1308
01:39:32,519 --> 01:39:33,716
Yes, Mr. Baskin.

1309
01:39:33,793 --> 01:39:35,715
Ours... Did I say...
I didn't say that right.

1310
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,436
Yes. Well, whatever. Anyway...

1311
01:39:40,016 --> 01:39:43,600
- Do you have the list of story line options?
- Maybe.

1312
01:39:43,710 --> 01:39:46,466
Can I see them?

1313
01:39:46,572 --> 01:39:48,499
Maybe.

1314
01:39:48,603 --> 01:39:50,531
- What was that? That sound.
- What? What?

1315
01:39:50,633 --> 01:39:52,685
That. What are you doing?

1316
01:39:52,796 --> 01:39:55,756
- What is it?
- Let me see your hand.

1317
01:39:55,858 --> 01:39:57,751
- Did you make this?
- No, Petey made it. Here.

1318
01:39:57,854 --> 01:39:59,674
- What does it do?
- Put your hand right there.

1319
01:39:59,699 --> 01:40:00,981
Just put your hand right there.

1320
01:40:00,982 --> 01:40:02,876
Put your hand. Okay. Watch.

1321
01:40:02,979 --> 01:40:04,907
- Put your hand on it.
- What does it do?

1322
01:40:05,010 --> 01:40:09,059
That's incredible.

1323
01:40:09,169 --> 01:40:11,256
That's great.

1324
01:40:14,128 --> 01:40:15,622
I don't get how it works.

1325
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:17,842
Well, you need another
person for it to work.

1326
01:40:18,022 --> 01:40:20,506
Although maybe
it will work with a dog. I don't know.

1327
01:40:22,148 --> 01:40:25,165
All right. Let's get back to work.

1328
01:40:25,277 --> 01:40:27,567
Do you want some coffee? Sure?

1329
01:40:27,673 --> 01:40:29,567
Uh-huh.

1330
01:40:44,180 --> 01:40:46,073
- Susan.
- Oh, hi.

1331
01:40:46,176 --> 01:40:50,198
- You working late again?
- Yeah. Well, we were just...

1332
01:40:50,311 --> 01:40:53,209
- I get... got some coffee.
- You know, you're looking good these days.

1333
01:40:53,310 --> 01:40:55,502
- No.
- Oh, yeah. You are.

1334
01:40:55,611 --> 01:40:58,168
- Oh.
- I'm happy for you.

1335
01:40:58,278 --> 01:41:01,902
- Oh.
- Happy for both of you. I really am.

1336
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:07,070
- Night.
- Night, darling;

1337
01:41:19,215 --> 01:41:22,873
It's your house?
The deed's in my name.

1338
01:41:22,983 --> 01:41:27,039
I don't care who you raised.
Did you raise gerbils and dogs?

1339
01:41:27,151 --> 01:41:29,479
My tone is plenty civil.

1340
01:41:29,584 --> 01:41:32,482
My tone is plenty civil.
Who's putting the food on your plate?

1341
01:41:32,584 --> 01:41:34,879
- It's my house.
- It's my house. I keep the house.

1342
01:41:34,985 --> 01:41:37,473
You keep sayin' that,
but the deed's in my name.

1343
01:41:39,085 --> 01:41:43,573
Well, Jenny was saying
that there was a problem...

1344
01:41:43,686 --> 01:41:45,674
Hi.

1345
01:41:48,020 --> 01:41:51,282
Well, Wednesday would be better
than Thursday.

1346
01:41:51,387 --> 01:41:52,820
Mr. Baskin can't be...

1347
01:41:52,845 --> 01:41:54,844
I have a key example right here.

1348
01:41:54,921 --> 01:41:58,409
Where you been?
I've been trying to reach you forever.

1349
01:41:58,522 --> 01:42:00,749
- I'm in the middle of something, okay?
- That's the list.

1350
01:42:00,855 --> 01:42:03,786
- All you gotta do is call.
- Can you give me a minute?

1351
01:42:03,889 --> 01:42:04,817
Yes.

1352
01:42:04,842 --> 01:42:07,141
What are you talking about?
This is it. This is the list.

1353
01:42:07,224 --> 01:42:10,015
Would you come back at lunch?
I'm busy right now... Hello?

1354
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:11,240
Busy?

1355
01:42:11,424 --> 01:42:14,048
- Billy!
- Are you outta your mind?

1356
01:42:14,157 --> 01:42:16,213
Jesus, Billy. Miss Patterson,
get them on the phone...

1357
01:42:16,325 --> 01:42:18,290
This is what we've been waiting for.

1358
01:42:18,391 --> 01:42:22,288
I got work to do. Can't you understand
that? I got a deadline to meet. God!

1359
01:42:24,193 --> 01:42:27,455
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Hey!

1360
01:42:27,561 --> 01:42:30,958
Hey, you're Josh Baskin! Remember?
You broke your arm on my roof!

1361
01:42:31,061 --> 01:42:34,220
You hid in my basement when Robert
Tyson was about to rip your head off!

1362
01:42:34,328 --> 01:42:37,226
You don't get it, do you?
This is important!

1363
01:42:40,362 --> 01:42:44,817
I'm your best friend.
What's more important than that, huh?

1364
01:42:46,763 --> 01:42:51,127
And I'm three months older
than you are, asshole.

1365
01:42:57,498 --> 01:43:00,895
Stupid stuff.

1366
01:43:00,999 --> 01:43:03,931
Some friend. I don't need him.

1367
01:43:07,566 --> 01:43:09,622
Stupid jacket.

1368
01:43:14,367 --> 01:43:17,663
Josh?

1369
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:22,761
Josh!

1370
01:43:26,403 --> 01:43:28,868
Oh. Hi, Mrs. Baskin.

1371
01:43:40,006 --> 01:43:42,233
Hiya.

1372
01:43:42,340 --> 01:43:45,032
I was just looking around in here.

1373
01:43:45,140 --> 01:43:47,469
Hmm.

1374
01:43:47,573 --> 01:43:50,800
- Your hair's getting longer.
- I got it cut yesterday.

1375
01:43:50,907 --> 01:43:52,963
Oh.

1376
01:43:55,975 --> 01:43:58,304
He had a birthday.

1377
01:43:58,409 --> 01:44:00,805
Yeah, I... I know.

1378
01:44:04,043 --> 01:44:06,940
I got him this anyway.

1379
01:44:21,512 --> 01:44:23,443
- Pete Rose.
- Yeah.

1380
01:44:23,547 --> 01:44:26,035
They have these special shops
where they do that.

1381
01:44:26,146 --> 01:44:30,975
You know, if you want,
you can keep it until... until he...

1382
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:34,777
He'll be coming back real soon.

1383
01:44:42,650 --> 01:44:46,047
Everything's gonna be okay.

1384
01:45:38,726 --> 01:45:43,248
"You are standing in the cavern
of the evil wizard.

1385
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,313
All around you are the carcasses
of slain ice dwarfs."

1386
01:45:51,128 --> 01:45:55,456
Melt wizard.

1387
01:45:55,561 --> 01:45:59,118
"What do you want to melt him with?"

1388
01:46:09,131 --> 01:46:11,687
Throw thermal pod.

1389
01:46:15,232 --> 01:46:17,492
- Race you to the corner!
- No!

1390
01:46:17,598 --> 01:46:19,654
Why not?

1391
01:46:19,765 --> 01:46:22,162
- You always win.
- I'll let you win.

1392
01:46:44,702 --> 01:46:46,667
Spreading leaves!

1393
01:46:48,570 --> 01:46:50,592
Greg! Time for dinner!

1394
01:46:50,704 --> 01:46:52,999
Wait! Just five
more minutes!

1395
01:46:53,105 --> 01:46:56,593
Mrs. Kaplan, in just
a little bit to your right.

1396
01:46:57,739 --> 01:46:59,795
Your right. Your right.

1397
01:46:59,905 --> 01:47:04,098
Mrs. Kaplan knows her right
and her left. Isn't that great?

1398
01:47:04,206 --> 01:47:07,639
Let's have some smiles.
This is a joyous occasion.

1399
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:09,830
No, no, no, just...

1400
01:47:16,308 --> 01:47:19,274
- Where are we going?
- Where do you guys wanna go?

1401
01:47:23,743 --> 01:47:26,765
Thanks, mister!

1402
01:47:28,276 --> 01:47:31,037
Got it. I got it. Got it.

1403
01:47:31,144 --> 01:47:34,234
- Hit a couple more!
- All right.

1404
01:48:02,949 --> 01:48:05,210
Where you been? It's kind of late.

1405
01:48:05,316 --> 01:48:08,577
Oh, I was... was out.

1406
01:48:08,683 --> 01:48:11,046
Out where?

1407
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:14,241
Just... took a walk.

1408
01:48:19,485 --> 01:48:21,712
Josh, what's wrong?

1409
01:48:26,919 --> 01:48:28,816
What is it?

1410
01:48:33,855 --> 01:48:35,617
I haven't told you something because

1411
01:48:35,642 --> 01:48:37,641
I didn't think that you
were gonna believe me.

1412
01:48:37,722 --> 01:48:39,652
And even if you did
believe me, I didn't think

1413
01:48:39,677 --> 01:48:41,576
that you were gonna
like me anymore, so...

1414
01:48:41,656 --> 01:48:44,315
Oh, honey, come here.
You can tell me anything.

1415
01:48:44,422 --> 01:48:46,887
What?

1416
01:48:51,724 --> 01:48:56,019
Susan, I'm not what you think I am.

1417
01:48:56,126 --> 01:48:58,852
Uh, what do you mean?

1418
01:49:00,592 --> 01:49:04,524
Before I met you,
I was in Little League.

1419
01:49:04,626 --> 01:49:08,251
Um, I was in Little League,
and I rode my bike to school...

1420
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:11,950
and I played with my friends
and hung out with them and...

1421
01:49:12,061 --> 01:49:15,924
What are you-
What are you talking about?

1422
01:49:16,029 --> 01:49:18,517
I want to go home.

1423
01:49:20,596 --> 01:49:24,028
I miss my family, Susan,
and I want to go home.

1424
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:26,924
- Oh, my God. You're married.
- No.

1425
01:49:27,030 --> 01:49:30,362
This was too good to be true.
There had to be something.

1426
01:49:30,387 --> 01:49:32,186
Susan, I'm not married.

1427
01:49:33,698 --> 01:49:35,788
- You're not?
- No.

1428
01:49:35,899 --> 01:49:39,921
- I'm a child.
- What?

1429
01:49:41,098 --> 01:49:43,120
I'm a child, Susan...

1430
01:49:43,233 --> 01:49:47,756
and I'm... I'm not ready
for all of this.

1431
01:49:47,867 --> 01:49:51,696
Oh, that's fine.
That is... That's just great.

1432
01:49:51,801 --> 01:49:54,294
- You see, what happened...
- No, I understand.

1433
01:49:54,319 --> 01:49:55,518
"I'm not ready to make a commitment.

1434
01:49:55,543 --> 01:49:57,400
I'm not ready to accept
the responsibility."

1435
01:49:57,401 --> 01:49:58,691
No, you don't understand.

1436
01:49:58,702 --> 01:50:01,599
- I'm 13 years old.
- Oh, and who isn't?

1437
01:50:01,702 --> 01:50:05,258
You think that there isn't a frightened kid
inside of me too?

1438
01:50:05,369 --> 01:50:08,460
No, I mean I really am 13.

1439
01:50:08,570 --> 01:50:10,696
I went to bed one
night and I was a kid,

1440
01:50:10,721 --> 01:50:12,720
woke up the next morning,
I was a grown-up.

1441
01:50:12,805 --> 01:50:15,631
Oh, right. And yesterday I
was a schoolgirl with pigtails.

1442
01:50:15,656 --> 01:50:17,455
Why are you doing this, Josh?

1443
01:50:18,039 --> 01:50:21,005
- There was this carnival in New Jersey.
- Please.

1444
01:50:21,105 --> 01:50:23,167
I made a wish on a machine
called the Zoltar machine.

1445
01:50:23,192 --> 01:50:24,392
Oh, stop it.

1446
01:50:24,473 --> 01:50:25,962
It was a Zoltar machine.

1447
01:50:25,987 --> 01:50:27,986
It had this bobbing head,
and it looked like a devil.

1448
01:50:28,074 --> 01:50:30,431
If you got a quarter
in the devil's mouth,

1449
01:50:30,456 --> 01:50:31,655
you could make a wish, and I did.

1450
01:50:31,741 --> 01:50:34,866
So I made a wish to be big.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1451
01:50:34,975 --> 01:50:37,496
I changed into a grown-up,
when I'm really just a kid.

1452
01:50:37,608 --> 01:50:40,267
Fine, Josh, you're a kid.

1453
01:50:42,376 --> 01:50:46,637
Look, I really don't know what it
is that you're trying to tell me...

1454
01:50:46,743 --> 01:50:50,140
but we have a very big presentation
to give tomorrow...

1455
01:50:50,244 --> 01:50:53,043
so I'm gonna get some sleep.

1456
01:52:21,432 --> 01:52:23,366
Hello?

1457
01:52:23,469 --> 01:52:26,267
Yeah, do you have a Zoltar machine?

1458
01:52:26,374 --> 01:52:29,776
- Nope. Never heard of it.
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

1459
01:52:40,932 --> 01:52:43,400
Wait. I need a paper.

1460
01:52:43,502 --> 01:52:45,402
Would you get me some gum?

1461
01:52:55,423 --> 01:52:57,083
Thank you.

1462
01:53:18,696 --> 01:53:22,058
These are the notes,
in case you want 'em.

1463
01:53:22,083 --> 01:53:23,285
Thank you.

1464
01:53:31,351 --> 01:53:34,287
Well, should get the cards set
up before everyone comes in.

1465
01:53:36,025 --> 01:53:37,925
Okay.

1466
01:53:48,246 --> 01:53:50,442
Hello?

1467
01:53:50,550 --> 01:53:52,950
- Yeah, do you have a Zoltar machine?
- Got one right here.

1468
01:53:53,053 --> 01:53:54,953
- You do?
- Yeah.

1469
01:53:55,057 --> 01:53:58,028
Yeah! Yeah, thanks. That's great!

1470
01:53:59,099 --> 01:54:01,090
Yeah!

1471
01:54:06,846 --> 01:54:10,749
MacMillan Toys. I'll transfer.

1472
01:54:31,419 --> 01:54:33,980
Right there.
Sea Point Park, New York.

1473
01:54:39,098 --> 01:54:41,533
Well?

1474
01:54:41,637 --> 01:54:44,402
Yes?

1475
01:54:44,509 --> 01:54:47,000
They're waiting for you, Mr. Baskin.

1476
01:54:54,725 --> 01:54:58,753
- Thanks.
- See you around.

1477
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:11,811
There's this flat screen on the inside
with, uh, with pictures on it...

1478
01:55:11,921 --> 01:55:15,619
and you read it, and you have to make a choice
of what the character's gonna do.

1479
01:55:15,728 --> 01:55:19,762
If he's gonna fight the dragon,
you push one of the buttons...

1480
01:55:19,787 --> 01:55:20,988
Uh...

1481
01:55:23,708 --> 01:55:27,270
- Paul?
- I don't get it.

1482
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:29,245
- Well...
- Paul, stop it.

1483
01:55:29,350 --> 01:55:31,318
It's a comic book that...

1484
01:55:31,421 --> 01:55:34,756
See, there's a computer chip inside
which stores the choices.

1485
01:55:34,861 --> 01:55:38,696
So, when you reach the end of the
page, you decide where the story goes.

1486
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:40,995
- That's the point.
- Terrific, Susan.

1487
01:55:41,104 --> 01:55:44,097
The kid makes his own decision.

1488
01:55:44,210 --> 01:55:46,701
- This is really possible?
- Yeah.

1489
01:55:46,813 --> 01:55:50,182
In fact, it's a very simple program.
Isn't that right?

1490
01:55:52,790 --> 01:55:56,159
So what happens
when you run out of choices?

1491
01:55:56,263 --> 01:55:59,666
That's the great thing.
You can just sell different adventures.

1492
01:55:59,769 --> 01:56:03,364
Just pop in a brand-new disk, and
you get a whole new set of options.

1493
01:56:03,476 --> 01:56:06,041
We could market this
on a comic book rack.

1494
01:56:06,066 --> 01:56:07,267
Mm-hmm.

1495
01:56:07,348 --> 01:56:11,547
- I'll be right back.:
- How much would the unit cost?

1496
01:56:12,925 --> 01:56:16,657
Our initial figure is around seven...

1497
01:56:18,801 --> 01:56:21,202
Around seven dollars...

1498
01:56:21,306 --> 01:56:27,111
with a retail cost of about $18.95.

1499
01:56:28,852 --> 01:56:32,379
You expect a kid to pay
$ 19 for a comic book?

1500
01:56:32,491 --> 01:56:34,823
I think a kid...

1501
01:56:40,572 --> 01:56:42,733
Will you excuse me?

1502
01:56:42,842 --> 01:56:46,711
- What's going on?
- Let 'em be.

1503
01:56:51,156 --> 01:56:53,317
Josh?

1504
01:56:53,426 --> 01:56:56,157
Josh?
Oh.

1505
01:57:09,755 --> 01:57:10,588
More.

1506
01:57:10,613 --> 01:57:12,215
Will you take me to
Sea Point Park, New York?

1507
01:57:12,293 --> 01:57:15,286
- Get in.
- Sea Point Park? Josh!

1508
01:57:15,398 --> 01:57:17,366
- Hey! Not so fast!
- Sorry. Here.

1509
01:57:17,467 --> 01:57:20,028
Josh! Josh!

1510
01:57:21,207 --> 01:57:23,368
See you back home!

1511
01:57:23,478 --> 01:57:26,107
Yeah!

1512
01:57:26,215 --> 01:57:29,145
Excuse me. Do you know him?
You know Josh?

1513
01:57:29,170 --> 01:57:30,372
Yeah. Yeah.

1514
01:57:30,457 --> 01:57:33,757
- Look, you have to tell me where he went.
- Who are you?

1515
01:57:34,930 --> 01:57:37,559
I'm... I'm his girlfriend.

1516
01:57:37,669 --> 01:57:41,731
Ew.

1517
01:57:41,842 --> 01:57:44,501
- Billy Kopecki.
- You have to tell me where he went.

1518
01:57:44,526 --> 01:57:45,915
Where did he go?

1519
01:57:45,916 --> 01:57:48,681
Please tell me.

1520
01:57:48,787 --> 01:57:50,846
Tell me!

1521
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:14,295
It's tough to find
a cab out here. Thanks.

1522
01:59:47,557 --> 01:59:49,650
Work, damn it!

1523
02:00:02,814 --> 02:00:05,716
I wish I was a kid again.

1524
02:00:22,916 --> 02:00:25,317
- Josh?
- Susan.

1525
02:00:25,420 --> 02:00:29,289
You know, you don't
walk out on somebody.

1526
02:00:29,394 --> 02:00:32,922
You don't just get up and leave
and... and... and walk out like that.

1527
02:00:33,034 --> 02:00:36,971
- You don't do that.
- I know. I know. I'm really sorry.

1528
02:00:37,074 --> 02:00:40,340
I'm really sorry,
but I didn't know what to do.

1529
02:00:40,445 --> 02:00:43,210
I didn't know what to say.

1530
02:01:02,516 --> 02:01:05,213
Oh, God.

1531
02:01:05,322 --> 02:01:08,258
You got your wish.

1532
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:11,091
- I tried to tell you.
- I didn't listen.

1533
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:13,328
I guess I didn't hear you,
or... or want to, or...

1534
02:01:13,353 --> 02:01:15,154
I tried to tell you last night.

1535
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,568
How would I have... Even if I
did listen, how would I know?

1536
02:01:17,593 --> 02:01:19,094
I've been thinking about this.

1537
02:01:19,179 --> 02:01:21,204
- Why would I know that?
- I've been trying...

1538
02:01:21,315 --> 02:01:24,217
I've been thinking about it, and there's
a million reasons for me to go home...

1539
02:01:24,320 --> 02:01:27,518
but there's only
one reason for me to stay.

1540
02:01:28,895 --> 02:01:31,625
What... What reason is that?

1541
02:01:33,803 --> 02:01:36,602
Well, you.

1542
02:01:38,811 --> 02:01:40,779
Oh, come on. Come on.

1543
02:01:40,881 --> 02:01:44,010
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

1544
02:01:49,196 --> 02:01:51,961
So, uh, what... what are you, 15, 16?

1545
02:01:54,773 --> 02:01:57,504
I'm... I'm 13.

1546
02:02:00,749 --> 02:02:02,740
Mm-hmm.

1547
02:02:02,852 --> 02:02:05,879
Well, that explains it.

1548
02:02:17,710 --> 02:02:20,236
Maybe you could come with me.

1549
02:02:23,287 --> 02:02:25,619
No.

1550
02:02:25,725 --> 02:02:29,388
- No, I...
- Why not?

1551
02:02:29,498 --> 02:02:32,526
I've... I've been there before.

1552
02:02:34,740 --> 02:02:38,643
It's hard enough the first time.

1553
02:02:40,015 --> 02:02:41,983
You know what I mean?

1554
02:02:43,856 --> 02:02:46,382
You don't know what I mean.

1555
02:02:54,975 --> 02:02:56,943
Come on. I'll drive you home.

1556
02:03:03,054 --> 02:03:06,616
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'll be okay.

1557
02:03:06,728 --> 02:03:08,719
You'll be fine.

1558
02:03:08,831 --> 02:03:11,426
Ten years, who knows?

1559
02:03:13,072 --> 02:03:15,438
Maybe you should hold on to my number.

1560
02:03:34,341 --> 02:03:36,400
So this is where you live.

1561
02:03:38,548 --> 02:03:41,950
- Which one is it?
- The one right there.

1562
02:03:42,055 --> 02:03:44,923
Oh. It's nice.

1563
02:03:49,267 --> 02:03:52,761
I'm gonna miss you.

1564
02:03:52,873 --> 02:03:55,239
I'm gonna miss you too.

1565
02:03:59,451 --> 02:04:03,582
- You won't even remember me.
- Oh, yes, I will.

1566
02:05:00,555 --> 02:05:02,989
Bye.

1567
02:06:07,392 --> 02:06:10,191
Ma?

1568
02:06:10,295 --> 02:06:13,459
- Ma, it's me.
- Josh?

1569
02:06:13,568 --> 02:06:16,436
Josh? Josh!

1570
02:06:16,540 --> 02:06:20,033
Oh, my God!
Oh, thank God you're home!

1571
02:06:20,146 --> 02:06:24,083
Oh, Ma,
I missed you all so much.

1572
02:06:33,101 --> 02:06:36,128
- I'm just not good enough.
- What are you talking about?

1573
02:06:36,240 --> 02:06:39,734
You've been hitting the ball over the
fence almost every time in stickball.

1574
02:06:39,846 --> 02:06:41,871
You just gotta get used
to a fatter bat.

1575
02:06:44,588 --> 02:06:46,715
- You really think I could do it?
- Yeah.

1576
02:06:46,825 --> 02:06:48,816
Come on. We'll hit
some after supper.

1577
02:06:48,929 --> 02:06:50,988
Okay, I'll call for you.
