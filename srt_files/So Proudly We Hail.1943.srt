1
00:02:57,302 --> 00:02:58,595
Welcome to Melbourne,

2
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,305
I bring you General
MacArthur's compliments.

3
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,182
Thank you, sir. I am Colonel Mason.

4
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:04,434
These gentlemen are Major
Arthur and Captain Lawrence.

5
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:07,229
How do you do? How do you
do? I'm Lieutenant Schwartz.

6
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,774
These are Lieutenants
Armstrong, Leonard,

7
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:14,611
O'Doul,

8
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:17,364
Bacelli,

9
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,950
Bollenbacher,

10
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,910
and Emerson.

11
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,080
I'm very happy to know you
all and thank God you're here.

12
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,124
We're sorry we haven't
a big welcoming committee

13
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,877
but we're trying to avoid
calling attention to your arrival

14
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,628
since we haven't heard
from the other girls yet.

15
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,255
Not even the girls on the other plane?

16
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:34,590
No word as yet.

17
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,133
Did any of the others get off?

18
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,093
We were told there were
10 more by submarine,

19
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,137
but we haven't heard
from them since they left.

20
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:43,015
Aren't there any more? They said
everyone was to be ordered off.

21
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,474
Everyone was ordered off,

22
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:47,561
but we could only get about
20 before it was too late.

23
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,731
The rest of the girls are in
the hands of those filthy...

24
00:03:50,814 --> 00:03:52,274
Then we should have stayed.

25
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,276
You were carrying out your orders,

26
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,446
and your further orders are to
proceed immediately to the hotel,

27
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,908
where the Red Cross has warm
baths and clean clothes for you.

28
00:04:01,325 --> 00:04:04,244
And my further, though
unofficial, orders are

29
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:07,623
you are to have your heart's
desire, anything you want.

30
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:09,875
And what do you want most in the world?

31
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:14,630
A tomato. A nice, big, red,
cool, round, juicy tomato.

32
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,138
Colonel, do you happen to know
when we're supposed to go home?

33
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,349
On the very next transport.

34
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,768
I thought there were eight of you.

35
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:31,980
Davy... I mean, Lieutenant
Davidson is just being brought off.

36
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:13,522
I wore a 6-A before
Bataan and I'm gonna get...

37
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:22,906
Say, what do you know? I've
forgotten how to walk in these things.

38
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,908
You better sit down
before you break your neck,

39
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,410
or else get a bigger size.

40
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,621
High heels. The things
we do to trap men.

41
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:32,499
Boy, this is sure a relief.

42
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:36,420
I know people mean well, but it's
nice to be by ourselves again.

43
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:40,591
Yeah, it gets embarrassing being
called a heroine all the time.

44
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,885
What is a heroine, anyway?

45
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,054
I don't know. Somebody
who's still alive, I guess.

46
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,848
If anybody calls me a heroine again,

47
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,767
I'm gonna let them have a
tomato right in the puss.

48
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,772
Ethel, you'll bust if
you eat another one.

49
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:59,151
I've lost 35 pounds in this
campaign and I got to get it back.

50
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:02,279
Keep them coming every 15 minutes,
if it's not too much trouble.

51
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,198
No trouble at all. It's
an honor and a privilege

52
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,116
to be serving a group
of heroines like you.

53
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,784
No, you can't!

54
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,763
This will do right
here, nurse. Yes, sir.

55
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,319
How is she, Major?

56
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:48,200
The closer we get to
home, the worse she gets.

57
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,285
What do you think's wrong?

58
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,495
It's simple.

59
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,039
When people don't
want to live, they die.

60
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,165
Oh, no.

61
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:56,959
I know we did the wrong thing.

62
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,919
She didn't want to
go, she wanted to stay

63
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,630
and when we got her on the
plane, she just collapsed.

64
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:05,384
If it were a mere physical
collapse, I'd know what to do.

65
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,470
Frankly, I'm desperate.

66
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:15,769
I wonder...

67
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,482
I wonder, perhaps, if you can help me.

68
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,901
We'll do anything, Doctor, anything.

69
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,903
It's not going to be easy.

70
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,739
I hate to ask you, even.

71
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:31,827
I know how much you all want to
forget what you've been through.

72
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,329
But I only have one hope left.

73
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,583
This letter is addressed to her.

74
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:39,877
It came through on the
last plane from Mindanao.

75
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,837
Who's the letter from, Major?

76
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,881
Signed by somebody called "John".

77
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,007
Oh, that's...

78
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,717
Just a moment, please.

79
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,681
I want you to tell me
everything you can remember,

80
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,517
things that might not even concern her.

81
00:07:55,893 --> 00:07:59,563
You never know. It might
have its place in the pattern.

82
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:05,694
Well, the first time I met
Lieutenant Davidson was last November.

83
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:08,739
We were all ordered to
embark from San Francisco.

84
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,450
I remember it was cold and drizzly,

85
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,703
and I had been staying
with Rosemary Larson.

86
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,830
It was her hometown,

87
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:20,083
and her family had come down
to the dock to see us off.

88
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,586
Goodbye, Mrs. Larson, and
thanks for a wonderful time.

89
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,795
I don't know when I've had better.

90
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,339
You should have stayed
around a little longer.

91
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,132
I'd have made a real hep cat out of you.

92
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:29,843
I don't know about the "hep".

93
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,346
Look, Mama, why don't
you go? You'll catch cold.

94
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,306
I won't. I want to see you go.

95
00:08:34,389 --> 00:08:36,350
Let Mama stay, Roselein.

96
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,685
You'd think I was going away for good.

97
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,398
Davy. I'm sorry.

98
00:08:43,857 --> 00:08:45,192
Can I see you for a moment?

99
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:46,693
This is Lieutenant O'Doul.

100
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:49,279
All present and accounted for now, sir.

101
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,156
Well, thank you.

102
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,450
Are orchids regulation now, Lieutenant?

103
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:56,161
They're not mine. A friend
of mine gave them to me.

104
00:08:56,245 --> 00:08:59,915
I see. Well, good luck,
Lieutenant, and bon voyage.

105
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,291
Thank you, sir.

106
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:03,335
Davy, you've gotta help
me. I'm in a terrible jam.

107
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:05,838
What's the matter? Two of
my fiances came to the dock.

108
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,922
Two?

109
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:11,134
You know how hard it is for me to say
no when somebody asks me to marry him.

110
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,345
I thought it would be easy
for you to say no by now.

111
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:14,638
Golly, it's all in fun,

112
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,849
but if these two Irishmen
ever meet up with each other...

113
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:18,392
I parked one of them over at the gate...

114
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,644
There you are, darling!

115
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:22,396
I've been looking all
over for you, Joan.

116
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,940
Well, I've been looking
all over for you too, dear.

117
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:27,609
You wait here. I'll be right back.

118
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,486
Don't forget to write, dear!

119
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,614
What does she mean,
don't forget to write?

120
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:34,324
Letters. You know, from the post office.

121
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,742
Well, she's not leaving yet.

122
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,370
Oh, Captain! Captain, will you
hold this for me just for a second?

123
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,872
Well... And this, here.

124
00:09:39,955 --> 00:09:42,332
But we haven't had a
chance to say good-bye yet.

125
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,127
There's lots of time to say good-bye.

126
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,378
Say, who wrote that?

127
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,880
Who wrote what?

128
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,549
"Whenever a snowflake leaves the sky

129
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:53,051
"It turns and turns to say 'Good-by!"'

130
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:55,721
Haven't the faintest idea.

131
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:57,014
Do you know the rest of it?

132
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,391
The rest of what? The poem.

133
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,726
No, never did.

134
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:02,144
Well, it goes,

135
00:10:02,186 --> 00:10:03,770
"Whenever a snowflake leaves the sky

136
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,190
"It turns and turns to say 'Good-by!"'

137
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,901
Good-bye. No, Captain,
I remember the rest.

138
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:13,655
"Good-by, dear clouds,
so cool and gray!"

139
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:17,367
And it goes something and
something "on its way".

140
00:10:18,202 --> 00:10:19,286
What does?

141
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,662
The snowflake.

142
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:22,498
How's that look?

143
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:24,166
It looks great. You're pretty. Thanks.

144
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,542
Davy, I want you to meet my mother

145
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,919
and dad, and my brother, Georgie.

146
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:29,379
Hold these, Georgie.
Bye, snowflake. Thanks.

147
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,882
Mother, this is Lieutenant
Davidson, our senior officer.

148
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,175
How do you do, Mrs. Larson?

149
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,471
I think we better be going.

150
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:42,935
Please, please. This is her first
time away. Take care of my baby.

151
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:45,062
Now, there's nothing to
worry about, Mrs. Larson.

152
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,482
I will worry. Is it not
so, a mother must worry?

153
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:50,359
Yes, I suppose so.

154
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,152
The days will be lonesome now.

155
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,696
The two years will go like wildfire.

156
00:10:54,738 --> 00:10:56,865
Yes, the years are short.

157
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,617
It's the days that are so long.

158
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,830
Now, don't you worry. I'll take care
of Rosemary. She'll be all right.

159
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:06,708
May God save you and keep you kindly,

160
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,752
and stand between you and harm.

161
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,254
Thank you.

162
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,798
Thanks again, Mrs. Larson.

163
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,425
I like you. You eat so much.

164
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,097
Goodbye, Mama.

165
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,100
Where's my cake? What
have you done with my cake?

166
00:11:23,183 --> 00:11:26,061
Frederick, her cake. I have it here.

167
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:29,606
Roselein! Roselein!

168
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,483
Now you've got me crying.

169
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:32,943
Good-bye.

170
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,571
But, darling, I did
look all over for you.

171
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,364
Joan!

172
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,699
Where did you go? Well, I...

173
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:40,742
Captain O'Rourke, I want
you to meet Captain O'Brien.

174
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,036
You two should know each other.

175
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:48,292
There you are, Captain.
I just remembered the end.

176
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,960
The end of what? Well,
you know, "The Snowflake".

177
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,086
Fine.

178
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,462
"Good-by, dear clouds,
so cool and gray!

179
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,548
"Then lightly travels on its way"

180
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:55,674
Yes.

181
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,926
Well, come on, Joan.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

182
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,845
Good-bye.
Good-bye, dear.

183
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:00,971
Good-bye!

184
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,891
Good-bye!
Good-bye! Good-bye!

185
00:12:05,142 --> 00:12:07,853
Thanks, pal. I don't know
whoever said the flesh was weak,

186
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,855
I find it very strong.

187
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:14,818
Say, you'll catch cold, leatherneck.

188
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:15,903
Who, me?

189
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,280
Never had a cold in my life.

190
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,377
We were to be stationed at Honolulu,

191
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:34,087
and although the boat was a slow one,

192
00:12:34,171 --> 00:12:36,381
we enjoyed every minute of it.

193
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:38,634
It was hard to believe it was December,

194
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:42,721
what with the tropical sea,
blue water and flying fish.

195
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:52,564
Hiya.

196
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:55,484
How's your cold, leatherneck?

197
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:59,488
It's not a cold. It's just
a running nose. Running...

198
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,033
You better not take too much of
this tropical sun, you'll get burned.

199
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:07,162
Who, me? I never burn.
Best tan you ever seen.

200
00:13:21,051 --> 00:13:22,928
Don't you ever get
tired of writing letters?

201
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:23,971
Uh-uh.

202
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,140
All doctors.

203
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,433
What's the date?

204
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,977
It's Sunday. We had chapel.

205
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,019
Sunday the what?

206
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:32,729
Sunday the seventh.

207
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,691
Thanks. I'll just head it, "Eighteen
shopping days until Christmas".

208
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:37,526
Maybe he'll take the hint.

209
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,904
Pearl Harbor.

210
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:45,492
Most of us didn't even know what
it was, let alone where it was.

211
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,286
So instead of landing at Hawaii,

212
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:50,414
we were ordered to join a
convoy somewhere in the Pacific.

213
00:13:50,497 --> 00:13:53,542
None of us realized what
the whole thing meant.

214
00:13:53,584 --> 00:13:56,336
Sweet Genevieve

215
00:13:56,336 --> 00:14:02,968
The days may come, the days may go

216
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:09,516
But still the hands of memory weave

217
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,895
That blissful dream

218
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:17,900
Of long ago

219
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,777
I'll open for two. For three.

220
00:14:21,195 --> 00:14:23,739
I'll see you. I'll stay.

221
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,158
I'll pass. Go ahead, bet.

222
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,076
Well, I would. You should see...

223
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,913
But you're not playing,
Elsie. Two, please.

224
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,418
I know it's not much of a convoy,

225
00:14:36,502 --> 00:14:39,087
but somehow those other ships
make me feel more comfortable.

226
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:43,133
It would be awful to be out
here on the ocean all alone.

227
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:44,426
These will do.

228
00:14:44,468 --> 00:14:46,970
I'll have three, please.

229
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:49,932
Do you think Pearl Harbor could
have been very much, Captain?

230
00:14:49,973 --> 00:14:51,600
Well, there's no official word yet.

231
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,228
Still has to be proved that an
airplane can sink a battleship

232
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:55,270
for my dough.

233
00:14:55,354 --> 00:14:58,273
We probably won't see
very much of the Jap fleet.

234
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,109
Is that Marine trying
to get your attention?

235
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:04,696
Hmm? Oh, him. He's just a
friend of mine from Kansas

236
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,323
who wants to show me his clippings.

237
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,492
He used to play football, I gathered.

238
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:09,743
Football? Who is he?

239
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,286
I really don't know.

240
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:13,455
Let's find out, shall we?

241
00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,917
Hey, Kansas, come on in.

242
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,053
Hi.

243
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,972
This is Captain Saunders,
Captain Lawrence.

244
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:31,390
How do you do?

245
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:34,351
They thought they'd like to see
your scrapbook. Read it to us.

246
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:37,855
Here with them? Yes. Go ahead.

247
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,147
Yes, sir.

248
00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:41,775
Read about your greatest
single personal exploit.

249
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,026
Oh, well...

250
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:44,611
What position did you play, Kansas?

251
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:49,366
Well, I sort of fooled around
at fullback. Used to play...

252
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:50,909
Carry on.

253
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,327
Yes, sir.

254
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:57,332
"One of the most thrilling
gridiron battles of the year,

255
00:15:57,416 --> 00:16:01,044
"when a light, underestimated
Kansas team defeated Notre Dame..".

256
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:04,381
Notre Dame? I thought Kansas
played only high schools.

257
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:06,758
No, sir. They play colleges.

258
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:10,762
Go ahead. Yes, sir.

259
00:16:10,846 --> 00:16:12,347
"Though at the end of the first half,

260
00:16:12,431 --> 00:16:15,809
"Notre Dame held a comfortable
14-to-nothing margin..".

261
00:16:15,893 --> 00:16:18,020
Very comfortable, I'd say.

262
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,523
Yeah. Margin...

263
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,359
"Nonetheless, in the second half,

264
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,570
"when the highly touted
'Weeping' Walachek,

265
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,072
"despite an injury,
was sent into the game,

266
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:31,867
"the Kansas Cyclones
scored three touchdowns

267
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,911
"in 10 minutes on runs of..".

268
00:16:33,952 --> 00:16:36,747
Say, I remember that game!
That was a terrific upset.

269
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,333
Did you play on the team
with "Weeping" Walachek?

270
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:42,044
Well... He's me.

271
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,047
Well, why didn't you tell us who he was?

272
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,798
I still don't know who he was.

273
00:16:46,882 --> 00:16:47,883
"Weeping" Walachek.

274
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:50,135
Yes, I know, but why "Weeping" Walachek?

275
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:51,970
Sort of a habit, I guess.

276
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,388
Everybody knew that
until he got good and mad

277
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:55,224
and started to cry, he couldn't play.

278
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,808
Then zowie! Touchdown.

279
00:16:56,892 --> 00:16:57,893
Let me see that book.

280
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,102
"The last race..".

281
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,229
Come on, let's get on with the game.

282
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,688
Just a minute, Joan, I wanna...

283
00:17:01,772 --> 00:17:02,731
Where's that Army game?

284
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,317
Right over here. I'll find it for you.

285
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,945
"Weeping" Walachek. What do you know?

286
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:10,030
The card game, hmm?

287
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,823
Just a minute, Joan, be
with you, just a minute.

288
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,950
Hey, here it is.

289
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:14,785
I remember that game. Boy, what a game!

290
00:17:14,868 --> 00:17:16,578
Boy, did you wreck the Army.

291
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,789
Yeah, well, it was just after that game

292
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,126
that I sort of figured I
better join the Marines.

293
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,758
Cigarette, miss. Sorry.

294
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,939
What's the matter with me? Have
I got dandruff or something?

295
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,650
I really can't tell
out here in the dark.

296
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,319
That's not what I mean.
I know what you mean.

297
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:53,282
Look, why won't you ever let me see you?

298
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:56,326
Officers are not supposed to
fraternize with enlisted men.

299
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:00,247
I don't want to
fraternize. I just wanna see you.

300
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,707
And pass the time of day?

301
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,084
Well, it'd be better than nothing.

302
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:06,753
Sunburn.

303
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:07,880
Well, just stop your maneuvers

304
00:18:07,963 --> 00:18:11,008
before you make contact
with the main body.

305
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:12,634
Don't you like me?

306
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:13,969
I like you.

307
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,513
That's just sort of, "So what," huh?

308
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,806
That's right.

309
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,646
Look, Lieutenant, if
it's something I've done,

310
00:18:24,688 --> 00:18:26,732
or if I just plain annoy you, I'm sorry.

311
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,567
I won't bother you anymore.

312
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:32,654
Don't go. I'm just being childish.

313
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,409
I sure would like to meet one guy,
though, who doesn't make a pass.

314
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:40,245
Well, when you do, you
better begin to worry.

315
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:41,705
You're not so dumb.

316
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,290
I just talk dumb.

317
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,001
But why can't men and women be pals?

318
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,128
'Cause only men and men are pals.

319
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:50,547
All right. Come on. Get it over with.

320
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:52,466
That's... Better.

321
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,843
Incidentally, I'm warning you, Kansas.

322
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:56,929
I melt at a very low temperature.

323
00:18:57,012 --> 00:18:59,056
Well, then, I'll try to be pals.

324
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,183
Okay and when you can't
stand it any longer,

325
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:03,435
from time to time I'll let you kiss me.

326
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,939
This one of those times?

327
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,232
Nope!

328
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:11,443
Okay, let me know.

329
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,197
Golly! What's that?

330
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,535
Subs, I guess.

331
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:00,200
We picked up a number of
survivors from the torpedoed ships

332
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:03,704
who were suffering from shock and
burns from the oil in the water.

333
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:07,249
They were pitifully few, but more
than we could accommodate in sick bay,

334
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,210
so we turned the salon
into a temporary hospital.

335
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,422
For a while we were so busy, it
kind of took our minds off the war.

336
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:17,509
One of the survivors, only slightly
burned, was a nurse from the other ship.

337
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:19,261
Her name was Olivia.

338
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:22,055
We tried to be friendly, but
she didn't want any part of us.

339
00:20:22,139 --> 00:20:24,266
So we didn't want any part of her.

340
00:20:24,808 --> 00:20:28,520
There you are, Olivia. I'm glad
it was no more serious than that.

341
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:30,189
Happy to see you up and about again.

342
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:31,481
Thank you.

343
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:43,118
Olivia, I'm glad to see
your bandage off. Let's see.

344
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,703
It's fine.

345
00:20:46,038 --> 00:20:48,499
You're a very lucky girl. Lucky?

346
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:50,709
Why, yes. We didn't get many survivors.

347
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:53,128
That's one way of looking at it.

348
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,298
Why did that boat leave
after Pearl Harbor?

349
00:20:56,381 --> 00:20:58,634
I realize we need supplies
in the Philippines, but...

350
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:01,887
I don't know, and I don't
ask a lot of questions.

351
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,431
I see.

352
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:07,351
Incidentally, your orders came
through. You're to join our unit.

353
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:08,977
Here are a couple of extra caps.

354
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,105
I've sent your new issue
to Room 10 on C-deck.

355
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,732
You'll bunk in with Miss Bacelli.

356
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:15,567
She's already mentioned it to me.

357
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,486
She doesn't want me to.

358
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,404
Oh.

359
00:21:20,155 --> 00:21:22,324
All right, I'll talk to her.

360
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,244
Let me have your scissors, Bacelli.

361
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:27,663
Tony, what's this about Olivia?

362
00:21:28,038 --> 00:21:29,331
I just don't want her around.

363
00:21:29,414 --> 00:21:30,999
But why? What's the matter?

364
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,584
Oversupply of gall.

365
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:34,628
Her gall bladder needs draining.

366
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:37,506
What she needs is a
permanent anesthetic.

367
00:21:37,589 --> 00:21:40,217
'Course, if it's an order,
she can come in with me.

368
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,761
Never mind, I'll get someone else.

369
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:45,222
Joan.

370
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,432
Joan, do you mind
Olivia bunking with you?

371
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:48,851
What did I do to get punished?

372
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,935
I'd do it myself,

373
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,187
only Rosemary's still a
little homesick and frightened.

374
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,690
That Olivia, I'd like to give her
an injection and leave the needle in.

375
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:56,275
But, okay, if I'm the victim.

376
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:59,027
Thanks. I don't know why I'm so nice.

377
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:02,739
Look, I'm perfectly all
right. When do I get up?

378
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:05,325
When you're told. Now, take
your shirt off like a nice boy.

379
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:06,368
What for?

380
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,204
Because I've got some
brand-new diapers for you.

381
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:12,457
Beautiful. Tell me, do you think I can
get my initials embroidered on those?

382
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:15,711
Sure. What are your
initials? D.O.P.E.? Here.

383
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,297
Great. This is going to be fine.

384
00:22:20,174 --> 00:22:22,342
What's that for? A bath,
I'm gonna give you a bath.

385
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,553
Oh, no. No female's going to bathe me.

386
00:22:24,595 --> 00:22:26,096
One of those.

387
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:29,474
Miss Davidson. Miss Davidson.

388
00:22:33,604 --> 00:22:34,730
The patient's supposed to have a bath,

389
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,982
and he refuses to let me give it to him.

390
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,525
All right, Miss O'Doul.

391
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:40,110
Thank you, nursey.

392
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,533
Lieutenant John Summers. Mmm-hmm.

393
00:22:46,617 --> 00:22:48,869
With the medical unit. Mmm-hmm.

394
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:52,372
Fine. A doctor and you
won't let a nurse wash you.

395
00:22:52,456 --> 00:22:54,666
I'm not a doctor, I'm a technician.

396
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,252
I was associate professor
of Chemistry at Hawaii.

397
00:22:57,336 --> 00:23:00,339
I see. A professor.
Well, that explains it.

398
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:01,673
What are you doing?

399
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,468
You're going to have a
bath, and don't be coy.

400
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,512
I don't care how dirty I may be.

401
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:09,264
You reek. I can still smell
that oil you were swimming in.

402
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,350
No female's going to bathe me.

403
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,726
Your mother did.

404
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,603
Only until I was big
enough to knock her down.

405
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,731
All right now, which is it to be,

406
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:19,733
the sheet or your arm?

407
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,574
Angels of mercy, huh?
You're a bunch of wrestlers.

408
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,246
What's the matter?

409
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:33,497
My head.

410
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,124
Feel dizzy? Yes.

411
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:37,751
No feeling in your hands and feet?

412
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:38,836
Yes, that's right.

413
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:40,420
You're lying.

414
00:23:57,396 --> 00:24:00,983
When people get to know you
awfully well, what do they call you?

415
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,109
Lieutenant.

416
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:03,193
Oh.

417
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:06,238
All right. Turn over
and get your back done.

418
00:24:13,829 --> 00:24:16,623
This isn't as humiliating as I thought.

419
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,253
Hey, that's nice. Do it again.

420
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:22,588
Get down.

421
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:26,466
Since you like this so much, I'm
gonna let you do it every day.

422
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:29,511
That'll be such fun. Now turn over.

423
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,018
Here.

424
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:42,858
Most of the patients were up
and about by Christmas Eve.

425
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,402
We'd been on the high
seas for almost a month,

426
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,696
and the people were
getting kind of jittery.

427
00:24:47,738 --> 00:24:49,406
So the Chaplain
arranged with the Captain

428
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,242
to have a little Christmas party.

429
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:54,536
Joan, I think you were
with Janet that evening.

430
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,663
Maybe you could tell what
happened better than I.

431
00:24:56,747 --> 00:25:00,250
Well, I remember we
all decided to dress up.

432
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:02,377
I wanted to make an
impression on Kansas,

433
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:05,130
and the only snakey thing
I had was a black nightgown,

434
00:25:05,214 --> 00:25:08,050
which, with a few trimmings, did for me.

435
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,180
Hey, Rosemary, give me
a hand, will you? Sure.

436
00:25:13,263 --> 00:25:15,474
Davy, aren't you dressing for the party?

437
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,351
I don't think so, dear.

438
00:25:17,434 --> 00:25:19,520
How about here? Is that all right?

439
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:23,273
This is for Lieutenant Davidson.

440
00:25:23,315 --> 00:25:24,775
Thank you.

441
00:25:26,527 --> 00:25:28,570
Doesn't Rosemary look nice? Yes.

442
00:25:28,654 --> 00:25:29,905
Where'd you get that sash?

443
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:33,116
Just part of an old surgical
gown I dyed with mercurochrome.

444
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,576
It's nice.

445
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,095
And he's never seen you out of uniform.

446
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:54,638
Who?

447
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,431
Who do you think?

448
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,183
You mean Lieutenant Summers?

449
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,394
It's still formal with you two.

450
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,063
Well, you better get informal
with him, or other people will.

451
00:26:03,146 --> 00:26:05,440
He's a pretty cute guy, you know.

452
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:09,528
Pretty soigne, huh? How
does it look, Rosemary?

453
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,488
Haven't you got anything simpler?

454
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,491
Simpler? Well, I have some
other things in my musette bag.

455
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:16,493
I don't know if you'd call them simple.

456
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,413
Come on in. It's over there someplace.

457
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:26,962
This ought to be about
right, the locket.

458
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:29,256
That isn't mine, it must be Olivia's.

459
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,758
Let's see. I don't think she'd mind.

460
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:33,302
I like it!

461
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,805
Hello, Olivia.

462
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:38,807
Take that off.

463
00:26:38,849 --> 00:26:40,309
Well, I only want to wear it tonight.

464
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,935
I said take that off.

465
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,021
What do you mean, snooping
around in my things?

466
00:26:44,104 --> 00:26:46,231
She didn't. I found it...

467
00:26:46,315 --> 00:26:48,567
Say, who do you think you are?

468
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:49,943
You wanna play rough!

469
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:51,653
Davy! Davy!

470
00:26:51,737 --> 00:26:53,739
Stop it! Stop it!

471
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,949
She started it and I don't
get slugged by anybody!

472
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,160
Stop it! Now, I order you to stop it!

473
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:01,246
What are you, a couple of
children? Now what's up?

474
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,331
Sorry, Davy.

475
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:05,292
It was my fault, Davy! By mistake,
I opened Olivia's musette bag.

476
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:06,460
She had no right to open it.

477
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:07,711
She said it was a mistake.

478
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:09,671
Now I don't care whose fault
it was, you were both wrong,

479
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,089
you realize that, don't you?

480
00:27:11,173 --> 00:27:13,842
I don't want to have to
take any official action.

481
00:27:13,926 --> 00:27:15,761
Look, I know we're
all nervous and jittery

482
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,804
on a boat going nowhere, getting nowhere

483
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,183
but we've got to hang on a
little longer, that's all.

484
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,727
I don't want this to
go outside this cabin.

485
00:27:23,769 --> 00:27:25,020
Now, forget it and shake hands.

486
00:27:25,103 --> 00:27:26,647
Sorry, Olivia.

487
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,609
All right, Joan.

488
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:41,370
Joan's just impulsive. She
didn't really mean any harm.

489
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,123
Come on. Why don't
you go up with me? Hmm?

490
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:47,125
It may be our last party in a long time.

491
00:27:47,209 --> 00:27:49,461
Leave me alone, can't you?

492
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:59,221
Silent night

493
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:04,560
Holy night

494
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:10,107
All is calm

495
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:15,487
All is bright

496
00:28:16,113 --> 00:28:20,868
Round yon Virgin

497
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:26,290
Mother and child

498
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:31,086
Holy infant

499
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:36,592
So tender and mild

500
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:44,558
Sleep in heavenly peace

501
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:55,569
Sleep in heavenly peace

502
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:06,663
Merry Christmas.

503
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,208
Merry Christmas.

504
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,962
May I have your attention, please?

505
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,258
Thank you. I'm sure we're going
to have a lot of fun here tonight.

506
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:22,471
Now, before we begin, I personally
want to thank the Chaplain

507
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,140
for producing this
seagoing Christmas tree.

508
00:29:27,976 --> 00:29:28,977
Thank you.

509
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:31,522
All right, Reverend. It's your party.

510
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,065
Thanks.

511
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:37,694
Before we get on with it,

512
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:41,532
there is something in my heart
that I would like to say to you.

513
00:29:41,615 --> 00:29:43,534
This is the night before Christmas

514
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:46,829
and because it is, you must
forgive me for being sentimental.

515
00:29:46,912 --> 00:29:50,874
We're a sentimental people,
and I think we're proud of it.

516
00:29:50,916 --> 00:29:54,419
Despite the fact that our
enemies deride us for it,

517
00:29:54,503 --> 00:29:56,880
it makes us the stronger.

518
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:01,677
It is ironic even to try to talk
about the spirit of Christmas

519
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,972
when war is flaming
throughout the globe,

520
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,933
but we believe in this great truth.

521
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:15,482
And so all I want to say in
the tragedy all about us is,

522
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:17,651
have faith.

523
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:19,987
Not a blind faith,

524
00:30:21,113 --> 00:30:24,867
but faith in those things
in which we believe.

525
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,703
We must have such faith in those things,

526
00:30:27,786 --> 00:30:32,166
such faith in ourselves,
such faith in mankind

527
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:35,627
that we are tough about
the things we believe in,

528
00:30:35,711 --> 00:30:39,548
so tough that we will fight to the death

529
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:44,678
to make those tender
and sentimental beliefs

530
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:49,474
like Christmas a reality forever.

531
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:54,563
Now, God bless us, everyone.

532
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:08,160
And let me wish you a merry Christmas!

533
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,037
How about some music?

534
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,889
Hey, Kansas!

535
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,725
Why don't you come on in?

536
00:31:31,808 --> 00:31:34,770
All the rules are off
tonight. It's Christmas.

537
00:31:34,853 --> 00:31:37,814
Yeah, a fine Christmas. No mistletoe.

538
00:31:38,524 --> 00:31:41,693
All right, if it means
that much to you, here.

539
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:50,452
Merry Christmas!

540
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:54,289
See? What'd I tell you?

541
00:31:58,544 --> 00:31:59,753
Get my present?

542
00:31:59,837 --> 00:32:01,338
Yes, thank you.

543
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,174
Well, what's mine in return?

544
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:05,926
My thanks.

545
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:09,304
I suppose I'll have to be
satisfied with just that.

546
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:14,059
You realize this is the first
time you've been in my arms?

547
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:15,811
I've been in lots of arms.

548
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:19,481
Yes, but these are mine. I
want you to get used to them.

549
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:25,487
Say, Kansas, you know,
we've never danced together.

550
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:27,239
Wanna? Can you?

551
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:31,869
Sure. I used to fool around
a little bit. Used to...

552
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,581
Say, don't waste that.

553
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:37,124
Pretty hot stuff.

554
00:32:50,262 --> 00:32:51,805
What's the matter with you, Davy?

555
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:52,890
Why?

556
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:54,725
You seem to be smiling all over.

557
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:00,397
Good heavens! Aren't you in bed yet?

558
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,482
Believe it or not, I was
on the top deck with Kansas

559
00:33:02,566 --> 00:33:04,568
singing Christmas carols.

560
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:07,112
Can I bunk in here, Davy?

561
00:33:07,196 --> 00:33:08,864
Did you have another row with Olivia?

562
00:33:08,906 --> 00:33:10,032
No, but she's scary,

563
00:33:10,073 --> 00:33:12,367
she just lies there and
stares and never goes to sleep.

564
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,120
It's like sleeping in a graveyard.

565
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,039
Okay, you take my bed.

566
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,665
I'll try it for the night, anyway.

567
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:19,917
Thanks, pal.

568
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,128
Has she ever opened up? Ever
give you a hint of what's wrong?

569
00:33:23,212 --> 00:33:27,382
There's nothing wrong. She's just
naturally a frozen-faced ghoul.

570
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,230
Are you asleep, Olivia? No.

571
00:33:42,856 --> 00:33:45,484
Do you mind if I turn on the light? No.

572
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,239
Is it all right if I bunk in here? Yes.

573
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:56,578
What's the matter, Olivia?

574
00:33:56,662 --> 00:33:57,704
Something's hurt you.

575
00:33:57,788 --> 00:34:00,624
Why don't you talk about
it, get it off your chest?

576
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:03,126
You can forget I'm
your superior officer.

577
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:07,089
It's none of your business, so don't
forget you are my superior officer.

578
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,927
Maybe if I knew what was
eating you, I could help.

579
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,638
Nobody can. I don't want anybody to try.

580
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,140
I can do it myself.

581
00:34:20,978 --> 00:34:23,772
Why did you lose your temper
when Joan... Put that down!

582
00:34:23,856 --> 00:34:26,108
Do I go through your things?

583
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,235
I don't think we better talk anymore.

584
00:34:28,318 --> 00:34:30,070
I'm beginning to get pretty sore.

585
00:34:30,154 --> 00:34:32,239
All right, so you're beginning
to get sore, enjoy it,

586
00:34:32,322 --> 00:34:34,992
but stop prying into things
that don't concern you.

587
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,994
Maybe it does concern me.

588
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:40,289
It concerns me that the morale
of this group remains high.

589
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,166
Until you joined up, it was.

590
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:44,168
But you're just a troublemaker.

591
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:47,045
But I don't really care
what's bothering you at all.

592
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:49,464
I don't like you any more
than the rest of the girls do.

593
00:34:49,506 --> 00:34:51,633
I'm supposed to be a
nurse and that's all.

594
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:54,761
No, there's more than
that, now that we're at war.

595
00:34:54,845 --> 00:34:56,388
Maybe you don't know what's up,

596
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:58,682
maybe you don't know
what we're doing here.

597
00:34:58,765 --> 00:35:00,684
You think I don't know.

598
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,978
All right, I'll tell you.
I know what I'm doing.

599
00:35:03,061 --> 00:35:05,480
I know why I'm here. I
know what I'm going to do.

600
00:35:05,522 --> 00:35:06,899
I'm going to kill Japs.

601
00:35:06,982 --> 00:35:09,318
Every bloodstained one
I can get my hands on!

602
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:10,402
Olivia.

603
00:35:10,486 --> 00:35:12,654
That doesn't sound nice
coming from a nurse, does it?

604
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:14,156
We're supposed to be angels of mercy,

605
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,783
we're supposed to tend to the
wounded and take care of the sick.

606
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:18,202
We're supposed to be kind and tender,

607
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,162
and serve humanity in
the name of humanity.

608
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:22,122
What humanity? Jap humanity?

609
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:23,415
Olivia, be quiet.

610
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:25,167
No, you asked me. You wanted to know.

611
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,294
You pried into things
that didn't concern you.

612
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:29,505
You wanted to know what this is.

613
00:35:29,546 --> 00:35:32,633
Look, look at that!
Do you know what it is?

614
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:34,885
I'll tell you, it's a boy!

615
00:35:35,302 --> 00:35:38,472
Come in, both of you.
You wanted to know, too.

616
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:40,349
Today is Christmas, isn't it?

617
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:43,352
The time for cheer and good
fellowship and for peace.

618
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:46,522
Well, today's my wedding
day. You see that?

619
00:35:46,897 --> 00:35:49,399
He and I were to be
married today in St. Louis,

620
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:50,734
and why weren't we?

621
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:54,238
Because he's dead. He
died that first morning.

622
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,532
They killed him. I saw him.

623
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:00,160
He was running across the field
to his plane and they killed him.

624
00:36:00,244 --> 00:36:02,412
Sixty bullets! Sixty!

625
00:36:02,538 --> 00:36:05,165
By the time I got to him, he was dead.

626
00:36:05,249 --> 00:36:07,876
His face was gone! I
couldn't see him anymore!

627
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,379
Just blood! Blood all over!

628
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,967
Olivia! Don't.

629
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,927
Let me go! Let me go!

630
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:19,429
They must be punished and
I'm going to punish them!

631
00:36:19,513 --> 00:36:20,806
Yes, dear.

632
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,642
He was dead. It was ended for him.

633
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:25,060
Livvie, darling.

634
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:29,606
I wanted him. He was all I had.

635
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:30,858
Yes, dear.

636
00:36:30,983 --> 00:36:32,860
I loved him so much.

637
00:36:35,362 --> 00:36:38,323
The next few days, we
really began to get jittery.

638
00:36:38,407 --> 00:36:40,033
The Japs kept jamming our radio,

639
00:36:40,117 --> 00:36:42,244
so we never knew what was going on,

640
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:45,247
and the rumor factory
was going full blast.

641
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:50,043
...all over Los Angeles.

642
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:52,296
Quiet, listen!

643
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:55,632
It seems Honolulu itself...

644
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,386
Say, Davy, we just heard on
the radio, we lost Honolulu!

645
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,096
Now, how could you hear
that? I heard it, too.

646
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,390
All it said was, "Blah,
blah, blah, Honolulu".

647
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,475
San Francisco's in flames. I know that.

648
00:37:05,559 --> 00:37:07,311
Tony, turn that thing down.

649
00:37:07,477 --> 00:37:10,105
You talk like a bunch of old
women. You know what I think?

650
00:37:10,189 --> 00:37:12,900
I think you better all give
up thinking for the duration.

651
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:14,193
We haven't lost Honolulu,

652
00:37:14,276 --> 00:37:17,237
and there's been no bombing either
in Los Angeles or San Francisco.

653
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,447
Who said so?

654
00:37:18,489 --> 00:37:21,158
I just read the
communique the Captain got.

655
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:24,286
The truth is, Manila's
been declared an open city.

656
00:37:24,369 --> 00:37:25,454
What does that mean?

657
00:37:25,496 --> 00:37:26,955
It means we can't land there.

658
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,957
Well, then are we going back home?

659
00:37:28,999 --> 00:37:32,336
We can't go back. The Army needs
what supplies we've got on board.

660
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,380
We've been ordered to a place
called Bataan, Bataan Peninsula.

661
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,508
It's in command of General MacArthur.

662
00:37:37,591 --> 00:37:39,885
Well, if it's good enough for
a general, it's good enough me,

663
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,261
as long as they got plenty to eat.

664
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:44,681
I only hope it's got a decent
beauty parlor. My hair's a mess.

665
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:53,774
Hello.

666
00:37:53,857 --> 00:37:56,652
Hello. Have you been trying to avoid me?

667
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,779
Frankly, I have.

668
00:37:58,862 --> 00:37:59,947
Why?

669
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,365
Because...

670
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,367
Because I've been trying to avoid you.

671
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:04,993
Well, let's get away from here.

672
00:38:05,077 --> 00:38:06,078
The noise of these engines...

673
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:07,830
I find the noise very reassuring.

674
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:09,248
Come on.

675
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,669
Now, I don't want to seem impetuous.

676
00:38:13,752 --> 00:38:14,837
You don't?

677
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,964
All right, I do want
to seem impetuous, then.

678
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:18,966
But the point is, anything can happen.

679
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:21,260
Such as? The boat might sink.

680
00:38:21,343 --> 00:38:22,761
It might.

681
00:38:22,845 --> 00:38:25,931
If it does, we might
never see each other again.

682
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:28,475
That's possible.

683
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,727
Perhaps someplace in the hereafter,

684
00:38:30,811 --> 00:38:32,813
but then I wouldn't have my body.

685
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:36,441
What's more important, you
wouldn't have yours, either.

686
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,944
That might be very interesting.

687
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,320
Well, I'll see you there sometime.

688
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:43,323
Wait a minute! I haven't
made my point yet.

689
00:38:43,407 --> 00:38:44,867
After all, I'm not so bad looking.

690
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:47,244
I'm supposed to be very
intelligent, in fact.

691
00:38:47,327 --> 00:38:49,496
I work hard. I make $5,000 a year.

692
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,374
Oh, you make $166 a month now.

693
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:56,044
Please, I mean this. I'm in
love with you, Lieutenant.

694
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,715
If only we'd met somewhere else before.

695
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,176
You'd have had a wonderful
time as I wooed you.

696
00:39:02,259 --> 00:39:03,343
You think so?

697
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:05,888
I'm positive. I'd have
really been foolish.

698
00:39:05,971 --> 00:39:10,225
I feel foolish enough now, but then
I would have spent sleepless nights,

699
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,685
bought flowers to lay at your feet,

700
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,937
flowers I couldn't
possibly have afforded.

701
00:39:14,021 --> 00:39:16,106
I'd have been over meticulous
with you in taxicabs,

702
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,109
knowing, of course, you're
not that kind of girl.

703
00:39:19,276 --> 00:39:21,153
At first, I think my dog-like devotion

704
00:39:21,236 --> 00:39:23,238
would have made you pity me a little.

705
00:39:23,322 --> 00:39:25,574
Then my fatal charm would
have snuck up on you,

706
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:27,326
and before you knew it, you'd be mine

707
00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:30,537
in some dingy little French restaurant

708
00:39:30,621 --> 00:39:32,956
where the wine wasn't too bad.

709
00:39:33,415 --> 00:39:34,583
But with all that's happening,

710
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:36,835
I don't have to be
ridiculous for you to love me.

711
00:39:37,002 --> 00:39:38,212
There's no time.

712
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:41,465
Out there this second, a torpedo
may be spinning its way toward us

713
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,050
and you've no time, either.

714
00:39:43,133 --> 00:39:45,302
I think when you knew me, you'd
love me, but there's no time.

715
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:48,514
Don't you see, we haven't
got a second to waste.

716
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:50,182
You're right.

717
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,393
There's no time, no time
for anything personal.

718
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,897
Thanks for everything you said.

719
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,440
Maybe everything you say is true

720
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:01,568
and maybe you wouldn't have
had to do all those things.

721
00:40:01,652 --> 00:40:04,112
I'd have stopped you the moment
I knew. You know now, don't you?

722
00:40:04,196 --> 00:40:05,989
No, please, John,
don't make it difficult.

723
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,241
I've been trying to avoid you.

724
00:40:07,324 --> 00:40:09,117
That ought to tell you something.

725
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,287
I can't love you, I won't
permit myself to. Why not?

726
00:40:12,329 --> 00:40:13,789
Because I've got a job to do.

727
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:15,958
What's that got to do with
it? We've all got jobs to do.

728
00:40:16,041 --> 00:40:18,377
I know, but our
responsibilities are greater now.

729
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,629
Nothing can stand in the way.

730
00:40:24,341 --> 00:40:26,635
You do look a little foolish.

731
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:30,806
I wish we had met somewhere in
a dingy little French restaurant.

732
00:40:30,889 --> 00:40:32,766
But maybe we will.

733
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:34,351
Good night.

734
00:40:34,434 --> 00:40:35,686
Let me kiss you good-bye, then?

735
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:37,479
No. Just once?

736
00:40:41,275 --> 00:40:43,318
Oh, no, please. Please.

737
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:53,912
What's the matter?

738
00:40:53,996 --> 00:40:56,039
Listen, the engines have stopped!

739
00:40:56,123 --> 00:40:57,624
Your life preserver.

740
00:40:58,208 --> 00:40:59,793
Where's your life preserver?
I left it in the cabin.

741
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,795
Here, take mine, take it. No.

742
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,882
Darling, before anything
happens, tell me, do you love me?

743
00:41:04,965 --> 00:41:06,758
No. You're lying. You do love me.

744
00:41:06,842 --> 00:41:08,302
Yes. Well, say it then.

745
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:09,636
I love you.

746
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,346
Better get down to your stations.

747
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,806
What are the engines stopped for?

748
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,266
Run up to the Captain.
I'm sure he'd be delighted

749
00:41:14,349 --> 00:41:16,059
to tell you over a scotch and soda.

750
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,562
Is it one of ours? Sounds like it.

751
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,359
It is. It's a PBY.

752
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:32,701
I guess Bataan can't
be so very far away.

753
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,210
We landed at Mariveles, a small,
snug harbor on Bataan Peninsula,

754
00:41:41,251 --> 00:41:44,421
which the Navy used as
an emergency supply base.

755
00:41:54,973 --> 00:41:56,558
Lieutenant Davidson? Yes, sir.

756
00:41:56,642 --> 00:41:58,560
The CO wants to see you
immediately. Yes, sir.

757
00:41:58,602 --> 00:41:59,603
This is Ling Chee.

758
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:00,729
How do you do? How do you do?

759
00:42:00,812 --> 00:42:02,397
He's going to drive
you to your destination.

760
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,858
You leave right away, Mr.
Ling will take you to the CO.

761
00:42:04,942 --> 00:42:06,401
Thank you.

762
00:42:10,864 --> 00:42:12,574
It's good to be on land again.

763
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,576
Have you been in the
Army long, Mr. Ling?

764
00:42:14,618 --> 00:42:17,246
No, I was editor of
the Chinese Advertiser

765
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:19,790
and I'm happy to say like Abu Ben Adhem,

766
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:22,835
my name led all the rest
on the Japanese blacklist.

767
00:42:22,918 --> 00:42:24,586
Girls, this is Mr. Ling Chee

768
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:26,630
who's going to be with us
for the rest of the trip.

769
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,757
Now, each one find her own duffel bag.

770
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,468
Heap big war. Him near here, savvy?

771
00:42:31,802 --> 00:42:34,721
I'm a Chinese,
Lieutenant, not an Indian.

772
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,099
The war is just beyond the mountains.

773
00:42:44,982 --> 00:42:47,067
Sir, Lieutenant Davidson.

774
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:49,486
Colonel White.

775
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,864
I thought it might be
you when I saw the name.

776
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:53,615
My goodness, you've grown
into a beautiful woman.

777
00:42:53,657 --> 00:42:54,783
Thank you.

778
00:42:54,825 --> 00:42:56,785
Where was it? Shanghai.

779
00:42:56,827 --> 00:43:00,205
I remember now. It was just
after you lost your dad.

780
00:43:00,497 --> 00:43:02,416
Well, welcome to Bataan. Thank you, sir.

781
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:03,584
And you're in the Army, too?

782
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:07,004
Yes, and very happy. Happier
still that you're our CO.

783
00:43:07,087 --> 00:43:09,590
I'm a terribly strict
disciplinarian, Janet.

784
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,009
Now these are your orders.

785
00:43:12,092 --> 00:43:15,971
To proceed immediately to Limay,
our number one base hospital.

786
00:43:17,389 --> 00:43:21,977
Now, here's Limay, this is
where you landed at Mariveles,

787
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,896
and over there is Corregidor,

788
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:27,065
and up there beyond Limay about
40 kilometers are the front lines.

789
00:43:27,149 --> 00:43:28,817
Thank you, sir.

790
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:33,572
Pardon me, Colonel White, where
is the fourth medical unit?

791
00:43:33,655 --> 00:43:35,157
The fourth unit? Let me see.

792
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,701
They were the first ones off they
disembarked early this afternoon.

793
00:43:37,784 --> 00:43:40,245
They've gone. To what base, sir?

794
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:42,873
Base? They're based on the front lines.

795
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,000
They're probably there by now.

796
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,461
The technicians, too?

797
00:43:47,544 --> 00:43:49,671
Well, there's nothing for
them to get technical with,

798
00:43:49,713 --> 00:43:52,007
except maybe a stretcher.

799
00:43:52,090 --> 00:43:53,675
Thank you, sir.

800
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:01,433
Hey, Joan!

801
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:06,855
Hi, Kansas.

802
00:44:06,897 --> 00:44:08,816
Gosh, I've been looking
all over for you.

803
00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:10,692
I just wanted to say so long.

804
00:44:10,776 --> 00:44:15,072
Well, I'll be seeing you.
Kansas, are you scared, too?

805
00:44:15,364 --> 00:44:19,034
You mean, you feel as if
you suddenly lost your belly?

806
00:44:19,117 --> 00:44:21,036
Yeah. Me, too.

807
00:44:21,078 --> 00:44:23,580
But that's just like in a football game.

808
00:44:23,664 --> 00:44:26,542
You stand there waiting
for the whistle to blow,

809
00:44:26,625 --> 00:44:28,627
and all of a sudden
your knees get like water

810
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:31,004
and you feel like throwing up.

811
00:44:31,755 --> 00:44:33,257
Then, all of a sudden it toots.

812
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,884
Don't do that.

813
00:44:35,968 --> 00:44:37,135
Then the first thing you know,

814
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:39,888
you're in there and
you're not scared anymore.

815
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,515
I hope so.

816
00:44:41,598 --> 00:44:44,476
So long, Kansas, and don't get lost!

817
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,479
Who, me? How could I get lost?

818
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,149
Hey! Your gang went
in the other direction.

819
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:51,400
Well...

820
00:44:53,902 --> 00:44:56,572
Thank you. Don't let
anything happen to you.

821
00:44:56,655 --> 00:44:59,449
Who, me? How could
anything happen to me?

822
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,882
Look, don't say anything
else, except good-bye.

823
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:16,341
Good-bye.

824
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,806
Here's some gum. A little
farewell present for the girls.

825
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,474
Thank you. So long.

826
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:27,019
So long, girls. Good luck. Bye-bye.

827
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,104
You, too. See you later.

828
00:45:37,321 --> 00:45:39,740
We arrived at Limay late that night.

829
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:44,119
It was a dusty little village where the
Army had established a small supply base.

830
00:45:44,161 --> 00:45:46,163
But with the sudden change in plans,

831
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,708
the warehouses became hospitals
and headquarters for the nurses.

832
00:45:49,791 --> 00:45:52,920
This was to be our home.
We were glad to be there,

833
00:45:53,003 --> 00:45:56,548
and glad mostly at the thought
of a night's sleep on solid earth.

834
00:45:56,757 --> 00:45:59,635
Hello. Are we glad to see you.

835
00:46:01,678 --> 00:46:03,430
Well, the old homestead
hasn't changed a bit.

836
00:46:03,514 --> 00:46:06,391
Easy, there. One at a time.

837
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,606
Captain McGregor? Yes?

838
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,233
Lieutenant Davidson reporting.

839
00:46:14,399 --> 00:46:15,943
Well, you finally got here.

840
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:18,028
Hello, Ma. O'Doul, isn't it?

841
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:20,322
Yes, Fort Sam Houston. We used
to call her "Ma" at Fort Sam.

842
00:46:20,405 --> 00:46:21,782
Her bite's much worse than her bark.

843
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:24,660
But I bark, too. Now, you
better all dive into your whites.

844
00:46:24,743 --> 00:46:26,286
I'll get you some Gl tomorrow.

845
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:29,498
You can't wear whites here. The
nearest laundry is in Manila.

846
00:46:29,581 --> 00:46:31,124
We need you right away.

847
00:46:31,208 --> 00:46:34,461
Some of our girls have forgotten
what the word "sleep" means.

848
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:37,005
Chee, show them to nurses' quarters.

849
00:46:37,089 --> 00:46:39,258
Now, get a move on, will
you? I'm glad you're here.

850
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:40,759
Thank you.

851
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,390
Captain? Yes?

852
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:49,226
Do you have any Japanese
wounded here? A few.

853
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:50,477
I'd like to handle them.

854
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:51,812
Do you know the language?

855
00:46:51,895 --> 00:46:54,148
No, but I'm anxious to learn.

856
00:46:54,565 --> 00:46:57,943
Well, I guess you can be accommodated.
I'll put you down for Ward 11.

857
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:00,696
Thank you, Captain. The name is D'Arcy.

858
00:47:06,034 --> 00:47:07,661
And be careful of the foxholes.

859
00:47:07,744 --> 00:47:09,580
Where are they? They're all over.

860
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:11,290
Well, can't you see them? No.

861
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:12,833
Well, then, how do you
know where they are?

862
00:47:12,916 --> 00:47:15,335
If you fall in one, you'll know.

863
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,214
This is Ward 7. That's me.

864
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:22,050
Next to it is the children's
ward. That's for me.

865
00:47:22,134 --> 00:47:24,553
See you later, kids. Good-bye.

866
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:27,723
And this is the surgery. Come
on, Rosemary, you go with me.

867
00:47:27,806 --> 00:47:30,475
Good night, girls. Good night.

868
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:33,562
Over there is number three.
Number three? That's me.

869
00:47:33,604 --> 00:47:34,646
Good night.

870
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,690
And this is Ward number 11.

871
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:38,233
This is where we keep the prisoners.

872
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,443
Why aren't the numbers in order?

873
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:43,030
We mix them up so as to
confuse the Japs and ourselves.

874
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:46,200
They certainly are confusing me.

875
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,275
I'm D'Arcy.

876
00:48:20,359 --> 00:48:23,237
Patterson. I'm so glad you're here.

877
00:48:23,779 --> 00:48:27,449
I'm sorry, but they all need their
dressings changed when you get around to it.

878
00:48:27,491 --> 00:48:29,785
Run along. I'll take over. Thanks.

879
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:31,537
Night. Night.

880
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:01,525
Respiration all right here? Yes, Doctor.

881
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,780
Oh, here. It's just exhaustion.

882
00:49:06,864 --> 00:49:10,409
The poor kid. Get her
to bed. We'll take over.

883
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,244
Where are your surgery masks?

884
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:14,830
Masks? We used them all up long ago.

885
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:17,291
You go on in. I'll have to scrub again.

886
00:49:21,128 --> 00:49:22,421
I'm sorry. I can't understand you.

887
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:26,258
I'm sorry. I tore my glove. Help
me on with a new one, please.

888
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:29,178
I mean... I mean, hurry, please.

889
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:32,848
What is the case, Doctor? Cesarean.

890
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:33,974
Cesarean?

891
00:49:34,057 --> 00:49:36,476
Oh, yes. You seem surprised.

892
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,647
I have a peacetime practice
as well as a wartime practice.

893
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,733
My name is Jose Bardia,

894
00:49:42,816 --> 00:49:45,402
University of Philippines
and Johns Hopkins.

895
00:49:45,486 --> 00:49:46,528
I'm Miss Larson.

896
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:49,698
Those are good hands for
surgery. We can use them here.

897
00:49:49,781 --> 00:49:51,700
All right, Miss Larson.

898
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,038
You must forgive me if I
talk while I'm operating.

899
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:58,874
I'm so used to lecturing to my students.

900
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:00,751
Sponge.

901
00:50:01,084 --> 00:50:05,339
Sometimes, I thank my stars
for my scientific education.

902
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:06,882
It makes me objective.

903
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:09,551
Broken bone, let's set it.

904
00:50:09,593 --> 00:50:12,679
You know what to do. A baby to be born.

905
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:17,184
Breach delivery. Forceps.
Only three out of five live.

906
00:50:17,601 --> 00:50:19,228
Live for what?

907
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:23,106
Don't people die fast enough
without destroying each other?

908
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,942
Is life too long?

909
00:50:25,025 --> 00:50:26,360
Sponge.

910
00:50:26,944 --> 00:50:30,948
No, we mustn't ask that.
That's not scientific.

911
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:36,578
I wonder how scientific those still
heaps out there on the battlefield feel.

912
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,957
Guns, machines, men, so much rubbish.

913
00:50:41,124 --> 00:50:43,168
What was it in my student days?

914
00:50:43,252 --> 00:50:48,340
Chemically, a man is worth
97 cents. Probably $1.05.

915
00:50:48,841 --> 00:50:51,885
What, with the shortage
of parts and monopoly now,

916
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:53,846
the dead have risen in value.

917
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:57,307
Two for $1.98 on Dollar Day.

918
00:50:57,474 --> 00:50:58,767
Doctor, the patient.

919
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,270
We've done all we can for her.

920
00:51:01,353 --> 00:51:05,607
She will die soon of a bullet
wound she received two days ago.

921
00:51:05,649 --> 00:51:09,444
When the baby started to come,
it was too much for her. Tie.

922
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,700
Now where were we in the lecture?

923
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:19,121
This little fellow we're about
to introduce to the world tonight.

924
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,832
What for him? I don't know.

925
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:25,961
They forgot to teach me
about spirit somewhere.

926
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:30,465
Ninety-seven cents worth of
body, but a priceless spirit.

927
00:51:51,069 --> 00:51:53,572
May he be born to live in freedom.

928
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:01,830
And then Superman, with one
hand, held the streamliner,

929
00:52:01,914 --> 00:52:03,457
and with the other one,
tore down the bridge

930
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,834
and thus saved the
life of his sweetheart.

931
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,423
My translator.

932
00:52:15,093 --> 00:52:18,347
She wants to know if Superman
is so good, why isn't he here?

933
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:19,598
She would.

934
00:52:19,681 --> 00:52:22,976
Tell her he just landed with
the Marines. We call him Kansas.

935
00:52:24,186 --> 00:52:25,354
Miss Davidson? Yes?

936
00:52:25,437 --> 00:52:26,522
Here's your list. Thanks.

937
00:52:26,605 --> 00:52:28,607
I've assigned your girls.
I'll see you in the morning.

938
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:31,235
D'Arcy with the Japanese
wounded! What is it?

939
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:42,955
Olivia.

940
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:44,873
Olivia.

941
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,253
It's all right. I couldn't do it.

942
00:52:50,212 --> 00:52:52,923
I didn't have the guts to, I suppose.

943
00:52:53,298 --> 00:52:55,926
I couldn't kill even a wounded rat.

944
00:52:56,176 --> 00:52:58,762
There's no reason to worry.
I was just a little silly.

945
00:52:58,846 --> 00:53:00,681
Don't you think it would
be better if I took over?

946
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:04,768
No, not at all. There's nothing
wrong here. Is there, Olivia?

947
00:53:05,143 --> 00:53:06,353
No.

948
00:53:06,436 --> 00:53:08,397
You don't want anyone
to relieve you now?

949
00:53:08,438 --> 00:53:09,690
No.

950
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,650
Right. I'll see you later.

951
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:20,868
We soon found out how right
McGregor was about wearing whites.

952
00:53:20,951 --> 00:53:23,954
The next day the quartermaster
gave us some men's coveralls

953
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:26,123
as well as their shoes and underwear.

954
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:27,749
It seemed as if no man in the Army

955
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:30,544
wore anything smaller than size 46.

956
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:40,470
Look at that, how big this is!

957
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,932
She's in trouble.

958
00:53:43,974 --> 00:53:46,059
Pull. Want some help?

959
00:53:47,644 --> 00:53:49,688
The next couple of
weeks were misleading,

960
00:53:49,771 --> 00:53:52,274
as the pressure from the
enemy got to be routine to us

961
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:55,777
and the wounded kept pouring
in from the daily engagements.

962
00:53:55,819 --> 00:53:59,031
But the most terrible thing was our
medical supplies were beginning to run low.

963
00:53:59,114 --> 00:54:00,240
You got morphine?

964
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,784
And the same food over and over,

965
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:05,329
carabao meat, tea and a bit of rice.

966
00:54:05,496 --> 00:54:07,456
Occasionally, we got a mule steak.

967
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:10,125
It was so stubborn it
stuck in your throat.

968
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:14,463
Most of us slept in GI
underwear, except Joan,

969
00:54:14,546 --> 00:54:18,091
who had clung desperately
to her black silk nightgown.

970
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:21,011
Good morning, sunshine.

971
00:54:21,094 --> 00:54:22,596
Good morning, Joan.

972
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:25,265
Hello. Hi.

973
00:54:25,724 --> 00:54:27,684
You know, she's gonna
wear that black nightgown

974
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:29,770
right up to the Pearly Gates.

975
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:32,856
She says it keeps her
morale up, and it does.

976
00:54:33,524 --> 00:54:35,484
You tired? I'm numb.

977
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:39,029
And do my feet hurt.

978
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:43,492
If I didn't see mine from time to
time, I wouldn't know I had them.

979
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:45,285
You know that little Filipino scout

980
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:47,329
with the abdomen wound's
gonna be all right.

981
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:50,541
Swell. You're doing a grand job, Livvie.

982
00:54:51,208 --> 00:54:52,668
Who isn't?

983
00:54:53,043 --> 00:54:54,044
Thanks, Davy.

984
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:56,004
For what?

985
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,007
I can't say it exactly.

986
00:54:59,091 --> 00:55:02,219
But for what you did,
setting me straight, I mean.

987
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,680
You set yourself straight.

988
00:55:04,721 --> 00:55:08,308
You were so right in letting
me fight it out for myself.

989
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,602
I guess if you work long enough

990
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:12,646
and hard enough, you do forget.

991
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,606
Almost.

992
00:55:15,858 --> 00:55:17,317
You wanna talk about him?

993
00:55:18,068 --> 00:55:19,069
No. No point.

994
00:55:20,028 --> 00:55:23,532
At least I don't want to die
anymore. I have too much to do.

995
00:55:23,615 --> 00:55:24,867
You never did, really.

996
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:28,162
Yes, I did. There didn't
seem to be anything left.

997
00:55:30,747 --> 00:55:32,958
I think I know how you feel.

998
00:55:34,793 --> 00:55:37,171
Worried about your lieutenant?

999
00:55:37,588 --> 00:55:40,757
I haven't heard a thing
since we left the boat.

1000
00:55:44,344 --> 00:55:46,722
Out, everybody, out! Emergency!

1001
00:55:48,098 --> 00:55:51,310
Oh, no, you take a nap. I'll
call you later. Come on, girls.

1002
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:53,562
Emergency, Joan. What's up?

1003
00:55:53,979 --> 00:55:56,899
It looks like another convoy
of wounded. Come up to surgery.

1004
00:55:56,982 --> 00:55:58,233
Right.

1005
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:06,658
I've got an emergency of my own.

1006
00:56:07,910 --> 00:56:10,871
There's no use, Colonel. I
can't take any more wounded.

1007
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:12,456
I'm sure we have no more beds.

1008
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:13,832
You've gotta do something, Ma.

1009
00:56:13,916 --> 00:56:15,792
I'll run over to the
jungle hospital tomorrow.

1010
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:17,211
Maybe I can steal some there.

1011
00:56:17,252 --> 00:56:18,587
Hello, Colonel White. Hello, Joan.

1012
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:19,922
How many empty beds have we?

1013
00:56:19,963 --> 00:56:20,964
We have none.

1014
00:56:21,924 --> 00:56:24,676
Schwartz, you better get over to
surgery. Yes, Captain McGregor.

1015
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,261
Davidson, take over
in my office, will you?

1016
00:56:26,345 --> 00:56:28,055
Did I hear the name Davidson? Yes.

1017
00:56:28,138 --> 00:56:31,683
Janet, this is my son, Flight
Lieutenant Archie McGregor.

1018
00:56:31,767 --> 00:56:33,727
How do you do? Flying
with the infantry now.

1019
00:56:33,811 --> 00:56:37,231
How did that happen? We just
got caught with our planes down.

1020
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:39,399
I've heard quite a lot
about you from John Summers.

1021
00:56:39,483 --> 00:56:40,943
John? Well, where is he?

1022
00:56:40,984 --> 00:56:43,278
In the mess hall. Thank you.

1023
00:56:46,615 --> 00:56:49,076
John! John!

1024
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:03,131
Hiya, Davy.

1025
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:04,633
Hello, darling.

1026
00:57:06,176 --> 00:57:08,345
Say, feels better without the whiskers.

1027
00:57:08,428 --> 00:57:10,264
You finished? Yes.
Did you get some sleep?

1028
00:57:10,305 --> 00:57:12,975
Best I've ever had.
You're a perfect sedative.

1029
00:57:13,392 --> 00:57:15,394
Well, let's call a taxi.
Where's the nearest nightclub?

1030
00:57:15,477 --> 00:57:16,979
No, you're going for a walk.

1031
00:57:17,229 --> 00:57:19,106
A walk I've taken so many times,

1032
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:21,316
talking to you even
though you weren't there.

1033
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,318
No taxis tonight.

1034
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:28,991
Have you seen Miss Davidson?

1035
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:31,994
Well, she finished her duty about
15 minutes ago and then said...

1036
00:57:32,035 --> 00:57:34,496
No, that wasn't her. We
haven't seen her at all.

1037
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:36,999
If you see her, tell her I want
her to report to me immediately.

1038
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,375
Yes, Ma.

1039
00:57:39,126 --> 00:57:41,378
This? It keeps up my morale.

1040
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:52,848
This is it, the Bataan river.

1041
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:57,686
You wouldn't even know
there's a war going on here.

1042
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,480
That was the idea.

1043
00:58:02,524 --> 00:58:04,401
Darling, was it terrible up there?

1044
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:06,153
It wasn't pretty.

1045
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:09,615
We're so outnumbered. Sometimes
the Jap losses are 300 to one.

1046
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:11,783
Still they kept pouring them in.

1047
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,744
Their dive bombers are the worst.

1048
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,455
Up and down every road
all day, all night.

1049
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:18,790
Those Filipino scouts and our poor guys

1050
00:58:18,874 --> 00:58:21,543
sleeping on their
rifles and machine guns.

1051
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:24,171
The bravest men I've ever even heard of.

1052
00:58:24,254 --> 00:58:25,714
They must be.

1053
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:28,175
They don't give quarter
and they don't ask for any.

1054
00:58:28,258 --> 00:58:29,635
I can't figure it out.

1055
00:58:29,718 --> 00:58:30,886
Figure what?

1056
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:32,137
Why they do it.

1057
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:35,390
There's something other than
just fighting against the Japs.

1058
00:58:35,432 --> 00:58:38,393
These fellows aren't
a bit afraid to die.

1059
00:58:39,895 --> 00:58:43,774
That's our air raid signal. Come
on, there's a trench over there.

1060
00:58:55,035 --> 00:58:58,747
This is the only nice thing the
Japs have done so far in this war.

1061
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:00,040
Oh, look.

1062
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,379
You see, we have nothing but the best.

1063
00:59:05,629 --> 00:59:08,465
You know, sometimes I
thought you might forget me.

1064
00:59:08,549 --> 00:59:09,716
I tried to.

1065
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,218
You did? What for?

1066
00:59:12,261 --> 00:59:14,263
Because you troubled me so much.

1067
00:59:14,346 --> 00:59:15,639
I'm sorry.

1068
00:59:16,807 --> 00:59:20,936
Everything that happens,
everything I do, you're part of.

1069
00:59:21,019 --> 00:59:23,063
I can't get you out of my mind.

1070
00:59:23,147 --> 00:59:24,231
Don't try.

1071
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:27,484
I'm not going to anymore.

1072
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,074
Here's the reconnaissance, I guess.

1073
00:59:36,243 --> 00:59:38,745
What are you looking
at me like that for?

1074
00:59:38,829 --> 00:59:41,290
I want to remember exactly how you look.

1075
00:59:41,832 --> 00:59:44,918
You know, sometimes, I couldn't
even remember the color of your eyes.

1076
00:59:45,002 --> 00:59:46,670
Your whole face was hazy.

1077
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:48,922
That's when I look my best.

1078
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:52,301
Thank God I had you to
think about out there.

1079
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:54,052
I still don't think you should go back.

1080
00:59:54,136 --> 00:59:56,638
Hey, you know better than that.

1081
00:59:57,806 --> 01:00:00,559
I have a feeling that if you go
back, I'll never see you again.

1082
01:00:00,642 --> 01:00:03,604
Don't worry. Believe me, I'll
take care of myself for you.

1083
01:00:03,687 --> 01:00:05,898
Now promise you won't worry.

1084
01:00:07,024 --> 01:00:09,985
I promise. But I'll worry.

1085
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:17,409
That's the all-clear.

1086
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:20,829
Well, I guess we'd better get back.

1087
01:01:15,551 --> 01:01:17,094
Irma, what's up?

1088
01:01:17,177 --> 01:01:18,262
We've got orders to evacuate.

1089
01:01:18,345 --> 01:01:19,346
Are they that close?

1090
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:22,558
I don't know. We've just been
told to clear out of here.

1091
01:01:23,142 --> 01:01:25,018
Captain McGregor, how close are they?

1092
01:01:25,102 --> 01:01:26,854
Where have you been?
I told you to report.

1093
01:01:26,895 --> 01:01:28,897
I wasn't able to get back.
But what I want to know...

1094
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:31,942
Davidson, I discovered you went
out with Lieutenant Summers.

1095
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,736
I'm warning you. If there's a
repetition of anything like this,

1096
01:01:34,778 --> 01:01:38,824
I shall order you to pack up and
recommend a dishonorable discharge.

1097
01:01:38,907 --> 01:01:41,451
As a girl whose people have
been in the Army all their lives,

1098
01:01:41,535 --> 01:01:43,787
you wouldn't want that to happen.

1099
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:46,248
No, I wouldn't. Thank you, Captain.

1100
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:48,917
Okay, then we'll forget
the whole incident.

1101
01:01:49,001 --> 01:01:51,170
Now, I've orders here
to evacuate the hospital.

1102
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:53,672
We've got to be out by tonight
so we can destroy the base.

1103
01:01:53,755 --> 01:01:55,591
The demolition squad will
be here in eight hours

1104
01:01:55,674 --> 01:01:57,718
so that's how much time we've got.

1105
01:01:57,759 --> 01:01:59,094
After the patients have been evacuated,

1106
01:01:59,136 --> 01:02:00,429
you'd better get the surgery out.

1107
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:02,181
I'll take care of that.

1108
01:02:04,975 --> 01:02:07,978
What are you doing
here? Come on. Look out!

1109
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,276
Joan, they were out in the street.

1110
01:02:14,359 --> 01:02:15,986
Stay here and take her.

1111
01:02:16,069 --> 01:02:19,114
Listen, I'm gonna beat your brains
out if you don't stay around here.

1112
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:20,616
My sister had... I
don't care what she had.

1113
01:02:20,699 --> 01:02:22,534
You stay here. Now, mind.

1114
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:24,244
Hey!

1115
01:02:25,662 --> 01:02:27,456
What's the matter with you?
Do you wanna kill us all?

1116
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:28,957
I've got some passengers for you.

1117
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,586
But I'm in a hurry. They're in
a hurry, too. Get in there fast.

1118
01:02:33,504 --> 01:02:35,839
Here you are. Now, you
take care of your sister.

1119
01:02:35,923 --> 01:02:37,799
Take them away, Stevie.

1120
01:02:37,883 --> 01:02:39,510
Is this Superman? He'd better be.

1121
01:02:39,593 --> 01:02:41,261
Go on! On your way, toots.

1122
01:02:41,345 --> 01:02:43,388
On your way!

1123
01:02:46,517 --> 01:02:47,684
We've been ordered to evacuate,

1124
01:02:47,768 --> 01:02:49,645
we've got to get the
surgery to Little Baguio.

1125
01:02:49,728 --> 01:02:52,189
We can't leave yet, there are
more cases I know I can save.

1126
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:53,273
But we've been ordered.

1127
01:02:53,357 --> 01:02:55,818
I know but I must have
a little more time.

1128
01:03:01,481 --> 01:03:03,025
Just a minute.

1129
01:03:06,108 --> 01:03:08,027
All right,
we're ready.

1130
01:03:10,156 --> 01:03:13,242
Hey, kids, see you later.
Goodbye.

1131
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:15,905
I think we'd better be
getting along, Lieutenant.

1132
01:03:16,055 --> 01:03:17,222
I guess this is about it.

1133
01:03:17,212 --> 01:03:18,964
We've heard some rifle fire
not so very far back.

1134
01:03:19,062 --> 01:03:20,856
The demolition squad
isn't even here.

1135
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:23,821
Sounds like a Jap
patrol has infiltrated through.

1136
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,213
Come on, girls, get in,
hurry up.

1137
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:26,236
I forgot something.
I'll be right back.

1138
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:27,933
No, Joan! Come back here.
You haven't time!

1139
01:03:27,969 --> 01:03:29,429
Let's get started.

1140
01:03:29,588 --> 01:03:31,924
She'll be back in a minute.
Joan!

1141
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:40,028
- Joan!
- Come on, Joan! Hurry up!

1142
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,358
We've gotta get going!

1143
01:03:42,774 --> 01:03:45,360
I'm coming.
Hurry up and get in.

1144
01:03:49,252 --> 01:03:52,297
Get in the house!
Come on! Hurry up!

1145
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:04,164
Get him in! Close the
door and put the light out.

1146
01:04:06,602 --> 01:04:08,062
Davy, I'm sorry, Davy.

1147
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:11,067
Never mind that now.
Get down low, all of you.

1148
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,852
He's dead.

1149
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,195
Do you think they'll miss us, do you
think they'll send someone for us?

1150
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:21,501
- Of course they will.
- What are we gonna do?

1151
01:04:21,638 --> 01:04:23,056
We'll get out
of this somehow.

1152
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:25,019
I know what I'm gonna do.

1153
01:04:25,108 --> 01:04:27,485
If somebody doesn't come,
we'd better all kill ourselves.

1154
01:04:27,537 --> 01:04:30,165
But why? Somebody's coming,
Davy said somebody's coming.

1155
01:04:30,198 --> 01:04:33,326
I was in Nanking. I saw what
happened to the women there.

1156
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,645
Keep quiet.

1157
01:04:34,709 --> 01:04:36,752
When the Red Cross protested,
the Japanese called it,

1158
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:39,418
"The privilege of serving His
Imperial Majesty's troops."

1159
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:41,819
It's an honor,
an honor you die from.

1160
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,381
Stop that nonsense,
do you hear?

1161
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:45,469
I've seen them fight
over a woman like dogs.

1162
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:46,916
Stop it!

1163
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:56,121
Here's a grenade.
Maybe we could get them...

1164
01:04:56,223 --> 01:04:57,433
Here, give me that.

1165
01:04:57,495 --> 01:04:58,663
If we threw a grenade
and missed,

1166
01:04:58,768 --> 01:05:01,020
it would mean sure death for
all of us, we might kill one...

1167
01:05:01,081 --> 01:05:02,625
Stop talking about killing.

1168
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,602
Now, look. I want you all to stay here.

1169
01:05:05,592 --> 01:05:07,302
I'm going out
to start that truck.

1170
01:05:07,443 --> 01:05:08,569
As soon as you hear
the motor running,

1171
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:12,270
make a dash for it,
it's our only chance.

1172
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,088
Now don't be frightened.

1173
01:05:15,192 --> 01:05:17,278
I'm gonna throw this grenade
in the opposite direction

1174
01:05:17,274 --> 01:05:18,733
to try to divert
their attention.

1175
01:05:18,894 --> 01:05:21,688
Don't go, Davy, don't go. Be quiet.

1176
01:05:32,427 --> 01:05:34,804
One, two, three, four.

1177
01:06:28,757 --> 01:06:30,718
Livvie! Livvie,
come back here!

1178
01:06:30,723 --> 01:06:32,600
Come here!
Livvie!

1179
01:06:41,249 --> 01:06:42,583
Olivia!

1180
01:06:46,107 --> 01:06:48,859
Goodbye, Davy.
Thanks for everything.

1181
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:50,657
Get back in the surgery!

1182
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:52,985
No, it's our only chance.

1183
01:06:53,047 --> 01:06:56,759
We can't get through.
It's one of us or all of us.

1184
01:06:58,367 --> 01:06:59,993
Throw it away!

1185
01:07:00,102 --> 01:07:03,230
It's too late.
Goodbye, Davy.

1186
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,623
Oh, no! Olivia!

1187
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:13,365
Olivia!
Livvie!

1188
01:07:38,273 --> 01:07:40,484
Out! Everybody, out! Hurry!

1189
01:07:58,630 --> 01:08:01,049
After a nerve-wracking trip
through the jungle,

1190
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:04,094
we arrived at our new base,
the jungle hospital,

1191
01:08:04,182 --> 01:08:08,311
which was officially known as
"Hospital Kilometer 163,5".

1192
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:12,544
But it was no hospital at all.
It was just jungle.

1193
01:08:12,973 --> 01:08:14,557
The beds were placed
under canvasses,

1194
01:08:14,592 --> 01:08:17,345
which kept the sun off
the more serious cases.

1195
01:08:17,484 --> 01:08:18,527
But it was so overcrowded

1196
01:08:18,525 --> 01:08:21,403
that many of the beds were
just placed out under the trees,

1197
01:08:21,532 --> 01:08:24,493
which at least kept them
hidden from the Jap planes.

1198
01:08:24,539 --> 01:08:27,417
Nineteen wards were
set up in this way.

1199
01:08:27,431 --> 01:08:30,809
Each ward had a capacity
of 200 or 300 patients,

1200
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:32,611
and this was increased
until we had

1201
01:08:32,636 --> 01:08:35,263
between 5, 000
and 8, 000 of them.

1202
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:38,429
Most of the patients began
to be not wounded,

1203
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:41,757
but men coming down
with malaria and dysentery.

1204
01:08:42,005 --> 01:08:44,465
A little one-cylinder engine
provided the electricity

1205
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:47,511
for the main operating room,
which was just a tent

1206
01:08:47,557 --> 01:08:50,893
and we sterilized our instruments
in three large garbage cans,

1207
01:08:50,912 --> 01:08:53,623
one with soapy water
and two with boiling water.

1208
01:08:53,688 --> 01:08:57,566
We kept washing and rewashing the
dressings after they'd been used.

1209
01:08:57,620 --> 01:08:59,413
In our flight from Limay,

1210
01:08:59,587 --> 01:09:02,590
Rosemary had received
a nasty gash on the forehead.

1211
01:09:02,594 --> 01:09:05,013
But under the healing hands
of Jose,

1212
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:07,683
she escaped
with only a slight scar.

1213
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:11,551
And as the weeks went by,
we were so busy we had no time

1214
01:09:11,616 --> 01:09:13,701
to think about
what happened to Olivia

1215
01:09:13,698 --> 01:09:17,868
and even Joan seemed to be convinced
eventually that it wasn't her fault.

1216
01:09:17,978 --> 01:09:21,815
We were among the first to use
powdered sulphanilamide on open wounds.

1217
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,662
It worked wonders.

1218
01:09:23,761 --> 01:09:26,430
We called ourselves "the
battling orphans of Bataan.

1219
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,915
"No father, no mother,
no Uncle Sam. "

1220
01:09:28,966 --> 01:09:31,594
As we wondered
where the reinforcements were.

1221
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:34,504
But even so,
we continued to hope.

1222
01:09:34,749 --> 01:09:38,836
Some of us got malaria, too,
fevers of 104 and 105.

1223
01:09:39,145 --> 01:09:40,730
But there was
no time for coddling.

1224
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,924
The soldiers were
the patients.

1225
01:09:42,962 --> 01:09:44,297
How are you, Irma?

1226
01:09:44,697 --> 01:09:46,032
I'm all right.

1227
01:09:46,779 --> 01:09:49,073
Here, take your quinine.
There isn't time.

1228
01:09:49,208 --> 01:09:50,626
Take time.

1229
01:09:51,637 --> 01:09:52,972
Come on.

1230
01:09:56,264 --> 01:09:58,224
Here, take some water.

1231
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,142
Guess I'd better
take some, too.

1232
01:10:03,319 --> 01:10:05,279
I don't know which
is the worst.

1233
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,947
Davy was in charge
of the jungle hospital

1234
01:10:11,994 --> 01:10:14,496
as McGregor had her
headquarters at Little Baguio,

1235
01:10:14,539 --> 01:10:17,333
which was another base
about four kilometers away.

1236
01:10:17,315 --> 01:10:18,941
She had thrown herself
into her work,

1237
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:21,010
with John constantly
on her mind,

1238
01:10:21,132 --> 01:10:23,009
although one never
would have known it.

1239
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:24,391
The only contact
between them

1240
01:10:24,486 --> 01:10:27,823
was a little monkey John had
sent one day by a wounded soldier.

1241
01:10:27,841 --> 01:10:30,719
He quickly became
the pet of the company.

1242
01:10:36,631 --> 01:10:40,134
We called him Tojo because
they looked so much alike.

1243
01:10:41,374 --> 01:10:42,918
Give me those.

1244
01:10:52,478 --> 01:10:53,688
Hey, did you hear the news?

1245
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:57,587
Supplies and reinforcements.
There's a big convoy on the way.

1246
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:02,929
Friends, I want you to meet
my own private little army.

1247
01:11:03,003 --> 01:11:04,713
These guys' names are Joe.

1248
01:11:04,738 --> 01:11:07,741
Me Joe, too. Me Joe, too. Hiya, Joe.

1249
01:11:07,861 --> 01:11:11,282
Incidentally, these babies are the
sweetest fighters you ever seen in action.

1250
01:11:11,332 --> 01:11:14,794
Me Joe, too. Him Joe,
too. Yeah, me Joe, too.

1251
01:11:16,652 --> 01:11:19,989
I been over to Cebu and I
got some mail for all of you.

1252
01:11:24,286 --> 01:11:26,997
Hey, look what I got
a Sears, Roebuck catalog!

1253
01:11:27,062 --> 01:11:29,565
This big box is
for you, Rosemary.

1254
01:11:32,267 --> 01:11:34,603
I bet it's a cake. Remember
the cake we had on the boat?

1255
01:11:34,696 --> 01:11:35,947
You're the only one
who remembers,

1256
01:11:35,969 --> 01:11:38,638
you're the only one
that ate it.

1257
01:11:38,745 --> 01:11:42,833
Okay, Joe, see if you can find
yourself some chow. Pronto.

1258
01:11:44,644 --> 01:11:46,104
Hello.
Hi.

1259
01:11:46,147 --> 01:11:47,482
You big bum!

1260
01:11:47,767 --> 01:11:49,311
You always say
what I expect.

1261
01:11:49,386 --> 01:11:50,888
Isn't that nice?
Yes.

1262
01:11:51,005 --> 01:11:53,049
Say, what are you
doing here anyway?

1263
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,380
I got some mail for you.

1264
01:11:54,475 --> 01:11:55,976
Thanks, pal.

1265
01:11:58,177 --> 01:11:59,679
They're open.

1266
01:12:00,027 --> 01:12:02,613
I guess those censors
must've run out of glue.

1267
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:04,607
Kansas, have you been
reading my mail?

1268
01:12:04,770 --> 01:12:07,189
Well, I had to read
myself to sleep, didn't I?

1269
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:09,493
You don't want to deprive me
of my sleep, do you?

1270
01:12:09,628 --> 01:12:12,089
Anyway, I didn't
read all of them.

1271
01:12:12,172 --> 01:12:15,050
Very dull, most of them.
Very dull!

1272
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:16,899
I'm terribly sorry.

1273
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:20,826
Except this Dr. O'Leary. He's
rather a cute guy, ain't he?

1274
01:12:20,847 --> 01:12:22,057
He is.

1275
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:25,415
He writes with that
real literary style.

1276
01:12:26,747 --> 01:12:27,873
What's he to you?

1277
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:30,405
Well, since you read them,
dear, you ought to know.

1278
01:12:35,537 --> 01:12:38,165
If it's a cake,
I hope it's chocolate.

1279
01:12:39,701 --> 01:12:42,454
It's a hat.
Who can eat a hat?

1280
01:12:42,593 --> 01:12:44,845
I don't care.
It looks good enough to eat.

1281
01:12:44,906 --> 01:12:46,241
Say, is there
any mail for me?

1282
01:12:46,294 --> 01:12:48,296
Davy, isn't it wonderful?

1283
01:12:48,376 --> 01:12:50,544
Well, it's pretty cute.
A little impractical.

1284
01:12:50,574 --> 01:12:51,825
No, I mean the news.

1285
01:12:51,962 --> 01:12:53,005
What news?

1286
01:12:53,003 --> 01:12:54,922
There's a convoy, Davy!

1287
01:12:56,242 --> 01:12:57,660
Are you sure?
Who told you?

1288
01:12:57,630 --> 01:12:59,256
Kansas just came back
from Cebu with the news.

1289
01:12:59,365 --> 01:13:01,367
Yeah, and that hat.
We're going to celebrate.

1290
01:13:01,447 --> 01:13:04,533
Davy, could I speak to
you for a minute? Yeah.

1291
01:13:07,577 --> 01:13:11,039
I thought you'd like to know Ma
McGregor's son's been wounded, he's here.

1292
01:13:11,163 --> 01:13:12,205
Serious?

1293
01:13:12,204 --> 01:13:13,997
I haven't seen him.
I was just told he was here.

1294
01:13:14,170 --> 01:13:15,212
Thanks, Irma.

1295
01:13:15,211 --> 01:13:17,296
It's tough on the old battle
ax. Only boy, isn't he?

1296
01:13:17,409 --> 01:13:19,619
Yeah. I think
I'd better phone her.

1297
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:33,878
Davy. Davy.

1298
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:38,934
John.

1299
01:13:38,923 --> 01:13:40,508
I told you I'd be back.

1300
01:13:40,658 --> 01:13:43,661
For a minute I thought
I was hearing voices.

1301
01:13:45,169 --> 01:13:46,253
How long are you
going to be here?

1302
01:13:46,326 --> 01:13:48,828
Till morning.
How are you, darling?

1303
01:13:48,870 --> 01:13:51,039
I'm all right.

1304
01:13:51,184 --> 01:13:52,769
You look pretty tired.

1305
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:56,153
I'm sort of glad there
aren't 25 hours in the day.

1306
01:13:56,157 --> 01:13:57,701
The news is wonderful,
though, isn't it?

1307
01:13:57,777 --> 01:13:58,862
Wonderful.

1308
01:13:59,049 --> 01:14:01,593
I came over with Ma.
How's the boy?

1309
01:14:02,866 --> 01:14:05,118
His legs have
been amputated.

1310
01:14:05,642 --> 01:14:07,560
Both of them?

1311
01:14:07,493 --> 01:14:09,704
There was nothing else
they could do.

1312
01:14:10,384 --> 01:14:11,844
Here she is.

1313
01:14:12,929 --> 01:14:14,680
He's been calling for you.

1314
01:14:14,664 --> 01:14:15,748
How is he?

1315
01:14:36,756 --> 01:14:38,258
Hello, Son.

1316
01:14:40,226 --> 01:14:41,560
Hello, Mother.

1317
01:14:41,614 --> 01:14:42,907
How do you feel?

1318
01:14:44,159 --> 01:14:46,036
I'm gonna be all right.

1319
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:49,211
Fine thing to waste
an $18,000 pilot

1320
01:14:49,248 --> 01:14:51,375
getting wounded
with the infantry.

1321
01:14:53,875 --> 01:14:58,630
A pain, in my toes. I got
a terrible cramp, I guess.

1322
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:04,863
No, not that one, Mother.
The other one.

1323
01:15:04,979 --> 01:15:06,230
Oh, darling!

1324
01:15:08,102 --> 01:15:10,729
What's the matter?
Hey, what's the matter, Ma?

1325
01:15:10,763 --> 01:15:11,931
Lie down, dear.
No.

1326
01:15:12,035 --> 01:15:14,955
Lie down. No, I want
to see. I want to...

1327
01:15:15,274 --> 01:15:17,652
Ma, my legs.
Where's my legs?

1328
01:15:18,628 --> 01:15:21,881
Ma, they promised me.
They've taken away my legs.

1329
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:23,160
Archie, darling.

1330
01:15:23,255 --> 01:15:24,673
No. No.

1331
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:39,332
You all right?
Yes.

1332
01:15:40,605 --> 01:15:43,733
For a minute, I thought
I was going to be sick.

1333
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:46,266
Hold me, hold me close.

1334
01:15:50,899 --> 01:15:52,901
I'm horrible, I know,

1335
01:15:53,328 --> 01:15:55,455
but all the time
I just kept thinking of you.

1336
01:15:55,757 --> 01:15:58,885
Hey, take it easy.
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

1337
01:16:27,103 --> 01:16:28,980
Nurse. Miss Davidson.

1338
01:16:35,894 --> 01:16:36,978
Ma.

1339
01:16:52,087 --> 01:16:58,134
"O sovereign Lord, who desireth
not the death of a sinner,

1340
01:16:59,143 --> 01:17:04,148
"We beseech thee to loose the
spirit of this, thy servant,

1341
01:17:04,232 --> 01:17:07,277
"and set him free
from all evil

1342
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:15,045
"that he may rest with all thy
saints in the eternal habitations."

1343
01:17:16,377 --> 01:17:18,087
Do you want
a drink of water?

1344
01:17:18,112 --> 01:17:19,656
No, thank you, Davy.

1345
01:17:20,194 --> 01:17:22,321
Lie down for a moment.

1346
01:17:22,392 --> 01:17:23,852
No, it's all over.

1347
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,775
He never saw his father,

1348
01:17:28,869 --> 01:17:30,787
and his son
will never see him.

1349
01:17:32,108 --> 01:17:33,777
He has a child?

1350
01:17:34,074 --> 01:17:35,534
Three months old.

1351
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:39,529
It's a pattern that
will go on, I suppose,

1352
01:17:39,511 --> 01:17:42,973
until we do make the world
a decent place to live in.

1353
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,710
Well, I guess
we can go now.

1354
01:17:53,275 --> 01:17:57,279
Thank you, Davy. I'm glad you
called me so I could be here.

1355
01:17:57,902 --> 01:17:59,945
I can't say anything, Ma.

1356
01:18:00,331 --> 01:18:02,709
What can you say?
What can I say?

1357
01:18:03,916 --> 01:18:06,044
I bore a son
and he's dead.

1358
01:18:06,808 --> 01:18:11,104
I bore a son, a healthy,
muscular child who was a good son.

1359
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:15,442
It used to break my heart just to
look at him, he was so beautiful.

1360
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:18,486
The handsomest son
in the world

1361
01:18:18,606 --> 01:18:21,108
and now I have
no heart to break.

1362
01:18:23,117 --> 01:18:26,454
Like his father, he died
for what he knew was right.

1363
01:18:26,934 --> 01:18:30,604
He was right, my son
and his father

1364
01:18:30,635 --> 01:18:33,889
and this time,
if we don't make it right,

1365
01:18:34,105 --> 01:18:38,609
my son and his father and all our
dead will rise up and destroy us.

1366
01:18:55,504 --> 01:18:58,549
I'm sending McGregor
to Corregidor,

1367
01:18:58,627 --> 01:19:01,964
so I want you and your staff to
report to Little Baguio in the morning,

1368
01:19:01,981 --> 01:19:03,482
take over in her place.

1369
01:19:03,485 --> 01:19:04,820
Yes, sir.

1370
01:19:05,451 --> 01:19:08,454
Do you know if there are any
nurses coming on the convoy?

1371
01:19:08,574 --> 01:19:10,076
What convoy?

1372
01:19:11,003 --> 01:19:14,340
What convoy? The one we've
been celebrating all day.

1373
01:19:14,473 --> 01:19:17,643
There isn't any convoy.
It's been sunk.

1374
01:19:18,753 --> 01:19:19,963
There've been
desperate measures taken

1375
01:19:20,025 --> 01:19:22,319
to get others through to us,

1376
01:19:22,339 --> 01:19:25,092
but only a few small vessels
have succeeded.

1377
01:19:25,115 --> 01:19:27,117
Not enough to mean much.

1378
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,323
Is it as bad as all that?

1379
01:19:33,558 --> 01:19:35,518
MacArthur left tonight.

1380
01:19:37,722 --> 01:19:41,518
Left Bataan? He was ordered
off. He's gone to Australia.

1381
01:19:41,886 --> 01:19:43,220
But why?

1382
01:19:44,084 --> 01:19:46,962
Because he's needed more there
than he is here, I guess.

1383
01:19:46,976 --> 01:19:48,852
He didn't want to go.

1384
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53,614
Well, maybe I better
tell the others.

1385
01:19:53,685 --> 01:19:55,812
No, don't do
anything about it.

1386
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,667
A good evening
of relaxation might help.

1387
01:20:00,740 --> 01:20:04,201
What they don't know
won't hurt them.

1388
01:20:04,326 --> 01:20:05,786
No, I suppose not.

1389
01:20:06,755 --> 01:20:08,548
Especially when
what they do know does.

1390
01:20:11,613 --> 01:20:14,199
Good night, Janet.
Good night, sir.

1391
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,217
Little Baguio, which was
another hospital base,

1392
01:20:28,385 --> 01:20:30,762
was high up
in the Mariveles mountains.

1393
01:20:30,814 --> 01:20:33,734
It had been bombed
some days before we arrived.

1394
01:20:33,705 --> 01:20:36,291
The emperor himself
apologized for the bombing.

1395
01:20:36,828 --> 01:20:38,121
"So sorry."

1396
01:20:38,795 --> 01:20:41,465
When we got there, Davy
made us make a huge cross

1397
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:43,740
with tarpaulins
in front of the wards.

1398
01:20:43,768 --> 01:20:47,689
She gave them the benefit of the
doubt, though even she didn't doubt.

1399
01:20:47,817 --> 01:20:49,777
Do you think
this will do any good, Davy?

1400
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:53,329
I don't know. Perhaps we're only
providing them with an easier target.

1401
01:20:55,104 --> 01:20:57,523
I don't know whether that's
an air raid warning or mess.

1402
01:20:57,533 --> 01:20:58,993
Either way,
it's a warning.

1403
01:20:59,036 --> 01:21:01,705
Come on, kids,
let's go eat our slop.

1404
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:09,191
What's the matter, Ethel?

1405
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:12,668
I'm all right. Too
much rich food, I guess.

1406
01:21:12,801 --> 01:21:14,552
Who's in the children's ward?

1407
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,414
Joan. She said she didn't
mind doing my shift.

1408
01:21:17,543 --> 01:21:19,754
Come on. You need some
rest. I'll take care of her.

1409
01:21:19,857 --> 01:21:21,609
Thanks, Patterson.

1410
01:21:23,905 --> 01:21:26,157
I don't know how she does it. Who?

1411
01:21:26,218 --> 01:21:28,845
Joan. She doesn't ever
seem to get any sleep.

1412
01:21:28,879 --> 01:21:31,215
I've never seen
anybody do so much.

1413
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:35,945
I'm worried about her. Something
seems to be driving her on.

1414
01:21:35,934 --> 01:21:40,272
Go over and give her a hand, will
you, Sadie? I'll relieve you later.

1415
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:47,973
That's really hitting
below the belt.

1416
01:21:53,516 --> 01:21:55,810
Davy! Davy!

1417
01:22:05,892 --> 01:22:07,977
What happened to her?
She fainted.

1418
01:22:07,974 --> 01:22:11,144
I've warned her.
Joan. Joan!

1419
01:22:14,336 --> 01:22:17,923
No, no, no. You stay down
there now. Sadie'll take over.

1420
01:22:18,037 --> 01:22:20,831
Nobody's going to take over
for me. I feel fine now.

1421
01:22:20,813 --> 01:22:22,231
Joan, don't.

1422
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:24,611
What you need is some sleep.
That's what's wrong with you.

1423
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:27,258
I can't sleep.
Well, maybe you can try.

1424
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:29,241
I can't, I don't
want to sleep.

1425
01:22:29,257 --> 01:22:31,259
All I do is dream
about Livvie.

1426
01:22:32,380 --> 01:22:35,258
Now, Joan, you must forget
that. That wasn't your fault.

1427
01:22:35,387 --> 01:22:37,514
I know, it was nobody's fault.
But that's not it.

1428
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:40,546
Don't you understand? I've got
to do what she'd have done, too.

1429
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:42,052
But that's not the point.

1430
01:22:42,096 --> 01:22:43,765
I know what the point is.

1431
01:22:44,409 --> 01:22:46,411
When we joined the Army, I
don't know about the rest of you

1432
01:22:46,491 --> 01:22:48,368
but I had a feeling
that we might be in a war

1433
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:51,294
and I don't want to feel when this is
over that maybe I could've done more.

1434
01:22:51,349 --> 01:22:53,142
You're just trying
to do too much.

1435
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:56,286
What did we swear to when we joined
the Red Cross, do you remember?

1436
01:22:56,323 --> 01:22:58,116
"I solemnly pledge myself
before God

1437
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:01,761
"that I'll devote myself to the
welfare of those committed to my care."

1438
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:04,378
And it didn't say how many
or how much.

1439
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:06,881
Joan, that's the way
we all feel.

1440
01:23:06,964 --> 01:23:09,050
Maybe we do a lot
of grousing sometimes,

1441
01:23:09,162 --> 01:23:11,873
but that's one of the
privileges we're fighting for.

1442
01:23:11,938 --> 01:23:15,775
Now, all I ask you to do is
lie down for an hour, or so

1443
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,998
and then you can do
whatever you want.

1444
01:23:18,068 --> 01:23:20,445
Thanks. That's all I want
in my own way.

1445
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,916
Come on.

1446
01:23:24,546 --> 01:23:26,423
Come on, now, you lie
down for a little while.

1447
01:23:26,512 --> 01:23:28,514
Thanks, Davy.
I feel better.

1448
01:23:32,758 --> 01:23:35,928
You know, that's the first time
in my life I've ever fainted.

1449
01:23:36,112 --> 01:23:38,531
Before the war, many's the time
I could've used a good faint,

1450
01:23:38,542 --> 01:23:40,168
but the guys I know would've
thought it was phony.

1451
01:23:40,277 --> 01:23:42,029
I wasn't taking any chances.

1452
01:23:42,474 --> 01:23:45,227
There's my dream hero.
Davy, don't say anything.

1453
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,459
No, I won't.

1454
01:23:46,523 --> 01:23:49,609
Now what are you doing
down here again, you...

1455
01:23:49,761 --> 01:23:51,597
Kansas, what's wrong?

1456
01:23:53,925 --> 01:23:56,511
We're getting
the pants beat off us.

1457
01:23:56,586 --> 01:23:58,170
You're not quitting,
Kansas?

1458
01:23:58,205 --> 01:24:01,833
No, we're just making what's
known as a "strategic withdrawal."

1459
01:24:01,906 --> 01:24:04,117
Well, Kansas,
how bad is it?

1460
01:24:05,955 --> 01:24:08,333
The whole front line's
collapsed.

1461
01:24:12,548 --> 01:24:16,760
That bandage is filthy. Come on
in, Kansas. I'll change it for you.

1462
01:24:17,406 --> 01:24:20,117
Look, I know how short
you must be,

1463
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:22,184
but have you got
anything to eat?

1464
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:26,462
Yes, I've got some nice
southern fried monkey for you.

1465
01:24:27,006 --> 01:24:29,717
With ketchup?
No, with chili sauce.

1466
01:24:35,681 --> 01:24:38,351
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Colonel. What is it, Janet?

1467
01:24:38,457 --> 01:24:40,542
I just heard that
the front line's collapsed.

1468
01:24:40,539 --> 01:24:43,333
Well, you know there are lots of
rumors, thousands of them going around.

1469
01:24:43,431 --> 01:24:45,725
I don't think
this is a rumor.

1470
01:24:48,289 --> 01:24:49,874
Well, what do you want?

1471
01:24:49,908 --> 01:24:51,702
You've got to get
those girls out.

1472
01:24:51,759 --> 01:24:54,178
There's to be
no evacuation in Bataan.

1473
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:56,765
But you've got to, they're
sick, every one of them.

1474
01:24:56,848 --> 01:24:58,934
They're only going
through the motions.

1475
01:24:59,856 --> 01:25:01,608
Give them a rest
so they can work.

1476
01:25:01,706 --> 01:25:04,125
You're doing more for morale
than anything else in this sector.

1477
01:25:04,135 --> 01:25:06,179
Just seeing you girls around
is almost enough.

1478
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:09,294
If I were to evacuate you now, can't
you understand the panic would develop.

1479
01:25:09,340 --> 01:25:11,759
I know, Colonel... It's the
very thing the Japs would want.

1480
01:25:11,769 --> 01:25:13,313
If you leave,
the civilians would leave,

1481
01:25:13,389 --> 01:25:14,932
women and children
would clog the roads,

1482
01:25:15,124 --> 01:25:17,876
and there's a desperate
battle going on.

1483
01:25:18,362 --> 01:25:20,323
I'm sorry.
Of course you're right.

1484
01:25:20,444 --> 01:25:24,156
Don't worry, Janet. When the
time comes, I'll get you out.

1485
01:25:24,261 --> 01:25:26,137
Otherwise I'd never be
able to look my wife

1486
01:25:26,112 --> 01:25:29,115
or any other woman
in the face again.

1487
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:32,245
I don't envy you, Colonel.

1488
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,393
Oh, God. No!

1489
01:26:04,745 --> 01:26:07,414
Cut them down!
Get them under the bed!

1490
01:26:15,965 --> 01:26:18,676
Never mind those apes. Help me
with the children, Kansas.

1491
01:26:19,666 --> 01:26:20,917
Sponge.

1492
01:26:24,755 --> 01:26:27,716
Rosemary, take cover.
I can do this all right.

1493
01:26:27,763 --> 01:26:30,349
I'm not frightened
any longer, Jose.

1494
01:27:09,287 --> 01:27:11,289
Come on.
Come over here!

1495
01:27:35,659 --> 01:27:37,703
Litters! Litter bearers!

1496
01:27:41,327 --> 01:27:43,329
Get him into this ward.

1497
01:27:51,737 --> 01:27:53,196
Careful now.

1498
01:27:57,405 --> 01:28:00,867
What is it? It's a leg
wound. Lieutenant Summers.

1499
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,279
I'll tell Davy.

1500
01:28:07,699 --> 01:28:09,034
Lieutenant Summers
has been wounded.

1501
01:28:09,203 --> 01:28:10,330
What is it?

1502
01:28:10,359 --> 01:28:12,903
A leg wound.
Thank you, Chaplain.

1503
01:28:19,613 --> 01:28:21,448
They're machine gunning.
They're strafing.

1504
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:23,330
Beasts, the slimy beasts!

1505
01:28:34,534 --> 01:28:35,869
Chaplain.

1506
01:28:41,243 --> 01:28:43,829
They finished
the operation for me.

1507
01:28:47,951 --> 01:28:49,285
Rosemary!

1508
01:28:49,686 --> 01:28:51,104
Rosemary!

1509
01:28:59,749 --> 01:29:01,459
It's the surgery!

1510
01:29:01,831 --> 01:29:03,958
Rosemary!
Here, take this.

1511
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:06,877
Davy, come back!

1512
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:09,106
Rosemary!

1513
01:29:25,427 --> 01:29:27,930
Rosemary!
Don't go in there.

1514
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:30,862
Let it burn.

1515
01:29:35,606 --> 01:29:38,484
Your hand, Davy.
Your hand!

1516
01:29:47,288 --> 01:29:48,372
How is he, Chee?

1517
01:29:48,445 --> 01:29:50,489
His temperature is rising,
and the wound looks bad.

1518
01:29:50,527 --> 01:29:53,446
The fragment should be
removed immediately.

1519
01:29:53,766 --> 01:29:55,518
There isn't time.
We've been ordered off.

1520
01:29:55,617 --> 01:29:57,828
Ordered off?
To Corregidor.

1521
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,728
Chee, get him into a truck.

1522
01:29:59,781 --> 01:30:01,741
I have to report to the
Colonel, but I'll be right back.

1523
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:04,283
Yes, Davy. Litter.

1524
01:30:13,661 --> 01:30:16,831
I got everyone, sir.
We're ready to leave. Good.

1525
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:18,747
Goodbye, Janet.

1526
01:30:18,750 --> 01:30:20,835
Aren't you coming?
No, I'm not.

1527
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:24,368
But your orders. New orders
have just come through.

1528
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:25,795
Have we surrendered?

1529
01:30:26,153 --> 01:30:27,779
We'll surrender
at 9:00 in the morning.

1530
01:30:27,772 --> 01:30:30,942
Oh, no. They haven't cut us off yet?

1531
01:30:31,011 --> 01:30:33,514
No, I think it's the demolition
squads blowing up our dumps.

1532
01:30:33,671 --> 01:30:35,632
Come on. You better go!

1533
01:30:39,223 --> 01:30:40,516
Joan, have you seen Chee?

1534
01:30:40,611 --> 01:30:42,696
No, I haven't.
I don't think he's left yet.

1535
01:30:42,693 --> 01:30:44,236
You haven't time, Janet.

1536
01:30:44,312 --> 01:30:47,524
Janet, do one thing for me, see that
those girls get through to the rock.

1537
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:50,295
Yes, sir. We'll get through. So long.

1538
01:30:50,327 --> 01:30:51,745
Good luck.

1539
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:01,623
But before we reached the main
road, everybody heard the news.

1540
01:31:01,662 --> 01:31:04,165
Panic developed,
and the roads were jammed.

1541
01:31:04,207 --> 01:31:08,587
Normally, it took two hours to get
to Mariveles, that day it took eight

1542
01:31:08,718 --> 01:31:11,346
and the Jap reconnaissance
saw what was happening,

1543
01:31:11,379 --> 01:31:12,714
so by the time we got there,

1544
01:31:12,767 --> 01:31:15,812
it was being bombed
and shelled without mercy.

1545
01:31:29,076 --> 01:31:31,745
- Hurry up! Get into the tunnel.
- Davy!

1546
01:31:31,967 --> 01:31:34,678
Thank God, you got through!
Did you pass Chee on the road?

1547
01:31:34,859 --> 01:31:36,403
No.
Where are the children?

1548
01:31:36,478 --> 01:31:40,274
Kansas found a shelter for
them. Get down, everybody!

1549
01:31:46,426 --> 01:31:48,886
Hurry up! Get in!
Come on!

1550
01:31:59,959 --> 01:32:03,212
Listen, we still have a few
minutes. Keep under cover.

1551
01:32:03,313 --> 01:32:07,984
If I'm not back, get down to the wharf
as soon as you hear the boat whistle.

1552
01:32:11,641 --> 01:32:14,728
Ling Chee! Ling Chee!

1553
01:32:15,689 --> 01:32:17,274
Ling Chee!

1554
01:32:19,391 --> 01:32:20,892
Ling Chee!

1555
01:32:27,256 --> 01:32:31,552
I've got to get some sleep. I'm so
bomb-happy, nothing else matters.

1556
01:32:33,155 --> 01:32:34,156
Stay here!

1557
01:32:34,312 --> 01:32:35,938
But I thought you said
I could have one shot.

1558
01:32:36,047 --> 01:32:40,009
Later on. You've been detailed
to watch over your little sister.

1559
01:32:45,185 --> 01:32:47,313
Hello.
Hi, Kansas.

1560
01:32:47,382 --> 01:32:50,844
I can't believe it. I just
can't believe it! What?

1561
01:32:50,968 --> 01:32:54,639
The Marines, they have
landed and been ordered off.

1562
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:57,088
But it's not permanent.
It's not the end of the fight.

1563
01:32:57,214 --> 01:32:59,634
Yeah, but imagine it
happening to us, Americans!

1564
01:32:59,643 --> 01:33:01,019
All right, all out,
everybody!

1565
01:33:01,147 --> 01:33:03,232
We've been out
on our feet before.

1566
01:33:03,229 --> 01:33:05,898
Remember Valley Forge? That
was no strawberry festival.

1567
01:33:06,005 --> 01:33:08,173
Come on, kids, let's go.

1568
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:15,141
So long. What do you mean, "So long"?

1569
01:33:15,258 --> 01:33:18,845
I gotta get the other kids.
Well, I'll help, too, then.

1570
01:33:29,138 --> 01:33:30,973
How soon are you pulling out? Now.

1571
01:33:31,104 --> 01:33:33,439
Well, I'll get the next boat. There
isn't going to be any next boat.

1572
01:33:33,418 --> 01:33:35,128
Well, go ahead, then.
Shove off!

1573
01:33:35,268 --> 01:33:37,938
Davy, no!
Davy! Davy!

1574
01:33:53,891 --> 01:33:57,019
Do you have John? Yes, in
the tunnel. I have a doctor.

1575
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:01,305
John.

1576
01:34:03,838 --> 01:34:05,673
Where are the others?
You better go.

1577
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:07,315
There's plenty of time.

1578
01:34:07,540 --> 01:34:09,500
All right, I'm ready.

1579
01:34:24,427 --> 01:34:27,513
We'll have to go in for that bomb
fragment. It may become infected.

1580
01:34:27,550 --> 01:34:31,595
That's not likely. It's probably
a piece of good American steel.

1581
01:34:32,408 --> 01:34:34,118
All right, nurse.

1582
01:34:35,415 --> 01:34:37,542
Will you help?
If I can.

1583
01:34:39,001 --> 01:34:41,170
Sorry, we have
no anesthetic here. I...

1584
01:34:41,314 --> 01:34:43,858
Is it out of order
if we hold hands?

1585
01:34:44,090 --> 01:34:45,634
No, go ahead.

1586
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:58,378
It's all right, darling.
It's all right.

1587
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:03,493
I think I've located it. I'll have
another try. Now, this may hurt.

1588
01:35:03,523 --> 01:35:05,692
Sounds just like a dentist.

1589
01:35:06,299 --> 01:35:08,676
Darling, no matter what happens,
promise me you won't let...

1590
01:35:08,728 --> 01:35:10,730
No, no, I won't, dear.

1591
01:35:12,429 --> 01:35:15,223
Just hold on, Lieutenant. Try
to think of something else.

1592
01:35:15,321 --> 01:35:19,241
I am. Ham and eggs,

1593
01:35:19,369 --> 01:35:21,371
hot cakes,

1594
01:35:21,451 --> 01:35:24,162
white bread, coffee...

1595
01:35:24,458 --> 01:35:26,668
Here it comes now.
Hold on.

1596
01:35:32,786 --> 01:35:36,206
It's all right, Doctor. Go
right ahead. He's fainted.

1597
01:35:41,808 --> 01:35:45,186
Get in there. Go ahead, kids,
up front, go ahead. Hurry up!

1598
01:35:45,278 --> 01:35:47,280
They can't understand a word
you're saying, you know.

1599
01:35:47,245 --> 01:35:49,956
I know, but they know
what I'm feeling.

1600
01:35:50,021 --> 01:35:52,732
Well, so long. What do you mean,
"So long"? Aren't you coming?

1601
01:35:52,797 --> 01:35:54,674
No!
You're gonna be a hero.

1602
01:35:54,763 --> 01:35:58,225
Yeah. Okay, you win. Shut your eyes.

1603
01:35:58,233 --> 01:36:01,403
What for? Because I'm
gonna kiss you goodbye.

1604
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:34,964
I have a boat hidden
right here.

1605
01:36:54,332 --> 01:36:56,793
Take us.
Yes, hurry up. Get in.

1606
01:36:59,074 --> 01:37:00,575
Hey, any room?

1607
01:37:00,693 --> 01:37:02,486
Sorry, soldier,
but one more would swamp us.

1608
01:37:02,544 --> 01:37:04,087
- Can you swim?
- A bit.

1609
01:37:04,163 --> 01:37:06,833
Well, hang on and kick.
Thanks, lady.

1610
01:37:20,820 --> 01:37:22,948
Are you holding on, soldier?

1611
01:37:23,017 --> 01:37:24,977
Still with you, ma'am.

1612
01:37:35,972 --> 01:37:38,892
There's old Corregidor
answering them back!

1613
01:37:40,252 --> 01:37:42,087
You still with us...

1614
01:37:51,703 --> 01:37:54,748
Mind if we take one
minute's rest? My hands...

1615
01:37:54,826 --> 01:37:56,745
No, I can use it, too.

1616
01:38:03,848 --> 01:38:07,810
Look at those lights! It's so
regular. It seems like a message.

1617
01:38:10,903 --> 01:38:12,238
It is a message.

1618
01:38:12,870 --> 01:38:15,706
Three dots, three dashes,
three dots.

1619
01:38:16,802 --> 01:38:18,012
SOS.

1620
01:38:18,653 --> 01:38:20,030
SOS.

1621
01:38:32,302 --> 01:38:34,221
And then Corregidor.

1622
01:38:34,384 --> 01:38:35,802
It spelled safety for us,

1623
01:38:35,772 --> 01:38:38,525
because everyone called it
the Gibraltar of the Pacific.

1624
01:38:38,548 --> 01:38:41,718
Especially so, since the Army
engineers had dug a series of tunnels

1625
01:38:41,902 --> 01:38:44,322
down under 400 feet
of solid rock.

1626
01:38:44,910 --> 01:38:47,120
The main tunnel
was called Malinta.

1627
01:38:47,223 --> 01:38:49,517
This was about
1, 000 feet long,

1628
01:38:49,652 --> 01:38:52,280
and in peacetime,
trolleys ran through it.

1629
01:38:52,312 --> 01:38:55,566
There were about 40 laterals
off the main tunnel.

1630
01:38:55,782 --> 01:38:57,034
The one in which
we were to spend

1631
01:38:57,055 --> 01:38:59,724
most of our time was called
the "hospital lateral".

1632
01:38:59,831 --> 01:39:01,416
Here, the wounded
were piled up

1633
01:39:01,450 --> 01:39:03,911
in double
and triple-decker beds.

1634
01:39:04,457 --> 01:39:06,375
Another was our quarters.

1635
01:39:06,424 --> 01:39:09,135
There were about 25 nurses
there when we arrived.

1636
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:13,580
With us, the total came to 88 American
plus many more Filipino nurses.

1637
01:39:13,942 --> 01:39:15,569
Here, for the first time
in months,

1638
01:39:15,677 --> 01:39:18,889
we had a chance to wash
the Japs out of our hair.

1639
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:21,919
For a few days we were even able
to get outside the hospital tunnel

1640
01:39:22,039 --> 01:39:23,999
for a little fresh air.

1641
01:39:26,781 --> 01:39:27,991
Air raid!

1642
01:39:28,053 --> 01:39:29,597
And then they started.

1643
01:39:29,788 --> 01:39:32,875
They plastered us
but good, constantly.

1644
01:39:34,762 --> 01:39:36,096
As they stepped up
their tempo,

1645
01:39:36,150 --> 01:39:38,110
things got tougher
and tougher.

1646
01:39:38,116 --> 01:39:40,910
The thunder of the dive
bombers was incessant.

1647
01:39:41,008 --> 01:39:43,636
The noise almost
split our eardrums.

1648
01:39:44,247 --> 01:39:48,001
The old story. Too little
food, dwindling ammunition,

1649
01:39:48,179 --> 01:39:50,848
too many people
and too many wounded.

1650
01:39:50,956 --> 01:39:54,334
Gradually, Corregidor felt
like and became a prison.

1651
01:39:55,698 --> 01:39:57,325
And though everything
else was giving out,

1652
01:39:57,317 --> 01:39:59,235
we thanked God
for the blood plasma

1653
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:01,651
the Red Cross
had supplied us with.

1654
01:40:03,216 --> 01:40:05,801
Occasionally between bombings,
we went outside

1655
01:40:05,877 --> 01:40:09,464
and took our chances on a
shell rather than suffocation.

1656
01:40:09,578 --> 01:40:11,705
We listened hopefully
for news of home,

1657
01:40:11,776 --> 01:40:15,154
but the Japs jammed everything except
the commercials advertising food.

1658
01:40:15,246 --> 01:40:17,873
It makes a delicious salad
with whatever you have at hand,

1659
01:40:17,906 --> 01:40:19,324
pineapple,
strawberries,

1660
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:21,495
or any of the plentiful fruits about us.

1661
01:40:21,954 --> 01:40:24,123
Cooled deliciously
in your icebox,

1662
01:40:24,152 --> 01:40:26,154
it will bring sunny
California to your home.

1663
01:40:26,234 --> 01:40:28,111
Shut that thing off!

1664
01:40:30,976 --> 01:40:32,311
What? No dive bombers?

1665
01:40:32,364 --> 01:40:35,158
It's not time.
They're still out to lunch.

1666
01:40:36,875 --> 01:40:39,294
There's no quinine left.

1667
01:40:39,998 --> 01:40:41,458
Well, what are we gonna do?

1668
01:40:41,502 --> 01:40:43,295
Nurse, what do you think
we're going to do?

1669
01:40:43,353 --> 01:40:46,397
They can take us off.
Why are we here anyway?

1670
01:40:46,823 --> 01:40:49,200
Why? Why isn't there any quinine?

1671
01:40:49,252 --> 01:40:52,505
Why isn't there any food?
Why aren't there any supplies?

1672
01:40:52,606 --> 01:40:54,816
Why are we waiting here
like rats in a cage

1673
01:40:54,804 --> 01:40:58,557
waiting for the man to come
and pour scalding water over us?

1674
01:40:58,968 --> 01:41:00,511
Why was nothing done? Why?

1675
01:41:00,587 --> 01:41:02,130
Take it easy, Davy.

1676
01:41:02,206 --> 01:41:04,125
I'll tell you why.
It's our own fault.

1677
01:41:04,173 --> 01:41:05,883
Our fault?
What did we do?

1678
01:41:06,024 --> 01:41:08,234
Because we believed
we were the world.

1679
01:41:08,221 --> 01:41:11,683
That the United States of
America was the whole world.

1680
01:41:11,807 --> 01:41:15,895
Those outlandish places:
Bataan, Corregidor, and Mindanao.

1681
01:41:15,971 --> 01:41:18,682
Those aren't
American names.

1682
01:41:18,747 --> 01:41:21,625
No, they're
just American graveyards.

1683
01:41:22,101 --> 01:41:23,728
Well, why don't
they get us off?

1684
01:41:23,836 --> 01:41:25,713
They can't get us off.

1685
01:41:25,803 --> 01:41:28,472
We've become what they call
"a delaying action."

1686
01:41:28,579 --> 01:41:30,706
That's what those 50,000 men
over there were.

1687
01:41:30,776 --> 01:41:33,070
They were merely
saving time.

1688
01:41:33,784 --> 01:41:37,413
I hope to God the people back
home aren't losing it for us.

1689
01:41:37,485 --> 01:41:39,738
Do you remember what the
Chaplain once told us?

1690
01:41:39,798 --> 01:41:42,676
It's our present.
We're giving them time.

1691
01:41:44,656 --> 01:41:47,284
Well, they're always
on time anyway.

1692
01:41:48,820 --> 01:41:51,323
Air raid!
Everybody in the tunnel.

1693
01:42:03,626 --> 01:42:06,086
I can't stand it any longer!
I've got to get out of here!

1694
01:42:06,170 --> 01:42:08,005
Tony!
Tony!

1695
01:42:19,819 --> 01:42:21,988
Feeling better, Tony?
Much, thanks.

1696
01:42:22,017 --> 01:42:25,020
I'm sorry I blew up yesterday. Guess
I had a case of the heebie-jeebies.

1697
01:42:25,140 --> 01:42:26,350
Don't worry about it.

1698
01:42:26,412 --> 01:42:28,122
Those little outbursts are
about the only cold showers

1699
01:42:28,147 --> 01:42:29,565
we get around here.

1700
01:42:29,651 --> 01:42:31,736
Maybe you could use one?

1701
01:42:31,849 --> 01:42:34,435
What did you think I was doing
yesterday when I shot my mouth off?

1702
01:42:34,509 --> 01:42:36,219
I feel better, too.

1703
01:42:38,210 --> 01:42:41,129
Hello, Ma.
What you got there?

1704
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:42,764
My grandson.

1705
01:42:42,837 --> 01:42:44,630
Oh, he's cute.

1706
01:42:45,497 --> 01:42:46,915
He looks just like...

1707
01:42:47,232 --> 01:42:49,776
Yes, he does.
Particularly at that age.

1708
01:42:52,553 --> 01:42:54,931
That's what I have
to live for.

1709
01:42:55,792 --> 01:42:57,669
Janet, can I speak
to you a minute?

1710
01:42:57,758 --> 01:43:00,928
What are you doing down here?
We discharged you a week ago.

1711
01:43:00,997 --> 01:43:03,041
I thought you knew
I was your permanent patient.

1712
01:43:03,194 --> 01:43:04,696
What is it, darling?

1713
01:43:04,698 --> 01:43:07,535
I just wanted to say
goodbye for a few days.

1714
01:43:07,705 --> 01:43:09,373
What are you talking about?

1715
01:43:09,325 --> 01:43:10,743
We sort of made up
a little party,

1716
01:43:10,828 --> 01:43:11,995
and we're going down
around Mindanao

1717
01:43:12,101 --> 01:43:14,311
to see if we can find
some quinine.

1718
01:43:14,414 --> 01:43:15,749
You can't go.

1719
01:43:15,802 --> 01:43:16,803
Why not?

1720
01:43:17,421 --> 01:43:19,257
Your leg.
You're still too weak.

1721
01:43:19,388 --> 01:43:20,764
I'm no weaker
than the rest.

1722
01:43:20,891 --> 01:43:22,392
John, you're not well yet.

1723
01:43:22,395 --> 01:43:25,940
We'll all be a lot worse
if we don't get some supplies.

1724
01:43:28,525 --> 01:43:29,693
When do you have to go?

1725
01:43:29,798 --> 01:43:31,341
We leave at 5:00 in the morning.

1726
01:43:32,111 --> 01:43:34,488
That's nine long hours
from now.

1727
01:43:40,555 --> 01:43:44,559
Ma, I want you to know I'm
going to break a regulation.

1728
01:43:44,950 --> 01:43:47,369
Is that something
new with you?

1729
01:43:49,114 --> 01:43:51,366
But I'm really going
to smash one this time.

1730
01:43:52,237 --> 01:43:53,572
I'm going to get married.

1731
01:43:56,748 --> 01:43:57,999
To him?

1732
01:44:02,300 --> 01:44:04,344
I'll get Chaplain Frank.
Can we get married here, Ma?

1733
01:44:04,382 --> 01:44:06,885
No. I don't know
about this, officially.

1734
01:44:06,927 --> 01:44:08,678
Better not in the tunnels.

1735
01:44:08,778 --> 01:44:12,199
I know, the bakery. It's still
standing, and they've a light there.

1736
01:44:12,248 --> 01:44:13,666
In the meantime,
I'll get dressed.

1737
01:44:13,751 --> 01:44:15,336
Dressed into what?

1738
01:44:16,296 --> 01:44:18,340
Maybe we could fix up
one of your skirts.

1739
01:44:18,378 --> 01:44:21,507
Just so the whole thing
isn't too confusing.

1740
01:44:26,243 --> 01:44:29,371
Dear God, we have
none of the things

1741
01:44:29,482 --> 01:44:33,444
which are usually used to
solemnize marriage in this one,

1742
01:44:33,415 --> 01:44:37,753
except the thing that you
prize most, sincerity of heart.

1743
01:44:38,967 --> 01:44:44,597
Amid all the boiling hatred,
both righteous and unrighteous,

1744
01:44:46,254 --> 01:44:49,549
two of your servants, Lord,
have found love

1745
01:44:49,608 --> 01:44:51,860
and desire to be wed
in Thine eyes.

1746
01:44:53,425 --> 01:44:57,804
Help me, Oh, Lord,
to consecrate this marriage.

1747
01:45:02,216 --> 01:45:05,720
And now, John,

1748
01:45:06,843 --> 01:45:11,722
wilt thou have this woman to thy
wedded wife, to have and to hold?

1749
01:45:11,816 --> 01:45:17,363
Wilt thou love her, honor her,
comfort her in sickness and in health?

1750
01:45:17,484 --> 01:45:23,949
And forsaking all others, keep
her till death do you part?

1751
01:45:24,540 --> 01:45:25,791
I will.

1752
01:45:27,778 --> 01:45:33,534
Janet, wilt thou have this man
to thy wedded husband?

1753
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:38,081
To have and to hold?

1754
01:45:42,931 --> 01:45:44,558
I will.

1755
01:45:46,863 --> 01:45:49,324
I then pronounce you
man and wife.

1756
01:45:50,333 --> 01:45:52,126
God bless you both.

1757
01:45:54,729 --> 01:45:57,440
That's where you kiss, kids.

1758
01:46:00,512 --> 01:46:02,306
Okay, break it up.

1759
01:46:04,792 --> 01:46:07,586
Here's your wedding present.
It's the best I could do,

1760
01:46:08,262 --> 01:46:09,596
a bottle of wine.

1761
01:46:09,650 --> 01:46:10,859
Where did you get that?

1762
01:46:10,922 --> 01:46:12,757
The General. I told him
I needed to get drunk,

1763
01:46:12,889 --> 01:46:15,725
and he was so surprised
he gave it to me.

1764
01:46:15,780 --> 01:46:17,490
Some peanut butter
and bread.

1765
01:46:17,515 --> 01:46:19,601
It's a wonderful present, Ma.

1766
01:46:20,870 --> 01:46:22,872
This bit of jade.

1767
01:46:22,952 --> 01:46:26,038
It's some 2,000 years old.
Keep it.

1768
01:46:27,116 --> 01:46:29,952
For there are three wishes
that go with it,

1769
01:46:30,007 --> 01:46:34,303
good luck, long life
and an abundance of children.

1770
01:46:36,022 --> 01:46:38,024
Thank you, Chee.
Thanks for everything.

1771
01:46:38,104 --> 01:46:40,857
I have nothing to offer
except a bit of gum.

1772
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:42,798
We'll take it.

1773
01:46:42,962 --> 01:46:45,631
Now, go ahead
and have your honeymoon.

1774
01:46:46,201 --> 01:46:48,244
Thank you.
Thank you, Chaplain.

1775
01:46:48,398 --> 01:46:50,775
God bless you both.
Good night.

1776
01:46:51,637 --> 01:46:54,139
Peanut butter.
I wonder if...

1777
01:46:54,182 --> 01:46:55,558
No, leave them alone.

1778
01:46:55,685 --> 01:46:58,021
Come with me, and I'll see
if I can dig some up for you.

1779
01:46:57,999 --> 01:46:59,167
Good.

1780
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:07,464
I'm not going to eat anymore.
I'm going to save some.

1781
01:47:07,599 --> 01:47:09,475
Not me. This isn't
the kind of wedding cake

1782
01:47:09,565 --> 01:47:12,610
you put under your pillow
and sleep on.

1783
01:47:14,076 --> 01:47:16,036
The stars look
like street lights.

1784
01:47:16,158 --> 01:47:17,200
They are.

1785
01:47:17,662 --> 01:47:19,623
Haven't you ever been
to the Rainbow Room before?

1786
01:47:19,629 --> 01:47:21,798
That's the street below us.

1787
01:47:24,834 --> 01:47:28,170
I guess marrying you has changed
my perspective completely.

1788
01:47:28,304 --> 01:47:30,264
It's probably the wine.

1789
01:47:31,080 --> 01:47:34,041
I thought you were going to take me
to a dingy little French restaurant.

1790
01:47:34,087 --> 01:47:36,089
This is pretty classy.

1791
01:47:36,169 --> 01:47:39,089
Holy cats! You remember
everything I say.

1792
01:47:40,564 --> 01:47:42,774
I take you very seriously.

1793
01:47:46,810 --> 01:47:48,687
What is it, darling?

1794
01:47:50,512 --> 01:47:53,098
Did I ever tell you
about my place in the country?

1795
01:47:53,172 --> 01:47:54,298
No.

1796
01:47:55,832 --> 01:47:59,043
You know, I don't know
anything about you really.

1797
01:47:59,534 --> 01:48:02,454
I don't even know
if you have a middle name.

1798
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:05,044
I have. It's Matathias.

1799
01:48:06,358 --> 01:48:07,359
Why?

1800
01:48:07,399 --> 01:48:09,651
An uncle. He left me this little
farm I was telling you about.

1801
01:48:09,712 --> 01:48:11,130
It's quite worth it.

1802
01:48:11,216 --> 01:48:12,300
Is it?

1803
01:48:12,373 --> 01:48:13,749
Yes, and you'd love it.

1804
01:48:16,305 --> 01:48:19,224
The time will come when you and
I will go out on a summer evening

1805
01:48:19,313 --> 01:48:20,898
when the grass is fresh

1806
01:48:21,048 --> 01:48:24,385
and the clouds white,
as if they'd just been washed.

1807
01:48:24,402 --> 01:48:29,866
The earth's warm and still,
and time passes quietly.

1808
01:48:30,648 --> 01:48:33,943
Everything's simple.
Just you and me and the kids.

1809
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:37,534
Sons?

1810
01:48:37,588 --> 01:48:39,089
Daughters.
They're more decorative.

1811
01:48:40,480 --> 01:48:42,941
Let's get out of here
and go home.

1812
01:48:43,719 --> 01:48:44,887
Home!

1813
01:48:49,733 --> 01:48:52,403
I remember
a poet somewhere.

1814
01:48:52,394 --> 01:48:55,314
He said, "Home
is the place where

1815
01:48:55,401 --> 01:48:58,905
"when you have to go there,
they have to take you in."

1816
01:49:00,259 --> 01:49:02,762
You want to know something?
What?

1817
01:49:02,919 --> 01:49:05,004
I'm not afraid any longer.

1818
01:49:20,848 --> 01:49:22,141
Darling.

1819
01:49:23,161 --> 01:49:25,788
Darling, it's time to get up.

1820
01:49:26,747 --> 01:49:29,333
It's time to get up
and go to work.

1821
01:49:30,795 --> 01:49:33,131
You've only got
five minutes.

1822
01:49:38,082 --> 01:49:40,876
Fine time to go to sleep,
on our honeymoon.

1823
01:49:40,974 --> 01:49:43,268
It was a wonderful
honeymoon.

1824
01:49:44,791 --> 01:49:47,127
Here. Finish that up.
No, you.

1825
01:49:47,220 --> 01:49:48,347
Go ahead.

1826
01:49:48,376 --> 01:49:50,962
As my grandmother used to say,
"It'll warm your stomach up."

1827
01:49:51,037 --> 01:49:52,581
To you, honey.

1828
01:50:01,447 --> 01:50:02,656
To us?

1829
01:50:14,286 --> 01:50:15,662
Here's your breakfast.

1830
01:50:15,790 --> 01:50:16,874
Thank you.

1831
01:50:24,002 --> 01:50:26,296
Lieutenant Summers.
Yes, sir?

1832
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:27,788
Just want to wish you
good luck.

1833
01:50:27,819 --> 01:50:29,863
Thank you, sir.

1834
01:50:34,065 --> 01:50:35,441
So long, Lieutenant.

1835
01:50:35,684 --> 01:50:37,394
So long, Lieutenant.

1836
01:50:38,692 --> 01:50:40,235
So long, Davy.

1837
01:50:40,542 --> 01:50:43,711
Good luck, Chee.
Take care of him.

1838
01:50:43,781 --> 01:50:45,617
Don't worry, I will.

1839
01:50:47,598 --> 01:50:50,017
Wait for me here.
I'll be back.

1840
01:50:51,068 --> 01:50:52,862
I'll be right here.

1841
01:51:40,111 --> 01:51:41,404
What you doing?

1842
01:51:41,499 --> 01:51:43,459
This radio's
on the blink again.

1843
01:51:45,547 --> 01:51:48,466
What would you like better
than anything else in the world?

1844
01:51:48,555 --> 01:51:51,683
A tomato. I'd give
my left knee for a tomato.

1845
01:51:52,487 --> 01:51:56,283
Tomato and some Flying Fortresses,
wouldn't that make a lovely salad?

1846
01:51:56,420 --> 01:51:58,797
Yeah.
Why'd you ask me, Kansas?

1847
01:51:59,312 --> 01:52:01,565
Well, I got something for you.

1848
01:52:01,856 --> 01:52:05,943
Chocolate. Oh, gee,
Kansas, that's swell of you.

1849
01:52:07,871 --> 01:52:09,080
Where'd you get it?

1850
01:52:09,143 --> 01:52:11,687
Well, a raiding pile of Japs
tried to land last night,

1851
01:52:11,688 --> 01:52:15,024
and I got me a couple of them
and on one of them...

1852
01:52:15,968 --> 01:52:19,221
Kansas, how could you do
a thing like that to me?

1853
01:52:20,363 --> 01:52:24,033
I can't figure you dames out.
Chocolate is chocolate.

1854
01:52:24,527 --> 01:52:26,780
You're positively
disgusting!

1855
01:52:27,303 --> 01:52:29,513
And don't fiddle with that,
you'll get a shock.

1856
01:52:29,617 --> 01:52:32,078
Who me?
I never get shocked.

1857
01:52:34,475 --> 01:52:37,769
Look, don't you ever say
"don't" to me again.

1858
01:52:40,027 --> 01:52:41,320
There, you see?

1859
01:52:41,415 --> 01:52:43,626
Attention,
you fools on Corregidor.

1860
01:52:43,728 --> 01:52:47,524
This is the son of heaven's
birthday, our emperor Hirohito.

1861
01:52:47,545 --> 01:52:49,630
We wish you
to help us celebrate.

1862
01:52:49,743 --> 01:52:51,369
You will not object,
I am sure,

1863
01:52:51,478 --> 01:52:53,897
for you are the objector.
Banzai!

1864
01:52:57,492 --> 01:52:59,952
Air raid! Air raid!

1865
01:53:01,078 --> 01:53:05,082
Never a dull moment. This is
like living on a bull's-eye.

1866
01:53:06,167 --> 01:53:08,378
That was the worst
pasting we ever got.

1867
01:53:08,365 --> 01:53:11,744
I think they must have hit every
inch of the island that day.

1868
01:53:11,835 --> 01:53:15,631
Then suddenly, like magic, late
in the afternoon, it stopped

1869
01:53:15,652 --> 01:53:20,616
when they all went off to get drunk
to celebrate their god, Hirohito.

1870
01:53:20,973 --> 01:53:22,308
This quiet,

1871
01:53:22,708 --> 01:53:25,419
it's like the tropics you read
about in romance magazines.

1872
01:53:25,484 --> 01:53:27,111
They'll celebrate
all night long.

1873
01:53:27,103 --> 01:53:30,065
I hope they have the biggest
hangover the world has ever known.

1874
01:53:30,110 --> 01:53:33,656
Four thousand 100's,
$400,000.

1875
01:53:34,390 --> 01:53:36,684
I guess this is what
they call hot money.

1876
01:53:36,819 --> 01:53:39,572
Four thousand 20's.
$80,000.

1877
01:53:40,868 --> 01:53:42,328
Say, what goes on here?

1878
01:53:42,487 --> 01:53:43,989
They're destroying money.

1879
01:53:43,991 --> 01:53:46,368
Destroying money? Why, that's
the silliest thing I ever heard.

1880
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,089
We ought to notify
the authorities or something.

1881
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:50,992
They are the authorities. They're
from the finance department.

1882
01:53:51,046 --> 01:53:53,841
First time I ever even
saw enough money to burn.

1883
01:53:54,169 --> 01:53:55,838
All the nurses are wanted
at the mess hall.

1884
01:53:55,904 --> 01:53:57,739
Not for food.
Don't tell me.

1885
01:53:57,871 --> 01:53:59,206
No, right away.

1886
01:53:59,490 --> 01:54:02,118
Four thousand 20's.
That's $80,000.

1887
01:54:13,486 --> 01:54:15,738
Attention, everybody, please.

1888
01:54:17,303 --> 01:54:19,055
Colonel Clark has
something to tell you.

1889
01:54:19,153 --> 01:54:21,738
Thank you, Captain.
At ease.

1890
01:54:24,821 --> 01:54:27,199
This is a very
serious occasion.

1891
01:54:28,175 --> 01:54:31,678
It's not known how much longer
Corregidor can hold out.

1892
01:54:34,537 --> 01:54:37,165
I have here orders
from headquarters.

1893
01:54:37,197 --> 01:54:40,575
You nurses are to be
evacuated tonight to Australia.

1894
01:54:41,246 --> 01:54:45,292
You'll meet in front of the main
hospital tunnel at 9:00 tonight.

1895
01:54:46,219 --> 01:54:48,221
These orders are secret.

1896
01:54:49,458 --> 01:54:50,834
I want you to know

1897
01:54:50,962 --> 01:54:53,715
that in the name of General
Wainwright and myself,

1898
01:54:53,854 --> 01:54:57,108
there are no words high enough
to praise you all.

1899
01:54:59,521 --> 01:55:00,939
Good luck.

1900
01:55:07,618 --> 01:55:08,869
Captain.

1901
01:55:11,319 --> 01:55:13,572
Well look, Ma, couldn't another
one of the girls go in my place?

1902
01:55:13,517 --> 01:55:14,894
I haven't any family and...

1903
01:55:15,021 --> 01:55:18,399
Ma, I'd just as soon...
These are official orders!

1904
01:55:19,879 --> 01:55:21,548
I know what
you're all thinking,

1905
01:55:21,614 --> 01:55:24,075
but the entire nurse corps
has been ordered off.

1906
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:26,494
You girls just happen
to be the first.

1907
01:55:26,587 --> 01:55:29,590
You can pack one handbag
or your musette, that's all.

1908
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:31,420
There's just
one other thing.

1909
01:55:31,445 --> 01:55:34,782
These orders must be kept
secret, you're to tell no one.

1910
01:55:35,378 --> 01:55:37,130
I'll see you later.

1911
01:55:44,516 --> 01:55:45,517
What are you doing?

1912
01:55:45,672 --> 01:55:48,133
Nothing.
Just cleaning house.

1913
01:56:01,750 --> 01:56:03,585
Irma.
Yeah?

1914
01:56:04,758 --> 01:56:08,137
Do you know anybody that could
take a letter out to the States?

1915
01:56:08,228 --> 01:56:09,729
It's to my mother.

1916
01:56:10,194 --> 01:56:13,823
Yes, I think I know someone.
I'll give it to him.

1917
01:56:15,399 --> 01:56:16,859
Thanks, pal.

1918
01:56:43,969 --> 01:56:47,598
I've got to get some fresh
air. I'll see you kids around.

1919
01:56:59,005 --> 01:57:02,509
Here, George. I found another
fountain pen, so you can have this one.

1920
01:57:02,591 --> 01:57:04,134
Thanks, Joanie.

1921
01:57:08,953 --> 01:57:12,832
Here, Joe. You've had your
eye on this for some time.

1922
01:57:12,885 --> 01:57:15,137
Okay, Joe.
Okay, Joe.

1923
01:57:18,091 --> 01:57:20,010
I know we're short of
things to read here,

1924
01:57:20,057 --> 01:57:22,727
and I found some old
love letters of mine.

1925
01:57:23,411 --> 01:57:27,707
I'll just put them here, so you
have a kind of circulating library.

1926
01:57:27,807 --> 01:57:31,477
They're pretty funny. Maybe
they'll give you some laughs.

1927
01:57:39,026 --> 01:57:41,487
Who's there?
It's me, Kansas.

1928
01:57:42,265 --> 01:57:43,558
Hi, kid.

1929
01:57:46,198 --> 01:57:47,491
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1930
01:57:47,586 --> 01:57:48,545
Sure.

1931
01:57:49,552 --> 01:57:52,347
Keep your mind on the gun, Chuck. Okay.

1932
01:58:02,391 --> 01:58:04,727
We've been
ordered off, Kansas.

1933
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:07,364
I know. It's all over
the rock already.

1934
01:58:08,868 --> 01:58:11,121
Well, I came
to say goodbye.

1935
01:58:12,685 --> 01:58:15,855
Well, I'm glad
you did. Bye.

1936
01:58:17,543 --> 01:58:19,628
If you don't wait for me,
I'll break your neck.

1937
01:58:19,741 --> 01:58:22,035
Be sure you don't
break yours.

1938
01:58:24,715 --> 01:58:27,426
Give me a loan of your
handkerchief, will you?

1939
01:58:27,491 --> 01:58:29,368
And stop your sniffling!

1940
01:58:29,457 --> 01:58:30,541
Why don't you?

1941
01:58:30,614 --> 01:58:32,240
You know I can't help it.
It's a habit with me.

1942
01:58:32,349 --> 01:58:34,309
Well, I can't, either.

1943
01:58:36,397 --> 01:58:39,150
When you get back,
you should get some real ones.

1944
01:58:39,289 --> 01:58:42,125
I used to get mine
at the five-and-dimes.

1945
01:58:42,181 --> 01:58:45,351
Big red ones.
Remember? Bandanas.

1946
01:58:45,419 --> 01:58:48,923
Jeepers, what a place those five-and-dimes
are, everything in them, huh?

1947
01:58:49,005 --> 01:58:50,173
Yeah.

1948
01:58:50,740 --> 01:58:53,993
You might send me a dozen
of them when you get back.

1949
01:58:54,094 --> 01:58:55,596
Where, Kansas?

1950
01:58:55,598 --> 01:58:59,977
Here, where do you think? I'll
be here till Tokyo freezes over.

1951
01:59:01,150 --> 01:59:02,652
I suppose
if we were to surrender,

1952
01:59:02,654 --> 01:59:05,115
that you'd be
dumb enough not to.

1953
01:59:05,892 --> 01:59:07,810
Yeah, I'd be dumb that way.

1954
01:59:08,437 --> 01:59:10,022
Oh, Kansas!

1955
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,885
We should have been doing
more of this in the campaign.

1956
01:59:18,963 --> 01:59:20,757
You and your wanting
to be pals.

1957
01:59:20,813 --> 01:59:23,441
I thought you were just
another guy on the make.

1958
01:59:23,474 --> 01:59:24,725
I was.

1959
01:59:29,488 --> 01:59:32,658
Gee, I'm glad I met up
with you, Kansas.

1960
01:59:32,727 --> 01:59:34,646
The pleasure's
been all mine.

1961
01:59:37,469 --> 01:59:39,054
You big blimp.

1962
01:59:42,559 --> 01:59:46,729
Well, so long, kid.
I'll be seeing you.

1963
01:59:47,301 --> 01:59:49,970
Goodbye and be careful,
don't get killed.

1964
01:59:50,077 --> 01:59:53,372
Who, me?
I never get killed.

1965
02:00:12,979 --> 02:00:14,898
There you are, O'Doul.

1966
02:00:17,143 --> 02:00:19,520
Well, I guess
that's everybody.

1967
02:00:19,688 --> 02:00:22,483
Good luck to you,
children, all of you.

1968
02:00:24,777 --> 02:00:27,280
Goodbye, Davy.
I'm not going.

1969
02:00:27,322 --> 02:00:30,200
You're not what? I'm not
going. I never intended to.

1970
02:00:30,329 --> 02:00:31,455
You heard the orders.

1971
02:00:31,602 --> 02:00:33,479
Now, I don't want any funny
business, get in that boat.

1972
02:00:33,452 --> 02:00:34,453
No.

1973
02:00:34,609 --> 02:00:36,235
Do you realize every
moment of stalling here

1974
02:00:36,344 --> 02:00:38,554
means that those planes
in the harbor are in danger?

1975
02:00:38,542 --> 02:00:39,668
That's not our artillery!

1976
02:00:39,814 --> 02:00:43,318
I can't go. I promised I'd be here
when he got back, he asked me to.

1977
02:00:43,400 --> 02:00:45,945
Now please, Ma.
I order you to go!

1978
02:00:46,176 --> 02:00:48,970
I won't take orders.
I'm not in the Army anymore.

1979
02:00:49,067 --> 02:00:51,820
When I married, I broke
regulations. It meant I was out.

1980
02:00:51,843 --> 02:00:53,136
You can't make me go.

1981
02:00:53,231 --> 02:00:55,734
Stop talking like
a hysterical schoolgirl.

1982
02:00:55,776 --> 02:00:58,738
I'm going to be right here
when he gets back.

1983
02:00:58,783 --> 02:01:00,494
He won't be back.

1984
02:01:00,865 --> 02:01:03,617
How do you know?
Tell me, how do you know?

1985
02:01:03,757 --> 02:01:05,091
There's been
no word at all.

1986
02:01:05,145 --> 02:01:07,230
They've considered them
officially lost for a week.

1987
02:01:07,343 --> 02:01:09,053
You're lying. You know
you're just saying...

1988
02:01:09,078 --> 02:01:12,248
Would I lie about that, Davy?
Would I?

1989
02:01:12,317 --> 02:01:15,361
No, you wouldn't.
But I know he's still alive.

1990
02:01:15,440 --> 02:01:17,817
He's out there somewhere.
I can't go, I can't!

1991
02:01:17,984 --> 02:01:19,443
Janet, if he's alive,
he'll find you!

1992
02:01:19,488 --> 02:01:21,114
Let me go,
I'm not going!

1993
02:01:21,223 --> 02:01:22,933
Down, everybody!

1994
02:01:30,245 --> 02:01:31,413
Davy!

1995
02:01:31,633 --> 02:01:32,676
Was she hit?

1996
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:35,626
No, she's just stunned.
Get her in the boat!

1997
02:01:46,323 --> 02:01:48,868
She wasn't like the rest
of us. She never gave way.

1998
02:01:48,867 --> 02:01:51,536
But now everything
snapped at once.

1999
02:01:51,990 --> 02:01:55,660
When we got her on board the
plane, she never spoke again.

2000
02:01:56,270 --> 02:01:59,231
Maybe we should have
left her on Corregidor.

2001
02:01:59,624 --> 02:02:02,335
What's happened would have
happened some way or another.

2002
02:02:02,516 --> 02:02:05,102
Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

2003
02:02:08,299 --> 02:02:12,386
Now I think maybe I can try to
make her speak, to hear, at least.

2004
02:02:19,982 --> 02:02:23,735
Miss Davidson, we're
almost home. Do you hear me?

2005
02:02:23,799 --> 02:02:25,134
We're almost home.

2006
02:02:29,698 --> 02:02:31,158
Chair, nurse.

2007
02:02:32,705 --> 02:02:34,707
I have a letter for you.

2008
02:02:45,891 --> 02:02:49,853
"My darling, I'm writing this
from Mindanao.

2009
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:53,235
"We leave in the morning
for an unknown destination.

2010
02:02:53,178 --> 02:02:55,639
"I write with no
so-called premonitions.

2011
02:02:55,723 --> 02:02:58,143
"As a matter of fact, I'm writing
this in a pleasant little bar

2012
02:02:58,268 --> 02:03:00,229
"on the outskirts.

2013
02:03:00,234 --> 02:03:02,820
"I've ordered two daiquiris,

2014
02:03:02,894 --> 02:03:06,064
"one for you
and one for me.

2015
02:03:07,984 --> 02:03:11,446
"I miss you.
I miss you all the time.

2016
02:03:12,263 --> 02:03:14,807
"It was such a short time,
wasn't it?

2017
02:03:14,924 --> 02:03:17,385
"And yet,
I remember every second of it.

2018
02:03:18,047 --> 02:03:19,715
"From the moment
you washed my back,

2019
02:03:19,666 --> 02:03:22,002
"and I could use
a good bath right now,

2020
02:03:22,095 --> 02:03:26,183
"till your face faded from view
in the darkness when I left.

2021
02:03:29,845 --> 02:03:31,889
"I think about you
all the time,

2022
02:03:31,927 --> 02:03:33,929
"and wish things
were different.

2023
02:03:34,356 --> 02:03:36,400
"Things will be different.

2024
02:03:36,554 --> 02:03:39,473
"I know that now because
there is good in this war,

2025
02:03:39,561 --> 02:03:41,020
"much as I hate it.

2026
02:03:41,643 --> 02:03:44,187
"This is not just
a war of soldiers.

2027
02:03:44,303 --> 02:03:46,556
"You weren't soldiers
in the strict sense.

2028
02:03:46,617 --> 02:03:51,580
"You were just kids from all
walks of life. All kinds of people.

2029
02:03:52,863 --> 02:03:56,616
"There's something new in
this war, something good.

2030
02:03:56,795 --> 02:03:58,922
"You could see it,
this new thing,

2031
02:03:58,877 --> 02:04:03,507
"even in their tired, hungry faces
as they took courage one from another.

2032
02:04:04,082 --> 02:04:08,086
"This is not a people's war,
because civilians also get killed."

2033
02:04:08,131 --> 02:04:10,801
"It's the people's war because
they have taken it over now

2034
02:04:10,907 --> 02:04:13,785
"and are going to win it
and end it with a purpose.

2035
02:04:13,798 --> 02:04:19,011
"To live like men with dignity in
freedom. This is the good I've found.

2036
02:04:19,929 --> 02:04:22,599
"There's a small voice
whispering around the earth.

2037
02:04:22,589 --> 02:04:25,926
"And the people are beginning
to talk across their boundaries.

2038
02:04:25,943 --> 02:04:30,072
"This voice will grow in volume,
until it thunders all over the world.

2039
02:04:30,223 --> 02:04:33,476
"It's what you said, and what
Jose said and what Rosemary felt,

2040
02:04:33,577 --> 02:04:34,953
"and Olivia.

2041
02:04:34,965 --> 02:04:36,800
"It's the rage
that made Kansas cry.

2042
02:04:36,816 --> 02:04:39,568
"It says,
'This is our war now,

2043
02:04:39,708 --> 02:04:42,252
"and this time
it will be our peace."

2044
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:48,420
"I'm proud,
proud to have known you,

2045
02:04:48,499 --> 02:04:50,626
"proud to have
received your love.

2046
02:04:51,506 --> 02:04:57,137
"Already I've had a complete,
rich life in three short months.

2047
02:04:57,521 --> 02:05:00,816
"I'm enclosing a deed to that
little farm I told you about.

2048
02:05:00,875 --> 02:05:04,545
"It's now in your name.
I'll wait for you there.

2049
02:05:05,270 --> 02:05:08,731
"Or if you're there first,
wait for me.

2050
02:05:09,550 --> 02:05:13,429
"Thank you. Thank you,
my darling, for my life.

2051
02:05:13,483 --> 02:05:15,610
"Thank you for everything.

2052
02:05:16,490 --> 02:05:21,495
"Your devoted, and this is the
first time I've ever written this,

2053
02:05:21,579 --> 02:05:23,747
"your devoted husband."

2054
02:05:24,124 --> 02:05:25,250
John.
