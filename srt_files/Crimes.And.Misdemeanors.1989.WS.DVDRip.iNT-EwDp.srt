1
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,318
We're all very proud of
Judah Rosenthal's philanthropic efforts.

2
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,474
His endless hours of fundraising
for the hospital, the new medical centre,

3
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,669
and now the ophthalmology wing which,
until this year, had just been a dream.

4
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,199
But it's Judah Rosenthal, our friend,
that we most appreciate.

5
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,034
The husband, the father,
the golf companion.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,590
- Naturally for a medical problem...
- You're blushing, darling.

7
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,671
..weekends or holidays.

8
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,436
But you can also call Judah to find out
which is the best restaurant in Paris.

9
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,238
Or Athens.

10
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,993
Or which hotel to stay at in Moscow.

11
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,959
Or the best recording
of a particular Mozart symphony.

12
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,271
My father is so nervous
about having to get up and speak.

13
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,558
I knew he was nervous when you didn't
eat any of those cocktail weenies.

14
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,428
He was so courageous all week,
then suddenly, tonight, stage fright.

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,354
Really, Judah, you were fine
till you got home from work today.

16
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,679
- Any mail?
- It's exactly where I left it this morning.

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,830
I haven't had a free second all day.

18
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,118
If you're gonna take a shower, you better
do it, because I have to use it, too.

19
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,149
I dread making that speech tonight.

20
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,633
Dear Miriam Rosenthal.

21
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,759
I'm at the lowest point of my life
as I write you this letter.

22
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,035
I wish to cause no suffering

23
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,638
but, because I'm going through pure hell,
I ask if you can meet me one time.

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,996
Your husband and l
are more than intimate friends

25
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,834
and have been deeply in love
for over two years now.

26
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,350
This must be faced, as there are so many
ramifications and complications.

27
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,079
Many promises were made, etc.

28
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,350
I need an open exchange
with you to clear things.

29
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,431
For all three of us to go on,

30
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:39,559
the situation has got to be
confronted in some fashion.

31
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,632
Please contact me at this number.

32
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,950
I want what's best for everyone.

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,031
Dolores Paley.

34
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,150
That the new ophthalmology wing is now
a reality is not just a tribute to me,

35
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,789
but to a spirit of community, generosity,

36
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,791
of mutual caring

37
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,791
and answered prayers.

38
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,315
Now, it's funny I use the term "answered
prayers". You see, I'm a man of science.

39
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,391
I've always been a sceptic.

40
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,395
But I was raised quite religiously.
And while I challenged it, even as a child,

41
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,472
some of that feeling
must have stuck with me.

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,154
I remember my father telling me
"The eyes of God are on us always."

43
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,989
The eyes of God.

44
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,753
What a phrase to a young boy.

45
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,593
I mean, what were God's eyes like?

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,673
Unimaginably penetrating,
intense eyes, I assumed.

47
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:02,915
And I wonder if it was just a coincidence
that I made my specialty ophthalmology.

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,836
I'm so proud of you, Judah.
Sharon is. We all are.

49
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,593
Let's get one of
Miriam and Judah together.

50
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,749
- Why did you write that letter?
- You know why.

51
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,436
- You wanna destroy my life? My family?
- I want her to know what you're like.

52
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,116
It was lying on the table all day.
By a miracle, I got it first.

53
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,158
You told me over and over again
you'd leave Miriam.

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,639
- I didn't!
- You did!

55
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,393
- I gave up business opportunities.
- Pipe dreams.

56
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,392
- And other men wanted me.
- What do you want from me?

57
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,756
- You think this was easy?
- I want what you told me you wanted.

58
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,593
T o be together. Otherwise
I don't know what I'll do.

59
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,750
I'll jump out the window, I swear!

60
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,958
You've been my whole life for two years.
I can't go back to the way things were.

61
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,474
I was at a low point when we met.
You changed that.

62
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,438
I never said I'd leave Miriam.
It's wishful thinking.

63
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,671
"There's no passion. It's boring."
Those are your words.

64
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,719
Unless you were lying to me
or there's more to this that I don't know.

65
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,314
- Have you met someone else?
- What? Oh, come on.

66
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,790
- For God's sake, Dolores. Dolores...
- What?

67
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,476
Now, look. I've lived with her 25 years.
The roots are very deep.

68
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,471
I can't go on leading two lives.

69
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,111
Well, you're not doing her any favour by
pretending. I'm not gonna be without you.

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,909
I'm not gonna let this happen to me
without a fight. I wanna speak to Miriam.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,468
- Dolores, nothing is happening. All right?
- No!

72
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,997
Yes! Now listen to me, please. Just
bear with me. We'll work something out.

73
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,071
Let me get my thoughts together.

74
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,355
Just don't do anything rash.

75
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,431
Dolores...

76
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,191
What?

77
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,871
It's gonna be OK.

78
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,032
Oh, God.

79
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,797
You were gonna throw me aside
like a squeezed lemon!

80
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,475
- Don't dramatise this!
- I've given you the best years of my life

81
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,313
and you were willing to go on and on.
Get out of here.

82
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,437
I know you for what you are.
I'm lucky I found you out.

83
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,511
Those are my clothes!

84
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,116
That was great, wasn't it?
With the tuxedos and the evening gowns.

85
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,555
- Great.
- It was wonderful to live like that.

86
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,792
This is awful. Let me see
if I can get a cab. You stay here.

87
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,470
- Wanna see a movie again tomorrow?
- Sure, Uncle Cliff.

88
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,959
Jesus.

89
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,157
Unless... Maybe we should make it
a museum day. You know?

90
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,836
I promised your father on his deathbed
I'd give you a well-rounded education.

91
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,708
We probably shouldn't go to the movies
every day, just once in a while.

92
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,633
Even though I'd love to. You know?

93
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,315
So while we wait for a cab,
I'll give you your lesson for today. OK?

94
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,474
Your lesson is this: don't listen
to what your schoolteachers tell you.

95
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,599
Just see what they look like. That's how
you'll know what life is gonna be like.

96
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,989
You heard it here first. I think I see a cab.

97
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:20,234
If we run quickly, we can kick the crutch
from that old lady and get it.

98
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,874
- I'm back!
- Where were you?

99
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,712
You know. Just out and around.

100
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,352
- You took your niece to the movies again.
- I'm crazy about that kid. She's just great.

101
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,115
My brother's in town. He wants us
to join him for a dinner party tonight.

102
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,315
Jesus.

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,551
- Please. You gonna make another scene?
- I didn't last time.

104
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,712
You did. You were not nice
and your resentment showed.

105
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,791
I don't resent him. I told you that.

106
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,031
I think he's a pompous ass.
You don't see it 'cos you love him.

107
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,031
- What are you muttering?
- Nothing.

108
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,236
You are. You're running down Lester.

109
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,915
- Hey, I like your brother Ben.
- Sure. You're not jealous of Ben.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,719
You think I'm jealous of Lester
cos he's a TV producer?

111
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,635
No, because he's a much-honoured,
highly respected multimillionaire.

112
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,635
- And he does what you'd like to be doing.
- I can't watch his stuff. It's sub-mental.

113
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:13,076
- He wants to talk to you about a job.
- I don't need a job.

114
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:16,038
I got honourable mention
at that festival in... in...

115
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,033
Cincinnati? The documentary film
festival? This is what you're clinging to?

116
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,680
Everybody got honourable mention
who showed up.

117
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,638
Boy, things have really
changed around here.

118
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,792
Wendy, Cliff, come here.
I want you to meet Lisa.

119
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,269
My sister Wendy.
My brother-in-law Clifford.

120
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,715
Lisa Crosley.
She's starring in my new series.

121
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,360
- Not really starring.
- You're one of the stars.

122
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,829
It's an ensemble.
Tell 'em who you're playing.

123
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,434
- Hello, Lester.
- Hi, darling. So glad you came.

124
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,592
Thank you for inviting me.
It's a beautiful party.

125
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,911
Thank you. Why don't you have a drink?
Be right there.

126
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,231
She gave a bundle
to the Museum of Broadcasting.

127
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,792
She plays a...

128
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,271
A lawyer for the ACLU, with a husband
who writes for a conservative magazine.

129
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,115
- It gives us a chance to get into issues.
- We'll try to be fair but, knowing Lester,

130
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,237
- it'll be heavily slanted to the left.
- Let's hope so.

131
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,598
- You know we're gonna shoot it here?
- You'll be here? I couldn't be happier.

132
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,671
Me, too. I love this town.

133
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:24,469
Out there it's such a Mickey Mouse
environment. I'm not interested.

134
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,949
- That's why I'm in this week.
- Hello, Lester.

135
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,634
I wanna talk to you. Don't go away.

136
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,395
A bunch of us are getting together
to build major studio space

137
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,630
for production right here in the city.

138
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,837
In fact... I'm sorry.
Just give me one second.

139
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,638
Idea for series:

140
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,840
A wealthy builder always trying to realise
grandiose dreams a la Donald Trump.

141
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,115
- T o be shot in New York.
- Look who's here.

142
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,237
This is my brother Ben.
Ben. Carol. Come here.

143
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,149
Hi, Cliff.

144
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,755
- How are your eyes?
- Not so good. It's not so optimistic.

145
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:04,037
- You're kidding.
- I've been seeing Dr Rosenthal.

146
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:07,237
Lester, I'm sorry. Don't you
want to talk to Clifford?

147
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,356
Yeah. Step into my office.

148
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,915
- Hi. I'm Lisa.
- Hi. We didn't meet. I'm sorry.

149
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,710
So, are you in TV, too?

150
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,314
No. No, I'm a rabbi.

151
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,353
You don't have to wear
an outfit or anything?

152
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,872
Public television wants
to do a documentary on me.

153
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,679
Follow me around,
the way I talk, the way I think.

154
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,513
It's part of their Creative Mind series.

155
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,955
So... I told them about you.

156
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,635
Thank you. But I'm workin'
on a thing of my own. A little film.

157
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,158
Yeah, Wendy told me. A film about some
philosophy professor, which is admirable.

158
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,916
But I'm offering you the chance to earn
decent money and reach a big audience.

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,197
The last thing you need
is for me to be your biographer.

160
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:56,114
I make these little films
on toxic waste and starving children...

161
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,397
Look, I'll be frank with you.
You're not my first choice.

162
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,359
I'm doing this for Wendy. She says
you haven't worked in a long time.

163
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,954
I've worked. It's just that
nobody's paying me.

164
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,670
Look, I know you don't respect what I do.
But I've got a closet full of Emmys.

165
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,275
OK, you think that's bullshit. Fine.
I understand.

166
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,591
I don't know. Maybe I could
use the money to finish my movie.

167
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,636
I do have some debts and things.

168
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,438
Idea for farce:

169
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,229
A poor loser agrees to do
the story of a great man's life

170
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,437
and in the process
comes to learn deep values.

171
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,353
- What are you doing in Boston?
- I'm lecturing at a symposium.

172
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,954
Incidentally, my name's Dolores.

173
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,712
- Hello, Dolores.
- Hello.

174
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,916
- Pretty name.
- Thank you very much.

175
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,755
- Do you go to Boston often?
- Not very often, no.

176
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:50,197
- I don't know anyone in Boston, actually.
- Really?

177
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,748
- Good morning.
- Hi. Miss Paley called. Said it was urgent.

178
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,835
Why did you phone me?
I told you I'd call you.

179
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,635
I couldn't help it.
I was going out of my skin.

180
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,837
I have to see you later. I have to.

181
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,671
OK.

182
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,797
After work is OK.

183
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,990
I see it.

184
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,674
Yeah. I see it.

185
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,671
Oh, God.

186
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,271
What?

187
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,791
I need to take a minute.

188
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,911
What's wrong, Judah?

189
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,831
I'm in such trouble, Ben.

190
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,275
What is it?

191
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,874
I need to talk to someone.

192
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,269
Sure.

193
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,239
We've known each other many years.
You're a religious man. OK, I'm not.

194
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,359
We've differed on many points,
but you're somebody I do respect.

195
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,874
- May I confide in you?
- Of course.

196
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
Go ahead. Everything's confidential.

197
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,150
I've done a foolish thing.

198
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,629
Senseless, vain, dumb.

199
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,791
Another woman.

200
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,511
Maybe I was flattered, vulnerable.

201
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,070
Maybe because she was
helpless and alone.

202
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,549
Now my life's about to go up in smoke.

203
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,589
- Can't you break it off?
- The woman won't allow it.

204
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,673
She's young. She's very unstable.
She's an hysteric.

205
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,077
And vindictive.

206
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,392
And it's my fault.
I instigated it. I prolonged it.

207
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,197
Many times I tried to back off
but I was too weak.

208
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,748
But I promised her nothing.

209
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,752
Or did l?
See, I don't even know any more.

210
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,229
In the heat of passion, you say things.

211
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,070
But, after two years of
shameful deceit in this double life,

212
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,153
I awakened as if from a dream
and realised what I'd be losing.

213
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,553
It's called wisdom.
It comes to some suddenly.

214
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:24,349
We realise the difference between
what's real and deep and lasting

215
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,955
versus the superficial
payoff of the moment.

216
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,192
You know, I kidded myself about
loving her but deep down I knew.

217
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:37,115
And knowing, I behaved selfishly.
For pleasure, for adventure, for lust.

218
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:42,149
Sometimes, when there's real love
and true acknowledgement of a mistake,

219
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,800
there can be forgiveness, too.

220
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,631
I know Miriam.

221
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:51,508
Her values, her feelings. Our place
among our friends and colleagues.

222
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,910
But what choice do you have
if the woman is going to tell her?

223
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,039
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding.

224
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,112
Maybe Miriam was responsible
in some ways, too.

225
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,078
You have to discuss it
and hope for the best.

226
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,034
Maybe you can never
go back to the old life,

227
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,750
but maybe there's a new one with
maturity and understanding. Maybe...

228
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,831
Maybe even a richer one.

229
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,591
You know what's funny?

230
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,671
Our entire adult lives,

231
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:25,629
you and I have been having this same
conversation in one form or another.

232
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,757
It's a fundamental difference
in the way we view the world.

233
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,628
You see it as harsh and
empty of values and pitiless,

234
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,511
and I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

235
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,195
a moral structure with real meaning and

236
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,840
forgiveness,
and some kind of higher power.

237
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,196
Otherwise there's no basis
to know how to live.

238
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:51,308
And I know you well enough to know that
the spark of that notion is inside you, too.

239
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,437
Now you're talkin' to me
like your congregation.

240
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,351
It's true. We went from a small infidelity
to the meaning of existence.

241
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,037
Miriam won't think two years of scheming
and dishonesty is a... is a small infidelity.

242
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,113
How can you do it? I give up.
God, you're in such wonderful shape.

243
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,395
- For a man my age?
- For any age.

244
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,598
- I was quite athletic as a young student.
- You still make love like a young student.

245
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

246
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,314
You know, I don't think
we should do this here.

247
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,518
- Why not? We're all alone.
- I don't know. I feel a little self-conscious.

248
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,354
Let's go back to the cottage and light
a fire. You can play me the Schumann.

249
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,910
Schubert. Schumann is flowery.

250
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,834
Schubert is...
He reminds me of you. The sad one.

251
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,119
Schubert. God, you have to teach me all
that. I'm so ignorant in classical music.

252
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,397
I'll teach you.
Someday we'll have a lot of time.

253
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,751
Would you like a drink?

254
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,588
Yeah. Fix me whatever you're having.

255
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,719
Why'd you call the house last night
and hang up, Del?

256
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,791
I'm not playing games, Judah.

257
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,271
Just because you've decided we're
through doesn't mean I'll roll over and die.

258
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,920
What the hell happened to us? I mean...

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,039
We had a wonderful few years.
We both knew it couldn't go on for ever.

260
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,192
- I gave up things for you.
- Come on. That's poppycock.

261
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,238
Don't give me that, will ya?
For God's sakes.

262
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,630
There were no business opportunities.
It's all in your head.

263
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,950
No lovers beggin' for your hand.

264
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,315
I prevented nothing. I...

265
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,392
Can we not argue? I just wanted to talk.

266
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,471
I'm just so rattled.

267
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,991
I had an idea.

268
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,271
I thought if we could get away, just
for a little while, on one of our trips.

269
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,195
Our trips are
the warmest memories I have.

270
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,592
Not just in our relationship, but
some of the loveliest times I've ever had.

271
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,592
You're always so much more relaxed
away from home.

272
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,798
You come to life.
Your whole face changes.

273
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,998
I thought if we could just get away
to Boston or Washington,

274
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,198
- just without any preconceived notions.
- I can't go away, Del.

275
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,911
- Just a weekend.
- I can't, Del.

276
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,991
- Why not?
- I can't.

277
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,799
- You won't.
- Of course I won't. Right.

278
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,871
Why not?

279
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,351
Because you're very unrealistic.
You know that?

280
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,590
Sit... Sit down for a second. Let's talk.

281
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,351
Look. I've been...

282
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,471
I've been thinking, too.

283
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,551
And it occurs to me,

284
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:23,237
if I caused you to miss any opportunities
that might have been lucrative for you,

285
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,788
I'm perfectly prepared to reimburse you.

286
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:30,237
- I don't want to feel I've cost you any...
- I'm not after your goddamn money.

287
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,788
I want to speak to Miriam.
It's her problem, too.

288
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,270
- I want her to know the truth.
- Keep her out of it. All right?

289
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,873
I think she should know
her husband is a liar and an embezzler.

290
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,434
Don't you dare call me an embezzler.

291
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,078
I'm not blind. I know what went on with
those philanthropies and your stocks.

292
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,199
I took nothing. Not a nickel.
My conscience is completely clear.

293
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,556
You needed money
to cover your losses. I was there.

294
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,349
OK, OK. I needed some temporary help.
I mean, for Christ's sake.

295
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,719
After a life of hard work, a man doesn't
let himself go down the toilet. Does he?

296
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,872
And moving funds is not stealing.

297
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,151
Without telling anyone?

298
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,073
Every cent was accounted for,
with interest.

299
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,555
I don't think they would see it that way.

300
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:27,918
So this is what you plan on doing? You're
gonna hold on to me with threats, right?

301
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,276
Stupid threats and slander.
This is your idea of love, right?

302
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,511
I will not be tossed out.
I want to speak to Miriam.

303
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:39,799
Think, for Christ's sake! Think what
the hell you're doing to me. Please.

304
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,030
I can't figure it out.

305
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,111
I need you.

306
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,712
Del...

307
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,674
I love New York.
I was born in that building.

308
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:54,036
Behind the guy... the statue there.
The guy on the pedestal.

309
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:58,989
I love New York. It's like thousands of
straight lines just lookin' for a punch line.

310
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,559
And what makes New York
such a funny place is that

311
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,269
there's so much tension and pain
and misery and craziness here.

312
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:10,353
And that's the first part of comedy.
But you gotta get some distance from it.

313
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,230
The thing to remember about comedy is:
if it bends, it's funny.

314
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,197
If it breaks, it's not funny.

315
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,556
So you gotta get back from the pain.
See what I mean?

316
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,997
They asked me up at Harvard, a bunch
of kids asked me "What's comedy?"

317
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,675
So I said... And this is part of
what I said about getting back from it.

318
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,672
I said "Comedy is tragedy plus time."

319
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,551
Tragedy plus time.

320
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,430
The night Lincoln was shot, you couldn't
make a joke about it. You just couldn't.

321
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,557
Now, time has gone by,
and now it's fair game.

322
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,356
See what I mean? It's tragedy plus time.

323
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,477
- OK, we're out.
- That's it? So fast?

324
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,114
I shot up ten rolls on your first question.

325
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,115
I've gotta get to CBS anyway.
We'll start this again tomorrow.

326
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,714
Just remember what I was saying.
What do you think?

327
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,712
- Excellent. Absolutely.
- I think I'm too cute.

328
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,031
I'll be more relaxed tomorrow.
I'll do that tragedy stuff.

329
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,795
- This is Halley Reed for Mr. Kurnitz.
- Would you excuse me one second?

330
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,350
Listen, if you play your cards right,
you could have my body.

331
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,468
- Wouldn't you rather leave it to science?
- I offer you my heart, you squash it.

332
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,075
Come on. When are you gonna quit
this organisation, come work for me?

333
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,869
- You'd fire me. I'm much too opinionated.
- No, no.

334
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,997
- That's OK. I'll wait.
- I like mental stimulation.

335
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,231
- You tried shock therapy?
- That's good. That's funny.

336
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,029
- Listen, Lester. We've gotta go.
- OK. I'll be right with you.

337
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,270
- It's five o'clock.
- Wait in the car.

338
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,432
- Would you please come?
- Yes. Wait in the car, Arthur.

339
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,671
Yes, I was holding for Mr. Kurnitz,
please. It's Halley Reed.

340
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,320
Why don't you come with me
down to Barbados?

341
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,391
We'll swim, we'll get some sun.

342
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,471
Sorry. I freckle.

343
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,835
That's my best shot. I can't do any better.

344
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,832
- That's OK. I'll wait.
- Think about it. OK? Please.

345
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,911
Talk to you tomorrow.

346
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,309
Yeah, it's Halley Reed. You cut me off.

347
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,229
- OK.
- Excuse me. We haven't officially met.

348
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:15,359
- I'm Halley Reed, an associate producer.
- I'm Clifford Stern.

349
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,672
Can I ask you what I asked the producer?
What do you bother with this guy for?

350
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,639
He's such a pompous bore,
and your show does such great profiles.

351
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,429
Just between you and me,
I wanted to do Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

352
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,318
- That's perfect.
- They like a little variety.

353
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,075
- He is an American phenomenon.
- Yeah, but so is acid rain.

354
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,151
Boy, you really don't like him, do you?

355
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,073
I love him like a brother -
David Greenglass.

356
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:44,439
So why are you doing this? It's unusual
for them to bring in an outside person.

357
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,512
Yes, I know. I'm doing it
strictly for the money.

358
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,670
I'm trying to make my own documentary.

359
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,992
I'm doing a profile on a guy who'd be
absolutely perfect for your show.

360
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,514
- Yeah? Who's that?
- His name is Louis Levy.

361
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,591
Do you have a little time?

362
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,912
The unique thing that happened

363
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,150
to the early lsraelites

364
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:08,232
was that they conceived a God that cares.

365
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,837
He cares but, at the same time,

366
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,311
he also demands
that you behave morally.

367
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,391
But here comes the paradox.

368
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,314
What's one of the first things
that that God asks?

369
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,633
That God asks Abraham
to sacrifice his only son,

370
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,029
his beloved son, to him.

371
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:33,954
In other words,
in spite of millennia of efforts,

372
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,639
we have not succeeded to create
a really and entirely loving image of God.

373
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,436
This was beyond our capacity to imagine.

374
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,273
- Boy, he's really interesting.
- A fascinating guy.

375
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:52,831
- He could be wonderful for the series.
- You wanna dump Lester and do him?

376
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,753
- Cos I would love to...
- We can't dump Lester.

377
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,150
But I think I could talk them into
a little financing for you.

378
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,391
And if all this comes together right,
and it should,

379
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,790
we got some free spots
in the fall schedule.

380
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,998
Wonderful. For me to get on your series
would be such a feather in my cap.

381
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,594
That would be
the biggest audience I ever had.

382
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:15,274
Great. Let's work on it.
Let's make it happen.

383
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,911
Really? You know, even though we just
met, I've taken an instant liking to you.

384
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,718
And I to him.

385
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,832
Hi. I thought I'd come by
on my way home. I got Jenny a present.

386
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,629
- Is that you, Uncle Cliff?
- Yes, Jenny. I got you something.

387
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,951
I got you a great book,
an absolutely terrific book.

388
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,477
How are you? I got you this great book
with great pictures of old New York in it.

389
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,996
- Look at this. This is old Fifth Avenue.
- This is great.

390
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,071
Carriages and top hats. I told you.

391
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,470
There's a section on speakeasies,
which is really interesting.

392
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,393
That's the Flatiron Building,
which is very famous.

393
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,358
I'm in a great mood.
I had a creative breakthrough.

394
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,069
I heard you got some action
on your ad in the personals.

395
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:03,995
- This is the old Madison Square Garden.
- Jen... Don't you have some homework?

396
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,437
- Yeah, I have to go do that.
- We'll look at this later. Great pictures.

397
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,112
Cliff...

398
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,191
What's the matter?

399
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,475
- I'm a wreck.
- What is it?

400
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,958
- I'm a wreck.
- Barbara...

401
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,671
Barbara, what's the matter?

402
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,311
I feel sick.

403
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:28,518
- What is it?
- I've been shaking like this for days.

404
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,591
What's wrong?

405
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,991
I've been going out with this man
that I met through the personal columns.

406
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,831
Very attractive.

407
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,911
It was very nice.

408
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,551
I went out with him three times.

409
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,269
He was never fresh.
He was always a perfect gentleman.

410
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,558
So... we both came back here,

411
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,835
and Jenny was away.

412
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,474
She was sleeping over
at a friend's house.

413
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,677
And it was, like, one o 'clock
in the morning or something

414
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,149
and we both had had a little to drink.

415
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,314
You know, I wanna tie you to the bed.

416
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,436
- Really?
- And rip your dress off.

417
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,752
Have you ever been bound up,
tied up and made love to?

418
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,748
I'm.... I'm a...

419
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,831
I'm a sensible gal.

420
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,031
No more you're not.

421
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,594
God, Murray. God...

422
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,274
Barbara, I'm shocked at what I'm hearing.

423
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,193
You're my sister.
A nice, middle-class mother.

424
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,635
What are you telling me?

425
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,838
I couldn't move.
I was tied tightly to the bedposts.

426
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:54,597
Jesus. By a stra...
a guy that you didn't know?

427
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,831
And now you're gonna tell me
that he robbed you, right?

428
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,911
No.

429
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,798
He got on top of me and... and...

430
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,917
- And what?
- I can't say it. I just... I can't say it.

431
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,230
What? Tell me. What's so terrible?

432
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,994
He sat over me...
and went to the bathroom.

433
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,431
That's so disgusting!

434
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,671
Oh, my God! That's the worst thing
I ever heard in my life.

435
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,311
- Then he took his clothes and left.
- Barbara! You idiot!

436
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,437
This guy could've cut your throat!
Murdered you!

437
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,478
- I would've preferred it.
- Jesus. You're such a dope!

438
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,074
I wish I could have sympathy for this.

439
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,516
That's so easy for you to say,
but I'm so lonely.

440
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,229
You don't know what it's like
to be by yourself all the time.

441
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,754
I'm sure you're lonely. I know it's painful.

442
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,516
But promise me that you're never gonna
place another ad again. It's ridiculous!

443
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,594
My whole life is passing me by,
and I don't have anyone to love.

444
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,434
I know that's so hard for you
to comprehend because you're married.

445
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,511
But it's so lonely out there.

446
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,559
I mean, you have a wife,
and you love her, and that's so nice.

447
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,076
Let me tell you. Things are not so good
between my wife and myself,

448
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,151
just so you don't get any illusions.

449
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,834
We've been coming apart for the last year.

450
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:18,677
It's just that neither of us has the energy
to do anything about it. It's not so great.

451
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,470
A strange man defecated on my sister.

452
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,311
Why?

453
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,912
I don't know.

454
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,632
Is there any reason I could give you
that would answer that satisfactorily?

455
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,676
You know, it's just so...

456
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,799
Human sexuality is just...
it's so mysterious.

457
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:59,668
Which I guess is... you know.
I guess it's good in a way.

458
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,230
Yeah, well, I gotta be up at seven.

459
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:19,593
I knew it had to be some deep,
dark secret for you to stoop to call me,

460
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:24,595
- to actually invite me to your home.
- Jack, who should I turn to but a brother?

461
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,274
- I've been there for you.
- I'm here, aren't l?

462
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,990
Don't make sharp cracks. I didn't
stoop to call you. I'm in serious trouble.

463
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,799
She won't take money.
She won't listen to reason.

464
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,715
I even thought of telling everything to
Miriam, but she could never live with it.

465
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,190
Add to that her blabbing
about my financial indiscretions.

466
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,510
Not that I stole, but I was indiscreet.

467
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,434
And, if they look hard enough,
who knows what they'll find?

468
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:53,798
- What would you like me to do?
- I don't know, but she's killing me.

469
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,235
Want me to have somebody talk to her?

470
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,788
- Like what?
- Straighten her out.

471
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,877
What do you mean? Threaten her?
That's all I need.

472
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,110
How else do you expect
to keep her quiet?

473
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,192
I don't know. Jack, I don't know.

474
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,070
- Well...
- Christ, Jack. What are you suggesting?

475
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,431
What did you call me for?

476
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,875
I don't know. I hoped you'd have
more experience with something like this.

477
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,954
You called because you need some dirty
work done. That's all you ever call for.

478
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,511
Look how bitter you are.

479
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,317
You've staked me plenty of times.
I don't forget my obligations.

480
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,392
Threatening will only make it worse, Jack.

481
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,313
OK. Forget about it.
What do you want me to say?

482
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:46,359
How the hell can I forget about it?
I'm fighting for my life.

483
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,432
This woman's gonna destroy
everything I've built.

484
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,469
That's what I'm saying. If she won't listen
to reason, then you go on to the next step.

485
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:57,358
Threats? Violence?
What are we talking about here?

486
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,558
She can be gotten rid of. I know people.
Money'll buy whatever's necessary.

487
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,359
I won't even comment on that.
That's mind-boggling.

488
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,590
What did you want me to do
when you called me?

489
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,672
Not to do dirty work,
despite what you think.

490
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,152
Anyway, it's gone beyond
just Miriam now.

491
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,395
She's talking financial doings.

492
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,909
I'm out of ideas. I don't know what l
expected from you, Jack, but some help.

493
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,231
You know, you're not aware of
what goes on in this world.

494
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:32,519
You sit up here with your four acres and
your country club and your rich friends.

495
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,831
- Out there in the real world, it's different.
- Come on.

496
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:39,276
- I've met a lot of characters...
- I've heard these stories before.

497
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,635
..from Seventh Avenue, from Atlantic City.

498
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:47,670
And I'm not so high-class that I can avoid
looking at reality. I can't afford to be aloof.

499
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:52,231
You come to me with a hell of a problem,
and then you get high-handed on me.

500
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,954
I don't mean to be high-handed.
I haven't been sleeping. I'm irritable.

501
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,235
OK. Forget I said anything.

502
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,074
Let me just get something straight here.

503
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,551
Am I understanding you right?

504
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,629
Are you suggesting getting rid of her?

505
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,350
You won't be involved.
But I'll need some cash.

506
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,149
What will they do?

507
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,629
What'll they do? They'll handle it.

508
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,472
I can't believe I'm talking about
a human being. She's not an insect.

509
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,551
You don't just step on her.

510
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:41,076
I know. Playing hardball
was never your game.

511
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:43,230
You never liked to get your hands dirty.

512
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:48,314
But, apparently, this woman is for real,
and this thing isn't just gonna go away.

513
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,671
I can't do it.

514
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,111
I can't think that way.

515
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,474
Don't tell me.
I don't wanna know anything about it.

516
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,710
This is a work of art.

517
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:15,759
The ropes come off. I tie sash weights
to her ankles with soft catgut.

518
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,991
- Please! That's a horrible word.
- Get the angle on this.

519
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,594
She disappears. Two weeks, maybe three.

520
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:26,435
Then up she pops. None of this stuff
on her any more, no marks. A suicide.

521
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:29,593
- Now isn't that beautiful?
- It's loathsome.

522
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,069
- Be sure no one sees you.
- Don 't worry.

523
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,799
This only happens in the movies.

524
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,919
Listen, we should get back.
Lester's gonna be leaving the hotel soon.

525
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,028
We'll make it. We've been shooting Lester
all week. I'm tired of it. We'll catch him.

526
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,432
I shouldn't have told you my weakness
is going to the movies in the daytime.

527
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,718
I go all the time with my niece.
It's wonderful. It's like playing hooky.

528
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,030
You said that yesterday and we were late.

529
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,714
We weren't late. We didn't miss anything.

530
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,951
Have another cheeseburger.
It's our lunch hour.

531
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:06,278
I've got everyone up at the network
very excited over Professor Levy.

532
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,828
I have some great stuff to show you later.

533
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,751
Listen.

534
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,831
I bought you a present.

535
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,629
Great. Now I can get rid of
my few remaining teeth.

536
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,632
~ Happy birthday to you

537
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,952
~ Happy birthday to you

538
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,912
A treadmill. Are you trying
to tell me something?

539
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,629
- You said you were bored with the bike.
- You may find this just as boring.

540
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,554
- I think you're in great shape already.
- Yeah, for a man my age.

541
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,871
Great to see you enjoying yourself.
You've been so depressed.

542
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,872
This thing's great for tension.

543
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,953
- I'll go get it.
- It's just like the one you saw at the club.

544
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,593
- Where are we gonna put this?
- I'm gonna have 20 men take it upstairs.

545
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,990
- It looks like a kinetic sculpture.
- It's not gonna stay down here.

546
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,277
- It tells you how many calories...
- Dad, it's for you.

547
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,351
Miss Paley.

548
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,038
- She's a patient.
- On this phone?

549
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:07,157
Yeah. She's going through a crisis.
I'll be right back.

550
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,755
- Why couldn't the service pick it up?
- It's probably an emergency.

551
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,989
I'm calling from the gas station
down the road from your house.

552
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,469
I can be there in five minutes.

553
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,996
I'm going to,
unless you meet me right now.

554
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,873
No, Judah. No, Judah.

555
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,635
No. I wanna talk to you in person,
or I'm coming over.

556
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,112
- Just calm down, OK?
- You said we were going away.

557
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,794
I wanna be alone with you.
And when we get back,

558
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,429
I want you to bring everything
to a conclusion with Miriam.

559
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,638
I can't go on like this! I can't wait for ever!
You don't know what it's like!

560
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,474
Maybe it would help if you
talked to somebody, like a therapist.

561
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,632
Don't trick me, Judah! Christ, I'm shaking.

562
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,471
Listen.

563
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,115
I brought you a birthday present.

564
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,149
I know how much you love Schubert.

565
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,875
Sometimes, when there's real love
and true acknowledgement of a mistake,

566
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,349
there can be forgiveness, too.

567
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,311
I know Miriam.

568
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:45,154
Her values, her feelings. Our place
among our friends and colleagues.

569
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,630
But what choice do you have
if the woman is going to tell her?

570
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,679
You have to confess the wrong
and hope for understanding.

571
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,718
I couldn't go on living
if I didn't feel with all my heart

572
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,349
a moral structure with real meaning and

573
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:02,079
forgiveness,
and some kind of higher power.

574
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,357
Otherwise,
there 's no basis to know how to live.

575
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,514
And I know you well enough to know that
the spark of that notion is inside you, too.

576
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,514
Could you really go through with it?

577
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,234
What choice do I have, Ben?

578
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,311
T ell me.

579
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:29,313
Give the people that you've hurt
a chance to forgive you.

580
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,790
Miriam won't forgive me. She'll be broken.

581
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,871
She worships me.

582
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:40,877
She'll be humiliated before our friends.
This woman plans to make a stink.

583
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,880
- Did you make promises to her?
- No.

584
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,232
Maybe I led her on more than I realised.

585
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,993
She's so emotionally hungry.

586
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:56,949
- But it's deeper than just Miriam now.
- Meaning financial improprieties?

587
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,190
No.

588
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,478
Maybe l... Maybe I did
make some questionable moves.

589
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,515
Only you would know that, Judah.

590
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,591
I don't any more, Ben.

591
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,872
Sometimes it's worse than...
worse than jail.

592
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,511
It's a human life.

593
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,795
You don't think God sees?

594
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,795
God is a luxury I can't afford.

595
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,678
Now you're talking like your brother Jack.

596
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,189
Jack lives in the real world.

597
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,669
You live in the kingdom of heaven.

598
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:42,675
I managed to keep free of that real world
but... suddenly it's found me.

599
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:47,958
You fool around with her for pleasure
and then, when you think it's enough,

600
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,429
you wanna sweep her under the rug?

601
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,958
There's no other solution but Jack's, Ben.

602
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,156
I push one button and
I can sleep again nights.

603
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,231
Could you sleep with that?

604
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,239
Is that who you really are?

605
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:08,596
I will not be destroyed
by this neurotic woman.

606
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,631
But the law, Judah.

607
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,554
Without the law, it's all darkness.

608
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,835
You sound like my father.

609
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,436
What good is the law if it prevents me
from receiving justice?

610
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:30,028
Is what she's doing to me just?
Is this what I deserve?

611
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,191
Jack? It's Judah.

612
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,117
I think we should move ahead
with what we discussed.

613
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,268
How much will you need?

614
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,511
Not funny. It's not funny, guys.

615
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,309
No, it's not. You're not thinking funny.
You gotta think with your ear.

616
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,598
Do you understand what I'm telling you?
Here's the difference. It's very easy.

617
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,989
If it bends, it's funny.

618
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,435
If it breaks, it's not funny.

619
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,909
It's very simple. Wait a minute. Here.

620
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,310
- Jeff, this is Alva.
- Hi. Pleased to meet you.

621
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,391
Don't... Don't shoot this part.

622
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:42,230
Alva will play a small part in the new
series. I don't know what. I just want her.

623
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,675
- It's wonderful. You look great.
- Thank you.

624
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,194
They love you. Wonderful. Be right out.

625
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:51,958
OK. Don't do that while they're shooting.
It's messing my hair up.

626
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:55,589
Understand what I'm saying?
Think of Oedipus. Oedipus is funny.

627
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,955
That's the structure of funny, right there.

628
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:01,396
"Who did this terrible thing?"
"Oh, God - it was me." That's funny.

629
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,554
But the difference is... Not while they're
shooting. What the hell are you doing?

630
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:12,476
You will notice that what we are aiming at

631
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:16,275
when we fall in love
is a very strange paradox.

632
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,998
The paradox consists of the fact
that, when we fall in love,

633
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,311
we are seeking to re-find

634
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,713
all or some of the people
to whom we were attached as children.

635
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,031
On the other hand, we ask our beloved

636
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:36,711
to correct all of the wrongs

637
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,954
that these early parents or siblings
inflicted upon us.

638
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:45,191
So that love contains in it
the contradiction:

639
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,874
the attempt to return to the past

640
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,918
and the attempt to undo the past.

641
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:55,076
See? No limos, no bimbos,
no awards or anything.

642
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,674
This guy's just a thinker, an intellect.

643
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,595
I was just thinking, when you show this to
the people that make the final decision,

644
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,433
you should emphasise
his overall view of life.

645
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,433
It's great. It's life-affirming.
They love a positive statement.

646
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,435
See, this is what I need. A little interest
in my work. A little encouragement. It's...

647
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:18,877
Let me ask you something. I got a bottle
of champagne as a prize, from Paris.

648
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,512
I got honourable mention for a little
documentary I did on leukaemia, and...

649
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:28,832
- You want some champagne?
- I never say no to champagne, or caviar.

650
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:33,835
OK. That's perfect. I have no caviar.
I have oat bran. It's better for your heart.

651
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,636
He was very eloquent on the subject
of love, didn't you think?

652
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,837
Yeah. I wish I'd read him
before I got married. You know?

653
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,150
Would've saved me
a gall bladder operation.

654
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,674
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

655
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,548
You know, he wrote a very interesting
book on human relationships.

656
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,712
He speaks very, very highly
of love at first sight.

657
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,397
My ex-husband and I fell in love at first
sight. I should've taken a second look.

658
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,358
No. Actually, it was my fault
as much as his.

659
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,716
I notice you still wear a wedding ring.
Any reason for that?

660
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,793
Well... I don't know. I guess
I'm just not ready to take it off.

661
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:15,195
It's good. It keeps me
from being asked out on dates.

662
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,955
You must have had a terrible marriage
if you don't want any dates.

663
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:23,352
Well, no... I mean, he was great.
He was very brilliant. He's an architect.

664
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,431
Real handsome and everything.

665
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,036
But if you're gonna have an affair, not
with my best friend in my four-poster bed.

666
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:33,237
And they didn't have to finish
all my pistachio nuts.

667
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,311
That inconsiderate?

668
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,960
I hope it hasn't soured you
on marriage or men.

669
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,238
- I can hear myself sounding like a bore.
- Just the opposite. Hello.

670
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,709
Yeah, she's here. How'd you know?

671
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,477
Hold on one second.

672
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,551
It's Lester.

673
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:52,118
Hello.

674
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,111
Yeah?

675
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,191
Sure, if you want me to.

676
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,235
OK. At the office? At what time?

677
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,437
- Nine?
- Nine o'clock? The building'll be dark.

678
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,274
The floor's dark. There's nobody
at the office. The office is closed.

679
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:08,590
You'll be in a dark room with Lester.

680
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,148
Yeah, the office is
kind of spooky at nine o'clock.

681
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:14,312
- Definitely.
- Sure. The hotel's even nearer.

682
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,278
- Don't go to the hotel.
- What was that?

683
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:19,351
OK. Room 1911. Sure.

684
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,635
OK, I'll see you there. OK.

685
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,077
You're not gonna go to the hotel with him.
It's crazy. I'd better go with you.

686
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,755
- Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
- He won't keep his hands off you.

687
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,913
He'll get you in a room, read you your
Miranda rights and tear your clothes off.

688
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,754
- He wants to produce something of mine.
- Your first child.

689
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,355
I've never been seduced by a guy
who wears loafers and no socks.

690
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,433
- Much less one who says "nucular".
- He also says "foilage".

691
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,876
- I don't like this.
- Why have you got Singin' in the Rain?

692
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,951
It's the one print that I own.

693
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,239
It's a very good 16mm print. I play it every
couple of months to get my spirits up.

694
00:46:56,320 --> 00:47:00,393
You know, I saw it I don't know how many
years ago. I remember loving it.

695
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,675
They play it on television frequently.

696
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,275
You wanna watch it? I could
play it on this thing reel by reel.

697
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,954
- Wanna have dinner?
- Don't you have anything to do?

698
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,794
No, no. And, you know,
you got till nine o'clock.

699
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:17,874
Why not? There's an lndian restaurant
right near. I'll send out. We could...

700
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:22,472
~ All I do is dream of you
the whole night through

701
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,790
~ With the dawn, I still go on
dreaming of you

702
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,189
I love this lndian food.

703
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,033
It's great.
Want some more tandoori mouse?

704
00:47:32,120 --> 00:47:33,838
Just kidding.

705
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:37,276
- You want some of the curry?
- Too hot, too hot.

706
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,911
My teeth are melting.

707
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,117
Boy, this is the perfect way
to see this movie.

708
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,671
It's great, isn't it?

709
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,957
When you see Lester later, be careful.

710
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,877
This guy tells you
he wants to exchange ideas

711
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,758
when what he wants is to exchange fluids.

712
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,912
- Yes?
- I have a delivery of some flowers.

713
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:53,876
So Chris and you
can't agree on your honeymoon.

714
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:57,748
We can agree. We've talked about a lot
of different places. It's just that...

715
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:02,197
I told Chris, and I told you before,
I want to go someplace warm.

716
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,069
But I also wanna do things like hike...

717
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:10,550
- You know, I hadn't thought of Australia.
- Not Australia.

718
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:14,633
I should've done what my friends told me.
Just go where we first wanted to go.

719
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,793
- Where did you first wanna go?
- We wanted to go to ltaly.

720
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,838
Dad, it's Jack. He's on the phone.

721
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,593
- Who?
- Jack.

722
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,275
Well, go to Venice, Florence, Rome,
and do what you want to.

723
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:32,353
We can have sun, we can have snow,
we can have everything we want.

724
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:38,873
- All my friends have gone to ltaly.
- You won't go there cos your friends did?

725
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:42,157
I just wanted you to know
everything came out fine.

726
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:45,312
It's over and done with,
so you can forget about it.

727
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,751
Oh, my God.

728
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,471
Oh, my God.

729
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:52,835
I'm in shock, Jack.

730
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:56,833
Judah, I'm telling you,
it's like the whole thing never existed.

731
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,912
It's a small burglary. Nothing more.

732
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,992
Yeah. So go on back to your life
and... put it behind you.

733
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,391
I can't speak.

734
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,031
I need a drink.

735
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:16,313
What am I gonna do?
I've got guests here now.

736
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,829
Jack... God have mercy on us, Jack.

737
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,832
Mom, you told me that Mary
has been having acupuncture.

738
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,434
- She's tried it.
- Yeah, for a few months.

739
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:14,476
She hasn't gone back. She stopped.

740
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:18,712
Is everything OK, sweetheart?
You look kind of upset.

741
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,234
I'm fine. It's just Jack.

742
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,108
She still wears a collar when she drives.
She can't look around.

743
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:30,911
- But it's done a lot. I'd consider trying it.
- What about Oriental medicine?

744
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,437
I have a friend who consulted
a Chinese physician with an eye problem.

745
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:38,353
And he inserted a cat's whisker
into her tear duct.

746
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:41,432
She's been tellin' this story all week long.

747
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,515
- Well, it cured her.
- It did?

748
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:48,478
But you told me also he uses wires, too.

749
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,994
In acupuncture, you use needles.

750
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:54,470
- But very fine.
- That's a different procedure.

751
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:56,551
What do you think, Judah?

752
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,637
Judah?

753
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,756
Judah, what do you think?

754
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:03,831
I think I've done

755
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,309
a terrible thing.

756
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,391
What's wrong, honey?

757
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,913
I...

758
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,993
I left these papers at the office
which I absolutely need tonight.

759
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,278
I can't believe I did this. How negligent
of me. I've never done this before.

760
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:23,797
- I've got a major conference tomorrow...
- No, darling, you can't get them tonight.

761
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:26,440
I have to because
I've got an hour's work to do.

762
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:31,514
- But we're in the middle of a dinner party.
- I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

763
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,434
- Don't apologise.
- I don't like him driving at night.

764
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:39,752
Stanley, I'm so sorry about this,
but I have to get these papers.

765
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,308
- Would you like some company?
- No, not at all.

766
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,039
- Darling, forgive me.
- Chris will take you.

767
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:49,159
It was a wonderful evening,
and if you're here when I get back...

768
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:51,515
- Thank you.
- Don't worry. We're fine.

769
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:57,869
I do apologise. Let's just finish the coffee,
sit down and... he'll be back.

770
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,871
I'll say it once again:

771
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:08,713
the eyes of God see all.

772
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:13,751
Listen to me, Judah. There is
absolutely nothing that escapes his sight.

773
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:16,912
He sees the righteous
and he sees the wicked.

774
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,355
And the righteous will be rewarded,

775
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,000
but the wicked will be punished

776
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,071
for eternity.

777
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,557
Hello?

778
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,871
Hello?

779
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,471
Hello. Hello?

780
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,351
I want your opinion. I'm doing a special
on jazz. I'd like to know what you think.

781
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,353
I admire her opinion so. Did you tell him
I wanna produce your idea for a series?

782
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,998
- No.
- It's great.

783
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,631
She wants to do a different Chekhov story
every month. He wrote a million of 'em.

784
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,518
- That's very sweet of you.
- I'm putty in your hands.

785
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,036
- What'll I do with a handful of putty?
- She's always got a zinger.

786
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:46,111
This vixen, this minx.

787
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,637
We should be going cos we have to pick
up those airsick bags we talked about.

788
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,472
I've got to get up at dawn

789
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:55,836
and teach Emily Dickinson to
upper-middle-class crack addicts.

790
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,514
- One of my favourite poets.
- Me, too.

791
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,070
- Because I could not stop for Death...
- He kindly stopped for me.

792
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:04,151
The word "kindly", right?

793
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:08,028
The carriage held but just ourselves
And lmmortality.

794
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:11,112
We slowly drove, he knew no haste,
And I had put away

795
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:14,078
My labour, and my leisure too,
For his civility.

796
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:17,550
- Lester was a great English student.
- Not that I graduated.

797
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:21,713
It's amazing. I couldn't graduate, and
the same school now teaches a course

798
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,394
in existential motifs
in my situation comedies.

799
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,313
- Really?
- Where'd you go to college, Halley?

800
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,550
- Columbia.
- You went to Columbia?

801
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,997
- What'd you major in?
- Law. I graduated from the law school.

802
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:37,311
- You didn't practise?
- Yes, I did. But then, you know,

803
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:41,075
I met my husband and...
we moved to Europe for a while.

804
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,310
It's a long, boring story.

805
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,709
I wish you'd go back to your old job.

806
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,791
I used to edit newsreel footage so...

807
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:51,589
You know, floods and fires
and famines. It's depressing.

808
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:54,832
- We don't all have to go, you know.
- No, I do.

809
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,230
We'll go. You two stay.
You have business to talk over, right?

810
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:01,039
- I could go with you, if you like.
- Let's just go, OK?

811
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:04,317
- Let's go someplace quiet for a drink.
- I wouldn't mind that.

812
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,676
- I'm just exhausted.
- From what? It's early.

813
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:09,830
- Some other time.
- One little drink.

814
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,309
Really. Some other time.

815
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:16,031
Jesus. Lester was so pushy tonight.

816
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:19,396
He comes on with Halley like
it's business, but he's after her.

817
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:22,153
Oh, please. She really likes him. I can tell.

818
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,710
- You've gotta be kidding. She likes him?
- What's not to like?

819
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,430
- He's attractive, he's rich, he's charming.
- He's your brother. You're prejudiced.

820
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:34,069
She put him down pretty good
when he said "Let's go have a drink."

821
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:36,993
I loved the way she said
"Some other time."

822
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:40,914
- Fine. Enough already.
- That was pretty witty.

823
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:45,630
- What makes you think she likes him?
- Didn't you see her staring at him?

824
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,029
She probably can't believe her eyes.

825
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,793
You wouldn't pick up on it
if it hit you over the head.

826
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:53,519
You're not at all romantic.
That's the problem.

827
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:56,592
Hey, honey, you're the one
who stopped sleeping with me.

828
01:00:56,680 --> 01:01:00,992
It'll be a year on April 20. I remember the
date exactly, cos it was Hitler's birthday.

829
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:04,311
I'm not discussing that any more.
I don't wanna talk about it.

830
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,550
I'll bet she's having a drink with him now.

831
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,677
For how much?
I'm serious. For how much?

832
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:12,149
You really know how to get my goat!

833
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,511
Hi. It's Clifford.

834
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:40,591
Yes, I knew you'd be in.

835
01:01:40,680 --> 01:01:43,399
I just... You know.
Tonight was a lot of fun.

836
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:45,471
Wasn't Lester... so silly?

837
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:49,269
I mean, the guy is so self-important.
He was pushing all night.

838
01:01:49,360 --> 01:01:51,749
I was frankly embarrassed for him.

839
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:57,711
What is he doing there?

840
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,834
You're talkin' business at 12 midnight?

841
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,035
Well... Gee, that could be very dangerous.

842
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,509
You want me...
You want me to come over?

843
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:15,591
OK. If you can handle it.

844
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,669
OK. I'll see you tomorrow.

845
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:32,992
I'm completely in love with Halley,
and Lester is startin' to make his move.

846
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,594
He wants her just
for a conquest. I can tell.

847
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:38,433
You know, it's so shallow,
and I'm crazy about her.

848
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:41,990
How can I compete with the guy?
He's rich and famous and successful.

849
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:46,392
- Come on. He's no competition for you.
- God bless you for saying that.

850
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,996
But you'll find, as you go through life, that
great depth and smouldering sensuality

851
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:53,514
does not always win, I'm sorry to say.

852
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:57,149
Meanwhile, his brother Ben, the rabbi,
he's a wonderful guy.

853
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:59,356
He called me last night. He's going blind.

854
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,831
He's got a terrible eye disease.
He's gonna be blind in a few months.

855
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,957
And he's got a great attitude.
He's really a mensch.

856
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:10,151
All right. Look left.

857
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,911
Now straight ahead, Ben.

858
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:16,991
Now to the right.

859
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:19,071
That's good.

860
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:31,360
My mother said that
I should go to the doctor,

861
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,954
because I was... My eyes weren't so good.

862
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:36,110
Well, you're an ophthalmologist.

863
01:03:37,040 --> 01:03:39,838
Do you agree the eyes
are the windows of the soul?

864
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:44,038
Well, I believe they're windows,
but I'm not sure it's a soul I see.

865
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,554
My mother taught me I have a soul,

866
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,837
and it'll live on after me when I'm gone,

867
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,708
and if you look deeply enough
in my eyes, you can see it.

868
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,788
So what's the verdict?

869
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,839
Cos I'd like to get this resolved
before my daughter's wedding.

870
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:09,559
- Julie's getting married?
- Time passes quickly, doesn't it?

871
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:12,837
Remember she was just a baby?
Well, yours, too.

872
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,314
- Yes.
- Are you OK, Judah?

873
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:19,391
- Yeah.
- You don't look so good.

874
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:22,995
I'm fine.
I just haven't been sleeping that well.

875
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:28,359
Tell me... if I'm not prying... did you ever
resolve your personal difficulties?

876
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:31,231
Yes, actually.

877
01:04:31,320 --> 01:04:34,278
It resolved itself.
The woman listened to reason.

878
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,237
Did she?

879
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:39,232
That's wonderful. So you got a break.

880
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:43,598
Sometimes to have a little good luck
is the most brilliant plan.

881
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,833
Judah, relax. You're white.
You're gonna have a breakdown. It's over.

882
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,309
What do you expect me to be?
My old self?

883
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,630
I jump when the phone rings.

884
01:04:52,720 --> 01:04:56,759
- No good can come of this, Jack.
- Don't be so guilty. I kept you uninvolved.

885
01:04:56,840 --> 01:05:00,196
The guy who's responsible is gone.
He's back in New Orleans.

886
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,635
It's pure evil, Jack.

887
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:06,429
A man kills for money.
He doesn't even know his victims.

888
01:05:06,520 --> 01:05:10,069
He kills, you pay him
and then he... he kills again.

889
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,594
What was your alternative?

890
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:15,069
How did I get in so deep? I...

891
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,914
What dream was I following?

892
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,437
Judah, you said it yourself a million
times. You only go around once.

893
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,200
Jack, I went to her place after.

894
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,750
I had to retrieve
some incriminating things.

895
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,072
I saw her there... just staring up.

896
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,151
An inert object.

897
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,596
There was nothing behind her eyes
if you looked into them.

898
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:44,274
All you saw was a

899
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,351
black void.

900
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,355
Can I help you?

901
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:27,594
I used to live in this house once.

902
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,671
Really? When?

903
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,551
Many years ago.

904
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:37,311
My brother and l
used to race through these rooms.

905
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:42,751
He was a wonderful kid, my brother.
We were very close in those days.

906
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:50,430
My father had high hopes for him,
but it never seemed to... work out for him.

907
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,070
Would you mind if I just take a minute?

908
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,311
Everything seems to be
flooding through me.

909
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,391
Sure.

910
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,074
Come on, Sol. Get on with it. I'm hungry.

911
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:27,151
- Do you mind, May?
- It's nonsense anyway.

912
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:30,391
Why put us through this mumbo jumbo?
Bring on the main course.

913
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,074
I apologise for my disrespectful sister.

914
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,470
This is the twentieth century.
You have young boys sitting here.

915
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,917
- Don't fill their heads with superstition.
- The intellectual. The schoolteacher.

916
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,639
Spare us your Leninist philosophy
just this once.

917
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:46,439
Afraid if you don't obey the rules
God'll punish you?

918
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,717
- Not me, May. He punishes the wicked.
- Who? Like Hitler?

919
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:52,598
- We're having a Seder!
- Six million Jews burned to death

920
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,592
- and they got away with it.
- How did they get away with it?

921
01:07:55,680 --> 01:07:59,229
Come on, Sol, open your eyes!
Six million Jews and millions of others.

922
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,880
- And they got off.
- How could humans do such a thing?

923
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:03,951
Because might makes right.

924
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,350
- Until the Americans marched in...
- I don't like this talk at my Seder.

925
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:09,556
OK, OK! All right!

926
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,631
I think this is interesting.

927
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,432
You know, there's this joke about
the prizefighter who enters the ring.

928
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,910
And his brother says to the family priest
"Father, pray for him."

929
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,833
The priest said "l will.
But if he can punch, it'll help."

930
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,311
What are you saying, May? You challenge
the whole moral structure of everything?

931
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:32,439
What moral structure? Is that the kind
of nonsense you use on your pupils?

932
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:35,910
Do you not find human impulses
basically decent?

933
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,709
- There's basically nothing.
- Such a cynic, my sister. A nihilist.

934
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:42,030
- Back to Russia!
- Well... Listen.

935
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:45,999
I happen to agree with May
when it comes to all that mumbo jumbo.

936
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:50,153
How can you say that? You come
to every Seder. You pray in Hebrew.

937
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:54,119
Yes. I'm going through the motions.
It's like any ritual. It's a habit.

938
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,034
What are you saying, May? There's
no morality anywhere in the whole world?

939
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,839
For those who want morality,
there's morality.

940
01:09:00,920 --> 01:09:04,754
- Nothing's handed down in stone.
- Sol's kind of faith is a gift.

941
01:09:04,840 --> 01:09:07,832
It's like an ear for music,
or the talent to draw.

942
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:11,196
He believes. You can use logic
on him and he still believes.

943
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:13,077
Must everything be logical?

944
01:09:13,160 --> 01:09:15,720
And if a man commits a crime,

945
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,997
if he... if he kills...

946
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,635
- One way or another he will be punished.
- If he's caught, Sol.

947
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:28,350
If he's not, that which originates from a
black deed will blossom in a foul manner.

948
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:31,432
- You're relying too heavily on the Bible.
- No, no, no.

949
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:35,559
Whether it's the Old Testament
or Shakespeare, murder will out.

950
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:39,516
- Who said anything about murder?
- You did.

951
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,791
Did l?

952
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,714
And I say,
if he can do it and get away with it

953
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:50,519
and he chooses
not to be bothered by the ethics,

954
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:51,999
then he's home free.

955
01:09:52,080 --> 01:09:55,038
Remember,
history is written by the winners.

956
01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:00,399
If the Nazis had won, future generations
would see World War ll quite differently.

957
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:04,632
Your aunt is a brilliant woman, Judah,
but she's had a very unhappy life.

958
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:07,314
And if all your faith is wrong, Sol?

959
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,914
Just what if, huh? If?

960
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,992
I'll still have a better life
than all of those that doubt.

961
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:17,119
Wait a minute. Are you telling me
that you prefer God to the truth?

962
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,033
If necessary,
I will always choose God over truth.

963
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:22,509
I agree with him.

964
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,319
I say what goes around comes around.

965
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,513
- Are you OK?
- Yes.

966
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,433
- I was worried. It's late.
- I had some business.

967
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:36,954
- Mrs. Ames is waiting.
- Any messages?

968
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,873
Yeah. An odd one.
A Detective O'Donnell called.

969
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:42,076
He wanted to talk to you about something.

970
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:46,711
I tried to get him to tell me what,
but he said he only wants to talk with you.

971
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:51,398
~ He says "Murder", he says

972
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,914
~ Every time we kiss,
he says "Murder", he says

973
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,594
~ Keep it up like this
and then "Murder", he says

974
01:10:56,680 --> 01:10:58,989
~ In that impossible tone

975
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,228
~ Will bring on
nobody's murder but his own

976
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:07,954
That was not such a great movie,
but it was fun.

977
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:11,476
Yeah, I liked it. I think maybe
when l' m older, I wanna be an actress.

978
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,951
Don't be an actress. I want you to be
on the Supreme Court, or a doctor.

979
01:11:16,040 --> 01:11:18,554
You know, show business is dog-eat-dog.

980
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,430
It's worse than dog-eat-dog. It's dog
doesn't return other dog's phone calls.

981
01:11:23,520 --> 01:11:25,829
Which reminds me,
I should check my service.

982
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,480
Though I haven't had a message
in seven years.

983
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,755
I call up and I hear the girls giggling.

984
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:32,910
- How's Halley?
- She's great.

985
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,991
I'm gonna make my move there, I think.

986
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:39,312
But I have this ethical dilemma cos I'm
married. You shouldn't know about that.

987
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:42,278
Clifford Stern. Any messages?
Can you check, please?

988
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:44,669
My heart says one thing.
My head says another.

989
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:48,673
Very hard to get your heart and head
together in life. Let me teach you that.

990
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,432
Mine aren't even friendly.

991
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:52,511
Yes.

992
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,551
Really?

993
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:04,151
No.

994
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:08,151
OK, thank you.

995
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:13,031
What's wrong?

996
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,391
Professor Levy

997
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:19,869
committed suicide.

998
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,394
But we must always remember

999
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:26,472
that we, when we are born,

1000
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:33,309
we need a great deal of love
in order to persuade us to stay in life.

1001
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,516
Once we get that love

1002
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,158
it usually lasts us.

1003
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,800
But the universe is a pretty cold place.

1004
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,952
It's we who invest it with our feelings.

1005
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,233
And, under certain conditions,

1006
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:49,835
we feel that the thing
isn't worth it any more.

1007
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:54,118
I came as soon as I heard.
I thought you might not wanna be alone.

1008
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:56,350
God, it's been terrible. You know?

1009
01:12:56,440 --> 01:12:59,034
I called... The guy was not sick at all.

1010
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:02,476
And he left a note, a simple note:
"I've gone out the window."

1011
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,951
This is a major intellectual, and this is
his note. What the hell does that mean?

1012
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:10,271
This guy was a role model.
You'd think he'd leave a decent note.

1013
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:12,874
Did he have family or anything?

1014
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,191
No. They were all killed in the war.
That's what's so strange.

1015
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:19,272
He's seen the worst side of life.
He always was affirmative.

1016
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:22,591
Always said yes to life. Yes, yes.
Now today, he said no.

1017
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:26,070
Can you imagine his students?
How shattered they're gonna be?

1018
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:28,993
I don't know from suicide.
Where I grew up in Brooklyn,

1019
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,833
nobody committed suicide.
Everyone was too unhappy.

1020
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,309
Boy, this will put a damper on the show.

1021
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:38,632
I got 600,000 feet of film on this guy
and he's telling how great life is,

1022
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,711
and now what am I gonna do?

1023
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,155
I'll cut it up and make it into guitar picks.

1024
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:48,792
I was thinking. No matter how elaborate
a philosophical system you work out,

1025
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:51,792
in the end, it's gotta be incomplete.

1026
01:13:52,480 --> 01:13:56,109
I've been so annoyed all day.
I'm sorry for seeming cranky.

1027
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:58,191
- I understand.
- This was such a blow.

1028
01:13:58,280 --> 01:14:00,953
I just thought
you might want some company.

1029
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:05,910
No, don't do that.

1030
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,231
It's something that
I've wanted to do now for weeks.

1031
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,470
- You must know that.
- You're married.

1032
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:15,189
Yes, I'm married,
but that's not gonna... last.

1033
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:19,034
- I mean, you know...
- Well, you know, I'm... I'm not ready.

1034
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:24,069
Is there something you're not telling me?

1035
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,310
- No.
- Is there anybody else?

1036
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,188
- I just don't want you to say it's Lester.
- It's me. It's just me.

1037
01:14:30,280 --> 01:14:34,910
I... I guess I haven't
gotten over my divorce yet.

1038
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:38,436
And also, I feel unsettled about my career.

1039
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:40,909
You don't know this
but I'm very ambitious,

1040
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:44,310
and that's an area
that I'd like to get consolidated.

1041
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,994
I just feel, you know, unsettled.

1042
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,872
- Don't confuse me.
- I'm not trying to confuse you.

1043
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,951
I don't know what I'm doing.

1044
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:09,957
I better go. I should just leave.

1045
01:15:10,040 --> 01:15:13,157
- You just got here.
- I know, but l... you know.

1046
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,552
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...
- No, that's OK. It's not... I'll see you soon.

1047
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,835
I'll just... I'll be seeing you.

1048
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:25,551
Please come in.

1049
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:29,990
We read about it in the paper.
It's a terrible thing.

1050
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:32,990
She'd been coming here for years.

1051
01:15:33,080 --> 01:15:35,071
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

1052
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,631
Just a couple of questions, Doctor.

1053
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:42,919
The record shows that she phoned you
here and at your home a number of times.

1054
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:44,877
She was worried about her eyes.

1055
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:48,669
- What was she suffering from?
- Nothing serious. She...

1056
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,874
She had light flashes
and they alarmed her.

1057
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,428
I could never find
anything very wrong with her.

1058
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,273
And I told her that
it's just a common occurrence.

1059
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:00,477
- She was a hypochondriac?
- No, I wouldn't say that but

1060
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,551
she was concerned.

1061
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,069
And there's nothing she ever said
that might be relevant to the case?

1062
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:09,151
Personal life? Friends?

1063
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:11,231
No. Not really.

1064
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,031
How did she come to you?

1065
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:17,515
You know, I honestly can't remember.

1066
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,512
- Possibly another patient.
- Can I get that name?

1067
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:23,876
Well, it was a while ago
and l... I treat so many patients.

1068
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:26,155
Might it be in your records?

1069
01:16:26,240 --> 01:16:29,232
No. No, l... I doubt it very much.

1070
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:33,672
- Well, I'm sorry to take up your time.
- That's all right.

1071
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:37,070
If you remember anything,
will you give me a call?

1072
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:38,434
Sure.

1073
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,511
- Thank you.
- Pleasure.

1074
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,075
Judah, you're having a breakdown.

1075
01:16:52,160 --> 01:16:55,311
The police know she phoned me.
I lied, but they saw through it.

1076
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,915
- I can't take this, Jack.
- Pull yourself together or you'll blow it.

1077
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,117
I did it, and it's irrevocable,
and now I'm gonna pay.

1078
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:05,875
I had to fight an urge to confess
to the police. I want this off my mind.

1079
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:10,511
Listen. I'm in this with you. I helped you
out and I don't wanna go to jail for it.

1080
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:16,835
You may not care if you drag me down
with you, but I'm not letting that happen.

1081
01:17:16,920 --> 01:17:20,708
- What the hell is that? A threat?
- Just be a man. You're in the clear.

1082
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,109
- You'll rub me out, too?
- Don't talk nonsense.

1083
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:25,760
What did you mean by saying
you won't let it happen?

1084
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:28,559
You're my brother.
You've helped me out financially.

1085
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:30,710
I did you a favour when you needed it.

1086
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,791
Now all of a sudden you want to confess?

1087
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:36,350
The time to confess was to Miriam,
about your mistress. Not about this.

1088
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:41,150
This is murder. You paid for it,
I engineered it. It's over. Forget about it.

1089
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,191
One sin leads to a deeper sin.

1090
01:17:44,280 --> 01:17:49,035
- Now you sound like Papa.
- Adultery, fornication, lies, killing.

1091
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,351
- Shut up already.
- Or you'll have your friends shut me up?

1092
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:55,273
One phone call,
like pushing a button, right?

1093
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:34,911
Judah, I don't know what's wrong with
you these days. You're a different person.

1094
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,991
I believe in God, Miriam.

1095
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:42,636
I know it... because without God
the world is a cesspool.

1096
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:47,475
You're drinking steadily and every day.
You never used to. It's something new.

1097
01:18:47,560 --> 01:18:49,949
- God, it's hot in here.
- Well, maybe we should go.

1098
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:54,238
- Don't tell me what I should do, dammit!
- Judah, will you calm down!

1099
01:18:56,680 --> 01:18:59,433
I don't feel well. I'm gonna get a little air.

1100
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:01,511
No, you stay here.

1101
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,228
Look, this story on the homeless,
it's too long.

1102
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:29,676
I want five pages. Make sure
he gets five real pages out of it.

1103
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:33,275
He tells the secretary to type it tighter.
He doesn't take anything out.

1104
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,157
I want Joe Hanson off the show.

1105
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:40,633
He doesn't write funny. If he has cancer,
I'll send him flowers. I want him off.

1106
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:44,235
Jesus! Doesn't anybody
know how to write funny any more?

1107
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,279
Am I supposed to write it myself?
Direct it myself? Produce it myself?

1108
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:52,717
I can 't believe this! Look at those people
out there! Look out the window at them.

1109
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:56,031
These people are lookin '
for something funny in their lives!

1110
01:19:56,120 --> 01:20:00,272
You're givin' 'em straight lines!
They're waitin' for something funny!

1111
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,031
This is terrible.

1112
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:22,111
What are you doing to me?

1113
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,919
This is supposed to be
the profile of a creative mind.

1114
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:30,115
It's tough for a woman in this profession.
I can make it easier for you.

1115
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,158
What is this? When did you shoot that?

1116
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:36,437
I was lurking around the corner.
I couldn't resist.

1117
01:20:36,520 --> 01:20:41,594
I don't wanna do it in kind of a vulgar way
and just take it off what I see here.

1118
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,831
I wanna find out what's in here,
so I gotta spend some time with you.

1119
01:20:44,920 --> 01:20:48,435
We 'll have a little dinner together, just...

1120
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,909
OK, step aside. I' m taking over this film.

1121
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:54,470
- What? You can't finish my film.
- I can't? Read your contract.

1122
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,916
- You promised.
- Look, the idea was to show the real me.

1123
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,835
I may not be perfect, but I don't promote
values that... Let me quote you exactly:

1124
01:21:02,920 --> 01:21:05,957
"that deaden the sensibilities
of a great democracy".

1125
01:21:06,040 --> 01:21:08,759
You're fired, Cliff!
You're out! Get outta here!

1126
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:11,195
Go! Thank you! Goodbye!

1127
01:21:11,280 --> 01:21:15,478
If it bends, it's funny. If it breaks, it isn't.

1128
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:20,074
Come on now. Don't get discouraged.
You have your own personal vision.

1129
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:24,199
Why is he so upset? You'd think nobody
was ever compared to Mussolini before.

1130
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:29,308
I had no idea you would cut the film like
this. I'd have told you they'd never use it.

1131
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:31,789
They want an upbeat profile of Lester.

1132
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,475
Now he's gonna re-cut it
and make himself into a saint.

1133
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:39,792
Wendy's right. I'm probably jealous
of him. His limos, his money, his women.

1134
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:41,871
You have your own style.

1135
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:46,112
Hey, listen. Marry me. I'm serious.
That's the only thing that'll satisfy me.

1136
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,351
I'm crazy about you. You're single.
My marriage won't last.

1137
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:53,194
I gotta talk to you. Can we just...
Can we sit down here for a second?

1138
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,352
I'm not joking. I'm really nuts about you.

1139
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,431
I'm going away.

1140
01:22:00,480 --> 01:22:02,471
Yeah? Meaning what?

1141
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:07,831
I've... I'm... I've got a chance
to produce a couple of shows in London

1142
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:09,911
and I couldn't say no.

1143
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:13,871
So how long are you going for?

1144
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:16,599
Well, probably three or four months.

1145
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:18,671
Three or four months?

1146
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,391
Jesus, you're kidding.

1147
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,471
What a discouraging thought.

1148
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:28,473
But, you know,
I think it's a good thing, because I ne...

1149
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:31,074
Well, it'll give me a little distance.

1150
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:33,720
About 3,000 miles, to be exact.

1151
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:37,270
- When are you leaving?
- I guess... ten days or so.

1152
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,991
God, I'm...

1153
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,279
God, I'm gonna miss you.
I don't know what to say. I just...

1154
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:52,912
I'm not gonna see you
for three or four months?

1155
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,834
I feel like l... you know,
like I've been handed a prison sentence.

1156
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,876
Ben, your daughter
will make a beautiful bride.

1157
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:33,797
This is Barbara,
the sister of my brother-in-law.

1158
01:23:34,640 --> 01:23:38,679
Congratulations.
I wish your daughter all the happiness.

1159
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:45,711
Jesus. I'm so self-conscious.

1160
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:47,950
Every single thing on me is rented.

1161
01:23:48,040 --> 01:23:51,476
I got a rented tux,
rented shoes, rented underwear.

1162
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,790
You look terrific. Cliff, do me a favour.

1163
01:23:53,880 --> 01:23:57,759
This is your last occasion with my family.
Could we try to get along?

1164
01:23:58,160 --> 01:24:00,390
And this is Dr Rosenthal.

1165
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:02,471
I'm Miriam.

1166
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:07,111
- And this is Marion, and this is Peter.
- How do you do? A pleasure to meet you.

1167
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,430
- Judah?
- Yes, Ben.

1168
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,557
Judah, I'm so glad you could make it.
It means a lot.

1169
01:24:15,480 --> 01:24:18,756
What is the matter with you?
You seem so depressed.

1170
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:21,593
Wendy and I finally decided
to call it quits.

1171
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:26,754
Even though the last couple of years have
been terrible, it just makes me feel sad.

1172
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:29,673
- I'll have a vodka and tonic.
- I'll have one, too.

1173
01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,116
But, you know, you told me
it's been platonic for a year.

1174
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:35,589
And I say once the sex goes, it all goes.

1175
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:40,435
It's true. Last time I was inside a woman
was when I visited the Statue of Liberty.

1176
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:52,435
Look at your father.
He's celebrating enough for two.

1177
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:56,115
He and Ben will get high
and argue about belief and God.

1178
01:24:56,200 --> 01:24:58,350
My father takes after his Aunt May.

1179
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:03,798
She rejected the Bible because she said
it had an unbelievable central character.

1180
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:08,158
I walked in. I said "The Waldorf-Astoria.
The centrepieces." Did you see them?

1181
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,550
- Beautiful.
- Everything matches. Lester paid for it.

1182
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,279
Hard to believe
a brother would pay for a wedding.

1183
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,433
Hard to believe, but that's the sort of thing
Lester is always doing. Isn't it?

1184
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:20,715
He must be a good brother.

1185
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:39,188
I'm gonna get one like that.
It's much better. This is very square.

1186
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:41,510
- Hi, Cliff.
- Cliff. Hello.

1187
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:44,239
Lester. How are you? Good to see you.

1188
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:48,632
- My fiancee, Halley Reed.
- Congratulations. My wife Nancy.

1189
01:25:52,040 --> 01:25:54,952
- When'd you get back?
- Got back this morning.

1190
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,794
- I've been trying to call you all day.
- I finally won her heart.

1191
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,511
What a romantic story.
We ran into each other in London

1192
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:07,435
and I sent her white roses
around the clock, all the time, for days.

1193
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,114
For days. And then
I found out she was allergic.

1194
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,636
- Hi, Lester.
- Hi. Good to see you.

1195
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:18,999
So, I started pleading with her. I begged
her. I just... begged her day and night.

1196
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,913
And I think it was the caviar that did it.

1197
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,753
I tell you, I've envied this guy for years.

1198
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:29,231
He'd show up with a beautiful woman
every time. But I envy you more now.

1199
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:31,038
Thank you.

1200
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,709
Standing here in the presence of God,

1201
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,831
the guardian of our homes,

1202
01:27:00,920 --> 01:27:03,354
ready to enter into the bonds of wedlock,

1203
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,989
answer each of you in reverence for God

1204
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:12,154
and in the hearing of the assembly that
have gathered here so joyously with you.

1205
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:22,755
- I know the perfect guy for you.
- Who?

1206
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,799
- He's brilliant. He's attractive.
- There's a hitch. I'm waiting.

1207
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:30,634
There's a hitch, but it sounds
worse than it is. He's in prison.

1208
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:34,713
- Rita, I would say that's a drawback.
- Nothing terrible. Insider trading.

1209
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,076
He made a fortune in the market.
And he'll be out soon.

1210
01:27:38,160 --> 01:27:40,515
Very soon. A couple of years.

1211
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:42,591
You mean with good behaviour.

1212
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,671
Cliff?

1213
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,671
I wanted to talk to you.

1214
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:12,232
What is there really to say?
You know, I'm just stunned still.

1215
01:28:15,720 --> 01:28:18,109
He's not what you think.

1216
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,990
He's wonderful. He's...
He's warm and caring and...

1217
01:28:24,040 --> 01:28:26,713
- romantic...
- He's a success. That's what he is.

1218
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:30,156
- He's rich and he's a success.
- Give me a little credit.

1219
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,789
I always did give you
a little credit, until today.

1220
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:38,829
We used to laugh at this guy. The silly
shows he puts on, the way he talks.

1221
01:28:38,920 --> 01:28:40,911
He's endearing.

1222
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,759
This is my worst fear realised.

1223
01:28:50,520 --> 01:28:53,512
I wanted to give you this letter back.

1224
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:59,353
- It's my one love letter.
- It's beautiful.

1225
01:28:59,440 --> 01:29:01,829
I'm just... the wrong person.

1226
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:07,791
It's probably just as well.

1227
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:12,239
I plagiarised most of it from James Joyce.

1228
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,833
You probably wondered
why all the references to Dublin.

1229
01:29:16,920 --> 01:29:18,717
Look, l...

1230
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:21,719
I hope we can always be friends.

1231
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,838
Off by yourself, huh? You're like me.

1232
01:30:09,400 --> 01:30:12,153
I always get sad at these kind of events.

1233
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,231
You look very deep in thought.

1234
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:19,309
I was plotting the perfect murder.

1235
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,471
Yeah? Movie plot?

1236
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:26,235
Movie?

1237
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,676
Ben... That's what Ben told me.
He says you make films.

1238
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:32,675
Yeah, but not that kind... You know.

1239
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:34,751
A different kind.

1240
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:38,111
I have a great murder story.

1241
01:30:39,720 --> 01:30:41,711
- Yes?
- Great plot.

1242
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,991
Yeah.

1243
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:49,789
Hey, I've had too many to drink.
I mean, forgive me.

1244
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:51,871
I know you want your privacy.

1245
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:55,589
No, it's OK. You know.
I'm not doing anything special.

1246
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:59,593
Except my murder story has

1247
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:01,671
a very strange twist.

1248
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:05,591
Yeah?

1249
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,593
Let's say there's this man
who's very successful.

1250
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,955
He has everything.

1251
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,476
- Let me ask you something.
- What?

1252
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:23,073
Am I a phoney?

1253
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:24,479
- What?
- Am I a phoney?

1254
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,678
- Are you a little high or something?
- No, I'm... I think he hates me.

1255
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,830
- Who hates you?
- Your annoying husband.

1256
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:33,150
Every time I'm with him, I get tense.

1257
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:35,834
- It's just that he's angry.
- At what?

1258
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:40,357
Are you kidding me? He's got these
fantasies about changing the world.

1259
01:31:40,440 --> 01:31:42,829
He makes these films
and they come to nothing.

1260
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:47,436
Listen, honey. He's gotta grow up.
This is the real world. This is the big time.

1261
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,751
They don't pay off on high aspirations.
You gotta deliver.

1262
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:56,551
Not to mention... You're still young.
You're not gettin' the life that you deserve.

1263
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:58,631
Lester, I met somebody.

1264
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:01,271
That...

1265
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:04,156
That is music to my ears.

1266
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:08,394
And after the awful deed is done,

1267
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,790
he finds that he's plagued
by deep-rooted guilt.

1268
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:17,000
Little sparks of his religious background,
which he'd rejected,

1269
01:32:17,080 --> 01:32:19,071
are suddenly stirred up.

1270
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,591
He... hears his father's voice.

1271
01:32:22,680 --> 01:32:26,673
He... imagines that God
is watching his every move.

1272
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:32,828
Suddenly it's not an empty universe at all,
but a just and moral one, and...

1273
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,711
he's violated it.

1274
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:38,669
Now he's panic-stricken.

1275
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,433
He's on the verge of a mental collapse.

1276
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:45,513
An inch away from confessing
the whole thing to the police.

1277
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:52,118
And then, one morning, he awakens and

1278
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,829
the sun is shining and
his family is around him and

1279
01:32:55,920 --> 01:32:59,435
mysteriously the crisis has lifted.

1280
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:06,031
He takes his family on a vacation to
Europe and as the months pass he finds

1281
01:33:06,120 --> 01:33:08,111
he's not punished.

1282
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:10,191
In fact, he prospers.

1283
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:15,117
The killing gets attributed to a drifter who
has several other murders to his credit

1284
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:18,317
so, what the hell,
one more doesn't even matter.

1285
01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:21,874
Now he's scot-free.

1286
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:24,554
His life is completely back to normal.

1287
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:29,399
Back to his protected world
of wealth and privilege.

1288
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,393
Yes, but can he ever really go back?

1289
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,559
Well... People carry sins
around with them.

1290
01:33:39,640 --> 01:33:43,599
Maybe once in a while
he has a bad moment, but it passes.

1291
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,755
And, with time, it all fades.

1292
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:53,233
Yeah, but... so then, you know,
his worst beliefs are realised.

1293
01:33:53,960 --> 01:33:56,997
Well, I said it was a chilling story, didn't l?

1294
01:33:58,840 --> 01:34:02,435
I don't know. It'd be tough
for somebody to live with that.

1295
01:34:02,520 --> 01:34:06,752
Very few guys could actually
live with that on their conscience.

1296
01:34:06,840 --> 01:34:09,195
People carry awful deeds
around with them.

1297
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:12,590
What do you expect him to do?
Turn himself in?

1298
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,671
I mean, this is reality.

1299
01:34:14,760 --> 01:34:19,515
In reality, we rationalise, we deny,
or we couldn't go on living.

1300
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,633
Here's what I would do.
I would have him turn himself in.

1301
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:30,190
Cos then, you see, your story
assumes tragic proportions

1302
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,635
because, in the absence of a God,

1303
01:34:32,720 --> 01:34:35,678
he is forced to assume
that responsibility himself.

1304
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:37,751
Then you have tragedy.

1305
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:41,039
But that's fiction. That's movies.

1306
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,115
You see too many movies.
I'm talkin' about reality.

1307
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:49,992
I mean, if you want a happy ending,
you should go see a Hollywood movie.

1308
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:54,954
Come on, darling.
Let's think about going home, huh?

1309
01:34:55,040 --> 01:34:57,156
Nice talkin' to you. Good luck.

1310
01:34:57,240 --> 01:35:01,791
Miriam, we're gonna make a wedding
like this for Sharon. And I can't wait.

1311
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,871
She'll be radiant.

1312
01:35:04,280 --> 01:35:08,398
- You're looking very handsome tonight.
- And you look beautiful.

1313
01:35:31,120 --> 01:35:36,990
We are all faced throughout
our lives with agonising decisions.

1314
01:35:37,080 --> 01:35:39,071
Moral choices.

1315
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,038
Some are on a grand scale.

1316
01:35:42,120 --> 01:35:45,556
Most of these choices
are on lesser points.

1317
01:35:46,200 --> 01:35:51,433
But we define ourselves
by the choices we have made.

1318
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:56,432
We are, in fact,
the sum total of our choices.

1319
01:35:57,200 --> 01:36:00,476
Events unfold so unpredictably,

1320
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:03,070
so unfairly.

1321
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:07,199
Human happiness does not
seem to have been included

1322
01:36:07,280 --> 01:36:09,669
in the design of creation.

1323
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:14,231
It is only we, with our capacity to love,

1324
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:18,029
that give meaning
to the indifferent universe.

1325
01:36:18,120 --> 01:36:25,117
And yet, most human beings seem
to have the ability to keep trying,

1326
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:27,750
and even to find joy,

1327
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:29,831
from simple things,

1328
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:32,354
like their family,

1329
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:34,317
their work,

1330
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:41,397
and from the hope that future
generations might understand more.
