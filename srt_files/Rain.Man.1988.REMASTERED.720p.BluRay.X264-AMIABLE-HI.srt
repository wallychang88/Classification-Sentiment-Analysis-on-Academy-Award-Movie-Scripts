those roses, they're all dying.

I knew this car my whole
life. Only drove it once.

171
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:03,185
It's a 1949 Buick
Roadmaster convertible.

172
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:07,356
Only 8,000 production models
made. Straight-8. Fireball-8.

173
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:11,161
It was the first full year of
the Dynaflow transmission.

174
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,871
I know it by rote.

175
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,130
SUSANNA: You were his only child.

176
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:36,732
You came along when he was,
what, 45 or something?

177
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:39,596
Probably thought he was
never going to have a son.

178
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,944
So he had to love you.

179
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,392
I think you're exaggerating.

180
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:46,895
You were his child,
his son, his blood.

181
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,064
Anyway, in these pictures here,
he doesn't look like a man

182
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,024
- who doesn't love his child.
- What are you doing looking at this?

183
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,067
- Put that away.
- No.

184
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,322

wanna hear a story?

185
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,737
- I'll tell you one story.
- But don't get mad.

186
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,915
I'm just saying. You know the
convertible in the garage? His baby.

187
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:00,868
- That and the goddamn roses.
- Buick.

188
00:11:00,869 --> 00:11:03,829
The car was off-limits to me.
"That's a classic," he'd say.

189
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,873
"It commands respect.
It's not for children."

190
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:08,208
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years
old, and for once,

and it's almost all A's.

192
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,673
I go to my old man,
"Can I take the car out?"

193
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,217
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.

194
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,844
He says no.

195
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,138
I take it anyway. I steal
the keys, I sneak it out.

- Yes.
- Why? Why then?

198
00:11:25,143 --> 00:11:28,020

enough for this guy.

00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,300
Well, he can jump out.

336
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,468
I'm an excellent driver.

337
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,862
That's good. Come on, come on.

338
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:02,349
Why did you let him get in
this car? It's not a toy.

339
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,392
He says he... He says
he drives this car.

340
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,645
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway every Saturday.

341
00:19:06,646 --> 00:19:11,608
Course, the seats were originally brown
leather, now they're pitiful red.

342
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,377
You know, these seats
were brown leather.

343
00:19:15,196 --> 00:19:16,237
You know this car?

344
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,506
I know this car.

345
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:22,118
How do you know this car?

346
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,412
Definitely know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.

347
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:28,667
Straight-S, Fireball-8.
Only 8,095 production models.

348
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,252
Dad lets me drive slow on the
driveway, but not on Monday.

349
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,379
Definitely not on Monday.

350
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,673
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.

351
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,757
Sanford Babbitt?

352
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:39,528
10961 Beechcrest Street,
Cincinnati, Ohio.

353
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,888
That's my address.
What is it with this guy?

354
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,473
Hey, who's your mother?

355
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,599
Eleanor Babbitt.

356
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,725
Eleanor?

357
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:48,311
Died January 5, 1965, after
a short and sudden illness.

358
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:49,437
Who the hell are you?

359
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:50,605
- Uh-oh.
- Huh?

360
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,023
Wait a second, where are you going?

361
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,442
Thirteen minutes to Judge
Wapner and <i>The People's Court.</i>

362
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:56,569
Hold it, wait a second here,
I want to ask you a question.

363
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,364
(MUTTERING) "What you are witnessing
is real. The participants are not..."

364
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,667
Hey, I'm talking to you!

365
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,120
Bruner, who is this guy?

366
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,663
Raymond is your brother.

367
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:08,456
RAYMOND: "...have their dispute
settled here in our forum,

368
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,541
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

369
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:12,210
My brother? I don't have a brother.

370
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,004
"...court cases, and have their
dispute settled here in our forum,

371
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:16,131
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

372
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:17,933
(IMITATING THEME SONG)

373
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,260
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

374
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,654
<i>"The People's Court."</i>

375
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,775
MALE ANNOUNCER: The People's Court.

376
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:29,436
<i>Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,</i>

377
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,980
<i>and welcome to</i> The People's Court.

378
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,815
- CHARLIE: What, is he crazy?
- BRUNER: No.

379
00:20:33,816 --> 00:20:35,483
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.

380
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,318
Well, he's not crazy, he's
not retarded, but he's here.

381
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,237
He's an autistic savant.

382
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,697
I don't know what that means.

383
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:43,199
Some people like him used
to be called idiot savants.

384
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,161
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.

385
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,495
Yeah, but he's retarded.

386
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,998
Autistic. Actually,
high-functioning.

387
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:51,875
What does that mean?

388
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,169
It means that there's a disability

389
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,338
that impairs the sensory input
and how it's processed.

390
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,674
English here. You're
talking over my head.

391
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:02,135
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.

392
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:03,386
He can't even express himself,

393
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,472
or probably even

394
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:08,492
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.

395
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,479
<i>MAN ON TELEVISION:
...and after that, the dog bit him.</i>

396
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,981
<i>I yelled at my dog,
the dog laid down...</i>

397
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,025
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.

398
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:20,111
Routines, rituals, it's all
he has to protect himself.

399
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,614
Rituals. That's a good one.

400
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,450
It's the way he acts,

401
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,035
sleeps, eats,

402
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,788
uses the bathroom, walks,
talks, everything.

403
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,457
Any break from the routines,
and it's terrifying.

404
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,833
How long has he been here?

405
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,376
Well, let's see.
I came here in 1960.

406
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,128
No, how old is he?

407
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,756
He was 18 or 20 then. I'd
have to check the records...

408
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,342
- You've been here that long?
- That's when I actually started.

409
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:45,303
So that's '65, '75, '85.

410
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,222
I was almost three years old
and you knew he had a brother,

411
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,808
you knew I was his brother.

412
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,184
Yes, but what's the point?

413
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:53,186
What's the point? What's
the fuckin' point is

414
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:55,313
why didn't anybody tell
me I had a brother?

415
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,412
What would you have done about it?

416
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,539
I don't know.

417
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,198
Does he know how much
money he's been left?

418
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,878
No, he doesn't understand
the concept of money.

419
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:12,080
He doesn't understand
the concept of money.

420
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,457
He's just inherited $3 million,

421
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,377
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?

422
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:20,463
(CHUCKLING) That is fucking poetic,

423
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,937
don't you think?

424
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,052
Good old Dad.

425
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,762
RAYMOND: ...name's yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.

426
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,514
I mean the fellow's name
on first base. Who.

427
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:31,599
The fellow playing first
base for St. Louis. Who.

428
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,352
- What are you asking me for?
- What is this? Why is he doing that?

429
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,396
(MUTTERING) Whenever he gets
nervous, he does "Who's on First?"

430
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:38,940
- You know, from Abbott and Costello.
- Yeah. Why?

431
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,527
Why? It's his way of dealing with you
touching things, his books and stuff.

432
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:44,612
So he memorized "Who's on First?"

433
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,281
Yeah, that among other things.

434
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,157
Raymond, Ted Klus-zesski.

435
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,617
- Kluszewski.
- SUSANNA: Kluszewski.

436
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,287
Kluszewski, Ted Kluszewski,
Big Klew, first base.

437
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:53,621
He played for Cincinnati?

438
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,957
Course, he was traded
for Dee Fondy, 1957.

439
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:59,127
- Lifetime batting average .298.
- All these great books. He reads, huh?

440
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,005
VERN: Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.

441
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:03,673
(EXCLAIMING ANXIOUSLY)

442
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,967
Oh, Vern. V-E-R-N!

443
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,636
Course, these people are
gonna be here all day, Vern.

444
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,847
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

445
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,850
This is definitely not
a weekend visit, Vern.

446
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:17,450
- He's getting anxious. It's okay, Ray!
- Oh, Vern!

447
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,565
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.

448
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:22,400
Put it back. He said not
to touch the books.

449
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:23,651
Not to touch books.

450
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,778
- You like Shakespeare, Ray?
- I don't know.

451
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,405
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know.

452
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,656
- You don't know?
- Vern.

453
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,991
- Did you read <i>Macbeth</i>?
- I don't know. Vern.

454
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,826
- You read <i>Hamlet</i>?
- I don't know. Vern!

455
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,536
- Read the <i>Twelfth Night</i>?
- Stop it!

456
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,621
- (QUIETLY) Yes.
- Yes?

457
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,705
Yes.

458
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:38,333
You read all these stories
that are in this book,

459
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:39,792
and you don't know if
you read the book?

460
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,002
I don't know. V-E-R-N.

461
00:23:41,003 --> 00:23:42,045
You don't know?

462
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,689
Maybe you better put it back.

463
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:49,232
You don't know, okay. No, Ray,
take it easy, I'm not going to...

464
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:51,554
I won't touch anything else, Ray.

465
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,765
It's okay, Ray. It's okay. Come on.

466
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:54,974
My main man.

467
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,976
Yeah, Vern, my main man.

468
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,311
My main man, Vern.

469
00:23:58,312 --> 00:24:00,659
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.

470
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,191
- My main man.
- Yeah, my main man.

471
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:04,567
Here.

472
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:05,693
Here are your cards.

473
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,904
I'm sorry, I didn't know where
you want me to put them.

474
00:24:07,905 --> 00:24:10,907
(STAMMERING) Are you taking
any prescription medication?

475
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:13,506
(VERN LAUGHING)

476
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,329
He likes you. That's just
his way of showing it.

477
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,747
Uh-oh.

478
00:24:17,748 --> 00:24:19,874
When I touched him
before, he pulled away.

479
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,542
Don't take it personal.

480
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,919
He never touched me.

481
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,629
I'm closer to him than
anybody in the world.

482
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,714
Known him for nine years.

483
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,216
It's not in him.

484
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,884
If I left town tomorrow
and didn't say goodbye...

485
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,928
- Uh-oh.
- ...he'd never notice.

486
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:33,888
SUSANNA:
He wouldn't notice if you left?

487
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:37,693
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.

488
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,603
Hey, Ray, you want
to go take a walk?

489
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,701
Hmm? Ray?

490
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:45,024
Ray?

491
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:48,069
Can he hear us when he's like that?

492
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:50,154
Hey, man. You wanna show
your brother your ducks?

493
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,549
Course, it's 27
minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

494
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:55,952
Don't worry, Ray, we'll
bring you right back.

495
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:58,329
Practically 26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

496
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,622
We'll bring him right back.

497
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,332
RAYMOND: 26 minutes to <i>Jeopardy!</i>

498
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,750
SUSANNA: I won't do it.

499
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,793
I can't do it.

500
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:08,506
First of all because of your tone
of voice, this commanding...

501
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,757
You're upset. Just calm down.

502
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,092
And second thing is because
you didn't tell me why.

503
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,469
- Raymond, I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.
- Bye, Raymond.

504
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:16,931
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.

505
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,599
No. Just stay.

506
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,226
Just stay there.

507
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:22,770
No, Raymond. Raymond.
Raymond. Raymond!

508
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:27,608
Just stay there. Just stand
still, okay? That's good.

509
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,413
Okay, I'll do it if you tell
me why. Why do I do, uh...

510
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,448
What?

511
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:36,117
Why do I have to take the
car and go down there

512
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,910
and wait for you again at the gate?

513
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,662
- I've been waiting for you for days.
- No.

514
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,956
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.

515
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,929
The car disturbs him.

516
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,803
- That's why?
- That's why.

517
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,672
Okay, Raymond.

I don't know.

522
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,359
Listen, our father died.

523
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,403
Did you know that he died last
week, did they tell you that?

524
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,613
I don't know.

525
00:26:13,614 --> 00:26:17,634
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?

526
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:22,163
That means he's gone. He's not with
us anymore. He's at the cemetery.

527
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:23,664
You want to go see him
at the cemetery, Ray?

528

I don't know.

529
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,001

that mean maybe you wanna go?

Angeles, like to see a Dodger game.

533
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:39,680
Go see the Dodgers play.

534

Today's an off day.

535
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:41,891
We don't have to go today.

536
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,142
Monday. No games scheduled.

537
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,144
Just thought maybe you'd like
to go to Los Angeles with me,

538
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:47,605
you know, go see Fernando
Valenzuela pitch.

539
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,608
Fernando Valenzuela pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch till Wednesday.

540
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,194
- He's gonna pitch on Wednesday?
- Wednesday.

541
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,904
I'm not doing anything
on Wednesday.

542
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,030
Yeah, Wednesday.

543
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:57,832

- Yeah.

Come on, Ray.

545
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,497
Course, it's a long
way to California.

546
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:08,084
I'm definitely not supposed to be off
the grounds for more than two hours.

547

my tapioca pudding.

and I don't have my tapioca pudding,

567

- Should be near the window.

00:34:31,133 --> 00:34:32,628
- What were you doing in my room?
- I don't know.

669
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:34,530
You don't know what you
were doing in my room.

670
00:34:34,531 --> 00:34:36,609
- Course, there were noises.
- There were noises.

671
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,411
Well, those noises are none of your
business, you understand that? Huh?

672
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,038
Put the phone book down, stop acting
like an idiot, and go to sleep.

673
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,332
CHARLIE: (YELLING) Hey, did you
hear what I said? Go to sleep!

674
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:46,500
Go to sleep!

675
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,586
Course, it's nine minutes to
11:00. Lights out at 11:00.

676
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,730
Yeah, well, new rules.

677
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,145
You don't listen to me.
You don't listen to me.

678
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:07,479
What? What are you talking about?

679
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,358
I asked you to go there and apologize.
You went there and insulted him again!

680
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,527
What am I supposed to do,
tuck him in? I'm not his mother.

681
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:17,221
Charlie, you're his brother. His brother!
They tell you today for the first time

682
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,235
that you have a brother, and
I don't see in your face

683

- Take it easy. Take it easy.

684

I'm not saying joy,
I'm saying something.

685
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,788
Take it easy, you don't know
what I'm going through here.

686
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,873
No, I don't know what
you're going through.

687
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,942
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.

688
00:35:27,943 --> 00:35:29,960
Because you don't tell me anything.

689
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:33,756
- You just give me lies, lies, lies.
- Lies, lies? What lies?

690
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:37,092
The thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.

691
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,304
I know it's not true. So why don't
you tell me, why is he here?

692
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:41,388
'Cause I'm pissed at him.

693
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:42,973
- At who?
- At my father.

694
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,392
You're pissed at your father,
and you bring Raymond here why?

695
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,353
I don't know why. 'Cause I
got him and they want him.

696
00:35:47,354 --> 00:35:49,429
- This makes no sense!
- Raymond was left all the money,

697
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:51,099
- and I got nothing.
- How much?

698
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,442
$3 million. The inheritance,
every penny of it.

699
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:55,499
- So?
- So I'm gonna keep him till I get my half!

700
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,313
I deserve that!

702
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,537
- Just take it easy here.
- I've had enough.

703
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,748
What? You've had enough? What does
that mean, you've had enough?

704
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:08,957
I've just had enough, I'm leaving.

705
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,250
- You're leaving?
- Yes.

706
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,877
You're leaving me now? I need you.

707
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,380
- I need you now.
- What? You need nobody.

708
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,090
What does that mean?

709
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,885
What? Just take it easy.
What is my crime here?

710
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:22,846
- What is my goddamn crime?
- Your crime is that you use people!

711
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,099
You're using Raymond!
You're using me!

712
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,266
You use everybody.

I'm using Raymond? Raymond!

00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,229
Raymond, am I using you?
Am I using you, Raymond?

715
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:31,313
- Yeah.
- Shut up!

He is answering a question
from a half-hour ago!

717
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,275
What good is $3 million to him?

718
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,028
That money is only just gonna sit
there for the rest of his life.

719
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,822
And I need that money, you
know I need that money!

720
00:36:39,823 --> 00:36:42,199
Yeah, you need them, so it's
hardly like stealing, no?

721
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,076
And when it's over, what
happens to Raymond?

722
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,828
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or a better place.

723
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:48,288
(STAMMERING) With the money,
I will put him in a better place.

724
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,374
What difference does it make?
He is gonna be just the same!

725
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,834
Only you have his money, yeah!

726
00:36:51,835 --> 00:36:53,669
His money? That man
was my father, too.

727
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,046
What about my fuckin' half?
Where's my fuckin' half?

728
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,297
I'm entitled to that money!

729
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,674
You've kidnapped this man!

730
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:00,217
- I did not take him.
- Yes, you did.

731
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,136
I did not take him, I took my half.

732
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:03,512
Which half? You're crazy!

733
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:04,847
Yeah, it runs in the family.

734
00:37:04,848 --> 00:37:07,391
You're wet, soaking wet and you're gonna
leave in the middle of the night.

Would you just... Just wait!

736
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:11,895
My father has stuck
it to me all my life.

737
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,605
- What do you want from me?
- I want out.

738
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,578
Out.

00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:09,842
I think this autism
is a bunch of shit!

1157
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:12,929
'Cause you can't tell me
you're not in there somewhere!

1158
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,181
Boxer shorts.

1159
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:17,859
Boxer shorts at Kmart.

1160
00:57:18,018 --> 00:57:21,062
These are... These are Hanes 32.

1161
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:23,397
- You're driving me crazy.
- Mine are boxer shorts.

1162
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,067
We're gonna have to make a little
stop and find a psychiatrist.

1163
00:57:26,068 --> 00:57:27,526
You're driving me crazy.

1164
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,362
Oak and Burnett, that's
where the shorts are.

1165
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:30,613
'Cause you are driving me crazy.

1166
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,198
We have to buy them at
Kmart, Oak and Burnett.

1167
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,951
We have to buy them
back in... Uh-oh.

1168
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,370
Course, your shorts
are on the highway.

1169
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:40,344
Let's go back to Cincinnati. Kmart.

1170
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,538
Good luck trying to find
a shrink in this town.

1171
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,150
Raymond?

1172
00:59:16,011 --> 00:59:18,188
(HONKING)

1173
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,350
(HORNS BLARING)

1174
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:26,312
Hey, you. Hey, dipshit, move it!

1175
00:59:26,313 --> 00:59:28,831
(HONKING CONTINUES)

1176
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,525
If you ain't gonna
move, I'll move you.

1177
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,486
Hey, buddy. Hey, you!

1178
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:35,821
- You're gonna get run over out here.
- Hey! Hey!

1179
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:37,782
- You're gonna get hurt. Come on.
- It said, "Don't walk."

1180
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:40,451
- Hey! Do you hear me?
- Yeah. It said, "Don't walk."

1181
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,619
Move it. Move it.

1182
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:43,954
Hey, it's all right, sir.

1183
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:45,998
I'm sorry. He's from
out of town. Raymond?

1184
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:47,666
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1185
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,002
- It's all right.
- Gotta get to Kmart.

1186
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:52,505
Raymond, Raymond, come on.

1187
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:54,173
Kmart, 400 Oak Street.

1188
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,508
It said, "Don't walk."

1189
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:56,592
Yes, it's broken.

1190
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:58,394
It said, "Don't walk."

1191
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,222
- This way.
- Have to get to Kmart.

1192
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,474
400 Oak and Burnett.

1193
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:05,276
Oak and Burnett.

1194
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,814
He said, "Young man, go west,"

1195
01:00:09,815 --> 01:00:12,191
and this is the way
our country developed

1196
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,027
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.

1197
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:21,050
During that period of
time there was initiated

1198
01:00:21,993 --> 01:00:24,912
what was known as the Pony Express.

1199
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,872
I'm sure all of you have
read something about it

1200
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,666
in the history of
the United States.

1201
01:00:28,667 --> 01:00:31,502
I may not have the days
exactly right or the years,

1202
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:36,399
but I'm more or less familiar with
the history of the United States.

1203
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,176
He's "artistic"?

1204
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,053
No, he's autistic.

1205
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:43,389
I'm not familiar with that.

1206
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:45,641
What is the exact
nature of the problem?

1207
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,059
(CAMERA CLICKS)

1208
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,862
He lives in a world of his own.

1209
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:54,024
I'm sorry, but what's
wrong with him?

1210
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:56,277
It was a problem gettin'
mail from the East Coast...

1211
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,529
Raymond, do a little of your
"What's On First?" for her.

1212
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,531
Who's on first. What's on second.

1213
01:01:00,532 --> 01:01:02,333
Huh?

1214
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:07,121
They set up an initial program

1215
01:01:07,122 --> 01:01:09,248
where the Pony Express

1216
01:01:09,249 --> 01:01:13,428
would ride for
approximately 20 miles...

1217
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:16,422
What am I supposed to do?

1218
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,225
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.

1219
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:20,926
DOCTOR: I'm not a psychiatrist,

1220
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:23,762
but I do know that his brain
doesn't work like other people.

1221
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,931
What he does isn't
intended to be annoying.

1222
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:29,059
If he's getting on your nerves,
you just take a break.

1223
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:30,227
Spend time away from him.

1224
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,937
Sure, I'll just send him back.

1225
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,063
- Sorry?
- Nothing,

1226
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,732
just kidding, it's an inside joke.

1227
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,859
You're telling me I just have to
deal with this stuff, is that it?

1228
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,445
I just gotta deal with this stuff.

1229
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:41,793
Yeah, that's about it.

1230
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,169
Out of curiosity, does he
have any special abilities?

1231
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,079
Well, he's got a
pretty good memory.

1232
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,373
He counts toothpicks.

1233
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,918
He spilled a box of
toothpicks on the floor.

1234
01:01:53,919 --> 01:01:56,545
He took one look at them and he
knew exactly how many there were.

1235
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,689
He counted them in seconds.

1236
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,007
Ray?

1237
01:02:00,008 --> 01:02:01,467
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

1238
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:03,344
Are you good with numbers?

1239
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,803
Yeah.

1240
01:02:04,804 --> 01:02:07,223
I read about this. I want
to try something here.

1241
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:08,557
Kmart. 400 Oak Street.

1242
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,726
What did I tell you? After
this, Raymond. After this.

1243
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,312
- Ray, can we try something?
- Yeah.

1244
01:02:13,313 --> 01:02:19,443
Do you know how much
312 times 123 is?

1245
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,862
38,376.

1246
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,239
He's right.

1247
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,823
- What?
- He's right.

1248
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,950
- He's right?
- Yeah.

1249
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:30,287
Ray, how much is 4,343

1250
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,540
times 1,234?

1251
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:35,793
5,359,262.

1252
01:02:35,794 --> 01:02:38,096
- He's a genius.
- That's right.

1253
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:39,588
He's a genius.

1254
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:45,520
Ray, do you know how much the
square root of 2,130 is?

1255
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:50,182
46.15192304.

1256
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,475
2304.

1257
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:52,935
That's amazing.

1258
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:56,865
That is amazing. He should work
for NASA or something like that.

1259
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,360
If you had a dollar, and
you spent 50 cents,

1260
01:03:01,361 --> 01:03:03,913
how much money would you have left?

1261
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,993
About 70.

1262
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,577
- 70 cents?
- 70 cents.

1263
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:12,037
So much for the NASA idea.

1264
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,081
Kmart. We should go to Kmart.

1265
01:03:14,082 --> 01:03:15,374
What'd I tell ya? After this, Ray.

1266
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,293
400 Oak Street.

1267
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:20,222
Ray, do you know how
much a candy bar costs?

1268
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,672
About $100.

1269
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,173
- $100, huh?
- Yeah.

1270
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:25,342
Do you know how much one of
those new compact cars cost?

1271
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,520
About $100.

1272
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:32,057
In his particular case, he's pretty
well-off, he's very high-functioning.

1273
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:35,987
Most autistics, they can't speak
or they can't communicate.

1274
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:38,439
- Ray?
- Yeah.

1275
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,858
- Do you know what autistic is?
- Yeah.

1276
01:03:40,859 --> 01:03:43,252
- You know that word?
- Yeah.

1277
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,831
Are you autistic?

1278
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,168
I don't think so.

1279
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:54,180
No, definitely not.

1280
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,293
<i>LENNY: ...problem with the
Lamborghinis, Charlie.</i>

1281
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:01,378
CHARLIE: Just shut up a second.
Let me see if I understood this.

1282
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,463
RAYMOND: Very small. Yeah.

1283
01:04:02,464 --> 01:04:04,757
It's gonna cost me $10,000
additional for each car.

1284
01:04:04,758 --> 01:04:06,258
- Course, it's very crowded in here.
- Is that...

1285
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:09,094
- It's very crowded in here.
- Ray, please, just one second, okay?

1286
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,763
Huh? What?

1287
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:13,057
They wanna take out the
manifold and the carburetors

1288
01:04:13,058 --> 01:04:15,184
in order to put in a fuel
injection system now?

1289
01:04:15,185 --> 01:04:16,560
I mean, that is nonsense.

1290
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:17,936
<i>- I know that you're upset.</i>
- What are you doing?

1291
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,606
- Too crowded in here for a backpack.
- Just leave this on.

1292
01:04:20,607 --> 01:04:23,776
Yeah. It's gonna cost me
$40,000 just to meet EPA now.

1293
01:04:23,777 --> 01:04:25,778
What? No. No. No.

1294
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:29,698
You give me the number. I'm gonna
call the conversion shop myself.

1295
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:31,575
That's my pen. That's
definitely my book.

1296
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,786
Taking your book is
not a serious injury.

1297
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:36,080
For serious injury, look at the
red book. That book is blue.

1298
01:04:36,081 --> 01:04:39,166
Forgive me. I've lost my
secret decoder ring. 4-5-4-5.

1299
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,794
- You're already number 18. In 1988.
- Got it. 1988, I know.

1300
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:43,796
It's my book. That's my pen.

1301
01:04:43,797 --> 01:04:45,923
Uh-oh. 12 minutes to Wapner.

1302
01:04:45,924 --> 01:04:47,800
It's definitely very small in here.

1303
01:04:47,801 --> 01:04:50,219
Small... and safe.

1304
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,345
You don't wanna miss the party.

1305
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:52,554
What you're witnessing is real.

1306
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:55,198
Do you know that? There's a
party in your honor, Ray.

1307
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:58,769
When we get to L.A., a custody hearing.
My lawyer's setting it up right now.

1308
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:01,647
You know why there's a party for you?
Because you're the 3-million-dollar man.

1309
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:03,065
What you are witnessing is real.

1310
01:05:03,066 --> 01:05:04,149
Ken Aldorf.

1311
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:05,651
- The participants are not actors.
- Charlie Babbitt.

1312
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:06,985
Uh-oh. Fart.

1313
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:08,404
Yeah, Charlie Babbitt. I'll hold.

1314
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:09,655
Uh-oh. Fart.

1315
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,365
- Did you fart, Raymond?
- Fart.

1316
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:13,383
- Did you fuckin' fart?
- Fart.

1317
01:05:13,451 --> 01:05:16,299
Oh, man. Get the smell out.

1318
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,747
- How can you stand that?
- I don't mind it.

1319
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,124
How can you stand that?

1320
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,834
- Yeah, Ken.
- Ten minutes to Wapner.

1321
01:05:21,835 --> 01:05:23,627
Ken? How are you?
This is Charlie Babbitt.

1322
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:25,254
We're definitely locked
in this box with no TV.

1323
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,464
I just heard about this
$10,000 charge for every car.

1324
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,384
- They're definitely gonna start...
- How can this be?

1325
01:05:30,385 --> 01:05:33,011
- How can this possibly happen right now?
<i>- The People's Court</i> starts...

1326
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,805
- I don't know.
- You're telling me another $40,000.

1327
01:05:34,806 --> 01:05:37,558
They start on the button. They
definitely start on the button.

1328
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:40,310
I've got a problem. I'm gonna have
to call you back from my next stop.

1329
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:43,272
- We're not gonna make it to the program.
- Okay, my next stop.

1330
01:05:43,273 --> 01:05:45,357
- Definitely have to go now.
- Yes, we're going, Ray.

1331
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,152
- Just take it easy. Just take it easy.
- Eight minutes to Wapner.

1332
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,529
Where am I gonna find a
television around here?

1333
01:05:50,530 --> 01:05:53,833
- Eight minutes to Wapner.
- We got eight minutes to Wapner.

1334
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,184
CHARLIE: Come on. Come on.

1335
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:16,763
You wanna get in there and see
the show? Huh? Huh, Raymond?

1336
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,724
Wanna get in there and see
the show? Then listen up.

1337
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,369
There's not another farmhouse
in sight. This is it, man.

1338
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,648
You act weird, we don't get in.
You listening to me?

1339
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:27,858
Yeah.

1340
01:06:27,859 --> 01:06:30,986
I want you to look normal. As
normal as possible, all right?

1341
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,739
Just put your hands down.
Don't rock and moan.

1342
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,033
- Four minutes to Wapner.
- Just shut up and stand there.

1343
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:37,868
Yeah. Uh...

1344
01:06:37,869 --> 01:06:41,548
Raymond, don't rock and moan.
Put your hands down.

1345
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:47,769
Good afternoon, ma'am. I'm Donald
Clemons from the A.C. Nielsen Company.

1346
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,755
You're familiar with our work?

1347
01:06:49,756 --> 01:06:51,965
Nielsen... I... You
mean the TV ratings?

1348
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:54,760
Yes, ma'am. That's exactly it. You've
been selected as a preliminary candidate

1349
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:58,096
to become our next Nielsen
family in the tri-county area.

1350
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,619
- My husband's not home.
- If selected...

1351
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,985
you'll share the responsibility for
shaping television programming

1352
01:07:02,986 --> 01:07:04,845
viewed by our entire nation

1353
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:09,775
in return for which you'll receive a
check in the amount of $286 each month.

1354
01:07:09,776 --> 01:07:11,235
- (HUMMING)
- Who's he?

1355
01:07:11,236 --> 01:07:16,758
That would be my partner,
Mr. Bainbridge, who does sample...

1356
01:07:19,619 --> 01:07:21,245
- Oh, boy.
- CHARLIE: That's it.

1357
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,664
You blew it. You don't
get to see your program.

1358
01:07:23,665 --> 01:07:25,290
- It's finished.
- One minute to Wapner.

1359
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,001
CHARLIE: One minute to Wapner. One
minute to Wapner. One minute to Wapner.

1360
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:30,045
I had you in there, Ray!
You were in there.

1361
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:31,296
(HUMMING)

1362
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,632
Defendants! Plaintiffs!
You had it all!

1363
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:36,176
- Uh-oh.
- They're in there making legal history, Ray.

1364
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,470
- Legal history.
- Oh! Oh, boy!

1365
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,638
Oh, boy.

1366
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,056
What is going on out here?

1367
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,766
- I'm sorry, ma'am. I lied to you.
- It's gonna be on.

1368
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,477
I am very sorry about that. That
man right there is my brother.

1369
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,896
If he doesn't watch <i>People's
Court</i> in about 30 seconds

1370
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,648
he's gonna throw a fit
right here on your porch.

1371
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:52,918
Now, you can help me, or you can
stand there and watch it happen.

1372
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,126
We like to watch cartoons.
You think he'd settle for that?

1373
01:07:57,824 --> 01:08:00,626
<i>MAN ON TV:
...and she sees an identical twin.</i>

01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:13,171

- Daddy's not here now.

1379
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:17,092
<i>I wanted to take it off quickly
because it got very cold.</i>

1380
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,178
<i>I also confess, I was afraid
I might burn my hand.</i>

1381

1382
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,392

me, I'm gonna take care of you.

- Yes, sir.

1397
01:09:19,873 --> 01:09:21,098
Must be some accounting error.

1398
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,241
- How much is this gonna cost?
- $20, sir.

Course, I'm never going back.
It's gonna be a long time.

1406
01:10:09,997 --> 01:10:12,290
It's definitely going
to be a long journey.

1407
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,875
Just a couple of more days, Ray.

1408
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,628
Yeah... You know the fella's name?
Then who's playing first?

1409
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,714
You mean the fellow playing
first base for St. Louis?

1410
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:20,716
We're gonna start with this again,
Ray? It's just another motel.

1411
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,759
You gotta do this every time?

1412
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,970
That's the man's name.
That's whose name?

1413
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,597
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.

1414
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:29,057
Who's on first.

1415
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:30,726
I'm asking you who's on first.

1416
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:32,352
Yo, Ray.

1417
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:34,646
Ray, this is not...
It's not a riddle.

1418
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:37,498
Yeah. You know the fellow's name?
Then who's playing first?

1419
01:10:37,499 --> 01:10:41,528
You're never gonna figure out who's on
first base, because Who is on first base.

1420
01:10:41,529 --> 01:10:43,196
That's a joke, Ray. It's comedy.

1421
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,782
Sometimes his wife comes down
and collects it. Whose wife?

1422
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:48,631
- It's comedy, man.
- Every dollar of it.

1423
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,787
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.

1424
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:52,497
It's a routine between
Abbott and Costello.

1425
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:53,957
When you do it, you're not funny.

1426
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:56,501
You're the comedy team
of Abbott and Abbott.

1427
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:57,836
You understand what I'm saying?

1428
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,337
Sometimes his wife comes
down and collects it.

1429
01:10:59,338 --> 01:11:00,714
Whose wife? Yeah.

1430
01:11:00,715 --> 01:11:04,885
Ray, you are never
going to solve it.

1431
01:11:04,886 --> 01:11:08,180
You know why you're never gonna
solve it? 'Cause it's not a riddle, man.

1432
01:11:08,181 --> 01:11:11,683
If you understood that, if you
understood that it's funny,

1433
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,101
you might get better.

1434
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,438
All I'm trying to find out is,
what's the guy's name on first base?

1435
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,106
What's the guy's
name on first base?

1436
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,858
No. What's the guy's
name on second base.

1437
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:22,110
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

1438
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,538
Then who's playing first? Yeah.

1439
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,365
Who's... You know the
fellow's name? Yeah.

1440
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:28,617
Then who's playing first?

1441
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:30,994
The fella playing for St. Louis?

1442
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,662
Who. The guy on first.

1443
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:34,206
The first baseman. Who's on first.

1444
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,832
What are you asking me for?

1445
01:11:35,833 --> 01:11:37,876
Have you got a first
baseman on first? Yeah.

1446
01:11:37,877 --> 01:11:39,377
All right, Ray. Come on.

1447
01:11:39,378 --> 01:11:42,297
We're gonna put the bed by
the window the way you like.

1448
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,840
We got your apple juice.

1449
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:48,011
We're gonna take the pens and paper out,
we're gonna put 'em on the table...

1450
01:11:48,012 --> 01:11:49,221
What's the matter, Ray,
did I forget something?

1451
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,347
Cheese balls.

1452
01:11:50,348 --> 01:11:53,308
- Yes, I forgot the cheese balls.
- Definitely have cheese balls.

1453
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,518
But we got them.

1454
01:11:54,519 --> 01:11:56,686
I have to have 12 cheese balls.

1455
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:58,104
I have to get my tartar
control toothpaste.

1456
01:11:58,105 --> 01:12:00,232
We got that. I got that for
you a couple of days ago.

1457
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,501
Where's my tartar
control toothpaste?

1458
01:12:03,736 --> 01:12:05,788
Raymond.

1459
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,366
Raymond, remember when that doctor
asked you those questions today?

1460
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,493
- The number questions?
- Yeah.

1461
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,036
How did you do that?

1462
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:14,579
- I see it.
- Huh?

1463
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:16,206
I see it.

1464
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:17,374
What's that?

1465
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:20,168
- Will you stop that for a second?
- I see it.

1466
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:21,503
Just put that down, will you?

1467
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:22,754
I'm trying to talk to you.

1468
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:24,673
When I say stop it, why
don't you stop it?

1469
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:27,568
Why do you always have
to act like an idiot?

1470
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,428
- You think that's funny?
- Yeah.

1471
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,430
Funny Rain Man. Funny teeth.

1472
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:33,598
What did you say?

1473
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,867
- Funny teeth.
- Rinse.

1474
01:12:41,023 --> 01:12:43,075
Why did you say...

1475
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,609
Why did you say funny teeth?

1476
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:47,412
You said funny teeth,
funny Rain Man.

1477
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:49,781
Rain Man? I said Rain Man?

1478
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:52,084
Yeah, funny Rain Man.

1479
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,747
Was I trying to say Raymond,
and it came out Rain Man?

1816
01:36:06,886 --> 01:36:09,179
He's my brother.
I'm living in his room.

1817
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:10,722
He seems young to be your brother.

1818
01:36:10,723 --> 01:36:13,558
He was born August 12, 1962.

1819
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:15,576
It was a Sunday.

Whoa. Look, I'm out of here.

- It's 10:00!
- Course, I have to be in bed at 11:00.

You like her, Ray?
You think she's pretty?

1836
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:57,394
Yeah. She's very sparkly.

1837
01:36:57,395 --> 01:37:01,039
- Definitely very sparkly.
- Very sparkly.

1838

He did a great job on that suit.

1839

- It's not Kmart.

- I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
- Yeah.

1845
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:20,055
- Kmart sucks. Okay?
- Yeah.

1846

That's a bed. That's your bed.

1855
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,353
I had them put it up there
especially for you,

1856
01:37:39,354 --> 01:37:40,687
right by the window, just
the way you like it.

1857

Very sparkly. Very twinkly.

We made a lot of money!

Forgetting the $3,000 that we tossed
away at that wheel of fortune.

1866
01:38:06,964 --> 01:38:09,257
Yeah, wheel of fortune.

1867
01:38:09,258 --> 01:38:10,634
I'm sorry about that.

1868
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:12,886
I'm sorry, you know, I got
a little carried away.

1869
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:16,315
- I got a little hot, okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

1870
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:21,195
I'm saying that I'm sorry, and I just
want you to know that I am sorry.

1871

You don't know how to dance?
You ought to learn sometime.

gonna have to dance on this date.

1893
01:39:10,528 --> 01:39:12,237
Have to go to the date.
Learn to dance.

01:52:44,591 --> 01:52:46,342
And no strings attached.

2153
01:52:46,343 --> 01:52:48,565
You just walk away, Charlie.

2154
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:51,472
You know, this isn't
about you and me.

2155
01:52:51,473 --> 01:52:53,866
It's not about winning or losing.

2156
01:52:55,978 --> 01:52:59,814
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?

2157
01:52:59,815 --> 01:53:01,832
You didn't have an answer.

2158
01:53:02,901 --> 01:53:04,827
I don't know.

2159
01:53:06,363 --> 01:53:07,697
It's funny, I just realized

2160
01:53:07,698 --> 01:53:11,342
I'm not pissed off anymore my
father cut me out of his will.

2161
01:53:12,703 --> 01:53:14,287
You were his friend, you
probably knew he tried

2162
01:53:14,288 --> 01:53:17,164
to contact me a few
times over the years.

2163
01:53:17,165 --> 01:53:19,125
I never called him back.
I was a prick.

2164
01:53:19,126 --> 01:53:21,043
If he was my son,
didn't return my calls,

2165
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:22,878
I'd have written him out. Fuck him.

2166
01:53:22,879 --> 01:53:25,602
But it's not about
the money anymore.

2167
01:53:26,842 --> 01:53:30,094
It's about... I just
don't understand

2168
01:53:30,095 --> 01:53:31,762
why didn't he tell
me I had a brother?

2169
01:53:31,763 --> 01:53:33,055
Why didn't you tell
me I had a brother?

2170
01:53:33,056 --> 01:53:37,201
Why didn't anyone ever tell
me that I had a brother?

2171
01:53:38,228 --> 01:53:40,154
I mean...

2172
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:45,035
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.

01:56:17,429 --> 01:56:19,346
- Pancakes.

Hello?

2202
01:57:24,120 --> 01:57:25,955
This is not a legal
proceeding, Mr. Babbitt,

2203
01:57:25,956 --> 01:57:27,873
so there's no lawyers,
no judge present,

2204

just the people who
care about Raymond.

Raymond, why don't you
have a seat over there?

2206
01:57:32,754 --> 01:57:34,505
Mr. Babbitt, why don't you go
to that side of the table?

2207
01:57:34,506 --> 01:57:36,298
Raymond, right here. Have a seat.

2208
01:57:36,299 --> 01:57:38,759
Raymond, right here.
Take this seat, okay?

2209
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,553
Ray, you can put your
knapsack on the floor.

2210
01:57:40,554 --> 01:57:43,305
I think this is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.

- Yeah.

- On the floor. I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

2213
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:51,564
I don't know any easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt...

2214
01:57:51,565 --> 01:57:52,773
To say what?

2215
01:57:52,774 --> 01:57:55,317
- Have I lost already?
- No, you haven't lost.

2216
01:57:55,318 --> 01:57:58,737
I'm not the judge and jury. I'm just a
doctor making a recommendation to a court.

2217
01:57:58,738 --> 01:58:00,030
Now, I must tell you
that Dr. Bruner

2218
01:58:00,031 --> 01:58:02,199
is a very respected professional.

2219
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:05,077
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years,

2220
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:08,330
and, of course, Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions we have in this country.

2221
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:10,624
Boy, you guys have already made
up your mind. I'll see you in court.

2222
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:11,667
Hold on, son. No one's your enemy.

2223
01:58:11,668 --> 01:58:13,335
My brother came further
with me in a week

2224
01:58:13,336 --> 01:58:15,170
than he did with you in 20 years.
And that's the truth.

2225
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:17,172
- I don't think...
- You don't know anything about us!

2226
01:58:17,173 --> 01:58:19,258
I don't think it's necessary
to challenge Dr. Bruner.

2227
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:20,759
- I'm sorry.
- All right.

2228
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,803
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?

2229
01:58:22,804 --> 01:58:25,681
- Well, we got...
- I was asking Raymond.

2230
01:58:25,682 --> 01:58:28,655
Raymond, what happened
this past week?

2231
01:58:29,019 --> 01:58:31,020
- What did you do, Raymond?
- Counted cards.

2232
01:58:31,021 --> 01:58:33,105
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.

2233
01:58:33,106 --> 01:58:34,648
Your brother took you to Las Vegas?

2234
01:58:34,649 --> 01:58:37,192
$3,000 on the wheel of fortune.

2235
01:58:37,193 --> 01:58:39,194
He gave you $3,000 to gamble with?

2236
01:58:39,195 --> 01:58:42,448
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.

2237
01:58:42,449 --> 01:58:44,783
- What else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.

2238
01:58:44,784 --> 01:58:46,327
What else did you do?

2239
01:58:46,328 --> 01:58:47,953
Danced with Charlie Babbitt.

2240
01:58:47,954 --> 01:58:49,955
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn how to dance

2241
01:58:49,956 --> 01:58:51,790
- so I taught him.
- Danced in the elevator with Susanna.

2242
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:53,042
Kissed Susanna.

2243
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:55,252
- Kissed Susanna?
- Yeah. In the elevator.

2244
01:58:55,253 --> 01:58:57,129
Did you enjoy kissing a woman?

2245
01:58:57,130 --> 01:58:58,380
I don't know.

2246
01:58:58,381 --> 01:58:59,548
How did it feel?

2247
01:58:59,549 --> 01:59:00,758
It felt wet.

2248
01:59:00,759 --> 01:59:02,384
- Wet?
- Yeah.

2249
01:59:02,385 --> 01:59:04,653
- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.

2250
01:59:05,639 --> 01:59:06,889
You enjoy being on the road?

2251
01:59:06,890 --> 01:59:08,265
I'm an excellent driver.

2252
01:59:08,266 --> 01:59:10,392
- You drove?
- Yeah.

2253
01:59:10,393 --> 01:59:12,728
Your brother let you drive on
the highway? The interstate?

2254
01:59:12,729 --> 01:59:13,979
Yeah, slow on the driveway.

2255
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:16,532
He didn't drive on the highway.

2256
01:59:17,901 --> 01:59:19,568
Did he have any emotional
outbursts this past week?

2257
01:59:19,569 --> 01:59:20,653
What do you mean?

2258
01:59:20,654 --> 01:59:22,529
Well, things they tend to do.

2259
01:59:22,530 --> 01:59:24,573
Inflicting bodily
harm on themselves...

2260
01:59:24,574 --> 01:59:27,076
- Okay, yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?

2261
01:59:27,077 --> 01:59:29,662
Okay, he had what you call
an outburst at the airport

2262
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:32,247
because he didn't want to
fly, so we didn't fly.

2263
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:33,874
When was the last
outburst that he had?

2264
01:59:33,875 --> 01:59:36,335
- This morning.
- This morning?

2265
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:39,797
This is bullshit. Because I could tell
you anything, I could tell you nothing,

2266
01:59:39,798 --> 01:59:41,173
and you'd never know
the difference.

2267
01:59:41,174 --> 01:59:43,300
This morning the smoke
alarm went off.

2268
01:59:43,301 --> 01:59:45,094
He got a little
nervous, but he's fine.

2269
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:47,971
Don't feel as though
I'm placing any blame.

2270
01:59:47,972 --> 01:59:49,306
We went out for pancakes.

2271
01:59:49,307 --> 01:59:52,267
- Look at him, he's fine.
- You don't have to be defensive.

2272
01:59:52,268 --> 01:59:53,811
- I'm not challenging you.
- I'm just being honest with you.

2273
01:59:53,812 --> 01:59:55,354
- You're missing the point.
- You're missing the point.

2274
01:59:55,355 --> 01:59:56,730
I'm being truthful about this.

2275
01:59:56,731 --> 01:59:59,525
The point I was trying to make
is I'm not placing any blame...

2276
01:59:59,526 --> 02:00:01,819
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all,

2277
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:03,612
I find out a few days ago
that I have a brother,

2278
02:00:03,613 --> 02:00:05,614
and I wanna be with him and
I'm supposed to give him up?

2279
02:00:05,615 --> 02:00:07,366
No one is saying anything...

2280
02:00:07,367 --> 02:00:09,493
I didn't hurt him,
he's not hurting me,

2281
02:00:09,494 --> 02:00:12,371
we're not hurting you. Now, why are
you interfering? This is my family.

2282
02:00:12,372 --> 02:00:13,694
- I'm not interfering.
- This is my family.

2283
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:15,541
- Do you understand that?
- I understand that.

2284
02:00:15,542 --> 02:00:16,667
Yes, you do have a brother,

2285
02:00:16,668 --> 02:00:19,962
but the point is he's not capable
of having a relationship with you.

2286
02:00:19,963 --> 02:00:23,006
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?

2287
02:00:23,007 --> 02:00:24,299
Have you ever done that?

2288
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,051
Look, you cannot take
on the responsibility

2289
02:00:26,052 --> 02:00:27,386
of your brother without
professional guidance.

2290
02:00:27,387 --> 02:00:30,347
- That's your opinion, Dr. Bruner.
- Yes, it's my opinion.

2291
02:00:30,348 --> 02:00:32,224
There's a couple of things I'd
like to go over in this file.

2292
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:36,103
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution

2293
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:38,939
and you're willing to trade him for
$1.5 million. Is that correct?

2294
02:00:38,940 --> 02:00:40,983
My father died. I was upset.

2295
02:00:40,984 --> 02:00:42,609
- Okay? That was wrong.
- Okay.

2296
02:00:42,610 --> 02:00:43,986
So last week you were upset,

2297
02:00:43,987 --> 02:00:46,447
and then this week you suddenly
found some devotion to your brother

2298
02:00:46,448 --> 02:00:48,699
and you want to take care of
him the rest of your life?

2299
02:00:48,700 --> 02:00:50,752
Yes.

2300
02:00:50,994 --> 02:00:54,079
So in the beginning, it
was like a kidnapping.

2301
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:56,081
Kidnapping... That's very strong.

2302
02:00:56,082 --> 02:00:57,541
I didn't kidnap my brother.

2303
02:00:57,542 --> 02:01:00,878
But in the course of the week, you came
to have an understanding with him.

2304
02:01:00,879 --> 02:01:02,087
Yes.

2305
02:01:02,088 --> 02:01:03,797
Look, that...

2306
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,048
- Yes?
- When we...

2307
02:01:05,049 --> 02:01:07,468
I understand that this
sounds irrational to you.

2308
02:01:07,469 --> 02:01:09,720
Yes, when it started out, it had...

2309
02:01:09,721 --> 02:01:11,805
Don't feel compelled to
be defensive about that.

2310
02:01:11,806 --> 02:01:12,931
- Can I talk?
- Yes, you can.

2311
02:01:12,932 --> 02:01:15,601
- I'd like to talk. Thank you.
- Yes, you can.

2312
02:01:15,602 --> 02:01:17,060
There's no accusations.

2313
02:01:17,061 --> 02:01:18,353
Go ahead.

2314
02:01:18,354 --> 02:01:20,326
There's no accusations?

2315
02:01:21,608 --> 02:01:25,277
See, you have to understand that
when we started out together,

2316
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:28,155
that he was only my brother

2317
02:01:28,156 --> 02:01:30,173
in name.

2318
02:01:33,495 --> 02:01:35,672
And as...

2319
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:40,542
Then this morning we had pancakes.

2320
02:01:40,543 --> 02:01:41,585
Maple syrup.

2321
02:01:41,586 --> 02:01:43,086
Maple syrup on the...

2322
02:01:43,087 --> 02:01:45,172
- Maple syrup on the table.
- And pancakes.

2323
02:01:45,173 --> 02:01:48,021
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.

2324
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:51,191
You see, we...

2325
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:54,014
I made a connection.

2326
02:01:54,015 --> 02:01:55,766
I think that's very admirable
that you made a connection,

2327
02:01:55,767 --> 02:01:58,143
but I think the purpose of
this meeting is to determine

2328
02:01:58,144 --> 02:01:59,561
what is best for Raymond.

2329
02:01:59,562 --> 02:02:02,564
Whether or not he's capable of
functioning in the community,

2330
02:02:02,565 --> 02:02:03,982
and what, in fact, he wants,

2331
02:02:03,983 --> 02:02:06,109
if that's possible to determine.

2332
02:02:06,110 --> 02:02:07,361
I'm all for that.

2333
02:02:07,362 --> 02:02:09,780
Raymond's unable to make
those kind of decisions.

2334
02:02:09,781 --> 02:02:10,864
You're wrong.

2335
02:02:10,865 --> 02:02:12,699
BRUNER: Charlie, you know
he can't decide for himself.

2336
02:02:12,700 --> 02:02:15,077
He's capable of a lot
more than you know.

2337
02:02:15,078 --> 02:02:18,163
DOCTOR: Why don't we ask Raymond?
Maybe we can find a few answers.

2338
02:02:18,164 --> 02:02:21,262
Raymond, can I ask
you a few questions?

2339
02:02:21,417 --> 02:02:23,126
- Ray, the doctor's talking to you.
- Yeah?

2340
02:02:23,127 --> 02:02:25,725
- Raymond, can I ask you a few questions?
- Yeah.

2341
02:02:27,715 --> 02:02:30,563
Do you want to stay with
your brother Charlie?

2342
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:34,054
Raymond, would you like to stay with
your brother Charlie in Los Angeles?

2343
02:02:34,055 --> 02:02:36,682
CHARLIE: Ray, the doctor's
asking you a question,

2344
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:38,976
- so you listen, okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

2345
02:02:38,977 --> 02:02:42,405
Raymond, do you want to stay
with your brother Charlie?

2346
02:02:42,939 --> 02:02:44,236
Raymond, do you want to stay...

2347
02:02:44,237 --> 02:02:46,208
- with your brother Charlie?
- Yeah.

2348
02:02:46,234 --> 02:02:48,443
- You do?
- Yeah.

2349
02:02:48,444 --> 02:02:51,029
- You want to stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

2350
02:02:51,030 --> 02:02:53,115
Stay with my brother,
Charlie Babbitt.

2351
02:02:53,116 --> 02:02:55,509
- DOCTOR: That's what you want?
- Yeah.

2352
02:02:56,870 --> 02:03:00,093
- You want to stay with your brother?
- Yeah.

2353
02:03:02,792 --> 02:03:05,627
- Can I ask you something else, Raymond?
- Yeah.

2354
02:03:05,628 --> 02:03:08,146
- Do you want to go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

2355
02:03:08,798 --> 02:03:12,134
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?

2356
02:03:12,135 --> 02:03:13,982
Yeah.

2357
02:03:16,097 --> 02:03:17,764
Do you want to stay with
your brother Charlie

2358
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,808
- here in Los Angeles?
- Yeah.

2359
02:03:19,809 --> 02:03:22,577
- Or do you wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.

2360
02:03:22,979 --> 02:03:26,148
Two separate things, stay with your
brother or go back to Wallbrook?

2361
02:03:26,149 --> 02:03:27,816
It's not one thing, Raymond.

2362
02:03:27,817 --> 02:03:29,276
This is your brother.
You make a choice.

2363
02:03:29,277 --> 02:03:30,986
RAYMOND: Back to Wallbrook,
stay with Charlie Babbitt.

2364
02:03:30,987 --> 02:03:32,070
Okay.

2365
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,864
Back to Wallbrook, stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.

2366
02:03:33,865 --> 02:03:35,657
No, no, no. Two separate things.
Can you make that choice?

2367
02:03:35,658 --> 02:03:37,618
- One or the other.
- Yeah, go back to Wallbrook...

2368
02:03:37,619 --> 02:03:39,036
All right.

2369
02:03:39,037 --> 02:03:42,456
- Stay back at Wallbrook.
- CHARLIE: Hold on. Just hold on!

2370
02:03:42,457 --> 02:03:45,125
- Stay back at Wallbrook.
- All right.

2371
02:03:45,126 --> 02:03:48,503
You made your point. Okay?
You don't have to humiliate him.

2372
02:03:48,504 --> 02:03:51,673
Ray, it's okay. It's over.

2373
02:03:51,674 --> 02:03:53,050
Yeah.

2374
02:03:53,051 --> 02:03:55,945
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.

2375
02:03:56,179 --> 02:03:57,679
Stay back at Wallbrook.

2376
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,056
It's over.

2377
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:01,450
- Raymond?
- Yeah.

2378
02:04:04,270 --> 02:04:05,854
Dr. Bruner, can I talk
to you for a minute?

2379
02:04:05,855 --> 02:04:08,373
- Of course.
- Excuse me.

2380
02:04:16,157 --> 02:04:18,755
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.

2381
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:22,268
You don't want any more
questions, do you?

2382
02:04:22,269 --> 02:04:25,433
- No.
- No.

2383
02:04:26,209 --> 02:04:28,477
I don't know.

2384
02:04:33,424 --> 02:04:36,009
You don't want any more questions,
do you? No more questions.

2385
02:04:36,010 --> 02:04:37,811
No.

2386
02:04:40,932 --> 02:04:43,225
Don't worry. There's not gonna
be any more questions, okay?

2387
02:04:43,226 --> 02:04:44,303
- Yeah.
- No more questions.

2388
02:04:44,304 --> 02:04:47,925
- I'll make sure of that, okay, Ray?
- Yeah. Main man.

2389
02:04:48,398 --> 02:04:50,950
- What?
- My main man.

2390
02:04:55,238 --> 02:04:57,335
Listen...

2391
02:05:00,410 --> 02:05:03,804
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna have
a chance to talk to you again.

2392
02:05:07,083 --> 02:05:09,510
Because you see, these...

2393
02:05:09,711 --> 02:05:11,294
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,

2394
02:05:11,295 --> 02:05:14,923
and he's probably gonna want
to take you back with him.

2395
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:17,226
- You know?
- Yeah.

2396
02:05:18,636 --> 02:05:19,803
But I just want you to know

2397
02:05:19,804 --> 02:05:23,824
that what I said about being
on the road with you, I meant.

2398
02:05:23,933 --> 02:05:26,110
Connecting.

2399
02:05:26,978 --> 02:05:28,645
I like having you for my brother.

2400
02:05:28,646 --> 02:05:31,414
I'm an excellent driver.

2401
02:05:32,900 --> 02:05:34,997
Yes, you are.

2402
02:06:01,596 --> 02:06:04,273
I like having you
for my big brother.

2403
02:06:06,851 --> 02:06:08,652
Yeah.

2404
02:06:22,700 --> 02:06:25,468
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

2405
02:06:28,456 --> 02:06:31,600
C-H-A-R-L-I-E.

2406
02:06:32,168 --> 02:06:34,220
Main man.

2407
02:07:07,286 --> 02:07:09,287
<i>MAN ON PA:
May I have your attention, please?</i>

2408
02:07:09,288 --> 02:07:13,583
<i>Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound,</i>

2409
02:07:13,584 --> 02:07:16,461
<i>now boarding, track number three.</i>

2410
02:07:16,462 --> 02:07:17,671
<i>Fullerton, San Bernardino.</i> ..

2411
02:07:17,672 --> 02:07:19,297
Ray.

2412
02:07:19,298 --> 02:07:24,524
<i>...Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.</i>

2413
02:07:30,393 --> 02:07:32,936
- Hello, Charlie. Hello, Raymond.
- Dr. Bruner.

2414
02:07:32,937 --> 02:07:36,356
Wouldn't you feel a little more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?

2415
02:07:36,357 --> 02:07:38,066
- Tell him, Ray.
- Kmart sucks.

2416
02:07:38,067 --> 02:07:39,234
(CHUCKLES) I see.

2417
02:07:39,235 --> 02:07:43,738
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.

2418
02:07:43,739 --> 02:07:45,365
Why don't you take a
couple of minutes?

2419
02:07:45,366 --> 02:07:47,509
See you, Charlie.

2420
02:07:48,411 --> 02:07:50,884
- You made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.

2421
02:07:56,460 --> 02:07:58,253
I guess I better give this to you.

2422
02:07:58,254 --> 02:08:01,398
You're gonna have to
carry this now, it's...

2423
02:08:01,591 --> 02:08:04,769
It's got your cheese
balls, your apple juice,

2424
02:08:04,969 --> 02:08:07,095
notebooks, pens and...

2425
02:08:07,096 --> 02:08:09,598
"Who's on First"
video that you like.

2426
02:08:09,599 --> 02:08:11,433
"Who's on First." Very funny.

2427
02:08:11,434 --> 02:08:12,976
I told you it's funny.

2428
02:08:12,977 --> 02:08:14,949
Board!

2429
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,229
Better get going.

2430
02:08:16,230 --> 02:08:17,564
Yeah. Very shiny train.

2431
02:08:17,565 --> 02:08:19,992
Yeah, it sure is.

2432
02:08:20,234 --> 02:08:23,278
Listen, Ray, Dr. Bruner
only has custody of you.

2433
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,156
That doesn't mean I can't visit.

2434
02:08:26,157 --> 02:08:29,117
Now, I'm coming to see
you in two weeks.

2435
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:30,911
How many days is that before
we're gonna be together?

2436
02:08:30,912 --> 02:08:33,246
14 days from today.
Today's Wednesday.

2437
02:08:33,247 --> 02:08:34,623
Hours?

2438
02:08:34,624 --> 02:08:37,083
336 hours.

2439
02:08:37,084 --> 02:08:39,261
Mystifying.

2440
02:08:39,462 --> 02:08:41,630
Course, that's 20,160 minutes.

2441
02:08:41,631 --> 02:08:44,799
1,209,600..

2442
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:46,968
600 seconds.

2443
02:08:46,969 --> 02:08:48,861
Ray?

2444
02:08:49,764 --> 02:08:51,806
Ray?

2445
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:53,608
Ray?

2446
02:08:54,352 --> 02:08:56,153
Yeah.

2447
02:09:00,483 --> 02:09:02,317
I'll see you soon.

2448
02:09:02,318 --> 02:09:05,416
Yeah. One for bad, two for good.

2449
02:09:09,075 --> 02:09:12,344
- Bet two for good.
- Yeah.

2450
02:09:22,755 --> 02:09:25,523
Course, three minutes to Wapner.

2451
02:09:25,967 --> 02:09:28,314
You'll make it.

2452
02:09:29,178 --> 02:09:31,230
Yeah.
