1
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:46,500
- Hello there.
- How are you, Frankie?

2
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,128
- Very well.
- Buddy!

3
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:51,756
- You all right, Paddy?
- Buddy!

4
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,849
You
can't catch me.

5
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,467
I'm gonna
catch you, just wait.

6
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,676
All right?

7
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:58,929
Buddy!

8
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:00,431
Buddy!

9
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,100
Buddy!

10
00:03:04,477 --> 00:03:06,729
I'm speedy, you're not. You're slow.

11
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,147
I'm gonna get you.

12
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,940
Hiya, Moira. How are you?

13
00:03:10,024 --> 00:03:12,360
- Very good, thank you. How are you?
- I'm good.

14
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,195
And he's dribbling. Score now!

15
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,364
Buddy!!

16
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,367
No cheating. I did it fair
and square, I'm telling ya.

17
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:21,577
You nearly got me.

18
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,329
Yes! Dragon slayer!

19
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:24,497
Hey, Buddy!

20
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,665
I win! I slayed the dragon!

21
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,293
Your ma's calling
you! Your tea's ready!

22
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,795
All the rest of you too!

23
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:33,005
Yes!

24
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:34,609
I'll get you
next time, Buddy.

25
00:03:34,633 --> 00:03:35,132
Yes!

26
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,719
- Get back here!
- You dirty bastard!

27
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,683
- Hiya, Buddy.
- Hello, Mrs. Ford.

28
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,561
- Have you been fighting any dragons?
- Only a couple.

29
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,021
I've got a couple in my house.

30
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:50,898
- Is that right, Mr. West?
- Aye.

31
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,764
And can you lend
us a shield, Buddy?

32
00:03:52,788 --> 00:03:54,110
I'll see what I can do.

33
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,070
- Say hello to your daddy for me.
- Will do.

34
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,114
Buddy, your ma's calling you for your tea.

35
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,616
- Thanks, Mrs. Kavanagh.
- She says it's tripe and onions.

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,326
She did not.

37
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,328
- In a sandwich.
- She did not.

38
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:05,746
She says you're a terrible man.

39
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,123
And she's right.

40
00:04:34,316 --> 00:04:36,402
Please. Please, we've done nothing.

41
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:39,113
Get the kids inside!

42
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,575
Get away from here. Go!

43
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,869
We don't want any trouble.

44
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,163
Come on! Get inside!

45
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,593
Mum!

46
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:13,856
Get out of here.

47
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,733
- You've been told.
- Buddy!

48
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,318
Ma!

49
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:18,903
Buddy!

50
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:35,252
'Mum! Mum! Mum!

51
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,671
Keep your head down and don't move.

52
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,591
Will!

53
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:42,801
- Mum!
- Will!

54
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:53,729
- Get in there. Come on.
- Danny, where are you?

55
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,773
Get down and don't move.

56
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,608
Say nothing to nobody.

57
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,401
- Catholics out!
- Easy, lads.

58
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:03,822
Get them upstairs!

59
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:05,157
Catholics out!

60
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,701
Get in the house. Mummy!

61
00:06:07,785 --> 00:06:09,787
All right, come on!

62
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,082
Mummy! What's happening?

63
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,584
Keep him there and stay still.

64
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:22,550
- Mum, what are you doing?
- Will, stay where you are.

65
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,052
Mum!

66
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:30,474
You've been warned!
Get these fuckers out of your street!

67
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,270
And if you talk to the police,
we'll be back for you too!

68
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:36,564
Get the Catholics out!

69
00:06:43,696 --> 00:06:45,573
Clear the street. Get out of it now.

70
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,670
Get down!
Get yourselves down!

71
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,333
Stand back!

72
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,862
<i>Holy God.</i>

73
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,451
<i>Belfast was in shock this morning</i>

74
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,412
<i>as the impact of last night's rioting
was all too clear.</i>

75
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:34,747
<i>Small numbers of Catholics</i>

76
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,083
<i>still peacefully living
in Protestant areas were targeted.</i>

77
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,044
<i>Their houses were attacked and marked,</i>

78
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:43,172
<i>and intimidation may force them
to leave their homes completely.</i>

79
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:44,965
<i>Can these tightly knit neighborhoods</i>

80
00:07:45,049 --> 00:07:48,552
<i>ever return to the peace
they shared together only 24 hours ago?</i>

81
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,137
<i>Further reports suggest...</i>

82
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,723
Up front, Frank.
I'll show you where I put them.

83
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,060
Look, we need to get this barricade up
before those kids come back, okay?

84
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,145
Are we taking
all these paving stones to the barricade?

85
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,397
- Are we taking them all down?
- We need them all.

86
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:02,024
Right.

87
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,942
ls poor Jane okay? Is she all right?

88
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,188
Don't
you worry, Paddy.

89
00:08:05,212 --> 00:08:06,695
We're not gonna let
them back here again.

90
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:08,614
You're as welcome on this street
as any of us.

91
00:08:08,697 --> 00:08:09,473
All
right, Buddy?

92
00:08:09,497 --> 00:08:10,741
We're
gonna have to get more.

93
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,243
We've got four more houses to do
and that's the last pane of glass.

94
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,953
Fergus didn't come home last night.

95
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:16,330
I'm gonna go see Mrs. McGuinness now.

96
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,290
I saw Fergus down the road.
He's coming now.

97
00:08:18,374 --> 00:08:20,751
We have to do this.
The police aren't going to protect us,

98
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,086
so we have to do it ourselves.

99
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,450
Is that all you can
take in a barrow?

100
00:08:23,474 --> 00:08:24,755
Kids,
please, go inside.

101
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:27,174
I don't want you out here
until it's all safe again. Come on.

102
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:29,802
Can you wheel that up to the front?

103
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:31,387
Frankie'|| show you
where we're putting it.

104
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,639
Tell Paddy I'll be there
in a minute to fix that.

105
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:35,432
I've got to nip into the house
and get my tools.

106
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:36,946
Watch yourself
getting up there, love.

107
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:40,062
Put them
pallets over here. Over here.

108
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,565
Get them kids to stay away
from them sharp edges.

109
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,569
- Everything on the floor.
- Put my washing machine in.

110
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,948
Bring them all round.

111
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,741
Keep it coming. We still need more.

112
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,911
Bring it up here. Come on. Keep it coming.

113
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,249
Come on, lads!

114
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,668
<i>The likeliest move is
to bring troops into Belfast</i>

115
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:05,713
<i>in the hope of avoiding further clashes
between rioters and police,</i>

116
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:07,256
<i>particularly the B-Specials.</i>

117
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:08,382
Stand to the side!

118
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,426
<i>Another 600 troops
will be available this afternoon.</i>

119
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,052
Off these streets now!

120
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:17,975
Get off the road. Stand back!

121
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,279
<i>We're not stupid!
You can't keep us in our houses!</i>

122
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:32,740
<i>The men of the 3rd
Battalion of the Light Infantry</i>

123
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>fly in from Plymouth to plug the gap
left by the use of troops.</i>

124
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,871
<i>A curfew is another possibility
which is being widely mentioned.</i>

125
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,497
I've just come from the airport now.

126
00:09:40,581 --> 00:09:42,708
I've literally just come from the airport.
I live in that street.

127
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,668
That's my kids there. I live in number 96.

128
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,714
- Get up there quick. Quick.
- Christ.

129
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,309
Stop.

130
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,928
Just let
him through. His kids...

131
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:56,597
Where do you think you're going, love?

132
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,891
To bring my husband home.
That's him on the other side there.

133
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:01,351
- Where's he been, then?
- None of your bloody business.

134
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,771
Not with you in your hour of need?
That's a bit off, isn't it?

135
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,440
- He works away in England.
- Does he? What kind of work is that?

136
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,066
- He's a joiner.
- I see.

137
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:11,028
Has he joined any of these groups
making all this mess in your street?

138
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,030
He knew nothing about
the whole bloody thing.

139
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,200
That's why he's here now. He's come home
from his work to see his family.

140
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,534
Glad to hear it, madam.

141
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,038
-All right?

142
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:24,583
<i>All residents
in this street please stay indoors.</i>

143
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,418
They nearly had you there, Steve McQueen.

144
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:28,754
- I'll have you in a second, Frankie.
- Come on, you two.

145
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:31,590
Hi, boys.

146
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,550
<i>Stay in your homes tonight.</i>

147
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:35,761
<i>Stay in your homes tonight.
Thank you very much.</i>

148
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,179
- Okay?
- Aye.

149
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:44,061
<i>Space, the final frontier.</i>

150
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,272
<i>These ere the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise...</i>

151
00:10:47,356 --> 00:10:48,398
Did they attack you?

152
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,193
No. It was only the Catholic houses.

153
00:10:51,276 --> 00:10:52,820
Them boyos want them out.

154
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:56,365
Them peoples don't give you any bother
in that street, do they?

155
00:10:56,448 --> 00:11:00,244
Not at all. They're friends,
they're family, same as us.

156
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,205
- They just kick with the left foot.
- Exactly.

157
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,208
Sure, my best friend in the street
is Mrs. Ganjawala.

158
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,169
She's Indian.
She even comes to the wee mission with me.

159
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,839
Them curries. I tried one once.

160
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:14,174
I had to wear a nappy for a week.

161
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:19,638
- Will.
- Oh, Mum. Sorry, Granny.

162
00:11:19,721 --> 00:11:21,515
She's well able to handle herself.

163
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,600
It's being so cheerful
keeps you going, isn't it?

164
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:26,562
I'm not gonna be running up
the Cave Hill anytime soon, am I?

165
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:29,481
- There's just no knowing...
- That's not easy.

166
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,858
...how it's gonna affect their schooling.

167
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,819
Will, would you turn that telly off
and talk to your granny?

168
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,946
- Hi, Pop.
- Hiya, Buddy.

169
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,781
Are you coming for your tea at mine?

170
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,200
Does the doctor wanna see you again?

171
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,328
Aye, he's given me a letter
for the hospital.

172
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,581
- And did you go?
- There's no point.

173
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:52,296
I think you've a few big decisions
to make, Son.

174
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,218
Did you clear up that wee bit of trouble
we were talking about?

175
00:11:58,302 --> 00:12:00,095
Hey, wee fellas.

176
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:02,180
We're not deaf back here.

177
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,860
<i>Yes, we've friends on the Protestant side.</i>

178
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,259
<i>They weren't
friends last night.</i>

179
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,113
<i>They weren't friends
last night, though.</i>

180
00:12:18,196 --> 00:12:21,700
Paddy Kavanagh told me
as long as Catholics keep confessing

181
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:23,619
everything bad that they do to a priest,

182
00:12:23,702 --> 00:12:25,384
then they can do
whatever they want,

183
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:27,331
and God will forgive
them all the time.

184
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:29,708
Well, Paddy Kavanagh's family's
not gonna be living in this street

185
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,239
for much longer, so
you'd better check

186
00:12:31,263 --> 00:12:32,711
he's not taking
the hand out of you.

187
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,254
I don't know how it works.

188
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,771
They get a lot of
water thrown on them

189
00:12:35,795 --> 00:12:37,424
and then they're
okay. I think that's it.

190
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,800
Why aren't you going too?

191
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,219
'Cause me and your father
have business to discuss.

192
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:43,263
God understands. Now, come on.

193
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,726
- What are those?
- My little secret. Now, come on.

194
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:52,397
I've had too much God for one day.

195
00:12:52,481 --> 00:12:55,192
Well, your granny says
you can never have too much God.

196
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,860
You might need him before too long.

197
00:12:56,944 --> 00:12:58,445
Look, mind your nonsense for now

198
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,447
and I'll take youse all
to the pictures tomorrow.

199
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,740
Brilliant!

200
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,743
Robin and the 7 Hoods
is on in the afternoon at the Capitol.

201
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,827
Paddy saw it.

202
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,330
- Wait, is that gangsters?
- It's a blinking musical.

203
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:12,084
No, it's not. There's Little John
and swords and everything.

204
00:13:12,167 --> 00:13:14,586
You can't go tomorrow afternoon.
Your cousins will be here.

205
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,129
Your aunties and uncles
wanna say goodbye

206
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,464
to your father before he goes back.

207
00:13:17,547 --> 00:13:20,842
But, Daddy, are you not gonna be
a vigilante on our barricade?

208
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:23,220
No more talk
about bloody barricades.

209
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,972
That nonsense will stop soon enough.

210
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:26,640
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

211
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:30,227
Hey, less of the long face, Son.

212
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,354
These two can go and pray
for it to stop now,

213
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:34,261
and we'll all go to
the big picture house

214
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:36,108
in town tomorrow,
Daddy will pick the film,

215
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,110
and we'll forget about
this whole bunch of eejits

216
00:13:38,193 --> 00:13:39,653
before I have to go back to work.

217
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:42,531
Was that our side that done all that
to them Catholic houses

218
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,824
in our street, Daddy?

219
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,077
There is no our side and their side
in our street.

220
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:49,538
Or there didn't used to be, anyway.

221
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:52,874
It's all bloody religion,
that's the problem.

222
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,835
Then why are you sending us to church?

223
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:56,795
Because your granny
would kill me if I didn't.

224
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:01,133
But, Daddy, if we were Catholics,
we could not go to church,

225
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:04,511
and then every once in a wee while
we could go in and confess,

226
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,722
and then they'd have to tell us
we were forgiven

227
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,099
and we wouldn't have
to go in again for ages.

228
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:13,687
<i>I've nothing against Catholics,
but it's a religion of fear.</i>

229
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:18,817
Protestants, you will die!

230
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,236
Agonizingly!

231
00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:24,031
And where will you go

232
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:27,534
when you shuffle off
this pestilential mortal coil?

233
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:28,785
Where?

234
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,248
Well, I will tell you where.

235
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:35,959
Picture the scene.

236
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,211
A fork in the road.

237
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:44,134
In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.

238
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:49,347
In the other, a long and winding road

239
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:54,561
which stretches down and away
into an unknowable distance.

240
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:58,982
One will take you
to the bosom of the Lord's grace,

241
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,611
forever and a day caress you
with beatific love.

242
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:07,449
And the other will spew you

243
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:12,496
into an eternal pit of sulfurous,
suffering, pustulating pain

244
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,129
from which you will
never, ever, through

245
00:15:15,153 --> 00:15:17,375
the seven circles
of hell escape.

246
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,337
And I ask you here and now,

247
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,216
which road will you take?

248
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,470
Now, money.

249
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,973
- Thanks very much.
- Thanks very much. Really good.

250
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,609
Remember, one slice per sandwich.

251
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,278
I don't wanna be giving too much away.

252
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:27,913
<i>With regard to the</i>

253
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:29,489
<i>explosive, I think
that's a fair word,</i>

254
00:16:29,573 --> 00:16:31,324
<i>situation in Northern Ireland,</i>

255
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>are we getting near to the point
where you,</i>

256
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,871
<i>as prime minister
of the United Kingdom government,</i>

257
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,581
<i>will feel it necessary to intervene</i>

258
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,375
<i>and use the supreme authority
which is yours in law,</i>

259
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:44,045
<i>either to remedy grievances
or to ensure order?</i>

260
00:16:45,005 --> 00:16:47,299
<i>If that became necessary, of course,</i>

261
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:50,468
<i>I shouldn't shrink
from doing whatever was needed.</i>

262
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,637
<i>Ah, we have been deeply concerned</i>

263
00:16:52,721 --> 00:16:55,557
<i>about the problem of civil rights
in Norfhern Ireland.</i>

264
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,350
<i>I've paid tribute...</i>

265
00:16:57,434 --> 00:16:58,687
Make an
orderly queue to be

266
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:00,187
allowed entrance
to the street, please.

267
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,398
Okay, yes, line up here
for admission to the street.

268
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:04,564
What
have we got left now?

269
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:05,358
One at a time.

270
00:17:05,442 --> 00:17:07,319
Not doing a strip search this time,
eh, Frankie?

271
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,653
Who do you belong to?

272
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:10,363
You know full bloody well
who we belong to.

273
00:17:10,447 --> 00:17:11,907
I'm taking my wife down to her sister's,

274
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,368
like I've been doing
all my bloody life.

275
00:17:13,392 --> 00:17:13,950
House number?

276
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,244
There's no number. Just a name.

277
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:17,495
What's the name?

278
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,331
Arsehole.

279
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:22,292
Very funny, Mack.
Always the joker. On you go.

280
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,711
We won't worry about
their name and number now.

281
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,421
We know where they live.

282
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,883
Whoo! You like that?

283
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,850
How's that, then, Ginger Rogers, huh?

284
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,692
Whoo! Come on you, Fred Astaire.

285
00:17:54,658 --> 00:17:56,868
Whoo!

286
00:18:02,374 --> 00:18:03,708
VVhoo!

287
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,461
- You can tell them by their names.
- How?

288
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:09,798
Well, if he's a Patrick or a Sean,
he's a Catholic,

289
00:18:09,881 --> 00:18:12,092
and if he's a Billy or a William,
he's a Protestant.

290
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,927
There's more names than that, though.

291
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,930
I know that.
I'm just saying, them's the obvious ones.

292
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:22,394
- What about Maurice?
- Ah... Dunno.

293
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,981
We've a wee fella down our street
called Thomas. What's he?

294
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,901
- Protestant definitely.
- He's not. He's a Catholic.

295
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,486
- No, he's not.
- He is.

296
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,241
They burnt his house out the other night
'cause his family is Catholic.

297
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,285
Sure, we've a cousin called Thomas.

298
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,328
I know. That's what I'm saying.

299
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:42,998
Well, how the hell
are you supposed to know, then?

300
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,542
- You have to get taught it.
- Who teaches you?

301
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,087
So the doctor says, "Listen, John,
I've got some bad news and worse."

302
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,464
And John says,
"Oh, no. What's the bad news?"

303
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,592
And he goes,
"Well, you've only got 24 hours to live."

304
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:57,095
John says, "That's awful.
What could be worse than that?"

305
00:18:57,178 --> 00:19:00,140
Doctor says, "Well, I've been trying
to get a hold of you since yesterday."

306
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,184
Why do you even have to know?

307
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:04,769
In case they attack you.

308
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,396
- When?
- When you're out and about.

309
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,814
Well, if they're attacking you,

310
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,691
they're not going to stop
and tell you their name.

311
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:11,776
- It wouldn't get to that stage.
- Why?

312
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,362
'Cause you use your secret knowledge
to bluff them.

313
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:15,989
What are you talking about?

314
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,117
They can just come up to you when
you're not expecting it and ask you,

315
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,286
"Are you Protestant or Catholic?"

316
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,720
But it's a trick
question, you see,

317
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,456
because they don't
tell you what they are.

318
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,958
And what do you say then
to not get a dig in the gob?

319
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,294
- "I'm a Catholic"?
- Wrong.

320
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,046
That's exactly
what they think you will say.

321
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,881
They think you're trying to bluff them.

322
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:35,216
- But you've to double bluff them.
- How?

323
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,594
You say, "I'm a Protestant."

324
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:40,430
- But I am a Protestant.
- That's the point!

325
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,059
Blanchflower's now at the
halfway line. He looks up.

326
00:19:44,142 --> 00:19:47,979
Is there nothing
this Spurs right half cannot do?

327
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:50,398
Perfect through-ball!

328
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,903
Nice pass, son.

329
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,696
Would you go on away in

330
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,574
and tell your pa I'd like to have
a wee chat with him, please?

331
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:02,494
Tell him it's Billy Clanton.

332
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:04,037
And McLaury.

333
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:08,083
What do you want?

334
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,377
We're looking to cleanse
the community a wee bit.

335
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,505
You wouldn't wanna be
the odd man out in this street.

336
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,883
You saw what happened
to your neighbors from the other side.

337
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,386
You touch my family and I'll kill you.

338
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:22,305
Calm down, fella.
I'm a Protestant like yourself.

339
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:24,808
- All all right?
- Aye, it's okay, Mackie.

340
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:28,478
Look, things get out of hand
pretty quick round these parts.

341
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:32,273
Cash or commitment.

342
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:37,654
The boys who cleaned up your street
have made me their new local chief.

343
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,907
So, you can report to me with either.

344
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,991
All right?

345
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,326
Have a wee think.

346
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:45,328
I'll be in touch.

347
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,379
Buddy, come on. Come and
show me how to play this game.

348
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:56,506
Come on. Let's have a look, huh?

349
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,651
All the big boys have left.

350
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,487
Buddy, give your brother a hand
there. Pick this sofa up, right?

351
00:21:19,571 --> 00:21:22,532
- Here, can you give us a hand?
- Yes, ma'am.

352
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,076
Wanna put your gun down?

353
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,619
No, it's all right, thank you.

354
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,415
Don't you be scratching my walls
with that.

355
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,959
Got it? Right. Now, hold on.
This worked earlier.

356
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,128
I'll go in first.

357
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,090
- All right?
- Stewart.

358
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:41,050
- Frankie.
- All right?

359
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,928
All right, Frankie? Is that you
all this time at the barricades?

360
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:46,973
Somebody has to.
Better me than Billy Clanton.

361
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,435
- Aye.
- Not many people chose this.

362
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,353
There's a few men
hiding behind them barricades.

363
00:21:52,437 --> 00:21:54,731
And they'll keep hiding
where they're afraid for their families.

364
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:56,274
It's a waiting game now.

365
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:58,952
When it's time for
that wall to come down,

366
00:21:58,976 --> 00:22:01,070
I'll be first to swing
a hammer, but now?

367
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,823
"They also serve who stand and wait."

368
00:22:06,034 --> 00:22:08,119
We can't all be acting the Lone Ranger.

369
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,344
<i>This is a
story of long, long ago,</i>

370
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:26,554
<i>when the world was just beginning.</i>

371
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:28,181
<i>A young world.</i>

372
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:30,642
<i>A world early in the morning of time.</i>

373
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,574
Well, no wonder you brought us to this.

374
00:22:47,408 --> 00:22:49,369
It's educational for the boys.

375
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,579
Aye.

376
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,042
Raquel Welch is a hell of an education.

377
00:23:05,009 --> 00:23:07,595
If people ask you to join anything,
deliver anything,

378
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,431
do messages for anybody,
you do nothing, okay?

379
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,849
You tell your ma, she'll tell me,

380
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,518
and I'll sort it. You understand me?

381
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,520
- Yes, Daddy.
- Very good.

382
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:18,523
I'm proud of you, Son.
Now get off to bed, the pair of you.

383
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm up too early in the morning
to see you,

384
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,777
so make sure you get to
school all right. All right?

385
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,530
Don't mess your mother about,
and I'll see you in two weeks, okay?

386
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,407
- Yes, Daddy.
- Good boys.

387
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,285
<i>A fork in the road.</i>

388
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:36,499
<i>In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.</i>

389
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,587
<i>Which road will you take?</i>

390
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,760
You're running round here
like the man in the big picture,

391
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:50,471
not paying your taxes
and spending all our money on horses.

392
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:53,433
It's the building trade.
I told you it doesn't work the normal way.

393
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:55,935
- I told you I had it covered.
- I was the one who had it covered.

394
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,021
No, you had us paying
three years of back tax.

395
00:23:58,104 --> 00:23:59,439
To keep you out of bloody jail.

396
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,858
We're drowning in debt.

397
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,818
We're near done with the back tax.

398
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:06,029
Ten pound a month for three bloody years.

399
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:08,281
This is the time to think about
making a new start.

400
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,075
I know nothing else but Belfast.

401
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,160
Exactly.

402
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:14,829
There's a whole world out there.

403
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,707
We can give these boys
a better chance than we ever had.

404
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,126
There's Commonwealth countries
needing tradesmen.

405
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:22,712
The government
will give you assisted passage.

406
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:26,466
We can get the whole family to
the other side of the world for ten pound.

407
00:24:26,549 --> 00:24:28,051
We're living in a civil war,

408
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,762
and I'm not here to protect my family.

409
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:35,933
What are those supposed to be?

410
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,769
An escape route.

411
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:47,904
Get this
street locked down.

412
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,113
Come on. Get a move on.

413
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:51,532
- We're gonna be late again.
- Come on!

414
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:53,967
<i>Throughout the night,</i>

415
00:24:53,991 --> 00:24:55,620
<i>sn/p/ng became the
tact/c of the r/oters.</i>

416
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,999
<i>As we drove past a side street,
three men on the corner dived for cover.</i>

417
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,086
<i>A young man with a revolver
asked us for a lift.</i>

418
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:07,340
<i>At 4:00 this morning,
RUC turned us back from the Falls area.</i>

419
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,342
<i>Snipers, they said, were still at work,</i>

420
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,471
<i>and in the distance, one heard
the ominous burst of machine-gun fire.</i>

421
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:14,972
<i>The scene terrified me,</i>

422
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,725
<i>but it reminded
an American colleague of Harlem,</i>

423
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:20,228
<i>but, he added,
it seems easier to get guns here.</i>

424
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:21,354
One more left.

425
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,940
<i>Dawn over Belfast today
showed a grim scene,</i>

426
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:25,858
<i>buildings scarred by fire,</i>

427
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:27,944
<i>thousands of pounds' worth
of damage caused,</i>

428
00:25:28,027 --> 00:25:30,530
<i>and, of course, the tragic loss of life.</i>

429
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,740
<i>It's been a night of shame for Belfast,</i>

430
00:25:32,824 --> 00:25:34,617
<i>one that will live on in the memories...</i>

431
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:36,202
Come on, you two. School.

432
00:25:41,874 --> 00:25:45,086
- Walking, please. No running.
- Good morning, miss.

433
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:49,716
Twelve elevens are 132.

434
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:52,844
Twelve twelves are 144.

435
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,012
Well, I'm pleased to say your times tables

436
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:57,807
were more impressive to hear
than your test scores were to read.

437
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:00,685
The whole point of these weekly tests
is to monitor your progress.

438
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:04,647
The best will sit directly by my desk,
the seat of learning,

439
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,816
and the rest of you
will view your Sisyphean struggles

440
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,943
from the distance
you have imposed upon yourself

441
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,153
by a lack of application.

442
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:14,657
Billy Clanton Junior, 17%.
Bottom row, seat 12.

443
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:16,576
Rachel, seat 11.

444
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,245
Martin to seat ten. Freddie, seat eight.

445
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,164
Karen to seat four.

446
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,624
And in the medal positions this week,

447
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:27,420
with 72%, in bronze, is Buddy, seat three.

448
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:31,883
And, of course, in silver again,
we have Ron,

449
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,427
and Catherine with the gold
yet again this week.

450
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,637
Congratulations, Catherine.
Very well done.

451
00:26:42,602 --> 00:26:45,062
The wee girl
still showing some interest, yeah?

452
00:26:46,355 --> 00:26:48,024
She looks at me sometimes,

453
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,109
but we're not allowed to talk
in the class,

454
00:26:50,193 --> 00:26:51,861
so I can't say anything.

455
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:53,934
And then when we go
out to the playground,

456
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,948
she always goes off
with the other girls.

457
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,285
Anyways,
I think she loves that other fella.

458
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,496
You don't know that for sure.

459
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:03,790
Women are very mysterious.

460
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:06,334
And women
can smash your face in too, mister.

461
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:09,420
Your granny's become less mysterious
over the years.

462
00:27:09,504 --> 00:27:11,172
So, you really like her?

463
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:14,175
When I grow up, I want to marry her.

464
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:16,511
Yeah, sounds like you really like her.

465
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:19,305
You know, she's not only at school.

466
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:21,390
You could see where she lives, maybe.

467
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,644
It's Reynolds Drive,
four houses in from the right,

468
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,103
the one with the wonky eight.

469
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:27,939
You've done your research.

470
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:30,566
I pass it every day on my way home.

471
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,653
I try to look in, but she never sees me.

472
00:27:33,736 --> 00:27:36,030
She's always doing her bloody homework.

473
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:37,853
If she were a wee
bit more stupid like

474
00:27:37,877 --> 00:27:39,617
me, we'd be sitting
together by now.

475
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,038
Ah. "A pity beyond all telling
is hid in the heart of love."

476
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:46,332
He's full of pretty answers, that one.

477
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:47,750
Come on. It's time to go.

478
00:27:47,834 --> 00:27:50,253
I don't want your mammy
shouting at me because you're late.

479
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:52,296
- Cheerio, Son.
- Cheerio.

480
00:27:55,842 --> 00:28:00,263
Here, take this threepenny bit.
Get yourself a wee sweetie.

481
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:04,058
I'm not allowed, Granny.
My da says you can't afford it.

482
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,601
I'm always saying to your man there,

483
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:07,645
"What's yours is mine
and what's mine's me own."

484
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,564
Thanks, Granny.

485
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:12,775
Try and find out how that wee girl thinks.

486
00:28:12,859 --> 00:28:15,444
Good luck with that one, Son.

487
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:53,274
- Give me the ball!
- Pass it. Pass it. Goal!

488
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:58,362
Yes, mate. You just need to tell us
where you've been, all right?

489
00:29:00,323 --> 00:29:01,782
Yeah, up against the wall.

490
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:10,750
Will.

491
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,419
Will.

492
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,131
What road do we take?

493
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:18,674
I can't remember.

494
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,844
What road did the minister say?

495
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:22,970
Shut up.

496
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:32,605
<i>And in this already tense atmosphere,</i>

497
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:36,901
<i>concerns remain about intimidation
run rife in working-class areas.</i>

498
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,194
<i>Further reports suggest...</i>

499
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:40,863
Get your arse up here.
Stop dragging your arse along there.

500
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,228
You're
hurting my arm.

501
00:29:42,252 --> 00:29:43,532
Stop being
a crybaby now.

502
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:45,993
- You show me where he lives.
- Daddy, I'm sorry.

503
00:29:46,661 --> 00:29:48,079
You tell me exactly what he said.

504
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:49,414
He
just said he couldn't

505
00:29:49,438 --> 00:29:50,623
give any more
money to the streets.

506
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:52,019
He'll not
say that to my son.

507
00:29:52,043 --> 00:29:52,583
Daddy, stop!

508
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,251
- Stewart! Stewart!
- Please!

509
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:56,963
Your blood's up there, Billy.
Would you go back to your house?

510
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,923
Billy, we've no call for fists here.

511
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,425
Aye? Well, what is it the man says?

512
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,512
A fist is only as good or bad
as the man using it.

513
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:05,763
Remember that.

514
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,977
Holy God. Billy!

515
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,103
Shut up, Frankie!

516
00:30:12,186 --> 00:30:13,813
Come on, Billy. That's too much now.

517
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:15,564
We don't need more of this, Billy.

518
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,025
Billy, stop that.
You're settling old scores.

519
00:30:18,109 --> 00:30:19,110
Regards to your pa.

520
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:23,531
Tell him I expect to hear from him soon,
or he'll be hearing from me.

521
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:24,824
Up them stairs.

522
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:35,042
23, 24, 25, 26! Whoo!

523
00:30:40,923 --> 00:30:41,966
What are you doing?

524
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:46,679
It's, like, what my favorite holiday is.

525
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,222
What is your favorite holiday?

526
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,267
I don't know.
We haven't been on many, have we?

527
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,351
No, we haven't.

528
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:02,361
Unbelievable.
They're not getting away with this.

529
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:05,406
And it's due today as well,
so I can't do anything about it.

530
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,328
- Hello, Buddy.
- Hello, Mr. West.

531
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:13,873
- Right, on you go now.
- Thanks, Mr. West.

532
00:31:18,252 --> 00:31:19,825
Will you ask your
da to drop down to

533
00:31:19,849 --> 00:31:21,422
see us when he's
back at the weekend?

534
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,007
He's not back at the weekend.

535
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,010
That's a pity. Tell your ma
I was asking after him, will you?

536
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:27,178
- Aye.
- Tell your brother

537
00:31:27,261 --> 00:31:29,013
I need another wee delivery with the milk.

538
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:32,308
Get him to come and see me
after school. All right?

539
00:31:34,602 --> 00:31:36,437
Why is your da not coming home?

540
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,397
He can't come home every weekend.

541
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:40,566
It's too dear.

542
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:43,486
You won't get your wee Matchbox car then,
will you?

543
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:50,367
Come on.

544
00:31:51,118 --> 00:31:52,119
Corning.

545
00:31:53,704 --> 00:31:55,706
- Do you wanna join a gang?
- I'm not allowed.

546
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:58,292
- Why not?
- My mother said she'd kill me.

547
00:31:58,375 --> 00:32:00,669
She doesn't have to know.
That's the whole point.

548
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,088
- Are you in one?
- Aye.

549
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:03,798
- What's it called?
- Doesn't have a name.

550
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,633
- Why not?
- Has to be secret.

551
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,259
That's what they tell you when you join.

552
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:08,385
What do you do?

553
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:11,222
I can't tell you till you're in the gang.

554
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:14,058
- How many of you are there?
- Not allowed to say.

555
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,228
- What do you have to do to join then?
- Whatever they tell you.

556
00:32:19,105 --> 00:32:22,399
If your da's not home this
weekend, you could come with us.

557
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:25,069
I don't know.
I'm trying to practice my maths.

558
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:27,154
Then you're mental.
Come on.

559
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:30,074
If your da's not home anyway,
what else are you gonna do?

560
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,164
Ah, come on.

561
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,507
God. This takes ages.

562
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,551
No wonder they call it long division.

563
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:34,763
Patience. Patience with the sums.
Patience with the girl.

564
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,391
Is it 27?

565
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:40,102
It's close enough.

566
00:33:40,895 --> 00:33:44,190
I'll just make sure
your numbers aren't very clear to read.

567
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:46,025
She might give you
the benefit of the doubt

568
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:50,946
if your seven looks like a one
with a fancy tail, right?

569
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:55,117
The same with a two and a six, right?
Keep her guessing.

570
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,245
That means you'll have
two or three horses in every race.

571
00:33:58,329 --> 00:33:59,538
Isn't that cheating?

572
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:03,042
Well, I'd call it spread betting.

573
00:34:03,125 --> 00:34:05,586
And if it gets you moved up by one seat

574
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,923
to bask in the light of her glory,
then you're off to the races.

575
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:11,592
But sure there's only one right answer.

576
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,718
If that were true, Son,

577
00:34:12,801 --> 00:34:15,512
people wouldn't be
blowing themselves up all over this town.

578
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,645
I think my da wants us to leave Belfast.

579
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,817
What do you want?

580
00:34:30,236 --> 00:34:34,323
Every night, before I go to sleep,
when I say my prayers,

581
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:38,160
I ask God if he'd fix it
so that when I wake up in the morning,

582
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:40,329
I'm the best footballer in the world.

583
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:42,873
And then I also ask him, as well,

584
00:34:42,957 --> 00:34:45,834
that when I grow up,
can I marry Catherine?

585
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,586
Even if she loves Ronnie Boyd.

586
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:50,381
But she could still see him,
but she'd marry me.

587
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:51,966
That's what I want.

588
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,434
You looking for trouble, Doniphon?

589
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,061
<i>You aim to help me find some?</i>

590
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:06,981
<i>What's the matter?</i>

591
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,900
<i>Everybody in this
country kill crazy? Here!</i>

592
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,070
<i>Show's over for now.</i>

593
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:16,573
<i>Try it, Liberty.</i>

594
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,368
<i>Just try it.</i>

595
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:22,037
<i>What right do you have
to interfere? It was me he tricked.</i>

596
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,831
I have to keep those boys
where I can see 'em.

597
00:35:23,914 --> 00:35:25,249
<i>Well, I can't come home
every weekend, for God's sake.</i>

598
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,251
If you can't be bothered, don't blame me

599
00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,420
- for what them boys get up to.
<i>- That's not what I'm saying.</i>

600
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,547
<i>You can't just throw that one...</i>

601
00:35:33,785 --> 00:35:35,342
Right,
that's 6:00 a.m., fellas.

602
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:36,427
That's youse done.

603
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:42,349
<i>Housewives, it's thanks
to Sparkle biological washing powder</i>

604
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,643
<i>that their whites are whiter than ever.</i>

605
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,229
What have I done?

606
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,025
<i>As well as brightening,
it's the softest wash...</i>

607
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,609
All right, Mummy?

608
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,529
Why do you always get sad
when a letter comes?

609
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,031
<i>A mother's dream.</i>

610
00:35:57,114 --> 00:36:00,034
<i>Remember, our washing powder
is biological.</i>

611
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:05,414
Come on, Mr. Slow Coach. Get inside now.

612
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,876
And finally a switch
in the medal positions this week.

613
00:36:08,959 --> 00:36:12,004
Well, Mr. Buddy, you may not have improved
your handwriting in maths,

614
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,340
for which, this once,
in lieu of your intensified efforts,

615
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,633
we will be willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

616
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:18,677
but you have improved your score.

617
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:22,723
So, in second position is Buddy.

618
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,516
Yay!

619
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:21,323
<i>Be careful What you wish for.</i>

620
00:37:21,407 --> 00:37:24,076
<i>That's what the minister
at the wee mission says.</i>

621
00:37:25,327 --> 00:37:27,121
When is your next chance?

622
00:37:27,204 --> 00:37:30,165
We have to do a project
about the moon landing.

623
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,334
Did those boys not come back from that?

624
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:35,337
They did, and now we have to cut things
out of the papers

625
00:37:35,421 --> 00:37:37,381
and explain how they got there.

626
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,466
If they did get there,
if they did get to the moon,

627
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:42,302
it's not what it says here.
God doesn't like it.

628
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:46,056
And I watched every night, too,
that they were up there,

629
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,269
and how did I never see Mike Collins
in the mother ship doing his orbit?

630
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,020
Surely you would've seen
the shape of Columbus

631
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,272
against the light of the moon.

632
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:55,482
That's 'cause mostly
he was on the dark side.

633
00:37:55,566 --> 00:37:58,068
Exactly. It's the side that Lucifer
hangs his shillelagh.

634
00:37:58,152 --> 00:38:01,155
No, he was on the dark side
of the moon most of the time

635
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:03,657
where we couldn't see him
while he was doing his orbit,

636
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,161
and then maybe just before he
was due to come round the corner,

637
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,662
you had to go in for your tea.

638
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:11,248
If I could come up
with something smart about that,

639
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:15,002
maybe I could stay up at the top desk
and wait till she gets back there.

640
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:18,005
Or you could say the moon's made of
green cheese and drop down a place.

641
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:21,758
Or you could do the project
together, you and the young lady.

642
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:25,179
You'd get the same marks and maybe
end up on the same seat together.

643
00:38:25,262 --> 00:38:27,222
But how do I even talk to her?

644
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,111
Yeah, it's all rigmarole
with you, mister.

645
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,955
Walk, please.

646
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:35,082
No running, thank you.

647
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:36,375
Thanks.

648
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,336
Well done on your maths.

649
00:39:39,419 --> 00:39:40,504
Thanks.

650
00:39:41,213 --> 00:39:42,881
Have you gone to the moon yet?

651
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:46,218
Do you want to, with me?

652
00:39:47,594 --> 00:39:50,597
It'll save you getting cold
waiting outside our house.

653
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:56,270
Hey, Romeo, come on!

654
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,771
We have work to do.

655
00:39:58,605 --> 00:40:01,650
Operation Steal the Chocolate.
It's simple.

656
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,361
We go into the shop and keep
Mr. Singh talking down by the fridge.

657
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,698
He has to move the boxes round
at the bottom to get me a Lemon Mivvi.

658
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:09,616
His head will be down part of the time.

659
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:13,787
You stay at the front of the shop,
and when you see he's not looking,

660
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,955
you make a sweep.

661
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,039
What's a sweep?

662
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:18,917
A big grab for all the chocolate bars
on that low shelf near the till.

663
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,378
He'll know they've been nicked
if there's a big gap.

664
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:25,007
I thought you said we'd just do a couple,
so he'd never even notice.

665
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,676
- I don't want lifted by the police.
- All right, all right.

666
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,637
- All clear.
- No sweep. Just a small grab, okay?

667
00:40:30,721 --> 00:40:33,015
I might be able to swipe you
a chocolate mousse at the same time.

668
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:34,099
Okay.

669
00:40:39,104 --> 00:40:39,956
Hello,
Mr. Singh.

670
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,481
Hello,
Moira. Hello, Buddy.

671
00:40:41,565 --> 00:40:42,216
Good to see youse.

672
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,775
Please may I
have a Lemon Mivvi?

673
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:45,539
Lemon Mivvi coming right up.

674
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:47,070
Just need to move
a few wee boxes.

675
00:40:47,154 --> 00:40:48,238
Hey!

676
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:49,406
He's seen us!

677
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:51,325
Come here, you wee buggers!
I know who you are!

678
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:52,534
No, he does not!

679
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:54,745
Well, your
woman will tell him anyway.

680
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,456
- You proud of yourself?
- It was Moira.

681
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,540
Get in there.

682
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,834
Get off that blinking road
or you'll kill somebody!

683
00:41:00,917 --> 00:41:04,921
- She's gonna tell on us!
- She says anything, she's done for!

684
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:06,256
I know who youse are.

685
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:13,013
What have you got?

686
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,891
You're joking me.

687
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:19,603
- It's all I could see.
- Turkish Delight?

688
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:22,898
Who the hell eats Turkish Delight?
Do you eat Turkish Delight?

689
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,067
No. I don't like it.

690
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,818
Nobody likes it.

691
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:30,072
- It's all they had.
- Are you blind?

692
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:32,949
- I had to think quickly.
- Not quickly enough.

693
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,952
There was Flakes and Crunchies.

694
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,163
All you need is an in and out
with a fast hand

695
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,957
and then the Milkybars are on me.

696
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,918
I'm not sure you're cut out for this.

697
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,380
- Hey, Buddy, your da's home.
- It's only Wednesday.

698
00:41:46,463 --> 00:41:48,048
He came in a taxi.

699
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,093
- And you too.
- What?

700
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:53,220
Keep your mouth shut.

701
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:01,561
- When did you write to them?
- None of your business.

702
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:04,231
Just tell me. When did you write
to them? It's a simple question.

703
00:42:04,314 --> 00:42:06,692
- None of your business.
- Just give me a simple answer.

704
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:09,069
- I'm not getting interrogated.
- When did you write to them?

705
00:42:09,152 --> 00:42:10,612
When the last receipt came through.

706
00:42:10,696 --> 00:42:12,656
I knew it was the last one
'cause for three bloody years

707
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:14,825
I've been counting them envelopes
coming through that door,

708
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:17,077
and there wasn't so much
as a thank-you with this one.

709
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:20,372
It's the taxman, for God's sake.
Who do you expect, Father Christmas?

710
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:23,959
We've been scrimping and saving
and they hadn't the good grace as to say,

711
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,044
"That's it. You're done.
You're in the clear."

712
00:42:26,128 --> 00:42:28,046
So what's you say to them in your letter?

713
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,091
I said I wanted
a full official declaration

714
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:34,970
that my husband was in the clear 100%
on all back taxes,

715
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,138
and that they acknowledged

716
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,640
that everything was shipshape
and aboveboard,

717
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:42,144
and that my family's good name
wasn't on some credit risk list.

718
00:42:42,227 --> 00:42:44,312
- Christ. Christ the night.
- What?

719
00:42:48,859 --> 00:42:50,610
No. No.

720
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:52,237
Yes, yes. Oh, yes.

721
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,614
They've decided...
Thanks to acting on your request,

722
00:42:54,698 --> 00:42:57,325
they've decided to go back further
into my accounts

723
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,661
and say that I owe another £572,

724
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:02,956
which based on current earnings
should take another five years to pay off.

725
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,916
So that's a handy wee letter
you sent, wasn't it?

726
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,295
You bugger! You're a lying bugger!

727
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,964
That's right, believe the taxman
before you believe me.

728
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:12,966
'Cause I know you!

729
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:19,389
Your work won't be too pleased
with you skipping off in the week.

730
00:43:19,473 --> 00:43:21,141
I'll work the weekend.

731
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:22,726
When's that job finish?

732
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:24,561
This one's nearly done.

733
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,063
What, there's another
one over there, is there?

734
00:43:27,147 --> 00:43:30,358
Aye. Big one. A long one.

735
00:43:30,442 --> 00:43:32,861
They're asking some of the boys
to move over permanent.

736
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:35,322
Offering accommodation
because of the time involved.

737
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,741
Couple of years. Building a hospital.

738
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:40,869
Your father has to go to the hospital.

739
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,456
You talk to him about it.
Won't talk to me about doctors.

740
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:47,375
- Is that right?
- It's just a couple of days.

741
00:43:47,459 --> 00:43:49,544
A wee test for the lungs.

742
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,838
It's all that bloody time
over in Leicester.

743
00:43:51,922 --> 00:43:54,007
- Where's that?
- In England.

744
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:55,509
Is that near where Daddy works?

745
00:43:55,592 --> 00:43:58,220
Your daddy works near London,
the Big Smoke.

746
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:00,639
This was in the countryside.

747
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:03,892
- What were you doing?
- I was a coal miner.

748
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,852
You've done a lot of different jobs, Pop.

749
00:44:05,936 --> 00:44:06,978
You can say that again.

750
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:09,439
Yeah, none of them lasted
more than a week.

751
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,859
My mother's worried about you.

752
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,653
Your mother's worried about you.

753
00:44:16,238 --> 00:44:19,783
Granny's always worried
about something, isn't she?

754
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:21,952
Well, your granny's a very caring person.

755
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:25,997
Sometimes it affects her nerves.
Like your mummy.

756
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,375
Mummy's worried too, isn't she?

757
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:35,382
Daddy, are we gonna have to leave Belfast?

758
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,470
All right, Buddy,
that's me away, then.

759
00:44:40,554 --> 00:44:42,055
I'll see you when I get back next week.

760
00:44:42,138 --> 00:44:43,932
In you come,
girls. Catherine. Quinn.

761
00:44:44,015 --> 00:44:45,851
Morning, girls.
You can help me put the pencils out.

762
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:47,561
Be good, Son.

763
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:49,062
And if you can't be good?

764
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,897
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

765
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:55,694
Seems like only yesterday you and me
were in school together.

766
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,406
You're gonna need
to stay away from my family.

767
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:01,783
That's big talk
for a fella who's never here.

768
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:03,910
You can rely on me to be here
when it matters.

769
00:45:03,994 --> 00:45:05,370
I hope your timing's good.

770
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:07,998
Things get out of hand pretty quick
around these parts.

771
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,836
Do you know the problem with men like you?

772
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,172
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

773
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:19,259
And the problem with men like you
is you know you're not.

774
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,221
We'll keep it simple.

775
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,183
You're with us or you're against us.

776
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:28,476
Clock's ticking.

777
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,855
You're a soft touch. Time
for real Protestants to step up.

778
00:45:31,938 --> 00:45:33,315
You're no real Protestant.

779
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,400
You're a jumped-up gangster
and always were.

780
00:45:53,168 --> 00:45:55,170
There's peelers about.
Watch it, youse two.

781
00:45:55,253 --> 00:45:56,254
Quick.

782
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:07,557
Oh, look. There you are now, Son.

783
00:46:07,641 --> 00:46:09,684
There he is now.

784
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:17,275
Hello, Son. The police officer here
just wants a wee word with you.

785
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,985
There seems to be a wee bit of confusion

786
00:46:19,069 --> 00:46:21,071
about something that happened
at Mr. Singh's.

787
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,114
Go on, sit down there, now.

788
00:46:28,662 --> 00:46:30,664
Do you know why I'm here, son?

789
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,791
Don't lie to me.

790
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:37,253
A very serious crime has been committed
down in Mr. Singh's shop.

791
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,297
Do you know what I'm talking about?

792
00:46:42,926 --> 00:46:45,261
All the best, now,
and give my regards to Josie.

793
00:46:45,345 --> 00:46:46,127
I will do.

794
00:46:46,151 --> 00:46:47,847
I do like a man in a uniform.

795
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,308
Was he in there long?

796
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:53,061
Apples will grow again,
should they grow on a gooseberry tree.

797
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,980
I didn't even eat the chocolate!

798
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,441
<i>No, I won't be here when it's over.</i>

799
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,901
<i>You're asking me to wait an hour</i>

800
00:46:59,985 --> 00:47:02,404
<i>to find out if I'm going to be a wife
or a widow.</i>

801
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:05,073
<i>I say it's too long to wait.
I won't do it.</i>

802
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,366
<i>- Amy...
- I mean it.</i>

803
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:10,245
<i>If you won't go with me now,
I'll be on that train when it leaves here.</i>

804
00:47:11,955 --> 00:47:13,206
<i>I've got to stay.</i>

805
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,291
No, you're not listening to me.

806
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:18,586
<i>I am listening. I am listening.</i>
<i>Would you listen to me for a change?</i>

807
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:20,338
<i>I'm trying to be practical about this.</i>

808
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:22,716
Look, the police were here today,
but their father wasn't,

809
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,218
so, no, I'll not be having
any lectures from you, mister.

810
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:26,761
<i>I know what you're gonna...</i>

811
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:14,642
<i>Clear the streets
and return to your homes.</i>

812
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:20,690
<i>Return to your homes.</i>

813
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,530
Oi. Yes, I'm open.

814
00:48:28,323 --> 00:48:29,908
- Catch it.
- Mine, mine, mine!

815
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,618
Pass to me, pass to me!

816
00:48:31,701 --> 00:48:32,744
Mrs. Ford, how you doing?

817
00:48:32,827 --> 00:48:34,704
All the better for seeing you, stranger.

818
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:36,915
- Welcome home.
- You're a silver-tongued charmer.

819
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,249
It takes one to know one.

820
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:39,793
- Hiya.
- All right?

821
00:48:39,876 --> 00:48:42,337
Just the fella.
Have you got a horse for the 2:30 race?

822
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:44,255
I have, but if I tell you,
the odds will come down.

823
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,466
Christ, I'm not gonna bet the house.

824
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:48,718
Fancy Man, each way.
Should get you a pint.

825
00:48:48,802 --> 00:48:51,471
- Is that Paddy moving out?
- Poor Catholics have no choice.

826
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,181
- It's a mad world.
- Well, get used to it.

827
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:54,599
We all live there now.

828
00:48:55,809 --> 00:49:00,313
<i>Prize capture was a tanker
laden with 2,500 gallons of petrol.</i>

829
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:03,817
<i>They'd also taken dozens of crates
of milk bottles from a passing truck</i>

830
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,111
<i>and dubbed the whole enterprise
the Petrol Bomb Factory...</i>

831
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:09,030
All the kids in the street are going mad.

832
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,698
What do you want me to do?

833
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,408
You need to talk to them boys.

834
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:21,209
How many was there?

835
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:22,460
About ten of them.

836
00:49:23,378 --> 00:49:24,838
And what did your mate do?

837
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:29,634
He said he wasn't joining
anything they belonged to.

838
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:32,929
Then he gave the big one a dig in the gob
and ran like hell.

839
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:34,514
So did I.

840
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:35,932
Did they chase you?

841
00:49:36,975 --> 00:49:38,977
Aye, but we got a street ahead of them.

842
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,312
Then we ran into my uncle Tony's
and turned the corner

843
00:49:41,396 --> 00:49:42,689
before they could see us.

844
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,400
We put the heart across my uncle Tony.

845
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,485
He was on the toilet, doing his horses,

846
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:49,696
and then he dropped his pencil
down the loo.

847
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,616
You've delivered
for these boys before, aye?

848
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:54,701
Mm-hmm.

849
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:59,289
And you know it's not milk they're
putting back in them empty bottles?

850
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:01,416
We do now, Daddy.

851
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,545
You were right to tell me.

852
00:50:08,882 --> 00:50:10,466
Come here and hold this, Son.

853
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:13,261
Hold that there.

854
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:19,851
- You got that?
- Mm-hmm.

855
00:50:19,934 --> 00:50:22,812
<i>And amid more city-wide violence overnight,</i>

856
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:25,982
<i>government figures issued today
reveal that Northern Ireland now has</i>

857
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,484
<i>the highest rate of unemployment
in the UK.</i>

858
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:30,528
Here it is. Planet Earth.

859
00:50:30,612 --> 00:50:32,280
Do you know where that is?

860
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,615
- Sydney...

861
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,783
- Australia?
- Aye, that's right.

862
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,452
- Do you know about it?
- Aye.

863
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:39,078
They've got surfing and weird football.

864
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:40,955
And they have kangaroos on the barbecue.

865
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:42,373
And the weather's good.

866
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,375
Young Joe Turner's down there too.

867
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:45,710
That's right.

868
00:50:45,793 --> 00:50:47,754
How do you fancy that?

869
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:51,174
- What?
- Moving over there for a wee while.

870
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,550
You're joking.

871
00:50:52,634 --> 00:50:54,427
No. It's just down the side a wee bit.

872
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:57,847
It's 10,500 miles.
Right, school, you two. Now.

873
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:05,772
We might as well be going to the moon
if we went down there.

874
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:08,483
- Sure, you've already family there.
- One second cousin.

875
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,109
And you've the phone.

876
00:51:10,193 --> 00:51:12,153
And a millionaire to pay the bills?

877
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,489
We could take trips back.

878
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:16,699
And pay for it with what? Scotch mist?

879
00:51:16,783 --> 00:51:19,035
Family could come over for holidays.

880
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,787
I didn't come up the lough in a bubble.

881
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:23,539
There's no one from round here
can afford the fare to go down there,

882
00:51:23,623 --> 00:51:26,042
or the time off work if they had any work.

883
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:29,420
- You just heard the bloody news.
- We have to do something.

884
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:31,089
This is our home.

885
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:08,793
I hope you're feeling confident, Daddy.

886
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,047
Don't worry.

887
00:52:20,263 --> 00:52:21,764
He's away the night again?

888
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,267
Aye, he can't neglect his work.

889
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:28,271
- Sure, there's work here.
- Have you read the papers?

890
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:31,274
You'd break my heart to leave, but...

891
00:52:32,775 --> 00:52:34,235
you have to think of them.

892
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:39,282
We can't all leave.
There'll be nobody left but the nutters.

893
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:44,912
Aye, and nobody to cook their tea,
run messages and wipe their arses.

894
00:52:44,996 --> 00:52:47,790
That'd make the violence stop
in about ten minutes.

895
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,129
How could I leave Belfast?

896
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,548
I wouldn't worry about it.

897
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:57,342
The Irish were born for leaving.

898
00:52:58,092 --> 00:53:00,845
Otherwise the rest of the world
would have no pubs.

899
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,390
It just needs half of us to stay,

900
00:53:04,474 --> 00:53:07,935
so that the other half can get sentimental
about the ones that went.

901
00:53:09,145 --> 00:53:12,315
All the Irish need to survive
is a phone, a Guinness

902
00:53:12,398 --> 00:53:14,567
and the sheet music to "Danny Boy."

903
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:17,445
You're a terrible woman, you know that?

904
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,864
He shoots, he scores.

905
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,211
I'll see you soon, okay?

906
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:39,675
- Can you take her home?
- Take care of yourself, okay?

907
00:53:39,759 --> 00:53:44,097
Come on, now, missus.
We must go as well. Come on, now.

908
00:53:57,193 --> 00:54:00,029
- Violet, can I ask you a question?
- What?

909
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:03,282
- What did you do with the money?
- What money?

910
00:54:03,366 --> 00:54:05,910
The money your ma gave you
for singing lessons.

911
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:10,164
<i>All passengers
departing on the Heysham Ferry</i>

912
00:54:10,248 --> 00:54:12,193
<i>should proceed to
the boarding area now.</i>

913
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,919
Everybody's leaving home.

914
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,463
People have to move on.

915
00:54:20,383 --> 00:54:24,929
"Too long a sacrifice
Can make a stone of the heart."

916
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:26,848
Is that what does it?

917
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:30,601
Yeah, well, you don't usually buy
your wisdom with a walk in the park.

918
00:54:30,685 --> 00:54:32,937
Your heart has to explode.

919
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,064
Mr. Philosopher.

920
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:37,483
And when did your heart ever explode?

921
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:41,696
That time I saw you
in those brown stockings.

922
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:45,283
Holy God.

923
00:54:45,366 --> 00:54:46,742
I remember that.

924
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:53,458
It took me half the day just staining
my legs brown with the tobacco water.

925
00:54:53,541 --> 00:54:55,501
Then our Annie took half the night

926
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:59,046
to draw the seam
up the back of my legs with a pencil.

927
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,049
You couldn't understand why
you couldn't get your hands round them.

928
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:04,552
You thought it was magic.

929
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,220
It was magic.

930
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,309
When you've gray hair,
people think your heart never skipped.

931
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:13,478
Did yours ever skip?

932
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,939
Aye, it danced a bloody jig
every time you walked in the room.

933
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:20,651
You were full of it then
and you're full of it now.

934
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,695
Come on. We may get on.

935
00:55:24,572 --> 00:55:27,867
Ah, Jimmy said he'd drive me
to the hospital in the morning.

936
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:29,702
And I told him he would not.

937
00:55:31,787 --> 00:55:33,581
I'm taking you in on the bus.

938
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,626
I'm walking you in, and when they're done,

939
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:39,504
you can be bloody sure
I'm walking you back out again.

940
00:55:40,838 --> 00:55:43,716
You hear me? I'm walking you home.

941
00:55:44,759 --> 00:55:47,720
- Do you hear me?
- Yeah, I hear you, missus.

942
00:55:50,181 --> 00:55:52,141
Sure, when did I not?

943
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:10,368
Aldergrove bus going
in three minutes. Last tickets now.

944
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:13,329
The boss has been in touch.
They want me to stay on.

945
00:56:14,413 --> 00:56:16,457
A permanent job in England.

946
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,210
Wanting me to move into management.

947
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:20,670
It's more money.

948
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,631
There's a house that goes with it.

949
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:27,468
We get it rent-free,
with a chance to own it if things go well.

950
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:31,514
A wee bit bigger than what we have here,
a room for each of the boys.

951
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:32,682
There's a wee garden too.

952
00:56:32,765 --> 00:56:35,643
Are you allowed to play football
in that garden, Daddy?

953
00:56:35,726 --> 00:56:37,186
Aye, Son.

954
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:39,647
If I say yes,
there's more money straightaway.

955
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,899
We could start getting on top
of that back tax now.

956
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:46,487
This family's not gonna get another chance
like that in this town, not now.

957
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:50,116
Watch out for that traffic there.

958
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:53,077
I'm watching it now, Mammy. It's okay.

959
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,372
Come on, now. Two minutes.
Get on board if you're coming.

960
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,665
Last tickets now.

961
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:04,922
Sounds like they really want you.

962
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:10,803
What do you want?

963
00:57:13,681 --> 00:57:15,516
I want my family with me.

964
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:18,811
I want you.

965
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:28,112
You and me, we've known each other
since we were toddlers.

966
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:34,118
We've known this street
and every street round it all our lives...

967
00:57:35,911 --> 00:57:38,581
and every man, woman and child
that lives in every bloody house,

968
00:57:38,664 --> 00:57:40,124
whether we like it or not.

969
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,628
I like it.

970
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:48,257
And you say you have a
wee garden for them boys?

971
00:57:50,509 --> 00:57:54,013
But here they can play
wherever the hell they like,

972
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,434
because everybody knows them,
everybody likes them,

973
00:57:58,517 --> 00:58:00,478
and everybody looks after them.

974
00:58:02,355 --> 00:58:04,065
If we go over the water,

975
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,818
them people's not gonna understand
a word we say.

976
00:58:09,695 --> 00:58:10,780
And half of them,

977
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:14,283
they'll take the hand out of us
for sounding different.

978
00:58:15,284 --> 00:58:18,329
And the other half, they'll hate us,

979
00:58:19,664 --> 00:58:22,083
'cause men here are killing
their young sons on our streets.

980
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:24,126
They'll think we don't give a shite.

981
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:28,255
And you think they're gonna
welcome us with open arms?

982
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:31,050
What, and say, "Come on in.

983
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:33,344
Well done for stealing
the house off of us"?

984
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:36,639
Things change.

985
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:42,228
Aye, they do.

986
00:58:45,815 --> 00:58:47,775
We need to decide by Christmas.

987
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,654
You need to decide by Christmas.

988
00:58:53,656 --> 00:58:55,032
You're coming back,

989
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:57,201
aren't you, Daddy?

990
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,413
You look after your mummy.

991
00:59:01,414 --> 00:59:02,623
Be good.

992
00:59:03,374 --> 00:59:04,641
If you can't be good...

993
00:59:04,665 --> 00:59:06,919
And if you can't
be good, be careful.

994
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,965
Right, off we go.
Aldergrove Airport, ladies and gents.

995
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:28,607
We'll talk on the phone, okay?

996
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:33,779
Give me a ring.
Tell me when you've got there.

997
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,536
I caught you looking at Dr. Kildare.

998
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,581
You can talk.

999
01:00:26,457 --> 01:00:27,666
Have you wrote to Santa?

1000
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:30,628
He has, but Santa's explained
that money's a bit tight this year,

1001
01:00:30,711 --> 01:00:32,797
so he's not to expect too much.

1002
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:34,715
Sure, Santa has plenty of surplus

1003
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,967
if you talk to the people in the know.

1004
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,346
Your health is all you need
for a Christmas present.

1005
01:00:40,429 --> 01:00:43,224
You've the right one to keep you
cheerful here, haven't you, Pop?

1006
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:47,102
You tell your mammy to stop her cheek
or I'm not taking you to the show.

1007
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:48,771
- What show's that?
- I don't know.

1008
01:00:48,854 --> 01:00:51,232
I think there's Christmas
carols in it, though.

1009
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:53,025
That's my waterworks.

1010
01:00:53,108 --> 01:00:54,485
And you, behave yourself.

1011
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:55,736
Don't be annoying your pop.

1012
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,488
Don't be asking for
any Christmas presents.

1013
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:58,781
He's no money either.

1014
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,825
Taxman's got it, like ours.

1015
01:01:02,201 --> 01:01:06,622
Don't worry. Your mammy will persuade Santa
to bring some presents.

1016
01:01:06,705 --> 01:01:10,376
Don't think so, Pop.
I always know when there's no money.

1017
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,794
Hello?

1018
01:01:11,877 --> 01:01:13,879
- It's the rent man.
- I'll get it, Mam.

1019
01:01:13,963 --> 01:01:15,464
Shut your mouth.

1020
01:01:15,548 --> 01:01:17,174
Is your mum in there, wee man?

1021
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,468
Nobody's here...

1022
01:01:19,552 --> 01:01:21,178
{muffled shouting]

1023
01:01:21,262 --> 01:01:22,555
That puts me in mind

1024
01:01:22,638 --> 01:01:26,350
of a great wee system we had
in the old days for paying the rent.

1025
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,435
The rent man would come round

1026
01:01:28,519 --> 01:01:31,856
and collect the money
for every house in the whole street.

1027
01:01:31,939 --> 01:01:33,607
And once he had done

1028
01:01:33,691 --> 01:01:37,278
and all the rent books
were marked up to date,

1029
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:41,031
one of the boys would hold him up
at gunpoint in the back entry

1030
01:01:41,115 --> 01:01:43,325
and take all the money back off him.

1031
01:01:43,409 --> 01:01:47,830
And then he'd hand it straight back
to all the residents in the street,

1032
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:50,749
with a little commission for the service.

1033
01:01:50,833 --> 01:01:54,336
Yeah, it was a very effective system.

1034
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,964
And the rent man
was so good about it in the end

1035
01:01:57,047 --> 01:02:01,010
that eventually they cut him in
for a wee bit too and everybody was happy.

1036
01:02:01,886 --> 01:02:04,555
Except for the council, I suppose.

1037
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:07,516
His work's giving my da a house
in England now if he wants one.

1038
01:02:07,600 --> 01:02:09,768
It's got a garden and everything,

1039
01:02:09,852 --> 01:02:12,813
and two toilets,
and they're both inside the house.

1040
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:15,357
There's nothing wrong
with an outside toilet,

1041
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:16,859
except on an aeroplane.

1042
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:21,614
My ma says if we went across the water,

1043
01:02:21,697 --> 01:02:23,949
they wouldn't understand the way we talk.

1044
01:02:24,033 --> 01:02:25,409
That shouldn't be a problem, Son.

1045
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:27,202
I've been married to your granny
for 50 years,

1046
01:02:27,286 --> 01:02:29,496
I've never understood a word she's said.

1047
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:34,752
And if they can't understand you,
then they're not listening,

1048
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,670
and that's their problem.

1049
01:02:36,754 --> 01:02:40,382
You know, when I was in Leicester,
they said the same thing about me.

1050
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:45,054
So I put on a different bloody accent
every day just to annoy them.

1051
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:47,056
They never knew who I was.

1052
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:51,810
But I did, and that's the only one
who needs to know.

1053
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:55,022
You know who you are, don't you?

1054
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:56,607
Yes, Pop.

1055
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:59,652
You're Buddy from Belfast 15...

1056
01:03:01,236 --> 01:03:03,155
where everybody knows you.

1057
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:05,950
And your pop looks out for you,

1058
01:03:06,033 --> 01:03:08,911
and your mammy looks out for you,
your daddy looks out for you,

1059
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,538
your granny looks out for you,
your brother looks out for you,

1060
01:03:11,622 --> 01:03:15,334
and the whole family looks out for you.

1061
01:03:15,417 --> 01:03:20,297
And wherever you go
and whatever you become,

1062
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:22,341
that'll always be the truth.

1063
01:03:23,384 --> 01:03:25,344
And that thought'll keep you safe.

1064
01:03:25,970 --> 01:03:27,304
It'll keep you happy.

1065
01:03:29,390 --> 01:03:30,975
You remember that for me?

1066
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,559
- Yes, Pop.
- Aye.

1067
01:03:32,643 --> 01:03:34,103
Fine man you are.

1068
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:40,192
Now, forget about what your father
and your mother want.

1069
01:03:41,026 --> 01:03:42,319
What do you want?

1070
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,906
I want you and my granny to come too.

1071
01:04:05,134 --> 01:04:07,386
<i>Hear</i> me.

1072
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:10,139
Hear me.

1073
01:04:10,889 --> 01:04:13,851
I am here tonight to warn you

1074
01:04:13,934 --> 01:04:19,523
that you have yet a chance and hope
of escaping my fate.

1075
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,734
Who wears chains that size?

1076
01:04:21,817 --> 01:04:24,528
Granny, you're not allowed to talk
in the theater.

1077
01:04:24,611 --> 01:04:26,280
It makes one heck of a necklace.

1078
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:30,826
You were always a good friend to me.
Thank you.

1079
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:34,455
You will be haunted.

1080
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:41,128
Is this the chance and hope
you mentioned, Jacob?

1081
01:04:41,712 --> 01:04:43,047
It is.

1082
01:04:43,881 --> 01:04:45,257
I think I'd rather not.

1083
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,301
I'm bloody well sure you wouldn't.

1084
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:04,777
When will Pop get out of the hospital?

1085
01:05:05,652 --> 01:05:07,821
When the doctors say his lungs are fine.

1086
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:13,035
When Pop went to England to be
a coal miner, did you go with him?

1087
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,331
Did you want to?

1088
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,628
Neither do I.

1089
01:05:25,672 --> 01:05:27,674
Has your father
said what he's doing?

1090
01:05:29,593 --> 01:05:32,221
He says it has to get decided
by Christmas.

1091
01:05:33,514 --> 01:05:35,766
- When's he coming back?
- At the weekend.

1092
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,184
We're going to the pictures.

1093
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:39,937
<i>He's taking us to
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.</i>

1094
01:05:40,020 --> 01:05:42,439
- What in the name of God is that?
- It's a flying car.

1095
01:05:42,523 --> 01:05:44,316
Oh, God, I've heard it all.

1096
01:05:44,399 --> 01:05:47,111
It goes over a cliff
and you nearly fall out of your seat.

1097
01:05:47,194 --> 01:05:48,195
Do you wanna come?

1098
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,864
It'll be company for you
till my pop's home.

1099
01:05:50,948 --> 01:05:52,917
If God had wanted
me to see flying cars,

1100
01:05:52,941 --> 01:05:54,910
I'd have been born
with blinking wings.

1101
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,539
You love your films, don't you?

1102
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:03,544
I was a great one for the pictures
when I was your age.

1103
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:07,297
I used to think you could climb
right inside the screen

1104
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:09,842
and visit all those
strange places you saw.

1105
01:06:11,009 --> 01:06:13,220
Like that one in that
film, what was that?

1106
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,305
<i>Ah... Lost Horizon.</i>

1107
01:06:15,389 --> 01:06:16,598
Did you ever see that?

1108
01:06:16,682 --> 01:06:18,851
No. What was the name
of the place, Granny?

1109
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:24,439
Shangri-La. That's what they called it.

1110
01:06:24,523 --> 01:06:25,899
Did you ever go there?

1111
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:35,659
There were no roads to Shangri-La
from our part of Belfast.

1112
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,746
So will you go one day?

1113
01:06:57,347 --> 01:06:59,349
- <i>Where do they think they're going?</i>

1114
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:00,517
<i>Look out!</i>

1115
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,237
<i>What's happening?</i>

1116
01:07:12,321 --> 01:07:14,406
<i>Look! Look at that!</i>

1117
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:16,408
<i>It's fantastic!</i>

1118
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,492
<i>Oh!</i>

1119
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:20,287
<i>You're a genius!</i>

1120
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:22,706
<i>It's nothing, really.</i>

1121
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:37,346
Shut up. You'll get us thrown out.

1122
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:55,489
- Darling. Thank you.
- Look at this!

1123
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:02,621
Get Da, not me. Mummy.

1124
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,249
Don't shoot me. No, Buddy, don't. Hey!

1125
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,635
20-nil!

1126
01:08:26,853 --> 01:08:29,606
Ah, come on, here.
Sit down for a few minutes here.

1127
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:32,484
We've a wee word to have with you.

1128
01:08:35,070 --> 01:08:39,199
Buddy, Mum and I want to talk to you
about something,

1129
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:41,743
something that we might
have to do as a family.

1130
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,747
You know the way your
dad's over in England

1131
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:48,166
and he's been working over there
for quite a while?

1132
01:08:48,959 --> 01:08:51,753
Well, we were
thinking that, you know,

1133
01:08:51,837 --> 01:08:54,298
maybe we'd all go as a family
and go live there.

1134
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:57,759
And, um...

1135
01:08:57,843 --> 01:08:59,886
your dad's seen a really nice wee house,

1136
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,973
and it's got a lovely garden and...

1137
01:09:03,056 --> 01:09:05,267
- Play football, Buddy.
- Aye.

1138
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:07,936
There's loads of room there.
More room than we have here.

1139
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,314
- I don't wanna go to England!
- Switch that off.

1140
01:09:10,397 --> 01:09:12,566
I don't wanna go to England!

1141
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,067
It's all right, darling.

1142
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:16,528
I'll have no friends and no cousins

1143
01:09:16,611 --> 01:09:18,739
and I won't be able
to see Catherine at school.

1144
01:09:18,822 --> 01:09:20,157
Hey, listen, you'll make new friends,

1145
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:22,451
and you're gonna have this big garden
to play football in.

1146
01:09:22,534 --> 01:09:25,245
I don't care about the garden.
I want my granny and my pop,

1147
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,914
and I wanna do my project
on going to the moon

1148
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:30,667
and get on the first desk,
and I don't wanna have to talk funny,

1149
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,587
and I don't wanna forget what road
I have to go down when I'm dead.

1150
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:36,131
- No one's asking you to talk funny.
- No decision's been made yet.

1151
01:09:36,214 --> 01:09:38,842
We were just trying to see
what everyone thought first.

1152
01:09:38,925 --> 01:09:40,761
- You're just overtired.
- Exactly, yeah.

1153
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,555
I don't wanna leave Belfast!

1154
01:10:09,289 --> 01:10:12,959
Let's just leave it till Easter,
see where we are then.

1155
01:10:13,043 --> 01:10:14,127
Aye.

1156
01:10:14,795 --> 01:10:16,630
These boys are suffering.

1157
01:10:18,673 --> 01:10:20,634
I don't think we've got till Easter.

1158
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:26,640
I don't think you and me
have got till Easter either.

1159
01:10:32,062 --> 01:10:33,397
Well, come home.

1160
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:36,566
We'll fight this together.

1161
01:10:38,193 --> 01:10:41,696
Kids the same age as ours
are getting killed around the corner.

1162
01:10:44,282 --> 01:10:45,867
Well, we'll be careful.

1163
01:10:48,453 --> 01:10:50,580
You can't be with them 24 hours a day.

1164
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,251
You can't take away
their childhood either.

1165
01:11:04,219 --> 01:11:07,389
You know, whatever happens...

1166
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:12,352
what you've done with these two,

1167
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,188
it's phenomenal.

1168
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:20,527
What are you talking about?

1169
01:11:22,612 --> 01:11:23,864
You raised them.

1170
01:11:26,283 --> 01:11:27,492
Not me.

1171
01:11:28,452 --> 01:11:29,703
Not us.

1172
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:31,997
You.

1173
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,126
Thank you.

1174
01:11:40,005 --> 01:11:41,882
We'll see what happens by Easter.

1175
01:11:42,632 --> 01:11:46,052
I'll take the bins out, make a cuppa,
get these 'uns to bed.

1176
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:14,873
Back to bed.

1177
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,126
See you in two weeks.

1178
01:13:12,639 --> 01:13:15,141
Hey, you're gonna bring
the whole thing down.

1179
01:13:19,521 --> 01:13:20,981
<i>- ...five...
- ...six...</i>

1180
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:22,315
<i>- ...seven...
- ...eight...</i>

1181
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:25,610
<i>There used to be 40 houses here
in this mainly Roman Catholic street.</i>

1182
01:13:25,694 --> 01:13:28,071
<i>That was before the trouble
in the middle of August.</i>

1183
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,699
<i>Now the government are proposing
to rebuild this street,</i>

1184
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,867
<i>but there are increased tensions
in the city,</i>

1185
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:35,620
<i>and the move comes
amid warnings of renewed violence.</i>

1186
01:13:36,997 --> 01:13:40,333
Moondance at seven to two.
It has to win, don't you think?

1187
01:13:40,417 --> 01:13:44,296
- What's going on in your comic?
- Well, he has to defeat the monster.

1188
01:13:44,379 --> 01:13:47,549
- What... They're my chips!
- What's yours is mine

1189
01:13:47,632 --> 01:13:49,384
- and what's mine's my own.
- Granny says that.

1190
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:51,303
- What does that even mean?
- You'll find out.

1191
01:13:52,012 --> 01:13:53,471
Now, you go and wait at your granny's.

1192
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,890
I'll come and pick you up
after I've seen my father, okay, Son?

1193
01:13:55,974 --> 01:13:57,183
All right, Daddy.

1194
01:13:59,019 --> 01:14:01,730
Right, wee fella? You did well
for not grassing us to the police.

1195
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:03,273
- So you're in.
- What do you mean?

1196
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:05,191
You're one of us now, and this is it.

1197
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,527
- This is what?
- This is war.

1198
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,489
Let's go, boys. Let's do this.

1199
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,534
- What are we gonna do?
- Whatever the hell we want.

1200
01:14:14,618 --> 01:14:16,786
Our bloods up, lads. Our bloods up.

1201
01:14:17,495 --> 01:14:20,790
<i>Authorities are urging citizens
to return to their homes immediately...</i>

1202
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:21,958
Take what you want!

1203
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:24,377
<i>...and to stay inside
and off the streets until further notice.</i>

1204
01:14:24,461 --> 01:14:26,546
<i>- Come on, let's just get home.
- Effective immediately.</i>

1205
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:28,173
<i>They machine-gunned us.</i>

1206
01:14:28,256 --> 01:14:31,509
<i>Armored cars paving the way
for the hooligans to come in.</i>

1207
01:14:31,593 --> 01:14:32,886
Everybody home now.

1208
01:14:32,969 --> 01:14:35,263
This doesn't look good.
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

1209
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:40,185
I'm going home! I'm going home!

1210
01:14:40,268 --> 01:14:42,270
- No, you're not.
- I wanna go home!

1211
01:14:42,354 --> 01:14:44,898
- You're coming with us.
- I wanna go home.

1212
01:14:46,358 --> 01:14:47,734
Go on! Smash them!

1213
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,405
- Come on. Get in here!
- Get in. Go on!

1214
01:14:57,077 --> 01:14:59,371
Take it easy, man.
We don't want any trouble.

1215
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,290
- Oh, for God's sake, leave it.
- Come on. Let's go.

1216
01:15:02,374 --> 01:15:03,792
They've put the windows through.

1217
01:15:03,875 --> 01:15:06,002
This city belongs to the Protestants!

1218
01:15:06,086 --> 01:15:08,338
- Get yourself something.
- What?

1219
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,839
Whatever you need.

1220
01:15:09,923 --> 01:15:11,841
Hey, get back, you Fenian!

1221
01:15:12,676 --> 01:15:15,512
- We're taking control.
- Washing powder!

1222
01:15:15,595 --> 01:15:17,389
Lock the doors. Lock the doors.

1223
01:15:26,231 --> 01:15:27,607
Mammy! Mammy!

1224
01:15:27,691 --> 01:15:30,151
- Here, what the hell's going on?
- Mammy!

1225
01:15:30,235 --> 01:15:33,029
- We're looting the supermarket.
- Where did you get that?

1226
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:35,198
I told you, we're looting the supermarket.

1227
01:15:35,281 --> 01:15:38,034
You're what?
You wait right there, young man.

1228
01:15:42,997 --> 01:15:45,208
Why did you take that washing powder?

1229
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,835
It's biological.

1230
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:52,298
Oh, no. Get you now, get you now.

1231
01:15:55,427 --> 01:15:57,345
Here, grab everything you can.

1232
01:15:57,429 --> 01:15:58,722
Smash it in!

1233
01:15:58,805 --> 01:15:59,806
Come on.

1234
01:15:59,889 --> 01:16:01,516
Move! Move it!

1235
01:16:01,599 --> 01:16:03,601
Get the towel. Get the towel.

1236
01:16:03,685 --> 01:16:04,978
You watch yourselves.

1237
01:16:05,061 --> 01:16:07,188
- Clear the shelf!
- Take the lot of it.

1238
01:16:07,272 --> 01:16:10,567
Now, you put that back. Do you hear me?

1239
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:13,153
And if you ever, ever do anything
like that again,

1240
01:16:13,236 --> 01:16:14,904
I will kill you, do you hear me?

1241
01:16:14,988 --> 01:16:17,282
And you, young madam,
if you ever drag my son

1242
01:16:17,365 --> 01:16:20,410
into something like this again,
I will beat you black and blue

1243
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:22,746
until you never get home again,
do you hear me?

1244
01:16:23,455 --> 01:16:25,582
All right. Put it back, I said.

1245
01:16:25,665 --> 01:16:28,668
Hey, woman! We don't put things back.

1246
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:31,087
That's not the statement
we're trying to make.

1247
01:16:31,171 --> 01:16:33,298
Billy, come on.
The army are coming. Come on!

1248
01:16:33,381 --> 01:16:35,049
Out! Go on, get out!

1249
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,217
Come on. Grab it!

1250
01:16:36,301 --> 01:16:38,178
- Out!
- All right, all right.

1251
01:16:38,261 --> 01:16:39,637
- Come on.
- Come on!

1252
01:16:42,432 --> 01:16:45,351
<i>Clear the street Clear the street now.</i>

1253
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:48,021
<i>Tear gas and rubber bullets will be used.</i>

1254
01:16:48,563 --> 01:16:50,815
<i>We're clearing this area.
Move out the way now!</i>

1255
01:16:50,899 --> 01:16:53,026
- Time to get out of here.
- Don't try anything.

1256
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,904
So, you two are going to guarantee
safe passage for me and my men.

1257
01:16:55,987 --> 01:16:58,656
If you try to run,
I'll put a bullet in your son's head.

1258
01:17:05,747 --> 01:17:08,416
Ah, here he comes, the Lone Ranger.

1259
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:10,627
<i>Clear this area right now.</i>

1260
01:17:11,211 --> 01:17:13,505
I can see your kind
needs a little discipline!

1261
01:17:13,588 --> 01:17:15,381
- Come on!
- You let them go now.

1262
01:17:16,591 --> 01:17:20,470
No, I think if I do, one of them soldiers
is gonna take my head off.

1263
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:23,681
If they don't, I will.

1264
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,435
Over their dead bodies.

1265
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:37,153
Folks always have a problem with change.

1266
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:39,864
But you better get used to it, mister.

1267
01:17:39,948 --> 01:17:42,200
People like me run this town now.

1268
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:47,163
And it's people like you
that bring us all down.

1269
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,524
Daddy!

1270
01:18:52,979 --> 01:18:54,606
This isn't the end, pal!

1271
01:19:30,767 --> 01:19:31,768
Thanks.

1272
01:20:02,048 --> 01:20:03,341
It's gonna be all right.

1273
01:20:04,092 --> 01:20:07,512
I'll talk to the committee,
get this fixed.

1274
01:20:08,638 --> 01:20:10,181
There'll be no more bother.

1275
01:20:14,852 --> 01:20:17,605
I caught sight of my face
in that shop window

1276
01:20:19,440 --> 01:20:23,361
when I was running down the street
and dragging them poor kids behind me.

1277
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:29,325
And I was looking in the mirror just now...

1278
01:20:31,786 --> 01:20:33,496
at that same face.

1279
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,043
And I asked myself...

1280
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:43,715
what the hell am I doing?

1281
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:54,434
And then I was sick...

1282
01:20:57,478 --> 01:20:59,439
like I am every morning now.

1283
01:21:09,115 --> 01:21:10,450
And I realized...

1284
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:20,460
I don't think it really matters anymore.

1285
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,090
So, tomorrow...

1286
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:32,180
when Mack and Auntie Violet come round...

1287
01:21:37,393 --> 01:21:39,187
we're going to start packing.

1288
01:21:55,369 --> 01:21:56,788
You've no choice.

1289
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:01,000
You know they're gonna
come for you, don't you?

1290
01:22:02,126 --> 01:22:05,213
And this time,
they'll send somebody serious.

1291
01:22:07,757 --> 01:22:09,759
Get yourselves to the moon.

1292
01:22:13,554 --> 01:22:17,767
London's only one small step for a man.

1293
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:21,854
Belfast will still be here
when you get back.

1294
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,149
Will you?

1295
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,155
I'm going nowhere you won't find me.

1296
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:49,507
And now to announce
the winners of our school moon project...

1297
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,514
Well, how'd it go with this?

1298
01:22:56,597 --> 01:22:58,516
- We got a gold star.
- We got a gold star.

1299
01:22:58,599 --> 01:23:00,017
Ah! Good on youse.

1300
01:23:00,101 --> 01:23:03,479
Now, tell me this,
seeing as you two will know.

1301
01:23:03,563 --> 01:23:06,232
How do I get to the moon
with only ten pound,

1302
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:09,068
three leaky umbrellas and my bus pass?

1303
01:23:19,787 --> 01:23:23,124
See, there's an art to an Ulster fry, son.

1304
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:26,919
Mind you, I'm glad your Aunt Violet's
away up the stairs there with your ma.

1305
01:23:27,003 --> 01:23:29,505
She keeps banging on now
about how Northern Ireland's

1306
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:32,842
got the highest rates
of "chlomestremol" in the world.

1307
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:36,012
Sure, I think it's great
that we're world champions at something.

1308
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:40,266
Do you mind answering that for me, son,
while I've got this hot pan on?

1309
01:23:42,685 --> 01:23:44,645
Is your mother in, son?

1310
01:23:50,818 --> 01:23:52,570
Watch yourself, missus!

1311
01:23:52,653 --> 01:23:54,947
- Where's your white stick?
- Are you all right, son?

1312
01:23:55,031 --> 01:23:57,033
Will you ask in there
for my daddy, please?

1313
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:58,326
Point out who he is.

1314
01:23:58,409 --> 01:24:00,912
The farmer says, "No,"
and he goes, "But do you have any bread?"

1315
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:06,042
Excuse me. Your little lad's here.

1316
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,501
What's that?

1317
01:24:39,325 --> 01:24:41,327
- He was a great fella.
- Heart breaks for them.

1318
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,246
It was good to see him one last time.

1319
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:44,372
There.

1320
01:24:54,465 --> 01:24:55,883
Oh, I'm done.

1321
01:24:56,634 --> 01:24:59,220
Here, you're all right. Will!

1322
01:25:00,429 --> 01:25:01,764
- You're all right.
- Yeah.

1323
01:25:01,847 --> 01:25:04,642
Take that note up to Mrs. Hewitt
and get the wee message for your granny.

1324
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:05,768
For her nerves.

1325
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:06,852
Come on.

1326
01:25:21,117 --> 01:25:23,828
That was a lot of people
that came to see him today.

1327
01:25:24,620 --> 01:25:27,415
Aye. He was very popular.

1328
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,834
And he owed half of them money.

1329
01:25:34,547 --> 01:25:36,674
He used to help me with my maths.

1330
01:25:45,516 --> 01:25:47,226
He was a very deep thinker.

1331
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,063
A very deep thinker.

1332
01:25:52,356 --> 01:25:53,941
Did he help you?

1333
01:25:58,738 --> 01:25:59,739
Yeah.

1334
01:26:01,657 --> 01:26:03,034
Yeah, he did help me.

1335
01:26:04,994 --> 01:26:06,454
He helped me a lot.

1336
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,669
<i>"For now we see through a glass, darkly,</i>

1337
01:26:14,253 --> 01:26:18,215
For now I know in part,

1338
01:26:18,299 --> 01:26:22,261
but then I shall know as also I am known.

1339
01:26:23,137 --> 01:26:26,766
For when I was a child,
I spake as a child,

1340
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:30,519
I understood as a child,
I thought as a child:

1341
01:26:32,021 --> 01:26:35,399
but then I became a man
and I put away childish things."

1342
01:26:36,901 --> 01:26:40,863
So do not say in grief
that you are sorry he is gone,

1343
01:26:42,698 --> 01:26:46,494
but rather say in thankfulness

1344
01:26:46,577 --> 01:26:49,497
you are grateful he was here.

1345
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:59,924
- God love him.
- And that wee dote.

1346
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:02,259
I'll miss him, now. I'll miss him.

1347
01:27:02,343 --> 01:27:04,095
And we'll be sure to toast him
down the club.

1348
01:27:04,178 --> 01:27:05,429
Will we head down now, will we?

1349
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:08,307
I'm sure your man'|| have
a wee sing-along with the jukebox.

1350
01:28:55,623 --> 01:28:57,583
Top of the world, Ma!

1351
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,585
Top of the world!

1352
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,079
Buddy. Follow me.

1353
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:46,048
- Hi, Buddy.
- Hello.

1354
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,060
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

1355
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:03,607
- I'll come back.
- Make sure you do.

1356
01:30:06,443 --> 01:30:08,028
- Cheerio.
- Cheerio.

1357
01:30:18,706 --> 01:30:22,960
Daddy, do you think
me and that wee girl have a future?

1358
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,920
Well, why the heck not?

1359
01:30:25,004 --> 01:30:26,964
You know she's a Catholic?

1360
01:30:33,345 --> 01:30:36,473
That wee girl can be a practicing Hindu

1361
01:30:36,557 --> 01:30:40,102
or a Southern Baptist
or a vegetarian Antichrist,

1362
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:44,315
but if she's kind and she's fair

1363
01:30:44,398 --> 01:30:46,358
and you two respect each other,

1364
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:51,113
she and her people are welcome
in our house any day of the week.

1365
01:30:51,196 --> 01:30:52,197
Agreed?

1366
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:59,455
Mind you, does that mean you and me
have to start going to confession?

1367
01:30:59,538 --> 01:31:01,206
Probably.

1368
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,875
That's us two in trouble, then.

1369
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,333
Go.

1370
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:47,795
Go now.

1371
01:31:51,173 --> 01:31:52,508
Don't look back.

1372
01:31:56,261 --> 01:31:57,638
I love you, Son.
