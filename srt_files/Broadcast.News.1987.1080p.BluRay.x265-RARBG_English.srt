1
00:00:51,313 --> 00:00:54,234
I don't know a recent
Saturday I've sold more

2
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:58,954
Why so glum?

3
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:02,075
Were you bothering by
those waitresses making a fuss?

4
00:01:02,675 --> 00:01:03,875
No.

5
00:01:04,756 --> 00:01:08,036
But, honest. What are you supposed to say
when they keep talking about your looks?

6
00:01:08,156 --> 00:01:11,077
I don't even know what they mean
"Beat them off with a stick. "

7
00:01:12,517 --> 00:01:13,837
if that's your only problem

8
00:01:14,437 --> 00:01:15,878
It's not

9
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:20,599
I got my report card

10
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,920
Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.

11
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,161
I see you studying so hard, Tom.
What do you think the problem is?

12
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:39,562
I'll just have to try harder.
I don't know.

13
00:01:39,842 --> 00:01:45,123
I will. I will. I will.

14
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:46,123
I will...

15
00:01:51,964 --> 00:01:55,205
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.

16
00:01:55,245 --> 00:01:59,526
Will you sign it, please?

17
00:02:06,247 --> 00:02:07,927
Would it help if I got you a tutor?

18
00:02:10,728 --> 00:02:12,128
That would be great

19
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,529
It better help

20
00:02:14,889 --> 00:02:18,889
What can you do with yourself
if all you do is look good?

21
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,611
I'm frequently asked
what the special difficulties...

22
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:27,011
...are in being graduated from High School...

23
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,371
two months shy of my fifteenth birthday.

24
00:02:29,852 --> 00:02:33,892
I sometimes think it was the difficulties
themselves which enabled me to do it.

25
00:02:34,372 --> 00:02:37,413
If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated...

26
00:02:37,773 --> 00:02:39,653
...I wouldn't have been in
such a hurry to graduate.

27
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,774
I hope the next student
who comes along and is able to excel...

28
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:47,015
...isn't made to feel so much an outcast.

29
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,335
But, I'm looking forward to college;

30
00:02:49,575 --> 00:02:53,656
...and this is the happiest day
I've had in a long time.

31
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:58,817
So, I thank you and I forgive you.

32
00:03:02,978 --> 00:03:04,658
Go ahead, Stephen. Take your last licks.

33
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:06,498
But this will heal

34
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:11,059
what I'm going to say to you
will scar you forever.

35
00:03:11,499 --> 00:03:12,900
Ready? Here it is.

36
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,341
You'll never make more than
nineteen thousand dollars a year.

37
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:31,383
Okay, what about this:

38
00:03:31,823 --> 00:03:35,744
You'll never leave South Boston
and I'm going to see the whole damn world.

39
00:03:36,344 --> 00:03:39,265
You'll never know the pleasure
of writing a graceful sentence...

40
00:03:39,545 --> 00:03:41,265
...or having an original thought.

41
00:03:41,745 --> 00:03:42,945
Think about it.

42
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:47,346
Nineteen thousand dollars...
Not bad.

43
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,427
Dear Felatzia,

44
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:54,267
...it's truly amazing to me...

45
00:03:54,948 --> 00:03:59,348
...that we live a world apart
and yet have the same favorite music.

46
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,869
I loved the picture you sent...

47
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,310
and have it up on my bulletin board.
You're growing...

48
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,030
Honey?

49
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,311
Oh God

50
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:16,232
Daddy. Don't ever do that to me.

51
00:04:16,872 --> 00:04:19,232
Look, it's time for you to go to sleep.

52
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:21,953
I just have two more pen pals
and then I'm done.

53
00:04:23,353 --> 00:04:26,394
Finish quickly. I don't want you
getting obsessive about these things.

54
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,074
Good night.

55
00:04:38,356 --> 00:04:42,877
Dad, you want me to choose
my words so carefully...

56
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,117
...and then you just throw
a word like'obsessive' at me.

57
00:04:45,357 --> 00:04:48,598
Now, unless I'm wrong
please correct me if I am,

58
00:04:48,718 --> 00:04:51,398
...obsession is practically
a psychiatric term...

59
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:55,879
concerning people who don't have anything
else but the object of their obsession...

60
00:04:56,239 --> 00:04:57,999
...who can't stop and do anything else.

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,320
Well, Here I am stopping to tell you this.
Okay?

62
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:05,321
So would you please try and
be a little more precise...

63
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:08,962
instead of calling a person
something like'obsessive'

64
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:12,962
Good night.

65
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:04,732
Hi. It's me.

66
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:07,012
It's thirty minutes
before you have to meet me in the lobby...

67
00:06:07,813 --> 00:06:09,173
...nudge your mate.

68
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,053
I don't think it's time to eat...

69
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:14,134
...but there's a cafeteria
at the bus depot once we get down there.

70
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:16,294
I love working with you two.

71
00:06:16,814 --> 00:06:18,375
It saves me a call.

72
00:06:25,296 --> 00:06:27,576
Hi. Turn on your TV...

73
00:06:27,616 --> 00:06:31,057
Arnold Schwarzenegger on the today's show
Good Morning America and the Morning News...

74
00:06:31,097 --> 00:06:33,057
...and I think he's live on
at least two of them.

75
00:06:33,457 --> 00:06:36,618
At 6 o'clock on the wake-up news
they used the wrong missile graphic.

76
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:40,539
And they call me this morning to say...

77
00:06:40,579 --> 00:06:44,620
Now listen, Arnold just said that
he's been making three million a movie now.

78
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,460
But he's not ever gonna change.

79
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,700
He's still the same person when
he was making two million dollars a movie.

80
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,061
He feels no different.

81
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:55,342
He also bought a brand-new condo with Maria,
they gonna furnish tastefully.

82
00:06:57,982 --> 00:06:59,182
A half hour in the lobby.

83
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:01,423
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies.

84
00:08:15,797 --> 00:08:16,677
There he is.

85
00:08:16,957 --> 00:08:18,397
Hi.

86
00:08:18,997 --> 00:08:20,198
I'd like to talk to you for a second.

87
00:08:23,118 --> 00:08:24,118
Just a few questions?

88
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,238
No.

89
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,399
We came from Washington.

90
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,199
Move away from me.

91
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,481
Last week he was...

92
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,721
Ok No. Watch this.
I want you to watch this.

93
00:08:42,042 --> 00:08:47,243
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuckes. Snot...
Fuckee.

94
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:48,283
You want to use that?

95
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:50,763
It depends on how big a news day it is.

96
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:52,204
Thanks.

97
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:54,044
I can't believe he said that.

98
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:55,404
Very proud of

99
00:08:56,324 --> 00:08:57,725
He really...

100
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,807
You should work on your speech.

101
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,407
No.

102
00:09:12,207 --> 00:09:15,128
It makes me nervous to think about it.
Let's do this.

103
00:09:19,289 --> 00:09:22,929
We are being increasingly influenced
by the star system.

104
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:27,570
The network anchormen are so powerful
they compromise our last best hope.

105
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,411
Our profession is in danger.

106
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:37,092
The current group is clearly qualified,

107
00:09:37,572 --> 00:09:40,733
...tied still to our best traditions, but...

108
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:43,013
...who follows these men?

109
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,254
Excuse me.

110
00:09:45,774 --> 00:09:47,294
We are being pressured...

111
00:09:47,454 --> 00:09:49,014
detect a loyalty...

112
00:09:50,615 --> 00:09:52,895
Oh, I've known so many women like that.

113
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,495
They don't like their looks
so they're angry.

114
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:56,816
Excuse me.

115
00:09:57,216 --> 00:09:58,496
Sure.

116
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:05,577
All of you know what I'm talking about.

117
00:10:05,657 --> 00:10:07,978
We're all trying to act together
than we are.

118
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:09,978
But we care.

119
00:10:10,258 --> 00:10:15,939
So, we're all secretly terrified,
aren't we?

120
00:10:26,861 --> 00:10:29,502
I was going to talk about other trends
but...

121
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:32,582
...the magazine shows, news at profit,

122
00:10:32,743 --> 00:10:36,623
...the historic influence of
Entertainment Tonight,

123
00:10:36,663 --> 00:10:40,264
...the danger, the hope,
the dream, the question...

124
00:10:40,784 --> 00:10:43,625
Oh,
I was going to show you a tape.

125
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:47,705
a story that was carried by
all networks on the same night

126
00:10:47,745 --> 00:10:50,066
...the same night that not one...

127
00:10:50,106 --> 00:10:55,427
network noted a major policy change in
Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...

128
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,707
Here's what they ran instead...

129
00:10:58,027 --> 00:10:59,748
Go ahead please.
Show the tape.

130
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:28,393
I know it's good film.
I know it's fun. I like fun.

131
00:11:28,793 --> 00:11:30,793
It's just not news.

132
00:11:38,235 --> 00:11:39,595
Well, you're lucky you love it.

133
00:11:39,635 --> 00:11:42,716
you're going to get a lot more just like it.

134
00:11:43,116 --> 00:11:44,676
Good.

135
00:11:51,037 --> 00:11:52,718
Thank you

136
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,360
I dont think to be any q and a

137
00:12:29,404 --> 00:12:30,885
Hi.

138
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:33,365
Hello.

139
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:45,968
I just wanted to tell you
how great you were.

140
00:12:47,048 --> 00:12:48,888
My name's Tom Grunick.

141
00:12:54,009 --> 00:12:55,609
Thank you

142
00:13:07,932 --> 00:13:09,572
They hated me.

143
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:12,973
I don't hate them.

144
00:13:13,013 --> 00:13:18,574
They say if you can reach even one person,
it means something...

145
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:21,374
And you did that.

146
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,495
Would you like to have dinner with me?

147
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:30,576
Sure

148
00:13:33,056 --> 00:13:35,697
Another thing I can't stand
Is this dull?

149
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:38,618
no. No. No.

150
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:41,098
Another thing I can't stand is...

151
00:13:41,138 --> 00:13:44,539
...when White House reporters bullshit
with each other after a briefing...

152
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,579
...and then one of them has a theory...

153
00:13:46,939 --> 00:13:49,900
...and the other quotes it in his story as...

154
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,620
..."White House" sources say...

155
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,380
That actually goes on.

156
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,380
Yes.

157
00:13:54,861 --> 00:13:56,461
I am not tired.

158
00:13:56,581 --> 00:13:58,581
My room is down here.
Do you want to keep talking?

159
00:13:58,621 --> 00:14:00,222
Yes, sure.

160
00:14:05,022 --> 00:14:06,463
Come on.

161
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,784
Even I'm not that hard on myself.

162
00:14:10,824 --> 00:14:12,184
No, really.

163
00:14:14,024 --> 00:14:17,065
I got this job on a fluke...

164
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,825
...and wait till you hear where it ends up.

165
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:24,146
I was doing sports at the station.

166
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:29,787
The newspaper ran this untrue story
that I was leaving...

167
00:14:30,627 --> 00:14:33,788
...and they got all these
tons of protest mail.

168
00:14:34,388 --> 00:14:35,708
So.

169
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,389
So they made me anchor.

170
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,149
So great, right?

171
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:45,710
Except I'm no good at
what I'm being a success at.

172
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:49,391
How are you at back rubs?

173
00:15:06,154 --> 00:15:08,114
It's sort of normal the way you feel.

174
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:10,875
In graduate school
everyone thought the only mistake...

175
00:15:10,915 --> 00:15:12,915
...the admission committee made was
letting them in.

176
00:15:12,955 --> 00:15:15,236
Listen to me.
You keep on thinking I'm somebody who...

177
00:15:17,236 --> 00:15:18,756
...who lacks confidence.
That's not it.

178
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,437
I know I can talk well enough...

179
00:15:20,477 --> 00:15:21,717
...and I'm not bad at
making contact with people,

180
00:15:21,757 --> 00:15:26,198
...but I don't like the feeling that
I'm pretending to be a reporter.

181
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:28,558
And half the time I don't get the unders...

182
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:32,719
...the news I'm talking about.

183
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:37,080
It isn't that I'm down on myself.
Trust me,

184
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
I stink.

185
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,081
I trust you.

186
00:15:42,241 --> 00:15:45,201
I didn't even have the chance
to get really good at sports.

187
00:15:45,921 --> 00:15:47,162
I wasn't bad.

188
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:49,322
What about the obvious remedy?

189
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:53,243
Reversing things.
Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.

190
00:15:54,723 --> 00:15:56,243
I don't write.

191
00:15:59,644 --> 00:16:02,845
But that didn't stop me from
sending out audition tapes to the...

192
00:16:03,565 --> 00:16:05,885
...bigger stations and the networks.

193
00:16:06,605 --> 00:16:08,806
Well, come on.

194
00:16:08,886 --> 00:16:12,887
it is your life.
Nobody is tying you to the fast track.

195
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:19,408
Did you go to college?

196
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:24,449
So, you're not well educated and
you have almost no experience...

197
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:25,889
and you can't write.

198
00:16:26,249 --> 00:16:27,689
Yeah. And I'm...

199
00:16:27,729 --> 00:16:29,850
And I'm making a fortune.

200
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:37,691
It's hard...

201
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:38,931
...for me to advise you...

202
00:16:38,971 --> 00:16:43,372
...since you personify something
that I truly think is dangerous.

203
00:16:45,373 --> 00:16:46,893
I agree with you. You're not qualified.

204
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:49,413
So get qualified.
You can insist on being better prepared.

205
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:51,254
You don't have to just leave it with...

206
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,615
'I don't write. I'm not schooled...

207
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,655
...I don't understand the news I'm reading...

208
00:16:57,695 --> 00:17:00,456
...But at least I'm upset about it, folks. '

209
00:17:02,696 --> 00:17:04,216
Whoa.

210
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:07,257
Just what do you want from me, anyway?
Permission to be a fake?

211
00:17:07,617 --> 00:17:08,977
Stop whining...

212
00:17:09,657 --> 00:17:12,098
...do something about it.

213
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,900
Well, you don't have to start right now.

214
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,301
I hated the way you talked to me just now...

215
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,462
...and it wasn't just because
you were right.

216
00:17:44,384 --> 00:17:47,264
Oh God.

217
00:17:59,907 --> 00:18:01,987
No.

218
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,747
It wasn't just the speech...

219
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:05,428
...the same thing happened with this guy.

220
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:09,108
I have passed some line some place.

221
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:13,349
I am beginning to repel people
I'm trying to seduce.

222
00:18:13,629 --> 00:18:15,350
He must have been great-looking, right?

223
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:16,430
Why do you say that?

224
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,071
Because nobody invites a bad-looking idiot
to their bedroom.

225
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:22,831
Okay. Let's do me.

226
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:24,151
Sure.

227
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,832
I feel like I'm slipping...

228
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:28,832
...but do people who are actually
slipping feel that way...

229
00:18:28,872 --> 00:18:31,513
...or is it always the really good people
who are moving up...

230
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:35,954
...who invariably think they're slipping
because their standards are so high?

231
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:39,794
This conversation is not worthy of you.

232
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:41,315
I'd give anything if that were true.

233
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:42,795
Good night.

234
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:47,356
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity
and desperation made us more attractive?

235
00:18:47,396 --> 00:18:49,476
If needy were a turn-on?

236
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,716
Call if you get weird.

237
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:54,357
Take care.

238
00:18:54,397 --> 00:18:55,877
I will.

239
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:08,640
I was just thinking it was the
shortest phone conversation we ever had.

240
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,720
I never told you the reason
I was telling you everything for.

241
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,361
Hey?

242
00:19:16,201 --> 00:19:17,721
Those audition tapes I sent out...

243
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:20,882
I've been hired by your network
for the Washington bureau.

244
00:19:21,082 --> 00:19:23,402
So I'll probably see you at work.

245
00:19:23,442 --> 00:19:25,043
What?

246
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,483
Sorry.

247
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:33,684
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
the Times and he had a great audition tape.

248
00:19:33,724 --> 00:19:35,845
You want to start going over
who they could have gotten?

249
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,365
They can't take on people like this
for network news.

250
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:41,486
For God's sake. What's going on?

251
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:12,932
Okay, what about this?

252
00:20:13,172 --> 00:20:14,612
Here's a tough ethical one.

253
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:19,853
Would you tell a source that you loved them
just to get some information?

254
00:20:20,173 --> 00:20:22,894
Yes. Yes. Me too. Sure. You bet.

255
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:25,654
Jennifer didn't know
there was an alternative.

256
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,455
Here's a good one.

257
00:20:30,135 --> 00:20:33,496
They allow us to have cameras
at an execution in Florida.

258
00:20:33,536 --> 00:20:37,416
Do you broadcast tape of the guy
in the chair when they turn on the voltage?

259
00:20:37,456 --> 00:20:38,217
Sure.
Why not?

260
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:40,657
Absolutely.
You bet.

261
00:20:40,777 --> 00:20:43,658
Nothing like wrestling
with a moral dilemma is there?

262
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:46,058
yeah. Yeah.
Speak to you later.

263
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:48,418
Ok Bobby. Go back to 9-40, 5-40

264
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:53,139
We could...

265
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:55,340
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

266
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,504
They said I should observe the...

267
00:21:17,824 --> 00:21:19,024
They said it would be okay if...

268
00:21:19,064 --> 00:21:21,785
We're working here!
You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...

269
00:21:21,825 --> 00:21:23,345
Play back the last line...

270
00:21:23,705 --> 00:21:24,945
Thanks.
Bobby?

271
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:26,906
He said something about...
Let me hear it!

272
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,107
Jane.

273
00:21:32,307 --> 00:21:35,307
We'll need it in 14 minutes.
We're putting it directly into the...

274
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:37,428
Jane, Craig, just a second.
Let me hear it!

275
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:46,909
It's been a long time
since I've seen my folks and all but...

276
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,110
...I don't expect any big-deal homecoming.

277
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,310
Stop there.

278
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,591
I want to shoot the home-coming
from a book I have in the office.

279
00:21:55,631 --> 00:21:58,712
You don't have time. Not a chance.
I'll be right down. It's right tight.

280
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,912
I've got to tell Ernie...
because there isn't enough time.

281
00:22:02,953 --> 00:22:04,273
Yes, there is.

282
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,993
I don't think she's going to make it.

283
00:22:16,595 --> 00:22:19,116
Okay, Bobbie,
just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.

284
00:22:19,916 --> 00:22:22,076
Should I...
Just a two-second dissolve.

285
00:22:28,117 --> 00:22:31,558
Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
Why do you do this to me.

286
00:22:31,838 --> 00:22:33,558
Is it because I won an award?

287
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:37,119
Home coming...
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait.

288
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,280
The return of a fighting man has always been
one of the more moving ceremonies of war...

289
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,840
We have a minute and a half.

290
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,881
It's my responsibility
to tell them we won't be ready.

291
00:22:47,961 --> 00:22:48,961
Uh-uh. We're be ready.

292
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:50,281
In 84 seconds?

293
00:22:51,442 --> 00:22:52,322
Oh, God.

294
00:22:52,562 --> 00:22:53,442
You're saying'Oh, God...

295
00:22:54,762 --> 00:22:56,563
They are going to go to up
and the screen will be black...

296
00:22:56,603 --> 00:22:58,523
...they're going to go to black
because we're not there.

297
00:22:58,763 --> 00:23:02,404
How about careers, huh?
We're not going to make it.

298
00:23:02,444 --> 00:23:03,604
Whoops.

299
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:12,926
We got it.

300
00:23:47,652 --> 00:23:48,852
No there she is.

301
00:23:48,892 --> 00:23:49,653
Ok, stand by.

302
00:24:03,455 --> 00:24:07,096
Home coming.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait

303
00:24:07,576 --> 00:24:12,737
The return of a fighting man has always been
one of the more moving ceremonies of war...

304
00:24:12,777 --> 00:24:16,378
Tearful women, proud men, excited children.

305
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:22,499
But J.D. Singer was right
his homecoming was no big deal.

306
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:24,819
Aaron Altman

307
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,700
An american comes home.

308
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:34,101
That's your news. I'm Bill Rorich.
Good evening.

309
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,141
Look at that smile.

310
00:24:37,662 --> 00:24:39,342
That was good work.

311
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,343
Bill smiled. He liked it.

312
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,663
No, Bill loved it. That's a big smile.

313
00:24:43,703 --> 00:24:47,263
I haven't seen Bill smile
like that in weeks.

314
00:24:47,824 --> 00:24:50,384
Good piece.
Thanks Ernie.

315
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,744
I'm gonna see it again. Ernie?

316
00:24:57,945 --> 00:24:59,426
He did smile.

317
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,066
Don't tell anyone I do this.

318
00:25:06,307 --> 00:25:12,268
I'm sorry if I was in the way.
It was totally impressive. Great piece.

319
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:14,349
You weren't. Thanks.

320
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:16,229
How does it feel being here?

321
00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:17,589
I can't believe I'm really here.

322
00:25:17,629 --> 00:25:20,590
Do you know where Martin went?
I think he went downstairs. -Ok, thanks.

323
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,350
I can't believe I'm really here.

324
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:24,310
No I'm wrong.
He went to research.

325
00:25:26,671 --> 00:25:28,151
I can't believe I'm really here.

326
00:25:29,191 --> 00:25:30,832
No kidding.
If you're through work now...

327
00:25:30,872 --> 00:25:36,633
No. Aaron and I go to Central America
on Wednesday so I'm cramming.

328
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,313
I thought you were incredible in there.

329
00:25:40,553 --> 00:25:41,914
Everybody was.

330
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:47,915
I know how much I have to learn.
I'd really a lot appreciate it... if...

331
00:25:48,155 --> 00:25:50,835
'Really a lot appreciate it... '

332
00:25:53,396 --> 00:25:54,796
You make me nervous.

333
00:25:57,437 --> 00:25:59,677
Anyway

334
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:03,358
if I can pick your brain...

335
00:26:06,878 --> 00:26:10,519
I can't help you, sorry.
I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.

336
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,201
And it has nothing to do with the fact
I left your room instead of staying there?

337
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:35,604
Please.

338
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:42,285
You're gonna have to understand something.

339
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:44,646
This isn't personal.

340
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:48,486
Ok.

341
00:26:53,847 --> 00:26:56,008
Good night.
Good night.

342
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:24,653
Really? Well I'm sure you speak
English very well too. Thank you.

343
00:27:25,893 --> 00:27:26,934
Ready for this?

344
00:27:27,414 --> 00:27:29,654
He says they've been engaging
the Sandinistas pretty regularly...

345
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:32,215
...and he thinks there's gonna
be a shooting tonight.

346
00:27:36,975 --> 00:27:37,976
Look at her.

347
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,216
If anything happens to me...

348
00:27:40,256 --> 00:27:42,817
...you tell every woman I've ever dated
I was talking about them at the end.

349
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:45,617
That way they'll have to reevaluate me.

350
00:27:51,538 --> 00:27:52,298
Put on the boot.

351
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:57,019
No. No. What the hell are... No.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

352
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,500
We are not here to stage the news.
Wait and see what he does.

353
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,860
Sir, you do whatever you want.

354
00:28:04,781 --> 00:28:06,621
It's your choice.

355
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,263
Okay.

356
00:28:23,984 --> 00:28:26,505
He just said he scared.

357
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:49,149
The first shots were fired
not ten seconds ago.

358
00:28:51,589 --> 00:28:53,310
The Contras feel they must be outnumbered...

359
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:55,310
...this is so small a unit: that's a given.

360
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,751
Still they manage to hold their ground...

361
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:00,391
despite the fact that their
weapons have been acting up...

362
00:29:00,871 --> 00:29:03,112
...by the misfiring or jamming.

363
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:06,512
No new shipment of arms
is expected until tomorrow...

364
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:09,833
...all they got today were the shoes.

365
00:29:11,393 --> 00:29:13,514
Great line at the end.

366
00:29:13,554 --> 00:29:15,074
Did you shoot their boots?
Yeah. Of course.

367
00:29:15,114 --> 00:29:16,434
We can cut back at the end, right?

368
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:18,074
To the pan of the supplies boxes...

369
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:23,035
I can't believe I just risked my life for a
network that tests my face with focus groups

370
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,076
I don't feel good.

371
00:29:53,881 --> 00:29:58,042
x

372
00:30:00,042 --> 00:30:03,083
Hi.
How's it going?

373
00:30:05,363 --> 00:30:08,244
...chosen by the military command.

374
00:30:08,324 --> 00:30:12,325
A fire fight along the Nikaraguan border...
when we return.

375
00:30:15,965 --> 00:30:19,846
First shots were fired not ten seconds ago...
Freeze.

376
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:24,927
Congratulations you two.

377
00:30:25,607 --> 00:30:27,408
x

378
00:30:35,929 --> 00:30:39,250
There's a guy downstairs
clerks brought in and vouches for.

379
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,731
He says he has something to say about
gays getting promotions at State...

380
00:30:44,331 --> 00:30:46,731
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

381
00:30:47,171 --> 00:30:50,292
I just got back.
I don't know which end is up.

382
00:30:50,732 --> 00:30:52,452
Okay

383
00:30:53,012 --> 00:30:57,773
Jane! Bill Rorish wants to speak
to you at the break, now.

384
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:02,694
I never heard of him handing over
compliments in the middle of the show.

385
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,575
Jane?
Yes?

386
00:31:05,095 --> 00:31:06,855
Darling,
if it gets any better than that,

387
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:09,375
...I'm going to have to bring
you up here to New York.

388
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:13,616
Thanks.
I just wish you'd kept the first 20 seconds.

389
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,857
But thank you.

390
00:31:16,017 --> 00:31:20,818
Well, the visual with the boots at the end
was just perfect.

391
00:31:20,858 --> 00:31:22,578
God, he loved the boots.

392
00:31:22,618 --> 00:31:25,899
Aaron should be hearing this
so I have an extra witness.

393
00:31:26,299 --> 00:31:29,459
Well, you always want to give
the credit away, do you?

394
00:31:30,659 --> 00:31:34,180
No, I don't. He happens to deserve
the credit. He's right here.

395
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,741
I'll speak to you soon.

396
00:31:39,341 --> 00:31:41,501
He had to read over some new copy.

397
00:31:52,103 --> 00:31:53,584
What?

398
00:31:56,544 --> 00:31:59,625
Okay if I watch you tape
that interview downstairs?

399
00:31:59,665 --> 00:32:01,385
Yes.
Thanks.

400
00:32:06,026 --> 00:32:09,587
Laugh so they think I'm not dying
inside but have so much style...

401
00:32:09,627 --> 00:32:12,307
...I just said something funny.

402
00:32:15,588 --> 00:32:17,588
What did he say?

403
00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:21,309
I'll never tell.

404
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:27,350
x

405
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,471
He's never gonna forget it.
This way.

406
00:32:32,271 --> 00:32:35,472
Ok. I'm with...
Right.

407
00:32:36,192 --> 00:32:39,392
Could you give me that adress
one more time. Alright.

408
00:32:40,913 --> 00:32:43,713
Yeah.
It's good to finally beginning to work.

409
00:32:45,514 --> 00:32:49,354
17204 color red or...

410
00:32:49,394 --> 00:32:51,675
Yeah. 17204.

411
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:57,356
Got it. 17204

412
00:32:57,396 --> 00:32:59,076
Yeah, right.

413
00:33:08,038 --> 00:33:10,398
Jane! Got a story.

414
00:33:23,561 --> 00:33:27,681
Hi, how are you?
Wait. I need you.

415
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:34,163
I got a story.

416
00:33:34,203 --> 00:33:37,123
Some public official skipped a week
on his Christmas Club?

417
00:33:37,763 --> 00:33:40,204
The House Armed Service Committee
has a secret report which says that...

418
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:45,405
the General Stillwell tank the Army
has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.

419
00:33:45,645 --> 00:33:47,725
I got it cold, confirmed.

420
00:33:48,605 --> 00:33:52,126
They have 5 million dollars
in this thing already. -Billion.

421
00:33:53,126 --> 00:33:55,207
Right, billion... ok, of course.

422
00:33:55,487 --> 00:34:00,728
They said I could have any producer I wanted
and I want you.

423
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:06,369
One source referred to it as a
5 billion dollar metal sculpture...

424
00:34:06,409 --> 00:34:09,289
...too ugly to look at and too big to bury.

425
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:15,771
Did you write this?

426
00:34:15,811 --> 00:34:19,011
I write for you sometimes.
Not because you have to.

427
00:34:33,614 --> 00:34:37,255
General Elton McGuire is in
charge of the weapon system.

428
00:34:40,135 --> 00:34:44,496
General, I don't want to bother
you anymore or your family.

429
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,057
But tomorrow there will be a
mob of me back here.

430
00:34:49,577 --> 00:34:52,938
So, if you have anything to say,
why not say it now, sir, the way you want?

431
00:34:53,298 --> 00:34:58,459
That's great. I think it's great you
left in what you said. Just great.

432
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:02,699
Yes, please let's never forget.
We're the real story. Not them.

433
00:35:03,099 --> 00:35:06,660
Yeah, I know,
I went back and forth on it.

434
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,901
I liked it. He's not afraid of being human.

435
00:35:13,901 --> 00:35:15,662
Tom Grunick, The Pentagon.

436
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,302
This if the Pentagon did
have enough problems...

437
00:35:19,342 --> 00:35:22,743
Thanks Jenny.
Sure.

438
00:35:22,903 --> 00:35:28,824
Tom, My youngest wanted to meet you.
This is Ellie.

439
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:30,265
Hi, Ellie.
Hi.

440
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:34,785
You should be honored
she never wanted to meet anyone here before.

441
00:35:35,946 --> 00:35:39,786
But she said that she just
love you on television just now.

442
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:44,107
Hi, Ellie, remember me?

443
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,908
I'm not sure. I'm sorry.

444
00:35:46,948 --> 00:35:48,468
I've been to your house.

445
00:35:48,508 --> 00:35:52,989
And Aaron went on that 14 day
raft trip with us last year.

446
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,870
Oh yeah.

447
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,471
I had a big yellow raincoat on.

448
00:36:06,111 --> 00:36:07,992
It was over my head.
Yeah.

449
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:10,712
The hair's different.
Yeah. Hi.

450
00:36:12,072 --> 00:36:13,073
She knows me.

451
00:36:14,713 --> 00:36:19,354
Hi, Dad... Did you see it?

452
00:36:22,194 --> 00:36:23,635
I'll send you a tape...

453
00:36:25,595 --> 00:36:31,476
I'm sorry I haven't called.
Things were a little bumpy for a while.

454
00:36:32,796 --> 00:36:34,197
It's not important...

455
00:36:36,317 --> 00:36:38,317
Hey, Dad.

456
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,118
I think I just may be able to do this job...

457
00:36:46,959 --> 00:36:49,680
I'm glad you were sure.

458
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:54,400
Our host.

459
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,361
Come on in.
Sorry we're late. Jane's fault.

460
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:03,802
I don't know why we have
to feel defensive about it.

461
00:37:03,842 --> 00:37:07,443
Newspapers are in business to make money.
Why not us?

462
00:37:07,803 --> 00:37:13,524
I mean They criticize us for supposedly
pandering while they run WINGO Games.

463
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,764
Exactly right.

464
00:37:16,325 --> 00:37:18,805
Excuse me. I'm paid to mix.

465
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:22,686
Goodbye, Paul.
Take care, Paul.

466
00:37:25,046 --> 00:37:26,486
It takes a certain kind of...

467
00:37:26,526 --> 00:37:30,127
...courage to talk like that in front
of the President of the News Division.

468
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:33,288
You think anyone who's proud of
the work we do is an ass kisser.

469
00:37:33,328 --> 00:37:36,528
No.
I think anyone who puckers their lips and...

470
00:37:36,568 --> 00:37:39,249
...presses it against his
boss' buttocks and then...

471
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:41,889
...smooches is an ass kisser.

472
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:44,330
My gosh,

473
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:49,211
and for a while there,
I was attracted to you.

474
00:37:49,251 --> 00:37:51,371
Wait a minute
that changes everything.

475
00:37:59,373 --> 00:38:00,413
x

476
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:03,853
Martin, would you excuse us for a minute.
No.

477
00:38:04,174 --> 00:38:06,054
Come on.

478
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,695
You know I didn't mean to ask

479
00:38:20,297 --> 00:38:22,017
This is very awkward.

480
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:30,499
I see Tom around you a lot...

481
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:34,419
...and this is such a small office
and I'd like to see him outside of work,

482
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:38,100
unless there's some reason for you to mind
in which case I just won't do anything.

483
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,621
Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? No.

484
00:38:43,261 --> 00:38:44,861
Why?

485
00:38:50,862 --> 00:38:52,583
I do mind.

486
00:38:55,743 --> 00:38:58,384
I mean I think about him outside
works sometimes but...

487
00:38:58,864 --> 00:39:00,184
...I know I don't respect him...

488
00:39:03,745 --> 00:39:06,785
So what am I talking about...
What am I saying to you?

489
00:39:07,265 --> 00:39:09,386
You're saying stay away from him.

490
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:11,706
I can't be.

491
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:14,467
We don't have to settle this
definitively right now.

492
00:39:15,107 --> 00:39:16,467
Wait a minute!

493
00:39:41,272 --> 00:39:45,553
Tell me one person who ever left
television news to work on a newspaper.

494
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:46,473
You're right.

495
00:39:47,433 --> 00:39:48,313
Looks good.

496
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:58,395
See you.

497
00:40:07,757 --> 00:40:09,677
Hi Tom.
Hi.

498
00:40:11,157 --> 00:40:13,678
It's the firs time I've seen
you dressed like this.

499
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:16,879
You look so clean and pretty.

500
00:40:17,759 --> 00:40:20,359
What do you mean clean?

501
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:24,560
At work there's always
this sort of film over you.

502
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:30,001
I've got to find someone.

503
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:34,202
It's important. Excuse me.

504
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:46,524
Jennifer. Hey, Jennifer.

505
00:40:47,764 --> 00:40:51,485
Forget what I said you do
whatever you want to with him.

506
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:53,926
there's nothing I'm going
to do right this second.

507
00:40:53,966 --> 00:40:56,846
Oh come on. It's your day off.

508
00:40:57,806 --> 00:40:59,046
You're entitled.

509
00:41:03,807 --> 00:41:05,448
You're leaving?

510
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:30,772
Okay. Right away.

511
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:39,174
Ernie.
Tom. Tom.

512
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:40,694
What is it?

513
00:41:41,334 --> 00:41:43,815
A Libyan plane just shot up
one of our bases in Sicilia.

514
00:41:43,855 --> 00:41:48,096
This might be at the time to tap that source
of us. He might have an angle or something.

515
00:41:48,136 --> 00:41:49,576
Jennifer we need you.

516
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:59,938
Jane We want you to exec
produce a Special Report...

517
00:42:00,738 --> 00:42:01,538
What?

518
00:42:01,578 --> 00:42:05,539
A Libyan plane just shot up one of our
bases in Sicilia. It's all still happening.

519
00:42:05,819 --> 00:42:08,180
Since Paul's here,
he's made out the assignments...

520
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,780
So Jennifer at the White House...

521
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,300
George at the Pentagon...

522
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:12,580
Martin at State...

523
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,941
...and we need an anchor
since Rorish is in his boat,

524
00:42:15,981 --> 00:42:19,982
...so we're gonna do the whole report
this afternoon from here... with Tom.

525
00:42:20,022 --> 00:42:21,822
What?

526
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,663
You're not gonna use him at all?
It's not my choice.

527
00:42:29,263 --> 00:42:31,984
It's 1:35 and it is Tom.

528
00:42:33,744 --> 00:42:35,185
You can reach me at the office.

529
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:37,985
Paul forgive me. I'm really sorry
interrupting you.

530
00:42:39,385 --> 00:42:42,986
Paul. Yes, I need to talk to
you outside for just a minute.

531
00:42:43,986 --> 00:42:45,547
Great.

532
00:42:52,148 --> 00:42:55,308
Tom isn't ready for the job you're
about to hand him. Not near ready.

533
00:42:55,428 --> 00:42:57,189
Not by the longest shot.

534
00:42:57,229 --> 00:43:00,469
And Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli,
he's interviewed Gaddafi...

535
00:43:00,509 --> 00:43:02,390
...he reported on the Eight-one story.

536
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:05,350
I think he's essential to do
the job we're capable of...

537
00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:08,791
...and I think it's my
responsibility to tell you that.

538
00:43:08,831 --> 00:43:11,391
Okay, that's your opinion.
I don't agree.

539
00:43:11,431 --> 00:43:13,392
It's not opinion.

540
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:20,913
You're just absolutely right
and I'm absolutely wrong?

541
00:43:22,153 --> 00:43:25,674
It must be nice to always
believe you know better.

542
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:29,155
To think you're always the
smartest person in the room.

543
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:31,715
No, it's awful.

544
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:35,236
You better get going.

545
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:51,599
Nervous?
Excited.

546
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:56,360
Tell George and Jennifer to
try and cover everything...

547
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,120
...without Tom having to
ask additional questions.

548
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,081
Ok Bobbie says...
Did you hear what I just said?

549
00:44:02,281 --> 00:44:04,761
Do you have that? Take a breath.

550
00:44:07,962 --> 00:44:09,962
And the most important thing...

551
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:11,683
...make sure his earpiece works,

552
00:44:11,723 --> 00:44:14,483
...have back-ups ready.
That's never been more vital.

553
00:44:14,563 --> 00:44:18,084
He must be able to hear me
at every second and clearly.

554
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:56,171
Tom.

555
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:01,172
We have twenty minutes.
Yeah ok.

556
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,493
You can wait in the studio.

557
00:45:52,902 --> 00:45:54,302
Stand by

558
00:46:02,264 --> 00:46:04,384
Good luck Jenny.
Ready.

559
00:46:13,986 --> 00:46:16,946
Stand by please.
Thirty seconds to get ready

560
00:46:17,586 --> 00:46:20,427
All the most checked in.
Everyone hears the program clearly?

561
00:46:20,507 --> 00:46:25,068
Yes. Everything's good.
Executive producer. Wow.

562
00:46:25,148 --> 00:46:27,588
Stand by bt5.
I'm gonna seconds there.

563
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,909
Thirty seconds. Alright.
Stand by camera one please...

564
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:35,670
Tom, can you hear me?

565
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:43,111
Tom, can you hear me?
Tom? Tom?

566
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:47,752
Damn it... He can't hear me...
I told you if there was one thing...

567
00:46:47,792 --> 00:46:50,393
I can hear you. I was just teasing.

568
00:46:59,554 --> 00:47:00,755
Good afternoon.

569
00:47:01,075 --> 00:47:02,875
A Libyan fighter plane attacked...

570
00:47:02,915 --> 00:47:07,796
...a United States Military Installation
at Sicilia at 10.07am.

571
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:14,437
Libyan made 21 and it was itself
shot down by American F-14 Interceptors.

572
00:47:21,278 --> 00:47:25,559
The Libyan missile destroyed an army
warehouse which, just 30 minutes earlier,

573
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:27,680
...had been crowded with servicemen.

574
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,841
When we take it back...

575
00:47:33,921 --> 00:47:36,361
I can sing while I read...

576
00:47:36,441 --> 00:47:39,682
I can singing and reading both.

577
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:53,164
The Libyan made 21...
on the U.S. air station at Sicilia.

578
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:57,445
The heat seeking missile virtually
disintegrated the plane on contact...

579
00:48:06,167 --> 00:48:07,967
All remote stand by please.

580
00:48:11,608 --> 00:48:13,528
George, you're ready?
Yeah

581
00:48:13,568 --> 00:48:16,969
Should I cover everything or should
I save something for Tom to ask about?

582
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:18,529
Cover everything!

583
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,210
Ok, we're going to George.

584
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:25,171
Say'the Joint Chiefs are meeting
we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.

585
00:48:28,651 --> 00:48:31,212
George Weln is at the Pentagon and reports...

586
00:48:31,252 --> 00:48:34,252
...that the attack launched
by the lone Libyan pilot...

587
00:48:34,292 --> 00:48:38,133
...has resulted in a massive
movement of US military might.

588
00:48:38,173 --> 00:48:43,574
A lot of alliteration from anxious
anchors placed in powerful posts.

589
00:48:51,936 --> 00:48:54,456
x

590
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,257
It's Aaron.

591
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:00,017
Yes?
Hi.

592
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:04,218
Listen. The pilot that shot down the
Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.

593
00:49:04,258 --> 00:49:05,698
Maybe you could get him.

594
00:49:05,738 --> 00:49:09,259
Also Tom should say that F-14 is
one of the hardest planes to fly.

595
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,619
And They're nicknamed'Tomcats'.
Thanks.

596
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,900
The F-14 is one of the most
difficult planes to master.

597
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,461
They called'Tomcats'

598
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:21,661
George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat...

599
00:49:21,701 --> 00:49:24,782
...one of the most difficult
machines for a pilot to master?

600
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:25,662
I think you're right.

601
00:49:25,702 --> 00:49:28,903
and in the 70's the first crop
had a number of crashes.

602
00:49:28,943 --> 00:49:31,903
There was trouble with them
in the early days back in the 70's.

603
00:49:32,223 --> 00:49:33,943
Thank you George.
Jennifer Mack.

604
00:49:35,104 --> 00:49:38,344
I say it here. It comes out there.

605
00:49:44,425 --> 00:49:46,146
Hi.
Me again.

606
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:49,106
Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam
at the mouth or anything.

607
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:52,947
When you speak to him he's not at all nuts.

608
00:49:53,387 --> 00:49:57,108
He seems like a leader very impressive,
self-control... that's what's so crazy.

609
00:49:57,148 --> 00:50:00,989
Ok good. And we have the'81 pilot on
the way in Nobody else will have him.

610
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:04,429
You're welcome. So how does
it feel to be executive producer?

611
00:50:04,789 --> 00:50:07,990
I gotta go.
Me too. Gotte go. We're very busy here.

612
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:19,072
It's the Gulf of Sidra.

613
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:23,073
The name of the US commander
is Nathan Benchley.

614
00:50:23,113 --> 00:50:28,394
In the summer of 1981 two Libyan jets
suddenly attacked to American air...

615
00:50:28,434 --> 00:50:30,834
The plan against Nathan

616
00:50:36,435 --> 00:50:37,635
I don't really well...

617
00:50:37,715 --> 00:50:39,316
...nations including the US...

618
00:50:39,356 --> 00:50:44,157
...after a brief dogfight both Libyan jets
were down by the American fighters.

619
00:50:44,237 --> 00:50:47,957
The name's Nathan Bencley.
... is at the Pentagon.

620
00:50:47,997 --> 00:50:50,918
So, -that's great. That's great-
commander, it must have been a bit tougher...

621
00:50:51,118 --> 00:50:54,719
...today, shooting down the Mig-21
The one you got was SU-22...

622
00:50:54,759 --> 00:50:58,439
- What is it like... -
What is it like to be in a dog fight?

623
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,600
Ok, after this guy, we'll go for...
about ten seconds.

624
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,081
Ask him how does he know when he has a hit.

625
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:10,322
Dou you know you have a hit from one of
those screens inside your cockpit or...

626
00:51:10,362 --> 00:51:11,482
That's good. That's good.

627
00:51:14,042 --> 00:51:16,403
The equipment is very
sophisticated but the...

628
00:51:16,443 --> 00:51:20,524
...whole pilot point of view you like to see
it to conform it. Thank you commander.

629
00:51:21,124 --> 00:51:24,924
It's always been considered
an outlaw nation but strangely...

630
00:51:24,964 --> 00:51:27,565
...some of those who have
interviewed Gaddafi find him,

631
00:51:27,605 --> 00:51:29,925
...in a phrase we like
to use in this country,

632
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:32,606
very'presidential'.
Nice, Jane.

633
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:34,086
Just a minute.

634
00:51:34,126 --> 00:51:36,487
Then we gotta get Martin Klein
To State for the message from Libya,

635
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,487
...then you'll have the carrier pilot
from the Sidra in time to...

636
00:51:39,527 --> 00:51:43,808
What? No! You missed him!
We only have ten minutes left.

637
00:51:43,848 --> 00:51:46,168
How can you talk to me
about parking problems?

638
00:51:46,448 --> 00:51:52,410
No, not you'll try, you'll do it, do it or
I'll fry your fat ass, Estelle. Good-bye.

639
00:51:52,650 --> 00:51:55,690
I had no idea she was this good.

640
00:51:55,730 --> 00:51:58,491
Tom,

641
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,611
Fill for a second.

642
00:52:05,612 --> 00:52:09,853
The latest message seems to
indicate that the Libyan pilot was...

643
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:13,173
...acting on his own without
authority from anyone else.

644
00:52:13,974 --> 00:52:16,814
In other words, I think we're all okay.

645
00:52:16,894 --> 00:52:18,094
Ok Tom.

646
00:52:19,215 --> 00:52:23,175
The Libyan Government has disavowed
any prior knowledge of the attack.

647
00:52:23,215 --> 00:52:27,176
I'm Tom Grunick, reporting from Washington.
Good afternoon.

648
00:52:27,696 --> 00:52:32,497
Animation. Thanks everybody.
We are out.

649
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:46,660
You're great.

650
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,420
I've never been as proud
of one of my decisions.

651
00:52:54,661 --> 00:52:57,102
Great work, Jane, really
You know? Really.

652
00:52:57,142 --> 00:52:59,062
Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

653
00:53:00,382 --> 00:53:04,623
No major gaffs? You were brilliant.

654
00:53:13,185 --> 00:53:14,185
Thank you Jane.

655
00:53:15,585 --> 00:53:16,825
Thanks Ernie.
Sure.

656
00:53:18,266 --> 00:53:20,146
This was important for Tom.

657
00:53:20,186 --> 00:53:22,947
There's that bonding thing
that happens with the public...

658
00:53:22,987 --> 00:53:25,587
...and an anchorman during a crisis.

659
00:53:25,627 --> 00:53:30,308
It's not the conventions anymore;
it's this kind of moment.

660
00:53:30,348 --> 00:53:32,068
Oh, hi.
Hi.

661
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,189
Great job.
You too.

662
00:53:44,351 --> 00:53:45,751
Good work Tom.
Thanks.

663
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,232
What a baptismal. Congratulations.

664
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:53,192
Thanks. With all the help you get,
it's sure easier than local.

665
00:53:53,232 --> 00:53:56,633
Where's Jane? Ý'm still juiced.
She's back there. Thanks.

666
00:53:57,113 --> 00:54:00,234
Can I help you gentleman?
We're here to play the new news theme.

667
00:54:06,435 --> 00:54:08,275
You're an amazing woman.

668
00:54:09,195 --> 00:54:12,196
What a feeling having you inside my head.

669
00:54:12,236 --> 00:54:16,077
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.

670
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:21,118
It's like indescribable, you knew
just when to feed me the next line...

671
00:54:23,478 --> 00:54:25,358
...second before I needed it.

672
00:54:25,558 --> 00:54:31,119
There was a rhythm we got into,
It was like great sex.

673
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,720
You have to celebrate with me,
don't you?

674
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,961
Everybody's going to that
bar down the street,'Caps. '

675
00:54:39,121 --> 00:54:41,041
I'm going over to Aaron's.

676
00:54:41,081 --> 00:54:43,122
But maybe I'll hook up with all of you later

677
00:54:43,162 --> 00:54:45,642
How long do you think you'll be there?

678
00:54:53,284 --> 00:54:57,644
It starts off,
but it's very hi-tech syntho... like this.

679
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,450
Big finish.

680
00:55:30,251 --> 00:55:32,091
I got chills.

681
00:55:33,091 --> 00:55:35,732
Wasn't Tom great?
Well, it worked.

682
00:55:52,095 --> 00:55:53,655
Really?

683
00:55:55,175 --> 00:55:56,656
It was good.

684
00:55:58,216 --> 00:56:00,416
Your calling in that information.

685
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:03,577
You are the classiest guy I know.

686
00:56:04,017 --> 00:56:05,897
Here. Have a beer.

687
00:56:06,177 --> 00:56:07,618
Celebrate.

688
00:56:08,538 --> 00:56:13,059
God. It was so strange watching him.
What's the next step? Lip synching?

689
00:56:13,099 --> 00:56:15,139
Okay.

690
00:56:17,219 --> 00:56:20,740
You know I've been doing some of the
most important thinking of my life today.

691
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:23,621
I wonder if this is the right
time to tell you about it.

692
00:56:23,661 --> 00:56:25,101
Whatever you think.

693
00:56:25,261 --> 00:56:28,942
I figured out why it is I'm so hung up on
getting a chance at weekend anchor...

694
00:56:29,902 --> 00:56:31,702
It's because if I do that well,

695
00:56:31,942 --> 00:56:33,382
...then they'll pay me more,

696
00:56:33,422 --> 00:56:36,463
...and my life will be great and
they'll treat me better. That's why.

697
00:56:36,703 --> 00:56:38,303
Sounds like you may be on to something.

698
00:56:38,343 --> 00:56:40,504
Which means I'm at their mercy...

699
00:56:40,704 --> 00:56:42,264
...and who wants that?

700
00:56:43,464 --> 00:56:46,185
No, I don't want to tell you
where this thought led me...

701
00:56:47,425 --> 00:56:48,665
Why not?

702
00:56:49,465 --> 00:56:50,546
In the middle of all of this...

703
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:54,266
I started to think about the one thing
that makes me feel really good...

704
00:56:54,306 --> 00:56:56,267
...and makes immediate sense...

705
00:56:56,587 --> 00:56:57,907
...and it's you.

706
00:57:03,788 --> 00:57:05,428
I'm gonna stop right now.

707
00:57:07,149 --> 00:57:10,429
Except I would give anything
if you were two people...

708
00:57:10,629 --> 00:57:12,790
...so I could call up the one
who's my friend...

709
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,431
...and tell her about the one
that I like so much.

710
00:57:26,472 --> 00:57:28,393
I'm not gonna say any more.

711
00:57:29,753 --> 00:57:31,953
I merely do some about the pa...

712
00:57:32,954 --> 00:57:34,634
Come on. I'll walk you to the corner.

713
00:57:34,674 --> 00:57:35,874
You get some sleep.

714
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:38,715
Right now?
After I walking.

715
00:57:45,116 --> 00:57:46,836
You were stunning today.

716
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:50,837
There, You have some place to go?
Yeah.

717
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,158
Good night.

718
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:01,799
Well, I felt something.

719
00:58:14,081 --> 00:58:17,682
Hey. We're going to Caps Bar at
Seventeenth and Vermont;

720
00:58:17,722 --> 00:58:19,802
Connecticut is clear on Sunday so...

721
00:58:19,883 --> 00:58:22,123
...take that over to Fifteenth,

722
00:58:22,283 --> 00:58:27,204
...and then straight down Vermont and we
should bypass Thomas circle that way.

723
00:58:27,244 --> 00:58:31,845
If you don't go over forty we
should catch mostly green lights.

724
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:45,007
I didn't think you'd make it.

725
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:48,368
Well, I thought I'd check and see
if all of you were still here.

726
00:58:48,408 --> 00:58:51,248
But you know I'll just go in and
join the gang and you two go on.

727
00:58:51,288 --> 00:58:56,009
All the gangs have gone. We were
the last ones. There's no more gangs.

728
00:58:59,530 --> 00:59:03,011
Well, I'll go in and have a burger.

729
00:59:03,051 --> 00:59:05,051
Jennifer, you want to have another burger?

730
00:59:05,891 --> 00:59:09,652
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.

731
00:59:10,812 --> 00:59:12,812
I just feel like a little solitude.

732
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:15,213
I sure know that feeling.

733
00:59:15,973 --> 00:59:17,893
Terrific work today.

734
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:19,614
Right back to you.

735
00:59:19,654 --> 00:59:21,134
Thanks.

736
00:59:23,254 --> 00:59:25,295
Good night.

737
00:59:39,458 --> 00:59:40,658
I feel great.

738
00:59:40,698 --> 00:59:42,258
Are you sure you...

739
00:59:42,298 --> 00:59:43,338
What for?

740
00:59:47,739 --> 00:59:53,260
We have the greatest car and the
greatest driver in all of Washington...

741
01:00:24,106 --> 01:00:26,146
Give me some of that.

742
01:00:27,146 --> 01:00:29,627
Where's the bathroom?
Through the closet.

743
01:00:37,308 --> 01:00:40,629
I'm so tired of being
defensive about my closet.

744
01:00:40,869 --> 01:00:43,470
But I always had problems
with space and it was...

745
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:47,710
...getting store I couldn't find anything
and you know how always buy new things.

746
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:49,791
So I converted a bedroom...

747
01:00:49,831 --> 01:00:52,431
...and wait till you've been
doing this sixteen years.

748
01:00:52,631 --> 01:00:54,352
I think it's a great solution.

749
01:00:54,392 --> 01:00:57,952
Not only the storage but
you can see everything you have.

750
01:01:00,433 --> 01:01:02,233
Do you do bunny rabbits?

751
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:11,155
Isn't this a great date?

752
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:27,238
Morning.

753
01:01:28,478 --> 01:01:29,758
Good morning.

754
01:01:32,279 --> 01:01:33,919
God help me.

755
01:01:44,681 --> 01:01:47,122
Well, They've been looking at
just about everything.

756
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,362
Foren bureaus, domestic bureaus...

757
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:52,603
...and all kind of personal even equipment

758
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:57,403
Anyway, they seem to be very very serious...

759
01:01:57,724 --> 01:01:59,284
...about making me cut...

760
01:01:59,564 --> 01:02:02,364
24 million from the budget.

761
01:02:04,205 --> 01:02:07,565
Now this is going to mean massive firings...

762
01:02:09,606 --> 01:02:11,606
I'm doing whatever I can.

763
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:15,687
But I did want you to be aware...

764
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:18,607
...of this very serious situation.

765
01:02:19,248 --> 01:02:24,889
Now, we're going to also be covering
the Alaskan serial killer trial...

766
01:02:24,969 --> 01:02:28,929
on a continuing basis. I'd like it
to be assigned out of Washington...

767
01:02:28,969 --> 01:02:32,490
which means we're going to have to
get someone on a plane to Anchorage.

768
01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:35,331
We can't fool around anymore.
Jane.

769
01:02:37,091 --> 01:02:41,372
Who do you think? George Weln or Jennifer?
Jennifer.

770
01:02:56,215 --> 01:02:58,975
Night Emily.
Good night Jane.

771
01:02:59,415 --> 01:03:04,776
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big
thing going on over at the Italian embassy.

772
01:03:07,177 --> 01:03:09,617
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.

773
01:03:10,577 --> 01:03:12,218
I'll be the judge of that.

774
01:03:13,938 --> 01:03:15,898
I'll get my coat.

775
01:03:19,779 --> 01:03:21,339
Two please.

776
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:27,861
Tom?

777
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:38,020
I'm alright.

778
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,260
Heavy hitters.
Yeah.

779
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,700
How you doing?
Good.

780
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,620
Network news. Washington.

781
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,860
I love it.

782
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:58,380
What do yo do when your real life
exceeds you dreams?

783
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:00,540
Keep it to yourself.

784
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:05,820
You know yesterday
I really wanted to know your...

785
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:08,420
...reaction to how we did
with the Libyan report.

786
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:12,980
I was going to ask but I think I'm...

787
01:04:14,380 --> 01:04:16,260
...I'm a little intimidated with you.

788
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,060
Oh, stop it.

789
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:21,460
You can't talk about feeling intimidated
when you're on top of the world...

790
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:24,700
...It's unseemly.
I'm not buying into any of that.

791
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:27,220
I have a load to learn.
I'm not goingto act as if...

792
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,580
You have the job you have...
Shut up for a second.

793
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:30,820
Okay.

794
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,060
Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?

795
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:44,180
I made one rule for myself
when this started...

796
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:47,060
...and I realized that I was going
to take a lot from you people...

797
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,860
because of being from sports...
And the rule was...

798
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,820
Never to pretend to know more than I did.

799
01:04:56,180 --> 01:04:58,540
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?

800
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,940
Okay, let's drop it.
What?

801
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:05,580
I mean I'm not gonna take a test for you...

802
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,780
I mean if that came up in conversation...

803
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:12,140
We're conversing. Oh no the names
of the Cabinet has slipped my mind.

804
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:13,780
Do you know them?

805
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:19,180
Ok, don't name them for me.
Just tell me if you know.

806
01:05:19,220 --> 01:05:23,140
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Okay.

807
01:05:23,980 --> 01:05:25,700
All twelve?

808
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:29,540
Yes.
There is only ten.

809
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:35,540
You're feeling good, aren't you?
I'm starting to... Yeah.

810
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:38,540
We may do the capitols of the states next.

811
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,020
Fifty, right?

812
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:50,860
Hi. There you are.

813
01:06:03,860 --> 01:06:05,940
x
Yes.

814
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,660
I'm so exhausted.

815
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,540
Punchy. Sick tired.

816
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:17,260
I can't think and I can't move.

817
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,580
I'm just a dead lump...

818
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,700
...of poured out flesh.

819
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,580
Would you like to come up?

820
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:31,020
Maybe we could just sit here.

821
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,580
Talk a little?
Okay.

822
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:43,740
I'm going to have to do a story
from beginning to end on my own.

823
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:46,020
Eventually.

824
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,180
I have an idea for something.

825
01:06:52,940 --> 01:06:54,140
What?

826
01:06:57,420 --> 01:07:01,060
If I tell you, can you manage
not to put it down or or...

827
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:03,420
...or tell me why it won't work or...

828
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:06,980
...is in bad journalistic taste
or anything like that?

829
01:07:07,140 --> 01:07:09,340
Yes, Tom. I think I can manage.

830
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:12,100
Okay.

831
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:18,860
It's about women who are attacked
by someone they know on a date...

832
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:24,540
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it...

833
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:28,900
Keep it there.
Wait a minute...

834
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:30,220
I didn't say anything.

835
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:33,060
I'm innocent before...

836
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,140
Innocent?
You're guilty.

837
01:07:41,980 --> 01:07:43,620
Door. Door.

838
01:08:04,220 --> 01:08:05,140
Hello.

839
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,580
Jane. Yes.

840
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:19,380
Tom? Ýs that you?
Yes.

841
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:21,660
Hey you called me.

842
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,140
Is it your story?

843
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:25,980
No.

844
01:08:29,220 --> 01:08:31,900
Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner?

845
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,460
Why, you need me for the story?

846
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,580
No.

847
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,500
Were you going to go?

848
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,820
Maybe I'll get off work.

849
01:08:44,140 --> 01:08:45,300
I'd like to go.

850
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:47,140
Good.

851
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,380
We can go together.

852
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:53,660
So.

853
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,860
So you like me, huh?

854
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:03,020
I like you as much as I can like
anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

855
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:10,060
street cops say... that fits.
Is that last cut work for you, Bobbie?

856
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:12,820
Yeah.
Good.

857
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,380
Thank you for asking.
Thank you.

858
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:21,140
Acording to the FBI...

859
01:09:21,180 --> 01:09:25,260
...there are more than
87000 rapes reported last year.

860
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:27,940
Most people think
if a rapist has a violent stranger...

861
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:31,300
...but today an attack
may be what's called'date rape'...

862
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,620
...being forced to have sexual intercourse
against your will with someone you know.

863
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:38,300
It's just you want to find a nice guy...

864
01:09:40,100 --> 01:09:41,460
So anyways,

865
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:45,140
it was that you know
'give-him-a-chance' thing.

866
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:51,580
I was lonely.

867
01:09:53,340 --> 01:09:54,500
So,

868
01:09:54,900 --> 01:09:56,580
We went to a movie...

869
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:02,340
...and when he brought me home.
He said could he come up for one beer...

870
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:03,900
...and then he would go.

871
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:06,980
So how do you say'no', to that?

872
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,540
My cousin done it.
Really?

873
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:11,940
So first...

874
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:17,940
it was kind of a like wrestling match...

875
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,860
...which was awful enough because...

876
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,180
...it got very violent.

877
01:10:27,860 --> 01:10:29,820
I'm a modest person...

878
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:36,860
...then he ripped my clothes off...

879
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,620
...and he forced me to...

880
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:46,340
...make love.

881
01:10:48,380 --> 01:10:51,020
And the he stayed in my apartment...

882
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,700
...and he forced me more times.

883
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:00,220
I'm sorry.

884
01:11:00,780 --> 01:11:02,980
I promised myself I wasn't gonna cry...

885
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:07,100
It's just...

886
01:11:08,780 --> 01:11:12,660
...this whole thing has just messed me up.

887
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:15,420
Can I turn on the news for a second?

888
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,340
Alright, sex, tears, this must be the news.

889
01:11:20,100 --> 01:11:21,620
I'm sorry. I'm in a pissy mood.

890
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:22,820
What's wrong with it?

891
01:11:22,860 --> 01:11:25,660
Nothing.
I think you really blew the lid off nookie.

892
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:32,860
The victims often remain
too terrified to talk...

893
01:11:32,900 --> 01:11:35,260
...the police powerless
to perform properly...

894
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:39,740
...and all the social welfare groups can
finally do is monitor this epidemic...

895
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:41,660
...of crime without punishment.

896
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,700
Tom Grunick, Annandale, Virginia.

897
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:54,140
Malcolm West on trial
for the murders of 15 men...

898
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,020
Nice work.
I've got to get a crew off the clock.

899
01:12:09,740 --> 01:12:11,060
What did you think?

900
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:18,660
It moved me.

901
01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:22,700
I did relate to it. I really did.

902
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:24,860
It was...

903
01:12:25,940 --> 01:12:28,700
...unusual for you to cut to
yourself when you tear up...

904
01:12:28,740 --> 01:12:32,540
...and that might not have been...
my choice.

905
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,460
...but it was real and it got me...

906
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,980
and...

907
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:41,220
I think a lot of the time I'm too
conservative about that kind of stuff.

908
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:46,860
Okay?
Okay.

909
01:12:54,780 --> 01:12:57,860
Hey Tom. God it was really swell tonight.
Good.

910
01:12:58,380 --> 01:13:02,020
Four more bodies now taken
from the frozen earth.

911
01:13:02,660 --> 01:13:06,540
Jennifer Mack, Alaska.

912
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:12,980
How are you?

913
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,780
I was just writing you a note.

914
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,300
What do you say we take a walk?

915
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:22,940
Outside?
Yeah.

916
01:13:31,460 --> 01:13:33,620
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...

917
01:13:36,060 --> 01:13:38,300
...it's just somebody with your brilliance...

918
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:42,980
...gets nibbles about
other jobs now and again...

919
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,460
...maybe down the road
you should look into it.

920
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:50,900
Ah, damn those fucking jerks.
They want to fire me.

921
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,140
All I know is that they've got to
fire a large number of people...

922
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:04,300
...and not even going by seniority.

923
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,580
There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Do one thing to me? What?

924
01:14:08,620 --> 01:14:10,740
Get me one shot at
anchoring the Weekend News...

925
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:14,260
...they've never seen me do that.
It could turn it around for me.

926
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:16,900
I could do that this Saturday.

927
01:14:17,340 --> 01:14:20,500
Everybody wants off for the
Correspondents' Dinner. -Do it then.

928
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:25,940
Please prepare carefully.
This couldn't happen at a better time.

929
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,540
Prepare what?
You have Saturday's news handy?

930
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:32,540
It's a long while since you read the news.
I'll have somebody work with you on it.

931
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:36,460
Just on superficial performance things.
Please.

932
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:39,300
Okay.

933
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,580
I think I'd better be alone for a while.

934
01:14:42,620 --> 01:14:45,420
I understand. I'll go with you.
Thanks.

935
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:52,900
This is very uncomfortable for me...

936
01:14:54,020 --> 01:14:58,620
...because well I don't mean This is a knock
but we approach this thing so differently.

937
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:00,580
We sure do.

938
01:15:01,460 --> 01:15:03,620
and I don't mean it as a knock either.

939
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:06,060
Ok, go ahead.

940
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:11,340
I'll just tell what I think
and you can disregard it if you want.

941
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,500
Alright, I just don't know how
effective this is gonna be...

942
01:15:13,540 --> 01:15:16,020
...because of our different approaches.

943
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:20,300
Ok.

944
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,540
Report tonight...
Wait.

945
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:26,420
What?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.

946
01:15:26,460 --> 01:15:27,220
Okay.

947
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:31,300
When you sit, sit on your jacket a little.

948
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:33,180
That'll give you a good line.

949
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:37,020
Report tonight...
Look at the monitor.

950
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:40,180
Ok.

951
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:45,980
Report tonight from far down on the Arabian
Peninsula indicate that heavy fight...

952
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:47,780
Your jacket Aaron.

953
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:51,260
For a second... What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

954
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:53,860
Sit on it.
No, but just dont handle me.

955
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:56,340
Sit on it.
I'm sitting on it.

956
01:15:56,420 --> 01:15:58,580
Now look.
Don't fit...

957
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,340
Fantastic tip.

958
01:16:02,180 --> 01:16:03,180
That's great.

959
01:16:07,340 --> 01:16:12,060
Continues for a second date between
government and rebel forces and...

960
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:13,060
No, no.

961
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:16,780
Don't let your eyes move from the beginning
of the sentence to the end like that.

962
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:18,660
You don't want to look shifty, do you?

963
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:19,620
No.

964
01:16:21,380 --> 01:16:23,900
And the right side of your
face is the good one.

965
01:16:25,060 --> 01:16:26,020
Go ahead.

966
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:28,260
They going to let me do the news like this?

967
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:33,860
Heavy fighting continues for a second day...

968
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,780
Try to punch one word or
phrase in every sentence.

969
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:42,100
One idea per story. Punch.

970
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,860
You were smokin' there toward the end.

971
01:16:46,940 --> 01:16:49,180
The pointers were great.
I'll study the tape.

972
01:16:49,220 --> 01:16:50,540
Go this way.

973
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:53,460
Just remember that you're not just
reading the news or narrating.

974
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,580
Everybody has to sell a little.
You're selling them this idea of you.

975
01:16:56,620 --> 01:16:58,260
You know, you're sort
of saying is,'trust me.

976
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:01,340
I'm... credible.

977
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:04,180
So when you feel yourself just reading...

978
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:08,780
...stop and start selling a little.

979
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,420
So long.

980
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:54,460
You look like... this porcelain thing.
You look beautiful.

981
01:17:54,580 --> 01:17:55,820
You look beautiful.

982
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,900
That's gorgeous.

983
01:18:01,180 --> 01:18:03,540
What are you carrying?
A fistful of... and ten jacket.

984
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:06,100
Help me pick some, come on.

985
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,060
Ok.

986
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,500
I'm thinking the grey suit.

987
01:18:16,260 --> 01:18:17,740
Tom... why don't I meet you there?

988
01:18:17,820 --> 01:18:20,580
I've got some last minute stuff
I've got to take care of...

989
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:24,900
Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma
did you rent the tux or buy it...

990
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,100
I knew it. How much?

991
01:18:29,860 --> 01:18:31,300
Okay. I see you there.

992
01:18:32,140 --> 01:18:33,740
I didn't know you were going with him.

993
01:18:33,940 --> 01:18:35,540
You are going to wear that shirt?

994
01:18:35,620 --> 01:18:36,740
No, blue.

995
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:38,420
Let me look at the grey.
Look.

996
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,340
Not bad, right?

997
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:46,540
So how about a necktie.
Ok, you brought all of them.

998
01:18:48,260 --> 01:18:50,940
How much was the tops?
Eleven hundered and fourty bucks.

999
01:18:50,980 --> 01:18:52,100
No.
Yes

1000
01:18:52,580 --> 01:18:54,100
Try this one.
Okay.

1001
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,540
Not bad.

1002
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,580
I read about it in the magazine...

1003
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:12,100
...that's how you can make sure
you don't put on too much perfume...

1004
01:19:12,140 --> 01:19:15,580
Could you at least pretend that this
is an awkward situation for you...

1005
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:18,180
...me showing up while you're
getting ready for a date.

1006
01:19:18,620 --> 01:19:20,140
It's not a date.

1007
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:23,500
It's co-workers going
to a professional conclave.

1008
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,060
I hate missing it.

1009
01:19:35,500 --> 01:19:36,820
I wish I could be there.

1010
01:19:36,940 --> 01:19:37,860
Me too.

1011
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:41,140
If it gets dull a little before
11:00, drop by the studio.

1012
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:42,660
I'm not sure I'll be able to.

1013
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,820
If... if not, I'll have the tape...

1014
01:19:45,220 --> 01:19:48,420
I'll wait for you at my house, ok?
Okay, great.

1015
01:19:54,140 --> 01:19:54,980
Good luck.

1016
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,460
Thanks.

1017
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,900
Have a good time tonight.
You too.

1018
01:20:01,340 --> 01:20:02,540
Come here.

1019
01:20:04,180 --> 01:20:05,540
What is it?

1020
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:07,460
What's the matter?

1021
01:20:09,700 --> 01:20:11,100
What are you doing.

1022
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,540
Oh no.

1023
01:20:19,620 --> 01:20:23,340
You are all wrinked and...
I've got shoulders.

1024
01:20:32,660 --> 01:20:33,540
Thanks.

1025
01:20:34,660 --> 01:20:37,260
Maybe I'll just stand here
and guard your corner.

1026
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,620
I'll be here when you get back.
Thanks very much.

1027
01:20:39,940 --> 01:20:41,140
Don't take in and go nineteen to
Pennsylvania. Turn the underpath right...

1028
01:21:08,780 --> 01:21:12,940
Hey Nick...

1029
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:17,780
Aaron.
Hey George.

1030
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,900
What are you doing here?
Anchoring...

1031
01:21:20,340 --> 01:21:22,940
...anchoring the weekend news.

1032
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,380
Way to go.
Thanks.

1033
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:29,620
This is terrific Aaron.

1034
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:31,460
It's a pleasure to read, really.

1035
01:21:31,540 --> 01:21:34,580
There's water on the set,
in case I get an attack of cotton mouth.

1036
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,500
Yeah, sure. You'll be fine.

1037
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,260
He was lecturing...

1038
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:50,300
...finally I just said I'm sorry...

1039
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:53,220
I refuse to look at it as a negative.
I'm young...

1040
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,580
...and my news appeals to people my age.

1041
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:59,500
And it's not like he just didn't hire a
twenty-six-year-old producer himself.

1042
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:01,740
No kidding, twenty-six.

1043
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,140
Well hello Tom.

1044
01:22:22,820 --> 01:22:24,740
He moves and smiles...

1045
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:33,900
If he doesn't see me soon,
we're not supposed to be together.

1046
01:22:48,460 --> 01:22:49,620
It's for me?

1047
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,740
Hi Jane.
Hey.

1048
01:23:08,660 --> 01:23:10,980
It's incredible who's here.

1049
01:23:11,020 --> 01:23:11,780
Who?

1050
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,300
Me.

1051
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,060
dress.
Thank you.

1052
01:23:20,020 --> 01:23:21,540
Ok 20 seconds there.

1053
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:25,540
15 seconds.

1054
01:23:28,380 --> 01:23:29,340
10 seconds.

1055
01:23:30,660 --> 01:23:31,580
Graphic.

1056
01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:35,540
The weekend report with Aaron Altman.
Go...

1057
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:37,020
Good Evening...

1058
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:40,940
In mood and language better
suited to an espionage novel...

1059
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:43,660
...than the delicate world
of the Western Alliance,

1060
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:48,260
...the British Foreign Secretary
today pounced on what he termed,

1061
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:52,220
...'The nest of professional spies
and amateur traitors...

1062
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:55,380
...who were turning NATO
Headquarters into an instrument...

1063
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:57,700
...whose only true function is folly. '

1064
01:23:58,140 --> 01:24:01,340
We begin our coverage
with Edward Towne in London.

1065
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,940
Take it.
The British Foreign Secretary use the...

1066
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:07,300
She's coming you now.
20 seconds.

1067
01:24:11,140 --> 01:24:12,580
Gee whiz.

1068
01:24:12,660 --> 01:24:14,620
I think I'm perspiring.

1069
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:16,340
Don't worry.

1070
01:24:19,660 --> 01:24:21,500
Are you seen this?

1071
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:31,860
5 seconds.

1072
01:24:33,940 --> 01:24:37,740
...the sub-bases referred to are
located in five countries...

1073
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:42,900
Norway, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Spain as well as Great Britain...

1074
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:45,300
This is more than Nixon ever sweated.

1075
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:49,540
Our own State Department was rocked
not only by the revelation...

1076
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:54,340
...but from the highly unusual
persistence of the State Press Corps.

1077
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,180
Nice...

1078
01:24:56,220 --> 01:25:00,620
Martin Klein reports on
the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

1079
01:25:02,780 --> 01:25:05,620
Just how noticeable is this, huh?

1080
01:25:10,660 --> 01:25:13,340
Do you have a big one?
Oh good Suzy, hurry.

1081
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:18,500
5 seconds!

1082
01:25:24,140 --> 01:25:28,380
A bomb exploded on a railroad
bridge outside of the India...

1083
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:30,300
...sending a passenger train...

1084
01:25:42,820 --> 01:25:48,140
120 people reported injured,
at least 22 people dead.

1085
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:51,300
Commercial.
I wish I were one of them.

1086
01:25:52,860 --> 01:25:56,620
Remember Brinkley's great line
"It's as irrevocable as a haircut. "

1087
01:26:01,620 --> 01:26:06,140
I like that.
Can I have your autograph for my wife?

1088
01:26:07,860 --> 01:26:09,340
How you doing, Paul?

1089
01:26:11,940 --> 01:26:16,460
You're finally learning to be flexible.
Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

1090
01:26:18,980 --> 01:26:20,580
Ma'am can I check your purse?

1091
01:26:20,860 --> 01:26:23,140
I'd like to... contents by myself.

1092
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,900
Excusae me sir.
May I see that briefcase?

1093
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:27,780
I'd like to check the contents.

1094
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:31,980
Can I see your purse please?

1095
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:34,620
We gotta go.
Huh?

1096
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:36,900
I'm sorry.
What?

1097
01:26:42,620 --> 01:26:44,820
You ok?

1098
01:26:45,980 --> 01:26:48,580
I'm so sorry I pulled you of the dinner...

1099
01:26:49,220 --> 01:26:52,580
These things can be a lot of fun,
everybody tries to me funny.

1100
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:54,900
All of this is suddenly obvious.

1101
01:26:55,820 --> 01:26:59,980
People trying to make political careers
out of how many laugh together.

1102
01:27:00,220 --> 01:27:03,780
When you...
Why can't I let go of this woman?

1103
01:27:27,220 --> 01:27:29,100
At least kiss me when you do that.

1104
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:32,140
You just can't stop editing me.
Huh?

1105
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:35,140
This is hysterical.

1106
01:27:56,460 --> 01:28:00,100
I was half hoping I wouldn't
have a good time tonight.

1107
01:28:00,140 --> 01:28:01,300
You know why?

1108
01:28:02,340 --> 01:28:03,860
Because you're nuts.

1109
01:28:04,620 --> 01:28:07,380
Right, right.
Isn't she fun to tease?

1110
01:28:12,740 --> 01:28:16,340
What?
More and more lately...

1111
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,300
...when I've watched you in action...

1112
01:28:19,340 --> 01:28:23,900
...seen all your energy.

1113
01:28:24,220 --> 01:28:25,860
I've been wondering...

1114
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,660
...what it would be like
to be inside all that energy.

1115
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:41,780
Me too.

1116
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:50,740
I don't remember ever saying
anything like that exactly...

1117
01:28:50,820 --> 01:28:53,140
I don't know why I just did.

1118
01:28:53,180 --> 01:28:55,420
Oh let's see. Wait a minute,

1119
01:28:56,260 --> 01:28:58,060
Well, I can think of two reasons.
What?

1120
01:28:58,260 --> 01:28:59,900
Three... I just thought of a third...

1121
01:28:59,940 --> 01:29:02,140
If you talk about it,
you don't have to do it.

1122
01:29:02,180 --> 01:29:03,460
That's not it.
Good.

1123
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:07,220
Another is you're trying to make it
all about sex and heat and nothing else.

1124
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,260
or...

1125
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:14,300
...it's that great feeling that you
don't want to hold anything back.

1126
01:29:14,380 --> 01:29:16,500
You know, intimacy.

1127
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,020
Oh, shit. I'm a creep.
What?

1128
01:29:20,140 --> 01:29:23,340
I forgot all about Aaron. I promised
to stop by and see how he did.

1129
01:29:23,380 --> 01:29:25,180
I'd like to know. I'll go along.

1130
01:29:25,220 --> 01:29:26,100
No.

1131
01:29:26,660 --> 01:29:29,060
I'll be back at your place
as soon as I can.

1132
01:29:30,420 --> 01:29:32,900
Jane!
What happened?

1133
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:38,140
Don't run off like everything's settled
the minute you make up your mind.

1134
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,260
He might be weird,

1135
01:29:39,300 --> 01:29:42,660
He can talk more freely if I go alone,
why's that so hard to understand?

1136
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,220
It's not that it's hard. It's just
that I like you to give me a minute...

1137
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:48,700
...so I can catch up.

1138
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:50,020
Okay.

1139
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:52,460
Sorry.

1140
01:29:56,180 --> 01:29:59,660
Don't yell at me like that again,
you scared the life out of me.

1141
01:30:10,180 --> 01:30:11,740
It's open.

1142
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,460
I was in the shower.
How'd it go?

1143
01:30:14,980 --> 01:30:16,980
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
No.

1144
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:19,940
Then it went very well.

1145
01:30:20,140 --> 01:30:22,540
Did it really go well?
Define your terms.

1146
01:30:22,940 --> 01:30:25,220
Do you feel good about it?
No.

1147
01:30:25,940 --> 01:30:27,620
Do others feel that you did well?
No.

1148
01:30:28,380 --> 01:30:31,180
Then what was good about it?
I lost six pounds...

1149
01:30:31,220 --> 01:30:34,380
Aaron, will you tell me?
It was great...

1150
01:30:34,660 --> 01:30:36,140
There I was...

1151
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:38,540
...writing my little first rate copy,

1152
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,940
...sitting on my jacket,
punching my one thought.

1153
01:30:42,700 --> 01:30:45,620
Except I had this historic
attack of flop sweat...

1154
01:30:45,660 --> 01:30:47,900
They'll never let me anchor again, ever.

1155
01:30:48,260 --> 01:30:51,220
Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads.
I think it drowned.

1156
01:30:51,620 --> 01:30:52,700
How was your evening anyway?

1157
01:30:52,740 --> 01:30:54,940
What do you mean, flop sweat?

1158
01:30:54,980 --> 01:30:58,380
You're making too much out of this.
I'll bet you were the only one aware of it.

1159
01:30:58,420 --> 01:30:59,620
People phoned in.

1160
01:30:59,660 --> 01:31:02,700
Stop kidding with me.
I want to know what happened.

1161
01:31:02,740 --> 01:31:03,740
I'm not kidding.

1162
01:31:04,260 --> 01:31:07,260
There were complaining phone calls
because you were sweating?

1163
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:10,660
No, nice ones worried that
I was having a heart attack.

1164
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:15,500
If all that happened,
how come you're so chipper?

1165
01:31:15,980 --> 01:31:18,060
I don't know.

1166
01:31:18,580 --> 01:31:22,100
At some point it was so off
the chart bad it got funny.

1167
01:31:22,700 --> 01:31:25,300
My central nervous system
was telling me something.

1168
01:31:25,340 --> 01:31:30,380
Jane, sweat running down my face,
makeup falling into my eyes...

1169
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:33,820
...people turning this fusillade
of blow dryers on my head...

1170
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:38,140
...all so I could read introductions to
other people who were covering stories...

1171
01:31:38,340 --> 01:31:41,620
...which is what I like to do anyway.
Yes.

1172
01:31:42,820 --> 01:31:45,060
And I'm chipper because
you finally showed up.

1173
01:31:46,020 --> 01:31:47,780
I'm gonna cook for us.

1174
01:31:49,460 --> 01:31:51,420
Tequila and eggs sound good?

1175
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,140
I have to be someplace.

1176
01:31:58,980 --> 01:31:59,820
Now?

1177
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:04,580
I told what's his name.
Tom, that I'd meet him.

1178
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:06,500
Call him up.

1179
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,580
It can wait, right?

1180
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,180
I don't know.

1181
01:32:17,220 --> 01:32:19,140
I may be in love with him.

1182
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,420
I knew it.

1183
01:32:25,460 --> 01:32:28,620
Get out of my house now.
I want you out of here.

1184
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,900
I'm not kidding.
Get out of here.

1185
01:32:32,660 --> 01:32:34,540
You go to hell.

1186
01:32:38,980 --> 01:32:40,860
Come back here. Come on.

1187
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,940
Don't go.
This is important to me.

1188
01:32:44,140 --> 01:32:46,020
I think it is important for you too.

1189
01:32:47,420 --> 01:32:50,460
Come on sit down.

1190
01:32:53,060 --> 01:32:54,460
Sit down.

1191
01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:21,380
What is this?
I'll take it.

1192
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:30,420
What?
Give me one minute please.

1193
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:31,980
This is tough.

1194
01:33:58,620 --> 01:33:59,820
Okay.

1195
01:34:00,660 --> 01:34:02,860
Let's take the part that
has nothing to do with me.

1196
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,580
Let me just be your
most trusted friend now,

1197
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:08,820
...the one that gets to say
all the awful stuff ok?

1198
01:34:10,220 --> 01:34:11,580
I guess.

1199
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:13,660
Yes.

1200
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:16,220
You can't end up with Tom...

1201
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,980
...because it totally goes against
everything that you're about.

1202
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:25,540
Yeah, being a basket case.

1203
01:34:27,380 --> 01:34:29,300
I know you care about him.

1204
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,740
I've never seen you
like this with anybody, so...

1205
01:34:33,780 --> 01:34:36,660
...don't get me wrong
when I tell you that Tom,

1206
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:39,220
very nice guy...

1207
01:34:40,780 --> 01:34:41,980
...is the Devil.

1208
01:34:43,980 --> 01:34:45,500
This isn't friendship.

1209
01:34:45,660 --> 01:34:46,900
You're crazy. You know that?

1210
01:34:46,940 --> 01:34:49,420
What do you think the job is
going to look like if he's around?

1211
01:34:49,460 --> 01:34:50,140
God.

1212
01:34:50,220 --> 01:34:53,860
Come on noone is going to be taken in
if he has a long, red, pointy tail.

1213
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:55,940
Come on. What's it gonna sound like...

1214
01:34:57,340 --> 01:34:58,220
No.

1215
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,900
I'm semi-serious here.

1216
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,820
You're serious...
He will be attractive...

1217
01:35:03,100 --> 01:35:05,100
...he will be nice and helpful...

1218
01:35:05,620 --> 01:35:09,700
...he will get a job where he influences
a great God-fearing nation...

1219
01:35:09,780 --> 01:35:13,940
...he'll never do an evil thing...
he'll never deliberately hurt a living thing

1220
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:18,860
...he'll just bit by little bit lower our
standards where they are important.

1221
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:23,660
Just a tiny little bit.
Just coax along flash over substance...

1222
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,980
Just a tiny little bit.

1223
01:35:26,660 --> 01:35:30,580
And he'll talk about
all of us really being salesmen.

1224
01:35:33,940 --> 01:35:36,420
And he'll get all the great women.

1225
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,500
Hey you.

1226
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:45,220
I think you're the Devil.
You know I'm not. -How?

1227
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:49,140
Because I think we have the kind of
friendship where if I were the Devil,

1228
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:51,140
...you will be the only one I would tell.

1229
01:35:51,900 --> 01:35:54,860
Well you were quick enough to get
Tom's help when...

1230
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,380
Yes.

1231
01:35:57,860 --> 01:36:01,340
I think if it's gone well for me tonight,
then I probably wouldn't say any of this.

1232
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,300
I grant you everything...

1233
01:36:04,020 --> 01:36:05,860
...but give me this...

1234
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:10,860
...he personifies everything that
you've been fighting against...

1235
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:14,180
...And I'm in love with you.

1236
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,380
How do you like that?

1237
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,700
I buried the lead.

1238
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:35,300
I've got to not say that aloud;
it takes too much out of me.

1239
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:44,660
I've never fought for anyone before.

1240
01:36:45,220 --> 01:36:47,780
Does anybody win one of these things?

1241
01:36:58,780 --> 01:37:00,980
Hello.
Hi.

1242
01:37:02,380 --> 01:37:03,500
Where are you?

1243
01:37:04,900 --> 01:37:07,980
I can't get away just yet.
I'm at Aaron's.

1244
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:10,820
Well, when?

1245
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:16,540
I'm not sure. It seems like he
had sort of a mishap on the news.

1246
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:19,420
I know. I taped it.

1247
01:37:19,700 --> 01:37:22,260
Well, it wasn't as bad as he think, was it?

1248
01:37:23,060 --> 01:37:25,980
It wasn't unprecedented or anything?

1249
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:28,500
Not if you count'Singing in the Rain. '

1250
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:33,820
Do him a favor and don't treat it like a
tragedy. You want me to talk to him?

1251
01:37:34,860 --> 01:37:37,300
He says you could hardly notice it.

1252
01:37:40,740 --> 01:37:41,900
I'll talk to him.

1253
01:37:43,460 --> 01:37:45,660
Don't say anything about anything.

1254
01:37:49,380 --> 01:37:50,580
Hi.
Hi.

1255
01:37:51,020 --> 01:37:54,940
sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize
you two would be going this late. Sorry.

1256
01:37:55,340 --> 01:37:58,260
Don't worry about it.
I'll put her back on.

1257
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:07,700
Hi again.

1258
01:38:08,980 --> 01:38:11,020
I'm sorry about this...

1259
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:12,660
No.

1260
01:38:13,180 --> 01:38:15,980
Don't worry. That sounds more important.

1261
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:20,860
Let's forget about tonight.

1262
01:38:22,860 --> 01:38:25,540
I don't know...

1263
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,980
...if that's absolutely necessary.

1264
01:38:28,380 --> 01:38:30,940
I've my father coming
through tomorrow anyway.

1265
01:38:30,980 --> 01:38:32,780
I should get some sleep.

1266
01:38:36,980 --> 01:38:38,660
I'll see you at the office.

1267
01:38:43,740 --> 01:38:44,940
Good night.

1268
01:38:48,740 --> 01:38:50,700
Hello?
Yes.

1269
01:38:53,380 --> 01:38:56,940
Okay. Good night.

1270
01:38:57,740 --> 01:38:59,580
Good night?

1271
01:39:01,340 --> 01:39:07,100
Jane, I'm not some chore you have
to finish so you can stay on schedule.

1272
01:39:08,060 --> 01:39:12,020
Okay, great, Grunick. Easy shots now huh?
Good night.

1273
01:39:21,540 --> 01:39:23,380
He just cancelled.

1274
01:39:26,660 --> 01:39:31,180
He had a chance to think and he cancelled.

1275
01:39:32,900 --> 01:39:34,220
I can't breathe.

1276
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:37,420
Damn it!

1277
01:39:38,580 --> 01:39:40,580
Oh what a guy.

1278
01:39:46,340 --> 01:39:49,740
Well, Jane, thanks for stopping by.

1279
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:01,860
Good night.

1280
01:40:40,100 --> 01:40:43,380
I kept trying to call you,
you never called me.

1281
01:40:43,620 --> 01:40:46,660
Were you just diddling me? Ýs that it?
I'm great if I'm helping your career.

1282
01:40:46,700 --> 01:40:49,780
But when I'm a woman for a second,
I get immediately fucked around by you.

1283
01:40:49,820 --> 01:40:51,740
Jane, this is my Dad.

1284
01:40:57,060 --> 01:41:00,820
I'm very pleased to meet you sir.
Please forgive what I said.

1285
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:03,660
I'm sorry.

1286
01:41:04,420 --> 01:41:07,060
You just light up a room and leave, huh?

1287
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:16,180
You want my opinion?

1288
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:18,500
The thing that's easy
to miss about Jane is...

1289
01:41:18,540 --> 01:41:21,500
You want my opinion?
And it's okay if you don't.

1290
01:41:22,180 --> 01:41:23,220
Yes, I would.

1291
01:41:23,940 --> 01:41:29,420
The way she just acted is not the
way an affectionate person acts.

1292
01:41:34,780 --> 01:41:36,140
Rorish.

1293
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:38,860
Just when do you start, telling people?

1294
01:41:39,020 --> 01:41:40,820
Almost immediately.

1295
01:41:40,860 --> 01:41:44,220
I'd like to take everyone out after
the show. -Fantastic.

1296
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,100
Hello Donny.
Bill, what a surprise.

1297
01:41:46,140 --> 01:41:47,300
Good to see you again.

1298
01:41:47,380 --> 01:41:49,900
Bill Rorich.

1299
01:41:53,900 --> 01:41:56,460
Bill, this is hard on all of us and...

1300
01:41:57,300 --> 01:41:59,100
...no time for compliments.

1301
01:41:59,140 --> 01:42:02,740
But I think it's extraordinary of
you to come down here for this.

1302
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:07,220
Well If we're not here for each other during
the tough time we're not a news organization

1303
01:42:07,540 --> 01:42:08,420
Bill.

1304
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,380
Welcome back to Washington. Bill.

1305
01:42:17,220 --> 01:42:18,620
Well, thank you.

1306
01:42:24,660 --> 01:42:27,260
I've forget is she on the list?

1307
01:42:29,220 --> 01:42:31,500
This is a brutal layoff...

1308
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:35,620
And all because they couldn't
program Wednesday nights.

1309
01:42:37,260 --> 01:42:38,540
You can make it a little less brutal...

1310
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:41,340
by knocking a million dollars
or so off your salary.

1311
01:42:46,820 --> 01:42:49,780
A bad joke. I'm sorry. Awful.

1312
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:51,540
It's a miserable day...

1313
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:56,020
...and that was just some kind of
sick-joke defense mechanism...

1314
01:42:56,100 --> 01:42:59,460
It just does not indicate
any of my feelings, not one...

1315
01:43:00,260 --> 01:43:04,100
...but just shows the kind of
stress this represents for all of us.

1316
01:43:07,220 --> 01:43:07,980
Bill.

1317
01:43:09,980 --> 01:43:12,300
Tom. It's about time.

1318
01:43:12,340 --> 01:43:14,220
It's good to see you.
Thank you.

1319
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:29,420
I feel terrible about what happened.

1320
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:32,860
What did he say?

1321
01:43:35,220 --> 01:43:36,420
He said...

1322
01:43:41,300 --> 01:43:42,980
...that he liked you...

1323
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:52,820
...because you looked like
you had fire and honesty.

1324
01:43:53,860 --> 01:43:55,180
No.

1325
01:43:56,300 --> 01:43:58,460
Did he really?
Yes.

1326
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:10,900
What?

1327
01:44:17,660 --> 01:44:19,460
Paul canned me.

1328
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:28,660
Well, my brother will feel great,
now he's not the only screw-up.

1329
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:30,820
Tom, Paul wants to see you.

1330
01:44:52,980 --> 01:44:55,580
Ernie. -What?
They're calling from work.

1331
01:44:55,980 --> 01:44:58,900
Tell them I'm on the way in.
It's Paul.

1332
01:45:23,420 --> 01:45:25,380
He'll just be in a minute.

1333
01:45:25,860 --> 01:45:28,380
I hate this so much.

1334
01:45:33,180 --> 01:45:39,140
You know I'm just old enough to be
flattered by the term,'early retirement. '

1335
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:43,100
That's wonderful. What a lovely line.

1336
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,940
Now if there's anything I can do for you.

1337
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:49,980
Well I certainly hope you die soon.

1338
01:45:54,580 --> 01:45:56,340
Tom.

1339
01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:11,380
This is a severe cutback, Tom.

1340
01:46:11,420 --> 01:46:16,660
27 people in this bureau alone
including technical personnel...

1341
01:46:16,740 --> 01:46:19,020
...and we're going to
reorganize at the same time.

1342
01:46:19,060 --> 01:46:22,940
We're going to drop you out of
Washington and assign you to London.

1343
01:46:25,900 --> 01:46:29,300
He knew that we're gonna offer
me this before ever when in there.

1344
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,060
I can't stand this.

1345
01:46:32,100 --> 01:46:35,660
This is not... -We careful each
other too much to be dishonest...

1346
01:46:35,700 --> 01:46:38,100
...so let me tell you the simple truth:

1347
01:46:38,140 --> 01:46:41,660
I'm leaving.
No matter who they replace me with here...

1348
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:43,740
or they're gonna make me leave anywhere...

1349
01:46:43,820 --> 01:46:45,460
...the fact that each you take some...

1350
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:52,540
...and I know you think
any better than I am.

1351
01:46:52,980 --> 01:46:55,180
Goddamn, no I'm not.

1352
01:46:58,780 --> 01:47:01,940
Oh my god. I'm gonna miss you.
Me too.

1353
01:47:04,660 --> 01:47:10,620
Have you guys seen Jane?
She's back there, getting my job.

1354
01:47:11,140 --> 01:47:14,180
The first woman bureau chief
we've ever had here.

1355
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:18,060
What did they do with you?

1356
01:47:20,380 --> 01:47:22,580
They booted me out of Washington.

1357
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:24,300
Impossible.

1358
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:28,540
There's no system that
wouldn't value one of us.

1359
01:47:29,220 --> 01:47:31,220
Why? What did they do to you?

1360
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:34,100
It's what he did.
I'm proud of him.

1361
01:47:34,300 --> 01:47:35,860
They told me they'd keep me...

1362
01:47:35,900 --> 01:47:39,940
...because they could plug me into
any story and my salary was in line.

1363
01:47:39,980 --> 01:47:43,860
The cost-efficient reporter.
So I quit.

1364
01:47:45,220 --> 01:47:48,780
Jane, I gotta tell you something.
Yeah?

1365
01:47:49,140 --> 01:47:51,140
Except for socially.

1366
01:47:51,460 --> 01:47:53,460
You're my role model.

1367
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:09,380
You packing up tonight?

1368
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:14,780
I'm sorry that they're sending you down
but I'm sure you'll make it back.

1369
01:48:14,820 --> 01:48:18,060
Where are they sending you anyway?
London.

1370
01:48:18,300 --> 01:48:20,380
London?

1371
01:48:20,420 --> 01:48:23,100
Yeah.
That's a promotion!

1372
01:48:23,140 --> 01:48:24,460
I don't think so.

1373
01:48:24,700 --> 01:48:28,860
Yes, that's where they had Rorish,
for God's sake, before they made him anchor.

1374
01:48:28,900 --> 01:48:31,140
I can't believe you.

1375
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:34,460
They're grooming you for it
all and you don't even know it.

1376
01:48:34,540 --> 01:48:36,420
Hold it down, will you?

1377
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,740
Can I ask you something?

1378
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:43,540
You only had one camera crew
on that date rape piece, right?

1379
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:45,860
Yeah.

1380
01:48:47,820 --> 01:48:49,660
You're not going to stick
around for the farewell party?

1381
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:52,860
No. I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be when Martin Klein...

1382
01:48:53,020 --> 01:48:57,020
...and Ernie turn off their
credentials with the security guard.

1383
01:48:57,060 --> 01:48:59,460
Hi...
Can I speak to your wife?

1384
01:49:00,460 --> 01:49:03,220
No message at all,
I'I see you at home.

1385
01:49:06,820 --> 01:49:09,700
This is one story they are not gonna cover.

1386
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:14,740
of course the network doesn't cover it
it must not be important so why worry.

1387
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,580
I'm going to miss you.

1388
01:49:19,940 --> 01:49:24,100
You're a prick in a great way.

1389
01:49:25,020 --> 01:49:28,940
You know what I mean.
No, I liked the way it made me sound.

1390
01:49:29,420 --> 01:49:34,020
Okay. Be good. See you.

1391
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:40,700
You figure out his hiring.

1392
01:49:43,060 --> 01:49:45,700
It's not... Donny.
Thank you, Jane.

1393
01:49:45,980 --> 01:49:48,340
Bye sweetie.
Good luck.

1394
01:49:49,700 --> 01:49:51,300
Oh sorry.

1395
01:49:54,340 --> 01:49:57,820
You know...
but I always wanted to tell you that...

1396
01:50:24,220 --> 01:50:27,140
...this is the third cutback...

1397
01:50:32,580 --> 01:50:34,380
These people...

1398
01:50:36,180 --> 01:50:38,260
This also awful.

1399
01:50:38,900 --> 01:50:43,660
It just hurts physically, doesn't it?

1400
01:50:43,860 --> 01:50:46,180
Like something's wrong with your bones,

1401
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:52,340
...like your organs are
shifting inside your body.

1402
01:50:57,140 --> 01:50:59,660
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.

1403
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:07,860
But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Congratulations? How can you say that to me?

1404
01:51:09,140 --> 01:51:13,820
I'm sorry I can't stand here
feeing bad because I don't feel worse.

1405
01:51:13,860 --> 01:51:16,660
This has happened
at every station I've ever been to.

1406
01:51:23,020 --> 01:51:26,500
Do they owe you any time off?

1407
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,060
Fourteen weeks.

1408
01:51:33,860 --> 01:51:38,740
I think it's crazy for you to come in here
tomorrow morning and start a new job.

1409
01:51:39,580 --> 01:51:43,180
I have a week before after I get to my job.

1410
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:47,540
Let's get the hell away
to some island fast and...

1411
01:51:49,340 --> 01:51:53,020
...and find out how we are
together away from this.

1412
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:04,540
Well, I just think...

1413
01:52:06,540 --> 01:52:10,460
...that's an extraordinary proposal.

1414
01:52:11,260 --> 01:52:12,740
That's yes?

1415
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:17,260
That's more than'yes'...

1416
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:23,620
...that's'you bet. '

1417
01:52:35,100 --> 01:52:36,340
Hello.

1418
01:52:36,380 --> 01:52:39,940
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
Speaking.

1419
01:52:39,980 --> 01:52:43,820
I just found out. You didn't say
anything to me? You just resign?

1420
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:47,540
Will you meet me now?
Oh, no, I can't. Maybe next week...

1421
01:52:47,580 --> 01:52:53,140
No, I'm going away tomorrow. Please.
Alright, I meet you the place in...

1422
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:54,700
Ok, I'll meet you there.

1423
01:52:58,740 --> 01:53:03,060
Anyway my agent has a hot prospect
the number two station in Portland.

1424
01:53:03,100 --> 01:53:07,740
The general manager there says he wants
to be every bit as good as the networks.

1425
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,300
Personally, I think he should aim higher.

1426
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:12,580
Tell me the God's honest truth...

1427
01:53:13,260 --> 01:53:16,260
...are you leaving because of me?
Because if you are...

1428
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:20,260
Ernie said you're lucky if you can
get out while you could still cry...

1429
01:53:20,940 --> 01:53:23,980
...which means I should have quit this place
three years ago.

1430
01:53:26,740 --> 01:53:32,700
You're just trying to say all great stuff so
I'll feel even worse that you're not around.

1431
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,860
Let's go.

1432
01:53:38,380 --> 01:53:41,420
I just want to sit here.

1433
01:53:49,140 --> 01:53:52,260
I mean the feeling stay here...

1434
01:53:53,020 --> 01:53:54,540
...that's powerful.

1435
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:58,940
Why is that?

1436
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:02,860
Maybe the best part of your life is over and
you dont wanna get up and start the bad part

1437
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:10,220
You are now required to sit here with me.

1438
01:54:11,380 --> 01:54:13,100
Come on.

1439
01:54:13,620 --> 01:54:16,860
...be smart for a second...
What do you...

1440
01:54:19,220 --> 01:54:21,140
...think will happen to us?

1441
01:54:21,220 --> 01:54:23,100
What will happen?

1442
01:54:23,620 --> 01:54:25,740
Okay, that's very easy.

1443
01:54:25,860 --> 01:54:29,180
Five, six years from now
I'll be in town to collect an award...

1444
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:33,060
...representing the surge in
foreign coverage by local stations.

1445
01:54:34,220 --> 01:54:36,500
What will they call you at work?

1446
01:54:36,540 --> 01:54:38,500
The...

1447
01:54:39,020 --> 01:54:39,820
Yes.

1448
01:54:39,860 --> 01:54:43,180
anyway I'll be walking with my wife
and two lovely children...

1449
01:54:43,300 --> 01:54:45,540
...and we'll bump into you

1450
01:54:46,660 --> 01:54:48,220
...and my youngest son will say something...

1451
01:54:48,260 --> 01:54:52,460
...and I will tell him it's not nice
to make fun of single, fat ladies.

1452
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:02,700
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?

1453
01:55:04,300 --> 01:55:05,820
I hope so.

1454
01:55:08,260 --> 01:55:10,380
No. I'm not really mad.

1455
01:55:11,660 --> 01:55:14,100
I'll miss you, we'll talk,
we'll always be friends...

1456
01:55:14,140 --> 01:55:19,300
...we'll get hot for each other every few
years at dinner and never act on it, okay?

1457
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:25,260
I gotta go.

1458
01:55:40,060 --> 01:55:41,380
Jane.

1459
01:55:42,460 --> 01:55:47,060
Do you know how Tom had tears in his eyes
in that interview we did with that girl?

1460
01:55:47,100 --> 01:55:49,180
Ask yourself how we were able to see that...

1461
01:55:49,220 --> 01:55:54,620
...when he only had one camera and that was
pointing at the girl during the interview.

1462
01:55:55,780 --> 01:55:58,460
I'm fairly sure I was right to tell you.

1463
01:56:30,620 --> 01:56:34,460
This whole thing just messed me up...

1464
01:56:36,940 --> 01:56:39,300
...maybe more than it should have...

1465
01:56:41,380 --> 01:56:42,980
I'm sorry.
Stand up.

1466
01:56:45,420 --> 01:56:48,900
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm sorry.

1467
01:56:48,980 --> 01:56:53,180
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
The way you were looking at me, I just went.

1468
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:56,220
Point just...

1469
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:00,860
I just need a minute more of your time,

1470
01:57:01,620 --> 01:57:05,380
so we can shoot from behind you towards me,
and, um...

1471
01:57:06,220 --> 01:57:08,940
...that way we have someplace to go when
we cut. And...

1472
01:57:08,980 --> 01:57:12,700
...I sit here, I nod my head, I look nerdy.

1473
01:57:15,380 --> 01:57:18,260
It kills me we didn't get you on camera.

1474
01:57:18,460 --> 01:57:21,940
It was so powerful seeing your reaction.
Really?

1475
01:57:21,980 --> 01:57:24,580
For a second there,
I thought you were gonna cry yourself.

1476
01:57:25,300 --> 01:57:27,060
That would have been something.

1477
01:57:28,620 --> 01:57:30,380
Give me a minute...

1478
01:57:34,580 --> 01:57:36,500
Fucking...

1479
01:57:46,380 --> 01:57:48,300
Oh, it's amazing.

1480
01:58:40,380 --> 01:58:46,340
Could you tell me where we can catch a bus
to Washington? Thank you very much.

1481
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:58,620
Look who's the organized one.

1482
01:58:58,660 --> 01:59:00,780
I've got everything.
I'm not going.

1483
01:59:10,180 --> 01:59:11,140
Why?

1484
01:59:11,940 --> 01:59:17,900
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview
with the girl. I know you...

1485
01:59:18,780 --> 01:59:22,140
...acted your reaction after the interview.

1486
01:59:34,380 --> 01:59:36,300
It's verboten, huh?

1487
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:42,740
I thought since
I almost did it the first time, but...

1488
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:48,020
...I get you.

1489
01:59:49,140 --> 01:59:52,340
That's not the reason you're not coming?
Of course it's the reason.

1490
01:59:52,380 --> 01:59:55,300
It's terrible what you did.
We disagree on how God-awful it was.

1491
01:59:55,340 --> 01:59:59,100
Why don't you come with me and we can
disagree and get a tan at the same time?

1492
01:59:59,220 --> 02:00:01,860
Jesus, if you're gonna be glib about this
I'm gonna lose it.

1493
02:00:01,940 --> 02:00:03,260
Jane, keep it down.

1494
02:00:03,900 --> 02:00:05,940
Jane...
I was up all night and...

1495
02:00:10,140 --> 02:00:12,580
It made me ill.

1496
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:15,100
That's better.

1497
02:00:15,700 --> 02:00:18,940
You could get fired for things like that.
I got promoted for things like that.

1498
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:21,860
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway.

1499
02:00:21,900 --> 02:00:23,700
You totally crossed the line between...

1500
02:00:23,740 --> 02:00:27,820
It's hard not to cross it; they keep
moving the little sucker, don't they?

1501
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:34,540
It just proves that the difference we...
This is a one-way argument. We've got 6 days

1502
02:00:34,580 --> 02:00:37,700
...if you go and we fight and
we hate it, we'll come home.

1503
02:00:37,740 --> 02:00:40,900
If you don't go? That's a much bigger deal.
I leave for London right after that.

1504
02:00:40,980 --> 02:00:43,740
So, it'd be very big deal if you stay...

1505
02:00:47,580 --> 02:00:51,420
The plane's boarding. You're
good at deadline. Here's your ticket.

1506
02:00:54,260 --> 02:00:59,900
It's amazing. You commit this incredible
breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nit...

1507
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:02,620
I'm giving you a hard time about nothing

1508
02:01:03,740 --> 02:01:06,740
Try and get this. When you edited that...

1509
02:01:06,780 --> 02:01:08,740
I'm leaving now.

1510
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:12,460
Gate 82.

1511
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,140
Good morning.
Good morning.

1512
02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,380
Dupont Circle, please.

1513
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:39,420
Don't take the beltway, because at this
time of day there's gonna be a...

1514
02:02:40,380 --> 02:02:42,580
...Go any way you want.

1515
02:02:56,820 --> 02:02:59,500
But New York Avenue's faster.

1516
02:03:07,140 --> 02:03:11,660
...when they told me
Bill had decided to retire...

1517
02:03:11,940 --> 02:03:14,380
...and offered me the Evening News,

1518
02:03:15,460 --> 02:03:18,340
...I thought it was the same kind of joke
we used to pull back at the station...

1519
02:03:18,420 --> 02:03:22,580
...turning off somebody's
prompter in the middle of a show.

1520
02:03:24,940 --> 02:03:28,620
But when they heard my reaction,
they thought I was kidding.

1521
02:03:28,780 --> 02:03:34,220
I told them I'd be their anchor but
I didn't want to be the Managing Editor...

1522
02:03:34,660 --> 02:03:39,580
...that there were people better qualified
than I to control the content...

1523
02:03:40,820 --> 02:03:43,980
...and if there weren't
we were all in trouble.

1524
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:51,460
And now to something more important...
I'd like to introduce my fiancee.

1525
02:03:51,700 --> 02:03:53,740
Lila?

1526
02:04:08,060 --> 02:04:11,220
Aaron.
Congratulations.

1527
02:04:13,140 --> 02:04:16,140
Lila, this is Aaron Altman.
Oh yes.

1528
02:04:16,180 --> 02:04:18,460
Oh, this kid...

1529
02:04:18,500 --> 02:04:22,060
...couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.
What's your name?

1530
02:04:22,260 --> 02:04:23,860
Clifford.

1531
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:26,500
Hey Cliff, do you know who this is?

1532
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:29,900
The big joke?

1533
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:33,580
I don't know.

1534
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:35,980
Do you know? Jane's down here.
No.

1535
02:04:36,020 --> 02:04:37,820
I'll take Cliff over to see you.

1536
02:04:37,940 --> 02:04:39,620
Can I come along?
Yeah.

1537
02:04:41,340 --> 02:04:43,940
I'll meet you back at the place. Is that ok?
You'll be okay.

1538
02:04:45,620 --> 02:04:50,820
Come on, we'll see Jane now...
The speech was magnificent.

1539
02:04:50,860 --> 02:04:53,060
Oh my, I forgot to say something about
your speech.

1540
02:04:53,100 --> 02:04:55,060
I appreciate it.

1541
02:04:55,860 --> 02:04:58,220
Tom, we're proud of you.
Thanks.

1542
02:05:00,460 --> 02:05:03,300
Hey guys.
Come over here.

1543
02:05:16,180 --> 02:05:19,180
Hey, what is this?
My life's rushing in front of my eyes.

1544
02:05:19,380 --> 02:05:21,620
Clifford come out of here,
I wanna show you something.

1545
02:05:22,900 --> 02:05:26,780
Clifford...
Come on. I wanna show you something.

1546
02:05:34,220 --> 02:05:37,540
A picnic?
I thought for ol' Cliff here...

1547
02:05:37,580 --> 02:05:40,340
...but who know about this.
It would be great...

1548
02:05:42,180 --> 02:05:43,660
So...

1549
02:05:43,740 --> 02:05:46,020
Yeah,... culture shock.

1550
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:51,220
You are more adorable than your pictures.
Look at you.

1551
02:05:52,380 --> 02:05:54,820
Look what I got for you Cliff.

1552
02:05:58,660 --> 02:06:01,740
That's terrific. Let me see it.
Come here.

1553
02:06:04,100 --> 02:06:06,980
Are you any closer to a decision?
I think so.

1554
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:12,460
Aaron, they've been talking to me
about being a Managing Editor. -Really?

1555
02:06:13,820 --> 02:06:16,780
I'm gonna take it.

1556
02:06:18,500 --> 02:06:22,020
A great surprise.
I didn't think we had a chance.

1557
02:06:22,660 --> 02:06:24,980
They told me you wanted to stay
in Washington.

1558
02:06:25,140 --> 02:06:26,980
Well...

1559
02:06:27,020 --> 02:06:32,100
...there's a guy,
but he says he'll fly up a lot.

1560
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:36,820
Well, we should talk. You have
time for dinner? Ý'd like you to meet Lila.

1561
02:06:36,860 --> 02:06:40,580
I'm sorry but I was looking forward to that,

1562
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,980
I'm going back in a few hours.

1563
02:06:46,540 --> 02:06:49,380
It's so good to see you.

1564
02:06:50,780 --> 02:06:52,740
It's nice to see you.

1565
02:06:52,780 --> 02:06:54,900
Congratulations on history's longest
winning streak.

1566
02:06:54,940 --> 02:06:58,140
If you ever get restless in Portland,
let me know.

1567
02:06:58,260 --> 02:06:59,980
Why?

1568
02:07:00,700 --> 02:07:01,980
Okay.

1569
02:07:03,460 --> 02:07:05,460
Bye... boss.

1570
02:07:11,020 --> 02:07:12,620
Hey Cliff.

1571
02:07:13,820 --> 02:07:15,140
Cliff.

1572
02:07:16,700 --> 02:07:18,620
Come on.

1573
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:27,740
So, who's the guy?

1574
02:07:28,020 --> 02:07:32,860
We met about three months ago.

1575
02:07:32,900 --> 02:07:35,420
He works at the surgeon general office.

1576
02:07:35,540 --> 02:07:37,700
He loves boating.

1577
02:07:37,740 --> 02:07:40,900
So, he's been getting me into water skiing.

1578
02:07:43,100 --> 02:07:46,420
I like it!
So, doll, what about you lately?

1579
02:07:49,020 --> 02:07:51,580
My wife got this new job...
