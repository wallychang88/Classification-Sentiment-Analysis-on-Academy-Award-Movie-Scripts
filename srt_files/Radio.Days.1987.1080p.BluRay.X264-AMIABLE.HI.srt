into our neighbors' house in Rockaway.

I can't hear it.
Find the radio and turn it on!

one show after another.

called The Masked Avenger,

93

and how it turned me to crime.

94

But first you have to meet me.

95
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,274
And my family.

96
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,821
There I am
in my Masked Avenger hat and goggles,

97
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,407
which I got off
my friend in a trade.

98
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,409
And then there were
my father and mother,

99
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,453
two people who could find
an argument in any subject.

100
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,538
Wait a minute!

101
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:57,249
You think the Atlantic
is a greater ocean than the Pacific?

102
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,835
No. Have it your way.
The Pacific is greater.

103
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,088
JOE: I mean,
how many people fight over oceans?

104
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,756
Then there was my Uncle Abe.

105
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:08,301
He kept bringing home fish from his friends
who worked at Sheepshead Bay.

106
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,720
Ceil, I'm home!

107
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,058
Ceil, I got fish.
I got great fish today.

108
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,310
What do we need more fish for?

109
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,603
JOE: And my Aunt Ceil,

110
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,357
who dreamed of a more exciting life than
having to fillet his flounder.

111
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,692
They're fresh fish!

112
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,402
He has friends at Oscar's Dock,

113
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,905
so he can't spend one day there where they
don't load him up with fish!

You don't like it,

00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,368
JOE: Next there was
Grandpa and Grandma.

116
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,788
Every morning he spent
a half hour packing her into her corset.

117
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,999
I'm pulling,
I'm pulling!

118
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,711
A woman in her 70's,
and her bosom is still growing!

119
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,422
JOE: Abe and Ceil's daughter
was Cousin Ruthie,

120
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:49,801
who entertained herself by
listening to the neighbors on the party line.

121
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,053
Mrs. Waldbaum's having her ovaries out!

122
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,221
Both, or one?

123
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,599
Get off the line, okay?

124
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:59,269
Stop listening in on my phone!
Stop snooping on us!

125
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,022
All right, all right!
Don't get your bowels in an uproar!

126
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,231
Nobody's snooping.

127
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:07,194
Oh, yeah? My wife hears her breathing.
And she giggles!

128
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:11,948
Hey, Waldbaum! You think we care
what goes on in your house?

129
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,617
Let them take her ovaries out!

130
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,619
What's it our business?

131
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,622
JOE: Mrs. Waldbaum had
a steel plate in her head.

132
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,041
It was said she couldn't
walk near magnets.

134
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,130

who only wanted to get married.

- Hey, Tess?
- Uh-huh?

138
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,390
Tess, I can't decide
if I should take my vacation

139
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,768
on a cruise or go to the mountains.

140
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,437
I mean, the men are
richer on a cruise,

141
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:45,023
but there's more of
them in the resorts.

142
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,274
What do you think, Tess?

143
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:48,401
Well, I met my husband
at a mountain resort,

144
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,278
so I advise you
to go on a cruise.

145
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,615
That's very funny.
Can we get back to my idea?

146
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:55,116
We buy cultured pearls.

147
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,162
We box 'em here in velvet, and we sell them
mail order. I can get a good price.

148
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,997
You were in jewelry.
It didn't work.

149
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,500
We got stuck with
the rhinestone earrings.

150
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,627
You don't have a business head.

151
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,546
We got stuck with
mail-order parts,

you tried seeds,
then you lost money selling greeting cards.

cards in the closet!

154

There aren't that many
sick people in America!

155
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,473
Forget it. I'll spend
the rest of my life at the job I do.

156
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,058
There's nothing wrong with it.

157

- None of your business.

158

what their dads do.

TESS: Pay attention to your school work,
and less to the radio!

You always listen to the radio.

164
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,575
It's different.
Our lives are ruined already.

165
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,286
You still have a chance
to grow up and be somebody.

166
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,371
Think I want you workin'
at the job I do?

167
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:42,747
I don't know what your job is.

168
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,124
You gotta get an education.

169
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,626
While I'm getting it,
can I get the ring?

170
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,962
We don't have money to waste.

00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,550
We'd like to save up,
maybe have another child.

173
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,428
Your father works all day
like a horse supporting everybody...

174
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,512
At what?

175
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,389
He's a big butter-and-egg man.

176
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,600
What do you mean,
our lives are ruined?

177
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,184
I didn't mean "ruined" ruined.

178
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,854
We're poor but happy.
But definitely poor.

179
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,106
Isn't this a beautiful sea bass?

180
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,233
Who wants to join me, hmm?

181
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,616
JOE: By now, you've probably guessed
that the Masked Avenger ring

182
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,242
meant a lot to me.

183
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,329
Well, it did.
Because they were gold and mysterious,

184
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,205
and they fit any finger.

185
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,377
The box top I already had, but the 15 cents
was hard to come by in those days.

186
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,171
I tried not thinking about it,

187
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,215
but it was very hard
to keep off my mind.

188
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,468
...and the masts and the sail.

189
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,555
You even have to work with the tweezers
to get some of the small stuff in.

190
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,015
I'll pass it around.

191
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,391
TEACHER: That was lovely, Evelyn.

192
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,478
Arnold, why don't you
show the class what you have?

193
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:48,188
Stand right over there.

194
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:50,231
I found this
on my parents' night table.

195
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,900
- That will be enough! Sit down!
- What did I do?

196
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:55,737
Put that thing
in your pocket and sit down!

197
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,616
Ross, you have something
suitable to show the class, don't you?

198
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,743
Very good.
Stand right here.

199
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:05,288
This is my Masked Avenger
secret-compartment ring.

200
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,290
It's very special to me...

201
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,584
JOE: Now, basically
I was an honest kid.

202
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,712
But there are some things in life
that are just too compelling.

203
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,591
That afternoon at Hebrew school,
a scheme occurred to me.

204
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:22,389
RABBI: Next week,
we are going to issue collection boxes.

205
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:26,851
And each of you
will be asked to go out in the street

206
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:34,025
and collect funds for the promotion
of a new state in Palestine.

207
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,361
Can you give
to the Jewish National Fund

208
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,029
to help us build
a homeland in Palestine?

209
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,823
Please? No?

210
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:42,075
How about you?
Can you give to the Jewish National Fund?

211
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,451
Can you help us?
Anything?

212
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,828
Hey, how about...

213
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,830
Can you? Can you?
No? Oh.

214
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,707
Give to the Jewish National Fund?

215
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,584
Hey, can you...
Excuse me, can you...

216
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,462
Give it to me.
Please. Thank you.

217
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,007
ANDREW: Guys, we got enough to get
the Masked Avenger rings

218
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,259
and an ice cream soda.

219
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,261
We gotta leave some for Palestine.

220
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:04,013
Why? It's all the way over in Egypt.

221
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,141
It's a sin.
What if the rabbi catches us?

222
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:08,810
He'll never find out.
Besides, I can handle him.

223
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,937
- You sure?
- Positive.

224
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,189

226
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:21,322
used to buy this Masked Avenger ring?

227
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,909
My heart is full of grief.
It swells with anguish!

228
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,120
- He'll pay back every cent.
- Yep.

229
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,246
Shut up.

230
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,039
I don't know what to do, Rabbi.

231
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,293
Every night he listens to the radio.
I can't keep him away.

232
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,880
I say, "Go to the beach,
play in the sun, get some fresh air."

The Shadow,
The Masked Avenger...

235
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,220
This is no good.
This boy needs discipline.

236
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,847
Radio... Tsk-tsk...

237
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,515
It's all right once in a while.

238
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,189
Otherwise it tends to induce bad values,
false dreams, lazy habits.

239
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,109
Listening to the radio, these stories
of foolishness and violence,

240
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,487
this is no way
for a boy to grow up.

241
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:03,740
You speak the truth,
my faithful Indian companion.

242
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,243
To a rabbi you say
"my faithful Indian companion"?

243
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,661
Hey, don't hit my son.

244
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,455
What kind of upbringing is this?

245
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,416
Look, I'll hit him,
but you don't hit him!

246
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,710
I said, I'll hit him!
You leave him alone!

247
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:18,338
No, I'll hit him!
You're too lenient!

248
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,840
Oh, I'm lenient?
What, that's lenient?

249
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,760
I am a faithful Indian?
Such an impertinence!

250
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,887
Rabbi, I will teach him some manners.

251
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:26,971
You and that radio!

252
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,556
- Think that's lenient?
- Enough, enough.

253
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,433
You'll hurt the boy.

254
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,187
JOE: And so that ended
my career in crime.

255
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,940
And I never did get
the Masked Avenger ring.

256
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,734
But to this day
I still get chills

257
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,903
when I recall
his famous sign-off.

Turn it up.

What's the fuss?

268
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,766
Mr. Manulis finally asked her out.

269
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,059
What'd he do, go blind?

270
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,270
Him with the insults, right?
Hey!

I'll tell her.

00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,567
Mrs. Waldbaum
found a pocketbook in the subway

274
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,152
and she doesn't think
she's gonna give it back.

275
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,737

to stop listening.

Oh, God, he's so handsome!

278
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,661
I waited so long!
I never thought he'd ask me!

279
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,454
- Where'd you meet?
- In the Catskills.

280
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,083
He rides horseback,
he dances, he's some tennis player!

roller-skated in her life,

324
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,602
in his capable hands,
she did her best.

325
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,105

326

she was shy about having to wear glasses,

327

and kept trying
to hide the fact that she needed them.

Aunt Bea was really
developing a crush on Mr. Manulis.

it would have been impossible to guess

00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,656
You won't believe this,
but we're out of gas.

342
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,324
Oh, gosh.

343
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:19,287
Wouldn't you know it? Right out here on
the tip of Breezy Point, too.

344
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,166
Looks like we're stuck here.
At least till the fog lifts.

345
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,127
Oh, well, what's a girl to do?

346
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:36,137
BEA: Oh, Sidney!
Sidney, this is our first date together.

347
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,765
SIDNEY: Aw, Bea,
you know how I feel about ya.

ANNOUNCER OVER RADIO:
We interrupt with a special news bulletin.

349
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:45,021
A state of emergency has been declared
by the president of the United States.

350
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,482
We go live to Wilson's Glen,
New Jersey,

351
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:50,109
where the landing of hundreds
of unidentified spacecraft

352
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:55,031
has now been officially confirmed as a
full-scale invasion by Martians.

354

in their efforts to escape.

The power lines are down everywhere.

356
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,795
We could be cut off at any minute.

357
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:10,588
Oh, my gosh!

358
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,508
There's another group of spaceships,

359
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,968
of alien ships,
coming out of the sky...

360
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,887
JOE: Despite his bravado all evening,

361
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,890
Mr. Manulis panicked
and bolted out of the car.

362
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:25,353
He was so frightened by the reports of
interplanetary invasion that he ran off,

363
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,523
leaving Aunt Bea to contend
with the slimy green monsters

364
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:31,526
he expected to drop
from the sky at any moment.

365

She walked home.
Six miles.

366
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:37,240
When Mr. Manulis called
for a date the next week,

367
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:41,410
she told my mother to say she couldn't see
him. She had married a Martian.

368
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:52,547
Now earlier, I promised
some inside stories about the stars.

369
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,551
Here's a little something
that actually happened one night

370
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:58,427
with Roger and Irene.

371
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,680
Everyone's here tonight, sweetheart.

372
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,889
Isn't that Richard?

373
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,725
Oh, Richard?
We saw that show at the Morosco.

374
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,060
You're right, it's terrific.

375
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,895
Thank you.

376
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,148
I thought I saw Ernest Hemingway
at the bar.

377
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,233
Well, I heard he was
in town, angel, yes.

378
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,695
- Cigars? Cigarettes?
- I'll have some Camels.

379
00:19:15,737 --> 00:19:17,738
Oh, hello, Mr. Daly.

380
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:21,075
Where have you been?
I can never get hold of you.

381
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,743
I told you it was over.

382
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,911
Please don't say that!

383
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,581
Listen, you call me
all hours! I meet...

384
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:31,127
I meet you in hotel rooms,
in the back of cars, in stalled elevators...

385
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:33,129
You're gonna lose
your respect for me.

386
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,089
Please, don't be unreasonable.

387
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,141
Cigars? Cigarettes?

388
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:48,936
Cigar, please.

389
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,106
Thank you very much.

390
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,696
Sally, you can't break it off now.
I'm in love with you.

391
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,617
Yeah. If you loved me,
you'd leave your wife and marry me.

392
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,036
I can't do that.
Our ratings are too high.

I want you, Sally.
I... I crave you.

398
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,516
I spoke to the head
of the agency about you.

399
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,684
He wants to meet you.

400
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:10,810
Really?

401
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,395
I told him

402
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:15,690
you were the most
promising young actress I'd seen in years.

403
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,733
But you've never
even seen me act.

404
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,610
I've got great intuition.

405
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:23,197
I care so much about you.
I've just got to have you, Sally.

406
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,783
I'm... I'm exploding with desire.

407
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:29,537
Well, I...
We can't do it now. I'm working my shift.

be alone for a few minutes.

to have a drink with Richard Rodgers.

spent her time drinking and hobnobbing

416
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:57,565
with society's
most interesting and exotic Latin playboy.

417
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:12,079

came up here with anybody but you.

how it happened.

said that Irene came up to the roof

with the same intention
as her husband,

452
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,079
and that Sally got fired.

were so sophisticated

00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:23,252

00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,202
What'd you do there
for over an hour?

509
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,204
I talked. Or rather I listened.

510
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,040
- Hey, you didn't eat?
- I did eat.

511
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,583
Abe, we're fasting!

512
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,501
They're right!
It's silly!

513
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,628
Oh, my God, Abe!

514
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,130
I should fast to atone for my sins?

515
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,883
What are my sins?
Who did I bother?

516
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:19,553
The only sin is the exploitation
of the worker by the bosses.

517
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,847
Did the daughter get hold of you?

518
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,893
See, the problem is not between man
and some imaginary super being,

519
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,813
it's between man and the owners of 90
percent of the world's wealth.

520
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,900
What do you mean,
"Some imaginary super being"?

521
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,234
You don't believe in God?

522
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:36,403
Religion is the opium of the masses.

523
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,113
Abe, God will punish you!

524
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:41,659
No. God is not interested in me.

525

528
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,957
- Chest pains.
- Abe, really?

Abe, are you all right?

530
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,211
- I can't breathe.
- No, stop it.

00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,587
Just relax.
Just relax.

532
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,755

Abe, I told you
God would punish you.

534
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,885
I'll get the doctor's number.

535
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,388
Maybe it's indigestion.
What did you eat there?

536
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,723
- Uh, some pork chops.
- Pork chops?

537
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,893
And some clams.
And chocolate pudding.

538
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,228
Abe, how could you do this?

539
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,688
And French fries.

540
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,315
You won't eat
my French fries,

541
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,317
but you eat the commies' French fries?

542
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:16,860
I'm gonna get him
some bicarbonate.

This has been Bill Kern
with another favorite sports legend.

JOE: While Uncle Abe loved
the Bill Kern sports show,

582

his wife Ceil adored
a very prominent ventriloquist,

used to drive Abe crazy.

Ruthie had her own favorite program.

Naturally it was one
of those romantic boy crooners.

591

used to sit and swoon endlessly

The local boys, of course,
were all a little jealous,

look on disgustedly,

stick a knife in here?

your acquaintance.

who I had a crush on,
but who didn't like me.

was popular,

I remember a strange little event.

00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,246
My friend Andrew and I
built a snowman outside the school.

I remember when I first heard that song.

697
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:47,222
I always associate
its popularity with a bizarre incident,

00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:50,684
when Mr. Zipsky,
normally a very quiet man,

of Aunt Ceil's favorite show.

00:46:54,102 --> 00:47:00,733
No, sirree

853
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,236

Pearl Harbor

855
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:13,329
JOE: My friends and I, acting on advice
from the radio G-man Biff Baxter,

856
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,249
collected scrap iron
every day after school.

857
00:47:16,542 --> 00:47:20,503
Our local soda jerk, Rita, joined the WACs
and looked good in uniform.

858
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:24,549
And Mrs. Riley had
a victory garden in her flowerpots.

859
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,593
On the radio, stories changed.

860
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,513
Now the Japanese and Germans
were the villains.

861
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,098
MAN 1 ON RADIO:
"Okay, you Axis rats!

862
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,476
"I know you got submarines
sneaking around our coast!"

863
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,936
MAN 2: "We have no submarines."

864
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,272
"Yes, you do!
U-boats and airplanes!

865
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,317
"But we Americans are always
on the lookout, always alert! Take that!"

866
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:44,944
(FIGHTING NOISES)

867
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,115
"Okay, I think you've
learned your lesson.

868
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,784
"One American with courage
is worth 20 of you!

869
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,746
"Come along. Uncle Sam knows
what to do with Axis rats."

870
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:58,624
JOE: My friends and I
hung on Biff Baxter's every word.

871
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,502
When he said to watch
for enemy planes

872
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:04,088
and submarines
lurking off the coast,

873
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,966
our parents laughed.
But we took it seriously.

874
00:48:07,134 --> 00:48:08,634
JOE: Remember,
if we see any German planes,

875
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,137
I do have a number to call, okay?

876
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,805
Oh, look at that.

877
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,807
Hey, look, there's one!

878
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,310
NICK: No, no,
that's one of ours.

879
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,563
I don't think the Germans
can get over here so easy.

880
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:24,025
They can! The Masked Avenger
says they're working on rockets!

881
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,027
Hey, look, a Japanese bomber!

882
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,321
- Let me see!
- Get off.

883
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:31,240
Hey, wow!
Look in that window!

884
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:32,950
(BABALU PLAYING)

885
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,665
NICK: Let me see!
Let me see!

886
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,000
BURT: What do you see?

887
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,336
Jesus, what legs!

888
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,963
Hey, it's my turn!

889
00:48:50,469 --> 00:48:53,304
Jungle drums were madly beating

890
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:57,725
In the glare of eerie light

891
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,561
While the natives kept repeating

892
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:04,148
Ancient jungle rites

893
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,694
All at once the dusky warriors began to

894
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:10,529
Raise their arms to skies above...

895
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,698
Oh, God, I can hardly breathe!

896
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,160
And the native then stepped forward
to chant to

897
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:18,788
His voodoo goddess of love

898
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,542
Ah, great Babalu

899
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,796
I'm so lost and forsaken

900
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:31,968
JOE: Later that afternoon,

901
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,387
we all walked down
to the water's edge.

902
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,224
The talk had shifted away
from Nazis to more important matters.

903
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,392
JOE: Boy, she was pretty.

904
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,227
ANDREW: She was nothin' special.

905
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,730
She was all right.
But my favorite is Rita Hayworth.

906
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:46,232
I like Betty Grable.

907
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:48,025
NICK: I like Dana Andrews.

908
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,735
You kidding?
Dana Andrews is a man.

909
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:50,820
She is?

910
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,863
Didn't you ever see Crash Dive?

911
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,865
With a name like Dana?

912
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:57,743
ANDREW: Say, guys,
wanna look for planes?

913
00:49:57,828 --> 00:49:59,078
DAVE: I'm going home.

914
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:02,289
I'll come with you.
Let's go listen to the radio.

915
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,421
JOE: I didn't care
if the guys went home.

916
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,090
I was in a funny mood
that afternoon.

917
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:14,552
I just stood there,
looking out at the Atlantic.

918
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:18,180
My mind was thinking
about life, and women,

919
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,057
and a million different things.

920
00:50:20,934 --> 00:50:23,769
And then suddenly I saw it.

921
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,606
It was just like
Biff Baxter described it.

922
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:31,610
It came up and went under
so mysteriously and silently

923
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,988
that I couldn't
believe my eyes.

924
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,116
I never told anyone
about it afterward

925
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,744
because I doubted
my own experience.

926
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,748
Besides, I knew that
no one would believe me.

927
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:47,585
No one except Biff Baxter.

928
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,473
(SINGING) They're either too young
or too old

929
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:05,311
They're either too gray
or too grassy-green

930
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:09,440
The pickin's are poor
and the crop is lean

931
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,567
What's good
is in the army

932
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,778
What's left
will never harm me

933
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,990
They're either too old
or too young

934
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:22,036
So, darling
you'll never get stung

935
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:26,290
Tomorrow I'll go hiking
with that eagle scout unless

936
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:31,545
I get a call from Grandpa
for a snappy game of chess

937
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,800
TESS: What are you doin'?

938
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,512
I'm outta nylons.
But lots of girls paint them on now.

939
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,888
Better hope it doesn't rain.

940
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,348
Oh, right.

941
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,975
Oh, I really think
this could be the one.

942
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:46,477
I hope so.

943
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:50,439
He's so good-looking,
he's good-natured, he has his own business.

944
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,233
And his fiancée died last year,

945
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,360
so he's obviously
marriage-minded.

946
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,612
How come he's not
in the army?

947
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:59,990
He has flat feet.
But that's his only drawback.

948
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:03,369
You really think
you could love a man with fallen arches?

949
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:05,538
I know, you think
I'm too demanding.

950
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,707
I do. You have these
qualities you demand,

951
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:12,294
and when you meet a nice man you
disqualify him for the smallest fault.

952
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,379
That's not true.

953
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,589
So what was wrong
with Nat Bernstein?

954
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,175
He wore white socks with a tuxedo.

955
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,386
That's not a good enough reason.

956
00:52:20,428 --> 00:52:24,431
Then when you fall in love there's
always something wrong with him.

957
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,767
You know, they all seem fine.

958
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:31,063
I don't know.
You got this sixth sense for picking losers.

959
00:52:31,148 --> 00:52:34,316
Sometimes I wonder,
do you really wanna get married?

960
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:35,901
More than anything.

961
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,946
Don't you think
I wanna have a child before it's too late?

962
00:52:39,030 --> 00:52:42,575
God, how I envy you.
I just want it to be perfect.

963
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:46,162
It's never perfect. If you wait for
perfect, you don't get pregnant,

964
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:48,455
you wind up
with your teeth in a glass of water.

965
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,625
Easy for you to say.

966
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,753
I compromised
when I picked Martin.

967
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:58,757
I mean, I wanted
someone tall and handsome and rich.

968
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:00,759
Three out of three, I gave up.

969
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,304
I think you did right
to compromise.

970
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:06,515
Why? You don't think
I could've done better than Martin?

971
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:10,394
I know. You could've married Sam Slotkin.
So why didn't you?

972
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,563
Oh, Sam Slotkin
was a mortician.

973
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,274
He always smelled
from formaldehyde.

974
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,652
And don't think that Martin
didn't compromise with me.

975
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,906
He always dreamed of being
a business tycoon,

976
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,283
having a beautiful blonde wife.

977
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:28,204
I tell him the day
he becomes a tycoon I'll dye my hair.

978
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,539
Well, at least
you have each other.

979
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,625
That's all I want, someone.

980
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:35,628
So you have to lower
your standards a little.

981
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,965
You know,
marrying for love is a very recent idea.

982
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,968
In the old country,
they didn't marry for love.

983
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:46,430
A man married a woman
because he needed an extra mule.

984
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:51,977
But you're the one that listens
to all the romantic soap operas.

985
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:54,146
Well, I like to daydream.

986
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:57,566
But I have my two feet firmly planted
on my husband.

987
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,444
First we'll go to the movie,

988
00:54:00,487 --> 00:54:03,280
then eat, then maybe
I'll ask him back here.

989
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,950
Although I don't wanna
seem too forward.

990
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:07,952
Hey, you really
like this guy, huh?

991
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:09,995
Oh, I like him so much.

992
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,331
We'll say a prayer for you.

993
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:16,085
And then, maybe this time next year,
you'll look like me.

994
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:18,712
(GIGGLES)

995
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,842
- You know what I was thinkin', Tess?
- What?

996
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,886
I could learn engraving,
buy a machine.

997
00:54:25,971 --> 00:54:27,721
Not another get-rich scheme!

998
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,683
I could make a few dollars engraving.

999
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:32,893
- Let me tell you the beauty part.
- Yeah? I'm waiting.

1000
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:35,229
When you engrave
gold rings and lockets,

1001
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:38,774
what you cut out when
you make the letters falls on the table.

1002
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,900
It's gold dust.

1003
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,986
Forget it. It'll be like
all the other ideas.

1004
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,655
Gold dust, and the engraver owns it!

1005
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,198
Hold my wool.

1006
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,118
If it's a girl,
we could name it Lola.

1007
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,577
Lola? You want her
to be a stripper?

1008
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,037
And if it's a boy, Lionel?

1009
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:54,123
No son of mine
will be named Lionel.

1010
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,791
I want an L name,
after my Uncle Louie.

1011
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,419
Your Uncle Louie.
How about "louse"?

ANNOUNCER OVER RADIO:
The news is not good tonight.

Reports are that
Nazi tank divisions

00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:06,969
are pushing American infantrymen back
in furious armored warfare.

1015
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:12,016
Meanwhile, Japanese have taken control of
two more islands in the Philippines

1016
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,268
and are advancing
on American...

1017
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:19,064
This is John Jenkins
broadcasting from London.

would be better off without any of 'em.

To settle a war, the leaders
involved should meet in a stadium

It's just that
every time I hear that song on the radio,

1061

my memory goes back to Leonard.
That was our song.

1190
01:05:18,789 --> 01:05:22,334
I figured if I carried it,
I could keep the cab fare.

1191

The first half mile
was barely manageable.

1192

Pretty soon I realized
I'd have to give in

gonna save any money.

out what my father did for a living.

1199
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,585
For some strange reason,
he was ashamed of it.

1200

Even then, he didn't admit it.

1201

one bit though.
