1
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:46,838
Garbage....

2
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,967
All l've been thinking about
all week is garbage.

3
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,177
l mean, l just can't stop thinking about it.

4
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,264
What kind of thoughts about garbage?

5
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,724
l just...

6
00:00:57,808 --> 00:01:02,395
l've gotten real concerned over
what's gonna happen with all the garbage.

7
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,647
l mean, we've got so much of it.

8
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,819
You know, I mean, we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually.

9
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:17,744
The last time l started feeling this way
is when that barge was stranded

10
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,497
and, you know, it was going around
the island, and nobody would claim it.

11
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:24,709
-Do you remember that?
-Yes, l remember.

12
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:30,590
Do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern?

13
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,383
Yeah. Yeah.

14
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:37,096
You see, the other night
John was taking out the garbage,

15
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,266
and he kept spilling things
out of the container.

16
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,438
And that made me... l started imagining,

17
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:49,317
like, a garbage can that produces garbage,

18
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,778
and it doesn't stop.
lt just keeps producing garbage,

19
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,488
and it just keeps overflowing.

20
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:57,658
And what would you do, you know,
to try to stop something like that?

21
00:01:59,703 --> 00:02:02,079
And do you see any pattern here?

22
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:06,459
-What do you mean?
-Well...

23
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,878
Last week we were talking
about your obsession

24
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,880
with the families of airline fatalities.

25
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,759
Now, we're talking about your concern
over the garbage problem.

26
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,303
Yeah. So?

27
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,013
Well, if you think about it,

28
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:23,392
l think you'll see that the object
of your obsession is invariably

29
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,146
something negative
which you have no control over.

30
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,941
Yeah.

31
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:32,652
But how many people, do you think,
run around

32
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:37,323
obsessing over how great and how happy
things are? You know, l mean...

33
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,743
Maybe they do,
but l don't think they're in therapy.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,287
Anyway,

35
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:47,375
being happy isn't all that great.

36
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,837
l mean, the last time l was really happy

37
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:52,839
l got so fat.

38
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:55,258
l must have put on 25 pounds.

39
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,095
l thought John was gonna have a stroke.

40
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:04,016
So what are you worried about?

41
00:03:04,101 --> 00:03:07,228
What am l looking at here?
ls this a mistake or what?

42
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:10,523
lt depends on your point of view.
l don't think so.

43
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:12,441
ln fact, l'm gonna tell you a little secret.

44
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,110
Yeah?

45
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,112
As soon as you've got a ring on your finger,

46
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:20,074
you start getting the most spectacular
attention from the opposite gender.

47
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:21,909
-That's bullshit.
-Seriously.

48
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:24,871
God, l wish l had Super Bowl seats
for every time some filly would come up

49
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,207
and start talking to me
without the slightest provocation.

50
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,334
lt's critical. lt's just marvellous.

51
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,128
Yeah, but that happened to you
before you got married.

52
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,881
No! No, no, no, no.
lt never happened before l got married.

53
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,799
lf l'd known that, l'd have gone out
and bought myself a ring

54
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:39,343
when l was 1 8 and saved myself...

55
00:03:39,428 --> 00:03:42,305
-Yeah, right.
-...a lot of time and money.

56
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,473
No, l wish somebody had clued me in.

57
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:48,144
l'm telling you. lt's too weird.

58
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:52,106
Shit, l gotta be someplace.
So, listen, racquetball Thursday, right?

59
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,858
-How about 7:30?
-Yeah, fine.

60
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,693
-Great. Bye-bye.
-See you later. Bye.

61
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:04,702
-Yes, sir?
-Janet.

62
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:09,957
Reschedule Kirkland for Friday, 1 :30.

63
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:12,001
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

64
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,762
Are you still keeping these thoughts
from John?

65
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,805
Yeah.

66
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,099
Well, are you afraid of his reaction

67
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,644
of his finding you silly
at thinking these things?

68
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,938
No, it's not that. lt's just...

69
00:04:32,022 --> 00:04:34,815
-Well, l'm really angry at him right now.
-Why?

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,693
Well, he invited this college friend of his
to come stay at our house,

71
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,446
and, well, he didn't even ask me.

72
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,573
l'm gonna say yes, of course,

73
00:04:42,658 --> 00:04:46,869
but, you know, it just would have been nice
to have been asked.

74
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,413
What upset you about that?

75
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,961
l guess it makes me angry
because l can't justify being angry.

76
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:57,964
lt's his house. He pays the mortgage.

77
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:02,426
Yes, but he asked you to quit yourjob,
and you do have housework.

78
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,805
Yeah. l have housework. That's true.

79
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,683
Now, this unexpected guest
notwithstanding,

80
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,977
how are things with John?

81
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,979
They're fine. l mean, they're fine.

82
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,522
Except for l'm kind of
going through this thing

83
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,774
where l don't want him to touch me, but...

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:21,070
Well, when did you begin
having this feeling?

85
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:23,864
Well, last week.

86
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:25,658
l don't know. l just...

87
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:30,454
l got this really strange feeling

88
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:33,332
and just didn't want him to touch me.

89
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:35,001
Prior to this feeling,

90
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,921
were you comfortable
with your physical contact with John?

91
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,549
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

92
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,430
Except for... Well...

93
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:50,683
l've never really been that much into sex.

94
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:56,147
l mean, l like it and everything,
but, you know,

95
00:05:56,231 --> 00:06:00,860
l just don't think it's such a big deal,

96
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,697
and l wouldn't miss it,
you know, kind of thing.

97
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,365
But...

98
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:12,038
Well, lately l've just been kind of curious
about how things have slacked off.

99
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:17,084
Well, perhaps he senses your hesitancy
at being touched.

100
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:19,879
Yeah, but, you see, that's the weird thing,

101
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:24,550
because he started not touching me
before l started feeling like that.

102
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,891
l mean, l'm sure he probably wishes
that l would initiate things once in a while.

103
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,478
And l would, except for...

104
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:38,481
lt just never occurs to me and...

105
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:42,610
Well, the few times l have felt like it,
l was by myself.

106
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,988
Did you do anything?

107
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,743
What do you mean?

108
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,661
Did you masturbate?

109
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,256
God, no!

110
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:06,592
No.

111
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:12,014
l take it from your response
that you never masturbate.

112
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:18,729
Well...

113
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:23,734
l tried once. lt just seemed so stupid.

114
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,321
l don't know.

115
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,699
lt just seemed like a dumb thing to do.

116
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,368
God, you know, then l started worrying

117
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,830
that my dead grandfather was maybe
watching me, you know, and...

118
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,709
lt just seemed so stupid.

119
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:43,504
You know, especially when you don't know
what to do with all the garbage.

120
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,465
So it was recently when you tried this?

121
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:52,555
Well, it was kind of recently,
but not real recently.

122
00:07:56,852 --> 00:08:00,813
l am just not up to having
a guest in the house.

123
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:09,613
l gotta go to the office.

124
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,532
l gotta get back to the office.

125
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:17,163
l only get one today? Gee, how exciting.

126
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,707
l already skipped one meeting.
l gotta get back.

127
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:26,338
Look, John, if you wanna leave, leave.

128
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:29,925
My life doesn't revolve
around these little get-togethers.

129
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,219
l mean, don't flatter yourself.

130
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:37,308
Hey, don't feel like you gotta treat me
with kid gloves, Cyn.

131
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,310
l mean, tell me how you really feel.

132
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,813
Listen, l got a friend coming into town,

133
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:46,734
an old friend of mine
that l haven't seen in years.

134
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,280
From what l can tell, l think he's a little lost.

135
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,451
l think l may have to spend
a little time with him.

136
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,871
Meaning we'll have to cool it for a while?

137
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,916
Yeah.

138
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,881
You know, l wish you'd quit
that bartending job of yours.

139
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,382
Why?

140
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,802
l just hate the thought
of all those guys hitting on you.

141
00:09:15,597 --> 00:09:19,141
-l can handle it.
-l'm sure.

142
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:24,063
Besides, the money is good
and some of the guys are cute.

143
00:09:24,147 --> 00:09:26,732
And you are in no position to be jealous.

144
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:30,277
Who said l was jealous?

145
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:32,363
l did.

146
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,578
You know,
l'd like to do it at your house sometime.

147
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:43,374
l must admit,
the idea of doing it in my sister's bed

148
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,501
gives me a perverse thrill.

149
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:56,095
l wish l could just come right out
and tell everyone Ann's a lousy lay,

150
00:09:56,179 --> 00:10:00,933
the beautiful,
the popular Ann Bishop Mullany.

151
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,645
Could be risky.

152
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,190
How about l just start a rumour, then?

153
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,527
No, no. l mean, doing it at my house.

154
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,447
-Afraid of getting caught?
-Yeah.

155
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,491
You should be.

156
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:23,372
-Can l meet this friend of yours?
-Who? Graham?

157
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,250
l gotta tell you, we were very close
many years ago, but l...

158
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,546
l think we're very different now.

159
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,496
-Yes?
-Ann? My name is Graham Dalton.

160
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,831
Yeah.

161
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,958
-Sure.
-May l use your bathroom?

162
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,585
Come on in. Come on.

163
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:17,384
-Where is it?
-Straight back there to the left.

164
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:20,012
-l'm sorry.
-Do you like strawberries? l brought you...

165
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:23,182
-Thank you. That's real sweet.
-...some strawberries.

166
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:44,078
Hi. John Mullany, please. This is his wife.

167
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,459
That's all right. Thank you.

168
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,548
Well...

169
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:58,926
-That was quick.
-False alarm.

170
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,427
Have a seat.

171
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,143
l'm sorry. You know,
we don't let people smoke in the house.

172
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,229
-But if you'd like to, we could...
-Oh, no, no, no.

173
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,689
-...go outside.
-l...

174
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,691
l can wait.

175
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,571
-Do you have any other things?
-Yes.

176
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:22,241
You mean to bring in? No, no.

177
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:26,578
l mean, l do have some other things,
but this is all l need to stay here.

178
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,916
Have you ever been on television?

179
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:37,339
Television? No. No. Why? Why?

180
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,509
l was just curious.

181
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,100
Graham. That's an unusual name.

182
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:51,478
Yeah, yeah. l guess it is.

183
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:55,357
My mother is a complete Anglophile.

184
00:12:56,526 --> 00:13:00,571
Anything British makes her drool
like a baby, so she...

185
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,282
l think she heard the name in a movie
or something.

186
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,868
She's a prisoner of public television now.

187
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:08,370
How do you like being married?

188
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,583
l like it just fine.

189
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,335
What about it do you like?

190
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,296
l don't mean to be critical.

191
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,673
-No, no. That's okay.
-l'm curious.

192
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:28,015
Well, you know the cliché
about the security of it.

193
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,726
Well, that's true.

194
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,521
And we own this house.

195
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,858
lt's a nice house.

196
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:40,235
And...

197
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,072
John was just made junior partner,
and l really like that.

198
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:49,244
You know, l like the fact that
he's just not freelance or whatever.

199
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:51,288
Yes.

200
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:59,421
So how long has it been
since you've seen John?

201
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,964
-Nine years.
-Nine years?

202
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:06,345
Yeah. l was surprised he invited me
to stay here until l found a place.

203
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:07,846
Didn't you...

204
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,225
-Didn't you know him very well?
-No. l knew him very well.

205
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:12,809
John and l

206
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,271
were very much alike.

207
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:18,023
Really?

208
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:23,862
lt's kind of hard to believe.
l mean, you just seem so different now.

209
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:30,369
Yeah. l would imagine
we are pretty different now.

210
00:14:31,621 --> 00:14:35,290
-l'm ready to use the bathroom finally.
-Okay.

211
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:51,598
Graham,

212
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,018
l gotta tell you,

213
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,979
l almost called the cops
when l saw you today.

214
00:14:57,063 --> 00:15:01,942
l thought to myself,
"This couldn't possibly be the same guy

215
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:06,363
"that once held private services
in the back of the chapel on a weekly basis."

216
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,532
-You did that?
-Well, yeah.

217
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:11,577
Everybody has a past, and that's mine, so...

218
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,662
So what's with the getup?

219
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:16,498
Somebody die or...

220
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,458
-John.
-l'm sorry. Did...

221
00:15:18,543 --> 00:15:21,587
-No, no, no. Nobody died.
-l'm sorry.

222
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,882
-So...
-l mean, well...

223
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:30,470
What do you think the Greeks would think
of this rather sombre attire?

224
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,348
l don't know.

225
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,351
Dinner was very good.

226
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,270
-Yeah. lt wasn't bad, honey.
-Thanks, thanks, thank you.

227
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,441
Usually Ann achieves a kind of critical mass
with the salt,

228
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,610
but tonight was... l always tell her,

229
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,071
"You can always add more,
but you can't take it away."

230
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:50,115
Yeah. You say that, don't you?

231
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,453
So, do you have family here?

232
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:56,496
Mother, father, my sister.

233
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,335
-Sister older or younger?
-Younger.

234
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,880
Are you close?

235
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,635
l'm sorry... l'm prying again. l'm sorry.

236
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,803
Were you prying before?

237
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,348
Yeah, this afternoon l was grilling Ann
about your marriage.

238
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,851
-How'd it go?
-Well, very well.

239
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:24,483
So l was asking about your sister.

240
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,693
Yeah. Well...

241
00:16:27,654 --> 00:16:30,155
We get along all right. lt's just that...

242
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,743
Well, l think she's an extrovert.

243
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,666
l just think she's loud.

244
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:43,085
She probably wouldn't agree.

245
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,213
No. Definitely wouldn't agree.

246
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,844
So, listen,
you gonna see Elizabeth while you're here?

247
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,930
l don't know.

248
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:59,184
-Who's Elizabeth?
-lt's a girl Graham dated in school.

249
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:02,479
Well, after the chapel episodes.

250
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,441
She still lives here,
to the best of my knowledge.

251
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,239
So, Graham and l were talking about
apartments today,

252
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:16,910
and l told him that they've got those lovely
little apartments in the Garden District

253
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:20,622
and that they're really nice,
the garage apartments...

254
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:24,584
-There's critical crime in the Garden District.
-John, come on. That is not true.

255
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:26,753
l don't know what kind of place
you're looking for,

256
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,716
but there are plenty of studio apartments
available elsewhere.

257
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,051
l'm sorry?

258
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,846
No, it's just right now l have one key.

259
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,973
You know, everything l own is in the car.

260
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,559
l just... l like that.

261
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:43,061
lf l get an apartment, that's two keys.

262
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:47,065
lf l get a job, you know,
l might have to open or close.

263
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,900
That's more keys. You know, buy some stuff.

264
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,570
Then l'm afraid it's gonna get ripped off
or something.

265
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,321
Then l get more keys.

266
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:55,031
You know, l just like having the one key.
lt's clean.

267
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,410
Don't have to worry about losing them.
l always lose my keys. l hate that.

268
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,495
Get rid of the car
when you get the apartment.

269
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,249
-No. l like having the car.
-You'd still have one key.

270
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,127
Car is important. Gotta be mobile.

271
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,172
ln case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry?

272
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,924
Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry.

273
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,761
Excuse me.

274
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,769
-Do you want some help? Sure?
-No, no. Really.

275
00:18:23,853 --> 00:18:26,480
l'm fine. There's not that much to do.

276
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:33,904
Graham, do you pay taxes?

277
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,574
Yeah, l pay taxes. Yeah, l pay taxes.
What do you mean?

278
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,119
lf you don't pay taxes, you're a liar.
l'm not a liar.

279
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:46,082
Liars are the second-lowest form
of human being on the planet.

280
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,169
-What's the first?
-Lawyers.

281
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,379
That's you, honey.

282
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,678
Annie, why don't you go with Graham
and hunt for apartments?

283
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:01,014
Show him how the city's changed.

284
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,683
-Would you mind, Graham?
-No, l'd love that.

285
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,646
-l'd like that, too. Let's do that.
-All right. How about tomorrow?

286
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,689
-That'd be great.
-Good.

287
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:13,735
One key, huh?

288
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,239
Great idea.

289
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:29,334
-Yeah.
-Cyndi, John.

290
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:32,295
Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.

291
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,924
You are scum. l'll be there.

292
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,725
As you can see,
there's plenty of room for two.

293
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,646
No. lt will just be me.

294
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,358
-No party of two?
-No.

295
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,486
You can hang a shower curtain in the bath.

296
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:58,864
And make sure you put something
in the tub so you won't fall.

297
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,323
-Okay.
-Okay.

298
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,826
You said about 350?

299
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,664
Yeah, and plus the first
and the last month's rent.

300
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,378
All right. Will you lease month to month?

301
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,589
Not for 350.

302
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,799
How about 400?

303
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,849
l can live with that. l can live with that.

304
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,851
-Okay. lt's a deal.
-All right.

305
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,519
-Ready?
-Okay.

306
00:20:41,866 --> 00:20:44,743
-John?
-ln here.

307
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,551
Well, ain't you a picture?

308
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,705
Well, do you like it?

309
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,669
lt's lovely.

310
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,046
ls it for me?

311
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:41,716
Yeah. lt's for you.

312
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,658
ls that for me?

313
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,828
Yeah. lt's for you.

314
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,601
You're amazing, dear.

315
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:47,532
Can l tell you something personal?

316
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,705
lt's up to you.
Can l tell you something personal?

317
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,206
Yeah. Yeah.

318
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,629
Well, you gotta go first.

319
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:03,548
Okay.

320
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:13,099
l think that...

321
00:23:13,184 --> 00:23:15,727
l think that sex is overrated.

322
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:19,355
l think that people
place far too much importance on it.

323
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,359
And l think that stuff about women
want it just as bad as men is crap.

324
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,111
l mean, l think that women want it.

325
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,907
l just don't think that they want it
for the same reason that men think they do.

326
00:23:29,617 --> 00:23:32,494
And l'm getting confused.

327
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:37,165
-Do you understand what l'm...
-Yeah. Yeah.

328
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:43,088
Yeah. l remember reading somewhere

329
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:48,635
that men learn to love
the person that they're attracted to

330
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:53,431
and that women become
more and more attracted

331
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,517
to the person that they love.

332
00:23:57,311 --> 00:24:00,480
God. That's beautiful.

333
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,525
That's really beautiful.

334
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:07,320
-l like that.
-l'm just quoting.

335
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:11,116
So are you gonna
tell me something personal?

336
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,202
-Do you want me to?
-Yeah, yeah. l do.

337
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:17,372
l mean, l don't want it to be something gross
about some scar or something.

338
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:20,875
l want it to be something
really personal about yourself.

339
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,669
All right. Okay.

340
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,796
l'm impotent.

341
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,341
-You're what?
-lmpotent.

342
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,761
You are?

343
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:36,057
Yeah. l mean... Well, l can't...

344
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:41,020
l can't get an erection
in the presence of another person.

345
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,776
So, for all practical purposes, l'm impotent.

346
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,240
Does that bother you?

347
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,118
No.

348
00:24:57,454 --> 00:25:00,582
Does it make you feel self-conscious?

349
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:12,093
Not usually.

350
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:17,432
No... Yeah, l'm self-conscious.

351
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:22,979
Not in the same way that you are, though.

352
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,607
Me? Me? You think l'm self-conscious?

353
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,442
Well...

354
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:31,654
l've been watching you.
You know, l've been watching you...

355
00:25:31,739 --> 00:25:34,073
l watch you eat. l watch you speak.

356
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,410
Watch you move, and l...

357
00:25:38,454 --> 00:25:42,290
l see somebody who is extremely aware

358
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,626
of people looking at you.

359
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,047
You know, my therapist...

360
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:52,759
-You're in therapy?
-Aren't you?

361
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:56,304
No. No, l'm not. No.

362
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,725
l was a miserable failure in therapy.

363
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,645
So you don't believe in therapy?

364
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:08,107
No, l... l believe in it for some people.

365
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:11,903
l don't know. lt was silly for me.

366
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,905
l was confused going in.

367
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,786
So l just formed my own theory

368
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,998
that you should never take advice from
someone that doesn't know you intimately.

369
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:29,504
Well, l know my therapist intimately.

370
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:36,928
-You've had sex with your therapist?
-No! No! No!

371
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,806
l'm... That's what l meant.

372
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,684
Someone you've had sex with.

373
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,278
l'm... l don't understand.

374
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,906
l mean, how would you know?

375
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,951
l mean, you know. How...

376
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,288
No. l wasn't always impotent.

377
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,666
Okay.

378
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:10,003
So let me see.

379
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:16,092
You said...
You said that l should never take advice

380
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,094
from someone that l haven't had sex with.

381
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,804
Right? Right?

382
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
-Basically.
-Right.

383
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:25,476
And we haven't had sex.

384
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,396
-Right?
-No.

385
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,898
So l guess from your own advice,

386
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,901
l shouldn't take your advice.

387
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:36,529
-l wouldn't.
-You wouldn't. Okay.

388
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,658
All right.

389
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,913
-And drive safely.
-Yeah, right.

390
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:15,044
-How was your weekend?
-lt was okay.

391
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,633
Did you confront John about the visitor?

392
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,218
The visitor?

393
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,720
The friend of John's
that was staying at your house.

394
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,140
-Graham.
-Graham.

395
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,894
Yeah. l mean... No.

396
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,523
That actually turned out to be interesting.

397
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,820
You know, l was expecting him
to be just like John,

398
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,574
you know, 'cause they went to school
together and everything,

399
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:48,911
you know,
talking about getting drunk together

400
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:51,622
and secret handshakes and...

401
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:59,464
He turned out to be,

402
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,341
really, this character.

403
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,053
He's kind of arty,

404
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,265
but okay.

405
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:11,309
ls he still at your house?

406
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,396
No. No, no. He's gone.

407
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,736
-So where's he from?
-l don't know.

408
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:26,574
He used to live in New York
and Philadelphia.

409
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,868
l think he just, kind of, travels around.

410
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:30,745
Must be nice.

411
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,955
So what's he like? ls he like John?

412
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,792
No. l don't think John likes him any more.

413
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,172
He says he thinks
he's gotten kind of strange.

414
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,424
ls he? Strange, l mean.

415
00:30:44,218 --> 00:30:45,218
No.

416
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,846
l mean,
if l saw him on the street l might think so.

417
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:52,266
But after meeting and talking to him,
l just say he's kind of unusual.

418
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,438
-So what's he look like?
-Why?

419
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,692
-l just wanna know what he looks like, is all.
-Why? So you can go after him?

420
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:05,655
Jesus, Ann. Get a life.
l just asked what he looked like.

421
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:07,615
Besides,

422
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,076
even if l decided to fuck his brains out,

423
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,621
what business is that of yours?

424
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,540
Why do you have to say that?

425
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:17,041
-Say what?
-You know what.

426
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:21,629
-You say it just to irritate me.
-l say it because it's descriptive.

427
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,382
Well, he doesn't strike me
as the kind of person

428
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,884
who'd go in for that kind of thing, anyway.

429
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:29,095
Ann, you always underestimate me.

430
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,138
l wonder why.

431
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,893
l think you're afraid to put us
in the same room together.

432
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,521
l think you're afraid
he'd be undeniably drawn to me.

433
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:41,148
Really, Cynthia, l don't think he's your type.

434
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,364
My type?
How would you know what my type is?

435
00:31:48,532 --> 00:31:50,658
l have a pretty good idea.

436
00:31:52,661 --> 00:31:55,246
Ann, you don't have a clue.

437
00:31:55,831 --> 00:31:58,916
Look, l don't even know
why we're discussing this.

438
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:02,920
l mean, l'll just go over and call him myself.

439
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:04,839
He doesn't have a phone.

440
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,967
Well, l'll call him when he does.

441
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,887
He won't.

442
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:14,056
What are you talking about?

443
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:17,602
He doesn't like to talk on the phone.
He's not getting a phone.

444
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,270
Oh, please.

445
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:24,734
Okay, so give me the Zen master's address.
l'll think of a reason to stop by.

446
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,405
Please. Just let me talk to him first.

447
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,200
Why? Just give me the address.
You won't even have to be involved.

448
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:49,550
l don't feel right just giving you the address
so that you can go over there and...

449
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:52,928
-And what?
-Do whatever it is you do.

450
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,555
"Do whatever it is you do."

451
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,600
-Listen to the way you talk.
-l talk fine.

452
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,061
Thank you. l was still smoking that.

453
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,565
What did you lose?

454
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:08,402
My goddamn pearl earring.

455
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,822
lt cost me a fucking fortune.

456
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,742
l must have left it somewhere.

457
00:33:16,036 --> 00:33:18,454
So what are you getting Mama
for her birthday?

458
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,832
l don't know. l'll get her a card or something.

459
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:23,626
A card for her 50th birthday?

460
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:27,213
-Yeah. What's wrong with that?
-Well, the woman gave birth to you.

461
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:29,340
l think you might be giving her something...

462
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,467
Will you stop? Jesus.

463
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,680
-l just thought that maybe for once...
-Okay, Ann. Okay.

464
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,057
How about this?

465
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,184
You get her something nice,

466
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:43,229
and l'll pay for half, all right?

467
00:33:43,313 --> 00:33:45,564
Fine. Fine.

468
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,483
-Fine.
-Fine.

469
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:50,736
Okay, now, if you'll pardon me,
l have to go to work.

470
00:33:57,077 --> 00:34:00,579
What is the most unusual location

471
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,707
you've ever masturbated in?

472
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:05,960
Well,

473
00:34:09,089 --> 00:34:10,923
one time l was flying

474
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:15,136
from Los Angeles to New York.

475
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:21,350
And l was... lt was a really crowded flight,

476
00:34:21,435 --> 00:34:24,520
and l was sitting in the middle.

477
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,522
l didn't get a window. l didn't get an aisle.

478
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,441
lt was really funny.

479
00:34:28,525 --> 00:34:32,611
l was just bored.
My magazines were just boring.

480
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,281
l think l had, like, a woman's magazine.

481
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:38,909
You know, they touch on a lot of
sexual issues and stuff like that.

482
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,202
And l was just thinking to myself,

483
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,997
"God, that's what I need.
l need a little, you know,

484
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,834
"something to take my mind off this trip."

485
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:50,254
So l was just thinking away.

486
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,798
And then l just...

487
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:56,594
l just did it on the plane
just between these two people.

488
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:59,096
And nobody knew. l mean...

489
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:07,021
How were you able to not betray
what was going on

490
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,023
to the people around you?

491
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:15,112
Well, you know, l have really strong muscles.

492
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,532
lt's open.

493
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,119
-Hi.
-Hello, Ann.

494
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,914
-l hope l'm not bothering you.
-No. No.

495
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,791
l would have phoned.

496
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:29,919
-You busy?
-No. l can finish later.

497
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,923
l just wanted to come by and see what
the apartment looked like with furniture.

498
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:37,468
Yeah. l'm afraid there's not much to see.

499
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:41,555
l'm sort of cultivating this minimalist vibe.

500
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,935
-You could use a bookshelf.
-Yeah? You think so?

501
00:35:48,021 --> 00:35:50,856
l don't know. They're all library books.

502
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:58,697
-What are these?
-Those are videotapes.

503
00:35:58,782 --> 00:36:02,284
l can see that. Of what?

504
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:07,122
lt's a personal project l've been working on.

505
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,416
What kind of personal project?

506
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,755
-What?
-What kind of personal project?

507
00:36:18,927 --> 00:36:22,179
Personal project
like anyone else's personal project.

508
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:26,600
Mine's just a little more personal, l guess.

509
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:30,312
Who's Donna?

510
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,983
-What?
-Donna. lt says Donna here on the tape.

511
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:37,111
Donna was a girl l knew in Florida.

512
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:39,905
You went out with her?

513
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,201
No. Not really.

514
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,998
Why do these tapes
all have women's names on them?

515
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:55,129
Well, l enjoy interviewing women
more than men.

516
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,216
-lt's iced tea.
-Thanks.

517
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:01,385
l'm sorry. Do you want some lemon?

518
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,596
No. This is perfect. This is perfect.

519
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,558
So all of these are interviews?

520
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,352
-Yes.
-Can we watch one?

521
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,690
No, l'd... No.

522
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,191
Why not?

523
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,739
Well, l promised each of the subjects

524
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:25,200
that no one would see the videotapes
except for me.

525
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,664
What are the interviews about?

526
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,876
The interviews are about sex.

527
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,547
Sex?

528
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,968
What about sex?

529
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:50,225
Everything about sex.

530
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,019
Like what?

531
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,566
What they've done. What they do.

532
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,736
What they want to do
but are afraid to ask for.

533
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,948
What they wouldn't do even if asked.

534
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:08,744
Anything l can think of. Your iced...

535
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:16,251
You just ask them questions?

536
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,753
Yes.

537
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:23,717
-And they answer them?
-Yeah.

538
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,223
-Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
-To you?

539
00:38:29,766 --> 00:38:33,227
No. For the camera.

540
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:37,898
-Graham, this is just so...
-l'm sorry this came up. l'm...

541
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:42,820
No, l'm sorry. l'm sorry this came up.

542
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:44,655
l'm gonna go.

543
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,323
-Here. l'll take...
-l'm...

544
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:48,742
-Goodbye.
-Okay. Yeah, all right.

545
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:50,828
Okay.

546
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:02,840
He doesn't want you to come over.

547
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,592
What do you mean he doesn't want me
to come over? Did you tell him about me?

548
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:08,178
-No, l didn't.
-Why not?

549
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:11,265
-Look, Cynthia. l didn't have time.
-Well, why?

550
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,893
John's right. He's very strange.

551
00:39:14,978 --> 00:39:17,021
And you don't wanna get involved with him.

552
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:18,522
What happened over there?

553
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,649
-Did he make a pass at you?
-No.

554
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:24,236
Well, what's the story, then? What's
this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden?

555
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,448
-l mean, is he drowning puppies?
-lt's nothing like that, okay?

556
00:39:27,532 --> 00:39:32,119
-Well, what? ls he dangerous?
-No, not physically.

557
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,122
Well, what, then?

558
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,124
l don't wanna talk about it.

559
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,626
-Then why did you call me?
-l don't know.

560
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:52,723
-Hello?
-Cynthia, John.

561
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,684
Not today. l've got other plans.

562
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:00,856
Well, when, then?

563
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,400
How about inviting me over to dinner?

564
00:40:03,485 --> 00:40:07,196
-You know what l mean.
-Yeah, l know what you mean.

565
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:16,872
lt's open.

566
00:40:21,169 --> 00:40:22,169
Hi.

567
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,254
Hello.

568
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,926
l... Can l help you?

569
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:31,011
l'm Cynthia Bishop.

570
00:40:32,013 --> 00:40:33,430
l'm sorry. Do l know you? l don't...

571
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,682
l'm Ann Mullany's sister.

572
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:38,102
The extrovert.

573
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,772
She must've been in a good mood when
she said that. She usually calls me loud.

574
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:43,899
Yeah. She called you that, too.

575
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:49,029
So what are you doing here?

576
00:40:49,197 --> 00:40:50,864
-You want me to leave?
-No.

577
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,699
l just want to know what you're doing here.

578
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:57,955
Well, like l said, Ann is my sister.
Sisters talk.

579
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:00,124
You can imagine the rest.

580
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:06,380
No, l think it's probably better
if l don't characterise that conversation

581
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,382
that l didn't hear.

582
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:17,099
l don't have any idea really what you or Ann
said about me or anything else.

583
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,604
-Do you want some iced tea?
-Sure.

584
00:41:22,689 --> 00:41:24,815
l don't have any lemons.

585
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:31,155
The last time l saw Ann,
she left here very confused, l'd say,

586
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:33,907
-and upset.
-She still is.

587
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:41,081
So are you here to make me feel bad
for making her feel bad?

588
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,001
No.

589
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:51,550
-She didn't tell you why she was upset?
-No.

590
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,933
Thanks.

591
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,649
So l don't understand.

592
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:10,027
What made you wanna come here?

593
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:14,948
l can't imagine Ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me.

594
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:16,658
Yeah, well, see,

595
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,578
l don't really listen to Ann
when it comes to men.

596
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,873
l mean, look at John, for Christ sake.

597
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,335
But then you went to school with him,
didn't you?

598
00:42:26,419 --> 00:42:29,213
You're probably friends or something.

599
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:30,297
No.

600
00:42:33,218 --> 00:42:35,260
No. l think John is a liar.

601
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,474
l think you're right.

602
00:42:42,477 --> 00:42:47,814
So, come on. l came all the way over here
to find out what got Ann so spooked.

603
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:49,858
Would you tell me what happened?

604
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,819
"Spooked"? The...

605
00:42:54,614 --> 00:42:57,532
The videotapes are what got Ann
so spooked.

606
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:19,680
-l think l get it.
-Oh, yeah? What do you get?

607
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:24,559
lfAnn got freaked out by these,
they must be something sexual.

608
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:27,562
Are these tapes of you
having sex with these girls?

609
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:29,398
No, not exactly.

610
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:32,150
Well, either you are or you aren't.
Which is it?

611
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,069
Why don't you let me tape you?

612
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,240
-Doing what?
-Talking.

613
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,409
About what?

614
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:45,372
About sex, your sexual history,
sexual preferences.

615
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,460
What makes you think
l'd discuss that with you?

616
00:43:50,545 --> 00:43:51,753
Nothing.

617
00:43:56,843 --> 00:44:00,178
And you just wanna ask me questions?

618
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,805
l just wanna ask you questions.

619
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,807
-That's all.
-That's all.

620
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:10,480
ls this how you get off or something,

621
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:13,317
taping women talking about
their sexual experiences?

622
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,943
Yes.

623
00:44:15,028 --> 00:44:17,404
-Would anyone else see the tape?
-Absolutely not.

624
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,781
Nobody else sees the tapes except for me.

625
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,701
How long will it take?

626
00:44:25,246 --> 00:44:30,542
Well, that depends on you.
One woman used up only three minutes.

627
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,211
And another used three two-hour tapes.

628
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,924
How do we start?

629
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,053
l turn on the camera, and you start talking.

630
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,682
Do l sit or stand?

631
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,727
-Whatever you prefer.
-l prefer to sit.

632
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,612
Are you ready?

633
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,831
Okay, l'm recording. So tell me your name.

634
00:45:10,458 --> 00:45:13,210
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.

635
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:16,088
-Speak in a normal voice.
-Okay.

636
00:45:17,924 --> 00:45:21,551
So describe for me
your first sexual experience.

637
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,143
My first sexual experience,
or the first time l had intercourse?

638
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,562
-First sexual experience.
-First sexual experience.

639
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:42,322
l was

640
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,617
eight.

641
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:49,413
And... ls this the kind of thing that...

642
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,789
Yeah, okay.

643
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,835
l was eight years old,

644
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:59,256
and Michael Green, who was also eight,

645
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:01,967
asked if he could watch me take a pee.

646
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:06,179
And l said he could
if l could watch him take one, too.

647
00:46:06,264 --> 00:46:10,934
So, we went to the woods behind my house,

648
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,061
and l got this feeling
that he was chickening out,

649
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,564
because he kept saying, "Ladies first."

650
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:22,112
So l pulled down my little panties
and urinated,

651
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:25,365
and he ran away before l even finished.

652
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:30,120
So, was it a topic of conversation
between the two of you after that?

653
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,331
No! He kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer,

654
00:46:33,416 --> 00:46:36,084
and then his family moved away.

655
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:39,129
To Cleveland, actually.

656
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,007
-What a shame.
-Yeah.

657
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:47,012
When did you finally see a penis?

658
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,890
When l was 14.

659
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:54,186
So what did you think?

660
00:46:54,270 --> 00:46:58,231
Was it what you expected it to be?

661
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:05,989
No. Not really. l...

662
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:12,078
l didn't... l sort of pictured it...

663
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:20,212
l didn't think it would have veins
or ridges or anything.

664
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:23,715
l just thought it would be smooth,
like a test tube.

665
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,928
lt's weird, thinking about it now.

666
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:38,563
The organ itself seemed like a separate thing

667
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,524
and a separate entity to me.

668
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:45,570
l mean, when he finally pulled it out,
and l could look at it and touch it,

669
00:47:45,655 --> 00:47:48,532
l completely forgot
that there was a guy attached to it.

670
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,202
l remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me.

671
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,329
What did he say?

672
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:56,623
He said my hand felt good.

673
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,420
Then what happened?

674
00:48:06,801 --> 00:48:10,470
And then l started moving my hand,

675
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:12,806
and then he stopped talking.

676
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,080
-Yeah?
-John. Cynthia.

677
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:42,669
-How'd you get through?
-l told Janet l was Ann.

678
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,215
-She bought it?
-Well, obviously.

679
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:51,720
Look, l want to see you.

680
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,848
-Well, when?
-Right now.

681
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:57,559
l don't know if l can do that.
l've got a client waiting.

682
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,395
l've already rescheduled him once.

683
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,440
l'll have to do
some pretty heavy duty juggling.

684
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:07,152
Then get those balls in the air,
and get your butt over here.

685
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,758
-Yes, sir.
-Janet.

686
00:49:29,842 --> 00:49:33,178
Listen, l want you to reschedule Kirkland.
l know. l know. l know.

687
00:49:33,262 --> 00:49:36,306
See if he can come in Monday anytime.

688
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,892
Tell him... Tell him...

689
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:43,063
-Family crisis. Family crisis.
-Okay.

690
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,148
-l'll slip out the back.
-Yes, sir.

691
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,150
All right. Bye.

692
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:53,323
Would you like me to take my skirt off?

693
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,080
lf you wish.

694
00:50:22,103 --> 00:50:23,937
You're not wearing any underwear.

695
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,528
Do you like the way l look?

696
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,531
Yes.

697
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:40,495
Do you think l'm pretty?

698
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:43,039
Yes.

699
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,963
Prettier than Ann?

700
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,757
Different.

701
00:50:58,556 --> 00:51:01,182
John and Ann don't have sex any more.

702
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,732
ls that what he tells you?

703
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,775
He doesn't have to tell me.

704
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,000
You're on fire today.

705
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:36,509
Yes.

706
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:41,848
You can go now.

707
00:51:45,519 --> 00:51:47,187
He just asked me questions.

708
00:51:49,690 --> 00:51:51,483
What kind of questions?

709
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:56,237
Questions about sex.

710
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,493
Well, what did he ask exactly?

711
00:52:01,577 --> 00:52:05,121
Well, l don't wanna tell you exactly.

712
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:10,043
You let a total stranger record
your sexual life on videotape,

713
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,961
but you won't tell your own sister.

714
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:13,463
Apparently.

715
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,800
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?

716
00:52:19,303 --> 00:52:22,514
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
No, he didn't.

717
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:24,682
-Did you take your clothes off?
-Yes, l did.

718
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:27,143
-Cynthia!
-What?

719
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,354
-Why did you do that?
-Because l wanted to.

720
00:52:29,438 --> 00:52:32,732
-But why did you want to?
-Because l wanted him to see me.

721
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,484
You're crazy.

722
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:36,319
He could be bouncing that off some satellite.

723
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:38,988
Some horny, old men in South America
could be watching you.

724
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,157
Ann! He wouldn't do that.

725
00:52:41,242 --> 00:52:45,453
-You don't know that for sure.
-Well, it's too late now, isn't it?

726
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,083
-Did he touch you?
-No.

727
00:52:51,836 --> 00:52:54,420
-Did you touch him?
-No.

728
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,219
Did anybody touch anybody?

729
00:53:03,222 --> 00:53:05,014
Well, yes.

730
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,561
Don't tell me.

731
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:11,855
Don't tell me!

732
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,107
Don't tell me! You didn't!

733
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,400
-l did.
-You didn't!

734
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,235
-l did. l did!
-You didn't!

735
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:20,488
Oh, my God! Cynthia!

736
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,284
You're in trouble.

737
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,204
Listen to you. You sound like Mama.

738
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,956
What are you talking about?

739
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,543
God, Cynthia!

740
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:36,004
l couldn't even do that in front of John.

741
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,630
You couldn't even do it, period.

742
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:40,216
You know what l mean.
You don't even know him.

743
00:53:40,301 --> 00:53:42,176
-l feel like l do.
-You don't!

744
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:44,137
You can't possibly trust him. He's perverted!

745
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,348
Look, Ann, l don't understand
why this freaks you out so much.

746
00:53:47,433 --> 00:53:51,144
You didn't do it. l did. And if it doesn't
bother me, why should it bother you?

747
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,648
-l don't wanna talk about it.
-Okay, then don't!

748
00:54:15,544 --> 00:54:18,046
Are you an assassin?

749
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,298
Excuse me?

750
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,675
You're just an errand boy,

751
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,720
sent by the grocer to collect the bill.

752
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,311
lt's my Brando. That's pretty good, isn't it?

753
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:37,148
-Marlon Brando?
-lt's great. Pardon me.

754
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,401
Okay. Yeah.
l was thinking we needed time apart.

755
00:54:40,486 --> 00:54:43,112
Maybe you should be there for a while.

756
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:47,784
Hi. So why don't you get
an answering machine?

757
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:51,120
-There's a phone here.
-lt's busy.

758
00:54:51,205 --> 00:54:53,164
Why don't you keep trying?

759
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:56,709
Okay.

760
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,005
Well, here it is.

761
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:03,591
-What is it?
-lt's a sundress.

762
00:55:03,676 --> 00:55:05,385
Looks like a tablecloth.

763
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:07,428
lt does not.

764
00:55:07,513 --> 00:55:08,888
Why would she want a sundress? l mean,

765
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:11,724
she's got spots on her shoulders
and varicose veins.

766
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:13,810
Well, Missy Thing, so will you someday.

767
00:55:13,894 --> 00:55:16,312
Yeah. When l do,
l won't be wearing sundresses.

768
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,233
-God, Cynthia...
-Hold on.

769
00:55:33,455 --> 00:55:35,581
-Bayou.
-Cynthia. John.

770
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:37,250
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here.

771
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,627
-Would you like to speak with her?
-What's she doing there?

772
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:43,423
She came by to show me a present that
she and l are buying for your mother-in-law.

773
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:49,220
-So, when can l see you?
-l don't know.

774
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,682
l'm not sure l can duplicate
the intensity l had the other day.

775
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,976
Nothing wrong with trying.

776
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,770
l don't think my sister would agree.

777
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:00,857
Do you want me to stop calling?

778
00:56:00,983 --> 00:56:04,152
-Look, l'll call you, okay?
-Roger.

779
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:09,073
Hi. This is too much.

780
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:10,992
l'm wearing red. You're wearing red.

781
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,618
That's quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say?

782
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:15,580
-Look, l'm married.
-Really?

783
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:19,625
-Are you very married?
-Married enough.

784
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:22,795
l see. Well, that shouldn't stop us.

785
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,797
l'm just here to see my sister, okay?

786
00:56:24,882 --> 00:56:28,509
Really? Who's your sister? ls she married?

787
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:32,722
So what's my share on the dress?

788
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,223
$32.50.

789
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:36,017
-lt's a nice dress.
-Thank you.

790
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,561
-l thought so, too.
-Looks like a tablecloth,

791
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,813
-but it's very nice.
-Keep the change. And, Ann,

792
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,608
don't worry about the dress.
l'm sure she'll like it.

793
00:56:45,194 --> 00:56:48,738
Yeah. l think... You have to go?
Okay. Goodbye.

794
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,740
l'll see you later. l'll call you.

795
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,117
Bye.

796
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:24,774
John?

797
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:32,448
l called you last Monday at 3:30,
and they said you weren't in.

798
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,743
Do you remember where you were?

799
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,871
On Monday?

800
00:57:41,834 --> 00:57:43,292
Last Monday.

801
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:45,962
l had a late lunch.

802
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,216
So who did you have lunch with?

803
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,722
l ate by myself.

804
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,351
Come on.

805
00:58:08,152 --> 00:58:09,569
ls there something wrong?

806
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,321
Are you having an affair?

807
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:18,202
Jesus Christ!

808
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:24,167
l have a late lunch by myself,
and now l'm fucking somebody?

809
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:26,377
-Well, are you?
-No, l'm not.

810
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,882
God, l'm offended at the accusation.
Come on.

811
00:58:34,386 --> 00:58:36,721
lf l'm right, l wanna know.

812
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:41,392
l don't want you to lie. l'd be upset,
but l'd be more upset if you lied to me.

813
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,730
Well, there's nothing to know.

814
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51,819
l can't tell you
how upset l'll be if you lie to me.

815
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,535
ls this paranoia?

816
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:07,168
l mean, if anybody should be paranoid,
l should be.

817
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,299
Every time l try to touch you,
you act as if l'm dipped in shit.

818
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,387
l think there are a lot of women out there

819
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,098
that would be glad to have a young,
straight male,

820
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:24,060
making a pretty good living,

821
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:27,647
beside them in bed with a hard-on.

822
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:30,233
-My sister, for one.
-For God's sake, Ann.

823
00:59:30,317 --> 00:59:33,986
-ls that who it is?
-Ann, l'm not fucking your sister.

824
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:36,656
l don't find her that attractive, for one thing.

825
00:59:37,157 --> 00:59:39,951
-ls that supposed to comfort me?
-No, l'm just saying...

826
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:45,248
l'm just saying l didn't get paranoid
when you didn't want to make love to me.

827
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,542
l mean, l could have easily assumed

828
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:51,128
that you didn't want to
because you were having an affair.

829
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:52,588
l'm not.

830
00:59:52,673 --> 00:59:55,925
-Well, l'm not either.
-Then why don't l believe you?

831
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,552
Look, this is ridiculous.

832
00:59:58,637 --> 01:00:01,264
-Maybe when you have some evidence...
-Evidence? There's some evidence?

833
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:06,727
No, no. That's not what l'm saying. l'm just
saying that we shouldn't not ever talk.

834
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,689
Just don't give me conjecture and intuition.

835
01:00:10,190 --> 01:00:12,400
-Always a lawyer.
-Goddamn right!

836
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:16,612
l mean, can you imagine? "Well, Your
Honour, l'm just positive the man is guilty.

837
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:20,116
-"l can't place him at the scene..."
-All right. All right. All right.

838
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,286
-"...but l have this strong feeling."
-All right. You made your point. Okay.

839
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:24,787
All right.

840
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,504
l'm sorry.

841
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:39,677
l'm just under a lot of pressure
with this Kirkland thing.

842
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:43,723
You know,
it's my first big case as junior partner.

843
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:49,103
l work all day, and l come home,

844
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,147
and l look forward to seeing you.

845
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:59,572
lt hurts that you'd accuse me like that.

846
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,116
l'm sorry.

847
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,746
What? Come on.

848
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,709
l've just got all this time on my hands,

849
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:18,466
and l just sit around and start
inventing these, like, intricate scenarios.

850
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:23,929
And then l don't want to have wasted
all my time, so l want to believe them.

851
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,937
-lsn't therapy helping at all?
-John, l don't know.

852
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:35,441
l just feel so stupid sitting there
talking about my little problems

853
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:38,319
when l know
those poor children are starving.

854
01:01:38,987 --> 01:01:40,446
Well...

855
01:01:44,451 --> 01:01:47,370
Quitting your therapy is not going

856
01:01:47,621 --> 01:01:50,373
to feed the children in Ethiopia.

857
01:01:51,625 --> 01:01:53,459
l know.

858
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:00,883
You never used to say the word "fucking."

859
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,513
Fuck!

860
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:11,811
lt's so blatantly stupid,
l have a hard time believing you did it.

861
01:02:11,895 --> 01:02:13,896
What's so stupid about it?

862
01:02:16,316 --> 01:02:18,275
You don't even know the guy.

863
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,237
Well, you know him. He's a friend of yours.

864
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:23,406
Do you think he can be trusted?

865
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,491
l don't know.

866
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,664
l don't know.
From what you've told me, l don't know.

867
01:02:31,915 --> 01:02:34,583
l should have known
when he showed up dressed

868
01:02:34,668 --> 01:02:37,420
like some undertaker for the art world.

869
01:02:37,504 --> 01:02:39,505
l like the way he dresses.

870
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,392
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?

871
01:02:52,644 --> 01:02:54,562
"The wrong hands"?

872
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,982
John, we are not talking
about military secrets here.

873
01:02:58,066 --> 01:03:03,529
They're just tapes he makes
so he could sit around and get off.

874
01:03:05,657 --> 01:03:08,742
And he doesn't have sex with any of them?
They just talk?

875
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:11,745
They just sit around and talk.

876
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:18,002
l could almost understand it
if he had sex with them. l mean, almost.

877
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:24,508
Why doesn't he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or something?

878
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:25,801
lt doesn't work.

879
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:28,804
He has to know the people.
He has to be able to interact with them.

880
01:03:28,889 --> 01:03:30,181
"lnteract"?

881
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:32,725
Whatever that means.

882
01:03:34,728 --> 01:03:37,188
Did you have to masturbate in front of him?

883
01:03:37,272 --> 01:03:41,233
l felt like it. Goddamn!
You and Ann make such a big deal out of it.

884
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:43,277
-You told Ann about this?
-Yeah, she is my sister.

885
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,362
-l do tell her almost everything.
-l wish you hadn't done that.

886
01:03:45,447 --> 01:03:46,489
Why not?

887
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,284
lt's just something l'd prefer
she didn't have to know about.

888
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:52,745
She's a grown-up. She can handle it.

889
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,829
Ann...

890
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,417
-Ann is just very...
-Hung-up!

891
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:03,255
-lt just wasn't a smart thing to do.
-Oh, God!

892
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:08,594
Did you sign any sort of paper, or...

893
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:13,516
Did he have a contract with you saying
that he wouldn't broadcast these things?

894
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,601
No, sir.

895
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:18,103
You realise you have no recourse legally.

896
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:24,568
lt's not funny. lt's not funny, Cynthia.

897
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:27,154
Those tapes could show up anywhere.

898
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:29,657
They won't. l trust him.

899
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:32,952
You trust him. That's funny.

900
01:04:33,453 --> 01:04:37,957
Yeah, l do,
a hell of a lot more than l trust you.

901
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:43,337
-What do you mean?
-Just what l said.

902
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:45,923
l'd trust him before l'd trust you.

903
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:49,927
God, it hurts that you'd say that to me.

904
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,763
Come on, John!
You're fucking your wife's sister.

905
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,765
You're a liar,
but at least l know you're a liar.

906
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,977
l know. l know.
Second-lowest form of human being,

907
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,937
and the first.

908
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,522
-What are you talking about?
-Nothing.

909
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:04,108
By definition, you're lying to Ann, too.

910
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:06,110
Yeah, right,

911
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:10,823
but l didn't take a vow in front of God
and everyone to be faithful to Ann.

912
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:20,207
Look, are we gonna do it or not?

913
01:05:21,084 --> 01:05:23,544
Actually, no.

914
01:05:24,129 --> 01:05:26,880
l've changed my mind.
l shouldn't have called.

915
01:05:27,507 --> 01:05:29,341
l'm here now.

916
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:32,761
l need to do something.

917
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:35,014
Would you like to help me straighten up?

918
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:41,437
Jesus! ls there one chair
in this place that works?

919
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:45,566
Well, why don't you go sit somewhere else?

920
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:48,694
Come on, John.

921
01:05:49,112 --> 01:05:52,615
You should be happy.
We've gone this far without Ann finding out.

922
01:05:52,699 --> 01:05:56,285
l'm making it real easy on you.
Just walk out of here.

923
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,245
-Did he put you up to this?
-Who?

924
01:05:58,330 --> 01:06:01,749
-Graham.
-No, he didn't put me up to this.

925
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:05,544
Jesus, l don't need people to tell me what
to do. l've just been thinking, that's all.

926
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,421
Now, just leave.

927
01:06:08,882 --> 01:06:10,966
Well, maybe l don't want to leave.

928
01:06:11,885 --> 01:06:13,802
Maybe l want to talk.

929
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:17,890
John, we don't have anything to talk about.

930
01:06:20,268 --> 01:06:21,727
Yeah, you're right.

931
01:06:24,064 --> 01:06:26,065
Things are getting complicated.

932
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,652
No, they're getting real simple.

933
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:07,684
lt's open.

934
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:17,820
Hello.

935
01:09:22,617 --> 01:09:24,201
Want something to drink?

936
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,580
Yeah. Thanks.

937
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,132
Sorry. l don't have any iced tea left.

938
01:09:43,471 --> 01:09:44,763
Thank you.

939
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:55,816
John and Cynthia have been fucking.

940
01:09:58,444 --> 01:09:59,987
Yes, l know.

941
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:04,324
-You know?
-Yes.

942
01:10:06,119 --> 01:10:07,619
How did you know?

943
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:13,709
She said it on her tape.

944
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,879
Thanks for telling me. l really appreciate it.

945
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,631
Well, l haven't seen you.

946
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:24,011
l don't think l would have told you
even if l had seen you.

947
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,305
Why not?

948
01:10:28,683 --> 01:10:30,726
Because it's not really my place.

949
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:41,320
My life is shit.

950
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:44,948
lt's just shit.

951
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:49,494
Nothing is what l thought it was.

952
01:10:57,962 --> 01:10:59,755
John's a bastard.

953
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:09,514
Let's make a videotape.

954
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:14,478
No, l...

955
01:11:15,897 --> 01:11:17,940
l don't think that's a good idea.

956
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,567
Why not?

957
01:11:21,027 --> 01:11:24,571
Because l don't think it's a choice that
you'd make in a normal frame of mind.

958
01:11:25,657 --> 01:11:28,575
And what would you know
about a normal frame of mind?

959
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,456
That's a good question.

960
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,504
So what do you have to do to get ready?

961
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:47,719
Load a tape and turn on the camera.

962
01:11:50,682 --> 01:11:52,265
Do it.

963
01:12:01,442 --> 01:12:05,946
So, where do you get your money from

964
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:10,409
for rent and tapes, stuff like that?

965
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,870
Underneath my mattress.

966
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,667
And what are you gonna do
when this money runs out?

967
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:20,335
lt won't.

968
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,339
Are you comfortable there?

969
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,884
Yeah, l'm comfortable.

970
01:12:31,973 --> 01:12:35,726
Okay, l'm recording. Tell me your name.

971
01:12:39,313 --> 01:12:41,356
Ann Bishop Mullany.

972
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:15,307
Margaret. Hi, it's John.

973
01:13:15,391 --> 01:13:18,185
Fine. Fine.
Listen, have you seen Ann at all today?

974
01:13:18,269 --> 01:13:19,811
This afternoon?

975
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:24,691
Well, no, l just... She's home.

976
01:13:24,942 --> 01:13:27,277
Bye-bye. Everything's fine. Thanks. Bye.

977
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:30,113
Thank God. You had me worried sick.

978
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:32,657
l come home, the door is open,
the car is gone.

979
01:13:34,786 --> 01:13:37,788
l thought you'd been abducted
by some mad fucker.

980
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:43,335
-Honey, you all right?
-l want out of this marriage.

981
01:13:49,592 --> 01:13:50,967
What?

982
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:58,183
l want out of this marriage.

983
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,901
Why?

984
01:14:10,738 --> 01:14:12,864
You're asking me why?

985
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:18,578
Well, l'm married to you.
You want out of this marriage.

986
01:14:18,663 --> 01:14:20,455
l think you could tell me that.

987
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:26,711
Fuck you.

988
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,759
All right.

989
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:38,640
Can you tell me where you went?

990
01:14:38,724 --> 01:14:42,144
l drove around.
Then l went over to Graham's.

991
01:14:42,228 --> 01:14:43,270
Graham's?

992
01:14:43,855 --> 01:14:44,855
Graham.

993
01:14:50,862 --> 01:14:53,530
Oh, God damn it! That son of a bitch!

994
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:56,741
The backstabbing son of a...
Mr Honesty, huh?

995
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,910
Mr Apostle of Truth!

996
01:15:11,174 --> 01:15:13,383
Well, l know you didn't fuck him.

997
01:15:24,103 --> 01:15:26,688
Did you make one
of these goddamn videotapes?

998
01:15:32,278 --> 01:15:33,570
Annie...

999
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:38,074
Answer me, God damn it.
God damn it, answer me. Did you?

1000
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:41,536
Yes, l did.

1001
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,624
God!

1002
01:15:46,125 --> 01:15:47,626
Don't you touch him!

1003
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:07,270
Okay. Cool down.

1004
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,483
What?

1005
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:13,860
Hello?

1006
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:19,407
John, what are you...
What the hell are you doing over here?

1007
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,287
Damn.

1008
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,871
Okay, l'm recording.

1009
01:17:09,583 --> 01:17:11,209
Tell me your name.

1010
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:16,715
Ann Bishop Mullany.

1011
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:20,593
So what do you want to talk about?

1012
01:17:20,678 --> 01:17:21,970
What do you usually
talk about on these tapes?

1013
01:17:22,054 --> 01:17:24,139
Sex.

1014
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:26,683
Okay. Let's talk about sex.

1015
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,894
Do you have sex?

1016
01:17:30,604 --> 01:17:32,397
Not very often. No.

1017
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:37,068
When you do, who usually initiates it?

1018
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:39,237
He does.

1019
01:17:42,074 --> 01:17:44,200
ls the sex satisfying?

1020
01:17:49,582 --> 01:17:51,041
l don't know.

1021
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:54,753
l don't know. l don't know what you mean.

1022
01:17:57,381 --> 01:17:58,882
Do you have orgasms?

1023
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:02,052
l don't think so.

1024
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:06,931
l mean, l guess since l'm not sure
that l've never had one, l...

1025
01:18:27,286 --> 01:18:30,955
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

1026
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,712
Here we go.

1027
01:18:45,471 --> 01:18:48,056
-Why don't we stop?
-No.

1028
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,641
l don't wanna stop.

1029
01:18:58,901 --> 01:19:02,779
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

1030
01:19:03,656 --> 01:19:05,490
l've thought about it.

1031
01:19:06,784 --> 01:19:09,369
-Did you act on it?
-No.

1032
01:19:11,080 --> 01:19:12,414
Why not?

1033
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,334
Because that's how Cynthia thinks.

1034
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:20,213
l hate it when l have feelings that she has.

1035
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:27,095
lt bothers me when l think about men,
because l know that's the way she thinks.

1036
01:19:31,517 --> 01:19:33,643
What other men have you thought about?

1037
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,774
l thought about you.

1038
01:19:42,695 --> 01:19:46,156
-Have you thought about me?
-Yes.

1039
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:53,121
What did you think?

1040
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,960
l thought about what you would look like
having an orgasm.

1041
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:10,555
l'd like to know what l look like
having an orgasm.

1042
01:20:16,645 --> 01:20:19,898
Can you do that, give a woman an orgasm?

1043
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,487
Yes.

1044
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,323
Could you do that for me?

1045
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:33,411
No.

1046
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,414
Why not?

1047
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:40,752
-Because l can't.
-Can't or won't?

1048
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:42,670
l can't because l won't.

1049
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:54,682
You said you weren't always impotent.

1050
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:57,602
No. Yeah, that's correct.

1051
01:20:59,063 --> 01:21:02,398
-So you have had sex?
-Yes.

1052
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:06,861
So, what happened?

1053
01:21:06,946 --> 01:21:09,864
Was it so bad it turned you off, or...

1054
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:16,037
-No, that wasn't my problem.
-What was the problem?

1055
01:21:16,497 --> 01:21:18,831
l was the problem. l was a...

1056
01:21:21,752 --> 01:21:23,670
l was a pathological liar.

1057
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:27,340
Or l am, l should say.

1058
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:29,801
Lying is...

1059
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:36,224
Lying is like alcoholism.
You're continually recovering, you know.

1060
01:21:37,518 --> 01:21:39,018
So that's it?

1061
01:21:40,354 --> 01:21:41,813
You lied?

1062
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:48,027
-That was part of it.
-So what else happened?

1063
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:53,658
Well, at that time, l...

1064
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,833
l used to express my feelings nonverbally

1065
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,048
and often scared people

1066
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:13,344
who were close to me.

1067
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,347
Are you still like that?

1068
01:22:18,517 --> 01:22:22,687
No.

1069
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:30,570
So you're never gonna make love again.

1070
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:33,698
l don't know. l haven't made any plans.

1071
01:22:40,456 --> 01:22:43,207
lf you were in love with me, would you?

1072
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,126
-l'm not in love with you.
-But if you were.

1073
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,711
l can't answer that.

1074
01:22:46,795 --> 01:22:48,630
-Why not?
-l told you.

1075
01:22:48,714 --> 01:22:50,923
-l don't understand.
-Ann...

1076
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,052
Forget about the sex, you know.

1077
01:22:56,513 --> 01:22:59,766
l'm not the same person that l was,
even remotely.

1078
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:02,060
You know, l'm different in so many ways

1079
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:06,064
that have a profound effect on the way
that l relate to other people,

1080
01:23:06,148 --> 01:23:07,982
the way l communicate.

1081
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,734
l mean, this, for instance.

1082
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:13,154
l mean, the way she and l are talking,
that could never have been possible.

1083
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,658
"She? The way she and l are talking"?

1084
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,868
"She"? Who's "she"?

1085
01:23:18,952 --> 01:23:20,995
l'm sorry, l was...

1086
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,164
l was... That isn't what l was doing.

1087
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:26,542
She's Elizabeth? ls that who it is?

1088
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:30,213
ls that the girl that John talked about?
ls that who it is?

1089
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,388
l guess. l guess.

1090
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:42,850
-So you're still in contact with her, then.
-l'm sorry.

1091
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,687
-With Elizabeth?
-No, l'm...

1092
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:50,274
So what do you think Elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes?

1093
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:55,279
l can't imagine her being too understanding.

1094
01:23:57,574 --> 01:24:02,203
But you're gonna tell her about them, right?
Since you don't lie any more.

1095
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:04,580
As l said, l don't

1096
01:24:07,126 --> 01:24:09,544
know what l'm gonna do exactly. l mean...

1097
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:13,381
Perhaps l won't do anything. l don't...

1098
01:24:13,465 --> 01:24:17,176
So you just came back here
so that you could think about it.

1099
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:20,471
No. l moved back here for some...

1100
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,145
A sense of closure, you know?

1101
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,317
A resolution of some sort.

1102
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:44,162
l wanted somebody
who is very important to me

1103
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,540
to understand that, l guess.

1104
01:24:48,167 --> 01:24:49,584
That's...

1105
01:24:51,128 --> 01:24:52,503
That's pathetic.

1106
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:59,469
l mean, you can't just...
My God, Graham, you...

1107
01:24:59,887 --> 01:25:03,639
You just can't walk up to her
and show her you've changed,

1108
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,850
like it's some gift or something.

1109
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,689
And look what you've changed into.

1110
01:25:14,193 --> 01:25:15,568
Nine years.

1111
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:19,030
Nine years,
and this is what you come up with.

1112
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:23,367
ls this what you wanna be
the rest of your life?

1113
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,706
Why are you doing this?

1114
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:35,046
Can you tell me that?
Why are you doing this to yourself?

1115
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,968
-You gonna answer me?
-No, please, don't do that.

1116
01:25:41,053 --> 01:25:42,637
-Why not?
-No, really, don't do that.

1117
01:25:42,721 --> 01:25:43,930
Why not?
l just wanna ask you a few questions.

1118
01:25:44,014 --> 01:25:46,641
Like why do you tape women
talking about sex?

1119
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:49,727
-Why do you do that? Can you tell me why?
-l can't tell you like this.

1120
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:53,356
Come on. l'm just gonna keep asking.

1121
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:56,150
Ann, l just don't find the turning-the-tables
thing very interesting.

1122
01:25:56,235 --> 01:25:58,444
Well, l do. Tell me why, Graham.

1123
01:25:59,238 --> 01:26:02,907
-Why?
-What? What do you want me to tell you?

1124
01:26:03,116 --> 01:26:04,700
"Tell me why? Why?"

1125
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,746
Ann, you don't even know who l am.

1126
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,332
You don't have the slightest idea who l am.

1127
01:26:16,046 --> 01:26:19,423
Am l supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment,

1128
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:23,970
and then just hope that it's coherent,
that it makes some sort of sense to you?

1129
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,847
lt doesn't make any sense to me.

1130
01:26:25,931 --> 01:26:28,057
l was there.

1131
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:30,017
l don't have the slightest idea who l am,

1132
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:33,104
and l'm supposed to be able
to explain it to you.

1133
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,567
And why? You tell me why.

1134
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,528
Why do l have to explain myself to you?

1135
01:26:40,612 --> 01:26:42,613
Because maybe l can help you.

1136
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:47,285
-Help me with what?
-Your problem.

1137
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:51,497
My problem? Do l have a problem?

1138
01:26:51,582 --> 01:26:57,128
l look around me in this town and
l see John and Cynthia and you, and l...

1139
01:26:58,589 --> 01:27:00,548
l feel comparatively healthy.

1140
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,513
You've got a problem.

1141
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:13,477
You're right.

1142
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:22,320
l've got a lot of problems.

1143
01:27:30,954 --> 01:27:32,830
And they belong to me.

1144
01:27:36,376 --> 01:27:38,502
You think they're yours, but they're not.

1145
01:27:40,005 --> 01:27:44,300
Everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem.

1146
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,677
Anybody that comes in contact with you.

1147
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:53,267
l didn't want to be part of your problem,
but l am.

1148
01:27:54,937 --> 01:27:57,104
l'm leaving my husband.

1149
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:01,150
And maybe l would have anyway,
but the fact is l'm doing it now.

1150
01:28:04,029 --> 01:28:06,030
And part of it is because of you.

1151
01:28:12,371 --> 01:28:14,372
You've had an effect on my life.

1152
01:28:20,087 --> 01:28:21,879
This isn't supposed to happen.

1153
01:28:27,094 --> 01:28:32,056
l've spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didn't happen.

1154
01:32:28,752 --> 01:32:32,630
You know, l never told you this
'cause l knew it would crush you.

1155
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:37,009
But now...

1156
01:32:38,470 --> 01:32:41,805
l fucked Elizabeth before you broke up,

1157
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:45,559
before you were having trouble, even.

1158
01:32:47,938 --> 01:32:50,731
She's no saint. She's good in bed.

1159
01:32:52,901 --> 01:32:54,818
She could keep a secret.

1160
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,240
That's about all l can say about her.

1161
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,008
-l gotta make a call.
-Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

1162
01:34:02,679 --> 01:34:05,848
-Brian Kirkland's office.
-Yeah, John Mullany for Brian Kirkland.

1163
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:08,225
-Just one moment, please.
-All right.

1164
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:12,104
Anyway, as l've always said, work is critical.

1165
01:34:12,314 --> 01:34:16,108
l can be happy without a marriage,
but if you take away my work...

1166
01:34:16,192 --> 01:34:21,572
l mean, that's different.
And ifAnn can't handle that,

1167
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:25,868
well, that's her problem.

1168
01:34:27,078 --> 01:34:28,537
-Mr Mullany.
-Yeah?

1169
01:34:28,621 --> 01:34:30,372
Mr DeForest would like
to see you in his office.

1170
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:32,583
All right. ln a minute. l'm on with a client.

1171
01:34:32,667 --> 01:34:34,293
He said immediately.

1172
01:34:34,377 --> 01:34:36,795
All right. Jesus.

1173
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:38,505
-Mr Mullany.
-Yeah.

1174
01:34:38,590 --> 01:34:40,841
Mr Kirkland has asked me to inform you

1175
01:34:40,925 --> 01:34:43,177
that he's obtained
legal representation elsewhere.

1176
01:34:43,261 --> 01:34:46,347
And that if you have a message
for Mr Kirkland, you could leave it with me.

1177
01:34:46,431 --> 01:34:47,931
Thank you.

1178
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:52,686
-No message.
-All right, Mr Mullany.

1179
01:34:52,771 --> 01:34:54,021
Thank you.

1180
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:56,732
Fool. Well...

1181
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,194
Hope he knows what he's doing.

1182
01:35:00,278 --> 01:35:02,196
-Mr Mullany.
-Yeah.

1183
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,530
Mr DeForest is waiting.

1184
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:06,617
All right. Tell him l'll be in, in a minute.

1185
01:35:06,701 --> 01:35:11,455
Jesus. The old man thinks that
the world revolves around a game of golf.

1186
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,916
Listen, why don't l catch up to you
at the courts in a few minutes?

1187
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,251
-l'd better go talk to DeForest.
-Sure.

1188
01:35:17,587 --> 01:35:18,587
Okay.

1189
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,679
Fuck.

1190
01:35:47,325 --> 01:35:49,701
No, just one's fine. Thanks.

1191
01:35:52,914 --> 01:35:54,998
This is my favourite part.

1192
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:01,922
You know what l was thinking?

1193
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,882
l was thinking
we should name our first child Rusty.

1194
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,968
