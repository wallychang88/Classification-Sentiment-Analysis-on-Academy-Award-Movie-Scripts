<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

114
00:10:20,688 --> 00:10:23,022
<font color=#FCFCFC>Did she just say "working"?</font>

115

<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

116
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,092
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm sorry it didn't
go well today,</font>

117
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,695

<font color=#FCFCFC>It'll be fun.</font>

120
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,834
<font color=#FCFCFC>- It's not gonna be fun.
- It could be.</font>

121
00:10:34,835 --> 00:10:37,169
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's not. It's gonna be a
bunch of social climbers,</font>

122
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,706
<font color=#FCFCFC>all packed into one of
those big glass houses.</font>

123
00:10:39,707 --> 00:10:41,173
<font color=#FCFCFC>This looks familiar.</font>

124
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,710
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?</font>

125
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,912
<font color=#FCFCFC>- A long time.
- Come on, Mia.</font>

126
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:46,946
<font color=#FCFCFC>When else are you
gonna get to see</font>

127
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:49,215
<font color=#FCFCFC>every Hollywood cliche
crammed into the same room?</font>

185
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,693
<font color=#FCFCFC>The Baked Potato
just threw it away.</font>

186
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:48,860
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can't imagine why.</font>

187
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,429
<font color=#FCFCFC>And now you're just
sitting on it.</font>

188
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,463
<font color=#FCFCFC>I got you a throw rug.</font>

189
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,631
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't need that.</font>

190
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,467
<font color=#FCFCFC>What if I said Miles
Davis pissed on it?</font>

191
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,570
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's almost insulting.
Is it true?</font>

192
00:18:58,571 --> 00:19:01,307
<font color=#FCFCFC>When are you gonna
unpack these boxes?</font>

193
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,808
<font color=#FCFCFC>When I unpack them
in my own club.</font>

194
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,109
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, Sebastian.</font>

195
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:06,812
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's like a girl broke up with
you and you're stalking her.</font>

by there, are you?</font>

00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:10,982
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's...</font>

198
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,451
<font color=#FCFCFC>You won't believe
that they turned it</font>

199
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:13,485
<font color=#FCFCFC>into a samba-tapas place.</font>

200
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,686
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, my God, Sebastian!</font>

201
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:17,223
<font color=#FCFCFC>Samba. Tapas.</font>

202
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:19,758
<font color=#FCFCFC>Pick one, you know?
Do one right.</font>

203
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:21,693
<font color=#FCFCFC>I have someone I
want you to meet.</font>

204
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:23,629
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I don't wanna meet anyone.
- Yeah.</font>

205
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:24,630
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, no, I don't
wanna meet anyone.</font>

206
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:25,831
<font color=#FCFCFC>Dad gave you this?</font>

207
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,333
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yes.
- You'll like her.</font>

208
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:28,767
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't think I'm
gonna like her.</font>

209
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:30,536
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Does she like jazz?
- Probably not.</font>

210
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:31,770
<font color=#FCFCFC>Then what are we
gonna talk about?</font>

211
00:19:31,771 --> 00:19:33,672
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't know! It doesn't matter.
Okay?</font>

212
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,507
<font color=#FCFCFC>Because you're living
like a hermit.</font>

213
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,975
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're driving
without insurance!</font>

214
00:19:36,976 --> 00:19:38,677
<font color=#FCFCFC>- It doesn't matter?
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.</font>

215
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,496
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Okay.
- You need to get serious.</font>

216
00:19:39,566 --> 00:19:40,211
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, I know a guy with</font>

217
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,048
<font color=#FCFCFC>- a face tattoo that you should see.
- Okay, low blow.</font>

218
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,515
<font color=#FCFCFC>- With a heart of gold.
- Get serious!</font>

219
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,518
<font color=#FCFCFC>"Get serious"? Laura...</font>

220
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,122
<font color=#FCFCFC>I had a very serious
plan for my future.</font>

221
00:19:49,123 --> 00:19:49,473
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know.</font>

222
00:19:49,543 --> 00:19:51,490
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's not my fault
I got shanghaied.</font>

223
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:54,660
<font color=#FCFCFC>You didn't get shanghaied.
You got ripped off!</font>

224
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:55,994
<font color=#FCFCFC>What's the difference?</font>

225
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:58,897
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't know. It's not
as romantic as that.</font>

226
00:19:58,898 --> 00:19:59,899
<font color=#FCFCFC>Don't sit...</font>

227
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,970
<font color=#FCFCFC>Everybody knew that guy
was shady except for you.</font>

228
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,674
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?</font>

229
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:12,444
<font color=#FCFCFC>Unpaid bills are not romantic.
Call her.</font>

230
00:20:12,445 --> 00:20:13,812
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm not gonna call her.</font>

231
00:20:13,813 --> 00:20:15,481
<font color=#FCFCFC>And the thing is...</font>

232
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,649
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're acting like life's
got me on the ropes.</font>

233
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,386
<font color=#FCFCFC>I want to be on the ropes.
Okay? I'm just...</font>

234
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:21,920
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm letting life hit
me 'til it gets tired.</font>

235
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:24,390
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Oh?
- Then I'm gonna hit back.</font>

236
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,958
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's a classic rope-a-dope.</font>

237
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,529
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, Ali. I love you.
Unpack the boxes.</font>

238
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,697
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm gonna change the locks.</font>

239
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,132
<font color=#FCFCFC>You can't afford it.</font>

240
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,003
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm a phoenix, rising
from the ashes.</font>

241
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:26,051
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hey.</font>

242
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:27,285
<font color=#FCFCFC>Bill. Thanks for having me back.</font>

243
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,520
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're welcome.</font>

244
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,588
<font color=#FCFCFC>Want you to know you're
looking at a new man.</font>

245
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,889
<font color=#FCFCFC>A man that's happy to be here.</font>

246
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,391
<font color=#FCFCFC>Good. Excellent.</font>

247
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,592
<font color=#FCFCFC>Very-easy-to-work-with man.</font>

248
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,026
<font color=#FCFCFC>And you're going to
play the set list?</font>

249
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,762
<font color=#FCFCFC>Happy to.</font>

250
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:37,963
<font color=#FCFCFC>Even though I don't think</font>

251
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:39,631
<font color=#FCFCFC>anyone cares what I
play, but, yeah...</font>

252
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:41,533
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, if by "anyone,"</font>

253
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,435
<font color=#FCFCFC>you mean anyone other than
me, that would be correct.</font>

254
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:44,970
<font color=#FCFCFC>I care, and I don't wanna
hear the free jazz.</font>

255
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:47,473
<font color=#FCFCFC>Right. Okay.</font>

256
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,940
<font color=#FCFCFC>Although I thought in this town</font>

257
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,076
<font color=#FCFCFC>it worked on a sort of</font>

258
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:52,644
<font color=#FCFCFC>"one for you, one for
me" type system.</font>

259
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,446
<font color=#FCFCFC>How 'bout two for
you, one for me?</font>

260
00:21:55,915 --> 00:21:57,649
<font color=#FCFCFC>How 'bout all for you
and none for me?</font>

261
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,050
<font color=#FCFCFC>- That's perfect, yes.
- Great.</font>

262
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,686
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Okay.
- Mutual decision, then.</font>

263
00:22:00,687 --> 00:22:02,454
<font color=#FCFCFC>Right. Made by me.</font>

264
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:04,623
<font color=#FCFCFC>Right. And I sign
of on it, so...</font>

265
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:07,125
<font color=#FCFCFC>Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.</font>

266
00:22:07,126 --> 00:22:09,161
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well. Welcome back.</font>

267
00:22:10,763 --> 00:22:12,699
<font color=#FCFCFC>There's a nice way
to say that, Karen.</font>

268
00:25:15,782 --> 00:25:17,049
<font color=#FCFCFC>Seb.</font>

269
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,763
<font color=#FCFCFC>I knew, I did hear
what you're saying,</font>

270
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,198
<font color=#FCFCFC>but I don't think you're
saying what you mean.</font>

271
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:35,266
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.</font>

272
00:25:35,267 --> 00:25:36,267
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, that's what you're saying,</font>

273
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,103
<font color=#FCFCFC>but it's not what you mean.
What you mean is...</font>

274
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:39,304
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're fired.</font>

275
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,740
<font color=#FCFCFC>"Play the set list."</font>

276
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:44,009
<font color=#FCFCFC>- No, I'm saying it's too late.
- It's a warning.</font>

277
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,677
<font color=#FCFCFC>What planet are you from?</font>

278
00:25:45,678 --> 00:25:46,745
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Don't fire me, Bill.
- You're done.</font>

279
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,313
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Don't fire me.
- I'm sorry, Seb.</font>

280
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,815
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's Christmas.</font>

281
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:51,216
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, I see the decorations.</font>

282
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,184
<font color=#FCFCFC>Good luck in the New Year.</font>

283
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,201
<font color=#FCFCFC>I just heard you play
and I want to...</font>

284
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:26,652
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't like the fissure

<font color=#FCFCFC>Why?</font>

356

00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:27,525
<font color=#FCFCFC>He doesn't... I don't...</font>

369
00:30:27,526 --> 00:30:29,027
<font color=#FCFCFC>He doesn't tell me what to do.</font>

370
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:30,261
<font color=#FCFCFC>He just told you what to do.</font>

371
00:30:30,262 --> 00:30:32,063
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know. I let him.</font>

372
00:30:32,064 --> 00:30:33,031
<font color=#FCFCFC>What's your name?</font>

373
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:34,900
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Mia.
- Mia.</font>

374
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:38,269
<font color=#FCFCFC>Guess I'll see you
in the movies.</font>

375
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,539
<font color=#FCFCFC>You heard of Joseph Campbell?</font>

376
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,974
<font color=#FCFCFC>Uh, yeah.</font>

377
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,075
<font color=#FCFCFC>I have this idea
to do a re-imagine</font>

the Three Bears."</font>

379
00:30:45,211 --> 00:30:47,312
<font color=#FCFCFC>But from the perspective
of the bears.</font>

380
00:30:47,313 --> 00:30:49,047
<font color=#FCFCFC>- The Hero's Journey.
- It could be like a franchise.</font>

381
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,148
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Right.
- So we don't know.</font>

382
00:30:50,149 --> 00:30:51,582
<font color=#FCFCFC>There could have been a
fourth bear, we don't know.</font>

- Yeah, yeah.</font>

386
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,995
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know that guy. Did
you get your keys?</font>

387
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:07,398
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mmm-hmm, yes.</font>

388
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:08,566
<font color=#FCFCFC>Can you grab mine?</font>

389
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,035
<font color=#FCFCFC>Can I what?</font>

390
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,469
<font color=#FCFCFC>Would you be able to grab mine?
My keys?</font>

391
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,603
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I can't hear.
- Sorry.</font>

392
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,039
<font color=#FCFCFC>Can you grab my keys?</font>

393
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,640
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh.</font>

394
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,975
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Please?
- Oh, there we go.</font>

395
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,944
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Thank you.
- You're welcome.</font>

396
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,214
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What kind?
- It's a Prius.</font>

397
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:27,052
<font color=#FCFCFC>Wait a minute. That
doesn't help me.</font>

398
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,419
<font color=#FCFCFC>With a green ribbon.</font>

399
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,888
<font color=#FCFCFC>All right.</font>

400
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,560
<font color=#FCFCFC>Those look, uh, comfortable.</font>

401
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,770
<font color=#FCFCFC>They are.</font>

402
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:40,324
<font color=#FCFCFC>Thank you for saving
the day back there.</font>

403
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,028
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, you didn't really
give me much of a choice.</font>

404
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:49,507
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's pretty strange that we
keep running into each other.</font>

405
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:50,759
<font color=#FCFCFC>It is strange.</font>

406
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:53,778
<font color=#FCFCFC>Maybe it means something.</font>

407
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,113
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.</font>

408
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,157
<font color=#FCFCFC>Where's my car?</font>

409
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:59,517
<font color=#FCFCFC>You gotta put that
thing to your chin.</font>

410
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:01,652
<font color=#FCFCFC>- This?
- Yeah.</font>

411
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,058
<font color=#FCFCFC>It makes your head into</font>

412
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:04,322
<font color=#FCFCFC>- an antenna, so...
- Ooh.</font>

413
00:32:04,323 --> 00:32:05,991
<font color=#FCFCFC>I think it gives you cancer,
but you find your car faster.</font>

414
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:07,125
<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

415
00:32:07,126 --> 00:32:08,193
<font color=#FCFCFC>You don't live as
long, but you get</font>

416
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:10,195
<font color=#FCFCFC>where you're going quicker,
so it all evens out.</font>

417
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,629
<font color=#FCFCFC>That sounds terrible.</font>

418
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,156
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Just a suggestion.
- Uhh...</font>

419

420

423

<font color=#FCFCFC>Hi, Greg. Oh, sorry I'm late.</font>

460
00:36:40,366 --> 00:36:43,034
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah. Be there soon. Okay. Bye.</font>

461
00:37:03,922 --> 00:37:05,756
<font color=#FCFCFC>- It was just right there.
- Just right here.</font>

462
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,898
<font color=#FCFCFC>Do you want a ride to your car?</font>

463
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,601
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, I'm just right up here.</font>

00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:42,954
<font color=#FCFCFC>Excuse me. This is
gluten-free, right?</font>

467
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,055
<font color=#FCFCFC>No.</font>

468
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,425
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What?
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

469
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,960
<font color=#FCFCFC>Ugh! I'd like a refund.</font>

470
00:38:51,397 --> 00:38:53,499
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay. Let me check
on that for you.</font>

471
00:38:54,866 --> 00:38:56,401
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mia...</font>

472
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,636
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Hi.
- You're closing Friday.</font>

473
00:38:58,870 --> 00:39:00,104
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can't close on Friday.</font>

474
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:02,039
<font color=#FCFCFC>I have an audition. Remember?</font>

475
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,041
<font color=#FCFCFC>Do I look like I care?
Reschedule it.</font>

476
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:07,011
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, and we need to have a
little talk tomorrow, okay?</font>

477
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,746
<font color=#FCFCFC>Fix your apron, please.</font>

478
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,747
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

479
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:16,121
<font color=#FCFCFC>You again!</font>

480
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,890
<font color=#FCFCFC>What are you doing here?</font>

481
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:23,160
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, you know, just meetings and...
studio heads and...</font>

482
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:24,161
<font color=#FCFCFC>How'd you get on the lot?</font>

483
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,232
<font color=#FCFCFC>I basically just hauled
ass past the guard gates.</font>

484
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,993
<font color=#FCFCFC>I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.</font>

485
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:32,670
<font color=#FCFCFC>You don't have a break
coming up, do you?</font>

486
00:39:32,671 --> 00:39:33,671
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm off in 10 minutes.</font>

487
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:37,207
<font color=#FCFCFC>Can I hide in the bathroom?</font>

488
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,208
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yes.
- Okay.</font>

489
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:41,912
<font color=#FCFCFC>Sorry.</font>

490
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,380
<font color=#FCFCFC>Um...</font>

491
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,901
<font color=#FCFCFC>I actually do have to check.
I'm sorry.</font>

492
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,755
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's the window that</font>

493
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:51,822
<font color=#FCFCFC>Humphrey Bogart and
Ingrid Bergman</font>

494
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,123
<font color=#FCFCFC>looked out of in Casablanca.</font>

495
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:54,391
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Wow!
- Yeah.</font>

496
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,226
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can't believe you work right
across the street from that.</font>

497
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,295
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah.
- That's amazing.</font>

498
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,766
<font color=#FCFCFC>What was your Bogart's name?</font>

499
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,201
<font color=#FCFCFC>What's his name? Is it Greg?</font>

500
00:40:04,202 --> 00:40:06,403
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah. Greg.</font>

501
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:09,373
<font color=#FCFCFC>Right. How long have you been...</font>

502
00:40:09,374 --> 00:40:11,075
<font color=#FCFCFC>We've been seeing each
other for about a month.</font>

503
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,076
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, that's great.</font>

504
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:14,078
<font color=#FCFCFC>He's, um... He's sweet.</font>

505
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,413
<font color=#FCFCFC>Anyway, I love being around
this stuff, you know?</font>

506
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,748
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know what you mean.</font>

507
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,083
<font color=#FCFCFC>I get coffee 5 miles
out of the way,</font>

508
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,851
<font color=#FCFCFC>just so I can be
near a jazz club.</font>

509
00:40:20,852 --> 00:40:22,286
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yeah, the Van Beek.</font>

510
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,688
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Do you know it?
- Mmm-mmm.</font>

511
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,355
<font color=#FCFCFC>All the big swing bands
used to play there.</font>

512
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,224
<font color=#FCFCFC>Count Basie, Chick Webb.</font>

513
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,295
<font color=#FCFCFC>Anyway, it's a samba-tapas
place now, so...</font>

514
00:40:31,897 --> 00:40:33,430
<font color=#FCFCFC>What's a samba-tapas place?</font>

515
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,933
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's just a samba place
where they serve tapas.</font>

516
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,968
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Oh.
- Yeah, so the joke's on...</font>

517
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:39,369
<font color=#FCFCFC>History?</font>

518
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,971
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't know. That's LA.</font>

519
00:40:40,972 --> 00:40:44,742
<font color=#FCFCFC>They just worship everything
and they value you nothing.</font>

520
00:40:44,743 --> 00:40:46,811
<font color=#FCFCFC>We're about to roll.
Stop, please, guys.</font>

521
00:40:46,812 --> 00:40:48,212
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

522
00:40:48,213 --> 00:40:49,847
<font color=#FCFCFC>- You're rolling?
- Yeah.</font>

523
00:40:49,848 --> 00:40:50,948
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, I know. They shoot movies</font>

524
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,849
<font color=#FCFCFC>on my street all the time,
so I know about movies.</font>

525
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:53,851
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Come this way.
- Great.</font>

526
00:40:53,852 --> 00:40:54,853
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's a lock-down.</font>

527
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:58,055
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I love her!
- And here we go.</font>

528
00:40:58,056 --> 00:40:59,890
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hey! How'd you get
into all this?</font>

529
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,358
<font color=#FCFCFC>And roll!</font>

530
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,893
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Get into what?
- Sound speed!</font>

531
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:04,394
<font color=#FCFCFC>You know, movies, acting...</font>

532
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,396
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Action!
- Oh, um...</font>

533
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:07,965
<font color=#FCFCFC>My aunt was an actress.</font>

534
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,499
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, okay.</font>

535
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,036
<font color=#FCFCFC>She was in a traveling
theater company.</font>

536
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:14,271
<font color=#FCFCFC>I grew up in Boulder
City, Nevada.</font>

537
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,405
<font color=#FCFCFC>So across the street
from my house</font>

538
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:16,874
<font color=#FCFCFC>there was this little library</font>

539
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,408
<font color=#FCFCFC>that had an old movie section.</font>

540
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,244
<font color=#FCFCFC>So she took me</font>

541
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:23,147
<font color=#FCFCFC>and we spent an entire day
watching all these old movies</font>

542
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,415
<font color=#FCFCFC>like Notorious and
Bringing Up Baby,</font>

543
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:27,284
<font color=#FCFCFC>and Casablanca.</font>

544
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,119
<font color=#FCFCFC>- And...
- Cut it there! Cut!</font>

545
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,021
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Check the gate.
- So we can talk now.</font>

546
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:33,157
<font color=#FCFCFC>- She sounds incredible.
- She was incredible.</font>

547
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,492
<font color=#FCFCFC>And I would put on all
these plays in my bedroom,</font>

548
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,128
<font color=#FCFCFC>and it would basically
just be she and I</font>

549
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:40,931
<font color=#FCFCFC>re-enacting those
scenes from the movies.</font>

550
00:41:40,932 --> 00:41:42,266
<font color=#FCFCFC>And then I would
write my own plays.</font>

551
00:41:42,267 --> 00:41:43,401
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Wow.
- Um... Yeah.</font>

552
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:05,923
<font color=#FCFCFC>I love it.</font>

553
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:14,031
<font color=#FCFCFC>So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here</font>

554
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:17,067
<font color=#FCFCFC>and my last audition was for
a teen show pitched as...</font>

555
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:18,969
<font color=#FCFCFC>"Dangerous Minds meets The O.C."</font>

556
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,273
<font color=#FCFCFC>So, yeah, should've
been a lawyer.</font>

557
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:25,109
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause the world
needs more lawyers.</font>

558
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,411
<font color=#FCFCFC>It doesn't need more actresses.</font>

559
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:28,946
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're not just an actress.</font>

560
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:30,414
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean
"just an actress"?</font>

561
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,082
<font color=#FCFCFC>You said it yourself.</font>

562
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:33,984
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're a child
prodigy playwright.</font>

563
00:42:33,985 --> 00:42:35,920
<font color=#FCFCFC>That is not what I said.</font>

564
00:42:35,921 --> 00:42:39,256
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.</font>

565
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:41,125
<font color=#FCFCFC>You could just write your
own roles, you know?</font>

566
00:42:41,126 --> 00:42:43,227
<font color=#FCFCFC>Write something that's as
interesting as you are,</font>

567
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:44,361
<font color=#FCFCFC>and you don't have to
audition for this...</font>

568
00:42:44,362 --> 00:42:46,163
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah.
- Uh, pissy ca-ca.</font>

569
00:42:46,164 --> 00:42:47,364
<font color=#FCFCFC>Look at Louis Armstrong.</font>

570
00:42:47,365 --> 00:42:50,167
<font color=#FCFCFC>He could've just played the marching
band charts that he was given.</font>

571
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,102
<font color=#FCFCFC>- But he didn't do that.
- What did he do?</font>

572
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,337
<font color=#FCFCFC>What did he do?</font>

573
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:54,418
<font color=#FCFCFC>He made history, didn't he?</font>

574
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,540
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, I'm gonna stop auditioning</font>

575
00:42:56,541 --> 00:42:59,509
<font color=#FCFCFC>and I'm gonna make
history instead.</font>

576
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:01,847
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, my work is done here.</font>

577
00:43:03,214 --> 00:43:05,349
<font color=#FCFCFC>I should probably tell
you something now,</font>

578
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,516
<font color=#FCFCFC>just to get it out of the way.</font>

579
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:07,517
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Mmm-hmm?
- I hate jazz.</font>

580
00:43:10,355 --> 00:43:11,521
<font color=#FCFCFC>Are you okay?</font>

581
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,424
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean you hate jazz?</font>

582
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,759
<font color=#FCFCFC>It just means that when I
listen to it, I don't like it.</font>

583
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,160
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, but it's such a blanket
statement, you don't like jazz.</font>

584
00:43:18,997 --> 00:43:20,157
<font color=#FCFCFC>What are you doing right now?</font>

585
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:22,399
<font color=#FCFCFC>Nothing.</font>

586
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,245
<font color=#FCFCFC>I just think that people,
when they say that they,</font>

587
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:44,923
<font color=#FCFCFC>you know, hate jazz...</font>

588
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:49,026
<font color=#FCFCFC>They just... They
don't have context,</font>

589
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:51,261
<font color=#FCFCFC>they don't know where
it comes from.</font>

590
00:43:51,262 --> 00:43:55,165
<font color=#FCFCFC>Jazz was born in a little
flophouse in New Orleans,</font>

591
00:43:55,166 --> 00:43:57,434
<font color=#FCFCFC>and it's just because people
were crammed in there,</font>

592
00:43:57,435 --> 00:43:58,268
<font color=#FCFCFC>they spoke five
different languages,</font>

593
00:43:58,269 --> 00:43:59,403
<font color=#FCFCFC>they couldn't talk
to each other.</font>

594
00:43:59,404 --> 00:44:03,440
<font color=#FCFCFC>The only way they could
communicate was with jazz.</font>

595
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:04,601
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, but what about Kenny G?</font>

596
00:44:06,311 --> 00:44:08,178
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What?
- What about Kenny G?</font>

597
00:44:08,179 --> 00:44:10,147
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean, what about
elevator music?</font>

598
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,582
<font color=#FCFCFC>You know, jazz
music that I know?</font>

599
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,584
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What about it?
- From my life?</font>

600
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:16,987
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Mmm-hmm?
- I just find it relaxing.</font>

601
00:44:16,988 --> 00:44:19,489
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's not relaxing. It's not.
It's not.</font>

602
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,125
<font color=#FCFCFC>Sidney Bechet shot somebody</font>

603
00:44:21,126 --> 00:44:22,559
<font color=#FCFCFC>because they told him
he played a wrong note.</font>

604
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,961
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's hardly relaxing.</font>

605
00:44:23,962 --> 00:44:25,295
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, but where I grew up</font>

606
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:27,532
<font color=#FCFCFC>there was this station
called KJAZZ-103.</font>

607
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:30,167
<font color=#FCFCFC>And people would just
put on that station</font>

608
00:44:30,168 --> 00:44:31,268
<font color=#FCFCFC>when they had a cocktail party.</font>

609
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:32,569
<font color=#FCFCFC>Right.</font>

610
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,471
<font color=#FCFCFC>And everyone would kinda
just talk over it.</font>

611
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:35,973
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know.</font>

612
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,574
<font color=#FCFCFC>- 'Cause it was...
- That's the prob...</font>

613
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:37,986
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, okay.</font>

614
00:44:38,056 --> 00:44:39,476
<font color=#FCFCFC>So I think that's
part of the problem,</font>

615
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:40,444
<font color=#FCFCFC>is that you can't
hear it, you know?</font>

616
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:41,611
<font color=#FCFCFC>You have to see it.</font>

617
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,679
<font color=#FCFCFC>You have to see what's at stake.</font>

618
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,048
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean, look at these fellas.</font>

619
00:44:44,049 --> 00:44:46,383
<font color=#FCFCFC>Look at the sax
player right now.</font>

620
00:44:46,384 --> 00:44:48,652
<font color=#FCFCFC>He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trip.</font>

621
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,487
<font color=#FCFCFC>Every one of these
guys is composing,</font>

622
00:44:50,488 --> 00:44:52,322
<font color=#FCFCFC>they're rearranging,
they're writing.</font>

623
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:53,657
<font color=#FCFCFC>Then they're playing the melody.
They're just...</font>

624
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,225
<font color=#FCFCFC>And now look, the
trumpet player.</font>

625
00:44:55,226 --> 00:44:56,593
<font color=#FCFCFC>He's got his own idea.</font>

626
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,728
<font color=#FCFCFC>And so, it's conflict</font>

627
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,169
<font color=#FCFCFC>and it's compromise,
and it's just...</font>

628
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,967
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's new every time.</font>

629
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,601
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's brand-new every night.</font>

630
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:06,236
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's very, very exciting.</font>

631
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,713
<font color=#FCFCFC>And it's dying. It's dying, Mia.</font>

632
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:18,515
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's dying on the vine.</font>

633
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:21,651
<font color=#FCFCFC>And the world says, "Let it die.
It had its time."</font>

634
00:45:21,652 --> 00:45:23,121
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, not on my watch.</font>

635
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,390
<font color=#FCFCFC>What are you gonna do?</font>

636
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:27,471
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm gonna have my own club.</font>

637
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,260
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yes.</font>

638
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:31,561
<font color=#FCFCFC>We're gonna play
whatever we want,</font>

639
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,263
<font color=#FCFCFC>whenever we want,</font>

640
00:45:33,264 --> 00:45:36,968
<font color=#FCFCFC>however we want, as
long as it's pure jazz.</font>

641
00:45:38,503 --> 00:45:39,837
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hi, this is Mia Dolan.</font>

642
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:41,672
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, I just missed a call.</font>

643
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,414
<font color=#FCFCFC>I got a callback!</font>

644
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:52,182
<font color=#FCFCFC>What? Come on!</font>

645
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:53,783
<font color=#FCFCFC>For what?</font>

646
00:45:53,784 --> 00:45:57,154
<font color=#FCFCFC>For a TV show. The one I was
telling you about earlier.</font>

647
00:45:57,155 --> 00:45:58,744
<font color=#FCFCFC>The "Dangerous Minds
meets The O.C."?</font>

648
00:45:58,814 --> 00:45:59,256
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah.</font>

649
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:00,190
<font color=#FCFCFC>Congratulations!</font>

650
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,391
<font color=#FCFCFC>- That's incredible!
- It's really exciting.</font>

651
00:46:01,392 --> 00:46:03,544
<font color=#FCFCFC>I feel like I said negative
stuff about it before.</font>

652
00:46:03,546 --> 00:46:04,261
<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

653
00:46:04,262 --> 00:46:06,063
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's like Rebel Without
A Cause, sort of.</font>

654
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,532
<font color=#FCFCFC>"I got the bullets!"</font>

655
00:46:08,533 --> 00:46:09,567
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yes.</font>

656
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,370
<font color=#FCFCFC>- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.</font>

657
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:15,805
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, my! You know, it's
playing at the Rialto.</font>

658
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,407
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yes.</font>

659
00:46:17,408 --> 00:46:20,577
<font color=#FCFCFC>You should go... I
mean, I can take you.</font>

660
00:46:20,578 --> 00:46:21,829
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

661
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,447
<font color=#FCFCFC>- You know, for research.
- For research.</font>

662
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:24,299
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah.
- Yeah.</font>

663
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:25,300
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

664
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,484
<font color=#FCFCFC>Um, Monday night, 10:00 o'clock.</font>

665
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:29,319
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah. Great.
- Okay.</font>

666
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,156

- Thank you.</font>

683
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,273
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Oh...
- Thanks.</font>

684
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,708
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can do it a different way.</font>

685
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:06,589
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, that's fine. Thank you very much.
Thank you.</font>

686
00:49:14,985 --> 00:49:16,453
<font color=#FCFCFC>That was fun. Thanks.</font>

687
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:17,454
<font color=#FCFCFC>Bye.</font>

688
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:48,018
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, hey, Mia?</font>

689
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,520
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Hey.
- Greg's here.</font>

690
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:51,888
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean...</font>

691
00:49:51,889 --> 00:49:55,024
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hey, babe. Got a
space out front.</font>

692
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,926
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Great. Okay...
- We should get going.</font>

693
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:58,195
<font color=#FCFCFC>My brother landed really early.</font>

694
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:02,699
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Did you forget?
- Shit.</font>

695
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:03,767
<font color=#FCFCFC>You forgot.</font>

696
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,802
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's tonight.</font>

697
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:07,705
<font color=#FCFCFC>- That's okay.
- Yeah. Okay.</font>

698
00:50:07,706 --> 00:50:08,305
<font color=#FCFCFC>You forgot.</font>

699
00:50:08,306 --> 00:50:09,706
<font color=#FCFCFC>All right, so then
I'll just get changed.</font>

700
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,309
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Okay. Great.
- Okay. Great.</font>

701
00:50:14,745 --> 00:50:15,812
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah, that's him.
- Um...</font>

702
00:50:15,813 --> 00:50:17,947
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hey, Josh, yeah. Uh...</font>

703
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:20,585
<font color=#FCFCFC>Just pickin' up Mia. We'll
be there in, like a...</font>

704
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,320
<font color=#FCFCFC>But now we've got this</font>

705
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:24,393
<font color=#FCFCFC>surround-sound set-up,
so it's like...</font>

706
00:50:24,417 --> 00:50:25,054
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's like being...</font>

707
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,823
<font color=#FCFCFC>- in a movie theater.
- Wow.</font>

708
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:28,458
<font color=#FCFCFC>But better than being
in a theater, really.</font>

709
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:30,294
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I can't wait.
- You know theaters these days.</font>

710
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:32,028
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.</font>

711
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,763
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, I know. And so smelly.</font>

712
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,399
<font color=#FCFCFC>And they're either
too hot or too cold.</font>

713
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,833
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know. The quality's
really fallen off.</font>

714
00:50:36,834 --> 00:50:38,302
<font color=#FCFCFC>The quality's terrible.</font>

715
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:39,369
<font color=#FCFCFC>And there's always
people talking.</font>

716
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:40,737
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause of all of the
people seeing the movie.</font>

717
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:41,905
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Which is just...
- Oh, it's the worst!</font>

718
00:50:41,906 --> 00:50:42,772
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, I'm sorry.</font>

719
00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:44,173
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Hold on one second.
- The texting.</font>

720
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,376
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hello?</font>

721
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:47,911
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Probably work.
- Mmm.</font>

722
00:50:47,912 --> 00:50:51,647
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'll call him now,
thank you, thank you.</font>

723
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:56,920
<font color=#FCFCFC>Sorry. So, yeah, we love it.
Oh, it's so nice.</font>

724
00:50:56,921 --> 00:50:58,087
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, we have to come. Maybe.</font>

725
00:50:58,088 --> 00:50:59,624
<font color=#FCFCFC>You should. Come by.</font>

726
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:19,075
<font color=#FCFCFC>I got one word for you, man.</font>

727
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,445
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Mmm-hmm?
- Indonesia.</font>

728
00:51:21,446 --> 00:51:23,380
<font color=#FCFCFC>Never heard anyone say that.</font>

729
00:51:23,381 --> 00:51:24,581
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't even know. I
can't keep track of it,</font>

730
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,082
<font color=#FCFCFC>but honestly it was
life-changing.</font>

731
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,050
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

732
00:51:27,051 --> 00:51:28,552
<font color=#FCFCFC>It affected me.</font>

733
00:51:28,553 --> 00:51:31,355
<font color=#FCFCFC>- It was incredible.
- Is it amazing?</font>

734
00:51:31,356 --> 00:51:33,490
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yes.
- A 5-star jungle eco-resort</font>

735
00:51:33,491 --> 00:51:35,425
<font color=#FCFCFC>- you would not believe.
- Amazing.</font>

736
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:36,493
<font color=#FCFCFC>We were thinking
about Nicaragua,</font>

737
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:37,661
<font color=#FCFCFC>the thing about Nicaragua</font>

738
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,563
<font color=#FCFCFC>is it's less developed. It's
a little under-developed.</font>

739
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:40,764
<font color=#FCFCFC>- You know...
- Right.</font>

740
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,366
<font color=#FCFCFC>I think there's a little more...</font>

741
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,701
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, then, I just don't
know if it's safe.</font>

742
00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:46,403
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah, yeah. It's...
- I don't know if it's safe.</font>

743
00:51:46,404 --> 00:51:47,171
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, you don't want
to explore too far.</font>

744
00:51:47,172 --> 00:51:49,012
<font color=#FCFCFC>Kind of a "natives are
restless" sort of thing.</font>

745
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:54,579
<font color=#FCFCFC>Actually, China's going
to build a Panama Canal.</font>

746
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:18,669
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm sorry.</font>

747
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,500
<font color=#FCFCFC>The immensity of our universe.</font>

748
00:53:56,501 --> 00:53:59,135
<font color=#FCFCFC>For many days before
the end of our Earth,</font>

749
00:53:59,136 --> 00:54:01,438
<font color=#FCFCFC>people will look into the
night sky and notice a star</font>

750
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:05,542
<font color=#FCFCFC>increasingly bright and
increasingly near.</font>

751
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,777
<font color=#FCFCFC>As this star approaches us...</font>

752
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:10,013
<font color=#FCFCFC>Jim Stark.</font>

753
00:54:11,749 --> 00:54:13,783
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'll go find a place. I'm sorry.</font>

754
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:15,018
<font color=#FCFCFC>As this star approaches us,</font>

755
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,019
<font color=#FCFCFC>the weather will change.</font>

756
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:19,523
<font color=#FCFCFC>The great polar fields
of the North and South</font>

757
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:21,257
<font color=#FCFCFC>will rot and divide,</font>

758
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:22,827
<font color=#FCFCFC>and the seas will turn warm.</font>

759
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:26,062
<font color=#FCFCFC>The last of us
search the heavens</font>

760
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,964
<font color=#FCFCFC>and stand amazed,</font>

761
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:30,734
<font color=#FCFCFC>for the stars will still
be there and will be...</font>

762
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,248
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mmm...</font>

763
00:54:47,985 --> 00:54:49,086
<font color=#FCFCFC>I have an idea.</font>

764
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,896
<font color=#FCFCFC>What is that? Is it a script?</font>

765
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,231
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's a play.</font>

766
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:31,234
<font color=#FCFCFC>A play? You better
give us all roles!</font>

767
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:34,071
<font color=#FCFCFC>Actually, it's a one-woman show!
So I can't.</font>

768
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,445
<font color=#FCFCFC>Wow. Is that gonna
happen every time?</font>

769
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:43,814
<font color=#FCFCFC>I think so.</font>

770
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:01,131
<font color=#FCFCFC>Ahh! It's one-way!</font>

771
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,574
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I love you.
- I love you, too.</font>

772
01:02:34,518 --> 01:02:35,619
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh!</font>

773
01:02:38,522 --> 01:02:39,522
<font color=#FCFCFC>Sebastian?</font>

774
01:02:43,660 --> 01:02:45,194
<font color=#FCFCFC>Keith.</font>

775
01:02:45,195 --> 01:02:46,195
<font color=#FCFCFC>Come here, man.</font>

776
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:50,199
<font color=#FCFCFC>- How are you?
- I've been good, man.</font>

777
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,035
<font color=#FCFCFC>This is Mia. Mia, Keith.</font>

778
01:02:52,036 --> 01:02:53,436
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hi, Mia. Nice to meet you.</font>

779
01:02:53,437 --> 01:02:55,704
<font color=#FCFCFC>Nice to meet you. I used
to play with this guy.</font>

780
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,473
<font color=#FCFCFC>Went to school together.</font>

781
01:02:57,474 --> 01:02:59,408
<font color=#FCFCFC>- So how you been, brother?
- Great.</font>

782
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:00,809
<font color=#FCFCFC>Never been better.
How 'bout you?</font>

783
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:02,378
<font color=#FCFCFC>I been really good.
Been very busy.</font>

784
01:03:02,379 --> 01:03:03,612
<font color=#FCFCFC>I got a new combo.</font>

785
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,314
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay. Cool.</font>

786
01:03:05,315 --> 01:03:06,583
<font color=#FCFCFC>We're looking for keys.</font>

787
01:03:08,185 --> 01:03:10,119
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding you.</font>

788
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:13,256
<font color=#FCFCFC>- No, I'm good.
- Are you sure? It pays.</font>

789
01:03:13,557 --> 01:03:15,491
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm good.</font>

790
01:03:15,492 --> 01:03:17,793
<font color=#FCFCFC>Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.</font>

791
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,095
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay. Nice to meet you, Mia.</font>

792
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:20,096
<font color=#FCFCFC>Nice to meet you.</font>

793
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:31,308
<font color=#FCFCFC>"The End."</font>

794
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,281
<font color=#FCFCFC>Genius.</font>

795
01:03:38,282 --> 01:03:39,415
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yes.</font>

796
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,616
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yes.</font>

797
01:03:40,617 --> 01:03:42,218
<font color=#FCFCFC>It feels really nostalgic to me.</font>

798
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:43,352
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Is it too nostalgic?
- That's the point.</font>

799
01:03:43,353 --> 01:03:44,353
<font color=#FCFCFC>Are people gonna like it?</font>

800
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,490
<font color=#FCFCFC>Fuck 'em.</font>

801
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:48,524
<font color=#FCFCFC>You always say that.</font>

802
01:03:48,525 --> 01:03:50,759
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, I truly believe it.</font>

803
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,261
<font color=#FCFCFC>I made you something.</font>

804
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,429
<font color=#FCFCFC>For what?</font>

805
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,665
<font color=#FCFCFC>For your club.</font>

806
01:03:57,467 --> 01:03:58,701
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why does it say "Seb's"?</font>

807
01:03:58,702 --> 01:03:59,602
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause I think you
should call it "Seb's."</font>

808
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:00,170
<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

809
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:02,638
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause no one's gonna come
to "Chicken On A Stick."</font>

810
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:04,640
<font color=#FCFCFC>Is that a music note
as an apostrophe?</font>

811
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:05,642
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yes!
- That's pretty cool.</font>

812
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:06,242
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah.</font>

813
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,603
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's gotta be
"Chicken On A Stick."</font>

814
01:04:08,245 --> 01:04:10,146
<font color=#FCFCFC>Because Charlie Parker
got his nickname...</font>

815
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:11,427
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know, because
he loved chicken.</font>

816
01:04:13,650 --> 01:04:15,818
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's why they
called him "Bird."</font>

817
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:17,220
<font color=#FCFCFC>So I'm gonna have
chicken, beer, jazz...</font>

818
01:04:17,221 --> 01:04:18,654
<font color=#FCFCFC>"Chicken On A Stick."</font>

819
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:20,189
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know. You should
drop the chicken</font>

820
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,191
<font color=#FCFCFC>and just have drinks and
jazz, and also their...</font>

821
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:23,092
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm not dropping the chicken.</font>

822
01:04:23,093 --> 01:04:25,294
<font color=#FCFCFC>You could maybe do
it somewhere else.</font>

823
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:26,462
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What are you talk...
- Find a new spot.</font>

824
01:04:26,463 --> 01:04:28,197
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's gotta be the Van Beek.</font>

825
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,465
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, it doesn't have
to be the Van Beek.</font>

826
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:31,834
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can't let them samba
all over its history.</font>

827
01:04:31,835 --> 01:04:34,237
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can't do it.</font>

828
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,372
<font color=#FCFCFC>You can let them,
but you refuse to.</font>

829
01:04:36,373 --> 01:04:37,407
<font color=#FCFCFC>Your play's incredible.</font>

830
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:41,778
<font color=#FCFCFC>You know, the whole world
from your bedroom.</font>

831
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,815
<font color=#FCFCFC>What else do they want?
Who's doing that?</font>

832
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,818
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that.</font>

833
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,821
<font color=#FCFCFC>Who was that guy
at The Lighthouse?</font>

834
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:54,690
<font color=#FCFCFC>The guy that offered
you the gig?</font>

835
01:04:54,691 --> 01:04:55,924
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Keith.
- Yeah.</font>

836
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:57,560
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why was it so weird
between you two?</font>

837
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:59,895
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's always weird with him.</font>

838
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,630
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Really?
- Yeah.</font>

839
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:02,365
<font color=#FCFCFC>But he seemed kinda nice</font>

840
01:05:02,366 --> 01:05:04,168
<font color=#FCFCFC>'cause he did offer you a job.</font>

841
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:06,702
<font color=#FCFCFC>Are you gonna call him?</font>

842
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:09,805
<font color=#FCFCFC>No. No.</font>

843
01:05:09,806 --> 01:05:10,806
<font color=#FCFCFC>All right.</font>

844
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:15,378
<font color=#FCFCFC>So... here's what we know.</font>

845
01:05:15,379 --> 01:05:17,180
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah?</font>

846
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:19,115
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's definitely
"Chicken On A Stick,"</font>

847
01:05:20,850 --> 01:05:22,250
<font color=#FCFCFC>and your play is
gonna be a triumph.</font>

848
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:28,224
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's a one-woman show,
so it's just me...</font>

849
01:05:28,225 --> 01:05:30,327
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, I mean, I'm
acting in it, too.</font>

850
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:34,263
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, Mom. I'm not getting paid.</font>

851
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,032
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm paying to do it.</font>

852
01:05:38,335 --> 01:05:40,869
<font color=#FCFCFC>He's great. He's gonna
open his own jazz club.</font>

853
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,271
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.</font>

854
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:46,775
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, he hasn't, he
hasn't opened it yet.</font>

855
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,776
<font color=#FCFCFC>He needs some...</font>

856
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:53,850
<font color=#FCFCFC>He's saving up, I think.</font>

857
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,258
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, he doesn't
have a steady gig.</font>

858
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:03,392
<font color=#FCFCFC>But he's figuring it out.</font>

859
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:04,961
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's just been a
little tricky lately.</font>

860
01:06:09,366 --> 01:06:11,267
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mom, he's gonna find
a way to open it</font>

861

01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:06,608
<font color=#FCFCFC>Really exciting, I wish I could.</font>

1005
01:19:06,609 --> 01:19:08,276
<font color=#FCFCFC>What are you doing
after the tour?</font>

1006
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:10,712
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why can't you?</font>

1007
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:12,147
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Come to Boise?
- Yeah.</font>

1008
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:13,481
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause I have to rehearse.</font>

1009
01:19:13,482 --> 01:19:15,184
<font color=#FCFCFC>But can't you rehearse anywhere?</font>

1010
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:20,356
<font color=#FCFCFC>Anywhere you are?</font>

1011
01:19:21,524 --> 01:19:23,126
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean, I guess.</font>

1012
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:26,128
<font color=#FCFCFC>Um...</font>

1013
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:28,130
<font color=#FCFCFC>All my stuff is here,
and it's in two weeks,</font>

1014
01:19:28,131 --> 01:19:30,298
<font color=#FCFCFC>so I don't really think
that would be...</font>

1015
01:19:30,633 --> 01:19:32,167
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

1016
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:35,170
<font color=#FCFCFC>- The best idea right now, but...
- Well...</font>

1017
01:19:35,438 --> 01:19:37,639
<font color=#FCFCFC>I wish I could.</font>

1018
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:39,607
<font color=#FCFCFC>We're just gonna have to
try and see each other.</font>

1019
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,076
<font color=#FCFCFC>We never see each other.</font>

1020
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:42,710
<font color=#FCFCFC>I know, but when are you done?</font>

1021
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:44,810
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean? I mean...</font>

1022
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,283
<font color=#FCFCFC>When are you finished
with the whole tour?</font>

1023
01:19:48,651 --> 01:19:50,185
<font color=#FCFCFC>After we finish, we're
gonna go and record,</font>

1024
01:19:50,186 --> 01:19:51,954
<font color=#FCFCFC>and then we go back on tour.</font>

1025
01:19:52,588 --> 01:19:54,156
<font color=#FCFCFC>We tour so we can
make the record,</font>

1026
01:19:54,157 --> 01:19:55,991
<font color=#FCFCFC>so we can go back and
tour the record.</font>

1027
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:01,597
<font color=#FCFCFC>So it's like the long haul?</font>

1028
01:20:05,534 --> 01:20:07,469
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean,
"the long haul"?</font>

1029
01:20:07,470 --> 01:20:08,636
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean the long haul.</font>

1030
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:11,707
<font color=#FCFCFC>Like you're gonna stay in
this band for a long time.</font>

1031
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:14,210
<font color=#FCFCFC>On tour.</font>

1032
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:18,246
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean, what did you
think I was gonna do?</font>

1033
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:20,748
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't... I hadn't really
thought it through.</font>

1034
01:20:20,749 --> 01:20:22,317
<font color=#FCFCFC>I didn't know that the band...</font>

1035
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:24,687
<font color=#FCFCFC>Was so important.</font>

1036
01:20:24,688 --> 01:20:27,089
<font color=#FCFCFC>You didn't think it
would be successful?</font>

1037
01:20:27,090 --> 01:20:28,257
<font color=#FCFCFC>Um...</font>

1038
01:20:30,126 --> 01:20:31,393
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, that's not
really what I mean.</font>

1039
01:20:31,394 --> 01:20:32,794
<font color=#FCFCFC>I just mean that you...</font>

1040
01:20:32,795 --> 01:20:36,631
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean you're gonna be on tour
for, what, months now? Years?</font>

1041
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,100
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah. I don't believe...
This is it.</font>

1042
01:20:38,101 --> 01:20:40,835
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean, this is... it
could easily be ever...</font>

1043
01:20:40,836 --> 01:20:43,371
<font color=#FCFCFC>I could be on tour with this for
a couple of years, at least.</font>

1044
01:20:43,372 --> 01:20:44,372
<font color=#FCFCFC>Just this record.</font>

1045
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:47,876
<font color=#FCFCFC>Do you like the music
you're playing?</font>

1046
01:20:49,845 --> 01:20:52,147
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't...</font>

1047
01:20:52,148 --> 01:20:55,783
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't know what it matters.</font>

1048
01:20:55,784 --> 01:20:57,185
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, it matters,</font>

1049
01:20:57,186 --> 01:20:59,121
<font color=#FCFCFC>because if you're gonna
give up your dream...</font>

1050
01:20:59,122 --> 01:21:01,223
<font color=#FCFCFC>I think it matters
that you like...</font>

1051
01:21:01,224 --> 01:21:03,792
<font color=#FCFCFC>What you're playing on
the road for years.</font>

1052
01:21:06,629 --> 01:21:08,062
<font color=#FCFCFC>Do you like the
music I'm playing?</font>

1053
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,164
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah.</font>

1054
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,134
<font color=#FCFCFC>I do.</font>

1055
01:21:12,135 --> 01:21:13,869
<font color=#FCFCFC>I just didn't think
that you did.</font>

1056
01:21:14,437 --> 01:21:15,570
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, well...</font>

1057
01:21:15,571 --> 01:21:17,205
<font color=#FCFCFC>You always said
Keith is the worst,</font>

1058
01:21:17,206 --> 01:21:18,806
<font color=#FCFCFC>and now you're gonna be on
tour with him for years,</font>

1059
01:21:18,807 --> 01:21:20,442
<font color=#FCFCFC>so I just didn't...</font>

1060
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:21,776
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What are you doing right now?
- Know if you were happy.</font>

1061
01:21:21,777 --> 01:21:23,178
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...</font>

1062
01:21:23,179 --> 01:21:24,107
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean, why
am I doing this?</font>

1063
01:21:24,177 --> 01:21:25,180
<font color=#FCFCFC>I thought you wanted
me to do this.</font>

1064
01:21:25,181 --> 01:21:27,249
<font color=#FCFCFC>It just sounds like now you
don't want me to do it.</font>

1065
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:29,584
<font color=#FCFCFC>What do you mean, I
wanted you to do this?</font>

1066
01:21:29,585 --> 01:21:31,286
<font color=#FCFCFC>This is what you wanted for me.</font>

1067
01:21:31,587 --> 01:21:32,720
<font color=#FCFCFC>To be in this band?</font>

1068
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:33,888
<font color=#FCFCFC>To be in a band.</font>

1069
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,590
<font color=#FCFCFC>To have a steady job, you know?</font>

1070
01:21:35,591 --> 01:21:38,426
<font color=#FCFCFC>To be... you know.</font>

1071
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,163
<font color=#FCFCFC>Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,</font>

1072
01:21:41,164 --> 01:21:42,364
<font color=#FCFCFC>so that you could take care</font>

1073
01:21:42,365 --> 01:21:44,532
<font color=#FCFCFC>of yourself and your life and
you could start your club.</font>

1074
01:21:44,533 --> 01:21:45,733
<font color=#FCFCFC>So I'm doing that. So
I don't understand.</font>

1075
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:46,868
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why aren't we celebrating?</font>

1076
01:21:46,869 --> 01:21:49,237
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why aren't you
starting your club?</font>

1077
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,673
<font color=#FCFCFC>You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.</font>

1078
01:21:51,674 --> 01:21:53,575
<font color=#FCFCFC>No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken On A Stick."</font>

1079
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:54,876
<font color=#FCFCFC>So change the name!</font>

1080
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:57,179
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, no one likes jazz!
Not even you!</font>

1081
01:21:57,180 --> 01:21:59,247
<font color=#FCFCFC>I do like jazz now
because of you!</font>

1082
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:01,316
<font color=#FCFCFC>And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!</font>

1083
01:22:01,550 --> 01:22:02,617
<font color=#FCFCFC>What am I supposed to do?</font>

1084
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,919
<font color=#FCFCFC>Go back to playing Jingle Bells?</font>

1085
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,753
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm not saying that.</font>

1086
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,688
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm saying why don't you...</font>

1087
01:22:06,689 --> 01:22:07,421
<font color=#FCFCFC>take what you've made...</font>

1088
01:22:07,491 --> 01:22:08,656
<font color=#FCFCFC>Scraping pennies so
I can start a club,</font>

1089
01:22:08,657 --> 01:22:09,891
<font color=#FCFCFC>- and start the club?
- No one wants to go to?</font>

1090
01:22:09,892 --> 01:22:11,259
<font color=#FCFCFC>People will want to go to it</font>

1091
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,960
<font color=#FCFCFC>because you're
passionate about it,</font>

1092
01:22:12,961 --> 01:22:15,397
<font color=#FCFCFC>and people love what other
people are passionate about.</font>

1093
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:16,998
<font color=#FCFCFC>You remind people of
what they forgot.</font>

1094
01:22:16,999 --> 01:22:18,066
<font color=#FCFCFC>Not in my experience.</font>

1095
01:22:21,204 --> 01:22:22,970
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, whatever, all right?
I mean it is...</font>

1096
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,207
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's just time to
grow up, you know?</font>

1097
01:22:25,208 --> 01:22:27,342
<font color=#FCFCFC>I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing.</font>

1098
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:28,943
<font color=#FCFCFC>And now all of a sudden if
you had these problems,</font>

1099
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,845
<font color=#FCFCFC>I wish you would have
said them earlier,</font>

1100
01:22:30,846 --> 01:22:32,447
<font color=#FCFCFC>before I signed on the
goddamn dotted line!</font>

1101
01:22:32,448 --> 01:22:34,349
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm pointing out
that you had a dream</font>

1102
01:22:34,350 --> 01:22:36,218
<font color=#FCFCFC>that you followed, that
you were sticking to...</font>

1103
01:22:36,219 --> 01:22:37,885
<font color=#FCFCFC>This is the dream!
This is the dream.</font>

1104
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:39,787
<font color=#FCFCFC>- This is not your dream!
- Guys like me</font>

1105
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:41,889
<font color=#FCFCFC>work their whole lives
to be in something</font>

1106
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,658
<font color=#FCFCFC>that's successful,
that people like.</font>

1107
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:44,892
<font color=#FCFCFC>You know?</font>

1108
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:46,661
<font color=#FCFCFC>I mean, I'm finally
in something...</font>

1109
01:22:46,662 --> 01:22:48,896
<font color=#FCFCFC>that people enjoy.</font>

1110
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,398
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Since when do you care...
- Just 'cause I don't...</font>

1111
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:51,866
<font color=#FCFCFC>- about being liked?
- Enjoy it, it doesn't matter.</font>

1112
01:22:51,867 --> 01:22:53,935
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why do you care so much
about being liked?</font>

1113
01:22:53,936 --> 01:22:55,736
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're an actress! What
are you talking about?</font>

1114
01:23:14,257 --> 01:23:15,923
<font color=#FCFCFC>Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass,</font>

1115
01:23:15,924 --> 01:23:18,361
<font color=#FCFCFC>'cause it made you feel
better about yourself.</font>

1116
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,532
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Are you kidding?
- No.</font>

1117
01:23:45,821 --> 01:23:46,822
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't know.</font>

1118
01:25:07,636 --> 01:25:09,937
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, fellas. I'll
see ya tomorrow.</font>

1119
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,373
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Sebastian?
- Yeah?</font>

1120
01:25:11,374 --> 01:25:12,840
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're good for tonight, right?</font>

1121
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:15,677
<font color=#FCFCFC>What are you talking about?</font>

1122
01:25:15,678 --> 01:25:16,679
<font color=#FCFCFC>7:00, the photo shoot.</font>

1123
01:25:18,381 --> 01:25:20,048
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mojo. Are you good?</font>

1124
01:25:23,386 --> 01:25:25,052
<font color=#FCFCFC>I thought that was
next Thursday.</font>

1125
01:25:25,053 --> 01:25:26,053
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, it's tonight.</font>

1126
01:25:29,057 --> 01:25:30,057
<font color=#FCFCFC>Is that okay?</font>

1127
01:26:26,916 --> 01:26:29,150
<font color=#FCFCFC>- David, give me the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?</font>

1128
01:26:29,151 --> 01:26:30,284
<font color=#FCFCFC>"What's wrong with that one?"</font>

1129
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:32,654
<font color=#FCFCFC>It doesn't bloody work,
that's what's wrong with it!</font>

1130
01:26:32,655 --> 01:26:33,989
<font color=#FCFCFC>All right, trumpet,
that's lovely.</font>

1131
01:26:35,824 --> 01:26:37,493
<font color=#FCFCFC>Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!</font>

1132
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,696
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, keyboard. Okay, look up.</font>

1133
01:26:41,697 --> 01:26:44,499
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's good. That's good,
that's lovely. Lovely.</font>

1134
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,600
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, cut the music!</font>

1135
01:26:45,601 --> 01:26:48,636
<font color=#FCFCFC>That is lovely. That's lovely.</font>

1136
01:26:48,637 --> 01:26:52,574
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, now bite your lip
like this, sort of like...</font>

1137
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:54,676
<font color=#FCFCFC>Like you're concentrating
on something, I don't know,</font>

1138
01:26:54,677 --> 01:26:56,043
<font color=#FCFCFC>like a piece of your music.</font>

1139
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,479
<font color=#FCFCFC>Bite my what?</font>

1140
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,214
<font color=#FCFCFC>Your lip. Bite your
lip, you know...</font>

1141
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:01,549
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

1142
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:03,084
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, that's good. That's great.</font>

1143
01:27:03,085 --> 01:27:04,552
<font color=#FCFCFC>Beautiful! Beautiful.</font>

1144
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:06,554
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, now just move your glasses</font>

1145
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,623
<font color=#FCFCFC>down on... onto the nose...</font>

1146
01:27:08,624 --> 01:27:09,491
<font color=#FCFCFC>A little bit further,</font>

1147
01:27:09,492 --> 01:27:10,758
<font color=#FCFCFC>just a little bit,
a touch further.</font>

1148
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:12,827
<font color=#FCFCFC>Keep your head down,
but look up at me.</font>

1149
01:27:12,828 --> 01:27:14,629
<font color=#FCFCFC>Look sort of moody.</font>

1150
01:27:14,630 --> 01:27:17,231
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah! That's beautiful!
That is great!</font>

1151
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,834
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, turn the keyboard on live!</font>

1152
01:27:20,669 --> 01:27:21,836
<font color=#FCFCFC>Do you wanna hear
the keyboard then?</font>

1153
01:27:21,837 --> 01:27:23,237
<font color=#FCFCFC>You don't have to
bite your lip now.</font>

1154
01:27:24,540 --> 01:27:26,074
<font color=#FCFCFC>Well, actually play something.</font>

1155
01:27:27,275 --> 01:27:29,644
<font color=#FCFCFC>Play something. You know?
Anything.</font>

1156
01:27:29,645 --> 01:27:31,479
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're a pianist, aren't you?
Play something.</font>

1157
01:27:44,627 --> 01:27:46,561
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's great, that's beautiful.</font>

1158
01:27:46,562 --> 01:27:48,162
<font color=#FCFCFC>That's lovely. Oh, that's good.</font>

1159
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:50,632
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, don't stop. Keep playing.</font>

1160
01:27:50,633 --> 01:27:52,568
<font color=#FCFCFC>Go on, just keep playing.
That was great!</font>

1161
01:28:32,741 --> 01:28:34,141
<font color=#FCFCFC>Shoot myself in the head.</font>

1162
01:28:36,178 --> 01:28:37,912
<font color=#FCFCFC>She's not even good.</font>

1163
01:28:37,913 --> 01:28:39,781
<font color=#FCFCFC>That whole window thing...</font>

1164
01:28:39,782 --> 01:28:42,183
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, what was that
shit with the window?</font>

1165
01:28:42,184 --> 01:28:44,786
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, my God! Don't
quit your day job.</font>

1166
01:28:44,787 --> 01:28:45,787
<font color=#FCFCFC>Oh, well...</font>

1167
01:28:46,722 --> 01:28:49,191
<font color=#FCFCFC>Not good. One-woman shows
are always terrible.</font>

1168
01:29:12,815 --> 01:29:13,815
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mia!</font>

1169
01:29:16,018 --> 01:29:18,920
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mia. I'm so sorry.</font>

1170
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:23,758
<font color=#FCFCFC>Just tell me how it went.
How was it?</font>

1171
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:25,160
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Don't help me.
- I'm sorry.</font>

1172
01:29:26,294 --> 01:29:27,629
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm sorry I've
been such a prick.</font>

1173
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:30,264
<font color=#FCFCFC>- You're sorry, you're sorry...
- I sorry for being a curt.</font>

1174
01:29:30,265 --> 01:29:31,633
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're sorry.</font>

1175
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:33,101
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm gonna make it up to you.</font>

1176
01:29:33,936 --> 01:29:35,303
<font color=#FCFCFC>Let me make it up to you, okay?</font>

1177
01:29:41,677 --> 01:29:43,077
<font color=#FCFCFC>I don't blame you
for not wanting...</font>

1178
01:29:43,122 --> 01:29:44,122
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's over.</font>

1179
01:29:45,180 --> 01:29:47,014
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What is?
- It's over.</font>

1180
01:29:47,015 --> 01:29:48,015
<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

1181
01:29:50,185 --> 01:29:52,019
<font color=#FCFCFC>All of this.</font>

1182
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,323
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done. I'm done.</font>

1183
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:58,392
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Nobody showed up.
- So what? So what?</font>

1184
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,663
<font color=#FCFCFC>I can't pay back the theater.
This is so...</font>

1185
01:30:02,130 --> 01:30:03,998
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm gonna go home for a while.</font>

1186
01:30:03,999 --> 01:30:05,667
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'll come see you tomorrow.</font>

1187
01:30:05,668 --> 01:30:06,708
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, I'm going "home" home.</font>

1188
01:30:07,803 --> 01:30:09,003
<font color=#FCFCFC>This is home.</font>

1189
01:30:09,004 --> 01:30:10,238
<font color=#FCFCFC>No, it's not anymore.</font>

1190
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,074
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yep?</font>

1191
01:32:27,075 --> 01:32:30,077
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hi, I'm trying to
reach Mia Dolan?</font>

1192
01:32:30,078 --> 01:32:31,879
<font color=#FCFCFC>Wrong number.</font>

1193
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,080
<font color=#FCFCFC>She's not answering her cell.</font>

1194
01:32:33,081 --> 01:32:34,081
<font color=#FCFCFC>I was told I might
find her here.</font>

1195
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:35,282
<font color=#FCFCFC>Not anymore.</font>

1196
01:32:35,283 --> 01:32:36,350
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay, well...</font>

1197
01:32:36,351 --> 01:32:37,791
<font color=#FCFCFC>- If you do talk to her...
- I won't.</font>

1198
01:32:37,820 --> 01:32:39,186
<font color=#FCFCFC>Could you tell her Jane
at Amy Brandt Casting</font>

1199
01:32:39,187 --> 01:32:40,187
<font color=#FCFCFC>is trying to reach her?</font>

1200
01:32:46,829 --> 01:32:47,829
<font color=#FCFCFC>Casting?</font>

1201
01:32:56,471 --> 01:32:57,472
<font color=#FCFCFC>Who the hell is that?</font>

1202
01:33:03,545 --> 01:33:04,846
<font color=#FCFCFC>Shut that thing off!</font>

1203
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:16,924
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why did you come here?</font>

1204
01:33:16,925 --> 01:33:18,860
<font color=#FCFCFC>Because I have good news.</font>

1205
01:33:18,861 --> 01:33:20,261
<font color=#FCFCFC>What?</font>

1206
01:33:20,262 --> 01:33:22,697
<font color=#FCFCFC>Amy Brandt, the
Casting Director...</font>

1207
01:33:22,965 --> 01:33:25,066
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yeah.
- She was at your play,</font>

1208
01:33:25,067 --> 01:33:26,934
<font color=#FCFCFC>and she loved it.</font>

1209
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:29,303
<font color=#FCFCFC>And she loved it so much</font>

1210
01:33:29,304 --> 01:33:30,337
<font color=#FCFCFC>that she wants you
to come in tomorrow</font>

1211
01:33:30,338 --> 01:33:33,040
<font color=#FCFCFC>and audition for this huge
movie that she's got.</font>

1212
01:33:35,210 --> 01:33:36,411
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm not going to that.</font>

1213
01:33:38,947 --> 01:33:40,247
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I'm not going to that.
- What?</font>

1214
01:33:40,248 --> 01:33:42,950
<font color=#FCFCFC>That one's gonna be... No.
That one's gonna be...</font>

1215
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:44,185
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm sorry?</font>

1216
01:33:44,186 --> 01:33:45,553
<font color=#FCFCFC>That will kill me.</font>

1217
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:49,123
<font color=#FCFCFC>- What?
- What?</font>

1218
01:33:49,124 --> 01:33:51,058
<font color=#FCFCFC>What? Shh! Stop!</font>

1219
01:33:51,059 --> 01:33:52,659
<font color=#FCFCFC>No!</font>

1220
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,395
<font color=#FCFCFC>You have to be quiet.</font>

1221
01:33:53,396 --> 01:33:54,595
<font color=#FCFCFC>- If you want...
- We're in a neighborhood.</font>

1222
01:33:54,596 --> 01:33:55,930
<font color=#FCFCFC>Then you have to make sense,
if you want me to be quiet,</font>

1223
01:33:55,931 --> 01:33:57,164
<font color=#FCFCFC>you have to make
some goddamn sense!</font>

1224
01:33:57,165 --> 01:33:58,365
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Tell me why you're not going.
- They'll call the police.</font>

1225
01:33:58,366 --> 01:33:59,566
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Because...
- Why?</font>

1226
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:00,434
<font color=#FCFCFC>I've been to a
million auditions,</font>

1227
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:02,203
<font color=#FCFCFC>and the same thing
happens every time</font>

1228
01:34:02,204 --> 01:34:03,137
<font color=#FCFCFC>where I get interrupted</font>

1229
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,139
<font color=#FCFCFC>because someone wants
to get a sandwich!</font>

1230
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:08,009
<font color=#FCFCFC>Or I'm crying, and
they start laughing!</font>

1231
01:34:08,010 --> 01:34:10,144
<font color=#FCFCFC>Or there's people sitting
in the waiting room,</font>

1232
01:34:10,145 --> 01:34:14,181
<font color=#FCFCFC>and they're like me but
prettier and better at the...</font>

1233
01:34:14,182 --> 01:34:15,983
<font color=#FCFCFC>Because maybe I'm
not good enough!</font>

1234
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:18,452
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Yes, you are.
- No...</font>

1235
01:34:18,453 --> 01:34:20,021
<font color=#FCFCFC>- No, maybe I'm not.
- Yes, you are.</font>

1236
01:34:20,022 --> 01:34:23,024
<font color=#FCFCFC>- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.</font>

1237
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:26,961
<font color=#FCFCFC>Maybe I'm one of
those people that</font>

1238
01:34:26,962 --> 01:34:29,130
<font color=#FCFCFC>has always wanted to do it,</font>

1239
01:34:29,131 --> 01:34:32,266
<font color=#FCFCFC>but it's like a pipe dream for me.
You know?</font>

1240
01:34:32,267 --> 01:34:34,035
<font color=#FCFCFC>And then, you said it,</font>

1241
01:34:34,036 --> 01:34:37,038
<font color=#FCFCFC>you change your dreams,
and then you grow up.</font>

1242
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:38,973
<font color=#FCFCFC>Maybe I'm one of those people,
and I'm not supposed to.</font>

1243
01:34:38,974 --> 01:34:41,308
<font color=#FCFCFC>And I can go back to school,</font>

1244
01:34:41,309 --> 01:34:43,344
<font color=#FCFCFC>and I can find something
else I'm supposed to do.</font>

1245
01:34:43,345 --> 01:34:46,313
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause I left to do that,</font>

1246
01:34:46,314 --> 01:34:47,481
<font color=#FCFCFC>and it's been six years,</font>

1247
01:34:47,482 --> 01:34:49,084
<font color=#FCFCFC>and I don't want
to do it anymore.</font>

1248
01:34:52,487 --> 01:34:53,488
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why?</font>

1249
01:34:56,224 --> 01:34:57,091
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why what?</font>

1250
01:34:57,092 --> 01:34:58,893
<font color=#FCFCFC>Why don't you want
to do it anymore?</font>

1251
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:03,129
<font color=#FCFCFC>'Cause I think it hurts
a little bit too much.</font>

1252
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,268
<font color=#FCFCFC>You're a baby.</font>

1253
01:35:08,703 --> 01:35:10,006
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'm not a baby. I'm
trying to grow up.</font>

1254
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:10,471
<font color=#FCFCFC>You are.</font>

1255
01:35:10,472 --> 01:35:12,173
<font color=#FCFCFC>- You're crying like a baby.
- Oh, my God.</font>

1256
01:35:12,174 --> 01:35:14,009
<font color=#FCFCFC>You have an audition
tomorrow at 5:30.</font>

1257
01:35:15,077 --> 01:35:16,911
<font color=#FCFCFC>I'll be out front at 8:00 a.m.</font>

1258
01:35:18,113 --> 01:35:20,281
<font color=#FCFCFC>You'll be out front
or not, I don't know.</font>

1259
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:22,951
<font color=#FCFCFC>How'd you find me here?</font>

1260
01:35:24,987 --> 01:35:26,307
<font color=#FCFCFC>The house in front
of the library.</font>

1261
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:11,333
<font color=#FCFCFC>- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.</font>

1262
01:36:29,617 --> 01:36:30,685
<font color=#FCFCFC>Mia?</font>

1263
01:36:37,259 --> 01:36:39,426
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hi, Mia. I'm Amy
and this is Frank.</font>

1264
01:36:39,427 --> 01:36:41,095
<font color=#FCFCFC>Hi. How are ya?</font>

1265
01:36:41,096 --> 01:36:43,230
<font color=#FCFCFC>Nice to meet you.
Glad we found you.</font>

1266
01:36:43,231 --> 01:36:44,231
<font color=#FCFCFC>Me, too.</font>

1267
01:36:46,068 --> 01:36:48,736
<font color=#FCFCFC>The film shoots in Paris,
and we don't have a script.</font>

1268
01:36:51,106 --> 01:36:53,074
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's gonna be a process.</font>

1269
01:36:53,075 --> 01:36:55,142
<font color=#FCFCFC>We're gonna build the
character around the actress.</font>

1270
01:36:55,143 --> 01:36:57,245
<font color=#FCFCFC>It's a 3-month rehearsal
and a 4-month shoot.</font>

1271
01:36:59,347 --> 01:37:01,448
<font color=#FCFCFC>Okay.</font>

1272
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:04,651
<font color=#FCFCFC>And we thought that you
could just tell us a story.</font>

1273
01:37:04,652 --> 01:37:06,353
<font color=#FCFCFC>About?</font>

1274
01:37:06,354 --> 01:37:08,655
<font color=#FCFCFC>You can just tell us anything.</font>

1275
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,224
<font color=#FCFCFC>Anything?</font>

1276
01:37:10,225 --> 01:37:12,626
<font color=#FCFCFC>Yeah, just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.</font>

1277
01:37:12,627 --> 01:37:14,696
<font color=#FCFCFC>Um...</font>

1278
01:37:18,233 --> 01:37:19,233
<font color=#FCFCFC>Whenever you're ready.</font>

1279
01:37:29,877 --> 01:37:31,413
<font color=#FCFCFC>My aunt used to live in Paris.</font>

1280
01:37:37,419 --> 01:37:39,539
<font color=#FCFCFC>I remember she used to come
home and she would tell us</font>

1281
01:37:40,355 --> 01:37:43,958
<font color=#FCFCFC>these stories about
being abroad, and...</font>

1282
01:37:46,128 --> 01:37:47,128
<font color=#FCFCFC>I remember,</font>

1283
01:37:48,596 --> 01:37:50,998
<font color=#FCFCFC>she told us that she jumped
into the river... once.</font>

1284
01:37:53,735 --> 01:37:54,735
<font color=#FF00FF>♪ Barefoot ♪</font>

1285
