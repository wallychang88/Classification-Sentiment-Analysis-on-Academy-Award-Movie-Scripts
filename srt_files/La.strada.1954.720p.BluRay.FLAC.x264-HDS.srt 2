1
00:02:15,252 --> 00:02:21,133
You must go home! Mama said that
you should come home immediately!

2
00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:25,637
There is a man, with a big, big motorcycle!

3
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:29,141
He said Rosa is dead.

4
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:45,282
Gelsomina! You know Zampano,
Rosa's husband?

5
00:02:45,908 --> 00:02:50,412
My poor daughter! She died far from
home. I'll never see her grave!

6
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:56,919
She is dead, the poor thing!
She was so beautiful, worked so hard!

7
00:02:57,127 --> 00:02:59,880
She could do everything!

8
00:03:01,006 --> 00:03:04,676
Look at her, Zampano, she looks like Rosa.

9
00:03:04,885 --> 00:03:09,890
This is Gelsomina.
How miserable we are!

10
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,434
Of course, Zampano,

11
00:03:12,684 --> 00:03:19,191
she isn't Rosa, but she's of
good nature and disciplined,

12
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:21,819
just a little bit strange,

13
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:25,697
but if she gets food every
day, she'll get better.

14
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:30,327
Do you want to go with Zampano
and take Rosa's place?

15
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:34,206
You can learn something, earn money,

16
00:03:34,706 --> 00:03:38,085
and we'd have one hungry soul less to feed.

17
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:43,090
Zampano is a kind man, he'll be good to you.

18
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:47,219
You will see the world,
learn to sing and dance,

19
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:52,224
and look what he did:
He gave me 10.000 Lire!

20
00:03:52,433 --> 00:03:59,982
We could repair the roof and
buy some food again...

21
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:05,237
Why did your father have to
leave us so early...

22
00:04:05,863 --> 00:04:10,242
You've already grown but never worked.

23
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:15,372
It's not your fault, that you're
not like the other girls.

24
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:21,962
Don't you want to help your mother?
Zampano, will she learn something?

25
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:26,341
Sure, I can teach things even to a dog!

26
00:04:28,218 --> 00:04:30,095
All right,

27
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:35,225
buy salami, 1/2 cheese

28
00:04:36,101 --> 00:04:38,353
and two bottles of wine.

29
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:43,859
- That's how I am.
- Thank him, children.

30
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:49,239
Where are you going?
Come here!

31
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,493
What are you doing?

32
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,382
- You'll go away, Gelsomina?
- I'll work, learn something

33
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:10,886
and send some money home.
I'll become an artist,

34
00:05:11,136 --> 00:05:13,597
will dance and sing like Rosa...

35
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:18,018
- And, when you'll return?
- When she'll return?

36
00:05:18,268 --> 00:05:20,395
Don't go away!

37
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:24,024
My dear child! Stay with me!

38
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:32,533
We'll be back soon!

39
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,622
Departure!

40
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:43,126
Your things, Gelsomina!
Your scarf!

41
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,255
Get in!

42
00:05:50,175 --> 00:05:52,052
My daughter!

43
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:55,556
My poor daughter!

44
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:27,462
This chain is 0.5 cm thick,

45
00:06:27,713 --> 00:06:30,591
pure iron, stronger then steel!

46
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:34,094
With a simple expansion of
the chest muscles...

47
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:37,347
I'll blow up the hook!

48
00:06:37,723 --> 00:06:40,475
Thanks.

49
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:46,356
For that I have to blow up
my lungs like a hose!

50
00:06:46,565 --> 00:06:50,235
There is a danger that a vein
bursts and I spit blood!

51
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,487
Once in Milan,

52
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:58,076
a 70 kg man lost his eyesight,
when he tried it.

53
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:01,747
The eyeballs have to stand the pressure!

54
00:07:01,997 --> 00:07:05,626
And when the eyesight is
lost, then it's over!

55
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:10,088
Those, who have weak nerves,
should better look away.

56
00:07:11,006 --> 00:07:13,342
It could bleed!

57
00:08:15,404 --> 00:08:19,032
You never used to cook at home, didn't you?

58
00:08:19,324 --> 00:08:21,284
What a rank shit!

59
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,793
Here are enough clothes for ten
people. Shoes, dresses, anything.

60
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,130
Come here, maybe some of
them will suit you right.

61
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,343
You have to look exquisite. You don't
travel with Zampano in rags.

62
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:41,388
My ladies always looked tasteful!

63
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:52,357
Now say: "Here comes Zampano!"

64
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:54,526
Here comes Zampano.

65
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,792
Here comes Zampano.

66
00:09:11,001 --> 00:09:12,919
Here comes Zampano.

67
00:09:22,137 --> 00:09:24,055
Come here!

68
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:37,819
That's a trumpet.

69
00:09:58,715 --> 00:10:00,967
You do only, what I tell you.

70
00:10:07,349 --> 00:10:11,102
This is a tambour.

71
00:10:20,737 --> 00:10:23,114
Here comes Zampano!

72
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:27,494
Here comes Zampano.

73
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:40,507
Here comes Zampano!

74
00:10:44,761 --> 00:10:46,346
Zampano is here.

75
00:11:11,037 --> 00:11:12,539
Once again!

76
00:11:13,415 --> 00:11:15,750
Here comes Zampano.

77
00:11:17,752 --> 00:11:19,254
Come here.

78
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,427
Here.

79
00:11:27,137 --> 00:11:28,513
Again!

80
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,311
Zampano is here!

81
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:38,023
That's how you have to say it:

82
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:41,151
Here comes Zampano!

83
00:11:42,777 --> 00:11:43,945
Come on!

84
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,449
Here comes Zampano...

85
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:04,215
Fire which burns, sparks in heaven,
night without an end... Booh, booh...

86
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:08,094
What are you doing?

87
00:12:12,057 --> 00:12:14,184
It'll rain in two days.

88
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,938
- How do you know?
- It'll rain!

89
00:12:20,231 --> 00:12:21,483
Come here.

90
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,375
Get in.

91
00:12:51,012 --> 00:12:54,265
- I'll sleep outside.
- Oh really?

92
00:12:58,144 --> 00:12:59,980
Now listen:

93
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:07,612
- What's your name?
- Di Costanzo Gelsomina.

94
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,865
Come on, Gelsomina, move.

95
00:13:22,544 --> 00:13:25,755
- Tomorrow.
- Come on, get in!

96
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:16,056
Thank You.

97
00:14:16,806 --> 00:14:20,852
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time in this city,

98
00:14:21,102 --> 00:14:24,606
a new posse, about which you
can laugh from the heart!

99
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:26,983
Enjoy it!

100
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:33,073
Those, who have a weak
heart shouldn't watch,

101
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:35,241
they could die from laughter!

102
00:14:35,492 --> 00:14:38,828
And because not even the greatest
artist can live with air only,

103
00:14:38,995 --> 00:14:41,998
my wife will reach the
hat around afterwards.

104
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:44,209
Go, go!

105
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,262
Quickly!

106
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:08,983
Good day, Signorina Gelsomina!

107
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,152
Zampano!

108
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:16,616
Pardon my question, aren't you
afraid of my "Rufle"?

109
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:22,622
I said, aren't you afraid of my "Rufle"?!

110
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,628
All right, then we'll go and
hunt some with my "Rufle".

111
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:37,428
Ha-ha-ha, that's not a "Rufle",
that's a "Rifle"! Dummy!

112
00:15:43,393 --> 00:15:47,313
Where are the ducks?

113
00:15:49,941 --> 00:15:56,197
If here are no ducks, you're
the duck and I am the hunter!

114
00:15:58,908 --> 00:16:03,830
No! That's a donkey, not a duck!

115
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:21,431
Thank you!

116
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:24,601
My wife asks you now for a small donation.

117
00:16:24,809 --> 00:16:29,480
Whoever gives something and those, who can't
afford anything, all are appreciated.

118
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:34,110
- Good evening.
- Close the door!

119
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,696
- What's up, fatso?
- Hi, Zampano.

120
00:16:38,114 --> 00:16:41,993
- Hey, Zingaro, you're here too?
- Zampano, how is it goin'?

121
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:43,995
That's my wife.

122
00:16:44,245 --> 00:16:47,999
Wife? A new girlfriend,
I'm glad to hear.

123
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:51,461
- Sit down.
- It's fine, we'll sit there.

124
00:16:56,633 --> 00:16:58,259
Waiter!

125
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,888
- Should I leave?
- No, stay here!

126
00:17:02,096 --> 00:17:05,975
- Waiter!
- I'm coming.

127
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:07,727
Give us some food.

128
00:17:08,728 --> 00:17:11,105
Lamb roast and ragout are
ready to be served.

129
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,816
What would you have?

130
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,863
- This.
- Lamb or ragout?

131
00:17:19,364 --> 00:17:20,949
Both of them.

132
00:17:21,115 --> 00:17:22,951
- Both?
- Yes, both.

133
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:26,746
- Lamb roast with noodles for me.
- All right.

134
00:17:27,372 --> 00:17:29,582
And one litre of red wine.

135
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:20,049
- Where are you from?
- From my home village.

136
00:18:22,885 --> 00:18:28,182
You speak different from the people
here. Where were you born?

137
00:18:30,393 --> 00:18:32,437
In my father's home.

138
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:35,940
Waiter, one more bottle!

139
00:18:40,069 --> 00:18:43,448
That supposed to be wool? It's wadding!
It'll hang between the toes!

140
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:47,660
Hey, redhead! Come here!

141
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:56,085
- You're talking to me?
- Yea, come here!

142
00:18:57,587 --> 00:18:59,172
Good evening.

143
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:01,299
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

144
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:03,468
Sit down there.

145
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:10,808
- You want something to drink?
- Gladly.

146
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,938
- Wine, but fast!
- This restaurant doesn't please me at all.

147
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,858
A cigarette?

148
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:34,499
- I know you from somewhere.
- It's possible, I have been around.

149
00:19:34,874 --> 00:19:36,000
Here, the wine.

150
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,003
- Have you already eaten?
- Yes.

151
00:19:41,964 --> 00:19:43,633
Here to you!

152
00:19:48,513 --> 00:19:52,725
Where have I seen you?
What do you work?

153
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,019
I'm a travelling artist.

154
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:58,147
She's my assistant.
I taught her everything,

155
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:00,858
She couldn't even say
"I-A" on her own!

156
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:08,032
Here, feel it.

157
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,413
What a nasty guy you are!

158
00:20:13,996 --> 00:20:15,623
Here, look at this.

159
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,419
Earned all of it within an hour with those.

160
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:21,671
May I?

161
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,550
She's a real brand!

162
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,886
Let's go outside, it stinks here!

163
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,806
- Let's watch the fireworks.
- Let's go then.

164
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:34,809
Waiter, two more bottles!

165
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:39,522
- What do you get?
- 4.200 with these two.

166
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,082
Still here at this time?

167
00:20:58,791 --> 00:21:01,836
- How's the business?
- It's okay.

168
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:07,091
Put the bottles in the wagon.

169
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,470
Redhead, where do you go?

170
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:14,056
- Get in!
- Ls this your car?

171
00:21:15,725 --> 00:21:18,936
- Are you crazy?
- That's an American,

172
00:21:19,187 --> 00:21:22,440
never failed in seven years!

173
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:27,487
- Oh my God, what are you doing?
- Do you hear, what motor it is?

174
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,740
- Should I enter in the back?
- You wait here.

175
00:21:30,948 --> 00:21:33,075
Where do you go?

176
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:32,677
Still here?

177
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,763
Why you don't eat the soup?

178
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:37,014
Why she doesn't eat?

179
00:22:37,265 --> 00:22:39,433
She doesn't want to, something
is wrong with her.

180
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:42,186
No, I won't eat my soup!

181
00:22:42,436 --> 00:22:45,064
Do you see? Ingratitude
is the world's wage.

182
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:51,070
Is that not your husband
with that strange car?

183
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,197
That's surely him.

184
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:56,826
His vehicle is near the sand pits.

185
00:22:57,034 --> 00:23:00,079
- Where?
- Where the city ends.

186
00:25:25,474 --> 00:25:28,102
You have to climb over.

187
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:13,481
Are you awake?

188
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,650
I sowed some tomatoes.

189
00:26:18,402 --> 00:26:19,987
Tomatoes!

190
00:26:24,867 --> 00:26:30,289
I found some real tomato seeds
and put them into earth.

191
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,292
Get in, let's go!

192
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:44,053
- We move along?
- You want to wait for the tomatoes to grow?!

193
00:26:44,261 --> 00:26:46,013
Go and push.

194
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:06,826
You did it the same way with Rosa?

195
00:27:07,034 --> 00:27:08,410
What?

196
00:27:09,703 --> 00:27:11,664
With Rosa.

197
00:27:12,581 --> 00:27:14,583
What are you talking about?

198
00:27:15,084 --> 00:27:17,461
Why you left with that woman?

199
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:21,715
- You did it the same way with Rosa?
- Stop it!

200
00:27:29,223 --> 00:27:30,474
What do you want?

201
00:27:30,724 --> 00:27:33,811
So you go with other women?

202
00:27:34,103 --> 00:27:35,229
What?

203
00:27:35,479 --> 00:27:37,857
You go with other women?

204
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:41,986
If you want to stay with me, you'll
need to learn one thing before all:

205
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:44,822
To shut your mouth!

206
00:27:47,199 --> 00:27:48,826
Tomatoes!

207
00:27:50,744 --> 00:27:53,873
What thoughts you got in your head?!

208
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,708
Here.

209
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:18,147
Dear guests!

210
00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:28,657
To the wedding couple!

211
00:28:29,033 --> 00:28:31,410
To the wedding couple!

212
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:42,171
The funny Bajazzo.

213
00:29:13,577 --> 00:29:15,704
- Hey, you there!
- She calls us.

214
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:18,791
- You have to eat something too.
- Thank you, we're coming.

215
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:22,419
- Where are you?
- Come and sit with us!

216
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,711
No time.

217
00:29:37,226 --> 00:29:38,852
Come with me!

218
00:29:40,229 --> 00:29:42,982
- I have to eat first.
- Come!

219
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,364
Where are you taking me?

220
00:30:05,254 --> 00:30:08,632
I'll slap you, if you won't let me go.

221
00:30:15,264 --> 00:30:17,141
Oswaldo, look who's here!

222
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:27,901
This is Oswaldo, he's ill
and may not go outside.

223
00:30:28,152 --> 00:30:31,113
No one visits him. Make
him laugh a little.

224
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,280
HOW?

225
00:30:32,364 --> 00:30:35,034
The way you did before, downstairs.

226
00:30:37,494 --> 00:30:39,663
Birdie-bird...

227
00:30:57,431 --> 00:31:02,019
What are you dong here?
I'll teach you manners!

228
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:06,148
And what do you want? Out!

229
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,834
Do you always eat standing, like a horse?

230
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,837
I always eat that way.

231
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:37,596
I saw enough marriages, was married
twice myself, both husbands are dead.

232
00:31:40,974 --> 00:31:44,978
I'm standing in the kitchen since three
o'clock, but I'm not tired yet!

233
00:31:45,229 --> 00:31:50,192
I could dance the whole night long,
the youngsters can't handle it anymore.

234
00:31:51,485 --> 00:31:53,612
Why you won't marry?

235
00:31:53,821 --> 00:31:58,325
One more husband? No, thanks.
I like to decide on my own!

236
00:31:58,992 --> 00:32:03,997
Do you need men only to make...
decisions?

237
00:32:04,748 --> 00:32:09,128
Why? I'm not made of stone,
everybody needs some joy, or not?

238
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,843
What do you want? Get lost!

239
00:32:18,262 --> 00:32:21,265
My first husband was as big
and strong as you are.

240
00:32:21,598 --> 00:32:25,018
I still have his suits, they fit for no one.

241
00:32:30,023 --> 00:32:31,775
There, upstairs...!

242
00:32:33,485 --> 00:32:35,529
I'll bring you some.

243
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:40,159
There is a boy with a inspectrice...

244
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,036
Here, eat some.

245
00:32:43,245 --> 00:32:46,039
Help me to get some wine -
there is not much left.

246
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:50,377
Tell me, all the suits...
are just hanging there?

247
00:32:50,544 --> 00:32:56,008
- There are no big men anymore.
- Ls there a hat too?

248
00:32:56,383 --> 00:33:02,514
- I could use one.
- Yes, come and see for yourself.

249
00:33:27,831 --> 00:33:31,335
Good bye!

250
00:34:13,627 --> 00:34:16,755
Zampano, do you remember,
how beautiful it sounded?

251
00:34:20,884 --> 00:34:23,804
The day when it rained...

252
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:42,281
Teach me to play the trumpet,
I'll learn it fast for sure.

253
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:47,077
You taught it to Rosa too?
She worked the same like me?

254
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:51,081
And, how do I look?

255
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:55,585
Right for the women!

256
00:34:57,587 --> 00:34:59,840
May I smoke in here?

257
00:35:08,056 --> 00:35:10,976
- What's up with you?
- Nothing!

258
00:35:11,184 --> 00:35:14,604
- Why are you blubbering then?
- Because...

259
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:21,194
Come up!

260
00:35:22,863 --> 00:35:24,698
Come on.

261
00:35:26,575 --> 00:35:30,120
- You want to stay there the whole night?
- Yes, the whole night!

262
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:55,771
<i>I go away-</i>

263
00:35:56,271 --> 00:36:00,025
Back to my village. I don't like
it here with you anymore!

264
00:36:07,491 --> 00:36:11,661
It's not because of the work:
I like this work.

265
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,165
I like being an artist!

266
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:19,127
But I don't like you!

267
00:36:19,795 --> 00:36:21,254
What?

268
00:36:23,799 --> 00:36:25,634
I leave!

269
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:31,890
- I go home.
- Stop the bullshit.

270
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:41,066
I let the shoes here. And
this coat I leave too.

271
00:36:41,316 --> 00:36:42,818
I let everything here.

272
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:05,340
Enough! Always the same!

273
00:37:19,354 --> 00:37:21,314
I leave!

274
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:03,787
And now "Il Matto" will show us
his most dangerous attraction!

275
00:41:03,953 --> 00:41:08,958
He'll eat spaghetti standing
in a forty meter height!

276
00:41:09,459 --> 00:41:13,296
We ask for absolute silence,
already the smallest distraction

277
00:41:13,546 --> 00:41:17,092
can let it end deadly!

278
00:41:17,342 --> 00:41:18,468
Dear audience!

279
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:23,348
Now you'll see "Il Matto"
with his unique performance!

280
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:34,317
Hey, how are you up there?
Everything is fine?

281
00:41:34,484 --> 00:41:39,572
I'm fine, but it freshens up a little,
additionally I have a hunger!

282
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,575
You can say, I'm 2 times hungrier now!

283
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:46,830
This wind! It stole my napkin!

284
00:41:47,122 --> 00:41:52,711
Why you don't ask, whether someone
want to take a place with you?

285
00:41:53,253 --> 00:41:57,966
Who wants to come, is welcome!

286
00:42:38,381 --> 00:42:41,801
Thanks, thank you very much.

287
00:42:51,311 --> 00:42:53,062
One moment!

288
00:43:00,153 --> 00:43:03,281
- Anna, I'll wait for you at the tavern.
- All right.

289
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:13,708
Watch out!

290
00:43:16,586 --> 00:43:18,546
Make some room!

291
00:43:26,221 --> 00:43:29,682
Soldats! Attention!

292
00:43:30,099 --> 00:43:33,812
- One, two, one...
- A crazy girl!

293
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,818
I go home.

294
00:43:55,375 --> 00:44:00,630
- Hey, you want to drink some?
- She already drank more then us!

295
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:46,509
Get in.

296
00:44:51,431 --> 00:44:54,809
I don't want to go with you.
I don't want it anymore!

297
00:44:56,436 --> 00:44:57,937
No, never!

298
00:44:59,647 --> 00:45:01,065
Get in!

299
00:45:04,694 --> 00:45:06,195
Come here!

300
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,412
Move!

301
00:45:19,292 --> 00:45:20,543
Quickly!

302
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:24,047
And be quiet!

303
00:45:26,549 --> 00:45:28,676
You want to say something?

304
00:45:29,802 --> 00:45:31,429
Good, already thought you don't!

305
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,362
Good morning.

306
00:46:39,372 --> 00:46:41,124
Good morning.

307
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,575
Come over here!

308
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:21,706
Please, take a seat!

309
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:27,170
Say hello to the boss and his wife.

310
00:47:27,795 --> 00:47:31,466
Everything she knows, she learned from me.

311
00:47:31,966 --> 00:47:34,927
Do you want some coffee?

312
00:47:35,094 --> 00:47:37,430
Come on! Drink it.

313
00:47:38,306 --> 00:47:40,683
When I picked her up, she
didn't even have shoes.

314
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:44,353
But she didn't come around
much in the world yet.

315
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:50,109
Strong wind today. Do not
let the tent fly away!

316
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:56,240
There is no wage, you'll get anything,
what you'll be able to collect.

317
00:47:56,491 --> 00:48:00,745
Every artist goes around with
the hat, no one gets short.

318
00:48:00,995 --> 00:48:06,000
- I never had any controversies.
- You'll start today then.

319
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,711
I can see, you have one for the hat already.

320
00:48:09,087 --> 00:48:12,006
Take care of the tent, it flies away!

321
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,636
- Where are we here?
- In Rom, this is St. Paul.

322
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:21,015
And we'll work in a circus?

323
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:26,646
- Good material it is.
- Come with me, please.

324
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:33,653
- How many people go here altogether?
- 400 places, and ones, who stand...

325
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:36,864
Do You know him?

326
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:39,534
Good morning.

327
00:48:41,869 --> 00:48:45,289
Who we've got here! Mr. "Rufle"!

328
00:48:46,249 --> 00:48:50,795
It's great, that you gave him an
appointment, a good circus needs animals!

329
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:54,382
Sorry, I'm just kidding.
A cigarette?

330
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:58,302
Oh, you got one already.
He's really a great artist.

331
00:48:58,553 --> 00:49:01,806
A great program, but your best piece is

332
00:49:02,014 --> 00:49:04,392
that chain thing, this is phenomenal.

333
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,271
I give you a good advice:
Don't speak to me. Never!

334
00:49:08,938 --> 00:49:11,691
Otherwise there'll be a tragedy.
Got it?

335
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:16,028
- It was just a joke...
- I warned you.

336
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,450
Madame!

337
00:49:36,215 --> 00:49:38,426
Well done!

338
00:49:56,569 --> 00:49:57,987
Be brave, "Rufle"!

339
00:50:05,244 --> 00:50:06,621
What a poseur!

340
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:18,341
Stay calm, otherwise you'll fail!

341
00:50:19,258 --> 00:50:25,723
And now a new attraction in
the world famous circus "Girafa":

342
00:50:26,015 --> 00:50:30,478
Zampano! A man with lungs of steel.

343
00:50:42,281 --> 00:50:46,160
Dear audience!
Here is a chain, from what each

344
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:50,998
limb is thicker then 0.5 cm, pure
iron, stronger than steel!

345
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:57,797
I'll put it around my chest and
close it with this hook.

346
00:50:58,172 --> 00:51:02,051
By a simple expansion of the chest

347
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,305
muscles, I'll blow up the hook.

348
00:51:06,555 --> 00:51:10,434
You think the hook is a fake?
Wait a moment!

349
00:51:11,143 --> 00:51:13,562
Convince yourself!

350
00:51:15,773 --> 00:51:19,151
This patch I got for
protectional purposes...

351
00:51:21,529 --> 00:51:23,322
Bravo! Bravissimo!

352
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:29,954
But not to let you see how the
hook bores itself in the meat.

353
00:51:32,581 --> 00:51:36,085
You don't need to have
the strength of 4 bulls,

354
00:51:36,335 --> 00:51:38,337
You don't have to be a professor,

355
00:51:38,587 --> 00:51:42,049
in order to understand, that
for this unique attraction

356
00:51:42,216 --> 00:51:48,306
only three things are necessary:
Steel muscles, iron lungs

357
00:51:49,098 --> 00:51:51,100
and superhuman strength.

358
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:53,978
Leave the audience!

359
00:51:54,312 --> 00:51:57,606
Those, who have weak nerves,
should better look away...

360
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:02,111
It starts with a dull drumroll.

361
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,616
Signorina Gelsomina, please!

362
00:52:13,372 --> 00:52:16,334
Zampano, excuse me, a phone call for you!

363
00:52:27,470 --> 00:52:30,514
You bastard!
It's your turn now, come on, quick!

364
00:52:32,224 --> 00:52:35,102
Don't get angry, let me talk to him.

365
00:52:35,269 --> 00:52:36,771
I'll kill him!

366
00:52:37,355 --> 00:52:39,148
I'll kill him!

367
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,108
Where is he?

368
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:46,405
Where are you?

369
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:50,659
- Where are you?
- Be reasonable! Stay here!

370
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:56,916
- Did he hide here somewhere?
- Nobody's here.

371
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:00,878
Behind which stone did you crawl?

372
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,387
You'll have enough of your dumb jokes!

373
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:14,934
This coward hides from me...

374
00:53:28,155 --> 00:53:31,826
- Why is he so hostile to you?
- I don't know.

375
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:37,581
- You did something to him?
- Nothing, never did!

376
00:53:39,708 --> 00:53:44,547
He insults me, but one day
there'll be a payoff!

377
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,466
Who is he?

378
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:50,594
A son of a gipsy-

379
00:53:53,597 --> 00:53:56,350
- You know him from former times?
- Unfortunately I do.

380
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:02,189
Did Rosa know him too?

381
00:54:03,482 --> 00:54:06,861
He doesn't know anybody - neither
Rosa nor me, understood?

382
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:13,617
I don't want to hear anything about
him anymore. I go to bed.

383
00:55:16,305 --> 00:55:19,683
Here she comes! Look, how she walks!

384
00:55:23,312 --> 00:55:26,398
And what a face she has!
You see?

385
00:55:26,565 --> 00:55:29,568
You take this. Let's go.

386
00:55:29,818 --> 00:55:31,654
Put the bucket away.

387
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:36,575
I've got my own methods, they always work.

388
00:55:37,826 --> 00:55:41,205
- Gelsomina works with us!
- Calm down.

389
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:43,582
Try it.

390
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,338
Wonderful, what a talent!

391
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:51,048
And now, attention!

392
00:55:51,215 --> 00:55:54,927
I play the violin, and when you hear this...

393
00:55:56,929 --> 00:56:00,474
you sneak quietly behind me 'till there,

394
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:02,851
and blow the trombone.

395
00:56:03,477 --> 00:56:06,230
- Got it? Let's try.
- I can't.

396
00:56:07,314 --> 00:56:09,858
- Why?
- Zampano doesn't want me to.

397
00:56:10,484 --> 00:56:13,237
Do you hear that? Afterwards
I'll be accused again.

398
00:56:13,696 --> 00:56:17,825
Get Zampano. Let's see, who
decides here about whom.

399
00:56:17,992 --> 00:56:20,619
- He went to the city.
- I'll talk to him later then.

400
00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:23,998
Don't be afraid, we're one family,

401
00:56:24,206 --> 00:56:27,376
we work together. What you
learn is good for all of us.

402
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,379
Attention: When I play this...

403
00:56:33,007 --> 00:56:35,759
Got it? Really?

404
00:56:40,014 --> 00:56:44,393
Ladies and gentlemen, I'll play a very,

405
00:56:44,602 --> 00:56:47,146
very sad melody for you.

406
00:56:57,156 --> 00:56:59,116
Come on, now!

407
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:05,414
Wonderful! Very good.

408
00:57:05,664 --> 00:57:08,751
Travelling with Zampano
harms the intelligence!

409
00:57:09,126 --> 00:57:11,378
You should interrupt me

410
00:57:11,545 --> 00:57:15,049
and come where I am standing!

411
00:57:15,299 --> 00:57:18,177
We try it again. Now!

412
00:57:31,065 --> 00:57:32,524
Nice, you see?

413
00:57:32,691 --> 00:57:35,319
Watch out: We do it three times.

414
00:57:35,569 --> 00:57:37,780
Then I go around the manege,

415
00:57:37,946 --> 00:57:39,826
while you walk behind me
and blows the trombone.

416
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:42,576
Got it?
It's very simple.

417
00:57:42,826 --> 00:57:48,082
One finger here and the other there.

418
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:53,087
Bravo, Gelsomina!

419
00:57:53,295 --> 00:57:55,964
And now let's go:
One, two...

420
00:58:07,935 --> 00:58:11,563
What's the problem, Zampano?
I told her to work with him.

421
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:13,982
She works only with me.

422
00:58:15,984 --> 00:58:20,739
You weren't here, or I would have ask you.

423
00:58:20,989 --> 00:58:23,492
What's the big deal?
We work together here.

424
00:58:23,742 --> 00:58:25,744
She won't work with him!

425
00:58:25,953 --> 00:58:27,996
You will leave her in peace!

426
00:58:28,372 --> 00:58:30,833
I don't talk with you. You've
forbidden me to do it.

427
00:58:31,083 --> 00:58:32,283
Although I won't say anything.

428
00:58:32,751 --> 00:58:35,504
Go to my wife, Gelsomina,
I'll deal with this.

429
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,757
She stays here. I decide,
what she's got to do.

430
00:58:39,466 --> 00:58:43,220
And she's not allowed to
work with this vagabond!

431
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,264
- Why not?
- Because I want it that way.

432
00:58:45,514 --> 00:58:47,641
I want it that way.

433
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,352
If I'll see you once again with him...

434
00:58:55,023 --> 00:58:57,776
Zampano, let off him!

435
00:58:57,985 --> 00:59:00,779
Hold him back!

436
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,742
Run after them!

437
00:59:07,035 --> 00:59:10,289
These goddamn gypsies!

438
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:13,250
He's got a knife!

439
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:17,546
Calm down, nothing bad will happen.

440
00:59:29,266 --> 00:59:32,644
Be careful, he's got a knife!

441
00:59:37,316 --> 00:59:40,569
Don't make a step, or I'll kill you!

442
00:59:42,571 --> 00:59:44,323
Open up the door!

443
00:59:44,573 --> 00:59:45,908
Open up!

444
00:59:46,450 --> 00:59:48,285
Stay back!

445
00:59:53,665 --> 00:59:56,210
- What's the problem here?
- Nothing.

446
00:59:56,460 --> 00:59:59,087
Hey you, put the knife away!

447
01:00:01,048 --> 01:00:04,718
Nothing like that ever
happened in my circus!

448
01:00:04,927 --> 01:00:08,347
The police handcuffed and arrested him!

449
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:13,352
- But it wasn't his fault...
- We never had problems with police!

450
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,979
What do you want to do now?

451
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:19,233
You stay with us, otherwise
she'll look for this rude.

452
01:00:19,441 --> 01:00:24,446
You can be lucky, that it happened
this way, now you're free.

453
01:00:24,947 --> 01:00:28,951
What will you do alone? With us
you finally won't be hungry.

454
01:00:29,117 --> 01:00:30,452
But the motorcycle?

455
01:00:30,619 --> 01:00:34,873
- The police will keep an eye on it.
- Gelsomina, stay with us.

456
01:00:35,082 --> 01:00:39,253
- Where should I sleep?
- There's some room in my wagon.

457
01:00:39,503 --> 01:00:44,007
Now move it! The tractor will
arrive at half past four.

458
01:00:44,633 --> 01:00:46,969
You can come with us,

459
01:00:47,135 --> 01:00:49,012
but if you want to wait, then tell him,

460
01:00:49,263 --> 01:00:53,267
that I'll never work with him anymore.
And not with the other one! Never!

461
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:55,227
Let it down!

462
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:20,419
You were asleep already?

463
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:27,509
It stinks awful in here!
How you can stand it?

464
01:01:27,801 --> 01:01:33,056
No, Zampano is still in jail.
He'll be free by tomorrow, perhaps.

465
01:01:34,308 --> 01:01:36,643
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, perhaps.

466
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:42,649
It's all your fault. Zampano
didn't do anything to you.

467
01:01:42,941 --> 01:01:45,694
And they let you go first.

468
01:01:45,903 --> 01:01:50,532
I agree, in a certain way I'm
the cause of his misfortune.

469
01:01:50,699 --> 01:01:53,452
But he had the knife.

470
01:01:55,037 --> 01:01:56,204
Come out.

471
01:01:58,040 --> 01:01:59,333
Come!

472
01:02:00,292 --> 01:02:02,961
Perhaps the prison will be of use for him.

473
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,714
He still got so many years to live!

474
01:02:05,964 --> 01:02:08,216
But with me it'll be over soon.

475
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:12,846
Nice gown you have!
Take a seat.

476
01:02:19,478 --> 01:02:20,854
Come on. Sit down.

477
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:28,236
What a strange face!

478
01:02:29,363 --> 01:02:32,991
Are you really a woman?
You look like an artichoke!

479
01:02:38,205 --> 01:02:40,832
I don't know yet, if I'll stay with Zampano.

480
01:02:41,124 --> 01:02:42,751
I can go with the circus.

481
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:46,004
The best chance to get rid of him.

482
01:02:51,009 --> 01:02:56,598
He'll look funny, when he'll be
released from jail and all are away!

483
01:02:57,891 --> 01:03:02,771
That's how you have to do it!
That will be fun!

484
01:03:05,023 --> 01:03:07,150
I don't have anything against him.

485
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:11,655
But when I see his face, all
my limbs itch to hit him.

486
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,991
I don't know why at all.

487
01:03:14,741 --> 01:03:17,536
I just can't hold me back.

488
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:24,543
But you, how you two came together?

489
01:03:25,419 --> 01:03:27,295
He gave 10.000 Lire to my mother.

490
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,297
That much?

491
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:32,009
I've got four sisters, all younger than me.

492
01:03:33,927 --> 01:03:35,929
Do you like him?

493
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:39,516
- Me?
- Yes, you! Who else?

494
01:03:39,808 --> 01:03:42,310
Why you won't run away from him?

495
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:47,441
I tried already, but I can't.

496
01:03:48,775 --> 01:03:51,945
What do you mean, "but I can't"?

497
01:03:52,696 --> 01:03:56,450
You can stay with him or go with the circus.

498
01:03:58,577 --> 01:04:01,288
If I go with them or with Zampano,

499
01:04:01,455 --> 01:04:04,541
it's the same for me.

500
01:04:04,708 --> 01:04:07,586
It doesn't make a difference.

501
01:04:07,794 --> 01:04:11,339
Nobody needs me.

502
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:16,219
What for do I live?

503
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:23,351
- Can you cook?
- What?

504
01:04:24,102 --> 01:04:26,605
You're a good cook?

505
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:28,565
No.

506
01:04:29,357 --> 01:04:32,444
What can you do then?
Dancing? Singing?

507
01:04:32,611 --> 01:04:34,571
A little.

508
01:04:35,363 --> 01:04:36,948
Maybe...

509
01:04:38,992 --> 01:04:42,079
it's love, which brings you joy?

510
01:04:45,582 --> 01:04:48,001
You have to enjoy anything.

511
01:04:50,504 --> 01:04:53,215
If you would be not that ugly...

512
01:04:54,216 --> 01:04:58,261
Why am I born to this world?

513
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:05,477
And if I'll offer you to come with me?

514
01:05:05,644 --> 01:05:07,521
I'll teach you to become a ropedancer.

515
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:11,108
High above, in the spotlights!

516
01:05:11,399 --> 01:05:13,985
I've got a car, we can drive around,

517
01:05:14,152 --> 01:05:18,406
we'll have a lot of fun!
What do you think?

518
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:23,495
You don't want to...

519
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:28,542
You have to stay with Zampano, to be
involved in all his stupid things

520
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:32,921
and let him hit you like a donkey!

521
01:05:37,259 --> 01:05:39,636
That's life.

522
01:05:40,887 --> 01:05:46,017
But, Zampano must keep you only,
because he's got something on you.

523
01:05:47,561 --> 01:05:51,064
You already ran away once, what he did then?

524
01:05:51,314 --> 01:05:53,942
He's beaten me up.

525
01:05:56,444 --> 01:05:59,698
Why he didn't let you go?

526
01:06:01,825 --> 01:06:03,201
Strange,

527
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:08,039
I won't keep you one day
more then necessary!

528
01:06:08,915 --> 01:06:10,584
Maybe...

529
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,964
Maybe he likes you?

530
01:06:16,715 --> 01:06:18,967
Zampano? Me?

531
01:06:19,217 --> 01:06:22,470
Yes, he's like a dog:

532
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:27,225
A dog, who looks like he's trying
to speak, but can only bark.

533
01:06:27,475 --> 01:06:29,811
Poor Zampano.

534
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:36,359
Yea, poor...

535
01:06:39,237 --> 01:06:40,447
But...

536
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:44,367
if you won't stay with him, who else will?

537
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:49,623
I'm not educated well, just
read a couple of books.

538
01:06:49,956 --> 01:06:54,711
Every existing thing, is here on purpose.

539
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,755
For example...

540
01:06:57,005 --> 01:06:59,883
- This stone here...
- Which one?

541
01:07:00,133 --> 01:07:03,762
This one. It's here for some reason.

542
01:07:04,012 --> 01:07:05,889
And this little stone...

543
01:07:06,514 --> 01:07:08,642
- For what?
- For...

544
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:10,644
What do I know?!

545
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:12,854
If I knew that, then I would be...

546
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:15,649
the almighty God, who knows everything.

547
01:07:15,899 --> 01:07:20,237
When you're born, when you
die, who knows that.

548
01:07:23,281 --> 01:07:28,036
I don't know for what that stone is
good, but it has got its function.

549
01:07:28,286 --> 01:07:31,665
Or everything would be meaningless.

550
01:07:32,874 --> 01:07:34,876
Even the stars.

551
01:07:35,502 --> 01:07:37,295
That's, what I believe at least.

552
01:07:38,672 --> 01:07:40,507
And you...

553
01:07:41,174 --> 01:07:43,760
You're good for something as well.

554
01:07:43,927 --> 01:07:47,264
With your artichokelike face.

555
01:08:06,324 --> 01:08:10,078
I'll buy some matches tomorrow
and lit everything!

556
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,706
Mattresses, sheets, everything!

557
01:08:13,206 --> 01:08:14,791
So he'll understand!

558
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:17,585
I didn't say, I don't want to go with him.

559
01:08:17,836 --> 01:08:21,673
He paid 10.000 Lire, I do the
whole work and he sleeps!

560
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:27,929
That's his nature. He
doesn't think at all.

561
01:08:28,179 --> 01:08:30,557
I tell him that and
he says: "Whatever. "

562
01:08:30,807 --> 01:08:32,392
What is that good for?

563
01:08:32,559 --> 01:08:35,270
And he'll get some poison either!
In his soup.

564
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:38,815
No, I better burn it all up!

565
01:08:39,441 --> 01:08:42,319
And if I won't stay with him,
who else will do?

566
01:08:46,781 --> 01:08:50,327
So they said, that you can stay with them?

567
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:55,457
Wake up!

568
01:08:55,707 --> 01:08:59,669
Did they really say, that
you could stay with them?

569
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:03,548
They didn't say anything about me?

570
01:09:04,215 --> 01:09:08,970
They didn't want to work with
you anymore. Or with Zampano.

571
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:15,602
As if it is of a big value
for me, to work with them.

572
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:18,605
They need me, but I don't need anybody!

573
01:09:18,813 --> 01:09:20,565
Today I'm here, tomorrow somewhere else!

574
01:09:20,732 --> 01:09:24,819
I get bored too fast. Freedom is
the most important thing for me.

575
01:09:24,986 --> 01:09:27,447
That's how I am.

576
01:09:27,614 --> 01:09:31,576
I don't even need a warm place to sleep.

577
01:09:31,993 --> 01:09:35,580
Why did you say, that you'll die soon?

578
01:09:36,373 --> 01:09:40,877
I am often thinking about death.
Must be the profession.

579
01:09:43,213 --> 01:09:44,839
And suddenly it's over.

580
01:09:45,006 --> 01:09:48,009
Once I'll break my neck,
no one will cry for me.

581
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:49,886
And your mother?

582
01:09:52,639 --> 01:09:55,892
So, will you wait for him?
Or you'll go with them?

583
01:09:58,353 --> 01:10:03,358
So you want to be with him,
I'll bring you to the police.

584
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:07,153
Then you'll be right there,
when they release him.

585
01:10:08,655 --> 01:10:11,533
He'll be surprised!

586
01:10:32,679 --> 01:10:34,806
What a hell of a device!

587
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:36,808
Get out!

588
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,771
There are the barracks.

589
01:10:48,820 --> 01:10:51,030
So long.

590
01:10:51,823 --> 01:10:53,158
You're leaving?

591
01:10:53,658 --> 01:10:57,704
Yes, or do you want to come with me?

592
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:07,046
What should I do with a girl,
who isn't good for anything?

593
01:11:13,845 --> 01:11:17,932
Gelsomina...

594
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:21,728
Here is...

595
01:11:24,230 --> 01:11:26,232
a little souvenir.

596
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:59,224
So long, Gelsomina!

597
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,664
Zampano, here I am.

598
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,173
The circus people wanted to keep me,

599
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:34,884
- but...
- You could have gone then.

600
01:13:43,369 --> 01:13:47,123
- In which direction is our house?
- There.

601
01:13:59,135 --> 01:14:02,513
I wanted to go back home once,

602
01:14:02,722 --> 01:14:06,476
but now it's not important anymore.

603
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,774
Now my home is with you.

604
01:14:13,858 --> 01:14:16,235
Really?
What a great discovery,

605
01:14:16,402 --> 01:14:21,282
you were hungry at home!
You're better with me.

606
01:14:22,492 --> 01:14:25,995
You're an animal!
Nothing in your head!

607
01:14:30,166 --> 01:14:33,795
- Then it'll be a time for fasting?
- Never!

608
01:14:36,047 --> 01:14:40,426
A storm is coming up, where
is the next village?

609
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:46,265
Magliano, 18 km from here,
but it's behind the mountains.

610
01:14:46,683 --> 01:14:50,812
We won't get there - not
enough fuel in tank!

611
01:14:53,564 --> 01:14:56,442
There is our monastery.

612
01:15:07,328 --> 01:15:08,705
Please, wait.

613
01:15:08,913 --> 01:15:11,082
Matron, I've got the oil.

614
01:15:11,290 --> 01:15:15,211
May this man stay with us for one night?

615
01:15:16,838 --> 01:15:20,341
Excuse me, we don't have enough fuel left,

616
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:24,470
it's getting dark soon, it's still
far until we reach the village

617
01:15:24,721 --> 01:15:26,681
and my wife doesn't feel well...

618
01:15:28,224 --> 01:15:31,978
- He can sleep in the barn, maybe?
- Well, but only for one night.

619
01:15:32,228 --> 01:15:36,566
She allowed it, there is
enough room in the barn.

620
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:39,944
Thank you, matron.

621
01:15:46,617 --> 01:15:50,621
- I've got something else for you.
- Thanks.

622
01:15:57,211 --> 01:16:00,882
- And you, you want some more?
- Come on and take it.

623
01:16:06,012 --> 01:16:09,223
She works with you?

624
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:12,351
She helps me a little bit.

625
01:16:12,518 --> 01:16:16,147
Blows the trumpet, plays the tambourine.

626
01:16:16,522 --> 01:16:19,025
Show, what you can do to the sister.

627
01:17:03,945 --> 01:17:05,822
Great!

628
01:17:06,405 --> 01:17:09,826
- How well you can play!
- Yes, now do the dishes!

629
01:17:10,076 --> 01:17:12,453
- No, I'll do it.
- That's her job to do.

630
01:17:12,703 --> 01:17:17,917
We'll do it together.
How beautiful it sounded!

631
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:22,421
- What's this melody?
- I don't know.

632
01:17:23,589 --> 01:17:25,925
What are you trying to do?

633
01:17:26,551 --> 01:17:29,470
That's not the right work to
do for a sister like you.

634
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,850
- Hand it over.
- I'm doing this every day.

635
01:17:40,106 --> 01:17:42,733
You always sleep inside of it?

636
01:17:42,942 --> 01:17:47,613
It's enough space. I got a lamp,
some pottery, like in a real home.

637
01:17:47,864 --> 01:17:52,577
Very nice. Do you like the travelling?

638
01:17:52,743 --> 01:17:57,206
- That's his work.
- We use to move along as well.

639
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:59,750
Every two years we have to
move to another monastery.

640
01:18:00,001 --> 01:18:02,253
- This is my second already.
- And why?

641
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:05,631
So we can't get used to secular things.

642
01:18:05,882 --> 01:18:10,761
If you stay longer at one place,
you start to like it

643
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:15,766
and forgets, what's more important,
then anything on earth, God.

644
01:18:17,268 --> 01:18:21,397
We both are travellers: She
follows her God, I follow mine.

645
01:18:21,647 --> 01:18:27,028
- Yes, each one follows her own.
- You would like to inspect the monastery?

646
01:18:27,278 --> 01:18:31,490
Please, accompany me. The monastery
is over 1000 years old.

647
01:18:47,673 --> 01:18:49,550
Why are you taking me with you?

648
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:53,262
I don't look good, I can't cook,
can't do anything...

649
01:18:54,055 --> 01:18:55,806
What happened?

650
01:18:58,142 --> 01:19:00,061
Go to sleep.

651
01:19:01,187 --> 01:19:03,940
What strange things you're thinking about?

652
01:19:16,786 --> 01:19:21,082
It's raining.
It is nice here.

653
01:19:27,338 --> 01:19:30,466
Will you be sorry about me, if I'll die?

654
01:19:33,427 --> 01:19:35,846
Why do you want to die?

655
01:19:36,931 --> 01:19:39,308
I wanted to die once.

656
01:19:39,558 --> 01:19:43,479
Be dead is better then to
stay with him, I thought.

657
01:19:48,484 --> 01:19:52,321
Now I'm ready even to marry you.

658
01:19:53,739 --> 01:19:59,495
We'll stay together. Even a
stone is good for anything.

659
01:19:59,996 --> 01:20:04,834
You have to consider sometimes.
But you never reflect on things!

660
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:08,254
- There is nothing to think about.
- But yes, there is!

661
01:20:09,463 --> 01:20:12,967
And what do you want to think?!
Sleep immediately.

662
01:20:13,259 --> 01:20:16,095
I don't want to listen to this crap anymore!

663
01:20:16,262 --> 01:20:18,639
Sleep, I'm tired.

664
01:20:34,989 --> 01:20:37,658
Do you like me a little bit?

665
01:20:54,759 --> 01:20:56,552
Stop it!

666
01:21:33,839 --> 01:21:36,842
There are silver hearts hangin,

667
01:21:37,093 --> 01:21:39,595
but my hands are too big, you have to try!

668
01:21:41,472 --> 01:21:44,600
- No, I don't want to.
- What has got into you?

669
01:21:50,064 --> 01:21:53,234
- No, you can't do this!
- Be quiet!

670
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,621
Thank you, venerable matron.

671
01:22:06,997 --> 01:22:09,250
Thank you, good bye.

672
01:22:11,127 --> 01:22:13,379
She cries! Wait a moment.

673
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:15,881
Why are you crying?

674
01:22:18,259 --> 01:22:20,386
Do you want to stay here?

675
01:22:21,637 --> 01:22:24,140
I'll speak to the matron.

676
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:28,519
Sisters!

677
01:22:28,894 --> 01:22:30,479
Here, put that away.

678
01:22:30,771 --> 01:22:35,651
Thank you for your kind heart
and the hospitality.

679
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:39,864
Thank you very much from
a modest artist like me.

680
01:22:40,281 --> 01:22:41,490
Push!

681
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:54,355
"Rufle"! You're right on time.

682
01:24:06,116 --> 01:24:08,869
I would also help you.

683
01:24:18,504 --> 01:24:20,256
But, "Rufle"!

684
01:24:25,135 --> 01:24:27,012
Throw that thing away!

685
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:36,105
That's for your dumb jokes!

686
01:24:37,022 --> 01:24:39,400
Zampano, stop it! That's enough!

687
01:24:41,902 --> 01:24:44,989
You're trying to kill me?

688
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:54,039
- That was the gift from the "Rufle"!
- Come on! Please!

689
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,418
- Next time you'll have more!
- Any more?

690
01:25:03,382 --> 01:25:05,426
He broke my watch!

691
01:25:27,948 --> 01:25:32,036
Zampano, come quick, he's really bad!

692
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:38,959
He's bad...

693
01:25:47,426 --> 01:25:48,802
He dies...

694
01:25:53,098 --> 01:25:57,311
- Don't be a fool!
- He dies...

695
01:25:59,855 --> 01:26:01,440
He dies...

696
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:09,365
Be quiet!

697
01:26:10,240 --> 01:26:11,450
Hey, you?

698
01:26:25,756 --> 01:26:27,257
Be quiet!

699
01:26:30,594 --> 01:26:33,263
Be quiet finally!

700
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:42,272
I'm in deep shit now.

701
01:28:25,584 --> 01:28:29,004
Those, who are sensible, should look away,

702
01:28:29,213 --> 01:28:32,466
when the hook gets into
the flesh, it can bleed!

703
01:28:32,633 --> 01:28:35,010
Here comes the announcing drum roll!

704
01:28:35,219 --> 01:28:37,387
Gelsomina, please!

705
01:28:40,724 --> 01:28:43,477
Signorina Gelsomina!
Drum roll, please!

706
01:28:49,024 --> 01:28:51,902
"Il Matto", he feels bad...

707
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:58,158
"Il Matto", he feels bad...

708
01:29:25,686 --> 01:29:28,772
What do you think?
What has got into you?

709
01:29:32,192 --> 01:29:35,445
Nobody have seen us,
nobody is looking for us!

710
01:29:36,822 --> 01:29:39,575
No one think about it, not even us.

711
01:29:43,829 --> 01:29:45,330
I'm hungry-

712
01:29:47,916 --> 01:29:49,668
Stay here.

713
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:51,962
I'll deal with it.

714
01:30:20,115 --> 01:30:21,617
Where are you going?

715
01:30:25,495 --> 01:30:27,372
Where are you going?

716
01:30:30,250 --> 01:30:32,753
Where are you heading? Tell me.

717
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:44,890
You want to go back home?

718
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:06,995
Here.

719
01:31:08,997 --> 01:31:10,749
Eat something.

720
01:31:13,543 --> 01:31:16,505
Stop the blubbering! That's enough!

721
01:31:18,173 --> 01:31:20,634
I can't hear it any longer!

722
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,264
- I'll take a rest now.
- No!

723
01:31:28,058 --> 01:31:29,768
Don't come in!

724
01:31:31,019 --> 01:31:33,563
All right, I'll sleep outside.

725
01:32:09,224 --> 01:32:12,728
- It's nice here.
- It's cold.

726
01:32:16,857 --> 01:32:18,483
Sit down.

727
01:32:19,484 --> 01:32:21,486
Get some sunlight.

728
01:32:57,856 --> 01:33:00,233
Let's eat some soup.

729
01:33:13,622 --> 01:33:14,873
Something's missing.

730
01:33:15,248 --> 01:33:18,418
No need, I'll do it.

731
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:26,301
Finally! You didn't make
a move for ten days!

732
01:33:34,893 --> 01:33:39,689
I didn't want to kill him.
I only hit him twice.

733
01:33:40,190 --> 01:33:45,070
He was fine, just some nose bleeding.

734
01:33:45,946 --> 01:33:48,448
Then I let off him.

735
01:33:49,324 --> 01:33:52,536
Do I have to end in jail
because of some fight?

736
01:33:52,702 --> 01:33:56,081
I only want to do my work.
Do I not have a right to live?

737
01:34:11,721 --> 01:34:15,350
Finally we can move along once again.

738
01:34:16,059 --> 01:34:18,603
There is a big fair,

739
01:34:19,104 --> 01:34:23,483
a couple of kilometers ahead.
We can earn good money there.

740
01:34:24,734 --> 01:34:27,445
What? What do you have again?

741
01:34:29,948 --> 01:34:31,867
"Il Matto", he feels bad.

742
01:34:45,130 --> 01:34:47,841
I'll bring you back home.

743
01:34:48,758 --> 01:34:51,219
You want back to your mother?

744
01:34:53,597 --> 01:34:56,099
You don't want back to your mother?

745
01:34:56,516 --> 01:34:59,644
If I won't stay with you, who else will do?

746
01:35:00,020 --> 01:35:02,647
But it can't go on like that.

747
01:35:03,023 --> 01:35:05,775
I have to earn money again!

748
01:35:06,276 --> 01:35:08,778
You're crazy! Crazy!

749
01:35:19,164 --> 01:35:23,418
If you want to sleep, then go
inside, it's too cold here.

750
01:35:24,669 --> 01:35:26,379
We have to move on.

751
01:35:34,137 --> 01:35:39,309
You have killed him.
It's really nice here, outside.

752
01:35:40,685 --> 01:35:45,690
I wanted to go away from you,
but he said, I should stay.

753
01:35:50,070 --> 01:35:55,033
We need more wood for the fire.

754
01:38:11,294 --> 01:38:15,715
Today, Gala performance by the
world famous circus "Medini"!

755
01:38:15,965 --> 01:38:21,096
International attractions!
Oriental artists!

756
01:38:21,346 --> 01:38:26,059
And sketches, from which you'll
fall off the chairs!

757
01:38:29,604 --> 01:38:32,732
Our name means a

758
01:38:32,941 --> 01:38:36,361
quality obligation for us!

759
01:38:36,611 --> 01:38:40,865
Let's go home now, children.

760
01:38:41,116 --> 01:38:45,829
Come with your parents today!
Children pay half entrance.

761
01:38:45,995 --> 01:38:48,998
- Where do you go?
- Just a bit.

762
01:38:49,999 --> 01:38:51,876
Should I accompany you?

763
01:38:53,253 --> 01:38:55,213
No, I'll be back n a minute.

764
01:39:07,016 --> 01:39:09,102
One for 30.

765
01:39:14,732 --> 01:39:16,609
And some lemon.

766
01:40:11,331 --> 01:40:12,582
Hey, you there!

767
01:40:13,333 --> 01:40:16,211
Where do you know it from?
That melody.

768
01:40:16,711 --> 01:40:20,465
- Which melody?
- One you just sang.

769
01:40:20,715 --> 01:40:22,300
Oh, you mean this one...

770
01:40:25,845 --> 01:40:29,224
It's from a girl, who stayed with us.

771
01:40:29,432 --> 01:40:30,975
When?

772
01:40:31,226 --> 01:40:34,354
That was long time ago.
Four or five years back.

773
01:40:34,604 --> 01:40:38,858
She always played it on her
trumpet, I'll never forget it.

774
01:40:40,568 --> 01:40:41,945
And where is she now?

775
01:40:42,987 --> 01:40:45,240
She has died.

776
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:51,246
Are you a circus artist? She was
of the same kind, a vagabond.

777
01:40:51,454 --> 01:40:53,894
Maybe you have known her. Nobody
around here used to know her.

778
01:40:54,123 --> 01:40:56,000
She never have spoken.

779
01:40:56,501 --> 01:41:01,965
She was a little bit crazy.
My father found her near the beach.

780
01:41:02,715 --> 01:41:05,635
She was ill. Some sort of fever.

781
01:41:05,885 --> 01:41:09,889
We took her to us, but
she never said anything,

782
01:41:10,098 --> 01:41:14,018
only cried. She hasn't
eaten anything too.

783
01:41:14,269 --> 01:41:17,272
When she felt better, she used to
sit outside and play the trumpet.

784
01:41:17,522 --> 01:41:20,525
And one morning. She didn't wake up.

785
01:41:20,775 --> 01:41:25,363
Our mayor tried to find
some relatives of her.

786
01:41:26,739 --> 01:41:29,367
Do you want to see the mayor?

787
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:12,201
And now Zampano, the man with iron lungs!

788
01:42:12,452 --> 01:42:16,414
After him a posse, you'll laugh about a lot!

789
01:42:16,581 --> 01:42:17,832
Music!

790
01:42:32,055 --> 01:42:34,182
Ladies and gentlemen,

791
01:42:34,724 --> 01:42:38,478
a chain and a hook, 0.5 cm thick,

792
01:42:38,728 --> 01:42:44,233
pure iron, stronger then steel,
through an expansion...

793
01:42:44,484 --> 01:42:48,196
of my breast muscles...
and my lungs...

794
01:42:48,488 --> 01:42:53,117
I blow up this hook. This
here is not to protect me,

795
01:42:53,368 --> 01:42:56,746
but to spare you

796
01:42:57,121 --> 01:43:01,125
the view of a blood stained
hook in my flesh.

797
01:43:02,085 --> 01:43:05,004
If somebody has got weak nerves,

798
01:43:05,630 --> 01:43:07,757
then look away, please.

799
01:43:13,262 --> 01:43:16,641
- Finish, you had enough.
- Leave me alone.

800
01:43:16,891 --> 01:43:19,644
- Then go somewhere else.
- I said leave me alone!

801
01:43:19,894 --> 01:43:21,270
I'll bring you out!

802
01:43:21,521 --> 01:43:23,272
- You're disturbing other guests.
- Waiter!

803
01:43:23,523 --> 01:43:28,277
Go now, come on.
And stop the drinking!

804
01:43:28,611 --> 01:43:31,614
Please, get reasonable.
Come, I'll bring you out.

805
01:43:31,781 --> 01:43:33,366
Go to hell, I'll go alone!

806
01:43:33,533 --> 01:43:36,911
- Don't touch me!
- There is the exit.

807
01:43:37,370 --> 01:43:39,872
- He gets drunk like this every day.
- Son of a bitch!

808
01:43:40,039 --> 01:43:44,377
- Stop it, please!
- Damn vagabond!

809
01:43:49,799 --> 01:43:52,635
I'll break all your bones...

810
01:43:52,802 --> 01:43:55,012
Let off me!

811
01:43:57,557 --> 01:43:59,934
Let me...

812
01:44:00,143 --> 01:44:02,812
Go away!

813
01:44:03,020 --> 01:44:06,691
Come here, I'll get done with all of you!

814
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:10,570
Let off me, I'll show it to
that son of a bitch!

815
01:44:11,028 --> 01:44:14,073
Teach him a lesson, so he'll have enough.

816
01:44:17,827 --> 01:44:21,330
Miserable drinker! You
still haven't had enough?

817
01:44:27,795 --> 01:44:32,592
- Zampano, get calm.
- Let off me!

818
01:44:34,927 --> 01:44:39,098
- It has no point...
- Don't touch me!

819
01:44:43,102 --> 01:44:46,230
If I wouldn't be your friend,
I've already called the police.

820
01:44:46,439 --> 01:44:49,108
I don't want any friends!

821
01:44:55,573 --> 01:44:59,619
Why all of you don't come out?

822
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:02,997
Come out now!

823
01:45:03,748 --> 01:45:05,750
I'll show you!

824
01:45:06,584 --> 01:45:07,585
I'll finish you all!

825
01:45:16,260 --> 01:45:19,263
I don't need anybody!

826
01:45:20,389 --> 01:45:23,017
I want to be alone!

827
01:45:23,226 --> 01:45:24,769
Alone!
