1
00:02:01,571 --> 00:02:03,471
- Code message, sir.
- Thanks.

2
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,336
- Harper, code message.
- Yes, sir.

3
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:04,309
All right, fellas, everything
clear now to the pilots?

4
00:03:04,334 --> 00:03:05,801
- Major Roberts.
- Yes, Quincannon?

5
00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:07,989
- Gonna use the radio beam all the way, sir?
- Yes.

6
00:03:08,014 --> 00:03:10,715
To keep a double check, flight
leaders will work Hickam radio control...

7
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,317
while the other planes work the
home station. How about the navigators?

8
00:03:14,342 --> 00:03:15,775
- One question, sir.
- How soon...?

9
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,958
- Sorry.
- Hauser?

10
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:19,417
How soon will we get our maps
and tracks from Group Operation, sir?

11
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:23,228
Anytime you want them. You'll
be given the route weather
forecast soon as it's finished.

12
00:03:23,353 --> 00:03:25,663
- Wendell?
- That's what I wanted to know, sir.

13
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:27,506
Are there any questions
from the bombardiers?

14
00:03:27,531 --> 00:03:28,948
- Major Roberts, sir.
- Parker.

15
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:31,100
- What about ammunition?
- No ammunition.

16
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
- Yes, McMartin?
- Are we taking bombsights along, sir?

17
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,955
We're ferrying them fully
equipped, except for ammunition.

18
00:03:36,986 --> 00:03:39,291
The maintenance crews are
working on them now, so you pilots

19
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:41,622
can check with them to be
sure everything's in shape.

20
00:03:41,647 --> 00:03:43,945
- And Harper, you'll check for us.
- Yes, sir.

21
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,569
I guess that's all for now.

22
00:03:45,594 --> 00:03:49,428
Oh, yes. The crews haven't been told yet
what the destination is, so keep it quiet.

23
00:03:49,612 --> 00:03:51,944
- Anything else?
- How about phoning our wives, sir?

24
00:03:52,248 --> 00:03:55,615
Evidently your copilot doesn't
take you into his confidence.

25
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,720
He got permission this morning
to send a radiogram to Lt.
McMartin's sister in Honolulu.

26
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:02,353
I thought that might interest you,
McMartin.

27
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:04,437
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I guess that's about all.

28
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:08,815
We'll meet here 30 minutes before
takeoff time for final instructions.

29
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:23,640
- How's everything, sergeant?
- Everything's going fine, sir.

30
00:04:23,813 --> 00:04:26,782
Gotta put a new magneto on number two.
Gear's shot.

31
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:29,209
They told me to get her ready
for a long trip.

32
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,478
- They didn't tell me where.
- They didn't, huh?

33
00:04:31,503 --> 00:04:33,747
- No, sir.
- Can you keep a secret, sergeant?

34
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:36,895
- Yes, sir.
- That's good.

35
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,701
Captain Quincannon?

36
00:04:40,957 --> 00:04:43,824
Private Chester reporting, sir.
Second radio.

37
00:04:43,972 --> 00:04:45,439
Sergeant White, your crew chief.

38
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,065
- How are you?
- How do you do?

39
00:04:47,236 --> 00:04:50,637
- Glad to have you with us.
- I'm glad to be assigned to your airplane.

40
00:04:50,807 --> 00:04:53,742
I've been hoping to get on a Flying Fortress
since radio school.

41
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,810
- How long ago was that?
- Three months ago.

42
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:58,140
I've had experience.
I've been in light bombers.

43
00:04:58,314 --> 00:05:01,408
That's fine.
Better turn him over to Peterson, sergeant.

44
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:04,246
He can look over the radio set
and get the hang of things.

45
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,684
- I'll be in Operations if you want me.
- Yes, sir.

46
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:09,051
You'll find Peterson inside, son.

47
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:13,959
- Must be a big flight. Nine Fortresses.
- So they say.

48
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,724
Do you know...?
I mean, can you tell me where we're going?

49
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,467
- Can... Can you keep a secret?
- Oh, yes, sir.

50
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,229
That's good.

51
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,079
- Hello.
- Hello. Are you the new gunner?

52
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,579
- No, second radio.
- Yeah?

53
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,345
- My name's Weinberg, second engineer.
- Chester's my name. Glad to know you.

54
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,353
- Glad to know you.
- Hey, is that what they call her, Mary-Ann?

55
00:05:40,523 --> 00:05:42,991
That's her.
And she's the best ship in the outfit.

56
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,252
Hey, Peterson,
here's your new static chaser.

57
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,157
- My name's Chester.
- How are you?

58
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,696
Come on, I'll show you around.

59
00:05:54,737 --> 00:05:57,103
- Hey, you the crew chief?
- Yeah.

60
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,070
My name's White.
Are you the new gunner?

61
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:00,539
Yeah, Winocki. Joe Winocki.

62
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,871
We've been expecting you.
Put your stuff inside.

63
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,035
- Okay.
- You're lucky.

64
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:07,546
- Our regular gunner's on furlough.
- I wouldn't say I'm lucky.

65
00:06:36,446 --> 00:06:39,108
- Looks like everything's okay, sergeant.
- I think so, sir.

66
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,512
- How about coffee and sandwiches?
- Got them, sir.

67
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:45,484
- I wish we could get ahold of extra oxygen.
- Already inside the plane, sir.

68
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,452
- How'd you do that?
- Six bottles.

69
00:06:47,623 --> 00:06:51,719
- You haven't got an extra engine, have you?
- Almost enough parts to build one, I guess.

70
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:55,596
I'm getting sort of worried about my wife.
She should be here by now.

71
00:06:55,765 --> 00:06:56,993
Oh, Winocki.

72
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,657
- Yeah?
- This is our new gunner, sir.

73
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,633
Captain Quincannon.

74
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,068
- Don't I know you, sergeant?
- I think you do, sir.

75
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,231
- You were at Randolph Field?
- That's right.

76
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:08,775
- About two years ago?
- Two and a half, sir.

77
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:11,243
- While I was instructing there.
- That's right.

78
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:13,974
- Oh, I remem...
- I think you remember.

79
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,846
- Anything else, sir?
- Not now, no.

80
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:28,297
Anyhow, I guess that new radioman
of ours is a pretty good kid.

81
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:31,524
- Yeah, I guess he is.
- We're getting them right off the bottle.

82
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,033
We were all pretty young
when we started out.

83
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,194
How old is that kid of yours
you talk about?

84
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,964
- Twenty-one.
- Where is he stationed?

85
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:40,974
Clark Field, Manila.
They got him in one of those Peashooters.

86
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:42,133
Just got a boost too.

87
00:07:42,311 --> 00:07:46,042
If he gets another bar on his shoulders,
you're gonna have to have a bigger head.

88
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:50,276
- Imagine me saluting my own kid.
- You'd pin his ears down if he didn't take it.

89
00:07:52,088 --> 00:07:54,386
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind if...?

90
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,387
Well, my mother would like to meet you.

91
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,195
Sure.

92
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,665
Mother, this is Captain Quincannon.

93
00:08:12,842 --> 00:08:14,207
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

94
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:17,437
Mighty nice of you to turn out
at this time of night to see us off.

95
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:19,877
I wanted to meet you, captain, because...

96
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:23,416
well, I couldn't help wondering
what kind of a...

97
00:08:24,053 --> 00:08:27,682
- You'll take good care of him, won't you?
- In a way, he'll be looking after me.

98
00:08:27,857 --> 00:08:29,950
That's the way
the crew of a bomber functions.

99
00:08:30,126 --> 00:08:31,855
- I wouldn't worry any.
- I won't.

100
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:33,723
We haven't much time left, Chester.

101
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:36,421
Don't worry about our radioman.
It's a routine flight.

102
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,760
- He'll be back in a couple of weeks.
- Thank you.

103
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,062
- Goodbye, Mrs. Chester.
- Goodbye.

104
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,106
I'll write to you, Mom,
so you'll know where I am.

105
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,272
Did you bring this for me?

106
00:08:58,988 --> 00:09:02,890
Take care of yourself, Mom.
Don't worry about me. I'll be all right.

107
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,124
Goodbye, son.

108
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,991
Goodbye, Mom.

109
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,465
Haven't seen Mrs. Quincannon, have you?

110
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:15,900
- I haven't. I've been watching, sir.
- Well, I guess I've been ditched.

111
00:09:16,072 --> 00:09:18,597
- You better get aboard, Chester.
- Yes, sir.

112
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,706
Irish!

113
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,779
- Irish.
- It's about time, Mrs. Quincannon.

114
00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:30,282
- Did you have another date?
- Flat tire. You ever try to get a taxi here?

115
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:32,512
- I was scared I wouldn't make it.
- So was I.

116
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:36,624
And I couldn't bring Michael. It's a little
too late for him, but he sent you this.

117
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,653
And this.

118
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:41,422
Thanks.

119
00:09:41,597 --> 00:09:44,862
- Darling, couldn't I stow away?
- Do you wanna get me court-martialed?

120
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,299
I'll be back in a couple weeks.
We'll take time off for that honeymoon.

121
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:51,372
I remember every honeymoon
we didn't have. Even the first one.

122
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,768
So do I.

123
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:55,103
You haven't got much chance
to be bored with me.

124
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,678
Oh, I'll never get bored with you, Irish.

125
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,647
It's been fun, every minute of it.
Such good fun.

126
00:10:02,285 --> 00:10:04,913
- I guess I'm just lucky.
- Me too.

127
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:10,223
Irish, when you go out in the rain, you'll
remember to wear your rubbers, won't you?

128
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:11,883
Sure, I will.

129
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:14,290
I'll be waiting.

130
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,025
So long, kid.

131
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:29,142
- Better stow this stuff over there, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

132
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,475
Excuse me, sir.

133
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:36,282
- Get that ladder aboard, will you, Weinberg?
- Okay.

134
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:55,699
- Hey, what's that thing for?
- You never know where your luck is.

135
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:59,466
That's from
Michael Aloysius Quincannon, Jr.

136
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,800
- Everybody in?
- Yes, sir.

137
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:03,706
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.

138
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,369
- Lockpins out?
- Yes, sir.

139
00:11:05,548 --> 00:11:08,244
- Check controls for free movement.
- Check.

140
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,315
- Roberts to flight, check-in in order.
- Two ready.

141
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,921
- Three okay.
- Four okay.

142
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:16,917
- Five okay.
- Eight ready.

143
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,493
- Nine okay.
- Okay, start engines.

144
00:11:19,662 --> 00:11:21,425
All set here, sir.

145
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:38,642
- Only need one shot, sir. Kind of warm.
- Okay.

146
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,281
Number one.

147
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:45,448
Number two.

148
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:54,829
01104 to control tower.

149
00:11:54,997 --> 00:11:58,262
Take-off instructions
for flight of nine B-17s.

150
00:11:58,434 --> 00:12:01,870
- Sir, is this a local flight?
- No, this is not a local flight.

151
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:07,071
Okay to taxi up to north end of ramp.
Use runway two-eight.

152
00:12:07,243 --> 00:12:10,576
Wind west, one-five. Go ahead.

153
00:12:10,746 --> 00:12:12,338
Roger.

154
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:15,450
Roberts to flight, all planes follow me.

155
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:19,213
Use runway 28. Wind west, 15 miles.

156
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:21,583
Take off at 30-second intervals.
Let's go.

157
00:14:14,236 --> 00:14:16,830
- Looks like they're gonna run all right.
- Thank you, sir.

158
00:14:17,006 --> 00:14:19,839
- Check the tail wheel, will you, Robbie?
- Yes, sir.

159
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,247
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, Tommy.

160
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,405
Don't get us lost.

161
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:36,688
Want any help running this thing?

162
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:41,125
- Hi, Tommy. How's Monk doing?
- Knee-deep in maps.

163
00:14:46,168 --> 00:14:48,568
Well, looks like you got your date,
all right.

164
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,137
They say that Hawaiian moon's awful big.

165
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,901
Better watch out, Tommy,
or he'll be your brother-in-law.

166
00:14:54,076 --> 00:14:57,170
No, Susan's a smart girl.
She won't marry beneath herself.

167
00:14:57,346 --> 00:14:59,678
Go on, you can't make me mad.

168
00:14:59,848 --> 00:15:01,713
Take a last look.

169
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:13,084
- Goodbye, San Francisco.
- Hello, Honolulu.

170
00:15:13,862 --> 00:15:15,887
Hey, there's the Golden Gate.

171
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,566
Christmas crackers.
That's an awful big town, San Francisco.

172
00:15:21,737 --> 00:15:23,136
Strictly a one-whistle stop.

173
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,933
There's only one city in the U.S.A.
And that's New York.

174
00:15:26,108 --> 00:15:28,668
Oh, you're just another hometown hick,
Weinberg.

175
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,438
- What's wrong with California?
- California?

176
00:15:31,614 --> 00:15:35,311
The sun shines and nothing ever happens.
Before you know it you're 60 years old.

177
00:15:35,484 --> 00:15:36,951
It's no different from New York.

178
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,883
My sister's been trying to get out
of Brooklyn for 40 years.

179
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:41,420
Brooklyn? That ain't New York.

180
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:44,423
Once you cross that Brooklyn Bridge,
you're out of this world.

181
00:15:44,593 --> 00:15:47,255
The only noise you hear
is the hardening of your arteries.

182
00:15:47,429 --> 00:15:48,794
When I used to drive a hack...

183
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:51,364
I had a pal who crossed that bridge
back in 1929.

184
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:54,195
- I ain't heard from him since.
- Me, I'll take Minneapolis.

185
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:56,895
Minneapolis?
Why, the grass still grows in the streets.

186
00:15:57,072 --> 00:15:59,233
Besides, that ain't your hometown,
Peterson.

187
00:15:59,408 --> 00:16:01,501
The hayseed's still sticking out
of your hair.

188
00:16:01,677 --> 00:16:05,443
Yeah, but I can still milk a cow.
I bet you can't.

189
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:09,907
I'll get mine out of a bottle. That's
the closest I ever wanna be to a cow.

190
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:11,643
You're handy with the old bull.

191
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,649
Gee. Gee, we're sure lucky.

192
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:19,123
- Why? What do you mean?
- Oh, this whole trip.

193
00:16:19,428 --> 00:16:20,690
Well, what about it?

194
00:16:20,863 --> 00:16:24,060
Oh, a million fellas would give anything
to be in our shoes right now.

195
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,757
Why?

196
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:28,767
I don't mean just this flight.
I mean, well...

197
00:16:28,937 --> 00:16:30,802
Everything we've got to look forward to.

198
00:16:30,973 --> 00:16:33,806
How far do you think you'll get
as an enlisted man?

199
00:16:33,976 --> 00:16:35,739
A lot of enlisted men get commissions.

200
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,311
Look at the training you get,
and the experience too.

201
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,415
Look, if you don't go through flying school,
you don't rate.

202
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,051
- I don't believe that.
- I know.

203
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:46,378
- Well, what are you in it for?
- Not for long.

204
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,682
I've had enough.
I'm getting out next month.

205
00:16:48,857 --> 00:16:50,791
- You're getting out, huh?
- Yup.

206
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,325
- Well, I'm not.
- That's right, stay with it.

207
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:57,932
You stick to what you believe in, kid.
Don't listen to guys like him.

208
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,228
What are you gonna be in another 20 years,
sergeant? A brigadier?

209
00:17:01,403 --> 00:17:04,634
No. But my boy is.

210
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:07,676
Him and me sort of like the old Air Corps.

211
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:11,713
You stay in the box, son,
and keep right on pitching.

212
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,507
Yeah.

213
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:16,810
Coming up forward, kid?

214
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,527
Yeah. Keep right on pitching.

215
00:17:41,176 --> 00:17:42,939
- Everybody all right?
- Fine, sir.

216
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:44,204
- Good.
- Coffee, captain?

217
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:46,040
Yeah, please.

218
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:52,419
- Thanks, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,923
- You want some coffee, Winocki?
- No, thanks.

220
00:18:00,095 --> 00:18:02,928
- How's it going?
- All right, sir.

221
00:18:04,199 --> 00:18:07,726
- I want to talk with you.
- Sure. Can I talk too?

222
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:10,235
Sure, go ahead. Get it off your chest.

223
00:18:10,405 --> 00:18:13,340
- I want to get things straight with you.
- I think I'm straight.

224
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:16,672
- I don't know if you are, sir.
- I think I know what's bothering you.

225
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,370
- Do you?
- Yeah. And in a way, I don't blame you.

226
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:22,244
- You wanted to fly, be a pilot, didn't you?
- Who doesn't?

227
00:18:22,417 --> 00:18:23,941
- You had your chance.
- Did I?

228
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,087
- Yeah. You blew it.
- That's what you think.

229
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:29,747
You couldn't make it. You scraped around
a while. When the going got tough...

230
00:18:29,925 --> 00:18:31,688
Yeah, and you threw me up for grabs.

231
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,761
I didn't run you into Driscoll's plane
and cut his tail off.

232
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:38,559
- Oh, I know it was an accident, but...
- For which you washed me out of school.

233
00:18:38,734 --> 00:18:42,067
I could have been flying one of these
if it hadn't been for that.

234
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:44,398
I didn't wash you out,
the board washed you out.

235
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,973
- On your recommendation.
- You lacked flying ability.

236
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:49,372
You should have been eliminated sooner.

237
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:53,304
I want you to know that nobody
held you responsible for Driscoll's death.

238
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,006
- Except you, sir.
- Not me either.

239
00:18:55,184 --> 00:18:58,051
Get that out of your head.
Now, look, Winocki...

240
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,246
there are two other men on this ship
who washed out as pilots.

241
00:19:01,423 --> 00:19:05,018
McMartin's a bombardier, Hauser went in
for navigation. They're both good.

242
00:19:05,194 --> 00:19:07,594
You're a good gunner
or you wouldn't have the rating.

243
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:09,594
We need you
like we need the whole gang.

244
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:12,325
It takes all of us
to make this ship function.

245
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:16,400
Now, get this into your head:
We all belong to this airplane.

246
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,508
Every man has got to rely on every other
man to do the right thing at the right time.

247
00:19:21,043 --> 00:19:22,533
You played football, Winocki.

248
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:25,339
You know how one man
can gum up the whole works.

249
00:19:25,514 --> 00:19:28,847
You gotta play ball with us, play the game,
or I'm gonna get rid of you.

250
00:19:29,017 --> 00:19:32,578
Nice speech.
But my enlistment runs out in three weeks.

251
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:35,853
- You're quitting, huh?
- Yes, sir.

252
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,157
Well, that's your privilege.

253
00:19:39,328 --> 00:19:42,388
But until that time, you're still in the Army.
Don't you forget it.

254
00:19:42,564 --> 00:19:46,557
- Yes, sir.
- I'm sorry for you, Winocki.

255
00:19:46,735 --> 00:19:50,796
- Anything else, sir?
- No, that's all.

256
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,008
Oh, Peterson, if you want entertainment,
tune in on the broadcast frequencies.

257
00:19:59,181 --> 00:20:02,116
- I'll stay on the command set.
- Yes, sir. Thank you.

258
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,321
San Francisco. Mr. Litvinoff, the new
Russian ambassador to the United States...

259
00:20:12,494 --> 00:20:14,485
arrived yesterday
on the China Clipper...

260
00:20:14,663 --> 00:20:18,030
and departed immediately for the capital
to confer with the president.

261
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,189
Washington, D.C.

262
00:20:19,368 --> 00:20:21,836
Tension in the Pacific and the Far East
has relaxed...

263
00:20:22,004 --> 00:20:26,441
as a result of the peaceful mission of
Japan's special envoy, Mr. Saburo Kurusu.

264
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:29,372
Mr. Kurusu and Admiral Nomura
have assured the press...

265
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:31,705
that Japan's intentions
are wholly peaceful.

266
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,974
They will meet again tomorrow
with Secretary of State Cordell Hull.

267
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,139
Seattle, Washington.

268
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:39,776
A final labor conference
was held here this morning...

269
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:56,027
Weather report from Hickam Field, sir.

270
00:21:56,198 --> 00:21:58,530
- Did you get a good sleep, Chester?
- Not much, sir.

271
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,066
I didn't wanna miss anything.

272
00:22:02,304 --> 00:22:04,772
- How's the kid doing, sergeant?
- Fine, sir.

273
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,170
He likes the ship
and I guess Mary-Ann likes him.

274
00:22:07,342 --> 00:22:09,902
Good. How about Winocki?

275
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,171
I can't make him out.

276
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:14,614
No, sir.

277
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:18,681
Thanks, Chester.

278
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:22,686
Beg pardon, sir. Isn't that
a picture of Captain Monk Hauser?

279
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,556
Yeah.

280
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,054
- Well, that's...
- My father.

281
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:31,223
Gosh, I'm pretty dumb.
I should have realized.

282
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,336
- Well, there's not much resemblance.
- Oh, sure there is. I can see it now.

283
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:38,439
I've seen him in a book I got
about the Lafayette Escadrille.

284
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,804
- Yeah, he was in it.
- Yeah, he sure was.

285
00:22:41,977 --> 00:22:45,936
- Gee, he could sure fly.
- Yeah.

286
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,909
I wish I could fly like him.

287
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,411
Yes, sir.

288
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:58,551
Well, it won't be long now
before you see Diamond Head...

289
00:22:58,727 --> 00:23:00,160
sticking out of that ocean.

290
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:01,522
Suits Weinberg.

291
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:04,096
I used to dream
about getting out of traffic jams...

292
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:06,860
and going someplace
where a guy would have elbow room.

293
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:10,266
But this is overdoing it.
Two thousand miles and I ain't seen a fish.

294
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:11,701
I kind of like it.

295
00:23:11,873 --> 00:23:15,104
- Like being on the prairies when I was a kid.
- Funny thing.

296
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:18,303
I never thought there was nothing
west of Manhattan except Jersey.

297
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,677
- I can use some of that coffee.
- I was just talking to the navigator.

298
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:24,318
- You know who his father was?
- Sure. Monk Hauser.

299
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,750
- Who's that?
- How old were you in the last war?

300
00:23:26,922 --> 00:23:28,947
Older than you.
I was over on the other side.

301
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:32,582
And you never heard of Monk Hauser
with Eddie Rickenbacker's squadron?

302
00:23:32,761 --> 00:23:36,060
Well, what do you know?
Was that Lieutenant Hauser's old man?

303
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:40,861
That's him. I knew him. He was plenty good
till they knocked him down.

304
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:42,230
Yeah, he sure was.

305
00:23:42,404 --> 00:23:45,237
- Well, why ain't this kid of his a pilot?
- Tried too hard.

306
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,102
Yeah, like a lot of others.

307
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,751
- That's funny.
- What?

308
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,752
Hickam radio went off
right in the middle of a weather report.

309
00:24:00,922 --> 00:24:04,187
- Maybe it faded out.
- It didn't sound like it.

310
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:25,940
- What is it? What is it?
- Wait.

311
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:29,576
Hey, Peterson, who you got tuned in,
Orson Welles?

312
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:30,740
- Shut up.
- Now...

313
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,352
Shut up.

314
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:39,117
Better tell the captain.

315
00:24:41,296 --> 00:24:42,888
Radio operator to pilot.

316
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,191
Radio operator to pilot.

317
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:49,330
- Go ahead.
- Sir, Hickam Field's off the air.

318
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:52,337
I don't know what I've picked up.
You can listen in on R-2.

319
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,017
- What's that?
- I don't know.

320
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,657
- Chinese?
- No, Japs.

321
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:19,861
Number four to Major Roberts.
Number four to Major Roberts.

322
00:25:20,035 --> 00:25:22,697
Stand by, Irish. I hear it.
Keep off the air.

323
00:25:23,905 --> 00:25:27,033
01104 to Hickam radio.

324
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,004
01104 to Hickam radio.

325
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:33,608
Hickam radio, answer.

326
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:36,514
Hickam radio, answer, please.

327
00:25:38,386 --> 00:25:41,617
01104 to Hickam radio.

328
00:25:43,391 --> 00:25:46,519
A flight of B- 17s to Hickam
want landing instructions.

329
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:48,920
Hickam radio, answer, please.

330
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,358
Give me landing instructions
for a flight of B- 17s.

331
00:25:54,169 --> 00:25:56,000
Hickam radio, give me a call, please.

332
00:25:57,239 --> 00:25:59,207
01104 to Hickam radio.

333
00:25:59,374 --> 00:26:02,366
Silence your radio!
Keep away from the field!

334
00:26:03,545 --> 00:26:07,174
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.
We're being attacked by enemy aircraft.

335
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,647
Land elsewhere. Land elsewhere.

336
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:10,876
Roberts to flight.

337
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:14,044
We're going into emergency fields.
You know where they are.

338
00:26:14,222 --> 00:26:17,783
I'll take the one furthest north,
number nine, furthest south...

339
00:26:17,959 --> 00:26:19,927
the rest of you, in between.

340
00:26:20,095 --> 00:26:22,495
Get on the ground
and stay there till you're clear.

341
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:23,824
You're on your own.

342
00:26:37,746 --> 00:26:41,409
Peterson, send the crew chief up here
right away.

343
00:26:41,916 --> 00:26:45,647
Get the rubber boats ready.
Pass out.45s and ammunition.

344
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,017
- Where do we go, Monk?
- Turn 120 degrees until I figure it out.

345
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:52,523
Okay, 120 degrees she is.

346
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,397
- I wish we were there.
- Yeah.

347
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,469
- If we only had machine-gun loads.
- I still got a throwing arm.

348
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:05,970
I'll heave a wrench
if any of them come our way.

349
00:27:06,141 --> 00:27:07,369
Get the rubber boats ready.

350
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,305
- Pass out side arms.
- I've done that.

351
00:27:09,477 --> 00:27:12,310
- Tell everybody to keep their eyes open.
- Yes, sir.

352
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:19,951
Put your life vests on.
Keep an eye out upstairs, kid.

353
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:24,420
- Put your life vests on, boys.
- Hey, sarge, is this really on the level?

354
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,253
You guess.

355
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,523
Winocki,
I told you to put your life vest on.

356
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:33,031
Relax, sergeant.
This is some kind of drill, and you know it.

357
00:27:33,201 --> 00:27:36,261
Personally, I wouldn't care
if you left it off. Here.

358
00:27:36,438 --> 00:27:37,735
Thanks, brigadier.

359
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:41,438
- Navigator to pilot.
- Go ahead.

360
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:45,340
Change course to 135. We ought to be
on the ground at Maui in 22 minutes.

361
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:48,112
Right, 135.

362
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:12,665
This one really is smaller
than a postage stamp.

363
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,042
Little more. That's about it.

364
00:28:57,218 --> 00:28:59,448
- Looks like it here.
- Hold it there.

365
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:02,283
- Think it'll work, sergeant?
- It'll hold all right, sir.

366
00:29:02,457 --> 00:29:06,257
- We gotta see if she'll retract.
- Because I made a mess out of the landing.

367
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:10,159
A wonder you got her in at all, sir.
This field wasn't built for the Mary-Ann.

368
00:29:11,766 --> 00:29:14,997
Hey, captain, something's moving
over there in the brush.

369
00:29:26,414 --> 00:29:28,279
Why, it's the lieutenants.

370
00:29:30,952 --> 00:29:33,182
- You fellas look like you've had a trip.
- We did.

371
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,322
- Yeah, where's the water?
- Right here.

372
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,890
- You find the other field?
- Yeah, but no ammunition.

373
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:40,584
- How many of our flight there?
- Two. Both of them okay.

374
00:29:40,762 --> 00:29:41,751
- Hi, there, Tommy.
- Hi.

375
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:43,625
- That accounts for everybody.
- Yeah.

376
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:47,199
Two more landed at Molokai,
and Roberts and the rest made Hickam.

377
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,064
- Cracked-up landing. Nobody was hurt.
- What have you heard?

378
00:29:50,238 --> 00:29:52,331
- Nothing since noon.
- Sound bad at Hickam?

379
00:29:52,507 --> 00:29:53,804
Doesn't sound good.

380
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:56,705
We had a little trouble ourselves
on the way back.

381
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,505
- What?
- Somebody took a crack at us.

382
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,011
- What do you mean?
- Just that.

383
00:30:00,181 --> 00:30:02,308
We saw men in a cane field
and headed for them.

384
00:30:02,484 --> 00:30:05,783
- They started popping away with rifles.
- Local Japs. Friendly fellas.

385
00:30:05,954 --> 00:30:07,945
We lost them back there,
three or four miles.

386
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:09,350
I hope you did.

387
00:30:09,524 --> 00:30:11,754
- Better get back to your bombsight, Tommy.
- Yeah.

388
00:30:11,926 --> 00:30:13,655
Step on it, sergeant.

389
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,828
- Douse that light! Let's get out of here!
- Knock those wedges out.

390
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,002
Winocki, cut it out.

391
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,405
Knock this one out first.

392
00:30:29,911 --> 00:30:31,538
Got this one.

393
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:34,842
- All right, shove!
- Shove.

394
00:30:35,016 --> 00:30:36,643
Everybody in the ship!

395
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:51,597
- How do we get out of this chicken yard?
- We got in, didn't we?

396
00:31:02,577 --> 00:31:05,137
Hey, they ain't kidding.

397
00:31:05,313 --> 00:31:07,781
Did you see that bumblebee?

398
00:31:20,161 --> 00:31:22,755
- Lock it.
- Locked.

399
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:50,682
Check the tanks
and see if they've been hit.

400
00:31:50,858 --> 00:31:52,257
Yes, sir.

401
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:04,162
All right, all right. Let me alone.

402
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:07,633
- All right, all right.
- How are you feeling, Winocki?

403
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:09,606
- I owe you one for this.
- Yeah?

404
00:32:10,778 --> 00:32:13,178
How far do you think you'd have gotten
in that brush?

405
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,816
They'd have cut you down
before you got to first base.

406
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:18,680
- Instead, you did it.
- Don't you know this is just a drill?

407
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,048
We could've had a fine scrap
with them snipers.

408
00:32:21,222 --> 00:32:24,282
Couple of shots in the right place
could have set this ship afire.

409
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:27,622
Use your head, Winocki,
and stop trying to prove something.

410
00:32:27,795 --> 00:32:31,287
My job is tail gunner.
What's yours, lecturing?

411
00:32:31,466 --> 00:32:35,368
No. My job is to keep this thing flying.

412
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:46,805
05564 to Hickam Field.

413
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,707
05564 to Hickam Field.

414
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,945
Shut off your radio. Stay where you are.
Don't get off the ground.

415
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:57,319
05564 to Hickam.
Just cleared emergency field on Maui.

416
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,687
- Have to come down.
- Okay.

417
00:32:59,861 --> 00:33:03,126
- Give me a call just before you come in.
- Roger.

418
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,152
Pilot to crew.

419
00:33:32,326 --> 00:33:34,226
Take a good look at Pearl Harbor.

420
00:33:34,395 --> 00:33:36,420
Maybe it's something
you'll want to remember.

421
00:33:44,872 --> 00:33:47,864
Damn them. Damn them.

422
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,645
Now ain't you glad
you're getting out of the Army?

423
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:25,443
05564 to Hickam.

424
00:34:25,613 --> 00:34:27,877
- Go ahead.
- Approaching the field from the south.

425
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:31,109
- Coming in for a landing.
- We won't be able to give you any lights.

426
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:34,379
- I can get in without them.
- Take the west side near the hangars.

427
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:36,989
Watch out for bomb craters
on the runway.

428
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,956
- Good luck to you.
- Roger.

429
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:42,893
Pilot to crew. Fasten your safety belts.

430
00:34:43,064 --> 00:34:45,157
- Might be a rough landing.
- All set, sir.

431
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,324
All checked for landing.

432
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:52,098
- Give me full flaps.
- Flaps coming down.

433
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,677
- Landing lights.
- Lights.

434
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,709
Air speed 110.

435
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:03,942
One hundred.

436
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:45,917
- Captain Quincannon, sir.
- How are you, captain?

437
00:36:46,087 --> 00:36:48,920
You made a good landing.
You were told to stay where you were.

438
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,614
- Yes, but we had to get out.
- Why?

439
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,782
- We were being shot at by snipers.
- At Maui?

440
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,020
- We didn't wanna lose the airplane.
- No, no, of course you didn't.

441
00:36:56,197 --> 00:36:58,825
Didn't know about that.
You did the right thing, then.

442
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,698
Well, we've had our troubles around here
too, as you can see.

443
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,403
Yes, sir.
They certainly did a complete job of it.

444
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:08,872
What happened to those P-40s?

445
00:37:09,043 --> 00:37:11,534
Three trucks arrived from Honolulu
this morning.

446
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:14,909
When the first Jap plane showed up,
the trucks went down the field...

447
00:37:15,082 --> 00:37:17,312
smashed the tails off every ship
on the land.

448
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,818
They sure had a field day.
Took the first round, but there'll be others.

449
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,979
- Yes, sir.
- Which one of you is McMartin?

450
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,250
- Me, sir.
- I have some bad news for you.

451
00:37:25,426 --> 00:37:27,792
- You're wanted over at the hospital.
- My sister?

452
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:31,989
Sorry, I didn't get any details except that
she asked for Williams and Quincannon too.

453
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,430
Captain, we'll want your ship serviced
right away.

454
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,729
- Full gas load, ammunition for guns.
- Yes, sir.

455
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:37,893
Any repairs needed?

456
00:37:38,072 --> 00:37:40,734
There's a wheel to be checked.
Everything else seems okay.

457
00:37:40,908 --> 00:37:42,500
These men will give you everything.

458
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,701
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir?

459
00:37:43,878 --> 00:37:46,005
You heard what the colonel said.
Anything else?

460
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,580
- This car will take you to the hospital.
- Thank you.

461
00:37:48,749 --> 00:37:50,444
- Who's your navigator?
- I am, sir.

462
00:37:50,618 --> 00:37:52,882
- Come with me. I have a job for you.
- Oh, colonel.

463
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,578
Beg your pardon, sir.

464
00:37:54,755 --> 00:37:57,121
- Glad to see you again, sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

465
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,192
Did they attack Clark Field, Manila, sir?

466
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:03,057
- I've got a boy there.
- Yes, they hit it all right.

467
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:06,529
Hit everything in the Pacific.
Guam, Wake, Midway.

468
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,669
I remember your boy, sergeant.

469
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:10,861
- Twenty-seventh group.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:13,199
He's a first lieutenant now.
Flight commander.

471
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:16,434
He's a good pilot, then.
Don't worry. He'll take care of himself.

472
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:18,840
Thank you, sir. All right, fellas.

473
00:38:19,013 --> 00:38:22,414
We got a job of work to do.
Let's get with it.

474
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,316
- Miss McMartin?
- Right down that way.

475
00:38:27,488 --> 00:38:29,080
Thank you.

476
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,552
I can't see. Why is it so dark?

477
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,254
Hush, child. It's going to be all right.

478
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,898
But I can't see.

479
00:38:40,034 --> 00:38:41,023
I can't see.

480
00:38:41,202 --> 00:38:42,965
- Lieutenant McMartin?
- Yes, nurse.

481
00:38:43,137 --> 00:38:46,265
You can only stay a few minutes.
She needs all the rest she can get.

482
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,805
Sure.

483
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:01,252
Sue.

484
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:04,156
Hello, kids.

485
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:09,259
Why, it's good to see you boys.

486
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:13,399
I was kind of scared.

487
00:39:13,734 --> 00:39:15,861
I acted like a ninny.

488
00:39:16,037 --> 00:39:19,871
We didn't know whether you had
a flat tire or something...

489
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:23,866
or couldn't find the place.

490
00:39:25,746 --> 00:39:27,179
Or...

491
00:39:27,348 --> 00:39:30,715
Tommy, Bill, I'm so glad you're here.

492
00:39:32,053 --> 00:39:35,989
- Kind of hurts when I cry.
- Don't, Sue.

493
00:39:38,392 --> 00:39:41,327
I wanted to tell you about...

494
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,631
But I guess I'm kind of tired.

495
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,633
- He'll tell you.
- Who?

496
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,396
Tex.

497
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:53,865
- Tex Rader.
- What?

498
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:57,204
Please don't get mad at him.
It was all my fault.

499
00:39:57,611 --> 00:40:00,705
He tried to make me
get out of the car, but...

500
00:40:03,918 --> 00:40:07,081
- I guess he'd better tell you.
- Sure.

501
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:12,823
- Will you come in the morning?
- You bet.

502
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:15,620
Good night.

503
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:26,832
Sergeant, do you know
where we can find Lieutenant Rader?

504
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:28,804
Yes, sir. Right this way.

505
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,787
Rader. Rader.

506
00:40:47,828 --> 00:40:49,420
Oh, hello, Tommy.

507
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:53,089
- Quincannon. How are you, Bill?
- I've been waiting for you. I went to sleep.

508
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:54,700
We just came from the hospital.

509
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,063
- How is she?
- Not so good.

510
00:40:56,237 --> 00:40:58,102
That's what we came
to talk to you about.

511
00:40:58,272 --> 00:41:00,866
- Suppose you do a little explaining.
- Yeah, go on, start.

512
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:04,807
- Say, what is this, the third degree?
- All right, she said it wasn't his fault.

513
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:07,004
Don't believe what she said.
It was my fault.

514
00:41:07,181 --> 00:41:09,445
- Should've made her get out of the car.
- What car?

515
00:41:09,617 --> 00:41:11,744
- The one I borrowed for the party.
- What party?

516
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:13,614
Give him a chance.

517
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,948
We were starting out
when the first planes came.

518
00:41:16,123 --> 00:41:18,284
- Couldn't figure it out.
- Up early, weren't you?

519
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,926
- Or out late.
- Listen, will you?

520
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:22,562
- Say, I don't get...
- Never mind, Rader. Go ahead.

521
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:26,091
We spotted the planes, and
at the same time heard the bombs.

522
00:41:26,267 --> 00:41:28,360
All I could think of
was getting to the field.

523
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:31,869
I told Susan to hop out and get under cover,
but she only laughed at me.

524
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,166
- You know how she is.
- Yeah, we know. Go on.

525
00:41:34,341 --> 00:41:37,936
We got near the field, a truck pulled
across, blocking the road ahead of us.

526
00:41:38,112 --> 00:41:39,875
It was a delivery truck from Honolulu.

527
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:43,107
I remember thinking as I jumped out
that the driver had been hit.

528
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:44,376
I was just dumb.

529
00:41:44,552 --> 00:41:47,521
First thing I knew,
there was an explosion right in my face.

530
00:41:47,688 --> 00:41:49,849
There was a Jap behind the wheel
with a shotgun.

531
00:41:50,024 --> 00:41:53,050
It was a rotten shot. Sloughed him
over the head with his own gun.

532
00:41:53,227 --> 00:41:54,455
Got the truck off the road.

533
00:41:54,628 --> 00:41:57,222
Other cars were coming along,
trying to get to the field.

534
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:58,729
Was Susan all right then?

535
00:41:58,899 --> 00:42:01,231
Yeah, but that's when
I should've made her get out.

536
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:05,862
She took the wheel and went carting off
toward the hangars with me hanging on.

537
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,508
Last time I saw her,
she was standing up in the car...

538
00:42:08,676 --> 00:42:11,201
yelling and rooting
like she was at a football game.

539
00:42:11,378 --> 00:42:14,074
- How'd she get hurt, then?
- Machine gun.

540
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,546
The soldier who ran out
to drag her in was killed.

541
00:42:16,717 --> 00:42:19,447
- What were you doing all that time?
- What do you think?

542
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,815
I notice you're not hurt any.

543
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:24,215
- Listen, wait a minute.
- Wait a minute, Tommy.

544
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:26,757
If I stay here, I'll...
Let's go.

545
00:42:26,927 --> 00:42:29,361
- Say, you guys don't think...?
- See you later, Rader.

546
00:42:47,248 --> 00:42:49,148
You wanted to see me, colonel?

547
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,783
- You find something to eat?
- Yes.

548
00:42:50,951 --> 00:42:53,146
- How's your sister, McMartin?
- Pretty weak, sir.

549
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,117
The surgeon says it's hard to tell yet.

550
00:42:55,289 --> 00:42:57,814
I'm going over again
when he makes another examination.

551
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:00,961
No, you aren't. We want this airplane
out of here before daylight.

552
00:43:01,128 --> 00:43:03,596
- You're sending us back to the mainland?
- No, Manila.

553
00:43:03,764 --> 00:43:06,961
We're safe here for the moment,
and the Philippines are in bad shape.

554
00:43:07,134 --> 00:43:10,467
Our orders are to send them as many B-17s
as we can. Can you make it?

555
00:43:10,638 --> 00:43:13,539
- Where do we stop to refuel, sir?
- Wake Island.

556
00:43:13,707 --> 00:43:17,040
I can't promise you how long it'll hold out
or what you'll find there.

557
00:43:17,211 --> 00:43:18,974
- Got the charts there, Monk?
- Yes, sir.

558
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:20,545
- Sergeant White.
- Yes, sir?

559
00:43:20,714 --> 00:43:24,616
- How'd the engines rev up, sergeant?
- Number-three engine's a little rough, sir.

560
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:27,481
The men are pretty tired.
We'll overhaul it in the morning.

561
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,316
- We're taking off in two hours.
- Sir?

562
00:43:29,490 --> 00:43:32,050
I think you're gonna see
that son of yours soon.

563
00:43:32,226 --> 00:43:34,126
- Manila?
- Can you get that engine running?

564
00:43:34,295 --> 00:43:36,422
We'll have her hitting home runs
in 90 minutes.

565
00:43:36,597 --> 00:43:39,327
Tell the crew they can sleep
in the next world.

566
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:42,697
- We'll make it all right, sir.
- Good luck. Take off when you're ready.

567
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,703
By the way, tell your passenger
I'll have some papers for him.

568
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,205
- What passenger, sir?
- Hasn't he reported yet?

569
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:50,866
- Manila needs pilots. You're taking one.
- Who, sir?

570
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,808
Lieutenant Rader.

571
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,244
- Did you say Rader?
- Yes, and he's a good man too.

572
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,317
Three fighters got off the ground
this morning, and he was one.

573
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:01,045
Knocked off four Jap Zeros
before they shot him down.

574
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,985
He'll be recommended for a DFC.
Well, good luck again.

575
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:05,648
Thank you, sir.

576
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,627
Well...

577
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,295
looks like you two fellas
talked out of turn a while ago.

578
00:44:13,467 --> 00:44:16,300
Maybe you better go
and rustle up some grub for the crew.

579
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,165
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

580
00:45:02,249 --> 00:45:04,376
- Java, lieutenant?
- No, I've been living on it.

581
00:45:04,551 --> 00:45:06,815
You fellas must have a plantation
in Brazil.

582
00:45:06,987 --> 00:45:09,785
I'll leave it here.
Maybe you'll want some later on.

583
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,754
- Is this here Wake Island?
- Yeah.

584
00:45:11,925 --> 00:45:14,917
- How far is it?
- Oh, it's about 2300 miles from Honolulu.

585
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,224
- And we're gonna land on that dot?
- Yeah. It's not very big, is it?

586
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:22,233
Like trying to find a buckshot
in Central Park.

587
00:45:22,403 --> 00:45:24,633
Gee, I wish there were
some traffic signs around.

588
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,002
- There are, but you can't see them.
- I mean like numbers and streets.

589
00:45:28,175 --> 00:45:30,473
Yeah, but I call them latitudes
and longitudes.

590
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,910
- And they're just like signs, huh?
- Yeah, if the wind doesn't change them.

591
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:39,148
Say, lieutenant, how we doing?

592
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,652
Now, look, you're the fifth guy
that's been down here asking that.

593
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:44,848
- We'll hit Wake all right.
- Yes, sir.

594
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:47,323
I was just asking.

595
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,734
- Time to relieve the kid, Minnesota.
- Okay.

596
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:05,309
You want anything, lieutenant?

597
00:46:05,479 --> 00:46:07,970
Yeah, I'd like to get out
of this flying boxcar.

598
00:46:08,148 --> 00:46:09,445
Sure a long way to Manila.

599
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:12,551
Mary-Ann ain't no boxcar, sir.
She's a good airplane.

600
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:14,346
- Mary-Ann?
- That's what we call her.

601
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:16,489
There ain't a better airplane in the Army.

602
00:46:16,657 --> 00:46:19,421
- Maybe, if you're talking about bombers.
- Any airplane, sir.

603
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:24,155
- I'll take a pursuit ship for mine, sergeant.
- Well, you can take pursuit and...

604
00:46:24,731 --> 00:46:26,198
Yes, sir.

605
00:46:33,407 --> 00:46:35,932
Oh, chief, that's my last apple.
I'm saving it.

606
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:40,478
Don't leave it laying around, then.
There's a pursuit pilot back there.

607
00:46:55,996 --> 00:46:58,226
Morning, sir. How we doing?

608
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:01,993
You too? Every 15 minutes, somebody
wakes up and comes here to find out...

609
00:47:02,169 --> 00:47:06,105
if I know where we are or if I'm gonna
get this airplane lost. I'm getting sick...

610
00:47:06,707 --> 00:47:08,937
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, I'm sorry, sergeant.

611
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:12,306
- I guess I'm a little on edge.
- Oh, that's all right, sir.

612
00:47:12,479 --> 00:47:14,709
That's the way
your old man would've told me off.

613
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:17,146
Except he'd have done it
with a four-star cussing.

614
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:21,754
- Yeah, I guess he would.
- Tell me, sir, how are we doing?

615
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,857
We're all right. I think we're gonna
hit Wake right on the nose.

616
00:47:25,025 --> 00:47:26,993
Sure we will, sir.

617
00:47:38,338 --> 00:47:42,638
Say, chief, what happens if the Japs
have took Wake Island before we get there?

618
00:47:42,809 --> 00:47:45,573
I wish you'd learn
to control that imagination of yours.

619
00:47:45,746 --> 00:47:48,146
- I was just asking.
- Don't you know we're not at war?

620
00:47:48,315 --> 00:47:50,749
- Ain't we in the war yet?
- Hasn't been declared.

621
00:47:50,918 --> 00:47:53,250
- I don't get it.
- Them Japs.

622
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,049
They smear Pearl Harbor, smack Manila,
raid Wake, Guam and Midway...

623
00:47:57,224 --> 00:47:58,691
and still there ain't no war.

624
00:47:58,859 --> 00:48:01,157
They send a couple of oily gents
to Washington...

625
00:48:01,328 --> 00:48:03,319
with a olive wreath for the president...

626
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:07,160
while the boys back home slough
Uncle Sam over the head with a crowbar.

627
00:48:07,334 --> 00:48:09,666
Your Uncle Sam
is a pretty tough old gentleman.

628
00:48:09,836 --> 00:48:11,269
You just wait till he gets mad.

629
00:48:11,438 --> 00:48:14,373
I hope you don't mind
if I get slightly annoyed in the meantime.

630
00:48:14,541 --> 00:48:18,944
- No. But I didn't expect it of you.
- I still don't get it.

631
00:48:21,949 --> 00:48:25,350
Message coming through, sir.
And good news.

632
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,190
Thanks, Peterson.

633
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:38,293
Hey, you guys, take a look at this.

634
00:48:44,241 --> 00:48:45,230
That's wonderful.

635
00:48:45,409 --> 00:48:47,570
If the head surgeon says that,
she must be okay.

636
00:48:47,744 --> 00:48:49,575
- Sure she is.
- Boy, I feel a lot better.

637
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:51,111
Oh, me too.

638
00:48:51,281 --> 00:48:53,875
It was mighty swell of the CO
to think of sending this.

639
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:56,747
Better show it to our passenger.
Poor guy must be worrying.

640
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:00,412
- Let him worry. He's got it coming.
- You're being a little tough with Rader.

641
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:04,651
- I haven't kicked him in the face yet.
- You couldn't be jealous, could you, Bill?

642
00:49:04,828 --> 00:49:07,729
Well, maybe I am.

643
00:49:09,433 --> 00:49:12,095
Peterson, ask Lieutenant Rader
to come up front, will you?

644
00:49:12,269 --> 00:49:14,999
That's the stuff.
Now, look, stay out of arguments.

645
00:49:15,172 --> 00:49:16,969
- We never...
- You can't outtalk that guy.

646
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:20,837
He's been shooting off his face against
big airplanes since they gave him wings.

647
00:49:21,011 --> 00:49:23,275
But he doesn't know any better.
Just quit arguing.

648
00:49:23,447 --> 00:49:26,939
- You'll be a lot better off.
- Okay, captain.

649
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:29,210
- Somebody up here wanna see me?
- Yeah.

650
00:49:29,386 --> 00:49:32,321
- We got some good news for you, Tex.
- Yeah?

651
00:49:34,658 --> 00:49:36,990
Boy, that is good news.

652
00:49:37,961 --> 00:49:39,451
She's a swell kid.

653
00:49:39,629 --> 00:49:42,325
You know, Tex,
we were all pretty upset last night.

654
00:49:42,499 --> 00:49:44,865
If we said anything out of line...

655
00:49:45,035 --> 00:49:47,503
Oh, forget it, I know how you felt.
I don't blame you.

656
00:49:47,671 --> 00:49:51,232
Thanks, Tex. After all,
we've known each other a long time.

657
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:54,866
We've had our arguments about these
big bombers and your Peashooters, but...

658
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:57,013
Forget it, Tommy.
Just a matter of opinion.

659
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,742
You know, Tex, we were wondering,
what was it like yesterday at Hickam?

660
00:50:01,918 --> 00:50:05,581
- Oh, an awful mess. We just weren't ready.
- How good are those Japs?

661
00:50:05,755 --> 00:50:08,553
They're pretty good
when they got the edge, 10 or 12 to one.

662
00:50:08,725 --> 00:50:10,215
They don't like an even fight.

663
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:14,591
Every time you get one alone,
he lights out like a scared sage hen.

664
00:50:15,031 --> 00:50:17,591
- We heard you did a swell job.
- Thanks.

665
00:50:17,767 --> 00:50:19,029
Hope you get a decoration.

666
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:21,727
I'd still like to know
how all their carriers got away.

667
00:50:21,905 --> 00:50:23,372
We didn't even get a bomber off.

668
00:50:23,540 --> 00:50:26,805
- Caught them on the ground.
- You make it sound like the bombers' fault.

669
00:50:26,977 --> 00:50:28,808
Okay, you two, quit it.

670
00:50:28,979 --> 00:50:31,004
You guys are awful touchy
about these crates.

671
00:50:31,181 --> 00:50:32,842
- Oh, it's not that...
- Hold it.

672
00:50:33,016 --> 00:50:35,075
- Go ahead, Monk.
- The wind shifted again.

673
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:38,085
Give me three degrees to the left.
You'd better make it 2.44.

674
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:40,519
Okay, two-four-four.

675
00:50:41,591 --> 00:50:44,116
- That's the new flight control?
- You know the old type?

676
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:46,558
- Yeah.
- Well, this is a whole lot better.

677
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:49,255
Why don't you fly her
and find out what a B-17 will do?

678
00:50:49,432 --> 00:50:52,401
Oh, no, not me. Looks to me
like she's flying herself anyway.

679
00:50:52,569 --> 00:50:54,002
Well, she is right now, yeah.

680
00:50:54,171 --> 00:50:56,731
She seems to be getting us there,
not very fast though.

681
00:50:56,907 --> 00:50:58,841
She'll out-fly your pursuit ships
up high.

682
00:50:59,009 --> 00:51:00,374
- Will she?
- Yeah, she will.

683
00:51:00,544 --> 00:51:02,774
- You can't sell me.
- What'll a P-40 do at 30,000?

684
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:06,279
- We'd have to tow it to get it up there.
- We'd run away and hide on you.

685
00:51:06,449 --> 00:51:09,509
- Well, that's all you could do.
- Oh, sure, no arguments.

686
00:51:09,686 --> 00:51:12,246
If you guys will give me a chance,
I'll prove something.

687
00:51:12,422 --> 00:51:15,323
- All right, go ahead.
- Three minutes and no interruptions.

688
00:51:15,492 --> 00:51:17,517
- Anything to get this settled.
- Let him talk.

689
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:19,491
Irish, the navigator gave you a course.

690
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,461
You reach down and turn a knob
and you're on it, right?

691
00:51:22,632 --> 00:51:25,897
Tommy, that gadget there is almost as good
as your bombsight, isn't it?

692
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:27,559
- Well, not quite...
- Well, almost.

693
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:30,228
- And you call the sight the brain, don't you?
- Yeah.

694
00:51:30,407 --> 00:51:33,968
- Then this is a sort of mechanical brain too.
- It does everything but think.

695
00:51:34,144 --> 00:51:36,237
It seems to be doing the thinking
right now.

696
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:38,040
- Well, I don't...
- Watch out for him.

697
00:51:38,215 --> 00:51:40,183
- Did you hear about it too?
- Hear what?

698
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,817
- I got it pretty straight.
- What?

699
00:51:41,985 --> 00:51:45,421
Why, they're gonna give commissions
to these mechanical brains in bombers.

700
00:51:45,589 --> 00:51:49,787
Put them in uniform and teach them to talk,
turn out bomber pilots on the assembly line.

701
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,951
We pursuit pilots
will be upstairs fighting.

702
00:51:52,128 --> 00:51:55,154
We'll look down and see
a flock of these freight trains coming.

703
00:51:55,332 --> 00:51:57,994
Press a button: "Lieutenant."
"Yes, sir?" says that thing.

704
00:51:58,168 --> 00:52:01,968
"Drop a load of potatoes on the enemy."
"I'll tell Captain Bombsight right away."

705
00:52:02,138 --> 00:52:04,902
"Very well. Where's your pilot?"
"We left him on the ground.

706
00:52:05,075 --> 00:52:07,635
We don't need them.
Their heads take up too much room."

707
00:52:07,811 --> 00:52:09,438
- Very funny.
- Did you ever think...?

708
00:52:09,613 --> 00:52:12,605
- Keep them quiet, Irish.
- Shut up, you guys. Give him a chance.

709
00:52:12,782 --> 00:52:15,182
Now, seriously, guys,
these big crates are all right.

710
00:52:15,352 --> 00:52:18,844
I just don't wanna fight in any airplane
that more than one man can ride in.

711
00:52:19,022 --> 00:52:21,286
I don't wanna be responsible
for eight or 10 guys.

712
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,858
Or depending on them,
the way you're on Hauser now.

713
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:26,461
What do you mean, depending on him?

714
00:52:26,630 --> 00:52:29,690
In a pursuit ship, you're a one-man army,
not a taxi driver.

715
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:30,958
You're on your own.

716
00:52:31,134 --> 00:52:34,103
You don't wait for orders
from a guy who can't fly, a bombardier.

717
00:52:34,271 --> 00:52:35,465
Hey, that's enough.

718
00:52:35,639 --> 00:52:38,472
You give orders to these taxi drivers
when you go to lay eggs.

719
00:52:38,642 --> 00:52:40,007
"Where to?" says the Irishman.

720
00:52:40,176 --> 00:52:43,942
You say, "Go a few blocks and turn right.
Give me change for a nickel, conductor."

721
00:52:44,114 --> 00:52:47,379
When you get to 33rd and Broadway,
throw an egg out the window and run.

722
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,350
Very exciting. I wouldn't fly this crate
if they made me a brigadier for it.

723
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:54,251
Bill, pipe down. Shut up, Rader.
Go ahead, Peterson.

724
00:52:54,424 --> 00:52:56,654
I've picked up Washington
on the short wave, sir.

725
00:52:56,826 --> 00:52:58,418
- The president's on.
- Thanks.

726
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:01,496
Washington's on short wave.
Get below and grab some headphones.

727
00:53:01,665 --> 00:53:03,633
Yeah, and take that
pursuit pilot with you.

728
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,665
- Do I have to?
- Take him.

729
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:09,498
- Come on, lone eagle.
- Drop him out if you get a chance.

730
00:53:12,676 --> 00:53:15,144
The attack yesterday...

731
00:53:15,545 --> 00:53:17,410
on the Hawaiian Islands...

732
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:24,076
has caused severe damage
to American naval and military forces.

733
00:53:25,322 --> 00:53:31,522
I regret to tell you that
very many American lives have been lost.

734
00:53:31,695 --> 00:53:35,859
But always will our whole nation...

735
00:53:36,032 --> 00:53:42,028
remember the character
of the onslaught against us.

736
00:53:43,006 --> 00:53:45,941
I hope he tells us something
about the Philippines.

737
00:53:46,109 --> 00:53:47,542
My boy's at Clark Field.

738
00:53:50,947 --> 00:53:53,472
No matter how long it may take us...

739
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:58,720
to overcome
this premeditated invasion...

740
00:53:58,888 --> 00:54:02,051
the American people,
in their righteous might...

741
00:54:02,225 --> 00:54:05,786
will win through to absolute victory.

742
00:54:12,902 --> 00:54:17,464
We will not only defend ourselves
to the uttermost...

743
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,666
but will make it very certain...

744
00:54:20,844 --> 00:54:27,340
that this form of treachery
shall never again endanger us.

745
00:54:27,517 --> 00:54:31,283
With confidence in our armed forces...

746
00:54:31,855 --> 00:54:37,054
with the unbounding determination
of our people...

747
00:54:37,227 --> 00:54:41,323
we will gain the inevitable triumph...

748
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:43,728
so help us God.

749
00:54:44,434 --> 00:54:49,201
I ask that the Congress declare...

750
00:54:49,372 --> 00:54:52,398
a state of war.

751
00:55:37,487 --> 00:55:39,887
Pick up anything from Wake Island?

752
00:55:52,869 --> 00:55:54,928
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.

753
00:55:55,104 --> 00:55:57,231
- What do you think, Monk?
- I don't know, Irish.

754
00:55:57,407 --> 00:56:00,501
We ought to be there now.
Go another 10 minutes, then turn east.

755
00:56:00,677 --> 00:56:02,611
Okay.

756
00:56:31,174 --> 00:56:34,143
- There she is, Irish, dead ahead.
- Good guessing, Monk.

757
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,438
- Oh, shut up, will you?
- Magellan!

758
00:56:37,847 --> 00:56:40,475
Pilot to crew. Wake Island, dead ahead.

759
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:44,882
- Hey, Wake Island in sight.
- Boy, what a navigator.

760
00:57:51,854 --> 00:57:54,687
- There's nothing here but Marines.
- What'd you expect to see?

761
00:57:54,857 --> 00:57:56,825
- Where'd you guys come from?
- Hickam Field.

762
00:57:56,993 --> 00:57:58,756
- Any more coming?
- I don't know.

763
00:57:58,928 --> 00:58:00,395
- Where are you going?
- Manila.

764
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:02,827
Gangway, men. Coming in.

765
00:58:05,802 --> 00:58:07,929
Good work, captain.
Major Daniels, commanding.

766
00:58:08,104 --> 00:58:09,332
Quincannon. Thank you, sir.

767
00:58:09,505 --> 00:58:12,804
These are Lieutenants Williams,
McMartin and Rader.

768
00:58:12,976 --> 00:58:15,001
And this is Lieutenant Hauser,
our navigator.

769
00:58:15,178 --> 00:58:17,339
We're gonna put him
in a glass case in a museum.

770
00:58:17,513 --> 00:58:20,710
- Did a good job, Hauser.
- The island looked pretty good to me, sir.

771
00:58:20,883 --> 00:58:22,817
- Me too.
- Yes, I guess it did at that.

772
00:58:22,986 --> 00:58:26,183
- Looks better than anytime since Monday.
- You mean Sunday, don't you?

773
00:58:26,356 --> 00:58:29,325
Monday here was Sunday in Honolulu.
You've crossed the date line.

774
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:32,290
He's a pursuit pilot, major.
They don't get around very much.

775
00:58:32,462 --> 00:58:34,953
Could we bunk down
for five or six hours, sir?

776
00:58:35,131 --> 00:58:36,359
We haven't had much sleep.

777
00:58:36,532 --> 00:58:39,000
In six hours, you better be
five and a half hours out.

778
00:58:39,168 --> 00:58:42,228
With the beacons, Japs don't have
to wait till daylight to call.

779
00:58:42,405 --> 00:58:45,340
- My orders are to get you out in 20 minutes.
- Twenty minutes?

780
00:58:45,508 --> 00:58:47,032
That's right.

781
00:58:48,077 --> 00:58:51,308
- What do you say, sergeant?
- Well, we're halfway to Manila now, sir.

782
00:58:51,481 --> 00:58:54,143
Don't see any reason
we can't make it the rest of the way.

783
00:58:54,317 --> 00:58:57,013
- Could use some help.
- Take all the men you need, sergeant.

784
00:58:57,186 --> 00:58:58,175
All right.

785
00:58:58,354 --> 00:59:01,687
You first five men come with me.
Get the cowling off number 3 engine.

786
00:59:01,858 --> 00:59:04,793
Quincannon, our commander,
Major Bagley, wants to talk to you.

787
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,121
Yes, sir.

788
00:59:16,139 --> 00:59:18,300
- So they really got the Arizona?
- Yes, sir.

789
00:59:18,474 --> 00:59:20,874
Hickam Field was hit
just as bad as Pearl Harbor.

790
00:59:21,044 --> 00:59:22,272
A lot of fifth column work.

791
00:59:22,445 --> 00:59:24,572
We got practically nothing
off the ground, sir.

792
00:59:24,747 --> 00:59:27,215
I've studied all the wars of history,
gentlemen.

793
00:59:27,383 --> 00:59:30,443
I've never come across
any dirty treachery like that.

794
00:59:30,620 --> 00:59:32,349
How many airplanes have you got, sir?

795
00:59:32,522 --> 00:59:34,547
A week ago, we didn't have any.

796
00:59:34,724 --> 00:59:37,750
A few days ago, they flew in 12 fighters
from one of the carriers.

797
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:40,361
Eight were destroyed
after they came in from patrol.

798
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,225
Only four left, sir?

799
00:59:42,398 --> 00:59:45,856
Only two. And one of those can't fly.

800
00:59:46,035 --> 00:59:49,300
But those four Grummans
took on 60 Nips this afternoon.

801
00:59:49,472 --> 00:59:51,872
Shot down plenty of them too.

802
00:59:52,709 --> 00:59:54,108
Hogan and Ingersol got theirs.

803
00:59:55,078 --> 00:59:56,306
I think you knew them.

804
00:59:56,479 --> 00:59:57,707
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I did.

805
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,340
I suppose the Japs will be back, major.
What are you gonna do then?

806
01:00:02,518 --> 01:00:06,921
We got a lad catching a few winks of sleep
that will take them all on single-handed.

807
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:09,149
- Lieutenant Rose.
- Bertie Rose?

808
01:00:09,325 --> 01:00:11,520
- That's him.
- You guys remember Rose, don't you?

809
01:00:11,694 --> 01:00:13,958
- Sure.
- Everybody kidded him about his size.

810
01:00:14,130 --> 01:00:16,724
- Little bitty squirt about that high.
- Sure, we knew him.

811
01:00:16,899 --> 01:00:18,696
I'd like to stand up and salute him.

812
01:00:18,968 --> 01:00:20,833
Could we talk to him before we take off?

813
01:00:21,003 --> 01:00:23,437
I'll tell him you wanted to see him.
He needs rest.

814
01:00:23,606 --> 01:00:25,369
We have to roust him out any minute...

815
01:00:25,541 --> 01:00:28,533
and he hasn't had
much of a chance to sleep lately.

816
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:31,176
- Ship's ready, sir.
- All right, sergeant.

817
01:00:31,347 --> 01:00:34,282
And good luck to you.
It's been nice seeing you boys.

818
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,315
Go out and blast the Japs.

819
01:00:36,486 --> 01:00:40,081
Teach them that treachery can't win
no matter how much of a head start it has.

820
01:00:40,256 --> 01:00:44,283
You young fellows will have to do that.
We're only fighting a delaying action here.

821
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:45,722
You can't hold out, sir?

822
01:00:45,895 --> 01:00:48,193
I've got 400 Marines
and they're fighting mad.

823
01:00:48,364 --> 01:00:52,892
There's gonna be some Jap tail feathers
flying around this island or I'm crazy.

824
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:56,698
Major Bagley, can't we fly you out, sir?
You and the rest of the wounded?

825
01:00:56,873 --> 01:00:58,465
No, thanks, I'm fine here.

826
01:00:58,641 --> 01:01:01,974
I'm not worth my weight in gasoline.
Me or anybody else.

827
01:01:02,145 --> 01:01:05,376
They need that ship of yours in Manila.
Get it there.

828
01:01:05,548 --> 01:01:07,675
- Yes, sir.
- Oh, by the way...

829
01:01:07,850 --> 01:01:10,410
if you see my old boss,
General MacArthur...

830
01:01:10,586 --> 01:01:12,554
tell him, no matter what the news is...

831
01:01:12,722 --> 01:01:15,122
we'll be in here pitching
till they strike us out.

832
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:16,519
All right, sir, we will.

833
01:01:16,692 --> 01:01:18,922
- I'll see you all somewhere.
- So long.

834
01:01:19,095 --> 01:01:21,393
- Best of luck to you.
- Thanks.

835
01:01:29,172 --> 01:01:32,573
- You think we ought to take him with us?
- He wouldn't leave this island...

836
01:01:32,742 --> 01:01:35,370
if you got him a lower berth
in a Pullman.

837
01:01:35,645 --> 01:01:37,909
- There you go.
- One for the wife, one for the kid.

838
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:40,412
He'll be old enough to read
by the time I get back.

839
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:42,380
- Don't lose them, soldier.
- Don't worry.

840
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:44,713
I was gonna leave a letter here
for the Clipper.

841
01:01:44,887 --> 01:01:47,412
She got away yesterday.
Twenty-six bullet holes in her.

842
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,185
- Crew so mad they wanted to stay and fight.
- The old man got tough with them.

843
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:53,351
- Take care of this one.
- This one too.

844
01:01:53,529 --> 01:01:55,497
Come on.
We don't want Tripoli to get hurt.

845
01:01:55,665 --> 01:01:58,998
- Gave him the rank of top sergeant.
- No pedigree, but he sure can fight.

846
01:01:59,168 --> 01:02:01,568
- He'd tackle a Jap three times his size.
- Anything.

847
01:02:01,737 --> 01:02:03,898
No, I wish I could,
but I'd get in an awful jam.

848
01:02:04,073 --> 01:02:07,008
Give him to the Marines in Manila.
We gotta get him out of here.

849
01:02:07,176 --> 01:02:09,667
- Come on, soldier.
- It's against regulations, pal.

850
01:02:09,846 --> 01:02:12,076
- I can't take that dog onboard with me.
- You can.

851
01:02:12,248 --> 01:02:13,943
- Wanna get me busted?
- You're not...

852
01:02:14,116 --> 01:02:17,711
He's trained too. Look.
Tripoli, do you like Mr. Moto?

853
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:21,312
- See?
- Ain't that cute, Winocki?

854
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,287
- He's smart.
- What do you say, Brooklyn?

855
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:25,051
- Come on, soldier.
- Give him a kiss.

856
01:02:25,228 --> 01:02:27,196
Gee, I'd like to, honest, but...

857
01:02:28,631 --> 01:02:30,394
Gee, here goes my promotion.

858
01:02:30,766 --> 01:02:33,894
- That's a good fellow.
- Duck. Here they come.

859
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:39,472
- Well, goodbye, sir. And luck.
- Same to you, boys.

860
01:02:39,642 --> 01:02:42,770
- Anything we can do for you in Manila?
- You might send us more Japs.

861
01:02:42,945 --> 01:02:44,378
- We'll try to.
- So long.

862
01:02:44,547 --> 01:02:46,378
- Good luck, men.
- Good luck, sir.

863
01:02:46,549 --> 01:02:47,538
Bye, sir.

864
01:03:17,647 --> 01:03:19,672
What's the matter, Bill, can't you sleep?

865
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:23,341
No, I keep thinking of those marines
back there on Wake.

866
01:03:25,021 --> 01:03:28,752
- They haven't got a prayer, Irish.
- No, I know they haven't.

867
01:03:29,592 --> 01:03:32,823
But they're gonna have some fun
before anybody gets on that island.

868
01:03:32,995 --> 01:03:34,485
Yeah.

869
01:03:42,672 --> 01:03:44,902
How are things, sergeant?

870
01:03:45,474 --> 01:03:48,204
Oh, I'm kind of...

871
01:03:48,377 --> 01:03:49,776
What the...?

872
01:03:53,382 --> 01:03:54,644
Why, it's a dog.

873
01:03:55,184 --> 01:03:57,448
Who belongs to this?

874
01:03:58,054 --> 01:03:59,885
Look at that. Is that your dog, chief?

875
01:04:00,056 --> 01:04:02,854
It ain't my dog. What kind
of a crew chief do you think I am?

876
01:04:03,025 --> 01:04:05,255
- I was just asking.
- Who brought him onboard?

877
01:04:05,428 --> 01:04:09,091
- Well, maybe he just walked on.
- And tied himself in a sack?

878
01:04:09,265 --> 01:04:11,028
- Come on, who did it?
- I didn't.

879
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,667
You, Weinberg?

880
01:04:12,835 --> 01:04:14,598
- Maybe the Marines done it.
- Sure.

881
01:04:14,770 --> 01:04:17,432
- If I'm not mistaken, they had a dog.
- His name was Rover.

882
01:04:17,606 --> 01:04:19,335
- No, his name was Tripoli.
- Talk fast.

883
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:20,770
- He had a cute trick.
- What?

884
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:25,039
Let's see if this is him. Look here, Tripoli.
What do you think of this Mr. Moto?

885
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:31,079
Moto. There you are. It's the same dog.

886
01:04:31,253 --> 01:04:34,620
I know the dog came from Wake Island
and I know you brought him onboard.

887
01:04:34,790 --> 01:04:36,519
- Me?
- You can get busted for this.

888
01:04:36,692 --> 01:04:38,592
Why don't you ask me, sergeant?

889
01:04:38,761 --> 01:04:39,989
- I did it.
- You?

890
01:04:40,162 --> 01:04:41,629
- Yeah, me. Shut up.
- Listen, Joe.

891
01:04:41,998 --> 01:04:44,330
You ought to know better
than do a trick like that.

892
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,297
- Why?
- Because it's against regulations.

893
01:04:46,469 --> 01:04:49,700
Makes no difference. Regulations...
You know why this dog is here.

894
01:04:49,872 --> 01:04:53,330
We know what chance those Marines have
on that island, so they gave us this dog.

895
01:04:53,509 --> 01:04:55,841
Go on up front and report me.
I've been busted out.

896
01:04:56,012 --> 01:04:59,243
- Now, Joe, I did it. I don't...
- Shut up. I'm getting sore.

897
01:04:59,415 --> 01:05:01,440
We got chased out
before we can even light...

898
01:05:01,617 --> 01:05:04,142
got kicked all over the place
by sneaking Nips...

899
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,185
and you're yapping about regulations.

900
01:05:06,355 --> 01:05:08,949
- You're changing your tune, ain't you?
- So, what if I am?

901
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:11,355
- I'd like to do a little chasing myself.
- Me too.

902
01:05:11,527 --> 01:05:13,552
- Go on, tell them.
- I'm a half a mind to...

903
01:05:13,729 --> 01:05:16,493
- I'd like to...
- Come here. Come here.

904
01:05:16,665 --> 01:05:18,530
- Come here.
- Why'd you wanna do that for?

905
01:05:18,701 --> 01:05:20,362
Pipe down.

906
01:05:23,139 --> 01:05:25,437
Hey, look what's here.

907
01:05:26,208 --> 01:05:28,073
What is this, sergeant? Noah's Ark?

908
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:30,576
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Who brought him on this airplane?

909
01:05:30,746 --> 01:05:33,180
- He could have jumped on.
- Or flown in the window...

910
01:05:33,349 --> 01:05:35,078
but he didn't.
- No, sir.

911
01:05:35,251 --> 01:05:37,344
- You know it's against regulations.
- Yes, sir.

912
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,284
And you don't know who did it?
You didn't see anybody do it?

913
01:05:40,456 --> 01:05:42,219
No, sir, I didn't.

914
01:05:43,692 --> 01:05:46,252
We can't very well throw him out now,
can we?

915
01:05:46,429 --> 01:05:48,761
- We could take care of him, sir.
- We can?

916
01:05:48,931 --> 01:05:51,229
- Yes, sir.
- Who back there likes dogs, sergeant?

917
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,460
Why, I think Winocki and Weinberg
like dogs.

918
01:05:54,637 --> 01:05:58,198
- You think they'd like to take care of him?
- Yes, sir. I think they would.

919
01:05:58,374 --> 01:06:01,275
- All right, sergeant, you tell them.
- Yes, sir. I'll tell them.

920
01:06:01,444 --> 01:06:04,538
It'll be pretty tough on you
if we gotta fly over that stuff ahead.

921
01:06:04,713 --> 01:06:06,476
We can fix that.

922
01:06:06,649 --> 01:06:08,640
He's a cute little pooch.

923
01:06:08,818 --> 01:06:12,481
- What's his name?
- I think they call him "Tripoli."

924
01:06:12,655 --> 01:06:15,249
- Tripoli?
- Yes. He don't like Japs.

925
01:06:15,424 --> 01:06:18,689
Tripoli, what do you think
of that guy Moto?

926
01:06:19,795 --> 01:06:22,525
So you don't like Moto, huh?

927
01:06:29,805 --> 01:06:31,830
Well, what is this, a flying doghouse?

928
01:06:32,007 --> 01:06:33,872
Look out.
He doesn't like pursuit pilots.

929
01:06:34,043 --> 01:06:35,135
- What's his name?
- Moto.

930
01:06:35,311 --> 01:06:36,300
Hi, Moto.

931
01:06:36,479 --> 01:06:38,947
- Didn't we tell you?
- That dog's a judge of character.

932
01:06:39,115 --> 01:06:41,276
Here, Moto. Be nice, Moto.
Hello, Moto.

933
01:06:42,284 --> 01:06:45,185
He doesn't like me.
I'm getting out of here.

934
01:06:45,354 --> 01:06:47,686
Tripoli, you're gonna be
very useful around here.

935
01:06:47,857 --> 01:06:50,690
- Take good care of him, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

936
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,393
Well, did you tell him
how the pup got aboard?

937
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:01,934
- No.
- You didn't?

938
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:04,334
But I'm telling you to take care of him.

939
01:07:04,507 --> 01:07:07,499
If he don't behave himself,
you can take care of that too.

940
01:07:08,010 --> 01:07:09,238
Pilot to crew.

941
01:07:09,411 --> 01:07:13,006
We're going up to 20,000.
Better check your oxygen.

942
01:07:26,795 --> 01:07:29,059
There you are, Tripoli.

943
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,969
He seems to like it all right.
He ain't putting up no kick.

944
01:07:54,957 --> 01:07:57,755
Just like a baby on a bottle.

945
01:08:18,647 --> 01:08:20,877
05564 to Clark Field.

946
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:23,814
- Here they are, sir.
- 05564 to Clark.

947
01:08:23,986 --> 01:08:27,285
Clark Field to 05564.
What's your position? Go ahead.

948
01:08:27,456 --> 01:08:30,084
We're about four miles
northeast of the field.

949
01:08:30,259 --> 01:08:32,887
Two thousand.
What are your landing instructions?

950
01:08:33,529 --> 01:08:36,157
We've only got one runway.
North to south.

951
01:08:36,332 --> 01:08:38,425
It's pretty rough.
The Japs just had a picnic.

952
01:08:38,601 --> 01:08:40,694
Someday we're gonna find a field
that's flat.

953
01:08:40,869 --> 01:08:43,838
Hold him off a while.
Those tractors are still working out there.

954
01:08:44,006 --> 01:08:47,032
Do not land. Keep your altitude.
Do not land.

955
01:08:47,209 --> 01:08:50,406
Sorry, have to come straight in.
Running out of fuel.

956
01:08:50,579 --> 01:08:52,604
Sergeant, get those tractors
off that runway.

957
01:08:52,781 --> 01:08:56,478
- Tell him to come in low over the fence.
- Come in low over the fence. South end.

958
01:08:56,652 --> 01:08:58,643
Cut close to the wire,
you haven't much room.

959
01:08:58,821 --> 01:09:00,948
Tractors working down
the middle of the runway.

960
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:11,157
We've got the fence with us.

961
01:09:30,219 --> 01:09:32,653
- Take a look, Robby.
- Yes, sir.

962
01:09:55,978 --> 01:09:58,003
- Hi there, Irish.
- Hi, major.

963
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:01,911
Say, when we were at Kelly Field,
didn't I teach you how to get over a fence?

964
01:10:02,084 --> 01:10:04,644
That's one way to stop quick.
I just cut her too fine.

965
01:10:05,654 --> 01:10:08,418
Not bad, anyway.
After 7000 consecutive miles...

966
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:10,353
you did a great job, all of you.

967
01:10:10,526 --> 01:10:12,460
- Hi there, Rader.
- Hi you, sir.

968
01:10:12,628 --> 01:10:16,394
- Don't tell me you've joined the bombers.
- No, I still belong to the opposition.

969
01:10:16,598 --> 01:10:18,896
He doesn't appreciate
a good airplane, major.

970
01:10:19,068 --> 01:10:21,502
It ain't that.
It's just that I don't like them big.

971
01:10:21,670 --> 01:10:24,366
- Tail wheel clear, sir. No damage.
- Okay.

972
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:27,065
Take her down the end
and get her a full load of gas...

973
01:10:27,242 --> 01:10:29,836
drop your extra tanks
and get ready for action, Irish.

974
01:10:30,012 --> 01:10:31,946
- Okay, major.
- The Japs been hitting us...

975
01:10:32,114 --> 01:10:35,606
with 60 bombers at a clip.
You gotta be ready to take off at any time.

976
01:10:35,784 --> 01:10:38,309
You can see yourself,
you're wide open on the ground.

977
01:10:38,487 --> 01:10:41,251
Colonel Blake wants to see you.
I'll pick you up in a while.

978
01:10:41,423 --> 01:10:43,152
All right, sir.

979
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,261
Hold it.

980
01:10:58,173 --> 01:11:00,141
You got any sectional maps
for around here?

981
01:11:00,309 --> 01:11:03,176
- Yeah, but I haven't got enough.
- Grab as many as you can get.

982
01:11:03,345 --> 01:11:06,007
Find out what size bombs
they'll give us and load them.

983
01:11:06,181 --> 01:11:07,409
- Okay.
- I'll go with you.

984
01:11:07,583 --> 01:11:09,915
- Thanks for the buggy ride, Irish.
- Okay, Tex.

985
01:11:10,085 --> 01:11:12,076
- Weinberg, open the bomb bay.
- Right.

986
01:11:12,254 --> 01:11:13,551
Peterson, check your radio.

987
01:11:13,722 --> 01:11:15,986
You and Chester, give him a hand
with the loading.

988
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:19,286
Winocki, find the line chief
and see if they'll give you a transfer.

989
01:11:19,661 --> 01:11:23,688
We'll get somebody to replace you.
All right, get going.

990
01:11:26,835 --> 01:11:28,530
- Okay.
- Winocki.

991
01:11:28,704 --> 01:11:30,968
You wanna get out of this crew?

992
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,540
- That's what you want me to do?
- Not necessarily.

993
01:11:33,709 --> 01:11:35,734
You'd take that stuff
I've been handing you?

994
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:38,971
- We all make mistakes.
- I'm beginning to realize that myself. I...

995
01:11:39,148 --> 01:11:42,606
Turn that dog over to the nearest Marine
and get back and check those guns.

996
01:11:42,785 --> 01:11:45,913
- Give them a good going over.
- Yes, sir.

997
01:11:49,958 --> 01:11:51,755
Be ready as quick as you can, sergeant.

998
01:11:51,927 --> 01:11:54,521
- Okay, Bill, let's go.
- Oh, captain.

999
01:11:54,797 --> 01:11:56,560
Excuse me, sir.

1000
01:11:56,732 --> 01:11:59,496
Would you see if you could find out
something about my boy?

1001
01:11:59,668 --> 01:12:01,761
Sure, I will, sergeant.

1002
01:12:02,638 --> 01:12:06,665
- Hey, buddy, any Marines around here?
- If so, the place would be in better shape.

1003
01:12:06,842 --> 01:12:08,332
- You a Marine?
- What's it to you?

1004
01:12:08,510 --> 01:12:11,070
- You're one all right. Got this for you.
- What's this?

1005
01:12:11,246 --> 01:12:14,943
You outfit on Wake gave it to us to deliver.
His name is Tripoli. Feed him good.

1006
01:12:15,117 --> 01:12:17,642
- He'll eat like a company commander.
- What's your name?

1007
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,151
Callahan. Thanks.

1008
01:12:23,892 --> 01:12:26,190
- You all ready up there?
- All ready.

1009
01:12:26,361 --> 01:12:29,455
Let it go. Watch her, boys.

1010
01:12:30,299 --> 01:12:32,358
Steady. Keep her level.

1011
01:12:32,534 --> 01:12:34,399
Now turn her, fellows.

1012
01:12:34,870 --> 01:12:36,428
Turn her.

1013
01:12:38,073 --> 01:12:40,098
Hurry it up, boys. Make it snappy.

1014
01:12:44,313 --> 01:12:46,042
That's about it.

1015
01:12:53,121 --> 01:12:54,486
Take the strain off.

1016
01:12:54,656 --> 01:12:56,248
Take it away.

1017
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:05,890
That's the situation as it stands
right now.

1018
01:13:06,068 --> 01:13:08,502
- I've given the facts to you straight.
- Yes, sir.

1019
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:11,366
We've taken a licking
because we were caught on the ground.

1020
01:13:11,573 --> 01:13:13,632
Since then,
they've outnumbered us 10-to-1.

1021
01:13:13,809 --> 01:13:17,472
Yet every time we've been up against them,
they've lost five to our one.

1022
01:13:17,646 --> 01:13:20,740
In other words, if we were anywhere
near equal, we could lick them.

1023
01:13:20,916 --> 01:13:22,315
The record proves it.

1024
01:13:22,484 --> 01:13:25,317
From now on, our job's
to keep fighting with what we've got...

1025
01:13:25,487 --> 01:13:28,183
till we get enough airplanes
to blast them off the earth.

1026
01:13:28,357 --> 01:13:30,222
How long since you had
any sleep, captain?

1027
01:13:30,392 --> 01:13:33,122
- We haven't had much time.
- When did you leave the mainland?

1028
01:13:33,295 --> 01:13:35,695
- Saturday night.
- Three days and three nights flying.

1029
01:13:35,864 --> 01:13:37,092
You've done a good job.

1030
01:13:37,266 --> 01:13:39,666
- I've got a good crew, sir.
- Yeah, I can believe it.

1031
01:13:39,835 --> 01:13:41,700
- Excuse me, sir.
- What'd you find, Moran?

1032
01:13:41,870 --> 01:13:44,270
That PT boat was right.
Looks like an invasion fleet.

1033
01:13:44,439 --> 01:13:46,669
- What's in it?
- There's a transport and a tanker.

1034
01:13:46,842 --> 01:13:49,675
- Got a battleship or cruiser and destroyers.
- Where?

1035
01:13:49,845 --> 01:13:51,972
Forty miles off Lingayen
last time I saw them.

1036
01:13:52,147 --> 01:13:55,480
I didn't have much time to stick around.
Sky suddenly got full of Zeros.

1037
01:13:55,651 --> 01:13:56,743
So I headed for home.

1038
01:13:56,919 --> 01:13:59,945
I marked their position
and course on this chart.

1039
01:14:00,122 --> 01:14:03,455
Right here. A flight of Boeing B-17s
could give them a nice party, sir.

1040
01:14:03,625 --> 01:14:07,083
- We haven't got a flight of B-17s.
- You've got one, sir, loading up now.

1041
01:14:07,262 --> 01:14:08,957
- You wanna tackle it?
- Yes, sir.

1042
01:14:09,131 --> 01:14:12,828
All right, study this first.
Take your time, don't take any chances.

1043
01:14:13,001 --> 01:14:14,969
Moran will give you the dope
and good luck.

1044
01:14:15,137 --> 01:14:16,934
Excuse me, sir. There's one thing more.

1045
01:14:17,105 --> 01:14:19,869
I told our crew chief I'd find out
about his son, Lt. White.

1046
01:14:20,042 --> 01:14:22,602
Danny White. Can you tell me
anything about him, sir?

1047
01:14:22,778 --> 01:14:26,236
Yeah, I can. He was killed the first day.

1048
01:14:26,415 --> 01:14:28,212
That's a shame.

1049
01:14:28,984 --> 01:14:32,579
Give these to old Robbie, will you?
I've known him for a long time.

1050
01:14:32,754 --> 01:14:33,982
How did it happen, sir?

1051
01:14:34,156 --> 01:14:37,091
Capt. Anderson in the other office
can tell you more than I can.

1052
01:14:37,259 --> 01:14:39,227
He saw the whole thing happen.

1053
01:14:39,394 --> 01:14:40,827
Yes, sir.

1054
01:15:01,183 --> 01:15:03,310
Did you find out anything, sir?

1055
01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:19,701
How'd it happen?

1056
01:15:19,868 --> 01:15:22,860
He was trying to take his flight off
during the first raid.

1057
01:15:23,038 --> 01:15:24,369
Before he could get off...

1058
01:15:24,539 --> 01:15:27,736
they hit the runway
right in front of him with a big one.

1059
01:15:29,478 --> 01:15:32,140
Didn't even get into the air.

1060
01:15:39,454 --> 01:15:45,450
It's not much to show for 20 years,
is it, sir?

1061
01:15:57,072 --> 01:15:58,596
Get that airplane off the ground.

1062
01:15:59,141 --> 01:16:01,701
- All right, sergeant, let's go.
- Yes, sir.

1063
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:03,811
Pull that dolly out.

1064
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:05,708
- Close the bomb bay.
- How many loaded?

1065
01:16:05,881 --> 01:16:08,281
- Three, sir. All big ones.
- Thousand pounders?

1066
01:16:08,450 --> 01:16:10,213
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

1067
01:16:24,599 --> 01:16:26,567
Come on, let's get this thing out of here.

1068
01:16:33,041 --> 01:16:34,668
Take it away.

1069
01:16:48,757 --> 01:16:51,282
Doors are closed. Everything all set, sir.

1070
01:17:52,721 --> 01:17:54,279
Wheels up.

1071
01:17:54,956 --> 01:17:56,446
- Wheels up.
- Monk?

1072
01:17:56,625 --> 01:17:58,058
- Go ahead.
- What do you make it?

1073
01:17:58,226 --> 01:17:59,557
Three-thirty-one, Irish.

1074
01:17:59,728 --> 01:18:01,559
Okay, 331.

1075
01:18:10,639 --> 01:18:14,200
- You better put on your chute, Robbie.
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:18:44,072 --> 01:18:45,061
Navigator to pilot.

1077
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,538
- Go ahead.
- We're about 30 miles off the coast.

1078
01:18:47,709 --> 01:18:49,301
You better go down
and take a look.

1079
01:18:49,477 --> 01:18:52,378
Okay. Going down.

1080
01:19:21,710 --> 01:19:23,405
Fighters.

1081
01:19:25,814 --> 01:19:28,510
Pilot to crew.
There's a flock of Zeros ahead.

1082
01:19:28,683 --> 01:19:31,777
Two o'clock at about 3000 feet above us.

1083
01:19:34,723 --> 01:19:37,817
There's another bunch at 10 o'clock.
Take your time.

1084
01:19:37,993 --> 01:19:40,757
Sing out if they get on our tail
and I'll kick her around.

1085
01:19:40,929 --> 01:19:44,387
Make it count.
We've got a lot to get even for.

1086
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,035
Here they come.

1087
01:20:04,286 --> 01:20:06,550
Coming over.

1088
01:20:22,537 --> 01:20:25,438
Did you see that?
They break up in little pieces.

1089
01:20:33,882 --> 01:20:36,112
Winocki, one at 9 o'clock even.
Coming down.

1090
01:20:40,588 --> 01:20:42,385
Coming over.

1091
01:20:53,535 --> 01:20:54,524
Great.

1092
01:21:08,883 --> 01:21:10,612
Kick it left.

1093
01:21:12,354 --> 01:21:14,618
Take it to the right.

1094
01:21:22,731 --> 01:21:25,063
Hey, Joe. Fried Jap going down.

1095
01:21:37,212 --> 01:21:38,941
Gas line on two.

1096
01:21:39,114 --> 01:21:40,172
Gas line on two.

1097
01:21:46,588 --> 01:21:48,385
- Oil line's burning.
- Yeah.

1098
01:21:48,556 --> 01:21:50,922
It looks like we'll have to bail out.

1099
01:21:51,092 --> 01:21:53,151
Pilot to crew.

1100
01:21:54,629 --> 01:21:56,256
Are you hurt, Irish?

1101
01:21:56,431 --> 01:21:57,659
Yeah.

1102
01:21:57,832 --> 01:22:00,027
Pilot to crew. Abandon ship.

1103
01:22:06,007 --> 01:22:09,033
All right, come on, kids.

1104
01:22:14,115 --> 01:22:17,380
Tommy, get rid of your sight. You and Monk
go out through the bomb bay.

1105
01:22:17,552 --> 01:22:19,213
- I know...
- I'll use the escape hatch.

1106
01:22:19,387 --> 01:22:20,615
- But you're hurt.
- Go on.

1107
01:22:20,789 --> 01:22:23,917
They'll have to drag
the bottom of the ocean to get this.

1108
01:22:24,092 --> 01:22:27,391
- Open the escape hatch. I'll throw it out.
- Right.

1109
01:22:34,069 --> 01:22:36,094
- Irish, you...
- Go on, get out.

1110
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:45,074
You're about 15 or 20 miles
northwest of the field. Get out.

1111
01:22:45,246 --> 01:22:47,077
Yes, sir. Go ahead, Peterson.

1112
01:22:50,285 --> 01:22:53,152
- Weinberg.
- I don't think I'm gonna like this.

1113
01:22:53,321 --> 01:22:54,811
Go on.

1114
01:22:54,989 --> 01:22:55,978
All right, kid.

1115
01:23:07,902 --> 01:23:10,063
- Winocki.
- Go ahead, I'm coming.

1116
01:23:10,238 --> 01:23:11,967
Okay.

1117
01:23:51,012 --> 01:23:53,674
05564 to Clark Field.

1118
01:23:53,848 --> 01:23:56,282
Emergency landing. Emergency landing.

1119
01:23:56,451 --> 01:23:59,614
- There she is, sir. One engine's burning.
- Get your wheels down.

1120
01:23:59,787 --> 01:24:02,847
I can't do it. Gear's jammed.
It won't come down.

1121
01:24:48,903 --> 01:24:51,269
- Well, Joe?
- I just had a look at that B-17, sir.

1122
01:24:51,439 --> 01:24:52,428
What about her?

1123
01:24:52,607 --> 01:24:54,734
I counted over a hundred
bullet holes in her.

1124
01:24:54,909 --> 01:24:59,243
Two motors hit, props are bent,
controls in a mess, wheels damaged...

1125
01:24:59,414 --> 01:25:01,712
fuel tanks are punctured,
one wing's gone.

1126
01:25:01,883 --> 01:25:03,111
At least the tip.

1127
01:25:03,284 --> 01:25:05,980
- I don't see how they brought her down.
- Neither do I.

1128
01:25:06,154 --> 01:25:08,987
I suppose if we had 10 days
and plenty of spare parts...

1129
01:25:09,157 --> 01:25:10,590
we might make her fly again.

1130
01:25:10,758 --> 01:25:12,817
I don't know that we'll have 24 hours.

1131
01:25:12,994 --> 01:25:16,623
- We'll have to write off the Mary Ann.
- All right, we'll destroy her.

1132
01:25:16,798 --> 01:25:19,562
No use lighting any fires tonight.
They'd only hit us again.

1133
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:21,895
Joe, send out a demolition squad
in the morning.

1134
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:24,368
- All right, sir.
- So long.

1135
01:25:24,539 --> 01:25:27,133
- What about the crew?
- They all got back all right, sir.

1136
01:25:27,308 --> 01:25:29,538
- Where are they now?
- Over at the hospital.

1137
01:25:29,711 --> 01:25:32,612
- Quincannon asked to see them.
- How's he?

1138
01:25:33,581 --> 01:25:35,412
That's too bad.

1139
01:25:35,883 --> 01:25:37,350
Yeah.

1140
01:26:07,081 --> 01:26:09,447
It's good to see you.

1141
01:26:11,152 --> 01:26:14,315
What are you...?
What are you doing with that rifle, Tex?

1142
01:26:15,790 --> 01:26:18,520
Picked up too many slugs
in the P-39, Irish.

1143
01:26:18,693 --> 01:26:20,183
I'm a foot soldier now.

1144
01:26:20,361 --> 01:26:22,522
They finally got him where he belongs.

1145
01:26:22,697 --> 01:26:24,460
Anyway, we was using up
Japs so fast...

1146
01:26:24,632 --> 01:26:27,829
they was afraid
there wouldn't be none left to surrender.

1147
01:26:29,437 --> 01:26:31,530
- Winocki?
- Yes, sir.

1148
01:26:31,706 --> 01:26:35,005
- They told me you brought her in.
- He did, sir.

1149
01:26:35,176 --> 01:26:38,509
She came in herself. I just sat there.

1150
01:26:38,680 --> 01:26:40,739
It was a good job.

1151
01:26:40,915 --> 01:26:42,974
She's all right, huh?

1152
01:26:44,118 --> 01:26:47,554
She's all right, isn't she?

1153
01:26:50,558 --> 01:26:52,219
- Robbie.
- Yes, sir?

1154
01:26:52,393 --> 01:26:55,988
- She's all right, she'll fly again?
- Sure she will, skipper.

1155
01:26:56,164 --> 01:26:57,222
What's wrong with her?

1156
01:26:57,398 --> 01:26:59,195
- She's gonna be all right.
- Tell me.

1157
01:27:01,536 --> 01:27:05,472
- Props, gear, wing tip.
- Just a tip?

1158
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:07,437
It's a wing tip, sir.
Couple of days...

1159
01:27:08,209 --> 01:27:10,871
- Two days?
- Two days. Yes, sir.

1160
01:27:11,045 --> 01:27:13,104
But she will fly again?

1161
01:27:14,215 --> 01:27:17,241
- Yeah.
- That's fine.

1162
01:27:18,286 --> 01:27:21,084
Get as many men as you need, Robbie.

1163
01:27:21,255 --> 01:27:23,587
The colonel will give them to you.

1164
01:27:24,092 --> 01:27:27,584
I'll get a clearance.
We'll leave right away.

1165
01:27:27,762 --> 01:27:29,252
- We gotta hurry.
- Nurse.

1166
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:32,126
Easy, easy, Irish.

1167
01:27:32,300 --> 01:27:36,066
- Get the doctor right away.
- Oh, no. No, the doctor can't go.

1168
01:27:36,637 --> 01:27:38,468
Regulations.

1169
01:27:42,377 --> 01:27:45,813
Besides, we already got one passenger.

1170
01:27:46,381 --> 01:27:50,647
Is he here, that pursuit pilot?

1171
01:27:51,853 --> 01:27:55,983
- Here, sir.
- Okay, start them, Bill.

1172
01:27:58,893 --> 01:27:59,882
Sure, Irish.

1173
01:28:01,729 --> 01:28:02,718
Everybody in, chief?

1174
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:05,727
All in, sir.

1175
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:08,528
- Doors closed?
- Yes, sir.

1176
01:28:08,703 --> 01:28:10,762
Here we go.

1177
01:28:15,109 --> 01:28:17,270
- Lock them.
- Locked.

1178
01:28:18,246 --> 01:28:19,838
Wheels up.

1179
01:28:21,149 --> 01:28:24,744
- Coming up.
- They sound like they're gonna run all right.

1180
01:28:24,919 --> 01:28:27,387
- Robbie?
- Yes, sir.

1181
01:28:27,555 --> 01:28:29,853
- Pilot to navigator.
- Go ahead.

1182
01:28:30,024 --> 01:28:31,389
Monk.

1183
01:28:31,959 --> 01:28:34,928
- Monk, what's our course?
- Due east, skipper.

1184
01:28:35,596 --> 01:28:39,327
That's right into the sunrise.

1185
01:28:40,134 --> 01:28:44,764
- Right into the sunrise.
- Over here, major.

1186
01:28:53,981 --> 01:28:55,846
That's all, boys.

1187
01:29:00,988 --> 01:29:04,446
Well, let's get going, fellas.

1188
01:29:04,625 --> 01:29:06,490
We got a lot to do.

1189
01:29:19,140 --> 01:29:20,801
- Corporal?
- There's something wrong.

1190
01:29:20,975 --> 01:29:22,203
- Yeah? What?
- I don't know.

1191
01:29:22,376 --> 01:29:23,707
But there's something wrong.

1192
01:29:23,878 --> 01:29:26,642
- What are you talking about?
- We was to burn them airplanes.

1193
01:29:26,814 --> 01:29:28,748
- Well, did you?
- No, not all of them, sir.

1194
01:29:28,916 --> 01:29:30,349
- Why not?
- They're being stolen.

1195
01:29:30,518 --> 01:29:31,815
- What?
- Japs are stealing it.

1196
01:29:31,986 --> 01:29:33,146
Don't talk nonsense, man.

1197
01:29:33,321 --> 01:29:35,721
There have been Japanese
through but they're snipers.

1198
01:29:35,890 --> 01:29:37,187
- They're not stealing.
- But...

1199
01:29:37,358 --> 01:29:39,758
Now, wait a minute, Mallory.
Let's get this straight.

1200
01:29:39,927 --> 01:29:42,452
- You had five B-17s to demolish.
- Yes, sir.

1201
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,791
- What is it you wanna tell us?
- They're missing.

1202
01:29:44,966 --> 01:29:47,366
- You mean parts of them?
- Sure. I mean, yes, sir.

1203
01:29:47,535 --> 01:29:49,435
- Why on earth would anybody...?
- Now, look.

1204
01:29:49,604 --> 01:29:51,765
There's a B-17,
the one that came in yesterday.

1205
01:29:51,939 --> 01:29:53,770
- The Mary Ann.
- Have you burned it?

1206
01:29:53,941 --> 01:29:54,930
- No, sir.
- Why not?

1207
01:29:55,109 --> 01:29:57,669
We was, but I told the boys
I ought to report them Japs.

1208
01:29:57,845 --> 01:29:59,813
Well, you've reported.
You better burn it.

1209
01:29:59,981 --> 01:30:01,505
Yes, sir.

1210
01:30:05,786 --> 01:30:07,083
What was he talking about?

1211
01:30:07,255 --> 01:30:09,849
I don't know, sir,
but I'd better go out and have a look.

1212
01:30:10,024 --> 01:30:11,685
I'll go with you.

1213
01:30:20,134 --> 01:30:22,295
There's the stuff we've been missing.

1214
01:30:23,237 --> 01:30:25,205
- How's it coming, chief?
- All right.

1215
01:30:25,373 --> 01:30:28,240
- All right, Weinberg, lower away.
- Okay.

1216
01:30:28,409 --> 01:30:31,207
- Hey, sarge, your guns loaded?
- Sure they are. Keep a coming.

1217
01:30:31,379 --> 01:30:33,347
- Any bombs in?
- No, not yet. Come on.

1218
01:30:33,514 --> 01:30:35,243
- Get down, sarge.
- Get away from here.

1219
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:37,884
- Get down. We're gonna burn this junk.
- What?

1220
01:30:38,052 --> 01:30:40,850
A couple of you get in there
and get the live ammunition out.

1221
01:30:41,022 --> 01:30:42,956
Hey, wait a minute.

1222
01:30:43,124 --> 01:30:44,716
You said you gonna burn this plane?

1223
01:30:44,892 --> 01:30:47,861
The colonel said to burn it so she's gonna.
Get your stuff out.

1224
01:30:48,029 --> 01:30:50,259
Okay, boys. Bring in the gas.

1225
01:30:50,531 --> 01:30:53,193
Wait a minute.
Get this gasoline away from that airplane.

1226
01:30:53,367 --> 01:30:56,029
- Hey, Butch.
- Weinberg.

1227
01:30:56,203 --> 01:30:58,535
I thought you still was
on a streetcar in Jersey.

1228
01:30:58,706 --> 01:31:00,435
- I wished I was.
- Lieutenant Williams.

1229
01:31:00,608 --> 01:31:03,008
- You ain't gonna burn that airplane?
- I got orders.

1230
01:31:03,177 --> 01:31:05,441
- I never enlisted to be no fireman.
- Go on.

1231
01:31:05,613 --> 01:31:08,548
If you know this firebug,
get him out of here before he gets hurt.

1232
01:31:08,716 --> 01:31:10,377
I don't wanna, but orders is orders.

1233
01:31:10,551 --> 01:31:12,018
- What orders?
- To burn the plane.

1234
01:31:12,186 --> 01:31:13,551
- Who gave them to you?
- The CO.

1235
01:31:13,721 --> 01:31:17,350
Yeah? Well, you tell that CO to take a...
Take a look at this airplane.

1236
01:31:17,525 --> 01:31:19,117
- I am.
- Sorry, I didn't see you.

1237
01:31:19,293 --> 01:31:21,989
- Apparently not.
- There's no reason to burn this airplane.

1238
01:31:22,163 --> 01:31:24,893
- She's gonna be good as new.
- We're gonna rig a tail gun.

1239
01:31:25,066 --> 01:31:27,694
- Been working all night.
- She'll fly when we get through.

1240
01:31:27,868 --> 01:31:31,099
- We'll have her in the air in 24 hours.
- We won't have this field.

1241
01:31:31,272 --> 01:31:32,500
- I know, but...
- Now, look.

1242
01:31:32,673 --> 01:31:34,470
I appreciate what you're trying to do.

1243
01:31:34,642 --> 01:31:37,770
But our job's to destroy everything
that'll be of use to those Japs.

1244
01:31:37,945 --> 01:31:39,742
Excuse me, but we can't move any gas.

1245
01:31:39,914 --> 01:31:42,849
- The trucks have all been wrecked.
- Scare up drums. Get it here.

1246
01:31:43,017 --> 01:31:45,212
- You can't get that ready in time to...
- We can.

1247
01:31:45,386 --> 01:31:49,015
- The bomb sight still in this airplane?
- Yes, sir. The one we "borrowed."

1248
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:50,589
- We won't let...
- Give us a chance.

1249
01:31:50,758 --> 01:31:52,350
- I'd like to, but...
- Excuse me, sir.

1250
01:31:52,526 --> 01:31:55,461
I've been in this Army 20 years.
I've never asked a favor.

1251
01:31:55,630 --> 01:31:59,225
- We'll get her out. I give you my word.
- We'll burn her ourselves if we can't.

1252
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:03,530
You're crazy. You know what'll happen
if the Japs move in?

1253
01:32:03,704 --> 01:32:04,932
- We do, sir.
- All the rest?

1254
01:32:05,106 --> 01:32:06,334
- Yes, sir.
- You'll burn her?

1255
01:32:06,507 --> 01:32:08,065
Yes, sir.

1256
01:32:08,242 --> 01:32:11,336
All right. It's your funeral.
Forget it, corporal.

1257
01:32:11,512 --> 01:32:13,139
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1258
01:32:13,314 --> 01:32:15,248
- Come on, boys. Let's...
- Excuse me, sir.

1259
01:32:15,416 --> 01:32:17,884
That observation plane is patched up
and ready to go.

1260
01:32:18,052 --> 01:32:19,383
But I'm gonna need a gunner.

1261
01:32:19,553 --> 01:32:20,542
- Lieutenant.
- Yes?

1262
01:32:20,721 --> 01:32:23,315
I'll need one of your gunners.
Which one can you spare?

1263
01:32:23,491 --> 01:32:24,515
- Well...
- I can go.

1264
01:32:24,692 --> 01:32:26,216
- Wait a minute.
- He shouldn't go.

1265
01:32:26,394 --> 01:32:28,419
- He's more useful here.
- He's right, sir.

1266
01:32:28,596 --> 01:32:31,463
- All right. Go ahead.
- Yes, sir.

1267
01:32:31,966 --> 01:32:34,093
- That kid's awfully green, lieutenant.
- I know.

1268
01:32:34,268 --> 01:32:36,759
- Come on, give us a hand.
- Okay.

1269
01:32:54,855 --> 01:32:57,517
Don't like him leaving Mary Ann
this way. Ain't good luck.

1270
01:32:57,692 --> 01:32:59,683
Be back in a couple of hours.
Swing it wide.

1271
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:01,350
- Put some muscle into it.
- Will I!

1272
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:11,995
Where'd you find
that little beast, sergeant?

1273
01:33:12,173 --> 01:33:14,437
Beast?
He's a Marine Corps dog, lieutenant.

1274
01:33:14,608 --> 01:33:16,872
Yeah, I know. Hiya, Moto.

1275
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:20,704
Hey, Moto, cut it out.
Cut it out.

1276
01:33:20,881 --> 01:33:22,872
Get him away, sergeant.

1277
01:33:23,050 --> 01:33:26,486
I've had enough trouble with Jap snipers
without getting hydrophobia.

1278
01:33:26,654 --> 01:33:29,088
- His name ain't Moto, it's Tripoli.
- What?

1279
01:33:29,256 --> 01:33:32,191
Yeah, Tripoli. Maybe he don't
like to be called Moto.

1280
01:33:32,359 --> 01:33:34,156
That's it. Cute trick, ain't it?

1281
01:33:35,596 --> 01:33:37,826
Yeah, very cute.

1282
01:33:42,470 --> 01:33:45,439
- How's it going, Rader?
- Not good. They're withdrawing to Bataan.

1283
01:33:45,606 --> 01:33:49,007
All I could get was a foxhole view
with my face in six inches of dirt.

1284
01:33:49,176 --> 01:33:51,406
I thought if I came back
I could get an airplane.

1285
01:33:51,579 --> 01:33:54,047
You've got a fat chance for that.
We got one 0-47 left.

1286
01:33:54,215 --> 01:33:56,183
We might get you to Batavia
or Port Darwin.

1287
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,477
- They've got airplanes.
- We're getting out too.

1288
01:33:58,652 --> 01:34:01,485
- How about that B-17 I came in with?
- What? That crazy outfit?

1289
01:34:01,655 --> 01:34:03,885
They're working on it.
They've been up all night.

1290
01:34:04,058 --> 01:34:08,188
- Robbing the other wrecks for spare parts.
- Haven't got a chance getting it to fly.

1291
01:34:08,362 --> 01:34:10,023
- Forget it.
- But can I help them?

1292
01:34:10,197 --> 01:34:12,597
What kind of lunatics have we got
in this Air Corps?

1293
01:34:12,767 --> 01:34:15,099
- Don't you know what's impossible?
- Thank you, sir.

1294
01:34:15,269 --> 01:34:16,497
- Hey.
- Excuse me, colonel.

1295
01:34:16,670 --> 01:34:18,103
- What?
- Can't I lend a hand too?

1296
01:34:18,272 --> 01:34:20,672
- You can go straight to...
- Help, sir? Thank you, sir.

1297
01:34:20,841 --> 01:34:22,900
Come on, stay with me. Come on.

1298
01:34:25,780 --> 01:34:28,214
- Hello, Weinberg.
- Gee, it's the pursuit pilot.

1299
01:34:28,382 --> 01:34:31,476
- We thought you was in the infantry.
- It's too hard on the feet.

1300
01:34:31,652 --> 01:34:32,983
- Hi, fellas.
- Hi, Tex.

1301
01:34:33,154 --> 01:34:36,521
- Things get too tough for you?
- I came to see if I could give you a hand.

1302
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:38,282
How you making out with Moto there?

1303
01:34:38,459 --> 01:34:41,189
I'm getting along fine, Tommy,
with Tripoli.

1304
01:34:41,362 --> 01:34:43,853
- I knew it all along, you morons.
- Sure, sure.

1305
01:34:44,031 --> 01:34:46,124
Looks like you guys got yourself a job.

1306
01:34:46,300 --> 01:34:49,098
- How about me and the Marine Corps?
- Listen to who's talking.

1307
01:34:49,270 --> 01:34:50,601
You asking to join this crew?

1308
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:53,001
I'd rather fly than walk.
Even in this crate.

1309
01:34:53,174 --> 01:34:56,405
- Changed your mind, haven't you?
- No, but I'm willing to work my way.

1310
01:34:56,577 --> 01:34:58,511
Stop grinning and tell me what to do.

1311
01:34:58,679 --> 01:34:59,976
- Are you serious?
- Why, sure.

1312
01:35:00,147 --> 01:35:03,344
What we need is gas. I don't know
how you're gonna get it, but get it.

1313
01:35:03,517 --> 01:35:06,042
Take the Marine with you
so you can find your way back.

1314
01:35:06,220 --> 01:35:07,482
Okay, Callahan.

1315
01:35:09,423 --> 01:35:13,086
- Watch it now. Watch it.
- Pick up. Pick up the end.

1316
01:35:13,561 --> 01:35:16,587
All right. That's got her. Now, give me that.
Where's Weinberg?

1317
01:35:16,764 --> 01:35:18,595
- Left for oil. He'll be back.
- Okay.

1318
01:35:26,874 --> 01:35:29,274
Hey, those are Jap planes.

1319
01:35:29,443 --> 01:35:31,502
Get going, men.

1320
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:33,442
Get on the guns.

1321
01:36:19,059 --> 01:36:21,619
Bring some more ammunition.

1322
01:36:56,964 --> 01:36:58,226
Good work, Robbie.

1323
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:00,697
- Don't talk. Shoot.
- There's another one for you.

1324
01:37:29,229 --> 01:37:31,220
You dog!

1325
01:37:51,885 --> 01:37:55,343
Look, they're after the kid.

1326
01:38:20,714 --> 01:38:23,774
- They're gonna get him on the way down.
- Look out, kid.

1327
01:38:29,623 --> 01:38:31,887
Stay here, Weinberg.

1328
01:39:50,204 --> 01:39:51,694
Dirty...

1329
01:40:17,498 --> 01:40:19,489
I guess we'd better get him back now.

1330
01:40:21,368 --> 01:40:22,357
Yeah.

1331
01:40:28,408 --> 01:40:32,071
All right, now, boys, get on this lift.
Come on now.

1332
01:40:32,246 --> 01:40:34,407
Let's go. All together. Come on, heave.

1333
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:41,916
- Well, there she is, sir.
- Think there's room in there to work a gun?

1334
01:40:42,089 --> 01:40:44,148
I'll show you.
Hand me the gun when I get in.

1335
01:40:44,324 --> 01:40:45,848
Okay.

1336
01:40:57,104 --> 01:40:58,696
It looks like it'll work all right.

1337
01:40:58,872 --> 01:41:02,330
The Japs are gonna get a surprise
when they come on the tail of this B-17.

1338
01:41:02,509 --> 01:41:03,806
What about the tail wheel?

1339
01:41:03,977 --> 01:41:06,571
- I can get through if you leave it down.
- Okay.

1340
01:41:06,847 --> 01:41:07,939
Got a full bomb load?

1341
01:41:08,115 --> 01:41:10,640
To the gills. Don't know
what we're gonna do with them.

1342
01:41:10,817 --> 01:41:12,580
Well, we can always drop them out.

1343
01:41:12,753 --> 01:41:13,811
- Hey, lieutenant?
- Yeah?

1344
01:41:13,987 --> 01:41:17,787
- Hand me a can of ammunition, will you?
- Coming up.

1345
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:20,222
- Lieutenant, give us a hand here.
- Sure, let's go.

1346
01:41:20,394 --> 01:41:22,362
- Pull it in again. Here we go.
- How's that?

1347
01:41:22,529 --> 01:41:23,757
That's got her.

1348
01:41:23,931 --> 01:41:26,525
Now, get a couple of planks
across here, will you?

1349
01:41:28,936 --> 01:41:32,428
- Sounds like they're getting closer.
- We'll have to be out by daylight.

1350
01:41:32,606 --> 01:41:33,903
- We will.
- It's almost 5 now.

1351
01:41:34,074 --> 01:41:35,541
Weinberg just finished Number 3.

1352
01:41:35,709 --> 01:41:39,304
Yeah, but if Rader doesn't get back
with that gasoline soon we might as well...

1353
01:41:40,047 --> 01:41:42,948
- Who is it?
- Me, sir, Peterson and Callahan.

1354
01:41:43,116 --> 01:41:44,242
We got your gas, plenty.

1355
01:41:44,418 --> 01:41:45,715
- A whole truckload.
- Good.

1356
01:41:45,886 --> 01:41:47,877
- How we gonna get it out?
- Cans and buckets.

1357
01:41:48,055 --> 01:41:51,684
- Rader's bringing a bunch of soldiers.
- Here they are now.

1358
01:41:52,759 --> 01:41:54,659
- Where do you want it?
- Right where it is.

1359
01:41:54,828 --> 01:41:57,661
- Okay, men, let's get these drums out.
- Come on, snap into it.

1360
01:41:57,831 --> 01:41:59,890
Some of you get around behind.

1361
01:42:00,901 --> 01:42:02,801
Get around behind.

1362
01:42:08,809 --> 01:42:10,800
Good work, boys. Keep them going.

1363
01:42:11,612 --> 01:42:14,581
Step on it. Don't slop it.

1364
01:42:19,086 --> 01:42:22,988
Handle those cans careful.
Don't slop it around the plane.

1365
01:42:23,156 --> 01:42:25,283
Keep them level, keep them level.

1366
01:42:27,894 --> 01:42:29,555
Come on up here.

1367
01:42:30,731 --> 01:42:32,926
Okay, sarge. Number 4 will run.

1368
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:35,466
- Fitter, get the cowling on.
- It's going on.

1369
01:42:35,636 --> 01:42:38,104
- Lieutenant, lieutenant.
- Yeah?

1370
01:42:38,272 --> 01:42:41,867
- Engines are ready.
- Good work. Thanks, kid.

1371
01:42:42,676 --> 01:42:45,338
- It's getting too close.
- Come on. Hurry it up.

1372
01:42:45,512 --> 01:42:48,538
- Don't spill it, don't spill it.
- Faster, men, with these buckets.

1373
01:42:48,715 --> 01:42:50,979
- Lieutenant Williams?
- Right here.

1374
01:42:51,551 --> 01:42:54,349
- They're coming. Through there.
- That'll have to be enough.

1375
01:42:54,521 --> 01:42:57,285
- Get everything clear to take her off.
- Yes. Hold that gas.

1376
01:42:57,457 --> 01:42:59,049
- Hold that gas.
- Drop those pails.

1377
01:42:59,226 --> 01:43:00,784
Give us a hand moving that shaft.

1378
01:43:00,961 --> 01:43:02,622
Come on. Get this stuff out of here.

1379
01:43:02,796 --> 01:43:04,525
Some get around to the front wheels.

1380
01:43:04,698 --> 01:43:06,689
Start her up
as soon as we're turned around.

1381
01:43:06,867 --> 01:43:09,165
- Winocki, get on the guns.
- Come on, Peterson.

1382
01:43:09,336 --> 01:43:11,736
Try and hold them off.
Get in, in the bomb sight.

1383
01:43:11,905 --> 01:43:13,964
Monk. You and Callahan,
siphon this gasoline.

1384
01:43:14,141 --> 01:43:16,006
If it won't start, we'll burn her.

1385
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:18,307
Come on, get on this tail.

1386
01:43:18,478 --> 01:43:21,879
Come on now, shove her.
Straight back. Shove her.

1387
01:43:22,049 --> 01:43:23,516
- Hey!
- Hold it there!

1388
01:43:23,684 --> 01:43:25,345
That's all right.
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1389
01:43:25,519 --> 01:43:27,282
Keep going.

1390
01:43:29,356 --> 01:43:31,187
Okay.

1391
01:43:32,326 --> 01:43:36,285
Weinberg, get inside to help Rader.
Okay, that's far enough. Turn her around.

1392
01:43:36,463 --> 01:43:40,763
That's enough. Hold it.
Now, take her around. Come on.

1393
01:43:40,934 --> 01:43:44,734
Hard, now. Push. Everybody.
Come on. Take her around.

1394
01:44:03,757 --> 01:44:07,386
That's enough. That's enough.
That's far enough.

1395
01:44:07,561 --> 01:44:10,530
All right, soldiers.
Get going, soldiers. Run.

1396
01:44:10,697 --> 01:44:12,221
Keep clear of the props.

1397
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:14,390
All clear. Start it, lieutenant.

1398
01:44:14,568 --> 01:44:16,536
Okay, stay clear.

1399
01:45:12,559 --> 01:45:13,992
- Get everybody out.
- Lieutenant.

1400
01:45:14,161 --> 01:45:15,492
But we've got to. Go on.

1401
01:45:15,662 --> 01:45:18,028
All right, bring over that gasoline.
Come on.

1402
01:45:18,498 --> 01:45:20,227
Come on.

1403
01:45:26,072 --> 01:45:27,801
Don't burn it.

1404
01:45:33,847 --> 01:45:37,010
Hold it, hold it, hold it!
Get out of there. Get out.

1405
01:45:37,184 --> 01:45:39,379
Keep clear. Get away.

1406
01:46:35,775 --> 01:46:37,037
Go ahead, Tex.

1407
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:38,871
Give it to her.

1408
01:47:10,577 --> 01:47:12,340
- Wheels up.
- Coming up.

1409
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:14,571
That's all right, sir.

1410
01:47:40,574 --> 01:47:43,099
It's this one here, Robbie.

1411
01:47:43,276 --> 01:47:46,336
That's easy.
How are we doing, sir?

1412
01:47:46,513 --> 01:47:49,038
For a plane they said
would never fly again, we're fine.

1413
01:47:49,215 --> 01:47:51,615
- How's our fuel consumption?
- Nothing to worry about.

1414
01:47:51,785 --> 01:47:53,480
We'll make Australia all right.

1415
01:47:54,521 --> 01:47:57,319
- Peterson picked up news on the radio.
- What's that?

1416
01:47:57,490 --> 01:47:59,754
There's a Jap invasion fleet
headed for Australia.

1417
01:47:59,926 --> 01:48:02,724
That's what they think.
Our Pacific fleet's hunting for them.

1418
01:48:02,896 --> 01:48:04,591
I wish them luck.

1419
01:48:05,999 --> 01:48:07,762
You know, Tex...

1420
01:48:07,934 --> 01:48:10,494
you're a funny-looking thing
to be flying a B-17.

1421
01:48:10,670 --> 01:48:15,937
Yeah? I hope they got P-40s in Darwin.
If they haven't, I'm gonna take up knitting.

1422
01:48:16,109 --> 01:48:19,806
I think he's the guy that shot me in the arm
just so he could get in that seat.

1423
01:48:19,980 --> 01:48:23,814
Don't do me an injustice, Bill.
I'd only shoot you to get out this seat.

1424
01:48:31,224 --> 01:48:33,317
Why don't you fellas sleep
while you can?

1425
01:48:33,493 --> 01:48:34,960
We kind of got out of the habit.

1426
01:48:37,130 --> 01:48:39,758
How about it, Joe?
Is that tail gun of yours gonna work?

1427
01:48:39,933 --> 01:48:41,332
Just wait and see.

1428
01:48:41,501 --> 01:48:43,366
Hey, sergeant,
we gonna stop at Mindanao?

1429
01:48:43,536 --> 01:48:46,664
- No, we've already passed there.
- Yeah?

1430
01:48:48,975 --> 01:48:52,570
You look like you know
how to work that gun, Callahan.

1431
01:48:52,746 --> 01:48:55,738
What do you think a Marine uses,
a bow and arrow?

1432
01:48:55,915 --> 01:48:57,849
I wouldn't put it past them.

1433
01:49:14,134 --> 01:49:16,364
Navigator to pilot.
Take a look down below.

1434
01:49:16,536 --> 01:49:18,436
On the left, right under us.

1435
01:49:26,913 --> 01:49:28,574
- Holy smoke.
- Boy, look at that.

1436
01:49:28,748 --> 01:49:31,273
Looks like we hit the jackpot.

1437
01:49:32,519 --> 01:49:35,181
- Here we go again.
- Start shooting.

1438
01:49:41,594 --> 01:49:43,152
- Those are Japs.
- What'll we do?

1439
01:49:43,329 --> 01:49:45,354
- Pull up through the clouds.
- Going up.

1440
01:49:45,532 --> 01:49:47,466
Where we going?
Give me a crack at them.

1441
01:49:47,634 --> 01:49:50,694
Hold your horses. Get below.
We're gonna start a war, not a fight.

1442
01:50:43,723 --> 01:50:45,623
Four degrees north, 124 degrees east.

1443
01:50:45,792 --> 01:50:49,626
Okay. Pilot to radio.
Did you hear that, Peterson?

1444
01:50:49,796 --> 01:50:52,663
Write it down.
Four north, 124 east. Got it?

1445
01:50:52,832 --> 01:50:54,322
Four north, 124 east.

1446
01:50:54,501 --> 01:50:56,594
Contact all air bases in this area.

1447
01:50:56,770 --> 01:50:59,364
Army, Navy, carriers,
everyone you can reach.

1448
01:50:59,539 --> 01:51:02,201
Tell them we sighted
a big Jap task force headed south.

1449
01:51:02,375 --> 01:51:03,967
- Give them that position.
- Yes, sir.

1450
01:51:04,144 --> 01:51:06,510
We're gonna play hide-and-seek
until they get here.

1451
01:53:18,244 --> 01:53:20,439
- Radio to pilot.
- Go ahead, Peterson.

1452
01:53:20,613 --> 01:53:24,276
Army bombers and Navy torpedo planes
have reached the approximate position.

1453
01:53:24,450 --> 01:53:27,010
Their formation leader's calling you
on the command set.

1454
01:53:27,186 --> 01:53:28,915
Okay.

1455
01:53:29,489 --> 01:53:31,923
Williams in 05564 talking. Go ahead.

1456
01:53:32,091 --> 01:53:35,390
Hello, Bill. This is Jack Harper.
We're looking for you. Where are you?

1457
01:53:35,561 --> 01:53:38,860
Hiya, Jack. We're at 14,000.

1458
01:53:45,738 --> 01:53:47,501
There they are.

1459
01:53:50,276 --> 01:53:52,767
Where are those Japs
you're worrying about, Bill?

1460
01:53:52,946 --> 01:53:56,177
We're roosting right over them.
Just make a turn and follow us.

1461
01:53:56,349 --> 01:53:58,613
Turning now.

1462
01:54:03,222 --> 01:54:06,282
Pilot to crew. Get ready, fellas.
This ought to be fun.

1463
01:54:06,459 --> 01:54:09,223
- Let's go calling, Tex.
- Yeah, man.

1464
01:54:33,319 --> 01:54:35,378
Now you're gonna see
what an Air Force can do.

1465
01:55:18,398 --> 01:55:21,094
- How do you want it?
- The cruiser third from the right.

1466
01:55:21,267 --> 01:55:23,667
Take her in line,
I'll pour them down their funnels.

1467
01:55:23,836 --> 01:55:27,169
- Don't waste any eggs, Popeye.
- You watch the basket, I'll lay the eggs.

1468
01:55:28,574 --> 01:55:31,008
Bomb bay doors opening.

1469
01:55:41,487 --> 01:55:43,045
Hold it.

1470
01:55:43,923 --> 01:55:46,858
- Ready to bomb.
- Hold it.

1471
01:55:48,327 --> 01:55:49,316
Slide right.

1472
01:55:51,297 --> 01:55:53,094
Left a little.

1473
01:55:53,633 --> 01:55:55,260
To the left.

1474
01:55:55,835 --> 01:55:57,063
Steady.

1475
01:56:04,811 --> 01:56:06,608
Bombs away.

1476
01:56:43,916 --> 01:56:46,146
Here they come. Weinberg to pilot.

1477
01:56:46,319 --> 01:56:49,413
About nine Japs a little above us,
around 4 o'clock.

1478
01:56:49,589 --> 01:56:52,854
Wait for them and make them count.

1479
01:57:06,572 --> 01:57:09,040
Monk, coming down, straight ahead.

1480
01:58:22,715 --> 01:58:24,342
- Did you get hit?
- Sure, I got hit.

1481
01:58:24,517 --> 01:58:26,712
- Do you need some...?
- Watch out.

1482
01:58:30,489 --> 01:58:32,923
- Did you see that?
- What do you want, a cigar?

1483
01:58:37,063 --> 01:58:38,587
They're coming in on our tail.

1484
01:58:38,764 --> 01:58:41,631
Wait for them. They don't know
we got a stinger in our tail.

1485
01:59:11,731 --> 01:59:14,894
- Which one now, Tommy?
- Let's take that carrier straight ahead.

1486
01:59:15,067 --> 01:59:17,160
Okay.

1487
01:59:29,949 --> 01:59:33,248
- What do you think of our bomber now?
- Boy, I'll take it for mine.

1488
02:00:51,297 --> 02:00:53,765
We gotta get out of here.
We just lost half our gas.

1489
02:02:17,950 --> 02:02:19,679
Attention.

1490
02:02:19,852 --> 02:02:21,183
All right, men. At ease.

1491
02:02:21,353 --> 02:02:23,480
Turn that thing off, Henson.

1492
02:02:25,558 --> 02:02:27,321
Well, gentlemen...

1493
02:02:28,527 --> 02:02:30,154
this is it.

1494
02:02:31,697 --> 02:02:33,995
This is what we've been waiting for.

1495
02:02:34,166 --> 02:02:37,101
Tonight, your target is Tokyo.

1496
02:02:37,269 --> 02:02:41,069
You're gonna play them the "Star
Spangled Banner" with two-ton bombs.

1497
02:02:41,240 --> 02:02:43,265
You've got to remember
what you've learned...

1498
02:02:43,442 --> 02:02:45,376
and follow your squadron leaders.

1499
02:02:45,544 --> 02:02:49,139
They'll get you in
and they'll get you out too.

1500
02:02:49,315 --> 02:02:51,283
Williams, you lead the first section.

1501
02:02:51,450 --> 02:02:53,350
Rader, the second.

1502
02:02:53,519 --> 02:02:55,919
Hauser will navigate
for the entire squadron...

1503
02:02:56,088 --> 02:02:59,114
and McMartin will talk to you
bombardiers before taking off.

1504
02:02:59,625 --> 02:03:01,388
Any questions?

1505
02:03:02,962 --> 02:03:07,365
All right, that's all.
Good luck to you and give them hell.

1506
02:03:18,978 --> 02:03:23,278
We shall carry the attack
against the enemy.

1507
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:27,249
We shall hit him and hit him again...

1508
02:03:27,419 --> 02:03:31,048
wherever and whenever
we can reach him.

1509
02:03:31,223 --> 02:03:34,659
For we intend to bring
this battle to him...

1510
02:03:34,827 --> 02:03:37,921
on his own home grounds.
