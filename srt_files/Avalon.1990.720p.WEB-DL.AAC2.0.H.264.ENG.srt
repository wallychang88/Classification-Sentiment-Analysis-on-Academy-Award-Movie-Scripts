1
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,937
<i>I came to America in 1914,
by way of Philadelphia.</i>

2
00:00:47,146 --> 00:00:49,114
<i>That's where I got off the boat.</i>

3
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,307
<i>And then I came to Baltimore.</i>

4
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:57,520
<i>It was the most beautiful place
you've ever seen in your life.</i>

5
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,650
<i>There were lights everywhere.
What lights they had!</i>

6
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:04,421
<i>It was a celebration of lights.</i>

7
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:07,258
<i>I thought they were for me:
"Sam was in America."</i>

8
00:01:08,267 --> 00:01:10,326
<i>Sam was in America.</i>

9
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:59,045
<i>I didn't know what holiday it was,
but there were lights.</i>

10
00:01:59,785 --> 00:02:01,377
<i>And I walked under them.</i>

11
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:04,579
<i>The sky exploded! People cheered!</i>

12
00:02:04,857 --> 00:02:07,223
<i>There were fireworks.
What a welcome it was!</i>

13
00:02:07,426 --> 00:02:09,223
<i>What a welcome!</i>

14
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,343
<i>I didn't know where my brothers were.</i>

15
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:33,814
<i>I had an address on a letter,
but when I went there, they'd moved.</i>

16
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,146
<i>I found the man
who knew the name Krichinsky.</i>

17
00:02:36,355 --> 00:02:40,052
<i>He was a little man with big shoes.
I'll never forget him.</i>

18
00:02:40,259 --> 00:02:44,821
<i>He had such big shoes!
They were brand-new, beautiful shoes.</i>

19
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,760
<i>He told me this was
how he made his living.</i>

20
00:02:47,967 --> 00:02:50,162
<i>He would break in shoes
for the wealthy.</i>

21
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:53,861
<i>Stuff them with newspaper
and walk in them.</i>

22
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:58,703
<i>I said, "What a country is this.
What a country."</i>

23
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:02,972
<i>The wealthy didn't even have
to break in their own shoes.</i>

24
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,787
<i>So this man with the shoes took me
down one street after another.</i>

25
00:03:08,988 --> 00:03:10,353
<i>We walked and walked...</i>

26
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,424
<i>and the skies would light up
and explode in a celebration.</i>

27
00:03:19,565 --> 00:03:22,090
<i>And then we came to Avalon.</i>

28
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:26,863
<i>And the man with the shoes yelled,
"Krichinsky! Krichinsky!"</i>

29
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:30,573
<i>And my four brothers looked down
and saw me.</i>

30
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:31,834
<i>"Sam!"</i>

31
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:34,813
<i>Sam.</i>

32
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:37,143
<i>Sam.</i>

33
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:49,819
And that's when I came to America.
It was the Fourth of July.

34
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:54,330
Boy, did they used to celebrate.
Big celebrations.

35
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:57,991
They closed the streets
and would celebrate through the night.

36
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:04,538
What happened to the guy
who wore the big shoes?

37
00:04:04,743 --> 00:04:07,268
The funny thing is, he did it
for another two years.

38
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:09,538
He brought his brother
into the business.

39
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:13,548
They would walk the streets, breaking
in shoes. Then he got an idea!

40
00:04:13,752 --> 00:04:15,879
Why not make shoes that fit right?

41
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:18,886
They became custom shoemakers:
The Solomon Brothers.

42
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:24,128
They made shoes, pants.
And then they were a department store.

43
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,299
But the Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

44
00:04:27,499 --> 00:04:31,799
The five Krichinsky brothers,
wallpaper hangers.

45
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:33,995
<i>And we worked and worked
and worked.</i>

46
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:36,299
<i>Except Gabriel didn't work.</i>

47
00:04:36,508 --> 00:04:40,968
<i>Gabriel used to point a lot.
"There's a crease, it's not straight."</i>

48
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,981
He was the inspector.
He was the inspector.

49
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,718
How did you all get
to be wallpaper hangers?

50
00:04:51,757 --> 00:04:53,520
It was your grandfather William.

51
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:56,661
He came to America first
and worked in the department store...

52
00:04:56,862 --> 00:05:00,662
where they sold wallpaper
and do wallpaper hanging for people.

53
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:02,561
So he became a wallpaper hanger.

54
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,399
And as each brother came over,
we all became wallpaper hangers.

55
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:12,299
But on the weekend, we made music.

56
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:13,773
What music it was!

57
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,444
<i>We liked American music.
We were very popular ourselves.</i>

58
00:05:43,809 --> 00:05:44,809
<i>One night...</i>

59
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,008
<i>I looked across the floor
and I saw...</i>

60
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:52,546
<i>this young, lovely girl.</i>

61
00:05:54,019 --> 00:05:57,546
<i>I wasn't handsome,
and I didn't have a beautiful body.</i>

62
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,157
<i>But when I touched a woman...</i>

63
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,521
<i>they fell in love with me.</i>

64
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:43,660
<i>The family! How it grew.
The wives, the kids.</i>

65
00:06:43,869 --> 00:06:46,702
<i>Krichinskys everywhere, everywhere.</i>

66
00:06:47,006 --> 00:06:50,567
<i>So we had the family-circle meetings.</i>

67
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,846
<i>We put money in the hat to bring over
the cousins, the aunts, the uncles.</i>

68
00:06:56,081 --> 00:07:00,609
<i>And then, out of the blue,
William gets the flu.</i>

69
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,187
<i>It was a terrible epidemic,
the flu of 1919.</i>

70
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,982
<i>Thousands died.</i>

71
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,658
<i>William died.</i>

72
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,024
<i>He was a young man.
He left three kids.</i>

73
00:07:12,664 --> 00:07:15,497
Sam, how many times do we
have to hear this story?

74
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,965
We know this story.
We heard it before.

75
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,298
If we don't tell them, they don't know.
Last year, Bill died.

76
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,101
Was very warm last year
when Bill died.

77
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:26,436
How many times
do we have to hear this?

78
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:28,442
The children know this story.

79
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:30,512
I'm telling them about
when I came here.

80
00:07:30,716 --> 00:07:33,412
Yeah, we know about it.
We all heard it before.

81
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,645
Dad, you want to cut the turkey,
or do you want me to?

82
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:40,052
I wanted to tell them about
when my father came here.

83
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:43,251
You have plenty of time
to talk about your father.

84
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:45,963
Sorry we're late.

85
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:50,625
Another minute, we would've cut the
turkey without you and started to eat.

86
00:07:51,403 --> 00:07:54,031
To cut the turkey without me present?

87
00:07:54,239 --> 00:07:55,638
We leave the house!

88
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,674
- We didn't cut the turkey.
- I heard the turkey was cut.

89
00:07:58,877 --> 00:08:01,038
I was just talking
about when Bill died.

90
00:08:01,246 --> 00:08:02,474
Thank God we are late.

91
00:08:03,582 --> 00:08:07,018
I don't understand this holiday.
I'll never understand it.

92
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:10,677
- What's not to understand?
- Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving.

93
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:12,584
We're giving thanks to who?

94
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:14,725
You're giving thanks
for what you have.

95
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,191
How many times do we have
to go through this?

96
00:08:17,396 --> 00:08:21,423
All I'm saying is, we had to get
the turkey and kill it to give thanks.

97
00:08:21,633 --> 00:08:24,966
If it wasn't this holiday,
we wouldn't have turkey.

98
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:29,038
I don't eat turkey the rest
of the year. Why do I have to now?

99
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,675
Mom, don't give thanks, okay?

100
00:08:31,877 --> 00:08:34,505
Time to tell the kids
when my father came to America.

101
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,408
Can't it wait till later?

102
00:08:36,882 --> 00:08:38,440
They should hear this story.

103
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,641
Eva, this is very tender.

104
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,378
Of course it is.
It's a beautiful bird.

105
00:08:43,589 --> 00:08:47,184
The turkey was in the basement alive.
She killed it.

106
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,827
We brought my father over in '25.

107
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,364
- '25?
- William died in 1919. '25.

108
00:08:56,568 --> 00:08:58,900
'25? It was later than '25!

109
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,629
He came the same year
we brought Bill and Edith.

110
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,001
Bill and Edith came after!

111
00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:05,733
- After?
- Yeah, after.

112
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,571
It was '26.

113
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,543
What's the difference?
He came to America, right?

114
00:09:10,749 --> 00:09:13,843
It's a big difference
between '25 and '26.

115
00:09:14,052 --> 00:09:16,316
One is '25 and the other is '26.

116
00:09:18,023 --> 00:09:22,960
All's I'm saying is,
who cares if it was '25 or '26?

117
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:27,531
Jules, Jules, if you stop remembering,
you forget.

118
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,227
It was '26.

119
00:09:30,435 --> 00:09:33,131
I remember the excitement
when you went to meet him.

120
00:09:33,338 --> 00:09:36,796
<i>Finally, the father was coming.
We saved the money and sent it to him.</i>

121
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,034
<i>The whole family went to the border...</i>

122
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:41,838
<i>Jules, you were just a little kid.</i>

123
00:09:42,047 --> 00:09:43,344
<i>It was cold!</i>

124
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,778
<i>We went to the marketplace.
It was cold. It was cold.</i>

125
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:51,012
What are you talking about,
it was cold? It was late May.

126
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,418
May? I remember cold.

127
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,458
No, you're thinking of when
Irene was getting married.

128
00:09:56,662 --> 00:10:00,996
It was bitter cold then. No,
it was May 17 when your father came.

129
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,225
Anyway, we went, the whole family.

130
00:10:03,435 --> 00:10:05,232
<i>The brothers, the wives, the kids.</i>

131
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:08,133
<i>I didn't go,
and all the kids didn't go.</i>

132
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,773
We waited in the house.

133
00:10:09,975 --> 00:10:13,877
There was such excitement.
The father, the father was coming.

134
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,048
All I ever heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."

135
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:20,480
The head of the family.
I pictured this big, powerful man.

136
00:10:20,686 --> 00:10:23,450
<i>All I'd heard was,
"Wait until the father comes."</i>

137
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,390
<i>The father's word when he speaks...</i>

138
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,152
<i>So I'm there. I see him.</i>

139
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:33,062
<i>He's shorter than me, and I'm only 6.</i>

140
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,892
<i>He was this little...</i>

141
00:10:39,738 --> 00:10:42,798
He was a little, little man.

142
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,268
I never said he was big.

143
00:10:46,478 --> 00:10:48,878
But I said he was the father.

144
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:50,776
From the day...

145
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,976
<i>From the day he came to America,
he never had to work.</i>

146
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:59,146
<i>Not a day in his life.
Each of us would give him 10 percent.</i>

147
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,848
<i>Ten percent?</i>

148
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,161
<i>Right? Right? Yeah.</i>

149
00:11:05,664 --> 00:11:07,461
<i>Ten percent. He was the father.</i>

150
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,698
<i>He never drank water.</i>

151
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,599
The entire time he was in America,
from the day he came...

152
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:18,332
he drank whiskey or seltzer water.

153
00:11:18,543 --> 00:11:20,807
He never drank water.

154
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,982
And boy, could he drink!

155
00:11:27,119 --> 00:11:30,145
What was that stuff called
he always used to drink?

156
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:32,687
Slivovitz. Slivovitz.

157
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,217
He used to call it "Block and Fall."

158
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:39,795
You have one drink of that,
you walk one block and you fall!

159
00:11:39,998 --> 00:11:41,397
If you have one drink...

160
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,694
It's such a strong drink,
it burned the gums out.

161
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,633
He was funny. He was funny.
Very, very, very funny.

162
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,500
How often did he drink water?

163
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:52,635
Never, ever touched it.
How many times...?

164
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:55,506
I'm sitting across from you,
you can't hear it?

165
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,580
He never drank water!

166
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,810
That means he doesn't drink.
I got it.

167
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,955
You asked me, I told you.
Now I'm telling you some more.

168
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,625
Occasionally, maybe,
he had some water.

169
00:12:10,929 --> 00:12:12,897
He never drank water.

170
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:14,565
So he didn't like it.

171
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,400
- He didn't like water.
- How many times?

172
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:20,833
Hymie, Gabriel, Jules.

173
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,463
Are aunts kids
before they become aunts?

174
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:52,034
Everybody's a kid
before they become an aunt.

175
00:12:52,237 --> 00:12:55,297
They are?
I thought they just popped out.

176
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,213
I've been thinking about it.

177
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,213
It's a good time
we open our own business.

178
00:13:06,418 --> 00:13:08,818
Open our own business?
What, are you kidding?

179
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,510
Think of the risk involved.

180
00:13:10,722 --> 00:13:13,452
We got good routes.
Why should we gamble?

181
00:13:13,658 --> 00:13:16,752
It's perfect.
We got built-in customers.

182
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,830
We open our own place. We keep
the routes, but switch people to us.

183
00:13:21,032 --> 00:13:24,866
We sell the same goods,
except the money goes in our pockets.

184
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,901
You don't think
Simmons will sit still?

185
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:29,471
We open our own place,
he'll put someone on our routes.

186
00:13:29,674 --> 00:13:32,871
We'll hold on to the customers.
They like us, trust us.

187
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,172
We won't hold on to everybody.
We'll lose customers.

188
00:13:36,381 --> 00:13:39,316
This is less dollars,
and we got to find new customers.

189
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,951
The war is over, right?

190
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,919
There's lots of people with lots
of money. It's a good time to gamble.

191
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:46,357
Dessert!

192
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,717
I hear dessert?

193
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,485
I hear dessert.

194
00:13:51,329 --> 00:13:52,694
Dessert.

195
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:55,427
Bring me dessert.

196
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:57,261
The kids aren't having dessert?

197
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:01,303
My grandmother is grandmother to me,
but she's not grandmother to Teddy.

198
00:14:01,506 --> 00:14:03,269
- Yes, right.
- Then what is she?

199
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:05,136
She's Teddy's great-aunt.

200
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:06,935
There are aunts and great-aunts?

201
00:14:07,145 --> 00:14:11,241
What's the difference between
a regular aunt and a great-aunt?

202
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:13,418
They're older. That's the difference.

203
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:15,313
It's not because they're older.

204
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:19,183
Because then someday,
all aunts would be great-aunts.

205
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,053
But why are great-aunts
just called great-aunts?

206
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,855
Why not "good aunts" or
"fantastic aunts" or "terrible aunts"?

207
00:14:26,064 --> 00:14:30,160
No. It doesn't have anything to do
with what kind of person they are.

208
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:34,134
It's got to do with great.
You know, they're great, older.

209
00:14:34,339 --> 00:14:37,433
What about those red ants that
crawl around and bite you?

210
00:14:37,642 --> 00:14:40,338
No, no, no. That's A-N-T.

211
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:41,979
Ant.

212
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:45,815
What's a first cousin, twice removed?

213
00:14:47,452 --> 00:14:49,579
I have absolutely no idea.

214
00:14:56,695 --> 00:14:59,289
I'm going selling with my dad today.

215
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,329
You're not going to school?

216
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,433
Christmas holidays. No school.

217
00:15:03,635 --> 00:15:05,227
Christmas holiday.

218
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,707
- Keep your nose clean.
- Yeah.

219
00:15:15,881 --> 00:15:18,406
How come you didn't become
a wallpaper hanger like Sam?

220
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:21,051
Well, Sam always had this idea...

221
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:25,053
that doing manual labor
had no dignity, but selling...

222
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,226
"Selling was security," he said.

223
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:31,020
No matter where you are
or what you're selling...

224
00:15:31,229 --> 00:15:32,719
you can always make a living.

225
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,996
- Can you sell anything?
- Anything. I can sell anything.

226
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:40,768
See, it's all a question of
being able to talk to people.

227
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:43,338
The product?
It doesn't make any difference.

228
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:45,772
You're selling yourself.

229
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:48,878
Can you sell model trains?

230
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:52,149
- As many as they can make.
- Can you sell toothbrushes?

231
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,183
To as many people as have teeth.

232
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,582
Quick! See that car?
What car is that?

233
00:15:57,789 --> 00:15:58,983
Chrysler!

234
00:15:59,558 --> 00:16:01,389
The one over there on the right?

235
00:16:01,726 --> 00:16:03,785
- Nash!
- Pretty good.

236
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,602
Give me your money.

237
00:17:22,807 --> 00:17:25,298
- What's that?
- Give me your money.

238
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:28,138
Are you kidding me?

239
00:17:28,346 --> 00:17:31,179
No, I'm not kidding you.
Give me your money.

240
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,219
What, are you robbing me?
With all these houses around?

241
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,116
Yeah, I'm robbing you.

242
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,139
Get help.

243
00:18:05,383 --> 00:18:07,317
I can't play.

244
00:18:08,553 --> 00:18:10,111
I can't play.

245
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:14,653
<i>I never learned to play the piano.</i>

246
00:18:16,127 --> 00:18:17,127
<i>I never learned.</i>

247
00:18:21,132 --> 00:18:22,622
I said, I never learned.

248
00:18:24,135 --> 00:18:25,135
Jules!

249
00:18:28,473 --> 00:18:31,465
I can't. I can't play the piano.

250
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:33,376
I can't play.

251
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,351
No, I can't.
I can't play the piano.

252
00:18:50,361 --> 00:18:51,361
See!

253
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:55,363
He can't play, but he can learn!

254
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:03,506
<i>I can't play.</i>

255
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,654
<i>That's the problem with collecting.</i>

256
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:23,384
<i>I know that's got to be
a problem with collecting.</i>

257
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,687
<i>It's unheard of.</i>

258
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:26,625
<i>When you have lots of money...</i>

259
00:19:26,831 --> 00:19:30,323
It's unheard of to stab somebody
and take the money.

260
00:19:30,535 --> 00:19:31,900
I never heard of it.

261
00:19:32,103 --> 00:19:34,867
I don't want to know about it.
Not like in the old days.

262
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:38,236
When they know you got lots of money,
somebody wants the money.

263
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,535
We know that.

264
00:19:39,744 --> 00:19:41,473
We know that. But who wants it?

265
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,082
It's not like it used to be!
A man can't walk in the street?

266
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:49,845
Never, never, never.
It's the money that's the problem.

267
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:53,114
- You're right.
- Somebody tries to kill...

268
00:19:53,324 --> 00:19:56,157
Somebody tries to kill my boy
just for money.

269
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,125
- That's not good. That's not good!
- It's the money.

270
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:00,797
- It's not good.
- No good.

271
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,058
Money, money, money, that's it.

272
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:07,705
- That's the whole problem. Money.
- Money.

273
00:20:45,977 --> 00:20:48,502
When I was a little younger
than you...

274
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,208
I used to think
the world was made up...

275
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,941
of big people and little people.

276
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,887
And that's the way
it would always stay.

277
00:20:58,656 --> 00:21:01,784
And then I always wondered
why sinks were too high.

278
00:21:01,993 --> 00:21:06,157
You had to climb up to wash your face.
Cupboards, too high.

279
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:09,458
The hole in the toilet was too big.

280
00:21:09,667 --> 00:21:11,828
Nothing was made for us.

281
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:16,397
It's just a world of big people
and little people.

282
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:19,202
You never got any older...

283
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,776
and nobody ever died.

284
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:24,007
<i>Michael!</i>

285
00:21:24,716 --> 00:21:25,910
Michael.

286
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:32,115
I talked to the doctor.
Your father's gonna be all right.

287
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:37,220
- There, you got it?
- Yeah, yeah. Hold it.

288
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:39,390
What is it? What is it?

289
00:21:39,597 --> 00:21:41,360
What could it be? It's so big.

290
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,194
- It's a holiday gift.
- What is it?

291
00:21:44,402 --> 00:21:45,699
What is it? What is it?

292
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,065
It's a surprise. Wait and see.

293
00:21:48,273 --> 00:21:53,210
The family circle voted and decided
to get you a holiday get-well gift.

294
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,571
For me?

295
00:21:57,982 --> 00:21:59,950
You didn't! You didn't!

296
00:22:12,263 --> 00:22:13,525
So, what is this?

297
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:16,163
A television.

298
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,588
That's television.
You can only watch for so long.

299
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:51,231
To me, it doesn't have
what a radio has.

300
00:22:52,837 --> 00:22:54,236
Yes, it does.

301
00:22:57,408 --> 00:22:59,137
Anybody want coffee?

302
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,602
Yes.

303
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,546
Nice picture?

304
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,312
Beautiful picture.

305
00:23:18,062 --> 00:23:19,529
Never happened.

306
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:24,492
In the old country, never heard of
stabbing someone to take their money.

307
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:26,864
Never happened.

308
00:23:27,071 --> 00:23:29,699
You're right.
But the government would kill you.

309
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:33,707
Would take your money,
your property, whatever you had.

310
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:36,539
You know what you have to do?
Be like in Westerns.

311
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,376
Have a stagecoach
and the shotgun when you collect.

312
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,553
That's what they had in the Wild West,
because of outlaws.

313
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,746
Yeah, that's what you need.
There's always robbers.

314
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:49,757
What was the movie we saw with
the stagecoach? A very good movie.

315
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,623
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
- The movie had a stagecoach.

316
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:54,855
<i>- Stagecoach.</i>
- Very active movie.

317
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:58,194
John Wayne, he was an outlaw
but was not an outlaw.

318
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,065
What was the movie called
with the stagecoach?

319
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:02,272
<i>Stagecoach.</i>

320
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:05,376
That's what I'm saying,
with the stagecoach.

321
00:24:05,743 --> 00:24:08,143
<i>- Stagecoach.
- Stagecoach?</i>

322
00:24:09,647 --> 00:24:12,207
I saw a nice little shop
off Helen's Market...

323
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:15,241
on the southeast corner.

324
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,581
Supposing we do do this, what are
we selling? Same things we sell now?

325
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,316
Yeah, only for less
than running the routes.

326
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,486
Pots and pans?

327
00:24:25,329 --> 00:24:27,593
Pots, pans,
vacuum cleaners, everything.

328
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,063
The time is right
we get out on our own.

329
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,759
We don't have enough money.
Now is not right.

330
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,234
- Ann, please.
- All right.

331
00:24:36,507 --> 00:24:39,499
The problem is, Jules,
we never have privacy.

332
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,407
Everybody's on top of everybody.
We need our own place.

333
00:24:43,614 --> 00:24:45,912
And we'll get it.
But Izzy's right.

334
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:49,484
This is the time for us to use
our savings for our own business.

335
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:52,485
We can get off the street
and try to make a go of it.

336
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,590
Well, I know that's the best thing.

337
00:24:54,792 --> 00:24:57,283
I just can't promise
I'm gonna remain sane.

338
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,790
You put on a little sweater.

339
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:04,801
Yeah, be sure to take small steps.
There's a little wind.

340
00:25:05,002 --> 00:25:07,596
Michael! Forgot your lunch money.

341
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,067
Toss it.

342
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:15,135
Ann! Do we leave at 10:30?

343
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,971
Yeah, that'll be fine!
I have to be back at 1:00.

344
00:25:18,182 --> 00:25:20,207
I have to go to the doctor's
with Jules.

345
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:24,052
You're not driving, are you?

346
00:25:24,255 --> 00:25:27,281
- No, I'm still taking the lessons.
- Thank God.

347
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:34,131
"Can" is whether you're capable
of doing something.

348
00:25:34,332 --> 00:25:36,823
"May" is asking for permission.

349
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,861
- Yes, Michael?
- Can I go to the bathroom?

350
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,563
Michael, do you want
to repeat that question?

351
00:25:43,774 --> 00:25:45,833
No, I'm going
to be made an example of.

352
00:25:46,043 --> 00:25:47,043
Michael.

353
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:51,711
I said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

354
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:53,884
You can, but you may not.

355
00:25:54,218 --> 00:25:56,152
Well, can I or can't I?

356
00:25:56,521 --> 00:26:00,321
I don't think you've been paying
attention, have you, Michael Kaye?

357
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:01,719
Yes, I have.

358
00:26:01,926 --> 00:26:04,326
So how would you
rephrase the question?

359
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,993
Can I please go to the bathroom?

360
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,260
Children.

361
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:15,098
Michael Kaye, why don't you just
spend some time in the hallway...

362
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:18,901
until you've learned the difference
between "can" and "may."

363
00:26:20,411 --> 00:26:23,744
When you've learned the difference,
then you may come back in.

364
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,915
I have to go to the bathroom,
but I'm afraid to ask.

365
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:33,989
Now, does anyone know the difference
between "can" and "may"?

366
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:43,200
Young man, have you learned the
difference between "may" and "can"?

367
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:44,968
Not yet.

368
00:26:45,169 --> 00:26:48,104
You stay out there
until you've learned the difference.

369
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,274
Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

370
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:04,650
Well? Are you ready
to rejoin the class, Michael?

371
00:27:05,022 --> 00:27:06,148
Yes, Mrs. Parkes.

372
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:09,554
And what's the difference
between "may" and "can"?

373
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:14,188
Give me a little more time.

374
00:27:17,501 --> 00:27:20,834
Young man, what are you doing
in the hallway?

375
00:27:21,072 --> 00:27:23,404
Learning the difference
between "may" and "can."

376
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,803
How long do you think it would take?

377
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,989
Hello?

378
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,680
Is this Mr. Kaye?

379
00:27:40,891 --> 00:27:43,018
His father, Mr. Krichinsky.

380
00:27:44,428 --> 00:27:47,420
No, he's at the doctor's,
but he's fine. Who is this?

381
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,429
This is Mr. Dunn,
the principal of Michael's school.

382
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,364
We seem to have a problem.

383
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,670
Is he sick?

384
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,496
We seem to have a problem
between "may" and "can."

385
00:27:57,942 --> 00:27:59,273
What's the problem?

386
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:01,240
That's the lesson they were learning.

387
00:28:01,445 --> 00:28:03,811
Michael asked
if he could go to the bathroom.

388
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:06,276
He said, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

389
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:09,385
The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

390
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:12,283
What's the problem?
He asked to go to the bathroom.

391
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,118
He asked, but he asked incorrectly.

392
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:17,954
- Did he raise his hand?
- Yes, he did.

393
00:28:18,162 --> 00:28:21,859
But the point is, it was
a lesson about "may" and "can."

394
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:25,467
Okay, it's fine with me.
So, what's the problem?

395
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,797
He asked, "Can I go to the bathroom?"

396
00:28:28,005 --> 00:28:31,566
The teacher said,
"You can, but you may not."

397
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,234
That's confusing to the kid,
because you're saying, "You can"...

398
00:28:35,446 --> 00:28:38,381
and then you say,
"You can, but you can't."

399
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,714
You don't understand the subtleties...

400
00:28:40,918 --> 00:28:43,978
of the English language,
Mr. Krichinsky.

401
00:28:44,588 --> 00:28:47,421
This English, it's very difficult.

402
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:50,822
I never realized
how difficult English is.

403
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:54,631
"May" or "can."
You can, but you may not.

404
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:56,493
We've come a long way.

405
00:28:56,701 --> 00:29:00,933
In the old days, if you had to pee,
you peed on a tree.

406
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:04,869
There's no "may" or "can."
That's progress for you.

407
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,441
My God.

408
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,785
Hon?

409
00:29:25,129 --> 00:29:26,187
I got it.

410
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:27,758
The store...

411
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:29,766
televisions.

412
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:32,094
Wall-to-wall televisions.

413
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:35,397
We'll sell more of them.
How will we sell more of them?

414
00:29:35,606 --> 00:29:37,073
We'll sell them cheaper.

415
00:29:37,274 --> 00:29:41,142
Televisions, televisions,
from one end of the shop to the other.

416
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:43,404
Nothing but televisions.

417
00:29:57,928 --> 00:30:00,226
I think something's about to happen.

418
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:02,831
Seems like the humming's getting less.

419
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:05,433
That's when something's
about to happen.

420
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:08,366
Seems like it's humming
the same hum to me.

421
00:30:10,808 --> 00:30:14,403
You better hope they start getting
some more interesting programs.

422
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:25,822
See, I told you something
was going to happen.

423
00:30:26,023 --> 00:30:27,684
It's <i>Howdy Doody.</i>

424
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,955
We're getting ahead of ourselves
with this television.

425
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:35,030
Why don't we add some linoleums,
toasters, pots and pans, brooms.

426
00:30:35,232 --> 00:30:37,826
Get a little foot traffic
in here, you know?

427
00:30:38,035 --> 00:30:39,593
Maybe that'll help.

428
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:42,696
Why are they not coming in here?

429
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:54,043
<i>Electronic equipment!</i>

430
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:56,651
<i>Here's adventure!</i>

431
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,085
<i>And now let's return</i>
<i>to</i> Westinghouse Studio One.

432
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,624
<i>And</i> Letter from Cairo.

433
00:31:03,828 --> 00:31:05,955
<i>- Fighting for law
and order, captain...</i>

434
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,154
<i>Here's adventure.</i>

435
00:31:08,365 --> 00:31:10,094
<i>Here's romance.</i>

436
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:14,168
<i>Mr. L-magination.</i>

437
00:31:14,371 --> 00:31:16,362
<i>The Cisco Kid.</i>

438
00:31:18,108 --> 00:31:21,566
<i>- Henry Aldrich!
- Coming, Mother.</i>

439
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,111
<i>The Colgate Comedy Hour.</i>

440
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,976
<i>Say the secret word for $100.</i>

441
00:31:26,183 --> 00:31:29,277
<i>It's a common word for something
you find around the house.</i>

442
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,089
<i>Well, well, well.
Good evening.</i>

443
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:38,591
<i>It is Wednesday night again,
and I'm back on television.</i>

444
00:31:38,796 --> 00:31:40,559
<i>- Your Hit Parade.</i>

445
00:31:41,632 --> 00:31:45,591
<i>Time now to enjoy</i> What's My Line?

446
00:31:48,739 --> 00:31:51,640
The George Burns
and Gracie Allen Show.

447
00:31:59,717 --> 00:32:02,015
- Well, what does it mean?
- What?

448
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:05,586
- What does it mean, the suburbs?
- It's just a nicer place to live.

449
00:32:05,789 --> 00:32:07,848
That's what it means? A nicer place?

450
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:11,516
Yes, it's nicer.
It's got lawns and big trees.

451
00:32:12,363 --> 00:32:15,264
Uncle Izzy and Teddy and everyone,
they'll be there too?

452
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,990
In one house in the suburbs?

453
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,499
God, please be careful!
It's a very old piece.

454
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:22,433
- Yes, ma'am. We've got it.
- In one house?

455
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,835
No, Michael, it's gonna be the same.

456
00:32:25,042 --> 00:32:27,237
Your grandparents will live
in our house.

457
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:30,242
We'll all live near each other.
Please don't distract me.

458
00:32:30,447 --> 00:32:34,076
It's gonna rain, I got furniture
in the street, I'm gonna panic.

459
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:42,853
Aunt Dottie, Aunt Dottie!
Is this a good thing that's happening?

460
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,060
What?

461
00:32:44,261 --> 00:32:47,094
Is this a good thing,
going to the suburbs?

462
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:50,859
- Am I gonna like it there?
- You kids are gonna love it.

463
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,702
We've been here forever.

464
00:32:55,906 --> 00:32:58,636
We're even gonna have
to go to a new school.

465
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,102
You ever been in the suburbs?

466
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,679
I never even heard of the suburbs
until this thing happened.

467
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:07,314
Wait a minute.
Where you running with that?

468
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:09,145
- Wait a minute.
- Ma, they'll wrap it.

469
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:12,413
- No, no. We take this in the car.
- It'll be wrapped.

470
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,353
No, no. We take it in the car.

471
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:18,858
The truck hits a bump,
anything could happen.

472
00:33:29,206 --> 00:33:30,673
Okay, we're all set.

473
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:34,708
I remember Michael learned
how to walk right here.

474
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:38,780
Held on to the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

475
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:40,814
He went right to your room.

476
00:33:41,585 --> 00:33:44,679
Yeah, I remember.
What was he? A year old?

477
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:47,186
No, no, not a year.

478
00:33:47,391 --> 00:33:48,391
Nine months.

479
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:52,688
Held the sofa,
and he took his first steps.

480
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:55,762
Nine months.

481
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,832
What's wrong, Pop?

482
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:06,968
I don't know, I don't know.

483
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,706
I get nervous about making a change.

484
00:34:10,914 --> 00:34:13,849
What are you talking about?
You came to America.

485
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,246
We're just going to the suburbs.

486
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,780
I came to America in 1914...

487
00:34:20,624 --> 00:34:22,182
but I was a young man.

488
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:26,487
Come on, Dad.

489
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,858
What about the house?
You saw the house.

490
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:31,000
Forest Park area. It's beautiful.

491
00:34:31,201 --> 00:34:34,170
We're gonna have more room
for the whole family.

492
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:39,137
We're getting farther
and farther away from Avalon.

493
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:43,140
I think I'm getting
too old for change.

494
00:34:56,593 --> 00:35:00,085
<i>- Bill, are you hurt?
- Not a bit. Cut me loose.</i>

495
00:35:01,932 --> 00:35:04,423
No, Sam, don't feed the dog
from the table.

496
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,102
He likes meat.

497
00:35:06,303 --> 00:35:09,636
Don't give him big pieces.
He has a small throat.

498
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,712
- What's wrong with the green beans?
- I don't like green beans.

499
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:18,108
Since when you don't like green beans?

500
00:35:18,315 --> 00:35:20,044
Never. I never eat green beans.

501
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:24,949
I cannot believe we argue over the dog
and the green beans every meal.

502
00:35:25,155 --> 00:35:27,817
Green beans and the dog.
Like it's the first time.

503
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,050
Constantly you argue
about the same thing.

504
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,319
It's not an argument,
it's dinner talk.

505
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:34,929
Dad, this goes on all the time.

506
00:35:35,132 --> 00:35:36,997
Whether it's green beans
or feeding Nimo...

507
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:39,761
constantly you two
have a problem at dinner.

508
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:42,063
- Constantly?
- Yeah. How about drinks?

509
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:44,297
Mom says you can't mix drinks.

510
00:35:44,508 --> 00:35:46,806
The mixes he makes
is not a good drink.

511
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,001
Let's not get into
the drinks thing now.

512
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:52,671
What are you talking about?
I take the juice from the pears...

513
00:35:52,883 --> 00:35:55,010
mix it with Coca-Cola.
It's a good drink.

514
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,313
Please. You're going to
make me sick with this.

515
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,024
Sam, I said don't feed the dog
from the table.

516
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:03,226
My God.

517
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:06,787
We're thinking of keeping the store
open a couple nights until 9.

518
00:36:06,997 --> 00:36:08,157
Do you have to?

519
00:36:08,365 --> 00:36:12,927
If we want to stay competitive.
The other shops stay open later.

520
00:36:13,137 --> 00:36:15,071
He's gonna choke to death.

521
00:36:15,272 --> 00:36:18,571
One night we look under the table,
the dog will be dead.

522
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:23,372
I spoke to Izzy about the family
meeting that's supposed to be here.

523
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:26,344
Some of the brothers feel
it's too far to go.

524
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:27,947
Too far?

525
00:36:28,152 --> 00:36:32,213
How far can it be? They get on
Rogers over the Liberty Heights.

526
00:36:32,422 --> 00:36:33,422
We know how to go.

527
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,721
Why Rogers? You take Greenspring.
There's no light.

528
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:38,224
It's a bottleneck.

529
00:36:38,428 --> 00:36:39,428
- It's not.
- It is.

530
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,654
It's not!

531
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:43,560
It's a bottleneck.
I say you take Rogers.

532
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:47,396
To go to Rogers, he's got to go up
Park Circle. Why Rogers?

533
00:36:47,604 --> 00:36:52,303
The question is not which way they'll
come. They think it is too far.

534
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,581
What do you want? You want me to
tell them to move out?

535
00:37:32,783 --> 00:37:35,217
I don't want you to tell them
to move out.

536
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:39,082
I just was expressing a feeling
that maybe, you know...

537
00:37:39,289 --> 00:37:42,520
you can get them their own place
and chip in with the rent.

538
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:45,092
Their own place? Where would
the money come from?

539
00:37:45,295 --> 00:37:47,525
I don't have the money yet.
They don't either.

540
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:50,291
I know, I just feel...

541
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,434
there's always
somebody watching over me.

542
00:37:52,636 --> 00:37:55,434
Every time I do something,
I feel like somebody's...

543
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,267
thinking that they
could do it better.

544
00:37:58,475 --> 00:38:00,204
What? I don't know.

545
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:03,743
I put something down, I like how
it looks on the coffee table...

546
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:05,938
I come back and it's moved.

547
00:38:06,149 --> 00:38:07,343
You want me to talk to her?

548
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:11,681
I'd like to put something down,
and have it there when I return.

549
00:38:12,522 --> 00:38:14,183
Do you want me to talk to her?
I will.

550
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,791
I'll talk to her again and again,
but it doesn't do any good.

551
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:18,623
You know her. She's like an enigma.

552
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:20,854
I feel like I'm still with
my mom and dad.

553
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:25,057
I'd like to feel like this is my home.
Feel like the mom in my own house.

554
00:38:25,269 --> 00:38:28,466
I understand. I understand that.

555
00:38:28,672 --> 00:38:32,233
I go out and buy what I consider to be
an attractive outfit.

556
00:38:32,442 --> 00:38:36,970
I come home, "No, it's too tight here.
The material's not becoming to you.

557
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,614
It looks too heavy for summer."
Or whatever it is.

558
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:41,841
She speaks her mind.
She's got opinions.

559
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:45,783
I'd like to feel good about what I buy
for my house or myself.

560
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:48,150
Don't let her make you feel bad.

561
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:49,620
How can I help it?

562
00:38:49,826 --> 00:38:51,066
- Put her in her place.
- Right.

563
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,752
You gotta do that sometimes.

564
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,227
- I don't know.
- You gotta put her in her place.

565
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:58,196
I just would like to feel like
I live in my house.

566
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,892
You do. You live here.

567
00:39:00,103 --> 00:39:02,333
What do you want from me?
I don't know what to do.

568
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:04,439
I know. I'm just...

569
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,108
talking.

570
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:21,951
I got it!

571
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:24,219
Hi, Eva.

572
00:39:24,594 --> 00:39:26,687
- Hi, Nimo.
- Where's your mother?

573
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,558
She's in the dining room.

574
00:39:28,765 --> 00:39:30,528
Come on, let's play a game.
Got it.

575
00:39:33,971 --> 00:39:35,871
You're not going to believe this.

576
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:37,734
I got a call.

577
00:39:37,941 --> 00:39:42,469
American Red Cross.
My brother's alive in Europe.

578
00:39:43,046 --> 00:39:44,046
What?

579
00:39:44,181 --> 00:39:47,014
I can't believe it.
I have to sit down.

580
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:52,279
I need something to drink.
I ran to get here.

581
00:39:52,489 --> 00:39:53,922
I'll get you some lemonade.

582
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,422
It's too sweet. Not too sweet.

583
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:59,356
My heart. My heart is running.

584
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,758
So, Ma, what happened?

585
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:03,865
Well, I don't know exactly.

586
00:40:05,235 --> 00:40:07,362
He was in a concentration camp.

587
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,698
He lived through
the concentration camp.

588
00:40:09,906 --> 00:40:13,069
They found him, but I don't know.

589
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:14,469
I don't know...

590
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,044
how he lived through it.
I don't know.

591
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:21,843
I never saw him. I heard about him
from letters.

592
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:25,283
When I came to this country,
he wasn't born.

593
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:28,083
And when he was old enough to come...

594
00:40:28,291 --> 00:40:32,159
he wouldn't leave my father.
No, he was blind and dying.

595
00:40:32,362 --> 00:40:34,227
And then the war started.

596
00:40:34,431 --> 00:40:36,228
So where is your brother now?

597
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:39,561
I don't know. With refugees.

598
00:40:39,803 --> 00:40:41,998
But now they found me...

599
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:46,608
they make plans for him
to come to America.

600
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,573
It's 4-1.

601
00:40:53,316 --> 00:40:55,716
And after the concentration camp...

602
00:40:55,919 --> 00:40:59,013
he's put in a camp
with the displaced people.

603
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:01,554
Now he says he has a sister
in Baltimore...

604
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:05,319
but he can't remember
my married name: Krichinsky.

605
00:41:05,529 --> 00:41:08,794
Doesn't have his letters anymore.
They were all destroyed.

606
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:11,763
He knows the name's Russian,
not Polish.

607
00:41:11,968 --> 00:41:15,904
It's a Y, not an I,
but he can't remember the name.

608
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:19,769
I cannot imagine having a brother
I've never seen.

609
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,735
Never seen.

610
00:41:21,945 --> 00:41:23,776
Thought was dead.

611
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:27,411
All right, Michael.
Give me your best shot.

612
00:41:32,856 --> 00:41:34,448
That's an out.

613
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,319
My God.

614
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:39,361
Bees!

615
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:40,860
Bees!

616
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:43,430
Bees! Bees! Bees!

617
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:48,194
Stand still!
You're supposed to stand still!

618
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:49,895
Run, run!

619
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:54,136
Bees! Bees! Bees!

620
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,377
My God!

621
00:41:59,983 --> 00:42:01,416
Get the hose!

622
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:05,520
Run, Michael!

623
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:10,851
Put your hands over your eyes.
Don't let them get in your eyes.

624
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,904
He's not allergic to the bees,
so there's no real problem.

625
00:42:24,107 --> 00:42:27,076
He's just gonna be a little
uncomfortable for a while.

626
00:42:27,377 --> 00:42:29,345
I hate the suburbs.

627
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:32,674
I'm surprised your mother-in-law
didn't come along with you today.

628
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,976
She refuses to get in the car with me.

629
00:42:35,185 --> 00:42:38,450
She's never been in a car
when a woman drives.

630
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:43,985
One, two, three.

631
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:45,320
Jump!

632
00:42:45,929 --> 00:42:49,729
The election of a new family-circle
president will take place...

633
00:42:49,933 --> 00:42:51,366
three weeks from Sunday.

634
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:54,059
So we have to make some serious
decision-making.

635
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,001
It's like a furnace in here.
Like a furnace.

636
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:58,697
That concludes old business.

637
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:03,073
I make a proposal that we take
the next meeting at Frock's Farm.

638
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,713
- Very good idea.
- I'm with you.

639
00:43:05,949 --> 00:43:06,949
A very good idea.

640
00:43:06,983 --> 00:43:09,008
It's cooler. We won't
suffocate to death.

641
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:11,881
This is a family-circle meeting,
not an outing.

642
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:14,215
Why not combine the two
when it's this hot?

643
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:16,892
An outing and a family-circle meeting.

644
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:20,358
An outing is an outing, and
a family circle is a family circle.

645
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:21,724
I'm dripping.

646
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,457
Let's finish the meeting
and that'll be it.

647
00:43:24,668 --> 00:43:26,693
And that will be it.
That will be it.

648
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:30,236
When Schulman was alive,
we sat in the meeting.

649
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,237
The meeting finished.
Then we left.

650
00:43:32,442 --> 00:43:35,138
It was hot, it was cold,
it was snow...

651
00:43:35,345 --> 00:43:37,711
it was rain.
We sat and we had a meeting.

652
00:43:37,914 --> 00:43:41,406
If we don't want to meet because
it's hot, let's not meet.

653
00:43:41,618 --> 00:43:43,916
- Do not meet.
- No one said not to meet.

654
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,280
Nobody said not to meet.

655
00:43:45,488 --> 00:43:46,488
It's a furnace.

656
00:43:46,656 --> 00:43:50,422
We need to decide how much money
we'll give to our charity this year.

657
00:43:50,627 --> 00:43:51,855
This is a heat wave.

658
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:53,996
It was hotter at Avalon.

659
00:43:54,197 --> 00:43:57,428
We had a meeting and it was
so hot you couldn't stand up.

660
00:43:57,634 --> 00:43:59,966
What are you talking about?
Aunt Molly fainted.

661
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:01,535
Still, we had the meeting.

662
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:06,072
Last year we gave...
Just let me have a look.

663
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:08,403
We gave to six charities.

664
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:11,342
An elephant just went by the window.

665
00:44:12,015 --> 00:44:13,015
What?

666
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:14,945
It's the heat.
You're hallucinating.

667
00:44:15,518 --> 00:44:20,319
Then the heat made me see another
elephant, because another is going by.

668
00:44:20,657 --> 00:44:23,319
The circus! The circus!

669
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:25,592
The circus!

670
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:32,800
The circus!

671
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,135
Look at this!

672
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,708
They must be going through here
to get to the tent site.

673
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:45,370
- What tent?
- They have a tent at Edmondson Avenue.

674
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,729
Wow, look at the circus, Mom!

675
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,832
The circus is coming.

676
00:45:17,547 --> 00:45:19,037
Yeah! Yeah!

677
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:58,351
Do you got everything?

678
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:02,585
You'll waste the battery.

679
00:46:02,792 --> 00:46:04,953
- And remember, you stay with Sam.
- Okay.

680
00:46:05,161 --> 00:46:08,619
Don't wander off around
the reservoir without him, understand?

681
00:46:08,832 --> 00:46:11,130
We know. We know.

682
00:46:11,334 --> 00:46:13,097
Later, I'll make you breakfast.

683
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:32,380
In the old days, it used to be
hotter in the summertime.

684
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:03,580
Did I tell you my father
never drank water in America?

685
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:07,188
The whole time he was alive,
he never drank water in America.

686
00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:09,255
What did he drink? Coca-Cola?

687
00:47:09,459 --> 00:47:10,517
Whiskey.

688
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,786
If he didn't drink whiskey,
mineral water.

689
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,226
But he never drank...

690
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,931
from the faucet.

691
00:47:17,133 --> 00:47:18,133
Why?

692
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,963
He had the old ways. You see,
we drank from a well.

693
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:24,004
Spring water in the old country.
And he said:

694
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:27,768
"Water that comes through a pipe under
the city can't be good water.

695
00:47:27,977 --> 00:47:29,877
Can't be good for you."

696
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,138
He was a very stubborn man.

697
00:47:32,348 --> 00:47:35,317
And we never could convince him
otherwise.

698
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:37,543
Your grandmother
is a stubborn woman.

699
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,551
We know.

700
00:47:39,789 --> 00:47:41,552
We know.

701
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,833
Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael.

702
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,032
I came to America in 1914.

703
00:48:00,944 --> 00:48:02,571
And when I came to Baltimore...

704
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:06,711
it was the most beautiful place
you ever saw.

705
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,386
We know that story, Sam.
Can you tell us another one?

706
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:14,914
Yeah, wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

707
00:48:15,124 --> 00:48:17,524
Did I tell you I used to
own a nightclub?

708
00:48:17,961 --> 00:48:20,156
You used to own a nightclub?

709
00:48:20,363 --> 00:48:22,490
Yeah, yeah. Not a big nightclub.

710
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,759
A small place
on lower Pennsylvania Avenue.

711
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:29,132
It had a bar and a dance floor.

712
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:15,843
You went off and got married?

713
00:49:16,419 --> 00:49:20,219
You see, we didn't plan
to get married.

714
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:23,859
They decided to get married. We
were taking them to get married.

715
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,427
We were getting married. Jules
has the car, so he gave us a ride.

716
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,825
Because you needed a ride,
my son is married?

717
00:49:30,033 --> 00:49:33,230
No, well, we sort of got
caught up in the moment.

718
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:36,701
Yes, it was very...
Well, you know.

719
00:49:36,906 --> 00:49:38,874
We were gonna marry
sooner or later.

720
00:49:39,075 --> 00:49:40,667
- Sooner or later?
- We got a deal too.

721
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,539
The justice of the peace
charges $10 a couple.

722
00:49:43,746 --> 00:49:45,737
I got him down to $15 for
the whole thing.

723
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:48,349
It's wonderful.
A bargain wedding.

724
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:51,315
You save $5 by getting married.
I am so pleased.

725
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,989
Come on, Dad. Be happy for us.

726
00:49:55,592 --> 00:49:56,854
Do you love my boy?

727
00:49:57,794 --> 00:50:00,661
Yes, I do, very much.

728
00:50:00,863 --> 00:50:04,321
Good. Because that's one
young man that's crazy about you.

729
00:50:05,134 --> 00:50:07,796
Kiss the bride.
Let me see you kiss the bride.

730
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,403
Izzy, kiss your bride.

731
00:50:11,207 --> 00:50:13,767
That's it, that's it, that's it!

732
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:18,408
Dad, if it's all right, she's gonna
sleep at the house tonight.

733
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,953
Where is that marriage certificate?
Let me see it.

734
00:50:27,156 --> 00:50:28,953
- Let me see it.
- Here.

735
00:50:29,158 --> 00:50:32,321
I don't want any hanky-panky
going on in my house.

736
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:38,033
Who's this?
Who's this Jules Kaye here?

737
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,661
That's me, Dad.

738
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,498
I changed my name.

739
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:45,867
Me too. I changed mine to Kirk.

740
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:48,976
It's easier to say than Krichinsky.
Kirk. It's better.

741
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:52,045
Who said names are supposed to
be easy to say?

742
00:50:52,248 --> 00:50:54,113
What are you, a candy bar?

743
00:50:54,317 --> 00:50:58,447
Krichinsky.
It's a name.

744
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,782
Kaye. Kirk.

745
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:02,958
Two cousins, different names.

746
00:51:03,159 --> 00:51:07,789
How can this be a family when the
father is called Sam Krichinsky...

747
00:51:07,997 --> 00:51:12,525
his son is called Jules Kaye
and his first cousin is Izzy Kirk.

748
00:51:13,202 --> 00:51:17,639
This is a family, goddamn it!
Krichinsky is the name of the family!

749
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:22,072
It's not Kaye! It's not Kirk!
It's Krichinsky!

750
00:51:24,781 --> 00:51:26,442
It's Krichinsky.

751
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,311
We argued and argued.

752
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,216
Then the way things are in life,
you stop arguing.

753
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,984
It's your life.
You're gonna have to live it.

754
00:51:38,594 --> 00:51:42,360
What a celebration.
And we celebrated that night.

755
00:52:47,363 --> 00:52:50,423
<i>It wasn't your ordinary
family celebration.</i>

756
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,736
It was the best wedding...

757
00:52:54,937 --> 00:52:56,768
I ever went to.

758
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,014
It's nice.

759
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,880
It's easy to sleep when you have
a breeze. It's easy to sleep.

760
00:53:26,002 --> 00:53:28,095
<i>I'm getting nervous.
Too much expansion.</i>

761
00:53:28,304 --> 00:53:32,206
<i>We bought out that store and that one.
We got all this merchandise.</i>

762
00:53:32,408 --> 00:53:36,310
Nothing's ready, we got no customers.
Money's going out, not coming in.

763
00:53:36,512 --> 00:53:39,845
- I'm getting a little nervous.
- You're not the only one.

764
00:53:41,217 --> 00:53:45,517
I've talked to some of the people
around here in the marketplace...

765
00:53:45,721 --> 00:53:49,680
and I'm not sure anyone knows
what this "discount" is.

766
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,717
I don't know whether it means
anything to anybody.

767
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,863
It's not like we invented the word.

768
00:53:55,064 --> 00:53:57,794
I didn't say that,
but it doesn't mean anything.

769
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,661
What are you saying?

770
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:02,463
I'm saying we need to be more clear.

771
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:06,699
- We need a catchy slogan or something.
- More clear than discount?

772
00:54:06,909 --> 00:54:08,877
More clear than discount.
Something that...

773
00:54:09,078 --> 00:54:11,672
All right. You want a catchy slogan?
How about:

774
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,974
"Guaranteed lowest prices in town."

775
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:16,876
That's good.

776
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,577
A little higher! Higher!

777
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:45,406
Higher! A little higher!

778
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,083
What if someone buys and it's cheaper?

779
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:52,414
Cheaper than they guaranteed is
the lower price. What do you do then?

780
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:57,449
Jules, what happens if somebody buys
cheaper than what you sell?

781
00:54:57,660 --> 00:55:01,118
Good question. What if they get it
cheaper someplace else...

782
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:03,992
since we guarantee
the lowest prices in town?

783
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:08,861
Find somewhere else cheaper,
then we'll match it at that price.

784
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,970
That's good. We'll match it!

785
00:55:11,173 --> 00:55:13,164
They'll match it?
What does that mean?

786
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:17,972
Whatever the guy buys somewhere else
he can get here for the same price.

787
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:20,478
What the hell does he need to
do that for?

788
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:24,517
He bought it, and then they guarantee
they'll give him the same price.

789
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:27,655
That makes no sense. He's gotta
take it back to the shop...

790
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:30,917
and then get it here?
- Why wouldn't that make sense?

791
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,924
- They'd guarantee it?
- Yes.

792
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:35,495
They'd guarantee it.
Maybe make it lower.

793
00:55:35,698 --> 00:55:38,166
How much lower? Because if it's
a nickel lower...

794
00:55:38,367 --> 00:55:41,632
I won't take it all the way back
to get it here for a nickel less.

795
00:55:41,837 --> 00:55:43,361
A little higher!

796
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:45,631
Can we just put up the sign?

797
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,338
Is it me,
or does it look a little low?

798
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:51,410
No, it's still low. It's low.

799
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:55,345
I gotta go to the doctor's, then pick
up the kids from the movie around 4.

800
00:55:55,551 --> 00:55:56,643
- The movies?
- Yeah.

801
00:55:56,852 --> 00:56:01,221
From 10 in the morning to 4?
What do they watch, 9 movies?

802
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:02,789
You're going to the doctor's?

803
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,960
Just a checkup.
What time will you be home?

804
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:06,890
I'll be home probably around 7.

805
00:56:07,096 --> 00:56:10,623
Can you see if my mother wants to go
back with you? Please?

806
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:18,429
What are they doing? They're arguing
again. Arguing again.

807
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:20,966
You want to ride back with me?

808
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,201
With you?

809
00:56:22,678 --> 00:56:23,678
Yeah.

810
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,238
No, I think it's still too soon.

811
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,651
- I've been driving for six months.
- No, still too soon.

812
00:56:29,852 --> 00:56:33,754
You gotta go all the way uptown.
Lot of turns to make. It's too soon.

813
00:56:33,956 --> 00:56:36,925
You'll have to wait till 7:00.
That's when Jules is going home.

814
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:39,356
I'll take a streetcar.
It's on tracks.

815
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,826
You take the 32 and you're there.

816
00:56:42,031 --> 00:56:43,726
All right. Fine.

817
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,360
Higher!

818
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:48,230
- I cannot believe your mother.
- She's not going with you?

819
00:56:48,437 --> 00:56:50,997
No, I haven't been driving
long enough for her.

820
00:56:55,177 --> 00:56:56,667
<i>What's that?</i>

821
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:13,787
I wonder how long it'll be
until we get our own rocket suits.

822
00:57:13,996 --> 00:57:15,054
It'll be great.

823
00:57:15,264 --> 00:57:18,427
We'll be able to rocket to school
and rocket back home.

824
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:19,634
It will be great.

825
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:24,438
I'd love to see my grandmother
rocketing to the store to get bread.

826
00:57:37,186 --> 00:57:39,051
Go, Rocket Man!

827
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,329
Yeah!

828
00:58:08,084 --> 00:58:10,951
Hi, will you fill her up?
I'm going to get my kids.

829
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:13,246
- Sure.
- I'll be right back.

830
00:58:23,265 --> 00:58:24,789
I can't see.

831
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,027
It's because you've been sitting in
a dark movie theater all afternoon.

832
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:51,920
<i>I can't believe this.
Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

833
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:54,824
<i>What are you saying?
That it's my fault?</i>

834
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:56,861
I'm not saying it's your fault.

835
00:58:57,066 --> 00:59:00,968
You say it like it's my fault
that the streetcar smashed my car.

836
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:05,334
I'm not saying it's your fault.
No, you took the car and it got hit.

837
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:08,806
- And I could have been sitting in it.
- You don't understand.

838
00:59:09,011 --> 00:59:12,708
You make it sound as if I'm
responsible, as if it's my fault.

839
00:59:12,915 --> 00:59:14,849
I've been in this country 40 years.

840
00:59:15,050 --> 00:59:18,383
I've never seen a streetcar jump
the track and hit a car.

841
00:59:18,587 --> 00:59:21,112
Am I crazy, or does it sound
like it's my fault?

842
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:24,315
You're being sensitive.
She's not blaming you.

843
00:59:24,527 --> 00:59:28,224
- You're not blaming her, are you?
- No, no, I'm not blaming her.

844
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,524
What I'm saying is, they should
get rid of the streetcars.

845
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,430
They got buses.
Why do they need streetcars?

846
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:36,502
The tracks are too slippery.

847
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,936
I don't even like Sam
to drive in the rain.

848
00:59:40,142 --> 00:59:43,703
The tracks is dangerous. When it
gets wet, it gets too slippery.

849
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,940
Do you know anyone whose car got hit
by a streetcar off its tracks?

850
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:49,208
It's a first.

851
00:59:49,418 --> 00:59:51,886
To think I could've been
sitting in that car.

852
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:54,612
Thank God I didn't get into
that machine.

853
00:59:54,823 --> 00:59:57,018
I cannot believe this conversation.

854
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,353
Can we put the streetcar talk to rest?

855
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:02,622
We're lucky it was nothing serious.
That's the end of it.

856
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:06,232
You should've seen it, Dad.
It was just like the cliffhangers.

857
01:00:06,535 --> 01:00:07,535
Michael!

858
01:00:07,570 --> 01:00:09,663
- Ellen Ferguson.
- What?

859
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:12,841
Ellen Ferguson's car got hit
by a streetcar.

860
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:16,603
It wasn't a streetcar.
It was a train.

861
01:00:16,812 --> 01:00:20,043
Off of Saratoga. Freight train.
It wasn't a streetcar.

862
01:00:20,249 --> 01:00:22,342
- It wasn't a streetcar?
- It was a train.

863
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:23,916
Do you know where my coat is?

864
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,485
In the back closet.
It was too crowded.

865
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,715
Never has there been a streetcar
jumped its tracks.

866
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:33,258
Now, a train has jumped its tracks,
but never a streetcar.

867
01:00:33,462 --> 01:00:37,762
I circulated over 10,000 fliers for
the opening of the new store, Dad.

868
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,366
I never believed in fliers.

869
01:00:39,568 --> 01:00:43,095
If people don't pay for something,
they won't bother reading it.

870
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,967
The newspaper you pay for,
then you read an ad.

871
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,872
Let's hope you're wrong, because we
can't afford newspaper ads.

872
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,880
You can gamble, you're young. You make
mistakes, you can always start again.

873
01:00:55,084 --> 01:00:58,451
See what Solomon did. He could have
stayed in the shoe business...

874
01:00:58,754 --> 01:01:00,654
but he gambled. Today, he's got...

875
01:01:00,856 --> 01:01:03,450
One of Baltimore's
biggest department stores.

876
01:01:03,659 --> 01:01:06,628
- That is true.
- I can't find the coat.

877
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:09,627
God. I sent it to the cleaners.

878
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,959
Dad, where's the keys to your car?

879
01:01:15,137 --> 01:01:16,137
Here.

880
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:18,167
You ready, hon?

881
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:20,308
I'm just putting on my coat.

882
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,572
- Michael, be good.
- I will.

883
01:01:24,446 --> 01:01:26,004
Don't be late.

884
01:01:28,450 --> 01:01:29,883
And it's true with Solomon.

885
01:01:39,695 --> 01:01:42,630
I'm about this far away
from losing my mind.

886
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:50,967
Thank you.

887
01:01:52,107 --> 01:01:54,701
Want pictures here? Pictures?

888
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:59,347
Pictures? Pictures?

889
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:01,307
- Pictures?
- No, thank you.

890
01:02:01,517 --> 01:02:03,451
Pictures here? All right.

891
01:02:03,652 --> 01:02:04,846
Pictures here?

892
01:02:22,538 --> 01:02:23,630
Can I get a picture?

893
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:26,069
All right. Come on.
Everybody smile.

894
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:27,469
Don't laugh.

895
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:29,234
I'm not laughing.

896
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:31,913
Yes, you are. I can see it.

897
01:02:32,681 --> 01:02:34,478
Miss? Miss?
Let's do it again.

898
01:02:34,683 --> 01:02:36,583
- What do you want?
- My eyes weren't open.

899
01:02:36,785 --> 01:02:39,276
They were fine.
What's your problem?

900
01:02:39,488 --> 01:02:40,819
I'm getting nervous.

901
01:02:41,023 --> 01:02:42,615
You? You getting nervous?

902
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:43,825
He makes me nervous.

903
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:45,994
We're back to
the business again.

904
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:47,195
He started it.

905
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:48,396
- What?
- No, no, no.

906
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:50,792
Maybe the customers won't show.

907
01:02:50,999 --> 01:02:53,399
We're expanding. We're getting in
over... You getting this?

908
01:02:53,602 --> 01:02:57,003
It was a genuine concern,
and it remains a genuine concern.

909
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,800
Genuine concern? That I like.

910
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:02,909
Genuine concern. Very nice phrase.

911
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,343
I have to admit, he tends to be
on the conservative side.

912
01:03:06,548 --> 01:03:08,914
If this expansion doesn't go over...

913
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:12,849
we're out of the suburbs
and back into row houses?

914
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,716
That's a genuine concern.

915
01:03:14,923 --> 01:03:18,154
We'll toast to genuine concerns.
It's been acknowledged.

916
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:20,920
No, let's toast to the suburbs,
shall we?

917
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:22,427
Better.

918
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:35,400
Honey, don't count.
Just...

919
01:03:36,578 --> 01:03:37,578
Am I doing good?

920
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,749
- You're doing wonderful.
- Thank you.

921
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:46,183
Who would've thought that this bargain
marriage would have lasted this long?

922
01:03:47,489 --> 01:03:52,426
You know, I didn't get a chance
to tell you before, but...

923
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,629
But what?

924
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,225
- What?
- I'm pregnant.

925
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:02,168
You're what?

926
01:04:03,105 --> 01:04:05,130
I am pregnant. I'm pregnant.

927
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:07,774
- You're kidding?
- No, I am not kidding.

928
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:11,645
You have great news
and you wait until now to tell me?

929
01:04:11,847 --> 01:04:15,715
I would've told you sooner, but the
streetcar discussion got in the way.

930
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,614
It didn't seem like the proper time
to get in the fact...

931
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,789
that I'm pregnant again.

932
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,757
Let's face it, the streetcar
story was all-consuming.

933
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:30,454
Honey, this is great news.

934
01:04:38,740 --> 01:04:40,833
Let's do that promenade thing.

935
01:05:32,060 --> 01:05:34,654
Please. It's bad enough
over there.

936
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:13,231
What is this?

937
01:06:15,604 --> 01:06:17,071
What is this?

938
01:06:17,439 --> 01:06:19,634
There's a lot of people for something.

939
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:22,369
This is us.

940
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:23,943
This is for us!

941
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:29,411
- Discount is here.
- This is good.

942
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,086
- Look at this!
- This is good.

943
01:06:32,287 --> 01:06:35,415
Don't go anywhere,
we're coming right out!

944
01:07:07,322 --> 01:07:10,155
But I don't even know what
he looks like.

945
01:07:13,495 --> 01:07:16,828
Where are the people who
know where the people are?

946
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,808
Simka.

947
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:44,423
Simkala!

948
01:08:02,177 --> 01:08:04,611
Gittle, welcome, welcome.

949
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,311
I don't know exactly what
they were saying.

950
01:09:12,514 --> 01:09:15,415
I couldn't tell if they met
in the concentration camp.

951
01:09:15,617 --> 01:09:19,849
It couldn't be that, right?
Must have been the refugee camp.

952
01:09:21,456 --> 01:09:24,789
I don't think she was
in a concentration camp.

953
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:28,689
What I got was that
her husband died in the war.

954
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:30,461
No, I didn't get that.

955
01:09:30,665 --> 01:09:34,123
She would not have had that child
in a concentration camp.

956
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:36,634
I think he met her
in the refugee camp.

957
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:40,706
To think a woman could survive
a concentration camp with a child.

958
01:09:40,909 --> 01:09:43,400
My God.
It gives me the chills.

959
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,172
I don't think she was
in a concentration camp.

960
01:09:46,381 --> 01:09:50,681
I got that they met in a refugee camp,
that her husband died.

961
01:09:50,886 --> 01:09:55,516
But the refugee camp was recently
and the kid is like six, so...

962
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,620
No.

963
01:09:58,059 --> 01:09:59,754
We'll have to ask later.

964
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:09,569
See, there's nothing else to
do with it. It's done.

965
01:10:09,771 --> 01:10:13,935
That's the problem with model planes.
There's nothing to do but look at them.

966
01:10:14,142 --> 01:10:15,336
It doesn't fly.

967
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,738
It'll never fly.

968
01:10:16,945 --> 01:10:20,346
We could throw it off a building
and watch it crash.

969
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,143
How about a cliffhanger?

970
01:10:23,351 --> 01:10:25,819
Now that's an idea.

971
01:11:14,769 --> 01:11:15,769
Boom!

972
01:11:15,837 --> 01:11:17,702
Another chapter!

973
01:11:19,708 --> 01:11:22,734
My God! My God!
What's happening?

974
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:25,276
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

975
01:11:28,350 --> 01:11:29,647
You'll burn the house!

976
01:11:29,851 --> 01:11:32,046
You've got the wing on your foot!

977
01:11:36,391 --> 01:11:39,986
Fire in the house will burn
the house to the ground.

978
01:11:40,195 --> 01:11:42,595
It was just a cliffhanger.

979
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,965
The pilgrims started it,
whoever they were.

980
01:11:47,168 --> 01:11:51,798
We all have to give thanks. We kill
a turkey and everybody says thank you.

981
01:11:52,007 --> 01:11:53,474
It's a holiday.

982
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:57,202
We never have turkey the rest of the
year, but now we have to eat it.

983
01:11:57,412 --> 01:12:01,610
It's a funny holiday, if you ask me.
It makes no sense.

984
01:12:01,816 --> 01:12:04,979
- Are we going to eat?
- Gabriel should be here any minute.

985
01:12:05,186 --> 01:12:07,780
That man will be late
for his own funeral.

986
01:12:10,258 --> 01:12:13,091
Dad? Dad, why don't we eat?

987
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:14,421
Yeah, we're hungry!

988
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:16,695
- I'm hungry.
- We want to eat.

989
01:12:16,898 --> 01:12:19,594
No, no, no.
We should wait for Gabriel.

990
01:12:19,801 --> 01:12:20,801
Wait for Gabriel.

991
01:12:21,002 --> 01:12:22,936
Every year we go through
the same thing.

992
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:26,073
We can't cut the turkey
because of Gabriel.

993
01:12:26,274 --> 01:12:28,105
Jules...

994
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:30,073
cut the turkey!

995
01:12:31,079 --> 01:12:34,048
- I made the mold this time.
- It's lovely.

996
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:44,989
- I hate when food touches.
- It all ends up in the same place.

997
01:12:45,193 --> 01:12:47,388
I hate that!
I hate when it touches!

998
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:48,960
Michael.

999
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:54,525
Sorry we're late.

1000
01:12:56,905 --> 01:12:57,905
Gabriel.

1001
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,534
You started without me?

1002
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:06,745
You cut the turkey without me?

1003
01:13:10,218 --> 01:13:13,745
Come on, we leave.
They start without us, we go.

1004
01:13:13,955 --> 01:13:17,413
Every year you're late. We were
hungry, the kids wanted to eat.

1005
01:13:17,625 --> 01:13:18,625
We couldn't wait.

1006
01:13:18,793 --> 01:13:21,921
Your own flesh and blood,
and you couldn't wait?

1007
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:23,597
You cut the turkey!

1008
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:28,491
That's it! That's the last time
we come for Thanksgiving!

1009
01:13:28,703 --> 01:13:30,898
Gabriel, come here, for God's sake.

1010
01:13:31,706 --> 01:13:33,469
Gabriel! Gabriel!

1011
01:13:33,675 --> 01:13:35,905
- Come back!
- Such a lunatic.

1012
01:13:36,111 --> 01:13:38,409
It's ridiculous.
The same thing every year.

1013
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:41,844
We wait for him, he shows up late,
then we cut the turkey.

1014
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,211
You cut the turkey!

1015
01:13:45,086 --> 01:13:47,213
It took us hours to get here.

1016
01:13:47,422 --> 01:13:49,652
You live miles from nowhere.

1017
01:13:49,858 --> 01:13:54,192
It's too far, for God's sake.
Too far for relatives.

1018
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,795
Your new relatives.

1019
01:13:55,997 --> 01:13:59,057
You have relatives that live near you
who you'll wait for.

1020
01:13:59,267 --> 01:14:03,465
Gabriel, for God's sake, let's not
make an issue out of the turkey.

1021
01:14:03,671 --> 01:14:06,231
That's what happens
when you get to be wealthy.

1022
01:14:06,441 --> 01:14:10,605
Your son's wealthy so you don't wait
for your brother to cut the turkey.

1023
01:14:10,812 --> 01:14:11,938
To hell with you!

1024
01:14:12,147 --> 01:14:13,147
To hell with me?

1025
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:17,776
Jules making a good living has nothing
to do with the turkey. Nothing!

1026
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:20,247
When we lived in Avalon, nobody ate.

1027
01:14:20,455 --> 01:14:22,548
You wait for everybody
before you eat...

1028
01:14:22,757 --> 01:14:25,123
much less cut the turkey
without a brother.

1029
01:14:25,326 --> 01:14:28,557
You move to the suburbs and you think
it doesn't matter anymore.

1030
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:31,732
The young ones are hungry.
They make a commotion.

1031
01:14:31,933 --> 01:14:34,231
You want to stand on ceremony
with the family?

1032
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:38,964
There's always young ones that are
hungry that carry on and want to eat.

1033
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:43,770
They got to wait till every relative
is there before the turkey's cut.

1034
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:45,969
I've said enough!

1035
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:10,671
What's wrong?

1036
01:15:35,997 --> 01:15:37,931
<i>Put all kitchen appliances here.</i>

1037
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:40,863
<i>Washing machines, refrigerators,
a whole department.</i>

1038
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:45,335
We got one entire floor just for
bedroom sets, sleepers, sofas.

1039
01:15:45,540 --> 01:15:48,475
It's been no time since we
expanded the other place.

1040
01:15:48,676 --> 01:15:51,645
- Where's the money coming from?
- The bank is financing us.

1041
01:15:51,846 --> 01:15:52,846
The bank?

1042
01:15:52,881 --> 01:15:55,145
They're giving us the money.
This is the time.

1043
01:15:55,350 --> 01:15:59,753
You know, you open a place like this,
no one can compete with us.

1044
01:15:59,954 --> 01:16:02,980
We got a chance, we might as well
run with it.

1045
01:16:03,191 --> 01:16:05,421
Discount department store.

1046
01:16:05,627 --> 01:16:07,720
- Right.
- This place is enormous.

1047
01:16:07,929 --> 01:16:10,591
What's the worst that can happen?
It goes under.

1048
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:12,193
It goes under?

1049
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:14,800
Right. How much money
you got right now?

1050
01:16:15,003 --> 01:16:17,096
You got nothing. You got nothing.

1051
01:16:17,305 --> 01:16:22,208
I got nothing because every time
I make a dollar, you want to expand.

1052
01:16:22,677 --> 01:16:27,580
God forbid the place goes under.
You can't have less than nothing.

1053
01:16:27,782 --> 01:16:30,444
It's not a lot. What are we?
We're a discount warehouse.

1054
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:35,248
There's nothing like it. No frills,
no fixtures. No one's ever done this.

1055
01:16:35,456 --> 01:16:37,481
I'll have to invent new ways
to count money.

1056
01:16:37,692 --> 01:16:40,024
We're gonna tear up this town.

1057
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:41,722
Yeah?

1058
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:46,191
- All right. Let's do it.
- Yes!

1059
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:47,766
Let's do it.

1060
01:16:54,709 --> 01:16:59,646
A job at McCormick's spice company.
Good, very good. Good.

1061
01:17:01,249 --> 01:17:03,149
We'll have a family-circle meeting.

1062
01:17:03,351 --> 01:17:05,842
Get everybody to help you
get your own place.

1063
01:17:08,323 --> 01:17:10,086
Own place.

1064
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:15,562
That's a good drink.

1065
01:17:15,763 --> 01:17:18,926
You'll have your own place.
You'll be an American, like us.

1066
01:17:19,667 --> 01:17:20,827
Two...

1067
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:22,798
eleven...

1068
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:25,769
and thirteen.

1069
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,737
That's the only channels we've got.

1070
01:17:27,942 --> 01:17:29,910
<i>Howdy Doody</i> on 11.

1071
01:17:30,111 --> 01:17:33,808
That's the channel you want
in the afternoon. Want to try it?

1072
01:17:34,015 --> 01:17:37,974
Two, 11, 13.

1073
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:40,688
<i>Howdy Doody.</i>

1074
01:17:40,888 --> 01:17:44,619
Monday through Friday, <i>Captain Video.</i>
That one's great.

1075
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,386
Did you ever see <i>Captain Video</i>
where you come from?

1076
01:17:47,595 --> 01:17:49,688
<i>Captain Video?</i>

1077
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:52,456
<i>Captain Video.</i>

1078
01:17:59,340 --> 01:18:00,773
Where is Michael?

1079
01:18:00,975 --> 01:18:02,499
He's in the car.

1080
01:18:03,411 --> 01:18:05,402
When's Jules coming
to the family circle?

1081
01:18:05,613 --> 01:18:09,879
He'll be there. He said he
wanted to take some golf lessons.

1082
01:18:10,084 --> 01:18:12,018
Golf? He's gonna play golf?

1083
01:18:12,220 --> 01:18:15,986
That's what I said when I heard.
A working person doesn't play golf.

1084
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,215
It's for people
with feathers and a cap.

1085
01:18:18,426 --> 01:18:20,587
<i>Where does he get such crazy ideas?</i>

1086
01:18:20,795 --> 01:18:22,126
<i>Why is it so unusual?</i>

1087
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:25,128
<i>It's not unusual.
I just never heard of it.</i>

1088
01:18:25,333 --> 01:18:26,960
<i>Don't run with the machine.</i>

1089
01:18:27,168 --> 01:18:30,399
<i>I'm not running.
I'm going 25 miles an hour.</i>

1090
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:34,735
<i>You're running, you're running!
The trees are going past too quick.</i>

1091
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:37,035
Okay. Goodbye, buddy.

1092
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:39,713
- Touching!
- Touching!

1093
01:18:42,383 --> 01:18:44,817
I'm gonna use my Linky.
Beat that.

1094
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,249
I don't think we have to chip in
for Simka, that's all.

1095
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:53,984
It's part of our tradition.

1096
01:18:54,195 --> 01:18:56,959
One brings another over.
We supported them.

1097
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:59,531
We took care of them.
You brought me.

1098
01:18:59,734 --> 01:19:02,328
When did we last give
percentages of our money?

1099
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,004
How long has it been?

1100
01:19:04,205 --> 01:19:05,832
It's got to have been 25 years.

1101
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,702
Belle came over in the late '20s...

1102
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:11,538
so it wouldn't be 25 years.
Let's see now.

1103
01:19:11,746 --> 01:19:13,373
It couldn't be 25 years.

1104
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:16,015
It's close to 25 years.

1105
01:19:16,317 --> 01:19:20,219
He came in 1930, then it's close
to 25 years and that's it!

1106
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:22,855
You want to support every Tom,
Dick and Harry?

1107
01:19:23,057 --> 01:19:27,494
We're talking about my wife's brother.
Herbie, you talk like an idiot.

1108
01:19:27,695 --> 01:19:29,925
Don't call my son an idiot.
He's not an idiot.

1109
01:19:30,131 --> 01:19:31,393
Tom, Dick and Harry.

1110
01:19:31,599 --> 01:19:34,693
He has never had any sense.
Never had common sense.

1111
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:38,133
Just because Jules has money,
you call my Herbie an idiot?

1112
01:19:38,339 --> 01:19:40,830
Come on! Nobody's calling
anybody an idiot.

1113
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:42,475
He called my son an idiot.

1114
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:47,205
His son makes money, and all of
a sudden they get this attitude.

1115
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:49,815
What attitude?
What are you talking about?

1116
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:54,647
Living out in the sticks, you don't
wait for anybody to cut the turkey.

1117
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,882
This is about
the goddamn turkey again!

1118
01:19:58,092 --> 01:20:00,822
The goddamn turkey again
and again and again.

1119
01:20:01,028 --> 01:20:02,028
Yeah, yeah.

1120
01:20:02,096 --> 01:20:03,893
The man has a mind like an elephant.

1121
01:20:04,098 --> 01:20:05,895
He drove all that time...

1122
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:08,432
and you eat the dinner
before he gets there.

1123
01:20:08,636 --> 01:20:11,434
Who ate? We didn't eat the dinner,
we cut the turkey!

1124
01:20:11,639 --> 01:20:14,199
- You ate.
- It wasn't how much you ate...

1125
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:18,846
or you didn't eat. It was the act.
The disregard for an older brother.

1126
01:20:19,046 --> 01:20:21,606
You might as well have stabbed me
in the heart.

1127
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:24,013
What's this about here?

1128
01:20:24,218 --> 01:20:27,585
This meeting is about cutting
a turkey or is about Simka?

1129
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:31,190
Let's get back to the issue about how
to support Simka and his family.

1130
01:20:31,392 --> 01:20:34,520
Another member of the wealthy
contingent is speaking.

1131
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:38,665
Uncle Gabriel, we're out there busting
our asses to make a living.

1132
01:20:38,866 --> 01:20:41,357
- Why are you so contemptuous?
- The language.

1133
01:20:41,569 --> 01:20:44,094
The language.
The children are outside.

1134
01:20:44,305 --> 01:20:47,001
We're not talking about a lot of money
for Eva's brother.

1135
01:20:47,208 --> 01:20:48,607
Not a lot of money?

1136
01:20:48,810 --> 01:20:52,473
Enough of this. I'll give Simka
the money and put an end to it.

1137
01:20:52,680 --> 01:20:53,772
I'm with you, pal.

1138
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:56,279
Good. Let's move on
to the next business.

1139
01:20:56,484 --> 01:20:57,484
Next business?

1140
01:20:57,518 --> 01:20:59,179
Next business:

1141
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:01,154
I resign.

1142
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:03,681
That's the next business.
I resign.

1143
01:21:03,891 --> 01:21:05,188
He resigns!

1144
01:21:05,393 --> 01:21:06,393
I resign!

1145
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:09,327
I am finished! I am finished.

1146
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:11,324
Let's try to settle this.

1147
01:21:13,868 --> 01:21:17,360
I'm insulted. I am not gonna stay
where I am not wanted.

1148
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:19,970
He was a lousy president anyway.

1149
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:21,300
I'm not wanted.

1150
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,238
Come back, Sam.

1151
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,672
We need you, Sam.

1152
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,609
We're going. Get in the car.

1153
01:21:28,516 --> 01:21:29,744
Teddy, Mindy, come on.

1154
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:33,343
Teddy, Mindy, come on. Come on!

1155
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:37,046
Sam, Sam! Come back, for God's sake!
Let's talk.

1156
01:21:37,258 --> 01:21:40,250
Gabriel, let's talk.
Come out! You're brothers!

1157
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:41,985
- Is it over already?
- Sam!

1158
01:21:42,196 --> 01:21:43,686
We're going to get Chinese?

1159
01:21:43,898 --> 01:21:45,729
- Get in the car.
- Where's your car?

1160
01:21:45,933 --> 01:21:48,060
The golf pro dropped Izzy and me off.

1161
01:21:48,269 --> 01:21:50,066
Never do I come back. Never!

1162
01:21:51,472 --> 01:21:54,066
We brought you to this country.

1163
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:57,237
We put you in
the paper-hanging business.

1164
01:21:57,445 --> 01:22:01,074
And if it wasn't for my say-so,
you'd still be in the old country.

1165
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:05,450
You wanted to quit the paper business.
You wanted to own your own club...

1166
01:22:05,653 --> 01:22:07,746
I said, okay.

1167
01:22:07,955 --> 01:22:09,923
When the nightclub was over...

1168
01:22:10,124 --> 01:22:13,287
and you wanted back in
the business, I said, okay!

1169
01:22:13,494 --> 01:22:17,191
That's got nothing to do with nothing.
Nothing!

1170
01:22:18,432 --> 01:22:23,369
I came to a Thanksgiving dinner
at my brother's house.

1171
01:22:23,971 --> 01:22:26,667
But you have no respect.

1172
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,403
No respect!

1173
01:23:39,313 --> 01:23:42,510
I remember when I brought home
the piano for Jules.

1174
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:47,379
It was a beautiful, sunny day.

1175
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,523
You should learn how to play.

1176
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:54,022
I don't know.

1177
01:23:54,228 --> 01:23:55,354
I don't know?

1178
01:23:55,563 --> 01:23:57,963
I tried to teach your father...

1179
01:23:59,233 --> 01:24:03,294
but he never learned. Never.

1180
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:06,199
That's a shame.

1181
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:38,138
The baby's going in your bedroom.
Where are you going to go?

1182
01:24:38,339 --> 01:24:41,672
Michael, there comes a time
when have to leave your kids.

1183
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:44,106
Your mom and dad
need their own place.

1184
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:46,707
But where are you gonna go?

1185
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,746
We'll get a place with Simka,
Gittle and Elka.

1186
01:24:51,952 --> 01:24:54,182
You mean you won't live here?

1187
01:24:55,022 --> 01:24:57,547
See the seam. You get a bubble in it.

1188
01:24:57,758 --> 01:25:01,250
You use the brush like this
and you smooth it out.

1189
01:25:01,462 --> 01:25:02,462
Can I try it?

1190
01:25:02,663 --> 01:25:03,925
Here.

1191
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:08,764
It's not important for you
to know how to wallpaper...

1192
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:11,233
because you should never do this
in your life.

1193
01:25:16,143 --> 01:25:18,941
I don't want you to ever leave.

1194
01:25:19,714 --> 01:25:23,411
One way or another,
we all have to leave.

1195
01:27:51,398 --> 01:27:55,334
On July 4th, the largest discount
department store warehouse...

1196
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:57,834
in the state of Maryland
opens its doors.

1197
01:27:58,038 --> 01:28:00,700
Hi, I'm Jules Kaye.

1198
01:28:00,908 --> 01:28:04,708
And I'm Izzy Kirk.
That's right, Jules, July 4th...

1199
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:09,611
the day you'll get independence
from higher prices when K&K expands.

1200
01:28:09,817 --> 01:28:12,809
60,000 square feet
of discounted merchandise.

1201
01:28:13,020 --> 01:28:17,684
And with that guaranteed
lowest-price-in-town sticker price...

1202
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:19,158
That's not right.

1203
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,193
Okay. Cut it.

1204
01:28:20,327 --> 01:28:21,327
What? Sounded good to me.

1205
01:28:21,495 --> 01:28:23,588
You said price twice.
That threw you off.

1206
01:28:23,797 --> 01:28:25,697
- Price twice.
- You said it twice.

1207
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,390
Let's reset and do this again.

1208
01:28:27,601 --> 01:28:30,661
Lowest-price-guaranteed sticker.

1209
01:28:30,871 --> 01:28:32,668
Guaranteed-lowest-price sticker.

1210
01:28:32,873 --> 01:28:33,897
This is tough.

1211
01:28:34,108 --> 01:28:37,100
We should've got the announcer.
I'm not good at this.

1212
01:28:37,311 --> 01:28:39,211
- They're too professional.
- I'm not good.

1213
01:28:39,413 --> 01:28:41,108
You're very good. We're salesmen.

1214
01:28:41,315 --> 01:28:43,408
Who better to sell than salesmen?

1215
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:47,109
Besides, we can't even
afford these spots.

1216
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:52,686
You'll kill me with this.

1217
01:28:52,893 --> 01:28:55,726
Every time I turn around,
you remind me how broke we are.

1218
01:28:55,930 --> 01:28:59,957
Seriously, this TV thing is
way beyond the advertising budget.

1219
01:29:00,167 --> 01:29:03,762
I told you, nothing will get
the message across like that.

1220
01:29:03,971 --> 01:29:06,769
You told me, you told me.
You love television.

1221
01:29:07,942 --> 01:29:10,638
If what you're saying is true,
what are we gonna do?

1222
01:29:10,844 --> 01:29:12,368
Don't worry, all right?

1223
01:29:12,579 --> 01:29:14,740
Just shift some money around.

1224
01:29:14,949 --> 01:29:17,144
Take from this area, take it to there.

1225
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:19,046
Creative financing.
Boom-boom-boom.

1226
01:29:19,253 --> 01:29:21,187
Everyone does it all the time.

1227
01:29:21,722 --> 01:29:23,383
Lowest-guaranteed-price sticker?

1228
01:29:23,590 --> 01:29:25,023
Can I see the card again?

1229
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:26,753
Can I see that card again?

1230
01:29:26,961 --> 01:29:29,191
Mr. Kaye, you mother's on the phone.

1231
01:29:29,430 --> 01:29:30,430
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1232
01:29:30,464 --> 01:29:33,126
My mother's on the phone?
My mother's on the phone.

1233
01:29:33,334 --> 01:29:35,928
Excuse me.
My mother's on the phone.

1234
01:29:36,136 --> 01:29:37,797
His mother's on the phone.

1235
01:29:38,806 --> 01:29:40,831
Come on, Jules.
Time's money?

1236
01:29:41,041 --> 01:29:42,235
Hold on a second, Mom.

1237
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:46,504
You won't believe this. Simka's moving
to New Jersey to work on a farm.

1238
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:47,981
A farm?

1239
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,074
How did this happen?
I don't understand.

1240
01:29:50,451 --> 01:29:51,451
With cows?

1241
01:29:51,585 --> 01:29:54,349
One of the people he works with
at the spices?

1242
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:56,455
All right. All right, Mom.

1243
01:29:56,657 --> 01:29:59,592
We're gonna have to talk later,
all right? Bye.

1244
01:30:00,194 --> 01:30:01,218
What was that about?

1245
01:30:01,428 --> 01:30:05,262
A worker at McCormick's has a brother.
He's got a farm in New Jersey.

1246
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:08,162
He made Simka a deal.
He'll be the farm manager.

1247
01:30:08,369 --> 01:30:10,360
Or whatever the hell they call it.

1248
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:13,540
It turns out he thinks it's too busy
in a big city.

1249
01:30:13,741 --> 01:30:15,072
That's something.

1250
01:30:15,275 --> 01:30:18,403
- She comes to America in 1918.
- 1916.

1251
01:30:18,612 --> 01:30:21,274
She's got a brother
who was born after she left.

1252
01:30:21,482 --> 01:30:24,212
He gets caught up in the war,
concentration camp.

1253
01:30:24,418 --> 01:30:28,149
They finally meet for the first time
in 30 years...

1254
01:30:28,355 --> 01:30:31,586
and in less than one year,
he decides to move on.

1255
01:30:31,792 --> 01:30:34,124
So much for family reunions.

1256
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:40,399
Everybody out.

1257
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:43,400
- You got your jacket, Jules?
- Wait up, Teddy.

1258
01:30:45,472 --> 01:30:47,099
I hope they show up. Good luck.

1259
01:30:47,307 --> 01:30:50,003
They showed up for the
George Washington sale.

1260
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:52,075
It's one thing they show for that...

1261
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:56,079
it's another on 4th of July
with 60,000 feet of merchandise.

1262
01:30:56,283 --> 01:30:58,547
All right, boys. Time to go to work.

1263
01:30:59,053 --> 01:31:00,987
I forgot something.

1264
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:02,883
I forgot my model-plane kit.

1265
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:05,650
You think he'll be all right
down there all day?

1266
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:08,157
He's got Teddy to play with.

1267
01:31:08,362 --> 01:31:10,762
- Don't kick the seat.
- I'll see you later.

1268
01:31:11,331 --> 01:31:14,323
Come on, Michael. Hurry.
Big day. Don't hold them up.

1269
01:31:16,236 --> 01:31:17,965
- Bye.
- Come on, come on.

1270
01:31:23,577 --> 01:31:25,044
Take a look at that.

1271
01:31:25,245 --> 01:31:26,303
An SE5a.

1272
01:31:26,513 --> 01:31:29,243
This will be good to build and burn.

1273
01:31:29,950 --> 01:31:30,950
You nervous?

1274
01:31:31,718 --> 01:31:33,117
- I'm not.
- You're nervous.

1275
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:35,254
All right, I'm nervous.

1276
01:31:36,156 --> 01:31:40,092
What happens if we get there
and only eight or nine people show?

1277
01:31:41,161 --> 01:31:42,719
You see all this?

1278
01:31:42,996 --> 01:31:44,395
Take a good look.

1279
01:31:44,698 --> 01:31:46,131
You won't see it again.

1280
01:31:46,500 --> 01:31:48,798
- Back to the row houses?
- That's right.

1281
01:32:46,493 --> 01:32:49,621
Finally got through to the store.
They say it's a madhouse.

1282
01:32:49,830 --> 01:32:51,058
What a relief.

1283
01:32:51,265 --> 01:32:55,463
Joe says the fire marshal's there
to keep some of the crowd out.

1284
01:32:55,669 --> 01:32:58,194
There's more people than they
know what to do with.

1285
01:32:58,405 --> 01:33:00,202
- That's amazing.
- They did it!

1286
01:33:00,407 --> 01:33:01,567
- Mom...
- Just a second.

1287
01:33:01,775 --> 01:33:03,675
- How are the kids?
- They're fine.

1288
01:33:03,877 --> 01:33:07,745
They're playing in the basement,
building a model airplane.

1289
01:33:07,948 --> 01:33:09,415
- Mom, can l...
- Just a second.

1290
01:33:09,616 --> 01:33:12,642
They could be out here in the sun
with the other kids.

1291
01:33:12,853 --> 01:33:15,720
Instead they're in a hot basement.
Beats me.

1292
01:33:16,023 --> 01:33:18,389
I blame Teddy.
What do you want, sweetie?

1293
01:33:18,592 --> 01:33:20,719
Is it time to go back in the water?

1294
01:33:20,928 --> 01:33:23,089
Ten minutes until you digest.

1295
01:33:45,352 --> 01:33:47,547
I think you put too many in there!

1296
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:06,800
My God!

1297
01:34:07,007 --> 01:34:08,440
A fire is starting!

1298
01:34:11,578 --> 01:34:13,739
Everything's catching fire!

1299
01:34:50,517 --> 01:34:51,517
Nothing.

1300
01:34:51,618 --> 01:34:53,085
I think that's it.

1301
01:34:59,626 --> 01:35:00,923
That was close.

1302
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:04,757
Just what we need. We burn the store
down the first day it opens.

1303
01:35:04,965 --> 01:35:06,899
That's just what we need.

1304
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:09,899
It don't get much better than this!

1305
01:35:10,103 --> 01:35:13,971
$19,628!

1306
01:35:14,174 --> 01:35:16,267
How do you like that?

1307
01:35:16,877 --> 01:35:18,242
Way to go, brothers!

1308
01:35:18,445 --> 01:35:21,573
You were right. You were right.
We're rich.

1309
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,382
Dad, that sounds horrible.

1310
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:06,852
Mr. Kirk.

1311
01:36:07,060 --> 01:36:08,687
You have a telephone call.

1312
01:36:08,895 --> 01:36:10,886
- What is it?
- I haven't got the call yet.

1313
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:14,898
- Where is it?
- You can get it over at the snack bar.

1314
01:36:15,102 --> 01:36:16,967
- Thank you, sir.
- Be right back.

1315
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:26,212
Hello?

1316
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:27,580
Yeah.

1317
01:36:27,781 --> 01:36:28,781
What?

1318
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,757
Jules. Jules!

1319
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:47,525
- What?
- The new store's on fire.

1320
01:36:47,734 --> 01:36:49,201
- What?
- It's on fire!

1321
01:36:49,403 --> 01:36:50,392
- What happened?
- I don't know.

1322
01:36:50,604 --> 01:36:52,765
It's a four-alarm. Come on!

1323
01:36:54,241 --> 01:36:57,233
Dottie, the store's on fire.
We got to go.

1324
01:36:57,444 --> 01:36:58,741
No.

1325
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:18,223
Don't say anything to anybody. Ever.

1326
01:37:18,432 --> 01:37:21,128
We did it. We burned
the whole store down.

1327
01:37:21,334 --> 01:37:23,268
Hey, Michael! Come on! We're going!

1328
01:37:23,470 --> 01:37:26,371
Remember. Nothing to nobody.

1329
01:38:06,179 --> 01:38:07,179
We're the owners.

1330
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:08,506
It doesn't look good.

1331
01:38:08,715 --> 01:38:09,875
What do you mean?

1332
01:38:10,083 --> 01:38:11,083
Can you save it?

1333
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:12,776
We're trying to contain it.

1334
01:38:12,986 --> 01:38:14,920
There's nothing you can do?

1335
01:38:15,121 --> 01:38:16,918
We're doing all we can.

1336
01:38:25,532 --> 01:38:26,794
Michael!

1337
01:38:34,007 --> 01:38:35,565
Michael!

1338
01:38:36,643 --> 01:38:39,407
I don't know if he'll go to the store.
I'll go after him.

1339
01:38:39,613 --> 01:38:41,205
- Will you stay?
- Of course.

1340
01:38:41,414 --> 01:38:44,110
Are you sure you two
didn't have a fight?

1341
01:40:27,053 --> 01:40:29,112
I hate this thing.

1342
01:40:29,322 --> 01:40:32,450
The radio, you put it on the station,
it's there.

1343
01:40:32,692 --> 01:40:35,718
Here the picture goes this way
and that way.

1344
01:40:39,199 --> 01:40:41,793
That's it. You got radio.

1345
01:40:46,172 --> 01:40:48,834
- Sam!
- Michael is here?

1346
01:40:49,042 --> 01:40:50,475
Michael, what's wrong?

1347
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:52,542
- I did a terrible thing.
- Calm down.

1348
01:40:52,746 --> 01:40:54,111
No.

1349
01:40:58,218 --> 01:40:59,583
I did a terrible thing.

1350
01:40:59,786 --> 01:41:01,879
- Terrible. Terrible.
- What happened?

1351
01:41:02,088 --> 01:41:06,525
Me and Teddy played with the model
airplane and something happened.

1352
01:41:06,726 --> 01:41:09,490
- I told you not to play with that.
- I didn't know.

1353
01:41:09,696 --> 01:41:12,859
- I knew it. Now it's happened.
- We put it out.

1354
01:41:13,066 --> 01:41:15,091
- Eva, please.
- It was just a little fire.

1355
01:41:15,301 --> 01:41:17,599
What are you talking about?

1356
01:41:17,804 --> 01:41:21,035
- I burned the store down.
- My God!

1357
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:27,744
I don't know where he is.

1358
01:41:27,947 --> 01:41:31,314
He ran out of the house.
I thought maybe he came down here.

1359
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,349
I don't know where he is.

1360
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:37,284
- What are you yelling at me for?
- I'm not! I'm worried about him!

1361
01:41:37,490 --> 01:41:39,185
- What?
- Come on.

1362
01:41:39,392 --> 01:41:40,484
I'll be right there.

1363
01:41:40,694 --> 01:41:42,559
Call my parents. Maybe he's there.

1364
01:41:42,762 --> 01:41:45,230
- I'll go look for him.
- Call my parents.

1365
01:41:45,432 --> 01:41:47,263
And let me know. All right?

1366
01:41:56,676 --> 01:41:58,337
I told your mother...

1367
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:02,003
to have your father
come and get you...

1368
01:42:02,215 --> 01:42:06,151
because you had something
very important to say.

1369
01:42:08,488 --> 01:42:10,615
You'll have to tell him.

1370
01:42:14,494 --> 01:42:16,485
How am I going to do that?

1371
01:42:26,406 --> 01:42:27,406
Michael.

1372
01:42:29,442 --> 01:42:30,875
Michael.

1373
01:42:51,231 --> 01:42:53,096
So, what's all the mystery?

1374
01:42:55,101 --> 01:42:57,695
Michael has something
he has to tell you.

1375
01:42:58,505 --> 01:42:59,767
Go, Michael.

1376
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:06,945
Daddy...

1377
01:43:07,413 --> 01:43:09,108
it's my fault.

1378
01:43:09,349 --> 01:43:10,509
What?

1379
01:43:10,817 --> 01:43:12,284
I burned the store down.

1380
01:43:13,353 --> 01:43:14,718
You what?

1381
01:43:15,555 --> 01:43:20,219
Me and Teddy were playing
with the model airplane...

1382
01:43:20,426 --> 01:43:24,192
and we finished it and put glue
all around the basement...

1383
01:43:24,397 --> 01:43:28,060
and Teddy had some firecrackers...

1384
01:43:28,268 --> 01:43:29,565
and we added those.

1385
01:43:29,769 --> 01:43:31,930
We lit it and it caught fire...

1386
01:43:32,138 --> 01:43:36,006
and we thought we put it out,
but we didn't, I guess.

1387
01:43:40,380 --> 01:43:42,746
Sit down.

1388
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:47,047
How many times have you been told
not to play with fire?

1389
01:43:47,253 --> 01:43:48,618
- Lots.
- A lot.

1390
01:43:48,822 --> 01:43:51,552
You think maybe it's time
you start to listen?

1391
01:43:51,758 --> 01:43:53,055
Yeah.

1392
01:44:12,212 --> 01:44:14,407
Well, I'm glad that you told me.

1393
01:44:16,249 --> 01:44:18,342
It's a very brave thing to do.

1394
01:44:20,253 --> 01:44:22,744
It's not your fault.
I talked to the fire marshal...

1395
01:44:22,956 --> 01:44:25,390
and the fire started
on the fourth floor.

1396
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:28,293
It started on the fourth floor?

1397
01:44:28,828 --> 01:44:30,591
They're not 100 percent sure.

1398
01:44:30,797 --> 01:44:33,994
It seems there was some kind
of an electrical fire.

1399
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:36,760
It started on the fourth floor?

1400
01:44:37,003 --> 01:44:38,868
Not in the basement?

1401
01:44:43,476 --> 01:44:45,569
You didn't do it, Michael.

1402
01:44:48,715 --> 01:44:50,410
Come on, let's go home.

1403
01:44:53,219 --> 01:44:54,948
- Jules.
- Yeah?

1404
01:44:55,154 --> 01:44:57,952
Jules, what about the store?

1405
01:44:58,591 --> 01:45:00,149
It's gone, Dad.

1406
01:45:01,661 --> 01:45:03,151
It's all gone.

1407
01:45:36,329 --> 01:45:38,354
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

1408
01:45:39,399 --> 01:45:42,095
It means we don't have any insurance
to cover this.

1409
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:50,534
What are you talking about?
You took care of that stuff.

1410
01:45:51,844 --> 01:45:56,008
What are you talking about? You're
telling me we don't have any insurance?

1411
01:45:56,215 --> 01:45:58,376
We had it. I canceled it.

1412
01:45:58,685 --> 01:46:00,482
You canceled it?!

1413
01:46:00,887 --> 01:46:04,516
There's no insurance for this whole
thing? How's that possible?

1414
01:46:04,724 --> 01:46:06,214
What the hell did you do?

1415
01:46:06,693 --> 01:46:11,096
I told you when we did the commercials
that we didn't have enough money.

1416
01:46:11,297 --> 01:46:14,289
You didn't care when I said
we had to shift the money around.

1417
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:16,730
Take a little from here,
borrow from there.

1418
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:19,966
It's always been borrowing from Peter
to pay Paul.

1419
01:46:20,173 --> 01:46:21,902
It's like a gamble.

1420
01:46:22,108 --> 01:46:25,874
I took from the insurance, figured we'd
save while we set up advertising...

1421
01:46:26,079 --> 01:46:28,274
and get this place on its feet.

1422
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,581
This is like...

1423
01:46:32,785 --> 01:46:34,082
a fluke.

1424
01:46:34,554 --> 01:46:35,714
You know?

1425
01:46:38,157 --> 01:46:39,419
Yeah.

1426
01:46:40,927 --> 01:46:42,724
It's a fluke all right.

1427
01:46:43,396 --> 01:46:45,091
Things like this don't happen.

1428
01:46:46,099 --> 01:46:49,000
What are the odds on this?
What's it gotta be?

1429
01:46:49,869 --> 01:46:51,996
- Something like this?
- Yeah.

1430
01:46:53,339 --> 01:46:56,001
- It's gotta be a million to one.
- Exactly.

1431
01:47:00,279 --> 01:47:02,042
So, what will we do?

1432
01:47:03,616 --> 01:47:06,551
Well, file bankruptcy, regroup...

1433
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:07,981
start over.

1434
01:47:08,621 --> 01:47:10,452
We'll lose some distributors.

1435
01:47:10,656 --> 01:47:13,216
They won't want to do business
with us anymore.

1436
01:47:13,426 --> 01:47:15,291
But we'll pick up some new lines.

1437
01:47:15,561 --> 01:47:17,552
With a little luck, we'll be back.

1438
01:47:21,267 --> 01:47:23,360
No, I think that's it for me.

1439
01:47:26,906 --> 01:47:29,841
It's too much of a roller coaster ride
for me.

1440
01:47:34,147 --> 01:47:36,615
Krichinsky cousins, Kirk and Kaye.

1441
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:39,477
This is the end of the road for me.

1442
01:47:41,421 --> 01:47:42,581
What will you do?

1443
01:47:45,224 --> 01:47:47,749
A salesman can always sell.

1444
01:47:47,960 --> 01:47:50,758
It's not the product.
It's the salesman.

1445
01:47:53,066 --> 01:47:55,261
That's what my father always said.

1446
01:48:10,917 --> 01:48:13,681
<i>Sam, don't run with the machine.</i>

1447
01:48:13,886 --> 01:48:15,251
<i>I'm not running.</i>

1448
01:48:15,455 --> 01:48:18,015
<i>Sam, why don't you speak to Gabriel?</i>

1449
01:48:18,224 --> 01:48:20,215
<i>I never speak to him.</i>

1450
01:48:20,693 --> 01:48:23,821
<i>You don't speak to Gabriel,
then Nathan won't speak to you...</i>

1451
01:48:24,030 --> 01:48:26,931
<i>because he doesn't like that you
don't speak to Gabriel.</i>

1452
01:48:27,133 --> 01:48:29,431
We got four brothers
and two don't speak.

1453
01:48:29,635 --> 01:48:32,069
But Nathan speaks to you
when you speak to me.

1454
01:48:32,271 --> 01:48:34,432
I can talk to you.
This he can tolerate.

1455
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:38,838
But he won't talk to you unless you
speak personally to Gabriel.

1456
01:48:39,745 --> 01:48:40,939
Got an indigestion.

1457
01:48:41,147 --> 01:48:42,944
You've been having it a lot.

1458
01:48:43,149 --> 01:48:46,175
Yeah. Whatever I eat, it lays on me.

1459
01:48:46,385 --> 01:48:48,410
Bombs away!

1460
01:48:50,356 --> 01:48:53,348
- Why aren't they at the country club?
- I don't know.

1461
01:48:53,693 --> 01:48:57,220
They don't like it there.
They like it better here with us.

1462
01:48:57,930 --> 01:49:01,388
They better like the club,
because they're getting rid of this.

1463
01:49:01,601 --> 01:49:04,627
- What are you talking about?
- I was talking to the old man.

1464
01:49:04,837 --> 01:49:07,965
He's selling the place.
They want to build homes here.

1465
01:49:08,341 --> 01:49:09,672
Homes?

1466
01:49:09,876 --> 01:49:11,935
It's too far for homes.

1467
01:49:12,145 --> 01:49:15,945
You got to be a pioneer.
You can't get here with a streetcar.

1468
01:49:16,149 --> 01:49:19,380
They can build homes, they can
put more streetcar tracks.

1469
01:49:29,629 --> 01:49:30,755
Again?

1470
01:49:30,963 --> 01:49:32,590
Indigestion?

1471
01:49:33,032 --> 01:49:35,091
I think I'll take a little walk.

1472
01:49:35,301 --> 01:49:36,632
Might help.

1473
01:49:36,836 --> 01:49:39,771
- Do you boys want to go for a walk?
- Yeah.

1474
01:49:40,406 --> 01:49:43,000
Fix me another sandwich, will you?

1475
01:49:43,209 --> 01:49:44,972
You already had two.

1476
01:49:45,178 --> 01:49:46,873
This will make three.

1477
01:49:47,380 --> 01:49:51,908
- You want something, Sam?
- No, no, nothing for me, thanks.

1478
01:50:58,417 --> 01:51:01,011
- How's she doing today?
- The same.

1479
01:51:01,220 --> 01:51:05,589
Every day's the same. She gets better,
she comes out, gets worse, comes back.

1480
01:51:05,791 --> 01:51:08,760
In and out.
In and out of the hospital.

1481
01:51:08,995 --> 01:51:11,725
Dad, Ann's going to make
a Thanksgiving dinner.

1482
01:51:11,931 --> 01:51:14,559
I know, I know.
She's been here all day.

1483
01:51:14,767 --> 01:51:17,429
- You going to come over?
- No, I better stay here.

1484
01:51:17,637 --> 01:51:20,367
I already had a bite in the room
with your mother.

1485
01:51:20,840 --> 01:51:24,037
All right.
If you change your mind.

1486
01:51:34,420 --> 01:51:35,614
Hi, Ma.

1487
01:51:38,057 --> 01:51:39,490
How you doing?

1488
01:51:39,859 --> 01:51:41,724
I'm tired.

1489
01:51:43,095 --> 01:51:45,928
- How's the new job?
- It's good.

1490
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:47,798
I like it.

1491
01:51:49,402 --> 01:51:51,666
It's interesting...

1492
01:51:51,871 --> 01:51:53,566
and it's challenging.

1493
01:51:53,973 --> 01:51:55,065
I like it.

1494
01:51:56,976 --> 01:51:58,910
Selling time.

1495
01:51:59,345 --> 01:52:01,142
I never heard of such a thing.

1496
01:52:01,347 --> 01:52:04,908
It's not just time.
It's time for television commercials.

1497
01:52:05,117 --> 01:52:09,144
Companies buy the time for commercials
to sell their products.

1498
01:52:09,622 --> 01:52:11,317
I hate commercials.

1499
01:52:13,893 --> 01:52:18,489
But I like the one where the cigarette
packs dance. I like that one.

1500
01:52:19,832 --> 01:52:21,493
Did you sell them time?

1501
01:52:22,768 --> 01:52:23,768
No, Ma.

1502
01:52:24,370 --> 01:52:27,362
That's a shame,
because I like that one.

1503
01:52:49,895 --> 01:52:53,058
<i>Henry! Henry Aldrich!</i>

1504
01:52:53,265 --> 01:52:55,062
<i>Coming, Mother.</i>

1505
01:53:51,791 --> 01:53:54,589
We have come here
to pay our final respects...

1506
01:53:55,461 --> 01:53:57,486
to the late Eva Krichinsky...

1507
01:53:57,696 --> 01:53:59,391
a woman of valor.

1508
01:54:00,032 --> 01:54:01,499
She came to America...

1509
01:54:01,700 --> 01:54:03,759
in 1916.

1510
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:06,097
She married...

1511
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:08,304
and raised a beautiful family.

1512
01:54:08,574 --> 01:54:12,476
Was a devoted wife
and a caring mother.

1513
01:54:13,546 --> 01:54:16,481
One who was loved and respected
by her family...

1514
01:54:16,682 --> 01:54:18,377
and many friends.

1515
01:54:18,584 --> 01:54:21,815
She lived a full and happy life.

1516
01:54:47,913 --> 01:54:49,881
Gabriel didn't come.

1517
01:54:50,449 --> 01:54:52,280
Nathan didn't come.

1518
01:54:52,852 --> 01:54:54,717
What happened to Simka?

1519
01:54:55,688 --> 01:54:58,122
He called. He couldn't get away.

1520
01:54:58,724 --> 01:55:01,158
Couldn't get anyone
to take care of the farm.

1521
01:55:02,127 --> 01:55:04,118
This is not a family.

1522
01:55:05,030 --> 01:55:06,657
Not a family.

1523
01:56:07,893 --> 01:56:10,293
Dad, come on for some dinner.

1524
01:57:03,182 --> 01:57:05,912
- What's the matter with your corn?
- I don't like it.

1525
01:57:07,653 --> 01:57:09,518
Since when you don't like it?

1526
01:57:09,822 --> 01:57:12,052
I've been making you corn since...

1527
01:57:12,591 --> 01:57:14,786
How was school today, Michael?

1528
01:57:17,529 --> 01:57:18,996
Dad, that's David.

1529
01:57:19,198 --> 01:57:21,166
Michael is in college.

1530
01:57:25,004 --> 01:57:27,063
It was yesterday...

1531
01:57:27,272 --> 01:57:30,935
I had to go up to the school.
He was in trouble.

1532
01:57:31,143 --> 01:57:33,043
Something with...

1533
01:57:33,612 --> 01:57:35,773
"may" and "can."

1534
01:57:36,248 --> 01:57:38,808
With "may" and "can."

1535
01:57:42,354 --> 01:57:45,482
<i>Scientists prove there is no life
on Mars as we know it.</i>

1536
01:58:09,181 --> 01:58:10,910
He wets the bed.

1537
01:58:15,721 --> 01:58:17,746
My dad wets the bed.

1538
01:58:51,056 --> 01:58:55,015
- You'd like to see Sam Krichinsky?
- Yes, I'm his grandson. Michael Kaye.

1539
01:58:55,227 --> 01:58:57,752
- Do you know the way?
- Yeah.

1540
01:58:57,963 --> 01:59:00,090
- Does my son need one?
- No, he's fine.

1541
01:59:39,104 --> 01:59:42,301
In the end, you spend everything
you ever saved...

1542
01:59:42,508 --> 01:59:45,500
sell everything
you've ever owned...

1543
01:59:45,778 --> 01:59:49,475
just to exist in a place like this.

1544
01:59:50,849 --> 01:59:53,317
So are you dating?

1545
01:59:54,520 --> 01:59:56,579
I told you, Sam. I'm married.

1546
01:59:57,489 --> 01:59:59,980
- You are married?
- Yes.

1547
02:00:00,492 --> 02:00:02,255
And this is my son.

1548
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,454
I named him Sam.

1549
02:00:05,097 --> 02:00:08,624
You're not supposed to name him
after the living.

1550
02:00:09,601 --> 02:00:10,898
I know.

1551
02:00:11,937 --> 02:00:13,268
You know?

1552
02:00:15,674 --> 02:00:18,507
Carry on the family name. Carry on.

1553
02:00:22,514 --> 02:00:26,951
Couple of years ago,
I went to see the house on Avalon.

1554
02:00:27,452 --> 02:00:28,942
It was gone.

1555
02:00:29,154 --> 02:00:31,850
Not just the house,
but the whole neighborhood.

1556
02:00:34,226 --> 02:00:36,057
I went to see the ballroom...

1557
02:00:36,261 --> 02:00:39,856
where me and my brother
used to play.

1558
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:42,724
The whole place, gone.

1559
02:00:43,702 --> 02:00:45,169
Not just that.

1560
02:00:45,370 --> 02:00:49,466
But the grocery store
where we used to shop, gone.

1561
02:00:49,675 --> 02:00:51,267
All gone.

1562
02:00:55,881 --> 02:00:58,850
I went to see where Eva lived...

1563
02:00:59,051 --> 02:01:01,417
off Poplar Street.

1564
02:01:02,087 --> 02:01:03,782
It isn't there.

1565
02:01:04,356 --> 02:01:08,952
Not even the street. It isn't there.
Not even the street.

1566
02:01:11,163 --> 02:01:12,960
And then I went to see...

1567
02:01:13,165 --> 02:01:16,328
the nightclub I used to have.

1568
02:01:16,535 --> 02:01:19,299
Thank God it was there...

1569
02:01:19,504 --> 02:01:23,406
because for a minute,
I thought I never was.

1570
02:01:32,284 --> 02:01:36,380
If I knew things would no longer
be here, I would have tried...

1571
02:01:36,755 --> 02:01:39,053
to have remembered better.

1572
02:01:42,794 --> 02:01:44,557
I miss you, Sam.

1573
02:01:48,901 --> 02:01:52,496
I came to America in 1914.

1574
02:01:56,775 --> 02:01:59,300
I came to America...

1575
02:02:00,012 --> 02:02:02,003
in 1914.

1576
02:02:09,521 --> 02:02:12,046
Daddy, that man talks funny.

1577
02:02:12,958 --> 02:02:14,721
He wasn't born here, Sam.

1578
02:02:14,927 --> 02:02:17,794
You mean, he wasn't born in Baltimore?

1579
02:02:17,996 --> 02:02:19,054
No.

1580
02:02:20,232 --> 02:02:22,996
<i>He came to America in 1914.</i>

1581
02:02:23,702 --> 02:02:27,103
<i>He said it was the most beautiful
place he'd ever seen.</i>
