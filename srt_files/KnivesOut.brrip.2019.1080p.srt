1
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morning, Mr. Thrombey.</font>

2
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Thrombey? You up there?</font>

3
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Thrombey, I'm coming in.</font>

4
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit!</font>

5
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You killed him, you bastard!</i></font>

6
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You murdered him!</i></font>

7
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I didn't murder nobody!</i></font>

8
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You slashed his face open.</i></font>

9
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You left him bleeding in the street
like a stuck pig,</i></font>

10
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>then you crushed his skull with a forklift</i></font>

11
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and burned his hands off
to erase the fingerprints!</i></font>

12
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You'll never prove it.</i></font>

13
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We have the nanny-cam footage!</i></font>

14
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, turn that off now, please?</font>

15
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why? It's almost over.
- Now. Please, just turn it off.</font>

16
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,216
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're finding out who did it
and the Wi-Fi sucks in my room...</font>

17
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,336
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Turn it off, now. Alice!
- There's 2 minutes left.</font>

18
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? There isn't even anything bad on.
- Off!</font>

19
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,936
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just normal TV,
and they're just talking!</font>

20
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're talking murder on it!</font>

21
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're just talking.
- Your sister just had a friend she loved</font>

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">slit his throat open and she doesn't need
to be hearing that right now!</font>

23
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's be sensitive!</font>

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alice, you can keep watching your show.
It's fine.</font>

25
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I guessed who did it anyway.
- It's okay.</font>

26
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Marta.</font>

27
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

28
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Harlan's son.</font>

29
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi, Walt.</font>

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Hi, Marta, it's Walt.</i></font>

31
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Would you mind coming to the house early?</i></font>

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The police have
a few more questions for everybody.</i></font>

33
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

34
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Excuse me, ma'am.</font>

35
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You with the help?</font>

36
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Her name's Marta.
She was Granddad's nurse.</font>

37
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's with us. "The help"?</font>

38
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. I'm sorry.</font>

39
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's not okay. What the hell?</font>

40
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you doing?</font>

41
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not very good.</font>

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alone.</font>

43
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lots of this
and not knowing what to do next.</font>

44
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, anything you need...</font>

45
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're part of this family.</font>

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How you doing, kiddo?
- Linda.</font>

48
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you?</font>

49
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the funeral helped, I guess.
Just seeing him.</font>

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you should have been there.</font>

51
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I was outvoted.
- Get arrested!</font>

52
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Die up your own ass for all I care!
- Richard.</font>

53
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not coming.</font>

54
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom. Little shit.</font>

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Missed the funeral.</font>

56
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

57
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're ready for you now.
We'd like to see you one at a time.</font>

58
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. I'll go first.</font>

59
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm assuming this will all be wrapped up
before the memorial tonight.</font>

60
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll do our best, ma'am.</font>

61
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

62
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how you doing, kiddo?</font>

63
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're just gonna reintroduce ourselves
as a formality.</font>

64
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am Detective Lieutenant Elliott,</font>

65
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and this is Trooper Wagner.</font>

66
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I'm going to record this,
just to make things easier.</font>

67
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, we're with
Linda Drysdale nee Thrombey,</font>

68
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan Thrombey's eldest daughter,</font>

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and discussing the events that took place
the night of his demise 1 week ago.</font>

70
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">November 8th.</font>

71
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're very sorry for your loss.</font>

72
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. That means a lot.</font>

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we understand on that night
the family had gathered</font>

74
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- to celebrate your father's 85th birthday?
- Yes.</font>

75
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How was it?
- The party?</font>

76
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pre-my-dad's-death?</font>

77
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, it was great.</font>

78
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did anyone besides the family show face?</font>

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Fran, the housekeeper.</i></font>

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He was a nice guy, but he was so hairy.</font>

81
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jacob?
- And I've dated Italian guys.</font>

82
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I mean? It was like...</font>

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Marta, Harlan's caregiver.</i></font>

84
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Good girl. Hard worker.</i></font>

85
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Her family's from Ecuador.</font>

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Wanetta.</font>

87
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Greatnana. Harlan's mom.</i></font>

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, Nana.
<i>- His mom?</i></font>

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nana?
<i>- Wow. How old is she?</i></font>

90
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We have no idea.</i></font>

91
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay... and your son, Ransom,</font>

92
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>did he attend as well?</i></font>

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yes, but he left early.</i></font>

94
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom, are you leaving?</font>

95
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

96
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you say that all 3 of you
showed up around the same time?</font>

97
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:06,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard came early
to help the caterers set up.</font>

99
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. And you and your husband, Richard,
work at a real estate firm in Boston?</font>

100
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. It's... It's my company.</font>

101
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Right. Sorry.</font>

102
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I built my business from the ground up.</font>

103
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, just like your father.</font>

104
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two were very close.</font>

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We... We had our own secret way
of communicating.</font>

106
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you had to find that... with Dad.</font>

107
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had to find a game to play with him,</font>

108
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if you did that,
and you played by his rules...</font>

109
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everyone idolizes their dad, right?</font>

110
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. Do they?</font>

111
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very much not.</font>

112
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't know why I said that.</font>

113
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But my wife, Linda, does.</i></font>

114
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Harlan started out
with a rusty Smith Corona</i></font>

115
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:56,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and built himself into one of the
best-selling mystery writers of all time.</i></font>

116
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, seems like all his kids
are self-made overachievers.</font>

117
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

118
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the record,
I'm speaking with Walt Thrombey,</font>

119
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan Thrombey's youngest son.</font>

120
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you run your father's
publishing company?</font>

121
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's my... It's our...</font>

122
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the family's publishing company.</font>

123
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad trusts me to run it.</font>

124
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">30 languages.</font>

125
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over 80 million copies sold.
A real legacy.</font>

126
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys fans?</font>

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I don't do much
fiction reading myself, but...</font>

128
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Big fan. I'm a big fan.</font>

129
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, his plots are just like...</font>

130
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I won't spoil it for you but...
Okay, like Thousand Knives?</font>

131
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cow and the shotgun.</font>

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, where do you come up with that?</font>

133
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Dad said the plots just popped
into his head, fully formed.</font>

134
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was the easy part for him.</font>

135
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're in the area, right?</font>

136
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, you guys probably arrived
around the same time.</font>

137
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all got here around 8:00.</font>

138
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My wife, Donna, she's my rock.</i></font>

139
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, Donna! Are you all right?</font>

140
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>My son, Jacob, he's 16.</i></font>

141
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Very politically active.</i></font>

142
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The boy is literally a Nazi.</font>

143
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's an alt-right troll dipshit.</font>

144
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids today with the Internet,
it's amazing.</font>

145
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the night went well?</font>

146
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I mean, we're all gutted, but...</i></font>

147
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I was happy to have that night with him.</i></font>

148
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To be by his side,</i></font>

149
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to think about our books
and what we've accomplished with them.</i></font>

150
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like I can still feel his hand
on my shoulder.</font>

151
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Passing the torch.</font>

152
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, we're here with Joni Thrombey,</font>

153
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan Thrombey's daughter-in-law?</font>

154
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I married his son, Neil.</font>

155
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We had one daughter, Meg.</font>

156
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then Neil passed on 15 years ago.</font>

157
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you remained close to the Thrombeys?</font>

158
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're my family.</font>

159
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I feel simultaneously freed by</i></font>

160
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and supported by them.</i></font>

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's that balance of opposites
that's the nugget of Flam.</font>

162
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, the nugget of...</font>

163
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Flam.</font>

164
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, Flam,
your skin care company. Sorry.</font>

165
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I forgive you.</font>

166
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's skin care,
but it promotes a total lifestyle.</font>

167
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Self-sufficiency with an acknowledgement
of human need.</font>

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:25,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Flam.</font>

169
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's also Harlan.</font>

170
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got me and Meg
through some tough times.</font>

171
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granddad gives my mom a yearly allowance</font>

172
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he's never missed wiring
a tuition payment to my schools.</font>

173
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's a genuinely selfless man.</font>

174
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you left the party early?</font>

175
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have fun.</font>

176
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To see some friends at Smith.</i></font>

177
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know Dad pays for her
crypto-Marxist-post-deconstructural-</font>

178
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">feminist-poetry-theory-whatever major?</font>

179
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She could have stuck around for the cake.</font>

180
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I think Linda was upset.</i></font>

181
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Harlan understood.</font>

182
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You two showed up to the party
around the same time...</font>

184
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I could pause?</font>

185
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I just...</font>

186
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is that guy?</font>

187
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And why are we doing all this again?
- These are just some follow-up questions.</font>

188
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're attempting to be thorough,
so we can figure out the manner of death.</font>

189
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So by "manner of death,"
you mean if someone killed him?</font>

190
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If one of us killed him?</font>

191
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,176
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- One of his family killed him?
- No, Walt... Walt, no, no.</font>

192
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that what you're suggesting,
Lieutenant?</font>

193
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's saying that, okay?
This is all pro forma.</font>

194
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

195
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So who the fuck is that?</font>

196
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Benoit Blanc.</font>

197
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Benoit Blanc?
- Yes.</font>

198
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Blanc is a private investigator
of great renown.</font>

199
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

200
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read a tweet about
a New Yorker article about you.</font>

201
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"The Last of the Gentlemen Sleuths."</font>

202
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You solved that case
with the tennis champ.</font>

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're famous.</font>

204
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Blanc is not
with the police department</font>

205
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and not officially involved in the case,</font>

206
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he's offered to consult.</font>

207
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I happily obliged,
and I can vouch for him.</font>

208
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Blanc, I know who you are.</font>

209
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I read your profile in the New Yorker.</font>

210
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found it delightful.</font>

211
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just buried my 85-year-old father
who committed suicide.</font>

212
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you here?</font>

213
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here at the behest of a client.</font>

214
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

215
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot say.</font>

216
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But let me assure you of this.</font>

217
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My presence will be ornamental.</font>

218
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You will find me a respectful,</font>

219
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">quiet, passive observer...</font>

220
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the truth.</font>

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fine.</font>

222
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we getting there?</font>

223
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nearly. Um...</font>

224
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan's nurse, she was at the party
in a professional capacity?</font>

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta?</font>

226
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess.</font>

227
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Harlan hired her to be around to take care
of whatever medical needs popped up.</i></font>

228
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But really, she's like part of the family.</i></font>

229
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Good kid.</i></font>

230
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Been a good friend to Harlan.</i></font>

231
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Family's from Paraguay.</i></font>

232
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Linda really likes her work ethic.</font>

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Immigrants. We get the job done."</font>

234
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I...
- From Hamilton.</font>

235
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Hamilton.</font>

236
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's so good.</font>

237
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I saw it at The Public.
- Oh!</font>

238
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">May I just...</font>

239
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then I'll recede, but...</font>

240
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as a self-made man myself,</font>

241
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to express my admiration</font>

242
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for how you followed
in your father's footsteps.</font>

243
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- Just marvelous.</font>

244
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, the whole family too.</font>

245
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Joni with her thing,</font>

246
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Walt with his publishing empire...</font>

247
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's...</font>

248
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

249
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I mean, Walt, he's done well</font>

250
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with what Dad gave him.</font>

251
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that it matters.</font>

252
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But really, Dad hands him a book
twice a year and Walt publishes it.</font>

253
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just not the same.</font>

254
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But surely Walt runs
the merchandising, adaptations,</font>

255
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">film and television rights, I mean...</font>

256
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you baiting me, Detective?</font>

257
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know he doesn't.</font>

258
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:24,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you think I am dumb enough</font>

259
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to be baited into talking family business,</font>

260
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into shit-talking my baby brother
in front of a police detective</font>

261
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a state trooper...</font>

262
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt doesn't run shit.</font>

263
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because there are no TV and film rights.</font>

264
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan never allowed
any adaptations of his books.</font>

265
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hated the idea.</font>

266
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

267
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

268
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Drives Walt nuts.
'Cause that's where the real money is.</font>

269
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When Walt would get
a little Irish courage in him,</font>

270
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>he'd get into it with Harlan.</i></font>

271
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he "get into it" at the party?</font>

272
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God!</font>

273
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Dad!</font>

274
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Wouldn't leave him alone, the poor guy.</i></font>

275
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Harlan finally had to give him the hook.</i>
- ...their business affair guy...</font>

276
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I didn't hear what he said,</i></font>

277
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but he must've really
handed him his lunch.</i></font>

278
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>'Cause Walt was like a wounded puppy
the rest of the night.</i></font>

279
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Richard said what?</font>

280
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Jesus. We did not get "into it."</font>

281
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just trying to get
an accurate impression.</font>

282
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan took you aside at the party.</font>

283
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:23,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When you returned, you were chastened.</font>

284
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did Harlan say to you?</font>

285
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Netflix guys,
their business affair guy.</font>

286
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sent something over.
It's hard numbers this time.</font>

287
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I just think this is a window
that's not gonna stay open.</font>

288
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to take advantage of it and then
you just need to look at the numbers!</font>

289
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, Walt, look...
- Dad! Dad!</font>

290
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You... You put me in charge of our books.</font>

291
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me be in charge!
Let me do this! Please!</font>

292
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're not our books, son.</font>

293
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're my books.</font>

294
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And this is not how I wanted
to have this conversation.</font>

295
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're right, you're right. It's...</font>

296
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's unfair of me to keep you tethered</font>

297
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:05,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to something that isn't yours to control.</font>

298
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

299
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I've done you a grave disservice.</font>

300
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All these years,</font>

301
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:18,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've kept you from building something
of your own that was yours.</font>

302
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:25,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you're not going to be running
the publishing house anymore.</font>

303
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're free of it.</font>

304
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wh...</font>

305
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, are you firing me?</font>

306
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I...</font>

307
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll talk details tomorrow.</font>

308
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mind's made up.</font>

309
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good boy.</font>

310
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We talked. We had
a business discussion about e-books.</font>

311
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus. It was nothing.</font>

312
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want to talk about an argument,
hell, Ransom had an argument with him.</font>

313
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom, that's...</font>

314
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard and Linda's son?</font>

315
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, we all love Ransom.
He's a good kid. We love him.</font>

316
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But?</font>

317
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he's always been
the black sheep of the family.</font>

318
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm not trying to...</font>

319
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like to keep stuff like this
in the family.</font>

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But with Ransom, he's never had a job.</font>

321
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Dad, for some unknown reason,
always supported him.</font>

322
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have this love-hate bond. They fight.</font>

323
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that night, God, they had a blowout.</font>

324
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About what?</font>

325
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you goddamn insane?</font>

326
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,349
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We couldn't make it out really,
but it was huge.</i></font>

327
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And it's strange they went
into another room to do it.</i></font>

328
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Usually they like to stoke up drama
in front of the whole family.</i></font>

329
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of getting into it...</font>

330
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were at the house early
to help the caterers set up. Did...</font>

331
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you converse with Harlan at that time?</font>

332
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, he was there. We must have spoke.</font>

333
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In his study?</font>

334
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think so.</font>

335
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see,
I spoke with the caterer this morning.</font>

336
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't see you helping her staff.</font>

337
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did hear Harlan in a screaming match</font>

338
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with somebody that afternoon in his study.</font>

339
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I don't... Screaming match?</font>

340
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

341
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Joni was here too.</font>

342
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was early, so it might have been her.</font>

343
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe ask her.</font>

344
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">These were two male voices.</font>

345
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Harlan shouted the phrase...</i></font>

346
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You tell her or I will!</font>

347
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You tell her...</font>

348
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">or I will."</font>

349
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:42,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bells ringing?</font>

350
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's none of your business.</font>

351
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You stay out of my marriage.</font>

352
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know my daughter,
and she would want to know.</font>

353
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've put all of it in this letter to her.</font>

354
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow, she gets it.</font>

355
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan, I'm warning you.</font>

356
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, she deserves to know.
- Stay out of my marriage.</font>

357
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She deserves to know,
and you're gonna tell her.</font>

358
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The hell I am!
- You tell her or I will!</font>

359
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I know.</font>

360
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

361
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan had finally decided
to put his mom in a nursing home,</font>

362
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Linda had always opposed that.</font>

363
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I wanted to wait until we got back
to Boston to tell Linda,</font>

364
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so to avoid a whole scene,</font>

365
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Harlan wanted me to tell her then.</font>

366
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was it.</font>

367
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry. Forgot.</font>

368
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The house?</font>

369
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Earlier. Richard said you were there.</font>

370
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was at the house early.</font>

371
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see Harlan?</font>

372
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To see Harlan.</font>

373
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

374
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you seeing Harlan about?</font>

375
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was just a mix-up with the...</font>

376
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the payment for Meg's tuition.</font>

377
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm... I'm...</font>

378
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry to press,</font>

379
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what kind of mix-up?</font>

380
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, the school hasn't got the check yet.
I don't know why Alan didn't mail it.</font>

381
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Alan didn't mail it
because he caught a discrepancy.</font>

382
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan's office has been wiring tuition
directly to the school</font>

383
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">as per your request.</font>

384
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:30,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Phyllis's office that handles
your yearly allowance</font>

385
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has been wiring tuition monies
directly to you as well.</font>

386
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have been double-dipping Meg's tuition
and stealing from me...</font>

387
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...$100,000 a year,</font>

388
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the past 4 years.</font>

389
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan, I don't know
how this mix-up happened,</font>

390
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but I swear to God...
- So, now I am writing</font>

391
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this tuition check, but you must know
that this is the last money</font>

392
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you or Meg will get from me.</font>

393
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please, you don't understand...</font>

394
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joni, I know it'll hurt,</font>

395
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it's all for the best.</font>

396
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mind's made up.</font>

397
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a money wiring issue</font>

398
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with the office at the school.</font>

399
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I had to ask Harlan
to cut a check for the semester.</font>

400
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No big deal.</font>

401
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

402
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't we, uh, just take
a little break and we'll resu...</font>

403
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

404
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's gone.</font>

405
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard!</font>

406
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joni, have you seen Richard?</font>

407
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I was just done with the...
- Okay, thanks.</font>

408
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

409
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn it. Richard!</font>

410
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard?</font>

411
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son of a bitch.</font>

412
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See, I might be a victim
of my own expectation here,</font>

413
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:34,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but when the great Benoit Blanc
comes knocking at my door,</font>

414
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I expect it's going to be about something,
if not extraordinary,</font>

415
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then at least interesting.</font>

416
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'm sorry,
this is an open-and-shut case of suicide</font>

417
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and quite frankly, Benny,
we're getting to the point</font>

418
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where I need to know
what we're doing here.</font>

419
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The method?</font>

420
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Throat slit?</font>

421
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Typical for a suicide?</font>

422
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, I mean, that's dramatic.</font>

423
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But look around.</font>

424
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, the guy practically lives
in a Clue board.</font>

425
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Benny, talk to me, all right?</font>

426
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you tell me to invite
all of these people back</font>

427
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for questioning all over again.</font>

428
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it.</font>

429
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've had boots on the ground
in this county for a while.</font>

430
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are generally what they seem to be.
Not gonna find murderers in this family.</font>

431
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:24,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a pleasant family
with the usual quarrels,</font>

432
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but no possible motives for murder.</font>

433
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are you going?</font>

434
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan Thrombey's nurse. Marta...</font>

435
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cabrera.
- Marta Cabrera. Please.</font>

436
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Cabrera, you can just wait inside</font>

437
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and we'll be with you in...
- Miss Cabrera.</font>

438
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been doin' a little pokin'.</font>

439
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were hired on a part-time basis
as a registered nurse, yes?</font>

440
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. I don't work for a VNA.</font>

441
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan hired me directly.</font>

442
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take a seat, please.</font>

443
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're paid a flat rate for...</font>

444
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how many hours a week?</font>

445
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I started at 15, and then he...</font>

446
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he needed more help.</font>

447
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Medical help?</font>

448
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He needed a friend.</font>

449
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does having a kind heart
make you a good nurse?</font>

450
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, Blanc, I mean, this is...</font>

451
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:26,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. Marta? We were just discussing
possible motives in the family.</font>

452
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suspect that Harlan has told you
much unfiltered truth about each of 'em.</font>

453
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And a little bird has told me...</font>

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">how shall I put this delicately?</font>

455
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have a regurgitative reaction
to mistruthin'.</font>

456
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who told you that?</font>

457
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is it true?</font>

458
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

459
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's something I've had since I was a kid.</font>

460
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a physical thing that I...</font>

461
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just the thought of lying...</font>

462
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it makes me puke.</font>

463
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

464
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is Richard havin' an affair?</font>

465
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do men instinctively
pull at loose threads on their parachutes?</font>

466
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

467
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard?</font>

468
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- An affair?
- Yeah.</font>

469
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A yes or no will do.</font>

470
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

471
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

472
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- Dear girl, I'm sorry.</font>

473
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I assumed you were speaking figuratively.</font>

474
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I have Wet-Naps in the car.
- All right, here.</font>

475
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just take a sip of this.</font>

476
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take that.</font>

477
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's quite somethin'.</font>

478
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thanks.
- But I was obviously right.</font>

479
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard is having an affair.</font>

480
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His father-in-law found out
and confronted him.</font>

481
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You tell her or I will."</font>

482
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, but even if that were the case...
You all right?</font>

483
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Even if that were the case, I mean,</font>

484
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">protecting a relationship as a motive,
that's weak sauce.</font>

485
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know that.
- Well, then there is Joni.</font>

486
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Joni?
- Joni?</font>

487
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lifestyle guru JJoni? No.</font>

488
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,816
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan was supporting her and her daughter
and that's the opposite of a motive.</font>

489
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if that support was threatened...
Miss Cabrera, one moment, please.</font>

490
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes, I just wanna get some Scope.
- Miss Cabrera...</font>

491
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was Harlan plannin' on
cutting off Joni's allowance?</font>

492
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Joni.</font>

493
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>

494
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

495
00:26:42,041 --> 00:26:44,601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, don't answer that
if you're gonna puke again, please.</font>

496
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meg said he paid the school directly.</font>

497
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joni said he sent the money to her.</font>

498
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Both were true.</font>

499
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was pocketing the double payment.</font>

500
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan found out
and cut her off without a cent. Yes?</font>

501
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So she bumps him off for the inheritance?</font>

502
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, no, have you seen her Insta?
She's an influencer.</font>

503
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Allowance as a motive?
Again, more weak sauce.</font>

504
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're just dumpin' that vat
of weak sauce on me.</font>

505
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granted. But she lied to me.</font>

506
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All 3 of them did.</font>

507
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3?</font>

508
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walter.</font>

509
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see where you're going with this.</font>

510
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan had turned Walter down before
regarding film rights,</font>

511
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but that night,
somethin' Harlan said shook him.</font>

512
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now we look at the pattern.</font>

513
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan was cleanin' house.</font>

514
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No wonder.</font>

515
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he plan to fire Walter?</font>

516
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I just wait inside?
I feel like I shouldn't be here.</font>

517
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, please, just wait inside.
Stay close, all right?</font>

518
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have been very patient, my friend.</font>

519
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yes,</font>

520
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you are right.</font>

521
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of these weak alibis
and domestic squibbles</font>

522
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">answer your question,</font>

523
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Why is Benoit Blanc here?"</font>

524
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, now I will tell you why.</font>

525
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:02,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm here because this mornin',
someone dodged a very important question.</font>

526
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:04,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who?</font>

527
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me.</font>

528
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Linda asked who hired me.</font>

529
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, who hired you?</font>

530
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do not know.</font>

531
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An envelope of cash showed up
at my apartment yesterday</font>

532
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a news clippin' of Thrombey's death.</font>

533
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An envelope? That worked?</font>

534
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An envelope of cash.</font>

535
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So somebody suspects foul play</font>

536
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and goes through
this ha-cha dance of hiring me,</font>

537
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of staying anonymous.</font>

538
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It makes no damn sense.</font>

539
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Compels me, though.</font>

540
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walk me through everyone's whereabouts
at the time of death.</font>

541
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know that the party ended around 11:30.</font>

542
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good night, Joni.
- Night.</font>

543
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Marta took Harlan upstairs
to give him his meds.</i></font>

544
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:59,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The stairs leading up to Harlan's bedroom
and his attic office creak horribly</i></font>

545
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and Linda is a light sleeper.</i></font>

546
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So we know every time
someone took the stairs that night.</i></font>

547
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The first was when Joni heard a ka-thunk</i></font>

548
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>from somewhere above her in the house.</i></font>

549
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She's concerned about Harlan,
so she goes up to investigate.</i></font>

550
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Waking Linda.</i></font>

551
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Harlan was in his attic office with Marta.</i></font>

552
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hi, JJoni.
- I just... Hi.</font>

553
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He explained that they had
knocked over the Go board.</i></font>

554
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,736
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just knocked over the Go board, so...</font>

555
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That game with the grid and stones.</i></font>

556
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They play it every night.</i></font>

557
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He was fine. "Go to bed."</i></font>

558
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go to bed, Joni.</font>

559
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Love you. Night.
- Love you.</font>

560
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:44,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- So she did.</i>
- Bye.</font>

561
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>10 minutes later,
Linda is awoken a second time.</i></font>

562
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>By Marta leaving.</i></font>

563
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt, I'm leaving.</font>

564
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:57,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Walt was smokin' a cigar
on the porch with his son.</i></font>

565
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He saw her leave and drive off.</i></font>

566
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Noted the time.</i></font>

567
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Midnight.</i></font>

568
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>15 minutes later,</i></font>

569
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Linda is awoken for the third
and final time...</i></font>

570
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...by someone coming down the stairs.</i></font>

571
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Harlan, who came down
for a midnight snack.</i></font>

572
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad, go back to bed.</font>

573
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Which Walt tried to discourage.</i></font>

574
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Based on this, the medical examiner
determined the time of death</i></font>

575
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to be between 12:15 and 2:00 a.m.</i></font>

576
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>As Walt was finishing his cigar
at about 12:30, Meg came home.</i></font>

577
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She went straight to bed.</i></font>

578
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Walt and Jacob
turned in shortly after that.</i></font>

579
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And sometime later that night,</i></font>

580
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>it's undetermined,
but possibly near 3:00 a.m.,</i></font>

581
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Meg woke up because
the dogs were barking outside.</i></font>

582
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She used the bathroom, went back to bed.</i></font>

583
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it. All right?</font>

584
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, everyone's stories matched,</font>

585
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">every moment accounted for.</font>

586
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there is no other staircase
up to Harlan's room?</font>

587
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:04,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None. Just the creaky one.</font>

588
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Interesting.</font>

589
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, uh, we know that Ransom didn't do it</font>

590
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because he wasn't there.</font>

591
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta couldn't have.</font>

592
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan was still alive when she left.</font>

593
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Meg...</font>

594
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meg came home during the window
of the time of death, right?</font>

595
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except it was a suicide, all right?</font>

596
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan slit right through his carotid.</font>

597
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We saw from the blood splat patterns
that they were uninterrupted,</font>

598
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">meaning it's almost impossible for anyone
to have been around him at the time.</font>

599
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's the one who cut his own throat.
I don't know why we keep goin' over this.</font>

600
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Physical evidence can tell a clear story
with a forked tongue.</font>

601
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- And as we can see from this mornin',</font>

602
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everyone can lie.</font>

603
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, almost everyone.</font>

604
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Cabrera...</font>

605
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We kept you waiting all afternoon,
because I wanted to hear from you last.</font>

606
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:01,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I needed an entire picture
of the evening in my head,</font>

607
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your piece of it
is at its very center.</font>

608
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, please, take your time.</font>

609
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took Mr. Thrombey upstairs at 11:30</font>

610
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and left at midnight.</font>

611
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think very carefully
and with as much detail as possible.</font>

612
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell us what happened in that half hour?</font>

613
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up, up, up, I got it.
- You got it?</font>

614
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up, up, up, I got it.
Up, up, up, I got it.</font>

615
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Okay, that's...</font>

616
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Hey, Harlan.</font>

617
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Up, up, up, I got it.
- Let's...</font>

618
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up, up, up, I got it.</font>

619
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- No second thoughts.</font>

620
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no, no.</font>

621
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get up here!
- I had a glass of champagne.</font>

622
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harlan, listen to me.
- We are...</font>

623
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's late. I had...
- You only had one glass.</font>

624
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly. A glass of champagne.</font>

625
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are not breaking tradition
on my birthday!</font>

626
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,096
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you just take your goddamn medicine
and go to bed?</font>

627
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're gonna put that vile shit in me,
you have to earn it.</font>

628
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On my birthday.</font>

629
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God.
- 85th birthday.</font>

630
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:06,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fine. Jesus!
- I'm so old.</font>

631
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,037
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm so old.
- You really love drama, huh?</font>

632
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, let's do this. 9-by-9.</font>

633
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right.
- You ready?</font>

634
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll whip your ass.
- Are you sure?</font>

635
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Yeah.</font>

636
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How dare you.</font>

637
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how this is gonna end.</font>

638
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

639
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I beat you at this game?</font>

640
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I'm not playing to beat you.
I'm playing to build a beautiful pattern.</font>

641
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's elder abuse.</font>

642
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call the AARP.</font>

643
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make me get the belt, abuelo.</font>

644
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's basically over.</font>

645
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My only hope
is that an earthquake will strike.</font>

646
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what are the chances?</font>

647
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

648
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Hello?</font>

649
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,631
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello? Get under a door frame!</font>

650
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

651
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Such a bad loser you are! Meds, then bed.</font>

652
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm done with you.</font>

653
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fair.</font>

654
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt is smoking that filthy cigar
out there on the porch.</font>

655
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dead and nasty things.</font>

656
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How was tonight?</font>

657
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight was... good.</font>

658
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah?</font>

659
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,272
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you weren't looking forward to it.</font>

660
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. But I did it.</font>

661
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cut the line on all four of 'em.</font>

662
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

663
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't easy.</font>

664
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This goddamn fortune.</font>

665
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, sometimes I think
that everything I've given my family,</font>

666
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've done maybe</font>

667
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">without knowing,
or maybe to keep them beneath me.</font>

668
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I certainly should have...</font>

669
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, encouraged Walt</font>

670
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to write his own stories, not just be...</font>

671
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">a caretaker of mine.</font>

672
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like you said I should.</font>

673
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then be a father
and not just a provider</font>

674
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for Joni, like you also said.</font>

675
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I could have been kinder
to Linda and Ransom.</font>

676
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus! Ransom.</font>

677
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's so much of me in that kid.</font>

678
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Confident. Stupid.</font>

679
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, protected.</font>

680
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Playing life like a game,
without consequence.</font>

681
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until you can't tell the difference</font>

682
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between a stage prop...</font>

683
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a real knife.</font>

684
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I don't fear death.</font>

685
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But, oh, God,</font>

686
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to fix some of this before I go.</font>

687
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Close the book with a flourish.</font>

688
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we'll see.</font>

689
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we will.</font>

690
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

691
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:01,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had a long day.</font>

692
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna do drugs?</font>

693
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean the good stuff?</font>

694
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah?</font>

695
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, come on, send me to la-la land.</font>

696
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a tiny bit, okay?</font>

697
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did I wait till my mid-age
to become a morphine user?</font>

698
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a schmuck.</font>

699
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What a nudnik. This...</font>

700
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This stuff is the best.</font>

701
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

702
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is there a problem?</font>

703
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what I just gave you
100 milligrams of.</font>

704
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I messed up.</font>

705
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:44,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave me 100 milligrams
of the good stuff?</font>

706
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:50,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me, but what is the good stuff's
dosage supposed to be?</font>

707
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's not call it that right now, okay?</font>

708
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 milligrams.</font>

709
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, that's much less.</font>

710
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what happens?</font>

711
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna give you
an emergency shot of Naloxone,</font>

712
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you don't die in 10 minutes.</font>

713
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, well, no pressure.</font>

714
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, this is an interesting</font>

715
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and efficient method of murder.</font>

716
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to write this down.</font>

717
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if someone switched
the meds on purpose,</font>

718
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be dead in 10 minutes.</font>

719
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Like stone-cold dead?
- Yes.</font>

720
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll feel symptoms in 5.</font>

721
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweats, disorientation, and then...</font>

722
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. That big dose injected,
within 10, your...</font>

723
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your brain...</font>

724
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, 10 minutes.</font>

725
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From the moment of injection?</font>

726
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's eight-ish now.</font>

727
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And even if the victim called
for an ambulance</font>

728
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when he first felt the symptoms</font>

729
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and if he lived in a great
big country house like we do,</font>

730
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:46,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the ambulance would take
at least 15 minutes to arrive</font>

731
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then it'd be too late.</font>

732
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the victim didn't have
the emergency Naxostuff.</font>

733
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta?</font>

734
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do you have the Naxostuff?
- Yes, I'm gonna find it.</font>

735
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have it because it comes with the kit,
so it should be here. It has to be.</font>

736
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like...</font>

737
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not here, Harlan.</font>

738
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know why it's not here.</font>

739
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm gonna use the phone, okay?</font>

740
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To call an ambulance.</font>

741
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

742
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

743
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, listen to me.</font>

744
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harlan, I need to call the ambulance.
- Stop this, Marta!</font>

745
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There's no time! You have to listen!
- I'm calling the family!</font>

746
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

747
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you nuts?</font>

748
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harlan, we have to call the ambulance.
- Listen to me. Listen to me!</font>

749
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, if what you said is true, I'm gone.
There's no saving me.</font>

750
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.</font>

751
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have 6 minutes.</font>

752
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I can't...
- We have got to get you out of this!</font>

753
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think of your mom.</font>

754
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mom?</font>

755
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, get behind me, get behind me.</font>

756
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make a noise.</font>

757
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan?</font>

758
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta?</font>

759
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything all right?</font>

760
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, hi, Joni.
- I thought I... Hi.</font>

761
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought I heard something.
Is everything okay?</font>

762
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. We're fine. We're fine.</font>

763
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I just knocked over this Go board.
Sorry about that.</font>

764
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Everyone's all right?
- Yeah, fine.</font>

765
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no. Go to bed, Joni.</font>

766
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

767
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe we can talk tomorrow
about the family...</font>

768
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow's fine.</font>

769
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good night. Love you. Night.
- Love you. Bye.</font>

770
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:51,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

771
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pay attention, now.</font>

772
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your mom is still undocumented.</font>

773
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if this is your fault,</font>

774
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she'll be found out and at best deported,</font>

775
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and your family will be broken.</font>

776
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're not gonna let that happen,
are we, huh?</font>

777
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you have to do exactly
what I tell you.</font>

778
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you do this, Marta?</font>

779
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This last thing...</font>

780
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for me, for your family?</font>

781
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want me to do?</font>

782
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Go downstairs as noisily as you can</i></font>

783
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and then say goodbye loudly.</i></font>

784
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt, I'm leaving.</font>

785
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Call attention to the time...</i>
- God, it's midnight already.</font>

786
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...if you can.</i></font>

787
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Drive out the gate.</i></font>

788
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then to avoid the security cameras,</i></font>

789
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>pull off the road
before the carved elephant.</i></font>

790
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait. Was it before or after?
<i>- After the carved elephant.</i></font>

791
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he said before. Was it?</font>

792
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Beafterfore the carved elephant.</i>
- Oh, shit.</font>

793
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Park, and come back
on foot up to the house.</i></font>

794
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Take the side yard pass
through the little gate.</i></font>

795
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:07,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The dogs will know you.
They shouldn't bark.</i></font>

796
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You've got to get up to the third floor
without being seen.</i></font>

797
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And the only way
is to climb the side trellis</i></font>

798
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and come in through the trick hall window.</i></font>

799
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta be kidding me.</font>

800
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I am not. Do it.</i></font>

801
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And for God's sake, don't make any noise!</i></font>

802
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Once you're inside,
and this is the tricky part...</i></font>

803
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This is the tricky part?</i></font>

804
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Get my robe and cap from my bedroom</i></font>

805
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and put them on.</i></font>

806
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Harlan...</i></font>

807
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:55,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is crazy.
I don't think I can do that.</font>

808
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we need to make this so airtight
that the average cop</font>

809
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will entirely dismiss you as a suspect.</font>

810
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It sounds crazy, but it'll work.</font>

811
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Walt is smoking outside, and he'll see you</i></font>

812
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>through the glazed window.</i></font>

813
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad? Go back to bed.</font>

814
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You were seen leaving.</i></font>

815
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The security cameras show you driving off.</i></font>

816
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And 20 minutes later,</i></font>

817
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm seen alive and well by my son.</i></font>

818
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:29,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You see,
you've gone from suspect number one</i></font>

819
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to an impossibility.</i></font>

820
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Leave the way you came</i></font>

821
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:35,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and don't be seen.</i></font>

822
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom?</font>

823
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:51,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you back again already?</font>

824
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Drive home.</i></font>

825
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And sometime in the next few days,
the police will question you.</i></font>

826
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, no.</font>

827
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I can't lie!</font>

828
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:07,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know I can't lie! I'll puke!</font>

829
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:10,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then don't lie.
Tell fragments of the truth.</font>

830
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In this exact order.</font>

831
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I took him upstairs.</font>

832
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We played our nightly game of Go.</font>

833
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At some point, he knocked the board over</font>

834
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Joni came up to check on us.</font>

835
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave him pain medication.</font>

836
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He pulled his shoulder last week.</font>

837
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I left him in his study.</font>

838
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At midnight</font>

839
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said goodbye to Walt...</font>

840
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:50,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">went home.</font>

841
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of medication did you give him?</font>

842
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:00,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since his injury, I've been giving him
100 milligram IV push of Toradol.</font>

843
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,593
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a non-narcotic analgesic.</font>

844
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And to help him sleep,</font>

845
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:07,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS">3 milligrams of morphine.</font>

846
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the family was aware of this?</font>

847
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, of course.</font>

848
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:14,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you notice anything strange
or off about his demeanor?</font>

849
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:19,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

850
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that sounds about right.</font>

851
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:28,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you, Miss Cabrera.</font>

852
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, sis, people are gonna get here
for the memorial pretty soon.</font>

853
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you...</font>

854
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you all right?</font>

855
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was just thinking about Dad's games.</font>

856
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This all feels like one.</font>

857
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:06,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like something he'd write, not do.</font>

858
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I keep waiting for the big reveal.</font>

859
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where it'll make sense.</font>

860
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wouldn't that be nice?</font>

861
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:17,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Walt.</font>

862
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,839
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I don't think he killed himself.</i></font>

863
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:25,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't. I really don't.</font>

864
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's this Hallmark movie</font>

865
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">called Deadly by Surprise
with Danica McKellar.</font>

866
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in it, she plays this wife
who's getting poisoned by her husband,</font>

867
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but he's doing it little by little,
so she doesn't know it</font>

868
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and she goes crazy, and she kills herself.</font>

869
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And my cousin, who's a receptionist
at the medical examiner's office,</font>

870
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">she says that stuff totally happens.</font>

871
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not even 3% as crazy as
the stuff she's seen come through there.</font>

872
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:48,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, I'm just like...</font>

873
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, yeah!</font>

874
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, don't like him
because you love him.</font>

875
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I don't like him. He's an asshole.</font>

876
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But maybe an asshole is what we needed.</font>

877
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, yeah,</font>

878
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">an asshole is what Germany needed</font>

879
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- in 1930-whatever.
- Here we go.</font>

880
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Joni, those two things
don't even conflate.</font>

881
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There is the problem right there.
- Jesus.</font>

882
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:12,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna disappear
until the politics talk is done.</font>

883
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want some champers?</font>

884
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,238
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't. I'm technically working.</font>

885
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you take off your red cap,
Richard, and look around you?</font>

886
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The streets are literally
flooded with Nazis.</font>

887
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:22,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. No, no, no.</font>

888
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are losing our way of life
and our culture.</font>

889
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's right.
- There are millions</font>

890
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- of Mexicans coming.
- Oh, God, really?</font>

891
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't make this a race thing.
You always make this a race thing.</font>

892
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:34,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would say the same thing
if they were European immigrants.</font>

893
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah? So, if the Swiss were, like,</font>

894
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- clogging in the streets...
- No, we allow them in</font>

895
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they think they own what's ours.</font>

896
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're putting children in cages!
I mean, these are camps!</font>

897
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Joni,
nobody's saying that isn't bad,</font>

898
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the parents have some blame here.</font>

899
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, for what? For wanting
a better life for their kids?</font>

900
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Isn't that what America is...
- For breaking the law!</font>

901
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My God.
- You're gonna hate hearing this,</font>

902
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but it's true, America is for Americans.
- Don't point at me.</font>

903
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where's Marta? Is she still here? Marta!
- Oh, God, don't.</font>

904
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on over.
- No, Richard.</font>

905
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on over, Marta. Please.
- You're shitting me.</font>

906
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta,</font>

907
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">your family is from Uruguay,
but you did it right.</font>

908
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, what I'm saying is
they did it legally.</font>

909
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:16,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She did it the right way.</font>

910
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You work hard, and you'll earn your share
from the ground up.</font>

911
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:24,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like Dad and like all the rest of us.
And I'll bet you agree with me, right?</font>

912
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:26,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, just leave the poor girl alone,
Richard.</font>

913
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay! I just wanna hear
what she has to say!</font>

914
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay, Marta, you can speak.</font>

915
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweetheart, don't feel
pressure to answer. This is just...</font>

916
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

917
00:47:33,721 --> 00:47:36,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Please don't.
- If you wanna become an American,</font>

918
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there are legal ways to do it.</font>

919
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if you break the law,
it doesn't matter how good your heart is,</font>

920
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you gotta face the consequences!</font>

921
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you goddamn insane?</font>

922
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:49,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's done.
- Hey! I'm warning you.</font>

923
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:58,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's when I ask her, "Tonya,
what is wrong with people?" Literally.</font>

924
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Marta, what?</font>

925
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta?</font>

926
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the matter?</font>

927
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa. Hey. Breathe.</font>

928
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my gosh.
- Marta, are you okay?</font>

929
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Fran, do you still have your stash?</font>

930
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take 'em whenever you need 'em.</font>

931
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're just drying out
since you gave me that Juul.</font>

932
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks, Fran.</font>

933
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey. Hey.
- I'm sorry.</font>

934
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, just...
- I'm sorry.</font>

935
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:27,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm very, very sorry.</font>

936
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop saying you're sorry. Jesus!
- I hate this.</font>

937
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, my heart won't stop. I can't...</font>

938
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's just everything... No, thank you.</font>

939
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:40,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where Fran keeps her stash?</font>

940
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's gonna open a clock?</font>

941
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you want dinner, Nana?</font>

942
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dinner? To eat?</font>

943
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- To eat?
- Walt.</font>

944
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nana?
- Walt, Walt, she's fine.</font>

945
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She ate the entire salmon spread already.</font>

946
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt? Did you tell Marta yet,
what we all talked about?</font>

947
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, not yet. Is now a good time?</font>

948
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:03,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes, a very good time, right now.</font>

949
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, okay.</font>

950
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Calm down.</font>

951
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:10,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta,</font>

952
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,709
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we've been talking it over and...</font>

953
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Have you been smoking grass?
- No.</font>

954
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:19,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

955
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, we've been talking it over,</font>

956
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:23,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the whole family,</font>

957
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we'd like to take care of you.</font>

958
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wha... What does that mean?</font>

959
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We all think that you deserve something.</font>

960
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Financially we'd like to help you out.</font>

961
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were never anything but good to Dad</font>

962
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and because of that we...</font>

963
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can count on us.</font>

964
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:43,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

965
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I thought you should've been
at the funeral.</font>

966
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By the way, I was outvoted.</font>

967
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:02,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective.</font>

968
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're still here?</font>

969
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know Harlan?</font>

970
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knew my father,
who was a police detective years ago.</font>

971
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:20,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father respected Harlan.</font>

972
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That says quite a lot.</font>

973
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:24,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that why you're here?</font>

974
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here now, here?</font>

975
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:29,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

976
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stayed hoping to speak to you
a little more.</font>

977
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something is afoot with this whole affair.</font>

978
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it.</font>

979
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I believe you know it, too.</font>

980
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're gonna keep digging?</font>

981
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan's detectives, they dig.</font>

982
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,638
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They rifle and root.</font>

983
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Truffle pigs.</font>

984
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I anticipate the terminus
of Gravity's Rainbow.</font>

985
00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:05,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Gravity's Rainbow?</i></font>

986
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a novel.</font>

987
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:08,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know.</font>

988
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I haven't read it though.
- Neither have I.</font>

989
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nobody has. But I like the title.</font>

990
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:19,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It describes the path of a projectile
determined by natural law.</font>

991
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Et voila, my method.</font>

992
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I observe the facts
without biases of the head or heart.</font>

993
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I determine the arc's path,
stroll leisurely to its terminus,</font>

994
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:33,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the truth falls at my feet.</font>

995
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:39,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The medical examiner was ready
to rule this a suicide,</font>

996
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:42,198
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but Elliott agreed to keep it pending
for 48 hours.</font>

997
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow morning,
I search the grounds and the house,</font>

998
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">begin my investigation.</font>

999
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want you to be by my side for it.</font>

1000
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- My confidante.</font>

1001
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- My eyes and ears.
- Hey. Wait, wait, Detective. Why me?</font>

1002
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I trust your kind heart.</font>

1003
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, you're the only one who had nothing
to gain from Harlan's death.</font>

1004
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how about it, Watson?</font>

1005
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Detective?</font>

1006
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you want my insight into the family...</font>

1007
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">None of them are murderers.</font>

1008
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my insight.</font>

1009
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet,</font>

1010
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be it cruel or comforting,</font>

1011
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:22,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this machine unerringly
arrives at the truth.</font>

1012
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it does.</font>

1013
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always?</font>

1014
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tomorrow at 8:00.</font>

1015
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I know I've missed something.
There's gonna be something I missed.</i></font>

1016
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- Harlan. No, I can't.
- But I know you can do this.</i></font>

1017
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Without losing your soul,
you have to do what you have to do...</font>

1018
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- ...to beat this and win.</font>

1019
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:11,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan, I can't.</font>

1020
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You can. And you have to.
- No.</font>

1021
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For me.</font>

1022
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right now!</font>

1023
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan, I have to get you help.</font>

1024
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:42,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do as I say...</font>

1025
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and everything will be just fine.</font>

1026
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1027
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- I promise.</font>

1028
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But...</font>

1029
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:03,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">50 years ago, I worked this estate.</font>

1030
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:06,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, security back then was such that</font>

1031
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you had to make the rounds with a 94
and keep your ears open.</font>

1032
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:16,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now you've got all this modern technology.</font>

1033
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's the video there.</font>

1034
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:22,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saved the tape from that night.</font>

1035
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Normally, I erase 'em
with a magnetic degausser,</font>

1036
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:29,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but in this case,
I thought I'd just save it, you know?</font>

1037
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For security.</font>

1038
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, that's a live feed there.</font>

1039
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>To avoid the security cameras,</i></font>

1040
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>pull off the road
after the carved elephant.</i></font>

1041
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, well,
can we see the actual tape?</font>

1042
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, of course you can.</font>

1043
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I recorded it SSLP.</font>

1044
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's 8 hours in that tape.</font>

1045
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">9:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m.</font>

1046
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a Japanese horror movie.</font>

1047
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think we could scan forward on that?</font>

1048
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we all gonna die in 7 days?</font>

1049
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:06,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can we scan forward?</font>

1050
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, just hold the play button down</font>

1051
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:12,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and press FF until you hear it grind.</font>

1052
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:20,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Should be coming up now</font>

1053
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the time when the party ended.</font>

1054
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened?</font>

1055
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta keep holding it down
or else it'll eject.</font>

1056
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:32,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That thing eats tapes like popcorn.</font>

1057
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:35,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think your guys can digitize this
so we could scan it properly?</font>

1058
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think we can do that.</font>

1059
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

1060
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know all these statues
that you see around here?</font>

1061
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're all straight out of his series,
The Menagerie Tragedy Trilogy.</font>

1062
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pretty cool.
- Awesome.</font>

1063
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1064
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benny, it's beautiful out here,</font>

1065
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but do you really think someone broke
into the house and murdered Harlan?</font>

1066
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that why we're out here?
- It is unlikely,</font>

1067
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:00,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if they did, there will be traces.</font>

1068
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I can hang on to that.
- Yeah.</font>

1069
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Wagner, you got any luck on...</font>

1070
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:17,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uh, what's-his-name?
- Ransom?</font>

1071
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- No.</font>

1072
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did get an address though.</font>

1073
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah?
- 10 Kenoak Street.</font>

1074
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10... Kenoak?</font>

1075
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kenoak.</font>

1076
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:32,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a pleasant thing to say, isn't it?</font>

1077
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kenoak.</font>

1078
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I awoke amid Kenoak.</font>

1079
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's funny. Ken-oh-kia.
- All these leaves and mud,</font>

1080
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:42,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they're really gonna do
a number on my boots, man.</font>

1081
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mud. Did it rain the past week
or something?</font>

1082
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, stay there!
- What?</font>

1083
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1084
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1085
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got footprints here, so, uh...</font>

1086
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna, um...</font>

1087
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta.</font>

1088
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop.
- What?</font>

1089
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1090
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, stay there.</font>

1091
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- No, Marta! Stay there, Marta.</font>

1092
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:02,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No! No!
- I couldn't hear. If you...</font>

1093
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did you call me?
- All right.</font>

1094
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:05,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Excuse me. Come here.
- All right.</font>

1095
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,376
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're gonna need to call the boys,
have 'em come down here,</font>

1096
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:09,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">take a look at all these tracks.</font>

1097
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:12,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get it taped off. Stay on that side.
- I'm sorry.</font>

1098
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch out.
- Okay.</font>

1099
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Yeah!</font>

1100
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hussie? Hussie, hey.</font>

1101
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:22,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Best judge of character is a dog.</font>

1102
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Good boy.
- I've found that to be true.</font>

1103
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd...</font>

1104
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:30,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

1105
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:32,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My puppies!</font>

1106
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, they've got plans
to read the will at around 10:00,</font>

1107
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:39,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so the whole family will be here soon.</font>

1108
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I've never been to a will reading.
- Oh, well...</font>

1109
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think it'd be like a game show,</font>

1110
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but think of a community theater
production of a tax return.</font>

1111
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, what are we looking for?</font>

1112
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you know,</font>

1113
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:58,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">anything suspicious
or out of the ordinary.</font>

1114
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'll know it when you see it.</font>

1115
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:02,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1116
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sweet beans!</font>

1117
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1118
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.</font>

1119
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think you could handle the study?</font>

1120
00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:36,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's your medical bag?</font>

1121
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I left it here.</font>

1122
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always leave it here
with Harlan at night.</font>

1123
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They must have taken it in as evidence.
I'll look into that.</font>

1124
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1125
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:55,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd the Go board get knocked over?</font>

1126
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:57,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We were just goofing around.</font>

1127
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you thinking?</font>

1128
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:18,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No, no, no! Hey! Hey! Hey!</font>

1129
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:19,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, let me guess.</font>

1130
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:21,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Stop. Stop.</font>

1131
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:23,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop. Stop.</font>

1132
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hugh Drysdale?</font>

1133
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:29,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom. Call me Ransom.
It's my middle name.</font>

1134
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:31,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only the help calls me Hugh.</font>

1135
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- This is Trooper Wagner.</font>

1136
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Lieutenant Elliott.</font>

1137
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:38,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We just wanna ask a few questions.</font>

1138
01:00:42,800 --> 01:00:44,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

1139
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:46,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sir?</font>

1140
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:47,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're officers of the law!</font>

1141
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:51,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna run me in?
I don't feel like talking. I'm distraught.</font>

1142
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Benny, you wanna ask
this guy some questions?</font>

1143
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:56,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What is this? What's this arrangement?
- Mr. Drysdale.</font>

1144
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">CSI KFC?</font>

1145
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:07,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Frannie,
how about a glass of cold milk?</font>

1146
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:08,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, asshole.</font>

1147
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not her name, not her job.</font>

1148
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Meg. How's the SJW degree coming?</font>

1149
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Trust fund prick.
- All right, guys.</font>

1150
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:18,149
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1151
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:19,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Everyone.</font>

1152
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna be
in the other room, setting up.</font>

1153
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be ready in 10 minutes.</font>

1154
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,791
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Funny, Ransom, you skipped the funeral,
but you're early for the will reading.</font>

1155
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, people grieve in different ways.
Let's not...</font>

1156
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:40,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
It's funny you're here at all.</font>

1157
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you even bothering?
That's what I'm asking myself.</font>

1158
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that supposed to mean?</font>

1159
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He knows what it's supposed to mean.</font>

1160
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:48,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait... Walt, what?</font>

1161
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:53,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob was in that bathroom
the night of the party.</font>

1162
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's where you were all night?</font>

1163
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell were you doing
in the bathroom all night?</font>

1164
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nothing.
- Swatting Syrian refugees?</font>

1165
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, I was not.
- Alt-right troll.</font>

1166
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Liberal snowflake.</font>

1167
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:06,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what any of that means.</font>

1168
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It means your son's a little creep.</font>

1169
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My son's a creep?</font>

1170
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:12,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, just...</font>

1171
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt, he was in the bathroom.</font>

1172
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, he was in the bathroom.</font>

1173
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:18,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Joylessly masturbating
to pictures of dead deer.</font>

1174
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:22,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, Richard? You wanna go?</font>

1175
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bet, skippy, let's go.</font>

1176
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna go? Come on!</font>

1177
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better watch out, man.</font>

1178
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:29,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No!
- Stop!</font>

1179
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, I have been waiting
for this my whole life!</font>

1180
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop it, right now!
- Donna, I can handle myself!</font>

1181
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop it!
- I can handle it.</font>

1182
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1183
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:39,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta do this more often.</font>

1184
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:40,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1185
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob.</font>

1186
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:44,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know where this is going.</font>

1187
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:46,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were in the bathroom
next to Harlan's office,</font>

1188
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where he had the fight with Ransom.</font>

1189
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, you heard something.</font>

1190
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:50,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Spill it.</font>

1191
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:54,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just heard two things.</font>

1192
01:02:58,200 --> 01:02:59,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...my will.</font>

1193
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:00,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"My will."</font>

1194
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:04,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then there was more yelling.</font>

1195
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then I heard Ransom say...</font>

1196
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm warning you."</font>

1197
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom...</font>

1198
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's that mean?</font>

1199
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it means our father
finally came to his senses</font>

1200
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:22,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and cut this worthless little brat
out of his will.</font>

1201
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:25,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I guess you're gonna have
to sell the Beemer</font>

1202
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:29,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and give your notice at the country club
and kick whatever fashion drug you're on.</font>

1203
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because if you think
that after all the bridges you've burned,</font>

1204
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after all the shit you said,</font>

1205
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after everything that you put
this family through</font>

1206
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:37,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the last 10 years,</font>

1207
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:40,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that any of us are gonna support you,</font>

1208
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:44,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that any of us are gonna give you,
like Dad liked to say,</font>

1209
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"a single red dime,"</font>

1210
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:48,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're nuts!</font>

1211
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:50,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow.</font>

1212
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son...</font>

1213
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:55,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Father.</font>

1214
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:59,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Harlan tell you
he was gonna cut you out of the will?</font>

1215
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:02,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep.</font>

1216
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, then he's done
what none of us were strong enough to do.</font>

1217
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe this might finally make you grow up.</font>

1218
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This might be the best thing
that could ever happen to you.</font>

1219
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:23,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.
My mother, ladies and gentlemen.</font>

1220
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, this is not gonna be easy for you,</font>

1221
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but it'll be good.</font>

1222
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing good is ever easy.</font>

1223
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:30,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up your ass, Joni.</font>

1224
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've had your teeth
in this family's tit for a long time.</font>

1225
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Up your ass"? Oh, very nice.</font>

1226
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Matter of fact, eat shit.
- Oh, my God, Ransom.</font>

1227
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,670
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- How's that?</font>

1228
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please do not use that word
in front of my son.</font>

1229
01:04:40,600 --> 01:04:42,496
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- In fact, eat shit. Eat shit.
- If I wasn't practicing...</font>

1230
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:43,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Eat shit.
- You entitled prick!</font>

1231
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would slap that smug smile...</font>

1232
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Definitely eat shit.
- ...off your goddamn face!</font>

1233
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:48,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat shit. You can all eat shit.</font>

1234
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not eating one iota of shit!</font>

1235
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was that about
will readings being boring?</font>

1236
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The exception that proves the rule.</font>

1237
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Asshole.</font>

1238
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm warning you."</font>

1239
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,151
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom said, "I'm warning you."</font>

1240
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:13,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, you heard Ransom in there.
That's the kind of thing he says.</font>

1241
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want this? You want this?</font>

1242
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:22,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do we have here?</font>

1243
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This looks like a relatively fresh break.</font>

1244
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yep. Right there.</font>

1245
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:35,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute.</font>

1246
01:05:35,560 --> 01:05:37,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that doesn't make sense.</font>

1247
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:39,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's that window?</font>

1248
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:42,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about some more cookies, Hugh?</font>

1249
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want some more cookies?
- That's great.</font>

1250
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, maybe Harlan left you
a cold glass of milk in his will. Asshole.</font>

1251
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Show me. But stay off the carpet.</font>

1252
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the trick window</font>

1253
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from A Kill For All Seasons.</font>

1254
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:14,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trooper, here, will you? Take this.</font>

1255
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:29,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Traces of dried mud.</font>

1256
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:32,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suspect they go
the length of the hallway.</font>

1257
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Footprints?</font>

1258
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, just traces.</font>

1259
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, depending on when
this thing was last cleaned,</font>

1260
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this could have happened
at any time, right?</font>

1261
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:45,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that would not explain this.</font>

1262
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:48,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Analyze that mud.</font>

1263
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:49,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It will match these traces.</font>

1264
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take this to Jamie.
- You will find similar samples</font>

1265
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">leading up the trellis
on the outside of the house.</font>

1266
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">On the night of the party,</font>

1267
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">somebody who did not want
to be heard climbing those steps</font>

1268
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS">went to a great deal of trouble
to break into Harlan Thrombey's rooms.</font>

1269
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The game is afoot, eh, Watson?</font>

1270
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, thank you all
for getting together like this.</font>

1271
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,311
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It isn't legally necessary,</font>

1272
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:26,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I thought because you're all in town,
and some of you are leaving soon...</font>

1273
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me.</font>

1274
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:29,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1275
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen,
I would like to gently request</font>

1276
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:36,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you all stay in town
until the investigation is completed.</font>

1277
01:07:37,080 --> 01:07:38,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, he's gently requesting,</font>

1278
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm gonna have to make that an order.</font>

1279
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:42,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one move until we figure this all out.</font>

1280
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Can we ask why?</font>

1281
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Has something changed?
- No.</font>

1282
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it hasn't changed?
Or no, we can't ask?</font>

1283
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:50,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Stevens...</font>

1284
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you may continue.</font>

1285
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Well...</font>

1286
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:57,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other reason I thought
this gathering would be beneficial</font>

1287
01:07:57,600 --> 01:08:02,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is because Harlan altered his will
a week before he died.</font>

1288
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He sealed it.</font>

1289
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:06,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He asked me not to submit it to the courts</font>

1290
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:08,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for probate until after his death.</font>

1291
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, if anyone is confused about anything,</font>

1292
01:08:11,240 --> 01:08:13,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're all together, we can talk.</font>

1293
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Although I don't imagine any of it
is going to be that complicated.</font>

1294
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:19,792
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan's assets included...</font>

1295
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The house.
- The house,</font>

1296
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which he owned outright.</font>

1297
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Um...
- $60 million.</font>

1298
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:30,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. $60 million in various cash accounts
and investments.</font>

1299
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:32,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And of course,</font>

1300
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:33,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the real asset,</font>

1301
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">sole ownership of Blood Like Wine,
his publishing company.</font>

1302
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He also wrote up a statement
when he was making the changes</font>

1303
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and he wanted that read first.</font>

1304
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Dearest Linda, Walter, and Joni,</font>

1305
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:51,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of you may be surprised
by the choice I've made here.</font>

1306
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No pleasure was taken in the exclusion.</font>

1307
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And its purpose was not to sow
greater discord in the family,</font>

1308
01:08:57,680 --> 01:08:58,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">quite the opposite.</font>

1309
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:02,957
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please accept it with grace
and without bitterness, but do accept it.</font>

1310
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's for the best. Dad."</font>

1311
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:22,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Well, yeah, not too complex at all.</font>

1312
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This will be quick.</font>

1313
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:28,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I, Harlan Thrombey,
being of sound mind and body</font>

1314
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and yada, yada, yada...</font>

1315
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hereby direct that all my assets,
both liquid and otherwise,</font>

1316
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I leave in their entirety
to Marta Cabrera.</font>

1317
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:43,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My entire ownership
of Blood Like Wine publishing,</font>

1318
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera.</font>

1319
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:48,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The copyright of its catalog likewise</font>

1320
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I leave in its entirety to Marta Cabrera."</font>

1321
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:57,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

1322
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- No.</font>

1323
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:06,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's not... That's... No.
- No.</font>

1324
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That can't be.
Can I see that please, Alan?</font>

1325
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. It's right.
- Please.</font>

1326
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This can't be legal.
- It's right.</font>

1327
01:10:12,680 --> 01:10:14,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, he was...
- Oh, my God.</font>

1328
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Aren't there safeguards?
- There's a mistake.</font>

1329
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what to say.</font>

1330
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:19,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're his family, so...</font>

1331
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:20,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not possible.</font>

1332
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:22,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are there safeguards against this?</font>

1333
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wasn't in his right mind? Something...</font>

1334
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You know, Alan, listen.
- You know, he was on medication.</font>

1335
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Morphine? All right, morphine.</font>

1336
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:32,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, I don't know.</font>

1337
01:10:32,680 --> 01:10:34,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She seems like family...
- Alan, you can take</font>

1338
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:39,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this piece of paper and shove it
right up your ass, and get out!</font>

1339
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:40,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, you cops, too, out.</font>

1340
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Out! Right now.</font>

1341
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Linda?
- No, Richard, we need to talk.</font>

1342
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to fight this thing.
We're not going anywhere.</font>

1343
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I said get out!</font>

1344
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are the Thrombeys, goddamn it!</font>

1345
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:53,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is still our house!</font>

1346
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:02,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, sorry.</font>

1347
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:06,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Likewise the house at 2 Deerborn Drive
and all belongings therein,</font>

1348
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I leave to Marta Cabrera."</font>

1349
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:13,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you little bitch!</font>

1350
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:16,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You little bitch!
- Linda?</font>

1351
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you know about this?
Were you in on this from the beginning?</font>

1352
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is unbelievable!
- No, I just wanna know.</font>

1353
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:22,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were you... What were you doing?</font>

1354
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Were you boinking my father?</font>

1355
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Boinking"?
- No, no, no.</font>

1356
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:27,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think everybody just needs
to cool their jets.</font>

1357
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:30,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You had sex with my grandpa,
you dirty anchor baby!</font>

1358
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:31,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now hold your horses.</font>

1359
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:32,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And in the meantime, I'd maybe run.</font>

1360
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, wait, wait, Marta?</font>

1361
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Now, would you please...
- You need to talk to us.</font>

1362
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:38,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta?</font>

1363
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a minute. I totally understand how
you must be feeling right now.</font>

1364
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:43,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot leave!</font>

1365
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what to say. I don't know.</font>

1366
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Calm down. Calm down.
- Marta, please...</font>

1367
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, listen, darling...</font>

1368
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:53,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what's happening.
I don't know why he...</font>

1369
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:56,278
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I'm also confused. I need to think!</font>

1370
01:11:56,360 --> 01:11:58,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta! Are you listening?</font>

1371
01:11:58,440 --> 01:11:59,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't catch up!</font>

1372
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I understand.
- Richard! Open up that door!</font>

1373
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:05,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You are scaring her!
- I can't open the damn door!</font>

1374
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:07,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, go. Marta, go.</font>

1375
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:09,712
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, you have to understand.</font>

1376
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He is our father!</font>

1377
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:14,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Marta, listen to me.
- Don't listen to them. I'm here.</font>

1378
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not on Twitter anymore.</font>

1379
01:12:18,240 --> 01:12:20,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So DM me on Instagram, okay?</font>

1380
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:21,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I wanna talk to you.</font>

1381
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:27,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom!</font>

1382
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:29,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell's going on?</font>

1383
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:32,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this could be the best thing
to happen to all of you!</font>

1384
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does he mean by that?</font>

1385
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:39,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Richard, why didn't you stop her?</font>

1386
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I supposed to do?
Grab the bumper with my teeth?</font>

1387
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,671
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, seriously, though, what the hell?</font>

1388
01:12:59,720 --> 01:13:01,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. I'll take an extra bowl.</font>

1389
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:02,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1390
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:12,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like you're gonna pass out.
Have you eaten anything today?</font>

1391
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat.</font>

1392
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a nightmare.</font>

1393
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:22,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why?</font>

1394
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:26,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Why?
- Why?</font>

1395
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. This is everything.</font>

1396
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:33,456
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's gotta be a bigger reason why,
and you know it.</font>

1397
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, how about it had to do more
with you guys than with me?</font>

1398
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1399
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:42,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's the only thing
that makes sense.</font>

1400
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he tell you anything?</font>

1401
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only that I wasn't getting a cent.</font>

1402
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:53,016
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's because he wanted you
to build something from the ground up...</font>

1403
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:54,633
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Build something from the ground up."</font>

1404
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:56,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother built her business
from the ground up</font>

1405
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with a million-dollar loan
from my grandfather.</font>

1406
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,510
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My father owns none of it.
She made him sign a prenup.</font>

1407
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He lives in fear.</font>

1408
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know that's what my grandfather was
trying to protect me from by doing this</font>

1409
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I know I shouldn't say this out loud,
but when he told me, I...</font>

1410
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus.</font>

1411
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:14,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I coulda killed him.</font>

1412
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:20,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS">After I left the party though,
I was driving.</font>

1413
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:23,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nowhere, just in the night,
and I had this...</font>

1414
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:26,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">clarity.</font>

1415
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, from here on out,
I was gonna have to fend for myself.</font>

1416
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:32,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that felt...</font>

1417
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:35,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">good.</font>

1418
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The old bastard.</font>

1419
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, I know three things.</font>

1420
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:47,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One, I know he didn't commit suicide.</font>

1421
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:51,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What makes you think that?
- I don't think it.</font>

1422
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,550
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it.</font>

1423
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:55,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because I knew my granddad.</font>

1424
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe you and I were
the only two who knew him,</font>

1425
01:14:57,680 --> 01:14:59,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you're not gonna bullshit me
on this because, two...</font>

1426
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know lying makes you puke.</font>

1427
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:06,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause of that mafia game
last Fourth of JJuly.</font>

1428
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And three...</font>

1429
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:13,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you just ate
a full plate of baked beans and sausage.</font>

1430
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So...</font>

1431
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:20,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look me in the eye</font>

1432
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and tell me what happened
to my grandfather.</font>

1433
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:29,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You asshole.
- Marta.</font>

1434
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tell me everything.</font>

1435
01:15:36,080 --> 01:15:37,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alan, there have got to be options here.</font>

1436
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1437
01:15:39,160 --> 01:15:40,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know how many times</font>

1438
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can repeat the same
two pieces of information.</font>

1439
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Harlan was of sound mind
when he made the changes,</font>

1440
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:50,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and we all confirmed that he was...
- Would a sound mind do this?</font>

1441
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How... Sound, how?</font>

1442
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The very action speaks to unsoundness.</font>

1443
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:55,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not legally. No.</font>

1444
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:59,909
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You not liking what he did
does not speak to testamentary capacity.</font>

1445
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about undue influence?</font>

1446
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:04,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Undue influence.
How about that? Huh?</font>

1447
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just Google that?</font>

1448
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, if Marta was manipulating Dad
somehow and if we found out...</font>

1449
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If somehow, she had gotten
her hooks into him...</font>

1450
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a strong case for that.</font>

1451
01:16:14,720 --> 01:16:17,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Your Honor, she endeared herself to him</font>

1452
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:19,710
<font face="Comic Sans MS">through hard work and good humor."</font>

1453
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:21,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That won't cut the salami.</font>

1454
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about the slayer rule?</font>

1455
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:25,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did just Google that.</font>

1456
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:27,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The slayer rule obviously
doesn't apply here.</font>

1457
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:30,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, what the hell is the slayer rule?</font>

1458
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, it's if someone is convicted
of killing the person,</font>

1459
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:34,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they don't get their inheritance.</font>

1460
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:35,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not even convicted.</font>

1461
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even if they're held responsible
for their death in civil court.</font>

1462
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:39,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like O.J.?</font>

1463
01:16:40,600 --> 01:16:42,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, like O.J.</font>

1464
01:16:43,080 --> 01:16:45,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But Harlan committed suicide.</font>

1465
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Detective Blanc?</font>

1466
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:59,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You said the investigation is ongoing.
You made a point of that.</font>

1467
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:01,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you suspect foul play?</font>

1468
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Blanc, if you please...</font>

1469
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:09,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is much that remains unclear,
but yes,</font>

1470
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:13,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I suspect foul play.</font>

1471
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta?</font>

1472
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:18,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have eliminated no suspects.</font>

1473
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:21,629
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're full of shit.</font>

1474
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't trust this guy in the tweed suit.</font>

1475
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:26,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, Alan, God bless you, you're useless.</font>

1476
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1477
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:31,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's only one answer to this.
She has to renounce the inheritance.</font>

1478
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:33,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She knows it's what she should do.
- That's exactly what she...</font>

1479
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:34,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right? No way.</font>

1480
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:36,514
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the moral thing.</font>

1481
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mom.
- She'll do it.</font>

1482
01:17:38,240 --> 01:17:40,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If Granddad wanted to give Marta
everything, that's what he wanted.</font>

1483
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:42,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1484
01:17:42,360 --> 01:17:44,511
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This wasn't him. He loved us.</font>

1485
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted us taken care of.</font>

1486
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:48,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted you to have an education.</font>

1487
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meg,</font>

1488
01:17:50,160 --> 01:17:52,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you think I can pay for your school?</font>

1489
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:04,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1490
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just saying it, it sounds insane,
but it's all true.</font>

1491
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I think Blanc's been on to me
from the start.</font>

1492
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,711
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care if I go to jail, but my mom,</font>

1493
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:13,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my sister?</font>

1494
01:18:14,040 --> 01:18:15,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We...</font>

1495
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gonna say something?</font>

1496
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:23,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always thought I was the only one
that could beat him at Go.</font>

1497
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always thought that meant something.</font>

1498
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:28,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know you did.</font>

1499
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:30,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That night at the party,</font>

1500
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:32,597
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my last conversation with him...</font>

1501
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My last argument,
that's what he told me about you.</font>

1502
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That you beat him at Go
more than I do, and I thought...</font>

1503
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:43,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"What a strange thing to tell me."</font>

1504
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:46,989
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think I get it now.</font>

1505
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it did mean something.</font>

1506
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:58,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not gonna tell my family shit.</font>

1507
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:00,075
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not gonna go to jail.</font>

1508
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,038
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That detective is not gonna catch you.</font>

1509
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're not gonna give up the money.</font>

1510
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what Granddad wanted for you.</font>

1511
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think about what he did
to go through with this.</font>

1512
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He wanted this for himself,
he wanted this for the family.</font>

1513
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:13,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And he wanted it for you.</font>

1514
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:15,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've come this far.</font>

1515
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:18,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me help you go all the way.</font>

1516
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? This isn't you.</font>

1517
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:23,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You could just turn me in right now
and still get your cut of the inheritance.</font>

1518
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:24,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why?</font>

1519
01:19:25,520 --> 01:19:27,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because fuck my family.</font>

1520
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:30,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can help you get away with this.</font>

1521
01:19:30,680 --> 01:19:31,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then,</font>

1522
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're gonna give me
my cut of the inheritance.</font>

1523
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:38,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy ending. Everybody wins.</font>

1524
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, me, Harlan.</font>

1525
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:41,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1526
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:44,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Deal?</font>

1527
01:19:56,640 --> 01:19:58,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Meg.
<i>- Marta...</i></font>

1528
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>That was nuts.</i></font>

1529
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know.</font>

1530
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,395
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Are you okay?</i></font>

1531
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:07,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Are you?</font>

1532
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, I...</i></font>

1533
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,351
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Look, no one knows
I'm calling you, I just...</i></font>

1534
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,669
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I wanted to...</i></font>

1535
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:19,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I wanted to say sorry
for how everyone was.</i></font>

1536
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And...</i></font>

1537
01:20:22,440 --> 01:20:25,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess, I wanted to ask,
what are you gonna do?</font>

1538
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

1539
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Well, the...</i></font>

1540
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know, with the will,
what are you gonna do?</i></font>

1541
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think I should do?</font>

1542
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:43,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You should do whatever you think is right.</i></font>

1543
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:47,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I...</font>

1544
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you should give it back to us.</font>

1545
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:56,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Granddad always took care of us.</i></font>

1546
01:20:56,160 --> 01:20:57,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know, we're his family.</i></font>

1547
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:01,470
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And I know he was like family to you,
but we're his actual family.</i></font>

1548
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:02,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1549
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:04,472
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And look, Marta,</font>

1550
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you know this isn't fair.</font>

1551
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:08,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've always been good to you</font>

1552
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and you're like family,
and we'll take care of you,</i></font>

1553
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:13,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>but you have to make things right.</i></font>

1554
01:21:14,440 --> 01:21:15,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know what's right.</i></font>

1555
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Marta...</i></font>

1556
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:21,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mom's broke.</font>

1557
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And she says I'm gonna have
to drop out of school.</i></font>

1558
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. No, no, Meg.</font>

1559
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:29,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I won't let that happen.</font>

1560
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:32,111
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Whatever money you need,
I'll give it to you.</i></font>

1561
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I'm here for you. And I want you to know
I'm gonna take care of you,</i></font>

1562
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:36,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>I promise that.</i></font>

1563
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:37,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Okay?</i></font>

1564
01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:39,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks.</font>

1565
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:40,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And once I...</i></font>

1566
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:48,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sometimes I think it's a sin</i></font>

1567
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>When I feel like I'm winnin'
When I'm losin' again</i></font>

1568
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay then.</font>

1569
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:04,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did Blanc find anything suspicious
at the house?</font>

1570
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, he found mud upstairs.</font>

1571
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:12,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Where I broke in through the window.
- Shit.</font>

1572
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:13,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Identifiable prints?</font>

1573
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,435
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Good. Okay.</font>

1574
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good. Hey...</font>

1575
01:22:19,440 --> 01:22:22,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You lay low for a couple days,
wait for this investigation to blow over,</font>

1576
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:23,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it will.</font>

1577
01:22:23,760 --> 01:22:26,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause no matter how good this Blanc guy
thinks he is, he's got nothin'.</font>

1578
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, relax.</font>

1579
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:32,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, get your ass up!</font>

1580
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:35,576
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell is happening?
There's a guy here and a bunch of stuff.</font>

1581
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything's going crazy. Are we rich?</font>

1582
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:40,878
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe, Alice. I don't know.</font>

1583
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what that means,
but you better get your ass up, okay?</font>

1584
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,838
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>We don't know much about Marta Cabrera,</i></font>

1585
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:48,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>- or her exact relationship...</i>
- Oh, my God.</font>

1586
01:22:48,640 --> 01:22:50,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, what is all this?</font>

1587
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:51,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

1588
01:22:52,520 --> 01:22:54,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is that here?
- Oh, yeah, it is.</font>

1589
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:57,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, so is that true?</font>

1590
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we rich?</font>

1591
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:01,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>This is a story so compelling...</i></font>

1592
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:02,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1593
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,592
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>...it is as if he had written
the story himself.</i></font>

1594
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,358
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good morning, Mrs. Thrombey.</font>

1595
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:27,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why is grief the providence of youth?</font>

1596
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1597
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'd imagine
that age deepens all feelings.</font>

1598
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:40,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Including grief.</font>

1599
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:47,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This was a long walk
to offering condolences</font>

1600
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the loss of your son.</font>

1601
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:53,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And asking you,
if it isn't presumptuous of me,</font>

1602
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:57,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">not to think too harshly of your family...</font>

1603
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:03,309
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if I am, as I suspect,
the first to console you.</font>

1604
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,949
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're young, aren't they?</font>

1605
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:15,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One thing I assume of age</font>

1606
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is weariness.</font>

1607
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damned if I don't get
more tired every day.</font>

1608
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:23,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tired of what I do.</font>

1609
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Following arcs like lobbed rocks,</font>

1610
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the inevitability of truth.</font>

1611
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But the complexity and the gray...</font>

1612
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">lie not in the truth...</font>

1613
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:41,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but what you do with the truth
once you have it.</font>

1614
01:24:49,240 --> 01:24:52,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you have something
you wanna tell me.</font>

1615
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think you're very perceptive</font>

1616
01:24:56,840 --> 01:24:59,753
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and very capable
of telling me what you saw</font>

1617
01:25:00,120 --> 01:25:02,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the night of your son's party.</font>

1618
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I'll happily wait.</font>

1619
01:25:13,040 --> 01:25:14,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm in no rush.</font>

1620
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:16,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact,</font>

1621
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:20,630
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I find it quite pleasant
sitting here with you.</font>

1622
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lawyers were here.</font>

1623
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:31,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very big lawyers, it looked like.</font>

1624
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They left this stuff and business cards.</font>

1625
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And there was a pile of other stuff
when I got home.</font>

1626
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:38,873
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like any of this, Marta.</font>

1627
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't like it either.
I'm slipping out the back.</font>

1628
01:25:43,480 --> 01:25:45,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back later.
Please don't talk to anyone.</font>

1629
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:53,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt?</font>

1630
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:57,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I came...</font>

1631
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how you doin'?</font>

1632
01:26:01,160 --> 01:26:03,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Walt, I want you to know
that I didn't know about any of this.</font>

1633
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We know you didn't.
- This is...</font>

1634
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,509
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We know you didn't.</font>

1635
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,959
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we all kind of went
a little crazy yesterday.</font>

1636
01:26:10,040 --> 01:26:11,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Understandable.
- Yeah.</font>

1637
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,118
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I haven't even looked at all this yet.</font>

1638
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:17,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It must just be
local lawyers and accountants</font>

1639
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:20,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who saw the news
and wanna get a jump on it.</font>

1640
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:22,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. I'd be careful of all of it.</font>

1641
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:28,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, is it your intention
to renounce the inheritance?</font>

1642
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is what Harlan wanted.</font>

1643
01:26:36,640 --> 01:26:37,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but...</font>

1644
01:26:38,520 --> 01:26:40,716
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan put you in
a very hard position here.</font>

1645
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:42,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean... it was unfair of him.</font>

1646
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you see</font>

1647
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:48,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the kind of press and scrutiny
that this kicks up.</font>

1648
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we know, with your mother...</font>

1649
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:54,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My mother?</font>

1650
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1651
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did Meg tell you?</font>

1652
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:04,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't about...</font>

1653
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:07,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're missing the point.</font>

1654
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:09,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We don't wanna attack you with this,</font>

1655
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but, Marta, if your mother
came into the country illegally,</font>

1656
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">criminally,</font>

1657
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you've come into this inheritance,</font>

1658
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:19,032
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with all the scrutiny that entails,</font>

1659
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:20,713
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be afraid that could come to light.</font>

1660
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,318
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's what we wanna avoid here.</font>

1661
01:27:23,400 --> 01:27:24,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can protect you...</font>

1662
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">from that happening, or if it happens.</font>

1663
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:32,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you're saying that
even if it came to light,</font>

1664
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with your family's resources,
you could help me fix it?</font>

1665
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1666
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,517
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, with the right lawyers, you know?</font>

1667
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:40,829
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not these local guys,</font>

1668
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:43,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but New York lawyers, DC lawyers,</font>

1669
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:45,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with enough resources put toward it, yes.</font>

1670
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:49,317
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not that that ever even needs
to come up, but...</font>

1671
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">yes.</font>

1672
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:53,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, good.</font>

1673
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay?</font>

1674
01:27:57,720 --> 01:28:00,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause Harlan gave me all your resources.</font>

1675
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So that means with my resources,
I'll be able to fix it.</font>

1676
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I guess I will find the right lawyers.</font>

1677
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uh, Marta, that's...</font>

1678
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:12,479
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You better be sure that's...</font>

1679
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:15,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">what you want.</font>

1680
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,789
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No...</font>

1681
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I don't know... What's this?
- It's my medical bag tag.</font>

1682
01:28:56,680 --> 01:28:58,717
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They have my medical bag for some reason.</font>

1683
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:01,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, but this is a photocopy
of just the header</font>

1684
01:29:01,720 --> 01:29:04,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of a blood toxicology report on Harlan.</font>

1685
01:29:04,680 --> 01:29:06,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, this is gonna show
the morphine overdose.</font>

1686
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:11,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm screwed?</font>

1687
01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:14,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How do you know all this stuff?</font>

1688
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was Harlan's research assistant
for a summer.</font>

1689
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:20,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what kind of blackmail scheme is this?</font>

1690
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:23,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, the actual evidence is sitting
up the street, at the crime lab.</font>

1691
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no demands,
there's no meeting place.</font>

1692
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,193
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's the point in sending you this?</font>

1693
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:43,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It could be a half hour.
It could be an hour. It depends.</font>

1694
01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:44,549
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We wanna make sure...</font>

1695
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:54,599
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, it could take a while.
- What's the cheese?</font>

1696
01:29:54,680 --> 01:29:56,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, hey.
- Yeah.</font>

1697
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,594
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you, Chief.
- No problem.</font>

1698
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:58,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">5:00 a.m.</font>

1699
01:29:58,840 --> 01:30:00,797
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Security systems here are all triggered.</font>

1700
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, this thing went up really quick,</font>

1701
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:06,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so that means blood stores, records,
anything of that nature, it's all gone.</font>

1702
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:09,389
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There were no employees here,
so, thank God for that.</font>

1703
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about security cameras?</font>

1704
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:14,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah.</font>

1705
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:17,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Speaking of security,</font>

1706
01:30:18,040 --> 01:30:19,918
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the surveillance tape
at the Thrombey estate</font>

1707
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was all scrambled for some reason.</font>

1708
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:23,350
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1709
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's still pending from the autopsy?</font>

1710
01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:28,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a report on the blood work.</font>

1711
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,429
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blood work?</font>

1712
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

1713
01:30:41,200 --> 01:30:42,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is insane.</font>

1714
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, who would blow up
a whole real building</font>

1715
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:48,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just to blackmail me?</font>

1716
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:50,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, this means the blackmailer
has the only paper copy</font>

1717
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the thing that can prove your guilt.</font>

1718
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:55,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You didn't get any other instructions?
No phone call? No e-mail? Nothing?</font>

1719
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1720
01:30:57,480 --> 01:30:59,392
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I haven't checked my e-mail.</font>

1721
01:31:04,680 --> 01:31:05,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is one.</font>

1722
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:09,751
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's it.
"1209 Columbus Road. 10 a.m."</font>

1723
01:31:16,040 --> 01:31:18,321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what this means, right?
If you destroy that copy,</font>

1724
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:20,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're totally in the clear.</font>

1725
01:31:21,040 --> 01:31:22,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, no.</font>

1726
01:31:23,720 --> 01:31:25,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, did you hear me?</font>

1727
01:31:27,720 --> 01:31:28,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1728
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elliott!</font>

1729
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:39,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta go! We gotta go!</font>

1730
01:31:42,240 --> 01:31:44,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, Baby Driver.
- Oh, God.</font>

1731
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:47,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You regret helping me yet?
- I regret not taking the Beemer.</font>

1732
01:31:49,640 --> 01:31:51,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

1733
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:06,976
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Vehicles in pursuit on Washington Street.
- No force.</font>

1734
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,416
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Make sure you say "no force."
- No force.</font>

1735
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We got a possible murder suspect.
- I said that. I said that.</font>

1736
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go. Go! Go! Are you flooring it?</font>

1737
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:16,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am literally flooring it!</font>

1738
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:29,256
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is going well.
- I'm pulling over. I'm...</font>

1739
01:32:29,280 --> 01:32:31,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you miss your chance
to get this tox report, it's all over.</font>

1740
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:33,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1741
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:38,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1742
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:39,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why... Why are we stopping?</font>

1743
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,997
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you stopping
in the middle of the road?</font>

1744
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:56,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hold on.</font>

1745
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:22,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
I'm just pure adrenaline right now.</font>

1746
01:33:22,920 --> 01:33:24,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like I swallowed bees.</font>

1747
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:25,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1748
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:27,314
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So where is it? What's the address?</font>

1749
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">1209 Columbus Road.</font>

1750
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:30,718
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I mean, whatever they want,</font>

1751
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll say yes...
- Anything.</font>

1752
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, just to get that report back.</font>

1753
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Get it back and destroy it.
- Destroy it.</font>

1754
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:37,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit, Ransom.</font>

1755
01:33:38,120 --> 01:33:39,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, thank you.</font>

1756
01:33:40,520 --> 01:33:42,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I couldn't do this without you.</font>

1757
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:47,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.</font>

1758
01:33:48,240 --> 01:33:49,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get out.</font>

1759
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was the dumbest car chase
of all time.</font>

1760
01:33:54,720 --> 01:33:56,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your hands down.</font>

1761
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:58,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spoke to Wanetta Thrombey, Greatnana.</font>

1762
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:02,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Night of the party, she saw someone
climbing the trellis to the third floor.</font>

1763
01:34:03,160 --> 01:34:05,277
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mr. Drysdale, come on.
- Let's go.</font>

1764
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Pat him down, check him out.
- What's going on?</font>

1765
01:34:09,560 --> 01:34:12,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- "Ransom came back," she said.
- Hands on the vehicle.</font>

1766
01:34:12,520 --> 01:34:14,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what he came back to do,
but we'll find out.</font>

1767
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:16,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got anything sharp?</font>

1768
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:20,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Watch your head. Thank you.
- Hey, you don't need to thank him.</font>

1769
01:34:20,280 --> 01:34:23,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he ask you to drive
when he saw me coming?</font>

1770
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1771
01:34:33,760 --> 01:34:35,194
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blanc, coming with us?</font>

1772
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:36,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll drive with Marta.</font>

1773
01:34:37,640 --> 01:34:39,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go to the police station.</font>

1774
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:42,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want a full rundown
on everything he said to you.</font>

1775
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:44,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll catch you up on where we're at.</font>

1776
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:54,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strange case from the start.</font>

1777
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:58,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A case with a hole in the middle.</font>

1778
01:35:00,280 --> 01:35:01,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A doughnut.</font>

1779
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:05,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just talking through my process here.</font>

1780
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me know if this is boring.</font>

1781
01:35:07,720 --> 01:35:09,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel the noose tightening.</font>

1782
01:35:09,880 --> 01:35:12,315
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The family is truly desperate.</font>

1783
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:14,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Desperate motives.</font>

1784
01:35:15,360 --> 01:35:17,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The mystery of who hired me.</font>

1785
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:19,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The impossibility of the crime.</font>

1786
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And yet...</font>

1787
01:35:22,760 --> 01:35:24,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A doughnut.</font>

1788
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:27,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One central piece.</font>

1789
01:35:27,240 --> 01:35:30,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if it reveals itself,
the fog would lift,</font>

1790
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:34,519
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the arc would resolve,
the Slinky become unkinked.</font>

1791
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:36,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you mind if I stop for a second?</font>

1792
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:38,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I need to pick something up.</font>

1793
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be very quick.</font>

1794
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:42,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sure.</font>

1795
01:35:55,640 --> 01:35:56,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It'll be just a few minutes.</font>

1796
01:35:57,040 --> 01:35:58,235
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Watch the...</font>

1797
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">door.</font>

1798
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1799
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I don't know what you want.</font>

1800
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:53,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever it is, we can work it out.</font>

1801
01:36:54,120 --> 01:36:56,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we have to figure it out
right here, right now.</font>

1802
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:58,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm leaving with that report.</font>

1803
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1804
01:37:29,560 --> 01:37:30,755
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fran?</font>

1805
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:42,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no! Fran?</font>

1806
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:45,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, Fran.</font>

1807
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:46,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you hear me?</font>

1808
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:49,231
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fran, give me a sign if you can hear me.</font>

1809
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:51,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You...
- Yes, it's me. It's Marta.</font>

1810
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:53,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You called me here, you sent me an e-mail.</font>

1811
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's why I'm here.
Did you take something?</font>

1812
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna call an ambulance now.
You're gonna be okay.</font>

1813
01:37:58,160 --> 01:37:59,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're gonna be fine, okay? Stay with me.</font>

1814
01:37:59,960 --> 01:38:01,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Copy...
- What?</font>

1815
01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:02,316
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Copy...</font>

1816
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:04,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stashed...</font>

1817
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:05,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What are you saying?</font>

1818
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:08,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You did this.</font>

1819
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:11,397
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Won't get away with this.</font>

1820
01:38:11,480 --> 01:38:12,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus, stop it!</font>

1821
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,832
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>911, what's your emergency?</i></font>

1822
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:42,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The thought of you stays bright</i></font>

1823
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:49,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Sometimes I stand
In the middle of the floor</i></font>

1824
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not going left</i></font>

1825
01:38:55,880 --> 01:38:56,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Not going...</i></font>

1826
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,229
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, Lord.</font>

1827
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:02,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, my friend.
Thank you for the update.</font>

1828
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:05,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no need for that.</font>

1829
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:08,637
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bring her in once we get word
that the housekeeper is stable.</font>

1830
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's still touch and go.</font>

1831
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:11,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1832
01:39:13,120 --> 01:39:14,190
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, this is over.</font>

1833
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:15,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are getting hurt.</font>

1834
01:39:18,440 --> 01:39:19,760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I'm gonna tell you the truth.</font>

1835
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Young Ransom just told
Lieutenant Elliott everything.</font>

1836
01:39:24,040 --> 01:39:25,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good.</font>

1837
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:27,112
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, I hope he didn't cover for me.</font>

1838
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:28,680
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did he tell you the real truth</font>

1839
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:30,752
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- about me switching the...
- Yeah.</font>

1840
01:39:30,840 --> 01:39:32,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And the disguise bit?
- Yes.</font>

1841
01:39:32,200 --> 01:39:34,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And the whole blackmail and...</font>

1842
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,431
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why did Fran take my morphine?</font>

1843
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:39,830
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, obviously she had swiped
the bag from the house,</font>

1844
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:41,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she didn't seem like a user to me,</font>

1845
01:39:41,960 --> 01:39:43,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">unless that's why she needed
the blackmail money.</font>

1846
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:46,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. It doesn't matter anyway.</font>

1847
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:49,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have to tell the Thrombeys myself.
I feel like I owe that to them.</font>

1848
01:39:49,200 --> 01:39:50,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think that's a good idea.</font>

1849
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:52,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I have to do it. I need to do it.</font>

1850
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave the doctors my number,</font>

1851
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:58,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they'll call if anything
changes with Fran.</font>

1852
01:39:58,360 --> 01:39:59,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1853
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:02,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll round up the Thrombeys at the house,
along with a police escort.</font>

1854
01:40:03,240 --> 01:40:04,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For the arrest after.</font>

1855
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:07,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can tell me your whole story
on the drive over.</font>

1856
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,078
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want any more surprises.</font>

1857
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:30,476
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fran said it was stashed,
the copy, and then she said,</font>

1858
01:40:31,080 --> 01:40:33,276
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"You did this.
You won't get away with it."</font>

1859
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I called the ambulance.</font>

1860
01:40:36,680 --> 01:40:37,796
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

1861
01:40:39,080 --> 01:40:40,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1862
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:43,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ready?</font>

1863
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:51,835
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1864
01:40:52,400 --> 01:40:54,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, has she come to her senses?</font>

1865
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:56,776
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, she's standing right there, Richard.
She can speak for herself.</font>

1866
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is the rest of the family here?
- In the living room.</font>

1867
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think that it would be better if we were
to gather again and get this over with.</font>

1868
01:41:08,040 --> 01:41:09,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

1869
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:13,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry I told them about your mom.</font>

1870
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meg, it's okay.</font>

1871
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. No... I was scared.
I just... I didn't wanna tell them.</font>

1872
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:20,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get it.</font>

1873
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:21,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trust me.</font>

1874
01:41:22,520 --> 01:41:24,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I understand. It's all right.</font>

1875
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:26,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1876
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, I am so raiding
Fran's stash after this.</font>

1877
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I still think this is a bad idea,</font>

1878
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but the family is assembled.</font>

1879
01:41:41,480 --> 01:41:43,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where the tox report is.</font>

1880
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She basically told me where it was.</font>

1881
01:41:55,120 --> 01:41:56,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyways, this will tie everything up.</font>

1882
01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:00,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I just handed it to you.</font>

1883
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:04,790
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, you're not much
of a detective, are you?</font>

1884
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:06,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, to be fair...</font>

1885
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:11,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you make a pretty lousy murderer.</font>

1886
01:42:13,280 --> 01:42:14,953
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Perhaps we deserve each other.</font>

1887
01:42:27,240 --> 01:42:28,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You've always been good to me.</font>

1888
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what I'm about to say
isn't gonna be easy</font>

1889
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:34,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you're gonna be upset.</font>

1890
01:42:35,480 --> 01:42:38,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I thought after what you've
gone through the last few days,</font>

1891
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:41,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you deserved to hear it from me.</font>

1892
01:42:44,960 --> 01:42:46,189
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I...
- Excuse me!</font>

1893
01:42:50,680 --> 01:42:52,956
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have not been good to her.</font>

1894
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:55,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have all treated her like shit,</font>

1895
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:59,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to steal back a fortune that you lost
and she deserves.</font>

1896
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:03,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a pack of vultures at the feast!</font>

1897
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:04,958
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knives out, beaks bloody!</font>

1898
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:06,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1899
01:43:07,080 --> 01:43:09,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not getting bailed out,
not this time.</font>

1900
01:43:10,720 --> 01:43:14,794
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Miss Cabrera has decided, definitively,
not to renounce the inheritance.</font>

1901
01:43:15,320 --> 01:43:17,039
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- What?</font>

1902
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:20,158
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Furthermore, it will be
my professional recommendation</font>

1903
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:22,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to the local authorities
that the manner of death</font>

1904
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:26,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">in the case of Harlan Thrombey
is ruled as suicide!</font>

1905
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And the case is closed.
- Blanc?</font>

1906
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:30,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Thank you all for coming. Goodbye.</font>

1907
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:32,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Just tell me...</font>

1908
01:43:34,560 --> 01:43:37,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's certainly not what I was expecting.</font>

1909
01:43:37,280 --> 01:43:39,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- Is anybody else confused?</font>

1910
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not what I was expecting to hear at all.</font>

1911
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:46,056
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you gonna tell me
what the hell is going on?</font>

1912
01:43:46,080 --> 01:43:48,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes. Yes.
- I just wanna come clean, okay?</font>

1913
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:50,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's over.
- Almost.</font>

1914
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:51,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blanc, what are we doing?</font>

1915
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,150
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's going on?
- I'm sorry. Officer Wagner.</font>

1916
01:43:54,240 --> 01:43:57,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Keep the family out of this room,
and get 'em out of the house if you can.</font>

1917
01:43:57,400 --> 01:43:59,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But stand by with your additional officer.</font>

1918
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:00,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the family out?</font>

1919
01:44:00,680 --> 01:44:02,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, but not all of them. Would you...</font>

1920
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:03,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you.</font>

1921
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:04,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Blanc.
- Yes, sir.</font>

1922
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:06,274
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, what's all this drama?</font>

1923
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:08,033
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Indulge me.
- Blanc,</font>

1924
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:11,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told Ransom, Ransom told you,
and I'm telling you now,</font>

1925
01:44:11,720 --> 01:44:14,554
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it is an immovable fact
that I killed Harlan.</font>

1926
01:44:14,640 --> 01:44:17,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, you did. Yes, he did. Yes, you are.</font>

1927
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:20,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But... But, I spoke in the car
about the hole</font>

1928
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:22,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at the center of this doughnut.</font>

1929
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And what you and Harlan did
that fateful night</font>

1930
01:44:25,360 --> 01:44:28,512
<font face="Comic Sans MS">seems at first glance
to fill that hole perfectly.</font>

1931
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,354
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A doughnut hole in a doughnut's hole.</font>

1932
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:34,196
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we must look a little closer.</font>

1933
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:37,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And when we do, we see the doughnut hole</font>

1934
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:39,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">has a hole in its center.</font>

1935
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:42,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is not a doughnut hole,</font>

1936
01:44:42,120 --> 01:44:44,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but a smaller doughnut with its own hole</font>

1937
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and our doughnut is not whole at all!</font>

1938
01:44:47,960 --> 01:44:50,136
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Blanc, look, I understand
that this is amusing for you...</font>

1939
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:52,391
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why was I hired?</font>

1940
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:54,833
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would someone hire me?</font>

1941
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone fishing for a crime
to reverse the will. Come on.</font>

1942
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I was hired
before the sealed will was read.</font>

1943
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,518
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, yes, the person must have known
the contents of the will.</font>

1944
01:45:04,600 --> 01:45:06,000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But one step further.</font>

1945
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:08,993
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That same person must have known
a crime was committed,</font>

1946
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and further...</font>

1947
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:15,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If the intent was to reverse
Marta's inheritance,</font>

1948
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS">they must have known
that Marta was responsible.</font>

1949
01:45:19,160 --> 01:45:21,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">An intriguing combination of factors.</font>

1950
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:24,877
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone who knew what Marta did
wanted to expose it</font>

1951
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but could not reveal how they knew.</font>

1952
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,275
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fran!</font>

1953
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:31,114
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She was blackmailing me.
She knew what I did.</font>

1954
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:34,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, but Fran wanted money,
ergo she did not want the crime exposed.</font>

1955
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:37,896
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if someone in the family had observed
Marta doing something suspicious?</font>

1956
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:40,992
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But they would have had
no reason not to speak up.</font>

1957
01:45:42,760 --> 01:45:46,356
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The answer is not so simple.</font>

1958
01:45:46,920 --> 01:45:51,233
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now with the entire solution
in my field of view,</font>

1959
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:54,313
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the arc of this case
is a tragedy of errors.</font>

1960
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:58,990
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, it will not be easy
for you to hear.</font>

1961
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,195
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But there is at least</font>

1962
01:46:02,680 --> 01:46:05,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">one truly guilty party behind it all,</font>

1963
01:46:05,320 --> 01:46:08,438
<font face="Comic Sans MS">guilty in the true sense
of acting with malice</font>

1964
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:12,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and committing a heinous crime
with selfish intent.</font>

1965
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:16,109
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trooper Wagner.</font>

1966
01:46:16,200 --> 01:46:17,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trooper Wagner?</font>

1967
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:19,880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

1968
01:46:22,240 --> 01:46:24,357
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, I'm so sorry.
I told them everything.</font>

1969
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:25,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I figured it was up. I'm sorry.</font>

1970
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,390
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. It's all right, Ransom,
I'm glad you did.</font>

1971
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not exactly everything though.</font>

1972
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:32,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this about what Greatnana told you?</font>

1973
01:46:33,360 --> 01:46:36,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She saw me that night.
She mistook me for Ransom.</font>

1974
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:37,240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll get to that.</font>

1975
01:46:37,320 --> 01:46:38,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In the meanwhile,</font>

1976
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,591
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Hugh Ransom Drysdale,</font>

1977
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you might tell us all why you hired me.</font>

1978
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:50,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why I hired you?</font>

1979
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:54,837
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're right. Let's back it up
to the night of the party.</font>

1980
01:46:55,200 --> 01:46:57,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Your argument with Harlan.</i></font>

1981
01:46:57,800 --> 01:46:59,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What were the overheard words</font>

1982
01:46:59,280 --> 01:47:01,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">by the Nazi child
masturbating in the bathroom?</font>

1983
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:05,871
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"My will," and "I'm warning you."</i></font>

1984
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:08,475
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You and Harlan were drama mamas.</font>

1985
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You shared a love of twisting the knife
into one another.</font>

1986
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:14,558
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see, I don't believe
he would have slipped it in halfway.</font>

1987
01:47:14,640 --> 01:47:15,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1988
01:47:16,520 --> 01:47:17,590
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I submit</font>

1989
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:20,749
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan told you everything.</font>

1990
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be serious!</font>

1991
01:47:22,200 --> 01:47:28,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a red dime or word of my work
to a single one of them, you included.</font>

1992
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta,</font>

1993
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:33,516
<font face="Comic Sans MS">remind me what Ransom said
his conversation with Harlan ended with?</font>

1994
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Harlan told him that
I could beat him at Go.</font>

1995
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:40,152
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I asked myself, "Marta?</font>

1996
01:47:40,240 --> 01:47:44,757
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would the topic of the will
have steered around to Marta?"</font>

1997
01:47:46,120 --> 01:47:49,113
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is one obvious explanation.</font>

1998
01:47:49,200 --> 01:47:52,079
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't be that crazy. You're not
just gonna throw away your fortune.</font>

1999
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. I'm giving it to Marta.</font>

2000
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All of it.</font>

2001
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:57,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your Brazilian nurse?</font>

2002
01:47:58,000 --> 01:47:59,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you goddamn insane?</font>

2003
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:02,513
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sane for the first time in my life,
and I've done it.</font>

2004
01:48:02,600 --> 01:48:04,239
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you think I'm gonna let this happen,</font>

2005
01:48:04,320 --> 01:48:06,616
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- if you think I'll stand here...
- I've made the change to my will.</font>

2006
01:48:06,640 --> 01:48:08,632
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's done.
- I'm warning you!</font>

2007
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,673
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's some heavy-duty conjecture.</font>

2008
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:13,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Granted.</font>

2009
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:16,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it is the only way
what comes next makes sense.</font>

2010
01:48:17,720 --> 01:48:20,474
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you storm out,
you drive off into the night.</font>

2011
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:23,076
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You tell Marta later...</i></font>

2012
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:26,069
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was it?
Feeling an overwhelming sense of...</font>

2013
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:27,756
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Clarity.</font>

2014
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:31,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That he had to make do for himself
from here on out.</font>

2015
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:32,520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

2016
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:38,440
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Marta. The will. Harlan.</i></font>

2017
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,034
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Do for yourself."</i></font>

2018
01:48:40,120 --> 01:48:41,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"You won't get away with this."</i></font>

2019
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And a plan forms.</i></font>

2020
01:48:53,320 --> 01:48:54,436
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You return,</i></font>

2021
01:48:54,520 --> 01:48:57,319
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>careful to avoid the gate's
security camera range.</i></font>

2022
01:48:57,800 --> 01:49:00,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Then on foot up towards the house,</i></font>

2023
01:49:00,240 --> 01:49:02,072
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>you sneak in up the trellis,</i></font>

2024
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:04,595
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>so as not to be seen
by the rest of the family</i></font>

2025
01:49:04,680 --> 01:49:07,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>who are still having
their party downstairs.</i></font>

2026
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:12,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>What you need to do will take moments.</i></font>

2027
01:49:13,040 --> 01:49:16,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But it is essential
that you are alone and undetected.</i></font>

2028
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:19,995
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You knew what medications Harlan took.</i></font>

2029
01:49:20,080 --> 01:49:22,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You knew what Marta would be
injecting him with that night.</i></font>

2030
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,840
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And you knew</i></font>

2031
01:49:25,960 --> 01:49:29,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if Marta was responsible for his death,</font>

2032
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:31,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>even unintentionally,</i></font>

2033
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:35,473
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the slayer rule would nullify
the changed will</font>

2034
01:49:35,560 --> 01:49:37,677
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you would get your share back.</font>

2035
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You used the syringes in the kit</i></font>

2036
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:43,080
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to switch the liquids
in the two medication vials.</i></font>

2037
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:45,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And as a final precaution...</font>

2038
01:49:47,880 --> 01:49:50,031
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>you took the Naloxone,</i></font>

2039
01:49:50,560 --> 01:49:52,836
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the lifesaving antidote.</font>

2040
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No. No, no, no, that's impossible.</i></font>

2041
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the truth.</font>

2042
01:49:57,800 --> 01:50:00,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hand me that vial of morphine.
I'll show you.</font>

2043
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:02,750
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he did that, if the meds were switched,</font>

2044
01:50:03,360 --> 01:50:05,955
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then when I got them mixed up, I...</font>

2045
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I accidentally switched them back, so...</font>

2046
01:50:10,840 --> 01:50:12,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gave Harlan...</font>

2047
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:13,270
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The correct doses.</font>

2048
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:15,230
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

2049
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:19,160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But not accidentally.</font>

2050
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:23,952
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I taped over the label of these two vials.</font>

2051
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:27,919
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The vials themselves are identical.</font>

2052
01:50:30,640 --> 01:50:32,393
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How'd you know this was the morphine?</font>

2053
01:50:33,200 --> 01:50:34,634
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just knew.</font>

2054
01:50:34,720 --> 01:50:37,872
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew because there is the slightest,
almost imperceptible differences</font>

2055
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:40,236
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of tincture and viscosity
between the two liquids.</font>

2056
01:50:42,400 --> 01:50:46,030
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You knew because
you've done it a hundred times.</font>

2057
01:50:47,240 --> 01:50:49,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gave him the correct medication</font>

2058
01:50:49,560 --> 01:50:52,029
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because you are a good nurse.</font>

2059
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,556
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then Harlan was...</font>

2060
01:50:54,640 --> 01:50:56,552
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Marta. But yes.</font>

2061
01:50:58,120 --> 01:51:00,077
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Harlan was perfectly fine.
- Oh, my God.</font>

2062
01:51:01,240 --> 01:51:02,515
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His blood was normal.</font>

2063
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:07,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The cause of death was truly,
solely suicide,</font>

2064
01:51:07,680 --> 01:51:10,912
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you are guilty of nothing
but some damage to the trellis</font>

2065
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,559
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a few amateur theatrics.</font>

2066
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:17,553
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In fact, if Harlan had listened to you
and called the ambulance...</font>

2067
01:51:19,600 --> 01:51:20,795
<font face="Comic Sans MS">he would be alive today.</font>

2068
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:25,920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn!</font>

2069
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:27,434
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A twisted web.</font>

2070
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:30,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And we are not finished untangling it.</font>

2071
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:32,070
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not yet.</font>

2072
01:51:32,840 --> 01:51:36,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta, when Greatnana spotted you
climbing down the trellis, she said...</font>

2073
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:42,115
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom? Are you back again already?</font>

2074
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:44,999
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>"Are you back again already?"</i></font>

2075
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,355
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause earlier that night...</font>

2076
01:51:49,560 --> 01:51:51,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ransom, you're back?</font>

2077
01:51:54,360 --> 01:51:55,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Marta.</font>

2078
01:51:55,680 --> 01:51:57,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is "stoopid" with two O's.</font>

2079
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:00,696
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have a shred of evidence.
You're just spinning a fairy tale.</font>

2080
01:52:00,720 --> 01:52:02,234
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a shred, no.</font>

2081
01:52:02,760 --> 01:52:05,798
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just as we have no real proof
of Marta mixing up the vials,</font>

2082
01:52:05,880 --> 01:52:06,950
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so it's your word...</font>

2083
01:52:07,040 --> 01:52:08,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have her confession!</font>

2084
01:52:11,040 --> 01:52:12,269
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, yeah.</font>

2085
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,674
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we do have that.</font>

2086
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:16,991
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With your permission,
I'd like to spin a little further.</font>

2087
01:52:18,040 --> 01:52:20,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Much later that night,
you'd have to come back to the house</i></font>

2088
01:52:20,640 --> 01:52:23,280
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>to retrieve the incriminating
tampered vials.</i></font>

2089
01:52:23,360 --> 01:52:26,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>However, this time the dogs were outside.</i></font>

2090
01:52:29,120 --> 01:52:31,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>They barked, waking Meg.</i></font>

2091
01:52:31,280 --> 01:52:32,396
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>No matter.</i></font>

2092
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,312
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You'll get the vials tomorrow.</i></font>

2093
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But tomorrow brings news.</font>

2094
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:38,960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not of a medical error and a guilty nurse,</font>

2095
01:52:39,040 --> 01:52:41,191
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but of a slit throat and a suicide.</font>

2096
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:48,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Now the circumstances are perfect</i></font>

2097
01:52:48,760 --> 01:52:50,433
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>for the anonymous hirin' of me.</i></font>

2098
01:52:51,440 --> 01:52:53,636
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You know a crime has been committed
by Miss Cabrera.</i></font>

2099
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You need her to be caught for it.</i></font>

2100
01:52:55,280 --> 01:52:58,159
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You cannot reveal how you know.</font>

2101
01:52:59,960 --> 01:53:01,155
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enter...</font>

2102
01:53:01,240 --> 01:53:02,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benoit Blanc.</font>

2103
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:04,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Benny, look, I hear what you're saying,</font>

2104
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:06,036
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but this...</font>

2105
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:08,432
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The body is discovered early
the next morning.</font>

2106
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:10,910
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The police,
the medical examiner, the family,</i></font>

2107
01:53:11,320 --> 01:53:13,437
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everyone swarms in</font>

2108
01:53:13,520 --> 01:53:15,273
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there is no possible way</font>

2109
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:18,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you can get to Marta's medical bag
to retrieve the vials.</font>

2110
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:19,954
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You must wait for your moment,</font>

2111
01:53:20,040 --> 01:53:21,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the investigation is over</font>

2112
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:25,117
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you know the house will be empty.</font>

2113
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,793
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that is why</font>

2114
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:28,800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you missed the funeral.</font>

2115
01:53:30,160 --> 01:53:33,915
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>There is no one home to wonder
why you're going into Harlan's study.</i></font>

2116
01:53:35,160 --> 01:53:36,879
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Or so you think.</i></font>

2117
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Poor Fran.</i></font>

2118
01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,754
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She witnessed you tampering</i></font>

2119
01:53:42,840 --> 01:53:45,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>with Harlan's medication
in the medical bag.</i></font>

2120
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:48,477
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>She did not know what you were doing.</i></font>

2121
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:51,715
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>But she knew you were up to no good.</i></font>

2122
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,598
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>So her mind begins to turn.</i></font>

2123
01:53:53,720 --> 01:53:54,720
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Oh, God.</i></font>

2124
01:53:55,520 --> 01:53:58,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Hallmark movie she told me about
with Danica McKellar...</font>

2125
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,996
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Deadly by Surprise.</i></font>

2126
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:01,639
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what she was talking about.</font>

2127
01:54:01,720 --> 01:54:03,074
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She loved Harlan.</font>

2128
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,874
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She hates Ransom.</font>

2129
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,596
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So the poor girl decides
to test her theory,</font>

2130
01:54:07,680 --> 01:54:09,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and make this asshole pay.</font>

2131
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:12,439
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She gets a copy of the toxicology report.</font>

2132
01:54:12,520 --> 01:54:15,911
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, I will be honest, I have no idea how.</font>

2133
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:17,320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause she has a cousin.</font>

2134
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:21,551
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She told me, she has a cousin who works as
a receptionist at the examiner's office.</font>

2135
01:54:21,640 --> 01:54:22,869
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, voila!</font>

2136
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:25,913
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The numbers, they mean nothing to her,</font>

2137
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,676
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but if Ransom is guilty,
its existence is a threat,</font>

2138
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:32,679
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so she photocopies the header
and makes her blackmail note.</font>

2139
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:35,154
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why did she send it to me?</font>

2140
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,310
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She didn't.</font>

2141
01:54:37,080 --> 01:54:38,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She sent it to Ransom.</font>

2142
01:54:43,960 --> 01:54:46,156
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And when Mr. Drysdale gets it,</i></font>

2143
01:54:46,240 --> 01:54:47,640
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>what is his reaction?</i></font>

2144
01:54:48,360 --> 01:54:49,360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Elation.</font>

2145
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:53,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He still thinks Marta has given Harlan
the tampered drugs.</i></font>

2146
01:54:53,480 --> 01:54:56,120
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>A blood tox report will prove her guilt.</i></font>

2147
01:54:56,240 --> 01:54:58,471
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He goes to the will reading
in high spirits,</i></font>

2148
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:01,359
<font face="Comic Sans MS">ready to see the family tear itself apart,</font>

2149
01:55:01,440 --> 01:55:04,035
<font face="Comic Sans MS">secure in the knowledge
it will be all undone</font>

2150
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,430
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when the tox report comes to light.</font>

2151
01:55:07,640 --> 01:55:09,040
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And then...</font>

2152
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:11,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Marta's confession.</i></font>

2153
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:15,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And everything turns on its head.</i></font>

2154
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:19,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He now realizes that Marta
has committed no crime</i></font>

2155
01:55:19,480 --> 01:55:22,951
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>and the tox report
will prove her innocence.</i></font>

2156
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:25,478
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>The changed will is gonna stand.</i></font>

2157
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:27,719
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>He has lost.</i></font>

2158
01:55:29,560 --> 01:55:30,994
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Unless...</i></font>

2159
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,353
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Unless you decide...</font>

2160
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:36,672
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're not gonna give up the money.
- You're not gonna give up the money.</font>

2161
01:55:36,760 --> 01:55:39,400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You've come this far.
- You've come this far.</font>

2162
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:42,232
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just one step further,</font>

2163
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:45,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just one last act.</font>

2164
01:55:45,680 --> 01:55:47,831
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In for a penny, in for a pound.</font>

2165
01:55:50,520 --> 01:55:52,352
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You decide you are in.</font>

2166
01:55:57,360 --> 01:55:58,589
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 1...</i></font>

2167
01:55:59,920 --> 01:56:02,799
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Destroy all evidence of Marta's innocence.</i></font>

2168
01:56:09,280 --> 01:56:10,555
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 2,</i></font>

2169
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,916
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>send her the anonymous e-mail</i></font>

2170
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,469
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>with a late morning rendezvous time...</i></font>

2171
01:56:18,960 --> 01:56:21,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>And deliver her the blackmail note.</i></font>

2172
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:25,914
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Step 3,</i></font>

2173
01:56:26,480 --> 01:56:28,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>keep your appointment with Fran.</i></font>

2174
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:32,153
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, I knew it.</font>

2175
01:56:32,600 --> 01:56:34,876
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you were a no-good son of a bitch.</font>

2176
01:56:35,440 --> 01:56:37,557
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew Harlan wouldn't just kill himself.</font>

2177
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,199
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes, Fran, you were right.</font>

2178
01:56:39,560 --> 01:56:41,870
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew you were guilty as shit.</font>

2179
01:56:41,960 --> 01:56:43,917
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you're gonna pay for it!</font>

2180
01:56:44,320 --> 01:56:45,834
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you come near me.</font>

2181
01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:48,480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't come near me! I'm warning you!</font>

2182
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,071
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>See, now, now the board is set.</i></font>

2183
01:57:00,200 --> 01:57:02,192
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>Marta will get the blackmail note.</i></font>

2184
01:57:02,280 --> 01:57:04,237
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You'll put the pieces together for her.</i></font>

2185
01:57:04,320 --> 01:57:06,073
<font face="Comic Sans MS"><i>You'll guide her to the rendezvous.</i></font>

with the body and the burned evidence.</i></font>

2188
01:57:11,480 --> 01:57:14,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Marta will get arrested for killing Fran</font>

2189
01:57:14,280 --> 01:57:15,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and Harlan.</font>

2190
01:57:17,040 --> 01:57:19,157
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- She said...
- You did this.</font>

2191

<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hugh did this."</font>

2195
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:32,991

2196
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:35,635
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause you're an asshole.</font>

2197
01:57:37,120 --> 01:57:38,759
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it would have worked</font>

2198

2204
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,791

2213

2215
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:33,560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes?</font>

2216
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:38,600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Doctor, that's great news.</font>

2217
01:58:39,680 --> 01:58:41,592

2219
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:49,110
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's ready to talk.</font>

2220
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,998
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Trooper Wagner, if you could
keep Mr. Drysdale in custody</font>

01:58:53,080 --> 01:58:55,197
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while Lieutenant Elliott,
Miss Cabrera, and myself,</font>

2222
01:58:55,280 --> 01:58:57,875
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we go to the hospital
and take Fran's statement.</font>

2223
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,394
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Up, come on.</font>

2224
01:59:05,720 --> 01:59:07,200
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna say this just to you.</font>

2225
01:59:07,720 --> 01:59:10,758
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No cameras, no courtroom,
just you, 'cause you know it's true.</font>

2226
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:13,399
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We allowed you into our home.</font>

2227
01:59:13,480 --> 01:59:16,678
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We let you watch our granddad.
We welcomed you into our family.</font>

2228
01:59:16,760 --> 01:59:19,116
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now you think
you can steal it from us?</font>

2229
01:59:19,200 --> 01:59:22,398
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I'm not gonna fight
to protect my home,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">our birthright,</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what do you have on me?</font>

2238
01:59:45,480 --> 01:59:47,119
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. What, attempted murder?</font>

2239
01:59:47,240 --> 01:59:49,675
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get arson for the building

<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the shit!</font>

2244
02:00:09,720 --> 02:00:11,279
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means she's lying!</font>

2245
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:12,714
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man, we know.</font>

2246

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fran's dead.</font>

2248
02:00:20,120 --> 02:00:22,271
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you just confessed to her murder.</font>

2249
