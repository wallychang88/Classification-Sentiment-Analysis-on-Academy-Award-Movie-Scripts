1
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:07,050
As we end up here?

2
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,897
This place is horrible

3
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,971
Smells like hell

4
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,643
We do not belong to this hole fucking

5
00:02:51,305 --> 00:02:52,169
Hey Sam

6
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:54,068
Pope·... what kind of, shut up!
- Hello carió

7
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:55,774
What type of flowers you said
you wanted to?

8
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,069
Camellias, are something that smells good

9
00:02:58,278 --> 00:02:58,937
You know?

10
00:02:59,146 --> 00:03:01,478
Something that...
- All sounds like Kim Chi

11
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,980
Ok, then something that is
looks good, what is less roses

12
00:03:05,219 --> 00:03:06,413
Hate to make this work

13
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,952
Ok

14
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:30,775
Riggan all the note I for 1-4
they are ready for you

15
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:35,447
Riggan are ready for you

16
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,551
Oh hello friend, as these?

17
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,384
Well, you already know

18
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,493
I would go better if I could do
Ralph leave·

19
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,793
Act

20
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,963
Be· well

21
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,657
Screaming, I love you, I love you

22
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:27,696
Bitch

23
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,567
You do with a love like that?

24
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,169
As that is... that is not love

25
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,532
And t what you know, because you insist
calling it love?

26
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,502
You can say what you want

27
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:35,970
But I know what that was

28
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,140
That there are of you?

29
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:38,672
That sounds like love to you?

30
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:39,878
LametÛn be late

31
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:42,313
Look, I'm the person to equivocad
to whom to ask

32
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,610
I've only known this as well from last

33
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,713
Not sabrÌa

34
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,854
You need to know the details, but I think
that what you say is

35
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,583
Love is all

36
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,655
If
If

37
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:53,349
The kind of love of which I speak is

38
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,924
That guy in the you're not trying to
kill people

39
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:58,358
It was love, seriously, what was

40
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,554
I don't care what they say

41
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,464
...l was ready to die for it

42
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:03,533
Pregntale or did
after that dejÛ

43
00:05:04,438 --> 00:05:07,168
Got a shot in the mouth but
also what did he do wrong

44
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:09,568
Poor head
Poor head, my balls

45
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,539
The guy was dangerous

46
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,804
As he did so bad if they are shot
in the mouth?

47
00:05:14,014 --> 00:05:16,778
SolÌa carry a 22-gauge solÌamos live
as fugitives, then

48
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,948
Ralph, Ralph, Ralph

49
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:19,612
The fugitives are afraid

50
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,946
Est·n on the run

51
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,719
So many times we have to

52
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,118
You may give me a little m·s that?

53
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:26,785
Fear
It is a great idea

54
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:29,789
We live as fugitives
at that time

55
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,665
Never sabÌa if saldrÌa
detr·s bush

56
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,929
Or a car and you start to shoot,
the man was crazy

57
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,764
It was capable of everything

58
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:39,796
Christ, that nightmare

59
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:40,564
If

60
00:05:40,774 --> 00:05:41,832
SolÌa call me at the hospital

61
00:05:42,309 --> 00:05:43,674
And decÌa, "son of a bitch

62
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,141
Your days are numbered.“

63
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:49,543
It was too much?

64
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,712
I pass I realize because

65
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,908
I just want to give you a range

66
00:05:55,822 --> 00:05:56,811
Someone call 911

67
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,114
This breathing?

68
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:01,425
That pasÛ, where saliÛ?
To dÛnde are you going?

69
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:04,394
Someone call emergency
- Let's call the ambulance

70
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:08,325
That being· a demand
- Ok, dÛnde are you going?

71
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:10,126
We have to be ready
in 5 minutes

72
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:12,032
You will need·s to forget it
we have to cancel

73
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:14,467
But we are exhausted tendrÌamos
to reimburse all the...

74
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:16,040
Just do it
- That step?

75
00:06:16,276 --> 00:06:17,038
As the est· Ralph?

76
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,233
Be· well
- Wait, wait

77
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,411
You may expect?
- Escchame

78
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:23,047
Without exagerares the worst actor
I've seen in my life

79
00:06:23,317 --> 00:06:25,512
The blood coming out of his oÌdos is what
m·s creÌble that has been done up to now

80
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:26,947
It is not so bad

81
00:06:28,956 --> 00:06:30,355
Ok, it's terrible

82
00:06:30,624 --> 00:06:33,787
But listen t you don't have to
press in your walk-in closets

83
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:36,554
I do not know what they dirÈ
- Well, we verÈ to do

84
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:37,491
Waiting

85
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,327
That was not an accident

86
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:44,298
What do you mean?

87
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,738
I did that happen

88
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:47,833
Oh ok

89
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,397
These drunk?

90
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,441
Only encuÈntrame an actor
a good one

91
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:53,777
Kenny...?
- Willy Harris

92
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,778
Est· doing The Hunger Games

93
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,279
Michael Fassbender
- Est· doing X-Men

94
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,250
Such Jeremy Reynold?

95
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,919
Who?
- Jeremy Reynold

96
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:03,178
He was nominated

97
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,321
It is an interesting type
- This is an adventure

98
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:10,221
Crap, I have Him also?
I can't believe it

99
00:07:10,497 --> 00:07:12,021
I don't care, just find
someone

100
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,196
Ralph we sue·

101
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,800
What har· and has a case

102
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:21,538
Just make it go away

103
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:23,476
Look, you're my lawyer

104
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:25,838
You're my producer, my best friend

105
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,211
Truth? Now

106
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,012
Go and do what you were born
to make

107
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,408
I don't care cÛmo, just go

108
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,312
And as you expect it to do so?

109
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,877
That clown has neither the
half of your talent

110
00:07:58,078 --> 00:08:01,343
And you are earning a fortune in that
costume tin man

111
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,277
You are the real thing, Riggan

112
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,579
Ok...
- What we had all

113
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,055
What regalaste

114
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:16,721
You gave these fakers keys
of the kingdom

115
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,091
Breathe...
- Listen to Me?

116
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,191
Inhale and exhale

117
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,197
If

118
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,368
AcÈptalo

119
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:26,834
But you know that I do not irÈ

120
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:28,239
You know I have razÛn

121
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,837
Look at that

122
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:02,340
These people do not know what
you are able to

123
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:14,944
Because someone irÌa to be the hero
in a franchise of comics

124
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,223
Act of Raymond Carver
in the scenario

125
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:21,120
As you probably know

126
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:25,497
Barthes said that the cultural work done
in the past

127
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:27,599
By gods and demigods

128
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,429
Now it is done in the commercial
detergent

129
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,168
And people of strips of comics

130
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,934
If it is, absolutely

131
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,341
Absolutely

132
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:40,505
You know?

133
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,475
As you said

134
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:42,704
That

135
00:09:43,383 --> 00:09:44,213
Barthes said

136
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,616
Go to Birdman as Icaro

137
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,878
Ok, wait, wait

138
00:09:48,155 --> 00:09:49,247
Who is this such Barthes

139
00:09:49,456 --> 00:09:50,514
In that Birdman was?

140
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,590
Roland Barthes was a French filÛsofo

141
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,259
And if you knew something of the
story of the century...

142
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,523
Now, it is true that you've been
injecting semen of pigs bebÈs?

143
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,299
Apology?
- As a topic of facial rejuvenation?

144
00:10:03,537 --> 00:10:04,526
Where leÌste that?

145
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:05,898
He was sent to Twitter by

146
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:07,766
"Whispers of PrÛstata“

147
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,105
It is not true
- What sÈ, but what did you do?

148
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,843
Not, I did not
- Ok

149
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,171
You say that is not true
- Then don't you deny it

150
00:10:13,413 --> 00:10:14,903
Write·n that is,
why you write something?

151
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,114
I don't...

152
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:17,505
Do not write what she said

153
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:19,046
I did not do it, I haven't got

154
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:20,218
Pigs bebÈs...

155
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:23,285
These aware that the people dir·
that har·s this work

156
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:27,716
To fight against the impresiÛn that
you are an actor forgotten...

157
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:29,725
Absueltamente not, absolutely not
that is why

158
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:30,724
20 years atr·s

159
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,589
I neguÈ to make Birdman 4

160
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,092
Birdman 4?

161
00:10:36,369 --> 00:10:37,427
Har·s Birdman 4?

162
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,470
Thanks, can come in,
thank you, thank you

163
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:41,936
Wait for good works

164
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,611
The boys of advertising

165
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:50,507
Want a movie that is the
worst idea right now

166
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:56,846
That you are doing?
- I don't want to see this

167
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,723
That was a gift from the team

168
00:10:59,292 --> 00:10:59,986
Don't mess with those guys

169
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,160
Are the union
- I don't care

170
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:03,521
As I was?

171
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,992
Well

172
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,256
They talked about Ralph?

173
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:08,058
What I did, you know?
The bastard did it

174
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:10,433
To sue us even
I hope to get out of the hospital

175
00:11:10,637 --> 00:11:11,831
That you said?
- I said?

176
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:13,403
If
- I said hey bastard

177
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:14,771
I threats?

178
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,305
I swear that if I get though
whether a letter of attorney

179
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,972
The press receive· im·genes
of your computer, that I said

180
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:21,111
Im·genes?

181
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:23,209
Him like the nuns

182
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,507

That matter to you?, Not deberÌas know

00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,181
YES, it is fant·forecast

187
00:11:32,392 --> 00:11:33,324
Except one thing
- That?

188
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,549
We don't have an actor

189
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,554
And if we cancel the first preview

190
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:37,861
The press sniff· blood

191
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,292
And we can't afford to
miss m·s money

192
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:40,226
For nothing
- Ok

193
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,365

“Hey friends when I start?“

199
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:55,945
Can I speak to you a second?

200
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:56,547
If that happens?

201
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,874
Did you find another actor?

202
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:58,880

203

You think you want to do that?

Intimidating, no?

230
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:14,259
Do you have any idea of the people who have
walked in these tables

231

It is a good theater

243
00:13:40,053 --> 00:13:41,315
I can't speak for your work but

244
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:43,512
Let's do a bit of it, yes?

245
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,557
Oh, I don't expect that you commit...
- The preview is maÒana, let's work

246
00:13:48,795 --> 00:13:49,921
Ok, good

247
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,125
SiÈntete free to make the script
- No, only

248
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:55,197
Let's make something out of it

249
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,995
Well, ok

250
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,198
Hey Èchale a look at the
p·gina 20

251
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,373
I'm fine, I don't need this

252
00:14:00,607 --> 00:14:01,869
Why?
- I don't need the script

253
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,201
Just give me an entry
- What are you talking about?

254
00:14:03,777 --> 00:14:04,641
Give me a line

255
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,403
CÛmo?

00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:07,709
Ok, est· well

257
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,246
Ok

258
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,346
DÈjame think

259
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:12,418
If

260
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,251
Hey I'm the wrong person
to whom to ask

261
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:15,982
Ok? I don't conocÌa man

262
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,520
Just listen to his name, number

263
00:14:18,425 --> 00:14:19,050
Not what is

264
00:14:19,292 --> 00:14:20,884
Do not listen to the details, but
I think what you say

265
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:22,890
Is that the love all

266
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,265
That is what I'm saying? I say that
love is all?

267
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,895
Yeah, ok, yes!

268
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:30,364
The kind of love that I speak

269
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,298
It is absolute

270
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:32,630
The kind of love that I speak

271
00:14:33,606 --> 00:14:34,800
Not trying to kill people

272
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:36,434
As you know the lines?

273
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,640
It is one thing that I have, I don't know how
it is a gift

274
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:44,507
Come on, man, I've been away
of this for a month

275
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,617
Well, they're good
- These lines are...

276
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,579
Well

277
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,980
We go again
- Ok

278
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:50,586
Look, I'm the wrong person
to whom to ask

279
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:51,848
Not conocÌ the man really

280
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,559
Just listen to his name in passing but

281
00:14:54,527 --> 00:14:55,391
Not sÈ

282
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,391
I do not know the details

283
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:57,994
I think that what you say is

284
00:14:58,198 --> 00:14:59,096
Can I make a suggestion?

285
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,766
If, if, dale

286
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,796
For nothing

287
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,433
Forget that, just...
- Ok

288
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:04,999
QuÈdate with me
- If

289
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:07,403
I am the wrong person to the
which to ask, He says, but

290
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,403
What is that, which is the intenciÛn
in that?

291
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,542
Uncomfortable with the topic for that
what changes?

292
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,642
It mirrors the fault

293
00:15:12,846 --> 00:15:13,813
On the marriage and this is the thing

294
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,104
You have 4 lines

295
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:15,804
After that

296
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,175
They all say the same thing

297
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,617
I didn't even conocÌa man

298
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,848
Just listen to his name last

299
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,353
Not sÈ

300
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,681
I don't know the details

301
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:24,981
The details, I say

302
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,385
It is something that dirÌa my grandmother but

303
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:27,421
The point is

304
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,093
You don't know the type
- If

305
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,227
What we understand

306
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:31,725
Do it work with a single line

307
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,023
Even conocÌa the type

308
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:33,995
Well?
- If

309
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:36,828
Listen, you know my lines also, isn't it?

310
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,696
We can not stay hung
in-line annoying?

311
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:41,031
If, if
- We can work this

312
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,139
Do well, be

313
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,405
Then d·melo again but
cÛrtalo, intÈntalo

314
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,373
Ok

315
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,446
Hey I am not the right person to ask
- Oh, no, but that is the thing

316
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,309
You see? I am the right person to ask
then that is

317
00:15:51,518 --> 00:15:54,681
To which I say? Fuck you, go to the
shit I don't put yourself in that place

318
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:57,949
Don't make me feel consents
about my marriage

319
00:15:58,258 --> 00:16:01,227
While my wife is sitting
same here!

320
00:16:01,494 --> 00:16:02,358
If

321
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,459
I can sit?
- If, siÈntate

322
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,390
Good idea

323
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:07,362
If
- Then d·melo as vetea fuck

324
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,692
Tr·talo, we will

325
00:16:08,935 --> 00:16:09,697
If
- Only hag·moslo

326
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:11,870
Come on, d·melo cÛgeme strong

327
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,335
Come on, don't talk, just say so
you are the wrong person

328
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,476
Wow, not even conocÌa the
man, ok?

329
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:18,439
Cu·l is your point?

330
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,010
Cu·l is my point?
- If, cu·l is your point?

00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:21,611
That you say? Escpelo

That you say?

00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,349
That you say? The love
it is absolute?

334
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:26,677
If, if!

335
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,649
The kind of love that I speak

336
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:29,786
It is absolute

337
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,688
The kind of love that I speak

338
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:32,890
You don't want to

339
00:16:34,294 --> 00:16:35,693
Your not trying to kill people

340
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,290
If, well

341
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:42,826
I don't know how, what do you think boss?

342
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,729
Ok

343
00:16:45,071 --> 00:16:45,969
With me?

344
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,202
What do you think?

345
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,764
All have become

346
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,339
It is time to mate

347
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,375
TomarÈ that as a yes

348
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:57,344
Then, who are you t?

Your daughter? It is amazing

00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,319
What will you do?

For the love of God, you're going

As decÌa

501
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,418
Speaking of real love
he had a couple of elderly

502
00:23:09,488 --> 00:23:10,921
In an accident on the interstate

503
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:13,855
Some drunk guy

504
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,424
Stamp the truck of his father

505
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,690
Against the car of the couple

506
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,194
For when he arrives at the hospital

507
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,459
The guy, a fucking teenager

508
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,332
He was dead

509
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,602
So we took the couple of
elderly emergency

510
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:29,999
And we work like crazy
in them

511
00:23:30,476 --> 00:23:31,374
The greater part of the night

512
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:34,443
For when

513
00:23:35,448 --> 00:23:36,710
We ended up with them,
us only...

514
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:40,646
You know, we had pr·virtually
plastered full body

515
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:43,883
The husband

516
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:44,952
The old

517
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,321
I was depressed

518
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:50,222
For a long time even
after that I said

519
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,027
Look at your wife managed to

520
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:53,822
'an was depressed

521
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,193
Then

522
00:23:56,469 --> 00:23:59,199
I went to Him and asked

523
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,338
And I said

524
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:03,973
That was because he could not

525
00:24:04,677 --> 00:24:05,644
See it

526
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:07,336
In the eyes

527
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:08,839
It could not be to see his wife

528
00:24:10,683 --> 00:24:11,581
You may imagine

529
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,182
You say

530
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:16,179

00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:57,829
Let people

550
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,086
They are not as patÈticos

551
00:24:59,298 --> 00:25:01,459
Stop seeing the world through the
screen your cell

552
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:02,792
To have an experience of truth

553
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,129
Someone cares about the truth
apart from me?

554
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:08,430
I say the scenario is false, the pl·tano
it is fake

555
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:12,041
There is No fucking in this
cartÛn of shit

556
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:13,938
The only thing real that I see in this
scenario

557
00:25:14,447 --> 00:25:15,744
Is this chicken

558
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:17,210
So trabajarÈ with the chicken

559
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,483
It was interesting

560
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,382
Lower the telÛn

561
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,216
This good friend

562
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:28,124
S·quenlo of here

563
00:25:28,394 --> 00:25:29,383
As you want to do that?

564
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:33,992
Hey, wait

565
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,962
What I want out
- Not

566
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,030
What?, We can not do that

567
00:25:37,303 --> 00:25:38,201
Of course we can

568
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:39,301
It is our show

569
00:25:39,505 --> 00:25:40,767
Escchame
- No, your escchame

570
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:41,802
Escchame

571
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:43,507
S·calo of my fucking work

572
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,733
I'm not going to stand here

573
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:48,880
It's crazy, no matter the preview
it doesn't matter until the Times

574
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:50,309
Sitting here in the night
opening

575
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:54,384
Get rid of Him, I don't care...
- Only c·llate and escchame once

576
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:57,988
Or well, we announced that the entrarÌa,
sales doubled

577
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,179
In less than a day

578
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:02,485
We can't afford to lose m·s money
and much less to Mike

579
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:08,500
This is about respect and validate
do you remember? That you told me

580
00:26:09,435 --> 00:26:10,766
So I got involved in this shit

581
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,568
You are the director, put it in order, ok?

582
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:20,239
Fuck

583
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,203
This is no longer the years 90

584
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,578
Your closure est· down

585
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,288
Fuck

586
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:37,427
Friend

587
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,058
Your

588
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:41,195
You were very good

589
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:46,534
Hey

590
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,502
See you in the theatre in 10 minutes
- Do not think about it too much

591
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,388
What demons happens it up?

592
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:07,314
Not sabÌa that estarÌas auqui
tonight

593
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,118
That guy is a imbÈcil

594
00:27:10,863 --> 00:27:11,887
If you do here?

595
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:14,765
Sam and I go to eat something
after you finish

596
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:16,901
No, I say, here now

597
00:27:17,436 --> 00:27:18,061
Good

598
00:27:18,304 --> 00:27:19,703
SÈ cu·t does this mean for you

599
00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:21,368
Oh

600
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,333
Thanks, I appreciate it

601
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:25,605
Then that happens?

602
00:27:26,612 --> 00:27:27,601
The work? Since the dress

603
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,905
No, you and Sam

604
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:30,143
Oh

605
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,383
You know, it's great

606
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:33,846
The same

607
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:34,915
You spoke with her?

608
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:35,915
If

609
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:37,083
We speak

610
00:27:38,023 --> 00:27:39,957
You know, has been a craze here

611
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:41,158
And...

612
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,591
You understand dÛnde est· your mind?

613
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,659
If of course

614
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,857
She tries to get away from it all

615
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:48,226
And all that put in rehabilitaciÛn
in the first place

616
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,366
If
- Then, you already know

617
00:27:49,602 --> 00:27:50,432
What sÈ, seriously

618
00:27:50,703 --> 00:27:52,000
What I understand, I understand

619
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:53,569
But it is all that has taken
- If

620
00:27:53,772 --> 00:27:54,739
This confused
- What I understand

621
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:57,141
Look sÈ these gotten
in all of this

622
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,239
But you have to
- Stop?

623
00:27:59,578 --> 00:28:00,408
You know what I mean

624
00:28:02,548 --> 00:28:04,140
Riggan you don't have to be
a great father

625
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:05,042
Right now

626
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:06,306
You just have to be one

627
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:08,118
Oh, I'm sorry

628
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:12,514
As it going?

629
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:15,986
I don't want to talk about it

630
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:17,159
Shots?

631
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:19,226
I take a beer

632
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:20,763
Ok

633
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:24,495
Then

634
00:28:26,672 --> 00:28:27,502
That happens to you?

635
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,670
With me?
- If

636
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:31,838
Nothing

637
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:34,807
Everything is the same I guess

638
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,674
VolverÈ to enseÒar

639
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:39,812
Oh yeah?

640
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,081
Hey

641
00:28:41,987 --> 00:28:44,217
I am thinking of refinancing my
house in Malib

642
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:46,615
Why? Sorry?

643
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:48,450
I'm thinking of refinance
- Not

644
00:28:49,328 --> 00:28:51,057
You just needed escuchÈ
a moment

645
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:53,956
That being· Sam's house

646
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,360
Why...

647
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:57,624
For this work?

648
00:29:00,606 --> 00:29:01,504
I need the money

649
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,070
Have you any idea what
crazy that sounds like that?

650
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:09,271
What can I say? The house durÛ
m·s that the money

651
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:10,311
You already know

652
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:12,913
That happens

653
00:29:14,653 --> 00:29:17,087
Riggan mÌrame

654
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,125
I have the opportunity to make
something good

655
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,530
Should I take it

656
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,564
I have to

657
00:29:32,037 --> 00:29:34,062
That's funny I was here
esper·ndote

658
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,766
And nothing

659
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,499
It could not be recalled because
we ended up

660
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,940
You know the last time I came
here from THE

661
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:47,310
George Clooney was sitting

662
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,850
Two seats in front of my

663
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,652
Well-dressed

664
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,254
And that mentÛn speaker

665
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,859
We ended up flying for a

666
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:57,488
Horrible aerolÌnea

667
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:01,361
And He was wrong, trembling

668
00:30:02,401 --> 00:30:03,129
And

669
00:30:03,569 --> 00:30:06,470
When subiÛ on board was
crying, I say

670
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,297
Crying, praying, yes?

671
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:11,301
I alone sentÈ here

672
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,508
The crying and I sit here

673
00:30:14,413 --> 00:30:15,311
And I thought

674
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:16,406
Oh go

675
00:30:17,116 --> 00:30:18,014
The prÛxima maÒana

676
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:19,675
When Sam looks at the periÛdico

677
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,079
That name looks on the page
front?

678
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:24,387
The mÌo not

679
00:30:25,457 --> 00:30:26,287
You know?

680
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:37,962
You know that Farra Faucett muriÛ the
same day that Michael Jackson?

681
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:39,199
It's not crazy?

682
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,582
Where we ended up?

683
00:30:57,322 --> 00:30:59,153
Because I threw a knife
kitchen

684
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,352
And a time m·s late I decÌas
how much you loved me

685
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:06,563
You know just because I did not like
that ridÌcula comedy

686
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:09,063
With Goldie Hawn's not meant
that is not loved you

687
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,628
Is what you always do

688
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,872
You confuse love with admiraciÛn

689
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,706
It's your house, do what you want
with her

690
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:19,400
Just make sure to be here
for your daughter

691
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,108
What harÈ

692
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:24,649
You're not Farra Faucett, Riggan

693
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:30,080
We had to make this show a reality
they offered us

694
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:31,552
The Thompsons

695
00:31:31,824 --> 00:31:33,018
C·llate
- It would have been nice

696
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:33,714
C·llate

697
00:31:34,026 --> 00:31:35,789
A daughter crazy and addicted to drugs

698
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,756
A wife with nice tits stops

699
00:31:38,864 --> 00:31:39,990
The people would have wanted to
see that

700
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:43,026
C·llate
- Is m·s this shit

701
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:43,793
C·llate

702
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:48,830
The sun bed is here

703
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,200
What does that mean?
- Means that

704
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:51,899
There is a tanning bed it outside

705
00:31:52,111 --> 00:31:53,578
They deliver here in

706
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,402
Who ordered a tanning bed?

707
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:58,912
Mike says that is part of the development
your character

708
00:31:59,184 --> 00:32:00,151
Fuck

709
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:01,512
It is a peasant

710
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:03,145
Son of a bitch

711
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:09,753
We will

712
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:10,892
Let us walk
- To dÛnde are we going?

713
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,097
We're going to take cafÈ

714
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,163
I did something for missing the respect?

715
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,024
Not yet

716
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,235
Look, I have a lot bet
in this fucking work

717
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:18,266
Don't tell me
- If?

718
00:32:18,537 --> 00:32:19,401
People know who I am

719
00:32:19,638 --> 00:32:21,162
And...
- TonterÌas

720
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,499
Don't know

721
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,335
Or your work, you know
the type of the work of p·jaro

722
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,670
Who goes and tells stories
on Letterman

723
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,872
Sorry not to be popular
- I don't care, popular?

724
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,808
The popularity is the premium slippery
the prestige

725
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:37,449
Well, I don't know how, nor that shit
does that mean

726
00:32:38,524 --> 00:32:39,252
Take

727
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:43,358
It means that my reputaciÛn est·
at stake in this, and it is worth

728
00:32:43,629 --> 00:32:44,527
Much, is worth a lot!

729
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,924
Exact, fuck you

730
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:47,655
If, if this does not work

731
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:53,202
You return to your study and your genocide
cultural perpetrate,

732
00:32:53,405 --> 00:32:55,202
A imbÈcil is born every minute

733
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,035
That said inventÛ the circus

734
00:32:58,243 --> 00:33:02,145
And not much has changed, if they get
some shit.

735
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,108
The people har· line and pay· view

736
00:33:04,383 --> 00:33:05,611
But long after you've gone

737
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:06,841
I estarÈ in that scenario

738
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:07,949
Gan·ndome life

739
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:08,949
Loading my soul

740
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:11,155
Struggling with emotions
complex human

741
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:12,788
That harÈ
- Then

742
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:16,688
If, that is tratÛ all?
Struggles with complex emotions?

743
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:23,494
We are going is not the great thing, Riggan,
in New York we do things well

744
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:25,398
AdÛnde are you going?

745
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,369
Have coffee here

746
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:36,645
Thanks Tommy

747
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:39,811
Is reÌan in my damn face
- This night is reÌan

748
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,144
MaÒana what may·n on Twitter

749
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,614
That will be the shit,
who cares?

750
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:46,318
This is the people that pay half of
price to see us rehearse

751
00:33:46,592 --> 00:33:48,253
Stops..
- This is a drama

752
00:33:48,427 --> 00:33:49,416
Will Raymond Carver

753
00:33:49,628 --> 00:33:51,095
You don't know that it is
this work

754
00:33:51,797 --> 00:33:52,525
You don't know

755
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,663
For this reason they are the previews

756
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,924
That's why they are called previews

757
00:33:56,168 --> 00:33:58,762
Here is where you realize
what is the work

758
00:33:59,004 --> 00:33:59,629
I say

759
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:01,600
Ok, look, look

760
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:03,503
Escchame

761
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,876
You see the woman in the end
of the bar?

762
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,573
It seems that the lamio
back to a pauper?

763
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,644
If

764
00:34:10,616 --> 00:34:12,015
The only thing that matters

765
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:14,878
Is what she write· in 500 words,
it is...

766
00:34:15,153 --> 00:34:16,142
Tabitha Dickenson, if

767
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:17,777
And crÈelo or not

768
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:18,990
The only opiniÛn that matter

769
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,384
In the theatre of New York is yours

770
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:21,616
If you like us

771
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,552
We continue to

772
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:23,625
If this is not so, we're screwed

773
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:27,995
If it seems that you lamiÛ the rear
a hobo

774
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,165
Do me a favor

775
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:32,228
Don't aloques by a damn
preview

776
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:34,928
In something as well, and don't tell me
as does my work

777
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:36,071
This is my city

778
00:34:36,308 --> 00:34:37,366
And to be honest

779
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:39,235
People don't care
a shit here

780
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:41,241
You are Riggan Thomson, isn't it?

781
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:44,239
We importarÌa taken a
photo with us?

782
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:45,074
No, No
- Thanks

783
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,544
We importarÌa?

784
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:47,876
Why?
- The botÛn est· down

785
00:34:52,157 --> 00:34:53,818
Who is this guy?
- SolÌa be Birdman

786
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:57,024
Ok

787
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:58,624
Great

788
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:00,959
That handsome, thanks

789
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:01,894
It is very sweet
- Thanks

790
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:03,123
Handsome
- Thanks

791
00:35:04,803 --> 00:35:05,929
We will

792
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,874
We are already good?

793
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,044
It is time to go home

794
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,375
Well, I see you maÒana

795
00:35:22,521 --> 00:35:23,579
I want to know something

796
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,446
Why Raymond Carver?

797
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:32,793
Had a guy

798
00:35:33,498 --> 00:35:34,522
In the secondary

799
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:35,961
During a work

800
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:37,197
I was in the audience

801
00:35:38,337 --> 00:35:39,326
And the

802
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:40,300
EnviÛ this back

803
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:41,771
After

804
00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,539
Thanks for a good presentaciÛn

805
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:48,111
Ray Carver
- If

806
00:35:49,948 --> 00:35:50,915
If?

807
00:35:51,183 --> 00:35:53,674
So it's like I knew that it would be
an actor

808
00:35:54,419 --> 00:35:55,249
Same here

809
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,522
That is so funny?

810
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:04,059
Nothing, it is just a cocktail napkin
- Yes, and?

811
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,592
I was drunk

812
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,436
You're going to Hollywood, Mike?

813
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:13,634
Not

814
00:36:15,607 --> 00:36:17,268
No, Hollywood comes here, Tabi

815
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,032
Good luck with that

816
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,442
A man becomes
a critical

817
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,279
When you can't be an artist

818
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,278
In the same way that a man
it becomes an informant

819
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:27,577
When you can't be a soldier

820
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,913
Flaubert, no?

821
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:33,182
Is a clown of Hollywood
in a suit, expensive

822
00:36:34,092 --> 00:36:34,922
If, what is

823
00:36:35,594 --> 00:36:37,255
But maÒana after 8

824
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:39,293
Pay off· on that stage
to risk everything

825
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:41,988
That har·s t?

826
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:46,201
You're not concerned that you of a
bad criticism

827
00:36:47,439 --> 00:36:48,201
Insurance har·s

828
00:36:49,174 --> 00:36:50,903
If I give you a bad presentaciÛn

829
00:36:52,844 --> 00:36:53,811
Ms. Dickenson

830
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,446
Mr. Seiner

831
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,380
Hey
- Hey

832
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,084
Do you even here?

833
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:13,120
Nothing

834
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,291
Your costumes est·n the dressing room

835
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,592
Great

836
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,161
Great
- ConseguÌ coconut water that querÌas

837
00:38:20,398 --> 00:38:23,060
If you want to do another thing... why?

838
00:38:25,337 --> 00:38:26,429
I'm not sure

839
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:27,694
I said thanks

840
00:38:28,607 --> 00:38:30,234
Why?
- For all

841
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:31,806
I mean, you've been doing for a
good job

842
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:32,839
And you already know

843
00:38:33,078 --> 00:38:33,703
Honestly

844
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,469
I've been so worried

845
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,738
With all...
- If

846
00:38:38,917 --> 00:38:39,713
Ok, good

847
00:38:41,186 --> 00:38:42,084
Only querÌa say that

848
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:47,755
Why is that?

849
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:49,790
That smell

850
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:51,655
What is it?

851
00:38:51,897 --> 00:38:52,659
MÌrame

852
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:53,693
MÌrame!
- That?

853
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:54,556
Why?

854
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,028
Come on, you must be kidding

855
00:38:56,301 --> 00:38:57,325
Pap·
- Where is?

856
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:00,332
We can not do this please?.

857
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:02,368
Pap·

858
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:03,402
DÛnde est·?

859
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:04,672
I can't believe it

860
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,207
Why is this?

861
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:10,945
Butter manÌ

862
00:39:12,284 --> 00:39:13,114
This, this

863
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,147
Why is this?

864
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:16,716
Is marijuana

865
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,151
Rel·feast

866
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:18,879
Rel·feast?

867
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,057
You may not like this to me

868
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,452
To you?
- C·llate, you know what I'm talking about

869
00:39:22,727 --> 00:39:23,955
If you talk about it

870
00:39:24,162 --> 00:39:25,356
No, don't do that thing

871
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:26,758
Don't think in my

872
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,829
I try to do something that is
important

873
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:29,898
This is not important

874
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:30,795
It is important for my

875
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,231
Ok?

876
00:39:32,437 --> 00:39:34,268
DÈjalo to your friends cÌnicos

877
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:35,870
Whose only ambitions

878
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:37,132
It is to be viral but

879
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,137
For my

880
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,206
This is

881
00:39:39,411 --> 00:39:40,400
God mÌo, this is my career

882
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,481
It is my opportunity to do something
that really amount

883
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:45,615
Will amount to who?

884
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:47,980
You had a career, pap·

885
00:39:48,186 --> 00:39:49,585
Before the third movie of the comic

886
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:52,750
The people empezÛ to forget who I was
in this disguise of p·jaro

887
00:39:53,525 --> 00:39:55,254
Do a work-based
in a book

888
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,893
Writing for the past 60 years

889
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,195
For people old white and rich

890
00:39:59,464 --> 00:40:02,797
Whose only concern is to take
coffee and eat cake at the end

891
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,868
Nobody gives a fuck
m·s that you

892
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,869
And enfrentÈmoslo, pap·

893
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,834
You do not do this for art

894
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:12,668
You do this because you want to feel
relevant again

895
00:40:12,944 --> 00:40:13,808
Good guess

896
00:40:14,045 --> 00:40:17,503
There's a world of it outside where people
fight to be relevant to daily

897
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,248
And your acts as if there were no

898
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,185
Things happen in a place
your ignaros

899
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:25,821
A place that apparently no
you have forgotten it

900
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,820
I mean, who the fuck are you t?

901
00:40:28,727 --> 00:40:29,591
You hate bloggers

902
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,828
Teasing Twitter

903
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,324
You don't even have a
p·gina Facebook

904
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:34,222
You are the one that does not exist

905
00:40:35,033 --> 00:40:35,863
You do this

906
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:37,159
Because these terrified to death

907
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:38,198
Like the rest of us

908
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:39,527
No matter

909
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:40,396
And you know what?

910
00:40:40,672 --> 00:40:41,195
You have razÛn

911
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,406
No matter

912
00:40:42,641 --> 00:40:44,233
It is not important, ok?

913
00:40:44,476 --> 00:40:45,443
T you are not important

914
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,540
Acostmbrate

915
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:06,960
Pap·

916
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:52,732
Lesley

917
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,905
Why?
- I think that I'm hard

918
00:42:55,607 --> 00:42:58,838
It is not so, just that sometimes not
consider the feelings of the dem·s

919
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:01,840
No, No, I'm getting
hard, feels like this

920
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:04,315
Are you kidding?

921
00:43:04,516 --> 00:43:05,710
Hag·moslo real, let's take

922
00:43:05,984 --> 00:43:06,916
Est·s crazy?

923
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,710
Be· real, very real

924
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:09,945
SuÈltame Mike

925
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:12,213
Let Mike

926
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:13,722
Ll·mame Mel, Mel

927
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:15,089
B·feast

928
00:43:21,766 --> 00:43:22,425
SuÈltame

929
00:43:24,869 --> 00:43:25,767
Ed
- Why?

930
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,095
You do here?

931
00:43:27,338 --> 00:43:28,498
I just need you to tell me because

932
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,674
TÛmalo with calm,
c·lmate, sÈ that is hard

933
00:43:30,909 --> 00:43:34,242
C·llate

934
00:43:34,512 --> 00:43:35,376
Do not do anything estpido

935
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:37,877
Eddie please

936
00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:40,378
I have wrong?

937
00:43:41,085 --> 00:43:43,144
Why people don't love me?"

938
00:43:44,088 --> 00:43:45,555
Eddie, please give me the gun

939
00:43:46,724 --> 00:43:47,486
MÌrame

940
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,055
He was drowned·ndome only am I not
to be able to...

941
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:55,296
You deserved to be loved, Eddie

942
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:56,631
Seriously

943
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:58,427
Only querÌa be that t querÌas

944
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:01,697
Now I spend every minute praying
for being someone else

945
00:44:01,906 --> 00:44:02,804
Someone who I am not

946
00:44:03,942 --> 00:44:04,636
Who is
- Ok

947
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:06,571
Just put down the gun.

948
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:08,039
Ed, it's only because he doesn't love you

949
00:44:09,681 --> 00:44:10,648
You love Me, right?

950
00:44:11,282 --> 00:44:12,112
Not

951
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:15,377
And never har·s?

952
00:44:15,954 --> 00:44:16,921
Sorry

953
00:44:19,891 --> 00:44:20,880
I do not exist

954
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:24,726
I'm not even here

955
00:44:26,898 --> 00:44:27,887
None of this even matters

956
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:30,700
I don't exist

957
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,001
Ed?
- I don't exist even

958
00:44:34,906 --> 00:44:35,702
Ed!

959
00:44:35,907 --> 00:44:36,874
Don't do that

960
00:44:47,085 --> 00:44:48,177
You are a imbÈcil

961
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,278
Are you kidding? It was the best
sex scene

962
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:53,919
Fuck

963
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:55,719
It is as if my head were
baÒada of boloÒesa

964
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:56,859
Give me the blood Rig

965
00:44:57,161 --> 00:44:57,923
I arreglarÈ

966
00:44:58,129 --> 00:44:59,892
Est·we were in a hotel
- You must be kidding

967
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:03,327
You can't stop it in 6 months and now
you want to fuck me in front of 800 people?

968
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:04,865
I needed to feel it real

969
00:45:05,136 --> 00:45:05,795
Ok?

970
00:45:06,004 --> 00:45:07,266
I need that intensity
you know that on my

971
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:08,200
Fuck you
- From the beginning

972
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,703
I was sintiÈndome only pensÈ
t also

973
00:45:16,047 --> 00:45:17,981
That's never stopped you before

974
00:45:19,284 --> 00:45:20,649
Brilliant, brilliant

975
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,319
What the fuck is wrong with you?

976
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,040
I want your shit outside of the department

977
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:45,871
Why? No, wait, look

978
00:45:46,144 --> 00:45:47,133
Look at what I feel

979
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,645
Sorry, we can...?
- No, we can not Mike

980
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,973
Maybe here above are the
Mr. Truth

981
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,810
But in the real world where yes you matter
you are a fucking fraud

982
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:56,980
Such that truth, imbÈcil?

983
00:46:00,558 --> 00:46:01,490
It is a imbÈcil
- Who made it that far?

984
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:04,093
Nothing, he wanted to fuck me in front of
the whole audience

985
00:46:04,295 --> 00:46:04,920
God mÌo

986
00:46:05,196 --> 00:46:06,220
Truth?
- It is sexy

987
00:46:12,704 --> 00:46:14,865
Why I have no self-respect?

988
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:16,932
You're an actress, cariÒo

989
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:18,807
I am patÈtica

990
00:46:22,013 --> 00:46:22,707
Look

991
00:46:27,485 --> 00:46:28,213
You know what?

992
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:31,519
I've always soÒado to be
an actress of Broadway

993
00:46:32,824 --> 00:46:33,722
Since I was a pequeÒa and

994
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:34,687
Now I'm here

995
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:35,887
And I

996
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,752
I am not an actress of Broadway

997
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,997
I'm still a niÒa

998
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:46,626
I've been waiting for someone I
say that I have attained

999
00:46:47,405 --> 00:46:48,235
Hey

1000
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:49,837
What you have achieved

1001
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,802
What did I do?

1002
00:46:54,879 --> 00:46:58,178
Unfortunately it was with Mike in
a fake hotel with a lot of people...

1003
00:46:58,383 --> 00:46:59,315
C·llate

1004
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:04,884
Oh God

1005
00:47:05,156 --> 00:47:06,123
Hey, est· well?

1006
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,313
She be· well

1007
00:47:10,395 --> 00:47:11,191
Look

1008
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:12,991
None of this is your fault, ok?

1009
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,027
Ok, look at

1010
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:15,858
You're beautiful

1011
00:47:16,434 --> 00:47:17,628
You are talented

1012
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,069
And I'm lucky to have you

1013
00:47:21,773 --> 00:47:22,637
Ok?

1014
00:47:23,374 --> 00:47:26,901
Ok

1015
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,046
That was something that was sweet

1016
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:38,953
If

1017
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:42,457
What happens?

1018
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:44,623
Nothing

1019
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:47,226
2 years and He has never let me
said anything like that to my

1020
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:50,361
Hey

1021
00:47:52,437 --> 00:47:53,233
You're beautiful

1022
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:54,902
And you are talented

1023
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:56,664
And I'm lucky to have you

1024
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,335
Ok?
- What disgust

1025
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:13,720
That you are doing?

1026
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:14,821
Nothing

1027
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:25,194
Do it again

1028
00:48:33,377 --> 00:48:35,402
We can talk about this like two
artists adults?

1029
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,580
I say, which is really the
big problem...

1030
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:38,804
L·rgate

1031
00:48:42,053 --> 00:48:43,145
You are not ready then

1032
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:45,282
Est· well

1033
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:53,259
Actresses

1034
00:48:54,365 --> 00:48:55,354
Fuck

1035
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,860
Riggan

1036
00:49:00,638 --> 00:49:01,366
Your weapon

1037
00:49:01,639 --> 00:49:02,469
It is ridÌcula

1038
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:04,799
I see the red cartridge in the
caÒÛn

1039
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:07,034
So you see yourself as a niÒo with
a toy pl·forecast

1040
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,438
When pointing to my

1041
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:10,341
I don't feel threatened

1042
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:11,604
For nothing

1043
00:49:12,884 --> 00:49:14,579
Get a better,
please self-respect

1044
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:15,546
Please

1045
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:22,154
Apart from that, I think it was
a hearing very fun

1046
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,607
I don't think that is enough
high

1047
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:49,518
I didn't

1048
00:49:51,756 --> 00:49:52,552
You do up here?

1049
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:55,421
Adrenaline?

1050
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:57,757
I just got out of rehabilitaciÛn

1051
00:49:58,629 --> 00:50:00,062
It is the nearest that I get
to a drug

1052
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:02,229
Went to rehabilitaciÛn?

1053
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,594
If

1054
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,332
Great

1055
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,735
It was not a big deal or anything but

1056
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:10,838
That guy from American Pie
was it

1057
00:50:11,142 --> 00:50:11,801
If?

1058
00:50:12,677 --> 00:50:13,735
CÛmeme

1059
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:18,872
I love this city

1060
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:20,947
If

1061
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:25,719
Because acts as a imbÈcil
all the time?

1062
00:50:27,225 --> 00:50:28,852
What do you do to antagonize
to the people?

1063
00:50:30,828 --> 00:50:31,624
Maybe

1064
00:50:32,597 --> 00:50:34,758
In reality you don't care a shit
if you fall well to the people or not?

1065
00:50:36,634 --> 00:50:37,566
Not really

1066
00:50:39,303 --> 00:50:40,270
That's great

1067
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:41,863
What is it?

1068
00:50:42,073 --> 00:50:43,233
I don't sÈ

1069
00:50:44,642 --> 00:50:45,370
Hey

1070
00:50:46,577 --> 00:50:47,635
Hey
- That?

1071
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:49,671
Let's play something

1072
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:50,574
A game?

1073
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:52,079
You have 8?

1074
00:50:52,316 --> 00:50:53,340
And t 78?

1075
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:55,946
Truth or consequence
- Oh, come on

1076
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:57,381
Not
-Truth or consequence

1077
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,186
Truth

1078
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:04,789
When we met for the
the first time

1079
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:06,654
You made a comment about
my rear

1080
00:51:08,366 --> 00:51:09,230
Why did you do it?

1081
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,636
You have a great rear

1082
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,137
And I realized

1083
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,434
And only comentÈ about the

1084
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,877
Truth or consequence?

1085
00:51:21,145 --> 00:51:22,043
Result

1086
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:23,371
Seriously?
- If

1087
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:28,443
Ok

1088
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:32,348
There is a bald passing below
and I want you to escupas

1089
00:51:32,623 --> 00:51:33,419
Not

1090
00:51:33,624 --> 00:51:34,249
Said result

1091
00:51:34,525 --> 00:51:35,287
Truth

1092
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:36,221
No, it is too late

1093
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:45,533
Happy?

1094
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:46,327
If

1095
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:51,072
Truth or consequence?

1096
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:52,273
Truth

1097
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:53,601
You are boring

1098
00:51:53,878 --> 00:51:55,345
The truth is always
interesting

1099
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:01,680
You want to mess with me?

1100
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,184
Not

1101
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,387
Seriously?

1102
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:08,690
Why not?

1103
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:09,951
This is a second question

1104
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,558
It is the second part

1105
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,463
I am afraid that I could
stop

1106
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,496
That's not pareciÛ be a problem
for you on the stage

1107
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:29,144
That is because nothing is a problem
for me on the stage

1108
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:32,976
I want to ask you another question

1109
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:34,615
You've done

1110
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:35,478
A more

1111
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:36,345
Forward

1112
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:39,556
But you had fear

1113
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:42,350
That you would love me?

1114
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:50,031
You sacarÌa the eyes of the head

1115
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:52,658
That is sweet

1116
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:54,097
The pondrÌa in my own cr·neo

1117
00:52:55,506 --> 00:52:57,030
And mirarÌa for it to be able to

1118
00:52:57,308 --> 00:52:59,333
See the street, the way in which the
to when I had your age

1119
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:14,524
Good night

1120
00:54:07,411 --> 00:54:08,378
Do not kill the messenger

1121
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:11,612
It is a imbÈcil

1122
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:15,083
I told you so

1123
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:16,310
Your fucking

1124
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:17,913
Est· playing with you, Riggan

1125
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:19,389
What is?

1126
00:54:21,325 --> 00:54:22,553
P·gina 12, p·gina 12

1127
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:31,725
Where is the rest?

1128
00:54:31,936 --> 00:54:32,766
There is No rest

1129
00:54:34,171 --> 00:54:36,833
Don't worry someone will use· for
pick up dog shit maÒana

1130
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:38,406
How can you be so calm

1131
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:39,837
Another opciÛn I have?

1132
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,737
Have No fear for nothing?

1133
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:42,469
About what?

1134
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,238
On being humiliated it out

1135
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:46,347
Not would be the first time

1136
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,211
Of course not

1137
00:54:52,590 --> 00:54:53,420
You are a imbÈcil

1138
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,860
By the way, I'm not pregnant so
you should not worry about that

1139
00:55:08,572 --> 00:55:09,869
OlvÌdate of it

1140
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,539
Is robÛ your front page

1141
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,268
It robs you of your show

1142
00:55:14,512 --> 00:55:15,979
It says that you are a joke

1143
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:19,516
Now 2 million people est·n
according to Him

1144
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,409
Maybe if you were, Riggan

1145
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:22,879
Perhaps that is what you are

1146
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:24,984
A joke

1147
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:46,673
What demons happens?

1148
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:49,542
That hurts
- Lev·sit

1149
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:51,747
Receding
- So by Carver you are an actor?

1150
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:52,980
Why?
- Escchame

1151
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,150
This is my fucking show

1152
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,983
I did the work, recaudÈ the money

1153
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,278
I brought the whore press

1154
00:55:58,255 --> 00:55:59,620
Oh, Jess

1155
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:02,450
They called me to me by
an interview

1156
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,288
I told them the first thing that
I ocurriÛ

1157
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:06,155
Seriously?

1158
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:07,625
The secciÛn of the art culture

1159
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:09,822
Come on, fuck the secciÛn
art

1160
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,499
Tell them the first thing that
you ocurriÛ

1161
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:12,827
Truth, because that's you Mike

1162
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:13,401
Not?

1163
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:16,937
You are a natural kind, to those who do not
care about anything, no?

1164
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,139
That is the truth of the moment

1165
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,639
Do you think that matters?
- C·llate the fucking mouth

1166
00:56:20,878 --> 00:56:22,243
Not har·s nothing in my scenario
unless I say so

1167
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:24,202
Your scenario?

1168
00:56:24,415 --> 00:56:25,848
Oh, dÈjame to tell you something

1169
00:56:26,083 --> 00:56:28,574
This scenario has belonged to
many good actors

1170
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:29,876
But t you're not one of them
- Seriously?

1171
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:31,781
So measure your length, ok?

1172
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:35,855
Did a few changes and divagaste
some things

1173
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,189
But even so come to me

1174
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:39,760
No one cares
piece of shit

1175
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:40,487
Anyone?
- If

1176
00:56:40,798 --> 00:56:43,358
My erecciÛn had 58 thousand views

1177
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:46,764
I bet that a dildo obtendrÌa
m·s that l·rgate of here

1178
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:48,495
I don't care
- If, mind you

1179
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:53,233
You mostrarÈ, oh Mike you are
so honest

1180
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:54,442
So true, listen to

1181
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:58,980
Escchame, you said that your father was a
drunk as Carver, is it true?

1182
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,273
Is it true?
- Not

1183
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:01,643
Not
- Because my father if

1184
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,776
My father is a drunk bastard

1185
00:57:04,822 --> 00:57:05,618
You understand?
- Ok

1186
00:57:05,823 --> 00:57:06,881
Stuck us

1187
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:11,049
Est· well because while stuck us
at least I didn't think

1188
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:12,995
Take us to the tool shed

1189
00:57:13,998 --> 00:57:15,863
Because in that shed...

1190
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:17,795
You have No idea

1191
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:20,336
These are things that I don't even want to mention

1192
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:22,334
You want to tell?

1193
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:25,068
I ganÈ a name
for me same

1194
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,306
But... my poor sister

1195
00:57:30,047 --> 00:57:30,911
Ok, ok

1196
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:31,842
Ok, hey

1197
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:32,875
Hey, hey

1198
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:34,115
Hey

1199
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:35,210
God

1200
00:57:36,754 --> 00:57:37,743
I didn't know

1201
00:57:38,222 --> 00:57:38,916
Sorry

1202
00:57:39,123 --> 00:57:41,216
Sorry, that's horrible

1203
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:42,784
Sorry
- If

1204
00:57:44,862 --> 00:57:45,886
Nor is it true

1205
00:57:46,597 --> 00:57:47,586
You can see I also can't pretend

1206
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,397
Don't mess with me, Mike

1207
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,862
You say
- These a little crazy

1208
00:57:51,068 --> 00:57:53,002
DeberÌas start using that
in the scenario

1209
00:57:56,774 --> 00:57:57,798
Maybe I said that, but

1210
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:58,667
If, perhaps

1211
00:57:58,876 --> 00:57:59,433
We will

1212
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:00,609
We will
- If?

1213
00:58:00,878 --> 00:58:01,503
If

1214
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:04,010
Why don't you go by your wings and
your estpido suit bird?

1215
00:58:20,898 --> 00:58:21,728
That look, that har·n?

1216
00:58:22,232 --> 00:58:23,221
I replace?

1217
00:58:23,434 --> 00:58:25,800
You think you're a fucking Ryan Gosling
or something as well?

1218
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:51,928
You are patÈtico, Riggan

1219
00:58:52,896 --> 00:58:56,332
Pass·ndote with that faggot
theatre

1220
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,263
And 700 people sitting
they see it as well

1221
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:08,234
Now if you've goofed

1222
00:59:09,313 --> 00:59:14,945
You destroyed a good book with that child
adaptaciÛn now you're going to destroy

1223
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:16,617
What is left of your career

1224
00:59:18,856 --> 00:59:19,880
It is patÈtico

1225
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:23,749
LarguÈmonos of here
while we can

1226
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:28,721
This is not true, it is a
mental problem

1227
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:29,694
Enough with that shit

1228
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,834
It is not a mental problem

1229
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,501
I am you, imbÈcil

1230
00:59:35,139 --> 00:59:35,935
DÈjame in peace

1231
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,869
You were a movie star, remember?

1232
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:40,141
Happy

1233
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:41,606
I was not happy
- Ignorant

1234
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:43,278
But charming, now

1235
00:59:43,514 --> 00:59:45,607
You are a sucks cocks insignificant

1236
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,145
Damn miserable

1237
00:59:47,351 --> 00:59:48,648
Always miserable
- If

1238
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,547
Always miserable in Hollywood

1239
00:59:52,623 --> 00:59:53,715
You're trying to deprive?.

1240
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:54,788
That you're an artist?

1241
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:57,226
Because you're not
- Fuck you!

1242
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:58,628
No, t vetea fuck

1243
00:59:58,929 --> 00:59:59,759
Coward

1244
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,998
Missed billion

1245
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,826
Gives you hesitating to that?

1246
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:08,093
Always lose billions, and that
that makes it good?

1247
01:00:10,674 --> 01:00:11,663
I do not know if you've noticed

1248
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,536
But that was in the 1992

1249
01:00:13,744 --> 01:00:16,212
You may get yourself in that outfit
if you would like to

1250
01:00:16,413 --> 01:00:17,437
We're not dead
- MÌrame

1251
01:00:19,183 --> 01:00:20,343
Look

1252
01:00:21,051 --> 01:00:22,780
I look like a turkey

1253
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:25,418
I'm disappearing

1254
01:00:27,057 --> 01:00:27,887
You can't

1255
01:00:28,158 --> 01:00:31,025
It's like a game of Trivia Pursuit here

1256
01:00:31,195 --> 01:00:32,753
You're not an imposter

1257
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:35,158
You are a watcher, you know

1258
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:38,391
I told you already, you are dead,
please

1259
01:00:38,602 --> 01:00:39,534
We're not dead

1260
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,031
Please only quÈdate dead

1261
01:00:41,738 --> 01:00:44,104
We're not dead
- Stops shall speak unto thee plural

1262
01:00:44,341 --> 01:00:45,239
There is No us

1263
01:00:45,509 --> 01:00:46,999
I'm not your

1264
01:00:47,277 --> 01:00:50,041
BorrarÈ your whore consciousness

1265
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,009
Not

1266
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:52,305
You're Birdman

1267
01:00:53,183 --> 01:00:54,309
Because without my

1268
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,116
All that's left is you

1269
01:00:57,821 --> 01:01:00,517
The sad, egoÌsta and mediocre actor

1270
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:03,988
That clings to the last
pieces of his career

1271
01:01:10,567 --> 01:01:11,659
Why demons did you do that?

1272
01:01:12,336 --> 01:01:13,633
I liked that poster

1273
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,072
Always be· “we“, brother

1274
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:18,241
Fuck you

1275
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:21,968
DÈjame in peace

1276
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:42,992
Hey, what happens?

1277
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,357
Good

1278
01:01:45,569 --> 01:01:46,501
One hour until the telÛn

1279
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,532
Yes, great

1280
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,738
The money already llegÛ I just need to
transfer it to the account

1281
01:01:59,016 --> 01:01:59,778
Here you have, thanks
- Well

1282
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:01,080
It's great
- Then...

1283
01:02:01,752 --> 01:02:02,616
If, irÈ

1284
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:03,648
HarÈ that
- Thanks for coming

1285
01:02:04,354 --> 01:02:05,343
If
- Ok

1286
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,752
You know that I'm proud of you, no?

1287
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:14,222
This tomÛ balls

1288
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:16,092
Not est·s dead, ok

1289
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,094
What sÈ

1290
01:02:18,468 --> 01:02:19,833
I think that we should cancel
the preview

1291
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:21,462
Why?

1292
01:02:21,705 --> 01:02:22,672
I'm tired, friend

1293
01:02:23,674 --> 01:02:24,663
Since I can not do this

1294
01:02:26,376 --> 01:02:27,172
I can not

1295
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:31,339
Are you kidding

1296
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:33,479
You know?

1297
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:35,150
I do not believe this to be· for my

1298
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:38,953
Is rÌen of my

1299
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:43,991
There is a block of three rows of
people esper·ndote

1300
01:02:45,562 --> 01:02:47,826
It is a full house, we are
exhausted

1301
01:02:49,299 --> 01:02:50,425
Seriously?
- If

1302
01:02:51,468 --> 01:02:52,799
And the French ambassador comes

1303
01:02:53,537 --> 01:02:55,903
And prÌncipe of saudi arabia to bring·
one of their wives

1304
01:02:56,740 --> 01:02:58,173
And not querÌa tell you this, but

1305
01:02:58,642 --> 01:02:59,836
Martin Scorsese

1306
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:02,404
Est· organizing the distribution
of his new movie

1307
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:03,441
And you already know

1308
01:03:03,647 --> 01:03:04,705
Don't say anything

1309
01:03:05,682 --> 01:03:07,980
Ok?

1310
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:09,112
Ok, if

1311
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:10,785
If I can do it

1312
01:03:11,021 --> 01:03:11,817
I can do it

1313
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:12,851
Well
- Thanks

1314
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:18,720
CÛmo est·?

1315
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,059
Be· well

1316
01:03:22,399 --> 01:03:23,263
Poor creature

1317
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:23,956
Is it true?

1318
01:03:24,167 --> 01:03:24,826
Scorsese?

1319
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:25,898
If

1320
01:03:26,837 --> 01:03:27,769
And I was appointed as the new
Pope also

1321
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:30,701
You are a imbÈcil, Jake

1322
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:33,469
I am the only one who keeps
this afloat

1323
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:49,754
Hey

1324
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:54,761
Est·s well?

1325
01:03:55,032 --> 01:03:56,329
If

1326
01:03:56,533 --> 01:03:58,330
I think I cut the hand
afeit·ndome

1327
01:03:59,703 --> 01:04:01,170
Well, I only say querÌa

1328
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:02,667
Sorry

1329
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:03,868
Why?

1330
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,069
Good

1331
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:07,106
SÈ of what he was capable of Mike and

1332
01:04:08,478 --> 01:04:09,445
I brought him anyway

1333
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:10,340
No, No

1334
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:11,445
You did well, you did well

1335
01:04:11,715 --> 01:04:12,477
Are you kidding?

1336
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,205
You did well

1337
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:16,486
MaÒana is my

1338
01:04:16,753 --> 01:04:18,653
First night of opening
on Broadway

1339
01:04:19,322 --> 01:04:20,118
The mÌa also

1340
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:24,023
I just want you to know that without
matter what happens

1341
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,124
That

1342
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,354
I am very grateful to you

1343
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:29,589
No, No, I also

1344
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:32,426
Hey, this is exciting

1345
01:04:34,137 --> 01:04:35,468
Adem·s we have a full house

1346
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:37,031
Jake I just say

1347
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:40,233
YES, it's great

1348
01:05:15,712 --> 01:05:17,475
For the mother fucking,
jumps from one time

1349
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:20,674
As you know that estarÌa here
up?

1350
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,715
Well not sabÌa but

1351
01:05:24,621 --> 01:05:25,588
I hoped that maybe what you were

1352
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,047
Where is Lesley?

1353
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:30,992
Lesley

1354
01:05:31,828 --> 01:05:32,817
Lesley est· moving forward

1355
01:05:34,631 --> 01:05:35,757
Smart girl

1356
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:38,230
Oh, thank you, I appreciate it

1357
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:39,060
It is important to

1358
01:05:41,505 --> 01:05:43,063
Ready for your final preview

1359
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,339
Of course, if

1360
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:46,371
Who did you that?

1361
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:50,808
It could have been anyone I guess

1362
01:05:51,815 --> 01:05:52,474
If

1363
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:55,351
I'm sorry if molestÈ Lesley

1364
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:57,642
Well it was not Lesley

1365
01:06:01,992 --> 01:06:02,924
God mÌo

1366
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,889
Are you kidding?
- Not

1367
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:08,729
Jesus christ

1368
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:09,660
No, I...

1369
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,062
The...
- I think that I maybe...

1370
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:17,332
Hey

1371
01:06:18,008 --> 01:06:18,702
Fuck

1372
01:06:20,377 --> 01:06:21,401
Tell me something

1373
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:24,473
That is the worst thing that He has
fact

1374
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:26,913
Seriously

1375
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:28,116
...l was never near

1376
01:06:29,486 --> 01:06:30,248
If

1377
01:06:31,188 --> 01:06:32,587
I say, and why?
That was all?

1378
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:34,479
No, it was

1379
01:06:35,625 --> 01:06:37,217
As intentÛ reward

1380
01:06:37,527 --> 01:06:39,620
Trying to convince me
constantly

1381
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:40,761
That was special

1382
01:06:47,704 --> 01:06:50,366
Ok

1383
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:51,734
Look

1384
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:53,204
MÌrame

1385
01:06:54,778 --> 01:06:55,710
...l had razÛn however

1386
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:57,675
About what?

1387
01:06:57,914 --> 01:07:00,405
On that you are special

1388
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:02,280
You know

1389
01:07:02,552 --> 01:07:03,610
You've been by here

1390
01:07:04,321 --> 01:07:08,621
Trying to be invisible with that routine
of unsuccessful

1391
01:07:09,092 --> 01:07:10,024
But I could not

1392
01:07:10,961 --> 01:07:12,826
You are anything but invisible,
you are great

1393
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:16,196
You are a great disaster

1394
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,493
It is like a candle burning
at both ends

1395
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:19,733
But it is beautiful

1396
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:24,405
No amount of alcohol
or bad attitude, what to hide·

1397
01:07:31,081 --> 01:07:34,312
I'm happy to be a actor
and not a writer because that was

1398
01:07:34,918 --> 01:07:35,885
As

1399
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:37,751
Oprah

1400
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:40,645
Hallmark

1401
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:43,287
R. Kelly, so wrong

1402
01:07:43,493 --> 01:07:44,653
I don't querÌa...

1403
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:09,247
Truth or consequence?

1404
01:08:10,086 --> 01:08:10,848
Truth

1405
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:11,781
Not

1406
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:17,624
Truth

1407
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:18,820
Not

1408
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:22,854
Truth or consequence?

1409
01:08:45,522 --> 01:08:46,546
Have you any idea adÛnde are you going?

1410
01:08:47,324 --> 01:08:48,416
Absolutely not

1411
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,196
As you do?

1412
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:03,768
To do what?
- As sales it all night

1413
01:09:04,007 --> 01:09:05,235
And you pretend to be someone else

1414
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:06,372
In front of the whole
such people?

1415
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,968
Not I like to pretend it outside
I told you already

1416
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,411
I feign in almost all places
but not here

1417
01:09:15,385 --> 01:09:16,249
What is worth

1418
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:19,382
We do here?

1419
01:09:21,091 --> 01:09:21,853
What do you mean?

1420
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:24,918
I say, what do we do here?

1421
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:54,481
The blood should be fine
- Ok

1422
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:55,616
Prep·rate to leave in a minute
- Takes

1423
01:10:56,986 --> 01:10:58,510
That was amazing

1424
01:10:59,122 --> 01:10:59,850
Well, the truth?
- If

1425
01:11:03,693 --> 01:11:04,660
To tell the truth goes well

1426
01:11:05,328 --> 01:11:05,953
If

1427
01:11:08,064 --> 01:11:09,053
Hey

1428
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:10,931
I think we need to talk

1429
01:11:11,468 --> 01:11:12,366
No, No

1430
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,258
YES, I think you have razÛn

1431
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:19,033
But I mention it because it's the chance
to tell you that I'm sorry

1432
01:11:20,210 --> 01:11:21,268
I'm really sorry

1433
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:24,578
We were able to be good parents

1434
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:25,775
Horrible

1435
01:11:26,382 --> 01:11:28,441
Terrible hubiÈramos raised...
- Serial killers

1436
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:29,618
Justin Bieber

1437
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,180
Really querÌa be a mother

1438
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,456
But my body does not seem to
agree

1439
01:11:44,334 --> 01:11:47,735
When I imagine being on Broadway never
pensÈ see a deer bailarÌn

1440
01:11:48,471 --> 01:11:49,233
Nice touch

1441
01:12:27,110 --> 01:12:29,237
Hey Jim, you have a cigar?

1442
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,757
You Are Riggan Thomson?
To fuck...

1443
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,097
Don't be an idiot, give me a autÛgrafo

1444
01:14:03,673 --> 01:14:04,731
You're great!

1445
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,174
Oh shit

1446
01:15:05,068 --> 01:15:06,092
SeÒor to dÛnde going?

1447
01:15:09,772 --> 01:15:11,399
What will you do?
- Waiting for Jake

1448
01:15:11,874 --> 01:15:13,398
This is my lawyer, Mr. Roth

1449
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,474
Why?
- We seek remuneraciÛn financial

1450
01:15:15,678 --> 01:15:16,610
By the wounds that...

1451
01:15:16,813 --> 01:15:18,542
I don't have time for you
- Apology?

1452
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,694
You do here?

1453
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:43,599
Why?

1454
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:45,204
I just need you to
't say why?

1455
01:15:45,475 --> 01:15:47,272
TÛmalo calmly, Ed,
sÈ this is hard

1456
01:15:47,477 --> 01:15:49,104
C·llate shit

1457
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,242
C·llate

1458
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:51,645
Eddie please

1459
01:15:55,785 --> 01:15:56,774
I have wrong?

1460
01:15:59,255 --> 01:16:01,883
Why people don't love me?"

1461
01:16:03,326 --> 01:16:04,350
Eddie please, just...

1462
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,260
Please just give me the gun

1463
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,458
I just querÌa be what
your querÌas

1464
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:16,935
I spent all week trying to be
something m·s, something that I am not

1465
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:18,732
Lower the gun, she doesn't love you

1466
01:16:32,455 --> 01:16:33,183
Hello?

1467
01:16:33,890 --> 01:16:34,754
Who?

1468
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,390
Ok, no, please

1469
01:16:36,626 --> 01:16:38,150
What are you talking about?
That wheelchair?

1470
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,321
Ok, Mr. Roth esccheme

1471
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,587
Listen to Me?
Do not hang up

1472
01:16:42,865 --> 01:16:44,127
Do not hang up, ok, listen

1473
01:16:44,367 --> 01:16:47,165
Give me 10 minutes to get ordained
and we can...

1474
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:48,803
Please do not hang up

1475
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,505
Damn!

1476
01:17:41,591 --> 01:17:45,459
Pap·

1477
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:46,557
Hey

1478
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:47,820
These well?

1479
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:48,991
Why?

1480
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,297
You see something

1481
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:53,593
No, I'm fine

1482
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:55,294
I'm fine, this is good

1483
01:17:55,972 --> 01:17:56,597
You want a little?

1484
01:17:57,073 --> 01:17:57,903
Not

1485
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,136
Ok

1486
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:03,244
You think really that be·s
ready for the opening maÒana?

1487
01:18:03,746 --> 01:18:04,508
If, if

1488
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:07,613
If you, good

1489
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:08,612
I say

1490
01:18:09,619 --> 01:18:13,646
The previews are crazy not
we seem to overcome without a

1491
01:18:14,557 --> 01:18:17,492
A fire or a erecciÛn

1492
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:18,854
I'm broken

1493
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:20,852
I don't sleep like, you know,

1494
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:22,093
For nothing

1495
01:18:22,598 --> 01:18:23,394
And

1496
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:24,463
This work

1497
01:18:25,568 --> 01:18:26,933
You start to feel like

1498
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,733
A versiÛn

1499
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:31,099
Miniature and deformed
of me the same

1500
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:33,537
That follows me everywhere

1501
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:36,170
Hits Me in the balls with

1502
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,077
A pequeÒo hammer

1503
01:18:40,182 --> 01:18:42,207
Sorry, cu·l was the question?

1504
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:43,685
No matter

1505
01:18:44,587 --> 01:18:45,576
This night was not bad

1506
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,121
What sÈ
- It was weird but

1507
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:49,119
It was great

1508
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:51,258
Do you think that they gustÛ?
- Yes, I think so

1509
01:18:51,527 --> 01:18:52,391
If you, good

1510
01:18:53,129 --> 01:18:53,959
You do by the way?

1511
01:18:54,263 --> 01:18:55,025
Task

1512
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:56,527
No, I do not

1513
01:18:57,199 --> 01:18:57,893
Not

1514
01:18:59,101 --> 01:19:00,728
In rehabilitaciÛn we made do this
- Seriously?

1515
01:19:01,370 --> 01:19:02,132
What is it?

1516
01:19:02,371 --> 01:19:03,099
It is...

1517
01:19:04,006 --> 01:19:07,134
The points represent the 6 billion
age of the earth

1518
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,776
So that each one represents
a thousand years

1519
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:11,478
And...

1520
01:19:11,681 --> 01:19:12,773
This is

1521
01:19:13,015 --> 01:19:14,778
Few years the human
have been here

1522
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:17,216
150 thousand years

1523
01:19:19,021 --> 01:19:22,513
I think that trying to remind us that this is true
our ego and self obsesiÛn

1524
01:19:27,997 --> 01:19:29,464
I was a father of fuck not?

1525
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:32,732
No, you were

1526
01:19:35,805 --> 01:19:36,863
You were well

1527
01:19:37,173 --> 01:19:37,867
If

1528
01:19:38,441 --> 01:19:40,602
Exactly, only I was good

1529
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,477
I can not

1530
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:46,944
Pap·?
- Why?

1531
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:48,679
Oh shit

1532
01:19:48,951 --> 01:19:49,781
Sorry

1533
01:19:49,986 --> 01:19:52,614
You just clean with
the human race

1534
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:55,013
Here goes

1535
01:19:55,558 --> 01:19:56,252
Sorry

1536
01:19:58,361 --> 01:19:59,089
Hey

1537
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:02,056
You are becoming a topic
fashion

1538
01:20:02,765 --> 01:20:03,732
Seriously?
- If

1539
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,335
Probably you should decÌrtelo
before another person to do so

1540
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,268
350 thousand views

1541
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,774
In less than an hour

1542
01:20:21,550 --> 01:20:23,780
CrÈelo or not this is to be able to

1543
01:20:51,747 --> 01:20:53,612
That anger to Mrs. Dickenson

1544
01:21:00,523 --> 01:21:01,285
Hey

1545
01:21:01,490 --> 01:21:03,151
I pagÛ, is a friend mÌa

1546
01:21:04,493 --> 01:21:05,255
Ok

1547
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,359
Thanks

1548
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:19,970
That was

1549
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:23,910
20 years before I came
that damn suit

1550
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:24,738
I don't care

1551
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:28,810
Ok

1552
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:30,147
I just

1553
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:33,688
You know, before you come maÒana...

1554
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:34,651
No matter

1555
01:21:34,924 --> 01:21:35,720
Ok

1556
01:21:38,761 --> 01:21:40,228
I'm going to destroy t work

1557
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:43,528
But even you have seen it

1558
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,658
I did something to offend you?

1559
01:21:45,935 --> 01:21:47,266
In fact, if

1560
01:21:47,837 --> 01:21:51,238
You took a theatre that debiÛ be
used for something m·s valuable

1561
01:21:53,542 --> 01:21:54,440
Ok, good

1562
01:21:55,377 --> 01:21:57,106
I mean, you don't even know if
it is good or not

1563
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:58,604
I don't...
- It is true

1564
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:01,475
I haven't even heard a word
of it or seen something

1565
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:07,185
But for maÒana harÈ the worst criticism
there is

1566
01:22:08,090 --> 01:22:09,682
And I'm going to close t work

1567
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:11,949
I would love to know why

1568
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:14,322
Because I hate you

1569
01:22:15,231 --> 01:22:16,493
Everything that you represent

1570
01:22:17,700 --> 01:22:20,999
EngreÌdos, egoÌstas niÒos

1571
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:23,698
Totally without preparaciÛn

1572
01:22:23,973 --> 01:22:24,905
Without verse

1573
01:22:25,174 --> 01:22:27,642
Unable to try to produce
art of truth

1574
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:30,469
D·more awards each
other by cartoons

1575
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:31,771
And pornografÌa

1576
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:34,278
By measuring its value in the end
week

1577
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:37,113
Well, this is the theater

1578
01:22:37,887 --> 01:22:42,324
And you can't come in here to claim
write, direct and act in your work

1579
01:22:43,159 --> 01:22:44,558
Without going through my first

1580
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:47,429
So esfuÈrzate

1581
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:55,159
You know, that happens in the life of a person
to become a critical anyway?

1582
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:57,803
You write, another reseÒa?

1583
01:22:59,408 --> 01:23:00,306
Is it good?

1584
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:01,234
What is it?

1585
01:23:01,911 --> 01:23:03,435
It is bad?, You've gone to this work even?

1586
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:04,405
DÈjame read

1587
01:23:04,613 --> 01:23:05,443
LlamarÈ the police

1588
01:23:05,948 --> 01:23:07,381
You're going to call, let's see

1589
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:09,583
Terrible, Terrible is only a label

1590
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,249
Low

1591
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,352
Another label

1592
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:14,717
Marginal

1593
01:23:14,924 --> 01:23:16,084
Marginal, seriously?

1594
01:23:17,293 --> 01:23:18,851
Sounds like you need to penicillin
to heal you of that

1595
01:23:19,094 --> 01:23:19,924
It is another tag

1596
01:23:20,129 --> 01:23:21,096
These are all tags

1597
01:23:21,297 --> 01:23:22,594
Only labels all

1598
01:23:22,865 --> 01:23:25,129
You're a fucking lazy

1599
01:23:25,367 --> 01:23:27,164
You are a lazy malnacida

1600
01:23:27,670 --> 01:23:30,161
You're a...
you know what is this

1601
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:31,871
't even know what that
is this?

1602
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:33,166
You don't know

1603
01:23:33,442 --> 01:23:34,238
You know why?

1604
01:23:34,443 --> 01:23:38,470
Because you can't see it but
you have a label for it

1605
01:23:38,681 --> 01:23:40,478
Cofundes all those pequeÒos
noises in your head

1606
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:42,741
With true knowledge

1607
01:23:42,952 --> 01:23:43,782
You finished?
- Not yet

1608
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:45,919
There is nothing here about
technical

1609
01:23:46,121 --> 01:23:47,418
There is nothing here about
structure

1610
01:23:47,656 --> 01:23:48,953
There is nothing here about intensity

1611
01:23:49,158 --> 01:23:51,149
It is only a montÛn of opinions
fuck

1612
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:54,385
Supported in comparisons
an worst

1613
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:56,494
Truth? A couple of p·rrafos

1614
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:59,895
You know what? None of this
you costÛ nothing

1615
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:04,066
You risk nothing,
nothing, nothing, nothing

1616
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,303
I am a fucking actor

1617
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,674
This work I costÛ all

1618
01:24:14,450 --> 01:24:15,314
So you dirÈ something

1619
01:24:15,584 --> 01:24:16,312
Take this

1620
01:24:17,686 --> 01:24:20,018
These words cowards

1621
01:24:20,489 --> 01:24:24,585
Your reseÒas of shit written
without pasiÛn and mÈtetelas

1622
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:28,224
By t creased and adjusted rear

1623
01:24:33,902 --> 01:24:35,961
You know you're not a celebrity?

1624
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:37,563
Let us be clear on that

1625
01:24:44,146 --> 01:24:45,511
MatarÈ to your work

1626
01:26:04,827 --> 01:26:06,055
Give me a flat of whiskey

1627
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:14,899
6.30, friend

1628
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,471
CÛmo?
- 6.30

1629
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:19,970
It takes only...

1630
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:21,667
TÛmalo

1631
01:27:02,985 --> 01:27:03,610
AdÛnde are you going?

1632
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:05,086
It was a lot?

1633
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:07,646
Just trying to give you a range

1634
01:27:07,856 --> 01:27:09,790
It is much I can tell because

1635
01:27:10,025 --> 01:27:11,458
Your...

1636
01:28:09,818 --> 01:28:10,978
God

1637
01:28:11,186 --> 01:28:12,949
You see yourself done fuck brother

1638
01:28:13,889 --> 01:28:16,619
You seem to have a dog run over when
these hungover not?

1639
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:18,785
If

1640
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:20,954
We will

1641
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,026
We will, lev·sit

1642
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:24,162
It is a beautiful day

1643
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:27,263
OlvÌdate of the Times

1644
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:28,793
All the world has done

1645
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:31,966
Let, p·rate

1646
01:28:33,575 --> 01:28:34,940
Then you're not a big actor

1647
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:37,703
Who cares?
You are much m·s that

1648
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:41,441
You are better than these imbÈciles
theatre

1649
01:28:42,718 --> 01:28:44,151
You're a movie star, friend

1650
01:28:44,653 --> 01:28:45,881
You're another batch

1651
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,052
Don't you understand?

1652
01:28:47,723 --> 01:28:50,624
You spent your whole life doing
a reputaciÛn

1653
01:28:50,826 --> 01:28:52,020
And the volaste

1654
01:28:52,294 --> 01:28:53,090
Good for you

1655
01:28:53,595 --> 01:28:54,459
Fuck

1656
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:55,459
We will make a return

1657
01:28:56,098 --> 01:28:57,497
Est·n waiting for something giant

1658
01:28:57,900 --> 01:28:58,730
So give them that

1659
01:28:58,967 --> 01:29:00,958
AfÈitate that beard patÈtica

1660
01:29:01,169 --> 01:29:02,261
Get surgery

1661
01:29:02,471 --> 01:29:04,405
50 is the new 30, bastard

1662
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:06,364
T were the original man

1663
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,701
You painted the way for these
other clowns

1664
01:29:09,177 --> 01:29:10,075
Give the people what they want

1665
01:29:10,512 --> 01:29:12,844
In the form of porn apocalÌptico

1666
01:29:13,048 --> 01:29:15,016
Birdman, the penis upward

1667
01:29:15,284 --> 01:29:17,445
See·s cÛmo, shit in
the pants

1668
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:19,346
Around the world guaranteed

1669
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:21,887
You are m·s larger than life

1670
01:29:22,658 --> 01:29:25,422
Saves the people of their miserable lives

1671
01:29:25,928 --> 01:29:30,262
The har·s should she dump in your pants
all you have to do..

1672
01:29:42,044 --> 01:29:43,443
I'm talking about

1673
01:29:43,712 --> 01:29:49,708
Big guns, heavy missiles,
look at these people, look at their eyes

1674
01:29:49,985 --> 01:29:51,976
As shine, love this shit

1675
01:29:52,187 --> 01:29:54,212
Love the chaos, the performance

1676
01:29:54,489 --> 01:29:58,425
Nothing tonterÌas spoken
and filosÛficas

1677
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:08,194
If

1678
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:11,065
And the prÛxima time chillies

1679
01:30:12,941 --> 01:30:15,876
Exploit· in millions of
tÌmpanos

1680
01:30:16,812 --> 01:30:20,077
Brillaras in thousands of screens
all over the world

1681
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,145
Another box-office Success

1682
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:26,281
You are God

1683
01:30:26,555 --> 01:30:30,252
What do you see? Here you go, bastard

1684
01:30:30,926 --> 01:30:32,791
The severity or even
applies to you

1685
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:37,227
Waiting to see the faces of those
they thought that est·we finished

1686
01:30:37,532 --> 01:30:38,362
Escchame

1687
01:30:38,634 --> 01:30:41,398
Let us return once and mostrÈmosles
what you're made of

1688
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:44,197
We must finish it under
our own terms

1689
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:46,304
With a grand gesture

1690
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:49,671
Flames, sacrifice

1691
01:30:50,345 --> 01:30:51,505
Icaro

1692
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,311
Because doing so

1693
01:30:54,383 --> 01:30:55,213
You listen to Me?

1694
01:30:56,251 --> 01:30:57,218
You are

1695
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:58,408
Birdman!

1696
01:31:03,358 --> 01:31:06,521
Hey, this is real, or these
filming a movie?

1697
01:31:08,764 --> 01:31:09,526
A movie

1698
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:12,593
You're full of shit

1699
01:31:14,670 --> 01:31:16,228
Hey, dude, can I help you?

1700
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:19,103
You have to be careful

1701
01:31:19,341 --> 01:31:20,205
Sorry, I can not speak

1702
01:31:20,909 --> 01:31:21,807
It's late

1703
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:23,441
Music

1704
01:31:28,250 --> 01:31:28,978
These well?

1705
01:31:31,553 --> 01:31:32,918
Want me to call someone for you?

1706
01:31:35,657 --> 01:31:36,419
You know dÛnde go?.

1707
01:31:41,163 --> 01:31:41,993
If

1708
01:31:42,931 --> 01:31:43,761
SÈ to go dÛnde

1709
01:32:29,978 --> 01:32:31,673
What do you see?

1710
01:32:32,981 --> 01:32:34,278
Here is where you belong

1711
01:32:39,521 --> 01:32:40,419
Above all

1712
01:33:43,185 --> 01:33:43,981
For the music

1713
01:33:44,753 --> 01:33:47,517
Hello, seÒor?
You need to pay me

1714
01:33:51,493 --> 01:33:52,619
This deaf, idiot?

1715
01:33:53,562 --> 01:33:54,620
I don't pagÛ, est· crazy

1716
01:34:29,197 --> 01:34:32,098
It wasn't bad the first act, no?
- Good for nothing

1717
01:34:32,834 --> 01:34:33,858
You are doing very well...

1718
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:07,828
Just came to say hello

1719
01:35:08,370 --> 01:35:11,601
Est· going well here outside,
you are very good

1720
01:35:12,073 --> 01:35:13,131
I mean seriously

1721
01:35:13,508 --> 01:35:14,065
Thanks

1722
01:35:14,442 --> 01:35:15,170
I mean seriously

1723
01:35:15,577 --> 01:35:17,272
For the final scene, Riggan
look for the final scene

1724
01:35:20,882 --> 01:35:22,179
Look at all these roses

1725
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:25,182
And you hate roses...

1726
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:28,351
Est·s well?

1727
01:35:28,857 --> 01:35:29,721
You seem to

1728
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,487
You seem, I don't know how...

1729
01:35:31,927 --> 01:35:33,053
Unusually calm

1730
01:35:35,697 --> 01:35:36,629
I am calm

1731
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:39,393
I'm great actually

1732
01:35:41,670 --> 01:35:42,432
You know?

1733
01:35:43,505 --> 01:35:47,236
I have a voice that speaks to me
sometimes

1734
01:35:48,376 --> 01:35:49,365
He tells Me the truth

1735
01:35:50,412 --> 01:35:51,174
It is comforting to

1736
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:53,578
Something scary but it is complicated

1737
01:35:54,683 --> 01:35:56,310
FingirÈ not escuchÈ say that

1738
01:35:56,551 --> 01:35:58,109
Ok

1739
01:35:58,386 --> 01:36:02,379
Don't believe it·s all the people there are,
people paid up to $500 for the ticket

1740
01:36:05,994 --> 01:36:06,619
Hey

1741
01:36:08,730 --> 01:36:09,822
Can I tell you something funny?

1742
01:36:10,332 --> 01:36:11,162
Clear

1743
01:36:11,366 --> 01:36:14,062
Do you remember our last party
anniversary?

1744
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,634
Seriously, you're going to ruin a
good time

1745
01:36:16,838 --> 01:36:17,964
You remember it?

1746
01:36:18,173 --> 01:36:20,368
The party where you picked up Janet
Roseback in our bed?

1747
01:36:20,575 --> 01:36:22,440
Skip that part
- Oh, with pleasure

1748
01:36:23,111 --> 01:36:25,079
And did you get to all the guests
the house

1749
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:27,981
And you threw everything out the window

1750
01:36:28,183 --> 01:36:28,911
What I remember

1751
01:36:29,117 --> 01:36:30,084
And you encerraste in the baÒo
- Riggan

1752
01:36:30,385 --> 01:36:32,615
Why we talk about this?
- I was here

1753
01:36:33,555 --> 01:36:34,419
Malib

1754
01:36:35,690 --> 01:36:38,158
And I only sentÈ on the beach
for a time

1755
01:36:38,426 --> 01:36:39,484
Looking at the ocean

1756
01:36:39,995 --> 01:36:40,723
Riggan

1757
01:36:40,929 --> 01:36:41,657
And I

1758
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:44,524
I metÌ direct the water

1759
01:36:49,871 --> 01:36:51,566
I tried to kill myself

1760
01:36:57,212 --> 01:36:59,442
It was up to the chest when
was the first in my back

1761
01:37:00,015 --> 01:37:04,748
As if someone would like to pull
but he burned up and then

1762
01:37:05,687 --> 01:37:07,314
I was in my chest and in
my legs

1763
01:37:08,957 --> 01:37:11,551
The water was full of malaguas

1764
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:14,893
They were on top of my

1765
01:37:15,263 --> 01:37:17,060
I had to go out fighting
water

1766
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:18,690
And I went to the

1767
01:37:19,234 --> 01:37:20,963
Beach rolling as

1768
01:37:21,436 --> 01:37:22,528
A madman in the sand

1769
01:37:23,671 --> 01:37:24,535
Crying

1770
01:37:26,641 --> 01:37:27,903
You said that you habÌas
burnt by the sun

1771
01:37:29,744 --> 01:37:30,768
If, sÈ

1772
01:37:31,513 --> 01:37:32,377
T I creÌste

1773
01:37:33,281 --> 01:37:34,612
To be honest I don't
importÛ a shit

1774
01:37:44,025 --> 01:37:44,889
I love you

1775
01:37:48,963 --> 01:37:50,294
I've never known how to say it

1776
01:37:50,765 --> 01:37:51,561
What sÈ

1777
01:37:55,403 --> 01:37:57,701
I really would love to not
think about both

1778
01:37:57,972 --> 01:37:58,631
Why?

1779
01:37:59,574 --> 01:38:00,302
Because

1780
01:38:01,910 --> 01:38:03,400
I perdÌ of the time

1781
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:05,011
I don't have it

1782
01:38:05,647 --> 01:38:06,671
DebÌ have been here

1783
01:38:06,915 --> 01:38:08,815
With the two of you, you know?

1784
01:38:10,185 --> 01:38:11,550
Only the three together

1785
01:38:15,590 --> 01:38:16,522
But not what I was

1786
01:38:16,991 --> 01:38:18,652
Even I was present
in my own life

1787
01:38:18,860 --> 01:38:20,054
And now I don't have

1788
01:38:20,562 --> 01:38:21,426
Never the tendrÈ

1789
01:38:22,597 --> 01:38:23,757
But you have to Sam

1790
01:38:24,132 --> 01:38:25,963
Not really, I don't want to sound
bad but...

1791
01:38:26,167 --> 01:38:28,032
No, don't listen to it, only this

1792
01:38:28,236 --> 01:38:29,203
What I understand, seriously

1793
01:38:29,671 --> 01:38:31,195
She needed a father

1794
01:38:32,040 --> 01:38:34,372
And in its place recibiÛ
to a type that

1795
01:38:35,176 --> 01:38:37,667
It was a sensaciÛn viral
in 3D

1796
01:38:37,879 --> 01:38:39,141
It was so patÈtico

1797
01:38:39,380 --> 01:38:41,575
We will not, there are things more
patÈticas that

1798
01:38:41,883 --> 01:38:42,645
If, as?

1799
01:38:42,851 --> 01:38:43,715
Your moustache

1800
01:38:49,624 --> 01:38:51,387
Riggan, we are in the motel

1801
01:38:51,693 --> 01:38:52,921
The last scene has begun

1802
01:38:53,194 --> 01:38:54,058
Not est·s here

1803
01:38:54,963 --> 01:38:56,362
The last opportunity to
positions

1804
01:38:57,632 --> 01:38:58,656
Better go back to your seat

1805
01:40:54,115 --> 01:40:56,640
Carrie, Carrie!

1806
01:40:58,052 --> 01:40:59,451
Eddie, you do here?

1807
01:40:59,721 --> 01:41:01,484
Why?
Just tell me why?

1808
01:41:01,723 --> 01:41:02,451
Just tell me why

1809
01:41:02,657 --> 01:41:03,885
C·llate
- Eddie please

1810
01:41:05,893 --> 01:41:06,882
That happens with me?

1811
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:08,987
Tell me, what happens?

1812
01:41:09,197 --> 01:41:11,495
Why I always end up begging
for people to love me?

1813
01:41:11,699 --> 01:41:13,394
CariÒo please, just give me the gun

1814
01:41:13,701 --> 01:41:16,397
Understand was drowned·ndome
was not able to

1815
01:41:17,038 --> 01:41:18,528
You deserve to be loved, Eddie

1816
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:19,768
Seriously

1817
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,638
Only querÌa be that t querÌas

1818
01:41:24,312 --> 01:41:25,108
Your

1819
01:41:25,647 --> 01:41:29,481
And I spend every minute trying to be
something m·s, something that I am not

1820
01:41:30,518 --> 01:41:31,576
Just lower the gun, Ed

1821
01:41:32,287 --> 01:41:33,015
She no longer loves you

1822
01:41:36,524 --> 01:41:37,548
Don't do it?

1823
01:41:38,226 --> 01:41:39,022
Not

1824
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:40,420
And never har·s?

1825
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:42,327
Sorry

1826
01:41:54,142 --> 01:41:55,040
I do not exist

1827
01:41:59,681 --> 01:42:00,613
I do here?

1828
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:03,878
I don't mind

1829
01:42:04,552 --> 01:42:05,280
Hey

1830
01:44:08,743 --> 01:44:09,641
If?

1831
01:44:12,980 --> 01:44:14,072
Already reaccionÛ?

1832
01:44:14,415 --> 01:44:15,313
Just waking up

1833
01:44:21,823 --> 01:44:22,847
PensÈ that you had lost, friend

1834
01:44:25,326 --> 01:44:26,156
What demons pasÛ?

1835
01:44:28,095 --> 01:44:29,357
I was viÈndote on the stage, and then

1836
01:44:29,630 --> 01:44:30,619
Out of nothing

1837
01:44:31,132 --> 01:44:32,394
TenÌas a strange look in your eyes

1838
01:44:32,667 --> 01:44:34,567
And you were like...

1839
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:35,667
That happens to you?

1840
01:44:35,870 --> 01:44:37,030
...l est·...
- Happy!

1841
01:44:37,405 --> 01:44:38,895
Est· live, my best friend
est· live

1842
01:44:39,173 --> 01:44:39,969
And

1843
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:43,243
It happens that it is the man of the hour

1844
01:44:43,544 --> 01:44:44,306
Who is that?

1845
01:44:44,512 --> 01:44:45,206
You must be kidding

1846
01:44:46,347 --> 01:44:47,245
LÈelo

1847
01:44:47,715 --> 01:44:50,275
I don't think so, "The unexpected under
of ignorance"?

1848
01:44:50,751 --> 01:44:51,445
LÈelo

1849
01:44:53,988 --> 01:44:54,716
LÈelo aloud

1850
01:44:55,656 --> 01:44:59,615
Thomson unintentionally has given life to a
new way that can only be described

1851
01:44:59,827 --> 01:45:00,486
As

1852
01:45:00,728 --> 01:45:01,888
Sper realism

1853
01:45:02,597 --> 01:45:05,088
Blood was shed, both
literally as metafÛricamente

1854
01:45:05,333 --> 01:45:06,925
By the artist and the audience

1855
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:08,065
Blood of truth

1856
01:45:08,569 --> 01:45:10,560
The blood of fact
has been missing

1857
01:45:10,771 --> 01:45:12,762
The veins of the american theater

1858
01:45:14,842 --> 01:45:15,809
These happy about this?

1859
01:45:17,378 --> 01:45:19,778
Happy? I'm fuck...

1860
01:45:20,014 --> 01:45:21,914
This is the type of reseÒa that becomes
legends to the people

1861
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,639
Is disparÛ the nose of the face

1862
01:45:23,851 --> 01:45:25,216
Has a new nose!

1863
01:45:25,686 --> 01:45:27,449
And if you don't like we will get another

1864
01:45:28,856 --> 01:45:30,790
We will use Meg Ryan but
who cares

1865
01:45:31,292 --> 01:45:32,725
Est·n lighting candles by the
in Central Park

1866
01:45:33,394 --> 01:45:34,486
Turn on the TV, where est·...

1867
01:45:37,798 --> 01:45:39,231
Est·n praying for the
in all the country

1868
01:45:40,001 --> 01:45:40,865
What did, what did you do!

1869
01:45:42,770 --> 01:45:43,737
I have been born again, brother

1870
01:45:44,238 --> 01:45:45,466
And I can see the future

1871
01:45:46,007 --> 01:45:47,634
This work last· forever

1872
01:45:48,075 --> 01:45:50,066
Open· in London, in paris

1873
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,835
The study call· once again,
we will make treatment of books already see·s

1874
01:45:53,314 --> 01:45:54,474
Then you can see the future?

1875
01:45:54,682 --> 01:45:55,808
Yes, I can see the future

1876
01:45:57,151 --> 01:45:58,209
Such that?

1877
01:45:58,819 --> 01:45:59,547
Dresses come to that?

1878
01:46:01,322 --> 01:46:02,220
Why don't you say anything?

1879
01:46:04,191 --> 01:46:05,180
This is what querÌas, no?

1880
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:07,449
Riggan, this is what querÌas

1881
01:46:10,431 --> 01:46:11,227
If

1882
01:46:11,799 --> 01:46:12,891
Yes, this is what querÌa

1883
01:46:13,901 --> 01:46:18,634
Listen to you are going to accuse of carrying
a loaded gun, ok?

1884
01:46:19,073 --> 01:46:20,062
If someone speaks to you about that

1885
01:46:20,341 --> 01:46:22,036
It was an accident
- Ok

1886
01:46:22,243 --> 01:46:24,438
That's what that was?

1887
01:46:24,679 --> 01:46:25,441
An accident?

1888
01:46:25,646 --> 01:46:26,237
An accident

1889
01:46:29,450 --> 01:46:30,940
Listen, l·rguense

1890
01:46:31,185 --> 01:46:32,311
V·yanse of here

1891
01:47:17,465 --> 01:47:18,557
Violet

1892
01:47:27,308 --> 01:47:28,206
You rÌes?

1893
01:47:28,476 --> 01:47:29,704
If
- That is so funny?

1894
01:47:32,146 --> 01:47:33,170
I can not smell

1895
01:47:40,421 --> 01:47:41,115
What will you do?

1896
01:47:41,355 --> 01:47:43,084
PondrÈ a picture on your page
Twitter

1897
01:47:43,357 --> 01:47:45,587

1899
01:47:48,396 --> 01:47:49,522
No, you look horrible

1900
01:47:49,964 --> 01:47:50,988
Oh, Wow, thank you

1901
01:47:51,232 --> 01:47:52,130
I appreciate it

1902
01:47:52,466 --> 01:47:53,626
It's a joke

1903
01:47:53,868 --> 01:47:55,563
Not really, if you look horrible

1904
01:47:57,605 --> 01:47:58,765
You have 80 thousand followers

1905
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:00,470
In less than a day

1906
01:48:01,208 --> 01:48:03,142
Seriously?
- If, asustaste all

1907
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:05,043
DÈjame see that

1908
01:48:05,246 --> 01:48:06,042
Is already· done

1909
01:48:10,384 --> 01:48:12,352
IrÈ to find a vase for the flowers

1910
01:48:13,254 --> 01:48:13,879
Ok

1911
01:49:49,083 --> 01:49:50,107
Oh go

1912
01:50:14,041 --> 01:50:16,441
Goodbye and fuck you

1913
01:51:44,531 --> 01:51:45,793
Pope

1914
01:51:47,735 --> 01:51:51,193
Pope?
