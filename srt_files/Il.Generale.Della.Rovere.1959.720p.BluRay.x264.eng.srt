1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,493
THE FILM THAT TRIUMPHED

2
00:00:13,659 --> 00:00:16,118
AT THE 20TH VENICE FILM FESTIVAL

3
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:20,619
AND WON THE GOLDEN LION

4
00:00:21,077 --> 00:00:23,911
and THE PRIX DE L'OFFICE CATHOLIQUE
INTERNATIONAL DU CINEMATOGRAPHE

5
00:02:13,143 --> 00:02:16,144
Our women love us no more

6
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,728
Because we wear black shirts

7
00:02:20,811 --> 00:02:23,770
DESERTERS AND THOSE EVADING
CONSCRIPTION WILL BE EXECUTED

8
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,395
THERE AREN'T ENOUGH RUINS
TO BURY ALL THE BRAVE

9
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:32,354
ANYONE CAUGHT CARRYING
UNAUTHORIZED FIREARMS...

10
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:36,021
WILL BE EXECUTED
ON THE SPOT

11
00:03:34,992 --> 00:03:38,660
- Is the curfew over?
- Yes, it's 6:10.

12
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:43,286
We're lucky
it's cloudy again today.

13
00:03:44,161 --> 00:03:47,620
They can't bomb us so easily
when it's cloudy.

14
00:03:49,827 --> 00:03:51,912
It's our turn.

15
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:39,837
WE WILL WIN

16
00:04:56,175 --> 00:04:59,509
Come here!
Didn't you hear us?

17
00:05:03,885 --> 00:05:06,344
There's no point shouting.

18
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:09,468
If he doesn't speak German,
he can't understand.

19
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:13,636
Excuse me, sir.
Is there a phone nearby?

20
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:18,304
All the bars are closed now.
Do you have a flat?

21
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,221
For the fourth time.
We have no more spares.

22
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,972
There's a tire shop
just around the corner.

23
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,057
Really? Thank you.

24
00:05:29,223 --> 00:05:32,765
He says there's a tire shop
just around the corner.

25
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,933
Another nail planted
by the partisans?

26
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:38,434
Get the spare tire.

27
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:41,600
Cigarette?
- Thanks.

28
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:44,643
Thanks.

29
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:46,975
Turn right

30
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,768
at the first corner. Recht.

31
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,810
Thanks.

32
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,227
Thanks.

33
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,852
- From Genoa?
- Naples.

34
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,645
Ah, Naples.

35
00:05:57,812 --> 00:06:03,688
This time last year I was in Naples,
at the Hotel Vesuvio.

36
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:07,691
I'd open my windows
and have the sea before me,

37
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,650
with Mergellina and Posillipo on one side,
Capri and Sorrento on the other.

38
00:06:12,817 --> 00:06:16,276
- And Auntie Teresa down below.
- Right.

39
00:06:16,484 --> 00:06:20,860
We were sorry to leave Naples.
We'd come to really love it.

40
00:06:21,527 --> 00:06:25,278
Your fellow townspeople,
on the other hand,

41
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:28,360
were pleased to see us leave.

42
00:06:29,236 --> 00:06:32,653
They started shooting at us
out of sheer joy.

43
00:06:33,904 --> 00:06:37,571
Actually, I'm from Sora,

44
00:06:37,737 --> 00:06:39,988
between Naples and Rome.

45
00:06:40,197 --> 00:06:43,573
So in actual fact,
I feel more Roman than Neapolitan.

46
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:47,237
The Romans
don't care for us much either.

47
00:06:48,405 --> 00:06:53,198
- Are you based in Rome?
- Not anymore. I'm in Milan now.

48
00:06:53,364 --> 00:06:55,989
- Do you like it?
- Not at all.

49
00:06:56,239 --> 00:07:00,615
The weather's awful, and the people
are hostile and rebellious.

50
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,158
You Italians
don't like this war much.

51
00:07:04,366 --> 00:07:06,491
We don't like wars in general.

52
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:11,659
This is a just and therefore
necessary war. Don't you agree?

53
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:14,409
Yes, but not everyone
shares my view.

54
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:18,493
Exactly. And that creates
some very awkward situations.

55
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:21,786
- May I be of help?
- No, thanks.

56
00:07:22,119 --> 00:07:24,078
I should be getting to work now.

57
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:25,956
Thank you, Mr...

58
00:07:26,122 --> 00:07:28,414
Grimaldi. I’m an engineer.

59
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,373
Colonel Müller.
I hope we meet again.

60
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,958
I hope so too.

61
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:10,226
- What time is it?
- It's only 6:00. Go back to sleep.

62
00:09:11,643 --> 00:09:14,185
Were you out gambling again?

63
00:09:14,393 --> 00:09:16,853
Don't worry.
We'll talk later.

64
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,228
Did anyone call?

65
00:09:19,644 --> 00:09:22,729
- Did you lose again?
- I asked you a question.

66
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,521
How would I know?
Ask Maria.

67
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:44,649
- Maria.
- Who is it?

68
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:47,149
It's me.
Did anyone call?

69
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:50,525
Yes. That lawyer, Mr. Borghesio,
called twice.

70
00:09:50,692 --> 00:09:52,567
- No one else?
- No.

71
00:09:52,734 --> 00:09:56,235
- Oh, yes - Mrs. Camelli.
- Cantelli. What did she want?

72
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:59,527
She said, "Tell the colonel
that my brother's been released."

73
00:09:59,736 --> 00:10:02,905
She sends her regards and thanks.
- Released? Are you sure?

74
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:06,572
Yes, she said he's back home.

75
00:10:06,739 --> 00:10:10,031
Released!
I don't understand these Germans.

76
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,324
- Shall I make some coffee?
- No, go back to sleep.

77
00:10:13,991 --> 00:10:17,908
Oh, and a package arrived.
I put it in the dining room.

78
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:33,409
THIS PACKAGE IS FOR MY FATHER.
I HOPE YOU'LL GET IT TO HIM.

79
00:10:44,621 --> 00:10:46,704
Salami again.

80
00:11:20,376 --> 00:11:22,795
They already cut off
the electricity.

81
00:11:35,214 --> 00:11:39,465
Valeria, I’m in trouble.
You have to help me.

82
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,216
What do you want?

83
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:45,008
Give me something I can pawn.
Just for a few days.

84
00:11:45,174 --> 00:11:49,174
You had a wad of big bills
Iast night.

85
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:51,634
I’m an unlucky bastard.

86
00:11:51,925 --> 00:11:56,843
Borghesio gave me
100,000 lira for his son,

87
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,511
and I gambled it all.

88
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,637
I wanted to round up
the 50,000 I was owed,

89
00:12:03,803 --> 00:12:06,012
and it was supposed
to be my night.

90
00:12:06,637 --> 00:12:08,929
I'd lost the night before,

91
00:12:09,096 --> 00:12:12,304
so last night I should've won.

92
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:16,430
That damn bastard jinxed me
and won the whole thing.

93
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,139
It was an awful night.

94
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:25,347
Only God knows
what I've been through!

95
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:28,556
I'm taking these risks
for you too.

96
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:33,349
You think I don't feel responsible
having a woman Iike you?

97
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:37,183
That I don't feel bad
not giving you the life you deserve?

98
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:41,853
You've said that for three months.
I know it by heart.

99
00:12:42,311 --> 00:12:44,561
You can't charm me anymore.

100
00:12:59,274 --> 00:13:00,523
Hello?

101
00:13:00,689 --> 00:13:02,273
My dear Mr. Borghesio.

102
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:05,565
No, you're not disturbing me.
I’m an early bird.

103
00:13:06,107 --> 00:13:07,482
News?

104
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,566
Things are Iooking up.

105
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:14,901
What was that?

106
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:17,317
Did the order come through?

107
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:20,277
No, not yet.

108
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:25,111
But everything will be
sorted out this morning.

109
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:28,487
I know.

110
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:30,654
I understand your concern.

111
00:13:32,446 --> 00:13:35,863
But don't despair.
Go ahead and tell your wife.

112
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:39,239
Tell the poor woman
everything will be all right.

113
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,281
You have to trust me.

114
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:47,490
I've taken this matter to heart.
I don't even sleep nights.

115
00:13:47,657 --> 00:13:49,407
I've spoken to him.

116
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:53,241
It will be resolved today,
come what may.

117
00:13:53,408 --> 00:13:55,367
Don't worry.

118
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,242
Don't worry.

119
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:13,581
Valeria, this is
a matter of Iife and death.

120
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,415
I must give that stingy German
the 50,000 I owe him before noon

121
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:22,665
or he'll send Mr. Borghesio's son
to Germany.

122
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:24,790
What's that to me?

123
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:28,291
Give me something I can pawn
just for two days -

124
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:31,832
You already made off
with my emerald earrings.

125
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,042
I’ll get them back, I swear.
Don't you believe me?

126
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,293
- No.
- Don't be so cruel.

127
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:42,877
I swear I won't gamble anymore.
- Do what you Iike.

128
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,502
I’m leaving anyway.
- Where are you going?

129
00:14:45,669 --> 00:14:48,128
Turin. I got a job
at a radio station.

130
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:51,004
- Doing what?
- Singing, you fool!

131
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:54,962
Dancing and acting.
I'll start living at last!

132
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,588
You don't realize
that these are wretched times,

133
00:15:01,297 --> 00:15:03,547
full of danger.

134
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:08,298
But I'll do anything.
I've got some irons in the fire.

135
00:15:09,132 --> 00:15:13,132
I'm organizing some shows
for the armed forces.

136
00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:18,511
When the war ends,
I’ll put you on stage in revues.

137
00:15:18,678 --> 00:15:21,136
All your friends will envy you.

138
00:15:21,303 --> 00:15:23,387
You've made lots of promises.

139
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:28,180
Can I help it
if all my assets are down south?

140
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:33,305
"Down south" again! I’m not sure
the south even exists anymore.

141
00:15:37,097 --> 00:15:38,513
Well?

142
00:15:40,263 --> 00:15:41,764
Well, what?

143
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:45,056
If you'd just lend me
your necklace and bracelet -

144
00:15:45,264 --> 00:15:47,890
And my ring and brooch too?

145
00:15:48,057 --> 00:15:51,516
I said no!
It's no use insisting.

146
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:57,892
Why don't you pawn
this ring you gave me?

147
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:01,393
The one
with the oriental sapphire.

148
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,935
Take it.

149
00:16:04,476 --> 00:16:06,519
Try pawning that.

150
00:16:08,186 --> 00:16:11,686
Think I didn't know it was fake?
Idiot!

151
00:16:13,477 --> 00:16:17,062
The man who can trick Valeria
hasn't been born yet.

152
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:22,187
I never said a word

153
00:16:22,853 --> 00:16:24,854
because I'm a lady.

154
00:18:09,294 --> 00:18:11,628
Doria? You can go in.

155
00:18:11,837 --> 00:18:15,629
- Is Sergeant Major Hageman in?
- He's busy, but you can go in.

156
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:35,132
- May I?
- Come in.

157
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:37,507
But give me just a moment.

158
00:18:37,674 --> 00:18:40,800
He was arrested three weeks ago
outside San Giorgio.

159
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:44,551
The prison in Marassi
sent me here.

160
00:18:44,718 --> 00:18:47,927
- His name?
- Canevari, Alberto.

161
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:51,427
- Check on that, please.
- Right away.

162
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:54,011
Canevari, Alberto.

163
00:18:55,011 --> 00:18:57,803
He's the communist
who was executed last week.

164
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:02,096
No, he's not a communist.
My husband's not involved in politics.

165
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:04,637
I swear on my little girl's life.

166
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:08,305
She said he was arrested
with communists.

167
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:13,014
But if he's honest and not involved
in politics, he'll be released.

168
00:19:13,181 --> 00:19:15,642
- But when?
- That's not my decision.

169
00:19:15,851 --> 00:19:19,517
May I visit him and take him
some clean clothes?

170
00:19:19,684 --> 00:19:22,768
You'll have to ask the warden.

171
00:19:25,353 --> 00:19:26,769
Thank you.

172
00:19:31,562 --> 00:19:34,771
- Excuse me, please.
- Wait. I’m busy.

173
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:37,395
- Ladies first.
- Well?

174
00:19:38,062 --> 00:19:41,021
We're looking
for Lieutenant Michele Fassio.

175
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:43,731
He was arrested in Savona
last Thursday.

176
00:19:43,897 --> 00:19:46,314
- Are you family?
- I’m his wife.

177
00:19:46,522 --> 00:19:48,023
I’m his mother.

178
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,273
My son's never been
involved in politics.

179
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:54,316
He fought in Africa and Albania
and received a silver medal.

180
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,272
You said Michele Fassio?

181
00:19:56,481 --> 00:19:58,523
Please, Miss Sieglinde.

182
00:20:05,524 --> 00:20:08,609
Lieutenant Michele Fassio,
son of Angelo and Matilde Masuero,

183
00:20:08,859 --> 00:20:11,985
born in Varigotti
on the June 8, 1916?

184
00:20:12,151 --> 00:20:13,235
Yes.

185
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:16,651
Lieutenant Fassio was arrested

186
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:22,736
for being a member of the armed
brigades that attack our troops

187
00:20:22,902 --> 00:20:26,778
and oppose the legitimate government
of the Italian Social Republic.

188
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,278
That's not true!

189
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:31,863
He stayed at his father's villa
after the 8th of September.

190
00:20:32,029 --> 00:20:35,741
When he was supposed
to report for military service.

191
00:20:35,907 --> 00:20:39,783
An Italian officer doesn't need
to be told his duty.

192
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,283
Calm down, Carla.

193
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:45,993
The gentleman was simply saying
that Michele should have reported.

194
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,619
You must understand :
They're just boys.

195
00:20:49,785 --> 00:20:51,577
So much has happened.

196
00:20:51,744 --> 00:20:54,410
He was upset by it all.

197
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:58,078
These are difficult times
for everyone.

198
00:20:58,703 --> 00:21:01,870
It calls for understanding
on both sides.

199
00:21:02,037 --> 00:21:06,204
The propaganda of hate
maddens the soul.

200
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,497
But don't lose hope.

201
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:13,539
Our German friends are nearly
always very understanding.

202
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:18,040
Let's go, Mother.

203
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:25,000
I told you we could hope
for nothing from these people.

204
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,543
She's a fiery one!

205
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,293
- Coffee, Colonel?
- Real coffee, yes.

206
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,835
But if it's like last time -
- It is.

207
00:21:38,043 --> 00:21:41,669
All right. Thanks.
You're always very kind, miss.

208
00:21:49,212 --> 00:21:51,879
I saw Mr. Borghesio.
- Well?

209
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:54,048
He couldn't raise the money,

210
00:21:54,215 --> 00:21:57,173
but he gave me something
much more valuable.

211
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,341
An oriental sapphire
set in platinum.

212
00:22:00,549 --> 00:22:02,509
That's of no use to me.

213
00:22:02,675 --> 00:22:05,092
I said 50,000, and that's that.

214
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:08,260
- But this is worth much more.
- I want the money.

215
00:22:08,426 --> 00:22:12,136
- Precious stones are a good investment.
- But money can't be traced.

216
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:15,218
- A sapphire is a sapphire.
- I want the money.

217
00:22:15,385 --> 00:22:18,677
Don't be stubborn.
Where would I get it?

218
00:22:18,886 --> 00:22:20,302
It's simple.

219
00:22:20,469 --> 00:22:23,470
If that ring is worth
more than 50,000 lira,

220
00:22:23,637 --> 00:22:26,638
sell it and keep the rest.

221
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,388
But it's a shame.
I wanted you to have it.

222
00:22:29,554 --> 00:22:32,847
You'll marry one day,
won't you?

223
00:22:33,014 --> 00:22:36,973
"One day..."
So much could happen before then.

224
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,765
Here's your coffee.

225
00:22:38,931 --> 00:22:41,224
So we're agreed then.

226
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:44,058
AIways at your service.

227
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:47,350
Thanks for everything,
Sergeant Major. Good-bye.

228
00:22:50,434 --> 00:22:53,476
Shall we help Mrs. Fassio?

229
00:22:53,643 --> 00:22:56,559
No, it's a lost cause,

230
00:22:56,726 --> 00:22:59,185
and I don't Iike that woman.

231
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:01,102
I do.

232
00:23:03,895 --> 00:23:07,687
Remember: I’ll be waiting
tomorrow morning.

233
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,354
I’ll be here.

234
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:29,110
Ladies, I’ll be waiting
in that bar.

235
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:30,944
I have good news.

236
00:23:54,572 --> 00:23:57,114
Please sit down.

237
00:23:59,032 --> 00:24:00,323
Have a seat.

238
00:24:02,991 --> 00:24:06,199
I am Colonel Grimaldi.

239
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:14,034
The Gospel says,
"Judge not, lest ye be judged."

240
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,700
Don't be fooled
by appearances, ma'am.

241
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:20,159
I told you my name,

242
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,743
but don't ask why I’m friends
with the Germans.

243
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,827
These blue stripes show
I served my country

244
00:24:27,994 --> 00:24:30,494
with loyalty and honor.

245
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:34,580
Our country that's so scorned
and downtrodden.

246
00:24:34,872 --> 00:24:36,956
Three coffees - real ones.

247
00:24:37,206 --> 00:24:39,206
- Neapolitan style?
- Yes.

248
00:24:39,415 --> 00:24:42,707
Forgive me for approaching you
so abruptly,

249
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:45,542
but these are dangerous times.

250
00:24:46,458 --> 00:24:48,750
I’ll get to the point.

251
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:52,333
I must be discreet
about certain matters,

252
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,043
just as you must be
about others.

253
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,044
I trust
I've made myself clear.

254
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:05,628
I mean that,
given the circumstances,

255
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:11,046
we must exercise
a certain discretion.

256
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:13,755
Listen, Colonel,
Iet's be very clear.

257
00:25:13,922 --> 00:25:16,797
If you can help my husband,
just tell me how.

258
00:25:16,963 --> 00:25:19,923
- Carla!
- Let's get to the crux of it.

259
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,549
You asked me
if I can help your husband.

260
00:25:23,715 --> 00:25:28,091
I'm saying, "Within the limits
of my capacity."

261
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:34,715
But whether true or false,
the accusations are very serious.

262
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:38,800
Someone's waiting for me -
a case very related to yours.

263
00:25:38,966 --> 00:25:42,467
I hope I've been
of some small help to him.

264
00:25:42,634 --> 00:25:45,885
We Italians
must help each other,

265
00:25:46,093 --> 00:25:48,593
despite the hatred.

266
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,888
Excuse me.
I’ll be right back.

267
00:25:53,805 --> 00:25:56,806
He seems
Iike a good person.

268
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:14,017
You can relax.
Your son won't be sent away.

269
00:26:14,184 --> 00:26:19,018
Thank you for all you've done,
and all you will do.

270
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:22,561
But do you think
he'll be released?

271
00:26:22,727 --> 00:26:26,561
We can't expect too much.
Let's just be glad he's not Ieaving.

272
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:28,603
Then we'll see about the rest.

273
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:32,438
I have a little business proposal.
- Go ahead.

274
00:26:32,604 --> 00:26:37,439
Two ladies
are in financial trouble

275
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:40,522
and need to sell
a family heirloom.

276
00:26:41,606 --> 00:26:43,731
An oriental sapphire.

277
00:26:44,773 --> 00:26:45,732
Very nice.

278
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,274
A marvelous stone.
Only 50,000 lira.

279
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,857
50,000?
Where would I get that?

280
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:56,025
To raise the 100,000 lira
I gave you,

281
00:26:56,233 --> 00:27:01,276
I had to mortgage my house
on very unfavorable terms.

282
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:02,443
I can imagine.

283
00:27:02,609 --> 00:27:05,610
But I can show it
to someone else.

284
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:09,488
No, don't bother.
Good-bye, sir.

285
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:11,822
- Thank you so much.
- Don't worry.

286
00:27:26,449 --> 00:27:27,825
Forgive me.

287
00:27:27,991 --> 00:27:31,074
You haven't drunk your coffee?
It's the real stuff.

288
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,033
We always drink
real coffee at home.

289
00:27:34,866 --> 00:27:36,826
We have tons of it.

290
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:38,992
Don't mind her.

291
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,035
She's beside herself.
Don't abandon us.

292
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,910
Don't worry.

293
00:27:44,118 --> 00:27:49,328
Colonel, if there's
anything you need -

294
00:27:49,494 --> 00:27:53,079
You think Michele will be freed
because his father's rich,

295
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:57,371
but what about all the others
they've arrested?

296
00:27:57,538 --> 00:28:00,456
Will you pay for them all?
- Leave it to me.

297
00:28:00,622 --> 00:28:02,122
Where can I find you?

298
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:04,247
Call us.
The name is Fassio.

299
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:07,082
86386.

300
00:28:08,747 --> 00:28:12,623
Fassio... 86386.

301
00:28:12,915 --> 00:28:14,374
Very good.

302
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:20,167
I hope to have news
about your son soon.

303
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:21,584
Thank you.

304
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,085
Good-bye.

305
00:28:47,465 --> 00:28:50,673
No news
from the front at Anzio.

306
00:28:50,841 --> 00:28:55,007
An enemy bomber
was destroyed by our fighters.

307
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:58,675
Two Italian planes are missing.

308
00:28:58,842 --> 00:29:00,884
This has been the news...

309
00:29:01,051 --> 00:29:02,551
Hello, Mrs. Pina.

310
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,718
I have a bargain for you,
an oriental sapphire.

311
00:29:04,969 --> 00:29:09,553
It was my mother's.
One of a kind. Just 100,000 lira.

312
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,095
It's lovely, but I can't.

313
00:29:12,303 --> 00:29:15,262
You can give me part now
and the rest later.

314
00:29:15,471 --> 00:29:18,887
I'd love to, but I can't.
These are hard times.

315
00:29:19,096 --> 00:29:23,221
Let's say 50,000 now,
and you cancel my tab.

316
00:29:23,388 --> 00:29:25,888
You mustn't tempt me.
I really can't.

317
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,597
I managed
to find some meat.

318
00:29:28,805 --> 00:29:30,305
Hello.

319
00:29:30,763 --> 00:29:32,723
What's going on?

320
00:29:32,931 --> 00:29:36,098
Just a little business matter.
Bye, Michele.

321
00:29:36,473 --> 00:29:37,807
Good-bye.

322
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:49,269
It's a real bargain.
An oriental sapphire.

323
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,895
Just look at it.
I thought of you.

324
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:54,979
- It's beautiful.
- 80,000 lira.

325
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,855
It's lovely,
but I'm not interested.

326
00:29:58,438 --> 00:30:00,772
I’m sorry, but no.

327
00:30:00,981 --> 00:30:03,606
- You're sure?
- I’m sorry.

328
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:05,815
It is very beautiful though.

329
00:30:10,148 --> 00:30:11,773
It's a bargain.

330
00:30:11,982 --> 00:30:14,608
An oriental sapphire.

331
00:30:15,483 --> 00:30:18,649
It belongs to a Jewish woman.
She has to sell.

332
00:30:18,816 --> 00:30:22,984
She'll take 70,000 lira.
- No, thanks. I’m not interested.

333
00:31:04,367 --> 00:31:06,120
We're closed until 2:00.

334
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:09,328
I'm a friend of Miss Olga's.
Open up, please.

335
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:12,870
- She's eating.
- Tell her it's an old friend.

336
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:14,328
Who is it?

337
00:31:15,996 --> 00:31:17,454
Olga, it's me.

338
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:20,247
Emanuele!

339
00:31:31,998 --> 00:31:33,624
How did you find me?

340
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,624
I ran into a friend of yours
the other day - Evelina.

341
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:40,750
The other day?
She left three weeks ago.

342
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:45,126
I wanted to come earlier,
but I've been so busy.

343
00:31:45,334 --> 00:31:47,001
I can imagine.

344
00:31:47,167 --> 00:31:49,335
So why have you come now?

345
00:31:51,418 --> 00:31:55,628
I’m so happy to see you.
I thought you'd feel the same.

346
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:57,212
Really?

347
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:01,796
- I see I was wrong.
- That's right. You were wrong.

348
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,546
- Good-bye, then.
- Olga, it's getting cold.

349
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:10,005
- Madam Vera!
- Emanuele!

350
00:32:11,881 --> 00:32:13,506
What a surprise!

351
00:32:13,672 --> 00:32:15,840
How are you?
What brings you to Genoa?

352
00:32:16,007 --> 00:32:19,090
The house in Livorno was bombed,
so I was sent here.

353
00:32:19,257 --> 00:32:21,508
Why didn't you tell me
Emanuele was here?

354
00:32:21,674 --> 00:32:23,674
Have you eaten?
- Not really.

355
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:26,469
- Join us for lunch.
- I don't want to impose.

356
00:32:26,677 --> 00:32:29,303
Don't be silly.
Come on.

357
00:32:29,512 --> 00:32:33,637
We have to catch up.
I haven't seen you in years!

358
00:32:34,929 --> 00:32:36,013
Do you mind?

359
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:38,472
Me? She's the boss.

360
00:32:40,347 --> 00:32:43,265
All right, then.

361
00:32:43,431 --> 00:32:44,972
Come with me.

362
00:32:51,223 --> 00:32:53,682
Let him sit down.
Olga!

363
00:32:53,849 --> 00:32:57,725
- Hello, ladies.
- Serve the food, please.

364
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,768
What have you been up to?
Where have you been?

365
00:33:03,932 --> 00:33:05,307
Here and there.

366
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:06,975
Sometimes up,
sometimes down.

367
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:09,642
Right. Sometimes up,
sometimes down.

368
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:14,559
But you're looking good,
Madam Vera.

369
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,935
- Oh, I get by.
- How's business?

370
00:33:17,102 --> 00:33:21,811
Not good. With the curfew at 9:00
and everyone so worried -

371
00:33:21,978 --> 00:33:23,560
I know.

372
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,395
What about you?
Apart from gambling.

373
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,479
I've given that up... more or less.

374
00:33:30,646 --> 00:33:33,312
I’m an honest man now.

375
00:33:33,521 --> 00:33:35,313
You don't say!

376
00:33:35,522 --> 00:33:38,188
- I buy and sell jewels.
- Like you used to.

377
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:43,901
No, not Iike that.

378
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:49,443
I sell these now.

379
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
How beautiful!

380
00:33:55,444 --> 00:33:57,111
Let me see.

381
00:34:01,195 --> 00:34:02,488
It's lovely.

382
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:06,821
Let me see.

383
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,863
It's magnificent.

384
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:16,073
It's an oriental sapphire.

385
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:20,866
It's a good time to buy.
People need to sell things.

386
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:25,075
The lira's losing value,
but not precious stones.

387
00:34:25,242 --> 00:34:28,617
It's beautiful,
but what does it cost?

388
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:31,326
Not much. 50,000 lira.

389
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:34,326
It belongs to the wife
of a big shot.

390
00:34:34,536 --> 00:34:37,036
Her husband
stayed down in Sicily.

391
00:34:37,202 --> 00:34:40,328
- But 50,000 lira -
- I’ll buy it.

392
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:43,619
- You?
- Won't you sell it to me?

393
00:34:43,787 --> 00:34:47,953
But Madam Vera
and this lady here Iiked it.

394
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:51,913
- If Olga likes it -
- I’ll give you a check.

395
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,164
Don't you trust me?
- It's not that.

396
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,372
What then?

397
00:34:59,372 --> 00:35:01,789
Has it been long
since you saw her?

398
00:35:02,708 --> 00:35:05,333
- Yes.
- Since Livorno?

399
00:35:05,708 --> 00:35:08,501
Yes. Then we went on
to La Spezia...

400
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:12,502
She's changed so much.
She's always moody and argumentative.

401
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,585
If I didn't love her
Iike a sister -

402
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,378
You want Madam Vera
to sign it too?

403
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,213
Excuse me.

404
00:35:38,006 --> 00:35:39,507
Emanuele!

405
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,175
Come in here.

406
00:35:48,759 --> 00:35:51,301
If Madame Vera
or one of the girls had bought it,

407
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:53,468
you'd have taken the money.

408
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,718
So why not from me?

409
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:00,969
Why did you give me a check
when you knew it was fake?

410
00:36:07,011 --> 00:36:10,845
Here's 30,000 lira.
It's all I have. Will it do?

411
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,471
Why are you doing this for me?

412
00:36:18,889 --> 00:36:20,764
I don't know.

413
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,475
Or maybe I do.

414
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,726
You hurt me so bad,

415
00:36:28,393 --> 00:36:31,186
but we had happy days
together too.

416
00:36:32,561 --> 00:36:35,062
The only happy days
of my Iife.

417
00:36:35,478 --> 00:36:38,103
I live in the memory
of those days.

418
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,270
No! Go away!

419
00:36:44,729 --> 00:36:46,938
Go away...

420
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:50,313
and never come back.

421
00:36:50,479 --> 00:36:52,604
Ladies, come to the salon.

422
00:37:07,817 --> 00:37:10,817
10,000 in the bank.

423
00:37:10,983 --> 00:37:14,234
Place your bets.
Once again...

424
00:37:14,401 --> 00:37:17,069
- Bank.
- No bets.

425
00:37:29,277 --> 00:37:30,402
Card.

426
00:37:30,569 --> 00:37:32,611
Card.
The bank has nine.

427
00:37:33,111 --> 00:37:35,946
Good for the bank.
It's baccarat.

428
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:39,446
19,500.

429
00:37:39,612 --> 00:37:42,490
Place your bets.

430
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:46,158
- Bank.
- No bets.

431
00:37:57,493 --> 00:38:00,493
The bank has eight.

432
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:05,369
There's still a bank.

433
00:38:06,328 --> 00:38:10,329
Here's your money.
Take it.

434
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:13,705
Don't worry. It's nothing.

435
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,140
Send this message:
"The piano tuner has arrived."

436
00:40:43,235 --> 00:40:45,986
Stop or I’ll shoot!

437
00:41:01,572 --> 00:41:05,240
I thought I could trust you,
but I was wrong.

438
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:09,866
You know how important it was
to get Della Rovere alive.

439
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:13,700
What good
is a dead body to us?

440
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:17,491
I gave you precise orders.

441
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,200
- I passed them on.
- That's not good enough!

442
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,284
You should have checked
they were carried out correctly.

443
00:41:24,451 --> 00:41:28,035
We didn't know where he'd make land.
I couldn't be everywhere.

444
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:31,869
You're great at excuses,
but you haven't learned to obey me.

445
00:41:32,077 --> 00:41:35,536
A brave soldier was killed
Iike a small-time criminal.

446
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:40,373
If he hadn't died like that,
he'd have died some similar way.

447
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,082
What do you mean?

448
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:49,583
We could have exchanged him for one
of our generals held by the partisans.

449
00:41:49,791 --> 00:41:51,833
We could have held him hostage.

450
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,041
What you did is unforgivable.

451
00:41:54,291 --> 00:41:56,875
I want no more mistakes.

452
00:42:00,209 --> 00:42:04,084
Bury the bodies of Della Rovere
and his accomplice far from Genoa.

453
00:42:04,292 --> 00:42:06,335
They must be unidentifiable.

454
00:42:06,502 --> 00:42:09,961
And the troops responsible
are to be sent to the Eastern front.

455
00:42:10,128 --> 00:42:11,711
Yes, sir!

456
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:16,337
Spread the word
that we've arrested Della Rovere.

457
00:42:16,587 --> 00:42:18,420
Yes, sir.

458
00:42:19,171 --> 00:42:21,755
Something has to happen.

459
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,089
Someone will try
to come to his aid.

460
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:30,464
You can go.

461
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:45,022
May I?

462
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:03,483
Hello?

463
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:07,109
Hello?
I'd Iike to speak to Mrs. Fassio.

464
00:44:08,942 --> 00:44:10,277
Speaking.

465
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:13,735
This is Colonel Grimaldi.

466
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,071
Don't cry.
I have good news.

467
00:44:18,988 --> 00:44:21,238
I’ve taken your case to heart.

468
00:44:21,488 --> 00:44:23,571
Really?

469
00:44:24,697 --> 00:44:26,447
You must be strong.

470
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:30,740
This isn't
an orthodox procedure.

471
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:33,699
What are you saying?

472
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:36,740
I know a fellow

473
00:44:36,907 --> 00:44:40,616
who's unfortunately -
but also luckily for us -

474
00:44:40,783 --> 00:44:42,742
very greedy.

475
00:44:53,869 --> 00:44:55,577
Really?

476
00:44:57,703 --> 00:45:02,121
All right.
I’ll meet you in the same café.

477
00:45:02,496 --> 00:45:05,038
See you soon.

478
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:19,040
Sorry I’m Iate.

479
00:45:19,206 --> 00:45:21,957
My call must have surprised you.
- Not at all.

480
00:45:23,499 --> 00:45:27,542
I mean, you probably didn't
expect me to call so soon.

481
00:45:28,917 --> 00:45:33,962
But ever since I Ieft you
and your mother-in-law yesterday,

482
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:39,130
I’ve thought of nothing
but how I could help you.

483
00:45:39,505 --> 00:45:43,298
I got to work
and called all my contacts.

484
00:45:43,506 --> 00:45:47,549
I’m not boasting,
but I know a Iot of people.

485
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:49,007
And so?

486
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:53,382
And so?
Well, it's not simple.

487
00:45:53,632 --> 00:45:55,674
It'll take time.

488
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:58,050
And lots of money.

489
00:45:58,216 --> 00:46:02,467
You have no idea
how greedy these Germans are.

490
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:04,842
I can imagine.

491
00:46:15,301 --> 00:46:19,927
Here's 100,000 lira.
Will that do for now?

492
00:46:20,094 --> 00:46:21,219
Of course.

493
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:23,719
I’ll deliver it right away.

494
00:46:23,886 --> 00:46:25,554
You wait here.

495
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:28,387
I hope to bring you good news.

496
00:46:28,554 --> 00:46:31,596
Don't despair, ma'am.
Have faith.

497
00:46:31,763 --> 00:46:34,305
Have faith in my friendship.

498
00:46:38,513 --> 00:46:40,639
- Where's the phone?
- On the right.

499
00:46:42,806 --> 00:46:44,515
ROOM NO. 25

500
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,686
One moment, Colonel,
and I’m all yours.

501
00:47:19,856 --> 00:47:21,357
Good morning.

502
00:47:21,524 --> 00:47:23,649
Colonel, what a surprise!

503
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:28,150
What brings you to these unpleasant
surroundings? Anything wrong?

504
00:47:29,525 --> 00:47:31,401
Yes, unfortunately.

505
00:47:31,693 --> 00:47:36,485
Yesterday you said this war
was just and therefore necessary,

506
00:47:36,735 --> 00:47:41,653
and I said I agreed but that not everyone
shared my view. Remember?

507
00:47:41,861 --> 00:47:42,861
Yes.

508
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:47,404
Well, a young relative -
distant, on my mother's side -

509
00:47:47,571 --> 00:47:51,155
is a scoundrel

510
00:47:51,363 --> 00:47:53,697
who doesn't share my view.

511
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,948
His father's a famous jurist.
His mother was born a noblewoman.

512
00:47:58,198 --> 00:48:03,115
He's descended from Garibaldi's men,
but he didn't hear the call of duty.

513
00:48:03,282 --> 00:48:06,406
He didn't respond
to his country's call,

514
00:48:06,573 --> 00:48:10,782
and he let himself get nabbed -
I mean, he was arrested.

515
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:14,535
He's to be deported to Germany.
Quite rightly, of course.

516
00:48:14,702 --> 00:48:17,328
Why didn't he choose
to fight with us?

517
00:48:17,536 --> 00:48:20,286
He'd have been freed
immediately.

518
00:48:20,661 --> 00:48:23,412
- Why?
- Yes, why?

519
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:26,996
- You want to know?
- I’m curious.

520
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:30,497
Out of pride!

521
00:48:30,706 --> 00:48:33,496
That boy has a monstrous
sense of pride!

522
00:48:34,371 --> 00:48:37,664
He took after his great-grandfather.
And he said,

523
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:41,957
" If I fight alongside
our German colleagues,

524
00:48:42,165 --> 00:48:47,708
it may look like I’m doing it
to avoid the concentration camps.

525
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:52,667
I don't want our brave German
colleagues to think

526
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:55,501
I’m a coward. "

527
00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:00,669
- I’ll see what I can do.
- Can you speak to Captain Schrantz?

528
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:04,003
I don't need to speak to anyone,
my dear man.

529
00:49:04,212 --> 00:49:05,837
Come with me.

530
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,296
This way.

531
00:49:13,879 --> 00:49:17,672
- What's the man's name?
- Vittorio Borghesio.

532
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:20,630
Get me Vittorio Borghesio's
information.

533
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:35,678
This says that in addition
to being a deserter,

534
00:49:35,886 --> 00:49:38,928
he was involved
in illegal activities.

535
00:49:39,095 --> 00:49:42,137
If we believed everything
the police said -

536
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:44,763
My dear man,
I am the police.

537
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:48,513
Well, if all policemen
were like you -

538
00:49:48,722 --> 00:49:50,680
I don't care for flattery.

539
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:55,014
This Borghesio
is to remain in Genoa.

540
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:57,181
He's on the transfer list.

541
00:49:57,389 --> 00:49:59,848
- Take him off the list.
- Yes, sir.

542
00:50:00,056 --> 00:50:03,640
The problem's resolved.
He stays here. Happy?

543
00:50:03,807 --> 00:50:07,015
You're lucky you're able
to do some good!

544
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:09,725
It doesn't happen often,
unfortunately.

545
00:50:09,891 --> 00:50:12,767
I’ll give
his poor parents the news.

546
00:50:12,976 --> 00:50:16,684
Let me thank you
and bless you on their behalf.

547
00:50:16,852 --> 00:50:18,893
I don't Iike thanks
or blessings.

548
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:22,436
I hope you'll come by again.
- I will.

549
00:50:22,603 --> 00:50:24,769
And thank you, Colonel.

550
00:50:45,856 --> 00:50:47,856
I’ve got good news!

551
00:50:48,064 --> 00:50:51,400
I just need to make a call.
I’ll be right back.

552
00:51:02,486 --> 00:51:06,195
Mr. Borghesio, please.
It's the colonel.

553
00:51:08,529 --> 00:51:10,070
Mr. Borghesio?

554
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,028
Victory!

555
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:14,196
No, not Vittorio.

556
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:17,197
Or rather, yes -
victory for Vittorio.

557
00:51:17,614 --> 00:51:21,530
He won't be leaving,
and he may be released.

558
00:51:21,739 --> 00:51:24,198
I’ll tell you when I see you.

559
00:51:24,406 --> 00:51:27,199
Let your wife
know the good news.

560
00:51:27,407 --> 00:51:30,366
No, I don't Iike thanks
or blessings.

561
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:32,700
See you soon, my friend.

562
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:42,369
Madam, your husband's fine.

563
00:51:43,077 --> 00:51:46,536
The path is long
and complicated,

564
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:49,077
but it leads to freedom.

565
00:51:49,244 --> 00:51:52,244
My husband is already free,
my dear colonel.

566
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:57,661
He was shot yesterday
behind the Staglieno cemetery.

567
00:51:59,454 --> 00:52:00,412
Shot?

568
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,330
- Then why are we -
- Yes, why indeed?

569
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:12,876
- Come with us.
- There must be some horrible mistake!

570
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:21,460
How long
have you known this man?

571
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,961
I met him
three or four months ago.

572
00:52:25,461 --> 00:52:28,961
I was performing in revues
in Mondovì.

573
00:52:29,378 --> 00:52:31,462
I’m a serious actress,

574
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:34,754
but times are hard
and you have to make do.

575
00:52:35,337 --> 00:52:39,713
And if you're talented, even revues -
- Try to be brief.

576
00:52:40,338 --> 00:52:42,756
How did you meet this man?

577
00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:45,507
I told you, in Mondovì.

578
00:52:45,715 --> 00:52:48,298
I was going home
with some friends after a show.

579
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:51,883
We'd been out late to dinner,

580
00:52:52,049 --> 00:52:54,759
and that damn curfew
had started.

581
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:58,050
A patrol car
wanted to arrest us,

582
00:52:58,217 --> 00:53:00,176
and the colonel intervened.

583
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,135
- What colonel?
- Him.

584
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:06,511
Why, are you a colonel too?

585
00:53:07,593 --> 00:53:09,677
Later...

586
00:53:12,094 --> 00:53:14,678
I’ll explain later.
- Right.

587
00:53:14,887 --> 00:53:16,553
Go on.

588
00:53:17,053 --> 00:53:20,138
- He took us to our hotel.
- Then?

589
00:53:21,263 --> 00:53:24,347
Well, one thing led to another.

590
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:27,475
He made me leave my job.

591
00:53:27,642 --> 00:53:30,558
- Go on.
- He brought me to Genoa.

592
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:35,684
He promised me the world.
"Once the south is freed..."

593
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:37,685
What's his Iine of business?

594
00:53:37,852 --> 00:53:41,186
Tell me the truth,
for your own good.

595
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:45,644
I only know
he got lots of phone calls,

596
00:53:45,811 --> 00:53:48,435
and he had a lot of visitors
with packages.

597
00:53:48,602 --> 00:53:50,603
Containing what?

598
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:55,062
Clothes, food...
a lot of salami.

599
00:53:55,271 --> 00:53:59,187
I ate so much salami
that I broke out in a rash. Look!

600
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:01,230
The lady can go.

601
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:03,230
That way.

602
00:54:08,356 --> 00:54:10,315
Bring them in.

603
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:47,991
Do you know this man?

604
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:58,451
Why don't you answer him?

605
00:54:59,076 --> 00:55:02,118
Why don't you tell him you know me?
I have nothing to hide.

606
00:55:02,368 --> 00:55:04,618
Colonel, let me explain.

607
00:55:05,577 --> 00:55:09,827
Maybe I was wrong - I was wrong -
but for a good reason.

608
00:55:09,994 --> 00:55:12,119
It started with
Mrs. De Dominicis.

609
00:55:12,369 --> 00:55:15,287
Step forward, ma'am.
She lives upstairs from me.

610
00:55:15,453 --> 00:55:19,621
She was distraught one day on the stairs.
Her son had been arrested.

611
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,080
Faced with a mother's anguish,
what else could I do?

612
00:55:24,289 --> 00:55:28,498
I said, "I’ll try and help."

613
00:55:28,706 --> 00:55:30,873
Isn't that right, ma'am?
- Yes.

614
00:55:31,081 --> 00:55:33,457
Then the others came to me.

615
00:55:33,624 --> 00:55:36,915
I was overwhelmed
with their requests,

616
00:55:37,081 --> 00:55:40,041
their problems and suffering.

617
00:55:40,624 --> 00:55:42,208
What else could I do?

618
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:47,375
I tried to help,
but it was never enough!

619
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:49,625
First they wanted
to find their loved ones,

620
00:55:49,833 --> 00:55:53,668
then to send letters,
and then the packages started.

621
00:55:54,543 --> 00:55:59,627
Then they wanted me to keep them
from being sent to Germany,

622
00:56:00,294 --> 00:56:03,128
and then even
get them released.

623
00:56:03,295 --> 00:56:05,631
What should I have done?
Tell me.

624
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:08,881
Put yourself in my shoes.

625
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:11,799
I tried to help.

626
00:56:13,132 --> 00:56:16,716
Then I Iearned the terrible truth.

627
00:56:16,925 --> 00:56:20,676
That they slept ten to a cell,
standing up Iike horses,

628
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:23,718
that they were beaten
and tortured

629
00:56:23,885 --> 00:56:28,260
and packed into sealed trains
headed for Mauthausen.

630
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,593
And I kept quiet.

631
00:56:31,302 --> 00:56:34,261
I didn't have
the heart to tell them.

632
00:56:35,844 --> 00:56:38,595
Would you have rather
I told you?

633
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:40,262
No!

634
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:43,721
Better to let them hope.

635
00:56:43,888 --> 00:56:47,722
Only I knew the truth.

636
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:54,265
- Let them go.
- Yes, sir.

637
00:56:54,473 --> 00:56:57,141
You're all free to go.

638
00:57:06,767 --> 00:57:08,392
Come with me.

639
00:57:25,648 --> 00:57:28,023
Now tell me what you prefer.

640
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:30,981
You can be tried
as a colonel

641
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:34,232
for sabotaging
German war regulations

642
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:36,691
and corrupting German officers.

643
00:57:36,857 --> 00:57:39,317
Or you can simply be
Emanuele Bardone,

644
00:57:39,483 --> 00:57:43,068
son of the late Luigi
and Teresa Camarano,

645
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:46,525
born in Sorrento
on May 3, 1894,

646
00:57:46,692 --> 00:57:49,568
and be charged with fraud

647
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:53,152
and impersonating an officer.

648
00:57:53,319 --> 00:57:57,320
Is that a choice?
In the first case, I'd be shot.

649
00:57:57,486 --> 00:58:01,112
In the second,
I'd get three years at most.

650
00:58:02,571 --> 00:58:04,946
"Impersonating an officer"
is a joke.

651
00:58:05,112 --> 00:58:10,781
Article 498 provides for a fine
of 1,000 to 10,000 lira.

652
00:58:10,948 --> 00:58:15,282
It's Article 310
that's a bit troublesome

653
00:58:15,949 --> 00:58:18,907
regarding crimes
committed during wartime.

654
00:58:19,115 --> 00:58:22,283
But this blessed war
has to end one day,

655
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:26,033
and there'll be an amnesty
like last time.

656
00:58:36,785 --> 00:58:39,619
You were an officer
in the cavalry.

657
00:58:39,786 --> 00:58:43,247
You were expelled from the army
for debt and embezzlement.

658
00:58:43,456 --> 00:58:46,706
Then you were convicted
four times

659
00:58:47,372 --> 00:58:51,248
for fraud, swindling the disabled,
possession and dealing of drugs,

660
00:58:51,415 --> 00:58:53,708
and even bigamy!

661
00:58:55,916 --> 00:58:58,334
If you'd stayed in the army,

662
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,960
you could be wearing
a real colonel's uniform today.

663
00:59:02,168 --> 00:59:04,834
Maybe even a general's.

664
00:59:06,085 --> 00:59:09,585
Hageman, Bardone's accomplice,
has confessed.

665
00:59:10,335 --> 00:59:11,711
What?

666
00:59:11,877 --> 00:59:15,545
Sergeant Major Walter Hageman
has confessed.

667
00:59:16,545 --> 00:59:18,878
Then punish him accordingly.

668
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:51,966
Here.

669
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,800
Listen, I want to help you.

670
00:59:57,551 --> 01:00:00,259
Despite everything,

671
01:00:00,759 --> 01:00:02,679
I like you.

672
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:05,137
- May I say something?
- Go ahead.

673
01:00:05,304 --> 01:00:08,263
I like you too,
despite everything.

674
01:00:15,139 --> 01:00:19,349
Bardone,
I have a proposal for you.

675
01:00:29,976 --> 01:00:33,642
Of course Della Rovere
had a marvelous career!

676
01:00:33,809 --> 01:00:35,768
He married
a general's daughter.

677
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:40,644
His aunt, Marquise Barrino,
died in 1928, leaving him sole heir.

678
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:44,020
He's suspected of being a Mason,
and his uncle is a monsignor.

679
01:00:44,270 --> 01:00:46,479
These types make me Iaugh.

680
01:00:46,687 --> 01:00:49,480
I’m a self-made man.

681
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:52,313
Listen, these notes mention

682
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:56,147
that he speaks fluent English,
French and German.

683
01:00:56,356 --> 01:00:58,232
I know
a few words of French.

684
01:00:58,398 --> 01:01:01,939
"Place your bets, gentlemen."
"AII bets have been placed."

685
01:01:02,523 --> 01:01:04,315
AII bets have been placed, eh?

686
01:01:04,523 --> 01:01:07,399
You know the cause of all
my troubles? Gambling.

687
01:01:07,608 --> 01:01:10,191
I always lose.
What's worse, I pay.

688
01:01:10,358 --> 01:01:12,150
And I’ve never cheated.

689
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:16,775
I hope I won't be the first
to find otherwise.

690
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,362
This is no game we're playing,
Colonel.

691
01:01:59,452 --> 01:02:01,785
Heil Hitler, Lieutenant Colonel.

692
01:02:08,996 --> 01:02:10,454
Come on.

693
01:02:14,705 --> 01:02:17,331
Get me the senior squad leader.

694
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:22,748
What if someone here
in San Vittore recognizes me?

695
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:26,082
I doubt it. Common criminals
aren't mixed in with political prisoners.

696
01:02:26,249 --> 01:02:28,999
I didn't mean them.

697
01:02:30,207 --> 01:02:34,125
I was talking about the guards
and chaplains.

698
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,001
They often get transferred
from one prison to another.

699
01:02:37,167 --> 01:02:42,004
Chaplains aren't allowed
in the political sector.

700
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,838
I don't trust priests.
They're all spies.

701
01:02:46,296 --> 01:02:48,046
What about the others?

702
01:02:49,506 --> 01:02:50,964
Right.

703
01:02:51,131 --> 01:02:54,715
If anything should happen,
call me right away.

704
01:02:54,965 --> 01:02:56,798
May God help us.

705
01:03:01,673 --> 01:03:05,133
Hold this prisoner,
but don't register him.

706
01:03:05,341 --> 01:03:07,466
No fingerprints
and no photographs.

707
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:09,674
Keep him under surveillance
and in isolation.

708
01:03:09,924 --> 01:03:13,175
Make sure you treat him
with the utmost respect.

709
01:03:13,342 --> 01:03:16,175
- Yes, sir.
- All right, then.

710
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:18,593
Come with me.

711
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:29,095
Follow me.

712
01:03:34,721 --> 01:03:39,221
I may not see you again,
so I’ll thank you now

713
01:03:39,846 --> 01:03:43,055
for all the kindness
you've shown me

714
01:03:43,764 --> 01:03:46,347
in this embarrassing situation.

715
01:03:46,555 --> 01:03:50,681
Any German officer
would have done the same.

716
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:52,681
I should Iike to believe you.

717
01:03:53,556 --> 01:03:57,474
Give my regards to Field Marshal
Kesselring when you see him.

718
01:03:58,224 --> 01:04:00,935
Tell him that just because
we're now on different sides

719
01:04:01,144 --> 01:04:04,603
doesn't mean I admire
or respect him less.

720
01:04:04,895 --> 01:04:07,561
I will, Mr...

721
01:04:13,772 --> 01:04:15,688
Follow me, please.

722
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:37,996
Who's come in,
the Shah of Persia?

723
01:07:01,388 --> 01:07:03,346
- Where?
- Basso Piave.

724
01:07:03,555 --> 01:07:06,222
- When?
- July, 1918.

725
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:08,722
The Battle of the Solstice.

726
01:07:08,889 --> 01:07:12,098
What unit?
- 131st Avellino Brigade.

727
01:07:12,265 --> 01:07:15,558
Great soldiers.
Well done.

728
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:19,309
Will you set up my bed?
- I’ll call the attendant.

729
01:07:28,061 --> 01:07:30,561
- Take good care of him.
- All right.

730
01:07:30,727 --> 01:07:33,687
Water, sir!

731
01:07:41,395 --> 01:07:43,354
Banchelli, come out here.

732
01:08:02,069 --> 01:08:04,235
- Set up his bed.
- Help me.

733
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:06,903
Don't bother, sir.
I’ll get someone else.

734
01:08:13,403 --> 01:08:14,987
Cold, huh?

735
01:08:16,028 --> 01:08:19,904
If you're staying here a while,
ask for a different cell.

736
01:08:20,071 --> 01:08:22,487
The ground floor
is really damp.

737
01:08:22,654 --> 01:08:24,947
Thanks for the tip.

738
01:08:25,155 --> 01:08:26,780
May I?

739
01:08:27,864 --> 01:08:30,864
My name's Aristide Banchelli.

740
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:34,907
- Of the cotton family?
- I wish!

741
01:08:35,365 --> 01:08:37,908
I’m just a poor typesetter.

742
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:41,909
- Have you been here long?
- Eight months.

743
01:08:42,076 --> 01:08:43,867
Are you involved in politics?

744
01:08:44,034 --> 01:08:46,867
We're all involved
in politics here.

745
01:08:47,492 --> 01:08:50,201
- General Della Rovere.
- I’ll be damned!

746
01:08:51,368 --> 01:08:52,868
Sorry.

747
01:08:53,243 --> 01:08:56,577
You've come from outside.
How are things going?

748
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:02,494
- Help him set up the bed.
- AII right.

749
01:09:04,369 --> 01:09:07,829
- Where are my things?
- In the storeroom, sir.

750
01:09:07,995 --> 01:09:11,163
- But I need them.
- Tell me what you need.

751
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:14,874
My slippers, my pajamas,
some shirts and my wool scarf.

752
01:09:15,249 --> 01:09:18,416
And my toiletries.
- I’ll bring them, sir.

753
01:09:59,216 --> 01:10:01,675
General Della Rovere's here!

754
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:04,675
He's with Badoglio,
from the south!

755
01:10:05,759 --> 01:10:09,551
General Della Rovere's here!

756
01:10:14,426 --> 01:10:16,677
D-E-L-L-A...

757
01:10:16,927 --> 01:10:19,928
R-O... V-E... R-E.

758
01:10:20,178 --> 01:10:22,470
- Della Rovere!
- Wait.

759
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:27,679
P-U...

760
01:10:29,763 --> 01:10:31,472
Ah, one of Badoglio's men!

761
01:10:37,851 --> 01:10:40,308
IT'S ALL OVER
FOR YOUR SON MARIO.

762
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:42,934
LIFE IS A JOKE.

763
01:10:43,184 --> 01:10:46,642
THE CURSED ENEMY
IS GOING TO EXECUTE ME.

764
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,852
HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH.
YOUR SON NEVER TREMBLED.

765
01:10:58,936 --> 01:11:00,978
MY NAME IS
RUTILIO CASTELLINI.

766
01:11:01,187 --> 01:11:03,645
TO WHOMEVER READS THIS:

767
01:11:03,812 --> 01:11:07,521
PLEASE INFORM MY FAMILY

768
01:11:07,730 --> 01:11:09,938
THAT I HAVE BEEN EXECUTED.

769
01:11:10,146 --> 01:11:14,022
GIVE MY LOVE TO EVERYONE.
GOOD-BYE, MY DARLING!

770
01:11:22,774 --> 01:11:25,234
I'D NEVER HAVE THOUGHT

771
01:11:25,442 --> 01:11:27,942
DYING WOULD BE SO EASY.

772
01:11:41,527 --> 01:11:43,820
The things you asked for, sir.

773
01:11:43,987 --> 01:11:47,445
Please have a look
and then sign, please.

774
01:12:04,534 --> 01:12:06,327
Who were
these condemned men?

775
01:12:06,494 --> 01:12:09,869
Young men working
with the partisans in the hills.

776
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:13,244
- Were they all shot?
- All four of them.

777
01:12:13,410 --> 01:12:16,536
- Were the families informed?
- Yes, by the chaplain.

778
01:12:16,703 --> 01:12:19,453
- Who's the chaplain?
- Don Luigi Gavino.

779
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:22,829
But the Germans
won't allow him into this wing.

780
01:12:34,913 --> 01:12:39,123
- Savona, I didn't say a word.
- Neither did I.

781
01:12:39,289 --> 01:12:42,581
This is Calandrino, seventh company.
Anyone there?

782
01:12:43,123 --> 01:12:45,874
Calandrino, Vendetta's brother.

783
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:48,416
See you outside.

784
01:12:59,251 --> 01:13:01,251
General Della Rovere!

785
01:13:04,668 --> 01:13:06,753
General Della Rovere!

786
01:13:08,461 --> 01:13:10,294
Can you hear me?

787
01:13:10,878 --> 01:13:12,756
Good evening, general.

788
01:13:12,964 --> 01:13:16,798
My brother was a radio telegraph
operator with you in Africa.

789
01:13:16,965 --> 01:13:18,757
Micheluzzi, Fausto.

790
01:13:19,090 --> 01:13:21,133
You remember him?

791
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:26,259
General!

792
01:13:26,425 --> 01:13:30,218
General Della Rovere,
do you remember my brother?

793
01:13:31,259 --> 01:13:33,675
Yes, I remember him.

794
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:39,844
General, talk facing the door,
or your voice gets garbled.

795
01:13:43,302 --> 01:13:45,678
Yes, I remember him.

796
01:13:46,637 --> 01:13:50,013
General,
when are they coming?

797
01:13:50,971 --> 01:13:54,305
The Americans
are taking their time!

798
01:14:10,307 --> 01:14:12,433
Antonio!

799
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,101
I didn't see you outside.
- I fell down the stairs.

800
01:14:16,309 --> 01:14:18,684
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes.

801
01:14:20,476 --> 01:14:25,310
Sir, I'm Lieutenant
Carlo Maria Mida.

802
01:14:25,769 --> 01:14:28,227
And I'm Deputy Chief
Carlo Frassinetti.

803
01:14:28,394 --> 01:14:32,855
We were arrested in La Spezia
by the Germans and convicted.

804
01:14:33,355 --> 01:14:35,481
At your service, sir.

805
01:14:45,775 --> 01:14:48,025
I'm General Della Rovere.

806
01:14:49,067 --> 01:14:51,066
Be strong, boys!

807
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:21,794
- Good evening.
- Where's Fabrizio?

808
01:16:22,002 --> 01:16:25,169
He's coming on the 5:10 train.
Come with me.

809
01:16:56,632 --> 01:16:59,966
- Any news?
- He was taken to San Vittore today,

810
01:17:00,133 --> 01:17:02,300
accompanied by Colonel Müller.

811
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:04,467
He didn't go through registration.

812
01:17:04,634 --> 01:17:08,637
He's in block 5
on the ground floor, cell 39.

813
01:17:08,845 --> 01:17:11,970
- We're sure it's him?
- Of course. And so are the Germans.

814
01:17:12,179 --> 01:17:15,013
- How did they recognize him?
- They were expecting him.

815
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:18,806
- They have spies everywhere.
- That doesn't surprise me.

816
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:21,556
They were our allies 10 months ago.
- Mussolini's allies!

817
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:24,182
That doesn't change anything.

818
01:17:24,390 --> 01:17:27,640
We should have freed him
on the trip from Genoa to Milan.

819
01:17:27,848 --> 01:17:31,474
- He might have gotten killed.
- We have to contact him.

820
01:17:31,641 --> 01:17:33,391
It won't be easy.

821
01:17:33,641 --> 01:17:36,642
The guards we know
have been transferred.

822
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:40,267
Still, we have
to contact him at all costs.

823
01:17:40,643 --> 01:17:42,560
What's taking Fabrizio?

824
01:17:42,726 --> 01:17:45,727
The station's
just 10 minutes away.

825
01:17:45,977 --> 01:17:50,145
- Maybe he had to walk.
- Annamaria's meeting him on her bike.

826
01:17:50,312 --> 01:17:54,062
- Maybe he never Ieft Cernobbio.
- He'd have let us know.

827
01:17:54,313 --> 01:17:56,646
- It's late.
- Here's Annamaria now.

828
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:19,941
Here's Annamaria.

829
01:18:23,483 --> 01:18:25,358
- Where's Fabrizio?
- He was arrested.

830
01:18:25,525 --> 01:18:27,653
- Where?
- Near Piazza Castello.

831
01:18:27,861 --> 01:18:30,986
We were caught in a raid.
He tried to escape,

832
01:18:31,195 --> 01:18:34,987
but his bike got stuck
in the streetcar tracks and he fell.

833
01:18:35,737 --> 01:18:40,155
The fascists locked him up in a truck
with some other poor souls.

834
01:18:40,322 --> 01:18:42,031
Were there many prisoners?

835
01:18:42,198 --> 01:18:45,156
About 80,
three trucks full.

836
01:18:45,365 --> 01:18:48,823
- You know where they took them?
- No. I followed the trucks.

837
01:18:48,989 --> 01:18:54,950
I saw a bag fall from the one
Fabrizio was in. No one else noticed.

838
01:18:55,116 --> 01:18:57,866
I grabbed it and came here.
- Good work.

839
01:18:58,033 --> 01:19:00,992
They probably took them
to the Cantore barracks, Iike usual.

840
01:19:01,201 --> 01:19:02,367
We'll know soon.

841
01:19:02,534 --> 01:19:05,993
Two in a row:
first the general, then Fabrizio.

842
01:19:06,202 --> 01:19:10,536
But they were out to get the general.
They got Fabrizio by accident.

843
01:19:10,703 --> 01:19:13,329
They don't know it yet.
No one knows him.

844
01:19:13,537 --> 01:19:17,871
At worst he'll go to a work camp.
We can easily free him.

845
01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:21,538
He could be set free tonight.
His papers are in order.

846
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:24,706
Let's hope so,
but we should expect the worst.

847
01:19:24,914 --> 01:19:27,539
First of all,
we have to find him.

848
01:19:27,747 --> 01:19:30,872
Then we must track
every movement in those barracks.

849
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:33,540
Who's in charge of that sector?
- Virgilio.

850
01:19:33,707 --> 01:19:36,791
He's a smart boy,
but tell him to be careful.

851
01:19:36,958 --> 01:19:37,999
Let's go.

852
01:19:43,167 --> 01:19:44,959
You go on ahead.

853
01:21:19,396 --> 01:21:22,355
- What is it?
- Six new prisoners for you.

854
01:21:22,521 --> 01:21:24,396
Send them up.

855
01:21:54,069 --> 01:21:56,569
Why'd they bring you here
at this hour?

856
01:21:56,736 --> 01:22:00,194
My name's Pietro Valeri.
We were caught in a raid.

857
01:22:00,570 --> 01:22:04,611
They brought nine of us here.
I don't know why.

858
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:14,614
What are they doing this Iate?

859
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:40,037
- Wait. I’ll help you.
- Thanks.

860
01:22:43,122 --> 01:22:46,162
Don't worry.
They'll bring everything.

861
01:22:56,832 --> 01:22:58,332
What's going on?

862
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,416
Nine new prisoners,
caught in a raid.

863
01:23:02,875 --> 01:23:04,750
Who are they?

864
01:23:06,334 --> 01:23:07,917
Watch out!

865
01:23:15,753 --> 01:23:17,336
Here you are.

866
01:23:28,963 --> 01:23:30,630
My dear Bardone,

867
01:23:30,796 --> 01:23:34,339
you have the chance
to earn what I promised you :

868
01:23:34,547 --> 01:23:36,589
freedom and a reward.

869
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:41,090
Nine men were brought
to San Vittore Iast night.

870
01:23:41,257 --> 01:23:44,260
I know. So I heard,
and so I was told.

871
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:48,176
One of them is called Fabrizio.

872
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:54,094
That's the code name
for the leader of the resistance.

873
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:56,970
We're sure
Fabrizio is one of them.

874
01:24:00,762 --> 01:24:03,720
You must identify him.
- Me?

875
01:24:03,887 --> 01:24:06,929
General Della Rovere's first task
when he arrived

876
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:09,679
must have been
to meet Fabrizio

877
01:24:09,888 --> 01:24:13,097
to coordinate
the partisans' war plans.

878
01:24:13,264 --> 01:24:17,556
Fate destined you
to meet here.

879
01:24:20,182 --> 01:24:22,099
Yes, but...

880
01:24:22,807 --> 01:24:25,183
how will I recognize him?

881
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:29,143
Don't worry.
He'll identify himself.

882
01:24:29,976 --> 01:24:33,769
And when he does,
you want me to denounce him?

883
01:24:35,144 --> 01:24:38,436
You only have to tell me
who he is.

884
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:42,644
In Genoa you told me

885
01:24:42,853 --> 01:24:46,895
I was to be a decoy
for the ducks.

886
01:24:48,062 --> 01:24:51,396
Now you want me
to be the rifle too.

887
01:24:52,647 --> 01:24:56,814
For this duty,

888
01:24:57,189 --> 01:25:02,442
you'll receive one million lira
and a safe-conduct to Switzerland.

889
01:25:06,568 --> 01:25:08,485
Your task will be even easier.

890
01:25:08,693 --> 01:25:12,069
Two of the nine men
will be freed immediately.

891
01:25:12,278 --> 01:25:18,070
They really are who they claim to be:
government officials.

892
01:25:18,237 --> 01:25:22,237
So you'II have
just seven men to choose from.

893
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,989
Take him back to his cell.

894
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,243
Soup.

895
01:26:27,083 --> 01:26:28,958
I'm the barber too.

896
01:26:29,125 --> 01:26:32,543
If you need me,
my name's Banchelli.

897
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:36,502
Thanks. I hope it won't be necessary.
I'm here by mistake.

898
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:48,212
Soup.

899
01:26:49,462 --> 01:26:50,921
Requests!

900
01:26:51,129 --> 01:26:54,588
What do you need?
- Two packs of cigarettes.

901
01:26:56,463 --> 01:26:59,423
- What about you?
- Some soap.

902
01:27:16,052 --> 01:27:18,052
Good morning, sir.

903
01:27:21,635 --> 01:27:23,052
Good morning, my friend.

904
01:27:23,260 --> 01:27:24,635
Coffee for you.

905
01:27:24,802 --> 01:27:28,553
- Real coffee?
- Yes, from the warden.

906
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:30,804
He wanted to come in person,

907
01:27:30,970 --> 01:27:33,636
but he's not allowed
in the political sector.

908
01:27:33,803 --> 01:27:35,929
The Germans
don't trust even him.

909
01:27:36,095 --> 01:27:38,262
- Do they trust you?
- No.

910
01:27:38,429 --> 01:27:40,932
But they need us.
There's not many of them,

911
01:27:41,140 --> 01:27:43,723
so if you need anything -

912
01:27:43,891 --> 01:27:46,766
I could use a barber.
Is that possible?

913
01:27:46,933 --> 01:27:48,308
Of course.

914
01:27:49,142 --> 01:27:51,392
I’ll call Banchelli.

915
01:29:19,202 --> 01:29:21,994
- Good morning, General.
- Good morning.

916
01:29:23,328 --> 01:29:25,703
You're the barber too?
- If you trust me.

917
01:29:25,869 --> 01:29:27,453
I do.

918
01:29:28,036 --> 01:29:31,995
I hope you won't be sorry.
I don't do this often.

919
01:29:39,205 --> 01:29:40,664
May I?

920
01:29:55,125 --> 01:29:56,500
I’ll take that.

921
01:29:58,208 --> 01:30:00,209
Did you sleep well, sir?

922
01:30:00,792 --> 01:30:02,042
Yes.

923
01:30:02,250 --> 01:30:04,167
- Is your bed soft?
- Not bad.

924
01:30:04,417 --> 01:30:07,960
Our beds are like planks.

925
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:10,460
But I don't care.

926
01:30:10,626 --> 01:30:14,294
I sleep less,
but I live more.

927
01:30:14,502 --> 01:30:18,255
The German military court
has sentenced me to death.

928
01:30:18,672 --> 01:30:22,381
They say I blew up
a munitions train.

929
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:28,132
But it seems
they've forgotten about me.

930
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:31,592
I’ve been waiting to be executed
for three months.

931
01:30:32,425 --> 01:30:33,842
Sorry.

932
01:30:34,008 --> 01:30:36,883
Maybe they can't find
another barber.

933
01:30:40,343 --> 01:30:41,884
Sorry.

934
01:31:00,722 --> 01:31:03,764
"The wind blows
from the west."

935
01:31:15,433 --> 01:31:17,475
When did you get this?

936
01:31:21,349 --> 01:31:23,141
This morning.

937
01:31:23,308 --> 01:31:25,141
From whom?

938
01:31:27,101 --> 01:31:28,892
From whom?

939
01:31:33,935 --> 01:31:35,935
The barber,
a certain Banchelli.

940
01:31:36,105 --> 01:31:39,938
Damn it! I know the one.
He'd rather die than talk.

941
01:31:40,146 --> 01:31:42,814
What should I do?

942
01:31:42,981 --> 01:31:46,440
Calm down.
Reply with another note.

943
01:31:46,648 --> 01:31:50,441
Tell him you don't trust him.
Force Fabrizio to reveal himself.

944
01:31:55,359 --> 01:31:59,650
Write back, "Let's wait
for the wind to die down."

945
01:31:59,817 --> 01:32:02,109
Give the note to Banchelli
and wait.

946
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:41,992
Open up! Open up!

947
01:32:43,492 --> 01:32:45,743
Open up! Open up!

948
01:32:56,622 --> 01:32:59,538
Go ahead!
Drop your bombs!

949
01:32:59,706 --> 01:33:01,331
I’m not scared!

950
01:33:01,831 --> 01:33:03,956
Open up!

951
01:33:04,665 --> 01:33:07,540
Open up!

952
01:33:16,749 --> 01:33:18,625
We have
to quiet them down!

953
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:23,167
We have to calm the men down!
Open up!

954
01:33:28,293 --> 01:33:31,043
Friends...

955
01:33:31,627 --> 01:33:34,044
this is General Della Rovere.

956
01:33:35,753 --> 01:33:39,212
Show some dignity
and self-control!

957
01:33:40,212 --> 01:33:42,046
Act like men!

958
01:33:43,588 --> 01:33:46,381
Show these swine

959
01:33:47,339 --> 01:33:49,339
that you're not scared of dying.

960
01:33:49,589 --> 01:33:52,257
They should be scared!

961
01:33:52,507 --> 01:33:55,131
Every bomb that falls

962
01:33:55,298 --> 01:33:57,923
brings them closer to the end

963
01:33:58,548 --> 01:34:01,549
and brings us closer to freedom.

964
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:31,431
My wife visited me,
the poor woman.

965
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:35,431
She brought our son along.
He's grown so much.

966
01:34:35,598 --> 01:34:39,099
A handsome boy,
and not just because he's mine.

967
01:34:39,266 --> 01:34:42,767
What'll happen to them?
I won't see them again.

968
01:34:46,225 --> 01:34:48,393
Don't throw it so high!

969
01:35:17,688 --> 01:35:20,023
Let the others in!

970
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,406
- There are six of them.
- Good.

971
01:35:59,365 --> 01:36:00,532
Stop!

972
01:36:10,410 --> 01:36:11,868
Get going!

973
01:36:13,951 --> 01:36:15,536
Go on!

974
01:36:19,245 --> 01:36:23,537
How can a man who's spent
so many years in prison

975
01:36:23,703 --> 01:36:27,579
not even send a note
without getting caught?

976
01:36:27,746 --> 01:36:31,330
Now our plan's ruined.

977
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:36,039
I’ll have to make Banchelli talk.

978
01:36:36,872 --> 01:36:39,248
I hate doing these things.

979
01:36:41,831 --> 01:36:45,582
Put him in solitary.
- Yes, sir.

980
01:36:54,336 --> 01:36:55,878
Come in.

981
01:36:58,295 --> 01:37:00,128
Have a seat.

982
01:37:08,713 --> 01:37:11,089
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks.

983
01:37:14,088 --> 01:37:16,589
My dear Banchelli,
you've been sentenced to death.

984
01:37:16,756 --> 01:37:19,006
Your days are numbered.

985
01:37:19,173 --> 01:37:22,382
I’m offering you a chance
to save yourself.

986
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:26,925
General Della Rovere
admitted that he gave you a note.

987
01:37:30,926 --> 01:37:32,759
This one here.

988
01:37:35,677 --> 01:37:38,428
Tell me who it was for,

989
01:37:38,594 --> 01:37:40,594
and you'II have my word :

990
01:37:40,803 --> 01:37:45,387
I’ll have your death sentence
reduced to 30 years in prison.

991
01:37:47,763 --> 01:37:51,595
And we both know
that the war won't Iast that Iong.

992
01:37:51,762 --> 01:37:54,430
But I know nothing, sir.

993
01:37:54,596 --> 01:37:57,556
Someone gave me the note
when I came in from the yard.

994
01:37:57,764 --> 01:38:00,764
Yes, and you hid it
in your shoe.

995
01:38:00,931 --> 01:38:03,765
I was going to give it back
to the general.

996
01:38:03,973 --> 01:38:08,099
Banchelli, you're no idiot,
and neither am I!

997
01:38:08,933 --> 01:38:12,644
I know the note
wasn't for you.

998
01:38:13,269 --> 01:38:15,728
The general was using you

999
01:38:15,937 --> 01:38:18,562
to get it to someone else.

1000
01:38:20,688 --> 01:38:22,188
Who?

1001
01:38:22,563 --> 01:38:25,647
Who knows?
He didn't tell me.

1002
01:38:25,814 --> 01:38:27,647
Why don't you ask him?

1003
01:38:27,814 --> 01:38:31,272
Why are you all so stubborn?

1004
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:35,106
You know we have ways
of making you talk!

1005
01:38:35,273 --> 01:38:37,773
You know that!
- I know.

1006
01:38:38,774 --> 01:38:42,732
But even you can't force a man
to tell you what he doesn't know.

1007
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:47,776
Colonel, I have a wife and son.
I saw them today.

1008
01:38:48,318 --> 01:38:50,899
I’m all they've got.

1009
01:38:51,441 --> 01:38:55,358
Don't you think
I'd tell you if I knew?

1010
01:38:56,983 --> 01:39:00,234
I’m asking you
for the Iast time.

1011
01:39:00,401 --> 01:39:05,277
Don't force me to use methods
that go against my principles.

1012
01:39:05,444 --> 01:39:08,736
I wish I could, believe me.

1013
01:39:18,071 --> 01:39:20,029
Let's go, Banchelli.

1014
01:39:38,618 --> 01:39:40,203
Come in.

1015
01:39:44,662 --> 01:39:47,120
Countess Della Rovere is here.

1016
01:39:48,955 --> 01:39:51,662
- Where?
- She's waiting outside.

1017
01:39:53,038 --> 01:39:54,955
Show her in.

1018
01:40:25,628 --> 01:40:27,420
Colonel Müller?

1019
01:40:27,962 --> 01:40:29,502
That's me.

1020
01:40:31,045 --> 01:40:33,253
Have a seat, Countess.

1021
01:40:35,463 --> 01:40:38,379
You must be surprised
to see me.

1022
01:40:38,546 --> 01:40:40,922
In a certain sense.

1023
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:45,214
His Eminence advised me
to come to you.

1024
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:49,300
He said you would understand
and help me.

1025
01:40:49,467 --> 01:40:52,550
Within the limits of my duty,
of course.

1026
01:40:52,717 --> 01:40:55,301
But let me ask you something.

1027
01:40:55,634 --> 01:41:01,344
Our sources assured us that you
and your children were in Switzerland.

1028
01:41:01,927 --> 01:41:05,095
I must deduce
that you have returned to Italy.

1029
01:41:05,636 --> 01:41:07,096
Don't worry.

1030
01:41:07,262 --> 01:41:11,095
I won't charge you
with illegal reentry.

1031
01:41:11,303 --> 01:41:13,429
I was just asking

1032
01:41:13,637 --> 01:41:17,555
to pay tribute to your courage
and devotion.

1033
01:41:18,138 --> 01:41:20,805
I’m just doing
what I have to.

1034
01:41:21,056 --> 01:41:24,598
I haven't come to plead
on my husband's behalf.

1035
01:41:24,806 --> 01:41:28,265
That would be useless,
and my husband wouldn't approve.

1036
01:41:28,474 --> 01:41:34,100
I’ve only come out of my hope
and desire to see him,

1037
01:41:34,308 --> 01:41:36,767
if only for a few moments.

1038
01:41:37,142 --> 01:41:38,976
Believe me,

1039
01:41:39,184 --> 01:41:42,810
I’m very sorry
that I cannot fulfill your request.

1040
01:41:43,018 --> 01:41:47,186
But prisoners aren't allowed visitors
during the inquiry period.

1041
01:41:47,353 --> 01:41:49,561
I didn't ask for a visit,

1042
01:41:49,728 --> 01:41:53,144
but just to see him
for a few moments.

1043
01:41:53,770 --> 01:41:57,604
Countess,
I understand how you feel,

1044
01:41:57,770 --> 01:41:59,646
and I’ll prove it.

1045
01:41:59,813 --> 01:42:03,314
You may see your husband,
and even talk to him.

1046
01:42:03,481 --> 01:42:06,814
But think about it first.

1047
01:42:06,981 --> 01:42:11,109
General Della Rovere has been
arrested on serious charges.

1048
01:42:11,275 --> 01:42:15,443
He's calm and serene,
behaving like the soldier he is,

1049
01:42:15,651 --> 01:42:17,694
I can assure you.

1050
01:42:18,152 --> 01:42:21,778
You know what gives him
strength and courage?

1051
01:42:22,320 --> 01:42:26,321
Knowing not only that
he's done his duty as a soldier,

1052
01:42:26,529 --> 01:42:30,528
but also that his loved ones
are safe and far away.

1053
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:34,488
So I ask you,

1054
01:42:34,654 --> 01:42:40,114
do you think seeing you
for a few moments behind a screen,

1055
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:45,156
seeing you worried
and in risk of danger,

1056
01:42:45,323 --> 01:42:47,740
will be of comfort to him?

1057
01:42:48,281 --> 01:42:52,116
Or rather would it have
a negative effect on his morale?

1058
01:42:53,825 --> 01:42:56,325
I speak to you as a friend.

1059
01:42:56,742 --> 01:43:01,326
I have the deepest admiration
and regard for the general,

1060
01:43:01,493 --> 01:43:06,743
and I regret that this war
has placed us on opposite sides.

1061
01:43:07,827 --> 01:43:11,535
Follow my advice
and don't visit him.

1062
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:15,660
It would upset him greatly,
I’m sure.

1063
01:43:16,702 --> 01:43:19,828
Let him think you're safe

1064
01:43:20,578 --> 01:43:22,621
with his children.

1065
01:43:24,162 --> 01:43:27,332
Write him a letter
if you'd Iike.

1066
01:43:27,874 --> 01:43:33,333
I’ll tell him that His Eminence
gave it to me.

1067
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:37,209
His Eminence will forgive
this small Iie.

1068
01:43:38,584 --> 01:43:42,502
I give you my word
that it won't be opened.

1069
01:43:48,377 --> 01:43:50,669
Perhaps you're right.

1070
01:43:51,169 --> 01:43:53,253
If you'd Iike,

1071
01:43:53,711 --> 01:43:57,379
you could send him
some clothes

1072
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:59,796
and something to eat.

1073
01:44:00,380 --> 01:44:02,963
The food here is unfortunately...

1074
01:44:03,464 --> 01:44:05,339
just what it is.

1075
01:44:07,006 --> 01:44:08,423
Thank you.

1076
01:44:32,926 --> 01:44:34,510
Banchelli!

1077
01:44:56,267 --> 01:44:59,518
Damn them!

1078
01:44:59,851 --> 01:45:03,184
General, I didn't say a word,

1079
01:45:04,060 --> 01:45:07,434
but I don't know
if I can hold out again.

1080
01:45:07,601 --> 01:45:09,227
It was terrible.

1081
01:45:10,602 --> 01:45:12,644
Why didn't you talk?

1082
01:45:12,810 --> 01:45:15,478
Why should you pay
for someone else?

1083
01:45:15,645 --> 01:45:17,020
General...

1084
01:45:17,228 --> 01:45:21,646
God! I don't know
what I’m saying anymore!

1085
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:24,313
General...

1086
01:45:27,898 --> 01:45:31,481
do you know who Fabrizio is?

1087
01:45:52,027 --> 01:45:54,777
Drink some of this.

1088
01:47:17,085 --> 01:47:21,503
Banchelli, have some soup.
You'll feel better.

1089
01:47:34,633 --> 01:47:37,133
Banchelli killed himself!

1090
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:40,883
Banchelli's dead! Open up!

1091
01:47:41,216 --> 01:47:44,050
I want to speak
to Colonel Müller!

1092
01:47:44,216 --> 01:47:46,717
Banchelli's dead!

1093
01:47:52,843 --> 01:47:54,968
It's all your fault!

1094
01:47:55,177 --> 01:47:57,469
If you hadn't been so stupid,

1095
01:47:57,678 --> 01:47:59,594
they wouldn't have
found the note,

1096
01:47:59,761 --> 01:48:01,970
and we'd know
who Fabrizio is now!

1097
01:48:02,220 --> 01:48:05,055
Instead we have
another dead man on our hands!

1098
01:48:05,263 --> 01:48:07,596
Now go!

1099
01:48:07,763 --> 01:48:10,347
I’m not going back out there.

1100
01:48:11,097 --> 01:48:13,222
By now everyone knows

1101
01:48:13,389 --> 01:48:15,722
that Banchelli was tortured,
that he killed himself.

1102
01:48:15,931 --> 01:48:20,015
They won't believe
I’m General Della Rovere.

1103
01:48:20,223 --> 01:48:23,723
They'll kill me!
The guards themselves might kill me!

1104
01:48:23,890 --> 01:48:27,223
They're on their side!

1105
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:30,308
No such thing will happen.

1106
01:48:30,474 --> 01:48:33,684
You'll be welcomed back
as a victim...

1107
01:48:34,809 --> 01:48:36,892
and a hero.

1108
01:48:43,396 --> 01:48:45,146
Take him away.

1109
01:49:23,070 --> 01:49:25,696
They tortured
General Della Rovere!

1110
01:49:25,904 --> 01:49:28,988
They tortured
General Della Rovere!

1111
01:50:23,248 --> 01:50:27,666
Murderers! Murderers!

1112
01:50:51,088 --> 01:50:55,547
There's a letter
and a package for you, sir.

1113
01:50:57,090 --> 01:50:59,631
A letter for me?

1114
01:51:03,048 --> 01:51:05,131
Open it.

1115
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,801
There's a picture -
must be your wife and children.

1116
01:51:24,972 --> 01:51:26,722
What does it say?

1117
01:51:35,890 --> 01:51:38,891
I can't make it out.
You read it.

1118
01:51:40,307 --> 01:51:42,599
It's from Geneva.

1119
01:51:42,765 --> 01:51:47,391
"Dear Gianni, I hope
these few words reach you.

1120
01:51:47,600 --> 01:51:49,934
Our consul
told me of your arrest.

1121
01:51:50,351 --> 01:51:52,560
I’ve told the boys.

1122
01:51:52,727 --> 01:51:55,643
They were very good.
They didn't cry.

1123
01:51:55,810 --> 01:51:57,478
I didn't cry either.

1124
01:51:57,644 --> 01:52:01,977
We read the letter you wrote
after the 8th of September,

1125
01:52:02,143 --> 01:52:05,102
and we remember your words:

1126
01:52:05,393 --> 01:52:08,269
'When you don't know
which path to take,

1127
01:52:08,436 --> 01:52:11,270
choose the hardest one.'

1128
01:52:12,729 --> 01:52:16,355
The boys are fine.
They're doing well at school.

1129
01:52:16,521 --> 01:52:18,396
I’m proud of them.

1130
01:52:18,563 --> 01:52:22,521
At all times, in every situation,
whatever may happen,

1131
01:52:22,688 --> 01:52:25,522
we'll be worthy of you,
my darling.

1132
01:52:27,106 --> 01:52:32,148
We pray for you and hold you
in our thoughts and hearts.

1133
01:52:32,315 --> 01:52:36,108
God cannot permit
that we never see each other again.

1134
01:52:37,233 --> 01:52:40,736
The boys and I send you
all our Iove.

1135
01:52:40,944 --> 01:52:42,569
Bianca Maria."

1136
01:52:46,445 --> 01:52:48,113
Show me the picture.

1137
01:52:48,279 --> 01:52:50,654
They're handsome boys, sir.

1138
01:52:57,740 --> 01:52:59,614
They killed the fascist
party secretary in Milan.

1139
01:52:59,864 --> 01:53:02,656
Oh, God!
What'll happen to us?

1140
01:53:05,948 --> 01:53:08,282
They killed the party secretary
in Milan.

1141
01:53:10,991 --> 01:53:13,575
They killed the party secretary
in Milan.

1142
01:53:52,206 --> 01:53:55,374
- Camerata Gaetano D'Accosta.
- Present among us!

1143
01:54:06,169 --> 01:54:11,004
We must carry out
a massive house-by-house search.

1144
01:54:11,170 --> 01:54:13,921
Milan is a working city.

1145
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:18,296
Dragnets and deportations
would disturb its productive rhythm.

1146
01:54:18,463 --> 01:54:23,464
We can't allow our best men
to be ambushed in the heart of Milan.

1147
01:54:23,631 --> 01:54:27,090
The partisan war is a reality.

1148
01:54:27,257 --> 01:54:29,132
Reprisals only make
the situation worse.

1149
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:32,299
So you want us to do nothing

1150
01:54:32,508 --> 01:54:35,259
and wait to be killed?

1151
01:54:35,467 --> 01:54:39,425
If it were German soldiers,
you'd think differently.

1152
01:54:39,593 --> 01:54:42,093
Perhaps it's not thinking
that's called for.

1153
01:54:42,301 --> 01:54:46,844
I’ve informed the high command
on the southwest front,

1154
01:54:47,011 --> 01:54:51,053
the Wehrmacht high command,
and the Führer's headquarters.

1155
01:54:51,720 --> 01:54:53,679
I’m awaiting orders.

1156
01:55:24,645 --> 01:55:27,021
Colonel Müller's office,

1157
01:55:27,187 --> 01:55:29,729
Senior Lieutenant Haftig
speaking.

1158
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,230
Yes, right away.

1159
01:55:32,730 --> 01:55:34,355
Colonel,

1160
01:55:34,813 --> 01:55:36,897
it's the Wehrmacht
high command.

1161
01:55:44,649 --> 01:55:46,606
Colonel Müller speaking.

1162
01:55:47,356 --> 01:55:49,440
Thank you.
Good morning, Field Marshal.

1163
01:55:50,815 --> 01:55:52,440
Yes, I understand.

1164
01:55:56,150 --> 01:55:58,191
He doesn't agree.

1165
01:56:06,193 --> 01:56:09,319
He says reprisals
have the opposite effect.

1166
01:56:16,653 --> 01:56:18,404
He'll carry out orders.

1167
01:56:27,321 --> 01:56:29,155
Draw up a list of 20 men.

1168
01:56:29,321 --> 01:56:31,156
Next to each man's name

1169
01:56:31,322 --> 01:56:33,947
write his race, occupation,
offense, and sentence.

1170
01:56:34,156 --> 01:56:35,909
Yes, sir.

1171
01:56:39,367 --> 01:56:42,160
The execution will be
tomorrow at dawn

1172
01:56:42,368 --> 01:56:44,410
in the prison courtyard.

1173
01:56:45,202 --> 01:56:46,994
Good-bye, Colonel.

1174
01:56:47,577 --> 01:56:49,286
Good-bye.

1175
01:57:23,126 --> 01:57:26,794
The list is ready, sir.
Would you Iike to see it?

1176
01:57:31,002 --> 01:57:34,919
- Why are there only five Jews?
- The others were deported yesterday.

1177
01:57:35,127 --> 01:57:37,585
There are only
women and children Ieft.

1178
01:57:40,920 --> 01:57:44,545
Add General Della Rovere
to the list,

1179
01:57:44,711 --> 01:57:47,796
and the nine men
we arrested yesterday.

1180
01:57:47,962 --> 01:57:50,922
But they're in pretrial custody.

1181
01:57:51,088 --> 01:57:53,380
Just do as I say.

1182
01:57:54,088 --> 01:57:55,675
Here's the list.

1183
01:57:58,716 --> 01:58:00,676
But there are ten names here.

1184
01:58:00,842 --> 01:58:05,302
Remove Oliviero Scotti.
He was released yesterday.

1185
01:58:07,802 --> 01:58:09,844
Colonel Müller's office.

1186
01:58:11,303 --> 01:58:14,137
The archbishop's office, sir.

1187
01:58:17,136 --> 01:58:19,679
I’m afraid the colonel's not here.

1188
01:58:36,516 --> 01:58:39,016
If they're really taking us
to Germany,

1189
01:58:39,183 --> 01:58:42,017
why didn't they say
to bring our things?

1190
01:58:42,184 --> 01:58:44,100
But you're not
being investigated.

1191
01:58:44,267 --> 01:58:46,643
This is just a routine check.

1192
01:58:46,851 --> 01:58:50,060
- They're verifying our identity.
- That's what I said.

1193
01:58:50,227 --> 01:58:53,269
Damn it,
we've been here another night!

1194
01:58:53,436 --> 01:58:56,977
Admit it: You were starting
to get worried,

1195
01:58:57,186 --> 01:58:59,019
but no one wanted to say it.

1196
01:58:59,227 --> 01:59:01,062
They're sending us to work.

1197
01:59:01,312 --> 01:59:03,395
I say they're sending us
to Germany.

1198
01:59:03,603 --> 01:59:10,064
Then they'd have said
to bring our things, but they didn't.

1199
01:59:10,230 --> 01:59:12,855
That means
we'll be coming back soon.

1200
01:59:46,863 --> 01:59:50,197
- Even the general's here.
- So we're not going to Germany.

1201
01:59:50,363 --> 01:59:53,156
Why? Can't he work too?

1202
01:59:53,323 --> 01:59:56,907
The Germans don't give a damn
about Italian generals.

1203
01:59:57,074 --> 01:59:58,449
Right?

1204
01:59:58,615 --> 02:00:02,366
Maybe it's to work on some railway
or road around here.

1205
02:00:02,533 --> 02:00:06,867
They must need laborers
after all the bombings.

1206
02:00:07,034 --> 02:00:10,535
And you're not
under investigation.

1207
02:00:14,202 --> 02:00:16,743
General,
you have to do something.

1208
02:00:16,910 --> 02:00:18,994
What can I do?

1209
02:00:45,750 --> 02:00:50,126
I told you, but you wouldn't believe me.
We're being sent to work.

1210
02:00:50,293 --> 02:00:53,626
We thought they were killing 10 of us
for the one fascist killed.

1211
02:00:53,793 --> 02:00:55,711
But now there's 20 of us.

1212
02:00:55,919 --> 02:00:58,586
The general couldn't
care less about us.

1213
02:00:58,752 --> 02:01:01,920
Don't you get it?
He's a hero.

1214
02:01:02,253 --> 02:01:05,046
We're here because of him

1215
02:01:05,213 --> 02:01:08,838
and the other would-be heroes
among you.

1216
02:01:09,046 --> 02:01:13,464
You could have been spared,
but not you!

1217
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:16,423
You thought you'd win the war

1218
02:01:16,673 --> 02:01:20,841
by dropping a few bombs
and killing eight Germans?

1219
02:01:21,007 --> 02:01:24,007
Well, I’m not to blame.
I didn't do anything!

1220
02:01:24,216 --> 02:01:28,717
It's a general's duty to be a hero.
That's what you're paid for.

1221
02:01:29,883 --> 02:01:35,383
In fact, I paid you.
I happen to be a taxpayer.

1222
02:01:35,550 --> 02:01:41,176
You needn't take it so hard.
We'll work a few days and -

1223
02:01:41,343 --> 02:01:43,594
No, I didn't do anything!

1224
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:46,219
Open up! I want out!

1225
02:01:46,552 --> 02:01:48,178
You should be ashamed.

1226
02:01:48,345 --> 02:01:51,095
Why? Because I don't
want to die?

1227
02:01:51,264 --> 02:01:53,514
I didn't do anything!
- Neither did we.

1228
02:01:53,723 --> 02:01:56,599
- But you're Jews.
- That's right.

1229
02:01:59,682 --> 02:02:03,475
Don't get worked up.
You say you did nothing -

1230
02:02:03,683 --> 02:02:05,851
It's true.
I did nothing.

1231
02:02:06,059 --> 02:02:09,309
That's the problem.
You did nothing.

1232
02:02:09,476 --> 02:02:12,726
Why not? The world's been
at war for five years.

1233
02:02:12,892 --> 02:02:17,018
Millions have died. Hundreds
of cities have been leveled.

1234
02:02:17,227 --> 02:02:19,018
And you did nothing.

1235
02:02:19,228 --> 02:02:21,311
You should
have done something,

1236
02:02:21,478 --> 02:02:24,895
taken one side or the other.

1237
02:02:25,062 --> 02:02:28,187
You wanted to be in the midst
of it all and do nothing

1238
02:02:28,396 --> 02:02:30,480
but worry about your business.

1239
02:02:30,646 --> 02:02:34,064
In fact, you told me
you made handsome profits

1240
02:02:34,397 --> 02:02:37,439
while others were dying.
Very convenient!

1241
02:02:37,606 --> 02:02:41,023
Now I see why you don't
want to be executed

1242
02:02:41,232 --> 02:02:43,024
without having done anything.

1243
02:02:43,191 --> 02:02:45,358
- What did you do?
- Not much.

1244
02:02:45,524 --> 02:02:48,567
But I did my duty,
because that's what matters:

1245
02:02:48,734 --> 02:02:51,066
doing your duty
no matter what happens.

1246
02:02:51,233 --> 02:02:54,359
If everyone had done that,
maybe we wouldn't be here.

1247
02:03:41,202 --> 02:03:43,203
My Jewish brothers...

1248
02:03:43,745 --> 02:03:48,162
there's no hope for us now.

1249
02:03:49,246 --> 02:03:51,246
Let us pray to God.

1250
02:04:23,752 --> 02:04:27,128
Our Father who art in heaven...

1251
02:04:56,010 --> 02:04:59,386
Who'd have thought
we'd meet in here?

1252
02:04:59,552 --> 02:05:02,970
I waited a long time
for the piano tuner to arrive.

1253
02:05:04,595 --> 02:05:07,721
I wouldn't say
I'm a bank clerk,

1254
02:05:07,888 --> 02:05:09,761
but I'm not much better.

1255
02:05:09,927 --> 02:05:11,928
I was never a soldier,

1256
02:05:12,095 --> 02:05:15,262
but I found myself in charge
of thousands of men.

1257
02:05:15,763 --> 02:05:19,679
I was able to bear
such an enormous responsibility

1258
02:05:19,846 --> 02:05:23,347
because I believed
I was fighting for a better world.

1259
02:05:24,347 --> 02:05:27,515
Will we live to see it?
Will others?

1260
02:05:27,681 --> 02:05:29,389
I think so.

1261
02:05:37,849 --> 02:05:41,683
Excuse me, General.
I want to send my wife a message,

1262
02:05:41,850 --> 02:05:45,018
but there's no pen or paper.

1263
02:05:45,851 --> 02:05:49,396
I want to ask her to forgive me
for having abandoned her,

1264
02:05:49,604 --> 02:05:51,646
for Ieaving her
and my children alone.

1265
02:05:51,896 --> 02:05:55,397
I want to ask forgiveness
for making her suffer

1266
02:05:55,605 --> 02:05:57,856
and tell her to be strong.

1267
02:05:58,023 --> 02:06:01,189
I want to tell her I’ve always
loved her and the children,

1268
02:06:01,356 --> 02:06:03,690
even if I couldn't show it...

1269
02:06:04,732 --> 02:06:08,607
and to get my money back
from the mechanic,

1270
02:06:08,774 --> 02:06:12,733
and that I gave the bike
to Giulia's brother.

1271
02:06:12,900 --> 02:06:16,567
She should get it back
and sell it for a good price.

1272
02:06:16,776 --> 02:06:20,860
And when better times come,

1273
02:06:21,027 --> 02:06:23,443
she should take the children
to see my parents.

1274
02:06:23,610 --> 02:06:26,361
They've never met
their grandparents.

1275
02:06:40,322 --> 02:06:41,739
Piperno, Samuele.

1276
02:06:46,282 --> 02:06:48,114
Ontani, Mario.

1277
02:06:49,490 --> 02:06:51,365
Albertini, Luciano.

1278
02:06:55,074 --> 02:06:57,033
Sinigallia, Leone.

1279
02:06:58,742 --> 02:07:00,617
Pasquali, Antonio.

1280
02:07:02,450 --> 02:07:04,450
Cohen, Davide.

1281
02:07:06,117 --> 02:07:07,870
Marconi, Paolo.

1282
02:07:09,870 --> 02:07:11,871
Leggi, Abele.

1283
02:07:13,204 --> 02:07:15,121
Funaro, Davide.

1284
02:07:18,997 --> 02:07:21,123
Di Castro, Giuseppe.

1285
02:07:23,498 --> 02:07:26,748
Giovanni Braccioforte
Della Rovere.

1286
02:08:02,798 --> 02:08:04,464
Go ahead.

1287
02:08:12,715 --> 02:08:15,257
Well? Did he talk?

1288
02:08:15,799 --> 02:08:17,716
Do you know who he is?

1289
02:08:17,883 --> 02:08:21,133
- Who?
- What do you mean? Fabrizio.

1290
02:08:21,301 --> 02:08:22,801
Is he one of them?

1291
02:08:22,967 --> 02:08:25,176
He must have talked to you.

1292
02:08:25,342 --> 02:08:29,304
During a night like this,
a man confides in his companions.

1293
02:08:30,262 --> 02:08:32,138
How would you know?

1294
02:08:33,013 --> 02:08:35,764
Have you ever spent
a night like this?

1295
02:08:36,597 --> 02:08:38,972
Did he talk or didn't he?

1296
02:08:39,139 --> 02:08:41,140
Do you know who he is?

1297
02:08:44,265 --> 02:08:46,807
Do you have a pencil, Colonel?

1298
02:09:21,814 --> 02:09:25,771
PIease deliver these few words

1299
02:09:25,979 --> 02:09:28,147
to Countess Della Rovere.

1300
02:09:37,023 --> 02:09:38,606
Open up.

1301
02:09:39,398 --> 02:09:41,024
Open up!

1302
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:45,444
MY LAST THOUGHTS ARE WITH YOU.
LONG LIVE ITALY.

1303
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:49,820
Bardone!

1304
02:09:58,487 --> 02:09:59,822
Open up.

1305
02:10:03,739 --> 02:10:05,280
Look!

1306
02:10:06,113 --> 02:10:09,656
What are you doing?
They're going to die!

1307
02:10:36,162 --> 02:10:39,287
Gentlemen,
in these final moments,

1308
02:10:39,495 --> 02:10:43,330
we remember our families,
our country,

1309
02:10:43,663 --> 02:10:45,496
and His Majesty the King.

1310
02:10:45,705 --> 02:10:47,329
Long live Italy!

1311
02:10:59,582 --> 02:11:01,540
We made a mistake, sir.

1312
02:11:01,707 --> 02:11:04,335
Ten men were supposed
to be executed.

1313
02:11:05,418 --> 02:11:07,918
The mistake was mine,
Lieutenant.

1314
02:11:09,336 --> 02:11:10,961
All mine.

1315
02:11:25,629 --> 02:11:27,839
Grant them eternal rest,
O Lord,

1316
02:11:28,005 --> 02:11:29,797
and may everlasting light
shine upon them.

1317
02:11:29,964 --> 02:11:32,923
May they rest in peace, amen.

1318
02:11:33,298 --> 02:11:35,340
Out of the depths
have I cried unto thee, O Lord.

1319
02:11:35,506 --> 02:11:37,841
Lord, hear my voice.

1320
02:11:38,007 --> 02:11:42,175
Let thine ears be attentive
to the voice of my supplications.
