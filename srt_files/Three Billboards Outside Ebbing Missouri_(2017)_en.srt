1
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,180
You Red Welby?

2
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,610
Yes, ma'am.
How may I help you?

3
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:50,650
I hear those three billboards
out on Drinkwater Road,

4
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,370
you're in charge of renting 'em out,
that right?

5
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,770
I didn't know we had any billboards
out on Drinkwater Roa...

6
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,490
- Where is Drinkwater Road?
- It's the road out past Sizemore turn-off.

7
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,299
Nobody uses it
since the freeway got put in.

8
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,690
You're right.

9
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,010
We got three billboards
out there.

10
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,094
Nobody's put nothing up
out there since 1986.

11
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,290
That was Huggies.

12
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,410
How much to rent all three
of them out for the year?

13
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,411
A Year?

14
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,450
You wanna pay for three billboards
on a road that no one goes down

15
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:23,170
unless they got lost
or they're retards...

16
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,014
- for a year?
- Quick, ain't you, Welby?

17
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:27,892
Well...

18
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,210
since what I say goes these days

19
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,250
down at the Ebbing Advertising Desk,

20
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,530
I'm gonna strike you
a real good deal on those billboards.

21
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:37,410
Now, what was it your name was, Missus...

22
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,334
What's the law on what you can
and cannot say on a billboard?

23
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,210
I assume you can't say nothing defamatory,

24
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,736
and you can't say "fuck,"
"piss," or "cunt." That right?

25
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:49,531
Or...

26
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,250
"anus."

27
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,901
Well, I think I'll be all right then.

28
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,050
Here's 5,000 for the first month.

29
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,170
I assume that'll cover it.

30
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,059
And here's what the billboards are to say.

31
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,690
Why don't you write up a contract
betwixt us while you're at it,

32
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,057
make sure nobody rents them
billboards out from under me.

33
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,050
I guess you're
Angela Hayes's mother.

34
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,054
That's right.
I'm Angela Hayes's mother.

35
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,851
Name's Mildred.

36
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,460
How long before you get 'em put up?

37
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,770
Shall we say by...

38
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,340
Easter Sunday?

39
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,056
That'd be perfect.

40
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:23,860
- Hey, what the hell is this?
- Que?

41
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:26,770
"How come,
Chief Willoughby" what?

42
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,290
- What?
- Yeah.

43
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,330
- Huh?
- "How come" what?

44
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,210
- What, what?
- What?

45
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,290
Listen, you fucking beaner,
I'd better start getting

46
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,530
some straight answers outta you.

47
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,532
Put that down.

48
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:07,650
What the hell is this?

49
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,650
Hey, you.
What the fuck is this?

50
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,890
What the fuck is what?

51
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,859
This! This.

52
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,255
- Advertising, I guess.
- Advertising what?

53
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,896
Something obscure?

54
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,620
I'll say. Yeah.

55
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,460
Don't I know your face
from some place?

56
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:39,137
- I don't know, do you?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

57
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,690
I could arrest you right now
if I wanted to.

58
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,770
- For what?
- For emptying your bucket there.

59
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,450
That's... that's against the...

60
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,530
being bad against the environment laws.

61
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,695
Well, before you do that,
Officer Dixon...

62
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,370
how about you go have yourself a look
at that first billboard over there?

63
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,650
And then we can have ourself
a conversation

64
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,334
about the motherfucking environment.

65
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,297
How about that?

66
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,691
Fuck me.

67
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,535
Don't, William.

68
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,930
Dixon, you goddamn asshole.

69
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,411
I'm in the middle
of my goddamn Easter dinner.

70
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,532
Sorry, kids.

71
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,850
I know, Chief,

72
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:44,010
and I'm sorry for calling you
at home and all, but...

73
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:47,576
I think we got kind of a problem.

74
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:10,370
No, no. No, no. Go back.

75
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,372
Hey.

76
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,093
Sorry I'm late, Denise.

77
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,570
Did you put up those billboards
to fuck with the cops yet?

78
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,650
They're up-

79
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,461
You go, girl.
You go fuck those cops up.

80
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,010
What the fuck
do you think you're doing, Welby,

81
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,370
a bunch of billboards like that?

82
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,570
You didn't think there'd be
some kind of ramifications, legally?

83
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,250
What's the legal ramifications, Cedric?

84
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,170
You want me to explain
legal ramifications,

85
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,776
little punk like you?
And don't call me Cedric!

86
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:57,733
Ain't contravening no laws on propriety.

87
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,570
Ain't contravening no laws
on any fucking thing.

88
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:00,730
I checked all this out.

89
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:02,130
And where'd you check all this out?

90
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:03,132
In a...

91
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,210
- a book.
- Which book, genius?

92
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,531
Book called Suck My Ass,
It's None Of Your Business.

93
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,010
Fuck.

94
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,661
How long has this person, or persons,

95
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,700
rented these billboards out for?

96
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:22,218
...the year.

97
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:25,340
How long has she actually paid for?

98
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:27,292
The year.

99
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,894
So it's a "she," is it?

100
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,259
I ain't at liberty to divulge
that kind of information, Chief.

101
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:39,615
Mildred Hayes, perhaps?

102
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:43,490
Ain't at liberty to divulge
that kind of information, Chief.

103
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,571
Do you really wanna fuck

104
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,533
with the Ebbing Police Department, Red?

105
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,297
Do you?

106
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,417
I guess.

107
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,170
He said what? To your face?

108
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,650
No crime has been committed here.

109
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,730
Oh, come on.
Defamation of character ain't a crime?

110
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,530
It isn't defamation
if she's simply asking a question.

111
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,450
What are you, an idiot?

112
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,050
Don't call me an idiot, Dixon!

113
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:03,370
I didn't call you an idiot.

114
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,090
I asked if you was an idiot.
That was a question.

115
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,490
- He got you there, Cedric.
- That's it? Come on, man!

116
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,570
Hey! Don't go flying off the handle.

117
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,370
Why in the hell you keep that man on?

118
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:12,570
He's a good man at heart.

119
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,610
He tortured a guy in custody, Bill.

120
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:17,899
There was no...
real evidence to support that.

121
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,177
Take 'em down.

122
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:23,540
- Huh?
- Take that shit down.

123
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,771
Take what shit down?

124
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,730
Hey, boy. You think I wouldn't take
you out right here on Main Street, Red?

125
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,770
I thought you only took out
black dudes, Dixon.

126
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,850
No! No! Stop it.

127
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,978
You ever fucking touch me,
motherfucker...

128
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,257
You drunk?

129
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,614
- Are you drunk right now?
- Get up.

130
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,931
Nobody ever goes down that road anyways.

131
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:49,855
Unless they got lost. Or they're retards.

132
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:52,650
Well, don't be nervous,
is the main thing.

133
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,697
It'll go just fine.

134
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,810
Don't look in the camera, obviously.

135
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,221
Let's hold for this car.

136
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:02,017
In three, two, one.

137
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,417
So, Mildred Hayes,
why did you put up these billboards?

138
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,130
My daughter, Angela,

139
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:09,050
was abducted, raped and murdered
seven months ago

140
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,010
along this selfsame stretch of road.

141
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:13,290
What you watching, Momma?
Stupid news?

142
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,130
It seems to me the local police department

143
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:17,338
is too busy going around
torturing black folks

144
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,494
to be bothered doing anything
about solving actual crime.

145
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:23,979
I thought these billboards
might concentrate their minds some.

146
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,372
Fuck.

147
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,930
I don't know what the
police are doing, to be honest with you.

148
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,696
I do know that my daughter's burnt body
is lying six feet underground.

149
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,980
All they're doing is eating Krispy Kremes

150
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,741
and busting eight-year-olds
for skating around parking lots.

151
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,581
And Chief Willoughby,

152
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,737
why single him out?

153
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,410
He's the head of them, ain't he?

154
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,890
The buck's gotta stop somewhere.

155
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:45,410
And the buck stops at Willoughby?

156
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,010
Yeah, the buck stops at Willoughby.

157
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,455
Dead right it does.

158
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,616
You all right there, fella?

159
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,776
Looks like we got a war on our hands.

160
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,692
Can we talk?

161
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,810
I'd do anything to catch the guy
who did it, Mrs. Hayes.

162
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:47,290
But when the DNA don't match
no one who's ever been arrested,

163
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:51,136
and when the DNA don't match
any other crime nationwide,

164
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,770
and when there wasn't a single eyewitness

165
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,774
from the time she'd left your house
to the time we found her, well...

166
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,212
right now there ain't
too much more we can do.

167
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:03,730
Could pull blood
from every man and boy in this town

168
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,699
over the age of eight.

169
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,015
There's civil rights laws
prevents that, Mrs. Hayes.

170
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,330
And what if he was
just passing through town?

171
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,130
Pull blood from every man
in the country, then.

172
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,290
Then what if he was just passing
through the country?

173
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,370
If it was me,
I'd start up a database.

174
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,771
Every male baby what's born,
stick them on it,

175
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:23,974
and as soon as he done something wrong,

176
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,530
cross-reference it,

177
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,450
make 100% certain it was
a correct match,

178
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,417
then kill him.

179
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,255
Yeah, well, there's...

180
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,217
definitely civil rights laws
prevents that.

181
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,453
I'm doing everything I can
to track him down.

182
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,250
I don't think those billboards
is very fair.

183
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:50,410
The time it took you to get out here
whining like a bitch, Willoughby,

184
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:52,930
some other poor girl's probably
out there being butchered right now.

185
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,730
But I'm glad you got your priorities
straight, I'll say that for you.

186
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,093
There's something else, Mildred.

187
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,256
I got cancer.

188
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,973
- I'm dying.
- I know it.

189
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,017
Huh?

190
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,538
I know it.
Most everybody in town knows it.

191
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,450
And you still put up those billboards?

192
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,977
Well, they wouldn't be
as effective after you croak. Right?

193
00:17:15,330 --> 00:17:16,661
Well, looky looky.

194
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,650
If it ain't the instigator of this whole
goddamn affair in the first place.

195
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,300
I didn't instigate shit, Dixon.

196
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,898
Playing pool against the town midget.

197
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,250
He's right, Red,

198
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:28,450
you are playing pool
against the town midget.

199
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,370
You know, he's a cop.
You know, he's observant.

200
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,494
I always disliked you, Red,

201
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,818
ever since you was a snotty little child.

202
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,656
You still look like a snotty little child.

203
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:40,217
That's unfortunate.
I always thought you was great.

204
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:43,261
Even your name, Red Welby.

205
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,577
- Even your name I disliked.
- Well...

206
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,570
okay.

207
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:52,371
Like you was some kind
of goddamn communist or something...

208
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,771
- and proud of it.
- No, it's 'cause I got red hair.

209
00:17:57,930 --> 00:18:00,092
You know what they do to faggots
down in Cuba, Welby?

210
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,410
That's left field.

211
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:05,221
No, what do they do to faggots
down in Cuba, Dixon?

212
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:06,692
They kill 'em.

213
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,901
Which, it might surprise you
to learn, I'm against.

214
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:13,650
I'm not sure if they do kill faggots
down in Cuba, Dixon.

215
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,970
I know Cuba's human rights
record's pretty deplorable

216
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:18,018
when it comes to homosexuality,

217
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,491
but killing 'em?

218
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,894
Are you sure
you ain't thinking of Wyoming?

219
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,937
Always with the smart-ass. Jesus.

220
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,931
He's quite good, isn't he?

221
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:35,733
Hey, Willoughby's a good man.
Hey, look at me. Hey, look at me.

222
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,770
I'm talking nice to you now, aren't I?

223
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:39,215
I'm talking nice to you.

224
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,810
Willoughby's a good man, Red.

225
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,131
Shouldn't have this be
the only thing he thinks about,

226
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:46,061
last months left to him.

227
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,211
Last months what?

228
00:18:53,290 --> 00:18:54,177
Oh, you...

229
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,897
you didn't know?

230
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,050
Yeah, pancre... pancreatic.

231
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,213
I'm up next.
You old ladies quit yakking.

232
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,134
- Rude.
- Hey, Mildred.

233
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,170
I saw you on TV the other day.

234
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,900
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, you looked good.

235
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,090
I mean, you know,
you came across really good

236
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,930
in the things
that you were saying.

237
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,130
I didn't think
you came across real good.

238
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,490
I think you sounded...
You came across as a stupid-ass.

239
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:22,690
Ain't it about time you got home
to your momma, Dixon?

240
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:26,770
No, it ain't time I go home
to my mama... momma.

241
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:30,138
I told her I was gonna be out
till 12:00, actually.

242
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:31,812
Jesus.

243
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,050
That's me versus you, Mildred.

244
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,890
Hey, Robbie. I think
that midget wants to get in my pants.

245
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:46,654
Father Montgomery.

246
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:52,652
Mildred. I'm... I'm sorry to be calling
on you so late, but...

247
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:56,739
I must say, Robbie has been
the consummate host.

248
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:00,890
Despite his having had,
as he was just telling me,

249
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,018
somewhat of a tricky day at school.

250
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,090
Oh, no. Just some of the guys
on the team was giving me crap.

251
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:07,210
Crap about what?

252
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,497
About the billboards, Mildred.

253
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,170
Which is what I've come
to have a word with you about.

254
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,252
Proceed.

255
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:17,495
I know how hard
it's been for you, Mildred,

256
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,220
this past year. We all do.

257
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:22,614
And if there is
ever anything that you need,

258
00:20:23,010 --> 00:20:25,331
we will be there for you. Always.

259
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:28,054
But the town also knows

260
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:30,935
what kind of a man
William Willoughby is.

261
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,134
And the town is dead set
against these billboards of yours.

262
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:37,810
Took a poll, did you, Father?

263
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:40,894
You know, Mildred,
if you hadn't stopped coming to church,

264
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:44,130
you'd have a little bit more understanding

265
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:46,019
of the depth of people's feelings.

266
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:49,414
I had more than a dozen people
come up to me on Sunday.

267
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,218
So, yes, I took a poll.

268
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:56,932
Everybody is with you about Angela.

269
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,978
Nobody is with you about this.

270
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:07,613
You know what I was thinking about today?

271
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,170
I was thinking about those street gangs

272
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,730
they have down in Los Angeles,

273
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,653
those Crips and those Bloods.

274
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,410
And I was thinking
about that bunch of new laws

275
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:19,610
they came up with
in the 1980s, I think it was,

276
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,137
to combat those street gangs,
those Crips and those Bloods.

277
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,737
And, if I remember rightly, the gist
of what those new laws were saying was,

278
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,215
if you join one of these gangs,
and you're running with them,

279
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,090
and down the block one night,
unbeknownst to you,

280
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,490
one of your fellow Crips,
or your fellow Bloods,

281
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:40,141
shoot up a place, or stab a guy...

282
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:44,211
well then, even though
you may not know nothing about it

283
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,370
and even though you may have
just been standing on a street corner,

284
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,895
minding your own business...

285
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:53,656
What these new laws said was
you're still culpable.

286
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,850
You're still culpable
by the very act of having joined

287
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,898
those Crips and those Bloods
in the first place.

288
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,694
Which got me thinking, Father...

289
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:04,050
that whole type of situation

290
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,212
is kinda like you church boys, ain't it?

291
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,690
You got your colors,
you got your clubhouse.

292
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,819
You're, for want
of a better word, a gang.

293
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:17,295
And if you were upstairs
smoking a pipe and reading your Bible...

294
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,690
while one
of your fellow gang members

295
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,772
is downstairs fucking
an altar boy, well...

296
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,930
Father, just like those Crips,
and just like those Bloods,

297
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:26,897
you're culpable...

298
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,692
'cause you joined the gang, man.

299
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,330
I don't care if you never did shit,

300
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:34,458
you never saw shit,
you never heard shit.

301
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:37,814
You join the gang,
you're culpable.

302
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:42,130
And when a person is culpable
to altar-boy-fucking,

303
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,490
or any kinda boy-fucking,

304
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,937
'cause I know you guys didn't
really narrow that down...

305
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:49,890
then you kinda forfeit the right
to come into my house

306
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:52,770
and say anything about me or my life,

307
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:54,978
or my daughter, or my billboards.

308
00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:00,970
So why don't you just finish up
your tea there, Father,

309
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,700
and get the fuck
outta my kitchen.

310
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,654
But thanks for coming up anyway, Father.

311
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,415
How you been feeling, Bill?

312
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,417
Like I got cancer in a major organ.

313
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:31,090
Well, I just want you to know
we're all on your side

314
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,740
about this Mildred Hayes thing.

315
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,499
If I have to hear that
one more fucking time...

316
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:42,179
I'm done with this shit.
I can't waste my life waiting.

317
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,370
Stop reading fucking comic books

318
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:49,418
and get me the file
on the Hayes case.

319
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:52,450
Angela Hayes case
or the Mildred Hayes case?

320
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,650
There is no Mildred Hayes case.

321
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:56,290
We've had two official complaints

322
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:58,020
about those billboards, so, actually...

323
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,097
From who?

324
00:24:03,090 --> 00:24:04,819
There's a lady with a funny eye...

325
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,410
and a fat dentist.

326
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,333
Get me the file
on the Angela Hayes case.

327
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,701
"A lady with a funny fucking eye"?

328
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:17,810
Jesus Christ.

329
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,137
Late night?

330
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,332
No.

331
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,774
Lay off that Welby guy, will you?

332
00:24:40,370 --> 00:24:41,337
Or you'll do what?

333
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:44,210
Kick your momma's
fucking teeth in.

334
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,940
No, you won't.

335
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:50,692
Who told you I was laying
on him anyway? The midget?

336
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,894
What the fuck are you talking about?

337
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:55,810
And I'm trying to fucking concentrate.

338
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,891
Fucking midgets!

339
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,256
What you looking for anyway?

340
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,250
There's nothing to look for.

341
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,890
I don't know what it is.

342
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,140
It feels like
it's kinda waggling.

343
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:38,500
Well, if it's waggling,
it's gonna have to come out.

344
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,374
Ain't you gonna
take a look at it first?

345
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:46,901
It's gonna have to come out.

346
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,736
Can I get a little Novocaine there, Doc?

347
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,095
Give it a couple of minutes.

348
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:29,930
I just wanted to say
there's a lot of good friends

349
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:31,570
of Bill Willoughby in this town,
Miss Hayes.

350
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,652
No! Stop! No!

351
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,616
God damn it!

352
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,490
Then why don't you tell
those good friends of Bill Willoughby

353
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:50,221
to tell him to go
do his fucking job, fat boy.

354
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,176
Hey there, Mildred.

355
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,530
You didn't happen to pay a visit

356
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:09,690
to the dentist today, did you?

357
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,534
- No.
- Huh?

358
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,657
I said, "No."

359
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:16,650
Oh, so it wasn't you
who drilled a little hole

360
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:20,530
in one of big fat Geoffrey's
big fat thumbnails, no?

361
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:22,730
- Of course not.
- Huh?

362
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,699
I said, "Of course not."

363
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,694
You drilled a hole in the dentist?

364
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,290
Denise, no, I didn't.

365
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,657
I thought
it was kinda funny myself, but...

366
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,050
he wants to press charges,

367
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,576
so we're gonna have
to bring you in, I'm afraid.

368
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:59,934
So how's it all going
in the nigger-torturing business, Dixon?

369
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:03,533
It's persons-of-color-torturing business,
these days.

370
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,097
If you wanna know...

371
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,296
I didn't torture nobody.

372
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:12,571
What's the matter with you,
saying that goddamn stuff on TV?

373
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,700
My momma watches that station.

374
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,570
Your momma doesn't know
about the torturing?

375
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:19,170
No, she doesn't know anything about it.
She's against that kinda thing.

376
00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:20,330
Who's against what?

377
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,250
My mama... momma is against
persons-of-color-torturing.

378
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:24,730
She said, "Nigger-torturing."

379
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,890
I said, "You can't say
'nigger-torturing' no more."

380
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,734
"You gotta say
persons-of-color-torturing."

381
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,610
Isn't that right, Chief?

382
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:32,132
Ain't that right?

383
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,930
I think I'll be able
to take care of Mrs. Hayes

384
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,774
on my own from here on, Jason.

385
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,539
Sure, Chief. I'll be right outside.

386
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,055
Don't give me that look.

387
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:06,410
If you got rid of every cop
with vaguely racist leanings,

388
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,890
you'd have... three cops left,

389
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,210
and all of them
are gonna hate the fags.

390
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,894
So what are you gonna do,
you know?

391
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:17,301
I wanna know something, Mildred.

392
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,410
Why'd you drill a hole

393
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,410
through poor fat Geoffrey's thumbnail?

394
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,821
That did not happen.

395
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,657
His hand slipped.

396
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,814
He drilled a hole
through his own self.

397
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:29,856
Did he say I did it?

398
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,134
I guess
it's his word against mine, then, huh?

399
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,258
Kinda like in all those rape cases
you hear about.

400
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:39,970
Except, this time,
the chick ain't losing.

401
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:43,213
It ain't really about winning
or losing, though, is it, Mildred?

402
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,334
You think I care about who wins or loses
between the two of youse?

403
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,574
You think I care about dentists?

404
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,780
I don't care about dentists.

405
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:55,258
Nobody cares about dentists.

406
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:59,015
What I do care about, or what I'm...

407
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:01,456
interested in...

408
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,415
is tying you up in court so long

409
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:09,815
that your hours at the gift shop
be so shot to shit

410
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,890
that you ain't gonna have a penny

411
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:14,257
to pay for another month's billboards.

412
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,970
- I got some dough put...
- That's what I'm interested in.

413
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,336
I got some dough put away.

414
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:23,490
But what I heard was you had to sell off
your ex-husband's tractor-trailer

415
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:26,096
to even pay for this month's
billboards, that right?

416
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,979
How is old Charlie, by the way?

417
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,850
He still shacked up with that pretty
little intern works down at the zoo?

418
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,456
He's still shacked up
with some chick smells of shit.

419
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,010
I don't know if the Zoo's
got anything to do with it.

420
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,934
Although I'd hope so.

421
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,090
How old is she? Nineteen?

422
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:48,690
That must smart.

423
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:52,536
Keep trying. Keep trying.

424
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:55,770
What's Charlie think about
these here billboards of yours,

425
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,570
an ex-cop like Charlie?

426
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:00,290
Ex-cop, ex-wife-beater.
Same difference, I guess, right?

427
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:02,941
His word against yours,
though, right?

428
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,690
Charlie don't know about 'em, does he?

429
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,890
It's none of his business.

430
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,770
Well, he's kinda paying for 'em,
though, ain't he?

431
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,250
- I'm paying for 'em!
- This month you are.

432
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:14,934
How about when...

433
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:22,539
- I... I didn't mean to...
- I know.

434
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,052
- It was an accident.
- I know, baby.

435
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,097
It's blood.

436
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,336
I'm gonna go get somebody.

437
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,455
Hey!

438
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:38,131
- Just let her go.
- Come on, Chief.

439
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,935
Just let her go!

440
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:45,690
Easy, easy, easy.

441
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,331
Hey.

442
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,576
- Do birds get cancer?
- Huh?

443
00:32:15,690 --> 00:32:20,090
- Birds. Do they get cancer?
- I don't know. Dogs do.

444
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,140
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dogs, was I?

445
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:33,050
Great, the good old
"Raped While Dying" route home.

446
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,810
'Cause if there was two seconds in a day

447
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,130
when I wasn't thinking about her
and I wasn't thinking about how she died,

448
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:40,611
"There you go! Think about it
some more, why don't you?"

449
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,650
It's good too, that as much
as a person might have tried

450
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,970
to avoid the details of what happened

451
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:47,850
'cause he didn't think
it would do any good,

452
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,773
and he didn't think he could bear it...

453
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:51,770
it's also good to be informed

454
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:53,890
in 20-foot-high font
and in real nice lettering

455
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,019
the precise details of her last moments.

456
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,898
That it wasn't enough that she was raped

457
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:03,050
and it wasn't enough that she died, no.

458
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,174
"Raped While Dying."

459
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:07,456
Thank you, Mom.

460
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,490
I gave you the police reports.

461
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,810
I didn't read 'em.

462
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:16,536
I'm depressed enough as it fucking is.

463
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:58,531
Mom?

464
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,897
Yeah?

465
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:02,250
You ain't going out
again tonight, are ya?

466
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,492
Denise and I are gonna
grab a couple of beers, yeah.

467
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,890
Denise gonna be driving you?

468
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,490
Angela, Why don't you just ask me
if you can borrow the car?

469
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,530
- Can I borrow the car?
- No.

470
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,730
- Bitch!
- I will give you money for a taxi

471
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,410
if you ask me nice
and don't call me a bitch.

472
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:17,650
Why'd you make me ask you
if you was never gonna let me borrow it?

473
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:20,370
'Cause it was funny! And because
you've been smoking pot all day.

474
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:22,410
- You are such a hypocrite.
- Hypocrite?

475
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,930
- Yeah.
- How?

476
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,090
You drove drunk with us
in the car when we were kids.

477
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,696
- What are you talking about?
- Daddy told me.

478
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:31,737
- When'd you see him?
- Don't change the subject.

479
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:35,130
Did you or did you not drive drunk with us
in the car when we were kids?

480
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,410
- Once, maybe.
- Okay, once?

481
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,370
When he was in the middle
of beating the shit out of me.

482
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:42,533
- Which we've only got your word about!
- Angela, for Christ sakes.

483
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,330
Why are you never on my side, Robbie?

484
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,290
I'm always on your side
when you're not being a cunt!

485
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,210
- Hey!
- There will be no more "cunts"

486
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:50,890
- in this house. You got that, mister?
- What, are you moving out?

487
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,774
It was a Ga...
It's a Ga... it was a gag.

488
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,410
Are you gonna let me
borrow the car or what?

489
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,570
Why don't you just walk, Angela?
Why don't you just walk?

490
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:01,493
You know what? I will walk.

491
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,210
I will walk! And you know what else?

492
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,090
- I hope I get raped on the way!
- Yeah, well, I hope

493
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,695
you get raped on the way too!

494
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,492
We're gonna need to keep you
in a few days, Bill.

495
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:27,415
You shouldn't be
coughing up blood.

496
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:30,577
Yeah. Kinda guessed that, Doc.

497
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,851
I'll swing by in the morning.

498
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:34,577
Anne.

499
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,054
I guess I'll go
get your coat, huh?

500
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,850
Well, you know I ain't staying.

501
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,456
You know I ain't arguing.

502
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,657
Oops.

503
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,816
You old cunt.

504
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,455
I'm not old, Robbie.

505
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,060
That's Dad.

506
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,781
Hey, Dad. How's it going?

507
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,576
Where's the crazy lady?

508
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,012
Kid's got Rice fucking Krispies
in his fucking hair.

509
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,090
What's going on around here?

510
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:12,770
And What the fuck is going on
with these fucking billboards, Mildred?

511
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,330
Kinda self-explanatory.

512
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,219
Well, why don't you just explain it to me?

513
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,292
Guess it ain't self-explanatory, then.

514
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:23,410
Well, you know, I guess
I wanted certain people's minds

515
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,379
kept on certain people's jobs, is all.

516
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,017
I hadn't heard from them
in seven goddamn months.

517
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,370
I tell you this,
I've heard an awful lot from them

518
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:32,050
since I put them billboards up.

519
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:34,417
You think this has focused
their minds?

520
00:37:34,530 --> 00:37:36,130
I'll tell you what
it's focused their minds on.

521
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:39,170
It's focused their minds on
how exactly are they gonna fuck you up.

522
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:41,410
The more you keep a case
in the public eye,

523
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,413
the better your chances
are of getting it solved.

524
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,859
It's in all the guidebooks, Charlie.

525
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,650
How much these billboards cost?

526
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,300
About the same
as a tractor-trailer.

527
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,770
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

528
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:55,421
Laughed at by a guy
with fucking cereal in his hair.

529
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:58,859
- How's Penelope?
- Huh? She's all right.

530
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:00,130
Why don't you invite her in?

531
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,570
Save leaving her sitting out there.

532
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:03,732
- She here?
- She's out in the car.

533
00:38:03,850 --> 00:38:05,215
Oh, that explains it.

534
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:09,097
- That explains what?
- I know I smelt something.

535
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,930
Let her go!

536
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:16,610
Um, I kinda need
to use the bathroom,

537
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:19,130
but if it's inconvenient...
Actually, it is inconvenient, isn't it?

538
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,170
I can see it's inconvenient.
I can hold it. It's all right.

539
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,650
It's the first door down the hall.

540
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:24,930
Are you sure?
I feel like I'm... intruding.

541
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,853
Just go pee.

542
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:47,890
Look, you said what you came to say,

543
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,250
so why don't you go get zoo girl

544
00:38:49,330 --> 00:38:51,090
and get the hell
out of my house, all right?

545
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:54,930
Um, actually, zoo-wise, they were
letting people go at the zoo,

546
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:58,130
unfortunately, and it was a case
of "last in, first out,"

547
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,570
so yeah, unfortunately,
the zoo had to let me go.

548
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,130
But they were looking for people down
at the horse rides for the disableds

549
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,700
to look after the horses down there.

550
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,134
So I'm working down there now,
looking after the disableds' horses.

551
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,494
- Don't say a word.
- I wasn't gonna say a word.

552
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:25,690
You don't think I don't wish
it had never happened?

553
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,339
You don't think I don't wish
she was still here?

554
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,811
I know you do.

555
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,131
I know you do.

556
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:42,011
Billboards ain't gonna
bring her back, Mildred.

557
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:46,214
Neither is fucking 19-year-olds, Charlie.

558
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,052
Yeah?

559
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:51,415
But I know that.

560
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,691
Just go.

561
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:57,616
Yeah, all right.

562
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:01,974
I'm such a shitty dad,
and you're such a great mom. All right.

563
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:06,410
So how come a week before she died

564
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:09,300
she comes around asking if she can
move in with me at my place?

565
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,930
'Cause she couldn't stand the two of you
bitching at each other no more,

566
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,010
- fighting with each other no more.
- I don't believe you.

567
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:16,130
And I said, "No. Stay at home.
Your mom loves you."

568
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,012
Now I wish I hadn't.

569
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:22,290
'Cause if I hadn't,
she'd still fucking be here.

570
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,490
I don't believe you!

571
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,617
Don't believe me.

572
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,131
Ask Froot Loop boy.

573
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:39,257
Is that true?

574
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,295
I don't know, Mom.

575
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,336
Yeah, you do.

576
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,051
What's the matter?

577
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,730
Nothing.

578
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,930
Oh, come on,
not Donald Sutherland again.

579
00:41:01,010 --> 00:41:03,217
What is this, frickin'
Donald Sutherland season?

580
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,730
I like him. I like his hair.

581
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:06,732
Hair?

582
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:10,651
This is the one
where his little girl dies.

583
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,977
Always a plus in a movie.

584
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,261
Talking of dead kids,

585
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,770
what's happening with the billboard lady?

586
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:20,217
Oh, that kooz won't listen to reason.

587
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:22,576
She's tough as an old boot.

588
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:27,136
Why don't you just fuck her over
through her friends then?

589
00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:30,090
Huh?

590
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:32,332
You know, why don't you
fuck her friends over?

591
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:34,095
Bring her around that way.

592
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,457
She got any friends you can fuck over?

593
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,175
Rat bastards.

594
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,690
- Hey, fuckhead!
- What?

595
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,450
Don't say, "What," Dixon,
when she comes in calling you a fuckhead!

596
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:10,170
- And don't you come in here...
- Shut up!

597
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:12,650
You, get over here.

598
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,970
No! You, get over here.

599
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,530
- All right.
- What? Don't! Dixon!

600
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,330
- What?
- You do not allow a member of the public

601
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,210
to call you a fuckhead
in the station house!

602
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,970
That's what I'm doing!
I'm taking care of it

603
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:27,570
in my own way, actually.
Now get out of my ass.

604
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:30,650
Mrs. Hayes, have a seat.
What is it I can do for you today?

605
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:33,690
- Where's Denise Watson?
- Denise Watson's in the clanger.

606
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:35,454
- On what charge?
- Possession.

607
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,450
- Of what?
- Two marijuana cigarettes.

608
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:39,417
Big ones.

609
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:43,419
- When's the bail hearing?
- I asked the judge not to give her bail

610
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:46,450
on account of her previous
marijuana violations,

611
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:47,850
and the judge said, "Sure."

612
00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:48,977
You fucking prick!

613
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:55,730
You do not call an officer
of the law a fucking prick

614
00:42:55,850 --> 00:42:58,012
in his own station house,
Mrs. Hayes.

615
00:42:58,330 --> 00:42:59,661
Or anywhere, actually.

616
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:02,974
What's with the new attitude, Dixon?

617
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,414
Your momma been coaching ya?

618
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,172
No.

619
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,012
My momma...

620
00:43:10,770 --> 00:43:11,692
doesn't do that.

621
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,578
Take them down, you hear me?

622
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:20,054
You did good, Dixon.

623
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:22,014
Yeah, I know I did.

624
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,616
Almost got that.

625
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:29,772
The rules here are twofold.

626
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:33,570
No kid can leave
this goddamn blanket

627
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:35,652
at any goddamn time.

628
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:38,010
And every single one

629
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,730
of these dolls
and these teddy bears

630
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:42,972
has got to be hooked up.

631
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:44,820
Now, your momma and I,

632
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,450
although it won't look like it,

633
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:49,693
we'll be watching every
goddamn move you make.

634
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:53,255
So the most important thing
while we are watching you

635
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:57,256
is that you do not
leave this blanket.

636
00:43:58,130 --> 00:44:02,772
Next most important thing,
you do not at any stage

637
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:05,250
allow the fishing rods

638
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:08,650
to stick into you
or your sister's eyeballs,

639
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,530
as this would be
counter-productive

640
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:13,931
to the entire operation.

641
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,211
What would it be?

642
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,610
Counter-productive
to the entire operation.

643
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:21,657
Then, troops...

644
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:26,776
start fishing.

645
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,615
We are not.

646
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:33,092
We are.

647
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:36,691
Yes.

648
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:39,097
Yes.

649
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:43,537
Yes.

650
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,140
Hey, baby.

651
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,059
Yup, still no arrests.

652
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,016
How come, I wonder?

653
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,690
Because there ain't no God,
the whole world's empty,

654
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,610
and it doesn't matter
what we do to each other?

655
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:40,896
I hope not.

656
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:50,333
How come you came up here
outta nowhere looking so pretty?

657
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:55,530
You ain't trying to make me believe
in reincarnation or something, are ya?

658
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,698
'Cause you're pretty, but you ain't her.

659
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,891
She got killed...

660
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:04,460
and now she's dead forever.

661
00:46:07,810 --> 00:46:09,380
I do thank you
for coming though.

662
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:13,618
If I had some food
I'd give it to you.

663
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,370
All I got is some Doritos,

664
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:17,373
and they might kill you.
They're kind of pointy.

665
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:19,856
Then where would we be?

666
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,730
Yeah, so I,
just happened to be looking

667
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,610
over our contract
that we drew up back that time.

668
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:45,260
What I realized was I...

669
00:46:45,890 --> 00:46:48,734
I realized that
although payment is to be made

670
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,610
on the first day of each month,

671
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:53,819
the first payment you paid
was actually a deposit.

672
00:46:54,690 --> 00:46:56,130
Wasn't it? It's like we said.

673
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:57,810
So, actually, in point of fact,

674
00:46:57,890 --> 00:47:00,610
you're actually behind
in your payments now,

675
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,499
by, yeah, a month.

676
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:04,461
Yeah, that's...

677
00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:08,053
It's what the contract says,
looking over it and all.

678
00:47:09,450 --> 00:47:11,179
Lawyer says so too.

679
00:47:12,290 --> 00:47:14,213
When you need this next payment by, Red?

680
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:17,856
Well, now, really.

681
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,851
Or by...

682
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,973
Friday?

683
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:30,450
When you can't trust the lawyers
and the advertising men,

684
00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:32,339
what the hell's America coming to, huh?

685
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:34,296
Who got to you, Red?

686
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:35,857
Willoughby?

687
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,535
- Nobody got to me.
- My fat fucking ass.

688
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:45,293
- He's dying, Mildred.
- We're all fucking dying!

689
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:48,090
- Red!
- Hi, Pamela. We're a little bit busy

690
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,210
- at the moment, if that's okay.
- Red. Oh, Red, I know...

691
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:52,690
I know you were real anxious
about talking to Mrs. Hayes this morning.

692
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:54,050
Anxious? No.

693
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:57,130
No, but that's the thing. There's no need
to be, because you won't believe it!

694
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:59,656
Little Mexican delivery boy
just dropped in with this.

695
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,090
- What the hell is this?
- I know!

696
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:05,094
It's $5,000!
And guess what the note says?

697
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,730
It says to pay for the rental
on Mrs. Hayes's billboards.

698
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:11,010
Can you believe it?
That's why I butted in.

699
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,457
- Well, who's it from?
- Well, doesn't say.

700
00:48:13,810 --> 00:48:15,096
Well, where's the delivery boy?

701
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,018
Well, he went.

702
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,859
Well, did you see
what company he was from?

703
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:21,461
- Well, no.
- What kind of uniform did he have on?

704
00:48:22,130 --> 00:48:24,701
Well, he just looked like one
of those fat little Mexican boys.

705
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:26,892
On a bicycle.

706
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,890
- Did I do something wrong?
- No, no, Pam, you did good.

707
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:35,018
Yeah, Pamela, you did real good.

708
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:36,974
Did I? Oh, great.

709
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,578
Ain't life crazy?

710
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:46,091
What's the note say, Red?

711
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:52,490
Says here, "This here money is
to go towards the fund"

712
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:54,210
"for Mildred Hayes's billboards,"

713
00:48:54,290 --> 00:48:56,210
"'cause she ain't
the only one 'round here"

714
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:58,338
"who hates the pigs.
Signed, a friend."

715
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:01,890
I guess you can't be too picky about who
your friends are these days, huh?

716
00:49:05,090 --> 00:49:07,457
I guess I'll be needing
a receipt off you there, Red,

717
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:09,370
you know, saying the price of next month

718
00:49:09,450 --> 00:49:10,611
is paid in full and all.

719
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:13,255
Oh, sure, Mildred, sure.

720
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,618
- Like now.
- Oh, sure.

721
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:22,535
Is Mommy drunk, Daddy?

722
00:49:22,970 --> 00:49:25,530
No, no. She's just got
a little migraine, is all.

723
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:27,851
Little... Chardonnay migraine.

724
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:30,821
Now, no more chit-chat
outta you two, okay?

725
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:33,937
Can we stay home from school
again tomorrow, Daddy?

726
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,461
We'll see what your mommy
says in the morning, darling.

727
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:40,894
Eyes closed...

728
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:44,132
and go to sleep, okay?

729
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:00,699
You don't smell like puke,
which is good.

730
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:03,657
Aquafresh. Trick I learned.

731
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,541
Women, huh?

732
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:09,850
But it's still your turn
to clean the horseshit

733
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,261
outta the stable, you know.

734
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:13,259
Those fucking horses.

735
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:15,890
They're your fucking horses.

736
00:50:15,970 --> 00:50:17,859
I'm gonna have those
fucking horses shot!

737
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:22,259
I'll do it...
you lazy bitch.

738
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:25,098
Thank you, Poppa.

739
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,175
That was a real nice day.

740
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:33,379
That was a real nice fuck.

741
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:39,179
You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby.

742
00:50:43,890 --> 00:50:45,494
Is that from a play?

743
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:48,090
"You got a real nice cock,
Mr. Willoughby."

744
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:51,770
I think I heard that
in a Shakespeare one time.

745
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:52,931
You dummy.

746
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,420
It's Oscar Wilde.

747
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,934
Oscar Wilde.

748
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,095
My darling Anne,

749
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:25,570
there's a longer letter
in the dresser drawer

750
00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:27,732
I've been writing
for the last week or so.

751
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,293
That one covers us
and my memories of us

752
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,460
and how much I've always loved you.

753
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,777
This one just covers tonight,
and more importantly, today.

754
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,650
Tonight I've gone out
to the horses to end it.

755
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,691
I cannot say sorry for the act itself,

756
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:46,650
although I know that for a short time

757
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,810
you will be angry at me
or even hate me for it.

758
00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:51,176
Please don't.

759
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,770
This is not a case of,
"I came in this world alone"

760
00:52:54,850 --> 00:52:56,170
"and I'm going out of it alone,"

761
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,775
or anything dumb like that.

762
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:00,690
I did not come in this world alone,

763
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:01,851
my mom was there.

764
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:04,613
And I am not going out of it alone,

765
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,377
'cause you are there,

766
00:53:06,650 --> 00:53:10,371
drunk on the couch,
making Oscar Wilde cock jokes.

767
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:14,573
No, this is a case,
in some senses, of bravery.

768
00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:17,377
Not the bravery
of facing a bullet down.

769
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:19,090
The next few months of pain

770
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:21,855
would be far harder
than that small flash.

771
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:24,770
No, it's the bravery
of weighing up

772
00:53:24,850 --> 00:53:27,376
the next few months
of still being with you...

773
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:31,413
still waking up with you,
of playing with the kids...

774
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,850
against the next few months
of seeing in your eyes

775
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:37,331
how much my pain is killing you,

776
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:40,210
how my weakened body,
as it ebbs away,

777
00:53:40,290 --> 00:53:41,655
and you tend to it,

778
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:44,696
are your final and lasting memories of me.

779
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:46,971
I won't have that.

780
00:53:48,370 --> 00:53:51,570
Your final memories of me
will be us at the riverside

781
00:53:51,650 --> 00:53:54,893
and that dumb fishing game,
which I think they cheated at...

782
00:53:55,650 --> 00:53:58,540
and me inside of you
and you on top of me...

783
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:03,216
and barely a fleeting thought
of the darkness yet to come.

784
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,661
That was the best, Anne.

785
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,530
A whole day of not thinking about it.

786
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,090
Dwell on this day, baby,

787
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:13,332
'cause it was the best day of my life.

788
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:15,861
Kiss the girls for me,

789
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,740
and know that I've always loved you,

790
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,615
and maybe I'll see you again
if there's another place.

791
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,577
And if there ain't, well,
it's been heaven knowing you.

792
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:27,977
Your boy...

793
00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:30,817
Bill.

794
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,138
What the hell's going on around here?

795
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:34,332
What?

796
00:56:03,010 --> 00:56:04,011
Can you stand now?

797
00:56:05,530 --> 00:56:06,861
Yeah, I can stand.

798
00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:11,941
I'd better get out there...

799
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,450
say something to 'em.

800
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,415
You ain't gonna faint again, are ya?

801
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,456
I know that the best thing...

802
00:56:49,530 --> 00:56:53,490
the only thing to honor
that man's memory right now

803
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:55,060
is to go to work...

804
00:56:55,930 --> 00:56:56,931
is to be a...

805
00:56:58,050 --> 00:56:58,937
a good cop...

806
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,294
to walk in his shoes...

807
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,258
and do what he did
every day of his life.

808
00:57:06,810 --> 00:57:07,732
Help people.

809
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,335
What the hell's going on?

810
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,057
Where are you going, boy?

811
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:09,372
You fucking pig!
What the fuck are you...

812
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,541
Shut up.

813
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:35,933
See, Red, I got issues
with white folks too.

814
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,296
Fuck you looking at?

815
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,290
Reports, sadly, have come in overnight,

816
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,850
that Chief William Willoughby
of Ebbing, Missouri,

817
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:05,210
took his own life
early this morning

818
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:06,730
in the grounds of his home.

819
00:59:06,810 --> 00:59:09,541
This report just in
from Gabriella Forrester.

820
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:11,210
Tragedy came calling today

821
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,570
upon this quiet family home
outside Ebbing, Missouri.

822
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:17,017
A home belonging
to Chief William Willoughby,

823
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:20,459
his wife, Anne, their two
young daughters, Polly and Jane.

824
00:59:21,450 --> 00:59:23,730
What appears to be
a self-inflicted gunshot wound

825
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,972
brought life to an end
for Chief Willoughby,

826
00:59:26,290 --> 00:59:28,130
a man highly-respected in Ebbing

827
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:30,781
for his diligence
and service to the community.

828
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:32,730
What led him to take his life

829
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:34,490
in the early hours of this morning,

830
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,459
it is too early to speculate.

831
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:38,096
There were rumors of illness.

832
00:59:38,410 --> 00:59:40,410
Could it simply have been
the pressures of the job?

833
00:59:40,850 --> 00:59:43,137
Or could it have something
to do with a story

834
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,776
we ran here just two weeks ago

835
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,380
of these billboards and the woman
who put them there, Mildred Hayes?

836
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,696
Don't. Don't!

837
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,452
Hi, there.

838
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:16,057
- You know who threw that can?
- What can?

839
01:00:19,250 --> 01:00:21,410
How about you, sweetheart?
You know who threw that can?

840
01:00:21,490 --> 01:00:23,777
No, I didn't really...

841
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,617
Thank you, Mom.

842
01:00:45,730 --> 01:00:48,130
And what can I do for you today, sir?

843
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:49,291
What's your name?

844
01:00:51,490 --> 01:00:54,539
Name's on my tag, man.
You hard of reading?

845
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:57,410
Hard of reading? No, no.

846
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:58,690
That's good, "hard of reading."

847
01:00:58,770 --> 01:00:59,931
Kinda like "hard of hearing,"

848
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,179
but it's actually "hard of reading."

849
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,330
Like a play on words
or something, huh?

850
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:07,210
What do you want?

851
01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:09,372
I've been sent down to take over from...

852
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:12,770
Chief Willoughby in light
of last night's unfortunate event.

853
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,581
You have got to be
fucking kidding me!

854
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:20,973
Do you have
any documentation to prove that, sir?

855
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:24,650
You really wanna see
my documentation, fucker?

856
01:01:24,730 --> 01:01:28,530
Yeah, see his documentation!
Make him show it to you.

857
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,131
None of you cracker motherfuckers
got no work to do?

858
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:38,012
Ain't that racist?

859
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:45,612
What happened to your hand,
Officer Dixon?

860
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:46,931
Oh, I just kinda...

861
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,450
banged it up a little bit

862
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,890
while I was throwing some guy
out a fucking window.

863
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:54,621
- You know, the usual.
- Oh yeah?

864
01:01:55,210 --> 01:01:57,372
They never taught me
that one at the academy.

865
01:01:57,570 --> 01:01:59,811
Which fucking academy you go to?

866
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,615
How are things
coming along on that Angela Hayes case?

867
01:02:05,450 --> 01:02:08,290
How's things coming along on
the mind-your-own-fucking-business case?

868
01:02:08,370 --> 01:02:09,490
How are things coming along

869
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:11,937
on the hand me your gun and your badge?

870
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:16,490
What? Huh?

871
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:19,414
Hand me your gun and your badge.

872
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:40,171
Shit.

873
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:55,450
In here somewhere.

874
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:05,133
Hey, listen, I can't find my badge.

875
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,655
No, seriously. Maybe I lost it.

876
01:03:07,770 --> 01:03:10,170
You know, dropped it
when I was doing that window guy.

877
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:13,015
Just get the fuck
out of my station house, man.

878
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:39,859
What's going on?

879
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:42,097
I think I...

880
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,261
I think I just got fired.

881
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:47,810
Fired or suspended,
I'm not sure which.

882
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:48,891
Fired.

883
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:21,890
Anything I can help you with,
just give me a holler.

884
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:28,140
Give Mildred Hayes...

885
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:30,291
a holler.

886
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:33,692
Okay.

887
01:04:35,570 --> 01:04:36,492
You know me?

888
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:39,860
Only from the TV... and the radio.

889
01:04:48,330 --> 01:04:50,901
How much these here
"Welcome to Missouri" rabbits go for?

890
01:04:51,850 --> 01:04:52,692
Seven bucks.

891
01:04:53,250 --> 01:04:54,331
It's writ right on them.

892
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:03,980
Guess he ain't seven bucks now.

893
01:05:06,610 --> 01:05:07,941
What you come in here for?

894
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:09,496
What I come in here for?

895
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:13,370
Well, maybe I'm a good friend
of Willoughby's. How about that?

896
01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:15,252
Are you?

897
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,057
Or, you know...

898
01:05:19,770 --> 01:05:21,770
Maybe I was a friend of
your daughter or something.

899
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:24,257
How about that?

900
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:28,017
Were you?

901
01:05:31,450 --> 01:05:32,531
Or...

902
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,330
You know, maybe I was the one

903
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:37,821
who fucked her
while she was dying.

904
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,136
How about that?

905
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:44,451
Were you?

906
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:47,811
No.

907
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:50,651
I would have liked to.

908
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,181
I saw her picture in the paper there.

909
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,258
Saved by the bell, huh?

910
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:03,097
You owe me seven fucking
dollars for the rabbit.

911
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:07,610
Guess you'll have to get it off me next
time I'm passing through, huh, Mildred?

912
01:06:07,690 --> 01:06:08,612
Guess I will.

913
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:20,537
You don't know how glad I am to see you.

914
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:23,652
- What?
- That guy was trying to scare me.

915
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:25,934
I wouldn't have said you scare easy.

916
01:06:26,570 --> 01:06:27,617
I ain't the worst.

917
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:30,981
What can I do for you, ma'am?

918
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:32,850
My husband left this for you

919
01:06:32,930 --> 01:06:35,092
before he shot himself
in the head last night.

920
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:41,579
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Willoughby. I...
- Are you?

921
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:44,890
- Are you really?
- Sure, I am.

922
01:06:44,970 --> 01:06:47,291
Well, surely this is
the perfect ending for you, isn't it?

923
01:06:47,690 --> 01:06:51,130
It's proof that they were successful,
those billboards of yours,

924
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,655
isn't it? A dead policeman?

925
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:55,570
- It's quantifiable now.
- Are you blaming this on me?

926
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,572
No.

927
01:06:57,330 --> 01:06:58,610
I'm not blaming this on you.

928
01:06:58,690 --> 01:07:00,050
I just came
to give you the letter.

929
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:04,090
Now my little girls are out in the car,

930
01:07:04,170 --> 01:07:05,774
so I'd better not stay and chat.

931
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:10,370
I'm not quite sure what
we're gonna do for the rest of the day.

932
01:07:12,170 --> 01:07:14,250
It's hard to know what to do

933
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,697
the day your husband kills himself.

934
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:18,576
It's hard to know what to do.

935
01:07:48,850 --> 01:07:49,692
Dear Mildred...

936
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:52,095
Dead Man Willoughby here.

937
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:55,210
Firstly, I wanted to apologize for dying

938
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,292
without catching your daughter's killer.

939
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,570
It's a source of great pain to me,

940
01:07:59,650 --> 01:08:01,170
and it would break my heart to think

941
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,935
you thought I didn't care,
'cause I did care.

942
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,541
There are just some cases...

943
01:08:07,130 --> 01:08:08,700
where you never catch a break...

944
01:08:09,530 --> 01:08:11,250
then five years down the line

945
01:08:11,330 --> 01:08:13,450
some guy hears some other guy

946
01:08:13,530 --> 01:08:16,739
bragging about it
in a bar room or a jail cell

947
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:18,850
and the whole thing is wrapped up

948
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,455
through sheer stupidity.

949
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:23,780
I hope that might be true for Angela.
I really do.

950
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:27,175
Second, I gotta admit, Mildred,

951
01:08:27,290 --> 01:08:29,861
the billboards were a great fucking idea.

952
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:32,254
They were like a chess move.

953
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:34,690
And although they had absolutely nothing

954
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,135
to do with my dying...

955
01:08:36,730 --> 01:08:38,250
I'm sure that everyone in town

956
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:39,695
will assume that they did,

957
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:42,617
which is why,
for Willoughby's counter-move,

958
01:08:42,810 --> 01:08:45,336
I decided to pay
the next month's rent on 'em.

959
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:48,650
I thought it'd be funny,
you having to defend 'em

960
01:08:48,730 --> 01:08:51,813
a whole nother month
after they've stuck me in the ground.

961
01:08:52,930 --> 01:08:55,090
The joke is on you, Mildred,

962
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,138
and I hope they do not kill you.

963
01:08:58,570 --> 01:08:59,890
So good luck with all that,

964
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,938
and good luck with everything else too.

965
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:05,772
I hope and I pray that you get him.

966
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:26,814
Well, you want me
to go down and talk to 'em?

967
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:29,693
No, I don't want you
to go down and talk to 'em.

968
01:09:30,730 --> 01:09:32,090
Somebody sending their goddamn mother

969
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:33,774
down to talk to the goddamn police?

970
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,050
To say what?

971
01:09:39,130 --> 01:09:41,861
To say to give you
your job back.

972
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,580
Get rid of that black guy.

973
01:09:45,450 --> 01:09:46,850
Ain't gonna listen to some guy's mother

974
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:48,570
asking them to get rid of some black guy.

975
01:09:50,050 --> 01:09:51,650
Things have moved on in the South.

976
01:09:51,730 --> 01:09:52,936
Well, it shouldn't have!

977
01:09:55,210 --> 01:09:59,056
Will they give you some money
for being laid off and all?

978
01:10:00,890 --> 01:10:03,090
I don't know what
the compensation scheme is

979
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:05,013
for when you throw a guy
out of a window, Ma.

980
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:07,450
Guess I should have looked
into that beforehand.

981
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:08,577
Let me Google that.

982
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,414
A couple of grand, maybe?

983
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,894
You been there three years.

984
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,817
Not counting the five years
at the academy.

985
01:10:19,090 --> 01:10:19,977
Six...

986
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:22,692
if you count the year
you were held back.

987
01:10:25,370 --> 01:10:26,417
Where are you going?

988
01:10:27,530 --> 01:10:28,611
None of your business.

989
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:31,379
Off to see your fancy woman?

990
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:35,810
- I don't got a fancy woman.
- Yeah. I know.

991
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:38,530
Hey. You wanna watch yourself.

992
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:40,612
Or-or... or you'll do what?

993
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:46,776
I'll blow your goddamn head off,
that's what.

994
01:10:57,570 --> 01:10:58,690
Oh, did you hear the news?

995
01:10:58,770 --> 01:10:59,810
What news?

996
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:01,490
That Dixon guy threw that Welby guy

997
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,856
out of his window this morning.

998
01:11:03,850 --> 01:11:05,090
You're shitting me.

999
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:11,457
Is he okay?

1000
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,854
You're shitting me!

1001
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,814
Holy shit! Holy shit!

1002
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:24,981
Holy shit!

1003
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:27,211
Fuck!

1004
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:32,130
Go get the other one from the house.

1005
01:11:32,210 --> 01:11:33,970
Shouldn't I call the fire department?

1006
01:11:34,050 --> 01:11:36,451
Fuck the fire department.
They probably started it.

1007
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,810
Don't do anything stupid!

1008
01:11:39,490 --> 01:11:40,650
Scumbags!

1009
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,017
Fucking, fucking scumbags!

1010
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:17,770
Shit!

1011
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:19,295
All right!

1012
01:12:41,450 --> 01:12:42,781
Are you kidding me?

1013
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:49,892
Mom! What the hell are you doing?

1014
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:01,090
- Yeah. Okay. All right. Good. Come on.
- Leave it! Ma, please!

1015
01:13:01,170 --> 01:13:02,251
It's too late!

1016
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,450
- Robbie.
- Leave it! Please!

1017
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:08,531
Robbie!

1018
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:39,450
How are those hands?

1019
01:13:42,010 --> 01:13:43,694
Give us a minute here. Thank you.

1020
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:48,770
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

1021
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:51,010
Can ask me all the questions you want,

1022
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:52,330
you take me down and arrest me.

1023
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,530
I'm not gonna arrest you, Mrs. Hayes.

1024
01:13:54,610 --> 01:13:55,975
I got nothing to arrest you for.

1025
01:13:58,490 --> 01:13:59,730
Not yet you ain't.

1026
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:08,053
We ain't all the enemy, you know.

1027
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:29,736
I'll crucify the motherfuckers.

1028
01:14:41,290 --> 01:14:42,860
What are you gonna do, Mildred?

1029
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:44,450
You gonna crucify 'em?

1030
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:47,412
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify 'em.

1031
01:14:48,330 --> 01:14:49,695
Who you gonna crucify?

1032
01:14:50,330 --> 01:14:51,456
The motherfuckers?

1033
01:14:52,650 --> 01:14:56,177
Yeah, I'm gonna crucify the motherfuckers.

1034
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,890
Then those motherfuckers

1035
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,291
better watch out, all right?

1036
01:15:05,650 --> 01:15:06,617
Fucking A.

1037
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,056
Oh, what's this shit?

1038
01:15:12,610 --> 01:15:14,050
And as sad as the spectacle

1039
01:15:14,130 --> 01:15:16,292
of these burned out billboards might be,

1040
01:15:16,570 --> 01:15:18,250
in light of the death of Chief Willoughby,

1041
01:15:18,370 --> 01:15:19,410
this reporter for one

1042
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:21,170
wonders if this finally puts an end

1043
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:23,730
to the strange saga
of the three billboards outside...

1044
01:15:23,810 --> 01:15:26,050
This doesn't put an end to shit,
you fucking retard!

1045
01:15:26,130 --> 01:15:27,610
This is just the fucking start!

1046
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,650
Why don't you put that
on your Good Morning Missouri

1047
01:15:29,730 --> 01:15:31,858
fucking Wake Up broadcast, bitch!

1048
01:15:41,610 --> 01:15:44,130
I see on the TV
there were a bunch of fires

1049
01:15:44,210 --> 01:15:46,212
lit outside of town last night.

1050
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:49,290
Bunch of fires, huh?

1051
01:15:50,650 --> 01:15:52,459
Out at those billboards.

1052
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:56,130
Yeah, well, back when I was a cop,

1053
01:15:56,210 --> 01:15:58,090
I would have been interested
in who set those fires,

1054
01:15:58,170 --> 01:15:59,660
because, technically, that's arson.

1055
01:16:00,290 --> 01:16:02,250
But, as I'm no longer
employed by those people,

1056
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:04,332
I don't really give a good goddamn,
now do I?

1057
01:16:07,410 --> 01:16:08,332
I'll get it.

1058
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:15,297
Dixon residence.

1059
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:17,334
Hey, Dixon, it's Cedric.

1060
01:16:17,570 --> 01:16:20,096
Oh, hey, Sarge. Got any news?

1061
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:22,819
- News about what?
- I don't know.

1062
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:26,495
About my job and stuff?

1063
01:16:27,810 --> 01:16:29,778
No. No. What?

1064
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:31,137
No...

1065
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:34,130
Anne Willoughby just dropped in a letter

1066
01:16:34,210 --> 01:16:36,730
that... Bill wrote you before he died.

1067
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:38,050
What's it say?

1068
01:16:38,130 --> 01:16:40,417
Oh, I haven't read it, Dixon.
It's not my letter.

1069
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,650
Oh, well, listen,
I'll... I'll come right down.

1070
01:16:42,730 --> 01:16:45,051
Um, I'll be there
in like 15 minutes.

1071
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:46,456
Well...

1072
01:16:47,410 --> 01:16:50,330
Yeah, I d...
I don't think that'd be such a great idea,

1073
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,617
things as they stand, Jason.

1074
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:54,210
You... you still got your keys

1075
01:16:54,290 --> 01:16:56,210
to the station house, though, right?

1076
01:16:56,290 --> 01:16:57,290
Yeah.

1077
01:16:57,370 --> 01:16:59,850
Well, why don't you come and pick it up

1078
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,170
after everyone's gone home?

1079
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,820
I can leave it on your desk for you.

1080
01:17:05,610 --> 01:17:06,657
On, okay.

1081
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,421
Actually, yeah, then...

1082
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,900
when you're done, you can... you can...

1083
01:17:12,090 --> 01:17:13,615
just leave the keys...

1084
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:16,534
you know, save us picking 'em up later.

1085
01:17:19,810 --> 01:17:20,697
All right.

1086
01:17:48,850 --> 01:17:50,810
Jason, Willoughby here.

1087
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:53,097
I'm dead now. Sorry about that.

1088
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:55,050
There's something I wanted to say to you

1089
01:17:55,130 --> 01:17:57,417
that I never really said when I was alive.

1090
01:17:59,090 --> 01:18:00,570
I think you've got the makings

1091
01:18:00,650 --> 01:18:03,570
of being a really good cop, Jason.

1092
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:04,651
And you know why?

1093
01:18:06,450 --> 01:18:09,852
Because deep down you're a decent man.

1094
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,290
I know you don't think I think that,

1095
01:18:12,370 --> 01:18:14,134
but I do, dipshit.

1096
01:18:21,370 --> 01:18:23,691
I do think you're too angry, though.

1097
01:18:26,250 --> 01:18:28,450
And I know it's all since your dad died

1098
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,976
and you had to go
look after your mom and all.

1099
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:37,850
But as long as you hold on
to so much hate, then I don't think

1100
01:18:37,930 --> 01:18:39,500
you're ever gonna become...

1101
01:18:40,130 --> 01:18:41,575
...what I know you wanna become.

1102
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:46,096
A detective.

1103
01:18:52,690 --> 01:18:54,330
Because you know what you need

1104
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:55,571
to become a detective?

1105
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,738
And I know you're gonna wince
when I say this...

1106
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:05,459
But what you need
to become a detective... is love.

1107
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,057
Fuck 'em.

1108
01:19:15,370 --> 01:19:18,130
Because through love comes calm,

1109
01:19:18,210 --> 01:19:20,258
and through calm comes thought.

1110
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:24,537
And you need thought
to detect stuff sometimes, Jason.

1111
01:19:30,010 --> 01:19:31,250
It's kinda all you need.

1112
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:33,535
You don't even need a gun.

1113
01:19:33,890 --> 01:19:35,619
And you definitely don't need hate.

1114
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:38,094
Hate never solved nothing.

1115
01:19:43,010 --> 01:19:45,650
But calm did. And thought did.

1116
01:19:45,730 --> 01:19:48,461
Try it. Try it just for a change.

1117
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:51,810
No one will think you're gay.

1118
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:54,894
And if they do,
arrest them for homophobia.

1119
01:19:55,170 --> 01:19:56,695
Won't they be surprised?

1120
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:01,060
Good luck to you, Jason.
You're a decent man.

1121
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:03,571
And yeah, you've had a run of bad luck...

1122
01:20:05,250 --> 01:20:08,538
but things are gonna change
for you. I can feel it.

1123
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:39,817
Calm.

1124
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:41,971
Calm.

1125
01:20:43,570 --> 01:20:44,457
Calm.

1126
01:22:05,610 --> 01:22:06,690
So, what'd you see?

1127
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:08,932
Well, when we turned
the corner from Spring,

1128
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:10,856
the fire was already raging,

1129
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,970
and about two seconds later the cop fella,

1130
01:22:14,050 --> 01:22:15,690
- he just jumps out of the window.
- Wait.

1131
01:22:16,610 --> 01:22:18,897
The two of you turned
the corner from Spring?

1132
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:22,370
- Where were you before this?
- Round... round my place.

1133
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:27,181
You two boyfriend and girlfriend?

1134
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:31,935
Early stages, you know.

1135
01:22:33,570 --> 01:22:34,492
Is that right?

1136
01:22:35,090 --> 01:22:36,501
We had a couple dates.

1137
01:22:46,810 --> 01:22:48,570
You wanna go out to dinner
with me next week?

1138
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:52,259
Yeah, I'll go out to dinner with ya.

1139
01:22:55,090 --> 01:22:56,330
But I ain't gonna fuck ya.

1140
01:22:58,010 --> 01:23:00,172
Well, I... I ain't gonna fuck you neither.

1141
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:03,977
I guess.

1142
01:23:19,090 --> 01:23:21,775
Burn victim.
He's pretty heavily sedated.

1143
01:23:31,290 --> 01:23:32,132
Hey, man.

1144
01:23:32,970 --> 01:23:35,052
You doing okay? Jeez.

1145
01:23:35,970 --> 01:23:38,337
You got burned up pretty bad, huh?

1146
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,176
You'll be okay though.

1147
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:45,938
You, you want
a glass of orange juice?

1148
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,332
I got a straw somewhere.

1149
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,137
Hey.

1150
01:23:52,650 --> 01:23:53,572
Don't cry.

1151
01:23:55,970 --> 01:23:57,301
You'll be... you'll be okay.

1152
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:02,220
I... I'm sorry, Welby.

1153
01:24:06,050 --> 01:24:08,178
- You know me?
- I'm sorry.

1154
01:24:10,890 --> 01:24:12,574
You're sorry... sorry for what?

1155
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,260
For throwing you out the window.

1156
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:25,170
I'm sorry, man.

1157
01:24:25,250 --> 01:24:26,297
I don't care!

1158
01:24:27,490 --> 01:24:29,618
Stop fucking crying, God damn it!

1159
01:24:30,370 --> 01:24:32,179
The salt'll just fuck up your wounds.

1160
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:35,250
I thought salt
was supposed to be good for your wounds.

1161
01:24:35,650 --> 01:24:37,334
What am I, a fucking doctor?

1162
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:48,372
Who is it?

1163
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,175
Oh, you don't know me really.

1164
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:54,691
Well, what do you want?

1165
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,460
I come about the billboards.

1166
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:00,456
- What about 'em?
- They got burned up.

1167
01:26:00,850 --> 01:26:01,737
I know that.

1168
01:26:02,970 --> 01:26:05,177
I'm one of the guys
who put 'em up in the first place.

1169
01:26:09,410 --> 01:26:10,297
Jerome.

1170
01:26:12,570 --> 01:26:13,770
What can I do for you, Jerome?

1171
01:26:14,450 --> 01:26:16,730
Well, when you put up
a bunch of posters like that,

1172
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:19,970
just in case any of them
get screwed up or torn, they...

1173
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:22,337
give you a set of duplicates, you know?

1174
01:26:23,810 --> 01:26:25,175
No, I didn't know that.

1175
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:36,536
Ladder's pretty steady
as it is there, James.

1176
01:26:37,930 --> 01:26:40,695
Oh, that's okay.
I... I like holding ladders.

1177
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:42,131
Takes me out of myself.

1178
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:48,901
- Need a hand?
- Hey!

1179
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:51,973
- When'd you get out?
- An hour ago.

1180
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:53,610
Judge threw it out.

1181
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:55,570
Said the arrest report
weren't filled out right.

1182
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,252
Say, you...

1183
01:27:02,170 --> 01:27:04,890
Say, you didn't burn down
the police station, did you?

1184
01:27:04,970 --> 01:27:06,540
No, she was with me the whole night.

1185
01:27:09,370 --> 01:27:10,970
- Why would... okay.
- It's a long story.

1186
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:12,416
Hey.

1187
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:13,977
Hey.

1188
01:27:15,090 --> 01:27:16,530
Still wanna put up the Willoughby one,

1189
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:17,736
him being dead and all?

1190
01:27:18,130 --> 01:27:19,939
Why not? He paid for it.

1191
01:27:20,650 --> 01:27:21,651
True.

1192
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,335
Look at this fucking asshole.

1193
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:12,930
- First round's on you?
- Yeah.

1194
01:28:29,890 --> 01:28:31,096
Well, here we are.

1195
01:28:33,370 --> 01:28:34,417
Here we are.

1196
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:38,770
I like cheesy things.

1197
01:28:38,850 --> 01:28:40,500
I'm gonna look for cheesy things.

1198
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:42,417
All right.

1199
01:28:49,770 --> 01:28:50,612
Who's that?

1200
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:52,610
My ex-husband.

1201
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,093
And his 19-year-old girlfriend.

1202
01:28:58,570 --> 01:29:00,254
- You wanna leave?
- No, no.

1203
01:29:01,130 --> 01:29:02,052
Deal's a deal.

1204
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:05,970
It was fucking wild, man.

1205
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:09,134
I think I was certifiably fucking insane
for a while back there.

1206
01:29:10,010 --> 01:29:13,093
- When was this?
- About nine, ten months ago.

1207
01:29:13,210 --> 01:29:14,450
Were you on your own or what?

1208
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:15,895
I had a couple of buddies with me.

1209
01:29:16,250 --> 01:29:17,854
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1210
01:29:18,250 --> 01:29:19,297
They fuck her too?

1211
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,181
I think they got their kicks
just watching, you know?

1212
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:25,652
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1213
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,217
Was she hot?

1214
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:29,817
Once the gasoline kicked in
she was hot.

1215
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,257
I swear, I wanted
to fuck her even more right then.

1216
01:29:35,930 --> 01:29:37,932
I don't know if I could
get that out of my mind.

1217
01:30:19,530 --> 01:30:21,010
I ain't going down for that shit,

1218
01:30:21,090 --> 01:30:22,210
last fucking day down there.

1219
01:30:30,090 --> 01:30:32,821
- He been there the whole time?
- Who?

1220
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:35,701
Burnt face Jake.
Keeps fucking walking up and down.

1221
01:30:36,530 --> 01:30:38,100
I don't know. I don't think so.

1222
01:30:46,570 --> 01:30:47,810
- Another round?
- Yeah.

1223
01:30:51,370 --> 01:30:52,531
Eight bucks.

1224
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:26,097
Maestro.

1225
01:31:31,210 --> 01:31:32,621
Can I help you with something?

1226
01:31:32,770 --> 01:31:33,692
Excuse me?

1227
01:31:34,570 --> 01:31:36,090
You keep looking over here
all fucking night.

1228
01:31:36,170 --> 01:31:38,010
Now, unless you've got
something to say to me,

1229
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:39,570
why don't you take
your burnt fucking face

1230
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,050
and get the fuck out of here, okay?

1231
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:45,570
- No, I... scoot over.
- What are you doing? What are you doing?

1232
01:31:45,650 --> 01:31:47,970
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1233
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,696
Just trust me, okay?

1234
01:31:50,770 --> 01:31:51,817
You like magic?

1235
01:31:55,410 --> 01:31:57,538
- Just trust me.
- Just do the fucking trick, man.

1236
01:32:00,010 --> 01:32:00,977
Okay.

1237
01:32:10,010 --> 01:32:10,977
What the fuck!

1238
01:32:14,010 --> 01:32:15,057
Hey.

1239
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:16,892
Hey!

1240
01:32:17,410 --> 01:32:19,530
- Hey! That's enough now!
- What's it to you, fucker?

1241
01:32:19,610 --> 01:32:20,850
The guy's a cop, man. He's a cop.

1242
01:32:20,930 --> 01:32:21,817
Oh, yeah?

1243
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:24,451
He ain't wearing no badge.

1244
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:26,496
I lost my badge.

1245
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,010
Can't remember where I lost it.

1246
01:32:30,090 --> 01:32:33,253
Hey, you started this, man!
I didn't do shit to you!

1247
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:35,420
I know I started it.

1248
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,970
I scratched you up like a bitch.

1249
01:32:38,050 --> 01:32:39,540
That's exactly fucking right.

1250
01:32:56,130 --> 01:32:58,292
I'm gonna go use the little boy's room.

1251
01:33:10,210 --> 01:33:11,330
You got something to say to me?

1252
01:33:11,410 --> 01:33:13,170
If I'd known, we could have double dated.

1253
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:16,140
Doesn't shit girl have
a curfew weeknights?

1254
01:33:16,450 --> 01:33:17,570
No. No.

1255
01:33:17,650 --> 01:33:20,570
In fact, I was actually gonna take her
to the circus later,

1256
01:33:20,650 --> 01:33:22,971
but there's no need now.
Does he juggle?

1257
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:26,539
Look, I'm having one dinner with the guy,
'cause he did me a favor, okay?

1258
01:33:26,970 --> 01:33:28,610
You don't have to explain yourself to me

1259
01:33:28,690 --> 01:33:30,370
'cause you're having dinner
with a midget, Mildred.

1260
01:33:30,450 --> 01:33:32,090
I'm not explaining myself to you.

1261
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,092
You kind of are.

1262
01:33:38,650 --> 01:33:41,050
Look, I didn't come over here
to break your balls.

1263
01:33:41,130 --> 01:33:43,053
You can date as many midgets as you want.

1264
01:33:43,730 --> 01:33:44,572
No.

1265
01:33:45,170 --> 01:33:48,250
No, I came over to say
I was sorry, actually.

1266
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:49,491
Sorry for what?

1267
01:33:50,290 --> 01:33:52,250
Sorry about what happened
to your billboards and all.

1268
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:55,334
Yeah, well, it's all water
under the bridge, I guess.

1269
01:33:55,450 --> 01:33:56,656
Good.

1270
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:59,973
I'm glad. I was pretty drunk,
but it still don't excuse it.

1271
01:34:02,730 --> 01:34:04,061
All this anger, man.

1272
01:34:05,450 --> 01:34:07,054
Penelope said to me the other day...

1273
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:10,816
"It just begets greater anger."

1274
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:12,812
You know?

1275
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:14,451
It's true.

1276
01:34:17,210 --> 01:34:18,735
Penelope said, "Begets"?

1277
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:21,292
Yeah.

1278
01:34:22,410 --> 01:34:24,412
"It begets greater anger."

1279
01:34:27,810 --> 01:34:28,697
Well...

1280
01:34:29,810 --> 01:34:32,381
You take care of this
little lady, okay, sport?

1281
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:35,257
Big lady compared to you, right?

1282
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,378
- You all right?
- I think I wanna go home now.

1283
01:34:47,970 --> 01:34:49,170
Don't give me any shit, James.

1284
01:34:49,250 --> 01:34:50,730
We'll do it another night, all right?

1285
01:34:52,210 --> 01:34:54,050
Why would I want to do it another night?

1286
01:34:54,130 --> 01:34:54,938
You've been...

1287
01:34:55,730 --> 01:34:57,450
embarrassed to be here
ever since we arrived.

1288
01:34:57,530 --> 01:34:58,770
Oh, for Christ sake.

1289
01:34:59,290 --> 01:35:01,330
I didn't force you
to come on this date, all right?

1290
01:35:01,410 --> 01:35:02,616
You forced me.

1291
01:35:04,090 --> 01:35:05,979
F... forced you?

1292
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:10,095
I asked you on a date.

1293
01:35:10,770 --> 01:35:12,170
You know...

1294
01:35:12,250 --> 01:35:15,572
I know
I'm not that much of a catch.

1295
01:35:16,330 --> 01:35:18,530
I know I'm a dwarf who sells used cars

1296
01:35:18,610 --> 01:35:20,339
and has a drinking problem. I know that.

1297
01:35:20,730 --> 01:35:22,141
But who the hell are you, man?

1298
01:35:22,690 --> 01:35:25,810
You're that billboard lady
who never smiles,

1299
01:35:25,890 --> 01:35:27,813
never has a good word
to say about anybody,

1300
01:35:28,170 --> 01:35:29,850
and who, in the evening times,

1301
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,659
sets fucking fire to police stations!

1302
01:35:33,610 --> 01:35:36,375
And I'm the one who's not a catch?

1303
01:35:38,610 --> 01:35:39,532
Hey!

1304
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:44,255
You know, I didn't have to
come and hold your ladder.

1305
01:36:10,690 --> 01:36:11,896
Now, don't make a scene.

1306
01:36:15,130 --> 01:36:17,895
Did you really tell him
"Anger begets greater anger"?

1307
01:36:18,690 --> 01:36:20,730
Yes! I did.

1308
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,090
I didn't make it up
myself though.

1309
01:36:22,170 --> 01:36:23,530
I can't claim that.

1310
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:25,578
No, I read it on a bookmark...

1311
01:36:27,490 --> 01:36:28,980
which was in a book I was reading...

1312
01:36:30,770 --> 01:36:31,896
about polio.

1313
01:36:33,490 --> 01:36:36,090
Polo. No.
Which is the one with the horses?

1314
01:36:36,170 --> 01:36:37,170
Polio or polo?

1315
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:38,297
- Polo.
- Polo.

1316
01:36:49,810 --> 01:36:51,380
Be nice to her, Charlie.

1317
01:36:53,490 --> 01:36:54,412
You got that?

1318
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:10,050
Jason!

1319
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,450
- Jason. Jason!
- Don't look at me.

1320
01:37:11,530 --> 01:37:13,090
- Don't look at me!
- What have they done to you?

1321
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:14,774
- Leave me, Momma!
- Are you...

1322
01:37:15,250 --> 01:37:16,490
No. No!

1323
01:37:16,650 --> 01:37:18,140
Oh, don't lock me...

1324
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:21,335
Open up this door!

1325
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,700
Please, Jason.

1326
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:27,221
Let me help you. Please.

1327
01:37:30,010 --> 01:37:33,696
You're my baby boy.
Open this door.

1328
01:37:34,650 --> 01:37:35,731
Please.

1329
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:39,652
Jason, please.

1330
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:44,056
Please.

1331
01:37:45,050 --> 01:37:47,496
Please open the door.

1332
01:37:55,570 --> 01:37:56,856
Open up!

1333
01:37:58,890 --> 01:38:00,130
Jason!

1334
01:38:01,770 --> 01:38:02,976
I'm all right, Momma.

1335
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:05,295
It's all gonna be all right.

1336
01:38:29,770 --> 01:38:31,290
I don't wanna get
your hopes up, all right,

1337
01:38:31,370 --> 01:38:32,930
but there is a guy, and I think

1338
01:38:33,010 --> 01:38:35,854
he might be the guy. I got his DNA.

1339
01:38:36,850 --> 01:38:38,011
Got a lot of it, actually.

1340
01:38:38,890 --> 01:38:40,810
They're making the checks as we speak.

1341
01:38:40,890 --> 01:38:41,891
He's in jail?

1342
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:45,376
No, but he ain't gonna be hard to find.

1343
01:38:46,570 --> 01:38:47,850
Why do you think he's the guy?

1344
01:38:47,930 --> 01:38:49,210
I heard him talking about

1345
01:38:49,290 --> 01:38:51,290
something he did to a girl
the middle of last year.

1346
01:38:52,090 --> 01:38:53,535
I couldn't hear all of it, but...

1347
01:38:55,410 --> 01:38:57,936
It sounded a lot like
what happened to Angela.

1348
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:01,380
And then he beat
the crap out of me.

1349
01:39:01,850 --> 01:39:02,931
But because of that...

1350
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:05,134
I got a bunch of his DNA.

1351
01:39:06,170 --> 01:39:07,410
So, I wanted to...

1352
01:39:08,770 --> 01:39:11,210
let you know sooner rather than later.

1353
01:39:11,290 --> 01:39:13,054
I didn't want you
to give up hope, you know?

1354
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:15,776
I've been trying not to.

1355
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:17,412
Well...

1356
01:39:18,810 --> 01:39:20,090
all you can do is try.

1357
01:39:20,170 --> 01:39:21,581
As my momma says...

1358
01:39:22,450 --> 01:39:24,373
not so much about hope as about...

1359
01:39:26,330 --> 01:39:29,459
well, I didn't used to be
very good at English at school.

1360
01:39:29,890 --> 01:39:31,410
So it was more
"All you can do is try"

1361
01:39:31,490 --> 01:39:33,936
"to not be so crap at English."

1362
01:39:36,890 --> 01:39:39,291
Because you need English,
really, if you wanna be a cop.

1363
01:39:40,330 --> 01:39:42,537
If you wanna be anything, really.

1364
01:39:49,290 --> 01:39:51,133
Unless you live in Mexico or something.

1365
01:39:52,650 --> 01:39:54,220
Who wants that?

1366
01:40:15,490 --> 01:40:16,457
Hey, Dixon?

1367
01:40:22,010 --> 01:40:22,932
Thank you.

1368
01:40:57,090 --> 01:40:58,376
You did good, Jason.

1369
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:00,855
You did real good.

1370
01:41:09,890 --> 01:41:11,255
But he wasn't the guy.

1371
01:41:19,010 --> 01:41:19,852
What?

1372
01:41:20,370 --> 01:41:22,054
There was no match to the DNA.

1373
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:25,016
No matches to any other crimes
of this nature.

1374
01:41:25,330 --> 01:41:26,934
To any crimes at all, in fact.

1375
01:41:28,010 --> 01:41:29,455
And his record is clean.

1376
01:41:30,810 --> 01:41:32,050
Maybe he was just bragging.

1377
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:36,130
- He wasn't just bragging.
- Well, that's as may be.

1378
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:37,894
But at the time of Angela's death...

1379
01:41:38,690 --> 01:41:40,055
he wasn't even in the country.

1380
01:41:40,730 --> 01:41:41,652
Where was he?

1381
01:41:42,490 --> 01:41:45,250
Well, I've seen his records
of entry and exit to the States,

1382
01:41:45,330 --> 01:41:47,298
and I've spoken to his commanding officer.

1383
01:41:48,450 --> 01:41:51,420
He wasn't in the country, Dixon.
He ain't our guy.

1384
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:53,660
No, he...

1385
01:41:56,370 --> 01:41:57,890
He... he might not be our guy,

1386
01:41:57,970 --> 01:41:59,570
but he still done something shitty.

1387
01:41:59,650 --> 01:42:00,697
I know he did.

1388
01:42:00,810 --> 01:42:02,255
Not in Missouri he didn't.

1389
01:42:03,010 --> 01:42:04,011
Where was he?

1390
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:06,890
That's classified information.

1391
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,415
Oh, come on, man.

1392
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:11,092
If the guy has a commanding officer,

1393
01:42:11,690 --> 01:42:14,375
and if the guy got back to the country
nine months ago,

1394
01:42:14,490 --> 01:42:17,570
and if the country
where he was is classified,

1395
01:42:17,650 --> 01:42:19,414
which country
do you think he was in?

1396
01:42:21,370 --> 01:42:22,610
Hey, you know...

1397
01:42:25,130 --> 01:42:26,211
I'll give you a clue.

1398
01:42:28,370 --> 01:42:29,496
It was sandy.

1399
01:42:34,130 --> 01:42:35,734
That doesn't really narrow it down.

1400
01:42:38,570 --> 01:42:40,530
All you need to know is that

1401
01:42:40,610 --> 01:42:42,530
he didn't do nothing to Angela Hayes,

1402
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:44,533
so... we're gonna keep looking.

1403
01:42:51,010 --> 01:42:51,897
All right?

1404
01:43:03,090 --> 01:43:04,899
I found my badge after all.

1405
01:44:12,890 --> 01:44:13,777
Hello?

1406
01:44:14,610 --> 01:44:15,611
It's Dixon.

1407
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:21,977
Tell me.

1408
01:44:25,170 --> 01:44:26,501
He wasn't the guy.

1409
01:44:42,770 --> 01:44:43,692
Mildred?

1410
01:44:54,370 --> 01:44:55,576
Are you sure?

1411
01:44:57,810 --> 01:45:00,973
He... he wasn't even in
the country when it happened.

1412
01:45:03,090 --> 01:45:04,330
So, whatever he did...

1413
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:07,660
he didn't do it round here.

1414
01:45:09,450 --> 01:45:11,259
I'm sorry I got your hopes up.

1415
01:45:12,250 --> 01:45:13,890
Well, that's all right. That's all right.

1416
01:45:16,930 --> 01:45:18,330
At least I had a day of hoping,

1417
01:45:18,410 --> 01:45:20,139
and that's more than I've had for a while.

1418
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:28,451
I gotta go.

1419
01:45:32,410 --> 01:45:33,650
There was...

1420
01:45:35,370 --> 01:45:37,213
There was one thing I was thinking.

1421
01:45:40,290 --> 01:45:41,416
What's that?

1422
01:45:42,490 --> 01:45:44,140
I know he ain't your rapist.

1423
01:45:45,730 --> 01:45:49,496
He is a rapist, though.
I'm sure of that.

1424
01:45:58,130 --> 01:45:59,256
What are you saying to me?

1425
01:46:01,850 --> 01:46:03,375
Got his license plate.

1426
01:46:06,610 --> 01:46:08,055
I know where he lives.

1427
01:46:11,330 --> 01:46:12,411
Where's he live?

1428
01:46:14,770 --> 01:46:16,010
He lives in Idaho.

1429
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:23,577
That's funny.

1430
01:46:27,090 --> 01:46:28,899
I'm driving to Idaho
in the morning.

1431
01:46:34,890 --> 01:46:36,096
Want some company?

1432
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:42,852
Sure.

1433
01:49:25,210 --> 01:49:27,338
- Hey, Dixon?
- Yeah?

1434
01:49:28,650 --> 01:49:29,890
I need to tell you something.

1435
01:49:32,570 --> 01:49:34,572
It was me that burned down
the police station.

1436
01:49:37,850 --> 01:49:39,500
Why, who the hell else
would it have been?

1437
01:49:52,130 --> 01:49:53,177
Dixon?

1438
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:54,971
Yup?

1439
01:49:55,770 --> 01:49:59,411
- Are you sure about this?
- About killing this guy?

1440
01:50:01,930 --> 01:50:03,853
Not really. You?

1441
01:50:07,410 --> 01:50:08,411
Not really.

1442
01:50:11,570 --> 01:50:13,254
I guess we can decide
along the way.
