1
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:35,051
Here's our stop, come on.

2
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:38,351
This time next week... California!

3
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,851
You excited?

4
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:41,950
Me, too. I can't wait.

5
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,150
Were you ever there?

6
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,651
Once, for six weeks,
touring with some musical.

7
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,150
In the middle of December we went swimming.

8
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,250
- Which musical?
- What's the difference?

9
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,350
I'm tryin' to tell you
how beautiful it's gonna be.

10
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:57,250
We're gonna look for a little house
way up in the hills.

11
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,550
Near the movie studios?

12
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,650
Yes, your window will face Warner Bros.

13
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,251
You can watch them blow up
the world from your bed. All right?

14
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:08,851
Oh, God. Can you imagine
your very own orange tree? And lemons!

15
00:01:08,951 --> 00:01:10,951
I think the musical was Fiddler on the Rool.

16
00:01:11,051 --> 00:01:13,251
I stayed with Grandma. I was 4½.

17
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:16,152
You were never 4½. You were born 26!

18
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,651
Do you think I'll be in the same grade?

19
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:25,651
Of course you will! Everything's the same
out there, only it's three hours earlier.

20
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:27,752
You'll graduate younger.

21
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:29,751
A girl from California's in our class.

22
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:32,151
She went to school
with Helen Reddy's daughter.

23
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:34,751
What about you?
After this picture they'll be saying:

24
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:36,951
"There goes Tony DeForrest's little girl."

25
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:39,851
Yeah, but he's not a star,
he's just an actor.

26
00:01:39,951 --> 00:01:41,651
Stars have to be actors first.

27
00:01:41,751 --> 00:01:45,551
- And he's not really my father!
- You're such a stickler for details!

28
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:47,651
Can I show Tony all my things first?

29
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:50,152
Later. You have homework to do.

30
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,251
We're moving in four days.
Do I have to do homework?

31
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:56,051
Suppose between now and Friday
they teach brain surgery?

32
00:01:56,151 --> 00:01:58,052
I wouldn't want you to miss it.

33
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:01,551
We had it last week in science.

34
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:04,952
- Are you serious?
- Dumb! You know you're dumb!

35
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:08,752
I thought maybe in frog dissection.
What do I know?

36
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:13,552
Can I just show him my new sweater and jeans?

37
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:14,753
All right!

38
00:02:17,552 --> 00:02:19,953
But wash your face and brush your hair.

39
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:22,453
And no makeup!

40
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:24,553
Tony?

41
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:26,953
Sweetheart?

42
00:02:27,852 --> 00:02:29,753
You in the bathroom?

43
00:02:31,352 --> 00:02:33,653
We cleaned out Alexander's!

44
00:02:35,052 --> 00:02:36,652
We bought everything on sale...

45
00:02:36,752 --> 00:02:39,853
...so you'd better like it
'cause we can't exchange it.

46
00:02:43,752 --> 00:02:47,153
I bought you a present. Babe?

47
00:02:47,952 --> 00:02:49,753
Come out and see!

48
00:02:50,452 --> 00:02:51,653
Babe?

49
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,454
Oh, my God!

50
00:03:30,053 --> 00:03:31,554
What happened?

51
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,854
He's gone!

52
00:03:36,353 --> 00:03:37,653
He left without us!

53
00:03:37,753 --> 00:03:39,254
For California?

54
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,154
For Italy.

55
00:03:42,153 --> 00:03:43,954
- Can I read it?
- Yeah.

56
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:49,154
"Dear Paula,
this isn't an easy letter to write."

57
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:52,654
Doesn't start off too good, does it?

58
00:03:53,853 --> 00:03:55,353
"Where in the hell do I begin?

59
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:57,853
"You know, you and the kid mean a lot to me."

60
00:03:57,953 --> 00:03:59,154
The kid?

61
00:04:02,053 --> 00:04:06,854
"I turned down the job in L.A.
It was just a lousy TV picture anyway.

62
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,854
"On Monday, Stan Fields called.

63
00:04:10,453 --> 00:04:14,054
"I got the Bertolu..."

64
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:15,653
Bertolucci.

65
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:17,353
"Bertolucci picture."

66
00:04:17,453 --> 00:04:20,654
- Who's Bartolucci?
- An Italian director.

67
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,055
What'd he direct?

68
00:04:22,754 --> 00:04:25,955
What are you asking questions
like that now for?

69
00:04:27,254 --> 00:04:29,654
"It's six months shooting in Spain and Italy.

70
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:32,654
"It's a hell of a part, and I want it.
I broke my ass..."

71
00:04:32,754 --> 00:04:35,555
- Give me that!
- "Ass!" I've heard the word before.

72
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:39,754
"I broke my ass for 12 years and things
are finally beginning to break for me.

73
00:04:39,854 --> 00:04:43,854
"I told you when you first moved in here
that it was never going to be permanent.

74
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:46,255
"I'm not even divorced from Patti yet."

75
00:04:46,754 --> 00:04:47,955
Who's Patti?

76
00:04:49,654 --> 00:04:52,455
- I told you about her.
- No, you didn't.

77
00:04:53,654 --> 00:04:57,755
I thought you would be upset if you knew
you were living with a married man.

78
00:04:58,054 --> 00:05:01,955
I wasn't living with him, you were.
I was in the next room.

79
00:05:02,354 --> 00:05:04,855
They were practically divorced.

80
00:05:06,054 --> 00:05:10,555
"I left early today because I didn't think
a goodbye scene would do us any good."

81
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:15,155
This is one of the worst letters
I've ever read in my whole life.

82
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,755
Isn't it terrible?

83
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,054
"I wish I had something
to leave you and the kid."

84
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:26,356
He didn't leave us anything?

85
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:34,156
"I had to sell my watch and camera
to pay off the loan sharks."

86
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:36,455
He owed money to sharks?

87
00:05:36,555 --> 00:05:38,956
I'll explain it some other time.

88
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:42,855
"But I know you'll be all right.
You can always go back to dancing."

89
00:05:42,955 --> 00:05:46,756
Dancing? I'm 33. I can hardly walk anymore.

90
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:49,055
"You deserve more than I can give.

91
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,555
"I wish the both of us
all the luck in the world.

92
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:54,055
- "Love to the kid."
- Don't read anymore.

93
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:56,856
There's just one more word: "Tony."

94
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,056
Throw it away!

95
00:06:06,755 --> 00:06:09,756
Does this mean we're not going to California?

96
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,056
Yes.

97
00:06:19,555 --> 00:06:22,556
That means I have to do my homework, right?

98
00:06:40,956 --> 00:06:44,757
I see you, Paula. You can't hide from me!
Down, up and over.

99
00:06:46,456 --> 00:06:47,557
Once again!

100
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:50,056
What have you done to your body?

101
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:51,856
It died! Have a little respect.

102
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:53,057
Once again.

103
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:56,957
Come on, Paula, push.

104
00:07:06,656 --> 00:07:07,657
Paula?

105
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:10,957
Donna. Donna Douglas.

106
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,356
I was the swing girl
when you were in Company.

107
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:16,657
Oh, yes! Hello, Donna.

108
00:07:17,556 --> 00:07:19,757
Tough getting back into shape?

109
00:07:20,156 --> 00:07:24,757
It's been two years. It's amazing
how flabby you get when you're happy.

110
00:07:29,456 --> 00:07:30,757
Hi, Mrs. Crosby.

111
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:33,758
You leavin' tonight or in the mornin'?

112
00:07:34,157 --> 00:07:35,657
I'm sorry, what was that?

113
00:07:35,757 --> 00:07:38,358
Just checkin' on what time
you'll be vacatin'.

114
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:42,357
We're not going to California.
I forgot to tell you.

115
00:07:42,457 --> 00:07:46,057
I'm not the only one you forgot to tell!
That apartment's been sublet.

116
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:47,357
Wait a minute!

117
00:07:47,457 --> 00:07:49,557
What? What are you talking about?

118
00:07:49,657 --> 00:07:52,257
We're paid up through June.
We have three more months.

119
00:07:52,357 --> 00:07:54,157
You can't sublet that apartment!

120
00:07:54,257 --> 00:07:56,458
I'm not! Your young man did, honey.

121
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:59,758
He sublet our apartment?

122
00:08:00,257 --> 00:08:01,857
He notified me last night.

123
00:08:01,957 --> 00:08:04,457
It's his name on the lease.
He can do what he wants.

124
00:08:04,557 --> 00:08:06,557
Make sure you leave it like you found it.

125
00:08:06,657 --> 00:08:07,857
I'm not leaving it!

126
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:11,558
I cleaned it and painted it and decorated it!
It's mine!

127
00:08:11,857 --> 00:08:15,357
I don't care what he's done!
I'm not getting out! Do you understand?

128
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:19,557
That's none of my business, honey!
You can take that up with the sublettee.

129
00:08:19,657 --> 00:08:22,358
I just don't want no trouble in my building.

130
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:28,358
That bastard! That no good bastard!

131
00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:08,760
Who's that?

132
00:10:10,859 --> 00:10:12,260
I don't know.

133
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,660
Maybe it's Tony! Maybe he changed
his mind and came back.

134
00:10:16,859 --> 00:10:18,260
You're so young.

135
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,960
Stay there.

136
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:34,660
Who is it?

137
00:10:35,359 --> 00:10:36,860
Elliot Garfield.

138
00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:38,560
Who?

139
00:10:38,859 --> 00:10:41,360
Elliot Garfield, from Chicago! Is Tony in?

140
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:44,860
There's nobody by that name here.

141
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,361
Wait a second.

142
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,561
3A, this is the right apartment.
I was here once about two years ago.

143
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,361
I don't care what apartment you've got,
there's no whatever-his-name-is here.

144
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,760
Could you open the door for a second?

145
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,160
Not at 12:05.

146
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,861
You got a latch, you can keep it on.
I just want to talk to you for one second.

147
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,060
Make it fast. My husband's sleeping.

148
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,860
I think there's been a mistake.

149
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,860
I sublet this apartment
from a friend of mine, Tony DeForrest.

150
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,560
- He lives here.
- That'll be news to my husband, Charlie.

151
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
I have a receipt here in my pocket
for three months rent.

152
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,660
I was supposed to arrive tomorrow,
but I came a day early...

153
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:35,261
...because I'm starting work in the morning
and I figured I could spend the night here.

154
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,660
You look confused.
Can I talk to your husband?

155
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,360
He'll be at the 37th Precinct
at 9:00 in the morning.

156
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,861
Charlie D'Agostino, Homicide. Good night.

157
00:11:53,661 --> 00:11:54,561
Who was it?

158
00:11:54,661 --> 00:11:55,961
Never mind.

159
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:58,261
Didn't sound like a "never mind" to me.

160
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:02,362
Tony rented the apartment to someone,
but I'm not giving it up. It's ours.

161
00:12:03,061 --> 00:12:04,361
Go to sleep.

162
00:12:04,461 --> 00:12:07,161
He rented the apartment.
You mean we have to leave?

163
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:08,461
Over my dead body.

164
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,061
What if they force us?

165
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:12,162
Let 'em try. Go to sleep.

166
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:16,062
He rented the apartment. What a shitheel!

167
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:38,061
- Hello?
- Hello. Is Tony there, please?

168
00:12:38,161 --> 00:12:39,362
Who's calling?

169
00:12:39,661 --> 00:12:44,162
You know who's calling. I was just there.
I recognize your voice, Mrs. D'Agostino!

170
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:45,261
Mrs. Who?

171
00:12:45,361 --> 00:12:49,962
D'Agostino! How come your telephone
answers to Tony DeForrest's number?

172
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:54,362
And how come the key he sent me
Air Mail special delivery opens your door?

173
00:12:56,461 --> 00:12:58,362
You want to answer those questions?

174
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:00,663
- No. Why don't you answer?
- I will.

175
00:13:01,062 --> 00:13:03,962
I think the answer is
something fishy's going on up there!

176
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:06,462
I'm wet as a herring,
Mrs. Whatever-your-name-is...

177
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:08,862
...and I don't have a place to sleep tonight.

178
00:13:08,962 --> 00:13:12,363
And I don't want to blow
my last few bucks on a hotel!

179
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:17,263
According to my non-waterproof watch...

180
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:21,362
...it's at least 12:20 and technically
that apartment belongs to me.

181
00:13:21,462 --> 00:13:24,262
Do I come up there now
and we discuss this amicably...

182
00:13:24,362 --> 00:13:26,562
...or do I storm the place in the morning?

183
00:13:26,662 --> 00:13:29,563
I've got a gun! I'll use it if I have to!

184
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:37,963
Change? You got change for $1? Goddamn it!

185
00:13:40,062 --> 00:13:43,263
I got a pregnant wife in the lobby.
I just want change...

186
00:13:46,862 --> 00:13:48,463
We're in trouble, right?

187
00:13:48,762 --> 00:13:53,263
We're not in trouble. We have our rights.
Possession is nine-tenths of the law.

188
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:55,062
What's the other tenth?

189
00:13:55,162 --> 00:13:56,363
Shut up.

190
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,363
- Is that the last tenth?
- Go to bed. I will handle this.

191
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,063
Hello?

192
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:11,463
I called the 37th Precinct.
There's no Charles D'Agostino in Homicide.

193
00:14:11,563 --> 00:14:13,863
Then I called Rita Scott,
an actress friend...

194
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:16,563
...who was in The Merchant of Venice
with Tony DeForrest.

195
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:19,963
Rita told me about a girl Tony's living with,
Paula McFadden...

196
00:14:20,063 --> 00:14:22,463
...a former dancer
and her 10-year-old daughter.

197
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:26,163
She also told me that the apartment
is leased in the name of Tony DeForrest.

198
00:14:26,263 --> 00:14:30,964
She knows this for a fact because
she lived with him, prior to Paula and Lucy.

199
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:35,263
Now, can we continue this conversation
in a drier room, Miss McFadden?

200
00:14:35,363 --> 00:14:37,763
Take your problems up
with the Housing Authority!

201
00:14:37,863 --> 00:14:38,863
Don't hang up!

202
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:41,864
Please? I don't have any more change.

203
00:14:42,163 --> 00:14:46,064
I'm soaked to the bone,
and I have a very low threshold for disease.

204
00:14:46,363 --> 00:14:49,264
Look, I don't know what Tony told you, but...

205
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:52,964
...he's got my money, and I got a lease,
and you got the apartment.

206
00:14:53,263 --> 00:14:56,264
Now one of us got screwed!
Let me rephrase that.

207
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:59,663
We have to talk this out,
and I am in no condition...

208
00:14:59,763 --> 00:15:03,063
...financial or health-wise,
to look for a hotel in the pouring rain.

209
00:15:03,163 --> 00:15:06,364
If there's any such thing as the 78th St. Flu,
I think I've got it.

210
00:15:06,464 --> 00:15:08,564
Why not take a shot in a convenient place?

211
00:15:08,664 --> 00:15:09,464
Five minutes...

212
00:15:09,564 --> 00:15:11,865
...that's all I'm asking! What is it?

213
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:14,364
In about 30 seconds we're gonna get cut off.

214
00:15:14,464 --> 00:15:16,764
My number's 873-5261.

215
00:15:16,864 --> 00:15:19,064
It's a flooded booth on Amsterdam Avenue.

216
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:21,764
If you have any compassion
in your heart whatsoever...

217
00:15:21,864 --> 00:15:23,364
I'm tryin', Operator!

218
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,464
Any compassion in your heart,
you'll call me back. 873-5261.

219
00:15:26,564 --> 00:15:29,165
That number again is 873-52... Oh, shit!

220
00:15:39,264 --> 00:15:40,965
Hello, thank you!

221
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:45,864
Five minutes!

222
00:15:45,964 --> 00:15:48,965
Leave your bags.
This isn't a permanent conversation.

223
00:15:54,764 --> 00:15:57,364
- I'm dripping on your rug.
- It's been done before.

224
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:00,564
I'm sorry, I didn't know there were going
to be any complications.

225
00:16:00,664 --> 00:16:02,764
There's a lot of that going around.

226
00:16:02,864 --> 00:16:05,464
I don't blame you for being hostile.
I get the picture.

227
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,864
Tony rented me the apartment
and split with the money.

228
00:16:07,964 --> 00:16:10,165
Then you and your daughter got dumped on.

229
00:16:10,965 --> 00:16:12,265
That is your version.

230
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:15,265
My version is that Tony and I
amicably end our relationship.

231
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:18,865
We agreed I'd keep the apartment
and you and your $600 got dumped on.

232
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:20,866
- Get the picture?
- Very sharp.

233
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:24,066
That's very sharp!
You're a sharp New York girl, right?

234
00:16:24,365 --> 00:16:26,066
No, a dull Cincinnati kid.

235
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:29,266
But you get dumped on enough,
you start to develop an edge.

236
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:33,366
So what's the deal?
I got a lease in my pocket.

237
00:16:34,065 --> 00:16:35,465
You gonna honor it or what?

238
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:38,665
I got a daughter in my bed.
That tops the lease in your pocket.

239
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:42,466
I don't want to get legal.
Legal happens to be on my side.

240
00:16:43,165 --> 00:16:45,565
I happen to have
a lawyer acquaintance downtown.

241
00:16:45,665 --> 00:16:49,065
Now all I gotta do is call
this lawyer acquaintance of mine...

242
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:50,166
What?

243
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:56,166
An actor. Another goddamn actor!

244
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:03,666
"I happen to have a lawyer acquaintance."
Right out of Streetcar Named Desire.

245
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:08,465
- Stanley Kowalski in summer stock, right?
- Wrong! Chicago in the dead of winter.

246
00:17:08,565 --> 00:17:10,865
Three and a half months
at the Drury Lane Theater.

247
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,065
Ask an actor a question, you get his credits.

248
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:13,965
Reviews?

249
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:17,766
"Garfield brings to Kowalski dimensions
even Brando hadn't investigated!"

250
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:22,167
Terrific! You write beautifully!
Aren't you a little short to play Stanley?

251
00:17:22,366 --> 00:17:24,966
Nobody noticed. I stood on a table.
Are you a critic?

252
00:17:25,066 --> 00:17:28,866
No, I love actors, as long as they stay
up on the stage where they belong.

253
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:32,166
You put them down in real life
and the whole world gets screwed up.

254
00:17:32,266 --> 00:17:33,867
Well, I have had enough!

255
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:38,367
I am not getting kicked out
of the same lousy apartment twice.

256
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,666
You want your money back, go to Naples.

257
00:17:40,766 --> 00:17:43,966
You want this apartment,
buy me two tickets to California.

258
00:17:44,066 --> 00:17:47,166
I'll give you two minutes
to think it over before I yell rape.

259
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:49,967
You are really somethin', you know that?

260
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,866
I'm surprised Tony didn't take a job
in the Philippines.

261
00:17:52,966 --> 00:17:54,966
I hope you're thinking, 'cause I'm counting.

262
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:59,466
Will you wait a second?
Just hold it! Can we make a deal?

263
00:17:59,566 --> 00:18:02,166
- What kind of a deal?
- I don't know, I just got here.

264
00:18:02,266 --> 00:18:04,166
- Can I have a cup of coffee?
- No!

265
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:06,967
Don't be bashful,
just say what's on your mind!

266
00:18:07,866 --> 00:18:10,366
All right, here is the situation...

267
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:12,066
I know the situation!

268
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:14,666
Let me say it out loud.
I don't believe this myself!

269
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:17,966
Number one, I have a job off-Broadway
but no place to sleep tonight.

270
00:18:18,066 --> 00:18:21,267
Number two, you don't have any money,
but you've got my apartment.

271
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:23,067
And you have a daughter to think about.

272
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:24,767
I am thinking of her right now!

273
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,868
Do me the courtesy of hearing me out! Please!

274
00:18:28,167 --> 00:18:31,368
You are not the only one
who can scream "rape," you know.

275
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:35,068
We are both in a bind, the two of us.

276
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:38,767
I think the only practical solution
is that we share the apartment.

277
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:39,867
I accept.

278
00:18:39,967 --> 00:18:40,667
What?

279
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,768
I accept. I may be stubborn
but I'm not stupid.

280
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,068
Mean it?

281
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:48,867
I have a daughter who goes to school
and I have to start looking for a job.

282
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:52,467
You have a key! I'd have to stand guard
all day long to keep you out.

283
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:56,468
I accept. You win. Get your bags.
You get the small bedroom.

284
00:18:57,367 --> 00:18:59,768
What the hell am I getting myself into?

285
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,568
I'm in the wrong room.

286
00:19:09,867 --> 00:19:11,168
Hi, I'm Elliot.

287
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,368
Hello.

288
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:15,568
- You must be Lucy.
- That's right.

289
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:19,168
Elliot Garfield.
I'm moving into the other room.

290
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:22,868
I'm a friend of Tony's.
You know, Tony DeForrest.

291
00:19:24,167 --> 00:19:25,469
That's nice.

292
00:19:26,068 --> 00:19:28,669
- I'm an actor, too.
- Yeah?

293
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,169
Well, your mother knows.

294
00:19:31,468 --> 00:19:32,469
I see.

295
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:40,169
- Guess I'll be seein' you around.
- I guess so.

296
00:19:52,768 --> 00:19:53,869
Good night.

297
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:57,469
Jesus.

298
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:01,968
Just met Lucy.

299
00:20:02,068 --> 00:20:05,068
- What did you tell her?
- I was moving into the other room.

300
00:20:05,168 --> 00:20:08,768
- She seemed to take it in stride.
- You grow up fast in this apartment.

301
00:20:08,868 --> 00:20:10,368
The john is right over there.

302
00:20:10,468 --> 00:20:13,568
I'll get the rest of her things out
in the morning.

303
00:20:13,668 --> 00:20:18,069
Would you stop grinding your teeth for two
seconds? The noise is driving me crazy.

304
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:22,769
A dripping stranger from Chicago,
with a wet beard and dirty shoes...

305
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:26,268
...moves into my daughter's room
and you expect smiles?

306
00:20:26,368 --> 00:20:28,468
You're dynamite. I love listening to you.

307
00:20:28,568 --> 00:20:31,369
I hate living with you,
but your conversation is first-class.

308
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:32,870
This is your room.

309
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,870
I do not clean or make beds.

310
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:40,770
You may use the kitchen
or the bathroom when I am not in it...

311
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:42,969
...and wash it up when you are through!

312
00:20:43,069 --> 00:20:47,270
You pay for your own food,
laundry, linens and phone bills.

313
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:50,969
I would appreciate some quiet
between 6:00 and 9:00...

314
00:20:51,069 --> 00:20:53,269
...as that is when Lucy does her homework.

315
00:20:53,369 --> 00:20:55,569
I don't care what you drink or smoke...

316
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,269
...as long as it is not grass
in front of my 10-year-old daughter.

317
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,070
- Do we have everything straight?
- No!

318
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:05,469
- No?
- I'm not crazy about the arrangements.

319
00:21:05,569 --> 00:21:06,869
- You're not?
- Definitely not!

320
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:09,469
I'm paying the rent. I'll make the rules.

321
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:14,070
I like to take showers every morning
and I don't like panties drying on the rod!

322
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:17,669
I like to cook, so I'll use the kitchen
whenever I damn well please.

323
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:21,669
I'm very particular about my condiments,
so keep your salt and pepper to yourself!

324
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:24,969
I play the guitar in the middle of the night
when I can't sleep.

325
00:21:25,069 --> 00:21:28,169
I meditate every morning
with chanting and burning incense...

326
00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:30,869
...so if you must walk around
I'd appreciate tiptoeing.

327
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:34,571
Also, I sleep in the nude, a-buff-o...

328
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:38,471
...winter and summer, rain or snow,
with the windows open.

329
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,570
Because I may have to go to the potty
or the fridge in the middle of the night...

330
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,170
...and because I don't want to put on
jammies, which I don't own anyway...

331
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,070
...unless you want a thrill,
or your girl an advanced education...

332
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,270
...l'd keep my door closed.

333
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:53,070
Them's my rules and regulations.
How does that grab you?

334
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:55,470
- If I say no?
- I got a lawyer acquaintance downtown!

335
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,170
- I accept!
- We're movin' along.

336
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:59,470
I don't like it and I don't think I like you!

337
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,970
- 'Cause I'm an actor?
- Coupled with your personality.

338
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:05,670
That's probably why we were
thrown together. One of God's little jests!

339
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,770
Now if you'll move your shapely little fanny
out of my room...

340
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,871
...l'll unpack and dry my beard.

341
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,671
- You forgot to say good night.
- I was working on goodbye.

342
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,771
Unbelievable!

343
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,671
How long is he gonna stay?

344
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,371
As long as he lets us.

345
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:28,170
- Go to the bathroom.
- I don't have to go now.

346
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,971
Then save it till morning.

347
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:34,071
It's not safe out there.

348
00:22:39,471 --> 00:22:40,672
Good night.

349
00:22:41,471 --> 00:22:42,472
No kiss?

350
00:22:42,671 --> 00:22:45,172
I'm angry. I don't want to lose it!

351
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:04,172
Christ!

352
00:23:05,971 --> 00:23:08,771
Listen to that. Did that guitar wake you?

353
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,372
No, you did.

354
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:13,472
Sorry.

355
00:23:14,671 --> 00:23:17,372
Is he gonna play that thing all night?

356
00:23:18,371 --> 00:23:21,672
- Put a pillow over your ear.
- I'll smother.

357
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:24,672
It's better than that guitar.

358
00:23:32,571 --> 00:23:33,671
Who is it?

359
00:23:33,771 --> 00:23:36,571
- Very funny. May I come in?
- Door's open.

360
00:23:36,671 --> 00:23:38,672
- Are you decent?
- I am decent.

361
00:23:39,071 --> 00:23:42,371
Do you realize it is 3:00 in the morning
and my daughter...

362
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:44,573
Jesus Christ, you're naked!

363
00:23:45,972 --> 00:23:47,772
I thought you said you were decent.

364
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:50,673
I am decent! I also happen to be naked.

365
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:57,172
Mr. Garfield, I have
a growing daughter inside...

366
00:23:57,272 --> 00:23:59,772
...who won't grow
on two hours of sleep a night.

367
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,072
Do you have to play that thing at this hour?

368
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:03,972
I told you it helps me fall asleep.

369
00:24:04,072 --> 00:24:07,872
- Have you ever tried pills?
- I don't know how to play "pills."

370
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:10,572
It's not hard!
You pop them in your mouth and swallow.

371
00:24:10,672 --> 00:24:14,572
I am a person of health.
I do not put unnatural things in my body.

372
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:16,872
Music is one of nature's sedatives.

373
00:24:16,972 --> 00:24:20,672
If you'll listen instead of fighting it,
we'd all be asleep in five minutes.

374
00:24:20,772 --> 00:24:23,573
However, if you insist,
take two sleeping pills...

375
00:24:23,972 --> 00:24:25,973
...and stick one in each ear.

376
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,573
He won't stop!

377
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:36,173
I have a lawyer acquaintance, too, I can get.

378
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:42,773
Just take deep breaths, count to 100.

379
00:24:46,172 --> 00:24:47,874
I'm sorry, baby.

380
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:54,574
I'm really sorry I got you
in the middle of all this mess.

381
00:25:17,673 --> 00:25:19,074
What's that?

382
00:25:20,973 --> 00:25:22,874
Sounds like God.

383
00:25:30,273 --> 00:25:31,574
5:55.

384
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:34,074
Boy, does God get up early!

385
00:25:37,373 --> 00:25:39,274
I smell strawberries burning.

386
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:41,273
That is incense.

387
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,574
What's incense?

388
00:25:42,773 --> 00:25:45,274
It is what I am feeling right now.

389
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:09,475
You know it's 5:55...

390
00:26:12,574 --> 00:26:13,975
...in the morning?

391
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,875
Isn't there a church where you could do that?

392
00:26:36,274 --> 00:26:38,675
You finished? Is that the last chorus?

393
00:26:39,174 --> 00:26:42,275
I am in a blissful state, so don't bug me.

394
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:45,274
Is this going to be a regular routine?

395
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:47,474
Guitars at night, humming in the morning?

396
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:50,375
I've been in musicals
that didn't have that much music.

397
00:26:53,874 --> 00:26:57,676
This morning I start rehearsals
for my first New York play.

398
00:26:58,475 --> 00:27:01,476
Probably the most important day of my life.

399
00:27:01,975 --> 00:27:03,376
Am I nervous?

400
00:27:03,975 --> 00:27:05,476
No, I'm not nervous.

401
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:09,976
Because I have meditated, I am relaxed...

402
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:11,776
...I am calm...

403
00:27:12,775 --> 00:27:14,276
...I am confident.

404
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:18,276
You, on the other hand, have not meditated.

405
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:22,076
Therefore, you are a pain in the ass.

406
00:27:28,575 --> 00:27:33,176
Today happens to be a very important day
for me, too.

407
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:37,576
I am auditioning for a new musical
this morning.

408
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:41,676
I slept 17 minutes last night,
thanks to you...

409
00:27:42,275 --> 00:27:46,675
...and with the bags I have under my eyes,
unless it is about little old ladies...

410
00:27:46,775 --> 00:27:49,076
...I don't have a chance in hell.

411
00:27:49,475 --> 00:27:51,376
Are you listening to me?

412
00:27:52,375 --> 00:27:54,975
What is that slop
you are putting in my dishes?

413
00:27:55,075 --> 00:27:58,676
Granola, wheat germ, soya,
lecithin, natural honey.

414
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,976
My body is a temple, and I am worshipping it.

415
00:28:02,076 --> 00:28:05,876
It's what gives me my energy, my vitality,
and my natural disposition.

416
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:08,477
I'm 63 years old, and look at me.

417
00:28:08,776 --> 00:28:10,277
Can I fix you a bowl?

418
00:28:10,876 --> 00:28:12,876
This isn't going to work.

419
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:16,476
I really don't know you well enough
to truly dislike you...

420
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:19,076
...but you are just too weird to live with.

421
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:21,276
Why don't you try to find another place...

422
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,276
...and I'll pay you the $600
as soon as I get a job?

423
00:28:24,376 --> 00:28:26,476
You're forgetting that this is my apartment.

424
00:28:26,576 --> 00:28:29,377
You're living here
on an Elliot Garfield grant.

425
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:32,876
You ought to try this.
It's got whole bran in it.

426
00:28:32,976 --> 00:28:36,277
My feeling is your whole problem
stems from irregularity.

427
00:28:38,676 --> 00:28:42,677
Okay, let's take it from the top.
Up the tempo, performance level, please.

428
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:18,178
Paula?

429
00:29:19,977 --> 00:29:23,378
Oh, my God. You scared me!
I thought it was my turn.

430
00:29:27,877 --> 00:29:31,177
Thank you. The boy in the gray slacks,
the girl in the green socks...

431
00:29:31,277 --> 00:29:33,177
...and the girl in the red scarf, please.

432
00:29:33,277 --> 00:29:37,378
Fred, Valarie and Darina, please wait.
The rest of you, thank you very much.

433
00:29:37,777 --> 00:29:40,077
- How you feel?
- So old.

434
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:42,577
I saw a girl before who goes
to Lucy's school.

435
00:29:42,677 --> 00:29:45,477
Paul Keiser, Don Wallace, Cynthia Robbins...

436
00:29:45,577 --> 00:29:48,077
...Carla Williams, Susan Weinstein,
Donna Douglas...

437
00:29:48,177 --> 00:29:50,578
...and Paula McFadden, onstage, please!

438
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:53,778
- Think positive!
- Mention it to my legs.

439
00:29:55,477 --> 00:29:57,978
Two rows, please, the girls in the front.

440
00:29:58,277 --> 00:30:00,078
Paula, is that you?

441
00:30:00,277 --> 00:30:02,078
- Yes.
- Ronnie Burns.

442
00:30:02,377 --> 00:30:04,278
Ronnie! Hello!

443
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:06,777
I thought you gave all of this up.

444
00:30:06,877 --> 00:30:09,978
I did. I just picked the wrong one
to give it up for.

445
00:30:10,477 --> 00:30:11,878
You been keepin' in shape?

446
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:12,978
Yes, terrific.

447
00:30:13,078 --> 00:30:16,379
- You want to show me?
- Not unless I can take a written test.

448
00:30:16,578 --> 00:30:17,878
Okay, Eddie.

449
00:30:17,978 --> 00:30:21,078
Just a few basic, impossible steps, kids,
so pay attention.

450
00:30:21,178 --> 00:30:25,179
I'll give you the counts first.
Five, six, seven, eight.

451
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:27,879
One, two, three, four, touch, drag.

452
00:30:39,978 --> 00:30:43,379
From the top. Up to tempo,
performance level, please!

453
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,679
Just a minute, please.

454
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:20,979
Robert DeLurie and Cynthia Robbins,
please wait.

455
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:24,480
The rest of you, thank you very much
for coming in.

456
00:31:25,579 --> 00:31:27,680
A little rusty, Paula, but not bad.

457
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:31,079
My problem is I need 'em very young.

458
00:31:31,179 --> 00:31:33,880
Young? Okay I'll work on it.

459
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:36,480
The next group, onstage please!

460
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,980
Now, what about Richard? The question is...

461
00:31:41,379 --> 00:31:45,580
...and this may seem perfunctory,
was Richard actually deformed?

462
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:49,980
Historically, we know he was born
with severe curvature of the spine...

463
00:31:50,179 --> 00:31:52,979
...thus giving the impression
that he was hunchbacked.

464
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,079
There was some paralysis
of the left hand and right foot...

465
00:31:56,179 --> 00:31:59,979
...Olivier chose to play the right hand
and left foot, God knows why...

466
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:03,079
...as well as nerve damage
to the right cheek and eyelids.

467
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:06,180
The man was your basic gimp! Let's face it.

468
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:10,779
All of which brings us, bless the wise
and rich Mrs. Estelle Morganweiss...

469
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:12,580
...to this production.

470
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,679
Is that the way we want to play Richard?

471
00:32:17,779 --> 00:32:20,279
If you do, then this director
would just as soon...

472
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,381
...do a six-week stint
on the Sonny and Cher Show.

473
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:27,380
Richard III was a flaming homosexual.

474
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,380
So was Shakespeare, for that matter...

475
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:33,180
...but the angry mob at the Globe Theatre
wasn't going to pay two shillings...

476
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,681
...to see a bunch of pansies
jumping about on the stage.

477
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:41,181
It was society that crippled Richard,
not childbirth.

478
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,181
Read your text.

479
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,780
He sent those two little boys
up to the tower...

480
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,880
...and nobody ever saw them again.

481
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,580
We know why, don't we?

482
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,981
What I want to do here is to strip
Richard bare, metaphorically.

483
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,380
Let's get rid of the hump.

484
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,881
Let's get rid of the twisted extremities
and show him the way he would be today.

485
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:04,081
The Queen who wanted to be King!

486
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,481
- Yes?
- Question.

487
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,780
Are you serious?

488
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,781
What's the objection, Elliot?

489
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,180
Number one, I have to play it.

490
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,881
Number two, I like the hump and the clubfoot.

491
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,180
Number three, I've been workin'
on the part for months.

492
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,581
I respect that.

493
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,981
That's why we're here, isn't it?
To exchange ideas.

494
00:33:25,681 --> 00:33:29,482
Tell me, how do you see Richard?
Mr. Macho? Is that it?

495
00:33:31,381 --> 00:33:34,881
I don't think the guy is a linebacker
for the Chicago Bears...

496
00:33:34,981 --> 00:33:38,281
...but let's not throw away
one of his prime motivations.

497
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:39,481
What's that?

498
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:41,682
He wants to hump Lady Anne!

499
00:33:41,981 --> 00:33:43,781
Yes, I've heard that before.

500
00:33:43,881 --> 00:33:46,882
I don't want to pressure you.
Let's just try it my way.

501
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:49,481
Let's read through the first act.

502
00:33:49,581 --> 00:33:51,382
Please, trust me.

503
00:33:59,281 --> 00:34:00,481
Act 1.

504
00:34:00,581 --> 00:34:02,382
- Scene 1.
- Excuse me!

505
00:34:06,481 --> 00:34:09,381
Just how far off the diving board
do you want me to jump?

506
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:13,582
Don't give me Bette Midler
but let's not be afraid to be bold.

507
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:15,982
- Bold?
- Bold.

508
00:34:19,981 --> 00:34:21,782
"Act 1, Scene 1.

509
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:24,682
"Enter Richard, Duke of Gloucester."

510
00:34:28,881 --> 00:34:31,483
"Now is the winter of our discontent Made..."

511
00:34:31,682 --> 00:34:34,283
Sorry. Excuse me. One second.

512
00:34:42,782 --> 00:34:44,383
"Now is the winter...

513
00:34:56,682 --> 00:35:00,983
"Now is the winter of our discontent..."
May I have a five-minute break, please?

514
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:02,883
Five minutes!

515
00:35:03,082 --> 00:35:05,283
Five-minute break, everybody!

516
00:35:11,582 --> 00:35:15,283
Thirty-nine. Oh, my God.

517
00:35:19,482 --> 00:35:20,483
Forty.

518
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:24,783
That's all? I can't do anymore.

519
00:35:25,482 --> 00:35:27,883
60! You said 60!

520
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:31,683
No, the muscles are gone! I can't dance!

521
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,083
It was a dumb idea.

522
00:35:34,983 --> 00:35:37,284
I am going to put you up for adoption.

523
00:35:38,683 --> 00:35:40,484
Get your old mother a Coke.

524
00:35:41,183 --> 00:35:42,384
Fattening.

525
00:35:44,883 --> 00:35:46,484
Get me the Coke.

526
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:49,783
Mother doesn't want
to beat the crap out of you.

527
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:51,284
No willpower!

528
00:35:56,383 --> 00:35:57,484
I've died.

529
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,084
I've truly died.

530
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:04,184
Enter, sweet Anne.

531
00:36:06,183 --> 00:36:08,283
- You live alone?
- Yeah!

532
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:11,383
Fortunately, the other people who live here
also live alone.

533
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:13,384
Let me take your coat.

534
00:36:14,883 --> 00:36:15,984
Thanks.

535
00:36:20,483 --> 00:36:22,283
Hey, Lucy, this is Rhonda.

536
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:24,184
Rhonda, Lucy. Lucy, Rhonda.

537
00:36:24,583 --> 00:36:25,784
- Hello.
- Hi.

538
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,584
What are you doin'?

539
00:36:27,983 --> 00:36:29,484
Sitting on my mother.

540
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,583
Sounds like fun. You want to keep it down?

541
00:36:32,683 --> 00:36:35,383
Rhonda and I will be workin'
in my bedroom. See you later.

542
00:36:35,483 --> 00:36:37,184
- Good night.
- Good night.

543
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:48,385
I'll bet.

544
00:36:50,984 --> 00:36:53,285
I heard voices. Was that him?

545
00:36:54,784 --> 00:36:55,984
He took two apples.

546
00:36:56,084 --> 00:36:58,885
- Did you write it down?
- I didn't have a pencil.

547
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:01,985
I told you, write everything down.

548
00:37:02,184 --> 00:37:06,585
If he takes a glass of water, write it down.
We're not running a hotel.

549
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:08,985
Why don't you like him?

550
00:37:09,684 --> 00:37:12,584
Who invited him? That's why I don't like him.

551
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:16,084
If he were a lawyer or a doctor
instead of an actor, would you like him?

552
00:37:16,184 --> 00:37:18,385
I wouldn't like him if I liked him.

553
00:37:18,884 --> 00:37:20,885
He grates on me.

554
00:37:21,784 --> 00:37:23,284
I think he's kind of cute.

555
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:25,484
He reminds me of a dog that nobody wants.

556
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:27,985
You are never to think he's cute, never.

557
00:37:28,784 --> 00:37:30,384
Why'd he want two apples?

558
00:37:30,484 --> 00:37:32,185
One for him, one for her.

559
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:34,684
What her?

560
00:37:34,784 --> 00:37:36,684
He's got a girl in there.

561
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:41,584
In my house! A girl in the bedroom?
Why didn't you say something?

562
00:37:41,684 --> 00:37:44,486
I'm sorry. You want me
to write girls down, too?

563
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:54,285
- You knocked?
- Can I talk to you in private?

564
00:37:54,385 --> 00:37:57,186
It's a bad time. How about at breakfast?

565
00:37:58,285 --> 00:38:00,186
Is that a girl in there?

566
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:02,185
I certainly hope so.

567
00:38:02,285 --> 00:38:04,885
Not in my house.
I won't put up with this sort of thing.

568
00:38:04,985 --> 00:38:06,085
What sort of thing?

569
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:08,485
You have a girl in your room
and I don't object.

570
00:38:08,585 --> 00:38:11,685
This is Paula McFadden.
Mac lives just down the bedroom apiece.

571
00:38:11,785 --> 00:38:14,885
Mac, this is Rhonda Fontana,
a gifted and rising young actress.

572
00:38:14,985 --> 00:38:16,085
Don't rise.

573
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,886
- Hi.
- Hello.

574
00:38:18,985 --> 00:38:21,286
Can we talk? This is serious.

575
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,486
Take a break!

576
00:38:28,585 --> 00:38:29,385
- Out!
- Out?

577
00:38:29,485 --> 00:38:32,285
Her, out! They have motels
for that sort of activity.

578
00:38:32,385 --> 00:38:34,585
I have an impressionable
10-year-old daughter...

579
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:37,585
...and this isn't one of the impressions
I want her picking up.

580
00:38:37,685 --> 00:38:42,286
Now you get that "rising young actress"
the hell out of there!

581
00:38:42,485 --> 00:38:45,685
Out of where? Out of
my rented apartment you're staying in...

582
00:38:45,785 --> 00:38:47,685
...out of the goodness of my heart?

583
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:50,286
I will bring home anyone
or anything I choose...

584
00:38:50,386 --> 00:38:53,086
...including a one-eyed
Episcopalian kangaroo...

585
00:38:53,186 --> 00:38:55,786
...if that happens to be
my kinky inclination.

586
00:38:55,886 --> 00:38:59,386
As for what's going on, we're rehearsing
Act 1, Scene 4 of Richard III.

587
00:38:59,486 --> 00:39:03,186
I have a cretin from Mars directing the play
and I need all the help I can get.

588
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:07,186
However, if I choose to attempt to have
carnal knowledge of that gorgeous bod...

589
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:10,487
...that'll be her option, my problem,
and none of your business.

590
00:39:11,686 --> 00:39:14,886
What do you think was Lucy's impression
of what was going on...

591
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,587
...in Momma's bedroom with
Tony "love 'em and leave 'em" DeForrest?

592
00:39:20,186 --> 00:39:24,287
Why don't you turn off some of the lights?
We're runnin' up a heck of a bill.

593
00:39:32,386 --> 00:39:33,387
You okay?

594
00:39:33,986 --> 00:39:35,887
I'm fine. Let's go to sleep.

595
00:39:38,586 --> 00:39:41,286
Are you upset because
they're messing around in there?

596
00:39:41,386 --> 00:39:42,986
They are not messing around.

597
00:39:43,086 --> 00:39:46,287
They are doing Act 1, Scene 4
from Richard III.

598
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:53,988
Did it ever bother you about Tony and me?

599
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:57,288
I mean, not being married
and living together?

600
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:58,588
No.

601
00:39:59,387 --> 00:40:02,788
I wanted to get married.
He couldn't get a divorce.

602
00:40:03,287 --> 00:40:04,588
That's okay.

603
00:40:06,587 --> 00:40:09,188
I just wanted to know how you felt.

604
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:13,588
Socks in the hamper, please.

605
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:22,588
Is that song from Richard III?

606
00:40:23,387 --> 00:40:25,288
Let's brush our teeth.

607
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:30,388
Oh, God, please let me be hit by...

608
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:32,988
...a rich man in a Rolls-Royce.

609
00:40:33,287 --> 00:40:35,088
I think I can swing that.

610
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:36,588
Thank you.

611
00:40:37,787 --> 00:40:41,188
No, I mean it.
It's funny you should say that.

612
00:40:41,487 --> 00:40:42,888
What did I say?

613
00:40:43,087 --> 00:40:46,087
There's an outside chance
that I can get us both a job...

614
00:40:46,187 --> 00:40:48,487
...at the Auto Show at the coliseum.

615
00:40:48,587 --> 00:40:51,688
It's only two weeks but the money's not bad.

616
00:40:52,787 --> 00:40:55,587
Any money's not bad. What do we have to do?

617
00:40:55,687 --> 00:40:59,189
Just look pretty, point to the cars
and say, "terrific."

618
00:40:59,388 --> 00:41:03,389
I can do that. I can point
and say, "terrific."

619
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:07,388
This friend's going to let me know
this weekend.

620
00:41:07,488 --> 00:41:09,689
Just keep it a little quiet.

621
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:13,689
What a nice person you are.
You didn't have to tell me.

622
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:15,789
I feel kind of related.

623
00:41:16,788 --> 00:41:18,889
I lived with Bobby all last year.

624
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:20,589
Bobby who?

625
00:41:21,288 --> 00:41:23,289
Bobby Kulick, your ex-husband!

626
00:41:24,088 --> 00:41:26,989
Oh, Bobby. The marriage slipped my mind.

627
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,388
"...as you are weary of the weight,

628
00:41:32,488 --> 00:41:35,889
"Rest you, whiles I lament
King Henry's corse.

629
00:41:36,388 --> 00:41:39,588
"Stay, you that bear the corse,
and set it down.

630
00:41:39,688 --> 00:41:42,589
"What black magician conjures up this fiend,

631
00:41:42,788 --> 00:41:44,888
"To stop devoted charitable deeds?

632
00:41:44,988 --> 00:41:47,288
"My lord, stand back,
and let the coffin pass.

633
00:41:47,388 --> 00:41:50,689
"Unmanner'd dog! Stand thou, when I command:

634
00:41:51,088 --> 00:41:53,288
"Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,

635
00:41:53,388 --> 00:41:55,888
"Or, by Saint Paul,
I'll strike thee to my foot..."

636
00:41:55,988 --> 00:41:59,788
My careereth is over.
I am making a horseth asseth of myselfeth!

637
00:41:59,888 --> 00:42:01,789
- What?
- Mark, I'm begging you!

638
00:42:02,989 --> 00:42:05,989
You want this kind of performance,
let me play Lady Anne.

639
00:42:06,089 --> 00:42:08,890
All right, let's take five, everyone!
Five minutes.

640
00:42:19,889 --> 00:42:21,890
You're unhappy, Elliot?

641
00:42:25,189 --> 00:42:27,490
Unhappy? No.

642
00:42:29,489 --> 00:42:33,490
I am freaking petrified.
The critics are going to crucify me, Mark...

643
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:38,890
...and gay liberation's gonna hang me
from Shakespeare's statue by my genitalia!

644
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,589
You gotta help me, Mark!

645
00:42:40,689 --> 00:42:43,089
- What do you want, Elliot?
- I want my hump back!

646
00:42:43,189 --> 00:42:45,290
I want my clubfoot!

647
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:48,289
I want a little paralysis in my right hand.

648
00:42:48,389 --> 00:42:52,390
I don't mean a lot, just a little.
Two stiff fingers, a little motivation.

649
00:42:52,589 --> 00:42:55,490
I see. You want to play it safe.

650
00:42:56,389 --> 00:42:59,189
You want to give us your standard,
conventional Richard.

651
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:00,689
I can't argue with that.

652
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:03,189
They've been doing it that way for 400 years.

653
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:06,390
What do I know?
I'm lucky to get the part! I know that.

654
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:10,490
I come from Chicago!
We do things a little differently there.

655
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:14,591
We do the play as written.
That doesn't go over in New York. Terrific.

656
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:21,091
I respect you, Mark. I do.
You've done off-Broadway, I haven't.

657
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:24,791
I'm not a quitter.

658
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:28,190
You want me to do Richard III
like Tatum O'Neal, I'll do it.

659
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:30,390
Just don't let me look foolish out there.

660
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:31,490
You feel foolish?

661
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:34,991
I feel like an asshole!
I passed foolish on Tuesday.

662
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,191
- We have to trust each other, Elliot.
- I do.

663
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:45,290
- I was never going to let you do it like that.
- Thank God!

664
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:47,190
But do you see where I'm heading?

665
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:48,891
I'm trying, Mark.

666
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,891
Richard was gay, there's no doubt about it.

667
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,191
Let's use that as subtext.

668
00:43:54,390 --> 00:43:57,590
We'll keep it, but now we can put back
the hump and the clubfoot.

669
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,690
- And the twisted fingers?
- If you like.

670
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,290
I love 'em. I'm crazy about 'em!

671
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,991
Then use them, baby,
and you'll see what I'm after.

672
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,191
Just try it my way.
I will never let you go wrong.

673
00:44:18,791 --> 00:44:20,691
Haven't we met in our apartment?

674
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:24,491
Please. I enjoy shopping.
Don't ruin this for me, too.

675
00:44:24,591 --> 00:44:27,392
Relax. We don't have to fight
until we get home.

676
00:44:30,191 --> 00:44:32,891
- We need soap, darling.
- Not in my bathroom, you don't.

677
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:36,291
This is silly. If you get what you need
and I get what I need...

678
00:44:36,391 --> 00:44:39,991
...we'll blow a lot of bread
gettin' the same things, including bread.

679
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:42,991
Why don't we have one shopping list
and split the bill?

680
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:43,991
On what items?

681
00:44:44,091 --> 00:44:47,592
Food! Bathroom and kitchen cleansers,
everything...

682
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:49,591
...except male and female doodads.

683
00:44:49,691 --> 00:44:51,891
In that area, you go your way
and I go my way.

684
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:53,091
We split everything?

685
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,391
Everything. I'll pay my full one-third share.

686
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:57,891
- One third?
- I'm not the one with the daughter.

687
00:44:57,991 --> 00:45:00,591
Didn't Lady Anne wash her hands
the other night?

688
00:45:00,691 --> 00:45:04,492
Quick. I like a quick girl.
Okay, right down the middle.

689
00:45:06,991 --> 00:45:07,992
Okay.

690
00:45:13,591 --> 00:45:15,992
Hold it! I'll take care of that.

691
00:45:19,692 --> 00:45:23,092
Good idea, sharing expenses.
By the way, I need shoes next week.

692
00:45:23,192 --> 00:45:26,892
A little Chianti? Can't have
Spaghetti Marinara without a little vino.

693
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:29,492
- You can on my budget.
- I'll blow for the booze.

694
00:45:29,592 --> 00:45:32,893
Short of stature but not tight of pocket.
I'll be right out.

695
00:45:36,092 --> 00:45:39,092
A bottle of your finest cheap Chianti,
please.

696
00:45:39,192 --> 00:45:41,693
I have a nice California red for $1.80.

697
00:45:42,092 --> 00:45:43,292
- $1.80?
- Right.

698
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:44,893
Nothing from Kansas?

699
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:48,293
No, seriously, this is a nice red.

700
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:51,692
- This goes with spaghetti?
- Perfect with spaghetti.

701
00:45:51,792 --> 00:45:53,892
Thank you. It's under $2.00, right?

702
00:45:53,992 --> 00:45:57,193
Yeah, $1.80 is pretty much under $2.00,
as far as I know.

703
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:00,993
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you very much.

704
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:03,193
Appreciate it.

705
00:46:03,592 --> 00:46:05,193
Take care. What the...

706
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:07,292
They took my bag! They took my bag!

707
00:46:07,392 --> 00:46:08,493
What? Who?

708
00:46:08,792 --> 00:46:11,192
In the car. They grabbed my bag.

709
00:46:11,292 --> 00:46:12,592
Jumped out and grabbed it!

710
00:46:12,692 --> 00:46:15,092
- It had everything in it!
- Those dirty bastards!

711
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:16,892
Aren't you gonna go after them?

712
00:46:16,992 --> 00:46:18,793
After a speeding car?

713
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:21,994
Thanks a lot!

714
00:46:22,293 --> 00:46:24,093
But they could be armed!

715
00:46:24,193 --> 00:46:26,893
Do you want me to fight
with a can of tomato paste?

716
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:29,394
Just leave me alone!

717
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:40,193
I think you ought to call the police
and report it. I could call 'em for you.

718
00:46:40,293 --> 00:46:42,693
I wish you were that helpful
while I was being robbed!

719
00:46:42,793 --> 00:46:46,094
What do you want from me anyway?
I'm not a German Shepherd.

720
00:46:46,693 --> 00:46:48,193
Oh, my God, it's them!

721
00:46:48,293 --> 00:46:50,993
- Who?
- The ones who took my bag! Stop!

722
00:46:51,093 --> 00:46:52,494
Where are you going?

723
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:58,294
What is this, Police Woman?
Get out of the way!

724
00:46:58,493 --> 00:47:01,094
I'm gonna get a bullet
between my goddamn eyes!

725
00:47:02,093 --> 00:47:05,194
Somebody, stop those men!

726
00:47:08,693 --> 00:47:09,494
Wait!

727
00:47:13,893 --> 00:47:16,293
Give me the bag! I'm not afraid of you guys!

728
00:47:16,393 --> 00:47:18,594
Get out of the car!

729
00:47:23,093 --> 00:47:24,994
I was just askin'.

730
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:26,995
Relax!

731
00:47:28,794 --> 00:47:30,595
Just a simple question...

732
00:47:43,394 --> 00:47:45,095
Thank you very much.

733
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:03,595
I had all my money in there.

734
00:48:05,394 --> 00:48:06,495
Everything.

735
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:10,095
My last dollar in the world.

736
00:48:12,294 --> 00:48:14,395
You and your goddamn Chianti.

737
00:48:15,294 --> 00:48:17,294
What does Chianti have to do with it?

738
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,694
Why can't you at least thank me
for risking my life for you?

739
00:48:20,794 --> 00:48:23,195
Did you get me my bag back? No.

740
00:48:23,794 --> 00:48:25,995
So why should I thank you?

741
00:48:27,294 --> 00:48:31,395
Why do I have such lousy luck
every time an actor comes into my life?

742
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,296
I hate all of you.

743
00:48:36,595 --> 00:48:37,896
Get away from me!

744
00:48:38,595 --> 00:48:39,896
Just get away.

745
00:48:43,395 --> 00:48:46,596
I really don't think they robbed you
'cause I'm an actor.

746
00:48:53,795 --> 00:48:57,495
After I graduated from Northwestern,
my first summer job was in Lake Michigan.

747
00:48:57,595 --> 00:49:00,495
I did ten plays in ten weeks.
I really worked like a dog.

748
00:49:00,595 --> 00:49:02,695
I had hepatitis and mumps and never knew it.

749
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:05,396
I thought I was just getting yellow and fat.

750
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:08,396
Which plays?

751
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,495
First play was Inherit the Wind.
I played the reporter.

752
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:12,995
Gene Kelly did in the movie.

753
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:15,395
Right. Very good.
He did a very nice job, too.

754
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:16,995
He didn't dig as deeply as I did.

755
00:49:17,095 --> 00:49:18,996
Next I did Cyrano de Bergerac.

756
00:49:19,195 --> 00:49:21,795
José Ferrer. I saw it last week on Channel 9.

757
00:49:21,895 --> 00:49:23,895
I used half the nose, got twice the laughs.

758
00:49:23,995 --> 00:49:26,495
It's style that counts, darling,
it is not makeup.

759
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:28,895
You don't think much of yourself, do you?

760
00:49:28,995 --> 00:49:31,795
Pound for pound, I got the biggest ego
this side of St. Louis.

761
00:49:31,895 --> 00:49:35,197
You gotta see the face
to appreciate the work.

762
00:49:35,996 --> 00:49:39,797
What else? I taught drama for a semester
at Duluth Junior College.

763
00:49:40,196 --> 00:49:43,897
- You taught drama? Far out!
- Very far out. It's up near Canada.

764
00:49:45,496 --> 00:49:47,197
You want some more wine?

765
00:49:48,296 --> 00:49:51,997
- Niente on the Chianti.
- That's good. You're terrific with words.

766
00:49:52,296 --> 00:49:55,496
- You always pick the right ones.
- Words are the canvas of an actor.

767
00:49:55,596 --> 00:49:59,597
His lips are his brushes, and his tongue,
the colors of the spectrum.

768
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:03,497
And when he speaks, he paints portraits.

769
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:06,496
- He's very classy!
- The kid's got a good eye.

770
00:50:06,596 --> 00:50:09,497
Not like Tony. He wasn't a classy actor.

771
00:50:09,996 --> 00:50:13,297
He was just, you know... sexy!

772
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:17,797
You don't think I'm sexy?

773
00:50:19,896 --> 00:50:21,197
Are you kidding?

774
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:23,696
What do you know? You're 10 years old.

775
00:50:23,796 --> 00:50:26,497
In three years,
I'll drive you out of your bird!

776
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:31,397
- It's after 9:00, do your homework.
- Five more minutes!

777
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:35,397
Talk more. We never had a good talkin'
like this at dinner.

778
00:50:37,296 --> 00:50:41,097
Then I played Midsummer Night's Dream
on public television in Chicago.

779
00:50:41,197 --> 00:50:43,297
I played the part Mickey Rooney did
in the movie.

780
00:50:43,397 --> 00:50:44,297
- Puck!
- Right!

781
00:50:44,397 --> 00:50:46,597
A lady producer from New York called me...

782
00:50:46,697 --> 00:50:50,397
...and asked me to come to New York
and play Richard III off-Broadway.

783
00:50:50,497 --> 00:50:53,798
And not off-Broadway,
it's off off off-Broadway.

784
00:50:54,197 --> 00:50:56,297
Are we invited to the opening?

785
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:59,998
Do you really want to come?
The two of you. It's Tuesday night.

786
00:51:00,197 --> 00:51:01,597
Tuesday's a school night.

787
00:51:01,697 --> 00:51:04,198
We went to Tony's opening on a school night.

788
00:51:04,897 --> 00:51:06,198
I said "no."

789
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:08,098
Shit! Shoot!

790
00:51:08,797 --> 00:51:09,898
I'm sorry.

791
00:51:10,297 --> 00:51:12,498
I think I'm in trouble. Good night.

792
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:22,398
Would you be interested in my bedroom?

793
00:51:25,197 --> 00:51:26,297
Talkin' to me?

794
00:51:26,397 --> 00:51:30,198
You can have the big bedroom
for an extra $50 a month.

795
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:34,297
Payable in cash right now.
We'll move into yours in the morning.

796
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:38,797
You mean a rent increase for getting what
I should have gotten in the first place?

797
00:51:38,897 --> 00:51:40,298
No, thank you.

798
00:51:43,697 --> 00:51:45,898
Would you be interested in lending me $50?

799
00:51:45,998 --> 00:51:50,099
I'll either pay you 7.5 percent interest
or do your laundry. Take your pick.

800
00:51:51,698 --> 00:51:53,899
They really cleaned you out?

801
00:51:55,298 --> 00:51:57,499
Everyone from here to Italy.

802
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:14,999
I have $28 in change. I'll split it with you.

803
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:20,699
And starting opening night
I get $240 a week, so I'll make a deal.

804
00:52:21,198 --> 00:52:24,598
I'll pay all the living expenses
until you get yourself a job...

805
00:52:24,698 --> 00:52:26,899
...and I'll even do my own laundry.

806
00:52:29,098 --> 00:52:30,099
I see.

807
00:52:31,698 --> 00:52:33,199
And what do you get?

808
00:52:35,998 --> 00:52:38,399
All you gotta do is be nice to me.

809
00:52:41,898 --> 00:52:43,399
You go to hell!

810
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:55,699
Will you listen very carefully to me?
This may be the last time I talk to you.

811
00:52:55,799 --> 00:52:58,199
Not everyone is after your magnificent body.

812
00:52:58,299 --> 00:53:02,599
In the first place, it's not so magnificent.
It's fair, but it ain't keepin' me up nights.

813
00:53:02,699 --> 00:53:06,099
I don't even think you're very pretty.
Maybe if you smiled...

814
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:08,199
...but don't go against your religion!

815
00:53:08,299 --> 00:53:11,299
And you aren't the only person in this city
to get dumped on!

816
00:53:11,399 --> 00:53:13,299
I myself am a recent dumpee!

817
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,300
I am a dedicated actor, Paula.

818
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:18,699
I am dedicated to my art and my craft.
I value what I do.

819
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:21,699
Because of a mentally arthritic director,
I'm about to play...

820
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:25,399
...the second greatest role in the history
of the English-speaking theatre...

821
00:53:25,499 --> 00:53:28,400
...like a double order
of fresh California fruit salad!

822
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:31,999
When I say "nice," I mean nice!
You know, decent and fair.

823
00:53:32,099 --> 00:53:34,799
I deserve it, 'cause I'm a nice,
decent and fair person.

824
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:36,699
I don't want to jump on your bones!

825
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:39,400
I don't even want to see you in the morning.

826
00:53:40,299 --> 00:53:42,299
I'll tell you what I do like about you.

827
00:53:42,399 --> 00:53:44,599
Lucy! Lucy's your best part!

828
00:53:44,699 --> 00:53:47,000
Lucy is worth puttin' up with you for.

829
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,599
So, here is $14 for the care and feeding
of that terrific kid.

830
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:53,901
You get zip-a-dee-do-dah!

831
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,801
You want any money, borrow it
from your 10-year-old daughter!

832
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,201
I'm now going inside my room to meditate
away my hostility towards you.

833
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,801
Personally, I don't think it can be done!

834
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,901
"And still, as you are weary of the weight,

835
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,101
"Rest you, whiles I lament
King Henry's corse.

836
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:52,401
"Stay, you that bear the corse,
and set it down.

837
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,701
"What black magician conjures up this fiend,

838
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,900
"To stop devoted charitable deeds?

839
00:54:58,001 --> 00:55:00,301
"My lord, stand back,
and let the coffin pass.

840
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:03,101
"Unmanner'd dog! Stand thou when I command:

841
00:55:03,201 --> 00:55:05,201
"Advance the halberd
higher than my breast..."

842
00:55:05,301 --> 00:55:06,702
Good! Good!

843
00:55:08,601 --> 00:55:10,701
"I would they were, that I might die at once;

844
00:55:10,801 --> 00:55:12,901
"For now they kill me with a living death.

845
00:55:13,001 --> 00:55:15,901
"Those eyes of thine from mine

"Shames their aspect

"These eyes, which never shed

00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:23,301
"No, when my father York and Edward wept...

849
00:55:23,401 --> 00:55:26,101
"To hear the piteous moan
that Rutland made..." What is it?

850
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,302
- Am I disturbing you?
- Yes!

851
00:55:28,601 --> 00:55:30,501
- I'm sorry.
- Then don't disturb me!

852
00:55:30,601 --> 00:55:33,801
- You don't have to snap at me.
- I wasn't snapping! I was sarcastic!

853
00:55:33,901 --> 00:55:36,902
Snapping is, "Bug off, I'm busy!"
Get the difference?

854
00:55:38,101 --> 00:55:41,101
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong? Nothing's wrong.

855
00:55:41,201 --> 00:55:43,301
What makes you think something's wrong?

856
00:55:43,401 --> 00:55:47,901
You open Richard III in front of
New York critics, with a chartreuse hump.

857
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:52,202
You play Richard with a crippled, paralytic
hand and pink polish on your nails!

858
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:56,701
I'm trying to figure out how to save
my goddamn career, that's what's wrong!

859
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:58,901
What do you want? No, don't tell me.

860
00:55:59,001 --> 00:56:01,801
I know. I dipped
into your peanut butter, right?

861
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:05,802
How much do I owe you for a finger-full
of chunky Skippy spread?

862
00:56:05,902 --> 00:56:10,303
I just came back to pay you your $14.
I got a job.

863
00:56:11,002 --> 00:56:15,203
And also to ask you if you happen to have
some bicarbonate. Lucy's sick.

864
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:17,102
What's wrong?

865
00:56:17,202 --> 00:56:20,102
She had two double-chocolate sundaes
for dinner.

866
00:56:20,202 --> 00:56:22,103
It's my fault, I ordered them.

867
00:56:23,402 --> 00:56:25,403
You're incredible!

868
00:56:25,602 --> 00:56:28,502
I'm surprised they don't sell
insurance policies to children!

869
00:56:28,602 --> 00:56:31,303
- Is that bicarbonate?
- Don't start with me!

870
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:36,903
How's it feelin', Luc?

871
00:56:37,802 --> 00:56:40,303
- Did you see The Exorcist?
- Yeah.

872
00:56:41,702 --> 00:56:43,602
Then you'd better get out of the room.

873
00:56:43,702 --> 00:56:45,503
You're going to be okay.

874
00:56:50,202 --> 00:56:51,903
Turn over on your back.

875
00:56:56,302 --> 00:56:57,303
Relax.

876
00:56:58,002 --> 00:56:59,702
Come on, don't you trust me?

877
00:56:59,802 --> 00:57:02,903
I trusted my mother today
and look how I feel.

878
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:10,504
I want you to take slow, deep breaths.

879
00:57:14,003 --> 00:57:15,004
Go on.

880
00:57:18,103 --> 00:57:19,004
Now.

881
00:57:23,703 --> 00:57:24,804
That's it.

882
00:57:27,003 --> 00:57:28,104
Watch.

883
00:57:37,403 --> 00:57:39,204
You think you can do this?

884
00:57:39,403 --> 00:57:41,504
I might be able to manage it.

885
00:57:47,503 --> 00:57:48,804
Eyes closed, Luc.

886
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:51,904
Keep breathing deeply.

887
00:57:56,303 --> 00:57:58,004
Deep breath. That's it.

888
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:00,204
How's the play going?

889
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:02,404
One sick person at a time.

890
00:58:06,003 --> 00:58:07,504
Close your eyes.

891
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:16,505
- Feeling any better?
- A little.

892
00:58:18,104 --> 00:58:20,505
Isn't this more soothing than medicine?

893
00:58:21,404 --> 00:58:22,905
It tastes better, too.

894
00:58:26,404 --> 00:58:28,104
Can we go to the opening?

895
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,705
You still owe me a present.
Today was the pits.

896
00:58:34,004 --> 00:58:36,105
Sure. Anything you say.

897
00:58:37,104 --> 00:58:40,405
Terrific. Now you have to get me a dress.

898
00:58:52,104 --> 00:58:53,305
Thank you.

899
00:58:58,704 --> 00:59:00,805
I'm really sorry about yesterday.

900
00:59:02,704 --> 00:59:06,605
It was very generous of you.
I'm not used to the kindness of strangers.

901
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:11,305
I know, don't say it.
Blanche DuBois in Streetcar.

902
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:13,404
Sometimes I feel just like her.

903
00:59:13,504 --> 00:59:17,506
You start to trust a man and they take
you away at the end of the movie.

904
00:59:17,705 --> 00:59:18,806
Anyway...

905
00:59:21,705 --> 00:59:23,406
I'm sorry for...

906
00:59:26,405 --> 00:59:27,906
Well, I'm just sorry.

907
00:59:28,605 --> 00:59:32,406
If you're listening, this is my attempt
at being nice, decent and fair.

908
00:59:33,705 --> 00:59:35,106
How am I doing?

909
00:59:39,005 --> 00:59:40,406
Mr. Garfield?

910
00:59:47,705 --> 00:59:48,706
Wake up.

911
00:59:51,505 --> 00:59:53,606
You can't sleep with my daughter.

912
01:00:04,005 --> 01:00:05,605
Upstairs to the right. Thank you.

913
01:00:05,705 --> 01:00:08,405
I hope this will be funny.
Is it a musical comedy?

914
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:10,606
- It's Shakespeare.
- Boring!

915
01:00:11,405 --> 01:00:13,706
Look at the stubs and find our seats.

916
01:00:14,505 --> 01:00:15,606
Over here.

917
01:00:18,305 --> 01:00:19,106
Wait.

918
01:00:19,405 --> 01:00:23,907
It's so exciting! Wait until you see it.
It is so contemporary and thrilling.

919
01:00:41,506 --> 01:00:44,207
"Now is the winter of our discontent

920
01:00:44,706 --> 01:00:49,707
"Made glorious summer by this sun of York;

921
01:00:51,506 --> 01:00:54,406
"And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our house

922
01:00:54,506 --> 01:00:57,807
"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.

923
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:02,807
"Now are our brows bound
with victorious wreaths;

01:01:04,506 --> 01:01:07,707
"Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;

925
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:12,907
"Our stern alarums changed
to merry meetings,"

926
01:01:15,106 --> 01:01:17,507
Sounds like that guy in the beauty parlor.

927
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:22,207
"Be patient, they are friends...

928
01:01:23,706 --> 01:01:25,007
"...Ratcliff...

01:01:28,307 --> 01:01:29,408
"...and Lovel.

"Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,

"The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.

"That ever breathed

"...wherein my soul recorded
The history of all her secret thoughts:"

01:01:51,307 --> 01:01:52,407
Excuse me, please?

937
01:01:52,507 --> 01:01:53,907
- Is it over?
- It is for me.

"Slave!"

942
01:02:27,007 --> 01:02:28,008
Bravo!

943
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:34,509
But did you really love it?
I mean, really, really love it?

944
01:02:34,708 --> 01:02:36,809
It was very interesting.

945
01:02:37,308 --> 01:02:40,109
Oh, God! Everybody, she loved it!

946
01:02:40,608 --> 01:02:42,109
My mother loved it!

947
01:02:49,208 --> 01:02:51,109
Right through all those people.

948
01:02:51,408 --> 01:02:52,509
Thank you.

949
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:55,409
Thank you. We're all so excited.

950
01:02:57,308 --> 01:02:59,508
I have a feeling he'd rather be alone, Luc.

951
01:02:59,608 --> 01:03:02,408
He'll know we thought it was lousy
if we don't say hello.

952
01:03:02,508 --> 01:03:04,308
All right, but try and be tactful.

953
01:03:04,408 --> 01:03:05,508
What's tactful?

954
01:03:05,608 --> 01:03:06,509
Lie!

955
01:03:09,408 --> 01:03:10,409
Hello!

956
01:03:10,908 --> 01:03:13,309
Mr. Garfield? It's Lucy and me!

957
01:03:15,908 --> 01:03:19,109
We just came back to tell you
how much we enjoyed it.

958
01:03:20,808 --> 01:03:22,309
I had the best time.

959
01:03:22,708 --> 01:03:26,208
At first I thought it would be boring,
but then it picked up near the end.

960
01:03:26,308 --> 01:03:28,709
Okay, Luc. We won't keep you.

961
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:32,608
We just wanted to thank you
for the tickets and a lovely evening.

962
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:34,908
People were talking about you on the way out.

963
01:03:35,008 --> 01:03:38,410
They wanted to remember your name
so they'd never forget it.

964
01:03:41,109 --> 01:03:42,310
Good night.

965
01:03:46,309 --> 01:03:48,210
I thought you were wonderful.

966
01:03:52,709 --> 01:03:53,710
Peter?

967
01:03:54,209 --> 01:03:56,510
You won't believe it.
I think I've got it sold.

968
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:16,110
Are you okay?

969
01:04:17,509 --> 01:04:19,210
God, are you all right?

970
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:21,610
Thou hast broken thy vase.

971
01:04:23,809 --> 01:04:25,210
Thou owest thee...

972
01:04:26,209 --> 01:04:30,010
...$12.98, plus taxes.

973
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:31,710
Are you okay?

974
01:04:32,109 --> 01:04:35,810
Not according to the Times!
Have you read the Times?

975
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:38,310
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

976
01:04:41,310 --> 01:04:42,410
What are you doing?

977
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,011
The Times said:

978
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:48,011
"Elliot Garfield researched Richard III...

01:05:00,510 --> 01:05:01,811
Tasty writing!

982
01:05:02,010 --> 01:05:04,011
I never listen to critics.

983
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:06,211
Thank God.

984
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,911
Do you want to go on for me tomorrow night?

- Oh, God.

Tacky! If you're gonna kill me...

993
01:05:40,010 --> 01:05:42,511
- ...kill me with panache.
- I am really sorry.

It's only a little New York debut, you know?

996
01:05:49,611 --> 01:05:52,512
Ames, Iowa is where it really counts.

997
01:05:54,111 --> 01:05:57,112
You don't make it in Ames,
then you got career trouble.

Oh, my God!

999
01:06:02,611 --> 01:06:04,112
Channel 5 was honest.

1000

I thought you didn't put unhealthy things
into your body.

I don't. I was putting them into Richard's,

01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:47,312
Do you think I'm defeated?
Do you think I'm discouraged?

1010
01:06:47,611 --> 01:06:50,913
Do you think I'm upset
over 14 unimportant, negative reviews?

1011
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:53,813
You bet your ass I am, baby!

1012
01:06:57,212 --> 01:07:00,713
Sorry. This apartment is rated P.G.
I keep forgetting.

1013
01:07:01,212 --> 01:07:03,713
You were wonderful tonight. Really.

1014
01:07:04,112 --> 01:07:07,113
I was an Elizabethan fruit fly.

1015
01:07:08,412 --> 01:07:11,813
I was the Betty Boop of Stratford-on-Avon.

1016
01:07:13,012 --> 01:07:14,213
I was putrid!

1017
01:07:15,012 --> 01:07:19,213
Capital "P", capital "U", capital "Trid!"

1018
01:07:19,812 --> 01:07:22,112
I thought it was
an interesting interpretation.

1019
01:07:22,212 --> 01:07:23,213
Bullshit!

1020
01:07:26,012 --> 01:07:27,813
You didn't see their faces.

1021
01:07:28,012 --> 01:07:29,913
When I walked out onstage...

1022
01:07:31,312 --> 01:07:34,913
...210 people looking like they just got
a shot of Novocaine.

1023
01:07:38,112 --> 01:07:41,213
Tell me the truth. I want the truth, say it!

1024
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:46,212
Say it, or I'll smash this priceless
$9.00 lamp all to pieces!

1025
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,513
Was I putrid or was I not? Say it!

1026
01:07:48,912 --> 01:07:50,613
Yes, you were putrid!

1027
01:07:52,212 --> 01:07:54,614
You don't have to be so blunt about it.

1028
01:07:55,413 --> 01:07:56,514
I'm sorry.

1029
01:07:57,713 --> 01:07:59,014
Give that to me.

1030
01:07:59,313 --> 01:08:00,113
Thank you.

1031
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:03,814
Though I had some good moments now and then.

1032
01:08:04,913 --> 01:08:06,914
Like walking on and walking off.

1033
01:08:08,513 --> 01:08:10,114
The rest was cacca!

1034
01:08:10,513 --> 01:08:12,714
Are you sure I can't get you anything?

1035
01:08:12,913 --> 01:08:16,413
- Some of your health vitamins?
- No, don't walk out on me, please!

1036
01:08:16,513 --> 01:08:18,214
Once a night is enough.

1037
01:08:19,613 --> 01:08:20,714
I'm here.

1038
01:08:22,613 --> 01:08:23,814
I'm listening.

1039
01:08:26,513 --> 01:08:28,614
I can play that part, you know.

1040
01:08:31,213 --> 01:08:33,314
I can play the hump off that guy.

1041
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:38,813
I was better on the bus
coming from Chicago...

1042
01:08:38,913 --> 01:08:41,114
...than I was on that stage tonight.

1043
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:47,814
"Now is the winter of our discontent

1044
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:51,114
"Made glorious summer by this sun of York;

1045
01:08:53,013 --> 01:08:56,113
"And all the clouds
that lour'd upon our house

1046
01:08:56,213 --> 01:08:59,015
"In the deep bosom of the ocean buried"

1047
01:08:59,214 --> 01:09:02,115
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...

1048
01:09:06,614 --> 01:09:08,015
That is good.

1049
01:09:08,814 --> 01:09:11,415
It's wonderful. Honestly.

1050
01:09:11,914 --> 01:09:13,015
Thank you.

1051
01:09:13,214 --> 01:09:14,415
You're welcome.

1052
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:17,215
You're really not
such a bad person after all.

1053
01:09:17,414 --> 01:09:18,515
Thank you.

1054
01:09:18,714 --> 01:09:21,114
But that "putrid" remark really hurt.

1055
01:09:21,214 --> 01:09:22,715
That really got to me.

1056
01:09:23,714 --> 01:09:26,115
I know. I don't know what came over me.

1057
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:30,215
You try and get some sleep now, okay?

1058
01:09:31,214 --> 01:09:33,615
Don't tell Lucy about the Times.

1059
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:35,914
I won't.

1060
01:09:36,014 --> 01:09:37,315
Or the News.

1061
01:09:38,414 --> 01:09:39,615
Or Channel 5.

1062
01:09:40,314 --> 01:09:42,515
Or Channel 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11.

1063
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:44,615
I won't.

1064
01:09:47,914 --> 01:09:50,114
- Try to get some sleep.
- Good night.

1065
01:09:50,214 --> 01:09:51,415
Good night.

1066
01:09:52,714 --> 01:09:54,615
No autographs, please.

1067
01:09:57,514 --> 01:10:00,315
"Now is the winter of our discontent

1068
01:10:02,014 --> 01:10:05,316
"Made glorious summer by this sun of York;"

1069
01:10:10,015 --> 01:10:12,815
"One must always respect
brave and courageous attempts...

1070
01:10:12,915 --> 01:10:16,015
"...to explore Shakespeare
through new and daring concepts...

1071
01:10:16,115 --> 01:10:20,116
"...and even, if you will, irreverence..."

1072
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,815
What's "irreverence"?

1073
01:10:21,915 --> 01:10:23,415
You'll find out.

1074
01:10:23,515 --> 01:10:26,715
"But Garfield and Bodine's Richard III
gives us less than...

1075
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:30,915
"...a summer stock Charley's Aunt, without
the good-natured and inoffensive humor."

1076
01:10:31,015 --> 01:10:32,215
They didn't like it?

1077
01:10:32,315 --> 01:10:35,416
The man has two months to live. He's a cynic.

1078
01:10:37,215 --> 01:10:41,316
Which one of you Scotch-taped my tongue
to the roof of my mouth?

1079
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:49,416
Would you like some coffee?

1080
01:10:50,315 --> 01:10:52,516
Not unless it has some bicarbonate.

1081
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:56,516
Congratulations!

1082
01:11:00,815 --> 01:11:01,816
For what?

1083
01:11:02,915 --> 01:11:04,916
I didn't know what else to say.

1084
01:11:05,715 --> 01:11:08,217
Why do you let your child read pornography?

1085
01:11:08,716 --> 01:11:11,117
You want some puffed rice or Cocoa Puffs?

1086
01:11:13,116 --> 01:11:15,917
Starve a cold, feed a failure, eh?

1087
01:11:17,116 --> 01:11:18,117
Hello.

1088
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,717
Yes, just a minute. It's for you.

1089
01:11:21,216 --> 01:11:23,017
I get the cover of Newsweek?

1090
01:11:24,416 --> 01:11:26,217
Hello. Hi, Harv.

1091
01:11:31,116 --> 01:11:32,417
Yeah, I read 'em.

1092
01:11:36,516 --> 01:11:37,917
I understand.

1093
01:11:39,516 --> 01:11:41,417
All right, I'll see you later.

1094
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:44,516
There you go.

1095
01:11:44,616 --> 01:11:48,116
The minute you think your world's
collapsing, something wonderful happens!

1096
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:48,916
What?

1097
01:11:49,016 --> 01:11:51,917
They closed the show!
I don't have to do it anymore.

1098
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:55,016
- The American theater is saved.
- I'm sorry.

1099
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:58,816
It's all for the best.
Now I'm free to take that other job.

1100
01:11:58,916 --> 01:12:00,817
- What other job?
- I'm looking.

1101
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:03,617
C'mon, Luc, we're late. Get your jacket.

1102
01:12:05,416 --> 01:12:08,616
Listen, did you know that Spencer Tracy
got terrible reviews...

1103
01:12:08,716 --> 01:12:10,816
...the first time he was on Broadway?

1104
01:12:10,916 --> 01:12:12,318
No, he didn't.

1105
01:12:12,617 --> 01:12:14,218
I thought he did.

1106
01:12:17,617 --> 01:12:20,018
You know your daughter has a crush on me?

1107
01:12:20,817 --> 01:12:22,017
I've noticed.

1108
01:12:22,117 --> 01:12:23,918
How do you feel about that, Mom?

1109
01:12:25,417 --> 01:12:27,617
Not to take away from your personal charm...

1110
01:12:27,717 --> 01:12:29,718
...she had one on Tony, too.

1111
01:12:31,117 --> 01:12:32,818
They're fickle at 10.

1112
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:36,018
And at 6 she had one on her father.

1113
01:12:37,217 --> 01:12:39,318
Come on. Wait for me downstairs.

1114
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:40,618
Why?

1115
01:12:40,817 --> 01:12:43,218
Because I'm the mother, that's why.

1116
01:12:50,517 --> 01:12:52,018
What are your plans?

1117
01:12:54,117 --> 01:12:55,717
You mean my immediate plans?

1118
01:12:55,817 --> 01:13:00,718
Well, after breakfast I was contemplating
an aborted suicide attempt...

1119
01:13:01,717 --> 01:13:03,718
...and then think about welfare.

1120
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:10,418
You're not going back to Chicago?

1121
01:13:10,617 --> 01:13:12,818
Chicago? No. Siberia, possibly.

1122
01:13:14,517 --> 01:13:18,619
- Your room is paid for. It belongs to you.
- Thank you.

1123
01:13:18,818 --> 01:13:22,218
If I decide to leave, I'll give you an address.
You can ship it to me.

1124
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:25,319
If you stay, I could use some help with Lucy.

1125
01:13:25,918 --> 01:13:28,919
I won't be back in time to make her dinner.

1126
01:13:29,818 --> 01:13:32,219
- What I'm saying is...
- I accept.

1127
01:13:33,518 --> 01:13:35,418
Good! She has dinner at 6:00.

1128
01:13:35,518 --> 01:13:38,519
There are pork chops in the freezer.
Have a nice day.

1129
01:13:40,018 --> 01:13:41,019
Cute.

1130
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,319
Definitely cute.

1131
01:13:43,718 --> 01:13:45,118
My name is Donna Douglas.

1132
01:13:45,218 --> 01:13:47,818
Welcome to the International Auto Show...

1133
01:13:47,918 --> 01:13:49,618
...and to the Subaru display.

1134
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:52,818
How many of you have wondered
how the U.S. Ski team...

1135
01:13:52,918 --> 01:13:56,818
...those champs of the downhill,
get to the top of those steep hills?

1136
01:13:56,918 --> 01:14:01,218
The Subaru engine gives you
39 miles per gallon in highway driving...

1137
01:14:01,318 --> 01:14:05,718
...and 29 miles per gallon in city driving,
extraordinary performance.

1138
01:14:05,818 --> 01:14:10,219
The SEEC-T is a lean-burn approach
to combustion engines...

1139
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:14,819
...and a spectacular design then eliminates
the need for power and fuel...

1140
01:14:19,118 --> 01:14:20,319
Mommy!

1141
01:14:20,818 --> 01:14:25,620
...eliminates the need for power
and fuel-robbing things.

1142
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:29,220
The Subaru gives great performance
plus better mileage...

1143
01:14:29,619 --> 01:14:31,720
...with less emission from your...

1144
01:14:32,519 --> 01:14:33,720
She's up.

1145
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:39,919
The front window is clearly visible
and was designed for maximum visibility...

1146
01:14:40,019 --> 01:14:44,219
...whether one is looking to the right
or to the left, or straight ahead.

1147
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:47,520
I'm beginning to think
my Richard wasn't that bad.

1148
01:14:47,919 --> 01:14:49,819
- That woman!
- She must be confused!

1149
01:14:49,919 --> 01:14:53,819
The rear window is also designed
for maximum visibility...

1150
01:14:53,919 --> 01:14:56,119
...if one is looking out the back.

1151
01:14:56,219 --> 01:14:59,119
- Gee, that's a problem.
- I'm going to go tell her!

1152
01:14:59,219 --> 01:15:01,820
The tires are optional and attractive...

1153
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:06,620
...and Consumer's Guide says that
the Subaru is a remarkable economy car.

1154
01:15:06,819 --> 01:15:08,520
Thank you very much.

1155
01:15:08,919 --> 01:15:12,620
And now I'd like to introduce you
to the rest of the Subaru line...

1156
01:15:13,319 --> 01:15:15,320
Time out, one minute. Un momento.

1157
01:15:16,819 --> 01:15:20,719
Thanks. I could've gotten fired except
they don't know the English word for it.

1158
01:15:20,819 --> 01:15:21,719
Why are you here?

1159
01:15:21,819 --> 01:15:24,319
You came to see me act,
I thought I'd come see you act.

1160
01:15:24,419 --> 01:15:25,819
I thought you were good.

1161
01:15:25,919 --> 01:15:29,020
One constructive comment. Study!
Learn your lines.

1162
01:15:29,120 --> 01:15:32,220
Next year you'll be ready for bigger parts,
like trucks and tanks.

1163
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,220
- Did you have your dinner?
- No.

1164
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:38,021
No? But it must be after 7:00!
What am I paying you for?

1165
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:39,920
Paying me?

1166
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:43,420
One petrified piece of pork chop
and an aging piece of brown celery...

1167
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:45,120
...doesn't constitute payment.

1168
01:15:45,220 --> 01:15:48,520
Come here. I came to give you the kid.
I'm workin' tonight.

1169
01:15:48,620 --> 01:15:50,320
- He got a job!
- Didn't I say that?

1170
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:52,120
- Acting?
- No, I didn't say that.

1171
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:55,520
In the entertainment field.
I'll be back 2:00 a.m. Don't wait up!

1172
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:59,621
You really look terrific. You're so cute!
I never knew you had a figure.

1173
01:16:00,120 --> 01:16:03,121
The man definitely wears me out!

1174
01:16:03,720 --> 01:16:05,521
He wears me out, too.

1175
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:07,520
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1176
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,920
That girl impressed me very much
with your car.

1177
01:16:10,020 --> 01:16:13,320
I'm in the taxi business
and I'm in the market for an entire fleet.

1178
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:16,920
If you think you can handle it,
I'd like to come back and discuss details.

1179
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:18,220
Hang on to that girl.

1180
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:20,721
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1181
01:16:58,921 --> 01:17:01,022
Erotic acts! Exotic acts!

1182
01:17:02,021 --> 01:17:04,622
See sexy, erotic, beautiful girls!

1183
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:06,221
Sexy girls!

1184
01:17:06,321 --> 01:17:08,921
- What kind of show they got?
- Very dirty! Filthy show!

1185
01:17:09,021 --> 01:17:10,021
Next one in ten minutes.

1186
01:17:10,121 --> 01:17:13,122
- What do they do?
- I don't know! It's too dirty for the help.

1187
01:17:20,921 --> 01:17:22,922
Hey, get out of there! Come on!

1188
01:17:33,321 --> 01:17:34,821
You want to go inside?

1189
01:17:34,921 --> 01:17:36,022
Come inside, quick!

1190
01:17:36,122 --> 01:17:38,523
- What is it?
- There's a drunk onstage!

1191
01:17:41,122 --> 01:17:43,023
Throw that creep out of here!

1192
01:17:47,422 --> 01:17:50,222
I'm the doorman. When he comes down,
I'll open the door.

1193
01:17:50,322 --> 01:17:52,423
You want to get paid, or not?

1194
01:17:53,222 --> 01:17:56,122
Which one of you people
is causing all the trouble here?

1195
01:17:56,222 --> 01:17:58,123
You need any help, big fella?

1196
01:17:59,222 --> 01:18:00,722
Get him out of here!

1197
01:18:00,822 --> 01:18:03,123
Sit down so we can all enjoy the show.

1198
01:18:03,522 --> 01:18:06,323
All I want is a kiss. Just one little kiss.

1199
01:18:06,722 --> 01:18:09,823
I don't even know you
and I don't kiss on the first date.

1200
01:18:11,722 --> 01:18:14,223
They liked us! Get a seat! They liked us!

1201
01:18:14,622 --> 01:18:16,022
Get rid of that bum!

1202
01:18:16,122 --> 01:18:18,123
Come here, you little twerp.

1203
01:18:20,422 --> 01:18:23,122
I'm gonna bust your stupid face!

1204
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:24,722
They don't want to see that!

1205
01:18:24,822 --> 01:18:27,723
You don't want to see the little twerp
get his face...

1206
01:18:32,622 --> 01:18:35,722
Tough crowd. Let's talk this over, okay?

1207
01:18:35,822 --> 01:18:38,823
We'll talk it over. My name's Tony.
What's your name?

1208
01:18:39,122 --> 01:18:41,024
- Earl.
- Earl what?

1209
01:18:41,723 --> 01:18:42,924
Earl this.

1210
01:18:50,123 --> 01:18:52,224
It's my first standing ovation.

1211
01:18:53,723 --> 01:18:56,023
You know what Cynthia Fine said?

1212
01:18:56,123 --> 01:18:57,624
Who is Cynthia Fine?

1213
01:18:58,123 --> 01:19:01,023
The girl in my class with the braces
and the big chest.

1214
01:19:01,123 --> 01:19:05,724
Elliot picked me up from school today
and Cynthia says he's got charisma.

1215
01:19:06,723 --> 01:19:08,423
I looked it up and he does.

1216
01:19:08,523 --> 01:19:10,424
All right, cut it out.

1217
01:19:10,923 --> 01:19:11,923
Cut what out?

1218
01:19:12,023 --> 01:19:14,624
Stop trying to make something between us.

1219
01:19:14,823 --> 01:19:16,923
Me? Cynthia Fine says...

1220
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:18,924
Cynthia Fine, my behind!

1221
01:19:19,123 --> 01:19:20,924
Stop pushing me.

1222
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:22,623
Who's pushing?

1223
01:19:22,723 --> 01:19:25,524
You are. Your fingerprints are
all over my back.

1224
01:19:26,523 --> 01:19:28,824
He's okay, all right?

1225
01:19:29,623 --> 01:19:32,423
Once in a while he even acts
like a regular human being...

1226
01:19:32,523 --> 01:19:36,124
...but stop pushing me
because that man is not my type.

1227
01:19:39,623 --> 01:19:43,623
- I heard that. What did you say?
- If you heard it, why are you asking?

1228
01:19:43,723 --> 01:19:45,325
What did you say?

1229
01:19:46,924 --> 01:19:50,525
I said your type never hangs around
long enough to stay your type.

1230
01:19:51,924 --> 01:19:54,225
That is a rotten thing to say.

1231
01:19:54,524 --> 01:19:57,225
I know. I just felt like saying it.

1232
01:19:59,624 --> 01:20:03,325
Sometimes I can be so goddamn furious
with you...

1233
01:20:03,924 --> 01:20:06,025
That was a stinky thing to do!

1234
01:20:12,724 --> 01:20:14,825
What happened to your eye?

1235
01:20:15,224 --> 01:20:18,625
I used it to stop a fist
from going through my face.

1236
01:20:19,924 --> 01:20:21,225
Oh, my God.

1237
01:20:23,024 --> 01:20:24,825
What kind of meat is this?

1238
01:20:25,424 --> 01:20:28,324
Veal parmesan. It's better than potato salad.

1239
01:20:28,424 --> 01:20:31,525
- Let me put some ice on it.
- I'm out of work again.

1240
01:20:34,424 --> 01:20:36,524
You two have nothing to worry about anymore.

1241
01:20:36,624 --> 01:20:39,024
I've decided that you can stay
as long as you like.

1242
01:20:39,124 --> 01:20:41,025
It's my only hope for survival.

1243
01:20:42,324 --> 01:20:45,025
- Something is bound to turn up.
- You think so?

1244
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,924
Cynthia Fine thinks you've got charisma.

1245
01:20:48,024 --> 01:20:50,226
"Charis" yourself to bed young lady.

1246
01:20:50,925 --> 01:20:52,426
Put that on your eye.

1247
01:20:57,925 --> 01:20:59,826
What do you think I've got?

1248
01:21:01,425 --> 01:21:03,126
Do I "charis" you at all?

1249
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:07,425
I'm not talking about talent-wise, you dig?
Talent-wise, I'm very secure.

1250
01:21:07,525 --> 01:21:11,026
Just appeal-wise, I'm a little shaky.

1251
01:21:13,425 --> 01:21:17,225
Come on, you can tell me. I can take it.
Am I as adorable as I think I am?

1252
01:21:17,325 --> 01:21:20,625
You are outrageous!
I cannot keep up with your energy.

1253
01:21:20,725 --> 01:21:23,225
They must pick you up on CB radios in Alaska.

1254
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:25,825
You get the feeling
something is starting between us?

1255
01:21:25,925 --> 01:21:28,125
I graduated from high school 16 years ago...

1256
01:21:28,225 --> 01:21:30,525
...and that was the last time
I heard that line.

1257
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:34,325
Out of my way, please. I have to sell
my little Japanese cars in the morning.

1258
01:21:34,425 --> 01:21:36,826
That's why you got the Kabuki makeup on?

1259
01:21:38,825 --> 01:21:40,626
And you let me stand there.

1260
01:21:48,725 --> 01:21:50,826
Give me a towel.

1261
01:21:59,226 --> 01:22:00,826
Don't you ever do that again.

1262
01:22:00,926 --> 01:22:03,326
Your lips may say no-no,
but your eyes say yes-yes.

1263
01:22:03,426 --> 01:22:04,726
Don't get cute with me!

1264
01:22:04,826 --> 01:22:07,427
You know your goddamn nose drives me crazy?

1265
01:22:07,726 --> 01:22:10,126
- What's wrong with my nose?
- It's pug. Very pug.

1266
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:13,426
It shoots down straight,
but then it turns pug at the last second.

1267
01:22:13,526 --> 01:22:14,226
Don't.

1268
01:22:14,326 --> 01:22:17,526
- We have a hot infatuation here.
- I have no time for romance.

1269
01:22:17,626 --> 01:22:19,526
I have a daughter to save from rickets.

1270
01:22:19,626 --> 01:22:23,126
You drove me crazy the first time
I saw you through the crack in that door.

1271
01:22:23,226 --> 01:22:26,626
I said to myself, "This is the best
half a face I ever laid eyes on."

1272
01:22:26,726 --> 01:22:29,026
Don't make me laugh. I am not on your side.

1273
01:22:29,126 --> 01:22:31,826
The smell of your hair drives me nuts,
I'm telling you!

1274
01:22:31,926 --> 01:22:33,926
I could be sleeping, you walk by my door...

1275
01:22:34,026 --> 01:22:37,626
...my nostrils wake me up and say,
"Who's that comin' down the street?"

1276
01:22:37,726 --> 01:22:39,026
You're embarrassing me.

1277
01:22:39,126 --> 01:22:42,027
I'm 33. I'm not supposed
to get embarrassed anymore.

1278
01:22:42,526 --> 01:22:46,127
If you were a Broadway musical,
people would be humming your face.

1279
01:22:46,826 --> 01:22:50,426
Please, don't do this.
Don't make me feel happy.

1280
01:22:50,526 --> 01:22:54,027
I hate that "Goddamn, it's wonderful
to be alive" feeling.

1281
01:22:54,226 --> 01:22:58,227
Do not come into my life.
I just got through putting up fences.

1282
01:22:58,526 --> 01:23:01,528
Can I walk you to your door?
It's a rough neighborhood.

1283
01:23:02,327 --> 01:23:05,127
Yes, call me Elliot.
I've already bitten your neck.

1284
01:23:05,227 --> 01:23:08,027
Elliot! I am praying to God
this is gone in the morning!

1285
01:23:08,127 --> 01:23:09,127
The hell you are!

1286
01:23:09,227 --> 01:23:12,228
Meet me in the kitchen tomorrow night.
Dress casual.

1287
01:23:21,427 --> 01:23:24,727
- Where are you running?
- I want to see Lucy before she goes to bed.

1288
01:23:24,827 --> 01:23:26,627
Wait, I have a message for you.

1289
01:23:26,727 --> 01:23:30,828
The Maserati people are throwing
a small party upstairs at 21...

1290
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:35,027
...and that guy, Giorgio, you know
the one that smells better than us?

1291
01:23:35,127 --> 01:23:39,027
He specifically asked for you.
"The girl with the laughing teeth."

1292
01:23:39,127 --> 01:23:41,027
I can't. I've got to go home.

1293
01:23:41,127 --> 01:23:44,028
I don't understand! That guy is gorgeous!

1294
01:23:44,527 --> 01:23:46,127
He told me to tell you that.

1295
01:23:46,227 --> 01:23:48,628
If it was any other time...

1296
01:24:35,128 --> 01:24:36,129
Elliot?

1297
01:24:42,228 --> 01:24:43,529
Are you up here?

1298
01:24:47,028 --> 01:24:48,329
Say something.

1299
01:24:50,528 --> 01:24:52,129
I don't like this.

1300
01:25:02,728 --> 01:25:04,629
I said it was formal, kid!

1301
01:25:16,929 --> 01:25:19,630
Party's got to be over by 9:00 a.m.

1302
01:25:20,929 --> 01:25:23,730
Otherwise, it's another $5 for the suit.

1303
01:25:41,129 --> 01:25:42,530
Don't panic!

1304
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:46,730
Even Ginger was nervous
the first time she danced with me.

1305
01:25:56,629 --> 01:25:58,330
"How about you?

1306
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:02,530
"I like a Gershwin tune

1307
01:26:03,829 --> 01:26:05,330
"How about you?

1308
01:26:07,029 --> 01:26:12,130
"I like the fireplace when the lights are low

1309
01:26:13,730 --> 01:26:17,331
"I like potato chips,
moonlight and motor trips

1310
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:19,931
"How about you?"

1311
01:26:23,030 --> 01:26:24,731
What are you crying about?

1312
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:27,031
So kill me...

1313
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:29,531
...l'm a sucker for romance.

1314
01:26:31,530 --> 01:26:34,131
Elliot Garfield is a many-faceted individual.

1315
01:26:37,530 --> 01:26:38,631
I got a job.

1316
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:42,231
A real acting job.

1317
01:26:42,730 --> 01:26:45,130
You did? Where?

1318
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:48,131
The Inventory.
It's an improvisational group on Charles St.

1319
01:26:48,930 --> 01:26:50,430
They saw Richard III.

1320
01:26:50,530 --> 01:26:53,331
They said if I could do that,
I could do anything!

1321
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:58,730
- Don't let it rain.
- Don't worry about it.

1322
01:26:58,830 --> 01:27:00,931
The suit's too big for me anyway.

1323
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:06,430
I auditioned for them today.
It's improvisation, you understand.

1324
01:27:06,530 --> 01:27:08,330
Now, very difficult...

1325
01:27:08,430 --> 01:27:11,330
...but I auditioned with
this very talented girl, Linda...

1326
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:12,931
Is she pretty?

1327
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:16,531
No, very unpretty. Very ugly. Unpug-nosed.

1328
01:27:18,131 --> 01:27:20,731
I played Abraham Lincoln.
Mary Todd Lincoln's out of town.

1329
01:27:20,831 --> 01:27:25,032
General Grant takes me to a cathouse.
We're all tryin' to act very dignified...

1330
01:27:31,531 --> 01:27:33,531
Don't stop, I never danced in the rain!

1331
01:27:33,631 --> 01:27:36,532
The hell with dancing,
my pizza's getting drenched!

1332
01:27:37,331 --> 01:27:38,432
Wait.

1333
01:27:40,231 --> 01:27:41,232
I got it.

1334
01:27:42,031 --> 01:27:43,131
I'll get it.

1335
01:27:43,231 --> 01:27:46,231
What happened after you found out
about this other girl and Tony?

1336
01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:48,732
- Bobby. Tony comes after Bobby.
- Sorry.

1337
01:27:53,131 --> 01:27:55,631
It happens all the time on the road.

1338
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:58,732
He's gone for six months with the play,
he gets lonely.

1339
01:27:59,331 --> 01:28:02,931
The only time you have a good marriage
is when your husband is in a flop.

1340
01:28:03,031 --> 01:28:04,932
He's broke, but he's home.

1341
01:28:07,431 --> 01:28:09,232
How'd you meet Tony?

1342
01:28:10,831 --> 01:28:12,732
I'm ashamed to tell you.

1343
01:28:13,431 --> 01:28:14,332
Why?

1344
01:28:17,931 --> 01:28:20,931
I saw him in The Iceman Cometh
at Circle in the Square.

1345
01:28:21,031 --> 01:28:24,033
He wasn't very good, but he was gorgeous.

1346
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,933
I couldn't take my eyes off of him.

1347
01:28:28,832 --> 01:28:29,933
Don't ask.

1348
01:28:31,532 --> 01:28:33,832
I waited until he came out
of the stage door...

1349
01:28:33,932 --> 01:28:37,333
...and I introduced myself,
like a regular groupie.

1350
01:28:39,232 --> 01:28:41,333
A week later I moved in with him.

1351
01:28:42,432 --> 01:28:44,533
I used to do things like that.

1352
01:28:44,732 --> 01:28:45,633
Why?

1353
01:28:48,032 --> 01:28:51,033
When you dance in the chorus of a musical...

1354
01:28:51,232 --> 01:28:53,732
...the boys' voices are usually higher
than the girls.

1355
01:28:53,832 --> 01:28:57,333
After ten years of that,
you get very hung up on macho men.

1356
01:28:57,932 --> 01:28:59,933
Thank God I am over that period.

1357
01:29:01,432 --> 01:29:03,533
I think I'll let that remark pass.

1358
01:29:06,632 --> 01:29:09,233
Are we gonna sleep with each other tonight?

1359
01:29:11,932 --> 01:29:15,933
Of all the "right up front" girls I know,
you are the "right up frontest."

1360
01:29:20,532 --> 01:29:22,333
How do you feel about it?

1361
01:29:23,632 --> 01:29:24,833
Nervous.

1362
01:29:25,132 --> 01:29:26,934
A pushover, but nervous.

1363
01:29:52,133 --> 01:29:54,934
Good morning, everybody. No applause, please.

1364
01:30:09,533 --> 01:30:11,534
What's new this morning?

1365
01:30:17,633 --> 01:30:19,734
Nothing's new this morning.

1366
01:30:22,533 --> 01:30:26,034
Did you hear this kid Lindbergh
is gonna try to fly the Atlantic?

1367
01:30:28,733 --> 01:30:30,733
Who do you think'll play it in the movie?

1368
01:30:30,833 --> 01:30:32,734
She didn't sleep too well last night.

1369
01:30:32,834 --> 01:30:34,235
I guess no one did.

1370
01:30:35,734 --> 01:30:37,135
See you tonight.

1371
01:30:42,434 --> 01:30:45,934
We've been found out, have we?
I thought the kid was rootin' for us.

1372
01:30:46,034 --> 01:30:49,235
Don't call her "kid."
She doesn't like to be called "kid."

1373
01:30:51,434 --> 01:30:52,335
Sorry.

1374
01:30:53,634 --> 01:30:55,934
In Chicago it's an expression
of endearment...

1375
01:30:56,034 --> 01:30:59,034
...like "Hiya, kid." "How ya doin', kid?"
"What's wrong, kid?"

1376
01:30:59,134 --> 01:31:00,335
Nothing.

1377
01:31:00,734 --> 01:31:01,735
Really?

1378
01:31:02,934 --> 01:31:04,435
Glad to hear it.

1379
01:31:05,934 --> 01:31:07,435
Any buttered toast?

1380
01:31:07,734 --> 01:31:09,435
She's scared, that's all.

1381
01:31:09,734 --> 01:31:10,635
Lucy?

1382
01:31:11,134 --> 01:31:13,634
She's afraid what happened before
will happen again.

1383
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:17,834
What is it with you two, are you partners?
I thought it was just you and me last night.

1384
01:31:17,934 --> 01:31:20,335
What happens in my life affects hers.

1385
01:31:21,934 --> 01:31:23,635
And I'm scared too.

1386
01:31:23,834 --> 01:31:27,835
Would you be terribly hurt
if we just forgot all about last night?

1387
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:32,734
It's a little late.
I've already made an entry in my diary.

1388
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:33,634
Look at me.

1389
01:31:33,734 --> 01:31:37,636
I am standing here with sweaty palms
and I have my hands in cold water.

1390
01:31:39,335 --> 01:31:42,035
I don't know what you're thinking
this morning.

1391
01:31:42,135 --> 01:31:44,535
Instead of asking
so goddamn many questions...

1392
01:31:44,635 --> 01:31:47,535
...you could at least say to me,
"Last night was wonderful."

1393
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:49,235
Last night was wonderful.

1394
01:31:49,335 --> 01:31:51,536
Oh, my God. I must be crazy.

1395
01:31:52,735 --> 01:31:56,636
I keep doing the same damn thing
to myself, over and over again.

1396
01:31:56,835 --> 01:31:58,736
When am I ever going to learn?

1397
01:31:59,535 --> 01:32:01,735
I am not up to falling in love again.

1398
01:32:01,835 --> 01:32:03,336
It is too much work.

1399
01:32:03,535 --> 01:32:06,035
I think we would all be
a whole lot better off...

1400
01:32:06,135 --> 01:32:08,635
...if you just packed up
your things and left.

1401
01:32:08,735 --> 01:32:10,136
Nothing personal.

1402
01:32:16,735 --> 01:32:19,836
I think I have a clue now
as to why all those other guys left!

1403
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,736
Crackers! Animal crackers, lady!

1404
01:32:22,935 --> 01:32:25,836
You got a severe case
of emotional retardation!

1405
01:32:26,835 --> 01:32:29,436
I'm not leaving, Paula! I'm escaping!

1406
01:32:31,835 --> 01:32:34,035
I will personally forward your mail!

1407
01:32:34,135 --> 01:32:37,836
Keep it! I'm not giving you
a forwarding address!

1408
01:32:38,535 --> 01:32:40,236
Lot of weirdos in this neighborhood.

1409
01:32:40,435 --> 01:32:44,436
But just in passing, I'd just like to say
that last night was terrific, okay?

1410
01:32:44,536 --> 01:32:48,136
It was the Super Bowl of romance.
I give it a fat nine on a scale of ten.

1411
01:32:48,236 --> 01:32:52,236
You lose one point for burping your wine,
but all in all it was a respectable score.

1412
01:32:52,336 --> 01:32:54,336
Don't you get glib about last night!

1413
01:32:54,436 --> 01:32:56,637
It was very important to me!

1414
01:32:56,836 --> 01:32:59,636
You want to lower your neurosis
for a minute, I'm not done.

1415
01:32:59,736 --> 01:33:02,436
- You want to know what your problem is?
- What?

1416
01:33:02,536 --> 01:33:04,036
You love to love somebody...

1417
01:33:04,136 --> 01:33:07,636
...but the minute that they take
the initiative, like I did last night...

1418
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:11,037
...that scares the pants off of you!
Nothing off-color intended.

1419
01:33:12,336 --> 01:33:14,636
You didn't wait at any stage door for me.

1420
01:33:14,736 --> 01:33:18,737
I approached first. I touched first.
And you can't handle that, can you?

1421
01:33:19,636 --> 01:33:20,937
He is laughable.

1422
01:33:22,036 --> 01:33:26,037
And silly! You are the silliest man
I ever met.

1423
01:33:26,236 --> 01:33:28,837
And you know that I'm right!

1424
01:33:29,536 --> 01:33:32,736
If you don't let go of me,
I'll punch your other eye out!

1425
01:33:32,836 --> 01:33:36,036
Paula, you know yourself too well
to ignore what I'm saying.

1426
01:33:36,136 --> 01:33:38,736
That is exactly why I am trying to ignore it.

1427
01:33:38,836 --> 01:33:42,036
You know what we got here?
Taming of the Shrew is what we got here.

1428
01:33:42,136 --> 01:33:45,238
Despite the fact, Kate,
you're one large pain in the arse...

1429
01:33:45,737 --> 01:33:48,737
...last night was the best thing
I ever had, girl-wise.

1430
01:33:48,837 --> 01:33:51,737
If you weren't behaving
like such a horse's rectum...

1431
01:33:51,837 --> 01:33:54,637
...we could've been touching
and fondling all day...

1432
01:33:54,737 --> 01:33:57,238
...until about 5:00
when I got to go to rehearsal!

1433
01:33:59,037 --> 01:34:01,438
Personally, madam, I think you blew it.

1434
01:34:29,937 --> 01:34:32,238
Lady Anne! The Black Prince is dead!

1435
01:34:33,237 --> 01:34:34,638
England is yours!

1436
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:37,837
You don't want England?

1437
01:34:37,937 --> 01:34:40,237
Would you take Spain?
Spain I can get you cheap.

1438
01:34:40,337 --> 01:34:42,037
What are you doing in that thing?

1439
01:34:42,137 --> 01:34:45,238
Come on, get in quick.
The horse has got a meter on him.

1440
01:34:45,537 --> 01:34:46,738
Where to?

1441
01:34:46,937 --> 01:34:50,139
"We're going home, to Tara!" Get in!

1442
01:34:52,538 --> 01:34:54,039
Cynthia Fine, right?

1443
01:34:55,138 --> 01:34:56,738
I think you got charisma too.

1444
01:34:56,838 --> 01:34:59,739
Lucy! Did you tell him? I never said that!

1445
01:35:00,138 --> 01:35:02,439
I'm gonna get you, Lucy, you big fink!

1446
01:35:09,738 --> 01:35:13,638
You want to go to my opening tonight?
I owe you a good time after the last one.

1447
01:35:13,738 --> 01:35:15,239
I have homework.

1448
01:35:15,838 --> 01:35:17,838
Why are you sore? Me and your mom?

1449
01:35:17,938 --> 01:35:19,739
It's none of my business.

1450
01:35:22,338 --> 01:35:25,238
Since you and I are exchanging rooms
tonight, I think it is.

1451
01:35:25,338 --> 01:35:27,638
I'm a little old-fashioned.
I want your approval.

1452
01:35:27,738 --> 01:35:31,039
Me? I'm only 10 years old.
I'm not allowed to vote yet.

1453
01:35:32,438 --> 01:35:36,438
I like your style, kid. I'm sorry.
I hear you don't like to be called "kid."

1454
01:35:36,538 --> 01:35:38,139
I'm a kid, it fits.

1455
01:35:39,438 --> 01:35:40,938
Do you like me?

1456
01:35:41,038 --> 01:35:43,438
You're wasting money.
I'm not enjoying this ride.

1457
01:35:43,538 --> 01:35:45,939
Answer my question. Do you like me?

1458
01:35:46,538 --> 01:35:48,939
Ask Cynthia Fine. She's crazy about you.

1459
01:35:49,538 --> 01:35:52,138
I'm gonna keep asking you
until you answer me.

1460
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:54,739
- Do you like me?
- Can I get out? I'm getting nauseous.

1461
01:35:54,839 --> 01:35:57,539
Answer my question, goddamn it. Yes or no?

1462
01:35:57,639 --> 01:35:59,839
It makes no difference to me either way.

1463
01:35:59,939 --> 01:36:01,739
I'm movin' in with your old lady.

1464
01:36:01,839 --> 01:36:03,939
I just want to hear it from your own lips.

1465
01:36:04,039 --> 01:36:05,540
- Now, yes or no?
- No!

1466
01:36:07,539 --> 01:36:08,540
Yes.

1467
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:14,040
- Was that a yes?
- Yes.

1468
01:36:15,139 --> 01:36:17,840
- A really, really, really lot?
- Yes, all right?

1469
01:36:21,639 --> 01:36:25,140
And as much as you like me, it's not.001...

1470
01:36:25,339 --> 01:36:28,340
...as much as I'm crazy about you.
I swear to God, Lucy.

1471
01:36:28,839 --> 01:36:31,839
You can cry all over yourself,
I'm gonna tell it to you anyway.

1472
01:36:31,939 --> 01:36:34,939
I am certifiably nuts about you
and your ditzy mom!

1473
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:37,939
- So blow that into your handkerchief.
- I don't have one.

1474
01:36:38,039 --> 01:36:39,840
So cry on the horsey!

1475
01:36:47,339 --> 01:36:50,840
You know what I want more
than anything else in the whole world?

1476
01:36:52,039 --> 01:36:54,740
My very own living room set.

1477
01:36:55,539 --> 01:36:59,040
You know, it's a nice feeling
to hear real people applauding.

1478
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,240
I took the names and addresses
of everyone in the audience.

1479
01:37:03,340 --> 01:37:06,040
I think we should have them
over for dinner real soon.

1480
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:09,441
We definitely have to repaint the bedroom,
don't you think?

1481
01:37:10,440 --> 01:37:11,441
What?

1482
01:37:11,940 --> 01:37:13,541
I'm redecorating.

1483
01:37:14,140 --> 01:37:16,541
What color should we paint the bedroom?

1484
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,141
Successful.

1485
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:25,741
That's good.

1486
01:38:35,641 --> 01:38:37,142
Something is wrong.

1487
01:38:38,741 --> 01:38:40,442
It didn't come out right.

1488
01:38:42,441 --> 01:38:44,242
What's wrong with it?

1489
01:38:44,441 --> 01:38:47,342
In the first place, it's not on Park Avenue.

1490
01:38:47,541 --> 01:38:50,941
How many more weeks do you have
to play before I could get an armchair?

1491
01:38:51,041 --> 01:38:53,742
If you'll take one without arms,
about a year.

1492
01:38:55,141 --> 01:38:57,442
Momma Bear has done the cave real nice.

1493
01:39:00,541 --> 01:39:02,042
Where are you going?

1494
01:39:05,541 --> 01:39:07,041
I'm crazy about you.

1495
01:39:07,141 --> 01:39:10,843
I'm very fond of you myself.
You have some very nice qualities.

1496
01:39:12,642 --> 01:39:14,242
Leave Tuesday morning open.

1497
01:39:14,342 --> 01:39:15,842
Why, what's Tuesday?

1498
01:39:15,942 --> 01:39:17,843
How do blood tests strike you?

1499
01:39:40,042 --> 01:39:42,142
- It was a great audience!
- Four-star show!

1500
01:39:42,242 --> 01:39:44,142
I want to take the show home and bottle it!

1501
01:39:44,242 --> 01:39:46,743
I want to go home and sleep till Wednesday!

1502
01:39:47,942 --> 01:39:50,742
- There is no air in here.
- I can't do anything about it.

1503
01:39:50,842 --> 01:39:55,142
Give the actors some air!
We are human beings, not cattle!

1504
01:39:55,242 --> 01:39:57,143
Let's hear it for the actors!

1505
01:40:07,942 --> 01:40:08,642
Hello?

1506
01:40:08,742 --> 01:40:10,043
Who is that?

1507
01:40:11,242 --> 01:40:13,044
Hello. Oliver Frey.

1508
01:40:14,043 --> 01:40:15,543
Oliver Frey, the director?

1509
01:40:15,643 --> 01:40:17,044
I believe so.

1510
01:40:17,943 --> 01:40:19,644
It's nice to meet you.

1511
01:40:19,943 --> 01:40:21,944
Oliver Frey, what do you know?

1512
01:40:22,143 --> 01:40:23,844
Would you like to come in?

1513
01:40:26,843 --> 01:40:28,043
Pleased to meet you.

1514
01:40:28,143 --> 01:40:30,544
- It's very nice to...
- We won't keep you.

1515
01:40:31,143 --> 01:40:33,644
There was just one question I wanted to ask.

1516
01:40:34,043 --> 01:40:36,044
Would you be interested in a movie?

1517
01:40:36,943 --> 01:40:38,744
You mean making one?

1518
01:40:39,543 --> 01:40:43,044
We could go to one,
but I think working is much more fun.

1519
01:40:44,343 --> 01:40:45,444
With you?

1520
01:40:46,243 --> 01:40:48,144
Yes, I'm interested.

1521
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:49,343
I am too.

1522
01:40:49,443 --> 01:40:50,844
Are you kidding?

1523
01:40:51,443 --> 01:40:52,844
Certainly, sure.

1524
01:40:54,743 --> 01:40:58,644
What are you doing out here?
You didn't lock yourself out again, did you?

1525
01:40:59,843 --> 01:41:01,444
Lucy, what is it?

1526
01:41:02,043 --> 01:41:04,544
At least we didn't get a letter this time.

1527
01:41:23,644 --> 01:41:26,245
Sending that stuff out to the laundry,
I hope.

1528
01:41:26,444 --> 01:41:28,045
I got a picture, Paula!

1529
01:41:29,044 --> 01:41:31,545
- What?
- I got a picture, I got a movie.

1530
01:41:32,844 --> 01:41:33,845
Shit.

1531
01:41:34,044 --> 01:41:36,944
Terrific picture. Oliver Frey is directing.

1532
01:41:37,044 --> 01:41:40,044
I've got to be on location
in Seattle tomorrow morning.

1533
01:41:40,144 --> 01:41:41,644
Seattle, Washington.

1534
01:41:41,744 --> 01:41:44,345
I know where it is. Far away.

1535
01:41:44,644 --> 01:41:46,445
Who cares? I'm not walkin'.

1536
01:41:47,944 --> 01:41:51,245
They left a first-class air ticket
at the airport for me.

1537
01:41:52,344 --> 01:41:54,345
Four weeks' work, $2,000 a week.

1538
01:41:55,044 --> 01:41:56,945
It's freaking Oliver Frey!

1539
01:41:58,844 --> 01:42:01,345
I forgot to ask what the part was.

1540
01:42:01,844 --> 01:42:03,145
That's wonderful.

1541
01:42:03,744 --> 01:42:05,444
I'm not making any comparisons...

1542
01:42:05,544 --> 01:42:08,244
...but whoever heard of Al Pacino
before The Godfather?

1543
01:42:08,344 --> 01:42:10,245
I couldn't be happier for you.

1544
01:42:11,344 --> 01:42:12,745
Jesus, I am so scared.

1545
01:42:13,844 --> 01:42:16,744
I spend 20 years building up my ego
and when I really need it...

1546
01:42:16,844 --> 01:42:18,444
...it locks itself in the john.

1547
01:42:18,544 --> 01:42:20,444
It'll come back to you, trust me.

1548
01:42:20,544 --> 01:42:21,745
What's wrong?

1549
01:42:22,545 --> 01:42:24,445
Come on, it's only four weeks.

1550
01:42:24,545 --> 01:42:26,545
That's one week less than five.

1551
01:42:26,645 --> 01:42:27,646
I know.

1552
01:42:28,945 --> 01:42:30,446
You don't know.

1553
01:42:30,945 --> 01:42:33,845
You think you're going
to get dumped on again, don't you?

1554
01:42:33,945 --> 01:42:36,145
If you say you'll be back,
why not believe you?

1555
01:42:36,245 --> 01:42:40,046
If I were you and I saw an actor packing,
I wouldn't believe him either.

1556
01:42:49,745 --> 01:42:51,146
You need any help?

1557
01:42:57,345 --> 01:42:59,046
I see you took everything.

1558
01:42:59,645 --> 01:43:03,146
They said it was going to be
really freezing up there...

1559
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:05,846
...take all my warm clothing.

1560
01:43:08,245 --> 01:43:10,746
You know that I would take you if I could.

1561
01:43:11,645 --> 01:43:15,345
But it's rough country up there.
It's up in the mountains. There are wolves.

1562
01:43:15,445 --> 01:43:18,846
I don't mean in the movie either.
I mean real, hungry wolves.

1563
01:43:19,745 --> 01:43:21,845
I always got along fine with wolves.

1564
01:43:21,945 --> 01:43:24,046
Honey, I thought you'd be excited.

1565
01:43:25,045 --> 01:43:28,447
Jumpin' up and down.
It's what I've worked for my whole life.

1566
01:43:29,846 --> 01:43:33,746
Isn't that what a mature relationship
is about? I root for you, you root for me.

1567
01:43:33,846 --> 01:43:36,247
It's my third time up as cheerleader!

1568
01:43:36,446 --> 01:43:38,247
Okay, I get the point.

1569
01:43:39,546 --> 01:43:41,347
Forget it, I'm not going!

1570
01:43:41,846 --> 01:43:43,046
It's not worth it!

1571
01:43:43,146 --> 01:43:46,046
Not if it means I got to put you through
four weeks of hell...

1572
01:43:46,146 --> 01:43:49,246
...wondering whether I'm coming back.
Forget it! I won't go!

1573
01:43:49,346 --> 01:43:51,147
It's just a job, right?

1574
01:43:51,746 --> 01:43:52,846
Hell with it!

1575
01:43:52,946 --> 01:43:56,647
If I got this job I can get another job.
I'm lettin' it go! Okay?

1576
01:43:57,346 --> 01:44:00,147
The hell I'm not gonna go! That's crazy!

1577
01:44:00,346 --> 01:44:03,246
That's a dumb, stupid thing to do
because you don't trust me.

1578
01:44:03,346 --> 01:44:05,346
You have to trust me. Do you trust me?

1579
01:44:05,446 --> 01:44:07,046
I'll plan my days around it.

1580
01:44:07,146 --> 01:44:10,546
Goddamn them to hell! I hate those guys
that walked out of here.

1581
01:44:10,646 --> 01:44:11,546
I hate them.

1582
01:44:11,646 --> 01:44:15,047
I'm the only one that's comin' back
and I'm gettin' all the blame.

1583
01:44:20,546 --> 01:44:22,747
No, you go, Elliot. I want you to go.

1584
01:44:22,946 --> 01:44:25,946
If you come back, fine.
I'll be here putting up my wallpaper.

1585
01:44:26,046 --> 01:44:27,947
And if not, that's okay, too.

1586
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:30,647
I'll miss you...

1587
01:44:31,446 --> 01:44:33,448
...but I'll survive.

1588
01:44:33,847 --> 01:44:36,047
'Cause I've grown up
these last couple of months.

1589
01:44:36,147 --> 01:44:38,448
Look at me. I'm all grown up.

1590
01:44:39,247 --> 01:44:41,747
It was better than spending a summer at camp.

1591
01:44:41,847 --> 01:44:44,147
I never felt better or stronger in my life.

1592
01:44:44,247 --> 01:44:49,148
Someone is walking out that door
and I'm not crumbling into a million pieces.

1593
01:44:50,447 --> 01:44:53,348
Jesus, it really does feel good.

1594
01:44:55,147 --> 01:44:56,548
Goodbye, Elliot.

1595
01:45:05,047 --> 01:45:06,547
You make a nice movie.

1596
01:45:06,647 --> 01:45:08,347
Have a wonderful career.

1597
01:45:08,447 --> 01:45:10,347
If you're ever up for an Academy Award...

1598
01:45:10,447 --> 01:45:13,148
...I promise you I'll keep
my fingers crossed for you.

1599
01:45:15,047 --> 01:45:19,348
What is it about you that makes a man
with 147 I.Q., feel like a dribbling idiot?

1600
01:45:20,447 --> 01:45:23,448
I don't know, but whatever it is,
I thank God for it.

1601
01:45:24,647 --> 01:45:26,048
You're welcome, God.

1602
01:45:26,947 --> 01:45:29,048
Interesting lesson I'm learning.

1603
01:45:29,647 --> 01:45:31,448
Really interesting.

1604
01:45:31,747 --> 01:45:34,547
It could be that falling in love
and becoming successful...

1605
01:45:34,647 --> 01:45:38,049
...is probably the worst thing
that could ever happen to a guy.

1606
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:41,949
If my plane crashes in the storm,
I'm coming back here, Paula.

1607
01:45:42,248 --> 01:45:43,349
I mean it!

1608
01:45:45,548 --> 01:45:49,449
I'll be dragging chains around
this apartment when you're 90 years old.

1609
01:45:57,048 --> 01:45:58,249
So long, kid.

1610
01:45:59,748 --> 01:46:01,049
I'll see you, kid.

1611
01:46:16,148 --> 01:46:17,549
I can't sleep.

1612
01:46:19,648 --> 01:46:22,349
Give it five minutes, you just got into bed.

1613
01:46:23,148 --> 01:46:25,149
I can predict the future.

1614
01:46:27,148 --> 01:46:28,849
How about predicting mine?

1615
01:46:31,848 --> 01:46:35,349
I can hear the phone ringing in your life.

1616
01:46:38,248 --> 01:46:39,349
Hello?

1617
01:46:39,548 --> 01:46:40,748
Get dressed.

1618
01:46:40,848 --> 01:46:41,849
What?

1619
01:46:41,949 --> 01:46:44,250
Get dressed, you're coming with me.

1620
01:46:44,349 --> 01:46:45,849
What? Where are you?

1621
01:46:45,949 --> 01:46:48,650
On the corner, in my old leaky phone booth.

1622
01:46:52,849 --> 01:46:55,850
The plane had engine trouble.
We're delayed two hours.

1623
01:46:56,449 --> 01:46:58,850
I cashed in first-class for two economys.

1624
01:47:00,749 --> 01:47:03,650
- What do I do about Lucy?
- Don't worry about Lucy.

1625
01:47:03,949 --> 01:47:06,949
Call Donna.
She can stay with her until we get back.

1626
01:47:07,049 --> 01:47:10,350
Come on, Paula, the cab is ticking away
your new bedroom set.

1627
01:47:11,149 --> 01:47:13,349
I thought I couldn't come with you.

1628
01:47:13,449 --> 01:47:17,049
I'll tell them you're my analyst.
Actors are known to be very high strung.

1629
01:47:17,149 --> 01:47:19,050
And you really want me to come?

1630
01:47:19,849 --> 01:47:22,450
You sure love a love scene, don't you?

1631
01:47:22,749 --> 01:47:24,550
Yeah, I want you to come.

1632
01:47:25,549 --> 01:47:28,049
Then it's okay, I don't have to.

1633
01:47:28,149 --> 01:47:30,050
Just as long as you asked.

1634
01:47:30,649 --> 01:47:34,049
Paula, don't play games with me.
My socks are underwater.

1635
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:37,149
No, you have enough work to do
without worrying about me...

1636
01:47:37,249 --> 01:47:39,449
...and besides, I have a lot of work to do.

1637
01:47:39,549 --> 01:47:43,850
I am going to be spending your money
on our apartment.

1638
01:47:44,449 --> 01:47:46,351
And I am nuts about you!

1639
01:47:47,250 --> 01:47:49,751
I hope I'm callin' the right number.

1640
01:47:52,150 --> 01:47:53,651
Will you do me a favor?

1641
01:47:53,850 --> 01:47:55,351
Anything, my angel.

1642
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,451
Will you have my guitar re-strung?

1643
01:47:59,750 --> 01:48:02,350
- He left his guitar!
- He is coming back!

1644
01:48:02,450 --> 01:48:04,551
I never doubted it for a minute.

1645
01:48:05,150 --> 01:48:06,651
Wait. Oh, my God.

1646
01:48:09,050 --> 01:48:09,951
Wait!

1647
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:13,651
I have it, sweetheart!

1648
01:48:13,850 --> 01:48:15,550
Have a safe trip.

1649
01:48:15,650 --> 01:48:17,251
I love you!

1650
01:48:17,850 --> 01:48:20,651
Never mind that. You're rusting my guitar!
