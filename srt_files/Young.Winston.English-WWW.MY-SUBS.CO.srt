169
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,868

170
00:20:02,494 --> 00:20:04,705

171

172
00:20:11,503 --> 00:20:14,214
<i>Nevertheless, it was my father</i>

173
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:19,594
<i>who was the greatest and most</i>
<i>powerful influence on my early life.</i>

174
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:23,140
<i>He was the second son</i>
<i>of the Duke of Marlborough</i>

175
00:20:23,306 --> 00:20:27,144
<i>and a Tory member</i>
<i>of the House of Commons.</i>

<i>even less.</i>

179
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:46,455
<i>He numbered among his friends</i>

<i>some of the most important</i>

181

<i>and indeed in all England.</i>

182
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:57,591
<i>Men like Lord Salisbury,</i>
<i>the leader of the Tory Party,</i>

183
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:00,260

186

<i>And even I knew that one day,</i>

187
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,396
<i>when the people</i>
<i>came to their senses</i>

188
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,316

<i>back into power,</i>

189
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:18,570

Are none of your Jewish friends

193
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:30,415
No, I didn't think
it would be fair to them.

194
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:32,626

Thank you, sir.

199
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,535
Now, we enter
this in your name.

200
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,161
So.

201
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:13,834
And then you can purchase anything you
like from the school shop.

202
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,003
Up to the limit of
your credit, of course.

203

I'm afraid Winston doesn't quite
understand about money yet.

We shall teach him.

This young man will be very happy here,
Lady Randolph, I assure you.

206

I am certain he will.

207

But you'll take tea,
Lady Randolph?

208
00:22:34,354 --> 00:22:36,356
Oh, I'm afraid I can't.
I shall miss my train.

I shall want you
to remember always.

00:23:48,553 --> 00:23:52,974
Your school days are the most

219

- Yes, sir.

231
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:35,183

Very good. Come along.

242
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,155
Excuse me, sir,
but what does it mean?

243
00:25:31,406 --> 00:25:34,784
It means what it says.
<i>Mensa</i>: a table.

244
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:36,870
<i>Mensa</i> is a noun
of the first declension.

245
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,329
There are five declensions.

246
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,666
You have learnt the singular
of the first declension.

247
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,669
Yes, sir.
But what does it mean?

248
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:50,091
I have told you.
<i>Mensa</i> in Latin means "a table".

249
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,968
But it means
"o table" too, sir.

250
00:25:52,177 --> 00:25:53,553
And what does "o table" mean?

251
00:25:54,804 --> 00:25:58,433
<i>"Mensa</i>: o table"
is the vocative case.

252
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,351
O table.

253
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:05,065
You would use that in addressing a table,
in invoking a table.

254
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,279
You would use it
in speaking to a table.

255
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:14,783
But I never do, sir.

00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,296
He never lolls.
He works very hard.

Oh, and what time, may I ask,
does His Lordship arise in the morning?

Well, I'm sorry, ma'am

340
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:43,778
I could never vote for a man
who lies abed until eleven o'clock!

341
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:47,865
That is the end of it, ma'am.
Good day.

342
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,251
Good day.

till eleven, does he?

345
00:32:10,138 --> 00:32:12,640
Well, ma'am, looking at you now,

346
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:16,436
it's a wonder to me
he bothers to get out at all.

347
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:19,063

Marlene. Is Lord Randolph in?

350
00:32:31,742 --> 00:32:34,078
- No, my lady.
- Oh. Where's Everest?

351
00:32:34,287 --> 00:32:35,997
I'm here, Lady Randolph.

352
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:39,876
If I might speak to you?
Now, please.

353
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,441

354

<i>Lord Randolph. Many people</i>

<i>you tendered your resignation</i>

362

<i>to the Prime Minister,</i>
<i>Lord Salisbury.</i>

363

365

I refuse to discuss that any further.

366
00:33:53,407 --> 00:33:55,159
To put an end to it, let me say

367
00:33:55,368 --> 00:34:00,748
that I have never run away from a fight
when I believed it necessary.

368
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:03,584

loyal to the Tory Party.

some of my friends in my own party
have a great lesson to learn.

371
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,094
The Tory Party
will never remain in power

372
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:17,306
until it gains the confidence of
the minorities and the working classes.

373
00:34:17,473 --> 00:34:21,686
Because the working classes are quite
determined to govern themselves.

374
00:34:21,852 --> 00:34:25,231

<i>Your theory of Tory democracy.</i>

<i>few who take it seriously.</i>

Really?

377
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:32,071
<i>Yes. After all, as an aristocrat</i>

378
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:36,033
<i>it's difficult to accept you</i>
<i>as an advocate of democracy.</i>

379
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,244
<i>Many people think</i>
<i>you use it as a device</i>

380
00:34:38,411 --> 00:34:42,707
<i>to make yourself Prime Minister</i>
<i>in Lord Salisbury's place.</i>

381
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:45,459
Do you?

00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:49,213
<i>- Not at all.</i>
- Good.

<i>Recently, you've expressed strong views</i>
<i>on the state of the Irish question.</i>

384

Ah, well... the Irish question...

385

<i>Your splendid home</i>

00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:37,470
<i>How do you find it?</i>
<i>Do you prefer it to gas?</i>

397
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,640
Well, it's all rather
up-to-date, I suppose.

398
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:43,684
That thing in the cellar,
I think you call it the dynamo,

399
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:45,895
is rather noisy.

400
00:35:46,062 --> 00:35:49,523
The lights will keep going out
always at the wrong times.

401
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:53,110
No, I don't think that electric light
will ever replace gas.

- At least, not in private houses.
<i>- No, no.</i>

<i>I believe, Lord Randolph,</i>
<i>you have a son.</i>

404
00:35:58,866 --> 00:36:01,744
What? Yes. Actually, two.

405
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,664
Two sons, Winston and Jack.

That is also correct.

Lord Randolph,

455
00:39:37,918 --> 00:39:42,715
you have taken me into your confidence
by showing me this letter.

00:39:43,215 --> 00:39:45,593
I ask you...

457
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,305
I beg you not to send it
to Lord Salisbury.

458
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,765
I already have. That's a copy.

459
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,851
Then I urge you to withdraw it.

00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:07,656
This time, he will stand firm.

00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,872
Forgive me if I seem
to be taking a liberty,

to leave the government at this time,

You must not do it.

has been wasted before

474
00:40:38,562 --> 00:40:41,190
and the nation has survived.

475
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:44,360
As I understand it, every one of
your colleagues in the Cabinet

476
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:47,404
is willing to accept this bill.

477
00:40:47,738 --> 00:40:49,865

necessary to resign?

Because, in addition to being
Leader of the House of Commons,

479
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:55,579
I'm also Chancellor of the Exchequer.

480

be grateful. After all,

of national defence?

you were going to <i>The Times.</i>

Oh, dear, yes.
Show him in, will you?

522
00:43:58,554 --> 00:44:01,140
- Good morning, Lady Randolph.
- Good morning, Mr Moore.

- Lord Randolph?
- Yes, it's quite true, Moore.

in a private capacity,

although he will seem to recover,

although he will seem from time to time
to be perfectly normal,

614
00:49:48,278 --> 00:49:52,365
in fact, he will
deteriorate consistently.

615
00:49:52,782 --> 00:49:55,327
He will suffer paralysis
in his limbs,

616
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:59,623
and his speech will become
impaired. As will his mind.

00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:28,224
Father.

673
00:54:33,354 --> 00:54:37,817
I'm awfully sorry, Father.
I'll be better. I promise you, truly.

674
00:54:38,193 --> 00:54:40,278
I'm sure you will be.

675
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:44,532
- We won't talk about it any more.
- Thank you, Father.

676
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,663
You know, Winston...

677
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:54,918
the world of politics can be
very difficult sometimes.

678
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:58,963
And I have my share
of problems these days.

679
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:01,925
The things I do are misjudged.

680
00:55:02,133 --> 00:55:06,387
Things I say are often distorted.

681
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:12,185
Perhaps that's why
I'm so often bad-tempered.

682
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:16,064
Oh, no, Father. You're a great man.
Everyone knows that.

683
00:55:16,231 --> 00:55:18,691
Everyone knows Lord Salisbury
treated you very badly.

684
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,820
And you'll show him.
All of them.

685
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,948
Thank you.

686
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:27,408
Thank you, my boy.

687
00:55:28,034 --> 00:55:31,037
Anyway, I think...

688
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:32,705
older people aren't always

689
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:36,584
particularly considerate
to younger people, to children.

690
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:39,504
They forget what it was like
when they were children.

691
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:41,589
And sometimes,
when they're bad-tempered,

692
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:44,801
they speak more harshly
than they think they are or mean to.

693
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:46,302
Yes, I know, Father.

694
00:55:47,929 --> 00:55:50,849
Well, I think there have been
times when I've done that.

695
00:55:51,933 --> 00:55:53,518
Perhaps this morning.

696
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:56,312
But I would never...

697
00:55:56,521 --> 00:55:58,773
wish you to feel

698
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:02,360
that I don't care
for you very much.

699
00:56:03,278 --> 00:56:05,405
Because I do.

700
00:56:06,781 --> 00:56:09,784
Thank you, Papa.
I mean, Father.

701
00:56:12,662 --> 00:56:14,163
I say, Winston,

702
00:56:14,330 --> 00:56:17,625
your collection has become
most impressive, hasn't it?

703
00:56:17,834 --> 00:56:20,128
You're rather short
of artillery, aren't you?

704
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:24,424
Yes, Father.
Only five field guns.

705
00:56:26,551 --> 00:56:28,011
Yes, well.

706
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,429
Now, that's not really...

707
00:56:29,596 --> 00:56:32,181
CHURCHILL:
<i>It was one of the three or four</i>

708
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:38,313
<i>long, intimate conversations with him,</i>
<i>which are all I can boast.</i>

709
00:56:38,897 --> 00:56:42,775
<i>He spoke in the most wonderful</i>
<i>and captivating manner,</i>

710
00:56:42,942 --> 00:56:45,820
<i>and, when he inspected my troops,</i>

711
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:49,073
<i>he displayed such a</i>
<i>knowledge of military affairs</i>

712
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,075
<i>that it would</i>
<i>have astounded me</i>

713
00:56:51,492 --> 00:56:55,163
<i>had I not already been aware</i>
<i>of his breadth of mind.</i>

714
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:57,165
Winston?

715
00:56:57,957 --> 00:57:02,170
When you grow up,
would you like to go into the army?

716
00:57:02,337 --> 00:57:04,088
Would you like me to, Father?

717
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:06,466
No, it's what you would like
that counts.

718
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:08,509
Well...

719
00:57:09,469 --> 00:57:11,137
I'm awfully good at history.

720
00:57:11,304 --> 00:57:15,350
Especially about wars and
battles and generals and...

721
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:17,393
Yes, Father,
I'd like to very much.

722
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,480
- Very much.
- Good.

723
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:23,232
We'll talk about that again later.

724
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,526
There's an army class
at Harrow, isn't there?

725
00:57:25,693 --> 00:57:28,154
I'll have a chat with Welldon,
see what he thinks.

726
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,448
Yes.

727
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:36,371
Goodbye, Winston.

728
00:57:36,537 --> 00:57:38,581
Goodbye, Father.

729
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,336
Womany.

730
00:57:43,503 --> 00:57:45,380
- Womany!
- What is it, for heaven's sake?

731
00:57:45,546 --> 00:57:47,507
Father talked to me!
He talked to me for the longest time,

732
00:57:47,715 --> 00:57:50,760
and he was so kind,
and I'm going into the army!

733
00:57:50,927 --> 00:57:52,971
The army?

734
00:57:55,098 --> 00:57:56,975
The army?

735
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:59,769
Jennie, he's our son, but we mustn't
blind ourselves, must we?

736
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:01,521
He's no scholar.

737
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:04,607
Can you imagine him
qualifying for the Bar

738
00:58:04,816 --> 00:58:07,527
or cutting any kind
of figure in politics?

739
00:58:07,735 --> 00:58:11,030
So unless you see
him in the Church...

740
00:58:12,198 --> 00:58:15,535
No, you see, the army's all that's left.
I think it's an inspiration.

741
00:58:15,702 --> 00:58:17,537
We have to get him into Sandhurst,

742
00:58:17,704 --> 00:58:21,582
and that, of course,
means passing the examination.

743
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,087
The army.

744
00:58:29,716 --> 00:58:33,261
Well, that's three or four
years off, anyway, isn't it?

745
00:58:35,513 --> 00:58:38,349
CHURCHILL:
<i>Unfortunately, it took not one,</i>

746
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:43,146
<i>but three examinations</i>
<i>to get me into Sandhurst.</i>

747

(HESITANT KNOCKING)

748
00:58:57,910 --> 00:58:59,245
Come in.

749
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,962
Did my letter come, Father?

750
00:59:08,337 --> 00:59:11,674
I've been accepted.
I passed.

751
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,387
You seem very pleased
with yourself, Winston.

752
00:59:16,554 --> 00:59:19,557
I'm afraid I don't share
your satisfaction.

753
00:59:19,766 --> 00:59:21,100
But I passed.

754
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,269
Yes, you passed.

755
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:24,729
(COUGHING)

756
00:59:24,896 --> 00:59:27,857
There are two ways of passing
an examination, Winston,

757
00:59:27,982 --> 00:59:30,526
one that does you credit
and one that does not.

758
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:32,403
As usual,
you have chosen the latter.

759
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,907
Seventh from the bottom
of the entire class.

760
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,659
But I did pass.

761
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:43,664
Yes. You passed...

762
00:59:44,665 --> 00:59:47,877
but you failed
to get into the infantry.

763
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:49,879
You merely
scraped into the cavalry,

764
00:59:50,046 --> 00:59:53,841
which everybody knows
is the mark of a third-rate pass.

765
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:56,886
Now, that will cost
me an extra...

766
00:59:57,053 --> 01:00:00,473
two hundred pounds a year
to get you a horse.

767
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,517
And this after all those
months of cramming,

768
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:07,438
and all the trouble I went to with the Duke
of Cambridge to get you into 60th Rifles,

769
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,525
one of the finest regiments
in the British army.

770
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:14,737
But I only failed the infantry
by 18 marks, Father.

771
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:18,157
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry?

772
01:00:18,324 --> 01:00:20,326
You are sorry?

773
01:00:20,493 --> 01:00:23,996
Winston, how many times
have I heard that word from you before?

774
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:26,666
You've had
every possible advantage.

775
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:28,876
Your mother and I have
done everything possible

776
01:00:29,043 --> 01:00:32,046
to make life easy for you.
Remember how you behaved at Eton?

777
01:00:32,213 --> 01:00:34,048
- Eton? You mean at Harrow...
- Your reports.

778
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:35,883
They've been nothing
but an embarrassment to me.

779
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:39,345
"Untidy, slovenly, bad, lazy."

780
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,017
You're my greatest
disappointment.

781
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:49,438
You lie, you shirk, you boast!

782
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:58,531
You care nothing for anyone
but yourself, Winston.

783
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:02,618
Ever since you were a child,
you've been...

784
01:01:02,785 --> 01:01:04,579
a problem to me.

785
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:08,332
Nothing but trouble
and heartache.

786
01:01:09,167 --> 01:01:11,669
What's to become of you, boy?

787
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,547
No, you're no longer a boy,
you're 20. You'll be 21...

788
01:01:14,714 --> 01:01:19,760
- No, Father, I... I'm 19.
- Don't interrupt me, Winston, please!

789
01:01:23,931 --> 01:01:26,017
Winston,

790
01:01:26,517 --> 01:01:30,313
if you do not change
your ways at Sandhurst,

791
01:01:30,521 --> 01:01:34,525
if you do not face up
to your responsibilities like a man,

792
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:37,904
if you don't buckle down, Winston,

793
01:01:39,155 --> 01:01:44,368
I can accept no further responsibility
for you after your 21st birthday.

794
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,621
If you don't change,

795
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:50,416
you'll become just another...

796
01:01:50,917 --> 01:01:54,420
public-school failure, social wastrel,

797
01:01:55,546 --> 01:02:00,927
living out a shabby and a miserable life
to the end of your days.

798
01:02:02,762 --> 01:02:06,015

<i>once I became a gentleman cadet,</i>

01:04:43,255 --> 01:04:48,803
I mean, when I have some leave,
couldn't I help your secretary?

843

I mean, you were your father's
secretary for a while and...

He's a handsome enough fellow.

846
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:07,571
The breeding's there, but there's
something lacking in the stamina.

847

You know? Character.

848
01:05:13,536 --> 01:05:16,831

01:18:34,252 --> 01:18:39,174
the Prime Minister
and Lady Randolph Churchill.

1016
01:18:39,883 --> 01:18:45,013
Say that I insist on the privilege
of selecting my own officers.

1017
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:48,225
Say, as I've already said
not once but many times before,

1018
01:18:48,391 --> 01:18:51,770
I have no room for Churchill.
None!

1019
01:18:51,937 --> 01:18:53,813
- Say that...
- Just arrived, sir.

1020
01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:55,357
Say that time grows short

1021
01:18:55,523 --> 01:18:58,401
and I have a great many
more important things to think about

1022
01:18:58,568 --> 01:19:02,614
and that the matter is closed
finally, definitely and forever.

1023
01:19:02,781 --> 01:19:06,076
And I don't want to hear
any more about it.

1024
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,287
You'll, er...
you'll dress it up, of course.

1025
01:19:09,496 --> 01:19:11,498
Certainly, sir.

01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:42,404

1033
01:19:51,538 --> 01:19:53,623

<i>ample proof of that skill.</i>

1034
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,000
Thank you.

1035
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:58,336
<i>It has also been said,</i>
<i>no doubt with malice,</i>

1036
01:19:58,503 --> 01:20:03,008
<i>that you interest yourself a great</i>
<i>deal in your son Winston's affairs,</i>

1037
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,926
<i>and in his advancement.</i>

1038
01:20:05,135 --> 01:20:07,929
But I should be a most
unnatural mother if I didn't.

1039
01:20:08,096 --> 01:20:10,056
<i>Of course.</i>

1040
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:12,976
<i>But there are those who</i>
<i>find an interesting contrast</i>

1041
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:15,312
<i>between your efforts</i>
<i>on his behalf now</i>

1042
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:19,691
<i>and your neglect of him</i>
<i>when he was a child.</i>

1043
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:23,069
Neglect?

1044
01:20:23,361 --> 01:20:26,072
But that was never the case.

1045
01:20:26,614 --> 01:20:28,450
That is vicious and hurtful.

1046
01:20:28,575 --> 01:20:31,619
My son never lacked
a mother's love.

1047
01:20:32,162 --> 01:20:36,082
Naturally, when he was a child, he went off
to school. The very best of schools.

1048
01:20:36,249 --> 01:20:38,752
At home, he had my attention
and a marvellous nanny

1049
01:20:38,918 --> 01:20:42,172
who was with us almost
from the time he was born.

1050
01:20:42,672 --> 01:20:45,842
Naturally, I was at the same time
devoted to my husband's career,

1051
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:47,635
as any wife would be.

1052
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:49,387
<i>I see.</i>

1053
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:50,889
<i>You do, on occasion,</i>

1054
01:20:51,056 --> 01:20:54,642
<i>entertain or act as hostess</i>
<i>for the Prince of Wales.</i>

1055
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:59,481
<i>His Royal Highness finds you</i>
<i>charming, gracious, amusing.</i>

1056
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:03,568
You are at liberty to think so.

1057
01:21:04,778 --> 01:21:07,447
But if you are insinuating
the slightest impropriety...

1058
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:11,910
<i>Not at all, dear lady. Not at all.</i>
<i>Please be calm.</i>

1059
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:14,079
I am perfectly calm.

1060
01:21:14,245 --> 01:21:15,789

<i>the well-known sportsman.</i>

1063
01:21:26,674 --> 01:21:29,719
I don't know what
you mean by "linked".

1064
01:21:31,012 --> 01:21:33,306
We are friends.

1065
01:21:33,473 --> 01:21:35,058
We have been friends
for many years.

1066
01:21:35,225 --> 01:21:39,145
<i>Yes, friends. Exactly. Friends.</i>

1067
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:41,981
<i>Yet, at one time, there was gossip,</i>
<i>malicious, of course,</i>

1068
01:21:42,107 --> 01:21:45,151
<i>that your marriage to Lord Randolph was,</i>
<i>shall we say,</i> pro forma,

1069
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:46,945
<i>and that in the event</i>
<i>of a divorce, you and Count...</i>

1070
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:48,780
There was never
a possibility of a divorce.

1071
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:50,949
<i>But you and Count Kinsky</i>
<i>are still friends?</i>

1072
01:21:51,074 --> 01:21:52,992
Yes.

1073
01:21:58,540 --> 01:22:01,126
Charles was married shortly
before my husband died.

1074
01:22:01,292 --> 01:22:04,921
Three weeks before,
in his own country, in Austria.

1075
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:06,756
He has remained there ever since.

1076
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:10,176
He has great responsibilities there.

1077
01:22:10,385 --> 01:22:12,637
<i>One last question.</i>

1078
01:22:12,846 --> 01:22:15,849
<i>What precisely was the nature</i>
<i>of your husband's last illness?</i>

1079
01:22:19,144 --> 01:22:21,354
It is well known.

1080
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:23,314
It was caused by overwork.

1081
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:26,151
<i>Ah, yes. But the symptoms were</i>
<i>most curious, were they not?</i>

1082
01:22:28,111 --> 01:22:29,446
I don't know what you mean.

1083
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,948
<i>But surely you were aware</i>
<i>of your husband's symptoms?</i>

1084
01:22:32,157 --> 01:22:33,575
I think this has gone far enough.

1085
01:22:33,741 --> 01:22:35,952
<i>But this is of great</i>
<i>interest to the public.</i>

1086
01:22:36,161 --> 01:22:39,289
Is it? Why should it be?

1087
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:42,125
Why should it be of any concern
to what you call the public?

1088
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:46,171
<i>The public is everyone.</i>
<i>And the public has a right to know.</i>

1089
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:49,382
Why? What right?

1090
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,676
I don't know anything
about such a right.

1091
01:22:51,843 --> 01:22:54,179
I only know about the right
to some decent privacy!

- What?
- What about young Churchill?

<i>Thank you, Mr Churchill.</i>

1218
01:37:25,549 --> 01:37:28,385
<i>There is gossip that you were</i>
<i>detested in the army,</i>

1219
01:37:28,552 --> 01:37:30,888
<i>where it is said that you were</i>
<i>known as a medal hunter,</i>

1222
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,774
Forgive me. I'm sorry.

1223
01:37:41,940 --> 01:37:44,109
I was wondering why
a certain kind of person

1224
01:37:44,276 --> 01:37:46,820
always seems to believe
the worst about me.

1225
01:37:46,987 --> 01:37:48,822
At Sandhurst, for example,
I was accused of being

1226
01:37:48,989 --> 01:37:51,367
everything from a horse thief
to a homosexual.

1227
01:37:51,575 --> 01:37:56,372
And I had to sue for libel, and win,
to prove my innocence on both counts.

1228
01:37:56,538 --> 01:37:59,917
As to what you have just said,
I'm sorry to hear it.

1229
01:38:00,084 --> 01:38:02,503
I thought I had served
my country faithfully,

1230
01:38:02,669 --> 01:38:05,464
- at some danger to myself.
<i>- Yes.</i>

1231
01:38:05,589 --> 01:38:08,967
<i>Some officers have stated that</i>
<i>your criticism of General Kitchener</i>

1232
01:38:09,134 --> 01:38:11,678
<i>in your new book,</i> The River War,
<i>was inexcusable.</i>

1233
01:38:11,970 --> 01:38:14,264
- Have you read the book?
<i>- No.</i>

1234
01:38:14,431 --> 01:38:16,392
Then perhaps you <i>should</i> read it.

1235
01:38:16,558 --> 01:38:19,770
My statements concerning
his atrocious treatment of enemy wounded

1236
01:38:19,937 --> 01:38:21,438
were entirely factual.

1237
01:38:21,605 --> 01:38:24,525
As to our victory, although
the enemy had superior numbers,

1238
01:38:24,691 --> 01:38:26,568
they were no match
for a modern army.

1239
01:38:26,735 --> 01:38:29,321
<i>I see.</i>
<i>Your father also had</i>

1240
01:38:29,488 --> 01:38:33,200
<i>a weakness for offending</i>
<i>people, did he not?</i>

1241
01:38:33,409 --> 01:38:35,661
I wouldn't call it a weakness.

1242
01:38:35,828 --> 01:38:38,038
I would describe
it as his strength.

1243
01:38:38,455 --> 01:38:41,834
And I would attribute it to the
strength of his convictions.

1244
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:45,754
My father was a brilliant man.
He had no time for fools.

1245
01:38:45,921 --> 01:38:47,214
<i>Yes. Actually,</i>

1246
01:38:47,381 --> 01:38:51,093
<i>you were not very well acquainted</i>
<i>with your father, were you?</i>

1247
01:38:51,635 --> 01:38:54,680
Not as well as I should
have liked to have been.

1248
01:38:55,097 --> 01:38:57,850
However, solitary trees,

1249
01:38:58,016 --> 01:39:00,978
if they grow at all,
grow strong.

1250
01:39:01,186 --> 01:39:04,440
<i>Indeed.</i>
<i>Something you've read?</i>

1251
01:39:04,606 --> 01:39:06,942
No. Something I have written.

1252
01:39:07,109 --> 01:39:08,694
In my new book, <i>The River War.</i>

1253
01:39:08,861 --> 01:39:11,697
You really should read it.
There are some good things in it.

1254
01:39:11,864 --> 01:39:13,866
<i>Reverting to your father's enemies,</i>

1255
01:39:14,116 --> 01:39:17,619
<i>do you imagine they will</i>
<i>welcome you into politics?</i>

1256
01:39:17,786 --> 01:39:19,830
I don't know what you
mean by "enemies".

<i>who kept him out of government.</i>

<i>Lord Salisbury. Mr Chamberlain,</i>

1259

<i>who destroyed your father's</i>
<i>last chance of returning to power.</i>

1260
01:39:29,047 --> 01:39:32,134
<i>- And the others.</i>
- They were never enemies.

1261
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:33,969
They may have disagreed at times,

1262
01:39:34,136 --> 01:39:36,555
but that's the nature
of politics, isn't it?

1263
01:39:36,722 --> 01:39:40,392
Lord Salisbury has been very kind to me.
I dedicated my book to him.

1264
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:43,312
<i>Then you feel you have no cause</i>
<i>to fight for in your father's name?</i>

1265
01:39:43,479 --> 01:39:46,940
<i>No wrong to right?</i>
<i>No vendetta to keep alive?</i>

1266
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:49,151
Vendetta?

1267
01:39:49,485 --> 01:39:54,114

<i>David Lloyd George, who is a Liberal?</i>

1269
01:39:57,659 --> 01:39:59,620
- I like people.
<i>- People who can help you?</i>

1270
01:39:59,786 --> 01:40:02,080
A young man starting out
in life needs help.

1271

<i>politics has little room</i>

1272

<i>for wealthy and privileged</i>
<i>young men?</i>

1273
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:11,298
I am not wealthy.
I live on what I earn.

1274
01:40:11,465 --> 01:40:13,675
And I support my mother
and my younger brother.

1275
01:40:13,842 --> 01:40:17,387
<i>But why exactly do you wish to stand</i>
<i>for parliament, Mr Churchill?</i>

1276
01:40:18,430 --> 01:40:20,891
- To serve my country.
<i>- And to advance yourself?</i>

1277
01:40:21,058 --> 01:40:25,145

<i>other than your ego and your ambitions?</i>

1280
01:40:34,363 --> 01:40:36,740
Only myself.

1281
01:40:36,990 --> 01:40:38,951
I believe in myself.

1282
01:40:39,117 --> 01:40:41,286

<i>Really?</i>

1284
01:40:43,247 --> 01:40:45,707
<i>Have you consulted</i>
<i>a fortune-teller recently?</i>

1285
01:40:45,874 --> 01:40:47,918
As a matter of fact, I have.

1286
01:40:48,085 --> 01:40:50,379
She agrees with me.

1287
01:40:50,587 --> 01:40:55,050
- Is it a crime to be twenty-four?
<i>- No, no. Not at all.</i>

1288
01:40:55,217 --> 01:40:58,554
What would you like me to do?
Play games?

1289
01:40:58,679 --> 01:41:00,681
Be seen but not heard?

1290
01:41:00,847 --> 01:41:02,808
Close my eyes and ears?

1291
01:41:03,016 --> 01:41:05,561
Be a child forever?

1292
01:41:05,852 --> 01:41:08,814
Must we always be ruled by old men?

1293
01:41:08,981 --> 01:41:11,108
Doesn't every old man in politics

1294
01:41:11,275 --> 01:41:14,444
betray the wonderful things
he believed in when he was young?

1295
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:18,240
And, by doing that,
betray his country?

1296
01:41:18,407 --> 01:41:20,909
I think there is room for a young man,

1297
01:41:21,076 --> 01:41:23,579
many young men, in government.

1298
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:27,708

more than ever now.

I stand here tonight

02:17:56,352 --> 02:18:01,274
It may be, at some other time,
and under other circumstances,

1757

I may take a directly
opposite position.

1758
02:18:04,360 --> 02:18:09,115

of military economy

02:18:22,253 --> 02:18:25,048
a great deal of money.

1765
02:18:30,220 --> 02:18:31,679
WINSTON:
I say it humbly,

1766
02:18:32,096 --> 02:18:35,141
but with, I hope, becoming pride,

1767
02:18:35,517 --> 02:18:39,479
no-one has a better right
to this position than I have.

1768
02:18:39,646 --> 02:18:41,981
For it is a cause
I have inherited.

1769
02:18:42,190 --> 02:18:46,069
<i>And it is a cause for which</i>
<i>the late Lord Randolph Churchill</i>

1770
02:18:46,236 --> 02:18:50,406
made the greatest sacrifice
of any minister of modern times.

1771
02:18:50,573 --> 02:18:53,117
I am glad the House
has allowed me,

1772
02:18:53,284 --> 02:18:55,954
after an interval of fifteen years,

1773
02:18:56,120 --> 02:18:59,249
to lift again the tattered flag

1774
02:18:59,415 --> 02:19:04,128
that I found lying
on a stricken field.

1775
02:19:06,005 --> 02:19:08,132
It is quite recent history.

1776
02:19:09,092 --> 02:19:12,387
Lord Randolph was
Chancellor of the Exchequer.

1777
02:19:12,554 --> 02:19:16,683
Lord Salisbury was Prime Minister,
as he is now.

1778
02:19:17,308 --> 02:19:20,311
And, on this same issue of economy,

1779
02:19:20,520 --> 02:19:24,107
Lord Randolph Churchill went down.

1780
02:19:24,315 --> 02:19:26,025
Forever.

1781
02:19:30,071 --> 02:19:33,241
But wise words, sir,

1782
02:19:33,449 --> 02:19:36,327
stand the test of time.

1783
02:19:36,536 --> 02:19:39,706
And his words were wise.

1784
02:19:41,708 --> 02:19:44,252
I have frequently been surprised,

1785
02:19:44,878 --> 02:19:47,213
since I have been in this House,

1786
02:19:47,380 --> 02:19:49,716

1787
02:19:50,091 --> 02:19:51,634
and how glibly,

1788
02:19:51,843 --> 02:19:55,305
members, and even ministers,

1789
02:19:55,471 --> 02:19:59,893
talk of a European war.

1790
02:20:00,351 --> 02:20:01,728
I say, sir,

1791
02:20:02,186 --> 02:20:05,356
we must not regard modern war

1792
02:20:05,565 --> 02:20:08,902
as a kind of game
in which we may take a hand

1793
02:20:09,110 --> 02:20:11,446

and good management

1794

come safely home with our winnings.

WINSTON:
Oh, no, sir.

1798
02:20:21,497 --> 02:20:24,876
It is no longer a game.

1799
02:20:26,127 --> 02:20:28,254
A European war

1800
02:20:28,880 --> 02:20:34,719
cannot be anything but
a cruel and heart-rending struggle

1801
02:20:34,886 --> 02:20:39,515
which, if we are ever to enjoy
the bitter fruits of victory,

1802
02:20:39,724 --> 02:20:43,102
must demand, perhaps for years,

1803
02:20:43,269 --> 02:20:46,022
the whole manhood of the nation,

1804
02:20:46,189 --> 02:20:49,150
the entire suspension
of peaceful industries,

1805
02:20:49,400 --> 02:20:52,487
and the concentrating
to only one end

1806
02:20:52,612 --> 02:20:55,990
of every vital agency
in the community.

1807

- MPs: Hear, hear!
- Ah, yes.

1808
02:20:58,743 --> 02:21:01,621
It may be that
the human race is doomed

1809
02:21:01,788 --> 02:21:04,415
never to learn from its mistakes.

1810
02:21:04,582 --> 02:21:07,752
We are the only animals
on this globe

1811
02:21:07,877 --> 02:21:11,756
who periodically set out
to slaughter each other

1812
02:21:11,923 --> 02:21:16,803
for the best, the noblest,
the most inescapable of reasons.

1813
02:21:17,095 --> 02:21:18,513
We know better,

1814
02:21:18,680 --> 02:21:23,768
but we do it again and again,
in generation after generation.

1815
02:21:23,935 --> 02:21:27,230
It may be that our
empire, too, is doomed,

1816
02:21:27,397 --> 02:21:29,983
like all those that
have gone before it

1817
02:21:30,149 --> 02:21:36,072
to continue to spill and waste
its best blood on foreign soil,

1818
02:21:36,239 --> 02:21:39,450
no matter what we say
or do in this place,

1819
02:21:39,617 --> 02:21:44,580
or think, or believe,
or have learned from history.

1820
02:21:44,789 --> 02:21:48,668
But, thank God for us,

1821
02:21:48,876 --> 02:21:53,965
there is still such a thing
as moral force.

1822
02:21:54,132 --> 02:21:57,635
And in spite of
every calumny and lie,

1823
02:21:57,802 --> 02:22:00,096
it is known that, upon the whole,

1824
02:22:00,263 --> 02:22:04,475
and it is upon the whole that
such things must be judged,

1825
02:22:04,642 --> 02:22:08,771
British influence is a healthy

1826
02:22:08,938 --> 02:22:10,940
and a kindly influence.

1827
02:22:11,357 --> 02:22:13,901
And so I say, sir,

1828
02:22:14,068 --> 02:22:18,031
at this particular
moment in history,

1829
02:22:18,156 --> 02:22:21,451
we would make a fatal bargain

1830
02:22:21,617 --> 02:22:24,704
if we allow the moral force

1831
02:22:24,871 --> 02:22:28,332
which this country
has for so long exerted

1832

or perhaps destroyed,

<i>The</i> Morning Post<i>, London.</i>

1845
02:23:31,020 --> 02:23:33,397
<i>"Mr Winston Churchill,</i>
<i>last night served notice</i>

1846
02:23:33,564 --> 02:23:36,025
<i>"that there is a young lion</i>
<i>loose in the House</i>

1847
02:23:36,192 --> 02:23:38,236
<i>"and the lion has sharp claws."</i>

1848
02:23:38,402 --> 02:23:40,404
Well, well. Hmm.

1849
02:23:41,531 --> 02:23:44,450
I deeply suspect what you've
done tonight, and yet...

1850
02:23:44,617 --> 02:23:47,411
I have to believe you were
completely sincere.

1851
02:23:47,495 --> 02:23:49,705
And very brave.

1852
02:23:52,041 --> 02:23:53,793
You know, Churchill,

1853
02:23:53,918 --> 02:23:57,171
you're a child of your class,
and you may never outgrow it.

1854
02:23:59,674 --> 02:24:01,926
But you've got something.

1855
02:24:13,729 --> 02:24:15,815
(INAUDIBLE)

1856
02:24:18,234 --> 02:24:21,696

1857
02:24:27,910 --> 02:24:28,995
(DOOR CLOSING)

1858
02:24:29,078 --> 02:24:30,329
Congratulations.

1859
02:24:31,998 --> 02:24:33,749
Thank you.

1860
02:24:34,250 --> 02:24:36,961
I looked for you, but,
when I couldn't find you,

1861
02:24:37,795 --> 02:24:39,839
I thought you might be here.

1862
02:24:43,801 --> 02:24:45,595
Well...

1863
02:24:47,388 --> 02:24:49,182
do you think I still have a career?

1864
02:24:50,975 --> 02:24:53,102
We shall have to wait
and see, won't we?

1865
02:24:55,104 --> 02:24:56,606
Hmm.

1866
02:24:59,192 --> 02:25:01,194
How do you feel?

1867
02:25:01,402 --> 02:25:03,029
Tired.

1868
02:25:04,113 --> 02:25:05,448
Tired, but free.

1869
02:25:07,325 --> 02:25:10,244
It's odd. I feel free.

1870
02:25:13,539 --> 02:25:14,999
Sorry, darling, a brandy?

1871
02:25:15,583 --> 02:25:16,667
No.

1872
02:25:20,296 --> 02:25:22,089
I don't know.

1873
02:25:25,051 --> 02:25:26,636
It's like when I escaped.

1874
02:25:28,012 --> 02:25:30,681
When I first knew I was really free.

1875
02:25:32,600 --> 02:25:34,435
It's odd.

1876
02:25:39,148 --> 02:25:41,192
Oh, Mother...

1877
02:25:42,151 --> 02:25:44,528
I saw a girl tonight.

1878
02:25:44,695 --> 02:25:46,405
Tall, fair-haired.

1879
02:25:46,572 --> 02:25:48,908
Rather lovely, I thought.

1880
02:25:49,116 --> 02:25:50,868
Dressed in pale yellow, I think.

1881
02:25:51,535 --> 02:25:54,497
You didn't see anyone like that
in the gallery, did you?

1882
02:25:56,707 --> 02:25:58,251
Yes.

1883
02:25:58,459 --> 02:26:01,963
There was one young woman
who more or less fits that description.

1884
02:26:02,964 --> 02:26:04,090
Oh?

1885
02:26:04,715 --> 02:26:06,759
Well, you know everyone.
You wouldn't, um...?

1886
02:26:09,178 --> 02:26:13,057
Well, yes.
As a matter of fact, I do.

1887
02:26:13,224 --> 02:26:15,768
You must mean
Clementine Hozier.

1888
02:26:15,935 --> 02:26:19,438
Your Uncle Jack Leslie almost dropped her
in the font when she was christened.

1889
02:26:19,605 --> 02:26:21,315
Oh.

1890
02:26:21,482 --> 02:26:25,152
- Did he, now?
- Yes.

1891
02:26:28,781 --> 02:26:30,449
CHURCHILL:
<i>It was an end,</i>

1892
02:26:30,616 --> 02:26:33,119
<i>and a beginning.</i>

1893
02:26:33,369 --> 02:26:36,914
<i>My darling mother</i>
<i>continued on her headlong,</i>

1894
02:26:37,123 --> 02:26:41,752
<i>headstrong, but always</i>
<i>gallant and courageous way</i>

1895
02:26:41,919 --> 02:26:44,463
<i>whilst, seven years later,</i>

1896
02:26:44,630 --> 02:26:48,050
<i>Clementine Hozier and I were married,</i>

1897
02:26:48,259 --> 02:26:52,179
<i>and lived happily ever afterwards.</i>

1898
