00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:23,627
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

2
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:26,367
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

3
00:01:26,407 --> 00:01:29,638
Our obligation is to reduce
our bloated government...

4
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:32,111
but at the same time,
restore its creative power...

5
00:01:32,146 --> 00:01:34,307
to reinvigorate our society--

6
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:37,650
My name is Jay Bulworth.

7
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:40,745
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

8
00:01:40,788 --> 00:01:43,518
Our obligation--

9
00:01:43,557 --> 00:01:45,457
California families
who live by the rules...

10
00:01:45,493 --> 00:01:47,324
and work hard
and pay their taxes...

11
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:49,522
shouldn't be paying
for people who do nothing.

12
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:51,827
I'm Jay Bulworth.

13
00:01:51,866 --> 00:01:54,096
I believe in a hand up,
not a hand down.

14
00:01:54,135 --> 00:01:56,569
I need your support on Tuesday.

15
00:01:58,572 --> 00:01:59,732
I'm Jay Bulworth.

16
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:02,265
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

17
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,245
I'll fight to end unnecessary
affirmative action programs.

18
00:02:05,279 --> 00:02:06,439
I'm Jay Bulworth.

19
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,779
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

20
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,648
Our obligation is to reduce--

21
00:02:11,686 --> 00:02:14,314
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

22
00:02:14,355 --> 00:02:16,482
Our welfare system
is out of control.

23
00:02:16,524 --> 00:02:18,116
Of course we should help...

24
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,888
My name is Jay Bulworth.

25
00:02:19,927 --> 00:02:21,758
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

26
00:02:21,796 --> 00:02:25,232
My wife Connie and I
have been married for 24 years.

27
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,996
She's been a loving partner,
and more importantly...

28
00:02:28,035 --> 00:02:29,866
Connie's been my friend.

29
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,895
Jay has been a great
senator for California...

30
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:35,932
but the best job he's done is
as a loving husband and father.

31
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:37,705
I believe
in the old-fashioned values...

32
00:02:37,745 --> 00:02:40,441
of honesty and decency
and fidelity.

33
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:42,608
Join me in my crusade...

34
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,175
to strengthen
California's families.

35
00:02:47,154 --> 00:02:49,884
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

36
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:53,416
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

37
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:54,792
I'm Jay Bulworth.

38
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:56,956
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

39
00:02:56,997 --> 00:02:59,465
We can't afford any longer
to give people privileges...

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,967
on the basis of race.

41
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,731
It's time we realized
discrimination in the past...

42
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:06,467
doesn't justify discrimination
in the future.

43
00:03:06,507 --> 00:03:09,067
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

44
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,238
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

45
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:14,144
Our welfare system
is out of control.

46
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:16,649
Of course we should help
families who truly need it...

47
00:03:16,684 --> 00:03:19,847
but too often, welfare
is a permanent subsidy...

48
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,980
for able-bodied people
who could and should...

49
00:03:22,022 --> 00:03:23,546
Hello, I'm Jay Bulworth.

50
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,685
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

51
00:03:26,727 --> 00:03:30,458
Our obligation is to reduce
our bloated government...

52
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:32,056
I'm Jay Bulworth.

53
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,329
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

54
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:37,235
It's time we realized
discrimination in the past...

55
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,899
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:42,465
Of course we should help
families who truly need it.

57
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:44,341
I'm Jay Bulworth.

58
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,471
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

59
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:48,675
Our obligation is to reduce...

60
00:03:48,716 --> 00:03:49,876
I'm Jay Bulworth.

61
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:52,283
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

62
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,082
We can't afford any longer
to give people--

63
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,054
I'll fight to end unnecessary
affirmative action programs--

64
00:04:00,094 --> 00:04:01,925
Hello, this is
a telephone answering machine.

65
00:04:01,962 --> 00:04:03,122
Leave a message at the beep.

66
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,931
If you're there,
pick up the goddamn telephone.

67
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:09,162
I know you're there.

68
00:04:09,203 --> 00:04:10,932
Pork bellies, indeed.

69
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:14,668
I've just spoken with Hong Kong
again, and I'm very upset!

70
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:16,699
That's the wrong word.
I'm pissed, pissed...

71
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:18,735
pissed, pissed, pissed, pissed!

72
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:20,337
I warned you repeatedly
about Fenner.

73
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,248
That son of a bitch and
his pork belly goddamn schemes.

74
00:04:23,284 --> 00:04:26,048
And now he tells me--

75
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:29,783
He tells me you've invested
nearly everything you had...

76
00:04:29,824 --> 00:04:32,349
and they're selling
the goddamn things short.

77
00:04:32,393 --> 00:04:33,690
We got the check.

78
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:36,696
The senator would just love
to have drinks with the sultan.

79
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:38,925
Will the sultan be
in Beverly Hills?

80
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:40,934
- Has he buzzed yet?
- No.

81
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:42,435
Feldman call?

82
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,995
It's 6:15 in the morning in L.A.

83
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,132
I don't care.
Get me Liebowitz and Macavoy.

84
00:04:47,174 --> 00:04:50,109
I only got two hands.
I'm too old to grow a third.

85
00:04:50,144 --> 00:04:51,975
I didn't ask you
to grow anything new.

86
00:04:52,012 --> 00:04:53,536
Just get me the calls.

87
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:55,742
And Mr. Chow?
What about Mr. Ling?

88
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:57,546
Tell me, did his check clear?

89
00:05:00,488 --> 00:05:02,615
Hey, Senator.

90
00:05:02,656 --> 00:05:03,884
It's a beautiful morning.

91
00:05:03,924 --> 00:05:06,392
The birds are singing.
The leaves are...

92
00:05:08,095 --> 00:05:10,325
doing whatever leaves do.

93
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:11,490
Did you eat anything?

94
00:05:11,532 --> 00:05:13,830
It's Friday.
That pizza's from Wednesday.

95
00:05:13,868 --> 00:05:15,233
Ahem.

96
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,530
Fenner call?

97
00:05:18,706 --> 00:05:21,470
He said you sold pork bellies
short, and now they're up again.

98
00:05:21,509 --> 00:05:24,342
I mean, is that a disaster?

99
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:28,747
Davers, do I look like
a disaster to you?

100
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,079
Good morning.

101
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:31,744
The poll's
worse than we thought.

102
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:33,184
We're down by four points...

103
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,280
but the new spots
are playing absolutely huge...

104
00:05:36,323 --> 00:05:38,587
and we'll get 900 grand
from the Sunday brunch.

105
00:05:38,626 --> 00:05:41,686
You might be asked about that
insurance bill in five minutes.

106
00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:42,696
Which insurance bill?

107
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,028
S2720--
regulates insurance companies.

108
00:05:45,065 --> 00:05:46,396
Makes them sell it
to poor people.

109
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,991
That's a good bill.

110
00:05:48,035 --> 00:05:49,263
Not for insurance companies.

111
00:05:49,303 --> 00:05:51,032
What, are we working
for the insurance companies?

112
00:05:51,071 --> 00:05:53,062
We do today, or Tuesday,
we don't work for anybody.

113
00:05:53,107 --> 00:05:54,438
We're trying to get
50 grand a table.

114
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:56,340
Should we talk on the way?

115
00:05:56,377 --> 00:05:58,402
Senator, Missy Berliner,
Los Angeles Times.

116
00:05:58,445 --> 00:05:59,571
Sam.

117
00:05:59,613 --> 00:06:03,174
Senator, your challenger
in next Tuesday's primary...

118
00:06:03,217 --> 00:06:06,550
said you were, quote,
"an old liberal wine...

119
00:06:06,587 --> 00:06:09,488
"trying to pour himself
into a new conservative bottle."

120
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:12,583
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

121
00:06:13,894 --> 00:06:16,089
- That kind of mistake can hurt.
- What mistake?

122
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:18,621
The both sides remark.
Hello, Constance.

123
00:06:18,666 --> 00:06:21,430
I don't know
why your people would think...

124
00:06:21,468 --> 00:06:25,097
I have nothing better to do
than wait around.

125
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:27,403
I have no objection
to doing my part...

126
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:29,534
but the least you can do
is to get your staff...

127
00:06:29,577 --> 00:06:31,306
to show some respect
for my time.

128
00:06:31,345 --> 00:06:34,803
Uh-huh.
What about both sides?

129
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:36,645
It was Bob Sheer, right?

130
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:39,619
Weren't we supposed to go with
"We'll get back to you, Bob?"

131
00:06:39,653 --> 00:06:44,056
"Both sides" implies the other
side is worth considering.

132
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:46,685
- Where's Becky?
- She doesn't want a photo op.

133
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:48,752
She's 17. She wants
to be with her friends.

134
00:06:48,796 --> 00:06:50,024
Is she mad at me?

135
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,964
She's not mad. She's 17.

136
00:06:51,999 --> 00:06:53,796
Just send her money.
She'll be fine.

137
00:06:53,834 --> 00:06:55,529
Smile in the back, please.

138
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:56,661
OK, that's it.

139
00:06:56,704 --> 00:06:58,228
Uh, Con--Uh...

140
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,932
We want to thank you all
for your help.

141
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:05,173
Any other help, please
make payable to Bulworth '96.

142
00:07:06,347 --> 00:07:08,406
Serum cholesterol,
folate level...

143
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:10,849
liver function, blood pressure,
EKG-- they're all fine.

144
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,445
Are you eating?

145
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:14,784
Uh, no, thanks.

146
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:19,350
No, I'm asking, have you
experienced a loss of appetite?

147
00:07:19,393 --> 00:07:21,793
No, no, no.
I'm just not very hungry.

148
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,421
When was the last time you ate?

149
00:07:23,464 --> 00:07:26,763
Mr. Fong
and the Chung family left.

150
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,290
Will Mr. and Mrs. Wang
be in California?

151
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:30,394
Hello, Helen, how are you?

152
00:07:30,437 --> 00:07:32,997
- Hello, Mr. Crockett.
- Hello, Mrs. Dobish.

153
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,634
Mr. Crockett,
American Insurance Federation.

154
00:07:35,676 --> 00:07:38,144
Jay. Jay.

155
00:07:38,178 --> 00:07:42,205
Are you telling me you haven't
eaten or slept in three days?

156
00:07:42,249 --> 00:07:43,375
That's not good.

157
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,885
Maybe you should talk
to someone.

158
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,012
I'll give you a name.
Milton Alexander.

159
00:07:48,055 --> 00:07:50,182
He's head of Psychiatry
at Georgetown.

160
00:07:50,224 --> 00:07:51,521
Uh, I got a meeting here.

161
00:07:51,558 --> 00:07:53,321
This bill will devastate us.

162
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,918
- It will be--
- Crockett.

163
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,226
Can I call you back?

164
00:07:56,359 --> 00:07:58,224
Doc, how's he doing?

165
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,126
Fine. Fine.

166
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,131
- How are you doing?
- Fine, fine. You?

167
00:08:02,165 --> 00:08:04,827
- Fine.
- Fine.

168
00:08:06,336 --> 00:08:09,464
Can you believe
this goddamn regulation bill?

169
00:08:09,506 --> 00:08:11,701
Is the whole world going insane?

170
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,232
When you consider
the dislocation...

171
00:08:14,277 --> 00:08:16,939
in the relationships
with the state commissioners...

172
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,106
or the effect
on the rate structure...

173
00:08:18,148 --> 00:08:20,446
This bill's
gonna cost us billions.

174
00:08:20,484 --> 00:08:22,884
And it's the usual people
making trouble.

175
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:24,716
You think I'm gonna say
it's the African Americans.

176
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,018
It's not the African Americans.

177
00:08:27,057 --> 00:08:29,525
I have no problem
with African Americans.

178
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:30,856
I'm not other people.

179
00:08:30,894 --> 00:08:34,261
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Colin Powell, Michael Jordan--

180
00:08:34,297 --> 00:08:37,664
I have no problem with them.
They have good jobs.

181
00:08:37,701 --> 00:08:40,568
But you throw down
some lazy, welfare-taking...

182
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,629
drug-dealing,
rap-singing punk...

183
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:46,472
and tell me my people
have to give him a policy. Why?

184
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:50,469
So he can burn down his house?
Or smoke crack and get AIDS?

185
00:08:50,514 --> 00:08:53,483
You can't get AIDS
by burning your house down.

186
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:55,485
We got
the broadcasters, insurance...

187
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,111
A.M.A... Buddhists?

188
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,484
What about the Buddhists?

189
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:01,855
Vinnie! Ha ha ha ha!

190
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:05,225
Vinnie, you son of a bitch,
how are you?

191
00:09:06,363 --> 00:09:07,489
How you been?

192
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,125
Other than the prostate
like a coffee cake...

193
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:12,430
a little ticker trouble--
terrific.

194
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,131
To use an overworked phrase,
this bill is--

195
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,036
The bill is un-American.

196
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:19,098
And I have
total confidence in you...

197
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:22,578
that you can bottle up this bill
in committee.

198
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:23,840
What have we got there?

199
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,711
Oh, I got
your homeowner's insurance...

200
00:09:25,749 --> 00:09:28,946
disability insurance,
umbrella, liability...

201
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:30,782
and I see no reason
why you shouldn't have...

202
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,617
a couple million dollars
in life insurance.

203
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:34,715
I thought we said ten.

204
00:09:34,758 --> 00:09:37,158
- What?
- Ten. Ten million.

205
00:09:37,193 --> 00:09:38,660
Pesos?

206
00:09:38,695 --> 00:09:40,526
Senator-- Ha ha ha.

207
00:09:40,564 --> 00:09:44,523
I feel constrained to remind you
that what we said was...

208
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:46,399
a couple of million
paid to your daughter--

209
00:09:46,436 --> 00:09:47,960
Four payments,
2.5 million each...

210
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,972
ten million dollars
to my daughter.

211
00:09:52,409 --> 00:09:54,343
Would five do it?

212
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:57,510
Why don't we just say seven?

213
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:03,745
Ten million.
That's a lot of life insurance.

214
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:10,424
If Jay Bulworth plays ball,
we'll play ball.

215
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:13,496
Oh, Senator,
I want you to meet Vinnie.

216
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,828
Vinnie, how are you?

217
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,925
Ready for the weekend
research project?

218
00:10:18,969 --> 00:10:20,596
Davers, could you excuse us?
Thanks.

219
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,834
Uh, all right, Senator,
I'll be right outside.

220
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:27,341
Tell her we need
U.S. American dollars.

221
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:29,242
Small bills.

222
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,770
I wish I didn't have to go
through Davers to talk to you.

223
00:10:31,815 --> 00:10:34,807
Davers can always reach me.
Davers is a sweetheart.

224
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:36,842
Did Davers ask you...

225
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,854
what the weekend
research project was?

226
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,480
Uh-uh.

227
00:10:40,523 --> 00:10:42,923
Good.
Nobody knows but you and me.

228
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,256
You and me, Senator.

229
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:45,420
That's good.

230
00:10:45,462 --> 00:10:46,690
Here's a couple of pictures
of the person.

231
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,461
Give them to whomever
is gonna do the, uh...

232
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,196
- Research.
- Research.

233
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:55,033
This is the first time...

234
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,335
I've ever arranged
to get a guy to off a guy...

235
00:10:57,374 --> 00:10:59,842
who I don't know who the guy is
who he's gonna off.

236
00:10:59,876 --> 00:11:01,002
You mean, research.

237
00:11:01,044 --> 00:11:03,410
Yeah, research a guy
who I don't know who it is.

238
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:04,913
You said
you didn't have to know.

239
00:11:04,948 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm just the liaison. I don't
want to know who this is...

240
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:10,680
and I don't want nobody knowin'
nothin' about me.

241
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,210
I need to talk to you,
I call Eddie Davers.

242
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,813
You need to talk to me,
you call Eddie Davers.

243
00:11:13,857 --> 00:11:15,620
That way nobody knows nothin'.

244
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:17,058
- Fine.
- Except for one thing.

245
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,890
- What's that?
- I gotta know who this guy is.

246
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:22,887
- You just said--
- But that was in the abstract.

247
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,331
Now that we're really
doin' it...

248
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:27,803
and you don't tell me
who this is, and then, uh...

249
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:29,304
Simple math.

250
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,434
Take a look.

251
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,989
Excuse me.

252
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:51,553
What's the gag?

253
00:11:51,594 --> 00:11:53,619
He will be arriving at LAX...

254
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:57,599
tomorrow night at 8:40
on American Airlines.

255
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,226
A check for the second half
of the money.

256
00:12:01,271 --> 00:12:04,729
If I'm not dead by Monday,
I stop payment on that check.

257
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,346
Thank you for flying with us.

258
00:12:19,389 --> 00:12:21,914
Have a pleasant stay
in Los Angeles.

259
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:24,984
As you exit the aircraft,
our flight agents...

260
00:12:25,028 --> 00:12:27,622
will help direct you
to any connecting flights.

261
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:30,064
Oh, and have a nice day.

262
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,466
Welcome back.
Did you sleep on the plane?

263
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,096
We're running late, so let me
run through some changes.

264
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:37,072
By the way,
excellent work with Crockett.

265
00:12:37,107 --> 00:12:39,007
The final haul
from the Sunday brunch is 1.1.

266
00:12:39,042 --> 00:12:40,441
Insurance came up with 250.

267
00:12:40,477 --> 00:12:43,105
We got two from oil, banks
are in for one and a half...

268
00:12:43,146 --> 00:12:45,137
A.M.A. and the lawyers
came in just south of 100.

269
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:49,743
Gloria Allred got very excited
over your O.J. statement.

270
00:12:49,786 --> 00:12:52,721
Even the women have coughed up.
Came in with about 65.

271
00:12:52,756 --> 00:12:54,519
We do have a new schedule.

272
00:12:54,557 --> 00:12:57,583
We have a black church,
and then we have Beverly Hills.

273
00:12:57,627 --> 00:12:59,458
He's here.

274
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:02,192
It'd be nice later
to have a drink with the sultan.

275
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,358
The guy is nuts.

276
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,593
Welcome home, Senator.

277
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:06,602
- What's this?
- I told you.

278
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,126
Twenty-four hours
on the campaign trail.

279
00:13:08,171 --> 00:13:11,572
This is Gary Plunkett of C-SPAN.

280
00:13:11,608 --> 00:13:13,576
And Fred Tinsdale
and Mimi Binder.

281
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,670
How you doing?
Mimi and I are gonna be...

282
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,613
right behind you
in the truck, Senator.

283
00:13:18,648 --> 00:13:19,842
Fred, get in the truck.

284
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:22,579
So, C-SPAN
is gonna be with us all night?

285
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,519
All weekend.
Tonight's installment...

286
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:26,283
airs tomorrow afternoon at 2:00.

287
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:27,482
Where are we going?

288
00:13:27,524 --> 00:13:31,790
First stop, we are going
down to South Central.

289
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:34,626
Did you get a copy
of the schedule?

290
00:13:34,664 --> 00:13:36,291
We're gonna be on the go.

291
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,994
First stop is South Central and
the African-American community.

292
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:41,026
Gee, your African-American
constituents...

293
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,662
down in South Central...

294
00:13:42,705 --> 00:13:44,502
don't forget what you've done
for them, do they?

295
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:45,667
Where we going?

296
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,733
Down to Grace Church.

297
00:13:47,777 --> 00:13:49,404
- Fred.
- What?

298
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,140
Did you say
you'd covered Bulworth before?

299
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,376
Yeah.
These things go by the book.

300
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,077
Then over to Beverly Hills...

301
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:58,087
to meet some big names
in the entertainment business.

302
00:14:13,236 --> 00:14:15,136
Scotty, how are you?

303
00:14:15,171 --> 00:14:18,971
Vivian, Rwanda,
I didn't expect you to be here.

304
00:14:19,008 --> 00:14:21,408
Those key chains look fantastic.

305
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,742
How you feeling, Senator?

306
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,415
Get any sleep on the plane?

307
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,041
Has Mr. Murphy
forgotten something?

308
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,311
Mr. Murphy, the senator?

309
00:14:32,355 --> 00:14:33,515
Whoops.

310
00:14:33,556 --> 00:14:36,320
Senator? Senator Bulworth.

311
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,518
Senator...

312
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,960
The honorable senator
from California...

313
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:43,124
the Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.

314
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,293
- Yay!
- Yay!

315
00:14:45,335 --> 00:14:47,633
Hey, that's a nice
little piece of timing.

316
00:14:48,738 --> 00:14:50,865
Amen.

317
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:53,341
Senator, your speech, sir.

318
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:56,642
Amen!

319
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:12,082
We stand at the doorstep
of a new millennium.

320
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:15,315
Listen to this.
I put a little time in on this.

321
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:18,290
And at the same time,
restore its creative power...

322
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:20,520
to reinvigorate our society...

323
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:25,555
And, uh...

324
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:30,762
bring about a, uh, rebirth
of, uh, democracy, uh...

325
00:15:32,038 --> 00:15:33,198
Any questions?

326
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,538
Nice. Less is more.

327
00:15:35,575 --> 00:15:38,043
When the riots went down
four years ago...

328
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,911
you promised us
federal funding to rebuild.

329
00:15:40,947 --> 00:15:42,278
What happened?

330
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,450
What happened was...

331
00:15:51,491 --> 00:15:53,721
we all knew
that was gonna be big news...

332
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,787
so we all came down here--
Bush, Clinton, Wilson--

333
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,231
got our pictures taken, told you
what you wanted to hear...

334
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:02,098
and we pretty much
forgot about it.

335
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,966
Ha ha ha!

336
00:16:08,074 --> 00:16:09,302
Did you hear that?

337
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,173
Let's see where he's going.

338
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:15,375
We can't get health insurance,
fire insurance, life insurance.

339
00:16:15,415 --> 00:16:18,213
Why haven't you come out
for Senate Bill 2720?

340
00:16:18,251 --> 00:16:23,484
Because you haven't contributed
any money to my campaign.

341
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:28,459
You know how much insurance
companies come up with?

342
00:16:28,495 --> 00:16:31,293
They depend on me
to get a bill like that...

343
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:33,697
and bottle it up in committee
during an election...

344
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,167
and then we can kill it
when you're not looking.

345
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:39,137
When you say "by the book,"
what book would that be?

346
00:16:39,172 --> 00:16:42,767
So the Democrats
don't care about us?

347
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:43,935
Isn't that obvious?

348
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:47,879
Half your kids are out of work
and the other half are in jail.

349
00:16:47,914 --> 00:16:51,372
Do you see any Democrat
doing anything about it?

350
00:16:51,418 --> 00:16:52,612
Certainly not me.

351
00:16:53,954 --> 00:16:56,047
What are you going to do,
vote Republican?

352
00:16:56,089 --> 00:16:59,024
Come on. You're not
gonna vote Republican.

353
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:02,119
Let's call a spade a spade.

354
00:17:02,162 --> 00:17:05,325
I mean, you can have
a Billion Man March.

355
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,458
If you don't put down
that malt liquor...

356
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,936
and stop backing a running back
who stabs his wife...

357
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,804
you're never gonna
get rid of somebody like me.

358
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,044
Fire! Fire! Fire!

359
00:17:21,181 --> 00:17:23,741
Yo, fire alarm!
Nina, let's be out.

360
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,954
Fire!

361
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,785
Right this way, Senator.

362
00:17:31,825 --> 00:17:32,951
What are you doing?

363
00:17:32,993 --> 00:17:36,156
That was good.
That was really good.

364
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,221
Fire!

365
00:17:38,264 --> 00:17:40,926
Does anybody know
where the fire actually is?

366
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:43,197
Where's the fire?

367
00:17:43,236 --> 00:17:45,397
Does anybody know
exactly where the fire is?

368
00:17:45,438 --> 00:17:48,896
I find it very worrying
that in 1990 Los Angeles...

369
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,239
churches are burning.

370
00:17:50,276 --> 00:17:52,574
Smell smoke? I don't smell shit.

371
00:17:52,612 --> 00:17:54,807
If there's a fire,
I don't know where it is.

372
00:17:54,848 --> 00:17:56,509
We have to be running along.

373
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:57,709
Coming through. Thank you.

374
00:17:57,751 --> 00:18:00,743
Hey, Senator! Listen, hon.

375
00:18:00,787 --> 00:18:03,517
Like what she said.
We into politics.

376
00:18:03,556 --> 00:18:06,320
We want to work
on your campaign.

377
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:09,692
We need some jobs volunteering.
I don't mind volunteering.

378
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:12,357
It's on to Beverly Hills
on our new schedule...

379
00:18:12,399 --> 00:18:15,027
and our friends the Liebowitzes.

380
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:17,628
We're into
that whole political-- Nina.

381
00:18:17,671 --> 00:18:20,731
To prevent any damage
to this wonderful landmark...

382
00:18:20,774 --> 00:18:23,299
- Yo.
- Yo. Yo to you.

383
00:18:23,343 --> 00:18:26,176
- Later.
- I was hoping for sooner.

384
00:18:26,212 --> 00:18:29,045
- What'd you say?
- Later is good.

385
00:18:29,082 --> 00:18:30,379
You tryin' to mack on my sister?

386
00:18:30,417 --> 00:18:33,614
There's no macking
going on here, young man.

387
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:36,451
I really think
we should be on our way.

388
00:18:36,489 --> 00:18:38,184
We should go.

389
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:41,250
Feldman, my friends here
would like to volunteer.

390
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,454
What can you help us with?

391
00:18:42,495 --> 00:18:45,225
It's a shame we didn't get
into the heart of your remarks.

392
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:49,402
You want to volunteer?

393
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:51,996
You've always had tremendous
support in this district.

394
00:18:52,038 --> 00:18:54,438
Come on, that Nina. Woof!

395
00:18:54,474 --> 00:18:55,771
Oh, yes.

396
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:56,969
Woof! Woof!

397
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,036
Never underestimate
the value of a frank exchange.

398
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,243
- What does "mack" mean?
- Mack?

399
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:05,808
Macavoy, what does mack mean?
Gary, do you know?

400
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:07,979
Like, "You're macking
on my sister"?

401
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:10,990
For you to be running
against Hugh Weldie...

402
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,289
who has just leapt on
the neoconservative bandwagon--

403
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:24,897
Uh, is your sciatic nerve
bothering you again?

404
00:19:24,938 --> 00:19:27,236
No, no, no, I'm fine.

405
00:19:28,274 --> 00:19:30,674
Several of our people
find Weldie's duplicity...

406
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,177
particularly, uh...

407
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:35,643
You've had such a tough day.

408
00:19:35,682 --> 00:19:37,673
What do you say we get you
some downtime?

409
00:19:37,717 --> 00:19:39,207
I could cover for you
at the Liebowitzes'.

410
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:40,879
- Are you kidding me?
- Absolutely.

411
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,888
After all the money
we've worked these guys for?

412
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:45,186
We get more money from
these jokers than the Chinese.

413
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:49,184
I'll tell you what.
I've got an idea. Pull over.

414
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:52,062
Gary, what do you say you and I
and your colleagues...

415
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:53,429
head on over to headquarters?

416
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,195
That is a good idea. Great.

417
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,998
Let's do that. Come on, Gar.

418
00:19:57,036 --> 00:19:59,266
And we'll see you
in Beverly Hills.

419
00:19:59,305 --> 00:20:00,567
That is a good idea.

420
00:20:00,607 --> 00:20:02,472
Gary, this is gonna be
much better.

421
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:03,874
You are gonna get
a behind-the-scenes look...

422
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,639
at how a campaign
actually operates.

423
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:07,407
You eat on the plane, Senator?

424
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:08,573
No.

425
00:20:08,615 --> 00:20:10,674
- How long since you ate?
- Wednesday.

426
00:20:10,717 --> 00:20:12,309
Ha ha ha!

427
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:14,616
Pull in here, will you?
I'm starving.

428
00:20:14,654 --> 00:20:16,212
Let's get some chicken wings.

429
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,384
Frankly, this is getting
uncomfortable for me.

430
00:20:19,425 --> 00:20:21,723
A third of the guests
have left already.

431
00:20:21,761 --> 00:20:23,319
A third of the guests are drunk.

432
00:20:23,363 --> 00:20:25,331
When do you think he'll be here?

433
00:20:25,365 --> 00:20:26,525
I think he'll be here
any second.

434
00:20:26,566 --> 00:20:27,692
You do?

435
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:29,031
He's had such a day.

436
00:20:29,068 --> 00:20:32,231
The senator is helping
the state department...

437
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,206
work out details
on a new guarantee.

438
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,333
A new guarantee? I'm sorry.

439
00:20:36,376 --> 00:20:38,776
The West Bank.
You didn't hear it from me.

440
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:39,938
The West Bank.

441
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:41,003
He'll be here any second.

442
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:43,481
Yo, Senator Bulworth.

443
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:46,383
Here we are--volunteer valets.

444
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:48,444
Manny and Dorothy Liebowitz.

445
00:20:48,488 --> 00:20:51,457
Hello. It's good to see you.

446
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:55,154
Sid Sheinberg and Lew Wasserman
had to leave...

447
00:20:55,195 --> 00:20:58,358
but I'm sure they'd agree
the security of the West Bank...

448
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:01,162
is more important
than you being on time.

449
00:21:01,201 --> 00:21:02,668
I was just grabbing a bite.

450
00:21:02,702 --> 00:21:03,862
Come in.

451
00:21:03,903 --> 00:21:06,133
We'll be out shortly.

452
00:21:06,172 --> 00:21:09,107
We can't ask the Liebowitzes
to throw open their doors...

453
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,235
to a national
television audience, can we?

454
00:21:11,277 --> 00:21:13,973
Nonsense.
Mi casa es su casa, huh?

455
00:21:14,013 --> 00:21:15,571
Yes!

456
00:21:15,615 --> 00:21:17,810
Oh, miss, um...

457
00:21:17,851 --> 00:21:20,217
Thank you very much.

458
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:23,416
Do you think those of us
in the entertainment business...

459
00:21:23,456 --> 00:21:25,515
need government help
in determining limits...

460
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:27,458
on the amount
of sex and violence...

461
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:29,393
in today's films
and television programs?

462
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:33,456
You know, the funny thing
is how, uh...

463
00:21:40,773 --> 00:21:42,240
lousy most of your stuff is.

464
00:21:42,275 --> 00:21:44,641
You make violent films
and dirty films...

465
00:21:44,677 --> 00:21:47,111
and you make family films...

466
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,011
but most of 'em
are not very good, are they?

467
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:51,243
It's funny
that so many smart people...

468
00:21:51,284 --> 00:21:54,276
could work so hard and
spend all that money...

469
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,651
and make so much money on 'em...

470
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:57,519
What do you think it is?

471
00:21:57,557 --> 00:21:59,855
It must be the money, huh?

472
00:21:59,893 --> 00:22:01,258
It turns everything to crap.

473
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:04,092
But how much money
do you guys really need?

474
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:05,927
I mean...

475
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:09,992
you be honest with me,
and don't spare my feelings.

476
00:22:10,036 --> 00:22:12,146
Do you have any more
of the crispy crab cakes?

477
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:14,770
Wait! Just wait a minute.

478
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:16,077
Aah!

479
00:22:17,451 --> 00:22:19,851
Do you think
it's advisable...

480
00:22:19,887 --> 00:22:22,583
to schedule campaign stops
with industry leaders...

481
00:22:22,623 --> 00:22:25,956
when you have such
a low opinion of their product?

482
00:22:35,302 --> 00:22:36,963
My guys are not stupid.

483
00:22:37,004 --> 00:22:39,199
They always put the big Jews
on my schedule.

484
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,038
You're mostly Jews here, right?
Three out of four anyway.

485
00:22:42,076 --> 00:22:44,374
Excuse me?

486
00:22:44,412 --> 00:22:47,643
I bet Murphy put something bad
about Farrakhan in here for you.

487
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:50,206
Thank you, Senator.

488
00:22:50,251 --> 00:22:52,913
I know I speak for you
when I say I'm energized...

489
00:22:52,953 --> 00:22:55,046
by your--
this kind of give and take.

490
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:58,581
Can you play that
crispy crab cakes remark again?

491
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,625
Hey!

492
00:23:01,662 --> 00:23:03,459
Oh, great.

493
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:07,297
I think everybody
was challenged by your candor.

494
00:23:07,334 --> 00:23:09,234
Let Bob Dole put that
in his pipe and smoke it.

495
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:11,795
Just get out!
All of you are fired!

496
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,466
Fuck you! We are volunteers.

497
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:17,034
The senator's
gonna go to his hotel and sleep.

498
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:19,637
We stayed
too long already. We out!

499
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,841
- You girls want a ride?
- Yeah!

500
00:23:21,882 --> 00:23:23,645
Get the stuff.

501
00:23:25,186 --> 00:23:27,416
Get in the limo, big butt.

502
00:23:33,694 --> 00:23:35,992
- That shit be awesome!
- Where we going?

503
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,622
Where can we drop
you young women?

504
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:40,600
Just take us down La Brea.
We'll take a bus.

505
00:23:40,634 --> 00:23:42,101
No. We goin' down to Frankie's.

506
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:43,728
- Frankie's?
- Yeah.

507
00:23:43,771 --> 00:23:45,102
We'll take you.

508
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:46,663
I don't want to go down
to no Frankie's.

509
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:47,696
What's Frankie's?

510
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:48,867
Are you trippin'?

511
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:51,207
Let's go, Macavoy.

512
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,581
I can't stand when people
wanna flex their authority.

513
00:23:55,616 --> 00:23:58,107
I can't believe him
tryin' to tell us to--

514
00:24:02,957 --> 00:24:04,686
I don't think you need
to feel badly...

515
00:24:04,725 --> 00:24:06,784
about going to the hotel
and getting some sleep.

516
00:24:06,827 --> 00:24:08,192
You've had a tough day.

517
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:11,289
Letterman
ain't no Arsenio Hall.

518
00:24:11,332 --> 00:24:14,358
I heard that Arsenio
was a two-minute brother.

519
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:15,527
You buggin'.

520
00:24:15,569 --> 00:24:18,367
I heard the head of Arsenio's
jimmy big as a apple.

521
00:24:18,405 --> 00:24:23,206
Why don't we take a look
at that new 30-second spot?

522
00:24:23,244 --> 00:24:24,370
My name's Jay Bulworth.

523
00:24:24,411 --> 00:24:27,608
You don't know nothin'
about Arsenio's jimmy.

524
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,309
I got the 411
from Sanequa James.

525
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,716
- She saw it up close.
- You mean his dick?

526
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:35,916
I really like it
when you serve the potato salad.

527
00:24:35,956 --> 00:24:37,116
It's very dynamic.

528
00:24:37,157 --> 00:24:40,149
She gave him the nappy dugout.

529
00:24:40,194 --> 00:24:41,320
Nappy dugout?

530
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:43,455
Man got a nine-inch jimmy.

531
00:24:43,497 --> 00:24:45,556
But she booty ugly!

532
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:46,930
Dugout, do some nappy tricks.

533
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:49,561
Nappy dugout.
Jimmy and the nappy dugout.

534
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:51,764
Nappy tricks.

535
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:53,466
- Some of the Frisbee tricks.
- Yeah.

536
00:24:53,507 --> 00:24:55,975
Our welfare system
is out of control.

537
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,978
Ladies,
we'll just be five minutes...

538
00:24:58,012 --> 00:25:00,776
because the senator is meeting
the cardinal in the morning.

539
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:02,782
If I have to meet
with the mackerel snappers...

540
00:25:02,816 --> 00:25:04,113
can't I just dump the sultan?

541
00:25:04,151 --> 00:25:07,587
Two seconds.
Let me make a security check.

542
00:25:09,189 --> 00:25:10,486
Bulworth!

543
00:25:10,524 --> 00:25:13,755
Oom boop sheh bam
oh coo-coo mop

544
00:25:13,794 --> 00:25:16,228
Can ya sing, Bulworth?

545
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:19,926
Rock until you can't be a ghost.
You got to sing.

546
00:25:19,967 --> 00:25:23,061
Be a spirit. That's how
these niggers got here.

547
00:25:23,103 --> 00:25:25,503
Ghosts got 'em
when they touched each other.

548
00:25:25,539 --> 00:25:27,336
Be a spirit!

549
00:25:27,374 --> 00:25:31,572
And the spirit will not descend
without song.

550
00:25:31,612 --> 00:25:34,240
You got to sing, fool.

551
00:25:34,281 --> 00:25:37,580
Don't be no ghost, Bulworth!

552
00:25:37,618 --> 00:25:39,984
Not him. No cameras.

553
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,647
That's a tough break.

554
00:25:41,689 --> 00:25:43,987
I thought
they'd let you follow us...

555
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:46,151
but the camera
must make them nervous.

556
00:25:46,193 --> 00:25:47,285
How disappointing.

557
00:25:47,328 --> 00:25:49,455
- He with you?
- He all right.

558
00:25:49,496 --> 00:25:51,327
Check your weapons.

559
00:25:51,365 --> 00:25:54,061
I don't think we have
any weapons.

560
00:25:59,773 --> 00:26:02,765
- Expecting trouble?
- No.

561
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,801
You can't do nothin'
in five years.

562
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:07,075
His family owns a pork shop
for five years.

563
00:26:07,114 --> 00:26:08,240
Go on. You're good.

564
00:26:08,282 --> 00:26:11,809
He ain't doin' it to honor
all the subspecies of life.

565
00:26:16,023 --> 00:26:17,456
Hey.

566
00:26:17,491 --> 00:26:19,652
Good to see you, my friend.
That's--

567
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:25,131
What you said
at the church--brave.

568
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:28,293
If you haven't
been able to talk to me...

569
00:26:28,335 --> 00:26:30,200
you can talk to me now.

570
00:26:30,237 --> 00:26:33,263
- Go stand by the door.
- Why?

571
00:26:33,307 --> 00:26:35,605
- Keep a look out.
- Nobody can get in.

572
00:26:35,643 --> 00:26:37,042
Good work. Sit down.

573
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:41,512
Tell these niggers what's up

574
00:26:41,548 --> 00:26:42,674
Come, come get it

575
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,106
Senator?

576
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,474
Sir, if you're having--
Excuse me.

577
00:27:10,511 --> 00:27:12,536
I need to talk to the Senator.

578
00:27:12,579 --> 00:27:17,016
If you're having a problem,
we should talk about it.

579
00:27:17,051 --> 00:27:19,417
What are you concerned about?

580
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:23,389
I'm concerned that you told
300 people in a black church...

581
00:27:23,424 --> 00:27:25,892
they wouldn't be a factor...

582
00:27:25,926 --> 00:27:28,224
as long as we're controlled
by insurance.

583
00:27:28,262 --> 00:27:31,356
I'm concerned you went to
a Beverly Hills fund-raiser...

584
00:27:31,398 --> 00:27:34,799
and told people in entertainment
their product is lousy.

585
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:36,632
And, since many of them
are Jewish...

586
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:40,766
you thought it prudent
to mock their Jewish paranoia.

587
00:27:40,808 --> 00:27:43,936
I'm concerned we're in a club
in Compton...

588
00:27:43,977 --> 00:27:46,537
before the most important
campaign swing.

589
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:49,777
God knows what illegal activity
is taking place...

590
00:27:49,817 --> 00:27:51,148
and you're smoking marijuana!

591
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:53,915
I work for you.
You call the shots...

592
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:57,822
but I can do my job much better
if you just tell me--

593
00:27:57,858 --> 00:28:01,487
what is this new strategy?

594
00:28:01,528 --> 00:28:03,621
Have a drink, Murphy.
Live your life.

595
00:28:05,065 --> 00:28:06,293
Bartender.

596
00:28:06,333 --> 00:28:10,633
What the hell are you
doin' here, sugar? Chillin'?

597
00:28:10,671 --> 00:28:13,071
God damn!
Leroy, get over here!

598
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,439
Have a drink on me, sweetness.

599
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:19,344
Leroy, look who's here--
Clint Eastwood! Damn!

600
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:22,473
- That ain't Clint Eastwood.
- What do you mean?

601
00:28:22,516 --> 00:28:23,915
That's George Hamilton.

602
00:28:23,951 --> 00:28:25,145
George Hamilton?

603
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:27,449
He got that TV show.

604
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:30,651
Hey, George, what's happenin'?
What's up, man?

605
00:28:30,691 --> 00:28:32,283
God damn!

606
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:35,727
- He with you?
- Yeah.

607
00:28:35,763 --> 00:28:37,924
What's happenin'?

608
00:28:46,673 --> 00:28:50,679
I don't care who you
think you know. You can't enter.

609
00:29:04,226 --> 00:29:06,524
What you doin'?

610
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:11,232
Senator, this is fun,
but I'm gonna tell Mac...

611
00:29:11,266 --> 00:29:13,291
to get ready to go.

612
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,303
Put it away.

613
00:29:15,337 --> 00:29:17,168
What's up?

614
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:22,710
Hi.

615
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:24,735
You lost, massa?

616
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,509
How you doin'?

617
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,073
This place
ain't for you, motherfucker.

618
00:29:29,117 --> 00:29:31,051
Can we talk?

619
00:29:31,086 --> 00:29:33,646
This place
is for our homies, real niggers.

620
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,680
- He ain't no nigger.
- I ain't no what?

621
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,056
You ain't no real nigger.

622
00:29:38,093 --> 00:29:39,526
Is you a real nigger?

623
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:40,960
You callin' me nigger,
motherfucker?

624
00:29:40,996 --> 00:29:43,260
Don't call me nigger,
motherfucker.

625
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:46,131
Would you prefer
"motherfucker," motherfucker?

626
00:29:46,168 --> 00:29:49,695
What the fuck?
You can't call me motherfucker.

627
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:52,002
Shit!

628
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,803
You gotta get out of here!

629
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:55,810
I don't need my sister
coverin' my ass!

630
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:56,970
Yes, you do!

631
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:58,639
- Move.
- Where you goin'?

632
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:01,376
Get in your car and go!

633
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:05,782
I saw you rush your brother out.

634
00:30:05,821 --> 00:30:08,221
That's fucked up.
He owes me money.

635
00:30:08,256 --> 00:30:10,816
If I left him there,
you'd cap his ass.

636
00:30:10,859 --> 00:30:15,023
Motherfucker rip off L.D.,
he a dead-ass motherfucker.

637
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,793
I give people protection
around here. Right?

638
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:18,993
Mm-hmm.

639
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:21,764
I can give you
protection or pain.

640
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:23,668
It's wrong to embarrass me,
Nina...

641
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:27,197
wrong and detrimental
to my way of life.

642
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,369
That motherfucker owe me money.

643
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,407
I'm workin' on gettin' it.

644
00:30:34,349 --> 00:30:36,146
I'm tired of playing with you.

645
00:30:36,184 --> 00:30:38,618
Whenever I see you,
you say that.

646
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:40,314
I said I'm gonna get it.

647
00:30:40,355 --> 00:30:43,290
The only reason his legs
ain't snapped by now...

648
00:30:43,325 --> 00:30:45,020
is 'cause he's your brother.

649
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,550
If you fall absolute

650
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:50,224
I thought ya knew,
I thought ya knew

651
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,789
Bitches are hustlers, too

652
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,095
I thought ya knew

653
00:30:53,135 --> 00:30:55,933
Now, what I really want to know

654
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:58,531
Is where did little Nina go?

655
00:30:58,573 --> 00:31:01,235
I'm lookin' here,
I'm lookin' there

656
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,471
But I can't find her anywhere

657
00:31:03,512 --> 00:31:05,446
Where, oh, where

658
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,708
Is little Nina?

659
00:31:06,748 --> 00:31:07,942
I'm happy with Nina

660
00:31:07,983 --> 00:31:09,109
Hello, Nina

661
00:31:09,151 --> 00:31:10,618
Where you been-a

662
00:31:10,652 --> 00:31:11,949
Nina, Nina

663
00:31:11,987 --> 00:31:13,386
Nina

664
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:14,650
Has anybody seen 'er?

665
00:31:14,689 --> 00:31:16,987
Nina, Nina where you been-a?

666
00:31:17,025 --> 00:31:18,219
You're the prettiest girl

667
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,591
Leave.

668
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:20,890
OK, OK

669
00:31:20,929 --> 00:31:23,363
You come downstairs,
and then we'll play

670
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,499
Excuse me.
Coming through. Sorry.

671
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,565
Damn, motherfucker,
watch yourself!

672
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:34,734
I am terribly--

673
00:31:34,776 --> 00:31:36,437
You's a sorry-assed
motherfucker.

674
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,945
I'm terribly sorry, ma'am.

675
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,310
Keep walkin', bitch.

676
00:31:39,347 --> 00:31:41,315
I'll whoop your ass up,
motherfucker!

677
00:31:41,349 --> 00:31:44,409
I'll give you five dollars
to buy a new suit, punk!

678
00:31:44,453 --> 00:31:47,251
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

679
00:31:47,289 --> 00:31:49,814
- He won't leave.
- He's not tired?

680
00:31:49,858 --> 00:31:52,326
I doubt he's slept
the past five days.

681
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,260
- There's something else.
- What?

682
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,888
He's rhyming now.

683
00:31:55,931 --> 00:31:57,899
- Rhyming?
- Rhyming.

684
00:31:57,933 --> 00:31:59,764
He's talking in rhymes.

685
00:31:59,801 --> 00:32:02,599
It's very, very disconcerting.

686
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,197
Yo, Nina, Nina, I'm over here

687
00:32:06,241 --> 00:32:08,641
And this is really good
if you give it a chance

688
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:11,544
I never even knew
that I could dance

689
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,276
I guess some people can
and some people can't

690
00:32:14,316 --> 00:32:16,807
But I don't even care
if I splits my pants

691
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:20,515
We had a neighbor
who'd lose her mind sometimes.

692
00:32:20,555 --> 00:32:23,615
What's weird is,
when she got that way...

693
00:32:23,658 --> 00:32:25,683
she'd only speak in song lyrics.

694
00:32:25,727 --> 00:32:27,422
Murphy, Feldman,
you're lookin' pretty beat

695
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:29,794
I thought you might feel better
with some ribs to eat

696
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,299
Eat 'em, gentlemen,
you'll think they're really fine

697
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:34,928
And if you want a couple more,
you can get 'em anytime

698
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:36,938
I'm incredibly frightened.

699
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,992
Hey-oh

700
00:33:06,034 --> 00:33:08,229
Hey, hey, hey-oh

701
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,397
Hey-oh,
hey, hey, hey-oh

702
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:12,872
Hey, you sing, hey-oh

703
00:33:12,908 --> 00:33:14,603
Hey, hey, hey-oh

704
00:33:14,643 --> 00:33:16,304
Hey-oh

705
00:33:16,344 --> 00:33:17,641
Hey, hey, hey-oh

706
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,546
Let's go, come on,
just bounce to the beat, yeah

707
00:33:20,582 --> 00:33:21,708
Just bounce to the beat

708
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,378
Just bounce to the beat, yeah

709
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:27,513
That George Hamilton
sure can move.

710
00:33:27,556 --> 00:33:28,989
Just bounce to the beat, yeah

711
00:33:29,024 --> 00:33:31,015
Just bounce to the beat, yeah

712
00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:32,617
I once knew a girl
named Peggy Sue

713
00:33:32,661 --> 00:33:34,219
The only thing
that she liked to do

714
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,287
Was take the club,
get on the funk

715
00:33:36,331 --> 00:33:37,798
All I did was jump and go

716
00:33:57,852 --> 00:33:59,820
Hey, Lou,
look at that girl right there

717
00:33:59,854 --> 00:34:01,321
The one with the weave
all in her hair

718
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:02,755
Just bounce to the beat,
yeah, yeah

719
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,816
Just bounce to the beat,
come on, come on

720
00:34:04,859 --> 00:34:06,827
Tell that girl in the blue

721
00:34:06,861 --> 00:34:08,226
What she got to do
to get with you

722
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:10,561
Come on, just,
just bounce to the beat, yeah

723
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,861
Just bounce to the--

724
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,231
Tell that girl in the big ol'...

725
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:21,667
Talkin' 'bout the firm

726
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,940
That is, that is,
that is, that is

727
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,207
My pops used to warn me

728
00:34:25,247 --> 00:34:26,908
Never fall victim to the pornie

729
00:34:26,948 --> 00:34:28,108
Keep the pussy tight

730
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,277
The--the--the pussy,
the pussy tight

731
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,650
The pussy--the pussy tight

732
00:34:32,687 --> 00:34:33,847
That bitch

733
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:35,651
If I'm gonna fuck,
raise that dick

734
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:37,180
I whip my dick out-- whu-whu--

735
00:34:37,225 --> 00:34:40,023
When I whip out my dick,
I do my duty

736
00:34:48,536 --> 00:34:50,595
Hey, guys!

737
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,971
The dick,
his dick, his dick

738
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:55,670
Plays that dick, that d-dick

739
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,803
I need some pussy

740
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,143
Some dick, dick

741
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:02,513
Senator Bulworth, sir?
The fund-raiser!

742
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,383
Some pussy, his dick,
some pussy, his dick

743
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:09,481
The Beverly Wilshire
fund-raiser starts in 5 minutes!

744
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,220
Senator, the brunch
begins in five minutes.

745
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,251
But are you up to speaking?

746
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:16,287
Up? What's up?

747
00:35:16,331 --> 00:35:19,061
Perhaps Barbara Boxer
should talk.

748
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,763
It'll be fine.
Give me the speech.

749
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:25,272
Hey, Murphy, we had a good time.

750
00:35:25,307 --> 00:35:27,502
You're very tired, sir.

751
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,100
Just give me the speech.

752
00:35:29,144 --> 00:35:32,944
You girls want breakfast
at the Beverly Wilshire?

753
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:34,141
Where's Nina?

754
00:35:34,182 --> 00:35:37,777
We could drop you at
that chicken and waffles place.

755
00:35:37,819 --> 00:35:39,616
It's really yummy.
Have you ever tried it?

756
00:35:39,654 --> 00:35:40,780
Where's Nina?

757
00:35:40,822 --> 00:35:42,585
Nina said
she'd see you later, George.

758
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:45,787
- I'm comin'.
- Oh. OK.

759
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:49,319
I think it'll be fine.
He got it out of his system.

760
00:35:49,364 --> 00:35:51,798
Don't worry.
I'll be fine this time.

761
00:35:51,833 --> 00:35:57,032
You can get some sleep
at the hotel afterwards.

762
00:35:57,072 --> 00:35:58,334
It's gonna be fine.

763
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:01,399
And freshen up.

764
00:36:01,532 --> 00:36:03,557
OK, Macavoy.
Beverly Wilshire, chop chop.

765
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,899
You got nothin'
to worry about.

766
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:22,279
I'm tellin' you,
the man is a rock.

767
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,551
He looked in my eyes and said,
"This bill is un-American."

768
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,784
This man is granite.

769
00:36:26,824 --> 00:36:29,725
Good. We're down 3 1/8, and
the bill's still in committee.

770
00:36:29,761 --> 00:36:33,492
It never will get out.
Jay Bulworth's on this baby.

771
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:53,280
I'm sure all he needed
was a good meal and some sleep.

772
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:18,970
Senator?

773
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,944
Your speech, sir.

774
00:37:20,978 --> 00:37:23,105
Go get 'em.

775
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:26,013
Hiya, Constance.

776
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,417
Good of you to show up.
Rough night at the prom?

777
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:31,820
We're back on track.

778
00:37:31,856 --> 00:37:34,222
- How's Edward?
- Edgar.

779
00:37:34,258 --> 00:37:37,716
I like Edgar.
I've always liked Edgar.

780
00:37:37,762 --> 00:37:39,354
Knock it off.

781
00:37:39,397 --> 00:37:42,525
Once in a generation,
if we're lucky...

782
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,501
an individual
whose life and work...

783
00:37:44,535 --> 00:37:47,197
are the life and work
of the people he represents.

784
00:37:47,238 --> 00:37:50,230
Such is the man
who has served the people...

785
00:37:50,274 --> 00:37:51,673
of the state of California...

786
00:37:51,709 --> 00:37:55,907
Senator Jay Billington Bulworth!

787
00:38:06,724 --> 00:38:09,591
Thank you, Bill Stone.

788
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:16,833
We stand on the doorstep
of a new millennium.

789
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:20,360
We have an obligation...

790
00:38:20,404 --> 00:38:22,599
on one hand, to reduce...

791
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,505
Ahh...

792
00:38:24,542 --> 00:38:26,942
Yada yada...

793
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:28,411
Yada yada yada.

794
00:38:28,446 --> 00:38:30,175
It's up to the people
to decide...

795
00:38:30,214 --> 00:38:34,173
what the state of California
and the nation will do.

796
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:37,210
Biddy biddy bid--
Ooh, what'll we do?

797
00:38:37,255 --> 00:38:39,382
The nation will do

798
00:38:43,461 --> 00:38:45,986
It's up to you. What'll we do?

799
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,430
What'll we do,
well, it's up to you

800
00:38:48,466 --> 00:38:50,900
You know, it ain't that funny,
you contribute all my money

801
00:38:50,935 --> 00:38:53,802
You make your contribution,
then you get your solution

802
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:56,136
As long as you can pay,
I'm gonna do it all your way

803
00:38:56,174 --> 00:38:58,904
Yes, money talks,
and the people walk

804
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:04,245
Yeah, now let me hear ya say it,
big money

805
00:39:04,282 --> 00:39:07,479
Whoa! Big money, big money

806
00:39:07,518 --> 00:39:11,147
Big money, big money, big money

807
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:15,319
Big money, big money, big money

808
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,021
One man, one vote,
now is that really real?

809
00:39:18,062 --> 00:39:20,553
The name of our game
is "Let's Make a Deal"

810
00:39:20,598 --> 00:39:23,089
Now people got the problems,
the haves and the have-nots

811
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:25,534
But the ones that make me listen
pay for 30-second spots

812
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:30,564
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

813
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:32,940
Yo, Bank of America
at this table over here

814
00:39:32,977 --> 00:39:35,707
Wells Fargo and Citibank,
you're really very dear

815
00:39:35,746 --> 00:39:38,340
Loan billions to Mexico
and never have to fear

816
00:39:38,382 --> 00:39:40,782
'Cause taxpayers,
taxpayers take it in the rear

817
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:44,754
Take it
in the rear, take it in the rear

818
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:48,520
Yo, over here
we've got our friends from oil

819
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:50,789
They don't give a shit
how much wilderness is spoiled

820
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:52,125
They tell us
that they're careful

821
00:39:52,163 --> 00:39:53,357
We know that it's a lie

822
00:39:53,397 --> 00:39:55,922
As long as we keep drivin' cars,
they let the planet die

823
00:39:55,967 --> 00:39:58,367
Let the planet
die, let the planet die

824
00:39:58,402 --> 00:40:00,893
Exxon, Mobil,
the Saudis in Kuwait

825
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:03,463
If we still got the Middle-East,
the atmosphere can wait

826
00:40:03,507 --> 00:40:06,101
The Arabs got the oil,
we buy everything they sell

827
00:40:06,143 --> 00:40:07,337
But if the brothers
raise the price

828
00:40:07,378 --> 00:40:08,345
We blow 'em all to hell

829
00:40:08,379 --> 00:40:10,370
Boom boom boom boom

830
00:40:10,414 --> 00:40:11,540
Now let me hear ya say it

831
00:40:11,582 --> 00:40:13,072
- Saddam
- Saddam

832
00:40:13,117 --> 00:40:14,243
- Hussein
- Hussein

833
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:15,411
- Saddam
- Saddam

834
00:40:15,453 --> 00:40:16,647
- Hussein
- Hussein

835
00:40:16,687 --> 00:40:18,484
Mmm

836
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:21,753
Get me a phone number.
Dr. Morris Fishman, UCLA.

837
00:40:21,792 --> 00:40:23,555
He's at the Department
of Psychiatry.

838
00:40:23,594 --> 00:40:25,186
Get the number now.

839
00:40:25,229 --> 00:40:27,459
Yo, everybody
gonna get sick someday

840
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:30,058
But nobody knows
how they're gonna pay

841
00:40:30,101 --> 00:40:32,729
Healthcare, managed care, HMOs

842
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,136
Ain't gonna work,
no, sir, not those

843
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:37,367
'Cause the thing that's the same
in every one of these

844
00:40:37,408 --> 00:40:39,808
Is these motherfuckers there,
the insurance companies

845
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:42,574
Yeah, yeah

846
00:40:42,613 --> 00:40:45,047
You can call it single-payer
or Canadian way

847
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:48,108
Only socialized medicine
will ever save the day

848
00:40:48,152 --> 00:40:50,620
Come on now,
let me hear that dirty word

849
00:40:50,655 --> 00:40:52,088
Socialism!

850
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:54,523
Yeah, yeah, yeah

851
00:40:54,558 --> 00:40:57,823
Now, the women in the world
is mistreated and abused

852
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,228
But when we try to fix it,
we tend to get confused

853
00:41:00,264 --> 00:41:01,492
I got respect
from all the sisters

854
00:41:01,532 --> 00:41:02,965
They will tell you
that's my style

855
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,331
But there's one thing
in politics

856
00:41:04,368 --> 00:41:05,392
That always makes me smile

857
00:41:05,436 --> 00:41:08,132
I like the pussy, the pussy,
I like it really fine

858
00:41:08,172 --> 00:41:10,663
And when you be a senator,
you get it all the time

859
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:13,199
The young ones, the old ones,
they really like 'em all

860
00:41:13,244 --> 00:41:15,644
And when you be in Washington,
you hardly have to call

861
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,977
The women, they love power

862
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:18,276
And if you don't
pull that rug out

863
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:20,944
No matter what they say or do,
they give you nappy dugout

864
00:41:20,985 --> 00:41:24,751
Now, would we be eligible
for an Emmy or a Peabody?

865
00:41:24,855 --> 00:41:27,756
Will rap be
a regular part of your campaign?

866
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,851
A part of my campaign?

867
00:41:29,894 --> 00:41:31,361
Now, that just sounds insane

868
00:41:31,395 --> 00:41:33,829
- Went well, don't you think?
- Extremely.

869
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:36,662
Is campaign finance
reform your central issue now?

870
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:38,328
It's the only way to go

871
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:41,770
If these guys pay the piper,
then the piper does a show

872
00:41:41,806 --> 00:41:44,366
You got that right.
Bye, fellas.

873
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,105
Wait in here.

874
00:41:50,147 --> 00:41:51,637
I'll be right back.

875
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,617
Patricia Ireland
is expected in town.

876
00:42:00,658 --> 00:42:01,886
Will you have a meeting
with her?

877
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:03,120
How does this approach sit...

878
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,185
with the National
Organization of Women?

879
00:42:05,229 --> 00:42:06,389
- Hi.
- Hi.

880
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:09,263
- That speech was phat.
- "Phat"?

881
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,860
- You got a room here?
- Huh?

882
00:42:11,902 --> 00:42:14,302
A room we can go to upstairs?

883
00:42:14,338 --> 00:42:16,602
- A room?
- A room.

884
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,574
What do you want to do now?

885
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:21,169
We could proceed to
the church, then the debate...

886
00:42:21,212 --> 00:42:23,772
or we can shut down
until the debate.

887
00:42:23,814 --> 00:42:25,577
Dr. Morris Fishman
is in Paraguay.

888
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:27,811
- It's your call.
- My call?

889
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:30,582
It's my call?
I know it's my call!

890
00:42:30,621 --> 00:42:32,589
Feldman?

891
00:42:32,623 --> 00:42:35,023
Uh, Feldman?

892
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:38,688
Is Mrs. Bulworth
making the campaign swing today?

893
00:42:38,729 --> 00:42:40,128
Yes, sir?

894
00:42:41,632 --> 00:42:45,261
Uh, Feldman, could I
have the key to the room?

895
00:42:45,302 --> 00:42:48,100
- The room?
- The room, upstairs.

896
00:42:48,139 --> 00:42:50,004
Oh! Sure.

897
00:42:51,509 --> 00:42:53,272
- Feldman?
- Yeah?

898
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,404
- Key?
- Right. Sorry.

899
00:42:57,882 --> 00:42:59,850
You have no fear...

900
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:02,478
your big money sources
are gonna dry up?

901
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,748
What?

902
00:43:03,788 --> 00:43:06,120
- Senator Bulworth?
- It's in the car.

903
00:43:06,157 --> 00:43:08,318
The Senator needs his room key.

904
00:43:08,359 --> 00:43:11,795
Senator, we have
to get in the car now, sir.

905
00:43:11,829 --> 00:43:15,196
Key's in the car. Let's go.

906
00:43:15,232 --> 00:43:17,826
Why don't you
get some sleep now?

907
00:43:17,868 --> 00:43:20,098
Yes. Nina and I
are going up to the room.

908
00:43:20,137 --> 00:43:22,230
- That's not a good idea.
- Yes, it is.

909
00:43:22,273 --> 00:43:23,900
- You and her right now?
- Yes.

910
00:43:23,941 --> 00:43:25,533
I've got a better idea.

911
00:43:25,576 --> 00:43:29,774
You and I get in the limo alone
and circle back when you want.

912
00:43:29,814 --> 00:43:31,372
Why would I do that?

913
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:33,940
Will the insurance industry
respond well to your remarks?

914
00:43:36,654 --> 00:43:39,487
Senator,
where is the nappy dugout?

915
00:43:39,523 --> 00:43:40,990
Where's the nappy dugout?

916
00:43:41,025 --> 00:43:42,253
That's where you get the bug out

917
00:43:42,293 --> 00:43:44,488
How are you gonna keep
the American Medical...

918
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:46,086
Who are the girls?

919
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,392
The girls?

920
00:43:47,431 --> 00:43:49,023
They're friends of mine,
can't you see?

921
00:43:49,066 --> 00:43:52,058
Feldman, Feldman,
where's that key?

922
00:43:52,103 --> 00:43:54,503
The key's
in your hand. You got the life!

923
00:43:54,538 --> 00:43:57,666
You got the life,
ain't it grand?

924
00:43:57,708 --> 00:43:58,834
You got the life

925
00:43:58,876 --> 00:44:00,867
Senator, how do you intend...

926
00:44:08,252 --> 00:44:10,550
You got
to be a spirit, Bulworth.

927
00:44:10,588 --> 00:44:12,715
You can't be no ghost.

928
00:44:12,756 --> 00:44:15,486
You got it all, Bulworth.

929
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:16,823
Ain't life grand?

930
00:44:16,861 --> 00:44:18,954
Ain't it grand?

931
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:20,793
You got the life, man.

932
00:44:22,032 --> 00:44:26,298
Let's go, Macavoy.
We're on the move.

933
00:44:26,337 --> 00:44:28,464
Give me the phone.
I need Davers.

934
00:44:30,374 --> 00:44:33,173
You got to be a spirit,
not a ghost!

935
00:44:33,306 --> 00:44:35,035
Macavoy,
you know where Davers is?

936
00:44:35,075 --> 00:44:36,201
No, sir.

937
00:44:36,243 --> 00:44:38,370
Maybe he's at our next stop,
the church.

938
00:44:38,412 --> 00:44:40,812
You've had a crushing weekend--

939
00:44:40,847 --> 00:44:43,680
This is
Eddie Davers. Leave a message.

940
00:44:43,717 --> 00:44:45,514
You should get some sleep.

941
00:44:45,552 --> 00:44:47,349
Davers, this is the Senator.

942
00:44:47,387 --> 00:44:49,218
Once you get this message...

943
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:53,386
call the man you introduced me
to in Washington.

944
00:44:53,427 --> 00:44:56,954
Tell him he has to cancel
the weekend research project.

945
00:44:56,997 --> 00:45:00,091
It's very important.
See you at the church.

946
00:45:00,133 --> 00:45:01,464
The church in Pasadena.

947
00:45:01,501 --> 00:45:03,401
We can drop
the young supporters off.

948
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:05,337
Where can we take
you young ladies?

949
00:45:05,372 --> 00:45:06,498
We rollin' with y'all!

950
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,566
Senator, a pleasure to see you.

951
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:12,237
Cardinal! Yo!

952
00:45:12,279 --> 00:45:15,476
I hope Mrs. Bulworth
isn't under the weather.

953
00:45:15,515 --> 00:45:18,313
No. She's fine.
I'll be with you shortly.

954
00:45:18,351 --> 00:45:21,582
Y'all got a choir
in your church?

955
00:45:21,621 --> 00:45:23,418
I'm with the network.

956
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:24,856
Find Davers.

957
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:27,325
The weekend research project
has to be canceled.

958
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,193
The weekend research project
has to be canceled.

959
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:33,222
Macavoy, go in there
and find Davers.

960
00:45:33,266 --> 00:45:35,359
I've got to find Davers.

961
00:45:35,402 --> 00:45:37,893
Sir, a couple of questions.

962
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:19,611
The glory of his name

963
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:21,876
- You see him?
- No.

964
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,280
We are honored today
by the attendance...

965
00:46:23,316 --> 00:46:27,047
of United States Senator
Jay Billington Bulworth.

966
00:46:27,087 --> 00:46:29,248
Let us rejoice
in his presence...

967
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:33,521
and sing hymn number 376.

968
00:46:34,828 --> 00:46:36,989
Joyful, joyful

969
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,429
We adore thee

970
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,592
God of glory

971
00:46:40,634 --> 00:46:42,135
Lord of love

972
00:46:42,135 --> 00:46:43,602
Lord of love

973
00:46:43,637 --> 00:46:47,073
Hearts unfold like flowers
before thee

974
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:54,042
- Get out of the car.
- Why?

975
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:58,141
I got some problems,
and you're not safe with me.

976
00:46:58,184 --> 00:46:59,481
What does that mean?

977
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:01,077
Just get out of the car.

978
00:47:01,121 --> 00:47:03,453
- You afraid of somebody?
- Yeah.

979
00:47:05,191 --> 00:47:07,625
Kill 'em live

980
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:09,185
Kill 'em live

981
00:47:09,229 --> 00:47:11,493
Kill 'em live

982
00:47:11,531 --> 00:47:13,465
Kill 'em live

983
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,400
Kill 'em live

984
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:17,596
Kill 'em live

985
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:19,036
Kill 'em live

986
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,406
Thou our father

987
00:47:22,442 --> 00:47:24,740
Christ our brother

988
00:47:24,778 --> 00:47:29,306
All who live in love are thine

989
00:47:29,349 --> 00:47:33,979
Teach us how to love each other

990
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:41,426
Lift us to the joy divine

991
00:47:43,129 --> 00:47:46,292
If you're so afraid,
why don't you tell me why?

992
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,961
I can't.
I just need a guy to call a guy.

993
00:47:49,002 --> 00:47:50,196
Call the guy yourself.

994
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:53,331
I don't know how.

995
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,103
Let's go back to the hotel.

996
00:47:56,142 --> 00:47:59,134
- You liked that hotel.
- I gotta stay out of sight.

997
00:48:01,247 --> 00:48:03,044
Kill 'em live

998
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:05,210
Kill 'em live

999
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,082
Kill 'em live

1000
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,213
It is worse than arrogance.
It is contempt.

1001
00:48:09,255 --> 00:48:14,283
Contempt for the press
and for the people.

1002
00:48:14,327 --> 00:48:18,195
Have you heard a rumor that
Gephardt's looking for someone?

1003
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:28,899
I'm staying out of sight
until he gets back.

1004
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:30,432
We can wait in the car.

1005
00:48:30,477 --> 00:48:34,174
Hi, Mimi.
We lost our ride to the debate.

1006
00:48:34,214 --> 00:48:37,581
Can we catch a ride
with you guys?

1007
00:48:37,617 --> 00:48:40,202
- He split with the limo?
- Yeah.

1008
00:48:40,335 --> 00:48:42,963
So who walks in? Huey Newton.

1009
00:48:43,005 --> 00:48:46,441
You know who Huey Newton was?

1010
00:48:48,444 --> 00:48:52,141
A lot of people I talk to--
black, your age--don't know.

1011
00:48:56,118 --> 00:48:57,779
Huey.

1012
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:03,217
Why do you think
there are no more black leaders?

1013
00:49:07,663 --> 00:49:10,689
Some think it's because
they all got killed...

1014
00:49:10,733 --> 00:49:12,894
but I think
it's from the decimation...

1015
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:14,869
of urban manufacturing bases.

1016
00:49:14,903 --> 00:49:18,737
Senator, an optimistic,
energized population...

1017
00:49:18,774 --> 00:49:20,264
throws up optimistic,
energized leaders.

1018
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:23,039
When you shift manufacturing
to the Third World...

1019
00:49:23,078 --> 00:49:25,342
you destroy
the blue-collar core...

1020
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:27,712
of the black activist
population.

1021
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,844
Some people would say
the problem is cultural.

1022
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:33,855
But the media is controlled
by fewer and fewer people.

1023
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:38,223
Add to that a consumer culture
based on self-gratification...

1024
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:40,455
and it means nobody
wants leaders...

1025
00:49:40,496 --> 00:49:41,963
calling for self-sacrifice.

1026
00:49:41,997 --> 00:49:44,898
Fact is, I'm a materialist.

1027
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,400
If I look at the economy...

1028
00:49:46,435 --> 00:49:49,404
high employment means
jobs for African-Americans.

1029
00:49:49,438 --> 00:49:51,702
World War II meant
lots of jobs for black folks.

1030
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:56,404
That's what energized people
for the civil rights movement.

1031
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:58,379
An energized,
hopeful community...

1032
00:49:58,413 --> 00:50:03,077
not only produces leaders,
but leaders they'll respond to.

1033
00:50:03,118 --> 00:50:04,881
What do you think, Senator?

1034
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:12,921
What do you think my age is?

1035
00:50:12,961 --> 00:50:14,087
Your age?

1036
00:50:14,129 --> 00:50:16,256
You said black people my age.

1037
00:50:16,298 --> 00:50:18,926
Oh. 23?

1038
00:50:18,967 --> 00:50:21,026
Twenty-six.

1039
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:25,598
How old do you think I am?

1040
00:50:27,075 --> 00:50:29,407
How old?

1041
00:50:29,444 --> 00:50:30,741
Hmm?

1042
00:50:30,779 --> 00:50:32,474
Sixty.

1043
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:35,779
My mother was a Panther.

1044
00:50:35,818 --> 00:50:38,150
Huey Newton
fed kids on my block.

1045
00:50:38,187 --> 00:50:39,313
Huh.

1046
00:50:39,354 --> 00:50:42,517
Senator,
aren't you late for the debate?

1047
00:50:42,558 --> 00:50:45,288
Davers, Davers, Davers.

1048
00:50:45,327 --> 00:50:47,659
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

1049
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:48,754
I'm here.

1050
00:50:48,797 --> 00:50:52,631
We have to call Vinnie.

1051
00:50:52,668 --> 00:50:56,434
You know what I get
out of this place? Bupkus.

1052
00:50:58,073 --> 00:50:59,870
Talk to you later.

1053
00:51:01,810 --> 00:51:04,005
- Yeah?
- Vinnie, it's Nina.

1054
00:51:04,046 --> 00:51:05,274
You a fucking bimbo?

1055
00:51:05,314 --> 00:51:07,839
I couldn't get him
up to the room.

1056
00:51:07,883 --> 00:51:09,009
You're incompetent.

1057
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:11,212
You didn't
have to push him off.

1058
00:51:11,253 --> 00:51:13,915
You just had
to get him upstairs.

1059
00:51:13,956 --> 00:51:15,184
I've had it with you!

1060
00:51:15,224 --> 00:51:16,691
Vinnie, wait.

1061
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,558
You move on to plan B.

1062
00:51:19,595 --> 00:51:21,995
What the fuck is plan B?

1063
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:25,522
You know plan B.
And you better get it done.

1064
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:30,402
You said if I got him up
to the room, I'd get 10 Gs.

1065
00:51:31,974 --> 00:51:34,465
- Fucking bimbo!
- Vinnie.

1066
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,879
Vinnie! Davers.

1067
00:51:40,916 --> 00:51:43,476
The Senator
wants to speak with you.

1068
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:47,010
Hey, Vinnie. Vinnie, my friend,
how are you?

1069
00:51:47,055 --> 00:51:50,582
Vinnie, I'm very relieved
to get in touch with you...

1070
00:51:50,626 --> 00:51:53,686
because we're gonna have
to call off...

1071
00:51:53,729 --> 00:51:55,060
the weekend research project.

1072
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:56,257
Call it off?

1073
00:51:56,298 --> 00:51:58,630
- That's not a problem, is it?
- Not a problem?

1074
00:51:58,667 --> 00:52:01,966
My plans have changed.

1075
00:52:02,004 --> 00:52:04,404
But you keep the fee.
That's not a problem, is it?

1076
00:52:04,439 --> 00:52:05,906
No.

1077
00:52:05,941 --> 00:52:08,102
Oh, good!

1078
00:52:08,143 --> 00:52:10,168
Good, good, Vinnie.

1079
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:14,548
Let me ask you a favor.

1080
00:52:14,583 --> 00:52:18,019
Can we keep this
just between the two of us?

1081
00:52:18,053 --> 00:52:22,114
You and me
and whoever's doing the thing?

1082
00:52:22,157 --> 00:52:25,092
We're gonna need a surcharge.

1083
00:52:25,127 --> 00:52:27,322
- Fine.
- Cancellation fee.

1084
00:52:27,362 --> 00:52:29,853
OK. Just keep the check.

1085
00:52:29,898 --> 00:52:32,093
No. An additional 50,000.

1086
00:52:32,134 --> 00:52:34,568
That's good.

1087
00:52:34,603 --> 00:52:38,630
I'll send Davers over right away
with another check.

1088
00:52:38,674 --> 00:52:40,039
Shall we consider it done?

1089
00:52:40,075 --> 00:52:41,565
Yeah.

1090
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:45,205
Wonderful. Wonderful.

1091
00:52:45,247 --> 00:52:48,273
Good. Thanks, Vinnie, thanks.

1092
00:52:48,317 --> 00:52:50,649
You're welcome.

1093
00:52:50,686 --> 00:52:52,551
Fuckin' crazy motherfucker.

1094
00:52:54,122 --> 00:52:58,024
Senator, what is
a weekend research project?

1095
00:52:58,060 --> 00:53:01,791
No, it's a-- It's nothing.

1096
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,802
It's all off.

1097
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:06,870
That guy's nuts.

1098
00:53:13,211 --> 00:53:14,371
I don't feel too good.

1099
00:53:14,413 --> 00:53:15,903
Want something?

1100
00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:25,920
Vinnie.

1101
00:53:25,957 --> 00:53:27,481
You want something?

1102
00:53:30,462 --> 00:53:31,588
Vinnie!

1103
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:33,962
I gotta go. I'm out.

1104
00:53:33,999 --> 00:53:35,125
All right!

1105
00:53:35,167 --> 00:53:36,930
All right!

1106
00:53:36,968 --> 00:53:39,061
We're late,
we're late, we're late!

1107
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:40,901
For a very important debate!

1108
00:53:40,939 --> 00:53:43,999
And I'm feeling so great
while I'm feeling my fate

1109
00:53:44,042 --> 00:53:45,339
when I get to the gate--

1110
00:53:45,377 --> 00:53:46,674
Senator!

1111
00:53:46,711 --> 00:53:49,179
'Cause I got a new slate
on my plate and it's great

1112
00:53:54,853 --> 00:53:57,447
If you want to hide,
I know a place.

1113
00:53:57,489 --> 00:53:59,753
You think after all this crap
is over Tuesday...

1114
00:53:59,791 --> 00:54:02,783
that maybe you could
actually, like, hang?

1115
00:54:02,828 --> 00:54:05,956
- Hang?
- Hang out with me?

1116
00:54:05,997 --> 00:54:07,430
Oh, hang out with you.

1117
00:54:07,466 --> 00:54:08,956
What do you think?

1118
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,092
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1119
00:54:10,135 --> 00:54:12,501
I got the plan.
Want to meet my family tonight?

1120
00:54:12,537 --> 00:54:16,439
Oh, that would--That's great.

1121
00:54:16,475 --> 00:54:18,272
That's great, that's great

1122
00:54:18,310 --> 00:54:19,777
I got a whole new slate

1123
00:54:19,811 --> 00:54:22,405
I get to meet the family,
I can hardly wait

1124
00:54:22,514 --> 00:54:25,950
I think he's finally
recognizing the situation...

1125
00:54:25,984 --> 00:54:27,417
and getting some sleep.

1126
00:54:27,452 --> 00:54:28,646
There's...

1127
00:54:30,288 --> 00:54:32,051
OK, listen to me.

1128
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,615
I'm not letting him
on television...

1129
00:54:34,659 --> 00:54:37,184
until he explains himself.

1130
00:54:37,229 --> 00:54:40,096
Say he got a disease
or stuck in traffic.

1131
00:54:40,132 --> 00:54:42,191
We'll stand here
and block him...

1132
00:54:42,234 --> 00:54:44,395
arms akimbo if necessary.

1133
00:54:44,436 --> 00:54:48,167
Prevent him from doing further
damage to his and our careers.

1134
00:54:48,206 --> 00:54:51,767
I'm explicitly authorizing
the use of force at this point.

1135
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:53,971
Murphy, Feldman, Macavoy.

1136
00:54:54,012 --> 00:54:55,843
Hey, boss.

1137
00:54:55,881 --> 00:54:57,280
Didn't work.

1138
00:54:57,315 --> 00:54:59,715
I think he's OK now.
Got the electric razor?

1139
00:54:59,751 --> 00:55:01,844
- I got the razor.
- Get him to shave.

1140
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,287
They're ready.
How about a quick shave?

1141
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:08,459
The format agreed to
is as follows--

1142
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:10,188
there will be
no opening statements.

1143
00:55:10,228 --> 00:55:12,355
Questions will be addressed
to each of the candidates...

1144
00:55:12,397 --> 00:55:13,830
in alternating order.

1145
00:55:13,865 --> 00:55:15,162
The candidate to whom
the question is addressed...

1146
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:17,668
will have two and a half minutes
to answer.

1147
00:55:17,702 --> 00:55:20,136
The other candidate will then
have one minute to reply.

1148
00:55:20,172 --> 00:55:22,732
And the first candidate will
then have another 30 seconds...

1149
00:55:22,774 --> 00:55:24,833
for a final comment
on that question.

1150
00:55:24,876 --> 00:55:26,138
After the allotted time
for questions...

1151
00:55:26,178 --> 00:55:27,736
each candidate
will make a final statement...

1152
00:55:27,779 --> 00:55:29,303
of three minutes.

1153
00:55:29,347 --> 00:55:31,042
Mr. Weldie
won the drawing of lots.

1154
00:55:31,082 --> 00:55:32,481
He's elected to make
his closing statement.

1155
00:55:32,517 --> 00:55:35,680
I was supposed
to set him up, not do the shit.

1156
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,314
Now I can't even get Vinnie
on the damn phone.

1157
00:55:38,356 --> 00:55:41,257
The first question
will be from Jann Carl...

1158
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:42,555
and is for Senator Bulworth.

1159
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:44,824
Senator, the news today
requires us to ask you...

1160
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:47,354
about this sudden change
in your campaign style.

1161
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:48,593
Could you explain it?

1162
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:49,759
Why are you here?

1163
00:55:49,801 --> 00:55:52,326
Admit it.
It's 'cause you make a bundle.

1164
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:55,498
I beg your pardon?

1165
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:58,168
You're not here 'cause you're
getting paid a bundle of money.

1166
00:55:58,210 --> 00:55:59,700
Come on, come on.

1167
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:01,268
We got three
pretty rich guys here...

1168
00:56:01,313 --> 00:56:05,181
getting paid
by some really rich guys...

1169
00:56:05,217 --> 00:56:07,947
to ask a couple
of other rich guys...

1170
00:56:07,986 --> 00:56:10,511
questions about their campaign.

1171
00:56:10,555 --> 00:56:13,820
But our campaigns are financed
by the same guys...

1172
00:56:13,858 --> 00:56:15,553
that pay you guys your money...

1173
00:56:15,594 --> 00:56:17,585
so what are we talking about?

1174
00:56:17,629 --> 00:56:19,187
I'm bringing the man
down there.

1175
00:56:19,231 --> 00:56:21,222
If they don't like it,
they can kiss my ass.

1176
00:56:21,266 --> 00:56:22,426
I could tell you stories...

1177
00:56:22,467 --> 00:56:24,958
about getting money from them
that would pin your ears back.

1178
00:56:25,003 --> 00:56:27,096
Stories about me.

1179
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:29,231
I don't know about Hugh.

1180
00:56:29,274 --> 00:56:31,299
Do you have that, uh...

1181
00:56:31,343 --> 00:56:32,935
Well...

1182
00:56:32,978 --> 00:56:35,242
But, uh, I tell you--

1183
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,975
He's got something hot here.

1184
00:56:37,015 --> 00:56:38,448
Republicans, Democrats,
what's the difference?

1185
00:56:38,483 --> 00:56:42,283
Your guys, my guys,
our guys, us guys.

1186
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:43,446
It's a club...

1187
00:56:43,488 --> 00:56:48,016
so why don't we just,
uh, have a drink? Hugh?

1188
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,422
No?

1189
00:56:50,462 --> 00:56:52,794
You know, Hugh,
if you win this thing...

1190
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:55,766
you really gotta think about
where your kids go to school.

1191
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,701
We put our daughter in
Sidwell-Friends with Clinton's.

1192
00:56:58,737 --> 00:57:00,227
The Gores really like
St. Albans...

1193
00:57:00,272 --> 00:57:01,830
but a public school
anywhere around Washington...

1194
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:03,340
is a disaster.

1195
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,071
Excuse me, Senator.
If you don't mind...

1196
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:08,602
I think we're here to ask
about the news of your camp--

1197
00:57:08,647 --> 00:57:10,979
News?

1198
00:57:11,016 --> 00:57:12,813
What are you talking about,
the news?

1199
00:57:12,851 --> 00:57:14,443
Come on, the guys you and I
get our money from...

1200
00:57:14,486 --> 00:57:15,885
they don't want the people
to have the news.

1201
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:17,387
They want you to think
that corporations...

1202
00:57:17,422 --> 00:57:18,650
are more efficient
than government, right?

1203
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,419
You want to know
why the health care industry...

1204
00:57:20,458 --> 00:57:22,153
is the most profitable business
in the Unites States?

1205
00:57:22,193 --> 00:57:24,491
'Cause the insurance companies
take 24 cents...

1206
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:26,019
out of every dollar
that's spent.

1207
00:57:26,064 --> 00:57:27,156
You know what
it takes the government...

1208
00:57:27,198 --> 00:57:28,688
to do the same thing
for Medicare?

1209
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:31,201
Three cents out of every dollar.

1210
00:57:31,236 --> 00:57:32,794
Now, what is all this crap
they hand you...

1211
00:57:32,837 --> 00:57:34,805
about business
being more efficient?

1212
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:37,205
What the hell is going on here?

1213
00:57:37,242 --> 00:57:39,733
These guys need to be regulated.

1214
00:57:39,778 --> 00:57:42,542
You think these pigs
are gonna regulate themselves?

1215
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,706
What's going on?

1216
00:57:43,748 --> 00:57:45,306
If you'll please pardon
the interruption...

1217
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:47,511
it seems
as if we're experiencing...

1218
00:57:47,552 --> 00:57:49,144
some technical
difficulties here.

1219
00:57:49,187 --> 00:57:51,451
Hey, Hugh, what's up?

1220
00:57:51,489 --> 00:57:54,219
What's up?
What's happening, baby?

1221
00:57:57,062 --> 00:57:58,757
I'm doing what I got to do.

1222
00:57:58,797 --> 00:58:00,526
I'm bringing him down there,
God damn it.

1223
00:58:00,565 --> 00:58:02,032
Ladies and gentlemen,
please stand by.

1224
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,501
We are experiencing
technical difficulties.

1225
00:58:04,536 --> 00:58:07,664
What's going on?
Are we gonna do this or not?

1226
00:58:07,706 --> 00:58:09,674
We're doing the best we can.

1227
00:58:23,655 --> 00:58:24,986
Oh, hi, Davers.

1228
00:58:25,023 --> 00:58:26,923
Uh, power failure.

1229
00:58:32,397 --> 00:58:36,857
If he wants to crash and burn
his entire fucking career, fine.

1230
00:58:36,901 --> 00:58:39,131
Fuck him!

1231
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:43,334
But I'll be goddamned if that
asshole's taking us down, too.

1232
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:46,173
It's not like I've not been
completely loyal to that fucker.

1233
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:49,442
I've had other offers, you know.
I beat 'em off with a stick.

1234
00:58:51,116 --> 00:58:54,779
Didn't he have it all,
though, Bill?

1235
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:56,946
Looks, brains,
more or less enough...

1236
00:58:56,988 --> 00:58:58,182
classy wife...

1237
00:58:58,223 --> 00:59:01,522
but Jesus Christ, Bill--
for God's sake, he had us.

1238
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:03,584
The motherfucker had us.

1239
00:59:05,163 --> 00:59:09,657
If he had just listened to me
on welfare reform in '88.

1240
00:59:09,701 --> 00:59:13,569
If he just chased
not quite so much pussy.

1241
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:15,095
Could have gone all the way.

1242
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:16,801
But, hey, we still might.

1243
00:59:16,841 --> 00:59:19,742
2000's wide fucking open,
but now...

1244
00:59:19,778 --> 00:59:21,609
with this shit...

1245
00:59:21,646 --> 00:59:23,113
we're fucked in the ass, man.

1246
00:59:23,148 --> 00:59:25,378
Fucked in the ass
with our pants down.

1247
00:59:27,085 --> 00:59:28,211
Cocksucker.

1248
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:37,754
Fuck.

1249
00:59:42,834 --> 00:59:44,802
Hi, Larry.

1250
00:59:44,836 --> 00:59:48,067
Murphy, Murphy, Murphy.

1251
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:49,903
How the hell are you?

1252
00:59:49,941 --> 00:59:51,067
You ever seen anything
like this?

1253
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:54,476
Let's just say
it is very unusual stuff.

1254
00:59:54,512 --> 00:59:56,673
Well, I don't know what to say.

1255
00:59:56,714 --> 00:59:59,842
Let's face it. I'm gonna have
to do a show on this.

1256
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:02,944
Oh, my God, no, Larry.

1257
01:00:02,987 --> 01:00:05,285
Come on. Do you have to?

1258
01:00:05,323 --> 01:00:07,086
No. Sure you wanna handle it
like that?

1259
01:00:07,125 --> 01:00:09,150
You kidding?
The guy's on a roll.

1260
01:00:09,194 --> 01:00:10,991
They want someone like this.

1261
01:00:11,029 --> 01:00:13,463
People are sick and tired
of all this baloney.

1262
01:00:13,498 --> 01:00:14,760
I want him on my show.

1263
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:17,529
That's exactly what I told him.
Now he's finally listening.

1264
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:20,163
The man's got this giant vision.
We're finally getting it out.

1265
01:00:20,205 --> 01:00:22,070
I've been hammering away at him.

1266
01:00:22,106 --> 01:00:24,006
It's very gratifying
that he's listening to me.

1267
01:00:24,042 --> 01:00:27,637
It's very gratifying to me.
That's just between you and me.

1268
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:28,805
What are we talking about?

1269
01:00:28,847 --> 01:00:30,678
We've got Clinton tonight.

1270
01:00:30,715 --> 01:00:32,182
Bump him! Just kidding.

1271
01:00:32,217 --> 01:00:35,118
Um, how about tomorrow?

1272
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,916
- Book him.
- We'll call you.

1273
01:00:36,955 --> 01:00:38,081
Call him.

1274
01:00:38,122 --> 01:00:39,384
Nobody's seen this in years.

1275
01:00:39,424 --> 01:00:41,824
This is it.
Your boy is it.

1276
01:00:41,860 --> 01:00:43,885
He's it. It's kind of historic.

1277
01:00:43,928 --> 01:00:45,190
You've got insight.

1278
01:00:45,230 --> 01:00:47,562
No. You've got insight.
You're the guy that saw it.

1279
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:49,624
You're the one
that's been telling people.

1280
01:00:49,667 --> 01:00:51,828
Senator, Mr. Weldie,
I'm sorry to say...

1281
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:53,838
but we'll have to cancel this
for today.

1282
01:00:53,872 --> 01:00:55,635
They don't want to bump
Jerry Springer.

1283
01:00:55,673 --> 01:00:58,005
I'm sorry, folks.
That will be it.

1284
01:00:58,042 --> 01:01:00,033
Oh, fine, Senator, how are you?

1285
01:01:00,078 --> 01:01:02,569
You're not feeling
like you need a vacation?

1286
01:01:02,614 --> 01:01:03,740
Not really, no, no.

1287
01:01:03,781 --> 01:01:05,248
I gotta tell you,
I'm confused...

1288
01:01:05,283 --> 01:01:07,877
because you and I
could play ball.

1289
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:10,479
But you are playing
a much rougher brand of ball...

1290
01:01:10,522 --> 01:01:12,353
than I'm accustomed to.

1291
01:01:12,390 --> 01:01:14,017
I have your policy here.

1292
01:01:14,058 --> 01:01:16,424
Oh, the policy,
Crockett, thank you.

1293
01:01:16,461 --> 01:01:17,894
Forget it. I don't need it.

1294
01:01:17,929 --> 01:01:19,055
Everything OK?

1295
01:01:19,097 --> 01:01:21,224
OK is not the word
for it, Senator.

1296
01:01:21,266 --> 01:01:23,666
Hong Kong pork bellies
are way down...

1297
01:01:23,701 --> 01:01:25,032
and you're back in the chips.

1298
01:01:25,069 --> 01:01:27,663
Good. Did you give
the guy the check?

1299
01:01:27,705 --> 01:01:29,297
- Aw, poor guy.
- What?

1300
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:31,399
Well, he collapsed.

1301
01:01:31,442 --> 01:01:32,875
What? He collapsed?

1302
01:01:32,911 --> 01:01:34,276
Probably a heart attack.

1303
01:01:34,312 --> 01:01:37,770
When you have
a moment, we have to sit down.

1304
01:01:37,815 --> 01:01:39,407
Did he cancel the weekend
research project?

1305
01:01:39,450 --> 01:01:42,283
- I guess so, boss.
- You guess so?

1306
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,582
Well, I don't know.

1307
01:01:43,621 --> 01:01:45,088
He was in a coma.
I left the check.

1308
01:01:45,123 --> 01:01:46,249
Where is he?

1309
01:01:46,291 --> 01:01:48,633
Cedars. He's in intensive care.

1310
01:01:48,766 --> 01:01:50,461
You turned off
the electricity...

1311
01:01:50,501 --> 01:01:52,492
because you knew
he was telling the truth!

1312
01:01:52,537 --> 01:01:53,970
You could have resumed
that debate...

1313
01:01:54,005 --> 01:01:56,473
but you didn't want Americans
hearing what he had to say!

1314
01:01:56,507 --> 01:01:57,633
Don't bullshit me!

1315
01:01:57,675 --> 01:02:01,736
Go there. Sit with him.
Wait till he wakes up.

1316
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:04,441
You ask him if he canceled
the weekend research project.

1317
01:02:04,482 --> 01:02:05,881
OK? Now, if he didn't...

1318
01:02:05,917 --> 01:02:08,112
you ask him who's he gotta call,
all right?

1319
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:09,779
OK, boss.

1320
01:02:09,821 --> 01:02:11,220
Senator, when you have a moment.

1321
01:02:17,161 --> 01:02:18,355
Runnin' with my brothers

1322
01:02:18,396 --> 01:02:19,863
Headed for the home base

1323
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:22,230
With a steady pace on the face
they just replaced

1324
01:02:22,267 --> 01:02:24,531
Getting longer
than a motherfucking marathon

1325
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:26,230
If that's what I got to do

1326
01:02:26,271 --> 01:02:28,569
But nobody's picking up
a nigger with an attitude

1327
01:02:28,606 --> 01:02:30,597
Stuck and runnin' hard,
haulin' ass

1328
01:02:30,642 --> 01:02:33,008
'Cause I'm a nigger known
for having a notorious past

1329
01:02:33,044 --> 01:02:34,875
My mind was slick,
my temper was too quick

1330
01:02:34,913 --> 01:02:36,278
Now the FBI's all over my dick

1331
01:02:36,314 --> 01:02:37,645
Got us tick and running

1332
01:02:37,682 --> 01:02:39,309
Just to find the gun
that started the clock

1333
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:41,648
That's when the "E" jumped off
the starting block

1334
01:02:41,686 --> 01:02:43,779
A hundred miles from home,
and yo, it's a long stretch

1335
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:46,153
A little sprinting motherfucker
that they won't catch, yeah

1336
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,555
Runnin' like I just don't care

1337
01:02:47,592 --> 01:02:49,856
Compton's 50 miles,
but yo, I'm gonna get there

1338
01:02:49,894 --> 01:02:51,987
From city to city,
I'm a menace till I pass by

1339
01:02:52,030 --> 01:02:53,463
Ripping up shit
just so you can remember

1340
01:02:53,498 --> 01:02:54,988
I'm a straight-up nigger

1341
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:56,933
That's done in, gunnin',
and comin' straight at your ass

1342
01:02:56,968 --> 01:03:00,563
A hundred miles and running

1343
01:03:00,605 --> 01:03:02,539
Running like a nigger,
I hate to lose

1344
01:03:02,573 --> 01:03:04,473
Show me on the news,
but I hate to be abused

1345
01:03:04,509 --> 01:03:05,669
God...

1346
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:07,837
So now I'm gonna get up

1347
01:03:07,879 --> 01:03:09,278
You gotta get out.

1348
01:03:09,314 --> 01:03:11,077
You're crazy,
Jay Bulworth.

1349
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:27,260
Larry King is pissed about it,
and he's not alone!

1350
01:03:27,298 --> 01:03:28,424
How about the FCC?

1351
01:03:28,466 --> 01:03:31,526
Have you ever heard
of the F-C-fucking-C-C-C?

1352
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:33,434
OK, well,
now you listen to me.

1353
01:03:33,471 --> 01:03:35,871
You guys are running
an election special tonight...

1354
01:03:35,907 --> 01:03:37,465
and guess what?

1355
01:03:37,508 --> 01:03:39,703
I would like to have
my candidate on it.

1356
01:04:07,138 --> 01:04:08,901
Are we hiding again?

1357
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:10,874
'Cause I said
I got a safe place.

1358
01:04:10,908 --> 01:04:12,933
Oh, safe?

1359
01:04:19,350 --> 01:04:21,511
Every day is a holiday

1360
01:04:21,552 --> 01:04:22,678
Holiday

1361
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,051
Another motherfucking dollar day

1362
01:04:24,088 --> 01:04:25,988
Dollar day

1363
01:04:26,024 --> 01:04:27,082
Every day is a holiday

1364
01:04:27,125 --> 01:04:28,251
Holiday

1365
01:04:28,292 --> 01:04:30,123
Another motherfucking dollar day

1366
01:04:30,161 --> 01:04:31,128
Dollar day

1367
01:04:31,162 --> 01:04:32,322
Every day is a holiday

1368
01:04:32,363 --> 01:04:34,923
Safe, huh?

1369
01:04:37,668 --> 01:04:38,862
Hello.

1370
01:04:38,903 --> 01:04:42,361
Senator Bulworth, I think
we're gonna be back on track.

1371
01:04:42,407 --> 01:04:44,602
You gotta be back here at 7:30.

1372
01:04:44,642 --> 01:04:47,042
State of American
politics special.

1373
01:04:47,078 --> 01:04:49,569
It's mostly Dole and Clinton,
but they're featuring you, too.

1374
01:04:49,614 --> 01:04:51,775
Listen to the deal.
It'll be five minutes.

1375
01:04:51,816 --> 01:04:54,580
Five minutes. Live, no delay.

1376
01:04:54,619 --> 01:04:57,611
What do you mean you don't know?
Be back at 7:30.

1377
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:59,987
By the way, this thing of you
driving yourself?

1378
01:05:00,024 --> 01:05:02,788
I'm surprised
by how effective that is.

1379
01:05:02,827 --> 01:05:05,762
Jam?
You're not in a jam, Senator.

1380
01:05:05,797 --> 01:05:08,527
People are sick
of all the baloney.

1381
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:11,967
Safe? But I thought you didn't
want to play it safe.

1382
01:05:12,003 --> 01:05:13,903
This is not the time
to be safe.

1383
01:05:13,938 --> 01:05:17,601
Where are you anyway, sir?
Senator Bulworth?

1384
01:05:17,642 --> 01:05:19,310
Senator, I'm losing you, sir.
Hello?

1385
01:05:19,310 --> 01:05:20,277
Senator, I'm losing you, sir.
Hello?

1386
01:05:20,311 --> 01:05:21,972
Hello?

1387
01:05:26,017 --> 01:05:27,848
Senator Bulworth.

1388
01:05:37,628 --> 01:05:39,425
Wait here.

1389
01:05:39,464 --> 01:05:41,227
Insane in the membrane

1390
01:05:41,265 --> 01:05:42,630
Insane in the brain

1391
01:05:42,667 --> 01:05:45,693
Insane in the membrane

1392
01:05:45,736 --> 01:05:47,431
Insane in the brain

1393
01:05:47,472 --> 01:05:50,532
Come on in. Come in.

1394
01:05:56,047 --> 01:05:57,674
Hey, y'all.

1395
01:05:57,715 --> 01:05:59,580
Hey!

1396
01:06:00,618 --> 01:06:02,813
This is Senator Jay Bulworth.

1397
01:06:02,854 --> 01:06:04,754
- Hold on, Steve.
- Hi.

1398
01:06:04,789 --> 01:06:07,257
Well,
I'm Governor Tyrone Pickney...

1399
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:10,351
and this here is Osgood,
my Secretary of State...

1400
01:06:10,394 --> 01:06:12,589
and my Attorney General,
Denisha.

1401
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:13,824
Hey, Momma Doll...

1402
01:06:13,865 --> 01:06:15,162
we're feeding the Senator.

1403
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:16,359
Senator?

1404
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,958
You'll have
to take that suit off...

1405
01:06:18,002 --> 01:06:20,197
and get it cleaned
before you go back on TV.

1406
01:06:20,238 --> 01:06:23,207
Marcus Garvey,
get the man some pants.

1407
01:06:23,241 --> 01:06:24,401
Get him some pants.

1408
01:06:25,409 --> 01:06:26,671
How you doing?

1409
01:06:33,584 --> 01:06:35,176
Bulworth
unveiled a new strategy...

1410
01:06:35,219 --> 01:06:37,278
at a fundraising brunch
earlier today...

1411
01:06:37,321 --> 01:06:38,879
which sources within
the campaign said...

1412
01:06:38,923 --> 01:06:40,686
raised a million and a half
dollars.

1413
01:06:40,725 --> 01:06:43,091
Major contributors
were noncommittal when asked...

1414
01:06:43,127 --> 01:06:45,789
how they felt about Bulworth's
anti-business remarks.

1415
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:47,161
Later, in a televised...

1416
01:06:47,198 --> 01:06:50,326
Momma Doll
is me and Tyrone's mama.

1417
01:06:50,368 --> 01:06:53,030
Rafeeq there
is Tyrone's son by Vanetta.

1418
01:06:53,070 --> 01:06:54,697
She died in '83.

1419
01:06:54,739 --> 01:06:59,506
I am the sheik of Araby

1420
01:06:59,544 --> 01:07:03,036
Your love belongs to me

1421
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:05,844
Nina and Darnell's mama passed.

1422
01:07:05,883 --> 01:07:07,578
She was the baby.

1423
01:07:07,618 --> 01:07:09,085
No, uh-uh.

1424
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:12,180
I'm gonna tell this fool
I'm going to the cleaners.

1425
01:07:12,223 --> 01:07:14,555
The lights are low

1426
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:19,291
Between your legs I'll go

1427
01:07:21,899 --> 01:07:23,423
Stop playing with that food.

1428
01:07:23,467 --> 01:07:26,027
He ain't doing no harm,
Harriet, and if he is...

1429
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:28,095
I'll be the one to tell him.

1430
01:07:28,139 --> 01:07:30,903
I'm going to check on the suit.

1431
01:07:30,942 --> 01:07:32,705
Taking too long.

1432
01:07:32,743 --> 01:07:34,370
Ain't nobody talking to you.

1433
01:07:34,412 --> 01:07:35,572
Where you going?

1434
01:07:37,348 --> 01:07:38,576
Cleaners.

1435
01:07:38,616 --> 01:07:40,140
Oh.

1436
01:07:50,761 --> 01:07:54,026
How you like your greens,
General-- Senator?

1437
01:07:54,065 --> 01:07:56,295
I love collard greens.
Love 'em.

1438
01:07:56,334 --> 01:07:57,733
That's kale.

1439
01:07:57,768 --> 01:07:59,861
Oh, kale.

1440
01:07:59,904 --> 01:08:02,498
Insane in the membrane

1441
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:04,474
Insane in the brain

1442
01:08:04,508 --> 01:08:06,908
Insane in the membrane

1443
01:08:06,944 --> 01:08:08,673
Not a peep.

1444
01:08:08,713 --> 01:08:10,237
Doctor says there's no telling.

1445
01:08:10,281 --> 01:08:13,876
Davers, just wait there
till he wakes up.

1446
01:08:13,918 --> 01:08:16,250
Where'd you say
the cleaners was?

1447
01:08:16,287 --> 01:08:17,720
Two blocks down, one block over?

1448
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:25,160
You're going
outside in this neighborhood?

1449
01:08:25,196 --> 01:08:28,529
Insane in the membrane

1450
01:08:28,566 --> 01:08:30,659
Insane in the brain

1451
01:08:30,701 --> 01:08:33,431
Insane in the membrane

1452
01:08:33,471 --> 01:08:35,564
Went insane, got no brain

1453
01:08:35,606 --> 01:08:37,130
Insane in the membrane

1454
01:08:37,174 --> 01:08:39,574
Insane in the brain

1455
01:08:39,610 --> 01:08:40,975
Too much shit undercover

1456
01:08:41,012 --> 01:08:42,673
Now it's time for the blubber,
blabber

1457
01:08:42,713 --> 01:08:44,237
Watch that belly get fatter

1458
01:08:44,282 --> 01:08:45,442
Fat boy on a diet

1459
01:08:45,483 --> 01:08:47,417
Don't try it,
I'll jack your ass

1460
01:08:47,451 --> 01:08:49,180
Like a looter in a riot

1461
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,687
My shit's phat like a sumo

1462
01:08:50,721 --> 01:08:53,519
Slammin' that ass,
leaving your face in the grass

1463
01:08:53,557 --> 01:08:54,990
You know I don't take
a chulo lightly

1464
01:08:55,026 --> 01:08:56,653
Yo.

1465
01:08:59,530 --> 01:09:01,657
Hey, motherfucker,
you buying?

1466
01:09:04,869 --> 01:09:06,268
You buying or what?

1467
01:09:06,304 --> 01:09:08,772
No. I'm going to the cleaners.

1468
01:09:08,806 --> 01:09:09,966
Fuck you.

1469
01:09:10,975 --> 01:09:12,135
Fuck me.

1470
01:09:15,146 --> 01:09:16,841
We're doing business here,
cracker.

1471
01:09:16,881 --> 01:09:19,179
Wouldn't you rather have
some ice cream?

1472
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:21,047
I'm buying.

1473
01:09:23,454 --> 01:09:26,252
You let that man
go out by hisself?

1474
01:09:26,290 --> 01:09:27,587
The man is grown.

1475
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,219
I go out every day.
If I can go, he can.

1476
01:09:30,261 --> 01:09:31,990
A U.S. Senator should be OK...

1477
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:33,963
among his own constituents.

1478
01:09:49,333 --> 01:09:50,766
Hey!

1479
01:09:50,801 --> 01:09:53,235
You little spooks
find some extra cash today?

1480
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,567
Fuck you.

1481
01:10:03,247 --> 01:10:05,078
You little
black piece of shit.

1482
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:06,309
Did you say "fuck you" to me?

1483
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:08,784
No, sir.

1484
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:13,012
I said fuck your mama.

1485
01:10:30,974 --> 01:10:32,805
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

1486
01:10:32,843 --> 01:10:34,037
Come on.

1487
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:39,975
Everybody freeze!
Freeze! Freeze!

1488
01:10:40,017 --> 01:10:41,143
Nobody move!

1489
01:10:41,185 --> 01:10:43,346
Hey, you freeze!

1490
01:10:43,387 --> 01:10:45,514
You chicken hawk faggot.
Get on the ground...

1491
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:47,046
or I'm going to blow
your brains out!

1492
01:10:47,091 --> 01:10:48,217
Could I have
your badge number?

1493
01:10:48,258 --> 01:10:51,819
Kiss my ass, badge number!
On the ground, right now!

1494
01:10:51,862 --> 01:10:53,853
I think you ought
to give me your name.

1495
01:10:53,897 --> 01:10:55,159
My name? Shut up!

1496
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:57,064
Get on the ground
and do it now!

1497
01:10:57,101 --> 01:10:59,331
- Mark.
- Get down or you're dead!

1498
01:10:59,369 --> 01:11:02,770
Get down or I'm gonna blow
your fuckin' brains out!

1499
01:11:02,806 --> 01:11:04,865
Mark! No, no, no, Mark!

1500
01:11:04,908 --> 01:11:06,205
This is Jay Bulworth.

1501
01:11:07,344 --> 01:11:09,039
This is Jay Bulworth, Mark.

1502
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:10,444
It's Senator Jay Bulworth.

1503
01:11:10,481 --> 01:11:12,449
- I don't give a--
- Senator?

1504
01:11:12,483 --> 01:11:14,451
- Senator Bulworth...
- Shit!

1505
01:11:14,485 --> 01:11:16,715
This is my partner, Mark.

1506
01:11:16,754 --> 01:11:17,880
Hi, Mark.

1507
01:11:19,123 --> 01:11:22,058
What the fuck
is going on here? Sir.

1508
01:11:22,092 --> 01:11:26,051
If you get in your car, I won't
recognize you in a lineup.

1509
01:11:26,096 --> 01:11:28,997
And it'd be a good idea
to say, "I'm sorry," huh?

1510
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,964
Oh, man, I waited my whole life
for this moment.

1511
01:11:33,003 --> 01:11:35,335
I'm...

1512
01:11:35,372 --> 01:11:36,498
sorry.

1513
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:38,269
Say, "No problem, Officer."

1514
01:11:38,308 --> 01:11:41,334
Oh, fuck your mama,
you fuckin' pig cocksucker.

1515
01:11:41,378 --> 01:11:43,369
That's good enough. Take off.

1516
01:11:43,413 --> 01:11:45,244
Stupid ass, huh?

1517
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:51,619
Wha...

1518
01:11:54,525 --> 01:11:56,823
Oh, y'all, look. L.D.

1519
01:11:56,860 --> 01:11:58,725
L.D.! Kickin' ass, man.

1520
01:11:58,762 --> 01:11:59,922
You lookin' for Nina?

1521
01:11:59,963 --> 01:12:03,865
Open a can of whup ass!

1522
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:06,062
Insane in the brain

1523
01:12:06,103 --> 01:12:08,799
Insane in the membrane

1524
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:10,807
Insane in the brain

1525
01:12:10,841 --> 01:12:12,308
Insane in the membrane

1526
01:12:12,342 --> 01:12:16,711
Insane, got no brain

1527
01:12:16,747 --> 01:12:19,477
Everything's lined up,
all perfect and in sync.

1528
01:12:19,516 --> 01:12:21,848
The guy stumbles over his dick
into his greatest opportunity...

1529
01:12:21,885 --> 01:12:24,080
then decides
he might not show up.

1530
01:12:24,121 --> 01:12:26,248
You might ask,
"Why the fuck not?"

1531
01:12:26,290 --> 01:12:28,724
"I don't want to talk about it."

1532
01:12:28,759 --> 01:12:32,559
You don't wanna talk about it?
You were on a fuckin' roll.

1533
01:12:32,596 --> 01:12:33,858
Our commitment...

1534
01:12:33,897 --> 01:12:35,592
to carry those enduring ideals
with us...

1535
01:12:35,632 --> 01:12:38,567
will renew their promise
in a new century...

1536
01:12:38,602 --> 01:12:40,263
and a new millennium.

1537
01:12:40,304 --> 01:12:41,430
We have got...

1538
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:45,202
We've got to balance
the federal budget.

1539
01:12:45,242 --> 01:12:47,540
Wanna see me
balance a spoon on my nose?

1540
01:12:47,578 --> 01:12:51,207
People who like
government programs that--

1541
01:12:51,248 --> 01:12:52,806
Shit.

1542
01:12:59,823 --> 01:13:01,222
Where's Nina?

1543
01:13:01,258 --> 01:13:03,283
Good lookin' out
on the shorties, you know?

1544
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:05,386
It ain't every day
that a white man...

1545
01:13:05,429 --> 01:13:07,056
comes to rescue
my little soldiers.

1546
01:13:07,097 --> 01:13:08,189
I appreciate it, you know?

1547
01:13:08,232 --> 01:13:09,392
Little soldiers?

1548
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:16,629
Uh, what--what exactly
do you know about it?

1549
01:13:16,673 --> 01:13:20,302
Your ass live up in
Beverly Hills somewhere, right?

1550
01:13:20,344 --> 01:13:22,608
I provide for these
little brothers right here.

1551
01:13:22,646 --> 01:13:25,080
These little brothers
is my first line of defense.

1552
01:13:25,115 --> 01:13:26,673
They my little eyes and ears.

1553
01:13:26,717 --> 01:13:27,979
Where's Nina?

1554
01:13:29,953 --> 01:13:32,649
I'm givin' them
entry-level positions...

1555
01:13:32,689 --> 01:13:34,748
into the only growth-sector
occupation...

1556
01:13:34,791 --> 01:13:36,258
truly open to them right now.

1557
01:13:36,293 --> 01:13:38,022
That's the substance
supply industry.

1558
01:13:38,061 --> 01:13:39,426
They gonna run this shit
someday.

1559
01:13:39,463 --> 01:13:41,192
They gonna have
the whole empire.

1560
01:13:41,231 --> 01:13:44,496
You don't give a fuck about it.
You greedy-ass politicians.

1561
01:13:44,534 --> 01:13:46,263
That's what you tell me...

1562
01:13:46,303 --> 01:13:48,771
every time y'all vote
to cut them school programs...

1563
01:13:48,805 --> 01:13:51,273
and vote to cut them funds
to the job programs.

1564
01:13:51,308 --> 01:13:54,368
Fuck, how a man gonna handle his
financial responsibilities...

1565
01:13:54,411 --> 01:13:55,639
workin' at motherfuckin'
Burger King?

1566
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,374
He ain't.

1567
01:13:57,414 --> 01:13:59,348
And don't start
with the school shit.

1568
01:13:59,383 --> 01:14:02,250
They ain't no education goin'
on up in that motherfucker.

1569
01:14:02,286 --> 01:14:04,982
Y'all motherfuckin' politicians
done fucked the shit up.

1570
01:14:05,022 --> 01:14:08,651
So what they gonna do?
What a man supposed to do, then?

1571
01:14:08,692 --> 01:14:10,182
He gonna come to me,
that's what.

1572
01:14:10,227 --> 01:14:11,990
Why? 'Cause I'm a businessman.

1573
01:14:12,029 --> 01:14:14,054
As a businessman, you gotta
limit your liabilities.

1574
01:14:14,097 --> 01:14:16,657
That's what these shorties
offer me - limited liabilities...

1575
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,134
because of their limited
vulnerability...

1576
01:14:19,169 --> 01:14:20,397
to legal sanctions.

1577
01:14:20,437 --> 01:14:23,167
It's the same fuckin' thing
in politics, Dog.

1578
01:14:23,206 --> 01:14:25,003
You find an edge,
you exploit it.

1579
01:14:25,042 --> 01:14:27,636
That's why y'all sent them
motherfuckin' teenagers to Iraq.

1580
01:14:27,678 --> 01:14:29,737
Die over some motherfuckin'
oil money.

1581
01:14:29,780 --> 01:14:31,907
Send the motherfuckin' CIA
up in the 'hood...

1582
01:14:31,949 --> 01:14:34,042
with all the yayos.
Slangin' in the 'hood.

1583
01:14:34,084 --> 01:14:36,075
It's the same shit in politics.

1584
01:14:39,189 --> 01:14:40,588
There's a time when every homie

1585
01:14:40,624 --> 01:14:42,057
Got to risk his neck and fight

1586
01:14:42,092 --> 01:14:43,855
For the thing that he believe in

1587
01:14:43,894 --> 01:14:45,327
And he got to preach it right

1588
01:14:45,362 --> 01:14:47,626
If he don't got shit to die for

1589
01:14:47,664 --> 01:14:49,029
And he's 'fraid
to shed the light

1590
01:14:49,066 --> 01:14:51,364
Then he ain't got shit
to live for, scumbag

1591
01:14:53,770 --> 01:14:56,238
Is that how white people rap?

1592
01:14:56,273 --> 01:14:58,867
Goddamn,
it's a brand-new payback

1593
01:14:58,909 --> 01:15:01,639
But gangsta Mac,
his drugs tested black

1594
01:15:01,678 --> 01:15:03,441
How many motherfuckers
gotta pay?

1595
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:05,471
Make sure before you fuck quick,
duck quick

1596
01:15:05,515 --> 01:15:06,777
Dig?

1597
01:15:06,817 --> 01:15:09,752
'Cause I'm the wrong nigger
to fuck with

1598
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:13,347
Last person in the world
you wanna fuck with.

1599
01:15:17,928 --> 01:15:19,623
You gonna hang with this man?

1600
01:15:22,099 --> 01:15:24,397
After your mama's life
was ruined by a white man?

1601
01:15:24,434 --> 01:15:25,958
You know how I feel.

1602
01:15:26,003 --> 01:15:29,063
You been like a daddy, Tyrone,
but I ain't my mama.

1603
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:32,709
I just hate seeing you
get involved...

1604
01:15:32,743 --> 01:15:34,210
in what you gettin'
involved in.

1605
01:15:34,244 --> 01:15:36,439
You ain't got no idea
what I'm involved in.

1606
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:42,448
Tonight on American
Politics Election Special...

1607
01:15:42,486 --> 01:15:44,215
Bill Clinton, Bob Dole...

1608
01:15:44,254 --> 01:15:46,245
Jay Bulworth, Alan Simpson...

1609
01:15:46,289 --> 01:15:49,417
Bill Bradley, Pat Buchanan,
and Ross Perot.

1610
01:15:49,459 --> 01:15:51,188
All appearing live tonight...

1611
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:54,061
on American Politics
Election Special.

1612
01:15:59,302 --> 01:16:00,530
What do you think?

1613
01:16:01,505 --> 01:16:02,631
What do I think?

1614
01:16:02,672 --> 01:16:04,902
Hey, yo, L.D.,
that motherfucker took your car.

1615
01:16:04,941 --> 01:16:06,067
Dude took my car?

1616
01:16:06,109 --> 01:16:07,337
That shit is gone.

1617
01:16:12,716 --> 01:16:15,116
- Y'all go get everybody.
- Come on, brother.

1618
01:16:17,654 --> 01:16:19,417
Let's get on the news, baby.

1619
01:16:19,456 --> 01:16:21,947
Like I said,
it's a brand-new payback

1620
01:16:21,992 --> 01:16:24,654
Now in '91,
let's see who beats the jack

1621
01:16:24,694 --> 01:16:26,218
And watch the devil
start kickin'

1622
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:29,130
Run around like a chicken

1623
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,600
Grand Dragon, finger-lickin'

1624
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:33,500
Yo, turn him over
with a spatula

1625
01:16:33,537 --> 01:16:35,471
Now we got Kentucky-fried
cracker

1626
01:16:35,505 --> 01:16:38,668
Mess with the Cube
you get cut quick, pig

1627
01:16:38,708 --> 01:16:41,040
'Cause I'm the wrong nigger
to fuck with

1628
01:16:43,046 --> 01:16:45,412
'Cause I'm the wrong nigger
to fuck with

1629
01:16:46,683 --> 01:16:48,275
Uh, excuse me, Bart...

1630
01:16:48,318 --> 01:16:50,411
do we have any idea
where Bulworth is?

1631
01:16:50,454 --> 01:16:51,751
Give him
two more minutes, Connie.

1632
01:16:51,788 --> 01:16:54,120
Irving, do we have
Forbes and Buchanan both?

1633
01:16:54,157 --> 01:16:57,149
It's about time that people
started saying "Ebonics."

1634
01:16:57,194 --> 01:16:58,456
All right, great.

1635
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:02,158
'Cause I'm
the wrong nigger to fuck with

1636
01:17:04,568 --> 01:17:06,627
Don't let me catch
Daryl Gates in traffic

1637
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:09,070
I got a habit,
blow his cap backwards

1638
01:17:09,106 --> 01:17:10,596
I hope he wears his vest, too

1639
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:11,937
And his dress blue

1640
01:17:11,975 --> 01:17:13,465
Goin' up against a Zulu

1641
01:17:13,510 --> 01:17:15,341
Make him squirm like a jellyfish

1642
01:17:15,378 --> 01:17:17,642
Kick his ass
till I smell his shit

1643
01:17:17,681 --> 01:17:20,309
Off with their head,
off with their head I say

1644
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,181
And watch the devil
start kickin'

1645
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:24,517
'Cause I'm the wrong nigger
to fuck with

1646
01:17:24,554 --> 01:17:26,488
Excuse me, sir?

1647
01:17:26,523 --> 01:17:27,854
Senator Bulworth,
is that you, sir?

1648
01:17:27,891 --> 01:17:30,155
Senator Bulworth?

1649
01:17:30,193 --> 01:17:32,354
Think you want a coat and tie?

1650
01:17:32,395 --> 01:17:34,295
Hey, what's happenin', my man?

1651
01:17:34,331 --> 01:17:35,832
I'm gonna have to get that tan

1652
01:17:35,832 --> 01:17:36,980
...strategy is to reflect
every Republican theme...

1653
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:39,073
...strategy is to reflect
every Republican theme...

1654
01:17:39,115 --> 01:17:42,243
while opposing
every Republican reform.

1655
01:17:42,285 --> 01:17:45,721
And rather than contend
for an agenda of his own...

1656
01:17:45,755 --> 01:17:48,315
I think it's important
for you to have longer pants.

1657
01:17:48,358 --> 01:17:51,191
As a matter of fact,
the shorter pants...

1658
01:17:51,228 --> 01:17:54,220
have a certain, a certain
urban youthful quality, sir.

1659
01:17:54,264 --> 01:17:56,027
The glasses are good,
but I don't--

1660
01:17:56,066 --> 01:17:57,499
I really wanna see your eyes.

1661
01:17:57,534 --> 01:17:59,126
The hat's wonderful.
Like the hat.

1662
01:17:59,169 --> 01:18:01,034
Budweiser on the blimp.

1663
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:03,403
They're selling
"get drunk and fly around."

1664
01:18:03,506 --> 01:18:05,235
The people
at Fidelity Providence...

1665
01:18:05,275 --> 01:18:06,970
have been helping
support and protect families...

1666
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,068
for over 100 years.

1667
01:18:08,111 --> 01:18:09,874
Senator, the glasses...

1668
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:13,349
That's the style, isn't it?
That's the style.

1669
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:14,850
...by providing
a variety of health plans...

1670
01:18:14,884 --> 01:18:16,579
life insurance policies...

1671
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,918
real estate investments,
not only for families...

1672
01:18:18,955 --> 01:18:21,355
but for the changing face
of America.

1673
01:18:21,391 --> 01:18:24,485
You can trust Fidelity
Providence with your future.

1674
01:18:24,527 --> 01:18:27,087
Welcome back.
In our Los Angeles studio...

1675
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:28,995
we have incumbent
Democratic Senator...

1676
01:18:29,032 --> 01:18:30,863
Jay Bulworth of California.

1677
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,094
Good evening, Senator.

1678
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:36,862
Senator,
why this new campaign style?

1679
01:18:39,442 --> 01:18:42,309
Why this new manner
of dress and speech?

1680
01:18:44,147 --> 01:18:47,708
Your ethnic manner
of speech, your--your clothes...

1681
01:18:49,786 --> 01:18:51,253
The use of obscenity.

1682
01:18:51,288 --> 01:18:52,778
Obscenity?

1683
01:18:52,822 --> 01:18:54,847
But, gee, my third cousin?

1684
01:18:54,891 --> 01:18:57,052
OK, he was. It's true.
On the playground...

1685
01:18:57,093 --> 01:18:59,561
and they're tryin' to get it
above the rim.

1686
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:01,860
I think it's great.
I like it better.

1687
01:19:01,898 --> 01:19:03,559
I'm not begrudging him that,
are you?

1688
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:05,761
Of course not.
Of course I'm not.

1689
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:08,032
The rich is gettin'
richer and richer and richer

1690
01:19:08,071 --> 01:19:10,198
While the middle class
is gettin' more poor

1691
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,902
Just makin' billions
and billions and billions

1692
01:19:12,942 --> 01:19:15,570
And billions and billions
and billions of bucks

1693
01:19:15,612 --> 01:19:16,943
Well, my friend

1694
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:19,972
lf, uh, you weren't
already rich at the start

1695
01:19:20,016 --> 01:19:21,916
That--that--that situation sucks

1696
01:19:21,951 --> 01:19:26,012
'Cause the--the richest
motherfucker in five of us

1697
01:19:26,056 --> 01:19:28,217
Is gettin' ninety-fuckin'
eight percent of it

1698
01:19:28,258 --> 01:19:30,692
And every other motherfucker
in the world

1699
01:19:30,727 --> 01:19:33,252
Is left to wonder where the fuck
we went with it

1700
01:19:33,296 --> 01:19:34,422
Obscenity?

1701
01:19:34,464 --> 01:19:35,624
I'm a senator

1702
01:19:35,665 --> 01:19:38,429
I gotta raise $10,000 a day
every day I'm in Washington

1703
01:19:38,468 --> 01:19:39,867
I ain't gettin' it
in South Central

1704
01:19:39,903 --> 01:19:41,700
I'm gettin' it
in Beverly Hills

1705
01:19:41,738 --> 01:19:44,206
So I'm votin' in the Senate
the way they want me to

1706
01:19:44,240 --> 01:19:46,265
and--and--and
I'm sendin' them my bills

1707
01:19:46,309 --> 01:19:48,504
But we got babies
in South Central

1708
01:19:48,545 --> 01:19:50,103
dyin' as young
as they do in Peru

1709
01:19:50,146 --> 01:19:52,273
We got public schools
that are nightmares

1710
01:19:52,315 --> 01:19:54,840
We got a Congress
that ain't got a clue

1711
01:19:54,884 --> 01:19:56,784
We got kids
with submachine guns

1712
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,344
We got militias
throwing bombs

1713
01:19:58,388 --> 01:20:00,151
We got Bill
just gettin' all weepy

1714
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:01,987
We got Newt blamin' teenage moms

1715
01:20:02,025 --> 01:20:03,856
We have factories closin' down

1716
01:20:03,893 --> 01:20:05,758
Where the hell
did all the good jobs go?

1717
01:20:05,795 --> 01:20:07,319
Well, I'll tell you
where they went

1718
01:20:07,364 --> 01:20:11,460
My contributors make more
profits makin', makin', makin'

1719
01:20:11,501 --> 01:20:12,798
Hirin' kids in Mexico

1720
01:20:12,836 --> 01:20:14,861
Oh, brother can work
in fast food

1721
01:20:14,904 --> 01:20:16,428
If he can't invent
computer games

1722
01:20:16,473 --> 01:20:18,031
But what we used
to call America

1723
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:19,371
That's goin' down the drains

1724
01:20:19,409 --> 01:20:21,809
How's a young man gonna meet
his financial responsibilities

1725
01:20:21,845 --> 01:20:24,279
Workin' in a motherfuckin'
Burger King? He ain't!

1726
01:20:24,314 --> 01:20:26,305
And please, don't even
start with that school shit

1727
01:20:26,349 --> 01:20:28,340
There ain't no education
goin' on up in that motherfucker

1728
01:20:28,385 --> 01:20:29,579
Obscenity?

1729
01:20:29,619 --> 01:20:31,280
We got a million brothers
in prison

1730
01:20:31,321 --> 01:20:33,084
I mean,
the walls are really rockin'

1731
01:20:33,123 --> 01:20:34,784
But you can bet your ass
they'd all be out

1732
01:20:34,824 --> 01:20:36,655
If they could pay
for Johnnie Cochran

1733
01:20:36,693 --> 01:20:38,661
The Constitution's supposed
to give them an equal chance

1734
01:20:38,695 --> 01:20:40,162
Well, that ain't gonna happen
for sure

1735
01:20:40,196 --> 01:20:42,426
Ain't it time to take a little
from the rich motherfucker

1736
01:20:42,465 --> 01:20:44,023
And just give a little
to the poor?

1737
01:20:44,067 --> 01:20:45,694
I mean, those boys over there
on the monitor

1738
01:20:45,735 --> 01:20:48,033
They want a government
smaller and weak

1739
01:20:48,071 --> 01:20:49,868
But they be speaking
for the richest 20 percent

1740
01:20:49,906 --> 01:20:51,806
When they pretendin'
they defendin' the meek

1741
01:20:51,841 --> 01:20:54,435
Now, shit, fuck, cocksucker

1742
01:20:54,477 --> 01:20:55,637
That's the real obscenity

1743
01:20:55,678 --> 01:20:57,543
Black folks
livin' with every day

1744
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,946
Is tryin' to believe
a motherfuckin' word

1745
01:20:59,983 --> 01:21:01,814
Democrats and Republicans say

1746
01:21:01,851 --> 01:21:03,318
Obscenity?

1747
01:21:03,353 --> 01:21:05,412
I'm Jay Billington Bulworth

1748
01:21:05,455 --> 01:21:06,922
And I've come to say

1749
01:21:06,956 --> 01:21:08,651
The Democratic party's

1750
01:21:08,691 --> 01:21:10,659
Got some shit to pay

1751
01:21:10,693 --> 01:21:13,685
It's gonna pay it in the ghetto

1752
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:16,221
It's gonna pay it in the--

1753
01:21:18,001 --> 01:21:20,401
Senator, are you saying
that the Democratic party...

1754
01:21:20,437 --> 01:21:21,631
doesn't care about
the African-American community?

1755
01:21:21,671 --> 01:21:24,105
Isn't that obvious?
A lot of people think...

1756
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:26,199
there are no black leaders today
because they all got killed...

1757
01:21:26,242 --> 01:21:29,006
but I think it's the decimation
of the manufacturing base...

1758
01:21:29,045 --> 01:21:30,171
in the urban centers.

1759
01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:31,612
Don't you think so?

1760
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,115
What do you think my age is?

1761
01:21:33,149 --> 01:21:34,639
He's had his time. Flush 'im.

1762
01:21:34,684 --> 01:21:36,117
You know, the guy in the booth

1763
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:37,676
Who's talking to you
in that tiny little earphone?

1764
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,915
He's afraid the guys at network
gonna tell him he's through

1765
01:21:39,956 --> 01:21:42,254
If he lets a guy keep talking
like I'm talking to you

1766
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:43,418
'Cause the corporations
got the networks

1767
01:21:43,460 --> 01:21:45,928
And they get to say who gets
to talk about the country

1768
01:21:45,962 --> 01:21:47,122
And who's crazy today

1769
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:49,358
I would cut to a commercial
if you still want this job

1770
01:21:49,399 --> 01:21:52,232
Because you may not be back
tomorrow with this corporate mob

1771
01:21:52,268 --> 01:21:53,758
- Cut to a commercial
- OK, flush 'em.

1772
01:21:53,803 --> 01:21:56,601
Cut to commercial,
cut to commercial

1773
01:21:56,639 --> 01:21:57,901
Cut to commercial

1774
01:21:57,941 --> 01:21:59,636
OK, OK, I got a simple question

1775
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:01,371
That I'd like to ask
of this network

1776
01:22:01,411 --> 01:22:03,538
That pays you
for performing your task

1777
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,309
How come they got the airwaves?

1778
01:22:05,348 --> 01:22:06,872
They're the people's,
aren't they?

1779
01:22:06,916 --> 01:22:10,044
Wouldn't they be worth
70 billion to the public today?

1780
01:22:10,086 --> 01:22:11,781
If some money-grubbin' Congress

1781
01:22:11,821 --> 01:22:14,381
Didn't give 'em away
for big campaign money?

1782
01:22:14,424 --> 01:22:16,221
It's hopeless, you see

1783
01:22:16,259 --> 01:22:18,227
If you runnin' for office

1784
01:22:18,261 --> 01:22:19,785
Without no TV

1785
01:22:19,829 --> 01:22:20,955
If you don't get big money

1786
01:22:20,997 --> 01:22:22,362
You get a defeat

1787
01:22:22,398 --> 01:22:24,992
Corporations and broadcasters
make you dead meat

1788
01:22:25,034 --> 01:22:27,901
You been taught in this country
there's speech that is free

1789
01:22:27,937 --> 01:22:31,304
But free do not get you
no spots on TV

1790
01:22:31,341 --> 01:22:34,310
If you want to have senators
not on the take

1791
01:22:34,344 --> 01:22:36,312
Then give them free air time

1792
01:22:36,346 --> 01:22:38,143
They won't have to fake

1793
01:22:38,181 --> 01:22:40,615
Telecommunications
is the name of the beast

1794
01:22:40,650 --> 01:22:42,049
That, that, that, that...

1795
01:22:42,085 --> 01:22:44,576
That's eatin' up the world
from the West to the East

1796
01:22:44,621 --> 01:22:47,488
The movies, the tabloids,
TV, and magazines

1797
01:22:47,524 --> 01:22:49,082
They tell us
what to think and do

1798
01:22:49,125 --> 01:22:50,387
And all our hopes and dreams

1799
01:22:50,426 --> 01:22:52,826
All this information
makes America phat

1800
01:22:52,862 --> 01:22:54,386
But if the company's
out of the country

1801
01:22:54,430 --> 01:22:55,761
How American is that?

1802
01:22:55,798 --> 01:22:57,197
But we got Americans
with families

1803
01:22:57,233 --> 01:22:58,393
Can't even buy a meal

1804
01:22:58,434 --> 01:23:00,129
Ask a brother
who's been downsized

1805
01:23:00,169 --> 01:23:01,636
If he's gettin' any deal

1806
01:23:01,671 --> 01:23:04,139
Or a white boy bustin' ass
till they put him in his grave

1807
01:23:04,173 --> 01:23:06,471
He ain't gotta be a black boy
to be livin' like a slave

1808
01:23:06,509 --> 01:23:09,205
Rich people have always
stayed on top

1809
01:23:09,245 --> 01:23:11,975
By dividing white people
from colored people

1810
01:23:12,015 --> 01:23:14,449
But white people got more
in common with colored people

1811
01:23:14,484 --> 01:23:15,644
Than they do with rich people

1812
01:23:15,685 --> 01:23:17,448
We just got to eliminate them

1813
01:23:17,487 --> 01:23:20,479
- Eliminate?
- Eliminate.

1814
01:23:20,523 --> 01:23:22,013
- Who, rich people?
- White people.

1815
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:24,026
- Damn!
- Black people, too.

1816
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,824
Brown people, yellow people.
Get rid of 'em all.

1817
01:23:26,863 --> 01:23:28,330
All we need is a voluntary...

1818
01:23:28,364 --> 01:23:30,855
free-spirited,
open-ended program...

1819
01:23:30,900 --> 01:23:33,300
of procreative
racial deconstruction.

1820
01:23:35,171 --> 01:23:37,002
Everybody just gotta
keep fuckin' everybody...

1821
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:38,200
till they're all the same color.

1822
01:23:38,241 --> 01:23:39,708
Damn!

1823
01:23:39,742 --> 01:23:42,336
I think it--it's gonna
take a while, but, uh--

1824
01:23:46,015 --> 01:23:47,539
Thank you, Senator Bulworth.

1825
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,814
We'll return with former
Governor Lamar Alexander...

1826
01:23:49,852 --> 01:23:50,978
after this message.

1827
01:23:53,056 --> 01:23:55,217
Kill 'em live

1828
01:23:55,258 --> 01:23:57,385
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1829
01:23:57,427 --> 01:23:59,554
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1830
01:23:59,596 --> 01:24:01,188
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1831
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:03,323
My man hits the body

1832
01:24:03,366 --> 01:24:05,061
Bustin' caps and hardly misses

1833
01:24:05,101 --> 01:24:07,535
Call the taxi,
makin' sure that it records ya

1834
01:24:07,570 --> 01:24:09,401
For my midnight plane to Georgia

1835
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,169
Agent double-O player,
the life giver

1836
01:24:12,208 --> 01:24:14,904
The name William,
Propaganda can't gas

1837
01:24:14,944 --> 01:24:15,740
The last man standing

1838
01:24:15,878 --> 01:24:17,051
Assassinate all the planet

1839
01:24:17,685 --> 01:24:19,949
Give 'em crack,
what you see is what you get

1840
01:24:19,987 --> 01:24:22,148
More stars to truck

1841
01:24:22,189 --> 01:24:23,850
21st-century Robin Hood

1842
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:26,018
Against the politics
of robbin' 'hoods

1843
01:24:26,060 --> 01:24:28,221
Fought the government
'cause you know I would

1844
01:24:28,262 --> 01:24:30,287
'Cause the FBI's up to no good

1845
01:24:30,331 --> 01:24:32,959
Power to the people
to cover their own trunk

1846
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:34,831
Don't end up like a street punk

1847
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:37,099
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1848
01:24:37,138 --> 01:24:38,867
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1849
01:24:38,906 --> 01:24:40,635
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1850
01:24:40,675 --> 01:24:44,441
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1851
01:24:44,478 --> 01:24:46,639
Uh, kill 'em live

1852
01:25:24,185 --> 01:25:25,777
Bulworth?

1853
01:25:25,820 --> 01:25:27,617
I think you should
get some sleep.

1854
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:29,623
He's--You gotta
get away from him.

1855
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:31,284
This guy's a hitman.
He's got a gun.

1856
01:25:31,325 --> 01:25:32,519
Shoot 'em together.

1857
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,257
Are you shooting them both?

1858
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,265
Move over here
and get 'em in a two-shot.

1859
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:39,425
I already got one.

1860
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,697
This ain't worth shit
without a two-shot.

1861
01:25:41,736 --> 01:25:43,863
I got it. I got it. I got one.

1862
01:25:43,904 --> 01:25:45,269
Yeah, yeah, like that.

1863
01:25:45,306 --> 01:25:47,399
Get back up over here.
Here's the picture. Right here.

1864
01:25:47,441 --> 01:25:48,601
You're not getting the shot!

1865
01:25:48,642 --> 01:25:51,110
Damn it!
You're not getting the picture!

1866
01:25:51,145 --> 01:25:53,113
- She's leaving.
- I got 'em together.

1867
01:25:53,147 --> 01:25:55,206
- Stand over here!
- Get off my case!

1868
01:25:55,249 --> 01:25:57,444
I'm not on your case.
Did you get the--

1869
01:25:57,485 --> 01:25:58,952
Of course I did.
Two people.

1870
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:05,155
I'm concerned
you didn't get the shot.

1871
01:26:05,192 --> 01:26:06,591
I got the shot!

1872
01:26:06,627 --> 01:26:07,753
Kill 'em live

1873
01:26:07,795 --> 01:26:09,592
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1874
01:26:09,630 --> 01:26:12,121
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1875
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:14,327
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

1876
01:26:14,368 --> 01:26:15,960
Respect puts kids
without a battle

1877
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:17,732
Politicians assassinated

1878
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:19,262
Rappers get shot

1879
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:21,240
For the haves
and the have-nots

1880
01:26:21,275 --> 01:26:24,836
The question we ask

1881
01:26:24,879 --> 01:26:27,973
Keeps the haves and
the have-nots guessin'

1882
01:26:28,015 --> 01:26:31,314
A new Smith and Wesson,
Wesson, Wesson

1883
01:26:31,352 --> 01:26:33,718
It wasn't the guy.

1884
01:27:21,368 --> 01:27:23,495
Uh...

1885
01:27:35,816 --> 01:27:38,979
A few days ago,
I made a deal with a guy...

1886
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:41,487
for a lot of life insurance...

1887
01:27:41,522 --> 01:27:42,716
and then l, uh...

1888
01:27:42,756 --> 01:27:45,691
I paid a guy to hire a guy
to get rid of me.

1889
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:56,396
I tried to call it off...

1890
01:27:56,437 --> 01:27:58,462
but the guy I paid
had a heart attack.

1891
01:27:58,506 --> 01:28:00,531
He's in the hospital
in a coma...

1892
01:28:00,574 --> 01:28:03,372
and there's absolutely no way
to contact whoever the guy is...

1893
01:28:03,410 --> 01:28:05,435
that he hired to do the job
and tell him it's off.

1894
01:28:05,479 --> 01:28:08,539
You know,
there's a lesson here...

1895
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:12,279
which is never try to make
life or death decisions...

1896
01:28:12,319 --> 01:28:16,813
when you're--
when you're feelin' suicidal...

1897
01:28:16,857 --> 01:28:19,087
because you--you can't...

1898
01:28:24,999 --> 01:28:26,591
Vinnie's too cheap
to hire a hitman.

1899
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:28,932
All I had to do
was get you upstairs.

1900
01:28:28,969 --> 01:28:31,904
He was the one who was gonna
push you off the balcony.

1901
01:28:31,939 --> 01:28:33,031
But I didn't get you up there.

1902
01:28:33,073 --> 01:28:36,702
He said if I wanted the money,
I'd have to do it myself.

1903
01:28:49,990 --> 01:28:51,719
Here.

1904
01:29:02,903 --> 01:29:04,768
I changed my mind.

1905
01:29:04,805 --> 01:29:07,296
Huh?

1906
01:29:20,588 --> 01:29:22,886
What?

1907
01:29:42,743 --> 01:29:45,439
So...you get it?

1908
01:29:45,479 --> 01:29:48,778
Ain't nobody gonna kill you.

1909
01:29:51,852 --> 01:29:54,685
You get it?

1910
01:29:57,825 --> 01:29:59,725
Jay?

1911
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:46,865
Senator Jay Bulworth,
elaborately costumed...

1912
01:30:46,907 --> 01:30:49,239
made no explanation
or apologies...

1913
01:30:49,276 --> 01:30:51,540
for what seemed a much
more casual and comfortable...

1914
01:30:51,578 --> 01:30:53,603
mode of dress and behavior.

1915
01:30:53,647 --> 01:30:56,081
How's a man gonna
meet his responsibilities...

1916
01:30:56,116 --> 01:30:57,674
workin' in a mother
Burger King?

1917
01:30:57,718 --> 01:31:00,312
He ain't! And please don't even
start with that school

1918
01:31:00,354 --> 01:31:02,083
Ain't no education going on
up in that mother

1919
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:04,655
Obscenity? I'm a senator.

1920
01:31:04,692 --> 01:31:06,887
- You guys shut up.
- Brothers in prisons.

1921
01:31:06,927 --> 01:31:08,155
I mean, the walls
are really rockin'

1922
01:31:08,195 --> 01:31:10,493
Shut up, Tony!

1923
01:31:10,531 --> 01:31:12,999
...if they could pay
for Johnny Cochran

1924
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,193
This morning...

1925
01:31:15,235 --> 01:31:16,998
the Senator's conferring
with top advisors.

1926
01:31:17,037 --> 01:31:19,267
Yes, I know I'm a top advisor,
and guess what?

1927
01:31:19,306 --> 01:31:21,774
I'll be conferring
with him, too. Good morning.

1928
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:25,336
Hi, Sandy. Of course I know
where he is. Advisors.

1929
01:31:25,379 --> 01:31:26,676
He's conferring with advisors.

1930
01:31:26,714 --> 01:31:29,012
Yeah. OK. Bye.

1931
01:31:31,452 --> 01:31:33,010
Where the fuck is he?

1932
01:31:33,053 --> 01:31:35,044
And now
the nation's attention...

1933
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:36,606
is focused on California...

1934
01:31:36,739 --> 01:31:38,297
with its last day
of heated campaigning...

1935
01:31:38,341 --> 01:31:39,706
before going to the polls
tomorrow.

1936
01:31:39,742 --> 01:31:41,607
In the Democratic
Senatorial race...

1937
01:31:41,644 --> 01:31:44,408
challenger Hugh Weldie began
campaigning early today...

1938
01:31:44,447 --> 01:31:45,880
in the San Joaquin Valley.

1939
01:31:45,915 --> 01:31:47,906
His opponent,
Senator Jay Bulworth...

1940
01:31:47,951 --> 01:31:50,010
is said to be meeting
with top advisors.

1941
01:31:50,053 --> 01:31:52,453
Call it
single payer or Canadian way

1942
01:31:52,488 --> 01:31:55,457
Only socialized medicine
will ever save the day

1943
01:31:55,491 --> 01:31:57,857
Come on now,
let me hear that dirty word

1944
01:31:57,894 --> 01:31:59,521
Socialism!

1945
01:31:59,562 --> 01:32:01,928
Where is
Senator Jay Bulworth?

1946
01:32:01,965 --> 01:32:03,899
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

1947
01:32:03,933 --> 01:32:05,867
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

1948
01:32:05,902 --> 01:32:08,370
As the Bulworth campaign
heads into its final moments...

1949
01:32:08,404 --> 01:32:09,735
before tomorrow's primary...

1950
01:32:09,772 --> 01:32:12,832
it appears to have decided to
keep its candidate under wraps.

1951
01:32:12,876 --> 01:32:14,241
The real obscenity

1952
01:32:14,277 --> 01:32:16,268
Black folks livin' with
every day

1953
01:32:16,312 --> 01:32:18,303
Is tryin' to believe
a mother word

1954
01:32:18,348 --> 01:32:20,009
Democrats and Republicans say

1955
01:32:20,049 --> 01:32:21,778
Obscenity?

1956
01:32:21,818 --> 01:32:23,752
I'm Jay Billington Bulworth

1957
01:32:23,786 --> 01:32:24,912
Call the police?

1958
01:32:24,954 --> 01:32:27,047
Think an APB
on the Senator election night...

1959
01:32:27,090 --> 01:32:28,921
is the kind of press
we're looking for?

1960
01:32:28,958 --> 01:32:31,085
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

1961
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:32,890
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

1962
01:32:32,929 --> 01:32:34,760
Where is Senator Jay Bulworth?

1963
01:32:34,797 --> 01:32:36,822
That's the question
everybody is asking...

1964
01:32:36,866 --> 01:32:37,992
this election day
after the Senator...

1965
01:32:38,034 --> 01:32:41,595
astonished the political
establishment yesterday...

1966
01:32:41,638 --> 01:32:43,196
by making no appearances.

1967
01:32:43,239 --> 01:32:45,799
Bulworth Campaign Chief
Dennis Murphy said...

1968
01:32:45,842 --> 01:32:47,571
the Senator was behind
closed doors...

1969
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:50,511
and would probably meet
with the press later today.

1970
01:32:50,546 --> 01:32:53,014
Good evening.
It's California primary night.

1971
01:32:53,049 --> 01:32:54,209
The polls have closed...

1972
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:56,150
and nobody's seen
anything quite like it.

1973
01:32:56,185 --> 01:32:58,244
The big surprise
is Senator Jay Bulworth.

1974
01:32:58,288 --> 01:33:00,017
Bulworth appears
not only to have won...

1975
01:33:00,056 --> 01:33:02,115
the Democratic
Senatorial nomination...

1976
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:04,490
with a whopping 71%
of the vote...

1977
01:33:04,527 --> 01:33:07,087
he's received 15%
of the Democratic vote...

1978
01:33:07,130 --> 01:33:10,691
and 8% of the Republican vote
as a write-in for president.

1979
01:33:10,733 --> 01:33:12,894
Bear in mind, Bulworth
has never expressed interest...

1980
01:33:12,936 --> 01:33:14,164
in running for president.

1981
01:33:14,203 --> 01:33:16,535
Political analysts from
the Bay Area to the Beltway...

1982
01:33:16,572 --> 01:33:18,233
are scratching
their heads in wonder...

1983
01:33:18,274 --> 01:33:20,936
over this unprecedented
turn of events.

1984
01:33:20,977 --> 01:33:22,342
No, Nina's no idiot.

1985
01:33:22,378 --> 01:33:23,675
If she was tryin'
to hide the Senator...

1986
01:33:23,713 --> 01:33:24,941
then she'd just--

1987
01:33:26,616 --> 01:33:30,017
What? If she were gonna hide
the Senator, what?

1988
01:33:33,323 --> 01:33:35,314
- Is he still sleepin'?
- Still sleepin'.

1989
01:33:35,358 --> 01:33:38,589
...into the house
and find out if he is here.

1990
01:33:38,628 --> 01:33:42,155
Feldman. Feldman.

1991
01:33:43,599 --> 01:33:45,624
Now, this is
a most unusual situation.

1992
01:33:45,668 --> 01:33:48,296
Hey, L.D.

1993
01:33:48,338 --> 01:33:49,635
You got customers, man.

1994
01:33:49,672 --> 01:33:51,071
Nobody seems to have seen him.

1995
01:33:51,107 --> 01:33:53,268
L.D., man, come on.

1996
01:33:53,309 --> 01:33:57,609
Ahem. What's up?

1997
01:33:57,647 --> 01:34:00,377
The house
looks good, Momma Doll.

1998
01:34:01,584 --> 01:34:02,676
They can't see the flowers.

1999
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:04,619
Can't show 'em in a close-up.

2000
01:34:04,654 --> 01:34:06,315
Why don't they show
my flowers?

2001
01:34:06,356 --> 01:34:08,722
Hey, man, um...

2002
01:34:08,758 --> 01:34:11,192
it's very important that I speak
with Senator Bulworth, sir.

2003
01:34:11,227 --> 01:34:12,353
Is--is he here?

2004
01:34:12,395 --> 01:34:14,226
Would you mind
waiting in the street?

2005
01:34:14,263 --> 01:34:17,323
I--I can't wait in the street.
Um, uh, I'm totally cool.

2006
01:34:17,367 --> 01:34:18,925
I'm the Senator's
chief of staff.

2007
01:34:18,968 --> 01:34:20,731
I'm not a member of the press,
and so--

2008
01:34:20,770 --> 01:34:22,738
Momma Doll said
don't mess up her flowers.

2009
01:34:22,772 --> 01:34:26,173
Seems to be an impromptu powwow.

2010
01:34:26,209 --> 01:34:27,836
Maybe we can get
some information.

2011
01:34:27,877 --> 01:34:30,710
You know when we might expect
a statement from the Senator?

2012
01:34:30,747 --> 01:34:32,009
Very, very shortly,
I promise you.

2013
01:34:32,048 --> 01:34:35,074
Murphy, Murphy.
It is worse than arrogance.

2014
01:34:35,118 --> 01:34:37,109
It's contempt.
It's contempt for the press.

2015
01:34:37,153 --> 01:34:39,849
He's been missing two days.
Who do we call, Robert Stack?

2016
01:34:39,889 --> 01:34:42,187
What possible explanation
could possibly satisfy me?

2017
01:34:42,225 --> 01:34:43,749
None. Is he in that house?

2018
01:34:43,793 --> 01:34:45,420
Uh-oh, think we got a problem.

2019
01:34:45,461 --> 01:34:47,759
He still sleepin'?

2020
01:34:47,797 --> 01:34:49,128
The group
of Bulworth Democrats...

2021
01:34:49,165 --> 01:34:50,462
agreed on one thing--

2022
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:52,092
Leading is more important
than winning.

2023
01:34:52,135 --> 01:34:54,103
Jonathan,
if you'd pan over here...

2024
01:34:54,137 --> 01:34:55,661
Just sit tight.

2025
01:34:55,705 --> 01:34:58,265
Clearly
everyone is tight-lipped here.

2026
01:34:58,307 --> 01:35:01,299
It's still a mystery as to
what is going on in this house.

2027
01:35:01,344 --> 01:35:02,675
We are in South Central
Los Angeles.

2028
01:35:02,712 --> 01:35:03,770
What's up, L.D.?

2029
01:35:03,813 --> 01:35:05,872
This brother owes me money.

2030
01:35:05,915 --> 01:35:08,315
- You gonna get your money.
- I don't want it no more.

2031
01:35:08,351 --> 01:35:10,683
- What?
- He don't want the money.

2032
01:35:10,720 --> 01:35:12,051
Look at me, D.

2033
01:35:13,990 --> 01:35:16,891
Look at me, brother.

2034
01:35:16,926 --> 01:35:18,484
You gonna work it off.

2035
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:21,656
Work it off?
What's he gonna be doin'?

2036
01:35:21,697 --> 01:35:23,722
We got some things
we need to do...

2037
01:35:23,766 --> 01:35:25,358
and you're gonna
help me do 'em.

2038
01:35:25,401 --> 01:35:29,531
And if you don't help me do 'em,
Darnell...

2039
01:35:29,572 --> 01:35:30,732
Come here, Snag.

2040
01:35:30,773 --> 01:35:32,934
Look here,
I got a reputation to protect...

2041
01:35:32,975 --> 01:35:34,101
you understand that?

2042
01:35:34,143 --> 01:35:36,270
So you're gonna have to wear
these casts right here.

2043
01:35:36,312 --> 01:35:38,405
And you got a choice
whether we break your legs.

2044
01:35:38,448 --> 01:35:39,710
Now if you're down with us...

2045
01:35:39,749 --> 01:35:41,842
we'll let you wear them casts
without breakin' your legs.

2046
01:35:41,884 --> 01:35:44,512
'Cause I'm gonna flip this whole
power shit a different way.

2047
01:35:44,554 --> 01:35:46,522
And for the sake of your pretty
little daughter right here...

2048
01:35:46,556 --> 01:35:47,716
I hope you make--

2049
01:35:47,757 --> 01:35:50,487
In recent days
he has not been seen.

2050
01:35:50,526 --> 01:35:52,460
This is one of the biggest days
of his political life.

2051
01:35:52,495 --> 01:35:54,963
- Hi.
- Hi.

2052
01:35:54,997 --> 01:35:56,259
Good sleep?

2053
01:35:56,299 --> 01:35:58,426
Yes, I had a very good sleep,
thank you.

2054
01:35:58,468 --> 01:36:00,595
It's good to see you.
How are you? Good to see you.

2055
01:36:00,636 --> 01:36:02,604
- How you doin', Senator?
- Very well, thank you.

2056
01:36:02,638 --> 01:36:05,232
You got a very comfortable
guest room out there.

2057
01:36:05,274 --> 01:36:07,742
You've been very kind.
Good to see you.

2058
01:36:07,777 --> 01:36:08,937
They been talkin'
about you on TV.

2059
01:36:08,978 --> 01:36:12,209
Have they? Could I borrow
the telephone a second?

2060
01:36:12,248 --> 01:36:13,772
Think I'm late
at my headquarters.

2061
01:36:13,816 --> 01:36:17,274
- Oh, sure.
- I can't thank you enough.

2062
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,753
I only hope I can reciprocate.

2063
01:36:18,788 --> 01:36:21,621
You wanna stay
for supper? We got kale.

2064
01:36:21,657 --> 01:36:24,125
He likes
collard greens, not kale.

2065
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:25,491
He like kale.

2066
01:36:25,528 --> 01:36:27,359
He thinks
they're collard greens.

2067
01:36:27,396 --> 01:36:29,227
Hey, Senator,
congratulations.

2068
01:36:29,265 --> 01:36:33,201
Oh, hey, we met not that
long ago at your office.

2069
01:36:33,236 --> 01:36:34,669
Yeah, at my office.

2070
01:36:34,704 --> 01:36:36,672
- Good to see you, I--
- Senator?

2071
01:36:36,706 --> 01:36:39,607
Senator Bulworth?
Is this great? This is great.

2072
01:36:39,642 --> 01:36:42,634
Congratula--
What are you wearing, sir?

2073
01:36:42,678 --> 01:36:44,612
- What do you mean?
- Get into the old clothes.

2074
01:36:44,647 --> 01:36:46,205
The numbers on this thing
are astounding.

2075
01:36:46,249 --> 01:36:49,446
- The clothes are part of it.
- I don't think so.

2076
01:36:49,485 --> 01:36:51,817
Not just the clothes.
But they're a part.

2077
01:36:51,854 --> 01:36:54,448
I have a 14-state strategy
where you run as an independent.

2078
01:36:54,490 --> 01:36:57,015
Have you seen
the Senator this evening?

2079
01:36:57,059 --> 01:37:00,688
We got to take advantage
of this crazy motherfucker.

2080
01:37:00,730 --> 01:37:02,698
You gotta decide now.

2081
01:37:02,732 --> 01:37:04,723
- You with it?
- I'm down.

2082
01:37:04,767 --> 01:37:06,257
They can take that two ways.

2083
01:37:06,302 --> 01:37:08,634
Aah!

2084
01:37:08,671 --> 01:37:10,002
How 'bout that write-in vote?

2085
01:37:10,039 --> 01:37:12,940
Are we runnin' for president
or what?

2086
01:37:12,975 --> 01:37:15,637
You're my nigger!
You won! I love you.

2087
01:37:15,678 --> 01:37:18,670
I love you right now
so much, I swear to God.

2088
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:19,840
Don't swear.

2089
01:37:19,882 --> 01:37:21,747
I'm mean, you know...

2090
01:37:21,784 --> 01:37:23,274
Plant that thought
in their heads.

2091
01:37:23,319 --> 01:37:24,843
If we take the Santa Monica...

2092
01:37:24,887 --> 01:37:27,082
we'll be at the Beverly Wilshire
in 23 minutes, make "Nightline."

2093
01:37:27,123 --> 01:37:29,091
- Olympic's better.
- It is not better.

2094
01:37:29,125 --> 01:37:31,559
We're taking
Santa Monica and dump the limo.

2095
01:37:31,594 --> 01:37:33,562
- Find an old car.
- The limo's paid for.

2096
01:37:33,596 --> 01:37:35,723
- We're an insurgent campaign.
- I've got a taxi outside.

2097
01:37:35,765 --> 01:37:36,891
Taxi's a good idea.

2098
01:37:36,933 --> 01:37:39,128
Yo, your boy Macavoy
really been lookin' out for you.

2099
01:37:39,168 --> 01:37:41,762
Oh, man of the hour! Ha ha.

2100
01:37:41,804 --> 01:37:43,965
- How are you feelin'?
- Pretty good, thanks.

2101
01:37:44,006 --> 01:37:45,530
You're back
in the chips, Senator.

2102
01:37:45,575 --> 01:37:46,769
You moron.

2103
01:37:46,809 --> 01:37:48,504
Come on, they're waitin' for us.

2104
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,943
Sir, Senator, um...

2105
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:53,142
when you get outside,
I think you just say, um--

2106
01:37:53,182 --> 01:37:56,345
Oh, Bulworth is the man!

2107
01:37:56,385 --> 01:37:58,285
Oh, Bulworth is the man!

2108
01:37:58,321 --> 01:38:01,051
Just say,
"Our fight is just beginning."

2109
01:38:01,090 --> 01:38:04,218
A couple questions,
then off to the hotel.

2110
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:05,887
I'm a Bulworth Democrat, too.

2111
01:38:09,031 --> 01:38:10,999
Are you comin' or not?

2112
01:38:11,033 --> 01:38:12,159
Really an important day...

2113
01:38:12,201 --> 01:38:14,362
in the political life
of Senator Bulworth.

2114
01:38:14,403 --> 01:38:16,371
Senator Bulworth
will be out momentarily.

2115
01:38:16,405 --> 01:38:18,669
He will make a brief statement
and then take your questions.

2116
01:38:20,409 --> 01:38:22,707
Victory speech.
We'll see Bulworth's reaction...

2117
01:38:22,745 --> 01:38:24,804
to this incredible
primary election.

2118
01:38:24,847 --> 01:38:27,543
We naturally would
like to know...

2119
01:38:27,583 --> 01:38:28,845
what his response is.

2120
01:38:28,884 --> 01:38:32,149
This was an overwhelming
margin of victory.

2121
01:38:32,188 --> 01:38:35,248
Is there an explanation
for his erratic behavior...

2122
01:38:35,291 --> 01:38:38,480
in the last few days?

2123
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:41,241
Murphy. Murphy.

2124
01:39:01,403 --> 01:39:04,702
Senator Bulworth,
have you committed adultery?

2125
01:39:06,074 --> 01:39:08,440
Have you been
able to get airtime, Senator?

2126
01:39:12,681 --> 01:39:14,171
Yo, Nina!

2127
01:39:25,727 --> 01:39:27,661
Why you lookin' like you
never seen this before?

2128
01:39:33,335 --> 01:39:35,895
Let me ask you--
why did you do that?

2129
01:39:35,937 --> 01:39:37,495
- Do what?
- You just sat there.

2130
01:39:37,539 --> 01:39:39,268
What was I supposed to do?

2131
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:42,003
You just sat, and you made me
feel insecure.

2132
01:39:42,043 --> 01:39:44,204
- I made you feel insecure?
- Of course.

2133
01:39:44,246 --> 01:39:46,544
- Why'd I make you feel insecure?
- Are you kidding?

2134
01:39:46,581 --> 01:39:48,014
First, I'm too old for you.

2135
01:39:48,049 --> 01:39:50,984
- And, also, you know, I--
- And what?

2136
01:39:51,019 --> 01:39:53,010
- I'm white.
- You're white?

2137
01:39:53,054 --> 01:39:54,214
Yeah.

2138
01:39:54,256 --> 01:39:55,746
You're insecure
'cause you're white?

2139
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:57,224
Yes. You just sat there.

2140
01:39:57,259 --> 01:39:59,227
Oh, come on, Bulworth.

2141
01:40:00,428 --> 01:40:02,225
You know you're my nigger.

2142
01:40:12,707 --> 01:40:14,834
Ah, baby!

2143
01:40:16,678 --> 01:40:19,909
For my man see
on the inside the outside.

2144
01:40:23,251 --> 01:40:24,775
The party's gettin' rough...

2145
01:40:24,820 --> 01:40:27,755
and I'm goin' home
soon as I find my panties.

2146
01:41:08,296 --> 01:41:10,628
Stay in the car, Nina.

2147
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:14,226
Snag, come here, man. Get back.
Stay in the car, Nina.

2148
01:41:15,237 --> 01:41:17,034
Where'd that shot
come from, man?

2149
01:41:23,345 --> 01:41:24,937
A fuckin' holiday

2150
01:41:24,980 --> 01:41:27,608
Every day is a holiday

2151
01:41:27,649 --> 01:41:30,675
Another motherfuckin' dollar day

2152
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:32,050
Every day is a holiday

2153
01:41:32,087 --> 01:41:33,213
Holiday

2154
01:41:33,255 --> 01:41:35,746
Another motherfuckin' dollar day

2155
01:41:35,790 --> 01:41:37,951
Every day is a holiday

2156
01:41:37,993 --> 01:41:41,656
Another motherfuckin' dollar day

2157
01:41:41,696 --> 01:41:42,822
Hold on!

2158
01:41:42,864 --> 01:41:45,662
We don't need no more ghosts.
We need a song.

2159
01:41:45,700 --> 01:41:48,168
You got to sing, Bulworth.

2160
01:41:48,203 --> 01:41:49,363
You can't be no ghost.

2161
01:41:49,404 --> 01:41:51,565
But you got to be a spirit,
Bulworth.

2162
01:41:51,606 --> 01:41:53,073
You got to be a spirit!

2163
01:41:53,108 --> 01:41:57,272
And the spirit will not descend
without song.

2164
01:41:57,312 --> 01:42:00,679
We need a spirit, Bulworth...

2165
01:42:00,715 --> 01:42:06,210
not a ghost! Not a ghost!

2166
01:42:06,254 --> 01:42:09,917
Come on, Bulworth.

2167
01:42:24,673 --> 01:42:28,609
You got to be a spirit.

2168
01:42:28,643 --> 01:42:30,577
You can't be no ghost.

2169
01:43:42,790 --> 01:43:44,155
Y'all deaf, dumb, and blind

2170
01:43:44,192 --> 01:43:45,523
Before the whites got us all

2171
01:43:45,560 --> 01:43:46,891
Into white collar crime

2172
01:43:46,928 --> 01:43:48,725
Behind suits and clean shaves

2173
01:43:48,763 --> 01:43:50,390
I can use and abuse 'em

2174
01:43:50,431 --> 01:43:51,898
Choose 'em as slaves

2175
01:43:51,933 --> 01:43:55,027
I see jobs as plantations

2176
01:43:55,069 --> 01:43:56,593
I robbed the damn nations

2177
01:43:56,638 --> 01:43:57,969
So I can live in luxury

2178
01:43:58,006 --> 01:44:00,440
You fucks with me,
you buried in the dirt

2179
01:44:00,475 --> 01:44:03,876
And I'm gonna throw
in the tux for free

2180
01:44:03,912 --> 01:44:06,403
It's insane what's in there,
can't get enough said

2181
01:44:06,447 --> 01:44:08,779
Action's on
and we get jail from that

2182
01:44:08,816 --> 01:44:11,751
But on the way down
from the depths of hell

2183
01:44:11,786 --> 01:44:14,118
You gonna meet in the grass,
oh, it's psycho black

2184
01:44:14,155 --> 01:44:16,715
Like my nigger Jack Frost

2185
01:44:16,758 --> 01:44:18,851
My eyes is sore
from bein' a senator

2186
01:44:18,893 --> 01:44:21,327
Behind closed doors,
hittin' truth to the sea floor

2187
01:44:21,362 --> 01:44:23,592
The rich go north,
ignore the tug of war

2188
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:26,327
While the kids are poor,
open new and better drug stores

2189
01:44:26,367 --> 01:44:29,063
So I became hard-core,
couldn't take it no more

2190
01:44:29,103 --> 01:44:31,469
I'm gonna reveal everything,
change the law

2191
01:44:31,506 --> 01:44:33,440
I find myself
walkin' the streets

2192
01:44:33,474 --> 01:44:35,567
Trying to find
what's really goin' on

2193
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:37,043
Ghetto superstar

2194
01:44:37,078 --> 01:44:39,603
That is what you are

2195
01:44:39,647 --> 01:44:41,740
Comin' from afar

2196
01:44:41,783 --> 01:44:44,081
Reachin' for the stars

2197
01:44:44,118 --> 01:44:46,985
Run away with me

2198
01:44:47,021 --> 01:44:48,921
To another place

2199
01:44:48,957 --> 01:44:51,949
We can rely on each other

2200
01:44:51,993 --> 01:44:54,120
Uh-huh

2201
01:44:54,162 --> 01:44:56,892
From one corner to another

2202
01:44:56,931 --> 01:44:58,922
Uh-huh

2203
01:45:53,688 --> 01:45:55,656
How come, How come

2204
01:46:32,026 --> 01:46:34,153
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

2205
01:46:34,195 --> 01:46:36,322
- Kill
- Kill 'em live

2206
01:46:36,364 --> 01:46:39,265
My man hits the body,
busting caps and hardly misses

2207
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:41,063
Call the taxi

2208
01:46:41,102 --> 01:46:44,265
Makin' sure that it records ya
for my midnight plane to Georgia

2209
01:46:44,305 --> 01:46:45,772
Agent double-O player

2210
01:46:45,807 --> 01:46:47,274
The life giver

2211
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:48,570
The name William

2212
01:46:48,609 --> 01:46:51,100
Propaganda can't gas
the last man standin'

2213
01:46:51,145 --> 01:46:52,840
Assassinate all the planet

2214
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:54,780
Get wrecked,
what you see is what you get

2215
01:46:54,816 --> 01:46:56,750
More stars to truck

2216
01:46:56,784 --> 01:46:59,082
21st-century Robin Hood

2217
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:00,781
Against the politics
of robbin' 'hoods

2218
01:47:00,822 --> 01:47:03,154
Fought the government
'cause you know that I would

2219
01:47:03,191 --> 01:47:05,557
The FBI's up to no good

2220
01:47:05,593 --> 01:47:06,924
And power to the people
