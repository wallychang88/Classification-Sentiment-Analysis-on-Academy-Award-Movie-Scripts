1
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:42,351
- Name?
- Karen Silkwood.

2
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,645
- Drew Stephens.
- Dolly Pelliker.

3
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,585
Hi, Ham.

4
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,935
- Good-bye.
- All right.

5
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,197
All right, see you.

6
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,390
So then the woman got up...

7
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:06,310
and she was dressed
in a long white dress...

8
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,811
just like an angel.

9
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,898
And she called for the people
to come on up...

10
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,485
and this kid came up
with an arm...

11
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:18,530
that was almost pitch black
from blood poisoning.

12
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:21,158
But that woman held that arm...

13
00:03:21,242 --> 00:03:23,202
and she prayed over it...

14
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,496
and it turned pink
right in front of your eyes.

15
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,583
And then it fell right off.

16
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,752
I was there, Wesley.

17
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,795
I was sitting right there.

18
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:37,299
When I was in the service,
I saw this gook...

19
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,426
drink a glass of milk
through his pecker.

20
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:45,766
What? Then what happened?

21
00:03:45,808 --> 00:03:47,935
Didn't follow him home
to find out.

22
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,145
This is dry processing...

23
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,980
the heart of
the production process.

24
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,357
Come on in, trainees.

25
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:57,986
This brown powder
you see here. ..

26
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,989
is mixed plutonium
and uranium oxide.

27
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,950
And these trained technicians...

28
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,953
are fabricating it
into fuel pellets.

29
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,120
Karen, could you explain...

30
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,914
the procedures
in this glove box?

31
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,168
Yeah. what we're doing is
we're blending and mixing...

32
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:16,964
the plutonium and uranium oxide
into correct ratios.

33
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,466
And then we sift it
for impurities.

34
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,469
And then it's fed
into the slugging press...

35
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:24,471
which makes the pellets.

36
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,598
This is the slugging press...

37
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:29,476
where the powder
is turned into pellets.

38
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:33,480
What about radiation effects
from all this material?

39
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,691
We've all seen a poor guy...

40
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,484
suffering
the effects of sunburn.

41
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,611
Radiation is like that.

42
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:41,488
It's the kind of thing
that can't hurt you...

43
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,490
unless you're careless with it.

44
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,622
Hey, Wesley?

45
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:54,209
Come here. I need the help
of a trained technician here.

46
00:04:56,337 --> 00:04:57,879
Come here.

47
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,342
Put it back in!

48
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:08,890
Hey, Georgie. You know
that 0' girl Jeane Dixon...

49
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,642
the one with the stars
on her palms?

50
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,853
She was on Johnny Carson
one night. ..

51
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,105
and she's telling
how her niece phoned her up.

52
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:18,734
Niece goes, "I got to catch
this airplane to Houston."

53
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,277
And Jeane Dixon goes...

54
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,070
"Now, don't you get on
that airplane."

55
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,072
And by golly,
that airplane crashed.

56
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,282
What do you make of that?

57
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,367
She's got the gift, all right.

58
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,411
Or maybe she just
tells everybody she knows...

59
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,496
not to get on planes,
and then one day...

60
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,540
one crashes
and that's her lucky day.

61
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,292
Drew says he's got
to work an hour overtime. ..

62
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,668
so he can't leave till 7:00.

63
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:39,087
OK. Shit!
I forgot to get permission.

64
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,257
I don't know.
I believe in that stuff.

65
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,301
Sometimes it happens
where I know things.

66
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,803
Can you tell if
I'm getting this weekend off?

67
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,431
- Go see my kids?
- It don't work like that.

68
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:53,685
I can't sit here
and find out just anything.

69
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,230
I have to wait for it
to smack into me.

70
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,816
- Lunch!
- I got to find Hurley.

71
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,277
Karen,
you never monitor yourself.

72
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,612
Come back here
and do it like the rest of us.

73
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,197
"Karen,
you never monitor yourself."

74
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,615
I'll get you, girl.

75
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:09,659
Know what happens to girls
that don't monitor themselves?

76
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,620
Your nipples turn green.

77
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,756
There's nothing they can do.

78
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,716
Where they going to park
a contaminated truck?

79
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,718
It'll stay that way
twenty-five thousand years.

80
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,471
They can put it in space.
Hell, put it in orbit.

81
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,890
- Yeah, in orbit.
- Put it on the moon.

82
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,101
- What's going on?
- They cooked a truck.

83
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,519
There was a leak
in one of the barrels.

84
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,770
Dolly tell you
I have to work late?

85
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,481
Yeah.
The whole weekend's screwed up.

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:43,068
I forgot to get permission.
Now I can't find Hurley.

87
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:44,319
You better find him.

88
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,822
Heard those guys on the truck
didn't monitor themselves.

89
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,365
That's a surprise.

90
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:53,703
- New guy in X-ray.
- See y'all later.

91
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,956
- What's his name?
- OK. Take care.

92
00:06:55,957 --> 00:07:00,001
Winston something.
Do you like him?

93
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,130
As a matter of fact,
he's the type I hate.

94
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,674
Curtis, what is that?

95
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,093
Gilda's got some recipe
from a magazine...

96
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:11,179
about putting pineapple
in everything.

97
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:13,181
She puts pineapple in pineapple.

98
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,353
What you got?

99
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,939
What do you want?

100
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,985
- Mystery meat.
- It's no mystery.

101
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,661
What's that?
Peanut butter again?

102
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,705
Lay off my sandwich.

103
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,542
I don't want that.

104
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:44,212
- Hey, Thelma.
- Hi, honey.

105
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,547
How's your daughter doing?

106
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,550
She's had
one of them remissions.

107
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,052
If you believe in them.

108
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:53,472
Thank the Lord I got six others.

109
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,353
Mr. Hurley?

110
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,980
I hear you want the weekend off.

111
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,191
- I know it's late.
- we can't give it to you.

112
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,151
This plant's operating
24 hours a day on a deadline.

113
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,153
- You know that.
- Yeah.

114
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:10,655
How about if I get somebody
to switch with me?

115
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,908
Most people are working
a double shift now.

116
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:20,040
So, anyway...

117
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,544
don't everybody
volunteer at once.

118
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,049
We have a revival, Karen.

119
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,513
And you?

120
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,766
Jimmy and me are going
to Oklahoma City for a concert.

121
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,854
Curtis would have a fit.

122
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,487
Promised my kid
I'd take him to Gar Creek.

123
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,663
How about you, Carl?

124
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,498
I got to work myself.

125
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,712
- what the hell was that?
- It's a test.

126
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,172
How do you know?

127
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:13,885
This is a test.
This is only a test.

128
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:15,470
You always say that.

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,515
You know some poor son
of a bitch got his ass fried.

130
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,475
What I don't get is
how we have all these tests...

131
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,102
but never go through the drill.

132
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,895
If this was a real
airborne contamination...

133
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:25,689
we're supposed
to get out of here.

134
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,607
We can't do the drill.

135
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:30,860
It might stop production
for ten minutes.

136
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,321
If it had been the real thing,
they'd shut down the plant...

137
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,824
and I could have had
the whole weekend.

138
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:45,292
Karen, I've been thinking.

139
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:48,295
If you'll work
the next shift back-to-back. ..

140
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,589
I'll switch with you.

141
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,509
Don't tell Curtis, hear?

142
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,344
You mean Curtis
still doesn't like me?

143
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,430
No, but you know how he is.

144
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,941
What are they doing
to that truck?

145
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,610
Move on out, OK?

146
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,503
Dolly.

147
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,214
You coming, or aren't you?

148
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,100
What's there to do down there?

149
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:10,478
Nothing. There's nothing
to do down there.

150
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,480
All right. I'll come.

151
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,608
She's coming!

152
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:20,864
It's not going to be a party,
so don't blame me.

153
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:07,202
It stinks around here.

154
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:11,247
That's home. That's what I left.

155
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,177
They'll be back
in a little while.

156
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,346
Just went to get some beer.

157
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,441
This is great, Linda.

158
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,035
Come on. Come on in.

159
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,041
Oh, boy.

160
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:58,419
You look so big.

161
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,922
Go on. Say hi to your mama.

162
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:04,092
Donny, come here.

163
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,511
Denise, Donny,
come sit over here.

164
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,930
Donny? Donny, come.

165
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,265
It's OK, son. Go ahead.

166
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,852
That's such a pretty dress.

167
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:16,104
I know. Linda made it for me.

168
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,525
Did you get that baseball
I sent you?

169
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,402
You all remember Drew?

170
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:29,868
- I'm so happy to see you.
- where were you, Mama?

171
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,160
I was up near Oklahoma City.
I told you that.

172
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,163
- Are you Mama?
- I'm Mama. That's right.

173
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,541
Mama's going to take you
to the beach for the weekend.

174
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,042
Am I going?

175
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,837
You're going,
and we'll stay in a motel. ..

176
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:43,214
and get those little pieces
of soap all wrapped up.. .

177
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:44,799
You should have talked to me.

178
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:48,511
I got the weekend off.
I'm taking them out to Daddy's.

179
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,015
I talked to Linda.

180
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,058
You should have talked to me.

181
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,651
You can take them out
for a while if you want to.

182
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,159
Scoot through.

183
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,078
What am I supposed to eat here?

184
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:16,372
- French fries.
- Shit.

185
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,083
Don't say that, Dolly.

186
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,882
Donny,
you're not eating anything.

187
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,469
- I've got to use the bathroom.
- Go ahead.

188
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,054
Mom, can I buy a coke?

189
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,142
OK. Here you go.

190
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,274
Drew, you help Tammy.
Nobody'll see her up there.

191
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,327
- I couldn't go.
- You couldn't go.

192
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,876
Do you still sleep with Mama?

193
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,213
Shit!

194
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,215
Don't say that, Mama.

195
00:16:07,257 --> 00:16:09,258
Don't drip it in my fries!

196
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:17,517
Old McDonald had a farm.

197
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,811
E-I-E-I-O

198
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,354
Yeah, here we are.

199
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,940
All right, Tammy,
don't forget your moose.

200
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:30,029
Drew, help me get her out
of the back seat, will you?

201
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:33,533
One, two, three!

202
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,034
Good girl!

203
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,246
What you got?

204
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:43,501
Kiss your mama. That a girl.

205
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,170
I don't want to!

206
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,340
I'll see you next month.

207
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,758
Take them in.

208
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,137
Pete, did you give her
our new address?

209
00:16:56,557 --> 00:17:01,853
All I know is Midland, Texas,
care of the company.

210
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,980
- Midland?
- Yeah.

211
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,482
Big strike near
the New Mexico border.

212
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,919
I just can't picture it.

213
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,589
What?

214
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,634
How long were you
married to him?

215
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,472
You want to hear
something funny?

216
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,307
How about some for the back?

217
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,481
We ran off to get married.

218
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:50,735
We heard you could get a license
in Louisiana under-age.

219
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,112
But we couldn't,
so we came home...

220
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,115
we told everybody
we got married.

221
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,368
And we never did.

222
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,287
I thought you were divorced.

223
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,835
We're divorced, all right.

224
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,714
How come you got divorced
if you never got married?

225
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,800
Common law.

226
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:19,972
Goddamn government
fucks you coming and going.

227
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:35,530
Amazing grace.

228
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:41,035
How sweet the sound.

229
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,038
That saved.

230
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:52,088
A wretch like me

231
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:57,176
I once was lost.

232
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:03,099
But now I'm found.

233
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,935
Was bound.

234
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:13,985
But now I'm free.

235
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,539
I had them in the car.

236
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,375
I could have just headed
straight for Oklahoma.

237
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,256
What would you
have done with them?

238
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,890
I don't know.

239
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:10,833
Hey, Karen?

240
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,130
Joe... from the concert.

241
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,550
Hi. What you doing?

242
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:24,347
We did a job out here
the other night, buried a truck.

243
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,973
Sure you did.

244
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,808
Yeah. We had a hot truck.

245
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,810
We chopped it up, put it
in these little baggies...

246
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,020
and they sent it off
to be buried.

247
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,190
Friday night? Yeah, I saw that.

248
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:37,652
Some bozo was here
barking at everybody.

249
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:38,945
See you.

250
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,364
What did he want?

251
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:43,407
He's a friend of Wesley's.

252
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,082
My windshield wipers broke.

253
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,794
You think you could ask Drew
to take a look at it?

254
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:59,465
He's got two cars ahead of you,
but I'll ask him.

255
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:02,301
Thelma,
your hair looks different.

256
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,805
I gave my daughter my good wig.
Her hair is falling out.

257
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,807
They give her them treatments.

258
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:14,313
Do you know they're making
my daughter die...

259
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,857
next to a colored person?

260
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,029
Come here. Go like that.

261
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,907
There.

262
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,034
I like your hair
that color, Thelma.

263
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,079
But this here is my bad wig.

264
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,248
It ain't human hair or nothing.

265
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,337
You and Drew
ought to settle down.

266
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,507
Stop people talking about us.

267
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,635
I don't care about that stuff.

268
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,346
- What stuff?
- The pot.

269
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:50,224
Yeah. The pot.

270
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,852
And the kind of sex.

271
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,566
The kind of sex.

272
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,532
Oh, God.

273
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,075
Gilda, how did it go?

274
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:14,749
We had to go to my
mother-in-law's after church.

275
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,876
She served up this casserole...

276
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:19,503
that she'd been
slow cooking for three days.

277
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,923
We've both been
up sick all night.

278
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:25,885
You were supposed
to work my shift yesterday!

279
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:30,014
Karen, they shut down.

280
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,933
Say what?

281
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,269
There was a contamination
in our section.

282
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,272
When?

283
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,316
Right after you left.

284
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,238
Karen, I'm not saying this
to upset you...

285
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:49,450
but you ought to know
they're saying that you did it.

286
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,745
I did it?

287
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,830
They knew you wanted
the weekend off.

288
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,791
Gilda, that is so dumb.

289
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,834
I know.

290
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,960
I hope you enjoyed
your weekend, Karen.

291
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,047
Shit!

292
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:55,099
Monitor yourself on the way out.

293
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:20,040
Did you hear about this thing?

294
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,586
Why don't we talk
about it at lunch?

295
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,297
I hate people
talking about me that way.

296
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,633
Then quit and
live on your savings.

297
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,553
Somebody contaminated
your section.

298
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,930
Why would anybody
think I did it?

299
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,600
Whoever did, it wasn't funny.

300
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,435
I brung your plastic, Drew.

301
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,853
Thanks, Zachary.

302
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,772
You could have done it
a lot easier than I could've.

303
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:46,108
Anybody could have done it.

304
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,735
Well, it wasn't me!

305
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,362
Here's Quincy.
Here's the head of the union.

306
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,740
Talk to him. The union
will get you out of this.

307
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,241
Yeah, sure, OK.

308
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,035
The company has
got to blame somebody.. .

309
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:57,411
otherwise, it's their fault.

310
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:02,291
What are you looking at,
Zachary?

311
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,086
Get lost, OK?

312
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:11,467
Karen, you ever thought
of going into politics?

313
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,881
I am really not interested.

314
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,592
Come on. Try Karen.

315
00:25:55,262 --> 00:25:56,845
Asshole.

316
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,772
No! I'm scared!

317
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,775
I'm scared!
I don't want to die. No!

318
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,903
Just stay calm. Come on.

319
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,333
Thelma's cooked.

320
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,295
I said Thelma is cooked.

321
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,963
Shit.

322
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,384
Did they take her
down to decon yet?

323
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,635
I think so.

324
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:49,023
- You can't go in there.
- Come on, Earl!

325
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,358
Karen! Get on out of there!

326
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,277
She wants me here.

327
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,989
Oh, God!

328
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,491
This is just to take off
the contamination.

329
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,161
I was doing a transfer...

330
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,288
and they must have had
a leak in them!

331
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,584
When I went through
the check, I was hot!

332
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,046
The exposure that you got...

333
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,839
is under
the acceptable body burden.

334
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,884
I'm going to get cancer.
I'm going to die.

335
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,053
Now, Thelma.

336
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,471
I know something about this.

337
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,473
So does Earl know something.

338
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:25,392
What would he know? He's a vet.

339
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,227
That's what he was trained at!

340
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,482
Thelma, you're OK. There is
no internal contamination.

341
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,567
There's just a little
external contamination...

342
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,569
and we've taken care
of the problem.

343
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:42,034
Oh, my skin.

344
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,911
My skin hurts.

345
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:48,290
Honey, try not to cry.
Salt's going to make it worse.

346
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,221
Hell, you can make money
on any kind of place...

347
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,390
as long as it wasn't
too far from town.

348
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:07,267
There aren't that many mechanics
who know sports cars.

349
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,103
Where you gonna get the money?

350
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,438
Guess I'll have to sell my body.

351
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,440
I'll give you
five bucks for it...

352
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,235
but I'll think of it
as a charitable contribution.

353
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:17,861
That's beautiful.

354
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,780
What are you going to
call your place?

355
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,950
Drew's.

356
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,952
That's original.

357
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:26,954
What's your idea?

358
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,956
Lillian's.

359
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:32,418
Drew's Car Repair
and Live Bait Dealership.

360
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:35,462
Thought I'd keep a few worms
for a sideline.

361
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,090
Drew's Car Repair
and Live Bait Dealership.

362
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,134
Rolls right off your tongue.

363
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,184
What is this?

364
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,480
Spaghetti.

365
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,650
Yeah, I can see that.

366
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,446
You wrap this stuff
up in aluminum foil.

367
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,072
You don't even know what it is.

368
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,658
It sits in the refrigerator
and grows cooties.

369
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,452
One third of
the refrigerator is mine.

370
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,203
I can grow cooties if I want to.

371
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,456
When you do, one third
of the cooties is mine.

372
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:11,915
Dolly, look at the floor.

373
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:13,834
It's just seeds, Karen.

374
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,086
I don't care what it is!
I just cleaned up!

375
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,346
See you around the track.

376
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,607
Thelma says
she's going to get cancer.

377
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,192
If anybody's going to get
cancer around here...

378
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:41,737
it's going to be me,
Dolly Trashbags.

379
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,739
Everything isn't about you.

380
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,995
If anybody around here
is going to get cancer...

381
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,706
we're all going to get cancer.

382
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,885
How long have I been
at Kerr McGee?

383
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,807
Two years in October.

384
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:02,776
Thelma only got 24 DPMs.

385
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,030
Is that bad?

386
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,491
It's not super bad.

387
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:14,788
Are you just waking up to this?

388
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,791
You think we're working
with puffed wheat?

389
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,377
I'm just asking a question.

390
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,463
If you're really worried
about it, stop smoking.

391
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:30,095
Come on. Let's go to bed.

392
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,436
Let's go to bed.

393
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,483
You getting bored with it?

394
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,794
Come on.

395
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:40,040
Didn't you go to bed yet?

396
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:52,886
I'm sorry I yelled at you
last night.

397
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,233
I love you, Karen.

398
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,487
I love you, too.

399
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,366
I don't mean "I love you, too."

400
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,915
I know that's not what you mean.

401
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,460
That's what I mean.

402
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,088
We'd better go.

403
00:33:36,973 --> 00:33:39,349
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

404
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,734
I saw Thelma this morning.

405
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:50,402
Thelma hasn't had
her mind on her work...

406
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,404
since her daughter took sick.

407
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,574
It's terrible what they do
when they scrub a person.

408
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:59,327
I've been through it.
It ain't so bad.

409
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,789
Did she have just external,
or was it internal?

410
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,126
- Just external.
- They give her a nasal smear?

411
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,211
That's how they tell
about the internal.

412
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,130
No, I don't think so.

413
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,467
Shoot, I knew that!
Why didn't I think of that?

414
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:15,427
They should've given her
a nasal smear.

415
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,179
You can't think of everything.

416
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,639
Boy, they didn't even
give her a nasal smear!

417
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,642
- Why are you so interested?
- Huh?

418
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:25,562
Why are you so interested
all of a sudden?

419
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,193
Karen, I got one for you.

420
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,156
For as long as
anyone could remember...

421
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,116
this Indian chief
was in charge...

422
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,827
of naming all the children
that were born in the tribe.

423
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,831
One day, this brave
comes up to him and says...

424
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:47,584
"Chief, can I ask you something?"

425
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:49,586
"How do you name these children?"

426
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,422
"How do you
think of their names?"

427
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:55,509
And the chief says,
"It's very simple."

428
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,302
"When a child is born..."

429
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,805
"and I see
snow gently falling..."

430
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:04,518
"I say, you shall be called
Snow Gently Falling."

431
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,980
"And when a child is born
and I see a hawk flying over..."

432
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:13,235
"I say, you shall be named
Hawk Flying Over."

433
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,947
"But tell me, Two Dogs Fucking,
why are you so interested?"

434
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,252
That's terrible.

435
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,632
Thelma, did they give you
a nasal smear?

436
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,010
You make them
give you a nasal smear.

437
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,264
They're supposed to.
Make Hurley give you one.

438
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,683
And make him tell you the count!

439
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,685
And make sure
he's telling you the truth. ..

440
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,396
because there's
a lot of liars around here.

441
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,694
Nice going.

442
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,912
Happy birthday to you.

443
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,998
That's beautiful!

444
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,084
It's got my name on it.
Look at that.

445
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,670
- Wait a minute.
- Finally, you're twenty-one.

446
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:15,714
There's your happy birthday hat.

447
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:18,758
A happy birthday to you.

448
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,552
A present, too?
This is too much.

449
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,512
Look at the way
they decorated this.

450
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,639
Open it up.

451
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,099
Be careful, Gilda. It's hot.

452
00:36:26,142 --> 00:36:28,268
- Hot?
- I didn't see this.

453
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,688
- Oh, look!
- Look at that!

454
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:34,399
Check this out, Georgie.

455
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,692
- Take it off.
- Oh, my Lord.

456
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:40,030
- Panties, too, ma'am.
- Put it on, Gilda.

457
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:42,490
Oh, my Lord, Cultis'd kill me.

458
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,577
I want to know what's under
them little bows.

459
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,580
Here's your piece.
Goddamn, this cake is just...

460
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:55,045
It's Gilda's birthday,
Mr. Hurley.

461
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:56,963
Would you like a piece of cake?

462
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:59,007
Who brought the cake in?

463
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,804
We are three months late
on this contract.

464
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,140
The day we deliver
the last fuel rod to Hanford...

465
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:09,976
we'll only be
one million dollars in the hole.

466
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:11,519
The contract
isn't going to be renewed...

467
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:15,357
and none of us will have a job.
Even this is taking time.

468
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:17,734
Clean those crumbs up
after your shift.

469
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,086
I get to clean up after you
for a change.

470
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:39,339
Have a good time!

471
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,675
It's like staying after school.
I don't know.

472
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,220
- Karen was a bad girl.
- Oh, God.

473
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:59,044
You bring one of these
in every week...

474
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:02,505
and leave it on the shelf
just outside the locker room.

475
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:04,883
We'll monitor them
for radiation.

476
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,428
I'm supposed
to pee in it at home.

477
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,055
That's right.

478
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,339
My hair feels awful.

479
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:53,556
I wish I had some of
that conditioner around.

480
00:39:56,602 --> 00:40:00,105
I'm going to call my mama,
tell her to send some up.

481
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:06,694
She called me the other day.

482
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,116
She said...

483
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:18,456
"Karen Gay, I been thinking
about your nails."

484
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,668
"How are your nails?"

485
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:26,297
"You taking care of them?
You been biting them?"

486
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:34,556
I said, "Oh, boy, I'm taking
good care of them, Mama."

487
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,186
"Don't cut the cuticles, now,
you hear?"

488
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,940
I wish I could
take care of you better.

489
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:56,953
I remember...

490
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,372
in high school
her saying to me...

491
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,666
"Now, what'd you want
to go and sign up..."

492
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,626
"for that science class for?"

493
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:07,297
"There's no girls
in that science class."

494
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,466
"Why don't you take Home Ec?"

495
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:12,010
"That's the way to meet
the nice boys."

496
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:19,976
I said, "Mama,
there ain't no boys in Home Ec."

497
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,563
"Boys are in the science class."

498
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,232
She hated it
when I said "ain't."

499
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,154
Yakety, yakety, yak.

500
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,363
At least he doesn't talk. ..

501
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:34,991
when he doesn't have
something to say.

502
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:43,917
Who?

503
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,964
My daddy.

504
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,617
Does that hurt?

505
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,463
I can't stay away from you.

506
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,260
You know that.

507
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,726
You can be the biggest bitch
God ever made...

508
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,478
and then you
turn around on me...

509
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,064
and you're like this,
and I want to die.

510
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,485
And the next thing I know...

511
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:56,197
you decide about me
not having socks on...

512
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:59,993
the day before,
and you throw a fit.

513
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,288
It's not that, Drew.

514
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,709
- You know.
- I know.

515
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,881
I know what it is.

516
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,053
I know all about you.

517
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,440
You do, don't you?

518
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,657
Poor old Drew.

519
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,880
Haul ass, you guys.

520
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,925
I gotta take my own car.
I'm working a double shift.

521
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:29,934
This says...

522
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:34,439
This says all that stuff
about acceptable levels.. .

523
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,691
it's all bullshit.

524
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:38,192
What is?

525
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,612
Well, it says here.. .

526
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,407
"Plutonium gives you cancer."

527
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,951
Says it flat out.

528
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:49,662
Where'd you get that?

529
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:52,957
It came in all that union stuff
from Washington.

530
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:54,542
You got one. Everybody got one.

531
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:55,877
Hurley works there.

532
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,837
Think he'd work there
if he was going to get cancer?

533
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,800
Listen to this...
"genetic damage."

534
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,218
Meaning what?

535
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,388
Meaning it goes on down
into your kids.

536
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,307
It says here. ..

537
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,437
"Gross physical
and mental defects."

538
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:16,481
I already got them.

539
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,741
Boy, I missed you.

540
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:32,038
How many more nights
you gotta work?

541
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,372
A couple.

542
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,960
You got transferred.

543
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,128
I what?

544
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:42,381
Posted it this morning
as I was leaving.

545
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,383
You're in metallography.

546
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:47,345
What?

547
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:50,139
- Metallography?
- That's what it said.

548
00:46:50,182 --> 00:46:54,936
That'll take me three months
to requalify for overtime!

549
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,564
Shit! I love that!

550
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,900
Hurley throws a fit how
we're late on the contracts.. .

551
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,527
then he transfers me out?

552
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,903
The union going
to help me out now?

553
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:07,782
I'm one of
the best people he's got.

554
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:10,868
I got transferred
to metallography.

555
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,038
Metallography, with Winston?

556
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,709
Now...

557
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,963
them little gray pellets
you've been making...

558
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,799
are put into
those long fuel rods...

559
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:28,344
and the long fuel rods
are packed into bundles...

560
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,890
over at
your friend Drew's section.

561
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:37,603
And after the weld is made,
they take a slice out of it...

562
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:40,273
and they make a cross section.

563
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,275
So, what your job is...

564
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:45,611
is to mount
that cross section over here.

565
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:54,078
And then you grind it,
and you polish it.

566
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:57,790
And here's where
you take a picture of it.

567
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,543
And then you develop it
in the darkroom.

568
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:04,088
Then I inspect the negative for
any imperfections in the weld...

569
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,841
and if it's OK,
we pass on that lot...

570
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:10,094
and they get shipped out.

571
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,643
You're familiar
with developing procedure?

572
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,356
Yeah. I am.

573
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,445
I got some pictures in here.

574
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:29,864
They're all backed up, so...

575
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,198
why don't you
get to work on them...

576
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,201
and then tomorrow
I'll be glad...

577
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,662
to go over the polishing
procedure with you.

578
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,416
Great.

579
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:06,525
What are you doing?

580
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,490
I'm looking at you.

581
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,493
What are you doing
to the negative?

582
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,620
Sometimes when
you take a picture...

583
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,622
you get these
white spots in there...

584
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,666
so we make them go away.

585
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,463
Doesn't somebody have to look
at them to make sure they're OK?

586
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,800
Me.

587
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,593
Yeah, but I mean...

588
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:38,057
- You mean what?
- How do you. ..

589
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:43,562
How do you know if
they're just spots?

590
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:45,606
They could be defects
in the weld.

591
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:50,152
No, no, no.
I've already checked the weld.

592
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,947
I'm just putting
beauty marks on them.

593
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:56,033
Winston,
get away with that thing.

594
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:03,749
Thank you.

595
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,587
I just want to bring y'all
up to date.

596
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:10,715
Some of you
weren't here last time...

597
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,342
and some of you
who were here last time...

598
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,886
aren't here this time,
that's for damn sure.

599
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:22,351
Now, three weeks ago. ..

600
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:25,646
the company got enough names
on this petition...

601
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,442
to hold
a decertification election.

602
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:32,653
I know you all
are confused about this.

603
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,030
What this means is...

604
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:39,952
that the National
Labor Relations Board...

605
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,996
will come in here
and hold an election...

606
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:48,210
where everybody votes whether
to certify or decertify...

607
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:50,755
the union's staying on
in this plant.

608
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,467
Morgan, did I do that right?

609
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,263
What this means...

610
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:01,932
is that we are in deep shit.

611
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:09,106
What this means is,
if we lose this election...

612
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:12,610
there ain't going to be
any union at this plant.

613
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,655
Nobody standing up for us
against Kerr McGee...

614
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:19,325
which I read
in the newspapers...

615
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:23,662
is gonna take in
$1.5 billion this year.

616
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,124
And which, as you all know...

617
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,627
takes about as much time
thinking about our problems...

618
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:31,796
as grease takes
to go through a goose.

619
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,134
We gotta do a lot of work. ..

620
00:51:37,135 --> 00:51:39,845
between now and
the election in October.

621
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,347
We lost a lot of members...

622
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,307
since the strike
didn't work out last year.

623
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:47,019
So now I want to know...

624
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,230
who can help me?

625
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,196
They said if you're really
worried about it...

626
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,865
you're welcome to get involved.

627
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,493
You could be on the committee.

628
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:05,037
What committee?

629
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:06,872
Negotiating committee.

630
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,668
- You?
- Yeah.

631
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,795
On the union
negotiating committee.

632
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:18,717
Karen, let me give you a hint.

633
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,720
Don't flash 'em.

634
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,305
It turns you on.

635
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,266
Yeah, but I'm not management.

636
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,269
- I'm as smart as Hurley is.
- Just as tactful.

637
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,063
You sound like my mother.

638
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,899
You don't just stand
toe to toe with someone...

639
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,902
call him a motherfucker,
and get anywhere.

640
00:52:38,196 --> 00:52:40,239
I'll keep it in mind.

641
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,607
Do you...

642
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,235
Do you feel different
about me...

643
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:21,572
since I got cooked?

644
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,123
What do you mean?

645
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,666
You know.

646
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,132
Well...

647
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,637
I still want to fuck you.

648
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:47,556
I sure as hell don't want
to fuck Thelma anymore.

649
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,478
Oh, Jesus.

650
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,696
I'll give you something.

651
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:10,621
- Where are they?
- They're next door.

652
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,927
Oh, God.

653
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,470
Think you made
enough noise there, Dolly?

654
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,393
You two ain't exactly
a silent movie yourself.

655
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:22,568
This here is Angela.
She's a beautician.

656
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,863
Well, hi there.

657
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:03,150
Personally, I don't see
anything wrong with it.

658
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,194
No. Neither do I.

659
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:10,699
Guess it figures, doesn't it?

660
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:14,411
I can handle it.

661
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,871
Me, too.

662
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,292
So why are we talking about it?

663
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,740
What if we wrote them?

664
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,536
What if we wrote
the national union. ..

665
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,995
told them
what's going on down here?

666
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,997
Maybe they'd help us.

667
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:02,042
We're not going to win
the election by ourselves.

668
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,754
We gotta do something, I think.

669
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,881
Management is putting up
these memos now...

670
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,800
saying no union business
on our breaks.

671
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,718
That's our own time, Quincy.

672
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:16,890
Yeah. They think they can
get away with anything.

673
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:19,017
I'll see you in the morning.

674
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,190
Sounds like they're trying
to get rid of you.

675
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:28,402
They're going to get
a big fight if they try.

676
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:32,281
Karen, you ever been downtown?

677
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,949
There are two big streets.

678
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,202
One's called Kerr,
and one's called McGee.

679
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,079
And that's how I see it.

680
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,372
They own the state.. .

681
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,416
they own everybody
in this state.. .

682
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:46,378
and they own practically
everybody I work on.

683
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,345
What do you think?

684
00:57:56,514 --> 00:58:00,559
What kind of
make-up base do you use?

685
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:02,769
The kind I always use.

686
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:11,737
I don't mind somebody taking
my beers if they replace it.

687
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,031
You're making a big deal
out of everything lately.

688
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,158
Everything's going to hell
around here.

689
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,409
Meaning you're out of beer?

690
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,953
Meaning you're on
the goddamn phone night and day.

691
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,415
Heavy.

692
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,545
What did you do to your face?

693
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,631
Doesn't she look great?

694
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,258
Looks like a fucking corpse.

695
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:36,803
That's not very nice.

696
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,015
It's not very nice to make fun
of what a person does.

697
00:58:40,058 --> 00:58:45,145
If that's what a beautician
does, I'll take mine rare.

698
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:49,733
Drew, Angela works at Thayer's.

699
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,570
Funeral home?

700
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,328
Hell, why didn't you say so?

701
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:07,000
Drew, I can always tell...

702
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,379
when a dead person I beautify
worked for Kerr McGee...

703
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:14,758
because they all look like
they died before they died.

704
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:26,895
Why don't you lay off her?

705
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:29,273
Jesus Christ.

706
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:36,822
I bet there's something to that.

707
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,615
To what?

708
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:43,120
About people looking like
they died before they died.

709
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,205
You know, plutonium and all.

710
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,319
Drew?

711
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,575
Drew, what's your opinion?

712
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,288
It's fine.
The other one was fine, too.

713
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,290
They're all fine.

714
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,000
Honey, this is really important.

715
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:31,835
This is a meeting
with the national union...

716
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,754
and the Atomic Energy
Commission.

717
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:35,213
The national union is paying...

718
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:37,424
for our plane tickets
and our hotel room.

719
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,134
He's just jealous.

720
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,011
Is this meeting
in Washington state...

721
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,596
or Washington, D.C.?

722
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,889
D.C.

723
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:46,099
The one you got on
is much better.

724
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:49,686
OK. I will wear this to the AEC.

725
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,022
And what shall I wear
on the plane?

726
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:53,982
Something that won't wrinkle.

727
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:57,486
Like a shroud, maybe.

728
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:00,864
I get so tired of your jokes.

729
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:09,081
Sir, would you mind
putting your tray down, please?

730
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,918
Thank you.

731
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,294
Thank you.

732
01:01:17,215 --> 01:01:18,799
Thank you.

733
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,260
Miss, how much is this?

734
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,762
It comes with your ticket.

735
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:39,319
we're going to
union headquarters first...

736
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:42,823
and you'll meet Max Richter,
who runs our Washington office.

737
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,909
Then we'll go over what
you're telling the AEC tomorrow.

738
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:48,161
Is the company going to
find out about this?

739
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,622
It's highly unlikely.

740
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:54,376
Whenever the AEC Inspector
comes to the plant...

741
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:57,421
anybody says anything to him,
the company finds out.

742
01:01:57,463 --> 01:02:01,174
Yeah, right.
Maybe you could bring that up.

743
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,968
Could we stop over there?

744
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,972
Excuse me.
Could we stop? Please?

745
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:10,267
Yeah. Sure. OK.

746
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:14,855
Look this way. Straight ahead.

747
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:17,441
Yeah, that's good. Perfect.

748
01:02:18,943 --> 01:02:21,820
Bobby Beckwith
tore a hole in his glove.

749
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:25,240
Let me see
if I can read this here.

750
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,284
I think it says July the 23rd.

751
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:30,120
Isn't that about right, Morgan?

752
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:34,249
Yeah. That was right before
Karen came back...

753
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:37,711
and they tried to pin
the contamination on her.

754
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:45,343
The plutonium soaked through
his coveralls to his arm.

755
01:02:45,386 --> 01:02:47,596
what the hell
is going on out there?

756
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:53,059
It's National "Something" Day.

757
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:58,190
Can't breathe.

758
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:01,568
- What?
- Can't breathe.

759
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:06,573
There's a lot of stuff here
about the respirators.

760
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,658
We get these contaminations...

761
01:03:08,701 --> 01:03:12,412
and sometimes
we got to wear these masks...

762
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:15,707
for a week, 10 days,
sometimes 12 hours a day.

763
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,334
Are you working 12 hours?

764
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:20,921
They're late on the contract.
Running double shifts.

765
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,924
And they got us working
in these respirators...

766
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,385
and I want to tell you,
it gets real hot.

767
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,471
And they don't fit.

768
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:31,598
I mean, mine doesn't fit.

769
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:34,768
What you people have
brought in today is wonderful.

770
01:03:34,852 --> 01:03:40,982
Excuse me.
I just wanted to say one thing.

771
01:03:41,025 --> 01:03:43,485
That was the thing
about the showers.

772
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:48,406
There are only two showers
for 75 workers per shift.

773
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:54,871
And it's not really clean.

774
01:03:54,872 --> 01:03:58,667
Everybody wanted me
to say something about that.

775
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:03,129
Right. It's probably best
if we stick to the stuff...

776
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,756
that's really connected
with the radiation.

777
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:10,929
What about
that contaminated truck?

778
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:13,723
They cut up this hot truck
and buried it.

779
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,433
Right. That was in your letter.

780
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:18,270
I've got to catch my plane.
Paul will take care of you.

781
01:04:18,312 --> 01:04:20,230
The only way
we can get enough votes...

782
01:04:20,231 --> 01:04:22,148
to keep the union
in your plant.. .

783
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,693
is on the health
and safety issue.

784
01:04:24,735 --> 01:04:28,071
So we'll get a couple of
hotshot doctors in to speak.

785
01:04:28,072 --> 01:04:30,282
You keep telling
Paul all this stuff.

786
01:04:30,324 --> 01:04:32,784
And try to get
everything clear...

787
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,453
for the AEC tomorrow, all right?

788
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:38,790
I'll be back in a second.

789
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,292
Max?

790
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:45,964
I'm going to go find a restroom.

791
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,266
Excuse me.
There's one more thing.

792
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:58,977
I work in metallography.
In X-rays.

793
01:04:58,978 --> 01:05:03,023
And sometimes we...

794
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:06,484
Quite frankly,
we have negatives altered.

795
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,449
The negatives of the welds
in the fuel rods.

796
01:05:12,491 --> 01:05:16,953
They take a weld
and cross section it.

797
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:20,206
Then they photograph it,
and there's a defect.

798
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:24,085
Then they just touch it up.

799
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:26,087
Touch it up?

800
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:30,592
With a Pentel pen.
Right on the negatives.

801
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:32,010
They fill in the white spots.

802
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,346
You're talking about
X-rays of fuel rods?

803
01:05:34,388 --> 01:05:37,265
The fuel rods
they're sending up to that...

804
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,644
We're sending up to
that breeder reactor...

805
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,355
they're testing in Hanford.

806
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,358
Do you know what that means?

807
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,818
I know they shouldn't do it.

808
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:50,862
Excuse us.

809
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,907
Why don't we go in there?

810
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,828
In an ordinary nuclear plant...

811
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:01,206
you can have meltdowns,
poisonous gas, and dead people.

812
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:05,210
That's nothing compared to what
can go wrong with a breeder.

813
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:09,297
You put defective fuel rods
in a breeder reactor...

814
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:13,343
for all we know, the whole
state could be wiped out.

815
01:06:13,386 --> 01:06:15,679
Can you get
documentation of that?

816
01:06:18,933 --> 01:06:20,558
I guess so.

817
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:24,270
If you could get documentation,
that would be very important.

818
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,440
We'll set you up with a reporter
from the "New York Times". ..

819
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,485
get the company up against
the wall on negotiations.

820
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:33,029
But you'd have to have
documentation.

821
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:35,907
I don't know about putting
names in the newspaper.

822
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,242
Names aren't the point.

823
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,703
The point is
that if you're right...

824
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:41,496
they could kill off
two million people.

825
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:46,251
There's a moral imperative
involved here.

826
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:54,342
Think about it. Talk to Paul.

827
01:06:54,385 --> 01:06:56,428
You look like a standup girl.

828
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:58,179
I'll be right there.

829
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,991
I've never seen
so many bands in my life.

830
01:07:35,843 --> 01:07:38,720
All right,
we're going to go over...

831
01:07:38,763 --> 01:07:40,388
your statements
for the AEC meeting.

832
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:43,683
And later, you and I
will go through yours.

833
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,941
There was 23 people there,
including us.

834
01:07:51,942 --> 01:07:53,109
Of course, I couldn't
take any pictures...

835
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:55,028
while the meeting was going on.

836
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:57,530
Just imagine
all these old geezers...

837
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,532
sitting there,
pitchers of water...

838
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,284
and they all looked so bored.

839
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:03,953
It's like they had
heard it all before.

840
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:07,957
I think the union's
really going to help us now.

841
01:08:09,543 --> 01:08:10,960
That doesn't
belong in here at all.

842
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:15,632
That's one of them slides
you can buy.

843
01:08:15,633 --> 01:08:18,593
Oh, hell. May, did you
put them in this order?

844
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,721
I didn't touch them, Quincy.

845
01:08:21,764 --> 01:08:25,683
There's the Lincoln Memorial,
of course.

846
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:27,560
That's where we stayed.

847
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,729
I couldn't get it
all in the picture.

848
01:08:31,982 --> 01:08:34,567
You could get dinner
in your room if you wanted...

849
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,195
but we didn't.

850
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,200
I had one of the waiters
take this one.

851
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:44,828
Who's that guy?

852
01:08:44,870 --> 01:08:47,497
That's Paul Stone.
He works for the union.

853
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:52,961
This is on the way
to the airport.

854
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:54,921
And that's the White House.

855
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,006
I wanted to take a picture
of Ol' Gerry Ford...

856
01:08:57,049 --> 01:09:00,677
cooking his English muffin,
but they wouldn't let us in.

857
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,816
How many people know about
you going to Washington?

858
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,319
Only the people in that room.

859
01:09:18,362 --> 01:09:21,197
Quincy and Morgan
know about your spying?

860
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:24,909
No.

861
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:31,624
People are going
to lose jobs, Karen.

862
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:34,711
Some of them ought to.

863
01:09:34,753 --> 01:09:37,213
There's a moral imperative here.

864
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:44,596
You going to put
some big story in the papers?

865
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:45,889
In the "New York Times."

866
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,017
In the "New York Times."

867
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:55,273
Guess that about ties
the package up with a bow.

868
01:10:35,314 --> 01:10:37,273
What's the matter with him?

869
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,986
Some guy in Washington
I should have told him about.

870
01:10:42,029 --> 01:10:46,032
- Is that all?
- No.

871
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:07,845
What you doing?

872
01:11:09,723 --> 01:11:11,224
Thinking.

873
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:24,570
Thinking. Drinking.

874
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:30,535
I was just thinking...

875
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:33,162
if you'd ever quit
and come away with me.

876
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:41,838
Well, I can't quit now.

877
01:11:41,839 --> 01:11:45,341
That's what I was thinking.

878
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:59,022
It's cold out here.

879
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:01,816
Come on inside.

880
01:12:01,859 --> 01:12:03,359
I quit.

881
01:12:08,532 --> 01:12:10,533
You what?

882
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:13,036
This afternoon. Gave my notice.

883
01:12:13,037 --> 01:12:15,538
- You quit?
- That's what I said.

884
01:12:20,044 --> 01:12:22,045
This afternoon?

885
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,216
Why didn't you tell me?

886
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,847
I don't know.
I just didn't tell you.

887
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:41,522
why'd you quit?

888
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:48,029
I just don't give a shit.

889
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,583
You don't give a shit
if everybody in the plant...

890
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:02,794
is being poisoned?

891
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:29,112
Don't give me a problem
I can't solve.

892
01:14:15,325 --> 01:14:17,285
Did you take
the waylon Jennings tapes?

893
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,287
I left them for you.

894
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:22,081
They're yours.
You can take them.

895
01:14:23,834 --> 01:14:26,294
You can keep them, Karen.

896
01:14:32,843 --> 01:14:34,552
Take it easy, Dolly.

897
01:15:06,251 --> 01:15:09,086
Drew, come on. Stay.

898
01:15:10,964 --> 01:15:14,383
Sweetheart, it's like
you're two people.

899
01:15:14,384 --> 01:15:16,260
I'm in love with one of them...

900
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:18,095
but the other one's...

901
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:21,516
Just a general pain in the ass.

902
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:03,808
I loved it, baby.

903
01:17:16,256 --> 01:17:17,757
What are you doing in there?

904
01:17:26,183 --> 01:17:29,810
What are you doing in my desk?

905
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:33,439
If I tell you, you'll promise
not to tell anybody?

906
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,862
I keep my pills in there,
in that drawer...

907
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:42,740
because I have an allergy...

908
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:46,035
and they don't let you bring
medication into the plant...

909
01:17:46,036 --> 01:17:48,245
so I hid them in there.

910
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,416
I don't believe you.

911
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:58,506
I think you should take
a person's word for something.

912
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:31,622
These don't look like
antihistamines to me.

913
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:36,752
Winston,
you know what these are?

914
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:41,465
These are little
tiny time capsules. ..

915
01:18:41,466 --> 01:18:45,553
like the ones you see on TV.

916
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:47,763
They clear up
your nasal passages...

917
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:51,267
for up to 12 hours straight.

918
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:01,193
- Excuse me.
- God bless you.

919
01:19:03,196 --> 01:19:05,781
In the coal mines years ago...

920
01:19:05,782 --> 01:19:09,702
they used to put canaries
in the tunnels.

921
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,037
If the canaries dropped dead...

922
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,123
they knew there was a gas leak.

923
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:19,253
But it's a brand-new industry...

924
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,089
so you're the canaries.

925
01:19:22,132 --> 01:19:25,301
The trouble is, you're not going
to drop dead right away.

926
01:19:25,302 --> 01:19:28,345
It might take ten years.
Twenty. We don't know.

927
01:19:28,388 --> 01:19:35,770
Here's what we know...
Plutonium causes cancer.

928
01:19:35,812 --> 01:19:37,271
Anybody tells you
we don't know...

929
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:40,316
how much plutonium
causes cancer, they're lying.

930
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:42,234
What we don't know...

931
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:46,739
is how little plutonium
causes cancer.

932
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,365
The government says.. .

933
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:51,160
that the maximum
permissible body burden.. .

934
01:19:51,161 --> 01:19:54,038
for your lifetime
is 40 nanocuries.

935
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:55,915
Let me tell you
how much that is.

936
01:19:55,957 --> 01:20:01,420
That is a tiny dot
on a piece of paper.

937
01:20:01,463 --> 01:20:06,634
we say that's too much.

938
01:20:06,676 --> 01:20:12,973
We say that it takes
less than that to kill you.

939
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:15,726
We don't say
it's twice too much...

940
01:20:15,769 --> 01:20:17,728
or three times too much.

941
01:20:17,771 --> 01:20:24,693
We think that that is
115,000 times too much.

942
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:30,199
A pollen-sized
grain of plutonium.. .

943
01:20:30,242 --> 01:20:33,702
injected in mice causes cancer.

944
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:38,916
When you inhale it,
and it lodges in your lungs...

945
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:42,503
you're married to cancer.

946
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,422
We've been through
all the training literature.. .

947
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:48,551
Kerr McGee hands out
to new employees...

948
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:52,054
and there's nothing
about cancer.

949
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:58,769
Did management give you
any literature about cancer?

950
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:01,981
Then you get contaminated,
and they tell you...

951
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:03,941
you've had an acceptable level
of contamination.

952
01:21:03,942 --> 01:21:07,278
I say there's no such thing.

953
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:11,532
There must be some questions.

954
01:21:17,581 --> 01:21:21,959
Is there any way to get
the plutonium out of you...

955
01:21:21,960 --> 01:21:26,255
if it's inside your lungs?

956
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:31,218
You can take the lung out,
but that's a little extreme.

957
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:43,480
You want to get
something to eat?

958
01:21:43,523 --> 01:21:45,608
Very nice meeting you.

959
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,568
Have a good night.

960
01:21:47,611 --> 01:21:49,737
That was great.

961
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:52,197
The union is really in solid.

962
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,199
we don't have to worry about...

963
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:57,036
How come why didn't we hear
any of this before?

964
01:21:57,078 --> 01:21:58,829
And we didn't see
any of you guys...

965
01:21:58,872 --> 01:22:04,543
until they decided
to vote the union out or not?

966
01:22:04,586 --> 01:22:05,753
If you're so worried about us...

967
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,087
where the hell were you
in the beginning?

968
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:09,506
What we're saying
is you need someone...

969
01:22:09,507 --> 01:22:11,216
looking out for
your health and safety.

970
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:13,052
The company says
they're taking care of you.

971
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:14,303
Do you believe that?

972
01:22:14,304 --> 01:22:16,430
- Yeah. I believe that.
- You do?

973
01:22:16,473 --> 01:22:18,474
You're the only guy
in that room that still does.

974
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:20,476
Let me tell you something else.

975
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:22,937
Doesn't matter if you work
on plutonium or dog food...

976
01:22:22,979 --> 01:22:24,605
because
they won't give you a thing.

977
01:22:24,648 --> 01:22:27,858
There's nowhere left to go.
You start causing problems...

978
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:31,862
and Kerr McGee shuts
that plant down, then what?

979
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:35,032
You're up in Washington, D.C.

980
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:38,619
We're down here out of work.

981
01:22:38,662 --> 01:22:41,664
Your cancer is a maybe.
That's all it is.

982
01:22:50,006 --> 01:22:52,508
- He's just scared.
- Yeah.

983
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,218
The meeting was really good.

984
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:59,181
Yeah, look...
I got an early plane, Karen.

985
01:22:59,182 --> 01:23:01,308
Meaning what?

986
01:23:01,351 --> 01:23:05,604
I don't think this is smart,
us getting involved.

987
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:08,273
We already got involved.

988
01:23:36,970 --> 01:23:39,638
Hi. This is Paul Stone.

989
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:40,848
I'm out right now...

990
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:43,308
but if you leave
a message after the beep...

991
01:23:43,351 --> 01:23:46,228
I'll get back to you.

992
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:48,772
Hi, this is Karen.

993
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:54,361
I just wanted to let you know...

994
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:58,657
that we won
the union election 80 to 61...

995
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,869
and I'm real happy.

996
01:24:05,457 --> 01:24:07,458
It's real hard
to keep calling you...

997
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:09,293
from a pay phone
if you're never there...

998
01:24:09,335 --> 01:24:13,922
so that's why
I'm calling you from here.

999
01:24:15,592 --> 01:24:19,011
I have some things that...

1000
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,554
I really need
to talk to you about...

1001
01:24:20,597 --> 01:24:23,348
and I just wish
that I could talk to you.

1002
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:27,936
Been under a lot
of pressure here, boy.

1003
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:30,522
It's great
we won and everything.. .

1004
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:33,984
but just.. .

1005
01:24:33,985 --> 01:24:37,821
Been under really
a lot of pressure, and...

1006
01:24:37,822 --> 01:24:40,199
I don't know. I feel like I'm...

1007
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,998
All alone.

1008
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:55,214
Guess you didn't hear
that last part.

1009
01:25:11,064 --> 01:25:13,649
Come on!

1010
01:25:17,278 --> 01:25:18,946
Do you want coffee?

1011
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:41,885
I went to make popcorn
last night.. .

1012
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:43,595
and there's no Wesson oil.

1013
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,848
So, go get some.

1014
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,474
I'm not in charge
of the Wesson oil...

1015
01:25:47,517 --> 01:25:49,184
I'm not in charge
of the shopping.

1016
01:25:49,185 --> 01:25:51,353
I can't do it every time.

1017
01:25:51,354 --> 01:25:54,731
I can't do it this afternoon.
I got a union meeting.

1018
01:25:54,774 --> 01:25:56,275
If you're talking like that...

1019
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:58,068
to impress that
outside agitator of yours...

1020
01:25:58,069 --> 01:25:59,570
he ain't here, so cut the shit.

1021
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,698
We can't do the shopping
unless you give us your key.

1022
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:07,870
what happened to your key?

1023
01:26:07,912 --> 01:26:10,372
If we knew that,
we wouldn't need yours.

1024
01:26:10,373 --> 01:26:14,418
- I lost it.
- You lost it.

1025
01:26:16,921 --> 01:26:18,589
Leave it under the step.

1026
01:26:18,631 --> 01:26:21,592
What if somebody rapes me
because you lost your key?

1027
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:24,678
Who's going to rape you
that you ain't already fucked?

1028
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:40,736
- Hiya, Thelma.
- Hi, honey.

1029
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:46,033
- How are you doing?
- Pretty good.

1030
01:26:46,075 --> 01:26:48,744
I was trying to get
blood for my daughter.. .

1031
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:52,331
and Hurley said asking
people at the plant. ..

1032
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,708
is against union rules.

1033
01:26:54,751 --> 01:26:57,794
Oh, yeah? He said that?

1034
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:07,012
The workers in this plant...

1035
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:10,098
have certified us
as their representatives...

1036
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:14,061
so we should get started
on some real negotiations.

1037
01:27:14,103 --> 01:27:16,104
I talked to the lawyer
last week downtown.

1038
01:27:16,147 --> 01:27:19,691
He said he'd get back
to me on Monday.

1039
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,401
You said that last week.

1040
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:25,322
He hasn't gotten back to me yet.

1041
01:27:25,323 --> 01:27:27,532
Excuse me.

1042
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:33,372
Mr. Hurley, did you tell
an employee in wet processing...

1043
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:37,084
that it was against
union rules to give blood?

1044
01:27:38,962 --> 01:27:40,837
I don't recall saying that, no.

1045
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,633
Good. Because I just called
the bloodmobile...

1046
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:46,969
and they can come over
on Tuesday.

1047
01:27:53,893 --> 01:27:56,186
No, don't wake them up.

1048
01:27:56,187 --> 01:27:57,813
Just...

1049
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:02,818
Tell them I called again.

1050
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,486
And...

1051
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,448
Tell them Mama's OK...

1052
01:28:08,491 --> 01:28:12,369
and I love them...

1053
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,578
and I miss them...

1054
01:28:13,621 --> 01:28:16,873
and I'll come see them
as soon as I can.

1055
01:28:16,874 --> 01:28:19,543
Yeah, I know.
I'm not always here...

1056
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:21,962
but we're working double shifts.

1057
01:28:22,005 --> 01:28:26,967
But Dolly can always
take a message.

1058
01:28:27,010 --> 01:28:29,469
OK.

1059
01:28:29,512 --> 01:28:31,513
Thank you.

1060
01:28:41,357 --> 01:28:43,525
What's the matter?

1061
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:45,360
Nothing.

1062
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,575
I miss Drew.

1063
01:28:53,494 --> 01:28:54,828
Call him up.

1064
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,501
Angela went back to her husband.

1065
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,758
Gee, Dolly, I'm sorry.

1066
01:29:10,261 --> 01:29:11,762
You OK?

1067
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,722
You could have thought
of that this morning...

1068
01:29:13,723 --> 01:29:16,224
before your nineteenth
nervous breakdown.

1069
01:29:18,311 --> 01:29:21,938
Don't you lay this off on me.

1070
01:29:21,981 --> 01:29:24,983
Anybody else would have
thrown Angela out day one.

1071
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:27,778
When Drew was here,
you weren't like this.

1072
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,406
You think Angela left
on account of me?

1073
01:29:31,407 --> 01:29:34,534
Let me tell you something, girl.

1074
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:38,372
Drew left on account
of you and Angela.

1075
01:29:38,414 --> 01:29:41,375
If you believe that,
you're crazier than people say.

1076
01:29:41,417 --> 01:29:43,752
You took about as
good care of Drew...

1077
01:29:43,753 --> 01:29:46,129
as you took of your kids.

1078
01:30:04,357 --> 01:30:08,527
I know that you took
good care of your kids.

1079
01:30:21,332 --> 01:30:23,333
You know...

1080
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:28,797
the only thing everybody
says I'm crazy about...

1081
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,341
is to live with you.

1082
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,141
You mean with a dyke?

1083
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,270
I mean with a person
who thinks she's in love...

1084
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:48,316
with a person who puts
lipstick on stiffs...

1085
01:30:48,359 --> 01:30:51,403
and smells like formaldehyde.

1086
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:54,364
She didn't smell
like formaldehyde.

1087
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:57,826
She did so.

1088
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:00,871
And I'm so tired of her jokes.

1089
01:31:14,844 --> 01:31:17,846
You know, maybe...

1090
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,724
maybe Drew is right.

1091
01:31:25,104 --> 01:31:28,815
Maybe we should just quit...

1092
01:31:28,858 --> 01:31:31,318
get out of here.

1093
01:31:31,360 --> 01:31:33,528
Move someplace where it's clean.

1094
01:31:37,366 --> 01:31:39,117
You and me?

1095
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:47,834
Jesus, Dolly.

1096
01:31:47,877 --> 01:31:49,711
Well...

1097
01:32:28,834 --> 01:32:31,795
Hush-a-bye.

1098
01:32:31,837 --> 01:32:33,838
Don't you cry.

1099
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:40,637
Go to sleep, you little baby.

1100
01:32:43,099 --> 01:32:46,518
When you wake.

1101
01:32:46,519 --> 01:32:50,522
You shall have.

1102
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:56,736
All the pretty little horses.

1103
01:33:16,882 --> 01:33:20,135
- I don't want it.
- Eat something, Karen.

1104
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,515
I'm not hungry.

1105
01:33:27,852 --> 01:33:30,895
That's just like Curtis.
When he works late...

1106
01:33:30,938 --> 01:33:33,356
he don't get enough sleep
and loses his appetite.

1107
01:33:33,399 --> 01:33:36,192
I've been blending up
these shakes...

1108
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:38,486
with bananas
and chocolate syrup...

1109
01:33:38,487 --> 01:33:41,239
and making him drink them
on the way to work.

1110
01:33:41,282 --> 01:33:43,575
Curtis is out working late?

1111
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:48,330
- Out partying at the Red Dog.
- Come on, Wesley.

1112
01:33:48,331 --> 01:33:51,916
He's been up four nights
in a row flushing out pipes.

1113
01:33:51,959 --> 01:33:53,960
They come up short again.

1114
01:33:54,003 --> 01:33:56,588
They come up short on plutonium?

1115
01:33:56,672 --> 01:33:58,506
He's telling you
he's working late...

1116
01:33:58,507 --> 01:34:01,301
but he's seeing a hot
little number from Edmond.

1117
01:34:03,262 --> 01:34:04,429
Don't forget the banana...

1118
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:08,475
and you can put in an egg
if you want to.

1119
01:34:08,517 --> 01:34:10,435
They say they were missing
more than a kilo?

1120
01:34:18,277 --> 01:34:19,569
I'll see you later.

1121
01:34:19,612 --> 01:34:22,864
Why are you writing it down?

1122
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:26,117
The union is supposed
to keep track of these things.

1123
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:29,329
Am I right? OK. So?

1124
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:35,418
You won your election.

1125
01:34:36,504 --> 01:34:40,131
We are still negotiating
a contract here.

1126
01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,135
Well...

1127
01:34:44,178 --> 01:34:47,138
Why don't you concentrate
on upping our wages...

1128
01:34:47,181 --> 01:34:49,599
and skip over
what is none of our business?

1129
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:51,893
This is our business, honey.

1130
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,740
Karen, I like my job!

1131
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,632
And I found out
that this 18-year-old kid...

1132
01:35:22,675 --> 01:35:25,677
had been underneath
uncapping the drain...

1133
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:29,973
and a cup of the solution
dumped right down on him.

1134
01:35:30,015 --> 01:35:31,683
Right on his head.

1135
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:33,309
So they shaved his head...

1136
01:35:33,352 --> 01:35:35,729
and now the stubble
is growing in hot.

1137
01:35:35,771 --> 01:35:38,356
Jesus, that's terrible.

1138
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,150
Are you getting
the stuff together?

1139
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:45,655
Maintenance people are exposed
to more hot stuff than anybody.

1140
01:35:45,656 --> 01:35:49,826
Look, Karen, the X-rays
are really important.

1141
01:35:49,869 --> 01:35:51,661
We're going into
the contract negotiations...

1142
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:53,329
and we want to get the guy
from the "Times" down there..."

1143
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:55,665
in mid-November.
That's three weeks.

1144
01:35:55,708 --> 01:35:59,669
I know, I know.
I'm getting the stuff.

1145
01:35:59,712 --> 01:36:03,214
It's just not that easy.

1146
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,350
"Morgan!"

1147
01:36:57,603 --> 01:37:01,689
- You scared me.
- Meant to.

1148
01:37:01,732 --> 01:37:03,775
I'm doing something good.

1149
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:05,652
I know what you're doing...

1150
01:37:05,694 --> 01:37:07,862
and you're the wrong person
to be doing it.

1151
01:37:07,863 --> 01:37:11,866
And it's dangerous.
That's all I'm saying.

1152
01:38:14,096 --> 01:38:16,014
Thank you, Curtis.
It's good to know.

1153
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:19,767
Gilda says Karen
is going to get...

1154
01:38:19,810 --> 01:38:21,603
one of those
Sherlock Holmes hats.

1155
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:25,523
Then she'll find everything
that's missing in the plant.

1156
01:38:33,574 --> 01:38:36,868
Winston, seen my clipboard?

1157
01:38:38,537 --> 01:38:39,537
No.

1158
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,088
Why don't you speak
to the union. ..

1159
01:38:49,131 --> 01:38:50,757
about how you're late
for work all the time?

1160
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:52,216
Late from your break.

1161
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:53,635
Supposed to be in here
ten minutes ago...

1162
01:38:53,636 --> 01:38:55,637
instead of wherever you were.

1163
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:00,642
Tell them that next time
you go to Washington.

1164
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:31,547
Stopped in to say hi to y'all.

1165
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:35,051
God, I don't know
hardly any of you people.

1166
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:43,059
Gilda, you have any time?

1167
01:39:43,102 --> 01:39:47,188
Maybe I could talk to you
on your break?

1168
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:49,232
I can't, Karen.

1169
01:39:51,652 --> 01:39:54,904
Just for a couple minutes?

1170
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:58,658
Maybe next week.

1171
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:04,038
You monitoring yourself, Karen?

1172
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:05,289
Yes, Georgie!

1173
01:40:05,332 --> 01:40:06,916
I hope you write it down...

1174
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:09,544
in your little notebook
every time you don't!

1175
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:12,588
Along with the stuff
about the rest of us!

1176
01:40:13,716 --> 01:40:17,719
Oh, no! No! Damn it!

1177
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:33,317
They haven't found
a hole in the glove...

1178
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:34,902
but they're still checking.

1179
01:40:34,903 --> 01:40:37,905
It's a very slight
external contamination.

1180
01:40:37,948 --> 01:40:39,782
An acceptable level.

1181
01:40:39,783 --> 01:40:43,244
And you're clean now.

1182
01:40:43,287 --> 01:40:45,329
Been bringing your samples in?

1183
01:40:45,372 --> 01:40:46,956
Every week.

1184
01:40:46,999 --> 01:40:49,167
Start bringing them in
on a daily basis.

1185
01:40:49,209 --> 01:40:53,212
You can pick up your kits
on the way out of the plant.

1186
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:58,968
Boy, I'll be happy the day
I don't have to pee in a jar.

1187
01:41:51,939 --> 01:41:53,648
Are you all right?

1188
01:41:56,318 --> 01:41:58,861
Yeah. I'm all right.

1189
01:41:58,904 --> 01:42:01,364
Would you call somebody for me?

1190
01:42:01,365 --> 01:42:03,157
Yeah, sure.

1191
01:43:11,143 --> 01:43:14,562
<i>Look! Drew! My God, you're back!</i>

1192
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:17,440
I missed you so much!
Look at your little face!

1193
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,442
Dolly, stop!

1194
01:43:19,484 --> 01:43:21,777
Jesus, I'm late.

1195
01:43:21,778 --> 01:43:24,614
Look at your little body!

1196
01:43:27,743 --> 01:43:29,619
Is she OK?

1197
01:43:31,079 --> 01:43:32,955
Shit!

1198
01:43:38,545 --> 01:43:41,881
I spilled my urine sample.

1199
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:49,555
Her and that union monkey
got nothing going anymore.

1200
01:43:49,598 --> 01:43:52,683
It's strictly business.
Are you moving back in?

1201
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:54,727
I got a place of my own, Dolly.

1202
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:57,146
You two can come stay with me
anytime you want.

1203
01:44:01,777 --> 01:44:03,736
Bologna and cheese.

1204
01:44:04,947 --> 01:44:06,614
Jesus!

1205
01:44:19,294 --> 01:44:21,212
If you're back,
I'm really glad you're back.

1206
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:05,256
Good morning.

1207
01:45:05,257 --> 01:45:07,258
Hi, Karen. How you doing?

1208
01:45:07,259 --> 01:45:09,385
I'm in the pink.

1209
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,727
Oh, God!

1210
01:45:24,026 --> 01:45:25,276
Don't!

1211
01:45:30,532 --> 01:45:34,243
No! Stop it!

1212
01:45:34,244 --> 01:45:36,620
Stop it! Stop it!

1213
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,542
Earl, what's going on?

1214
01:45:41,543 --> 01:45:42,710
Dolly, this won't take long...

1215
01:45:42,753 --> 01:45:44,253
but I don't want you
getting in our way.

1216
01:45:44,296 --> 01:45:48,174
Who the hell are these people?

1217
01:45:48,216 --> 01:45:52,636
This is my house!
Tell me what's going.. .

1218
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:46,690
One package of S.O.S.

1219
01:46:46,733 --> 01:46:49,151
One box of S.O.S.

1220
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,570
One bottle of Spray 'n Wipe.

1221
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:53,322
One bottle of Spray 'n Wipe.

1222
01:46:53,323 --> 01:46:56,992
One pack of Rice-a-roni.

1223
01:46:57,035 --> 01:46:59,370
One package Rice-a-roni.

1224
01:46:59,371 --> 01:47:02,957
Three framed photographs.

1225
01:47:02,999 --> 01:47:06,669
Don't take those!

1226
01:47:06,711 --> 01:47:09,672
These are my kids' pictures.

1227
01:47:09,714 --> 01:47:12,675
Earl, don't let them take
my babies' pictures.

1228
01:47:12,717 --> 01:47:15,678
If you're going to watch,
you have to stand back now.

1229
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:18,180
Mr. Hurley,
they're taking everything.

1230
01:47:18,223 --> 01:47:20,516
Listen to me.

1231
01:47:20,517 --> 01:47:23,436
We're getting readings from
the sink, the toilet seat...

1232
01:47:23,478 --> 01:47:24,895
from the make-up you touched...

1233
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,981
from the bologna and cheese
in the refrigerator...

1234
01:47:27,023 --> 01:47:28,774
from your samples...

1235
01:47:28,817 --> 01:47:31,152
and we're getting next to
nothing on Drew and Dolly...

1236
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:32,403
and your car
is absolutely clean.

1237
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:35,698
How do you explain that?

1238
01:47:35,699 --> 01:47:38,367
- I don't know.
- Think about it, Karen.

1239
01:47:38,410 --> 01:47:39,869
- I have to go.
- Where you going?

1240
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:42,079
- I have to go with him.
- No!

1241
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,831
I'll be OK.
I have it under control.

1242
01:47:43,832 --> 01:47:46,375
- Don't go anywhere with him.
- It's all right.

1243
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:49,503
I'm coming!
Keep your goddamn hands off!

1244
01:47:49,504 --> 01:47:51,088
It's all right.

1245
01:47:55,343 --> 01:47:57,261
Come on, Karen. Concentrate.

1246
01:47:57,304 --> 01:47:59,555
How did that plutonium
get in my house?

1247
01:47:59,598 --> 01:48:01,557
Did you put it there?

1248
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:05,728
Did I what? Are you crazy?

1249
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:07,646
You think I put...

1250
01:48:07,689 --> 01:48:10,566
You think
I'd contaminate myself?

1251
01:48:10,609 --> 01:48:13,861
I think you'd do anything
to hurt this company.

1252
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,033
- Then I spilled it.
- What?

1253
01:48:19,075 --> 01:48:21,410
I spilled
my urine sample container.

1254
01:48:21,411 --> 01:48:24,580
Somebody must have put
plutonium in my container.

1255
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:27,583
And then I spilled it
on my bathroom floor.

1256
01:48:27,584 --> 01:48:32,213
I cleaned it all up
and my hands must have got hot.

1257
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:34,715
And then what did I touch?

1258
01:48:34,716 --> 01:48:36,717
OK, I touched my sink...

1259
01:48:36,718 --> 01:48:40,221
I touched my make-up...

1260
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:44,225
and I forget what stuff
in the refrigerator.

1261
01:48:44,226 --> 01:48:48,229
That's it. See?

1262
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:50,189
Somebody spiked
my urine sample container.

1263
01:48:50,232 --> 01:48:52,107
- Who?
- Boy!

1264
01:48:52,150 --> 01:48:54,860
How do I know who?
Anybody could have done it.

1265
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:58,322
You leave it sitting there by
the punch-in at the plant!

1266
01:48:58,365 --> 01:49:02,785
Anybody could've dropped
a little plutonium in there.

1267
01:49:02,827 --> 01:49:06,163
There's a lot of people
at the plant hate me.

1268
01:49:06,206 --> 01:49:09,250
The whole house is hot.
How did it get hot?

1269
01:49:09,251 --> 01:49:11,252
I spilled it! I told you, man!

1270
01:49:11,253 --> 01:49:12,753
That doesn't explain
the readings. ..

1271
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:14,922
we're getting
on your nasal smear.

1272
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:17,258
45,000 DPM.

1273
01:49:19,886 --> 01:49:21,345
What?

1274
01:49:21,388 --> 01:49:23,389
45,000 DPM.

1275
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,016
Oh, my Jesus.

1276
01:49:27,894 --> 01:49:32,523
I'm internally contaminated.
That's what you mean.

1277
01:49:32,524 --> 01:49:33,857
We don't know what it means.

1278
01:49:33,900 --> 01:49:36,485
- That's what you mean!
- Karen, calm down.

1279
01:49:41,408 --> 01:49:43,534
Karen, listen.

1280
01:49:43,535 --> 01:49:45,828
Get out of my way!

1281
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:54,420
Oh, Jesus!
Where am I going to go now?

1282
01:49:54,462 --> 01:49:56,880
I don't have anyplace to go now.

1283
01:49:56,923 --> 01:50:00,342
We're getting a room for Dolly.
we want to help you.

1284
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:02,386
We can help you
with a place to stay.

1285
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,096
We can help you with money.

1286
01:50:16,359 --> 01:50:20,487
But first I have
to sign something, right?

1287
01:50:20,488 --> 01:50:25,242
You want me to sign a statement
saying I did all this.

1288
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:28,370
Just in your own words
what happened.

1289
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,879
OK.

1290
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:47,598
In my own words?

1291
01:50:49,726 --> 01:50:51,727
I'm contaminated.

1292
01:50:53,521 --> 01:50:55,522
I'm dying.

1293
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:48,987
What are you doing here?

1294
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:53,325
I'm just looking around,
like you.

1295
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:02,603
You're here.

1296
01:55:02,604 --> 01:55:05,981
Jesus Christ.
I didn't know where you were.

1297
01:55:08,026 --> 01:55:10,110
What the hell happened?

1298
01:55:15,408 --> 01:55:17,326
They're killing me.

1299
01:55:17,327 --> 01:55:18,702
They're trying to kill me.

1300
01:55:18,745 --> 01:55:21,747
They want me
to stop what I'm doing.

1301
01:55:21,789 --> 01:55:25,500
They contaminated me,
you know that?

1302
01:55:25,501 --> 01:55:28,128
I'm internally contaminated now.

1303
01:55:29,964 --> 01:55:32,174
Now, you listen to me.

1304
01:55:32,216 --> 01:55:35,218
We're going to go
to Los Alamos on Thursday...

1305
01:55:35,261 --> 01:55:37,220
and we'll get a full body count
from some doctors...

1306
01:55:37,263 --> 01:55:39,014
who know what they're doing.
All three of us.

1307
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:42,768
Oh, God! I'm so scared now.

1308
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:08,085
It says here that
there's plutonium missing...

1309
01:56:08,127 --> 01:56:11,546
from just about every
nuclear plant in this country.

1310
01:56:11,589 --> 01:56:14,883
- who's got it?
- Any asshole that wants it.

1311
01:56:14,884 --> 01:56:17,052
Man.

1312
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:21,181
That's the guy, Drew.

1313
01:56:21,182 --> 01:56:23,016
The guy
Paul is bringing to see me.

1314
01:56:23,017 --> 01:56:24,518
Who?

1315
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:26,979
The guy that wrote it,
from the "New York Times."

1316
01:56:27,021 --> 01:56:28,689
if you're going to be
in the newspaper...

1317
01:56:28,690 --> 01:56:31,024
I want to be in there, too.

1318
01:56:38,199 --> 01:56:41,702
Dolly, did you...

1319
01:56:41,703 --> 01:56:46,164
Did you tell the company
about the "New York Times"?

1320
01:56:46,207 --> 01:56:48,375
No. I don't think
I remembered that part.

1321
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:58,635
Did you tell them
about the X-rays?

1322
01:57:01,723 --> 01:57:04,933
- Dolly?
- No.

1323
01:57:04,934 --> 01:57:07,060
Are you sure?

1324
01:57:07,103 --> 01:57:10,605
Karen, they know
everything about us.

1325
01:57:19,532 --> 01:57:22,242
They don't know
about the X-rays, do they?

1326
01:58:00,823 --> 01:58:03,658
OK. That's it.

1327
01:58:32,063 --> 01:58:35,649
All right, Mr. Stephens
and Miss Pelliker.. .

1328
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:39,820
you both check out well below
permissible body limits.

1329
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:42,489
You were exposed to
Miss Silkwood and the house...

1330
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:46,451
but you show minimum
detectable activity now.

1331
01:58:48,830 --> 01:58:51,164
Miss Silkwood.

1332
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:59,172
We have detected
americium in both lungs...

1333
01:58:59,173 --> 01:59:01,007
and both sides of your chest.

1334
01:59:01,008 --> 01:59:04,427
Americium is produced
when plutonium disintegrates.

1335
01:59:04,470 --> 01:59:07,097
And extrapolating from
your americium level.. .

1336
01:59:07,098 --> 01:59:10,058
we estimate you have
an internal contamination...

1337
01:59:10,059 --> 01:59:13,520
of six nanocuries of plutonium.

1338
01:59:13,563 --> 01:59:15,897
The maximum permissible
body burden...

1339
01:59:15,898 --> 01:59:19,526
for occupational exposure
is 40 nanocuries.

1340
01:59:19,527 --> 01:59:22,904
As you can see,
you are well under that level.

1341
01:59:22,905 --> 01:59:27,868
- I'm under it.
- As well as we can determine.

1342
01:59:27,910 --> 01:59:31,121
These are very sophisticated
instruments...

1343
01:59:31,205 --> 01:59:33,915
but their accuracy may be off.. .

1344
01:59:33,916 --> 01:59:37,210
by plus or minus 300%
at this level.

1345
01:59:38,754 --> 01:59:40,797
Plus or minus 300%?

1346
01:59:40,840 --> 01:59:42,382
That's correct.

1347
01:59:42,425 --> 01:59:44,759
Then what you're saying is...

1348
01:59:44,760 --> 01:59:46,887
that the amount
of plutonium inside me...

1349
01:59:46,888 --> 01:59:50,140
could be three times less
than you even think?

1350
01:59:50,141 --> 01:59:52,934
Or three times greater.

1351
01:59:54,770 --> 01:59:59,649
But even that would be under
the maximum body burden.

1352
02:00:12,496 --> 02:00:16,166
I think you should come on
down to Oklahoma City...

1353
02:00:16,250 --> 02:00:18,793
and bring that reporter
from the "New York Times."

1354
02:00:18,794 --> 02:00:21,880
Are you ready to see him?

1355
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:23,381
I'm ready.

1356
02:00:23,424 --> 02:00:25,425
You got the documents?

1357
02:00:27,261 --> 02:00:28,678
Come on down.

1358
02:00:33,267 --> 02:00:38,063
Man, I love it here.
I love this country.

1359
02:00:38,105 --> 02:00:40,732
Wouldn't you like
to stay here forever?

1360
02:00:43,819 --> 02:00:46,446
Doctors are all goddamn liars.

1361
02:00:49,659 --> 02:00:52,953
Land's cheap there.

1362
02:00:52,954 --> 02:00:55,455
I read about this.

1363
02:00:55,456 --> 02:00:57,624
You can build yourself
a pueblo house.

1364
02:00:58,709 --> 02:01:02,212
Make it out of adobe brick,
like the Indians.

1365
02:01:02,296 --> 02:01:07,425
Mud, straw...
Comes right out of the ground.

1366
02:01:07,468 --> 02:01:10,470
Got to build a well,
but that's not too bad.

1367
02:01:10,513 --> 02:01:13,098
You get a bunch of guys
to do you a favor.

1368
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:14,516
You do them a favor.

1369
02:01:14,517 --> 02:01:17,143
It's all barter system
out there.

1370
02:01:17,144 --> 02:01:19,020
You can make the rooms
any shape.

1371
02:01:19,063 --> 02:01:20,522
You can make 'em round.

1372
02:01:20,564 --> 02:01:22,440
It's not a right-angle
kind of life.

1373
02:01:22,483 --> 02:01:23,900
Yeah.

1374
02:01:25,903 --> 02:01:28,405
Have room for your kids.

1375
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:32,575
Yeah.

1376
02:01:35,913 --> 02:01:38,164
Hell, we could have
kids of our own.

1377
02:01:41,168 --> 02:01:43,169
We love each other.

1378
02:01:49,927 --> 02:01:51,761
Why not?

1379
02:01:57,101 --> 02:01:59,394
They wouldn't...

1380
02:01:59,437 --> 02:02:01,896
They wouldn't come out right.

1381
02:02:01,939 --> 02:02:04,399
Hell, I didn't come out right.

1382
02:02:04,442 --> 02:02:06,443
You came out OK.

1383
02:02:19,373 --> 02:02:21,374
What is it?

1384
02:02:22,877 --> 02:02:24,878
Come on.

1385
02:02:25,880 --> 02:02:29,549
Come on. I don't care.

1386
02:02:31,052 --> 02:02:32,552
I know.

1387
02:02:35,556 --> 02:02:37,265
You aren't going
to contaminate me...

1388
02:02:37,308 --> 02:02:40,101
any more than I've already been.

1389
02:02:59,622 --> 02:03:02,499
I'm sorry.
I forgot to turn off the alarm.

1390
02:03:05,419 --> 02:03:07,837
I thought you weren't going in.

1391
02:03:07,880 --> 02:03:11,633
Well. .. I have to.

1392
02:03:13,886 --> 02:03:15,845
Call in sick.

1393
02:03:15,888 --> 02:03:17,847
No, I really do.

1394
02:03:17,890 --> 02:03:21,059
I really mean
you ought to call in sick.

1395
02:03:21,102 --> 02:03:23,269
Think they'll let you work?

1396
02:03:23,312 --> 02:03:24,854
There's something I got to get.

1397
02:03:24,897 --> 02:03:27,857
At the plant?
Are you wearing my shirt?

1398
02:03:27,900 --> 02:03:29,526
Huh? My shirt!

1399
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:33,071
You don't have to get up now.

1400
02:03:33,114 --> 02:03:36,366
Sweetheart, don't get
anything out of the plant.

1401
02:03:36,367 --> 02:03:38,201
If I get hung up
at the union meeting...

1402
02:03:38,244 --> 02:03:39,994
will you pick up
Paul Stone and the guy...

1403
02:03:40,037 --> 02:03:41,704
from the "New York Times"
at the airport?

1404
02:03:41,747 --> 02:03:43,373
Fuck no.

1405
02:03:43,374 --> 02:03:44,874
Come on, darling.

1406
02:03:44,917 --> 02:03:46,376
I don't know how late
this meeting will go tonight.

1407
02:03:46,377 --> 02:03:47,794
I don't want you doing that.

1408
02:03:47,795 --> 02:03:51,214
Well... I'm doing it.

1409
02:03:51,257 --> 02:03:53,716
You don't owe
the union anything.

1410
02:03:53,759 --> 02:03:55,677
Let's not fight.

1411
02:03:55,678 --> 02:03:58,263
You don't owe
the "New York Times" anything.

1412
02:03:58,305 --> 02:04:01,182
Let's not have a fight now.

1413
02:04:02,476 --> 02:04:03,476
OK?

1414
02:04:06,313 --> 02:04:07,313
OK.

1415
02:04:09,775 --> 02:04:11,776
We can always have a fight later.

1416
02:04:16,282 --> 02:04:17,282
Hey, Drew!

1417
02:04:40,973 --> 02:04:47,020
Amazing grace.

1418
02:04:47,021 --> 02:04:53,193
How sweet the sound.

1419
02:04:53,194 --> 02:04:58,072
That saved a wretch...

1420
02:04:58,115 --> 02:05:02,076
- Give me your notes.
- OK.

1421
02:05:02,119 --> 02:05:04,204
Listen, you sure you're OK?

1422
02:05:04,205 --> 02:05:05,580
I'm OK.

1423
02:05:05,581 --> 02:05:06,956
- Bye-bye!
- Bye.

1424
02:05:06,999 --> 02:05:10,293
Once was lost.

1425
02:05:10,336 --> 02:05:16,132
But now I'm found.

1426
02:05:16,175 --> 02:05:19,093
Was blind.

1427
02:05:19,136 --> 02:05:26,935
But now I see.

1428
02:05:28,479 --> 02:05:34,067
'Twas grace that taught.

1429
02:05:34,109 --> 02:05:39,489
My heart to fear.

1430
02:05:39,490 --> 02:05:47,497
And grace my fears released.

1431
02:05:49,750 --> 02:05:57,757
How precious
did that grace appear.

1432
02:06:00,594 --> 02:06:08,601
The hour I first believed.

1433
02:06:11,146 --> 02:06:19,153
Through many dangers,
toils, and snares.

1434
02:06:21,156 --> 02:06:29,163
we have already come.

1435
02:06:31,834 --> 02:06:39,841
'Twas grace that brought us
safe thus far.

1436
02:06:42,678 --> 02:06:50,685
And grace will lead us home.

1437
02:06:52,146 --> 02:07:00,111
When we've been there
ten thousand years.

1438
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:10,455
Bright-shining as the sun.

1439
02:07:12,875 --> 02:07:18,463
We've no less days.

1440
02:07:18,505 --> 02:07:23,885
To sing God's praise.

1441
02:07:23,927 --> 02:07:31,934
As when we first begun.

1442
02:07:34,229 --> 02:07:39,192
Amazing grace.

1443
02:07:39,234 --> 02:07:44,822
How sweet the sound.

1444
02:07:44,865 --> 02:07:52,872
That saved a wretch like me.

1445
02:07:55,167 --> 02:07:59,962
I once was lost.

1446
02:08:00,005 --> 02:08:05,301
But now I'm found.

1447
02:08:05,344 --> 02:08:12,266
was bound, but now I'm free
