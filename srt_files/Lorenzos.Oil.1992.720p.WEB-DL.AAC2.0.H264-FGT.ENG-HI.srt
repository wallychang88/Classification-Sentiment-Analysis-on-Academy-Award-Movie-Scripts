1
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,630
- One orange.
- (class) One orange.

2
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,010
- Chungwa moja.
- (class) Chungwa moja.

3
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,300
- Two oranges.
- Two oranges.

4
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,180
- Machungwa mawili.
- Machungwa mawili.

5
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,980
- One pineapple.
- One pineapple.

6
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,030
(Lorenzo) Omouri! Omouri!

7
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,940
Here he is,
the cleverest boy in the world.

8
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,690
- Hi, Mom.
- What's this?

9
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,280
- It's a picture.
- Oh, my goodness.

10
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,200
- And there's the Comoros.
- Of course it is.

11
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,580
- Mrs Odone, may I have a word?
- Very skilful, sweetheart.

12
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,540
- And Jupiter.
- Jupiter next to the Comoros?

13
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,870
- I'll be right there, Lorenzo.
- OK, Mommy.

14
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,920
- Is Lorenzo having problems at home?
- Not that I know of. Why?

15
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,970
Today he started throwing paints around.
He went wild, destroying other paintings.

16
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,340
- He must have been provoked.
- No, it came out of the blue.

17
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:01,930
He's normally such a terrific kid.

18
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,230
- Darling, were they teasing you?
- No.

19
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,940
- Were they touching your paints?
- No.

20
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,530
- How were they annoying you?
- They just were.

21
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:16,400
- Doing what?
- Things.

22
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:20,740
- What kind of things?
- Things that make me feel annoyed.

23
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:22,910
(bell rings)

24
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,960
- Mrs Odone...
- Another incident?

25
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,040
Yes, and today it was much worse.

26
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,670
Mrs Odone, is there
some trouble at home?

27
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,840
Why do you assume
the trouble's at home?

28
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:43,640
Because there's nothing here that
explains his behaviour. It's... disturbed.

29
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,810
(Â¶ Italian opera on radio)

30
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:55,690
(Lorenzo screaming indoors)

31
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:12,670
He does present as a hyperactive.

32
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,130
- But don't they repeat tasks endlessly?
- They perseverate, yes.

33
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:21,130
Lorenzo's activities all have a structure:
beginning, middle and end.

34
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,350
My gosh, he's learned three languages.
How could he be hyperactive?

35
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,100
I know it's hard to accept that
a gifted child may also be disturbed.

36
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,360
(woman) Lorenzo needs to be
referred to an IDP committee.

37
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,320
- What's that?
- For what?

38
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,240
Individual Disability Placement.

39
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,820
Lorenzo needs to be
in a special ed class.

40
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:45,910
Any special ed our son needs
will be provided at home.

41
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:49,910
Anyhow, it was snowing and he began
to rub my hands to warm them.

42
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,580
Uh-oh.

43
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,630
No, he then produced photos
of his wife and children.

44
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:56,630
- That old routine!
- Oh, Deirdre!

45
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,630
Had I known this was the man
I would wait ten years for...

46
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,380
- ...I'd have let you pick up the cheque.
- I did.

47
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,550
Excuse me! You did not!

48
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,720
(guests continue chattering)

49
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,700
Lorenzo's fallen off his bike
and he is really bleeding.

50
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:29,660
Sh. That's a boy.

51
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,290
Oh, such a brave boy.

52
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,500
Doing just fine, here.

53
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,290
(Mr Odone) You're going to be OK.

54
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,380
It's Christmas Day, you know.

55
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:43,840
All across the country
little boys are trying out their new bikes.

56
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,430
Hey, champ. I think you'd better
tell your folks to lighten up.

57
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:52,680
What are they gonna do when
you're playing for the Redskins?

58
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,730
The EEG is normal, the skull x-ray
is normal and the CT scan is normal.

59
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't know what to tell you.
This boy is neurologically intact.

60
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:47,530
Doctor, we spent
three years in East Africa.

61
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,240
- In the Comoros.
- We were wondering...

62
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,750
Well, if he might have
picked up some rare parasite.

63
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,620
It's possible.

64
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,630
(sudden loud classical music)

65
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,840
Lorenzo, what are you doing?

66
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,560
Lorenzo!

67
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:22,690
Sweetie? Can you hear Mommy?

68
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,360
This may be an auditory
processing difficulty.

69
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,660
The ears hear all right,
but the brain has trouble listening.

70
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:35,870
So, this means something
is affecting his brain.

71
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,540
But what? A tumour? Multiple sclerosis?

72
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:41,840
It could be any one of a dozen things.

73
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,230
Listen, my friend. I'd like you to come
and stay in the hospital for three days.

74
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:59,270
Your mom and dad can come too.

75
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,440
We're gonna run some tests
and get to the bottom of this.

76
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:11,070
Can you hear the sound?

77
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:15,490
Keep your eyes right on that spot
for me. That helps me out.

78
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,790
All right. Now close your eyes.

79
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:35,970
Keep your eyes closed, buddy.
Stay nice and still.

80
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,740
(choir singing hymn)

81
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:27,380
Of course, Easter festivals
existed long before baby Jesus.

82
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,590
In pagan times, they marked
the beginning of Spring.

83
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:35,930
The egg tells us that the earth is going to
be reborn, just like a little baby chick.

84
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,800
- I get it.
- Mrs Odone. Mr Odone.

85
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,390
Dr Judalon is ready now.

86
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:45,230
Hey, Lorenzo, would you like
to go feed the goldfish?

87
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,980
It's all right, sweetheart. Go ahead.

88
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:52,150
We'll be right back
in just a few minutes. Go ahead.

89
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,320
This way, please.

90
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,580
Please, have a seat.

91
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,920
(air conditioning rattles)

92
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:19,260
Well, we certainly don't need
that noise, do we?

93
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,560
So...

94
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,570
Please, Doctor, without equivocation.

95
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:39,320
There is a family of diseases.
It's quite rare.

96
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,830
The leukodystrophies.

97
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:45,250
Lorenzo has one of them.
It's called ALD.

98
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,130
ALD is an inborn error of metabolism
that causes a degeneration of the brain.

99
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:58,090
It only affects males, usually
between the ages of five and ten.

100
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:03,100
Its progress is relentless.
The end is inevitable.

101
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:08,850
All boys with ALD die, usually
within two years of diagnosis.

102
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:20,910
And there are no exceptions?

103
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:24,120
I am so sorry.

104
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,710
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Yes.

105
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,290
Lorenzo shows the definitive sign:

106
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:39,630
...an abnormally high level of fat in his
blood, certain long-chain saturated fats.

107
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,350
Oh.

108
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,600
Uh...

109
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:51,770
These fats... destroy his brain?

110
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,150
But how?

111
00:15:57,110 --> 00:16:00,110
There is an enzyme
that should metabolise these fats...

112
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,490
...but in ALD boys it's defective.

113
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:08,500
So they collect in the nerve cells, a
little bit like a cluster on the arteries.

114
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,580
And... in some way...

115
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:16,670
...this liquefies
the white matter of the brain.

116
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:20,510
"Some way liquefies"?
Could you be more specific?

117
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,970
Well, to be honest, we're not
quite certain just how it works.

118
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:28,640
- You know what myelin is?
- No.

119
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,600
Myelin is the fatty... sheath
that insulates the nerves.

120
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,110
It's a little bit like plastic
around electrical wires.

121
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,780
Without it, the nerves
cannot conduct an impulse.

122
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:46,030
What ALD does is strip away the myelin.
It corrodes it, if you like.

123
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,950
This causes degeneration of the brain
and the body loses its functions.

124
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,960
But surely someone, somewhere,
must be working on this, no?

125
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,300
- We would go anywhere.
- Yes.

126
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,970
Ten years ago the disease
hadn't even been identified.

127
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,640
We're still trying to
understand just what it is.

128
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,530
I would like to
offer you some hope, but...

129
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,200
Then there's absolutely no treatment?

130
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,700
Normally at this point
we try to be constructive.

131
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:36,000
We try to focus on what can be done.

132
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,170
But in this case...

133
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:42,110
When we get home, can we read a story?

134
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,230
Of course, my darling.

135
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,950
Lorenzino, let's go home.

136
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:51,240
(sobs)

137
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:25,900
(phone rings)

138
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,610
(woman) Mr Odone? I have
a Dr Judalon on line three.

139
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,150
- Good. Put him through.
- They're waiting for you in the meeting.

140
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,110
All right, thank you.

141
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,530
- Hello?
- Augusto?

142
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:38,200
I just got off the phone
to Gus Nikolais...

143
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:41,750
...a professor of neurology at
the Institute of Childhood Diseases.

144
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:48,340
If there is a so-called "world expert"
on the leukodystrophies, Nikolais is it.

145
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,840
- Ah, good.
- I don't want to raise false hopes...

146
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,680
...but he's working on
an experimental protocol based on a diet.

147
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,300
Wonderful.

148
00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:00,260
(Lorenzo breathes with difficulty)

149
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:12,780
Peanut butter, red meat, cheese...

150
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,610
Unpeeled fruit, spinach, olive oil...
But these are healthy foods.

151
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,910
Yes, but they contain
very long-chain saturated fats.

152
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,040
I...

153
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,960
I still do not understand why
they are so harmful to Lorenzo.

154
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,000
- Why are they so destructive?
- How can spinach make the difference?

155
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:36,720
The human body needs these fats
in order to create cells...

156
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,680
...and the excess is burned off.
That's normally, of course.

157
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,930
But in the case of an ALD boy,
these saturates can't be broken down...

158
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,100
...and they build up in the brain.

159
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:52,650
And somehow this build-up
strips the myelin covering.

160
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,940
Yes, exactly. And, for the moment,
we don't know why this is.

161
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:00,200
But we feel that, by withdrawing
the saturated fats from the diet...

162
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,780
...we will prevent them
accumulating in the brain.

163
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:04,450
And if we could?

164
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,540
There's no way to reverse
neurological damage.

165
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:11,790
All we can hope for is
to slow the cascade of symptoms.

166
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,170
But if it's any consolation to you,
you'll be helping us...

167
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:19,680
...understand the biochemistry
of this heartless disease.

168
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,470
So, can we enrol Lorenzo in our trial?

169
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:30,850
I suppose so.

170
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:36,780
Good. Then I will pass you
over to our dietician...

171
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,700
...and meanwhile we should arrange
some genetic counselling.

172
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,580
Oh, Dr Nikolais, it's highly unlikely
that we will have another child.

173
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,040
No, but your sisters and their daughters
may all be carriers.

174
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,630
- We need to test them.
- Only my family? What about his?

175
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:57,260
No, no. ALD is passed
only through the mother.

176
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,430
But I thought you understood all this.

177
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,770
We knew it was inborn, but...

178
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,940
...we assumed that meant
a combination of our genes.

179
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,520
That's true in other inherited diseases...

180
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,150
...but ALD is only carried
on the female chromosome.

181
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
Excuse me.

182
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,870
Are you saying that Lorenzo
got this directly from me?

183
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,500
Well, in the sense that
ALD is sex-linked, yes.

184
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,000
It goes from mother to son.

185
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,130
- And how did I get it?
- The woman gets it from her mother.

186
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:41,590
And if I inherited the defect,
why don't I have the disease?

187
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,220
No, the woman is only
the carrier, nothing else.

188
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:51,100
But with each conception, she has
a 50-50 chance of passing on the defect.

189
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,900
And when that happens...

190
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,360
It's the cruellest kind of genetic lottery.

191
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,990
- Lottery?
- Yes, a clumsy word.

192
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,280
I use it because it's...
so arbitrary, you know.

193
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:06,660
- No one is to blame.
- Um...

194
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,620
If Michaela's mother had this...

195
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,170
...and her mother's mother...

196
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,250
...why was there no warning?

197
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,260
Well, I suppose if you went back
into the family tree, you'd...

198
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,800
But remember, a short time ago
this disease didn't even have a name.

199
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,350
Mrs Odone, you have enough
to put up with without...

200
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,940
You have nothing to blame yourself for.

201
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,940
Thank you.

202
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:50,870
(Deirdre) It's not a good idea.

203
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:55,960
All right, so she doesn't want me. What
about Mother? She's packed and ready.

204
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,290
Kenise, Michaela doesn't
want anybody around.

205
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,760
What about Father Killian? He can come.

206
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,170
Hell, no. She's not even
going to Mass now.

207
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,340
- Deirdre, what is happening there?
- Just let it rest, OK?

208
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:09,850
No. What will they do
for Lorenzo's birthday?

209
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:12,310
- I'll call you. Bye.
- No. Deirdre!

210
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:17,150
This is wrong. More than ever
she needs her family here.

211
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,940
She doesn't want nobody.
She's too angry.

212
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,190
We cannot afford the time to be angry.

213
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,490
Come on, look what she's dealing with.

214
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,700
She does not have to deal with it alone.

215
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,990
She feels incredibly alone and unlucky,
like she's been singled out by God.

216
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:35,210
- Oh, Deirdre!
- Yes! Kenise is a carrier with two girls.

217
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,710
Me, a carrier with no kids at all, and
Mariah has a boy but she's not a carrier.

218
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
So only Michaela gets this laid on her.

219
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,430
- This did not happen only to Michaela.
- Sure. You got two kids already, Odone.

220
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,760
Mommy will make you something better:

221
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:53,390
...a big-boy fruit treat
with five different colours.

222
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:06,700
She waited all this time to have one
child. She's not gonna have another.

223
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,010
(knock on door)

224
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,930
Francesco! Cristina!

225
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:37,020
- Ah, buongiorno.
- Oh, Francesco!

226
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,380
- Cristina.
- Michaela.

227
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,800
Ciao.

228
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:24,190
Everyone, this is Lorenzo's sister
and brother, all the way from Rome.

229
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,320
This does not make sense.

230
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,400
Lorenzo's saturated fats have risen.

231
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:17,660
We eliminate them from his diet,
and in his blood they increase.

232
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,210
If these very long-chain saturated fats
are destroying his mind...

233
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,880
...then surely we should
take him off the diet.

234
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,340
(Nikolais) Mr Odone, please be patient.

235
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:33,300
Your son has been on the diet only six
weeks. Wait until the end of the trial.

236
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:38,260
Dr Nikolais, what about the other boys?
What results are you seeing in them?

237
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,270
As with Lorenzo, it's too early to tell.

238
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,980
We need the study to run
for the full six months.

239
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:47,560
That will tell you what
is obvious right now...

240
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,360
...that avoiding apple skins and pizza
has no effect on this brutal disease.

241
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:58,910
Now, please, Doctor, is there anyone out
there who is chasing a definitive therapy?

242
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,790
You judge us too hastily. The French
have tried bone-marrow transplants...

243
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:07,500
...and in Boston we're about
to try immunosuppression.

244
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,630
- Why haven't we heard of these before?
- The transplants were disastrous...

245
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,880
...and the immunosuppression
is highly experimental.

246
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,510
The protocol has been limited
to six boys...

247
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,060
...all more profoundly
afflicted than your son.

248
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,810
For God's sake! How afflicted
does he need to be?

249
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,150
It's a school, Lorenzo,
like any other school.

250
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:33,440
- And it's full of doctors?
- Yes. Some of the cleverest in America.

251
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,240
- What colour is that cross?
- Red.

252
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,370
That's right. It's red.

253
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:45,080
I'll speak to your parents for a second.
Leah's gonna take your blood pressure.

254
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,210
I'll be right back.

255
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:50,040
(Leah) I'll just put this around your arm.

256
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:54,050
You've had this done before, haven't you?

257
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Look, it's important you both
know exactly what's going on.

258
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:02,930
Cyclophosphides are no picnic.
This is chemotherapy.

259
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:07,270
We're gonna be suppressing
his immune system. It's very high-risk.

260
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:11,020
We'll need to keep him here
at least three weeks.

261
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:14,690
Now, Lorenzo is still walking,
talking and communicating.

262
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,110
But that could all change.

263
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,370
Now, knowing all this, do you
still want us to go ahead with it?

264
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,830
Given the alternatives, yes.

265
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,680
The faculty is very grateful
to Lorenzo for doing this.

266
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,990
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Lorenzo
Odone, whom I've spoken to you about.

267
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:02,200
Now, young Mr Odone,
you need to come with me.

268
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,250
You are getting so big!

269
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:13,040
Now, I'm gonna put you up here
so we can all see you, OK?

270
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,670
Attaboy.

271
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,300
Ten weeks after diagnosis
we observe hemianopia...

272
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,720
...with transient horizontal nystagmus.

273
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,390
The pupillary light reflexes
are still intact...

274
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:26,470
...and, as yet, there's no optic atrophy.

275
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:30,140
However, there is evidence of
early occipital-lobe involvement.

276
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:34,860
(drawn-out) Why are all
these people here?

277
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,860
- I beg your pardon, Lorenzo?
- Why are all these people here?

278
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:43,660
He asks why all these people are here.

279
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:48,120
Well, they're all doctors...

280
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:51,330
...and they want to learn
how to help other boys in the future.

281
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,960
Other boys with the boo-boo?

282
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,710
- Yes, darling.
- Mm-hm.

283
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,340
Thank you, Lorenzo.

284
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:07,350
Now, in the scanning speech,
we look for both ends of the pathology:

285
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:11,770
...centrally for the dysphasia,
and peripherally for the dysarthria.

286
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,360
Now, Lorenzo, would you
walk for me, please?

287
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,650
Attaboy.

288
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,570
That's right. Hold my hands.

289
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,740
That's right.

290
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,910
Two months ago there was simply motor
lag. Now note the characteristic gait.

291
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,840
It's due mostly to hyperreflexia, but
exacerbated by the encroaching paresis.

292
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:40,760
You're doing very well. Keep coming.

293
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,640
Only if you stop talking like that.

294
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:23,970
Hello, Mr Odone. Have I got that right?

295
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,840
- (on phone) Odo-ne.
- Odo-ne? I'm sorry.

296
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,810
Ellard Muscatine.
I'm with the ALD Foundation.

297
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:34,230
We heard about your boy Lorenzo,
and we'd like to offer you some help.

298
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,270
You're a doctor?

299
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:41,440
Doctor? Heck, no. I'm a machinist from
Allequippa, PA, but I'm an ALD parent.

300
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:47,200
This is my second time around, so I know
exactly what you're going through.

301
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,040
My wife Loretta and I,
we run the foundation.

302
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,370
We organise counselling,
conduct seminars, fund research.

303
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,000
We have 500 member families,
not only American...

304
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,340
...but from Portugal,
Israel, Japan, Australia...

305
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:07,300
And we're growing all the time.

306
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:11,430
We wanted you and Mrs Odone
to know that you're not alone.

307
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,690
Hi. Ellard Muscatine.
Welcome to the conference.

308
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:26,200
- Augusto Odone.
- Michaela.

309
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,200
Oh, very nice to meet you.
Please come in.

310
00:35:30,410 --> 00:35:33,330
This is my wife Loretta,
and these are the Odones.

311
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:36,160
Great. I'm so happy
you were able to come.

312
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:39,580
Because I think a lot of it is denial.

313
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:43,920
We don't want to say anything's going
on. We're strong and we can handle it.

314
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,680
But this is the place and
this is the time to let it all out...

315
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,050
...let the barriers come down...

316
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,430
...and to share your feelings
and get it off your chest.

317
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,270
It's hard to believe that
things can get worse.

318
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,110
But they will.

319
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,360
One thing nobody wants to
talk about is what happens...

320
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:10,450
...or does not happen, between
the two of you in the bedroom.

321
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:12,700
A whole year
we couldn't touch each other.

322
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,000
My husband stood by me all the way
but, oh my, does it test the men!

323
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:21,250
- And the weak ones just up and go.
- Even the strong ones leave.

324
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:25,960
My guy hung in there when our first boy
took sick. Then we had little Jake tested.

325
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:29,380
Arlen wanted a whole bunch of boys,
a whole ball team.

326
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:33,140
He's gonna have 'em too...
with some other gal.

327
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,640
(Loretta) We'd like to thank the parents...

328
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:40,810
...who gave so generously to the fund
for the immunosuppression trial.

329
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,310
The doctors have said that
this experiment contributed greatly...

330
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,940
...to the understanding of ALD.

331
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:51,450
Betty and Tom Knowles,
$250 in memory of Corey.

332
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:55,660
Dr and Mrs Liebowitz,
$500 in memory of Joel.

333
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,750
Mr and Mrs Higgins,
$1,000 in memory of Adrian and Julian.

334
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,840
26 people have sent in
recipes for the newsletter.

335
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,630
Now, we still need ideas for
snack foods and breakfast treats.

336
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,720
Remember, all recipes should be
low-fat...

337
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,970
...and use only the foods
allowed on the institute diet.

338
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,220
- Excuse me.
- Yes, ma'am?

339
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:19,560
Our son has complied with this diet...

340
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:24,810
...but his levels of saturated C24 and
C26 have risen for two months in a row.

341
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:27,320
That's exactly what's happened to Jaybird.

342
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,280
Ah, well, perhaps before we talk
about publishing cookbooks...

343
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:36,410
...we should ask ourselves
if the diet is working at all.

344
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:41,000
- Shouldn't we?
- Damn right we should.

345
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,170
This is not the way we do things here.

346
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,210
But there are two families here
with this paradox. Maybe there are more.

347
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,420
Shouldn't we open it for discussion?

348
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:54,010
- My boy's levels are rising.
- Now there are three families.

349
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:57,890
So maybe we should...
Could we have a show of hands?

350
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,350
Then we'll see how many
families there are.

351
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,770
You don't understand. This is a formal
pilot study. It has to run for six months.

352
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,810
We're not scientists.
We don't interpret experiments.

353
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,780
That's the solemn
responsibility of the doctors.

354
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,240
Come on, Ellard!
Let's have a show of hands.

355
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,450
No, that would be misleading.

356
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:18,870
The medical folks call
this kind of evidence anecdotal.

357
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,370
- What's wrong with a show of hands?
- It wouldn't have any meaning.

358
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,290
- Excuse me. May I say something?
- Sure.

359
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,840
The only way that the doctors can get
useful results is with a strict protocol...

360
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,720
...and statistical samples
in a control group.

361
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,590
And a proper time frame.
Doctors have to be careful.

362
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,970
Clinical trials must withstand
a tremendous amount of scrutiny.

363
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,770
This is the way that
medical science works.

364
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:46,600
That's the only way the scientists
can get the information they need.

365
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:52,900
So what you're saying is that our children
are in the service of medical science.

366
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:55,030
How foolish of me. I always assumed...

367
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,030
...that medical science
was in the service of the sufferers.

368
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,240
Yes. Uh, thank you.

369
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,710
Uh, now I think it's time
we get back to our agenda.

370
00:39:04,830 --> 00:39:10,540
Why? So we can discuss further salvaging
our marriages and managing our grief?

371
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:15,300
What about the children?
No one here is discussing the children.

372
00:39:16,550 --> 00:39:18,840
Thank you.

373
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:23,430
Now if Mary has nothing further to add,
I would like to introduce Dr Chapel...

374
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,440
...to talk about the nasogastric tube
and suction machine.

375
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,060
Would you all join me
in giving him a very warm welcome?

376
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:32,230
(applause)

377
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,240
Thank you, Madam President.
Thank you, Ellard. Ladies and gentlemen...

378
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,840
(Â¶ classical music)

379
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,930
- (Lorenzo) Now hold my hand.
- Yes, sweetie.

380
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:26,080
- Now the story.
- What story is that, sweetheart?

381
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:30,540
La notte di San Lorenzo.

382
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,460
San Lorenzo, who is...?

383
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,800
(drawls) My patron saint.

384
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,170
And saint of my father's village.

385
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:41,050
That's right. And what happened to him?

386
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:43,640
He was in Rome.

387
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,810
Mm-hm.

388
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,310
And... I forgot.

389
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,020
Well, many years ago...

390
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:58,820
...the bad guy says to him
"Bring us the riches of your church."

391
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:05,990
And Lorenzo, he brings them
the beggars and the sick people...

392
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:11,160
- ...and he says...
- (drawls) "These are our riches."

393
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,710
Yes!

394
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:17,500
- Bravo, Lorenzo, bravo.
- That's wonderful, sweetheart. So clever.

395
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:20,420
And tonight, August 10th, is...

396
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,930
La notte di San Lorenzo.

397
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,930
(Michaela) The night
of the shooting stars.

398
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,520
(Augusto) When anything can happen.

399
00:41:58,130 --> 00:41:59,590
Micha...

400
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,760
Sh, sh, sh.

401
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:06,970
When we first went to the Comoros,
what did we do?

402
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,350
- We got to know the country, right?
- Yes.

403
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,900
We studied. We got to know
the language, resources, its laws.

404
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,070
We studied, right?

405
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,110
We should treat Lorenzo's illness
like another country.

406
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:26,200
- I don't quite see the analogy.
- All right, all right.

407
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,120
- ALD has many dimensions, right?
- Yes.

408
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:35,290
So in order to understand it, we need
a command of genetics, biochemistry...

409
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,630
...microbiology, neurology, ology-ology...

410
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,380
Augusto, we don't have time
to go to medical school.

411
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:45,720
Michaela, the doctors are in the dark.
They're groping in the dark.

412
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,300
They've got Lorenzo
on a turvy-topsy diet.

413
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:54,690
And that bloody immunosuppression
is brutal and useless.

414
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:59,770
Michaela, we should not have
consigned him blindly into their hands.

415
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:04,030
He should not suffer by our ignorance.

416
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,450
We take responsibility.
So... we read a little.

417
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:12,120
And we go out and inform ourselves.

418
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:18,330
But... to miss time with him
while he can still speak to us...

419
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,750
Yes, I know, I know.
But he expects it of us.

420
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,720
I want to take Lorenzo off the diet.

421
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:16,560
He's been eating cardboard for 19 weeks,
and what's it getting us?

422
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:21,150
- And feed him what?
- Normal foods. Things a child likes.

423
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:24,530
Full of the long-chain fats
that we know destroy his myelin?

424
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:28,610
Look. On the diet,
his blood fats are still rising.

425
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,370
- Yes, I know, Michaela.
- It doesn't make any sense.

426
00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,580
But we don't know enough.
We don't know enough.

427
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,000
We don't know it clearly enough.

428
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,460
Here, Michaela,
let me show you something.

429
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,630
All right, here.

430
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,800
Un piccolo acquaio.

431
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,670
- A kitchen sink?
- Yes, yes. Little kitchen sink.

432
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,140
All right. Now here is the tap. Mm-hm?

433
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,260
And here's the sink basin
and the plughole, right?

434
00:44:55,390 --> 00:45:01,140
All right. Very long-chain saturated fats
are introduced by what we eat, right?

435
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:03,900
- Yes?
- Now, also produced by the body...

436
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,650
...or manufactured by the body,
these very same fats.

437
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,530
- Biosynthesis.
- Biosynthesis, right.

438
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:12,910
Now, normally they are not harmful...

439
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:17,830
...because this enzyme
eliminate the excess, right?

440
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,130
But in Lorenzo, this enzyme
is defective from genetics.

441
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:26,420
His plughole is blocked, right?

442
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,630
Yes.

443
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:32,260
We know that very long-chain saturated
fats are made up of carbon atoms.

444
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,600
C2, 4, 6, 8...
all the way up the chain, right?

445
00:45:36,470 --> 00:45:42,980
But in Lorenzo,
the saturated C24 and C26...

446
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:46,520
...rise to four times the normal level.

447
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:53,610
OK, now, here's where we have
a little paradox, a mystery, OK?

448
00:45:54,950 --> 00:46:00,040
Why, when we reduce the dietary intake
of saturated fats...

449
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:05,330
...does the level in our sink, which
we would expect to go down, go up?

450
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,710
So, logically, we should
take him off the diet.

451
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,130
Well, Michaela...

452
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:15,260
...just as logically, we should not.

453
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:17,850
Because let's not do
what the doctors did.

454
00:46:17,970 --> 00:46:20,810
Let's not act without knowing why.

455
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:27,020
Why, when we turn off this tap,
does the level in our sink rise?

456
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,530
I married a plumber.

457
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:36,570
You married a man with a simple mind,
who asks simple questions, that's all.

458
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,830
Here, Michaela. Brain food.

459
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:41,250
- Come on.
- Oh. Thank you.

460
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:44,390
Polish rats! I think I have
an explanation for the paradox.

461
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,980
Lorenzo, kiss your clever mother.

462
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:53,360
Polish rats with a fatty-acid storage
disease. Let me use your kitchen sink.

463
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:59,070
Here's our tap for what we eat.

464
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:03,540
And here's our tap for biosynthesis.

465
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,870
I see. Biosynthesis. Mm-hm.

466
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,790
When the rats were deprived
of a specific fat in their diet...

467
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,840
...their body cells compensated
by overproducing it.

468
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:19,340
- So if this holds true for humans...
- Then the diet is useless...

469
00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:23,600
...unless we can stop it overproducing,
slow down biosynthesis, sÃ¬?

470
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,270
Yes, and there's more. And for this,
I deserve two kisses, my darling.

471
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,820
In the summary, it talks about
the concept of fatty-acid manipulation.

472
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,860
- What's that?
- Well...

473
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,910
...they stop the rats
producing one kind of fat...

474
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:43,780
...by loading their diet with another kind.

475
00:48:43,910 --> 00:48:48,830
So maybe we could stop Lorenzo's body
from producing C24 and C26...

476
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,290
...by loading his diet with another kind
of fat, one that's less harmful.

477
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,300
We should have this translated
as soon as possible.

478
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:59,510
I have some news too.

479
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:01,840
It's a letter from Omouri.

480
00:49:01,970 --> 00:49:05,220
He wouldn't open it until you got home.

481
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,810
- Omouri.
- Yes.

482
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:15,860
Michaela, by tomorrow morning...

483
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,110
...your Polish rats will be
speaking to us in English. Hm?

484
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,950
(Michaela) I've been thinking.

485
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:30,250
I found that article by accident.
I just as easily could have missed it.

486
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:35,130
It was written by a Polish biochemist,
who I'm sure knew nothing about ALD.

487
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,420
Well, Michaela, still it gives us
a new line of inquiry.

488
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:42,430
Yes, but it could take months.

489
00:49:42,590 --> 00:49:46,510
And there will be other leads that take
more time, and it's time we don't have.

490
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:53,440
All these experts, working in isolation,
each one on his own piece of the jigsaw.

491
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:00,280
Of course, a symposium is the best way
to accelerate the exchange of information.

492
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,530
In that sense,
it's a very good idea, Mr Odone.

493
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,870
Only... May I say something?

494
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:11,330
Have you any idea how many children
in the United States die every year...

495
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,420
...from choking on French fries?

496
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:19,000
Many more than from
adrenoleukodystrophy.

497
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:21,630
Ours is what is known as
an orphan disease.

498
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,720
It's too small to be noticed,
too small to be funded...

499
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:29,390
...especially with the iron hand
of Reaganomics.

500
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:34,980
So while, as I say, this remains a very
good idea, it's a luxury we can't afford.

501
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:39,480
Well, we appreciate that,
so we have prepared a budget...

502
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:42,030
...based on 40 participants for two days.

503
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:46,530
We think it can be done for $35,000.
My wife and I will raise the money.

504
00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,990
- We can't ask you to bear the cost.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

505
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,750
That's the least of our concern.

506
00:50:52,870 --> 00:50:56,080
And of course, your institute
will not be at risk...

507
00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:00,920
...because the Odones
will underwrite any shortfall.

508
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:06,050
And we took the liberty
of drafting an invitation list.

509
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,810
Forgive me, Dr Nikolais.
We wish to make two conditions.

510
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:14,230
We would like the symposium
to emphasise therapy...

511
00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:19,570
...and Michaela and myself would like
to participate in the discussion.

512
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,200
Martha, I'm afraid we'll have to
add to your workload...

513
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:36,160
...but it's in a very good cause.

514
00:51:36,290 --> 00:51:40,540
We've decided to convene
the first symposium on ALD.

515
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,380
We should notify the Muscatines.

516
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:48,090
Of course. The foundation could
help with the arrangement.

517
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:52,680
They could even, perhaps...
find some funds.

518
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,850
How about we hook it to the back of
the next Foundation Family Conference?

519
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:02,070
- (Michaela) When would that be?
- Next summer. 4th of July.

520
00:52:02,230 --> 00:52:05,150
- That's nine months away!
- It will take us all that time...

521
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,030
...to invite those busy doctors
and raise the money.

522
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:11,450
- I don't think so.
- What's your time frame, Mrs Odone?

523
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:14,950
- Five weeks from now. November 10th.
- That's not possible.

524
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,790
Oh, I think it is.

525
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:19,080
Pardon me,
but what is the point of rushing?

526
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,710
As ALD parents, we both know
the answer to that inane question.

527
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:29,010
If you want this to happen,
you're going about it the wrong way.

528
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:32,010
- At least we are going about it.
- (Lorenzo drawls)

529
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:35,060
- Sorry, I don't understand.
- He wants his diaper changed.

530
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,480
- (dialling tone)
- Mrs Muscatine, look... Hello?

531
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,400
Hello?

532
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,530
They should be hung by their eyelashes.

533
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:47,150
- They won't help?
- It doesn't look that way.

534
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,320
- Good boy. I'll take him.
- No, I got it.

535
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:52,370
- What'll you do? Mortgage the house?
- Not until I have to.

536
00:52:52,490 --> 00:52:53,950
Michaela!

537
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,130
I've spent two months pulling
on the heartstrings of Washington...

538
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,890
...to raise money for multiple sclerosis,
sudden infant death and cystic fibrosis.

539
00:53:12,010 --> 00:53:14,220
Then why exclude adrenoleukodystrophy?

540
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:18,430
Because I also cover politics,
the arts, women's issues and stuff...

541
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,350
...and my readership likes
to have a little balance.

542
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,230
I cannot do another medical story
right now. Maybe in another month.

543
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:30,700
Joyce, I think you should meet my son.

544
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:37,290
My friends...

545
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,580
This is so generous.

546
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:44,670
You know, Augusto, our wives
are eager to form a committee...

547
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:48,550
- ...to, perhaps, help with hospitality.
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.

548
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:55,050
Not only will we be saving money,
but they'll be extremely well fed.

549
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:59,180
For breakfast, French pastry, correct?
Lunch, UN finger food.

550
00:53:59,350 --> 00:54:02,480
- (knock on door)
- The British will do afternoon tea.

551
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,190
And for dinner, I know
a marvellous Italian cook.

552
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:13,490
Are you needin' another pair of hands? I'll
lick envelopes, serve coffee, whatever.

553
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:17,410
And this is for your boy. I grow
the best organic produce in Virginia.

554
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:20,410
- Thank you.
- You don't remember me!

555
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,830
Wendy Gimble. Foundation Family
Conference. I yelled louder than you.

556
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,420
- Yes, of course. You have two boys.
- We lost Jaybird, but Jake here is fine.

557
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,630
We think what you're doing is fantastic.

558
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,010
Hello, Jake. Come on in. Thank you.

559
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:40,180
When I read about what you were doing,
I thought "It's time we did something."

560
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,060
- Please, come in and meet the others.
- Is that Lorenzo?

561
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:48,440
Yes. Lorenzo, this is Jake.
He's a young man of your age.

562
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:53,360
Look, Lorenzo, a great big pumpkin.
Let's go down and feel how big it is.

563
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,160
(Lorenzo drawls)

564
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:00,160
- What, sweetheart?
- (drawls)

565
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:05,870
I'm sorry, Lorenzo.
Let's try that again.

566
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,090
(drawls, shouting)

567
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:31,650
This morning I could still understand him.

568
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,870
(man) When we can clone the ALD gene,
we can identify the deficient enzyme...

569
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:46,370
...mass-produce the gene,
implant it into ALD sufferers...

570
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,630
- ...and normalise their metabolism.
- (Augusto) How long would that take?

571
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:57,550
Seven to ten years.

572
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:00,550
You see, science has its own time...

573
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:04,220
...and, very often, any new advance
can be a matter of serendipity.

574
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:08,150
(Nikolais) For the last six months, all
our ALD boys have been on a regimen...

575
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:12,480
...which excludes saturated C24 and 26.

576
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,200
But despite this restriction
in the diet...

577
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:20,530
...these long-chain fatty acids
have remained the same...

578
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:23,540
...in some cases even increasing.

579
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:29,710
Now, this compensating increase
I put down to biosynthesis.

580
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:33,170
But, Gus, if you could maintain the diet...

581
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:36,970
...and somehow inhibit biosynthesis,
you'd have a therapy.

582
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,550
No, you wouldn't quite have a therapy.

583
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,760
You would have a way of
lowering the fatty acids to normal.

584
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:45,930
(speaks Japanese)

585
00:56:51,690 --> 00:56:55,150
If you wish to inhibit biosynthesis...

586
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,950
...have you considered
fatty-acid manipulation?

587
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:01,990
(speaks Japanese)

588
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:13,500
There is some literature,
a rat study, Russian or Polish.

589
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,460
(Michaela) Polish. Straszak.
I have copies right here.

590
00:57:16,590 --> 00:57:20,800
Polish Journal of Biological Sciences
1979, Volume II.

591
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:25,220
They loaded the diet with one fat
and decreased biosynthesis of another.

592
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:28,310
Yes, I remember this article.

593
00:57:28,430 --> 00:57:33,520
And also in Canada, they have seen
the same thing in miniature swine.

594
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:36,940
(man) As a matter of fact,
I've seen it in human cells.

595
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:39,110
In human ALD cells.

596
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:43,990
From patients with ALD,
I took fibroblasts - skin cells, OK?

597
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,290
Each one carries the same genetic defect.

598
00:57:46,450 --> 00:57:51,250
I incubated them with oleic acid and
reduced the saturated C24 and C26...

599
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:54,000
- ...by more than 50 per cent.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

600
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,840
You said oleic acid?

601
00:57:57,250 --> 00:58:00,550
Yes, monounsaturated C18,
the main component of olive oil.

602
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:04,050
- Surely this is the basis for a therapy.
- (man) Slow down.

603
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:08,270
These are studies in cultured cells. We
don't know it'll work in a human being.

604
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:12,480
Well, then, take the olive oil
and try it in a patient and see...

605
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:17,440
Augusto, olive oil is forbidden
in the diet: C24, C26.

606
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:21,400
Yes, but then use whatever
Dr Rizzo fed his fibroblast.

607
00:58:21,530 --> 00:58:26,620
Pure oleic acid would be very toxic to
an intact organism, an animal or human.

608
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:31,580
It would need to be the triglyceride form,
which is edible, but that's not available.

609
00:58:31,710 --> 00:58:36,420
All right, can't you take ordinary
olive oil and extract the C24 and C26?

610
00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:41,510
You could, but it's a very complicated
procedure and would be very expensive...

611
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:44,890
...especially to produce the quantities
for a clinical trial.

612
00:58:45,010 --> 00:58:47,220
Have you contacted chemical companies?

613
00:58:47,350 --> 00:58:49,390
No one will tool up for that.

614
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:54,060
Not for an experiment,
not for something with no market.

615
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:56,650
- Then you haven't tried?
- No.

616
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:06,990
If we were able to get triglyceride,
then we can change all that, right?

617
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:10,040
Yes. It has to be triglyceride
to be edible.

618
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,250
(Michaela) Edible form. Triglyceride.

619
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,370
(man on phone)
No one here can help you.

620
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:16,880
Then do you know anyone else who does?

621
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:19,250
I'll send you back to the switchboard.

622
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:23,550
- (telephonist) Which extension, please?
- Research and development.

623
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:24,680
(woman) R&D.

624
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,050
- I need a triglyceride form of oleic acid.
- Your name, Doctor?

625
00:59:28,180 --> 00:59:30,600
- No, I'm not a doctor.
- Are you with a company?

626
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,060
No, I am not with any company.
I'm the mother of a sick child.

627
00:59:34,230 --> 00:59:35,560
- A mother?
- That's right.

628
00:59:35,690 --> 00:59:37,440
- And you want...?
- Oleic acid.

629
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,190
- The lines are busy.
- I'll wait.

630
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:42,690
Papa makes you
spaghetti al pomodoro...

631
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:47,610
...seasoned with basilico,
the royal herb for our prince.

632
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,280
Badabib, badabab, badaboom.

633
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,710
Come on, Lorenzo, take a little bit.
That's a boy.

634
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,380
(Michaela) The best lead
came from the symposium:

635
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,880
...oleic acid in the triglyceride form.
Now it's our only hope for Lorenzo.

636
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:06,760
(woman) Don't fret, Mrs Odone.
You will hear from him within the hour.

637
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,600
- You can be sure of it.
- Thank you. That's 301...

638
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,640
Don't worry, I have the number.

639
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,060
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome. Bye-bye.

640
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:25,280
So, as the swallowing reflexes weaken,
he's less able to handle his own saliva.

641
01:00:26,070 --> 01:00:31,120
We'll all have to be pretty vigilant. We
really have to stay on top of this thing.

642
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:36,160
If we allow any saliva to get down into
his respiratory tract, we block his airway.

643
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,370
- (phone rings)
- We don't wanna do that.

644
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,630
Here we go. Put your
thumb over the valve.

645
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:43,250
When you don't want suction,
release your thumb.

646
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,930
Hi. It's ProtoChem again.
I'll connect you to our Mr Pellerman.

647
01:00:55,270 --> 01:00:59,310
- I believe you want some oleic acid.
- Yes, in triglyceride form.

648
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,650
You're lucky. We're testing a glycerol
trioleate here as an industrial lubricant.

649
01:01:03,770 --> 01:01:07,150
Industrial? Then... is it fit
for human consumption?

650
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,490
I don't see why not.
It's a purified olive oil.

651
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:14,830
Without saturates? Pure monounsaturated
C18 in triglyceride form?

652
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,620
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're sure?

653
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,960
It happens we have one bottle here,
sitting idle on the shelf.

654
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:23,290
Marvellous! How can we
get our hands on it?

655
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:25,840
- Sorry. Go ahead.
- How can we get our hands on it?

656
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,300
This is... beautiful.

657
01:01:30,090 --> 01:01:33,890
- And it's entirely harmless?
- Gus, you're talking to an Italian.

658
01:01:34,010 --> 01:01:38,600
- It's only olive oil.
- Yes, that's harmless. It's like... sugar.

659
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,560
And yet, to a diabetic,
sugar can be lethal.

660
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:46,780
You see, the trouble is we don't know to
what extent Lorenzo can metabolise fats.

661
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:52,200
Yes, well, Gus, it's been seven months
since Lorenzo was diagnosed.

662
01:01:52,320 --> 01:01:54,990
Now he is silent. He's immobile.

663
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:58,120
Augusto, I am a scientist...

664
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:01,580
...and I'm of absolutely
no use to you whatever...

665
01:02:01,710 --> 01:02:04,130
...unless I can maintain my objectivity.

666
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,550
And I am not a scientist. I am a father.

667
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:12,300
And nobody can tell me what dressing
I put on my kid's salad, OK?

668
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,810
Augusto...

669
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:21,060
This science of medicine.
You know, it's not like physics.

670
01:02:21,190 --> 01:02:24,440
There's no mathematical certainty.

671
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:30,400
And because we deal with human beings
who suffer, it can appear heartless.

672
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,610
I know.

673
01:02:37,030 --> 01:02:41,370
You realise that any collaboration
of mine would have to be unofficial?

674
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:45,920
SÃ¬, sÃ¬, of course. Now, the dose.
We think 40 grams a day.

675
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,090
- That's too much. Say 30.
- 30?

676
01:02:49,210 --> 01:02:53,130
Yes. Any more than that
might damage your son's liver.

677
01:02:53,260 --> 01:02:55,510
Darling, they're about to start.

678
01:02:58,350 --> 01:03:02,640
We're going to send this blood away
to establish a baseline, my brave boy.

679
01:03:02,770 --> 01:03:06,980
Because today we all start
the fight against the boo-boo.

680
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,530
There. All done.

681
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:16,950
Lorenzino, this year we celebrate
Thanksgiving a little early...

682
01:03:17,070 --> 01:03:21,200
...with a fine barracuda
like we used to eat in the Comoros, huh?

683
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:24,920
And Papa has cooked it
with the aromatic dill.

684
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:27,080
And now...

685
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:32,970
...we add the special olive oil
which Mama found.

686
01:03:33,090 --> 01:03:35,130
Hm? All right?

687
01:03:37,090 --> 01:03:39,100
There we go.

688
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:40,890
Deirdre.

689
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:44,020
All right, Lorenzo. Here we go.

690
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:14,970
- There we go.
- You did good, buddy boy. Real good.

691
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:19,550
Your Aunt Deirdre means "well", darling.
In this house, we cherish our adverbs.

692
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:23,350
I expect you to do the same
when you get your voice back.

693
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:00,970
(phone rings)

694
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,180
- Hello?
- Mrs Odone, this is Dr Nikolais's office.

695
01:05:07,310 --> 01:05:11,860
I have Lorenzo's results. There's been a
small drop in the saturated C24 and 26.

696
01:05:11,980 --> 01:05:14,110
- About 15 per cent.
- 15 per cent?

697
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:18,650
Dr Nikolais said not to get carried away.
It could be a spontaneous variation.

698
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:22,740
- Am I allowed a tiny squeak of joy?
- We'll know more next month.

699
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:24,080
Thank you.

700
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:47,310
(choking)

701
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,140
Michaela!

702
01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:54,190
(Lorenzo gasps for breath)

703
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:59,030
Augusto! Get something
to hold down his tongue!

704
01:05:59,150 --> 01:06:01,150
- (Lorenzo wails)
- Oh, my baby!

705
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:13,500
So, this is a kind of seizure,
like epilepsy?

706
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:18,210
No, not a seizure. It's a paroxysm.
It's triggered by saliva in the windpipe.

707
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:20,630
- But we suction him.
- Regularly.

708
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:23,800
I know, but even so, some saliva
gets caught in the trachea.

709
01:06:23,930 --> 01:06:26,810
In any other child,
a cough would get rid of it.

710
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:29,810
In Lorenzo, it becomes
a scrambled chain of reflexes...

711
01:06:29,930 --> 01:06:33,190
...that amplifies into
what you have just seen.

712
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:36,110
If this happens again,
what can we do about it?

713
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,480
Just help him try to ride it out.

714
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:42,910
We're all flying blind here, folks.
The best I can offer is sedation.

715
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:48,870
But if it's not epilepsy, then he's aware
of what's happening while it's going on?

716
01:06:48,990 --> 01:06:51,040
Well, it's possible.

717
01:06:51,790 --> 01:06:55,880
And if he has another episode,
we could talk him through it.

718
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:58,130
It's possible, Michaela.

719
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,340
It's possible.

720
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:06,220
- SÃ¬, sÃ¬. A 50 per cent drop, right?
- That's correct.

721
01:07:06,350 --> 01:07:08,220
Thank you very much. Thank you!

722
01:07:08,390 --> 01:07:10,640
Fantastico! Fantastico!

723
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:26,450
I very well understand that we are not
scientists, but we have observed this...

724
01:07:26,570 --> 01:07:31,080
(Nikolais) Let us do it our way,
Augusto. Trust us.

725
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,290
- I've got to go.
- OK. Thank you.

726
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,870
Goodbye.

727
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,290
- Nikolais says it's very interesting.
- Interesting? A 50 per cent drop?

728
01:07:39,420 --> 01:07:43,170
But it's too early to draw a conclusion.
Rizzo might consider a trial.

729
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:46,550
And he asked us
not to tell the other parents.

730
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,350
- What?!
- It's immoral. Something finally...

731
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:52,980
- The parents have to know.
- We'll tell them. They can judge.

732
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:56,730
- The foundation has a mailing list.
- We'll call the Muscatines.

733
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:59,940
I can eat crow
in the name of a good cause.

734
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:04,860
Michaela...

735
01:08:07,820 --> 01:08:12,490
Mm! Delicious! That was worth
driving 300 miles for.

736
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:16,540
- Now, my friends... dessert.
- Here, let me move this.

737
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:20,540
And Loretta... a little science, hm?

738
01:08:21,380 --> 01:08:23,420
Thank you.

739
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:26,380
"Dear ALD parents..."

740
01:08:35,310 --> 01:08:39,520
- You want us to send this out?
- Yes. We'll pay for copying and postage.

741
01:08:40,190 --> 01:08:42,230
But you're advocating a therapy.

742
01:08:42,360 --> 01:08:46,860
No, we're merely reporting
a positive advancement in the diet.

743
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,620
It would be wrong to keep it
from the other parents.

744
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:53,830
Mrs Odone, we have an advisory board
of eminent doctors...

745
01:08:53,950 --> 01:08:56,080
...and we take our guidance from them.

746
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:58,580
They are the ones
with the medical degrees.

747
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:02,590
Yes, my dear, but Nikolais
already knows about this...

748
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:07,170
- ...and the wretched man does nothing.
- Because he is a responsible scientist.

749
01:09:07,300 --> 01:09:12,010
- No, because he has another agenda.
- All right, Michaela. Calmati, calmati.

750
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:14,560
You know, Loretta, sometimes...

751
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:21,480
...the interest of the scientists is not
the same as the interest of the parents.

752
01:09:21,610 --> 01:09:25,730
Scientists are human
and sometimes they can be wrong.

753
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:31,320
As president of the foundation,
you represent us, the families.

754
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:36,410
And you serve the families best
by informing them.

755
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:41,920
And all we ask is that you please
send this letter to them, that's all.

756
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:47,880
Our parents suffer enough without
being made the victims of false hopes.

757
01:09:48,010 --> 01:09:52,220
We can't give credence to every jerk
with a pocketful of apricot seeds.

758
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:56,310
Excuse me, this is not Laetrile. We're
talking about an extract of olive oil...

759
01:09:56,470 --> 01:09:59,890
...an idea that was put forth
by the scientists at the symposium.

760
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:02,060
And it works in Lorenzo.

761
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:05,730
It works in an ALD boy
to a degree that is significant.

762
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:10,740
- Very significant.
- Other parents have a right to know.

763
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,660
We know that this is a deadly disease,
so they have a right to choice.

764
01:10:15,830 --> 01:10:19,710
And if they feel as we do,
they can put pressure on the doctors.

765
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:24,670
Because, as parents, we should
challenge these guys. We push them.

766
01:10:24,790 --> 01:10:31,760
Unless someone is willing to question,
to provoke, how would there be progress?

767
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:33,840
Well, we feel there is progress.

768
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:38,890
Loretta, we know that, but all we say is
start a dialectic with the doctors.

769
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:40,890
Are you telling us what to do?

770
01:10:41,020 --> 01:10:43,350
We're asking you
to disseminate information.

771
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:46,900
You gonna teach the doctors?
Where we come from, that's arrogance.

772
01:10:47,020 --> 01:10:49,320
- Arrogance!
- Yes.

773
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,740
It is... arrogance.

774
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:56,990
It comes from the Latin word... arrogare.

775
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:00,120
You know it? You know
the root? What it means?

776
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:03,870
It means to claim for oneself.

777
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,130
That's the root.
It means to claim for oneself.

778
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:13,630
And I claim the right
to fight for my kid's life.

779
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:19,470
And no doctor, no researcher, no bloody
foundation, has the right to stop me...

780
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,850
...from asking questions
which might help me save him!

781
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:27,560
And you have no right to stop
the sharing of information!

782
01:11:27,690 --> 01:11:30,940
- So you think about it!
- Our job is to be there for the parents.

783
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,490
To comfort them,
not to get them stirred up.

784
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:37,780
If the doctors think you have something,
they will tell us in their own good time.

785
01:11:37,910 --> 01:11:41,950
- Their own good time is not our time.
- What? They are so powerful...

786
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,330
They are so powerful
that you would be silent?

787
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,290
They are not gods!

788
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,840
Do you know, this acquiescence
is so disgusting!

789
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:53,470
You think you know so much.
Let me tell you something!

790
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:57,300
When Michael got sick, we looked for
anything that might help him.

791
01:11:57,430 --> 01:12:00,310
And the best thing that happened?
He was taken quickly.

792
01:12:00,430 --> 01:12:04,100
Now, Tommy... he has lasted three years.

793
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:07,150
For two of 'em, he's been
without his sight, his mind...

794
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,400
...everything that makes him
a human being. He's a vegetable!

795
01:12:13,570 --> 01:12:18,490
Oh, boy! If you would stop all this denial,
you wouldn't do a thing...

796
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:23,580
...to prolong your boy's suffering
and indignity one minute longer.

797
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:37,090
Has it occurred to you that maybe
he doesn't want to be around any more?

798
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,800
SÃ¬, sÃ¬. Thank you.

799
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:50,690
It has to be a mistake.

800
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:53,940
No, Nikolais says not.

801
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,320
- Augusto...
- Oh, sorry.

802
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:02,240
- Should we risk raising the dose?
- No, he's too fragile.

803
01:13:02,370 --> 01:13:04,790
Any more might harm his liver.

804
01:13:16,220 --> 01:13:18,260
(bell rings)

805
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:32,610
- (Lorenzo screaming)
- Lorenzo, listen to Mommy.

806
01:13:32,730 --> 01:13:35,690
You're going to have to be brave
as only you know how.

807
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,360
We're gonna count together,
you and I, all right?

808
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:41,990
Listen to Mommy's voice
and the boo-boo will let go of you.

809
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,160
One, two...

810
01:13:44,830 --> 01:13:47,040
...three, four...

811
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:09,890
Michaela...

812
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,820
You know, I've been a nurse for 18 years,
eight of them spent in ICU paediatrics.

813
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:21,070
And I know that you can't always
play by the rules, but...

814
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:23,070
...this boy shouldn't be at home.

815
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:27,620
He should be placed
in a properly equipped hospital.

816
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:31,420
Why don't you say what you mean?

817
01:14:31,540 --> 01:14:34,250
I'm not comfortable with this situation.

818
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:40,420
Well, Lorenzo and I aren't comfortable
with your lack of comfort.

819
01:14:41,630 --> 01:14:44,470
I can't continue to be a party to this.

820
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:48,640
I gotta give you my notice.
I'll stay until...

821
01:14:48,810 --> 01:14:51,640
- No, you should finish tonight.
- Michaela! Go easy.

822
01:14:51,770 --> 01:14:55,610
Your agency will receive
a cheque in the morning.

823
01:14:55,770 --> 01:14:59,360
Look, Ruth. We're all
a little strung-out here.

824
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:04,160
She's talking about placement, Deirdre.
It's a euphemism for "hospice".

825
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,450
Lorenzo has enough to endure. We will
not expose ourself to doubt and despair.

826
01:15:08,580 --> 01:15:11,290
She's exhausted. That's all it is.

827
01:15:11,410 --> 01:15:15,580
Look, I don't know.
Somebody had to say something.

828
01:15:15,710 --> 01:15:17,750
Good luck.

829
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:15,390
Buonasera, Odone.

830
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,730
Look what I found.

831
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:20,400
Look at this. Would you look at this!

832
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:24,360
Let me show you.

833
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,570
Where are we? Right here.

834
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:35,370
That was June of '83, just 21 months ago.

835
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:46,970
You know, it's time you guys
take it easy on yourselves.

836
01:16:47,090 --> 01:16:49,140
Deirdre...

837
01:16:50,510 --> 01:16:53,770
If we knew why it only work halfway...

838
01:16:55,640 --> 01:16:58,940
...then we might know what to do next.

839
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:03,530
Augusto, how many mornings
have I found you asleep...

840
01:17:03,650 --> 01:17:07,150
...under a pile of research papers
with the lights still on?

841
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:10,780
And then you wake up
and drag yourself into the office.

842
01:17:10,910 --> 01:17:12,870
How long can you keep this up?

843
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:16,250
If you get sick - and you will -
what are you gonna do for money?

844
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:20,000
What are you telling me?
For God's sake, he is my kid.

845
01:17:20,130 --> 01:17:26,130
Yeah, so are Cristina and Francesco, and
it's been a year since you've seen them.

846
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:28,300
Listen to me, OK?

847
01:17:30,590 --> 01:17:34,100
There has to be a life beyond Lorenzo.

848
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,440
What are you telling me?
That I should give up on this now?

849
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,270
Oh, man. We both know that even if
you get his levels down to normal...

850
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:44,480
...his brain can't fix itself.

851
01:17:44,610 --> 01:17:48,280
How much myelin does he have left?
Do you ever ask yourself that?

852
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:52,780
- Deirdre, now that's enough.
- No. Don't bullshit me.

853
01:17:52,910 --> 01:17:56,410
I know you do... but she doesn't.

854
01:17:57,910 --> 01:17:59,960
Not ever.

855
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:05,880
You have to help me with her.
She doesn't eat, she doesn't sleep.

856
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,050
I'm afraid for her.
I think she's losing it.

857
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,930
You've seen how she is with him.
She just can't let him go.

858
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:18,100
Poor Deirdre.

859
01:18:18,850 --> 01:18:22,270
Spoken as only a woman who's
never had a child could speak.

860
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,400
Michaela, Deirdre was
speaking out of love.

861
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,990
I am only telling you what I see.

862
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:32,110
For both your sakes,
there has to be life beyond Lorenzo.

863
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:38,000
Do you think that he has no voice?
No will to live? He asserts it through us!

864
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:40,710
If you can't see that,
there's no place for you here!

865
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:44,170
Michaela, for God's sake,
she is your sister!

866
01:18:44,290 --> 01:18:49,210
- And I think you're losing it, Michaela.
- Well, then, I think you should go.

867
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:53,720
Augusto, help her pack her bags.
I'm going back to our son.

868
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:00,560
You think I'm crazy
because I speak for our son?!

869
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:17,160
I am so sorry.
I never wanted this to happen.

870
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:22,830
How can I? How can I enjoy
anything when he enjoys nothing?

871
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,840
How can you talk to me about loving him
when you trivialise him into...

872
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,760
No! No!

873
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,820
- Mrs Odone!
- Get a tube.

874
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:56,620
Do you have the tube?

875
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:59,580
Don't nod, Nancy Jo. Say "yes".
My attention's on Lorenzo.

876
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:03,120
Darling, look at me. Listen to
Mommy's voice. We're gonna count.

877
01:20:03,290 --> 01:20:06,170
- One, two, three, four...
- (Lorenzo screaming)

878
01:20:10,630 --> 01:20:12,670
(choking and crying)

879
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:28,310
I'm sedating him as much as I dare.
I don't know what else to do.

880
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:43,040
How can he endure this
for so many hours?

881
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,620
Augusto...

882
01:20:48,580 --> 01:20:52,500
I don't think he'll have to
endure it much longer.

883
01:20:53,010 --> 01:20:54,720
(screaming)

884
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,770
(choking and panting)

885
01:21:24,910 --> 01:21:28,290
Michaela, let me take him.

886
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,790
- You need rest.
- I'm fine.

887
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:34,050
I could use a cup of coffee, though.

888
01:21:43,220 --> 01:21:45,770
Lorenzo... Lorenzo, listen to Mama.

889
01:21:46,730 --> 01:21:48,850
Can you hear me, my darling?

890
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:51,690
If this is too much for you,
my sweetheart...

891
01:21:51,810 --> 01:21:56,490
...well then you fly, you fly
as fast as you can to baby Jesus.

892
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:01,370
It's OK.

893
01:22:03,370 --> 01:22:05,620
Mama and Papa will be OK.

894
01:22:06,330 --> 01:22:08,370
(wailing)

895
01:22:44,910 --> 01:22:48,620
I have rarely seen anything
like this boy's tenacity.

896
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,000
They have a bed available upstairs.

897
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:58,590
No, no, no. In a hospice, no.

898
01:22:59,550 --> 01:23:01,470
It'd be easier. On everybody.

899
01:23:01,590 --> 01:23:04,430
But I would not do honour to Lorenzo.

900
01:23:23,240 --> 01:23:25,370
Michaela. Come.

901
01:23:25,490 --> 01:23:27,950
- What?
- Come. Come on.

902
01:23:28,120 --> 01:23:30,160
- Nurse.
- Yes.

903
01:23:40,050 --> 01:23:43,970
Now, today we eat, moglie mia,
every last mouthful.

904
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:46,260
- I'm not hungry.
- No, no, no. You eat.

905
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:47,470
Sit.

906
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,720
Michaela, you sit. Sit.

907
01:23:50,850 --> 01:23:55,270
From tomorrow morning,
the Odones need all their energies.

908
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:59,940
Now listen. We set out to
normalise Lorenzo's blood, right?

909
01:24:00,070 --> 01:24:06,070
And with the oleic oil, we got it
half-right, but that was luck.

910
01:24:06,200 --> 01:24:11,160
- It was rather more than luck.
- No, it was luck. Merely observation.

911
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:14,290
Rizzo observed something
in a test tube, right?

912
01:24:14,410 --> 01:24:16,580
We tried it on Lorenzo.

913
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:20,130
Rizzo observed
a 50 per cent drop in fibroblasts.

914
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:23,340
We observed
a 50 per cent drop in Lorenzo.

915
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:28,970
Michaela, that is luck.
That is observation.

916
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:33,430
That is all it is.
It is not understanding.

917
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:37,020
And until we understand
why this work only halfway...

918
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:41,070
...how can we expect
to succeed all the way?

919
01:24:41,230 --> 01:24:45,780
I need to understand, Michaela.
You need to understand.

920
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:49,950
So, tomorrow we go back to the library.

921
01:24:50,700 --> 01:24:55,750
No, no, no. We review all the literature,
everything on fatty-acid metabolism...

922
01:24:55,870 --> 01:24:58,420
...every word published in the last decade.

923
01:24:58,540 --> 01:25:00,880
So, eat. You eat.

924
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,340
Whatever energy or time I have left
I want to spend with Lorenzo.

925
01:25:04,460 --> 01:25:07,180
You will not have to leave him.
I will go to the library.

926
01:25:07,300 --> 01:25:09,680
I make copies for you,
I bring it home for you.

927
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,560
Augusto, we are on our second mortgage.
You can't afford not to go to work.

928
01:25:13,680 --> 01:25:17,190
Michaela, I will work.
I'll fit it in somehow.

929
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,400
Michaela, this is important. I need you.

930
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:27,030
I need you, Michaela.

931
01:25:28,780 --> 01:25:30,530
So eat.

932
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:53,060
Brava! Bravissima! Bravissima!

933
01:26:00,730 --> 01:26:02,810
(sighs)

934
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,200
Betty! Betty!

935
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:22,420
All these fatty-acid studies concentrate
on the middle of the chain...

936
01:26:22,540 --> 01:26:26,380
...because the medium-chain saturates
are implicated in cholesterol.

937
01:26:26,510 --> 01:26:30,010
So what do these researchers do?
Think cholesterol, cholesterol.

938
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:33,260
C12. C14, C-bloody-16!

939
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:36,770
- Augusto, what are you looking for?
- I am looking...

940
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:41,230
- ...for the long end of fatty-acid chains!
- All right. Write it down for me.

941
01:26:41,350 --> 01:26:44,480
These researchers should be
doing something about this.

942
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:46,980
- Write it down.
- Long-chain fatty acids.

943
01:26:47,110 --> 01:26:50,860
C18 through C26.

944
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:53,320
Saturated.

945
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:55,870
Monounsaturated, OK?

946
01:26:55,990 --> 01:26:59,120
OK. Now I want you to go off to lunch.

947
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:03,380
Have yourself a good lunch
and I'm gonna see what I can do.

948
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:16,260
This is the best I could do
at short notice.

949
01:27:16,390 --> 01:27:19,980
One article from a veterinary
science journal about pigs.

950
01:27:20,100 --> 01:27:24,350
- But it's on your long-chain fats.
- Well, thank you, Betty.

951
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,480
Listen, I am very sorry about...

952
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:30,490
Oh, well, you're Italian.

953
01:27:34,490 --> 01:27:39,040
- (coughing and wheezing)
- (Michaela) ..72, 73, 74...

954
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:43,370
That's it. 75, 76...

955
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:47,590
...77, 78...

956
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,420
Nice going, Mrs Odone.

957
01:27:51,510 --> 01:27:55,550
That's it, my love. You know
only the strongest, bravest boy...

958
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:59,430
...only a very special person
like you is chosen to fight the boo-boo.

959
01:27:59,560 --> 01:28:02,140
I'll give him a little water, OK? 20cc's?

960
01:28:02,270 --> 01:28:03,350
Yes.

961
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:08,610
And, Nancy Jo, why don't you tell Lorenzo
what an excellent job he did?

962
01:28:08,730 --> 01:28:11,070
An excellent job you did, Lorenzo.

963
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:16,620
Sometimes I wonder, my love, if people
realise how incredible you truly are.

964
01:28:26,290 --> 01:28:28,840
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

965
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:32,710
Is this a new hobby or a nervous tic?

966
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:38,800
No, this is a simple mind at work,
that's all.

967
01:28:38,930 --> 01:28:43,310
See, each paperclip, Deirdre,
is two carbon atom, right?

968
01:28:43,430 --> 01:28:45,140
- Oh, God!
- No, no, no.

969
01:28:45,270 --> 01:28:47,600
Really is two carbon atom, all right?

970
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:51,530
So we have C2, C4, C6, you know?

971
01:28:51,690 --> 01:28:54,700
Now, here's what I try to do.
I try to make a chain...

972
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:58,780
...a very long chain
of monounsaturated fats.

973
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:02,540
- This is the good guys, right?
- OK, what are these? The bad guys?

974
01:29:02,660 --> 01:29:05,210
Yes. These here...

975
01:29:05,330 --> 01:29:07,960
...is the bad guys, all right?

976
01:29:08,080 --> 01:29:10,210
Now, Deirdre, what I'm trying to do...

977
01:29:10,340 --> 01:29:12,750
I try to understand the relationship...

978
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:15,970
...between the good guys
and the bad guys.

979
01:29:16,340 --> 01:29:19,260
So, OK, I am the enzyme, right?

980
01:29:19,390 --> 01:29:24,810
And I reach out and grab a carbon atom
and I put it on my chain, right?

981
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:26,390
Here is my chain.

982
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,310
Now, here, you be
the bad-guy enzyme, OK?

983
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:33,190
No, no. Do this for me.
You be bad-guy enzyme, all right?

984
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:34,820
Take this, all right?

985
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:40,160
Now you reach out and grab a carbon
atom and put it on your bad-guy chain.

986
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,700
I had enough trouble
with the kitchen sink.

987
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:47,660
No, no. You just do this and
then I explain, OK? All right.

988
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:53,500
So let's each start now
making our chains.

989
01:29:53,630 --> 01:29:58,180
OK? All right? Do another one.
That's good, Deirdre.

990
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:00,430
Good. We put another one on...

991
01:30:00,550 --> 01:30:04,390
- Here's the stuff on enzyme complexes.
- Ah, thank you. Mille grazie.

992
01:30:04,520 --> 01:30:06,430
- Prego.
- Prego! Very good.

993
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:09,020
- Now, did you make the extra copies?
- Oh, you bet.

994
01:30:09,140 --> 01:30:11,610
- Thank you very much.
- For Michaela? How is she?

995
01:30:11,730 --> 01:30:13,190
She's fine.

996
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:17,950
So here we are. We're making our chains
more or less the same rate, right?

997
01:30:18,070 --> 01:30:20,280
That's as one would expect, right?

998
01:30:20,410 --> 01:30:23,700
But, now, Deirdre, if we were enzymes...

999
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:27,410
...in the bodies of little rats
and little pigs and Lorenzo...

1000
01:30:27,540 --> 01:30:31,460
...then the faster I go,
the more you slow down.

1001
01:30:32,330 --> 01:30:34,710
Now, why would that be?

1002
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:40,590
Why, the faster I go, would you slow
down, if we are both separate enzymes?

1003
01:30:40,760 --> 01:30:45,640
It means that there has to be
some kind of relationship going on.

1004
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:50,190
We affect each other some way.
There's some kind of interplay.

1005
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,900
But what is it?

1006
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:55,110
What is it?

1007
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,650
(Michaela) One, two...

1008
01:31:01,410 --> 01:31:03,820
...three, four...

1009
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:07,410
...five, six...

1010
01:31:07,950 --> 01:31:09,620
...seven candles.

1011
01:31:09,750 --> 01:31:12,580
And Mommy will blow them out for you.

1012
01:31:12,710 --> 01:31:14,750
Make a wish.

1013
01:31:32,190 --> 01:31:34,230
(Lorenzo murmurs)

1014
01:31:41,070 --> 01:31:44,160
(Lorenzo recites random numbers
in Italian)

1015
01:31:55,250 --> 01:31:58,090
Michaela! They are the same enzyme!

1016
01:31:58,210 --> 01:32:03,340
There is one enzyme for both chains.
It's the same bloody enzyme!

1017
01:32:03,470 --> 01:32:07,050
So if we keep the enzyme busy
making monounsaturates...

1018
01:32:07,180 --> 01:32:09,770
It distracts it from
elongating the saturates.

1019
01:32:09,890 --> 01:32:12,560
Right! So we have a way to trick nature.

1020
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,810
Yes, it's a principle called
"competitive inhibition".

1021
01:32:15,940 --> 01:32:19,190
So, Gus, do you think
it's a reasonable hypothesis?

1022
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:23,740
I think it's more. You've clarified
the biochemical pathway.

1023
01:32:23,860 --> 01:32:26,620
Augusto, I really want
to congratulate you.

1024
01:32:26,780 --> 01:32:31,200
This would explain why oleic acid
is only partly successful.

1025
01:32:31,330 --> 01:32:35,170
Yes, it's C18, you see.
It's too low down in the chain.

1026
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:39,710
So we add a second barrier. We block
the bad guys further up the chain...

1027
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:44,130
...the saturates further up the chain,
between C22 and C24.

1028
01:32:44,260 --> 01:32:46,510
There we stop
the bloody things completely.

1029
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:50,430
- And how would you do that?
- By adding monounsaturated C22.

1030
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,350
- That's erucic acid.
- Yes, exactly.

1031
01:32:54,020 --> 01:32:56,060
Erm...

1032
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:58,020
- Martha?
- Yes, Doctor?

1033
01:32:58,190 --> 01:33:03,440
Among our animal studies,
you will find a file on erucic acid.

1034
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:06,360
With an e... r-u-c-i-c.

1035
01:33:06,530 --> 01:33:08,570
- OK.
- Thank you.

1036
01:33:09,490 --> 01:33:12,080
You don't believe it will work?

1037
01:33:12,200 --> 01:33:17,540
I think what you have done is postulate a
theory that could be of enormous benefit.

1038
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,300
But, as for erucic acid,
it creates cardiac problems in rats.

1039
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:26,930
If it's not safe for rats, I don't know
what justification there can be...

1040
01:33:27,050 --> 01:33:31,050
...for using it as a therapy on humans.

1041
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,020
But Gus, Gus...

1042
01:33:33,140 --> 01:33:37,100
...erucic acid is the chief component
in rapeseed oil, right?

1043
01:33:37,230 --> 01:33:40,770
Rapeseed oil is a common food
in China and India.

1044
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:43,900
And their rate of heart disease
is far lower than here.

1045
01:33:44,030 --> 01:33:47,820
All right, look at these documents.
Cardiac lipidosis...

1046
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:52,240
...myocardial lesions, cholesterol
deposits in the adrenal gland...

1047
01:33:52,370 --> 01:33:55,370
...and damage to the reproductive system.

1048
01:33:55,500 --> 01:33:59,210
I'm afraid the weight of evidence
is much too great.

1049
01:33:59,330 --> 01:34:01,960
And no human-studies
review committee...

1050
01:34:02,090 --> 01:34:06,300
...will ever do anything but discard
erucic acid out of hand.

1051
01:34:06,510 --> 01:34:10,890
But the human studies
have been accomplished by history.

1052
01:34:11,010 --> 01:34:15,470
They have been eating the stuff
in these countries for thousands of years.

1053
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:19,560
You can't expect me to start a protocol
based on that kind of assertion.

1054
01:34:19,690 --> 01:34:21,940
You should examine your protocol...

1055
01:34:22,060 --> 01:34:25,730
...when children are dying and
find a way to research these...

1056
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:29,820
- It's common sense.
- We simply have a contradiction.

1057
01:34:29,990 --> 01:34:33,910
We seek more information. We do not
dismiss erucic acid out of hand.

1058
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:38,540
Michaela, if I ignore all this evidence...

1059
01:34:38,660 --> 01:34:42,500
...and we embark on a therapy
based on erucic acid...

1060
01:34:44,250 --> 01:34:47,260
Something goes wrong. What then?

1061
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,390
Well, then I suppose the risk-reward
ratio is too unattractive for you.

1062
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:55,100
I beg your pardon?

1063
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:59,770
The life of one boy
is not enough reward for you...

1064
01:34:59,890 --> 01:35:05,150
...to risk the reputation of the
institution and the esteem of your peers.

1065
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:12,450
That was uncalled for. Your responsibility
is merely towards your own child.

1066
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:17,620
My responsibility is towards all the boys
that suffer from this disease...

1067
01:35:17,740 --> 01:35:19,910
...now and in the future.

1068
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:24,540
Of course I anguish for
the suffering of your boy.

1069
01:35:25,380 --> 01:35:30,010
And of course I applaud you for
the efforts you make on his behalf.

1070
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:33,970
But I will have nothing to do
with this oil.

1071
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:40,310
We are not asking, Doctor,
for your anguish or your applause.

1072
01:35:40,430 --> 01:35:43,520
We are asking merely for a little courage.

1073
01:35:48,690 --> 01:35:50,740
OK. All right.

1074
01:35:55,660 --> 01:36:01,330
(Augusto) No, whatever the doctors say,
reason tells us it is a risk worth taking.

1075
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:05,750
But, my friend, we need
a sympathetic collaborator, hm?

1076
01:36:05,880 --> 01:36:09,380
If it was in my hands, I would do
anything I could to help, Mr Odone.

1077
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:11,550
I have a boy of my own.

1078
01:36:12,420 --> 01:36:14,430
But I don't like our chances.

1079
01:36:14,550 --> 01:36:19,470
You know, they said the same thing
about the oleic acid, and here it was...

1080
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:23,350
- ...sitting right on the shelf.
- This is a whole other ball game.

1081
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:27,610
Extracting the saturated C24 and 26
from rapeseed oil...

1082
01:36:27,730 --> 01:36:30,980
It's very tricky. It would take
our best chemist at least a year.

1083
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:36,780
And then you would never get it past the
FDA. Erucic acid for human consumption?

1084
01:36:36,910 --> 01:36:41,120
I'm sorry, but no one in the country
is gonna touch it.

1085
01:36:41,250 --> 01:36:44,620
Well, what about
outside this country, hm?

1086
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,880
Uh, I wouldn't know where to send you.

1087
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,920
Oh, Mr Pellerman! We're agents
for over a dozen foreign companies.

1088
01:36:52,050 --> 01:36:54,010
There must be one that could help.

1089
01:36:54,130 --> 01:36:57,390
Maybe all we need to do is look
at the list of the foreign companies.

1090
01:36:57,510 --> 01:37:00,560
No, you and your wife
have enough to do.

1091
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:05,440
I'm sure Mr Pellerman would be happy
to make the calls for you.

1092
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,360
We'd have to be covered, legally.

1093
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:15,860
If anything goes wrong, this company
is not going to be held liable.

1094
01:37:16,030 --> 01:37:19,240
Oh, we would not hold you liable. No, no.

1095
01:37:19,370 --> 01:37:25,370
And this... It would be greatly
appreciated if we could circulate this.

1096
01:37:30,040 --> 01:37:35,010
"The interplay of monounsaturated
and saturated fatty acids:

1097
01:37:35,130 --> 01:37:38,300
...therapeutic application in ALD."

1098
01:37:38,430 --> 01:37:39,970
- Wow.
- You wrote this?

1099
01:37:40,100 --> 01:37:43,770
Yes. We felt that
if we were asking for help...

1100
01:37:43,890 --> 01:37:47,230
...our rationale needs to be very clear.

1101
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:52,980
(Yorkshireman) We've all read your paper.
It's a beautiful piece of biochemistry.

1102
01:37:53,110 --> 01:37:56,360
(Augusto) Over a hundred companies
all say "too difficult".

1103
01:37:56,490 --> 01:38:00,070
Well, my first impression
was that it's bloody impossible.

1104
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:04,040
But I've been doing difficult
fractionations for 40 years...

1105
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:07,920
- ...and I'd like to have a stab at it.
- How long do you think, Mr Suddaby?

1106
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:11,920
I've only six months
before I retire, so we'll see.

1107
01:38:12,040 --> 01:38:17,220
All right. Then I'll let you get on with
it. Call me if you have any questions.

1108
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:19,380
Righto. Bye, then.

1109
01:38:39,110 --> 01:38:41,160
(knock on door)

1110
01:38:41,740 --> 01:38:43,780
Who could this be?

1111
01:38:47,540 --> 01:38:49,870
Ah, your good friend Wendy...

1112
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,840
...with all sorts of lovely
vegetables and fruits.

1113
01:38:54,550 --> 01:38:56,550
- Hi, Michaela.
- Look what you brought us!

1114
01:38:56,710 --> 01:38:58,590
Hi, Lorenzo.

1115
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,720
Jake's not in school today?

1116
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:02,930
He's not feeling so good.

1117
01:39:05,350 --> 01:39:09,730
I'm going for a walk with Mrs Gimble
and we shall be back shortly.

1118
01:39:09,890 --> 01:39:13,310
I've given him his oxcarbazepine
and 15ml of water.

1119
01:39:14,190 --> 01:39:18,190
- Do you want me to do anything else?
- I'm sure he would love a story.

1120
01:39:18,320 --> 01:39:20,780
Do you have a problem with this?

1121
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,160
Fine.

1122
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:35,340
- He's had a couple of tantrums.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1123
01:39:35,500 --> 01:39:37,550
It's OK.

1124
01:39:38,420 --> 01:39:42,550
- Dr Rizzo got him in the oleic acid trial.
- That's good.

1125
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:49,980
Hi, Jake.

1126
01:39:51,480 --> 01:39:54,650
Hi, sweetie.
Thank you for my potatoes.

1127
01:39:57,020 --> 01:39:59,070
Say hello, son.

1128
01:40:01,820 --> 01:40:04,320
(weakly) Hi, Mrs...

1129
01:40:04,450 --> 01:40:07,530
...Odone.

1130
01:40:16,960 --> 01:40:20,050
He saw the way Jaybird went.

1131
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,380
He knows what's in store for him.

1132
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:32,350
(flatly) "They forgot their hunger
and followed the bird."

1133
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:34,520
"They came to an opening in the forest."

1134
01:40:34,650 --> 01:40:39,020
"Before them was a little cottage,
gleaming in the rays of the setting sun."

1135
01:40:39,150 --> 01:40:43,110
"'Look, Gretel' exclaimed Hansel.
'That cottage is made of gingerbread."'

1136
01:40:43,240 --> 01:40:46,570
"'It really is' replied Gretel,
running up and tasting a bit...

1137
01:40:46,740 --> 01:40:48,660
...that she had pulled from the wall."

1138
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,370
"'And the roof is shingled
with butterscotch."'

1139
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:55,580
"'The windowsills are made of chocolate'
declared Hansel, breaking off a bit."

1140
01:40:55,710 --> 01:40:59,340
"'The windowpanes are clear candy'
said Gretel. At that moment..."

1141
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:03,090
Nancy Jo, do you think you could muster
just a tad more enthusiasm?

1142
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,180
Lorenzo loves words.
He loves the sound of language.

1143
01:41:06,300 --> 01:41:09,720
Well, I'm paid to nurse,
not read stories.

1144
01:41:10,600 --> 01:41:14,060
You've decided his mind doesn't need
as much nurturing as his body?

1145
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,270
What mind?

1146
01:41:16,850 --> 01:41:18,900
I beg your pardon!

1147
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:22,530
Nothing.

1148
01:41:22,650 --> 01:41:24,740
Get out.

1149
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:27,450
- Look, Mrs Odone...
- Just get out.

1150
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:30,990
I've read up on this disease!
I know what it's done to his brain!

1151
01:41:31,120 --> 01:41:34,870
Sh! Lorenzo doesn't need this from
a subliterate with a double-digit IQ!

1152
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,460
Face it. The lights are out
and nobody's home!

1153
01:41:37,620 --> 01:41:40,130
- Just get out. Go!
- Well, merry Christmas.

1154
01:41:40,250 --> 01:41:42,460
- Get out!
- Happy holidays!

1155
01:41:43,340 --> 01:41:45,380
And a joyous yuletide!

1156
01:41:53,310 --> 01:41:55,770
"Near a great forest
lived a poor woodcutter...

1157
01:41:55,890 --> 01:41:59,100
...with his two children,
Hansel and Gretel."

1158
01:41:59,230 --> 01:42:02,690
"Times were very hard and
a day came when there was no food...

1159
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:04,940
...except a little stale bread."

1160
01:42:05,030 --> 01:42:08,570
"But Hansel..." was like you, my darling.

1161
01:42:09,870 --> 01:42:15,660
"He was a clever lad who knew
how to solve difficult problems."

1162
01:42:17,410 --> 01:42:20,080
"The woodcutter was very sad..."

1163
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,670
(Augusto) Are you going to
keep doing this?

1164
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:28,010
She brought it on herself. She
consigned herself to the outer darkness.

1165
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:32,720
Michaela, Nancy Jo, she was
a good nurse. You train her well.

1166
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:35,850
Yes, but I want someone
to give him more than medication.

1167
01:42:35,970 --> 01:42:39,560
Someone who will minister
to his mind and his soul.

1168
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,770
- I think I've found him.
- What?

1169
01:42:44,070 --> 01:42:47,280
I wrote to Omouri.
I asked him to come and stay with us.

1170
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,400
- Omouri?
- Yes.

1171
01:42:48,530 --> 01:42:52,660
Lorenzo is surrounded by women all day.
I don't want him to grow up hag-ridden.

1172
01:42:52,780 --> 01:42:55,870
But you cannot take a boy
out of his fishing village...

1173
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:58,120
...and bring him here to nurse Lorenzo.

1174
01:42:58,250 --> 01:43:01,920
Not to nurse him, to be his friend.
To bring the Comoros into this room.

1175
01:43:02,130 --> 01:43:08,340
We cannot uproot this young man
from his family, his way of life.

1176
01:43:09,420 --> 01:43:12,470
- Where will he live?
- Here, in Lorenzo's room.

1177
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:15,680
But... he has no English.

1178
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:19,600
He's a Muslim. An African.

1179
01:43:19,730 --> 01:43:25,190
We cannot bring an African to this racist
country to be a second-class citizen.

1180
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:28,280
- This is Washington, DC.
- He'll be part of this family.

1181
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:31,240
I'll teach him English.
There's a lot we can do for him.

1182
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:33,410
Oh, Michaela...

1183
01:43:33,990 --> 01:43:36,030
Here. Sit down, sit down.

1184
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:42,370
Now, the last time
Omouri saw Lorenzo...

1185
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,540
...he was climbing trees.

1186
01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:48,260
He was a wild and vibrant boy,
full of life.

1187
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:54,720
In the letter that you wrote to Omouri...

1188
01:43:55,890 --> 01:44:00,850
...did you tell him what he will see
when he walks into this room?

1189
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:07,360
I told him he'd see a young man who
was very ill and had need of a friend.

1190
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:09,780
That is all?

1191
01:44:09,900 --> 01:44:13,570
How would you have me describe him?
As a biochemical conundrum?

1192
01:44:13,700 --> 01:44:15,740
Non Ã¨ vero.

1193
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:19,700
You know he is not that for me.

1194
01:44:21,330 --> 01:44:25,040
Augusto, when you look at him,
what do you see?

1195
01:44:27,670 --> 01:44:30,130
Tell me the truth.

1196
01:46:04,100 --> 01:46:07,350
- How do I tell the man to give up?
- Say his health won't take it.

1197
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:11,360
The hours he's working are daft.
Our expectations were unrealistic.

1198
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:16,030
Look, Don's a man who's been working all
of his life in face creams and cosmetics.

1199
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:19,700
With this oil, he's having the time
of his life. You tell him. I won't.

1200
01:46:19,820 --> 01:46:22,200
All right. For his own sake, I'll have to.

1201
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:26,960
Then you can call Mrs Odone and
tell her that you've pulled the plug.

1202
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:32,960
- I'd best leave him be.
- I think you're right.

1203
01:46:44,890 --> 01:46:46,930
Omouri!

1204
01:47:03,700 --> 01:47:05,740
(Lorenzo gasping)

1205
01:47:33,440 --> 01:47:36,730
Lorenzo... Omouri is here.

1206
01:47:55,460 --> 01:47:57,500
(sings in Swahili)

1207
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:46,760
- Morning.
- Good morning, Mr Suddaby.

1208
01:48:46,890 --> 01:48:51,020
There's a bottle of pure erucic acid
triglyceride on my bench.

1209
01:48:51,140 --> 01:48:55,190
Will you see that it gets to young
Mr Odone as soon as possible, please?

1210
01:48:55,850 --> 01:48:57,900
I'm off home now. Bye-bye.

1211
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:00,570
(woman) Goodbye, Mr Suddaby.

1212
01:49:04,450 --> 01:49:07,160
(man) Well, we'd better get on with it.

1213
01:49:15,830 --> 01:49:19,340
Four parts our old friend, the oleic.

1214
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:22,800
And...

1215
01:49:23,420 --> 01:49:26,590
...one part erucic.

1216
01:49:28,350 --> 01:49:32,020
And the journey begins,
and like all good journeys...

1217
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:34,850
...with food.

1218
01:49:37,400 --> 01:49:39,650
Where's the wretched nurse?

1219
01:49:39,770 --> 01:49:43,650
I'm gonna take my baseline myself
if she doesn't get here soon.

1220
01:49:43,780 --> 01:49:47,570
A month is much too long.
If we check my blood every week...

1221
01:49:47,700 --> 01:49:53,160
...and I have a cardiogram, we should
know enough to start Lorenzo sooner.

1222
01:49:53,290 --> 01:49:55,540
- (knock on door)
- Oh, at last!

1223
01:50:03,960 --> 01:50:05,760
Hi.

1224
01:50:05,880 --> 01:50:07,680
How's the mother tiger?

1225
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:13,220
Augusto didn't tell you?
I'm here to be Lorenzo's rat.

1226
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:18,150
That's a very kind offer,
but I can't let you.

1227
01:50:18,270 --> 01:50:22,230
I'm a carrier, just like you. My blood
levels are just as high as yours.

1228
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:26,280
I've had my baseline taken...
and I'm starving.

1229
01:50:27,910 --> 01:50:31,660
Oh, I have been wanting
to meet Lorenzo's main man.

1230
01:50:32,910 --> 01:50:35,290
(Omouri) I am content
to greet Aunt Deirdre.

1231
01:50:35,410 --> 01:50:38,040
Well, it's good to meet you too.

1232
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:42,840
Now, now, Michaela. I want no argument.
Michaela, you cannot test it.

1233
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,130
- Lorenzo needs you fit and well.
- So you would put Deirdre at risk...

1234
01:50:47,260 --> 01:50:51,720
- ...without even discussing...
- Hey! I backpacked all through India.

1235
01:50:51,850 --> 01:50:54,890
I must have eaten
rapeseed oil up the wazoo.

1236
01:50:55,020 --> 01:50:58,520
- Ah, I've been fasting all day.
- All right, go ahead. Try it.

1237
01:50:58,600 --> 01:51:00,690
OK, here goes.

1238
01:51:04,530 --> 01:51:06,900
So... does it taste awful?

1239
01:51:07,780 --> 01:51:09,950
- No? Good.
- It's good.

1240
01:51:10,070 --> 01:51:12,490
Good. Eat, eat.

1241
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:19,540
(Suddaby) Your sister
had no side effects?

1242
01:51:19,670 --> 01:51:24,130
None at all. If we can normalise the
levels of a carrier so quickly, who knows?

1243
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:27,300
- We'll start Lorenzo immediately.
- Marvellous.

1244
01:51:27,420 --> 01:51:29,420
- We're all terribly grateful.
- No, no.

1245
01:51:29,550 --> 01:51:34,300
- Not to mention Deedee, the family rat.
- (Suddaby laughs)

1246
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:38,230
- What dosage will you give the lad?
- We don't have time to be conservative.

1247
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:40,810
We've decided on eight grams.

1248
01:52:34,570 --> 01:52:37,330
(Deirdre) Â¶ I ride an old paint.

1249
01:52:37,490 --> 01:52:39,950
Â¶ And lead on an old Dan.

1250
01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:42,710
Â¶ I'm goin' to Montana.

1251
01:52:42,830 --> 01:52:45,630
- Â¶ To throw the Hoolihan.
- (phone rings)

1252
01:52:51,010 --> 01:52:52,720
- Hello.
- (man) Mr Odone?

1253
01:52:52,840 --> 01:52:54,260
Odo-ne, yes.

1254
01:52:54,380 --> 01:52:57,930
Look, we have a problem
with this blood sample.

1255
01:52:58,060 --> 01:53:01,020
You have a problem?
What is the problem?

1256
01:53:01,140 --> 01:53:04,650
Could there have been
a mistake in the labelling?

1257
01:53:04,770 --> 01:53:07,520
No. No mistake. Why?

1258
01:53:07,650 --> 01:53:13,450
Well, we ran the assay twice and
the levels of C24 and C26 read normal.

1259
01:53:19,660 --> 01:53:21,700
They read normal?

1260
01:53:22,700 --> 01:53:25,790
Well, uh, I...

1261
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:29,210
Do you have the sample in front of you?

1262
01:53:29,380 --> 01:53:31,000
Yes.

1263
01:53:31,130 --> 01:53:35,090
- What is the name on the sample?
- Lorenzo Michael Murphy Odone.

1264
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:37,260
It's Odo-ne.

1265
01:53:38,010 --> 01:53:40,260
No, there's no mistake.

1266
01:53:41,270 --> 01:53:44,140
- But thank you very much.
- OK, bye.

1267
01:53:54,360 --> 01:53:57,110
Â¶ Whoopie-ti-yi-yo.

1268
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,990
Â¶ Get along, little dogies...

1269
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:12,130
- What's going on?
- His levels are normal.

1270
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:14,920
- Play! Play!
- Oh, that's wonderful!

1271
01:54:18,390 --> 01:54:21,010
(Wendy) Now, drink it up, son.

1272
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:23,430
Every last drop. Good.

1273
01:54:25,060 --> 01:54:29,350
Mom says this is
the only bottle in the world.

1274
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:34,030
Now that we have destroyed
Lorenzo's blood fats...

1275
01:54:34,150 --> 01:54:38,280
...I'm sure that Mr Suddaby
will make us plenty more, huh?

1276
01:54:39,160 --> 01:54:42,870
Mom says this is bootleg.

1277
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:47,000
I know this is only
a fraction of what it cost...

1278
01:54:47,120 --> 01:54:49,750
- No, no, no, Wendy.
- You gotta take it.

1279
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:53,210
No, we work on the barter system.

1280
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,920
Our oil, your produce, huh?

1281
01:54:56,050 --> 01:54:59,430
There aren't that many
potatoes in the world.

1282
01:54:59,550 --> 01:55:01,600
OK. Here you go.

1283
01:55:03,260 --> 01:55:05,020
So, when will you tell Nikolais?

1284
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:08,980
Well, we told him and the other doctors
and we sent all the figures.

1285
01:55:09,100 --> 01:55:13,400
- What did they have to say?
- They deliberate. They want more study.

1286
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:16,860
- Wendy, that's enough.
- So the other kids have to wait?

1287
01:55:16,990 --> 01:55:19,200
We know what to do
about that, don't we?

1288
01:55:19,280 --> 01:55:22,530
The doctors had a very hard time
swallowing the first oil.

1289
01:55:22,660 --> 01:55:26,120
They want to see how it goes
with Lorenzo on the second.

1290
01:55:26,250 --> 01:55:28,620
- But we don't have time, do we?
- No.

1291
01:55:28,750 --> 01:55:32,040
So we leave science
to its own concerns, huh?

1292
01:55:33,750 --> 01:55:36,210
- Merry Christmas.
- Goodbye, Jake.

1293
01:55:48,020 --> 01:55:50,060
(silence)

1294
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:13,880
What happened to the suction machine?

1295
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:17,960
There's no need, Michaela.
Not for four hours.

1296
01:56:18,090 --> 01:56:20,010
I turned the machine off.

1297
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:25,600
All last night he made
to swallow for himself.

1298
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:29,430
Augusto! Augusto!

1299
01:56:39,780 --> 01:56:42,530
We hope to make
an announcement quite soon...

1300
01:56:42,650 --> 01:56:46,490
...about a new development
in our diet therapy.

1301
01:56:46,620 --> 01:56:49,750
It's expensive but,
with the help of the government...

1302
01:56:49,870 --> 01:56:52,540
...and of this wonderful foundation...

1303
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:57,210
...we are going to start a trial
before the end of the year.

1304
01:57:06,300 --> 01:57:09,810
I can hear from that
that you wish us Godspeed.

1305
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:22,900
Excuse me, Doctor!

1306
01:57:23,030 --> 01:57:26,370
Are you referring to the oil
the Odones have invented for Lorenzo?

1307
01:57:26,530 --> 01:57:29,540
- We'll take questions later.
- No, it's a good question.

1308
01:57:29,700 --> 01:57:34,120
I should have mentioned it perhaps but...
The Odones have been extremely active...

1309
01:57:34,250 --> 01:57:36,250
...and we are in their debt.

1310
01:57:36,380 --> 01:57:39,040
Thanks to them,
we are preparing a protocol...

1311
01:57:39,170 --> 01:57:42,380
...for review by
the human-studies committee.

1312
01:57:42,510 --> 01:57:45,760
If then we can persuade
the government to fund us...

1313
01:57:45,880 --> 01:57:51,600
...then we shall know if this oil is of
more than temporary therapeutic value.

1314
01:57:51,720 --> 01:57:54,980
But it works! Lorenzo's
blood levels are down to normal.

1315
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:59,520
It's precisely for that reason
that we are conducting this trial.

1316
01:57:59,650 --> 01:58:01,980
You don't expect me
to endorse a therapy...

1317
01:58:02,110 --> 01:58:05,280
...just on the basis
of one hopeful observation?

1318
01:58:05,450 --> 01:58:08,700
There's two! My boy's been
takin' the oil for six months.

1319
01:58:08,820 --> 01:58:12,080
Yes, Ellard, and his blood levels
are down to normal. He's fine.

1320
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,120
You are playing with people's hopes.

1321
01:58:14,250 --> 01:58:19,420
Where do these Odones get off, thinking
they know more than the doctors?

1322
01:58:19,590 --> 01:58:23,010
- Where did you get this oil?
- The Odones. They get it from England.

1323
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:27,380
They don't have approval from the FDA.
It's bootleg. Give the doctors a chance...

1324
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:30,300
Come on, Ellard!
It's a mixture of two cooking oils.

1325
01:58:30,430 --> 01:58:34,730
Two cooking oils? What's the dosage,
please? What are the side effects of this?

1326
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:37,900
- How would we pay for it?
- There must be a formal protocol...

1327
01:58:38,020 --> 01:58:42,690
...before we can raise funds. I understand
it will cost over $1,000 a litre.

1328
01:58:42,820 --> 01:58:48,780
And no insurance company or government
will support you without the approval.

1329
01:58:48,910 --> 01:58:51,990
And the only way to get it
is through thorough testing.

1330
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:55,750
That's what they told AIDS people
about AZT, but they fought and got it.

1331
01:58:55,870 --> 01:58:59,540
Because they were dying.
They didn't have time to wait...

1332
01:58:59,670 --> 01:59:02,960
We padded our walls yesterday!
I want that oil!

1333
01:59:13,390 --> 01:59:17,100
There, my darling. That's a sweet boy.

1334
01:59:19,020 --> 01:59:21,060
What a big, strong boy.

1335
01:59:21,940 --> 01:59:24,400
Yes, my darling. Yes.

1336
01:59:57,220 --> 01:59:58,850
You see, Michaela...

1337
01:59:58,980 --> 02:00:03,360
...it's as though he is trapped
down in some dark cave.

1338
02:00:04,860 --> 02:00:10,150
Because he's lost so much myelin,
he can't find his way out.

1339
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:14,070
Now, we know
his simple functions are intact.

1340
02:00:14,200 --> 02:00:17,950
He breathes, he swallows,
his heart beats.

1341
02:00:18,660 --> 02:00:23,630
And from the outside world,
he receives sensation.

1342
02:00:23,750 --> 02:00:25,840
A touch...

1343
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:29,510
...pain, cold.

1344
02:00:30,170 --> 02:00:33,510
And here are the primal feelings.

1345
02:00:33,640 --> 02:00:36,810
Fear, hunger, desire.

1346
02:00:38,390 --> 02:00:44,060
While up here in the neocortex,
the higher brain, locked here...

1347
02:00:44,190 --> 02:00:48,480
...are his reasoning,
imagination, memory.

1348
02:00:49,650 --> 02:00:52,530
The things that make us each ourselves.

1349
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:59,750
So how does he reach us?

1350
02:01:02,790 --> 02:01:06,080
When a simple swallow
is such a huge task?

1351
02:01:09,670 --> 02:01:11,720
To find...

1352
02:01:12,340 --> 02:01:16,350
To find the way,
the path from his mind...

1353
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:20,220
...to the outside world...

1354
02:01:22,310 --> 02:01:25,770
...is like willing himself
through a brick wall.

1355
02:01:28,110 --> 02:01:30,150
So he waits, huh?

1356
02:01:35,320 --> 02:01:37,370
He waits.

1357
02:01:39,660 --> 02:01:41,700
Michaela...

1358
02:01:47,080 --> 02:01:49,130
Do you ever think...

1359
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:53,970
...that...

1360
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:58,600
...maybe all this struggle...

1361
02:02:00,760 --> 02:02:04,430
...it may have been for
somebody else's kid?

1362
02:02:23,370 --> 02:02:25,410
Yes.

1363
02:02:55,940 --> 02:02:58,820
But I promised... I promised him...

1364
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:02,030
...his world would never be silent.

1365
02:03:03,990 --> 02:03:06,040
He would never be alone.

1366
02:03:07,580 --> 02:03:09,420
Yes.

1367
02:03:12,250 --> 02:03:15,090
(Michaela) "One morning,
a little rabbit sat on a bank."

1368
02:03:15,210 --> 02:03:19,550
"He pricked his ears and listened
to the trit-trot, trit-trot of a pony."

1369
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:23,310
"A gig was coming along the road.
It was driven by Mr McGregor."

1370
02:03:23,430 --> 02:03:26,930
"And beside him sat Mrs McGregor
in her best bonnet."

1371
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:30,810
"As soon as they had passed, little
Benjamin Bunny slid down into the road...

1372
02:03:30,940 --> 02:03:35,030
...and set off with a hop, skip and a jump
to call upon his relations...

1373
02:03:35,150 --> 02:03:38,860
...who lived in the woods
at the back of Mr McGregor's garden."

1374
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:43,620
"That wood was full of rabbit holes,
and in the neatest, sandiest hole of all...

1375
02:03:43,740 --> 02:03:48,870
...lived Benjamin's aunt and his cousins,
Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter."

1376
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,330
- "Old Mrs Rabbit was a widow. She..."
- (grunts)

1377
02:03:52,460 --> 02:03:56,050
"..earned her living by knitting
rabbit-wool mittens and muffeties."

1378
02:03:56,170 --> 02:03:58,220
"I once bought a pair..."

1379
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,800
What's the matter, darling?
You don't like the story?

1380
02:04:10,440 --> 02:04:12,270
Lorenzo...

1381
02:04:14,270 --> 02:04:15,980
You don't like the story?

1382
02:04:18,820 --> 02:04:20,780
He does that a lot lately.

1383
02:04:20,900 --> 02:04:23,160
- When?
- Mainly at story time.

1384
02:04:24,370 --> 02:04:26,410
Sweetheart...

1385
02:04:26,910 --> 02:04:28,950
Listen carefully to Mama.

1386
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,750
Is your middle name Patrick?

1387
02:04:37,710 --> 02:04:40,920
No... Is it Peter?

1388
02:04:44,140 --> 02:04:46,260
No, Mommy.

1389
02:04:46,390 --> 02:04:49,220
Is it Michael? Michael Murphy?

1390
02:04:52,350 --> 02:04:54,020
Yes! Yes!

1391
02:04:54,150 --> 02:04:56,190
Only you don't know how to say that.

1392
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:58,780
Will you teach Mommy how to say no?

1393
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:02,200
When you close your eyes,
does that mean no?

1394
02:05:02,320 --> 02:05:05,530
Oh, what an idiot!
That was a yes question.

1395
02:05:05,660 --> 02:05:10,700
All right. You don't want to hear
any more Benjamin Bunny, do you?

1396
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:16,920
That's an emphatic reply!
Very well, young man.

1397
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:23,260
No more Benjamin Bunny. How could
Mommy have been so thoughtless?

1398
02:05:23,380 --> 02:05:28,010
We're going to take all of these
baby books to the children's hospital.

1399
02:05:28,180 --> 02:05:31,730
It's time for the big stuff.
Something heroic.

1400
02:05:31,850 --> 02:05:34,850
There you go.
You gotta tell us what you want.

1401
02:05:34,980 --> 02:05:38,150
The Once and Future King by TH White.

1402
02:05:40,900 --> 02:05:45,450
"The boy slept well in the woodland nest,
where he had laid himself down."

1403
02:05:45,610 --> 02:05:48,700
"At first, he only dipped
below the surface of sleep...

1404
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:52,000
...and skimmed along
like a salmon in shallow water...

1405
02:05:52,120 --> 02:05:56,670
...so close to the surface
that he fancied himself in air."

1406
02:05:57,580 --> 02:06:01,000
"He thought himself awake,
when he was already asleep."

1407
02:06:01,130 --> 02:06:02,840
"He saw the stars above his face...

1408
02:06:03,010 --> 02:06:06,050
...whirling on their silent
and sleepless axis...

1409
02:06:06,180 --> 02:06:09,720
...and the leaves of the trees
rustling against them."

1410
02:06:09,850 --> 02:06:13,020
"And he heard small changes
in the grass."

1411
02:06:13,180 --> 02:06:17,690
"These little noises of footsteps
and soft-fringed wing beats...

1412
02:06:17,810 --> 02:06:20,570
...and stealthy bellies
drawn over the grass blades."

1413
02:06:20,690 --> 02:06:26,240
"A rattling against the bracken at first
frightened him, but interested him."

1414
02:06:31,830 --> 02:06:33,540
OK. Is it your thumb?

1415
02:06:36,330 --> 02:06:38,380
Is it your index finger?

1416
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:43,050
Your middle finger?

1417
02:06:44,760 --> 02:06:47,090
Your little finger?

1418
02:06:47,220 --> 02:06:51,680
It's your little finger. You think
you can move your little finger.

1419
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:55,560
OK. Tell your brain to tell your arm...

1420
02:06:55,730 --> 02:06:59,230
...to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1421
02:07:02,230 --> 02:07:05,320
Come on, sweetheart.
Tell your brain to tell your arm...

1422
02:07:05,440 --> 02:07:08,860
...to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1423
02:07:09,870 --> 02:07:12,530
Come on, my friend.
What a wonderful thing. A "yes".

1424
02:07:12,660 --> 02:07:15,500
And then there'll be
a "could be" and a "perhaps"...

1425
02:07:15,620 --> 02:07:19,120
...and maybe even a "shut up, Mommy",
but now we just have to get to "yes".

1426
02:07:19,290 --> 02:07:22,380
So tell your brain to tell your arm...

1427
02:07:22,500 --> 02:07:25,800
...to tell your hand
to move your little finger.

1428
02:07:29,050 --> 02:07:32,720
Come on, my love.
Tell your brain to tell your hand...

1429
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:35,180
...to move your little finger.

1430
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:41,360
- (Deirdre) Come on, Lorenzo.
- (Omouri) You can do it, my friend.

1431
02:07:41,480 --> 02:07:43,520
You can do it.

1432
02:07:44,900 --> 02:07:46,940
(Augusto) Come on, Lorenzo.

1433
02:07:51,160 --> 02:07:53,200
(all gasp with pleasure)

1434
02:08:07,340 --> 02:08:10,760
(Augusto) And they are born
without myelin, correct?

1435
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:15,010
(man) The only naturally dismyelinated
higher mammals in existence.

1436
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:17,520
(Augusto) And this is passed
from mother to son?

1437
02:08:17,640 --> 02:08:19,640
Yes.

1438
02:08:19,770 --> 02:08:23,060
Their mother is from Edinburgh.
That's Jasmine.

1439
02:08:23,190 --> 02:08:25,650
She doesn't shake, but her male pups do.

1440
02:08:26,190 --> 02:08:30,700
- You think you can stop them shaking?
- Well, we hope so.

1441
02:08:30,820 --> 02:08:35,280
By implanting nerve cells, we expect
to see the growth of new myelin.

1442
02:08:35,410 --> 02:08:38,830
We've been partially remyelinating
rats and mice for ten years...

1443
02:08:38,950 --> 02:08:41,210
...and it's repeatable.

1444
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:47,630
But if we could fund this work,
it could be the first in higher animals.

1445
02:08:47,750 --> 02:08:50,670
And then in human beings, huh?

1446
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:52,800
Well, in time, yes.

1447
02:08:53,510 --> 02:08:57,140
Dr Duncan,
if I help you raise these funds...

1448
02:08:57,260 --> 02:09:00,600
...and if we can get the researchers
together to collaborate...

1449
02:09:00,730 --> 02:09:05,060
...I think we can achieve
very much in a very short time.

1450
02:09:05,230 --> 02:09:09,070
Augusto, we scientists
are a very competitive lot.

1451
02:09:09,190 --> 02:09:14,700
Such a collaboration is a lovely idea,
but sadly that is not how science works.

1452
02:09:14,820 --> 02:09:19,750
That's not necessarily so, because
remember the Manhattan Project?

1453
02:09:19,870 --> 02:09:23,830
28 months. It took them 28 months.

1454
02:09:23,960 --> 02:09:28,300
Now, if scientists can come together
to build the atomic bomb...

1455
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:33,340
...surely they come together
to remyelinate some puppy dogs?

1456
02:09:44,940 --> 02:09:47,520
(Michaela) Papa called from Italy, darling.

1457
02:09:47,650 --> 02:09:51,490
He's missing his Lorenzacchio
very, very much.

1458
02:09:51,610 --> 02:09:55,700
But he wants me to tell you
he's making a big dinner tonight...

1459
02:09:55,820 --> 02:09:59,950
...a banquet of brain food for
the cleverest doctors in the world...

1460
02:10:00,080 --> 02:10:04,250
...who've gathered together to put the
myelin back in the shaking puppy dogs.

1461
02:10:04,370 --> 02:10:06,920
And if they can achieve that...

1462
02:10:07,080 --> 02:10:11,920
...someday there might be a way to help
all the people who've lost their myelin.

1463
02:10:12,050 --> 02:10:16,130
Not only the boys with ALD,
but the people with multiple sclerosis...

1464
02:10:16,260 --> 02:10:18,930
...and many other diseases, Lorenzo.

1465
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:24,690
And then think, my brave boy, if they
can ever give you back your myelin...

1466
02:10:24,810 --> 02:10:31,020
...you'll be able to tell your brain to tell
your toes, your fingers, your anything...

1467
02:10:31,150 --> 02:10:34,070
- ...to do what you want them to do.
- (Lorenzo) ..what I want them to do.

1468
02:10:34,190 --> 02:10:36,530
(both) And then, one day...

1469
02:10:37,320 --> 02:10:39,490
(Lorenzo) ..I'll hear my voice...

1470
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:44,370
...and all these words I'm thinking
will get outside my head.

1471
02:11:58,070 --> 02:12:00,320
Oh! Now it broke!

1472
02:12:04,580 --> 02:12:07,250
This is Charles and this is Harry...

1473
02:12:07,370 --> 02:12:10,370
...and they've both been on
Lorenzo's Oil for two years.

1474
02:12:10,500 --> 02:12:13,920
My name is Michael Benton
and I'm twelve and a half years old.

1475
02:12:14,040 --> 02:12:17,460
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for four and a half years.

1476
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:23,470
I was diagnosed with ALD when I was
13 years old. I'm taking Lorenzo's Oil...

1477
02:12:23,640 --> 02:12:26,560
I've been taking Lorenzo's Oil
for three years.

1478
02:12:26,680 --> 02:12:31,520
Some of the activities I'm involved in
are baseball, basketball...

1479
02:12:31,650 --> 02:12:33,900
(medley of voices continues)
