Miss Williams?
- Yep.

Say.

4
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,014
It's a hat alright.

5
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,189
Sure it is. What you think it was?
- Take it easy.

6
00:01:52,484 --> 00:01:54,919
He's a secret service man.
- Secret service?

7
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:56,360
Oh.

8
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,266
I'd swear I heard something ticking.

9
00:02:00,732 --> 00:02:02,434
Are you wearing a wristwatch?
- Yes, sir.

10

Start the car.

A hat for Miss Williams.

Thank you.

Would you care to join
me in a cup of tea?

14
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:35,595
No thanks.
Anything doing this afternoon?

15

I really couldn't say.

16

Come in.

17
00:02:51,987 --> 00:02:52,917
It has arrived.

00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,083
Thank you, Grace.

19

00:03:05,367 --> 00:03:06,304
It's here.

21
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:14,985
Do you think she will like it?
- We'll soon see.

22
00:03:19,096 --> 00:03:20,188
Come in.

23
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:25,759
Your Highness. The hat.

24
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:31,379
This is the hat I told you about
that I saw in the window.

25
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,004
I thought you may like it.

26
00:03:33,322 --> 00:03:33,937
Yes.

27
00:03:34,357 --> 00:03:35,994
I don't know when you bought one last.

28
00:03:36,414 --> 00:03:37,629
I think it's very pretty.

29
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:41,441
If you don't like it I can return it.
- I do though.

30
00:03:41,787 --> 00:03:43,433
It's perfectly alright to return it.

31
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,258
I couldn't be more pleased with it.

32
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,260
If I may be excused.

33
00:03:50,043 --> 00:03:52,024
Are you feeling alright, dear?
- Yes, Uncle.

34
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,588
Do you wish to go to a motion picture?
- I don't think so.

35
00:03:55,516 --> 00:03:57,486
Horseback riding in Central Park?
- No thanks.

36
00:03:58,094 --> 00:03:59,148
A drive in the car?

37
00:03:59,947 --> 00:04:01,484
I'd rather stay here and read.

38
00:04:03,205 --> 00:04:04,392
I will keep you company.

Count de Candome.

42
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,060
Have him come in.

43
00:04:28,757 --> 00:04:30,365
Two is company.
- Stay.

44
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,199
Maria. He has come to see you, not me.

45
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:34,713
Please stay.

46
00:04:35,647 --> 00:04:36,548
If you insist.

47
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:40,509
Your Highness.

48
00:04:41,552 --> 00:04:43,311
Your Highness is looking well.
- Thank you.

49
00:04:43,811 --> 00:04:45,323
I hope you're in good health, sir.

50
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:46,839
Couldn't be better. And you?

51
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:48,254
I am fine. Thank you.

52
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,996
I'm in the neighborhood and thought you
might care to take in a motion picture.

53
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:53,696
No. I don't think so.

54
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,749
Or a horseback ride in the park?

55
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:57,118
I'm afraid not.

56
00:04:57,516 --> 00:04:59,411
A drive in the car? A lovely day for it.

57
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:00,475
Lovely.

58
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:05,850
It's very kind of you but the truth
is I have a slight headache.

59
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,297
I am very sorry.

60
00:05:07,555 --> 00:05:09,695
A drive in the open air may
be just the thing for it.

61
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,702
It's worse. I think I should lie down.
- I lie down when I have a headache.

62
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:16,614
Will you forgive me?
- Of course.

63
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:17,959
Good day.

00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:20,606
Good day, sir.
- Good day.

Thank you.

How do you feel now?
- A little better.

68

Don't you like him?

69
00:05:37,392 --> 00:05:38,837
He comes from a very good family.

70
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,344
The Candomes are one of the
oldest bloodlines in Europe.

71
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:45,776
One of his ancestors was at the Battle
of Watling with your great grandfather.

72
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:47,555
On the other side.

73
00:05:47,852 --> 00:05:50,407
If I remember rightly his ancestor
was killed in that battle.

74
00:05:50,848 --> 00:05:51,921
Drowned.
- Drowned?

75
00:05:52,422 --> 00:05:54,512
I thought the battle of
Watling was fought on land.

76
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:58,623
He was getting a drink from a brook.
He leaned in too far wearing his armor.

77
00:05:59,081 --> 00:06:01,449
Only two feet of water but he drowned.
Went right to the bottom.

78
00:06:02,956 --> 00:06:05,915
To tell you the truth, Maria.
The Count's mother has been hinting.

79
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:09,078
In normal times I would not
give him a second thought.

80
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:11,726
I must admit the match isn't
out of the question today.

81
00:06:12,209 --> 00:06:13,869
After all, let's face it. Who's left?

82
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,886
Peter of Yugoslavia is 18 years old.

83
00:06:16,397 --> 00:06:17,928
Leopold of Belgium just got married.

84
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:19,491
The Duke of Hempel is 66.

85
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:21,474
There aren't any suitable alliances.

86
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:23,566
Then I'll be an old maid.

87
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,655
If you are you, you should be ashamed.

88
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:29,406
It's not the first time our country has
been overrun and our family in exile.

89
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:30,726
We'll be back.

90
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:32,404
And in the meanwhile, Maria.

91
00:06:32,888 --> 00:06:35,010
Frankly, you should be busy
having children. Boys.

92
00:06:36,239 --> 00:06:37,827
I'll do what I can at the proper time.

93
00:06:38,276 --> 00:06:40,724
The Count's family produces
a very high rate of boys.

94
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:41,973
For nobility.

95
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,663
I want to ask you something.

96
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,122
When he goes.

97
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,221
Is that hereditary?

98
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:51,096
Your children won't have it, but your
grandchildren. It skips a generation.

99
00:06:51,435 --> 00:06:52,851
He has Bellini blood, hasn't he?

100
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:54,588
And if they go.

101
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:57,342
That means a great grandchild would go.

102
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:00,550
The baby could break its neck.

103
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:04,467
We'd investigate every possibility
before we came to any decision.

104
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,831
It's unfair to the count
to wait any longer.

105
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,972
You must tell his mother
to look elsewhere.

106
00:07:09,187 --> 00:07:10,375
Let's not be too hasty.

107
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,715
I'm positive I am not attracted to him.

108
00:07:13,162 --> 00:07:15,068
That's not the important
quality in a husband.

109
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:17,706
I understand the relationship
is quite intimate.

110
00:07:18,114 --> 00:07:19,559
You're speaking like a shop-girl.

111
00:07:20,136 --> 00:07:22,690
I don't ask for any wild,
impassioned mating.

112
00:07:23,113 --> 00:07:25,603
Only for a man with whom I
can have something in common.

113
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,590
I have to spend a lifetime with him.

114
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:29,480
Is that too much to ask?

115
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:30,962
It might be.

116
00:07:31,446 --> 00:07:32,862
You are a royal princess, Maria.

117
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,990
Are you proposing I marry him?
- I want you to think about it.

118
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:38,878
I will think about it.

119
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,986
I want you to get into a
happier frame of mind.

120
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:42,697
I will try, Uncle.

121
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,962
How would you like to visit a place?
- As you say.

122
00:07:46,286 --> 00:07:48,160
We can go to the White House.
You'd like that?

123
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,129
We visited two weeks ago.
- What of it?

124
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,754
The president likes you.
You enjoyed it and the food is good.

125
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,435
Two weeks is too soon. We'd be imposing.
- Nonsense.

126
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,190
That is my opinion, Uncle.

127
00:07:57,932 --> 00:08:00,437
You know what I think?
You need a change from me.

128
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:01,597
Untrue.

secretary and a secret service man.

face in the group.

Why not go to Ambassador
Harrison's ranch?

132
00:08:11,176 --> 00:08:12,506
At least you will see horses.

133
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:14,472
That is a good idea, Maria.

134
00:08:15,323 --> 00:08:17,540
You'd do a lot of riding.
And you have a change of climate.

135
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:19,550
I'd as soon stay here in New York.

136
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:22,257
When you return you may feel
differently toward the count.

It's possible.

Book a plane ticket to San Francisco
in the name of Mary Williams.

No address. I'll pay for the ticket
by check at the ticket office.

Yes, sir.

I am frightened in an aeroplane.

What's that, dear?

146
00:08:51,992 --> 00:08:52,922
Nothing, Uncle.

147
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,262
There will be a secret-service man
to meet her in San Francisco.

148
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:07,577
He'll go with the Harrisons
and her to the ranch.

149

I mean Her Highness and
the Harrisons. Excuse me.

150
00:09:10,573 --> 00:09:13,039
I wonder if a secret-service
man is necessary at the ranch.

I'm trying to give her some privacy.

152

That decision is not
in my province but ..

153
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:21,070
With a guest of the country like the
princess, that would not be allowed.

154

There's nothing to fear, Your Highness.
- I am not frightened.

155
00:09:26,223 --> 00:09:27,582
It's all in your mind, anyway.

156
00:09:28,074 --> 00:09:30,923
The berth is made up. When you
get into it take this sleeping pill.

And you'll wake up in San Francisco

I think one will be enough.
Have you ever taken any before?

People react differently to them.

161

If you wake up in the middle of the
night ask the stewardess for another.

00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,584
How you doing with that band leader?

177
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:57,749
A stewardess is not permitted social
engagements with passengers.

178
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:04,416
Miss.

179
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:13,753
Thank you.

180
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,697
Sleep tight.

181
00:12:36,093 --> 00:12:36,822
Here.

182
00:12:39,571 --> 00:12:40,644
Don't hurt yourself.

183
00:12:49,587 --> 00:12:51,711
Excuse me. May I have a sleeping pill?

184
00:12:52,189 --> 00:12:53,449
A sleeping pill coming up.

185
00:13:01,162 --> 00:13:02,403
Here you are, Miss.

186
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:06,106
Just swallow it. It will never hurt you.

187
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:12,744
Take another. They are pretty mild.

188
00:13:13,533 --> 00:13:14,262
Another?

189
00:13:14,646 --> 00:13:16,033
Go on. There's nothing to them.

190
00:13:20,372 --> 00:13:21,588
Don't you want any water?

191
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,203
Don't you want ..

192
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,223
Any water?

193
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,571
Well. Happy dreams.

194
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:41,868
Right.

195
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,807
Put your hand out, son.
We're turning back to New York.

196
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:47,416
Why, master?
- The man says it's foggy down there.

197
00:13:47,904 --> 00:13:48,891
At both airports.

198
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,716
You have to get up now.
We'll not be leaving New York tonight.

199
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,427
When will we be leaving?

200
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:13,558
We'll call you, sir.
As soon as it clears.

201
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:17,332
You will have to get up.

202
00:14:17,776 --> 00:14:18,444
Miss.

203
00:14:20,148 --> 00:14:20,807
Miss.

204
00:14:22,691 --> 00:14:23,346
Miss.

205
00:14:29,186 --> 00:14:30,487
You will have to get up now.

206
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:35,197
Miss. Wake up.

207
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:36,599
Wake up.

208
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:45,859
I can't wake up Lower 6.

209
00:14:51,205 --> 00:14:52,177
Miss. Wake up.

210
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,474
Lady.

211
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,822
All out. Fire.

212
00:14:56,368 --> 00:14:57,970
That's what I call a clear conscience.

213
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,123
How she sleeps like that
on one pill beats me.

214
00:15:00,446 --> 00:15:02,455
I only gave her one.
- You gave her one?

215
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:05,337
That makes two.
- Uhuh. Four.

216
00:15:06,732 --> 00:15:07,376
Well.

217
00:15:07,591 --> 00:15:09,154
Let's get her dressed.
- We'll toss.

218
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,856
The odd man dresses her.

219
00:15:11,676 --> 00:15:14,257
You go home to your wife, married man.
- Who's in charge here?

220
00:15:16,151 --> 00:15:17,796
I see what you mean. I'll wait outside.

221
00:15:20,485 --> 00:15:21,930
You are doing fine. Keep walking.

222
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:24,346
I think she's going to say something.

223
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,660
Il fait très chaud
ce soir, n'est-ce pas?

224
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,928
Come again?
- Il fait très chaud.

225
00:15:30,591 --> 00:15:32,409
What's that?
- She's speaking French.

226
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:38,624
She must know English.
She asked for the sleeping pills.

227
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:40,070
Do you know any French?

228
00:15:40,285 --> 00:15:42,158
About four words, but she
hasn't said them yet.

229
00:15:43,023 --> 00:15:44,325
I can say, 'where are you?'.

230
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:47,429
Ou et vous?

231
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:50,360
Paris.

232
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:53,473
Paris? Fine. She is only
three thousand miles off.

233
00:15:53,943 --> 00:15:55,817
I can't understand how
you haven't her address.

234
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:57,408
Only her name is listed.

235
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:00,965
Where do you live?

236
00:16:02,522 --> 00:16:03,957
Ou do vous live?

237
00:16:05,584 --> 00:16:06,485
How do you do?

238
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,263
She sure is good natured.

239
00:16:08,648 --> 00:16:11,489
You go home. I'll walk her around until
this wears off. It can't last forever.

240
00:16:11,876 --> 00:16:13,149
Sure you don't mind?
- No.

241
00:16:13,364 --> 00:16:14,436
Go on.
- Goodnight.

242
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:18,182
Where do you live?

243
00:16:22,072 --> 00:16:23,717
Honey, are you lucky I was raised right.

244
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,720
Or was I?

245
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,139
Yes. I guess I was.

246
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:33,460
A drunk.
- Come, Matilda.

247
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:34,702
Hiya, Kids.

248
00:16:39,963 --> 00:16:40,746
Oh me.

249
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:44,213
Hello?

250
00:16:44,547 --> 00:16:45,305
Williams?

251
00:16:45,703 --> 00:16:48,107
Excuse me, sir.
Have you a daughter named Mary?

252
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:49,934
You haven't.

253
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,368
I am sorry ..

254
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,231
Goodnight.

255
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,156
Getting any clearer?

256
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:01,951
If I could only sleep.

257
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,059
Another cup of coffee.

258
00:17:16,616 --> 00:17:17,288
Hello?

259
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,358
Williams?

260
00:17:18,824 --> 00:17:21,318
Excuse me, madam.
But have you a daughter named Mary?

261
00:17:21,947 --> 00:17:23,682
You have? Where is she now?

262
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,145
Oh. You are nursing her.

263
00:17:26,706 --> 00:17:28,780
I beg your pardon, ma'am. Wrong number.

264
00:17:30,939 --> 00:17:32,069
This is not practical.

265
00:17:32,867 --> 00:17:34,369
There are five pages of Williamses.

266
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,191
I think I'll just try one at random.

267
00:17:38,484 --> 00:17:39,707
The girl can't sleep.

268
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:43,911
That I fix. Where's my sleeping pills?

269
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,434
In the little drawer.

270
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:50,145
Not sleeping is terrible.

271
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:51,554
Terrible.

272
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,300
Within half an hour. Boom. Like a rock.

273
00:17:58,476 --> 00:17:59,349
Not 'Harry'.

274
00:17:59,761 --> 00:18:00,405
Mary.

275
00:18:01,411 --> 00:18:02,541
Never mind. Thank you.

276
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:06,106
Two sugars?

277
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,439
Baby.

278
00:18:17,706 --> 00:18:18,895
Open your eyes wide.

279
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:20,596
Wider.

280
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:22,528
That's it. Now.

281
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:23,727
Now think.

282
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:25,186
Maybe you live in a hotel?

283
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,586
Some hotel?

284
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:27,856
Hotel.

285
00:18:28,592 --> 00:18:29,214
Yes.

286
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,403
Now we're getting someplace. What hotel?

287
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:34,354
The coffee is getting cold.
- What's the name of the hotel?

288
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:36,055
The Waldorf? The Plaza?

289
00:18:36,306 --> 00:18:37,142
St. Regis?

290
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:38,635
Is it one name or two?

291
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,437
The coffee gets cold.
- Quiet.

292
00:18:41,102 --> 00:18:41,803
Coffee.

293
00:18:42,696 --> 00:18:43,483
Yes. Here.

294
00:18:43,995 --> 00:18:45,424
Drink this. This will do it.

295
00:18:45,943 --> 00:18:46,798
You bet.

296
00:18:50,627 --> 00:18:51,305
Now.

297
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:53,922
Is it coming to you?

298
00:18:54,502 --> 00:18:56,270
Not so quick but in half an hour.

299
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:57,883
What hotel?

300
00:19:02,258 --> 00:19:03,438
Say, that is quick.

301
00:19:03,971 --> 00:19:04,615
Mama.

302
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,117
She's sleeping already.

303
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:07,838
I never saw anything so quick.

304
00:19:08,245 --> 00:19:10,119
Maybe one sleeping pill
would have been enough.

305
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,492
Did you give her a sleeping pill?
- Two.

306
00:19:12,963 --> 00:19:13,979
You mean to say ..

307
00:19:14,324 --> 00:19:16,276
No charge. I was paid to do it.

308
00:19:27,473 --> 00:19:28,624
[ Telephone ]

309
00:19:30,844 --> 00:19:31,516
Hello?

310
00:19:31,831 --> 00:19:33,051
We had an accident.

311
00:19:34,526 --> 00:19:35,804
She passed out altogether.

312
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:38,049
That girl in Lower 6.

313
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,168
Listen. She can sleep it off at my
place but I want Jean to undress her.

314
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,735
Hurry over.

315
00:19:49,911 --> 00:19:50,841
Jeanie. Get up.

316
00:19:53,532 --> 00:19:54,594
What's the matter?

317
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:55,880
Get dressed.

318
00:19:56,428 --> 00:19:57,202
What for?

319
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,805
Eddie wants you to
undress a girl for him.

320
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:05,318
Huh?

321
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:43,793
I thought a thousand-dollar reward
to whoever locates Her Highness ..

322
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,203
Might spur them on.

323
00:21:45,874 --> 00:21:48,480
Make that two thousand.
- She's here. Her Highness is here.

324
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,228
Her Highness is here.
Thank you, commissioner.

325
00:21:52,719 --> 00:21:54,525
Where have you been?
- I've been sleeping.

326
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:56,244
Where were you sleeping, Maria?

327
00:21:56,459 --> 00:21:58,619
I took too many pills and the
plane turned and came back.

328
00:21:58,971 --> 00:22:00,580
I found that out. Where did you sleep?

329
00:22:01,091 --> 00:22:02,626
At the airport.
- At the airport?

330
00:22:03,018 --> 00:22:05,538
That's impossible.
I went through the airport 20 times.

331
00:22:05,918 --> 00:22:07,964
Where in the airport?
- In the ladies lounge.

332
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:10,373
The ladies lounge?

333
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,859
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,060
I'm glad you are safe, Your Highness.
- Thank you.

335
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:16,312
Her Highness all night
in a ladies lounge.

336
00:22:16,701 --> 00:22:18,885
Maria, sometimes I wonder
if you know your position.

337
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,301
I would like to take a bath.
- How do you feel?

338
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:23,916
I am alright.
- Maybe you have a cold coming on.

339
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:25,253
No, Uncle.

340
00:22:29,303 --> 00:22:30,885
I remember drinking coffee.

341
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,223
But after that ..

342
00:22:37,579 --> 00:22:39,079
I got undressed by myself.

343
00:22:43,174 --> 00:22:44,993
But the birthmark.

344
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,239
I undressed myself.

345
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,436
But the birthmark.

346
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,208
What is that, dear?

347
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,508
Nothing, Uncle.

348
00:22:58,655 --> 00:22:59,985
I thought you said something.

349
00:23:00,736 --> 00:23:02,855
When I think of you all
night in that ladies lounge.

350
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:06,319
That airplane won't turn around
again without me knowing it.

351
00:23:06,766 --> 00:23:09,871
I'll get reports on its progress every
hour until it reaches San Francisco.

352
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,029
I would rather not leave tonight, Uncle.

353
00:23:12,396 --> 00:23:13,440
You might be right.

354
00:23:13,835 --> 00:23:15,680
Get over that experience
in the ladies lounge.

355
00:23:16,568 --> 00:23:17,972
I'll telephone the Harrisons.

356
00:23:20,258 --> 00:23:22,240
How did he know about the birthmark?

357
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:23,651
What's that?

358
00:23:24,251 --> 00:23:25,681
Nothing. Uncle.

359
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,610
I thought you said something.

360
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,636
I'm just going for a walk in the park.
- Yes, Your Highness.

361
00:23:38,045 --> 00:23:40,978
I'll only be a moment. No reason
to tire yourself out following me.

362
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:42,014
Is there?

363
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:44,618
No, Your Highness.
- Sit down and read your paper.

364
00:23:46,475 --> 00:23:47,147
Go on.

365
00:23:50,684 --> 00:23:51,843
Goodbye, Your Highness.

366
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:43,008
Turn this corner.
Come on, turn the corner.

367
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:45,180
A wise guy. Just watch this.

368
00:24:57,276 --> 00:24:58,279
I made a mistake.

369
00:24:58,614 --> 00:24:59,789
I'll say you did.

370
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:02,342
Somebody was following you.
He was right behind us.

371
00:25:02,865 --> 00:25:04,195
I don't know how he got away.

372
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:05,969
Don't you remember me?

373
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:07,818
Go on, peddle your papers.

374
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,555
You slept in my room last night.

375
00:25:11,895 --> 00:25:12,952
Why, you ..

376
00:25:16,334 --> 00:25:17,287
Oh no.

377
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:24,386
That is true. I did.
I didn't recognise him.

378
00:25:25,204 --> 00:25:26,442
Excuse me, buddy.

379
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:28,940
I'm out of here.
- I am terribly sorry.

380
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:30,345
Can I help you?

381
00:25:33,145 --> 00:25:35,448
Then this fellow got knocked down
again and she helped him up.

382
00:25:35,788 --> 00:25:38,251
As near as I can make out she
met him someplace before.

383
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:40,967
Right now, they're both
having cherry cokes.

384
00:25:41,308 --> 00:25:42,198
Cherry cokes?

385
00:25:42,823 --> 00:25:43,667
What's that?

386
00:25:44,869 --> 00:25:47,030
Don't let them out of your sight.
And keep calling me.

387
00:25:47,529 --> 00:25:48,287
Yes, sir.

388
00:25:51,332 --> 00:25:52,433
How does it feel now?

389
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:54,419
Fine. I don't feel anything.

390
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,736
I'm terribly sorry I
didn't recognise you.

391
00:25:57,049 --> 00:25:58,150
It wasn't your fault.

392
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:04,197
Where did you learn to speak French?

393
00:26:04,864 --> 00:26:05,994
How do you know I can?

394
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:08,594
You were speaking it last night.
- What did I say?

395
00:26:09,021 --> 00:26:10,666
I don't know. I couldn't understand you.

396
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:13,066
You thought you were in Paris.
- I did?

397
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:15,027
Have you travelled in Europe a lot?

398
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,543
I was born there.
I came to this country only recently.

399
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:19,259
How do you speak English?

400
00:26:19,742 --> 00:26:22,345
I had a very good education.
My family insisted I know languages.

401
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:24,717
I see.

402
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:28,031
Where are they now? Your family I mean.

403
00:26:28,959 --> 00:26:30,203
They are still abroad.

404
00:26:31,358 --> 00:26:32,145
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:34,940
I hope they are safe.
- They are in London now.

406
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,011
They lost everything I guess?

407
00:26:39,717 --> 00:26:41,906
They lost a great deal.

408
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:45,284
What does your father do?

409
00:26:46,986 --> 00:26:48,165
Do?
- For a living.

410
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:51,464
He had an income.

411
00:26:54,266 --> 00:26:56,909
If you want me to change the
subject don't be ashamed to say so.

412
00:26:57,427 --> 00:26:58,827
It might be better.

413
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:02,046
You poor kid.
What you must have gone through.

414
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:05,506
You are a stranger here.
I'll show you the town.

415
00:27:06,175 --> 00:27:08,421
Would you like to see Grant's tomb?
You have heard of Grant?

416
00:27:08,742 --> 00:27:10,988
He was a great civil war general
who later became president.

417
00:27:11,203 --> 00:27:12,361
I've seen Grant's tomb.

418
00:27:12,872 --> 00:27:13,630
You have?

419
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:15,229
That's funny. I haven't.

420
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,522
What's it like?

421
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,848
Very impressive. You'd like to see it?
- Okay.

422
00:27:19,386 --> 00:27:20,080
Oh no.

423
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:23,194
I'm showing you the town.
- I wouldn't mind seeing it again.

424
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:27,043
You stayed over on my account.
You'll get more than a usual date.

425
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:29,840
I would much rather you
make this a 'usual date'.

426
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:32,563
If you worry about money,
I can afford it.

427
00:27:32,961 --> 00:27:35,486
No. Do the same things you do when
you take out an ordinary girl.

428
00:27:35,874 --> 00:27:36,841
I mean any girl.

429
00:27:37,186 --> 00:27:39,514
Go to the same places
and act the same way.

430
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,082
You are sure?
- I am very sure.

431
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,207
I usually go out with two friends.
We can make it a foursome.

432
00:27:47,497 --> 00:27:48,541
That would be nice.

433
00:27:51,951 --> 00:27:52,881
Boy. Check.

434
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:00,957
Don't expect anything
out of the ordinary.

435
00:28:05,832 --> 00:28:06,504
Eddie.

436
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,308
How do you do.

437
00:28:10,699 --> 00:28:11,600
How do you do.

438
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,677
Remember me?
I gave you one sleeping pill.

439
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:15,073
Oh, yes.

440
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:16,935
That's my wife.
- How do you do.

441
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:18,482
How do you do.
- You met?

442
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,297
I guess you don't remember her.

443
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:22,419
Oh Eddie.

444
00:28:23,086 --> 00:28:23,758
Tears.

445
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,580
I didn't get any of that. I'm the
husband. I get a kiss on the cheek.

446
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:29,315
They're going away to
the army to be fliers.

447
00:28:29,863 --> 00:28:32,077
Jean, you knew it.
You went with us when we signed up.

448
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:34,777
I know. But I didn't think
they would take you.

449
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:36,964
I thought you might have some disease.

450
00:28:37,629 --> 00:28:38,473
That's fine.

451
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:40,859
Would you want us not to go?

452
00:28:44,998 --> 00:28:46,093
I got none of that.

453
00:28:46,471 --> 00:28:48,946
Would you like to hug me a little
just so we don't seem conspicuous?

454
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,305
Well.

455
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:53,481
Get away from that girl.
- There you are. Equal rights.

456
00:28:54,045 --> 00:28:54,975
Shall we go in?

457
00:28:59,849 --> 00:29:01,785
You get dressed and we go someplace.
- I can't.

458
00:29:02,033 --> 00:29:02,648
Why?

459
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:05,454
Today is for women's defense work.
- Can't you skip it for a day?

460
00:29:05,846 --> 00:29:08,857
Are you crazy? She'd be court martialed
and shot. She's a general now.

461
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,022
A Major Lieutenant.
- There's no such thing.

462
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,197
There is in her army.
Everybody's something.

463
00:29:13,412 --> 00:29:16,538
Mrs Mulvaney is a double Sergeant
General Colonel, 2nd Class.

464
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,457
Whipped cream with a cherry on it.

465
00:29:18,981 --> 00:29:21,066
If you'd like help us a
little we can use you.

466
00:29:21,513 --> 00:29:23,990
Then we spend the evening together.
- That's not right. It's no fun.

467
00:29:24,314 --> 00:29:26,672
It would be fun for me.
Really it would. I'd like to do that.

468
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:28,556
All set. Let's play some handball.

469
00:29:28,786 --> 00:29:31,089
You sure this suits you?
- I couldn't be having a better time.

470
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,533
You're easy to please.

471
00:29:32,748 --> 00:29:34,650
Leave your things here.
We work in our basement.

472
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,318
That's a cute dame.
- No kidding.

473
00:29:38,861 --> 00:29:40,798
I didn't think she would stay over.
- You didn't?

474
00:29:41,171 --> 00:29:42,587
A pity she hasn't got more time.

475
00:29:42,971 --> 00:29:44,187
Hitler will pay for that.

476
00:29:46,123 --> 00:29:47,973
Have you ever seen Grant's tomb?
- No.

477
00:29:49,406 --> 00:29:50,879
That is because we were born here.

478
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:54,092
Now I'd like to spend the next
two weeks sightseeing like a hick.

479
00:29:54,763 --> 00:29:56,351
I'd like to spend some time with Jean.

480
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:00,535
She thought we'd stay home for two
weeks before joining the air force.

481
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,839
She had all kinds of plans
for both of us to be alone.

482
00:30:05,209 --> 00:30:07,852
Then I had to break it to her that the
company wanted us to keep working.

483
00:30:10,329 --> 00:30:12,248
I never want to see that
look on her face again.

484
00:30:13,681 --> 00:30:16,190
She never cried. Nothing.
Until she got in the bathroom.

485
00:30:19,345 --> 00:30:20,732
I heard her with the shower on.

486
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:25,150
Now that you are going, don't
you wish you'd never met Jean?

487
00:30:25,923 --> 00:30:27,282
So you wouldn't feel this way?

488
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,061
Is that funny?

489
00:30:30,012 --> 00:30:31,773
You worry how I feel leaving Jean.

490
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:34,026
I worry how you can go. Leaving nobody.

491
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:38,285
I wouldn't like to go if I didn't have
Jean waiting for me to come back.

492
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:44,777
Don't move the patient.

493
00:30:45,196 --> 00:30:47,851
Don't ever, until you have
determined the nature of the injury.

494
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:50,630
If possible, the patient
should be kept warm.

495
00:30:51,127 --> 00:30:53,498
Wrapped in blankets supplemented
by hot-water bottles.

496
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,730
Do you see why it bunches? Here, let me.

497
00:31:00,126 --> 00:31:04,625
In an emergency, a telephone directory,
a magazine or even a rolled newspaper ..

498
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,510
Can be used as a splint for an arm.

499
00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:08,873
A cravat folded handkerchief will do.

500
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:10,453
Tie the splint in place.

501
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,193
The new women.

502
00:31:12,847 --> 00:31:13,916
This way please.

503
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:17,482
Mrs Mulvaney. Would it disturb
you if we play handball?

504
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,694
Of course not.

505
00:31:18,986 --> 00:31:20,173
Your name?
- Anna.

506
00:31:21,547 --> 00:31:22,943
Your second name?
- Pulaski.

507
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,663
Mrs Pulaski.

508
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,322
I am married.

509
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,292
Well?

510
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:29,052
You warm up. I'll be right up.

511
00:31:29,267 --> 00:31:30,741
What would you like to do, Anna?

512
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,202
Well, maybe ..

513
00:31:33,051 --> 00:31:34,880
I like to learn Red Cross.

514
00:31:35,666 --> 00:31:36,538
Can you read?

515
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:37,704
No, ma'am.

516
00:31:38,601 --> 00:31:40,990
It will be very hard, Anna.
There are some things you must study.

517
00:31:41,351 --> 00:31:42,888
You tell me and I will learn.

518
00:31:43,406 --> 00:31:46,261
You'd be useful doing what you know.
What do you think you can do best?

519
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,270
I can do everything.

520
00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:50,228
I raised nine children.

521
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,503
I ought to know everything.

522
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:54,842
Anna, with nine children ..

523
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:57,878
I don't know if it's right for you
to take afternoons away from home.

524
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:00,715
But I haven't got nine
children at home now.

525
00:32:01,097 --> 00:32:01,939
Only seven.

526
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:04,177
I have one boy in the army.

527
00:32:04,614 --> 00:32:05,951
One boy in the navy.

528
00:32:06,437 --> 00:32:09,625
And I have only seven at
home and I have lots of time.

529
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,893
Lots of time. The house is so empty.

530
00:32:13,851 --> 00:32:14,666
Well, Anna.

531
00:32:15,936 --> 00:32:18,410
The truth is we can use anyone
with her own sewing machine.

532
00:32:18,845 --> 00:32:19,546
Sewing?

533
00:32:22,686 --> 00:32:24,870
I am the best sewer you've ever seen.

534
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,552
You don't need anybody else.

535
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:27,979
Send them home.

536
00:32:29,905 --> 00:32:32,047
Alright, Anna.
Miss Jeffreys will tell you what to do.

537
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:33,196
This way.

538
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,242
I thank you so much.
- Thank you, Mrs Pulaski.

539
00:32:41,068 --> 00:32:41,912
Name please?

540
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:43,214
Mary Williams.

541
00:32:44,301 --> 00:32:45,657
Can you run a sewing machine?

542
00:32:45,986 --> 00:32:47,314
I am afraid I can't.

543
00:32:47,931 --> 00:32:49,127
We need sewing.

544
00:32:49,915 --> 00:32:51,181
Can you sew by hand?

545
00:32:52,107 --> 00:32:53,345
I've never tried.

546
00:32:54,003 --> 00:32:55,133
I've done petit point.

547
00:32:55,443 --> 00:32:56,317
Petit point?

548
00:32:57,985 --> 00:33:00,248
It may be a long war but ..

549
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,203
I don't think it will be that long.

550
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:06,315
Still, I'd like to see a soldier
in a petit point nightgown.

551
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:09,078
Let's see.

552
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,463
Can you cook?

553
00:33:11,358 --> 00:33:12,238
No. I can't.

554
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,446
No sewing or cooking?

555
00:33:14,788 --> 00:33:15,975
You are not a home girl.

556
00:33:16,439 --> 00:33:17,769
Can you operate a typewriter?

557
00:33:18,707 --> 00:33:19,399
No.

558
00:33:20,144 --> 00:33:21,303
Are you a filing clerk?

559
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:23,170
No.

560
00:33:24,078 --> 00:33:26,284
I can go on guessing but
there is an easier way.

561
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:27,595
What can you do?

562
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:29,494
I can ..

563
00:33:30,752 --> 00:33:31,653
Roll bandages.

564
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,521
I am sorry. We're all out of bandages.

565
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:36,145
Thank you anyway.

566
00:33:36,495 --> 00:33:37,797
Would you step aside please?

567
00:33:39,816 --> 00:33:41,438
Your name please?
- Clara Stillwell.

568
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,141
I can use a sewing machine.

569
00:33:43,357 --> 00:33:44,715
But I think I'm a better cook.

570
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:46,796
Excuse me.

571
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:51,043
There must be something I can do.
Even if only for this afternoon.

572
00:33:51,727 --> 00:33:54,125
I would appreciate it if you
would find <i>some</i> task for me.

573
00:33:54,843 --> 00:33:56,488
That is the right spirit, Miss Williams.

574
00:33:57,848 --> 00:33:58,976
Mrs Bower.

575
00:33:59,316 --> 00:33:59,968
Yes?

576
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,350
You can use Miss Williams
here instead of the dummy.

577
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:04,988
Will you join them please.

578
00:34:08,228 --> 00:34:11,622
Now, girls. Don't get excited
because we have a live dummy.

579
00:34:12,114 --> 00:34:14,147
We must learn to keep our heads.

580
00:34:14,967 --> 00:34:16,246
Would you lie down?

581
00:34:20,344 --> 00:34:21,216
On your back.

582
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,032
There you are. That's fine.

583
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:28,013
Now, girls. Control yourselves.

584
00:34:28,803 --> 00:34:30,849
I'm going to make this a
friendly little competition.

585
00:34:31,241 --> 00:34:32,580
The left against the right.

586
00:34:33,311 --> 00:34:34,520
Left leg, are you ready?

587
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:35,961
Right leg?

588
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,013
Left arm. Right arm.

589
00:34:38,697 --> 00:34:39,824
Get ready.

590
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,207
Get set.

591
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,106
Go.

592
00:34:59,663 --> 00:35:01,883
You are stopping the
circulation in the right arm.

593
00:35:02,391 --> 00:35:03,851
The patient is getting no blood.

594
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,410
She is so anxious.

595
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,951
Later we are going to break your back.

596
00:35:14,773 --> 00:35:16,389
What do you mean, she's being bandaged?

597
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,618
What's happened?

598
00:35:18,091 --> 00:35:19,021
She is a dummy?

599
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,621
Who's a dummy?

600
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:22,991
Say, are you out of your mind?

601
00:35:24,078 --> 00:35:25,609
There's nothing to worry about, sir.

602
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,239
Take my word for it.

603
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:44,025
Want to know something?

604
00:35:44,954 --> 00:35:46,570
Children of people who used to be rich.

605
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,010
Have it pretty tough.
- What do I care?

606
00:35:58,407 --> 00:35:59,022
Say.

607
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:07,121
You're on our handball court.

608
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:08,578
I understand. Thank you.

609
00:36:10,529 --> 00:36:11,899
Patient, please.

610
00:36:14,189 --> 00:36:16,419
Mr Connelli says we have to
get the truck back by tonight.

611
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:18,712
The truck is on the handball court.

612
00:36:20,772 --> 00:36:23,768
Do you think two men could empty a
truckload of sand into sacks by tonight?

613
00:36:24,235 --> 00:36:26,445
I am sure they could.
- No, no.

614
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,000
It's our day off.

615
00:36:28,676 --> 00:36:30,591
I wonder where we could find two men.

616
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:32,584
You faint. I'll carry you off.

617
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:34,950
He's fainted. I'll take him to hospital.

618
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:43,120
This war stinks.

619
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:44,906
My back.

620
00:36:45,355 --> 00:36:46,943
Know what you boys should do?
- What?

621
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:50,059
Take a nice steam bath.
Keeps you from getting stiff.

622
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:52,180
Thanks. You got one on you?
- Sure.

623
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,627
Next to the boiler room.
I make it myself.

624
00:36:55,335 --> 00:36:56,179
Oh, brother.

625
00:36:57,675 --> 00:36:59,776
Keep the awareness of
danger alive in your group.

626
00:37:00,166 --> 00:37:02,586
Have frequent air raid rehearsals.
Practice blackouts.

627
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:04,812
Fight, fight the urge to relax.

628
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:08,165
Eternal vigilance, it has been
said by a better speech maker.

629
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:09,666
Is the price of liberty.

630
00:37:10,315 --> 00:37:12,446
I'm sorry we had to stay as
late as we did today, but ..

631
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:13,829
We made our quota.

632
00:37:14,164 --> 00:37:15,437
Tell that to your husbands.

633
00:37:24,657 --> 00:37:26,556
Turn me over, will you.
I'm done on this side.

634
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,448
The way I look at it, the
rich have a responsibility.

635
00:37:30,853 --> 00:37:32,890
To equip their children
for the practical world.

636
00:37:33,370 --> 00:37:34,700
I don't want to go to heaven.

637
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:35,780
I like heat.

638
00:37:36,928 --> 00:37:40,666
But Mrs Campbell, you've been having
two air raids a week here regularly.

639
00:37:41,069 --> 00:37:44,343
That's the point. We've been having
them regularly. Everybody expects them.

640
00:37:45,455 --> 00:37:48,545
After the last air raid, we had a
buffet supper for the whole building.

641
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:49,955
Right now.

642
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,698
Everybody is eating dinner.

643
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:54,139
This is the best time.
When they don't expect it.

644
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,452
Eternal vigilance is
the price of liberty.

645
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,223
I don't know.
- Mr. Mookle.

646
00:37:58,571 --> 00:38:00,432
Are you with us in this war or not?

647
00:38:02,271 --> 00:38:03,698
Have your air raid, ladies.

648
00:38:06,804 --> 00:38:07,883
Money is alright.

649
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,040
I'm not saying anything against money.

650
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:11,713
Money will be glad to hear it.

651
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:14,379
But if you've been raised
in the lap of luxury.

652
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:16,101
Can you fit yourself ..

653
00:38:18,693 --> 00:38:19,941
Can you fit yourself ..

654
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:24,420
Can you fit yourself ..

655
00:38:25,348 --> 00:38:27,336
What is that?
- Someone is playing with the switch.

656
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,552
It might be a short.
- Let's get out of here.

657
00:38:30,103 --> 00:38:31,200
Where's the door?

658
00:38:34,713 --> 00:38:36,719
Follow me. I'm a regular cat.
Take my hand.

659
00:38:38,543 --> 00:38:40,074
There ought to be another door here.

660
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:41,653
Here it is.

661
00:38:42,327 --> 00:38:43,657
Feel around for your clothes.

662
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,671
How you doing?
- I got a table.

663
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,288
Let's sit on it.
The lights will be on in a minute.

664
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:50,539
Lights.

665
00:38:58,162 --> 00:38:59,378
Dave's getting a stomach.

666
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:04,033
Who didn't have any clothes on?

667
00:39:04,813 --> 00:39:06,115
It was all an accident, sir.

668
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:08,368
She has not been out
of my sight a moment.

669
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,868
Right now, they are in
a Chinese restaurant.

670
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:15,296
It is a very reputable place, sir.

671
00:39:15,658 --> 00:39:16,931
I am sure the food is safe.

672
00:39:19,387 --> 00:39:20,145
Yes, sir.

673
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:23,067
Mary, go on where you left off.
About your experiences in New York.

674
00:39:23,296 --> 00:39:25,227
What happened after you
were fired as a waitress?

675
00:39:25,526 --> 00:39:26,175
Well.

676
00:39:27,313 --> 00:39:28,615
I didn't know where to turn.

677
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,082
How did you eat?

678
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:32,080
I didn't, very often.

679
00:39:32,901 --> 00:39:34,256
I got weaker and weaker.

680
00:39:35,398 --> 00:39:37,215
Finally, one day I was
walking in the street.

681
00:39:37,763 --> 00:39:40,088
And everything turned
black and I fainted.

682
00:39:41,111 --> 00:39:42,155
And when I woke up.

683
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,585
I was in the home of a kind old lady.

684
00:39:45,193 --> 00:39:47,440
And she took an interest
in me and got a job ..

685
00:39:48,538 --> 00:39:50,966
For me in San Francisco.
With her grandmother.

686
00:39:51,378 --> 00:39:53,166
And that's where I'm going.
To get this job.

687
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:54,803
As an upstairs maid.

688
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:56,739
With the old lady's grandmother?

689
00:39:57,634 --> 00:39:59,004
I mean, granddaughter.

690
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:01,938
The old lady is the grandmother.

691
00:40:02,322 --> 00:40:04,790
And the other one, the younger
one, is the granddaughter.

692
00:40:05,158 --> 00:40:06,774
Being an upstairs maid isn't easy work.

693
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:08,838
Well, anyway.

694
00:40:10,137 --> 00:40:11,730
Let's not talk about me anymore.

695
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,610
Right. We're getting her depressed.

696
00:40:14,039 --> 00:40:16,228
Let's talk about me.
What would you like to know about me?

697
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,289
Were you two ..

698
00:40:19,162 --> 00:40:20,644
Childhood sweethearts at school?

699
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:24,873
We had a very romantic courtship.
She picked me up one night on a bus.

700
00:40:25,113 --> 00:40:26,586
Are you going to start that again?

701
00:40:26,968 --> 00:40:30,000
We were sitting next to each other
and she had to get off at 149th Street.

702
00:40:30,448 --> 00:40:32,967
When she started to leave
her dress peculiarly enough ..

703
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:35,397
Caught on the button on my sleeve.
Get it?

704
00:40:35,762 --> 00:40:37,997
Very funny.
- It just wouldn't come loose.

705
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:41,399
She had to get off so I, like
a gentleman, got off too.

706
00:40:42,302 --> 00:40:45,811
When I opened my eyes ten days
later I was a cooked, married goose.

707
00:40:46,138 --> 00:40:47,670
You only knew each other ten days?

708
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:49,888
She said it was ten days. I was drugged.

709
00:40:50,773 --> 00:40:52,842
I haven't regretted it more
than half the time since.

710
00:40:53,228 --> 00:40:54,530
You can still get out of it.

711
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,987
I'm getting used to you.

712
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:57,846
You sure look cute in that dress.

713
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:00,530
It was .. something like that. It had ..

714
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:02,769
It had. Say.

715
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,235
Isn't that the same dress?

716
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:07,116
Yes it is.

717
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:10,068
Why are you wearing it tonight?

718
00:41:11,204 --> 00:41:12,839
Why do you think, you big lunk?

719
00:41:16,276 --> 00:41:19,295
Stand up. There is no law
against married people dancing.

720
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,337
Would you care to dance?

721
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:44,623
I would love to.

722
00:41:57,554 --> 00:41:59,027
You shouldn't be an upstairs maid.

723
00:42:00,421 --> 00:42:01,780
I've friends in San Francisco.

724
00:42:01,995 --> 00:42:03,783
When we get off the
plane I'll call them up.

725
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:05,840
You couldn't do that.

726
00:42:06,978 --> 00:42:08,308
I'm not leaving on the plane.

727
00:42:09,882 --> 00:42:10,629
Why not?

728
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:13,999
This old lady who's taken me in.

729
00:42:14,807 --> 00:42:16,376
Besides, she and her granddaughter.

730
00:42:17,027 --> 00:42:19,033
Are going on the train .. next week.

731
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,596
Then this will probably be
the last time I ever see you?

732
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,275
Yes it is.

733
00:42:32,919 --> 00:42:34,049
It's a little crowded.

734
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:35,624
Isn't it.

735
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:23,026
What are you thinking?

736
00:43:24,105 --> 00:43:25,329
Maybe if he had ten days.

737
00:43:42,238 --> 00:43:44,733
<i>Where the pomegranates used to grow</i>.

738
00:43:45,555 --> 00:43:48,367
<i>Nothing fools anymore</i>.

739
00:43:49,380 --> 00:43:52,334
<i>No-one smiles anymore</i>.

740
00:43:53,688 --> 00:43:56,642
<i>When the China moon begins to glow</i>.

741
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,929
<i>No-one sings anymore</i>.

742
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:07,053
<i>No-one but a lonely little maid</i>.

743
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:09,504
<i>Trembling</i>.

744
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,657
<i>And yet somehow</i>.

745
00:44:12,398 --> 00:44:14,009
<i>Unafraid</i>.

746
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:20,112
<i>Honorable moon</i>.

747
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:26,006
<i>Each night I sing a song of sorrow</i>.

748
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:29,680
<i>Honorable moon</i>.

749
00:44:30,822 --> 00:44:35,317
<i>How soon before the new tomorrow?</i>

750
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:41,096
<i>When we'll come at them too, we'll be</i>.

751
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:44,834
<i>And to broken lullabies</i>.

752
00:44:46,042 --> 00:44:48,305
<i>When will come an end</i>.

753
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:53,186
<i>To flaming dragons of a China</i> ..

754
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:55,313
<i>Sky</i>.

755
00:44:57,954 --> 00:44:59,840
<i>Honorable moon</i>.

756
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:05,752
<i>Smile on my man where he is fighting</i>.

757
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:11,468
<i>Fighting through the endless
night to keep the good earth free</i>.

758
00:45:13,572 --> 00:45:14,980
<i>And then</i>.

759
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:19,647
<i>When life is worth living</i>.

760
00:45:21,754 --> 00:45:23,675
<i>Send him home</i>.

761
00:45:25,466 --> 00:45:29,408
<i>Send him home to me</i>.

762
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:35,414
<i>May honorable day come soon</i>.

763
00:45:36,797 --> 00:45:38,864
<i>Honorable moon</i>.

764
00:45:50,172 --> 00:45:51,521
I am not crying.

765
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:53,191
Your nose is shiny.

766
00:45:55,295 --> 00:45:56,564
I'll meet you outside.

767
00:46:06,962 --> 00:46:07,863
Check, please.

768
00:46:09,532 --> 00:46:10,299
She is ..

769
00:46:11,067 --> 00:46:12,347
She is very sentimental.

770
00:46:13,242 --> 00:46:14,458
What do you think of her?

771
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:16,565
She's very good looking.
- I know.

772
00:46:17,013 --> 00:46:19,144
Yeah. I mean, what do you think of her?
Her character?

773
00:46:20,192 --> 00:46:23,324
To know a girl's character you got
to go with her a couple of years.

774
00:46:23,909 --> 00:46:26,371
You only knew Jean for ten days.
- I took a chance.

775
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:31,514
They say you never really know
a girl at all until you marry her.

776
00:46:33,588 --> 00:46:34,719
That's only a saying.

777
00:46:44,395 --> 00:46:46,302
I've got a funny hunch about something.

778
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:51,007
What with you being a refugee
and Eddie going away to war.

779
00:46:51,466 --> 00:46:53,777
Having two rum drinks in him
which will give him nerves.

780
00:46:54,736 --> 00:46:56,495
I think he's going to
ask you to marry him.

781
00:46:56,793 --> 00:46:57,809
What do you think?

782
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,017
I think he might.
- He's quite a guy.

783
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,388
I'm sure he's quite a guy.

784
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,398
On the other hand,
don't get your hopes up.

785
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:07,974
He may not.

786
00:47:10,053 --> 00:47:11,715
Will you answer me something truthfully?

787
00:47:12,593 --> 00:47:13,895
Do you wish he would ask me?

788
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:15,714
Yes.

789
00:47:16,572 --> 00:47:17,426
Thank you.

790
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:18,573
But.

791
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:21,066
I know more about you than he does.
- What do you mean?

792
00:47:22,685 --> 00:47:24,840
Girlie, I put you to bed last night.

793
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:27,899
Oh.

794
00:47:28,665 --> 00:47:29,394
You did?

795
00:47:30,689 --> 00:47:31,275
Oh.

796
00:47:39,801 --> 00:47:41,761
It's a nice night.
Would you like to walk a while?

797
00:47:41,976 --> 00:47:42,705
Alright.

798
00:47:43,448 --> 00:47:45,201
I'm sure you want us
to keep you company.

799
00:47:45,630 --> 00:47:46,467
Madame.

800
00:47:46,944 --> 00:47:48,940
If I don't see you again
it will be your own fault.

801
00:47:49,304 --> 00:47:50,695
Thank you .. for everything.

802
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:53,828
Goodbye.

803
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:55,521
Don't keep him out late.

804
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:57,860
If he falls asleep at the
controls I fall just as far.

805
00:47:58,437 --> 00:47:59,166
Goodbye.

806
00:48:04,087 --> 00:48:05,417
You're not tired or anything?

807
00:48:05,772 --> 00:48:06,959
No. I feel like walking.

808
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:20,852
You won't get into any
trouble staying out this late?

809
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,895
That old lady won't be angry?

810
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:24,018
No.

811
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:38,288
It's hot.

812
00:48:55,674 --> 00:48:56,947
Forget about San Francisco.

813
00:48:57,572 --> 00:48:58,874
We are going to get married.

814
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:01,207
Excuse me.

815
00:49:02,347 --> 00:49:03,474
Would you marry me?

816
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:05,465
I can't marry you.

817
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,259
Why can't you?

818
00:49:09,268 --> 00:49:10,254
I can't.

819
00:49:11,941 --> 00:49:12,748
Come here.

820
00:49:17,034 --> 00:49:18,026
Now listen.

821
00:49:18,761 --> 00:49:20,406
I never before asked a girl to marry me.

822
00:49:21,193 --> 00:49:22,525
I swear it.
- I believe you.

823
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:25,078
You like me, don't you?
- Yes. I do.

824
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:28,365
That's enough to start on. People never
know each other until they are married.

825
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,626
We can have dates for a year
and not know each other.

826
00:49:30,863 --> 00:49:32,308
That may be.
- Give me a chance.

827
00:49:32,949 --> 00:49:35,735
This war won't go on forever. I don't
know if I'll be able to find you later.

828
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,600
I promised the company
I'd work another two weeks.

829
00:49:39,952 --> 00:49:42,469
After that, I still have five days
before I'm in the air force.

830
00:49:43,214 --> 00:49:44,745
We'll have those five days together.

831
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:47,168
Then I'll have some leaves
and we can be together then.

832
00:49:47,754 --> 00:49:49,542
When we're separated
we'll write each other.

833
00:49:49,961 --> 00:49:51,816
The most important thing
of all is someday ..

834
00:49:52,649 --> 00:49:53,682
I'll be back.

835
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:55,958
I want you waiting for me.

836
00:49:58,550 --> 00:49:59,946
No. I can't.

837
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,156
I want to go home.
- I know it's sudden. It is for me too.

838
00:50:03,487 --> 00:50:06,199
I'll tell you everything about me.
I am conservative. I don't drink.

839
00:50:06,892 --> 00:50:08,136
I have $1,200 in the bank.

840
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,702
We'll get a little apartment.
- Please don't go on.

841
00:50:12,021 --> 00:50:13,504
Is it on account of your parents?

842
00:50:14,903 --> 00:50:15,767
In a way.

843
00:50:16,695 --> 00:50:17,968
I can support your parents.

844
00:50:22,717 --> 00:50:23,727
Now, honey.

845
00:50:28,765 --> 00:50:30,439
Thank you for asking me to marry you.

846
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:32,607
I will remember it.

847
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:34,948
For the rest of my life.

848
00:50:36,045 --> 00:50:38,945
Look. I don't know what's inside that
head of yours but we're getting married.

849
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,259
I won't leave you until it's settled.

850
00:50:41,574 --> 00:50:43,620
You're marrying me. You hear me?
You are marrying me.

851
00:50:44,669 --> 00:50:46,457
I want to hear you say
you <i>want</i> to marry me.

852
00:50:47,225 --> 00:50:48,126
Go on, say it.

853
00:50:48,632 --> 00:50:49,333
Say it.

854
00:50:50,794 --> 00:50:52,082
I want to marry you.

855
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:01,394
You'll never be sorry.

856
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,775
Now, there's some things
we have to arrange.

857
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:11,600
I'll be back the day after tomorrow.
Where can I call you?

858
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,326
Let me call you. It will be
easier because of the old lady.

859
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:15,845
Okay.

860
00:51:19,922 --> 00:51:20,966
Here is the number.

861
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:24,412
I get in at eight in the morning.
I'll be by the phone at 8:20 waiting.

862
00:51:35,589 --> 00:51:36,544
What number?

863
00:51:40,107 --> 00:51:41,304
Let me get out here.

864
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,203
The old lady might be
waiting in front of the house.

865
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:45,415
Okay, honey.

866
00:52:08,096 --> 00:52:09,455
I'll be waiting for your call.

867
00:52:10,129 --> 00:52:11,390
I'll call you.

868
00:52:12,922 --> 00:52:13,709
Goodnight.

869
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:31,178
Can I come in?
- Yes. Certainly.

870
00:52:40,021 --> 00:52:41,708
Hope I didn't wake you up.
- No.

871
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:44,553
I got something to tell you.

872
00:52:44,937 --> 00:52:45,623
No.

873
00:52:46,673 --> 00:52:48,510
Eddie.
- Congratulations.

874
00:52:49,078 --> 00:52:50,497
You know what I want to say?

875
00:52:50,771 --> 00:52:52,586
How'd she do it?
Her dress catch your sleeve?

876
00:52:52,801 --> 00:52:55,415
I had a hard time convincing her.
- That's the way they do it.

877
00:52:55,801 --> 00:52:57,332
You chase them until they catch you.

878
00:52:59,894 --> 00:53:01,425
I thought maybe you'd help me, Jean.

879
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:03,882
I haven't much time.
- Sure. What do you want me to do?

880
00:53:04,225 --> 00:53:06,946
I want you to pick out an engagement
ring for me. And a marriage ring.

881
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,704
You think she needs an engagement ring?

882
00:53:10,245 --> 00:53:10,860
Yes.

883
00:53:11,412 --> 00:53:12,464
Nothing fancy.

884
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:14,412
About a hundred dollars.

885
00:53:14,818 --> 00:53:15,748
That's alright?

886
00:53:15,963 --> 00:53:17,162
It won't be vulgar.

887
00:53:17,883 --> 00:53:19,585
You know girls.
That's important to them.

888
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:22,648
I must have a place for her to live too.
Mine is kinda ..

889
00:53:23,293 --> 00:53:26,781
There's a lovely apartment in this
building and it's leased furnished.

890
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:28,052
Really?

891
00:53:28,734 --> 00:53:31,482
The only thing is, the people are
taking their icebox with them.

892
00:53:32,141 --> 00:53:33,877
And you just can't get an icebox.

893
00:53:34,205 --> 00:53:36,479
What good is a place with no icebox?
She must have an icebox.

894
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:37,630
Take it easy.

895
00:53:37,992 --> 00:53:39,895
It's ridiculous.
She can't be without an icebox.

896
00:53:40,234 --> 00:53:42,265
I'll look around tomorrow.
Maybe I can find one.

897
00:53:42,575 --> 00:53:44,363
Please do. She can't live
without an icebox.

898
00:53:44,672 --> 00:53:47,633
Holy mackerel. Go home. You're making
me nervous. Jean will do everything.

899
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,145
I am not nervous.

900
00:53:49,984 --> 00:53:51,457
I might be a little excited but ..

901
00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:53,143
Not nervous.

902
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,236
You thought I was going
to walk into the closet.

903
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:02,566
That's too old.

904
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:04,260
Well.

905
00:54:05,124 --> 00:54:06,288
Goodnight.
- Night.

906
00:54:16,018 --> 00:54:17,112
You're not nervous.

907
00:54:20,789 --> 00:54:21,576
Goodnight.

908
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:56,603
Of course, it's incomplete.
We've not had much time.

909
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:57,984
But so far.

910
00:54:58,509 --> 00:54:59,610
'Edward J. O'Rourke'.

911
00:55:00,098 --> 00:55:02,369
'Born November 7th, 1914
in Brooklyn, New York'.

912
00:55:02,801 --> 00:55:05,989
'Attended public school, high school
and worked his way through college'.

913
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:09,014
'Had measles, mumps and other
usual childhood illnesses'.

914
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:12,381
'Employed in his present position as
commercial pilot for four years'.

915
00:55:12,773 --> 00:55:15,879
'Considered by his company as
sober, industrious and dependable'.

916
00:55:16,534 --> 00:55:19,176
'Enlisted in the US Army
Air Force. Accepted'.

917
00:55:19,626 --> 00:55:21,296
'Due for induction late this month'.

918
00:55:21,654 --> 00:55:22,469
His family.

919
00:55:22,684 --> 00:55:25,023
'One of nine boys. All living'.
- Nine boys?

920
00:55:25,393 --> 00:55:27,666
Yes, sir. His father is
one of eleven boys.

921
00:55:28,075 --> 00:55:29,886
Eleven? All boys?
- Yes, sir.

922
00:55:30,839 --> 00:55:31,740
Extraordinary.

923
00:55:32,054 --> 00:55:33,535
Yes, sir. But it happens.

924
00:55:34,076 --> 00:55:34,977
Shall I go on?

925
00:55:35,289 --> 00:55:36,072
Proceed.

926
00:55:36,376 --> 00:55:38,479
'Played second base for his
high school baseball team'.

927
00:55:38,832 --> 00:55:41,890
'Had 3 stitches in his head after diving
in the shallow side of swimming pool'.

928
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:43,502
When he was twelve.

929
00:55:43,780 --> 00:55:44,395
And.

930
00:55:44,752 --> 00:55:45,905
He has all his teeth.

931
00:55:46,453 --> 00:55:48,384
We'll have more detailed
information later today.

932
00:55:49,219 --> 00:55:52,144
Call the state department. Say I want
to speak with His Majesty in London.

933
00:55:52,488 --> 00:55:53,246
Yes, sir.

934
00:55:53,746 --> 00:55:55,391
Thank you, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

935
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:09,897
I hope it's nothing serious.

936
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:11,507
Hello.

937
00:56:11,788 --> 00:56:12,709
This is Mary.

938
00:56:13,435 --> 00:56:15,947
I didn't want to wait until
tomorrow to call you.

939
00:56:16,346 --> 00:56:18,483
I was thinking about you, Mary. All day.

940
00:56:18,828 --> 00:56:20,625
Come on. Hurry that call.

941
00:56:21,191 --> 00:56:25,043
I want you to know I will always
remember you asking me to marry you.

942
00:56:25,476 --> 00:56:26,189
Always.

943
00:56:26,499 --> 00:56:28,625
Honey, you're sweet to call
but I'm in kind-of a hurry.

944
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,821
Kind of a hurry?

945
00:56:30,036 --> 00:56:30,760
Listen.

946
00:56:31,036 --> 00:56:33,356
I can't listen. Please look for
an icebox. That's all we need.

947
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:35,357
Hang up that phone.
- Goodbye, honey.

948
00:56:41,842 --> 00:56:43,494
It had to happen, Your Majesty.

949
00:56:44,169 --> 00:56:46,343
With a girl her age
you only have to wait.

950
00:56:46,957 --> 00:56:48,688
A boy will get to her
like a bee to honey.

951
00:56:50,126 --> 00:56:51,485
I'm sure it's the right thing.

952
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:54,736
After all, the major purpose
of a royal marriage ..

953
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:57,227
Is to cement relations
between two countries.

954
00:56:58,105 --> 00:56:59,035
He is American.

955
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,235
A country we are certainly
eager to cement with.

956
00:57:01,748 --> 00:57:03,107
And they have no royal family.

957
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:06,407
I've known for thirty years
we would come to this.

958
00:57:07,151 --> 00:57:09,608
Frankly, I was hoping for one
of the sons of the president.

959
00:57:10,329 --> 00:57:11,516
But my feeling now is ..

960
00:57:11,888 --> 00:57:14,691
It is even cleverer for Maria
to marry a simple commoner.

961
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:16,542
His family?

962
00:57:17,127 --> 00:57:18,654
Your Majesty, it is extraordinary.

963
00:57:19,551 --> 00:57:22,270
This young man is a
veritable goldmine of boys.

964
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:25,110
His family doesn't seem to
give birth to anything else.

965
00:57:25,613 --> 00:57:26,571
Between us, sir.

966
00:57:27,015 --> 00:57:29,540
The nobility bloodlines in
Europe are getting rather thin.

967
00:57:30,021 --> 00:57:31,151
Everybody is bleeding.

968
00:57:34,612 --> 00:57:36,514
Thank you for your
confidence, Your Majesty.

969
00:57:50,096 --> 00:57:50,768
Hello?

970
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,251
Honey, don't tell me
you've got an icebox.

971
00:57:54,230 --> 00:57:55,286
I want you to know.

972
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:58,664
I will always remember you
asking me to marry you.

973
00:57:59,113 --> 00:58:01,828
That's fine. You didn't have to call me
long-distance. Sweet of you anyway.

974
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:04,120
I have to run, dear. See you tomorrow.

975
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:06,054
No, no. You won't see me tomorrow.

976
00:58:06,511 --> 00:58:07,813
You will never see me again.

977
00:58:08,292 --> 00:58:11,156
I only promised to call you
so you'd let me go last night.

978
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:13,318
Listen, honey.

979
00:58:13,533 --> 00:58:16,283
If this is a feminine reaction to the
way I asked you, you must overlook it.

980
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:18,992
I love you. That's all to think about.
- Are you going to hang up?

981
00:58:19,488 --> 00:58:20,674
No. You don't love me.

982
00:58:21,147 --> 00:58:25,205
You pitied me because I'm a homeless
refugee and have to be an upstairs maid.

983
00:58:25,512 --> 00:58:27,342
That is all. You will forget about me.

984
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:31,987
But I want you to know I'll always
remember you asking me to marry you.

985
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:33,944
It was the proudest moment.

986
00:58:34,332 --> 00:58:36,916
Stop repeating that. Honey, I want
you waiting for me when I come in.

987
00:58:37,397 --> 00:58:39,071
Give me that phone.
- Listen. I say yes.

988
00:58:39,354 --> 00:58:40,827
I want you waiting at the airport.

989
00:58:41,735 --> 00:58:42,607
Hello, hello.

990
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,032
Get in that plane, O'Rourke.

991
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,437
Did she give you any reason?

992
00:59:00,644 --> 00:59:01,230
No.

993
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:05,340
I tell you, something has happened.

994
00:59:06,424 --> 00:59:07,783
She loves me. I know she does.

995
00:59:09,124 --> 00:59:10,855
That may sound funny
after one day, but ..

996
00:59:11,449 --> 00:59:13,495
I tell you, last night that
girl was in love with me.

997
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:15,516
I could not be wrong.

998
00:59:16,402 --> 00:59:18,133
Maybe she'll call you
at the next airport.

999
00:59:18,879 --> 00:59:19,551
Maybe.

1000
00:59:21,574 --> 00:59:22,246
Go on.

1001
00:59:22,624 --> 00:59:23,382
Fly away.

1002
00:59:24,798 --> 00:59:25,470
Go on.

1003
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:26,887
It won't, Maria.

1004
00:59:27,382 --> 00:59:29,026
It's been caged for so many generations.

1005
00:59:29,409 --> 00:59:30,968
It has adapted itself to confinement.

1006
00:59:31,842 --> 00:59:34,017
Luckily, it doesn't know
of the joys of wild birds.

1007
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,426
Therefore it doesn't realise
it's missing anything.

1008
00:59:36,707 --> 00:59:37,322
Yes.

1009
00:59:37,864 --> 00:59:38,994
Not knowing is better.

1010
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:42,591
Maria, we must discuss something to
which I've given a good deal of thought.

1011
00:59:43,034 --> 00:59:43,935
Your marriage.

1012
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:46,195
Please, Uncle. Not now.
- Will only take a minute.

1013
00:59:47,058 --> 00:59:48,829
In view of the disturbed
world conditions.

1014
00:59:49,511 --> 00:59:51,800
And the greater need for
advantageous alliances.

1015
00:59:52,713 --> 00:59:55,569
Do you think it would be ridiculous
for you to marry an American boy?

1016
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,410
I'd like to have your opinion.

1017
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:01,434
Mine?

1018
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:05,313
There may be a lot in what you say.

1019
01:00:05,828 --> 01:00:08,150
Sometimes I think it's a good idea.
Sometimes I don't.

1020
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:09,845
It's awfully clever.

1021
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:12,258
Politically, I mean.
- Politically, eh?

1022
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:13,605
Awfully clever.

1023
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:15,911
It still couldn't be just anyone.

1024
01:00:16,758 --> 01:00:17,344
No.

1025
01:00:17,658 --> 01:00:20,582
Once we make up our minds on an
American boy. And we haven't yet.

1026
01:00:21,001 --> 01:00:21,587
No.

1027
01:00:21,992 --> 01:00:23,998
It would have to conform
to a certain pattern.

1028
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:25,175
Yes.

1029
01:00:25,879 --> 01:00:28,113
An ordinary American boy who
works for a living is best.

1030
01:00:28,328 --> 01:00:30,014
Don't you think?
- That would be best.

1031
01:00:30,366 --> 01:00:32,746
He needs to have a job
somewhat romantic and dashing.

1032
01:00:33,092 --> 01:00:34,615
It will sit better with the public.

1033
01:00:34,925 --> 01:00:36,084
Yes. It can sit better.

1034
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,552
For instance, if he were a
dentist it wouldn't do at all.

1035
01:00:38,895 --> 01:00:39,892
No. It wouldn't.

1036
01:00:40,232 --> 01:00:42,860
Nothing wrong with a dentist.
It's a necessary vocation.

1037
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:43,871
It is.

1038
01:00:44,271 --> 01:00:46,293
The world would be
uncomfortable without them.

1039
01:00:46,658 --> 01:00:47,937
But it is too prosaic.

1040
01:00:48,412 --> 01:00:49,970
It's terribly prosaic.

1041
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:53,294
On the other hand,
aren't we being hasty?

1042
01:00:54,196 --> 01:00:57,783
A dentist might be just the right
prosaic note that people would like.

1043
01:00:58,253 --> 01:01:00,655
I don't think a dentist is a good idea.

1044
01:01:01,181 --> 01:01:03,281
You don't?
- No. A dentist is too ..

1045
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:05,277
You are right.

1046
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:07,722
I wonder what would be ideal.

1047
01:01:08,528 --> 01:01:09,286
A lawyer?

1048
01:01:09,776 --> 01:01:11,772
No. A lawyer is too ..

1049
01:01:12,436 --> 01:01:13,480
Maybe you're right.

1050
01:01:14,488 --> 01:01:16,272
A schoolteacher?
- No.

1051
01:01:16,768 --> 01:01:17,681
Too ..

1052
01:01:18,822 --> 01:01:19,474
Yes.

1053
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:21,535
Let me see.

1054
01:01:22,676 --> 01:01:25,357
An airplane pilot? No.
- Yes. Oh yes.

1055
01:01:26,035 --> 01:01:28,113
I think an airplane pilot might be.

1056
01:01:28,735 --> 01:01:29,439
You do?

1057
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:30,992
I do, Uncle. I do.

1058
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:34,305
The moment you said it, it
just seemed to strike me.

1059
01:01:34,983 --> 01:01:36,448
Well, that's a good sign.

1060
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,613
I wonder what his name ought to be.

1061
01:01:40,058 --> 01:01:41,045
His name?
- Yes.

1062
01:01:41,390 --> 01:01:43,174
Some names are more
appealing than others.

1063
01:01:43,776 --> 01:01:47,121
You'll decide what his name must be and
then look for a pilot with that name?

1064
01:01:47,535 --> 01:01:49,215
Why not?
- That's impossible.

1065
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:50,394
No it isn't.

1066
01:01:50,702 --> 01:01:52,617
Let me see. What name sounds appealing?

1067
01:01:53,628 --> 01:01:55,943
How does Edward O'Rourke sound to you?

1068
01:01:56,355 --> 01:01:58,817
Uncle, it is absolutely
impossible to expect ..

1069
01:02:01,945 --> 01:02:03,275
What seems to be the trouble?

1070
01:02:06,425 --> 01:02:08,037
Uncle, sometimes you frighten me.

1071
01:02:09,001 --> 01:02:11,506
I couldn't have picked a
better husband myself, Maria.

1072
01:02:12,881 --> 01:02:16,591
Do you know he's one of nine boys
and his father is one of eleven?

1073
01:02:17,505 --> 01:02:19,220
We expect great things of you two.

1074
01:02:19,877 --> 01:02:21,740
You mean, I can actually marry him?

1075
01:02:22,474 --> 01:02:24,889
I am allowed to?
- Indeed you can.

1076
01:02:28,259 --> 01:02:29,924
I am not going to cry now.

1077
01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:39,224
I want to speak to Mr Washburn
in the US State Department.

1078
01:02:39,745 --> 01:02:40,503
Yes, sir.

1079
01:02:46,249 --> 01:02:47,436
You left the cage open.

1080
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,841
Maybe she'll call you at home.
She has your number.

1081
01:02:58,759 --> 01:02:59,431
Hello?

1082
01:03:00,168 --> 01:03:00,783
Yep.

1083
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:05,089
Honey, listen to me.
I want you .. Hello?

1084
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:07,133
Jean?

1085
01:03:07,994 --> 01:03:08,956
It's Jean.

1086
01:03:10,375 --> 01:03:11,505
She's found an icebox.

1087
01:03:12,273 --> 01:03:13,181
That's fine.

1088
01:03:13,632 --> 01:03:14,962
Jean, something has happened.

1089
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:17,737
I have to talk to her.
I don't know where she lives.

1090
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:20,207
Go to the company's accounts department.

1091
01:03:20,586 --> 01:03:23,601
And see if they'll give you the address
of the old lady who paid for her ticket.

1092
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:27,084
She may have paid by check.
If she did, they'll have her address.

1093
01:03:28,246 --> 01:03:29,405
Will you do that, Jean?

1094
01:03:30,528 --> 01:03:31,229
Thanks.

1095
01:03:32,634 --> 01:03:34,834
She'll get it. You know Jean.
She's a regular detective.

1096
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:37,694
Hello?

1097
01:03:38,204 --> 01:03:38,819
Yep.

1098
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:41,268
Hello?

1099
01:03:41,855 --> 01:03:42,670
Hello Mary?

1100
01:03:43,435 --> 01:03:45,663
Please meet me tomorrow and
at least let me talk to you.

1101
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:47,958
If you want me too.
Where shall I meet you?

1102
01:03:48,403 --> 01:03:49,866
Any place you say. Would ..

1103
01:03:50,342 --> 01:03:51,815
Would Jean's apartment be alright?

1104
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:53,487
Tomorrow morning?

1105
01:03:53,702 --> 01:03:55,282
You know where it is? You're sure?

1106
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:57,616
Alright, Mary. I'll be waiting for you.

1107
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,268
Goodbye, Mary.

1108
01:04:01,485 --> 01:04:02,690
That's something.

1109
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:07,181
He is so considerate.

1110
01:04:08,677 --> 01:04:10,563
Did I tell you he is one of nine boys?

1111
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,205
He isn't only considerate.

1112
01:04:13,153 --> 01:04:14,419
He is so sincere.

1113
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:16,945
His father is one of eleven boys.

1114
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:18,683
You know what this is?

1115
01:04:19,263 --> 01:04:20,364
The Cinderella story.

1116
01:04:20,746 --> 01:04:23,139
Only the boy is Cinderella.
It's just turned about.

1117
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:24,916
A rich princess and a poor boy.

1118
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,899
He isn't penniless.

1119
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,346
He has $1,200.

1120
01:04:28,844 --> 01:04:29,659
He has, eh?

1121
01:04:30,524 --> 01:04:31,711
That will come in handy.

1122
01:04:32,426 --> 01:04:35,238
I know very few women in
our family married well.

1123
01:04:35,943 --> 01:04:36,844
Only for love.

1124
01:04:37,465 --> 01:04:38,943
I certainly never counted on it.

1125
01:04:39,506 --> 01:04:41,323
I never would even let
myself think about it.

1126
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:43,540
Not since I was a little girl.

1127
01:04:44,269 --> 01:04:45,447
One of nine boys.

1128
01:04:46,565 --> 01:04:47,639
Extraordinary.

1129
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:50,044
I'm not entitled to be this happy.

1130
01:04:50,802 --> 01:04:52,165
His father one of eleven.

1131
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:54,739
Remarkable.

1132
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:13,475
Hello baby.

1133
01:05:14,591 --> 01:05:16,611
I thought I'd welcome you.
- That's what I like.

1134
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:17,618
Hi Eddie.

1135
01:05:17,833 --> 01:05:20,063
Jean, we'd better hurry.
Mary's meeting me at your place.

1136
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:21,360
She is?

1137
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,549
Are you sure?

1138
01:05:22,827 --> 01:05:24,243
She called right after you did.

1139
01:05:25,895 --> 01:05:26,939
What is the matter?

1140
01:05:27,939 --> 01:05:28,668
Nothing.

1141
01:05:29,134 --> 01:05:30,056
Come on, Jean.

1142
01:05:31,064 --> 01:05:32,464
You're sure you want to hear?

1143
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,261
If it's about her I want to hear it.

1144
01:05:37,816 --> 01:05:41,125
Her ticket wasn't paid for by a woman
but by a man. A middle-aged man.

1145
01:05:41,682 --> 01:05:44,503
She lives at the St. Charles in
a private apartment in the hotel.

1146
01:05:45,651 --> 01:05:47,640
The apartment is registered in his name.

1147
01:06:05,606 --> 01:06:07,566
She wouldn't marry me.
I give her credit for that.

1148
01:06:07,905 --> 01:06:09,006
I respect her for it.

1149
01:06:09,624 --> 01:06:11,106
A poor homeless refugee.

1150
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:13,601
Who knows what she went through?

1151
01:06:19,549 --> 01:06:21,143
If she confesses, I'll forgive her.

1152
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:22,751
Gladly.

1153
01:06:24,177 --> 01:06:26,753
I only ask her to tell me the truth
and that's all I'm entitled to.

1154
01:06:27,372 --> 01:06:28,273
Who am I to ..

1155
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,287
Come on.

1156
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,255
Hello Mary. Won't you come in?

1157
01:06:36,738 --> 01:06:37,553
Hello Mary.

1158
01:06:38,173 --> 01:06:39,191
Hello Jean.

1159
01:06:39,658 --> 01:06:40,354
Dave.

1160
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:43,411
Hello Eddie.

1161
01:06:44,096 --> 01:06:44,911
Hello Mary.

1162
01:06:45,355 --> 01:06:46,879
We must be going. Excuse us.

1163
01:06:47,395 --> 01:06:49,669
We have to see a fellow. You see ..
- Come on, dear.

1164
01:06:53,044 --> 01:06:53,888
Won't you ..

1165
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:55,500
Sit down?

1166
01:06:58,489 --> 01:07:01,618
It was nice of you to come here.
- Nice of you to insist I come.

1167
01:07:04,343 --> 01:07:06,843
Before you go any further,
there's something I'd better tell you.

1168
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:08,267
What?

1169
01:07:09,904 --> 01:07:11,234
I have changed my mind again.

1170
01:07:12,057 --> 01:07:13,044
I will marry you.

1171
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:15,408
You will?

1172
01:07:16,853 --> 01:07:18,269
Unless you've changed your mind?

1173
01:07:19,214 --> 01:07:20,573
You needn't be ashamed to say.

1174
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:21,692
No, no.

1175
01:07:22,047 --> 01:07:23,406
Do you still want to marry me?

1176
01:07:24,268 --> 01:07:25,442
Yes. Certainly.

1177
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:28,132
I couldn't understand why you
changed your mind before.

1178
01:07:29,602 --> 01:07:30,754
Then I imagine you ..

1179
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:32,813
Have your reasons.

1180
01:07:33,819 --> 01:07:35,208
Aren't you going to kiss me?

1181
01:07:37,905 --> 01:07:38,692
Of course.

1182
01:07:48,624 --> 01:07:49,714
Don't you feel well?

1183
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,208
I feel fine.

1184
01:07:53,087 --> 01:07:53,702
Now.

1185
01:07:54,294 --> 01:07:55,403
One more thing.

1186
01:07:56,124 --> 01:07:57,948
I can't accept your offer of marriage.

1187
01:07:58,284 --> 01:08:00,613
Until you know something about
that you don't even suspect.

1188
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:03,232
I haven't told you the
truth about myself.

1189
01:08:04,879 --> 01:08:06,352
You don't have to tell me a thing.

1190
01:08:06,620 --> 01:08:07,893
But I do.
- But you don't.

1191
01:08:08,660 --> 01:08:11,246
I want you to come with me to
the St. Charles Hotel. Please.

1192
01:08:12,376 --> 01:08:14,708
Can't you tell me here?
- It's better if you come to the hotel.

1193
01:08:17,556 --> 01:08:18,983
Mary, I want you to know ..

1194
01:08:19,402 --> 01:08:20,675
You will never regret this.

1195
01:08:26,364 --> 01:08:27,179
Come, dear.

1196
01:08:49,312 --> 01:08:50,239
Hold my hand.

1197
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:11,263
Mr O'Rourke - Mr Holman.

1198
01:09:11,719 --> 01:09:13,423
Mr Washburn.
- How do you do.

1199
01:09:14,491 --> 01:09:15,392
How do you do.

1200
01:09:16,549 --> 01:09:18,189
This is the man I am going to marry.

1201
01:09:19,969 --> 01:09:21,055
Any objections?

1202
01:09:22,171 --> 01:09:22,861
No.

1203
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:25,902
I guess this is a surprise to you.

1204
01:09:27,365 --> 01:09:27,951
No.

1205
01:09:29,250 --> 01:09:31,353
Mr O'Rourke, would you care
to step into the next room?

1206
01:09:34,536 --> 01:09:35,237
Gladly.

1207
01:09:36,487 --> 01:09:37,960
If he makes a move to you, holler.

1208
01:09:56,858 --> 01:09:58,934
I hope he tells it to
him diplomatically.

1209
01:09:59,498 --> 01:10:02,150
Mr Washburn is a member of the
United States state department.

1210
01:10:02,713 --> 01:10:03,843
He will be diplomatic.

1211
01:10:04,772 --> 01:10:06,212
I hope he doesn't faint.

1212
01:10:07,447 --> 01:10:08,463
[ Crashing noise ]

1213
01:10:12,295 --> 01:10:14,217
I just bumped into a small table.

1214
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,079
I could not be happier.

1215
01:10:20,523 --> 01:10:21,915
I think I hear them, father.

1216
01:10:22,299 --> 01:10:23,469
He is coming out now.

1217
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:25,155
One minute, father.

1218
01:10:30,061 --> 01:10:31,620
My father would like to speak to you.

1219
01:10:33,335 --> 01:10:34,583
Your father?

1220
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:37,603
He is in London.
Call him 'Your Majesty'.

1221
01:10:51,237 --> 01:10:51,909
Hello.

1222
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:53,020
Hello?

1223
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:56,062
Hello Your Majesty.

1224
01:10:58,314 --> 01:10:59,314
Thank you.

1225
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,889
I saw you in the newsreel.

1226
01:11:04,971 --> 01:11:05,729
Yes, sir.

1227
01:11:07,468 --> 01:11:09,227
I heard a click.
The three minutes were up.

1228
01:11:10,503 --> 01:11:11,451
Hello, hello.

1229
01:11:27,651 --> 01:11:29,182
I guess you're not working tomorrow.

1230
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,697
No. Mr Washburn of the state
department fixed it with the company.

1231
01:11:33,425 --> 01:11:34,584
He's got a lot of pull.

1232
01:11:35,478 --> 01:11:37,914
What about the air force?
- He fixed that too.

1233
01:11:38,922 --> 01:11:40,708
He says I'm going to
do something important.

1234
01:11:41,382 --> 01:11:42,712
You'll probably be a general.

1235
01:11:43,493 --> 01:11:44,938
What shall I do about the icebox?

1236
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:46,756
I don't think you'll need it.

1237
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:48,463
Maybe you can sell it.

1238
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:51,252
Don't you think I should at least
take the engagement ring back?

1239
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:56,269
It isn't a very big diamond, is it?

1240
01:11:56,988 --> 01:11:58,412
I can get the money back.

1241
01:11:59,508 --> 01:12:00,981
No. I ought to give her something.

1242
01:12:01,812 --> 01:12:03,396
She ought to be here any minute.

1243
01:12:04,032 --> 01:12:05,625
What does a Prince Consort do?

1244
01:12:06,312 --> 01:12:08,472
I don't know yet, but that's
what he told me I would be.

1245
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:11,460
Mr Washburn says I am doing a
wonderful thing for morale.

1246
01:12:12,203 --> 01:12:13,333
He is representing me.

1247
01:12:14,165 --> 01:12:14,837
Hello.

1248
01:12:19,443 --> 01:12:20,115
Hello.

1249
01:12:21,963 --> 01:12:23,408
I guess this is quite a surprise.

1250
01:12:24,379 --> 01:12:25,981
Yes it is, Your Highness.

1251
01:12:26,456 --> 01:12:27,672
Yes it is, Your Highness.

1252
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,143
He was surprised too.

1253
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:31,654
Yes I was, Your Highness. I mean ..

1254
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:33,598
Young man.

1255
01:12:33,813 --> 01:12:35,631
You've just been invited
to the White House.

1256
01:12:38,251 --> 01:12:39,095
White House?

1257
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:41,578
I kept it for you.
I hope that was alright.

1258
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:43,354
Yes. Fine.

1259
01:12:44,394 --> 01:12:45,964
Mr and Mrs Campbell - Mr Holman.

1260
01:12:46,548 --> 01:12:47,907
Mr Washburn.
- How do you do.

1261
01:12:48,427 --> 01:12:50,908
I imagine you never expected to
sleep in the White House, young man.

1262
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,099
No, sir.

1263
01:12:52,314 --> 01:12:54,479
It's very considerate of
the president to do that.

1264
01:12:54,857 --> 01:12:56,702
The president probably
wants to look him over.

1265
01:12:57,847 --> 01:12:59,149
I think we have to be going.

1266
01:12:59,515 --> 01:13:00,588
Yeah. We have to go.

1267
01:13:02,137 --> 01:13:03,353
I'll see you to the door.

1268
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:05,303
Goodbye. Glad to have met you.

1269
01:13:05,637 --> 01:13:06,848
Likewise.
- Goodbye.

1270
01:13:09,809 --> 01:13:10,538
Goodbye.

1271
01:13:14,039 --> 01:13:15,913
I'll be right back.
I'm only going to the door.

1272
01:13:33,928 --> 01:13:34,858
So long, Eddie.

1273
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:36,103
Lots of luck.

1274
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,953
When will I see you again?
- Maybe when you come back.

1275
01:13:39,622 --> 01:13:42,010
I doubt I can call you 'Eddie' though.
Probably: 'Your Highness'.

1276
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:43,862
No. I will only be a prince.

1277
01:13:44,647 --> 01:13:45,577
Goodbye, Eddie.

1278
01:13:47,247 --> 01:13:48,034
Bye, Jean.

1279
01:13:50,279 --> 01:13:51,552
Bye, Dave.
- So long, kid.

1280
01:13:52,256 --> 01:13:53,580
Take care of yourself.

1281
01:14:05,825 --> 01:14:06,674
Prince.

1282
01:14:08,167 --> 01:14:09,039
Here, Prince.

1283
01:14:20,423 --> 01:14:21,267
The Duke?

1284
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:23,794
Your Grace.
- The Baron.

1285
01:14:25,175 --> 01:14:26,614
Your Lordship.
- The Baronet.

1286
01:14:28,084 --> 01:14:28,854
Your ..

1287
01:14:29,594 --> 01:14:31,584
Excellency?
- 'Sir'. Plain Sir.

1288
01:14:32,024 --> 01:14:33,328
Sorry.
- It will come.

1289
01:14:33,643 --> 01:14:36,007
In a few months everyone will think
you were born to the purple.

1290
01:14:36,437 --> 01:14:38,235
Purple what?
- Just purple.

1291
01:14:38,851 --> 01:14:39,752
It's a saying.

1292
01:14:40,966 --> 01:14:43,444
Why can't I see Mary .. Maria ..

1293
01:14:44,245 --> 01:14:45,117
Her Highness?

1294
01:14:45,434 --> 01:14:47,737
Her uncle expects you to see
little of her until the ceremony.

1295
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:49,155
It is customary.

1296
01:14:50,122 --> 01:14:52,081
Will he have much to say
after we are married?

1297
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:55,003
Royalty is very strict
about age and precedence.

1298
01:14:56,617 --> 01:15:00,269
I don't think that's such a terrible
price to pay for $150,000 a year.

1299
01:15:01,273 --> 01:15:03,923
That's your allowance.
Besides your normal living expenses.

1300
01:15:04,724 --> 01:15:05,776
It is customary.

1301
01:15:08,723 --> 01:15:10,282
A lot of things seem to be customary.

1302
01:15:10,836 --> 01:15:13,891
You're unhappy because you're marrying
a beautiful girl who's also a princess?

1303
01:15:14,504 --> 01:15:16,038
No, sir. I am very happy.

1304
01:15:16,891 --> 01:15:17,885
Who wouldn't be?

1305
01:15:18,616 --> 01:15:20,306
Let's use this time profitably.

1306
01:15:20,966 --> 01:15:23,911
In a group which contains people
outside the immediate family.

1307
01:15:24,444 --> 01:15:27,151
You're not to leave the room
until dismissed by Her Highness.

1308
01:15:27,958 --> 01:15:30,201
You merely look at her questioningly.

1309
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:32,359
Her permission will be given by a nod.

1310
01:15:33,302 --> 01:15:34,753
Shall we practice that?

1311
01:15:42,071 --> 01:15:43,288
Mr Washburn.
- Yes?

1312
01:15:44,395 --> 01:15:46,109
What does a Prince Consort do?

1313
01:15:46,756 --> 01:15:47,686
I mean all day.

1314
01:15:48,206 --> 01:15:51,124
Well, there are many social functions
you will be obliged to attend.

1315
01:15:51,515 --> 01:15:53,780
Flower shows. Horse shows.
Things like that.

1316
01:15:54,451 --> 01:15:57,525
You said I'd have something important
to do once I'm out of the air force.

1317
01:15:57,937 --> 01:15:58,781
So you have.

1318
01:15:59,214 --> 01:16:01,945
Your position in the royal
family is most important.

1319
01:16:02,928 --> 01:16:04,144
You are to have children.

1320
01:16:05,064 --> 01:16:06,359
If possible, boys.

1321
01:16:08,003 --> 01:16:09,362
That is not a full day's work.

1322
01:16:10,421 --> 01:16:11,437
What else do I do?

1323
01:16:12,125 --> 01:16:12,997
Nothing else.

1324
01:16:13,880 --> 01:16:15,365
Nothing?
- Nothing.

1325
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,694
Where did we leave off?

1326
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:22,612
For permission to leave the room,
you look at Her Highness questioningly.

1327
01:16:23,372 --> 01:16:24,130
Try that.

1328
01:16:28,161 --> 01:16:28,794
No.

1329
01:17:23,634 --> 01:17:24,598
I'll race you.

1330
01:17:33,892 --> 01:17:34,822
[ Dog yapping ]

1331
01:17:42,817 --> 01:17:43,952
That's a good dog.

1332
01:17:44,318 --> 01:17:45,330
I know him.

1333
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:01,478
I'll show you everything.
One room at a time.

1334
01:18:02,355 --> 01:18:04,121
That is the president's study.

1335
01:18:04,621 --> 01:18:05,893
Next to it is his bedroom.

1336
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:07,844
Is he in there now?

1337
01:18:08,258 --> 01:18:10,342
No. He's at the office.
He won't be home until late.

1338
01:18:10,894 --> 01:18:12,345
This is my room. Come.

1339
01:18:20,018 --> 01:18:21,434
This is called The Lincoln room.

1340
01:18:21,678 --> 01:18:22,718
That was his bed.

1341
01:18:23,287 --> 01:18:25,904
The emancipation proclamation
was signed here.

1342
01:18:27,317 --> 01:18:28,753
That freed the slaves, you know.

1343
01:18:29,926 --> 01:18:31,830
You aren't very comfortable, are you?

1344
01:18:32,526 --> 01:18:34,565
I've never been here before.
- I mean with me.

1345
01:18:35,291 --> 01:18:35,906
Why.

1346
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:37,560
Yes I am.

1347
01:18:37,951 --> 01:18:40,880
Don't mind when they tell you how to act
with me. That's only in front of others.

1348
01:18:41,266 --> 01:18:42,911
When we're together we act as we please.

1349
01:18:44,395 --> 01:18:45,468
I'll get used to it.

1350
01:18:45,770 --> 01:18:47,337
It's a little new yet. That's all.

1351
01:18:47,797 --> 01:18:49,099
Nothing has changed, has it?

1352
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:51,938
Changed?
- Since two days ago.

1353
01:18:54,847 --> 01:18:55,891
No it hasn't, Mary.

1354
01:18:56,709 --> 01:18:57,381
Maria.

1355
01:19:00,187 --> 01:19:02,915
When we're alone, don't
you <i>ever</i> call me Maria.

1356
01:19:11,052 --> 01:19:11,724
Maria.

1357
01:19:17,771 --> 01:19:19,359
The usher will show you to your room.

1358
01:19:21,765 --> 01:19:25,085
Please manage not to be alone with
Her Highness unless you're chaperoned.

1359
01:19:25,552 --> 01:19:26,573
It is customary.

1360
01:19:27,153 --> 01:19:27,931
Yes, sir.

1361
01:19:35,583 --> 01:19:36,603
[ Door knocks ]

1362
01:19:37,460 --> 01:19:38,303
Come in.

1363
01:19:40,186 --> 01:19:42,185
Hello young man.
- Hello, Mr Washburn.

1364
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:43,770
We are waiting for you.

1365
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:44,979
Excuse me.

1366
01:19:45,817 --> 01:19:47,998
I was looking out the window.
I guess I forgot myself.

1367
01:19:48,344 --> 01:19:50,161
You are feeling well, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

1368
01:19:50,930 --> 01:19:52,330
You hardly touched your dinner.

1369
01:19:53,084 --> 01:19:54,071
I was not hungry.

1370
01:20:02,411 --> 01:20:04,980
Is the president there?
- No. The president is still working.

1371
01:20:05,397 --> 01:20:08,371
Unfortunately for him, there's no
such thing as a President's Union.

1372
01:20:17,965 --> 01:20:18,952
Sit there please.

1373
01:20:21,036 --> 01:20:23,077
Is that alright?
- It's perfectly alright.

1374
01:20:29,692 --> 01:20:31,899
This is as good a time
as any to get this done.

1375
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,316
These are the premarital agreements
between you and Her Highness.

1376
01:20:35,755 --> 01:20:38,368
They are to be included in the marriage
contract and they are customary.

1377
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:41,248
You could read them yourself,
which would take all night.

1378
01:20:41,834 --> 01:20:43,536
Or you can let me
explain what's in them.

1379
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,120
I guess you had better explain them.

1380
01:20:46,421 --> 01:20:47,923
The first is your marriage license.

1381
01:20:48,389 --> 01:20:51,382
The district of Columbia was willing to
waive the waiting period of three days.

1382
01:20:51,889 --> 01:20:52,790
We thank them.

1383
01:20:53,153 --> 01:20:57,396
The second is your agreement to give up
any right to a succession to the throne.

1384
01:20:57,998 --> 01:20:59,896
Since you are not of royal birth.

1385
01:21:00,396 --> 01:21:03,318
Even though the male heirs who
now outrank you should die.

1386
01:21:03,801 --> 01:21:07,281
The succession will skip you and
pass to the next heir of royal birth.

1387
01:21:07,975 --> 01:21:09,976
That is customary for a prince consort.

1388
01:21:11,093 --> 01:21:12,051
Is that alright?

1389
01:21:13,112 --> 01:21:14,042
That's alright.

1390
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:17,936
In the next, you give up the right to
the physical possession of the children.

1391
01:21:18,422 --> 01:21:19,524
You understand that?

1392
01:21:20,287 --> 01:21:21,131
Not exactly.

1393
01:21:21,436 --> 01:21:25,336
What it means is, the manner of their
education is left to the royal family.

1394
01:21:29,005 --> 01:21:29,649
Okay.

1395
01:21:30,343 --> 01:21:33,428
The next is merely you giving
up your American citizenship.

1396
01:21:35,293 --> 01:21:36,137
What's that?

1397
01:21:36,974 --> 01:21:38,562
You give up your American citizenship.

1398
01:21:41,338 --> 01:21:42,289
That did it.

1399
01:21:43,662 --> 01:21:44,277
Why?

Yes. I've got a family.

1406
01:21:55,898 --> 01:21:57,400
You will apologise and immediately.

1407
01:21:57,966 --> 01:21:58,552
Or?

1408
01:21:58,823 --> 01:21:59,409
Or?

1409
01:21:59,793 --> 01:22:01,170
Or there will be no marriage.

1410
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:03,279
I was just coming to that.

1411
01:22:03,655 --> 01:22:04,498
What's that?

1412
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:06,146
I'm not marrying Her Highness.

1413
01:22:06,411 --> 01:22:07,655
Not marrying Her Highness?

1414
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:09,825
Let's not be hasty.
We must discuss this alone.

1415
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:11,456
No. It's better this way.

1416
01:22:11,977 --> 01:22:13,924
I'm not giving up any
American citizenship.

1417
01:22:14,641 --> 01:22:17,496
I've never gotten over how lucky I was
to be born here in the first place.

1418
01:22:18,075 --> 01:22:19,958
And I didn't ask any
Highness to get married.

1419
01:22:21,135 --> 01:22:24,799
I asked a girl I thought was a homeless
refugee who was getting a job as a maid.

1420
01:22:25,670 --> 01:22:27,229
I thought other things about her too.

1421
01:22:27,598 --> 01:22:29,758
You'd be surprised what I thought.
- The man is demented.

1422
01:22:30,203 --> 01:22:32,989
I can't take an allowance from my wife
or ask her permission to leave a room.

1423
01:22:33,373 --> 01:22:34,693
But that is not important.

1424
01:22:35,514 --> 01:22:37,926
What will I say to my kid when he
asks me what I did in the war?

1425
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:39,798
Know what I'd have to say?

1426
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:40,895
Son.

1427
01:22:41,450 --> 01:22:42,642
There was a big fight.

1428
01:22:43,301 --> 01:22:45,774
The biggest fight the world was ever in.
The most important.

1429
01:22:46,525 --> 01:22:47,684
But I couldn't make it.

1430
01:22:48,095 --> 01:22:49,254
I was at a flower show.

1431
01:22:49,849 --> 01:22:51,065
I'd be ashamed of myself.

1432
01:22:51,915 --> 01:22:55,231
I thought you were ashamed when you told
the women you can't sew or knit or cook.

1433
01:22:55,525 --> 01:22:56,884
But you could learn something.

1434
01:22:57,274 --> 01:22:58,633
Even knitting a sweater helps.

1435
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:01,132
And if it's knit badly.

1436
01:23:02,312 --> 01:23:03,585
I'll wear it just the same.

1437
01:23:05,090 --> 01:23:07,879
You knit and I'll fly an aeroplane.
What do you say, Mary?

1438
01:23:08,377 --> 01:23:09,911
Don't dignify him with an answer.

1439
01:23:10,253 --> 01:23:12,106
I wish you'd marry me.
- You heard me, Maria.

1440
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,724
I'm crazy about you, Mary.

1441
01:23:14,463 --> 01:23:16,108
He can't do a thing after we're married.

1442
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:18,410
We'll have a lot of fun.
We love each other.

1443
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:20,557
Our family goes back 1,200 years.

1444
01:23:20,935 --> 01:23:22,462
Mine goes back to Adam and Eve.

1445
01:23:22,856 --> 01:23:24,329
Your child will be Alfred the 8th.

1446
01:23:24,610 --> 01:23:26,427
We'll start over with Eddie the 1st.
- Maria.

1447
01:23:27,509 --> 01:23:28,581
Don't say one word.

1448
01:23:28,796 --> 01:23:30,138
Isn't she allowed to talk?

1449
01:23:30,728 --> 01:23:32,228
Maria. Go to your room.

1450
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:38,239
Remember who you are.

1451
01:23:38,779 --> 01:23:40,098
You are a royal princess.

1452
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:42,038
Go to your room.

1453
01:23:52,903 --> 01:23:53,985
A royal princess.

1454
01:23:54,886 --> 01:23:56,275
You are nothing but a slave.

1455
01:24:06,711 --> 01:24:07,483
Get out.

1456
01:24:12,153 --> 01:24:13,317
Goodbye, Mr Washburn.

1457
01:24:14,173 --> 01:24:16,430
Thank you for everything.
- Goodbye, Mr O'Rourke.

1458
01:24:56,026 --> 01:24:56,984
Hey, buddy.

1459
01:24:57,709 --> 01:24:59,757
You've been walking around
here quite a while.

1460
01:25:00,456 --> 01:25:03,095
That's alright, isn't it?
- There is no law against it.

1461
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:07,645
What's your business here?

1462
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,430
I got no business here.

1463
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:10,866
I'm just walking.

1464
01:25:11,176 --> 01:25:12,084
Are you broke?

1465
01:25:12,299 --> 01:25:14,555
As a matter of fact, I doubt
I've enough to get a hotel.

1466
01:25:15,056 --> 01:25:17,878
Wouldn't make a difference if you had.
You can't get a room in Washington now.

1467
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:20,806
I'll stake you to half a
buck if you're hungry.

1468
01:25:21,917 --> 01:25:23,409
No thanks. I've enough to eat on.

1469
01:25:24,602 --> 01:25:25,932
And I know where I can sleep.

1470
01:25:26,946 --> 01:25:27,733
Excuse me.

1471
01:25:42,365 --> 01:25:43,554
What are you doing here?

1472
01:25:44,460 --> 01:25:46,425
I was invited here.
That's what I'm doing here.

1473
01:25:46,853 --> 01:25:48,726
I've got as much right
here as you have. More.

1474
01:25:52,071 --> 01:25:52,900
Shush.

1475
01:26:11,133 --> 01:26:12,120
Goodnight, Maria.

1476
01:26:32,879 --> 01:26:33,874
I didn't have ..

1477
01:26:35,506 --> 01:26:37,275
I didn't have any place else to sleep.

1478
01:27:08,475 --> 01:27:10,558
Was the president angry when
he found out what I did?

1479
01:27:10,963 --> 01:27:13,040
No. But he is very fond of Maria.

1480
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,134
So, of course he was
a little disappointed.

1481
01:27:16,910 --> 01:27:19,525
If he wants me to marry her.
If it's for morale or something.

1482
01:27:20,211 --> 01:27:21,398
I'll go through with it.

1483
01:27:22,024 --> 01:27:25,266
In my country we can ask a man to charge
a machine gun with his bare hands.

1484
01:27:26,025 --> 01:27:28,721
But we can't ask him to marry
a girl he won't be happy with.

1485
01:27:29,161 --> 01:27:30,232
It's too much.

1486
01:27:31,193 --> 01:27:32,721
Also, it's probably democracy.

1487
01:27:34,815 --> 01:27:36,746
I thought for a minute she
was going to marry me.

1488
01:27:37,330 --> 01:27:38,258
So did I, son.

1489
01:27:39,296 --> 01:27:40,455
But she's a grown girl.

1490
01:27:40,986 --> 01:27:42,408
Nobody can help her but herself.

1491
01:27:43,463 --> 01:27:44,250
Goodnight.

1492
01:27:44,782 --> 01:27:45,941
Goodnight, Mr Washburn.

1493
01:28:05,989 --> 01:28:08,297
That's what I am: a slave.

1494
01:28:09,118 --> 01:28:10,206
A slave.

1495
01:28:12,035 --> 01:28:15,509
Lincoln freed the slaves
but he didn't free me.

1496
01:28:18,570 --> 01:28:19,598
This is his bed.

1497
01:28:21,026 --> 01:28:22,752
You'd think he'd come into this room.

1498
01:28:27,878 --> 01:28:28,607
Lincoln?

1499
01:28:33,879 --> 01:28:34,620
Shush.

1500
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:36,009
Shush.

1501
01:28:46,759 --> 01:28:48,854
Isn't the president
supposed to free slaves?

1502
01:29:12,647 --> 01:29:13,548
Take it, Fala.

1503
01:29:14,788 --> 01:29:15,934
Go ahead. Take it.

1504
01:29:19,555 --> 01:29:20,643
Take it, Fala.

1505
01:29:26,049 --> 01:29:27,267
Please Fala.

1506
01:29:31,523 --> 01:29:32,407
Go on, Fala.

1507
01:29:32,927 --> 01:29:33,742
Go on.

1508
01:29:34,142 --> 01:29:35,956
Go to him, Fala. Go on.

1509
01:30:08,489 --> 01:30:09,831
The president is up.

1510
01:30:17,161 --> 01:30:17,919
Yes, sir?

1511
01:30:40,825 --> 01:30:41,785
Shush.

1512
01:30:45,688 --> 01:30:48,153
I brought along a guard in
case we're short of a witness.

1513
01:30:48,488 --> 01:30:49,141
Fine.

1514
01:30:50,194 --> 01:30:51,571
Take your shoes off.

1515
01:30:52,257 --> 01:30:53,772
Her uncle is a very light sleeper.

1516
01:30:54,236 --> 01:30:55,613
Come on. Get 'em off.

1517
01:31:05,782 --> 01:31:06,899
Take your shoes off.

1518
01:31:32,974 --> 01:31:34,521
Will you marry your refugee?

1519
01:31:35,642 --> 01:31:36,343
Will I?

1520
01:31:36,777 --> 01:31:38,829
Shush. For heaven's sake.

1521
01:31:39,982 --> 01:31:40,683
Will I?

1522
01:31:44,488 --> 01:31:45,986
Go into the study, everybody.

1523
01:31:47,022 --> 01:31:48,386
Take off your shoes.

1524
01:31:59,557 --> 01:32:01,307
Let's hurry this. My feet are cold.

1525
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:04,527
Let's talk lower.
Or we may start a brand-new war.

1526
01:32:04,946 --> 01:32:06,917
You got everything?
- Is there a marriage license?

1527
01:32:07,307 --> 01:32:08,262
Right here.

1528
01:32:09,409 --> 01:32:11,140
You two are witnesses.
That's all we need.

1529
01:32:11,415 --> 01:32:13,398
Where is that boy?
- Come on, son.

1530
01:32:23,190 --> 01:32:24,263
Have you got a ring?

1531
01:32:25,494 --> 01:32:26,252
Yes, sir.

1532
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:30,993
It's on my keychain.
- Hurry up.

1533
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,569
Just a minute please.

1534
01:32:38,103 --> 01:32:40,058
I'd like to give you
this engagement ring first.

1535
01:32:40,452 --> 01:32:41,468
For heaven's sake.

1536
01:32:43,431 --> 01:32:44,532
The diamond is small.

1537
01:32:45,287 --> 01:32:46,612
But my love for you is not.

1538
01:32:47,123 --> 01:32:48,536
It's a beautiful diamond.

1539
01:32:48,966 --> 01:32:50,892
Excuse me, folks. But my feet are cold.

1540
01:32:51,348 --> 01:32:53,628
You can talk like that later. Go ahead.

1541
01:32:54,101 --> 01:32:56,542
Take this man to be your wedded husband?
- I do.

1542
01:32:56,982 --> 01:32:59,378
Take this woman to be your wedded wife?
- I do.

1543
01:32:59,845 --> 01:33:02,034
By powers invested in me I now
pronounce you man and wife.

1544
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:03,778
Put the ring on. Get me my shoes.

1545
01:33:04,261 --> 01:33:06,696
Say, is that all?
I don't think that is legal.

1546
01:33:07,044 --> 01:33:08,359
He's a supreme court judge.

1547
01:33:08,574 --> 01:33:11,187
If he can't make a marriage legal,
everyone in America is Ipso Facto.

1548
01:33:11,592 --> 01:33:12,865
Will you get out of here?

1549
01:33:13,351 --> 01:33:14,166
Come, dear.

1550
01:33:17,469 --> 01:33:20,313
I don't know if I have enough money.
- For heaven's sake.

1551
01:33:25,285 --> 01:33:26,204
Excuse me.

1552
01:33:34,394 --> 01:33:36,038
It was wonderful of them to do that.

1553
01:33:36,408 --> 01:33:38,296
But I am worried.
- Why?

1554
01:33:39,116 --> 01:33:41,246
I know the supreme court
judge can't get in trouble.

1555
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:43,546
He has a life job. They can't fire him.

1556
01:33:44,250 --> 01:33:46,642
Mr Washburn is a big man in the
state department. He is alright.

1557
01:33:47,154 --> 01:33:48,084
But that guard.

1558
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:50,563
Who was watching. Who I bumped into.

1559
01:33:51,038 --> 01:33:52,225
He may get into trouble.

1560
01:33:52,570 --> 01:33:54,186
That wasn't any guard you bumped into.

1561
01:33:54,617 --> 01:33:55,776
That was the President.

1562
01:33:57,588 --> 01:33:58,776
The President?

1563
01:34:00,921 --> 01:34:02,852
Holy mackerel. I tipped him a buck.

1564
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:04,969
And he took it.

1565
01:34:06,567 --> 01:34:07,299
Come.

1566
01:34:19,085 --> 01:34:19,966
..w-g..
